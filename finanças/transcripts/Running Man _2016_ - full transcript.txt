How mean of you. [Her?] Little Leopard, Little Leopard. It's me. I'm the leopard. [He... Is the Murderer?] The four girls have weird gazes. That's because they saw you. That's because they saw you. If you steal it from me, you'll be very ashamed. It shows that you have lots of strength, but no brain. [He... Is the Murderer?] Please let me clues soon. [Her?] [Her?] [Him?] [Them?] [Murderer?] I will rip off someone's name tag and prove my loyalty. - How many left? Oh really? - Only two. Maybe. - Okay see you later. - Okay see you later. What do you mean? It's not the time to rip name tags. - I don't know. - Are you part of our team or their team? Mole. [Strong Evidence Towards It] [Darkness over Him] [Exactly who is the murderer?!] If you guys guess the correct person We will rip off their nametag, And serve justice correctly. But please pay attention. If you report the wrong person then you'll be arrested For disorderly conduct and your nametag will be ripped. [Murderer] Null. What do you want to do? - I swear that I'm really not the mole. I swear. - Who are you? I'm really not the mole. I swear. I don't even know why I came. I just found that clue which is Single Lady. ♪ I'm a single lady ♪ R sign is on it. Single Lady? Beyonce. [Clue: Single Lady] The clue is Single Lady. Which means a lady that is single. Yi Lin was together with us and then Guo Jing Fei was murdered. It definitely isn't Yi Lin and then Angelababy has Huang Xiao Ming so she isn't a single lady. Lynn and Yi Yi are both the most suspected people. Really. She's even behind right now wanting to kill me. Lynn Xiong and Yi Yi. It's one of them. - You're not the killer right? - No. - You're not the killer? - What's killer? Guo Jing Fei, out. When Guo Jing Fei, we were— - We were together. We were together. So Bao Qiang, Bao Bao... -Wang Baoqiang was there. -It's possible that it's BaoBao. Yes. I feel this killer is among these few people. The most suspected person is this Yi Yi. I feel like Yi Yi is abnormal. Why is she abnormal? Say, we were together since the beginning. She joined half way through so I think this is a big problem. - It was hard for me to find this. - Let me see it. -You're a tour guide, what are you doing here? -Let me take a look. Do you have a name tag behind you? We're not short on people. We have just enough people. It's because she appear so there was a killer. I one hundred percent trust Yi Lin. She's a strong warrior. Reliable. See it? Look at her. She's so focused on looking for clues. Is she possible that she's a suspect? People like me won't suspect her. I was tricked by him. I played with him for so long and he didn't tell me. Use the gun and take care of him. Hurry and tell me how Guo Jing Fei died. - He was dumb to death. - Then, it's possible. Right. It makes sense now. Everything makes sense now. There's no killer at all. - He was dumb to death. - Maybe he was running and slipped. Out. [Found Something] This money is for praying. [Sorry, Sorry] Hey. [Clue: Phillipines Grilled Pork] - Brother Zhong Guo, were you two together the whole time? - Yes. You two were together all the way, right? Yeah. We are doing that. So, the the killer isn't you two. Then, it's not among us. You're not the murder? You're not the killer? No, no. I'm not the killer because we all - were together. - Lets share a clue with you guys. - We can share right? - I found one hint, - it's a song. - Song? - What song? - Single Lady by Beyonce. - Single Lady? So I'm thinking about if this... the killer is a girl. - Is a single lady. - Single Lady? Or just single? - Or just single? - Single, not married so single. - Maybe. - Yeah. - Maybe. - Yeah, just single. Could it be Yi Yi? She's always been alone. Yi Yi, are you single? What does that have to do with you? - Tell me if you're single or not. I know. - I'm on the same team as you guys. If I tell you if I'm single or not then let me join your team, alright? No, it's not with joining. It's for a clue. It has nothing to do with joining. - The clue I just found - Did you find it? has a problem with people who are single. Okay, then I'll tell you that I'm single. - Alright. Then, you have a problem. - Then, you have a problem. - Right. - If I told you guys then why would there be a problem with me? When I was the mole last time, I also told people that I have a problem. If you have a secret lover then you wouldn't say it in front of the cameras. That's right and you showed up halfway. How come everytime Chen He laughs... You wouldn't say it in front of the cameras eve if you secretly got married. She can't even explain her own identity. [Is the Killer Yi Yi?] -I'm telling you guys so sincerely that I am. -How are you sincere? Also, look. I pick the weaker team. I didn't go and choose the stronger team. - Guo Jing Fei is out. We're stronger alright? - Who said that their team is strong? What does that mean? - Are we weak? What do we do? - What does that mean? What do you mean Yi Yi? I've decided to follow them to hear what they're talking about. - Like a pig? - Don't forget. How do you want me to prove my loyalty? You can use a clue or use something to exchange for it. I lead him and found it with him. This killer is always by themselves. By themselves. Who do you think it is? She told me to be careful of Bao Qiang. I think that it seems like Bao Qiang because when Guo Jing Fei was out just then, he was by his side. Zheng Kai and I were at a far place. - Lynn Xiong and Jin Zhong Guo— - We were at a far place. Think about who wasn't together with you guys. - Only the three of them. - Only the three of them. The target is obvious. You guys were together all along, right? - We were together? - We were together. But you are really so good at mischief-making. I'm really telling you the information. I'm not trying to trick you, okay? Good sister. Good sister. I saw that you were so close to Bao Qiang so I was just warning you. - Is it Bao Qiang? I feel like it's Yi Yi. - It's possible that it's Yi Yi. I think it's Yi Yi. It must be her. Then why does Li Chen keep being together with them? - Li Chen is dumb. Yes. - He's always been dumb. - Then, let our team see it first. - We'll look at it ourselves. - You guys back up. - Which team? - Us. Come over. - Our own people. - She's also our team. - She's not. She's the other team. I really feel insecure. I'll tell you who to find. Go find Jin Zhong Guo. He's the safest. My English isn't good. It's ok. Just stand next to him and stay alive. [My Goodness] You're peeking. [Is there a Clue?] Peeking. Bao Bao, are you the killer? I figured that it might be Lynn Xiong. Then, it's you. If it's me then go report it. Baby, we have a close relationship. Do you think I will lie to you? Do you think I would lie to you? So, you have to be careful of of them people from your team. Be on guard. You have to stay alive. Baby, you have to stay alive. The killer will take actions. There's no chance to kill. Everyone is very smart, let me tell you. Look. I told you to look for a R. A place like this, there must be- there's an R so there must be something. If there's an R symbol, there must be something here. There must be. If it's Baby then she would have a special power. It's difficult for Baby to do this herself. - But she could have— - Wang Bao Qiang, out! [Wang Bao Qiang, out!] Wang Bao Qiang, out! You hear that? - Yeah. - Wang Bao Qiang, out! It's not Bao Qiang. Wang Bao Qiang, out! - Li Chen, Jin Zhong Guo, Baby. - Yi Yi. Lets see where's Yi Yi. [Murderer] [Murderer Kills Once Again] - Where's Li Chen? - Li Chen is here. I didn't hear the drum. Bao Qiang was over there. He was out when he was alone. - You went there? Stop pretending! - I was watching over there. - No. She went. - Then, they told me that Wang Bao Qiang— - Fellas. Fellas. - Who reported the wrong person? - Everybody. Everyone is here expect one person, Yi Yi. - No? - Without the nametag? - No. No. - Not the nametag. - How could I rip Bao Qiang's name tag? - Perhaps it's not ripping the name tag. I think right now, two people have problems. The two people with problems are: one, Yi Yi because all of us are here and Yi Yi isn't here. Second, is Baby. Wait. If it's really me then why would I told them that I went and looked for Wang Bao Qiang? So we have to find the killer first. Yi Yi doesn't dare to appear right now. Right. Yi Yi doesn't dare to appear. Then, who is going to go report Yi Yi? But if you report the wrong person then you'll be out. If you report the wrong person You will be arrested for misorderly conduct. [You're Out If You Report Wrong] For my little friends I'm going to use all my effort to report that bad woman. I have to report Yi Yi because it must be her, there's no one else. I found the real puzzle pieces. So if that want me to join their team I can give them the puzzle pieces. I was just looking for you. Yi Lin! - Yi Lin! Come over here! . - What are you going to give me? - I don't need that. - Why? - I already have it. - Is it the same? It's the same. I'm already willing to give it to you. Why aren't you willing to let me join your team? It's not my call to add you or not. Go find Li Chen. He's our the captain of our team. I want to make a report! Yi Yi! Are you sure she's the killer? - Lin Lin. - Are you from our team? Ding. I'm sure. Someone reported a false report. Sie Yi Lin, out. Sie Yi Lin, out. Someone reported a false report. Sie Yi Lin, out. - Sie Yi Lin, out. - What? Why is she out? Sie Yi Lin! I told you it wasn't me. Take revenge for me. [Murderer] Chen He! What? - You guys already know who Sie Yi Lin report right? - She reported you? Right. She out so it's not me right? - It's not you. - Right! How would be know who she reported? It might be her. She reported me! I was by her side! I don't trust anyone right now. Come. Let's high five first. - Thanks. - You also put it here? We have a good chemistry. [Clue: Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth] -Gold. -Wood. -Water, Fire, Earth. -It's Jin. Wood is Li Chen's Li. But it doesn't seem like Jin Zhong Guo. They don't trust me. I have to make them trust me and then I can make a report. I can tell you the whole story. We don't want to hear it. I was in front of her and I heard her report me so then she was out and then I saw that she got her name tag ripped. You're the most suspected right now. And then, When Bao Qiang was out, everyone was there except you. Only I wasn't there? Are you sure I was the only one that wasn't there? Only you weren't there. Really. Follow me. I'll go report Lynn Xiong alright? Go report whoever you want to report. If it wasn't me then wouldn't you guys know that i'm innocent Then you'd know I'm not the killer and Lynn Xiong isn't either. Go and report Lynn Xiong. Go. - We trust you. Go. - Go. But the main point is if I report Lynn Xiong and if it wasn't Lynn Xiong then... [I'm Out...] We don't have a way either. The killer is confused herself. She probably wants to take us over there and kill us. She's got ways to kill us, right? Go, go. It's fine. We'll let you go. Are you sure it isn't Baby? - Does anyone know if someone is involved in the Philippines? - No. Here's a hint. [Clue: Beauty Beast Blood] I haven't showed this to Baby. Baby, Beast, Blood. At that time everyone was there except Baby who was running over there. [The Hints All Point to Angelababy...] [Beauty=Baby?] Just one. Over there. You went there? How could I rip Bao Qiang? Maybe it's not ripping nametags. Could Baby be the killer? [Is the Murderer Really Baby?] - Five minutes. Give me five minutes. - Okay. Please step back fifty meters away, alright? I'll go make a report. She's really going to make a report? -That's cool. -Let us continue investigating. The five elements are: metal, wood, water, fire, earth. We won't be talking and then at the end, you'll rip my nametag? - Let me ask you guys one last thing. - I don't want to hear it. Where did you hear the song Single Lady from? Go do whatever you want to do. -Do what you want. We'll look at this ourselves. -You're so annoying. Girls should give boys some space. - Right. - Learn to have some repsect, alright? If you don't have space then how can we be together? Nobody wants to be with you guys. Five elements. Five elements. - Five elements. - Five elements. We're like two idiots. We've learned nothing. I want to confirm something with you guys. You three were all here? You're not the killer. -No! - You're not the killer. - We know you're not. - Because Yi Lin reported you and then she— - How did you know Yi Lin reported me? - We all know you're not the killer. - Yeah. - How come those two idiots still think I'm the killer? - Whih two idiots? Chen He and - Zu Lan. - Because at that time, they weren't next to us when we found out. I'm tired to death. -You're not. You're not. -Do you believe me now? They proved that I'm innocent so I'm not the killer. Everyone in the Red Team are idiots. You're even wearing their color. Take it off. [Take it Off?] I really hate you guys. I really wanted to become a team with you guys but you guys didn't accept me. I saw Yilin outed by them 50 meters out. Who was she out by? Those soldiers because she reported me. You guys are really dumb. Let me ask you. What if she's telling lies? I already got the things. Even like this, he still thinking I'm telling lies. It's the truth. Yes. She's telling the truth. Yi Lin reported her. - I'm kidding. - She's about to cry. I'll give you tanghulu (T/N candied fruit on a stick) for you to eat. I don't want to eat. I got this through eating tanghulu. I got this hint, and nobody even wants it. This is useless. We already have a lot. - So annoying. - How come it's so ugly? Lets leave it like this. If I put up my hair then I'm the killer. If I put it down then I'm not the killer. Come with me and I'll report Baby. If you lose then you'll be out. If I'm out then I'm out. It's alright. Let's go. This is terrifying. [To Prove Her Innocence, Yi Yi Goes to Report] I'm willing Brother Chen, although you guys weren't willing to trust me. Someone is reporting? Who is drumming? The killer is... Because if all of you guys are together then I can prove that I'm not and then when I saw the Sie Yi Lin was out and she said my name. Then, don't drum. It's Baby. If I don't drum then someone else will be out. The killer is... Angelababy! Are you sure? I'm sure. Someone reported falsely. Someone reported falsely. Yi Yi out. -Get her. -Yi Yi out. -Who are you? -I swear I'm really not the mole. I swear. But they all don't believe me. You guys are so experienced at this. I'm a newbie, there's no way I can win this over you guys. Hurry and tell them and let me join you guys. I really don't want to play alone here. Okay. Are you sure? I'm sure! Okay. You guys have to believe me. Why did you guys not believe me? -I know you're not. I know. -Take her away. Be gentle. Every time someone's out, I'm always alone. None of them were with me. So there's no way for me to prove that I'm not the killer. Baoqiang. Wang Baoqiang. Where are you? I'm Yi Yi. You should know that I didn't kill you, right? Wang Baoqiang. You know I didn't kill you, right? Wang Baoqiang. [Not Suspicious] -You heard "Angelababy". -I heard her report it. And then she got out. Yes, she reported me. I was listening from the botttom. So it's also not you. Who else is there? Not me. I think it might be Chen He or Cholam. -I see it. -What? -I see it. Is it useful? Idiot. Stupid. He must have been against this wall. -Went to get that thing and then when he got it -And then he got out. And then the nametag stuck to the wall. I found it! Wang Baoqiang out. [Wang Baoqiang Out] My nametag. - Is Jin Zhong Guo single? - He's single. - Li Chen is also single. - Zheng Kai is single. But he doesn't have the five elements. - Zheng Kai? - Among the two clues, he doesn't qualify for any of them. Are you talking about Zheng Kai? Also if he wanted to kill then he would of done it earlier. He's really impatient so he would make people out really fast. Goddess, I beg you. Let us find the killer soon. I don't care if I get the prize or not. I just don't want the killer to make our brothers and sisters get out. Thanks. Thanks. Let me find the killer. You scared me. Please help me in becoming rich. To find that 88,888 rmb. And then, after I find it, I want to become rich, become rich. Lots of money rolling in. Make good business. Looks like we're not the same people. What did you pray for? I said let's find who who's the killer and then eliminate the killer. - That's right. - Yes. Big fortune, big fortune. Let me find big fortune. Rock paper scissors. This is scissors. Rock paper scissors. Winner. Three times? One two three. One two three. One two three. Winner! Wow. - Congrats. - Okay. Let's share. Three, eight, five, fourteen. Three, eight, five, fourteen.

It's the same information. Yeah. It doesn't match. Three, eight, five, fourteen. [3, 8, 5, 14] [Beauty Beast Blood] - Blood. - Beauty Beast - Beauty that means— - Blood - Beautiful guy or beautiful woman. - Blood. - Beauty. Beast. Blood. - Beauty. [Currently, the Other Team] Five elements. Let's continue to search. I think the guy just then has a problem. I'll go look for him. Actually, I've always had a clue that I didn't tell him. The tape. [Clue: R] This tape might be an important clue. Seventy-seven. The length is seventy-seven. What has the length of seventy-seven? Rock paper scissors. Ok. Please. Only you can help me. I think the entire village's last hint is in your hands. Really. Someone took this clue. They took it? An important clue was taken away by them right? Bao Qiang. Not Bao Qiang. Zulan. Bao Qiang. Baoqiang. No. Zulan. Come. Baoqiang. Zulan. Here. There's a really important clue but it was taken by someone else. It's Baby. Then let's go find Baby. I won't hurt her. Chen He and Wang Cholam found so many clues but they didn't go report anyone. How about I go report one? Anyway, I think Chen He, Cholam, Jin Jongkook, and Lynn Xiong is all possible. I just think you're not possible. I also think you're not possible. [I'm Here to Protect You] That's right. -Sit. -Are you the killer? You felt bad after seeing Yi Yi. I feel bad seeing everyone. I feel bad seeing anyone get out. Because they are all my Brothers and sisters. [Suspicions Opens Up in the Remaining Members] You're not the killer. -I'm not the killer. -You're not the killer, but do you have some hints? Yes. I have. Three. Eight. Five. Three. Eight. Five. I'm guessing, sometimes in Korea with Running Man This is the stroke of the characters. Three+eight=11. It's not Li Chen. What is this? Beauty Beast Blood. What does this beast mean? Beauty, beautiful girl. Beast, beautiful, and blood. What do you think that's the B blood type? [Beauty Beast Blood = Blood Type B?] Beautiful, beast, blood. Has anyone suspected you? Philippine Roast Pig. No. [Alarmed] I'm going to go report Chen He. [Friday CP Going to Report] I'm going to report Jin Jongkook. Because usually Chen He has always -Been this type of role. -The mole. Baobao is already out so Have you suspected Wang Cholam? I don't think he has the patience to do it. Chen He and Cholam. Chen He and Cholam, because they're always together. Baby. I know you found a really important hint. I'll share my clues with you. Okay. -I know you've been reported. -Right. My clue is two words. Five Elements. [Five Elements] -Five elements? -Yes. Gold, wood, water, fire, earth. Jin Jongkook. Did anyone report Jin Jongkook? [Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth] [Gold (same pronouciation as Jin) Jongkook] Zheng Kai, no! Who are you reporting? Who is he reporting? I was too late. Who did you report? Who did you report? -You. -What? -You. -Me? That's right. What's wrong with your brain? Who did you report? -He reported me. -You reported him? That's right. Send my fellow soldier. -Are you singing for yourself? -Go on a journey. -I just told you not to. -Someone reported wrong. Someone reported wrong. -He showed me a clue earlier. I immediately said no. Someone reported wrong. Someone reported wrong. Zheng Kai out. Zheng Kai, Zheng Kai Out. -The farewell bell rings. -Then who is it? Then who is it? Tell me who is it? I'm so reluctant. Who is it? [Murderer] Gold, wood, water, fire, earth. Five elements. It's the five elements Gold word (Jin). -Jin Jongkook. I'm reporting him right now. Unless you're it. -There's also Li Chen. I'm definitely not. Angela. Gold, wood, water, fire, earth. You're right. Yes. It's really him? I was only away from him for two minutes. Maybe he has another way of outing people. If it's not Jin Jongkook, it's definitely Wang Cholam. You guys can definitely win this. He was with me the entire time. -The entire time. -Jin Jongkook was also with him the entire time. But we don't know what way is used to out people. It's fine. But Li Chen, Li Chen, No. Li Chen, the clues aren't right. Li Chen doesn't fit the clues. If it's not him then I'm going up there to report Li Chen. Who else is there? I- If it's not him, we can keep looking. Keep looking. Who else is there? Not, not you? I'm not the killer. -Hurry up. -Hurry up. I can't take it. Hit it. Hurry. But why is Jin Jongkook so slow at killing people? Aw, man. -It's not you? -I hope you're not the killer. It's not you? No, I'm not. I'm not the killer. Because every time, the production team would make him become -I'm not a killer. -The strongest person. I can't trust you anyway. I can't trust you anyway. Right. So, that's what I think right now. Let me think. Let me think one last time. Think one last time. Your name is- How do you write it? Xiong. Dai. Lin. Right. Actually, I can't trust anybody right now. Chen He- Chen He is single. -Wang Cholam is single, right? -Yes. Still, still. He's not married yet. -Yes. Then, Wang Cholam. Xiong Dai Lin. Xiong Dai Lin, she's- she's not a killer. -You're not killer? -Me? I'm not the killer. You or Wang Cholam. That's what I think. If Li Chen's not it, then it's Wang Cholam. Or it's you. I was just reported. Are you dumb? -Reported by who? Zheng Kai reported me and he died. Okay. Wait. Wait. Let me tell you if it's not Li Chen, then it's Cholam. -Wait. Wait. Why did Li Chen cry? I asked him if he's it or not and why he cried. When he saw Yi Yi get caught, He kept looking down and hugging his head. I said let's go, To go find the hints but he didn't move at all. Then afterward, he didn't stay together with us. [It Seems Like He Noticed Something] What's your blood type? -B. -B? Yes. -Your blood type is B? -Yes. Come on, everyone, maybe is B. [Li Chen's Blood Type is B?!] Yeah, I know. Wood can also be Li Chen's wood. (T/N There's a wood character in Li) Wood is also Li, but it's probably not you. -What is gold, wood, water, fire, earth? -Beautiful. -Beast, blood. -Blood? [Red Clothes?] Li Chen is also a beast. The only way to prove their innocence is for you to win. Prove whose innocence? So, what is the message? I'm just thinking. A, B, C. A, B, C, D, -E, F, G. -Maybe it's telephone number. -H. A, B, C. A, B, C. [Murderer] J, K, L, M, N. C-H-E-N, Chen. [3.8.5.14] [C.H.E.N.] Chen. Chen. Chen. -I found it. -What did you find? English letters. The third one, three. Eight. A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. C-H Then, that's Chen. [So it's] [Li Chen!!!] Li Chen. Come here, Li Chen. Li Chen! Sorry. Sorry. Chen! Yes. You're very smart. -Jin Jongkook out. -I knew it. Jin Jongkook out. Someone reported correctly. Game is over. No. But I really feel relieved, do you know? -You are very very smart. -It's Chen. Yes. This is my name. Sorry. It's definitely because he feels guilty after ripping other peoples' nametags. Chen He immediately saw through All my expressions. Yi Yi said she felt wronged that we were all suspicious of her. Right. They were framed. You have to prove their innocence. It's not you? You ripped them, then they cried, and you felt bad. All the hints -All the hints point to me. -Li Chen failed. Are you the killer? White Tiger failed. [He can't do it] When he cried because of his brothers' The Black Tiger's hatred also disappeared. I know the game rules. I can actually rip their nametags now. When asked about how he felt about his defeat, he said I was wrong. [Clue: Single Lady] [Le Chen is Single] [Clue: Philippine Roast Pig] [Philippine Roast Pig's English is Lechon. Sounds like Li Chen] [Clue: Five Elements] [Li Chen's Name has Wood] [Clue: Beauty Beast Blood] [Li Chen is Blood Type B] [Clue: 3 8 5 14] [3 8 5 14 in the Alphabet is C, H, E, N] [Clue: Ruler] [Li Chen's Weight is 77 (sounds similar to ruler) kg] [Murderer] It's pointless now. It's not at the ripping nametags stage yet. Really? -Guo Jingfei out. -I broke a record again. Guo Jingfei -Out. -Don't say it's me. -Nice. -I love you. The smartest person in the universe is Jin Jongkook, you're fierce but can you be more fierce that a gun? Your wallet? It's okay if I can't find those. It's fine as long as I find these. This movie will definitely be a hit. -Go away. -Little Egg. Little Egg. Little Egg, come back. If you continue this, I'll cook you. Don't you dare say that about my Little Egg. No. He only remembers your name. He doesn't know anyone else. That's right. I'm smarter. -What's my name? What's my name? -That's because your name's on your back. Something that ended with Baby. It's all over already. -Over already. -You're wrong. She's called Angela Monkey. What's my name? -It's Zheng something. -He doesn't recognize the name on the back. Zheng Qi.
