Whoever approaches the Spirit will feel its warmth, hence his heart will be lifted up to new heights. St. Anthony of Lisbon Homily delivered in Forli, Italy, during the Whit Sunday of 1222 Hello, S?rgio? Finally! I've been trying to call you for hours... Hello? Can you hear me? Of course it's Fernando. You're the one who's calling. Who did you expect? S?rgio? I can't hear you. Yes, everything is fine. What? Hello? The reception isn't very good here. Yes, I've been taking my medicine. I'm old enough to take care of myself. Don't be silly... Hello? You're breaking up. I don't know if you're still there. We'll talk later. I'm hanging up. Love. THE ORNITHOLOGIST June 20th, 10:30 AM. The Aquila chrysaetus chicks have left their nest in Devil's Peak, but remain in the surroundings. One had white spots in the center of its wings and on the inside of its tail hovering over the hill where the nest is. The parents are watching nearby. June 20th, 11:00 AM. A colony of Gyps fulvus nests is Puio's Crag, as usual, but there are fewer of them this year. Lin? Lin? Where are you? Dimwit! Chicken! - You're bleeding. That's enough! Fei, we should keep going. C'mon, let's go. This forest never ends! St. James has abandoned us. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. Look, there's a man down there! Do you think he's dead? I don't know. Let's have a look. - No, I'm scared. We should go. Don't be stupid. He might need our help. St. Anthony said: "A good Christian, just like a bee, is always busy with something useful, for idle hands are the Devil's workshop". What if he's dead? Get him out of the water! What are you waiting for? Help me! He's alive! Get the emergency kit. But we're lost. What can we do now? Yes, we'll go with him! We're surrounded by forest spirits. What was that? Tengu! The spirits came back. I'm scared of the Devil! I'm afraid he made us stray away from the path. He has no faith. One day, he'll find the way. Fernando can protect us. Lin! C'mon, hurry up! We are all going to die! What if we let him free? No, it's too risky. He must stay with us. He needs time to think it over. No, he's lying. He's not ready yet. Let's light up the fire. Did you hear that? Probably it's just an animal. - What if he escapes? No, we tied him up tight. We tried to reason with him. Tomorrow, he'll get what he deserves. Yes, tomorrow, we'll castrate him! Those Chinese bitches, they took my map. Missed calls: S?rgio "Don't forget your medicine. I like you better alive:)" Shit... Hello? I had an accident. The reception is bad. Hello? Can you hear me? "Fernando, I can't reach you. Why don't you call me? I'm worried. Have you seen any storks yet? Miss you:) Call me. Love XX" June 23d. I've found my backpack, it's empty. I'm at a small river beach where a strange ritual took place. My kayak was torn apart. There are the remains of a recent campfire. I've found my ID card with burnt holes in my eyes and no fingerprint. The Chinese girls were right. Something strange is going on here. (in Mirandese) C'mon, boys! Give all you've got! Light up a fire! Bring more wood, mate! No one can stop us! C'mon, bring more wood! I'm gonna take a leak. Bring more wood! Bring more wine! Bottoms up! Drink some more! Give all you've got! C'mon, boys! Listen up! That's the sound of a wild boar. C'mon, boys! Let's hunt it down! Did you see it? - Don't let it go! Hit it! There it is! - Take it down. What a beast! - Look at that. It's huge! Holy fuck, it's a real monster! Hit it! Look at that! No one can stop us! Easy. Everything is fine. Easy. Good morning! Good morning... Hello. I'm Fernando. I'm glad I've found you. You won't believe what happened. I was going down the river. I was watching birds. I'm an ornithologist. I need your help. Is there a village nearby? I need to make a call and ask someone to pick me up. Do you understand? What's wrong with you? Are you a retard or something? Can't you speak Portuguese? You are deaf and dumb. I'm so sorry, I didn't know. Calm down, everything is fine. Where did you find that sweatshirt? I'm talking to you! Where did you find this sweatshirt? That's mine. Where did you find it? Did you steal it? You've met the Chinese girls? You stole my stuff from them? Do you understand? Where is the rest of my stuff? There was a pill box. Answer me! What are you going to do with that knife? Do you want to kill me? Calm down, I just want to know if you have my medicine. Jesus... Do you think it's recording? We will meet again very soon. How did you get in here? You scared the hell out of me. Easy. I'm not going to hurt you. Let me see that wing. It doesn't look good. It hurts? Well, you have a broken wing. Sleep tight. You'll feel better in a couple of days. Your wing wasn't broken after all... Fuck off, get away from me! You fish, my brothers, how did you end up here? During the Great Flood, when all other animals perished, you were unharmed and survived like no other creature. With your fins and the strength to go freely wherever you want, how did you end up in these dark waters? Why don't you go looking for clearer and purer waters, so you can see the paths you shall take and the food you shall eat? (in Latin) Stop! Stop. Go, Melampus! Easy. Shut up! Melampus. Are you alright? - Yes, I think so. I don't know what happened. - You were sleeping out here. Are you lost? Do you want us to take you somewhere? No, I'm camping nearby. Looks like the dogs are fond of you. I've never seen them act like this. Animals are fond of me. You really don't want us to take you somewhere else? Think about it. It's not a problem, all it takes is a phone call. No. No, I'm alright. So we're going to go. We're done hunting. Have a safe journey. It is waiting for you. Have a good day, Anthony. - My name is Fernando. Have a good day! Anthony! Jesus... Don't you remember me? No. I remember very few things. I mean... last night... I think it was last night. I died last night. I was right here, in the woods, with my friends, drinking and dancing, rehearsing for the party. The boy's party. We were playing with our knives and I died. I don't remember you. Who are you? Am I dead? I'm Anthony and you, who can speak now, are alive. Anthony? I'm Thomas. - Thomas? You must believe me, Thomas. There are certain things we shouldn't try to understand. They come to pass and we must believe in them. The fire of the Spirit is a mystery we will never understand, but we must let it burn freely within us. When It takes hold of a soul, It fills it with Itself. And transforms it into the flame that will be passed on to others. So I should believe a lie? I know that I'm dead. It's a lie only to you. To everyone else, you are alive. You never died. But it hurts. Why me? Why not my brother, who was just like me, and who also died? I would give my own life to bring Jesus back. Why do you have my brother's knife? Calm down, Thomas. Put the knife down. You killed my brother. Jesus was my other half. And I'm half of nothing now. This whistle belongs to my brother. Look at my fingers. I am no longer the man I used to be. I came here to right this wrong. You are free, I am free And there's a night to spend So why not spend it together? Why not take part In the adventure of our senses? You are lonely and I am lonelier You always hold my gaze Take my open hand It's waiting to close Upon your empty hand Come, for love is not time Nor is it time that makes it Come, for love is this time When I give myself When you give yourself You are looking for company I'm looking for someone Who will be the goal of this energy Be a body of pleasure Be the end of yet another day You keep waiting For the best that will not come Hope was found By another before you And I am better than nothing Come, for love is not time Nor is it time that makes it Come, for love is this time When I give myself When you give yourself...
