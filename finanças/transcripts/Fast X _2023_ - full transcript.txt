There is nothing a father wouldn't do for his son. Your mother never understood this. She looked at you and saw a monster. I saw potential. When a bully took your money, you took his eye. When they called you crazy, you took their tongues. But I brought you here today. Was it generosity? Love? No. It's so what I built doesn't die with me. So my legacy can live on, because a father and his son is everything. I have a job that I can only trust with one man. You. My most ruthless soldiers were watching our cash houses, and they let this Dominic Toretto burn what is mine. I'll kill Dominic Toretto. I'll kill 'em all. Kill them? You'd show them mercy? No, my son. When suffering is owed, never accept death as a payment. Make Toretto suffer. Now the work begins. And in there, today we'll put our family on a path to real power. Let's get started.

I need details. Yeah, the agency got a tip on some stolen military hardware. Tomorrow, a next-gen quantum computer chip will be transported through the streets of Rome, and they need us to steal it. I checked Roman's intel. It's legit. Of course it's legit. We're talking 'bout Rome. Rome. Roman. Come on, man. That's like planning a heist in my backyard.

I mean, that's the whole point, isn't it? Pass it down. Each generation better than the last. That's true. That's fatherhood.

What do you mean, "What happens if it goes off?" The Seven Hills of Rome will be down to two and a half! City-wide devastation, countless lives lost. You know, the thing bombs do. We're coming to you. All right, dorks. What are we blowing up? What? The Vatican? Wow. Okay. I'll do it. But you guys are going to hell. That's their truck. Oh, thank God. Dom, Letty. Ooh. Look who's here. You're right on time, Dominic. Turn off the encrypted radio. Ramsey? We're being remote-controlled. There's a bomb on board. It's a DM-79 subnautical high-yield neutron mine. Ah! Found it. I can disarm it with an agency kill switch. I just need physical hands on the device. - We have to stop that truck. - Sorry, Captain America. Can't let you do that. We got to hurry! The truck is speeding up. - We got to block its path. - I'm gonna get ahead of it. Ramsey, Tej, strap in. Whoop. Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Dom, go ahead! I'm pinched! Dominic. Come on! Damn it, he's fast.

Remember, I still have your families, so don't go anywhere. Buongiorno, Roma! All right. Man, who the hell is that? Hey! There he is! Man of the hour. Roman Pearce, team leader.

I can lock on to your location and transmit cellular interference through your phone. That should jam his detonator and buy us some time. Letty. Bravo! It's getting tricky, guys. I can't stay on him for much longer. Ramsey, how deep is that river? The Tiber? Uh... Uh, 60 feet. I mean, the water could smother the explosion, reduce its power by ten times, maybe. Damn it! You missed me by that much, baby! I lost him. He's gone. Damn! He's out of our reach. We can't jam the signal anymore. Bad news, Dom. I'm back in business. You got 30 seconds to save Rome.

Five. Four. Three. Two. One. What have we done? Through your suffering, I'll fulfill my destiny. Come find me. Your pain has just begun. I'll see you soon, Dom. Breaking news from Italy. The capital Rome has been hit by a massive explosion. To be a large military weapon. The Vatican has sustained some structural damage. But no lives were claimed. Authorities have identified the terrorists as - these five individuals. As these five individuals, led by this man. - Dominic Toretto. - Toretto. -Toretto. - Dominic Toretto. Dominic Toretto. Law enforcement is working across borders, mobilizing an international fugitive hunt - of unprecedented scale. I'm sorry, sir. - I don't know how she got in. - I do. I stole your badge. I'm done with it now, though. Thanks. Well, if it isn't, um... Honestly, I-I don't know what to call you. Little Miss Nobody? How about you call me by my actual name? Last I heard, Tess, you were running ops in Damascus. You think you can walk in this room just 'cause your daddy's an agency legend? I'm here because someone needs to speak on behalf of the defense. What just happened in Rome was an unmitigated disaster. Casualties were kept to a minimum, but the impact was global. And what do you think happened in Italy? Oh, sightseeing, eating bucatini, - stealing a 20-kiloton bomb. - Oh, come on, Aimes. That's bullshit and you know it. -Careful, now. With Little Nobody out of commission and your daddy in the wind, you're talking to the new boss. Showtime. Los Angeles, 2001. Humble roots, local kids, street racers who became hijackers. Graduated to high-speed smuggling, mobile jailbreaks, train robberies. If it could be done in a car, they did it. If it violates the laws of God and gravity, they did it twice. You write that yourself? We first took notice in 2011, Rio, when they robbed a drug kingpin, Hernan Reyes, left his body on a bridge. My predecessor, Mr. Nobody, saw potential, so he recruited them... Freelance, of course. They ran missions for us in Abu Dhabi, Tokyo, London, New York, Tbilisi. You ask me, we should've cut ties years back, but they had their champions. That's their M.O. To corrupt law enforcement. Brian O'Conner. Elena Neves. Luke Hobbs. Everyone becomes family. It's like a cult with cars. Even Tess's dear old dad. So we're all just a barbecue and a beer away from corruption? What's your point? Point is they're criminals. Rome was a matter of time. They've stolen hundreds of millions of dollars and at least one nuclear sub. The real question is: How did we let this go on so long? This family has gotten their hands dirty to keep ours clean. They've driven to the gates of hell and back for this agency. Something is not right with Rome. It can't be. It can and it is. The agency is better than this. We are smarter than this. We should be standing with Dom and his family. That is the very least that we can do. If we don't act, this blows back on all of us. The fallout will be existential. I'm asking for full green-light authority. Kill or capture the Toretto clan by any means. Aimes, what are you doing? Looks like the ayes have it. As your direct superior, I don't give a shit about anybody's heart of gold, and I hate barbecues. You know I'd make a freight train take a dirt road, so do not get in my way. Okay.

Are you gonna save her? - Or are you gonna save him? - Let's go, baby! This race is mine! Eeny, meeny, miny... Looks like you made your choice. Finally! Whoo! Oh, no, Diogo! Trick question. Everyone dies. And one, two, three. - Boom! Yeah! Yeah! I win, baby! Keep coming, Dom! There's so much more fun to be had! Come on. Good morning, sunshine. Goddamn it. And then he was like, "Boom!" And I was like, "Blam!" And she was like, "What?" I was like, "Shut up." And now I'm the best racer in the world, so... Do not touch that. Let it dry. You guys look fantastic. I know the black is very slimming and very scary, but the pastels, you know, they're in season, and I feel like it tones down the masculinity a little bit, which we all need these days. Did you know... Listen to me. Did you know that I was legally dead for two minutes? Two minutes. - Bob, pay attention. And you know what I saw? Nothing. Not a goddamn thing. But I do feel like once he, uh... cracked my skull open, it just opened my mind. Yeah, that's deep, right? - You're absolutely right, Bob. We should get back to work. Such a stickler. All right. [sighs] Let's see. Should we take all their money? You. You are evil. - Thank you for listening. So, mi casa, su casa. Let these dry, finish those mojitos, and, um, someone's gonna come and bury you guys soon.

All right. Whoa. Cool. What is that? That's a technical tool kit. Don't worry, it's just a bunch of awesome stuff that you're never gonna get to use. - Okay. Eyes open. Hold still. Don't smile like that. - It's unsettling. Sweet. Your new name is Chester... Chester? -...and you're on a kayaking trip with - your handsome, ripped Uncle Roger. All right. Now, time to get you some new clothes. You know, something a little more chic than pj pants, all right? - From a gas station? - From a gas station. See, I just don't understand. Why would the agency turn they backs on us, after all we've done for them? That madman pinned it all on us, and now we're public enemy number one. Well, Dom is gonna meet us at the rendezvous point. But in the meantime, we have to stay under the radar. And we got to get ready to fight. Wait, so we need guns, artillery, tanks? Yeah, but how are we gonna get that with no money? What? - We've been hacked. Look. Every account. Every dollar we made over the last 20 years is gone. He took everything. We got heisted during our own heist. - Just decrypt the... Yeah. - Decrypt the blockchain. I'm on it. Then we can find the transaction hash. The transaction hash. Gets us the receiving IPs. Exactly. English. Following our money, genius. We're trying to see where he sent it. The coding is next-level. I've never seen anything like this. We need more computing power. How are we gonna do that if we broke? What do you mean, "we" broke? Wait, you holding out on us? No wonder you've been so calm. Bro, what-what d... What do you think this is, bro? You know what? Turn around. "Turn around"? What do you... What you mean, "turn around"? Man, I'm a grown-ass... - What... N... What are you doing? Hey, Roman, do not. Please tell me you're not wearing Spanx. Oh, this ain't Spanx. These banks. But it's okay, bro. I got you. All right? You know what I mean? Yeah. That's for you. That's for you. Let me see. Han, you always good for the bag, 'cause the bag always come back, you know. So what I need from all of y'all, I need receipts. Who is you talking to? Got your receipt. So where do we go to shop off the grid? I know a place. Wait. The agency's after us. Aren't they gonna see our faces? Yeah, I'm counting on it. The first rule of tradecraft: you can't lose a tail if they don't find you. - Oh, sorry. - Sorry. I'll just... Wait. You know what, I'm just... We'll just... If you want to, uh, go. Uh, we'll stay here. - You guys, you guys go around. - Go around? Great. Go around. Sir, we just got a hit on the boy and his uncle. The rest of the team is still in Europe. We're interfacing with local authorities. Forget authorities. These people have been outrunning the cops since they could reach the gas pedal. Get word to every snitch, smuggler, hitter and hacker we've ever used. Money talks and so will they. - We're getting an alert on Black Site A. Tess just visited Ortiz. They have a nice chat? Guess not. Run it back for me. Stop. Zoom in. Back-trace her flight path. Find out where she was before this. That's where Dom is. You knew who I was all along, didn't you? From the moment I saw you. Your sister smiled with her eyes and led with her heart. Just like you do. We were nothing alike. She was the good sister. Always putting others first. Always doing what was right. Sometimes I would think that the wrong sister died. Why the good one and not me? You're wrong about not being anything like her. You think that's what she wants to hear? A cop and a street racer. I'll tell you something. They travel down the same road long enough... and they realize how much alike they really are. Trust me... I know. She's still doing it, isn't she? She's still helping people. She's helping us. You know, Elena, she knew everything about the Reyes family. After they killed her husband, she dedicated her life trying to take them down. I think I still have her files. Wait, so we gonna find military-grade gear in the middle of London? You said you wanted to shop off the grid. Wait a second. Did we just time-travel? Would you look for a black-market operation in a place like this? You've got mail. - Ooh, snacks. - Get me a receipt, homey. How am I gonna get a receipt from a vending machine? How about you figure it out? Paper trail, bruh. For tax write-off. I swear to God... What's up, Bowie420? Oh, shit. FreddieMerc? What? I had a life before you knew me. Bowie here runs one of the most notorious online black markets. If you want it, he'll sell it. I thought you didn't like that about me, though. Well, desperate times. What kind of muffins are these? Oh, those are fun muffins. You have like four of them, you'll be in your underwear watching Fantasia. Is that what you guys came for? My muffins? Oh, it's gonna be a muffin party? We, uh, we need transport. Weapons, cars, the works. And quietly. Cool, then I'm just gonna need cash. Okay? None of that crypto stuff. Oh, the Black Jeff Bezos here got you covered. Black Bezos? -Yeah, he's even been into outer space. Wow. -If y'all was gonna be giving out my money, I'd appreciate some type of a heads-up, you know what I'm saying? How much we talking about, bruh? Just like a reasonable amount. How about that? That won't even cover the muffins. Is this guy serious? Shit's crazy. Mm-kay. Come on, man, you're an astronaut. Well, how about that? What, did you leave all your money in space? Man, give me this. - Thank you. - Are you serious right now? You know I pay for everything around here, right? You should pay for everything. It's your mission in Rome that got us here in the first place. No, it was your intel that led us to Rome. To be fair, that setup would have confused the best of us. No, I'm tired of this. 'Cause all he do is talk. And then everyone has to do their job and yours. What are you saying, Tej? - Mean, what I'm saying? Hey, guys. - This is a family environment. - What? Really? - Really? Take it outside, fellas. So, what we doing, bruh? Uh-oh. - Gentlemen, please! Guys! Oh, not the vending machine. No. -WOMAN: Unbelievable. Guys, you're causing like dozens of dollars in damage! Let's go. Come on. Should we stop this? Hold on! - Nah, let 'em bond. Hey! That computer's from, like, '98! Huh? BOWIE [echoing]: What the hell, man? Okay. All right. We doing stomachs now. All right, all right, that's enough. You've been wanting that for years! -BOWIE: Uh, I think he hit the copy machine so hard it works now. What the hell was that? He's like a ghetto magician. You know what it is, bruh. - I beat your ass. - You just beat my ass? - Beat my ass, huh? - My God, will you two just quit it? Please. We don't have time for this. You. - Get to work. - Oh, I just need to hack into the marketplace. It'll just take a second. Oops. What the hell, Bowie? What did you just do? I'm sorry. Your guys's faces are, like, all over the dark web. I mean, that reward is dope. - Ow. Hey. - We have to move. - The agency's minutes away. - Look, it's nothing personal. - Hey, fun muffins on me, okay? - What? Huh? - Oh! Oh! I deserved that. - Are you okay, bro? - Yeah, thank you, man. All right, so where to now, huh? - Jail? I know somewhere. Last place I want to go. How does it feel to be on my side of the law? They like to fix things before they break 'em. It's a sick place, Letty. You're welcome. What did you do? I rerouted anesthetic gas into their air conditioning. And I bought us a few minutes before these cameras reset and they find out this place turned into a sleep study. You gonna stay grumpy or do you want to get out of here? They're not gonna sleep forever. Don't you want to get back to your precious family? Shit. Seems like you got this covered. - What do you need me for? - I have a plan, but it's a two-person job. Now, was that so hard? How much time do we have? I'd say about four minutes. It'll have to do. ♪ Then I ball like Spalding ♪ Can't call my bluff when the... is my calling... ♪ ♪ I got 'em going crazy ♪ Huh! I'd stay down if I was you. You got to hit me harder for that.

Dante Reyes. Born in Portugal. Mother from the Pacific Islands. Sociopathic tendencies from an early age. He bounced from juvie to prison to mental wards. And each time, Daddy was there to spring him out. After his father died, he disappeared. Properties Reyes owned before he died. Now all sold and repo'd. Except this one. The police station. It's been abandoned for years. And guess whose name is on the deed. Dante Reyes. I'll find my answer there. I'm coming with you. I need you to stay safe. I would have won that race, you know. So you want a rematch? - I'm demanding it. So I guess I'll see you soon. Guys, you don't want to do this. He needs a new watch, cop. Look, the watch was a gift. But I got 16 carats of uncut diamonds in my jockstrap if you want to take a look. Now you really do need a new watch. Damn it. B, you okay? Tried gum? Gum helps. I don't like planes. If it's the height, that's gonna be an issue. You know, I used to be scared of cars. After my dad died, I guess I blamed myself. It was tough. I had panic attacks, the whole bit. Heck, I took the bus. Yeah. I think I was just so worried about making mistakes and not being as good as my brother. - You? - Uh, excuse me. Have you met your dad? He casts a pretty big shadow. Huh. Feeling better? - Yeah. - Good. Me, too. Here's the drink that you ordered, sir. You know her? Yeah, it's good to have friends in high places. On the count of three, we're gonna get up and go to the bathroom. Ready? - Three. Who were those guys? Agency. They found us. Now let's lose our tail. Holy shi... Wait! Swearing is for song lyrics only and stubbed toes. Forget about it. Pay attention. Okay? We're-we're too high to glide, so we need thrust, which means, uh, combustion, which means...? Oxygen and fuel. Alcohol. - Um... - Huh? Oh. That's rosé. Not gonna work. Long story. But good initiative. I'm glad it wasn't the height. Enjoy the ride, Little B. Bowie tagged us. The agency is on our tail. We need to find gear and get to the rendezvous as soon as possible. It's right here. You guys hold back. Let me take care of this. No, no, no. Th-That's a bad idea. - I mean like Roman-level bad. - What? What are you talking about, man? You heard what I said. Look, bro, you don't have to do this, man. You know I got your back. We got your back. - I got to do this alone. I have something to talk to you about. The only reason a dead guy shows up at my door: revenge. Oh, shi... - Oh, shit. - Shit. Han! Should have stayed dead. I can get in. I can get in. I don't like repeating myself. You ruined my snacks. Relax. I don't want to fight you. Then this is gonna end quick. You bring more men to kill me? They're trying to kill me, too. Well, it looks like we got more company. - You still drive? - What do you think? Okay, just give me a second. Freeze! - Drop the laptop! - Okay. - Guys, I'm in. No, no, no, no! Now we're even. You okay? Now, see, I understand all this. What the hell was that? You got scared. I saw that. - Ain't nobody got scared, bruh. - No, you were... he was scared. LETTY [over speakers]: We have an unwanted guest. DOM [over speakers]: My family? They're safe for now. You're not afraid of anything. I don't care about dying. I only care about protecting the people that I love. Hold us in your heart and you will never lose your way. You're not afraid of anything. Fear can be a great teacher. LITTLE BRIAN [distorted]: You're not afraid of anything. DANTE [over phone]: How do you like my place? I'm bummed I'm not there to show you around. And a little embarrassed you saw my vision board. But at least you know how hard I've been working to get us to this point. Now I know you're a dead man. You mean resurrected. Thanks to you. You know, if you never would have gotten behind that wheel, I'd never be the man that I am today. You built such a beautiful life, filled with love and family. I never got that chance. Collateral damage, chaos, death. This is your legacy. I'm your legacy. You know what I can't figure out? How someone born so rich chooses the poorest path through life. You got no honor. Without honor, you got no family. And without family... you've got nothing. I have nothing because of you. My future. My family. You stole that from me. And now I'm gonna break yours, piece by piece. Stop talking and face me. Do you like surprises, Dommy? I adore them. But the game's not over yet. There's still so many people to hurt. I'm coming for you. Well, that's gonna be hard to do in handcuffs. Okay, bye, Dommy. No, you hang up first. Okay. Toretto, freeze. Time to face the music, Dom. You're playing right into his hands, cop. Okay. Come on. Oh. Yeah. Great. Just great. Shit. Little chilly? Your plan still sucks. Maybe, but at least you'll be warm. "Thank you, Cipher. Thank you." - Oh, wow. Take a look at this. This should cover us in the gear department. You are not to be trusted. Hey, you ain't on my Christmas list either. Nothing here is for free. Let me be clear on that. Make sure you get a receipt from him, okay? I'd love to see that. Well, I guess Bowie wasn't entirely worthless. I can use his hard drive to complete our trace of Dante. He's been ten moves ahead of us this whole time. How does he do it by himself? Uh, this isn't good. Our money, it's been split into accounts all over the world. And look who they're registered to. Those are mercenary kill teams. Real scum. He used our money to buy an army. So this guy doesn't just want us dead. He wants to erase us off the planet. He's trying to tear us apart. That's exactly why we need to link back up with Dom at the rendezvous point. You need to see this. They've been paid to target us and anyone who ever helped us until now. Mum. I'll have transport waiting for you. And where are you going? I'm gonna dig some graves. Mr. Nobody's golden boy, caught without so much as a fight. That's no fun. It's like going all the way to Everest and taking the elevator. You might want to buckle up. I know you did some good work for the agency. I'm sure you figured that buys you some leniency. But it's a new day. That's the problem nowadays. Nobody listens. You should have spent less time with your head under the hood and more time preparing for what's coming. Spies have been replaced by satellites, fighter pilots by drones, intelligence by an algorithm. The days where one man behind the wheel of a car can make a difference are over, Dom. Hell, the days of any man behind the wheel of a car are over. What are you doing? Preparing for what's to come. Right. Go. Go. Go. Dominic, I brought you back to where we first met. And I have a surprise for you. Dom! I'm listening now. Dominic? Dominic! Would you stop hurting my new friends? No. I'm only here to hurt you. Oh. I'm not gonna lie to you. That little car stunt you just did? That was pretty awesome. Wasn't it? It was so cool. But if you don't stop, I'm gonna cut her everywhere. Badly. There she is. - Hmm. - Fashionably late. You got me. Mmm. - Off you go. Family. Will you please get off my car? - Hmm. That is so disrespectful. You talk too much. Stop, stop! You don't know your own strength. You butthole! Oh, hey. Do you like ballet? I adore Swan Lake. I feel like you're more of a... Kind of a Nutcracker guy. And a one, and a two, and... No! Wait for it. Oh, no. She's in peril. What will you do? You know what your problem is? Family. You can't save 'em all. Five. Four. Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta. Go on. Two. You don't like ballet. I can feel it. May I please have the God's Eye? - Screw you. - No? Pretty please? - Oh, there it is. Ooh. Gotcha. Good trade. Keep the car. Oh, Dommy! I told you, you owe me suffering! Your legacy isn't money or power or the family you built or the life you led. It's the life you made. And a father and his son... is everything. You killed my father on this bridge. And now I know where to find your son. Enchanté. You're gonna be okay, Tess. It went clear through. Kinda hurts. Your father would be proud. Yeah. You will stop him. Have faith. She needs a hospital. Mm. You're gonna be okay. I got her. Go save your son. My nephew. I'm not gonna say I'm sorry, so let me do you one better.

You know your dad. He's got to make it safe. We'll just wait. I love you, Uncle Jakob. What's that? That? Ah, project I've been working on. You wouldn't be interested. All right, we're entering Portuguese airspace. Jakob's already there. Any word from Dom? Hey. Why are you so quiet? You all right? Just been sitting here thinking, man. I knew I smelled something burning in here. Tej, it was my mission, y'all took my lead, and I messed this thing up every step of the way. I guess this whole... leadership thing really ain't for me. You took us to London on a container. You spent thousands of dollars of your own cash, strapped to your ass, that now smells like cheap cologne. Now you're sitting here taking sole responsibility for something that we all wear. Yeah, I know. It sounds stupid. Nah, it don't sound stupid at all. You know what it sounds like to me? That sounds like a leader. Come on, man. Get your ass up, man. I love you, man. I love you, too, bro. Sometimes we got to say, "I'm sorry." I'm sorry for whupping your ass, man, 'cause I didn't really mean to do that. The whole thing, it would've been a whole dif... - - You okay? What's wrong? I'm just allergic to your bullshit. - Come on. Hey, go easy there. You're gonna break that thing. - You all right? God's Eye was just used to send dozens of mercenaries after Dom's son. Something I created hurting the people we love. It was meant to help. This is bigger than just Dante. This is bigger than just us. We have to stop this monster now. We got to go. Hold on! I got eyes on Uncle Muscle and the kid. All right, everybody, remember the plan. Contain and kidnap. Thank you. No. No guns. I need this little shit alive. At least for a while. - You ready? - Ready. Holy sh... Oh, no, you're good. You're good. Okay, uh, song lyrics, stubbed toes and cannon cars. Yeah. Here we go! It's stuck. It's stuck. They got an army down there, Dom. Your team's not far out. - Bring us down. - I can't put her down here. There's an airfield seven klicks west. Okay, we'll meet you there. Now open the back. Dom, there's really nowhere to land. Who said anything about landing? Look. I'm coming for you, son. What the... - Dad! - Hey, son. Good to see you, big bro. Good to see you guys. Follow me to that plane. We're right behind you. I got you now. Aimes, we're on our way. Dom, I'll be touching down five klicks west. But they're still on your tail. It's jammed. B, what are you doing? Careful. Okay, okay, okay. Shut the front door. Little B. Uncle Jakob! I fixed it! B! Toodle-oo. - Help! - Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta. Shut up. Damn it. You party? I party. - Whoa. Dom, I lost him. Dante has Little B. Hey, Dominic. Welcome to the big showdown. It's the last lap. Check out my copilot. - Dad! - Who could've seen this coming? I mean, you know, except for me. Shit. Looks like my fuel line's been shot. - I can't get to him, Dom. - Jakob, stay with me. I'm out of this race. It has to be you. Hey, Dom! Got a little surprise for you. You raised a hell of a son, Dom. Time for me to step out from under your shadow. Thanks for showing me the light. Jakob? I'm gonna go clear the way. Go get your son. Jakob, don't! - Don't! Uncle Jakob! Looks like Uncle Muscle won't be coming to the next barbecue. Oh. I mean, it's very honorable. Three miles away. Take the service road. It'll lead you right to the airfield. You know how to beat your dad in a street race? Take away the streets. - Dad! Amazing. Oh. We got it. We got it. My turn. He's good. Your dad's good. Dom, you got one mile left. Son, I never break a promise. Now, let's finish that driving lesson. Feel the car, find your line and fly. - Oh! - Now! No. Take the service road now. - I'm wheels down. - We're headed to you now. Your team is on their way. I'll meet you at the airfield. - You okay? - I'm good, Dad. I'm real proud of you, son. Oh, Dommy boy. It's so good to see you again. Did you hit me with a helicopter back there? Hmm. Ow, you big brute. I mean, I get it. You're showing off in front of your son. But honestly, did you really think it was going to be that easy? You're exactly where I wanted you to be. Yes. Wait for it. I got a surprise for you. The cavalry's here. We got you, Dom. Roman, get out of here. It's a trap. Incoming! Yes! See, that's the problem with having a big family. Can't protect 'em all. Ooh! Oh, Dominic, is that your new friend? Aw. You are so predictable. You think everyone's gonna end up on your side? Problem is Aimes was mine first. Now the work begins. And in there, today we'll put our family on a path to real power. Let's get started. Well, looks like our partnership's off to a fantastic start. You know, Dominic, to become a real saint, you have to perform miracles. Or die a martyr. So what's it gonna be? I took your money, I took your freedom, and I'm gonna take your family. And you're gonna die knowing that you couldn't save your son. Dad. I have faith. You made one mistake. You never took my car. Oh! The suffering is over, Dom. It's time for you to die. No way.
