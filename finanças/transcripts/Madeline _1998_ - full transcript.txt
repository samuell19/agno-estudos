Madeline! Gotcha. In an old house in Paris that was covered in vines, lived 12 little girls... in two straight lines. In two straight lines, they broke their bread... And brushed their teeth... and went to bed. They smiled at the good... And frowned at the bad. And sometimes they were very sad. They left the house at half past 9, in two straight lines, in rain... or shine. The smallest one was Madeline. Eh, what do you think? It's great. You've really captured it. Madeline! Au revoir. The circus is coming! Come one, come all! See the Idiot Popopov. Experience the depth of terror... at the sight of the man-eating tiger! To the tiger in the zoo, Madeline just said... Poo, poo. And nobody knew so well how to frighten Miss Clavel. Madeline! Get down! Take that! Bless Lady Covington... and protect her that she may recover quickly. And bless this food we are about to receive... to our use... Merde. And us to Thy service. Amen. Amen. Voila. Chicken Helene. Yea! Vite, vite. Good night, little girls. Thank the Lord you are well. And now go to sleep. Good night, good night, Miss Clavel. Elizabeth, Veronica, Sylvette, Marie-Odile, Serena, Beatrice, Lucinda, Chantal, Lolo, Victoria, Aggie and Madeline. Especially Madeline. Amen. Something is not... right. Ooh. Madeline's burning up, Miss Clavel! Should we call the fire department? No, Chantal, "burning up" is a metaphor. - Like "Chantal is thick. - As a plank." Victoria. No, that's a simile. Go get Helene, now. Ooh, my tummy. She must have eaten something super horrid. We all ate the same thing. That means we're all gonna die. Girls, that's enough. Helene, telephonez a I'hopital. Oui. Shh. [EXCITED CHATTERING My hat! Where's my hat? Girls, find. Madeline's hat! Upstairs, upstairs. Vite, vite! Oui, madame, oui. Where is it? Think like a hat. I'm a hat. I'm a hat. I'm a hat. I'm a hat! Voila! Hurry up! Come on, everybody. We found it! A bientot. Miss Clavel! Hold it very tightly. That's good. S'il vous plait. I think they'll have to take out her appendix. My appendix? No, you'll be fine. She'll be fine! Repeat after me, Madeline: "I can do anything." I can do anything. I can do anything. I can do anything. - Our patient from here on. - I'm sorry. But I must stay with her. Wait. Miss Clavel, please! I'll be right outside. I can do anything. I can do... Ow! Ow! Are you her mother? Uh, no, no, I'm not. I'm her teacher. And where are her parents? - She's a ward of the church. - She has no parents. - They died. - When she was very small. Oh. Here. I can do anything. We won't be visiting for long today. It's only been a few days since the operation, and Madeline will be... exhausted. We must be gentle with her. Shh. Hi, everybody! You're okay. Girls, your flowers. She's got as many toys as you do. Yes, but these aren't hers. They're for charity cases. Look! It's a crank! We were super, super worried. Was it scary? Did you see a white light? They cut a three-inch hole in me. Then they stuck their bare hands in and pulled out some of my guts. You're so lucky. Please. Madeline. All right, I was asleep. So basically, all you did was take a long nap. Wait. I haven't shown you the best part yet. Look. Come over here. Come and look. Look what they gave me in exchange for my appendix. Ohh! It's not that big. Are you kidding? It's huge. It's "gi-normous"! All right, girls. We'll say our good-byes now. Madeline's had a hectic and sleepless evening. She's emotionally drained and needs her rest. Bye, Madeline! We'll come and see you soon. Bye, Aggie. Bye, Miss Clavel. Can we visit Lady Covington? Not today, Aggie. Please report to surgery in room 24 immediately. Lady Covington. Hi there, Madeline. You remember me? Of course I remember you. From my visit last Easter. Yes. Come in. I heard one of our girls was in this hospital. Are you feeling better? Yes, ma'am. I hope... they are giving you a lot of ice cream. They are. I hope they're giving you lots of ice cream as well. Not much. Are you feeling better? Much better. You know, Madeline, my grandmother started the school, and I was a student there myself when I was a little girl. Can I tell you a secret? Yes. When I was nine, on the baseboard in the dortoir, I carved my name. You carved Lady Covington? No. No, my name was Marie Gilbert. Marie Gilbert. See if it's still there. Marie Gilbert. Who gave you permission To be in here? N-Nobody. Lord, um, Covington. This is a hospital. It's not a playroom. You're not allowed to just wander around. Yes, sir. Something is not right. What? What is it? We want our appendix out too! Good night, little girls. Thank the Lord you are well. Now, please, go to sleep. Good night, good night, Miss Clavel. Au revoir, Madeline. Au revoir. Wait, Miss Clavel. Um, but that's Lady Covington's room. Did she get better and go home as well? No, Madeline. Lady Covington... Lady Covington passed away. But I only just spoke to her. She was very sick. We'll miss her very much. I'm sorry. Are you all right? [HELENE COMPLAINING My first husband was a truck driver. Stupid man. What's your name? Miss Clavel. Is this a pet chicken? No, you know the rule, Madeline. No pets allowed. Then what's it for? What is it for? What do you think it's for, dancing? It's for eating. For eating? In honor of your return, we'll have Chicken Helene. Enough is enough. - Hello, street. - Hello, house. Hello, vines. Take care, Madeline. Madeline, the Spanish ambassador's moving in next door. Wait! Hat, wait! - The Spanish ambassador's. - A midget? Madeline! This is Pepito, the Spanish ambassador's son. Hola. Pepito. We're off to the races. No leaving the courtyard. Hasta luego. That boy's a bad hat. I don't think you should judge people too quickly. But I guess I understood him quickly. So you're Pepito, eh? He's positively Elvis. Don't give him any attention. He's a bad hat. But I like his hat. Madeline, you're so young. This boy's got charisma. Ugh. But is he intelligent? Who cares? He's got a motorcycle. It's a Vespa. He'll probably get run over someday. He is sort of handsome. Forget it, Aggie. You don't stand a chance. Nobody wants a chance, Vicki, except for you. "He's got charisma." You're all googly-eyed. I am not googly-eyed. He'll see us. Amen. Amen. Tonight, Madeline, I made your very favorite, Chicken Helene. Yea! It looks super. It looks great, Helene. Smells gorgeous. Oh, no. Fred. Fred? Who's Fred? That's Fred. It's a chicken. Chickens don't have names. How do you know? Madeline, aren't you hungry? I've suddenly lost my appetite. You see, this chicken was a friend of mine. I met him earlier in the car. I'm think I'm a vegetarian. This is just - too idiotic. If you knew the chicken the way I did, Vicki, you wouldn't eat him. Of course I would. He's nice and crispy, just the way I like him. Well, I'm not eating Fred. Fred's already dead. Look. Well, I think I'm a "vegetable-arian" too. I can't eat it either. What's going on? Who is Fred? I don't understand. I'm sorry, Helene, but you killed him. Fred. Well, I wasn't friends with Fred. Eat it. Eat it, Lolo. Don't be one of them. Eat it! Everyone is entitled to her opinion. If Vicki wants to eat Fred, the chicken... May I ask what's going on? Excuse us, my lord. You found us in the middle of a debate. A debate. Miss Clavel, I wonder if I might have a word with you. What's Lord Cucubutt doing here? Lord Covington. Hmm? On behalf of myself and the girls, I would like to offer you our deepest sympathy. Thank you very much, Miss Clavel. The girls. Yes, I'm afraid they lack discipline. They are usually very well-behaved, if I may say so. You may say so, but it is not my experience. I've been going through my wife's papers, putting her final affairs in order. This must be a very difficult time for you. In 43 years of marriage, the only thing that my wife and I ever disagreed upon... was her indulgence of this school. It needed a new roof, my wife wrote a check. Cook needed a new refrigerator, my wife wrote a check. Trips to the zoo. She was a wonderfully generous woman. Well, it can't go on like this. I'm closing the school down. But the... The girls. Will find another school to attend. Eating chickens is not the same as wearing leather shoes. - Yes, it is. - No, it isn't. End of debate. If you won't eat your chicken, it's off to bed with you. What did we do? No dinner at all? "Marie Gilbert." Who's that? A friend of mine. I'm super hungry. You're super everything. It's better to be super everything than super nothing. I don't think I'm super, super everything. All right. We're all hungry. So let's eat. But we're not allowed. Poo, poo. Come on, come on. I don't really think we should do this. Shh. In the French Resistance, we knew how to deal with a man like Cucuface. Oh, Helene, Don't even joke about such things. Who is joking? Shh. If they hear us, we're dead meat. But we're vegetarians. Stop whispering. You stop whispering. It's knickers. It's a bra. Booby baskets. Boobies, boobies, boobies. Pickle sandwiches. Are dairy products all right? Eww! Super bad smell! All right. Who did it? Smells like one of Vicki's. Pew. Gross. Aggie. She who smelt it dealt it. Chantal. It's not me. It's this. Nobody breathe. It's that special cheese. Close it. Give me a Jack. Go fish. Chicken Helene. Chicken. Chicken. Chicken. Je t'aime, George. [AGGIE MOANING, Now, what's for dessert? We can bake a cake. - Come back here, you. I don't. - Care who your father is. We're not in Spain! We're not gonna take this. If you think you scare me, well, you don't! And... It is an outrage. We were just going to get something to eat. It's all Pepito's fault. - Who's going to. - Clean up this mess? We are, Miss Clavel. And then what do you suggest? We eat. Shh! Helene? All right. But from now on, I do the cooking, okay? Mm-hmm. Up, up, up. Hello. A nun. Leopold's the name. Tutorin's the game. I'm, um, Pepito's new tutor. I'm Miss Clavel from the school next door. Ahh. Pepito appears to be a bit of a handful. It seems to me he needs an outlet for his energy. Well, we all do, don't we? I thought he might appreciate this. It's a toolbox. Hmm. Cheers. Um, do you mind if we talk a little shop? These, um, kids... What do you actually do to keep them occupied, keep 'em out of your hair? Well, tomorrow, for instance, I'm taking mine to the museum. The museum? Not bad. What do you do on your day off? I pray. Despite being rather tiny in size, Emperor Napoleon held France in an iron grip. I don't want you to simply copy the painting. I want you to loosen up, express yourselves, go wild. You have exactly 20 minutes. Draw. Madeline, where's your drawing pad? Oops. I left it in the other gallery. I know where it is. Are you sure? Yes. Then you may go and retrieve it. Where are you going, little girl? I asked you a question. What's the matter? Scared? I wasn't scared of you, Pepito. Were you lookin' for this? That's mine! Hey, I know it's yours. You stole it. I was gonna give it back. - You should say "thank you," - don't you think? Give it to me! Oi! Keep it down. Some of us are trying to sleep. Adios, little girl. "Beware"? Beware of what? Girls. We've received an invitation from our new neighbor. "His Excellency," the Ambassador of Spain, "requests your presence" for afternoon tea... to celebrate the tenth "birthday of his son." But we can't go. The message said, "Beware." It's a trap. We'll never make it out alive. Of course we're going. We never get invited anywhere. Vicki's right. We can't let him frighten us off. It's only a boy, girls. Excuse me, Miss Clavel. - This is the room that requires. - Some attention. - May I help you, - Lord Covington? May I ask what these marks on the wall are? Those are for keeping track of the girls' heights. Huh. Paint them over. Excuse me. Excuse me. We have just begun our class. Perhaps you'd be kind enough to reconvene elsewhere, Miss Clavel. Go ahead. Downstairs, girls. In an orderly fashion. Uh, young ladies. Right. You, paint it over. Madeline. - No matter what you wear, - Vicki, You always look super gorgeous. You can wear whatever you like to the party tomorrow. I know what I'll be wearing. Don't worry, Miss Clavel. One of us will look smashing. Hmm. Serena. Look at the dress. Girls. Hello! Oh, you all look so charming. Girls. Buenas tardes, Senora y Senor. Embajador de Espana. Que lindo. Muy bien. Please come in. Slowly. Girls, girls, girls. Pepito. They're here. Ahh! Ladies. May I present the reason we have opened to you our home... Our birthday boy, Senor Jose Marco. Filippo Juan Franloco... Lopez de Vega Esteban Machado... Jorge Santiago de la Rocha... Gaspar... Carlos de Fuentes. Coruna Diego y Sevilla. Of course, his friends call him "Pepito." What friends? Senoritas, you honor me with your presence. Your limousine is waiting, sir. Do excuse us. I wish we could stay. Happy birthday. Bye-bye, darling. Do you have the tickets? Yes, darling. I think you look very handsome, Pepito. But no one told us this was a costume party. Madeline. This is not a costume. This is the uniform of a Spanish toreador. The great heroes of the coliseums... de Madrid. He's a bullfighter. Those must be some pretty small bulls. Please. You're not a real bullfighter. Senoritas, allow me to show you my menagerie. What's the matter... You damn idiot! I'll get him to the circus. That's not your concern. I don't know. You just stick with the plan, then we'll all be rich. I need to talk to my brothers about this. Look, no worries, mate. He's as good as delivered. Shh. Do you happen to know my uncle? - He's the British. - Ambassador in Madrid. No. Is there meant to be a clown at the party? The only clown here is you. Ooh. Wow! It stinks in here. What's in there, Pepito? It's a surprise. I'm not afraid of mice. No? Perhaps you're afraid of the snake... that's gonna have this mouse for lunch. You wouldn't feed a live mouse to that snake. Of course not. That would be cruel. But what I would do is execute him with the guillotine I built. It's quick, silent and deadly. Like Helene's cheese. It's just an innocent, little mouse! Hey! I'll show you! Let it go! Girls? Girls? Mon Dieu! You big idiot! Miss Clavel. - Look. - Ohh! I'll get you! You're choking me. Stop it this instant! I'll get you! If you can't behave, we're leaving. Now. Girls. What about the cake? There's only 197. Begin again. Thanks a lot, Madeline. I've never been so humiliated. Can you believe them? And that poor carrot. Trust Madeline to get us all in trouble. It was a super bad punishment. He deserved it. He was about to kill a live, baby mouse right in front of us. But he did say he was joking. Aggie. What do you think? I've been praying for inspiration. Yes, I can see that. You don't like it? Listen to me. Madeline. It's not my fault that boy's a bad hat. How can you take his side? Have you all gone mad? I did the right thing. The boy kills bulls. He kills mice. He's a maniac. Very interesting. I'll show that bullfighter, that mouse killer. I'll fight him myself! - Yes, Aggie. - Take that, Pepito, and that! No! Aah! Madeline! Madeline! Look! Somebody help her. Help! The current is taking her across the bridge. Madeline! Keep your head up! Help! Madeline! Madeline! Where is she? Help! Help. Help! Madeline! Madeline! Follow me. Girls, quickly. Help! Help! Not too fast. Help! Help! - Madeline! - There's a dog! Look at the dog! Help! Stop! Stop. Thank you. Oh, Madeline! Hold on tight. Yea! The dog. Where's the dog? Are you all right? Are you all right? I'm fine. I'm fine. I was so scared. Tea, soup and covers. I want you to stay under the covers, eat your soup and drink your tea. You're giving me - gray hair. Can I see? No. Stay in bed. Bye, Madeline. Bye. Bye. Miss Clavel, can I stay home tomorrow? I'm feeling sick. No, Aggie. Please? Leopold, where are my keys? Leopold! Could you please find my keys? All right. Pipe down. Could you find my keys or not? You don't need a bloody key. You can use a paper clip. Oh, yeah, right. Watch. Hey, hey. It worked. Whoo! Yeah. Whoo-hoo! You found me. Genevieve. Genevieve. You found me. I never thought you would. Thank you. Thank you. - I think you'll find. - It's in immaculate condition. The house was built in 1852. It's charming, isn't it? The property's been in my wife's family for generations. What a place to invite your guests. You don't have any children? No, no, no. Just the two of us. Let's start in the dining room, if you'll follow me. The house has been used for the past few decades as a school for girls. Hence, the sensible furniture. What a spacious dining room. Oh, such a beautiful portrait. Is that your wife? It's my late wife, yes. She was very lovely. Yes, indeed, she was. Shall we go and have a look at the kitchen? It has all the modern conveniences. Kitchens are my staff's Business. I never set foot in it. Just reassure me that you have one. We have one. This room speaks for itself. The music room. I think you'll agree it has an air of real sophistication. Mmm. Splendid. So, upstairs? Oh. Have a look at these doors. Solid oak. They don't make them like this anymore. And so, we arrive at yet another room... with the most elegant proportions. Think how splendid it will be to see the Liberian flag... fluttering out of that window. Indeed. Well, I see nothing to prevent us from purchasing this magnificent house. Did you hear something just now? No, I can assure you, the neighborhood is uniquely peaceful. What is that sound? Ole, ole! That boy down there. Arriba, arriba. Andale. The Spanish ambassador's son. We had a terrible little boy next door to us in Ouagadougou. The worst three years of my life. He never slept, not ever. I'm sorry. This just won't work. I should warn you that I've had inquiries from a number - of other foreign diplomats. - Never again! - The Indians will. - Be here tomorrow. - Under no circumstances. - Never again. I'll get rid of the boy. He's a pest. I'll speak to the Spanish governor. Did you know that Joan of Arc was burnt at the stake when she was only 19? Girls. Vite, vite. Now go to bed. Listen, everybody. I've something to tell you. I'm gonna be burnt at the stake too, someday. What a neat way to die. You're all nuts. - Yeah, cashews. - Bless you. No, really. This is a big secret. The dog from the river. I told you we should've stayed. She's cute. I'll give her my bone. So this is the big secret. No, this is not about Genevieve. Great name. We'll never be able to keep her. Something is not right. Vite, vite! Thank you for finding her. What's going on, girls? Nothing! We're not hiding anything. I'll tell you what's going on. Lord Cucuface... Covington. Cucuface. He's going to sell the school. I heard it. Oh, no! Is it true? Yes, girls. Lord Covington intends to sell the school. That's terrible. He can't. Please. Please. Please. All of this is no reason... for us to stop acting like proper young ladies. We will not fall to pieces. We will maintain composure. Lord Covington is showing the house tomorrow, and I intend for it to be spo... Spotle... Spotless. Bless you. Thank you. Good night. And another thing. All of you young - ladies know There is a strict rule against pets in the school. What you do not know is that I am highly allergic to dogs. Your new friend can sleep in the garden shed. Thanks. Now go to... Bed. I can't believe she let us keep her. She's just a dog from the streets. It's a beautiful dog. Ahh. I can't believe they're closing the school. We'll never see each other again. It's not fair. Close the school. That Cucuface is super wicked. Chantal, what are you doing? - Trying to find. - Some way out of this. You only just found out how to tie your shoelaces. I think we're all being terribly selfish. Just think of poor, pathetic Madeline. Mm-hmm. She doesn't have any family at all. Yeah, think of Madeline. I can't believe she just said that. She's not pathetic. I'm sure you'll find someplace to stay, Madeline. I'm staying right here. We all are. You three on construction. Aggie, you and Chantal cover the kitchen. And you two on dog patrol. And the rest of you, fall out. And I'll negotiate with Spain. Hurry up. Hurry up. Yes, Vicki. Come on, Genevieve. A bientot. Bye-bye. Mmm. Pepito! Pepito! You want me to go and break it up? No, no. Look. That boy is simply misunderstood. The property's been in my late wife's family for generations. The house has been used for the past few decades as a school for girls. Say hello to. Lord Covington, girls. Good morning, Lord Covington. Young ladies. Miss Clavel. Charming. ♪ Hear the song Of the nightingale ♪ ♪ Singing beautifully ♪ ♪ Everyone who listens To her song ♪ ♪ Sings along ♪ Think how lovely it will be to have the Indian flag fluttering on the lawn.

No, please, please! Reconsider! Aaah! Ohh. The Uzbekistani Ambassador will be arriving soon. I know he means business. Please reconsider! We did it. We did it! Everybody was like... Ah! What exactly did you say to. Pepito this morning, Madeline? All I said was that we were having some very important guests this morning, so could you pretty please be very quiet at that time? [RADIO PLAYING UPBEAT Wait! Stop the car. If I may say so, your little boy is a menace. Your Excellency. I want an explanation. Why did this loco fellow say our Pepito is a menace? I have no idea. Pepito is a sweet, well-behaved child. Th-There's just, eh, one problem with Pepito. What is that? Well, he needs some diversion. He spends all day cooped up in the house, studying. I'm teaching him Latin. I'm teaching him biology, "algebration," "calculometry," "physiconomy" and, eh, astrology. But he can hardly read. Nah, he's taken huge leaps. Oh, wonderful. So, um, as a reward for all his hard work, - I'm gonna take him. - To the circus. The circus? The circus? I love the circus! We'll all go to the circus. A great idea. We will all go.
