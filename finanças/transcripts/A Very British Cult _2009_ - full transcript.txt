This programme contains some strong language So why did you get in touch? Someone said the line, "If you really want to get to the bottom of something... LAUGHING: "..contact a journalist, "not the police." We've had private investigator reports... There's been so much work done on this organisation and... ..you can only ever go so far. So what did she say? So she says that her boyfriend is in a cult. But it's not like any cult I've ever heard of. I had had these ambitions to do something. I've always wanted to build business or be inspiring or do something good in life. What is Lighthouse? Lighthouse? It's life coaching. It's a pioneering mentoring organisation. He had this mentor... We exist to help people to develop themselves... I'm thinking, "I can achieve something here." It was brilliant. Phone calls. All day, every day. And then that's when I started worrying. I started to feel as though I couldn't think anything unless my mentor said it's a healthy thing to think. You started becoming separated from people. They're still recruiting now. I did feel this feeling the whole time, like he was watching me. Everyone has handed over so much money. The total I invested was £131,000. I knew he was going to sell his house. ON PHONE: The people that he murdered... Yeah, yeah... It's such a strong stereotype. The only cults are in California where people wear long orange robes. There is a cult in your neighbourhood. It's as if my daughter's died. They are brainwashing people. I didn't want him to end up not being him. He told me, "Remember, we have all your secrets." Are you going to take that out or are you going to keep it in? Keep this up. Come close! ON PHONE: I'm abandoned... Wake up and smell the coffee, Jeffrey. She's not who you think she is. That's to sync the cameras up. Oh! I thought there was a fly. OK, and... Three, two, one. So how did you meet Jeff? I met Jeff on a Friday night, very drunk in the pub in Chichester. I shouldn't say this on public TV, really, but... So I thought he was just a little bit of a ruffian, and he had a squashed nose, so he looks like a boxer. You don't think it was going to be anything, and then he's... Yeah, he's completely different. He's a sailor and he's all into his adventure and I'm probably the one that's more common out of the two, really. SHE CHUCKLES How are you feeling? I'm OK, I'm a bit nervous. I grew up in Sussex. I used to have a lot of freedom. I had a lot of adventure as a kid. Yeah, we had a tight, a tight family. One of my ambitions, which I've had since a kid, was to go to the South Pole. I needed... I needed something more than just myself to... to make that happen. I needed some sort of other knowledge or some people that were successful already. Jeff's 34 and from Portsmouth. He was working as a skipper, teaching military personnel how to sail, when in late 2018, he joined an online book group looking for help in making his ambitions come true. and they're studying the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. I thought, "Well, if I can learn them, use them in my own life, "I'll do well." You had to leave your number, so a week later, I had a phone call from Jai Singh... Ah! Cool. Cool, cool, cool. Good evening. So when I first met Jeff, only within, like, a few months, he was talking about this mentor, Jai. I thought he was smart, he could speak well. So we're reading the start of habit seven, so right from the top, habit seven, Sharpen The Saw. He was interested in, you know, the same ideas that I was interested in. We read most of the book. I really enjoyed it. Saw it benefiting my life, too. That's when Jai offered me the opportunity to work with him one-on-one and have some personal mentoring. PHONE DIALS, SQUEAKY GIBBERISH It felt great - I was motivated, I was inspired, and I started working hard. I could speak better, write better. I'm more in flow. Yeah, I'm loving it. He said, "We run this discipline programme. "We found it to be the most, sort of, basic thing that anybody needs." You said it a while ago, your dream... By this stage, Jeff had been talking to Jai Singh constantly for more than six months. They were like best mates. Discipline programme was £10,000. That was going to be a year's worth of mentoring. And these calls then became more frequent, longer, more intense, more about deeper parts of your life. What sort of things were you sharing with him? HE PUFFS Loads of stuff. At first just what I was doing all day, every day, and I would share my ambitions, my desires, insecurities... If Dawn and I were having trouble, I'd share that. In time, began to share traumatic things, things I found deeply painful. So they would be on the phone for, like, four hours. He would check everything off with him, have a dispute about something, or he'd let me down and I would send him a message, upset about it. And the message I got back didn't sound like Jeff, because the language was different. They weren't messages from Jeff, they were messages from Jai. What is Lighthouse? Lighthouse was something that just sort of grew in my life. I thought it was a network of entrepreneurs. Just to give you a little bit of background on Lighthouse, we've been going for about 16 years, I've been involved for...11, I think, for my sins. We exist to help people to develop themselves so that they can improve themselves and improve the lives of others around them. Mentoring, coaching, counselling, leadership development. Yeah, so I'm Simon, and... Yeah, so I... Well... Let me.. Let's go back to the beginning. I've got so many questions still! I was going to a lot of networking events at the time. Tom kind of just came over and introduced himself. That was Tom Hasker. Ten years ago, I got involved with Lighthouse. Tom and Simon gone really well, and soon Tom was Simon's mentor. I think it really helped me to feel, like, seen and heard. It felt he was someone I could share my experiences with and my aspirations... ..for the future. Tom Hasker and Jai Singh are part of Lighthouse, a mentoring and coaching organisation led by a man called Paul Waugh, who everyone calls "Paulie". What we're doing is helping human beings to actually gain control of themselves, not for us to gain control of you, but for you to gain control, because that's where your power is. He is very charismatic, wonderful, sort of, big, warm personality. It's not in mentorship coaching that you should be putting your trust. It's in who's behind the mentorship and coaching. He could talk very well. He's really tapped into something there. It really draws your attention in, inspires you. Our responsibility not only is to help you think well, feel well, eat well, look well, be well, but to raise your level of conscious awareness that you own enough of yourself, that you know you'll never lose. APPLAUSE AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah! How many here see tendencies in you you're not happy with? Paul would talk about the millions he made as a businessman in South Africa, about his close relationship with Stephen Covey, the author of the best-selling 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. JAI: He used to speak here once a quarter. After almost a year of talking to Jai Singh, Jeff was invited to become part of the inner circle at Lighthouse, a Lighthouse Associate Elect. So I had a meeting with Jai, he said, "There's an opportunity "that's come up and the price is £25,000." He said the door was going to close, the next opening will be 50,000, then 100, then 250, so there was a sense of urgency around it. He said it would be the "best opportunity for you to succeed." It was a big risk to put in that much money, but I understood that you don't really get places unless you take... ..huge risks. After one year of mentorship with Tom Hasker, Simon was offered the same. They didn't come straight up to me and said, "Hey..." Like, "Become a Lighthouse partner." It was a lot more gentle, steady approach. It was a big investment - so it was £25,000 to become what they called an Associate Elect, like a Lighthouse Trainee Mentor, you know, in layman's terms. So you had to pay to become...? Yes, but nothing was never described as "pay", it was always, "You're making an investment in yourself." PHONE CHATTER In June 2020, when the world had just gone into its first Covid lockdown, Jeff joined Lighthouse full-time. In November, the same year, Simon did too. Jeff wasn't working anyway, because of Covid. Simon quit his full-time job. And what did being full-time involve? It involves being on these calls. These were, like, almost 30 people... ..on the call. Mainly listening to other people speaking, waiting for Paul Waugh to arrive. PAULIE: ..with feeling, and with care, and with consideration. And how long would they last? In the beginning, quite short. They got longer and longer as we went, so within six months, they're... ..five to six hours. But you'd never know when they were going to finish. I think we went on to about 6:00 on one call. Ten-hour call. Lighthouse has a team of live transcribers working on every call, and they mustn't miss a word of what Paul says. How does the transcribing work? Yeah, well, it's quite a procedure. PAUL: You're all mature enough to hear this... But believe you me, conscience is the great liberator. You're trying to get as much of Paul Waugh's words as you can. As Stephen Covey said, educating is conscience. What you'd have is two lead typers, you'd have two others come in behind them, and they'd fill in the abbreviations and the typos. You'd have others come in behind them, and they would highlight certain words which were later made into a summary. I'll leave you with that. By the end of a call, you'd probably have anything between a 50-page or 100-page transcript. So... So... So... So... So... So, with that... That's then sent out to a group of maybe ten, who listen back to the recording, go through the written transcript, and fill everything in, word for word. It's self-regeneration, self-renewal. And that's every day? Every day. Self-love, self-nurture, self-understanding. Every day, seven days a week, it just didn't make any sense. Saturday and Sunday? Saturday, Sunday. I had one Christmas Day off, one New Year's Day off. I went up to see Paul Waugh a couple of times, so I had those days off too. He started becoming, like, separated from people. We did go to his family's... He would... You'd find him sitting in the car on the phone to Jai, and it was actually quite embarrassing at times, so my friends come round to see me, they'd be like, "Where's Jeff?" And I'm like, "Oh, he's just upstairs "on the phone call, as usual." We were meant to go on holiday to Mexico for his dad's 60th. We didn't go because they said he couldn't go because there was a big launch happening. PAUL TALKS ON CALL Lighthouse team members are so busy that they're often not questioning, at least out loud, what the point of these calls are or what anyone's achieving. The moment he'd get off the phone calls, he'd have me asking questions, he'd have his sister asking him questions, his family asking him questions. "Is it mentoring or is it business?" "Are you working for them or are they mentoring you?" "Is it a pyramid scheme?" Around 20 Lighthouse team members lived together in shared rental houses in the Midlands. We believe one house near Wolverhampton had around seven members living in it. How did you end up living with your mentor? Tom had broached the idea of... "Why don't you come and live with me?" I don't know.. I just think...maybe it was persistence, I don't know, but there was just something in me that just went, "OK, fine. "Let's... Let's just do it." I kind of had the bedroom, and then he slept in what was the small living room-kitchen. It was a really tiny flat. No space, no sort of real privacy. All day, every day. Just me and him. Financially, I was paying for the whole flat and I was running out of money. I remember one evening, I was in my room quite late and I'd actually turned the lights out to try and get some sleep, and I could hear him walk in, standing just outside the door. I did feel this feeling the whole time, like... Like...he was watching me. They asked Jeff to move up with them. I just felt like the moment he moves to...them houses, that's it. Jeff started saying, "Oh, I think I'm going to sell my house "cos money's... Property's dead. "There's no-one... No-one invests in property any more." I was like, "That's rubbish." In June 2021, two and a half years after he first started speaking to Jai Singh, Jeff sold his house. He gave £28,000 to Lighthouse. He'd already remortgaged it and given them 32,000 of that money. Do you think you would have sold your house had it not been for Jai Singh's encouragement? No chance. I had no reason to sell that house, other than the reasons put in front of me and the opportunities put in front of me... ..at Lighthouse. Why do you think they wanted Jeff? Well, he's a cash cow. It sounds awful. They realised there was money to... ..to have...there. How much money did you hand over? The total I invested was £131,000. Key to the philosophy of Lighthouse were the levels. The idea that everyone is at a different stage of human spiritual development. What, the levels? Level one to four. They came from M Scott Peck, who was a psychotherapist. He's, uh... ..very intelligent. Chaotic, childlike. Institutionalised, somebody that maybe is religious but follows religions on blind faith. The sceptic, so these are scientists, who don't just follow things on blind faith. Mystic-communal, somebody that has really transcended a lot of challenges in life, is able to take quite a profound view on the world, see patterns, patterns of nature, see wisdom. What were the various levels that were in Lighthouse? Well, everybody was level one. Paul Waugh was level four. That was it? That was it. Why? A million reasons. He said nobody there had had an upbringing, and so they were in Lighthouse to get that upbringing that they didn't get at home. Paul said once you'd got to level four, you could start achieving your goals. Many people who don't know me very well think I'm a mystic, because I'm able to sort of feel things that no-one else can, because, quite simply, I'm able to... I'm in touch with this heightened sense of extraordinary awareness that's becoming more extraordinary all the time. I just... Increasingly, it seems like... ..these people were under control, under his control. He has his presence and... ..I felt nervous around him. Used to go and to play golf with Paul Waugh, and then we're teeing up and Paul just sort of gets out of the golf caddy, grunts at one of the seniors and shakes his foot. I look down at his foot, his shoelace has come undone. It was the way the senior responded. He sort of... He dropped his golf club. He sort of moved so fast across the green, dropped on one knee and knelt there, tying up his shoe laces. I looked at him and thought, "Is that where I'm going?" So, I would listen in, at times, and the types of topics they were discussing, which were beyond mentoring and coaching and business, and was more about beliefs and...how you should live your life. And then that's when I started worrying, cos I thought "He's literally being brainwashed all day, every day," and the topics were getting more sinister, so about narcissists, you know, toxic parents. Families become dominant families, controlling families, narcissistic families, become like HIV. That's what it is. I used to sit on these calls and I would hear people speaking about their families, endlessly, or their mothers endlessly. Of course, all families have difficulties. And...Lighthouse would find them, find them in your journal or find them in your personal mentoring. Other people's families were generally destructive, narcissistic, cynical, hateful, didn't want to let their family members go and would sabotage their potential. And they would sabotage Lighthouse, as a whole. So other people's families were dangerous. What about your family? What did they say about your family? My mother and sister are narcissistic, my father's weak - worst family at Lighthouse. My partner, Dawn, well, she just got endless flack. I won't repeat what he said. I think you've heard some recordings. Oh, we've got the recording, yeah. What are some of the things you remember from it, that he said? Oh, well... I don't know. LAUGHTER The whole thing is just incredibly belittling. He was sitting there all day, listening to quite unpleasant stuff, some of it insulting you personally. Why did you stick around? I thought the moment I... You know, I let this... You know, I finish with him, for my own self-dignity and worth... ..he's just going to plough right into it and we've lost him. And I feel like I was his... The only glimmer of hope of not him completely going into that, so... Sorry, I'm trying not to cry, but, um... Yeah, so, part of it was like not wanting them to win, which sounds awful. Other part is cos I love him obviously loads, and we did have such a nice time before he joined. CALL BEEPS JEFF SNIFFLES Cos I do really love him and I didn't want him to end up in that... ..that shared house, like, with all his money gone and not being him and us all losing him for good. Like Jai and like the rest of them now. CALL BEEPS Jeff was part of Lighthouse for three years. Simon for four. ..a little bit about my family... I've been working on this investigation with a whole team, and we've tracked down more than 40 people who've had experience of Lighthouse or Paul Waugh. I had four years of mentoring. My company paid for it. I'm an educated man, but I handed over tens of thousands of pounds and got nothing. Would you be OK if we use what you've told us? They told us about the history of Lighthouse. Started in 2004, it had two previous names - FranklinWaugh and The Entrepreneurial Club. Even 17 years ago, people were investing £25,000 and getting bullied by Paul Waugh. From the very beginning, members paid big money to become Lighthouse Associates. We kept hearing how so many long-term members were in terrible debt. Paul Waugh lives in a mansion, but the people below him live in shared houses. Like students, they don't pay bills, take out credit cards, until their credit rating is destroyed. One of the things that really stuck out to me from these calls was just how terrified some people were of Paul finding out they'd spoken to us. Threatened. She thought Paul was dangerous. Please, please don't use my name. I need to protect my family. And that long Lighthouse daily call was transcribed every single day. We've been given 16,000 pages of transcripts of exactly what was said on them. We also found a growing Reddit community, highly critical of Lighthouse. Let me tell you now... And the recordings you've been hearing? We have hours of them. Everything Lighthouse does is recorded. OVERLAPPING AUDIO He sent 181 calls. It's 90 hours of Jeff and Jai, but it charts their entire relationship. Paul Waugh says it's because they've got nothing to hide, but ex-members know it means Lighthouse have their deepest secrets recorded. We record everything, and we cut nothing out. HE CHUCKLES SMUGLY The recordings mean our team have been able to verify the accounts of former members and hear from those inside Lighthouse in their own words... Until we heard this recording, we'd heard Jai Singh, being a mentor, being controlling, described as a perpetrator. But Jai Singh has been in Lighthouse for more than a decade, and now we learn something about the process Jai's been through to become who he is today. So would you like to explain that...experience, Jai? In some cases, we have video too. This is Jai Singh's brother Sukh Singh, also part of Lighthouse. Here he is promoting it to newer mentees. When I started, I was... I was 24, fresh out of uni... ..and just really wanted to find some direction. I just was, like, "I'm feeling lost, I don't know why, "I don't know what this means, but I just... I need something." We think there are more than 40 people still involved with Lighthouse. People like 28-year-old Mel. In the beginning of 2020, I received a call from Dagmar, Melissa's mother, saying... ..that she was very worried, that Melissa had got involved with this organisation and she'd got a bank loan, £25,000, and she gave all this money to the Lighthouse Group. She had met her mentor through a dating app, Chris Dykler. I would say that she found the family that she thinks she never had in Lighthouse. They appeared to scrutinise a lot of aspects of her life. We had a holiday booked. It was just me, her and my wife. We were... The three of us, we were really close. She was saying that Lighthouse don't think it's part of her development plan. So I went on Google, the first thing that stood out was there was a lack of information on Paul, the leader. He'd been built up as this super-successful entrepreneur. It was just weird to find no trace of a supposedly prominent entrepreneur and business coach. When Martin found out that Mel had left her job to go full-time at Lighthouse without telling her family, he called her up. And so, I had a phone call with her, and I said, "Look, all this research I've done, these guys are absolute crooks." The next day, Chris, and somebody else in the group, came and took her away. One feels so powerless in a situation like that. You feel, "What... What can I do?" I mean, you can write to the police. Nothing happens. Mel writes a lot... ..online about being in Lighthouse and she says she's happy. How do you feel about that? Do you think she's happy? The difficulty about this whole process is that if Melissa is watching this programme, she will think that I am being hostile to her because she is happy. Why do you think that all of your family, and 99% of your friends, and things like that, think it's a bad idea? Surely... Doesn't that ring alarm bells? Are we ALL wrong? It is absolutely horrendous what, you know, Paul Waugh and his cronies... Such an odious person! How intelligent people like my daughter can fall victim of this, I find it totally incomprehensible. What's it like having a child in Lighthouse? It's as if my daughter's died... ..because she's not... My daughter that I know is not there any more. Hi, guys! So... Yeah, it's been a while. My bad! I have moved out of my room at university and I am back in my house in London, which is a bit of a mess, but we can overlook that. And I've booked my flights! Well, my dad booked my flights. SUCKS TEETH: I'm sorry. And I just... And it's just... And it is not Melissa. It cannot be Melissa. And this dreadful organisation, I mean, it absolutely... They should all be in jail. Basically brainwashing people and destroying families. Why have you decided to go public? I think it's... Basically, it's a last resort. Paul Waugh is...is, you know, says he's going to sue everybody's arse, and yippee, bring it on. Let's see him in court. The last place he ever wants to be is in court. I'm an old man, I'm self-employed, I've got nothing to lose. So if I'm not going to speak out, who is going to speak out? Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you now, yeah. I've got my volume up. Awesome. How are you? Yeah, I'm OK. Yeah, I'm good. You're not allowed to use "OK" and "good", remember. Oh, yeah. I'm...feeling focused. As we learnt more about the group, we also learnt more about their damaging behaviour. Are you feeling ready for your interview? Yes, I am, yeah. Yeah? Can I just get you to tuck that in your pocket? I'm Anthony Church, I'm 30, and I'm from Peterborough. So I struggled from when I was at school with anxiety, and then I did a masters in applied computing. And it was after I finished that course when I had a...breakdown, um... and...and took an overdose, um...making a suicide attempt. Um... and then later in that year, I came across Lighthouse. Awesome. You're looking very smart. I like it. Thank you. And then it was after that when I met Jai, and claiming that he'd be able to, um...get me better, that Lighthouse would be the cure for depression. That's what he said? Yeah, that's... Yeah, that's what he... Yeah, that's what he'd say, yeah. Anthony Church worked as a volunteer web developer for Lighthouse for four years. He was mentored by Jai Singh throughout. Yeah, look, even if you're not doing the exercise... Oh, yeah... ..must do the meditation. Shall we take a few minutes? Yeah. What made Anthony story worrying was Jai Singh's attitude to his medication. Anthony takes two types of medication for his mental health problems. It's one of these medications that Jai, um... ..then suggested that I speak to, um... ..my doctor about, um...reducing it. Jai would prepare me for the calls with the specialist and getting me to say about how much better I'm doing with Lighthouse, and, um... ..and they'd agreed to, er...reduce the medication gradually. He would tell you what to say in your calls with a specialist? Yes. Yeah. Jai Singh is, of course, not qualified to do this. Anthony eventually started questioning Lighthouse, asking things like why he had no contract for the money he'd handed over. So when I'd ask questions about Lighthouse, Jai would blame the medication and say I was being paranoid because of the withdrawal symptoms. Um...I knew I wasn't experiencing withdrawals, I was just thinking about things that didn't add up. When Anthony eventually left, he sent messages to other members with information about cults and mind-control. He soon received an email from Jai. READS: I don't think you have any idea what you're doing, Anthony. If this is you just having a psychological paranoid episode, as you have had before, and we can reason with you, then with sufficient evidence, we can present this to the lawyers and in the police report. Take this very seriously, Anthony. There are consequences to your actions. Erin joined Lighthouse in a very similar way to Jeff. She joined a book club. Jai Singh became her mentor. Erin was convinced to pay them £35,000. I took out an interest-free credit card, and the idea came from my mentor, Jai Singh. So he was talking to me about how I should change my mortgage to be able to borrow money back. I started to feel as though I couldn't think anything unless my mentor said it was a healthy thing to think or a true thing to think. Erin was sexually abused as a child by someone known to her family. We've changed her name. I talked about the abuse I'd experienced when I was younger. When Erin asked questions about the legitimacy of Lighthouse, her mentoring calls turned very nasty. They said there needs to be some kind of way of making my parents pay for not looking after me better as a child. There was talk of seeking legal action, taking my parents to court, getting money out of anybody. Obviously, to invest back in Lighthouse, I now know. Paul Waugh seemed obsessed with talking about sexual abuse. About how damaged I was. Because of what had happened to me, I was a dangerous person to be around. They were just telling me how awful I was. How dare I, you know, question anything about Lighthouse? And I thought, "My gosh, perhaps I am really damaged." And they said, "If you leave, if you turn against us, "remember, we have all your secrets." Erin did leave, and her experience shows just how much the group hates being criticised. They keep a close eye on what's written about them, especially on Reddit. And the reason we know about this is because it was one of Simon's jobs. My role was to monitor this. We had a document for every post, we took a screenshot. Look at the date, what was the Reddit pseudonym? If they'd posted something that was crucial or critical, I'd mention that to the right people so they could decide how they were going to respond. And respond they did. One of the ex-members that's taken the most abuse since leaving is a teacher called Jo. They wrote an email to my headteacher, basically saying that they had concerns about me and my ability to do my job, and that I was a threat to children. And then, they also began to CC in senior executives at the local authority. Oh, my gosh! And one email had two, um... A 25-page report and an 18-page report about me, with making various spurious claims. One of which was that I should be psychologically evaluated. JO SCOFFS It's just laughable, really. At some point after Jo posted her experience on Reddit, Lighthouse reported her to the police. The police looked at it, but took no further action. But Lighthouse wrote to her school to say she was under criminal investigation. And this is just cos you left? Because I left. And you wrote on Reddit? And because I asked questions. Because I wrote about my experience on Reddit, yeah. If you've got that sort of pathology, Jo, I'm telling you now, people like you should not be looking after little children. I'm telling you from me right now. And I will make sure that you get out of that job, as long as I live. Or unless you reform, or unless you get the help you need. Because what you're doing here is damn, goddamn awful. Throughout history, groups known as cults have led ordinary people to believe unbelievable things. We came from what some might call another dimension. The Rajneeshes describe themselves as dropouts from the top of culture. Charles Manson is the mystical leader of the hippie cult... Everyone you've heard from that's been part of Lighthouse believes it's a cult. Every person we've spoken to who's had a family member inside Lighthouse believes it's a cult. We also wanted multiple expert opinions from specialists. I've been doing this work for about 30 years now. We get more calls about Lighthouse than any other group in this country. Lighthouse International, in my opinion, meets the criteria for a cult. I'd say it's on the extreme end of the continuum. It seems to me that Lighthouse Group is a cult. They monopolise their members', er...time, energy, and are financially exploiting them. When did you first hear about Lighthouse? I had someone come to my practice to seek some help. I consider Lighthouse a very classic example of a cult. It fits all the criteria that I use. And what is that? Firstly, the cults are started and often continue to be led by a charismatic and authoritarian leader. But they're also bullies. So I kind of refer to them as charismatic bullies. The structure is steeply hierarchical. Everything comes from the leader. But importantly, the structure is heavily isolating. Then you have this process of what I call brainwashing, or we could also call coercive control. And then, the final point is that if you do this to people, you can then exploit them. So we see these phenomena, like people selling their houses, giving all their money to somebody. They've gone through this process, they didn't do it cos they were stupid. How does Lighthouse compare to other cults, other more famous cults? In this country, what I notice is there's such a strong stereotype that the only people in cults, and the only cults are in California, where people wear long, orange robes. And I really want to say to people that there is a cult in your neighbourhood. And coercive control is now recognised by the UK Government as being a crime when it occurs in a personal or family relationship. As this exact same dynamic can happen in a group, or in a workplace, or in a coaching business, if your boyfriend does that to you, he might go to prison, but if your neighbour does it to you, that's legal. So when we started investigating Lighthouse, it was not a religious group. But now, religion is a huge part of it. Yeah, I found that really fascinating, where they seem to be morphing a little bit and bringing a lot more Jesus talk. Which is not what I saw the first time I looked into them at all. The belief system of cults is very fluid. It's what works at any given time. And the ideology, really, is the kind of advertising. I-I call it the, um...sheep's clothing around the wolf. Does Lighthouse know that you're aware of them? Yes, they do. And I know they know, because they've been trolling me on Twitter. And in fact, I, last week, made a complaint to the Met Police about it, where I have 53 pages... That's not tweets, that's 53 pages of tweets. So the Met Police have decided that it's just a disagreement about ideas. But as one of the things they said in one of the tweets was, "You'll pay the price", I don't consider that a normal way of disagreeing with somebody. And also, contacting my previous workplaces is also not the way people usually disagree about ideas. I've genuinely not experienced the fear that I see of Paul Waugh. Well, cult leaders are psychopaths. They appear charming and nice one minute, and the next minute they're terrifying. I had to stare down a murderer in my cult who was trying to have my now-ex-husband take full custody of my children. For me, getting out of a cult was the most frightening thing I've ever done. I knew that I couldn't tell anyone that I was having doubts. And I thought, "If I can get away from Tom, "even for, you know, just a small window of time, "that will give me the opportunity to go." Not sure where I'd go, but I'd go. And I was walking away from the flat, first thing I did was I pulled out my phone and I called the police. And I said, "I'm not sure what to do, but I know that I can't go back there". They said, "Go to the police station. "We're going to tell them you're coming and that you feel unsafe." So I kind of put my phone on silent and just stuck it in my bag, cos I knew that if they would call me, I could feel it vibrating. PHONE VIBRATES I was stressed. Like, my anxiety level was off the chart. Simon left Lighthouse less than a year ago. He's never spoken to anyone even connected with the group since. We obviously wanted to put our allegations to Lighthouse, but before that, we had a few more pieces of our investigation to put together. Firstly, Paul's claims that he was a millionaire in South Africa. It's one reason people trusted him as a mentor, as an inspiration. So we had a South African investigative journalist look into those claims, who found three businesses he ran there. Hello. Can you hear me? Hey! These companies themselves, there are no properties registered under them or any kind of assets. Their, er...business addresses are usually residential areas. Essentially, flats that Paul rented out in Durban. Were you able to speak to anyone that knew him, that met him? Yeah, yeah. His former landlady remembered, er...you know, Paul as a colourful, colourful character. He was always trying out these get-rich-quick schemes. He ran one of his businesses out of her flat. But she also remembered Paul was struggling, in fact, to pay rent on time. That's interesting. So we have a recording of Paul... ..saying between the ages of 24 and 35, he produced about 100 million... HE SCOFFS AND CLEARS THROAT That... Catrin, that is absolutely... It...it...it can never be true. It would not have been possible for someone running millions to have not a single asset in South Africa. None of these businesses have any kind of profile, and this is a person who then, you know, struggles to pay his rent on time. Paul seems to have been just an average Joe trying his luck in different kinds of businesses. We've been told that those in Lighthouse are in terrible debt, and we were able to find evidence. We found 17 County Court judgments against current members of the team for unpaid debts totalling over £87,000. £20,000 of them are for Jai Singh. Paul Waugh, well, he has none of these kind of debts. We found Paul's very nice five-bedroom house with a sauna, half an acre and a Range Rover outside with a private numberplate. Whilst he lives in this rented place, many Lighthouse team members live all together in shared houses. Hi! Hi, there! Is that better? Juliet rented a six-bedroom house out to just Paul Waugh. She was told he would have guests staying, but ended up with around eight Lighthouse team members living there. When they left, she was flooded with letters. They were all to do with these people who were living there who owed money. They were just pouring in every single day. When I was living back there, I got a knock on the door from this guy. They were tracking down a guy called Jai Singh. And he said to me, "He owes money". And I said, "Listen, I rented this house to these people. "It was Wild West here." Every single bedroom had been turned into what I would deem as a bedsitting room. There were things like kettles in the bedrooms, a chest freezer full of meat up in the bedroom! Pots and pans in the main, um...bathroom. I said, "They shouldn't have been living here". I gave them Paul Waugh's address. I would suggest you contact him. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING We also looked into Paul's claims of being very close with Stephen Covey, author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. Stephen Covey died in 2012, but I contacted his company, FranklinCovey, where many employees still there used to work with Stephen every day. They told us... Something else that kept coming up - we had multiple people who've been close to Paul Waugh tell us he liked to show people videos of him having sex with women. I just said, "Please, I don't want to see that". And he made me look at this. I was horrified. Absolutely horrified. I felt really violated. And then, something totally unexpected happened. We found out about a secret investigation into Lighthouse ordered by the UK Secretary of State for Business. Lighthouse were being taken to court. And this document gives the reasons government investigators say Lighthouse should be shut down. READS: The investigator has written to Mr Waugh on a number of occasions. He has failed to attend at least five scheduled interviews. That's...that's an email to... ..the investigators for the Secretary of State. They've been able to find some stuff that we couldn't get to. Most significantly, the money. We could see that almost £2.5 million had been paid into Lighthouse's bank account. And between March 2018 and July 2022, more than 1.1 million had been paid out to Paul Waugh. Paul argues this is because he put the most in. And then came Lighthouse's day in court. Paul Waugh arrived with another 22 people from Lighthouse. Jeff and Dawn came, too. And five hours later, a judge shuts down Lighthouse in the public interest. By this stage, we had invited Paul Waugh and Jai Singh for interview and sent the group 120 allegations in writing. It was time to talk to them. Paul's there. Hi, Paul. How you doing? How do you feel about being closed down, shut down in the public interest? Well, it is in my interest. It's totally in my interest. I've been trying to shut it down for a while, so... You've been trying to shut it down? I've been trying to shut it down for a while. Not the court? Well, the court, too. We've worked here together on this. So we've shut it down... A court has said you're working against the public interest. Well, those are the issues we will deal with reputationally after this. Are you going to carry on? Yes! We are carrying on! How do you feel, Paul, about the fact that so many people think you're running a cult? We're not running a cult. Because they don't know what a cult is. They don't know... If you asked them what's the difference between a cult and a community that supports people, they wouldn't be able to tell you. Why do you think so many people say it? Because they're slurring us. They're smearing us. That's exactly what they do. These parents are child abusers, that you're supporting. And you supported Sir Jimmy Savile... You... Me? You. OK. You supported Jimmy Savile and his paedophilia. You going to take that out or are you gonna keep it in? Paul, why do you...? Come close. Why do you...? Paedophile supporter. Why, Paul, have you contacted people's employers who've criticised you? W... Why have you done that? Because...because...because if my people, or the people that worked with us, were going around on Reddit like the foul retards they were, on that paedophilia site, I would want to know that that's how my people, or people I work with, or an employee, handles their problems. And...and the companies are grateful for us telling them. Some people have been fired for this. Who's been fired? You go and find out. You just... I'm not... It's data-protected, I can't tell you. Right. You could just tell me that. No, I can't. It's data-protected. OK, fine. We've sent you all of our allegations in huge detail, and you've not responded to any of them. Well, that's... Well, there's a reason for that. Why is that? Because I want to know the context of what those things are. Where did they come from? A lot of it is just absolute nonsense. I am responding. I'm responding, I'm responding with our own documentaries, with our own videos. We're doing it. Do you think, given the level of criticism and given the level of people who are deeply unhappy with their treatment at Lighthouse, it is...? How many people are deeply unhappy with your treatment of Lighthouse? Here they all are! How many are deeply unhappy? Would you like to talk? She said, "all these people that are deeply unhappy." Ask them...! Have you spoken to the people...? Ask them! Go on! Go on, you all tell me. Ask them...! Tell me, tell me. Tell me what you'd like to say. You're here. How many of you are deeply unhappy? Not at all. She really, desperately wants one of you to be deeply unhappy. OK, please tell her, for the...for the god of Wales! Paul? Please ask her. Paul? Thank you. We've had enough. No comment. I fully appreciate that the people currently in Lighthouse... No comment. ..like Lighthouse. No comment. This is going nowhere. This is going nowhere. Do you think it is right for us to investigate, given the level of complaints there are...? Oh, yes, but... Of course! But you must receive the facts. True and fair and complete... Send us the facts, Paul. You're getting them. They're coming. Send us the facts. They're coming. Have a god night. Jai, could I ask your reaction to the shutting down of Lighthouse? It's not surprising. We... Do you agree it's working against the public interest, then? No. Because I'm standing here. Many, many people standing here have actually benefited, and you guys have only spoken to the people... HORN BLASTS ..who have got some, a vendetta. Why did you tell Jeff that the price of being an Associate was going to increase so much, and that wasn't the case? We were about to expand. So you told Jeff... We've got the recording. Well, I've got it as well. I'll share the recording with you. The price of being an Associate Elect has never actually increased. So, do you agree that was a pressurised sales technique, Jai? No, it wasn't. No. Leave it now. Leave it now. Leave it now. It's done. Would you like to say anything? Everyone's allowed to have their say. Being part of Lighthouse isn't something you forget, that you can just move on from. It changes you. I'm nearly 40 years old, this is not how I imagined my life being. But I'm working hard each day to recover, to heal, to...to...to...to rebuild my life, and I will. I think perhaps the average person, let's say, look at a group like Lighthouse and look at us and think, "Well, that would never happen to me." It can happen to anyone. If you could speak to your daughter now, what would you like to say to her? Er...forgive me for everything I'm saying if you think, you know, that I'm trying to do it to hurt you, because I'm not. I'm doing it because I think it's the last... My last chance to save you. Am I glad I stuck with him? Yeah, 100%. Cos he's back to being like Jeff. We're trying to get everything back to normal the best we can. We've just got a puppy and Jeff's back to sailing. We've just got accepted on our first home together, which won't be getting sold to be given to a cult. Are you telling people, "I was in a cult"? Huh! Well, I am now, yeah. Well, this, yeah. Huh-huh! Um...I do. I find it hard, cos it's, er...it's embarrassing. The first person I told, um... ..was my...was my friend James. Who, at the time, I didn't actually know James that well. I just went for a pint with him and, er... ..I just sort of came out with it. I said, "I've been part of this weird thing and it looks like a cult". So, yeah, I do find it quite hard to say, but I do say it. MUSIC: Atmosphere by Joy Division # Walk in silence # Don't walk away. #
