Look, Franz's got a new girlfriend. You going to eat them together? - Don't be so selfish. - Leave us a bit. Labour made Man. Look, Franz. You're not a child. You're not at school. You're with the SS. You swore all eglance to the Fuhrer, and were given a new gun. It's not a plaything, You might shoot your comrades. Say something. Cat got your toungue? Work or I won't record your hours. General's coming. To the left... That's it. Anybody seen my spade? Hey, here's the grub to feed the defenders. Thanks. - You got moonshine? - Sure. I did it! It opens and closes. See that? Nothing wrong with it. It just needs oiling. I'll do it - Good day. - Hello. People are coming back. Kapustikha did. - Yes? - Yes. What does she want in the woods? - Good day. - Hello. It's cold in the woods. They're back 'cos they saw it's okay here. - Back from the woods? - Yes. Everything's fine. The hut's okay. - How are the kids? - Fine. Watch your goat or she'll get that German. - Good day. - Hello. Wait... You want her, right? Be a man. Take it easy. She's only a woman. Do it, but don't give it a thought, and don't take it to heart. I figure you've never had a woman. Well, I can take care of her... Tomorrow. What are you doing? His officer doesn't like it. What do you mean, mother? He just gave me a hand and you've made him my man. They're talking shop, not me. Polina! Why are you worrying? What did you expect? You'll have 10-15 minutes to yourself tomorrow. Today, don't take your eyes off her. And she needn't know. I only wish you well - like a son. And don't fall in love. I'll go to the river to rinse the laundry. It's late. You can do it tomorrow. It'll spoll. Thanks. It was good. Help yourself. Don't mind her. She's young and bad and flirty. Say something! You saying you don't understand? Poland is next to you, they understand German over there. Come on, say something. You've got fine legs and tits. Zero reaction. Okay. Want help? I don't understand you. I know why you went to the river so late. What should I do? What should I do? Talk about the weather? It's getting cold. Your dress isn't warm. You need to get warm. You're so beautiful. You're in my heart. Understand? Right here. You played around when you were young, and you still are... You turned the guy's head, he forgets his service. It's quiet now, thank God. Those with any sense took to the woods. But Kapustikha's back. Pruzyna too. Thank God! Be quiet, dear, it's a sin to have fun. Don't you know Dad and Pavel are having a hard time. Mama, dearest. - Good morning. - Good morning. You should learn to shave first, then chase girls. Look at him. Shining like a copper coin. Mum, where d'you keep the goose fat? Breakfast! We treat scratches with it. I'll spread it here, gut? This doesn't hurt On the chaff, on the straw, It'll hurt and let off. You'll soon be fine again. Franz... Great grease. She'll get you some milk, you spazieren... - Gut apetite. - Okay... Keep an eye on her. See that she doesn't leave. You'll get your's soon. I've fallen. Get up and catch up with me. Touch wood. How 'bout some moonshine? Schnaps? Get some. No, no, thanks. Come on, eat. I'll make potatoes for supper. No, no. Thank you. Take care of her. What if they'll want to check? You understood me? Mama, deareat! Albina, where are you hidden? Come out, all's clear. Fedorka, Pruzyna! Where are you? Hey, you got any moonshine? Kucherikha, where are you going? It's dark, go home. Leave it all. Do it scum. I'm not going to hide you. Then look out for the partisans. Where are we going to hide him? Let him hide himself. Look at him In Pavel's jacket He looks like one of ours. Not two ways about it What happens when the partisans come? Please don't! He's mute! He's my brother! Where's that from? Trophy. The boots, too. Why are you goggling at her? Camouflaged... Wanted to sit it out. You're fit to haul machine-gun plates. Trophy, indeed. Give them over. Swop with him. Do it. See? The guy's gonna help the people's avengers. Even if he's not at the front. What are you waiting for? Not our language. Your village? Petukhi. Petukhi? It was burnt down. We hid ourselves. They could've left. The forest is quite near. But maybe they didn't come, stayed in the forest... Your mum, brothers and granny. Mama! Where's Polina? How did you save yourself? Stay here, I'll be back. Don't run away. Pavel! Where's that... your Kraut? They took Fransk. I don't know which unit. Took his watch, saw it was foreign-made and took him away. I said he didn't kill, but they took him anyway. What will they do to him? What'll they do? He's a Kraut! Mum, we'll take you to our unit on our way back before the SS come. You got clothes to change? We've been eaten alive by lice. It's unbearable. Sure. So they took him. What would you do to him? That's up to our men to decide. Look at what happened to Lazarchuk. Well, he killed the German who was shooting at Mum. If he isn't far tell him to go. Albina says to me: 'Why don't you" "cover our bones with earth?" I say, "I will, dear Albina, I will." We should dig them graves. I'm going. Burial. Hey, Kucherikha, where are you? You didn't call for me and hid. Why didn't you take us with you? Louder please. You hid. I was waiting for you. Get it? Why didn't you ask me, we'd have hidden together. Why didn't you collect my bones, give 'em to me? If you'd hidden us, we'd still be alive. I wish I had a map and a compass. What a smart one. - Partisans! - Germans! That's salt Come over here. I love you, you silly. Fascist! We should get a canary. Seen one around here? That's for fish, you idiot. Where have you been? What's scratching at you! Out, verluchter, fuck you, or I throw a grenade. Please don't! We're local. My bro' here, he's mute and sick. See if there are more of them. Well, Stalin's bandits! Stalin wasn't enough for these tater-eaters. Who you fighting for? Why's he grinning? The officer asks why the guy's grinning. He's mute. They are collective farmere, bandits. Let 'em go. They're coming, a whole group! Take care of them quietly. Let 'em go quietly. To the foreat everybody! I never saw a mute. There was a gunner, Moshkovich he was called. He was deaf after contusion. He couldn't hear, but he could talk well. Aren't you from Altai? I am. Why? My mum comes from Leninogorsk. I come from Ryder, Leninogorsk it's called now, under Stalin. Englishmen mined are there. Go on. My mum speaks like you. So she's my countrywoman! We're wasting time. - Polina, jump! - You bastard! Hey, give me a hand. Wheel's broken. What are you, deaf? Understand nothing? - Concussion? - Kazik! Coming, Mum. Thank you, you're a good man. Water! Thank you, good man. He doesn't talk. Must be mute. You mustn't say that. Why not? He may be mute but he understands, only can't speak - like a dog. What is it? Will you look at the girl here? Found a doctor! This man's a doc. Move, Kazik. What can I do? Nothing. She needs medicine, a hospital. I haven't any, and nowhere to get it. Can't get to the village... shooting there. Even just Streptocid. Don't ask me anymore. Out of here, back to the marshes. Keep your documents! - Get on your way. - I live here. They are crushing Jews and partisans there. But welcome - if you insist. Get lost, granddad. I live here. Your mother was a good person. Mine too. She gave it to me. Halt! Your mum's a good person, my mum's a good person. Our lockets are alike. Mom gave it to me. It says she keeps me. Our mothers believe in this. You've got one too. Morning. Good morning. Are you ill? I need Streptocid, bandage, cotton wool. - Say it again. - Streptocid... I don't understand. Streptocid, bandage, cotton wool. I understand, Streptocid. Too much. Good day. Is he sick? Who isn't now? The mute's got the drugs. Something at least... My mum's a good person. Mine... good... keeps... All mothers... Fascist! Bastard! He's not mute - he's German. It's typhoid fever. Typhoid. When will we get there? Soon. Soon? It's going on forever. My feet are numb. When will you kill him? Soon - when he gets well. I didn't tell mum you got a gun. Don't. You're a sensible girl. Here's a sweet. Now listen to this one. It was the last war, the German one. Why don't you eat? We were freezing in the trenches. Couldn't even make tea. If we made a fire, we could be shot by our own men. For giving ourselves away. There was a fighter, Gabinsky he was called. He was a machine gunner. Well, before battle he'd fill up the gun cover with snow... to keep the barrel cool. When the fighting was over, he'd pour the hot water out and we'd treat ourselves to tea. And the Germans knew: If the Russians' gun is banging away, They're gonna have tea. So that's that. Why don't you eat? Good people, I thought they'd kill both of us, I was crying. Then I told them the truth about you, about Mum, about Petukhi, how it was burnt. You don't remember. What are you doing? He is a human being. So he's a human being... Give me the gun, for Christ's sake. He's a Kraut, a bastard. None of them human. I gave Dad's watch for it. Tell him. Maybe he'll listen to you. I did. Tell me what. Did Hitler meet with Stalin, or not? - Not understand. - You don't? You say, collective farms. You Germans might see there's nothing sweet 'bout collective farms. Understand? Tell me if Hitler met with Stalin. Stop pestering him. He'll tell you if he wants to. Where is he? Kazik has one bullet, just one. He gave it to me to play to stop me crying. Mum, bro' - killed, the boy saw everything. He hid in the hay. Ran out when the shed caught fire. Didn't sleep, eat or talk for three days, I'm not his mother. I'm his godmother. Kazik is a good boy. Try to understand. What can I do? He always does what he's decided. You bastard - got away! I've got to warn them. Don't! Lord, forgive me! I didn't want it Mum says - if you're asked, you do it. Forgive me! I don't want to kill, don't want to hurt anyone. Do you hear me? Forgive me! It was too late. Where were your eyes? You, commissar, said to lay an ambush. So the guys were gunned down. Don't try to find who's to blame. It's your fault commissar. - Where are the drums? - What drums? What did the commissar say? What drums? The machine gunner's dead. Well, who answered for the drums? Who answered for the drume? Fukson? Where are the cartridge drums? You lost them? Some guy did something wrong and Fukson is to blame. Don't speak for others. Speak for yourself. This - he didn't lose! He lost the cartridge drums. You know the consequences? What's the use of cartridge drums without a machine gun? Our men caught it They might've needed just one... Hand in your rifle. Commissar! Guys, comrades, what are you doing? Hey, you... Come up here. You deaf? Come help me. He's an invalid, he's mute. Shut up - your mute'll be none the wores for it. God take it - you're pregnant! - Take off his belt. - Fukson, take it off. Why? Do what you're told. Take it off. Yatsevich, bend those two birch-trees. - What do you want? - Stand still. Don't move. Comrades! I'm a Communist. You bastard, you let us down! That one now. Fascists! Let it go! Out of the way. Ready, commissar... Fascists! Comrades! Comrades! Comrades! She needs water. Wasser, wasser. Hey, move it. Quiet, my girl. You should take care of yourself now. Kazik... Water for Polina... Franz - Adrian TOPOL Polina - Sverlana IVANOVA
