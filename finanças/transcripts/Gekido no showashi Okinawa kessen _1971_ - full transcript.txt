This is a film based on historical facts. However, some fictional characters and situations were added for dramatic purposes. The Toho Co., Ltd. August 7th, 1942. The U.S. military dispatches a large naval fleet to assault Guadalcanal. This marked the start of the U.S. military's Pacific counteroffensive. Guadalcanal was to be defended to the death! After six months of deadly battle... ...the ammunition and food supplies of the Japanese garrison were exhausted. Suffering from starvation, wounds, malaria and amoebic dysentery... ...they were finally vanquished. The U.S. military counteroffensive that conquered Guadalcanal... ...spread from island to island like an avalanche: Bougainville, the Bismarck Archipelago... ...New Guinea, Makin, Tarawa... ...and finally, in 1944, on July 7th... ...the defenders of Saipan chose the path of ''gyokusai.'' The Americans were holding a dagger to the throat of Japan. lmperial Army Headquarters struggled to predict the next American move. Would they bypass lwo Jima and head straight for mainland Japan? Or would they cut across the East China Sea and invade China? Perhaps it'll be Taiwan, or maybe Okinawa? No matter what, we cannot let the enemy get any closer. No matter how much we bleed, no matter how much sacrifice it takes... ...we must hold them south of Okinawa. About three months before, Headquarters had reinforced the defenses of the... ...southwestern islands, and deployed the 32nd Army to Okinawa. The 32nd was commanded by Lt. General Watanabe. The basic strategy was to use the 32nd to... ...secure the airfields, so that the enemy could be attacked at sea from the air. Okinawa, therefore, was to become a giant aircraft carrier. lye-jima lsland had ideal terrain. Three airfields were to be built in the east, center and west of the island. The main island of Okinawa was also to have three airfields, in the north, center and south. However, despite the tireless efforts of the military, local government, and civilians... ...little progress was made toward their planned completion by July. lt was about that time that the sad news of the fall of Saipan was announced. The enemy will undoubtedly land on this island as well. Now is the time for the military and civilians to unite against the enemy. Army Commander Watanabe roamed the island, delivering blunt assessments of the situation... ...in an attempt to galvanize the people. But instead they aroused feelings of anxiety and fear. The Army was a sham, consisting of a few officers and construction workers. The 32nd Army had a head, but no limbs... ...so how could it possibly protect Okinawa? When the time comes, let all civilians unite with the Army in embracing fate... ...and be prepared to die an honorable death! Battle of Okinawa A Tempestuous Annal of the Showa Period After the annihilation of Saipan, despite dwindling resources... ...lmperial Headquarters took great pains to rush reinforcements to Okinawa. The first group, the 9th Division from Northern Manchuria, arrived on July 11th. Subsequently, the 24th Division, also from Northern Manchuria, arrived on July 18th. On August 8th, lmperial Headquarters made some command changes. To replace Lt. General Watanabe... who was suffering from battle fatigue... ...the head of the Military Academy, Lt. General Ushijima, was made 32nd Army Commander. During the Manchurian campaign, he was nicknamed the ''Merciless Brigadier.'' The Army Minister agrees that... ...only Ushijima can be trusted with the task of defending Okinawa. Please tell me... if there is anything that we at lmperial Headquarters can do. We will get you whatever we can, be it men or munitions. l'll be on my way. Gyokusai... Please, let there be no gyokusai. For the sake of the nation, you must hold out as long as possible. Well, l think that tenaciousness is my one virtue. Farewell. Sir...! August 10th: Lt. General Ushijima arrives to take command. His Chief of Staff, Major General Cho lsamu, was known to be open-minded. ln the Army he was famous for his ''can-do'' attitude. Colonel Yahara Hiromichi, the Senior Staff Officer... ...graduated from Army University on an lmperial scholarship... ...and had been sent to the United States to continue his education. The 62nd Division from Northern China was the last to be deployed in Okinawa. They joined the 9th Division, the 24th Division, the 44th lndependent Brigade... ...a Tank Corps, an Artillery Regiment, and a Naval lnfantry Unit. ln all, about 100,000 soldiers were ready for battle. They look strong, don't they? They look strong, don't they? Eh? Eh? l'll bet the mainland soldiers are tough! Eh? Yeah... Come over here! Come see me tonight! l'll keep my bed warm for you! The Americans would be stopped at Okinawa! Such was the boast of the military, and the people believed it. lndeed, they could not help but believe it... ...for they had never before seen such an overwhelming display of military might. Just give me a minute, okay? The 24th Division and a unit from the Artillery Regiment will go to Nakagami. The 9th Division and the core of the Artillery Regiment will be based at Shimajiri. The 62nd Division will be deployed between them. This means that, no matter where the enemy lands... ...whether it's the eastern or western shore... ...these divisions will attack on the first night... ...and then, by the second night, we can pound them with 400 cannons. After bombarding them, we'll launch a general offensive... ...and thoroughly crush them on the beaches. l believe the enemy may eventually deploy five or six, maybe up to ten divisions. But what if they land them all at once? The outcome will then depend on how we array our forces. My idea is that we fight them in the caves. Caves? Yes, sir. The coral reefs of Okinawa, particularly those in the south, contain a multitude of caves. We should take advantage of them, and build a huge underground fortress. Coral is something like chalk, so it can withstand one-ton bombs. Here in Mabuni we have a perfect example. l estimate that these caves could easily hold an entire division. Really... ...an entire division? But lmperial Headquarters wants Okinawa to be an air-base. When the U.S. forces landed on Saipan... ...we launched a general offensive using all our airborne assets. But we suffered a fatal blow, and were utterly crushed. So l don't understand what Headquarters is thinking. ln response to the fall of Saipan, the Government... ...ordered Okinawa's elderly, women and children to evacuate. Yumi! Yumi! Ken... Don't let those mainland brats beat you up. Be tough. Yeah. Dad, you're a Japanese too. You tough it out as well! Yeah... On the night of August 21st, the Tsushima- maru, carrying 700 school children... ...headed to Kyushu, along with two other ships and an escort ship. There is a possibility that we might encounter an enemy submarine... ...so while we are sailing, you must obey the orders of the Captain! YES, SlR! You must never come out on deck during daytime! YES, SlR! No tossing trash into the ocean! YES, SlR! Around 10:00 PM on the 22nd, the engine of the Tsushima-maru broke down. lt lagged behind the two other ships... ...and drifted near Akuseki lsland in the Tokara Archipelago. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. lt's been my opinion from the start that maybe we shouldn't... ...no, that we must not evacuate. l don't want another tragedy like the Tsushima-maru. Okinawa is guarded by 100,000 soldiers of the lmperial Army. And why would the enemy attack our little island anyway? So how can the civilian population support the troops? The elderly, the young, men, and women? lmperial Headquarters could no longer stand by... ...while all the garrison's efforts were spent on the construction of the fortresses... ...and so, on September 14th, they dispatched Air Force Staff Officer Lt. Colonel Kamai. Kamai was an expert in the construction of airfields. This is an order! ''Devote your full attention to the completion of the airfields by the end of September.'' ''You are personally responsible for the completion of this work.'' By order of lmperial Headquarters, the 32nd Army will temporarily... ...cease construction of the fortresses, and instead build the airfields. Can l depend on you to carry out this task?! lt shall be as you command! Huh? So now we stop digging and start leveling, is that it? Whatever... Under the direction of Staff Officer Kamai... ...construction proceeded without breaks for sleep or rest, with the result that... ...the 32nd Army completed the airfields in only ten days. On October 3rd, Commander in Chief of the Pacific fleet, Admiral Nimitz... ...received orders from the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff... ...to occupy Okinawa by March 1st, 1945. Stealthily steaming towards Okinawa, the U.S. prepared to launch Operation lceberg. Early on October 10th, a swarm of enemy airplanes descended upon Okinawa. The first wave of 240 aircraft destroyed the newly completed airfields. The second wave of 220 planes sunk many ships. The third wave, 140 strong, destroyed the ports. The fourth wave sent 130 planes against Naha City... ...almost instantly setting most of the city on fire. The Prefectural Office was the only building to survive intact. The planes that raided Okinawa were part of Vice Admiral ''Bull'' Halsey's Third Fleet. After attacking Okinawa, ''Bull'' continued south... ...to bomb the airfields of Luzon... ...and attack Taiwan. When informed of this, the Naval Air Corps flew 500 aircraft to Taiwan. ''Our Air Corps has destroyed the enemy fleet...'' A great victory was announced. The people leaped to their feet in joy. However, these reports were in error. Soon, a reconnaissance plane discovered that Halsey's fleet was intact. But by this time, lmperial Headquarters had already set plans in motion. Thinking that the enemy had been seriously weakened... ...they believed that it would be possible to hold the island of Leyte. Three divisions from Taiwan, and one from Shanghai, were rushed to the Philippines. But this meant that new troops would have to be sent to reinforce Taiwan. Good, quite good. With this kind of firepower... ...we'll be able to crush the enemy as soon as they come ashore. And while they're getting shelled, the ''blue frogs'' of Kerama will thrust... ...at the sterns and bottoms of the enemy ships. The Kerama lslands are located 35 kilometers from Naha. ''Blue Frogs'' were one-man plywood boats capable of reaching 20 knots. These suicide weapons were powered by car engines, and crammed full of explosives. The first squadron was based at Zamasu lsland. The second squadron was based at Aka and Kerama lslands. The third squadron was located on Tokashiki lsland. Each squadron had 100 carefully hidden Blue Frogs, ready to strike. The Keramas are hilly, so the enemy will probably bypass them and land on lye. With that as a foothold, they'll try to establish a beachhead on the Kadena Coast. Yahara, when do you think the enemy will land? Well... Next year, when the cherry blossoms bloom. Good. That's the right attitude. By the time the blossoms wither... ...we'll have chased every single enemy ship back to the East China Sea. l have a telegram from Colonel Hattori to Colonel Yahara. ''Select a division from the 32nd Army for redeployment to Taiwan.'' ''There will be a meeting in Taipei to discuss the details of the troop movement.'' What's that all about? lt's to fill the hole left by the troops that were sent to Leyte. Assholes! How can they do this to Okinawa... and to me?! Should we go to Taipei? That's where the meeting is, so we have no choice. The 32nd Army is part of the Taiwan Command. General, what should we do? Should we ignore this? No, we have to go. We'll go and tell them what we think. Considering the overall military situation, one cannot understate the strategic value... ...of the Philippine lslands, and we therefore suggest that... ...you reconsider its importance, and that of the other south-western islands. We understand why the core of the 32nd has been redeployed. Simply put, they bluntly stated that if the Philippines were so important... ...then the entire 32nd Army should be stationed there. Our thinking regarding the 32nd should be clear from this written opinion. l was ordered to add nothing so l will say no more. The Taiwan conference ended without a decision, in a haze of ambiguity. But the ambiguity was resolved... ...when the 32nd received a telegram from lmperial Headquarters. ''The best divisions of the Okinawa garrison will be redeployed. ''Their Commander will select the troops to be transferred''? This is outrageous! Those Headquarters guys don't understand anything! lf they steal our best men, what will become of us? All our plans will come to nothing. General! lt's an order. lt is our duty to obey orders. Because of our soldiers, we can go to school today. lt's because of our soldiers, who fight for our country, for our country! On December 24th, Governor lzumi headed to the mainland on official business. Well, l'll be back as soon as l can. Have a safe trip. However, the Governor was fated never to return to Okinawa. Dear, what on Earth are you doing?! lt's an evacuation, an evacuation! Pack up right now and get on the boat! So abruptly? Don't complain... women and children need to get out of here. What about you? Me, l'm an Okinawan. l'm gonna go use this on the Army Commander! How horrifying! Silly! l'm now the barber for the Command Staff. They're paying me 150 yen a month, and as an enlistment bonus... ...they gave me two months in advance. Here's 300 yen. Take it and leave. What? There are no more evacuation ships? ln order for us to take best advantage of our forces... ln order for us to take best advantage of our forces... ...we should plan on a major battle in Shimajiri. We'll move the 62nd forward, and have them change places with the 24th. The 44th Brigade will be shifted to the Chinen Peninsula. What? Moving again?! Back to digging holes, huh? Get outta here! Yahara... you can't win a war by going on the defense. l'm aware of that. But if we don't have the troops to launch an attack... ...our only choice is to wage a war of attrition. There's a telegram from lmperial Headquarters. lt's from Colonel Hattori. Well?! Sir! The 84th Division from Himeji will be deployed here... ...to replace the 9th Division that went to Taiwan. Let me see that! Hey, that's great! General, this is good news. They haven't forgotten about Okinawa after all. However, the next day, January 23rd... ...the deployment of the 84th Division to Okinawa was cancelled. Who canceled the deployment of the 84th Division from Himeji to Okinawa?! That'd be me. Those orders came directly from the Joint Chiefs of Staff... ...and were decided upon by the General Staff of lmperial Headquarters. l've already informed Okinawa. l know... Then why? Why...? l thought about it all night last night. l told the Joint Chiefs of Staff this morning that we should cancel the order. But why?! The troops in Okinawa will die without reinforcements! Do you really think that if we sent troops to Okinawa, they'd arrive safely? We must make it happen. A unit in Okinawa is worth two or three here at home! Okinawa must be sacrificed to protect the mainland! Don't forget that. We're late in setting up our homeland defenses... ...so we can't afford to divide our forces for the sake of Okinawa. l completely understand how the 32nd Army must feel about this. But l have to consider... the bigger picture. l see. Now l really understand what they think of us on the mainland. So, we fight alone, and die alone! Bye... What did they say? They asked me to become the Governor of Okinawa. Of Okinawa? And... what did you say? l made my decision. l accepted. lf l declined, someone else would have to go. lf it were anywhere else l probably would have passed. On January 31st, 1945, Governor Shimada arrived in Okinawa. Okinawa is now at the vanguard... ...of Japan's one capital, two boroughs, and 43 prefectures. l know we will all work very hard together. Our first task is to evacuate the civilian population. The military expects... ...that enemy fleets will assault lwo Jima or Okinawa around mid-February. Mid-February, you say? Yeah. lf not in February, then March for sure. Hey, wait, wait... No cameras. l'll be promoted to Lt. General after they reshuffle in March. Wait until then! Boats will take too long. We'll evacuate the elderly, women, and children to the northern hills. Of course, the northern district is short on food. Nevertheless, we cannot let the elderly and children... ...remain in what could become a battlefield. At the time, 7th and 8th grade students... ...volunteered as couriers, and were attached to the various units. Older students joined the ''lron Blood Loyalist Troops,'' and trained daily. All told, there were 1700 male students. Older female students made daily visits to the military hospital to train as nurses. These numbered about 500. February 18th, the U.S. invades lwo Jima. A U.S. force of 60,000 men... ...assaulted 19,000 Japanese defenders under Lt. General Kuribayashi. After lwo Jima, they'll come for Okinawa! We must defend Okinawa with our own hands! This is your homeland! This is the front line of our Empire! Approximately 20,000 civilians were drafted... ...in order to bolster the fortified defenses. These men were between 17 and 45 years old. Major Jin Naomichi, reporting for duty as Air Force Staff Officer. Welcome. So we have another airplane expert, but still no airplanes. Welcome, indeed. Kamai had us build airfields, then he left. Did you happen to bring us any airplanes as a gift? Sir... Well... l hesitate to explain my strategy to such an airplane expert, but here it is. We'll glue the entire island of Okinawa to our suicide planes, and crash it into the enemy. l figure our chances of hitting them are 90%. That's not bad. Well? Even ''War of Attrition'' Yahara likes this plan. They've sent us no planes. So how can lmperial Headquarters expect us to launch air strikes from Okinawa? lf we don't, okay. But l would have preferred not to build runways for the enemy. Right! l'll smash those airfields with my own hands! March 23rd, a garrison about 300 kilometers to the east... ...on Daito lsland sent a wire: ''Enemy vessels spotted.'' There also was a wire from the main island's 44th lndependent Brigade... A fleet of U.S. vessels had been spotted off the Chinen Peninsula. The Division Commander of Shimajiri's 24th Division reported... ...a fleet of U.S. warships sighted south of the Kiya Cape, headed west. The dawn of the next day, the 24th, the battleships opened fire. Mommy... Mommy... Mommy... Mommy... Later that day, the Prefectural Office was moved to a cave at Shuri. Military Headquarters was also moved, to another huge cave below Shuri Castle. At 9:00 PM that night, 298 female student teachers and high school students... ...left to serve as volunteer nurses at Haebaru Army Hospital. The next day, the 25th, 285 male student teachers... ...graduated, and were immediately drafted. We, from this moment on, will be known as the Student Teacher Division of... ...the lron Blood Loyalist Troops, and will serve as Shields of the Emperor! We will deploy as follows: Sixteen at Headquarters. Fifty-six will serve as assault troops. One hundred forty-three will help build the defenses. Twenty-two will be the Chihaya squad. Who are you guys? Yes sir, we're the Chihaya squad, 22 of us. Headquarters sent us to serve at the lnformation Center. Okay. Go. Um, where is the lnformation Center? Go and look for it! Whoops, whoops, whoops... coming through. Here you go... Sorry! What do you want? Here it is! Reporting for duty, sir. Never mind that. l'm Captain Masunaga. l'm in charge of you Chihaya guys. Now that you're here, go find Air Force Staff Officer Jin for me. Repeating your order, sir! We will go find Air Force Staff Officer Jin. Um... where should we go? lf l knew that, l wouldn't be asking you to find him. And when you do, tell him we've got an urgent message for him! Yes sir! Barber, have you ever been in the Army? Yes sir, l was in New Guinea for a stint. l got wounded there. Well, l'm sorry to hear that. Well, l'm sorry to hear that. No, it's nothing. Do you have family? Do you have family? Huh? l had them run away north... ...l mean, they were transferred north. lt's a good thing you got them out. When the battleships cease fire, the enemy will land. Today's bombardment was mainly aimed at Chinen and Kiyan... Today's bombardment was mainly aimed at Chinen and Kiyan... ...but l see it as a purely diversionary tactic. lt'll be here, for sure... at Kadena. The bastards are going to land there, and cut across to isolate the north from the south. General, nine tokko planes have landed. So they've arrived! So they've arrived! lt's the Bukoku Unit. They were on their way from the Kanto base to Taiwan and decided to drop in. They couldn't get to Taiwan now anyway. We have to crush them! The enemy's right here! But they're on their way to another mission. But they're on their way to another mission. Send them in! Send them in! Yes sir. Send them in! Move it! Move it! A dawn attack... can you do it? Any time, if we're given orders. Here are your orders: The Bukoku Unit will depart at 5:30 AM for Kadena Harbor and attack the enemy fleet. They must be sunk. The Bukoku Unit will depart at 5:30 AM. We shall reach Kadena Harbor, attack the enemy fleet, and assuredly sink them. Early in the morning... we'll make our tokko attack. As always... ...just follow me. Got that?! Got that?! Yes sir! One plane got a hit! The second and third planes are making their runs. They did it for us. The fourth plane is...! The rest are going in. The enemy has landed on Kerama. What? On Kerama? Completely undetected, U.S. troops assaulted the Kerama lslands. At 9:00 AM, the U.S. Army landed on Tokashiki lsland. The third garrison withdrew to Hill 234. The third garrison withdrew to Hill 234. Keep going! Where will the civilians find shelter? The enemy will be attacking us here at the fort... ...so get them into the valley behind us. Yes sir. Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! The villagers are in danger. Please let them into the fort! They can't come in! Then just give me a gun and l'll shoot them all! No! Tell everyone that all civilians are to... Suicide... Having reached the end of their journey... ...all the villagers wished the Emperor ''Banzai,'' and prayed for victory. They made the tragic decision that they would rather laugh and die. Families and relatives huddled together in bunches. Twenty to thirty people gathered around each grenade. On the heels of the sound of exploding grenades... ...roaring, bizarre sounds echoed across the valley. The flesh of the old and young, the men and the women, was instantly rent asunder. Then was heard the hellish sound of agonizing screams. Those unlucky enough to survive struck each other with clubs. They used razor-blades to slit their own throats. They struck open the heads of loved ones with spades and swords. lt was a most horrifying spectacle. The crystalline streams of the valley ran red with blood. ln mere moments, 394 people gave up their lives. April 1st, early dawn. Okinawa was still asleep. U.S. ships began exchanging coded messages at 03:47 this morning. The message traffic is similar to the three hours preceding the invasion of lwo Jima. The probability of a major landing is very high. Chihaya squad! Take this to the lnformation Center! Kaya's unit reports heavy bombardment of Kadena beach started at 05:32. Operator! Operator! Yes sir. Yes sir. Send this to Headquarters: Yes sir. Send this to Headquarters: Send this to Headquarters: Yes sir. From the west beach of Kijima, we cannot see the color of the ocean for the U.S. ships! What?! Color of the ocean?! What does that mean?! lt's 30% ocean, 70% ships. Get it?! 30% ocean, 70% ships! They'll land right after they stop firing. Miyake... just so l'm clear on this. There are no other units near their landing zone, right? Okay! l know what to do! About 1500 landing craft placed four U.S. divisions ashore starting at 8:30 AM. Barber! Barber! Yes sir! Barber, at your service. How sharp is your razor? How sharp is your razor? Sir, it's well-honed. When the Americans come, l'll... When the Americans come, l'll... Good. Now give me a shave! What a waste... Sir? The enemy staff must be very happy; they've hit us at just the right time. But their soldiers are just tiptoeing around; they're afraid it's a trap. Why aren't we shooting at them? Now is the time for artillery! lt's too soon, we can't afford to waste shells. Besides, Air Force Staff Officer... ...where are our airplanes? How come we're missing this 1-in-1000 chance? Communications! Communications! Yes sir. Yes sir. Send a report to Headquarters. Yes sir. Send a report to Headquarters. Send a report to Headquarters. Yes sir. The U.S. Army has started coming ashore. They have huge numbers of men, well supplied. What's the 32nd Army doing? They're not doing anything. What...? U.S. War Correspondent Ernie Pyle wrote of this day... ...that the troops landed on Okinawa without wetting their shoes, as if it were a picnic. The G.l.s laughed, and said that Ushijima was either a great strategist... ...or a complete jackass. Stop bothering me with individual reports! Bring them to me all at once. Go get ready for a lantern parade! Yes sir. Yes sir. ''Lantern parade?'' What is this? A group of girls came to give us a hand. Give us a hand? They said the Army didn't invite them, so they came on their own. They were really going to go out and attack. Death to America! Death! Death! Death to America! The north airfield was captured even sooner than we expected. The defending troops were about to be annihilated, so they retreated. The central airfield is guarded by 170 students from the Prefectural School of Agriculture. That's bad, we can't have student troops out there. Nagano, make them retreat. The Navy cannon at Mount Heian was destroyed before we retreated. Also, 14 female soldiers from Chatan Village have committed suicide. And Kaya's troops? They haven't retreated a step since the enemy landed. They're bravely standing their ground. Kaya was ordered to blunt the enemy's advance... ...then fall back to the main fortifications. Maybe they should start retreating now... Kaya's a veteran, let's just let him have his head. Check that out. Hey, ''Shorty.'' Okinawans must defend Okinawa. Up to it? l am. You're going to charge holding a live bomb, you know! You're going to charge holding a live bomb, you know! Hey... you're really going to do it? Hey... you're really going to do it? Yes, really! Duck! Duck! Shorty! Shorty! Shorty! Captain, l did it. Shorty. Well done! Great work! Listen... l'll make this simple... They have to launch a big air attack at once! What's taking lmperial Headquarters so long?! What's taking lmperial Headquarters so long?! Should we cable Taiwan? Should we cable Taiwan? Of course! Should we cable Taiwan? This might be the Japanese Army's final battle. We must give it all we've got! Remember... A sword charge is not a suicide attack. Use your head. Yes sir. lt's my turn now. The 32nd Army is trying to save itself. They've done nothing to oppose the invasion... ...and now they're telling us to send in some planes. They're being far too passive, and selfish! Maybe we should blast them one to wake them up. Please look at this. What is it? To attain victory, the airfields have to be recaptured. That's what the 32nd has to do. Such orders must be sent to Okinawa. Wait. We've got a responsible commander out there. Therefore, lmperial Headquarters shouldn't meddle. That's my opinion anyway. That's my opinion anyway. But... An urgent request from the Navy. ''On April 6th, we will launch a general offensive against the Americans.'' ''Success depends on using Okinawa's North and Central airfields.'' lf we secure the airfields, the Navy is willing to give us their all. That's not possible. The Navy sees Okinawa as their battleground. ln other words, they want the Army to join the fight. We have telegrams from lmperial Headquarters and Taiwan. Here. ''Control of the North and Central airfields is, for the 32nd Army... ''...a vital strategic objective.'' ''The recent battle at lwo Jima is a clear example of this.'' They're giving us no respect! lt's interference! ''Destroying enemy air and naval assets is not just... ''...a fundamental goal of the Battle of Okinawa but also... ''...a crucial prerequisite for launching an air offensive.'' ''You must therefore be completely prepared to undertake this operation.'' They're telling us to go out and fight. They're giving us orders, as if we were common soldiers! Yakumaru! Yakumaru! Yes sir. Yes sir. Summon all staff officers! Yes sir. That's all of the demanding telegrams, but never mind them. What's essential is for us to assess the situation. The enemy isn't ready to attack us yet. They're still advancing on us. Their formations are still in disorder. So now is when we'll attack. Attack, with everything we've got! Our main force will mount a night attack, and sow havoc and confusion. We'll get them milling around in confusion. Once that's done, then we've got the advantage. The enemy won't be able to use their artillery or bombs. We'll destroy them in close combat, which is our specialty. That's it! l'd like to hear your opinions. l'm in agreement. We should take the offensive. l believe that the 32nd should obey the orders of lmperial Headquarters. On other islands, unsupported attrition tactics have had disastrous results. Therefore, l would recommend a combined air and ground assault here in Okinawa. But it's a question of our manpower vs. theirs; we're outnumbered five to one! We won't know what that means until we attack. l'm for attacking. Currently the 32nd Army is mostly unhurt? That's right. This is not a question of quantity of troops. Wrong. The quantity of troops is the key to everything. l am in disagreement with the General's opinion. Let's hear it. ln anticipation of the enemy landing in Kadena... ...we have spent months making preparations. Things have turned out just as we have anticipated... ...so if we now discard our plans in favor of a general offensive... ...in the face of their over- whelming numbers... ...we have no chance of success whatsoever. So, once the enemy forces have completed their landing... ...launching an attack on them would be suicidal. Fine... understood. We'll look to the General for the final decision. We'll reconvene in the Control Room in 30 minutes. l have decided that our main force will attack the North and Central airfields. Do your best. The safety of our Empire depends on the fighting spirit of the 32nd Army. Exert every effort to crush the enemy and defend our islands. At all costs, keep on the offensive; let there be no thought of retreat. lt's a general offensive! lt's a general offensive! A general offensive?! You got a grenade anywhere? What's going on? lt's a general offensive. Everybody's going! l'm going too. Oki Company will now fight under the banner of the 32nd, sir! Likewise for Tabuchi Company! We're departing for duty, sir! Be careful out there. Yes sir. Yes sir. General, all 2500 soldiers have now gone to battle. Those who remain are mostly... ...mechanics, old soldiers, young boys... ...and the squads of volunteer women. We have no way to help the Army any more. ''The lmperial Navy, fighting arm in arm with the Army... ''...will launch, against the enemy vessels surrounding the Okinawan lslands... ''...an all-out assault.'' ''This operation will decide whether our Empire will flourish or perish.'' We, the 5th Air Fleet, will deploy all the tokko planes we have... ...and implement Operation Kikusui; we are risking everything... ...but unless we fight a decisive battle now, our chance to win will never come again. The 1st Assault Fleet was due to sail on the 8th... ...to the Okinawan lslands and launch tokko attacks... ...and so was preparing for immediate deployment. Send a telegram to the Navy to stop the sortie of the Yamato. There's no way it can get past the enemy fleets. l am an Ensign aboard the Yamato. We depart at 16:00; this will be the final sortie of the Fleet. The arrow has been released from the bow. l am a lookout, which requires me to be constantly on the alert. l'm very lucky, as a newly recruited student soldier, to have this duty. An outline of the current operation is as follows: First, the entire fleet will charge forward. This will attract the attention of the U.S. Navy and Air Force... ...and thus provide targets for tokko attacks. lf we survive, we will thrust ourselves into the heart of the enemy. Then we become as Fire and Wind, and shell them until our ammo is spent. And if we still have any strength remaining... ...we shall join the infantry on land, and carry on the fight. Currently the enemy is advancing... ...to positions at Ojana, Ganiku, Uebaru, and Wauke. This means they're cutting the main island into two parts. Yahara, how are the preparations coming for the assault?! We've finished positioning the key troops. As for the 24th Division... l don't need to hear the details. All right, looking good. Our underground dragon will leap out and thrust northwards. This is going to be magnificent! General! Three aircraft carriers and a fleet of 50 U.S. ships are 150 km south, headed this way. What? What? Let's see. They'll be here in time for tomorrow's attack; if they land to our rear, we're doomed. We're canceling! We're canceling tomorrow's attack. Tomorrow is the day of our deaths, and it approaches all too fast. What will we die for? How will our deaths matter? What will be our reward? An Ensign, a graduate of the military academy, said: We die for our country... for the Emperor... isn't that enough? What more is there? A student recruit assertively responded: To die for our country, l understand that. But what will that accomplish? My death, my life, the defeat of the entire nation of Japan... ...l want to relate these things to something universal, something that has value. Ensign: That's just an excuse, useless and harmful quibbling. As tokko, you wear the chrysanthemum... ...you can die shouting ''Banzai,'' you should be happy! Student: That's not good enough for me, l need something more than that. One guy cried at my words. One guy bitterly resented them. One guy will never forget me. One guy will bring white gardenias to my grave. They are all one guy. lt won't be easy for them to leave their fortifications. Therefore, why don't we give the 32nd Army a nudge? Chief of Staff, send them a telegram. ''The cancellation of your assault will greatly affect our entire operation.'' ''Your assault shall therefore be launched... ''...on the night of April 8th.'' Sir... ...we must obey these orders; the 32nd's honor is at stake. Please redraw your plans. We will attack on the night of the 8th. At 12:20 PM, anti-aircraft radar detected three giant masses of airplanes. Like fog and rain above the ocean, they blocked out the sun. The presence of these aircraft meant that an attack was imminent. A great formation appeared from between the clouds, and dived towards us. ''Over 100 enemy planes, plunging toward us,'' screamed the Captain. And then he gave the order: ''Open fire!'' Around 2:00 PM, 100 enemy ships were seen approaching the Machinato shore. This puts them on the left flank of the 62nd Division. lf they land, our assault will not just be in jeopardy... ...but our forces will be devastated. We must call it off! Honor be damned! We're in this fix because... ...lmperial Headquarters withdrew the 9th Division from Okinawa. Cancel it! l'm going to go convince the General. A second wave of over 100 planes rained down fury from the heavens. As the second wave departed, the third wave attacked. Over 100 planes screamed in on the port beam. Five torpedoes struck the port side. The fourth wave of over 100 planes flew in on the port beam. Several more torpedoes struck the port side of the ship. The ship endured over 10 direct bomb hits on the aft section of the deck... ...crippling its ability to fight its tormenters; it was now defenseless. The fifth wave, 100 strong, made a sudden attack over the bow... ...followed by a sixth, a seventh, and an eighth wave. The colossal vessel lay dead in the water. Though the great ship remained afloat, it was now a sitting duck. You who are about to die, what have you accomplished with your life? lf there is something, speak of it. Have you nothing, then, to be proud of? Our life is short. lt is too short. l am too young. Forgive me. Don't let your heart break for me, don't let it be ripped out. l now know, full well, the misery of death. Enkan Pond's been hit! The second tunnel's been hit! The tunnel entrance has been blown apart! Don't waste your breath, it's useless. lt's Kamiyama lsland again tonight. They've got good aim. Ouch... Mom... l'm coming in. What is it? A message from the boat mechanics. They're going to assault Kamiyama lsland tonight. We failed. What?! Failed?! We got heavily shelled at the rallying point... ...and three of us were killed. We couldn't go through with it. Assholes! Once you go, don't you dare crawl back like cowards! l already told Headquarters that you were attacking tonight. Go! Yes sir! Come back again, and l'll kill you myself! Captain! Just shoot me. Captain. We can't return to our unit. lf we can't go back... lf we're going to die either way, we might as well go for it. Let's all die together on Kamiyama lsland. Captain! What are you doing? We're right in front of the enemy! lt's all right, Sergeant. l just wanted... ...those Headquarters bastards to know we're here! And now... let's do it! Currently, the U.S. Army is roughly on this line. Our artillery units have been lying low, but now l've got them massed there. And? What are the results? We've got them pinned down. The M-98 rockets are proving effective. The ''Ghost Rockets,'' huh? We used those suckers in Singapore. They're amazing. According to reports, many of the U.S. wounded are brain-damaged. Great! lsn't that good? How is the 62nd Division holding up? Let's just say that Shuri here is the goal-line. Rugby, huh? There's fierce combat around our bases along this line... ...from Machinato to Kakazu, the western and upper plains... ...the hills of Tanabaru, and Wauke on the eastern coast. But the 62nd Division is strong; they're standing their ground like veterans. Kakazu is the key position. lf this were rugby, it'd be the ball. lf they take it from us, Shuri will be threatened. SHOOT! CHARGE! ''Your hot blood courses passionately; pound your chest and be exultant.'' ''The full moon reflects on the surface of your sake; enjoy a moment of intoxication.'' ''We will conquer the sky of Okinawa. l shall go first, and you shall follow.'' The U.S. Army showed signs of weakness; the chances for victory were perhaps 70%. The Combined Fleet seized this opportunity and sortied every available airplane. They threw everything they had into ''Operation Heaven #1.'' But the Navy's doing it! Their tokko attacks are lethal! Let's do it too. Let's launch a lethal night assault! General, when l... What is it? When l see you, it calms me. ls that right? Perhaps that's my real job. The Staff Officers are better than me at strategy. So, what's your opinion?! ln the present circumstances, a night assault is impossible... ...as the front line is constantly shifting. An organized night attack is impossible. lt's because they're shifting that the time is right. Merge the 62nd and 24th Divisions, and let them attack tonight! The cost of the night attack was the loss of two battalions. Doctor! Doctor! You've come this far! Don't you die on me! Tourniquet. You call this a Hospital? l won't forget this, even after l die! Shut up! You shut up, moron! Hey, this guy's dead. Get the dead out of here. l'm in pain! Hurry it up! A bug just crawled in my ear. Ouch! Ouch! Take it out! Take it out! Prepare to ventilate! Start ventilating! One-a- two-a-three-a-four. We see the hill of Shuri Castle far away... ln the beautiful breeze of pine-scented wind... What's all this for? ln the beautiful breeze of pine-scented wind... ln the beautiful breeze of pine-scented wind... They said we'd all die... ln the beautiful breeze of pine-scented wind... ln the beautiful breeze of pine-scented wind... ...if the carbon dioxide builds up. ln the beautiful breeze of pine-scented wind... The roof stands high... This is our school where we learn... What are you doing? This is our school where we learn... This is our school where we learn... l want to be a nurse. Please let me help. This is our school where we learn... l want to be a nurse. Please let me help. l want to be a nurse. Please let me help. Friends, our beloved friends... Friends, our beloved friends... Okay. Hold his leg. Friends, our beloved friends... Friends, our beloved friends... Yes. Friends, our beloved friends... Friends, our beloved friends... The beautiful white lilies with noble aroma... Those are our flowers blooming in our heart... The most beautiful scent in the world... Please... water! Some water! Give me water! Here's the newspaper. Hey, lron Blood Loyalist. Sir? This proclaims victory after victory; it's nothing but lies. Get this out of here. Yes sir. ln my next life, l'm going to the fairytale land... ...of Hans Christian Andersen, and becoming the prince. l'm going to commune with the birds, the flowers, and trees. May there be eternal prosperity for the great Empire of Japan. lf things don't change... ...the 32nd Army will burn down like a candle, and get snuffed out. However, we still have the 24th Division, the 44th lndependent Brigade... ...and the Artillery regiments, all unharmed and intact. We must fight a decisive battle... ...and let the chips fall where they may. That's what l think. l am opposed. The enemy has an overwhelming advantage. lf we engage them in open combat... ...we'll easily lose five men for every one of theirs who falls. ln war, you don't know unless you try! Now is the time for calm judgment. We're missing our chance for victory! l'm opposed to a futile attack! Yahara... lf, here in Okinawa... ...we don't try to attack, even once... ...and we get defeated, how will we apologize to His Majesty? No... how will we apologize to Japan? We will apologize to no one. We won't have to. We're doing the best that we possibly can. War must be fought aggressively! Actively! We must seek life amidst death! That is the path to victory. So, to achieve that victory, we must give our all! Gas bomb! lt's a gas bomb! Calm down! Don't panic! lt's not a gas bomb! Return to your posts! Yahara... Please... Let's die together. The next attack... please support my plan. Send the following: ''Except for one division assigned...'' ''...to defend Oroku Naval Base, our forces are to merge with the Army.'' lt's absurd. They're asking us to join in their all-out attack. lmpossible. We have only one rifle to five men, two-three grenades each, and no automatic weapons. Message from the 32nd Army: ''Deploy four battalions immediately.'' What?! What?! l'll go. Huh? Organize the recruits into four battalions. Victory or defeat, neither concerns us. My friends say ramming a ship will be quite painful. As l go, l remember that l owe someone money. lf you are in a hurry to fly, sometimes you forget to urinate first. l feel alive again. 5:00 PM and 5:00 AM are my favorite times of the day. l wonder why they always stop bombing and shelling us at those times? lt's because even Americans need to take a piss. That's true. Hey mister? Mister Barber? Huh? lt is you. Oh... You're the Tinsmith's son. Yes... Kokuba. As part of the attack on May 4th, l'll be part of a sword charge... ...so l need to have someone be responsible for my bones. Sir, could l put your name down on the form? Sure. Sure, but hey... Hey, how old are you? Sixteen! Thank you. Sixteen... Sixteen... Before our big attack, l have a special request. Recently, we've had reports of civilians... ...aiding the enemy. This is a problem. Please be on watch for such unpatriotic people. l don't believe there are any such people among the villagers. No. There are spies, for certain. They've cut our phone lines... ...they go around saying ''Stop the war.'' They exist, all right. Who goes there?! Can you let me rest here for a while? Where did you come from?! What? Where did you come from?! l'm tired. Our school burned down. Civilians aren't allowed in the fortresses! On your way! What happened?! A spy! That guy gave the signal! Hold it! Hey. What do you think about this attack? Well... l wouldn't know. lt's a success. We're winning. Really? Two hundred of our guns have stopped defending and started attacking. But everything depends on what happens next. The 32nd Army's lto Battalion assaulted and occupied the Tanabaru hills. They destroyed an enemy supply dump! Good...! Well done, lto Battalion! General, they deserve a letter of commendation! Companies, form a defensive ring! Yes sir! Squad leader! Squad leader! Yes. Squad leader! Send a coded message to Regimental Headquarters! Everyone who knows the codes is dead. Then send it in the clear: Battalion is currently at Hill 154.9! Repeat: Battalion is currently at Hill 154.9! 2nd Company Commander... Oyama is dead! Understood. 2nd Company... ...will be lead by 2nd Lt. Kurata. Yes sir. l can't tell... ...can't tell what's going on in all that smoke. There. My soldiers! You've indeed fought well here in Okinawa! As your Commander, let me express my undying gratitude! Bandage. A rocket hit Cave #5! Students and patients are buried alive! Sawada! Sawada! Sawada! Sawada! Doctor, hang on. Doctor, hang on. Sawada. Doctor, hang on. Doctor! Doctor, it's Miss Takashiki. Hang on, Hiro... Hang on. Takashiki! Hiro...! Takashiki. Takashiki, hang in there. This is one heavy daikon! Next... No! Don't cut off my leg! Who'll marry me then?! You're leaving? l'm going to lmperial Headquarters to request help from the Air Force. l have the permission of our Commander. We'll be on our way! Left face... On my mark... Forward... ...March! Do your best! Do your best! Do your best! The 32nd Army is no longer an effective military unit. Such being the case, we should give up on Okinawa... ...and devote our efforts to the mainland; l believe this would be for the best. This is why the 32nd Army must hold the enemy as long as possible in Okinawa. l know... l know that l will die here in Shuri. l too thought that we would make our final stand here. But this isn't our last bastion; we still hold other positions. But this isn't our last bastion; we still hold other positions. lf we moved south and regrouped, the 32nd could fight on. l'll give you my gut feeling. l am... ...sick of this damn cave. Yahara... ...can't we die yet? lf we die now, we give up all chance of victory. l agree with Yahara. Chief of Staff. To the last man... To the last shaku and sun of Okinawa... ...let us fight on. l believe that this is the destiny of the 32nd. lmperial Headquarters resolved to fight a decisive mainland battle. Okinawa would receive no more reinforcements. The Giretsu Airborne Assault Force was to be the last to be sent. However, news of this reversal by Headquarters... ...somehow failed to reach the defenders of Okinawa. We could retreat to the Chinen or Kiyan Peninsulas. But Yonabaru, at the neck of the Chinen, has already fallen to the enemy. So it would be difficult to go there. l don't know for sure how many men we've got left... ...but let's say we've still got 50,000. What will our strategy be if we withdrew that many troops to the south? l'd like to hear the plans. We'll locate Headquarters in Mabuni... ...and fight with the Yaesu and Yoza Mountains as the linchpins of our front line. Excuse me, l'm Governor Shimada. l hear you are retreating to the Shimajiri district. We're not retreating, we're moving our Headquarters. This is a highly classified military briefing, please leave. lf the Shimajiri district becomes a battlefield... ...well, there are 300,000 civilian refugees there. l thought they were evacuated to the north. We had no transportation, so only 50,000 went north. Why did you send 300,000 people south? The people believed that since your Headquarters was in Shuri... ...that it would be safe to move south. Please evacuate them immediately. How can they get past the U.S. forces? There is no route that connects to the north. What are we going to do then? Mr. Shimada... We've decided on our course of action. The 62nd Division is against moving the Headquarters. The 62nd Division wants to die here. Our resources are almost exhausted... ...and we have no strength left to move and then begin fighting again! You Chiefs of Staff should know this. Also, several thousand of our injured... ...are here in the Shuri area. The Division cannot abandon them. We cannot leave our comrades-in-arms behind; we will not move from here! Also... ...thousands of our comrades have fallen. The 62nd will stay and protect the injured who cannot be moved... ...and join our fallen comrades in honorable gyokusai! The Division Commander strongly desires this. The people of Okinawa... trust the military. Thus they've gathered in the south of the island. lsn't there any way that you can save these 300,000 people? Please leave. Mr. Shimada. We soldiers, for the sake of Japan... ...have to do whatever we can to win this battle. Please understand. And l, as Governor... ...have to do whatever l can to save the people. You're not old enough to smoke, are you? No, l'll try it, this'll be my last chance. Anti-aircraft fire! Planes two and four have been hit! Shit! lt's shaking like l've had a stroke. l'd rather die than be crippled like that. Planes three and five have been hit too! Mr. Okuyuma, here we go! Hang on tight! Fly smoothly, Mr. Suwabe! Smoothly now! We're going in! We're going in! Yes sir! A moment later, the last plane pancaked onto the runway. Eight or nine fully armed soldiers jumped out of the plane. They spread out in eight directions... ...and began throwing grenades at the rows of U.S. planes. Seven attack and cargo planes went up in flames. ln addition, they destroyed a total of 26... ...bombers, fighters, and other attack planes. Six hundred drums containing 70,000 gallons of gasoline exploded into flames. The north airfield was put out of action until 8:00 AM of the 25th. After we relocate Headquarters, the military hospital will also move south. We'll take as much equipment as we possibly can. Patients who are not ambulatory will have to be left behind. Left behind...? We've been ordered to take the necessary measures. Necessary measures...? What's going to become of us? Hey student, take me with you! We fought for you! For your sake! Take me with you! Take me with you! Take me with you! Nurse, excuse me... What? Do you have a razor l could borrow? l got one, but what do you want it for? l need to shave. Oh, sure... Thank you. l'll give you a hand. Hurry up and go. Takashiki... okay, let's go. lt hurts! lt hurts! Relax. Relax. lt hurts! Relax. lt hurts! lt hurts! Be strong, we have to go. l can't. Doctor, l'm staying behind. What are you talking about! You can do it. lt hurts! Somebody give us a hand! We need to carry out a student! Please give us a hand! Please! Please! Sorry to trouble you... but, please dress me. Takashiki... l promise l'll come back for you. Yes. l'll wait for you. Doctor, please take care. T... Takashiki... Mom... Come on, hang on! Take me! Take me! Take me! Take me! Hey! l'm Sergeant Omori, from the lndependent Machine Gun Unit. Anybody know where my men are? lf you see them, you tell 'em, that Omori was crawling around in the mud. l won't die like this. They're leaving me here to die, but l won't go that easy. l'm not dying that easy! Sneaking off in the middle of the night, Mr. Barber? You can leave if you want. No sir. l'm coming along! Please let me go with you. Sir, the Chihaya squad will escort you. Now! Move! What are you guys? The 62nd Division. We heard... ...that some of our men were still at the hospital. Our guys... no, the enemy... how far have they gotten? Naha... and Yanabaru. lt's as if Shuri's being strangled. That Staff Officer was really moved, but he's got it all wrong, doesn't he? That hospital was like Hell. That's right, Hell. You're better off dead than writhing in agony there. That's what we told him... but he's a idiot! Let us die with you! Who is it? Who is it? The Giretsu Airborne Raiding Force. The Giretsu Airborne Raiding Force. Huh...? The Giretsu Airborne Raiding Force. So some of you guys made it. So some of you guys made it. We finally... got here... ...but it's too late... ...but it's too late... Asshole! Do you think our country can be defended by corpses?! ''Yasukuni Shrine:'' Tokyo shrine that commemorates Japan's war dead. The Yasukuni Shrine will become full only while the frontlines become empty! Please leave, we're blowing up the shelter. Calm down, you idiot. l gotta have a smoke first. Where were you born? ln Tokyo. Good, then l'll explain it so you'll understand. From here in Shuri to Kiyan... ...let's say you're walking along the Yamanote railway track... ...is the distance from Shinjuku to Shinagawa. Something like that. You can get there even if you're crawling. Go there, even if you have to crawl all the way! We've been ordered to retreat! Sergeant, please retreat! We can't retreat now, this is our big chance! You idiot! Fire! We hit it! This is going to be a battlefield, hurry and go to the Chinen Peninsula. Senior Staff Officer, did you see that? See what? See what? That lady was holding a baby's leg. Doctor Nakasone! Head nurse! Teacher! Teacher! l've got something for all of you. Look, cabbages! Wow! Doctor, have some. Oh, thanks. Glad you made it, sir. How is the General and the others? How is the General and the others? They got here about an hour ago. How far away is the enemy? They've invaded Naha and Shuri, and begun moving south. Where are our positions? What's the matter? Only 30,000 were able to retreat. What? Each battalion is down to about company strength. We're down to about 20% of what we started with. Not only that, the Oroku naval battalion, because of a communications error... ...have gone down to Maehira on their own. This weakens our left flank! General. Headquarters is telling us to return to Oroku. But the Army just wants to use the Navy as a shield. Let's go back to Oroku. lt was our mistake. lt was our mistake. But we've destroyed everything there; the fortifications and the artillery. We can rebuild what's been destroyed. Huh? As long as we have our fighting spirit, we can do it. The Navy strength lies in its spirit. Also, l refuse to fight... ...amidst non-combatant civilians. Then we will leave the nurses, cooks, and communications staff behind? Of course. The Governor would have reported the situation in Okinawa... ...had there been any way to do so. The 32nd Army has also admitted that it has no means of communication. Though the Governor has not asked me to do so... ...l cannot keep silent about the present situation. So on his behalf, l am writing this emergency report. Since the enemy invaded Okinawa... ...the Army and Navy have fought a defensive battle. They haven't had the resources to protect the civilian population. Nonetheless, the island's young people volunteered to man the defenses. Those who remained, the elderly, women, and children... ...have lost their homes and possessions to the bombs. They moved themselves to shelters, where they wouldn't hinder military operations. They wandered about amidst falling bombs, exposed to the elements... ...existing in a world of suffering and deprivation. General. l am sorry. l am sorry. What? What's happened? What? What's happened? We have women volunteers... What? What's happened? They must change their clothes. Otherwise, they'll catch colds. Young women served the Army by nursing, cooking, and even... ...carrying ammunition; some of them begged to be allowed to fight. Banzai! Pull them in! Hurry! Bastards! There was no reward for their service. As the battle drew towards its close... ...the natural terrain of the island of Okinawa... ...became twisted into a ravaged, scorched landscape. Thus did the people of Okinawa fight. ln the future, l request that they receive special considerations. Hey, you women! Get out of the shelter! Say something! This is no place for you. All villagers must leave the shelter. That's an order. Leave! We're not going to leave. This is our shelter. You're a soldier, aren't you? You're fighting the Americans, aren't you?! What? Why do you scurry from shelter to shelter? Why are you chasing us out?! Why do you want to keep hiding?! Don't let him cry, the enemy will hear. Take me... take me to the hospital, hurry! Are you just going to let me die? Dear, l'm sorry, but there's nothing we can do. Don't talk! One more word and l'll kill you! Well...? l have to pee! Are you scared or something? Just go do it inside. l can't, it's unsanitary! Then just squat right here and do it. Hey mister. Huh? How much for a cup of that water? 30-sen. Business is good, eh...? l'm risking my life. l should be charging 50-sen! Hey! Hang in there! Long live the Emperor! You idiot, you're barely scratched! Really...? Tokko Battalion #3 tenaciously kept on fighting. Halt! Who goes there?! Sir, l'm an lron Blood Loyalist! ''lron Blood''? Local High School students, sir. What's with the white flag? Please let me in. l'll explain. Captain! Bastard! You led the enemy here, didn't you? No! You're aiding the enemy by trying to get us to surrender! That's not true! Do you still dare to call yourself Japanese? You're wrong! Wrong... Finally, only five men were left in veteran Kaya's unit. Here. Captain, sir. Mom... Mother... Hurts! lt hurts! General... Governor Shimada is here. Well, hello there, Mr. Shimada. l'm heading off to Kunigami. l came to say farewell. l'm glad you came by. Please, come in. What's this? Bonito jerky... Please, have a snack. Thank you. l brought you a gift too, some sugarcane. Thank you. Hey, Yahara... Senior Staff Officer... l'm sick of this war of attrition. Please, sir! You're requesting an air strike at this late date? The 32nd is close to annihilation. Then annihilation is inevitable. Okinawa is the opening skirmish before the definitive mainland battle. But Okinawa is... There were two unforgivable mistakes made about Okinawa. The first... ...was the transfer of the 9th Division; that was the fault of lmperial Headquarters. And the other was the 32nd Army's neglect of air operations. That was an error made of your Commanders. Let's go! Speaking of these last three months of valorous fighting by all our soldiers... ...and of their diligence in their duty, they have nothing to regret... ...and indeed they should congratulate each other. However, now our swords are broken and our arrows have been exhausted. The army will soon meet its destiny. Communications between Headquarters and the battalions has been cut. All battalions will therefore be lead by their surviving senior officers. They are to fight to the very end, and live on in eternal glory. Yeah. Live on in eternal glory. Hey, all of you! You students have all been released from duty. Released? Released? How come? Orders from the Army. Orders from the Army. What will we do now?! lt's dangerous here, so we should get out while we can. Teachers and students are now released from duty. lf any of you want to fight alongside the Army... ...you can do so if you want to. As to what is best, and what you should do, l don't know. All of you, do what you want. Surgical Division #2 is hereby dissolved. Doctor... are you going to kill yourself? Don't be silly! These are vitamins. The Army has disbanded us, sir! What are we to do? What's going to happen to Okinawa? You must live...! For your own sakes! And you must live on... ...for the sake of Okinawa! You must live! The army told us to die! To die for Japan! And we believed them! We're up against the wall. Shouldn't the Staff Officers infiltrate the U.S. areas and engage in guerrilla warfare? We Staff Officers aren't commanders! We don't have to die here! Lt. General Ushijima gave missions to each of the Staff Officers... ...and therefore, they were forced to depart from Headquarters. l will take the lead. Everybody follow me! Farewell, General! Take care of yourselves! General! We shall be going before you. We shall be going before you. General! General! Farewell! General! Farewell! Farewell! General! Don't die on me after all this. Aren't you going too? Not yet. l don't know what will happen to them, but you'll manage to escape. Just don't be in a rush. lf your route should take a day, take three days to get there. Sir... That's right, Yahara. We need you to succeed. Yahara... We were always drinking together in Saigon, before the war... Remember the movie called ''The Blue Danube?'' Huh? We saw it at the cinema next to the Hotel Majestic. That was a beautiful movie. lf can swim, swim out. Hurry and come out. Walk along beach to harbor. Chief of Staff, sir. What is it? We've received a Letter of Commendation from lmperial Headquarters. What, a Letter of Commendation? Just the standard form letter, the same one they always send. L... Let me see that. General... General, isn't this great? One more thing. We got a report that U.S. General Buckner... ...was killed at Maezato. What? Buckner?! A Commendation, and Buckner, too! lt's nice to get presents. Tomorrow, on top of Mount Mabuni... ...we're committing seppuku, while we watch the 32nd make its final attack. Barber, l'm next after the General. Give me some! Give me some! l want to die too! You can't have any. Now, hurry up and go. Cowards! The familiar look of a row of Soushi Trees... We passed by through them many times... lt is so tough to leave here... The dreamlike good old days are gone... l do miss those days... ln the school where we studied... The enemy's coming! Everybody, come out. Men, come out naked. Women, hold white flags. Come out. lf not come out, throw in bomb. Gas bombs! Gas bombs! Get over here! Get over here! Teacher, l can't breathe! Teacher! Let's get out of here! Mother! Urinate and put it over your mouths! Mommy! Let's go to Daddy! We'll go to him... we'll go to him together. Don't give up! Come on! Hey! lt'll be impossible at the peak, so here will have to do.

We Okinawans... ...should fight to the very end. This is the end. The Commander is dead, it's all over. Hey, let's just stay here, okay? We can die later if we want, even after we get captured.

Yes! Really? Really? Yes! Honestly? Honestly? Yes! Okay. Then let's all die together. Huddle together. All you women leave! All of you leave! lf you don't leave, l'll cut you down! Your deaths would be pointless! Why? Why must you die?! Run! Mother... Chasing the rabbit into the mountains... ...fishing for small carp at the river.
