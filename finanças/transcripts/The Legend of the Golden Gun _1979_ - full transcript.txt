[WIND WHISTLING] [PIANO PLAYING FAINTLY] MAN: I'll see you and raise you five, Pat. [CLATTERING] MAN 2: Another beer, Maggie. [BOTTLES CLANKING] WOMAN: Belly up boys, drinks are on the house. Come on, step right up here to the bar. [MEN HOOTING AND WHISTLING] NARRATOR: Old bottles, time-stained pictures on the wall. A forgotten poker chip. All pieces to a Western puzzle, the puzzle of a legendary man. My name is Joshua Brown. I wrote his book. They called him... The Golden Gun. [♪♪♪] BROWN: The Golden Gun was a legend. This is his story. In 1863, the United States was a divided nation. War raged in the east as brother fought brother over the basic issue of man's freedom. In the West, the Civil War gave birth to a new kind of criminal. Pro-slavery outlaws tore through Kansas and Missouri, killing, looting and burning everything in their path. Their leader was William Quantrill. Somebody put a torch to that building! You, there! Where you going with that, boy? Well, I figured we could keep him. We don't keep nothing from these slave lovers, nothing we ain't gonna eat or spend! No survivors! Go on! What's after this? Lawrence. [♪♪♪] GOLDEN: ...just a little bog. She'll make the trip fine if you don't push her. MAN: I swear they understand you, Johnny. Well, it's just my tone of voice. It's more than that and you know it. Been around a long time, seen plenty, but I ain't never seen anyone as good with animals as you. Sure you don't want to take over the business? I can straighten it out with the bank today before we leave. There you go, Henry. Mom and Dad need me too much at the farm. The fact is, I kind of enjoy it there. Well, it's a shame Henry ain't more like you. I mean look at that, give him a toy stagecoach and he throws out the horses. Hates the critters. [LAUGHS] Plain to see he ain't gonna have much of a future in this here transportation business. Well, maybe he'll find something he likes in Detroit. It's been a pleasure knowing you, Bill. Have a safe trip. Thanks son, give my regards to your folks. I will. So long, Henry. Come on, Moonbeam, say goodbye to Lady and let's skeedaddle. Remember that boy, Henry. I got a feeling he's gonna make his mark on this world. [♪♪♪] GOLDEN: ♪ Moonbeam ♪ ♪ You light my day Brighter than the sun ♪ ♪ It seems that we could Almost run forever ♪ ♪ Wind-burned days And quiet nights ♪ ♪ Stars that shine But not as bright ♪ ♪ As moonbeams do ♪ ♪ No, Moonbeam ♪ ♪ You know I love you ♪ ♪ Never had a friend as close As you are ♪ ♪ Never had the time To reason why ♪ ♪ You gotta be the reason For me living, Beam ♪ ♪ And if reasons ain't enough We can fly ♪ ♪ Moonbeam, you send me Riding up to the stars ♪ ♪ Galloping past Mars And on forever ♪ ♪ Wind-burned days And quiet nights ♪ ♪ A sun that shines But not as bright ♪ ♪ As moonbeams do ♪ ♪ No, Moonbeam ♪ ♪ You know I love you ♪ ♪ You know I love you ♪ [WHINNIES] Easy, Beam, easy. Can you feel it? There's something wrong. The ranch! MAN: Come on, break it up! Hurry, Joe! No! Yahoo! It's the boy! No survivors! I want him dead! QUANTRILL: What's wrong with you? Hit him! Come on, Beam, go! He'll wanna tell! Go on after him! [GUNFIRE CONTINUES] Come on, Beam, you can do it. Reynolds, cut 'em off from the falls! Beam, come on! Come on! Come on, boy, come on! Have to try the North Ford. Hyah! Hyah! Come on. Yee-haw! Come on! Come on! [YELLING INDISTINCTLY] Go! Come on! Come on... Get him! Whoa! [NEIGHING] Easy, boy. Easy. Whoa. Whoa! Whoa. No survivors, boy. Get off the horse. I said get off. [NEIGHING] [SCREAMS] Ride 'em both off, now! Now we do the town. Come on! [MEN SHOUTING] [GAGS, COUGHS] Is you alive, man? Hey, is you alive? Doggone, master, dem sure was a nice pair of boots. Here, uh, let me help you up. Moonbeam. Where's Moonbeam? Don't know no Moonbeam, master. At least not one that ain't up in the sky. My horse... [COUGHS] Where is he? Moonbeam is your horse? Yeah... The cliff, we jumped. Then I guess he didn't jump far enough. That's just the way I found him, master. [♪♪♪] When Dad gave you to me, I was about the happiest kid in Kansas. You may not have been as fast as Taddish's gelding, but you were special. Such a good boy. I loved you. Wish I'd gone with you. No, Beam. No, that's not true. If I died there, wouldn't be anyone to get him. And I swear to Mom and Dad, to you and to God above me, I swear, I'll kill him. I'm going to kill that Quantrill. William Quantrill killed your entire family? I'm sorry. He killed most of mine too. Quantrill spotted us just outside Joplin, Missouri. I was the only one who got away. You a slave? Uh... Not anymore, and I plan to keep it that way. Name's Joshua Brown, you may call me Book. John Golden. Why were you doing that? You mean the, "Master, master," routine? No uniforms. You see, slave lovers and slave shooters look an awful lot alike to me. That's why those generals back east invented uniforms. Blue for lovers, gray for shooters. I don't have that advantage. Hey, come on. I'll help you get him covered. Thanks. BROWN: It took the rest of the day to bury John's horse. And as we worked together, I could sense that he was a special kind of man, someone bound for greatness. Like rabbit? Yeah. How'd you get him? I didn't hear a gun. A couple of rocks and some rawhide. What do you do, conk him over the head with it? Not exactly. See that stump over there? Pretend it's the real legs of a rabbit. Accurate to over 80 feet. Huh. What do you call it? It's a bolo. Cowboys in South America use them instead of lassos. Not hard to make and quite handy. You can catch something without hurting it. I like that. Where did you find out about this? A book. Read them all the time. Heh. Right. Try it... but, uh, watch where it lands. Not too fast now, it's all in the way you let it go. Ah, I missed. Not by much. I'd say you're a natural. I think I saw it land. [EXPLOSION IN DISTANCE] [♪♪♪] What is that? Lawrence. Quantrill. Gotta kill him, Book. I've got to stop him. Someone will John, someday. It's going to be me. Hey, hey, hey, listen. To want to kill Quantrill is one thing. To actually try and do something about it is quite another. It's suicide. That man is a fighter, one of the meanest and toughest around. Well, I can learn to be one too. And who's gonna teach you? Hey, don't look at me. I mean, I may know Shakespeare, Bacon and the Bible, but fighting is a subject I try my best to avoid. There's gotta be somebody. BROWN: Ever hear of Jim Hammer? The gunfighter who wears that white suit? That's chamois skin, actually. I was thinking about him last night. Heard there's a price on his head. Yep. $10,000. Don't let that throw you, he's a good man. They say he rides into trouble like an angel from heaven. [WIND WHISTLING] That white suit appears, gleaming in the sunlight. No one's tougher. No one's faster. He's the best shot alive. Hammer's killed men, all right, but it's always been for the good, for true justice, not the kind in the politicians' law books. He's a legend John, a legend, on the side of justice. Well, why are you telling me this? Because Hammer's the man to teach you, and I heard he's somewhere just west of here. Well, then we'll head west. No, you'll head west. I'm on my way north. Book, we can help each other. Into a lot of trouble. The last thing you need is to be caught with a runaway slave. And the last thing I need is a white boy to slow me down. Book-- Think about it. Ah, keep it. You learn to carry a spare. Thanks. You aren't gonna catch Jim Hammer on foot, you know... You know where you can get a horse? Well, there's only one place that sells them for free. Mustang Canyon. BROWN: John didn't know it, but his legend was just beginning. [HORSES NEIGHING] Easy, boy. [NEIGHING] My name's John Golden. You and me, we're gonna be friends. All right, I want you to trust me. I guess you know you're special. The fact is, I've never seen a horse like you. Let me ride you. No, easy, easy. It's okay boy, I ain't gonna hurt you. Easy, easy. Easy. Easy, boy. Gonna be fine. Easy. Easy. Gonna go for a little ride. Whoa. Keep running till you're good and pooped, because I ain't getting off. You can do this all day, because I ain't giving up. You hear me? You have got to be getting tired of all of this. I ain't getting off your back, you hear me? I ain't getting off. I swear I can hear you thinking. Whoa! [HORSE SNORTS] Hey... You're really something, you know that? Really something. Nice horse. How'd you get here? Walked. Quiet. Been watching you all day from up there. I believe this is yours. What do you want? Just to meet you. Been trying to get that buckskin for a couple of months now, won't have anything to do with me. Horses are keen to people, to what they're worth. If that horse just picked you as his master, I'm inclined to trust his judgment. I'd like you to count me as a friend. J.R. Swackhammer is the name. John Golden. Well, he sure do dance pretty. Got a name? Well, he do now. Think I'll call him Dancer. Quantrill... must be one mean fellow. One dead fellow when I get him. All I've got to do is find Jim Hammer. The gunfighter? I heard he's just as bad as Quantrill, maybe worse. What do you want with him? Well, he's gonna be my teacher, teach me how to fight. They say he's the best around. Maybe so, but that strikes me as a pretty dangerous proposition. $10,000 on a man's head, he's a killer. Don't mean a thing. Hammer's a good man. Every gunfight he's fought has been on the side of true justice. [CHUCKLES] You don't say? It's true. Well, even if it is... What makes you so sure he would want to help you? Because I think I'm on the side of true justice too. I guess you are. But you're not gonna find him traipsing around the countryside. He's wanted. Nobody's gonna find him unless he wants them to. Then what do I do? Well, stay here. Hammer comes through every now and again to pick out a fresh mustang and have me... Have you what? You promise to keep your trap shut? Yeah, I promise. To have me work on his guns. I make all of his weapons. You're kidding? No. In the meantime, while you're waiting... we could work out a deal. You help me in my work and I'll teach you everything I know. What do you mean, about fighting? I'm a professional gunsmith, boy. Can't help but know a thing or two about using 'em. Well...? Are you sure Hammer will show up? Son, you can count on it. [♪♪♪] Five days, Dancer. Five days. I must have been a grade-A ruby sucker for this. "Work for me, son, and I'll teach you how to fight." Yeah. I'm getting fed up. Plain fed up. J.R.: John! "John." Need some lead. "Need some lead." Yeah, I'll get you some lead. [DANCER NEIGHS] Give it here. J.R., I've been here five days, breaking my behind. I'm getting fed up. You're supposed to be teaching me how to fight. That is, if you even know how to fight, which I'm beginning to doubt. When you gonna start holding up to your end of the deal? When do I get my first lesson? Huh? You just did. What's that supposed to mean? It means you had a lesson in patience. You gotta have patience to be a good fighter, to know when the time is right. You waited five days to lose your temper, that's good. Any less than four, I'd have figured you a hothead. More than six, a coward. You just passed with flying colors. I just finished this yesterday. What do you say we give it a try? [♪♪♪] Not bad. Let's try a few in the air. Ready? What's the matter? How can I shoot it if I can't even see it? You're throwing them into the sun. Instinct. Instinct? Quantrill ain't gonna sit on a log. You got instincts, use 'em. Show me. Fast as you can throw 'em. Instinct. [♪♪♪] Well, I'd say you came up here before sunset last night... then, uh... you plumb disappeared. Trail stops. Now, you know I had to go somewhere. Yeah, but you didn't leave any signs. That's right. Well, how am I supposed to track you? Instinct. You got a rare talent, but you're not letting yourself use it. You gotta feel for life, boy. Don't fight it, let it lead you. I bet Jim Hammer don't count on instincts. I bet you're wrong. Look, you've been up here a long time. I've got some guns that need selling, and our supplies are getting low. Why don't you and Dancer run into Junction City and pick up a few things. What if Hammer shows up? I'll keep him. Don't you worry, I'll keep him. MAN: Junction City, end of the line. WOMAN: Is it true we were carrying gold, Mr. Coaty? That's what I heard, ma'am. Yes, I guess it's not every train that's gets escorted by General Custer. Shane. MAN: You men... WOMAN: Sally, get the wardrobe. Yes, General. Have Loewen and his column disguise the wagons, then delay for 24 hours. If we're not back by then, have him follow the stagecoach west. Sir, are you sure the gold's gonna be safe? Hang the gold. If I manage to capture a war criminal out here, one with $5000 on his head, General George Armstrong Custer will be on the cover of every magazine from here to Boston. That ought to get Grant's goat. Carry on. Yes, sir. WOMAN 2: Excuse me. Would you be kind enough to help me? Yes, ma'am. I'm looking for the post office. The, uh... The general store... Uh, center of town. Thank you. Heh. Any time. [EXHALES] CUSTER: Boy! Boy! I was talking to you, boy. Name's George Armstrong Custer. I suppose you've heard of me. No, sir. You been out in those hills? About six months now. I wonder if you've run across this man. QUANTRILL: No survivors! Well? No, sir. I wish I had. He killed both my parents. Killed lots of people. $5000, highest bounty in the country. Except for Jim Hammer. Are you sure Quantrill's out here? Son, I'm famous for my intelligence reports. Then I'd like to ride with you. Don't be ridiculous. Now, be on your way. But I'm pretty good with a gun and I got my own horse here. I've got too much to do without worrying about a greenhorn kid. Now, be on your way. Forward, ho! [♪♪♪] Where in thunder do you think you're going? Supplies are all there. Got some mail too. That wasn't the question. To get Quantrill. I heard in town he's somewhere in these hills. And you're fool enough to go after him? I can fight now. Not good enough! Oh, you can take on the town tough, maybe outshoot the sheriff, but there ain't no way you can take on Quantrill. I think you're wrong. William Quantrill's got instincts you never dreamed of, boy, and that's what you got to have to beat him. You remember your first lesson had to do with patience? The patience to wait until the time is right. Johnny, you're not ready. Give yourself a month, maybe two, to develop. You go out there now all hotheaded and bent on revenge, sure as I'm standing here, you're a dead man. If you had your way, I'd never leave here. You don't think I got you figured out? You're just a lonely old cowboy who wants some company, J.R. That's it, plain and simple. Son? No! Don't sweet talk me. The time's right. Quantrill's out in those hills and I'm gonna get him. Come on, boy. [CRICKETS CHIRPING, MEN CHATTERING] CUSTER: This gold detail is just one of Grant's schemes to keep me out of the Shenandoah. He's jealous of my popularity. I want that photographer Yushika to get my picture with the outlaw. That ought to get Grant's goat. Yes, sir. Now, about the stage... Go mind the stage. We'll catch up in Salina, is that clear? Yes, sir. Wonder who that is. That boy from Junction City. Boy, I thought I told you I didn't want to see you around here. I ain't following you, General. I'm tracking William Quantrill. Come on, Dance. I hate to tell you, boy, but you're headed in the wrong direction. Only tracks going that way are from a horse with a broken hoof. [♪♪♪] Cavalries take the bait? Like a mongoose chase. They're two, maybe three miles behind. All right. QUANTRILL: There's Custer's gold. Right on time. Hyah! [♪♪♪] [ALL WHOOPING AND HOLLERING] Quantrill. Come on, Dance. Guess it's up to you and me. Come on, Dancer! Come on! [GUNFIRE] Mr. Cody, what's going on? We're being robbed, ma'am. Hang on. Stay where you are! Come here! Dang. Ain't nobody does that to Buffalo Bill. What do you want? WOMAN: Leave me alone! No! Quiet! You're dead, boy! [YELLS] Hammer! Hold! Whoa, there! Whoa! Hold! Hold it! [TRUMPETS SOUNDING; HORSES APPROACHING] So we finally meet, Hammer. No! [GUNFIRE] Stay away from him, boy. That outlaw's mine! Let's get him, damn it! He's getting away. [TRUMPETS SOUNDING] MAN: Any luck, General? Lost them in the hills. Damn it! Well, we'll settle in Salina till we catch them. CUSTER: Soldier? Yes, sir? How much gold did they get? Four strongboxes, sir. About $160,000 worth. They'd have gotten the stage, too, if it hadn't been for him. If it hadn't been for him, we would have caught them. You make sure that goes in the dispatch. Yes, sir. Form it up. Don't let him bother you. You were wonderful. I guess losing that much gold is gonna be hard on his reputation. Where is it all going? I heard them mention Denver. Kind of like sending coals to Newcastle. You going there too? To see my father. First time in 10 years. That man stole the locket he gave me. He stole a lot more than that from me. It seems like they always take the things that mean the most. What is it? He was right. I wasn't ready. I don't understand. I guess you don't have to. Will you be riding with us to Salina? No, I've still got some things to do around here. Important things. I guess that's the way it is out here. You meet someone you like, and then never see them again. Please, take care. You were right, J.R. I wasn't ready. I followed Jim Hammer's tracks back here. Is he gone? I...reckon he's... somewhere nearby. [GRUNTS] J.R.! Oh, I'm gonna be fine. A bullet went clean through my shoulder. It's just a little weak, is all. Why didn't you tell me? Oh, some things are just best left in the past. I'm getting old. Ain't much Jim Hammer left in me. Enough to save my life. I guess. Enough to sharpen up your instincts, if you want to try. I don't want nothing more in the world. Can you feel it? That's because you're open to it now. Trees, grass, animals. Everything. Everybody has it. What you're looking for... is the change. Boy, you've got real possibilities. [♪♪♪] [NEIGHS] [WIND WHISTLING; CHIMES TINKLING] You're ready, boy. Better than I ever was. Come on. There's something I want to give you. [♪♪♪] It always meant something pure to me. Something against evil. That's why I wore it. Try the gun. Empty it. I said empty it. Seven shots. Evil has its way of tipping the odds in its favor sometimes, best to make your own. That seventh bullet is for evil. For Quantrill. No. You didn't stumble on me by accident, Johnny. It was fate, destiny. Quantrill's only a small part of what you've got ahead of you. I didn't train you to go out there bent on revenge and kill him. I trained you to carry out a quest, to fight against evil and injustice. Go out there and ride as a savior, not some cheap kind of killer. You understand? I reckon I do. Then go out and do it. You tell Custer I'm dead. My suits and guns should prove it. Then go to Colorado. Why? Mm. Read it. Here. El Dorado Springs? You own a gold mine? Half. Gave my friend Jake Powell the money to start it. Finally struck it rich. Read more, my handwriting. Ahem. "Jake, I'm on my last legs "and hereby give this man, John Golden, my share of the mine." [METALLIC JINGLING] I know this ain't much, but it's all I got to give you. I don't know, J.R. Yes, you do. And if you've got any questions, ask 'em. Like the trees and the wind, you'll be able to feel me. I'll always be there. You're a rich man, Johnny, with your whole life ahead of you. Do us proud. Be strong, Johnny... and don't look back. Don't ever look back. [DOG BARKING] Hey, Joe, looky there. Think it's Hammer? Got to be. Gonna be some busy day. Who? Send him in. Where did you get that suit? Jim Hammer. He's dead. Where's the body? Coyotes got it. You don't expect me to give you $10,000 and make you into some kind of a hero because you've got his suit and gun, do you, boy? That's no proof. Don't matter. [HOLSTERS GUN] Wasn't looking for the reward anyway. Good day. Wait a minute. You say... you don't want the reward? I don't have much use for that kind of money. And I sure don't want the reputation. Uh, let me take a look at that suit. No doubt about it. Dean! Send a wire to Washington. "General George Armstrong Custer is pleased to announce the death of Jim Hammer." That ought to get Grant's goat. I suppose you heard that I captured one of Quantrill's men? No, sir. Black fellow. Caught him trying to pawn off some of that gold. He's black? Mm-hmm. We're hanging him this morning. You're welcome to watch. Quantrill wouldn't ride with a black man, General. Against his principles. Wartime principles don't amount to a hill of beans, boy, not once it's over. Remember that. SMALL FEMALE CHORUS: ♪ Sowing in the morning ♪ ♪ Sowing seeds of kindness ♪ ♪ Sowing in the noontime ♪ ♪ And the dewing eve... ♪ MAN: Yes, sir, yes, sir. Step up, ladies and gentlemen. Step right up. Introducing to you, Doctor Wheeler's Famous, uh, Blue Nectar. My latest concoction, guaranteed to prolong your life. It sweetens the breath, it's good in the bath, perfect for hangings, weddings, births and ceremonies of all kinds. Now, this bottle here sold for two dollars in Chicago, three dollars in St. Louis, but right here, right here, I'm selling these bottles of Famous Blue Nectar for only one dollar, one dollar a bottle... Never knew killing a man could be this much fun, Dancer. Sure don't say much for the human race. [CROWD CHEERING] Ladies and gentlemen, a great American, General Custer! General Custer, ladies and gentlemen! CHOIR: ♪ We shall come rejoicing ♪ ♪ Bringing in the sheaves ♪ [CROWD CHEERING] [CROWD QUIETS] Before we hang this thief, I'd like to say, I shall return with Quantrill... and his murderous gang of outlaws... and rid Kansas and the United States of America of them forever! [CHEERING] Until that day, these proceedings are closed. [CROWD CHEERS] Custer, that's not your man! Stop! That man's innocent! Go, Dancer! Get him! Get that man! Stop him! CUSTER: Let's go, men! BROWN: Guess we's lost them for now. I want to tell you, master, that was some mighty fine shooting back there. I's not your master, Book. I is, however, even. Johnny! [LAUGHS] Reckon one life saved deserves another. Hey, I told you to find Jim Hammer, not become him. I'll tell you all about it. Now, suppose you show me where you found that gold? Right. BROWN: For herein, Fortune showed herself more kind than was her custom. Paraphrase Shakespeare. [LAUGHS] Came upon it trying to bolo a jackrabbit. Four strongboxes of 24 karat fine. Oh! Figured I was set, for life. Yeah, and some. Well, I knew, I knew I couldn't get rid of the bars, so I melted one of them into nuggets and tried to sell it in town. Where Custer nabbed you for one of the outlaws? Can you believe that? Me, with old silver teeth? I told the general what had happened, brought him up here and it was gone. Custer thought I was lying to protect Quantrill. Any trace of who took it? It got up and flew away. [VOICE ECHOES] My ending... is despair. [WIND WHISTLING] You all right, John? They went west. West. Mm-hmm. [CHUCKLES] How do you know? Instinct. Come on, let's go. BROWN: And so we followed John's instincts west, toward the Rocky Mountains and the gold mine John inherited from Hammer. Custer trailed us most of the way, which, uh, put a strain on Dancer. It wasn't until the foothills before we found a good horse for me, a pinto from the Ogallala tribe. John said he was as tame as mother's milk. I knew better. Whoa there. Easy now, boy. John, what should I do now? Talk to him. What should I say? Something soothing. Say, uh... say, "Attaboy." Attaboy. [LAUGHS] Like you mean it. Attaboy. A-- Attaboy. How much farther is it to the mine? Well, man in town said just up at the end of the canyon. Can't be too far. Well, you're not sitting in my saddle. [JOHN LAUGHS] What are you gonna call him? Attaboy. Well, I guess that fits. BROWN: It was a mercifully short ride to the end of the canyon, but when I saw what was there to greet us, I wished it had been considerably longer. The tall canyon walls were crawling with armed guards. I don't know about John's instincts, but my instincts told me that this was not a friendly mine. Sure you want to own half of this? MAN: Hey, there. You gentlemen are trespassing on private property. Name's Harrison Harding, I'm the sheriff and the judge for this territory. John Golden, and this here's Joshua Brown. Guess you kind of got a hold on the law around here. Which brings me to my next question. Don't you know trespassing's against the law? I reckon I do, but as Jim Hammer gave me his share of the mine, guess I'm in my bounds. I'm afraid you got your signals crossed, sweets. Uh, Jake Powell sold out to me, uh, three weeks ago. Sold out? Hammer's share, too, when he found out Hammer was dead. I don't understand. Powell just struck it rich. Can't argue that. The El Dorado's pulling in close to $2000 a day now. But, uh, 20 years in the same mine can, uh, do things to your head. I guess Jake just couldn't take it anymore. BROWN: He sold everything he'd worked for? HARDING: Stranger things have happened. [WIND WHISTLING; CHIMES TINKLING] Know where he went? I heard Boulder. Well, I guess that's where we'll be headed. Judge Harding. Well? Says Hammer gave him his share. Could be trouble. You're the law, you can handle it. [LAUGHS] Looks good, don't it? I mean, you'd never know that yesterday this was United States Treasury, 24 karat fine. We've got to start mining for real, Quantrill. Somebody's going to catch on. We will be mining. Just as soon as the rest of the El Dorado's ours. WHEELER: That's right. Step up, ladies and gentlemen. Step right up. Introducing to you, Doctor... Doctor Wheeler's Famous, uh, Blue Nectar! My latest concoction, guaranteed to... ...weddings, births and ceremonies of all kinds. Now, this bottle here sold for two dollars in Chicago, three dollars in St. Louis, but right here, right here, I'm selling these bottles of Famous Blue Nectar for only one dollar. One dollar a bottle. Who'll step right up and pick up a bottle? And I have here a cure... MAN: Whoo-hoo! [FIREWORKS EXPLODING] WHEELER: Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Step up, ladies and gentlemen, step right up. Introducing to you, Doctor Wheeler's Famous, uh, Blue Nectar, my latest concoction-- guaranteed to... [EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE] BROWN: Attaboy, don't get too excited, now. [FIREWORKS EXPLODING, CROWD CHEERING] You know, I been thinking. For a mine that's producing 2000 a day, it sure was quiet. I didn't see one single man loading ore. Quantrill's behind it. He was back there. How do you know? Instinct can tell you that? Yeah, but Hammer taught me a lesson I ain't gonna forget. What was that? It had to do with timing, and then was not the time to take him or those fellows on. I agree. So... where do we find Jake Powell on the Fourth of July? Well, if I was a gambling man, I'd wager somewhere inside a local bar. [PIANO PLAYING] MAN: Another beer, Maggie. I'll see you and raise you five, Pat. [MUSIC CUTS OFF] [WIND WHISTLING] BROWN: I didn't think John could believe his eyes. There in Maggie's Saloon were some of the biggest legends in the West. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Wyatt Earp, up from Tombstone. Even old Jim Hammer had his picture on the wall. And there by the bar was John's old friend, Buffalo Bill Cody. He was drinking with an Indian chief in a top hat, Sitting Bull. They were all staring at him, waiting. That's a mighty big... suit you're trying to fill, stranger. Belonged to a good man. Can't argue that. You steal it? He gave it to me. Well, then let's see if you're good enough to deserve it. Got some chips, Wyatt? One dollar chips would have done just as well. Okay, cowboy, show us your stuff. [PEOPLE GASP] Once is not enough. Cowboy, I like your style. [PIANO RESUMES PLAYING] Seven. He even gave you his gun? Yes, ma'am. Jim said the seventh one's for evil. Maggie Oakley. Jim Hammer was a... dear friend. John Golden, and this here's Book Brown. Book? We're looking for Jake Powell, used to own the El Dorado with Jim. And then Harding moved in. That crook never would have gone near that mine if Jim was still alive. Jake was here tonight, left about two. You can probably find him passed out somewhere nearby. Thanks. Any time. John? Jim was pretty special to me. Don't know if he told you or not, but we have a child, a little girl named Annie. You take care of yourself, huh? Yes, ma'am. I will. You play cards? Can I throw a bolo? Look, those men look awful tough. Ripe for picking, pocket and brain. Maybe I can find out something about Harding. As long as I plays like I's, uh, stupid and treats them like they's smart, well, then they ain't gonna care what I ask or how I plays, and that's a fact. You be careful. Yes, sir, master. You knows I will. But General-- All right, up and at 'em. The fifth of July is not a holiday. [WOMAN SHRIEKS] Put that man on the report. But General-- I don't care how drunk or how tired or how woman-starved these troops are, Captain. I've chased those men across two states and I'm not going to let them get away today. Unh! I want the full troop armed and mounted by 4 a.m. Yes, sir. [♪♪♪] BROWN: It was dark by the time John found Jake Powell, and sure enough, he was passed out in an alley just like Maggie said. Once Jake got over the shock of seeing John in Jim Hammer's clothing, they talked about the mine. Harding had pressured Jake to sell out, but was only able to get Hammer's half of the mine. Jake, it turned out, had already put his half in a trust for his daughter. Nobody can touch it, not even me. Only my daughter in Philadelphia, and only when she turns 21. [ROOSTER CROWS] Which, if that's the sun coming up over there, happens to be today. But you signed Jim's half away? I'm sorry, son, but I had to. Right after Jim died, Harding rode up to the mine and showed me this. Solid gold. I sent it to my daughter after the El Dorado came in. You see, Harding had been tracking my daughter in Philadelphia, this was the proof. He said he'd have this man kill my daughter if I didn't sign my mine over to him. I'm sorry, son, but I had to. Today your daughter inherits her half? Yeah, but she's safe in Philly. Afraid not, Jake. This girl was headed here. QUANTRILL [ECHOING]: ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Sarah ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Good morning, darling. Today is the day when you and the judge here are officially partners. And to celebrate the occasion, we thought we'd give you a little look at your mine. [♪♪♪] [WATER SPLASHES] Your father spent the best part of five years digging that. It's a long ways down. You wouldn't. There's plenty of things we'd do for this mine, sweets. Why don't you make this thing a whole lot easier on yourself, huh? All you've got to do is sign your half over. And then you can go back to Philly and pretend like the whole thing never happened. Think about it. Think about it real hard. [QUANTRILL LAUGHS EVILLY] Okay, boys, rise and shine. The light has dawned. I just don't know how I's so lucky. Gotta go, Book. Don't be crazy, I'm hot. It's 6:00 in the morning, we gotta go. I'll be back soon. Don't worry. Miss Maggie, would you please takes care of my winnings? I certainly will. What's the matter with you? Book Brown, Jake Powell. We gotta get back to the mine. I think they've got Jake's daughter. I bet they've got some stolen gold too. Word on the range is that someone's out here trying to fence a load of 24 karat fine. Quantrill. I'll bet they dirty it up and sell it as ore. Come on. Good morning, gentlemen. You... are under arrest. [♪♪♪] No use trying to get away, I think that's plain to see. You boys coming or not? On one condition. You gotta let us take you to the El Dorado mine. There's a girl there who's in trouble. And I think you just might find your stolen gold. [LAUGHS] Don't try to play me for a fool, boy. I've already trusted you one time too many. Let's go. Yes, sir. Guess we will. Go, Book! CUSTER: Get them! The horses are out back. Come on, boys! Let's get up for the kid! MAGGIE: Come on, let's get that guy. Get 'em, boys! MAGGIE: Come on, Butch! I swear, I'll get you for this, brave man. I'll get you! Where's Jake? Jake! Hey! Come on. Let's go. Where? Down there. Oh, no. Come on. Whoa, Attaboy. Easy, now. Whoa! Attaboy! After them, you jackasses! QUANTRILL: I'm not a man to take lightly. It's a long fall. Sign over your half and you can walk out of here alive. One minute, one strand. They ain't gonna last forever. BROWN: Twelve. They're Harding's men. POWELL: Any ideas, John? I guess we'll just have to run the gauntlet. Uh, I remember you saying something about a right time and a wrong time to take on these guys? Reckon I did. Well... There's times you just don't have a choice. Let's go. QUANTRILL: This'll be our mine, one way or another. All right! I'll sign. [GUNFIRE] Ho! Is that gunfire ahead? Yes, sir. We ride to the sound of gunfire. Yes, sir. Sound the charge. Ho! [TRUMPET SOUNDING] Sign it! Ha! There, you got what you wanted. Are you satisfied? Satisfied? Well, not quite. See, I have a policy that keeps things under control. No survivors. No! [GUNSHOT] Guess that rope's thin enough, Quantrill. Now move her away from that hole. Get him! John! [PANTING] You okay? I'm fine. I knew you'd come. Well... Well, I guess we'd better get you untied. Hands behind your back. Keep still, gentlemen. Daddy! Sarah! [TRUMPETS SOUNDING] CUSTER: Forward, men! Hold! [♪♪♪] WOMAN: It's General Custer. MAN: Yay, General! MAN 2: General Custer for president. WOMAN 2: We're behind you all the way, General. I don't understand how you could let him do that. You're the one who should be getting the credit. I figure the credit isn't what really counts. It's the doing that makes the difference. BROWN: Well, if it isn't the Golden Gun. Who? You heard it. Maggie done give you a name. Maggie? Well, how do you think Buffalo Bill, the Sundance Kid and Wild Bill Hickock got their names? But, uh, I don't know if I'd want to be known for my gun. Come here. I thought you knew better, Johnny. It's how you use the gun that counts. Jim Hammer was known for his gun and there's more Jim Hammer in you than any man alive. I can see it in your eyes, feel it when you walk into the room. You're special. And you'll use your gun for justice, just like he did. Now sign it. Thanks, Johnny. [PATRONS CLAPPING] Yahoo! Son, Sarah and me want you should have this. The gun's already mine. But I appreciate it. Wondered where it went. Take a look at it. Now the gun fits the name, 14 karat plate. Figured if you ain't going to stick around and enjoy the mine, you might as well take a little piece of it with you. [SNICKERS] It's real pretty. Thanks. Mmph. Golden seven gun. If you're gonna be a legend, John, you, uh, might as well get used to it. I reckon I ain't gonna be much of anything if we don't hit the road. Mm. Thanks, Maggie. [SIGHS] You have to go? It's bigger than me or you. It's what I've gotta do with my life. I hope you'll be back. From time to time. You and me are partners in the El Dorado. Don't want you walking away with my share of the mine. [CHUCKLES] [♪♪♪] Bye, Johnny. Book... Let's go. BROWN: We rode out of Boulder feeling good that day, anxious to face the adventure, the danger that was ahead. With John's sense of purpose, our destiny was overwhelming. It controlled his life. It was the legacy that Jim Hammer passed on. HAMMER: I trained you to carry out a quest. To fight against evil and injustice. Go out there and ride as a savior, not some cheap kind of killer. You understand? GOLDEN: Reckon I do. JOHN: Then go out and do it. Do us proud. [♪♪♪]
