I'm sorry I can't even think straight. You know Chris and Rick are working their asses off right now, trying to get us ready for tomorrow. You know what, but that's not my problem... it's your problem! Jeff? Jeff? You know it was my problem earlier today, I had to clean up a bunch of freaking comics that were strewn all over the theater, and I had to find people clean it up. You know what! That was my problem, and you know what else is my problem, is when they run around this freaking booth like its a freaking playground. Alright, I'll have my girlfriend watch the, alright, goodbye. Listen, listen. OK I have to pull an all nighter. OK. OK. I can't watch the kids though. Urn, I don't think you understand, I'm going to lose my job, and I need somebody here to watch them when the wake up. Look, I would love to but I can't, I just can't. I've got to work in the morning. I'm really, really sorry. - I would love to watch the kids. - I'll be right back. Lenny? Where you going? - Yeah! - Jake. Listen, um, I need you to watch my kids tomorrow morning man, it's a real emergency, OK? No way. Listen to me Jake, please. This is a dire situation OK, - I'm going to lose my job. - Sorry, no way. Is there anyway I can twist your arm man. Come here, quick. Come. Leni. Goddamn it! Listen, here's what we're gonna do. - You see one of these? - Yeah. Sure. I take these when I want to sleep through the garbage trucks in the morning and just get an extra three hours rest, okay. - So we divide this up. - Okay. Give the kids a third each, and then we're good to go. I don't know if that's a good idea, their just little kids, I don't know. Listen to me, what's a worse idea is if they wake up and nobody's here. Do you understand that okay. They're gonna freak the fuck out. This is a sedative. - It's cool. - Okay. Check it out, you see that? That's like an eighth of a pill. Okay, I think there may be a little bit too much in there. Alright, come on. Come on! Alright buddy. OK, go back to sleep, go back to sleep. Alright buddy. Lenny! Alright buddy. Alright guys. Let's do it. Come one. Up. Up! I know you guys can hear me, come on. Alright. One... two... three. Come on. Come on, I'm serious. Crunch! Crack! Come on guys. Guys come on. Come on! - Stephen! Holy shit. - Where are they? They're right over here. They've just been out like this for the past... Listen man, you know, I take one of these pills when I want to sleep for an extra two hours, you know. Are you sure you only gave them an eighth? I chopped up a little bit... It was not more than that, it was a pinch! I'm telling you a whole one knocks a full grown man out for two hours! You got to back off. Here, that was it, this is... Is it possible it has something to do with the tap water? - I mixed it with tap water. - No! Just be quiet. - Maybe the pills were expired? - Shut up! Stop it. Their in whats called stage for sleep. - What is that? - It's like practically a coma. But lucky for you they'll wake up from it. That means they're good. They're fine. - Yeah! They're not fine. - You are so lucky. I'm all fucked up man, I don't know. I mean, honestly if I wasn't your friend I would've called the police. You know... I'm a doctor... I'm not supposed to be like. So they don't need to go to the hospital, they're okay just here. So I don't have to tell... I don't have to tell their mother. They're going to be fine, they'll wake up... Well I don't know when your talking to her. It could be two days, it could be a week, - it could be up to four weeks. - Holy shit! It's not funny! We don't need to go to a hospital or anything like that. - So I don't need to freak out right? - They should be fine. Is this like dangerous, is there gonna be residual effects? Like I said, they're fine. I can't believe this. Alright, well thanks for coming in. Your welcome. I'm just glad everything's okay. - So we don't have to freak out. - We don't have to freak out. You just got to wait. I just, you know, I just have so much shit coming down at work, I'm not thinking clearly, man you know. I really appreciate this. I just can't... I don't know what's wrong with you. If you weren't my friend I would've called the police. - ...alright you said that twice now. - Thank you for coming by. You know that song. And what else did she do. Of rainbows and ﬂower... Rainbows and... Leslie Gould. So that was your apology to her? That was my apology, I mean I think that she... she accepted. Fuck! - Shit! He's back. - What? He's back hang on. Fuck! Shit. I'm more concerned with the guy screaming in this apartment. Do you see him? - Just pick up the bag. - OK, no, the bag has holes in it. - I have to get him in the jar. - He's more afraid of you. - Go in there. - Whoa. Put him in the thing. - OK. I'm gonna throw this out. - Okay go! Before we get into this. Why don't you just call the kids. Please, Stephen made it very clear... Listen to me. He said. A minimum of two days right, so I don't want to like... That's why I'm here. I don't want to rack my brain worrying about it hour by hour. I know, but then I... Just so that I could get it off my mind too, just give them a call and make sure that their not still wondering around the apartment, like awake. - Alright. - And lost. Hey guys! It's me! There's no doubt in my mind that your asleep right now. But on the off chance that you woke up prematurely, here I am. Pick up the phone. If you hear my voice, pick up the phone. If you can hear me, pick up the phone. Come on guys. Come on guys. Alright I'm gonna count to three. And I'm just going to assume that you are asleep. One one thousand, pick up the phone. Two one thousand. Alright three one thousand, alright I'm not far guys. I'll keep checking in. I love you. Bye. But you were buying spray paint and that was for work. Yeah. I can put it on the tab and buy, you know, an overload of an amount and I can kind of sneak in my own colors. - For? - I go bombing. What does that mean? Bombing. Like graffiti. You know, like that primitive... Really? Like, you write stuff or you draw pictures? - I write rambo. On Sundays. - Rambo. You write that? - I usually like to go on Sundays- - Are there less cops maybe? Yeah, well they have that T.N.T. Tuesday night task-force. Tuesdays and Thursdays there are more cops on the street. - Hey, what's up, man? - What's happening? - Lenny. - Hey. What's up, man? - You mind if I join you guys? - No. Look, I don't wanna interrupt I'm just totally listless. I just wanna kill time. You know, I don't wanna go home yet... He's gonna tell us a story. He's a graffiti artist. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to say that. For Christ's sake. - You can't even see it. - C'mon. It's fuckin' cold, man. Cut it out. For cryin' out loud. Let me have this. No oil here. I don't know what that means. It looks good, Lenny. Way to lay it on thick, man. Don't put my last name on there. Lenny! Run! Lenny! 50. Run Lenny! - Oh, fuck. - NYPD, let me see your hands! - Let me see your hands! - Whoa, whoa, listen! - Let me see your hands! - I didn't do anything. Up against the wall. Let me see your hands. - Hey! I'm not resisting. - Let me see your hands. - I didn't do anything! - Stop movin'. - First of all... I don't wanna hear your mouth! Stop movin'! - I'm not resisting. - What do you have on you? Listen to me. I was writing something nice. - What'd you have on you back there!? - Do I have anything on me? Alright. I'm not resisting. For the record, I'm not resisting! Let's go. Line up right over here by the window. Back against the wall. Back against the wall! I'm tryin' to figure out what needs to happen before we can get back out on the street. - Well, Dad, we need to- - Don't be a dick, alright? We'll probably see a judge in the next twenty-four hours, - I'm assuming. - It's gonna be a while. Since it's the weekend we're definitely gonna be in here a little longer. I don't want the fuckin' sandwich! Cut it out! Leni. It's me. This is a bonafide emergency. So, I don't know where you are, I don't know why you're not picking up your phone. That was my last quarter. I'm kinda freakin' out. I need you to please go up to thirty-fifth street and check on the kids as soon as you get this. I have to see a judge apparently and that might happen at nine in the morning, it might happen at eleven in the morning... goodbye. Anyone have another quarter? Why don't you call collect? - You want my sandwich? - No. I'm good, thanks. Hey buddies. Dad, can you turn down the music? Frey! Oh God! Sage! You're awake! Oh my God! Listen, listen, we overslept, we're late for school. We have five minutes. We overslept. It's my fault. It's my fault! - This isn't the right way. - Right way where? To school. Well guess what? That's 'cause we're not going to school. - Where are we going? - C'mon, fuckers! Jump up. Run! - It seems to easy... - Alright, go. I'll catch you. You know what'll happen if you fall over. I'll race you down, Sage. Ready, go. Hey, hey. Okay. C'mon guys. C'mon, slowpoke. - Daddy? - What? Get down. C'mon, dad! Frey, Frey, Frey come here. Great. It's great. It's fortifying. Stop, guys. C'mon. I want you to appreciate what you're seeing. Isn't there something? Give me one detail from each window and then we can move on. You each have to say one detail. Realistic clouds. Okay, good. Realistic clouds. That's one. You? - Red ﬂowers. - Okay, red ﬂowers. That's good. Okay, one detail out of each window and then you're aloud to move on. Beautiful background. Beautiful background. Okay, that's sorta generic, but it's passable. It means, you know, it's not the most colorful description. What's happening, guys? - Is that real? - Yep. You know I killed one just like this in the bathroom the other day. - Did it suck your blood? - Actually, it didn't suck my blood but I used one of your old sweatshirts to sop it up. - Was there a lot of blood? - Oh, yeah. - That would suck all of your blood out. - There native to New York. Yeah that would suck all of your blood out. Are those real? Yeah, they breed in the sewers. Nah, it's made out of wax I think. They magnify it so you can see all the details. That's incredible. - Heads under. - Daddy, you know that mosquito you said you killed that we saw in the museum? I was kidding. That was a joke. Remember today you were making all sorts of jokes. Remember at the museum you said I looked like the monkey. - No. - Well, I was joking too. Yeah, but- Mosquitoes do not exist at that size. They don't exist in this apartment at that size. Only in the world of jokes are there mosquitoes that big. - Alright, guys, dunk your heads. - But was it slimy? Under, under, under. C'mon, seriously guys dunk your heads please. - I did. - I know you did. Please. Take a page from your brother's book. - Mom's name is Paige. - That's right. That's correct. Alright, you don't leave me any choice. Dad, every time I close my eyes I see the mosquito and you said you'd turn on the lights, so can you please turn on the lights? It's just gonna make it harder to fall asleep. Can you please turn on the light, I don't care. - Yeah, can you turn on the light. - Alright, alright. I don't want the mosquito to come and suck my blood out. You realize, guys, that mosquitoes are drawn to light. So, if anything this is just gonna make it scarier. And harder for us to fall asleep. 'Night dad. 'Night dad, 'night Sage. Alright, goodnight guys. When are we gonna see you again? Soon, very soon. Five days? - Well, not five days. - I bet in a year. - Less than a year. - No. - Yes, I mean. - C'mon guys. Yes we'll see in you in less than a year. - Hey. - Sorry, I'm late. Hi, I love you guys. I missed you. Listen, I got movie tickets. We gotta go. - Alright, go to your mom. - Let me get a taxi. C'mon, go to your mother. I know you guys don't wanna go, c'mon! Run! I'm serious, you're late. Go. - Here's a taxi, you guys! - Seriously, no joke, it's time. - They don't wanna leave. - I got treats. - Listen, say good bye to your dad. - Bye, dad. - Just wave to your father. - Hey Frey, you know what? That's what. - Wave to your dad. - The bag! - The bag! - Hey! Hey! Sorry. Hey, hey. What do we have? Got some nice wood here. - Look, you don't see this everyday. - Dale, c'mon. This is good. I can do anything with this. - Help me take it to the car. - It's junk. No, it's good, I can do anything with it. It's junk. Check it out. It's cheap wood. You see that? - Relax, man. You're gonna ruin it. - Ruin it? It's a piece of shit! Relax, man! Leni. I am not angry. I am frustrated. And very confused. I would like to just hear from you. If you would like me to stop calling you I would like to know that. I keep saying, the kids are not here anymore. I have the free space, I have the mental space to be more considerate. I don't know. Please, just call me and say hello. Or call me to tell me to stop calling you. Fuck! Six-five. Hey! Hey! What the fuck are you doing, man!? Hey! Hey, quick, you hear that? Frey, Frey? Sage? Sage? Sage! What's shakin'? What's happening, kiddo? Very good. Listen, will you put your morn on? Will you put your morn on for me? Okay. Here she is. It's dad. Lenny? Well, you know, it's six o'clock, I'm making dinner. What's up? Do this part again. I've got Carmen coming tomorrow... No, no, but tomorrow is a half-day and I've got plans to take the kids to see my folks this weekend. Okay? So it's not gonna happen. It's a half day. Right. And I have paid Carmen in advance. She's coming to get the kids so it's not gonna work. I understand that you miss the kids, that's great, but frankly, you're lucky you even see the kids. You are. Because I hear the stories. You know, I could easily get full custody with these kids. The stories that I've heard with all your weirdo friends. These are little kids, it's completely inappropriate what you do with them. I know you're the father, but you know what? You're not a great father all the time. And you certainly were not that great when you had them for the last two weeks. It's not gonna happen, my food is getting burnt and over done here, I've got to go. Okay, I'll see you. No. Goodbye. Have you done anything? No. You haven't done anything. This is homework that's due tomorrow. You see? It's double sided, do it. Okay? Frey, we're gonna eat in five minutes, okay? So just hang in there. Frey! Frey! Frey! Carmen! Cómo estas? - Cómo está usted? - Cuanto tiempo! Mucho tiempo. How you doin' buddy? Surprise! - Hay una problemo. - Si, qué paso? Paige made a big mistake. Change of plans. I am taking the boys, I'm gonna give them a nice home-cooked meal today, I'm gonna return them. - I'm worried- - No, no, don't be worried. She gave me the money. It was just a mistake. Please. You know I'm responsible for them. How you doin' buddy? Where's your brother? - Be good with daddy. - Say goodbye to Carmen. Alright, guys. Check it out. Alright we're almost ready for the chicken, guys. Alright? I made a list. Where is it? We need some groceries. Sage, come over here. - You're in charge. - What are we having for dinner? - We're having Lenny surprise. - Oh god. Chicken Lennini! Listen to me. This is a grocery list. Read it back to me. Milk, cream, orange juice, apple juice, peppercorn, salt- I don't want you going to the Korean place on the corner, alright? - It's a rip-off. - Where else would we go? And you're gonna make a left, then you're gonna make a right- this is how we save money- then you're gonna make a right. You're gonna go to the big supermarket. Alright? This is fifty-five dollars. - I'll take it. - I got it. You're in charge of the money. You're in charge of picking out the items. Teamwork, guys. Alright, go. Twenty-ninth street and third avenue. Bye, dad. Frey, Frey! Look, fruit snacks. They're my favorite. - They have real fruit in them. - Toss 'em in, I guess. Rosemary, rosemary. Crushed rosemary? - Crushed or leaves? - Leaves. - Why leaves? - It looks nicer. - Hey! ' Hey, dad! Quick! Catch it! C'mon guys. - Come on in. Guys, come on in. - What's happening? Listen to me, okay? Listen to me, very carefully, alright? This is a surprise. We are moving, we have ten minutes to bring everything down to thirty-sixth street. - What do you mean we're moving!? - Just what I said.

I'm not kidding. Listen to me... Good afternoon, if you're standing, hold on please, while the cabin's in motion.
