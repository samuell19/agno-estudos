Give me alms in the name of God. Water for sale. 500 francs today, 1000 tomorrow. Abidjan is big. When I'm ready here, I won't come back. Kady, make something to eat for your little brother. Mama, Kady is teasing me. Kady, I'll see you later. And don't teas your brother. Aren't you the oldest? I didn't do anything. Are you starting that too? I haven't got my wages yet. You've got to manage with that. I'm at the highway this morning. I'll bring bananas and jam. A kilo of meat rose to 900 F. We also need chicken. Your sister is here on parental leave. We should pamper her. I know. How long will she stay? Did you ask her? You shouldn't ask a thing like that. Her daughter is only five months old. She can't walk yet. What about the chicken? - You pay it in advance for now. This time you will really get it back. Habiba! Why don't you speak to me? I didn't see you. I haven't forgotten. The economic climate, you know. I'll be coming soon. Economic climate? What's that? The new evil. Money has become scarce. The women of Abidjan think that the month will never end. Habiba owes me money for two pakkages for two months already. We are suffering. He picked that wallet. Get him. Let them do their job. Or else we'll have to leave here. Hey, beautiful lady. Come here. Take a look. Nice fabrics. Very nice. The green one is pretty too. It will look great on you. Have you got a fourth with it? I've got this too, absolutely colorfast. The last one. Very pretty. I've been looking for such for a long time. Will you pay? Wait, I'll get exchange. Can you give me change? Do you have change for this? - Only if you buy a lottery ticket. No, first you buy a ticket. Here you are. Here you are, your change. - Thank you. Goodbye. And people say there isn't any money left. The ones who got it, have tons of it. Imagine he's buying that all for his wife. His wife? I know her. She's a secretary at the TV. - She's his lover. - No, really? Ali, I did the same as you today. What? I bought a lottery ticket. A ticket? You always said you'd never play. That you can't get rich from the lottery. Did the advertisement on the radio persuade you? Not at all. I had to change some money. That's how it starts. If you have won ten grant, you'll change money for a new ticket. Sita, are you coming with me to buy new shoes? OK. What about my mango stall? You're not here to work, but to take care of your child. You'll get what you need to go back. Kady, you do the dishes. - I'm supposed to meet some friends. You always have time to get all dressed up. But you don't make yourself useful. Wait and see when you've got a family. Then I'll have a washing machine and a servant. You're living in a dreamworld. As long as you haven't married a minister, you'll do the dishes here. Wait. Please drop me at the market. Can't you do anything else? Like what? Stealing? Singing? Playing soccer? Never mind. Take it. Hurry up! You must be new here. You should go to the boss. And now the results of the biggest prizes. The prize of 1 million francs goes to ticket 2373267. And to ticket 2511948... ...goes the biggest prize of 3 million francs. I won. I'm rich! I've got it. I'm rich. I'm rich! I'm rich! I'm rich! Good evening! Good evening! Clear the table. We're going to eat. The same again? Why isn't corn cake baked here ever? Of the 1000 francs you give me? Did you discover a goldmine? We all have to cut down these days. Awa, my dream has come true. Our problems have come to an end. Our life will change completely. What are you saying? Did you win the lottery? Indeed! I've won 3,000,000 francs! Quiet, you! I'm going crazy. Wasn't it my ticket by any chance? What's up? Nothing, it was just the kids. I was startled. The children were yelling. You can go now. Goodnight. What's going on? You're waking up the baby. Your brother won the lottery. Our poverty is finished. Lottery? What's that? Tell me, Awa. Did you put the ticket back? - Yes. But I can't find it. Do you thing dad will buy a lot for us? Of course. We are rich now. Are you sure you gave him back the ticket? It better not be lost. I hope God spares us that misery. The fortune at our door, gone? Never! We'll find it. Leave it. We haven't looked there in three months. Didn't you leave it at your desk at work? At my desk? That's possible. You can't clean here until the ticket surfaces. Understood. It can't disappear like that. It must be at your desk. Do you realize how much luck we've got. Of course. Let's go to diner, it's getting cold. Do you think dad will buy a colour-TV? - Yes. And a car took take us along. And we'll get pocket money. Great. Then I can buy a lot of cassettes. You know what I'm going to buy? That's enough. Do you think you can pass your mathtest this way? A new car, that would be nice, don't you think? Of course. And what about a sewing machine? Don't you know I have learned how to sew? Good morning. What happened? Yesterday, the house was searched. This morning they left early. Didn't you hear? My brother won the lottery. The lottery? So now he's rich? But they can't find the ticket. They have to find it! I didn't say anything. Don't tell anyone. Can you write a letter for me? Sure. After that I have to stamp. What for? - To get my unemployment benefit. They give you money although you don't work? Why don't they give you work? You're smart. Go explain it to the government. Leave me alone! Go on. I'm sure it was him. This is that taxidriver. I don't know this woman. I don't know you. He threatened me wis a knife. - That's not true. Shut up. We found a knife on your carseat. There's a lot of rabble walking around. - That again. There's nothing but criminals nowadays. Quiet, lady. Tell me what you did Thursday the 25th. I wasn't on duty that day. - Are you sure? He's lying. - No. I wasn't on duty. My car was in repair. Quiet! Explain it to the judge. By the way, what are you looking for? I lost 3 million. What? 3 million? Never mind. I'm looking for a file. Greetings to my mother and to himself. Greetings to the big and the little Tenin. Greetings to Fatou. Greetings to Korotoumou and his little sister. Write that I arrived well. And the fever of the child went down. And write that my brother won a lot of money in the lottery. Are you crazy? What if your father comes here? I want to be there when my brother will receive the money. Then he can buy his tractor and take it back. I wouldn't write that. If your brother knows, he'll be pissed off. Write father he can't tell that he knows it from us. Anyway, I'll tell. My brother shouldn't miss this fortune. So write it! Write it! Good evening, dad. - Good evening. Good evening. We're going to the delegate. I called him. He's expecting us. Why? I told him about the ticket. He wants to help us. He hasn't seen you for a while. - Why not? I'm not his dog. Writing letters, translating... Because he can't read. I should join the parliament myself. That's your problem. He brought you to the city, right? Awa, hurry up! - I'm just putting on another dress. Otherwise he'll notice how poor we are. Kady, have dinner with your brothers. I don't know what time we'll be back. Sita, je must eat alone. Maybe we'll get good chickensauce. All Africans are welcome with me. And your family for sure. Tel me, Issa! What happened? You were suddenly gone, without reason. We'll talk about it later. Awa, it's you! - Mrs. delegate, good evening. - How are you? You should have told me, Waritigui! I would have made dinner. I'm glad you're here. Come, Awa. We'll leave them alone with their business. Ali, do you see that? The ladies withdraw to gossip and to pick on us. Ali, have you heard the latest news of the country? A new guy arrived and everybody hates him. He interferes with everything. He wants to put the finance in order and shut down our activities. Dear God, I'll take a walk to the village at the end of the month. Excuse me, someone's at the door. - How much is this? - 20,000 F. Is that all? - 20,000 F. - But why? - My car broke down. When will you finally come with 30,000 F? Morning, afternoon, evening, you're cat is always broken. Is it for 5,000 I purchased my car? If you don't want to work, don't touch my car. I'm fed up with it. There are enough drivers. All the time, the car is broken. You don't deserve a penny! So I bought that car for nothing. - I was at the garage. - I don't care! Ali... I forgot to ask you... What did you say on the telephone? My wife, Awa, bought a lottery ticket. And that bill won the highest price. But since that day, the both of us can't find it anymore. The winning ticket? How much did you win? We won 3 million francs. Oh my God! But without the ticket, we can't collect the money. How can you lose the winning ticket? In the regulations it says... ...if you don't present the ticket within a month, you lose. I came to ask you, do you know someone at the lottery who can change the date? I would have more time to look for the ticket and find it. I know someone, minister Aka, a friend of mine. His cousin is the director of the lottery. I can talk to him. I will talk to him about it. But you know the rules of the game in this country nowadays. No minister, no director, no one does anything for nothing. If you need someone you have to give. If we see the Minister we will offer him something. In fact, young man, what's your idea about politics? You don't care for it, right? But everything depends on it now. I'll nominate myself and then I'm counting on you. You could be part of the council at my side. You should take an interest in politics. Put everything aside. If you don't do politics today, you've got nothing. Issa, come see me at the office. I'll recommend you at a new factory. But first, I've have something to say to you: Living is easy, but surviving... that's the hard part. Always and everywhere you take the lead. You see things others don't see and you tell it. Then you'll be the first to get fired. You should be working quietly... ...and feed your family. You shouldn't want to be the first all the time. It's getting late, we must go. - So soon already? Alright. Call me in three days. Even if you don't call, I'll step by. I'll come to tell you how things worked out. I'm coming! - What's up, Waritigui? - Ali and his wife are leaving. So soon? We were having such a nice chat. I guess you were talking about men and jealousy again. And why not? Awa, I'll see you at the market. Here is the dried shrimp sauce. Chicken sauce from the deputy. They didn't offer us anything. - What did you talk about... ...you and Mrs. deputy, like two old friends? About a lot of things. She told me about her life. About her kids, who study in France... ...and that her friends are wives of ministers and deputys. She wants to come to the market again. I sold her something, but made trouble about the payment. That's how those people are. When I asked them for help to open up a shop... I went there so often, for months, without result. All my shoes were worn. So they should help us. He will help us if it helps his reputation. It's about a lot of money. Let's go to bed, or we'll wake up the others. You took your time. Did you get something from him? He promised to help us. - God should help us. Come back later. I didn't earn anything so far. I've got tickets. - Excuse me. It's getting worse. It's already in the newspaper. What shall we do? I thought you had found the ticket. Not at all. They say we should get the money tomorrow. We must do something. I know a soothsayer. You, Awa? - I never go there... ...but it's said he is good. Let's go there. Where is he? - In Medinacoura. Alright, let's go. Would you take care of my stall? Let's go. I don't see anything serious. I see prosperity and happiness. You must make a sacrifice to your ancestors. Great happiness... Very great happiness... And luck... That's what I see, but you must make a sacrifice. And I see a stranger. You will receive a stranger. I see... a big fortune. But you must make a sacrifice near your birth village. Don't forget your ancestors. Do you understand? Excuse me, holy man. We lost something valuable. My wife and I both don't know where it is. That's why we're here. I can only tell what I see. I can't lie. I don't see lost things. If you lost something, it must be somewhere in your house. I can only say what I see. I'm furious about this soothsayer, with his 'stranger'. A stranger will arrive! Is this the moment? A soothsayer is only good for women who want to win the favors of their husbands. He saw that for 200 F, that's what I gave him. You would give him 500 F. You don't know a thing about money. Money's no good. It ruins the world. Money's no good at all. A lot of man's mistakes are caused by money. Grandfather is here. - What do you say? Thank you, Baba! It didn't rain much this year, but I brought some bananas and yams. to make porridge. You didn't inform us. Should I? Your mother couldn't come, because she's tired. Who told you? - What do you mean? The whole village knows it. But we lost the ticket. What do you say? Ticket? Ticket! We heard you were rich and now you talk about a ticket? Ali, this is the last straw. Allah is big and Mohammed is his prophet. We won, but he lost the ticket. We'll find it. Take a bath, so you can relax after your trip. I couldn't buy sugar, the price went up again. Dear God! And you're laughing? An price increase makes you laugh? I'll give you some more money. You'll learn someday, that everything gets more expensive. You will understand what it means. Go now! Kady, you're grandfather is with you. What's going on? Nothing Nothing? Your father won the lottery, right? The whole neighborhood knows it. I always get yelled at because of your price rise. Kady, don't say that! You are a big family. And you won money. It's because of the cocoa, we can't help it. Did you see what you did? You wait...if I get the blame... What have I done? You know. Haven't you seen grandfather? I don't care. This is the worst. The old man is only here to get his tractor. Can I clean up the house? Clean up? I don't even want you to sweep. What if you made a mistake? What do you think I am? Crazy? Or blind? I don't want to hear the word 'mistake' again. Sorry, I have to search the childrens room too. This is the only place I haven't tried yet. Look in your bags, maybe it's there. And hurry up, you've got to go to school. Hurry up. Awa, can I borrow some salt? I'm out of it. Here is your salt. Put it in my hands. That's enough. Thanks. I really had nothing left. Thanks! Issa, you must go to Mr. Credit... I mean Mr. Dicre. Ask if I left something in his car and ask if he's coming by. I'll be going that way anyway after dinner. Now, I tell you. What kind of family is this? Issa, what brings you here? All well? - Fine. And your sister in law? - Fine as well. Issa is here. How are you, Issa? - Very well. Will you have dinner? We're just starting. - I already had dinner. My brother asks if you come and visit him this afternoon and if he left anything in your car. - He already looked there. He's not himself. He sends you here for such a thing? It's strange. - Maybe he is seeing a woman. You are so suspicious. I can assure you: We are going to make a deal at the credit bank. Another loan? With all the trouble we've got already to pay our debts? I'm not with you on this. - Stop whining. Issa, tell him it's alright. See you later. Have a nice day. You should be doing something... ...instead of all whining all the time. How much do earn? The wages didn't rise for the last ten years and the prices keep rising. The whole village is counting on me. That's why I never ask you anything. I've got so much pity for you that I'd almost give you my wages. - I wish you did! Awa, it was delicious. I'm glad you liked it. - Ali? - Yes. When you're done, I'd like to talk to you. I'm already done. Awa! Take him to bed. That boy sleeps all the time. Once he's asleep, he's asleep well. But he's growing very quick. When you're done, you've got to do your homework. They're allowed to listen. The children can learn from it. Awa, get Sita here too. You have welcomed me very well. I won't forget the taste of your sauce very soon. But I want to go back to the village. You want to go so soon? You just arrived! I know that if I stayed one month, two months, it doesn't bother you. But the field is waiting for me. I've got work to do. My eyes looked around here and they saw a lot. Ali... take care of yourself. Since you're worrying about that paper, you're not yourself anymore. I taught you honor and dignity. That money is a fraud. But that doesn't matter. A man should earn money with working hard. Things are passed on from oldest to oldest. And you, son of a poor man... ...continue to work hard... ...to earn what you need to feed your family. I'll tell you a story about a man. He was so blinded by money, that he lost his friends and family. I found a diamond! I found a diamond! Shall I come with you, my friend? My friend, you can't come with me. Our friendship ends today. Poverty is not a virtue, wealth isn't either. But friendship between a poor and a rich is not easy. In all my gestures you would see the conceit of a rich man. It is God who gives wealth. You can have my old cloths and food leftovers. I have to go now. Good evening. - How are you? I'm sorry, but this is not a diamond. It looks like it, but it isn't a diamond. No diamond? - No. Now imagine the meeting of this man and his friend. Wouldn't he be terribly ashamed? This is what I wanted to tell you. Sita, don't stay here too long. Your husband is waiting for you. You already want to leave so soon and now you're telling others to leave too. I'm just saying she shouldn't stay too long. Her husband is waiting. Ali, you should come to the village to make a sacrifice. These things are important in life. You forget these things over here. You're right. We can go a few days to make a sacrifice. That would bring me great pleasure. Father is right. Now and then you should make a sacrifice. I'll come with him for a few days to make a sacrifice. Maybe then we'll find the ticket. - That could be so. May we have a newspaper? They still don't know who won the lottery. They ask him to present himself. It seems like you don't need the money. If I were you... ...I would go for those millions. - You're right. I'll go now to do something. - I can't stay here alone. I'll be right back. Can I speak to the deputy? It's his nephew. No, lady, it's very urgent. What? He's not there? What do you say? Arrested? Two days ago? Don't exagerate. You could have gone hiding for the rain. Only God can help us. What's the matter with him? I don't know. I'm worried. Ali, what are you doing? Have you gone crazy? I'm glad to meet you, I already went to your place. Would you like something to drink? That won't solve the problem. I know, but I'm not drunk. This time I've got a fair proposition for you. At a printing house. 60,000 francs. - Great. For how long? I'd rather have 30,000 a few years than 100,000 in 3 months. I've got news. My brother won 3 million in the lottery. 3 million? Give us all a round to drink. Take it easy. He lost his ticket. You must search for it quick. I'll help you. I'll meet you in the village. I'll pick some herbs to make the sauce. My eye is shaking as if a guest will come. I'll take precautions. With these cassava leaves I'll make the best sauce ever. Add dried fish and peanut butter and it will make a good sauce. It's good my cousin Ali came. We haven't seen Ali for so long. Ali! Do you think of us since you've had so much luck? Uncle didn't tell us supposing we wouldn't hear the news. But he can't hide such big news. Above all, I wanted to go to Abidjan to learn what the situation is. before telling you anything. But I didn't hear you about that paper here. I won, but I can't find the ticket. It's not completely lost. I will find him. Here, two stories go around. One says you've won, the other says you didn't. But anyway, about one of my sons. I want him to go to school with you so he can get me out of this misery. Forget about it. I just came from Abidjan and I only saw misery there. You only see the problems in Abidjan. But we see everything that is going on. We have never seen it anywhere. On the anniversary of our independence, the blind and the lame received money. And even the ones who didn't work, received money. We heard it on the radio. Is life hard over there? We'll tell you something else. Drop the subject. Ali is here for a sacrifice. Tomorrow we don't go to the fields, before we've done the ceremony. Sekou, We'll do it at your father's house 'cause he is the oldest of the family. Let's toast to a peaceful night! Yacouba, give me some water for my hands. I really suffer. I really can't take it anymore. Since my husband died, there's nonody to help me to take care of my children. Little brother, I wrote to you several times, but you never answer. I thought you had problems too. But the luck God gave you, belongs to us too. Please give me some money. I want to open up a little shop. You are my only hope, Ali. I was going to pay for the trip to go to you. Fanta, my daughter, you have told your problems to your brother. He can't ignore it. He will help you. Thanks for your support, mother. Ali, you must be tired from the journey. I'll leave you to rest. Sleep well. - Goodnight. Sleep well, sister. I wish you well. Ali... What's the story about all that money? The whole village is talking about it. It's true, mama. I won. I don't understand, but I can't find the ticket anymore. It's making me crazy. But I'll keep searching until I find it. When you found it, think about the tractor for your father. That would be a good idea. Everyone critizes you and say you do nothing for us, that your brothers do everything and you do nothing. When I heard this news, I was so happy. But your father wasn't. You know what we can do with all that money? I know very well, my son. I see that money can bring us happiness. But keep working hard, my son, to earn and save money. That's the best thing to do. Are you still talking about that money? Didn't I get through to you, when I spoke to you in Abidjan. I don't want to talk about that money anymore. Don't you see, your son will get everyone against him. We already want to send children to school there. Listen to your father. You must respect his wisdom. Listen son! Have you gone crazy? Well, you see... Enough of this. What are you doing? Before the 31st! After that date the money goes to charity. Bissimi! Great power and spirit. If the stars are right for this man... ...rise. If what he's looking for, will be found... ...rise! My brother. You don't know me, but the one who sent you here, knows me. And he trusts me. I can tell you this: the important thing you have lost, will be found. But it will take some time. - I need it now. I can help you... ...but in life nothing is free. I ask you two things: - 50,000 F and a sheep. - Oh my God! I won't sleep for three nights, without going to the toilet. 50,000 F? Where do I find that in these hard times? My brother... ...I can only say this: You know this place now. I won't leave. Good, I'm on my way. See you later. You won't see him again. - Yes I will. He'll be back. But if he doesn't find anything? - He'll be here for sure. At ease, sergeant. Ali, my little brother, you cause me sorrow. You are my brother and I wrote you several times. But you never respond. The chance God has given you, belongs to us all. I beg you for some money to start up a shop. You're my only hope, Ali. A young man and some crooks have been arrested. Issa. Where was he arrested? In a night bar. - A night bar? Did he have a lot of money with him? He's been away from home for almost four days. Now I understand. I'm getting it now. He stole the ticket, got the money and went away. I'll be right back. I'm from the fourth district. You called me. About the man who was arrested. - Right, I'll get him. He says he is your nephew. His name is... - Issa. Did he have a lot of money with him? Did he have a companion? - Are we talking about the same guy? This guy was arrested for smuggling drugs, but he didn't have money. But do you know him? If you can guarantee for him, we can release him. Let him go. Don't cry, little lady. Isn't this better? Girls like baths so much. I am too busy, otherwise I'd do it more often. Here you are, get her dressed. You act like there is good news. Good news? You are not informed well. They put the date in the newspaper. We only got three days left. - Issa showed me. Issa? What business is it of him? Why is he talking about it? Why does he stick his nose in someone else's business? Issa has been living here for too long. I went to someone who wants to help us. But you know, nothing is free nowadays. He wants 50,000 F. - 50,000? Now you're throwing away that little money we've earned too? What? Awa, what are you saying? Are you felling alright? Are you crazy? Though you may earn a little money too you can't say anything you want. I don't accept this. I am the boss in this house, not you! This was once and never again. Understand? Anything else? I'm sorry if I offended you. I didn't mean to. But how do we get that money? And if... Let's forget it. Forget it? Are you crazy? Why should I? I'm really fed up with it. I can't let that money go just like that. I can't accept that. Go ahead, you can forget it. I won't let go of it until I die. You've changed so much. We had nothing before. But we managed, didn't we? Sure, we managed. But now, it's different. We are on the verge of being rich. Millionaire. Think about it, millionaire! The rich are sitting on their money. You know why? Because they're afraid to become poor again. Because they know the misery of poverty. You never know if you're going to eat tomorrow. That's their fear. And the old man is waiting for his tractor. How can I buy that without money? Do you understand what that money means? We spent too much time behind other people. I don't want to be poor anymore. We can't manage on my salary or on the little money you earn. If we make it or not depends on that money. I'm worried. You're losing your head. Losing what? Tu es folle? Losing my head? Why are you saying that? It's my money. If you don't want it, that's fine with me. But stop insulting me. What's up? Are you fighting? You can hear it outside. No, it's nothing. Water for sale. Today 500 francs, tomorrow 1000. Abidjan is big. When I'm gone, I won't come back. What kind of water is that? Just buy it and you'll see the effect. Today 500 francs, tomorrow 1000. Here you are. Who's been messing with my desk? - I don't know. But the commissioner was here. He wants you to go to him. How was he this morning? I don't know. I didn't watch him that closely. You come in too late, you leave early and you're not on your post. If the service doesn't give a good example, what would people say? Be careful, Ali. I hear and see everything. You want to be a millionaire. I know that. Everyone knows that. You go ahead, but not during working hours. The job comes first. This time I let it pass. But next time I want an explanation from you. Hello. Hi Awa, hello. How is it at home? Sit down. Please sit down. Dear woman, please sit down. - Awa, hello. - Hello. Who's that lovely lady? - Ali's sister. Has she been here long? - Yes. - Welcome. - Thank you. Awa, how are things at the market? - Not bad. By the grace of God, we're fine. I haven't seen you for a while, that's why I came by. Didn't she give you the money? - Who? What? Didn't she give it to you? I gave her that money for you at the market. I don't believe it. Let's ask her to clarify this now. Get up and let's go. Come on. Awa, be patient. These are hard times. The children are going to school again. And my marriage is not so great anymore either. Sorry, I'll see you at the end of the month. Don't embarrass me in front of his other wives. Why don't you say something? - I've got nothing to do with it. Take this and please forgive me. You see, Sita. That's how it goes with those ladies. Terrible! How can I collect 50,000 F for Ali? Let's go. I have collected some of my debts today. Tomorrow I might get that 50,000 F. Is it really worth it? You were actually right. It seems like we only get misery from it. I'm glad to hear you say so. It's good to have money, but we should think of our bond, that we need to raise our children. By the grace of God, we'll get through this. Here you are. Dad, you must sign this. Hey, little thief. Do you have my mathbook? I searched everywhere. Do you have my English book too? - Leave him alone. The things you've got in your bag! Look at this. What's this? And this? Awa, I found our ticket. You found the ticket? Thank God. You'll wake up the baby! - We found the ticket! Ali, what's going on? - Nothing. What do you mean 'nothing'? You're shouting and then tell me nothing? Why do you act like this? - It's nothing, really. Welcome, sister. Come in, this is the house of your uncle. Come in. Was that all? - Yes. This is for you. Hello, mister. What can I do for you? I came to bring the winning ticket of last month. Please sit down. Did you call in advance? - No, why?

We will buy a tractor for the old man. That's useful for all of us. We'll see about the rest later. That's a good idea. Where is the ticket? Take it easy. It's at the lottery office. We'll get the money in two days? - Two days? Why did you give them the ticket? Did you give it to someone you trust? I really don't know anymore, Awa.
