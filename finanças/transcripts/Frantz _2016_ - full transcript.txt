Here lies Frantz Hoffmeister Under these flowers, nothing. Nothing? He was buried in France, anonymously among other soldiers. We know the date of his death. Sometimes, I think it is not dead, it will return. I'm sure he hears us. The long sobs Autumn violins Hurt my heart from a monotonous languor Completely flushed and pale When the hour strikes, I remember Past days And I cry And I go With the bad wind Which brings me here, there Like dead leaf Has a beautiful accent. I often spoke in French. It was our secret language. Frantz so loved France. But he never told me about you. What was between you? A woman? No... So what? A... A friendship, that's all. I had forgotten this. Wind noise among the leaves... It is for that noise that I love spring. Are you often here? Yes. It was here that Frantz asked for my hand... before leaving for the war. And how did you meet? You never told him? No. It was in a bookstore while we were students. He was looking for a book of French poems. And I, a book of German poems. He asked me what my favorite poet. I said, "Ruckert". He replied, "Verlaine". He could have told me. She was jealous of his studies in France. I would have liked him, but... I'd rather be alone, far from home and his family. He said he would return there on honeymoon. I would discover Paris, the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, tower Great Boulevards... I'm hot! You do not want to go swimming? We do not have swimwear. It matters little. It matters little. Come on. Friend. Ah! It feels good! You should take a bath. It's just... I can not swim. Oh no? It is easy. I'll show you. Those are war wounds? Yes. He has suffered a lot. My only injury is Frantz. He looks like him. Do not you believe it? Not physically, but by their character. Shy and tormented. I'm glad you're here. Do you have brothers and sisters? No. I would have loved to have a brother. And his parents? My father died when I was a child. My mother took over the farm after his death, but with the war, it was complicated. What his father did? Business. Above all he was a musician. He conveyed his passion. I was in the conservatory and then I became a violinist in... the Orchestre de Paris. Now, after the war, I can not anymore. You do not want to play anymore? No longer I understand the notes. Often, Frantz played the violin for us. It was not a great musician, but he played with all their heart. Your room. It is just as he left it. Their books, his folded clothes in the closet. Frantz must have been happy here. Yes. But everything is broken. I forced myself to enlist. I sent into battle. It was his duty. Serve our country. Me too I was told. Is As the heart of my son. I GET IT the French. No. You can say, an old German gave it to me. I can not. It is the last photo of Frantz. The next day, he left for the front. Frantz hated war. Daily said that the French were his brothers. Detente ago. Read it aloud. "Dear Parents, I would love to escape, be close to you, away from this chaos. This morning, we were in front of a soldier killed and as if we had been opened eyes, We discovered a sea of ​​corpses. ¿French, Germans, how do I know? In school, children learn French German and Germans learn French. And when they grow up, they kill." I have to go. Thanks for everything. Before you leave, a favor, I beg you. Anna. Play something for us. Do not be afraid to make us happy. It's okay? Yes. It must have taken cold in the lake. ¿Frantz was a pacifist? I did not know, I did not know it? I regret that shocked.

"The noise is tremendous. "You can not imagine. "The battle be terrible. "Not all sleep. Maybe I can get out. "I pocketed, in my heart, "The rose you sent me ..." How do you know this letter? It was on September 15. On September 15, 1918. My regiment camped beside Dormans, in Marne. That day, we had raised us like other days. We cross the countryside, making recognition calm. Suddenly, in a field, the assault occurred. Some of us were made immediately. So I ran. I ran to a trench to seek refuge. Take refuge! ¡Help! Suddenly, I found myself facing a man. He, a German soldier. I, a French soldier. His gaze was so huge, so hopeless. I never know if I expressed the sadness of death or pity to see me kill him. So I fired. I shot first and he fell. It was I who killed Frantz, Anna. Not you. If at least he had shot, if I had hurt, but... His gun was not even loaded. It was not defended. Then he dropped a projectile and I was thrown to his side. Our two bodies, against each other. He... dead. And I live. Among his clothes, he had a letter. I read it. Since then he is... engraved in me. That letter... It was for you, Anna. Why did you come here? To apologize. To break free. To know the man he had killed. Since my arrival I wanted to tell the truth, but I saw in his grave. You believed in our friendship. And I did not dare disappoint. Thanks to this lie, I found out who was Frantz. Your family, your home... his girlfriend. Every day, she loved him a little more. Every day, my suffering was bigger. So, the Louvre, Manet's paintings, violin lessons... Do we have you lied? Yes. Because I'm a coward. And maybe because we did well, everyone. Anna, wait. My train leaves tomorrow at noon. I will tell all before. See you tomorrow. Good Morning. Good morning, Mr. Rivoire. The check, please. Immediately. He went home to meet the Hoffmeister. It's useless. I told them everything. And how did they react? As parents. You do not want to see me anymore? So is. I understand them. Bye. 6. wagon good trip. Do you think I can write? I don't believe. Anna... I need to write. Then, write to me directly to my name. I'll read them your letter. You're right. Thanks for everything, Anna. Bye. Anna. Have you sent a kiss from us? Yes. I hope your mother is not too sick. Have you said that we would love to return to play the violin? Yes, I said. And when did you return? That depends on his mother and his work. Surely soon. In two or three months. Perfect. To the table. He could have come to say goodbye to us. He apologized. All is forgiven youth. My dear Anna. I write this letter in French, so that my parents can not read it. I hope you get it. I write in the cold and mud. At any time, the assault may occur. The noise is tremendous. You can not imagine. The battle be terrible. Not all sleep. Maybe I can get out. I keep in a pocket, in my heart, the rose you sent me in your last letter. Promise me, dear Anna, if I happen a disgrace, you retain your joy of living and being happy. Why did you do it? There's enough dead in this war. Do you live in the house of Dr. Hoffmeister? Do not say anything. Still a little fever. You must eat. It is hot. I'm not hungry. You've always had a good appetite. The bookseller has received the book you were in charge. Thank you, Magda. Some fresh air. Anna. When Frantz died, you you held us and helped us survive. Now it's our turn. But you have to get up, you must leave, you must live. I have something for you. What? - I'll be back. - Yes. Sorry. - What happens? - A letter from Paris. At last. "Dear Anna, I write, as promised, a few weeks after my departure. My return to France was difficult. But I try to survive. Enclosed is my letter to parents of Frantz, which, I know, you can not delete my crime, but it will help you understand my presence among you. I know that forgiveness is impossible. I beg you, answer me. I hope your letter, Anna." "Since my return, I took care of my mother. She is better. I told my wonderful stay close to you, Frantz dear family. In Paris, life resumes. Each one tries to forget the suffering of war. I'm happy to be back playing with the Orchestre de Paris. Music soothes me... Music soothes me and it makes me happier. We're a few months on tour. As soon as I can, I will go to see them. I promise to Dr. Hoffmeister back to fiddling Frantz. Dear friends, I hope you are well. I miss, like the pure air of Quedlinburg. See you soon, Adrien." Do we have read everything? Yes. We received your letter well. Y... You know my lies and all my torments. God understands you, my child. He condemns lying, but your silence about the death of your boyfriend has a pure intention, that excuse your lack. Should not I say anything? What would bring the truth? More pain, more tears. What do you feel you by the young French? I do not know anymore. He killed the man I loved. This French soldier He came to Germany to apologize. Forgive him. As Jesus forgave his executioners. I give you absolution, my child. In the Name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Amen. Good morning, Anna. Good morning, Mr. Kreutz. You're good? Yes thanks.
