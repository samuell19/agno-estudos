His death seemed unnatural, but the doctor announced he died from food poisoning. That night Kihei Komuro, the taster, killed himself. He left no notes, but it was obvious he assumed responsibility. Nobody doubted it. The death sparked a serious problem for the government. They had not decided who would succeed the late Shogun. Iemitsu, Hidetada's eldest son, was to be heir. But unfortunately he was ugly and stammered. Hidetada disliked him. On the contrary, Tadanaga, the second son, was bright and handsome. He was an object of admiration. Hidetada's wife Oeyo also wanted him to be the next Shogun. She influenced the relatives and the ministers... lord of Owari, Doi, the Chief Chamberlain, Sakai, the Councilor... important men of the government. They eagerly backed Tadanaga. Meanwhile, Matsudaira Izu, a young chamberlain, and Lady Kasuga, leader of the harem, backed Iemitsu. Furthermore, the nobles hoped for the ruin of the government, including the scheming Saneeda Sanjo and Ayamaro Karasumaru. The temporary peace after the long civil war in Osaka was quickly disappearing. The funeral heralded turbulence in the near future. Zojo Temple, Shogun's Tomb Okay, let's go! What are you doing at this hour of the night? Who are you? Go! She's Yagyu's daughter. The others must be... - Father! - Come in. - We're back. - You got it? Yes, here. What?! Yagyu stole it?! Yes. Forgive me, my lord. Fool. Yagyu is a mere fencing coach. What's his game? Maybe he joined the group who sides with Iemitsu. - Hanzo. - Yes, sir. Watch the Yagyu family. He was poisoned. I thought so. They killed him. Who's "they"? Father! Is Jubei still back home? He wrote to me he was going to see a swordsman in Ise. He must be in Ise now. Send for him immediately. Yes, sir. Prince Iemitsu is coming. You want a secret meeting? Did you know this? Thieves broke into Zojo Temple last night. - What? - What did they steal? Late Shogun Hidetada's stomach. They probably wanted evidence of poisoning. Poisoning? Yagyu! Do you know what you're saying? For 10 years I've taught fencing to Prince Iemitsu. I love him more than anybody else. I think the people who poisoned Shogun Hidetada must have done it because of their love for the prince. They did it as a last resort. Wait. Now tell me exactly... what happened to the thieves? Did they succeed? Don't worry, I have what they stole. But I don't understand why criminals who poisoned him didn't prepare for the consequences. What do you mean? Even a fencing instructor like me isn't convinced. The death of Shogun Hidetada was so sudden. Chief Chamberlain Doi, who backs Prince Tadanaga, should suspect he was poisoned and want to know the truth. He was thoughtless. He wasn't prepared and was surprised by the news. His negligence concerns me. This is a critical time. They're jeopardizing the safety of Prince Iemitsu. Their negligence is unforgivable. Chamberlain, what do you think? Yagyu, you're right. I have no words to answer. To tell the truth, we did it. - Izu! - Quiet! The prince is coming. You want to talk with me? Is it about my late father? Please listen to me calmly, Prince. Your father didn't die of a disease. He was poisoned. What? Kihei, the taster who killed himself the other day... he put arsenic in your father's food for three days. W-why did he do it? Because he wanted to work for you... to die for you. He did what he was told to. W-who told him to do it? I did. What did you say? I told him to shorten Shogun Hidetada's life. Wait! If you really did, I'll kill you. I'll kill you! But you didn't. Who are you protecting? I'm not protecting anyone. Fool! Are you making fun of me?! Tell me! Who killed my father? As I said, I did. You bastard! No. T-tell me the truth, Yagyu! Please wait! Please wait, Prince. To tell the truth... to tell the truth, it was planned by the two of us. What? If they hadn't planned it, Prince, your father would have been killed... by me. You bastards. He decided not to choose you as heir. My f-father did not choose me as heir? Your mother agreed. They wanted Prince Tadanaga to be heir. We've served you since you were a child. We felt sorry for you. That isn't all. We wanted justice. You're the eldest son and should be heir. We must respect that. I have no regrets. After you become the Third Shogun, I'll commit hara-kiri. So what? That's no excuse! I've been unlucky. I-I'm ugly and I stammer. My parents hated me, my retainers despise me. Only a few people like you have supported me. To reciprocate, I'd hoped I'd be the next Shogun. But not anymore! How can I, now that I know you killed him?! You should be Shogun, Prince, no matter what. Yagyu! You were born to be Shogun. It's your destiny. D-destiny? If you still refuse to assume the post, kill the three of us here and now. What is a Shogun? The leader of all samurai. No, the leader of the people of Japan. Just me? Only one man was born to take office of Shogun, one out of millions of people. And that's you, my dear prince. Kill your parents if they stand in your way. Get rid of the Buddha if he interferes. You need determination more than justice. If you're unable to do it, I have nothing more to say. I beg you... to execute us immediately. Yagyu... Yes, sir. Izu... - Kasuga... - Yes, sir. I understand. Starting today... I'm ready to go to hell with you. Yamato Province Kurodani, Yagyu Lands All the members of our family are here. Hirakuchi's eldest son Hayate and Fuchikari's sister Mon are here to announce their independence. Men hunt and fish. Women pick vegetables. Let us unify our hearts. Let us have our homeland again. Let us have our homeland again! Hayate, Mon, the ceremony is over. You're now independent Negoro fighters. We lost our homeland 20 years ago. But someday we'll put it back in the hands of the Negoro family. Yes. Those weapons prove you're Negoro. Keep them. Yes. Next, I have something to tell you. Yagyu sent us a secret letter. He asks for our help because trouble is coming. This is our chance. I want to help him. What do you say? Agreed! Let's go. Let's show our power! - Agreed! - Agreed! Agreed! It won't be an easy fight. If I die, Hirakuchi takes command. If he dies, then it's Fuchikari! If all the men die, the women must fight. If our bones turn to ash, we'll still get back our homeland of Negoro. Intruders! There's more of them! Hayate! Mon! Get them! Look out! Who are you? You both have gotten stronger. - Jubei! - Yeah. I see you've been initiated. No wonder you're stronger. Oh, Jubei! Sagenta, I'm back. My sister wrote to me. You got my father's letter? You'll help us? Who do you think they are? I'm not sure. Ninja of Koga School. That's right. They were sent by Hanzo Watanabe, Doi's retainer. Doi? The Chamberlain? Sagenta, you're getting involved in a serious struggle. No regrets? No regrets! It's our last chance. Then I won't say anything. Let's fight together. Yes, let's. Mon, I missed your vegetable porridge. What? My father was poisoned?! Is it true? I firmly believe so. I can't believe it. What do you think, Mother? It's possible. Your father wanted you to be Shogun, but some disagreed so they killed him. Who? You know. Matsudaira Izu and Lady Kasuga... Iemitsu's aides. Right, Doi? Yes. I don't think they would dare kill him. Tadanaga, it's kind of you to protect your brother, but this is about what happened to your father. He doesn't deserve kindness. Mother, I didn't want to push my brother aside to become the next Shogun. Frankly, your expectations embarrassed me. Tadanaga... But that's a different matter. If he killed my father, he must pay for it. Prince, I'd stake my life on it. Please tell me what you plan to do about it. Understood. I'll see my brother. Prince Iemitsu is here. What would you like to discuss? This is an important conversation. Will you send him away? You mean Yagyu? Yes. He stays. He's my fencing instructor. He's one of my closest friends. Don't tell me what to do. What do you want to talk about? I'm listening. Then I'll start. Will you have our father's body examined? What for? Some doubt the cause of his death. Doi, is this your idea? Yes, Prince. Why? You ask me why? Don't you know? No, so I'm asking! They say your father was poisoned. Izu and Kasuga must know. Why didn't you tell him? Don't blame me. I heard the rumor too, but it's groundless. I refused to listen. So did I. Such rumors must not reach his ears. Is it really groundless? You can see if you examine your father's body. Iemitsu, I want to know the truth so my husband can rest in peace. I'm asking you, please have his body examined. No! Why not? We shouldn't disturb my father's peace for a rumor. As heir, I refuse to have his body examined. But brother, if the rumor is true he must be very angry. We're his sons... That's why. We're his sons... we shouldn't disturb him. But brother, such rumors can hurt your reputation. If you show us the truth, you can reign over us. What, you mean I can't reign as I am? I didn't mean that, I just said... Shut up! It's no use talking with you. Why run away, brother? How should I behave? You refuse to find the truth, so you must be guilty too. Only fools think like that. Fools? You call us fools?! So what? I don't want to see you anymore. Go back to S-Suruga! Outrageous! Your father was right... he has no ability to rule the nation. Was he involved in the murder of my father? He said Izu, Kasuga and Yagyu are his closest friends. Mother, come with me to Suruga. I have a big estate. You can live in comfort there. Then I'll fight them and prove who is right. Well said. That's the prince we respect. I'll be glad to die for you... and for the future of this country. Tama River, Outskirts of Edo Father, over there! Just in time. There's brother Jubei. Jubei, it's been a long time. Akane, no husband yet? The Negoro clan is here to help as you asked. We appreciate this opportunity. Thank you for coming so far. I have a surprise for you... good news. Jubei told me about your wish to return to your homeland. You will be able to. How? Prince Iemitsu is pleased with your help. He'll grant your wish if the trouble is settled. Really? He gave me his word. Sagenta, congratulations. I didn't expect it so soon. Thank you. I didn't do anything for you. You taught me how to fight as a ninja in Negoro. Negoro is my home too. - Let's dance, Jubei! - Join us. Who is that girl? She's a new fighter. She's called Mon. I see. Would you place her under my control for a while? What do you mean? I've been looking for a female fighter. She's exactly the type I want. Doi resigned from office complaining he was ill. He wanted to work for Tadanaga, who had returned to Suruga. Iemitsu assigned Matsudaira Izu as Chief Chamberlain, Yagyu as Inspector General, and reshuffled his cabinet to cope with Tadanaga. Thus both princes began to fight for the Shogunate. But then the nobles in Kyoto stood in their way. We've been here five days. We're too busy to spend our days chattering with you. When will His Majesty appoint Prince Iemitsu the new Shogun? Please answer clearly. Regent, please respond. All right, I'll have to see His Majesty personally. Set the date! We can't. Why not? As I said, the princes need to resolve this on their own. We can't take either side. His Majesty can't interfere in such frivolous matters. You mean you refuse us? No, no, we didn't mean that. His Majesty made a poem the other day... "Let us congratulate your glorious future. The voices of bamboo will sing forever." "Forever Bamboo" is another name for Prince Iemitsu. His Majesty wishes him a long life. How benevolent. Then why not appoint him as Shogun? What's funny? Excuse me. That was where we started this discussion. It's like a game, and we've gone all the way around the board. It's about time to pay a visit to Daitokuji Temple. Let us continue this discussion tomorrow. Who are they? The sons of Yagyu, Iemitsu?s fencing instructor. The famous Yagyu Shinkage School? How scary! Look at those long swords. They must be sharp. Brother, who is he? Ayamaro Karasumaru, the smartest man in the palace. "Smartest"? He makes me sick. At Sunpu Castle, Tadanaga's estate, Sunpu, Suruga many masterless samurai seeking opportunities are gathering, bringing with them an unusual amount of activity. Take me with you. Who is he? Amano from Chosokabe. Is he strong? He killed three commanders at the battle of Sekigahara. Five at Osaka. I heard he was killed in action at Osaka. Kanbei! If it isn't Kanbei! - You're alive? - You too? - Where did you come from? - Echizen. I can't die a beggar. This is my last chance. I can't sit still, so I hurried here. Let's go. Hurry and tell the boss. - What? - Idiot, don't you have ears? They came from Echizen too. More men will come. - What happens then? - It'll explode. The town will be overflow with samurai and explode. - What? What? - What's going on? You can't display your banners on our land. Take them down. We side with Prince Tadanaga. We're here to fight the government. We're ready to die for him. Thank you, but we can handle it ourselves. - What? - Pack up and get out of here. This is our place, so we won't take down our banners. Take them down yourself. Excuse me. Shozaemon Bekki, the commander of Suruga... you'll have to fight him. Remember how he fights. So this is war. This is war! * My homeland * * Is the land Izumo * * I look back at my homeland * * And it is spring in Kyoto * * Flowers are in full bloom * * Full bloom * * The color... * What did Izu and Kasuga say to you? They'd give us extra territory if we agree to make Iemitsu Shogun. How impudent. You didn't? They stayed two more days, but they returned to Edo empty-handed. They deserved it. Don't talk about politics here. Not now. It will be settled sooner or later. Enjoy the dance now. How beautiful Okuni is. * There's no moon tonight * * The flowers of ancient times * * Are not the same flowers * * A single flower viewing * * Is very melancholic. * Wonderful, Okuni. If you have time, dance at my castle in Owari too. Thank you very much, my lord. - Where is she? - There. Okuni, I've been happy these past six months. My only regret is I'm not a good flute player. Why do you say that? War will break out. You must leave this castle. I won't leave. - Okuni. - I'm a commoner. I can't say goodbye easily like a samurai. I won't bother you. Please let me stay near you. Try to understand... it was peaceful three months ago. I never imagined I'd fight my brother. Now I'm bearing the weight of millions of lives, not only the people on my land. I can't back out now. Prince. Excuse me, sir. Chamberlain Doi has arrived. Keep well. Good luck. I've been waiting. Iemitsu asked the Emperor to decide who is Shogun. I see, that's why the nobles are here in your castle. Yagyu and Izu thought of it. Your report? I've brought good news for you. We have two helpers. Go on. One is Lord Date in Sendai. He agreed to send his daughter to marry you. It proves his friendship. He has power. I'll persuade other powerful lords such as Mori and Maeda. Then all the local lords will come to join us. I'll leave for their castle immediately. Good. As soon as you return, I'll declare war. Who's the other helper? Prince Tadanaga. Who is he? Genshinsai Ogasawara, a master swordsman as famous as Yagyu. Genshinsai, answer me directly. What do you wish? Only one thing, Prince... when you become Shogun, I'd like you to employ me as your fencing instructor. What? It's not from greed. Kamiizumi Ise, my instructor, established the Shinkage School. I want to show my new Shinkage School is successor to his. Yagyu Shinkage School is no match for me! You sound promising. Your wish is granted. Thank you. I promise I'll kill Yagyu with my own hands. Sanza, are you still here? You were a soldier. You must be excited. Don't worry about me, just join the troops. Can I? Who'd play the flute for you? Who'd help you dance? People have begun to notice your talent. What good would that do? All men should die! Okuni, what were you talking about with Prince Tadanaga? I see. You bid him goodbye. None of your concern. Wait. I've decided. I won't go. I'll wait till you forget the prince. I'll keep playing the flute for you. Samon, Akane, what is it? My father's orders... we'll kill Doi tonight near the castle. There will be 10 of us. Will you choose eight of your men for us? - Yes. - Here's one! Choose seven. Yagyu's son? I'm Ayamaro Karasumaru. I will challenge you. Don't interrupt! Is that Yagyu Shinkage School? Die! Brother! Brother! How dare you?! You're a girl. Go away, I won't kill girls. - Samon! - Samon! - Attack! - Captain! - Over there! - What's going on? Stop fighting! Stop fighting! Stop fighting! Retreat! Retreat, retreat! Retreat! Get out of here! Retreat! - Get out of here! - Quick! Wait, wait, wait! Let's go, we're in a hurry. Don't pursue them. Wait, wait. Noisy girl, I'll teach you a lesson. She's good for a girl! I'm sorry we couldn't help you. We'll kill Doi without fail. You'd better go home. - I won't. - But... I'm determined. Until I kill Doi... I won't go home. Take this to my father in Edo. No, not me! I came to fight. I want to kill them. Please take it. Is that sissy noble so strong? I didn't know. Maybe he's too much for Akane to handle. I'll go. - Me too. - No. You must stay with Father. Thank you for coming so far. Tell Sagenta we're asking him to redouble his efforts. Yes, sir. Mon, you've changed. Hayate is surprised. Mon, starting tomorrow you'll work in the castle harem. I told Lady Kasuga about you. Your mission is to guard the prince. It's an important job. Do your best. Yes, sir. Yagyu, it's been a long time. Genshinsai? I want a match. Where's the dojo? I can't fight. Are you afraid? I'm the Shogun's fencing instructor. I'm not allowed to fight. The Shogun's instructor is the leader of swordsmen. You can't refuse. All right, I'll no longer consider you a swordsman. I offered you a chance to die like a swordsman. Jubei, you all right? It's nothing. I was able to cut him, but he's better than I heard. He's as good as I've heard. Very strong. It's Father. Welcome, Genshinsai. Please sit here. Please. Excuse me. When did you get here? I arrived this morning. Is that so? I'm glad to see you. The show starts soon. See for yourself how good an actor Yukinojo is. Hurry up and bring some tea. No, no, no, don't bother. I have a request to ask you. I want to talk. - Just us. - I understand. What do you want to talk about? Saruwaka... please return Yukinojo to me. What?! You want him to quit acting? Genshinsai, five years ago he dropped his sword and became an actor. You agreed to it, so I made him my apprentice. Now you suddenly want him to quit. There must be some reason. Please explain. My pride as a samurai. I have to kill my rival, Yagyu, and I need Yukinojo's help. I'm sorry to ask this, but please let me quit your troupe, Master. Can you leave behind what you've achieved with no regrets? I can't say I'll have no regrets. I won't forget your kindness either. But he saved my life. I was an orphan when he found me. I owe him my life. Please let me return his kindness. Genshinsai, you're cruel. Yukinojo was my only successor. To me, he was more than a son... he was an invaluable treasure. Master, thank you very much. The prince... is coming! Intruder! Attack! You impudent bastard! Prince! Prince! Attack! Attack! - You bastard! - Prince! You're not welcome here. Forgive me for not guarding you well. Don't mind me. Tend to her quickly. She covered me with herself. She saved my life. Yagyu sent her to protect you, Prince. Is that so? Yagyu, get a doctor for her. - Don't let her die. - Yes, sir. Are you all right? Does it hurt? - Show me the wound. - No. Don't. Show me. As I thought... he's a quack. Our medicine is much better. I'll go to Suruga with Jubei. I'll work as hard as you did. I won't see you for a while. Get well quickly. Hayate... Hayate... I wish you could stay. Me too, but we must be patient a little longer. We'll work hard... and we'll go back to Negoro together. Huh? But... take care of yourself. I know. Nobody can kill me. Goodbye. Minobu Road Halt. Everybody, be on alert! Protect our lord! All right. Akane! Akane! Akane! Akane! - Akane! - Akane! Don't cry. Don't cry! Don't cry!
