And give him his breakfast at 6 a.m., dinner at 12:30, and evening meal no later than 6 p.m. Make sure he gets a nice pudding with his supper. Give him a real taste of home. Alright? Keep the bedroom curtains closed at night. Two good pillows on the bed, and a decent set of clean bedding. Do a regular check on the bedroom. Make sure you know what he's up to in there. Keep it clean. Pens and paper will be provided for him to write letters. I want this wrapped up nicely by Christmas. Booze will be provided, but make it last. Don't get too familiar with him. You're there so he don't do anything stupid. You ain't his friend. Enjoy the piano. I thought a bit of a sing song might be nice. But no shouting or screaming. In the news tonight, police have issued an appeal for residents in the Dartmoor area to report anything suspicious following an escape by a dangerous prisoner. You can listen to the radio, but don't make a big thing of it, because if I say so, the wireless might have to go. Make sure he fully understands the telephone drill. Never let him pick it up. Any time now, John. Make sure the boy's happy. Keep it homely. I ain't gonna lie to you. He could snap you clean in half if he had reason to. Don't let him get out, and don't let me down. Comfy double bed, all to yourself. Nice, big bath for you to relax in. Sheer luxury, yeah? Kitchen's pretty basic, but I'm a good cook. I can do you a full English. Fancy a brew? I bet you're parched, yeah? Is this it then? Tea? We got coffee if you prefer coffee. Where's Ron with the champagne and the girls? We got cake. Cake? Yeah. What kind of cake? It's Battenberg. It's nice, it's sweet in that. Oh, Ron wanted you to have this. It's got chocolate coins inside. It tells you what day it is right up to Christmas day. And those ones have already been opened, I think Ron got a bit peckish. Oh, you can have these ones. That one's yesterday's and this one's today's. I can count. So he'll be here soon then? Eh? Ron. I- And this must be the kind of cake you have at parties. Even the Queen of England's partial to a nice bit of Battenberg. I don't suppose you get much cake inside unless there's a file in it. Mate. I was about to pass it to you. I never seen a pink cake before. Well, you have now. So, is there any more? It's all yours if you want it. What about Ron? Don't we need to save him some? Nah, nah, nah. You eat it. Hey. I thought I'd fix us up a proper drink. Large whisky on the rocks. You like the sound of that, yeah? Nicely stocked bar. Got coasters, straight from the twin's club. You've got ice, mixers, it's all set up for you. So, what time is he getting here? We'll know when Ron rings. You want ice in it? Frank. You're not in handcuffs. Cool it, sit down. Have some ice. Ooh. Well? Answer it. When the phone rings, you're meant to pick it up. We have to wait for the signal. Why don't you just pick it up? I don't know it's him. We'll know if they ring back. We have to stick to the rules. I don't want to speak to you, I want to speak to Ron. Mate, you have to trust me. You ain't my mate, I don't even know you! Leave it! Frank, just give me the phone! So that's how it's gonna be, Frank. You ignoring the rules. Picking up the phone like that, not clever. So, inside, what would you normally be doing? Come on, Frank, try and relax. Where's my fuckin' party, Ron! Stop it! The phone? Oh yeah, come on. Here we go. Let go! Frank, I can't fucking breathe, leave it out! Keep still. Don't you fuckin' move. Don't move. Don't you fuckin' move, all right? Here you go. There you are. - What the fuck, Frank? - There you are. What are you doing? Come on, come on, all right? Come on. I want you to come at me like you're gonna kill me. Come at me. - Oh, Frank, I- - Come at me. Fuck. Come at me! Look, I'm taking this off. No, leave it! It looks good. All right, come at me. Come on! Oh, fuck- Do it! We've gotta keep the noise down. I've gotta be ready for when Ron rings. Come on! Come on! Pick it up. No, Frank. We have to wait for the signal. Stupid. It stopped now. It rings twice, then it stops like now, then it rings again. Ring, ring. Yeah? Then it stops. Frank, it's very important you understand it. Just answer it. Tell Ron to get around here at the party. Then it rings again. Ring, ring. Now I know it's them. I pick it up, Frank. Me. Never you. All right. Ron wants you to have a nice bit of steak with your supper. You fancy a juicy steak? Frank! Yes, he's looking forward to it. All right. All right. Bye. It's your first big day of freedom tomorrow, and Ron wants you to enjoy it. So he ain't coming. He's letting you settle in first. In the country, I'm expecting a grand affair this Christmas. Yeah? Ron promised me the lot. Anything I want. Make a list, he said. I hope you put down a sports car. Turkey. As big as a dog. Veg, the full works. Carrots, sprouts, two lots of spuds. Mash, roasties. And then you got your stuffing, cranberry sauce, and the grand finale, the Christmas pudding. Oh, you gotta light it. Ooh, but you need a steady hand for that, sunshine. Oh, bosh! Generous dollop of cream on top. Mm! Lovely. ♪ Fresh from the titty sitting pretty ♪ ♪ On top of the Christmas hood ♪ Do you know how to milk a cow, John? Can't say that I do. Neither do I, but when I get down to the country I'm gonna learn. When you meet a fella for the first time, it's only right to shake hands. How do you do? My name's Frank. Now you tell me your name, John. Howdy, Frank. I'm John. Now can you release your grip of steel? I've got a nice steak dinner to prepare. Frank. Frank, what are you playing at? Come on. You have to keep it down, John. You don't want to wake the neighbors. Frank. Frank, look. I'm freezing me nuts off in here. Fuck, fuck. I heard someone moving around. I need to see who it was. I was just taking a piss. So, where is it? What? I can't see it. See what? Are you fucking stupid? You really should have your gun on you at all times, John. Yes, I should. Someone might find it, and then what? I made it to bring with me. Carved it out of a piece of wood. Hid it for weeks without anybody even knowing it was there. Without the bleeding trigger, it fooled you good and proper. And if it really was a real gun, I would've shot you by now. I'm just playing with you, John. This ain't a game. Air force helicopters swept over the bleak countryside of Dartmoor, as the hunt continued for a prison escapee regarded as one of the most violent convicts in Britain. He is 37 year old Frank Mitchell, known as the "Mad Axeman", who slipped away from a working party outside the walls of Dartmoor Prison at dusk yesterday. Some 300 police and marine commanders are taking part in the search on the ground. Yes! Police sworn their own men not to individually tackle the convict, who is 6'2 inches tall, weights 16 stones, and has a reputation for violence. And was sick of waiting for his parole date! Frank! Do you want the bleeding neighbors to hear everything? Yeah! I want everyone to hear! Well, you know what you need to do now then, yeah? So, are you ready to tell Britain what its most famous outlaw wants? You bet I am. You're all over the news. You've gotta strike while the iron's hot, mate. You do one letter, you copy it three times. We send one to the home secretary, the others go to the Times and the Mirror. Before they go into papers, Ron's gotta check them over. And this is your chance to tell people what you want. I want 100 quid and a gun. I think that's perfectly reasonable. Be serious, Frank, come on. Why did you escape? They said if I behaved meself, I'd get my parole date. Did you get it? No. 4 years I waited, they gave me nothing. Every fucker in there knew when they was gonna be free. But not you. I was the only one they kept in the dark, the only one without a parole date. Don't tell me. Get it written down. And you really think they'll print it? Mate. Everyone in Britain will want to read it. You're right, even me dad. And he oughta be proud of you. Yeah. So, it's gotta be good, it's gotta be right, John. First you need to tell them why you escaped, and then what you want, and then this is important, Frank. They need to know if you're a danger to the public, yeah? John, if anyone comes at me, I'm gonna sort them. No messin', right? So you're gonna put that down? "You hit me and I'll whack you back." Frank, this isn't prison, this is the real world. Wake up, Frank. This is your life on the line here. All right? How do you spell maniac, John? Maniac? Yeah, sex maniac. What are you putting that down for? 'Cause I'm telling them that I'm not a murderer or a sex maniac. All right, all right, calm down. In the car on the way here, we went over Bow Bridge. I said to the guy, "Me dad and all me family live in Bow." And he brought me straight here. Do you have family, John? We gotta concentrate on getting this done. Let me see what you wrote down so far. Oh, could you imagine their faces when I walk in the door? Some of this is spelt wrong. Yes, teamwork Frank- Ron told me I get to see my family. Well, if you get these letters right, you will soon enough. It's gotta be neater though. See, what does this say? And then this one? Nothing, no. Wait. Look, me arm's aching now. That's because you got wheely bleedin' arms. Aye! Just get it down. All right, just write it out again, only neater. You're a smart guy, Frank. You know what you're doing. Write it, send it, bingo. Headline bleedin' news. "Sir. The reason for my absence from Dartmoor was to bring to the notice of my unhappy plight." And I think you're gonna like this next bit. "To be truthful, I'm asking for a possible date of release. From the age of..." This is great. "From the age of 9, I've not been completely free. Always under some act or other. Sirs, I ask you, where is the fairness of this? I'm not a murderer, or a sex maniac, nor do I think I'm danger to the public. I think that I've been more than punished for the wrongs I've done." "I'm ready to give myself up if I can have something to look forward to." "I do not intend to use violence at any time should I be found. That is why I left a knife behind with my prison friends. Yours Sincerely, Frank Mitchell." It's nearly Christmas, John. Everyone's out there having fun. Except me. I wrote the bleeding letters, I stuck to my side of the bargain. It's a waiting game, mate. Come on. Eat your supper. What are they playing at? When am I gonna be free? I don't know, Frank. If Ron can't come to me, I'll go to him. Yeah? Yeah. I'm gonna take my chances out there. First copper I see, I'll sort them so they know I mean business. And how long do you think you'll survive? If you give me your gun. You have to trust us, Frank. Frank, your supper's getting cold. Here. I've come up with a plan for getting out there, and without anybody even knowing that it's me, yeah? Go on. When Ron came to visit me in Dartmoor he was in disguise. Tash, glasses, the lot. At first, no fucker recognized him, not even me. I'm being serious. Oh, right. Yeah, so? So, I can go out there in disguise, as somebody else. How are you gonna do that? You can give me all I need. Hat, coat, maybe a false beard, specs. No one's getting out of here. They've locked that door from the outside, end of. You can always ring Ron. Jesus Christ, Frank. Why can't you just be happy with what you've got? Trust me, things could be a lot worse for you. After dinner, why don't you have a bath, there's plenty of hot water. You can take the brandy in there with you, you can lie back and sing to your heart's content. Sounds nice. Good. I'll get a towel. I think you should treat yourself to a good soak, John. Me?, nah, I'm all right. Thanks, I gotta go the washing up. It'll be nice, and relaxing. Go on. Go and run yourself a nice, hot bath. No. Come on. You deserve it, you know you want to. No, I don't. I thought you would. No, John. Go and run yourself a bath. And when you're all relaxed, you give me shout, yeah? What? And I'll come in. Eh? I'll come in, and I'll hold your head under! Get off me! Oh, you gotta understand how I feel, John. It's Christmas out there. I just wanna do all the stuff that any normal fella would be doing. You ain't a normal fella, mate. What are you saying? You're Britain's most dangerous man. On your feet, get up. I only tickled you. Come on, you big sissy. Frank, that fuckin' hurt. What are you playin' at? I'm only here 'cause of you. Well, this ain't good enough. What more do you want? They ring you 10 times a day, I've been answering that bleeding phone. I don't bleeding care, I'm bored. You need to realize what people are risking here. You need to shut it and do what I want for a change! Bleedin' heck! Yeah, baby, ride me, ride me! Get off! Come on, John, we need a fuckin' laugh! Well, I ain't laughing! Let me hear it! Ride me, baby! - Let me hear you, come on! - Get off! Do you surrender?- Don't be daft, get off. Go and eat your supper! Oh, what would you do if the cops came in the door right now? It's a bit hard for me to do anything with you on top of me. Fuck's sake! Jesus! Fuckin' come on! Shh. Listen. That sound's from upstairs, going out to have fun. You need to calm down. I need a car bringing round. I'm going out to see Ron! I thought he'd come and see me. Come on. You need to be careful about what you promise. Eh? You said when they print the letters, something would have to happen! So why the fuck am I still here, John? Aye? This ain't freedom! I'm sick of it! Shit. Is it Ron? Shut up. Fuck. Or maybe it's the old Bill. Stand back. Let him have it! You do it, just get under the fuckin' table! So, where is he? What the fuck have we got here? I beg your pardon? Who the hell are you? Well, it's a good job I ate before I came. Clearly the chef's not up to much. So, you better get out from under there and taste what's for dessert. So, where's that famous face then, eh? Fuckin' hell! It's a blonde! Yes, that's more like it! Come on! Well, I'm pleased to meet you too. I'm Lisa. So, did they tell you I escaped from Dartmoor. Yeah. Well, your face is all over the papers. I saw that letter you wrote. Lisa, a drink, yeah? And Frank, look at the state of you, why don't you go and get yourself cleaned up. Yeah, right. Stay there, yeah? Look, darling. You turning up banging on about those letters is the last thing I bleeding need. Right. Well, I can stay one night, and cheer him up a bit. But like I told Reg, first thing tomorrow I'm out of here. Oh, for fuck's sake, you only just got here. Shush. Don't you shush me. And I don't appreciate you swearing at me either. I just think we need to be straight with him. Well, you're not paid to think, are you? So get to it and cheer the fucker up. You need to learn some manners. You need to do your job. I'm here as a favor to Reg. He came to see me at the club. I'm actually a dancer. Yeah? Well, I don't see you dancing yourself rich. And how much are they paying you, John? So, Lisa. How do you know the twins? She works at Winston's, Frank. Oh. And they told me you like blondes. So that's lucky isn't it? Yeah. You see this? I can lift this no problem. Frank! Watch the China, mate. Oh. It's a shame we don't have a decent piano player in the room. Frank. Why don't we take our drinks into the bedroom? I bet it's much cozier. We can leave Tinkerbell here to clean up this mess. Very good. And we won't be needing this. The bleeding animals. Heaven almighty. Come on, John! Hey! Wait. Yeah! Who are they? Yeah! Woo! Senorita! Woo! Relax, John. Finally the guy's having some fun. Hey, Frank! Shake them hips, baby! Love it, sweetheart. What are you trying to do? Tire him out for round two? Mind you, for a guy like Frank, 9 years is a long time. Yeah. For a guy like Frank, 9 seconds is a long time. Woo! But the home secretary reiterated his earlier statement to the House. That the government would not be blackmailed by an escaped convict. Oh, you fuckers. A reward of 500 pounds has been offered to anyone with information leading to Mitchell's capture. Nice. In other news, Christmas shoppers in Oxford Street were today making last minute purchases. Ooh! Oh. Frank. Oh! That's a smashing photo of you, Frank. Blimey. They're all out there in the cold looking for the "Axeman", and where the heck is he? Here, tucked up safe and warm with me. Tomorrow when Ron rings, I'll tell him to send us a car. I want to take you home to meet my mother. Shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's well happy with the girl. Nah, nah, he's sound asleep. Nah, I haven't told him anything about what's his face, that mug, the home secretary. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll tell him you're pleased. Yeah. Stupid fuckin'... Fuckin' stupid fuck. Oh fuckin' stupid fuck. Bloody fuckin'... Fuckin' piece of fuckin'... Lisa? Here we go. Where's Lisa, John? I don't know, mate. She must've nipped home. How come she gets to go home and I don't? She thought she was only staying one night. You know what women are like, Frank. She just wanted to look nice for you you. So, is she my girl or not? I wish she would've told me. You and me both, pal. I would've gone with her. Well, you know what women are like. Why don't you go and have a shave and I'll iron you a clean shirt. But how did she get out? Listen. You don't need to worry about that. They sorted it. All you need to know is that she's coming back, so you should go and get ready for her. Do you have a girl? No. I got three sisters and no mother. Minding you is a bleedin' holiday, Frank. If she don't come back, I'm going to Vallance Road, and I'm going to scare Ron's mother. I bet your sisters put you in dresses, or ribbons in your hair, because you're a puff. Ron ain't gonna be happy. You know what happened to the last fella who let him down? He disappeared, never to be heard of again. If Lisa don't come back, you're dead, pal. Someone's been careless, John. Someone's been forgetful. Leaving things behind. But you're lucky that I found it. If you found it, you'd of been tempted to use it, princess. Give it to me. Well... Do you like the color? Frank, I fuckin'... Put it on, puff boy. Be reasonable, Frank. You let her walk out of here. She left this because she's coming back. Stop lying. I don't trust dirty liars. Gun, John. Give me the gun. What's this all about? I'm on your team. Would you trust a dirty liar with a gun? We need to think smart here. You're right, we do. Give me your gun. Frank. You, you're staying here. Who are they after? Am I an axeman or some lousy cook? Frank, just stay put. Give me the shooter. Frank. Shh. I got this covered, you get in the bedroom. So your girl comes back. You're carrying a gun wearing a bleeding mask, some sort of welcome, nice. I said get in the fuckin' bedroom! Are you fucking stupid, taking out the bullets? Aw, what's the matter? A loaded gun is too heavy for little puff boy? You think I'm stupid enough to carry a loaded gun when you're about? Do you hear what I said? It's gone quiet. Too quiet. Panic over. It's safe to come out now, Frank. I'm gonna count to 100. And if Lisa ain't back, I'm gonna smash the window, John, with your pretty little head. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 22. 23. 24. 50. 51. 52. 53. Frank, calm the fuck down. She's not worth getting caught for. She's just a bleedin'... All right, Frank. She's here. Frank, she's back. 99. 100. Look what the fucking cat dragged in. Where the hell were you? I'm gonna tell Ron you left. Who do you think gave me a lift back, you idiot? It's no big deal, only went to change me clothes. It's a shame they won't let you pop off. Shut up. The twins need to know you are a fuckin' liability. Liability? I don't think so. They know it's you who winds him up. I go away for a few hours, and all hell breaks loose! Because you cleared off, so just shut it. Yeah, well, like I told him in the car, I don't know why you're here, 'cause you can't handle him. We were doing fine before you turned up. Oh, shut it. Get out of my way, let me deal with him. Fuck you! I'm gonna ring Ron. I should get the phone off him then. Oh, shit, fuck us, fuck. Frank? I told you she'd come back. Your girlfriend's here. Come on, mate. Just open that door and give me the phone. You ain't my mate! When you get in there, just remember this. Mouth shut, legs open. Frank, I'm back. Can I come in? Look, he's barricaded himself in. Frank. A girl goes to a lot of trouble to impress a fella. The least you could do is let her in. You left me! Bleedin' heck! Oh, shit! Well, don't just stand there! Frank! I want this door opening, or I'll go for good this time. And I want that phone. Do you hear me, Frank? Yeah, Ron. Everything's tickety-bleedin'-boo. Yeah, the girl's back. Come here! Oh, what a week it's been! Bar's emptied before closing. Men staying in to keep their families safe? Lock up your daughters! Lock up your tool sheds. Choppity chop. Well, he's still out there, ain't he? In bed the other night, I says to the missus, if a wild-eyed fella barged in here wielding a ruddy great chopper wanting his wicked way with ya, what would you do? "Husband" she said, "I'd do what I do most nights. I'd close me eyes and think of England." Hell, it's scary, ain't it? Especially for the ladies. And then there's the mother-in-law. I say in-law, more like outlaw. Oh, oh, don't go laugh! I find that, well, it should be against the law. The old mare is so scared of that flaming axeman, she's popping by more often. God, I do hope they find him soon. You okay, Frank? And the poor blighter wrote them letters of appeal, didn't he? But the home secretary refuses to be blackmailed. Cor blimey, you don't want to go upsetting the fella with a real ax to grind. That ain't funny. You know it's on your mind. The last time I met you, I was a brunette. Well, I guess your face just ain't that memorable, darling. You used to play the piano down in that club. I got promoted. What's your excuse? The twins don't trust birds, neither do I. Oh, I gets it. You're one of Ron's special friends. No. Anyways, there's good news. Reg and the boys are coming over, so thank fuck you came back, eh? And does Frank know? Not yet. They're coming over tonight. Well, he'll be pleased. So, is Reg bringing me money? This ain't about you, Lisa. He's coming to see Frank. You know, Frank, I can honestly say you're the strongest man I've ever known. You've always been big? As a kid, tall and that. I'm sure I left my lipstick here. How many was there? What? Before me. Huh? Men. It must be in the bathroom. You just said I'm the strongest man you've ever known. Yeah, you are. So, how many men have you known? Frank! Come on. Reg is gonna be here soon. Right, I'm going to the bathroom. What are they paying you? Eh? To be here with me. What? Ow, Frank, let go. How much each time? You're being silly now. How much per fuck? Well? They are paying you, the twins. No! Well, yes, but only me expenses. So, how much are they paying you, Lisa? How much each time we fuck? All the time I'm here I'm not getting me wage from the club. And that's all. Honey, I can't find my lipstick. Have you seen it? How well do you know the twins? I just told you, I work at the club. You fuck, I kill. I'm a dancer. And that's all. Now stop this! Come here. You fastened your shirt up wrong. I'm not stupid, can do it myself. When you first got here, did you look for an ax under the bed? Of course I did. The lads will be here soon, Frank. Reg don't want to see any women at the moment, so when he gets here, make sure you stay in the bedroom. ♪ John ♪ When Reggie gets here, I need to tell him about Lisa. Yeah? - What about her? - A man's getting married. Eh? I love it! Bring it on, John. Oh, do you know what? When Reggie gets here, I'm gonna challenge him to an arm wrestle, hmm? Come on, hm? Nice. Come on! Get it, have it! Have it, come on! Come on! Come on, son! Come on! Come on, mate, yes! He's a strong one, Reg, he's a strong one. He's not too bad. Where'd you find him, Reggie, come on. Come on, come on! Yes, come on! Come on, son, come on, son! Yes! Beautiful. Let's get some more fuckin' drinks in. Courtesy of Reggie. I hope he's not telling Reg he wants to marry me. Get that down your neck. Christ, John! I hope they've told you how long we're gonna be stuck here. Taste it. Go on. I ain't put poison in it, yet. Oh, right. I've gotta get back in there. Yeah, so have I. Lisa! He ain't in the position to listen to anyone right now, he's dealing with Frank. Yeah, well don't worry, 'cause I know how to make him bloody listen. Right now it'll take a lot more than a great pair of tits, darling. You're still sulking about me leaving. I should've known. The first rule of hooker school, plan your escape route. Keys in the toby jug on top of the old Johanna. It's a bit obvious, piano man. They've never let me down before. You gonna stop me now? It ain't loaded. What the fuck are you playing at? Get your hands off me! I'm going to speak to Reg! No, you're gonna stay here and do as you're told! You're pathetic. How'd they persuade you to come back? Face it... You're here for the duration, just like me. Fuckin' prick. Did you see that fat one sweating? Like a pig he was, his face! Then he exploded! Yes! I showed him, John. I showed Reg and the boys. Did you see their faces? They was amazed, they couldn't believe how strong I am! I'm the best arm wrestler in Britain, that's what Reg said. Champion amongst men. Go on, feel that muscle. Fuckin' feel it! Oh, that's impressive. Now Reg filled you in on everything now, Frank. You see how we're all on your side now? I'm gonna be Ron's right hand man, John. Yes. Yes! Yes! Yes! Frank! Oh! Hey, John. How about you ring Reg and ask him to meet down at the club for a drink, aye? Oh, for God's... Look at his face. It gets him every time, every time. All over Britain he's known as the "Mad Axeman". But to one man, he's simply "Our Frank". Hello, Frank. Pop here. Mom wants to say hello and let you know she's in good health. How you went from being a kid stealing a two bob bike to being this "Axeman", I don't know. You made a good attempt putting your side across the newspapers, but now this must be dealt with swiftly. You've done all you could, son. Do the right thing, boy. Hand yourself in. Your dad sounds like a really lovely man. I'm gonna let you in on a secret. Ron's sortin' it. We're gonna spend Christmas together out in the country. Me, Ron, and some of the boys. Oh, sounds lovely, that. Well, I'll let you in on a secret. I know you wouldn't think it to look at me, but, I'm a country girl at heart. When I was a lass I used spend me summers running wild on the moors. Well, that settles it. Don't you worry, Lisa. I'll fix it for you to come too. Right, quick, Frank. Close your eyes. Oh. Ta-da! Wow! Bloody hell, John. Lovely. Great, John. That's great! Roasted. Beautiful. Thank you, John. And a bit of mash. It's crispy. Two types of spuds, yeah? Great, John. That is beautiful. Lovely. Oh, that's gorgeous. Come on, bring it back, get back for more, come on. Grab it. Oh, yes. All right, Lisa. Come on. Yay, Frank! Yes! Champion amongst men, aye? At what? I told ya! - Aye, let's make a toast. - Lovely. Look at that. All right. To Reg and Ron. The best friends a fella could ever have. - Cheers. - Cheers. Lovely. Come here. Pinky. Can you guess what I wished for? You and me, out in the country already. Your blonde hair, all lit up in the sun. Come on. Heads, I win, tails, you lose. Eh? Oh. Tails. You win, mate. That was a champion meal, John. You finally like my cooking, do ya? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I like the cooking. But I don't like you keeping secrets from me. You weren't honest about the letters, John. You should've told me people were laughing at me, made me look like a fool. Oy, not true. The only fool in everyone's eyes is the home secretary. People are still on your side, trust me. You did a great job with it, Frank. Even your old man said so. Right. You better not be keeping anymore secrets, yeah? Aye, where's the bleeding radio gone? Oh, the battery's run out, mate. Ron sent you this. Oh. Nice. Frank. What if your old man was right? You could still hand yourself in. You could do it. Don't be stupid. Think about it, mate. It's not too late. They got into his head. They made my dad say that. Oh, shit. Where's the maintenance gone? Oh, that's great. I haven't got any change, have you? No. Well, where's Frank? I dunno, he was just here. Oh, bloody hell. Oh, for fuck's sake. I ain't never going back. So, what's the plan? They're taking him to a big house in the country. They told me. Oh, I bet it's lovely out there on the hills. Especially this time of year. Oh, God. What now? He thinks I'm going with him. John, look at me. They can't make me go with him, can they? When the time comes, you'll be told that for safety reasons you'll be following later. But I don't have to go? You sure there really is a big house? Lisa, the twins say there's a house, then there's a house, and it's big. I need you to wear this so nobody recognizes you. Tell Lisa that for safety reasons she'll be joining you later. Mm. You say your goodbyes to her then. Get ready. Mhm. When the van's brought around, I'll come and get ya. - Frank? - Mm. You need to leave all your other kit behind. Yeah. I'm gonna need new clothes for the country. Waistcoat and that. Frank's in the bathroom waiting to say goodbye. Whatever he tells you, go along with it. Lisa. You've been brilliant, doll. Oh, there she is. Here's trouble. Come here. Now, for safety reasons, it's best that you stay here for a while. And then one of the boys will drive you down later. But John will look after you. Hold on. I want you to have this, hm? But I don't want you to read what's inside until after I've gone. All right? Before I go, I want to tell you something, Lisa. You don't have to worry, all right? I ain't a bad man. I never killed anybody. Frank. You were inside a long time. I mean it, Lisa. The only reason they call me the "Axeman"... It's stupid, really, but, when I escaped a few years back, the first place we came to, we saw this shed, and we busted a lock to get inside to the tools we needed. But this dog just starts barking, and I don't trust dogs. And the fella I was with, he grabs this ax, and he does what he does. But he tells everyone it was me. He's just told me everything, John. He reckons he ain't no "Axeman". No. What is he then, the milkman? He don't like being called the "Axeman". No? It's a bit late for all that. It doesn't matter now. Of course it bloody matters! He made this out of a woman's nightie. This girl gave it to him because he said he wanted to make a wash bag. Ain't that right, Frank? Am I allowed to take that with me? No. Come on, Frank, it's time to get ready. Frank, I just wanted to tell you that- Lisa, he ain't got time. Christmas in the country, aye? Must be lovely, all the hills covered in snow. Frank, go and get changed. It don't fit right, John. I'm keeping me own trousers on. What don't fit him? Nothing. Come on, get on with it. Frank, wait. Lisa. I just want to kiss you goodbye. Aw. Ain't she something. She certainly is. Look after her, John. Remember, Frank. When you're in the country, you ain't no bleeding "Axeman". You're a real gent. They are gonna look after him, right? Yeah, he'll be all right. Go and wait in the bedroom. When it's all over, I'll come and get you. Happy Christmas. Wagon's roll! Oi!, what are you playing at? John, do you hear that? When we're done here, you gotta go to a Christmas party. Someone will come get you. Reg will be there. He'll give you your money. Fuck. No, John. Can you read it to me? "To Lisa. The only girl who I've ever loved. Happy Christmas, Frank." Look, he's put his thumbprint. Happy Christmas, Frank. Champion amongst men. Ho, ho, fuckin' ho. I don't want to go to Reggie's party on me own. Just do what I say. I know what they're capable of. John, will you stay with me? Let there be light. It's Christmas day. Please don't leave me on my own with any of them. Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere. Subtitles by explosiveskull
