We approve You have our lives in your hands We will do as you say You understand? Thank you, then l came alone as l promised What do you want to sell me? Kumokiri's true identity Not a bad deal But l do not want money for it Who are you? You tell me, or the deal is off l'm the masseur l was at the Musashi-ya What masseur? What did you see? Though l am blind l can see who Kumokiri is Do you really know? Ten years ago... l was a samurai with the Owari Clan My name was Sajuro Tomizuka What destroyed me was the embezzlement of... The accountant, Kuranosuke Tsuji Kuranosuke Tsuji, the accountant. You embezzled the clan's funds... And you refuse to admit it... Because of your shameless conduct... You are sentenced to commit hara-kiri... Your house will be abolished... And your family will be most severely punished. Signed: Tsugutomo Owari. But Kuranosuke and his brother lori... Refused to obey and fled Eight samurai were selected... l was one of them... To find and kill the two We staked our lives on this mission Several hours later... l awoke to find... The Tsuji brothers both gone... lf l returned l would be punished... So l took the heads of my comrades... And disguised them as heads of the Tsuji brothers lt was the only thing for me to do Yes, the only way l could have saved myself Seven men were killed by these two? Yes, l apologize Well, it's over now And no one else knows, right? Certainly, sir We are grateful Give me those heads l'm beginning to understand what you really want l will help you to get it But l have one condition l know Kumokiri's head... You want it, don't you? Edo Castle Shikibu... You've failed to foil these robberies... The elders have strongly reprimanded you... Yet you refuse to retire... You have courage, and l admire it Have you any prospects? Of course, sire l have almost discovered who this Kumokiri is And l have a man who can identify him What's that? A man who was an Owari clan samurai Ten years ago there was an embezzlement case... ln the Owari clan lt is my guess that Kumokiri is connected with us l have begun to suspect the connection lf you are that confident... Then l have no more to say But, Shikibu... You are certainly some samurai... l am a member of the Shogun's council... And my political life is in your hands Yes, sir l am sorry, sire You've betrayed me l want to see a higher magistrate Stop! You're only to be exiled, you're lucky Hi! Yes Concerning our Owari investigations... We have no idea where Kumokiri will next attack... But this time we must get him, no matter what This may be the worst case we've ever had l am prepared, sir. He is the worst criminal ls law, breaking always evil, l wonder... And are law, abiding citizens always right? Listen, this is only an assumption... But if you were told to kill yourself... For a false charge... lf even your most distant kin were punished... And the woman you loved taken away... What then would you do? lf such a man then hates the government... And dares go against its laws... Can we then arrest him so easily...
