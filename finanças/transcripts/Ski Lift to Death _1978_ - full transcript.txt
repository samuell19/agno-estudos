[music playing] [horn blowing] (SINGING) Coming down the mountain when she comes. She'll be coming down the mountain when she comes. She's a queen of the skis when the race [inaudible]. She'll be coming down the mountain when she comes. Whatever else Silver City is, it's still a small western town that loves its own. And we love Lee Larson, right? Yeah! Who only five days ago won the World Freestyle Cup competition in Stowe, Vermont. From the train station, this is Andrea Mason reporting. Glad to be home? Oh, yeah. [applause] There he is. Hey. How you doing? Hey, I want to meet Marv Gilman. My father. - How are you, Mr. Larson? Mr. Gilman. Look, I'll get your luggage. - Yeah? - Yeah. Let's go. [applause] How you doing, sheriff? Hi there. All ready for the weekend? - Yeah. Well, he's working on the jump. Shouldn't be any problems. How about you? Oh, just a lot of folks having a good time. OK. I'll see you later. Right. Hey, Lee. Hi. Hey, I saw you on television from Stowe. You were terrific. Well, I was lucky that everything went all right. Oh, excuse me. I'd like to to meet Marv Gilman. Marv, Andrea Mason. Hi, how are ya? I'm fine, thanks. Good. Does this mean there's a new Gilman client in the offing? Oh, no, no. I met Marvin at Stowe. We traveled back together. He's here for the the North End Jumping Competition. Excuse me. Um, would you hold this for me, Pop? Sure. Oh! God, I missed you. I almost skipped Stowe. Yeah? Aw, come here. I wouldn't be surprised if that were Dick Elston. Well, it's always been Dick Elston. Come on, let's get out of here. - Oh-- - Yeah. Come on, come on. Let's go. They had their crack at you. Now it's my turn. You wanna know what I've been doing for those three weeks while you've been, uh, skiing up a storm in Vermont, Pennsylvania, Michigan? Hm? I mean, besides going crazy? What are you talking about? Come on, I'll show ya. But Dick, the people. The people are fine. They're OK. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Where are you taking me? Big surprise. One of those childhood sweetheart romances, Mr. Gilman. The kind that always ended with "and they lived happily ever after." Until it went out of fashion. Have you got a car? At your service. It's over here. See ya later, Mr. Larson. Sure thing. [phone ringing] - Hello? - Hello, Dad. I'm at the Mother Lode. I just drove up. Look, can you, uh-- can you come over and meet me? It's kind of important. Well, come over here. No. No, uh-- look, it just concerns you and me. I'd rather Vicki not come over, OK? [dialtone] Whatever happens, we'll be OK. MAN: Old Corgan's place. WOMAN: Your father? Well, I couldn't fight [inaudible], but I leased it. With the option to buy. I've been working on that place every single night, my days off, ever since you went away. You gotta see some of the furniture I made. Do you have any specific plans for Lee? Oh, yeah. Lots of 'em. But so, evidently, does Mr. Elston. Dick's going to be a tough man to beat. If you ever saw him in competition, you'd know what I mean. I know about Elson. World Cup Racing Tour five years ago. Three major freestyle championships. Did you ever ask him why he quit? Yeah, sure. Got a lot of talk about basics. Meaning probably that he's just not as greedy as the rest of us. [car horn] Hey, what's that car following us for? Huh? Oh, Dick, I'm supposed to be at the lodge cocktail party for the manufacturers. I promised. Aw, Lee, come on. Those parties are so boring. Everybody's running around promoting. Yeah. Hey, I can see Corgan's place tonight. Well, Gilman's told a lot of reps I'd be there. He's been really nice to me. OK. [car horn] Hi. You haven't forgotten about the party, have you? Oh, no. I'll be right with you. - OK. Well, uh, we'll wait for you. - Come on with us. - No thanks. I've been there. I'll see you later. We've got a lot of catching up to do. John? Well Dad, I hope I didn't interrupt anything. Well? OK, I talked to the DA. He says we both have to be in front of that grand jury on Monday morning or there's no deal. I mean, my testimony alone just isn't gonna make it. If I refuse? Well, then they're gonna prosecute. Now, extortion's a federal rap. That's 10 years. 10 years? No way. Well, I want out now. You know who we're dealing with. Don't you realize what'll happen to us if we talk? Dad, this is your chance. It's our chance. I mean, it's the only one we're ever going to get. Look, uh, John, check into the hotel. Buy yourself some clothes. Rent some skis. Relax. We'll talk about it. You mean you're going to talk to Vicki? You're damn right I will. Well, I'm sorry. OK, you go ahead and you talk to Vicki. Just don't expect me to hang around while you do it, OK? Because I intend on being in front of that grand jury Monday morning, with or without you. - That gets you nothing. It's suicide. Well I guess, then, my life's in your hands, huh? Champagne? Mr. Corley? I'm Andrea Mason with Q Local Affiliate Station. It's the pleasure. The name's Ron. Ron. Thank you. Interesting gathering. A mixture of money and talent. Some of the best competitors in the world are here. Are you covering the competition tomorrow? No. I'll leave that to your network boy. You know, what I need is to get to know the town better. How can I? Have me show it to you. Why didn't I think of that? Oh, so the kid finally made it, huh? Thanks. You know, it's hard to believe that all those crazy things we did on skis would lead us to this. Really. Speaking of crazy stuff, where did you pick up that handstand? I saw you do it at Stowe, and I couldn't believe it. I don't know. It, uh-- it just sort of happened. I was doing gymnastics this summer. If I got in that position, I'd never get back up. Hey, how's your triple coming? Well, I've got it in mind, and I've done it off the trampoline and the diving board, but I'm just waiting for the right time, the right conditions, you know what I mean? - Yeah. Excuse me, Lee? Uh, somebody over here I want you to meet. - Oh. - How are you doing, cowboy? - All right. - Um-- - See you in a bit. - Bye. Pardon me. How are ya? Right over here. Hey, Don. Hey, Marv. How are you? Good. How are you? The lovely Lee Larson. Lee, Don Harwell, president of Leisure Hours Industries, and sponsor of our north am tomorrow. Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Harwell. All mine, Miss Larson. Say, thanks for contributing your ski ballet to our festivities here this weekend. Thank you. We've got a new pair of goggles for you. Oh, yeah? How good are they? Well, pocket money good. But if you win tomorrow, could get better. How much better? I mean, how good are these endorsements these days? 40,000 plus. [whistle] We're looking forward to seeing you at Tahoe. I'm afraid not this year. Well, we're going to be introducing a new trick. It's called, uh, the Mule Kick. And, uh, by the way, about that time a certain canned cocktail company is going to be introducing a new drink. It's also called a Mule Kick. First prize is worth $25,000. Mr. King, I don't intend to sell booze to kids. But thank you. Look, Lee, I didn't mean anything by that. And she's, uh-- she's kind of tired. She's been working. Let me, uh-- let me call you tomorrow. I'll call ya. Yeah, OK. Is that about it? Well, Silver City won't go away. Uh, why don't you keep me company? Come on. Come on. What do you want from me, Marv? I mean, it's not money. Not with all the superstars we're surrounded with. Oh, now wait, wait, wait. Wait. Not all those. They're just people. You know? They're special. Real special people. And when one of 'em gets a club pay charity clause in his contract, or when, uh, one wins a landmark decision in a court, or when someone creates something beautiful, that's, uh-- that's why I'm here. You're-- you're one of those special people. You sure you don't want some vodka, now? I'm sure. Now-- you, uh-- you could, uh, settle down with Dick Elston. You could decide to do that. I know that. I have. Oh, wait, wait. No, look-- wait. Always hear Marv Gilman out. I want you to know all the alternatives, Lee. You should never make any kind of a decision, ever, without having all the facts. Well, now, look. What I mean is you just won the world championship. I mean, you're champion of this whole wide world. Let me explain what I think that means. Skiing is a unique sport. You know, mass participation. Many, many products. All the ski equipment, plus, what? What, parkas, sweaters, cosmetics? On, and on, and on. Not to mention the prize money. You know, I don't ski just for money. I know that. But what do you live for, Lee? I mean, what do you really, really live for? You know? I think I do. Oh, I-- I don't think anyone can know at 22. Careful, Marv. You're losing your incredibly. I'm sorry. I wouldn't want to do that. I really wouldn't want to do that. I can get you the time you need to learn what your life is all about. [non-english speech] Yes. I'm alone. I want Ben on the hill tomorrow morning at 10:00. There's no reason. They think he'll testify. He won't. No, he won't. I'll make sure he won't. I want him in a bright parka that I can spot in t he crowd. Have you ever skied pay dirt? Vicki? Yes. I've skied it. I want him there tomorrow morning at 10:00. They'll find his body in the spring. Pierre, why don't you give me a little time to find out whether or not he's going to talk? Vicki, you know better than that. It's not up to me. The decision has been made. Cheer up. They'll find you another spot. [car horn] Gee, this is a really terrific place. I think we can get used to it. This is an occasion. The first fire in a new home. It seems I do everything first with you. Mhm. And last. Come here. You should have seen me. After I finished cleaning out that chimney, I'm telling you, that was really something. Why did you give up your other place? Oh, you know. I mean, a man can't spend the rest of his life living above a pancake house, huh? I sure like the home cooking. Mm. Besides, we had some good times there. Yeah, we did. Did you cut your your? Huh? Did ya? A lady in Stowe did it. Oh? Does all the elegant ladies from New York. - Ah. - You like it? Yeah. I love it. You missed an interesting party. Marv Gilman thinks there might be a job offer for me, from LHI. And he wants to be my agent. Is that all he wants? No. But I can take care of myself. Marv thinks with the world championship, I've got a chance to do something. I mean, he wants to line things up. I'd get to ski, travel-- make money, have fun, all at the same time. It's a heck of an opportunity. I think I'd like to give it a try. Would you like some more wine? Sure. Hey, I got a raise. Yeah? First of the month. 1,100. And I also signed up to teach mountain climbing during the summer. I'm really happy for you. Sounds terrific. What about us? Hm? You could move in here. There's plenty of room. Should we change the rules now? Who's changing the rules? I don't know. You know, I'm not very domestic. I mean, I-- I've never even tried to cook, or anything. That's a terrific reason not to move in. Maybe it's more than that. Something happened in Stowe. I felt like a celebrity. It's a new feeling. I liked it. It frightens me. Do you know what I'm talking about? Yeah. I know that I love you. And I want you to be with me. I'm just not ready yet. Then when? I don't know. So much is happening. It used to be so easy. Ski. See you. - Let's get you home. You've got a big day tomorrow. The people have been good to me here, but it's time to move on. Where? Oh-- some place big. And at sea level. Tell me, is a t-shirt dance contest any fun? If you like fertility rights. Good luck tomorrow. Thank you. [phone ringing] Hello? Hi, Lee. Just had dinner with Harwell, and he wants to sign you to a promotional contract. What do you say we get together and talk about it, uh, over a glass of champagne, maybe? Uh, not tonight. Not tonight, Marv. OK. I'll see you tomorrow. Lee? I'm really-- really very happy for you. Marv, you're sweet. Thanks. Bye bye. [music playing] Look, Wendy, I talked to your parents. You're underage, and they want you back in Detroit. They're lying. I'm 18. - OK. I've gotta see your birth certificate. It's in a safe deposit box at the bank. You want to take my word for it, or you want to lock me up till Monday morning? I want to see that birth certificate Monday morning. Got that? Sure, sheriff. Don't worry. I'll see ya. [knocking] Yeah? Oh, hey, Dick. Hi, I'm Marv Gilman. Yeah, I know who you are. What's with you and Lee? I'm a businessman. Yeah, well, I think your interest in her is more than just business. Yeah, well, I've got a deal memo from LHI. They want Lee to promote their products, and they're willing to pay her $100,000 to do it. And if she agrees to leave on a tour right away-- I don't want to hear the details. Ousted men like you annoy me. You take a young girl like Lee, you provide her with her first romantic experience, and you think you own them for the rest of their life. No, I don't own her. But you play games with her, I'll come see you again, OK? Yeah, is Don Harwell there, please? Thank you. Yeah, Don, hi. No, I just was taking it easy, you know? Uh, on the Lee Larson deal, I think there's something that LHI can do to make sure it happens. Skiing is like, uh-- it's like making love. Your mind is in your whole body, instead of just your head. If you know what I mean. I know. I've made love, too. Not with me. Life is full of little disappointments. In this case, it's a big disappointment. [laughter] - Oh, no. - Oh, I'm terribly sorry. Here, please. Mike? My name's Wendy. Uh, will you excuse me? Elsa! Uh-- uh-- uh, gee, I'm sorry. I had no-- is there something, maybe, that I could do for you? I mean-- Oh, Dick. How you doing, old buddy? Pretty good. Where's Lee? Oh, she's at home. Oh. Hey, Ron. Andrea. - Hello, Mike. - Hi. How's it going? - All right. You know Dick. He used to be on the circuit. Sure. Dick Elston. I'm Ron Corley. How you doing? Fine. Nice meeting you. Of course, Dick's retired now. I don't blame him. You know, the competition's tough out there, huh, kid? Mike, you know the, uh, jump competition tomorrow? Sure. What about it? I'm gonna win it. I just happen to have what you're looking for. You're kidding? Oh, you think of everything. Well, it's not your favorite, but it was the best I could do. Is it OK? Mhm. Sure, it's OK. You wanna talk about [inaudible]? Ah. You planned this whole thing? You thought the room was bugged? Yep. You're too much. Just enough. Well, the, uh, DA has offered us immunity, both, uh, John and me. And he wants everything we've ever fronted. The land deals, the horse and dog tracks, everything. And the names. Reno, Chicago, Miami. Ben, you testify, that's suicide. Pleased don't do this. Go to jail. I'll wait for you. You won't. And I can't. Don't you know by now that I love you? Darling, I'm 25 years older than you. So what? Nothing good ever happened to me before I met you. Ben, please don't do this. I will wait for you. I swear it. How's it going, Dick? Oh, just about finished, Mr. Larson. Thanks for letting me use your shop. I appreciate it. I know you don't like anyone else tuning your skies. Well, you know, you want it done right, you gotta do it yourself. I know. lee feels the same way. I, uh, guess that kind of thinking won her the championship. Yeah. Yeah. All that work is finally paying off. Looks like the whole world is beginning to open up for her. Except, uh-- she'll never get out of here without your help. Meaning what? Meaning I know she loves you, but she'll never leave unless you let her. Well, nobody's holding her back. She's a big girl now. She's capable of making her own decisions. Besides, what's wrong with staying here? There's nothing wrong with here. But Lee's got a shot. What kind of a shot is it? I've been there. I traveled the circuit. It's not all it's cracked up to be. But you've done it. You've been there. At least you decided. Look, all I'm saying is let her decide, too. Hm? Think about it. ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Lee Larson. [music playing] [applause] ANNOUNCER: Isn't that beautiful? And that's only a warm up for today's competition from Ed Lincoln and Jonie Tori Lincoln. Woo! ANNOUNCER: In a free jump competition such as this, the skies are judged on height, form, and the landing, and the difficulty of their jumps, much like the diving competitions at the Olympics. Mike Sloane is coming into the jump now, the first of three on which he'll be judged. This will be a layout tuck double back somersault. Let's watch. Sensational. A nearly perfect jump, both in height and form. All eights and nines. A tremendous first score. Next man to go will be Pete Atkins out of Killington, Vermont. [applause] [applause] ANNOUNCER: Oh, boy. It's easy to see why these jumpers are all heavily insured. That's gonna take Jim Aberling out of the competition. But he looks OK. Dick Elston, who was a world class downhill racer before going freestyle, won this event three years ago, but hasn't competed since. Elston's also going to attempt a lay out tuck double back somersault. Beautiful execution. He certainly hasn't lost his flip. [applause] ANNOUNCER: A perfect score! That puts Elston in first place on his first jump. Look at that! One of his skis came off! What a recovery. [applause] [applause] ANNOUNCER: Sloane's coming in for his second jump now. This will be a full in, back out. A double back somersault with a full twist on the first flip. And he got it. Mike Sloane is certainly proving why he was a favorite here today. And now Tom Granadi out of Sun Valley, Idaho. [applause] ANNOUNCER: Elston is ready for his second jump. This will be a half in, half out, which means a half twist on each flip. [applause] ANNOUNCER: Beautiful form. And Sloane and Elston are still head to head as we go into the final jump. Sloane's preparing for his third and last jump. He's going to attempt the very rare and dangerous triple back somersault. Now, this is a trick he's trained for for some time, but has never done in competition. Unbelievable! A perfect score for Sloane! And believe me, Elston's going to have to do quite a jump now to beat him. And that's exactly what he's going to try to do. He's moving into the jump. He's going to attempt a trick that's never been done before. It's a double back lay out somersault with a full twist on each flip. This is a first. Let's have a look. He made it! He just made it! Isn't that incredible? [applause] Yeah! Not bad. That was terrific! Oh, all the way, you are just beautiful. ANNOUNCER: So it was that little mishap at the end that cost Dick Elston this competition. But Mike Sloane is the winner, and he's a fine, fine athlete. We want to see some mens' parkas. I've got plenty of those. Anything special in mind? Oh, I don't know. - Something sporty. - Oh? Size 42? - 44. - Four, huh? Here's-- yeah, we just got this in. A little flashy, isn't it? I like it. OK. I'll try it on. Excuse me a moment, will ya? Morning. - Good morning. - Can I help ya? Oh, I'm just going to browse on the new skis, if it's OK with you. Help yourself. Thank you. How do you like it? Well, I, uh-- still think it's a little colorful. It looks good on you, Ben. Take it. OK. OK, I'll take it. Can't argue with the lady. I may not be a gourmet, but I've sampled hot chocolate in every ski resort I've been to. Aspen, you know that little, uh, shop that's by the park? Well, it comes close, but Silver City-- Well, maybe it's the company. It could be. You know something? I surprised myself this morning. I really liked being in front of a crowd again. I know why you jumped. You wanted to prove that you got out of the competition because you wanted to, not because you weren't good enough. You know, when I saw you, I realized that I wasn't giving you the same choice. I haven't made my mind up yet. What are you doing tonight? Seeing you. [music playing] [applause] [clattering] [applause] I'm going home for a t-shirt. You can't. I need you up there. Lucy can handle it. Wendy, you let me down now, and you're fired. For what? Question. Mhm? When the forest service built this place, do you think they knew what it would mean to the youth of Silver City? Yeah. Come on in. [music playing] [applause] All right. Enough with the fertility rights. Let's go. [applause] [applause] [music playing] Ben? Where were you? I was worried. There's nothing to worry about. How do you get into trouble around here? Not so hard to freeze to death, though. How about a scotch? Right. Uh, no ice. All right. I, uh, took a little walk. Did some thinking. I made a decision about the grand jury. Thanks. What decision? I'm going to testify. Oh, Ben, no. Let's drink to it now, and I'll try to tell you why. You'll get yourself killed. There are things I'm more afraid of than that. Like, uh-- dying without ever having made a statement of who Ben Forbes is. I've been somebody else's man all my life. You're a good man, Ben. I'm a front. Empty. Fronting the rackets, fronting other people. That's the kind of a good man I am. And, you know, not once did I ever ask myself why I was doing it. And whether it was right or wrong. And I'm not talking about morality, I'm talking about myself. Was I alive? What if I were to die in prison for somebody else? - That's your son talking. - No. No, no. No, it's me. It's really me. What about us? I love you. And I want you. But after I testify, I'm gonna have to disappear. I can't ask you-- You can ask me anything right now. Not Monday. Not after you testify. It has to be now, Ben. We could go away tonight. I'll go anywhere with you. I will. I do love you, I swear. But I don't want us to be frightened all the time. Worrying about a contract catching up with us. I want us to be able to love each other. Ben, if we go away now, they won't care. They won't come after us. Oh-- Ben, please. We'll talk about it after Monday. Let's just have fun together tomorrow, and not think of anything, eh? Sure, Ben. OK. [music playing] Woo! Woo, woo, woo! SINGER: I need love! I need love! I need love! I need love, I need love, I need love! I need love! [applause] SINGER: Don't leave me this way. I can't survive. I can't stay alive without your love. Oh, baby. Don't leave me this way. I can't exist. I shouldn't miss your tender kiss. Don't leave me this way. [applause] [applause] [applause] All right, we've got a winner! We got a winner. All right, let me have your attention. We got a winner. The t-shirt dance queen of the Rocky Mountains is miss Wendy Brandt. [applause] [music playing] Superstar. Hey, do I get a prize? What do you want? How about you, for a couple days? You happy? Yes. I love you. I love you. And I think it'll keep. You know that? Good morning, reverend. Good morning. I really enjoyed your sermon. Well, thank you very much. Well, you know, it's not often that you walk into a strange church and really feel at home. Well, that makes me feel very good. How are you enjoying the skiing? Oh, well, you know, I'm not much of a skier. I just came up for the weekend, enjoying the scenery. It's marvelous, isn't it? It truly is. Well, have a good time. Bye. Thank you very much. So long, reverend. Morning. Good morning. How are you, Lee? Fine. I saw your freestyle exhibition yesterday. It was beautiful. Thank you, reverend. Bye. Keep up the good work. [boom] Andrea? ANDREA: Yeah? Come on back. I gotta go to work. Come on. No. Give you a present. Uh-huh. No. I have to leave tonight. I know. You haven't asked me for a job yet. And I'm not going to. Why not? You guess. But I would like to maybe come to New York and see you. Yeah, I'd like that, too. But I've got a very jealous wife in New York. Oh. I see. I, uh, need a cup of coffee, or something. Well, tell me, what are you going to do today? I don't know. Wait for you. You OK? Yeah. I'm OK. I'll see you later, OK? Just give me a good listen, all right? Sure. Go ahead. OK. You get to be accompany liaison to ski patrols all across the country. You get them to use our equipment, they get it for free, you get $30,000 a year, and we at LHI get the good PR. Plus, and I think you're going to be interested in this, Dick, you get your own time schedule. Which would mean you'd be able to visit Miss Larson from time to time, anywhere you want, on my money. Well, that's an interesting offer, but it isn't necessary. Lee's already decided to sign your contract. Hey, terrific. Marv Gilman put you up to this? Everybody has her own price. Marv Gilman happens to be at the top of his field because he usually finds it. Listen, I saw you jump yesterday. I know your rep around here. The offer still stands. Well, thank you, Mr. Harwell. You're a gentleman. Just remember this-- you didn't buy Lee with money. What she wants is a chance to establish her own identity. I'll see you later. Now, the trouble is I got to like the dude. Andrea, why is that trouble? The usual catastrophe. He's married. Are you sure? He told me this morning. Sounds like the old captain's paradise syndrome. A wife in New York, a girl at every sports scene. Well, that'll make it easier when I start to miss him, huh? Sorry. Hey, I'm sorry to lay this on ya. Look, you go on. I'll talk to you later, OK? I'll call you. Thank you. Ready? Yep. You know, I hate groupies, and I don't want you to think I'm one. What makes you say that? The way I came on to you. I was running out of time because they're sending me home to my parents tomorrow, because I'm underage. Under age? How old are you? 17. 17? You said you were 19. That was last night. Oh, boy. Well, when should I expect your father? Hey, no, don't worry about it. My folks aren't bad people. They just don't want to see me grow up. You know what? You're going to grow up, and they're going to accept it. And the less you fight it, the faster it'll happen. What do you say we hit the hill? OK. Two. Two, please. Lee? Could you plase sign my program? Sure. Here. Are those skis better than last year? No. Just more expensive. But I get mine for free, so you keep your own. OK. - Thanks a bunch. - Thanks a lot. Bye bye. See ya. It's too cold for me to get this. Hey, everybody. How you doing? Say hello to Wendy Brandt. This is Lee Larson. Hi. Marv Gilman. How are you, Wendy? Of course, that's Ron Corley. Hi. Of course it is. See ya later. - Bye bye. Bye. Hey, caught the tape of your show. Thanks for the kind words. Your jumps were great. Lee? The network's interested in talking with you about a Lee Larson special. Well, why don't you talk with her now? Lee, why don't you ride up with Ron here, and I'll catch you in the next car. Well, are you sure? No, sure, I'll see you on top. It's ready. Thank you. Thank you. Where are you folks gonna ski? Well, I dunno about the champ here, but me, the easiest one I can find. What about you? Oh, I don't know. Maybe pay dirt? Right. You don't mind a little music, do you? Elston to gondola control. Go ahead. Listen, we just had a gust up here, it must have been around 40 miles an hour. What are you reading down there on the lift line? OK here. Well, you'd better get a weather update. Mike's the one you should sign. Oh, but he only handles very special people. My door's always open. See what I mean? Mike, Dick Elston's still very good, isn't he? Yeah. He is. You could have done anything on skis. Why freestyle? Why not downhill, or slalom? I didn't want to race against a clock. I wanted something inventive. Something I could express myself with. Besides, it's a beautiful feeling. How would you feel about skiing an 18,000 foot mountains with the Shah of Iran? Or maybe a musical hour ballet in St. Moritz? That's the kind of show the network's interested in doing. You OK? Not really. Well, don't worry. It'll work out. How? I'm supposed to go home tomorrow. Elston to gondola control. Control room. We just had a-- oh, about a 60 mile an hour gust up top. Still no problem on the line. I want to close down the gondola and all exposed chairs, except for 12 and 14 over in the wood. Everything else stops. You're gonna have a lot of unhappy skiers around here. That's tough. Put everything on slow until the lifts are clear. OK. Fine. We seem to be slowing down. What's the matter? What's going on? It could be anything. Probably windy up top. What is it? I don't know. [screaming] [alarm ringing] What's happened? Easy. Easy. [alarm ringing] [screaming] Mike! [alarm ringing] Ben, are you all right? It's my hip. We must have been hit by a [inaudible]. [gasping] We're gonna fall, Ben. We're gonna fall. Easy, honey. It's gonna be all right. It's gonna be all right, you understand? You're hurt. Just-- sit very still. We gotta get out of here. Why? If we get knocked any harder into that tower, we could end up just like that car up there. And I don't know how long that car can hold on by one pin. Mike, Mike, Mike. Mike, wait. Shouldn't we-- shouldn't we wait for help in here? I don't think we can take that chance. Now, there's a ladder on the high side of that tower. Now, I think we're a lot safer out there than we are in here. No, Mike, I'm afraid. So am I. I'll go first, then you, then you, Marv. Wendy? It's OK. Hang on. Both hands. Marv? Marv? Come on. Hang on. Come on, Marv, or we'll leave you here. Let me stay in here, Mike. I'll stay in here. Come on. Marv? Come on. Come on! I got you. Hold me tight, Mike. I got you. Don't worry. I got a good hold on. Just-- come on. I got ya. Grab hold of that-- there you go. That's it. I got you. Now take your left foot, and put it right here on this-- girder. Take it easy. - Hold me. - I got ya. No worries. Duck under there. Gone but the 22, huh? This is Dick Elston here. We've got a major emergency above tower three. Get Stretch, and tell him to bring the evacuation equipment to tower four right away. There are to be no attempts at evacuation-- I repeat, no attempts at evacuation unless I authorize them. You take care of the people up there, I'll get them on the gondola. All right. How will they get to us? They have all sorts of contingency plans for emergencies. Grab hold. Mike! Mike! Mike! [screaming] [groaning] Are you all right? I think so. Move over this way, here. Just point your foot. Move it over. You got it. You're just on a ladder. Easy. OK, slow. Slow. That's it. One at a time. Hey! Hey, get us outta here! They don't let us out of here, I'm gonna jump. Is that a promise? What's going on? We've got a gondola about ready to drop down there. OK, set up a cordon. Only doctors and controllers get through, OK? You got it. Easy, get over here. One at a time. [engines revving] [tapping] How you doing? No place to run, is there? Well, the next time you go to Samoa. Deal? That's a deal. [inaudible]. You know, I kinda liked that lady. Can you make it down? Yeah, I think so. It's just my right shoulder. I'll put a safety strap around you, here. I'm a doctor. What's the quickest way to get there? Take that trail down there, and bear left. [siren] Everybody all right in there? No! There's a man hurt! OK, well just stay calm. Come around here. I gotcha. Just take it easy. Easy. I'm gonna cast you a rope. Got that? - Got it. OK, bring it back up the other side. Out the other window, there. Let me have it. Let's do it again. Once more. All right. Here's the other-- Look. What is it? OK, come on over here. - It's my shoulder. - This way. Easy. Easy. Sit down here. All right. Get him back here. [inaudible] I'm gonna pass you a rope. I want you to take this end, and I'm gonna tie off the other. And throw it down, and we'll bring up the harness. I'm a doctor. What's the problem? He may have a broken collarbone. Let's have a look. Oh, perfect. I got a jump competition next week. Just perfect. We'd better keep it immobilized till we get down there. All right. OK. Go! All right. All right, here it comes! Hey, Marv? That door'll still be open this time next year? It'll be open. Mike? Thanks. Ah-- Wendy? Yeah? What's it like in Detroit this time of year? Why don't you come and find out? Sounds like a good idea. You know, he's a nice guy. I never figured on him being such a nice guy. Thanks. There's three people up there. There's a man hurt. Get that doctor up here! OK, Lee, hon. You're next. OK, you're fine. Easy. That's it. Come on, take it easy. You all right? I'm gonna send you two down on a skidoo. Well, can we wait until they get down? Better for us if we clear the area. How are you doing? Not too good. You're next. Now, just relax when you get in it. You'll be fine. [groaning] Ben. What? No-- no, nothing. Look-- look, don't worry about it. I'll be OK. Ben, no! God help me, I've gotta tell you. What? You see, they just wanted your watch. It wasn't supposed to go this far. What are you talking about? There's a man. He's waiting down there, to kill you. You? Oh, Ben. Ben. [crying] Oh, Ben, wait! I'll take my chances. No! Let's go. Ben? OK, let's go! OK. Oh, gosh. You OK? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Huh? Yeah. Oh, good. I'm a doctor, miss. Can I be of any help? Yeah, we're going to need all the help we can get when we start clearing the whole line. Ben? Are you all right? I'll live. Now, let's get him down below. I'd like to get some x-rays. Ski patrol? No! Stop that man! He's a killer! Do something! Ben! Ski patrol! Ski patrol! They want you at the first aid hut right away. I'll take him down for you. Do you know the way down? Yes, I do. Here. RADIO: 710, 28. 710, 28. Please, just-- Ben, if we-- if we had just left last night, we would have been OK, huh? I'm so sorry. I just didn't know how to tell you. You're coming with me tonight. I want to introduce you to some friends of mine at the network. What about your jealous wife? I'm not married. [horn blowing] I'm still not sure about all this. Aw, just relax. You'll have a good time. You really think so? Yeah. Here you go. Thanks. Thank you. Just how old is the Shah of Iran, anyway? 29. [laughter] Oh, I'll miss you. I'll miss you. But Jackson Hole is only five weeks and two days away. Mm. See you there. Yeah, maybe. For sure. For sure. I love you. MAN: All aboard! [music playing]
