And they lived happily... - Ever after! - Ever after! Shema Israel? Shema Israel, Hashem Eloheinu, Hashem Echad. - Amen. - Amen. Love you. Love you, too. Goodnight. - Father... - Mh-hm? Why do they hate us? I don't think they hate us. Hitler is just blaming us for the suffering of the working class and some people choose to believe him. But why? It's not a simple answer... ...but I can tell you this.. The economy is getting better. And soon they will stop focusing on who to blame for what didn't work, and everyone will set their eyes on building a better future. We just have to keep contributing our part to Germany, like we have always done. Go to sleep now. You have school tomorrow, and you are too young to worry about these things, hm. - Love you. - I love you, too. Ten-hut! General Patton. Good evening, soldiers! Good evening, sir! At ease! If we take the generally accepted definition of bravery as a quality which knows no fear I have never seen a brave man. All men are frightened. Courage is no more than fear holding on a minute longer. Now imagine fighting this war as a civilian. Imagine not knowing how to shoot a gun and challenging the Nazis to save lives. I've just heard an incredible story. I'd like to share it with you. Because it's a story about one of those unique human beings that makes your sacrifices and your heroism completely worth it. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Father! What a surprise to see you! How dare you? Did you like my show? You are a clown dressed like Hitler in a whorehouse.. Papa, it's not Hitler, it's Chaplin and it's a cabaret.. Oh, I apologize for my confusion. Father, I'm an actor. - Yeah. - Yeah. We have to start early tomorrow. Let's go home. Go. Mrs. Garber is coming. Mrs. Garber is coming. - Hello, Mrs. Garber. - Hello. - How is Emma? - She's good, thank you. How come you always ask about her? Actually, my father wants me to marry her. - Really? - Really. Is that true, Charles? Is she Jewish? - I think so. - Then, no. Why? I wouldn't wish on any Jewish girl the infinite disgrace of dealing for life with this useless bum who wants to be a clown and has the muscles of a ghost. Well, most of that is true. Emma is the only Jewish woman in the world who doesn't want to marry. You shouldn't waste your time. Thank you. - I don't think that worked. - No, I think it did. - She now thinks you are a bum. - No, no. Psychological projection, according to Dr. Freud. - Never heard of him. - I know. Uh.. Blaming others can lead to a "kick the dog" effect where individuals in a hierarchy blame their immediate subordinate and this propagates down the chain until the lowest rung. What does that even mean? It means if the butcher thinks you are a bum you are probably a genius. - Mh-hm! - Yes. - Ah! - Tell Dr. Freud to cure that! - Good evening, uncle. - Shalom, Georges. Do you mind if I talk to Marcel for a second? I've told you a million times, I'm a serious actor, okay? I'm not a clown. I just need your help. These kids went through a lot. What do I care what they went through? - Don't say that. - I'm saying it. I'm saying. I'm sorry, I don't care, okay? I'm not good with children. You know, I have no patience. Sorry. You know, I barely have time to work with my father he now wants me there all day. I have an entire play I'm working on where I interpret 30 different characters. - Thirty! - Marcel! - What? - These are Jewish orphans. I know that. I know that. You know, I.. sorry, I.. I definitely have an alive Jewish father. That hasn't made my life any easier. That's a horrible thing to say. - How do you want me to help? - Go work on your play. - Ah.. - You have many characters to write. - Georges! - Go away. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hi, Flore. I just saw your mother. She was telling my father that I should marry you, hm. Strange. That generation, I guess, they're old, you know. They don't understand that, of course, we would only get married for love. And you couldn't find love at the cabaret, could you? Hey, don't believe everything you hear about that place. - Okay? - I'm sure it's very reputable. Well, art can happen anywhere. Okay, look at, uh, look at Marcel Duchamp. I don't know who that is. Yes, well, you should before you judge an artist by his canvas. And your canvas is the cabaret? Yes. No. No, what? Who are you again? - The girl you want to marry. - Excuse me, no, no. I don't want to marry you. Your mother wants you to marry me and I was just being polite to her. There they are! - How many did you say? - 123 children. The foundation paid a fortune for their lives. Their parents were just killed by Nazis. Marcel.. You want to look? - Are you ready? - I am. Why is my brother here? I thought he may clown for the kids. He only cares about himself. And God forbid you call him clown, he'll get all crazy. Look, if he doesn't help, we'll send him home but at this point we need everyone. Alright. That bus is not enough. It's all we've got. I can get our father's truck. That's a good idea. Make sure there's no knives or meat in there. The children are afraid. Go. Alright. Come on. Let's go. What's wrong? Let's go. Hmm. Let's go. Do you wanna come down? This way. Careful. It's okay. Easy! Don't be this way. Oh, oh. Calm down. Everybody, calm down. Calm down. Calm down. There is food for everyone. There's no need to fight. Sit down at the table. No, no need.. - I'll give you this.. - No pushing. Georges. Georges, please help me. Try this one. - Is it too big? - No, it's fine. It's alright. You are becoming a big girl. Come with me. Mila, I'll be right back. Am I going to be okay? You are okay. This happens to every woman. It happens to me. It just means you are growing. So, from now on, once a month for a few days you are going to have to wear one of these. What's that? It's a special napkin that makes sure the blood doesn't reach your clothes. It's only going to last for a few days. It's like, um, a rehearsal to prepare for the day many years from now, when you are ready to have a baby. No. No running. No, no. There is no need to run. You're gonna hurt yourself. Calm down everyone. Please, no standing on the table. Be nice to each other. You're family now. This is your new home. What's he doing? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Blow! Blow. Go. You dress like a clown, you paint a clown. What can I do for you? You rub the brush on paint, you draw a face. I'm not going to say it's ugly, I think you are getting better. I just never quiet understood why does anyone do it even when it's great. Tell me. Why do you do it? Why do you go to the bathroom? Oh, you need not to offend your father. No, no. No, I'm not offending you. I'm, I'm asking. Why do you go to the bathroom? Because my body gives me no choice. There it is. That's my answer to your question. - Amen. - Amen. Amen. Ah, steak. How original. Wh... where did you get this? Thanks. Where did you get that suit? Actually, it's not a suit. This is a feminine undergarment. - I took it from mother. - Charles.. Alain thinks Hitler is going to invade Poland and the war is gonna spill all over France. Hitler has zero chance against France. He's bluffing. I almost wish he makes that blunder so we destroy him. - Have you heard him talk? - Ah! Talk, talk, talk, talk. Populist talk so that idiots can rage with euphoria and feel better about their miserable lives. I think Alain has a point and we should be ready in case we have to leave. I left Poland to escape anti-Semitism and now you're telling me to prepare to leave again? No. No. Yeah, me too. I... I can't just leave. Because of the children? Wow. The children? I'm helping the children as much as I can but I'm working on my play, okay? I'm upstairs painting the backdrops myself. - Thank you very much. - Yeah, I'm stupid. For a second I thought you had started caring about someone other than yourself. So.. Why would the children be my responsibility? Maybe because they are the only ones who don't consider your art completely ridiculous. There are 123 children in that castle. Please, tell me, where... where are we supposed to take them? Do whatever you want. You keep calling Marcel selfish. Yeah. But last I heard he's there helping children every day while you are theorizing about Hitler. How long has it been? About a year since they got here. Hello, Alain. Come on. Let's go. - Marcel! - Oh, no. Incoming. Incoming. Ah! Oh, oh, please, help me. Please, help me. Oh, okay. Whoa! W... whoa! Okay, thank you very much. I hope you're happy now. - Marcel? - Yes? - Can I tell you a secret? - Yes. Quickly. Emma likes you. Okay. Yes. Oh, hello. - So, you like her, too? - Oh, oh, yes. I... it's a great book. We are talking about something else. Entirely different. I like every princess in this castle. Okay? Maybe next time you want say it a little louder. - I will. - Broadcast it over the radio please. - Bye, Marcel! - Goodbye. - Ah, Georges. Hello, Flore. - Hello, Marcel. Alain! Hey! Georges! - Good to see you! - Hello, Alain. Good to see you! Tell me, what do you know? No more than what's on the radio. But we must prepare everyone to move south. The children are finally settled. It would be irresponsible not to start looking for alternatives. What alternatives? You've got another castle? Uh, no, no. Alain believes having them all in one place is dangerous in itself. Right? I'm not sure I follow. Hitler's rise is empowering the worst possible groups. Everybody knows Jewish children are living here. You don't want this place to become a target. I'm not going to bring them more instability just because you suddenly feel it may get dangerous. You are a mile away from Nazi Germany where an extremely popular leader is preparing the most powerful army in the history of Europe to conquer a neighboring country while he blames all possible evil on the Jews. Can I have one apple? Sure. - Be gentle. - Yeah. I think all he is saying is we should prepare for the worst. And he's right. There is no other option. I also think I should get started with their training. Training for what? They are children. We need to train them to survive. - Nazis! Nazis! - Nazis! Nazis! Hurry, Joseph! Juden? Juden? You maybe? Juden on the trees. - Don't do that! - Come down, Joseph! - Ah! - Yes. Listen. Your life and that of all your friends will depend on your silence. We're not playing here. But Marcel is still funny, Nazis are not. You see? Okay, everyone, come down. Now, have you seen a squirrel hide? A squirrel? The squirrel does not find a place to hide in the tree. No, the squirrel finds a place to hide where she can become a part of the tree. Now, the trick i... is not to make sure that they don't see you but that even if they do see you what they see does not catch their attention. Make the invisible visible and the visible, invisible. Marcel? - Can't see him. - Where is he? Where's he gone? Marcel? - Marcel? - Where'd he go? Get in. Get in. Come on. Yes, come in. It's cold, it's freezing. Come in. As a result of the German invasion of Poland.. ...the French Government has ordered all citizens to evacuate all border towns in the next ten days. We need to tell the kids we are leaving. I'll be sending telegrams to the Jewish communities to ask families to receive. Families can take some, but there's too many. What do you suggest? We're gonna need the church to receive some of the children. The religious kids are always talking about how mad their parents will be if they find out they broke kosher laws and you want to send them to a church? The Jewish law can be broken in life threatening situations. Maybe it's time to be honest with them. I don't know how we're supposed to tell them that this is over. Are you not going to say anything? Thank you. Next week is Rosh Hashana. A very special one.. Alright. I know. It's okay. ...because we welcome not only a new year.. There we go. ...but a new century. We are going to receive the year 5700. In every generation they rise up against us. Sometimes, a powerful man sometimes, an army or a nation tries to destroy the Jewish people. But here we are, together knowing that this time too, the Holy One, blessed be He will rescue us from their hands. We're going to continue taking care of you. But for a while, we won't be staying all together. And because of that we decided to blow the shofar now one week before Rosh Hashana so that you have this moment and that sound to remind you that you are not alone. Alright, everyone. Let's go to the South! We already placed forty with Jewish families twelve with Gentiles, sixteen in catholic schools and thirty in the orphanage of Izieu.. That's a hundred out, twenty more to go. I wish, but we're expecting dozens of new orphans to arrive from Germany. - You ready? - Yes, I am. - What are you doing? - Hi. There's a group in Lyon arming themselves to fight back. I know some of those guys. De Gaulle is helping them from Britain with money and weapons. It's a well-organized force. If you want to join them.. Oh, no, I, I don't fight, okay? I think, therefore I am. We've been thinking for 5000 years. Maybe it's time to try something else. Do you really think I could help anyone with a gun? Of course not. Okay. Look at this, Emma. Marcel Marceau. - It's perfect. - Let me see. It's a great name. - Heil Hitler! - Heil Hitler! You're gonna visit me, right? You know, if you don't visit me, I'll forget about you. Thank you. Come, come, come, come. Let's go. Goodnight. What? - Why are we kissing? Okay. - Shut up! Passports, please. Yes, yes. Of course. Please don't tell my father about this. He knows nothing. Who's your father? What are you laughing at? Please don't tell him. My father will kill me. No, the officer won't say a word or he will be killed by your father. I'm sorry. Please don't. Okay. Miss Garneau, I'm not interested in your father. Whatever your naughty business is with this man who is clearly not of your class.. But I want this to be the last time I find you in the mist of indecent activity or I will have to bring you to your father myself. Thank you, officer. Go home. Elise Leroy. - Everything okay? - Yes, yes. The priest seems like a good person, right? Elsbeth is strong. Yes, yes. - Okay. Listen. - Yeah. The, uh, the Resistance group in Lyon. - What? - How could we join them? Who? What do you mean who? Me. Us. - You? - Yes. Me. What happened? We just got stopped by these Vichy officers you know, and... I, I just.. I don't want to keep, like, running, you know without doing something about it. Listen... these Lyon fighters, they're serious tough folks, risking their lives for France. They get approached by infiltrators on a regular basis and if I make contact, there's no turning back. - I know. - If you're just mad because you got stopped. No, I'm not just mad. No, I'm... I'm ready to fight. Georges is expecting more children. Yeah, well, Georges will take care of them. He is a saint. I will talk to him. I thought you'd be, you know, proud of me. - I'm proud of you. - Okay. Maybe you could say.. - I'm proud of you. - Okay. Thank you. But first you must talk to our father. To tell him it's your decision. Okay, I will go tell him. You know where he is? - In the apartment. - No. Marcel? What in the world did I just see? You were in there? I saw you from upstairs. Did you like it? You can sing. That's what I always wanted to do but my father was a butcher, his father was a butcher. I couldn't just become a singer. And now you can. Yes. Because now I have nothing. They took everything but my voice. So, so wh... why did you fight my passion? Because I didn't want you to starve. Because most artists cannot make a living, you know? At least a butcher will never be hungry. That was, that was a great performance. - So, you liked it? - I did like it. I... I.. - Yes? - I would relax on stage more. - That's it. I'd just.. - Ah, so, you didn't like it? Excuse.. Uh, I did like it. I'm saying, I think you could enjoy it more and then, you know, we would feel it. Okay, I tell you something. Maybe, when the, when the war is over.. Mm. ...we, we could.. ...we can perform together. Alain and I are joining the Resistance. May Hashem protect you both. No, no, no. Don't stop. Don't stop. Let's go! Let's go! There is Marcel. Marcel! There is Emma! There is Emma! Get in. Get in. Get in. Go, go, go, go. Oh, my God. Welcome to the Resistance. Sit down. Who is Marcel? Me. Your passports are impressive. Thank you, sir.. Madam. Sir is fine, if it helps you. We're about to receive 20 fighters from Britain. - How long would they take you? - Twenty? Well, you may think it's some kind of, like, a mechanical process, okay? But it actually takes real art to study the curves and the movement of excuse me, of each letter. The strength with which it was written because it wasn't the same person who did each passport. And the combination of colors that gives you a black that looks authentic, because believe it or not black has different tones, okay? And it varies from city to city... How long? Twenty would take me a day. They're landing in an hour. An hour? We've been here for an hour. You could have told me. Most of Europe is crying in surrender while the city of Lyon has the only Resistance that is truly hurting the Nazis. You can sit there or you can tell me what you need to get them done in an hour. Give us 20 French passports. Let Marcel choose the names. He'll get it done. We're leaving in 20 minutes. Only Marcel comes with us. ♪ Ave ♪ Maria ♪ Gratia plena ♪ Maria ♪ Gratia plena ♪ Maria ♪ Gratia plena ♪ Ave ♪ Ave dominus ♪ Dominus tecum ♪ Benedicta tu in mulieribus ♪ Et benedictus ♪ Et benedictus ♪ Fructus ventris ♪ Ave ♪ Maria ♪ I've never met a Jewish painter. You don't have to pretend with me. Thank you, but there are plenty of Jewish painters. But it's not your people's forte when you compare it to writers, scientists, and you know why? Because your religion doesn't let you draw God. Which is also why so many people hate you. They get afraid when they can't see who you are praying to. No, they hate us because for centuries they've been told that we killed Christ. The entire epic of the Jewish people is that those who were slaves in Egypt liberated themselves to create their own society. No symbol is more dangerous for oppressors than Jews because Jews are emancipated slaves. Huh. I thought you were asleep. Well, you certainly weren't. What do you mean? What? I didn't even know you liked him. I don't tell you everything. Where is he now? He went to buy cigarettes. So, did you.. Tell me! I love him. So, you did it. What? Tell me! Nazis! Nazis! Nazis! Nazis! They're here. What is that? - Get the bags! - Okay. - Name. - Jason Baker. Let's go. Welcome to the Resistance. Stop. - Don't move! - Hands in the air! Put your hands in the air! No, no, no, no. No, no, don't shoot! It's my brother. Don't shoot! It's my brother. Alain. Alain? What happened? The Gestapo. They took everyone. Emma and Mila. Two Jewish sisters caught fighting with the French Resistance. This can end right now if you tell me where are the men. Mm. Mila, you stay here. Mila. Shh, shh. Right there. Don't move! Where are you taking her? Are you familiar with the word flaying? Also known colloquially as skinning. No? It is a method of a slow and painful execution in which the skin is removed from the body while the person is still alive. An attempt is made to keep the removed portion of skin intact and to keep the person conscious for the majority of the procedure. You are going to kill me anyway. What difference does it make? No, Emma. I've decided I'm not going to kill you. I'm going to do that to your sister... in front of you. Why? Because you don't want to tell me where the men are. If I can't capture them I at least want you to go back to them and tell them what you've endured. To see if they want to continue with their pointless Resistance. I don't know where they are. - I don't know! - Ugh. I swear. I don't believe that. Emma? What did you do to her? I didn't, I didn't even touch her. He wants to know where they are. Don't tell him. He will kill us all the same! So, you do know! - I don't. - You do know! - I don't! - You do know! - I don't. I don't! - Kill me. I don't care. We won't be traitors. We won't be collaborators. I respect that, you see.. We won't be collaborators. All these other people, no dignity. I would rather die like you than live like them. Don't say anything, please. Don't say anything. Don't say anything, Emma, please. I don't care what he does. I don't. - Please do not do that. - Please, Emma. - No, don't. Please - Emma, no. No, Emma, Emma. - No. Please. Don't! - Please, Emma. Emma, please! - No! - Don't do that! Don't do that! No, don't! We have to go in. - We have to go in. - No, no. - Klaus Barbie. - Yeah. I see him. What you looking at? It's fine, it's fine. It's fine. - It's her. - Of course, it's her. Where's Mila? Nobody should bother you as long as you're wearing this. Where is she? She's going in the train station. Where the hell is Mila? I don't know. Emma will tell us. They'll catch us as soon as we approach her. Okay. Okay, listen to me. Okay, bring the guards towards you and run. - I'm going in. - It's too dangerous. So, let them kill me. Go. Be safe. What are you doing? We must train and grow with the Resistance. We need to find guns. We need to learn how to shoot. We need to learn explosives. They're not humans. No human would do that to another. While you were there.. ...I... I filled myself with hate and of course I did feel an urge for revenge but... the more I thought about it the only thing in my mind.. ...was why are we here.. ...fighting a war we can't win.. ...when we could be taking orphan children to another country before the Nazis get to them? We can't leave now. But what... what can we truly accomplish? We can fight back. We found homes for the children. Safe places. No place is safe for them as long as they're in a country that's occupied by Nazis and the little fighting that we can do... We can slow them down. We can make it impossible for them in France. What is it the Nazis want? What? They don't care about Klaus Barbie you know, or a bunch of Gestapo slaves that we may kill, if we are lucky... No, you are right. They care about killing us like they killed her. So, what's the best way to resist? It's not to kill them. They're ready to die! If you want to resist we have to make sure more Jews survive. How can you not want to go and murder him? Of course, I want to murder Barbie. I want Hitler to die as well, but we can't kill all the Nazis. - We can kill some. - Mm-hmm. Or you can save some lives. And maybe one day those Nazis will be captured.. ...while the kids we saved go on and... and form families. What about those who already died? What do you think they would want us to do? Risk our lives to take revenge on their killers or do it to help their orphans survive? We have to save the children. We will. Germany, Poland. All over Europe. We're gonna be receiving 50 to 100 orphans a month. Listen, we want to help you take them out of France. Take them where? Even the allies have reached their cap on refugees. What about Switzerland? You plan to take children across snow covered mountains? At least it's safe here. They are not safe. If they are captured in the Alps we'll not only have to carry the responsibility of a disgrace but we will also lose the credibility and the funding we need to take care of the rest of the children. They are not safe. Georges, listen.. ...let us take a small group.. ...to see if we can get across the border. Please. Shh, shh. Shh. Shh. - No, Marcel. What.. - Shh, shh. - Where have you been? - Shh, shh. Shh. Go on, kids. Do what Marcel and Emma and Alain say and I promise everything will be fine. Thank you. Thank you for saving our lives. - Thank you! - Go, go, go, go, go! Go, go. Let's go now. Out. Go out. Alright. Let's go. - Alright. - Come on, kids. Let's go. Come on. - There you go. Here. - Goodbye. Go, son. You and mother need to get out of Europe as well. Go! Go! I understand there's a meeting about visas for foreign Jews. No, I.. The least guarded place at the border is the end of this ridge. We're gonna go through this forest, which is supposed to be easier. That will take us to a path leading down the ridge down this mountain... to Geneva. And there's a... a trail down the ridge? Yes. Emma... you can tell me about Mila. I mean, I lost my father and my mother. People always feel sorry for those who die. They should feel worse for those who live. There... there are lots of beautiful things in life. If you could share it. Mila is no longer with us.. ...but we are here to make sure that you are all safe. Mila wouldn't want me to be sad. And I'm sure your parents would want you to be happy. We were never sad. Come here. I didn't know there was a stop in Lyon. It should be only a minute. He's here! Who is? Barbie. No. - I have to jump. - No, no, no. No. Okay, singing position. If he recognizes me, he's gonna kill them all! We cannot just leave you. Here! Oh, okay, go. Go, go, go. Come, come, come. Lock the door. Lock the door. Everyone, "Ave Maria." ♪ Ave ♪ Maria ♪ Gratia plena ♪ Maria ♪ Gratia plena ♪ Maria ♪ Gratia plena ♪ Ave ♪ Ave dominus ♪ Dominus tecum ♪ Where are you headed? We are going hiking in Jonage. Passports please. Yes. Mm, that is our young soprano, Joseph. - What are you doing? - Me? - You want them to laugh at us? - Oh, no. I would, I would never. They are children. I'm an educator. What good does it do to teach them fear? - Come with me. - Huh? I said come with me. Spread your legs! Show me your pockets. Show me your pockets. It's just a spoon and here's money. What's this? It's a mustache. You're making fun of the Fuhrer? No, no, uh, with all due respect, officer it's a, it's a Charlie Chaplin mustache. I think it's important to help the children laugh in the middle of this war. The girl.. How old is she? She, uh.. She is, uh, fourteen. You should help her nurture her voice. It's very special. - That's what we are here for. - Let me ask you something. Yes, sir. I have a daughter. How do you think I can help make sure she becomes interested in the arts? How old is she? She is just a baby. I'm not talking about what to do immediately. Hm. But as a strategy to build her personality for the future. Try not to impose it. The more that you impose it.. ...I think, the more she will rebel against it. Let her find her passion. Stay out of her way, you know, if anything push her in the opposite direction. Tell her arts are, are for the weak and she'll want to prove you wrong. That's very interesting. Very interesting. Thank you. Go. Now. Max! Thank you, sir. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Come here. Come here. It's okay. It's okay. Go slowly. Go slowly. Come here, Jerry. Come here. Okay, come here. Okay. Come on. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm sorry. - I'm fine. - Come here. It's okay. Thank you. Thank you. I'm sorry. Thank you. Let's take a break over there. Okay. Okay? Thank you. You are amazing. It's because of you. What does that mean? When we met, you were only interested in yourself. I'm still only interested in myself. Put it out. - Shhh. - Come on. Okay. Everybody to the trees! - Leave the bags. - Leave the bags. Leave the bags. Let's go. - Come! - Come on, let's move. Come on. Let's move. Go, go! Go, go. - Go! - No! - Are you okay? - Hurry! Come on. Come on, quick. Okay, let's go, up to the trees! Up! Hurry up. Up. Okay. Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Eyes on Marcel, eyes on Marcel. Don't look down. Halt! To the ridge! Let's go! Stop! Stop! Stop! - Is this the ridge? - I hope so. Everyone.. Jump! Go! Jump! Go! Jump! - Go! - Go! Jump! - I can't. I can't. - You have to. Jump! Emma! Emma! Jump! Jump! Emma.. Emma? Oh, oh, oh! Oh, careful. - Come here. - Bring her here. Are... are all the children here? - Yes. - Bring them up! They can see her. Emma! Where's Emma? - Over there! Over there! - Oh! Emma! - Sit here. - Emma! Emma! Emma! Emma! Emma! Emma! Do... do you hear me? It's Marcel. It's Marcel. Do you hear me? Emma, listen to me! It's okay. Are you okay? The kids are all here. It's okay. It's okay. Please, Emma. Please, talk to me. Do you hear me? Do you hear me? Emma? Emma, talk to me! Emma! Oh! Do you need help? Help? Wh.. Where... where are we? In the Alps. Yes... yes, but, but what... what country? You came all the way from France? Fra.. Switzerland? Yes, we are. We made it! We made it! Look at that! Let's go! Let's go! He risked his life many times by crossing the Alps to take orphans to safety. He is personally directly responsible for saving hundreds of children. And indirectly responsible for saving thousands. He's now one of our liaison officers. But he's also an actor and you are about to see his first official public performance. Soldiers, remember his name.. ...because he will never forget you.. Marcel Marceau!
