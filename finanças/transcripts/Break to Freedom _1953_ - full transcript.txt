You will be treated with respect to which your rank entitles you. Well, that'll be a change. Oh, you have a complaint? Yes I have. Why have I been kept outin that cooler for a month? That's a formality. It's against the convention. I'm a registered prisoner of was. Six weeks ago, I was interrogated then. Oh, it's over now. You will be comfortable here. In other camps, they always want to get away. Here, everybody is content. [suspenseful music] [shouting] [speaking german] What's the matter? The war over? You will [inaudible] Captain Maddox, a senior British officer here. [shouting] Well, that's that. Did they get out all right?Yes, sir. Just about. It was quite a fall. What about the gear?

[MUSIC - BING CROSBY, "DID YOUR MOTHER COME FROM IRELAND"] Must we have, "Does your mothercome from Ireland" again? What's wrong with "Does yourmother come from Ireland?"

Geoff, you better get your gear out of here. My name's Reed, Canadian Navy. What part of the states you from? Ah, from Texas. Wide open spaces, right? Yeah. That's right.

Captain Maddox, I'm sorry to inform you that your recent activitiesmake it necessary to impose certain restrictions. Such as? As from tomorrow, a curfewwill be imposed at 2100. Dogs will be loose in thecompound to see that prisoners remain in their huts. May I remind you gentleman thatreprisals for attempted escape are forbidden by the Geneva Convention? Ah, these are notreprisals, Captain Maddox. They are-- what shall we call them? Security measures. [knocking] [speaking german] [speaking german] Perhaps, uh, in a little while,we may relax restrictions if there are no more incidents. Captain, tell me something, whenyou were a prisoner in England during the last war, I supposeyou never tried to escape. Indeed, five times, I tried. Well-- Sorry, but-- It's all right. I understand. Good night. [singing] Who's he going to be when he grows up? He's called Albert. Looks like an Albert, don't you think? He stinks. Hello, sir. Carry on, please. Now, gentlemen, we're confined to barracks after 2100 hours of playingwith our buckets and spades. Mr. Shultz is doing. Blimey, this place will soon bea ruddy black hole of Calcutta at this rate. It's not exactly a Rose Garden now. Hey, how do you get in onthis tunneling racket anyway? You're in a mighty hurry, aren't you? Yeah, I am. I'm from Texas and I want out. Take it easy, kid. Take it easy. This place has its advantages, you know? Such as? You get time to think, time to potter, time to do what amuses youfor as long as it amuses you. What do you mean? You like it here? I didn't say that. I just don't believe inexercise for its own sake. That's all tunneling is for sure. All quick and clean through the wire either. The trouble with you is you're all too busy using your backs andmuscles to think your way out. While we've been digging,you've been thinking. That was big of you. [laughs] Maybe I have. Uh, knock off, will you? [humming] [knocking] Yes? [inaudible] sir? Come in then. I don't get that guy. He's all right. He doesn't seem to mind being here. He just takes it. He hasn't got any get up and go. Let's see how much you'vegot after four years. Well, I won't be around long enough to find out. And that's for sure, cousin. Well, I'll say goodbye, old boy, in case I don't see you in the morning. Well, it really is an excellent likeness. Thank you very much, Ainsworth. My wife would be delighted. Glad you like it, sir. Um, you have a fiance, haven't you, Ainsworth? Yes. Yes I have, sir. In a way, you know, it's harder on them at home that it is on us. It's so easy to let all this become the reality and not the dream. Yes, sir. Are they very depressed about naval? [inaudible] Well, let's try and thinkof something new now. I, um, I have an idea, sir. You have? It's only an idea. I'd like to have given it more thought, but now that [inaudible] You'd like to make it official? Ye, sir. Oh, splendid. Well, look, there's a concert inthe compound tomorrow morning. We'll have a meeting of theescape committee after that. I think we've had tunnel visionfor some time, at any rate. It isn't that, is it? No, sir. All through the wire. Oh. Well, keep it to yourself for the moment. You know there are times when I wish I could have a crack myself. They're a couple of fine boys, sir. Yes. Yes. I should like to have seen David again. Torpedoed. Is this yours, Hank? Yeah. I won it in a raffle. Still waiting for someoneto show me how to drive it. Would you mind? Go ahead. Give the understudies away, Jim will you? Yeah. That's Gerty, our hide-y hole. Everything's safe in Gerty. And the goons appreciate culture. [all groaning] Bring on the dogs, Schultzy-boy. Joe. Hey, Joe. Oh, Joe's conked out already. If you want to know, I wasthinking about the big maple tree in my garden. Mary says it's in bud again. We got one down in Texas. Every fall, the thing just dries up. Only tree for miles around. She got across to see it on leave. Climbed up and sat in it,she said, in uniform and all. She should have more sense. Fine thing for a man to havehis wife climbing trees. Young married women can doworse when they're on their own than climb trees. And better. I knew a married woman once who-- Oh, what the hell? [VOICEOVER] Oysters. Yes, yes a dozen oysters. Then a [inaudible]. Oh, no, no, I had that last night. [inaudible] and a steak. Yes, a thick, red, juicy, underdone steak. [VOICEOVER] [inaudible] had five. Across the compound. Under the trip wire two minutes. Get them to create adiversion on the other side. Through the first [inaudible]wire, oh, about five minutes. [VOICEOVER] She's young and pretty. And so many chaps were on edge around her. Good-looking chaps. If only I could see her, talk to her, tell her it's going to be all right. [VOICEOVER] Preserve a small harmony and help us to findpatience to bear with one another in our captivity. God bless all our loved ones at home. [inaudible] they may be in your loving care this night and always andthat we may be safely restored. [somber music] She won't drive, Henry [inaudible] Look, away you and help theold man with his garden. You know nothing about ships. You only got into the British Navy because we ran short of humans. I could have joined our own navy, you know. Your what? The Irish Navy. We have four corps vetsand they're lovely ships. Naturally, they're clyde built. Come on, Henry, the old man. What price a ticket to California now, uh? A fortress. No, a straggler. Probably been left behind. Yeah. Like us. Hey, what about this goingthrough the wire business? What about it? Well, when you go, will you take me? Look when you go throughthe wire, boy, you go alone. Come on. It's time to get in. You are the new man, aren't you? Yeah, that's right. Sir. Where I come from, we don'tcall any man sir, sir. Here you will obey regulations. Yeah, sir. That is not an ordinary watch. It's not a watch. It's a chronometer. Take it off. It is against regulations. Who says so? Do you hear? Take it off. Keep it on, Texas, unlessyou can recite the regulation it's against. I do not carry the regulations in my head. You can always put it inwriting to Captain Maddox. [MUSIC - ROSSINI, "OVERTURE TO WILLIAM TELL"] Come on. We're late. You don't have to be aroundthe bend, but it helps. Yeah. Oh yes, sir. Thank you. Window? Yes, sir. Door? Right. All right. Let's start. Petition of Lieutenant Aimsworth. Fire away, Aimsworth Well, sir, all our plans to date have only getting past the wire from the inside, under it, over it, and through it. Right. But there's one time each week when we're on the outside of the wire. Why don't we start from there? Uh? You mean the Thursday bath party? Yes, sir. Well, go ahead. It's really very simple, sir. Nine men go out of thisroom and eight come back. Quite. And there happens to bea count at the main gate. Out and in. That, sir, is where Albert comes in. Albert? And who is Albert? Sorry, I had forgot. You haven't met him officially yet. What the devil is this? So far he's on his best. He's only papier-mach in size. Bit anemic-looking, isn't he? I just have to paint him, of course. He's a little bit thin on top as well. I need volunteers forhair, eyelashes, eyebrows. Oh, that's you, Henry. [laughs] But what exactly does Albert do? He marches back in place of the chap who stays behind in the wash house. Marches back? You mean he's got a body? He will have. It's under control. Just a minute. If Albert marches back,he's also got to march out. Then where are you? You've got one too many to start with. No, sir. Albert doesn't march out at all. What's that? He goes out in bits distributed amongst us. After the showers, it's just a question of eight men dressing becoming nine. Oh brother. But Ainsworth, do you really think that Albert here would passmuster for a Naval officer in broad daylight? When i have finished him, yes, sir. But wait a minute. What about this fellow we'veleft in the bath house? What's he going to be doing? You know the [inaudible]latrine behind the showers. He nips in there and waits until we've marched off. As soon as the coast is clear, he's on his way. Well, what's the verdict? Joe? Well, sir anything is better than tunneling, the way I feel at the moment. Henry? I'll let you know when Albert's fooled me, sir. Jim? It's worth a try, sir. Well, Ainsworth, the ideais approved in principle, but final terms must be reserved until we've seen Albert in action. All right. Committee adjourned. I think you're flying a bithigh, you know, but good luck. [interposing voices] Well, holding out on us, eh? Why didn't you tell us? I hadn't quite worked out the details. How long is it going to take you to finish it? About a week. Making it's easy. It was the thinking that took the time. Ooh, that's for you. OK, OK. [inaudible] Texas, here I come. He ought to be all right when he's painted. [inaudible] [music - "my lily and my rose"] What key are we doing it in? Eight flat? Hey, wake up. What's the matter? What are you dreaming about? Just thinking about the last time I did this, for a female audience. Where was that? Uh, some of us gave a show fora lot of reds down at Plymouth. Plymouth? Yeah, Plymouth. How about those dames in Plymouth? Ooh. There was one little blonde, petty officer. Keep talking. I'm listening. I never thought flat shoes and a sailor hat could send me up the wall, but ooh, those Mediterranean blue eyes. i was even thinking of marrying the kid. It has its complications. Whoa, you haven't lived yet. Have you ever been to Grimsby? I had a dish there once that-- [inaudible] Come on. We've got a show to do. [clapping] [MUSIC - ELVIS PRESLEY, "FRANKIE AND JOHNNY"] [SINGING] Frankie and Johnny were lovers. Oh Lordy, how they could love. They swore to be true each other, just as true as the stars above. He was her man, but he's done her wrong. Frankie and Johnny went walking. Johnny had on a new suit. [inaudible] You know, Hank, old man, I'm more for Albert hitting the jackpot. I do think three haircuts inone week is taking it a bit far. You should worry I'm short of 24 eyebrows. [inaudible] Hey, Geoff. Yes? How will that do? Well, that's fine. Thanks, [inaudible]. Cut any more off, yourbrain would show through. Oh, go on and play with your cards. Hey, Geoff. Yep? Take a look at these. My kid did them. [inaudible] Think so? I think he's got something. [laughs] This one's supposed to be me. I love the ears. They look like rabbits. Is this a Picture of him? Yeah. He just turned four. He's a husky looking kid. Seems funny to have a kid you've never seen. I expect he'll be chuckingme around when I get home. [inaudible] Madison? Well, she sent me this. Had it taken specially. Very nice. See, she's wearing the ring. So she is. Say, Albert's coming on fine, isn't he? When's the great day? Pretty soon now. Does, um, Alison know what you look like? I've sent her sketches. i don't think it really matters to a woman what a man looks like. Just as well. You know, I can't work you two out at all. Writing away to each other. It must be four years now. Not bad for strangers. We stopped being that a long while ago. All through knitting a pairof socks for the Red Cross. It's going to be quite some day when you two meet for the first time ever. You know, there's one thingI'm most curious about. What's that? Her voice. Sometimes at night I hear it,especially when it's raining. It's deep, but at the same time soft. I wonder what it's really like. Maybe you'll soon know. Yeah. Are you going to marry her when you get back? Hmm? Alice? Yes. Yes, of course. [suspenseful music] And another cell right there. [inaudible] No where near it. [inaudible] How do you spell monotony? P-O-W. Who are we short of? [inaudible] He's checking up on Schultz. How are you getting on behind there you two? A couple of minutes, sir,and Albter will be with you. High time too. Do you honestly think it will work, sir? Well, it;s ingenious and daring. Too daring If you ask me. He's got to come out in fullview of the guards at pretty close range and I don't see anydummies standing up to there. Well, we'll have a chance to judge for ourselves in a minute. is your wife still stationedat Plymouth, Brennan? Yes, sir. She runs the canteen and HMS Jessup. That's the shore bassacross the town, isn't it? That's it. Did I tell you she'd been promoted? No. What's her rank now? Chief Petty Officer. Young for that, isn't she? 36. You ruddy kidnapper. It was her idea. Funny, I'd always meant to marry a brunette. Maybe you did. Me, I like them any color. Come on, roll. OK. Come on. What do we got? And a four. [interposing voices] That's it. Hello, seven. [interposing voices] We're safe from Shultz tonight. Herman says he's out of camp. Good. And what's more, I know why, sir. He's got a bit ofcrackling in the village. Even a snake has a love life, huh? All set, sir, when you're ready. OK, Craig. Yes, sir. All right. Go ahead, Ainsworth. Hang bugger. Stand by the curtains, will you? OK, fellas, come on. Let's see the big show. You know what they say down in Missouri? What? You got to show me. I got to see this. If we hadn't got the gramophone this week, we could have an overture. [inaudible] Ta-da. Well, what do you know? [clapping] It's large as life and twice as natural. Have a drag, Albert. Nice work, Geoff. After the war, you come to Hollywood. We've got just the job therefor you making the stars look like people. Let's have a closer view of him, Ainsworth. Put him in the chair there. Isn't that wonderful? It's really great. Sit down Albert. Make yourself at home. Here, Albert. Just make yourself comfortable. Well, sir, what do you think? Yes. Yes. I think he'd pass muster. What about you, Brennan? With a bit of luck, yes, sir. Henry? How on Earth did you make his legs work? Psychology. Huh? Did you see them moving? Well, no. Well, that's because they didn't. They just dangled. No one ever looks at feet in a crowd. Well, that's true enough. What about you Adam? I'm sold. I swear he winked at me. I'm quite proud of his eyes, made from the two halves of a ping pong ball. So that's where it went. Look out. Schooley is coming. What do we do? Get rid of him. No, stand fast, all of you. Yeah, that's an idea. Let's try him out. Hammock stations. OK. You over there. [inaudible] Mail up everybody. [inaudible] the book you're reading. It's called The Discontented Ass. One for Erickson. Thank you. Nothing new, Texas. Two for you, sire. Thank you. Six for lieutenant Reed. One for lieutenant Ainsworth. Excuse me. It's just one of his spells. He's often like this in the evenings. He's doing his yoga. Leave him alone. Oh. Oh, well-- I'll be getting along then. See you later, sir. Good night, [inaudible]. [all talking] Well, congratulations, Ainsworth. But you still haven't explained how you get him out to the bath house. Well, that's easy, sir [inaudible] [laughing] That's all there is to it, sir. Wow. We'll have a committee meetingin the morning and set a date. Good night. Good night, sir. Did you hear what he said? Passed with honors. Nice work, Geoff. Come on. Let's set him up again, huh? Sure enough. Hey, just look at those eyes. Got little red veins in them. Yeah. He's been hitting the bottle a bit I think. Eye strain. He's an accountant. He's been busy cooking the books all night. No, no, no, no. He's a songwriter, eyes full of soul. Liver, I think. I still say he's an intellectual. No, with hair like that,he's bound to be a violinist. What do you say, Geoff? Well if we'd all seen him thesame way, I'd be worrying, but now I know I've got it. Got what? The character I wanted, acomplete nonentity, Mr. Nobody, Mr. Everybody. There's no such person. Isn't there? the world is full of Alberts. [inaudible] be on the bus or tube and seen them, sitting in their rows all turned out in the same assembly line. Look at them. Clueless. Nothing moves unless you push it. Doesn't have to think, makedecisions, no confusion, no frustration, no worries. It's all worked out for him. He just falls into line. The final product of the modern world. There he sits, the truly free man. You call that free? Not where I come from. For my money, you might as well be dead. Don't worry. I was-- I was only thinking. Actually, I made him that way so the goons wouldn't remember his face. Well, here's to Albert, the most forgettable character I ever met. Don't be too hard on him, Geoff. After all, he's the guy who'sgoing to get you out of here. Yes. Well, have to started getting clothes, money, and papers together for you. Which route are you taking, Geoff? North or south? I don't know. Well, there's plenty of time for that, but you better stow him right away. He's been hanging around here long enough. You do it. It's good practice for you. What's with him? Eh, temperament. Am I butting in on anything? No, Jim. You'll be used to the idea by morning. What idea? That any moment now, you'llbe lamming out of here. What makes you think I'm going? It's why you made Albert, isn't it? Yes, I suppose so. Geoff, you do want to getout of here, don't you? I'll go when my turn comes. Sure, but you're first. It's an unwritten law. It's also an unwritten lawthat we share and share alike. I made Albert for the room. Yeah. I just tried telling them that in there. Sorry, chaps. I think it's a great idea,but I'd rather one of you tried it out, first. Now you're being ridiculous. Am I? You and most of the others havegot something to go back for, or someone. I haven't. I never had time to beanything or do anything much. You're an artist. What about your work? I can do that anywhere. Oh, don't give me that. Nothing worthwhile wasever born in a bag, Geoff. And that goes for art, too. Besides, there's-- there's Alison. That's different. We never had anything tomiss, so we don't miss it. Oh, no. That's not it. And you know it. You're afraid, Geoff. You've lived so long in a dream that you just can't face up to reality. Here, you've got a chance to get out and find out what she's really like, and you're shying away from it. No, I'm not, Jim. No? Then there's only one way of proving it. Get going and get out of here. That's life. Out there, Geoff. Don't crowd me, Jim. Give me time. [dog barking] OK, OK. Well, come on. Let's get out of here before the goons start using us for target practice. I've got everything on including my May West, and I'm still cold. Good old May. She saved my life at Anzio, but I didn't figure I'd have to sleep with her for the rest of my life. Just how many more times doyou have to crack that one? Just every night. Yeah. Yeah. I say, Geoff. Geoff. Hm? Don't forget to send themthe menu from [inaudible] with all you had ticked off. Oh, and the wine list, of course. I want the drool. Don't forget, they still got a war on back there. They still drink, don't they? I used to go to a little pop outside Plymouth up on the moor. I used to take Honey there. The wheat sheath? Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Afterwards, we used to walkout down through the heather. Man, her hair would shinelike gold in the moonlight. Oh, brother, look at that. Soulful Sigfried must be on tonight. Close the dunkle, somebody. Aw, let him look. Poor guy's sex starved,just like the rest of us. You're all so damn keen to get home. Why don't we do something about it? Listen to who's talking, the lucky guy. We've always shared alikein this room, haven't we? Shut up, Geoff. That's how I wanted to be with Albert. What, that? You mean to say you want us to draw for him? Why not? Give me the cards, Hank. Geoff, are you crazy? Albert's your idea, man. You've got to have first go of. There's a card for everyone. The highest wins. Don't do it, Geoff. You'll change your mind in the morning. That's the way he wants it, let him have it. Ace counts high. Take one. Where is yours? I hope this makes you very happy. Come on, fellas. Let's get on the merry-go-round. [chatter] Ready chaps? Close the dunkles, Geoff. [door knock] Yeah? Schoolie's here, sir. Hi, carry on. I must remind you that this is top secret and must not be discussedoutside this room. It is the BBC 9 o'clock news. Last night, the RAF carried out the heaviest raid yet made on Berlin. Over 2,300 tons of bombs were dropped. 26 of our aircraft failed to return. During the day, American heavy bombers, again, attacked objectivesin Western Germany. 56 German fighters were destroyed. For the fourth month in succession, the number of U-boats sunkexceeded that of merchant vessels lost by enemy action. Speaking at the Mansion House this afternoon, Mr. Churchill said that beforethe leaves of autumn fall, liberation will be at hand. Good night, chaps. Good night, Schoolie. Good night, Schoolie. If anybody's interested,I drew the ace of spades. [speaker announcement] [door knock] Come in. Ah, Erickson. You all set? That's right, sir. But before leaving, I'd liketo make one last request. Uh-huh. See this drawing Geoff made of me? Would you take care of it, please? And in case anything happens, make sure it reaches my next of kin? Well, certainly. I wrote her address down onthe back of her picture, here. Marlene Fraser. Next of kin? Well, you know, almost. Well, I hope you make it. Good luck. Thank you, sir. I always thought I'd be going out of here in a straight jacket. [chatter] Well, don't let Albert talk him out of it. Oh, don't you worry about that, sir. Come on, boys. It's time to go. Good luck boys. So long. I'll write you a letter. [chatter] This is the worst of it. [speaking german] Hereis a special announcement given out by the fearless headquarters in Berlin. In reprise of our Britishand American terror bombing of German women and children,large forces of the Luftwaffe attacked strategic targetsin Britain last night. The towns of Southampton,Plymouth, and Liverpool were left in smoldering ruins. Are those ruins still smoldering? Left turn, left [inaudible]. Forward march. [inaudible] Halt. [speaking german] [command] [music playing] [inaudible] march. [music playing] [inaudible] [chatter] Wait a minute, wait a minute. [interposing voices] No sign of them yet. Take it easy, sir. It's assembling Albertthat bothers me, you know? That, and getting him outof the bathhouse, of course. Well, they've rehearsed it enough. Well, they'll make it, all right. I don't envy Fred at this moment. Don't you, Henry? You are right. I do. [interposing voices] [speaking german] March. [music playing] [inaudible] Halt. [speaking german] [chatter] Forward march. [speaking german] It's Albert, sir. They've made it. [interposing voices] In you go. Sit down. You deserve it. Everything ship-shape, Ainsworth? Went through without a hitch, sir. Well done. I hate to do it again tomorrow, though. Me, too. It's the last party of the day so Fred could take his time getting out. Guess it'll be evening roll call in a minute. We'll have them in the middle file, sir. Should work at all right. Well, try and keep it up for a week. That'll give Erickson a real chance. Yeah, that Fred's a lucky guy. Tonight, he'll be sleepingout under the stars. [inaudible] up in a women'slabor camp, more likely. If he does, he'll be there for the duration. [inaudible],, the most popular girl in camp. With any luck, he should be in Lubeck tomorrow, looking for a ship. Hey, poor old Albert. You guys ever think thatwhen we're all out of here, he'll be left alone, holding the Fort? Listen, gentlemen. Let's face it. Any plan, even the best of them,depends, to a great extent, on luck. If Erickson gets through,he'll have used up a lot of it. Albert will fall in on a roll call every day for a week to give Erickson a fair chance. After that, Albert will gointo dry dock for a spell. Dry dock? Well, for how long? A month at least. A month? That's a lifetime. I'm sorry. You must try to be patient. Why do we have to be patient? I said a month, Norton. That's orders. Yes, sir. [chatter] [command] Wonder what Schultz is going to do. Blow up or burst into flames? Look at the old man's face. He can't wait to tell them. Yeah, it's all right for him. He knows he's got to stay here. You'll get your chance to go. Oh, yeah? Well, I'm not waiting. I'm going to go right through that wire. No girl is worth it. Not even one in a sailor hat. [speaking german] Herr Capitan, I'm happy to inform you that we're one man short today. I'm sorry to hear that, Herr Capitan. [speaking german] [laughter] [harmonica playing] You know what? Young Mike starts the school next term. Yeah? Come on. Snap out of it, Geoff. You'll get a letter next mail. You know damn well I won't.I don't. Why shouldn't you? Because she stopped writing, that's why. I haven't heard a line for over a month. Well, that doesn't mean anything. There must be a lot of mailthat's going west to the rate. Well, I should have known, Jim. When it happened, there was nothing else she could do but just not write. When what happened? When she found someone else. Oh, come off it, Geoff. Well, why not, Jim? It had to happen sooner or later. Well, don't talk drivel after she's waited for four years for you. That's just it. Four years. And I'm still here. And he's there. She never even set eyes on me. What are you going to do about it? What do you expect me to do? Put in for compassionate leave? I say, Geoff, do you know what? Someone in room four has just offered me 5,000 cigarettes for Albert.What? Well, how'd he find out about it? Well, I don't know. Bound to leak out sometime, I suppose. Too good a story not to. What did you say? I just told him I didn'tknow anyone of that name. I was a stranger around here. Good. Oh, by the way, we're having the next draw as soon as the match is over.Yeah, I know. We're coming right over. Well, jolly good luck. See you in prison. All right, I know. Maybe I'll win the draw. Why wait for the draw? Why not just step up andclaim your right to Albert? It's too late for that, Jim. I can't go along now and say, Albert works. Fred proved it. My turn, please. You know, Geoff, the trouble with you is you dream up a situationthat needs facing, and then you give yourself allthe reasons for not facing it. That's not true. Isn't it? Now, let's supposing you won the draw. Would you go? What's the use of supposing? It's one chance in eight. Would you go? Yes. Yes, I'd go. [door knock] Come in. Well, what is it, Reed? It's time for the draw on Albert, sir. All fixed, eh? Yes, sir. There's a cross on every slip. It's a lot to ask of any man togive up his chance of freedom. You sure they're all willing? I think so, sir. I've talked to them all. One or two weren't very keen on the idea, but I think I've convinced them. Texas? I don't think he'll let us down, sir. All right. Let's get going. Well, how did the game go? Match abandoned, sir. Hank hit the ball through the wire. [inaudible] to the 1944 league finals, anyway. Eight slips. All right, who's first? First's as good as last. No go. Better luck next time. So I say, farewell to my [inaudible].. She's been a happy ship. She'd better be becauseI'm still going to be here. Texas, here I come. But not this trip. Oh, well. Hampstead will still be there. How about you, Geoff? Uh-uh. This is my luck. First class ticket to Montreal? And return. [inaudible] it looks like you. I'll send you a score card from [inaudible].. Yup. Somebody will send me one. Well, who's got it? Well, somebody must have won it. Have another look. I have it. [interposing voices] Nice work. Good work, Geoff. Good work. Glad you made it, Ainsworth. We'll have the clothes and papers laid on. The best of luck. Thank you, sir. It's about time you had some luck. Yeah. I wouldn't say no to a ticketto London, bus bombs and all. Let's get Albert out and give him a run through. Good idea. Hank, you could takeGeoff's place in the drill. Cutter? Wait a minute. I've got a ticket for sale. Does anybody want to buy it? My chance on Albert to the highest bidder. Geoff, are you crazy? Well, come on. What am I bid? No, there's nothing in the wholecamp worth a chance on Albert. I'll take the highest offer. OK, I'll give you my chronometer for it. Good. Do I get a better bid? Aw, Geoff. For God's sake. And 200 cigarettes. Can anyone beat that? No? And going, going, gone. Sold to the gentleman from Texas. And what exactly has been sold? My chance on Albert to the highest bidder, sir. There it is, and it's all mine. I'm sorry, the deal's off. Well, I made him. I can do what I like with him, sir. Oh, no you can't, Ainsworth. You're just one man, but you'vegot to think of the whole camp. Albert is our way out, not a ruddy prize on the black market. Hand him back that slip. I'm sorry, Norton, but that's the way it is. Ainsworth, on Thursday, when we go to the bars, see that you have everything ready. Aye, aye, sir. [bell ringing] [chatter] The lunch bell has sounded. Mm. I heard it. I'm not hungry. Are you sick? I'm sick of sauerkraut and skilly. I see you still have yourchronometer, Lieutenant Norton. Yeah. You are better off without it. Oh? How come? You will count the minutes. That is bad. It only makes them pass more slowly. Yeah, could be. Come, I'm interested. What would you take for it? There's only one thing I want. That's to get out of here. Well, let us remain inthe realm of the possible. This camp is escape proof. Is it? What about Fred Erickson? He made it, didn't he? Did he? You know darn well he did. I know what I know. Now, let us talk business. You want some schnapps? I don't drink bourbon. But you can trade with it. A bottle a week for so many weeks. I don't intend to stay here and rot. You have no alternative, my friend. Haven't I? Well, have it your own way.Wait a minute. You'd like thischronometer, wouldn't you? Well? You can have it in exchangefor a little cooperation. Cooperation? You control the lights at the wire, don't you? That is so. Well, they could fail, couldn't they? When? The next time we have an air raid? If you're in the system committing suicide, that is your fare. Danke schoen. [speaking german] Special announcement. By order of the Kommandant, all officers will assemble on theparade ground immediately. Blasted. I'll never finish this book. You have plenty of time. Schultz on the war path again, I'll bet. I wonder what charming ideahe's thought up this time. Come on, Geoff. Sorry. Go on. Hey, what's the matter? You sore at me? [chatter] [speaking german] [command] In a few minutes, gentlemen,I have bad news for you. The duties of a prison officerare not always pleasant. There are times, however, that we should forget that we are enemies and join in common sorrow. Captain Maddox, I have the sad duty to bring you the remains of your comrade, Lieutenant Frederick Erickson of Hollywood, America, who escapedfrom this camp last month and was captured by the gestapo at Lubeck. I have his certificate. He was shot by a resisting arrest. Let me see it. He will accorded the same treatment as though he fell honorablyon the field of battle. Received in honor. Here in this casket are his ashes. The funeral will take place at noon tomorrow. And please accept this wreath with sympathy from the [inaudible]. Captain Maddox, I salute abrave man, but a foolish one. That's all. You may dismiss the company. Company dismissed. [chatter] Boy, oh, boy. Hamburg's certainly making ithard for them tonight, huh? How many planes do you think there are, Jim? 500, maybe. Maybe more. Watch it. Damn these [inaudible] as if you were standing in the middle of Hampton Heath with neon lights on your perimeter. Oh, no. That's odd. What? Boundary lights have gone out. Never done that before. Goons are jittery tonight. [inaudible] Let's have some lights. Come on. Close those dunkles. They're right above us. [inaudible] up there for a mistake. What's it matter? If your number's up,it's up wherever you are. That's the way I look at it. I guess you're right. If it's a direct hit, you'rejust as dead whether you're in a dugout or a flimsy hut. Sounds like one of ours in a hurry. Back to his gin and our women. So what? He's done a good job, hasn't he? You'll be headed that way tomorrow. And I'll be there waiting for you. What's the idea? Come off, I'm getting out. Wish me luck. Where you going, kid? Through the wire the way Fred planned it, only I got influence. But we haven't given you clearance. Ha. Laugh that one off. I get mine when I'm through. You're mad, Tex. Not yet, but I will be if I stay here waiting for my chance on Albert. For God's sake, Tex, wait. You forget, I'm a Texan. You can't fence them in. They got to get up and go. Don't be a bloody fool, man. Got to stop it. Let him go. He's going to trounce on his own. He's right, Hank. Let him be. Douse the lamp. He's got got to make it, Jim. He's got to make it. Let's hope there's a second wave. Come on, Henry, you old praying mantis. If you got any routines, let's have them now. Oh God, our Father, with whomall things are possible-- Give this poor kid a break. Stretch out your hand to protect him. The boundary line's [inaudible]. Not Geoff, thank God. Maybe that's meant he meant by influence. Can you still see him? He's got [inaudible]. No. Lost him in the shadows. The lights go on now, he hasn't got a chance. [inaudible] in the nameof Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen. What's going on here? It's Texas, [inaudible]. He's trying to get through the wire, sir. Crazy fool. All right. Exit stations. Create a diversion. [interposing voices] [singing] [gunshot] [singing] [gunshots] He was happy enough. Playing his guitar, boastingabout his [inaudible],, until I made Albert. Then he started counting the days and the hours, then the minutes, until hecouldn't wait any longer. If there hadn't been an Albert, there-- Geoff, listen to me. Albert had nothing to do with it. Hadn't he? What about Fred? He died with Albert's blessing. Now, take it easy, Ainsworth. Erickson took a chance. No plan of escape guaranteessafe conduct to the border. He just had bad luck. Bad luck. As for young Norton, his escape was illegal. If he comes back alive, he'll face a court martial for disobeying orders. I beg to inform your Captain that one of your officers, Lieutenant Norton, has been killed while attempting to escape. There will, of course, be an inquiry. I would remind you, gentlemen,that the record of [inaudible] remains unblemished. This camp is still escape proof. Heil Hitler. Oh, I'll never know. I'll never know. Get up and go. Poor kid. He'd have never made it. All right, that's enough. Ainsworth. Yes, sir. You will escape tomorrow morningthrough Albert as planned. Aye aye, sir. [music playing] [command] [speaking german] March. [music playing] Any sign of them yet, Brennan? No, sir. Well, I hope he'll make it. He's been here long enough. We all have, for that matter. Perhaps you'll be lucky next time. Everything all right at helm, Brennan? Yes, sir. Thank you. Bad luck last night, young Norton. You didn't like him very much, did you? No. He said rather a curious thing last night, just after he was shot. What will you never know, Brennan? Look, Joe. How long have we known each other? 25 years? About that, yes. I remember scrubbing decks together. I'm still the same bloke, you know? In spite of all this. Can't I help you? I don't want to pry into your business. It was her. I know it was. It was my Mary. What? The woman he was always talking about. They had an affair. He said so. Are you sure of this? Of course I'm sure. I might have known. She was young and pretty. What proof have you got? Proof? I have no proof. That's what's sending me round the bend. I'm sure of it, but I'll never really know. Well, listen, Joe. Exactly what evidencehave you got that Norton's girlfriend was your wife? Enough. In the [inaudible] station at Plymouth, working at the canteen, young, fair, pretty. It was her, all right. Well, good heavens, man. There must be dozens of [inaudible] station at Plymouth who answer that description. Maybe. But this was my Mary, I know it. You mean, you've made up your mind to it? [command] If you like. What was that? Oh, they're back. [chatter] [command] [inaudible] [speaking german] [inaudible] Forward march. [command] Well, all correct, sir. Went like clockwork. Good, that's marvelous. We're actually getting prettygood at it now, after all this [inaudible]. Albert's even learning to wash behind the ears. [interposing voices] There. Now, who's got a cigarette for me? Oh, not again. I'll suffer. It's 20 minutes since we left. Thanks, [inaudible]. Yes, he should be in the woods by now. Lucky old devil. Good morning, gentlemen. Here for room count. Room count? What for? To make sure everyone is back from the bathhouse. Now, if you please-- Well, if you insist. Now, look. Have you got a pencil? Nein. Wow. [inaudible] hasn't got a pencil. [interposing voices] Here you are, Herman. Thank you. Use the pointed end of it. All right. I'll call them out and you check them, eh? Yah, yah. [inaudible] Aye, sir. Erins? Sure. Brennan? Yes, sir. Dawson? Aye, sir. Reed? Yes, sir. Barton? Yes, sir. Ainsworth. Sir? And myself. There. You satisfied? Yah, yah. Always I'm satisfied. That's all right, then. This man was found in the bathhouse by two guards returning to the camp. What happened, Ainsworth? We've had a bit of bad luck, sir. So it seems. Herman, [speaking german] So you had a bit of bad luck, huh? Yes. Pity, wasn't it? Yeah, tough. [speaking german] Now, Ainsworth is marked as present. Why? The count was correct, [inaudible].. That cannot be. Eight names on the list, and nine men. We have one more prisoner than we have. Who is here? Who is not here? Answer. Come on. [speaking german] A strip search [speaking german] You will all line up against your bunks. [speaking german] You there, in the chair. Stand up. Come on, man. You heard what Uncle Shultz said. He's not feeling very well today. No, he isn't. Doesn't Look too well, either. Take it easy, pal. Get up, I said. Well, let's give him a hand, shall we? [interposing voices] What's the matter with that man? Schultz. Stop bullying us, will you? Because you've got a gun in your hand, you think you're another bloody Hitler. What did you say? Why don't you put that gun down? Let's see how much of a man you are. Do not provoke me. You daren't, you filthy,murdering, degenerate swine. [inaudible] Throw Albert. [interposing voices] [speaking german] What is going on here? I wish to lodge thestrongest possible complaint. He was striking a defenseless prisoner. He was intimidating anofficer of the third Reich. For what reason? I have reason to believehe was planning to escape. Can you get up? You all right, Ainsworth? I'm all right. What is all this nonsenseabout one prisoner too many? Here is the list, Herr Capitan. Eight names, eight men. Where is the discrepancy? A moment ago, there were nine. Isn't that so? [speaking german] wasting my time. You will leave this matter to me, Schultz. Heil Hitler. Herr Capitan, please accept my apologies. Take this man to thehospital, then to the bunker to await his hearing. [german], Herr Capitan. Good morning, Herr Capitan. Good morning. Nice work, Ainsworth. Now, gentlemen, let's relax, shall we? [interposing voices] [music playing] Brennan. Sir? Can you spare me a minute? Come in. Come in here. Sit down. Thank you, sir. They sent young Norton's effects this afternoon. And I've just been going through them. I found a picture in his wallet, and I think you ought to see it. No. Why not? You better face up to it and get it over. Suspicion's a poor bedfellow. I don't want to know. I think you've got to. To Texas, from his own honey. February, 1944. She's young, she's fair, she's pretty. Look. No. Listen, Joe. You've got to look at this photograph. If it doesn't show awife, you've been worrying yourself silly for nothing. If it is her, then you're noworse off than you are now. Better, in fact, because youknow exactly where you are. Come on, then. I can't. You tell me. Honey was not your wife. Texas was right. She's quite pretty. [speaking german] You appear to be happy [inaudible] Ainsworth. I was until a moment ago. Stand up when you speak to me. Take your hands out of your pockets. Being an artist is no excuse for slovenliness. Filth. Decadent filth. What's the matter, Schultz? Did she let you down again tonight? It's all right, Schultz. I'm not that much of a fool. You could hardly shoot me forattempting to escape from here, could you? Perhaps you're right. There are better uses for a bullet. Come. Let us talk business. Just what do you want? I wish to know how it was the count could be correct at thebathhouse at the main gate and in the room. Quite a blow to your pride, wasn't it? There's no harm in telling me now. Come, I'll make a bargain with you. You're pretty good atmaking bargains, aren't you? Yeah, I think so. But not so good at keeping them. What do you mean? Does your new watch keep good time? What? Or should I say, chronometer? An American airman's chronometer, one I saw young Texas give you. Do you suggest that I-- Did he love you so much that he gave it to you? Or was it a bargain? That is enough. A bargain to let him getthrough the wire, was that it? Except you didn't lethim get through the wire. He was shot while attempting to escape. Attempting to escape. Murdered, you mean. You fooled him into trusting you, then shot him in cold blood. Your confinement hassurely deranged your mind. I don't think so. That's what happened, Schultz, wasn't it? Well, what if it did? What are you going to do about it? When the war is won, I'm going to see you hanged. I, too, will warn you. The war will still be long, and we shall have to bear with one another for quite some time yet. There will be changes. You will not find your campso comfortable in future. In fact, when I have finished with you, you'll wish you had never been born. All of you. [record playing] This is the third day, and itstill hasn't stopped raining. Might just as well be in England. I say, listen to this, chaps. Cousin Tony has been takenprisoner and is in Starleg 8B. His mother says, can you pop round and see him? Well, the old girl must be cracked. Is my week up already? Yes, time flies, doesn't it? Actually, you had an extra 3 and 1/2 minutes. Oh, thank you. Yeah, yeah, chaps. So is a farewell to thatold Irish mother of ours. Listen, how about this? Poor [inaudible] has been sentto Canada and is very homesick. Can you write and cheer him up? [inaudible] Speaking of cheering people up,Geoff's due out of the bunker today. Say, how about rigging upold Albert to welcome him? Not a bad idea. Where the head? Gerty's got it. Don't reckon they'd want to see Albert. I don't see why not. No? Maybe Fred and Texas could tell you. Now, wait a minute, Hank. Why? Albert didn't help them much, did he? Well, that wasn't Geoff's fault. When it came to his turn, hedidn't do so good, either. Whatever he did or whatever he didn't do, I say we should forget all about it. And for once, Joseph, I agree with you. Thank you, Henry. OK. That goes for Albert, too. We're better off without him. He was just a gag that didn't work. All the same, it was rather fun drawing lots. You got a kick out of it, even if we lost. Just like buying a ticketin the early sweepstakes. Yeah. On a clotheshorse. And the odds were just about as good. Hank, that's not true. Albert was a great idea and you know it. Albert was a jinx. Two men dead and one [inaudible].. What's so great about that? Oh, hello, Geoff. Glad to see you back. [interposing voices] Let's have a look at you. All right, I [inaudible]. Come on, Geoff. [inaudible] Another time, Geoff. No, now, do you mind? After 30 days solitary, it's a luxury to talk. You made a mistake. It was just bad luck. Geoff, forget it. We have. There seemed good reasonsat the time for waiting. There always do. Now I know they were just excuses. Hank's right. I [inaudible]. Provided that's quiteclear, let's go from there. Oh, hello, Ainsworth. I thought I heard your voice. Nice to have you back. Thank you, sir. Well, what sort ofattire did they give you? Not too bad, sir. Good. I expect you want to settle down. I'll see you later. Oh, by the way, these letters came for you. Oh, thank you, sir. One from Madison, must have gone adrift. You amaze me. You wished to see me, Captain? Yes. I want to say goodbye. Goodbye? Yes, I'm afraid so. You mean, you're leaving us? Tomorrow morning, I hand over my command. I see. Then may I say, on behalf of all of us here, that we should bevery sorry to see you go. We've appreciated your efforts to entertain us and your difficulties. Thank you. I've tried to be fair, not forgotten that I, too, am a Naval officer. Goodbye. When we meet again, I hope it'llbe in happier surroundings. Thank you. Oh, by the way, do you happen toknow who the new commandant is going to be? Yes. [inaudible] Fuhrer Schultz. Was not of my choosing. Schultz. Price a ticket home now, eh? Oh, cheer up, chaps. It all will be over by Christmas. Don't spoil it. Just can't wait to see Schultz as Santa Claus. Anybody got a spare letter card?Yes, sir. I have. Oh, thank you. Sir, I'd-- I'd like to make a request. Yes? I wish to claim my rightto escape through Albert. Well, anybody any objections? Then it's agreed. Well, well, well. I know you can't wait to kiss us all goodbye. Times change. Officers of [inaudible] partaking of baths, to parade at the gate immediately. Ainsworth. Yes, sir. Just a minute. Ainsworth, I'll be verygrateful if you do something for me when you get home. Wondered if you'd go down to see my wife. Of course I will, sir. You will? Oh, thanks very much. Here's the address. Learn it and destroy it. She'll be very glad to see you. She's been finding it a bit lonely since-- since we lost our other boy. Oh, no. Yes. I heard last week. His first ship. Is there any message I can give her, sir? No. No, just tell her about us,and say that nothing's changed. And good luck. Thank you, sir. Oh, don't thank me. It's you we have to thank for Albert. He's more than just paintand paper, you know? He's our refusal to accept all this. Don't worry. We'll take great care of him. I know you will, sir. Goodbye. Goodbye, sir. [command] [chatter] [command] I will inspect them. [speaking german] What have you in there? Just things for the bath. Chocolate? For the bath. It gives me an appetite. It's confiscated. Here, wait a minute. I say-- Oh, Joe, did you bring that soap? Yes, I did. Good. Open it. Look here. That's my personal property sentto me by the British Red Cross. For consumption inside the camp. For consumption anywhere. Go back to your room. Your bath is stopped. Stopped? But I'm absolutely filthy. Go back. All right. So long, chaps. Clod. Things will be a little different now. There will be no more of these foolish games. You will not smile tomorrow. Any of you. [inaudible] Thought we'd had it. Good old [inaudible]. March. Looks like Hamburg's getting it again. I hope Geoff's not around. Ah, but then he'd likely bemiles beyond Hamburg by now. We've made it this time. You know, there were hutsgetting quite spacious. [inaudible] soon. It will tomorrow whenSchultz gets through with us. Lucky old Geoff. I still can't figure that guy. Oh, and you never will. What was that? Skip it. Does seem funny without the old basket. Anyway, we've still got Albert. Good old Albert. The ideal roommate. Well, we've got him. We've got hope. Thanks to Geoff. If he keeps going, he oughtto make Lubeck by dawn. [bombs exploding] What are you doing here? Waiting for you, Schultz. How did you get here? You'd like to know, wouldn't you? I've waited a long time for this moment. [gunshot] [bombs exploding] I will arrange that your escape remains undiscovered for one week. You won't be there to arrange it. I will sign an order thatwill give you safe conduct. I already have one. No. No, you will not shoot. You shot Texas. You are not me. You have not the courage. Let me go back to the camp now, and I-- No, Schultz. You're not going back there ever. We must take cover. Stay where you are. [speaking german] [music playing]
