IN REHEARSAL. It's him. Jojo, call your sister. Call your sister. Call her yourself. - What? What? Of. .. Good. Oh, you! Respect your father. Slap. Are you coming, yes or...? Good replica, that. You're here ? You don't want to see me like this. Stop! Stop. Stop, stop. What was that? That wasn't it. Not it at all. Are you saying this for my benefit? - Yes, among the others. You're playing it too weakly, pal. I'm playing weakly? Well... What about Jojo? What's that about Jojo? Tougher... They're supposed to be able to hit you and you feel no pain. If Mademoiselle put in more of this and less of that, it would work. - You can work, you. In three hours, you'll be working. And our good mother, she's going to sleep. I'm going to sleep? You must be dreaming. I know you're tired... - We have nothing left to give. You've broken us. You could have given us today off. You'd revive? - No, I want to be in my bed. With who? - Mind your own business. Come on, we'll be finished in 8 days. A little conviction, a little ambiance. Ambiance? You think that she brings ambiance, her? We blame it on the debutante. It's not your playing, it's your costume. What about my costume? - It ruins the whole thing. Antoine is right. - There, see. What? - It turns this into a carnival. According to you. - I can't act seriously... Your talent disappears on the breeze. It's like being in the circus. You think you're in a blockbuster? You should thank me. Otherwise, you'd neer have this chance. Have you ever seen a flowered fringe like that? And these shoes. - These silk stockings. This skirt. - This shawl. What about this shawl, these stockings and this skirt? The flowers are perhaps okay. They look quite distinguished to me. -Ah there you have it, distinguished. You're starting to get on my wick. - That's enough! This here is enough. It's enough to die of laughter. My costume is taking away their livelihoods. Take it off. This will resolve everything. I know. But do you think it is perhaps for my own pleasure that I'm wearing it? It's to go to a ball with your sponsor. That's true. If Marcel Verdier sponsors us... He believes in my work. - Of course... One word from Lise and we'll all be unemployed again. But she won't say it. She's a good girl. She'll be nice to Verdier. It's this. Are you the director? Come on, in all good faith... He adores you, let him adore you. Eh? Is that so bad? Give him nothing, but don't deter him up until January 5th. After the dress rehearal, you can send him out on his ear. We are totally dependent on him. Hello. Hard at work? Congratulations. Actors work while everyone else rests. I've come to take Lise away. But how's this, my dear... What's this? A garden? It's your passport to the ball. - I don't want to go. My costume is so ridiculous. - But it's charming. Nobody's ever seen a flower seller looking like this. I look like anyone, except a flower seller. I find your costume ideal. - No, she's joking. Her friends find it delicious. Isn't that so? - Oh yes. This costume makes us feel like we are in the disguises of a carnival. Not like figures of the circus. Have you seen her pretty shoes? And those stockings? - And that shawl? You see, Lise. - You all sicken me. She's nervous. - Artists get like this before the dress rehearsal. Yes, of course. It's nothing. I haven't shown you my costume. How handsome he is. What are you disguised as? - A toreador. You see... - Come on... It shows off my calves. It makes your legs beautiful. But you can run along. What? - No, no... You are tired. - Of seeing you. I have soup for this year. Until next year. Wait for the right moment. Where are you going? - I'm leaving. Don't leave like this. What will your friends say? Think about your career. - No. Of me. - You think about that enough for two. You are ungrateful. I had hoped that at last you would be mine. That will have to wait for another time. Don't be so silly. Come back. - No, never. What are you doing? - I'm not going out. Good. Me neither. You can't outrun me. I'm not giving up on you. Very well. Go and get my bag and my coat. I'll be quick. Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! Take me... - Let's see the colour of your money first. I'll pay afterwards. Oh no, I'm having none of that today. Some other time. You have a nice little mouth. It's forbidden. - What? It's the rules. - It's for the telephone. Impossible with that in your arms. Lend me a token. - Lend you one? I'll settle up with you later. The telephone is reserved for the clientele. How much is it? - "How much"? Oh---... How much is the token? - IF. 2F, sir. - Keep it all. Thank you, sir. Keep it all. If Mademoiselle will allow me... What number? Maillot 7020. Oh, violets. What a nice thought. I'll telephone, reserve us a good table. Is this the answering service? Ah, my maid is out? Ah, very well... She didn't say where she was going? Oh... how annoying. What does this mean? - Mr. Jacques... You, out. No need to be rude. Out. It was made perfctlt clear to you. - It was a misunderstanding. Big words for a flower seller. - No, I'm... It doesn't matter. I must speak to my maid. I'm waiting for her. Why are you so prejudiced against flower sellers? Her maid... Prejudiced against flower sellers... Robert. Take care of Mademoiselle. Your insistance is out of place. Gaston! Come on, we'll show you the way out. I told you I'm waiting for someone! Oh, what a brute! Strange manners, my friend. Pardon, I'm late. An irritation before leaving. You didn't want to wait for me? Gaston. It is Gaston? Yes... Will you gather together these flowers, please? In the basket. With a little art. You have good taste, I'm sure. Right now. Lend a hand. This probably is your idea of art. It wasn't worth the trouble of disturbing you. Thank you. Here. I think that's everything. Have I held you up? - I don't know you. Oh for heaven's sake, do we have to know someone to help them? I don't know you and yet, I helped you. Because of the flowers? - "The flowers"? Yes, why not? Shall we go in? - Why, sir? Out of fancy, out of caprice. Okay. But you're weird. Yes, weird. Very weird. And you don't know it all. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,13,14,15,16. How much for them all? - That depends. On the customer? - Yes. You don't want to? Quite the opposite, I want them all. The basket, the flowers, the night... The seller. I didn't say that. - You would, though. At least, the basket, the flowers... Without the seller. Wholesale price. There. - Thank you, sir. Good evening, sir. - Nothing more? What are you trying to say? But what can I do? Try this. A stopping of the hands, a halt in time. A pause in its passing. A door opening on the future. The year is coming to an end. Will the good times start? I don't understand. Is it too difficult? If you stay, I'll explain it to you. Have you ever read the stories, mademoiselle ? Fairy tales? - Naturally, there's no other kind. Yes, I've read them. I'm someone from a fairy tale. Impossible! I have this hon our. - Seriously? I am king of a wonderful country, the land of eternal springtime. I rule over the seasons. At my will, the sun rises, sets, the wind blows or the breeze gives up its freshness. That must be beautiful. It's better than beautiful. It's true. Really? - Crystal clear. Have you heard talk of Eldorado? The music hall? Oh---... Eldorado is not my kingdom. My kingdom is rather... Well, the important thing is... No, I travel incognito. Once a year, I remove my mask, on New Year's Eve. Today. And for you. Ask me for a miracle. "A miracle"? - I explained it badly. It is more like an enchantment. - What are you going to do? Very simple. I am going to change the violet seller into a princess. Forever? - Alas, no. The enchantment has its limits. For one night only, that of New Year's Eve. The most mysterious of nights. Do you accept? What? - The metamorphosis. Is it safe? On my hon our! The hon our of a king and an enchanter. Wait. We haven't forgotten anything? This... This... This... - Ah no. This. This, yes. Of course, it's the most expensive. This... Ah... Here. It takes what it takes. You have everything, in your hotel. Like I told you. Every year, on New Year's Eve, we transform a poor young girl, a worker, into a princess until the following morning. This year, it's a flower seller. And afterwards? "Afterwards"? Nothing. We return. You'll give me a sign, for next year. Who knows where we'll be next year? We travel a great deal. Come on, let's go. Come in. If the gentleman has everything?... I'm talking about you. Nothing's missing? Oh, absolutely nothing, sir. Gloves, stockings, handbag, shoes, coat, fur, girdle... and below. An ensemble Of the highest luxury. Thank you, Constant. Drop it all off at 25. The young lady will decide. Some suggestions may perhaps be necessary?... No. Let's trust to instinct. She is a Parisienne. Here, the lowliest girl can show a little taste, compared to the aristocracy of the New World. That's what my grand-father said. She has a good nose... and the rest belongs to Paris. Exactly. - Exactly. One minute, Constant. - Yes, sir. They surprise sir?... - Yes. What does this mean? I thought I'd done well, sir. They are mine. Sir forgets that last year, in these circumstances... Ah yes, yes. That little blonde. With the big eyes full of dreams. I treasure pleasant memories of her. - And she treasures your cufflinks. Constant. My devotion is leading you astray. Go find my cufflinks. What perfection! The enchanters are overtaken by the great couturiers. You're confusing me. I am very emotional. I am stressed. You mustn't be. Will you accept a word of advice? From you, yes. Then raise your head... arch your back, and look straight ahead. A certain contempt for the world doesn't hurt beauty. Put on some disdain. I'm putting it on. I'm taking you to the most amusing place in Paris. We'll eat? - Are you hungry? The phrase is famished. If you want to make me happy, we're going to the Imperator. - To the Imperator? But the service has gone downhill. The service treats us... ...not without rudeness. But in the end, as you wish. To the Imperator. Flowers. Violets, of course. They're so modest. Yes, a tablecloth of flowers. An ocean of violets. For the Eve, every table is reserved. A good table for two? - This way. Good evening. It's a customer. You know her? - Of course. She sold me a bouquet of violets. - A society woman? She is not a society woman. - Better and better! What about my bouquet? - The young man returned it to her. What are you going on about? Explain yourself. We're sitting here? - It's a good table. The best. - But what about that? The chandelier? - It's dangerous. What do you think? We're fine. Oysters to start? Or caviar? It moved. What did? - The chandelier. Couldn't we do without? - No, madame. We were speaking of caviar? I suppose that it doesn't bother you to be exposed. To what? - To being crushed. It's been there for 25 years. - Exactly. It ought to have fallen already. It's due to, tonight. - She's right. It is abnormal that is hasn't fallen at least once. I can assure you... - That's not all. It's ugly. - Oh! It is of its time. But it's ugly. It's moving more and more. Yes, it's shaking. We cannot stay here. Change tables. Come on. Pardon, madame. - Please. That chandelier doesn't seem secure. Change places. What's going on? It's... the chandelier. - "The chandelier"? A customer is scared of it. - Scared of the chandelier? She said that it's going to fall. What nonsense! Where is she? There. You stay here. I'll take care of it. Madame, sir, I assure you... This is disturbing you? - Our safety doesn't bother you. Please. - Prove it. Remove the chandelier. Now? The room is full. - All the more reason. It would be a historic catastrophe. Remember the fire at the Charity Ball. What's the connection? That chandelier is the connection. It's going to fall. My premonitions never fail me. I believe you, madame. But think of the disruption, of all the difficulties. I don't have any workmen to hand. That chandelier is heavy. - That's for sure. It's dangerous. Manager... Manager, look at those cracks in the ceiling. Three cracks three fingers wide. Three fingers. It's criminal stealth. Bravo. You won't see me again. But madame... Sort it out. It's necessary, I'm afraid. Madame? (Walk softly. The cracks are enlargening.) Tell me... - Shush. You must halt the orchestra. It's causing the chandelier to vibrate. Orchestra, vibrations, dangerous. Pass it on. What is it? Why are you shushing? (The chandelier.) What? Shush. - Why are you shushing? It's too much... She steals my flowers and wants to silence me. Will it be oysters? Caviar? We'll see. What are you having? Well, I... Ch! You're forgetting that I've dined. It's true. I wasn't thinking. Me too. It's very natural, with all these emotions. We won't have dinner. Very good, sir. Send the wine waiter. - At once, sir. Wine waiter. Madame, sir. What would you like to drink? Oh, nothing. I'm not thirsty. It's weird. Neither am I. Thank you. We don't need anything. Very good, sir. Let's go. Why are we in a restaurant if we're not going to eat? You're right. Let's go. I'm getting more and more famished. Hey! Keep the noise down! Madame, sir. Let me tell you... - What an outburst! Sir has ruined your business. I would like to see that! You have your wish. Why are they smashing the glasses? - It's a custom. The happier they get, the more crockery they smash. We mustn't stand out from the crowd. Oh! Bravo! Simply... life flows from day to day and everyone takes their turn without joy and without sorrow, but then suddenly, by the will of destiny, another way is opened to us We are not lacking in wisdom... A caprice can sometimes be a very dangerous game. A caprice can make the heart unhappy. Nevertheless, under the spell of the moment, it all looks beautiful to us. And yet, we hesitate... Is it allowed to live a wonderful dream, and follow with closed eyes the love that invites us? A caprice can sometimes be a dangerous game. A caprice can make the heart unhappy. I'll take you home. Where do you live? I'll try to guess. - Yes. Let's see... Montmartre. Clignancourt. Belleville. Croulebarbe. Les Buttes-Chaumont. Yes, that's it. And which street? Rue Hassard. - No. -Rue des Alouettes. Rue de la Liberte. - Yes. Lucien, rue de la Liberte. Hey... Hey! We're there. Which number? A little further down, 22. Tell me... I'm listening. - I'll return my disguise. No, I'll return your clothes. - Here? Why not? - No. I'll get them. I want to do it myself. I'm late for my flower selling. It's my fault. I'll buy them from you in advance. - Ah no. You cannot refuse. Thank you. Thank you for for this, and for everything else. Farewell. Farewell. And happy new year. Happy new year. Let's go. Who is it? Who is it? Do you have a free apartment? You seem very sure of yourself. At this hour? People must be allowed to sleep. Yes, it is early. - Indeed. I beg your pardon. This is for your inconvenience. And happy new year. - Thank you. Oh---... Happy new year! Go on. What do I say? - "No re-entry." No re-entry. What's she doing? It's curious. Relax. She'll be back, your daughter. "Hello. You weren't worried?" Hello. You weren't worried? No. - Have you thought it over? I will never marry that person. - No, no, no! Stop! That's not it at all. Come on. You're not here this morning, Lise. What's with you? Is it your wanderings last night with your enchanter? What an idea to bring that up. - Calm down. Go on. Take yourself off. It's only natural. Come back in 8 days, lassie. Oh, I don't think so. What? Who's putting on this here show? That would be you, you old goat. But who is the sponsor here? Marcel. He's going to sign the lease for the theatre at 3pm. I didn't know. He told you something? - Yes, a little something. I've tried everything, but it's better I tell you: there's nothing more we can do to stop him packing in the theatre... ...and taking me with him to his chateau. But it's a crime! What about my play? It's something. We're stuffed. - We're heading for skid row. Don't worry about me. - Who was it? Ask that of Lise. We deserve an explanation. Yes, I'm the guilty one. I sent her for a walk. - Oh! Marcel wanted it all arranged so that I fell into his arms. He has fallen back on Friquette. She gets life in a chateau. But what about my play? And your promises? It's 10 years of my life. You might have thought a little. I'm upset for you all. You've done this for me... This play was our only hope. What shall I do with this rag, sir? Fold the dress up carefully. We will return it to his owner before leaving Paris. We? Very well, sir. But if sir will allow me... The sort of person who refuses a fur coat... is not someone who needs such a cut-price piece. Have you become a psychologist? - No, I'm packing the bags. Tell me something, Lise. Your enchanter offered you dresses, a fur coat? Yes. And the note to buy your flowers, that you gave to the concierge, was it a 100 note, or 500? A 1000. - 1000? In short, rich, touched in the head and generous. Will you see him again? No, never. But he must bring your dress back to that lousy house. This is an important point she makes. It is capital. I see. I see... I see it perfectly. It's a question of direction. This is my business. Listen to me everyone. You said 22 rue de la Liberte? Yes. Why? - Ah! Oh, look at that beautiful car! Come on, children. Come on... Sir hasn't thought of going up himself? No. It would be more suitable if it was me? Yes. - Good. What do you want? - Mlle Lise, please. 2nd floor, at the end of the corridor. You know her? - Oh, hardly. She needs it, because, between us, her family... 2nd floor, at the end of the corridor. Thank you, madame. Mademoiselle Lise? What do you want? I've come to give her... No, to her in person. Jojo... Ah, it's him. Ah, ah, it's him. Call your sister. Call her yourself. You'll see... Oh, what? There's the bottle, it's you. This comedy disgusts me. You're not trying to back out? You must look the part. Come on, get up. Oh, wait. Respect your father. - Lise! Some guy for you. You coming, yes or...? - Very realistic. Oh no, I can't. - Oh! You... What now? (Prompt her.) "You're here? You shouldn't see me like this." It's not him. It's not him? What, it's not him? It's not you? What, not me? But my lines!... But what lines? I'm bringing you your clothes. - Oh! Shut up! It's all your fault. Are you hurt? - It's your fault as well. You didn't do anything. - I couldn't. We're leaving for the hotel? Did you speak to her? - It wasn't possible. Is she sick? - In a bad way as regards her family. "Her family"? - Her family were killing her. Because of an enchanter, I think. What floor? That one, sir. 25F for the window pane. 50F for the table and 200F for renting my apartment. You, leave us in peace. This comedy is idiotic. Not as idiotic as this! We must find another way. Lise only had to find him. You are ungrateful. I did what I could. Which wasn't much. - Nice! Is she blaming us? - She should be reconciled with Marcel. You disgust me, all of you. You don't care about what I want. You would have made the mistress of that moron Marcel so that you could have your sponsor. No more sacrifices. I've had enough! You can take care of yourselves! You made me sell flowers in the middle of winter. What? Made me drink your Pernod 5 times a day. And you reward yourselves with I don't know what drugs. Will you shut up? As for you, you go out to satisfy your foul instincts. But you must be touched. She's gone crazy. We'll have you locked up! What a pitiful scene. Oh---... You're here? You shouldn't see me like this. My child, it's me, your father. It's me who... Oh, I don't know. The world hasn't changed much in the last 3000 years. Cinderella always has the most difficult parents. Picturesque. But enchanters can always appear when needs be. Lise. My carriage is downstairs. Come. Family, you may dispense with the reverence. I thank you. - Pardon, sir. Sir hasn't been injured? - No. Mademoiselle is coming with us? Does this bother you? - On the contrary, I didn't dare hope. To the hotel. - Very good, sir. He has a fancy car. - I'm going to take up flower selling on the pavements too. Here's 200F for the rent, 25F for the window, 50F for the table. It is peeling. You've been well paid. I accept. But you will also give me a stake in your con-trick. What con-trick? When the kid makes that guy, you'll give me something. What? For the thread, that's what. - What thread? The thread that will sow my mouth shut. And you know, what closes the mouth... Only the thread... The thread, the thread... The thread... Here is the end result of the magnificent direction of our friend. We get taken for gangsters. - It's a mere detail. The enchanter came. We have saved our theatre. Come in. This way. Sir hopes that Mademoiselle slept well. Sir will wait for Mademoiselle in half an hour for coffee. Thank you. Tell him I slept well and that I will be at his appointment. Sir? Mademoiselle? You never smile? Never when I'm in service. Out of principle? Out of training, mademoiselle. A word more, Constant. I won't do it anymore. You won't do what? I don't know, whatever it is that annoys you. That which is making me think that you hate me. Mademoiselle is mistaken. So why can't we be friends? I am sorry. My master can choose his friends from these particular milieux, but, given my status, I must aim a little higher. Everyone aims where they can. Ooh! A little more coffee? - No, thanks. I have my breakfast served here. You would have preferred the towers of Notre-Dame. I regret our fairy tale slightly. It is necessary sometime to leave the dream. You are no longer the enchanter. I am double. Everybody is the same. Ask who you like, at random. You'll see. You don't believe me? Let's see. Page! Sir? Do you sometimes dream that you are not a bellhop? Yes, sir. And what are you? - I am the prefect of police. You see that... The taste of power. Why prefect? To put the porter in prison. And why would you do that? He gave me a kick up the backside. This is for you. Thank you. - Thank you, sir. And you, Lise, when you are not a flower seller? Well, I'll tell you frankly. I'm an actress. Really? A great actress? Yes, a star. Strange idea. This I regret. I would be happier if you didn't have a double. I don't like to think of you as anything than very simple, natural, like you are. - Cinderella? Yes. Unfortunately, there is real life. - The car is going ahead with the luggage. Where shall I send the driver? Like always, hotel Majestic. - Very good, sir. Lise, listen carefully to me. Lise... I think I've found for your story an ending that will please you. Will you come with me? Yes, gladly. Come. It's beautiful, the Cote d'Azur, at this time of year? It's wonderful. The light is extraordinary. And the air has the scent of eucalyptus and mimosa. I have a surprise. Are you happy? That depends. Have you ever made a wish? - Yes. What? An example. To live three months without worry, in the sun, among the flowers. You'll have that pleasure, one day. - You think so? It's my most certain conviction. I have a confession to make to you. A surprise? The same for us both. Me first. - No but... Go on, go on. Let me tell you... - Shush. It would be better... - Shush. No, me first. Well, here it is... All this is yours. What are you saying? It's very simple. I'm offering you this shop and its contents. You are too kind. In the end, it's not much. Put yourself there. I feel a little foolish. Shut up. - Oh, pardon. Are you happy? Oh, very HAPPY-. The decor is very cheerful, isn't it? At the entrance, I'll put a jolly bell. It's charming. I have retained the delivery man. Ernest. Sir. Here is your new boss. - Madame. Ernest is resourceful. He'll be an excellent factotum. You've overlooked one thing. - What's that? My agreement. I really can't. I beg you. Don't cause me this trouble. It is the denouement of our adventure. Today, everything is changing, we are no more than tradesmen. That may be so. - Then you accept? I don't know if I can manage all this. I was used to my basket, my little bouquets. A shop is a big responsibility. No. Ernest will help you. Come on, be brave. - Brave? This will work out I have reserved for you an excellent customer. Ah yes? Who? Myself. When I come back, I'll place a big order. What kindness. It's late. I must be going. Goodbye. Good bye. And your surprise? Ah no, not today. When you return. As you wish. But I'll be some time. What's the matter? You seem sad. Oh, it's nothing. Just a little emotion. I am not yet used to all this. You soon will be. Could you manage a smile? Then I could leave content. Thank you. Hotel Ambassador? Yes, it's me again, mademoiselle. Yes, you are very friendly. What? Will I come and say hello one of these days? Certainly. As soon as... Ah! Mr. Philippe Martin arrives today? Very good. See you later, mademoiselle. And thank you again, eh. This is it. This is it, it's here. Oh, damn! He knows you all. At least, like the family. He doesn't know you. Take off your glasses. Let's see. Yes, the Greek type. Do you have a coat? - Yes. You want to earn 200F? - Oh... Lise? Here. Sign: Ernest. Lise? Lise! Sir? - Is Lise here? No, sir. - Has she gone out? She's not here anymore. She ceded the shop to me. She said that it was too much for her. I know what I owe to sir. I'll pay it back. I'll need 3 or 4 years. Do you know where Lise is? I haven't a clue, sir. Here... She received these cards, I don't know where to send them on. Would you do it? Certainly. Thank you. But you've changed the sign. Cinderella, it was jolly. Yes, but a little childish. While... It never changes. Hilarious. Oh! Oh, dear friend! Dear friend, what a nice surprise! In Paris? But I thought you were dead. Or very nearly. Dear friends, what a pleasant encounter. Mr. Philippe Martin, Mr. Papadilakos, Mr. Fuselard. Can you believe that it was Mr. Martin that discovered me? But it's you that will launch me. This dear Papa has just rented a theatre in Paris for my debut. And Mr. Fuselard is going to be our genial director. You seem a little taken aback at my transformation. Aren't you? Excuse me, dear madame, but I don't know you. Oh---... Ah yes. Yes, I know you. Yes. Last season, at the circus Medrano, in the lions' cage. You scared them, those poor lions... I told you. He's always joshing, this dear friend. Shall we see each other again? We're in the same hotel. See you soon. Come, Fuselard. Come on, Papa. To be blunt, he didn't even recognise you. I didn't like that circus story. He recognised me all right. The plan has worked admirably. I'll take the risk. Understand? Perfectly. - Goodbye. He seemed very angry. If he calls for me, it's double price: 400F. Goodbye. - See you later. Saved. Yes, it seems so. Your staging worked well. Everyone has his metier. It needs experience, and she's going to pull it off. We will have our sponsor, and I will have my little revenge. He will rejoin me in my room. It's impossible that he won't come. To see your makeup again? To find me again under my makeup. No point, Constant. We're leaving this evening. Hello? Mademoiselle? Prepare my bill. I'm leaving tonight at midnight. Porter, please. Porter. Hello? Mr. Martin will be here tomorrow? Ah no, Mr. Martin departs tonight, mademoiselle. Thank you. No trouble, mademoiselle. Shame. You here, dear? I'm here, dear. I didn't hear you knock. But I didn't knock. Why take this liberty, please? I'm catching the train tonight. I hope I'm not the reason. I absolutely had to see you. You have become a lady. I might even say, a very great lady. But decidedly, I was blind not to have preceived behind the mask of the violet seller the great actress that you are. - I did tell you. The florist's double is a star. You wouldn't believe me. You wanted to hold to your dream... Cinderella. Yes, you are right once again. But back to reality. Which one of those stuffed shirts is your lover? Well... this bothers you? How amusing. But which one? Guess. It's the fat one. He's the one who pays. The Papa of I don't know what. Papadilakos? No. - Then it's the other one, the director with the inspired ideas? You'll make me believe that they are paying for your hotel and you are disguised as a star. But really. It's ridiculous, isn't it? Even stupid, eh? It's grotesque. They would be doing the same as you. You had me disguised. Not as a star, that didn't amuse you. As a society lady. It amused you more. Not for very long. For a little soiree. And you bought me a small shop. I'm sick of flowers. A fool bought my violets, saw what I was and did what you would not do. Opened a career for me that allows me to deploy my talent. You don't see the role that you are trying to play? It is grotesque, ridiculous. A parakeet dressed up as a star. He has made you impossible, your Papa. Don't lecture me. Don't disgust me. This is the theatre? Is it you who will show me? - Yes, I'll show you! But first, I'm going to break his head, your Papa of I don't know what. What are you doing? By what right? The right of taking care of you. - Let go of me or I'll slap you. I'll get you. - But you'd do me wrong! Boor, boor, boor! - We can rediscover the rest. Let go of me! Let go of me! Cad! Let go fo me! Will you let go of me! What are you going to do? Help! Oh... - What happened? He washed my face. Mademoiselle is ready? - I could not check. Return the coffee and keep it warm until she comes down. Answer this, Constant. Something that we eat and also a subtraction, 7 letters. I see with pleasure that sir is in need of my illumination. A subtraction that we eat, 7 letters... I don't know, sir. I'm not in good form, this morning. But you are very well disposed. - Admirably. And why's that? I intend to bring you a shock. You're worrying me. A very small shock, sir. I'm catching the train at 10am. - You're going to Paris? No, I'm quitting sir. And why's this? I will explain to sir. I no longer feel at home. Where's that, Constant? At sir's. - Why? Mademoiselle has usurped some part of my functions. Your functions? - Yes. I had the privilege of exclusively making sir's coffee. I made the coffee. It was me who found the concerts that delighted Monsieur. I don't charm sir anymore. On crosswords, we often collaborated and happily, sir and I. We don't collaborate anymore. The few reasonable words and advice that I permit myself clash with contrary influences. Let's see... - No. I am not resentful. I will not mention to you how with one gesture of Mademoiselle it all starts. A gesture that deeply hurts my... my sense of propriety. In these circumstances, I regret to tell sir that it is all over between us. You are completely mad. Oh no, sir. Not mad, not mad! Pained... I am pained. Dear! Excuse me, I went to the vegetable garden. - But that's of no importance. Pardon me. I'm complicating your service. Don't do anything, mademoiselle. Sir will send my reference and the payment for this month to the address left on the bureau. Sir, mademoiselle. Carrot, sir! - What? Word of 7 letters signifying a subtraction, and that we eat. Ah yes, that's right. I forgot. Thank you. Oh, now, I will say no more, sir. But is he leaving? Yes. - Why? He is jealous. - Of me? Evidently. I didn't want to disorganise your life. He is a good boy. I'm going to talk to him. Constant! Yes, adverse circumstances... My God, my God... The little things, the coffee, the crosswords... Goodbye to all that. Constant... Oh, mademoiselle. I cannot believe sir. In my experience, sir never lies. You're leaving? - Yes. Excuse me. Oh... You're abandoning me, Constant. I am leaving sir so that he will be tete-a-tete with Mademoiselle. I'm lost. I don't understand. But you are my lightning rod. Why a lightning rod? You protect me. You spare me catastrophes. The little good manners that I have acquired, I owe to you. I was relying on you to know how to eat, to dress, to enter a salon... Without you, I'm doomed. "Lost". Thank you, Constant. Then you'll stay? Oh! - You'll stay? If I seem indispensable to you... - Indispensable. Indeed, you're correct. So, I'll stay. Thank you, Constant. Would you profit from my experience? Please. The gesture of Mademoiselle, there, flattered me greatly, touched me. But it is not the done thing that a mistress kisses her valet. In the theatre, the psychology of the characters determines the colour of the decor. For example, jealousy unexpressed out of modesty, well, a purple background, with little golden points. Obviously. We'll deliver the hangings. - Perfect, perfect. Make the little points rather large. And the bill? What am I supposed to do? - But, master... I'm creating, I'm creating. And when a man is creating, all is good. It deserves respect. And silence! What do you want? - It's about the bill. Make a cheque. - But... But what? It's what cheques are for. Everyone get ready to go again. You've got it, eh? Will you sign? A cheque, for the usual. Go... - But, sir. Go! Good”. Electricians, bring my projectors. Master, this cheque is for 18000F, and we have 11.50F. Ah, well? Oh... No... Really. A man like me worried by these details... Really, we should feel sorry for me. Hello? Hello, darling? What? Maison Coblin? A cheque? How much? I'm going to busy him. Am I disturbing you? Not at all. You look dazzling. You were working? No, no. Nothing urgent. You seem preoccupied. Not in the slightest. And what's with you? I feel embarrassed to ask you this but it's for the comrades. The hangings have been delivered. Fuselard has written a cheque, but it isn't covered. How much for? - 18000. I don't have it in French Francs. I have foreign currencies. You can change them. How can I thank you? - Like this. I pay this money to the account of the associates? Yes. And make it right away. We have already written the cheque. - Understood, mademoiselle. Mademoiselle. - Who are you? Police. You have changed currencies. - Yes. Why? You know very well. - By what right? You haven't understood. Police. You don't know that those notes are forgeries? Forgeries? It can't be! Come with us to Headquarters. - Your papers. My papers? Oh! I left my purse in there. I'm going to look for it. Ru get it. You should confess. It will go better for you. I don't know anything about it. As you wish. Your gang was in Cannes, just recently. Oh, my purse! Please, get a move on. They'll be coming. What's this all about? - They wanted to arrest me outside the bank. We're done. Serge! Sir? - No time for arguing. She was detained. - Shit! And the passports? Here. - 2 tickets for Marseilles. Okay. We should call from a public telephone. You're right. - Give me the rod. Here. - You never know. They were going to arrest you? They know you? What a joke! I am in clover. Am I not the enchanter? No. No more Philippe, no more Pierre. I'm prepared, completely ready, ready for anything... Raymond Berthier, who does not fear any police. Do you understand? Alas... No regrets. You have spoken well, I find this denouement very sad. It's not our choice, the circumstances decided. Between the great lords of trade and the captains of industry, the difference is slim, so slim. A simple engraving line erased. It is a trifle. And where am I in all this? You... It wasn't the number provided by the agency. This isn't at all what I expected. Say no more. That worked out! We're getting away once again. No point. She's gone. What's more, she'll never be back. Shame. What? I said shame. Shame. Explain yourself. I had a dream, for sir, another finale. Answering a pleasantry with a cruelty, it is unworthy. You're saying?... This ugly story hatched by sir could have only one result. Which is? One that lays bare the great heart of this person. She loves, sir. Her only dream was the salvation of sir. She is very superior to sir. That's all? - It's no small thing. I thank you, Constant. Pack the bags, we're leaving. - Very well. We never left. We made it into a play. Okay! Okay! It's for you that I'm worried. Counterfeit money, the judges won't mess around with that. It's not that. But I will demand to be heard, eh! I'll explain it all. - Mr Fuselard, someone's asking for you. Ah... Courage, my girl. Nicolas Fuselard, no doubt? - Yes. Edouard Coblin, the set designer. Ah... Delighted. It's about the cheque... - Yes, the cheque. Let me... It was explained that we do not take them. But knowing the worries you have... - Enormous. That's what I said to myself. An artist, a master, a thinker does not lower himself to these minutaie. So I cashed it, purely and simply. Cashed it? We've paid? It needs a slight retouching on the left, a dash of blue or of red. Paid, yes, and I hope that you are going to continue. Oh! You can count on it, sir. I'm so happy. It has been a pleasure to work with you. The director and the set designer are the bulwarks of the theatre. Ah! They cashed the cheque? The notes weren't fake? - Without batting an eyelid. But what they said to me! But the policemen, my arrest and the confession to him. It was to set you in motion. A farce and we trapped a big fish, in exchange for you who doesn't “kt our verses. But it all worked out, everything worked. We are safe, we can play. We play too much. You're here? I'm not leaving you again. I don't understand. No more stories. I know all about you. Fake notes, fake passports... I could call the police. You would be a good catch. But I don't... I don't fear you. No, I don't doubt it. You don't know who I am. At this point? Actress often, flower seller sometimes, but always... But always...? ...enemy of men and their fortune. You understand? Listen a little. This is it, my surprise. But I didn't dare, I thought you were an honest man, rich. And I have scrupules. Is this serious? You think I'm joking, when on a word from me, not even a word, a simple gesture... I just have to sound the alarm and you'll be leaving here in handcuffs. You were going to tell me your secrets... I'm getting there. Some tea, please. Very good, madame. I started off as a thief in rich hotels, that went well. It seemed like small fry and we gained little, despite the risks. So I preferred... - What did you prefer? Comedy. You really are an actress? - In life. The boards sometimes have an accident, a whim of honesty, an alibi. The rest of the time, I robbed. Then I came up with an idea. An idea? - Yes, that of joining with you. Oh no, never. But why not? We'd be unbeatable. - Yes. You'll get off at the next stop. Get off, it's a little strong. The tea is pale. Scams are everywhere. You'll get off at the next stop. Who do you take me for? That would be too easy. Sir told me to change his counterfeit notes and deserted me. You'll see, fake money merchant! Did you hear? - Yes. Fake money? Please excuse her. She's crazy. I am Philippe Martin, industrialist. Constant, my serviette. What's the point? We're done again, my poor Pierrot. We are accomplices, I confess. In the back. Pay attention! It's ridiculous. Look at my papers. - Shut up! Counterfeiters. In the 20th century! Telephone Paris. It'll take 3 minutes. I have 10 references : my agency, my bank, my solicitor... The commissioner will see. He will do what he has to do. Here's the money! It's not possible. Chief! Chief! Oh, the bastard! Counterfeit money in the 20th century. You still deny it? - That would take come nerve. But it's theatrical money. Mademoiselle is a comedienne. - Me? Not at all. Theatrical money? Everything's cardboard, in the theatre?... - Of course. Isn't it so, Constant? Don't push our luck, old pal. We made the engraving in Algeria. Constant! Lock them up. Go on. Oh! - Come on, Pierrot, calm down. What have you got, you? - Monsieur... Pierrot! Everyone has their turn. You will start. You weren't a good player. The fake notes were very heavy. It was disappointing. Yes, perhaps. I was wrong to try my hand at playing. I ask your forgiveness. But who are you? What I told you when we met. The king of a wonderful land. In my land, the summers are fresh, the winters are warm. It's like I told you. In substance, I wasn't lying. An enchanter. Almost. Explain yourself. Oh, it's very simple. Take it. Martin air-conditioners, "eternal springtime in your apartment!" It's ingenious. This is you? What do I know? Ah? No, I only know one thing. - What? That I love you. It's all a misunderstanding... Pardon. A joke that other passengers misunderstood. If Mr. Thiers was alive, he would say: "I am entirely of your opinion." Railways shake up the senses. We couldn't explain to that mob... The unleashed mob... The mob is difficult to manage. As Marshal MacMahon said: "There is the way. The way... The strong way!" Then, sir, it's very clear? Yes... No. Oh... - Shush! But... why did he confess, this one here? A fantasy, a misunderstanding, springtime. Springtime, the birds... You must have been drinking. - Ah no. This does not satisfy me! There! You explain it! Sir... - Is there any point? But I have to make a report. A report. Sir, I am at the end. This life weighs me down. What? The situation is becoming too difficult. My nerves are weakening, my health is fraying. I'd rather be in prison. I give up. Philippe! - Sir! I beg you. Don't exhaust yourself. You will get extenuating circumstances. I was a bad genie. Don't you have any regard for me? I'm far from thinking that. You can boast that you captured Bob the Strangler. Bob the Strangler? Who's that? Yes, and his accomplice. Sylvain Darval. - But, sir... And their partner in crime, Anita the Redhead. Oh, Philippe! He's gone mad. No. We are equal. Ah, that's what it is. You see? Non, but I'm getting there. I'm not far off. Show your papers. - For what reason? And if I fancy again one night to be Bob the Strangler? Weren't we happy in the cell? Prison is the truth. - Oh, sir... Commissioner... It is fortunate that I remain, despite a difficult job, young in temperament and sprit. Although a northern man, I love tall stories, and I laugh. And I laugh at seeing the disarray of our constabulary. Because I recognised you, Mr. Martin. Ah? - But yes. I've already had dealings with you as an inspector. Oh... - Oh no. About theft in your factory at Saint-Ouen. Ah... Oh yes. - Mr. Poiloche. Mr Martin! I am angry. You didn't recognise the inspector. Ah, that's not nice. But... I forgive you for it. Mr. Martin... you're free. - Too bad. Too good. - We will never know the truth. Someone will remain in jail. Mr. Martin. I have your guarantee on the morals of Mademoiselle and Sir ? Mademoiselle, yes. Sir is unknown to me.
