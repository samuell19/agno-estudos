Sorry, but do you have an appointment with Dr. Martini? I have not. Give him this letter. You will see that he will await me immediately. OK. Wait here. Please, come on. My partner Micheli writes me that you have something very important to tell me. Sit down and let me know. Thanks. You see, Mr. Martini... I came to talk to you about a project... which Mr. Micheli cares about. Hi? Do you hear me? Martini? Martini? Do you hear me ? Goodbye, Sir. Goodbye. I did not understand that they contacted a foreigner. We could have made that money instead of that Bedouin. I already told you, it was Micheli who organized everything. He did this because it is less dangerous. According to him, he takes fewer risks. Look, he's coming out. Well, he's in no hurry. For me he either screwed it up or he really is a specialist. I could be wrong, but something went wrong, I can feel it. But in your opinion it was the only possible solution. If he gets caught, they'll probably make him talk. And you know what to expect. But what are you worried about? It was me who contacted the American, not you. You don't even know him. And he doesn't know that you exist. And in an hour he'll be flying to the United States. You're always too sure. I, on the other hand, think something... didn't work as planned. Otherwise he would have called us already. Relax yourself! Martini must die. But it should be a clean job. You know me well to know that I leave nothing to chance. Once your mission is completed, you will get this document. What if I refuse? I left Vietnam not to kill. And since then you've been considered a deserter. Not to mention the slip you made in Italy. Which you plead innocent of, but... But which allows you to blackmail me. You can think what you want, but I'm trying to get you out of trouble. Listen... You accept my offer and start a new life... Far away from here. Under a false name and with money. Or you don't accept and already know the other solution. You are a big bastard! It would be better for everyone. You might even return to the United States. You can do anything with money. Think about it. The gun. Now Micheli's letter for Martini, which you took with you. Very good. Now it's my turn to give you something. The letter of credit for the American bank. With a bunch of money for you. Do you trust us? You don't control? The plane ticket and your passport. Really good fake. Nearly perfect. Something is missing. Ah, you remember that. Wise precaution. The fire leaves no trace. Especially if the police finds it... Nobody could save you from thirty years in prison. The envelope had to be sealed. In fact, it isn't. What harm can it do to you? Now you are clean. I told you not to read other people's mail. They had you nailed for sure, right? A real champion. Hurry up! The police! Speed up! But you're crazy! Are these gentlemen going to the airport? Yes. Please take the lady with you. Her car is broken. She's a stewardess and should be on the plane by now. We cannot accompany her. Come miss. Hurry up. Thank you and remember to have the car towed to a garage. We take care of this. Do not worry. Good Trip. Thanks. I apologize gentlemen. But I have to do my shift, which starts in an hour. Do not worry. We're almost there. Come on, faster! Bon voyage, sir. Thanks. Excuse me Miss, the plane to New York? Exit 25, Sir, downstairs. Are you afraid, ma'am? I'm traveling for the first time... Everything okay. He just passed control. Hello? It is finished! Martini is liquidated, the American is on the plane to New York. Very good. Bravo. You see it is as I prophesied. The martini case is closed. It was easy. You can breathe now. But I was always calm. But that idiot Martini, who wanted to testify at all costs... ...before the commission of inquiry. Dangerous witnesses must be eliminated. Especially when it comes to interests that justify an approach that is brutal. That's how it is. They must be eliminated. Power must be defended. Yes. What? Did you call the police? No. I can not believe it. We'll be right there. That was Martini's secretary. She just discovered the body. Tell the commissioner I'm going to the airport. There's a dead man on board. Good marshal. Please come on. Please gentlemen. The departure is delayed a bit. Please gentlemen. To the bus. Unfortunately nothing could be done. He is dead. The poor. It was his first flight. You must wait for the doctor's order to leave. Quite a blow! It happens sometimes. Nearly perfect. Almost perfect. Nearly perfect. Nearly perfect. Fake very well. Nearly perfect. Nearly perfect. Nearly perfect. It's a heart attack. The plane can take off. No more passenger data. Really good fake. Nearly perfect. Nearly perfect. Nearly perfect. Nearly perfect. Nearly perfect. The autopsy should not be necessary. But the doctor decides. Good. The list is ready. Gentlemen, your passports. The plane takes off. Thanks. Mr. Jacobson? Mr. Jacobson? Mr. Jacobson? Motherfucker! What do you do? My car... My car... Thief! Thief! Is there no police here?! There is a gentleman who would like to speak to you. OK. I'll be right back girls. Did you decide? When do we leave? Only next week. When he repaired the yacht. Oh, I can't wait. What are you doing here ? The plane was blocked. There was a check. I got scared and ran away. My passport remained in the hands of the police. So you're screwed. We have a problem. Do you really believe? You want to draw me into this story. It's easier for them to believe my word than yours. It does not matter. It does not matter. I will try to help you again as I always have. Yes. By forcing me to become an assassin. For the rich, like you, who have money, anything goes. Not true? Bravo. You see, in the sea the little fish do what the big fish say. In the air, it is the birds of prey, the eagles, that command. And on earth there are us, the Michel is. Listen... I gave you a bunch of money... And a nice brand new passport. Thanks to me, that past that got you down no longer exists. What do you want from me now? The pact was clear, wasn't it? But it was me who risked everything for you! Because you couldn't expose me. If I had killed a man today... It was you who shot. OK. I want to help you this time too. You will get a new passport. On behalf of... let's see... Albert Morgan of Philadelphia. And tomorrow you will have a new letter of credit. Once you have your passport ready, you are ready to depart. Don't you like that too? The police know me. I need to change my face. I'm staying in this house until I can go. Exactly here? But why? You are crazy?! How come? Where could I go? Good. I will be your friend until the end. OK. You stay here. I'll call Ramparo about the passport. What do you do ? So stupid! Get out of here! I've already said it: He was a tall man with long brown hair. And with a mustache. He wore sunglasses. I would say foreigner. Could it be that one? If not this one then he looks a lot like him. What time did he come? At noon, because the sirens wailed at the turn change. When did you discover the body? When I came back from the canteen. Around three o'clock. Do you know if Monsieur Martini had any enemies... ...or whether he had received threatening phone calls or letters? As far as I know: no. No, absolutely not. We took care of him. Unless it's a political reason. You know how times change. Do you know a certain Jeff Jacobson? Never heard. Who is this? This man. No, never seen him. And you, Mr. Calvi? Also never seen? I can't say... But I would say no. How can you say no? Either you've seen him or you've never seen him. No I'm sure I've never seen him before. Thanks. If I still need you... We're here. Can you tell me what got into you? If anyone has ever seen him, it's you and... you look like you've met him before. Put yourself in my shoes. A commissioner arrives here, He gives us a name, shows us a picture, and you want me to keep quiet? But the man in the photo is the one who eliminated him... That's him! Basically there is no need to worry. Anyway, he's already gone. No, he couldn't leave. What? Didn't he leave? But then we're in trouble. Not yet. They won't find him, you'll see. Yes? Mr. Micheli, Engineer Robinson has arrived. Send him up. Go now, I'm busy. And try to control you, because the interrogations are not over yet. A job that is quite successful, I would say. Well, one last small change. Still, perfect. Look at you. Look at you. You could be mistaken for a notary public or, even better, a doctor. Or almost for a priest. All right, don't get mad. Let's stay professional. It is really incredible. Now you really are Albert Morgan from Philadelphia. Let's see the jacket. Try it. Good. Very good. Here is the new letter of credit. As for the passport, I have to go to Ramparo today. Come on, let's toast on Albert Morgan's fortune. Are you interested in a well paid business? Sure.That is why we are here. The American didn't fly. But yeah, we saw him take the plane. He's here in town. And therefore he must be eliminated. We don't know where he's hiding. And then comes the immediate danger of Micheli. Mister Micheli? Mister Micheli? Yes. The police noticed the American. And she's looking for him. If she finds him, they can easily trace back to Micheli. And from him to me. That's why you step onto the dance floor. Once Micheli is eliminated, the chain will break. I don't want to take this the wrong way, but your idea would be... Yes. Kill Micheli. Good Mr Calvi. Micheli and the American are bullshit. He wants to be the boss. So what? As long as things go well for us. No, this is not possible. And yet this man must go. Getting a fake passport is not that easy anymore. Today there are other methods... to get rid of someone who bothers you. If you want I can take care of it. No I want this man gone. Do what you want. But I don't want to set foot there again. There were already enough problems with this American... A mistake that can drown us all. Let me out of this story. I don't want to deal with it anymore. Not even to help an old friend? No longer. An old friend who has known you for a very, very long time. How do you mean? You got it. Son of a bitch. All right, but next time... There won't be a next time. To the health of a woman of great class. You will soon have your new passport. Just enough time to give Ramparo a million. And the ticket? You will have that tomorrow too. Now go home. And don't move from your room. See you later. Are you sure you killed him? I emptied an entire magazine. Do you think I didn't liquidate him? Did you kill the other one too? No, I do not think so. And then Calvi only pays us for one dead man. Yes. But who was with Micheli? What do I know? Maybe the servant? But no, the servant is older. What do we do? Shall we go back? No no. Keep driving. Let's wait a bit and see if anything happens. OK. There's the car. But there is also Micheli! So he's not dead. But where are they going? Let's follow them! He must be like us. His work is too clean. And he doesn't like ads. But damn, its him! The American! He's not stupid. He will make Micheli's body disappear to avoid trouble. But now we're the ones in trouble. He must have recognized you. He must be eliminated. Leave it! That's too far away. Better we call Calvi first. He has changed. It's difficult to spot him. We must keep following him. But be careful, he might be armed. Hello Mr. Calvi? Here the left-hander. All done. But the American hid the body. Yes, I think he recognized us. It's like I thought. Yes, it's good. OK. Excuse me, Mr. Ramparo? Mr. Ramparo? Yes, Mr. Ramparo. He is not here at the moment. If you want to wait for him at the bar. Thanks. You are welcome. It's the one served by the bartender. Excuse me, are you looking for Mr. Ramparo? Yes. Would you tell me what you want from him? No, I have to speak to him personally, Micheli sent me. The telephone. Yes? Micheli sends him. Bring him here. Come with me. Thanks. Ah, you are Mr. Ramparo. I thought you were a man. Come here. Who are you? Micheli sent me. Please sit down. My name is Albert Morgan. I'm here for the passport. I was expecting Monsieur Micheli. Well, Mr. Micheli is unexpectedly unable to come for business reasons. Besides, I'm the real prospect. It's weird that he didn't call me. Do you have the money? A million Mr. Morgan. And the passport? In five days. But why in five days? I need it immediately. Then go to Ponza to a man who calls himself Cracker... He already has your details. The cracker. And where can I find him? In Ponza. Go to the port and ask for the Firecracker. He will then get in touch with you. In Ponza. But I don't even know where that is. Then wait for Mr. Micheli's return. Where does this bus go? Don't you know? Rose del mare is the terminal. Damn! Look at that! What a bastard! Hey, but you can't come in! Excuse me, but I have to make a phone call. It's urgent. Be quick. We were about to close. I leave it here. He's coming to pick it up in the morning. Yes, thank you, that's fine. I'm done. Can I go? Sure. Close the gate good. Good night, madam. Good night. Good night. See you tomorrow. We have to squeeze here. Yes. That's better. Turn around. No it's easy here. Just lift it up a bit. That's enough for tonight. You are welcome. Sorry but I have to close now. I said you have to go now. Are you afraid of them? Yes. Are you from the police? The police would have already taken action. What do they want from you? They want to kill me. Kill you? But then call the police. I can not. Well I'm going now my love, please get out of here. OK. Come. There must be another exit. Come on, let's take a look! Here we are on the other side. Well what are you waiting for? I have no documents and I don't know anyone. Wait. Get in my car. The block is full of entrance doors. This scoundrel tricked us. Do you like it here? I need help. Do not leave me alone. Let me in first. Why? What's happening? No one. Ah, it was for your business. You know I don't pay attention. Me, yes. You live alone ? Can't you see that? And yet you don't convince me. But what are you afraid of? If I wanted to betray you, I would have already done so. If anyone should be afraid here, it's me. Why did you bring me here? I ask myself the same thing. I do not understand you. And I don't like what I don't understand. Maybe there is a motive why I did it. Maybe because we have something in common. That is? We're alone, both of us. Alone here. Do you want to eat something? I'm sorry but I rarely cook. Want some beer? There's something in the fridge. Thanks. I prefer milk. Do you know what I miss in this house? What? A Cat. Or a dog. And why not a bastard. But that's just how you are. You mean an old maid? No. You understood me perfectly. I'm the dog, the bastard. You found me and adopted me. You could be right and I could be wrong. But you didn't understand anything! Anyway... Thanks for helping me. What is your name ? Isabelle. Good night Isabelle. Good night. Commissioner, you must protect me. My life is in danger. It's the Red Brigades. The Red Brigades? Try to calm down. Sit down and tell. But what is there to not understand? He kills first Mauro Martini, then Roberto Micheli, we were three partners, now it's my turn! I beg your pardon? Micheli was killed? Killed, kidnapped... Anyway, he's been missing since last night. One moment, one moment. You said he was killed. How do you know? Try to think. He didn't come home last night, he stayed out all night. And Martini didn't go to the factory as usual. How do you explain that? There are different explanations. A last minute request, a date with a woman... Excuse me, but I know that Mr. Micheli... You think what you want! But I warned you. But if anything happens to me, you're responsible. Marshal Pane. Where do you want to go? To my business. Why in the store? You won't come into the store. You come with me. We are in a hurry. Do you want me to come with you? What do you mean? Where do you want to go? No, sorry, but that's not possible. But don't you understand, it's not because of me, they're gonna hurt you? But who should hurt me? Those who follow me. But what do they want from me? They want to know where I am. They think you know me well. Anyway, until I go, you have to hide, got it? There after? Then there is no more danger. They're after me. Let's go. But where are we going? To Ponza. To Ponza? But why? Isabelle, as long as you're with me, there's no risk. At least let me call the store. Later. They could attack us at any moment. Let's go, Isabelle. You're not from Rome, are you? No I'm not Italian, I'm French, from Nantes. Nancy, the city of sardines. No, it's Nantes. Oh yeah... So tell me about Nantes. There isn't much to tell. My parents left me when I was ten years old. The only thing I remember is a small square where an old lady was selling crepes in front of the school. Crepes? Yes, pancakes. These are “firms“. And you? Where do you come from? I'm American. American? You speak Italian well. Tell me your story. Have you been here for years? How long have you lived in Italy? I was born in Denver, Colorado. But I have few memories of my city. Do you want to go back there? Yes but who knows? I would like to. But it seems so far away. But why do you want to go to Ponza? To get this passport that will allow me to return to my country. Can we talk about something else? If you want. Do you have siblings? A sister who is older. She is wonderful. But I haven't seen her in years. She lives in Central Australia. Well, what luck! Not really, at least until today. After several odd jobs, she just made a fortune. She now has a panda breed. What? Pandas, these little bears, they give to children in this country. Never seen. It's hard to forget a face like his. I am sure. Who was the American who came to your house last night? No. No American came to me. Let her in. She said you had a stranger as a guest last night, sent by Micheli. So what? First of all, he wasn't. Then I don't know if he was a foreigner. Thirdly, he came to tell me that Micheli cannot come. Mr Micheli can confirm this for you. Mister Micheli, right? We are currently looking for him. I don't mean to be indiscreet, but why do they want to kill you? To extricate myself from a dirty blackmail where I compromised myself. That's why I can't contact the police. They are looking for me. The document that linked me to this man... and that compromised me is now in my hands. Meanwhile, the man was killed. And the next one is me. You say you've been compromised in a sordid story, but to what extent? It is none of your business. I'm sorry. Besides, it's in the past now. Let's not talk about this anymore, please. OK. It's strange that a woman like you should be so lonely. Do you remember the story of the old lady... who sold pancakes in front of school? Do you know why I remember this? Because I never tried their pancakes, I couldn't afford them. And since then I still have this unknown taste in my mouth. It sure doesn't matter much. But it was a great experience. In this age... I've worked my whole life to survive and live well. One day I realized it was too late. The crepes didn't have the taste I had imagined. And so I went on alone. And I'm getting more and more tired. Speaking of crepes... I couldn't afford them either. But I tasted them. If you knew how many I ate. Even if they were different than yours. But they weren't enough for me. And I was looking for something different. And I wanted something different and something different again. And if I couldn't have something, I took it by force. With violence. And in the end I was left alone. Alone as you. If anyone is looking for me, it's only to kill me. I look like them. As? Like the gulls. They are looking for something to eat. Every day they fight over the garbage they find in the sea. There is an old French song that says: Don't kill seagulls. Yes, don't kill seagulls. As to say, do not hurt the weak. It's always them, the untouchables, the powerful, the eagles, the birds of prey, that shape our lives. Wait for me here. Please, a carpano. Immediately madam. Excuse me, do you know the Cracker? Do you know the Cracker? May I know where you want to go? I called the store. Did you forget that I have a job? Why are we running so fast? Sorry but we are in a hurry. Come. How sweet. Will you sell it to me? Yes Madam. Here. Is that OK? Thanks. Look how beautiful he is. I'm calling you...but I don't even know your name. Is that important ? Why, surely. How should I call you? "Hey you"? Hey you! You got lucky this time. But try not to be seen doing it. I tell them again that they are making a big mistake. I want to speak to the Commissioner and I want to contact my lawyer. Commissioner. Here is the lady. She is tough. But what a woman. So you confirm the version you told me. I repeat to you for the umpteenth time that I do not know this man. He just came to tell me Micheli can't come. That's all. What time was it? Half past eight. Or seven thirty if you prefer. So you admit that this man was the last person to see Micheli alive. What do you mean by that? That Micheli was killed between seven and eight in the evening. We found the body. Killed? Murdered. To inform you about this, this man has come to your home. You are joking. How am I to understand that? Yes, I could charge you with aiding and abetting murder. What do you think? My answer is... I will say no more except in the presence of my attorney. Get rid of those lawyers. You can go for now. I bid you farewell, Inspector. sorry goodbye. Is it working? Everything is fine, Commissar. Why aren't you eating? I'm not hungry. Isabelle, I can't go. And maybe I'll never come back. But why are you talking like that now? You didn't kill anyone. Everything will be fine. You must have faith. I remember playing an awful game in Denver when I was a kid. I tried dropping ink drops... for insects running fast across the floor tiles. And they ran, ran... Gone crazy. Side by side. They would have liked to know how to fly to escape. Today I am like these insects. And one day... A drop will hit me. Denver... A house. Honest work. Isabelle, I will never succeed. On the contrary, you will succeed. You'll make it, I'm sure. Sir. I found the number you asked for. Oh yes, thank you. Excuse me. And again, stay there so he can contact you. Sooner or later he will get in touch with you. And don't be so stupid as to call me. But I... Miss, if you're looking for your husband, he just walked out. Went out? He had just spoken on the phone. A man came and they walked together. And again, stay there so he can contact you. Sooner or later he will get in touch with you. And don't be so stupid as to call me. Understand? But I... Pane! Find out immediately where that call came from. We're working on it. It's a local call. We still need time. Go on! Deploy two agents to monitor Mr. Calvi's house. And that they don't let it out of their sight. He really could be in danger. OK. And have his office monitored too. Once you know the origin of the call, contact the local official and transfer it to me. Okay Sir. This is irrefutable evidence. The gun that killed Micheli is the same that killed Martini. It's a 765 with a silencer. As I suspected. Same gun and certainly the same man. Perfect Mr Albert Morgan. Thank you sir. Call me cracker, everyone here calls me that. You know I smoke a lot. It gives me energy. A bit like my old clocks. 300,000 Iiras. But I've already paid a million. That was for the passport. This is for me now. Dirty criminal. Dirty American bastard! You will pay for this! Search him! Dirty coward! I paid myself. Now you can pay them too. What happened to you ? Who did this to you? Who made the pass. They wanted more money. And the passport? No, they left that to me. Isn't that what you wanted? Yes but... The money is not a problem. So you can leave in peace. This is how you are: wonderful. Maybe because I care about you. You care about me now. But when we met I was a stranger. And yet you turned to me, you took risks, Nobody had done it before. The world is a mess and I learned it that way. I'm not the world, I'm Isabelle. Maybe we can't have a love story like the others. We wasted too much time. But one thing remains for us, to be ourselves. As we are now. I need you tonight. And when you want... I can give you what makes you happy. The past doesn't matter anymore. Thank you Mr Albert Morgan. Who? Albert Morgan. According to the passport. I now know what to call you. We have time for everything. I checked the departure times of the planes. We are driving home, we'll get some money and the ticket and then... I just have to accompany you to the airport. But when are you coming to me? When I've settled my affairs. Come quickly! I need you. At the moment I don't think that's possible. So as soon as you can. I promise you, but I don't think I can leave right away. No, but tomorrow! The door is open. How is that possible? They were probably thieves. No. They didn't take anything with them. It was them! They keep looking for me. The damned! Let's go! Unfortunately we arrived too late, Commissioner. They left this morning. Damned! But wait a minute. Why did "they" leave? How many was it? The American and a woman. A certain Isabelle... Isabelle Michereau. The porter said it was his wife. According to the hotel register... The woman gave as her registered place of residence... Salerno square number 6. Isabella Micheau. Salerno square number 6. Very good thank you. Forward immediately. OK, Commissioner. Let's go. Hello? Hold on. They are there. What do we do? Go to the store. They won't harm you. They want me. What will you do? I will continue by car and leave it at the airport. Chill out. They won't get me. Call me from the airport. Go now! Quietly and without looking back. Isabelle! It's him. Follow him! What do you want? Go away asshole!!! Kiss my ass! Old chump! Go ahead, go! Where is he? Fiumicino! But of course he's going to the airport! Drive back. Hello Isabelle? Albert, are you okay? Yes, yes everything is fine. Listen Isabelle... I... I love you! I love you Isabelle! I understand now that you cannot live alone. It's wonderful to be able to tell you that. You won't be alone anymore. I will always be close to you. I'm out of time. But I have to tell you something... I didn't have the courage to tell you. What? Isabelle, I... killed a man. I killed to free myself from a trap meant to kill me. I had to tell you. Do you understand? Oh my god, why did I meet you so late? But believe me, Isabelle, I'm paying for what I've done. It's terrible but I'll pay for it! And I'm willing to pay for it if you... No no. Please do not cry. Don't cry, otherwise I won't be able to explain it to you anymore, talk to me. Before I go... I need to know if... if you can forgive me and believe me? Love me anyway? If not, I understand too Isabelle. I will understand. Isabelle! Isabelle! Isabelle! Answer me please! Isabelle! Isabelle! Now they can't do anything to him. He is gone. He is gone! Hi? Yes... This is for you, Commissioner. It's from the airport. Hi. He is safe! He is safe! He is safe! Subtitles by Cineploit 2022
