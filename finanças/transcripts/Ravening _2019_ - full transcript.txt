Excuse me! The clinic's shut today. Sister, my friend's having an emergency. Can you take a look at him? But, I'm a pediatrician. You should take him to the hospital. Its not far. He's in a bad state. Please have a look at him. His house is in the next lane. Brother, today is her off day. Listen. Piku is upstairs. I'll back in a bit. Thank you so much. You totally saved the day. So what exactly happened to your friend? He is overeaten I think. He is turned green. He is been puking for the past 2 hours. Also shitting. Perfect. Just what I needed on a Sunday morning. Right, right... - Whose house is this? - My friend, Rajesh's. What did he eat? Actually, he's a vegetarian. His parents are out of town. So he wanted to eat meat for the first time. He liked it so much that he overate, and now... - You ate the same meat? - Yes, Sister. Where? Some dirty place I guess.... Not at all. We cooked it ourselves. The rest of us are fine. I think his system couldn't take it. Sister, help me. Please save me! Age? 27. - Can you make ORS? - Yes. Don't worry. Its just indigestion. I've given medicines, you'll be fine soon. And next time, go easy on the meat. I won't even utter the word meat’ again! Meat isn't the problem. Gluttony is. Why did you feed so much meat to a vegetarian? Actually it was his idea. He also paid for the goat. You mean the mutton? No I mean a whole goat! We don’t buy dressed meat in the "Meat Club”. - "Meat Club...?" - A meat eaters' club. Not really a club. But a union of like minded students at the University... These days people put anything in their mouths. Not knowing where the meat came from... How was it stored, how old is it... Feels sick just thinking about it. But in our Meat Club... ...we buy the thing live, slaughter, cook and enjoy it. Hey! My house... Sorry Sister, for going on and on. No its fine. I like your idea. Meat Club! Thank you. Eh... your fees...? Doesn't matter! I barely did anything. Something...? Okay so tell me... ...this meat you cook in your club... ...does it taste any different? It tastes like meat. Alright. Just bring me some meat next time you cook. - Then we'll be even. - Good idea. But I hope your palate's adventurous. We don't exactly cook broiler. As long as you don't feed me dung beetles. Elias bro! Where the hell were you? Don't ask. Have we lost? Not yet! Elias bro! I'll take the final shot. No. I'll take it. Come on, Elias bro! Elias bro! Come on! Come on, Elias bro! You can do it! - Want to hear a joke? - Hmm. So this guy goes to church to confess. He says, "Father, I have sinned. ....I've had sex with my patient." The Priest says, "It's ok my son... "Sometimes it happens between doctors and patients." But then the man says, "Father, but I’m a vet!" Seems there's no work at your clinic... You're on WhatsApp, Facebook all day, hm? Picking fleas off the dogs of the rich doesn't take hours. Talk about hating your job. Forget it. Tell me more about this Rajesh episode. Nothing much beyond what I said already. Damned fool almost died in his lust for meat. But... The doctor was such a nice person. Guys these days... ...they're all unfit. Lazy, flabby, no discipline... Eddie’s not like that. He's so fit. Hard in the right places, soft where he should be. It's all fun till you get caught. Who's going to tell? You? Let me get some chicken. Its so nice to drive at night in Guwahati, no? Do you remember that time? When we drove from Maligaon to Noonmati... ...in under 15 minutes? Nobody drives faster than Dilip. Remember how Rakesh kept yelling like a baby? "Dilip...! Slow down! Slow down, please...!" Its been so long since we all hung out. True. Next time, whenever Dilip's in town. Where's Dilip da? When's he back? God knows. In the field his phone just doesn't work. He'll pop up without warning one of these days. Bye! Text when you reach home. Hey listen. Tomorrow we're watching a play. At four. Play? If someone asks, lady. Uh. Oh? Okay. But Jumi, I don't like all this. It's all under control. Just play your part. Bye! Screw the meeting. Come with me. No, Elias bro. I have to go. Just drop me at Jalukbari. You guys just had a feast. This will be more fun. - It's a tea estate. - What'll I do there? The plantation has rabbit pestilence problem. They've caught a whole bunch of wild rabbits. And they want me to neuter them. Fees apart, he's promised me a rabbit lunch. Wow! Why didn't you tell me before? So you'll come? Am I not already! - Is Sister in? - Do you have an appointment? No. I've got something for her, actually. Oh. Its you! - All well? - Yes... I'm good. How's your friend? He got better the same day. Okay What's that? Your fees. Ooh! Meat Club food? You didn't have to! - It's rabbit meat. - Rabbit? I've never had it before. I have. It’s very tasty. Let's see what it looks like. - Bora brother. - Sister? Can you ask Mina, to bring some plates? Okay... Do you like it? Umm... its so soft. Its not like mutton at all. These are wild-rabbits. We got them from a tea garden. Did you cook it yourself? That's the basic rule of the Meat Club. Meat's eaten best with your fingers. I know. But I've this mental block. I can't eat with my hands. Scared of infection right? You get it. Usually people think I'm being pretentious. You and pretentious! There’s not one pretentious bone in your body. What did you study at the University? I’m a research scholar at the Dept of Anthropology. I've just started my PhD. ...on meat eating traditions in the North East. And Meat Club...? Part of your research? No. That's just a passion. But who has the time to buy fresh meat? And we can't possibly go to restaurants... ...to see where the meat came from. ....how it was kept, cooked. We have hectic lives. There're many places that serve REAL meat. But you'll never go to those. What? Why? You know, they are not exactly posh. What do you take me for? If the place is clean and the food is good... ...I'll go anywhere. "Sister, Sumon here. Please save my number." Hey what's up? You've been distracted all evening. Nothing like that. How was the rabbit meal with the doctor? Nice... She's so wonderful. If I'm not wrong, she's also someone's wife. Oh come on! It's not like that! Hello Sumon. I will save it. Hello Sumon. Do you remember? It was a night just like this. When we first... Yeah...yeah. Let's get out of here. You, me... ...and my new car. Thanks again for the rabbit meat. Sure. Just a minute. No problem! It was my pleasure. Are you at home or at work? At home. Having dinner. What's for dinner? Meat :) When I was ten... ...my father gave me a rooster. He said, "Its yours. Take care of it." It was so beautiful. He had a regal red crown and brilliant colourful plumage... For a month... I took care of it. Then, my father asked me to cut it up... ...for dinner. And you ate it? Didn't you feel bad? Yes. But I also felt hungry. How's the food? I've never had any meat cooked with banana blossom before. Squab is fattier than chicken. So it goes very well with protein rich vegetables. Next time let's try catfish with colocasia. Next time? No way! If I keep eating like this I'll turn into a football. You'll stay healthier, actually. Want something else? Where to Sister? Hospital. After dropping him off. Ok... Sister...have you heard of Gondhipuk? Gondhipuk? The bug that stinks a lot? Yes, some people eat it, raw. - Raw...? - Yes. They pick it up, squeeze out the fluids from its body... ...and pop it in their mouths. Wow. In some parts, they eat anything. That's not the crazy part though. Squeezing out the fluids from the bug is important. Like how you need to de-vein a shrimp. If you don't... ...else it poisons you. Yeah. The Gondhipuk fluid isn't poisonous... ...but you go on a trip. An amazing trip! You just want to hide inside a hole. That too for about 48 hours. For about 48 hours. Come on. That's a tall tale. I swear! My friend from there says, "Come to my village... You'll see people under blankets, inside baskets, in wells... And if you ask why they say... 'Fool drank the bug's piss'. So I sometimes wonder... Is Gondhipuk... ...food or is it a hallucinogen? An optimum amalgamation of food and hallucinogen. So tell me...? - No ma'am...actually... - What 'actually?' I mean. You’ve got such a great chance. You've worked so hard. Now you say you won’t go? - Yes ma'am... - Yes ma'am? How many Phd students get such a chance in their first year? What's wrong with you? No Ma'am... I have an issue. 'Issue?' What issue? Is something wrong at home? No ma'am. Just...an issue. Ok... I get it... You won't get very far. I've seen too many research scholars likefy you. You are such a sincere student... Yes ma'am. Your thesis will be really special. If only you could have been my Guide. Hope you didn't mind. I was just kidding. Why will I mind? I like talking to you. Today Piku scored an A+ in Math! Look how thrilled he is. Fresh fish by the river tomorrow. You'll have to use your hands. Never seen anyone pick fish with a fork and spoon before today! It was awesome. Looks like you're doing your PhD only to eat meat! Well done! Two birds with one stone. When I eat out with you... I feel like eating only the meat. The rest of it doesn't even register. How strange! I'm so glad to be of value in your life. And I can say the same for you. - Is Sister in? - She's nursing a headache. Yesterday was too stressful for her. Oh hi. Hey. What's up with you? You have to tell me. Right now! Nothing, I have a migraine. You take forever to return my texts. Our phone calls are shorter. You don't hang out with me anymore. What’s up with you? Have I done something? Its not you, Jumi. Does it even occur to you, I could have my own plans? What? You're having an affair! Are you crazy? Can I just sleep? Ah ha! Now it all makes sense. What nonsense. Ok... Just tell me his name. Its nothing like that. I'm not you, okay? Yes, you're not me. For I would never judge you for having an affair. Fine, I guess I'll go then. There's this one guy. I hang out with him. He takes me to places... ...where they serve unusual meat dishes. Did you know... ...you can cook catfish with colacasia? Catfish? Colacas? Is this an affair or a food show? Will you stop saying that? Okay okay. Carry on... There nothing else. That's it. Oh really? I think... ...he's developing feelings for me. And you? Come on! I’m so much older than him. Married. I have a kid. That doesn't answer my question. It doesn't matter, how I feel. It’s wrong. Ok, then stop meeting him for a while. He'll get the hint. You’re right. I'm going to put a stop to this. Tea? I’ve never laughed so hard in my life! My stomach hurts! There's only one cure for that. Meat! Not tonight. Dilip's coming tomorrow. I should go back. Get the house in order. Yeah. Actually, I should go too. Have lots of work pending. What? Why didn't you tell me before? You shouldn't have come tonight. True. What’s the point in all of this...? Dilip! How...? You said you're arriving tomorrow morning! All these years and you still can't predict me. I love it! You should've called. Have you had dinner? Waiting for you. I've got some yam straight from the fields. Mina is cooking it right now. I missed you, Niri. Just a minute. Didn't you eat well? No... Just felt like eating some meat. We faced a big wave of Japanese Encephalitis in Merapani. It's amazing how quickly diseases spread in remote areas. Actually one would think it would be the opposite. And to top it we had a breakout of influenza in Cachar. I went crazy coordinating our teams. I wonder how much longer I can do this. I met this interesting person a few weeks ago. Hmm...? He's doing his PhD on meat eating practices... ...in different parts of North East India. Call him over for a lunch. Will be nice to meet him. Let's see. A shirt for your dad and a chador for your mom. Oh! You shouldn't have! This is a good decision. You need to be away from here. Away from her. There you go again. Its nothing like that. Is it? Tell me how your studies are coming along? You're becoming obsessed with a married woman. It's making you lose focus on your studies. Remember when we had a chat about love? You teased me for being afraid to love. Now when I do love someone... ...you're discouraging me. I had said that in some other context. And now you're calling this love? It's an illicit affair. Illicit affair? I haven't even touched her. Not even by accident. Taken a vow to not do it with a married woman? No Elias bro. I'm afraid of losing whatever I have with her. We're having a small get together tonight. Please do join us. Tonight at 8 p.m. I'll definitely come. What's on the menu? Broiler chicken, canned fish, imported frozen lamb. All the things you love to eat. Is it? I think I'll be vegetarian tonight ;) You must be Piku. Yes. - Thank you. - Sumon! Meet Jumi. Sumon. Sumon...? Sumon Boruah, Sister. Just call me Jumi. Come. Meet Dilip. Come. Honestly speaking, I prefer the village life. People there are so simple. And they go out of their way if they want to help you... Dilip. This is Sumon. Hello young man! Welcome...Welcome. Nirmali talks highly of you. Meet everyone. Everyone this is Sumon. He is a journalist. No! PhD student. Oh. Do you drink? Good. Excellent. The bar's over there. Choose your own poison. Feeling shy? No, not at all. Then enjoy yourself. I’ll go check on the meat. ...everyone knows everyone in a village... Mina. Will you take this around? He's such a cutie. There you go again! He's a nice boy. Just leave it at that. A nice boy - who's in love with you. As if... Its so obvious every time he looks at you. God, hope Dilip doesn’t catch it. You know Sumon... ...I had once gone to a small flood-affected village. ...to supply medicines. I had to trek through waist high water. When I got out of the water... ...there were a dozen fat leeches stuck to my clothes. Disgusting! But its part of the job. In some parts of Europe that would've made for a great meal. Anyway, it was worth it. If we hadn't reached there on time... ...Cholera would've wiped out everyone. Dilip, you're truly awesome! Just a minute. Hey! Listen. You’re with Jumi, isn’t it? I'm Nirmali sister's guest. Oooh. Nirmali...! - Excuse me. - Oh, sure! Thank you. ...and that's why... ...someday your selfless service for the people will be rewarded. You’ll do us all proud and win a National Award! And that'll just be the start! Thank you. And there's a saying in English... “Behind every successful man... There is a.... ...woman.” True. Without her love and support, I’d be nothing. Cheers...! Now let's have dinner. Sure. You know... ...last time we had a camp at Goalpara and... Take some more chicken. No, no, serve Sumon. He won't eat it. It's broiler. Sir, I don't eat processed meat. The duck is really tasty though. Well I will. I get enough country chicken in the field. Mom. Can't eat anymore... It’s ok. Give. Go wash your hands. I don't care what kind of meat is served. As long as it's cooked well. Really? Yes. How about a perfectly cooked crow? Eww. I meant normal meat Dilip. Actually, the definition of 'normal' isn't universal. When it comes to eating meat, what's normal for you. May be abnormal for others. Wow. Out comes the academic from inside him! No no... He's right though. I have seen people eating the strangest of things. Strange doesn’t cover it. At the department... ...we've catalogued meats eaten by people in our region. Wild animals such as deer, elephant, monkey... ...wild birds to what is considered taboo... ...like dog and cat meat... And truly bizarre stuff like... Lizards Worms Snakes Snails Dragonflies Earthworms Spiders Grasshoppers Termites Monitors Weaver ants Moths. Hey we're still eating here... Ah, where did I keep it? It hasn’t even been a week. Ah, Niri, please... Our camp will shut down f I don't go submit the certificate. But it hasn’t even been a week. What to do? They need me there. And us? Piku and me? We don't need you? Oh God, Niri. What's wrong with you? You’ve never acted like this before. You know this very well. To serve those left behind. And Niri... You yourself used to say... ...that if we don't make small sacrifices, how will society progress? True. Against the great unwashed who are yearning... for the love and care of Dr. Dilip Saikia... ...how can we possibly compare? The certificate is in the study. Where are you going? Mina. Where's she going? She didn't say! That night when you talked about forbidden and bizzare meats... ...it was sojnteresting. Have you eaten all of them? Not even half as much as I'd like to. Have you had dog meat? Dogs? No. I love them. You loved your rooster too... But you ate it. You want to try bat meat? Hello Elias bro, I need your help. Hello. Where are you? Home. You? Listen. I told Dilip, I've gone to see a play with you. Oooh! Welcome to the club Niri... Just shut up. I'm only going out to eat with him. Who said anything about anyone? Look. I just had a fight with Dilip. And I don't want him to know that I'm with Sumon. Elias bro said I can take his car. Rakesh. Rakesh. I'm going for a movie with Niri. Might get late. So this place... does it have a name? No name. Its deep inside a plantation. Only those who know go there. But the meat is really tasty. As long as I get a spoon! - I love this... - This song is so. Anything else? No thanks. Shall we? Absolutely. Just drop me here. What? I'll walk from here. What’s wrong? It was going so well. I was thinking... If she’s eating bat meat with me... ...what else will she do tonight? Just then I noticed... a bit of food stuck on her chin. Just below those lovely tender lips of hers... I reached out with my finger... ...like this. And she leaned in... And then...? No idea. The whole mood of the evening changed. But...that's not what's important. She leaned in, before she moved back. Stretching it a bit, aren't we? Not at all. She really wanted me to touch her. Don't you get it? I knew all along that she has feelings for me? What I get is... ...that a desperate guy is trying very hard... ...to convince himself. I’m telling you. If she wasn't married, things would've been so different. Listen. You're just a useful idiot for her. A pleasant distraction in her dull life... having a lovelorn younger man follow her around. I bet she laughs about it with her friends. Now let me finish my work. I just don't understand... ...why you dislike her so much. How does it feel? Soon... ...you'll be inside it. Hey Sumon. Hey. Hey. I'm done here, let’s go. Elias bro... ...I'm going to feed her my own flesh. Yeah, yeah, sure. Let's go now. Good morning, Elias bro! Elias bro! Good morning! - What’s gotten into you? - Have your tea. When was the last time you got bed tea? Did you not sleep at all last night? No. I was working. Working? I swear. I was up all night researching. But now, I need a bit of your help. Ah. So, hence the tea. Ugh...no sugar... - I need a sample. - Sample? A sample of meat. A sample of meat? A sample of my own flesh. Your own flesh? For an experiment. I need to get back to sleep. Elias bro... Just a sample of my meat for research. Leave me alone. Let me sleep. Please. I wouldn't bother you if I could do it myself. I read up. Extracting a sample of your own meat isn't easy. I don't have the experience, tools or an OT. Will you just let me sleep? Look, look... ...all you have to do is cut a small sample... From here or here. What do you say? No way. You should remove your shorts. Take this. Elias bro. Done. Listen, it'll still hurt. After the anesthesia wears off. No problem. No pain, no gain. Feel anything? Not a thing. Cut away. Bora da. Oh. Sumon! Sister...? Busy with a patient. No problem. Can you please give her this? What is it this time? Venison? Just give it to her. She's with a patient. - Wait for a while. Give it yourself. - No, no. Please take it in right now? - Right now...? - Yes. But she’s with a patient. Please Bora da! Just tell her it's from me. Give it. Told you she's busy. I've kept it on her table. Ok, thank you. I'll be off then. I'm really sorry if I upset you inadvertently. I've left something for you to taste. Hope you like it. Hi Piku. Hello Ma. What are you up to? Homework? - Is it done? - Yes. Good. Go freshen up. I'll be with you in a bit. Sister. Will you eat something? What’s there? I had made some onion fritters. Isn't there any meat? You've been eating so much meat lately. Sumon got me a tiffin at the clinic. I saw. Its some kind of egg dish. - Egg? - Yes. With some kind of meat mixed in it. Is it? Bring it over. Here it is. Hi. Thank you for the dish. I loved it. Specially the meat. Never tasted something like this. What kind of meat was it? I'm so glad you liked it. I had cooked it with a lot of effort. But what it was... I'll tell you in person. Whatever it was, I want more, ok? Now tell me. Uh...l cooked a duck egg. I know that. And...? And... Garlic... Onions... Carrots, chillies... Salt... And...? A bit of my own flesh. Sorry...? I cooked. ...a bit of my flesh, from my thigh... Your...flesh? Actually I... Don't say a word. I get it. You like it? Is this...? All day and all night... ...It's all I think about now. I feel as if I’ve tasted the fundamental flavour of life. And this has made me forever hungry. The small bits that you feed me... ...do nothing for me. I want more now. Well cooked... ...and bursting with that amazing flavour. Hey Niri! Missing him...? I told you, you should've brought him along. Oh Jumi. If you only knew half of it. Have you... ...done it with him? Shut up! What kind of vulgar question is that? Just asking. I know, you're not like me and all that. Hey. So, what did I miss? Nothing much. You've barely touched your food. Everything I eat... ...tastes like straw. My stomach gets filled... ...but I am always hungry. I am not hungry. The hunger gnaws at me. All I do is wait... ...for the next time you'll feed me. There is a slight infection. I have given some medicines, that should take care of it. And... Bora da! Bora da! Sister? Who got that? That? Don't you remember? The medical rep who had come...? He gave it to us. Ok. That’s all. Sometimes I feel... ...this infinite hunger is affecting my mind. Sister, can I help you? You know so much about meat... Brother, move, move! Watch out! ...isn't there any place where they serve this meat? Brother, did you get hurt? Sorry. You don't have to go anywhere. My whole body is here for you. "I don't want you to suffer anymore. So I was thinking... I don't really need my toe. I'll be doing desk-bound jobs anyway. If I were to lose it... ...bet I won't miss it much. What do you say, Elias bro...? Cut it off then. Elias bro...? I spoke to Jayanta the other day. You’ve been cooking in your room? So...? Tell me the truth. This is not about your research. What sick shit are you and that doctor into? Forget it, Elias bro. Forget it? You're cutting yourself! And for what? "Love?" Technically, you're cutting me. Not me. Okay, fine. Not any more. This ends here. Forget about the toe. Just from the usual place. Come. Do you think I’m joking? When I'd told you... ...that this was an experiment... ...I wasn't lying. I wanted to see if there are other ways... ...to get physical with your lover. And for both of us... ...the results are very encouraging. Listen. You're not well. Go back home to your parents for a while. Or this will destroy you. These days all you do is give sermons. Just cut me, I'm getting late. Get out. So, you won’t do it? You heard me. Get out. Fine, then. I'll do it myself! Hey! What are you doing? Give it back! Give it back! Give it back I say! It's not possible. Yet, it is. I've seen your case history. You've consulted doctors from here to Bombay. You can't be pregnant. You have ovarian dysfunction. You should do one more test. It's the third test. Done it twice before. Positive. And you're sure... Yes. It's Eddie's. Not Rakesh's. Oh, Jumi. I can't abort it. I've wanted a baby all my life. I know, Jumi. Why Eddie? Don't worry. We'll work something out. "Sorry Sister, won’t be possible today." Hello. Where are you...? Can you come to the hospital? Right now. Sumon! This one's unclaimed. Just came in a few hours ago. Absolutely fresh. Accident victim. No disease. Let's cut some of the meat and take it. But quick! Someone may come. Some from the leg... ...some from the arm. Leg... ...and arm. What are you doing? Shhh! Someone may come. Just look at yourself. This isn't you. - Let's get out of here. - No! Today's my eating day. - Please. - I shall eat today! Yes, you shall. Yes, you shall. I will feed you. Elias bro refused to cut me... ...but he's not the only one is he? Give it to me. No. I don't want your pathetic tidbits any more! I want more. I want this! Thi...! Let's go. I thought you'd understand my hunger... ...that's why I'd called you to help me. The whole hospital has CCTVs. You think no one would've found out? I’m going insane, isn't it? This is all my fault. I can't bear to see you like this. Then help me! Help me! How? Just tell me... I'll do anything. Walk me home? You're right... Stealing from the morgue was a stupid idea. I have symptoms of acute addiction. I can either struggle with it for months. years, maybe forever... ...or I can eat my fill once... ...and get over it. If I could eat well just once. I'll never crave it again. What do you want to do? Randomly slit someone's throat? It's easier to poison. But it may contaminate the flesh. Can't believe you're thinking so seriously about it. Then what should I do? Sit back. And let the hunger consume me? I got a call from Dilip today. Even Piku feels it. God knows what Mina and Bora da think. I need to get over this before it gets worse. What if the pposite happens? What if you want to eat more? Fine... ...you eat your fill once. But... ...I'll get the meat. Mina...? I'm almost there. I started this... ...and I'll finish it. Or you may actually try to kill someone. ...and that would be a disaster. When. Tonight. It's your eating day after all. Thank you for doing this. I'll never forget it. Sister, I can't carry the meat back to my hostel. What do I do? Bring it to the clinic. I'll be up. Don't get the whole body. Just from the arm, and from the leg. Stop right here. Brother, the rent is 10 rupees. Hey, what're you doing? Please let me know once you're done. Hey! What's going on? Stop. Deka! Ali! Catch him! What were you doing, huh? Who were you cutting? Hold him, he was cutting up a man! Sumon Boruah, do you know how much trouble you're in? Sir, his phone is buzzing. You have no right to see my phone! What the hell is this? Tell me everything. From the beginning. Look, I can do this all night long. Understood? Sister...? O sister...? Its 6.30 already. Piku's school...? Did you sleep here all night? Nirmali Saikia? Warrant. You'll have to come with us. You're under arrest. Ok roll! Roll! Right now we are in Beltola where... ...as you can see the police has just arrested a lady. You'll be shocked to know that she is a doctor... ...and she has had a person murdered just to eat his flesh. Only to satisfy her bizarre hunger. FEMALE CANNIBAL! Big breaking news! A PhD student from the University... ...along with his lover... ...has murdered a man to eat his flesh! Details of this shocking and barbaric crime.. exclusively on News. Today's incident has brought shame to all Assamese. The fact that in our quiet and simple society... ...such depraved people exist... ...has shamed us around the world.
