[instrumental music] [wind howling] [dog panting] [instrumental music] [engine rumbling] [panting] [music intensifies] [gasps] [muffled screaming] [instrumental music] [dog barking] [music continues] Morning. Good morning, Sonya. Mm. Are you in a hurry? Just a little bit late. Well, you have time for breakfast 'cause I made your favorite. Starting to look like a gorger. [chuckles] George, careful. She might take that as a compliment. Well, that was not my intent. Dad, everyone dresses like this at my school. Hm. I got an A on my calculus test. Oh, that's great, chey. We know how hard you work. Sure, but you've got other responsibilities, okay? I want you to come to the store. -Right after school. -Okay. Oh, and remember the whole kumpania'sgonna be celebrating at the Raeesi's tonight. You're gonna need some time to get ready. Lots of boys from the kumpania will be there. And you need to look your best. I told you, you have to start thinking about your future. -[phone buzzing] -Okay. Now if I don't leave, I really will be late. Oh. Sonya? Sonya? I know you're learning a lot at the gorger school, but don't forget who you are. Okay? Yes, daj. I know who I am. Don't worry. -Okay. -Bye. Bye. [sighing] [instrumental music] Oh, my God, look at you. Let's go. I'm freezing. It's so subtle, yet so profound. That girl-next-door ponytail. The no-makeup makeup. You're even wearing plain white socks, aren't you? So far the philosophy is less jewelry, more denim. What do you have against jewelry now? What? You think this is too much? On you? Never. [chuckles] What did your parents say? "Ah, you're starting to look like a gorger." Well, you are. Wait till they find out about Ray. So, uh, how did you do on the algebra test? -B plus. -Oh. That's so good! But why are we even trying so hard anyway? I mean, you know how many scholarships we're eligible for. How many colleges are salivating at the idea of having Romani students on their campus? What? They'll probably put us on the cover of the brochures. Mm. Yeah, I know. I just wanna make sure that we're all still able to go to the same school. And we will. That's always been the plan. That's still the plan, right? Yeah. Yeah. It's just that Ray and I have been talking about applying to some of the bigger schools. I mean, we can apply to Yale, or Princeton, or Columbia. Those are some hardcore schools. Hello, ladies. Hey, Ray. So? What? AP Physics? Oh, uh, yeah, A minus. Still on track. I'm really thinking Princeton. [chuckles] [Sonya] Fabulous! [instrumental music] [birds chirping] Okay, so the kumpania starts arriving at 7:00, with Mr. Raeesi's welcome at 7:30. What time is the caterer scheduled? -5:30. -And set-up? Everything will be ready for the caterer by 5:00. Good. Very good. Ella, the silver is shining perfectly. Thank you, ma'am. -Good morning. -Good morning. -Good morning. -Morning. Oh, thank you. Thank you, Mona. Mm. Well... I need to be heading out. I should be back around 6:00. Everything ready for a wonderful gathering? Yes. Just reviewing final details. It'll be a wonderful celebration. Fantastic. Mm. [doorbell chimes] -Hi. -Hey. Glad you're here. How was school? -Good. -Good. Um, I gotta check inventory and post some invoices. Can you... Oh, yeah. [laughing] [boy 1] What is this? [boy 2] I don't know, man. Some gypsy crap. Can I help you? Yeah, uh, can you tell me my fortune? [sniggering] Shut up. Shut up. [both laughing] -You... -Uh... Oh, look, tarot cards. Oh. So if I pay with my debit card, is your machine gonna clone it? -Do you want these or not? -[doorbell chimes] Why don't you ask your crystal ball? [Savani] I know what I see in my crystal ball. You two brats are just waiting for a good old-fashioned Romani curse. -Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. -Ooh! I call upon the ancient forces of my ancestors... to curse thee with a tiny member. Oh. Oh, you've already been cursed. [chuckles] [laughing] [George] Okay, okay, that's enough! Come on, get out of here! Why didn't you come get me? We had it under control, Mr. Jasaraska. Under control? Making a mockery of your own people is having it "under control?" I know your parents taught you better than that. Dad, it's fine. They're gone and won't be back. Are you done your invoicing? Savani, I'm sorry. It's okay. Nothing I haven't heard from the kumpaniabefore. [sighs] You still okay about tonight? Of course. They can try and shun me away, but I'll just keep coming back anyway. I'll see you later. Bye. [doorbell chimes] Why are you still friends with her? We have classes together. That family has a bad standing in this community, Sonya. -Her dad does. -They both do. Her father tried to undermine us from the inside, and now his daughter is trying to convince the gorgers that we're freaks. Do you have understand how hard we've worked to overcome that? -Yes, dad. -Then why do you encourage it? I don't! I just... She's my friend. Okay? A Romani friend. But she's not good for you, chey, she's not good for the kumpania. [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] [singing in foreign language] [Ian] Are you enjoying it? It's great to see you. Hello. Thank you so much... [laughing] [indistinct chatter] Christian better make a move. If I have to wait any longer I might have to go grab him myself. And what if you did? This is why we want you around more, Sonya. Why go to that gorger school anyway? Mm. Because there's more than just this. Good luck finding a Romani man that will let you have a job and have a career. [music continues] [Ian] Kumpania! Welcome! It is wonderful for us to be gathered together today. Oh, I would like to thank my beautiful wife, Glenda, for organizing all of this and all our community events because I will tell you it would not be possible without her. [applause] Okay, so it's been a big year for us. This is the year where our community celebrates its 25th anniversary. Twenty-five years. [applause] Now some of us have been here from the beginning. I'm not gonna lie, it hasn't been easy, but it has been worth it. [applause] Our children are flourishing. They're becoming incredible young men and women. We're proud of all of you. Now where is Chase? Chase Kiraly, where are you? As you know, we are celebrating Chase Kiraly's 18th birthday. And his father has informed me that Chase has asked for Miriam Ahern's hand in marriage! Miriam, please, come on up. Congratulations. Come on up. [applause] Wonderful. Over here. Congratulations to you both. [indistinct chatter] [Ian] I met and married the love of my life when I was 14 years old. Now we go to school and we get married at 18. But I'll tell you what hasn't changed. The vital importance of the union of two of our own in marriage. It is the lifeblood of our community. -Am I right? -[applause] And I congratulate both of you. Oh, and one more thing Alex, please, come on up here. -Come on, come on. -Alex. [man] There he is, there he is. My son Alex will be celebrating his 18th birthday and I hope to be announcing his engagement as well. Am I right, Alex? Ladies? Just so you know. Okay, let's celebrate. Enjoy. [instrumental music] [singing in foreign language] -Hey girl. -Oh, hey. -You okay? -Yeah. Just feeling all the eyes on me. You can't think like that. Easy for you to say. Everyone here loves you. Mm. Not that one. [chuckles] -What? -Nothing. He's cute. Look. Is he serious? Would you go? -Well, it beats being here. -Mm. [George] What is she doing? She could have the choice of any boy she wants here when they approach her, she ignores them. Honey, relax. It'll happen. People are starting to notice. Honey... What are you whispering about? Oh, you know. Just deciding which one of these boys is worth our time. What about Chris Gheorghe? I think he's gay. Uh, I don't know, maybe Alex Raeesi, maybe. The Romani Prince Harry? Savani Paramush, kumpaniapariah, and Alex Raeesi, heir to the throne? A match made in hell. Maybe he's into that. You girls are all looking festive this evening. You having a good time? Savani. Julia. Sonya, we hardly ever see you. Are you enjoying yourself? Of course, you always host such great parties. I think that we'll be celebrating an 18th birthday for you soon, right? Yup. In a few weeks. [keypad beeping] Will I have the pleasure of announcing your engagement? Hopefully. Mr. Raeesi. Ian. George, good to see you. Yes. You as well. It's a wonderful party. Well, I was just telling your lovely daughter how excited we are to celebrate her birthday. [instrumental music] Oh, I love this song. You girls should go out and dance. Please. -Enjoy yourself. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go, go, go. So tell me about that wonderful market of yours. Well... [instrumental music] [door unlocks] Savani? Boo! [laughing] What is wrong with you? -I couldn't resist. -Good. I don't want you to resist. Well, maybe you do. Hm-mm. Listen. It's a slow dance. I didn't know you were that kind of girl. Oh, well, I guess I should be going, then. No. No thank you. Oh. Jeez. Alex. It's time to say goodbye to our guest. -Look-- -Now. Please. Goodbye, Savani. [door opens] [door closes] What are you doing? Paramush girl, in my office? While we host the entire kumpania? I know. I... [sighs] [groans] You know that I want what's best for you. Yeah. Then why do you keep seeing that girl? Hm? Because it's not what you think, okay? She is smart. And she's funny and... Come sit down. You are a Raeesi. Hm? And it's a name to be honored. You understand? Yeah. Yes, sir. Well, you show me you are proud of who you are. Hm? Okay. [door opens] [door closes] [instrumental music] You got that dreamy look again. [chuckles] What are you thinking about? You and me getting on a train, on our way to Princeton. [chuckles] I like that. [chuckles] Yeah. It's a nice dream. It's not, it's not only a dream. That's why we're studying so hard. Right? Right. I'll be lucky to even go to college let alone move away to an Ivy League. They can't expect you to stay around here forever. They can. What if we just go right now? We jump a bus or a train and go? [chuckles] And do what? I don't know. Just get away from here. [train horn blaring] What's goin' on? I'll be 18 soon. And? And I should be engaged by now. If I don't get married soon, I'll be exiled. Well, I was planning to save this for later, but, um... Sonya Jasaraska, will you-- Don't you dare. [laughing] [instrumental music] [doorbell chimes] Hello, George. Ian! I-I wasn't expecting you. Yeah, I've been meaning to come by soon. I'm sorry it's taken me so long. Well... Well, look at this place. George, I'm grateful for what you've done with this market. It's become an institution in our community. -How long has it been? -Uh, over 20. Almost since the beginning. Like you said, we needed a place for Romani to shop. Yeah, but you saw it. You had the vision, you created it. Thank you, George. [sighs] I'm worried about Alex. You know... He's got a good thing going for him, but he's unfocused. He's unmotivated, you know? He's almost 18 and I don't feel like he really wants to get married or have someone look after him once Glenda and I are gone. Well, I could relate to that. Yeah, Sonya's gonna be turning 18, too. She's smart, that girl, George. She's independent. She's got a fire in her soul. She can make things happen. Can't she? She's still going to public school. Hanging out with that Paramush girl. She's not veering from our ways, is she, George? No. Not at all. Her mother and I won't let her. That's great, that's great. I'm very glad to hear it. Tell you something, George, I've been thinking. Sonya needs an anchor in our community and Alex, he needs a fire to ignite what's inside him. Make him wanna live. I think they'd make a great combination. [chuckles] Y-yes. [laughing] What do we have here? -Your choice. -Cohiba? -Go ahead. -Fantastic. -Oh, no, please-- -Please, George. George, please. We'll talk soon. -Thank you. -Mm-hm. Thank you. [doorbell chiming] [Ray] How was the cake? [Sonya] A man from the kumpania baked it. How was the icing? How was his cake? Oh, no. It was great. It was a delicious vanilla buttercream, yeah. And then what? And then everyone in the kumpaniagathered around to do the birthday dance. Like, everyone in the entire community? Mm-hm. Do you even know the birthday boy? [chuckles] Met him a couple times, I think. Our community has grown so much over the past few years, but we still gather and act like we're small. I can't even, like, imagine something like that. My parents, they just work, come home and watch TV. Then we see the rest of the family at holidays. I wanted to-to know what it's like. Don't think that'll happen. No? What if I pretend to be a young Romani boy who just moved to town? Oh. Yeah. I think they'd see right through you, Mr. Fine. [chuckles] I'm not gonna meet your family, am I? I'm not supposed to be talking to gorgers much less dating one. Well, we better get you off the street then before someone sees you. What about your parents? Not home. [chuckles] Morgan? I'm in here, hon. It's amazing, we've been saying our prayers and they have been answered. Mwah! Just like that! Well, tell me. Ian Raeesi came into the shop today. Mm-hm. He wants Sonya to marry Alex. He does? She'll be a true Romani woman. We'll finally have a seat at the table in this community. -Hey, what's wrong? -It's just, um... I've been wanting to talk to you about her engagement. I... Alex Raeesi? I don't know. I... do you really think that he's the right choice for her? Of course he is. Oh... What about Lash Charani, or, uh, or Pesha Costello? She's known both of those boys since childhood. Why would we turn down the Raeesis for one of those boys? Do you know what we stand to gain by joining that family? Because this is happening too fast. And, and I would like some time to talk to our daughter. Well, this is what we've always wanted. She'll never have to worry. We'll never have to worry. Yeah, but it's not just that, George. T-that family, w-what about their daughter? You know, the one they sent away to live with relatives. I mean, nobody's heard from her since. It's odd, don't you think? Look, It's not our place to judge their choices. God forbid people would look at Sonya she's practically abandoned our way of life, but does that mean we're not good parents? We're not trying our best? No. It'll be fine. Alex is a good boy, becoming a good man who can provide a wonderful life for our daughter. She'd be lucky to call him her husband. Even she will see that. Trust me. Just give me some time. Okay? Just don't rush into this. Just give me time to get her ready. Okay. Okay. ♪ Fallin' ♪ Some other place some other time ♪ ♪ When all the pieces realign ♪ We'll be fallin' [phone buzzing] Uh, I can't stay late. Dinner.

Yes. You need to make a very good first impression, Sonya. Oh. Gosh, you're beautiful. You'll have the attention of every boy in the kumpania. [chuckles] Do you like it? It's okay. [sighs] Sit. Listen. I was sixteen when I married your father. And that was old for my time. Your grandmother was practically tearing her hair out. You're eighteen. To her, that would have been scandalous. But the truth is, chey, I was indecisive and my mother chose your father for me to marry. And I was not excited about it. But all of that changed once I got married. And I had you. I found my purpose. You know, just like you're gonna find yours. Sonya... it's time... it's time for you to choose a husband. Chey... I know, daj. And I want to get married. I just need time. Chey,you have to understand the time that you need may not be the time you get. But you will be a beautiful bride. [chuckles] Yeah. I'll be turning 18 on Wednesday. And then at that point, I can do whatever I want. Legally. You see me as an equal, right? Well... given who I was before I met you. I'd say you're objectively pulling much more weight than me. You know what I mean. I just... didn't expect a boyfriend to be so good for me. I didn't expect to meet someone like you. I didn't plan for this either. Come to my birthday. Really? Yeah. It's gonna be super weird. And you're gonna have to wear a suit. Yeah. Girl, you know I'm game. Just tell me when and where. [instrumental music] Are we almost done makeup? Yup. Just let me finish. Uh, ladies, we gotta go in 45 minutes. [scoffs] Okay, George. I just want her to look perfect. I don't wanna be late. You do look perfect. [chuckles] Are you ready for your life to change tonight? More than you know. [deep breathes] [instrumental music] You look amazing. Happy birthday, Sonya. Thank you. I'm kinda freaking out. It's just a party. It'll be over soon. -Happy birthday! -Thanks. Um, I kinda did something crazy... I invited Ray. Did you warn your parents? No, I'm kinda just hoping that if they meet him here they won't be able to make a scene. Well, when is he coming? Any minute. [indistinct chatter] [mouths] What? [singing in foreign language] Let's get punch. It's spiked. Uh, no. I'm gonna stay right here. Direct line of sight. Okay, I'll bring you some. Happy birthday, Sonya. Thank you. This is it. How's your evening so far? Going well? You look beautiful. Really. Uh, thanks. I just got here, actually. [sighs] Um... Okay, well, would you like to dance or... Sorry, I have to go. I'm so glad to see you. God, you are so beautiful. Hey. Happy birthday, Sonya. Sonya, what's going on? -Sonya? -He, um... He's my boyfriend! -Boyfriend? -What? Is he Romani? Alex was supposed to propose to you tonight. What? You arranged my marriage? As if you gave us a choice. I'm not marrying Alex! [Ian] My kumpania! No, no. [Ian] Beautiful kumpania. -Let go of me! -Stop! Stop this. [Ian] All right, let me get everyone's attention. Gather around. That's it, gather around. Come on. Please. Thank you for joining me on this most auspicious occasion. We are here to celebrate the 18th birthday of the lovely Sonya Jasaraska. -[crowd applauding] -Where's Sonya? [indistinct chatter] What was that? That was parental drama. Look, my dad wants me to marry Sonya. When were you gonna tell me? I... Like, I just found out. What did Sonya say? Judging by her reaction, I think that she probably just found out too, so, I guess that's one thing we have in common. [laughs] This isn't funny, Alex. -Sa-- -What now? Th... This is what my father has orchestrated. And-and since when do you just do whatever your father wants? Look, we don't have to reject our entire community just to get what we want, you know. I'm gonna be leading the Kumpaniaone day, and I'll be calling the shots. -Yeah, married to Sonya. -So? What do you mean, "So?" Look... [sighs] One way or another, I'm marrying Sonya... but we can figure this out. I can't believe this. Sonya? Sonya, let's talk about this. Oh, so now you want to talk to me? Hey, do not disrespect your mother. -[slams door] -[phone ringing] [sighs] Ian. No, no, no, no. Ev-everything's fine. I'm sorry we left in such a hurry. Uh-uh, Sonya's not feeling well. Uh, but we just got home and she's gone straight to bed. -[indistinct chatter] -[mellow music] -[sniffles] -[keypad beeps] [phone vibrating] Sonya, where are you? You okay? -This is such a mess. -What's going on? Are you all right? I just had a huge fight with my parents. It's over for now, but I'm so sorry for dragging you into this, Ray. I was so stupid to think that there was any chance of tonight going well. Sonya, it's okay. They want me to marry a boy from the kumpania. Yeah, I-I sort of figured that out. -I'm not going to. -Yeah, I know. They honestly thought I would just go along with it. -Want me to come get you? -Can you, please? -I'm on my way. -Was that her? Yeah, let's go. Where do you think you're going? Go to bed. You didn't answer my question. What, Sonya? Sonya? What is this? Ray's picking me up, I'm staying with him. -Absolutely not! -Sonya, please. I'm 18 years old-- Then stop acting like a selfish, stupid little girl! Stop it, George. We know what is best for you. What's best for me? I'm literally at the top of my class. I can get into any college in the country. And you want me to marry some spoilt brat whose only ambition is spending his inheritance! -Listen to me, Sonya. -Mom, I'm in love with someone! I don't want your crappy version of marriage! -Don't you dare-- -George! [George] Stop! -[Sonya] Dad! -Stop! Dad, stop! Ray! -Ray! -[George grunting] [indistinct shouts] [Ray] Sonya! [Morgan] George, stop! [Sonya] Dad, stop it! -[indistinct chatter] -Sonya! -Sonya! -[Sonya] Ray! [Sonya sobbing] -Hey! -What are you doing? -Dad! -[dramatic music] [Sonya] Dad! [phone ringing] It's Ian. [line ringing] [woman on phone] 911, what's your emergency? We need to report a kidnapping. Yeah. Our friend is being held against her will. [woman on phone] Do you know where she is? She's in her house. Her parents won't let her leave. [woman on phone] How old is your friend? Um, 18. She just turned 18 today. [woman on phone] Maybe she's just been grounded. No, no, no, no, that's not... it at all. Listen, look, we need help right now, okay? [woman on phone] Do you have reason to believe that she's in immediate danger? She might be. Like, everything, it got very heated very fast. Her father physically threw us out of the house. [woman on phone] Were there any weapons involved? No. [woman on phone] Sounds like a family disagreement to me. What? This isn't a matter for the police. No. Listen, please we need help, okay? [line cuts] You locked our daughter in the basement. What's your plan? My plan is for her to come to her senses. We raised her to be a good Romani girl. I told you that this would take time. I'm going to bed. [exhales] [mellow music] -[latch clicks] -[breathing heavily] Daj. Daj,I'm leaving. You've been planning this for a while now. You know, I was in love with a gorger, too, once. Really in love, he was a really good guy. What happened? Well, before I let him take me completely away from my family, I realised that he could never build a family with me. He could never give me a life that would allow me to fulfill my purpose. My parents arranged for me to marry your father. A man who could create with me a life worth living. And look, I know you have contempt for our marriage, Sonya, but I assure you that we are doing exactly what we set out to do. And I know this in my heart because we created you. And we also helped create this community. This community that you are running away from. And I know it's hard, you know I know it's hard, to fulfill your responsibility to family and community. It's your 18th birthday and we should be celebrating. Instead, we're an embarrassment... I never asked for any of this. -What am I supposed to do? -Stop acting like a victim! I would have killed for this life when I was your age. I thought I raised you to be grateful. I am grateful for everything that you've done, but I also want to live mylife. [sniffles] Then go. But know that your father will not let you come back. It's not yours. [mellow music] [Sonya sniffles] [door shuts] [dramatic music] [gasps] [muffled screaming] -[line ringing] -[exhales] [Sonya] Hey, it's Sonya. Leave a message. Hey, um... I just wanted to hear your voice I wish you'd pick up, I'm just really, really... starting to get worried about you. -[sighs] -[keypad beeping] [line ringing] -[phone vibrating] -[sniffles] Ray... Yeah. H-have you heard from Sonya? No. Have you? No, uh, Savani, what are we going to do about this? This is so messed up. I know. It's gonna be okay, Ray. Okay? We'll go tomorrow and we'll figure this whole thing out. It's gonna be okay. [sniffles] [sighs] [instrumental music] There you are. Uh. Mrs. Raeesi? It's nice to wake up so rested, isn't it? [breathing heavily] How did I get here? Don't worry about that. We need to get you ready for breakfast. Oh. I was thinking you to wear this today, it's so lovely, it'll help bring out your eyes. [chuckles] [gasps] You kidnapped me? Sweetie, those sheets are 600 thread count Egyptian cotton. And this is not a kidnapping. [door rattling] You know, your engagement to Alex didn't quite go as planned, but we can turn this around. You can't keep me here against my will. Sonya, you need to let go of this kidnapping story. I'm giving you thousands of dollars in clothing and jewelry, and you're not even my daughter-in-law yet. Stop, I'm not going to marry Alex! Romani women do not always get to choose what they want. Compared to the others, we've won the lottery. Look at you... You don't t have any bruises, Sonya. Let's keep it that way. [singing in foreign language] And 25 years ago, there was nothing here. Now, thanks to Mr. Raeesi, we have an entire town. He bought the land, hired Romani workers. Built homes for them, helped bring their families over. And more of our people came to join them. They're still coming. [exhales] Alex is waiting for you. -What do you want? -Is Sonya here? She's not here. She's n-not? Well, where is she then? Look, w-what did you do with her? We did what was best. [Sonya] Alex. Thanks for joining me, Sonya. Okay, you, you know that I was kidnapped, right? Yeah, look, I know that is gonna be kind of hard to understand, but you and me are in the same boat here. I was drugged and stuffed into a trunk, so don't tell me we're in the same boat here, Alex. Yeah, I mean, your situation definitely sounds worse, but not by much. Look, this arranged marriage wasn't my idea, all right? I much prefer having fun with Savani. But it's not good enough for my father, so... Well, did you ever think to tell him no? [chuckles] Do you think that he understand what the word no means? Besides, even if I were stupid enough to do this whole thing on my own, do you think that Savani is worth giving all this up? -Ah. -[cutlery clinking] Screw you. You don't deserve her. You think you're smart because you go to that gorger school? Look, you better learn to keep your mouth shut or this arrangement won't go well for you. You idiot. You do know that you're going to jail, right? After I get out of here, you and your entire family are going to jail for kidnapping. Can you guys just give us a minute, please? Just because you've been forced into complacency doesn't mean I will be. Do you still not understand? I am doing this to help you. You think that this is all just because my dad hits me once in awhile? I'm a Raeesi, Sonya. I can do whatever I want. Well, obviously you can't because you're being forced to marry me. -It's complicated. -No, it's not. It's simple. There are expectations to be fulfilled by both of us. I'm thinking of the future, I'm thinking of having a good life, and that is something my sister sacrificed with her defiance. So, Sonya, please just stop resisting and this entire thing is gonna go so much easier for you. You're a coward. I'm done with this. [screaming] Sonya! [breathing heavily] [clears throat] Mr. Raeesi would like to see you now. Good morning, Sonya. You enjoy your breakfast? Well, I hope you haven't lost your voice, because you're gonna be calling your parents and telling them the good news, you accepted my son's proposal. You're crazy. Sonya, look around you. It's crazy for you to not accept what I'm handing you. I'm not accepting anything from you. Not your marriage, not your money. Nothing. [laughs] [sighs] Okay. You will be by my son's side as he leads this community into the next generation. You'll take care of him. Keep his home. You'll nurture his ambition. And you will do it while raising my grandchildren. Because that's your purpose. Mona, Sonya doesn't seem to understand what it means to be a Romani woman. Can you explain it to her? What are you doing? Stop. No. You can put it on, or I'll put it on for you. Either way, you're wearing it. [dramatic music] [tap water running] [George] Morgan. Morgan? I'm headed to the shop. You okay? [sighs] I'm just worried. I mean, if she's not with Savani or that gorger boy, where is she? She'll be fine. I just have this sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. [phone ringing] Sonya? -George. -Oh, Ian, my friend. I was just about to call you. [chuckles] It's funny how in sync we are. I was just calling to let you know that Sonya's here and she's all right. Oh, that's good to hear. -What? She's there? -Shh! Yes, and tell your wife everything's gonna work out as we planned. Ian. Can I speak with Sonya, please? Morgan, I am sorry that she gave you a scare. You know, kids. Look, she's out for a stroll right now with Alex, but I can have her call you later? -Yes, please, have her call me. -Great. And I am so happy to have all of you as part of my family. What is it? Something's really wrong, George. [sighs] It is our job to ensure and uphold absolute purity. And so today you will sterilize this kitchen completely, from countertop to floor. Every drawer, every cabinet cleaned out. Everything pristine and polished. Get started. And if I don't? [Mona sighs] Consequences, Sonya. Get to work. You won't eat until you're finished. [sighs] Let me. First scrub. Then wipe. -First scrub. Then wipe. -Okay. Okay. What you don't clean, I have to clean. I'll do a good job. So, um, my name is Sonya. What's yours? Ella. Well, thank you for the help, Ella. You scrub. I'll wipe. I can do that. So how old are you? Sixteen. Do you live here? Of course. -Don't you? -[scoffs] No. No, someone brought me here. -Against my will. -Well, I've always lived here. I belong here. Well, I don't belong here. I should be in second period right now. I'm gonna start on that side. What is second period? I go to school, so we learn different subjects in different classes we called periods. So you, you read, and learn stories there? Yeah, we read, and I suppose what we learn are stories, yeah. I love stories. Breanna used to tell me stories all the time. That's Alex's sister, right? I miss her. I'm sorry she got sent away. You get to see her? Uh, um, I can't talk about that. [dramatic music] She is a spirited girl. It's exactly why I chose her for Alex. You know what to do. Yes, I do. [deep breathing] I always admired your strength. You're one of the few people I can say that about. I'm starving. [sighs] I need food. When we finish our work. [whispering] What are you doing? Um, ahem, wanna help me with this, uh, sheet? Uh, yeah. [Ella whispering] What are you doing? [coughs] -Sonya, what are you doing? -[phone beeps] You need to watch her more closely. Honey, go get ready for bed. Yes, daj. [Mona clears throat] [dramatic music] You're making me sleep in here? You can't do this! When we can trust you, you'll get your bedroom privileges back. [sobbing] I just want to go home. You are home,Sonya. Go to sleep. Can you tell me the story of my father again? You're getting a little old for stories, don't you think? Your father... he was a great Romani man, Ella. He wanted to create a home for all of us, and he inspired our people to work toward his vision. He took me in when no one else would, and saved my life. He gave me you. [chuckles] And that's the best part of the story. Yeah. It is. [door opens] Help! Help! Somebody help, please! No one can hear you. I thought we should speak again. You're a lunatic. What are you going to do, just keep me locked in here until I die? Sonya... we both have roles to play in this life. And you will remain here until you accept your duty to my son. Marrying your son is not my duty. [sighs] You're so headstrong. I'm not marrying Alex. You're just like Breanna. [inhales sharply] What did you do to her? She made her choice. Now you have to make yours. I'll let you think about it. [door shuts] [instrumental music] You expect me to believe Sonya wants to marry you? She would never agree to this. I want to talk to her. Just calm down, okay? You will. What's your father doing to her? Nothing. Jeez. Can you sit down for a second? No! Sonya is fine, okay? She's happy with this. I don't believe you. It doesn't make sense. It doesn't matter if you don't believe me. It's happening. All arranged. It's done. But what happened to running away together? You're just going to marry someone you don't love? I can't go against this. You don't understand. No, I don't understand, and you do have a choice! You can be with someone who loves you, that you love and that's not Sonya! [sighs] This is what's best. [sighs] This isn't you. I know you. This is your psycho father. Fine. Fine, then just get out. Get out, Alex! Get out! [door opens and closes] [fire crackling] [Ian] Leave us. Leave us. You're not sitting. What's wrong with you? I bring you the best girl in the kumpania and you keep seeing this Paramush girl. -Look, it's not what you think. -I know what it is. I was your age once. It's lust. And you know that she will bring you shame. You know she's not in your future. I mean, her father's a drunk, causes nothing but trouble for this community. You know if it were up to that family, there'd be no kumpaniaand we'd all just be mixed up with the gorgers. But she is my friend. [shuddering] You will marry the Jasaraska girl and you will take your place by my side. Yes, sir. -Listen to me. -[shuddering] This world hates us because of our blood. You know, we've been chased from our homes for centuries, we've been burned in ovens because of who we are. We need the kumpania. And I will not let this Paramush family destroy what I have built. [doorbell rings] [exhales] Morgan? What a lovely surprise! -I've come to see Sonya. -Oh, how nice. Um, I-I'd invite you in for tea, but we're so wrapped up with the wedding prep. Please, Glenda. She's my only child. I just want to see her. Of course. Of course, uh, a-and you will. At the wedding. There will be plenty more time after that when things aren't quite so hectic. I'm sure you understand. Oh, take care, okay? [banging on door] [sobbing] I can't... I can't be by myself. [sobbing] I'm going crazy. Look, what's happening, okay? [sobbing] It's over, Ray. Alex and Sonya are getting married. W... What the f... What are you doing? Didn't you hear me? She quit! She quit on you! I don't believe you! [intense music] [car engine cranking] [banging on door] Yes? I need to speak with Sonya. I'm not leaving here until I do. You're the gorger boy? I'm sorry, but she doesn't want to see you. Sonya! Sonya! Can you hear me, Sonya? Sonya! Sonya! [intense music] Ray! Ray! Ray! Ray! Ray! [shutter creaking] [Ian] My daughter-in-law still hasn't come around. [sighs] Hmm. What a shame, Sonya. You grew up in this community. You saw how hard your parents had to work to earn what they have to become respected members in the kumpania. And you're going to torch everything that they built. Let's catch you up. We're gonna get you up. Here you go. Years ago, your parents came to me and asked me for help. They didn't have a home, they didn't have a job. And they had a little baby on the way. So I agreed, I agreed to help them. And I gave them a home. And I gave them a job. I gave them that store to run. I gave them everything that they needed to raise you. I knew you were a smart, promising young lady. You reject my son's offer. You rejected my family's offer. [softly sobbing] It's clear that you don't want my help so I'm going to stop helping. Hmm? And your parents won't have a home, your parents won't have a job. [sobbing] Is that what you want? Hmm? Good, you're still here. I didn't think your parents would mind. They wouldn't let me see her. I swear I-I heard her screaming. I-I know that they're, they're holding her hostage. [sighs] And? Savani, I don't think you understand how bad this is. I know how bad it is, Ray. What are you going to do, go rescue her? Be her shining knight? Where's my shining knight? This isn't about you, Savani. Your best friend's life is in danger right now, okay? I'm gonna need your help. Oh, I can't help you. You don't understand after this, all I have is the kumpania. Oh... Okay, if you want to believe that then fine. Okay, but I'm gonna go find a way to rescue her and I suggest that you sober up and then decide what's really important. [door opens and closes] Sonya. You need it to be good, okay? Don't be like Breanna. It doesn't work. If you're good, they won't hurt you, I promise. Just please come back and be good, okay? What are you doing? You know you shouldn't be here. Do you want to end up like her? [door shuts] [instrumental music] [Ian] A change of heart? [sighs] I'm pleased to hear it. Mr. Raeesi, I apologize for the way I've behaved. I know I've to rebuild your trust and I hope that in time I can do that by being a good wife and a good daughter-in-law. Hm. [inhales sharply] Well... I know that your parents will be happy to hear the good news. [keypad beeping] [dial tone] -[phone ringing] -Hello. Sonya? Hi, daj. George, she's on the phone. Oh, chey,are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Better than fine actually. What's happening? I'm, uh, going to marry Alex. You were right. [sniffles] Are you sure? Is that what you want? Yeah. [sniffling] Yeah, I'm-I'm very happy. You can come home, chey. You can come home, Sonya. [sobbing] I'm so sorry for what I said before. -I know. -Oh... See you at the wedding. Of course... [sniffles] Sonya. Oh, God, what have we done? [knocking on door] Mr. and Mrs. Jasaraska, I just-- Ray, please come in. Come in. Will you tell me a story? Dajsays I'm getting too old for them, but when Breanna told me then I always felt better. Well, what kind of stories did she tell you? I liked the princess ones the best. [chuckles] Okay. [sighs] Well... There once was a princess who got kidnapped by an evil king because he wanted her to marry his son who was a horrible prince that nobody else wanted. And while she was being held in the dungeon she met a girl who's forced to work as a servant at the castle. She was... also a princess, but she didn't know because she was born at the dungeon, she thought that's all there was. No. Because the two princesses became good friends. And together they were able to escape. Friends look out for each other. It would be nice to have a friend like that. You do, Ella. Ella, it's time for bed. Sonya has a big day tomorrow. Goodnight, Ella. Goodnight. [instrumental music] Well, you make a beautiful bride, chey. Do you think Alex will be happy? Of course. You look lovely. You and my son are going to make beautiful babies. [chuckles] Okay. Could I actually just use the bathroom quickly? Of course. But hurry. Two minutes. Let's fix this. I could never get it. That's a boy. [phone vibrating] Ah! Jeez! Don't do this. Don't marry Sonya. Run away with me. I love you. Don't make me block your number, Savani. Oh, my God. [indistinct] Cannot have the bride late for her own wedding, ya? Almost ready. Just give us a minute. [Ian sighing] [water running] Do you have the ring? Yea... Uh, yeah. Uh... Yes, it's there. Let me see. Okay. [dramatic music] [Ian] I want you to look like a man. Come on. Thank you. Sonya... Oh, my God. She's gone, out the bathroom window. Alex. Ready? Definitely. Where are they? Right on time. [grunting] [muffled screaming] -Should we go in? -Maybe I should just go look. [intense music] I'm disappointed in you, Sonya. I thought you were smarter than this. And think about your poor parents. Hm? They'll be so ashamed. Think of their faces when we tell the rest of the wedding guests you ran off. Ran off? Like Breanna did? Did you dig her grave too? We always do what's best. You're disgusting and a disgrace. If the kumpaniaknew who you really were, Ian Raeesi, your name would be a curse. [Ian] I built this community out of nothing. And now I've fight to keep it alive because of people like you. Our rules and our traditions are what makes us who we are. It's about survival. [inhales] So, if we have to sacrifice one to save us all then so be it. Right. And, uh, please remind me where murder fits in the Romanipen? I'm a little rusty on our customs. And you, did you help him dig your sister's grave or, or was that all him? Don't talk about my sister. Yeah. Maybe you didn't help, but you knew. You knew that your dad killed your sister. -You think-- -Shut up! Alex! Hey, stop! Stop! -[gunshot] -[Ray screams] Oh, God! Sonya. Sonya. -[Morgan] Sonya. -Call 911. Sonya! -Wait! -I'm getting our daughter back. She ran off with the gorger boy. Never to be heard from again. [intense music] [Ian] Chava,be a man. -[Ray] I love you. -I love you too. -Alex, don't do it! -Hey! I know you. This isn't you. Do it. [music continues] Chava... [clamoring] [Ian] You destroyed everything. [metallic thudding] [Sonya] Ella. Friends help each other. [Sonya gasping] All right, you've everything? You've map, address for Ray's rehab. Yes, yes, yes. I have them all. Don't worry, daj,I'll be fine. I can handle it. I know. For one more minute, I get to worry and take care of you. Now, I'm gonna cry, so... Um, I'll meet you out front. [instrumental music] [squealing and laughing] Oh, we should get a move on. Long drive ahead of us. [George] Ray, I trust you'd be following the speed limit at all times with our daughter in the car? Yes, yes, I'll be making sure to take great care of Sonya. Not that she needs it. We'll look out for each other. Yep. Bye. You worked hard for this. I'll miss you so much. Get your grades up and join us next year, right? I will. We'll be roomies. -Absolutely. -[chuckles] And Ella... Yeah! We'll be fighting over who gets to talk to you first. I'm so proud of you, chey. I want you to know that. Okay? I love you. [Morgan] I'm gonna miss you. Okay. Bye. [Morgan sniffling] Hey. -Had breakfast? -No. Come join us, okay? We're doing this. We're doing this.
