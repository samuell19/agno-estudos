Well. That's the last time we shall operate together. You sound very gloomy. You're determined to go? - Quite. I suppose, in your language that means .. Quite. Yes. And where is Dr Wyatt going? Into the wilds to work for a mad brain specialist. Eccentric. Dr Laurience of Genoa. His record is a little unorthodox. - Not when I worked for him in Genoa. You'll find him different now. So take care of yourself. I will. - Goodbye. Goodbye, sister. Seriously Clare, I should think twice before going. Why? Laurience has done brilliant work. - Not in the past three years. You know, they threw him out of Genoa. His ideas became impossible. There is something queer about him now. - Always something queer with a genius. You are set on gong? - Quite. I suppose in your language that means .. quite. Hello. Why aren't you in Fleet Street? I've been checking up on Laurience. He's not the kind of man a young girl should know. Dick. We've been over all that. - You don't know the half of it. He arrived in England with some monkeys and claims he discovered the human soul. He wrote and asked me to go. I'm going. I've got a far better plan. - What? Stay here and marry me. - Dick. I know I've mentioned it before, but you always get the answer wrong. I must go, Dick. It is my job. Hmm. You are going to be awkward. Not awkward, dear. Just firm. Well, in that case. What is that for? I'm coming with you. - You'll do nothing of the sort. You need someone to look after you. Sorry, Dick. But I specialise in looking after myself. Then I have packed my bag for nothing? - I am afraid so. How I hate strong-minded women. Are you for the manor? Yes. Dr Wyatt, I presume. Didn't I tell you I could look after myself? You did. - Well then. I persuaded my editor that there is a story in Laurience. And caught the train you missed. You are very sweet, darling. But when I say a thing .. Go on, driver. - Hey. What about my interview? There isn't going to be an interview. If the monkeys eat you don't blame me. Half a crown, Miss. Can't you take me to the door? I don't go to that door. [ Dog barking ] [ Dog barking ] The name is Clayton. One of the doctor's more hopeless cases. Come in. An inter-cranial cyst. Rare and very curious. - But I thought .. Go on. Say it. I thought that was always fatal. Most of me is dead. The rest of me is damned. Laurience manages to keep the residue alive. 'Why', is his own affair. I am terribly sorry. Don't worry about me. You'll find Laurience in there. Dr Laurience. I am glad to see you. I thought .. You are thinking that I am changed. You are right. I am changed. The leading surgeon in Genoa. The greatest authority on the human brain. Until I told them something about their own brains. Then they said I was mad. Look at me. Am I mad? Is she to have a room? Of course. There are lots of rooms. Take any one you like. Haven't you a housekeeper? Only Clayton. You have seen him. And she was not amused. Why did you send for me? You might have had an experienced scientist. I don't want experienced scientists. Their minds are set. Like trains, they run only to the terminus and then back to the beginning. But I remembered you in Genoa. You were so young. A child. But you had faith in what was new and the courage to face things. Now you shall work with me here. And I shall show you strange things about the mind of man. You will follow me. Without fear? Without fear. Well, did her Ladyship like her room? You didn't want her to come here. I don't like women. - I had to have help in my work. But why choose a woman? - She is a scientist. A female scientist? - Well? All tears and hysterics and can't keep secret. She wanted to work with me and she's going to. Have you told her exactly what your work is? Not yet. Why not tell her? Then perhaps she may change her mind. Hello. Shush. Go away. Do you know why there are no servants in this house? Because they won't stay here. They were scared out of their lives. - How do you know? Your cabbie told me. Laurience is a scientist. With a great reputation. You know what they say in the village? I don't care what they say in the village. Anyway, it all seems fishy to me. Will you please go. No. I won't. [ Dog barking ] I'll be at the Red Bull. Will you promise to send for me if anything happens? Alright. I promise. Anyone there? No. Why? Sorry. I thought I heard voices. Goodnight. Goodnight. The great scientist's assistant washing up a coffee pot. When did you wash it last? Never. I thought not. Well, why wash it when it is never used for anything else? You didn't like me coming here, did you? You don't like me. I'm sorry for you. I wonder which revolts you most. My miserable body. Or my perverted mind. You think: 'Why doesn't Laurience let him die'? Well, I will tell you. Because I am the only person who understands him. I understand him. You understand Laurience? One day you will realize how little you do. You didn't know you told me all that. - I told you nothing. I heard you. - It's lucky Laurience won't see it. Why not? They don't have no paper at the manor. If I don't come back, drag the lake. Where are you going? To the manor. To enrol another certified reader. 'Certified' is right. Hello. I came to see if you were still alright. Well, am I? Apparently. Come for a walk on the estate. Listen, darling. You don't seem to realize I am here on a serious job. You're trying to make it more difficult. - I'm trying to make it impossible. Well, don't. I promise I'll come back as soon as I can. Alright. Goodbye. Goodbye. You don't like serious jobs. On the contrary. All my own work. Take a look. - I will. Goodbye. It's the first time you've taken any interest in food since you've been here. It is the first time there has been any. Come now. Let's get back to work. What's wrong? Nothing. This may amuse you. You told them all this. - Me? Why me? How should I know? Your mind is as twisted as your body. Don't forget. If I leave out one injection .. I don't mind dying. But to be accused of journalism .. This is a very good story. - Yes, Lord Haslewood. I like it very much. - Yes, Lord Haslewood. Do you agree with me? - Yes, Lord Haslewood. Then why is it hidden away at the bottom of a column? Of course, I knew it was your son's story, but .. Nothing to do with it. My son must be treated as if he were an ordinary person. In my opinion the stories .. Why have I spent a fortune on scientific research? Because these days it's news. - But this fellow Laurience .. News. Properly treated. Front page news. If you say so. - I say it's a fact. I have other views. - There are no other views. Then what do you want us to do? - Nothing. You know I never interfere in the conduct of my papers. Then we can forget Laurience? - Most certainly not. I am going down to see him myself. A human brain. A brain like the one in here. The same colour. Appearance. Everything. And only one difference. The thoughts in the brain. The personality. The mind, are all missing. The brain is dead. - That means only this. What I call the 'thought content' of the brain has gone forever. Until now it has never been possible to .. As it were, extract the thought content from a living brain .. And leave it alive but empty. I can do it. I can take the thought content from the mind of a living animal. And store it as you would store electricity. Wait. You see. He likes it. To him it's just like going to sleep. He is alive and well. But his mind is in there. You say it is. But he looked just the same under and anaesthetic. How can you prove it? Would it prove it if I could take this mind .. And put it in the body of another animal? Of course. But you can't. Tonight, I am going to try for the first time. Now. The mind of the one ape is there. The other is there. I reverse the connections. The minds have been changed over. Does that prove it? Each has got the mind of the other. The personality. The likes and dislikes. The things that if they were human beings we would call the 'souls'. If they were human beings? Why not? You can't do that. No. I can't do that. Richard, I am delighted to see you. I'm delighted to see you. I came to congratulate you on your story. All this way for that? - Precisely. It is good work and I am happy to acknowledge it as such. Thank you, father. You seem on good terms with Laurience. A charming fellow. He welcomed me with open arms. Friendly, eh? - Absolutely. I want you to introduce me. I am afraid I can't do that. Why not? I've got to get back to London. Nonsense. You take me to see Laurience. I look forward to an interesting meeting. You'll get it. - I am sure I shall. But you can just introduce yourself. - No, no. Don't tell me he doesn't know who you are. The Haslewood Institute. All you've done in the cause of science. He will be delighted to see you. Yes, yes. Perhaps you are right. Father. I hope I am. Haslewood of the press. Dr Laurience? Good morning. Forgive my coming here unheralded if I may use the term. I imagine my name is not unknown to you. - I do not receive the press. If you're thinking of my newspapers .. You're here to spy on me. On the contrary, dear sir. I am here to make you an offer. I am not a journalist and I am not for sale. Were this a press visit, I should hardly have visited in person. Then why are you here? - In the interests of science. You are a great scientist. One of the most distinguished. Well? In a small and humble way I also worship at the shrine. Doubtless, you have heard of the research institute which bears my name. The biggest thing of its kind in Europe. It is at your disposal. Any conditions? None at all. Except that our results should be given to the world. Through the medium of the Haslewood Press? Naturally. My result would be revolutionary. - All the better. May I take it Dr Laurience that you agree? You'll be sorry if you do. I must work in my own way. How can you work in this atmosphere? If you refer to the smell of bacon, it's no obstacle to scientific research. I must keep my freedom. What freedom have you here? How can you work like this? You will need the finest laboratory you can get. You must accept. Very well. I accept. Yes. Very satisfactory, gentlemen. Very satisfactory. I venture to stay that public interest has never run so high. I am a bit worried about some of the contents bills. Why worried? Don't you think they're a trifle flamboyant? Nothing of the sort. By my express instructions, simplicity has always been our keynote. I think they are definitely cheap. Simplicity is never cheap. I look upon this as a mission of enlightenment. And we must ensure a proper impact upon the public. I shall wish to write a special leader. Something on science and the human mind. With perhaps a thoughtful mention of Freud. Referencing the part my paper plays in furthering the process of evolution. Splashing Laurience? - Naturally. You might use a photograph. There is an excellent one of us taken together. We must never rest until we have made 'Laurience' a household word. But no-one knows what he's done. - No-one knows if he's any good. I flatter myself that I know genius when I see it. In due course I shall arrange for his results to be announced. The scientific world will be fully represented. Later perhaps, you'll consult with me as to the exact form the invites will take. How do you do, Professor. What are you going to infuriate me with this time? Don't ask me. Ask Laurience. It's your laboratory he's using, isn't it? Yes. Specially equipped for him. And I think I can promise you a surprise. I am not partial to surprises. You see, the flower of English science. They seem to have wilted a little. I take that as a personal insult. I am a scientist myself. - Really? Alright. One of these days you will be proud to know me. Wouldn't you rather marry me instead? Definitely not. Definitely not? Definitely not. Have you seen Laurience? - No, Milord. Where is Laurience? We start in precisely three minutes. I'll go and find him. Hold yourself up boy. The finest laboratory you can get. And you have sold yourself for it. They are waiting for you. Haslewood is having a fit. I forgot. I was busy. Why do they have to have this meeting now? Where is your coat? There. I dislike having to publish before the work is ready. Don't you worry. Why can't they wait until I am finished? Now then, my notes. Where are they? Here they are. - Ah, yes. Now then. Nervous? Why should I be? Dr Laurience has been working for some weeks in the Haslewood laboratory. Tonight we are privileged to hear his account of the results he has obtained. Tomorrow they will be published in every organ of the Haslewood press. Tonight it is for you to hear and to judge. I do not propose to stand any longer between you and Dr Laurience. Lord Haslewood, ladies and gentlemen. I bring you a new knowledge of the human mind. A new conception of the relation of mind and body. The experiments that I have described show that .. The mind, the thought content, can be .. Can exist independently. The body is a mere receptacle. Is in fact comparatively unimportant. They also show that I .. That we .. Now have the power to take the mind of one animal. And transfer it into the body of another. After the change the second animal will therefore assume the characteristics .. The fears, the likes and dislikes of the first animal. This I have proved to be a fact. I have been able to take the mind of one chimpanzee and .. And transfer it into the body of another. May I ask a question? If Professor Holloway wishes to ask questions .. He really must wait until the lecture is over. Well. In that case. Are we to understand .. That you are serious in putting forward these views? Entirely. And you seriously maintain that the experiments you describe .. Have actually taken place? I do. Thank you. That is all I wanted to know. If I'm lucky enough to pick up a taxi I can get to Olympia by ten o'clock. I understand the circus there is excellent. Can't you see what you have done with your ridiculous claims? I will go on. You must listen! You fools. You heard what I can do today. Now you shall hear what I can do tomorrow. All that has been done with animals can be done with man. With you. There isn't one of you who can't use what I can give you. Take your minds from your miserable weak bodies. And put them into bodies that are strong and young. Alright. When you lie on your deathbeds I shall laugh and think of all that you refused. You heard what I told them. I shall prove once and for all that I told the truth. I will make the final experiment. This time on myself. You can't do that. Don't forget your promise to follow me without fear. I know. But your own mind? It's sacred. Sacred? Ask them in there. Come on please. Where is Clayton? I am not going to help you. But you must. Without you it is impossible. I know. That is why I am not going to help you. So you too are against me. You know I am not. You don't know what you're doing. Tomorrow, it will all be different. No, it won't be different. The only way to convince them is an experiment on man himself. Then you must work alone. I can't stay with you. You must. We work so well together. We understand each other. Don't you see? I can't work without you. What do you want? You must be perfectly aware of what I want. Lord Haslewood. - Please excuse me. I wish to speak to Dr Laurience. I wish to speak to him alone. Dr Laurience. I am grieved. Deeply grieved at what has occurred. This is a poor reward for the trust I placed in you. It is my painful duty to ask you to leave my institute. You want to turn me out? I have no choice. This is what comes from having anything to do with your filthy newspapers. Please control yourself. I will go on with my work. I will publish my results in my own way. You'll not do that. I hold the copyright and I'll take possession of your papers. I shan't give them up. - You won't be consulted. You signed an agreement. The law will enforce it. You dirty swindler. - Violence won't help you. You think you've beaten me. You and your money. Well, you haven't. You haven't. When I leave here I will take all this with me. On the contrary. It stays here. And tomorrow I shall have it destroyed. I designed it. I built it. With my money at my institute. You've used my name for the sort of quackery that can't deceive a schoolboy. Now you're finished here. And your apparatus is mind to do exactly what I like with. You shan't touch it. I paid for everything. I paid for everything. I paid for everything. The finest laboratory in the world and you sold yourself for it. I'll take possession of your papers. I paid for everything. Tomorrow it will be destroyed. You can't do that. You can't do that. Dr Laurience, do you feel better? Please forgive me. I spoke hastily. I wasn't quite myself. Yes. Perhaps I did claim to do too much. It was foolish of me to try to deceive you. Send me away if you like. Take back everything you have given me. But first I want to show you something. I'm afraid it is quite .. - I only ask you to stay one moment. My time is valuable. - I won't waste it. Please sit down. I'm afraid this is the only chair I have to offer you. You must understand that once my mind is made up .. You will not change it. Perhaps I can do it for you. What's the meaning of this? - A new experiment. And you will be the subject of it. Let me go! You will suffer for this. What are you afraid of? Quackery that wouldn't deceive a schoolboy? But Dr Laurience .. You said so yourself. You are fond of the sound of your own voice. Well, listen to it. This room that you so kindly built for me is entirely soundproof. What are you going to do? You called me a cheat and a charlatan. Now you are going to help in an experiment to prove that I am not. Let him change bodies with you, Clayton. It might be amusing. - It might be dangerous. I have nothing to lose. And his Lordship is bursting with enthusiasm. You can't do it. You can't do it! You can't do it. You can't do it, I tell you. Clayton. Clayton. Formerly the property of the first Baron Haslewood. Not bad. A trifle fat in the usual places. Let us hope that mind will triumph over matter. Walk. Walk? Walk. Don't rush me. I haven't done such a thing for thirty years. Ha. A much-overrated occupation. Haslewood. I wish you'd treat my body with more consideration. After all, you are only the temporary tenant. Temporary? Why temporary? Haslewood came here to throw me out and smash all this. But if you remain Haslewood .. Why not? I don't grudge Haslewood my body. He deserves it. He needn't have it long. I don't have to go on keeping him alive. No, no. It's murder! Exactly, Milord. The perfect murder. Death from natural causes. In the meantime, thanks for the sound body. Dead. That settles it. It settles more than you think. I meant my work to be given to the world. To be used for the common good. But they wouldn't have it. They would not believe me. They laughed at me. Alright. I will keep it to myself. I will use it for myself. And I will use it for my own ends. "Yes?" Cashier? "Good morning, Lord Haslewood." Good morning. I want some money. "Certainly. The usual amount?" Yes. I suppose so. Send it straight up. Better make it double. "Very good, Lord Haslewood." "And my devotion to this great organ." "Is not merely a matter of pounds shillings and pence." "Semicolon." "It is something .. deeper." "Which inspires me as I know it inspires you." "To dedicate my life - capital L." "To its service." From the cashier's office, Milord. Thank you. I think you will find it correct. - I hope so. I hope so. Good morning. This is Thursday, Lord Haslewood. Yes. Of course. Thursday. I take it you were expecting us. Well, not exactly. I hope you aren't thinking of discontinuing these meetings. Most certainly not. Well, what business have we? First and foremost, the Laurience affair. Now in view of last night's unfortunate development .. I took the liberty to tone down the story. Of course we must change the leader. - Why? My leader is on the benefits of science. It would seem a trifle out of place. We may get out of it gracefully if we gave Laurience a nervous breakdown. Good idea. Get his doctor to order him away. - Somewhere remote. I disagree. It is most important that he should continue his experiments. You aren't going on with this man? Most certainly, I am. - The fellow is a charlatan. How do you know? - You told me so last night. Did I? I judged hastily. Let this be a lesson to you. Never judge hastily. But we can't go on. I agree that at the moment, too much publicity will embarrass us all. Particularly myself. But Laurience will continue to work under my protection. By the way, you might arrange for him to have a few extra thousands for expenses. But Lord Haslewood .. - The matter is closed. Nothing more? - Yes there is. You promised us at the last meeting a declaration of policy. Did I? - Isn't that so, Miss Briggs? Why yes, Mr Gray. If Miss Briggs says so .. Are we to continue to press the Prime Minister? Always press the prime minister. And what about the point Mr Gray raised last time? Exactly. My view is unaltered. I don't remember you expressing any view. Mr Gray, if you cannot remember what I told you .. You can hardly expect me to repeat it all now. What about page seven? What about page seven? You promised me a decision today. I pay you to make decisions. You must make up your mind yourself. If you leave it to me .. So you leave Mr Saunders to control page seven? It's not his province. - What can I do? It means an entirely new make-up. Gentlemen. Gentlemen, please. I have never been spoken to like this in my life. What do our private feelings matter? I too have my objections. But my devotion to this great organ is something deeper. Which inspires me as I know it inspires you. To dedicate my life .. with a capital L. To its service. Thank you, gentlemen. That will be all, Miss Briggs. Miss Briggs? - Yes. What is the matter? Why .. That's the first time you have called me 'Miss Briggs' since Ostend. Haslewood. I am afraid I shall have to find out a little more about you. Well, this is the last time I shall go in here. Now don't get sentimental. Hurry up and get your things. Alright. Oh. I didn't know you were still here. What happened last night? I contrived to convince Lord Haslewood of the truth of my theories. You are going on with your work here? On human beings? Not even you can stop that. In that case. You are not going to leave me. This new power. I can share it only with you. For you alone are worthy to receive it. Today I see you clearly for the first time. Now I know why I wanted you to work with me. You know why you have to stay. No. I understand. I am old. But don't you see? With this new power I needn't remain old. I can take a new body, a young body, and keep my own brain. And you too. You won't always be young. When you grow old I can give you a new body. Think of it. I offer you eternal youth. Eternal loveliness. Poor Dick. Laurience was there. You know, he's changed. Something has happened to him. Probably a touch of liver. I told him I was going to marry you. You are? - Uhuh. Yes. I think I am now. 'Educated. Eton and Trinity, Cambridge'. Very gratifying. I am learning a lot about myself. - Please pay attention. If Haslewood is to have a future, he must know his past. 'Married Frances Amelia'. Sounds interesting. No, sorry. She is dead. - Clayton, will you listen to me. Do you realize you're addressing the man who made sixty against Oxford in 1900? I want your son to come here. 'Hobbies. Hard work'. What a pompous ass I am. I want your son to come here. Why? I think it's time I met him. I feel it's time I met him myself. We'll invite him. What is his first name? Good evening, sir. - Evening, Bates. Surprised to see me? - Yes, sir. I'm going to get married and I think father should know. Congratulations, sir. [ Door knocks ] Hello. Yes? Don't look at me like that. I've come for a father's blessing. Oh. Come in, my boy. Delighted to see you. I just phoned you. You are in good form tonight. - Never felt better in my life. Have a cigar? - Thanks. But I am still a non-smoker. Oh yes. Of course. I was thinking of someone else. Oh .. this is Dr Laurience. Evening, doctor. I've heard all about you from my assistant. Yes. That is why I'm here. I want to marry her. Oh. And what would you expect your father to say to that? I wish I knew. What does the doctor say to it? I think you would make a splendid couple. You don't look as though you've had a day's illness in your life. Have you? Not that I remember. Have I? Not that I remember. Hmm. A sound mind in a sound body. I shouldn't be too sure about the mind. Do you play games? Yes. I played rugger at Cambridge. Any rowing? - A little. Your heart stands up to it alright? - What is this? A medical examination? You must excuse me. I am a doctor you know. Well, I think I can safely leave you two to talk over family matters. I must get back. Thinking up some new gadget I suppose? Exactly. I will show it to you sometime. Goodnight. - Goodnight. You and Laurience seem pretty thick these days. He is a brilliant fellow. Have a drink? - Thanks. I hope he's looking after you alright. Me? Why me? That is what he is here for, isn't it? Hmm. Remember what Dr Thornhill told you. Yes. Of course. Is the heart still bumping? Yes. I suppose so. You are taking that stuff he gave you? - Yes, yes. Well, take care of yourself. I am in no hurry to inherit the title. I am in no hurry to part with it. You don't think I'm looking any worse, do you? No. Perhaps I have been overdoing it bit lately. Hey, what about that? I thought all alcohol was strictly forbidden. Yes. I thought the occasion called for a drink. That reminds me. I've a date with Clare. I mustn't keep her waiting. Goodnight, father. - Goodnight, my boy. I don't blame you for breaking out but take it easy. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Hello. - Hello. I hope I'm not late. Exactly nine and a half minutes. I shall be a quarter of an hour. Sit down. I'm busy. I dropped in on the way to break the news to my dear father. You left peaceably or were you assisted? Most peaceably. He was full of fun. In fact, he gave us his blessing. That's a bit of a change isn't it? For him, I mean. A change? Why, he was a different person. What do you mean? Well, he's never exactly fawned on me. We've lived mostly in splendid isolation. But tonight he was quite human. Was .. was Laurience there? Yes. He is a queer fellow. Father and he seem as thick as thieves. When I arrived I thought I was for it. The old man looked at as if he had never seen me before. But he soon came round. Did you notice anything else queer? Now you mention it .. He was spreading himself a bit doing all the things the doctor told him not to. He wasn't worrying about his heart at all until I reminded him. What is the matter? Do you mind if we don't go out tonight? Why ever not? Please don't ask me now. I will tell you later. What on earth is the matter? - Darling. I want you to go. One thing I must find out. It may be nothing. But Clare .. - Please, Dick. You must trust me. Of course I trust you. I am dreadfully sorry, darling. I'll explain everything later. You will have to. Will you get me a taxi please. I knew you would come back. - I want to ask you something. Anything wrong? What's happened to Lord Haslewood? So far as I know, nothing. What have you done to him? - I don't understand. He is your friend now. - Why not? After Clayton died. Clayton? It was only a matter of time. So Clayton died? I am afraid so. And now Haslewood is your friend. I don't see the point. Do you think I don't realize what you've done? Just what have I done? You always believed you could exchange human minds. I still do. - Because you've done it. With Clayton and Haslewood. - You can't be serious. Why did Clayton die? His was a hopeless case. You know that as well as I do. You could have kept him alive. Well .. yes. I'll tell you the truth. When you left me you made it impossible for me to experiment on myself. Clayton was an incurable invalid. Tired of life. You used him? Yes. - Him alone? And he died. I'm afraid the shock was too great for him. Dicks says his father has changed. A different man. I was there myself. I saw nothing unusual. I prefer to believe his own son. You are not easy to convince. - No. How can anyone prove if you're right or wrong? After all, Haslewood is here. Physically and mentally. Mentally? - Of course. Tomorrow, I'm going to see Haslewood and I'm taking Dick too. If he is Clayton .. - Do you still suspect me? I do. - And this is a test? It is. - Let me tell you .. There's no need. Tomorrow I shall find out. Tomorrow. There you are, Clayton. I've been looking for you. Now this is important. I want you to .. What's the matter? You look like you've seen a ghost. I have. My own. - What do you mean? You remember how Haslewood laughed in my body before he died? Well? I found out why. It was in my dressing room. A heart disorder? Yes. Haslewood knew. That is why he laughed. Probably the only joke he ever saw in his life. From my crippled body to Haslewood's diseased body. From the frying pan into the fire. You must do another experiment only this time give me a sound body. Whose? - His son's. My son. Dick Haslewood. What? I have it all worked out. Yes. Haslewood's Will leaving everything to Dick. I shall inherit my own fortune. Rather pretty, eh? We have only to get him to the Institute and you can do the rest. Yes. I can do the rest. A big story? It will have to be to get me out at this hour. Alright. If it's as important as all that. I'll come down to the Institute right away. He's coming? The journalistic instinct. He gets it from me. So come along. You'll need time. What are you waiting for? - We're not going. Why? I shall not perform an experiment on you. Why not? - It doesn't suit me. Don't be temperamental and do not think I'm threatening you. But I'm in rather a strong position thanks to you. As Haslewood, I own the place you work in. I pay for your food, your cigarettes. Everything. You absolutely depend on me. And having been a cripple for thirty years I have rather a nasty nature. A word from me and you will be discredited. A 'charlatan'. I know you don't like the word. But we wouldn't mince matters in the Haslewood press. Where would you go then? Back to Genoa? So, all things considered. I think we will go to the laboratory. I shall go but you will not. No? Why not? Because you won't take part in this experiment. Because you will be dead. There is no further need for you. Thanks to you, the boy is on his way to the Institute. Where I will take his body and he will take mine. A body that will be hanged for murder. You rang sir? - Yes. Please do not disturb Lord Haslewood for the moment. Very good, sir. His hot milk at the usual time? At the usual time. Excuse me, officer. Could you tell me the time? About ten before ten, sir. Thank you. It's a nice night, isn't it. - Yes, sir. Goodnight. Goodnight, sir. Hello? Will you get me Wellbeck 3677. Goodnight, Jimmy. - Goodnight, sir. Haslewood Institute. I'm sorry I am a bit early sir, but .. Give me the police. Goodnight. Hello. Is my father here yet? Come in. He will be here directly. What's this new story he's after? He will tell you that himself. A cigarette? - No thanks. Oh, I forgot. You don't smoke, do you. Is that the new gadget you were talking about? Yes. Let me show you. Now, suppose I'm experimenting on two animals. These show how the experiment is progressing. The mind of one slowly filtering into the mind of the other. It's all rather beyond me. - Yes. I suppose it is. What are these for? They are to measure the beat of the animal's heart. I have to watch that, you know. I am sorry for the animals. - One is always sorry for the animals. So you see, when I want to work the controls automatically I use this. And it works by itself. That is clever. I can't imagine how you people ever think of these things. When one has a purpose .. It makes all the difference. [ Telephone ] Hello? Do you know where Mr Haslewood is? He has gone out. To the Haslewood Institute. What are you doing? Let me out of this. Not yet. I need something first. Don't you see? I will take your body. Your name. And Clare. And you? You take mine. The body of the man who will be hung for murder. The body of the man who killed Haslewood. Killed? I killed him in his study an hour ago. And I left plenty of evidence to prove that Laurience is the murderer. But by the time the police get here .. You will be Laurience. Let me out. Let me out of this! Let me out. Let me out! Dick. Dick. Thank god you are safe. I thought .. You. Where is Dick? What have you done with him? Where is he? Dick! See who that is. [ Door knocks ] There he is. Make way please. Make way. How is he? There is no hope. How long will it be? A matter of minutes. But it's not Laurience. Laurience is up there. Don't you see? He's done what he said he could. Then .. This is? Dick Haslewood. But he is dying. He is dying. Better get a statement if we can. - Go along with him to the hospital. Listen. I have watched Laurience. I could do the experiment. Undo what he has done. - There isn't time. There is a chance. There must be a chance. We must get him in there. Sorry, Miss. We're taking him to hospital. He's under arrest. He killed Lord Haslewood. Get him into the ambulance. You must help me. You must, you must. I am from the hospital. I take full responsibility. I'm sorry, sir. - But I am a doctor. Immediate treatment here may save a man's life. Will you give me 20 minutes? Alright. 20 minutes. Go on. Alright. Turn on the oxygen. The heart is failing. Be quick. He is sinking. Clare. Clare. Please forgive me. You were right. The human mind is sacred. I want you to .. Promise me something. Destroy all this. This power is .. Too dangerous. Promise me. I promise. Strange. Strange, that only in death .. I should be believed. ..w-g..
