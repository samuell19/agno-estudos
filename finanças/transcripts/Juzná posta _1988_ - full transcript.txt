THE SLOVAK FILM DISTRIBUTION presents We are interested in the opinions of those who are similar to us. Based on Ladislav Ballek's story THE SOUTHERN MAIL Has an El Hubeishi, an old Arab, used to sit in front of his inn, looking at the sun, smoking a water pipe, and listening to hear a sound from the incense clock that he inherited from his ancestors. Screenplay by: Genie... The clock always attracted attention at the inn. It had been silent for months. But suddenly, it revived and exhaled coloured clouds of strange scents from its golden pipes. Here you are. You are still a small boy, Jan. You like many things because you don't know them. When you grow up, you will set out on many roads. We evacuated the hospital. What a smell! We're burying the war. But don't start on a journey that would fill you with fear and anxiety, and curiosity stronger than fear. Don't set out on that journey! - What journey? - A journey of temptation for distances See, I left. -Why? -I don't even know. I knew it and I did the wrong thing. I spent my life somewhere else. See the incense clock? It was a present from my father. Do you like it? For a long time I kept it locked in the suitcase, to escape its smell that would call me to set out on the journey and go back home. - Do you know where Baghdad is? -I don't. It is my native town. I should have respected the clock. What did you come here for? To keep order? To watch the border? The border? The border from what year? Do you like it? I am here, in a foreign land. I don't have my ancestors' experience. Take it. You may find it useful some day. I forgot where it came from. I've lost my way home. I've lost everything, I've even lost myself. I changed completely. Directed by: Suddenly, the mast cracked and broke. A huge wave washed Sindbad into the sea. That's enough, it's time for bed. Stories like that make him scared. - What happened? - He died. Sindbad couldn't die! Kazan, quiet! What's wrong with the dog? Stay where you are, or I'll kill you! Halt! - What's wrong, Paul? - Close the door! -What is it? - Close the door! Go back to where you came from, officer! Go or you'll die, damn alien! Paul, don't go there! Who was it daddy? Was it a bear? Nobody. Just the wind. Go to bed. I know it wasn't the wind. We shouldn't have come here. Come on... - We move too often. - My job moves. The war is over, the border shifted. We moved when it didn't, too. Some people can't manage. This is our seventh place! - The seventh? - Yes. You wouldn't stay anywhere. Not at home, either. I guess I could not find a reason to stay. It may be wrong. If you can't stay at home, you won't stay anywhere. And what about the children? Watch out, you'll fall down! What did he want? Gonda. Always on time. I saw Gonda's wife with Kovac again. You should have a talk with him. What for? She won't change and he'll suffer even more. What a life! Good morning, Mr. Jurkovic. Caba, have them lined up! Line up! Come on. I have the silver. Good morning! I have some white wool for your wife. I want to talk to you. Tell your husband to stop, or he'll be sorry. He's not a smuggler, I told you. He smuggles carpets, food, bicycles, fabric. The other day even a horse! The horse went by itself. It happens. Here you are. By itself. Straight to Janos Pal's stable. Take one, it's sweet. - He smuggles also medicine. - What medicine? He deals it. Gyula, what are you doing there? Go play in the sun! But we have nothing. The business is bad. We will end up as beggars. I am a custom officer and your husband a smuggler. His actions are against the interest of the state. I'm warning you. I'm sorry for your boys. He carries a knife attached to his stick. That's not true! You know it is! He's dangerous. Tell him he will pay for it! Why are the workers guarded? They are prisoners. - What did they do? - It depends. Some of them deserted from the army, others were soldiers of the enemy... - Why are they locked up? - They wait for the trial. Wait here. Let's go! Smugglers? Why didn't we catch them? I am not on duty. Hold tight! Mr. Gonda is waiting for you. Not a word to uncle Gonda. Good morning! It's so hot! Tell me about it. - Where have you been? - To see Kovac's wife. - What did she say? - Nothing. It doesn't lead anywhere. - He won't give it up. -gon I see. Do you think she'll tell him? Perhaps. Justice is peculiar, when it is done out of duty. No wonder the don't like us. - Here you are. - Thanks. Listen: Terrorists in action. This month the National Security Forces District Headquarters was blown up at Tornal. It was probably an attack by the Nyulasi groups who are campaigning among the Hungarian part of the population against the Czechoslovak Republic. Kovac makes my blood boil. Where is he crossing the border? People say we take our share from it. Hello! I brought you lunch. I thought you forgot. I could't come earlier. It isn't hot here. Let me see. What's that? I was in a hurry, I came across the corn field. How are you? Oh, you don't like me? Dad and I came across the corn field, too. Bring water! Save the horses! It's too late even for a miracle! The Nyulasi band had their ammunition stored in there. Suddenly, it blew up. Daddy, will the horses burn? No, don't worry. Look! When the Peking palace was burning, the flames reached up to the roof of the world. Tragedies are not moving anymore. Conscience dies first in war. I warned him against them. It's a shame about the wine! At least we're not bored! The Berlin Waltz. It came hers on the night the inn burnt down. We saw him on the tree. We thought it was Genie, the Baghdad caliph's carrier pigeon. He carried important news, but he got confused by the flames. He radiates like fire. It must be Genie. He carried a secret message for the caliph. He will fly away again. No he won't! You wanted to exchange him for something, right? You could get a fishing rod for him. I don't want a fishing rod! Nothing ever happens here, except for houses burning down. The same boring days over and over. I don't want children yet. I wish my husband weren't such a sad-sack. But he... The sleeve. We should have moved to a big city. I don't know what we are doing here. There's nothing but criminals and corn. It's good I learned French. He came here because of me. You're so stupid! -No, I'm not! -Yes, you are! I can read. -It's of no use to you. - Yes, it is! You should set him free. It's a genie, isn't he? Changed into a pigeon. He lost his way when he carried a message to Baghdad. Mr. Jurkovic! They are on the line! Coming! Ready! Be careful! I'll let you out. But you'd beter get accustomed here. My name is Jan Jurkovic, my brother's name is Paul. Beware of him. My mom and dad live here too, you don't need to be afraid of them. I'll tell them I love you. Halt! Go to the right! Let's take a short cut! Give me that! Let it go! Nothing? They're gone. Without the deg again? What are you doing here? I can sell everything here. People are dumb, they buy any piece of junk. Welcome! Quite a chick, isn't she? I have one like her everyday. Do you like her? I saw two men looking for peculiar people for their circus. I'm a Chinese Jew, they don't have anybody like that. Guess how much they'd pay. -A lot. - And even more. - And you didn't go. -What would I do there? I have horses. You haven't seen better ones. They speak in human tongue at night. I can send them to buy tobacco. You don't believe me? Do they let you come to see me? Yes. - Where's your father? - At the customs-house. Stay here! Chasing smugglers, huh? Comfortable? - What's in the box? - A pigeon. A carrier pigeon? Don't worry, I won't take it. I prefer horses. Go! Hurry up, little customs officer! Eat, damn you! Don't want? Don't tell me again you're hungry. I won't send you for tobacco again. Don't listen to him. He'll teach you nothing good. Let me be! I found the boy at the post-office today, he ran away again. - What did he do there? - I don't know. To bed, come on! You're running away, Paul is too... - Good night! - Now him. All men are running off. Don't worry, he'll stop somewhere. What for? He's my friend. He's shown her to me himself. Climb! Show us that we man of yours! And what about me? Let's drink to the new republic! We were Slovaks, then Hungarians, now Slovaks again. It doesn't get better than this. -I want to have a look too. - Quiet! Nothing for you! You watch your pigeon! Gentlemen, we got visitors! Change of guards? No need! Here you are! You too, little customs officer? They got scared, you take it all. Eat! What's your name? Jurkovic. I'm count Michael Charles Mandarin, son of Charles Michael Mandarin. Jan Jurkovie, son of Paul Jurkovic. Is that a pigeon? Lot me see! Okay. The Berlin Waltz! Where did you get him? -He's flown to me. - By himself? Do you want to be a postman? I saw you locking at the horses. My grandpa was a postman. It's a pity he died. I wanted to be an organist. If I didn't have to be a count, I would be an organist. Sit down. Can you play? I can, but only when there is nobody to see me. Otherwise, I would forget how to play. You don't ask why do I want to be an organist? Why? When are there the most people at church? - On holidays. - That's right. How many people are there? Full church. Full church. They are pushing, you can hardly move in the crowd. They kneel down, even the children. And then they stand up. The priest is standing, the altar boys are standing, the rich and the poor, the healthy and the ill, the pharmacist and the officer, everybody but the organist. He is sitting. The only one. And he even sings. The organist plays and sings. That's something! Play and sing. So late for lunch? Who doesn't come on time, needn't come at all. Who's the man living in the house with the goat? They call him Count Mandarin. -How do you know him? - He played music for me. He's ill. People say a grenade exploded near him. Everything got confused in his head. Go eat your lunch now. Have a look, quick! So beautiful! You can have my fishing rod and two hooks if you give him to me. - Where are you going? -I'll be right back. Stay in today! We are new here, they could do something to you. Let's go! Did you see my brother? Leave me alone, little bastard! Didn't I tell you? Paul sold the pigeon many times. The children believed it was born from the fire of the desert. Gyula, the ill son of the smuggler Kovac, really wanted to have the pigeon. Gyula, go out! Well, doctor? It is serious. Mr Kovac? And ... I know. I'll get the medicine as always. I'll try to do something. - Have you found Genie? - Not yet. What a pity. - What's wrong with you? - Nothing. Shall we go to Hassan's inn? What are they building? A memorial to Russian soldiers. Come. Don't you want to? Stop dreaming. Hello. Do you still have the key? I do. Have you found where it fits? Maybe you were looking at the wrong place. You must be patient. What's wrong? Did Paul sell your pigeon? He has two owners and you both love him. I love Genie, he doesn't! I thought you'd find an agreement. I'd like to be a grown-up. Who are they? Smugglers. Are you afraid? No. I need to pee. Come on then. Go ahead! How are you? People say that smuggling is spreading around here. Why do you do it? I've lived here all my life. My father and grandfather lived here, too. I don't believe in borders, you just make them up! Without a border you couldn't smuggle. The frontier gives meaning to everything. You know that. Nobody would pay for the smuggled goods. Let's go, Jan. You wouldn't be here, either! Genie! Where are you? The pigeon was gone for a long time. I feared that I would never see him again. I was looking for him everywhere. Paul, where did you take him? - He flew away. -You're lying! Didn't you say he would fly away to Baghdad? But you sold him. I didn't. The pigeon could not open the door! But he is a genie. I hate you! Was it worth it? Is he here in town? Where else? Paul, send him home. Go and tell mom! Magda, wait! Let me be! What did you do to me? But my son is dying! Will he get well if you leave me? All that talk about how free and happy we are! Not even death will part us! Death is just coming. That's our punishment! An act of God! Pray with your wife, and Gyula will be healed! My children are none of your business! This was too much! I don't know what I'm doing. I need you! Yes, for finding out when is my hush and on duty. I let you fool me... I want you! Don't you understand? I'm done with you! Go to her and your cute little kids! There are other men around! It's not a place for you! Rex, over here! - Hurry up, Bodnar's waiting! - Be careful with him! Want to try some tobacco? Strong. Hello! Little officer! - Want to go for a ride? - No. Still angry? I get nasty with everybody sometimes. If you forgive me, you're a man. Come! This too. Hurry up. Have you forgiven me? You'll grow up to be a man like your father. I heard that the Germans wanted to shoot him. Only great men can forgive. I'd have to beat up many if I couldn't forgive. I can't always be tough. But nobody forgives me. People don't like strong men. They like weaklings. They're scared of me, so they slender and pick on me. Who doesn't forgive you? Nobody forgives me. Even that chicken. It's not my fault his old lady fancies me. When she saw me she almost threw herself at me. Good afternoon. Enjoy your meal! You know where females have their brains? -I don't. -In their panties. Had enough? A man falls on his head, but a woman on her bottom. Everybody where their brains are. You're home. Hurry up, it's going to rain. See you, uncle Bodnar! Bye! Ginie! Have you come back? You're back? You do love me, don't you? I won't let you go again! We'll stay together. Does it hurt? Who did this to you? They didn't want you to come back. Mom, come and hide! They are looking for the rebels. Oh my God! The Germans shot Vlado. Then they went to the custom-house. They got them all. Faster! Why did you want to fire? It was my duty. It's our border. - What are you doing here? - Looking. Has Genie come back? You see! And you were so worried. I knew he'd come back. Why did they beat you? When? When Celar was shot. He's got fever. He's all wet! Come. I'll never sell him again. Jan! Go out! You'll sleep in the kitchen. Did he fall asleep? He's delirious. It's the pigeon. He worried too much. Genie, where are you? We'd better call the doctor. A man must go through hard times. It makes him grow up. Take a deep breath. Cough. Don't cough. He can get dressed. He needs penicillin. I don't know if you can get any... But you should. At all costs. Doctor, tell me honestly, is he getting better? Unfortunately, he's not. Hey, Jan Jurkovic! Are you better now? Come to the meadow to listen to music! The goat is the best cow. She gives milk and takes up little space. Jan! We're next! On the sun, there live some mysterious beings. They are almost like humans. They must be hot, living in fire. Who told you that? The sun is made of fire. I know, I get news. They won't burn! Everything burns in fire. I've seen it. -You give up? - Yeah. Do you know who is a missionary? He teaches people in Africa how to pray. The people on the sun live like the missionaries in Africa. When the wild beasts leave the jungle at night, the missionaries make a circle of fire. They make a wooden fence around them on a clearing and set it on fire at night. - Do you think they burn? - Guess they don't. Of course, they don't. I know! The sun burns like a band of fire and there's a clearing within. Not just a clearing, a large piece of land, where the right ones live and guard the blue powder. Do they have enough of it? Don't worry, they have enough for the whole globe. Soon they will fly down here and spread the powder on us. We will fall asleep. They'll examine us. They will look everybody in the soul, and never wake those with guilt. The war has taken his sanity. Nobody where he had come from or what was his name. He turned up in the town after the war. He is said to be a count, but nobody knew his descent. Some people said he was an officer and only pretended to be mad, others said he was a postman who survived an air-raid. He spoke four languages and was brilliant at numbers. Get off! - What do you want? - You know me... We need to get to the Horse Farm. Put that knife away! Okay, I'll make room in the back. They won't find you there. Come! What's wrong? You dirty bastard! Uncle Michal, what happened? Are you all right? Here they come. Let's get away! Zigmund Bodnar, the sailor. Nothing bothered him. He kicked a ship into the sea, he lifted a cannon, he walked the equator barefooted, and did not fall into the sea once! People admired him but started to avoid him after he handed the refugees over to the police. One of them pulled a knife! He thought I'd get scared. The other one begged me to take them to the Horse Farm. Everybody knew some prisoners were forced to fight in the war. I'm not their driver! Gonda condemned him the most. Maybe because he himself needed help. People in my age should have children. Children are the only thing we leave behind. But she wouldn't hear about it. You are too good to her. A woman needs strict treatment. Maybe I'm too old for her. I don't know! They paid me too! Has an, I'm inviting everybody for a drink! This is a good card! Come on! - What does the swine say? - Sit down! Decent people don't gain from other people's misery. Let's find an agreement. I am not a bad person. Is the seat taken? Yes. We are in the middle of an important conversation. You are so very important! Think a little! Leave! Stop bothering respectable people! Well? Didn't you hear? Respectable people... You'd better take care of your respectable wife! How dare you? An officer is teaching her how to swim. What officer? No idea. You can still make it to there. Look, he's found her. What are you doing? That is the way to swim. You go too! Let go! Why did you come then? No, let me be! You...! What the hell does this fool want? Look at the beauty in my pants! I Kill ...! They didn't see... Joseph! What happened? Was there an alarm? Joseph! What is it? - Give it to me! - No! Have you gone mad? I'll kill her! Are you mad? 'I kill her and myself. You work the morning shift tomorrow. Don't forget. You'll feel better when you sleep on it. Ginie! Quick! My brother saw me! Stop! Watch out for the little guy! Get out of here, boys! Janko! You promised not to sell Genie again! Let me be! Give him to me! Piss off! We bought him! You mad dog! What did you say? He's my brother! Bela, punch him! Stop it! Why don't you leave him alone? Eat your pigeon! Paul, catch him! Come, Gyula! Give him to me, please. - Was there an alarm at night? -No, why? Uncle Gonda didn't come home. Our daddy either. If you don't feel well, go home. I'm okay. That's me and daddy in the cornfield and those are the smugglers. Nice... Why is uncle Gonda sad? It happens sometimes. You were sad, too. Remember? - Want a biscuit? - No. Have a good time! All the best! Everything is okay! What time is it? Are you ill? Give this to your dad. I saw aunt Gondova in the morning. What an idea! You know why! Joseph, come down! Hell, where are the firemen? I'll be right back! If he knew everything, he'd done it already. He will fly. Do you want everybody to feel sorry for you? Jump then, go ahead! Kovac! I'll teach you a lesson! What a show for a customs officer. Gyula, come on home! There are so many of them! Joseph, for heaven's sake, don't! Everything will be okay! Do you hear me? Hurry up with the sheet! Now she loves him. She was lucky to have a man like that. You are the only one I love! What are you staring at? Do something! Come here! Joseph, come down! There's no point! Leave me alone! You must get aver it. She has always cheated on me. She never loved me. Take a cigarette! Just a moment! No need. Don't do it! You would do it because of me? Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Wait, the chief wants to jump, too! Would you like to fly? I can fly. But only at night, so that nobody could see me. Really? Come, I'll show you something. - Here it is. - What? The water clock. I'll show you. Nobody knows about it. The water is dropping. I could feel it. Because we are from water. Only water... My God, it is dropping. You must leave! Run! I knew it was dropping! If you see it dropping, run! Do you have a headache? Did you hit your head? No. - Have you cut yourself? -I haven't, run home! Why the bandage? My brain is growing, I am getting wiser. I count quicker and quicker. I don't want my head to crack. Go home! - Can you smell it? - Strange scent. It comes from a great distance, maybe from as far as the sea. Everything smells so strong here. - Will she change? -Who? Gonda's wife. It was no ordinary frog, it was a princess. It changed into a beautiful woman at midnight. Nonsense! Wait, maybe it'll change! I'm going to bed. I don't think it's her. Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe it is. Let's go! Sit! We caught them near the Horse Farm. Who were you carrying the goods for? Who for? For ourselves, for personal use. For personal use? Yeah, right. Was Kovach with you? Is it for him? Can't you speak? As you wish. The police won't be very friendly. - Those are smugglers. - They're killers, too. - Dad isn't afraid of them. - Go home. Who'll be the first? We'll pay the fine. Jurkovic! What are you doing here? Show me the pigeon. You know it isn't for sale. Does he really deliver messages? They say so. - Messages about death too? - Maybe. Sell him. I have money. He's not for sale! - How much would you give? -A lot! - Don't dare! - Little baby! Don't fight! I have money! My brother wants to keep him. Wait! - Look how much I have! -Where did you get it? Dad gave it to me. I came back from a sanatorium. My lungs are ill. I want to buy him, please. No. Take your money. Please! At least show him how he flies. With a mirror? Where's the genie? Over there! Show me how he flies. Okay. He's flying, look! - Did we do them any wrong? - No, nothing. Are you afraid? They're from the camp. They're friends with the men I got arrested. Hold tight! Don't worry, you're with me! Shit! Hold tight! Are you all right? I'm fine. Bastards! They'll pay dear for that! Are you hurt? No. You'll ride on horse-back. We can make it by midnight. Come on! Let me see it! I don't want to see you with Bodnar again! You have strange friends. One is a traitor, the other a fool. What are you talking about? Uncle Michael is not a fool. He counts the most quickly in the world. - He is strange. -But he is good. - Have a drink. -I don't want any. I'm going to bed. The summer was coming to its end, the last victorious troops were leaving towards their home in the east. The corn fields near the border were thinner every day. The smugglers knew their time was almost up. Father had more work. - Where are they going? - Home. Why do you like Bodnar? He says he could hold a ship in his teeth. Thy wanted him for a museum as a Chinese Jew. Do you believe him? - Do you think he's lying? -I don't know. Dad, there's somebody out there. - Where? - Over there. Stay here. Shit! Daddy! Don't shout! I'll give you my watch. Dad! Little brat! Has he hurt you? Are you sure it was Kovac? The boy saw him. He crosses even by day now. He lost something. Penicillin? His son needs it. The doctor said he would die if he doesn't take it. Hello! Joseph, can I talk to you? - May I? - Okay. Want a peach? Here you are. You are such a big boy now... I saw the doctor. - And? -Well ... Don't be nervous. Dear fellow citizens! Let me welcome you to the ceremony... Sorry, I'm no good at speeches... On this day of peace... -I was looking for you. - Dad is waving! I have to tell you something. The pigeon is not for sale. - What do you want for him? -I won't give him for the world. I am not going to live much longer. - It will be yours then. -Sorry, I can't. Take it with you. We are agreed, aren't we? We're in a hurry, we transport dry ice. We'll carry nothing on the way back. Lift the tilt. Legally this time? Here you are. Careful, it's burning and evaporates fast. They're good. Cover it up! Everything is okay. Big... Uncle Michael! What's wrong? Can you hear me? Are you alive? Uncle Michael! Milk the goat. I can't... Amor, quiet! What a life! Everybody in bed, and we are chasing smugglers! Somebody has to do it. A state cannot exist without law. My father wanted me to be a priest. You wouldn't be expecting a son then. Magda and I should move. Some place where nobody knows us. It was so stupid of me to want to jump... Down! One mustn't give up. If he respects himself, everything will change. We'll move and start all over. I must be able to make it. I'll have a vineyard, I'll watch it grow. There he is! Let's go! You go over there! Halt! Amor! Bastard! My God! Joseph! How do you know it was Kovac? I'm sure. -I've got to prove it. - He could've killed you too. He could. Maybe he thought it was me. He'll not buy the vineyard. What? He wanted to move away. We long for something all our lives, and suddenly we die, and everything's over. Have you really flown here because of me? He is very ill. You won't be sad without me, will you? His name is Gyula. He will love you. Uncle Michael ... Wait! - Uncle Michael! -It's good you came. Remember, we are from water. We are from water, Clouds, rivers, seas, oceans! We pass from eternity to eternity. We are afraid of fire because we are from water! But what would we do without fire? We are from water, that's why we shall meet again. We'll meet again. - What do you want? -I want to see Gyula. Peace to this house. Let this holy water reminds us of the baptism of Jesus Christ, Our Lord and Saviour. Let us confess our sins... Let's wait for the priest to leave. It is a sad thing. Genie. I have brought Genie. What for? Gyula is going to die. Let's go! Wait a minute! I wanted to give him Genie. I thought he would get well. I know. So does he. - He doesn't. - Yes, he does, stop crying! Don't cry. He won't come back! I set him free. He must stay with those who need him the most. Gyula needs him now. Life and death have no end. I was little, and then suddenly grown up. I left behind a border of time, where it is not possible to return. A real border. Unlike those that change all the time, and one can cross them. An invisible border of time. The Southern Mail
