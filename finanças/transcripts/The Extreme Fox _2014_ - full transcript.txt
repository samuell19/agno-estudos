Foxes have different ranks such as fairy fox, celestial fox, ethereal fox, nine-tailed fox... And the so-called millennium white, eternity black and nine-tailed black fox, are the top of the fox spirits... Fox, fox, fox, I can't stand it! Wang Sheng, what did you say? How do you know my name? "Wang Sheng" Even a blind like me can see such huge characters. Moreover, you are from Liuxian Village, the only son in your family, right? Yes, how do you know that? Is it written here? Don't bother with him. Go on. No one knows there are also kindhearted foxes in the world. They are so transcendent and eager to become fairies. But... even I were a fox spirit, I would not touch a hopeless hoodoo like you. Then I am not so hopeless as you said. As for the fox spirit, something strange happened in the royal palace... It's heard that General Wu Zhen is a top martial art master. He is very ambitious and in control of the armed forces. For the throne's safety, the Emperor decides to marry his only daughter to him. Princess is coming! General is staying secluded, no one is allowed to get in, go away! On the wedding night, Princess was abducted by the fox spirit. Brother Qian, I just came back from the capital, but I've never heard such news. Don't chop in! Believe it or not, it just happened. And I... Since then, people turn pale at the mere mention of fox, and think wearing fox protector can save them. Handsome boy, your chicken and wine. But I didn't order any, I just ordered a cup of tea. Never mind, this is my treat. Thank you, but I will pay you back. I won't sell my body for this chicken. Then take your time. Drink more. Wang Sheng, do you believe there are fox spirits in this world? Of course I do. But thereby hangs a tale... That's right. For safety's sake, you'd better not go home. Anyway, you have left home so long, and all alone by yourself, it doesn't matter if you go back or not. Ambitious man aims far. No, I miss my home because I left so long. Didn't you hear "east or west, home is the best"? Even if I die, I prefer to die at home. Ok, I won't stop you if you want to die. Sorry, excuse me. Your Royal Highness. Is there any good news about Princess? Your Royal Highness, I have locked on the Liuxian Village, it will be cleared up soon. My health is getting worse. You must find princess and get married. Yes, your Royal Highness. If you like it, I will have it sent to General's Mansion. Thank you, your Royal Highness! Coming, the odd-job men's coming! Welcome. Why so happy? "Liuxian Village" Sir... There is a Top Scholar in our village, how can't we be overjoyed? Where is the Top Scholar? I shall meet... Not here yet, don't you come here to inform the news? Attention! We are ordered by General Wu Zhen to investigate the fox spirits here. You must report to us immediately if you see anything suspicious. Anyone who tries to conceal will be shot on sight! Brother, the fox spirit won't be interested in this poor village. - No, but... - What are you doing! You two! You are all suspicious. Get them all and torture! Help, have mercy, sir! Please understand, sir. No problem, they are all clear. All right. Good bye, sir. Go. Firecrackers! Send out the misery! Hi, everyone. - Is there a party? - Sheng! I go home to change my clothes, - and will be back soon! - Sheng! - Sheng, - Mayor. We are all waiting for you. - Why do you come back so late? - Yes, yes. We finally can live a good live! Indeed... Mayor, please let go. Listen to me. Sorry, I am too excited I should say sorry to you, - at the last gasp, I... - Failed? Bingo! You are almighty! You are really infuriating! Son, we bet on the wrong person. You should take the imperial examination when you grow up. - It'd better depend on ourselves. - Yes, mum. Mrs Zhou, I will try my best to repay you... Sheng, I am not disappointed, but desperate. Right? You took the exam three times, and failed three times. You said others rely on pulling strings. Ok, it's fine. But this time, the whole village raised money and exploited connections for you. There's no excuse that... Ah, your narcolepsy attacks again? Can anything be done about it? Sheng, go to sleep at my home. Your home? Yes, look at this weary face, look at this rough hand. No, thanks. Mayor, see you. Look out yourself. I guess why Mayor acts so confidentially, he redecorated my ancestral house? Wah, it's full of corpses! He turned my house into a morgue! Now I know why he prevented me from home! I will strip your skin off if I catch you! Dare you come back? Fur? Nice scent. Did I smell it somewhere before? Oh, I can't stand it. But I will be ok with you. Where's my pillow? "The tomb of Xianglian" Why am I here? Is my illness getting worse? Drowsiness with sleep walking. Sorry, sorry, it's my fault. Wah, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four. You don't want to get up? I am hungry, I eat first. Chicken combo! I just eat before you, don't need to be so angry. Hey, hey, so it was mouse. Again? You have drunk half bucket of footbath water, you are going to drink more? Dude, take it easy. Don't be intoxicated in Xianer's footbath water. That is a mistake caused at a wrong time, a wrong place and by a right person. She has paid 20 thousand dollars to rent your house. 20 thousand can save many people. It's ok for her to rent the house. But the problem is the money can buy several houses like this, so why did she rent it? Don't you think there's something strange? She is rich and beautiful, is there any problem? Do you have any problem? No problem. Then what is your problem? Even if you are running a morgue, how can you make profit? It obviously would not pay. If that is not a problem, then you have some problems I like here, remote and quiet. So I don't think the price is a problem? I still have problems. You don't need to raise your hand. What? I cannot share the house with her. You must move away. Ok, then pay me back the 20 thousand dollars, I will go immediately. I have no problem to live in Mayor's home. Then I will have a problem. Money is not the problem, but no money is a problem. I owe you, ok? No. It's you who should move. Why? This is my house, If I die, I must die here! You two. Calm down, let's... talk about it I think you are liars. You promised everything at first, and now you say that owners is back, and could not repay my money. It's obviously being a hoax. Please don't mistake. I am an old loser and he is a young bachelor, how can we cheat your money? I don't care whether you are a young bachelor or an old loser. I warn you, I am not an easy-going person! Who scared? Xianer, Xianer, don't be angry. Mayor, who is she? Not human, and not fox, do you believe? Where are the dead? If you don't go, you will die miserable. I tell you, no matter how miserable, I will die here. Then you just wait and die here. Who scared! You must be hungry. I am hungry. What do you want? Freshly roasted chicken, still hot. Is it edible? Chances won't come twice. I count one, two, three. If you don't want to turn into skeleton, go away immediately. Look at your stupid face. Lose sleep when I sleepy, fall asleep when I don't want to. Who scared! Who scared! Don't run! Where are you! Come out! Hey, come out! Who scared! Who scared! I am not afraid of you. Don't run about aimlessly. Hurry up if you don't want to be like me. Keep away from me. "Salted duck egg" I have millennium duck's egg with me. I am not afraid of you. I was forced to. It's not too late yet. Hurry up. - Go, go away! - Go away... Go away! He is innocent! Please let him go! Keep away. I am not scared. I have millennium duck's egg. Way to go. You don't fear? Eat your egg. Again? Help! It's dawn. Who... who are you? Isn't that asking the question knowingly? You are lucky this time. Run away as soon as possible. What is this temple? Thank you for your mercy, almighty Fox Spirit. You have helped us a lot since you came here. Now I beg you to forgive Wang Sheng. And the most important thing is, please keep on supporting me and my village 50 pounds of salt, 10 pounds of sunflower seeds, 30 pints of fine vinegar, 200 pounds of pumpkins and 1000 ounces of gold. It went too far. Forget it... Just so ugly, now... so beautiful? So, so terrible! Huh? Do you want to see more? I can turn into many things. No, no, thanks. It is too exciting for me! I am warning you, don't follow me anymore. I am not following you. I can change, too. Sheng, are you ok? Did Xianer bully you? Why did he ask that in full daylight? It's too obscene! Are you in love with her? No matter what she is, I won't be captivated. Mayor, good-bye, take care! Good, go to work as a coolie in town. It's better to rely on yourself than to rely on Xianer's relief! Don't forget to come home earlier for New Year! Wait. This is a chance to make a fortune for our Liuxian Village! We should take advantage of the fox spirit to promote tourism. I have a plan. How about change my house into an inn? What do you think, Mayor? It sounds feasible. But Xianer is different from us anyway, and she hates noisy. I fear that she will be unhappy. This is my own home ground, I have the final word. "Liuxian Inn" A bit more, hey, lower on your side, a little bit to the left side, - umm, ok, lower, - Ok... perfect. Pay me back. Oh, you come just in time. I am going to pay you back, so I am trying hard to earn money. I will pay you back as soon as I make a profit. - How do you make a profit? - It will depend on you. You will be the trademark figure of my inn, mystify and play with the guests. I suppose we will be thriving - in two months. - Nice, huh? It's not nice, it's cool! I said nice try! That's not bad. This cloth is not washed yet. You frightened me, brat. Don't beat me anymore, or I will be more stupid. Ghost! Ghost! Look, what are these disgusting things? Sinister! Terrible! What happened? Wang Sheng, you are the most learned among us. What is this? "Liuxian Inn" Welcome, please come in, thank you, thank you. "Liuxian Inn" Here comes the guest. Get up, get up. Get ready. Guest? "Peace wherever you go" Where is the guest? Just a mistake. Please go home and take a rest. And come early tomorrow. "May wealth come generously to you" "Peace wherever you go" Five miracles in Liuxian Village. First, stalactite grotto of sparkling fireflies, which makes you indulge in happiness. Second, the Great Sea. Third, parents prefer daughter to son. Fourth, to see the king on the Wangxian Terrace. You can't even see the capital city on the Wangxian Terrace, how is it possible to see the king there? Absolutely nonsense! Fifth, the sunset beyond the mountain. The setting sun is reluctant to leave because the love from the mountain. But what does it mean that a man and a fox enjoying sunset together? I see, it's a metaphor that we both hope to retain the good times. Why do I think of this? Crazy! Evoke emotions with the scene, how innovative! Whether a person, or a landscape, should have feelings, poetry. I have a lot to learn from you? I slept again, I am a real genius. It should be around here... got it. I am back again. What do you like to drink this time? Anything except well water. Then a bottle of river water. Hostess, hostess, sorry, granny, I got the wrong person. No, you didn't. She is the hostess Sister Li. No, that's impossible. She became like this overnight, after sucking your whammy gas. You are so capable! I didn't intend to, sorry. Brother Qian, I have set up a resort project. I know you have a wide network of friends, so would you please help me promote it... Promote? I'd like to get you out here. Don't bother us. You will be in trouble sooner or later. Get out... He has searched Wuxian Town, and he will soon arrive here on the way. It's terrific, brother, please help me promote our Liuxian Village in Wuxian Town. We are going to split up, who cares about promotion. Hey, you pack of rogues, does anyone know where Princess Xianxia is? He, ask him, - he knows. - You... I just heard some gossip, I have never seen the Princess! Whom did you hear from? Where did you hear? Capital First Restaurant. It spread from mouth to mouth. - And... - Who is the first? Who cares? I don't really know... the story is just like this. Take your time, I must go now. No one can leave here before you make it clear. I don't believe you can beat 9 men at a time. What, what happened? Nothing happened? What happened last night? "Liuxian Inn" Why I wasn't shot? I thought I was dispirited, and actually I was scrapped. Xianer is dying, what can I do? Are you sick? No, why? Then why did you draw my portrait? I didn't draw your portrait. How come? Hey, what's the matter? I've told you not to wander around. The General has killed a lot of your fellows, he will find here sooner or later. I just wandered in this house. If you are so scared, you'd better give up the resort project. Then how about the villagers? They can't just rely on your relief. We are not disabled, we don't want to be parasites. But don't worry; I will protect you if something happens. You protect me? You can protect me? Why not? Sheng, hurry to ancestral temple, something happened. Where is the fox spirit? - I don't know. - Say! I really don't know. If you don't say, I will kill him! No, please don't. What happened, sir? There must be something wrong. Sir, they are innocent, please free them. They are innocent, then you are guilty. Sir, creativity is very important now. Otherwise how can we attract you to come here? Yeah... How come there are so many fox spirits in the world, - right? - Shut up, give me. This is personal belongings. - No, no, no, - Get off! What are you doing? Stop, I know! - Search! - Yes, sir. - Hurry, hurry, hurry! - That way... Fox, there is a fox. The fox run out through the window. Chase. Get out.

Don't beat! Xianer, run away. Haha, mission completed. You, collect the corpse. - Go. - Yes, sir. Sheng. Our last hope, is gone. Our hope is gone. Xianer, I am so sorry. I thought I could protect you and make you happy, but I overestimated myself. It's my fault, Xianer. My heart is aching I'd never known it's so miserable without you. I can never see you again. Xianer, you are alive? Are you ok? I won't die. But my sister died for me. Your sister? I never heard that before? Why did you cry? No, I didn't. I just sweat. It's good you are alive. You did cry.

We shall follow up our victory... It's all Long Leg's fault; It all most killed Sheng I am sorry. Never mind, it was an accident. Oh, no! It's lucky that he rose to the occassion I didn't! Oh, Huo Sheng, it was you, wasn't it? Me? I was having trouble myself. Princess, was it you... I wouldn't ask you if that was me, stupid. That was not me, leader, you saw that. Well, I saw that, but not very clear. It seemed to be Mayor, or Wang Sheng, but when I watched carefully, it seemed to be myself. If I watch even more carefully, it seemed to be the fox spirit. It really freaked me out! So who was that? Could it be... Me, it was me! I have to tell the truth! Really? Of course. Wu Zhen may become aware of our whereabouts. Now there are only few of us left. You must leave as soon as possible. Go. Where are you going so late? Whom are you looking for? Nothing, I am not going anywhere. "Fox Suppressing" I got it! Xianer, I have a question to ask you. Fox spirit, come to die! Xiao Cui, don't shoot. What fox spirit? You are as foxy as a fox, too. Let's talk about it. If you insist to shoot, shoot me. You are deluded by her. You are hopeless, get away! Why not use the stairs. Some kind of affectation? Don't worry, I will protect you. Get away now. Ok, I go. We go together. It's real fun. You will regret it if you don't go. Hey, bro, what is inside? - Is it fun? - Boss Ding, how is it? Bloody good! Why is it so good? How can it be so good? It's impossible to be so good! It's thrilling. I will come to play every day. Make sense! - Get some... Come on. - I want too... Bungee jump! "Bungee jump" "Bungee jump" How do you feel? Very exciting, it's fun! "Chasing the flute evil" Ok, let's go. Good. Blow, blow, quick, blow. "Vixen's house" I only pick the most expensive ones. Ok, here we go. Wait for me. Xianer. Xianer, it's just a mistake, we were just... I have something to tell you as well. I always think you are wordy and annoying, but I can't help myself to help you again and again. I don't know why, but I can't stay here anymore. Actually, I've always had a foreboding, that you will suddenly disappear and nowhere to be found. If you go, I will go with you! Don't be emotional. Listen to me, when did your narcolepsy last occur? Oh, it haven't occurred for a long time. Do you know why? You easily fell asleep just because you want to escape from the pressure of changing your home town. And now you achieve your ambition, and feel the fullness and happiness in your life. I am so happy for you. But I am not ordinary people, I am used to leading a wandering life. I don't want you to wandering with me. We are not able to be together. I am just a passerby of your life. Do you understand? Maybe we will meet again someday. Don't be silly, please! If you leave, Xiao Cui will keep badgering me. "Liuxian Inn" Don't overcharge me! I won't. It's a lovely day. Here you are. Finish? - See you. - See you. - The business is good today. - Yes. Wow, it's sold out. We get rich... why is he here? Dongdao Changni. It's somber here; There must be fox spirit around. No. It's impossible, master. Do you make a mistake? Big brother, we have to show our abilities or they don't even know who we are. Master, please trust me, there is no fox here. Of course there is! Just in Duomi Temple. Make sense. Ok, we will go to Duomi Temple tonight. It finally comes... You saw that? They come... what's the matter, Xianer, why are you crying? I'm ok. I have made up my mind. It's time to leave. Where do you go? I don't know. Listen, Xianer, the most dangerous place is usually the safest place. Stay here, I promise, no one can hurt you. You? In fact, I am well-versed in kungfu... perhaps! What are you talking about? That's possible! I am a cursed jinx. People who stay with me will be haunted by bad luck. There was a woman turn to granny overnight after sucking my whammy gas... Do you only care about a woman's appearance? Frankly, few men can resist the seduction from a beauty, you know. 50 dollars. It's too cheap, I won't buy it. See? This amulet has the name of Grey Fairy on it. It worth 500 dollars. - So what is it used for? - It can keep you safe I am very safe now. Buy this, the Pixie Sword. Hey, hey, what are you doing here? Selling fox-expel items is prohibited in this village, trespassers will be prosecuted. Whatever you will be, my love will not change. But I really hope that you can remain beautiful forever. Open the door, I am Xiao Cui. I said you are fox spirit, and you didn't admit. Leave here. How can a fox spirit get true love? That's all I want to say. I will figure out the problem outside and get those trouble makers off. We can't lead a happy life if they don't get away from here. Ok, I leave you alone. But... Don't worry; I will take care of myself. Go to help Xiao Cui. - Xianer... - Go. Mayor! My son is missing. Sir, did you see my son? No. Oh... my boy, where are you? Help, help, my son is missing, please help me. Start! "Duomi Temple" - Witch fire? - Nothing. Go. - Accident. - Accident? It's... Go to help Xianer. Hey, I ask you to try the clothes? Where are the people? Maybe she left. Foxes are cunning; You'd better worry about yourself. Mayor, did you see Xianer? Well, no, I didn't. Mayor, Mayor, my son is missing. You, your son is missing? Did he just go to play outside? But he is not able to walk yet. Calm down, I will rally the villagers to find your son. Thank you, thank you. Please come with me. Let's go. Sir, you look so good, it must be very fruitful. Don't you know I hate back-seat driver? Did you see a young girl called Xianer? Young girl? Aren't you looking for a kid? Xianer. Xianer... Stop calling, we go off separately to look for her. Foxes are all very tricky. We don't need to worry about her. Let's go home and take a good rest. You go back to sleep by yourself; I will go on searching. Hey, Wang Sheng, have you ever loved me? - Xianer. - Have you? - No! - Why? Because... because, I don't know. - Do you like Xianer? - Yes, I do. - Why? - Because she is a bimbo. So I don't measure up to a fox spirit? You can't compare human with fox. Just like there are bad guys, there're good foxes too. Don't think too much, go home and take a good rest. Xianer? You fox spirit! Seduce innocent boys. Beat you! You fox spirit! Xianer is Princess Xian Xia I will enforce justice today, and kill the evil foxes! How can you beat a handsome man like me? Xianer. Xianer. Xianer, don't make me worry. Actually I am not fox spirit, I am Princess Xian Xia. You are princess? Then I will be the prince? You are princess, so what's going on? I prefer to make a living away from home, and have practiced Japanese magic and ninjutsu. So I know all those tricks. Wu Zhen controls the affairs of state. My marriage to Wu Zhen was just a temporary expedient. I was very angry because my Father didn't consider my feelings at all. On the wedding day, I asked my maid Chun Tao to dress up as me, and I pretended the fox spirit who abducted her. I thought it would be all over, but he wasn't deterred. Wu Zhen is ruthless and merciless. He will massacred all the inhabitants in the village. You must hurry back to evacuate the villagers. Ok, then how about you? You are princess, so he is Yuanfang, you are Brother Sharp, you are Lady Gaga and you are Psy? They are my friends. They protect me in secret, and create illusions so that Wu Zhen cannot find me I am no match for Wu Zhen. But we are be able to hamper Wu Zhen if we fight together. - So you may go back. - But... Ok. Maybe we could never meet again. Wang Sheng, take care of yourself. Everyone, get ready. It's not nice, it's cool! I said nice try! You protect me? You can protect me? My love will not change... How good if you kept lying to me! Why expose it? Xianer... Xiao Cui, why are you still here? You are just in time. Please go to the cave to protect Xianer, and I go to call the reinforcements. Xianer... Hey, listen, you are now having a chance to make a good fortune. You don't need to be monster hunters anymore. Princess Xian Xia is in trouble now. We can make a fortune if we help her out. How many villains are coming? - Oh, just one. - Just one? - Let's go. - Come on, follow me. Rats! I am late again. I won't be the last one this time. Dongdao Changni. Xianer, Xianer... - Xiao Cui. - Xianer. What happened to you, Xiao Cui? Princess, oh, my wife, it's time for us to go home and give birth to a baby. Wu Zhen, enough. I have never married you. I didn't expect you to practice unorthodox effort, and taking the boy's brains... You do me wrong, Princess! Don't try to deny. I saw that by myself! I can tolerate your insolence and rudeness. But I can't spare such mortal sin... I did this just to upgrade my martial skills, to protect His Majesty, to protect the country, and the most important, to protect you... You are hopeless. I will enforce justice on behalf of heaven today. You are so cruel! You want to kill your husband before the wedding night? Good, I will play with my wife. You ran away last time, but you won't have the luck this time I believe the good people will be well-rewarded. I am just looking for the first victim of my invulnerability. Xiao Cui. Are you ok? Go and help her. Xiao Cui. He is very powerful, look out! Dongdao Changni... - Dongdao Changni... - Come on, go! I must be the first one this time. Riches are just out there, go and get them! Come on if you want to die. What did you say? I didn't hear it. I can't believe I am the first one to die, Dongdao Changni... Oh, no! I'd better get out away. Go to that side if you want to be rich. You are all treacherous! How can you help him to beat me! And how about you? I want to be rich, but I want to kill you either, - you say? - Kill you then. My face, my face.

How many you can kill? - Let's go! - Fight! "Dingziku tour group" Thank you, thank you very much. You are really the princess of magic whip. Hey, how are you? Are you missing your princess? I don't know. There is no fox spirit in this world at all. But I feel that we were closest to each other when she pretended to be a fox. Now she returns to a princess, I am afraid we are not able to be together. - Are you Wang Sheng? - Yes? Where, where? There. Your Royal Highness. Stand up! Thank you, your Royal Highness. Wang Sheng, Princess's face was disfigured. She is no longer the beautiful Xianer you've known. Do you still love her? Your Royal Highness, even the most beautiful girl will become old and wrinkled some day. She is the one for me comes by destiny. No matter how ugly she is, I will love her and protect her unreservedly, as long as she will. Xianer, you? You can kiss me now? Hey sister, you are less impatient than me. Congratulations, Princess! Don't call me Princess, we are friends. Oh, we are friends... So, what do you want to be The head of the theme park or the government official? It's up to you.
