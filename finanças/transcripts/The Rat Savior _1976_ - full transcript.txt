Just a moment. - There were we? - 'The plumbing is..." ...is so corroded that the leaking water and damp have made the premises so musty that they are unsuitable o! work and occupation. Please, can't you see the predicament we're in? I'd like to know if you'll he publishing it. Here below... that's it. I'm sorry to return it but it's not for publication. You promised! You said it was brilliant. I don't know, maybe I did. Maybe l liked it personally but there are other hoard members. I don't think many of them liked how you described the epidemic. Where were we? "... Unsuitable for work and occupation." The floors are rotten, white-ant infested, and on the verge of collapsing. They're a haven for rats, mice and other vermin. But the novel is symbolic, sir... It's not meant to he real. I'm sorry but I can't help you. Even if the artistic elements were satis- factory the time is not right for a novel. I'm sure you understand. Goodbye.

Yes, l guess it's tlle times. l won't get you into trouble. l'll find somewhere else. Wait... I know a place. It's not too comfortable, but... Who needs comfort? Don't tell anyone about it.

Ladies and gentlemen... I'm happy to see... ...tilat our mission is becoming reality. Those who are not with us are joining us. Those who are against us are disappearing one by one. The day is not fa! off when well he all there is. And, otherwise, nobody more. What's happening with Professor Boskovic? He'll die tonight, Great Saviour. He lives at 97 Kestenova St. with his daughter. Then liqllidates him. - There is a spy.' - Up there he is.' - Up there he is.' - Do not let him escape! It was right here, sir. I was upstairs. There is no trace of anything, sir. Certainly not of a banquet. It can't he. They were here. I saw them. Come with me. Let's go. This is where they keep their food. It was all there. They might have killed Professor Boskovic. His home has been ransacked. If he exists, I'm sure he'll prove to he quite okay. It's most serious, sir. They're a threat to all of us. It's late and I've been on my feet all day. I have a long night ahead of me. Go and get some rest. Thank you. That's enough... That's enough! Stop it.' I know what you're up to. But you never succeed. He's an informer! He needs a good lesson. Kill him! - Don't let him go.' - Stop! Let him go. I'll take care of him. Come on. Let's go. The dance goes on. I'm Professor Martin Boskovic. Prof. Boskovic has been liquidated. Not yet. I knew they'd come for me so I was ready to flee. You! phone call was a signal that the time had come. - Why didn't you call the police? - You saw how much they believed you. Here we are. I'm at my friend's house. They've gone abroad. Come. Come in. This is my daughter. I think you've met. Hello, Father. Hello. Come in. What son' of work do you do, M! Gajski? I studied philosophy. I write but without much success. - Actually, I'm unemployed. - Philosophy. Have you read En' Ertnls 'The Heritage of the King Rat"? - No. - It was written 400 years ago in Germany. Ertnls was hllmed to death in Bremen. You're no great writer and I'm no great scientist. People hnlsh me off o! laugh at what I'm doing here. Maybe we can join forces. You an me, together. - Science is not my forte. - It doesn't matter. l'm offering you a post as my assistant. ll' you accept, you'll have to live here. I'm honoured, but I won't he of much Ilse. Please excuse me. Will you he my assistant? - Yes, Professor. - We'll talk late! about what's ahead of lls En' Ertnls. 'The Heritage of the King Rat." The rat, a cunning and dark creature, can control the human mind. It rules over the mysteries of the underworld where it, capable to changing its appearance. The rat, a cunning and dark creature, can control the human mind. It rules over the mysteries of the underworld where it is. They dress as humans, they grow arms llml legs. They dress as humans, have human eyes and faces and are indistinguishable from humans. The love epidemics, hunger, wars, invasions. The rats get together, mysteriously disguised and act like people. You may even talk with them without knowing who they are. They steal and make profits unfathomable to honest men. They deceive with their garb and soft-spoken manner. The kill, hum and cheat. They're fond of luxury, good food, drink and especially power. In times of crisis, the Rat Saviour arrives a huge Guinean rat. He grants them powers beyond human understanding. Sit down. Do you think it's working? Yes, if it's a rat poison you're looking for. A rat poison for human rats, not for animal rats. Do you believe that those people in the hank were not real people? What if they were rats transformed into people? I'm looking for indicator B. It's a potion for detecting people with the slightest rat like properties. And killing them. The chemicals I need are disappearing from the shops. Maybe I can find some for you. Think it over. It could he dangerous. Working with me, you'll attract the whole mall's attention. They'll he after you more than me. Why do you need so much? There are lots of rats at my place, so I... Why didn't you say so? I've noticed it too. They've multiplied so much recently. - I rent out rooms so I... - Okay, okay. I must wam you though. It's not inexpensive. - Don't worry. l'll pay you. - Very well. Come hack in two days. l'll tee it up. What's wrong, Sonia? I don 't know. 0n one of the shelves, there was a rat. He was looking right at me. I feel so sick. I've never felt like this. Come, you'll feel better. I'm feeling much better. I told you. - What happened, sir? - You! place is full of rats. - What rats? We don't have rats. - Rats.' Real rats, you idiot! There. Sonia is now out of danger. As if nothing eve! happened. The people in the tavern. What were they like? Everything seemed normal. He's now obsessed with devouring his own kind. A cannibal rat. We'll release him into the sewers tonight. Late! on, we'll release some more. - Why did you kill them? - It's olnjoh. We're from city sanitation. By the way, what does it concern you? Who are you generally? Sonia. What are you doing here? I had to come out. I was afraid of you. Sonia! Sonia! Was she really like me? Very much. How was she dressed? I don 't remember. There.' The Rat Saviour. When he disappears, they'll he what they were. I don't really understand what you're trying to say. Was it a murder o! an accident? Was Professor Boskovic bitten by an animal? A rat? - 0! did some organisation kill him? - Probably both. The criminal law treats animal victims as accidents. But if it was premeditated then it wasn't an "accident". If I remember, you took lls to a hank once to show lls the headquarters of a secret organisation. I did. But I never dreamed it was an organisation rlrn by rats. 0! that many were in its service. My dear sir, you're stretching credibility. - Anything new? - Nothing you haven't seen, sir. - Pack up. - Yes, sir. My deepest sympathy, miss. Sir. My deepest condolences. It's a difficult moment to all of us. - Who are they? - I don't know. I've never seen them. Let's go. Quickly. Please keep this confidential. I've noticed some strange things happening there. It's not an isolated case, Mr. Mayor. They've taken over key civic positions. - The Chief of police... - Leave the chief to me. l'll take care of him. Could you continue working on that indicator alone? Maybe. I learned a lot from the Professor. - But I need some... - Yes, the chemicals. I provide those. We'll keep in touch. The next time you come... please use the lea! door, not the main one. You can speak to my personal secretary. She has my full confidence. Come, I'll show he! to you. I'm sorry, I have an important meeting in 5 minutes. - I can't thank you enough. - You can thank nle when it's over, young man. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Do you realise what this means? You! father had found the indicator. They came to destroy it and they're all dead. I wonder what the Professor did. - I call the police. - No.' We'll only tell the mayo! about this. l'll get rid of the bodies. I know nothing about it. I'll tell Mr. Mayo! that you are here. - What's you! name? - Gajski. Ivan Gajski. I'm sorry. M! Mayo! is not in. He's just gone out. If you can't wait, you can write a note, stamp it and give it to me. - Perhaps he left a message. - Try again tomorrow. Who knows what's going on over there? He might have been liquidated too. - Hail the Saviour! - Hail the Saviour! Excuse me. Who is the man who went in there? - Who are you? Are you all right? - Sony. Maybe he went in here. Kindly explain, sir, what's going on? Who are you after? - He must he here. - Who are you looking for, sir? - What gives you the right, sir? - Call the police. Police? The man's not normal. Call the hospital. Help me. He's down there somewhere. - Who are you after? - A monster! A rat. For God's sake, sir. If you like rats, catch them yourself. Be sensible. They're people with the power of rats. - Il' the leader dies, they all die. - Maybe they're all in you head. - What's going on? - He's chasing rats. - - He must he mad. - Go home, folks. You come with me. - I'm not going anywhere. - Let nle go.' - Come with nle.' - What's going on? Leave the man alone. Mr. Mayor. - I know this man. Get my car. - Yes, Mr. Mayor. - It's all right, ladies and gentlemen. - It's the mayor. I don't understand that. Wondering the major knows such people. - I nearly had him. - Who, Mr. Gajski? Are you okay? The Saviour. Look. This is his. Fantastic. Why did you go it alone? You should have called me. I did. Didn't you! secretary tell you? My. dear, Mr. Gajski. She was one of them. There are so many I don't know who to trust. Don't he surprised I'm here. I've been going out alone a lot recently. I can feel something happening. I must do something, but what? Professor Boskovic knew them. He could have saved us. He'd found indicator B. Why didn't you say so before? That makes you the saviour of this town. You! ca! is ready Mr. Mayor. Take the gentlemen home. We need to talk. Come to my office tomorrow. Thank you Mr. Mayor. To the Flower Market, please. In the cellar! Great Saviour. I was told to watch the hank. I didn't say you held you! meetings there. The man had nowhere to go. I only tried to help him. That's just it. The wonl "llelp" exposes you. lt proves you are still what you were. Proceed. What's wrong, M! Gajski? Didn't you suspect that it was me? We're everyone and everywhere, despite your indicator. Don't he afraid. We're more human than any of you. 0l" ties with them only give us supernatural powers. You'll he as close to lls as was you! friend M! Rllpcic. 0r Professor Boskovids daughter at the tavern. We've all been through it. It makes us closer, it gives us power. Sooner o! later, everyone will he with us. From now, there?! he another Gajski. 0l" own. As devoted to us as you! sweetheart. Did you notice any difference between you! Sonia and ours? Ours may he... a little less considerat... but so much more a woman. You don't seem to have much to say, Mr. Gajski. We're old friends. We'll he together now. We'll have the same goals. True? Proceed. Ivan! Don't go home. They're waiting for you. I barely got away. Stop it.' - You are not Sonia. - What's wrong with you, Ivan? Ivan! Ivan! - What's wrong with you? - You do not deceive me.' Who touched this? Nobody. You know I don't understand any of it. Come. Come. I'm dying and there's no hope for any of you. Not until a new saviour appears. He'll come, but in a time of crisis. You will call for him.' He'll come, maybe soon. He 'll come. The Rat Saviour
