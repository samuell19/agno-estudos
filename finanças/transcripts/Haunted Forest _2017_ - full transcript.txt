Come on! Let's go. You know what, your Aunt Merly and I used to play here. Can you see that calabur tree? Before, we used to climb that. Sis Merly! Sis! Hey! Hey Mitch! Mitch! Mitch! Mom? They're here! Come here. - Aris! - Sis! How are you? Aris! How are you? You know, we have not seen each other for a long time! - Is she... - Nica! She's your Aunt Merly. This is Nica now? - Yes! - Oh she's all grown up! And she's so beautiful! Here's your cousin, Nica. She's your cousin, Mitch. Hi Nica! Oh my! Sis, nothing has changed with our house. Oh yes, but there are some leaks. And some parts that are broken. Also in the kitchen, we need it to be repaired. Okay, we'll have it fixed. And... - Oh my God! There are so many rats... - Excuse me. Do you have Wi-Fi here? She said, Wi-Fi. Nica, we don't have that here but, in the plaza, there are internet cafe's. I'm sorry about that. Maybe it's much better if... Uhm... Can you please take her to her room, - and fix her things. - Okay, okay. - Here's her things. - Okay no problem. - Also her bedding. - It's a little heavy. - I can do it. - No Nica, I'll do it. - I can do it. - No Nica, I'll do it. It's okay. Oh my God! We have not seen each other for so long. You have a big body! You really look like the police. Isn't it great? Sis, the trip was so tiring. I know, the trip was so long. Can I have some coffee? - Of course! - Where will I put my things? You remember the fried rice? Yes. Hey, Aris! Yes sis; I'm sorry if the house is dirty. Its because of Mitch. Oh my God, she doesn't do anything around the house. Please bear with us. Come on Aris. This is your house too. HEY, it's too early for that! It's Cynthia's end of mourning today, right? It's Cynthia's end of mourning today, right? Yes it is... That's why Nica's in a bad mood. Oh yes, I noticed that. She's irritable, huh? It even got worse when her Mama died. You go back to the crime scene. - Yes Sir. - You take care of the evidence. Okay Sir. Also, talk to the witness again. His statement isn't accurate. Procopio did that Sir. No, it can't be like that. - Sir! - He wants to be a witness... Aris? Aris! - How are you Nardo! - How are you?! I'm okay. You have a rank now, huh. So, I will call you Sir. You don't have to. In our town, rank isn't anything. We are equal here, even our salary! Sit down. You look good! Sir, I'll just fix this. - Come back as soon as you can. - Okay Sir. Your office looks good. I know right? How are you? Here, I am fine. - I almost forgot, condolence... - Thank you. If it's okay, I don't want to talk about it anymore. Here. Here are your files. Okay, but we'll look into that later. Work again? This is badly needed! Here are your files, but forgive me... you'll have an awful start, and this might be familiar to you. I have to guess, where did you find her body. Bro, it's the same as Lorena's. And that's not all, look at this. It happened continuously. Those who died before her, we ruled out suicide. But the old ones said That was not it... They we're taken by Sitsit. What? The monsters in the trees? Creatures! Come on! Do you really believe that. Let's just say that Sitsit is true. Let's just say that Sitsit is true. Do you have a witness? Bro, we have a witness and he's pointing to Voltron! See! Are you kidding me? Voltron is a cartoon character! No! Do you remember Juanito? The crazy guy. The one who's roaming around here, filthy. Oh yes. - You remember him? - Yes, yes. So what? Now, they call him Voltron. He was the last person seen, when the incident happened. What now? What now? Let's drink now. It's still early. You're like a fool. You're the one who asked for this. Cheers! Is there anyone here? It's okay bro! There's nothing wrong with this. Hey bro! I'll go ahead. Lorena? Uncle, Let's eat! - Oh yes, thank you! - Come on! Let's eat. -Oh my, sister! It looks like delicious. Oh yes, of course. I'm your sister. You know, I'm really good at cooking.

Well, you're just lucky... Someone is coming. Chicken! Chicken! - Voltron! - Chicken! Chicken! Just be calm. Don't run away. We will just talk. Okay? Come here. Hey! Stop! No Sir. Enough. That's enough. You bastard! You wore me out! Are you stupid! That's enough. Huh?! Let's go, let's go! I'm not really into social media, that's why it's okay with me if there's no connection at home. What's that? Hey! Please add me there. I'll just add mine. Oh! Is this your mom? Yes. She is beautiful, right? Very beautiful. My mom also told me that my uncle's wife is really beautiful. She's right. Uncle is really lucky. But my mom was unlucky. Why do you say that? Oh! RJ. Hey Mitch! Why weren't you there yesterday? Where have you been? Because my uncle and my cousin arrived yesterday. Anyway, this is Nica. Nica, he's RJ. I'm RJ. Hey Mitch! We're still going, huh? You'll do the cooking. Okay, yes! Do I still have a choice? There's none, right? Hmm... It's okay for Andrei and I to cook. Just don't blame us for whatever the taste is, okay? Well, it's okay if I'm the one who will cook. Okay, I have to go. - It's okay. - Just send Andrei a message. Yeah sure. Okay. (man muttering...) Mitch? Who's that? Ah... That's Uncle Feleo. There's a lot of weird things here.

Busy, huh. - That's true! - I don't think so. Is that what a stalker is? We've been to far place! I said I'm not a stalker. Yes it is! What do you... I just asked you to fetch some garlic and you came back closer? You two! Come! Have you strolled around our place? Uhm, I went to the plaza. You might want to join us, we'll go by the river after the rain. - Join us. - He's right. Join us. They're right, join us Nica. Anyway you've already helped us out so come and join us. Thank you. If you're not coming with us, Mom will just ask you to join her watching her telenovelas. Telenovelas? - You'll join us? - Yes. Great! But is it okay?

Over here. Do you like... Are they together? Andrei? With other girls he's confident, but when it comes to Mitch he can't say anything. Do you have a boyfriend in Manila? None at all. No one took a risk. I don't believe you. I'm telling the truth! In Manila? Yes, as in anywhere. None at all. Nica . I don't drink. I already cursed that liquor. Really? RJ, then take it. But why?

Nica! Next time, you should ask permission first. I'm just thinking about you. H's dangerous in our place. You're thinking about me'? This time, you're really thinking about me? At the time when Mama is dying. Did you feel worried about me? I did not see even your shadow! I was fixing a case that time. A case? Or were you drinking again? Your wife is going to die, but you still opt to drink! Nica. You got scared! You relied on alcohol? I needed you at that time, Pa. I needed you at that time. Nica... Nica... - Let me go. Let go of me! - Please stop it. Nica? Nica! Sis! We just went to the river this afternoon. I don't know what happened. What's going on with your cousin? Hey! She has fever. She's hot! Nica! I'd like to talk to you. Sis, wait. Pa, please don't leave me. Stay here. Someone wants to take me. Please don't leave me Pa! - Please don't leave me! - No, I'm not don't worry. Pa, stay here please.

You know what, your mom and I used to go here when we were young. Yes, she told me about that. She even caught more fish than you. Really? But it's true. Your mom was good at fishing. I just want you to know that, there isn't a single day, that I'm not thinking about your mom. I love her so much. Oh, you caught one! Wait! - Get the knife! - Where? It's on my jacket. Help me out with this one. Go ahead but, be careful. That's sharp. In the neck. Pa! Who's going to clean the fish? And why do we need to get it home alive? It's delicious when it's fresh. And you asked who's going to clean it... It's you. Huh? Let's go. Uhm, Pa. Uh... Can I go with Mitch later? Where are you going? Uhm... The next barrio is having their fiesta. We just want to watch their street dance. We're going someone else and we have a ride. Promise, we won't come home late. Alright. Just be sure you text me. And before you go, these should be cooked already. Pa. Thank you. Let's go. Let's start with these. If If IX If IS' If If If Finally, we're here! Mitch... We've known each other for a long time. I'm just wondering, of all your suitors you didn't like any of them. Yeah, you're right. Maybe because, the right person has not arrived yet. The right person has not arrived yet. What do you look for a man? What I like? You know, the one that I've known for a long time. When I'm with him, He makes me laugh... He makes me smile... Then, gives me an unexplainable feeling. You don't know what it is. You're cute. You don't know, you've always been with that person. Maybe, he's too shy to tell you that. The Fiesta here is really enjoyable. Do you do these regularly? Yeah, it's enjoyable, right? We do this every year. Yet for me, this is the most enjoyable. Why? Because... I'm with you. Oh, he's good. You both dance alike. No, I do not dance. Mitch, Wait for me. Where are you going? I'm going to pee. Oh no, we don't know anyone here. Nica, What's keeping you? Uhm... I can't pee. I'm not used to peeing outside. Okay, I will go a little bit farther. Maybe your pee's a little bit shy with me. - Okay. - I'll be there. Okay, okay. Hey! Let's go? Are you okay'? Nica! Nica! Nica! Give it to me. What happened? Nica. Uncle, we were just at the festival awhile ago and then, she suddenly passed out. We didn't know what happened. Sir, we will go ahead. I think Nica should rest. We will visit her again. We'll go ahead Mitch. Okay, take care. (praying...) Domine patri! , , Spiritus sancti. Domine patri! Fili spiritus sancti. Fili. Spiritus sancti. Domine patri! Fili spiritus sancti. Kristus! Kristus! Fili spiritus. Domine... What are you doing here? What is this? What is this? Saw. I don't care if you are a devil! Or a witch! Don't you ever come back here. Go away! Go away! Aris. Aris. I didn't know you were already here. Nica's awake, she's looking for you. It's delicious! Nica? Good morning Sir. - Good morning. - Pa. How are you? I. I'll take care of that. You've been here for awhile? I just came by. I'll go ahead now. - Okay. - Get well soon, Nica. Thank you for the flowers. - I'll go ahead. - Okay then. I almost forgot, The doctor came and he told us that she can be discharged tomorrow. - Really? - Yes. - What do you want to eat? - We'll go home tomorrow. - Slowly. - Careful. Slowly. Careful. Nica, my child, if you need anything I'm just here. Call me anytime. I just need to go to the bathroom. Wait a minute. Uncle, have you eaten? I cooked some porridge. I'm fine, thank you. Okay- How about you Nica? Do you want some water? OKAY - Nica. Are you okay? I'll just need to go somewhere. I need to take care of something. If you need something, just text me. Your Aunt Merly will take care of you. I'll come back as soon as I can. Bino! Anybody here? What do you want? I am Inspector Guzman. Can we talk? How is my daughter's case? Are you doing something about it? You should be investigating right now. And now, why are you bothering me? Go away. It's already late. You're disturbing me. Hold it! Don't come near me. Don't meddle with me! Go away! - Wait, let's talk. - Go away! We don't have much time. There's no more time! I need to bring that woman to the tree of the Sitsit. If not, I will not see Kristine anymore. I won't see my child anymore. Go away. Please go away! Wait, let's talk. I won't see my child anymore! Don't meddle with this. Go away! Go away! Forget your plan. There's no more time. There's no more time. I won't see Kristine anymore! There's no more time. There's no more time! Kristine. You scared me. Nica? Nica, I am talking to you. Nica. (Nica screams!) Nica, what's happening to you? Nica, what's happening to you? Are you two fighting? You two, stop it! Will you please stop your fighting, you two! Stop it! Shut up! Woman, you don't know anything about this! Nica! What happened to you? Don't talk to my mother like that! You're a flirt! You're a scandalous woman! You're a flirtatious woman! You are useless! (Nica screams!...) (Nica screams!...) Nica! Oh my God! What are we going to do? Nica... Nica! What are we going to do Morn? Water! Nica! Aris, what's happening to your daughter is not ordinary anymore. Aris, what's happening to your daughter is not ordinary anymore. I think the better thing to do is, to ask help from Apo... A healer from the suburb. I know you don't believe in those thing, but can you think of anything else? Be mindful that the doctors didn't find anything wrong with her. You're cured. Thank you Apo. Thank you. Thank you. Abner! Come here. Can you buy some gin from Metring? Give me the money. Good morning. Good morning. Are you... Yes I am. It's because we have a problem. We just need your... regarding your niece? Good day. How's Nica? She's resting. Mitch texted me. That's why we wanted to check on her. Uncle. Where is Nica? She's not in the living room! Huh? Nica? It's closed. Uncle! Nica! Nica! Nica, put that down! Put it down. Nica! Nica! Nica! Nica! Let her rest. Nica... I need candles. I need a basin of water and used clothes of your niece. I think this is going to be hard. My child, please wait for me outside. I think it's going to be hard to remove whatever entity is in your daughter. It's easier if it's a witch or an elemental. What's really happening to Nica? She's being seduced by Sitsit. Little by little, they are toying with her... the entity who's living in there and taking over the mind of the girl... until it deteriorates, and weakens her. (Praying in Latin) (Whispers...) Uncle! Uncle! Why? What's happening to you? Sis, what's happening here? (Exorcism chant...) (Exorcism chant...) Hold her, just hold her! Oh my God! (Nica screams!) It's your turn, go. - Teach me how, I don't know how to do that. - Okay, that's easy. You begin with... It's hard! - Teach me how. - No, just press it when you're closer. - Okay. Hi Uncle. Bro, we need to be more vigilant now. You know, there might be another victim. You know, there might be another victim. How's your daughter? She's better now. If it's possible, I'll go home early. I want to watch over her. Okay, Bro. Anyway Reyes is coming. Just coordinate with him. Just coordinate with him. Where is Andrei? I don't know about Andrei. I don't know about Andrei. He's with his mother. But he told me, he'll try to catch up. Okay. Mitch, we can't stay that long. Remember, I told Papa we'll just stay at home. Of course, we will just watch games here in the plaza. Don't worry. I want to join. You want to join? I'll just buy some drinks. Okay- - Okay. - Okay. It's good that you're better now. Thank you. For your concern. You visited me. That's nothing. What's important is, you're fine. There's still a last try. I feel this is the right one. But I bet in this one. But I bet in this one. The other one is more of a fighter. Wow, I didn't know girls can also join here. Psst! Psst... Psst! Psst! Psst... Psst! Psst! Psst! Nica. Nica. Where's Nica? I don't know, she's was just here. Pssst! What happened to you? - I feel pain in my... - Apo Lakay? I. Just ignore him. - Apo Lakay! - Please wait. Hurry!- Apo Lakay. What happened to you? There's something wrong. There's something wrong. What's wrong? It came back for me, all those Sitsit. All that I've done to them. Look. That's why, - I can no longer help you, Aris. - Sir! - Apo Lakay. I'm sorry. -Hey, please wait. -Sir. - What? - It's your niece. She's looking for you. What's the matter? Nica is missing. I just left her at home. We just went for a walk, Uncle. She suddenly disappeared. I told you not to go outside. Over there. Let's go, let's find her. Nica! Nica! Let go of my child! What do you need from my child? You. Let go of my child! Let's play a game. Find me a girl in exchange for your child. Bring her to me, before sunrise and I will let your child go. Okay, I will do it. Come with me. Aris? Please have pity! Please have pity, let me go! Don't hurt me, please have pity! Please don't! Please have pity on me! Please let me go! I did not do anything to you! Let me go, please have pity on me. Okay, go! Go! Where's the girl in exchange of your child? Please have mercy, let my child go. All you humans are the same. You are all, weak. This was your choice, so watch how I will shatter you and your daughter. Let go of my child. Please have mercy. I forgot to tell you, I give no mercy. Aris! Aris! Nica! Come. Nica. Nica. Aris, we're near. Aris, wait. -Aris-.. -Aris. I'm going to ask for help. Pa. Ma. My child. Thank you for giving me a chance... to redeem myself to you. Pa. Don't worry. I'm going to say hello to your Mom for you. I will tell her... how kind you are and how brave you are. Pa. I love you so much, my child. Pa--- Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Don't let yourself be drawn... She can't harm you outside the woods. The Sitsit is weak outside of its territory. There's a way to end this. There's a way to end this. No one knows what or where the Sitsit came from, but it's been pestering us for a long time. One thing is for sure... One thing is for sure... it is a creature that lives in darkness. According to older people, They are shape shifters and are free to move from different towns without our knowledge. Usually, the victim is a woman, because women are capable of giving birth. - My child! What did you do to my child! My child! - Through his victims, he gains his power of immortality. One time, he battled someone and was wounded terribly. That's why he chose to stay in the woods... Where his powers are strongest. What does he need from me? He wants to capture you. It is common for the Sitsit, to abduct girls, for them to shred. And then, he captivates their soul and they become his follower. That's what happened to my daughter, Lorena. How can we defeat the Sitsit? It's not easy. The Sitsit and the tree is living and are connected. Burn the tree. The Sitsit will be defeated. According to legend... Only one girl can do it. I will fight him. If you have decided, I will guide you. Here. Have this amulet. And... You will be invincible from the power of Sitsit. Don't be afraid. I will guide you. Help me to avenge Lorena. Nica. Where are you going? Mitch, just stay here. I know you will not let anyone stop you. I will join you. No. Nica! No. What if something happens to me? What if the next victim is me? What if there's another one? I can do it, please. Let me. Nica, don't. Nica! - No! - Nica, I will help you! - No! - What if you disappear! - Stop it! No! - What if you are next! - Get off! Nica please listen. Nica. Let us help you. No, it's dangerous. Just stay here please. - I need to go! Just stay here! -Nica, you might get in trouble! He's right, Nica. We will join you. We will join you in your fight. Give that to me. Uncle Feleo. Nica. It's good that you brought some trustworthy friends. Where is your amulet? Wear it. Here. Each of you share this. Stick it to your body. We should do this now. Let's go, there's no time left. Let's go. That's where the Sitsit lives. Here it is. Everyone get ready. Gas. He's here. Let's take out everything we need. - Mitch! -Nica! Nica! Hey! Come out here! Don't implicate my cousin. I have a lot of visitors. Show yourself. Welcome. Move! Move! - Run! - Nica! Andrei! - Come here Nica. Stand up, quick! -Andrei! Hurry! Hurry UP! Nica! -Nica. Mitch. Proceed with our plan. -Andrei! Hey, Monster! I'm here! Mitch, the lighter. Nica, I can't find the lighter! Look for it! I saw you put it there right?! Nica, hurry up! Rd! Light it up! Nica! Nica! Nica! Mitch! Help! Nica! Nica! I will let you experience what I did to your father. You cannot do that. Burn it! Burn it! This will be your end. Mang Feleo. Nica. Ouch! Ouch! Nica. Mitch! Are you alright? The air is good. Yes it's true. Hi Mitch! Andrei! I will just go there.
