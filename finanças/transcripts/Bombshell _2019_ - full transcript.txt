Welcome to the The Kelly File, I'm Megyn Kelly. Breaking tonight, polls are moving, the race is changing. And more than a dozen Republican candidates are trying to make themselves heard with a little more than one week left to the debate that could change everything. And we are the gateway. We the questioners are the gateways, we at FOX and CNN and everybody else who gets a chance to actually moderate a Presidential Debate with these guys. I mean, these guys, they deserve to face tough questioning. As Chris says and I agree, they want George Washington's job, and they better earn it. They better show the American people they are worthy of it. A lot of folks assume Donald Trump would flame out by now. They have been proven wrong. Now, wait, here. We've got to get to this. Because this is just breaking on "The Daily Beast." The headline is ex-wife, Donald Trump made me feel violated during sex. Ivana Trump once accused the real estate tycoon of, quote, "rape." Somebody who speaks for Donald Trump has come out and denied it as well. And added that legally he says, you cannot rape your spouse. Here's the one thing you probably know about me: I have a big mouth. Roger, you have Megyn on line one. - Megyn. - Morning, Roger. What'd you do to piss off Trump? We did a segment on a recent coverage of his ex-wife's rape claim. You're giving that oxygen before the first goddamn debate? Roger, we had a full screen of Ivana's recantation, which is soft. She accused him during a divorce. His lawyer, Michael Cohen, claims you can't rape a spouse, pissed me off. Great, the future of Fox News is now a goddamn feminist. No, I'm not a feminist, I'm a lawyer. We need him. Clean this up. Now! Unfortunately, when it comes to politicians and the media, Roger Ailes knows his shit. Appointed head of the Fox News Channel by media mogul Rupert Murdoch. Roger transformed cable news, barging Fox to the forefront. Years before, to get Nixon elected, he created the modern Town Home Debate. To get Reagan elected, he made him address the elephant in the room. I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit my opponent's youth and inexperience. To get George H. W. Bush elected, somebody did a Willie Horton ads. Roger denies it was him, a lot. I have been astounded at the number of Americans who are fine with our country moving in a socialist direction. Here we go. News is like a ship. You take your hands off the wheel and it pulls hard to the left. Look at this. James Murdoch, tell me those lips haven't sucked cock. This is what nepotism gets him. Roger, rules Fox from behind these doors on the second floor. When employees say "the second floor", they mean Roger, or the many VPs pay to enact his will without qualms or questions. Now I know what some of you are thinking, and no, Roger does not tell us what to say on air. He doesn't have to. - Love that dress, Megyn. - Thank you. No, really, I love it. He is not horny. He's just ambitious. Roger is always watching. The Eagles postpone their appearance because co-founder Glenn Frey is too ill to travel... Morons. The phone in his office connects directly to the control room which is down on the first floor. Yes, sir? You fucking idiots! That's not Glenn Frey, that's Don Henley. Dump the B-roll. Back to anchor. That's not Glenn Frey, that's Don fucking Henley. What the fuck Kayla?! I'm sorry, I don't know secular music. The Eagles? Only the biggest band of the 70s. When my Mom was a toddler. They all look the same, they're just old. Down in the basement is the Fox newsroom. All our shows have crews who work in these pods. This is my staff. Hey, guys. From below the city, so it smells like mold. But there hasn't been a rat citing in four months. The anchors and their key producers have base camps. Here, on 17th and 18th. Often decorated with viewer art. And everyone in this building, even Roger, answers to 8th. The 8th floor is home to CEO Rupert Murdoch and his sons. This is the power behind the power. The actual studios are scattered around the building. Most anchor and show offices are here, above our Fox Business, Radio, New York Post and The Wall Street Journal. Most of the American conservative establishment in one building. The stage is finally set for tonight's Republican debate in Cleveland. All the candidates are looking for a boost tonight, but only 10 of them have a chance to appeal to voters in the prime time. Trump has a real problem with women. I wanna ask about it. Did you back that up? Yes. Good morning. Morning, Chris. Excuse me. Do you think that's it? Sorry. It's probably nerves. No. When it's nerves I hear my heart. I can't hear it. That's your first question? Is this some feminist thing? She's not a feminist. It goes to his electability. Did you run it pass Tom Lowell? He didn't go after Trump. The second floor said that? No. The 8th. The Murdochs. Rupert called Roger and said about Trump: "Enough is enough." Look, all Trump does is watch Fox. Roger gave him air for his crazy theories and idiot grievances. Why? 'Cause Roger shares a lot of them. Are you sure you wanna take that on? Yes. I don't know if these are strong enough, but they help with nausea. You go live in five hours. I'll be fine. Okay. If you can try to keep it down. Fuck, stop making that face, Julia. I'm not making a face. Five hours? - Yeah. - Okay. Don't worry. We're behind you. Way behind you. There's a blanket on the chair, and just in case, a trash can beside. Mr. Trump, one of the things people love about you is you speak your mind and you don't use a politician's filter. However, that is not without its downsides, in particular, when it comes to women. You've called women you don't like: "fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals." What is she doing? Your Twitter account... Only Rosie O'Donnell. Great TV. Show is what she's doing. Your Twitter account... For the record, it was well beyond Rosie O'Donnell. Yes, I'm sure it was. Your Twitter account has several disparaging comments about women's looks. You once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees. Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as President... She's calling him out. ...who was likely to be the Democratic nominee, that you are a part of the war on women? Call me stupid, but I thought he'd respect the challenge. Trump is pissed. He was up all night tweeting. Crap, really? What was he tweeting? "Fox viewers give low marks to bimbo Megyn Kelly." I hate that word. It says you're too sexy to be smart, but not smart enough to be sexy. "Wow, Megan Kelly really bombed tonight. People going wild on Twitter. Funny to watch." Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Okay. How many times did he tweet? Like 15. - Fift... - Yeah. He's never gonna be President. Wait. Am I gonna be the story? No. I'm gonna be the story? No. Gretchen's giving this 2 blocks? It's that far down the food chain? We should get you a security team. Think it over. A Trump called me before the debate. He said he knew that your first question was harsh. - How could he know that? - No idea. I sure didn't. It was good TV. Unexpected. Goddamn tough. Proud of you Megyn. Thanks, Roger. Heard you were sick. Yeah. I think it was in my coffee. - Where did you get it? - My driver. He insisted on some fancy coffee joint. You know this guy? No, he's a driver, Roger. - Did you know him? - No. You know better than that! Okay, yes. Roger Ailes is paranoid. But his parents were nuts. As he drove off to college they filed for divorce. And didn't tell him. At Christmas, he came home to find strangers in his house, and all his things, photos, and yearbooks, and trophies thrown out. Is it any wonder the man created a nostalgia machine for lost America? This is crazy. We're sitting here wondering if a candidate for President poisoned my coffee. It's only crazy until it happens, and it happens. I hate being the story. I'll call Trump, you go on vacation, stay above it all. He won't dent your ratings. Nobody stops watching because of the conflict. They stop watching when there isn't one. Some viewers will listen to him. Well, some, but as long as he keeps saying Megyn Kelly is unwatchable, that means he's watching it, they know that. And they'll watch what he watches. You'll be okay. See you in a week. Drink up buddy boy. Thank you. Here's to a week of no kids but my own. Cheers. Okay. Frank Bruni, The Times: "The debate was riveting, it was admirable," it compels me to write a cluster of words "I never imagined writing, hooray for Fox News." That's gonna make you happy. Appraisal, tangled up, and then insult. It doesn't make me happy, Gil. You could see that was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her... wherever... Oh my God! Did he just accused me of anger menstruating? Yes. I'm calling Roger. No, I'll talk to him. Take a vacation, I'll handle this. Doug. Would you like to correct yourself on that other talking point, about men being dominant? We don't have any time. We're running over. HR's on the phone 'cause you called me a skirt. I gotta read that manual again. I'll bring it to your office right after the show. Some guy came up to me and said: "I saw you on 'Fox & Friends' this morning. Is Gretchen as cute in person as she is on TV?" And what did you answer him, Eric? Beautiful dress. You look wonderful. Great color. In summary, Gretchen's beautiful. Beautiful. You look beautiful. Thank you. Well, you look fabulous too! She got a wax? Doesn't waxing hurt? He looks at me for that. Women are everywhere, we're letting them play golf and tennis now. It's out of control. You read the headlines, since men are so great. She needed a shower. We had to turn off camera, it was even worse. Steve simply started ignoring me. What did Mr. Ailes say when you complained? He said: "You act like it only rains on women." "Stop getting goddamn offended by everything." "You're a men hater." And... "Learn to get along with the boys." And he took me off the show. But gave you your own. Afternoon dead zone. It was a demotion, and we both knew it. Even though I did increase the ratings by 15%. He moved me to second base. Back in Minnesota, before I graduated summa cum laude from Stanford, Before, I was crowned Miss America. I played second base in the 6th grade softball league. I hate second base. Did he ever offer to reverse that decision if you made yourself sexually available? Not directly. With Roger, it's always about loyalty. He says he can fix things if you're loyal, and you can guess the ultimate expression of loyalty. We don't guess. Oral sex. Roger likes to joke: "to get ahead you gotta give a little head." Really. But Mr. Ailes never unambiguously asks for oral sex? It was always just a joke, a put down, like: "you're sexy, but you're too much work." I have a whole list in here. Because that's just how Roger is. What do you want out of a lawsuit? What do I want? I want this behavior to stop. Someone has to speak up. Someone has to get mad. That may not be you. Your contract will have a clause requiring secret mandatory arbitration. You familiar with Rudi Bakhtiar's case? Yes. You're supposed to be. My first act as D.C. Bureau Chief. I want you down here full time. Oh my God! That's amazing. Yes! You do know what this means for you? Shit, he doesn't think I'm ready. Brian, I will not let you down. I'm gonna bust my ass for you. Rudi, come one, that's a given. So what's the problem? But... Look... You do get how I feel about you, right? Oh fuck! Fuck! I'm glad you said that, Brian. Because I really respect you too. No. No. I mean... How I really feel. Just look confused. All I want from you, Rudi, is to see the inside of your hotel room. Goddammit! That's all it's gonna take. Don't react. Make it your fault. Brian, if I've done anything to make you think I feel that way about you, I apologize. Friends. We're friends. Professionals. We have a great professional vibe. Now sell it. I just don't do that, I've never had to do that for a job. I know. I know... You know I'd kill for D.C. But there is no way I'm showing you my hotel room. This is gonna ruin my career. Now I feel like a creep. No. You're so not. Fucking creep. They fired me. I'm a lousy reporter, apparently. Assholes. She proved what they wanted her to prove. No one really wins by suing Fox News. It's been our experience that once you go public in your job. No one will hire you. If you're able to stick it out at Fox, gather more evidence, you might be able to sue Ailes himself, instead of Fox. And that is why I'm here, because Martin Hayman told me that over here, in New Jersey, I can avoid arbitration by suing Roger, personally. He says that you've managed to change the law, and that we could call other women and show a pattern. Will other women come forward? Yes. They will. You live and work in New York. Roger has a house in Bergen County, where he stays when he can't make it upstate. You did your homework, Ms. Carlson. No fingerprints. That's how much I practiced the violin as a child. If Roger finds out you came to us, he won't just fire you. He will bang us with a million dollar lawsuit, he will attack you personally. These men care more about their reputations than they do money. Roger won't stop. - Oh, I know. - You know that? Colleagues you admire will say publicly you're superior ambitious woman who's suing because her career staled. Let them. Okay. If we work hard, you might be lucky enough to watch the most powerful man in TV go after you with everything he's got. Thank you. I'm telling you, other women will come forward. Let's hope. Frankly, I think you have a gap in the network, Mr. Shine. There are millions of young conservatives in this country. You can look at my Instagram account, there are. They don't have a voice on your network. I see myself as an influencer in the Jesus space. Don't get me wrong, I've learned a ton from Gretchen, I truly have, of course, but... No judgment here, my perspective as an evangelical millennial, it's just not that helpful to her. To be honest, Mr. Shine. She's sort of establishment with a capital "e". That's why I wanted to talk to you in private. Kayla, before we move you up. I wanna ask you something personal. What do you think of our slogan? Fair and balanced. I'm glad you asked. Our new shows and our opinion shows are very different. Our news is impartial. It's top of the line. Our opinion shows... Roger gave a voice to people who didn't have one, and he balanced the American conversation. So, our news people are fair. Our entertainers are very necessary form of balance. Attagirl. Perfect. But today, we're sticking up for girls on International Day of the Girl. And for the first time on cable news, here I am makeup free - for a reason. Tomorrow I'll be back in my regular makeup. And I thank the other brave women who came on today, show, sounds makeup. Let's continue to tell our girls - just be yourself. Check. Great show. Get me some makeup. I have some bad news, Kayla is leaving us for the asshole. O'Reilly? It is our highest rated program. And we can't be? No. I believe in real story. Did you just see that segment? Did you see it? Did you see... We're doing something unique here. Together. All of us. - Can you just... - Sure. Listen to me. I can get you where you wanna be. I can protect you, just don't get ahead of yourself. You have a lot to learn, I can teach you. I'm not getting ahead of myself, Gretchen. I'm taking the next step. I learn by doing. Come on. Come on. Please. I'm confused. You want me to pass on a promotion so you can help me get the same promotion on a show with worse ratings. I want a little loyalty. I need loyalty. Women together. I'm loyal to the network. It's not us versus them, Gretchen. Miss America! Roger. Hi there. This is the treat. What the fuck are you doing? A segment on how we oversexualize women. You said be more of myself. You know what makeup does? Keeps everybody from seeing you sweat. Most of the mean tweets that I received are about my appearance. So, it is important that we fight back against this kind of bullying. Bullying isn't meanness. Bullying is people with more power hitting people with less. These jack-asses have cell phones. You have fucking TV-show! We have to fight the objectification. Bullshit! Mouth shot. Ears open. Nobody wants to watch a middle-aged woman sweat away through menopause. Not on a National fucking Television! Thank you for the advice. Objectification... All right. Gretchen, I really appreciate... Shut up! Good luck. Good one, honey. Hey. It's a zoo here. Phones ringing off the hook. Anyone care he called me bimbo? Not really. He tweeted the GQ photo. - And? - Torn. God, I'd love to be slut-shamed. Gil wants to ask again if we should make a statement. No. No response. Zero. Doug just lost. I gotta go. Next time, honey. Good game. Trump. Sixteen. Excuse me. If you talk to my wife again, I'll beat you to a fucking pulp. That was weird. You're getting some action. Oh really? Oh, man! Asshole. You don't have to worry about Trump. You're tougher than all of those guys. You just gotta worry about the crazies. I can handle a few crazies. Trump will stop once he feels he's won the argument. I feel like he's less interested in winning the argument than just having the argument with you in public to prove he can take on the establishment. I'm not the establishment. Honey, get real. You are the establishment now. - Mommy! - Not yet. You do understand I have to be above this, right? I have to be an anchor first, then a woman. The entire country is talking about your period right now. - Mommy! - What? There's a man. What? - Yardley! - Look, he's right there! Yardley, where is he? Jesus, he's got a fucking camera! Come here, honey. No. No. Don't open the door. They can't sell 'em if we're inside. Get out! Get outta here! Go! What were you guys doing? Mommy and Daddy? It was a crossword... Mommy was just taking a quick little nap. - Quick one. - It wasn't that quick. I'm gonna have to call Roger about security. As clear as a bell that Megyn Kelly has gone over to the dark side. The more she sells out the wider her nostrils have become. Listen to what I just said, have you seen them flair? This woman was once pretty. And the more she has sold out the wider her nostrils have become. They're almost porcine. She snorts her insults at America... Roger. Give me a day to figure out how we hit Trump back. Stop by later. I don't want my kids hearing this crap. Ignore the damn morons. I'm old, fat, and ugly. Christ, the call me Jabba the Hutt. Hemophilia swells my joints, can't exercise. I feel fine but I look like shit. And look the opposite of how I feel. Do I let it affect me? No. I do not. This isn't entirely true. Roger's also fat because he only get a room service menu on order page two. No goddamn orange on Fox! But he cares a lot about looks. Let's turn our attention to South Korea. South Korean official say talks with the North have... Early on he realized for a network to stay on 24 hours a day you need something to hold an audience. That something is legs. There's a reason for clear desks. We need you in a shorter dress. Wide shot! Wider! Go to the wide shot! I want to see her goddamn legs! Why the fuck do you think I hired her? Stand up and give me a spin. Really? Yeah. It's a visual medium. Yeah. That's good. Sit down. I support the law, I do, but mass deportations, come on. That will never work, because of the 14th Amendment, you want me to quote it? If you are born in America - you're an American. Period. Get me a demographically-friendly Hispanic woman on immigration. She needs to be very demographically-friendly. Okay. New girls up. Kayla? Hi, sir. I was listening to Rush Limbaugh this morning, he said something kinda cool about Anthony Weiner, how he's an exhibitionist in every aspect of how he presents himself politically. Is she the best you can do? Bill Shine asked us to give her a try. Okay, let's not lose focus, back to immigration. Oh my God! I can't get fired. This is the only job I have ever wanted. I don't wanna be on TV, I wanna be on Fox. My family... Every day... Every holiday... Especially holidays, they watch Fox News. We're like addicts. Fox is how we do church. You know when they make the corner logo turn? 'Cause folks have box burned into their TV screens. That's us. Kayla, you're not getting fired. He cannot scale his anger, he's a perpetual outrage machine. That's why crazies love him. No offense to your family. You wanna do the folders? No crying at Fox. No crying. Let me explain your mistake here. Rush is on Hannity's team. They are the competition, their GOP party hacks. He thinks he's way ahead of him. Ceil full of drudge and break bar. Do not talk radio. Okay. Also stop worrying if the story's legit. And if you can't source it, just go at "some are saying." Seriously? You have to adopt the mentality of an Irish street cop. The world is a bad place. People are lazy morons. Minorities are criminals. Sex is sick but interesting. Ask yourself what would scare my grandmother, or piss off my grandfather - and that's a Fox story. Are you writing this down? Makes so much sense. Frighten to the lay. When you're starting a story you need to start with a clear villain. Liberal judge, pinhead mayor, Vermont, Hollywood. Conservatives wanna conserve. You're the last defense against Jesus-hating, trans-loving, Clinton-controlled Armageddon, baby. Come on. You do believe some of that, right? Yeah. It's quite a face you have. Really? Thank you. - I'm drunk. - I'm drunk as well. You have a Hillary poster in your house? I guess I do. Okay. My parents would be horrified if I went home with a Democrat. The lesbianism, however? I'm not a lesbian. I'm not a Democrat. I just have two giant Hillary posters in my kitchen. As a joke though, right? No, that's who I'd like to be the President. Are you serious? I'm a closeted Democrat. At Fox News? I thought that you knew that. No. I didn't know that. Does anyone know that? Can you not tell? You can't tell anyone. - Of course, I won't tell. - I'm so serious. Can I ask something? Why do you work at Fox? When you can work at MSNBC or something. I think, I like, thrive in toxic environments. I never know if you're kidding or not. I am kidding. I applied everywhere and... I got a job at Fox. And I keep applying the other places, and they keep not taking me because I work at Fox. Oh my Gosh. It's okay. One day I'm gonna be free. What? It's not that bad. If you're gay, it's pretty bad. Yeah, you don't be gay at Fox. You work for Bill O'Reilly, you have a Hillary poster? You do know he likes to call up female producers and wack off, right? Bill? Yes, Bill. No. You haven't heard about Andrea Mackris lawsuit? - No. - Oh my God. This should be in a welcome packing. She was one of the Associate Producers. He took her, and only her, to the Republican National Convention. Called her up at 11 p.m. Touching himself, and telling her what he wanted to do to her with the old falafel. Are you kidding? It's on the internet, and then... quote, "using a vibrator upon himself." Like he brought a vibrator from home to the convention? Yes, well, you have to bring a vibrator from home to the convention. The question is, what does a man do with a vibrator? Do you place it alongside the shaft? I don't wanna hear that. "Fucking die, bitch." "If I see you, you better run." "I wouldn't be sleeping too soundly if I were you." Trump's lit the torches. You're getting security tonight. All I want is for this to go away, Roger. Look, every general in history has gone into battle feeling the same. Fine. I'll read a statement, at the top saying: "Yes, Trump is attacking me." But I'm not going to respond, any defense will come from you. Not right now. You set a record on viewer email. Let me guess. None of it on my side. No. Our audience loves Trump. And the hell of a lot more than the Murdochs realize. More than Trump knows. He's tweeting "we made peace." He'll come on 'Fox & Friends' tomorrow. He needs us. We need him. It's got nothing to do with you. All right. It's late. I have dogs to feed. Just to be clear. I will not be kissing Trump's ass at nine o'clock. We fight tomorrow's fights tomorrow. Let me see that statement again, Bill. You may have heard there was a dust up involving yours truly and presidential contender Donald... How are you doing, Megyn? Hanging in there. Give him hell, Megyn. We go live in five... four... three... two... I just got back from a weekend at the beach with my husband and my three kids. Did anything happen in the news while I was gone? You may have heard there was a dust up involving yours truly and presidential contender Donald Trump. Mr. Trump was upset with a question I asked... Cute baby. I gotta say I can't stand your show. You guys at Fox, you're doing terrible things to our country. I hope that makes you feel better. How you treat people you disagree with says everything about you. Jesus was a white man, too. He was a historical figure, that's a verifiable fact, as is Santa, I just want the kids watching to know that. But my point is, how do you just revise it, and change Santa from white to black? Oh, hi. Wow, nice dress. I hope you don't wear that to Sunday service. Please, I have church jeans, so I can hood a latte on my knee. Oh my God, Kayla. Did you see this? What? I'm a creep. That is gross. Are you crazy? That's my friend from college. I'm just looking out for you. Who are you stalking? No one. I feel for you. That show. His bark is worse than his bite. I work for Roger, we have two, three and four donut days. Sugar does make everybody crazy. No, these aren't donuts he eats, they're donuts he throws at somebody. No, he's a pussycat. Come say hi, we're always looking for a new talent. Really? Now? Sure. That's Roger's private elevator. Hang on a sec. Hello. Have a seat. Thank you. Liberals don't get Megyn. She's a star, not because she thinks Santa's white. But because she'll say it. That's right. If you have courage in the spotlight, it's powerful to watch. And she went up 30% that quarter. And rather that too. All audience is want is authenticity. For two hundred years, Santa is a fat white guy. They think Santa, that's what they see. You wanna change that? Fine. Let's discuss it without you calling my people racist. Exactly. A liberal is somebody who wants to live in a future that he is too lazy, or too arrogant to actually create. In my family, Santa's always been white. And according to my Grandaddy, a communist. So, that's my family. So, what can I do for you, Kayla? Why did you drop by to see me? The thing is, sir. I actually started on air during college in Central Florida. Weather. I wanna convince you that that is where I belong, Mr. Ailes. I think I'd be freakin' phenomenal on your network. It's Mr. Murdoch's air. But I did create it. I do run it. You have a pretty face. Stand up and give me a twirl. Now? Yeah, just a quick spin. Sure. That's very good. Pull your dress up and let me see your legs. It's a visual medium, Kayla. Come on. Higher. Higher. That's fine, Kayla. Why don't you sit down. Thank you. You have a great body. Thank you. Mr. Ailes. I'd appreciated if you didn't mention... No, of course. I'm here to help my employees, not to hurt them. Anything that happens here, in this room, is strictly between you and me. Okay. Of course, it cuts both ways. I'm discreet, but unforgiving. Success in broadcast television is hard, it's arbitrary. This is the most competitive industry on Earth. You understand what I'm saying? We could work together. I can pluck you out and move you all the way to the front of the line. But I want something in return. You know what that is, Kayla? Loyalty. I need to know that you're loyal. I need you to find a way to prove it. You think about that, all right? So, we'll talk again. Faye can show you the way out. Thank you, sir. Jess. Jess. Something really weird just happened. I just went to say hi to... I just... I met... I was invited to meet Roger. I mean nothing... Nothing happened. Kayla. It's actually better for you if you don't involve me in this. 'Cause they know the workarounds. I'm sorry. Okay. This place is crazy. No Trump! No KKK! No fascist USA! Jesus. Okay, we're here. His assistant's name is Rona. The security guard is Keith. Got it. Gil, last words? Yeah, don't piss him off. I need this job. Good luck. I'll be waiting right here, okay? During the day, if I'm in the office, I have a number of people that I'll just call out a tweet to. It's always my right. You probably had some pretty nasty tweets sent your way, I don't want that to happen but my fans... But you retweet some of those. It's not just the fans. But not the more nasty ones. You would be amazed with the ones I don't retweet. Bimbo? Well, there was a retweet, yeah. Did I say that? Many times. Okay, excuse me. Not the most horrible thing… Over your life Megyn, you've been called a lot worse. Is that right? That's enough. Well, what do you think? I think you're too solicitous. Thank you. With these ones I can handle it straight positive. I'm sorry, he attacks you for a year straight. And you let him off with a fucking "oops." What? I don't let him off. I confront him. I used Donald Trump. Honey, you absolved him. Dough, there are internal political pressures in play here... Yeah, I bet. I get it, Gil. Can we have a second, guys? Please? I'm not trying to be critical, I just... Well, you are! I made this go away. I stopped his harassing bullshit for us. I've never asked you to do that. He is going to be the Republican candidate for President. I'm a news anchor, I need access to him. You need access? At what fucking price? At what price? The price of our apartment. My salary. That pays our fucking bills! Look, for the record... No! It's been a shitty year! Really fucking shitty year, and I'm allowed to won it over! You are. Fuck. Do we really need AR-15s to be able to hunt deer? Protect our families? I'm in favor of people being able to carry handguns. Some of these mass shootings would've been less deadly if that'd been the case. But I'm also with the majority today. Taking a stand against semi-automatic assault weapons, which brings us back to the question of the day. Should Congress reinstate the assault weapons ban? I know a lot of you don't agree with me, that's fine. Eighty nine percent of you say "no." And that what makes America great. Great. The second floor wants to see you. - Now? - Yeah. This is Kayla. Hi. Yeah, I'll come right up then. Ladies. Hey. Hot in here. Gretchen. How are you? Okay. I miss our lunches. Roger wants to see me? No, I think it was Dianne. I just saw her in with Bill. All right. Wow. See you, ladies, later then. Bye. Roger's ready for you, Kayla. Okay. Never stops. Gretchen, you've been such an instrumental part of the Fox family. Absolutely. We just wanted to tell you that we appreciated the work... He firing me, isn't he? Yes. You wanna tell me why? What could they say? You're sexy, but you're too much work. You're a men hater. To get ahead you gotta give a little head. Good luck, Ms. Carlson. Do you know why we dress soldiers the same? So everybody knows they're replaceable. I refuse to be replaceable. I finally did it. I'm out. Did they give you a cause? - No. - Good. Ready to go to war? Oh yeah! I'm ready. Murdoch here. Funny. Have you seen the lawsuit? Which lawsuit? I'm not stopping. Roger is being sued for sexual harassment by Gretchen Carlson. Where's Dad? Paris. Yeah? I have your father's attorney for you. Thank you. Morning, this employee has sued Roger personally. He doesn't know who she is. Are you familiar with Ms. Carlson? Until two hours ago I've never heard about her. More importantly, no one heard from her after she was fired. Wait, not even to negotiate a severance? No, and that suggests she knew it was coming and she had a plan. As News Corp. attorney, I recommend you conduct an internal investigation into Roger's behavior. I know you two have had issues with him. I need everyone's attention! Listen up people! A post employee has received a package of anthrax, that's just above us. Close the goddamn vents! All of them, right now! Roger. Nobody opens the mail! Roger. We're under attack! Don't touch... Roger! Everything upstairs is under control. You need to calm down. Do not give orders in my newsroom! If it was yours, you'd own it. It's okay everyone, everything's gonna be fine. Go back to work. Thank you. Yeah, let's look into her claims. Done. Hi. Oh my God. It's anchor barbie. I'm testing for a Fox Business. Holy fucking Christ! I'll call you right back. Pull up 'The New York Times' right now. Josh. Get me a nice shot for Main street, no pre-seasoning. Right. When you're photographing for my paper, don't wear a hoodie. Okay. Hoodies are creepy. Thank you. Thank you. What is that? Just grocery store sushi. Sushi is not liberal food. I didn't say that it was. Hi, love. Go home. Right now. Don't talk to anybody. What? Roger. I'm making out. Go home, I'll meet you there. What? Fox News host Gretchen Carlson has filed a lawsuit against the network CEO Roger Ailes, claiming she was fired because... Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes is responding to a lawsuit filed by lawyers for Gretchen Carlson... Alleged that she was fired after turning down sexual advances... Carlson claimed in the lawsuit that Ailes took her off the popular morning show 'Fox & Friends' in 2013, cut her pay and placed her in a less desirable afternoon time slot because she refused to have a sexual relationship with him. The lawsuit was filed in New Jersey state court... Champ's making his rounds. Are you okay? Yeah. Beth, I just talked to the Rep. It's an online publication. I say how sad it is. We've got this woman making these complaints, when there are real victims out there. I know Roger. I told 'People' magazine we've been in the office alone a lot over 15 years. I've never seen anything like what I'm reading now. I say I don't even think Gretchen Carlson has a friend in the building. I know Roger, someone would've told me. They gonna quote me on that. Not a ring of truth. Maria Bartiromo send variety of stock chart. - Hey, we're up. - Woohoo. Hannity tweeted: "I talked to hundreds of women at Fox this week" both on air and off, they say it all BS." Brit Hume too. Brit? "Why didn't Gretchen quit and sue, instead of suing only after she got fired?" Why didn't she complain? "Why didn't she complain?" - really? He means the anonymous hotline. - There's a hotline? - Yeah. I did the harassment seminar twice. I never heard about a hotline. Because it's bullshit. They have a contractual right to monitor our communications. A hotline in this building is like a complaint box in occupied Paris. It's like we're telling women, go on, speak up for yourself, just know, the entire network is with Roger. No one will believe you. They'll call you a liar. And as of you career, you want assignments and air time? Go ahead, call the paranoid man who decides you salary, a pervert, and do that on a fucking anonymous hotline he controls on a phone he has a contractual right to record. Jesus fucking Christ! Do you think women are idiots? It's like if somebody striped you naked and they want you to walk through this office just to fucking prove it. Okay. Can I see you for a minute? What the fuck was that? I don't know, but I liked it. I won't call you a feminist, but, say, there's a spectrum, you are... Roger harassed me. Ten years ago. I had turned down a law firm partnership for an entry-level job here at Fox. Roger would call me up to New York, to dingle prospects. I wanted his help. Did you... do anything? No. Will you talk? - Megyn? - I don't know. I don't know. I mean, going on the record... Jesus. That's basically admitting you're the weak one in the herd. No, it's admitting you're the hot one. It has nothing to do with that, Gil. - Say, women? - Oh my God. There is a reason certain women came to fend Roger. If I report this, and it leaks, it will follow me for the rest of my career. I don't wanna be defined by Roger's bullshit. I refuse to be a fucking poster-girl for sexual harassment. He can't still be doing that crap, right? I mean the man is a walker. - Viagra? - Gil! Help me here, please. How do I play this? You only ask when you already know. If I learned anything this year, it's to not get sucked into a fight with someone who has better reason to be in it than you do. Okay. Okay. So, what is it you wanna do? For right now nothing. - Good. - Good. There she is. Roger. Hello, my sweetheart. Sit. Sit. You've met Mayor Giuliani before. Of course. There's an internal investigation, but I'm not gonna wait for it to clear me. The Republican Convention in less than two weeks away. This is bullshit. I'm gonna fight that. The charges are absurd. I met Roger, I love that they'd just given me a chance to repay you from when I was in intensive care. Roger called my idiot doctors every day for four weeks. He told them he'd put me on air live from their hospital bed if they didn't fix every stitch of damage done. But I'm also here as someone who has dealt with this issue for years, years on the side of women. I don't wanna see sexual violence trivialized. I don't wanna see it become some damn political football. In that spirit I need to ask, will an investigation find anything uncomfortable? Define uncomfortable. Roger, quote: "I think you I should've had a sexual relationship a long time ago", and then you'd be good and better and I'd be good and better." - Did you say that? - No, I'm not a fool. You missed your chance for me to harass you? Come on. I think the law give it solicitous. Telling a woman she was fuckable a long time ago. Who the hell thinks that worse? Why is she suing, Roger? Gretchen is a very competitive woman, facing a severe likability issue, one, that I shielded her from for years. Her career is over, I'm afraid. And she can't take a joke. Roger is very salty. I find him amusing. It's my fault, I encourage it. James Murdoch could be behind this, his wife openly supports Hillary. And it could go deeper. I have good reason to believe that inside the Obama White House there've been discussions, on what level I do not know, of having me killed. Oh Jesus. Hi there. Hey. Roger needs you. Your silence is being noticed. The whole point of an investigation is to find the truth, Jeanine. Until that happens I don't have a lot to say. If this charge sticks, the working assumption would be every woman at Fox bent down on her knees, even you. If we sweep this thing under the rug, Jeanine, and it happen again. Under title seven Fox would be liable for compensatory and punitive damages, that could be hundreds of millions. Let's worry about the law before we do the PR, okay? Does Roger want us? Yes. He's a man. He also gave us time, he gave us opportunity. We benefit from that kind of attention. I mean, Jeanine Pirro? She's like the founding member of 'Team Roger'. - You're not answering your phone. - I know. I'm holding it. Everybody is still looking for you. Where were any of these people to defend me from Trump? Bill Shine told them not to. What the fuck?! Our boss. Why are you guys in the hall? I got a call from Roger's lawyers, saying, to quote: "relax." They're convincing Rupert to limit the investigation to Gretchen and her team. That's only five or six women. Are you gonna let that happen? I like Roger, I do. I know. Even if he can be controlling and vindictive. Those sins aren't really the problem, Meg. There are hundreds of stories of Roger paying an employee's rehab, or keeping somebody terminally ill on payroll. You remember when Chuck came out? All Roger said was: "I don't care where you put your paper, as long as you don't tell me where to put mine." Again, not the most redeeming... He promoted me. He's looked past the rejection. He looked past the risk of this exact conversation. He handed me the power to hurt him. Morning. Hi, Megyn. We need to get Gerson Zweifach on the phone. Gerson, I'm calling from Roger. He wants me to be a part of your investigation. We've decided on an outside firm. But why? Gerson, we can handle this ourselves. I'm asking Paul Weiss. Paul Weiss? You tell him that I can actively participate. Mr. Giuliani, you're an old friend of Roger, you've married them. Sharing information with you will remove the cloak of attorney-client privilege making a testimony of any woman who comes forward subject to discovery. I understand, you give me a waver. I will not structure this investigation so Roger isn't perceived of as its target. You wanna glue a guilty? That depends on what we find. Do you know a reporter Gabe Sherman? No. You're about to. He's found six women who claim Roger Ailes harassed them. All from before Roger founded Fox News. This was years ago, he said he would put me on the show, but I had to go to bed with him, and I just said: "Yeah, right, you and who else?" And he said: "Just me and a few of my preferred friends." I came in and he closed the door, turned and kissed me like I was his girlfriend, like he knew it was coming. He grabbed my tits, and he said: "Look, no girl gets a job here unless they're cooperative." If you wanna make it in New York City in a TV business, you'll gonna have to fuck me, and you'll gonna have to do that with anyone I tell you to. He finishes the test, which is me pretending to cook, then he pulls out a garter belt and stockings, and says: "put these on." So, yeah, I put them on. "And he said:" You know, I can really help you, but if you wanna play with the big boys you'll have to lay with the big boys." It was very transactional. It was quiet. He stared at me. He undid his pants and took out his penis, very gingerly. I had never seen one, I was scared. And he said: "kiss it." I was 16. Former anchor Gretchen Carlson filing a sexual harassment lawsuit against Fox News chief Roger Ailes. More women are coming forward. Ailes is denying the allegations... The accusations against Roger Ailes... I have never run a goddamn Dairy Queen. You don't get to go and get whatever you want. Everybody on my shows knows the meaning of decency, and I do mean everybody. A TV outfit needs tough, confident women. Do I push them? You bet your ass I do! But have I ever demanded sex during a casting session? Have I offered extra pay for blowjobs? Give me a goddamn break! Why the hell would I do that?! You know the look in a woman's eye when she's interested? Walk into casting, back then, as the decider, there was a look they gave. I did not always looked like this. I never had to harass anybody, and it's fucking offensive to say that I did! They're trying to change history, for their families. Some of them probably don't even remember what happened. That's gracious of you, Beth. But this is political, I defy you defying any evidence that a single part of what these women are saying is true. Get ready. More will come. We need to let Rupert know what it means if I lose. Gretchen Carlson could kill Fox News! This is a fight for your jobs! If I go you go! If you'd ask me what type of sexual fetish Roger Ailes had, I never would've come up with garter belts, but it's fucking perfect. Their stories are so similar. That doesn't prove much. Sherman met them all through Gretchen's lawyer. They could've been coached. Blowjob thing feels real to me. Does Roger seem like a guy who would get off in that particular power dynamic - yes. The guy who maybe thinks world doesn't really count - maybe. The guy who has reasons to prefer a sex act that lets him keep his clothes on - sure. But it still doesn't make it true. If true, these incidents all happen before Fox started. - Should that matter? - No. Yes. I talked to Gerson Zweifach. And? He asked me to encourage women who have claims to come forward. You remember what happened last time you got between Rupert and Roger? Before I speak out, I need to know if this happened to other women in Fox. You understand that? Is this the one where you really wanna know? Or you wanna look like you really wanna know, but don't? I really wanna know. I'm not always like that. No one around here believes Roger would wanna harass Gretchen. I will send you some of her soapy notes to Roger. "Last night Sandra filled in for Megyn, why not me [smiley face]?" Who sends a harasser a smiley face? - Martin. - Hey, Nancy. - Thanks for coming. - Of course. Hi, Nancy, coffee? Thank you. So, what do you got? No one from Fox has come forward. No one? Rudi Bakhtiar. But no one who's still there? It's been nothing but praise for Roger. Except for Megyn Kelly. She's been unusually silent. Something must've happened to Megyn in the past with Roger. She's way too ambitious not to support him. Possibly. Should you call? Tell her this is a spotlight you'd be happy to share? Megyn? Share? No, she wouldn't do it. - What makes you say that? - Because I wouldn't. I mean Roger plays his women off against each other, he's always done it, he'll say: "Megyn thinks that Lisa should get your spot", or: "Megyn suspects that you're screwing Kal." And then a lawful advice on how to get back at her, as if you brought it up. She's renegotiating her deal. I could still of roughly 15 million reasons to stay quiet. We do need some collaboration. That would certainly help with the other networks. Oh God. What? What Marty? We've not had a lot of incoming job interests from them. What's not a lot? None. They're afraid of Roger. No. No woman gets to sue her boss. Rule #1, corporate America - you don't sue your boss. I jumped off a cliff. I thought one of them would stand with me. - Hey, mom. - Hey, we're home. Hey, honey. There's a snack in the kitchen. - Okay. - Thanks. We gonna get him. Megyn doesn't wanna release a statement. It could be seen as influencing the investigation. Have her say that to Roger's face. Let us know who else hasn't spoken up for him, maybe she can encourage them, privately. No, Jesus! We need our anchors. We need her! Let me talk to her. Yes please. Look, sweetheart, this is an island of safety and truth. I wear pants. No one has ever told me not to wear pants! I wear pants. I'd love to know where that came from. We need everyone on 'Team Roger', everyone. - Hi. - Good morning. Come on. No one makes me wear shirt skirts. He was the first to put a female on as a host of a prime-time show. Roger Ailes champions women. No. There is no leg cam. Could you just hold on for one sec? I have to wear pants on. Not without authorization from the second floor you don't. We never fitted her for pants. You can print whatever story you like, but there is no leg cam. Lily, Beth needs me to talk to Megyn. I'm gonna do an on-air statement where all the Fox women come out one by one behind me for Roger. That will never happen. Ains. You know why Roger's got that door block in his office. 'Cause of Bangladeshi from Accounting wandered in one day by mistake. Please. It's so girls can come in from the back elevator and no one sees them. Really? We get talent come in here all the time, looking to get their faces done. "I'm going to see Roger, I gotta look my best." One came back up with her robe off and nose in chin. Who was that? My memory is horrible. You should go see Jenis in Weather. Nobody wants to talk. Can you blame them? No. Where'd you disappear to? I've got names. Women rumored to have stories about Roger. - From who? - Jenis. Weather Jenis? Everybody confides at her. "Nobody from weather wants your job." What are gonna do with them? Tell them this time's different. Wait... No. Don't wait. Don't listen to him. It's not only your job here. I got kids, okay? Lily has a baby now. Julia'll lose her visa and will have to go back to Canada. We know that you've been talking to broadcast networks. You can get a job anywhere, but we can't. And no offense, but who the hell will you be? Nobody leaves Fox, Megyn. Not really. It's in your DNA now. Think about what you're blowing up here. I say find the truth. That face tells me nothing. If they come after you, it won't be you they come after. Gretchen Carlson, your colleague at Fox News, has issued some allegations, some sexual harassment allegations, over your boss Roger Ailes. What is your position on this? What did you think when you heard this? In this country every famous, powerful and wealthy person is a target. You're a target. I'm a target. Anytime somebody could come out and sue us, attack us, go to the press or anything like that. And that's a deplorable situation. I've worked for Roger Ailes for 20 years. Best boss I've ever had. I've never been told what I can't wear. I know you didn't ask, but I think it needs to be said. It's a very confusing time right now. Tonight is Manhattanhenge. Sunset will align perfectly with the city's grid. The best viewing streets are 14th, 34th and 57th. Good day New York. A babe with no kiser? This can't be a Fox affiliate. Oh my God. How are you? Good. How about you? Good. How's your mom? She's good. She's training to be a security guard. Is that because of the Trump stuff? No, she just wants a job where she gets to carry a gun. Did you come up here to talk about Roger? What would make you say that? I've been in local for two years, nobody's ever come to see me. You miss us? The network I worked at for 14 years, that my dad helped built, where my brother's a reporter? Julia, did Roger ever...? No. I heard things, but nothing firsthand. Good. - I miss you. - I miss you more. We should go have a drink. Yes. Roger... He has... detectives on staff, about 14. They look into enemies, follow them. Post negative stories online. It's called the 'Black Room'. I don't want you in danger... No. No. I'm not talking about me. I'm talking about you. Be careful who you ask questions about Roger Ailes. My lawyers are negotiating with Fox. Not that Bill will pay any of it. Bill? O'Reilly. And Jack. Jesus. Sorry. Fish rots from the head. I'm gonna talk to the outside firm investigating this. Paul Weiss. I heard you had some issues over here. I did. If you have a name to give. Roger. I wouldn't ask if I didn't think it was safe. Roger. Jack. Roger. Doug. Jack. Francisco. Bill. Roger. It's Kayla, right? Yeah. Hi. Hi. Megyn. I know. You used to work with Gretchen, right? Did you learn a lot from her? I did. Yes. I have nothing but good things to say about her. That's great. I always find it so interesting who history chooses to do something important. I guess. I wanted to ask you... I wanted to ask you if Roger is harassing you. How did you know? We find each other. You too? Long time ago. Wow. Are you okay? You should report Roger. You'll be protected. Did you? I took it to his superior. Nothing happened. I had to drop it. Why? I wanted to be on television. Did you think what your silence would mean for us, the rest of us? Roger is not my fault. It would've been nice... if somebody told us that he's after more than legs. That's nobody's job to protect you, Kayla. That's all of our job. I don't get you, you're... you have power. Why are you still playing by old rules? You're Megyn Kelly. Look around, snowflake. How do think I succeeded? How do you think a woman gets a prime time Fox show? So, you had sex with him? Jesus fucking Christ. Hello. Hey. It's me. Oh my God! What the fuck, Kayla? It said Bill in my phone. Sorry, I saved my number under his name in your phone, as a joke. I forgot. Oh my God. Jesus Christ. I had a heart attack. Where are you? I'm on a date. Okay. Did you... Did you give my name to Megyn by any chance? I may have... worried about you out loud, once or twice. Why didn't you just... support me? I don't even know. I couldn't do anything and I... I can't fuck up. 'Cause I'm a lesbian at Fox News. So? Who's your date with, Kayla? I can't just go on a date with a dude and make it go away. I think I'm... I think I'm gonna call Paul Weiss. Okay. That's good. That's really good. I'm really glad you're doing that. I think that's absolutely what you should do. Okay. Great. I can't call anyone else and I just... I need someone right now to... tell me that that's what I should do. Oh my God. Yes. I heard it was like an outside firm, and they're taking it really seriously. Okay. Great. Thanks. Kayla. What happened? I did it. I did it. I gave it to him. Kayla, I... I'm so sorry. He kept talking, he just kept talking, kept saying... "Good girl. That's a good girl. You're a good soldier." "Earn your place." Fuck. He didn't even unbuckle. I feel so filthy. No. Kayla. You didn't do anything wrong. I'm sorry. I better go. Roger can sense vulnerabilities. In those days our meetings were career strategy sessions, mixed with good advice, and comments like. The most basic thing is confidence. Feel at home in your own skin. If you're confident, you're sexy. I'm sure you have some sexy bras. I'd love to see you in those. It was a cat-and-mouse game. But he always gave me good advice and let me deflect. Tell him to dream on. The more I let him get away with the more he pushed my buttons. I don't know if women can be good interviewers. Men have that killer instinct, and we do bad things, and we do not feel guilty about it. How can I be sure you have that... that kind of drive? Finally, in January. This is '06? Yes. He grabbed me. Tried to kiss me. I pushed him away twice. As I was leaving, he asked: "when is your contract up?" After the third time I left. And he never tried anything again? No. I ignored his calls. Stayed in D. C. Two years later I had a show. Any long-term consequences? Yeah... Am I witness "W"? Yes. Why? It's a 23rd letter in the alphabet. Have 22 other women come forward since I first spoke to you? Have they? Will there be more? A major bombshell this morning. Star anchor Megyn Kelly has informed lawyers that Fox News CEO Roger Ailes sexually harassed her... For her to level these allegations is devastating against Ailes... We are seeing the end of an era at Fox News... It was a dagger in his heart, in some way. The notion that Megyn Kelly was among his accusers. What? What?! Yes! Yes! Roger. What's the matter? Megyn's claiming I harassed her. You saw a Gabe's Sherman post? James has been feeding him bullshit! Come through Megyn's press. Find every single positive thing she said about me, and get it out, now! Roger, I can't discredit an anchor on pay to promote. Then I'll hurl her in the Fox hole with you. Leak something to Breitbart or to Drudge. I'll talk to Susan... - I'm sorry, Roger. - Do something! At least get some shit about Gretchen out there! These women are trying to fuck me! I have no answers for you. I don't really know. Thanks. Hey, Gil. Hey, Greta. What's Megyn singing? It's part of a contract negotiation? It's not economic, or political. Okay, Gil. This is scary, It's like the whole world's on fire and no one can be trusted. Hey, Geraldo, CNN, line six. Can't talk. He is certainly in 'Times'. Why aren't you on the phone? To comment on sexual harassment. We work for Bill. 'Team Roger'. Hey, we need you to wear it. - No. - Are you kidding? No! Get it on. Megyn Kelly has no comment. She's traveling... To Cleveland. For the Republican Convention, remember? I've known him for 40 years. And he's about as flirty as the grizzly, when you rub on it. Let me tell you something. I called these allegations sick, 'cause they are sick. Why wasn't I let in on a pact? What pact? Breitbart is saying there is a pact among our top 50 on-air talents. If Roger gets fired, we all walk. - Great, where do I sign? - I've never heard of a pact. Me neither. Roger placed it. Fake news. Come on. How bad does it look for Roger? Bad. Doesn't feel like I imagined it would. Gretchen, you achieved something remarkable. Yes. I did. Mom. I think it's time we finish this. Okay. I'll let you know. Mom, are you done with that? I'm done. I made the Murdochs 1.5 billion in profit last year. Pure profit. Fox News is the most successful cable franchise in history. Gretchen Carlson's lawyers. She wants to settle. It's a lot less appealing to sue you personally without Rupert's money behind you. Hey, Ken. Ken? - Hey. Who's here? - Oh my Gosh. I brought you some small people. We practiced that scare for two weeks. Look at you. Hi. Look who's here? It was so scary. Thank you. How are you, sweetheart? I'm either damned for doing it, or damned for not doing it sooner. Tell me my big mouth didn't ruin our life. Not yet. Can I speak to Roger alone, please? Are you sure you want Beth here? Of course. Gretchen taped your conversations. That's a goddamn lie! For over a year. But, you don't believe her. Your quotes in her lawsuit, they're from tapes. What? Why didn't they tell us before? So you'd issue complete denials. So you'd have no credibility. Apparently, she did her homework. God Bless our next President Donald Trump. And God Bless the United States of America! Mr. Giuliani is fired up. When we come back we'll discuss the speech with the man who helped drive it. Don't react, okay? Roger's out. Is that sourced, Gil? Yeah. The 'New York Post'. They put him on the cover. Rupert's telling him to let go. And that's a scoop. We gonna win so big. Thank you very much. There is some breaking news tonight in the world of media and politics... A blockbuster shake-up at Fox News... A dramatic fall from grace... Roger Ailes is out as top boss. They want us to circle the block. Hold on. What's going on? I've been shut down. It's true. Everything Richard said. It's all true. Roger lied to me. Why? Because I'm a mandra here. So, I have concerns my public defense in Roger can be construit as coercive. Hey. Pants. Fuck off, Neil. Sorry to keep you waiting. No. No. Sit down. I appreciate you driving up here, Roger. Susan Estrich. I hate that it's come to this. Me too. We gave these women jobs. Put them on the air. Made them famous. You think for a goddamn second I did any damage to any of them? No, you don't. You don't, Rupert. There's now audience for that side of the story. To begin with, half of this you already owe him from last year's bonus. And we're paying it. And paying off your contract. Consider yourself lucky. It's a contractual obligation. I created the Murdoch family's most profitable asset. A third of your margin. There are three of you. I guess that means I pay for the food that one of you puts in your mouth. What if it's you. I'd have fired you for cause... Roger, you've built an amazing business. No one can take that away from you. But, under the circumstances... This is a lot of money. It won't look good to the people that don't know your worth. Take it. Honor your non-compete. I never cared about the money. We know, Roger. Okay. Okay. I'd like to go to the newsroom with you. I'd like us to announce my leaving together. No. The end of the legman. I won't miss him. Boys. Hope you two know what you're doing. Once Roger's office is cleared off handguns, I'll move in. I'll run the network till the ship's aride. Donald. How's that speech coming? Megyn's gotta go! Ho ho ho! Convention's downstairs, folks. Would you say people are shocked? Come on. What'd he do to you? Megyn? Of all the ways this could end. I didn't see this one coming. Gretchen Carlson got the Murdochs to put the right of women above profit, if only temporarily. And I found myself with the job I didn't want. I couldn't really leave. Even when I did. You should keep that out. People, can I get your attention please? Mr. Murdoch is joining us today, he has a very important statement he'd like to say. Excuse me, everyone. I won't take long. Roger Ailes is leaving Fox. I want to start by thanking Roger for his remarkable contribution to our company, and to our country. Twenty years ago Roger shared... Here's the thing about being sexually harassed at work. It condemns you to questions. You keep asking yourself: what did I do? What did I say? What did I wear? What did I miss? Am I seen as weak? Will they say I'm after money? Will they say I'm after attention? Will I be left out? Will I be defined by this for the rest of my life? I will take over as chairman and acting CEO with the support of our existing management team under Bill Shine. If I stay do I just have to put up with it? Will the next place be different? Or can I make it different? Roger always said: "Everyone on television only has one real job - to be likable." Well, I don't care if you like me. Only that you believe me. A lot of people, even women, are skeptical of harassment claims, until they experience it themselves. Or know someone who has. I may be that person for you. As you could see. It's 20 million.
