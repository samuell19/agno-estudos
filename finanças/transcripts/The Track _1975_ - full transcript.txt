in original screenplay and dialogues based on an idea by serge r. leroy with with the friendly participation of and the help of music by production management camera operator assistant directors script supervisor sound film editing executive producer cinematography directed by serge r. leroy Villeherviers! -Everything good? -Yes. Hi. Villeherviers! -Is that the Molette hotel over there? -Yes. Is it closed? I don't think so. Oh, it's Sunday, you know. That's alright, I'll wait. Oh, they won't be long. -Here... Your return ticket. -Ah, thanks. There's a train to Alençon at noon, right? 12:02. -You like it? -It's beautiful. It's a bit risky. Only men buy this kind of thing. Jeanne will never guess a woman gave it to you. I was thinking of someone else, too. David? He wanted one, actually. He didn't buy it, I don't know why. -He'll recognize it. -What does it matter? You can buy a rifle by yourself. Yes, of course. -What's the matter? -Oh, nothing. David leaves you in peace, we know that. But don't forget I can't take any risks. Ah, Philippe... My father-in-law would get rid of me straight away if he knew. You're still his grandchildren's father. Oh, if you think that matters... Kiss me. I need to go now. Are you going home straight away? Not until tonight. And you? What did you tell Jeanne? That I'll stay at Maurois'. Don't do that, Francoise. -It's not loaded. - I know, but you can't do that. -You're already smoking? -The last one... or the first one. -Who will be there? -The usual gang. Your breakfast will be brought to the room. -When will you go? -Oh, I'm not in a hurry. In two or three hours. Take it with you. It will bring you good luck. -See you next Tuesday? -Of course. The taxi was called away on an emergency, it'll be back within an hour, an hour and a half. I figured I could take the noon train. There is another one at four, that way you will have more time to visit. If you decide to rent La Guetiére, you will need a car. It's very secluded, you know. -Good morning, Mr. Mansart. -Good morning, Mrs. Molette. -You can bring the breakfast to the room. -Alright. I'll come back tonight to pick up my things. -Have a good day, Mr. Mansart. -Thanks. The only people you will see at La Guetiére are hunters. And only during the hunting season. It used to be a windmill, it's been really well arranged. -Please bring that up with the breakfast. -Right. -Excuse me, you're going to La Guetiere? -Yes. It's on my way, I can give you a lift if you want. That's a great idea, you'll get there faster. Here's the key. Don't forget to bring it back when you're back. I will tell the taxi to pick you up around 11, that way you will catch your noon train. -It doesn't bother you? -Philippe Mansart. -Helen Wells. -Follow me. -Good bye. -Good bye. You want to buy La Guetiere? Maybe I'll rent it during weekends. You must enjoy being alone. The weather is not really nice during this time of the year. It doesn't bother me. Are you moving up to this area? I'm a teaching assistant at the Caen University. You know the area, then. Not much. I have friends in Alençon. Professor Juillet and his wife. Ah, you're a friend of the Juillets! We might have already met. I'm Auguste Marjorie's son-in-law. Do you know the Marjorie stores? -No. -You will. My father-in-law is a senator, he controls everything around here. Friends. The Danvilles. Idiots! They're a bit crazy. Don't worry, they're like kids. -Let them pass. -It's not that easy. Well, Mansart, you're chickening out? -Idiot. -Slow down. Please. Bastards! -The house is 100 meters from here. -Thanks again. -See you soon, I hope. -Goodbye. Hello. You could introduce us, Mansart. Just a minute, mate. Helen Wells. Paul Danville, Albert Danville. These gentlemen are scrap iron merchants, which explains their disregard for the body of their car and their friends' cars. Take it easy, Mansart. Well, goodbye. Goodbye. Are you American? -No. -British? Yes. Come with us, we're going to hunt pigs. -Wild boars. -Ah... No, I don't think I would like it. Too bad... Nice job, congratulations. Don't worry, we'll buy you a brand new one. I'm counting on it. Who's that? Where did you find her? On the road. And she fell into your bed, right? Nice job, Albert, congratulations. Shit. That kind of girl makes me hard. Even when I'm sober. Sober, sober... or not! Right? This shed is falling apart. I don't want to spend a fortune to fix it. But that's where we put the machines. Put them somewhere else. You have plenty of room. Maybe... I'll talk about it with your husband when we handle the farming accounts. Is the fence for the Longueville fields done? Almost. It's still missing about 50 meters, actually. I went there yesterday. You'd better take care of the traps, Maurois. There's never been so many. It's not true, Mr. Sutter. I swear I keep an eye on this poacher. There are no traps on your hunting ground. -I wouldn't bet my life on it. -Well, well, well. -Hello, everybody. -Hello, Mr. Rollin. -Hello my friend. -Mrs. Leuillot. Dear David. It's chilly this morning. How are you, Maurois? Hello, Mr. Rollin. -It was freezing cold at church. -What an idea... -To be a good Christian? -Do you want some soup? No, I'll have some ham. Tell me, Rollin. The Pichons are clients of yours? Yes, they've always been. What do they plan to do with their grounds in Saint Jean le Blanc? Are you interested? Yes, if they're not too greedy. You must have some influence over them. A notary doesn't have much influence, you know. You think you can obtain the building permit? After the departmental council elections, yes. Mansart? It would be better if the Pichons were unaware of it. Yes, but they are almost friends, so... All the more reason. I'm going to try to fix that for you. You know I never forget those who have done me a favor. Here are the Danvilles and Mr. Mansart. It bothers me that you always invite the Danvilles. I must admit I find them amusing. I don't. -So, how are you, bad boys? -We're feeling great, David. -Paul and I are taking all the bets. -Yes, Sir! Well, we'll see. -Take care of the dogs, Maurois. -Come and have something to eat. -How are you, Rollin? -Fine, thanks. -Is that ham any good? -Yes. What did you cook for us, Fernande? Please, gentlemen, behave yourselves. Don't worry, Mr. Sutter. These two say more than they do. Not everybody is like that. Don't let her say that, Mr. Sutter. Go fetch the wine, Maurois, will you? Bring us some wine, Maurois, for God's sake! Maurois, we're thirsty. The priest didn't give you enough host to eat, notary? Please don't blaspheme, Danville. -Whose hat is this? -Very clever. Have a drink. Here, Mr. Albert. -Why are you sulky, Maurois? -I'm not sulky, Mr. Danville. When I think of Fernande... I thought you would be here... I called at your home last night and Jeanne told me you were spending the night at Maurois'. Yes, that was my plan, but I changed my mind. Along the way? - Mr. Rollin! -Do you want some soup, Mr. Mansart? Yes, with a lot of cabbage, Mrs. Leuillot. Cabbage will make you pee, Mansart. If I were with a chick like the one we saw him with, it isn't cabbage that I would eat. What's this chick story? What chick? Gentlemen, I'd appreciate your discretion. What was her name? Isn't she a British chick? Who laughs when she gets a dick! What? -Philippe, do I know her? - don't think so. -A friend of Juillet. -The psychiatrist? She must be a loony if she knows Juillet. -And how is she in bed? -Crazy, of course. -Hello, gentlemen. -You had a safe trip? We almost crashed. In the middle of a bend, Chamond wanted me to avoid a rabbit, the road is wet, the car drifted, we almost ended up in the ditch. Mrs. Leuillot, please serve these gentlemen. What do you want, cooked ham or cured ham? Some cured ham. Hello, Mrs. Leulliot. Hey, here's a meal o' wurst. That's right. Lucky he managed to straighten up, or else... we would have ended in the ditch. -You must have been scared stiff. -Chamond can't get stiff. Let them talk, Chamond. -Of course, I let them talk. -No, thanks, Mrs. Leuillot. Anyway, everybody knows they are fools. - I put this terrine aside. -Thanks, Maurois, how are you? -So ? -Keep going! What's the schedule, David? Maurois spotted two places. A lone boar in the woods and a herd of 2 or 3 animals in Maltourné. -How's your husband, Fernande? -Great, thanks. -Not too much work at the farm? -No shortage of work here. A man came to hunt here last year. He's got a big garage on the road to Alençon. Tell me, Claude, I heard you lost your niece. -Yes, last week. -My God. He's going to close his business, he's broke, there's no more work. You should meet him. What about Marie-Danielle? He doesn't want you to lend him money but maybe you could... I won't lend him money, my clients will. After all, it's a creditworthy and healthy business. She had been sick for six months. What are you going to do with the inheritance? Nothing works these days, you know it as good as me. How is business? Oh, it's always good for notaries. You knew her well? Well, it's Roseline who hooked me up with her. Another day laborer would be fine. -Ask your boss. -Well... you know him. Mrs. Leulliot, I'll have some more wine please. -I'll have a quick word with him. -That's nice of you Mr. Nimier. You're always ready for a quick one. I was wondering when you were going to say something. -It's a pretty good field. -Around seventeen acres. -Some more? - Well there. -You're forgetting about me lately. -I never forget about you Mr. Albert. She was in pain for the last 3 weeks. It's been very hard. -Leave her alone. -I'm only giving her a kiss. One of these days, you'll get in trouble telling things about me like you did earlier. Poor Maurois. Isn't it true you'd rather have fun with little girls? I did nothing wrong, you hear me? Nothing. The little girl, I don't know why she got scared, she screamed, that's all. Poor kid. Seeing you like that, Maurois, with crazy eyes, I can understand why she screamed. Don't say that. I didn't do anything. Maybe, but without Mr. Sutter, the police would have taken you, and you would still be rotting in prison. Maurois? Bitch. Alright, I'm taking bets today. - Really? -What's your first bet? -I'll bet... - I don't know... -1000 francs on my brother. -OK. As usual. What about you, David? -2000 on Nimier for me. -Who put sugar in there? 2000 on Nimier? He's the favorite! He doesn't take any risk, does he? -What about you, Mansart? -500 on Chamond. -Well, aren't you lucky? - I am. -What about you? -The captain, 2000. -Alright, the captain. And you, bunny? -Give me the dough. Hey, the notary is running away! I hate this stupid tradition, but I'll do like everyone else. 2000 on Nimier. You're scared of losing your bread? My bread, as you say, was earned hard and clean, that's why I don't want to lose it. In the scrap iron field, money doesn't stink more than anywhere else. I never said that. What about you Nimier? Nobody put a bet on you, so I will. My brother put a bet on me! With the amount of alcohol you had today, I doubt you'll get anything. -What's that? - No, don't touch it. Come on, gentlemen, let's hurry please. -Put the window up. -Let's not waste time, please. Chamond, wait, I've got the trunk keys. -Come on, Chamond! - Just a minute. Well, a new weapon? May 1? Oh my, it's stunning. Must have cost a little fortune? Indeed. Excuse me. It would have been easier with a machine gun. Oh, shut up, Nimier, you do it with a rifle! -You shouldn't, Mr. Paul. -Oh, shut up, Maurois. -Come on. Go fetch, Rex. -Here, dog. They hunt as bad as they drink. My eyesight is not so good today. I almost missed it. At least four pounds. There, Paul. Four pounds? There, Chamond. -Shit. You're disgusting. -Cut the crap. There, Maurois. It didn't bite you, did it? Come on dogs, come on, Rex, come. Come on dogs. Come on. -Mangin came by. -Yes, I sent him. Yes, I know. Thank you, by the way. You're welcome. I sold him the new Ford and he needed good insurance so I told him to go to you. Take good care of him, he's loaded. Oh well, I think I got him a pretty nice contract. Nice for you, right? So, you're running for it, it's settled? Yes, my father-in-law approved of it. He'll have at least one department councilor on his side. I'm going to support your campaign, too. There will be no shortage of money. The others will support you too. I think it's in their best interest. Not yours? -Well then, good luck, gentlemen. -Yeah. Sure. Don't jinx it. Captain, Chamond, you go that way. Mr. Paul, Mr. Albert... A bit more on the left, Mr. Paul. Say, Maurois... 100 francs for you if you manage to get the pig through the gap, there. When you track it down, the pig can come out anywhere, Mr. Danville. It wouldn't be fair for me to accept. Two-faced bastard. -It's chilly, isn't it? - It's a bit damp. In an hour, the wind will turn. Don't you worry, we will have tracked it down before then. Say, Captain... I'll bet that you've walked past the right path. This one, right over there. Well, I'll go then. Maurois. I don't like to be favored. Noted? Noted, Captain. "Delagrange", special vintage, do you want some? No, thank you. You should, it's excellent. Rollin, what about you? No, thank you. You know that I don't drink. -Do you want to warm up your hands? -Thanks. You're well equipped. For sure, I'm an organized man. Nothing is left to chance with me. Here comes Maurois. Mr. Sutter could cover the left side, Mr. Mansart, the center with me, and Mr. Rollin, the other side. Okay then, let's go. Nervous? I don't like having guns loaded behind my back. Focus on your side, Mr. Sutter, it can turn back. Don't worry, Maurois, my gun is loaded. Come on, dogs. Come on. It's here. Come on, dogs. Come on, come on. Ah, damn it. Careful it doesn't turn back. It's for them, Mr. Mansart. Well done, Maurois. Chamond, you're on! Shit! Shit, shit, shit. What the hell is with you? -Huh? -Okay, I know... I can't believe it. Why don't you change your glasses? Ah, that's smart. Did it run off between your legs? So, what's going on? It's Chamond, he's completely blind. Come on guys, it's not my fault. Shut up. He missed a boar at 2 meters, I mean... The captain came across a Fellaga there in the woods. Come on, catch him. -Come on, Chamond, come on. -Stop it! Goddammit! Tell me, Maurois, I almost got my feet trapped in this. Fucking poacher. I swear, if I catch him, I'll give him a hard time. Why does it bother you, David? A few little traps? You don't hunt rabbits. Property is property. Whether it's a rabbit or something else. We could be heading towards Maltourné, Mr. Sutter. Some apple, Philippe? The trackers on one side, the shooters on the other. It would save us some time. The captain can join us later. Especially since it's a long way. Okay, let's go, gentlemen. -We'll meet in Maltourné. -Okay, alright, let's go. Come on. -Some coffee, Albert? -Leave me alone, with your stupid coffee. What's wrong with you? Listen to me, next time you miss a pig, Paul and I will cut your balls off. Hell yeah! Chamond's balls. For a pig. You're both completely drunk. -Oh, don't make that face. - Stop it! It's scratchy, isn't it? Go, go, dog. What's with Rex, Paul? -This idiot thought you were... -Can't you hold him? Rex, shut up. Well, there! What are you doing here? I was looking at the statuette. -Ah ? -Do you want it? It's fine right where it is. -What's going on? - Oh, don't shoot, Chamond. No, it's Rex who's got the wrong animal. You don't like dogs. That's something they can feel. I am sorry. -You're leaving? -Yes. Chamond, can't you offer the lady a coffee? Would you like some? Yes, I would. -Did you like La Guetiere? -Very much. It's nice, isn't it? Are you planning on moving there? I don't know yet, maybe. Be careful, it's very hot. Thank you. It tastes good. -It warms you up, huh? -Yes, it's hot. Anyway, if you come live in the area, it will be a pleasant company, won't it Paul? Sure, we wouldn't complain about it. Don't count too much on me for your amusements. Oh, we have other ones, you know. If you live at La Guetiére, Mr. Mansart will be happy about it. You don't like dogs, but you have nothing against men? Thanks for the coffee. Come on, Paul, I don't understand. Why did you say that? The lady is going to think you're jealous of Mansart. He meant that he wishes he could be as lucky as him. Don't listen, Miss, these two must always joke around. I have to go. Are you angry? If you leave us like this, we'll think that we're bothering you. Yes, that's right. Now, you're bothering me. Let go of me. -Don't you think you're going too far? -Shut up. Rex. Come on, stop being stupid now. Call him back. -Come on, Rex. -Leave us alone, Chamond. What's on your mind, Paul? But what are you doing? No, you are... Come on, stop! Stop, you idiots! I warn you, I'm not a part of this. Shut up, Chamond. You guys are bastards, both of you. -Hear that? -It comes from La Guetiére. Let's get out of here. Let's go, for God's sake, Chamond. What's Nimier doing? That's a good question... Maurois, show Mr. Danville and Chamond where to stay, -we're waiting for your signal. -Alright, Mr. Sutter. What's with you? -Nothing, we messed up. -Nah... Don't worry. Doesn't she know Mansart? Listen, she's not going to tell him. -The honking has stopped. Is it gone? -Come on, enough. Shit, my rifle. I can't believe it. -Go get it. -It's okay. I'll go. Hey, come help me. It weighs at least 80 kilos. Oh, well done. You're still here? I came back for the... Well done. You wouldn't know how to use it. Give it to me. Paul! -My little Paul, what is it? -Don't touch me. Goddammit. I thought she... I didn't see it coming, you know. I told you it would go wrong. Don't move, we're going to take care of you and then... Then, I swear I'm gonna take care of her. No, it's her... We've got to catch her otherwise she's gonna talk now. She's got no other choice now. To defend herself. She shot me, you understand? We can't leave you like this. Listen, I'm telling you, it's not that bad. Run after her, and... Offer her a deal. -We'll keep our mouth shut and... -And she keeps her mouth shut, right? Right, give and take. You can tell the others it was an accident. Yes. It's going to come out eventually. If she agrees, no one will know. It's between her and us. Don't be stupid, Chamond, you're in this with us. -I didn't do anything. -You were there, weren't you? She got Paul with your rifle, it's all your fault. Hurry up, or we're screwed. Listen, you go get the others. Tell them it's an accident and that you're going to get - the ambulance and the cops. -The cops? That's what they must believe. Then, you'll go hide in the Legrand quarry and you don't move. Until I come and tell you that it's okay with the girl. -And Paul? -Come on, go, come on. Hurry. Don't mess up, Chamond. I don't want to go to jail too. You're sure you'll be okay? Don't worry, it hurts but it's not serious. There, hold this against you. Okay, don't you worry about a thing, mate. What happened to you, Mr. Paul? Something stupid. Give me some water. Put down that phone and listen to me. We can sort this out. It doesn't work. And that's lucky, you were going to do something stupid. Huh? Come on, open the door, darling. We'll have a quiet talk... David! What's going on? David! David! Listen to me, damn it. What's up with you? Where are you going? Come on. I'm telling you, we just want to work it out. Come on, come back. Why do you run off like this? To go get the cops? What are you gonna tell them, that you shot my brother? You can't prove anything. So it's best to reach an agreement, for you and for us. Don't run away, for God's sake! Damn. You were right, Mansart, she really is crazy. It's okay, Paul, Chamond told us everything, he went to get the ambulance. She didn't do it on purpose. And why did she have a gun? It's Chamond... To show her. Loaded, on top of that, how unsafe. Don't make him talk. It's gonna be fine. We'll save some time if we go get a car. You're not gonna drag me down the road, I'm telling you it can wait. What do you think Nimier? It's always impressive in the stomach, it bleeds like hell. -Show me. -I'd rather not. We know how you treated your Fellagas. As you want. Come on, Miss, stop. Dammit, she's nuts. Why is Albert not coming back with this woman? And why did she run away? She got scared. Albert and Chamond were taking care of me, they didn't see her go. One of us should go and see what Albert is doing. Yeah, no need for us all to stay here. I'll go. -Don't leave me. -Of course not. Go on you guys, I'll stay with him. Let Albert take care of it, he'll come back with her. Probably. But in the meantime, stay still. Take this, Rollin, and give it to him if he's cold. Don't worry Paul, the ambulance will be here soon. Go have a look at La Guetiére and meet me up there. I don't like this, you know. It's only an accident, sure... but God knows what these stupid reporters are going to write about it. Don't you think it could be a problem for you, Philippe? Not more than for anyone else. Well, you're the one who spent the night with this woman. Of course it has nothing to do with what happened but still... she could talk, and mentioning a future department councilor could be good for her. She won't. Do you know her that well? Of course, you could say that she's lying. People will believe you, of course. Listen. If it can help you... I'm prepared to say that you were not with her last night. That won't be necessary. Well then, good for everyone. So? The back door's open and there's a broken pane. Really? Look. -Is that her? -Who else could it be? David! Albert and the girl are running over there. What the hell are you doing here, couldn't you stay with Paul? Rollin is with him. Chamond left to get the ambulance. But what's going on with that woman? Don't you see? She's getting the hell out of here. She's there, on the other side, I see her, she's going away. It's your turn guys, I'm done. I think she's in there. -There's something wrong, Captain. -What is wrong, Maurois? What the hell are you doing? She's getting way ahead. So, are you going or what? Yeah, we're coming. What the Danvilles and Mr. Chamond say. You know something? I wouldn't like to make a fuss or to get in trouble. -Where did you find this? -At the chapel. Maybe it isn't hers and it doesn't prove anything. Bastards. Oh, I must have sprained my ankle. Hey, take the others with you. Albert, what the hell is going on? That girl is crazy, don't let her get away. You go after her, I can't anymore, I'm exhausted. What do you mean by "get away"? Where could she go? After all, we can let the police handle it. Oh, I've had enough of this thing. She's in the tunnel. What is she trying to do? It's dangerous in the tunnel. Nimier thinks she's in the tunnel. No, I'm telling you she's on the other side. Albert, I don't know what you're up to, but Maurois and I are sure that she's hidden in there. -Okay then, I'll go. -No! Stay right where you are. You're only scaring this woman away. Go on, Philippe. She knows you, at least. -She doesn't know what she's doing. -Talk some sense into her. That's enough. Did you hurt your ankle? Philippe. Philippe. Let me go in there, Philippe. What do you want from this woman, Albert? Didn't you see what she did to Paul? I did and I'd like to understand. Miss Wells? What did you mean by "What is Albert up to"? Maurois found this in the chapel. Miss Wells? Miss Wells? That's all I know, Mr. Sutter. I only picked this up. What does that mean? It means that they must have banged her, and of course she didn't want to. That explains why Paul has his guts out. Are you crazy? I'm not. The Danvilles are. And they know they're in trouble. And so are we. Miss Wells? It's me, Mansart. Can you hear me? Don't be afraid, show yourself. Come. You have nothing to fear. -Who's with you? -Friends. Danville too? Why? What happened? Come, let's not stay here. Come. Walk behind me. Danville, I need to talk to you. Leave me the hell alone. It's not the right time. She's coming. Come. Don't be scared. Trust me. I don't want to talk to anyone. Bring me to the police. Come back! What the hell, have you gone insane or what? Fuck, don't let her get away. Stop him, Nimier. What's got into you? If she talks, we're all screwed. Tell me. Why would we all be screwed? Because these bastards raped her. Chamond had forgotten his rifle, Paul went back to get it and she shot him. Do you realize, Danville, what situation you have put us in? That's why we must catch her and make a deal with her. After shooting her? She mustn't go to the cops. What kind of a deal? She shuts up, we shut up. But what do we have to do with this? We haven't done anything. We won't be your accomplices, what you have done is awful. If she gets away, there will be no deal, she'll talk. And we'll all be in trouble, whether you want it or not. We walk together, David? Right? Albert? Chamond didn't go to the cops or to get an ambulance? No, he's hiding, he won't move until I tell him to. If it drags on, your brother could die. No, I know Paul. He'll be okay. We shouldn't leave him alone, he's gonna screw up again. Wait for me, I'm coming. Maurois, go with the captain. -But... -Do as I say. I don't see why... Remember what you did and how I got you out of it. -It's not true what they said, Mr. Sutter. -Go or you're fired. You should go too, Philippe. They can all go to hell. You're not in the best position on this case. I'm talking about last night, you were with her, right? No. You fool. Come on, hurry up. We must cover all this up at any cost. -How? -Huh? By talking some sense into this woman. Don't forget that she shot Paul, she's not innocent either, she must understand that. -What if she doesn't? -Money convinces everybody. You're disgusting, David. I have decided to settle this case for everybody's sake, including yours, and I'll leave you no choice. How? You know how. I'll bring you down in front of Jeanne and your father-in-law and without the Marjorie's fortune, you're nothing. You'd run the risk of being ridiculous? Oh, not more than you. And don't count on Francoise to get you out of this, I got her used to luxury, you wouldn't fit the bill. -Do you have a light? -Of course. Let's go. Rollin! Rollin! I'm here. -Oh, I thought... -Don't worry. I'm just wondering what they're doing. Why aren't Chamond and the cops already here? And on top of it... I'm cold. You're not planning on drinking in your condition? No, it's for you. I don't drink anymore. You know that. I know, but it'll warm you up. It's not an ordinary day. That's true. It's strong. I had forgotten. Go on, some more. It warms me up, it's true. But it's not too good for reflexes. The game is over. My reflexes will have come back by next Sunday. It's funny. What? I didn't know you could laugh. How do you feel? A bit gross. That's nothing. Thank you. Thank you for staying with me, Rollin. It's only natural. No, it can't be, she couldn't get away. If I was her, I'd try to get out of the woods. -I'll send Rex after her. -Come on, Mr. Danville. You're crazy! Let me go. Look! She's getting the hell away. -Are you okay Maurois? -Yeah, I'm fine. I've seen worse in Indochina. Come on. It looks like a hunting party. If she's in there, we must make her get out of it. And then? Wait! Sir, wait! Wait! Sir, wait! Wait! Don't try to escape anymore, Miss. Believe me, it won't take you anywhere. I promise we won't do you any harm. Albert, give me your gun. You'll get nowhere with it. Okay. You don't say anything about what happened to you, -and we, on our side... -Don't come any closer. And we don't say a word about my brother, we'll say it was an accident. You won't get involved. Somebody could come on this road, Captain. She knows it. She is stalling for time. Come on, say yes and everything will be over. I don't believe you. You see? No way, Albert. Go, Philippe. -Albert, let Mansart go! -What difference will it make? Let him, I'm telling you! Let's not stay on this road. They won't come. What are you saying, Paul? The cops and the ambulance, they won't come. Nobody went to get them. What are you talking about? Of course they did. Something must have delayed them. I don't know what. And it's Sunday. But the others... With that woman, I'm surprised that they're still not here. They're after her because she ran away. Hush. Don't talk, you're getting tired. She wouldn't listen to Albert or the others, I know. No one will come. No one will come. No one. Not until they have caught the girl. Aren't you feeling well? It's OK. I'm fine, I'm just a bit cold. I'm going to give you the little heater. -Wait for me. -We can't, we lost sight of them. We must warn Rollin, he must be wondering what's going on. And Chamond? Chamond too must be panicking. Especially him. It seems you have forgotten about your brother. Shut up, will you? -Wait for me. -Hurry up, David. Listen, Maurois is going to go. So you're going to tell Rollin the truth. There's nothing else to do, the guy wouldn't understand. He mustn't do a thing, he must wait for us. I'll explain everything to him. Go now. Give me Rex. And hurry. Don't look at me that way. You have nothing to fear from me. What about the others? Wait for me for God's sake. I'm having trouble walking. Hurry up. If Mansart hasn't caught her, she must be far away. She might be at the police station. That wasn't funny. It would be even less funny if Mansart was playing another game with the girl. He knows her, right? One thing he knows even better is his own interest. At the tunnel, no one knew what had happened. Danville didn't want to kill you. Just to scare you, at the most. He'll shoot again if he finds me. -They're here? -No, it's Chamond. What are you going to do? Wait for him to go away. And then? -What the hell are you doing here? -I've been looking for you everywhere. I didn't know what to do. -You didn't warn anyone, did you? -Huh? Don't worry, they know. No, no one. So, what's going on, where is the girl? -You didn't see her? -Well, no. It can't be. They must be hiding somewhere. But... -There was no smoke earlier. -Huh? Over there. I'm in the same mess as the others. There is nothing I can do. Except try to silence me, right? Are they here? Let me go. They'll catch you. You will go out when I tell you to. She's here, isn't she? -Can't you hear me? -I can. So, is she in there? She is here, yes. Is it fixed? Answer, Philippe, did she agree? No. -Stay here, Albert. -Are you going crazy, Philippe? Maybe. Come on now, you can get out. You're such a bastard, Mansart. Do you realize what's going on? You're on the road to ruin. She's ruined us all a while ago. Nimier! You're not going to shoot me, are you? Or any one of us? It's not easy to shoot your friends, you know. It's touching to see you play the hero but you'll regret it. No. We'd better try to stop her on the path to the ponds. Is it my rabbit that you want, Maurois? Don't be a smartass. I got busted again by my boss because of your traps. You do your job well, though. Are you making fun of me? You want to know something? Bosses are all bastards. Leave me the hell alone. What is with you today? You seem weird. Weird, me? Why would I be weird? -Tell me! - I don't know... You're not yelling at me, you're not sticking your rifle on my stomach... Why did you leave the hunt? What hunt? The one of your boss and his friends. What did you see? Nothing, they're hunting, that's all. A boar. A big one. They've been after it since this morning. That's what you wanted to know? Oh, I don't give a damn, I don't like pigs. Well, lucky you're not also interested by pigs. -So, do you want my rabbit? -Stick it up your ass. -She's been there. -Come on, doggy! You see, Nimier, I don't always understand you. That doesn't matter. Why are you with me on this, for example? With you? Well, yeah, in this thing if you prefer. I've got enough on the others to pressure them if they mess with me and they know it. But you have nothing to worry about. You don't want to tell me? -You wouldn't understand. -Try me. It's something I learned in the army. You can't be part of something and not part of it at the same time. A group is a group. I don't see what it has to do with us. Cause you're a dick, Danville. Come on, get it, get it. It's not me I swear, I didn't tell anyone. I hope it's not Rollin. No, they're going towards Fonviére, it's not for us. If they don't catch her in the woods she should get out by the ponds. Go on, I'll catch up. What are you trying to do, David? Can't you tell that I'm in pain? You wouldn't mind letting us go on our own. I don't understand. What are you doing? I am making you go all the way. What are you doing, Paul? You're crazy. I'm thirsty. You mustn't drink. Especially not this. Ouch! You're hurting me. You shouldn't have moved. Stay still now. I think I'm dying, Rollin. You've lost a lot of blood, you're weakened. Listen, Paul, I really have to go and see what's going on. Don't leave me. -You can't stay like this any longer. -Not now. All right, then. I'll stay. I'll stay. Don't fall asleep, Paul. You'll catch a cold. In 1943... I was in the maquis and one day, we got asked to arrest a woman who had told on our friends to the militia. Three of us went... and... when she saw us coming, she ran off. She wasn't that young but still... she made us run all day long, we couldn't get hold of her. Finally, in the evening... we managed to surround her on a little path. She was there, totally exhausted, weary, with no strength left. She had done what she thought she had to do. When she spoke, it was to ask us to finish her off. And then... The three of us shot her. One bullet each, together. Together. It was important. Because that's the hardest part. Wake up, Paul. Paul! Don't sleep. Because of the cold... I followed them because they made me do it. I didn't want to. Why don't we go tell the cops now? Both of us, we'd get away with it. So you think we can get away with it, as you say? I don't. Forget it, Maurois. Yes, Mr. Rollin. I didn't mean it. Let's try to find them and quick. They found her. You don't seem to be happy about it. That's what you wanted, isn't it? Chamond, behind you! -What the hell did you do? - I didn't want to, I swear. Chamond, are you completely mad? I didn't kill her. It can't be. Not me. We must not let her escape. I shot her. Who shot? Answer for God's sake. David! -What's going on? -David, come quick! What is it, Rollin? Paul is dead. How could you let something like this happen? It's insane. And you, Philippe? Where is she now? She ran off to the ponds. She's wounded, I shot her but I didn't mean to. Now it's too late. Don't let me down now. She mustn't run away. -Otherwise I'm done, I can't... -Okay, shut up, Chamond. Come, Albert. Come. God help them find her. Maurois, we're going to the other bank. I can't walk anymore, Philippe. It hurts too much. I'll carry you if I have to, David. Rollin is accepting this situation quite easily. He didn't have a choice. The Danvilles did him a favor once. Yes, an accident, in the mist. There was a cyclist on the side of the road, and we didn't see him. Wait a minute. You ran off? You killed that cyclist, didn't you? Rollin was driving, he was drunk. Help me get out of here. And the Danvilles? There were traces on the car. They made them disappear. I 'd like to see you die here, David. Wait. Wait! Albert! It's her purse. I'll make her come out. I would never have thought a chick could do this. That's horrible. Not like that. Are you mad? Leave me alone, Albert. You want to die too? Is that what you want? Finish her off, at least. You wish I would have done it, huh? We're killing her as one man. Don't forget we must all say the same thing. Paul was alone. He went after a wounded beast. We don't know how it happened but we can imagine. He must have slipped, he fell, it's a common accident. As it often happens. We looked for him for hours, and when we found him, around four... four o'clock. He was dead. Right. Philippe, you know what you have to say. You dropped this woman off at La Guetiére, when you came back here this morning, you didn't see her again, you didn't tell us about her. None of us saw this woman today. We know nothing about her. What if they find her body? I won't allow anyone to empty the ponds or to scrub them for years. Maurois will make sure to lock the gates. And remember one thing, everything we say... is highly believable. We're not the kind of people who can be easily suspected.
