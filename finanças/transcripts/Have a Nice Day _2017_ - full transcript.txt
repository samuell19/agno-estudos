What the...? What's going on? Xiao Zhang, what are you doing? Xiao Zhang, don't be stupid. Think again. You can't touch it. It's Uncle Liu's money... A De, your photography skills are top notch! Yuanjun, in this picture you look much younger than your age. A De, you know what? Yuanjun and I have known each other since we were in diapers. His home is only a 10 minutes' walk from mine. Yuanjun, do you remember? One year the winter was so cold that the icicles on the roof reached the ground. The night you slept over at our house cramped in my bed. I woke up in the middle of the night, wondering why my butt was so cold. In a daze, I opened my eyes to see that our Yuanjun had wet the bed. Made a map with his urine. Later my mother said that Yuanjun had made a map of Taiwan. How patriotic! The blankets and mattress were all wet. We couldn't go back to sleep and ended up huddled at the head of the bed chatting until dawn. What did we talk about? Yuanjun, do you remember? To this fucking day, I still can't forget. You said your Dad took you to Shanghai and you ate the best meat bun you had ever had in your life. You ate 12 at once! 12 meat buns! I immediately started bugging my dad to take me to Shanghai. I wanted to eat 12 meat buns on the Bund too. But my dad slapped me so hard that I saw stars. Lao Zhao. Hello, Xiao Zhang's gone nuts. He took the goods. What? Xiao Zhang? Where are you now? I seem to be in the development zone. Boss, should we call the police? Call the police? You are out of your mind. Listen, come back first and we'll talk. OK, got it, boss. Uncle Liu. Rare or cooked? Understood. Railway Business Hotel Register. Hello, brother Skinny. What's the matter? Old 3, track this number for me. Immediately. Sure, brother Skinny. Also get me some medicine. When do you need it? OK, meet you in 30 minutes at the shop. Hey boss, a real wild turtle. We dug it up on the construction site. I need to rush home soon. How about a real bargain for you? 500 RMB? It's wild. It works better than Viagra. 450? Eat it yourself or set it free for karma, as you wish. So? What about 200? OK? Is it easy to come across a counterfeit bill? This young man looks honest. Give him the change. Integrity Internet Cafe Membership card? It's 2 RMB per hour. Are you there? Yan Zi? I have good news! We can get you more plastic surgery! Let's go to South Korea! Skinny. The car was found. The direction to Qiaobei New Village? OK. A De, you have quite a bit of artistic talent, don't you? I see, this is Fauvism. Many great painters paint in this crazy style. Did I get it right, Yuanjun? You taught me about it before. You also told me that this world is a world of madmen and fools. Madmen stop at nothing, snatching fame and money, and the fools are happy with what they have. So tell me. Are you a madman or a fool? Or a madman pretending to be a fool? Well, to be honest, we grew up together and were once like brothers, young and innocent. It's so sad to see ourselves in this situation today! He says his paintings are now very valuable. Let him go, and they are all yours. Fuck! Fang Yuanjun. You really think your paintings are worth anything? Three fucking years ago, you were still a broke-ass bum. Who bought your first painting? Who rented this studio for you? And who the fuck kept on raising the placards at auctions to raise the price of your bids? Me, fucking Uncle Liu. I'm the one who honored our friendship and supported you. And I did it for pleasure! To be happy. Fuck. Money? You actually want to talk money with me? Fugui, Uncle Liu. I'm sincerely sorry. Please, for the sake of our brotherly friendship, let me go... Fuck off, there is no such thing as brotherly friendship! You and I were already different twenty years ago. A De, if your brother slept with your woman, what would you do? Stab him. What's your Zodiac sign? Capricorn. The plum blossom's fragrance comes from the bitter cold. Good honing gives a sharp edge to a sword. Shit, this kid is quite ambitious. Got it. That's an uncommon screen name. What? Shit, Platypus. IP address located. 10 minutes ago, he logged in from the college town. The college town? Wait, registered address. Should be the Integrity Internet Cafe. Xuehai Road No. 19. Boss, boss? We found the car at an intersection, east side of the city. He left the car keys. Go get the car right now. OK, got it, boss. - We've located Xiao Zhang. - Where? In the college town north of the city. Why are you bringing him? This kid looks so unassuming, but he's carrying a lot of money. So he is definitely, absolutely, worth bringing! Yellow Eye, the binoculars you invented are really useful! Fuck! What binoculars? What? They are not binoculars? I'm wearing a pair of super VR infrared, invincible X-Ray glasses. OK, go ahead and brag. Anyway, I'm holding a big bag of money and it sure feels wholesome! Now we've made our first pot of gold. What's the next step? Next step? What do you mean? A startup! What startup? To start what? Oh, a life without dreams is pathetic! Come on, why is it pathetic? What are you saying? Can you speak like a human being? I have loved inventing and creating ever since I was little, but my family was so poor that I couldn't even go to high school. Fortunately, I was fearless. And I've never forgotten my dream of becoming an inventor. Today God opened his eyes and sent an automatic package of startup capital. I need to plan carefully what to do with my life. All right. Why not spend the rest of your life inventing money? Are you willing to marry me now? Let me just say, I'm definitely not a gold digger! So, can your super binoculars see through clothes too? You bastard! Could you see through Xiao Li's clothes in my shop? Give them to me. I want to see too! Stop this hooligan! But I wasn't speeding! Tough luck! How much soup do I have to sell to make back the 200 bucks? - Shit, the money was exposed! - Oh no! Let's get out of here. What are you doing? Come here. Yellow Eye, Yellow Eye. You're late. There was a situation. Lao Zhao lost the goods. Amitabha Buddha. I've already arranged it. The goods will be found before dawn. Don't worry, Brother Biao! Mom, I told you not to call. What? Don't worry, the Star of Wisdom is watching out for our Le Le this year. Destined to go to Peking U, Tsinghua U, Harvard, Yale, Oxford, or Cambridge. Yes, I know. Just bring the ID card for the consecration ceremony. It'll be fine. OK, yes. Yes, I know. All set, brother Skinny. Take these pigs' kidneys and make soup for your wife. Nourish her so she can give you a chubby baby boy. Thanks, brother Skinny. I'm off. Membership card? I'm just passing through. Without it, there's a 3 hour minimum at 2 RMB per hour. How many hours? The night package is 20 RMB. Pay first. Room 301 Railway Business Hotel My Dad said South Korea isn't 100% safe. It was on the news yesterday. Still there? My Mom said surgeries in South Korea cost half a million. I have 1 million. I'm in room 301 at the Railway Business Hotel. No kidding, they are imported! These speakers are killer! The bass feels like a fist punching my chest. My boss smuggled them in for a nouveau riche. He loves collecting motorcycles. He has dozens of them. When are you going to get one and take me around the world? That again. What again? I may as well give up hope! Remember that time we went to the temple hear our fortunes? Which time? What was it called? The Oracular Spectacular Temple. I was told I'd be strong and wealthy. But I'd face hardship before turning 28, as a test from the heavens. Overcoming the adversity, I'd find glory and prosperity. Cut it out. Glory and prosperity! You actually believe in that nonsense? Look, you're just a good-for-nothing pool table manager who will sacrifice his personal life for his boss at any time. Be thankful you make enough to feed yourself. Stop daydreaming. You'd better come back down to earth. Hello? Hello, Auntie? Ann Ann, I need to trouble you with something. It's no trouble. Speak slowly. What's the matter? Last month Yan Zi went to get plastic surgery. Oh, she went after all? Yan Zi is always so trendy. How did it go? She must be stunning! The results weren't particularly great. Now she hides at home all day and is afraid to go out. But her boyfriend, Xiao Zhang, wants to take her to South Korea for another operation. That's good news. Koreans are good at this. I heard there are tons of plastic surgery clinics there. Xiao Zhang said he has one million RMB at a hotel by the train station. He asked Yan Zi to meet him there. What one million? No idea. I worry Xiao Zhang might have done something stupid. They're getting married at the end of the year. If he gets into trouble, what'll happen to Yan Zi? What could he possibly get himself into? I've never seen a more honest person. Let me talk to Yan Zi. Yan Zi's face is so swollen that she can't speak. But you're pretty close to the train station, right? Can you help your Auntie and see what's going on with Xiao Zhang? Auntie, don't worry. I'm sure Xiao Zhang is fine. Don't worry. I'll come see you and Yan Zi soon. Bye. What's the matter? Clowns. Who has one million? Someone as money-crazed as you are. Her precious daughter's boyfriend has one million RMB. That little guy? One million? Oh no, my boss just told me a client was robbed one million RMB. Is her boyfriend a driver on a construction site? Yup. Oh fuck! My boss said the robber was a site driver. What? I found this room key outside the door. Is it from your hotel? Happy Birthday! One year older! What's there to be happy about? It was a luxurious mess, your birthday party! Nah, the boss is my uncle. Shit! You are a rich kid with deep pockets. If I were a rich kid, I would have gone to college in the U.K. England has left Europe, so what's the point? What's the point of studying anyway? It's Harvard dropouts like Gates and Zuckerberg who make big money. Gates and Zucker! Let's not talk about them. Let's drop out of school and start our own business. Start what business? Something useful in today's society. But that will follow future trends of industry development. Such as? Such as opening a restaurant. What? Think about it, opening a restaurant is great. People always need to eat. If we find a place with feng shui, business can't be bad. Everyday we'd have incoming cash flow. We'll be tired of counting money. Isn't there a difference between creating a startup and making money? This is my seat. I have the 1 million. I'm in room 301 at the Railway Business Hotel. Shall we go back to that place with the fish soup? Oh yeah, the boss with big boobs can sure drink a lot! We'll finish it on the spot? What do you think? Brother Lidu, let's take the money and go to Shangri-La, OK? I've heard the air is fresh, like spring year-round. We can grow vegetables and raise pigs. Shangri-La? I'm going to Shangri-La To see sheep run all over the mountains I'm going to Shangri-La To watch the rainbow hang over the edge of the sky I'm going to Shangri-La To get rid of my city clothes I'm going to Shangri-La To rush up the snowy mountain pagodas Get drunk on the melting glacier water Shoot through the sky to chase the bright moon and stars Let the flames of heaven burn me Run across the wild land to embrace the radiant light What do you say? Let's go to Shangri-La. Xiao Zhang, it's cousin Ann Ann. Yan Zi sent me here to talk to you. Xiao Zhang, are you there? In my eyes, you two are a match made in heaven. I can't wait to drink wine at your wedding. Who are you? Who are you? I'm just passing through. - Finish him now! - I'll kill you! I'm not interested in property investment. Thank you. I'm not interested. Please, don't kill me. I know nothing. Nothing. Don't be afraid. Look over here. You need to pay for the computer. Hello, Mr. Platypus. Who are you? Where's the money? Money? I should be asking you! Did you steal my money? Give it back! Where's the money? One last time, where is it? Tell me who you are first! I'm just passing through. Don't worry about that. Are you a professional hit man, like in the movies? What do you mean? I admire people like you. I've watched The Godfather many times. They are all real men. My dream is to become like you guys! I was always bullied growing up. I'm a chicken. But you dare to rob? My girlfriend had plastic surgery, but it failed. She said her face, her face... I want to take her to South Korea to get it fixed. We're getting married. You shouldn't take Uncle Liu's money. I can't disappoint my mom who wants me to get married and have a child. She went through so much raising me. I must get married soon. That's so touching. Such a devoted son! You are lucky to run into me today. I happen to know a cosmetic surgery expert. How about this, you give me back Uncle Liu's money and you'll meet the expert. For real? I can even get you 50% off. You promise? I promise. But... I really don't know where the money went. I fell asleep at the internet café, and I woke up alone in the van, the money and the bag were gone. For real? For real. You promise? I promise. What a weirdo. Goodbye! Hello? Is this Master Skinny? - Who is this? - A friend. I need your help recovering some money. This is what happened... I'm really busy right now. Call me back later. I'll be quick, Master Skinny... This is what happened... I don't have time right now! Master Skinny, are you listening? It's very simple, so long as no one dies. But if he dies, I'll take responsibility. Help me break his arms. I'll pay you 100,000. please consider it. What a splendid nightscape! Five years ago, this was all one piece of land for corps. Is the tallest one the Vegetable Building? Yeah, I can still see it with my eyes closed. It took them 3 years to build. Three years sounds long. Actually, it's not short. Brother Biao seems a bit sentimental today. Once this land is finished, I'll quit. Brother Biao is kidding. If Brother Biao quits, none of us will be able to eat. Skinny. - We found him. - And the goods? No goods. He said he lost them. Lost them? Uncle Liu, I might need you to take a trip over here. What happened? I'm ashamed to say that I'm injured. Second Sister? What a surprise. Come on in. Li Er isn't home? Still at the site. The past two days have been busy. Construction? He's not driving taxis anymore? With a hernia, he can't drive anymore. He's now a security guard at a construction site. He does a few fares on occasion. Security doesn't pay much, but at least he's not in pain. We have a child to think about. Cuifang, this is for you. Use it as you wish. Sister, what is this? When will Li Er be back? I was going to ask him to drive me into town. Why go into town so late? It's urgent, but no worries if he's not around. I'll give him a ring. He's not answering. Let's go to the site and find him. You went to Lao Zhang's place to play cards yesterday? Hell no! You won't believe it. He dragged me to that church to hear a sermon. A sermon? Since when do you believe in that stuff? Like hell I do! I just went to kill some time. Hey, I've been thinking about something lately. Between God and Buddha, who do you think is more powerful? God and Buddha? Yeah, which one of the two is more powerful? This question is a bit deep. I'll believe in whoever is more powerful. You're asking the right guy. Let me tell you. Whether it's God, Buddha, the Jade Emperor or Guanyin Goddess, they are all almighty! Simply put, they are all big bosses. Big bosses? Yes, all of them are big bosses. Believe in whomever you want. That's the truth. People need to live a spiritual life. Think deeply about things, and act wisely in His deeds. By the way, how's your new job? What's there to say about being a security guard? It's not bad, just not much freedom. Freedom? You know what freedom really is? Isn't it being able to do whatever you want with no one bothering you? Everybody loves freedom. Let me tell you what real freedom is about. Listen up and try to remember this. Real freedom has three levels. The first level is the farmers' market freedom. Farmers' market freedom? When you go to the farmers' market in the morning, you don't need to consider the price or what's in season, and you buy whatever you want. If you want to eat beef, buy beef. If you want to eat roast duck, buy roast duck. This is farmers' market freedom. I want to eat abalone. The second level is supermarket freedom. You go to the supermarket. Same deal: no need to think about price. Forget about discounts, you simply buy what you like. Push the cart down the aisle and get whatever you want. This is supermarket freedom. The third level is online shopping freedom! My friend, does your wife like to find bargains online? Everyday she's busy clicking to fill her shopping cart? You bet. She's browsing all day long. She must be excited to one day pay for everything in her online shopping cart, overseas purchases, worldwide products. Buying as much as she likes. This is online shopping freedom. Now do you understand freedom? Got it. I don't even have farmers' market freedom yet! It seems Brother Biao really wants to quit this time and head to the temple to become an abstaining Buddhist. Twenty years ago, I was just a homeless kid, laying bricks on a construction site to make a living. Brother Biao took me under his wing. It's tough to see Brother Biao like this today. We all have a beast inside of us. Who said these words? A foreigner, I think. Really? I always thought it was Jack Ma. Jack Ma said that everyone's heart has a dream in it. A De, pull over for a second. We all have dreams. Didn't Steve Jobs say that? I think Jobs said "follow your heart". Really? A De. What is your heart telling you to do now? To beat up the lunatic who just passed us. Let's leave our great painter in peace for now. What do you want? Do you know how much this car is worth? How dare you hit me! Do you know who I am? Ah, that high of a rebate is definitely fishy. You shouldn't buy. The hell with the P2P business model! A bunch of crooks! Don't buy anything before I get home. Brother Zhao. Cuifang? What brings you here? I need to talk to Li Er. This is my second sister. Oh, nice to meet you, second sister. You guys talk. I'll go find Li Er. Where did you strike your fortune? What fortune? I run a small business that barely pays the bills. That's better than working on construction sites. No way, you guys are doing big business here. Your husband is a big boss, right? We're divorced. Oh, that's better. Peace and freedom. I'm pissed. Li Er isn't here. I bet he's out drinking again. Forget it, Cuifang. Let's go back. Can I help? My sister needs to get to the city and wanted a ride from Li Er. Oh, in that case, I was just about to go back to the city. Ride with me. What's so important that you have to get to the city so late? Nothing too important. Your boyfriend? What? Boyfriend, girlfriend... Brother Zhao knows how to joke around. You can put your bag on the back seat so you're more comfortable. No worries. I'm fine. Why are you holding onto it so tightly? It's nothing. Just clothes. Oh no, I left my ID card at my sister's place. Brother Zhao, I'm sorry, but we need to get it. It's about to pour, forget it. I can't. I need it tomorrow. Let me out. I'll go back myself. Cut it out! How the fuck do you know Xiao Zhang? Stop lying. The bag is full of money, isn't it? It's my money! Stop the car! Ah? Fourth uncle? Is there someone staying here tonight with a black bag? We only have one guest tonight. In 301. Uncle Liu, is that you? Uncle Liu? What happened, fourth uncle? Nothing. What's going on today? Everything is fucked up! Skinny has never messed up before. I heard that Skinny is from a martial arts family. Yes, his ancestors were all armed escorts. He learned it on the streets. Unlike your generation that's learned everything in martial arts academies. He wouldn't have to be a butcher if he had gotten a good education. Although he's good at what he does, I always felt that sooner or later something would happen to him. - Why? - Because of his personality. Skinny is a proud man. He thinks too highly of himself. You think it's necessary for someone like him to send his daughter to study in America? Hundreds of thousands a year! Maybe he wanted to change his fate. But most people end up changed by fate. There's an accident. Go have a look. Uncle Liu! It's Lao Zhao! What? The money's with Lao Zhao. Without technology, we just can't win.
