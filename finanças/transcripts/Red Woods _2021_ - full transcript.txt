Hey guys... Guys! Guys, hold up hold up! Guys... I spy something abandoned... Ahhh, Do you see it? Who sees it?? Check it out!! YES!!! It's AWESOME! We found the mother lode!! It's so creepy. The coolest house! Wow. Whoa... Hey Adam are you getting this? Oh yeah! I can not wait to check out this baby! Just so you guys know... I'm not going in first. You never do Phil! Yeah, most houses I shoot- like-they're not scary until I go inside... this one's scary from a mile away! Yeah I know- she's the mother of all abandoned houses! Aw man, my brother's gonna shit when he sees this! You hear that Cross, bro... You gonna shit! It's gonna take us like a day and a half- to get down there. Alright zooming back in... I'm calling it... the DEMON HOUSE. Map says there's an old house just below... We should film that one first. Hey Phil, you shooting film? Uh-no. It's CAPTURING! CAPTURING, not FILMING... Capturing. That sounds stupid. Aw come on! Well-whatever we're gonna do we gotta do it soon... Go! Go! Go! Go! To the house!!! Just go!!!! Oh my God... He fucking killed them! I'm not going in there! Where else we gonna go?? I mean... We need to find something... Fuck, my light's fried- ...A shovel, hammer-ANYTHING. It's not gonna take him long to figure out we're in here! Where are you going??? Shh quiet! Nothing... There's gotta be SOMETHING... Fuck me. Oh Jesus! What are you doing!? Turn off the fucking camera! Please Dee Dee- Just stay behind me! What the hell... What is all this? Let's- Let's try upstairs... Oh my God! Stay behind me! I think someone's up there! Adam... Shut up! What... D-d-di... did you see that? No... Don't come over here. Dee Dee? How many times you gonna watch that dude? As many damn times until it starts making sense. Damn this zoom is NICE. Where the hell's the white balance on this thing? Testing out your new gear? Uh huh. Your bro's always pulling that drama shit- a creepy abandoned house is never enough without adding his own... whatever. I know. If Adam finds a house that ISN'T haunted- It will be by the time he's done with it. Mm-hmm. There's no cell-service in these woods- How the hell does he upload this? Well, let's ask him when we get there- We'll leave around eight, yeah? You think all those jokers in our group will show? After seeing this? Who knows... Looks like Adam's group showed up though. This looks like NEO FUEGO to me. But it's posted on Adam's channel- Not on that horror-happy nutjob's. What? Hey get this- from Adam... "You still coming up tomorrow bro?" If everything's fine- then why isn't he responding to my texts then? 'D you call him a dumbass again? That could be why. Dutch, put down the camera already- This place isn't abandoned yet. Yeah, not till next week- when you marry my sister. Then it will be, a-hole! I can't seem to figure out- where the hell the house is... The one from the video. Hmm Abandoned houses- creepy cemeteries- we shoot it all! Weddings too! AND funerals... one more day. I'll be home by Saturday. Yeah but you're gonna miss the entire trip- and I'm gonna miss you. Oh I had to get this! The guy's given up on humanity- But somehow my sister broke through his impenetrable shell. Hi Kat! Niiice. Smooth. Oop! Looked into the camera. My bad. Anytime I'm shooting an abandoned house- I always tell the ghosts: Never look into the camera. Just act natural. Dutched at the end. You're WAY too paranoid honey. No, really, they're listening in to this very conversation as we speak! I don't think you're an enemy of the state, Cross! To THIS state... I am THE enemy! Dude, give it a rest already! Hey you got you work cut out for you with this guy, sis. My boy's coming prepared! Cross's camera- Cross's batteries- Cross's memory cards- Cross's underwear- Cross's... ammo... Uh, hey I'm not sure you heard, but, we're shooting video up there-not firearms. If you think I'm going into those woods armed with only my camera... Ohh - that's... very comforting. We ready bro? I think so. Locked and loaded! Let's do this! Chickety-check, check, check- one, two, three- audio level on manual. Dutch, you're gonna kill your battery before we even get there. I have five days of battery... We're only gonna be up 'ere for three days, so by my calculations... I'll be okay. Yeah, Raven, and Berzener said he'd make it. And it's not like we're gonna recognize these guys, I mean... You haven't seen any of 'em, right? No... Except Madhouse 'cause he shoots himself half the time. Hmm. Tell me Neo Fuego isn't gonna show. I didn't invite him. Redstone County! Home of the Redstone County Woods a.k.a. the Red Woods- Dead ahead! Wow, Look at this place. We now accept credit and debit... Slip into the twenty-first century- nice. The end of civilization as we know it... And use that term generously. Ahh, look who's coming. Brain food? Yep, to help mine develop even more and you to start to grow one in the first place. Ha ha ha that is so clever! That's good one. Cross, what are you doin'? We're like an hour late... We can't do... Dude, c'mon! Awww. Be right back. Yeah thanks. Hey. Hey. ...helpin' out your new best friend so now we're gonna be more than an hour late. I sent 'em all a text, but... If they're already up there, forget about it! Big whoop! So they'll have to wait. That guy was totally messing with us about those woods, man. How do you know? Maybe his buddy never made it out, like he said. Not THAT hard to believe. Okay now I'm fuckin' nervous. I'm nervous now... and a nervous cameraman is a worthless... Are you sure we're not lost? Who says I'm not TRYING to get lost? Maybe... I'm just trying to get rid of somebody really annoying. Hmm I wonder what that could be? ...the abandoned farmhouse in New Castle my video has almost ten thousand views! Nice. "One way in", there it is! Wow. We made it! Mouth of the mighty Red Woods of Appalachia. Uh here-keep her slow and steady... Woohoo! We made it! YEAH!!!!! MAN, these be some SERIOUS woods. If this place is as isolated as they say, I may come live up here. Yeah, I'm sure NSA would never find you up here, you paranoid maniac. Are you kidding... Do you even realize what you're doing to yourself? Yes. Yeah maybe you're right. The Feds are probably up here just waiting for us. Don't laugh, jagoff. You much be Dutch. How'd you guess? You must be Madhouse. Hi guys! Hi. This here's Crosshairs. Cross. Hey. Crosshairs... Always on target! I'm Raven. Hi. You're much prettier than the guy we thought you were gonna be! This is my best friend Jack. Hi. Hi! This is awesome, it's like a... a reunion between old friends- who've never actually met before. That two-story with the stone staircase you shot last month was incredible. Thanks man! Uh-actually... I fell down one of 'em chasing a ghost, and I got a bruise here to prove it. Oh dude nice! Check this out... It's a scar from a nail last month. Awesome! â™ª Farewell and adieu you fair spanish ladies... You guys' Detroit project last year was AMAZING! I cried. Seriously. I'm still crying. Was that old cemetery you shot next to that foundation for real? The one from a few months back? Yeah, oh my God yeah. Jack and I were there for hours. I was shooting video and she was convincing the spirits to leave us alone. True... many there are not at rest and certainly not in peace. Oh-Jack is empathic... like a spiritual energy healer. She's not one to blow her own horn, but she's one of the only people in the tri-state who can do what she does! Let's hike for a little while before we scare everybody away! Aw man! Does this mean we have to be careful what we THINK? No. Guys... guys check it out! Nice! Aerial photography! Awesome! Nice. Check this baby out! Yeah. You guys like that, huh. My name's Ensa. Ensa? Yes. Like Mensa, but without the M. Mensa like the high-IQ club. Ah, but minus the high IQ. I'm Flynn. I'm the one that emailed you Wednesday. Oh yeah right. These two are big fans of our little club... I hope you're cool with them joining the adventure. Yeah! More the merrier! Time to get outta here I think. Madhouse-man! That's not gonna... Ohhh yeah - this is, uh, pretty crazy. Mmm Ms. "not to blow her own horn"'s pretty cute! Dude, she can blow my horn any day of the week and twice on Sunday! It's forty-some square miles of mostly dense forest and moderately rough terrain. We're about four miles in, right... here. from the covered bridge back... here. One way in! From what I've heard, aside from the covered bridge- there's no way in or out of these woods unless you have a kayak or rappelling gear. And so our target structures are: here, here, and this one here, before meeting up with team one here. Team one started on Monday, and circled to hit all the houses to the east and north... at least ten structures. Who knows how many more we couldn't see from satellite view. And so we're on the short-leg route to the east. Damn! Ten houses. I wish I could've got the time off. Yeah, at least some of us still do work for a living. So we meet up on Sunday and then straight back to this spot. But what happens... We should probably get moving - everybody. Whoa... ...I mean if anything happens, we have no way to reach anybody? Oh... my... God... Are you shooting tape??!! I love that! That's so neat! Yep! Standard-def and loving it! You don't have to shoot me, I'm just saying... No you look good on camera. I, I don't like it... That's a good shot. I'm uncomfortable. No? You're staying. Well, I'll film you back, so... No, No- Here we go, wait, Is this what you do? Dutch angle? No no no that's MY thing! Aw no... You've been DUTCHED! That's mine! It's trademark. Stealing it! Alright stop, it's making me very uncomfortable. I don'e like this at all. I'm freaking out! Don't worry- Just relax... nothin's gonna happen. Besides, we've got Cross-bo over there to protect us. Hero shot... ruined! Hope we find some clearings where you can fly that thing. Map shows a few possible areas, even the first location. You know Neo Fuego? Neo Fuego... what's Neo Fuego? He's another urbexer who uses a drone, so I thought you might know him. Oh. He any good? Well... if you consider A nice, smooth aerial shot of a house engulfed in flames while people are trapped inside screaming "good", then... Um... okay.... Yeah, when he shoots the inside of a house it's usually because there's blood on the walls or bodyparts on the f... He posts demented videos with no descriptions and is cross-subscribed with all us urbex dweebs, so... Probably a make up or special effects guy or something... Or a sick bastard. Oh he's definitely... Let's do this!! Five seconds... Oh my! No, go ahead, go ahead. keep going... don't look at the camera, just act natural... same thing I tell all the ghosts... Hey... you guys keeping up? Aw... look at all this mud... ...Ensa. Flynn... and... Madhouse. And of course my BFF! Hi Jax! This is like the, uh, the enchanted forest. un-freaking-believable! You gotta love this... I mean, look at this! This is like picturesque. This is, like... beautiful! Whoa! Check out this tree dude. That looks like the alien! Yeah, whatever you say Dutch. "Ash, can you see this?" It looks like the what? ...Adam, from the first group. He's... who's brother? Cross's Yeah he posted the little horror-show yesterday His last video... GOD! This pack sucks! It must weigh a hundred fuckin' pounds, man! So... whaddya think? Are ya havin' fun? It's beautiful... but There's a lot of sadness... and darkness... Wow. Check this out! I can't wait to go inside. I bet it's SO creepy! Aw, man! Guys! Guys, look at this- do you see that window? Nice. Move over NSA, we've got Ensa! Damn right. Aw man, this thing might fall down! Get outta my shot Cross-bo. Hey Cross-bo! Jees man sorry - Cross. We got plenty here. How far to the next location? Whoa - we haven't even went inside the house yet! Walk in my frame. Hey! Are you done playing with your toy? It's almost like it has a life of its own can you feel it? Feel what? The energy coming from inside the house, it's... It has this heaviness... No. But... while you feel it, I'm gonna tape it. Look at this place! Wow. Look at this... monstrosity Is there any... g-g-g-g-ghosts Scoob?? And the kitchen floor... is... no more. Wow. I wonder how old this house is. Whoa... Get a hero shot. Going to level two. Alright. I'm kinda nervous to come up these steps... Oh my God... Oh shit. Hi Jax. What's up Dutch! Ow - that's kinda bright... Sorry! Jack feeling some stuff out. This room creeps me out man. They left one outfit behind. One pair of shoes... I know! One shirt... I don't like it... There's this shoe here... and this one over here.... A dress outfit too... ...I don't know. It's just... why was someone ripping up books? Yes! This is the very definition of urbex right here. What kind of skull? Are you freaking kidding me? Is that really a skull? Guys, there's a skull over here! Ohh, what are you? This is no time for a bathroom break, Cross. Always hilarious. Are you gettin' in the mirror? I'm getting YOU in the mirror. Me? You done were GOT in the mirror. There you go... pose time! Oh, I'm walking away. I thought I saw something behind you... What was that? Is there anybody up on three? No we're all down here. Did you hear that? Oh God, I hope no one's up here... She heard somethin' up there, I think... Raven? Raven! Careful, man... RAVEN! I'm alright. Sorry if there's a spirit and I'm making you angry. Just lookin' at your house. What do you think happened here? Somebody's neck was broken and I can't figure out how... What?? No cell service out here my ass! Anyone die in here Jax? No... Maybe in there... Aw no... Whoa Jesus! Is that blood? Oh, man! Oh my God... Raven was right... You ARE good. Looks like someone blew their fucking brains out up there. I wanna know how the hell she knew that. So are you like a mind-reader? No, not exactly. Um... Can you tell what I'm thinking right now? Nope. No idea. Hmm, good. She's not THAT good... Got some good shots out here. Inside any good? Oh yeah, Another house rotting in purgatory waiting for us to come along and disturb its nice, even coat of dust. Sure, yeah. I got some good shots! Yeah me too... when we weren't tripping over each other. Yeah I thought that might happen so that's why I sat this one out. Hmm. ...about a mile and a half, maybe. Yeah... Waypoint three? Mile and a half! Goddamn I'm freaking dying here. (RAVEN: [laughs) Suck it up wimp-house! Doesn't the camera body alone go for like six grand? Yeah. Another four for the lens. Sweet. Beats the hell outta mine. You loaded... like rich dude? No, man. This is an 'Uncle Sam' special... courtesy of a few, you know- bogus government grants. Uh... Uhh We should probably all get movin'. ...a little better. I think it's a little more balanced if I actually carry the camera in front. Uh oh... Jack... What? I don't like this... Cross, hold up a second. What is it? I... This can't be good. Can anyone else feel this? Listen... Can you hear her... Hear who? I can hear her. Listen... Well, shit maybe we should get the hell outta here and leave her alone. Uhhh... Jack you're... you're kinda freaking these guys out. I can hear her- she's crying... Ohhhhh man... Om namah shivaya... Om namah sh- Ow!!!! What the hell! Careful. You alright? You good dude? What was that- a stone??? We should go... U-u-ugh Jesus! What?? It's a fuckin' tombstone! Are you serious? Really? Yeah. What are you doing??? We should leave this alone. Matthew F... Feinman Eighteen... eighty four... Eighteen ninety-seven. Damn. Just thirteen. Poor kid. A relic. Kinda creepy. Shh! I hear him... Matt... Matt... Matt, is that you? Oh, you silly sh... Had you all going, didn't I? Stifle it Ensa-go! Uhhh Guys... What are you doing? Dude... Cross, c'mon! What is that? Is that another one? Is that a tombstone?? Oh my God! It's a fucking cemetery!! This is a graveyard! Check this out! There's another one! Oh my God they're everywhere guys... They're all over the place ...is a little unsettling. We should not be here... Guys... Maybe Jack's right... maybe we should go. Kind of an ancient burial ground. Creepy cool! Oh my God a cemetery... No way anybody knows about this! Safe to say, I mean I don't see a fresh bouquet of flowers anywhere. I can't... I CAN'T... You okay Jack? You can't WHAT, Jack? These woods can't be cleared. Cleared? I don't wanna be cleared... Guys Jack is right, we shouldn't be here... Jack, wait! Ummm... It's getting late. What just happened? I wanna get everybody in my shot. Go ahead-go ahead. This is beautiful! Wow. I'd forgotten how much I hate foot-travel! ...he thinks the government is out to get him? FBI, NSA, CIA... Cross thinks the world's spying on him twenty-four/seven. Why? Conspiracy theories, paranoia, wild imagination... It's a tough question... Yeah. Hmm. I don't know, I think about a lot of the, uh... The journalists, you know in war-torn countries and stuff like that, They got a lotta... They gotta document the... Yeah, the battle... the battles, and... Yeah- The atrocities and... They have to take that footage back to their editors and all that, so... It's a good point. There's a lot of evidence, a lot of... things that happen. So would you save the camera or would you save your friend In that situation? I know I'd save the camera. I wouldn't save Cross. I mean, no offense to him, but... I'm just kidding! I'd save Cross, of course. I wouldn't save the camera. Look right here, It looks like a butterfly or a bird even like There's the... like with a long tail. and then wings... with the light coming through the trees... Yyyeah. Okay. The footage is important... Yeah, 'cause that could save millions. I mean, you could be documenting atrocities and you know, human rights violations... Yeah dude... It's a tough one. I... don't know man, I think Cameras are not as heavy as people. They don't complain or bleed all over ya.... Yeah... Nothing you wouldn't have though of in a minute anyway! You know me too well. Hold on... I'm sorry fern. I will put you back in just a minute. Nature selfie! We could just keep going straight. No, there's no way we're gonna hit both locations if we want to camp before dark, so I say we hit 'em both simultaneously and meet up on the northeast side... here. I'm for that. Seven's a damn crowd. Yeah, but not everybody has a map, so if we get lost, we won't be able to find each other. Here... Ensa... You, Flynn and Madhouse hit the southern location... that one. The rest of us will hit the other one. Okay. Alright... Testing... testing. You shouldn't need those anyway. Just head northwest from your location and we'll camp maybe a half-mile out. Jeeees... Man! Nice... Spooky nice! How some of these remain standing is a mystery to me. Gimme the lowdown Jax... Haunted? Demons? Stench of death? I don't know that I'd call it a 'stench'... Well couldn't you just wave your wand and make all the bad stuff go away before we go in? I'm not goin' in. C'mon Jax... Why not? I'm just not. Wow... look at this. Man! Whew... Definitely smells like somethin'... Hmm. Nice and moldy. Is that the basement?? ...You're the tough guy, not me I'm your sidekick... You're Batman, I'm Robin. I'm just here to... follow you around. Alright, getting outta here. They left me by myself... Kinda creepy. Kiiinda creepy. ...foot drop. I will not ne exploring that today. My buddy Cross... Yeah, it smells moldy... Oh - maybe that's why. Do ya... Do ya think that's why? 'Cause there's a big hole in the ceiling? That would probably do it. ...It's like the Star Wars, that... garbage chute or whatever. I'm pretty nervous to walk in here actually... 'cause I know the floor looks like it's gonna go... Oh my God! You okay? You're through. Dutch MOVE! Guys HELP! Do somethin'! Check THIS out... Aw, man! Wow. What the fuck... Whoa! What the hell happened here??? Are you sure this is the place? Yeah, well... it was. Okay... Yeah, waypoint four. Waypoint what? Jesus! It looks like a... like a... bomb was dropped or something. Whoa what is that thing? Fine... Keep your little secrets. Designate amber three... Mm hmm... See if I save YOU guys before I save my camera. Ummmm... Hey do you guys- do you guys feel that? Hmm? Holy shit - it's still hot! Yeah, this like... JUST happened. Re-designate.. Uuugh... what... what is that? Do you guys smell that? Oh my God!!! What? Oooh my God. Oh God! Oh shit... Oh my God... Re-designate... ...It hurts... You don't mind if I interview you right now? You okay? Yeah. I'm good. It doesn't look like there's any gaping wound... It burns a little Does it? But I'm good. I'm good. You go ahead and get that thing cleaned up. Rave... c'mon! Rave, I got all that on film. You got it on tape? I did! I didn't stop rolling 'cause they were, like this they were here helping you. Thanks-you got my camera! That was a little scary though I gotta be honest. Don't do that again, it's... Well you told me not to go in there... I DID tell you not to go in there, but it's... As soon as I went in there, too. Nope! I'm ready to go back in though. At least disinfect! before you go back in. Well I do't think she should go back in... I'll disinfect, that's it though. Okay thank you. Wait out here with Jax. No, I'm ready, I'm good... Goin' back in. Are you okay? Are you sure? I mean, it's gonna bruise up... are you sure you'll be able to walk fine? That hurts a little bit. Does it sting? A little bit... Aw, I... I can't watch... You comin'? Yeah we're comin'... I'll be fine guys! Alright let's go, let's do it! Alright c'mon. You're a trooper! ...As long as I don't break anything right? Alright... We're good. Alright house two... take two. Oh... bedroom... I think... maybe this is the living room. It's like a fireplace... Ugh... Hey Cross, come here! Whoa... Nice staircase! I see Dutch has his 'dutch'. Uh huh. Hey dude, Give me a slow 'zombie walk' up these stairs. Zombie what? You know... a zombie walk... slow ascent to claim your next victim. C'mon it'll be awesome! Do it! Do it! Yeah! Dumb as hell, but... I wouldn't want to deprive you of your 'awesome'. Thank you. Ahhhooohhh... C'mon Cross, make papa Romero proud! This is aweful! I'm a zom-bie... He said "I'm a zombie!" WHOA!! Cross!!!! Cross!!! You okay??? Cross!!! Are you okay man? Ouch!! Oh God... Aww, you scared us to death up here. Owwww... Hey Cross, Why do we fall? Shut the fuck up! Seriously! Cross are... are you okay?? Yeak I think... I think so... scrapes on my hands... but I landed on something soft. Alright, here I got a flashlight, dude. Hold on... Oh my god!!!!! It's a fucking body!!! SHIT!!! SHIT!!!! Dutch get him outta there!! Um... I'm gonna go get your backpack... I'm gonna- I'll get some rope... I'll be right back!!! Just stay right there!!! Cross, wait up. Cross... Jesus! I haven't seen him this upset since he found out his uncle Joey was on welfare! Is he okay? I don't know how he could be. Oh he's a tough mother. He'll be fine. Jax why don't you go and talk to him... Calm him down. You know what's going on with him. She does? Um, okay... I think a mini-session might- might help him right now. Session?? What's goin' on? Come and find out... It's Adam... You're thinking about your brother. You're worried about him... I th... I thought it was... him in there... his body, but-it wasn't. You fear he's not okay. I don't know... There's something else... Who's the little kid, I'm seeing... a little boy... a little blond boy? Little blond boy! When we were kids we used to live next door to this run-down house- I don't remember anybody ever living in. I mean, boarded up windows... I just never understood why. So Adam and I would sneak in and play... explore it and check it out. It was spooky- We-we were just kids. One night, Adam and I... we were out back playing when we noticed a flickering light coming from one of the unboarded back windows in that house So, we go over and we found this little kid... maybe ten years old, in the house. He'd set fire to it and it was starting to burn pretty good. So Adam and I, we put it out and dad called the police... Found out later the kid was abandoned and had been using the house for months. I just thought... A little abandoned kid... in an abandoned house. You haven't let him go. Cross... You didn't hurt him, you helped him. I don't know. As I have less and less tolerance for real people I find a kindred spirit in many of these houses. Every house has a story... Abandoned- forgotten for decades waiting to be rescued... for the story to be told. Don't give up on us, Cross. You have to find a way to purge the negative and see the light. Him? Purge the negative? That'd be like pouring peroxide on a turd! Cross trauma can bring out one's true nature... Your's is good! You mean there's still hope for this guy? Well hell's bells! Because IF we tell them, they might expect us all to leave. They might freak. I'm still freaked! I agree, let's not say anything. That Ensa's strange enough already. Yeah... right. Well no matter who stays or who goes I'm not leaving these woods without Adam. I'm with you, bro. Thank you. Don't talk about the decaying corpse... Do NOT talk about the decaying corpse... Don't talk about the decaying corpse... Check it out! It's like a thousand year old barn silo! Where's the barn? Hey Cross... "Everywhere I look, SOMEthing reminds me of him..." He's hairy! ...Like they found the corpse's identity on that show- I think it was... CSI Miami. CSI my butthole! CSI uranus? Inter-planetary crime investigators! Was that Cross who just said that? I think you're east of us heading west. No... I think we're north... Uh, hold on... Can you... Hey, give a holler will ya. Sure. YO HOOOOOO!! Hear that? Okay gotcha. Heading your way. HAD to get this! Fifteen minutes and still about the size of a candle. Okay! The wood is wet... You are welcome to give it a shot if you want to! No you're good... Well, well, well- look who's here! We made it! Can you believe it? Hi guys. Who's that? Look who decided to show up: Mister D La Casa himself. Devlin actually. D La Casa, no way! I had no idea you were comin'. Dutch. Oh yeah- you're the... great angler. And um... You miss, you must be... Raven? Yeah. Hey, how's it goin'. You never responded to our trip invites or planning emails... Devlin. My apologies. I was, uh... In the area. Very funny. Hey... my brother has that exact same camera. You guys find anything good at the third house? Awesome house... Creepy! Right Rave? Uh, Yeah. Creepy. Good stuff. Yeah, except when you fell through the floor... and then Cross fell through a staircase. Yo, cool it La Casa man! It's not funny! It's kinda funny... Yeah you know that guy, he's like the king of urbex... Yeah. His channel has like seventy thousand subscribers! Wow. SO not fair. You just... Cook your own hot dog! You just seem like you're better at it... I don't know... They're having a lot of fun at this too. It's very nice. Come on... I'm gonna yarf. I don't wanna eat any more. I'm gonna yarf- In the fire! Okay fine. Who's cleaning up my vomit? I'm just kidding! And then they hear his words. Whatever you do... don't turn around. So he slowly walks the dark path resisting the urge to turn around. Listening... What was that??? If he turns to look- it's certain death! Or is it? So on he walks until he finally can't take it anymore. Whatever you do, DON"T TURN AROUND! He turns to look... He gasps! At the back of the roads end is his girlfriend- hanging dead from a tree! Ohhh! Aw I LOVE it! That wasn't scary. Hey! You said campfire stories, that's the one I know! It's the perfect ending... Hey Madhouse-man, let's hear the story about that fancy camera of yours. This... this is not just any camera, okay this is... high-tech, climate-science data gathering equipment. Oh, Jesus... It's what? Ah-nah, it's uh, it's top secret. See if I told you, then I'd have to sodomize you. Come on, man! Okay okay... My cousin in D.C., his wife works for the EPA and, uh... She says they're giving away BILLIONS alright, not-not millions, but billions in their silly... climate-change initiative or whatever. Oh, global warming- good one! And uh, she hands me some paperwork and she says If I apply for a grant of like, uh ten grand or less, it's a done-deal, no problem. but, you know, I told her... I don't really believe in, uh, climate-change, and global warming and all that. She- She leans in, she puts her arm around me, she goes "neither do we, but we're talkin' BILLIONS." Oh brother. God damnit. fucking fraud! So it's not YOUR camera, It's MY camera... it's OUR camera, the taxpayers' camera. Suckers! Look you should do what I do... I quit paying taxes years ago. You wouldn't believe what Uncle Sam has in his stash and for the taking, I mean, you got the P-A-D-H-S givin' away cash. You got, uh, Eeeeasy big guy. Sit back down, man... ...some good old fashioned disability for good measure. And if you're a minority... whoa buddy! You know what I'm talkin' about, right? No- I actually DON'T. I couldn't do a whole lot better if I was working a shit-job every day, so... Like MY shit-job?? Your momma must be proud. I'm not livin' in her basement and I send her a birthday card every year. I shouldn't have asked... It's fine. Look, it's all legit- I can send you the information... Cross? Well-I believe a debt of thanks is in order... Ohhhh shit... No problem man, happy to help. No! I mean it's time YOU thank ME... for supporting YOU and your pathetic fucking life!! He's got a gun! Uncle Sam's fucking stash?? That comes outta MY paycheck! HIS paycheck- HER paycheck! Cross STOP!!! You're worthless... WORSE than worthless! You're a leech! Put it down man!!! I've been to Detroit asshole- I've seen what happens to a city when it's filled with fucking parasites like you! You like abandoned houses? Try five fucking square miles of them!!! Now I get to watch as my country turns into Detroit... Thanks to people like YOU?? He's gonna shoot him... FUCK THAT!!! Say THANK YOU!! Say it NOW! MADHOUSE Tha- thank you... thank you... Aw man! Oh my God!! Fuck! Holy shit... What just happened? Oh my God... Psychopath. That's assault with deadly. It's not loaded- chamber's empty. That's jail time my friend! I'm sorry, I- I... shouldn't have done that... Is he okay? I have a story. There once was... a little boy- who just wanted to play. He wished he could have his own playground. I want a play-ground- I want a play-ground... ...he'd sing. But the other kids were mean, and... there was... a decade of abuse going from institution to institution. All the while, he'd sing- Where is my play-ground. But see, things had gotten... twisted in his mind. The word "play", had become "hurt"... To inflict pain- To burn. What the fuck??? Years later, he escaped to the remote back woods. Ya know... not far from where we are right now. THIS... would be his playground. This was... Disneyland... upside-down. Who IS this guy? Where - hunters become the game. Where hikers... bleed in pain. A group of explorers on an expedition venture in just a liiiitle too deep... Uh uh. Another group comes. Jax?? They can smell the stench of death. Will they turn back? No! First, one disappears... The next... trapped! Grisly discoveries. Secrets revealed. Turn back!! They try... They drive out... CRASH! They find The tall, dark house. Won't you come in? If there's no one around, and you fall in MY woods... When you scream will you really make a sound? Can we please be done with storytime now? You about ready? No. What do you mean "no"! You'd better go apologize to him, like right now! Okay?? You can't put a gun to someone's head! All those phantom Feds with their satellites... You're gonna give them an actual reason to come and get you! Hey... look at this. What? D La Casa... Devil in the house. Holy shit... Devlin? Where is he? Is he still out there? Um- he was by Ensa's tent. No no no no, see, this is what I'm talkin' about dude! You c... Devlin... Devlin, where are you? Devlin? What the hell?? Pipe down guys! Shhh! Quiet! What? You alright man? He was here like ten minutes ago. We just found out that Devlin was with Adam and the first group! Oh shit! Are you serious? I don't believe this! God damnit!!! Ugh... I feel sick... Raven!!!!! What the f... Rave, where are you??? What?? What's goin' on? RAVE! Have you seen her? No. What- she left her tent? Yeah... RAVE!!! Have you seen her???? Why would she leave her tent? Aw man... She wasn't feeling well. I think she got up like three or four times in the middle of the night. She went-that way... and, like once to vomit, I don't know!!! Jesus! Don't worry. Oh my God... We'll find her! RAVEN! Say something! Are you out there??? Raven! Rave!! No... Raven!! Raven!! This is fucked. Maybe she got scared and ran off. The way you've been acting... I can almost buy that. This is so fucked up! ...I know but I'm just saying she wouldn't just leave. RAVEN!! Raven!! This is crazy! Raven!! Raven! Guys come here! What? What is it? That guy left his camera. Wait-where was that at? It was right here... where he was hangin' out last night. Battery's dead... Guys! Jesus God no... What?? It's your brother's memory card! Aw, man- That's his camera! Oh my god... ...We can't stay here. Our best chance of finding her is to keep moving. Okay Jax? Come on, let's go. Okay... There's clips on here dated yesterday. Hmm. That the card from your brother's camera? One of 'em. Where the hell's clip one? Ahhh, man... Yes! Oh no... Holy shit! Oh... my... God. Not good. Not good. What the fuck? Cross, man... He was on us from the beginning... What... what the hell? He was there... We didn't find him, he found us. This is... scary. Really scary. He's following us. Unbelievable. HELP!!!! Um, I'm not sure I want to see the footage on that other card... Yeah, I'm quite sure that I don't. Where'd that come from?? Anybody see anything? Anything???? I think it came from that direction... Cross... You see anything? Who is it?? Hello... What's up? Hey... Lotta commotion last night, did you guys see what happened? Last night? I ate a frog... It was a toad! It tasted like shit. Told you it would. D'you um... catch anything? What's that? It's a video camera. What fer? For capturing video. You gonna capture me?? No, it's for, like... shooting. Shooting??? You can't shoot me! I'll shoot you! I can't... Did you see a guy last night... Devlin? No, last night... just a frog. Toad! Did you see a blond guy??? What about her? That's not blonde. Somethin's not right. I'm going in. I'm right behind you man. Stay back. We'd like to take a look inside... alright? Are you shootin' me? Just a minute- It's gonna be just a minute Stay out here, okay? That okay? Okay? We'll keep a lookout guys. Oh my God, these guys can not be serious. There's no way they live like this... Uhh- The last two houses were in better shape than this one. Hmm. Nothing here... Except disgusting and mold... Cross!! THIS IS MY HOUSE!!!! GET OUTTA MY HOUSE!!! This is my house... Easy man! Awww man. Awww... Cross, You okay? She's not here, we... we gotta go. Yeah, we'd better go. ...bad idea. I threw it on the roof! Yeah, so they'll go up and get it. Leaving another crazy person armed in these woods? If hunting's how they eat they keep the rifle! Where the hell you guys from?? Jesus! We'll find Raven... We'll meet up with Cross's brother... We'll all go home... and live happily ever after. We could be back by nightfall. But we're only a mile or so from our final location! Look, I don't think it's a good idea. We need to go get help. So you guys are heading back?? Ensa and I are, yeah. And whoever else wants to come... Fine by me if you ALL go! I'm not leaving here without Adam. Good luck. I hope you all make it back okay. I'm staying. So am I. ...follow this ridge about a mile east you could go south straight from there. Works for us. And our final house is about a mile north- northeast where we're gonna meet up with Adam and group one before nightfall. Okay. I'm hoping we can make it to the car and gone by then. Yeah if you can keep up. Okay... Well... We'll bring help. I promise. Thanks man. Jack, if we find Raven... WHEN we find her, we'll let you know. Okay, who here thinks those two were urbexers? What do you mean? I'm tellin' you they were cops or something. I saw some of their tech gear and It's not your ordinary everyday shit, okay? Like what? Like shit I've never seen before. Okay and... I heard them talking at the burned-down house in some sort of agent-speak. and that place had charred, half-buried human remains! What?? I know, right? And then they said not to say anything about it... I mean what the fuck! Madhouse is right. They're not who they are pretending to be. Well since we're all coming clean, there was a dead body under the stairs at our house too. Fuck! They could be feds. Oh, Cross don't start on that, man. Let's just go find Adam and get the fuck outta here! If they ARE feds, the only help they're gonna bring scares me more than anything out here. Wow... ya know I've heard of paranoia, but... Dutch, do you remember Thompson Bell? The only person I ever met more paranoiod than you. Know where he is now? Um... I do not, Cross, no. No one does, man. That's the point! Feds came to "help" him too, an armed detail of eight suited up in black marched him off to neverland... Wai-what... where? Don't listen to him. Off the face of the planet, that's where. Look, if the feds come to frog-march you away, don't expect due process. That's all I'm saying. Jesus Cross! Whoa... Kat would've loved this. Mm hmm. She always loved stone. For sure. Okaaay... She'll just have to settle for our stellar photography. Kat... Kat's your fiancÃ©e? And Dutch's sister... crazy. Mm hmm She's coming up here? No. She was going to, but had to leave town. Got back last night was the plan. Are you sure she wouldn't come up anyway? No. No way. Not unless she arranged to meet us here, no. Can I ask you somethin'? How can you get a sense of somebody you don't know, somebody you never even met... but not your best friend? Look I-I don't blame Raven for leaving, I wouldn't wanna be up here with us nut-jobs either. Who says I don't get a sense of Raven? I have a very clear sense... and she didn't leave for home. That it? Last house... that's it. Hey Cross... Adam or no Adam, let's bolt after this, yeah? Stay here with Jack. No. I'll go in. Adam? Adam... Adam? Adam... Anyone??? Adam???? Oh my God-Raven! Ensa... Um... This is my play-ground... Fuuuuck! Shit! This is my play-ground Oh no... Well this sucks! Oh my God... Maybe we should go. Where are they? WHERE ARE THEY!!!! Whatever you do... Don't... go... down... stairs. No no no... No... No! CROSS! WAIT!!! Awwww man! No! No Cross!!! Cross Don't! No! No! No... Oh my God... Adam???? My God HELP!!! ADAAAAAM!!! Cross I'm so sorry man... Hey, is there something you can do... or, you know... say that can help him? If we wanna get outtta here we need him. The earth that we walk on, it warns me. It's impossible to ignore. I feel the hate... I feel the blood. The woods are talking, we all feel it. Source... I thank you for your understanding. And for the visions you give us which help us to see our path ahead. Thank you for your grace. Adam... Even as you transition to the light... Send Cross a sign that you, even before you came to this world... chose to move into the light in this way. That you are in peace... ...Ask that your guides and master guides help to guide him at this time. Help me to call in your ancestors to help give him support. Wrap him in energy. Whisper his name. Drain all the fear and the anger from him. Give us strength. I'm calling on the Overlighting Deva of the time-space continuum... In this moment All things we remember can not be erased or undone. You are my guide... my hope my strength. I know that you protect me... Us. ...which appears to surround us be instantly transmuted into love by that light. And if transmutation is not to be done... I beg you to surround this one. whisper his name... Protect us. ...No way we should go anywhere in the dark. Yeah, that's... that's what I'm saying. We should camp now. The cars are hours from here. How close are we to the stone basement? Well we can't all be asleep that's all I'm sayin'. Yeah... No Devlin this house, not tonight. We need to stay together. You knew... didn't you? What? You knew, just... tell me. First of all, I don't KNOW things, I FEEL things. Did I have a feeling? Yes. Which I wasn't trying to hide from you or anybody. And feelings don't always translate to knowledge or physical fact, so you... I want to know how my brother died!! Take it easy brother, come on... At the hands of a vengeful soul. The evil in these woods has taken the lives of many. The evil? You mean HIM. Devlin. He's in a very dark place. We gotta make damn sure he doesn't show up here tonight. Alright. well then, you guys get some rest. I'm gonna keep watch up there on the ridge. About... last night. I uh... I was wrong about you. No, man you weren't. Now, um... I'm gonna do something I haven't done in awhile, and... make myself useful. Shit... Shit! Oh shit... Oh shit... Shit. Shit. Shit... A-ah-aa H-h-hey... What... are y-you doing? Okay Raven... Out you go! Okay... Bless his heart. The guy did his best. Don't wake him... Here let's go back and make some noise so he doesn't know we found him... Four hours straight back, I think... How you doin' on batteries? Ahh, I got like forty six minutes left, so not good. Then put it away! What are you still recording for anyway? Evidence... People are gonna need to know what's goin'on up here. Especially if... Ohhhhh... Anyone tell me who's idea it was to pass back by these lunatics? Their shack wasn't on the map! Aw what the Fuck... [radio} Daaa dah, Da daaaa... That maniac! Is he messing with the cars? What is that? Who is that?? Shit! MOVE!! C'mon! Go! Go! Go! This is my house!!! What about Raven's camera? Her camera wasn't in the tent. We never found it... How much farther is it?? Maybe an hour. We can rest in the car... Oh my God THANK YOU! Yes! We did it! Thank you Jesus. Let's get outta here. Jax, can I ride with you? Where's your car? Well, I got dropped off. I just figured somebody would take me back over the covered bridge. Of course I would but that's Raven's car. Damn... Cross, this thing better not be rigged to explode... you're the only one here with wheels, dude. Let's get the fuck outta here. Well, Ensa left with HIS car at least... Um... We are leaving- yeah? Cross? Cross... you will take us back, won't you? Yeah... I'll take ya back. Cross don't do this. You need to back down brother, come on! Get in! I thought it couldn't get any worse... Oh, God help us. Okay... ...Who art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy name... You need to let this go Cross. This will not end well as long as you stay up here. You're wasting your time Jack. Just let him go. I'll take you beyond the covered bridge to the old diner on two eighty six. Kat will come get you. God damn Cross! ...as we forgive those who trespass against us. Here he comes... Here he comes!!! And there... they... CROSS!!! GO!!!! The fuck happened? Ev-Everyone okay? Aw, your fuckin' head is all busted up, dude. Cross, what the fuck??? What happened? I don't know... Go! Alright. Aw man... Fuck! This is really fucked up man! Ahhhh! Put your foot here. Okay... Oh my God... One step at a time... just one step at a time-okay. Alright you got your foot there, now give me your hand... You got this... Aww Dutch! Madhouse, how- how's your camera? Uh... good... I think. Um, how's yours? I think it still works! Well-okay, yeah G-uh... God is good - I guess. Although my-my head is bleeding pretty good. Oh my God-Dutch! I know, it's bad. I know, I know... I don't know what to do-Ahhh... Oh my God, what-so he... he covered the road in oil??? Ahhhh that hurts!!! Yes! Okay okay okay- we need to see if you can stand. Alright? Is that Ensa's car? Ugh man! Where'd they go? I don't know... You got him? Let's see if you can put any weight on it, alright? No, no I can't! Oh, this sucks! It's not good- somethin's hurt. Wait-he took his drone? I don't believe it! How we gonna get outta here man? Huh? Cross? Paranoid my ass!! What?? Oh my God... I don't know... What? Oh my God! Agent Michael Cruse, NSA... ENSA! Oh my God... N-S-A... E N S A...

Paranoid... unstable... suicidal, but a murderer Cross? They're here to kill me! Don't you get it?? C'mon Cross, back off. Nob... Nobody gives a shit about you asshole! Really? Agent Cruse??
