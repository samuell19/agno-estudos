Here we go. It should be alright. Got it mounted. Okay. Well, this is going to be my last how-to video. Detroit's local radio station. Thank you for joining us. I'm Tim Baker and I'm here with local hero Gabriel Knox, who many have come to know as the Guardian Angel. Gabriel, thank you for joining us. Yeah, Tim. Thanks... thanks for having me. - So, tell me about this name that guards... - What the heck! Well... Before I get started, I want to confess again that you know I'm kind of a control freak, it kind of goes without being said. With that in mind, I'm running out of time. ...saw me saving some kids. You saved six children, right? When they were drowning. Yeah, they were. I don't believe, Tim, that I did anything anybody else wouldn't do. So I want to do a wilder... a video on how to survive in the wilderness. And there's three main rules. I think you're a hero. I think that's why the community has given you a name such as that. Don't you appreciate that? Uh, you know, quite frankly, I don't really appreciate much of what the community thinks. It wasn't three or four years ago that the community... I can't protect you or prepare you for everything. ...thought that I was an addict, thought that I was just some throwaway kid living out on the streets. And then it took one person that wasn't even a part of this community to come alongside of me and help me through that. So, I don't know... Well, I just want you to know how to survive in the wilderness. There's three things; three main things, and that's what I want kind of you to get a handle on. He's going to kill you. He's going to... he's... This is hopeless. Don't be afraid. This might hurt a little. Move quickly. Here, have a seat, let's take a look at that leg. - No, it's too late. - At least let me help you wrap your leg. You don't come into the tent. Are we clear? You leave in the morning. What if I don't? We need to stick together. Broadcasting program. Crisis has begun. What's real? You still around? Yeah. Where else am I supposed to go? Okay. Listen very carefully. You can come into this tent but... Anything you say. Been living here a while, I see. Do you want shelter or not? I'm sorry, I'm nervous. Well, sarcasm is an overrated defense mechanism. It's called a conversation. It's what people do with their mouths, they talk, they share things. You should try it. I didn't invite you in here for conversation. You're going to help me pull this thing out of my ankle. Oh, I can't help you with that. What? I'm sorry. You just reminded me of someone for a moment. You remind me of someone too. Really? Yeah, an old man that's about to bleed out. Give me the tweezers. Come on. We're running out of time. Alright. No, the tweezers. First the tweezers. There's metal stuck in my leg. I was just thinking that maybe if we get someone just a little bit better suited to handle this sort of thing like maybe a nurse or a doctor. A doctor. This isn't the world... just give me the damn tweezers, I'll do it myself. I'm sorry, I wasn't trying to upset you. The gauze. - Gauze. - In your hand. Here, you're going to have to put it under the wound and you're going to wrap it as soon as I pull this out. It's going to bleed quickly. Wrap the damn leg already. A countdown would have helped. I wasn't prepared. Prepared? Just act. If those things sense we are injured in any way, I can't help us. What is it? All of my food's outside. - I'm sure it'll be fine. - They take my stuff every chance they get. Food, wood, my tools. Do you... Do you remember where you were when the crisis happened? What does it matter? You don't want to let me in, do you? You're in this tent, aren't you? Yes, I'm in the tent, but you're treating me like an intruder. I'm in a situation where I have to protect myself but I didn't invite you here. You chose to be. So now you have to understand that we're both equally susceptible to them. Then maybe I'm here for a reason. I learned to cope. I suggest you learn to do the same. But you don't have to do it alone. I didn't have a choice. You always have a choice. Don't pretend you know what I went through. I went through the same thing, David. We all went through the same thing when the crisis... Well, the situation was out of my control, so I took what little control I had left and found a way to make it work. Shh! How many of them are there? Sounds like a few. I've never heard them like this though. Something's wrong. I'm sorry. You got a plan now? You got some worldly wisdom to share? Because now would be the time. Actually I do, but... I need your pants. Excuse me? Hear me out. You said that these things are drawn to the injured, right? I'm not taking off my pants in front of you. David, please. I'm trying to come with a solution. I need your help. And taking off my pants is going to help you fix this? Please, I'm asking you to sacrifice your pants, not your life. Give an inch, take a mile. David, please. Fine, fine. Thank you. What do you think you're doing? We need to get rid of anything that's human scent. I told you I have no meat in here. It's all outside. Okay, so if the meat is outside, then that's where we need to go. I'm not going outside. You don't have to. My problem, my solution, right? No it's... it's our problem. Not the time. Sorry. Here. Please. Don't lose this. It's old. I've only lost one thing in my life. But I think my luck is starting to turn around. Come on. You can do this. This is the first rule. This is the most important rule. So I want you to really listen carefully to this. It's all about the knife. That's right. I know you're going to think it's crazy, but that little knife is going to be your ticket to salvation. It's what provides for you. It's what sustains you. That knife is more important than your canned food, than your shelter, it's what you need to survive. Don't forget it, it all starts with a knife. Rub this on you. - What the hell? - All over you. It'll help mask the scent. - You have no... - Do it, David, please. Solutions. Solving problems. Alright, alright. I got it. What just happened out there? Your life, it helped. Well, it was pretty stupid. Well, the meat and your bloody pants are buried so... When we get injured in any degree, our body gives off stress hormones. Those things can smell them up to a mile away. I'm sorry, what? They feed off our stress, our injuries, like a giant piece of metal sticking out of my leg, an example of something causing stress. You can try to bury everything, but just know that doesn't solve the problem. Yeah. Well, we can handle it, considering you're holding Excalibur there. This isn't a game, and this is not a toy. Duly noted. Small mysterious pocket knife is off-limits. How did you know they will be drawn to blood or stress or whatever? I've... I've been studying them for some time now. But covering up the scent should do something, right? Maybe buy us some time, it's hard to say. Time for what? For us to figure out a way to get you out of here safely. Are you serious? - I told you from the beginning. - Are you even listening to yourself? Do you think of anybody other than yourself at any moment? Can you think of anyone other than yourself just for a second, just for a change? Having you here has put me in danger of them, and quite frankly, it's put you in more danger too. Now they have the both of us in their crosshairs. So you're trying to protect me? Nice try. The first part I believe, the second part not so much. Don't try to sound sacrificial right now. Don't you tell me about sacrifice. You think you've got me all figured out, don't you? Whatever soapbox you think you have to stand up on, get off of it, because it doesn't look good on you. I know who I am, David, more than you know. I bet you think you do until we find ourselves a situation like this, that's when we discover who we truly are. I've dealt with stubborn people before. Not like me. Pretty close. I told you to get rid of this. Yeah. Been a while, eh? Two days. Even then, it was only a sliver of meat. You ate meat? What was it? Yeah, it was a squirrel or something. Probably too small for the bigger animals to see it or even want to eat it. I don't know, it was already dead. Already dead and there was still meat left on the bone. Where did you learn your survival skills? I picked it up along the ways through life. What, reading manuals and nature books? Yeah, something like that. Who taught you to hunt? Um... Learned a little along the way. Um... I'm mainly though, what you would call, a scavenger. A scavenger. So you live off other people. Sure, if that's how you want to look at it. How long you've been out on your own? I know how to survive, if that's what you're asking. I picked up some stuff here and there and it would be nice to pick up some stuff from you too. I'm not a teacher and I'm not a mentor. If we make it out of this night in one piece, my rule still stands. You're out of here first thing in the morning. Don't you get lonely? No. That's a lie. I don't need someone to feel content. People need people though. That's how we're designed. Based off of how someone was raised or how their parents parented them. This is one of my traps. I use this kind of trap for your smaller animals, your squirrel and raccoon. Okay, so we're doing this now. Well, if you're going to survive, I think you maybe know a few things. Yeah. Right. Okay. The trick, you see... you're going to have your larger animals come snooping around trying to steal from the smaller animals. But don't the smaller animals die anyway when they eat the bait? Yeah. And isn't that like stealing? - Taking what is not meant for you is stealing, period. - Okay. Okay, so what do you use for bait? Berries, acorns, whatever I can find. Again, this tramp specifically traps the smaller animals, and then I use those animals to trap the much larger animals. And where are the traps you use to catch the larger animals? Oh, you know where those traps are. We had quite the encounter with one of them in the woods today. You have all those traps set out there to catch food? Yeah. Have you ever accidentally caught one of them? No, never. They're smarter than that. It's safe to assume that the fire keeps them at bay. I'll do it. Do what? - Get the fire going. - No. You're injured, and someone has to do it. Are you sure? I wouldn't be giving it to you if I wasn't. What the hell? What are you doing? You're safe, David. I saved you. Why would you save me? Save yourself. Believe it or not, David, sometimes saving yourself starts with saving somebody else. Let me leave. David, calm down. Damn it. Calm down. It's not safe out here. It's begun. I know it's not safe out here, David. You just have to calm down. Relax. You dropped it while you're out there. You don't remember me, do you? You don't strike me as the type of person that would forget a client. Of course, I look a little different now. Gabriel. You survived? David, I need you to see something, please. What? It's one of my socks. Who's this? Is this you? Oh God! Okay. Just sit down. It's okay. Okay. It's okay. Sit down. Relax, David. I'll watch your back and you'll watch mine. So why be out here? Why be so nonchalant about being out of the only place that has made me feel safe? The safety was what? Living in a tent? Pissing in a bucket? I get that you've been forced to live like this, but every now and then you have to get out, you have to live. I mean, you have to want to be alive. Other than that, what's the purpose? What's the purpose to fight? To survive? You don't get it, do you? If living in that tent all alone makes me feel safe, then I will. It's not deep. It's not rocket science. It's a simple solution. That's all. Look, I won't argue with you, the tent has kept you safe from them. But when was the last time you felt something? Felt loss, felt pain? You know, it's okay to feel something every now and then. Before the crisis, I helped people. I helped them through tough times, through moments of weakness. I enabled them. I sat and listened and allowed that behavior to continue because it was all a part of the healing. Now it's more apparent than ever that we need to embrace the bad, sometimes more than the good. The good comforts us, the bad grows us. Without the bad, without these monsters; we live in a world that would cease to grow. It's called balance. So where was I when the crisis began, when things truly got out of control? I was living in a world of comfort, in a long and stilted season of zero growth, zero balance. Now I survive. What if there is another way, a better way? What if you didn't have to learn alone? Sometimes we just don't have a choice. The sooner you learn that, the longer you'll survive. Rule number two. Surviving in the wilderness is brutal, that's right. I hate to say it, but it's going to be a tough one. You're going to have troubles with your shelter. You're going to have difficulties trying to figure out the pattern of finding food, finding water. Then you're going to be hit with the elements, a lot of surprises out there. You're going to feel... Like you're the loneliest person on Earth. And then you're going to get some luck. Don't take that for granted. Always remember, your knife is your source that will sustain you. Do not test nature. I'm going to say it one more time. Do not test nature. Yeah. I think it's safe out here. Oh yeah? Don't get your hopes up. No, I'm serious. I don't hear them anymore. And I need you to know something. I know we're in a situation tonight, but I'm glad we're here together. We're going to make it through this and you could trust me. No matter what happens, I'll always be right here... Do not respond to anyone for anything... No matter how you would take that. I see the way that you look at me. You think you can take advantage of me, that I'm weak. I would never. For the longest time I wondered why I was running out of food, why my tools of all things were being taken by those things. I thought I was going crazy. Then one night, I get caught in one of my own traps. Ironic, right? And out of nowhere comes a stranger to help me. One thing leads to another, and finally, alone in my tent, I find something that I'm missing, a blue screwdriver with my name on it. - I can explain. - If you saw me in my trap, you knew I was going to die. Why not go back to my camp, steal everything and be off wherever you came from? I've been watching your routine. I'm going to tell you something, David. You may not want to hear it, - but I need you to be calm. - I am calm. Tonight, when we first met, it's not the first time. When you were traveling to this very location, you were distraught. It was written all over your face. You didn't want to live in that tent, but you know you needed to. I think it's time to leave. I watched you from a distance after that. I watched you continuously, how you survived, how you kept it together. You were stronger than me. And I admired you, and I still do, but something began changing... - Stop. - You started skipping your routines. It happened more and more. You would catch less and less food. But luckily, I learned how to hunt from watching you and I would hunt myself. I would put the food and the traps for you but then you began to forget where you put the traps. You think I'm stupid, kid? You know how this is going to play out. And then today, the dog. I knew it will give us both some meat, and I trapped it, but when I went to kill it, it got loose. You found it first. - You killed it on your way out this... - No, I saw that dog. - I didn't kill it. - You're getting worse, David. No. No. You're wrong. Let me help you. Go. Go! I think you've done enough here. I knew I couldn't trust you. Don't make me tell you again. Go on. Leave! Fine. If you don't leave, you're going to die alone. David, please don't be stubborn. Let me help. Don't pretend to know me. You don't know me. We don't know each other, we never have. You are weak. You're not a survivor. You have no business being out here. It's hopeless, you're hopeless. Do you understand? You need to leave! No. No, no. Please. No! No! No! No, please! No, no! No! No! David! David, help me, please! David, I'm sorry! Please help me! No! No! Help me, David! - Help me! - She is gonna die. Get away from me. I left you high and dry, didn't I? Everything happens for a reason. Those are your words, not mine. I'm not that ignorant anymore. Yeah. Well. I could use a little bit of that ignorance right now considering I'm staring at a guy I haven't seen in 10 years. How did you survive? What's survival to you, David? Staying alive. You sure have changed since the last time I saw you. They took it all away from me. Not all of it. You're a good man, David. Don't let what happened to you, what happened to me, what's happening to all of us determine who you are as a person. Let's get going. This is our problem now. We're in this together. Whether you like it or not. No, no! David! David, help me! David! Help me! You are not enough. They're better than you. You'll never be. You'll never be. Ever. No, no! No! Hey. Hey. Please. Please. Can you hear me? Come on. We got to get out of here. Whispers. They want you in that tent, David. Can you walk? Come on. Come on. Get up. It's not safe out here. They're never gonna stop hunting us. We need to hide. Ah! My leg. Take the torch. Don't move. They can't see us if we don't move. You came back for me. - I want you to get inside. - No. - What? - The whispers. They want you to rot in that tent, David. They want both of us to rot in that tent. You hit your head. They don't whisper. You don't know what you're talking about. David, I can get help. I can't help you. Don't you get it? No one can. I let you get taken. I let that happen. It was never about not wanting you around. It was about me. Call it selfish, I don't care. But I can't help you and I never could, and I don't want you around to remind me of that. I can't do this alone, David. I'm tired of pretending that I can. I can't. And just because you're... Doesn't mean you can't help me. Like the people you used to help. I need you. I need your strength. I'm not who I used to be, alright? - Is that what you want to hear? - No. No, I want to hear that... that maybe in this one moment during the hardest time of my life, that you're here, for me. I can't stop them. Help? What kind of help? The kind that requires us to walk away from this godforsaken tent, David. Will you come with me? This is my home. I built all of this. I know, but it's time to leave it behind now, because the truth is, David, it's killing you. And what if we die out there? Then we die the best versions of ourselves. The versions before this crisis hit. Okay. We move first thing in the morning. Okay. This is rule number three. Now I want you to listen to me on this one, because you're going to think that I totally lost my mind, but you got to be willing to give up everything at the drop of a hat. That's right. If you're ever compromised by the elements or... But you got to go, you got to move. Remember. Surviving isn't about just you alone. It's time. I made this for you after you fell asleep last night. - David. - No. My leg's getting worse. It's not much farther. I don't think. You don't think? It's not much farther. Hold it. It's not safe out here. Even if we got the Sun at our back, it's going to get dark eventually. We'll be safe. What about the food? We don't have our traps. It's just stuff, David. We'll get new stuff. It's not like you aren't resourceful. What do you mean by that? Oh, you think I'm supposed to believe that you just happened to stumble across all that stuff in your tent back there? I may do with what I could find. I might have got a little lucky. Hmm, so you can trust someone other than yourself. Where did you get that knife? It was my father's. So it's seen some time, eh? It's seen more than a little time. He was a marine at the tail end of World War II, the Battle of Okinawa. He was also kind of a religious guy to a fault. He brought back this knife and a whole lot of anger. Anger. He used to drink and beat my mom. He came after me a couple of times. We'd always see that look in his eye and he'd hold this knife up and see, if we didn't obey him, we'd burn in hell. That's when I learned how to hide. I figured he won't hurt me if he can't find me. Is that all you remember? Yeah. Mainly. Hey, but it made me into the man I am today. I'm still alive in this moment. Ah, damn it. David, are you okay? I'm not going to make it. Here. You take this now. Do you think we can go on? Not much longer. You got the knife now. No, no, no. No. I won't go alone. Well, you're going to have to try. David, I should tell you... I need to tell you that... Come on, let's go. No, no. Stop. What's wrong? What's wrong? - What's the matter? - My leg. - But David... - You're not doing me any favors. - But David... - Just listen to me, please. My legs, they're screwed up. I can't even feel them. I think it's an infection or something. What... If you don't let me look, we won't know for sure. - I know my own body. - Please, trust me for a change, please. Okay. What? This... It's not good. Then go. I can handle myself. I don't know. Let me guess. Is this the part that I'm supposed to inspire you to face your fears? It wouldn't hurt. Don't die. Yeah, didn't think so. That night was more than enough to protect you from those things. David. I have to tell you something but I don't know if you'll understand. You need to go. Go ahead. I'll be okay. Go. David, I have to tell you something. - You need to go. Go, go. - But... What made you trust me to handle this? To take this knife? I guess I see a little of myself in you. I think we're almost there. Is there going to be food? Probably. Is there going to be people there? Is it going to be an issue? Seems like everybody's a stranger. Right. I think this is it. No. No! No! This isn't happening! No! No! This is a dream! This isn't happening! - David! - This isn't real! David, hold on! No! No, this isn't who I am! I don't want them to see me like this! Stop! This isn't real! Please. Please. You can have everything. I'll give you whatever you want! She doesn't deserve this! I don't want to forget! Please, I'll give you anything! You can have everything! I'll give you whatever you want. She doesn't deserve this! Please! No, please! Please, let me go! I don't want to forget! Please, help me out! Please! And follow the book or you will rot in hell. David. David. David, please. - Please. - Shh! Don't move. Don't move. No, please... - Go. - Listen, listen. They're gone now. I don't know where they went. Maybe they migrated or something but one of them took you. Do you know where it went? Use knife. - Use the knife? - Please... Knife... Use the knife. You'll never amount to anything. He's going to forget you. This is the place, David. Something looks familiar. It's a safe place, David. I promise. Go ahead. Go. David. Dad. I couldn't find you anywhere. You came home. Kiddo. Can I sit with you for a sec? Sit down. You heard that, eh? No, I was just checking on you. Right. Well, I'm not doing so good today, kid. That's okay. We all have those kind of days, right? More often than not lately. Please. Don't pity me. I love you. I don't pity you. And I'm here for you. And who's going to be here for you? You are. Can I ask you a question, kid? Of course. Am I going to forget who you are? I don't want to forget you. Mary, I love you. You're everything to me. I love you too. And I'm not going anywhere, you're not going anywhere either. And you're going to get better. I promise. - I want to get better. - You will. You're going to get better. Typically those diagnosed with dementia have the tendency to become more hostile and unpredictable as the disease progresses. And as you know already, they will forget who they are and where they are. How much longer do we have? This can be a very hard process to go through. You both need to be strong. Depression, anxiety, most importantly fear. These are all very real things in this situation for you and for him. And it's very important that you stick together and you stay hopeful. How am I supposed to stay hopeful knowing... knowing that this is going to kill him? Treat every day with him as a gift. Help him when you can. Be patient with him when you can't. And love him at his worst just as you did when he was at his best. Hey, dad. Hey. How are you doing? You know, when that doctor told me I had this, you know, how I got through that bad news. You and I, we went on that camping trip up north. Up there I... I wasn't a counselor. I was a dad. Your dad. The man that I always wanted to be. I wish I could go back to that moment with you. This place seems nice, dad. Oh. I suppose. Hey, I want you to take some of my stuff back home with you. You know your mother. You know how she over-packs. - Okay. - She did it again. Okay. Mary, don't worry about me, kiddo. I'm a survivor. I know you are. You always have been a survivor. David. David. David, please. David. David. What happened? - Calm down. - Did he try counseling someone again? - No. - I told him he wasn't counseling anymore. No. His pneumonia has pushed him too far. He's not going to make it through the night. I am so sorry. You need to know he's delirious right now. He's been delirious for months. Where have you been? I can't leave for a week? This isn't your fault. You needed the counsel. He was headed down this path regardless of who was here with him. And he doesn't think that he's alone. What does that mean? When someone enters hospice, a chaplain comes every day to pray with them and sometimes your dad would talk to him. - And? - He... Your dad believed he was being hunted. What? Depression, anxiety, fear. These are very real things. So, in a sense, I guess he was being hunted. We all are in situations like this. - That sounds... - Irrational. I know. But sometimes you need to see things the way that they do to better understand. But either way, your mom believes and I do too that he's been waiting for you. Waiting? He doesn't have much time, but he's been holding on. David. David, please wake up. Wake up. Please. I can't do this alone, please, David. I need you. I'm here, dad. So many things I wish I could think of to say to you right now. David. David, please wake up. Wake up. Please. I can't do this alone, please, David. You remember our trips? The best one was when the tent burned and we were so scared, but you protected us. You told us everything will be alright. And you were so... so brave. Please. It's me. I'm your daughter. It's Mary. I wish I could be brave for you right now. But I'm so, so scared. I don't want to lose you. David. David, please wake up. David! No, please! No. - David! - No. Please, David! I'm not ready. I'm not ready. My assistant finally showed up. Come here. - Hi, dad. - Hey, how are you doing, Mary? Ah. Hey, isn't this fun? Would you like to say hi to big Mary? Say hi. Hey, big Mary. Now, Mary, you're never going to be as innocent as you are in this moment, right? Alright. Okay. Let's say goodbye. Bye, Mary. Bye, Mary, right?
