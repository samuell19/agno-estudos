Lung, this is Keung Remember me? Next month is Shatin Martins' 30th anniversary We all want to see you The principal said to make sure you're coming Where are you? Like everyone here I didn't want to lose I've almost forgotten how it feels to not want to lose "1984" 30 years ago I played a match not many knew about in a field no one knew about Salute I resign myself to your guidance I resign myself to your guidance Lung! Lung! I am Lung This is my story "Wo Che Estate, Shatin" This was my best friend, Wai Not only were we neighbours, we were classmates since kindergarten Charge! Perhaps because he can run faster than me I only ever saw his back Tse Chi Lung, faster! Stop dragging your feet! Go to hell! Still throwing? Come down! Did you get them? Got the old guy Don't run, you little bastards! I was always the target of bullies But he always stood up for me To me, he was a big tree Big trees give good shade Steal from my bro? Want your ass kicked? Want a puff? Piece of shit! It's Ken Choi. Must be that scoundrel's Are you stupid? Who wants to listen to Ken Choi? Ditch it! This is Shatin's lowest-tier school Kei Kok College Damn! Reading Touch again? Man up, for God's sake! No matter how unruly we were we still feared someone That's Principal Lu, aka the Chalk Principal He never missed a shot ls that how you behave in class? You are right, Principal Lu That's how we roll! But when it came to sports, we gave our all Wai always told me, Sports are the male animal's battleground You can lose in anything in life except for sports I prayed that the ball would never land in my hands The District Council is giving its HK$630,000 surplus To schools for sports promotion I'd like to know what you principals think Here! Lung! Lung,shoot! Don't waver! Mr. Tsang This $630,000 I want it all I want to use the money to set up a baseball team Baseball? What's that? It'll be Hong Kong's first ever youth baseball team That was easy Thank goodness the opponent's a moron Thanks, Bye Pitched like he was convulsing Why are we always playing with losers? Beat him up! HK$ 630,000! Good for a 1000 sq ft apartment in City One! Talk about fair allocation! Principal Lu, don't kid yourself about the quality of your students They'll just fight each other with baseball bats Money should be spent on bad students! I always bring this ball with me I believe this ball will change my students! We're... ...in deep shit Have a seat Hey Are you interested in playing baseball? Do you think it was a trap? I think there are daggers in his smile! Are you chickening out? A little But Why? It's just extracurricular stuff! Hurry home and have dinner There were no secrets in a public housing estate I knew dad conned mom into coming to Hong Kong That's why she's always despised him But somehow, I felt more sorry for him From now on, not only am I your principal, but your coach as well Sorry, sir! Class went overtime We're all here I'll be taking you to matches Your opponents will not come from local schools They'll be Americans, Australians and Japanese You mean the World Cup! Shut up, will you? Next, We will be training six days a week What? Six days? I got stuff to do! Principal You might as well kick me out of school! Wai, and Lung 5 minutes late, an extra 25 laps 50 laps for everyone But I was on time, sir! Want me to run with you? Run! Remember! Win as a team! Lose as a team! Those morons are playing Baseball consists of: pitching, batting, catching and running Hit the ball, run around the four bases Return to home plate, and that's one point! What the hell? I have no idea what's going on Did I hear someone curse? Are you a gangster? Everyone 100 push-ups Now! Serves you right! I told you But you were lazy Seriously, such losers Listen Once you're on the team It's not about you it's about the team No matter what happens on the field do not curse! One hundred! Baseball is a defense-led sport The pitcher is crucial. That's where the defense begins Spectators will have their eyes on the pitcher and will often overlook the catcher. Attack begins when the hitter hits the ball To get to a base, you need to be faster than the ball You gain one point after covering all four bases Eyes on the ball! They say only fools were forced to join the team by the principal But for myself, a first-timer, it was the proudest thing I'd ever done My teammate Keung's family ran a food stall He loved to talk He'd fire off like a machine gun Until he was stopped Brother, did you apply for public housing? I did! He's Dung Some years ago, he and his dad stole into HK before the touch base policy was abolished Not all mainlanders have accents Some speak better Cantonese than we do All right! Stop yelling! Water's boiling! Got it! Monitor is our school's only bookworm Looking wimpy gets you bullied Stop messing! Stop messing around! Move it! Wow! Oh my god! She dropped her goods Done washing your face yet? Let's go! Still not back? When did a team of that come to our school? Hi, I'm Wai I saw that kill you made... She ignored you, now she's in the toilet Keep an eye out for me What's your name? This is the ladies room! I know, so? Why are you here? You're my eye candy. Let's be friends Pal, aren't you a few years younger than me? Shouldn't be a problem for friendship I'm going to scream if you don't leave! Tell me your name and I'll go Wai Let's go! Spittoon's here! Wait! Let's go! - You go first! - I go first? I go first? Wai You two come out right now! Was it fun going to the ladies room? If the cops were called, You could end up in jail! Stand and contemplate your deeds! "I will never enter the ladies room again" It's all your fault! What? Never seen someone get punished? I read Touch because of this girl I had noticed her for a long time I wanted to get to know her but never got the courage If she knew I played baseball, would she be my friend? Boss! Long time no see, what've you been up to? Got dragged into baseball by our principal Great Those bats could smash some heads! Frankly, I envied him He was well-connected and bold with girls I was so awkward Save your breath, Keung Three Fingers Hurry up! Now watch me! No way! Just look at you! Wow! Genius pitcher? Save your breath I'm the only one fit to pitch Lung, you be the catcher, catch the balls I pitch Think you're the boss? - Why don't you - Good idea pitch and catch, and be the spectators too? Got it, Mr Tsang Don't worry I won't let you down Would you set up the team without the money? Soon, we had a name The Shatin Martins Bring your stuff, come to the field with me We're playing our first game Wow! With Japanese or Caucasian chicks? Most of Hong Kong's baseball fields were built on service reservoirs This is the Japanese team's field Shut up! Coach Choya This is Coach Lu from Hong Kong See you later Gosh! Not with them!

And you call that heroic? Let me show you how it's done! Bro, three outs Next inning! Didn't listen when I read the rules, did you? Come back! Wai You're only good at bluffing Get some brains, dumbass The ball! Got finger cramps? You come and pitch then, smart guy! Oh! Is it a homerun? Result of today's match Taichung Little League 39 Shatin Martins 0 Taichung Little League wins! Don't tell anyone what happened today Worried they'll know you're physically challenged?

Let's go It's no fun The whole field's yours, smart guy! I already told you not to waste your time You can't change those delinquents Lu, you took the money, and you lost the game What a boss! It was a friendly match If you had won, it'd be like your team was picking on little boys It's my fault. I'm the one to blame I owe you an apology Sorry Come, have some more Come I paid for it with my own money Not with the HK$630,000 You're poor... so hang in there! Watch out!

Sweetheart, where do you live? How come I've never seen you? Scared? Don't be scared What's your number? Let me call you What are you looking at? Hey, why are you sprawled out here? Don't be such a sissy I was just playing around Man, I still need it Hey What? Take a wild guess Which of us will leave this ghetto first? How would I know? What a question That year, Shatin became increasingly busy New Town Plaza was built; Yaohan opened its doors Dragon boats raced on Shing Mun River for the first time Many people moved here Many people moved away For ghetto boys like us, success meant being able to leave public housing I think we need a slogan How about 'Shatin Martins, Strike'? What 'shine'? 'Strike' is an English word that means good shot In a match... Shut up! Just use Shatin Martin, Shine! Shatin Martin! Shine! Nope Know what you're doing wrong? The leg! What about the knee? The knee should be higher Not high enough? It's okay to lean backwards Very good! Very good! Again, again Face me Ready Higher, right? Ready,1,2,3 1, 2, 3, higher! You peeked under my skirt! What the hell? You hit me with a ball, and now you're still at it? It hurts You peeked under my skirt! Sorry She slept with me What? That volleyball chick! I had wanted to apologize when I saw her again But when I did see her... Lung Why don't you just kill yourself? Look at him, acting all cool Brilliant! He got killed twice in a row Just forget it, I can do better than him His hands are convulsing. Look at him! Whoa! My hand slipped, I couldn't help it What kind of pitch is that, genius? What did you say? I'm talking about you, genius! Son of a bitch! Stop it! Stop! Are you insane? Stop! Why are you fighting? Did someone swear? He did! He said 'pump up and pitch' Yes, 'pump up and pitch' Explain 'pump up and pitch' to me! What is 'pump up and pitch'? Explain it! I think it means... 'Pump up... and pitch' Dung, 4th batter Got it Lik Wong, 5th batter Yes Wai, pitcher Are you serious? Him? That's it for today Lung, come to my office after packing up I want to have a word What's going on? Principal? You can go now What? You can go Go home What happened? Why did it take so long? Nothing, he didn't say a word Didn't say a word? That can't be, are you lying to me? It's true, he didn't say a word No way Was it about the ladies room incident? He really didn't Really?

Everyone's waiting for you, get going! Principal... asked us to swap places You two, plotting against me? No wonder he only asked you to stay that day I didn't lie to you You didn't lie If I quit now, would you quit? You're all jealous of me! It's your show now Watch me make a fool of myself! You want me over there? Just say so Why send someone physically challenged over here? You think I give a shit? What did you just say? This team is a joke, seriously We lost 16 to 8 in that match It was the first time I took off my mask Being the centre of attention did not feel good HEY Do you have a minute? It's the old guy's doing I had nothing to do with it So what? Are you that small-minded? You shamed me in public, and you call me small-minded? Did the old geezer put a gun to your head? When he told you to do it, You could've said no I quit, you quit - that's brotherhood And now we're nothing! I did it on purpose I wanted you to stop hiding behind him and losing your identity Have you seen him? Lung! Shift your weight down No need to pitch too high Ball! I said 'ball'! Monitor! What? What do you think this is? That you could come and go as you please Who said you could come back? Continue How about this? If you could finish 100 laps before sundown I'll forget about what happened in my office Monitor Count his laps Yes, sir What're you looking at? Concentrate! You got someone who can barely coordinate his limbs You think I give a shit? What are you afraid of? I quit, you quit - that's brotherhood And now we're nothing! Fall in Monitor, lap count He ran 50 laps That's it for today Principal! You said so yourself, Win as a team, lose as a team! Sir, does that still apply now? Shatin Shine! What Shine? Save your breath and run! Charge! Thanks for the hard work, Monitor Welcome back! Lung! When you find something that proves your worth It stays with you for life A lot of things happened in Hong Kong that year Many people said Hong Kong was changing The Shatin Martins changed a lot too Shatin Martins! Shine! Principal Lu said no one's indispensable to a team I didn't buy that But my team's performance showed that Wai's absence had taught them how to play well Shatin Martins finally took off We won five games in a row and made it to the semi-finals Missed again Did you confirm the results? There must've been a mistake Are you sure it's mine? How can you prove that it's mine? Because I've only done it with you! I didn't say anything during this meal For I knew A lot of things would change Once I put them into words Stronger steps Have you forgotten? Use the lower back It's the finals after this match Deal with your thoughts and feelings now During the game, Once you're on the pitching mound, you need to focus There's no turning back once you step on It's all about taking that half step Continue!

Shatin Martins! "Mr. Lu, wish you good health and prosperity" "New Territories' first Youth Baseball Team to Take on Japan's Buffaloes" Principal Lu never got married He spent all his time on education and baseball He helped build schools for children in rural villages We even gave him a nickname The 'Mad Dog' Principal As a gesture of recognition, the colonial government Named a bridge on the Shing Mun River 'Sand Martin Bridge' In the face of change, Some learn to adapt and others choose to take it by the horns For me, the greatest change was the tree I grew up with, is not beside me anymore This is the city where I grew up It's become increasingly unfamiliar The 80s were Hong Kong's golden era and it's the era I miss the most That year I won a match no one knew about I also lost something very dear to me "Even though disappointed, do not lose hope" But I learnt one thing Winning or losing wasn't that important The most important thing is having the courage to take that half a step "Principal Lu Kwong Fai founded the first Chinese youth baseball team" "Shatin Martins in Kei Kok Primary School" "Shatin Martins defeated the powerful Japanese Buffaloes" "and won the championship" "Then Shatin District Officer Donald Tsang said" "the team's founding was the most memorable event in his political career" "The team's founding members are indebted to Principal Lu" "for changing their lives" "District youth baseball teams for varying ages subsequently appeared" "The founding members and Principal Lu became the best of friends"
