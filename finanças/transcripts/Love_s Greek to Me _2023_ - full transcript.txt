[music playing] OK. Now I know you're all ready to run off to field school, you've got those big Indiana Jones daydreams, unearthing artifacts, outrunning boulders, looking great in khaki. And while field school might not be quite so adventurous, it is magical. That moment when you excavate an artifact that hasn't been touched in a millennia-- there really is no feeling like it. But always remember the inherent nature of our job. Yes, we are part humanist, part scientist, but we're also a whole lot of detective. So word to the wise-- tread lightly because once you dig up the past, it can never be reburied. [bell rings] Don't forget to turn in your thesis, preferably on time. Thank you. Great job today. Ilana [non-english speech] [non-english speech] You just said, hello, your dog is sacrificial. And I meant every word. What are you doing here? You're just stopping by to say hi? Well, I was in the neighborhood and have a little end of semester gift. [gasps] That is so sweet. Thank you. It's the-- Evil eye that Mati. Dates back to at least ancient Ugarit. I love that you know everything. You didn't love it when you first met me. Yes, it did. I was just flustered. The most beautiful woman I had ever met could also scold me and wreck antiquities? And I'm sure you already know because you know everything. But the Mati supposedly protects against misfortune. Well, then where's yours? I got you. Yes, I will protect you. Thank you. It's beautiful. So on a scale from 1 to 10, what is your stress level about your mom? To put it in Greek mythology, somewhere between Aphrodite and Medea. Babe, stop stressing. I love your mom. But also, you've only spent small amounts of time here in Boston with her. And staying with her for 10 days while she throws my sister the most of the talk Greek wedding history will be, as we like to say, a thing. Well, it'll be a thing I love because it's your thing. You'll see. You'll think My Big Fat Greek Wedding was a documentary. [laughs] Or a cautionary tale. I have to go. We're surveying a location for the new Dabo hotel. OK. Oh, and don't forget, our flight tomorrow is at 8:00 AM, and the airline does not abide by Greek time. I'll pick you up at 7:00 AM the latest. Mike, I'm serious. [laughs] [music playing] Fresh off the racks. I designed it with your trip in mind. Mom, it's beautiful. I love it. Thank you. Now, promise to send me lots of photos. I'm just so excited for you. Me, too. Beaches and baklava and-- do you remember Katherine Lee? Yeah, from undergrad? Yeah. So she's heading up a field site near the ancient ruins of Thera. So I'll be able to see her, maybe dig a little. You'll be in your happy place. Yeah. And Mike will be in his. I mean, as long as he can get over the stress about his mom. Yeah, who fortunately doesn't stress you out at all. No, not at all. She's delightful. And I love Athena. Just every time I talk to her, the first thing she says is, when are you and my Mikale going to get engaged. [laughter] Well, you can't dodge the question forever. I'm not dodging it. It's not been forever. We've only been dating a year and a half. Two years in October. Two years is not that long. I mean, you could be with someone for 10 years. And one morning, they wake up and-- Love, I'm well aware. Look, I just feel like who you marry is the biggest decision you make in life. I know. And commitment is scary. But also, I know that avoiding commitment isn't the solution. And yes, that's said by a woman who hasn't been past a fourth date in almost three decades. Hon, look, I'm no expert at relationships. But what I do know is you and Mike have won the lottery in finding each other. So don't worry about Athena. She'll behave. Just enjoy. You're going to Greece. [laughter] Here. Oh, yeah. Can't forget that. [music playing] [non-english singing] I loved Athens when I was there. But this is-- The best part of Greece? You'll love the hotel. I grew up there. [gasps] Wait a second. Why didn't they put this together before? A charismatic matriarch running a Grecian isle hotel while planning her daughter's wedding. We are literally entering the plot of Mamma Mia. I don't know. I never saw it. Wait, what? Isn't Mamma Mia like a national treasure in Greece? You are adorable American. Wait. But will there be spontaneous bursts of dance and song? Well, we're Greek. So, probably. This is going to be so much fun. Hold that thought. [non-english singing] [non-english speech] Did all really come out to greet us? No, this is just part of my family. [non-english speech] Ilana, I want you to meet my aunt Maria. Hi. And my uncle Yorgos. Nice to meet you. You can call him George. OK. This is my aunt Eleni and my uncle Janez, Janez. Nice to meet you. John for short. OK. And my grandparents. Papu and Yaya. May I call you yaya? Yes. Why you no come before? Maybe we die soon. That's how the Greek say hello. Oh, OK. Ilana! Ilana, I'm so happy you're here. What about your big brother? Yes, yes, you too. But Ilana finally gets to meet Chis. Ilana, this is my fiancee, Christos. Pleased to meet you. I was so sad to miss the last trip to the states. Yeah, you were very miss. Ilana, there you are. I am so happy to see you. I thought you would never come to Greece. Hi. Mikale, you finally made time to come to visit your mother. There's that famous Greek guilt I was telling you about. Ramona. You're wasting away without my cooking. Come, let's see eat. What about Ilana's family? Mama, the place looks great. The work on the pool is excellent. Yeah, really. Your hotel is amazing. [non-english speech] I always wanted a hotel on the Caldera. And my Nikola, may he rest in peace, built it for me. It's amazing that he was a hotel architect, you're a hotelier, and you're a hotel developer. And Alex runs the hotel. Hospitality is in the Atlas blood. Later, I will give you the whole family history. [non-english speech] So we have moussaka, saga gnocchi, souvlaki, one more, and I understand it's your favorite, baklava. So this is an old family recipe passed down through the generations. Thank you. That is more than enough. Come on. Alex has a table. Ilana, over here. So I have something to ask you. My cousin Lea is going to be my [speaking greek].. That's the Greek equivalent of maid of honor. But she won't arrive until right before the wedding. So I was hoping you would be my American maid of honor. You'd be part of the ceremony and help me with wedding duties. I would love that. Oh, can I host a bachelorette party? Yes, that sounds great. Thank you. Hey, what about me, your [speaking greek]?? I have four brothers. So the job is already taken. But you could be my honorary [speaking greek].. Just don't tell them. All of the title, none of the work. And I can just watch my sister get married. I wish papa was here. He's here. And it's one of us. And he would be proud. Did she ask you? Yes, she did. And of course, I said yes. So you need a dress. Tomorrow, we go shopping. No, no, mama. Tomorrow, we're going to [speaking greek].. OK, I'll make a picnic. No, mum. I meant just the two of us are going, OK? Oh, forgive me. I thought you came to Greece so we could all be together. Athena, of course, we'd love for you to come. See, Ilana wants me to join. I'm going to go grab some drinks. [non-english speech] Sorry, did you want some privacy? Is privacy an option in this family? Mama, I didn't invite you because I want to propose to Ilana. Finally. And Atia castle. So special. I'll bring also mama Mom, I think what Mikale is trying to say is that he doesn't want you third wheeling his once in a lifetime moment. Oh, of course. Because who am I but the woman who birthed you and raised you and sacrificed for you at every turn. Fine, mom. Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. But give us space, OK? Of course. Thank you. Who's doing the flowers? Nobody, nobody. I'm doing this simple, intimate, my way, hopefully. I'll still bring a picnic. You know, you can say no to her. How's the wedding planning going? OK, I'll come tomorrow and I'll distract her. Why not? We should invite the rest of the family too. Can we all fit? [music playing] Isn't this just the most exciting day of your life? Yeah, I am very excited to be here. Mom, come on. Let's go and explore a little bit. Yes, go, go, go. Have a nice trip, mom. Bye, bye. Come on. As a child, I used to come here and stare out at the sea and dream of sailing across it. I tried to imagine what my life would be like. Oh, your shoe's untied. [gasps] He's proposing. How romantic. Congratulations! What? From the moment I met you, I dreamed that you would get married one day. Married? Mom, I haven't proposed yet. But you were kneeling. I was taking my shoe. Well, if you tie your shoe in the most romantic place in the world, people are going to think you're proposing. Proposing? Yes! Mama. Tea. Mom, mom, let's go. Let's go. So you are proposing? Yes. And I was going to say that this place is also special because it's where my father proposed to my mother, telling her that she was the light of his life. And when I met you, I feel the same, that you are a light, you're my light. So Ilana, will you marry me? Yes. Yes, of course, I'll marry you. I have another daughter! We need to take a picture. OK. That was fast. Congratulations. Thank you. And the ring is stunning. Mike has good taste. You helped him pick it out, didn't you? I did. He also asked for my blessing. You knew and you didn't tell me? Oh, I'm sorry, hon. It was the longest two months of my life. So are you wedding planning yet? It's going to take me time to make your dress. Mom, we just got engaged. But the dress takes time. I know, but there's no rush. And the dress will be simple, just like the wedding. Nothing big or fancy or complicated. Are you all right, hon? Yeah, I'm good. No, really, I'm good, mom. It's just-- it's a big decision. It's a little scary. But that's OK. That's normal. Honey, I know you're worried. But also, I know Mike is the man for you. If he wasn't, I would have made him pick out a bigger diamond. [laughs] OK, I don't fully understand that logic. But thank you? Listen, mom, I got to go. I'll talk to you later, OK? I love you. Love you too. [music playing] Hey. Love, I know you think marriage is the biggest decision you'll ever make. And I also know the thing is the scariest. Yeah, I do. And that's OK as long as you know that I love you with all of me. And no matter what happens, I will never leave. I don't know if you can promise that. Maybe you don't know, but I do. Darlings, I started a wedding schedule so we can begin planning. Oh, we don't need to do that. Oh, yes, we do. The schedule keeps everything organized. No, I mean, we don't need to start planning the wedding right now. This is the most important day of your life, the day everything changes, the day that you bind yourselves together for all eternity. A day that should be celebrated, all stops pulled out, no expense spared. So I am going to give you the biggest Greekest wedding ever. The biggest Greekest wedding ever. Mm-hmm. I don't know. Just this whole big fat Greek wedding thing, it's not really what I had in mind. So what were you thinking? Maybe a courthouse ceremony, just something small and simple. What about a small simple wedding in Greece? You, me, ceremony on the beach. That does sound beautiful. But won't your mom be disappointed? She'll be OK. Will you talk to her then? Because I don't want her to dislike me just because I'm not giving her the dream wedding. One, she could never dislike you. Two, it will be a dream wedding, our dream wedding. Three, I'll tell her, don't worry. Thank you. [speaking greek] my daughter. OK, you eat and then we have to go. The tailor is waiting for us at the dress shop. The maid of honor needs a special dress for the occasion. Ah, OK. I do want to book a restaurant for Alex's bachelorette, and I told my friend that I would meet her near the ancient Thera ruins at 1:00. Well, I can help you with the restaurant, plus it's only 10 o'clock. OK. Did you by chance talk to Mike? About what? Nothing. Never mind. Eat. Oh. Hey, where are you going, princess? Don't you have a job to do? I'm on my break, mom. Break, OK. What are you doing today? Well, mama wants me to go see a vineyard for a new hotel. So it's official. You're back for two days, and you're already doing whatever she wants you to do. I'm trying to help. And I know that I can say no. But I don't see her as much as you and the guilt-- I miss you a lot. You could visit us. Or maybe Chris and I can come to the States for a bit. Really? I can dream. [phone rings] We'll talk in a bit. [speaking greek] Your dresses in the back. Oh, it's already picked out? It has to match the bridesmaids. Right. So while we're here, maybe we can pick your wedding dress. Actually, my mom will be designing my wedding dress. Really? For your wedding? Yeah. Maybe she design your rehearsal dinner dress. No, she'll design my dress. Of course, of course. So maybe we look for inspiration. There's really no rush. No rush, but no [speaking greek] procrastination. I never give in to [speaking greek],, not with my hotels or my businesses or my family. I never waited until tomorrow. [gasps] This is gorgeous. It's really not my style. But you don't know until you try it on. It would make me so happy just to see you in it. And since we're not going to dress shop together-- [laughs] You look like a princess. Thank you. It is very pretty. But no, it's just not right for the occasion. What do you mean? Well, it's just not me. Maybe it's the new you, the bride you, the wife you. Well, the wife me will still be me. Oh, that's what everyone thinks. But then you get married and the fabric of your identity changes. [laughs] You're not going to believe this, but this looks so much like my wedding dress. I can believe that. To be honest, I think I'm a little jealous. I would give anything to marry my Nikola again. It's been two years, but it feels like yesterday. Two years without him. Athena, it's lovely. But my mom's going to design my dress. Of course. It's beautiful. You are going to be the most beautiful maid of honor ever. Oh, no, I'm going to be late. You can go tomorrow. Today, we'll go find a restaurant for the bachelorette. OK, let me check in with my friend. Oh, I forgot my sunglasses. I'll be right back. OK. Katherine, hi. No, no, no, I'm actually running errands with Mike's mom and I got a little behind. Could I come see you tomorrow? OK, great. Yeah, see you around noon. All right, bye. Everything OK? Yeah. You see, in Greece, people are more relaxed. America is so uptight. Everyone rushing to be somewhere at a specific time. Yeah, respecting people's time is so American. So during the day, this taverna is the best bakery in Santorini. But at night, it is the place to be, the only place to have the bachelorette. I'm sure it's very cute. And they know our family well. So they will take good care of us. I can book it. Oh, don't worry about it. I'll handle the booking. And wait till you try the food. And the coffee is the best in Santorini. I bet it's delicious, but I actually cannot do coffee in the afternoon. I will order you a cup just in case. I really rather not. But you don't know until you've had it. Come on. [music playing] So what do you think the coffee? The baklava is amazing. It's good, but mine is better. I will teach you. It is a tradition for Greek mothers to teach the daughters-in-law their son's favorite dishes. A lot of Greek traditions. I know. It's very special. And what about your family, your traditions? Let's see. My mom designs all my dresses for all my big life occasions. And every year on my birthday, for as long as I can remember, we go to the same Italian restaurant and eat baked ziti. And every year on Christmas Eve, we open our presents at night and then spend all of Christmas morning baking. Yes, but what about cultural traditions, religious, wedding traditions. I don't-- I don't know. I have to ask my mom. Maybe her mom did something. And what about your father's side of the family? I'm not sure. I mean, I haven't seen or spoken to my dad since I was eight. Do you think about him? Not often. I mean, he left when I was so young. So-- I'm sorry. You didn't have the father you deserve. But it's his loss because he missed out on the best thing-- you. Thank you. And my Nikola would have loved you. You think? Of course. You're amazing. Plus, all a parent wants is for their child to meet someone that loves them as much as they do. And I count my blessings that both my children have found that. And as for your dad, I know, these wounds hurt. But they heal when you have your own children. And I can't wait for my grandbabies. Little Nikola. You've already named my unborn children. No, no, no, no. It's what we do. It's tradition. Yeah. Is everything all right? I think it's the caffeine. [non-english singing] Ilana. Oh, my god, you're so cute! Our olive oil tasting has just started. Would you like to try some? That sounds lovely. Can you sit with me? Sure. I am my own boss. But don't tell my mom, who's my actual boss. Speaking of, I heard you spent the entire day with my mother. How did that go? I know she can be a lot. Well, it, comes from love, right? Oh, and don't forget her managably high expectations. Of you? Of everyone, but especially of me. You know, I run this hotel, go to business school, grow the empire, get married, have babies all at the same time. Do you want to do all of that? I would just like for my entire life to not be planned out. Chris and I want to travel, go to the states. You should do that. It's not so simple. I can't just leave her. Oh. Hello, my love. Hello. What did you do today? I went to the other side of the island to look at the property my mom is interested in. There you are. I have good news. I just spoke to the church, and they have booked January the seventh for us. For us to do what? For us get married, of course. Seven is a very lucky number for the Greeks. It's the only day to get married. And this church is very special. It's where Nikola and I got married, it's where Alex and Chris are getting married, this church is tradition, and as you know, tradition is very important. Ilana, the Atlas' are named after the Titan Atlas who was tasked to carry the weight of the heavens on his shoulders. So Atlas means to carry, so we carry on the tradition. Well, I'm sure that we would love to do that. Yeah, mom. But also, Ilana and I need to discuss. Discuss, yeah. [music playing] So I'm confused. What is there to discuss? I thought we agreed on a small simple ceremony. I know, I know, I know, I know. My mom overstepped. She shouldn't be booking our wedding without asking us first. She shouldn't be booking our wedding at all. I'll talk to her. But also, maybe, maybe we shouldn't be so quick to say not to the church. But I don't want a big wedding. But we can have a small wedding, something intimate, more personal, memorable. Let's visit the church tomorrow. Please, please, please, say yes? OK. Thank you. Do you remember what you said to me when I first kissed you? After I recovered from swooning. Exactly, exactly. You said-- let me-- OK, Mike, Mike, where did you come from. I did not say it like that. No, I didn't. Yeah, you said it. No, I didn't. And I think you said that I just stepped out of your dreams. Look at me, look at me now. Maybe I did, I have. Well, that's how I felt. You mean how you still feel. Yes, how I still feel. I stand corrected. And I know what you're trying to get at, that where you're from is better than any dream possible. Swoon. [laughter] There you are, my daughter. You keep sleeping so late. Well, I am on vacation, Athena. Vacation when we have a wedding in a week and errands to run. Actually, I have plans today. I told my friend I'd meet her at the dig site. Maybe you go this afternoon. Athena, I have plans today. OK, you have plans. No problem. [music playing] OK. Hey, you're here. It's so good to see you. What's it been like, three years? No, no. We saw each other briefly at that conference in LA like a year ago. Yeah, sorry. So much history, so little memory. Oh, what's all this? Well, we found the first shard a couple of months ago and the second one just last week. It looks like an amphora, Circa 500 BCE. How'd you take that so quickly? Well, the female figure, well, the folds in her clothing follow a chiton dress dating to around 500 BCE. Exactly. So can I help? You're on vacation. Trust me, this would be a vacation from my vacation. All right, well, have these. Thank you. And we'll make a start. [music playing] You're late. I'm sorry. But I heard that being on time is very American. Sounds like my mother. [non-english speech] Father Adinos christened me, and he's marrying Alex and Chris. Welcome. Thank you. The church looks lovely. [speaking greek] [music playing] So a small simple ceremony might work there. Really? Maybe. I mean, it mean something, special to you, to us. It's history. It's the history that's getting to you. Where are we going? You didn't think this trip was going to be all wedding tasks and managing my crazy family, did you? I mean, where would I get that idea from? You're saying you're not enjoying the family dysfunction. I am enjoying it because I agree with you. And you put fun in dysfunction, my love. [speaking greek],, you're saying the sweetest words. [non-english speech] This is my fiancee, Ilana. Ilana, so happy to meet you. Nice to meet you. Come aboard. OK. Thank you. [speaking greek] Are you ready for some fun? Yeah. [speaking greek] [non-english singing] Petrus and I are friends from [speaking greek],, elementary school. As students, we used to steal my father's boat and go fishing. Now my kids take my boat, and I pretend not to notice. Well, I don't blame them. Your boat is beautiful. [speaking greek] I bet you miss this, huh? Sure, but I take a lot of sailing in Boston. But it's nothing like this. You know, my dad taught me to sail. Most of the time, it would be just me and him out here. And although he's always with me, I feel him more here. So if my mom gets the vineyard, she's going to build a hotel around it. Speaking of, have you been able to talk to her yet? I'm sorry. I didn't. I thought we were figuring out what we want. Oh. Yeah, no, no, no, we are. I mean, I guess I never really thought I would be considering the church, so-- And maybe I do want to have a Greek wedding. I realize that this is part of me. In the States, I always have the feeling of being separate. You never told me that before. I spent many years being Greek Mike. But here, I am just [speaking greek].. And I want to be married that's who I really am. Well, I definitely want you to feel seen, especially by me. But our wedding does need to be about both of us. Yes, but part of us is me, and part of me is this. And I want the same for you, for you to feel represented and seen. I appreciate you saying that. We'll figure it out. Where's your mother necklace? Oh, no, it must have fallen off. What? OK, doesn't matter. We'll buy you another one. No, I'm happy that he's sharing this with me. I just-- I wonder why he never told me before, that he feels like Greek Mike, that he feels separate. I mean, does that mean that he feels separate from me because I don't fully know him or understand him? Of course, he doesn't mean that. It's just a lot. The big family, big cultures, big personalities. Just feels like there's a prescribed way to do everything, especially with weddings. Well, that's tradition. Speaking of tradition, do we have any special Albas family traditions? Ziti birthdays, Christmas baking? No, I know those. I mean cultural or historical or religious. Was there something that you did that was special at your wedding or-- I'm sorry, never mind. No. I just feel that love, weddings-- well, maybe I'm not the best person to be asking for advice. That's not very comforting, mom. [music playing] [non-english speech] [laughter] What's so funny? It's just an old Greek joke. I love a good joke. OK, [speaking greek] [speaking greek] So the cow has the lamb, do you want to go out with me on Easter. And lamb response, no, I can't, I'm spinning. OK, it's a bad joke. It's hilarious in Greek. I bet. Ilana. Yes. Why you no make us great grandbabies. Maybe we die soon. They say this to everyone. [speaking greek] So what should we do today? Go to the beach, hiking? Ilana, there you are. You sleep so late, like a teenager. They've all been waiting to meet you. Oh, you know what? That would be lovely. Except I booked a tasting at the taverna for the bachelorette. I will come with you. They will take good care of you if I'm there. You know what, that's OK. No, no, I want to help, really. And Mikale can come too. [non-english speech] Mama, Ilana's got it. I think it is so fun that you're hosting this. A bachelorette party-- it's so American. Excuse me. I'm sorry. This isn't what we ordered. Yes, it is. This is for the bachelorette cake. Well, what about the dinner? Oh, I finalized that yesterday when you were with your friend. Now we just pick dessert. Oh. And as we're here, why don't you pick the cake for your wedding? Mama, is this a cake tasting? Well, we're tasting cake. But we're tasting cake because you booked us a cake tasting, right? I'm just trying to help. Mama, this is Ilana and my wedding. I'm overstepping. I'm sorry. I always do this. But I'm just a silly old Greek widow who just loves her children too much. Mama, we know that you are trying to help. But it's too much. OK, I'll do better. I promise. But as we're here, let's eat some cake. So which cake you like the best? The chocolate. Really, not the strawberry? No, it was very sweet. OK. You know, I'm going to go order the flowers for the bachelorette? I already ordered them. Oh. Well, then I'm going to go pick out the party favors. I can come with you. No, you know, I'd really love some alone time. Alone time. Another American concept. See you. Hi. I'm picking up a dress for the Atlas wedding. It's very purple. Yes, I have it here. Yep, that's the one. Also, your other dress is ready. What other dress? This one. OK. Thank you. Ilana, there you are. Did you buy me a wedding dress when I asked you not to? You said you liked it. No, you said you liked it. I said my mom is going to design my dress. Well, maybe she can make your dress for different special-- Athena, please, you need to respect my boundaries. Ilana, I don't mean to upset you. You know I love you. I would never do anything to hurt you. But don't you think you're being a little dramatic? Dramatic. Oh, so now you're gaslighting me? What's going on here? Ilana says I'm lampgasing her. Gaslighting. Gaslining. Gaslighting. What does it even mean? It means you take every situation, and you twist it so that you end up the victim. Is what do you think of me? No. No, Athena, I know you mean well, OK? But you need to return the dress. Are you OK? I'm sorry about my mom. I was worried about this. Look, I understand that she has good intentions. But she's driving me crazy. And this doesn't seem like an issue that's going to go away when we leave. I'd like to hear what you think. Yeah. Well, this cupid-like figure is most certainly arrows. That's what I thought too. Yeah. Can I? Yeah, of course. This female figure is probably Eros' mother Aphrodite. So it could be the Aphrodite arrow psyche men. Yeah. Wouldn't know without the rest of the pieces. Well, let's find them. All right. I feel bad you're spending your vacation working. Don't. It feels so good to be back on a dig site, especially with you. And Mike's family is wonderful, but it is nice to have a little break. Oh. What's the gossip? Nothing, just some drama with his mom. Oh, what's she like? She's vivacious and fierce and has a huge heart and has already named my unborn children. [laughter] And I understand that Mike's in a tough spot. But it's strange to see him like this. Anyway, enough about me. What about you? How's life here? Yeah, it's good. I mean, I've been here two years. I love Greece. But also, I'm very ready to leave. I've lived on three different continents in the last 10 years, and my sister and her kids and my parents are all in Rhode Island, and Brown has a faculty spot opening up. You're going to teach? Well, I'm only past my first interview, but hopefully. You love teaching, right? Yeah, I love it. But I actually have the opposite story of you. So I did my field year in Egypt and some dig trips. But otherwise, I've pretty much always been in Boston. I wish I would have been on site more. Well, the sand is always sandier. Ilana, can I speak to you? I want to apologize for gasolining you yesterday. I know. I can be a little-- what's the word-- over-- Overbearing? No. Overly sensitive to other people's feelings. It's because I love so much. I've been a mother for decades, but I'm only just now learning how to be a mother-in-law. So please be patient with me. Of course. Also, I returned the dress. I didn't get a full refund because I had it altered, but that was my doing. Are you hungry? Lunch is being served. I'll be up in a bit. [music playing] So pretty. So these will be for the tables. What do you think? Yeah, they're nice. My mom likes carnations. Did your mom make all the decisions for your wedding? What? No, nothing. I just-- seems like she has a pretty big impact on your choices. Doesn't your mom have an impact? Yeah, of course. I mean, my mom's my best friend. So-- Your best friend? This is just the way it is. [speaking greek] I'm sure my mom told you Atlas means to carry. So we carry on with our traditions and also the sacrifices that go with them. It's a lot to carry. Sorry, but I want to redo it. I'll use the carnations for the in, but for my wedding, I want the roses. Suits you. Really? No. Atlas. We're here. We'll meet you guys inside. OK. I thought we could use this. A Mati bracelet. I'll protect you, and you protect me? Promise. One's missing. That's OK. It's not a big deal. No, it's a bad omen. Well, it would be if we were superstitious. Luckily, we're not. I will protect you even with one bead missing. I would love that. This is a Stefana, a crown. It's for the crowning ceremony which is the highlight of the Greek wedding. They're connected by a ribbon to symbolize a union, two lives becoming one in eternity. Because what is bound can never be unbound. Well, unless you cut the ribbon. I'm kidding. I was kidding. [laughter] So which crown is yours? I don't know. I think I like this one. And it does go with my wedding dress. But we kind of like this one, something a bit more simple, you know? So what do you think? I think it's our wedding. So if my mom gets this property, this will be her next hotel, nestled on a winery. There are definitely easier properties to develop, but this has history. My dad took my mom grape picking here on the first date. That's so special. I'm a little bit jealous of your family's connection to Santorini. Your history is entwined. It's like you have a sense of place, a commitment to the past. That's what tradition is, right? Then your mom asked me about my family's traditions, and it made me realize that I don't really know a lot about my dad or his family or that whole side of my history. And it never used to bother me before, but now I think it kind of does. I've always wondered how you're so interested in the past and yet not your own. It's not that I'm not interested. It's just that it's always been, you know, kind of painful. We'll make her own history. This is Ana Cirtico, a special wine from Santorini. It's unique because of the mineral content of the soil. I just realized that if we get this property, we can make our own wine. We as in like you and me we or like you and your mom we? Well, I'll help my mom. Yeah, I know. But can you do that remotely? I hope so, but I don't know. What are you trying to say? Just that something shifting in me, and I want to be honest about how I'm feeling. Well, I appreciate you being honest. Thank you for understanding. [speaking greek],, would you like a drink? Why, thank you. Where did you come from? Where did you come from? Straight from Mount Olympus into your arms. Can we just stay like this and stare at each other the rest of the night? That sounds wonderful. Our latest discovery. Mount Olympus? That's my guess. So we have Aphrodite and Eros probably at Aphrodite's palace on Mount Olympus. What is that? It could be another figure. Possibly. Maybe Psyche. But we need to find the rest to be sure. You want to dig today? I wish I could. But I told Mike I'd spend the afternoon with him, and then I'm hosting Alex's bachelorette tonight. Oh, no worries. I'll walk you out. So some good news. I scheduled my second interview with Brown. Very exciting. Yeah. I mean, it's two three rounds. But if this goes well-- but also, I decided that whether or not I get the job, I'm definitely heading back to the States in the fall. Who's going to replace you here? I don't know. Do you want to apply? You're more than qualified. I mean, that would be amazing. But I don't think I can. Why? You always said you wish to spend more time on site. Yeah, but my whole life's in Boston, you know. My mom, my friends, my job. And things are much better with Mike's mom. But they'll be even better with ocean between us. [laughter] Gotcha. I'll see you. See you. There she is, our American maid of honor. We're doing our job. What's all this? [speaking greek] They're candy for the wedding guests. It's a Greek custom. That's so sweet, pun intended. [laughter] Here, I'll set you up. OK. Also, I wanted to tell you, Chris and I discussed our travel plans again. And he wants to do it, like now. Wow. I know. But is it crazy to just leave our lives and go to another country and not know where we'll be? No. I mean, Mike did it. Yeah, but that's the problem. What do you mean? I mean, I'm afraid that my mom will be worried that Chris and I will do what Mike did. Why? What did Mike do? Well, after my father passed, Mike told my mom that he would finish his year in Boston, his job, and then come back home. But then he met you. So-- anyway, should I talk to her? Yes, definitely. I mean, she'll understand. Or she'll understand in time. Look, it's your life, right? So I wanted to tell you that I changed the wedding flowers. Why? Because I realized that I want roses. OK, carnations are tradition. But if you want roses, fine. Also, Chris and I will be taking a break from the hotel. To do what? To go to the States, do something different, only for a little bit. And I can get you an entry manager if you want. I don't want a manager. I want a daughter, my daughter. Alex I know, this is a time of change and change can be confusing. But your life is here, your job, your family. You know, Ilana said something interesting about her mom. She said that her mom is her best friend. What an American concept. Parents are not supposed to be friends. They're supposed to be parents. Oh, it's a real estate agent. My love, you cannot drink ouzo in front of this view and look so serious. What's wrong? Nothing. It's just something Alex said. Did you stay in Boston for me? What do you mean? I mean, if you hadn't met me, would you have moved back to Greece? I mean, this is home. Did you always feel this way? Did you always know that you would move back here and you just didn't tell me? Ilana, I didn't lie to you. I never lied to you. I know. I'm just wondering why we never talked about this stuff before, where we'd live, our wedding, what we envision for our future. Are you having doubts? No. Really, no. But if you're worried, you just have to tell me. I know. [music playing] Hi. Hi! This is my cousin in Canberra, Lea. She just arrived. I've heard so much about you. Lovely to meet you. Thank you for letting me temporarily do your job. My Obada and my maid of honor. Now I'm ready to get married. Oh, and Ilana, thank you so much for this. It's perfect, even if you're making me wear this ridiculous crown. It's an American tradition, as our embarrassing toasts. So-- Please, no toasts. Everyone, if I could please have your attention. Alex, I have always wanted a sister. And now I finally have one. Yamas to that. Yamas! Yamas. Alexandra, my dreams came true when God gave me a daughter. But I'm very happy to share that in addition to being my daughter from now, you will also be my business partner because my offer on Gavaros was accepted. Mikale, Alexandra, and I will do this thing together as partners. [applause] Ilana, this is news to me too. But are you going into a partnership with your mom here in Santorini? I just found out about this. I don't even know what being partners means. But don't you think this is all part of her plan to get you to move back to Greece? Maybe. But maybe it's not a bad thing. And maybe we can moved here for a year or two. I knew this was coming. Because it makes sense. How does it make sense when our entire life is in Boston? But our life isn't in Boston because part of my life is here. Is it too much to ask for you to come here with me for a year or two? No, no, it's not too much to ask. It just everything here is yours, your home, your language, your family. And it would be me relying on you for all of that. But isn't that what a relationship is? Us relying on each other. Again, you sleep so late. I've been waiting for you to wake up. I'm making baklava for after the rehearsals, and I want to teach you. Well, actually, I'm looking for Mike. He's gone to Gavaros to meet with the contractors. He'll be home soon. So we have time to make baklava. That is a very nice dress. Thank you. My mom made it for me. It's great. I get to teach you the way my mother-in-law taught me. No, no, no, you put butter every time. Right, butter. Ooh, my mother-in-law. She was tough. You can't imagine. Well, I think I can. We were two very strong personalities. We butt heads a lot which was a waste because I wanted us to get along, you know. I wanted us to have a good relationship. But it was very hard, especially after she came to live with us. She lived with you? Oh, yes after Nikola's father died, she moved in with us. It's the Greek way. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, you need more feeling. You know, actually, I like it with a little less filling. It makes it crispier. Yes, but this recipe needs extra filling. [speaking greek] [speaking greek] Hi. Ah, baklava. So much filling just how I like it. I'm stealing you away. Oh. Wait. Hey, hey, we're baking. Well, we will be right back-lava. Bye. Bye. Actually, we won't. Kids. I was up all night thinking. And Ilana, I love you. And I know we have a lot to figure out. But it doesn't change how I feel. So I was thinking, what if we forget about the wedding drama? You mean like not get married? No, no, I meant elope. We don't have to plan or wait. We can just do it now. Like right now? Maybe not this exact minute. But why not? You can't just suddenly get married. We've been together almost two years. Two years is not that long. Plus, we're in the middle of arguing about a wedding and where we're going to live. I didn't think we were arguing. I thought we were discussing. That's what my parents used to say. But Ilana, we're not your parents. And I know that divorce was messy and your dad leaving was horrible. But I'm not him, I won't leave. How can you know that? I know you love me, and I know that you guard yourself. And I'm trying to be patient. But I don't know how much longer I can wait. Much longer you? Just proposed a week ago. It's not about the proposal. It seems like I'm trying to convince you to love me. Let's get to the reharsal. So what did you think? Maybe New York or Boston? Too cold. California. Too hot. Hi. You look beautiful. Oh, how are you feeling? You nervous? Well, I am a little bit nervous. I'm nervous about the actual wedding and the guests. And I feel like I'm forgetting things and I'm getting things wrong. But about Chris, I'm not nervous. He's probably the only thing I'm completely sure of in my life. Excuse me. In Greek weddings, everything has a meaning. The priest starts with a brief welcome. Then the blessing of the rings. You bless the rings three times, then come the Stefana. With the ribbon you can't cut. Never ever never never until the end of time. Then the wine for the sharing of their lives. And finally, it's a yes dance. These are the first steps of a couple as husband and wife. I never knew you were such a traditional guy. Do I surprise you? Yeah, I think you do. Ilana, are you all right? No, actually, I'm not all right. What's wrong? I don't know. Two years we've been together, and I feel like I'm just now discovering things about Mike that I never knew, like who he really is. And he's a wonderful man. But how could I have not seen these things before? It's all just a bit overwhelming. Our cultures, our upbringings, the family-- You're saying it's us. No, no, that is not what I'm saying. Ilana, I love you. I love you, Athena. And I know you love me. But if we're really being honest with ourselves, I feel like there was always a piece of you that really felt like I would never fully fit in with your family. And maybe now I'm starting to wonder if you were really right. Ilana, no. I did have my doubts, but they were never about you not belonging. It was about you not wanting to belong. I always get the feeling that you want to keep yourself apart, distant from us. My son loves you desperately. He would do anything for you. And yet whenever I see you two together, it's always like you're keeping him at an arm's length like you do the rest of us. Correct me if I'm wrong. No, I didn't realize I was doing that. I'm really sorry. I know I'm not easy. But I'm just trying to get close to you. Mike is lucky to have you. He needs his family. Ilana, you're his family. Or you're supposed to be. You look stunning. Thanks. What? It's just, my mom picked this dress. And I wonder what would I have picked if it had been my choice. Well, that's a good question to ask. And it still is your choice, unless it's too late to replace the dress. Then just remember that there'll be plenty of choices to be made ahead. Hey you. Hey. Are you feeling all right? Mm. You sure? Ilana, I have a surprise for you. More family has arrived. Mom? What? How were you here? Oh, Athena called me yesterday, or I guess still today for me. I don't know when it is. I'm jetlagged. Anyways, Athena called me and asked me to the wedding. We are happy you are here. Oh. Athena, thank you. My pleasure. But don't forget, we invited you to the wedding months ago. Oh, I know. Thank you. But I would have felt like I was intruding. There is no intruding with family. Watch out. She means it. So what are we doing today? Well, I was going to go to the dig site and Katherine finally assembled the amphora. Do you want to come? Of course. Athena, do you want to come? Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm fine. I have so much to do for the welcome dinner tonight. Please come. OK. So it is Psyche accomplishing the fourth task. I'm lost. Catch me up. Well, Aphrodite was the goddess of love who had a son named Eros. And Psyche was a beautiful mortal woman. Who Eros fell madly in love with. And they married and they lived very happily until she betrayed Eros trust and then he moved back with his mother. Forcing Psyche to Aphrodite's palace to beg for Eros back. So clever Aphrodite, she sets Psyche for impossible tasks to win Eros back. But Psyche accomplished the task, the fourth one being to descend into the underworld and bringing back a box of beauty ointment for Aphrodite. And then what happened? Well, Zeus rewarded Psyche by turning her into a God so she could live with Eros on Mount Olympus. So it was a happily ever after. Not for Aphrodite. Speaking of moving to Mount Olympus, did you give any more thought to apply into the job? Oh, I'm trying to get Ilana to apply for my job to replace me here. Hey, Chris. Have you seen Mike? Yeah. Last I saw, he went for a walk to your viewpoint. Thank you. Hey. Hey you. I was hoping I'd find you here. Did your mom talk to you? Talk to me about what? Oh. So Katherine is leaving her field site, and she suggested that I apply. That could be perfect. Sorry. When did this happen? A few days ago. And you didn't tell me? Well, I wanted time to think about it. OK. I have to get ready for the welcome dinner. Sorry. Mike. May I? Please, sit. Thank you again for having me. Honestly, you don't know how happy I am you are here. Well, I'm grateful that you offered. You know, Ilana has a strong personality. She doesn't like to let on when she's having a tough time. But she's also never been very good at hiding what she's feeling. We love Ilana. She's going to be part of our family. We want her to be happy. I know. It's just she's never had a big family. It's all new to her. So it'll be quite an adjustment. So how is Mike doing? Oh, he's hiding it too, and he's good at it. But a mother knows. He's confused. He's concerned. Why do they have to make it so difficult, eh? They certainly put us through turmoil. We're parents. We love when they love, we hurt when they hurt, and we know when our child needs us. And so we pray that we can guide them. Yeah, we just nudge them in the right direction to make sure that they find the happiness they deserve. You understand me exactly. It's tough, this parent thing. If only they knew. You look beautiful. And tomorrow, you start a new chapter. You make a home, a family, partner in the hotel. No, that's not going to happen, at least not when you want it to. Chris and I are going to the states. You're leaving me? You're my daughter. You're an Atlas. Yes. And the Atlas' were burdened with carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders. I know. Well, that's what being your daughter feels like sometimes, like I've got the weight of the world on my shoulders. I'm your mother. Yeah. But I wish you were also my friend. Come in. Hey. Hey. Guess what Alex has me doing. A little last minute wedding dress redesign. Oh. Oh, honey. I'm sorry. I feel like this is all my fault. Like I haven't been the best model of commitment. Mom, I'm an adult. Unfortunately, I can't still blame my stuff on you. But I also-- I know I can't live like this anymore, pretending like the past doesn't exist, but also praying that it doesn't happen again. Well, I don't want that either. You know, my wedding, Well, it was the happiest day of my life. I wore a cap sleeve lace dress that I designed with my mom. Oh, it was hideous by today's standards, but I loved it. And until now when I thought about my wedding, all I could remember was the pain that followed. But now, I remember how beautiful it was, how happy I was, how good I looked. [laughter] And I don't want to let the pain take that away anymore, OK? [music playing] [non-english singing] Mike, hey. I needed to tell you that I'm sorry. I know I've been distant and guarded. It's just, this trip has brought up a lot of issues. This trip didn't suddenly bring up all these issues. You've always had them. You asked why we never discuss about our wedding or where we'd live or our future together. It's because you didn't want to. Why didn't you tell me about your job opportunity here on Santorini? Maybe it's because you don't really want it. Maybe you don't really want me. That's not true. It feels like you're looking for a reason to leave. No, because I wasn't ready. If you're not ready for a wedding, how can you be ready for a marriage? Are you-- are you breaking up with me? I don't know. But I'm wondering if this-- we just don't work. [non-english singing] Ilana, are you sure you want to go? I think Mike wants me to go, mom. Oh, honey, he didn't say that. Yeah, but he said a lot of other things, that I'm not ready and he doesn't think this can work. And what do you think? I want him to be wrong. But I think if I'm not ready, then it's time for me to leave. I mean, why have I been so scared? Maybe he is right. Maybe instead of being terrified about being left, I should have been more terrified about being the one who leaves. I just-- I wish there was some sort of guarantee. Oh, honey. No one knows how it's going to work out, at least not until it's passed. But you can't live your life looking backwards, not like I did, and not in your personal life. And look, don't you think by leaving it just proves him right? Mom, I don't want to hurt him anymore. I know. I know I'm late. But the church needed me and then the caterer needed-- What is this? This is not what we planned. Because I'm not wearing my hair down anymore. Oh, also, I had Susie alter my dress, made it more like the dress I wanted. Good. It's your wedding. You should do what you want to. Alexandra, I know I can be a little-- what's the word-- overbearing. And I'm sorry because I don't want to be just your mama. I want to be your friend. Where is Ilana? Ilana's not coming to the wedding. She's going back to Boston. She and Mike are taking space or something. Taking space? Breaking up? I'll be back. Yes. Please, don't go. No, I've caused enough drama. Causing drama is not a reason to leave Greece. It's a reason you belong here. Anyway, I brought you a little something. It's probably too late, but Psyche, Eros, and Aphrodite, the original monster-in-law. I come from a long line. Anyway, when I saw it, I thought, what if Aphrodite didn't set Psyche those tasks so she would fail, what if she said to her those tasks so she would learn. What do you mean? I mean, maybe I believe she wanted to teach her daughter-in-law how to persevere, how to say no, how to let go of the things you love, but also how to keep a hold of them. Anyway, I'm going to meddle one last time, and then I promise never again. You and Mike belong together. I know I have made it very difficult for you, and I'm very sorry. But I promise, if you give it another chance, I will be on my best behavior. But if you want me to be out of the picture, I will do it. No, no, Athena, I don't want that. I don't. But I would do it because I want Mike to be happy, and he's happy with you. No, he's not happy because I've really hurt him. That's happens. That's not when you stop loving. That's when you love the hardest. How much longer till the wedding? It's supposed to start in 3 hours. So maybe five or six. Will you help me? Excuse me. Where are we going? You are following your mother because she knows what is right. Which is? Look. Oh. I think maybe you should go to her. I'm just saying. I agree. What are you doing here? I was pulled here. Really, I was, because I could finally feel what you were talking about, that guiding feeling, that knowing that something is so right, that pull to come home to you. I'm sorry I messed everything up. It wasn't just this. Trip was a lot of pressure. It was unrealistic. And I got scared. And I get it. I'm scared too. But I'm more scared of losing you. Me too. And I know that we have a lot to figure out like where we'll be, how we'll be, your job, my job, our families. But I really do believe that we can figure it out together. And we can't just run when it gets hard. We have to protect each other. Yes, always. So will you marry me again and sort of for the first time? Oh, speaking of marriage, we do kind of have a wedding to get to. Yeah. Let's go. [non-english singing] [non-english speech] [non-english singing] [applause] Mike, you are my light, my pull, my best friend, and my family. Our journey has taken us across oceans and countries to get us right to where we are today-- together. I want you to know that I am willing to go anywhere that our hearts lead us because as long as we're together, I'm home. Ilana, ditto. You can't ditto our wedding vows. OK, fair enough. Ilana, when I first met you, I realized what I had been missing in my life. I would give you the world if I could. And while maybe I can't give you that, I can give you my world. I can give you my commitments to our world, wherever it takes us. [speaking greek] I love you too. And I'm happy we had this small simple wedding. Well, I think we have different opinions on what simple is. I'm so glad I brought them together. [applause] Repair and Synchronization by Easy Subtitles Synchronizer 1.0.0.0
