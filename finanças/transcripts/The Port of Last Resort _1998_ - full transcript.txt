May, 1939 My dear friends, We see the children only at mealtimes. They are happy and animated, and we with them, especially since we could not find any rest in Berlin due to so much running around in recent times. We will be able to represent two good companies in Shanghai and hope to make a living in the international quarter. At every port representatives from the Jewish relief committees come on board and bring old things and cigarettes for needy travelers. Colombo, the capital of Ceylon, home of the famous tea. The children exchanged stickers from the Lloyd Triestino for pineapples and coconuts. In German money one pineapple costs only fifteen to twenty cents. A blessed land, this island of Ceylon. Yours, Annie Witting Gradually the trip comes to an end. The day before yesterday we were in Singapore. Tomorrow we will arrive in Manila, then Hong Kong, and Shanghai. From the experiences of this journey endless stories could be told. At the moment due to high waves my morning exercises are most interesting. All the best. Greetings to all. Adolf Josef Storfer In the years 1938 to 1941, nearly 20,000 Jews fled to Shanghai to escape the terror of the Nazis in Europe. Remnants of this exile were found in rare home movies, newsreels, secret documents, relief reports, and private and published writings by refugees. Judaism is Criminal. Read the special issue of the "St√ºrmer". To Dachau Jew Declaration from the Japanese Five Ministers Conference 1938. Our diplomatic ties with Germany and Italy require that we avoid embracing the Jewish people. But we should not reject them as they do because of our declared policy of racial equality. This is particularly true in light of our need for foreign capital and our desire not to alienate America. Notice from the National Christian Council of China, February, 1939. The persecuted Jews of Europe are pouring into Shanghai. Forty arrived on the Lloyd-Triestino steamer in July; another 40 in August; then 80 in September; and now each steamer brings them by the hundreds. At first, it was the professional men who came, doctors mostly, who, by a stroke of the pen were forbidden to practice their professions. Now it is the white-collar workers: grocers, cafe keepers, tailors, barbers, and young women who were secretaries, or corset-makers, or shop-workers. Most of them speak neither Chinese nor English. They land in Shanghai - a blind alley. Shanghai, May 21, 1939 Two years ago war broke out between the Japanese and Chinese in which the quarter of Hongkew was completely destroyed. The local residents, mostly Chinese, escaped into the other parts of the Settlement and into the French Concession. As emigration of the Jews grew more and more, and there were few possibilities for accommodating the refugees, the committee began to repair buildings in Hongkew in order to establish camps. Then some refugees began to buy and repair demolished houses themselves to start their own business and to hire out apartments Even though these Jews are mostly without means, an active life has begun. There are no problems from the Japanese who occupy this territory. The Europeans can freely come and go, but the Chinese only with specially issued passes from the Japanese. Otto Israel Gruber My dear, Since February 22 I have been in Shanghai, and feel wretched. The deplorable economic circumstances, and consequently the hopelessness of getting ajob, the difficulties to get away from here some day, and the dread of spreading diseases, these each in turn add to inexpressible despair and drive us, who had to go through inhuman hardships already, to a complete breakdown. The building where we are housed was a school formerly. There are 40 people in one room with 40 bunks. One washing basin for about 8-10 people Food is monotonous. There is also tea that is smelling of carbolic acid as the water has to be disinfected every other day. I hope you are well which is somewhat a consolation to me. I kiss you with all my love. Tobias Farb My dear friends, Shanghai has 4 million inhabitants, of which only 50,000 are Europeans. It is always wet, whether it is warm or cold. When it rains here one needs, by all means, high rubber boots because without them you cannot even walk on the street. Furthermore, the danger of epidemics is very great. And despite the fact that we were inoculated on the ship against cholera, pox, typhus and paratyphus, one must be inoculated here again, and every quarter year. We are in any case happy to be free people again with a heavy heart we left, and we never want to go back again. Yours, Annie Witting How can I make it possible for you to feel the specific atmosphere of this extraordinary city? The many smells, ranging all the way from the burnt incense in temples, to the carts in which human excrement was collected for fertilizer. The peculiar sounds and noises, emanating from the great variety of people, from the poorest coolies to the wealthiest men in the world, from the lives of socially accepted taxi dancers to the puritanistic British society ladies. Shanghai was a fake, a phony, neither occidental nor oriental. And yet - God forgive me she was the most exciting and unique city in the world. She was poison, and the old-time Shanghailanders were addicts who never could free themselves from being in love with her. Max Berges, refugee Emigrants have made unbelievable achievements. Out of ruins large buildings have sprung up and wonderful shops have opened. When you walk on Broadway here you think you are in Vienna or Berlin and forget that you are an immigrant. Many people have already built a nice existence and for some it definitely goes better than before. Refugee March 31, 1939 To Dr. Siegfried Bernfeld, San Francisco Dear Doctor The "Gelbe Post" is concerned with East Asian matters, but will take every opportunity to draw on psychoanalysis. In the first issue I have an article by a Japanese professor about psychoanalysis in Japan, and another by an English author, On the Psychoanalysis of Chinese Written Characters. The main thing is that I hurdle over the financially difficult beginning of my magazine. I work 15-16 hours a day and sleep 4-5 hours. But the worst is still to come the notorious Shanghai warm period, which will set in in a month. I remain yours with heartfelt greetings, A. J. Storfer. My dear friends, I have started several export businesses lingerie, pork bellies, etc. Furthermore I have sold unneeded crystal and I've bought American dollars. Then I also sold some sports coats for which I brought samples from Germany. The Chinese are very handy at copying and under the guidance of a European middle-man they came out very fine. The children are doing very well here. They attend a school in which instructions are only in English. The second richest man in Shanghai, Mr. Kadoorie, an Arabic Jew, established a club which is completely modeled on the English youth clubs. The children go to theater and concerts, take excursions. And all this is financed by this Mr. Kadoorie. He wants the emigrant children to lose the inferiority complex that has been partly caused by emigration. Yours, Annie Witting German General Consulate To the Foreign Office in Berlin Subject: Jews in Shanghai. From the recently arrived estimated 18,000 Jews, around 11,000 live in Hongkew, about 6,000 in the International Settlement, and the rest in the French Concession. Out of despair the Jewish girls are forced to go into the public hostess bars where they are trying to push out and undercut the Russian women who have dominated that field until now. Among the approximately 250 Jewish musicians, a number of them find employment in the city orchestra, as well as in hotels and nightclubs. In Hongkew the Jews have established an estimated 50-60 coffee houses and bars. Each morning we get up between 5:15 and 5:45 depending on our energy. By 7:00 papa must already be in the shop in order to carry the bread rolls with the boy. I stay home to put the room in order, and get the child ready for kindergarten. Then every morning I cook 30 to 35 meatballs that are sold for 10 cents each in the shop. Aside from groceries and fruit, we sell homemade pickled herrings, grilled foods, red beet salad, etc. At 9 o'clock, papa comes home. Then at last we eat. Finally socks are mended, laundry is ironed, and when we have time a letter is sometimes written. In any case, no evening do we go to bed before 11:30 and then we are of course dead tired. Our clientele are 85 percent immigrants. Most likely we will never learn Chinese because we have no opportunity to speak it. Pidgin-English by A. J. Storfer. In one of their public discussion evenings the YMCA recently presented an interesting topic. The speaker started with the premise that of the nearly four million Chinese people in the city, the greater part will never even try to learn English. On the other hand, neither the Englishmen nor Americans will learn the language of the natives. One should therefore make Pidgin English an obligatory school subject for foreigners and Chinese, and the Babylonian chaos of languages in Shanghai will be banished. Representatives of the teaching profession rejected the unreasonable demand to actively participate in the murder of the language of Shakespeare. In vain, the proposer explained, that even Shakespeare can be translated into Pidgin. And if one cannot comprehend the soliloquy To Be or Not to Be, one could still understand that Hamletian question in Pidgin: can do - no can do. Shanghai Jewish Chronicle Mars is the only spot in the universe where a Jewish emigrant can enter without a pass and an immigration visa. We heard this yesterday in a melancholic and amusing operetta which was performed at the Jewish Club. A Viennese dentist and his wife have a hard time adjusting to Shanghai, and are racking their brains to figure out where else to go. Then the emigrant falls asleep and dreams that he and his wife have landed on Mars. On Mars, at least in the dream, immigration, commerce, and love are free. The bitter irony of this piece unfortunately mirrors reality. Six million Jews in Central and Eastern Europe are still suffering with no prospects of ever finding refuge in this miserable world. Report of The Committee for the Assistance of European Jewish Refugees in Shanghai for the first six months of 1940: The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee's monthly allotment of $18,000 was reduced to $14,000 in April. The task of operating with considerably less funds was made vastly more difficult because of the rise in the cost of foodstuffs and coal from 50% to 150%. Six camps and two hospitals are operated. S'A. scofiJuneaboutt1,000)s people were a. ssistedlmonthly, As of June, about 11,000 people were assisted monthly, being given shelter, food and money. There is no future for refugees in China. Business has been disastrously affected by the wars. My dear friends, We have unfortunately suffered very much grief. That is, first I had a tropical dysentery for 6 weeks, and then my husband, especially heavy, for 14 weeks. And due to the dysentery, an inflammation of the heart muscle, which does not heal so quickly. Besides, he lost 40 pounds. Expenses from the sickness were enormous, and my greatest fear was: How do I make it? The first thought when I got up in the morning, and the last thought before going to sleep was: Making dollars) Sometimes I don't recognize myself. Was I ever so sober? Yours, Annie Witting July 1941 Dear Doctor Wittels, For one long year I have not let anyone hear from me, and postponed my writing more and more, hoping to finally have something favorable to report. It was in the middle of August that the $400 arrived by wire and I had every reason to see a rosy future. But I had not expected the unmerciful small-mindedness of my business competitors. Besides the two men who did night-duty felt compelled to suddenly report sick. I myself had to fill in at once, which had the outcome that right after the first night I suffered a severe heart attack. I was forced to liquidate the business within 8 days. I am completely cut off from friends in Europe. But I also never hear anything from America. However this is, in fact, my fault. Don't think too badly about your devoted Adolf Josef Storfer January 17, 1942 Subject: Emergency Measures for Jewish People. From: Japanese Foreign Minister Togo. Since Germany has deprived the Jewish people overseas of their nationality, German Jews will hereafter be treated as denationalized Jews. Those who can be made use of on our part will be treated in a friendly way. The rest of them will be placed under strict surveillance so that any hostile activity may be eliminated or suppressed. February 18, 1943 The lmperial Japanese Army and Navy authorities, in ajoint proclamation issued today, announced the restriction of residences and places of business of stateless refugees in Shanghai to a designated area as from May 18. By "stateless refugees" are meant those European refugees who have arrived in Shanghai since January 1, 1937. Geneva, June 15, 1943 From The International Committee of the Red Cross: With reference to the situation of the civilian population in Shanghai, the worst distress exists undoubtedly amongst the German-Jewish immigrants, of whom at least 6,000 are on the point of starvation and about 9,000 more are not far better off. For the moment the Jewish Committee has still some of the 3,000 bags of flour left which was donated last July, but even that will be exhausted by the end of next month. The fact that during the recent first cold spell 534 dead bodies were picked up in the streets after one night may give you an indication of the extent of the misery which prevails amongst the poorer classes of the Chinese population. Shanghai Journal, January 20, 1946 Adolf Josef Storfer Shanghai has not yet forgotten him. In May 1939 he came out with the "Gelbe Post" and won, with one stroke, everyone for him, who in that time of dying culture, was seeking the sun of spiritual cheer, the shimmer of the sharpened word, the warmth of a deep soul. One week before the outbreak of the Pacific War he traveled away. Now we come to learn of his early death. For me the passing of Storfer means the loss of an old friend. I came to know him in the year 1920 at the Viennese Cafe Central, at that time the literary cafe. We sailed together to Shanghai after he lived for 2 months in my Viennese room. Brother, how do you like it on the other side? Do you have a room with a desk and a table lamp reserved for me? My dear friends, In these times we went through the hardest years of our lives, which despite everything, I would not have wanted to miss. As international and interesting as life has been in China, it will be nowhere in the world again. By that, I mean life before the outbreak of the American-Japanese war, especially the business life. Now the wildest inflation in the country rules, along with a certain hatred of foreigners. China is ready for Communism and I fear very much that they will win the upper hand. The educated Chinese regret that everything has come to this point. The foreigners are, for the most part, leaving their country and the Chinese know exactly how much they need them for business. We thought when we came to China that we could teach business skills to the Chinese, but in reality we have learned from them. Yours, Annie Witting May 1947 All my dear friends, Is this all a dream or indeed reality? For four days we have been underway on the high sea, withdrawing more and more from China, heading for our new home, Australia. Around us the endless sea. We see flying fish and sometimes even sharks. The sea is steel blue, the top of the waves shine brilliantly. One comes to feel again like a human being, and no longer a refugee. Yours, Annie Witting When the Communists took over Shanghai in 1949, the vast majority of refugees had emigrated to the United States, Australia, Canada and the newly founded State of Israel. Some returned to Europe, partly due to immigration restrictions that prevented them from going elsewhere.
