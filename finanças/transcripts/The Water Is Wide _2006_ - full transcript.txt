Captioning sponsored by CBS Back in the days when I was young and a little too sure of myself, Yamacraw Island was a remote and isolated corner of America-- forgotten by history, untouched by the hand of modern man. Across the water and a world away, the school board of Beaumont County, South Carolina, was in command of the island's education. It was here, on the mainland, that I first learned of Yamacraw and its children. Fearless and capable, Dr. Henry Piedmont, the superintendent of schools in Beaumont County, was a mill town kid who had scratched his way to the top and never looked back. We first met in the summer of 1969. Although I'd graduated from a military academy, I had elected to join the Peace Corps, but when that option suddenly fell through... So, you've turned to teaching? Well, I'm already a teacher, sir. You were a teacher-- high school, two years, where you were relieved of your duties as a basketball coach? Yeah, well, I guess I favored the better players, who happened to be black. Son, they tell me I run the most democratic school system in the country. That little gesture he just made... kind of reminded you of me, didn't it, son? How dare you use that tone with a superior officer?! No wonder you're not a marine! You don't have it in you! Turned out to be a nothing-- a smart-mouthed nobody without a job! Your father was in the military, that right? Yes, sir. United States Marine Corps, sir. Then you are familiar with the concept of chain of command? Yes, I am, sir. Mr. Conroy, do you know why you came here today? Well, I want to teach at "Yamercraw," sir. Yam-a-craw. The "A" is soft. Yamacraw. Yamacraw. In any event, that's not the reason. That's not the real reason. Would you care to know? You mean the real real reason. Divine guidance. "Divine guidance." Mr. Conroy, you're too young and you're too naive to realize this now, but I believe that is the real reason you came to me today. You see, son, I've been praying for an answer to the problems that confront Yamacraw. It's worried me sick, boy. Where was I going to find somebody who was willing to live and work among those islanders, somebody who could dedicate himself to the education of those beautiful, beautiful, children? Live among them, sir? I'm not sure... ! I want you to go there. I want you to move around, have a look-see, and I want you to tell me what you think. Will you do that for me? My appointed navigator was Zeke Skimberry, a local fisherman who'd spent his life on the river. He could judge her moods and read her signs better than any man in the region. Thanks for the ride, Mr. Skimberry. Pat Conroy. Welcome. Ida, this here's Pat Conroy. Hey, Luther, you got any 25s? And bring me a Spanish if you got it. Mr. Conroy. Wife, Ida. That's queen trigger. Ever seen one of them? Nope. Best eating fish in the sea. Good catch. For many years, Ezra Bennington had been in charge of the school district that included Yamacraw Island. Yeah, thank you, Zeke. Well, Mr. Conroy. It is a great pleasure to meet you. Well, it's good to meet you, sir. And you, sir, are going to love Yamacraw. I expect I will. When Bennington's domain was absorbed by Beaumont County, Piedmont had made him deputy superintendent-- a lofty title for a position that amounted to little more than local errand boy. There was a time when the Yamacraw oysters were world famous. Yeah? Yeah. What happened? Well, you know, perils of modern days, and, you know, most folks moving off, and the ones left behind, well, they're just living off what the island provides. Still kind of primitive then, Well, I helped put in electricity a few years back, for the sake of the children. Lord knows I've worked to get those kids educated. I love them as my own, actually. Am I right about that, Zeke? Yes, sir, Mr. Bennington. That no preacher man. That the new teacher. New teacher coming. We going to be late! I don't care about no teacher man. What if I commute-- if I had my own boat? No. You'd never be able to navigate these waters. I'm sure I could learn. No, no, Zeke's got the only boat comes out here. He's the only man that can get us through all of this stuff here. How about the kids-- don't they ever get off the island? Yeah, yeah. They have to cross over to the mainland eventually. I mean, there's no work on Yamacraw. Mr. Conroy, Yamacraw's just one big, old alligator I've been wrestling with just for years and years and years. Mrs. Brown was the first decent teacher that I could get to live here full time. Shh. Come on; join the chain gang. You all will pay attention and follow my instructions, do you understand? Yes, ma'am. The only white folks on the island were Ted Stone and his wife. Somehow, being a decorated veteran of World War II qualified Ted to be chief of police, fire marshal and game warden. Ted, this is Pat Conroy. Come to look at our school. Mr. Stone. He also delivered the mail for his wife, Lou-- the official postmistress, who was a mechanic at heart and drove the Yamacraw school bus. Lou. Pat Conroy here. Good morning, ma'am. I understand y'all are the folks to know around here. That a fact? Y'all live here long, Mr. Stone? Long enough. Whoa. Hey, there. Hi, y'all. Show me the flower. Baby, that's a rabbit. Show me the flower. Y'all sit up straight. Mind your manners. Yes, ma'am. Don't act your color. Whoa. Some driving, Ted. Got you here, didn't I? Yeah, barely. Mr. Bennington, what an honor it is to have you visit with us, sir. Could this possibly be our new addition? Teacher man, teacher man! Well, if he accepts our offer, which I am certain that he will once he gets to know you, Mrs. Brown. Mr. Conroy. Welcome overseas, Mr. Conroy. Thank you very much. And you can just call me Pat. Things are rough overseas, Mr. Conroy. Missionary work is what this is. Mr. Bennington's the only one who understands. Well... Children, say good morning to Mr. Bennington. Good morning, Mr. Bennington. And to Mr. Conroy. Good morning, Mr. Con... Roy. Roy. You know, I used to go to a school just like this one. That's the truth. Yeah, one room. Pot belly in the corner, right over there. And look where I got? Now, you itty-bits, now, you listen hard to Mrs. Brown and hopefully Mr. Conroy, and you work even harder? Well, you're all going to get to be big and important, just like me? Now, y'all going to do that? Yes, sir. Turn around. Bless you, Esther. I knew you could bring the little ones up. I try, Mr. Bennington. I do try. Barbara and I met six months after her husband died. Mommy, that man's here again. She believed in the contented home, a happy family, admired order and used a napkin. I used the back of my hand and thrived on chaos, but we fell in love anyway, and planned to be married later that fall. He shoots! So, did you get it? Get what? Don't be a dork, Conroy. Yeah, quit being a dork. You quit being a dork, Well, you're looking at the number two educator at Yamacraw Island. Way to go, Conroy. Very cool. Night-night, sweetie pie. I got to split. What's that-- fifth grade lesson plan? It's just as hard as high school, maybe harder-- you'll see. Are you trying to tell me I can't get by on my winning Conroy charm? I just don't understand why you can't commute. It's not that far across the river. Well, they want me to be sort of a presence. Anyway, they tell me there's no boat. Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Do they know you're getting married in two months? What about after that? I... That's crazy. Seriously. Tell me about it; I know. In case you don't remember, there's a little girl up there that still calls you "that man." She needs her daddy-- who's going to be you, by the way. I know, I know. I'll get on their case. I had to get the job first, right? Hang on, hang on. One teacher to another. Wow. I love you. Really, you should check it out. Check it out. It saved me more than once. I mean, I'm not kidding. Here, let me help you. Hey, good luck to you, Mr. Conroy. Thanks, Mrs. Skimberry. It's Ida. Thanks, Ida. Do you ever see any boats for sale around Bluffton? Now and then. I just need a little one. How little? Enough to get me to Yamacraw and back. - Mr. Bennington says... - Well, let's forget what Mr. Bennington says. I need my own boat. Thanks, Mr. Stone. Appreciate it. You know, a lot of gals ain't got hair as long as you. Have you ever taught colored children before, Mr. Conroy? Well, for two years, I was... At the elementary level? No, I haven't. You're going to have the older grades: five through eight. Now, treat 'em stern. Be tough. Keep 'em hard at the work, or they'll run you right out the door. Mrs. Brown, I think... You'll be in here. This is great. Y'all get out. Come on. Ain't got all day. Let's go. I know colored people better than you do. Thank you to monitor that door, Ethel. I am one myself, in case you hadn't noticed. That is why I know you have to step on 'em. Step on 'em every day and keep stepping on 'em. If you have any trouble, "Professor Medicine" is right next door. In your seats. Eyes ahead. Close your mouths. Yo, give me that ball. Give me that ball. - Come here. Give it here. - All right, all right. Break it up. Settle down, everybody. Good morning, my young geniuses of Yamacraw. Are you all ready to learn today? Well, you're going to be. And you know what we're going to start with? We're going to start with my name: Mr. Conroy. Can you say it? Let's hear it. Con...roy? Con-o-roy. Conroy. Hey, hold on, hold on. Um... we'll break it up in two parts. Mr. Con...roy. Mr. Con...roy. Mr. Con...roy. Mr. Conroy. Most of them have slow brains. But you all can learn if you work... if you stop being such lazy, lazy people. Now, I know some of you in here were born simple-minded. And you know who you are. And we know that you can't help being that way. That just means you got to work even harder than your lazy, lazy friends. Simple-minded people have to be pushed and whipped harder than anybody. Everybody, start shaking. Everybody, shake loose? Fingertips down to your toes. Shake your hips. Everything! We're going to dust the cobwebs off those smart little brains. Okay. Have a seat. Very good. Don't you all feel awake now? No. All right, you see those papers and pencils in front of you there? I want to know everything about you all. I want to know what you like, and what you don't like, and what makes you tick. Tick? No, trust me now. Okay. So for the next 20 minutes, I want you to write down everything about yourselves. Okay? Ready, set, go. Seriously, grab your pencils, grab your pencils. Everybody, grab your pencils. Everybody. And just start writing down everything. All about yourselves. I want... Don't sweat the grammar, the spelling, any of that nonsense. Just get to writing. Write it down. Everything. Don't worry about a thing. What's your name, son? Prophet. Ethel. Charles. I'm cool like ice. Mary. Oscar, sir. Cindy Lou. Frank. Lincoln. Lincoln, what country do we live in? What's the name of this grand old red, white and blue nation of ours? Land of the free, home of the brave? Place you all were born? Come on, gang, somebody must know what country we live in. No. Am... merica? America. Does that ring a bell? No. No? No one here has ever heard of the United States of America? Yeah. I heared it in "I pledge a legent." Yes. Pledge of Allegiance. Very good, Ethel. Thank you, sir. Excu... excuse me. Excuse me. Young man? Yes, sir? What's your name? Saul, sir. Saul, do you know who the first president of the United States was? George Washington. Right on, Saul. That's very good. Just imagine how well you'd do if you paid a little more attention in here. Shut up. Now, okay, okay, okay, okay, hey. Hey, now that we're on a roll... Everybody, now that we're on a roll, I want someone to tell me the name of that big old ocean that washes up on the far side of Yamacraw. That big old body of water. Body? I ain't seen no body. That's very good, Charles. Thank you. No, but what I mean is... I mean the body of water. No? Okay. Okay. Now... this is the mainland right here. And you all live on an island. You know that, right? You know that you live on an island? Yeah. Okay, good. Now, this is the mainland. This is the island. This... here is the river. Now, it's pretty wide, but you can still see the land on the other side. And then all of this over here... is what you call an ocean because it's so big that you can't see any land on the other side. And the name of this ocean is...? All right. The Atlantic. A-T-L-A-N-T-I-C. Atlantic. So, for $64 million, who can tell me the name of that big old body of water that washes up on the far side of Yamacraw? Atlantic. All right. Atlantic. Now, everybody, everybody. Atlantic. Very good. Hey, kids! Get Saul. Come on. My pre-Yamacraw theory of teaching was pretty basic. I figured a good teacher had to show a bit of insanity, or at least look as if he was out of control, if he wanted to catch and hold the attention of his students. I'm George Washington, and-and I'm the leader of the Continental Army, and I'm going to whoop you. Well, you people can't beat the British Army. The greatest army in the whole world. Yeah? That's cheating. I wasn't ready. Welcome to America, Mr. King. All right, so this is a set shot, okay? Gonna have your knees bent, and when you get your arm up, you want this to make an "L." All right? And you go up... and you make it. All right, Lincoln, bring it back here. All right. Now, you guys all get a turn, all right, but, Lincoln, you go first. Get it, get it! What is that that they're speaking? Awful gibberish, isn't it? Lord knows I have tried to beat it out of 'em. What I mean is, what language is it? Gullah dialect. Goes all the way back to the slavery days. Leftover from Africa. Slow, slow. Young men, the young ladies needed to go first. You stand up. Prophet? You and I are outsiders on Yamacraw. You better get used to it. Come on. Stand up straight. Come on, boy. Hi there. What you want? I thought I'd introduce myself. I know who you is, teacher man. My name's Conroy. Pat Conroy. No matter what your name. What you teach-- that what matter. You do right with my grands, or I'm gonna have to get Old Betsy out the house and drop you down. Well, that's why I'm here, ma'am. I'm going to do my best... 'Fore you come, they sent old Miss Glover out to pasture. For 40 years, that's all she say: "Do my best." She never teach nobody 'round here nothin' except "Yes, sir" and "No, sir." Well, I'm going to change all that, ma'am, but I can't do it alone. I need some support. I want to get the parents involved. Finally, I started to get the picture. I was a foreigner in Yamacraw the same way the children were foreigners in America. The parents knew firsthand that sitting in that schoolhouse led nowhere, and they'd passed their failed dreams along to their kids. That's right. Then we'll just slide 'em into like a little semicircle. Okay. All right, gang, all right. Okay, have seat, have a seat. Okay, okay. What I figure is if we're gonna spend a whole year together, we better get to know each other. So we're gonna spend the day today-- the entire day-- just talking. About what we talkin', teacher man? - Yeah. - What we talking about? Yeah, what are we talking about? Well, we're gonna talk about what you like, what you don't like, what turns your crank, you know, anything that you want really. Sir, we don't know about no crank. - Yeah. No, no, no, no, no. What I mean is... You know what? Um, how about we just start? Yeah, we can start. Okay. Let's start. Okay. I guess I'll go first, right? Yeah. Guess so. Yeah. Okay. Well, I was born poor, white and ugly. He got that right. He's ugly. But see, I've grown up. I'm still poor, I'm still white. And you're still ugly. - All right. - Okay. So, let's see. I've got four brothers... I told them about my mother, and how she loved books, and how my father flew jets, and my four brothers and two sisters, about how much I loved basketball, and that I was getting married to Barbara, who had a daughter named Jennie, and how her husband died, and all about our little yellow car that looked like a bug and was made in a country called Germany on the other side of the... 'Lantic! Good. Then Cindy Lou told me all about 'scrinching' squirrels. You just scrinch the squirrel. You just stuck it right on the stuck and then put it over the hot fire, and then the fur-- all of a sudden, it scrinch right up, and then you just brush it off, or else if just want to fry it, you just slit up the belly, and then peels the skin back so it's all smooth, just like a grape. Yuck! It's so good. ...You don't even know what you talkin' about. Hey, Teacher Man. Mr. Conroy, you ever seen a snake milk a cow? No, that's bull. Snake can't milk no bull, man. Well, can't milk no cow, neither. Hey, I seen it. Me... Me, too. It wicked! Has anybody else in here witnessed this bovine phenomenon? I seen it. You know, one time, I seen one so big, he milk a cow dry. Yup. That's right. - You swear? - Yes, ma'am. Hey, Ethel. Ethel, come on. What's the truth? Yeah, Ethel. Yeah, tell him the truth. Come on, Ethel, come on. Tell him the truth, Ethel. Tell him. Yes sir, Mr. Conroy, it true all right. I seen plenty a snake milk cows. And do they take that milk and put it in bottles and then sell it at the store? Man. No! They suck it right up! Man, here come the news. Have you heard the story about the snake...? You are going to lose the respect of those children. I don't... Your approach... Can't they have a little fun, too? I have already told you about colored children. They need whippin'. They understand whippin'. Believe me. Well... ma'am, I can understand your point of view... Okay. That's good. These are your textbooks. Textbooks? No. The state requires the students to read these books. Mrs. Brown, I'm-I'm not sure if you are aware of this, but those kids don't know what country that they live in. They can't recite the alphabet, they can't spell their own name, they can't add two and two, and you expect them to read from these books. That's beside the point. The state requires them to read the books. Mrs. Brown, what if they can't? Mr. Conroy, your job is to make them. Excuse me, Mrs. Stone. Hi. There's a sign up the road, says there, a library's this way? Ain't open. But there is one? 'Course. Well, could you tell me the hours, and then maybe I'll come...? You want a book? No, I just wanted... Libraries are for books. Now, you want a book, I'll open it up. You want to just look, I ain't got time. So you mean that you're the li...? Ted really hates Nazis. You get tax money back for givin' away things to education. So, I got Ted to donate his entire collection. Not that any of them younguns ever come in here and read 'em. You know, I don't think those kids know too much about war. Well, I say, a book's a book. How you gettin' along with Miss Brown? Okay. Not bad. Ask me, that woman's a savior. Least she teaches them ragamuffins some manners, how to show respect. Yeah, she does that, all right. Honey, them doors ain't been open in I don't know how long. Whoa! What is all this?! Come last year from the state. I was gonna send it all back, but, heck, it was free. Well, thanks to you, Yamacraw Island has just entered the audiovisual age. All right, everybody knows who this is, right? Saul, we talked about him. Who that be? He was the head of the Continental Army. Who is that? George Washington, George Washington. Who that? By looking at her crown, you can tell she's royalty. Who is that? Who's she? That's Queen Elizabeth. Have you ever heard of Napoleon? Desi Arnaz, Lucille Ball? This is our 16th president. We talked about this man just recently. He's our president right now, 1969. Man, who that? Richard Nixon. All right, greatest baseball player in the Major Leagues. Center fielder for the Giants? No one? That was Willie Mays. Come. Go ahead. Slow. I know. I think rehab. Re-Reverb. Yeah, maybe... What's in front? Right here! Right here! Number one, number one, right there. Right there. Right there. Yeah. It's working. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Miss Brown, let me handle this one. Why should I? Well, because you know what? Because you... Why should I, Conroy? 'Cause you are right. You are so incredibly absolutely right! I'm-I'm gonna go in there, I'm gonna take charge of these kids, I'm gonna kick a few rear ends, I'm gonna show 'em who's boss. I'm gonna take charge. Charles. Charles... Charles... What is that? What are you doing there? Soul, sir. Is that what you call that? You call that soul? Yes, sir. Well, I got to tell you, Charles, you're one groovy dude. What's that-- groovy? Groovy? Well, it means you're cool, man. Cool. Cool. Cool, Charles. Yeah, what do you think? Yeah, what do you think, our man Charles pretty cool? Who else wants to give it a try? Get out, get out... Yeah, Oscar. Yeah, yeah, yeah! Let it shine! Whoo! Go, Frank, go. Go, Frank. Whoo! Go, Frank! All the rest of that day, the children, whose physical lives were ruled by a river, showed me how their imaginations knew no bounds. My, man. Ooh, fresh baked pie. Excuse me. Look, singing and carrying on like that is a waste of time. If you do not follow the curriculum, I'm gonna have to report you. Report me? As Principal of the school, the proper education of these children is my responsibility. Well, that's a relief. I thought I was gonna have to do it. Do what? To report that somehow, the educational process here, that most kids in this school, by the time they get to the senior grades, are completely illiterate. That's not my doing. Does Piedmont know? I expect so. But then, it is not your job to tell him. And why is that? Chain of command. Chain of command? That's the rule. Yeah, the rule. I got to tell you, Mrs. Brown, me and rules-- we don't get along too well. Mr. Conroy, "rules and I." Rules and I. I knew that. - Sir! Sir! - Dr. Piedmont. Hold on, sir! You can't be trespassing. Do you know this man, Dr. Piedmont? Mr. Conroy. Pleasure. Real sorry to bother you on a Saturday. Sam? Don't mind them. They're kind of fussy about the protocol and the dress code around here. So, tell me about Yamacraw. Things going all right? No, sir, it's not all right at all. The... I think there's something I want to tell you about the island. I'm all ears, boy. While at Columbia University, Piedmont had studied books on administrative procedure. Every thesis he read stressed how the successful superintendent demanded strict adherence to the... Chain of command, boy. You told me you understood the concept. I do, sir. I do, but I thought that you'd want to know about... You know, you were a godsend to me. Yeah, you mentioned that... Day and night, I prayed for an answer to the conundrum of Yamacraw, and then you come here to my doorway out of the blue. A miracle. Yes, sir, but now that I've been there... Yeah, now that you've been there, you want to let me down. No, that's not it at all... Of course it's none of my business, and maybe this is a matter between you and your conscience, but I do not understand how you can disappoint those little children. No... Now, listen to me, boy. It's a gift to listen. Don't you know you're their salvation? You're their hope. And I want to tell you something else, though I believe you're too young and you're too naive to understand this, but from the bottom of my heart, I know that Yamacraw is your divine calling. You stay strong, boy. Stay strong. Take the wheel. You can't take your own boat out here if you don't know the water. Really? Hold her due east. More than simply pointing out the underwater hazards, Zeke guided my path toward an awareness of the ebb and flow of the tides. And then he directed my attention to the coming of the sun as it awakened the horizon with the vibrant color that inspired poets and foretold the weather. That tune came from the 50 Greatest All-Time Classical Hits. You're excited. I can see that. Okay, now, this... this next number is coming by this long-haired cat named Beethoven. Okay, now, what's his name? Bay...toven. Thoven, you got it. All right, good. That's right. Now, this guy wrote some pretty heavy tunes. He came from Germany. This is Germany. It's on the continent of Europe. Now, what's the name of that continent? Europe. You-rope. All right, you guys are hip. You're getting it. Okay, now, this song by Beethoven was one of his most famous songs. It's all about how death was this ghost, and it was coming to his house and it started knocking on his door. Now, Beethoven-- he got to thinking: if something this heavy was going to come and knock on his door, Okay, everybody... Okay. Is everybody ready? Want to hear the death ghost? Yeah! I'm ready for that ghost. Can you hear him knocking? I can! You guys are sharp. You're sharp. All right, how about this one? Take a listen to this. You know, but if you listen, if you listen, this song is like what a mama might sing when she wants her baby to go to sleep. Do y'all want to know a secret? Yeah, tell us a secret. Tell us, tell us. You guys learn... as good and as fast as anyone I've known my whole life. Really? We smart. Yeah, you are smart. You are. You know what? From now on, you guys are going to become the most advanced scholars on classical music out of any school in all of Beaumont County. How does that sound? Right! How does that sound? Is that right? Yeah, yeah. And we're going to test those brains right now-- we're going to test. All right, your first test. Beethoven! - Very good, you guys. - That's good. I can't believe this. Just a while ago, it was way off, and now it's two weeks away. 13 days. Amazing. Hey. What do you think, too fussy? Maybe not orchids. Hello? Anyone home? I'm sorry, babe, I just... You know, I got to get these kids off the island, break their cycle. Here you go, sweetie. I got to get 'em... you know, I got to connect them to the world. Otherwise, they're going to get eaten alive by people even less enlightened than Piedmont and Bennington. But you can't because...? Because the number one educator on Yamacraw-- she's a case. Well, maybe the old Conroy style isn't the best approach. This woman... she is... she is so... Scared is what she is. A professional black woman trying to make it in the white male South. And then you come in-- Mr. Loose Cannon-- with your big plans and your big attitude. Attitude? Me? Yeah, you, Conroy. Just be the you I fell in love with, and you'll be fine. All right, gang, I'm going to tell you about my great-great-granddaddy, El Ferdinand de Burrito el Castio Conroy. Now, see, he's a world-famous explorer He's crazy. 'cause he's the first man to swim from Spain all the way to North America. - You lie. - No, no. And from that day forward, they called this the Conroy Ocean. You lie, Teacher Man. Well, how do you know? Because it ain't no Conroy Ocean. You said it called Atlantic. Look on the globe. Yeah. I'm busted. You're right. But see, now you know that you don't have to believe something just 'cause I say it's true. See, we live in a free country, and what that means is we're free to disagree with what anyone says-- even the teacher. Give me that! Hey, Prophet, Oscar, hey. Just leave it on the floor, okay? See, there was a great American, and his name was Ralph Waldo Emerson. And he believed we must always question rules and laws and not believe a thing's true just because the big cheese say so. All right, you know what? You all look a little tired, so let's take a nap. Everybody, put your head down, close your eyes, take a little nap. And when I count to three, I want all you to pop up, open your eyes, and be wide awake, okay? One... two... three. You don't always hear what I'm saying, do you, Saul? He can't hear! Gang, hey. All right, guys, break it up. Twelve. How's he do that?! He's saying that... Hey, gang, Saul reads lips. You're reading my lips right now without even thinking about it. So from now on, when you guys talk to Saul, I want you to face him, and I want you to articulate your words. That way, he can see the shape of your mouth, and then he can understand. All right? Are you all going to do that for me? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, turn around. All right, everybody, tell Saul you're going to help him out. Yes! - We're sorry, Saul. - I'll help you, Saul. Good to see you. What you got, I don't want none of it. I've come about Saul. Saul? My little grand? He in trouble? Far from it, Mrs. Graves. He's the brightest student in class. Shh. Shh, shh. So what you sayin'? I'm saying he's almost deaf. He's been keeping it a secret. Been that way since he was born. Well, the other children, they won't be teasing him anymore. Just thought you'd want to know. So long. Hey, gang, gang, hey. I'll bet you didn't know it, but this old oak-- this is the original Tree of Knowledge. Aw, man, you crazy. It is. It is. This tree knows everything, and I can prove it. That tree didn't go to school. He don't know nothin'. You see, what I'm going to do is I'm going to ask you some hard questions, and you won't be able to get any of the answers right. Aw, man... But this old tree... How is the tree going to know it? It's going to help you. How? It's going to whisper that knowledge into your ears. This tree is so smart, that knowledge oozes out of the branches. I don't see no knowledge in the branches. Y'all ready? No. Come on. What is the longest stinking river in the whole wide world? - Nile. - Good. And what continent is it in? Africa. Do I come from Africa? - No! - No! You from Ireland. Well, Ireland is a country in Africa. - No, it's not. - You lie. What is the largest desert in the world? Sahara. Mr. Conroy! Man, here comes the news. This school is here for education, not for all-day recess. The State says if you are on school property, you have to abide by the rules. Y'all get your little narrow hineys out of the tree. Hold on, hold on. We're still in class. We're still in class. Class gonna get us in trouble. Mrs. Brown, you're right. Heck, the whole state's right. Come on. Now, hold on, hold on. But there is one thing we can do. Y'all ever hear of a field trip? Yeah. You want to take one? Yeah! Well, all right. Let's go have one. Come on. Wait a minute! Wait! Get back... get back here! Conroy! What's the nearest star? The sun! Saul, watch my lips. What's the closest planet to the sun? Mercury! What's the biggest country in the world? China! I live in China. No! You lie! Who saw the death ghost? Beethoven! Beethoven's from Yamacraw! Germany! Who else is from Germany? Bach! Bach played the banjo? No! No? Afternoon. Mrs. Brown had been educated in a private school where she learned the importance of what she called "the fundamentals of refinement." Mr. Conroy. Hello, Mrs. Brown. I sure do appreciate this invitation. We'll see about that. I believe in education. Without it, these children haven't a chance. Exactly. That's exactly my position. I just don't think that harsh discipline is the answer. You cannot control those children without a strap. Well... you see, I think... Yes, I do see, Mr. Conroy. I do. Well, then you must also see how important it is that these children get off the island, and I got a great idea how to do that. Well, whatever it is, I cannot allow it. They need fundamentals, not field trips. Why can't you understand that? They also need to see how the world works. This is good pie, by the way. Mr. Conroy, you were not hired to show them how the world works. Excuse me for being blunt-- I am not at all sure you know how it works. All her refinement couldn't hide the fact that she was obstinate and immovable. Might take me a couple of days to get her fixed up. You know, Zeke... She's all yours. Seriously? Yeah. Thank you....! Thank you! Ooh... come here, sweetie. Okay, let's have it. What's going on? What do you mean, what's going on? What do you think, pip-squeak, you think something's going on? Mom, is he being a dork? Well, I got, I got some good news and some very interesting news. Good first. Zeke loaned me a boat. Okay, good so far. And the really, really interesting news is that... I invited 12 Yamacraw kids to the wedding. I got to say, Conroy, you're starting to grow on me. Ain't going. What do you mean? Not going no place. Staying. Our grandma just laughed. She laughed? She laugh real hard. She think you joking us. So, nobody got permission? No, sir. Our grandma say no way. Want to come, but can't. Yeah. No means no. Why won't you allow these kids to go? I'll tell you why. I know that river. I lost three family in that river. They sink down like quarry rocks. When they come up, they's all swelled up like toadyfish. I been living on Yamacraw all these many years, and I ain't gon' lose no grands to that river. Nothing is going to happen to them. I'll protect them with my life. You young. You don't know that river. That river can eat a man. I got Zeke Skimberry's boat, and there ain't a man around who knows the river better than Zeke. Why you want my little ones at your big, fancy white wedding, anyhow? Because these kids need as much mainland experience as they can get before they cross over. And besides, I think they're going to have fun. You know, I-I know they're going to have fun. Fun? Well, I just bet you know something about that. Miz Brown never come visit me one time-- not about Saul, not about nothing. Old lady Glover, she never come neither, but that's on account of she figured I'd fetch Old Betsy out of the house and chase her off. Mrs. Graves... I'm going to take care of your grandchildren. I give you my word. Wow! Hey, look at the... It huge! Look at that building. I don't believe it. I don't... All right, everybody sit down. Everybody, take off your coats, okay? Saul, take off your coat. Mr. Conroy! Mr. Conroy, I got a question... All right, shh, shh, shh. ...I got a question. Hey, sit down. Prophet, sit down. Lincoln, sit down. All right, I need everybody quiet, okay? In a second, the prettiest girl in the world's gonna be walking down here, okay? And I want you to be good. You guys look great. You look beautiful today, baby. What's your name? Ethel. My name's Jennie. You dat Jennie. How come you here? Man! He's my new daddy. Teacher Man, Teacher Man... Teacher Man her daddy? Guys, go ahead. I do. Do you, Barbara, take Pat to have and to hold from this day forward, in sickness and in health, in prosperity and adversity, for as long as you both shall live? I do. By the laws vested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. Good morning, Mr. Stone. I'm a little late for school. I thought maybe you could give me a ride. You a Nazi? No. Heard you drive one of them little Nazi cars. No... I killed a bunch of Nazis. I'd kill more if I could. Give me a word that starts with D. Ooh. Door, day, devil. Duh. All right, it's Prophet's turn again. Go ahead, buddy. Dog. Dog, yeah. That's a good one. Now go ahead and spell it. D...O... D. Man. Prophet, you stupid. - No, no. Okay, go on and sit down. I repeat, do not write in these textbooks. I'm gonna talk to Mr. Conroy. Mrs. Brown... do... do you not like these people? Do you have something against them? You are talking crazy. You know, hitting them the way that you do does not make them smarter. It doesn't encourage them to learn. If anything, it makes them fear school, and it probably even makes them avoid and ignore everything you're trying to teach them. You don't know what you're talking about. Maybe not. Maybe I'm just guessing. But one thing I do know is that you don't listen. Is that what you think? You don't control those children, you can't teach them. What you do is entertain them. See, they get rowdy, and you say, "All right, gang, "break it up, break it up. Enough's enough." I hear you. I hear you all day long, Pat Conroy. Basketball training had given me a sense for the opposition's strategy. And I was started to get a feeling, Mrs. Brown might have put a defensive play in motion when it suddenly revealed itself. Inside, Mr. Conroy. Mr. Bennington. What a surprise. Always a pleasure to see you, Esther. Your recent tardiness, Mr. Conroy, has been duly noted. Then there's the matter of this-this gas bill that you submitted for reimbursement. I'm sure you don't expect our schools to pay for the gas that you use to get to work. Yeah, I do. But we don't pay for the other teachers to get to work. Well, how many of them take boats? Our county has no commuting allowance. Now, you were aware of that when we hired you on staff. Since then I got married. We'll pay for your gas on Monday and Friday. Any other boat trips are considered recreational, which we expect you to bear the expense. Let me get this straight. So you think marriage is recreational, and being a responsible father-- now that's a sport? That's not the point, Mr. Conroy. It sure as heck is the point. That's exactly the point. Conroy, please, do not fly off the handle. Mrs. Brown, do you think I'm flying off the handle? I mean, as the principal of this school, you must have an opinion on my situation. No, Mrs. Brown has nothing to do with it. Colleague to colleague, you think this is fair? It's Piedmont who's behind this, right? Yamacraw is my jurisdiction. Yeah, right, sure it is. Yeah, I am responsible for your position here! Okay. Yeah, well, guy's got to do what a guy's got to do. You can't just walk away! Where do you think you're going? Well, see, I was told to follow a chain of command, not to stop on the weakest link. How dare you. Now you take one more step, and I swear, I'll... You'll what? What, you're gonna fire me? Do you really think you have the authority to do that? It's late. I'm going home. Hold on, Conroy! Perhaps... we can work something out here. Democracy. Got to love it. T minus ten... nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Lift off! Yeah! Lift off. Right. Come on, let's hear it for the scientists, and for Gordon, and for Conrad, and for Bean? How about that, gang? There they go. Three brave astronauts have just gone to the moon! They're not going to the moon. What...? Well, yeah. Frank, you just heard 'em blast off. Mr. Conroy, ain't goin' to no moon. Well, gang, how...? Who else here doesn't think the Apollo's going to the moon? I don't think they're going to moon, Mr. Conroy. No, they're not going to... Moon too far. And, Ethel, you, too? You say it good we question authority. Well, yeah, but I didn't mean me. How are these kids ever gonna make it on the mainland if they don't think man walked on the moon? I know plenty of places in this country where they'd be right at home. Well, darling, that's the point of education, right? That they don't end up in those places. Man, if they could ever see the real thing. Well, take 'em to DC. Yeah, right. Mrs. Brown would be totally into that. Here come American's number one college basketball team, the Harlem Globetrotters with their legendary pregame warm-up. These fine athletes display their mastery of basketball technique in every game, but nowhere more enjoyably than during these moments before the first period. There's Meadowlark Lemon bounce-passing to the clown prince Hubert Geese Ausbie. Way to go, Geese! And it's around the back, through the legs, and over the top to Curly Neal, who quickly dunked it off to Bobby Joe Mason. a big right hook from Frank "The Hooker." My ankle. My ankle. Lincoln "The Dirty" Who you calling dirty! Over here. Goes out to Oscar "The Spinner." Stolen by "Saul The Small!" Good shot! - Good shot. - What name I got? My man, you be Charles "The Cool." Charles The Cool! Who you be? Me? Yeah, you. I be... Pat "The Rat." Go get him, go get him. Mr. Bennington, I have a real chance to reach these kids. Coffee? No, thank you. This is a chance to expand their horizons beyond anything... How about some melon? No, I'm fine, thanks. It's delicious. No, thank you, really. By taking these kids into Washington, DC... Mr. Conroy, I think it's a wonderful idea. Now, if you are prepared to shoulder all responsibility, guarantee that there is absolutely no cost to the county, well, you have our full and unwavering support. What them ol' lines for? What lines? Them lines, them lines all over the road! Right. Well, um, those lines are divider lines. They... they tell the driver which side of the road he can stay on. Now, you see, if they're dotted, means he can pass another car, and if it's a double line, it means he can't pass. Just them lines say all that? Yeah. Just them lines say all that. Lincoln. Yup. Them building's be scraping the sky. Ain't never seen nothing like that. Where all them cars going? You got that? You got that? Look at that; it's spinning! That's the Earth, Prophet. What's that? That's a picture of the Earth from the moon. What do you think, Oscar? It's wicked! Neat? These pictures are amazing. This is like Cinderella. We got to find whose shoe it is. Mr. Conroy, you try it. Let me get in there. Hey, can I take everybody's picture? Okay, everybody get your picture taken here. Back up a little bit. Got it? Okay, close together. Get together; come in. Frank, I can't see you behind that hat. Okay, ready? Count of three. One, two, three, cheese! Cheese! Look like my Oscar been to the moon hisself. Springtime came to Yamacraw with more bold promise than I'd experienced in some time. My spirit was uplifted, and my hopes were high for the children as graduation day approached. It is my great honor today to introduce the best friend Yamacraw ever had-- Mr. Ezra Bennington. Boys and girls, good parents of Yamacraw, I just want to say that I think Yamacraw is as fine a school as any in this country, despite what some people might say. Now, sure, we got a few problems here. You show me a school in this country that doesn't have problems, I'll show you a cow without udders. Now, I mean, when I first came here, we had a plethora of problems, didn't we, didn't we? Well, I remember I had to put in that electricity there, didn't I; remember that? And the air conditioning. We got a couple more things we got to clear up. Okay, wait, shh, everyone, everyone, everyone. Settle down. You all passed the state requirements fair and square? I want you guys to know how proud I am of you. All right? Congratulations. Okay, everybody, one last piece of business. With the consent of all you parents, Barbara and I would like to invite you all to our house across the river for a graduation party. Everybody can come 'cause Zeke brought the big boat. Mozart! Zeke. Hello, Mr. Bennington. Bach! Beethoven! Congratulations, Mr. Conroy. Thank you, Mrs. Brown. Chopin! Your pecan pie is delicious. Beethoven! Mr. Conroy. May I have a word with you, please? Yeah, sure. Grieg! What do you mean "consider other options"? Well, Mr. Conroy, it means that next year your services will no longer be required at Yamacraw. So, in other words, I'm fired? Well, let's just put it this way-- you are expendable. Lovely party; thank you. And, my regards to your wife. Mendelssohn! Could you please explain to me why I'm being fired? Because you have been consistently late, and it is against the rule for teachers to be late. No exception. And you, young man, you've been trying to make an exception of yourself all year. So, you'd fire me for getting lost in the fog a couple times? If you didn't commute, you wouldn't be lost, and if you weren't lost, you wouldn't be late. So, this is about my commuting. No, it's about your entire attitude. It's about your ignoring the chain of command. I have followed your blessed chain of command link by link; that's why I'm here. You endangered the lives of those young children by taking them on a wild ride to Washington. Bennington gave his approval. Well, if he did, he exceeded his authority. He set me up for this. I will not pay for gas, I will not tolerate your lateness, and I will not tolerate your willful neglect of my authority. You are hereby dismissed from Yamacraw, sir. What is the matter with you, boy? You going to let yourself be dishonored by some bow-tie gasbag never took hold of nothing rougher than a golf club? Don't you know a Conroy never backs down. A Conroy takes crap from no man! Is there anything else? You know, Dr. P... Dr. Piedmont, you leave me no choice but to take my cause to the Board of Education. Your "cause." Your cause, sir. You go right ahead. Well, I'm not worried-- not a little bit. Heck, I was told that Beaumont has the most democratic school system in the whole country. No! Your turn. You know, they're going to load my record with, well, I don't know what, but whatever it is, they're going to make sure I never teach again. Well, can I ask you something? You sure this is about you righting a wrong, or is it you picking a fight? Listen, this is how I was raised. You fight or you fold; you win or you die. There's no middle ground. It's the Conroy way. But are you sure it's your way? I'm dead sure. Is that you talking, or your father? You are too good for them, Pat. In this case, there is a middle ground. You can choose to walk away. You've got the parents on track. They can take it from here. You know that, right? I can't go down; not like this. Your move, Daddy. Thank you, sweetie. It came to pass there was a meeting of the Beaumont County School Board. The regulars showed up right on time. And so did the irregulars. He the one, ain't he? The one over there with Bennington? Yes, ma'am, that's him. I should have brought my Betsy out of that house, all loaded up, drop that man down where he should be. Can't go around filling folks with buckshot, Edna. Whole world ain't like Yamacraw. Pity. You wear that same tie... you wear that tie every single time I see you. I owe you five bucks. I promised; that was great fun. On the matter regarding Mr. Conroy's service on Yamacraw Island, the school board has reviewed Mr. Conroy's record of insubordination, gross neglect of duty, and conduct unbecoming a professional educator. Hold on, now! Hold on! Any more of that ruckus, and we'll clear the room! Sir, may I speak to my record? Make it brief. Gross neglect of duty, conduct unbecoming-- these all sound like very serious charges-- charges that could easily find their way into a court of law. Sonny-boy, are you threatening this fine board with a lawsuit? Is that what you're doing? Dr. Piedmont, this is my time. Dr. Piedmont has the floor. Folks, what you're getting here is just a little taste of this young man's obstreperous nature. This is a young man who thinks he can take children on a field trip to our nation's capitol without proper authorization. I had proper authorization. The Beaumont School Board rules to uphold its decision to terminate employment. Mr. Chairman. Excuse me, Mr. Chairman, I only want... I just want to say... Go on, Mrs. Brown. We don't have all night. Yes, sir. Just want to say that, um, personally, as a colleague of Mr. Conroy... ...I find your decision... ...unfair. Thank you, Mrs. Brown. This meeting is adjourned. Only one thing to do. We gonna get all the folks-- kids, too-- everybody on Yamacraw gonna mark his name, and if they don't bring y'all back, we gonna strike the school. Edna, I don't know if... Ain't for you to know. Time for us to know. Time for Piedmont to know. Mr. Big Ball Superintendent... you ain't off the hot stove yet. Quick Step, you sign this here petition. Here, make your best mark. What do they think they're doing? Sticking to their word, looks like. Conroy doesn't get reinstated, they're going to strike the school. I'll find out. All right, everybody, calm down. Calm down now. Come on, now, listen to me. Give me that. It is mine. Hey, give it to me. It is mine. It's my district. Listen up, people! Calm down, now! Come on, calm down! Now, you listen to me! If you people strike the school and do not allow your children to attend class this fall, you are going to be breaking the compulsory attendance law. You are going to be facing a fine of $50 per day. Listen, now, listen! Piedmont read them the riot act through a bullhorn, but the folks of Yamacraw read it right back with no need to amplify their voice. Look, now, look, I've got the most democratic school system in this country! This our school! Ain't no mainland school! Who teach our children be our business. Ain't nothin' to do with no big ball superintendent! Get out of here. Come on. Get out. Let me guess what you're thinking. "A Conroy never backs down. A Conroy takes crap from no man." But... you're not him. You're you. A loser teacher who can't hold a job 'cause he loves kids too much. I love you. I ever tell you that? Not nearly enough. You ever seen a snake milk a cow? Put him over the hot fire, and then the fur all of sudden will scrunch right up. You still ugly. Beethoven! You said good we question authority. Mr. Conroy. I appreciate what you said at the meeting. I know that wasn't easy. You might enjoy this. Really helped me. So long, Mrs. Brown. Conroy, take care of yourself. You have a good summer, now. All right? Gonna miss them shrimp. We got this here petition signed, just like I said. Every parent on the island signed it. Now, we gonna take it down to the next board meeting and... Deliver the news! This is very well written. They'd be impressed. I know that I am. But I don't want you to do it. In the end, it's these kids who are going to end up losing. They lose if you don't teach 'em. We don't want our children hit no more. It ain't right. I think that maybe Mrs. Brown is starting to see the light on that. And besides, there are plenty of other teachers-- most of them way smarter than me. You smart. Smart? You are, Teach. Hold on. Hol... Please. Hold, please. Maybe you all can't see it yet, but you've already won. That school is yours now. You stood your ground, and they got the message that you're in charge of your children's education. All you have to do now is stay involved... always. And never back down. Never back down. No, don't leave! Come back! Come back! Please, come back! But Mr. Conroy! Well, what about you? What are you gonna do? I've got this little girl who just started calling me "Daddy." I'm going to be sure it stays that way. You all look out for yourselves. We takes care of our own. Edna, you are a magnificent creature. You're a queen, a saint. All right, all right. Go on. Go well. Hey, Teacher Man, what state we at? South Carolina. State capital name? Columbia! Closest planet to the sun? Mercury! One time, a man say we got to question the rule and the law and not believe a thing just 'cause the big cheese say it so. Ralph Waldo Emerson. I wondered then, as I do now, whose life got changed more. Was it theirs... or mine? Kids, parents, the island, me... I knew nothing would ever be the same. It shouldn't be. The river was rising with the tide. A tide was rising in the country. The water was wide. I wished my students a safe crossing. Captioning sponsored by CBS
