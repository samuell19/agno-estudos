Still a no? I told you so. Let's eat first. I'm full. You had a lot of bookings? Not really. Your massage later is for free. If your energy permits. Don't test me! Okay, fine. - Where are we going? - Over there. Come on. We'll cross here. Have you enrolled? That's why we're here. I'm short of my tuition fee. I still have a class. Damn it. You'll be late. You know I don't like kisses. I'm close. Your payment? - Hey, hey, she's over there! - Talk to her! Miss... can we enjoy your company? Jeez! Alcohol makes you talk in English. Looks like your allowance is running low. You have wheels? None. I hail my ride! Choosy, man! What a waste. I need a ride. Let's hail a taxi, then, you know... Chill! Bro, I don't have money here. Maybe next time. Let's just play billiards. There. Let's be textmates for now. Why not? Nice! Happy! Call or text me. Bye! Happy... Happy pill. Nice one! Lie on your back, sir. Sir! Condom. I didn't agree with that. Ah, shit! Hi! Are you a massage therapist? Do you need a ride? Let's eat. Put your bag at the back. Where do you want to eat? Anywhere. Are you sure? Yes. You're nice. Thank you. How long have you been a massage therapist? Quite recently. My clients so far are all satisfied. I don't do it often. I'm a nursing student. You know... I'm amazed with working students like you. How resourceful. How did you learn about the white handkerchief? I've been looking for a massage therapist. One time, a student taught me about tying a white handkerchief... and someone will approach my car. Voila! It's you! Will you ask for the extra? I won't! Just a massage. - You almost had me! - Relax! What's your work? Wedding planner. Fit for a rom-com! Not really. I simply arrange love ceremonies. See? Where's your massage parlor located? Do you do home service? Yes! Home service like a freelancer. It's more convenient at home. You're more relaxed. Right now? My arms are hurting. You spend so much time in front of the computer? How did you know? That's a usual complaint. Exhausted on the computer... Amazing! You know... You can be a model. Your complexion is good. Do you want to? Please lock the door. Thanks. Your place looks nice. Thank you. I just moved it. Should I massage you here? Upstairs. Let's go to my room. Alright. Need help? - I can manage. - Are you sure? How old are you again? 20. 20? You're so young! - Just looks like it. - Just the looks? Where do you live? Near where you found me. Okay. You have a lot of rooms! This is our guest room. This is our stockroom for old stuff. That's always locked. Our restroom. And this is my room. Watch out for your oils and creams. They might spill on the floor, or bed sheets. - Alright. - Let's go. Do you want to be a model? - Me? - Yeah. I'm serious. My business partner is a photographer. Business partner? He's not my boyfriend. He owns that studio upstairs. Okay. Where's your family? They're in the province. I went to Manila to study. Who taught you to massage? My grandmother. That's cool. You have an extra income to fend for yourself. Yes, but... it's not enough. Our tuition fee had increased. We were destined to meet. Why? They pay well at the photo shoot. What photo shoot? Don't you want extra income? Who knows, you might get popular. That's easy money. And... I can tell Leo that you'll be our model. Leo? He's my business partner who's a photographer. Won't it be a problem? It's not a problem at all. I thought you're a wedding planner. You sound like a talent scout. Leo is looking for a calendar girl. There's no harm in trying, right? Are you game? Sure. I'll try. Perfect. I'll message him. Later, after the massage. Here's my payment. What if your new talent doesn't come back? We'll go look for another! Speak of the devil. She's here. Bye. Okay, bye. - Hi! - Hi! - How are you? - I'm fine. - It must be hot outside. - It sure is! You're gorgeous as always! Thank you! - Are you excited? - I guess so! Really? May I use your bathroom? - Just go straight ahead. - Okay. Precious, when are you gonna pay me? It's long overdue. How dare you? I told you I can't do anything anymore. What do you mean you can't do anything? I didn't even ask for the money, and now you're asking for the balance? I worked for it! You, fucking snake! Me, snake? It was Leo who flirted with me! It's taking its toll on you now. You owe me, so it's taking toll on you and not me! So, pay me your long overdue debt! I gave you my hand, and you take the whole fucking arm, no? But I worked for it! I told you I don't know where to search! That's not my problem anymore, just pay me! So annoying! You're out of tissues. That room is rarely used. By the way… I didn't bring a lot of clothes. What do you have? Casual, formal, cutesy. Okay. We can look for clothes upstairs. Let's go? Oops, my bag! Do we have to lock the door? No need. Leo's coming. - Okay. - Let me help you. - I can do it. - That's heavy. It's on you! Let me catch my breath. This is our studio. Looks neat, isn't it? Put your stuff over here. Leo's still not here! I can't contact him. Pardon our photographer's discipline. I asked him to come at 8AM. That's 9AM for him. You know how Filipino time works. Is there a time management course at school? None. But you need to cram for your hustles. I feel like what they only care for is the money. You're lucky if your teacher is hardworking. Diploma mill! College doesn't teach us reality. It's good you know way past that. I dream of finishing college and landing on a job. What job works for you? Every year, there are so many college graduates, but there are also those who are unemployed. How can you make a difference? Right? Who knows, I might become a magazine editor. Sexy magazine? - No! - You're taking up nursing, aren't you? I also want to write for a fashion magazine. You know... That work could starve you. How much would you earn for a single article? You won't earn that much! Unless you're an influencer, and you have lots of followers. You have a point. Hey, watch out for the floor. What time is it? You're so late! Your phone can't be reached. Where did you come from? I went to a drinking session last night. - I don't care. What time is it? - So I slept at my friend's house. Leo, this is Happy. Our new talent. Is that her? Nice to meet you, Happy. Too formal. Nice to meet you too. What a gentleman! Don't flatter him. And you, you're getting on my nerves! Watch out for the floor, I said! I met him at the university area. I take graduation photos as a side hustle. We have my graduation photographer here. Why not? Okay, let's get down to business. Let's go! - Let's go. - Okay. Happy, come here, let's fix you up. You're a great makeup artist, Precious! You need to be so beautiful! You have high standards. Of course! Especially in business. If you want to make it, you have to be your best. I guess our photographer is good as well. With cameras. So why aren't you together? You know, Happy, personal and business life are two separate matters. They're both messy. And Leo… He's a former talent when I had a casting company. What a waste! Financial loss? Not really. I make more money here, though. In casting, your pay depends on your talents. This is way better. You have a point. How about this pose? There you go! This? Right. That's about it. So... what will we do? I'm gonna be honest with you. We have clients with fetish. They would want you to wear specific things. It's up to you. You may back out. Just tell me. So, is this for the calendar girl? Yes, as if you're a student. Also, our clients give bonus. That sounds good. You seem to be ready now. I'll take photos and videos of you. Remember to smile to the camera. Bend your body a little bit. There. Nice. Very good. Nice. Hold on. Wait. Play with it. Just play around. There. Chin up. Fantastic. Now stand up. Look at me only. There. - Bye! Thanks. - Bye! - Need help? - No, thanks. - Take care. - They should! Bye. - Your shoes. - Don't mind them. - Your shoes... - Later. The painting. Stop talking! The painting... Hey. I'm leaving. - I'm leaving now. - Okay. What time should I come back? I'll be quick. I'm done after gym. Take care of the things here. - Yes. - Enjoy! Look who's jealous. Don't worry, I'll massage you later. - Be sure. - Yes. Look after the house. - My kiss? - Whatever! Hey. My kiss! Geez. Hey, girl! Why are you late? I got into trouble with a talent in my project. I'm so busy because of it. You should've had me instead. We need a girl. But it's okay now. I found one. Don't I pass for a girl? Know what's better for you? You'd pass for a goon in the movies. Or a heartthrob, how about that? Heartthrob of gay people. Stop it, Dorotheo III. Dorie! Dorie? I'll contact you if you ever pass for a project. Promise? Of course, I got you, baby. Where's Gwyneth? She's still working out. Okay. I'll go now. That's enough running for today. I'll go to the steam bath. - Life's simple pleasures. - You're flirting again? Enjoy! - Hi! - Hi, Gwyneth! How long have you been here? One month. LEO - Question: What animal is usually fought over? Answer: Woman. The most beautiful animal in the world. Hello! That's a corny pickup line. Sorry, I'm not used to it. I see. Anyway, have you printed our photos? Yes, I got it with me. There! When can I see it? I'm supposed to bring it over to you. But my body is aching. Do you have a client today? None. Home service? Bye now. What's with the smile? Getting giddy? Not really. What's up? - Secret. - Your smile is different. Come in. We can do the massage there. I also prepared your photos on the table. - I can see them now? - Of course! I'm pretty. How did you do this? Hey, those are not edited. I just found the correct angles. Also, you are really beautiful. Stop flattering me. I'm dead serious. What's with the low self-confidence? You're a natural in front of the camera. Another pickup line? Nah. That's the truth. And only but the truth, so help me God! What does God have to do with it? Prepare for his wrath. So... any favorites? This one. This. And you. Joke! I like this one. Stop, Leo. Take Precious into consideration. Why? Even if you're not together, I still respect her. Plus, you two are business partners. Don't you notice she likes you? How can you tell? I just can. I feel it. I like you. Stop it! You know your tricks! Of course. What now? My energy is drained for a massage. It's more than I need. Need, not want? All I want and need. You keep on flattering me. Does Precious know I'll be here? She doesn't. But it's fine. I only have to show you the photos, right? You showed more than those. How's your school? Two semesters to go. I still don't have the money to enroll. Don't worry. Modeling can take you far. You won't even need to do home service. It's as if you want me to choose you instead. Don't you want to? - Did I say something? - That's it! - For the most beautiful woman in the world. - Leo Up to my neck. Harder. There. Here. That's it? I'm getting sleepy. Isn't it bad to have a massage after gym? Sorry, I'll just rest. Do I need to defend myself again? Here we go again. You're drying me up! Stop it. Good thing, Precious got you as a talent. Why? You're pretty, sexy, and easy to talk to. This is talk for you? You're taking it literally. I'm talking literally! Stop it! - How are you? - All good. - Let's eat. - Let's go. - Just put your things there. - Sure. Coffee? - Okay. - Sit down. Is something's up? Leo's still not here. What's up? Exhausting! Got out on the wrong side of the bed? Your style is something, you know? I'm used to boys like that. They show off their cuteness when they did something wrong. She's taking your side? I was just late. Bread? You were also late last time. That's why Filipinos don't succeed. How lazy! Tardiness means laziness? You can lend your car so I won't be late. Commuting is difficult for the working class. I'm fed up with this business partner. I'm a human being, partner. I needed to recharge. That's why I had a long sleep. Why did you need to recharge? My hands almost got numbed for gripping on the train's handrail. Try taking the bus or the train. Why don't you take a cab? Where do you spend your earnings? You always see my shortcomings. Haven't you noticed, I'm always here beside you. Business partner, right? You should always comfort each other. Right? Let's dig in. We still have a photo shoot later. Speaking of which, here are our photos. - Let me see. - Here. Beautiful. That's beautiful. How about a rate increase? I like that idea! Gari-san! You will love this. Really? - Yes. - Okay. Okay. Good timing. Pretty. Here you go. Great doing business with you, Precious-san. You can download copies next time. Okay, but I want to see you in person. I pay extra. You're working too hard on yourself, Gari-san. It's for my retirement plan. Thank you. - Arigato! - Thank you. You're fond of thrift shops when you can buy new clothes. It's not just about being thrifty. What's more important is the good styles, the affordability, and fashionista vibes! Fashionista with rashes? - Hey! - I'm kidding. You can use disinfectant. It's like you stole clothes from the dead. Don't believe that. What matters is that you have new clothes. Someone told me that those clothes came from donations. Instead of actually giving them out, they sell them. Very Filipino. No. Foreigners do. Your stuff are all second-hand? Where do you spend your money? Nah. I spend it on my tuition and rent. You know, you can stay with me. - Really? - Yes. Once you become popular to clients, we will send more photos, and you'll earn more. - Do you want that? - I want that! Let's buy a birthday gift for Leo. He's expecting that. - Let's go? - Let's go! So there's a party? - Sure. - Yes. Game! - One, two, three, go! - One, two, three, go! Since we're almost out of that... I have a surprise for you. - I'll take your glasses. - What's that? Wait here. Leo, there's more! - Let's sit down. - I'm drunk already! What is he up to? - Let's hype things up! - Tequila? What? It's my birthday. Happy bir... hey! Don't mess with the carpet. - I'll take care of it. - I'm not strong with this. I'll clean things up. Let's do body shots! If you don't answer correctly, you will lick the salted body part. - Alright? - Fine. - Game? - I'm up to it. But... Make the questions easy. Why? - I'll lose right away. - That's better! Okay, game. I'll ask you first. The first question is for you. How old am I? 25. Why? You're flattering her. - What? - You're too modest. I am older than that but I won't specify. Okay, game, game. - Take off your shirt. - Is that it? Take it off! There. Is that it? Do it yourself. It's your birthday. I remember now. Be careful or it will spill on the carpet. I will clean everything up. Happy birthday! Hold it. Okay, game. You want here? - Anywhere. - Of course you like it. - Game? - Go! Wait, your hair. Go ahead. You're savoring the moment. You're devouring it, Happy. Very much happy! You tasted my skin? Sour? My turn. - Who will you ask? - For who? You! What worm do you put in a tequila? Is there a worm in tequila? I don't know. What question is that? - How about you? - I don't know. Neither do I! Because we don't know, it's on you, Precious. - Why me? - I just want it. Are you sure? - That's where you want it? - It feels like grains of sand. Are you breaking my neck? Check it out. Perfect! - Hey. - Hi. You no longer live in the boarding house. I moved out already. And I'm earning now. You didn't inform me. You're the busy bee! You're not answering my calls. I had no phone credits then. My parents have just sent me money. Wow! Big time! I'm touched. You just remember me when you have money. How about you invite me for lunch? Not now. I have to run some errands. You have a date? Your girlfriend who will become a nun? You could have taken me for a girlfriend. Excellent... in and out of bed. Crazy... I want an exclusive girlfriend. Exclusive? You only take me out when you have money. Do you still need it? Others will benefit from this. I enrolled already. Let's take a raincheck. Better yet, save up the money. Your father is working his ass off abroad, and you're spending the money for girls. I'll take you out next time. Is that still your number? Let me check! Not this anymore! You smell good! Let's go? Not this anymore. I have class, stupid. You always change your number. I need to avoid those pesky bastards like my prof. Save your new number. Let me. Use condoms. I'll get infected by your lewdness! See you next enrollment. Just text me if you change your mind. Let's see next semester. If you can't contact me, I'm still using my old email. Nice one! I'll go ahead. What? Is that her? - Yes, sir. - Is that her? What a curve, sir. And what a waste. That's not a waste. She's packed with benefits. Lots of it, sergeant! Miss, wait. May we speak to you? What's happening? We have a few questions. Let's get inside? Look what these tricksters can do. Sir, she's here. Good evening. Please have a seat. What's happening? We're from the anti-cybercrime unit. What? I'm just new here. Where did you get that? From a locked room. The stockroom? We better discuss this at our office. I have nothing to do with that. Just come with us. Sir! You'll come with us. Have a seat. Do you know him? No. I haven't seen him before. Why did you arrest him? Because of your video. Remember what I showed you? He usually comes to the Philippines to look for videos they will upload. I'll leave you here. I got this, Sarge. Mamaril. Mamaril! I have to call you twice? It's embarrassing with Ma'am Happy. What's taking you so long? Hold on. You're too slow. Happy! Wait up. I still have work. I'm here. That's okay now. You're too slow. That's fine now. You don't want anymore? I still have work. - You're in a hurry? - You're too slow! Good. After this, we'll call it quits. Yes. How about my videos? I'll handle that with our Japanese friend. It's not fair. You'll make money out of them. That's not my problem. No kissing. Happy! Happy? Shit! Happy! This is the last time you'll see me. If something bad happens to me, you'll see yourself on YT. Damn it! Damn it! I have no idea. She's going to do this. About who? The real estate agent? Yes, it should have been a showroom. My god. What a mess! Shit. Let it go. Our Japanese guy was caught. - We're paid, aren't we? - Yes, we are. Let's just do another. Drive to your place. - How about Happy? - You're looking for her? Damn it. What if she rats us out? That's what I mean. Are you stupid? She doesn't like publicity. How will she speak up? Or do you miss her mouth? Do you miss her? You're jealous now? - You enjoyed her last time too! - Screw you, Leo! What's your title? Bored Asian Teacher? What do you think? Looks like it's safe. Hurry up. Get out and I'll drive later. Alright. Don't leave me, okay? Waiter. What should we get? Let's see. - Ma'am, what's your order? - Two glasses of juice. - Okay. - Thank you. So... Take care. Someone might be following you. Me? You should take care. I am very careful unlike you. Yeah. I'm on it. Make sure. I'll walk you out. It's late. You're not coming? I got things to do. Are you sure? My kiss. - Bye. - Bye. Take care. Hi. How are you? I miss you. I'm good. I miss you too. Why did you two leave? I'm sorry. We had a problem. What happened? The owner of the house went home. I thought that was Precious' house. No. It's owned by a real estate client. The owner changed her mind. I see. How did you find me? You know. I find ways. What ways do you want me to find? I'm just passing by, Leo. When there's alcohol, there's intent. You have no class? None. I have something else to do. Why? Screw you! Fix yourself. Screw you too! Fix your own self. You took my gun and my handcuffs. I told you... if something bad happens to me, our video will leak. I told you, we're quits. You have your cards to play. What if I got more proof against the pornographer? You'll stop bugging me? Of course. As what action stars say, it's just a job. Good! Stop pestering the students. They just want to graduate. I know that. I was a working student back then. But why did you touch me? Because you're beautiful. I didn't force you. You went with me voluntarily. Hello, Sergeant? Stop pestering those girls. They're so young. Don't burn me. Unless they make the move on me, I won't touch them. I promise! Whatever you say. That's her! - You're going home? - Bye. - You have a ride? - It's just me. Take care. Anything you need? Take care! Bye! Do you want to join? Be cautious about the photographer. Babe, am I safe with that? Yes, babe. Go with the flow. We need to extract information. Video only? Check it out. It can also record audio. How does it work? Here's the camera. Here's the mic. Just press here to record. Hello? Happy birthday... Crazy! That's not karaoke. Do you get it now? - I'm on it. - Are you sure? Trust me. Babe, we just need information from them. What do I need? Just your beauty. Be natural in our photo shoot. Hi! Excuse me. May I ask? I heard you talking about a photo shoot. Is there a studio nearby? There are a few out there. But those are quite cheap ones. The quality could not be that good. I need something more presentable. If you want, I know someone, but it's quite far. What a shame. I better try outside. I need it for my resume. Thank you. Thanks! - There you go. - He's handsome. Come in. It's raining hard. Yeah, it's raining hard. I thought you'll fetch us. I was busy, I'm sorry. I'll get your things. Okay. Joy, this is Leo. Leo, this is Joy. - Hi! - Hello! He's my business partner and photographer. Let me show you our studio. Just be cautious with our stuff. It's not that many yet. Just beware not to scratch them. - Forgive her sensitivity. - No problem. My envelope. Thank you. Thank you. Let's go. You found a photo studio? Yes, just around the corner. Not that bad. - Good luck with your application. - Thanks. If you ever need a good photographer, here's Leo. He's so good! - Is that so, sir? - I guess. What do you usually take? Portraits. Portraits? I just went to a studio. Maybe next time. - Can't we do it now? - I have no camera. Kidding. - I'll go ahead. - Alright. - You're leaving? - Nice to meet you. - I'll go ahead too. Take care. - See you! - Let me show you our studio. - Let's go. Excellent! That's just the intro. Right. It's weak evidence. She could've been invited to the studio. Nothing else. They did nothing... Unlike you! Go, leak it. You're in it too. Make sure nothing bad happens to me. Your own video is bound to go viral. Wait a sec. You might want to see this. Is there a studio nearby? There are a few out there. But those are the cheap ones. The quality could not be that good. How did you retrieve this? Not even a "thank you"? Go ahead. I have multiple copies. Sorry, I lost my control. What's making you mad? They're just talking. Nothing. You're jealous, look at you. I'll come back once you're on your own. Hey! So that's why you're always sexy. Happy. How are you now? You're not answering our calls. Is that so? I never received any calls or texts from you. I'll show you something. What do you usually take? Portraits. He was the one looking for a studio. It seems like someone's looking for you. I need to go now. I'll call you. Okay. Be very careful. We need to go. Stop being a queen. We need to leave! Shit. What's up, baby Leo? Are you surprised? I'll have your cellphones, wallets, and watches. Put them inside Madam Precious' shoulder bag. - It's over there. - Baby, Leo. - I know. - Hurry up. What now? Do you have anything to say? Happy, let's talk about this. You get paid also, don't you? Paid? Hello? You made money out of the video you sold to the Japanese. The cat's out of the bag! The guy who's looking for a photo studio, he's a cop. He arrests those college students who sell their bodies for sex. Of course, they also benefit from those poor students. You're so screwed, Precious, you're not careful! I'm screwed? You're screwed too! Why blame it on me? - It's your fault! - Me? Shit! You're fooling each other. We strive for work but we don't fool around. No service is tendered for free. You're not born lucky. I don't have any commission? What do you want? You want a percentage? How much do you want? Too late, Precious. It's too late. Sergeant and I had a deal. Your arrest in exchange for my freedom. You won't take those college students for new victims. Perfect. These are heavy! - Drive now. - Are you going to kill us? You're overreacting. Are you insane? Happy, let's talk for a bit. Don't be like that. Baby Leo... Calm down. Precious, drive the car. Follow her. - Drive now! - Where will we go?! - Just follow. - But where? - Drive now. - To where? Drive. Straight ahead. It's okay here. Open the trunk. Are you overdosed with sex? You're deaf now. Now. Cuff her, Baby Leo. - Hurry up! - Fine. Your hand. What's happening to you, Precious? - Why are you crying? - What do you want? Your hand. - Hurry! - I know! Let me check. It's locked. There we have it! Great! So... we can call it quits. Your gun... - Do we call it quits? - Put your gun down! That could go off! Hush now, Precious. Stop it. I'm leaving. You're good with this? Yes! Bye! Don't move! Here's the key. Unlock yourselves. Don't cry! Hurry! Hurry up! Get out! Hurry up! Stop crying! Why are you crying? Over there! Hurry up! You're one hell of a trickster! Get on your knees! Kneel! - What the! - Damn you! Shoot him! Enough! For you. - That's mine. - Mine. - Looks nice! - This looks good on me. Miss! Are you alright? I'm alright. Why did you throw the traveling bag? That still works, right? - You could've given it to beggars. - My baggage is too heavy. It comes with misfortune. You threw a lot? Where are you heading? I can give you a ride. I like you. Gentleman. Where are you going? I'm just driving home. But if you need a ride, that's totally fine. That's a literal pickup line. Let's go?
