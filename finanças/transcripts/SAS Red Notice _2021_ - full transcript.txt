Less than one percent of the population is psychopathic. Psychopaths often inherit the trait and are incapable of love. They manage their relationships with clinical precision, succeeding in all walks of life. Psychopaths that can learn to love are even more rare. As rare as a black swan. It's time. I'm not dead yet. Naming a successor is a sign of strength, not weakness, Father. You've always had more ambition than your brother. Olly is more ambitious than you think. There's a difference between ambition and pride. He's just trying to impress you. Well, no matter how hard your brother tries, he'll always be replaceable. Boy, does he know you feel that way. I don't care, and neither should you. Last one of the day, boys. Let's light her up. Stay professional. - Morning. - Was when I got here. - What did you offer 'em? - Fifty fucking grand. Well, that's twice what you paid for the delay. Yeah, I already paid 'em a hundred. Pissed it away on whores and vodka. Yeah, well, do you blame 'em? No. I mean, I wouldn't wanna live in that fucking shithole. Well, they want more money. Clearly. Alright, increase the offer, but if it goes noisy, that's what you're here for. Grace. What's a fair price for that village? Two hundred? OK, well, if they refuse, cut their tongues out. - Is she capable of that? - Of course. Well, if she fucks it up, it's down to you. I just need that village cleared today, alright? Hey, Pop, is it unprofessional to burn him? My God, Olly. You really do have shit for brains. Enemy front! Go, go, go! Go. Up the hill. Switch fire right. Switch fire right. Out. Oh, it's just a scratch. You're good. They don't want money. They want a fight. Make a decision. Make it now. Kill the men and the boys, and leave the women to spread the fear. Welcome home, Thomas. Great to see you, Callum. Looking good as always. You staying for Christmas? I just came to pick something up. That's my job. Tell me what you need. I'll organize some tea. Thanks, but I'd rather do it myself. It's in Nanna's box. - Well, that is a surprise. - To me as well. Be nice to have some laughter in the house. Early days. I plan to keep my flat but weekend here. If Sophie fancies it. Will she be needing color charts for the nursery? You're worse than my mother. She would have been proud. Somehow I doubt that. Thomas, your parents were... My parents were wildly disappointed in me. Your nanna would have approved. Did you fix the windows in her library? All done, sir. We also planted another 40 acres of oak. Her favorite. That would be you, sir. - Thank you, Callum. - Of course, sir. Having second thoughts? Never. What is it, then? Did Nanna really love Grandpa? In her own way. Could you be any more obtuse? She had a special way of seeing the world, including your grandfather. For her, it was love. You understand? Beginning to. That's why she wanted you to have that ring. The great Henry Buckingham chopped it off the maharaja's finger during the Indian Mutiny and bequeathed it to her upon his passing. So the story goes. Your nanna did keep her secrets. Guess we'll never know the truth. I know she would be pleased. Sophie is a fine choice, Thomas. Then it's time. This just in from our sources. Red Notices have been issued for three members of the notorious Black Swans, a family-owned private military company linked to alleged atrocities in the Republic of Georgia. The three are Americans William Lewis and his adult children, Grace and Oliver Lewis. The family is reported to be living in North London. They're accused of crimes against humanity following an alleged massacre that has only now come to light. The remote area where it happened is known as a corridor for transnational gas pipelines. The International Criminal Court is demanding that the UK extradite the accused to the Hague where they will stand trial. The prime minister's office has so far refused to comment on the Red Notices or whether it plans to serve them, but we're waiting for further updates from Number Ten. It wasn't what we hired him to do. Doesn't matter. He stands trial, Lewis will say we sanctioned it. Well, you're PM. What do you wanna do? I mean, we could kick him into the long grass. You could do. But you do know this is not gonna blow over? Mercenaries have been tearing the arse out of it for decades. They may have done, but now every fucker has a mobile phone. - Fair one. - We could deport him. No. The Yanks won't eat our shit. Lewis lives here. He does his business here. He's been here for 40 years or so. He's just bought the Habsburg House. - What, in Hampstead Heath? - Yeah. Clearly we're paying him too much. Well, keeping our hands clean is a pricey business. And at that price, I expect them to be washed of this shite. There is a difference between disavowing Lewis and serving him with a Red Notice. He will expect a level of protection. No. I cannot be seen to protect a war criminal. So do you want me to go round his house and arrest him? No, I never said anything about an arrest. Lewis will have prepared for that too. There's a reason we hired him in the first place. And there's a reason I hired you. Natalie, can I grab those notes? Yes, Doctor. - Thank you. - There you go. - Hi, Dr Hart. - Hi. Surprise. - Surprise? - First-class ticket to Paris. Flight's at 1:30 tomorrow. Tom, that's lovely, but... I rang Dr. Wells. She agreed to take your shifts. I haven't spoken to you in three weeks, and the first person you call is my consultant to change my schedule? - Yeah. - Tom, that's not OK. You've been dying to go to Paris. I've been dying to spend some time with you. Good thing we're going together, then. Tom, stop. I'm sorry. Gotta sort something at work. - But you just got back. - It won't take long. I've heard that one before. It'll be alright. Meet you at the airport. - I haven't said yes yet. - Don't be late. Silly fucker. Hi, James. How's your leg today? I need everyone out. Now. Yeah, come on, everyone out. Let's go. I just got a message. The SAS is about to move on us. We can book a G4 out of Farnborough, fly home, take our chances there. England is home. Dad. After all these years, you're still not one of them. - Never will be. - Well, that's true. I'm one of me. So are you. Clements was just using us anyway. No. I've been using him for my own means. This government is addicted to what we do for them. In three to four hours, they're gonna break down that door and they are gonna arrest us. The last thing they want is an arrest. If I'd seen that girl with the phone... Next time. There won't be one unless we do something now. What would you have us do? Enact the safeguard. Big job. Simulated it six times. Casualties always a hundred percent. We're about to get shot in the back. Anything else from here is a bonus. OK. Are those pansies? Yeah. Yeah, they are. I'm with the Heath and Hampstead Society. Each year we select one household with the finest winter blossoms and feature it on our website. Thanks, but we're not interested. That's a shame. You've done such a brilliant job. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. I'm a bit tired. Are the pansies more fragrant to you? No, not really. Why? Some women develop a better sense of smell when they're pregnant. That's something to look forward to. - If you don't mind... - How many months are you? Six. Boy or a girl? They can't tell yet. You can determine the sex of a child at three months. And they're primroses. Not pansies. Red 1. I'm compromised out here. - Sitrep on the woman. - Neutralized. - What about the baby? - No baby. Just a fake belly rig concealing an automatic short. - Olivia, who is she? - She works security for Lewis. There's a 76% probability that he is on target. OK. Alpha. To confirm, this is a hard arrest on a William Lewis and known associates, aka the Black Swans, under Red Notice 790274 for crimes against humanity. Confirmed. There will be no threat to their life or reason. You will serve the Red Notice using nonlethal means. - Confirmed. - Stop fucking about. Red Notice calls for a hard arrestment. The moment you make contact, you will fight and you will kill him. This is London, not Londonderry. Enemy front. Enemy front. All call signs, this is Alpha. I have control. Go, go, go. There you go, mate. That's yours. Coming through. Smoke. Get the smoke down now. Red 6. Man down. Man down. Alpha. Roger that. My call sign moving now. Cover. Oh, fuck that. Sierra 1. I had to take it. Alpha. Red 7. Held at the rear. Cannot make entry. I say again: cannot make entry. Fuck it. Come on, mate. Smash it. Come on. Oh, shit. Red 1. Need door entry. Alpha. Roger that. Red 3. Moving now. Clear! Stoppage! Stoppage! - Clear! - Up. That's Red 9. Checking the garage. Out. Don't move! Don't move! Lewis confirmed. Dining room. Any eyes on Grace? Unsighted. Sierra 1. I've got movement on the ground floor. Red 1. Check it. Out. Sierra 1. That's moving up the stairwell. Now unsighted. Just in time for lunch. Where's Grace? Upstairs. Getting dressed. Oi. Fuck off and do your job. Roger that. Wow. It's like a fucking museum. I needed somewhere to put my stuff. It's been a busy life. Yeah, I know what you mean. I've got tons of this shit. I'm still going. And you're about to stop. Tom, man on! Man on! Stitched up by a kid with a mobile. Thank fuck they didn't have 'em in Rhodesia. - Good skills on this job. - Thank you. Word has it that Grace did the sniping. Tell 'em that I did that. If Grace sticks with that story, I'll ensure she's looked after. What, by the PM? Politicians come and go, mate. I'm the consistency. Grace is... Grace is good value. Every father loves their daughter. I've never loved anybody in my life. But Grace is special. In what way? Well, she's like me. Only better. Grace isn't joining us for lunch, is she, Lewis? You're gonna miss me, George. I'm not gonna miss cleaning up your mess. If you could do it with peace, love and a steak dinner, you would. Everyone is replaceable. Even a Black Swan. - Stand still! Stand still! - Stand still! Stand still! Turn! Show your face! Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you! Grenade! Fuck. - You alright, mate? - Oh, yeah, living the dream. Oh, shit. Oh, cheers, mate. Ooh. Your jacket's ruined. What you gonna wear for grouse hunting this year? Fuck off. You were supposed to use nonlethal means. Didn't have a choice. He's right, boss. Target had a grenade. Pulled the pin on us. Oh. Was that before or after Tom shot her in the face? - Nasal spine, actually. - Ha. Ha-ha-ha. And how do you expect me to sell that up the food chain, let alone the Guardian? And she looked nothing like Grace Lewis. - What? - The woman. The one I shot. Nothing like her. We cordoned off the residence an hour prior to the raid. Everest 1 was drawing us in there. Giving Grace time to escape. OK, well, I'll issue an all-ports warning. But this is why you're supposed to use nonlethal means, so whoever it is that we're looking for ends up on the floor in cuffs instead of on the floor dead! Grace isn't dead, boss. They knew we were coming. The only question is how? Well, that's a question for another day. You're stood down till I fill out my report. Well, hang on, boss. You weren't there. Order stands. And get that sorted. Nasty, that. That's Alpha now airborne. Out. You alright, mate? Yeah. - That's balls, innit? - What? - You getting stood down. - Oh. It'll be alright. - You? - Oh, yeah. Yeah, that blast is nothing compared to the damage your couch has done to my back. You'll be happy to fuck off at the end of the month, then. Eh? What, you and Soph moving in together? More than that. Oh, Christ. Well, come on, then, let's see it. - What? - The ring. It must rival Gibraltar. Nah. It's just something my nanna gave me. I'm sure Soph'll be suitably impressed. She's quite sober when it comes to money. Well, it's easy for you to say. My ex-missus burned my bank statement. Dumped the ashes in my mouth. 'Cause you paid for lap dances with your credit card. Yeah, I was pissed, though, wasn't I? Oh, man, you haven't got a clue what you're getting yourself into. - No. - You haven't, have you? It'll be alright. So, what, you gonna leave the regiment? Of course not. It's home. Do you love her? Yeah. Mate, how long have we known each other? Since basic. Why? In that whole time, I have never ever known you to love anyone. - Well, this is different. - Oh, yeah? How's that? Fuck off. Go on, boys, let's go. In the van. The fact that the international Red Notice had been issued against William Lewis, who was, unbeknownst to his neighbors, the leader of an internationally renowned group of military contractors or mercenaries known as the Black Swans... Do they not have doctors in the SAS? In Hereford. Wouldn't wanna miss our flight. Well, I'm afraid triage is not my area. Well, you've done a good job. Are you sure you don't want anything for the pain? No. ...along with another unidentified female who sustained fatal head injuries... - Do you wanna talk about it? - What? It isn't clear whether all of the members of the Black Swans have been apprehended, but an all-ports... Were you the one who, um... Shot her? Yeah. Yeah, in the face. Are you upset? She was in the fight. It was me or her. Still, don't you find it disturbing? No. I should know better by now. - What do you want me to say? - I don't know, Tom. Does anything ever affect you? Ever? No, never. Apart from you. I really wanna believe that right now. Then do. We're so different. Well, that's what makes it work. Look, I love being with you, Tom... but I don't understand you. Then let's talk about this. In Paris. Hmm? Only if you're willing to really talk. Absolutely. We will spend the entire time in Paris in bed talking. There is something seriously wrong with you, Tom Buckingham. You still have your plane ticket? Nah, I binned it. Good. Change of plans. I'm taking you on the first train to Paris before you can bin me too. Tom. Eurostream train 2196 to Paris Gare du Nord will depart from platform number 10. That's platform number 10, Eurostream service to Paris Gare du Nord. Where are you travelling today? We're going to Paris. Yeah. Your bad French all weekend, is it? Right here. Coach A. - Up you go. - Thank you, darling. Please ensure your belongings and your luggage are kept with you at all times. If you notice any suspicious items, please report them to a member of staff. Unfinished business? Hmm? Nah. Nah, the lads'll sort it out. - I don't know how you do that. - What? Switch on and off like that. You should try it some time. Hey, what if it was me? In the fight? - You? - Yeah. Would you shoot me too? If you had a go at me, yeah. That's why I'm taking you to Paris. Keep on your good side. Tom, who is this woman? What woman? The one with her face plastered all over the newspaper. - Yeah, didn't see that. - It's hard to miss. Easier than you think. Tom, what really happened yesterday? 'Cause you can tell me. Tom, where are you going? To the gents. I won't be long. Pardon, monsieur. Your passport? Hello? Is anyone there? Il y a quelqu'un? I'm sorry. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to come in. Shh. It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be OK. Shh. Excusez-nous. Allez, passe, ma chérie. Anyone in there? Morning, mate. How are you? I have Grace Lewis on the Eurostream to Paris Gare du Nord. - Grace Lewis? - Train's mobile. We're approaching the Channel Tunnel. Hold on. What are you doing on the Eurostream? Just wait till he's older. Takes them ages to have a pee. If that was his only flaw, I'd marry him tomorrow. Well, it's six o'clock somewhere. Aren't you having one? Sure. A marriage proposal? One day after he dropped a woman on Hampstead Heath? You know Tom. He's a romantic. Well, this time, before I do anything, I need eyes on Grace. - Have Tom confirm it. - Alright. - Boss wants Grace confirmed. - We're almost in the tunnel. Right, then safest option, just let the French lift Grace at Gare du Nord. - No, fuck it. I'll confirm her. - Tom, wai... I've been married 53 years and I still don't understand the old sweat. So it doesn't get any better, then? Sorry? So it doesn't get any better, then? - No, not really. - Damn. I don't know. We're just so different. In what way? He takes lives for a living. I save them. Oh, I see. Military man, is he? It has its uses, dear. Tom pretends it doesn't affect him, but it must do. Well, not everyone needs a shoulder to cry on. I'd be lucky if he even shrugged his shoulders, let alone shed a tear. And that's a problem, is it? Well, yeah. His crazy brain has a unique ability to drive me crazy. A man running long in the loo is not unique. God alone knows what they do in there. Shall I tell you what he did to my dead cat? - Your dead cat? - Yeah. He found Chica in the garden, brought her in my flat draped over his arm in full rigor mortis. Oh, I see. He then proceeded to suggest we put her in the freezer until we got back from holiday. - Oh, right. - I refused, of course. We canceled our holiday and gave her a proper burial. Cover. This is a red trigger... Oh! Clear the tunnel and dispatch the fire response team. Getting eyes on the flash points now. Wow. Really? Yeah. Well, it looked way better on him. - And the kit? - Relax. I got you. You're only as good as your worst day, huh? OK, listen in. Remember, short, sharp commands. We need to take control immediately. If anyone disobeys, ignores, doesn't understand, tough shit. You will make an example of them. We need to grip that train from the get-go. You understand? Remember, all keep switched on. Everyone, fingers out your arses. We need to move in two. Breach! Breach! - On me. - Come on, go! Cover me. - Who the fuck was that? - Don't know. But he's trained. Everybody back. Oh, my God. What's happened? Oh. Oh, I've got... I've got some glass in my leg. OK. Don't worry, I'll get it out. Oh, fuck. OK. Just keep still. It's gonna be alright. This is Dr. Hart. Please leave a message. Stay in your seat. I'm coming for you. There's a player in the battle space. He's armed and skilled. Check the tunnel, check the train, check the passengers, and do not let him get away. - Roger. We're on it. - Everyone spread out. Alright. This'll stop the bleeding. It's gonna be alright. Assieds-toi. Reste ici. Les filles, non, vous asseyez. Asseyez-vous. Everybody sit down! Don't you fucking move! Heads down! You, eyes down now! Stay down! Down! Move! If you want to live, shut the fuck up. Don't move! Stay where you are! Everyone remain calm. Get back in your seats. Keep your hands above your heads. I said get the fuck back to your seat. Listen in. Do what you're told when you're told, and that... Sit the fuck down! And that will not happen to you. Heads down. I just need to get her inhaler. Please... Get back in your fucking seat. - I need you outside. - Yeah, alright, now. - Give us what you got, mate. - Grace confirmed. I don't know what it means yet, but it's not an escape, it's an attack. She's got support down here. About two dozen Swans, all armed. Stand to the team. You gonna come out and meet us at the point of entry, yeah? I have to find Sophie. Too many Swans, mate. They'll smash you. Just wait till we get there. No time. Text me when you're on site. I'm gonna run a CTR. If you attempt to disembark, you'll be shot and killed, so please stay on the train. Do what you're told when you're told. Get fucking down. Just sit down! Get down now! Be fucking quiet! If you can see my eyes, I can see yours! Look at the fucking ground! Shit. Everyone stay down, stay calm, do not fucking move, take deep breaths, and all will be fine. Don't fuck about. Don't make me shoot you. Stay fucking calm. I don't care what Tom wants. Tell him to withdraw from the tunnel. Well, he's already on a close target recce. Look. Tom is putting innocent lives in danger. Get him out. And forward me those photos. I need to run 'em up the food chain. The PM has asked for all the latest intelligence. There you go. Sent. Service tunnel secure, and UK-bound tunnel blocked by fire and thick smoke. Roger that. Start the drilling. Get me a sitrep in five. I want the player found and dropped now. Papa 1-4. All my call signs ready to load. Papa 1-6. Confirmed. Alpha. All red call signs now airborne. Guns are set. Player's running a CTR. He's looking for holes in your protection bubble. And a way into the carriages. Especially seven, eight and nine. Good work. Find the player. Confiscate every phone from every passenger in every coach. If someone refuses, shoot them. Please hand over any electronic devices. There you are. In your own time, sir. In your own time, gentlemen. Thank you. Really? - What? - What, are you 12? Am I gonna get it back? It cost me 500 quid. And I'm the criminal. Some major breaking news to bring you. Multiple sources are telling us that a Eurostream train has been hijacked. We have very few details so far. What we do know is that the train was heading for Paris Gare du Nord when it was commandeered in the Channel Tunnel. There's no word on who's behind it or what their motives might be, but if confirmed, this would be a major incident on British soil. Why is she still breathing? I zapped Lewis at Hampstead Heath, but Grace weren't in. - But how did she manage that? - Someone might have warned her. - Someone? - I'll find him. - Sky News has it. - Do they have Grace? Not yet. Still speculating. Right. I'm convening Cobra. If she exposes what we've done, this is not just a problem for you, this is a very big problem for me. The Eurostream has stopped on British soil, so it's your call. Do I have control? Yes. Get down there and kill her. Listen up! I need everyone's phones out. Phones out. - Where's your phone? - I do not have one. I lost it during the explosion. Shame. Anyone have any medical training on this train, huh? Can you get a doctor? Papa 1-4. On final approach to the tunnel. I'm a doctor. Can you fix, uh, it? If I can get a trauma kit and some running water, then yeah. I'm gonna take care of you, OK? Come on. It's alright. Come on. It's gonna be OK. Stay close. Red 2. UK-bound tunnel compromised by fire and smoke. French tunnel compromised by up to 24 Black Swans. All red call signs will proceed via central service tunnel. Papa 1-5. Final approach now. Papa 1-6. Holding. All call signs, this is Alpha. Hold at the tunnel entrance. Red 1-6. Roger that. Out. It's OK, it's OK. Stay there. Can we have some privacy, please? Red 2. Fire door, 20 meters out. Everyone. Red 3. Fire door is obstructed. Needs explosive entry and that will compromise us. All call signs set up a control point. OK. - Any word from Tom? - I'm waiting on a call back. - Olivia, up yet? - No, nothing, sir. Right, listen in. Stand to the emergency response. - I want the team in now. - We've just set up. So's Grace. - We're completely in the blind. - Get some fucking glasses. - They zapped the CCTV, sir. - We need people on the ground. We need to carry out a proper CTR. - Well, who took these, then? - Tom. Tom? Buckingham. Was he the bloke that zapped that woman on Hampstead Heath? - Yeah. - Good skills for a posh twat. So, hold on a minute. How come he's inside the cordon? He was taking his girlfriend to Paris to propose. Well, the Swans have done him a fucking favor, then. OK, back to what we're here for. These photos are not enough. Well, they are today, 'cause Grace is the target. We have no idea where she is. The moment you make contact, Grace will close in and she will fight. But today she's got nowhere to go. My job is to rescue hostages. Not today. Hit that train now. If we do that, we will take casualties. Just give me a moment to plan a deliberate option... What are you, the head of a fucking knitting circle? The Swans are split up, two to a carriage. - Now's the time to attack. - I don't agree with you. Well, you can disagree all you fucking like, mate, but this is what's gonna happen. You are gonna act like a professional soldier. You are gonna initiate emergency response. And you are gonna kill Grace. And if you don't, you are off and he is on. Do you understand? Oh, fucking hell. Shit. Not right now, if you don't mind. Here. Unscrew the toilet and I'll get you down. No. No? What do you mean, no? I need to stay here and help the wounded. Soph, the team are about to hit this train, and when they do, there are gonna be a lot more casualties. You're not gonna be one of them. Sorry. I'm staying here. I have a wounded girl here. Save her instead. If you stay on this train, you will die. - I am not leaving. - Soph... I am not leaving. Roger that. Red 2. Moving now. Alpha. Good luck. Out. Sierra 1. Rear locomotive unmanned. Roger that. Proceed. What's going on in there? OK, come on. Quickly. Quickly. Oi. What's going on? That's it. There you go. - Open the door. - Jesus Christ, Tom. - Open the door. - What? You'd make a great father. - Well, it worked, didn't it? - Oi! - Open the door! - Knock me out. - What? - I said open the fucking door! So it doesn't look like I helped you. Open this door now. It's a good idea. The kid escaped. Up top! Contact! This is Alpha. Withdraw now. Bin it! Bin it! Bin it! Coach 9. Converge. Converge! Move! Stop! Fuck. Shit. Move! Move. Move! Shit. Move! What happened here? The player breached in, smashed the doctor, lifted the kid. He's more effective than the SAS. I pushed them back to the control point. Yeah, because my source told us that they were coming. - Your fucking snide? - He's our fucking snide. And he's a critical part of this operation. Yeah, well, someone still had to pull the trigger. And it's a really good skill. Now use it to find the kid and the player. They were last seen down there. You're all doing a good job. Stay just like that and not long from now you'll be safe at home selling your story to the papers. Be famous, not dead. - That was a gang fuck. - Who's down? - It was Rich and Pat. - Shit. So where is she? Is that really your major concern right now? No, my major concern is that you fucked it up. I told you it was too soon. And I told you I wanted Grace dead. - So where is she? - She knew we were coming. - How? - I don't know. The Swans weren't split up two per carriage. They were on the roof of the train, waiting to smash us. He's right, it was a trap. Who installed Skype on an internal system? This came in via our intranet. Should I... Should I answer it? Yeah, go on. I wanna speak to the ground commander. Major Bisset. Special Air Service. I'm here to negotiate a peaceful resolution. Thanks to your assault yesterday, we're left with only two options. Which are? The prime minister can go on live TV and admit that the British government ordered that clearing op in Georgia. Or he can outfit that Eurocopter you flew in with extra fuel bladders and wire 500 million to an account of my designation. That's a lot of money to organize. Britgaz can manage it. - Why would they pay for it? - They hired us to do the job. Well, actually, they hired the SAS to hire us. But those details are best left for the war crimes tribunal. In the event we don't get that ransom. That's really not my concern. - My only job is to protect... - Protect British interests. Both military and economic. Ask Clements. I'm sure he's lurking around your control point. I want a hundred hostages released as a show of good faith. Agreed. But you'll have to come and get them yourself. And bring Clements. What you fucking looking at? You know she only wants you in there so she can kill you? Yeah. And the only reason I'm going in there is to kill her first. Oh, really? How you gonna do that? Find out when we get there. This is 1-4. I have a weeper. He's hyperventilating. Crying, begging, starting to lose it. I need someone to me now to lift him and isolate him... Viens. Viens, viens. All call signs. Rear cockpit. Go! The player's in the rear cockpit. Go, go, go! Fuck. Where's the player? He saved the girl. But stayed in the fight. - There you are. - Merci, monsieur. If this little fucker can push through their defenses, then so can we. So let's crack on. Dec. We're gonna get these hostages. You're in command till I get back. Why'd you help that man break inside the train? I didn't. I was helping the little girl like you asked, and then a man unscrewed the toilet. Hmm. Are you his wife? I'm not married. You're lying. Look what he did to my face. This isn't her phone. Just FYI. Where is your real phone, hmm? Lover boy call it to arrange your escape? I didn't try to escape. - Where is he? - I don't know. Take her to the toilet and find her real phone. And stay professional. Stay professional. Have you found her real phone yet? Not yet. If I didn't know any better, I'd think you were the player. I'll take that as a compliment. How long have you been dating? Never met him. But if you could be kind enough to introduce us, I'd love to take him out for dinner. He's starting to sound like my type. Is it through? It looks like we have the clearance. Find Grace and tell her we're through. I'll get started on the device. Roger that. Cute. - Found your phone. - Fuck. Careful. Hello, Grace. Can I offer you a drink? Ooh, yeah, I'll have... I'll have a glass of champagne. - So where are the hostages? - Hmm? Oh, they're not going anywhere. So why are we here? You probably thought that was gonna be you. Actually, I thought it was gonna be you. I know that's what you're here for. So, let's try this again, shall we? - Grace Lewis. - George Clements. Calm down. We have a lot to discuss. No, we don't. You hired us to do a job. Yeah, you didn't do it properly. You said clear the village, and we did. You fucked up. You left witnesses. They were supposed to spread the fear. They spread the fear alright. Did it work? Did any other village ever refuse to sell you their land after that? Answer me. No, the pipeline went through. Low-intensity ops. It's a nasty business. But it's fucking effective. Your friends wrote the textbook for it. Well, perhaps you should have read Chapter 10. "Kill Kids With Mobile Phones." Or the prime minister could just admit that he hired us. Clearly he ain't gonna do that. Then clearly we have to get paid. Payment can be arranged. Britgaz has got... A pipeline in the Channel Tunnel. Not many people know about that. My father did. If you don't pay us, and guarantee safe passage, I will destroy this tunnel and... everyone in it. Do you understand? If you well and truly fuck off, I'll get you your money, and your safe passage. Agreed. But I want wire confirmation in the next 30 minutes. OK. - You get that? - Loud and clear. All call signs, the device is in position and the anti-tamper triggers are set. Stand still. Pull the trigger and I'll detonate. Suicide bomber, are you? Well, we're all about to get dead anyway. The ones that survive, enjoy. Not much joy in this job, mate. We either get we want or we fuck you up severely. Hijack a train under 75 meters of rock, death is the most likely result. And you and everyone else in this tunnel will burn along with us. Drop it. Eurostream officials have so far refused to say how many passengers are involved, but reports claim that British, American, French and dozens of other foreign nationals are among the hostages. Sources in Whitehall say the prime minister's come under increasing pressure from the presidents of the United States and France to resolve the crisis. So he's called an emergency session of Cobra. Sir Charles Whiteside from Britgaz, Prime Minister. Thank you for coming. So what does your board have to say? We've agreed your 500 million. A bargain, really. Of course, this stays out of the public domain. Britgaz doesn't pay ransoms, do we? Understood. Thank fuck you're still alive. Grace is gonna blow up the tunnel. Yeah, yeah, she made the same threat to Clements. It's not a threat. I found the device. - Next to a gas pipeline. - Well, can you disarm it? No. It has anti-tamper triggers all over it. Tell Bisset to get the team in there now. Bisset's dead, mate. - What? - Grace zapped him. Christ. You have control? - Yeah. - Then launch the ER yourself. Clements ordered us to wait out. What, and let Grace blow up the tunnel? Britgaz just agreed to pay her. She'll trigger the device anyway. This isn't about money. It's revenge. Yeah, I know, and if I was in their shoes, I'd be thinking the same thing. But setting off a bomb in the Channel Tunnel, it's suicidal. She's operating as if she's already dead. Yeah, well, if she blows the tunnel, she'd better hope Lewis taught her how to swim out. That's the real question, mate, how does she plan to escape? Listen... Tom, mate, just, um... find a way out of there, alright? 'Cause, I'll be honest, I need your help, mate. Yeah. Sophie needs it more. Look, I get that you're in love and all that. - I do. - No. I just got it now. Yeah, alright, mate. Are you gonna blow the tunnel? You sound awfully ungrateful for someone who just got promoted. I agreed to help you escape. But taking a gas pipeline hostage was never part of the plan. Declan, you're just a tiny part of this operation. Actually, no, I'm a mission-critical part. Assuming you wanna get out of there alive. We're already dead. And you will be too if we don't kill this player. He's one of yours, isn't he? I've got him under control. - The fuck you do. Where is he? - I don't know. You must be in contact with him. Yeah, I am, but I don't know where he is. Let's start with his name. Tom. Look, I did not sign up for this. None of us did. So either you help me kill Tom or I tell Clements you're the snide. Tom's girlfriend's on the train. Tom! Tom! Under train. Same as before. Tom, it's a trap! Drop it. Sophie! Tom. Was it something I said? She'd never leave a casualty behind. How sweet. You know Sophie so well. The only reason I'm down here is because of her. Sounds like the simplest thing is to offer yourself up in exchange. Then we'd have to trust each other. Let her go. Once she's gone, so am I. It's not in our nature. We're more alike than you know. I don't recall torching any villages. How many people have you killed? How many? - I don't think about it. - Neither do I. Don't think about it. Don't dream about it. So he switches on and he kills people. And then he switches off and he takes you to Paris. - How romantic. - I'll do it. Well, there's only one way to end this. What are you doing, Tom? What are you doing? Tom! Run, Sophie, run! Shit. We're hearing reports of an explosion near to where a Eurostream train was hijacked. The SAS counterterror team is at the scene, and it's clear the situation has become extremely dangerous now. ABC, CNN also transmitting. Well, where the fuck is Clements? Quiet! Quiet down. Answer it. This is Sergeant Smith. I'm the new ground commander. What was that explosion? That was your man trying to rescue his girlfriend. Try that again and I'll torch the entire tunnel. Your money's ready for transfer. Britgaz just confirmed it. I'll need an outside line to verify that it's reached the account. Opening now. Eurocopter is fueled and standing by. End the call. - That's it. It's uncoupled? - Yeah. Well done. The passengers are consolidated and we have the money. Wire everyone their cut, including Declan. I was aiming for soft tissue. What about the player? It'll take too long to put the fire out and confirm him. We should assume he's still in the battle space. Come on. Right, Olivia, set up our control point over there. Yeah, boss, I'm on it. I've got three sniper positions and my team's looking for one more. - Right. - Hey. You know, I can drop all of 'em before they get to the heli. Just give me the word. Tom'll have his day. Dec. You alright? - Yeah, I'm fine. Course. - Paddy. I like your hoodie. Take it off. Now. Help! Shh! Up you go. All call signs, this is Alpha. The train is two minutes out. Call the heli in. Papa 1-4, this is Alpha. All clear. Call in now. Papa 1-4. Roger that. On approach. Put the fucking mask on. Move! Gas. Get inside. Setting the anti-tamper triggers now. Wait. OK. Come on, get in. Get in. Olly, get the other sled. Sophie! Go. I'll take care of him. Dad would be proud. All call signs, Alpha has Eurostream. That's the cockpit unmanned. On autopilot. Slowing. Slowing. Slowing. Stop. That's Eurostream static. If you have Grace, take the shot. I thought she had safe passage. Change of plan. If you can target her, take the shot. This is Alpha. All Sierras stand by. We're gonna drop the Swans. Stand by. Stand by. Possible Swans in Coach 19. Sierra 5. Swans, Coach 19. Confirmed. Remember what we agreed. Do what I say when I say and we all get to go home. Now, get your hoods up. All call signs, this is Alpha. That's the hostages exiting the Eurostream. Sierra call signs, we need eyes on Grace. Eyes on Grace. All call signs, is Grace sighted? Sierra call signs, I repeat, does anyone have eyes on Grace? Sierra 5. Grace unsighted. Possible Swan. Blue on black. Possible Swan. Grey on black. Sierra 3. Possible Swan. Red on black. Sierra 1. Female Swan. White on green. Swans are confirmed, sir. - What about Grace? - Unsighted. All call signs, I have control. Stand by. Stand by. Stand by. Go. All call signs, this is Alpha. All targets down. All targets down. Red 1-6. Do you have eyes on Grace? Red 1-6, Grace unsighted. Still checking. Out. Move it that way. Move it that way. Tom! Sophie! You know I'll do it. You have your money and safe passage. Just let her go. We still have more to do. Alpha. The device has detonated. All call signs, I repeat, the device has detonated. Clear the area now. Red 1-6, do you have eyes on Grace? Red 1-6. Grace unsighted. I say again, Grace unsighted. Looks like Grace did a runner. Again. You fucking snide. Shit! This is Alpha. Second explosive detonation inside the tunnel. Strength ten. Contact with UK SF control point terminated. Killing me won't stop Tom. Perhaps this will. Sophie. Don't worry. This will stop the bleeding. Pull. Tom, drop her. - What? - Tom... I understand. Drop her. Go. Shit. You. You've got a decision to make. Choose wisely and I'll help you sort this out. Mate, I've seen the way you sort things out. You don't give a shit about anyone, let alone a fucking snide. I give enough of a shit to find you. And fucking kill you. Yeah, well, when the world finds out what you've been up to, they'll be coming after you, not me. You cunt. So we're just hearing that Grace Lewis has claimed responsibility for hijacking the Eurostream train and the related explosion in the Channel Tunnel. She has uploaded a statement online using various social media channels. Let's listen in. By the time you watch this, I'll be dead. And I'm here to tell you why. My father taught me all about these. This one carries gas to homes across the UK. People are always complaining about the cost of heating rooms, heating water, heating pizzas, for their fat kids as they sit on their fat asses mesmerized by reality TV. They don't know the real cost. None of you do. Until now. You said clear the village, and we did. Well, you fucked up. You left witnesses. They were supposed to spread the fear. They spread the fear alright. Did it work? Did any other village ever refuse to sell you their land after that? Answer me. No, the pipeline went through. Low-intensity ops. It's a nasty business. But it's fucking effective. Your friends wrote the textbook for it. Well, perhaps you should have read Chapter 10. "Kill Kids With Mobile Phones." Or the prime minister could just admit that he hired us. Clearly he ain't gonna do that. Well, then clearly we have to get paid. Payment can be arranged. Britgaz has got... A pipeline in the Channel Tunnel. Not many people know about that. If you don't pay us, and guarantee safe passage, I will destroy this tunnel and... everyone in it. Well, Grace Lewis has made some extraordinary allegations against the British government. If these are proven, the implications for the prime minister and the United Kingdom will be huge. Good luck with the second term. Nicely played. It's not a game. Yes, it is, and you enjoy it. Always have. If you were to drop me right now, would you think twice about it? No. I'm the same way. It's a gift. A gift we both share. A gift? I reckon most people wouldn't see it that way. Most people are weak and filled with doubt. Maybe. But they still... They still deserve... Love? I've never loved anyone in my entire life, and neither have you. That's not true. Not any more. Tom, Sophie will eventually leave you. 'Cause she will never understand who you really are. She understands now. You... are rare, and special. Let me help you embrace who you really are. A true Black Swan. You're right. I am. You OK? If you ever wanna talk about it up here... Actually, there's something I've been meaning to ask you. Is that why you wanted to go to Paris? Will you marry me? If I thought I could make you happy, I would. But, Tom... you're not meant to be married. I know that now, and so do you. - I thought you understood. - I do. Sophie... Oh, my... Are you...? It's news to me as well. I love you. Please, marry me. A Red Notice has been issued today for former SAS commander Declan Smith, who's wanted in connection with the bombing of the Channel Tunnel. At the time of the attack, Smith was a senior member of the counterterror unit tasked with resolving the crisis. He now stands accused of aiding and abetting Grace Lewis, the main perpetrator. Declan Smith is the subject of an international manhunt to track him down. Security sources suggest he's the only surviving recipient of the ransom allegedly paid by Britgaz in a failed attempt to prevent the bombing. The money, reportedly half a billion dollars, is also missing. A spokesperson for the victims has been scathing about Smith, telling us they believe he's sitting on a beach somewhere, spending the ransom money. However, opposition groups have called him a hero for what they say is his battle against institutional corruption. They've repeated the claim, first made by Grace Lewis, that it was the British government that ordered a massacre in the Republic of Georgia to pave the way for a gas pipeline. Britgaz, one of the UK's largest corporations, has denied those allegations and expressed its sympathy for all the victims. Its chairman, Sir Charles Whiteside, had refused to make any further comment until today, when he phoned in to our studio for this exclusive interview. Sir Charles, what's your response to the Grace Lewis video, which implies Britgaz was willing to pay the perpetrators for their silence? Clearly the video was constructed by this Grace Lewis in a pathetic attempt to deflect attention from her crimes. So you'd support a full investigation into the attack and these claims? Yes, as it would reveal the inconvenient truth: our own security services were betrayed, and this led to a tragic loss of life and property. Are you referring to former SAS commander Declan Smith? I'm aware that a Red Notice has been issued for a man by that name, and I look forward to seeing justice done. Victims of the Eurostream attack have speculated that Declan Smith is sunning himself on a private yacht or villa somewhere, using your money. We have expressed our deep condolences to the victims but must state very clearly no ransom was paid. Fallout from the bombing has intensified as sensational scenes unfolded in the House of Commons today during Prime Minister's Questions. Atwood was asked if the bombing that brought down the Channel Tunnel would bring down his government. Let's listen in. Order! Order! I will have order! You're a disgrace! The prime minister, like every member who has the floor, is entitled to be heard. Let him speak! The prime minister. Resign! Thank you, Mr Speaker. And, yes, I must confess to complete disappointment that my Right Honorable friend has used the PMQs to spread false rumors and lies about these tragic events. It's very clear the real traitor, the real traitor, is former SAS commander Declan Smith. Will the prime minister... - Oh, sit down! - No, I will not give way. - Sit down! - Order! Will the prime minister take responsibility for this security failure and resign? My Right Honorable friend, I am. I am taking responsibility. I'm taking complete responsibility for finding Declan Smith and holding him to account in a British court of law. I, Dr Sophie Hart, take thee, Thomas William Buckingham III, to be my lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, in war and peace, knowing that in war, your crazy brain is always right. And I will never wonder what you get up to in the loo again. Trust me, you don't want to know. I, Thomas William Buckingham III, take thee, Dr Sophie Hart, to be my lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, in war and peace, knowing that in peace your prognosis will always be right. Also I'll never freeze your dead cat again. A very wise decision, sir. By the power vested in me by the local mayor, who you generously supported in his re-election campaign, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. Oh, fuck. Took him long enough. Go on, then. Yes, boss? Are you married yet or what? - Just. - It'll all end in tears. I'll give your love to the missus. Hey, I've got a wedding present for you. You found the money. Right where you thought it'd be. And Declan? That cunt is sitting on it. Alright, stand by. Wanna take a rain check on the honeymoon? Yeah. Drop him. You sure? I never liked that little fucker. Drop him. All call signs, this is Alpha. I have control. Stand by. Stand by. Go.
