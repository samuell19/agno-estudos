- Order up! - Waitress... Oh, waitress... - What's wrong? -This glass is stained. Shelly, it's just water spots. Do you sterilize your glassware here? - It's been washed. - It looks like it's been washed a little... - Brenda, we came for breakfast, not for AIDS. Paper cups, please. I have styrofoam. - That's fine. - Styrofoam? That causes cancer. Wait a second. What else do you have. We have straws. Plastic or paper? I asked for half decaffeinated coffee. Half decaffeinated and half regular. That's not half decaffeinated. That's at least three-quarters regular. Three-quarters? - I'm hypoglycemic. Oh... - Shelly, just order some Postum. Listen, I'm sure you didn't do this on purpose... But there's a hairline crack in this plate, and that's one of the major reasons for the spread of botulism. Botulism? - Botulism. Can I help you? - I don't know, can you? Ha ha. What can I get for you? I don't believe it's on the menu... What do you want? - Coffee. Do you have coffee? Yes, we do. - Oh, splendid. - And what is this? Oh! I don't know. It's so sanitary, so individually wrapped, it's so... How do you say? So American. I don't like. No, I don't like individually wrapped packages of sweetness from Sweet 'N Low. - There you go. Wish I had some Sweet 'N Low right now... -God... Tough day, huh? Why don't you slow down? -Take a breath. Maybe a little thought might prevent a lawsuit. Not everyone's as nice as we are. - That's true - I guess I'm just lucky. A blizzard falls from a clean paper cloud... -This guy stinks. Onto the corrupt and greasy table top world. A twirling, swirling, quasimorphic mass that leaves all beneath it... Soft... and pure. And what is this? It's another present from our antiseptic Santa! It's long and thin... Doesn't rattle... It's... It's... Oh! It's a straw! Why, whatever for? Unless... Wait a minute! This isn't sugar! They're trying to set me up! Ow! Waitress! Waitress! Oh, shit... What? - Calm down. Calm down, calm down. You don't have to man-handle me. I know when I'm not wanted. -You big brute. I'm leaving. It's OK, you big beast. - Yeah, you think you're so cool, huh? Hey, fuck you pal! Fuck you, you big faggot! Fuck you! Hey. What are you staring at, huh? Don't you have anything better to do than follow me? You guys are crazy. You're all fucking crazy! Get away from me. Just leave me alone. Just... go! Leave me alone. Just go away! Look at this one. - What? New troll. - Lovely... lovely. - What's with those teeth? -They're ridiculous. Yeah, but why's he wearing them? - Why does he talk to the sky? - Do you think it's a disguise? - I think it's not worth worrying about. Can I check him? OK. Run a search. You never know. All c-- --razy! Look, just leave me alone. Just go somewhere else. Leave me a-- Nothing. - Nothing in his file? No file. -What? No birth, school, prison, medical, army, employment, welfare... Nothing. I've never seen a blank before. - I guess it happens. The guy's not too tied in, if you know what I mean. Clean him. Tag him. Start a file. - Wild... no file. What a gonzo. Hey. Hey, I need this. I need it. - What are you doing? You're making a big mess! Hey! Don't worry about it. I'm a cop, OK? - Yeah, right. This is disgusting. Sick. - Whatever, dude! We got a stationary on that new file. - Location? Just a minute... Broadway and 5th... Alley behind the Burger Joy. By a dumpster. No... In a dumpster. In a dumpster... - Right? That's how he slipped through the filing system. Consumption data is a primary reference... - Eighty percent of current file data. He's moving again. - Even the basest trolls have to eat. So we pick up the easy ones through food stamp records. The rest we get through standard outlet surveillance... Food lines, restaurants, supermarkets. Everyone buys groceries so we pick them all up. But not this one... He's pure. He lives on nothing but garbage... He sleeps in garbage, he wears garbage, so of course -- what does he eat? - In a word... Crap. Ciucc. Bullshit. - No, no, no, you can't be afraid. I mean, people are always afraid. - You've got to learn how to break out of the shell of what's expected. - I mean, when I was young, I used to peek in at my parents' Cocktail parties, right? - I couldn't believe that all these people got to the same room, and all they did... Was stand and talk. - ...but this past year, she's been concentrating on the gentrification of the inner city. - I mean, why didn't they jump? Why didn't they play? Why didn't they do something? - The whole indigent displacement factor. - Now, here we are. I mean, it's like a nightmare come true. I was fascinated by your approach to the link between premenstrual syndrome and school prayer. - We've got to do something! We've got to break out! Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry. Here, let me get that for you. - Leave me alone. Look, let me get some water... OK? - Leave it alone. Leave it alone! Well who invited you, anyway? - Leave it alone! No really, George, it's nothing to laugh at. - Look, it's an intestine! Well, he's gone and he's got a bit of a reflection. It's, again, that schizophrenia... That male/female-ness of this thing, now certainly it wouldn't go as... Art? Never! But nevertheless, it shows a disturbed mind. - Well I think you may be right about that. - ...in an objective, non-judgmental format. More on the lines of how Deb approached the incest problem. Hi. - Hi. I'm Deb. - Hello I, uh, don't think that's possible. - I know how that stood you on your head. - Have you noticed the beautiful sunsets we've been having lately? Strange phenomena! It's caused by the uncommon persistence ofVeluvian Front, which, ordinarily... would be pushed further south by the cooler subpolar influx, during this time of year. What you say may be incomprehensible and boring, but that doesn't make it true. - What a bear. - Yes, it was difficult. But it's empowering, too. - To decimate the decaying pretense of social order. - You know, I think that's how it got started for me. It was this peeling away, trying to get closer to my own personal power center. I helped her peel. -The thing that annoys me about this one... ...is the fake transcendence. - Summation in one word is a great, resounding "trash." - Trash? Wait. Before you call it trash... You've got to try and understand it, see? The beast walks through a wild world... Propelled by his own dreams. Here, the spring. New life. Here, the harvest. All he can see is his cold, rational exterior self. But we can see him for what he really is -- the animal. The biological organism. Closely related to the trees. See -- the veins, the branches. You've got to be able to open your eyes, open your mind... To be able to feel the painting, huh? Trash? -Trash. Excuse me. I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. Now look... This is what's going on. I was just standing here, getting some food... And I looked over and saw you and, I'm sorry, I could see that you were different and... I just want to talk, that's all. - I see it as a prophylactic on the shaft of patriarchal - Patriarcal. Patriarchal tyranny. I'll be in the car. - He seems to have some difficulty between the push and pull of the community... - And the natural surroundings of the... - What did you do, read the goddamn catalog? - You know, it's incredible the impact we've had on each other. - I am? - Well, actually, I haven't had the opportunity to... - Well... OK, I guess. - Look... the man is the same shape as the tree. -The man is cutting down the tree. The man is the tree. I see it. - Well, sure! Once you can detach yourself... We're all a fungus. Right? You look pretty detached yourself. - Well, I was... but I'm back. And I'm going to change things. - Oh, an idealist. You are detached. Well, look at your paintings and tell me you're not an idealist. What's this? - Well, it's a storyboard. Wait a minute, this guy doesn't look like me. - And besides, it's wrong. I don't say, "This guy doesn't pan right." - No, no, no. It works like this. This guy doesn't... look like... me. You're zooming in, see? Pan right is a camera instruction. - Oh, yeah. - And anyway, you don't have to get it exactly right. It's just a sketch. - Which is a good thing. I mean, how would you feel as an actor, or an artist... If every little thing you did and said was dictated by some stupid little... ...card? You've got to break out! You've got to break out! Break out! Come on. - This is weird. - What? That new file. - Are you still on that? Watch. Watch this regional. What do you want? - Coffee. Do you have coffee? Do you have coffee? So American. I don't like. I don't like. Schizophrenia. - Yeah, but it's weird. OK. Pick him Up.Vagrancy. Print him. Hold him. Shake him. You know what bugs me about painting? I'll tell you what bugs me about painting. You can take a canvas, throw it out a third story window, pour paint all over it... pour Spaghetti on it, urinate on it, defecate on it... jump out of a window and commit suicide on it, and it's been done. Fifty times already! - What do you mean, it wasn't him? He traded coats. He shook us. OK. Circulate an all points bulletin. Send out a composite. Tell them to watch for... bums in disguise. I woke up late this morning All alone herein my bed I was feeling kind ofqueasy There was a cloud around my head When I looked up at the ceiling I was torn to see sunlight - People say this is a Mickey Mouse world. It's not a bad idea, if you're an archetype, actually. - Walt's on ice right now. He's not really quite dead. He's dreaming. Walt is the creator. There is an angelic choir. Which is called Walt's staff. Walt's staff is a true staff of power. When Walt the creator decides he wants to create a world, he turns to the staff and says... "Let's create a world." - And a world is created. - It's created for the Mickey Mouse Club. That's the rodent of humanity that's made it this far. - And if you remember Fantasia... the mouse has its hands on the wand right now. It's called technology. Tried to make his job a little easier for him, wasn't ready... Spiritually speaking, for the... Work of this particular tool. And it got out of hand. He's trying to stop it now, but it's beginning to swirl around and around... And I'll be damned if Mickey isn't about ready to drown his ass. And the planet looks like it's going down the drain, but just at that moment -- ba doomp! The sorcerer's returned. So! Speakest of thy quest, O mighty crusader. Wither dost thou jousteth? Quest? What is quest? Come on, man... back at the gallery it was "now I'm back and I'm going to change things." But when it comes time to deliver the details, you wimp out. No... no, I'm sorry. It's not something you talk about. Look! There are two great advantages to sharing secrets with me... A, I don't believe you. And 2, nobody believes me. Huh? That's very funny, but it's not a joke. You think I'm joking? Look! You think I fucking like it back there? You think it's fun painting for blind people? Look... if I think your plan is crazy, I won't laugh. If you want to keep it a secret, I'll die before I tell. Just give me something for fuel. I can't stand people the way they are. Crack the wall. I need some light. Come on, ass wipe. - You know what's sad? I'll tell you what's sad. Sad we didn't drop the bomb a long time ago, when we could have recovered. I mean, think of those guys in Hiroshima, right? Nothing like a good, healthy dose of radiation to turn you into an activist. But now we build them REALLY big! Every day we make them bigger, and bigger... - So obviously -- And it's just so obvious that sooner or later we're going to have to use them. But all this is trite, I mean... How many times have you heard this before? "We're getting ready to end life." And it's trite. Relax. Relax. Things will change. People will think-- -Think? Look at the world! What do you see? Millions of little machines, with hands and feet. Think? You expect them to think? Forget it! It's not the way they're programmed. - It's not the way they're -- They're programmed to accumulate, and procreate, and that's it. That's it. - That's it. That is it. All we have to do is change the program. Gosh, I hadn't thought of that before. Change the program... That's what I want to do with my paintings. Only they don't match the couch. You gotta understand priorities, see? Well, look, I have a -- -Things must match the furniture. I -- - Change the program? Forget it. I have the way. Oh do you just? - Yes. The way is here... In my package. Woo! Goody, goody! Show and tell time! I have a package, too. "The way is here... in my package." What the fuck was that? Everything... Everything that people need, everything people lost. All the things that people never had. The gateway to a greated humanity. -The next step in human evolution. Must have been hard getting the lid shut. Independence of spirit... The ability to look in, to look out, to feel, to think... to see, to be an individual! You know what it looks like? It looks like one of those urinal tablets. You know, they put them in urinals, they smell like raspberries. I like them, too, but I wouldn't carry one around. You call yourself an artist? Don't you even believe in spirit... in magic? In essence divorced from form? - Come on, man... Don't give me this hocus pocus bullshit. What's in there? Hocus pocus? Hocus Pocus? Hocus pocus? - Is that what you call the beautiful magic of life? The mystical spirit that separates us from machines? From robots? - Do you so worship science that you scoff at anything that can't be reduced to some mathematical formula? - Have you closed your eyes to the independent wisdom of the soul? - I offer you dreams of useful science. You like your dreams of canvas and let science rule your life. Well science is a jealous god. So I speak to you in your religion. Listen... I don the robes. What I'm holding in my hand is a drug. A mutant biological organism that has a very specific effect on neurotransmitters of the human brain. That effect is complex, but its objective manifestations can be roughly described... As a heightened sense of perception. From the removal of inhibitions. The effect is gradual and cumulative, and can be heavily observed as a change away from... passive social herd-type behavior, toward independent contemplation and action. No more racism, sexism, or nationalism... Only independent thinking and acting individuals. - I don't know, man... I mean who's going to maintain the sewers? Pump gas? Anchovies -- who's going to can anchovies? Society could crumble, you know. - You said it yourself. The alternative is a dead world. We have absolutely nothing to lose. I plan to deposit this culture in our local water supply. But first I must wait approximately four days for it to reach a critical mass necessary... to reproduce and proliferate. - Once a deposit is made and the culture establishes itself it should be transported and... reestablished worldwide via the handiest of organic containers, the human bladder. Oh yeah? No. I'm lying to you so that you can begin to understand the truth. This? This is nothing. A device, a simple trick to make you pay attention. To free you from your logic. People won't believe in a dream. But this? This lie... -This scientific explanation. This, they'll believe in. And if they believe in this, then the dream has power. Whacko. Just watch. -What I am holding... - ...in my hand... ...is a drug. A mutant biological organism... With a very specific effect on the neurotransmitters of the human brain. That effect is complex, but its objective manifestations can be roughly described... As a movement focusing -- What I'm holding in my hand is a drug. Starker? Starker? It was much too late to stay in bed So I got up right away As I drank my coffee Wait, wait! You gotta know about the oscillations. Oscillations in the evolution of consciousness. Waves... Harmonics... Look! Look! The rise. Egypt. The Pharoahs.The fall. Decline. Then the rise again! The classic age. Fall. - Dark ages. And again, the rise into the modern age. - And here we are right now, on the brink of a fall that could end everything. There is hope... an agent of the new age has found and distilled the essence and it could save us. -This enlightened being is Starker. Starker will release upon the world... The new age. The oscillations. The wave of consciousness. And you just cannot -- Wait! Wait! When I want to be there with you All I do is close my eyes Oh my God! My God, I'm sorry! Jesus, I'm sorry. It's this reaction of mine. I startle easy. I overreact. You know, I don't think. I don't look first. You're not the first person I've clobbered by accident. Oh shit, you're bleeding! Come on. Can you walk? Please say you can walk. - I... Shit, why didn't I take that CPR class? - Look, I'm fine. I'll get you inside. You're not unconscious, are you? How many fingers am I holding up? -Two. Look, I'm OK. I'm so glad. And you don't have any of that internal bleeding? - No. God, medics... We've got a fucking MedicAlert! Rocky, I need help! He's bleeding! Come on in here. Sit down. I'll get a rag to clean this. - I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I can't believe this. I get a ten dollar walk out today, and now this. Christ, it could be manslaughter if I screw this up. - Hey, are you OK? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Where on God's green Earth did he find that neanderthal employee manual, anyway? -The moon? He's a fascist. - Paying for walk-outs... why can't the man take his mid-life crisis to the singles bars like everyone else? I need a place to stay. - Oh, shit. No, look. People out there -- they're looking for me. I gotta find somewhere to hide. Christ, you're not only brain damaged. You're a fugitive, too. No, look. I know it sounds crazy. It is crazy. But I need a place to stay, just for a little while. Look, God doesn't give big problems to little people. You can talk. You can walk. Check out time, we need the bed. - Wait, no... I know, I know, Your lawyer will be in touch with my lawyer. - No, wait. Wait a minute. Susan, right? Susan, I want to pay for the walk out. OK? Take this. Twenty? Now beat it. Wait a minute. What am I supposed to do? I have nowhere to go, I have no more money. I've got this concussion. - What am I, Amnesty International? Hey, I'm sorry. I don't know what you are, but I thought you were someone that could understand. Now please, I need help. - Hey, you got no argument from me there, pal. I'm sure you're on the right track. Rocky, I'll bring in that six-pack for you. - OK. - All right, what do you think you're doing? Have you had this cat vaccinated against leukemia? Oh, it is imperative that you do so. You know, I'd like to have a look at him. If you don't mind. - You would? Yes! I used to be a veterinarian. Well, before my wife passed away. And you see, this cat... This cat looks lethargic. - You know, that's just how she's been -- lethargic. Really? Oh. Look, I'd like to give her an examination. If that's all right with you. All right... All right, get in. How long do you need to lay low, Dr. Doolittle? - Doctor...? Just a couple days. If that's OK with you. I really will look at the cat for you. - Forget it. The cat's lethargic because I just got her spayed. So, uh... Susan. My name is Starker. - Starker? That's a good one. I changed my name once, too. So, Starker... are you a part of a fugitive ring? Or are you alone? I'm alone. Very alone. You one of these new age cowboys? Spiritual Planes Drifter? Well, actually, I... I just got out of jail for... For something you didn't do, right? -Yeah. Everybody's innocent. That's what Jack says. "Nobody did nothin," as Jack puts it. Space men made it happen. Who's Jack? - My husband. Jack. It's like now -- I'm driving this car, but I tell you I'm not. Not of my free will. That my hands are not turning this wheel. That space men are commanding my hands to turn this wheel. Maybe we shouldn't have jails. Maybe we should just sentence everybody to EST training. What's that -- EST? Werner Erhard, taking responsibility, manifesting your own reailty, and all that, you know. - You know, he was into science fiction way before he got people to pay $500 to learn how to cry... - Learn how to let go. Have you learned that? I don't think so. Everybody's doing it. Trying to let go. Walking hand grenades with the pins pulled. Who needs to cry, though? Doesn't like tear a chunk out of you everyday anyway? Just getting up in the morning is a guarantee that you'll be unburdened with something dear to you today. I, for one, never had to let go. Life always pulled it right out from under me. It's like sitting on an assembly line... Only instead of sticking the parts on, they're tearing them off. I just don't see why we need to help the process along, that's all. So, uh... you never had EST training? Sure I have. Hasn't everybody? Mine just didn't take, I guess. But I'm optimistic. I'll just wait for the next program to come along. God... damn this thing. Fixed the lock myself, now of course she doesn't want to pay for it. Come on in. Shit! Be careful. Don't trip. Here, give me this thing. - I got it. Oh, damn it. Just wait here! Come on in. Sit down. How's your head? - It's OK. Hey, do you think you could turn that down. I mean, Jack's sleeping. Oh, Jack's out cold. He sleeps like the dead. Thank Heaven. The poor thing, he takes his work way too seriously. Thank God the man can sleep. Oh, Jesus... I just have to jam my pleasure circuits when I get home. I want to forget I took 9 hours of shit to pay somebody else's mortgage. It's the one luxury that's free... forgetting. Selective amnesia. Is that what you've got? - No. Oh, kitty... honey. Welcome to the hormone graveyard, honey. Oh, it won't be so bad... They were never good enough for you anyway. - So what were you put away for? Murder and rape. Well, why waste tax payers' money? I'd hate to be putting up embezzlers and mail fraud artists. - What are you looking at? Huh? Nothing. Just stay away from the window - What's out there? Is somebody out there? Don't open that... There's nobody out there... Relax, there's nobody out there. - You want something to drink? We've got Bud, Diet Pepsi... Oh, we're out of that. God, what's this? Do you have any ammonia? Knock yourself out, you want that straight up? -That's great, thanks. What do you...? - What? That's why you're looking over your shoulder all the time. It's NARCs! That's why you're so paranoid! - No... Out! Out! Scram, I don't need this. - Hey, I'm not a junkie. Oh, I'm sure you're not -- you're a recreational user. Now why don't you go recreate somewhere away from here? Hey! Look at this. - I can't leave now... Besides, I'm hungry. I haven't eaten in three days. - I'll see what we've got. Susan, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. -You don't scare me. You irritate me. You like Pop Tarts? - Pop Tarts? What's that? Just sit down. Relax. You're making me nervous. So... no Pop Tarts on your planet, huh? Well this is your lucky... Would you please sit down! Just sit down. Do you spend all your free time worrying? Is this your hobby? - No. I've gotten over it. I allow myself 10 minutes a day devoted to worry. That's it. Took a time management course. About all I got out of it. Time management? That's the death to spontaneity. - Huh? OK, Susan... this is what's going on. People are mindlessly building a structure... Ordering, ordering... but they never stop to think about the order. So they squeeze all of the chaos out of their lives. But they need chaos. It's the source. It's the source of excitement, lust, passion. So they squeeze it out, but they can't kill it. So they compress it and they store it... And more and more in deadly concentrations. Containers crammed with chaos... The spirit's secret need. Containers they call war heads. Now they need the bombs so that it's the only way out. But I have another way. I have a solution that will dissolve the structure gently. And that scares them, Susan. There are people out there that would do anything, I mean anything just to-- It's the smoke alarm! God damn that thing... - I don't know why they can't just send somebody over. I am sick of it. I tried to fix it. I can't fix it myself, and Jack's terrible with his hands. He can't even change a light bulb without me. - Let me try it. You know about these? It seems so simple, I mean I'd call an electrician if I thought I'd get the money back. - I'll, uh... just put some in the microwave. They won't toast, but... they'll get warm, anyway. - Here. Eat up. I'll be out in a sec. - Sit down! He didn't show. - Nothing? He didn't show up. - You didn't see anything? Well, there was some guy hassling the waitress but we didn't want to blow our cover, so... - Describe him. - He's about 6' 1", 25 - 30... That's him. - Yes. Yes. - Yes. - Starker. - Starker. - Starker! - Huh? - How's that Pop Tart? - Oh, it's great. But Susan... Hey, relax! There's nobody out there. What you got on here? - Susan, you gotta listen to me. I've been identified. - Hey, it's Praise the Lord Club! You watch this? What? No, Susan -- - Aren't they great? I love these born agains. I've just been identified. If anybody talks to you. Look, they know -- - It's so refreshing, all that enthusiasm... They know who I am. They know who you are. - They're so upbeat, so positive. Susan, listen to me. - I wonder how they got so happy. Did you ever try it? - What? I mean letting Jesus into your heart. No. Susan, listen to me... - I don't think it's as easy as they say. Susan, this is important... try to listen to me. - I tried it. It was a really bad time for me. I thought I'd try anything. Susan, you don't have to look... - But I don't care about it anymore. I figure it's his loss. You don't have to look for Jesus. I have the way. - Don't start. - Susan, I'm not what you think I am. No... you're not waiting 'til now to tell me you're that Cuisinart butcher, are you? Jack will kill me if he finds me cut up into little pieces tomorrow. - Susan, we are in danger. You, me, Jack, this entire planet! You've got to believe me. Believe you? - Yes, believe me that I have the solution, that it's here... That you don't have to chase Jesus. I don't know what you've got. Oh yeah, I know, a solution. To what I'm not sure. But you've never heard of EST and you don't know what Pop Tarts is. Don't you see... - So I'm sorry, as far as I'm concerned you'rejust another paranoid. Don't you see? It's EST, it's this religion conversion, it's the Pop Tarts, it's this shit, it's this shit... It's probably these guys, too. They want you buying that shit, and that's what's got to change, Susan! You know what's got to change? It's lunatics like you shoving your fluoridation phobia down our throats... And dragging us into your acid flashbacks. You just can't tolerate your own insignificance! - No, Susan... So you pump yourself up with a persecution complex. - No, you're wrong... People are following you... well who the hell are they? The IRS, the FDA, the 4H Club? Should we tear this place apart for bugs? What were you? Did you lead a double life? Were you a secret agent in the Elks Club, spying for the Masons? - Susan... I'm a threat to all of that. The saviors, the cults, the manifestos... All the parasites who pacify and deaden us. The carrots that they dangle in front of the donkeys. - Oh, now I'm a donkey. - No, Susan... I can help you understand. Susan... Look atme. You do believe me. I don't believe anything... Except that you're hallucinating and you want an audience for it. Your little melodrama in which you triumph over the powerlessness the rest of us are drowning in. You're just afraid! You can't face the fact that you're just like the rest of us. In the same boat with me and Jack. Isn't that right? You feel sorry for people like us. Like you and Jack? - Yeah... me and Jack. People like us... who eat Pop Tarts and read trash. There's no one in there, Susan. Jack is not visible to the naked eye. Shouldn't shock a wacko like yourself. I'm not shocked, I'm just... - Sorry for me? Don't be. I'm not sorry for me. Other people marry somebody and spend the next twenty years pretending he's somebody else. I just married what I really wanted. Didn't start out like that. I just started wearing this to... eliminate certain problems. I just couldn't get the hang of the modern relationship thing. No infantile emotional attachment, no suffocating possessiveness, just vapid balling. Well maybe I am an attention junkie. It just took me a while to realize what a fossil I was. So I gave up... and put this on. Of course, it made me nervous when people asked me about him. But then I realized there wasn't anything I didn't know about him. And I just fell in love with him more and more. I'm not crazy like you. I know the difference between what's in that room and what's in my mind. I used to call him up at work, just to keep up a front. And then I realized I felt better after I hung up. Jack was everything I wanted. Why should I drag myself back to that wasteland of emotional midgets? My mother always said, "If you're not gonna put a bun in the oven, get out of the kitchen." So I hung on to what I wanted. Someone be here now and stick around. Somebody to love me... Somebody to cheer me up. Somebody to say, "hey, come back here, I need you." Sick, huh? - Susan... there's no one in there. There's your bunk. We're sleeping in tomorrow. Please don't disturb us. Are you OK? I'm so tired, but I can't sleep. You, too? I was just Iying here thinking how afraid I used to be before Jack. Then I was thinking the really scary thing is something else. The really scary thing is that there are people walking around out there who aren't scared. They're not scared. They're not nervous. They're not... paranoid. They're not anything. It's frightening. I'm still scared. There's nobody out there, really, is there? - No. Have you read The Joy of Sex? - No Good. Pick them up and squeeze them, one at a time. Start with the dish washer. What did he know? - He said the guy came back. Picked up some kind of package. Package? What was in it? - He didn't know. Said the guy just showed up, said he was a cop. - Fished it from the trash. Cop? Sir... the guy eats garbage. - Prioritize it. Move it to Alpha 5. I'm moving six teams in your sector. Yes, sir. Six teams? Nothing. Where is he? What's he doing? We've got hawks, UV snares, farthing scans, fish ears, and we get... nothing. What's he doing? What's the story on that new file? What's going on? So far the corelation index doesn't cross reference, but we are pulling a double bank inquiry. What we have here erratic schizoid behavior which will fall into standard oscillatory reccurrences... when the period of observation reaches the period of behavioral oscillation, which in a case such as this... Is unusually protracted and obscured by environmental perturbations. We can't find him. This? Oh, it's a straw! You can't find that? It won't be long until the behavioral subharmonics are correlatable to the Fourier modulation. Sir... - All we have to do is run a -- Sir... From what we've seen, the guy just doesn't seem worth the trouble. You think this guy Starker is nothing? You're right. He is nothing. He gets nothing out of life, so he fixes on some trinket, decides it's precious. It's ridiculous. But it's dangerous. There's billions of losers out there, each one dying to believe they're unique, special. One guy says he's found the way. That's how it starts. Communism, aerobics, religion, EST, vitamins, science, urban planning, panty hose... Everything! Anything to distract them from the fact that they're bored, meaningless, impotent nothings waiting to die. Your job is to watch the fixations. Where do they come from? Some guy wants to make a buck? That's OK. That's productive. But there's whackos out there. Whackos. Guys so lost in a dream, they don't care about food, about sex, about comfort. Nothing. One idea, one fixation, from one whacko can fuck up everything. Look at Christ... Oh, now Christ means a car, a family, a steady job. That's OK. That's productive. But when he was first out, Christ meant abstinence, disarray, squalor. It took four hundred years to turn it around. Look at Karl Marx -- two hundred and fifty fucked up years to go. This guy Starker is nothing. His little bag -- it's nothing. But he worships it. That's dangerous. That could spread. Find Starker. Find his little bag. Smash it.That shouldn't take long, should it? Find him. Now! - Good afternoon. Swivel up, please. That's it. Perfect. What's that? - It's an extract of human placenta. You see, older skin cells become thin... Sort of deflate, losing their elasticity, making your skin... Tough, stretched, and wrinkled. This, the other lotion, and the tablets that I gave you... Will re-enable your skin cells to absorb the lipo-proteins that give it that... Youthful, plump vitality, and elasticity. Can't you understand? This isn't just cosmetic. I'm losing function. Look. - I can take care of that. Don't worry -- we have a new procedure. There's got to be something we haven't done yet. You know... something we haven't picked up. Wait a minute! - What? It's so obvious! I know how we can get him. - What? And it's right in front of our faces. Come on! Double-O Seven! Hey, Double-O Seven. Hey, Man From U.N.C.L.E. Hey, where's that old Crusader Rabbit spirit, huh? I kinda liked that save-the-world spunk. Hey, what do you... Hey, come on. Come on, Mr. Rogers. It's time to check out the neighborhood. Why don't you go talk to Jack? He's a good man. Maybe you can work things out. There is no Jack. Read my lips: No Jack. There's nobody in there. And there's nobody out there, either. There's nobody out there, but that doesn't mean it's safe, I mean... This is not Disneyworld. Maybe there's not spies chasing you, but... You've still got your communicable diseases. There's meter maids... There's balloon payments... There's credit checks! It's a jungle out there. Honey, if you want persecution, this world is your oyster. Hey, you did learn to relax, though. That's good. It's really good. And you did it all by yourself, too. Without a burnout Workshop or anything. 'Cause you're motivated. You've got ambition. Honey, Jack was a good man. Just like you said. The best. But I left him behind and I'm doing all right, aren't I? And you can do it, too! Maybe it's just your threshold for terror is too high. If you could just get it down a little closer to mine. Crossing the street can be a nightmare. I want you to go out and get us some groceries. I got a list. Now I want you to take this and give them hell. And remember... those checkers will always try and charge you twice. Don't let them get away with it. Jack... The reason we're having so much trouble with this guy is because he's so... cold. We could track him if he had any kind of a pattern, but he doesn't. It's strange, the guy's got no attachments, no habits, no needs. There's got to be something, though... some soft spot - You kind of have to admire the guy. How can he make it? - We all have something. Our family, our friends... something. - But he... he gets by on nothing. - How could he be that free? No human needs... - No weaknesses. No feelings. Nothing. - So what do you do in a situation like this? There's really not much you can do. Of course you keep looking for patterns, because there's some chance that one might appear. Basically, you just sit back, batten hatches, and wait for the guy to bring himself out. So what do we tell the director? - Wejust present it like it is. So far, the data's all noise, no signal. No recurrent behavior, no attachments... No soft spots. Superman. Wish we could train people that way. -They'd be useless. They never have time to do anything complex. People like that are crippled by their own independence. They have no meaning. They're just... dancing in the void. There are 380 independently operating and controlled servo units. Each activated by impulses from you own original nerves. It can exactly duplicate any motion of the human hand. It's fabulous. Is this fun for you? Is this a pleasant little experiment? Listen! This is my life you're playing with! My life! And this... This is ugly. This is... monstrous. Can't you see? I'm trapped. - But you're not. I've developed something completely new. - Something that will free you from all this. Sir? - What? The Starker file update. - Forget it. - Starker's not important. Time is the enemy. Death. I can't take it... I can't take it. - You don't have to. Look, that's what I'm trying to explain. Everything you think, everything you are, is simply electrical activity in the brain. Electrical activity in the brain... Electrical currents induce magnetic fields. Magnetic fields induce electical currents. It's so simple. Only three steps. One -- precisely record, very precisely record and amplify... All magnetic activity in your brain. Two -- neutralize all the activity in the receptor's brain with a massive magnetic surge. Three -- induce current in the receptor's brain using the fields we recorded from yours. One, two, three... bingo. All your mindset, all your thoughts transferred... - To another body. You will have new life. Don't you understand what I am saying? New life! Bruno, to your Station... Natasha, prep the receptor, please... Thank you. - Now pass the recording device, please. -This device must take a sort of instantaneous snapshot... - of the fields induced by your mental activity. -The reason that the duration of the recording must be as brief as possible... - Is to prevent a blurring of the resultant image... - Which will be developed and stored in the S.S.T.S. - Until it is transferred to the receptor. Remember... One: record. Two: erase. Three: transfer. Record, erase, transfer. Ready? One! Activating, activating... - Coming to power... Contact! Watch the screen. There! - All your present thoughts, both conscious and unconscious... - Your hopes, your dreams, your fantasies, your fears... - Everything you mentally are, is being recorded and stored... - In the Synthetic Storage and Transfer unit. Two! No... too much current! - We've lost the receptor! - Wait... wait, it's all right. We still have your print. Your print's fine. - It's degenerating! We can't hold this print much longer. We need a receptor, quick! - Who? Anyone! Now! Two! Three! Let me out... Let me out. It worked... It worked! Let me up. It's OK. Let me up. It worked! I made it... I made it! - It worked. I made it. I knew you could. I'm here! Nothing. It's better than you said. This is new life. Nothing... Shut up! Who is he? - Get her out of here! Who is that asshole? What's he doing in my chair? - Get her out of here! You morons! You bastards! It's me! Let go! Let me go! Nothing. Nothing... I have a solution... No more racism, sexism, or nationalism. It's a gateway to greater humanity... The next step in human evolution. Time to wake up. Wake up. Wake up. A man like you shouldn't be scrumbling around in the garbage like this. - You're an important man.The world needs you. - I know people like you. You're the paranoid, uncritical, and impulsive methods... Of the irrational knowledge based on the interpretive critical association... of delirious mental images - In relation to your belief systems What a schmuck! What a sap! What a loser! What a limp-wristed twit. - It's the newest generation of prosthetics. - Completely self contained, no bulky support systems. The whole line is ready to install. And they're effective, too! Here, take my hand. Squeeze. - Some kind of movement... Movement? Yeah. It seems to be growing. It's like a massive cult thing. Like in India or something. Millions of people actually believe in it. When is it supposed to happen? -Tomorrow morning. He's supposed to release it into the water... some substance that's supposed to change life. -They're really beginning to believe it. Crumbling... Look... we're so close. Total control of life. Not now. The structure can't crumble now. Put all surveillance on him. Spread the rumor... Starker doesn't exist. There is... no one out there. - Hey... Hey, there's nobody out there. It's OK. There's nobody out there. It's all in my mind... What? Pull out the face net. Satellite surveillance. Pick him up on a flight. He can't set that free. Eradicate him. Tell all personnel -- eradicate. He was last seen here! - Six hours dispersal time gives us this area here. We've accessed 167 voyeur satellites. - Each one has the capability to resolve a license plate at a transmission rate of 780 picks per minute. - It prints out a complete transmitted coverage every 90 seconds. - He's already programmed into the pattern recognition file and the Computer can run the whole area in 20 seconds. - That's a total of less than two minutes from activation to location readout. - You couldn't hide a postage stamp out there. All we need to do is wait for daylight. How could he think he could hide from us? How could he think he could hide? In 15 minutes... we'll have light. There's no place he can hide. Hold off on the satellites. I'll cue you when to activate. There is no place... he can hide. - He is ours now. - Activate now. There's no way. He can't hide. There's no way... I won't! I won't be beaten by some... It's over. - You're all crazy! - You're all crazy.
