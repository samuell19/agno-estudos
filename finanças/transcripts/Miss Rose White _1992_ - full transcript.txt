[Jersey Bounce - Bradshaw, Johnson, Plater] Oh, excuse me. - I'm sorry. - Morning, Angie. - Oh, hi Rose. - I told my cousin Tina that you were looking for a roommate, but she already found a place. - Oh, that's okay. - Dan's arranging for me to get some bedroom display furniture dirt cheap. With my employee discount, I can just about afford it. Mm-hmm! Things are getting pretty serious between you and Dan McKinney. What are you talking about? If giving you inside information on a sale isn't love, what is? Oh, he's such a romantic. Oh, speaking of romantic, Jimmy's taking me to some fancy new place for supper tonight. "All You Can Eat for one price!" Well, you should come with us! Oh, I can't tonight, I'm sorry. Rose, where do you disappear to every Friday night? You got a secret admirer, or what? Yeah, Clark Gable, only don't tell a soul. Yeah, you can count on me. What are friends for? I'll tell you when you're late. Let's go! ...and, uh, no black. Ahh, simple lines; understated tones. Excellent. You've chosen well. - Thank you. - The area opposite the escalator is an important showcase. You’re quoting me. Learn from the best, I always say. Well, it's a good philosophy: It seems to be working. I understand you've been chosen salesgirl of the month for the third month in a row. Yes, ma'am. You've probably heard that Miss Johnson is leaving us, which means that I'll be looking for a trainee for the position of Second Assistant Buyer. I've chosen you, Rose. Me? - Mm-hmm. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. - Uh, tell the girls to, uh, move that off the shoulder "tasette" number before it becomes an antique. - Uh, yes, ma'am. - 'Morning Miss Ryan, Miss White. - Good morning, Mr. McKay. - 'Morning, Mr. McKay. Ready for the accessories whenever you are. Uh, half an hour, Mr. McKay. I'll be waiting. - Oh, Rose? - Come by my office after lunch, please. Yes, ma'am. Psst! Hey. (I got one!) (What?) (I got a promotion.) That's great! Second Assistant Buyer Trainee. Congratulations! Thanks. Walter and Maisie say, "It couldn't have happened to a nicer person." Thank you, Walter, and Maisie. Okay, I've narrowed it down to these two necklaces. Does Walter have a large budget? Well, that's a good question. He's a working man, like me. But, when it comes to Maisie, he would take the stars down from the heavens and hand them to her. I think this is the one. Good choice. Here you go. - Oh, no, you do it. - Walter wouldn't like me being so familiar with his wife. I don't blame you a bit. Missed you at Arthur Murray’s the other night. We learned the Rumba. Oh, swell! What? In your pocket? Look what Walter's got! To orchestra seats to Carousel, tonight. Oh, you're crazy. They just fell in my lap. Buddy of mine broke up with his girlfriend. He has no use for them. 'Pick you up at seven. Oh, I'm sorry, I- I can't. Another date? - No! - Rose, tickets like these don't grow on trees. I know, I just... I can't. Maisie is done. You're beautiful ...Maisie. You're a lucky guy, Walter. Enjoy the show. We still on for tomorrow night? - You bet! - Remember, guys and gals, next Saturday night on Fantasy Ballroom. Your host? Station WNOW, New York. "It started on Jersey Square," "And somebody heard it there." "He put it right on the air," "And now you hear it everywhere." "He put it right on the air," "And now you hear it everywhere." Good Shabbos! Ahh! Good Shabbos. - Oi... - Subway. I'm sorry, I'm so late. Rayzel, what beautiful flowers. - Glad you like them. - Good Shabbos. Shimon and your father will be home from service soon. - Mm-hmm. - And I made gugu. - Ooh, my favorite! - You can take some home. And, they finally got the little pairs I like in the market, for me to dry. Candied fruit like that, you'd never taste. Even from down here, it smells wonder ful. So, did you find a new roommate yet? No, but I got a deal on some beautiful bedroom furniture to replace what she took with her. Good! I'll make you a nice bedspread. And, I decided to give you my soup pot! It's a family heirloom. - Thank you! - Use it in good health. You better light the candles. You should've lit them already: The sun's almost down. Sza! You know I always wait for you. Go on. We have a lot to talk about! (Blessed are You, LORD our God, King of the Universe,) (Who sancified us with His Commandments and instructed us) (to kindle the lights of the Shabbas.) Amen. So, tell me, what's new in the world of high fashion? I have to start planning my fall wardrobe. Tanta Perla, you've been wearing that same dress ever since I can remember! Ah, that's the secret of the elegant woman. You have to find out what works, and stick to it. I'll keep that in mind in my new position. Your "new position"? I knew it. So, tell me. You're looking at the new Second Assistant Buyer Trainee. Mazeltov! Wonderful news. Oh, I knew, the day you drew your first breast pennant, that I would be reading about you in that paper you always talk about. The W-Whittle, uh... - Women's Waydale - That's the one, that one. - And, I'm gonna sign up - for evening classes at the New York University School of Retailing. Rayzel, what I told you seventeen years ago, when you stepped off that boat is still true today! America is the land of opportunity! - Mm, please... - Ahh, imagine, "Chairman of the board, Miss Rose White"! Shh, please! Not so loud! Papa might come in. So, let him. He should be proud of you. You are the first one in the family that is a true American: Educated; No accent; A refined job. So, why shouldn't you be Rose White? Oh, Rayzel, I look at you, and you know what I see? I tell you what I see: I see The Future! Good Shabbos! Good Shabbos, Uncle Shimon! The cantor sang like an angel tonight. I said to myself, "Prayers like that go straight to God's ears." Shimon, where's Mordechai? Here. I thought he was here. If he was here, would I ask you where he was? He wasn't at services. - That doesn't sound like Papa. - Well, now we know where he wasn't, and where he isn't. He left the store early. You were already up here cooking. And? It's like pulling teeth. In our entire married life, the man has never said more than three sentences at a time. What's so important, can't be said in three sentences, hmm? Why did Mordechai leave the store so early? Oh, It must've been the phone call. - What phone call? - The one he got around 2 o' clock. - Who was it from, Uncle Shimon? - I don't know, but he hung up right away, and left. I was busy with two customers. I didn't get a chance to ask. - Hello? - You upstairs? Where should we be? I've got big news, important news! What's more important than services, hmm? God will forgive me this one time. Sit. Everything's ready to put on the table. - I said sit! - What's all the excitement, Papa? Glass of water first. Please. - I'll get the water. - So? Today, at the store, came an urgent telephone call from the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. They want to speak to Mr. Mordechai Weiss, of Brooklyn. That's me. Rayzel, what's taking you so long? Alright, already! I go down, to the immigrant office, and wait with other people, who also wait. Finally, they call me in, and give me these documents from the Red Cross. Rayzel, thanks to God, I found your sister. Lusia? Lusia's alive? Yes. She went from concentration camp in Poland, to hospital in Sweden. she comes here by boat in around three more weeks. She's alive, thank God, - That's wonderful! - It's a miracle! Rayzel? When Lusia comes, she will stay with you. W-with me? With you. I want, you should get to know each other. That's right. You'll have your big sister. home again, darling. Well, it's very exciting, But, I... What? You what? I don't even remember her. When she comes, you will remember. Well, she might feel awkward. Now that I think of it, Rayzel doesn't speak Yiddish very well. Wouldn't it be better if Lusia came and stayed with us? - No... She must learn good English, - and Rayzel can teach her. She has that big, modern apartment all to herself, now. Papa, it's not so big. Rayzel, your sister's staying with you. You will take a vacation from work, and be with her every minute. I can't take a vacation; I just got a promotion today! Your sister's more important. They give you any trouble over this at work, I'll go myself, and speak to them. Or you will quit, because if they don't see the point, then they are no good anyway. Oh, Morde, calm down. - Mordechai, there's no need for this. - What if she doesn't like me? Doesn't like you? "...doesn't like you?"! She is your flesh and blood. A blessing from God, on this family, saved her life. So, no more words from you. Morde, give the child a chance. She hasn't seen her since she was four years old. She was a baby! - Perla... - Perla, you keep out of this. And, you keep Kosher. Like you're supposed to; like you was taught. I want that your sister should feel at home. It's just that I haven't seen her in a lifetime W-We're strangers. It scares me. I gave the immigrant office your number, and they should call you right away when she arrives. Well, me? Shouldn't they call you? - Me, they should call. - Me, from the other side of the city. So, after traveling halfway around the world, your poor sister can sit there, and wait, for another five hours. I'll get her, Papa. Of course. You will get Lusia, and we will be a family once more. Perla, are we going, maybe, to wait till sunrise tomorrow for Shabbos dinner? Mama... Rose, you're coming with me, on Monday, to Lombardi's, to look at the winter line. Thank you. I-I'm looking forward to that. You should be. You should also be slightly terrified. It's a very important day for you; Your first step in becoming a buyer. Be punctual! Wear white gloves. Yes, ma'am. I like the pearls. That's it for me, kids. My heart says, "Yes," my feet say, "No way." Yeah, so do mine. She stepped all over 'em. - Jimmy! I did not. - If you ever decide to leave your job, watch out Ginger Rodgers. Oh, yeah, sure. I can't believe I'm dancing with the Second Assistant Buyer Trainee. Yeah, turn around, and there's a promotion. Turn around, there's Rose White. Well, it's not quite as thrilling as a promotion. You know something? As I grow older, I'm beginning to think more and more that life is just a series of accidents. Some are bad, some are good, but you always have to be ready. I don't think that way. I think, um, life is what you make it. I love dancing with you. It's like we're one person. Yeah, but we're not. We're two very different people. We have a lot more in common than you think. Oh, yeah? Like what? Well, we both work at Macy's, for one. Thousands of people work at Macy's. Oh, by the way, I won't be at dance class this week. Oh, yeah? Where are you going? - Upstate. Family Reunion. - They probably will be waiting for me at the station. They'll be so happy to see you! - Mom will say I look too thin. - My father, he'll have the fishing gear all ready to go, so the minute I unpack, it'll be off to the lake. Aw, that sounds like fun. It's the strangest thing, you know? You feel all grown up and mature, given responsibility and important job, but the minute you go home, what happens? You look at your parents, and you're a little kid again. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Sure I do. It'll be great to see my brother, though. Boy! I can remember when he was just a baby. I should take him fishing. Just the two of us. He plays ball now. God help me: Time goes by so fast! He'll be dating a girl someday... Hello? Yes, this is she, but look: I was just on my way out to work, and I, uh... Pardon me? My sister? Oh, she's not supposed to arrive for another two weeks. Oh, I see. This morning. Um... Well, would it be possible for me to, uh, pick her up sometime this afternoon? I've got a v- very important business appointment that I really can't... W-well, i-is there anywhere else sh-she could wait? No, I- I know she's had a long trip. I... N-No, no! I-I'll be there. Um, can you give me the address, please? Uh, which pier? Twenty-two... Thank you. Yeah, I-I'll be there as soon as I can. Today? Why today, of all days? Hello, Miss Ryan? Uh, this is Miss White calling. Um, I-I'm not feeling very well today. 'Scuse me, I'm here... I was called. I'm here to pick up, uh, Lusia Weiss. "Weiss"? - Weiss. - Just a moment. Excuse, please. Yes? You are, uh, Rayzel Weiss? Yes. I am Lusia. W-welcome to America! Yes. You sure you don't want me to hold your bag? It looks awfully heavy. - Oh, no. I hold. - Oh my goodness, it feels like its 100 today. We get summer days like this in New York, but the fall is really quite pleasant. Oh, it's this way. Beautiful, even. When the leaves fall off the trees, it's just so lovely. Am I talking to fast? Are you having trouble understanding me? No, you speak fine. - Okay. - It's a lovely apartment, it's very comfortable. I was awful lucky to find it. You'll like it. I-I'm sure you will. Come in, come in. It's not very neat, but it's mine. Uh, this is the dinette, and, uh, the kitchen is in there, and this is the living room, of course. Have all this, for alone? Well, I did have a roommate for awhile. A girl from work. But, uh, she got married, and, um, I've been trying to find someone. But, I suppose I haven't really been trying that hard. It's wonderful to have my privacy. It's not easy for you to have me here so sudden. We are like strangers, no? "Strangers"? What are you talking about? I'm not a stranger, we're family. I am sister. Yeah, th-that's what I meant. Oh, you have telephone. Oh, you should hear Papa go on and on about that telephone. "You are a millionaire, maybe? You need that for your private chats with John D. Rockefeller?" He's so old-fashioned, he just doesn't understand what a modern young career woman requires. Oh, I'm just going on and on, and you're probably, uh, hungry or-or thirsty. Um, would you like some juice, or milk, or... A tea! Tea, in a glass. Just like Papa, I-I bet you like it like that. No, water is fine. Please, Rayzel, not to trouble self. - Oh, it's no trouble. - It's no trouble at all! All the appliances came with the apartment. So, here's your water, and, um... Would you like some cheese, or some fruit? I got grapes, and pear, and, uh... - Mm! - Pear! Thank you. - Okay. - Anything you see here, anything you want, you just help yourself. Okay? Because, uh, it's yours too. Oh, no. This very nice of you, but this yours. Not mine, I... Maybe someday, I have mine own. But, this is yours. - No. - Here you go. Why don't I phone Papa? I-I'm sure that he'll be just so happy to know that you made it here safely. - No. - Uh, am tired. He has not seen me in many year. One more day make no different. - Are you sure? I just got... - Tomorrow. Call tomorrow. Tomorrow? But you haven't seen Papa for seventeen years. You don't want to talk to him now? Wait. Okay. It's fine. Well, you probably want to rest, and I-I'll uh, I'll show you where you're gonna be staying, okay? This is the bedroom, and it's a bran new bed. Just a couple of days old. Oh, I cannot take your bed. Where will you sleep? Oh, I'm gonna sleep on the sofa, in the living room. No! I cannot let you do this. No, it's fine. It turns into a bed. Still, it's not... - Eh, I insist. - Alright, then I accept your hospital. "The hospitality." It's- It's hospitality. Well, this English is not easy. Oh, you speak very well. How'd you learn? I study with Mama to come to America. Every night, we read together, back at home. Oh, I see. Listen, I'll run you a bath. Um, a bubble bath. It'll be like heaven, all warm - Please, no, Rayzel. Please... - and sweet smelling, and- and-, - Rayzel, please. - and you can stay in there as long as you want. A long time. 'Scuse me It's your size, it should fit. Please, come out. - No. - I'll be just over there, if you need any help. - Thank you. - It's perfect! It's lovely. You can wear it out of the store. No, no. It's too fine. I see- I see other dress out there. Good for work, plain, you know. And, I... And you can buy two of those for price of this You look nice. When we fix your hair, you'll look just like you were born here. Was born in Poland, like you. Yeah, I know. I just think that you're- you're here now, and you should look like you belong. That's all. When seeing at home, in here, I look like belonging more. I pay back for dresses when I get job. Fine, whatever you want. I feel not good. Oh, I knew we should've had a bite to eat. No no, it's not that. It's in my head. I have not seen my father since I was nine years old little girl. I am older now. What I say to him? He's gonna be so happy to see you! He's been waiting all this time. Yes, I know, but He see me like this sudden, his heart, it, uh, it fail him. He's not gonna have a heart attack. He's a very strong man. Besides, he knows you're coming, he just thinks it's in a week or two. That's all. Please, you go, and telephone to Papa. That's ridiculous! We're standing right near the place. Besides, Papa doesn't take personal calls during his business hours. One of his rules. One of his many little rules. Now, come on. Let's go. Papa, he is still pretty? Handsome? Papa? Yes. Handsome, tall, and very struck. Strict? He's still strict. - Strict. - Rayzel! I remember we dress up good on Shabbos. You, and mama, all of us family, go out together. I remember I see my father's face, and I am to think, "How happy," "how proud!" He don't say nothing, but I see. Do you know this face? No, not really. I don't. - Let's go. - No, I- I, uh, stay out here. You make him prepared. I wait. Okay, if that's what you want. ...and thank you. Thank you, k- - Hello. - Rayzel! What is it? What's wrong? - Nothing. No, nothing's wrong. - Why aren't you at work? - It's Lusia. - She's here. She... Where? She's outside, waiting. Lusia? On the street? You left her on the street? She wanted me to come in here, ant tell you first. She thought it might be too much of a shock for you. A shock? Why? Uh, she's a little nervous about seeing you. Nervous? Did she say something? - No. - What did she say? She- she said nothing. What do you mean? From her father, she should not be nervous. My God, thank God! Lusia? Papa. - It's a miracle. - My God... (My daughter?) My Lusia. [conversation in Yiddish] You have changed also. You speak English. That's good! That's good. - Mama taught her. - Mama, Mama. Do you know, you look more like my sister, Berta. Do you know her? Yes, I- I knew her. We'll close the store for a little while, - Yes. - and have a glass of wine to celebrate! We never close the store in the middle of the day. And who'd be the manager of this establishment? If, uh, if you'll be so kind as to read the sign, it says "Greenspan's Haberdashery." That's me, a-and Perla of course, and I say we close the store, and have a drink to celebrate. Alright, it's your money to throw away. Be my guest. So, look at all this. I want, you should know that this is a wonderful country, but it takes a long time to make a success of yourself. You understand? She understands, Papa. It's important that she should know this. No matter how much you suffer, what you lose before, no matter you don't hardly know no English, you can still be a person with respect, which is worth more than all the tea in China. You understand? I understand. Music. Shimon, let's have music! Music, now. Your sister, she got it all easy. American all the way. Nobody's gonna give her no trouble. Well, I know it's not the same thing, Papa, but I've had to work hard too. With God's help, you got brains and health, so that's what you're supposed to do. Hey, hey, this is a celebration, not a family argument. Come on. Come on, let's dance. Come on, sweetheart. Come on. I dreamed, one day, I would dance with my wife again. That will have to stay a dream. Lusia, you dance with me? No, I am not Mama. Mama is dead! Lusia, Lusia, your papa, it is not his fault. He did all he could to get you, and Mama, out. We all did. - Perla, you don't need to speak for me. - Lusia knows what is the truth. Oh yes, Papa, I know very well what is truth. What are you talking about? I- I don't understand. Nothing, nothing. Now, please, this is a good time. A happy time. Let's drink. Let's be happy. - What are you saying? - - What's happening? - Nothing, sweet. Nothing, darling. Nothing, nothing! - Let's drink! Let's drink. - We were going to drink a toast. We will have a toast. To our family! - To our family! - - To our family. - To our family. It's okay, it's okay. You were just dreaming. It's okay. Shh. Okay... I, uh, I am sorry to disturb your sleep. Please, go sleep some more. - No, no. It's alright, it's alright. - What were you dreaming about? All fire. Everywhere, fire. The whole world burn. Have you ever wondered about why you got sick, and not me? Why I came to America, and you stayed behind? Mama said, was plan from God. God? But she keep boat tickets, even though they no more good. Tell me about Mama. You don't remember her? Why this? You were not baby when you and Papa go away. I know, but I was very young, and Papa, and Tanta Perla, they- they never used Mama's name, or yours. They called you "them". They spoke in whispers about you, and I could only pick up a little bit of- of what was going on. What about letters? Mama write, always. Tanta Perla used to translate them for me, but After awhile, they just stopped coming, and I began to forget, completely. By the time the war came, it was as if no-one had been there at all. Well, Mama, sh-she was very beautiful. She had skin like soft, shiny cloth that... - Silk? - Yes. Like silk. She makes me to laugh. She likes jokes. Her head is always in dreams. "No matter things how bad," "going soon to be better. Mama pray for that. Even after? Always. That was Mama. There's something else I've been wanting to ask you. Lusia. You never call me by my name. "Lusia". I guess I just haven't said it in so long, since- since we were little, since we were all together. You say now? Lusia? Mama, did she... Did she speak often about me? No.... No. Oh, I was just wondering, 'cause- because... It doesn't matter. I think we should get some rest, huh? Mm-hmm. Yeah, goodnight. - Goodnight. - 'Night. ...tell them I want an appointment next week, at 8:30, Monday. - Good morning, Miss Ryan. - Oh, Rose. Come into my office. 8:30, now! I'm glad to see you're feeling better. I wanted to let you know how sorry I am, that I let you down by canceling at the last minute. I can explain my absence. I thought you already had. It was the flu, wasn't it? Uh, no, ma'am, it wasn't the flu. I- I... - Oh, don't bother, Rose. - I saw you coming out of B. Altman's with a friend. Why did you find it necessary to lie to me? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry I disappointed you, Miss Ryan. I want so much to do a good job. It's just that, this last week... Rose, I see good potential in you. I'm willing to forget this episode, but this is your one, and only, chance. Do you understand? Yes, ma'am. Good. I have to go to Lombardi's again next week. I'm counting on you to accompany me. - Thank you. - You're welcome. And, if you must take time off, don't waste it shopping at B. Altman's. Yes, ma'am. Rose, have you heard all of what I've said? Sure. What did he say? Oh, not much. He was definitely non-committal. All I've ever wanted was a home, and a family. I'm counting the hours 'till I can waltz out of this place. Now, someone like you, it's different altogether. You are going to be a career woman, like Rosalind Russel in all those movies. - There you are! - Oh, hi! - Wow, look whose back. - Hi, Angie. - Mr. McKay. - On the other hand, Rosalind Russel always ends up with Cary Grant. What was that all about? Nothing. We were just talking about movies, that's all. How was your visit? - It was great. - But, I missed you. I- I missed you too. - Brought you a present. - Thank you. It's an old family tradition. My grandmother makes them. It's lovely. Thank you. I got a couple things to do upstairs yet. We still on for tomorrow night? Yeah, yeah. - I'll see you then. - Okay, see you then. Lusia, I'm home! I called you at lunch time, but you must've been in the tub. We should probably get going, or we're gonna be late. Lusia? Lusia? Lusia? Lusia? Lusia! Where were you? I thought something happened to you. No, I, uh, went to place. I come to first where you get me. All by yourself? Why? Um, they have list there. I go to read lists in their books. They have every day new names of people they find from the camps. Some coming just now from the woods where they been hiding. But why? What are you looking for? Well, I look to see if there is somebody that I know, from home village, that is alive. And? I see no names I know. I'm sorry. We should probably go. It's a long ride to Papa's. Lusia, are you almost ready? - Mm-hmm, almost. - I'll fix your hair. No, my hair is good. Oh, I'll style it a little bit softer. It'll suit your face. You'll look like a totally new person. - No! - Wh-why it is so important for you to look different from yourself? We should probably go. We're gonna be late. Here you go. They're here, they're here. Finally, we're here. Lusia, - Good Shabbos. - good Shabbos! - Good Shabbos. - Ooh, my, you look so good. - Doesn't she look nice? - What a pretty dress. Rayzel make me pleasant. And, you're getting a little color. My papa, rest his soul, always used to say, [speaking in Yiddish] It, uh, makes the cheeks red. And wait till you taste my challah. My grandmother taught me the trick. You dip a feather in egg yolk, and spread it over the loaves till they shine. I do the same. Mama, also. Oh, the men will be home from service soon. We better light the candles. Lusia, I did not think we would see you again in this lifetime. Please, you light the candles, darling. Thank you. (Blessed are You, Lord our God,) (King of the Universe,) (Who has sanctified us) (with His Commandments, and has Instructed us to light the candles) (of the Shabbath.) Amen. Amen. Look at them, Perla. They take after different sides of the family. Lusia, it's incredible how much you look like my sister, Berta. Ghosts, Papa. You always speak of ghosts. - "Ghosts, ghosts..." - For your information, daughter, we honor the dead by speaking of them. It's enough, already! Can't you talk about something cheerful? "Cheerful." You all are going to be happy, happy happy... It wouldn't hurt. Well, then, I think Lusia should be happy that she's lucky enough to be sitting here. Lucky? Talk! This is lucky? That's not what I meant, and you know that. - If you enjoy speaking of the dead, - Papa, I'll tell you about them. I keep list of family. - Lusia! - Now, Lusia, have some tea, here? - No, no, no. - Berta Weiss, murdered, Auschwitz, sister of Perla and Mordechai Weiss. - We don't need the list. - Marchus Weiss, murdered, Bergen-Belsen, brother of Mordechai Weiss. Zauman and Esther Weiss, and son, Ignatius, and grandchildren, Reyna and Miriam, murdered, Treblinka, cousins of Mordechai Weiss. Luba Eissmann Weiss, - Lusia... - murdered, Dachau, wife of Mordechai Weiss, - Lusia... - mother of Lusia and Rayzel Weiss. Lusia, please, that's enough. One name more, Papa. Not on list, but in my heart. David Pechenik, missing, arrested, Czerniejewo, Poland, son-in-law of Mordechai Weiss, husband to Lusia Weiss. It was such a beautiful day, children playing. Then, twelve days after the wedding, they took David away. And you haven't seen him since? No. I wait for him here, in America. But, after all these years... I know he is alive. How do you know? Oh, I can feel it, here. Mama! Mama, no! Mama! Oh! - Mm-hmm, yes, I fix supper. - Special? You didn't have to do that. - No, - is for to celebrate. Tanta Perla give me job at bakery. You're kidding! - I go early, - when still dark outside, help bake bread, and make nice things, then come home at noon time. Good job. - No, it's a very good job! - Hello? Rayzel? - Papa? What's wrong? - Nothing is wrong. Can't a man telephone his own daughter? Well, of course, but it's just you've never called here before. That's all. Well, there's always a first time. I called to tell you that you should prepare some decent kosher food tomorrow night. I'm coming over with something special. Wha-what is it? You'll find out tomorrow. What he want? Coming over for dinner, tomorrow night. Why? Here? - Yeah. - He's never been here before. Look at this one, Kate. It's gonna walk off the racks! We're doing it in high shades of black. Very elegant, and a price you cannot beat. I don't like this heavyweight gabardine, Henry. It's too bulky. "Heavy"? "Bulky"? I have a guaranteed supply. The same can't be said for the store's customers. We sell 'em too many of those, they'll go straight to the competition. Now, it's getting late. I will take in the suits: 24, not 25 or 26, 27 with modifications... Oh, and no. 19. You're not ordering 34? It's a designer knockoff, Kate. You'll see it on all the magazine covers next month. Rose? What do you think? - Me? - Well, I- I think that those shoulder pads are too military. The war is over, and women don't wanna look like soldiers any more. You heard her, Henry. Do 'em without the shoulders, and I'll take five hundred. Alright, girls, let's go. I'll have a word with Saul, see what he says. By the way, I have volunteered to, uh, organize the Labor Day picnic this year. How many tickets would you like? - One, please. - One? Angie Sergente's ordered eleven. It's a family affair. - Oh, no, I'll be going by myself. - What about your sister? H-how did you know about my sister? - "How did I know?" - I called your apartment, this morning, to tell you that the Lombardi appointment had been changed to 9:30, and, uh, at first I thought I had the wrong number. But then, the young lady with the accent said that you had already left for work, and that she was your sister. She's the one I saw you at B. Altman's with, wasn't she? Yes, ma'am. So, shall I put you down for two? I'm sure she'd enjoy the picnic. Oh, I don't think she'd like to come Well, then how about the whole family? No. No, that's not a good idea. For you, or for them? I- I don't know what you mean. Saul says okay on the shoulders, but only because it's you. The labor costs alone are gonna reduce our profit margin to a big, fat zero. Oh, don't look to me for sympathy, Henry. I've known you for too long. I want you to write up that order for the standard fifty percent of key sale. - Fifty percent? - Oh, drop the peplums on that no. 27 jacket. I don't like it. It's too fussy for the woman in the office today. Now, where do you keep that sludge you call coffee? Over there. It's been a pleasure doing business with you, Kate, as always. - Thank you, thank you. - And, thank you, Rose. - Thank you. - You know, Rose, I was born in Dublin. You were? - And, when we came here, - my father had to sweep streets, and my mother took in laundry. My brother and I were given everything in the world that they didn't have. So, when it came time for my grade school graduation, I didn't want those funny people there, embarrassing me in front of my friends. So, I told them that the ceremony was only open to the students. "The gym was so small," and to this day, I'm ashamed of that hurtful lie. Oh, it's not like that for me, Miss Ryan. Really. I-I'll just be needing the one ticket. Okay. "One ticket for Miss Rose White." - Thank you. - When you were little, you used to love for me to make faces from potatoes. Really? There is, Rayzel, one time, You hold potato like this, and I try to make, um, eyes, for the face. And, the knife slipped and cut your hand. I did it by accidental thing. And, um, you cry and cry and cry, blood everywhere. And Papa, he get so mad. But Mama, she come right to you, and hold you, and she kiss your hand. And she say when you are big girl, and you marry a soldier, that th- the cut will be all... "Healed." - Uh, healed. - Is it true, what Mama said? Let me see. Let me see, let me see here... - I don't know. - I did on here. Here. Tiny little scar. Papa said I got that in a schoolyard, in Brooklyn. Oh, Papa say wrong. Why did he take away the memory? You made a good meal, Rayzel! This fish was a little bit salty, but the eggs was good! Thank you, Papa. I'm proud to have you here. This is for you, Lusia. For you and your husband, when he is found, God willing. Open it. Open it! So you can have a good start in the new country. Where did all that money come from? From the day we arrived here, I saved it. Every week. Was to bring Lusia, and her mother, to America. By the time there was enough, the Nazis came, and it was too late. But, all these years, I've kept it. Take it back, Papa. I don't want it. Why? Tell her. Tell her why. Tell her what happened. I don't know. Nothing happened. - Exactly! - Nothing. Mama is waiting, and waiting. She has such faith, such patience. Then, letter comes from Tanta Perla. She wants to know why Papa won't take the money. But, that letter has nothing to do... What money? - The money some immigrant group - is going to give him, so we should come. But Papa say no. He won't take from no-one. - But, - this you should understand, to owe nothing to nobody! Oh, Papa... A man's dignity, that's all he has. You should've taken the money. "Should have, should have. Should have!" Easy say. The moment you owe something to somebody, you lose a part of yourself. - Look at how Mama and Lusia suffered - because you were to proud to take the money! They offered the money before the troubles! How could I know what was going to happen? How could I know about Hitler? I had a crystal ball, showing Hitler? Every penny I made, I saved so I could bring them to America. I just took enough for food, and clothes for Rayzel. I wore the same suit for seven years. For seven years! Well, each day, we were waiting for you, Papa. But you never send for us! You don't think I suffered too? - "Suffered"?! - Yes, I suffered! Nobody thinks about that. I did not want to come to America with just Rayzel, but you got sick. Remember? Don't you sh... - Remember? You got sick, - and we lose all four tickets if we don't go. And, Mama and I discussed it. We discussed it, and we agreed that you should stay with Mama, and I go first, with Rayzel. We agreed on that, Mama and I. We agreed on that! So, I take Rayzel, and plan to send for you and Mama later. And there I was, all alone in this big city. Me. To derogate my life, I even heated a cup of water. Oh, you compare that with what Mama had to suffer? No, I don't compare that with Mama! I was a man when I came to America. A strong, healthy man. I had feelings, desires. And every night, night after night, month after month, year after year, I sleep in an empty bed. And, slowly, everything inside me dies, till I'm not a man anymore. You never ask what happen to your wife. You never once ask what happen to Mama. She's dead. That's all I need to know. She died. She did not die, she was murdered! Butchered, because you abandoned her! - That's not true. - Papa, she could've lived. She could've lived! When we arrive at camp, I am sick, but Mama, she is still strong. She get picked to go with those who will work, and I get put in line to go to gas. Then, sudden, dogs bark, and guard looks away. Mama, she step quick out of her line, to come beside me. She say, "You are my child. I stay with you." As we march, Mama, sh-she push me deep into ditch, where guards do not see, and she close up space in line. I hear them march away, and I stay there till it is dark, till other prisoner come find me, and help me into barracks. I never see Mama no more. "You are my child." She did not abandon me, Papa! She did not abandon me! Here's some cocoa. - Mm! - It'll help you sleep. - Thank you. - Lusia, why did you come here? I mean, you hate Papa, and we're like strangers. You said so once yourself. So, why did you come? I, um, I come here because I tell David after everything Is over, we meet here in America. What if he doesn't come? Well, he has to. After all hope is gone in the camp, what keep me alive is "David." I live for him, I live for our future. If all the time that I am doing this, he is already dead, then life is like bad, cruel joke of God. He, God, would not joke, make joke like this, no. No, I guess not. I guess not. Rose, my family asked if I had a girl back in the city. Oh, yeah? What did you say? I said, "Yes!" "Her name is Rose White." "She is the most special girl I have ever met." Well, you shouldn't have given your family the impression that we were a couple. Well, aren't we? Well, not exactly... What are we, exactly? I don't know. Come on, w-we're losing it, we're losing it. Come here. What do you mean, you "don't know"? Is there someone else, Rose? Who else could I have so much fun with? Rose, I love you. Did you hear what I said? I love you. Dan, we go out twice a week. We laugh, and we have a good time, and we dance. Can't we just keep it like that? Can't we just have fun together? Fun? Is- is that all we are, "fun"? Maybe I- I have the wrong idea, but I thought there was a whole lot more than that going on with us. Well, I guess you're just seeing something that isn't there, that's all. I think we're in people's way here. - Rose, I love you! - I want to be part of your life. Dan... I worry about you. I went out for a walk after work. I'm fine. You are out so late, and, uh, this is all you say? You're not my father, Lusia. This I know. I make you angry? Everything was so simple before you came here. I knew who I was, and I knew where I belonged. It was simple! Well, soon I will find a place to live, for me and David. Come. I'm sorry about what I said. Okay. I just... I just had this memory. Good memory? Yeah. I was, um... I think I was around three, and, uh, I'd had this terrible nightmare. And, I went running over to your bed, and you said I could come in, and... and we snuggled together for a little while, and... and you told me this funny story about these two mice that lived downstairs in the basement. And, uh, next thing I knew, I was laughing so hard, I'd forgotten all about the bad dream. I remember. - You do? - Can you get it off? No, it's forever. It should not come off. Why? If I let go, who will remember? That is why I am alive. Lusia, I know what you went through during the war is much worse than anything I could imagine, but before then, you were... You were blessed. Blessed? - Yeah. - 'Cause, every night, when you went to sleep, Mama was there, and when you fell down, and you hurt yourself, she picked you up, and told you everything was gonna be alright. Papa didn't hold me in his arms, and.. and he never made me feel like I was his special little girl, and he even robbed me of my memories of her. I... I truly believe that I would trade five years in hell for one day with Mama. Excuse me. - Yes? - I'm looking for information about my son-in-law. Due to arrive today? No, no. He is missing. I need to know if he's found. - Name? - David Pechenik. - "Pechenik." - Pechenik, from Czerniejewo, Poland. No. No, I'm sorry, there's nothing on him. Are you sure? - Yes. - But, the names change every day. Yeah, I know that. We might have more information during the week. Thank you. I'll be back. You look for someone? Yes. Who? My son-in-law. From where? Poland. Czerniejewo. Come with me. What is it? - Shh. - I have lists. Lists? For six years, since beginning, I have lists. Names from camps. Who live, who escape, who die. I copy neat. Hide. Each day, add more names. Show me. So, where are those lists? No, no. I don't give. Not to them, or to anybody. I sell. You sell? You're trading with human lives? Oh, sir, do not get me wrong. Understand... Just get away, wood man. Hey, wait! Wait, wait, wait. I tell you. Look at me. I used to be bricklayer. I build houses. I had family. Now, I am ghost. I cannot even lift a brick. I have no trade no more. My life's work is the list. I sell. - Not to me. - Did I wake you? Is alright. I look at clock, and I cannot believe my eyes! Is almost 12, I sleep so late! - Oh, that's what Sundays are for. - I planned a picnic, but it looks like it's gonna rain, so I thought we'd just have it right here. Here? - Yeah, here. - Is enough for ten people! Well, your appetite is improving. Who'd that be? Who is it? Rayzel, it's me. Papa? You think I got nothing better to do all day than stand here, ringing your bell? No, no. Here you go. What's he doing here, now? - I don't know. - Cheese! Hide the cheese. I'm supposed to keep Kosher. Oh, and ham. Oh, ham. Let's move it. Okay. Is that everything? - I think so. - Milk! Milk... Coming, coming. Hello, Papa. Not dressed yet? - No, not yet. Come in, - come in. Morning, Papa. Good afternoon. What goes on here? - Picnic. - Would you like to sit down? Rayzel was, uh, finish cleaning up the table, so we decide to eat on the floor. So, if I sweep the floor, we will, maybe, eat on the table. W-would you like a glass of tea? No, thank you. I'm here on important business. This morning, I go down to the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. And you find out something? You find... - Patience, patience. - I ask the clerk to take a look at the new lists, but she sees no David Pechenik. So, I'm ready to leave, when starts to talk to me a man. I should say, half a man. Thin, black teeth. He tells me something incredible. What? - What? What did he say, Papa? - That he has lists. Lists of what happen in the last six year in Poland, from back in the beginning of the war. Of course, I asked him, "Show me the lists. I'm looking for my son-in-law." But, he says that he will not show the lists to nobody. That he will only sell. So, I'm furious, and I go away. - Papa! - Then I stop, and I feel in my jacket pocket, near my heart, an envelope full of money. Your money. And, I hear your voice saying, "He needs money for food and cloathe, and" "he suffered. Now he wants to live like the rest of us." So, I go back to him I give him some money... Too much, if you ask me. ...and, he gives me this. ..."David Pechenik" He's alive. He's alive, and he lives in a small village, near Katowice. Still in Poland. Papa, Papa, oh, thank you, Papa. Lusia My Lusia Papa The toilet is in the hall. - Uh, huh. - The room has much dirt, but pay no concern. I clean very well. Yeah, it's lovely. Just needs a little, uh, paint and wallpaper. Ah, David and I... I will make this a beautiful room. I'll make you some curtains. Strange. What? This, uh, this gesture of you make with your hands sometimes, Mama used to do it too. I'm gonna help you paint, too. I'm very good at it. Oh, Rayzel, I start to feel happy again. David comes to arrive in two weeks. I can't believe this. It's too good to be true... Are you happy? Yeah, sure. Why shouldn't I be? You have special someone in your life, like David? I don't need anybody special. I got my work. I love the plant here. ...what is going to happen to him when he comes to U.S.? His English is worse, even, than mine. We'll give him a job in the storeroom. We need a strong man in there. No, no. No son-in-law of mine is going to be a stock boy. Big shot. Oh, and we'll give the young couple a dining room set to get them started. And the green table lamps. Where did we get them? Cousin Max. - Oh, Max! - Max would be furious. Thank you. So, Rayzel, what's new at your store? Well, my boss - Lusia, - a woman who's - did you ever learn - way above me, asked me to... - to make your grandmother's dumplings? - They were as light as feathers, and so delicious! So, is, uh, rayon popular with the ladies these days? I can't keep it in the store. - Imagine - It's always my thing, so I... - I come to the house of my daughter - and her husband for dinner. It's a miracle. I have a family. A family! - Oh, it's a miracle, yes. - You always had your family. You just never noticed. What's the matter with her? Nothing. Forget it. No, no, you wanted to say something. Say it. Say it. What? What? Do you see me at all? Me, your daughter, I'm looking right at you. But, you don't see me, do you? I don't see you? - No. - What do you mean? - You've never seen me. - Well, I don't need you. Rose White doesn't need you. Rayzel, ha-have some "kashedan." Rose White? Who's she talking about? Me. You, Rayzel? I don't understand anything. It doesn't mean anything, "Rose White." It's for her- for her business, for her career. It doesn't mean anything! It's... "Rose White"? You changed your name? Yes. You throw away my name? You deny your family? You are Rayzel Weiss, and you will always be Rayzel Weiss, or you're not my daughter! Oh, Mordechai! - Mordechai, please... - My name is the only thing I had to give to her. No, you gave her more than that, Mordechai. This is not an orde... - Is that what you think? - Is that what you thought all these years? What about love, Papa? - Love... - Yes, love! What do you know about love? Enough, enough, please! You never wanted my love. - How can you say that? - Every time I tried, You push me away. - That's not true. - It is true! I left behind my wife, my home, my firstborn. All I had was you, and you did not want me. I didn't want you? That's ridiculous! - You did not want me, and you know why? You know why? Because, you never forgave me for taking you away from your mama. Rayzel! - Lusia, you stay. - Papa! She is in pain. If you want to be part of this family, you stay! Mordechai... I'm sorry Papa hurt you. It's alright. Rayzel, I did a terrible thing. What? When you ask if Mama s-spoke about you, I say no. She did talk about me? Mm-hmm. I should have give you this before, but I was afraid it cause you too much to hurt, and, instead, I hurt you. What is it? Is for you, from Mama. She write it before they take us, but she never get a chance to mail. I keep all this time. Now, you should have. It's in Polish. I can't read it. Can you translate? Sure. "My dearest daughter, Rayzel," "for long time, I have written," "and I know it could happen that you don't get the letters." "This one is meant by God's will to reach you." "Maybe, it is the last one." "I want to tell you everything." "I cannot hold you in my arms, but I hold you anyway in my heart." "This is true for every day in your life, since you was born." "Sometime, with God's blessing, you will have a child," "and you will know what I mean." "I want to send you something; your baby spoon," "or," "old toy. But, this letter will not hold that, so" "I have pasted a lock of my hair in it." "You try, and remember your Mama when it was as yellow as golden sun." "I cannot think of anything more to" "say, right now." "I have no advice to give to you." "You cannot put life on piece of paper." "I am not a smart person with writing down words, but" "I wish you understand how I feel for you," "my pretty little girl." "Your only mother," "Luba Eissmann Weiss." Love does not die. Time cannot kill it. Nor even many miles, nor even death. By the way, Rose, I still have some tickets left for the picnic. Oh, I have my ticket, Miss Ryan. Rose, whoever fills the position of Second Assistant Buyer is going to be making decisions that could cost the store thousands of dollars. So, I need a self-assured individual, with a clear picture of who she is, and where she's going. Does this describe you? No, ma'am. Good. Pardon me? That was honest. You didn't make excuses. I like that. You did, however, make two mistakes in processing the Lombardi order. Something is affecting your work, and I'm very concerned about you. You know, Rose, you have a fine future ahead of you, with many choices that nobody else can make for you. Only you know what you have to do. Papa? David... David! Lusia! David! - Lusia! - Lusia. Hi. Hi. I've missed my dancing partner. So have I. Well, goodnight. Goodnight. Would you like to walk me home? This is my mother, Luba Eissmann Weiss. She's beautiful. Thank you. And, this is my father, Mordechai Weiss. This is my sister, Lusia. She was found in the camps. My mother died there. She was living with me while she was waiting for her husband, David Pechenik. They were separated in the war, but now he's back, and they're together. And, this... this is me, Rayzel Weiss. [speaking foreign tongue] Let's get started. The sun will set soon. Oh, we still have a few more minutes. I mean, this is Lusia's first Shabbos in her own home, and the whole family isn't here. Family is here. Papa... - I said, the family is here. - Lusia, light the candles. There's no time for visitors. Papa, this is our home. I have listened enough. Ah, good Shabbos! David, look who's here. Good Shabbos. - Good Shabbos. - Uh, welcome to our home, Rayzel. Thank you, David. I was just about to light the candles. Um, let me get you a chair. Mordechai, please... Papa, please don't do this. This is our last chance to be a family; to accept each other as we are, and to go on with our lives. Just listen to her, Papa. Just listen. I've forgiven you. Can you forgive me? You look just like your mother. I love you, Papa. [speaking foreign tongue] Aw, Shimon, look. - Papa, the sun is setting. - We should start. So, who is stopping you? This is my first Shabbos in my new home, in my new country, with my whole family. I should like my sister to light the candles. Please? Thank you, Lusia. (Blessed are You, oh Lord our God,) (King of the Universe,) (Who has sanctified us with His commandments, and instructed us) (to light the candles of the Sabbath.) Amen. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. (Blessed are you, Lord our God,) (King of the Universe,) (Creator of the fruit of the vine.) Amen. - Amen. - L'chaim! (To Life!) [S.D.G.]
