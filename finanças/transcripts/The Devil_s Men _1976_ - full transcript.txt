[ominous music] [owl hoots] - We cover our faces in sight of our lord. [chanting] [screams] [birds chirp] - Hello, yes, yes, Sergeant Vendris here. Your letter, yes. Yes Father Roche, I did get your letter. Yes. I saw the photograph. Yes, I recognize them. They came through town a little while back. I hadn't seen them since. - If those children have disappeared, it won't be the first time it's happened in your village, Sergeant. - Come on, Father. You can't hold me responsible for every... Murder? What the hell do you... Listen Father, why don't you just stick to your own job and stop telling me how to do mine. [ominous music] - Morning Father. - [Father] Good morning. How are you? - Fine thanks. - [Father] Thalos. - [Thalos] Good morning Father. - I forgot to tell you you have some mail. Where do you want to eat tonight? Milo. Milo. All right. Who is she? - Incredible. How did you guess that my pen pal wore a skirt? - Gimme that letter. It's just another one from that haughty Irish priest. - Don't put him down. All right so maybe he's gotten carried away but he's no crackpot. He's the best friend I ever had and he's been good to me. I owe him a lot. So lay off him. - Oh come on. These things he keeps writing you about students disappearing, being swallowed up by some ancient magic or something. It's crazy, it's medieval. - Huh, I know it sounds a little far fetched but-- - Are you trying to tell me you believe it? - No. At least not enough to drop my work and go over there and help him, 'cause he wants me to. - Besides, if it's true he can tell the police. - He did. They don't wanna know. - Well, you can't blame them. They've got better things to do. - Good morning Father. - Is there a letter? - No letter. Here. - Thanks. Thank you. - [Carrier] Goodbye Father. - Goodbye, thanks. [car horn beeps] [car horn beeps] - Father Roche, we're back. - It's good to see you again Father. - It's good to see you. - Ian, shut the radio off, we can't hear anything. - Oh yeah sorry. - You've grown up a bit since last year. - Father Roche I'd like you to meet Tom Gifford. A friend of ours from Boston. - Good to see you Tom. - Thank you Father. - I say you've grown up a bit since last year. Thank god and you're prettier than ever. - [Ian] Don't encourage her Father. She's conceited enough as it is. - I didn't expect to see yo back here this year. I thought you'd exhausted the uh, archaeological possibilities of the area. - So did we but then Tom showed us something he dug up not far from here. - Yeah we thought it was interesting enough to come and take a look. - Then I've Tom to thank for the pleasure of seeing you again. What uh, what is this find? [ominous music] Here. Dig in. [laughs] Let's you listen to me now. Ian, it's no coincidence. There were two couples who came to that place. One French, the other English. They came here to my village to show me what they found and they went back to that land of evil to see if they could find anything else and they both disappeared without a trace. - [Tom] That's pretty heavy Father. I think maybe your imagination is working overtime. - You're out of line, Tom. We've known Father Roche for years. He's a world authority in ancient religions. I'm sure he knows a lot more about it than any of us. - Sorry. - Here, dig in. I'm putting you in separate rooms. 'Till I've pronounced you man and wife personally. Beth-- - [Ian] Probably best. - You're in here. Come on Tom and Ian. Ian, you're in this one. Tom, you're in there. - [Tom] Thanks. - Goodnight. Sleep well. - [Ian] Goodnight. - I certainly will now that I've talked you out of going back to that devil's territory. - Goodnight Father. - Goodnight. - [Beth] Shh. Get up we're leaving before Father Roche finds out. - What about Tom? - He's waiting in the car. - We can't do this to Father Roche. - We've got to. If we leave it 'till morning, he'll try and stop us. You want to go to the temple don't you? - You know I do. - Then be quick. [car door shuts] [engine starts] - [Father] May god go with you. - [Tom] Right now, Laurie, we're camping near the temple and plan to start our search in the morning. As you know, Ian and Beth are great to be with but I'm finding the nights awful lonely so what I want you to do is this, drop what you're doing and take a plane out here and join me. [rooster crows] - [Beth] Good morning. - If you do that again, I'll break your arm. - [Ian] Hey don't do that. Who'll do the coookin'? - What a nice place. [laughs] - [Ian] Look at the sights later. Food woman food. - We haven't got any, I'll have to go to the village. - Will you mail a letter for me while you're there? - To Laurie, right? I bet you miss her. - Yeah and you guys make it worse. Who can sleep with that going on all night, huh? - You don't have to listen. - [Ian] When's Laurie comin'? - [Tom] Next Saturday. I'm meeting her at the airport. - [Beth] I'm ready. - Thanks Beth. - I'll be right back. I hope you don't starve to death. - [Ian] No we won't. We can look around while we're waiting, huh? - Right. - Maybe we can find that entrance that Father Roche was talking about. - Hey. Ian, come and look at this. I found something interesting. The secret entrance. - [ian] The double axe. This must be the tomb that Father Roche was talking about. - Let's put it over there. - [Ian] Jeez, it's heavy. I'm going down to have a look. Tom! Tom! - Ian? - [Ian] Tom! Hold it, there's something down there. [ominous music] - [Tom] It's one of those couples. - It's those two in the photograph. Father Roche was right. - We'd better get outta here. - [Voiceover] Those who enter the forbidden chamber of the Minotaur must die. [bells ring] - Will there be anything else? - No thank you. [baby cries] - [Beth] What a beautiful baby. He's quite a character. - Good morning. What can I do for you? - I'd like half a dozen eggs, half a pound of bacon and a loaf of bread. - [Girl] Papa. Papa. Papa. [bells ring] - Oh. - Allow me. - [Beth] Thank you. - Is this yours? - Mm hm. - Max, will you put these things in the young lady's car, please? Are you here on holiday? - Well, sort of a working holiday. My friends and I are interested in archaeology. We've pitched a couple of tents near the temple by the old castle. - My castle. I am Baron Corofax. You are on my land. - Oh gee. - [Baron] But don't worry. If you're genuinely interested, this is one of the oldest pagan sites in the country. - Are you a real Baron? - For my sins. It's an ancient title in my own land. Which is Carpathia. Now I live here. If I can be of any help to you and your friends, don't hesitate to call on me. - Thank you. Goodbye. Oh, my package. - Forgive me. Goodbye. - Bye. Tom! Tom! Ian! Tom! Tom, Ian. Tom, Ian! Where are you? - [Man] I found this young lady wandering in the grounds, sir. She's looking for her friends. - I know you're worried but there's no reason to be. Your friends can't be far away. - I don't know. I'm afraid. - My dear child, they're perfectly safe and so are you. All you need is a good night's rest. You can stay at the inn. My chauffeur will drive you there. - Thank you very much but I'd rather walk. It might help to calm me down. - As you wish. - Goodnight Baron and thank you. - Goodnight. [ominous music] [screams] - Taxi. - Are you sure there's nothing else in the letter? - No, it's just as I told you. He told me he was camping at an ancient site and that he'd meet me at the airport and he wrote me about you. That's why I came here. [phone rings] - Hello? Just a minute. It's for you, long distance. - Hello? Who? Hello Father, how are you? What do you mean? Well I can't just... Really? When? Look Father, I do believe you, but... All right, calm, calm down, calm down. I'll be there as soon as I can. - That's gratitude. I break my neck to get over here and what do I get? Nag, nag, nag. - Keep your hands on the wheel. - Okay. - If you crossed the Atlantic Ocean just to get us killed in a car smash, you might as well have stayed in New York. - What? And miss all the scenery? - Keep your hands on the wheel. - Okay. - [Father] Just look at the speedometer Laurie. I'd have taken the bus if I had known he was such a speed demon. - There you go again. Demons and devils. [laughs] How we doing? - [Father] We're nearly there. - You got to remember, I'm just a simple private detective. I deal in facts and all you're giving me is demons and devils. - [Father] Don't drive so fast. - [Milo] If you're afraid to meet your maker, we're all in a lot of trouble. - I'm not afraid to meet my maker. I just don't want to meet him today. - [Milo] Looks as though the devil's got another one. [baby cries] Excuse me, who's the funeral for? - The innkeeper. He had a heart attack. - [Milo] That counts as an act of god? - [Father] Have some respect, will you? [ominous music] - What a strange child. - [Milo] I didn't notice. Let's go to the police now and see if they know anything. - [Laurie] Hey what about me? - Don't worry, we won't be long. Keep your eyes open for some more funerals. Excuse me, who's in charge? - He's there but can I speak to you for a moment, please? - Sure. - [Sergeant] Can I help you? - Oh excuse me, I'm, I'm Father Roche. We have talked together on the telephone. - Oh yes I understand. You said some kids had disappeared. - Yes that's right, Sergeant. - Vendris. - Sergeant Vendris. This is Mr. Kay. - How do you do. - Mr. Kay lived here at one time. - Come into my office. I told you. - [Milo] How did they disappear? - Who said they disappeared? I said they were here and then they must have left. - This is the third disappearance in a row and this time there were three of them. - What do you want me to do? - Well maybe you could start by telling us where we can find a place to stay. - [Sergeant] Well I don't know. Usually you can stay at the inn but the owner's just died. Why don't you wait here and I'll see what I can do. I'll be right back. Excuse me. - [Father] You see? He doesn't admit a thing. - Wait a minute. Our friend Vendris may be a little shifty eyed but that doesn't make him a demon. [children yell] - I've got to talk to you. - [Father] What's the trouble? - There's something terrible going on here. - You know something about these kids who have disappeared? [gasps] - I can't talk now. Come to my house, I'll tell you everything then, not here. - Hey hold on, wait a minute. - Well it's all set. The widow is in no state to do anything so our grocer, Mr. Caraperis said he'd do what he can for you at the inn. Get the maid to make up the beds. - Mrs. Mikalis told me she wants you to make yourselves at home here. - [Laurie] Oh thank you. - My daughter is getting your rooms ready for you. Oh she's here. Come with me please. - Oh thank you. [ominous music] [knocking] - Come in. - Comfortable in here? - Oh yes very. - Everything required for the well equipped devil hunter, hey? [laughs] Very nice work. - Beth's father made it for me. Years ago. - And holy water too. I've never had such a well armed assistant. [humming] I'm gonna see that woman. - No. No you're not going tonight. - Why? - Because I make the decisions. Please. Trust me. - Oh. [humming] [suspenseful music] [screams] - [Father] What happened? - [Milo] Even I can't tell you that 'till she comes around. - All right if you won't believe me, I guess I might as well just shut up. - That's a good idea. If I have to listen to both of you harping on the subject, I'll go nuts. - Where did you get this ridiculous car? - Rented it at the airport. - Well if it doesn't belong to you, don't drive it so fast. [screams] Stop, stop. My hat. My best hat. Stop, stop. - Forget it, I didn't like it anyway. [laughs] [tires screech] - Tom said in his letter, they were trying to find the ancient tombs. - I should never have told them the thing existed. - Hey Father, is that it over there? - It's over there. - [Laurie] Oh. [ominous music] - [Milo] Look out! If that's not the devil's work, look. - The devil has many faces and many helpers too. - Come on let's get out of here. - [Milo] It's all right, there's no one here now. - There is someone here. I can feel him all around me but I'll come with you. We must go and see the Baron. - Or that woman. I'm sure she knows something. - I'm dirty. I think I'll take a bath. - [Father] All right. - [Milo] We'll wait for you downstairs. - [Laurie] Okay. - [Woman] Father. Father please come here. - What is it? - Wait, that's my friend, why don't you come, wait! - Where are you heading? - To see you. - We were down at the castle. We came back to ask you a question. - Oh, never mind about that right now. The Baron said he'd like a word with you. - [Milo] He's not the only one. - [Sergeant] He invited you up to the castle. - [Milo] What happens if we refuse? - Do get in please. - Get in. - Please. - What about Laurie? - I think we'd better leave her here. I hope he's a better driver than you are. - Have you seen my friends? - The Baron's chauffeur came and picked them up. - Oh, why didn't they wait for me then? Wasn't I invited too? - They'll be right back. Sit down. I'll buy you a drink. - No thanks, I'd rather take a walk. - As you wish. - This way. - Thank you. It uh, it was very kind of you to invite us. - Purely selfish, I'm afraid. I have little in common with the local people. Please make yourselves comfortable. - If you have nothing in common with the local people, why can't you return to your own country? - Alas, I'm an exile. You being an American will find that hard to understand. - Being an American, I understand it okay. - Oh excuse me. - Mrs. Mikalis is staying with me for a few days. - I was sorry to hear about your husband. Please accept my condolences. - [Milo] Mine too. - Thank you. - Hi there. - A fine child. - [Mrs. Mikalis] Thank you. - What an odd toy. - Odd? - Yeah. - [Baron] It's old, but not odd. That is the Laprides. - I know. - [Milo] How old is this? - Perhaps 4,000 years. - It's, it's the ancient symbol of the Minoan priesthood. - [Milo] Drop us off here, we'll walk the rest of the way. - I can't stop thinking about it. What a strange toy to give to a child. I didn;t want to say too much but it's also a symbol. A symbol of human sacrifice. - Can't you let up for a minute? It was only a toy. let's go and see that woman. Maybe then we can find some facts. [knocks] [knocks] [suspenseful music] [glass shatters] [screams] - It's Laurie. Go and get Vendris. I'll take care of Laurie. Go on. Laurie! Laurie! Laurie! Laurie! [crying] What's the matter? - They're coming, they're coming, quickly, they're coming, they're coming, the demons. - [Milo] What demons? - [Laurie] Did you see them? - [Milo] Well there's nothing to see. - They were there I tell you. I saw them. - Well whatever it is, it's gone now. Probably just a cow loose in the woods or something. - Oh god, I've never been so scared in my life. - At least you didn't pass out today. Come on let's get back to the inn. [light switch flickers] - What the devil? Oh, no lights. Is there anyone here? Where is everybody? [glass shatters] Oh, thank god it's you. - Who'd you think it was? Old Nick? - The whole village is deserted. - What do you mean? - I mean just exactly what I say. - Why don't you turn the lights on? - Because there aren't any lights. - I told you, they've been here, they've turned the lights off. - Laurie stop it. Look, look, stop. Calm down. - I told you. - Calm down. - Oh Father. - It's all right Laurie. It's all right. You need to rest. Come on Laurie, come on. - I told you. - [Father] You need to lie down. [ominous music] - When you finish, come downstairs. I'm gonna have a drink. - Are you all right now? - I'm scared Father, please stay with me. - Do you want to come back downstairs with us? - No. I'm tired of being treated like a child. Milo doesn't believe me but there was something chasing me in the woods. I couldn't see them clearly but they were like, they were like some human fiend. - I believe you. - I'm worried, what's happened with Tom? - I think he, I think he's been held captive. - Captive? - By Satan. Mephistopheles. Lucifer. These are just three words for the same thing. A phenomenon that's older than mankind. A power without a face. A force that can make people do whatever it wants them to do. The devil, yes. Yes, Laurie. The devil. I believe the devil has taken possession of this village. - I don't want to insult you Father. I'm not religious, I don't believe-- - You young people are all the same. You live entirely on the surface. You don't understand the frailty of mankind. - Oh don't get angry with me. - I am telling you the truth. I'm telling you the truth. Now do you want to come downstairs and have a drink with us? - No, I think I'll have a rest but if you hear me calling, you'll come quickly? Father? - The devil has many faces. You better, you better lock your door. - Well, did you spell out your theories on the new look in old religions? Did she buy it? Score one for her. I guess she's not so dumb after all. Well, you're probably right about one thing. Those kids are being held prisoner somewhere and where the devil did the whole village disappear to? - You've answered your own question. To the devil. [laughs] - What do you want? Why are you torturing us? - [Voiceover] Only one thing can save you now. Father Roche must die. He has entered my forbidden chamber. - No! - [ian] What's the matter? - He wants Father Roche. He wants me to murder him. [laughs] - Do you think she's gone to sleep? - Why don't you leave her alone? She's engaged. - Why should you care? Because she kissed you? - How do you know that? [laughs] - It's written all over your face. [ominous music] What's the matter? - Come here, come and look. - What is it this time? Where are they? - They've gone. - They've gone, eh? Maybe you just can't hold your liquor. - There's nothing wrong with my capacity. I tell you I saw something out here. - Well I didn't. You might be right. [engine stalls] - What's the matter? - We're out of gas. That's funny, I filled the tank this morning. - [Father] Never mind, let's head after them. They're headed towards the woods. [car engine starts] [tires screech] - [Milo] You lousy son of a bitch! Are you okay? - Yes, I, I think so but, did you have to push me so hard? - I'm sorry. I should've let him hit ya'. [ominous music] - The old customs remained and the ancient gods live on. [chanting] [chanting] - Milo, it's their car. They must be holding them somewhere near here. Milo! It's their car! - Who's car? - The children, Beth and Ian! [engine stalls] - The old sacrifice remains and the ancient gods live on. [chanting] - Come on quickly, I tell ya'. [engine stalls] [ominous music] [engine stalls] [ominous music] - No! [screams] - Come on quickly, I tell you! [engine stalls] [ominous music] [screams] [engine starts] - Come on. [retches] [laughs] - He's still alive. - Yes, he was on the edge of death but it takes more than the force of an automobile to destroy them. Come we must bury these two. [screams] [screams] [screams] - [Laurie] Father! [screams] [bell rings] - Are these really the same people? - Yes, I'm afraid so. They are the same people. [speaking foreign language] - But everything looks so normal. - [Mrs. Mikalis] Good morning. - [Father] Good morning. The power's back. - [Mrs. Mikalis] What do you mean? - Is the young lady awake yet? - [Mrs. Mikalis] Young, what young lady? - Her clothes are all gone. Where the hell is she? What are you doing in here? - You frightened me. I'm sorry. It was an accident. - Good morning. - Where is she, Vendris? - Isn't she with you? [grunts] - What have you done with her? - [Sergeant] I don't know what you are talking about. [grunts] - Talk, where is she? Talk, talk, damn you. - What's going on? - [Milo] The girl's missing, where is she? - If she is missing, úassaulting the police is not the best way to find her. - [Milo] All right then, you tell me. - [Baron] Stay where you are. - [Father] I don't think we have any need of a shotgun, Baron Corofax. - Someone has to keep law and order. You realize that assaulting a police officer is a very serious offense. - [Sergeant] And I'm going to prefer charges. - Shut up, I'm not finished with you yet. - Mrs. Mikalis, these gentlemen say they came here with a girl. Do you know where she is? - A girl? I don't know. I didn't see any girl when I opened up. - Perhaps she decided to leave on her own. - Where was your car last night, Baron? - At my house. - You're a liar. - How dare you speak to me like that? I could cut you in half with this and everyone will swear it was self-defense. - Except me. - [Baron] You have one minute to get out of here. Both of you. - Not without Ms. Gordon. - 50 seconds. - Well uh, we have to pack. - 40. [gun shot] - Come along. Come on. This isn't the last time we'll meet, Baron Corofax. Why are we stopping? Do you think you're going to get anywhere with bullets? - Why not? The baron didn't look bullet proof to me. - You still can't face it. Can you, Milo? We are up against a force that no traditional weapon has the power to destroy. - So we're not even gonna try and fight it, right? We just forget about Ian and Beth and what about Laurie? What do we do, just walk out? Leave her to those fiends? - Oh no, we're coming back. Listen to me, Milo. There is one force that has the power to stop them. Otherwise, they would've ruled the entire world from the beginning. - Yeah well, I could be scared if I thought about it. - That makes you human like the rest of us. Oh yes, yes. We'll go back. We'll go back with the sort of weapons we need to fight them. - [Voiceover] Those who enter my forbidden chamber must die. Kill the priest. - [Baron] I hear you oh lord. Your will be done, oh lord. - Milo, stop at this church. May you be purified water with the power to drive the fire out of the enemy by the living god, by the true god, by the holy god. That's good. Now we're ready. - Just in case. - Well, you're still an unbeliever. - You could say that. I'm still thinking about that. [owl hoots] [ominous music] [tires screech] - Can't you go any faster? We must be there by moon rise. - [Milo] What's got into you all of a sudden? I thought speed scared you? - This time god is with us. - I hope you're right, 'cause the way I'm drivin' we're gonna need him. No sign of anything happening up there. What time does the moon rise? - It won't be long. - How do you know that there has to be a moon for the sacrifice to happen? - I just know it that's all. I just know it. The exact moment that the moonlight falls on the Minotaur, the ceremony begins and this time it's Tom and Laurie that are to be killed. - Why didn't they kill Tom yesterday? - Because the Minotaur commands that a couple be sacrificed. [ominous music] - We've got to stop them. I'll turn them back. - You act as if you hadn't understood a word I said. We pray thee, almighty god, confound the haughtiness of our foe. Crush with thy mighty arm his insolence. That you may humble the enemies of your holy church. Amen. Come on! - [Baron] We cover our faces in sight of our lord. [chanting] [chanting] - The sacrifice begins when the moon shines through that window. I'm gonna climb up there and block it. [grunts] [grunts] I'll go to the window. You go down the other way. Good luck, Milo. - [Baron] The old customs remain. [chanting] [snaps] [ominous music] [screams] [screams] [chanting] - Stop! [chanting] Stop! Stop this! Stop or I'll shoot! Stop. - [Voicevoer] Go seize the intruder. [gun shots] [gun shots] - [Voiceover] Those who enter the forbidden chamber of the Minotaur must die. [ominous music] [speaking foreign language] [explosion] We want to thank you father for what we've seen happen tonight. [speaking foreign language] Amen. - [Milo] Aren't you gonna pray for me, Father? - I'll pray for you, Milo when you need me. - [Tom] How did the children survive? - [Father] They're young. Their souls are incorruptible. In their purity and innocence lies the hope of the future but the fight against the devil goes on and one day, Milo, who knows? Maybe I'll need your help again.
