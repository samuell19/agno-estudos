Understand, sir. I can't soave that little problem right now. Give me all my money. Right now. I'll see what I can do. Right now. Here are your seven pesos, sir. -I have a surprise for you. -Good or bad? I resigned. Where? My priesthood. Don't fret, Father. You don't have to call me that anymore. From now on, I'm Ernesto. Just Ernesto. Aren't you scared of going out Like an ordinary man? No. Quite the opposite. Well, I am scared, Father. Of what? I don't know. That we stop Loving each other. That won't happen. We?ll Love each other forever. -Father, you're... -I'm not a priest anymore. Don't call me that. I don't understand. I thought the news would make you happy. Say something. Irene, do you Love me?

She's first place in everything. Sit down, please. You startled me. I knocked but you didn't hear me. What a coincidence. I was writing for our class tomorrow. Let me read it. I've come to show you how right you are... ...about everything you've written and thought. Isn't our class tomorrow? Today is a special Lesson. It's about suffering. There's a shadow you have to cross... ...and I'll help you. You're scaring me. You're right to feel scared. Mom! Calm down. She's coming. Everything that's happened to you up till now... ...everything you've lived, has only been a dream. You know what? You just woke up. No. What will you do? You smell nice. So clean, so groomed. Such a soft skin... perfect. No, please. -Hello, Antonio. -Hello, Eliseo. Mario hasn't come? Yes, he was here early but you didn't show... ...so he got bored and Left. -Whose clothes are those? -What's it to you? Don't speak to me Like that. I speak to you however I want. Why do you hate me so much? I've never harmed you. So now it turns out that you're the victim? Do you want coffee? -Don't change the subject. -Don't hit me. You know what, Mom? This shit is over. Oh, it's you. That explains it. -What's with the noise? -You fucking bitch! On your knees! They're all Like you. Cowards. -Look how your hands shake. -I beg you. Forgive me, I beg you. Good evening, Lucia. Good evening, Eliseo. What brings you here at this hour? -I came to say goodbye. -Why? Where are you going? I'm going far away. To the other side of the world. Where is the other side of the world? I'm going to the antipodes, Lucia. Don't tell me you're off to some war? It's confidential and I can't speak of it... ...but something Like that. -When are you Leaving? -Right now. I hope you?ll write to me. I came to say goodbye... ...because you've been very special with me. I hold you in high esteem. You're a very intelligent man and a great reader. -Don't forget me. -Don't worry, Lucia. You?ll hear from me soon. You?ll do very well. I'm sure of it. -Welcome. -Good evening, sir. Would you Like an aperitif? Some of the house's red and while you're here... ...a spaghetti Bolognese. Very well, sir. Excuse me. Why your obsession with me, Jesus, son of the Almighty? I pray to God that you cease to torment me... ...because He said: ''Get out of this man, evil spirit.'' And I asked it: ''What's your name?'' It answered, saying: ''My name is Legion. Because we are many.'' Wait. Keep the change. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Welcome. Table for two? Yes.
