Mixed Martial Arts, dubbed the decathlon of combat sports, which has relatively few rules. Fighters can use various fighting styles from boxing to judo, karate, and Muay Thai. Mixed Martial Arts is just the modern boxing ring. Knocked off. You both know the rules. Fight when I say fight, stop when I say stop, understand? Touch gloves. Ready. Ready? Fight! "Female Championship Fight of Mixed Martial Arts" Sheila Lee is the better technical fighter. Unless she makes unforced errors, she'll win this championship. She's my best friend, Sheila Lee, daughter of the Fight Club owner. We're neighbors when we were little, then grew up together. She even taught me a few boxing moves, then I went to study in Canada. I now work at mother's accounting firm, it's a daily battle. I slowly lost contact with Sheila, and followed the path my mother chose for me. I don't know why, but it's not the life I want. Chandler, it is kind of urgent, I need your signature. Miss Yui, is this okay? It's fine. Miss Yui, here's the information that the client requested. Found you! What are you... I'm sorry! Did I get any on you? Think you can touch me? You're too weak... Cut the act. I'm fine, but you're in big trouble. Why? Your mother is looking for you, you know what I mean? You know why? She wants you handle some big project. Big... See her after you finish throwing up. So many stairs... Where are you? Your mother's looking for you! I don't know you. Cut it out, I'm hot and tired. Welcome, Miss Yiu. - Are you here on vacation? - Yes. Finally, air conditioning. You do are some kind friend. You never visit, and now need a place to crash. Is this how you treat friends? We're sisters, it's different. It's been so long, let me hug you. - You didn't use perfume? - What? Do I smell bad? Not good. What happened? You used be so put together. I still am. These magazines are so old. Your flowers are dead. - What's wrong? - Are you sick? You haven't stopped talking since you came. Look at you, you never used to eat junk food or drink sodas. But it's delicious, try some? Who can it be? What's wrong? You're the same after all these years. You're ready to throw up, why don't we... A dozen beers, please! You're still a tomboy after all these years. You too! When did you get back? 6 months ago. And you never called me! I work at the accounting firm from morning to night. I never even get to see the sun much less you! You just don't want to see me. If that were true, I wouldn't be here. So you're still afraid of your mom? You know how she bosses me around, and criticizes everything I do. You don't always get to do what you want. I don't get to do what I want either. At least, you make your own choices. You're so strong, I remember all your moves from all your past fights. There are lots of better fighters now. Let's drink first, cheers! Cheers. It's been... Let's play, pretty girl. Sure, but not with you. Such attitude, girl. Let's go. Don't go. Finish your drink first. Let go. Who do you think you are? Pretty girl. Stay a little longer? Don't touch her! Don't mess with me! Are you okay? It still hurts? - Let me do it. - My ankle is fine. It comes with the territory. Fighters can't be beauty queens. - It smells awful. - You think so? How long will you stay this time? I don't know. How about you? And how's Fight Club? The same. When's your next fight? You wanted to be the Hong Kong Champion, then take on the world. I quit fighting. Now I have a club to run, and it is time to pass the torch. Some big sister, right? And what happened to Shan now? You want to know? Go to sleep, let's visit Fight Club tomorrow. Okay. - Queen Lei. - Ginger? You're early, they're not shooting your part yet. I came to watch you do a fight scene. You're amazing, you did it in one take. Keep practicing, you can do it, too. I will. Yeung. Of course, I remember. I'll see you. Bye for now. - Was that Brother Yeung? - You are so nosey. You two are so sweet, I wish I had such a nice boyfriend. I'll leave you to change. Miss Lei, Steven wants to see you when you're done. Okay. Steven. You asked for me? Lei-lei, we need to talk. Marriage is just a piece of paper, it's pointless. That's why I want your blessing, Steven. Are you that desperate to get married? Can't you stay single? Are the bosses upset with me? Who's upset? You have so many fans! So, what's the problem? I'm worried once you get married, your fans might lose the will to live and even commit suicide. If your fan base shrinks, the bosses will drop you. Stop exaggerating, my fans aren't like that. Love makes everyone crazy, you're no exception. I see what you're hinting at. But I know Wong Yeung, he's not what you think. Silly girl, I know men. When you're young and beautiful, they love you. But when you're old and wrinkled, they won't love you then. Not all men are the same. Wong Yeung is not like that. All men are the same! Well, I have to go now, let's talk another time. - Lei-lei, listen to my advice. - Bye. It's been so long since I was last here. - Let's fight a few rounds. - Sure! Wait for me! Stop! Big Sister, long time no see. What're you doing here? I'm here with a business proposal. Not interested. You're not welcome here, please leave. I'll leave if you wish. But Fight Club has lots of debts, those loan sharks will come knocking soon. None of your business. This place is a dump. As a fellow fighter, I want to help. Ten million? What's this? I challenge you to a match. You win, you get the money. If you lose, I will get the Fight Club, both the name and property. It's a fair offer. No need to reply now. When you decide, contact my assistant. Here's my card. Call me when you're ready. Is what that woman said, true? How did you get into such debt? It's true. We survived this long thanks to Big Sister. She borrowed money from the bank, and even put her house... Shut up. What's the story with that woman? Why would she do this? Just stay out of it, it is none of your business. We're sisters, I'll support you no matter what. She's a fellow fighter. Everyone! For the upcoming tournament, Fight Club will be represented by Big Sister, Sheila Lee. Bravo! I object! Fa? The best fighter should represent us! I know you want to compete, but... But you never gave the rest of us a chance. You all know that Sheila has trained here the longest, and she is the best and most experienced. She should represent the club. A veteran fighter is not a sure bet. In terms of skill, I'm just as good as Big Sister. I think Fa is right, let's fight for it. The winner represents us. Sheila... Red corner, ready? Blue corner, ready? Fight! Get her! Get her! You can do it, go on! Stop! Ho Fa is representing Fight Club, instead of Sheila Lee. Stop! The winner representing Fight Club is Ho Fa! "Letter of withdrawal" Stop! Our winner today is Ho Fa! I'm Ho Fa! Stop! Not long after, Papa passed away. I promised him to keep the club going. To cover costs, we borrowed lots of money. - Am I a failure? - Of course! But it's miracle that you kept the club going this long. But don't forget we're sisters, I'll support you no matter what! Me too! Sisters! "Your request is being processed" What? This is gone too far! You're calling me? You think you can hit me with that? You're weak. Gigi-mama, why are you here? As long as you're on this planet, I can hunt you down. It's good you're here! Why did my mom empty my account? If you don't come home, your money will be the least of it. Listen. Hey, you were always a bad worker, and now you even dare to run away because of a little pressure? You have no willpower! Dare to run away from home, think that you can survive on your own? You'll never succeed! I don't care! Gigi-mama, I need the money. Find a way. Your mother has the money, not me. But you must know a way, so help me, Gigi-mama. Please! Alright, I'll try. Promise. Gigi-mama, you're the best! Thank you. Bye. What's this? This is for you too. What's wrong? Boss said you're taking over Chandler's workload. No... See you tomorrow. I am always picking up after you. Forget it, I'm going to have my meal now. - I ordered a drink for you. - Thanks. Sheila, I am sorry. I was hoping to use my savings to help you, but my mother emptied my account. I can't help you this time. Are you crazy? Don't do that, I'll handle it myself. Have you ever considered selling Fight Club to Ho Fa? No way, it's my father's legacy. But, Sheila... It could be the answer to all your problems. I refuse to sell no matter what. Well, I'll find a way to save the club, don't worry. Fight Club is deep in debt and you even sold your house, what else can you do? She's just trying to save Master's club. I may not know much. But unless Bruce Lee comes back to life, Sheila stands no chance against Ho Fa now. She'll lose everything regardless. What else can we do? I know what. Sheila is not the only fighter of the Fight Club, it can be anyone. We just need to find a top fighter to represent us, right? But where can you find a top fighter then? Order first. Our boxing club is doing so well, and Fight Club is almost bankrupt. Miss Fa, why bother with it? No matter how accomplished and successful we are, I never received Master's approval. Taking over his club proves I'm the best! Where do you think we can find top fighters to represent us to fight Ho Fa? You think it's easy. In the last few years, she won every match within two rounds. She's that good? Think about it. Ho Fa is a striker, and a pretty good grappler too. Anyone who fights her will... I know what! Marley Cheung, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu expert, Queen of Submission. She enjoys it when opponents scream with pain under submission holds. Are you sure this is the place? Yes! Really? Is that her? Who are you? - Queen of Submission, Marley Cheung? - Yes. This photo was taken at least 3 years ago, did you come for my autograph? Yes, I'm a big fan. Sorry to bother you. He's actually looking for a trainer, goodbye! Lau Chan-ying, trained in Muay Thai since age 6, 16 wins with only 3 losses. No one can withstand her Tornado Kick! The undefeated Luong Gui, known as Female Mixed Martial Arts's Divine Champion. Gui had cancer, who lost the battle and died last month. You're so kind. If she's watching from above, she would be touched. There's one more, Cheung Lei, the hottest action star. Cheung Lei is so cool! Cut! Next scene! - Let's recruit her! - How? Do you know how popular she is? She's been anointed "the next Michelle Yeoh". I didn't know, I was studying in Canada all these time. But if she's so famous, why would she help us? We'll find a way. Cheers! - Congratulations! - Thank you. I want to say two things. I, Wong Yeung, never dreamed it would take me 10 years to win Best Actor. This award doesn't just belong to me, but to everyone here. Especially my girlfriend, Cheung Lei. Thank you. Kiss! No problem. Let's party all night long! - Alright? - Yes! Cheers! - Thank you, everyone. - Congratulations! - Cheers! - Congratulations! He's such a good actor. Baby, I'm going to washroom. - Should I go with you? - No. Just entertain your friends. Congratulations. Women and success, you have it all. I confess, I'm quite greedy. That's what I like about you. Yeung, I brought the chocolate cake you like. You know me best. Everyone, cake time! Expectations are running high, right? - Faster. - Where to? It's so hot. What do actors fear most? - Don't know. - Managers. Ladies, you're here because you want to be models or actresses? Many have tried and failed. Actually, we have an offer for Cheung Lei. Which company? What kind of offer? Our Fight Club wants to recruit her for an Mixed Martial Arts fight. Lei-lei quit Mixed Martial Arts fighting a long time ago. But I know Miss Cheung will always be an Mixed Martial Arts fighter at heart! I get it, I can feel your sincerity. I'm truly touched. Okay, I'll make an exception. How much are you offering? How much? What for? Okay, I'll give you a figure. A nominal fee of 100 million. 100 million? Miss Cheung, you look stunning. It's the gown. This wedding gown is by French designer, Herbert. Not everyone wears it as well as you do, you do looks brilliant in it. My fiancee looks good in everything. You're here? How could I miss your fitting? What a sweet talker. Queen Lei. Ginger, what brings you here? I'm trying on my wedding gown. Is it a costume for a role? It's for my own wedding. Congratulations! You never mentioned it. Who's the lucky guy? What do you think? Why are you holding my arm? Where's your lead actor? You deserve to be best actor, even in real life. What are you talking about? Yeah, what you're saying? We don't understand you. Didn't you tell her? Want me to do it? Tell me what? Yeah, we don't understand what you're saying. He doesn't love you anymore, that you're cold and insensitive. He lost interest in you long ago. It's not true, baby. Yeung, I need to hear it from you. Is she telling the truth? No, Lei-lei... What do you mean? That's not what you said in bed. You said her body does nothing for you. I never said that! It's not true, Lei-lei. I don't blame you; this gown suits me better than you. Lei-lei. You have two choices, it's either her or me. If you can't decide, I'll help you. - I'll go to the press! - Don't you dare! Ginger! Lei-lei, just me time to sort this out. We'll talk later. Ginger! Ginger! If we approach her directly, will she help us? You never know unless you try. You're right, let's give it a try. And try to be sincere. Queen Lei! Now is not the best time for autographs. No, not that! Queen Lei... - Quickly. - I have a proposition, can you represent my Mixed Martial Arts club in a match against Ho Fa? I quit Mixed Martial Arts fighting long ago. No, Queen Lei... Quick, be sincere, tell her more. I'm the owner of Fight Club. Ho Fa challenged me to a fight. If she wins, I will lose the club. I can't fight because an old injury. Please return to the Mixed Martial Arts fighting, and help us fight this match. You've come to the wrong person. I'm sorry, I must go now. 10 bags of chips, that should last you a long time. Don't I treat you well? 10 bags? They'll be gone in no time. No way! Don't underestimate me. Aren't you leaving some for us? Are you done? As if I didn't have enough on my mind. I'm sorry. I know you're under stress. Maybe we should negotiate with Ho Fa? What did you say? I'll never give up my father's legacy. Face facts, you're doing all this for a rundown boxing club. If you want to regain Fight Club's former glory, find another place and start fresh. I've lived and breathed that place since birth. You've only worked in air-conditioned offices, what do you know? Okay, I know nothing then. What's your solution? What can you do? At least, I'll keep trying. Maybe go find a fighter as representative. If not, I'll fight myself! You fight? How? Look at you, all you eat is junk food now. Have you ever trained? You'll be destroyed if you step into the cage. Right, that's what I want. Are you satisfied with that? Do you want the whole world to watch you suffer? Go away. Get lost! - You're sisters... - Get lost! Maybe go find a fighter as representative. If not, I'll fight myself! You fight? How? Look at you, all you eat is junk food now. Have you ever trained? You'll be destroyed if you step into the cage. Do you want the whole world to watch you suffer? Right, that's what I want. Are you satisfied with that? "Cheung Lei Gone Missing, Day 4" "Action Star Cheung Lei has gone missing and disappeared" "Amid those breakup rumors..." "Women in Combat released today" Have you found Lei-lei? Not yet, we've tried everything... If you don't find her, don't come back. Chandler, why are you drinking alone? You're drunk. No, I'm not, yet quite sober now. Sit back. I mean seriously, can you help Big Sister? I want to help, but she wouldn't let me. Just let her fight. But Big Sister can't fight anymore. Of course, she can't. She eats junk food all day, and does no training. She's no better than you now. You've got it all wrong, she can't help it. Really? It's her leg... Bring ice! Don't touch her! Hurry! The doctor said Big Sister tore her anterior cruciate ligament badly. If she continues to fight, she may be crippled for life. I'm fine. I'll be back fighting in no time. Don't force yourself. No father wants to see his daughter hurt so badly or crippled for life. Believe me, I'll be back fighting soon. If it's what you want and you're confident, just do it. The spirit of the sport is not about winning, but trying your best that you shall have no regrets. The same applies to life. Big Sister quit Mixed Martial Arts fighting because of her injury. I know you were trying to protect me, you were worried about me. I'm sorry that I didn't know about your leg injury. I couldn't tell you. Nothing fazes my father, but he was worried sick over me. You vomit at the thought of your mother. Is that funny? Of course! I need a leg massage. Is this the injured leg? No, it's the other one, but I want you to massage this leg. Sure. You're hurting my good leg! No pain no gain. Cheung Lei got drunk at a bar, I brought her back here. Who are you? Don't be alarmed. I'm your savior. You wanted me to fight for your club. So what happened? Why am I here? If I didn't bring you back here, you'd be lying on the street. Get out! Are you feeling better? You're running a fever, just get some rest. We'll talk when you're better. So? Has she recovered? Still running a fever, but better after taking medicine. I think Queen Lei is actually quite friendly. Why don't we ask her directly? Maybe she'll help us. No, she's still weak and just suffered a trauma, we sould not bother her now. But we're running out of time, can you fight Ho Fa yourself? If there is no other way, so be it. But I really think we should... Thanks for the use of your king-sized bed, I do miss the energy of the cage. If you still want, I'll fight for you. Really? Miss Fa. We heard that they recruited an outsider. Have they no shame? An outsider? Never mind, the result will be the same, I'll win in the end. They recruited Cheung Lei. Cheung Lei? Great, I've always wanted to fight her. She garnered quite a reputation in Mixed Martial Arts. Are you saying I'll lose to her? Stop! Do you want to kill her? You should know better. It's about time. We will win! Fight Club recruited action star Cheung Lei to fight Ho Fa, aka the Terminator. It will be the battle of a century. In her last five fights, Ho Fa knocked out every opponent within two rounds. She shall be in her peak form now. In contrast, Cheung has focused on acting in recent years, is she still the same strong contender today? You both know the rules. Fight when I say fight, stop when I say stop. Understand? Touch gloves. Ready... Fight! The fight has started, both fighters are keeping their distance. Cheung scopes Ho out with a few kicks. Based on fitness, both are equals in terms of speed and power. Ho Fa may have the upper hand. Wait and see. Fa is in winning form today. Both sides are playing it safe, neither is attacking aggressively. Cheung anticipated a kick from Ho, and grabbed Ho's leg! Ho is down! But she managed to kick Cheung mid-air! Ho is determined and hungry for blood. It seem that she is not getting up, and trying to lure Cheung onto the matt. She's relying on her lower body. Ho's got behind Cheung, and restricts her with a bear hug. Ho is quick, easily breaking free. Brilliant move! Cheung just did a flying triangle. She's going for the kill with a triangle choke hold. But her legs give out and loosen her grip. Queen Lei's legs seem a little odd today. Attack her right leg! Ho brings Cheung down, and has Cheung in an ankle lock. Tap out! Wait, it's not over yet. Cheung appears to be struggling... The spirit of the sport is not about winning, but trying your best that you shall have no regrets. Ho Fa! How did you know about Cheung's injured leg? You thought that I couldn't win on my own? I was trying to help. You dare call that help! You are just bring me disgrace and ruin my reputation, I can no longer be the Terminator if this gets out! I didn't mean to. I don't ever want to see you again. And you, use your head. Think before you do something stupid! Yes, Miss Fa. Lei-lei, watching you fight was almost the death of me. I was once an Mixed Martial Arts champion. What could happen? Look at your face, that's what. What about your injured leg? - Doctor said it's fine. - How could it be fine? I told you to watch over her! If anything happens to her, we're both dead! Okay, I'm starving, - let's go. - Alright... I know, just get in the car. I knew you'd be hungry, so I baked you a cheesecake. Forget that Wong Yeung, and stop pretending that you like chocolate cake. Stop it, will you? Final 10 seconds! Hit harder, come on! 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. How are you? You came. After everything we went through, I lost everything in the end. You're giving up? That's not like you. If I had listened to you, I wouldn't be here. Now even Queen Lei is injured, she was my last hope. What are you doing here? The World Mixed Martial Arts Championship is coming up. If you get into the finals and defeat me, you can keep Fight Club. Are you nuts? You've already won, and know that we have no one left to go fight. You're ruthless! If I was ruthless, I would just take your club now. But I don't want an empty victory. It's up to you whether to fight or not. Fine, see you there. Gigi-mama! You scared me! My heart can't take it. Your type doesn't die so easily. Why the urgency? Did you miss me? Look, the work is piling up. If you don't come back soon, your mother will kill us all and I'll die for real. I'm not coming back, you know that I hate being an accountant. I won't let my mother boss me around my whole life. I want to support you, but have pity on a senior like me. Don't worry, Gigi-mama. I'll prove to mother that she's wrong about me, I can be a success. Good luck. Your mother will never approve. If you don't come back, what will you do? I have a plan, you'll see. I have to go, bye. Why I even bother? I'm sick of these mother-daughter games. I'll represent your club, and defeat Ho Fa. I'm serious. Sure. Excuse me, thanks. Don't you have confidence in me? Girl, you'd be the last pick of anyone in the club. You're out of shape, that you can't even run. So let alone fight. Then train me, Shan can train me too. Speak of how? If you get yourself killed, how will I face your mother? You don't have faith in me? She seems serious. You're already out of breath, how will you last 3 rounds? Listen, you're not cut out for Mixed Martial Arts. Stop this nonsense. You think I'm doing this for you? I want to show my mother that I can be the boss of my own life. I've decided to go all in. You can choose to help me or not. There is so little time left, you don't even know the basics. I can't do this alone. What now? Hello, Coach. I've only been away a few years, but Fight Club has changed a lot. After you left to be a judge of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, many things have happened. So this is the legendary Coach Li! With Coach's help, we might stand a chance. The one you're going to train. I'm Chandler Yiu. I don't coach just anyone, you'd better have potential. Now that I'm back, I can't allow my buddy's club to get taken away. Just do it! Keep your hands up! Look at you! Keep your distance. Combination. I've told you many times, come on. Knee and elbow. Kick and one more. Now you see? Always keep your arms up. Don't slack off. I'm exhausted. No! I'm tired. Alright... - Last set. - You can do it. Good job. Way to go! "Monster Mother" And now you even dare to run away because of a little pressure? You have no willpower! You'll never succeed! You must find your own rhythm. 1, 2, 3, 4... Come on, kick. Strike and duck. Knee and elbow. One more. 1, 2, 3, 4... Keep it up. I surrender, don't hit my face! Enough, stop it! I surrender! Faster! - Your speed! - I know. You done pacing? I need to use the washroom. Again? You just went. Is it diarrhea? Just relax. Nerves will affect your performance. But I... I have faith in you. Relax, we're all here for you. If you can't go on, tap out. Okay? It's almost time. Okay? Concentrate. Go get her! Welcome to World Mixed Martial Arts' Qualification Rounds. First match of the night will soon begin, and features a newcomer. Let's looking forward to Chandler Yiu an her debut. Unfortunately, she's up against top favorite "Destroyer" Lee Mun in her first match. I'm afraid Yiu won't last one round. Be fair, it's Yiu's first match. Don't give her pressure. Cage is closed and fighters are ready now, fight begins! The Destroyer makes the first move, and attacks Yiu aggressively. Yiu is hit by a sidekick and another, who then being pushed away with that hard front kick! Keep your distance! Yiu fights back but her punches are weak. Lee delivering a quick succession of blows, that she seems to go for a quick win and giving Yiu no chance to regroup. So far, the Destroyer is dominating, who is a tough opponent. Yiu fights back valiantly. Lee has her pinned, and delivering a rapid succession of blows. Will Yiu survive the onslaught? Keep your arms up! The Destroyer's track record is impressive, her last six opponents were carried off on stretchers... Chandler, do the grapple! And being sent to the hospital straight away. Records are meant to be broken, let's hope Yiu avoids that fate. Yiu grabs Lee's leg, and taking her down! But Yiu can't keep her pinned, Lee breaks free quickly. Yiu appears to be in the zone, by twisting Lee's arm behind her back, she locked Lee's wrist. Up until now, Yiu was the underdog, but she's put in a strong performance. Yiu brought Lee down with a rear naked choke, but the Destroyer is not giving up, by forcing Yiu to release her hold. Yiu miscalculated! The Destroyer is prepared and easily breaking free, who now launching a counterattack. But Yiu is taking advantage of her long limbs, by applying a triangle choke on Lee! Can she do it? I didn't expect Yiu to pull it off and use a triangle choke. Let go. It was an inspired move! Chandler Yiu, the Newcomer, has defeated Lee Mun the Destroyer. Looks like the one heading to the hospital with a stretcher is the odds-on favorite, Lee Mun the Destroyer. "Female Championship Fight of Mixed Martial Arts" Welcome to the quarterfinals, Chandler Yiu, who we once thought that should be an underdog, has turned out to be a dark horse instead. Yiu uses her triangle choke on the opponent again! Stop, let go! She won again! Yiu is in the finals! Watch out for this newcomer! Your emotions will be your ruin one day, one lucky punch can cost you the match. Tomorrow is the final, yet our opponent is amazing but arrogant. What's your take? She's entitled to her arrogance. Look at her, she knocked out all her opponents in two rounds. You're saying she'll lose tomorrow? - What did you just say? - I didn't say that. Anyway, let us all rest early tonight. Chandler, just remember everything I taught you, you won't lose tomorrow. Okay. Be careful tonight. Don't worry. Prior to my first tournament fight, I hid in the locker room and cried. I was so afraid and nervous, that I was paralyzed. But I told myself, that I'm doing what I love and no matter how afraid I am or how impossible it shall be, I just need to try my best. Did you win the fight? I lost. But I entered the ring without fear, I just focused on giving my best. Chandler. I'm sorry that you got dragged into this fight. Silly. I told you before, I'm not fighting just for you. Still, thank you. What happened? Why is tomboy Sheila so sentimental today? Ho Fa won't be easy to defeat. Alright. If I win, we'll go drinking, your treat. Deal. Go get her. "Monster Mother" In the blue corner, the newcomer who fought her way into the finals. Female Mixed Martial Arts new star, Chandler Yiu from Fight Club! Chandler, remember everything I taught you. Alright? Relax. And to find your own rhythm. Come. Get her! In the red corner, this year's favorite, Ho Fa from Vamos! - Ho Fa! - Get her! A round of applause for our two finalists! Ho Fa! We're down to the final fight. Will the previous champion Ho Fa win? Or the rising star Chandler Yiu instead? We'll have to wait and see. Both boxers have sailed through the early rounds. Current champion Ho Fa was expected to be in the final, but newcomer Chandler Yiu surprised many, who do beat the odds! Wait for my signal, okay? This will be quite a fight! Touch gloves. Fight! Ho Fa is goading Yiu from the start, she has an overwhelming personality. She seems to look down on Yiu, is Ho overconfident? It's her signature style. Why do fans love Ho Fa? Her theatrical display is just part of her strategy. It's a test of mental toughness. If you watch carefully, when Ho Fa is on the defense, she's calm and focused. Yiu may be aggressive, but she has no game plan. She poses no threat to Ho Fa. But don't underestimate Yiu, she has defeated some fierce competitors. Her fighting spirit is making up for her technical flaws. Ho easily thwarts Yiu's attack, pounding away at Yiu. Being forced to step back, Yiu knows she can't fight Ho at close-range. So she's keeping her distance. Ho continues to goad Yiu with fake-outs, who kick Yiu hard! Yiu is changing tactics, but that was just too soon! Ho has the upper hand. Yiu tries to perform a Kimura, but Ho quickly breaks free. Get out! Ho keeps Yiu stuck in an armbar, Yiu is hurting badly. Will she last the round? Time, Yiu survived the round! First round was tough for her, can she turn it around in the next round? Ho hasn't even broken a sweat, who seemes like just toying with Yiu. Why are you prolonging this? I want to devour my prey slowly. Slowly? What if you lose? Go in for the kill! In my own time. You're just playing into her rhythm, do you notice that? Keep your arms up, and protect your head. Keep your distance, stay out of range. Remember that. She wins with an armbar every time, what's so great about it? How do I counter it? When she grabs your forearm, hook your free hand under your other hand, which measns two hands against one. When she uses her other arm as well, you'll be overpowered, because her arms are stronger than your fingers. Now put your free hand against the mat, then roll to the other side and get on top of her. Ho Fa dominated the last round. As in round 2 now, I think she'll go in for the kill with a full offensive. - Ho Fa, go on! - Get her! Ho lands 4 blows in quick succession, destroying Yiu's defenses. Ho sweeps Yiu with a low-cut kick! Ho then pursue and attack, Yiu struggling to defend herself. Ho lifts her up, then throws her to the mat. Ho is not letting up, who use her signature armbar against Yiu now. Looks like it's the end of the line for Yiu. That's a great Tomoe Nage! Ho has Yiu in another death grip, but Yiu refuses to tap out! To turn the tables, she needs to think quickly. But Coach... Even if I escape the armbar, she still has the advantage. How will I win? Simple. Give her a taste of her own medicine. What is Yiu trying to do? She seems to find a way to counter! Don't let her get you! She's using an armbar on Ho! You can do it! But Ho easily breaks free. Yiu immediately goes for a rear naked choke. How long can Ho endure? She tapped out! Ho Fa tapped out! No one saw that coming, the winner is Chandler Yiu! Alright, that's it. I now return my half of the bed back to you. Are you sure about going back to your mother? Monster Mother? I have to face up to her eventually, right? Okay. Whatever happens, you're always welcome here. You're the new face of the club! Pull yourself together! Anyway, thank you. Cut! Lei-lei. I was wrong, give me a chance. I won't see her ever again, trust me! Let go. Let go! Give me a chance. It hurts! Let go! Lei-lei!
