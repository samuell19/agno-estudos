It's the good stuff. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Cuff him. Police check. - Move. - Move. - Get in. - This way. One more... Hey, cheers. - Bottoms up. - Cheers. Hey, do you know where we will go next? Columbia. Cappuccino? You idiot. They speak Thai, not Italian. Eight-faced Buddha. He's the go-to man after Khun Sa is gone. That's great, right? Time for food. Good, you are up. Let's eat. Come on. Chow, you haven't returned my calls in forever. My team can't do anything without your info. Are you planning to be a real gangster? This is for personal use. This is for buying and selling drugs. This is for Hak Tsai. This is for the Vietnamese guys. And this one is for you. I have so many phones right now. I worry I'll use the wrong phone one day, calling Hak Tsai and telling him to arrest the gang or calling to tell you to sell the drugs. I'll be so screwed up then. Give me something so we can arrest Hak Tsai and you are back on the team. Hak Tsai is a cunning bastard. I don't have anything on him. I only know that the deal will be done in the next couple of days. My wife is expecting a baby. What did you say? My wife is expecting a baby. When? She's due on the 18th. Just get the job done. Go take care of your kid. Of course. I can't live like you, divorced after a year of marriage and getting more time with thieves than your wife. Now you're going too far. He's right. What else could he do? Spend his life with me? Greetings, everyone. - Our theme today is Greatest Hits. - Let's eat. Next, we'll play Adam Cheng's hit song. Hey. It's your theme song. It's not just mine. We sang this song all the time. But you were the loudest one every time. I remember when I was a kid, I was Ximen Chuixue. What? I was Ximen Chuixue. No. You were Ye Gucheng. - I was Ximen Chuixue. - Nonsense. I was Ximen Chuixue. Ximen Chuixue has a pale complexion like me. Remember where we stashed our swords then? Of course. In the top row of the hollowed wall blocks at the stairs' landing. Top row? No way. He was short with stubby legs. He could never reach it. It was the lowest row, right? Can you reach the top row now? What? When I was young, they called me "the giant of Shek Lei Estate." What? I mean, you? A giant? You two suddenly gained height. I don't even know how. Now, don't crack sick jokes with others' pain. Sworn to tread the mountain of swords Hey, your turn. With courage, overcome a thousand barriers What's with the vibrato? That's what Adam Cheng did. It's never too late to know you well Lofty spirits and unswerving pride It's never too late to know you well Chai Kwok Yung, also known as Hak Tsai. According to our investigations, his gang is the fastest-growing drug dealing cartel in the Pearl River Delta region in the past three years. His hands might have reached Southeast Asia. We've been tracking them for six years. The latest intel shows Hak Tsai might have a deal with the Indonesian trafficker, Kanit. The deal is likely to take place in the Yau Ma Tei area. I need you guys to keep an eye on every junction for 24 hours. Be ready to take action. Attention. The lookouts are here. Tell these teams to come back here. Come back here, everyone. Yik and Kin. Gather both of your teams here. Target is on Temple Street. Do not expose yourselves. Identify every lookout. Target is arriving. Tap into his channel now. Yes, sir. Quick. Right here? That bastard is very cunning. He never trades at the same spot. Boss. Target location, 99 Temple Street, Shing On Building. What a safe spot you found here. How has it been? It has been a while. My trusted guy. Don't worry. To be honest, your stuff is 30% more expensive this time. Much more than inflation, my friend. Burmese government now promotes tourism. Farmers get subsidies for growing rice and sugar cane. No one grows opium anymore. Arrest the lookouts. You have your ways. After years of business, do I get a discount? Eight of my guys got killed for this. Did the police give me any discount? Cut it. This stuff will fetch a fair price. If you don't want it, many others do. Of course I want it. Just kidding. Don't be mad. Hey you, pay him. It's really good stuff. Don't worry. Not a dollar short. Everyone, stand by. Sir, an urgent call from Superintendent Wong. I'm too busy to talk. He said it's urgent. Sir, what is it? Tin, there has been a change of plan. Inform everyone that we're aborting the operation. The management has other plans. Abort the operation? How can we? Commissioner's order. Let Hak Tsai go. Why didn't you call earlier? We have taken action already. Action. Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. Chow, a change of plan. Follow Hak Tsai. Take him with you when we burst in. Police, drop your weapons. Surrender now. You cheater! You cheated. Bastard! You jerk! - He took my money! - No. Forget it! He took my money! Stay where you are! Freeze! Stop. Go. Don't look back. Open it! Hang in there! Freaking police! Police. Freeze! - Stay still. - Stay still. Stop! Chow, take his gun. Take his gun! Run! Chow, run! Hurry up! Run! What are you doing? Got cold feet? Run! Quick. Run. Darn it. What are you doing? Just run! We were one flimsy door away from the drug lords. We couldn't just call it off! Our fingers were already on the triggers. You could have gotten them all killed, Superintendent Wong! Commissioner Tang. It's too dangerous for our teams to stop the operation at the last minute. Yes, sir. I'll write you a report. Thank you, sir. You are in a disciplinary squad. An order is an order and must be followed. We're talking about human lives! Just stop the operation? I don't want to see my undercover guy in a morgue. What now? Spit it out. Wei Xin-guang. Eight-faced Buddha? You know him. He's one of the biggest drug lords in Asia. He was at the Thai-Cambodian border when we lost track of him. But two days ago, Interpol found a Thai drug dealer called Bobby. He is hooking up Hak Tsai with Eight-faced Buddha. We asked you to let Hak Tsai go because we want to uproot the big boss, not the small crooks. Your undercover guy didn't pass on such important info? My undercover guy was very busy. Thank you. Would you stop wearing jeans at home? They're too tight and you are pregnant. What did you make? Pork shin soup with carrots. Awesome. Remember to stay away from Job's tears and hawthorn, okay? Did you get all these yourself? Buy a little at a time, okay? It's dangerous to carry so much all by yourself. Would you like a domestic helper? Don't cry. It's bad for the baby. Bad for the baby. I know it's bad for the baby. That's why I hold back whenever I want to cry. I know crying is bad for the baby. When I had morning sickness, I hoped you would be here with me, but you never were. When the baby kicked me for the first time, I was so happy and called you right away. But your voice mail was all I got. I am eight months pregnant, and you have only been back three times. Once dead drunk. Twice injured. What can I do? Honey, I promise. I'll spend more time at home with you. I will be by your side when you give birth to our baby. Okay? Don't cry anymore. - How dare you come here? - Hey. Chow, no. Stop it. Are you here to blow my cover? You said you would arrest them. Were you toying with me? Calm down. Calm down? He shot me in the head. That gunshot saved your life. Anyway, I'm quitting. You can't catch every criminal in the world. You know how my life has been these past few years. I worked my tail off so that you can look good during your promotion interview. I'm always beating people or being beaten. I'm so sick of it. I really am. You know my wife is pregnant. I can't even spend time with her. My dearest Tin, I beg you. Let me live a normal life. Let me go back on the force. - Please. - I understand. I want you back too. I want the three of us to work, get promoted, and have drinks together. But we can't. The case isn't over. Our target is Eight-faced Buddha, the drug lord in Southeast Asia. Do you know about him? No, I've heard nothing. Anyway, I'm quitting. Chow. Listen to me. Hak Tsai isn't dumb. If you suddenly quit after all these years, what would he think? You'll be exposed as a traitor. You can't arrest him, and he won't let you off the hook. You could lose everything. So I don't have a choice because I'm dead either way? Why don't you just kill me now? You do have a choice. You can choose to quit. He has a choice too. If you quit, I'll find a replacement. He'll live like you, leaving family and friends behind. He'll live miserably for years until we can arrest Eight-faced Buddha. Go ahead and find a replacement. That's none of my business. But you are a cop. It's fine if you're mad. I am too. But don't whine. Sworn to tread the mountain of swords, right? With courage, overcome a thousand barriers Lofty spirits and unswerving pride Travel back and forth between hells alone -Still crave to visit the tiger cave -Still crave to visit the tiger cave -For once -For once What? We've been singing it all these years. ...when to return Too bad, intoxication doesn't last forever -Regret that we haven't met any earlier -Regret that we haven't met any earlier Sworn to tread the mountain of swords Your turn. So Kin-chow. Please don't come to me anymore. Don't give me false hope and let me down again. Let's just break up for good. Bangkok Eight-faced Buddha's original name is Wei Xin-guang, and he's three-quarters Chinese. He's the most powerful drug lord in the Golden Triangle area since Khun Sa's military surrender in 1996. Although the Golden Triangle's opium output has decreased to its lowest level in a hundred years, following Thaksin Shinawatra's war on drugs and the UN Narcotics' replacement planting project, Buddha remains the only active warlord in the drug trade with his own army and farmers. Gentlemen, I'm Richard Robinson from the Interpol. And I'm in charge of arranging the joint operation between Hong Kong and Thailand. Mr. Choowit from the Thai police is the commanding officer, and Mr. Ma from Hong Kong is responsible for supplying the intel on the drug dealers. Mr. Commanding Officer, I would like to request a gun. And I want to be in charge of the tailing operation. The undercover is our man. I have to make sure he's kept safe. Mr. Ma. I hope you understand that Hong Kong police is only responsible for providing intel for this joint operation. This is Bangkok. We have to lead the operation. In terms of guns, overseas intel officers cannot carry any weapon. But rest assured, you won't need it. We already have your undercover's details from the Hong Kong Police. We'll keep him safe. We'll let you assist the operation, and Chatchai will help you. Good. Thank you. Fine. Let's go. Hak Tsai. How are you? It has been a while. What took you so long? I thought you drowned in the Mekong River. Hak Tsai, you lost millions of dollars, but you're still composed and in control. You have my respect. Don't remind me. Now I have to run the errands myself. By the way, this is Chow. - Chow. - My very good friend. We've survived bullets together. Forget about the millions you lost. From now on, come find me in Thailand whenever you need heroin. Hey, Bobby. I'm not buying milk formula. Could you just take it down a notch? Hak Tsai. This is Thailand, not Hong Kong. Now, I'm taking you to the world's best heroin! Hak Tsai. Yes? As agreed, we will pool in 10 million US dollars each. I am an honest guy. When the deal is done, I'll charge you a 20% commission. Sure, whatever. I'll give you 20%. There's no signal. Go after them. Go after them! What the heck are you doing? You can't even drive? Stupid moron. Go find me a car. - Sorry. - A car! Sorry. Okay. - A car! - I will find it right now, okay? He takes half in advance? Why didn't you tell me upfront? If he takes my money and leaves, what can I do? Rules are rules. I've been doing business with him. I'm sure it will be fine. What? Are you scared? Don't worry. Listen. You're alive as long as I live. If things go down, I'll take care of it, okay? Database login All right. Just calm down. I understand. No one wants accidents to happen. I will send someone over right away. Found it yet? No, not yet. Send it to me once you find it. Hello? What's the matter? Hi, Boss. There's an undercover cop among your clients from Hong Kong. I couldn't call you until now. I'll find out who he is and send his photo right away. Holy cow. I'm so dead. I'm in the abandoned car park meeting with them. Send me the picture quickly. I will. Bye. I understand Thai. What are you doing? You work for Bobby. He works for Bobby. Where is Bobby? - Where is he? - I don't know. Where's Bobby? Where is he? - I don't know what you are talking about. - Where's Bobby? - I don't know. - Where... Don't move. Calm down. Easy. Don't move. Squat. Guns down. - Squat, guns down. - I said don't move. Don't move. Hello. Hi, I am the daughter of Buddha. What did she say? She is Buddha's daughter. Hello. Hello. I'm Mina. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Is she really Buddha's daughter? She's smoking hot, man. Looks like she has a crush on me. She is a man. What? - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Hak Tsai. He's Eight-faced Buddha's son, Sarit. Hello. Have you brought the money? Yes, boss. Come on, bring it over. Yes, boss. Quick. Database login Tell me where Bobby is, or I'll beat the shit out of you. You don't want to live? Spit it out. Push his head out. Say something, please. Say it now! Okay, I will bring you there! Where? Okay. Make a right turn in front. Drive on for two blocks. It's an abandoned car park. Turn right, two blocks ahead. An abandoned car park. Boss. That's correct. All right. This is a satellite phone for you. The dealing place and time tomorrow. My dad will call you and explain. Thank you very much. Okay, bye-bye. See you tomorrow, handsome. Throw him off the building! - What are you doing? Let me go. - Toss him! - What was that? - Let go! I said throw him off. He's an undercover cop, and you brought him to Thailand, idiot. Don't trust him. He's robbing us of our stuff. Bobby, you are keeping our drug. You boldfaced liar. Don't drag me into this. You're messing with Eight-faced Buddha. So? Get your hands off him. I have an informant in the police. I'll let you die with no regrets. Gosh, you are the cop? Are you insane? Go die! Run them over! Traitor! Chow. Knock him down! Hold on, Chow! It hurts. It hurts. It hurts. Mr. Ma, you're holding a Thai policeman hostage. This is a serious crime. Your man is a mole. He sold intel about the joint action. I know. I have all the evidence. You are lucky if you get to keep your job. So what do you want? I am one call away from busting this deal. I am leading this operation. You have to support us. This is our last chance. Okay. Chow. - Do you still want to go on? - Stop! - Calm down, Chow. - Shut up. Hak Tsai is already dead, and you still want to go on? Yes. We haven't caught Eight-faced Buddha yet. You can't mess with Buddha. This is Thailand, not Hong Kong. Buddha's son and daughter saw Hak Tsai and my face just now. I'm not doing this. You do it yourself! Calm down. There must be a way out. Bobby and the money are here. We are just one step away from busting them. I tell you, we can make it. You can follow the case all by yourself. I'm not risking my life for you. You bastard don't have family, but I do. I'm going back to Hong Kong. Grow up, won't you? You want sweet talk all the time? Did it scare you, my dear? - I'm going back. - Stomping your feet like a kid? Are you crying? I'm going back! We are on the Narcotics Squad. If we don't do it, Hong Kong will be ruled by drug lords. We must do what should be done. Even if we lose the battle, we have no regrets. - You cold-blooded bastard! - Stop! - Stop it. Don't fight! - Stop it, Chow! - Calm down. Don't fight now. - Stop. - Stop fighting! - Chow. Let go! Calm down, okay? Come on. Let's fight. I have put down my guns. Come on. - Calm down. - No, Chow. Don't do it. - Let go of me! - Stop. Why do you take his side every time? No, I'm on your side. But we are cops after all. We'll talk like civilized people, okay? Let's get something to eat and talk it over, okay? That's right, we're starving. Let's go eat first and talk later. Hello? Can I speak to Mr. So Kin-chow, please? Speaking. Ms. Chan from the hospital? Your wife has delivered a healthy baby, but she had excessive bleeding after delivery. Please come and see her soon. Okay, thank you. Hello. Uncle Buddha. Yes, it's Bobby here. Sure. In two hours. An abandoned village 20 km north of the red-earth forest. Thank you. See you. Listen, guys. Don't go there. You will get yourselves killed. You're dead meat. Either hung after a trial or killed by Buddha. I'm your savior. - You guys are real bastards. - Shut up! Bobby is willing to be a state witness. It's 2 hours from now. 20 km north. An abandoned village in the red-earth forest. I have notified the Thai police. You decide if you go or not. When I was 13, I hung out with you two. I followed you everywhere. My dad died early, so I treated you like my blood brothers since little. One is smart, the other is a good fighter. We grew up together and became policemen. You applied to be an inspector, while you dropped out eight weeks before passing out. Everyone knew you were recruited as an undercover. I wanted to be an undercover. I was so jealous. But then, I'm content with whatever I have. I am a simple guy. Since the first day I walked the beat with my uniform on, I told myself I must be a good cop. My late dad always said, "Just focus on one thing, and that's good enough." So? Are you going or not? Yes, of course. I'll go too. Mr. Ma, you understand, this is an exceptional case. Follow me. This is Bobby, he is going to help us find Eight-faced Buddha, all right? - Hello. - Hey. - Deal is called off. - What? Deal is called off. It's out of the bag. - Are you toying with me? - It hurts! How could I have pulled it off? Then why did no one show up? I don't know. Buddha has never stood me up. I don't even see a dog around. If he doesn't show up, I'll dig a hole and bury you alive. It hurts! It hurts! Target approaching. Here he comes. Get off. Chow, stay alert. We must pull it off this time. Drop the pretense. Let's go. Eight-faced Buddha isn't here. Those two are his sons. Hello there. We meet again. Your partner we met yesterday, where is he? He couldn't make it today. We will take care of things for him. He's not showing up after paying the deposit? What are you guys thinking? He asked why Hak Tsai didn't come. We killed him. He was killed. Why? Why? We want to keep his share. We want to keep his share. I like your honesty. Show them the stuff. We'll check the stuff. Where's the money? Money. Police. Drop your weapon! Don't move! Drop your weapon! Action! - Drop your weapon! - Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Drop your weapon! Don't shoot! You have been surrounded. Surrender. Wai, drive over here. Quickly! You guys get on first. Now run! Get on. Get on, Yik. Get on. Yik! Yik! Yik! - Hold on. - Start the car! Yik. You brought the police here to catch me? Please don't kill me. Drag him in. Quick. - Yik, hang in there. - I won't make it. - Quick. - Go without me. - Hold on. - Don't let go. Faster! Let go... Yik! A gun. Give me a gun. A gun. You jerk. You killed Yik! Sit tight! Madam is in the car. Be careful. Chow! Come up. Is everyone okay? Let them go! I said let them go! I'm going to kill her! Do you want to see that? Do you want to see that? I'm going to kill her. Now! Dad. Uncle Buddha, forgive me. It was not me. They forced me. For the sake of my dad, please forgive me. Uncle Buddha, could you forgive me? Please forgive me. Bobby, I've known you since you were a kid, and I've taught you that credibility is important for running a business. You can't sell your mates out. You must keep your promise. Surrender now if you don't want your daughter dead! In the Golden Triangle, credibility is a matter of life and death. That's why I value credibility when running my business. I'll only say it once. You let my daughter go, and I'll let one of them go with you. No. Get us a car. All three of us will leave. Three for one? That doesn't sound fair to me. You can tell who has the upper hand. Don't bargain with me. One life for one life. I will count down from three. If you kill my daughter, both your friends will die. One for one. I'm not leaving. Let the two of them go. That's it. I'm staying. They leave. I'm not choosing. I'm not going to choose! Three. Two. I'm not risking my life for you. You bastard don't have family, but I do. I'm going back to Hong Kong. My dad died early, so I treated you like my blood brothers since little. One. He stays. Dad, there are no bullets in the gun. Do you know why I won't kill you? Because you'll have a fate worse than death. I remember on my first day of walking the beat... Hey, Tin! You came just in time. I gave out five parking tickets in a day. But then, four of the cars were stolen, and the remaining one was Tin's. Chief Inspector Ma Ho-tin, you were in charge of this operation in Thailand. Two Hong Kong police officers died during the operation, while the target suspect, Wei Xin-guang, also known as Eight-faced Buddha, is still on the run. The Chief Executive received a complaint from the Thai Police, saying the failure of this operation is solely attributed to your wrong judgment and domineering behavior. The operation has caused major loss of lives of the Thai police force. They vigorously denounced our negligence. Your deposition suggests the operation was disclosed to the suspects prior. Did you ever suspect your teammate of making a mistake? Yes. That would be me. I take full responsibility for it. I underestimated them. I was arrogant. I request that So Kin-chow resume his duty as a proper officer immediately. Over the years of his work, he achieved major merits. I urge the Hong Kong Police to keep our promise by promoting him. Dear family, friends, colleagues. Today, we mourn the loss of our outstanding colleagues, Wong Shun-yik and Cheung Tsz-wai, with deep sorrow and absolute respect. They have been working in the Narcotics Bureau of Hong Kong Police, striving to make Hong Kong a safe and just society for its citizens. At work, Mr. Wong Shun-yik was an experienced, diligent, and quiet officer. At home, he was a loving dad who took care of his family. Mom. Why weren't you the one who died? Why weren't you? Give me back my husband! How am I supposed to live without him? Hey, Mrs. Cheung. I am Chow. Wai's best friend. Remember? I'm Chow. Wai sent me here. Your son is brilliant and got promoted. He went abroad to study. That's why he couldn't come to see you. It's getting cold. Put on something warm, son. Wai asked you not to worry about him. If you need anything or someone to talk to, you can call me. Son, I did call you. But why didn't you answer my calls? Mom. Don't call my old number. I have a new number. Just call me on this one. It's a new number. I'll put it on your headboard. Call me if you need anything. Five years later Drugs confiscated. No one was arrested. - Cartel leader kidnapped. - This is urgent. Thank you. Chow is the star. One time, it was two speedboats in Aberdeen that carried over three million worth of ketamine. Last year, in a joint operation with Japan, he confiscated over 80 million worth of heroin. Brilliant. - Come on, take a seat. - Thank you, sir. Bounce, little bunny. Okay. Bounce, little bunny. - Did the teacher praise you today? - Yes. Did you miss me? Are you a little bunny? Yes, you are. Don't rush it. Start with this note. Start from here. Good. Hi. This is Ms. Yuan. Hi, Ms. Yuan. Hello. You're bringing kids over again? Yes. I have an aunt whose daughter wants to learn zither, so I'm taking her here for classes. Come on in. Let's put you in a class first. Siu-yue, take her to fill out the forms. Okay. I bought a cake for you and Woon-woon. Woon-woon isn't here. To be honest, you don't have to introduce your friends' children to learn zither here. She is the twelfth kid you brought in this month from your fourth aunt. This coming Sunday is Woon-woon's birthday. I want to have dinner with you and Woon-woon. Okay? That was ages ago, Chloe. Don't you think I'm different now? I don't want Woon-woon to call me Uncle. I really want her to call me Dad. Please give me another chance. Let her call me Dad, okay? Chow. My life with just Woon-woon is stable and content. I don't want to live like the old days. So it's best that you stop giving me false hope. Thanks to Buddha's help all these years, I have sources for quality stuff like this. You're welcome. We have the best stuff for sure. You are our long-term customer. I must offer you a good price. Thank you very much. Who are you? Boss, it sounds like he is asking who you are. Dune Kun from Tsim Sha Tsui. Sir, ten deceased, six Thais, and four Hongkongers. All Thais have Eight-faced Buddha's symbol tattooed on them. At 5:30 a.m., fishermen towing fish near Lema Island came across the bodies. The Marine retrieved two more bodies in the waters near Dai Dong Bay. Preliminary investigation suggests that they were shot to death by firearm. We also found drug wrappers like this on the bodies. Show them the stuff. Inspector Ma, this is against the rules. You're putting us in a difficult position, sir. Inspector So said you can't work on this case. Calm down, Inspector Ma. - How many suspects are there? - Stand back. Chow. Chow. Buddha's son is dead. The drugs were stolen. He won't let this go. He will make the biggest fuss. So? So he will show up and get his drugs back. And then the two gangs will fight. Dune Kun from Tsim Sha Tsui was behind this. Grab his sidekicks and grill them three times a day. You will get clues. But why do you care? You are in charge of data processing now. We, the operation division, have to do things according to the rules. But you always do things gratuitously. You lead the Narcotics Bureau. If you don't arrest drug lords, what else will you do? I can do whatever. It's none of your business. - I don't report to you. - He was in Thailand five years ago. Now, he's here in Hong Kong. We must arrest him. Stop saying "we." I'm not in your league. There is no more "we." Okay? Chow. We can... Sorry. If the murderer is caught before Eight-faced Buddha finds him, we can set Buddha up and arrest him. I want to come back and help. I can do anything you want me to. Even just as a driver is fine. We have to take revenge, Chow. Revenge? How are you so naive? You are a police officer, not a gangster. I will never trust you again. So you'd better hide any endeavor beyond your jurisdiction well enough from me. Or else, I will report it for sure. Okay? I must do what I should do. Even if I fail, I'll accept it. Hey, have you gotten any news? What? He had stock, and it's that cheap? He's going to Taiwan? Is that true? Tin, this is all I found out. He reserved a jet boat for tonight, leaving for Taiwan. Okay. As long as I arrive there safely and get the money, I will tell you where the stuff is. No problem. That's it. Idiot! Why isn't the boat here yet? Boss, I told them to come at 12 p.m. - Maybe there was an accident... - Don't make excuses. My dear boss. Would you mind calling to rush them, please? Okay. Hey, you! Why don't you just come next year? Boss, the boat is here. - What is this? - Let him go. Don't mess with us! Who the heck are you? - Shoot if you dare. - Throw the guns into the sea. Don't do anything. You are so dead. - Throw them into the sea! - Stop! Okay. You guys, drop the guns. Do you bastards want me to get killed? Drop the guns. Drop them! You bastard. Who are you? - I am Dune Kun from Tsim Sha Tsui. - Dune Kun? I'm from the Narcotics Bureau. You must find a guy for me. Are you out of your mind? You have five bullets. You can't beat my guys. How about this? You let me go. I'll give you 100 million cash. Only 100 million? Are you kidding me? Get out of my way! Dune Kun, right? Boss! Action. - Police. Freeze! - Freeze! No one robs from Eight-faced Buddha unless someone else is behind this. Who is it? Who is it? Calm down, sir! Let go, sir! Don't do that, sir. Who is it? Tin. Who? You are a real psycho. - Let me go! - Psycho! Go, hurry up. - Just go. Stop talking. - Go. Move. - Do you have a cigarette? - Shut up. Get in the car. I want a cigarette. Dune Kun just got busted. Don't show your face. Just leave now. Let's go. Sir. Sir. Sir! Take the suspects back. How have you been? How about you? Good? Yes, quite good. Boy or girl? Girl. Congratulations. Were you behind all this recent mess? Are you working for Eight-faced Buddha? - If so, I have to arrest you. - Chow. I have to arrest you. We haven't met for five years, and this is how you greet a long-lost friend? Do you know why our operation failed five years ago? Why? Because someone called Eight-faced Buddha and told him the deal was out of the bag, calling the deal off. That's why Buddha sent his mercenaries to save his son and daughter. What was that? What did you say? What? What are you trying to say? I'll tell you. Don't try to make us fight. Now you say it out loud. Who made that call? Say it. Well, I knew nothing actually. It was my wife who told me this. Yes, I'm married to Buddha's daughter. - So? - I don't know what you're saying. I don't know what you're talking about. If you don't know what I'm talking about, you should arrest me. Go ahead. Wai. Wai is dead. That was the choice you made, my idol. Dune Kun must die, I tell you. Even Jesus Christ can't save him. You have my word. Sworn to tread the mountain of swords With courage... What did he say? What did he say? -Skillful phenomena, unskillful phenomena, -Skillful phenomena, unskillful phenomena, - undeclared phenomena. - undeclared phenomena. -Skillful phenomena, unskillful phenomena, -Skillful phenomena, unskillful phenomena, - undeclared phenomena. - undeclared phenomena. - Skillful phenomena, unskillful phenomena. - Skillful phenomena, unskillful phenomena. How can Dune Kun be alive? You idiot! No, Samak. I saw those cops who took Dune Kun away. They were your old-time buddies. Are you selling us out? I came back to kill them both. - Dad. - Dad. Sorry, Father. Dune Kun was arrested by the police. Light it up. They are the wife and daughter of that cop. You know what to do with them, right? Yes, sure. Father, let me do it. I've been waiting for this day. Sure. You do it. No! Go. Sir, Crime Unit will pick up Dune Kun soon. Why do you want him here? - Sir, this is against the rules. - Where are we going? Go back. I have him. Where to? The same old place. What happened to you two? You used an illegal firearm, and Chow kidnapped a suspect. Kidnap? Chow kidnapped Dune Kun. I'm asking you. Do you know what's going on? Did you contact Chloe and their daughter? We tried, but we couldn't find them. This is bad. Buddha could have kidnapped them to threaten Chow. Go and get some help. Now. Do something! Chan! Open the door. Cheung Tsz-wai is alive. He's working for Buddha. Send people around to look for him. Lend me your pen. Quickly. Inspector Ma, please. This is not funny. I'm not being funny. Do as I say. Open the door. Open it! Drop the key. Sir. - Inspector Ma. - Don't come any closer. Calm down. I will slit his throat. Open the door. Calm down. Give me the keys. Be careful. You have borne with me all these years. Thank you. - Sir. - Calling headquarters. I'm so dizzy. - Sir, are you okay? - Call an ambulance. Yes, sir. - Uncle Chow! - Chow, save Woon-woon! Let them go. - Uncle Chow! - Save Woon-woon! - Chow, save Woon-woon! - Uncle Chow! Let them go. Are you pointing a gun at me again? Take it out on me if you must. But leave them alone. Put the gun down first. - Chow, save Woon-woon! Save her! - Mom! Mom! All right! I'll put it down. I've called your men. They'll take you away soon. Thank you, man. Let them go. Let them go! One life for one life. Make a choice. Make a choice. I'm not choosing. Kill me if you want to. Count me in. We have two now. Two lives for two lives. You can let them go now. Tin, I knew you would come. But see who has the upper hand here. You don't have a say. You're not even a man. You can take it out on us. His wife and daughter are innocent. This is how the world works. I didn't have a choice. And you think you deserve to choose? Yes, you didn't get to choose and it was sad. But it doesn't give you the right to kill people. How about me? When I was in Thailand, all I got was an empty gun. I had to make a choice between you two. I knew I would regret it no matter what. What? You have your point. You saved Chow and now, he has a lovely family. You are such a savior. But why couldn't that be me? Tsz-wai. If I saved you five years ago and let him die, would you be happier these years? Five years. Five years! Do you know how I lived? Do you? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have given you up. I also owe Chow too much. I shouldn't have forced him... That's enough! It was my fault. I called Buddha five years ago to inform him of the operation. I'm sorry. All those years as an undercover, I had been missing my wife and my home every day. Even when my wife gave birth to my daughter, I wasn't there with them. It's true. I wanted to save my life in Thailand. I just wanted to call off the deal and come home safely. I didn't know I would get my friends killed. For five years, I've been haunted by guilt and regret. I couldn't even stand looking at him. All I could do was lie to myself, telling myself I didn't do it. I really wish I was the one who died in Thailand. I wish I was the one who fell into the crocodile pond. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Go and save our boss! Alpha team on the family. Bravo on me, move. That was all I needed to hear. Go see your mom in the hospital. Kill them all. Wait for me here. You're the man. From now on, anyone who messes with you is messing with me, Dune Kun. As long as we work together, I'm not Dune Kun from Tsim Sha Tsui. No, from Hong Kong. - Okay. - No. We can rule the world. Isn't that great? Yes, it is. - Sit here. - Give me a gun. In a minute. Just wait for me. Okay. Come back soon. I'll wait. Come back soon. I will. The whole world... Call him Dad. He is your dad. Dad. Take care of our daughter. My good girl. Dr. Cheung. You're here. Brace yourself, it's almost time. Tsz-wai. You're here at last. Son. They said you went abroad to study. You are such a great kid. Tell me about it. I want to know more. Sorry, Mom. I left you here and didn't take care of you. Let me give you kisses. I promise I'll be a good cop. I never gave up. Don't worry. Tin, how about you? Mrs. Cheung. I owe Wai so much. I sacrificed Wai for Chow's family. But I want him to know that no matter which choice I made, my heart breaks either way. I'm Chow. I'm back together with my wife. My daughter is a good and clever kid. I was not afraid to die. I just didn't want to lose my family. I did something that harmed my best friends. I feel guilty. I want them to forgive me. It's okay. Best friends always forgive. You should cherish your friendship, okay? We will. Don't worry. Give me your hands. Luckily, the bullet only hit my breastbone. I survived such an event. Maybe God wants me to do something for him. Stay in this village or even I can't protect you. Because I saved Mina before, she took me back to the village. I had to live, and Mina was my only chance. Aim and... Do it. Then I started working for Eight-faced Buddha. For the past five years, I've killed many people for him and passed so many drugs over the counter. But he's really cunning. I've only seen him in person twice. I let Dune Kun snatch Buddha's drugs and kill his son to make him show up. You had a plan. You should have counted us in on it. I don't want to drag you into this. Chow kidnapped a suspect. I'm a prisoner on the run. You are a drug dealer. We don't have much else to do if we're alive. Tonight, Buddha will be in Macau, hosting religious rituals for his dead son. This is our last chance. But I'm not sure if he will show up. You decide whether you go or not. The Fully Awakened One. Homage to the Blessed One, the Perfected One, the Fully Awakened One. Any wrong actions... Tsz-wai, Buddha is asking for you. Cheung Tsz-wai. I asked Master Tsan-lim here from afar to bless my late son. But he disclosed a shocking divination. My son was killed by someone in the family. I've said that I would do anything to get rid of anyone who harms my family. Cheung Tsz-wai, did you do it? No, Father. I didn't. Okay. If you are innocent, cut your arm off to swear your allegiance to me. I'll let you in and see me after that. If you really are innocent, I will pass my business to you and Mina. You are the boss from now on. Come on in. You're the one behind the Dune Kun episode. You're the one who planned the death of my son. If it weren't for Mina, you would already be a dead man. After I took care of you for years, you're turning your back against me? Justice? What a moron. I am. So I am here to end your life. You idiot. Run. Remember when we once played soccer in Tsz Wan Shan? Yes, I do. We lost the match, and you beat the opponents up. They played dirty. They were asking for it. Should I have bought them dinner instead? Actually, they didn't play too dirty. We just couldn't accept our loss. So we took it out on them. You may lose the game, but not the spirit. Don't lose the spirit. Let's get started! Sworn to tread the mountain of swords With courage, overcome a thousand barriers Lofty spirits and unswerving pride Travel back and forth between hells alone Still crave to visit the tiger cave for once Leave this morning not knowing when to return Too bad, intoxication doesn't last forever Regret that we haven't met any earlier Wish to have a drink with you Remember how we parted and met Long live the unswerving pride and fraternity It's never too late to know you well You old fart! Come on out! Come out. It gets on my nerve when I see your freaking hair. What hairdresser on earth would do that? You think I don't dare? How can you still be alive? You bastards are trying to make me show up. I've been in this business for years. Do you think you have what it takes to arrest me? Especially you, Cheung Tsz-wai. You played dirty tricks on me. But I'm still standing. So? Cut the crap. Go and style your hair before showing your face. I shouldn't have let you live five years ago. If I don't blow you three bastards to death today, how can I sleep tonight? Kill them! Samak, no! Samak, please don't! Samak, stop! Samak, stop! Mina! Never mind. The choice I made this time at least earned us a penalty kick. I am so tired. I'm out of bullets again. We're just one step away. Chow. Let me choose again. Go and die, you bastard! Chow! Forgive me for being reckless and absurd Forgive me for being too weak and burdensome Our friendship lasts Beyond time In the mountain of swords in the ocean of flame With you, I never cringe One day, we'd make it to the sunset hues Drink without worries Sing without caring for the pitches That moment is priceless One day, we'd earn the cheers And hug with a knowing wink Those youthful days with passion Were never wasted
