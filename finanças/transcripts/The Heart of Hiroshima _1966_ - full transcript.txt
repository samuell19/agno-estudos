A NIKKATSU PRODUCTION AI TO SHI NO KUROKI A Record of Love and Death (AKA The Heart of Hiroshima) Uji... Can you lend me some money? I'll give it back at the hostel. What's it for? - Compensation. For what? - A record. Record? I can replace it at cost price. No sweat. My girlfriend works at a record store. It'll hassle you. Cost price is 600 yen cheaper. - Just give me the loan. Why should you pay compensation? - Come on! You're a strange guy. Thank you! Sorry about this morning. Here. But... I didn't ask you for money. Take it. It'll make me feel better. It was at cost price. I don't need so much. It's okay... if there's extra it's compensation. Compensation? A split second either way... and I might have injured you. I don't want compensation. Don't want? - Take it back. For a man, once given is given. - Don't be so stubborn. I'm not stubborn. Wait up. Here it is. Thanks. So you... forced her to accept the compensation. How do you know? I'm clairvoyant. Were you watching? You don't say 'compensation' talking to a new girl. She'll misunderstand. So you know what happened? This morning you carelessly bumped someone, right? Nice girl. You know her? I told you... my girlfriend works in a record shop. So she's your girlfriend? You look all disappointed. - Don't misjudge me. You handed her... 2,000 yen and ran off. The girl said... it's too much and she'd return it. I said I'd do it. She said no matter what, she'd return it herself. What d'you think? About what? - You'll see her again? What's the point? She's your girl. You're such a wimp! You jerk! Ouch. NAKAMOTO SOGO PRINTERS Hey... Yukio. This is very well done. Such subtle tones. That's great. In future... they'll send you to a technical college... up in Tokyo. Maybe so. A model employee, exceptional. Too lazy to follow technique, you get left behind... no? Hey... Tonight at 7, she'll wait in the same place. Nothing to do with me. I'd get in the way if I come. Really? These days... we're not getting on so well. Hello. Is this Juji Music? Ah Fumi-Chan? Right. Everything's fine. All you do is laugh. It's a bit strange here. She's coming over. Ya. She believes whatever I tell her. I told her my boyfriend's a playboy. So be careful. So she said I had to come with her. And then...? I said I was bored with you. If you want him you can have him. You're a terrible girl. See you then. Later. Seems like you're having fun. What is it? Another day over. Must be the season. Making yourself pretty! Sorry about yesterday. I... feel awkward. Why? Though you're Fumiko's friend... you asked to see me alone. Fumiko? Here. You should only pay cost price... the balance. Is that all? What's that mean? Is that why you called me? You said you wanted to meet me here. You... don't make a fool of me. It was you called me. You're strange. Make a fool of you? Me? I'd never fool an unknown girl. I really didn't know you were Fujii's friend, till he said so... just last night. So you aren't Mr. Fujii? So you don't know Fujii? So you aren't Miss Fumiko? I'm Kazue... MATSUI Kazue. Fumiko is my co-worker. You're not Mr. Fujii? I'm MIHARA Yukio. Fujii is a friend at work. What's it all mean then? I thought I should pay back the balance. I told Fumiko that you left without saying your name or work. Is that right? Sure it is! So that was it. My... nickname is Bambi. Know why? Bambi? Because you're cute? Am I? Because I'm playful. - Playful Bambi? Your real name? - Kazue. Kazu like the Showa "wa". I'm Yukio. Yuki like "happiness". Yuki like the Miyuki bridge. I love that bridge. Me too. There's a poem about it. 'Yuki' like Miyuki bridge. 'Yuki' in Yukio People say the symbol of Hiroshima is the river. Near my house there's a river. What's it's name? Kyobashi River? - No. Tenma River? - Wrong. - So Outa River. - Yes, near the bridge. Simioshi Bridge. - No. Meiji Bridge. - No, that's on the Motoyasu river. Aioi Bridge? Further up. Misaka bridge - Correct. And you? Company hostel. - Really? Myself... with my family... mother, little brother, older brother and wife. I'm a sister-in-law. Hurry and marry. - I'm not that old yet. My brother's a bit annoying. He's got a job at City Hall... but he's not satisfied. Yukio, do you like records? - Of course. Popular music. - Which ones? Sad songs. Guitar... Forbidden Games. You see it? (Jeux Interdits 1952 - sad theme song.) It was a very nice film. (Jeux Interdit 1952 - sad theme song.) It was so sad about the girl. This is sad music too. 'Path√©tique' TCHAIKOVSKY Do you like... classical? This one... I got at cost price for somebody else. I see. Who? Someone good. Lives near me. Right. I don't really understand classical. No way. That person's a woman. Oh really? You surprise me. Are you really surprised? - Yes. My heart's in pain. - You're full of it! Really. If you don't believe me, feel it. It's improper, no? Your hand's so cold. But my heart is warm. My bad. Still friends then. From 1,000 yen. 250 yen. Wrong change. - Oh. Sorry. Thank you very much. So gaga over Yukio you can't even concentrate. Say it again! What a terrible thing to do! Wasn't I 'cupid' for you two? Better get a kiss from Yocchan. Have you two already kissed? He's a gentleman. A gentleman doesn't kiss? That's something you should ask Fujii. Bambi's such an old fox. You won't me to pinch you again? You better not! See, someone's calling you. - Must be Yocchan. Hello... Juji Music Shop here. Ask him for a ride. Next day off. Okay, okay. Shall I ask Yukio? That so. We'll talk about it then. Oh no. Next day off? You're not free? Mr. Iwari invited me over. Who's he? You going to disappoint her? You're a heartless guy. No. I can go in the evening. So you can go then? Good. Yukio, don't move. - What're you doing? Ouch! Fumiko said I should pinch you. - Why? I should pinch my best friend like Kazue did. Hey there! Why are two good men fighting like dogs? Seaweed, tea rice with cucumber, very fine. Then rice crackers. - I like squid and octopus. Anything pickled in vinegar. All low calorie. You Yocchan? Hot pot, dumplings, meat buns. All Chinese. Cheapest. - No, no. You Yukio? Beef steak, cheese, corned beef. - Wow, so heavy. Your wife will have to work hard. I... grew up in the mountains... near Saijo. My childhood... I remember going by ship. It was an island, your birthplace? What's your... favourite early memory? What? I... can only think about now. Why? That I happened to meet you. Seagulls. It feels good, doesn't it? All of it... everything. Everything. The sky too. The sea and the air. Everything just for us. That one too. That's right. A firm sea breeze. The breeze is jealous of us. It's such a nice smell. Your hair. This moment... now. will stay with me always. forever and ever. I can hear it... deep inside myself... the sound of your words, your voice... just now... forever in my memory. Eternally. What? Ten years from now... how will we remember this? - How...? Will we have separated? Separated? After ten years... it's fate. You'll be someone else. You think we'll separate? That's what you mean? You think that? Why do you say that? About what? Ten years from now. You'll be someone else. Sorry. No... No, no! You haven't said the most important thing yet. We're going back. Yukio... are you angry? I'm sorry. Don't hold so tightly. Our next encounter will be in the afterlife. I don't care! You feeling hot in the rain? Where you staying tonight? - Bug off! Get lucky. - Do your best. Could you get down? - No way. I said I was sorry. Get down. Yukio's heart is cruel. Fool. Total fool. Yukio! I was wrong. Kazue... I like you. I love you. Big brother you're late! - Sorry, sorry. Here, a gift. Oh, Yukio-San. Say thank you to him. - Thank you. Oh, you're soaked. I thought to change, but no time. Give him my 'yukata'. (Summer kimono) Don't bother. - Fool! Take care of your health. - Yes. Why didn't you wait out the rain? Just... I felt like flying through the heavy rain. With Fujii? - No, we came back separately. You're really are crazy. Iwai-San's too old to understand. Yukio... you're acting strangely. So... I'm right. - You're truly amazing, Missus. What for? I took a girl... doubles. She your girlfriend? - Well sort of. Don't ask stupid questions. - Why d'you say "stupid". Yukio's grown up now. No wonder he's looking around. Yukio's not thinking about marriage yet... are you? That's just your own idea... right? Mum, I'm hungry. - Yes, yes yes. It's good... well, let's start. Shall we have a toast? Why are we celebrating? - What? Today? Today is... It's Yukio's... How can I explain it? Today little man... is the day... your dad became my brother. Hey... my dad is my dad. Sounds good... dating in Nishio. By bike... a driving date. Shut up. A junior high student shouldn't care... I know... you'll tell me to study. Adults only have one script. An unmarried young girl... road behind a motorbike. Don't worry about it mother. Girls these days all do it. How many 'cc's was the motor? - Don't know. Bring him over next time. - Shut up. Oh, what a surprise... Hey you... - Not good. Where does this guy work? Printing Press. Name of the company? - Nakamoto Printing. He's in the technical side of photo printing. Full time? Don't know. You don't know. - I don't know about all that. Kazue... You... Kazu-Chan... you shouldn't do that. Don't cut your finger again. Here Kazu-Chan. It's the money for the record the neighbour asked for. So what music did she get. "Pathetique" Tchaikovsky. She's wanted it for a long time. How nice. I want a stereo to play music too. - Me too. They say that piece is also called the "suicide symphony". Fool. Such a recording... - Why? Oh, you don't like it because I said 'suicide'. It happened before but she's not like that now, sister next door. Shut up. No need to get worked up. - Stop it, Kazue. People say all sorts about even small things. You should have a care about your brother's feelings. - Okay, okay. Kazue... at your age you have to start thinking seriously about marriage. Yes. I'm thinking seriously. Oh...? Kazu-Chan... is thinking to bring that boy home one of these days. That person... Mr. MIHARA Yukio. I want brother and mother also to see... the person I chose. To be in love... unless you experience it, you'll never understand. Hey, hey... work, work. A big job is just starting... this big job. MEDICAL REPORT: PHOTOS OF BLOOD CELLS IN RADIATION DISEASE Hematogenetic Malfunction Disease... images. 150 net... original scale is correct. Calculate carefully when minimizing so that the final images have equal colour. It's not my thing. Why's that. It's yours to do, Yukio. These kind of technical photos... a lay person can't be sure what to focus on. If they were nude photos... I'm your specialist. You said you wanted to talk to me. Yes. What happened to your leg. It hurts sometimes. The joint? Maybe I'm working to hard. About that girl... I guessed as much. So... what's it about? I was worried. But I decided I want to marry her. That's why... I really want your approval. I see. I should have... come to you sooner. Well, if you've already decided... In truth it's not my place to say. - But I... More than anyone else I want your approval... and for you to be happy for us. Mr. Iwai... please meet her. You'll be sure to... No, no. Just... Mr. Iwai... Why aren't you happy for us? Please give me a smile. Just wait Yukio. You're right. I'm at fault. No, actually... actually... in your case... somebody has already proposed an arranged marriage. They already asked. And so... I couldn't decide immediately. I couldn't decide. So Yukio... marriage is for life. So don't rush. Take time to think. Bambi, don't get too excited because he proposed to you. A woman's etiquette. I'll take your advice to heart. Again tonight? - Don't worry. It was he who asked me. Well... I wonder. Mr. Iwai... Mr. Iwai! Oh, Yukio. I'm alright. Lie down a second. - Maybe a little. Take it easy. I'll take this one. How much? 360 yen. Just a moment. You happy, Mari-Chan? - Yes. 360 yen. Already one hour late? What happened to him? Here... Thank you very much. Yes, photo department. Outside call? Yes. Hello. MIHARA Yukio is it? So you... are a friend? Yukio's still here in the building. There's no phone there. Well tonight... may not be possible. What happened? Sorry. I'll get ready quickly. Wait for me there. Be sure... wait for me. One woman... putting her fate... in my strength. Mr. Iwai... didn't give his approval eh? Oh right. He's the one who took my call. That was Mr. Iwai. He doesn't have a good opinion of me. I could tell from his tone of voice. Happiness... Eh? What is it? Happiness is everywhere. What do you mean? Weird isn't it? Is there something you can't say? There is. Mr. Iwai is against. The reason is... there's an arranged marriage already. Is that so? What was your answer? I said I needed to think. You need to think? You didn't refuse. Ah... Yukio... You're lying aren't you? You're teasing me. You're lying aren't you? You shouldn't joke about such things. Honestly... I'm not the man you think I am. "Coming together is the beginning of falling apart." This expression is a bit too affected. I don't believe it. Yukio... what happened to you? Tell me. Yukio...! Yukio must have a good reason. He wouldn't even tell me. He probably can't tell you. Some things are hard to say. Is that so? If I knew before I married... the story about your brother and and the neighbour woman... I probably wouldn't have married him. Now I've gotten to know her... to blame him is... But for Yukio to avoid me... there's no such secret with me. Kazu-Chan... if you truly love Yukio... keep quiet and just go. Okay...? say nothing, just meet him. Say Yukio... I've been thinking a lot. thinking... About what? Simply... about that girl. Then you should really meet her. - Right. Only... Mr. Iwai... tell me straight... what on earth's going on. Yukio... your tone is so aggressive. Aggressive...? I... Mr. Iwai... do I have the right to get married... or not? What about it, Mr. Iwai. You're a fool. Fool? To want the truth is foolish? A fool. So I'm a fool? A fool is what you are. A fool... I'm a fool. Bring her... to the house.... Yukio. Understood... this Kazue-San. Yukio called me. Mr. Iwai has agreed to meet... with us. Yukio and me. I've been longing for this day to come. Yukio... finally didn't show. For Yukio... there's still something he can't say... something. He doesn't even go to work. Something's just not right. Hello, Juji shop. Oh it's you, Yoc-Chan. What's up? Ya... ya... What? Yes... Just a minute. Ah... Yukio? What's going on? She's here now. Oh my... why not? Yukio... What happened? Yes. You sure? Yes. Yukio... What is it? I'm worried. So worried, last night I couldn't sleep. Sorry. Why apologize? What are you apologizing for, Yukio? It's just... nothing really. Then apologize as much as you want. INSCRIPTION BEHIND THEM "Give back my father. Give back my mother." "Give back the elderly. Give back the children." "Give back myself to connect to myself. Give back humanity". "As long as there's a world," a human world," "give back our peace, an unbreakable peace." Yukio... What's wrong? Why... don't you talk to me like you used to? Bambi... you have nice childhood memories, don't you? When I was a child? 20 years ago. What are you saying, Yukio? 20 years. 20 years... about 7,101 days. What is it, Yukio? 7,000... How many days was it before that? This sky... this very sky above me... a bright flash! 7,000 days ago. - No way. It must've been beautiful. A thing quite unworldly. Extraordinarily beautiful, they say. To see that... in that moment... a 4,000 degree wave... instantly. I want to see that! ...that thing. Not me! My... father too... mother too.. saw that thing. It burned hideously... that thing. Yukio... I knew it. You wanted to say that. You knew? I was an orphan. An atomic bomb orphan. I left the orphanage. I tried to forget that place. The trauma was too deep to forget completely. When I forget, I'm a normal person. In peoples eyes... in their minds... I become normal, not discriminated against. That's good isn't it? - No. One day I suddenly got a fever. My whole body was weak. It was finally coming out. When they checked, the anemia was due to weak blood cell production. I was admitted to the Atomic Bomb Hospital. After four months I recovered. Somehow I had to carry on. I thought I should learn a technical job. So I joined Mr. Iwai at the printing press. After that my job skills and my health improved. I made monthly payments on a motorbike. Wherever I wanted to go I went full speed. Then you appeared. How wonderful life was. But Bambi... I was always wondering... somewhere inside me. Is it okay? Am I allowed to? I was doing something forbidden! Radiation was in my body. It was there! The radiation! Stupid, stupid. It's stupid! Kazue... Have you been in the museum here? I saw! Just how frightening it is. What radiation does. You can never understand! Whether I understand or not... the love I feel in my heart for you... it hasn't changed. I have to go back to the hospital. A minimum of 300 'roentgen'... (measure of radiation) entered my body. But... there are thousands of people like that. - Ya. Worrying won't make it better. Worry or not, 300 roentgen is still 300 roentgen. What does that have to do with our love? Even the slightest chance... I... If I... I'll wait. I'll get ready and wait. Bambi... If we do it now... we can still... cancel our engagement. HIROSHIMA ATOMIC BOMB HOSPITAL Yukio... - You... came. Doctor... how could it be so soon... a little longer. It's only been 4 years, eh. At that time... why didn't you predict this might come? Mr. Iwai at the time... I took the decision to release young Mr. Mihara... it was my conjecture that... he would be re-admitted within 6 months. But I also saw the possibility... he'd be a father and not be back in 10 years. That's why I spoke to you about all the possibilities... and asked you to give him a job. I don't know how to say it... but somehow... I feel I made a terrible mistake. What are you saying? INTERNAL MEDICINE MIHARA Yukio Mr. Mihara... Dr. Ishida will be in charge of your case. If you need anything please press this button, okay? From now on we're in your care. - And we in yours. Is there a meal you'd prefer? I'll bring it tomorrow. Nothing. - Right. Well then. Miss Matsui... I felt I should meet you. I need to talk to you. Give him up. That's what you want to say. It's very difficult. Please forget... all about him. From now on, you have a full life ahead of you. He won't survive... Yukio? That's... not what I mean. - So why then? If you felt Yukio had a chance, you wouldn't say that. No... actually... even if he gets better... as a radiation sufferer... that is... the roentgen that is to say... for example... genetic problems, etc... I know them very well. Life is long. I'm sorry... I'm really very sorry. So that's why... truly... So he won't... Yukio? Please tell me. Yukio's illness is... In fact I don't know. For me too... I love him. I taught him my job so carefully. It's just that... I have a feeling... I can't be optimistic. Such is my intuition. I... won't stop believing. Yukio will surely be cured. I'll cure him. Please forget him. a full life ahead of you. Please forget all about him. You have a full life ahead of you. ( Note photo/marriage proposal on table.) How far did... your relationship go? I know the limits of love before marriage. So what's your problem? When he entered the Atomic Bomb Hospital, you saw him as broken. It's too much. I said it because I know about radiation sickness. You're all emotional now, but what about when your life's ruined? So listen Kazue... the reverie of young love's fine, but if your baby's deformed, what then? There's nowhere you can go to complain. You're a 20 year old woman. You have to behave like an adult. To think like that is adult? If so, I don't want to be adult. You brat. - Dear! She's too cocky. - That's enough. My... Do what you feel is best. It was a good proposal... but we'll reject it. What a great chance. Such a good proposal has to come at such a bad time. I'll make cranes. I'll make cranes. The time now is 8:15. The clouds are white... the cloths flap in the wind... the sky... You're getting better, grandma. My grand-daughter comes often. My first grandchild. I want to show her how I can walk. Your first grandchild? Yes. You're so young. Because I'm young, I'll get well soon. - Yes, yes. Hopefully you'll get discharged soon. - Thank you. Mr. Mihara, you like the painting? It gives me strength. Such a pretty girl visiting everyday. Better get well soon. Ah, head nurse. Hi. - Yukio. I made cranes. Don't be shy, don't be shy! Do you... know? About what? Yukio... does he have leukemia? "Anyway, you know the outcome." "Better you stay far away." That's what my brother and mother said. Oh my! "If Yukio truly loves you, he will understand," they said. "Surely he'll understand." What do you think? So you'll never come back to the hospital? It hurts me to see Yukio. Yukio hasn't anyone else. He's all alone. But then... I'm lying. I'm lying, Fumiko. Everyone's looking at us. I'm glad. Your heart cries like mine. I'm relieved someone understands. I'm sorry. I couldn't come. I was waiting. Yukio, I'm knitting you a sweater. Look... it's almost ready. My shift ends at 6. Don't be upset. Wait for me... at the usual place. Time? One thirty. It's long... It's a long night. I'm here. Yukio. It's hurts. Pain. Water. Is it too bad, Yukio? You want some medicine? It hurts? Yukio. Yukio. Yukio. Ah... nice breeze. That beach. I remember it. When you get out... let's go on a ship together. Kazu-Chan, I... want to thank you. Kazue... thank you. Why so formal? But I... You're thinking too much. Can you guess what I was thinking yesterday evening? The colour of the curtains... when we get an apartment. You really are a woman. Yukio... do you like violet. So I'll do them in violet. Fumi-Chan has a strange colour sense. Oh ya... she was crying loudly the other day. That girl... who knew she was such a crybaby. Maybe Fuji-San... said something to her. But... We'll be one step ahead and score first. [Get married] Kazue... Already... Yukio... I am your wife. I'm your wife. You look chilled. Shall we go inside? Yukio... you okay? Shall I call the doctor? I'm okay. Miss Matsui... phone for you. I'll be right back, okay? Hello... I'm sorry, sister. There was no way. Last night Yukio was... Even Mother... no? says it's improper for you to stay there. Mentally I'm ready. I'm... not a child anymore. Anyway... it'll be bad if you don't come home. Yes... soon. Yes. Injection. Yukio... be strong. Brother... Fuji will come soon. Where's Kazue? She'll come right away. Yukio... Oi... Yukio. Irodoricom 5mg. Kazue... Kazue. Another morphine. Kazue... Ka... He passed at 2:10. Mihara. Please forgive me. I already knew... Yukio's fate. I'm... close to the hospital director. Three years ago... Yukio was released from the hospital. At that time the director said... the symptoms came out a little, but now he should be normal. But... we can't say... when it will suddenly reappear. Please take good care of him... was what he said. When Yukio... told me about his feelings for you... I really struggled... what to do. What could I tell him? Could I secretly meet you and tell you? No, no. It would've be too cruel to you. On the other hand... No... I was wrong. Yes, that's right. Every time I saw him looking well... I thought he will die... without ever knowing love. What a wretched boy... was all... I could think. In the end... I should have told you earlier. If I couldn't tell you... I should have told your brother or sister-in-law... somehow or other. Please endure this time. If... I had known all that earlier... what would have done? Would I have slowly left him? Could I do that? Do people do that? Is that a loving thing to do? Brother says... my way of thinking... is childish. That love is based on selfish calculations. So then was Yukio... a man that no one should love? Kazue... you are right. You are very right. Yukio's death... they knew four years ago. His death was already foreseen. I cannot answer. I am not god. That's not fair, Doctor. No... The only one who could answer you is god. That's what I meant. For Yukio's marriage... that genetic problems would arise, it was known the possibility was high. To be precise... it's a question of a minute percentage. For that reason alone... to decide not to marry, not to love, isn't something we can say. To assess human love based on a percentage calculation... would be a big mistake, eh? But if we knew about his leukemia... Did you... decide to stop loving Yukio when you became aware of his disease? No. Isn't true love... something above simple physical and material considerations? I want to think that way... and also be that way. For the sake of love, people even commit suicide. - Suicide? It's not that I agree with suicide. It's just that among these suicides... I have seen a few which I couldn't judge as wrong. In fact humankind are still ignorant. Medicine still has far to go to understand radiation sickness. I cannot answer your question without bringing in god. When Mr. Iawai asked for advice about you and Yukio... I was at a loss. As a doctor, I could have cautioned him about the genetic problems. But, to oppose his marriage... By opposing it, I would've been... indirectly confirming his death. That I couldn't do. Whether the decision I made was the right one... that I can't say. Doctor, you are cruel. It is cruel. Atomic weapons, are cruel not only to the victims but to us doctors too. Nothing is more cruel. Actually in this hospital now there are many people... in Yukio's situation. There are people who finish their treatment and return home. I know it... but I cannot say it. To say it out loud... even if the physical isn't dying... can destroy a person's soul, ruin their social life. I can't do that. We doctors are human too. Alright then... I too am in the same group as Yukio. August 6th... at Hiroshima station I was exposed to the flash. Maybe that's why I'm bald. Covered in blood... passing through a radioactive hell I made it to this hospital. Perhaps I was exposed to around 200 roentgen. My chance of contracting leukemia must be higher than for normal people. But I don't brood over it. Yukio, during his short life, lived it the best he could. Today all humanity faces the risk of this kind of danger. I just tell myself that I have no choice. I have to fight against radiation sickness. Well then... I know you are in a lot of pain, but you have to overcome your grief. You have to start over. What's the matter? I feel I'm going mad. Sorry doctor. I didn't know anything. This one has a punch to it. It sends me. I'll take this one. What about this one? - No it's nothing. This one is good. This is the one you liked. No, I never said that. Ya, you did! Who knows? - Here. Right.. Thank you very much. - Thanks. What is love? Do you know Fumiko? Love? That's a tough one. Love is love. That's enough. But Bambi... Even the head doctor couldn't answer. I'm not god, he said. You're crazy, Bambi. Don't worry, Fumi... I'm all cried out after the last few days. Yukio is in heaven. I'm in this world. Everything has to start from that. Yukio, I think... must have been grateful to you. You did a lot for him. Well... try to forget him as soon as you can. If that arranged marriage comes back after six months... your feelings will be more open then. Maybe Yukio also... is praying from the other side... that you will find a happy marriage. Well... if I had listened to you and big brother... I wouldn't have gone through all that. I've had a good experience. That's right... at that time I thought I would be alone all my life. I felt completely hopeless and miserable. I'm ashamed. I'm sorry. It was rude of me to ask that. Now, it's not like that. With my elderly father and mother... I need to keep living. Do your fingers still hurt? Yes they do. When the weather changes. Sister... do you believe in heaven? My attempt to die failed. So I still don't know. I'm leaving. Toshio... what do you want the most right now? Will you buy it? The latest 3-gear cycle. - Okay. Isn't it too expensive? - I'll get it. - Wow, I'm happy. What's the time? - Quarter past. I'll be late for assembly. How many bridges are there in Hiroshima? - The number of bridges? Well... - Fifty. Could there be more? Why do you what to know? - To draw them. Bridge pictures? When I was little, I liked painting. But as I got older, I forgot all about it. Bridge paintings. All Hiroshima's bridges? Each bridge has... a unique shape and atmosphere, right? - Ya. Good eh?
