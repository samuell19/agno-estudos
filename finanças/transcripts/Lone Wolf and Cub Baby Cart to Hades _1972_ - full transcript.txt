The Criterion Collection Toho Company, Ltd. Katsu Productions present The boat is leaving! Here! Come on! Oh, no! You can't bring a cart like that on board! I shall not. Fancy that! Will you stop crying like a baby? You've got clothes, eat fancy food, wear fancy outfits and make a good living. Aren't I right? Careful! Forget it! You've nothing worth saving. Forget it. Omatsu! Thank you. Lone Wolf and Cub Baby Cart To Hades Produced by Shintaro Katsu & Hisaharu Matsubara Original story by Koike Kazuo & Goseki Kojima Director of photography Chishi Makiura Music by Hideaki Sakurai Fight choreography by Eiichi Kusumoto Starring: Tomisaburo Wakayama as Itto Ogami Go Kato as Kanbei Isao Yamagata, Michitaro Mizushima, lchiro Nakaya Akihiro Tomikawa as the Child Directed by Kenji Misumi Don't you get any classy women or young girls coming this way? No need to be so impatient. It's not like we're in a hurry. Why don't we take our time and find some women along the way? Yeah, exactly. Joy is to be found in the moments between jobs. Once we're hired, though, we can't get away with much. It really is hot! How about having a drink with us, Kanbei? No thanks. Don't be like that. Join us, just for a drink. Drink! You're a strange fellow. You don't drink, you don't chase women. Why, then, are you a hired hand? What's in it for you? Look, we hired hands are in the employ of one lord today and another one tomorrow. We're just hired to guard them as they travel between Edo and their fiefs. Nothing but a bunch of temporary hirelings. Even if we wanted positions as normal samurai, the lords are poor and can't afford to give us a yearly stipend. So we're only hired when they need extra men for special occasions. There's prestige in being able to carry two swords, but it doesn't mean you're better than anyone else. You may have been a fine samurai before, but now you're just a hired hand. Why don't you take it easy and have some fun? You make it difficult for us when you act so po-faced! Chasing women is the best part of being in our line of work. If we didn't have that pleasure, we'd have thrown away our swords a long time ago. And the great things is, with all the women out on the road, we can screw around as much as we want and get away with it! No matter what, everything's fine once we're in the retinue of the daimyo who's hired us. Kanbei, come and join us! Oh! Fortune comes to those who wait! What do you want? We're hired hands. Hired hands? Yeah, that's what we are. If it's money you want, I'll give it to you. We don't want no stinking money. We aren't bandits. We won't steal anything. We just want to screw you. Stop! It's not like you're going to lose anything at all. The more you use it, the better it gets! - No! - We're doing you a favour! Somebody! Somebody, help! Help! Mother! I'll report this to the Deputy! What's going to happen if you report us to the Deputy? Because before you can do that, we'll be long gone. So fuck the Deputy, I say! - Come here. - Help, somebody! Why don't you just give up and let us have you? Close your eyes for 1 5 minutes and it'll all be over. Somebody help! Let me go! No! No! Please, not my daughter! No! Let me go! Let me go! Help! How's this? You scum! You scum! How could you do this to my lady and her mother? I'll slice you to death! -I'll kill you! -Wait! If you touch us, do you know what will happen to you? Exactly! We're employed by Lord Mizuno of the Kariya Clan. Your actions are unforgivable! I don't care if you work for Lord Mizuno! I'll kill you all! Stop! Stop! -Kanbei! -Help us! Damn you! Please close your eyes. Kanbei? -You didn't have to kill them. -This is awful. Each of you, take one. If you don't, I'll slay all three of you. You die, Jukkan. Why just me? You picked the short straw. You'll be the thief who attacked a mother and daughter and their companion. After killing the three of them, you were slain by the three of us, who happened to be passing by. That way, the local officers will be satisfied and all will be settled. Help me! I regret that you had to witness this awful scene. Forgive me. You act more like a samurai than a hired hand. "Like a samurai"? I was once in charge of the Okaga Clan of the Maruoka Fief in Echizen. My name is Kanbei Magomura. If I may ask, what is yours? My name is Itto Ogami. Just as I thought. You were once the Official Executioner of the Shogunate. I recall seeing you this past year inside the gates of Edo Castle. I, too, recall hearing your name. I understand you're a matchless master of the Kage Style. You're too kind, sir. A fine warrior of your calibre, why are you a hired hand? We need not concern ourselves with that. For now, I'd like to request a duel. For what reason? Because you have witnessed what I've done here. Whether or not I'm a hired hand, as long as you know who's hired me, then I must protect my master and his clan, like any warrior would, even if it means putting my life on the line. Having said that, I am following the Way of the Warrior. And so, I am requesting a duel. If I let you leave, if I let you live on... No, even if it was done to preserve my master's honour, by killing those innocent people, I have strayed from the Way of the Warrior. Once again, please accept my challenge. Hey, Kanbei is calling you out! -Why don't you have a duel? -Answer us? Silence! He's not your opponent! If perchance I should prevail, rest assured that I will take care of your son as long as I breathe. I ask that there be no need for such concerns. We, father and son, live the life of demons. We're prepared to cross to the netherworld. You live the life of demons? I am inspired by your words. If I am fated to die here, I shall do so without regret. Well, then. Let us begin. This duel... ...we'll call it a draw. For what reason? You are a true warrior, one whom I hope will live on. "A true warrior"? Once again, I have lost a chance to die. Taste good? I bet you've not had rice that often. Women are flowers, and they ought to bloom. Instead of scratching out a living like poor farmers, Iike flowers, you ought to bloom and bring delight to men. That's a better life, I'd say. Your feet must hurt. It's been a long trip. All right, just wait a minute. When your feet are tired, at such times, applying salt and then warming them over a fire will help a lot. Here we are... Let me see your legs. Come on! If you get tired and become unable to walk, I'll be in deep trouble. So just be still. It won't take long to make them better. What's wrong with you? Stop! -Be quiet! -No! I bought you, you belong to me! I can use you however I please! There's blood on you. Room inspection! Please excuse us. There's been a murder. We're searching for a female culprit. We must check this room, too. Wait. What if the culprit isn't found in here? We're here to conduct an investigation. Do you wish to make a complaint? This is not a complaint. Even though this is an inn, as long as I've paid for this room, this is my home, this is my castle. Whether you're officers or not, you must respect that. That is what I am asking of you. A damned ronin like you shouldn't talk to me like that! What if the suspect is in there? It's equally criminal to hide a suspect, is it not? Exactly! Allow me to check. If she's not here, then you can have my head. No complaints! -What's this? -He's been a bad boy. Your head....I'll claim it now. Move aside! It's safe to leave. Thank you very much, sir! We all walk along different paths in life. For my boy, there's his way. For you, there's a way that you must pave for yourself. Go now. Yes, sir. Thank you. There she is! Hold her down! Wait! This room belongs to the samurai. We must show respect. -Don't act so carelessly. -Yes, madam. My name is Torizo of the Koshio family. We run the entertainment district from here to Kariya. We're "Bohachimono", merchants specialising in adult entertainments. That girl was the property of our man, Monkumatsu. We'd appreciate it if you'd hand her over to us. I refuse. Honourable samurai... ...we are what the public refer to as "Bohachimono". Do you know what that means? The Bohachimono have lost all traces of eight things, piety, respect, honest, trust, justice, courtesy, uprightness and shame. In other words, we're a group of ruthless outcasts. Win or lose, in the end, opposing us is a fool's game. In any case, you won't be dishonouring yourself in the slightest by handing the girl over to us. Therefore, I ask for your cooperation. After all, she murdered Monkumatsu. I said that I refuse. Because of that memorial tablet you were carrying, this samurai felt compelled to protect you. Now, come with us. Why can't you be more cooperative? If you persist in this folly, the samurai and his child will have to die for you. It is the code of the Bohachimono not to cause any harm to good people. As you've been bought, you're one of us now. Come with us now! If you won't hand her over... -Enough! -You don't seem to understand me. This is what we get for being polite to people. You'd sacrifice both yourself and your child just to save this girl? Why do you insist? We're bound by the evil of a memorial tablet. Because of one such similar tablet, I have lost much of what gave meaning to my life. That is the reason why. -Kill him! -Wait! You are all dear to me, I couldn't let you face such a master swordsman. Honourable samurai... as Bohachimono, we have our pride, too. We can't leave things unsettled like this. Yet I can't sacrifice my men over a mere girl. Let us do this... The girl becomes a woman when she serves her first customer. Her debut, as we like to call it, will bring us a lot of money. So, we can let her go, as soon as she fulfils this obligation. Well? I refuse. If you find that unacceptable, there remains only one way. She must fulfil her obligation by undergoing water torture and beating. Though this might kill her. I'll endure the torture on her behalf. But... It's said that to help a sick colleague a prostitute would take over her responsibilities. There's no rule that a substitute can't volunteer. What if... What if we decide to kill you along the way? What would you do? If that is to be my fate, only time will tell. Life or death, only fate can decide this. Begin! Now, beat him. Honourable sir! Pa. He's not just strong, he's got real spirit. It was us who were scared, not him. He didn't even let out a single groan. I thought real samurai like him were no more... ...but they still exist in this world. Right. We've settled the matter of her becoming a prostitute. But one thing remains, the fact that she killed Monkumatsu. What is it you want? If you do a favour for me, then we'll be even. Ogami-san... While we were torturing you, I suddenly remembered something. That the Shogun's Official Executioner, after confronting the Yagyu Clan, was now roaming the countryside as an assassin called Lone Wolf and Cub. This way. The honourable Itto Ogami is here. Help me up. I am Tatewaki Miura, the former Chief Vassal of the Kakegawa Clan. To tell you the truth, I have been looking for you. I'm sure that you remember. You are the one who cut off his left arm. The Official Executioner of the Shogunate, Itto Ogami. Our Lord Fujishige Miyake suddenly became demented and went on a rampage. Many of my fellow vassals were killed, and therefore the Shogunate ordered him to commit seppuku. No! No! I don't want to die! Lord, please remain silent! Lord! Let me go! That hurts! It hurts! Now! Now! Now! Please, please, just proceed! No! What is your relationship to Lord Miura? I apologise for not mentioning this sooner. I am his daughter. I am Tori, the younger of twins. Twins are undesirable and despised. A certain woman with strong ties to the Koshio family raised me. My sister had served the Lord closely, and because she had learned his secrets, Chamberlain Genba Sawatari raped her to obtain them. Soon after, she committed suicide. What do you want from me? We want you to slay him, Genba Sawatari, presently the Deputy of Totomi. I ask that you tell me your reason. Genba used our clan as a pawn and then destroyed us. He's now the Deputy of Totomi, but he was once our clan's chamberlain. I'm sure that you understand. For his own personal gain, he had the temerity to secretly report our lord's derangement to the Elder Itakura. When our clan fell, the Shogunate took control of our territory, and he was then awarded the post of Deputy. He's worse than a beast! When I think about the 400 samurai now without a master, as the former Chief Vassal, I feel so helpless. I can't die, even if I wanted to. Please. I ask that you carry out our request. I accept, for 500 gold pieces. Totomi Springs: 1 league When Itto Ogami saw the demonic amulets that we'd placed, he made these signs to guide us to the meeting place. Our responsibilities are grave. Do you understand? I am Officer Junai Asada of the Totomi Deputy's Office. I am Itto Ogami. There is a matter which Deputy Genba wishes to discuss with you, and I have been ordered to escort you to the Deputy's office. That is why we're here. The Deputy wants to see me personally? Y es, sir. Please come with us. Will he come? There'll be trouble if he doesn't. If he doesn't, we'll take the matter into our own hands. If you'll permit me to explain, Honourable Elder. If there existed a clan lord unable to govern his people, a lord without a successor, furthermore, one who has murdered many, if this lord were also a madman, how would you, sir, or the Shogunate handle such a case? If I told you that it would be possible for you to destroy such a clan, what would you do, Honourable Elder Itakura Naizen-no-sho? And the clan is...? That I cannot reveal. Just where do you think you are? If it turns out that what you're telling me is a hoax... Sir, I will stake my life on it. What is it that you seek? The post of District Deputy. And to have you, the honourable Elder, put that in writing. You ask for this, but without proof. I shall return with the proof, sir, once I have your written guarantee. Very well. I'll be blunt with you. I want you to kill the Elder Itakura Naizen-no-sho. He'll be in this region any day now. After all, it was l, the new Deputy, who extended an invitation to him. 500 gold pieces in advance. And when you are done, 500 more. It was Itakura who allied himself with the Yagyu Clan to topple you. I am sure you bear a grudge against him. I believe that this is your chance for revenge. Well? I must refuse. Wait! Now that you know our intentions, we cannot let you leave alive. I shall return at a later date. Why didn't you slay him? There were two of you. Why couldn't you kill him? If I'd attacked him, his torso-cutting sword would have pierced right through you, sir. It would have been the same if Kuchiki had fired. Ogami's skills are to be feared. I wonder why he refused, though. He could have refused before being escorted here. Why didn't he refuse until he met me? Maybe the mention of Elder Itakura's name frightened him... Itakura Naizen-no-sho. If it's me that he's after, if it's an assassination plot... He carried a firearm on his person at all times. He even presented me with one for my own protection. I'm afraid this may be the handiwork of Itto Ogami. The Sui-O School horse-slaying technique. So it was Itakura Naizen-no-sho after all. He has hired Ogami to kill me. Samon, can you kill him? Using my lchiden style sword-drawing technique, I'll stake my life on it. Close all the roads and find Itto at any cost! Do not let him escape from our territory. Yes, sir! Junai... Send a messenger at once to Edo, to Lord Retsudo of the Shadow Yagyu clan. For Ogami's head, the Yagyu Clan will pay almost any price. If we deliver it, those shadowy manipulators of the nation will be indebted to us. Then being made a Provincial Officer or Commissioner would be a trifle... ...and the road to power within the Shogunate would be open. For the late Master Ozunu, leader of the Kurokuwa group! Itto Ogami! Kill him! This is the work of Itto Ogami. I am Samon lkiji of the Tamiya lchiden Style. I am Itto Ogami, Sui-O Style. Junai? Request assistance from the Kariya Clan at once. Tell them that we require only their most able warriors. One more thing. Post public notices at all district offices. In order to lure Itto Ogami to Jizogahara. Anyone confident in his swordsmanship? Well? No one? What for? Well, some assassin has entered the territory of an adjacent fief, and he's stalking their Deputy, so we're giving them some support. The pay's good. Well? Speak up! -What is the assassin's name? -That much I don't know. Are you going or not? Very well. I'll go. He doesn't stand a chance. So why does he keep advancing? He's not running away or trying to hide from the muskets and arrows facing him. Daigoro... We are at the crossroads to hell. Archers! Daigoro! Musketeers! Fire! Charge! How remarkable that you have triumphed here. How remarkable that you're still alive, Itto Ogami. However, you and your child will not live to see another sunrise. There is no escape for you from the Yagyu Clansmen! Lord Ogami, you are an assassin, you receive money to kill. I am a hired hand, I receive money for my services. What is the way of the "True Warrior" that you spoke of? And does such a warrior exist? I am prepared to stake my life in search of the answer. Once again, I request a duel. I accept. Let us begin. A moment... There's one thing I must ask you. Speak. This past year, my Lord Munetada had been offered the post of Elder and was on his way to Edo. We were attacked by a mob of ronin. It was a plot by those who opposed my lord's promotion to Elder. We were greatly outnumbered, so in order to mount a defence our best hope lay in a bold attack. I ran forth to slay them. I fought with all my might and drove the enemy back. But the fact that I had advanced to slay them, leaving my lord's side, was judged undutiful and unworthy of a samurai. Before I realised it. I had become a disgrace to my clan. I was dedicated to my lord, I had risked my life to protect him, and he expelled me from the clan. What was the way of the true warrior? To die defending my lord, even when it was clear that it was a hopeless cause? The Way of the Warrior, it is not about how one lives, but how one dies, surely? Lord Ogami, will you tell me? What is the true Way of the Warrior? Lord Ogami... ...what is the true...? The true Way of the Warrior is... to live to die. "To live to die." If I had been in your position... ...I would certainly have attacked. It heartens me to hear those words from you. Lord Ogami... ...would you allow a lowly being such as myself... ...to request that you, once the Official Executioner, act as my second? For those who know the true Way of the Warrior... ...rank does not exist. I shall grant your request. Finally, I can die... ...as a warrior with no regrets! I am ready. No, you mustn't go, my lady! Please don't go! He isn't human! He's a monster! My lady! Crows cried in the night "Someone is going to die" From the netherworlds come the gods of death The Wolf and his Cub The wolves are coming Their footsteps approach The Wolf and Cub are coming They're coming They're coming The End
