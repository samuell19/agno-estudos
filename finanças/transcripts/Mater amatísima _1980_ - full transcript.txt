I had personal thoughts about what the problem was It's rage, fear, helplessness and disgust, all mixed up It had probably gone TOO FAR I was afraid. Very afraid I can't breathe. My fingers are shaking It feels like there are needles piercing my skull I don't like people I don't understand anyone Since that moment I knew he had been born disconnected Thank you He's gone, but it doesn't matter since we're not together anymore and I'll have him alone Don't ask how it happened, it happened and that's that Besides, I'm quite happy - Shit, the toast - Can I help you somehow? In any case, I see you're taking care of yourself and you're in shape I do what I can - Why don't we go out for dinner? - Alright, at ten I'm four years and eleven months old When I was born they knew something was wrong as soon as I crowned Right away they put a plastic tube in my mouth and the doctor said "Anoxia. Bad luck" Then the bubbles began to burst around my nose Since that moment I knew I had been born disconnected Today I went to the park and hit a boy When we got home Mother tried to hide that she was crying and I threw up I don't like people. I don't understand anyone Shit, it's happening again. It hasn't happened for two nights I don't know what it is, it's like a stabbing coming from my stomach I've been feeling it for a long time, rising towards my head and then it feels like I'm breaking from the inside I feel like I'm going to explode It's rage, fear, helplessness and disgust, all mixed up I can understand that you're worried. I've gone over Juan's case history Honestly, I don't know what to say. It's a difficult case to diagnose There are clearly signs of autism which show- - Excuse me, what's autism? - Well, autism is a state of disconnection with the surrounding world whose causes aren't very clear, scientifically speaking In general, autists are patients in a world of their own Their thoughts, loves and hatreds follow their own rules Behind a mask of indifference with the world and people around them they can hide the strongest emotions and act them out unexpectedly Though they may have a clear view of reality, it tends to be distorted and there is a near total blockage in their communication with others Thus their behavior is eccentric, though in most cases they appear normal Sometimes they behave as if they were deaf, not reacting to loud noises, but they can be very sensitive to apparently meaningless stimuli, a soft noise, eye contact, a gesture. - It's complicated - I don't understand Yes, it's. how should I put this, a psychosis that manifests early on and so can be confused with mental retardation but mental deficiencies aren't necessarily the case. Their inner world is very complicated. Autistic children play alone They like things that move, typically. Juan likes fish, doesn't he? Yes, that's true Another surprising thing is that they seem not to fear real dangers, and at the same time interpret love or caring as aggression Their relationships with people and objects are on their terms - Are they all like that? - It varies What do you do when they get upset? That depends. There are techniques, tranquilizers - What sort of techniques? - Like I said, it varies case by case Getting back to Juan. Since he's been with us he's been better, right? Yes, I suppose so You can be assured we're doing everything humanly possible Do you think. that one day he could- No. Honestly, no. I'm sorry to be so frank, but I feel that it's my duty He must always be cared for by someone He's not responsible for his actions nor will he ever be I understand You must accept and overcome it There are excellent professionals perfectly capable of making sure that people like Juan lead a happy life You mean the people in the other building? The inpatients? - You think they're happy there? - Naturally, I'm sure of it You have to trust us Clara Just as you're an expert in certain technology, well, we're specialists in the technology of human matters In any case, my son will live with me I understand your position perfectly Clara. It's only natural but- Look Anna, I appreciate your interest and acknowledge your expertise, but he needs me to be happy It's a lovely day, isn't it? One other thing. he needs caring, but be careful not to go overboard. To put it another way: you must ration your affection, understand? Goodnight, son I don't know, it's some sort of block I start to think of my son and can't go on I don't know, maybe it's fear Gynecologically speaking you're fine, there's no danger of becoming pregnant If you're not done in five minutes I'm taking a taxi You only think about your boats. Come on Luis! Wait a minute! Let me finish this! It'll be perfect Juan? Juan! Come on, we're going to eat cake Here Want some? - Here Ana - No thanks - Do you want some orange squash? - Sure Here are the matches Luisa Ready Juan? Go on, go on Go on Juan, you know how to do it Of course I don't understand You know what, we'll continue this tomorrow Juan! Juan, what are you doing? It's a complete mess. Damn robot! Look at the state you're in! Don't you realize? Don't you realize what would happen? Some day you'll tear the house down I can't have a single moment's peace with you here What's wrong? No answer Well, do something. I don't know what, but something - Like what? - What do you mean, what? No one could take this - I'm going to call- - No telephones How long has it been since we've had a night to ourselves? We're going dancing. We should have fun once in a while Look, I'm really worried. We'd better go home Alright - To you - No, to us - Would you like another drink? - Yes No, I'll get it Hello? We're on our way - What else did she say? - Nothing, that was it - It's really not a big deal - Sure, they're just not used to it I leave him with you one time and this is what happens He broke everything, even your father's boat collection I don't give a damn about his precious fucking collection! And I don't give a damn about him either! He's useless and pathetic, unable to do anything for himself, even fucking taking care of his grandson! - You're not being fair - Have you ever considered what your life would've been like without that idiot at your side? Have you! My problem is you, not him Let's go son - Juan! What's wrong, what happened? - It was him - Who? - Him - Who? - Him! - Who did? - Him! Let's go son Hello? Yes, it's me. Who's calling? What? Of course Carmen, I'm sorry. What time is it? This damned alarm Thanks Carmen, I'll be there in twenty minutes I don't know what to do anymore, he spends the day agitated, breaking things Two orders of chicken and fries, and two cokes - You should take a vacation - And what do I do with him? - You leave him at the center - No, that place is for the mentally ill Clara, I don't mean to offend, but you know Juan is precisely that, a young schizophrenic. And to tell the truth, - you're starting to worry me even more - Why me? I don't know, you're always smoking. I'd say you're entering a neurotic state Alright, clear it up for me. What do normal, neurotic, and psychotic mean? Look, in every case the perception of reality is very different It's possible that at times something like psychotic lucidity could occur, understand? When he does these things he's trying to get affection, to draw your attention You mean he acts with premeditation? He thinks? At times he thinks with a certain lucidity and according to his own logic Another difference between the normal, neurotic and the psychotic is the amount of anguish present and the manner of defending against it In this sense, psychosis is the last defense against intolerable anguish, the only way to continue living What would you do? Electroshock, of course, and inpatient treatment for a time No, not that. Not one or the other Alright, let's eat - Come in - Hello - Take a seat, if you would - Thank you - I'm at your service - Well, let's see I've been going over the matter It's a bit delicate. I feel that we're friends and don't want to hurt you Let me get to the point For some time, we've been noticing major errors in your monthly reports That's a risk we can't have. I hope you understand On the other hand, you're an efficient worker. I believe in you I know you're experiencing hard times and personal matters are affecting your work I suggested something with the administration which was approved To avoid any major problems you will take three months off. Paid, naturally But I don't want to stop working It. it would help me find my equilibrium - I've always believed tha- - It's not about what you believe, it's about risks, risks we can't take Believe me, it's the best solution I can offer I understand Many things have happened since the electroshock sessions I have a hard time remembering everything clearly The room was white. Everything was clean and orderly The doctor barely looked at me. His gestures were calm Of what he told Mother, I only remember random words, "Only solution" , "clean" , "efficient" I also remember the sound of the oxygen tanks and the clear plastic mask While the nurse gave me a mouth guard she smiled, but it looked more like a yawn to me Then she pushed the button marked shock A beam of ice went through my head and my body tensed, then nothing They repeated the operation every other day for a long time, every morning the same until Mother said "Enough" The following months were strange I couldn't stop drooling, and since I could barely move I used a wheelchair Grandmother brought On Sundays, everyone would come for dinner Mother would do what she could, but she'd become nervous every Sunday She'd talk about me a lot, one pointless thing after another until the soccer game would begin and Grandmother would demand silence Then I would hide behind the fish tank It's the best spot, since once you hear the fish breathing you can forget about them and all their shit One day I was so sick I started to feel an absolute certainty in myself It was so hard not to drool that I began to accept the idea of my helplessness AII the electricity they had put in my head had disconnected me permanently and was becoming my friend I felt the electrons smash against the walls of my brain, harder every day, emitting a hum that gave me a sense of happiness I had never felt before It was a sound like the breathing of the fish, but more metallic It was pleasant. I understood they were they only thing I possessed, they belonged only to me, they were locked inside my skull Knowing that was fantastic, it was knowledge that no one could take me back to the world of people That made me feel good, it started giving me strength Suddenly I knew what I had to do, and I had gathered enough energy to try I went to the bathroom and found the bottle of liquid soap I drank it. I liked its strange taste With the second drink I began to feel much better The spasms they started in my stomach were a new sensation, a pleasant one The more I drank, the further I was from people. It was like floating in space For an instant I thought of Mother, she was very beautiful, then I remember nothing. I thought I had disconnected myself forever Much later I learned that wasn't the case. I must have made a mistake In any case, it wasn't useless. Mother changed Since then, she becomes more like me every day She's realized there's nothing to be done Now she lets no one in, and every day she makes sure the doors are locked Her gestures grow more mechanical, and she takes my injections too We eat only when we're hungry, always canned food The last of the vegetables rotted a long time ago. I'm fine with this I like her not having friends and always being with me I also like to watch her sleep She looks like a stuffed doll I had when I was small I loved it very much, but one day I cut it apart with a knife When I saw it was broken I cried. That's the last time I remember crying, and that was a long time ago Shit, again. I can't breathe, my fingers are shaking I have to stop the humming, I feel like a needle is piercing my skull Something is breaking inside. I feel myself urinating. That calms me down The humming finally stops. The smell of urine reaches my nose It's a strong smell that I enjoy I recognize it right away since it's been happening since I was born That smell was my first and only friend I think Mother likes it now too, since she never changes the sheets anymore, not mine or hers. Now she loves only me, that's why she's pushed away the others That's the best thing I've achieved Every time someone came I inevitably felt the needle of ice in my head It was rage, fear, helplessness and disgust, all mixed up I want to be alone with Mother forever, just me and her and the electrons in my head like we are now, surrounded by machines that don't talk or smile, or say pointless things, they only make pleasant sounds The sound I like best now is the fan, it excites me. It's fascinating Soon I'll be thirteen, but I'm sure this time there will be no party or cake, no one to bother us It'll just be her, me and my electrons, and it will be very different Hello? What day is it? No, I don't want to see anyone Clara, you have to open up, it's your mother - Hello mother, what do you want? - Hello, can I come in? I brought you things. A dress for you, let me find it. Also a puzzle for Juan Mother, Juan doesn't do puzzles anymore. And please don't yell, he's sleeping - I'll go see him, he'll like it - No, leave him alone! He had a hard time falling asleep last night. This way - And Dad? - He's well. He sends his love - What are these things for? - What? Oh, the plastic So Juan doesn't get everything dirty. I'm sick of cleaning Sick of cleaning? I can see you've haven't cleaned much recently. You're becoming very messy - Mother, please- - Don't worry, I'll take care of it No thanks, I don't smoke and I wouldn't advise anyone to do so it's been clearly proven to cause cancer So she still refuses to go outside Clear evidence of neurosis, probably a psychotic reaction via hysterical mechanisms - Could you explain? - The events are clear She's identifying with her son without realizing it She ignores the outside world, revolves around her own emotions It's dangerous I don't know what, but we have to do something. Tell me what I can do Firstly, answer madness and passion with coldness Coldness, compassion, intelligence and serenity Forget compassion, I'm not a UNICEF member I warned her when she still had time I prescribed her a tranquilizer, do you know if she takes it? I already told you, the only way in there is by knocking the door down, which I will if things don't get better Psychotics need help to confront reality and to learn the rules of the social game, rules that no matter how clear she is reluctant to follow, she's always tended to solve things her own way Now her behavior is openly asocial, abnormal - What does that have to do with it? - I don't know, but look what happened - I wonder why she didn't marry - That's her business and no one else's But perhaps things would have been different Juan would still be who he is and the same problem would exist That's where it is. He's someone who wants nothing to do with others That's the problem and no one can do a thing - Scientifically- - We've already tried things that way - Look, I don't have much time- - But Clara's your friend! So what do you want me to do, call her? I've already told you, she doesn't want to see or speak to anyone She's stopped answering the phone Look, there's a rule: either the psychiatrist wins or the patient loses That's how it is in every civilized society Yeah, I understand, and this is a civilized society No matter how you feel about it Mom, I've told you not to insist You know perfectly well that he doesn't eat since those damned sessions Come on, you have to eat. Go on, eat please Leave him alone, he can't chew. I'll make him some baby food later He has to eat the salad, that's why I bought it. And you too! You only eat canned food, who taught you to live like that? This place is like a madhouse. The house is full of tissues My god, it's sickening Shit and trash, you're going to end up starving I don't know where you learned these habits You and your brothers were brought up well, you should do the same for Juan How long had it been since you cleaned the kitchen? At least a month I told you he doesn't eat salad, so leave him alone! And that is the last time you ever tell me what to do, understand? Save your advice for your idiot sons and your salad for their stupid kids! And now I'd like you to leave, mother. You've done all you can here I'm going to tell you a story about a man and a star, alright? There was once a strange star, prettier than the rest It was called Mercury. It was never cold because it lived close to the sun But it was very lonely, and it started to do strange things One day, a lost astronaut arrived, tired, his space suit torn, a suit like yours, you know? And he told the star that he was looking for the moon. The star replied that he would never find it, that it was too far and that no matter how far he traveled it would stay as far Understand? But the astronaut convinced her They spent many nights together and became good friends, such good friends that they decided to go look for the moon together Then what? I don't know - You do know - I don't - Have you seen? - Seen what? There in the sky, the moon. It's very big tonight - Do you like it? - Yes, very much Alright, let's go to sleep And we'll go out tomorrow We'll buy a new fish tank, just like the old one, alright? - What are you laughing at? - No, nothing He just reminds me of your friend, though I like him better - What friend? - Yeah, look, they speak the same way He's just like Ana Can you imagine them in bed? Just imagine, her plugging in those cables and the guy saying "I can't, mental block" , her going crazy with the cables and he keeps saying he doesn't feel a thing Hey, speaking of beds. - how would you like to take a nap? - But it's night time Alright, that's enough television for today. Bed time - Good night, son - I want you to stay with me - No, I can't tonight - I don't want to be alone - What, are you getting spoiled? - Yes Come on, bed time Juan, I said bed time Juan, bed time Good night Listen, what if you came to live at my house? - What about Juan? - The three of us We're all friends after all. And on some weekend we could invite Ana and a friend, Frankenstein for example, so she can have fun with that cable thing We could go to the beach, how long has it been since you've gone to the beach? I don't even remember what color the ocean is Well then it's decided, all three of us will go. It'll do us good I love you I think I drank too much, my mouth is dry - I'm getting some water, want anything? - Yeah, another glass of water, or just bring the whole bottle Juan! I'm sorry that this happened, but I warned your friend beforehand Nothing in the world is coincidence For these children what's important, truly important, is a stable rhythm The normality of the day guarantees their psychological stability The landscape must be tranquil, relaxing, no strong emotions, it's necessary to destroy their capacity for emotion - But- - Quiet, I know what you're going to say but we agreed that from now on you would trust me. You've already done enough Today we can practically control their minds Ana, that's robbing a person of life. They can't decide, can't act, can't feel Do you know what you're saying? You're practically turning him into a vegetable Look Clara, I thought you had understood but I see we're still in the same place You have a right to live your life, don't you? I think so In the end you decide, but I don't think you have much of a choice It's bad luck, unfair, a mistake a nature or the punishment of God, I don't care but the facts are these: firstly, Juan exists and he's your son and secondly can you tell me what you've been able to do for him on your own in over 13 years? Can you? - I'll tell you, nothing - I'm afraid Afraid? Afraid of what? - Of yourself? - I don't know. Here, the income form. I've already filled it out, bring it back on Monday Until then change his medication Give him this, here's the prescription Give him one after lunch, and if he's upset, one after dinner They're stronger than the old ones, but don't worry, they'll keep him calm Keep an eye on the them, if he were to take more than ten it would be fatal Clara - Dinner's ready - I'm not hungry You have to eat, you haven't had a bite in two days - Where's Juan? - In your room, watching television - Has David picked up everything? - Only the TVs and his things are left He put them all in your room, there was no way to take them from him Come, let's go I'm tired. I'll take a shower, I'm not sleepy It's very hot Shit, even the cups are nervous today
