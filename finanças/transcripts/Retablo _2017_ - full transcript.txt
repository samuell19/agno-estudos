Say it. From left to right: a woman purple dress, without earrings and with hair - parties to the side. - Right. A girl in pink dress with small flowers. She wears red earrings, big and round. Right. By her side... A girl in a yellow blouse. - And the hair? - Stuck behind. Use... Blue pants. Boys, be quiet. The more they talk, the longer it will take! There is a lady with a baby in her arms, wrapped in a blue blanket. She wears a blue cardigan and one dress flowery yellow. Silence! They will distract the master! Calm down, Genaro. Will be all right. Next to Don Genaro, there is a lady in green, of trousers and green shirt. - And the earrings? - They're pretty big. Really big. - Did I do well, dad? - Was. To be able to play charango, I'll fix your poncho. Ready. Ready. It's getting hard. Put some hot water. A little more. Enough. Your turn. I can do better. Let me see your hands. You will not be born if you are in a hurry. You need to relax or you won't be able to hear them. Try again. Use this. It is not so difficult. You will get it. - Same mother? - Yes. God said He was going to punish them. One of the children she was blind. I couldn't see anything. - Not even a bit? - Not at all. Nothing at all. One of the brothers pulled his hair out. The other brother did the same. And the third stepped on his feet. And that one turned to ice. - It was his punishment, right? - Yes. That's why snow burns the plants. What pulled the hair it became bad winds. It's coming. Climb. - Good Morning. - Good Morning. Thank you. A lizard, shivering with cold, said: "I'm going to make a sweater." "I'm going to make a sweater." He was cold all night. During the day, he lay in the sun and forgot to make the sweater. - He didn't remember. - And when did night come? The lizard said: "I will make my sweater, I will definitely make one." When the sun came up, he forgot again. You can't be like him. If you say you're going to do something, you must go to the end and finish it. Three. Six. Nine. Twelve. A dozen. Of the big ones, half a dozen. There's more, help me. - Were you satisfied? - Yes. Mrs. Jesusa asked for 40. - 40? - The little ones. Tourists buy many. - Is that so? - That's what they say. How many are in the workshop? About 20. - 20? - Yes. Do we need more? More crates for the little ones. Hopefully, we'll find some here. There must be some. There is Felicita. Here it is. Thank you dear. See you tomorrow. Hi darling. - What you want? - A bunch of bananas. Daisy? A sun. Tell your employee to bring me the card, have to share. A sun, dear. Don't play with me. Wait a minute. Don't you want earl fruit? It is delicious. It's sweet. No? - Not today. - Thank you dear. Come on. How are you, master? - How are you, Felicita? - Very well. - Working. - That's great. I thought I wouldnâ€™t come anymore. Hi, Second. - Do you still have any crates left? - Clear. I have many. I almost threw it away because I wasn't coming to get them. Put this together and take it to the workshop. Won't you stay? Yes, I want to arrange the next delivery with Father Samuel. Can I go with you? It would be better to start discoloring the boxes and painting them, okay? Yes father. Second, you look like a donkey carrying these things. Better than being covered in mud with pigs. Shut up. I just want to relax on vacation and see how much they exploit me. Stop being lazy. Work! Shut up! Do you think walking with your father will make you a master like him? You can't even get out of the house. He is locked in the workshop all day. You should try a man's job. What are you talking about? You don't know anything. Shut up, asshole. What is it? What's that, you pig? Is it your pig? Your mouth looks like an ass so closed. What is it? Tell me what it is. - What is? - Give me that. They're from Felicita, aren't they? You bastard, that's why you always go to the market. Want to stay close that pussy and run your hand over that ass. Isn't it? I saw Ricardino the other day. He told me about work in the cotton fields. Said it's not that heavy. You can earn 50 s a week. What do you think? - Is it enough? - It's pretty, idiot. Come on. I already said I'm not going. Two months to go for classes to start. We have a lot of work in the workshop. The pig spat food in my mouth. If we stay away for two months, your father won't say anything. We will. You are very stubborn. It is for your own sake. Idiot. If you don't want to go, damn it, then. Congratulate, I'll grab your ass and eat you! My father is coming. Get the horses and go to Soccos, let's go next. - Yes sir. - Get the horses. - FAST! - Quickly. Over there! You, over there, and you come with me! Remember Hermelinda's cows? The strangers? They were stolen. They are looking for thieves. If they do, they'll beat up. We can also beat them up. What do you think, idiot? We? We fucked them. Just like fucking Felicita. If you make me suffer My soul Will die in the water Won't make me cry Won't make me cry Won't make me suffer, love Won't make me cry Won't make me cry Won't make me suffer, love I was watching me sing with those little eyes, right? Son, sit up straight. Let's eat. What salt is there? Yes, mother, it's here. I didn't do it, just salad. How was work today? I don't think the dough potato cooked well, mom. You'll get the hang of it, son. - With the. - Thank you, Mother. What are you working on now? A three-story rectangle. It will be beautiful. Very good. Son... I don't think I need to buy a shirt this year for you to go to school. The one you have is good, isn't it? Yes, it's serving you well. Your back is growing. Your shirt is almost bursting. I think I'll have to buy another one. Spending doesn't stop. Second, you are growing up fast. Second. Noah. Why are you crying? Don't cry. Let's go to sleep. Yes? We will. Watch out. - is this the house? - Yes. We're here. It's too big. On here. Help me. Release slowly. That. I'm a little dirty. Clean up with that. You are beautiful, father. Hold on. Wait. Don Genaro's family is identical. It takes patience to do this job. Look down there, the inheritance and the pachamanca. And the dolls on top? They are our saints. Beautiful. Simply gorgeous. Look at those colors. Now Don Genaro's family has come alive. Master! Here he is. Health to the master! Come on, master. Make a rectangle for me. I can reproduce your face, for sure! Health. Where are you? Give it back, you shit! Where are you? Where are you? Give it back, you animal! - How are you, master? - Don Timoteo, good morning. We think we won't find him, but we got it. Did he steal Mrs. Hermelinda's cows? Yes. It was hidden in Soccos. It was there that we found him. Antonio, come. Come fast, come on! Share with others. Fortunately, we managed to catch it. - Does anyone know him? - Nobody here knows him. We will leave it there until we learn not to mess with anyone here. If we don't take care of each other, who will? I understand. When traveling from city to city, you have to be careful. You have to be careful. These things did not happen in the past. We heard you're stealing trucks on the roads. And armed. Everything is complicated. Things are getting worse, master. We are thinking about increasing the number of neighbors on the lookout, so that we can have more shifts and more protection. You know, for our own sake. Of course, that's why I give my share. You are not the problem. The second is still a boy. The problem is the other neighbors who don't want to help. We'll talk about it at the next meeting. - Do you still have your whistle? - Have. Let us know if something happens. - See you soon, master. - See you, Don Timoteo. Is he ready? Keep sharing. That. - That one? - Yes, hold on. Think that will Father Samuel like it? Clear. It is beautiful. - See how the flowers looked. - Yeah... Missing a few things. It's ready. How much dust! This one is also coming back from the city. This is going. Stopped. Slowly. - Put it in carefully. - Okay, dad. Good Morning. Second! Second! Wake up. We arrived. Give me the rectangle. Slowly. That. Good morning, dear Noah. - In between. - Good morning, Father Samuel. We are waiting for you. Hi, Second. - Come in. - Thank you. I look forward to seeing your work. Good, Father. The second is growing fast. - Does he help in the workshop? - Yes, it helps me a lot. He did some things in that rectangle. That's great. I hope he becomes a master, just like you. The virgin also waits. The Virgin of the Rosary. We have a wonderful place for your altarpiece. Is where we put our most precious artistic treasures. Come this way. I'm a soldier of Jesus And servant of the Lord I am not afraid to carry Your Cross And suffer for His love After the battle He will crown us God will crown us God will crown us After the battle We will be crowned in the Sacred Si Behold the Lamb of God, that takes away the sin of the world. Happy guests for the Lord's Supper. Lord, I am not worthy for you to enter my home, but say a word and I will be saved. - The Body of Christ. - Amen. - The Body of Christ. - Amen. The Body of Christ. - The Body of Christ. - Amen. - The Body of Christ. - Amen. - The Body of Christ. - Amen. - The Body of Christ. - Amen. - The Body of Christ. - Amen. - The Body of Christ. - Amen. - The Body of Christ. - Amen. They took him away. Nobody wanted to see that. Nobody wanted to. You are so funny! Father Samuel made me laugh. Son. With the. He was very happy, wasn't he, Segundo? He said that in all these years, I had never received a rectangle like that. Father Samuel is here many years ago. It was here in good times and bad times. - Yeah... - He saw almost everything. He knows how to recognize a beautiful rectangle. You are right. Eat, son. I'm not hungry, mom. You must be sick to your stomach. I'm going to boil some coca leaves. You don't have to. I'll be fine. Weird. Yesterday they made us a feast. Maria would you like that I cook to the party. What should I do? Spicy puca or soup? Something very spicy, like last year. Something that burns. With the or you will feel worse. Second. Second. Take it. Take it. For good work that you have done. You're doing well, son. Tomorrow, we will leave early. Pack your things. Noah. Are you sleeping? Why are you sleeping? FAST. Let's have sex. - Now? - Yes. Wait. Come on over. Come over me. Eat me. Second. How are you feeling? Come here. What's it? You don't have a fever. Your father didn't want to wake you up. He went to see Don Marreros. Please take those things to your grandfather. And come back fast. Why doesn't he take it? Because I? Because I'm telling you. FAST! This kid... What's it? Will you ignore me too? I hope Juliana helps me. I have been told how you are going to organize the party. What does the second have? Something is disturbing you. He's asleep. It's me, idiot! You don't know how to play! It hurt my hand! Why did it? Get out of here! You take things very seriously! We will! It will start any minute! C'mon C'mon! Come on, get it! Take it! Stronger, motherfucker! Hit his neck! You son of a bitch! Come on, take it! Take it, bastard! Take it, motherfucker! That! Stronger! We will! Strong! Stronger! We will! Stronger! We will! Very well, bastard! That! Come on, strong! Take it! Pick it! Stronger. Son of a bitch! That! That, stronger! Come on, strong! We will! Take it, come on! Go, motherfucker! Second! Come on! Where were you? Have some soup. Sit here. Mardonio was looking for you. Where were you? Thank you. What happened to you? It was nothing. Let me see. It was nothing! I fell in the coliseum, that's all! Finish eating and go home. Did you hear me? You don't respect me. Come here, you little bug! Here, bastard! FAST, bugger! Pass it on! Gives it back! Quick, you shit! Go screw yourself. - Come on, asshole? - You clown. What you want? Pass the ball, son of a bitch! What's yours, sucker? Get out of here, asshole! Pick it! Finish him. Take it. We will! Mardonio, get him! Come on, dammit! Don't let me catch you. Take it, Mardonio, for God's sake! Don't let it hit you! Don't let it hit you! Don't leave... Shit! Its useless! You don't know how to fight, you fag! I'll find that son of a bitch. I'm going to beat him up. Wait until I find you. Shit! He's going to shit in his pants. I will make it run as fast as you can. Mardonio, we are going to work in the cotton fields. What? Oh really? Look, I'll hit you too. We will. Are you serious? That's what you wanted, isn't it? We will. You bastard. Are you serious? yes, idiot! You should be happy! - Have you talked to your father? - Not yet. He's going to go crazy. Don't worry. I'll fix everything. We will have a lot of sex. What is it, Segundo? What's going on? Nothing. Your father is worried. Why aren't you working? Would you like tell me something? Mardonio wants to go to Ica, work in the cotton fields. He asked me to come along. What about? I want to make money. Money? Your father said he gave you a part of what you received. Aren't you happy working with him? I want to know other things. Don't you want to? And what are you going to do with all pending orders? If you are, who will help you? What is it, Segundo? You will get lost there. Lucio, Angel and Ezequiel went and nothing happened. Why can they and I can't? Because you are an art, not a peasant! That's why your father is training you! You can be a great artist like him. As you always wanted. You should be grateful for that. If you go away, he will think that you are not interested. You know that, don't you? Where were you, Segundo? Were you playing with your friend? Why aren't you working? Tell me what's going on. Nothing. So why aren't you working? He said he wanted to take care of the three new orders. Start working on the boxes. When I get back, I want to see them finished. Where are you going? Tomorrow morning, I have to coordinate a new order. I'll go with you. It is better to finish things in the workshop. I finish tonight and we leave tomorrow. It is better to finish the big boxes. Because? What are you going to do there? What are you talking about? Will you tell me what to do now? What happened to you? What the hell! What happened to you? Do your work! Drink like a man! Now let's get out of that hole. In Ica, we're going to squeeze some ass. Let's get out of here. Say something, idiot. In Ica, the girls they are big and busty. They're pretty big. It will be delicious. Most are of black descent. They're really big. It's gonna be awesome. It would be great if Felicita was here. I would eat it hard. I would take it that way. If you you can't with her, I eat it for you. If you can't, Second, i eat it, over there behind the market. The Second would not be able to handle it. Congratulations. If you die, what will become of me? Where were you? Take this and bring me more water. Your father will die! Virgin Mary, please help me! If he dies, what will become of me? FAST! You are going to ask Don Timoteo for help. Who did this to your father? FAST! Mardonio! Mardonio! Mardonio, come here! Mardonio! Mardonio! Mardonio! Mardonio, open it! Don Timoteo! Don Timoteo! Don Timo... Come back home! Get out of here! They hit my dad. My mom is asking for help. Tell her that we can't help! Please help us, they hit my dad. Yes, we know! It could have been worse. He asked! We do not defend who does disgusting things. Come back home! Go away! You need to stay calm. They hurt you a lot. Where are they? I didn't find anyone, mother. How come you didn't find anyone? I will go there. It was a waste of time to send you. Stay here. You will have Second. - Stay. - Mother, we have to stay with him. No, you stay. And take care of him. We can go tomorrow. No. I'll find out who did this. Those miserable ones! Why tomorrow? How can are there people like that? Liar! Liar. You were with a man! You were with a man! Liar! Why did you do this to me? You are dirty! You dirty animal! You dirty animal! If you do something with my son, I kill you! Liar! I loved you! Skirt! Skirt! I'm disgusted. That miserable... Why did you bring me into the world? For me to suffer like this? Stop crying! Is he still in the room? It is. He doesn't want to get up. Not out of pain, but out of shame. I'm ashamed. It could be worse, Anatolia! That's what they told me. He was having sex with a man. The man's family found out and beat up. They wanted to kill him. He got what he deserved. He was lucky. In times of terrorism, he would already be dead. That disgusting man is not my husband. How am I going to tell my son? How can I tell him what Dad did to me? You don't have to do anything. Let him count! Let's see if he is a man to tell his son. Don't worry. Don't cry. Second! Second, come on! Second! I don't think he wants to go. Second! Second! Son. Come on, son. We have to go. It's getting dark. Don't you want to go to the cotton fields? Cars pass closer to your grandmother's house. Wake up. Can't you see? We'll never be okay here. Why are you doing this to me? Tell me. Why are you doing this to me? What have I done to you? Come on, son. Come on. We will. Come on, Segundo. Tell me. Why don't you want to go with us? Tell me. Why don't you want to go with us? Because I can't leave you alone. And I? And I? I am your mother. Didn't I raise you well? - We have to go. - We will. Come on, Second. He goes. Give him time. Remember when she wore those tight pants? See only. Speaking of the devil... Look who arrived. The fagot. Hi, Second! Little friend, - how are you? - Give it to me here. - His dollhouse. - Beautiful dollhouse. The dollhouse. Stop it. We are not cruel. We will not do the same they did with his father's fag. What are you going to do? What are you going to do? I think he wants a stick. - What does he want? - A stick! Want a dick, like your father? To eat that ass? Do you want? What is it, fagot? Want a stick? In your mouth? In your face? In the mouth? Finish him. Pick it! Let me go, you fagot! Stronger! Fucking fag! Caution! Leave the! Dad. There are still potatoes on the plantation. I can pick them up in the morning. We can eat some and use others for the dough. I think it will for dolls with five or six rectangles. Winter is coming. Maybe we better use them all to eat. This week, we will receive payment from the market. We can make more rectangles to sell. Nobody will want to buy. Because? They know that your work sells fast. We're done here, Second. It is better to go with your mother. Dad. Dad. We can go to another city. We can open another workshop. Dad! Dad! Answer me! Dad! Father, this is our rectangle. I did it for you. The Lord... It will always be in my heart.
