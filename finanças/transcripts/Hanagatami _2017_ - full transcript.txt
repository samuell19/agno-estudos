An Illusion? I pass flowers in bloom. It's as agonizing as it's honorable. Kazuo Dan A Film by Nobuhiko Obayashi HANAGATAMI "HANAGATAMI" is Kazuo Dan's first book. His best friend Osamu Dazai suggested a cover design by Haruo Sato. The publication was announced the day he was drafted as Japan was at war with China. Dan's poet friend, Chuya Nakahara, died of TB that year. Then the filmmaker, Sadao Yamanaka died in Manchuria. They all died at such a young age. Dan wrote, "1937 was truly a bleak year." He was 25. This book is a memento of those young people who struggled to live in wartime. Seen through the wrong end of a telescope an ordinary scene becomes an ancient story. No, it's not nostalgia! It's heartache for all that's lost. Jump, jump. Can I jump? Go on, jump! It's spring but in what year? I'm on Tategami Rock in Karatsu, west of Japan. It could be a fictional town in any time in history. I was 17 and a war was raging. "Welcome home, Private" "Karatsuhama College" The first act begins here. My college is equivalent to a high school. FIRST ACT I'm Toshihiko Sakakiyama, 1st grade! Stomach of toothache? Just checking if I'm poltroon. - Poltroon? - A coward. An archaic word for gutless. Right! Can I jump? What an imaginative excuse. A stomach or toothache? Read the text and translate it. I want to know what you're capable of. Edgar Allan Poe was an American writer in the 1800's. Sir! But we are about to go to war with America! War has no place in my class! Here's a passage from Poe's supernatural and absurd "The Black Cat." "I'll take a pen" "to write a frantic and homely" "story..." "I expect no one to believe" "any of it." A coward lacks integrity. My stomach. I mean my tooth. Sorry to be dull but I'm neither amused or shocked. You find your inverted values and boring stunts novel and strange. I... I can not understand why you waste your intellect! This... surely comes down to my skill as a teacher. You too? It's Kira too. May I ask why? I see no reason to explain. That defies logic. It's man's nature to defy logic. It's a waste spiritually. A courageous man acts quietly. Is that too much? My reason is that I don't want to be a coward, sir. That's not a reason. What it is is just an excuse. "Lenin" Oh, no... I don't even know his name. Mina, it's time for your medicine. Sister... That's my blood.. Oh. You shouldn't have done that... It's better to throw up all the bad blood. If it's difficult, I'll suck it out. I'll suck it all out for you. And Ryo's? Your brother, Ryo went far away from me and died in Manchuria. He hid his sickness and fought for Japan. In Japan today, all men are sent to die in the war. What should women do then? Was that the first time you threw up blood? I called Dr. lchijo. You might need to change medicines. I guess my condition is getting worse. The war is getting worse but I'm okay because I've become immune. My brother... Auntie! It's Toshihiko. Toshihiko. Live here if you're homesick! I climbed Tategami Rock today! I was up in heaven! And while I was there, I grew up! I had a house built for you. A house? It's out the back and it's yours! Want a look? - One day. - Take your shoes off. My own house! More importantly, how's Mina today? One day I'll look after you and your future wife. As I promised your mother in Amsterdam. Oh, my morn? For years you've been your parents' kitten to cuddle. It's my turn to take care of you. That's why I stood by the sea and challenged myself to jump! You better not see Mina today. The left lung's worse. See how the shadow is bigger? The right lung is the same. It was the same with my husband. She only coughed up blood once! Your husband was reckless. He wasted his life. He went to the front so he wouldn't waste his life. "I'll survive in the red, setting sun of Manchuria." Yes, you're right. Doctor. What wouldn't be a wasted life? In Imperial Japan, our lives belong to... Doctor! Have some tea. So... Master Toshihiko, I made it how you like it. Thank you! Doctor. Tea for you? Your family has always served Ceylon tea. Imported goods are scarce these days. You know, the patient shouldn't have come home. I'll refer you to a sanatorium to take her to. How kind of you. But I'm her only family and she hates being alone. So until she marries a nice man... That's good! I missed the tea, and you! Thank you, Doctor. This isn't the time to indulge her. She'll end up like your husband. Ryo had me. Are we going to war with America, Auntie? What about Amsterdam? I want to protect Mina. So she'll be happy. Toshihiko. Hi, Mina! Mina. The sun set and I started to feel lonely. Mina... Sister, I'd like to live. I'll be good if I can stay, Doctor. You're willful, miss. Just like your brother. You two talk it over. And consult me any time. Thank you. Take care of yourself. Goodbye. Stay here. Watch out for the chilly nights. Mina! Why don't you stay here with me? Good idea. Look after her, Toshihiko. Okay, Mina? Thank you so much. Ride safely. You've always prized your English bicycle. Is it still working well? Yes, you, me and the bicycle are okay! But if we go to war with England I won't be riding it. You've had it for so long. Is that right'? I might get called a traitor. Take care of her. Good night. Off I go! You came to tell me that! But they're amazing! Who wouldn't want to tell their aunt about 2 new friends? Yummy soup! I'll have to tell my mom in Amsterdam. It's actually soymilk. Soymilk'? It warms you up inside and out. The doctor recommended it. I bet we'll be getting updates every day from you! I'd like that. What's this? Tofu. It's with barley not rice. Mix it well before you eat it. This is tofu curd. From Akine's? Who? She is Mina's schoolmate. It's tofu galore tonight! How amazing! Karatsu is an old town with many traditional foods. Has it been there since the 1700's? The shop's been there since 1789 or 1801. I'll bring my friends over to try this! - If that's okay? - Certainly. I'd like to meet them. Kira has this mental strength! How can you tell? - He's like a monk! - A monk? A Zen monk. He always sways his head like this. And he wears green! The other one is like a brave lion. He plays flute and smokes! I don't know his name yet. And you? - The flute? - You smoke? What, me? You get taller every day... You have to tell me if you drink or smoke. That's why you grew up! I'm not a delinquent! As night falls, the moon rises. Because the world turns. I guess it's daytime in Amsterdam. Why do we have wars when the world turns? Look. That island seems to be resting on the ocean. It's called Mother's island. Oh, so it's a mother resting! How amazing. Yes, it is. I heard your school bells ring today. It was beautiful and poignant. I was on Tategami Rock. You were? I... I'm courageous. Right. I know! You want to go outside, Mina? Yes. Auntie, we'll go outside. But Mina... Sister, please. I'd like to see it myself. I'll go to the secret hill and see the entire Karatsu sea. Go on then. - Take care. - And you? It looks cold outside. I'll listen to the record. This record is your brother's memento, Mina. Memento? It's in your blood. Come on, Mina. Before the moon escapes. Okay. See you, Sister. I never knew about the secret hill. I guess it's because I was away in Amsterdam. Auntie tells me nothing. I have a lot to learn about Karatsu and my friends. And you, Mina. It was a secret. The hill was my brother and your aunt's secret. It's wonderful under a moonbeam. Maybe the maid knows their secret. Even the path's lit up. The moon is huge tonight. This big? - Like this! - No! See, we're at the top. The ocean! We can see the secret ocean. Why can't I see Mother's island? I can only see the moonlight and you, Toshihiko. The island's on the other side. The ocean's wide, deep and scary... That's why it's a secret place. Let's go further out. We'll go down to the light! We're so close to the edge we could jump into the sea. Right! It's like a half-awake dream! Your mom lives in Amsterdam, what's it like? It's far away in the Netherlands with canals and windmills. And both your parents are there. My father is an Army Major. He's a great and quiet man. Quiet... Courageous men act quietly. And great men like my father start wars, I guess. But my father is a gentle man. And your mother? A coward. A coward? Go on, jump! Jump... Mother used to say that to encourage me. How beautiful... So beautiful! Mina, okay? You mustn't, Toshihiko. Sorry. Good bye. "Taikoso Dormitory" Father. Mother. I'm in my dorm room at Karatsuhama College smoking. This is the real me, Mother. Go on, jump. Coward! Morning! Sakakiyama. Good morning! The clown always starts everything. Aso the class clown, brings people together. Aso is funny. He's nothing. Clowns are tragic without any unique skills. Ukai! A Popper and a puppy, that's Ukai. Kira, how about yourself? I'm a descendent. Of Kira the coward from 47 Ronin. That's funny! Do you think Japan will go to war with Edgar Allan Poe's country? We won't be able to read "The Black Cat." Art should have no borders. But religions fight. What a waste! Of their mind or body'? Maybe both. For Ukai, it's proof. Of his existence. Catch! It's squid. Aso, it's almost summer! I'll burn this trash. As long as it's put to use. It's like an endurance test! Can you look after my pup'? Can I? I kept a monkey, a bear cub and hares for food! Okay, here you go. Hi! Hey, may I hold it? May I? Kira...? It wasn't me. Not me. I didn't do it! I'm sorry, Ukai. I couldn't stop Kira... Take care of it. I can't. You eat your hares! It ate squid. And I'll eat the puppy, when you are hungry you eat anything. You, too. Die before you're killed. Who's going to eat us? Sometimes you need help from others. Kira! What's going to happen from now on...? The flowers have a dim glow Under the obscure moon, your eyebrows are thin On your beautiful face How radiant How strange is the evening Our secret affairs My delicate feelings... I don't want to waste the fire... so I'll boil some water. Listen, Aso. It's yours. - You mean it? - Sure. Go ahead! Ouch, it's too hot! Do it! May I try? It's okay, right? Sure. Go on. Don't, Kira... I'm sorry, Kira. Kira, you too... You smoke. Yes, I, Kira... ...smoke. Your hair's so thick, shiny and black. Hair is "the source of a woman's life." Then I'm losing my life. Only when you comb it. I bet I've changed a lot. I'll show you. You haven't changed a bit. Don't! I'm scared of mirrors. You big baby! Sister... Yes, dear? You and my brother kissed on the secret hill... How dreadful! How dreadful! How dare you knock down the flower basket that was his memento... How about you'? Toshihiko...! That must be him. Oh! Hi, Akine! Chitose! How are you? Can we come in? Go on! You, Chitose and me. We look tiny! We'd just started at the girls mission school. I'm a Buddhist. Photos keep everyone young. Get well so we can go out together. Look at what we did! I'm the model. So cute! It's Chitose. - And Ukai. - Don't! Beautiful. Beautiful. I took that photo but I modeled for Chitose who has a camera. Her cousin gave it to her. The camera takes good photos. No, it's him. No, it's him. No... Come on! She likes the look of your man! Be quiet! He's Ukai. He just started at Karatsuhama College. He lives close to me. He pulls a float in Okunchi festival. He's as brave... Okunchi. As a lion. - Look at you, Akine! - No! He's Chitose's cousin, not my boyfriend. He gave her the camera and lessons. This is her first photograph. His name is Kira. Chitose grew up with him. He was bedbound and reads difficult books. He's smart. Yes, he's like a Zen monk. Like a Zen monk! He wears green. He wears green! Right. Ukai and Kira are my mentors. You're their apprentice? The flowers you gave us are beautiful! Blood! You swung the flowers, Akine! I destroy everything! How will I meet a nice man? Auntie. Yes? Can I visit sometimes? Yes, Mina will be happy. May I ask why? I'd like to photograph Mina. Really? "A good model makes the photo." So says Kira. Right? Yes. How beautiful. I'd love to have my photos taken by Chitose. Kira's apprentice! Kira has this mental strength! No, it's him. Kira is my cousin. I'll introduce you two to Toshihiko. Who? He came back from Amsterdam to go to college. You'll like him. Is he Mina's boyfriend? I can't have boyfriends. Mina. My life will fall like a petal but I'll live on in Chitose's photos. Well... Where's the maid? And her Ceylon tea. The flowers have a dim glow Under the obscure moon, your eyebrows are thin On your beautiful face How radiant How strange is the evening SECOND ACT Hello. "Mizuno" It's a 400-year-old gate. Of an old samurai mansion. How about some tea? Is Kira home, Ma'am'? Come in. He's upstairs down the hall. "The Navy Wants Volunteers" Kira? "The Navy Wants Volunteers" "The Navy Wants Volunteers" Kira? It's me. Who is it? Come in. It's you. Yes, it's me. Come on in. Sit anywhere. You're okay? You're funny. You should ask, "Does it hurt?" I know but...! It's strange... I can move my fingers. My body betrays my mind. Cigarettes! Go on. I know you smoke. You too. I quit. You did? It's worthless. It changes nothing. By the way... I still have your watch, remember? I gave it to you. But... You accepted it, Sakakiyama. I, Kira, smoke. Kira, what's this red fish? It's the Okunchi snapper float. You pull it? No! The real one's huge. Besides I didn't grow up in Karatsu. Kira. You're a Christian! I grew up on Madara island. They say, Madara refers to horses that crossed there. Madara... You get there by taking a boat across Genkai Sea. During winter, the sea is choppy and windy. Amazing! Buddhists and Christians peacefully share the island. Buddhists live at the base of a mountain and Christians on top. There's a small church at the top. I'm from the top half. Oh, really! I thought you were like a monk seeking enlightenment. But you are a martyr! All I did was lie in bed all day. A cousin who was 3 years younger, lived down the mountain. She visited often since she was little. I guess she was escorted by an adult but she came in alone. I was bedbound so she climbed into my bed to play. She got cold easily. You played under the blankets? She played. I was played with. Played with? A secretive game. It stopped as we grew older. Then she got that chair and sat far away. She read books to me in a low voice. She still got cold easily but what could I do? "To avoid a sudden rain shower" "she lifted her petticoat from behind, over her head." It's "Paul and Virginie." It's about a boy and a girl alone on a desert island. It's a European story of secrets. - How does it go? - You don't remember? She read it aloud for me but while she read I'd be in bed, feeling her presence. You see? My Vita Sexualis. She still visits me here. She sits there and reads aloud. I can move now but she sits far away and I lie in bed. Nothing's changed. We struck a balance that way. We're cousins. "She pulled her petticoat up over her head..." She's from down the mountain. It's like a Shakespearean tragedy! It's night. Let's go up the hill. The one with shrine. You're a Christian! I'll pray for Chitose. Hey. Yes? Did you leave Wednesday's class, too'? Yes. I felt pulled by you and Ukai. I saw you. I knew you'd come so I waited in the pines. You ran off so I couldn't talk. I ran after Ukai. I know. I saw you running. Hey, Kira! I watched you too. You also play the flute. Only locals are attached to the flute. But my Virginie admires the man who plays it so. Your Virginie! And the red fish. I'll show you something interesting. Follow me. Take a look. It's Ukai. Ukai? His daily swim. I do this to heal my arm. Ukai swims to heal. Befriend him because everyone looks up to him. He's beautiful because he's alone. He has an aimless vitality. He's wasting himself. Sorry. I always verbalize my thoughts. I waste words. You should go home, Sakakiyama. I'm tired. See you. Stomach or toothache? "Teru Rests Here" Hi, Ukai. Why are you here? I can't sleep so I came here. I saw someone swimming and guessed it was you. Here! I don't smoke. But... I smoked here once. That's all. After a few puffs, I found it silly. It's worthless. Really... Your last cigarette became my first. You were also playing the flute. You should smoke. You have a life. That's Kira's watch. He said he quit smoking too. You and Kira are so similar! Is his arm alright now? Do you skip school because of Kira? Nobody is behind that. What do you think of Kira? Superior to me and inferior to you. I'll fight him. No... Or kill him. If you're free, come to Nagoya Castle at midday in 2 days time. Be there! See you! Rm going. See you! Wait! Want some chicken eggs? They're good. School on Saturday is boring. Everyone's left. Aso, you're always so enthusiastic. - I want to be useful. - Yeah? I want to be like Kinjiro Ninomiya. Aso. You aren't sick, are you? I'm no traitor! Aso, can I have 3 of these eggs? Sure! Nagoya Castle was Shogun Hideyoshi's command post for his Korean invasion. Japan has always gone to war in the interests of expansion. It's Ukai. Hi, Ukai! You're here! - Meet Sakakiyama. - We've meet. - How about you two? - Not yet. This is Akine and Chitose. Kira's not here. He's impossible to drag out of bed. Right? Chitose is Kira's cousin. Sound farfetched? Moreover she's your girlfriend! And Toshihiko is Mina's boyfriend. I'm not such a bad boy! How do you know my first name? Because... I'm a bad girl! Because I mentor Ukai and Kira! They're so different. Come on! Let's drink! Let's drink! - You have glasses? - No. What? Chitose is your girl so she won't mind but I'm not a delinquent. Right? I know! Boiled eggs... I got them from Aso, my classmate. I got one for Ukai, Kira and myself. You and Chitose can share this. One for Akine, one for me. Eat up and use tine shells for cups. No wonder Mina loves you! Good idea! Cheers! Blood. Blood. Beautiful. Mina would be repulsed! No, it's him. You can share mine, Toshihiko. Good idea. Good idea. You can share mine, Toshihiko. We'll be delinquents together. Good idea. Dad! Dad! Let's go. Your mom's waiting. Let's go home! What's wrong, Toshihiko? It's kind of lonely. You are? We all are. That's Madara island. Chitose's hometown. Madara island... It's Kira's hometown, too. It's like a desert island. I'm cold. I have to work at the restaurant. Me too. We'll go home. It was fun. Let's split up. Akine, put the headband on him. The rising sun. What's this for'? A 1000-stitch cloth. Strangely, it makes you feel brave. You deserve someone better. Some delinquents! I ate tofu from your shop. How do you know about our shop? 'Cause I'm bad! And Kira has a red fish from Ukai's hometown festival! Let's invite Kira next time. Okay, Chitose? And you invite Mina. Who's Mina? What's she like? Beautiful. You have Chitose! Come on. See you! It's time for our adventure! Good idea! Next bar! I want more sake, not women! Kids playing grown-ups! This is our adventure! Women? "Private Long Life off to war" Horses go to war! Yes, to be eaten. Let's go in. Boys, we're going to eat you alive! Sake for you. Were you drafted? No, I'm just a kid. I can see that! Isn't it obvious? What are we going to do with these boys? - We just want drinks. - That's silly! Don't you know this is a brothel? You scared them! Go away if you can't make yourself useful like me! Why are you here if you don't do anything? Because this is my castle. Who's the greatest in this town? Us hookers because we live in a castle, kids. Kids! The festival is this town's asset. The merchants and craftsmen used to pull the float. The samurai were the guards. The samurai and townsfolk took turns to care for us Karatsu Lords. Our castle has no suite yet. But the townsfolk will build it. They'll build a grand castle complete with a suite. As soon as the war is over. Listen, boys. Karatsu is a proud town. It won't give in to authorities. The townsfolk only take risks when they pull floats. Oh, what do you know? I gave birth to 6 kids! I feed them and raise them for the country. But one by one they're taken to fight in the war. You get it? All you boys will be taken and killed! Come on. Drink up. Had enough, kid? Not yet, kid! Over here please! One for each of us kids! Sakakiyama. Toshihiko! Let's stay out. Stay out? Okay, let's go! Wait. You made her lonely. You have to do better than that. It's okay. Banzai. Banzai! Let's ride. The horse? Naked. Naked? The horse is naked! Fair enough! Here! Hang on. Private Long Life, go! - Ukai. - Toshihiko! Charge! Go on, kid. Go! Ukai... You called me Toshihiko, didn't you'? Mother, do you understand? How much I love you at this moment. How manly I've become. So manly I could go to war anytime. The flowers have a dim glow Under the obscure moon, your eyebrows are thin On your beautiful face Hello, it's me! Hello. Kira. It's me. Come in. Kira. You're early. I'm here to pick you up. What for? We're having a picnic before the summer break. Everyone's coming. Chitose told me yesterday but I declined. I saw you the other night. With the telescope? - Ukai. - Toshihiko! Charge! That was great. You were drunk? Have some soymilk. Soymilk! It's healthy, right? Chitose got that from Akine's shop. Akine's shop is 130 years old. Are you here because of her? Yes. Everyone wants to see you, Kira. Chitose, too. "I came down the hill one day and saw Virginie" "at the end of the vegetable patch." You grow before my eyes. Soon Ukai and I will be your ghosts. You're brave. Ukai is all vitality. I am hollow. Hey. Guess when I first walked? - When? - 4 years ago. - 4 years! - I've been sick since birth. Mom looked after me. If I laughed so did she. If I cried so did she. So I laughed when it wasn't funny and cried when I wasn't sad. She believed it because to her I was a phantom. What happened to her? She's dead. I gave her a shock... Phantoms shouldn't walk but I did. She was betrayed by her belief. One day she hanged herself. She left Chitose a note telling her to look after me. And Chitose followed me to Karatsu when I left the island. You're Paul and Virginie. "To avoid the sudden rain shower" "she pulled her petticoat up over her head..." I believe in my thoughts not Buddha or Christ. I listen to my thoughts and carry out any order, no matter how immoral. Look. LN' here alone. Activities like picnics have nothing to do with me. You should go. Ukai expects you. Did he say anything about my arm? He said he might kill you. Kill...! I'll fight Kira. Or kill him. That's intriguing. Right... Someone has to deal with his exhaustive energy. Are you coming, Kira? On impulse... Maybe that's how all wars start. He's here! Kira came! Auntie! And Mina, too! Hello. Akine invited us. So we made an impulsive decision to come. Not without a disagreement. I take the credit for getting her here. Hello, Kira. My soymilk must suit you! Chitose will take Mina's photo. Please give her advice as her mentor. I'm an observer. - If that's okay. - Kira! Meet my aunt and Minako. Hello, Kira. I feel like I know you after seeing photos of you. Beautiful. Hello. No, it's him. Thank you for coming. Chitose thought you wouldn't. Who's Mina? What's she like? You have Chitose! There he is! Is that Aso? I asked him to come. - Here are the eggs. - Thank you! We have glasses this time. But Aso... Why did you cut your hair? Because I have to go home. My dad and brother were drafted. I'll help out my family like a good Japanese man. It's not easy to be a man. Professor Yamauchi got a buzz cut! No way! He got his draft card. He did? He's too stubborn... A town official thought it would correct his radical beliefs. Is he a communist? That's how he explored his freedom. His parents' house is near my boarding house. I saw him. He ripped out grass at the back of his place. He ripped it out... Like a madman. Tormented as I am I respect and honour you "Lenin" As the moment of passion passes... As the moment of passion passes... Later on he was playing a harmonica in the sun having his hair clipped. It was done by a local barber. His mother sat behind him in a formal pose reading a scroll. "An illusion... I pass flowers in bloom..." So he's your teacher! You know him? His group was at our restaurant. Off I go. I'll die for the country. You'll become a true man. I'll be a woman. Banzai! Usually they drink, sing and call out banzai but... - Paper please. - Yes. Your teacher's banquet was strange. How strange is the evening Our secret affairs My delicate feelings, hidden in the poem As we look at each other Walking under bountiful flowers How radiant is the night The lives of all the living are felt Tooth of stomachache? "An Illusion? I pass flowers in bloom." In full bloom all around us Tormented as I am I respect and honour you As the moment of passion passes Banzai. After a Banzai they quietly talked. I met him on his way to report to the Army. Sir! He said Have you seen Humanity and Paper Balloons'? Just like that. "It's a good movie." It was directed by a man called Sadao Yamanaka. He died of a sickness in Manchuria, where I'll be sent. He went to the front so he wouldn't waste his life. "I'll survive in the red, setting sun of Manchuria." Yamanaka said, "Sadly, that movie was my last." His swan song. He gave me a book on his way out. I've finished this. So I want you to have it. "Schoolgirl by Osamu Dazai" He was himself again. Well then. I'll be back alive! "An illusion?" "I pass flowers" "in bloom" "It's as agonizing as" "it's honorable." He wanted to say, "It's sad". No more "A stomach or toothache?" In full bloom all around us Tormented as I am I respect and honour you A ragdoll! For luck. Stand there. Okay, Ukai. I'll go now. I have things to do. Thanks for this. Goodbye. See you, Sakakiyama. And Kira. See you, everyone. Thank you, Aso! Goodbye! Did you know that he has asthma? Asthma? I bet Ukai knew. Maybe Ukai was jealous of him. Jealous of him? He is too wholesome. Ukai, Kira. I hope you two become Mina's friends. She won't be around for long. We're delinquents! The blood...! It's okay, I'm used to it. Rest a while. - You're like Virginie. - Virginie? I'm Paul. They're stranded on a desert island. You know what they did when it rained? No. They took cover under Virginie's petticoat. Oh! That's their story. Ukai. Visit us with your friends. You can stay over. We'll have a party. A dance party. I'm cold. Ukai is so nice. Kira is a little odd... They're so mature. You're immature. And Mina? She's both a girl and a woman. I'm asking if she can stay up tonight. She's been unwell. They're here. Good evening. According to Toshihiko, Mina needs cheering up. I'm afraid she can't join us tonight. But dinner's ready. Make yourselves at home. - Toshihiko will be happy. - Where's Kira? Only you can persuade him, right Chitose? I brought tofu! Watch the flowers! Blood. Okay. Thank you. How beautiful! Come in. Ukai is amazing, Auntie! He swims in the sea at night. Kira is impressed too. I bet Ukai could easily jump off Tategami Rock. I climbed it on the first day of school. Go on, jump But it was impossible for me. Tategami Rock? I'm not sure I can... Like you... Ma'am, let's go to the beach some day? I haven't done those things since I lost my husband. But it sounds nice. I'll go and see Mina. How about your food'? Her sickness is contagious. I'm okay. I'll stand back and take her photo. So she can live. Be careful. I'll stay and serve everyone our famous tofu. It's good! I haven't had an evening like this for a while. Next time we'll have a party that goes all night. A formal dance party, with Mina too. What's Kira doing now? Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. How dreadful! How dreadful! Toshihiko. How about a dare? To kiss. Kiss! Yes, but we'll swap partners. I'll kiss Mina and you kiss Chitose. But... Sounds fun! I'll bring Chitose to you then. Mina... Okay? The moonlight is on your face. Ukai, the moonlight is on your face, too. Beautiful. Beautiful. Mina... Okay? You mustn't, Toshihiko. Sorry. This is my only wedding dress. Mina. I'll fill you up with my life. Ukai. I'll suck it all out for you. How come Akine brought me to you and disappeared? I... We'll have to swap partners. Sounds fun! I'll look for her. Now you've gone. And no one's left. Akine. Here you are. Toshihiko, I knew you'd come. I ended up here after chasing fireflies. This is Toshi's house. It's my house! For me to live with my wife. That makes me your wife tonight. Look! Toshi, there's one there! There! There, see? Mother used to chase fireflies like that. She sounds gentle. She was strict sometimes. Coward. Go on. Jump. She urged me to jump on the roof. When we caught fireflies... Here! Look! At bedtime... Toshi, we'll let them free. She let them go. But she'd keep one tiny firefly Here! Here. And keep it in the net. She told me many stories in its dim light. An old man and his wife got mad. They dragged the imp around and hurt him leaving a lot of blood. I love light. I wish I glowed. I'm cold. I'm cold! "I'll survive in the red, setting sun of Manchuria." How dreadful! "HANAGATAMI" How dreadful! How dreadful! The flowers glow dim The flowers have a dim glow The Sun rises high, shining bright THIRD ACT Mama! Mama... Mother! Mother! Mother! Mama... Mina doesn't want to see you. Please leave. Ma'am. Romance would be a lethal dose of medicine for her. - Ma'am, I... - Yes? I'm here to see you. I wonder if you'd swim with me at night. No, Ukai. You must leave. Okay. So long, Ma'am. So long, Ukai. He left. Oh... Why won't you see him? His dream would be shattered if he saw me like this. I'm not protected by the moonlight. You're right. You live in a dream now. It's the parade. Is it a flute? That's Okunchi festival. Let's get you well, Mina. I've always wanted to ask you... What do you think of Toshihiko? As bright as day! Mother's island, me and everyone... Everyone... It's unbelievable! Inhale. Inhale again. Very good. One young man drank a bottle of soy sauce to dodge military service. He was courageous in his own way. It was very different from your husband's courage. He was sick but he signed up to avoid being called a traitor and took his cello. Everyone has their own way to fight. What about me? Get better and you'll be useful to the country. In what way will my life be useful? The Okunchi festival is back again. All the young men were drafted so who will pull the floats? As the motto goes "Give birth, procreate." That's how woman can contribute. By the WHY the Peace Preservation Law was updated. You have young people over to your house, Ma'am... Be careful. It could be misconstrued. Ladies and gentlemen! Look what we made for the festival! Come on in! Hello! Delicious. Go on! Eat and drink as much as you want! I love the Okunchi festival! Every restaurant is full tonight! That's a local grouper! I'll do my best! Me too! All you do, Dad, is drink hard and black out! Pardon me! Off I go. Pull that float hard! That's what you came home for! My superior in the 24th artillery regiment said "if war is worth dying for, so is a festival!" And he gave me leave! Go for it, Brother! Look after the customers. Leave it to me! Here's the tofu curd! That's our town's lion with a pearl! All Karatsu's young men returned home. What a night! This is worth dying for. Banzai! My regular life is like make-believe, Mother. Go on, jump. Coward! Enlightenment, redemption and purification. That's what the festival's about. It's a holy ritual. Holy...? To honour god. Where's your tall friend? Oh, Ukai? He's from Uoya town so I guess he's pulling a float. You know the red snapper? It's supposed to be this huge! I bet Kira's watching too... Maybe I'll go and watch later. Ukai plays that tune with his flute. I grew up by Genkai Sea it was my cradle The storm that blows across Matsuura town That's my lullaby That's how I grew up to be a Karatsu man Sleep tight, kid. The Okunchi song you just heard is like your mother's song. It's a lullaby. I won't be killed! Especially at war! What are you going to do, Officer? He must be about my age. Yesterday mom died back home. All you innocent boys. They take you away and kill you in war. Go on, jump, huh'? I think I'll go home tonight and rest. For enlightenment, redemption and purification... Ma'am! Ma'am! Mina! Mina! Ukai...! Ma'am! Ukai! Ma'am! Ukai... I guess I haven't woken yet... I guess Kira's still at the shrine. Hello'? Kira, it's me. I'm coming in. Sakakiyama, it's you. Come in. So you didn't go to the shrine. Blood. Now you know the truth. It's unnatural and yet very natural. I'm going back now. Don't forget the camera. Right. Also you should keep Ukai's snapper. Why did you come? No reason in particular... Sit down and relax. I think I'll quit smoking from today. Get redemption... and purification. Women are sad creatures. Men are pathetic. Today's Okunchi festival is based on Karatsu's culture. Back in 1593 Lord Hideyoshi built the castle. Grand floats were built to show the townspeople's power to the samurai. The oldest is Katana's, Red lion, then Naka's Blue lion. Zaimoku's Turtle. Gofuku's Samurai helmet. Uoya's Red snapper. Oishi's Phoenix. Shin's Dragon. Hon's Golden lion. Kiwata's Helmet. Hirano also have Samurai helmet. Komeya's Shuten Doji. Kyo's lion with a pearl. Kako's Tiger fish. Lastly Egawa's 7 treasures, all together there are 14. I'm from Katana so I had a humiliating fall from the Red lion. But I still wanted to ride the Red snapper. The Red snapper was my first love. The festival is an embodiment of Karatsu's long and colorful tradition. So those who leave Karatsu return for the festival. You want to ride the Red snapper, kid? Yes! You may die! It's okay! It's so soothing that you'll fall sound asleep. The Okunchi chant is a lullaby for all Karatsu children. Chitose! Why aren't you working at your restaurant? What's with the fish? I'm an adopted orphan after all. This is me. I was going to visit you later. It's Okunchi night. Everyone's favorite time. Visit me? Where am I supposed to go'? Akine, where are you? Here! See you. Look to the east, it's daybreak The Sun rises high, shining bright Our justice resonates in heaven and on earth... Blood. Enlightenment, redemption and purification. This year's Okunchi is ending soon. That's the first time I didn't pull the float. "It's woeful to be impure" So wrote Chuya Nakahara. He didn't go to war but died of TB. Does that make him a traitor? It's bright... Were you looking at my face? I was thinking that I'd die if anything happened to you. Then I'll have to get better. The timing is probably just right. To give her the will to live. It would also be a nice memory. 36.6. I have no fever. Good. So we'll have the party! It would be sad if she died without good memories. Maybe you should rest instead... But I overheard you talking to the doctor... Can we'? Okay. Let's do it. I'll tell Toshihiko. He'll invite everyone as planned. On the night of December 7. Great! I'll think of something to wear. My work is done here. I met you when you began with this family 2 generations ago! Time flies. Right. So long. Ride carefully. Right then! Off I go! If only your legs were a tad longer...! Auntie! I have big news! Japan declared war on America! A battle in Pearl Harbor was won by Japan. It's the talk of the town! I don't know anything that goes on outside. Here's the extra! Keep it down. This is an important night for Mina. Oh, you're right... And how's Mina? Chitose came early to wash her hair and get ready. Come in. I'd better get ready too! Yes, good idea! "Pearl Harbor. Imperial Forces in War with US" Jump. Jump. Coming! You came together! Of course, we're friends. Yes! Welcome. Good evening. No talk about the war tonight. You get to show your skills! It's nice to cook a variety of dishes again! It's like a dream! You're right. In my father's day, we had many foreign traders over for parties! I have a feeling that this... will be my last contribution to the family. Come now. Recently my two sons who I lost in the Russo-Japanese War come looking for me. They call out, "Come on, Mom!" in my dream. Oh... Ms. Keiko, you have blood on your sleeve. That time. Punished! How dreadful! How dreadful! Ms. Keiko! Even though they say the end of the world is near the Sun and Moon will never fall to Earth. How dare you knock down the flower basket that was his memento... It was the time you performed HANAGATAMI. Some time before you married Master Ryo. Punished! Heaven shall strike you and you shall be punished. I remember Ryo being there. He certainly was with me. Right here. With me. You shall lose your mind like I did and people shall call you mad. Don't let them call you that. And watch how you behave. Ms. Keiko! Come on, Auntie! We're sick of waiting! What's wrong? I was just having a dream. Oh, Auntie! Hurry up then! - What would you like? - Vermouth. Me too. Oh, you want one, too'? Vermouth for you. And vermouth for me too. Let's toast with vermouth. I hope Ukai and Kira will always be Toshihiko's friends. Sure. How about Chitose? I'll have peppermint tea like at my first party. Mina. Hello. How nice of you to come. Hi, Kira. - Isn't she pretty? - Minako. I got some good photos. A young military police officer killed himself at Nagoya castle. He pressed his gun to his stomach. Everyone's talking about it. Mother! Kira. Let's not talk about war. Now we have a pretty heroine. Thank you. Everyone, eat as much as you want! "Rhapsody for the Dead" Oh, Mina! Please take care of her. Kira, dance with your apprentice. Kira, I have something I need to ask you. What happened between you and Chitose? The season changed and two childhood friends became adults. I see. Beautiful. You too, your beauty is ethereal. I wore this when I danced with my husband. This uniform is a memento of my brother, the pride of the town. I dressed formally. Splendid. Blood! Oh! Blood. We should dance too. But you... I feel so good tonight. Okay, just a little then. I'm cutting in. Okay but how about etiquette? So a big war has begun? Mina... I heard you yelling in the garden. Oh, no! I wasn't thinking. It's begun. You, Ukai and Kira will go off to fight in the war. Japanese men must be born to die. - "It's a brown war." - Sorry? It's Chuya Nakahara's "Parachute soldiers." He died of the same disease. The brown war...! This country's always had brown wars. - Toshihiko. - Yes, Mina? I'm no longer scared. Because I'll go with everyone. To war'? I know I shouldn't but may I cut in'? Go on. You and I are delinquents but we do nothing. Akine. All I can do is sew 1000-stitch headbands. Ukai is monopolizing your sister. But it'll end tonight. If I'm to die I'm free to take my own life. War is hell but I can't avoid my personal hell. Do we all go to hell? Some will go to heaven, Minako. Look to the east, it's daybreak The Sun rises high, shining bright Our justice resonates in heaven and on earth... I can die for you, Ma'am. Thank you but I only live for Mina as she's Ryo's sister. Her blood must be as red as his. Ma'am. That's why I won't say goodbye. It ends like this. I'm cold. Look, Mina's alone too. Don't forget the camera. Right. A ragdoll! For luck. Beautiful. Mina, okay? You mustn't, Toshihiko. Mina! I'll help. Up to the 3rd floor! She's beautiful. Minako. Did I call her Minako? Yes, you did. Meet my aunt and Minako. Why not Mina? You know I'm the awkward one. I realized something. What is it? I guess you're the only one I've ever truly loved. Have my 1000-stitch band. Maybe you love me because I'm so ordinary. Maybe not? No one marries tall girls like me. It'll make you brave. I'm sleepy. I don't ever want to wake up. Yes, good idea. One day I hope people will stop killing each other. Under the obscure moon, your eyebrows are thin On your beautiful face... - Ukai. - Kira. Let me show you photos of Minako. Chitose took them. I made her take it. Here. She knew'? Of course... not. Come to the sea with me. You're... waiting for something. No. Confess! What are you waiting for? What will happen? I'm not waiting for anything but if I were to.. It wouldn't happen. It's broken. Why, Kira? I have no reason to play it anymore. So long. So long. Ukai. Here you are. - I was looking for you. - I'm going to the rock. - You'll jump? - Yes. I bet Ukai can easily jump off Tategami Rock. I knew you were my hero! And a traitor. I can't shoot a rifle. You're left-handed! My dead brother wouldn't have wanted to see me die. We all want to live our lives. I won't accept that youth is expendable. I knew only you'd survive, Toshihiko. Kira went that way. She was beautiful. She was...? It's all in the past. So long, Toshihiko. So long, Ukai. There you are, it's like hide and seek! Sakakiyama. I've done many things in my life. Some seemed meaningless but they weren't. I humiliated Chitose. I created many worlds that weren't this one. Akine, Minako, Auntie, Ukai and you... I must have humiliated you all. But no one can conclude that I've never loved anyone. I... trust you. After all... I'm sure of one thing. One, believe it or not I can't swim. Two, I'm a sinful Christian. Beautiful... that red dress of yours. Because I've been sucking your blood. I felt like I was one with you and my brother. This is how the world ends. But I'll always be with you, Mina. So long. Ukai! Mina. - What's wrong? - I can't breathe! Help! I have moonlight powder in my hand. Drink it. I can't breathe, help! I'm choking... It was scale powder from a white snake. Sister! How dreadful! How dare you knock down the flower basket that was his memento... Ma'am! Ma'am. I'm in Mina's delusion now. I'm here with her sorrow. How desperate was she to live? Was I truly alive back then? You mustn't. You mustn't, Toshihiko. Ma'am. Mina. Hove you. So long. So long. So long. You mustn't. Toshihiko. An illusion? I pass flowers in bloom Mount Fuji and its towering presence symbolizes purity and perfection. Be the pride of our great Japan! Mother, Japan started another war! We'll die for the country again! Off we go! "There's a window by my bed. It's sunny every day." "Today I heard the wind." "I don't feel so sad anymore." "I don't like the pain but I'm not scared of it." "It's funny to admit but" "sadly I've never seen myself naked." "I don't like being wiped down in bed but it's okay." "I might see myself naked." "I might just see myself naked." Japan lost the war and peace returned. We shouldn't start another war to keep peace. "There's a window by my bed. It's sunny every day." "Today I heard the wind." "I don't feel so sad anymore." "I don't like the pain but I'm not scared of it." "It's funny to admit but" "sadly I've never seen myself naked." "I don't like to be wiped down in bed but it's okay." Mina, okay? "I might see myself naked." "I might just see myself naked." It's been 76 years. Since the war I've lived in the house Mother and Auntie prepared for me. I betrayed their expectations and never married. As my old friend predicted I'm the only one of us who survived. And so all of them, everyone died in the war in my opinion. Come to think of it, Ukai was always a roaming soldier. Kira was a determined AWOL. Chitose was one of many orphans during the war. Aso was an accidental clown. And Akine kept sewing 1000-stitch headbands for soldiers. She survived the war but no one knew where she was. Life in Japan during the war was forgotten along with the war. And Mina symbolized all of our lives. Mina... Okay? You mustn't, Toshihiko. "If I am to be buried, I'd like to be near the sea." "So I can see your powerful strokes as you swim." See, we're at the top. The ocean! We can see the secret ocean. Why can't I see Mother's island? All I can see is the moonlight and you. Let's go further out. We'll go down! "If you kindly visit my grave, do it on a moonlit night." "No need to come often" "but promise you'll come alone." "Mina" "So long" "my dear," "Mina." So long. Why did you go? Mina... "December 7, 1941, age 16" Beautiful... For Toshihiko, his youth was like a game of hide and seek. It was dark before he knew it and everybody had gone home. So long! Jump. Go on, jump. Have I jumped or not? What does it mean for people to jump today? Can you jump? As for me... The breeze of a mourning winter Night after night An excerpt from Kazuo Dan's death poem
