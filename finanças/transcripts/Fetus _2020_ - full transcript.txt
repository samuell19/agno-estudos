What were you doing? Nothing. Sit down. I feel something's moving in my tummy. The baby is getting more active now. I think that's normal. When it's moving alot, it means the baby is healthy. Why now? Well, you're scheduled for doctor's appointment tomorrow. Why don't you ask that to the doctor? Go back to bed. You too, little one. Go to sleep. Come on. Is it your first pregnancy? Yes, Ma'am. I love to see a pregnant young mother. Are you new in this neighborhood? I've never seen you before. Yes, actually just for the past few days. I'm Sukma. I'm Dinar. How old is your pregnancy? Four months. Fragile period. Dinar. Let's go. I have to go./ Sure. You have to be more cautious when a stranger touches your belly. I don't want anything to happen to our baby./ I know. That's normal for a 16-week-old baby to start moving... ...because the heart is already beating. At this stage, the baby has grown into it's human form... ...although not fully developed. And the baby can also react to outside stimulation. Now you can talk to the baby or just play music for the baby. See? I told you. By the way, can we tell the sex of the baby at this stage? I think you're gonna have a tough competition, Ma'am. It's a girl? She's definitely going to be as beautiful as the mother. Last night I felt something moving in my belly. Is that normal? It's normal if you're concerned or have worries because it's your first pregnancy. This is where the father plays the part to comfort and protect you both. Definitely. Thanks, doc./ You're welcome. Alone? Why didn't you tell me? I'll drive you home when you're done. You could be mugged on the street. I can do palm reading, by the way. Give me your hand. I can see your love interest would be someone with dark skin and has afro hair. Really?/ Yes. Get back to work. I know your M.O./ Later. I don't have any M.O. and I think she's the one who's flirting with me. Tell me about your wife's doctor appointment today. Thank God, they're both fine. I know he'll be as good looking as me. I'm happy for you. I'm gonna have a baby girl. Really? That means you're gonna have two women in your life. At home, I mean./ I know. Having a daughter is gonna be a lot harder. You know boys today are all jerks. They'll fool her just for her body. I'm a survivor too, you know. My ex-girlfriend dumped me when she's done with my body. It still hurts, dude. Now, get back to work. Just a minute, Randu. Just a minute! How come blackout suddenly? Dang it! Honey? Randu? Randu? Where is he? Good evening, baby. It's not funny, you know, rang the bell twice and turned off the electricity. I was alone, you scared me to death. I didn't rang twice or turn off the electricity./ I know it when you're lying. What is it? Whose footprints are those? Are you trying to scare me? They're yours. Who else? No, they're not./ They are. See the flour on your sandals? Honey, do you still remember what the doctor told us? What you're experiencing is normal because you're pregnant. Stop worrying and anyway I have a surprise for you. Come with me. Come on. What kind of surprise? When did you find the key? It was never lost in the first place. It was just my excuse. Surprise!/ Wow! Did you decorate this room yourself?/ Yes. Wow! I started this project since I found out that you're pregnant. Honey... Do you like it?/ I love it! I love this stroller./ That was the reason for me to buy it. Incredible. So, have you got a name for our baby? Have I? It's Sydney./ Sydney? Why? We met in Sidney, and I fell in love with you in Sidney... ...which led to my proposal. I see. Sidney, that's a great name./ I know, right? You're so smart! Thanks for everything, hon. Look at the bed./ You're welcome. Dinar. Cleaning the trash so early, aren't you? Pregnant women have such a sweet scent. It attracts spiritual creatures. I suggest you choose your words carefully... ...and mind your manners. Just in case. Excuse me. No!/ It's me. Are you all right? What happened?/ I saw a ghost! Honey, you were just hallucinating. I know there's something wrong with this house. Earlier today I heard someone humming a song in the nursery room. And just now I saw a ghost crouching on the same spot you are. Honey, listen to me. It's just you being pregnant. It makes you more sensitive. I can understand that. I think you should rest now. Do you think I'm lying? You don't believe me, do you?/ Dinar. I just got home from meeting marathons, I'm so tired now. Can we talk about it tomorrow? Please?/ Whatever. Tristan. You sound tired. Are you? I swear, I don't get enough sleep lately. Why?/ It's your sister. She always has a reason to wake me up every night. And she's only 5 months pregnant. It gives me headache./ She's pregnant. She needs more attention from you. I know. So when do you plan to visit us? Your sister desperately needs a friend right now. At least to keep her mind off creepy stuff. Once I've got everything in order at campus, I will visit you. Promise?/ I promise. Looking forward to it./ All right. Bye. Randu? Randu! Randu! You need to come home right now. I just saw the stroller rolling by itself to our bedroom door. I really can't. I still have two meetings later today. I'm not kidding you, it really happened. I'm scared! Stop assuming that we're living in a haunted house. But I'm scared being alone at home. What do you want me to do? I talked to Tristan today. He said he's going to visit us but not today. He said he's still busy with his school. Can you think of something? Hire a nurse or anything to keep me company? All right. I'm gonna try to find a nurse for you. Just try to calm down and relax. Hello, is this the hospice agency number? Good afternoon./ Good afternoon. Are you the nurse my husband's hiring from the agency? I didn't think they'll send us one so quickly. He just called your agency few hours ago. Come in. Let me show you around. This is the living room. This is the dining room. And that is the kitchen. By the way, what's your name?/ Susan. I'm gonna show you your room. You didn't like being alone at home. And you didn't like the nurse came here too early either. Do you want me to quit working to keep you company? That's not what I meant. But there's something strange about her. She's too quiet. She's rarely speaking to me. And she came here so quickly. Where is she now? I think she's already in her room./ What's her name? It's Susan. My belly hurts./ Did something happen? I found some bruises on it. Here, I'll show you. See? Where? I don't see anything. But I saw the bruises this morning. It was probably nothing. Do you think I'm lying? That's not what I meant./ What do you mean then? I'm just tired, I'm sorry. Have you checked the stroller? I did. Nothing's wrong with the stroller and it's still in the same spot where we left it. I need to sleep. Lately Mrs. Dinar feels afraid everytime I leave her alone at home. I hope you understand the situation. Please keep her company and call me if anything happens. Yes, Sir. Nurse, can you get me the apple pie in the kitchen? Nurse? Nurse? Nurse. Nurse. Nurse? Yes, Ma'am? But I saw you enter the kitchen./ How can I help you? Nothing. Here./ What's this? Documents from Mr. Morester. I'm gonna leave them to you. This is so thick! With my salary, around three point something. That means in three days, I'd be dying. Oh, my God. My head's gonna explode. This is too much work./ What's up? This is all your fault. Now I'm buried with work. I wish Susan were here. If she were here, she could cover for me. But now all I got is just headache. Where is she anyway? Any news about her? Since she broke up with you... We didn't break up, we were not even dating. That's an instant karma. Just admit she is your ex. Now your brain's exploded. Nurse. Nurse. Nurse. Nurse? Nurse. Nurse! Nurse, help me! Did you call me? I swear, the door was stuck. I know how you feel. But the nurse could easily open it to help you. Everything was fine, right?/ Yes, Sir. Everything was fine. You may go to your room. Why don't you believe me? I told you the truth. I believe you, it's just... I don't know why I tell you about all of this, you'll never believe me! Dinar... There are some things that doctors don't have the answer. I think you're experiencing one of them right now. Drink your tea. Thank you. Do you think I need to call an Ustad to do some cleansing? But my husband doesn't believe in those stuff. That creature is not only living in your house, my child. What do you mean? Good evening. Good evening, Randu. Are you here to pick up Dinar? I am. Why did you give my name to a stranger? She's not a stranger. She's our neighbor. And I've never mentioned your name to her. Randu! Susan. Are you sure she's not passing out? She has never slept this long before. She always takes a long nap in the afternoon. Are you sure we don't need to take her to the hospital? I am, Sir. All right. Dinar! Nurse! Dinar! Please forgive me... ...for not believing in you. What you've been through, what you've been feeling. I just want to move out from this house as soon as possible. I don't want anything bad happen to us. Especially to the baby. You know that I'm scared, right?/ I understand. I'll take care of everything. And we'll leave this house as soon as possible. I have to go to work. Take care of yourself. You too, little one. Don't forget to eat. I don't do that anymore. Then why did you agree to see me? I still remember the look on your faces when you first entered the door. They screamed trouble. The same look you're giving me now. Now, how may I help you? I just need to know where Susan is. She's gone, forever. Along with the fetus inside her. This is the only thing she left. Her mother picked up her body. Because apparently you already left. Mrs. Sukma! Open the door! Mrs. Sukma! Mrs. Sukma! I know who you are! You can't run away from me! Mrs. Sukma! Mrs. Sukma! Mrs. Sukma. So this is where you work the spells to ruin our lives? This photo was stolen from my office desk. Why do you have this photo? Don't touch anything in this room without my permission. Don't tell me what should or should not do. Because you forced yourself into our lives. What are you trying to do to us with all these rituals? Mind your manner. Stop the bullshit, because you're trying to hurt my wife who I love. You have the nerve to tell me how you love Dinar... ...after you dumped my daughter Susan who at that time was with your baby. You don't know how I felt to have lost my only child. All this time, I've been trying to protect your wife. I don't believe it. You're doing this to us to punish me. For losing Susan. What you've done to my daughter is unforgiven. But I also know that Dinar and her baby are innocent. And they don't deserve to be punished for bad things... ...that you've done in the past. If it's not you, then who? It's Susan's spirit. You made her spirit spiteful and vengeful. I no longer can control her anger. I don't want Susan to channel her anger to Dinar. That's why I've been trying to protect your wife. How old is your pregnancy? Four months./ I suggest you choose your words carefully and mind your manners. Drink your tea. We have to help Dinar and her baby. Please don't hurt me! I'm begging you! Dinar! Dinar! Help!/ Dinar! Randu! Help me, Randu! Dinar!/ Randu! Dinar! Enough, my child. Let her go. Dinar and her baby are innocent. She doesn't know your history with Randu. Susan, let her go! Let her go, my child. Please let her go./ Let her go, my child. Let me go! Randu!/ Let all your hatred go. Go back to where you belong, I'm begging you. My child, if it has to be a life for a life, then take mine. Take it. Take my life. Susan, let her go! Mrs. Sukma! Susan, go back to where you belong! You don't belong here! Please forgive me. I have to go back to work. Take care of the baby. Don't you think you owe me an explanation? About what? Mrs. Sukma said to the creature that she needed to forgive for what you've done in the past. What was she talking about? This is not the right time. Somebody died in our house and we're on the police watchlist. But you still want to keep me in the dark? Few months before our wedding... ...our office hired a new employee. She was Rio's co-worker. She flirted with me and I foolishly let her. What are you doing here? I'm 6 weeks late. This is your child. Don't run away from your responsibility. We're not dating. We know nothing about each other. But then again... ...it probably isn't mine anyway. How dare you! I can do a test to prove it to you. We can do it now./ It doesn't matter. I will never marry you no matter what. How could you! I'm marrying Dinar in two months. I won't let you destroy my plan. Is she pregnant too?/ No. Then why choose her over me?/ Because I love her. And you don't want to marry me? You don't want to marry me? You don't want to marry me? You really don't want to marry me? You have to marry me, you have to!/ Stop it. No, you have to marry me!/ Stop. No.../ Stop. You have to... I will destroy your marriage if you refuse to take the responsibility for my baby. You have to take the responsibility, you have to! You have to take the responsibility./ Everything has a solution. You have to take the responsibility. I would never sacrifice our marriage. Until she finally did the abortion. Did she initiate the abortion or did you make her do it? What is this place, babe? This is the place where we can solve our problem. What do you mean? Just a regular check up for your pregnancy. But why this place? Why can't we do it in a hospital? Who are they, babe?/ Are you ready? Ready for what? Well, Sir? Yes, she is. Abortion? I don't want to do an abortion, Randu! Randu! No! I hate you, Randu! Please forgive me, honey. Honey. I never thought that I am married to an asshole! Dinar... We had a fling, she got pregnant. She wanted me to marry her. I refused! I would never sacrifice our marriage. Until she got an abortion. Hello./ Good evening, is this Mr. Randu? Yes, I am. Who's calling? We're calling from the hospice agency. Sorry for keeping you waiting. But we finally have a nurse available for you. When can we send her to your house? Hold on. I thought you've sent us one 2 months ago. I'm sorry, Sir. But we haven't sent anybody because we didn't have any available at that time. Give me your baby! The amulet. Give me your baby! Nurse? Nurse. Nurse! Pick up, Dinar! Nurse. Nurse! Somebody help! Help! Help! What did I do? Why me? Sis? Why is it so dark in here? Dinar? Sis? Where is she? Sis? Sis? Dinar? Sis? Sis? Dinar? Sis? Please don't! Don't! Sis? Sis!/ Tristan! Tristan, please help me! Sis! Sis, hang in there! Nurse... Nurse! My sister is locked in that room. Please find me anything to open the door. Nurse, please!/ Tristan! Tristan!/ Sis. That nurse is not a human, she's a demon! Go get me the ruby amulet from my room. Tristan!/ Okay, Sis! Tristan! Help me, Tristan! Help! Let me go! Please don't hurt me! Let me go! Let me go.../ Give me your baby! Give me your baby! My baby is innocent, Susan. Please let me go. Susan! Dinar! Dinar! Go back to where you belong! Hang in there, Sis. Tristan... Wait, nurse. Please look after Sidney. I will. You should wait here. Why is it turned off? Sidney. Dinar... So where's daddy? He's gone away too long. I miss him. Sidney. Who are you talking to? That nurse. Come here. Sidney, I've told you, do not enter this room. Don't wander off from me. Okay.
