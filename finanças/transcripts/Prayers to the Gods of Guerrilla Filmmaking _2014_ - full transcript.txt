- Hey, I'm just taking pictures, man. Back off. - Back off bitch. - It doesn't look like a video camera. It looks like a photo camera. - It is a photo camera actually. - It is a photo camera actually. So I know my rights. But this is not China, this is Hong Kong. It is a whole different place. - There was this guy looking for a lead actor for a feature film to be shot overseas. Guess I must have gotten in touch with Marco and we met a few times over that summer and I was definitely a little hesitant at first. I mean, you know, you gotta be careful with that stuff though. But when I met Marco, you know, I could tell he was somebody genuine and it's exciting when people are passionate about something and people are willing to invest a lot of themselves and a lot of the resources like he has. - The thought of a guy independently producing a film and willing to pay for people to fly, like, the airfare cost him a lot of money. It cost him probably, 10, 15 grand. Just on airfare, to have people here. $15,000 you could put a down payment on a house. You know, so to spend $15,000 just to get people here. It's a bold move. So I respect that. - Marco contacted me like a year ago. He told me that he had this story in his mind that he wanted three to develop it and that he wanted me to be part of the crew and I was like yeah yeah, whatever. I didn't believe him at the beginning, and six months after he was like okay I'm starting the script, I'm writing it and everything and I was like yeah yeah, whatever. It was like a month before buying the tickets that he was like okay I will start looking at tickets and everything. I was like whoa, maybe he's serious you know? (calm echoey music) - Okay so basically the plan, we go to Hong Kong, we stay there for seven days, we take three actors. One guy's gonna take care of the audio. One guy's gonna take care of the photography We just shoot on the streets, maybe bars, restaurants. All guerrilla style, no permits. We don't have a producer. We don't have any investors. So I'm actually producing this movie myself. There's no real money. Nobody's gonna get paid. I'm just gonna pay for the trip and for the accommodation. Well we have to write a script and we have to gather enough people. But I don't trust some people. I just don't want anyone to bail out at the last minute or think that we're going to Hong Kong just to have fun and have a holiday. We're gonna go there to shoot. It's not gonna be easy. It's probably gonna be a pain in the ass. So I'm gonna make sure that everybody knows. This is not gonna be fun. The only problem is that yeah, I'm a bit nervous that people might bitch about all the problems we're gonna have to endure, but apart from that nothing can go wrong. So this is what we used at the pharmacist to explain we needed a shot. - [Voiceover] What happened exactly? - The worst cat in the world bitten me. He brings every disage... - [Voiceover] Disease. - Disease, disease in the world. Maybe also AIDS. - [Marco] Show me your hand. (laughing) Alright cool. We had an unfortunate accident today, when one random moron, which I won't mention but it was one of the actors got bit by a rabid cat and now he has rabies. (laughing) - If I must die, I hope to die after the movie's, so that the movie could be in my memory. Memory of Furio Mazzarelli. With love... - That's your last name, Mazzarelli? - Mazzarelli. - That is a beautiful name. - [Both] Furio Mazzarelli. - [Furio] Staring Furio Mazzarelli, dead. - If you see foam from his mouth... Alert the authorities. Yeah but don't touch him because he has rabies. - Oh shit! (screaming and laughing) - [Andrew] Well we arrived, so let's have a round of applause for that. - We arrived so oh, they say, 80% is showing up. - There we go. - Well done, you need 20% now. - Yeah. - So first thing, we're gonna have a plan every day. All good with that? You all know your lines right? - Okay but to be fair, I know them reading the script like in the sense of like, it's gonna take a couple times. Like we're gonna have to rehearse before. - [Marco] We are going to have to rehearse before because the scenes are very complicated. - I met quite a few actors. Most of the time I just met them in a cafe and I just told them, look this is what we are going to do, it's gonna be hard, it's gonna be... I don't want any troublemakers I don't want people to complain, because that's what I was trying to filter. That was my main concern. I knew that we needed people to be committed and i told them, you know, we were gonna stay in a very bad place, that were going to be working almost 24 hours, no rest and then obviously most of them were like yeah okay, yeah sure because I mean, they wanted the gig, but that is not a process that I liked because you just have to meet a lot of people that are full of shit. They just want to work on something and also people, they think that just because they look hot they're actors. So that wasn't a fun thing to do. I mean Mathieu, I just saw him when he sent me his picture and I just thought like wow, this looks like exactly the guy I have in mind for Eli, and if he's a decent actor, I'm just set on him because he just looks like you know, just visually because that's all I had, and the other guy, I didn't like him personally. I thought he was obnoxious and annoying, but that somehow he might have fitted with the character. That was the most important thing. I put two or three scenes per day, which if it works out, it's very optimistic but if it works out, it means that by January 6th we're finished. - [Andrew] I'll work so hard if we could do that. - My schedule is very tight, it's very optimistic. - [Andrew] Let's do that. - But if it works out, on the 6th we're all finished. After that, we do ADR. After ADR, you can go nuts. You can go to the beautiful girls (all laughing) to the mansion. - [Alejandro] To the funny timing. - Yeah you can have funny timing with them. - My name's Andrew Mazzolin. I'm from, my father's from Friuli Italy. My mother's from Treviso Italy. Came over on the boat when they were like three and four years old. I never really wanted to be an actor. I liked entertaining. I liked playing guitar and telling jokes and shit like that. Acting was something that kind of came as a by product of that. Well I mean, a lot of people are doing shitty community theater, or fucking doing shitty ass student plays in Toronto or whereever the fuck, and to do a movie in Hong Kong, it's a bit of a fish out of water thing and it's definitely a unique experience and I can't knock that. - [Marco] Which is one of the main landmarks of underground Hong Kong. It's a big high rise building full of cheap restaurants, hostels, all kinds of dodgy businesses going on. It's like it has a life of its own and it also happened to be the location of one of my favorite films, which is Chungking Express. It's a Hong Kong film from 1994, Directed by Wong Kar-wai. I watched it in the time of my life when I kind of almost gave up on the idea of ever making films. I mean, I could tell that it had a very very low budget and it was shot in a rough way, but somehow it's still really stylish, it still looked professional. You know, it had one of the best photographies I've ever seen in a film, and I thought well, maybe there's a chance that at some point I'll get enough money to make something good. (speaking foreign language) Because every two seconds people would just go like no, no, no, stop stop stop stop stop. Hey, can someone give me a hand. - What are you doing man? - It was broken already. I just tried to close it. - [Alejandro] You tried to open it from the other side? - Well I tried, and then it wasn't moving. I didn't want to make a mess, so I just gracefully-- - [Alejandro] So you made a mess. I gracefully moved it, and then it just broke. Chungking mansion after all. It has to be expected. - Where anything can happen. - Yeah man it's such a pain now. I mean you can't even sit. (laughing) I mean, there's no space. Would it have killed them to have like, one more meter squared and then they're gonna move you to 97 which is gonna have three beds but no ceiling. (laughing) - The ceiling's gonna be the toilet of the guy on top-- - It's always a trade off. You gain something you lose something. (laughing) - The script will start with all the three characters Eli, Patrick, and me myself Armani. I'm really ashamed for my way to talk in english. I'm very embarrassed. So I try to make little jokes, some silly things but I'm really ashamed. - [Andrew] You should, I don't know man. - So you're saying Marco is just like Francis Ford Coppola huh? I agree. - Oh I did not say that, but absolutely maestro. You're absolutely Francis Ford Coppola. - [Marco] Oh, long story. (laughing) - [Andrew] It is a prostitute. I met the prostitute. - [Andrew] The release form. - Yes sign by tomorrow with your blood. - [Andrew] And my pound of flesh. - Whoa, it is a mattress. - Oh yeah, it's a mattress. - Not what I thought. - But now it's actually better because we put it in the middle so it's not just... - [Alejandro] Anyway guys, we have to wake up very in a few hours. Just please go to sleep. (tranquil music) Like most kids I was into the usual Hollywood fayre, films like Back to the Future, and Ghostbusters, Robocop, that kind of stuff, but then as I grew up I got more interested in slightly more serious and artsy films. I dreamed I was going to be a film maker just like you would dream that you would be a football player, but I never actually seriously thought that I was gonna make films. At first my friends thought I was making films just kind of like as a hobby. Now when they realize that the stakes are much higher. That I was going to Hong Kong and putting all this money and buying equipment. Then they started to think that there maybe was something wrong with me because I was either deluded, thinking that I was gonna make all the money out of it, or I was just having a middle aged crisis. I think every artist, when they create they create out of a need to express themselves to just get something out of their brain and into the real world. Well it's not a hobby because it's not even something that gives me pleasure as I do it. It's more like a grief. It doesn't sound nice maybe, but film is like a cancer and I have to get rid of it and the only way to get rid of it is just to put it on a screen and once it's on a screen I just feel the relief. If I don't finish this film, that's it. There's no producer who's gonna put more money or even fire me and hire somebody else to finish this. If I don't tell this story, if I don't make this film, it's just gonna disappear. So it is a lot of pressure I think. If you fuck up, that's it and in the end nobody's even gonna care if you do it or not. - In North America they don't do this. I'm bound by these laws that say I can only eat this until 10:30 in the morning. Thank you McDonald's, thank you. - He's loving it. - He's loving it. - Well I'm Matt, Mathieu, whatever you want to call me. I'm kinda from all over Canada. I lived in Toronto this summer which is where I met our friend Marco. After many months we're finally here and I guess I'm here because, I think in our field any actor would be crazy not to do this if they were given this opportunity. Like when you're starting out, it's hard to get a lead role in a film project anyway and not a lot of low budget projects are feature films. So they're usually shorts, so it's a rare opportunity to get offered a role in a feature like this and be able to work on a full character. Sleep? What sleep? (laughing) We didn't sleep much. Furio and Andrew and I and Francisco a bit, stayed up talking for most of the night because we couldn't sleep, and we're just getting to know each other so that was good too, you know? We're all like two feet away from each other in that room so and it's such an interesting crew. Like you have people from Europe, people from South America, people from Canada, and man Furio is hilarious. Such a loud voice, such a deep, vibrating voice and then Andrew never stops talking. - Today we were supposed to be back at fucking 10:30 not 12:00. He laughs, he talks a lot but, he's not to be trusted. He thinks that this is a high school trip and I base this on on previous experience with rehearsal and stuff. It was 10:30, he tried to make it, you know as if it was 12:00, but it wasn't. - This is the mattress that we're gonna be sleeping on. Like one... this one person, this one person. - I'm signing my life away. - [Marco] This you're saying you're not gonna sue me. You're gonna have a happy face for the whole shooting, and when I say 10:30, you're gonna be here 10:30. - [Andrew] And if you said it in English I would have been here at 10:30. - Alle mezzo, when I read my book called Pimsleur learn and speak conversational Italian, they say alle mezzo is 12 o'clock noon. - [Marco] Okay well what book was that? - Pimsleur Italian, and that's what I understood, and I don't want to talk about it anymore. - I guess for me that I would prefer that you write to me in Italian. - Yes. - [Marco] I could translate but, - words are nothing. - I went to high school with Furio but I haven't spoken to him in more than 10 years, but randomly he got in touch, and he casually mentioned that he was starting to be an actor. I already cast somebody as in the role of Armani, but this person bailed out last minute and because I didn't have time to do casting again, I asked him if he was interested and so that's how he got him. - [Andrew] It's still a beautiful language. - [Alejandro] Everybody sign the thing, just sign the thing. I mean, nobody's gonna abuse anything. - So if Spielberg comes and gives you this, you're just gonne be bitching about it, yes? - Yes, Spielberg pay to me a perfect of course of English if needed. - [Marco] Yes. What time is it? 12:30 okay, we have time to cut your hair. Finally, you puts hallelujah here in the soundtrack. (laughing) Next time bring your lawyer. - Usually I bring long hairs, not like this and then I now, I have to cut anymore. - Yes. - Fuck. - We cut anymore. (talking over each other) - I don't know English, I'm stupid, fuck off. - Not at zero totally, no. - I said 12. - [Andrew] I don't know how anyone sleeps on this mattress. - Whoa, whoa. - Eli, I don't know how you did it up here man. - Oh well, I've slept on worse. - [Andrew] Really? I think the ground would be more comfortable. - [Marco] (speaking foreign language) - Probably. - So I had a delicious breakfast this morning, of a sausage and egg Mcmuffin with twisted noodles. It was wonderful, in a broth. - [Marco] We bring this one, this one, and that one. - Why did you bring these bags? - Did I bring the right one? - We should bring that here. - [Alejandro] Bye bye. - And now we play the waiting game. - Yeah. - We should pretend we don't speak English. - Yeah. - Just speak a random language or Spanish. (speaking Spanish) - Who is it? - I'm sorry, we're gonna make up the room. - Oh no, it's okay, it's okay. - [Hotel Employee] Okay. - It's alright, don't worry. - [Hotel Employee] Thank you. - Bye bye. - Oh shit, man. - Right? (laughing) - Have some music in the background. - Yeah, turn the TV on. - I get to live in the Ritz for a few hours. - My first scene, absolutely my first scene. - [Alejandro] Virgin. - I'm virgin, I'm virgin. Totally virgin. But is a virginity that I want to lose. - [Alejandro] Well, is there a virginity you do not want to lose? - I'm excited, I am excited. (laughing) I'm hard. - [Alejandro] Okay. (laughing) - [Marco] Okay, start recording. Alright, roll camera. Are you rolling sound? - Rolling. - [Marco] Okay. - Wait, I don't like this. This is wrong, there's nothing on the screen. - Yes it's rolling, your on okay. Alright, roll one scene three take one. (clip board snapping) Action. - He said he would be here for the celebrations. He said for the celebrations, he would be here. - [Marco] Okay cut. It didn't work out? - Yeah, I came from the top and I realized the boom was there. So I don't think we saw it but I was just scared. - Sorry man. - It's okay. - We'll go with another one. (tranquil music) Because it was the first day, I wanted to try tracking shots and crane movement and I did more takes, more takes. I was being more of a perfectionist and it didn't work out because it took a long time and the light changed completely and now I have a lot of issues with editing because I have to make it match, but because of our production schedule, we're very limited. We can't spend too much time on a scene. So I felt like we might not even make it. I mean, if we go like this way. So I was very disappointed. I tried to keep it to myself but I was kind of worried. - Well the problem is that we didn't do what we had planned for today. - Yeah, we didn't even finish this. - Yeah, that's fucked up. - [Marco] Action. - So, go to the bathroom and take a shower I guess. - [Marco] That's what we all decide here? - It was very good, but it was slow. I mean, a whole day for a scene. - The whole movie? - Yeah. (laughing) - You don't have to apologize to us. You're doing a wonderful job. Take care. How's your day going? (laughing) - The leaning tower of Pisa. It leans to the right or to the left? - It went to the right. Because I use my left hand with hand job. (laughing) - It's a real vibrant city. - Bustling with life. - Bustling with life. - People making out in the kitchen. - Yeah all that shit. - So these are very complicated crane shots, which requires a lot of time for a very short scene but if it works out it's gonna be pretty awesome. - I don't know if he's wearing that scarf because he's sick or because he thinks it fucking makes him look smart. It's in the fucking film making for dummies. All directors gotta fucking have a receding hairline and wear a scarf. Ah come on, shut up. (laughing) - Like a gangster. - [Mathieu] You look good man. You look good down there. - Oh shit, oh shit. Here. (inspiring music) - One of the main things that he's trying to do that we're trying to do is just put together a good project, a good film with a very small budget and show that it's possible to put together something good, something of quality with limited resources. - I have always believed that generally in art if you want to connect a lot with the art work you're doing, it doesn't matter how much you've got. I mean you can see these huge productions that they say nothing, you know, and on the other hand you can as well see the contrary. Like small productions that are very very touching you know? - I like what Marco is doing. I like the intention he has in coming here. Everybody is here to gain good experience and to help themselves and I think that's important because we're all hungry for something. We all believe in the same thing. - Everyone's involved in this production for selfish reasons and for non-selfish reasons. Every actor on this is in this because they couldn't get another gig and this is a pretty cool gig to be in for people that can't really get gigs with the big boys. Well it's... (laughing) it's a small budget movie really trying hard to be a big budget film. Unfortunately money and time is something that you need to make a really beautiful film. If you want to have a crane shot, then you want to have a steadycam shot, then you want to have, you know, a two shot and then a three shot you know? That takes a long time and have the lighting and everything and you know, we don't really have that time because the money is not flowing on this film. - Deep? No no no no no. - A lot of... - Alright there you have it. - I have very a lot more enemies than friends. - Make? - A voodoo doll. - [Furio] A voodoo? - Yeah yeah. - Against me, it's probably... Because surly there are a lot of people that envy me for being here. So it's probably... Because they are not good actors. - I think I'm a wonderful human being, however I'm also very blunt. So if any of you piss me off I'm gonna be very clear. I'm not gonna be offended. I'm not gonna expect any of you to be offended either. So if I tell you you're shit, it's probably because you were shit in that particular scene. It doesn't mean you're a shit human being. I'm sure you're a wonderful man and you'll make a wonderful father one day, however if you're doing shit on a scene then you're gonna be told you're shit in one scene. If you're really really tired don't just you know, act tired or act annoyed. No we're not kids here. Let's not you know... Let's just be very very clear about everything straight away. You know, if I say something you do not like then tell me straight away. If I'm directing you badly, tell and let me know. If you know there's something on the script you think is stupid, let's just you know, clear it straight away. Let's not create this stupid drama which is not useful. - [Mathieu] I actually slept better tonight than last night. - I feel sick so I kept waking up. - I don't know exactly how to get there. We're going to a bar but I'm a bit worried because my contact is not there. He's in China now. - [Furio] One night and one night. - You pitch or catch. - Ready ready. - Shall we? - Oh shut up. - [Andrew] I don't want to hear that shit. - Let's go. (police siren ringing) - Don't I look handsome? I do. You love me. You love everything about me, you love the way I talk, the way I sing, the way I look. You love the way my ass fucking shakes in these jeans. You love the way I speak. My fucking eloquence. - Oh there's a Burger King. - So I just woke them up. So they're not in the best of moods probably and they don't seem to be enthusiastic about the idea of shooting. - It is just a job though. I report infringements. - Step by step. You must be proud of yourself. Do it in a kind of, you must be proud of yourself. Like really this kind of loathing at it. - Alright. You must be really proud of yourself. - Okay that's it. I like it like that. - Oh my god okay. (laughing) - Yeah yeah I mean, you can blame my-- - I'm not blaming anything. I'm just surprised is all. - Well again, because again, you know maybe we didn't get on the same page on the role, but I want it to be kind of over the top, and then when there's certain scenes where you're being a bit serious and it's actually-- - okay okay okay. No problem no problem. - Okay, so just you know, have fun with it. - You know when you read something and you think of it a certain way, right? - Yes. - And then, I'm not saying you're wrong or I'm right. I'm just saying like, it's just surprising is all. - Okay well I mean, when we last time we talked about-- - Seeing Armani for the first time here was surprising and it's wonderful and this part's wonderful. Everything's wonderful. - [Furio] Am I a perfect Armani? - You're perfect. - This look is really really really different from the look I usually got. - Yeah you're a very handsome man usually and you dress well. - I really am. - [Andrew] You don't like like Kappa? (speaking foreign language) - Kappa, it sucks. (laughing) I'm a real fashionistic guy and this is an insult. - So how outlandish do you want me to be here? Do you want me to like, be like yes! - Oh no there is the fucking microphone. - Sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry. I won't do that. - And it's also not our place so, let's not smash this. - How long is this scene? - Very long. - Yeah. - This scene is long yes. So let's try to be just right, perfect. - I'm Patrick and I'm doing G-R-E-A-T, great. Tony the tiger. - When you say, let's see, where do I start? Where do I start, you take your phone and you start playing with it. Okay, and then after that you do the whole scene with the phone. - [Andrew] Where are we starting from? - [Mathieu] At Jesus. - I start yeah, yeah at Jesus. Jesus and I begin. - [Francisco] Okay. Camera rolling, calling. - [Marco] Roll one scene eight H, take one. - [Francisco] Mark it. - [Marco] Action. - [Mathieu] Jesus. - It is just a job. I report infringements. - [Mathieu] And it's not like you're drowning kittens in a lake, probably just pissing off a geek or two. - [Mathieu] What do you do? - [Alejandro] Should we cut? - I've not taken the phone-- - [Alejandro] No let's keep this going. - Complaining time over. We're gonna have him saying, we're not comparing you to Mickey Mouse. When he says Mickey M... You get up, and you go like I'm not the fucking rat. I am not a rat. - [Andrew] And for the record, no, I'm not comparing you to Mickey... - I'm not a fucking... - [Andrew] Okay I'm gonna say the whole... Don't cut, go, go go go. - Alright let's just do it again from start then. - [Andrew] And for the record, no I'm not comparing you to Mickey... - I'm not... - Armani's a bit disappointing but, I guess he's not as good as he thought he was. - [Furio] Not in English. (laughing) - I said no complaining. I'm saying now, I was trying to motivate you. - [Furio] I don't understand. I don't understand. - We're a team, please just chill. They're gonna kick us out. - So the team must cooperate. He doesn't cooperate with me. - And for the record, no we're not comparing you to Mickey M-- - No man. - No more, one more word man. One more word. - And I go out. - You're looking like crazy, you know? These are actors, these are actors and they-- - No no no don't say anything. Don't say nothing like that. - No but you can't choose. I mean, everything is being filmed and you signed the release form. So we agreed everybody. - Marco please. - You don't want to be nuts, don't be nuts. Oh take the phone man. Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch. (laughing) - Furio is [inaudible]. - I'm really fastidito [annoyed], stop it, seriously. - Okay okay. - I'm really serious, really. - Okay. - And he's outside, yeah, he felt all bad. We were having a smoke together, and he was feeling bad and he was like I'm so sorry, blah blah blah. I'm like it's okay. He's like I was getting so angry for the scene and then, and then... He was trying to explain-- - Alright, day one I want you to take this chair and break it against the wall. (laughing) (laughing) - [Marco] Okay slower, slower and take some pauses too. - From where Marco? - [Marco] "I like Claude", well let's do it again from there. "I like Claude." - [Mathieu] Yeah I know, are we ready? - Yeah we're still rolling. - Yeah I like... I like Claude. (foreboding music) - The first few days of the shoot, I had a very very difficult time. I was nervous because of my first scene. And then we got there and I never worked with any of these people. I mean, they've done a few scenes the day before with Furio only. It was a bit unorganized up there. A lot of it was one take and then we would move on. If there was no stumble in the lines we would just move on. I remember my close up and so many things threw me off after he said cut I thought for sure that we were going to do it again but then he just moved on, because we were pressed for time. So it's understandable, but that's something I really wasn't used to you know? Working at that speed and under that much pressure and that much chaos, and that really got me down and then there was a big fight that broke out. So I just had to leave. I was panicking a bit and I was wondering a little bit what I'd gotten myself into. Well I mean listen, at the end of the day, I'm 23 years old. I'm a young actor. I'm an emerging actor. I don't have a lot of experience under my belt especially not in film. So I'm in no position to have any demands or have any expectations out of anybody else. Coming here, it was hard because you don't know who you're gonna work with, and you know, at the end of the day if somebody doesn't do their job right it could jeopardize the whole project. - Well I grew up in Mexico. When I was 18 I moved to Canada and then... One year ago I went back to Mexico and stayed there for a year and I worked on a few projects there. Just because it's so easy there, and you have family and friends and locations for free. A lot easier. I guess it's not the same here. Like we don't know anybody here and it's hard to get locations. - Put the camera away? - Hello. - Hi. - Marco? - Put it behind you. - If we ask people something that might be like oh, stop bothering our customers. Get the fuck out. We don't ask him. Fuck it, you know, you want to be there? - Okay I need actors to come with me so we can book the, so we can reserve these tables. - Pressure. Working fast. I like working fast. This is the only way people seem to be working fast so. - Really nice view from there, because we can see outside. So that's good. Master shot. A few close ups, close ups a slider and that's it and may the Gods of guerrilla filmmaking be with us. - [Alejandro] I'll try and catch you guys from the outside. - You all get rabies now. - [Marco] Alright so, we're rolling we're rolling. Action. (jazzy cafe music) - Go? Beyond the mountains in the north of the city the rest of China centers and strains. Two of you only. Right, and action. - The audio was terrible. I mean terrible. I mean, I was far away. I had many interference, a lot of interference. The have music in the cafe. So we're gonna probably have to redo most of it. This is just what I didn't want to do. Anyway... - Yeah, I'm glad we finished this. I think it was a good lesson. Here we had one hour and we finished in one hour. So it's good to have a limit. - Well this was a lesson in guerrilla film making people. - [Mathieu] I think this was my favorite setting. - [Francisco] That was smooth. - [Marco] Isn't this the most professional crew you've ever seen? (laughing) - [Andrew] Okay to the, to the... - [Marco] To the mansion. (laughing) - And we were served by a girl named Christie Ho. Now Christie Ho is the best cashier in the history of McDonald's. She gave me a sundae and I specifically asked for no nuts and she gave me my sundae with no nuts in it. Christie Ho deserves a raise to four Hong Kong dollars an hour. - Key, right here. - Key, this is complicated negotiation. - Fuck. - Key is... (explaining in foreign language) - Okay I have just... (yelling in foreign language) - No absolutely not. I'm having a great time. Look at this nice pink sheets here, and look at my slanted mattress. You know, that's nice and then I think a mouse got to the foam here. He told me it was a little bit fucking budget when we were coming here but he didn't warn me like how budget it was and even if he had told me how budget it was I would have still came, but it was a very big shock when I put that key in the door, opened it, kicked open the door, and I hit the fucking bunk bed with the door because it's so small and then I'm sleeping on a piece of plywood with a fucking one inch fold mattress, and I got it better than my co-actors because they're sleeping on a fucking piece of plywood with a one inch slab of concrete. Our cinematographer squashed a cockroach this afternoon. After it was crawling on his face and I mean he's Mexican so he's used to that but that's not a big deal. Being in another location, going somewhere, sleeping in a fucking six foot by six foot room, being able to shit while I take a shower. Yeah, you know that is bonding you know? Having Furio fucking take a shit this morning and then I wanted to go take a shower and he's like, oh it does not smell, it does not smell, and I'm like bullshit Furio. It smells like fucking greasy Italian. That's what it smells like, and he goes it does not smell, it does not smell. It will go away. I must go have a smoke, and I go thanks you jerk. So yeah it's bonding, absolutely. There are some things at Hong Kong. Another thing I find that about Hong Kong that's wonderful is that people obey the rules, you know? When it say, when people says go up this way, up the stairs, and it has an arrow pointing up the stairs this way, everyone follows that rule. In Canada, if it had an arrow going stay to this side of the stay to this side of the fucking stairway to go up people just blatantly disobey and everything's so organized here. So, the Chinese are... - You have to watch this. - [Andrew] I did. - That was a great introduction. You see that Francisco? - [Francisco] No. - [Andrew] You can see some method Chinese acting here. (laughing) - I gotta take some cues from them. I thought my performance was off today. Now I fucking see what I was doing wrong. - We shot, I think it's scene number two. So it's a lot of the first scenes. We're just looking up at buildings and admiring city, and then we have a nice tracking shot of Patrick and Eli walking down the street and then talking about Armani and Fah. A beautiful tracking shot thanks to Francisco. - It was almost perfect. (calm guitar music) - It's a beautiful backdrop. This city is bustling. There's always something to look at here. It's a beautiful place to shoot a film. In a way it helps. It really puts you in the setting and it makes you feel a part of the city because you're experiencing it for the first time and so are the characters, and you're looking around like wow I've never been here before and this is quite amazing. - We're lucky we're in Hong Kong because the lighting here is really cool. There's tons of lights everywhere. Right now we're not lighting that much we're just making the actors stand where we have light. - Hong Kong visually is very interesting and because the movie's kind of dry, it's mostly just talking. You need an interesting backdrop. Hong Kong is like a giant set, like wherever you go you have something interesting to look at, and all those colors which really helps. - It's much easier to shoot stuff here. You don't need permits. You don't need all that paperwork, you don't need to go through so much hassle. You shoot a scene in the streets or on the subway. We could never have done something like this in North America. - I don't know if this is legal. - [Documentarian] Do you think we'll get in trouble? - If they catch us I believe yes. Well generally in all the cities that I have been to it's illegal to record in the metro stations. - Then he wouldn't... - [Alejandro] Okay move it, move it move it. - [Francisco] Well we need the train. - [Mathieu] Great. - Sorry man. Must be the meat. - I like this. Let's do it again though because I, you barely see the train. The train leaving is crucial. It's my bad, I called it too late. - [Documentarian] Are you in character now? - No. - [Documentarian] Too early? - Too early? Yeah, if I was in character, I wouldn't be talking or I'd be talking about philosophy. (inspiration music) - It's a story of this guy who just gets stuck in life and he just wants to disconnect and he just wants to start like from scratch, but literally from scratch. He wants to be surrounded with the people he thinks he loves and he thinks love him and he find that things are not the same you know, and it's like he crashes. I think that everybody does. Everybody has passed through something like this in his life. - It's long winded and there's too much dialog and there's too many pages. I don't know how many people he showed the script to but... - [Documentarian] Did you enjoy the script when you read it? - I enjoyed certain aspects of it and I thought that, you know, certain things could change because he was very open at the time he said to having, suggestions and I offered certain suggestions and he was not receptive to those suggestions at all. - No, you have to say "It's just a role". - Oh okay okay. - It is just a role, - [Andrew] What, being a rat? - [Marco] "Is it" - [Andrew] Marco, please. - What "please"? I'm trying to say, you know-- - "Is it". That is integral to the success of the scene? - Yes. - No it's not. - Yes. - I'm not gonna take that. - But if you forget it here... - Because you're Shakespeare, this is Shakespeare. I have to fucking... - I don't understand what's the problem with saying "Is it", do you mind? - Well you would say, in an argument like we were going, if I'm in a heated argument, I'm calling him a rat. I'd go, "of course I can". What would you call it? - But again this is not about a person. This is about this character, you know. - I don't think he got the script. I think he read it with his ass. I think he just learned it like, I don't know, two weeks before coming here. Which is true because we were rehearsing and he didn't know the script. I mean it annoys me. Just because, I don't know, because I'm young and I have no money or maybe because I'm not paying them. You know there isn't so much, I mean it is from some people, there isn't so much respect as if you know, I'm just the asshole and I don't think he would act like that with a paying production, no? And as far as I can tell, they didn't choose between projects and chose my project. They just got it because there was nothing else. I had in mind like a more intellectual kind of guy and this guy is stupid as fuck and he's playing him as stupid as fuck. He's being loud you know, when he should be subtle. He's being loud you know, when I say that you know, just subtly mock someone and he's just like you know screaming insults. Mathieu is doing more the character I had in mind, and even actually Furio. Furio I think is doing a better job, than Andrew. Yeah he's doing well. Yeah Andrew just has issues. I don't think even he wants to be an actor. He's just the kind of guy that just wants to be kind of famous. He just wants people to know he's an actor and just likes people to think he's an actor, but he doesn't really like to act. I feel nice (imitating guitar) Like sugar and spice (imitating guitar) I feel nice (imitating guitar) ♫ Like sugar and spice ♫ (imitating guitar) - I feel bad because Eli's supposed to be very excited in this scene, and I feel like I wasn't very excited, cus I looked tired. I hope it doesn't look like shit. I'm not sleeping very well at Chungking Mansions I think. On the plywood mattress. It's frustrating, I feel like my best takes I'm always off camera. Whenever the camera's on me I shit the bed. (tranquil music) I don't know when I exactly when I said this is what I want to do for the rest of my life. It started with curiosity and then wonder and then finally having the courage to try it and then from that passion for it growing and growing and growing. I've been in a period just before this film where I didn't do much acting work for several months in a row and I think that's what make me realize that I want to do this, because I wasn't doing it and there was something missing. Why do I trust this crew? What choice do I have? (laughing) But I do trust this crew now. At the beginning, there was no way of knowing. I mean, that was the scariest part, but you know, after a few days I started believing in people. I think it's obvious that we have a talented bunch of people here. We have a very talented technical team I think and I really do trust them, and again, I mean I think you kinda have no choice because if you don't trust the people you work with then you're not gonna create something good. - I had to quit my job to come here and finish a play and I was in a play as well that finished right before this. So I had to quit my job to do both of those. I don't know, nothing's perfect. Ideally I'd just like to be rich and not have to do anything. That I can afford to come to Hong Kong on my own money. Who am I taking the plane ride with? This man? - [Marco] This man, and a girl that's gonna take the documentary. So at least the whole Canadian group is coming together. So you're responsible to count yourself. You know, make sure, get a buddy. You know you're responsible for your buddy. - Absolutely. This is the most like characterish jacket I could wear. Like you know what I mean? Like, I didn't know what you want. I don't have like a nice like suit. - [Marco] No no that's good. You don't need something too good because if anything, the other guy is supposed to be the one who would wear something like that. - So I'm more life a ragamuffin. So then... - [Marco] Yeah yeah, try wearing this. - So we're looking at a 24 hour plane ride. Oh man eh, I've never been on a plane that long. I'm just gonna... - [Marco] Oh but there's gonna be movies and video games usually. - Really? I haven't been on a plane in a while. - [Marco] Usually, because they... - [Francisco] A screen there. - [Marco] It's not the shittiest company, I mean. I would have gotten the shittiest if it was available, but it wasn't. - I don't know, I wouldn't have done this film if it was set in Toronto. I joined a website that posts auditions for every fucking student god damn piece of shit film in existence. Any asshole that wants to put on a little bit of a movie can put their little ad up and you can go audition for them and I went and auditioned for horrid horrid things. Horrid, horrid, horrid, horrid, horrid, horrid, horrid, things. All these people that want to be film makers makes me want to vomit you know? And at first, I was interesting about like going to Hong Kong. Like what the fuck is going on here. Like, what are you? Hong Kong? Craziness. And then you know, I met him in person and he did one of the worst pitches I've ever heard a human being do. Oh the movie is not much happens and you know, the characters. It takes place in Hong Kong. You really have to read the script, and I was like okay... But you gotta understand this is back in August. So in the past four months I've seen a lot more and I've done a lot of shit on my own. So the novelty of getting this gig wore off. Besides, it doesn't make sense. I can understand him not showing up but... I don't know why he chose me. I don't know what the caliber of the other actors were. I know that if he's fishing in the dumpster for actors that are willing to do this for free. He's gonna get a lot of garbage. If he wanted actors that would have demanded some money they would have blown me out of the water, but they would have never done this. They would have spat at him if he said you get to come to Hong Kong and pay your transportation and your food. Well they'd go (spitting) Fuck you. - [Marco] If you're good now maybe we're gonna work together another time. - If I'm shit and an asshole then we'll never do it again I guess. - [Marco] Yeah or you know, maybe you're just gonna go to greater things and you're gonna be beyond us mortals. - Yeah right. Alright let's do it. - [Marco] Alright so just read your lines. - So you're gonna be a great father some day. - [Alejandro] Okay this is very important Furio. Do not bend. - [Furio] I have to sit down. - Yes you sit, but do not do like this. You're going to get up though. - So nothing 69 this evening. - Exactly. - I can't breath very well. - [Marco] It's okay, your character doesn't breathe. (laughing) - Are you okay? (laughing) No seriously, are you okay? - No I'm not okay. - Why didn't you say anything? - No, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay. I'm okay. - It's not like... - Water red eyes. - It's because I'm laughing at you. I am not cutting your circulation or anything like that now am I? - Inculation? - Circulation. (speaking foreign language) - Ah, circulation okay okay. Circulation is never good like now. Make everything you want. I'm ready to... Avenge my death. - We're in the seediest district of Hong Kong. Oh it's gonna be a bitch but, how great it is eh? Oh that's the one. This is great man if we can do it here. See places like this is why we came to Hong Kong. What do you think? Is it possible? - I just don't know if they're gonna kick us out. If we just put the camera there and just pretend like we're taking pictures. - I don't think we can just sit there and like finish out food and then just sit there and shoot. It's so busy there they gotta be like, okay next. - Well we're gonna take our time to eat food. I don't know, we're gonna order something else. We can have... If you haven't finished your food Do they want you to get out, or no? - Especially for foreigners. - Oh. - It's OK. - Oh awesome, and we're not going to be shooting a movie. We're just gonna take pictures of ourselves. - Yeah, if you say, not taking a movie, that's OK just pictures, photos - Okay see? - Let's say that. - Let's say that then. - Yes. - [Alejandro] This is so funny man. - It's not fun - You're under arrest. - Like a long black stick coming out from between my legs like this. - All the typical restaurants of Hong Kong, they wanted money. I remember one guy that wanted $4,000. So we decided to steal the shot. - We didn't even tell them we were shooting. We just grabbed two tables, set up, and then the way we're gonna do this scene is probably the most frustrating way to do a scene. We were feeding each other lines. So you'd have the camera close up on somebody, on me say and then the guy sitting next to me, would have the script right in front of him and then he would just tell me the line and I would say the line. - [Mathieu] It's so good. - It's so good! - [Mathieu] I told you, have some wine. - I told you, have some wine. Yeah, you got that? - [Marco] Again again again, sorry, again. - Which line? - [Marco] This one, someone they're looking at the camera. Tell them not to look at the camera. - Who? - I order just like a dish of rice, nothing else you know? And after we stopped ordering and we went on shooting and I start to feel very bad you know, because I saw that behind the actors, the owner of the restaurant like was starting to get pissed and he was forcing us to order every time, and Marco was like every time he complains just order a beer and I was like dude, we are people. Don't do this to the guy, you know? Stop filming me because the guy's looking at us. - Oh Furio eating chicken. Poor guy, he's got a moment in this scene where he's got to eat a piece of meat and go, yeah this is really good, and Furio does not eat anything apparently. He's a very sheltered Italian boy. - It's good, very good. - So he would take the chop sticks and put it in his mouth and go, it's good, it was very good, and then go (gagging) spit it right back out. (laughing) And then Marco would be like, we have to do it again, and then Furio would go, absolutely not! I cannot do it again! He didn't figure out that he could fake chew the meat. He could just put it on his tongue and fake chew it. I don't know if he's a method actor but he insisted on actually chewing the meat. - It's good, very good. - Ah, this is a piece of shit man. - [Mathieu] You've seen it? - [Marco] No but this is Garry Marshall. She does all these romantic comedies. They do make all of these holiday movies now. I think I'm an artist, not that the sense that I'm great, or that I'm brilliant (tranquil music) but I'm trying to say something and I'm trying to put a vision and realize it and it might be bad. It might be, you know, but I might just have completely bad ideas but at least I tried to make something that I thought was good. Which is more than most studios are doing now. They're just getting stuff out and they know it's bad because they think people have bad taste. They think people have no taste what so ever and you can just cram what ever piece of shit in their throat and they're gonna get it. They just try to play it safe and they do the easiest thing which is just to impose a standard, a very low standard. They are not making art. They're just selling a product. So they behave just like any other brand making a product. If it's easier to make you know, slapstick comedy and it's easier with a slapstick comedy to make a lot of money, that's what you're gonna do. - [Andrew] He doesn't think all Hollywood films are a piece of shit. If some fucking guy offered him to direct their Hollywood film, I highly doubt he would go "oh no, I'm gonna be a translator in Canada living in my shitty basement". You know, people get up on these high horses, but they don't mean it. They're full of shit. It's like the guys that say oh I'd never sleep with a girl in a one night stand. Well that's because women are not throwing themselves at them. If they had a girl come up to them at a bar and say, you know, let's go back to my place and she was attractive, you think in one second those guys would say no? And I'm not an artist guy. I'm not pro art. I don't want to be a starving artist. What's the difference between being a starving artist, and being a starving stock broker? It's the same shit. Yeah art is artistic expression and all that crap, but you what? At the end of the day, it's a business like everyone else. If it's just the art well then sit at your home and act in front of your camcorder. - Hoop dreams, and Salesman. - [Andrew] Grizzly man, Grizzly man. - Salesman is really good. - [Andrew] Oh yeah, yeah yeah, you've seen that? - Have you seen it? - [Andrew] Yeah of course I've seen that. I've seen that a bunch of times. - Oh Glengarry Glen Ross that was one of the best movies. - [Mathieu] Oh what a great film. - Though direction is not that great. It's I don't know, it feels kind of like it's on a stage. Even the movie, the way... - [Mathieu] It's a play right? - Yeah but it feels kind of like its err-- - [Andrew] Forrest Gump's another one of my favorite movies. - Oh man, Forrest Gump? Come on, that's bullshit. - [Andrew] That's an amazing movie. - What's amazing about it? - Tell me what point of the movie is, what is the... - [Andrew] It's just a wonderful story. - [Mathieu] I love that movie. - [Andrew] It's just a wonderful story. - But it's completely unlikely. - [Andrew] It's a wonderful Hollywood film. You know, he's ignorant because he comes from a small town and you know, he faces a lot of adversity because of his charm and a lot of that he pulls through, and I don't think it's realistic and I agree with you that it's not real. - One time George Bush Jr. Had a speech in a university and he said like, you know, when I was a kid I wasn't very good. They said I was a bit slow. I wasn't getting the best grades and I got in trouble with the police and that shows you that you know, you don't have to have the best grades. You don't have to be that smart. - [Andrew] You can still have a rich daddy. - You can still make it in life. That was the message it was trying to give and that's the message that Forrest Gump is giving. You don't have to be-- - [Andrew] I don't think they really tell you that message. - But maybe not, but that's why so many people like it, because again, if it was someone like that studied or someone that worked hard or somebody that was just you know, more intelligent or more educated, maybe some people would have liked it, but not as many because they would have been like oh this guy thinks he's better than me but because he's kind of like slow and naive and innocent. Then you know, you can just think like okay obviously-- - [Andrew] Why is that wrong? - Because it's manipulating. You're creating a character for a purpose. - [Andrew] Every movie's manipulating. - Suit. These tailors man. - Oh my... How do they make money? - Someone must stop. Like, did I hear tailor? Where were you? - Suits. Hashish, cocaine... - Here's your suits. How many grams of suit do you want? - Yeah exactly. - I'm excited for tonight. Certain people of a certain descent get drunk relatively easily, and one and a half beers and they're all flustered and making bad decisions. Back in Canada, I've done some crazy and silly things on new years and I've had more than one and a half beers in me. - Marco? - What up? - What time is like, return time? - [Marco] I don't know, don't come back after two. - Yeah. - Unless you're getting crazy footage. - You see... Snakes on a plane? - Snakes on the plane? - Si. - Snakes is, the snake yeah? - Snake. - On the... - On the Aero, sul aereo. - Snakes on the plane? Why snakes on the plane? - It's a movie. So we have 12 days left, 12 days left here. You have three days. Tre giorni. - The most hard three days of my life I think. I'm so tired. - [Documentarian] Why are you so tired? - It's a sub human condition to work this one. You have to admit it. - Yeah - Fuck. - So if we're a half an hour late, what happens? - It's green too, let's go. - I met a nice girl from Taiwan last night. I think she expected us to buy her drinks but I don't think she knew who she was dealing with. And I don't really blame them, I mean. You do what you gotta do but, you can't pull the wool over my eyes, or if you can then you're really really good at what you do. I'd buy my mother a drink though, but she does a fair amount for me like cooks me dinner and washes my feet. ♫ Heigh-ho heigh-ho ♫ It's off to work we go ♫ - Is this funny to you? Grab it. Oh fuck, man. This is funny. I've done a lot more grip work than I have fucking... I've done a lot more production assistant work than I have acting. - I'm just so hungry man. - Me too. - I'm thirsty. I'm telling you we should create a union and demand for our rights, our worker rights. - We signed that shit away. - Yeah but that shit didn't say that we had to work 40 hours a day. Bye bye Hong Kong. ♫ I believe that my heart will go on ♫ - [Andrew] I'm king of the world! - I'm already tired. This fucking bag is, I'm the delivery man. A kiss to my fans. - We need another one Alejandro. ♫ I need a hero ♫ (laughing) - Yes, maybe I'll take off my shirt. My chest had lots of chest hair here and then it has a line that goes down to my belly button which further goes down to my genitalia. - Andrew's showing you his penis? Oh man, very classy guy. Andrew, we have the poster for the documentary ready. - [Andrew] My testicles? - Your testicles. - I wouldn't dare show my penis. That'd be vulgar. - [Marco] Yeah that'd be childish right? - Yeah. - So... - When? - Ask the driver to take you to blah blah blah, okay uphill now. That way? I had put an ad in Reddit saying like if you guys know somebody in Hong Kong who has a restaurant or whatever that can help us out and then there's this girl just offered us a place, but in the beginning I thought that she was very like disorganized you know? She say like, okay we'll meet this day at the island at 8:00 in the morning. We were like okay, nice, perfect. We got there and the bar was closed. - 14 yeah? - 14 yeah so this is it. - It's this one? - Yeah 14, yeah. - Awesome man. - No not awesome because it's closed. - [Mathieu] We are late aren't we? - 17 minutes, not much. - [Marco] Do we leave a message? - Yeah, is this still happening? We're here, please call us asap. - Hi Kirsten it's Marco. We're just us here so can you give us a call or just come down to the beach. Thank you, bye bye. (tranquil music) - Now I can keep from morning to night. - Oh man, there's always something, no? - Yeah well I have... - Come on. (exasperated sighing) - Armani relaxing time. - [Andrew] Make-a sexy time. - No, another time. If I can't become a great actor, I'll become a porn actor. Porn actor. - [Andrew] Porn actor. (speaking foreign language) - How do you say? - Cinema. - No but, adult cinema. - Man his Italian is really getting on my nerves. Stop Andrew stop it. You're putting me in a bad mood with your Italian. - [Furio] Hey I'm not stupid to like the Italian language. - [Marco] Oh say it man, you were saying... you make fun of my English. - I never make fun of your English. - [Marco] You make fun of my accent. - I've made fun of your accent maybe once. - Well yeah, not making fun... It's really annoying... - Why because I'm trying to talk to him? - Even his English is annoying - So then what's the problem? - His English is more funny than your Italian. - Well no because you're a prick so shut your mouth. I'm tired of this shit. - And not that attitude man, what is this? - I have no attitude. - Well you just called me a prick. - Well you are being a prick. That's a fact that's not an insult. - Wow that's not a fact. I mean you're the one that's showing me no respect. - Oh right. - We are having a private chit chat. - Private chit chat. - Yeah. I want an apology. - [Marco] I want an apology. - For what? - [Marco] You called me a prick. - You are being a prick. You're being a jerk to me. - Well am I being a jerk? I don't think you're cooperating. - [Andrew] I was ready this morning before anybody. I'm cooperating, I had my lines better than anybody so don't give me that. - I'm saying you made fun of me, you made fun of everybody - Who did I make fun of? - You make fun of everybody. - Who? - You talk shit all the time and I'm saying it's fine - [Andrew] No I don't. No I don't talk shit. - You talk shit all the time. You talk shit all the time. Come on, you talk shit and it's fine. - I'm not saying talk shit. - Who do I talk shit? - Okay maybe, I'm saying you joke all the time. - So? - And I joke too. - No you don't, you're not funny. - Alright, and you're not funny either. - Well I am funny. - Oh that's what you think. - I have a lot of people that testify to me being funny. - You're 29 years old and you behave like a child so be quiet. - No I mean, first of all stop giving this attitude because as far as I know, I'm still your boss. - That's great. - Yes. Because I mean, just because I'm 29 and you know, you don't have to treat me like an asshole. - Well you are being an asshole to me. If I want to speak Italian to him I have every right to do so. - Well then I have every right to say that you sound bad, because I mean-- - You are right. I do sound bad. I do sound horrible, but I have the right to practice and his English, he wants to practice with me. So I have every right. - Well I mean, you can do it whenever, but I mean now because we're not here for your holidays. - Nope we're not, but we're not shooting right now and why? I don't want to get into that, but... - Why are we not going to get into that? - Well I think it's clear. - Why is it clear? Why are we not shooting? Because I'm a bad organizer? - Yeah. - You want to help? Yeah, you want to help? - No no. - Do you want to help organize, because you're such a team player. - Why would I? Then drive yourself to the airport. I haven't done anything for you. - Oh man come on. - I haven't done anything for you. - Look I mean, every time we had to rehearse you came late. You find like my aunt is having a birthday. That stuff, I mean that stuff is really unprofessional. You come, you don't know your lines, you yawn all the time when we were rehearsing. - I don't think that's true. I have to chase after you to rehearse. I have to email you going, Marco what's going on? What ever happened to you? - Don't go into that because you're really pissing me off. - Well it's true. I wanted nothing but the best for this film, but I have to deal with your bullshit. - No I have to deal with your immaturity. - I am not immature. - Well okay that's what you think man. - Take my perspective then you might disagree. - I think your perspective... I take a lot of people's perspective, but I don't value yours enough to fucking internalize it. - See, so see, you show no respect at all. - Not now, not now. - No never, never, never show respect. - Calm down, we are all friends. We are here to make the movie. It's important to play the relaxed environment is... - Yeah that's fine. - Okay. Well okay then, I mean... - And you make, everything to make the environment not relaxed. - Well you know what he is? Get this on camera. It's he's stressed about his own thing. He's angry, and I find that he's not someone that brings up the energy or makes things happier. You know, I'll be laughing about something. Saying oh, I'm king of the world, being whatever. Just goofing around on the boat. Oh no you're not. You're constantly you know, a negative guy. - You're just constantly annoying. You really annoy me, you annoy me. I mean honestly-- That's okay, that's okay, but you don't be a baby and just do stuff like that. - Well let me tell you, you annoy me. - Okay, say that. - Then try to keep a sober attitude. Because that annoys me. - Fine, fine. Then why don't you come and tell me that to myself. You know, we can talk privately. - Okay then I mean, I'm saying when we're away. - No, so you say it in front of everybody. It has to get to this point. That's a good leader. - Alright well, just make a good scene okay. - Yeah sure maybe. - Yeah maybe...? - I don't know if I want to anymore. - Yeah that's mature right. - Right. - Well I mean, you're the one that is gonna suck. - I don't give a shit. - Yeah right, that's mature. That's mature. - Get me a scene to act in and maybe. - Get me a scene to act? I mean, do you think that I like this? Like, are you helping? Is this a team player attitude? - Oh it was. - [Andrew] Stop this, this is like... (laughing) - I was gonna say that. - Suck each other's dicks. - Hand job all around, it's gratitude. - In a circle. - Because she didn't arrive on time. - I am so sorry. - Let me open up. - No worries. - It's okay. - That's how we do. What can we do, eh? We just have to swallow... - [Mathieu] Cheers. (glasses clanging) - [Marco] Yeah, do we have something dark that we can hang or something? - I am not good with manual works. Why he asked me to do this? - I walked away. I saw the beginning, and then I went by the beach with Francisco. - From now on, I'm gonna keep my opinions to myself and let's pretend everything is fine. So at least we get nice shots. I mean I can't risk that anymore. So everybody all of the time, I'm gonna be like yeah, good job, well done! You know, that's what they do in Hollywood. They just full of shit. Then I guess that's how I'm gonna become. You know, just become like an asshole and always smile. So everybody's happy doing their job, because then obviously they're not mature enough to do what they're supposed to do. - This just reeks of so much bullshit. - Hey take it easy man. If you have to be pissed at somebody it should be Fah. - Oh he'll get his fair share of abuse when he gets here. Right now I'm gonna let exchange have it. - [Furio] My name is Armani. - How angry should I be when I say that's what I said? - [Marco] That's not angry. That's more like ironically, like that's what I said, because you're kind of mocking him. - That's what I said. I have had a lot of issues in the past working jobs in restaurants and stuff because my bosses have their own insecurities and stuff and when they see someone that they deem a smart alec like myself, it doesn't gel well. They think I'm a piece of shit. They think that I'm anti authority and that I don't respect them, which is not necessarily the case. That's just me you know? And I said to Marco when we were having a bit of a tiff, you're not gonna change me because I've weighed the pros and cons and some people will like me and some people won't like me but I'm prepared to deal with that because if everyone likes you then you're doing something wrong and if everyone doesn't like you then you're also doing something wrong but I fall maybe 60% people like me, 40% don't and I'm fine with that. Some people want 80, 90% but there's certain sacrifices you have to make to have that many people like you and I'm not prepared to make those sacrifices because I'm a little bit stubborn. - Camera rolling. Audio rolling. OK so roll one, scene six A, take one. (clipboard clacking) - [Marco] And action. - Questa? [This one?] - No. - One or four. Where are we going? - There is an explorer who is lost in the desert. From a days, a lot of days. He's dying because he has no food, no water, nothing. Before to die, he'd like to have a last time sex, but there are no womans. So he had only his old female camel. Better than nothing. He put down his pants. Is right pants? - Yeah. - Take a... and at the last moment, the camel moves, and he goes... (speaking foreign language) - he hits a rock? - He hits a rock. He try more and times, but at the last moment, the camel always moves. (speaking foreign language) - Suddenly. - Suddenly, he saw a beautiful woman totally naked, who run, followed by a lion. He takes a shotgun, pow pow, shoots and he kill the lion. The beautiful woman comes to him. You're my hero, I make everything for you. You saved my life. He thinks a lot and tell her, keep my camel firm. (speaking foreign language) - Keep my camel steady. - Keep my camel steady. (laughing) It was not funny? - No. - No funny? - [Natalia] How did it go? - Another day of drama. Fucking Andrew complained before. (laughing) - [Natalia] What? - [Alejandro] How did it start? - Oh because he was talking crap in Italian again, and I told him like, man I can't stand your Italian anymore and he just got so offended and he starts to insult me. If he was just, you know, talking to me and there was no movie involved, I would just, yeah man, beat the shit out of this guy. Obviously no, I'm everybody's bitch. I can't do shit. So I just have to pretend everything's fine, we're friends, but we're not. You pissed me off from the beginning. He does a decent job with his role because I mean, he has to play an asshole and he's an asshole so... Well we just have to mount it and just put it there as if it was one their toys that they leave there, for like 10 minutes, just so we can take some shots. Come on, are they coming man? This lady said she's help but I have to buy these fucking spoons, that were like 70 bucks. - Look in a bit of a trance. You're really, captured by these penguins. - The penguin scene, oh man. The penguin scene. Well, the movie opens with a close up of this little penguin toy, this little slide. These penguins go up the stairs and then they slide, and then they go up the stairs. You can't interact with this toy at all, it's useless. It's not even a toy, it's a decoration. - This is our movie. - There were so many tourists and locals just gathered around because we've got three cameras pointing at this little stupid toy, you know, these little penguins and people. Like what is with this toy? Why, why are you taking pictures of this toy? They couldn't figure it out and then I'm sitting there just mesmerized, taken away by it. You could just tell they're all looking at me like, is this person just not understanding this? Like is he just stupid? Like, what's he looking at? You know, it's interesting to shoot in the streets and the chaos of that. You get a lot of weird looks. You really have to get over yourselves and forget about what you look like and forget about what people think because they can't help but be intrigued by what we're doing. - [Marco] Go down, awe. - Because we didn't have a lot of time and Marco was just rushing and he looked really stressed. He was trying to fix a penguin and it wasn't working out and he was just like shaking the penguins. And then he wanted to change the frame. So instead of asking me to change the frame, he just took the camera and moved it. Yeah, some people don't work well under stress. - Hey, everybody likes the penguins. - [Mathieu] Well hurry. Those penguins man, assholes. Can we just make it seem like they're stuck, like this? - But I like to see that they're kind of... This thing should be moving. - Well shit man. - What if you take this off? - I was laughing because I was just like, it was just funny because the kind of guy Marco is, he's very like antsy. Like he's in a million places at once. You've got so many things going on in his head right? And he was trying to make the one penguin stuck. You know, he just couldn't figure it out and he kept dropping it on the floor and kicking it away and oh man, and in my head I just feel like, why didn't you figure this out at the hotel room? (laughing) - Well they were working too well. They weren't getting stuck. Which is what they're not supposed to do. They're supposed to be going smoothly up the stairs and then go on the slides, but when I got them stuck. They were stuck. - Actually I have never seen him not being stressed. I cannot read him, you know, at all. Sometimes you think he's joking but he ain't. Sometimes you think he's serious but he's laughing you know? I mean, I cannot tell you if I have seen him stressed. I cannot even tell you if I have seen him happy or sad, or pissed, no. - As it is now, it's interesting. I like the way it's coming out but it is not fun. It's just too stressful. But yeah I don't know, it would just be nice to have a producer I guess. Someone that is in charge of having the schedule, making sure everything cost enough money and we have it. Making sure everybody shows up. Making sure everything works, because now there's too many things to do, and because of that the performers suffer because I can't direct people too much, and then people are also not cooperative and anyway. It's getting the best, to be the best with even these circumstances. - I don't know. Just have a walk, I cannot stand this smell of beef, man it's terrible. - I don't know, man, it depends. - No you can go, but. - No no no, well we have to check those things on the ADR. - [Marco] Let's just check Furio quickly. (laptop voices) - [Marco] That's the one in the bar, no? - Yep. - I really want an egg Mcmuffin. - [Alejandro] The Big Mac is on sale. - Is it? So is Mussolini all ready? - Looking for a place. I don't know, in the middle of nowhere I guess. - [Andrew] So you scoped this location out eight weeks ago? - Last year. - Trying to make a feature movie in like three weeks? That's a lot and with no funds. So I think everybody's holding up pretty well. - [Marco] So yeah, how's Asian Christmas anyway? - Actually I didn't spend Christmas here. I only spent boxing day, which is also a holiday in Hong Kong. - So how's Asian boxing day then? - Well I don't know, I was still pretty jet lagged. So my mind wasn't that sharp. - Sounds good. - [Mathieu] Master or close up? - [Marco] Master now. - Oh my god! - Oh my god! (screaming) - Dude, what's wrong with you? - I need to fucking get out of this place. - [Marco] And slowly walk toward that way. - When you have no free time, you eat nothing. - Maybe the walk. And then, no actually, the spot itself. It's a very noisy place. Like they're drilling on, fixing cars all the time you know? It just makes my stuff a little bit harder, a lot harder. I believe that he should have seen first where we were coming, before coming. - My name is Armani. (drums and harmonica music) - What? (laughing) - We're switching hostels, to a yeah, to a much cleaner more civilized and beautiful place. I'm not sure about that. - It's better. I don't feel like a king, but I feel like a prince. - The mattresses feel like they're actually mattresses. That's the real stuff. No styrofoam for us here. - Before it was like, you know, very few selected people were working in movies, and they were making a shitload of money. Now everybody's gonna be working then, but there's not gonna be as much money as before. They might not even make any money at all. - [Andrew] If you think in the sense that everyone can have a freedom of expression but, I haven't seen the quality of work. - But of course, but if you give a camera to a million people you know, like 900,000 are gonna film their cat or they're gonna film their ass farting. That's obvious, but then you're gonna have at least 100,000 people making something good. When before maybe, you only had five people making something good and you know, because they were the only ones that had access to it. So now you have to swim through a sea of mediocrity, but then you can find something decent. - [Andrew] I think that it used to be better before back in the day, it was more like sports. If you're the best, you know, you get the biggest paycheck, you get the best. In film making I feel that if you worked hard enough back in the day I felt the work spoke for itself a little more. - Then why did someone like Wells you know, died almost in poverty, and he was like you know, a genius and he made some of the best movies. It wasn't just about that because it's an industry and it's about money. Back then especially, you weren't just supposed to be good. You were supposed to be good and make money. - [Andrew] I listen to a lot of music and all this shit and I just don't hear... - Oh but obviously there is more shit than before. There is more shit than before. Because most people don't have talent, but the few people that have talent, that didn't have a chance before, are gonna have a chance now. (speaking foreign language) - On a scale one to 10, I give it about a three and half. I guess my favorite scene, I don't really know. I guess I don't have one. But I'll be happy when it's over. - He's looking for a location. Now. He cannot hear me complaining because you come here with a camera like a paparazzo I don't know, like half an hour, more or less. Not sure. Maybe more. (tranquil music) - I just can't justify the way we shot. I can't help but feel resentful, when I feel my time's being wasted, and not being wasted in the sense that circumstances beyond our control, like the weather, but really just going to a place and having us wait around while you go scope a scene that you don't even know where it's gonna be. It's just that I really became very resentful. You get warmed up, you'd have the lines going and then you'd be waiting around for hours. You know, he's always justifying whatever he does. Why should I plan in advance? Why should we have a location scouted beforehand, so we know where we're going and we can do this, chop chop you know? It makes sense to go and have you guys wait around, but at least have an idea. We went to a lot of places just blind. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Alright, let's go. - It wasn't, you know, at 4 o'clock we're gonna be there and everything's gonna be ready to shoot. No, I mean I had to go there at four and look for the best spot and I think I was pretty good at it, because you know, it's not like we went there and we walked for hours looking for a place. We went there, maybe half an hour, maybe an hour when I was really slow, and then I was like: that's it. That's the scene and that's how this scene is gonna be. I think if shoot guerrilla style you have to do that. You really have no choice. In a way it's better because it's the location that sets up the scene and not vice versa and that makes it realistic but on the other hand, you can't really pre-plan. You plan in like five seconds. Okay we're gonna go from there to there. You're gonna have to do this and this and this. If I just had a stage I would have to say you know, I would want the set to look like this and this and this and this and this and this, but when I come here, it's Hong Kong telling me how the scene is gonna look like. That influences me, it gives me more to work with, everybody's an extra, everything adds to the realism. It's kind of like you know, the French Nouvelle Vague from the 60s when people just went to Paris and started to shoot. - Yeah. - [Marco] We like traffic, we like challenges. - OK stay on the left then but then turn on the right on the second one. Cars are gonna be coming all the time, but as you can see people walk, they carry shit. So we should be able to walk too. Okay scene seven A take four. (clipboard clacking) - Oh lonely Saturday afternoons, They still filled with shame and regret? (intimate calm music) Today we shot a very very long tracking shot though the streets, through traffic, though all these locals walking around in a very very busy part of town. To do a full scene like that, I mean like no cutting and just you get into the flow of the scene and it's really fun and you're on location. There was nothing staged, we didn't have extras, we didn't have nothing. We're the only two people that are fake. It was us two and the camera. Everything else was real. You know, everything else is Hong Kong. It's the streets of Hong Kong. With Francisco on steady cam and Marco and Alejandro dodging into places and trying to stay out of frame and that was cool. I absolutely loved that. - This was like a fucking nightmare. I mean we had to like duck so we wouldn't get into the frame. Move people away. I mean we've been doing it for like a couple of weeks now but not for eight minutes, and not in the busiest road. So that was quite something. I mean, that was fun. - Yeah. - The background looks fucking great. - Good. I almost... I thought a couple of times that those were the last moments of my life because there was like a huge truck coming. The camera was in front of me and I didn't know what to do, but anyway, I survived. - You know, I get resentful because I feel like I'm gonna look like an asshole on screen. The sound guy, you know, he can hide behind the sound and months later work on the sound and make it beautiful. The camera guy, well he hides behind the camera and as long as whatever he's shooting is pretty, he doesn't give a fuck, but us, you know, I'm looking like an asshole on screen because I'm dodging out of fucking the way of some shit. Not knowing what I'm doing and you're the guy that everyone's laughing at. You know, you're the face of this film. - [Marco] You weren't supposed to shave here though. - I did shave, touch it. - Yeah, you weren't supposed to shave there. - Oh... - Oh god dammit. - No comment. - I think you're in trouble. - One of those times, which was about three days ago you said for that particular scene leave the beard. Okay, now I don't understand what days I've shaved. - [Marco] Well why didn't you ask then? - But you said shave, you said shave. So I've never since you've known me, ever came to your place with a goatee or anything. - Can we make him look like he has... I don't know, like a pencil or something? - So we are putting eye liner on Andrew's face, because he shaved a little too much off today, and it's not consistent with the shots. - We had talked previously about being clean shaven, and I was clean shaven the first day. I asked him the next day, I said what do you think? And I think he was just... his mind was preoccupied he said, yeah yeah, and I had scruff. I just wanted to know in advance and at no point was it clear what was happening and maybe I should have made more of an effort to figure out what I was gonna do, but I was pissed because you know, he would wait until the last minute and then I'd get all this irritation because I'd be shaving without anything. I'd be shaving on the fly and I'd get all itchy and shit and I was pissed. You know, it's something childish to get pissed about but you know, things like that compound. It's like in a marriage when people are pissed off about someone squeezing from the middle of a toothpaste tube and that's what sets it off, but there's so many underlying issues. - Do you want to see it? - No. I don't care. I just say the lines, you know. To me it's pretty inconsequential. (laughing) - No spitting here, but here it's okay. - [Marco] Can you buy one? Can you buy one, what do you think? Let's go to Yau Ma Tei, we'll see there. Where are they? Hey where are you? We're in front of the station, Mong Kok. - I believe waiting is the thing we have been doing the most in this trip, even more than shooting, waiting. Waiting, waiting... - But that's what film making's about. - No it is not what film making's about. It is a lazy director. That's what a lazy director's about. Film making is about waiting on the set, not waiting for somebody to go to the 7-Eleven without even telling the others that he's going to the 7-Eleven. That's not what film making's about. - Yeah yeah, we probably should. Alright come on, maybe we can find him before the celebration starts. And then they start walking and I guess we stop at the end of the corner. - I don't know. You know, I'm pretty good at analyzing the situation and knowing what the problem is. Because I can say, oh well I'm frustrated but this is film making. Hurry up and wait is basically it. - Very boring. I guess I'm just not excited enough to be doing what I'm doing right now. - It's in you know, everybody's interest to make the best movie you know? It's not like you know, Gene Hackman doing Superman. You know, he has a lot of money. He's just doing it because he wants more money. He doesn't give a shit about the movie. These people need, just as I do, they need recognition. They need this movie to be good. - I don't feel good you know, it's... When you play Street Fighter and the fighters have like their life or their blood or whatever, I'm like almost at the end. That's how I feel, like I'm almost done. (station intercom announcing) ♫ Everybody ♫ Yeah ♫ Rock your body ♫ - It's gotten to that point. - [Alejandro] Doesn't it look nice like this? - We're here, we have nothing else to do. Why not do it? - [Andrew] And we spent 40 minutes coming here. Think of the content of the scene. He's talking about being alone, wanting to get away from everything, starting a new life. - [Marco] Okay you're just finding excuses because you want to do it now, but it doesn't work. - [Andrew] No I don't think... - I'm not finding excuses because I want to do it now. I definitely believe that at this very moment the city's ours. We can go in the middle of the street. We can have like the shot of the whole city. Absolutely beautiful man. It's like there you have Hong Kong. - [Marco] Yeah but it wouldn't make sense. Like why would the city be empty? The scenes were you want quietness. That's the island scene. That's why it's there. It's to give a contrast with all the busyness. - Alright guys let's go home. Good day today. - I have 200 Hong Kong dollars in my pocket, and I think 80 Canadian and that's it. You can tell me whatever explanation you want, but my pocket is getting empty and once it is empty, I cannot move anymore. So it's better that we just start thinking about how to spend the money. How do you feel about spending 10 more dollars man? - [Francisco] I don't have money. - [Marco] I can give you 10 dollars both but, we go there, and we do it right. I mean, it's not about doing it half-assed. - I don't want to skip it because I'm lazy. I'm sorry but you're making it sound like that. - Not it's not about lazy. - I mean, if there is somebody who has been working after you in this film. - It's like me. - [Marco] I'm not implying that. I'm just saying that this shot might work, but it doesn't work as well. - I understand but it doesn't work as well that I have no money you know? - [Marco] Okay well, I'll pay the 10 bucks for the other... - So all I gotta do is complain and I'll start getting money too? I mean, I'm just as broke as these guys. - [Marco] Yeah but, you haven't worked as hard as he did. - Oh okay, so now then maybe I should just, I don't work hard at all. - Okay then let's fuck it. I just won't shoot anything. Let's do more blackmailing no? - [Andrew] No. - Well yeah, it was that. I mean, you've been giving troubles, no, they've been helping and he's been helping since before the movie started. - How have I been trouble? For the camera, what have I done to be difficult? Go ahead. What have I done? - I mean just in general. I mean if I say something you get offended. If I say let's do this shave, you get offended. - I don't get offended. I get irritation. So I say, can I know in the morning what the shaving situation is gonna be like? You won't do that. - Alright well anyway-- - Anyway, you always have an excuse, and you can just say, you know what? You're right. From now on, I'll try and do that, but you don't say those things. You never do. - Right, well you never take responsibility for your actions either. - [Andrew] I take responsibility for everything I do. - Okay, well anyway this is too long. - [Andrew] But then I'll shave, and I'll shave it all. - No can you just trim it a bit? - [Andrew] I don't have a trimmer. - [Marco] Okay well then we'll just paint it on. - I'm not gonna paint nothing on my face. That's ridiculous. I look like a fool. - Oh man. - He refuses to show vulnerability or admit that he's wrong (somber music) and it shows a lot of strength in a person I feel to admit when they're wrong. People are forgiving on the most part. If you said, look guys I fucked up. You know, I thought it was the right decision at the time. Most people go, well fuck I can't fault you for that, but it's when you fuck up and everyone knows that you know you fucked up, and you still just won't admit it you know? - Do you think that's affected your acting? - Absolutely. Absolutely, it made me hate him. It made me fucking hate him. - [Francisco] Okay I'm rolling. - [Marco] Scene, four issues take four. (clipboard clacking) - So how's Asian Christmas anyway? - [Marco] It's just annoying having to argue with people. I mean, don't you agree that this scene looks better today than yesterday? Yesterday was really kind of dead, but everybody was like, it's fine. It can still kind of work. Oh you know, you're just being difficult, being picky, and it's like now it just looks better and everybody can agree it looks better. I'm just trying to serve the movie here. All these scenes that people don't want to reshoot, all these scenes that people said they're perfectly fine. You know, it works anyway. Why are you being so difficult? When they're gonna see the finished film, they're gonna be like oh, those scenes are really nice. I'm so glad we did it again. Right? - You know what? I feel very good because I feel like I got a big hemorrhoid removed. (laughing) There's a couple more hemorrhoids that I need to get removed but those will be removed in the next couple days. (laughing) - It's transferred now? - Yeah. Give me 10 minutes. (exasperated sighing) - Can you? Thank you. (razor buzzing) - [Mathieu] That's it? - [Francisco] That's it. - I don't think you're gonna be able to see the difference. - These are the details that make or break a film. (laughing) That guy, his beard is longer today! We're not watching this movie. You're disqualified from Sundance. (laughing) - [Andrew] It's done. - Hmm? - [Andrew] It's done. - Is it? - [Andrew] Yeah. - I think it looks different. Come and see the shot. - [Andrew] I don't need to. We are charging the hair trimmer and we tried already but it died. So within the next few minutes it should be back in action. - Alright awesome. - [Andrew] Yeah. - You want the movie to be stupid? You know, this is supposed to take place one split second afterwards, and we have a huge close up of you, and we can see your beard. So it's not just you know, me being picky about you know, door handle in the background. It's like a close up of you. - [Andrew] I know. - Yeah, so let's get it right. - [Andrew] Oh of course. - It's not working. (razor buzzing) - You all have been very hostile. for the most part. Most of you have been hostile. - That's how you feel? - No no, that's not how I feel. That's a fact. They just snapped I guess, which is fine but they take it against the movie and black mailing. - What do you think made them snap? - Because it's hard, it's a lot of work. It's stressful. The group got... got together sharing the hatred for me. So if anything now, the crew is more compact. Everybody is friends with each other. I just think it's unfair because if you have a problem personally you shouldn't take it against the movie and black mail and damage the movie in any way which is what you're doing and I think it's very stupid. Every suggestion I got was to work less, or to make scenes easier, not to make the movie better. I never heard something like oh it's you know... Let's make it more challenging. Let's make the scene a different way, which is harder. It's always been like, it's okay. It's good enough. Two weeks of hostility is nothing compared to two years of grief, getting this movie done. - So it's making you very angry. - I mean, it makes me angry at the moment, but it's OK, in the end it's the movie that counts. (somber jazz) - The minute that camera wrapped I was happier than a pig in mud, because I owe him nothing anymore. Looking back I feel very sad about my performance and there's no one really to blame but myself. You can blame other people but it's really all on me about how I performed but, I'm a little disheartened. You know, I think I did some good work but for the most part I had no idea what I was doing. I was like shaving in the dark. I feel like shit because I just don't like looking like a piece of shit on screen. You know, I just want to be done and I just want to go home and never look back really. Maybe I won't be as angry in a month or so, but I don't know what's gonna happen. So I'm scared a little bit. - The last scene. At least the movie's pretty much done. - So the last scene is with Mathieu? - Yep. This time there's full masters and then close ups and details. As if they were looking at him. When it rings, you cannot look at it and at this point you kind of look around and someone is looking at you. Like now, just as they're looking now. Actually if you can get the shot of this guy that would be awesome. - [Marco] It looks good though. - Oh awesome. - [Mathieu] That's actually pretty great. (happy calming music) - Yeah like just knowing you know, I made a movie. I don't know, even just the idea that I made a movie. It's something that kind of makes me feel a bit of warmth because it's like, ah, it's something that I wanted. I remember I would watch like a Z grade movie about I don't know. Monster from Venus and whatever and it was a piece of shit and you would read, you know, the director's name and I would be like whoa, but this guy made the movie. It's a piece of shit but you know he made the movie. It's like when you're in high school and you know, then the guy that managed to have sex and it was like whoa, you know, this guy had sex. So this guy made a movie. So for me it was always like ah, I just wish you know, I could make a movie. - Is this the last...? - Actually no, because I thought about another one. - Actually! - We might do another one. - [Alejandro] Okay the one before the last scene, take one. - In many ways making movies is a bit like losing your virginity, because you really want to do it and you think you're the shit and you think you have everything figured out, but then you go there and you realize you don't know shit, and it's harder than you think and it's not as pleasant and you're gonna see a lot of blood, but the good thing is that you know, you want to make it more and more and you want to do it again so that you know, you can wash away the disappointment of the first time and that maybe eventually you're gonna become good at it, or you know, you might just be so disappointed by the first experience that you're gonna never want to do it again and retire in a convent. Alright, yeah that's good. So I guess that's a wrap. - That's a wrap, holy shit. I'm gonna cry. Let's have a group hug. - Let's have a group hug. - Hey Alejandro. Alejandro, we're finished. Come on. (all cheering) - Adios Amigos. - Next film. - Thank you very much. - It was... - It was a pleasure, Francisco. - Wonderful experience. Aww man it's over. - [Alejandro] It's over! - It's bitter sweet. (tranquil music) It's been a great experience. I mean I wouldn't trade it for anything. I was very very very lucky to land this. I mean, I was at the right place at the right time. That's all it is you know, I mean. I don't know how it's gonna turn out. It might turn out great, it might turn out poorly. It's tough because it's now out of my hands and you know, if I had it my way we'd start today. You know, today would be the first day and yeah I mean... (exasperated exhaling) What I wouldn't give to start today, you know? - These are very exciting times for film makers. It's already happening. People are just going out and making movies with no money. People that you know, 10 years ago would have never dreamed to make a feature like myself and now it's completely reasonable. It's hard, I guess it's remarkable, but it's nothing out of the ordinary. I mean, it takes determination, it takes balls. You really really really have to want to make a movie, especially if you're gonna make a movie that's not just you know, made on an iPhone with your friends. Besides, this is just the time of the revolution so are you just going to join it or are you gonna be sitting at home and wished you were part of it. Anybody can make a movie. My grandma could make a movie. I could probably teach her very quickly how to cut something together. She's not gonna make money. She's not gonna become rich or be on the cover of Time magazine, but she is gonna be able to make something. If your goal is to make movies then you should just get all the money you have. If you don't have any money, sell whatever you want. If you don't own anything, steal some money, sell your body. Find some money, you don't need a lot of it and just make something. ♫ When I was 21 ♫ It was a mediocre year ♫ It was a mediocre year ♫ For ♫ Film making directors ♫ With a low budget film ♫ We shot on the fly ♫ One of our actors almost died ♫ When I was 35 ♫ And now the days are short ♫ I'm in the autumn of the year ♫ And I think of this film ♫ As a pain in my ass ♫ That will not end ♫ That is our actor who died ♫ When I was ♫ 35 ♫ - That's your song.
