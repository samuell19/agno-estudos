usic] [gate creaks open] Ursula >> Okay. [gate clunks closed] [footsteps] Nicky, this place is freaky. Why do we have to do this tonight? Nicky >> Because it's a full moon and the witches' Guide Book to Pay Back says it has to be a full moon. And besides anything's worth knocking Heather off her diva perch, right? Ursula >> Okay, what do I do? Nicky >> Okay, you have to find a headstone with the name Wickersham written on it and light three candles. >> How are we supposed to find a headstone that says Wickersham? >> There's one over there, by that tree. >> How would you know that? >> Because my daddy's buried here. Hello. >> So right here? >> Yup. Three candles. [music] Freaky. [music] >> Ow! OW! [glass scrape] [music] [thunder] [music] [whoosh!] [screams!] [music] [Nicky laughs] Omigawd! You totally got punked! >> You suck! [laughter] >> Omigawd... You totally got punked, Urs! >> You suck. You suck, you suck, you suck, Nicky! Migawd! That's awesome. [thunder] >> You totally got punked! >> Look at you! Look at you! That's awesome. >> Isn't that good? Works like a snare. I just slipped this string through the hook when you were messing with the candles. I made it myself this morning. >> And the spell? >> Oh, the spell? Oh, really? No, you know what? Don't believe Come on, let's go. That was so worth it. Don't be a punk, Urs. It's fun. >> That was not funny at all. >> It's all fun and games. [lightning cracks] [thunder crashes] [rolling thunder] >> That guy must have pissed somebody off. [music] Nicky >> What is it? >> I don't know. A book but there's no writing on it. >> Let me see. Oh, here's some writing. "Who shall ever freely give thy soul to these pages will be requited with a power beyond their worth. Thy written word is thy bond." [music] Drippy. [music] >> What do you think it means? >> I don't know. It's a book. Who cares? >> I don't think so. I think fate put it in my hands. >> Oh yes, Ursula, the universe is w >> No, I mean, think about it. You bring me to to punk me. Lighting strikes a minister's grave out of nowhere and we find this? I mean, what are the odds? >> Maybe there's a book in every grave. Yeah, yeah, like Bibles in hotel rooms. >> No, it's special. I know it is. [music] And it's mine. [music] [school bell rings] Mr. Rogers >> If you remember what we talked about last class, a compound is defined as a chemical combination of two or more elements. The chemical bond is the glue that holds the atoms of different elements together. Now the way we're going to do that is we're going to take element One which coincidentally happens to be element One on the periodic table - hydrogen. We're going to combine that hydrogen with our second element, which is number, Eight on the periodic table. Heather >> Excuse me, Mr. Rogers. >> What is it? Hi, there! I'll talk to you two after class. Your question, Miss Gray? >> Never mind. >> Yeah, I figured as much. Okay, so if there are no other objections maybe we can make a reasonable effort to continue the experiment, yes? Hm? Shall we? >> They are like total freaks. Mr. Rogers >> Now, if we combine the hydrogen.... >> Just once...[unclear] in the ass for the world to see. >> I don't t Mr. Rogers >> In their natural states both are volatile gasses, however when combined under the right proportions and under the right conditions they bond to form a stable compound, H2O. >> Ursula! Mr. Rogers >> So, no longer are these two independent elements gasses. The electrons have formed a chemical bond and changed the gasses into a liquid solid. [music] Craig >> Do you know what he's writing his poly-sci paper on? Ursula >> What? Craig >> Why America should invade Mexico. Andrew >> Could solve the borders problem, include 100 million tax paying citizens, and virtually wipe out the national debt. Ursula >> Mmm...masochist. You know Miss Saunders is a hard core liberal. Andrew >> Yeah, that's why I think she would be open to such a radical change of policy. >> Like keeping the freaks and geeks away from the pep rally today? Of course I'm just kidding, it's a must attend for all students. >> Dead or alive, I'm sure. >> Some people just don't get high school, do they Heather? >> That's because they don't know where they belong. >> That's true. >> High school's a microcosm of life. There's the upper class, the middle class and the lower class. >> That is so true, Heather. >> It's up to those of us in the upper class to be considerate of the less fortunate with little or no future to look forward to. >> Heather, you are so giving. >> Right, well if high school's a microcosm or life then hell must play as a viable option. [smooch] [groans] Heather >> Kyle, not here. >> Why not? Everyone else is eating here. >> That's gross. >> That depends on who's eating. >> Here's an idea. Why don't you guys cream yourselves on the other side of the pit so I can keep my lunch down? >> Why don't you shut up, freak. [laughter] >> Oh, god... >> Oh-oh. Oh, it's coming. [hacking, coughing] >> Omigawd. [hacking, retching] Andrew >> Just let it go. Heather >> That is totally gross. Okay, why don't you take your freak show on the road. I'm sure the whole student body will thank you for Nicky >> Oh, don't fall. Watch yourself. Kyle >> You okay? You don't mind, do you dork? >> Oh! Kyle >> I didn't think so. >> I hate them. Nicky >> I hate them, too. Craig >> Well, you made the right call keeping your teeth over your fries. >> Wouldn't it be horrible if they dropped Heather on her head during one of those big pep rally moves? >> Yeah, I think two broken legs would be better. Body cast, muscles atrophy. Six weeks later she's hobbling around on a pair of hair covered pasty twigs. >> How can we make it happen? >> Bribe the guys who catch her. >> What do you think it'd cost me? >> Your virginity. >> Small price to pay. >> Tiny. [music] >> "Who shall ever freely give thy soul to these pages will be requited with a power beyond their world. Thy written word is thy bond." [music] >> "Dear diary. I have never tried to put my thoughts on paper before. Dominique is my best friend. I can tell her anything and I would trust her to death. I wish I was more like her. She never seems to be afraid of anything. For the most part school's okay. Although I can't stand some of the other students. The cheerleaders are the worst. They think they're better than everyone else and make it a point to humiliate anyone who doesn't fall in line with them. Her name is Heather Gray. She's pretty with a great body. But I can honestly say I hate her. I hate her more than anything else. I hate her more than anything else at school, or anywhere else for that matter. I wish she would break both of her perfect legs." [music] Nicky >> School really sucks this year, Dad. I can't wait to go to college. I don't know where I'm going to go but any place is better than here. I think Mom's more lost than I am. I can't believe she married that creep. He got laid off and she had to go back to work and now that I'm at school I just don't see her anymore. She goes to work before I get home and goes to bed about an hour before I get up. [music] >> I'm still mad at you for dying. [music] Don't worry I'll forgive you. I forgive you. [crowd noise] Heather >> Hey, look who it is, the geek sisters. >> Hey, Ursula, Nate's looking for a new girlfriend. How do you feel about wearing a paper bag over your head? [laughter] >> Don't listen to him, Ursula. They're poison. You don't have to swallow it. [music] [WHACK!] [SCREECH...!] [SQUEAL...!] [CRASH!] >> OW! OW! OW! OW! [SCREAMS...] [music] Omigawd! [music] Nicky >> I can't believe they closed school. You know, it's not like she's dead. She just broke her legs. >> I did it Nicky, I wrote in the book and it happened. >> What book? >> The diary we found. >> Look, whatever you wrote in the diary had nothing to do with Heather's accident, okay? You're just feelin I don't feel guilty at all. The truth is... I feel good. >> You feel good? >> I mean, I feel like Heather, strong and important. For the first time in my life something I said had meaning. And I don't know how, but what I wrote in that book happened. And the weird thing is I knew it would. >> Okay, so you're saying that the book broke Heather's legs? >> No, I broke her legs because I believed. >> Believed what? >> In the power of the book. >> Really? Well, can you do me a favour and ask the book to give me bigger boobs please, and Kyle Keeler, a wicked case of acne. >> You don't believe me. >> No, I don't. I don't believe you have a book that grants people wishes. >> You want proof? I'll give you proof. But I think acne's bit weak for Kyle Keeler's pretty boy face. I think we need blisters, big oozy blisters. >> Mm. >> How big? >> What? >> Your boobs, how big do you want them? >> Oh. Ohhh...not to be greedy, but, you know, I was thinking like, a full 'C'. And mention something about sh shape in there because I don't want to sacrifice perky for porky. [music] [door squeaks closed] Mom >> Hi, baby, I made a tuna noodle casserole for dinner. It's in the oven. >> I got to tell you about what happened at school today. >> I'm late for work, baby. >> It's kind of important, Mom. >> And so is my job, Nicky. If I'm not on that stage in half an hour, I'm going to lose it. >> So do the strip joints, Mom. >> I know what that's supposed to mean, but I don't have time to get mad about it. And we can talk about your school in the morning. [door squeaks closed] Frank >> You missed dinner. Your mother worries about you Dominique, and so do I. >> Well don't, Frank. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself. >> I g >> I've got to do my homework. >> Sure. That's a good idea. [footsteps] [door clatters open, closed] [music] >> So much for divine intervention. [music] >> Okay, folks, remember, this is an exam, so there will be no sharing of any results with anybody but your lab partner, okay? Now, you need to take great care with the temperatures that you're creating right now, okay? These chemicals are volatile and highly, highly corrosive. Hey! [scuffling] [crash] >> Oof! [hissing gas] >> Jackass, he deserves what he gets. >> Rogers won't fail him because he doesn't want him back next year. Trust me. >> I'm not talking about failing him. >> Oh, yeah... that's right. Well, in Well, in case you didn't notice the boob fairy didn't pay me a visit last night, Urs. >> Okay, folks, could I get one of the partners to come up and get the next element please. Nicky >> Don't worry about it. I got it. And chill on this book thing. [footsteps] >> How's Heather? >> What's it to you? >> It was a horrible accident. I feel bad for her. >> You know what? Whatever. Come on. >> Jerk. >> Well, I certainly appreciate the sentiment, Miss Davis. >> Thank you, Mr. Rogers. [music] >> Next. [music] [burble] [music] [burble] [music] >> Petooie! [CRASH] [SMASH!] Kyle >> UH! UH! UH! UH! Mr. Rogers >> MOVE! MOVE! MOVE! [screams] [CRASH!] [SMASH!] [music] >> Ursula! [music] [Ursula laughs] Nicky >> Ursula! [clatter of stretcher wheels] [Ursula's laughing] >> It's not funny. >> Yes, it is. >> No, it's not. He just burned his face. >> I wonder how much Heather wants to suck face with him now? Nicky >> What's the matter with you? Ursula >> What's the matter with you? You're the one who wanted proof. You got it. You're the one who picked him, remember? >> Picked him for what? >> To prove a point. >> Are you saying you had something to do with Kyle's accident? >> Accident? [laughs] >> You're mental, you know that? >> Okay, come on, let's go. Come on, Urs. >> Yeah, that's right. Drag your lover back to your dirty hole where you belong. >> You think you can hurt me? I can cause you more pain than you could ever imagine. >> You cause Joey and I pain just looking at you. >> I'll see what I can do to stop that. >> Okay, come on, let's go. Let's go, let's go. [music] >> What are you doing? You basically just confessed to what happened to Kyle out there! What are doing? >> So what? They can't prove anything. You saw how it happened. >> Oh... right. What's that? Oh... What's with the writing? That wasn't there before. >> I don't know. It just appeared after I started writing. Ephemeris Diaboli. It's like music. >> What are you doing? >> I'm going to write a little love note to Joey Aberra. >> No, absolutely not. >> It's mine! You don't touch it! >> Ursula, look at me. All right, this book is doing something to you. >> It's making me stronger. >> No, it's not. It's making you sick. Look at yourself. [music] >> Oh, god. >> Yeah, it's the book. It's evil. It only responds to hatred. We've got to get you help. >> No! It's my book. [footsteps] >> Urs! [music] [music] >> Diaboli. [music] Diaboli. Think Latin, think Latin, think all languages. Latin, Sanskrit. [music] Diaboli, devil... Latin translation for devil or Lucifer. [music] >> Ephemeris... diary. [music] Devil's diary... Devil's diary. [music] Devil's diary. How does it land in ambitious hands? [music] Sumeris diaboli. [music] [footsteps] >> I swear to god, Heather, his face was totally burned. >> Omigawd. Poor Kyle. >> We don't think it was an accident, do we, Lisa? >> It was Ursula Wilson. She's a witch. >> What? What are you talking about? >> She was laughing at him when they wheeled him out of the Chem Lab. >> You're kidding! >> She threatened to hurt Joey, too...tell her, Lisa. >> I heard her talking to Dominique in the bathroom. She put some kind of spell on him and was about to do the same thing to Joey when Dominique stopped her. >> Wait, what kind of spell? >> Well, they didn't say, but she has this book she used to make accidents happen. >> Omigawd. Maybe they used the book on me. >> My god, Heather. They are so jealous... >> Georgia! That thing is all that keeps me from feeling what's left of my legs. >> I'm so sorry, Heather. >> Okay, now who else knows about this book? >> Nobody, just us. >> Good. Let's keep it that way. We need a plan to get that book. Mirror. Georgia, I look like a slutty raccoon. >> Really? I think you look hot. >> Yeah, so do I. [music] Nicky >> Hello. Father Mulligan >> Mm-hum. There's no hunchback in the bell tower. I promise. Dominique, I don't think I've seen you since your mother remarried. >> Yeah well, it's been a real treat. >> It's got to be hard being a stepfather for someone who's never had their own children. >> I'd rather not talk about it, Father. >> Well, if you ever want to, know that our conversation would be confidential. What has you so concerned? [paper rustles] >> Have you seen this before? [music] >> Ephemeris Diaboli. [m [music] Can't say that I have. >> It means a diary of the devil. It was a book that was made by Satan. It was given to the pharaoh when Moses led his people out of Egypt. It's said to manifest anything evil that's written in it. >> Frightening prospect. >> Yeah, Ursula found it in the graveyard. >> Oh, that's impossible. This book would be thousands of years old. >> No, it's the same book. It's the same as the picture and she's writing stuff in it right now. Bad stuff, and it's happening. It's changing her. >> It's changing her, how? >> She's totally obsessed with the book. All she can think about is hate. >> Well, the first step would be to stop her from writing in the book. [music] >> "I hate Joey Aberra and I wish he was blind." [music] Nicky >> But she doesn't trust me anymore. >> Well, then you need to find a way to get it from her. Look, I can get us help here. There are people in the church who know about these type of things. [music] >> "I wish he'd lose his eyes." [music] Mulligan >> But as bad as it is, we can beat this. You know, good doesn't exist because we believe in God, just like evil doesn't exist because we believe in Satan. [screams!] We can fight it... with faith. Now go home and get some sleep. In the morning you do what you can to get the book from your friend. [music] [alarm clock rings] >> OH! >> Shhh... Urs! >> I thought you were my friend. >> I am. >> NO, YOU'RE NOT! You want my book. >> No, Urs, I want to help you. >> You want me dead. That's why you went to that priest for help. >> Huh? >> That's right. The book shows me everything. Even what you think! And right now it says YOU WANT TO DIE! The demons of hell want a taste of you, Dominique. You're my gift to them. [music] [wild laughter] [music] [screams] [panting] >> Ohhh... [music] Frank >> 'Morning. >> Huh...! >> Get out of my room, Frank. [footsteps] [slam!] >> Ohh! [music] [intermingled voices] Lisa >> We know what you are and what you did. Georgia >> Watch out for falling houses. >> What? What are you talking about? [footsteps] >> Did you hear what happened to Joey Aberra last night? >> No. >> They poked both of his eyeballs out. >> Omigawd! >> He was playing pool and he had this freak accident. Eddie said that one of his eyeballs actually rolled across the pool table and then went into a pocket. Can you imagine? >> I'd rather not. Have you seen Ursula at all? >> No, but she's been acting really weird lately. She's been talking to herself a lot, and laughing at stuff that's not funny. [school bell rings] Um...I' [footsteps] [pages flip] >> Oh, look here, Steve Kowalski, lover boy from junior prom. [music] You're so hot, aren't you, Steve? I have a feeling you're going to be the hottest boy in school. [music] [multi-footsteps] [bump] >> Oof! [multi-footsteps] >> Devil's diary? Nicky >> Um-hum. >> Yeah, I mean, it seems pretty out there, Dominique. >> Okay, you saw what happened with Kyle and Heather, right? Was that a freak accident? I mean she wanted something bad to happen, she wrote it in the diary. >> Yeah, but maybe she wrote them after, to pretend she has magic powers. >> Yeah, I know, but look, I saw her, okay? We talked about it before she did it. Just like with Joey Aberra, it like she wanted something bad to happen and it happened. Really, how else do you explain somebody getting their eyes poked out with a pool cue? Craig >> They were drunk? >> He just explained it. >> You know what? Forget it, forget it. See you later. Craig >> Hey, wait... >> No, it's >> No, it's fine. Effy >> Dominique, I believe you. Craig >> You always do. >> Thank you, Effy. [fire bell rings] >> Great! [fire bell rings...] [intermingled voices] Nate >> Kowalski was welding something and it just burst into flames. Georgia >> Omigawd! How? Nate >> It all happened so fast. All I remember is Kowalski was using the arc welder. I heard a loud crackle, pulled off my mask. All I saw was a flash of light that swallowed him up. Next thing I know he was on fire. It was sick. The weird thing was, I had just finished telling him about Joey, like a minut I know there's something... off about this school. It ain't natural. [music] >> All right, tell us again about this book and what you think it can do. [music] >> Thanks for coming, Father Sanchez. >> Time is not a luxury we have if Ephemeris Diaboli has truly been unearthed. Have you seen it? >> A young woman has it. Apparently she's already begun writing in it. >> Then we have no time. The book has started spreading it's evil and will soo into the hands of one with more ambition. [music] Georgia >> Oh, my god. Is this it? All right. >> Okay, so what's the plan? >> You go in and get the book. >> That's your plan? You guys nuts? >> You saw what she did to Heather, to Kyle and Joey. >> Kyle would do it for you. You know he would. >> I'll tell you what. You go in and get the book, and maybe... I'll give you a little... bonus. >> Are you in, too? >> Don't be gross, Nate. >> Just get the book, okay? [music] He's going around the back. [music] [dialing beeps] [phone rings] Hello. Nate >> It looks like she's doing a spell right now. >> How do you know? >> Because there's candles and crap all over the bedroom. Okay, I'm ready. >> It's go time. [music] Georgia >> Remember we have to stall her until Nate gets out of there. >> And how do we do that? >> Lisa, please, we're cheerleaders. [ding-dong] [phone rings] >> Hello? Nate >> She's not moving. Ring the door again. [ding-dong] Yeah, she's ignoring the door. Bang on the door and make some noise. [bam, bam, bam...] All right. [music] Okay, okay. Here, she's coming. [music] Oof... [grunts] [music] [door clicks open] Georgia >> Hi, Ursula. You look good. >> What do you want? [music] We just wanted to apologize for the way we treated you the other day. >> No, you don't. >> Yes, we do. Don't we, Lisa? >> Yeah, we were so rude and stuff. [music] >> I'm the lower class, remember? Let's keep it simple. I hate you, you hate me. >> No, no, we want to be friends, all of us... me and Lisa, Heather. >> Heather? >> Yeah, it was her idea to come and see you. >> Don't you ever say her name! >> What are you doing? >> Do you have any idea how close you are to dying? You just made the top of my list you stupid whore! [music] [glass smashes] >> Let go of me! [music] >> Now who's dead you stupid bitch! >> NO! NO! [music] [footsteps] >> All right, we did it, Lisa! Nate >> We? I had to jump through a window! >> Oh, don't worry, I'd do a lot more than tha >> That's what I'm talking about. >> We got the wrong book! >> What? >> The pages are all blank. >> Not a chance, you saw it. She was treating that thing like it was the burning bush. >> Omigawd, Lisa's right! They're blank. They're all blank. >> That is the book. You saw how crazy she went when we took it, right? >> There's nothing in it. >> Maybe only witches can read it, I don't know. >> Like under a special light or something? >> Her lights were off. She had candles everywhere. >> If you're right, Heather's going to kill me. [intermingled voices] [footsteps] >> What's the matter? >> Maybe we should keep it. >> What are you talking about? We have to give it to Heather. >> Why? We could just tell her that we never found it. We could say that we went there, but there was no book. >> What happens when she talks to Nate? >> Nate won't be a problem. Once I give him what he wants he'll say anything I tell him to. We could just tell Heather that he got the wrong book and there was no way we could get back inside. >> Georgia, my god, would you listen to yourself? We're not going to lie to Heather. Now, come on. [music] [whoosh, crack of thunder] [footsteps] [rustle of flipping pages] >> So how does it work? Georgia >> I think you write in it. >> Then where's the writing? Where's the stuff she wrote about me and Kyle? Georgia >> I don't know. [sound of approaching car] Andrew >> Five hundred bucks. Craig >> Shut up. I knew all about it. >> Hey! Ursula's Mom gets home by five, so no stopping for eats, okay? [flapping pages] >> Maybe she tore the pages out. >> There's no pages missing. Either this is the wrong book or you guys got totally punked. >> We haven't got punked, Heather, this is the right book. I can feel it. >> You can feel it, can you? Nicky >> I'm going over now. I'll see you guys there. >> What's the matter? You don't like my car? >> >> No. [laughs] A little tact was in order there, no? >> Oh, that was tact for Dominique. >> You know what? I like it. It reminds me of those old movies where nobody ever had sex. >> Right. Let's go. >> Okay, you write. I'll dictate. "Ursula Wilson is an ugly tramp who deserves to lose all of her teeth, all of her hair and choke on her own vomit." >> That is totally gross, Heather. >> Thank you. [music] [knock, knock, knock] >> Urs! [music] [door clatters open] Urs! Urs? Ursula, it's me, Dom. Hey, hi. [knock, knock] It's me, Dom. >> Oh... [sobs] What? Hello? [snap, snap] Hey, what's going on? >> I just feel sick. [sobs] [music] They ruined it. They ruined it. >> Omigawd. >> They ruined it. [music] [heaving sounds] [choking sounds] >> Okay, we've got to get you to the bathroom. [retches] Let's go, let's go. Okay... Okay, come on, let's go. Let's go. [retching] [knock, knock, knock] That's Andy. I'll be right back. >> Dominique! [footsteps] >> Finally. >> Hi, Okay... I need you to call 911! >> Oh wait, what's happened? >> Someone's taken the diary and they're using it to hurt Ursula, I think. [violent vomiting] >> Okay...I can't do this. Hey, hey! >> Really? You can't stay and help a friend? >> This is scary stuff, okay? Listen to her! >> Yeah, I know, it's scary, isn't it Craig? Listen, to her. She's sick in there and may be dying. I think she needs our help. >> How am I supposed to help her, okay? If you're right about th of getting hurt even worse! >> Hey, let's just calm down! [door squeaks] Okay, where is the book now? >> There's no doubt in my mind either Heather or Georgia has it. [door slams] [footsteps] Effy >> The ambulance is on its way. Nicky >> Urs? [rattle, rattle] Andrew >> Open it up! [knock, knock, knock] [retching] >> Urs! Urs! Ursula... Wha...? Ursula, come on, open the door! [grunts...] What is that? Urs! [whoosh] What's that noise? [bam, bam, bam] [SCREAMS] >> Oh, stop that! URS! [SCREAMS] [intense music] Oh, gawd, what is it? [SCREAMS] URS! Andrew >> Open it! >> Come on! [music] [slow measured footsteps] [door squeaks open] [SCREAMS] >> Urs... Oh, gawd, No! No! Ursula! No! Come on. What is going on? Urs! Urs! [music] Nicky >> It was horrible. She didn't even look like Ursula. Sanchez >> The evil of the book consumed. To write in it is a pact with Satan for your soul. Mulligan >> Do you know who has the book now? >> I think I do, um... classmates, girls that aren't very nice. >> Ephemeris Diaboli will always move into more ambitious hands. It is the way of evil. It is the way evil works in this world. >> Okay, how do we destroy it? Sanchez >> It cannot be destroyed any more than man can destroy evil itself. >> So if people are getting hurt, do you not think we should call the police? >> This is a battle for souls, child. The laws of man are blind to such things. >> So what are we going to do? >> You must bring the bo >> Oh, forget it, forget it. It's not happening. Mulligan >> Do you understand how important it is you bring the book back here, Dominique? >> No, do you understand that these kids don't like me. I could end up worse than Ursula without even saying another word to them. >> You're scared. >> Yeah. I'm scared. [sobs] I came here because I don't know what to do. I don't what to do. I'm not even religious. I'm sorry, Father. >> Did you hold it? >> Yeah...no, yes. >> Was there any desire to keep it? >> Not like Urs. I mean she was hot for it the moment she picked it up. >> Hot for it? >> Yeah, she was, you know, she was into it. She was weird from the day she got the book. >> Absolute power corrupts the mind and the soul. The diary offers absolute power to do only evil things. Even those with soundest, the strongest of faith would be hard pressed not to give in to the temptation of the power that it puts in their hands. >> So what happens if you write in the book? >> You're given a choice, Dominique. They can walk away, or they can give in to the power of the book. You see ignorance does not condemn your soul to damnation. Acceptance of your actions does. You make a choice to decide what the book has to offer and your soul is lost. Look at me, child. Do you understand the difference between good and evil? >> I think I do. >> So does Ephemeris Diaboli. It must be looked upon as a living thing with all the power of hell. [music] [phone rings] >> It's her answering machine again. >> Try her cell. >> I tried her cell. She's obviously avoiding me. >> Georgia wouldn't do that. She worships the ground you walk on. [beep] [phone rings] >> Hello. >> Thanks for answering. I feel honored. >> What do you want, Heather? >> Excuse me? What do I want? You could start with a little respect. Last time I looked, I was still head cheerleader. >> I know that, Heather. I'm just really busy. My Mom is completely on my back about my term paper. >> Whatever. Guess who just walked in here? Lisa and Nate. And guess what piece of news they carried with them? >> I don't know. >> Ursula Wilson had an accident this afternoon, just like you wrote in that book. >> Are you sure? >> Would I be calling you if I wasn't sure? Now I need you to do two things immediately. One is write the following in that book. "I want Heather Gray to have a miraculous recovery and be healed by morning." >> Heather... >> And second, is get your ass over here like yesterday with that book so we can take care of some real business. Georgia, are you listening to me? I'm not kidding. Oh...! [beep] That tramp just hung up on me. >> Georgia wouldn't do that. >> Excuse me. I think I know when a tramp hangs up on me. >> I'm not surprised. She said she'd have sex with me if I helped her. >> Nate! It's hardly the same thing. You're a tackle. I'm the captain of the hottest squad in the state. Dial her again, Lisa. [dialing beeps] [phone rings] >> "I want Heather Gray to have a tragic accident." [music] [music] [snarling roar] [music] >> "I want a body to kill for, and every boy who sees me to want me desperately." [music] >> It's not that complicated. We have to get the book. >> What, the same book that killed Ursula? >> It's not a gun. She has to write what she wants to happen for it to happen. >> Yeah, that's the problem. What if she's already written something about us in it like, if we attack her, we die? >> Because it doesn't work like that. >> How do you know how it works? >> Because I saw what it did to Ursula. Look... We're not alone in this. I mean Father Mulligan found a priest who knows all about the book. He's been searching for it for years. >> Then why don't they do something? >> Well, they will. We have to give them the book, Andrew. Now listen to me. I kn to wrap your head around, but I can't do this without you. >> Uh...Well, what's your plan? >> To provoke Georgia into writing in the book and then stopping her before she does. >> That's suicide. >> Pretty much, if we don't get the book. Well, you wanted to kiss me, didn't you? >> For about two years. So what makes you think that she'll have it with her? >> Basic understanding of human nature. [music] >> Georgia, what's going on? >> What's it look like? They're fighting over me. >> What? >> They love me, Lisa, they just want to be close to me. >> Did you write this in the book? >> You're just jealous. You've always been jealous of me. >> What are you talking about? >> You and Heather both. Well, guess what? It's my time now. >> They're killing each other and you're just laughing. >> So what? They're just stupid guys. >> You did this! You wrote something in that book to make guys fight over you, didn't you? >> It's not what I meant to happen. >> You have to stop it, Georgia. >> I don't have to stop anything. Do you understand that? I ca And you better get on board with that, Lisa, before you lose your head. [music] [multi-footsteps] >> Yeah, I don't know why I want it really... Lisa >> Dominique! Dominique! Dominique, please! It's about the book. Georgia's been writing in it. We have to stop her. [music] >> Okay, we can't lose sight of her, all right? Not even for a moment. >> Dom, are you sure you want to do this? I mean if she writes something in that book... >> Don't let her. Please, don't let her. [music] >> You took that book from Ursula and I want it back. >> The first one who runs around the entire school three times gets to buy me lunch. How did I forget about you? >> I don't know. I guess it's easy to forget about the lower class. >> Oh, so true. [music] >> You used that book to kill Ursula. >> Sorry. I know how close you two were. But I'll tell what I'll do to make it up to you. >> What's that? >> I'll hook you up with every boy in the school. Would you like that? >> You're one sick psychopath. >> Maybe, but you're going to be one very popular freak because I'm writing an invitation. [music] Craig >> Is it just me or does Georgia look really...? >> Hot? >> Yes! I never realized her ass was so... >> Bulbous. >> Yes. >> Excuse me. We can hear you. >> So? Tell me she's not hot, Effy. >> Since when do you find slutty hot? >> Oh, since her body went Playboy. >> It's an illusion. She's using the book to make herself look good. >> Yeah, well, it's working. >> Come on, I know where she's going. [music] >> Okay, you guys wait here in case she gets by me. >> Wait, I'm going with you. No offense, but Dominique's been our friend a lot longer than j >> Whatever. [music] >> Lisa, wait! How do you know Georgia's even back here? >> Heather and Georgia come back here when they want to hide out or party during school. [music] [door clicks open] [footsteps] >> I have a strange feeling you're following me Lisa. >> What are you writing? >> The deep dark secrets of my soul. [music] Are you scared? >> Should I be? >> Yes. You're a threat, Lisa. I can't trust you to keep your head. >> Oof! [music] [bashes, grunts of struggle] [panting] >> Grab the book! [music] [WHAP!] [music] >> Listen to me, you stupid little bitch. I will kill you with my bare hands if you don't give me my book. Lisa >> She'll kill you anyway, Effy. >> Effy? Are you running with a new crowd now, Lisa? >> Oh, I'm not running from you, Georgia. That book is evil. [music] [whap!] OHH...! [music] [crash!] [zzzzzzzssst!] [music] [SCREAM!] [music] >> Hi. >> Ugh...! [choking sounds] >> I don't need that book to kill you. >> Oh, I think you do. [music] >> Okay, Andy, stop her, okay? [music] Andrew >> You're not getting out of here, Georgia. >> Hi, boys. You know what really turns me on? Two guys making out. [footsteps] >> Don't say a word. >> Mm-hummm... [running footsteps] [music] >> It's too late for you, whore. [music] Run and hide, just like a scared little rat. [music] You moron! You're not smart enough to have that book. It belongs to me. Nicky >> The book doesn't respond to smart, Georgia. It wants evil. >> It wants me. Andrew >> Hey, sorry, Dominique! She tricked us! >> Go back inside. Go on back inside. >> What? Georgia >> Don't leave me, guys. I may need some help here. >> Yeah, you heard her, Craig. You should go wait inside. >> You wait inside. >> Oh. >> What do you want, Georgia? >> That bitch has my book and whoever gets it for me gets me. Craig >> Give me the book, Dominique. Andrew >> No, you know you can't trust Craig, give it to me. Okay, okay, come here. Georgia >> No, wait, wait! I have a better idea. I'm, uh...working on this new cheer, and if you can help me out with it, I'll show you why I'm best head cheerleader. >> Sure. Beorgia >> All right. Give me a 'K', give me an 'I', give me an 'L', give me an 'L'. What's that spell? Andrew >> Kill. Craig >> Kill. >> Kill. Kill. >> No, no no no no. >> Come on, Dominique. I want it. Hey, hey, babe. >> Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay... Okay, no... >> It's me. [rip] Here. [rip] It's me, Dominique. [rip] [music] Here, Dominique. It's me. [music] Come on. Come here. Georgia >> Uhhh... Ohh... Andrew >> Dominique. [music] [WHAP!] [THUD!] >> OH...! [frightened panting] [music] Frank >> Ditching school are you? >> I got excused. >> Excused, for what? >> I have got a fever. I'm not feeling well. >> Hot are you, like your mother? >> Get out of my room, Frank. >> I think I should take care of you, put you to bed. That's what your mommy would want. >> Get out of my room. >> What have you got there, huh? You're not reading something you shouldn't, are you? >> That's a book I need for school. >> Oh, yeah? >> Give it to me, Frank. >> This is to write in. [music] >> Frank... I think you're right, Frank. >> About what? >> About putting me to bed. >> Oh, yeah? >> Yeah. >> Yea You should... You should get [music] >> No, please stop it! >> Argghh! [music] >> Where are my keys? >> All right... You're not going anywhere. [music] [CRASH] >> Ooomph! [SLAM!] [bash! bash! bash!] [grunts of effort] >> Open this door, you hear me? Open this damn door, you little, tramp! [bam, bam, bam...] Open this door! [bam, bam, bam...] Open the door now, you little whore. Come on, Dominique! Open this door! >> "I wish Frank were dead." "Die! Die! Die!" >> Open this door right now! [music] >> Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay... [music] >> Ulgghh... Ughhh... [last gasps] [music] [sobs] [music] [footsteps] [footsteps] [door clangs open] >> Dominique. >> What do you imagine hell is like? >> My view of hell is much like my view of heaven. It's different for everyone. I see you found the diary. Your face tells me it came at a price. >> I wrote it. I killed my stepfather. Take it. >> I can't. >> Take it from me. >> I can't. >> Just take it. >> No, I cannot! >> Take it. It's talking to me. It's telling me things I think about. Take it! Take it! >> No, I can't! >> It's talking to me. >> We have to have help, okay? I'm going to take you inside to see Father Sanchez, okay? He's going to help. Right now, inside... >> No, no, no, no, no. I can't go in there. I can't go in there. Not now, I can't go in there. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. My Father would know. He was always right. Even when I knew he was wrong. >> Look, I'm going I'm going to go inside and get Father Sanchez. >> Okay. >> Wait here. [church door clangs] [music] >> Father Sanchez, Dominique is outside and she has the book with her. [music] [gate squeaks open] [clangs shut] [music] Mulligan >> Dominique! Dominique! [music] [gate squeaks open] [music] Nicky >> Will you help me? Dad? Help me. I don't want to give him the book. I don't want to give him the book, Dad. [music] Mulligan >> Dominique, Dominique. Sanchez >> Ephemeris Diaboli. Mulligan >> Father Sanchez has dedicated his life to finding the truth behind the book, Dominique. He knows what to do with the book. >> No. He wants the book. >> The book speaks to you, doesn't it, my child? It's okay that you've written in the book, Dominique. >> You need to give Father Sanchez the book. >> I can't give him the book. He wants the book. I can feel it. Look at his hands. >> There's nothing wrong with his hands. >> Look at his hands, Look at his hands. Look! Mulligan >> There's nothing wrong with his hands. You need to give him the book. >> Don't give him the book! >> Now, stop! >> No! No! No! No! >> That book, it's taken her mind. Nicky >> DON'T! [music] Mulligan >> You just need to try and calm down, okay? Father Sanchez has the book. He knows what to do with it. It's going to be fine. >> No. Father Sanchez wants Everybody who touches the Even me. As soon as he put his hands on it I could feel it. Only... It chose him. It chose him because he's more ambitious. >> Are you sure the book chose him? >> Yes, with every bone in my body. >> I need you to go home as fast as you can and wait for me there, okay? >> And do what? >> Pray, God be with us. Pray! >> Okay. [music] [rolling thunder] [music] Sanchez >> A remarkable girl to walk away from such power. >> Did she walk away? Or did the book find its way into the hands of someone with more ambition? >> Ambition and understanding. Understanding how to use power is essential to keeping it. Ephemeris diaboli is a conduit to hell itself. Once a deal is struck, there is no need to write. >> You've lost your soul to the devil. >> Not lost, given... long before I found this. [screams] [cries of agony] Sanchez >> Earthquakes, famine, disease, I have the power to wield anything. [music] [cries of agony] [cries of agony] [evil laughter] [Sanchez speaks in Latin] [music] Dominique! [SCREAM] I knew you'd come back. He got what he wanted. He's proving his undying faith for his God. What do you want, my child? The power you felt when you killed your stepfather? >> No! >> I think you do! >> NO! NO, I DON'T! >> You knew what you were doing. You know its power. Join me, Dominique. Give your soul to the diary and become immortal. >> Let him go. >> He made his choice. >> Let him go and I'll join you! I will! [music] I'm sorry. >> You've kept the faith. Don't lose it now. [Sanchez speaks in Latin] This graveyard is my gateway to hell. I can feel your hatred for me. It fuels your deception. >> Oh...! Striking me with loathing would consummate our union. [music] [crash of thunder] >> You're free to move... Dominique. [music] Strike me with all the hatred in your heart. Strike me, Dominique. Look at me. Join me. [music] Strike me, Dominique! Strike me! >> NO....! [crash of thunder] >> ARGGHHHH.... [music] [footsteps] Mom >> Hi baby. >> Hi. >> Dr. Knowles says you're doing great. [silence] So I thought that we could bring you home soon. I got a new job at the Hall Mart I'm not stripping anymore. Listen, baby, if I'm going to get you out of here, you've got to stop talking about the book, okay? You understand? >> Ephemeris diaboli? >> What did you say? >> You should know by now. Ephemeris diaboli. [music] >> This is not a joke, Nicky. They could keep you here until hell freezes over and there is nothing I could do about it. Did you forget that they've got a dead per sign next to you? >> THE BOOK, MOM! IT'S THE BOOK! Okay? It killed the kids at school, and it killed Father Mulligan. It tried to seduce me... >> STOP IT! Stop talking like that right now! Do you want to spend the rest of your life in here? Is that what you want? [music] [babble of voices] [crash of thunder] [running footsteps] [scrape, scrape...] [music] [ripple of pages] [zap! zap!] [music] >> It's alive again. [scream...!]
