Don't go tripping. It'll kick in an hour. - You're up for dancing and stuff… - I got stung by a bee! Listen, I got stung by a bee!

You did well yesterday, but I need to talk to my bro. You help us, we help you. So, will you help us? I will, but I still need to clean. Later. Careful with that. - Someone is waiting for us. - Who?

What? - Trust me, bro. - How am I... - Let's fuck this system! - How am I… This is nonsense. Fuck poverty! Nice. A businessman playing politics will give another one a huge bribe. There'll be around five million in his briefcase. It'll be chained to his wrist. You'll drive away in the stolen car that we'll provide you. We'll split the money into five parts. Any questions? Five parts? - And there will be no security? - You've got my word. - Five million? - Do you have guns? Sure. Brilliant. They're old, not used in a long time. Take this one.

The doctor had a few yesterday. - But I can see how bad you look. - And? And… Every Friday, we hold meetings here. They helped me back in a day. It's kind of therapy. - You got it wrong. - Think about it. Sure. - And? - It's broken. - What?! - I won't be taking the finals. No way! Ouch, you idiot! - Stinks like death. - Catch. Excuse me. Is this your phone? You left it in the office. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Take this bag off me. Holy fuck! What a ride! They picked us up with this one. You said you liked it. Did you think they'd steal another one? Well, V8 engine, 300 horsepower. That's what I fucking need. It must be 20 years old. So fucking what? At worst, we won't get there. We agreed on something. A small line never killed anybody. Drive. Chill, bro. We want to steal something using a stolen car. - Don't shit yourself. - Don't touch me. You're a dickhead. Focus on the road, Wajcha. On the toad? Yeah. Just chill, dude. What got you so paranoid? Drugs? I'm already planning how I'm gonna spend my money. - Why are you laughing? - What you gonna get?

Over here, you idiot. Don't do anything. We're leaving. - It's over. - "Don't shoot"? Five million! - No, don't... - You acted like a student! - Wrong way, turn right. - It was one way. It was a shortcut. You know what that is? - Don't shit yourself. - Turn right. We're fucked because you had to get high and act like an owl. That's great. Well done. I can't believe it! You look like an ancestor of owl and toucan. You're a fucking toucanowl. We did it, man! Bang-bang! On the ground, bitches! Did you have be rough with the waitress? Why are you laughing? We're the Knights of the Round Table and you told her to shut up. - What was I supposed to say? - What to say... - "Could you please shut up?" - We're the Knights of the Round Table. Who? Knights of the Round Table. Didn't you know? You acted like a redneck. Knights don't say that... What do the knights say? "My Lady, please lie on the ground"? - You should have said that. - Tell me what was I supposed to say. "Excuse me ma'am, please lie on the ground." Exactly. - You know how that sounds? - How? - Very gangsta. - My intention. Gangsta Knight of the Round Table. You acted like a peasant with a pitchfork. - I'm Lancelot, get that? - Yeah, right. - Lancelot. - Would Lancelot speak like that? - He always spoke like that. - Like what? "Shut it"? - I said "shut up." - He'd add, "princess." The lady-killer lives here. So? - It doesn't interest you? - It's not our case. Unfortunately. - You'd rather chase losers? - Someone has to. - I know him. It's Chada! - Cops! Go! Faster! Holy shit! Go. Relax. A green jaguar... Can't you see it's brown? Not gray? Khaki, I don't know. An olive Jaguar. We've got him, kiddo. Another cop car. Plan B, Wajcha. Speed up! Get him! Block the exit to Gdańsk on the bypass. Faster! - Fucking car. - Relax, mom. Speed up. Turn right. We'll lose them. Two on the right. Take the gravel road. To the forest. Did we lose them? Follow them! We're gonna get them. Happy now? A boar! Slow down. - Everything is fine. - Stop talking. - Just go. - Can you feel your legs? - No. - What? Just kidding. Come on. Come on. Wake up. Can you hear me? Let's go. We are. We'll close the door and go. Hands on your heads! Step out of the car, shitheads! Out, young lady. You're the true Lancelot now. Hold this. Thieves! What happened? I slipped. Your stepdad will be pissed. - You'll ruin our lives. - You're crazy? Dad has problems, he needs our support or everything will be fucked! - Hi. - Inspector Jaskółka and Federowicz. We've some questions. - Sure. - I'm sorry. Shoot. Okay. Have you noticed… Sir, have you noticed anything specific that could lead us to the offenders? No, it happened so fast. Do you recognize this man? They had balaclavas on. In this country, when you earn your success with hard work, others will bring you back down. Right. - They took your briefcase. - Correct. From what I know, it says so in my notes, you didn't report that. So, here's my question. What was inside? Company's documents, wallet, credit cards… Who the hell is this guy, Aneta? Here's the thing. Why anyone would go to such an extent to steal a briefcase that is chained to the wrist? Call your boss. You're boring me. Seriously? It doesn't work like that anymore. They knew perfectly well what was in the briefcase. Let me ask again: what was inside? Go fuck yourself. You're boring me. - Take him away, Aneta. - I'm sorry. He's young and ambitious. Wants to solve that case badly. How much do you make? It isn't worth it. It isn't worth it regardless. Just one more question. Where will I find your bodyguards? Doctor! I feel weak. I'm sorry, Kazimierz. I'll make it up to you. Is everything okay? What the fuck are you doing? That was questioning? Showing your emotions is not professional. - Who hired you? - You know him? You don't? He has the biggest ophthalmic clinic in Poland. You don't know him? He deals with the National Health Fund. The Internal Security Agency is involved and we don't need any... You don't find it weird at all? How did a petty thief get involved? They found a scapegoat. We need to talk to Chudy. You've lost your mind. Forget about it. Hang in there. Help me, Wajcha. Three, two, one. Where are the keys? Can you hear me? The keys! I hope grandma doesn't come back. Don't fall asleep. Wajcha. Come over here. Take this. On the upper gum. - Phone. - What? Marta's number is in the kitchen. - Somewhere between the bottles. - It's a bad idea. Get it. For fuck's sake. This one? Give it to me. Hey. Come... Come here. To grandma's. I can't. Look at the dough. Wajcha. Wajcha? Hey. Wajcha. Fuck! I need a rest. I haven't seen him. MAY 1, 2014 - You're here? - Why so late? Jesus. Listen. - Oh my God. - He'll be fine. A bee stung him. It must have been quite a bee. Okay. The bullet went through. He's lost a lot of blood. Leave. I thought you were not gonna wake up. Stop it. I wouldn't dare to. I'm sorry. Let me listen to the young lion. Thanks. Shall we name him Oskar? Fuck! I'm dying, Marta. No, you're not. - How are you? - Better. Don't tell her. Maybe I should know what you two got yourselves into. Oskar. What's up? Thanks for not leaving me. All by myself. In the forest. Don't call me Oskar. You never leave your bro behind. You came back for me once. Remember that, Marta? Thanks. Of course she does. We're even. My love. You want something from the shop? No, thanks. I'll make you dinner. - Oh, boy… - Leave him alone. I'm the one who put us in trouble. Police are looking for two men suspected of armed robbery in the restaurant near town. One of them… May I? …is a skinny male, Yeah.

You were the perfect choice. I see. I see. We got a call that you harass women in this area. - Women? - By wearing that coat. - What? - Well… It's unbuttoned, you can see nothing. Maybe, but they're scared. - They have a reason. - I don't know… You're drooling all over them. - Yes. - Yes? Hi, Krime. And now what? I'll be gentle. We're not gonna make a scene. What now, bitch?

Since you crossed my path everything is different. For once in my life I want to… do something… Something good? Exactly. Something good. Something really good. You already did. My home. You've done a lot of bad things, but my life wasn't perfect either. Let's run away where no one can find us. Okay. Let's do that tomorrow. I wanna stay here a bit longer.

Me? - You. - I do. - Come with me. - I've never done it before. - It's high time. - I've been working on this for two years. If you have to. Might be nasty. I'll take another gun. We've got him. Nowakowski Oskar. Raised in an orphanage. Convicted of theft twice. Clean for five years. Mother unknown. Father died in a car accident. Carry me! Look, jellyfish. I've read about this. The robbery and your disappearance… It's not a coincidence. Maybe. The guy who you robbed… is not my dad. Really? You know I'm an orphan? The only memory I have of my parents… is this place, this beach. Don't you fucking move! - You'll scare her. - On the ground. Hands on your head. Easy, Aneta. They're not armed. Stay out of it. You wanted to come? Shoot him or I'll do it. What are you staring at? I remember you. I remember. Are you fucking insane? It's not Wild Wild West! Talk, Chudy! You've got a great partner. - You like killing girls. - Shut up! I remember you dragging her to the van. Are you fucking mad?! I'm not done with you yet. Come here, cocksucker. I'll blow your fucking head off. You put your make-up on. You make faces. You take selfies in your underwear. And it never occurs to you that you're hurting people. A little birdie has escaped. Why are you doing this? You know how it feels to have a kid taken away? Do you? When you're hugging your son… Your sweet little baby with blond curls… who you love the most in the world. And he takes him away, saying that you're too young to raise him, because you're only 16 years old. And then disappears with some slut from the disco. That's why I'm doing that. Oskar has the same mark. Oskar. Look at me. It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. Subtitle translation by: Sylwester Stachowicz
