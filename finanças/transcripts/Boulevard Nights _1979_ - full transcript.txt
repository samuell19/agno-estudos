[speaking in Spanish] The car. What color? It was red. It had a lot of primer on it. One of the doors in the front was all primer. The driver side? No, the other side. I remember seeing that car. It's a 52 or a 53 Chevy. Simon. Gang bang car. What about the insignia? Did you see that? Man, I hardly saw the fuckin' car. Want to see the beach? For what? - 'Where'd it come from?' - What're you worrying about? They're all clean. That's too light, Chuco. 'Take the 38.' Here. Hey, what are you doin'? Hey, you see barrio gets barrio,man.

And we're gonna get enough puertes to come down on all those dudes from 11th Street. Let's go. Raymond? Where have you been?

Here. I don't want the keys. What's this going to prove? Okay. Do what you want then. Raymond. Stay out of it, Shady. Hey, I'm your family too, you know. [sighs] You ever fire a Magnum before? Okay. Take this one. You gotta promise me something. You gotta keep control. Just the dudes who did it. Okay? We have to find the car with the primer door first. I don't know the houses, so you drive. You know where we wanna go? [door bell ringing] Stay here. Go to the back of the house and stay there. Go on. [Gil] 'What's the matter? It's me, Gil.' - How you doin'? - Fine. Thank you.

The police come up with anything? Any leads? No, no leads. Well, you will let me know if anything happens, huh? Yeah. Sure, I'll let you know. Good enough. I'll talk to you later. Thanks for coming, Gil. [Gil] 'Bye.' [sighs] It's almost down now. No. It's gotta be black. [jazz music] Please wait. Let the police find out who did it. The police don't care. [Shady] 'But I care.' [Raymond] 'Shady, please.' [Shady] 'I care about us.' Raymond. - Raymond, what is going on? - I don't know. I don't believe this, Raymond. You're going to go out there-- - I don't want to hear it. - You're no different. - I don't want to hear it. - Can we talk about this? Please, Raymond. I'm not walking away from this. Raymond, please wait. Please. Please. Raymond, please. Don't do this. Hey, go inside and lock the door.
