ROLLiT Morning. - Morning. - All set? Yes. See you. - Take care. - I will. Bye. - See you. - Yes. Bye. Bye, Dad. Can you manage without me? Yes. Call if you need anything. Did you remember everything? Yes. - Bye. - Wait. I have something for you. - Thanks! - Buy some pizza or something. - See you. I'll call you. - Bye, dear! Bye. - Would like some lunch, Kjeld? - That would be lovely. - I'll be in the garden. - Sure thing. No, Kjeld. Don't let yourself in. Ring the bell. - Hello? - Hi, dear. It's us. Esben? You can have the red couch if you like. Thanks, but no thanks. - It would look so nice over there ... - I don't want it! - We have to watch what we say. - It would look so nice over there. - I wouldn't mind living here. - Right. - This is Sandra. - Hi. My name is Vibeke. - Hi. Sandra. - Hi. I'm Kjeld. - Do you mind if we do our own thing? - Don't you want me to finish drilling? Sure, but ... - We don't mind. - Of course not. Thanks. - Nice to meet you. - You too. Sweetheart? Maybe we should move to something smaller. - What about the house? - We don't need all this space now. We could find an apartment in town. - This is Esben's childhood home. - Yes. - He'd be upset if we sold it. - He doesn't live here anymore. - No, but he'll still come to visit. - Of course he will. - I couldn't live without the garden. - Right. But we could look around. Hi. Welcome. Let's take a look. - It's for your child? - Yes. You'll be pleased. The apartment used to be an old shithole. But now it's a very attractive student apartment - - in the heart of Copenhagen. - Do you have a son or daughter? - Son. It doesn't get much better than this. From the hallway you have access to all the rooms. Here is the living room-cum-bedroom with a chimney, visible beams - - a nice wood floor and lots of sunlight in the morning. There's plenty of room for a sofa, dining table or desk. There's an alcove with French windows. It's very sexy. Out here is a brand-new kitchen with new appliances. There's room for a nice breakfast nook. And now for the icing on the cake: A lovely renovated bathroom with a separate shower, light tiles - - and a modern toilet with dual flush. - It doesn't get much better than this. - Can I take a look around on my own? - By all means. - Thanks. KJELD AND VIBEKE'S THIRD ANNIVERSARY - How about a Corona with dinner? - Yes, if you two are having one. Hi, dear. Are you on your way? Mom and I have made tacos and everything. Oh, okay. No, I understand. It's fine. I'll bring your laundry over on my way to work tomorrow. Yes. Okay. Bye. - Isn't he coming? - No. I guess he had another date. What is it? Nothing. What's the matter? I don't really know what's the matter with me. I just miss him terribly. I don't know what we should do now. - What's this? - Do you recognize it? It's a surprise. Hi. - What's going on? - Who knows? - Welcome. - Thank you. Hi. You brought your wife. A wise move. Let's take a look at it. - The place looks awesome now. - Yes. French windows and everything. And you can see the ridge beams. It's fantastic! - Do you remember all the fun we had? - Yes. We spent some good years there despite it being a dump. - Those were good times. - Yes. But it's a bit on the small side, Kjeld. It depends on how much space you need. We would be closer to Esben. He'd love to come over. We have to make up our minds. It's cheap, so it'll sell quickly. Esben? Esben? Esben! What? Remember we told you about the apartment we had before we had you? Nope. We've decided to move back into it. What about the house? We'll sell it. How would you feel about that? How big is the apartment? - About 55 square meters. - Maybe a bit more. - That's smaller than mine. - Yes. A little. - We don't need much space now. - It's a lovely apartment. It's been renovated and it has visible beams and a new bathroom. It's very nice. It's only a seven-minute walk from your place. Okay. We could put the chairs here. No, that's where the bed will go. What if we put the chairs here and the bed over here? No, we agreed that the couch would go there. - I can't find them. - It doesn't matter. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Vibe? Come and take a look. - Do you remember this? - God, yes. - It hung here. - It's fun to see it again. - We had our stereo here. - And listened to tons of records. We did. - Where did you find it? - In a box we had in the basement. - The door was open. - Hi, dear! - So this is where you'll live? - Yes. Hi. - Good to see you. - We haven't unpacked everything yet. It'll be nice. I brought some laundry. Is that okay? - I'll do it. Do you want a beer? - No, I have to head out. - Not at this hour. - Sandra is waiting for me. Downstairs? Bring her up. We'll have a beer. - Or a quick cup of coffee. - I have to go. Come on, Esben. Where's the fire? - It's fine. - See you later. - We want to hear how you're doing. - I'll be back. Bye. Do you remember those two? - Look. Elton John. - Yes. In his leaner days. Oh my God. We listened to this all the time. - It's 25 years ago. - At least. - I loved this record. - Put it on. - Does it work? - Sure. - Would you like some coffee? - Please. - No, don't! - But you like it. - No, I don't! - Oh, Kjeld! - What are you doing? - Just a little more. No! - I want to feed you. - You're a naughty girl. Yes. Should we sit and eat on the floor? Okay. Or we could do something else on the floor. - We could put sugar on the food. - No. What? I don't know. It's just ... You're smiling! I don't know why. It's just ... There! This will be a great bed to sleep in or whatever you two do. We aren't together anymore. You aren't? No. I didn't know. I'm sorry to hear that. - When did you break up? - The other day. If you want to talk to Mom or me - - just let us know. We're here for you. - Dad? - Oh, sorry. - There'll be other girls. - How do you know? - That's my experience. -You've only known Mom. - Hello? - I got a text from your mom. She can't find the smiley, so she writes 'smiley'. It's funny. She'll have to learn. We started texting more after we moved. She can't find the smiley button. It'll all work out. - Do you want to sleep on our couch? - It isn't big enough. Is there anything else we need to do? Esben and Sandra broke up. Really? They seemed to get along well. Yes, I don't get it. I don't know why. But he was very upset. - Did he break up with her? - No, she broke up with him. What is it? - Why are you laughing? - It's nothing really. It's just ... No, I'll let you finish. Was he upset because he broke up with her? - No, she broke up with him. - Oh. Yes, that's ... Honestly. What is it? Nothing really. Today at work I suddenly had to leave - - because no matter what people said, I started laughing. - I was like that when I was younger. - I remember. You laughed at the most inappropriate times. What are you doing? Stop it, Vibeke. - Stop it! - Do you want a water fight? - Where did you get the cigarettes? - I bought them on the way home. Okay. - Would you like some coffee? - No thanks. Do we have any wine? Yes, why not? That would be nice. Are you going to sleep already? It's so hot in here! Are you sick? I don't know. - Can I get you some water? - Please. No, Kjeld. Don't. How are you feeling? I'm fine. Are you sure? Yes. You don't feel strange? No. Maybe you just need to get some sleep. - He's so cute! - He looks like our old one. Exactly! It's like seeing Snowball again! Aren't you lovely? Do you want to get down? Do you? He's so cute! - What is he doing? - Come here. Christ, he's cute! My God! He's just so cute! Thank you so much. They haven't been this perky for years. I don't mind. Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? Please turn the light off. It'll probably be gone by tomorrow. What is it? - Do you want the light off? - No, it's fine. What are you thinking about? That maybe we should go on an Interrail trip again. - Wouldn't that be nice? - Yes. It was fun. And just quit our jobs. Or we could go back to school. - What would you study? - I don't know. Anything. - Do you know what I'd do then? - No. - I'd take a gap year. - A gap year. We could do whatever we wanted. What is it? What about Esben? Hello? Who is it? Hi, Esben. Mom? It is us. Can we come in for a minute? - Esben. - Esben? Sweetheart ... I know. I just have to get used to the idea. We don't owe him anything anymore. Now it's all about us. You and me. Yes. You and me. - I thought I'd have some vegetables. - Don't you dare do that again! Do you want to be tickled until you give up? Stop it! Don't touch the sauce. - Hello? - It's Esben. Can I come up? - Hi, Dad. - Call me Kjeld, please. - Sure. Hi, Kjeld. - Hi, Esben. What's up? - Is this is a bad time? - We're about to have dinner. We're having a date night. - I just wanted to see how you were. - We're fine. Hi, Esben. - Hi, Vibeke. - How are you? Fine, thanks. I miss you. - I thought we could have some tea. - Some other time. - Fine. - Safe journey home. Thanks. I'm having a housewarming tomorrow night if you'd like to come. You could be my friends. I'd just like you to be in my life. - Aren't you going to eat? - I'm not really hungry. We could go over there. But just to show him how well we're doing. Yes. Of course. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Hi. - Hi. I'm Vibeke. - Hi, Esben. - Hi. Hi. - Congratulations on your apartment. - Thanks. You can put your coats on the bed. - Who are they? - Nobody. - Family? - Forget them. Cheers. What are you doing? - We can give him a hand. - No, that's exactly what we can't do. - I just wanted to clean up a bit. - Let him do it himself. - No. - But ... alright. Let's just enjoy being at a party again. Cheers. A bachelor takes three years. I can only apply through quota two. - Because of your grades? - Yes. All I can do is hope. I don't know if they're good enough. - But I hope so. - So do I. Hi. Are you ready to leave? No, we don't have to on my account. - Okay. - If you're tired, go on home. No, I'll wait for you. - I'll wait upstairs. - Okay. Why psychology? Have you thought about it for a long time? I find the brain and feelings and how it all works interesting. - It's exciting for you. - Yes, we'll see. - Psychology? - Yes. Since when did you take an interest in psychology? - Kjeld. - He's never mentioned it. We're trying to talk here. Okay? He asked me to go to an orientation meeting on psychology next week. Do you want to study psychology too? - Kjeld. - We're taking a gap year. You are. - It's just to see what it's about. - With Esben? Hey. Sweetheart ... Goodnight. Sleep tight. - How do you add a smiley? - Who are you texting? Esben. - How often do you write? - Just add the smiley. You should learn how to do it. It's cute. See you. I'm off. - When will you be back? - I don't know. - What about dinner? - I'll buy a shawarma. Shit! You called Vibeke. Leave a message. - Hi. - Hi. Aren't you asleep yet? - Where have you been? - Out with Esben. - Until now? - We had a couple of beers. I'm exhausted. Where did you go? A place with music. Goodnight. Was it fun? Yes. It was really fun. We laughed a lot. About what? I don't know. He just makes me laugh. We're happy together here, aren't we? Yes. I love you. Did you know that? Likewise. Shit! Hi. Why is it so cold in here? - Do you want some soup? - No thanks. I already ate. I'm applying for psychology. Esben and I talked about meeting later on to look at my application. Okay. When is he coming over? We talked about meeting at his place. We don't want to bother you. You wouldn't. I thought you didn't want him here. I do. He should see what we've done with the place. And we owe him a housewarming. - Current studies. - Attach a copy of your diploma. - Send in your high school diploma. - Right. - I'll find it somewhere. - Got a handle on it, sweetheart? - Yes. - Up here you write study elements. - Elements? - The subjects you want to study. Oh. I thought it was just psychology. You need to have minor subjects like advanced Danish. - As a requirement? - Or an elective. Do you mind? I'm busy right now. Just write, "Hi. My name is Vibeke." Of course. - We should start at the same time. - And be in the same class. Sweetheart? Don't forget to write your full name, address and civil registration number. - What are we listening to? - Some shitty old music. Please turn if off? We don't need music now. - Kjeld, turn it off. - Shall we dance? No, I'm writing my application! Turn it off, Kjeld. What will you do afterwards? - I'll keep studying. - Really? - And get my master's. - Then your title will be ... - Esben Munk Boje. - PhD. Exactly. I'll be really smart. - You are smart! - Sure. Cookies? I don't understand. I think I'll skip that. I want to sit like this. It's losing its hair. A monkey with hair loss. - Sweetheart. - ... you smile when you get up. It's time for bed. Okay. Goodnight. Carpe diem. It's all about having fun. - It's time for bed, sweetheart. - Go ahead. I haven't finished my wine. - We're going to bed together. - I'm sitting on my window sill. - It's time for bed. - We're talking, Kjeld. Just go to bed. - What are you doing? - Stop it! Stop it, Kjeld! What the hell is wrong with you? Are you okay? - Are you? - I'm sorry. Here ... Come here, Kjeld. There, there. It's this body. Stop it. Kjeld, knock it off! Knock it off, Kjeld! Come here. Stop it. Hello? Here. - I miss you. - But I'm right here. You just need some sleep. Alright? Hi. Hi. What's he doing here? He's helping me move. Where to? To his place. But you live here. Kjeld ... It doesn't exist anymore. Does it? Take care. Alright? There will be other girls. Hi, it's Kjeld. Hi. Hi. Thank you. How nice of you. - It's good to see you again. - You too, Kjeld. Come in. - The place looks good. - Yes, we've been busy. - Hi, Esben. - Hello, Kjeld. - Something smells delicious. - Thanks. He's been cooking all day. He's such a good cook. Can we offer you a glass of water, wine or beer? A glass of wine, please. Red, please. You look lovely. Thanks. - You found a really good wine. - Thanks. Thanks. - Were you admitted to psychology? - I gave it up. Why? Should we tell him? We want to have a baby. - A baby? - We want to be parents. So we're working on it. Aren't we, sweetheart? Yeah. But there isn't ... But what? - There isn't enough room for three. - We're looking to buy a house. How is your gap year going? - What? - How is your gap year going? Fine. - Would you like some coffee? - Please. Let me give you a hand, Esben. Thanks. - Do you take milk? - No thanks. - Otherwise it's in the fridge. - Thanks. - How are things otherwise? - Fine, thanks. That's good to know. What's the matter? I just miss you two. We miss you too. We miss you too, dear. Can't we go back to the way it was? I'm afraid it's too late, dear. Dad! I'm so sorry. - Do you have any plans today? - I might take a look at the garden. Right. - It needs work. - Yes. Hi, Esben. Of course you can. Come on over. Okay. See you. - Esben is coming over for lunch. - How nice. - It's delicious. - I'm glad. Is it okay if I spend the night? I can sleep on the couch. - Yes. You're welcome to stay. - Thanks. Would you like some tartare sauce? Pass it to him, Dad. Thanks. Esben? I was wondering ... Maybe you could spend the night some other time? Okay. - I'll be in the garden. - Esben went home. - Wasn't he going to spend the night? - No, something came up. - He asked me to say goodbye. - Thanks. - I guess it'll just be the two of us. - Yes. - So you'll be in the garden? - Yes. Sure thing.
