I go around the world looking for giant waves. - Oh! - And I'm on my way to Oahu. So I stopped here to surf the wedge in Newport and see Anne, of course. - Oh. Of course. - And she's... She's a spectacular woman and very nice. Oh, well, yes. Oh, we've gotta go. - Do you practice a lot? - Um, no. Actually, this is my first time. Um, what about you? Do you practice yoga often? I tried to, since I was 15. Oh, my goodness, that's, um... That's early to start, isn't it? Okay, Mom, we're leaving. Oh, okay. Have fun. - Take care. - Yeah. - Bye. - Oh! - Nice to meet you. - Very nice to meet you. - All good? - Bye. - Bye. Call me, okay? - Yes. Anyone coming? - I said I quit. - Yeah, me too. But... I saw that huge drop in my 401K. And I asked the human resources guy and he said, "Oh, um, this is just due to the market. It's normal." I can't even begin to understand the stock market. The amount of money that I'm gonna get is bullshit! Yeah, believe me, I get it. I get it. And I'm only getting this bullshit amount of money if I make it to full retirement in five years. I'm gonna be working in my 80s. I know. If it all goes to hell, we can be roommates, okay? - Gloria, I'm fucked. - Now, hey, you know what? If they fuck with you, they fuck with me. We're in this together. Right? Hey! Hey, you fuckers! This woman is awesome! Treat her right! - Yeah. - Yeah! She's a good woman, she's a good friend. Respect her. She works her ass off, you fuckers!

Like everyone. - Like everyone. - Mmm-hmm. Do you come here a lot? Yes. Uh... Yes, I'm... No, not a lot. I mean, um, sometimes. When I feel like it. When I can. I like coming here though. I like to dance. By yourself. By myself. I'm divorced. So am I. Oh, really? How long? One year. Recently. - Finally. - Well, yes. Sometimes it's finally, isn't it? I'm trying to change things. Life. What's your name? Gloria. What's this? Just take it off. Yeah, um, it's, uh... It's... It's 500. No, I know... No, I know. I know. It's a lot, but you are covered for a rental the entire time your car is in the shop. Well, I can... I can arrange for you to get into a rental vehicle. I'll just... I'll give them all the information and I'll tell you where... ...you can pick it up. Um... Or better yet, I'm gonna have them deliver it to you, okay? No, it's... No... It's no trouble at all, I can handle it. Believe me, anything you need, I'm here for you, okay? I love cats. - How does it get in? - I have no idea. I shut everything up and that little fucker still gets in. Mm. Maybe it's trying to tell you something. It's like a... It's like a dead thing. It's like an Egyptian mummy cat. Oh, like a sphinx? It doesn't have any hair, Veronica. There's a beautiful story about cats in the Bible. Oh, no, please... Ow! Ow! - Do you want more than that? - Excuse me? Do you want more off the sides? Uh, no. I think I just want it regular, I don't want... A little bit more than that actually, thanks. So, uh, when the big flood came, God told Noah to build a huge ark. And he brought his family. And two kinds of animals from every species that existed in the world back then. - Mmm-hmm. - And soon there where just a ton of mice and they were eating all the food. And Noah didn't know what to do. So he asked God and God said, "Go find the lion, pet its head like this." Three times. And the lion went... Just letting out a gush of air and two cats came out of its nose. Those cats got rid of the mice. And so, order and balance were re-established in the world. Ow! Ow. Sorry, sweetie. And we're gonna hit our ribs softly like this. And we're gonna count one, two, three! Again! Your father, God bless him, left me just enough. And, no... No, I don't... I don't spend much other than... Well, okay. I do like to come here with my girlfriends and have my salad, - but other than that... - No. I know, yeah. It's just that I could live too long. I just don't think there's gonna be much left once I'm gone. I don't need anything. I've been paying my own bills for a long time now. You won't even know it. You're gonna wake up one morning and you'll find yourself a wrinkled old lady just like me. You're not old. You look beautiful. You do. You really do. Because life just goes by in a flash. Like that. I know. You tell me the same thing every 10 years. - Do you see what I mean? - I know, Mom. - You'll be fine. - Of course I will. At least you quit smoking, thank God. Ladies. I'll just... I'll take that, thank you very much. Gloria Bell. Your tenant in apartment 2. You know I live below your son, Mrs. Duffy. Yes. That's... That's actually why I'm calling and I'm so sorry to bother you so late at night, um... - But, you know, I... - Come here! I work and I have to get up early in the morning, you know, so... Why be born? Yes, yes, exactly, and I hate to be the one to tell you this, but are you... Are you aware of what's happening? I just... Your son is... I think your son is having some kind of a... - Some kind of a breakdown. - Is he there - with you? - No. It's all fucked up! Don't go outside! I... It breaks my heart, I mean, honestly... I mean, I'm a mom too, so I... I wanna die! I wanna die! He needs help. I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I hate to do this, but please, please listen. Listen. Don't be born, man! Don't be born! Don't be born! Hello? Uh, no, this is she. No, I'm not mad. Why would I be mad? Are you asking me out? Thank you. You're such a gentleman. I can't get you out of my head. I... I'm really... I'm constantly thinking about you. You're just so... Different. What happened to me with you, I... I thought it was never gonna happen again. My head is still spinning. I didn't dare... It was driving me crazy. I mean I wanted to, but I was too nervous to call you. But I went for it, thank God. So, thank you. Thank you for coming. You're very welcome. Ah. It's okay. Go ahead. - Excuse me, would you? - Yeah, please, it's okay. Hello? Hello. Hello, Suzanne. Okay. Fine, but... There's no reason to cry about it. Um... I... I'm gonna do it before 2:00. Okay? What? Yes, I'll leave the deposit before 2:00. I'm busy now. Just relax, right? Bye. Mm. - So, are you divorced or not? - I am. I am. Hmm, but... You get divorced from the woman, not the kids. - Ah. - Yes. I've been living alone now for a year. But I still have to help out the girls a lot. They're... They're very dependent on me. It's just the way things are, so, you know... It's not all of me, but it's a part of me. My life used to be very different. I was drowning, about to blow and then... About a year and a month ago, I had surgery. What kind of surgery? Gastric bypass. - I used to weight 280 pounds. - I don't believe you. - I swear. - No. - It's true. - No. I... I... I was huge, really. If you don't believe me, here you go. All right, all right. It's there, see? Look at that, see? - I had a size 52 waist. - I'm sorry. Very little neck. I'm sorry. I'm... Oh... Whoa. Whoa! I got you. I got you. Okay. Okay. Oh. Oh! This is the hopper, where the paintballs go in. Okay. This is the pod with 140 paintballs. And now, you take the gun. - You want me to hold it? - Yeah, okay. You put your hand there and this hand around here. - Okay. Mmm-hmm. - Okay? - You got it? - I have it. This is the trigger. All right? Okay? This is the safety. Take the safety off. Now it's an automatic. Okay, now be careful. - Do you want me to shoot? - Not yet. Look through the sight, okay? All right. - A little more... - Okay. - A little more at the target. - At the guy. - Right. Okay? - At the guy. - You can see him, right? - Yes, I can see him. - Okay? And... - Okay. And... - You hit the bull's-eye. - I think he's dead. I love your park. You know, men, they like to play war. I do know that. Capturing the flag. Protecting the president. - Zombie attack. - Hmm.

Honey, this guy could die tomorrow. Mom. We could all die tomorrow. I just saw the news where they sent a boy home for just making a gun with his hand. Oh, wow. You cannot stop boys from playing with guns. And if they don't have one, they're gonna make everything into a gun. Mmm-hmm. When Peter was little, he went into my purse and made a gun out of a tampon. Yeah. What was the trigger? See, we can't even outlaw guns in our own families. That's true. But the fact that a civilian can just walk in and buy a military-style assault rifle is just beyond me. Well, the majority of gun owners are responsible. This is not about the majority. The responsibility that you're referring to is what is going to blow up the whole planet. The planet is as good as blown-up already, my dear. We're just arranged in the deck chairs - of Titanic at this point. - Mmm-hmm. I don't think we should panic. Everything goes in cycles. It's natural. Besides, every generation thinks it's the end. The worst it's ever been. And one generation will be right. Well, when the world blows up, I hope I go down dancing. Hey-hey! - Right? - Yes! Because everything is changing, it's transforming. All the time. Even our physical bodies. I was reading in the science section of the paper about cell renewal. Do you know about that? Yeah. Yeah, I've heard something. Basically, it said that, um, our bodies, even middle-aged bodies, are less than 10 years old. Our skin. The epidermis is recycled every two weeks. Our bones, the human skeleton is replaced every 10 years.

Why drag them into a situation that they're incapable of understanding. Why? So they can say, "Oh, my God, you have a girlfriend? - "You stupid old man." - You're not old. "How could you even think of dating at your age?" I know them. They'd make fun of me and... Why give them the chance? I thought that, you know... Um... I'm a part of your life, aren't I? You're the most important part of my life. Well, then I wanna feel that, and if you're lying to your daughters, then I'm not. - They're grownups, right? - They're not that grown up. I mean, physically they are, but... I don't know if it's a generational thing, but they see me as their father, not as a person. I've always been the one worrying about them. And they've never worried about me, not at all. It's a really lonely feeling. And I don't want you to have to experience that. Hello? Open the door. - Open the fucking door. - Hey! Shit! Shit! This is not your door. What are you doing? Fucking bitch! I'm so happy you could come. Thanks for bringing me. - Happy Birthday, sweetheart. - Thanks. Ooh! This is gonna be a wonderful year for you.

How long has it been? - Four... I think. - Four years? - Five, I think. - Five? - Yes. - Oh, what? Since you got divorced? No, actually since the last time we saw each other. No, we got divorced 12 years ago. - Oh. - Twelve? Really? Yes. Oh, you must be Fiona. - Hi. Hi. - Yeah. - Nice to meet you. - Oh, it's so nice to meet you. Oh, my goodness, you are so pretty. - Oh... - You didn't tell me - how pretty she is. - Please. - No, beautiful. - No, She is. So you haven't introduces us. Oh, I'm so sorry.

Nice to meet you. - Cheers. - Thanks, everyone. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. I'm happy. Thanks for being here. - Mm. - Ah. And cheers. - Cheers. - To your pregnancy. - Oh, you didn't know? - No, I didn't. You're pregnant? - You didn't tell him? - No. - I'm sorry. I... - Oh, really? That's so nice. It's still new, you know, so... Yeah. Oh, well, - you're not showing at all. - Ten weeks, so... Do you have a boyfriend? - Yeah. - That's great. She's the same age that I was. Aw! - Yeah? - Mmm-hmm. Would you like some nuts, Arnold? Yeah, sure. Thanks. Would you like an olive? Sure. - Thanks. - Olive? Thanks. You know, the baby's the same size as an olive right now. It is. Oh! What a nice home you two have. It's just... This is beautiful. I love... Most of this is Rachel's taste, but... Oh. Where is she? I have no idea. Well, I like it too. Congratulations. Thanks. We're moving out soon. So you guys got any plans for Christmas? Do you celebrate that? Oh, my gosh, I haven't even thought about that. We're spending it together. - Oh. Mmm-hmm. - Of course. Yeah. Arnold, my mom tells me that you have some kind of, um, amusement park type thing. - Uh, yes. Vertigo park. - It's so much fun. - Have you ever done paintball? - No, I haven't. Is it real paint? Yes, it's real paint and it's in two teams. So it's kind of like a... I guess it's like a pretend war. - She loved it. - I did. I loved it! You did paintball? Well, I just did the target shooting. She has great aim. Yeah, she sure does, yes, sir. What did you do before? I... I was a marine. After that, I started transporting equipment for them. Were you an officer? Yes. Of course. So you were a military. Yeah. I went in to, uh, pay for school. - Do you have any children? - Two daughters. - How old are they? - 27 and 31. Oh. So like us, more and less. - Mmm-hmm. - Yeah. Well, they're pretty different from you guys. - Are you a grandfather? - No, no. And they aren't married? No, they're single. Very single. What do they do? You mean at this particular moment? Nothing. They're doing nothing. No, but one of them just had a meeting with a friend who owns a pet store and that went very well, didn't it? Yeah, it did. Yeah. And it has the potential to be very lucrative. People love their pets. What part of town are they in? Oh, Redondo. With their mom. Uh, you know, high rents and all that stuff. And what does Mom do? She's a, you know... That's amazing. - Do you want some weed? - Oh. No. Thank you. No? You don't smoke? Well, no. I mean, I've... I tried it long time ago, but now I... I'm afraid I'd lose control. No, don't be silly. - Are you sure? - No. Well, everybody reacts differently, so if you don't mind, I'll just... Who's my grandson's father? His name is Theo. Theo? - Theo what? - Van Gogh. It doesn't matter. He's Swedish. - Swedish? - Mmm-hmm. - Like, does he live here? - No, he lives in Sweden. - But he's coming to live here. - No, he's staying there. - How come? - I'm moving there. - She's leaving. - To go to Sweden? Mmm-hmm. Yes. Wouldn't you? I'd love to move to fucking Sweden. - When? - On the 28th. - It's so soon. - Yes. Wha... You know what, honey? Why don't you read your dad the letter that he wrote you? - E-mail, Mom. - Okay, the e-mail. Read him the e-mail so he can see. - No. - He's a wonderful guy. He's just... Oh, he's so lovely and I think we're both a bit in love with Theo too. No. Mom... - Why, Annie? Come on. - Just cut it out. It'll be nice for your dad. "The only thing I want is to have a life with you. "I discovered that the love in my heart "was being saved for you. "Living the mystery of every day with you "is the most profound thing I can imagine. "I may have been on the biggest waves in the world, "in the deepest waters, "but the deepest thing I can think of is to be with you." Oh, my. Everything is making me cry these days. I don't know why. - Mm! - Look at these two. Look at these two little cuties eating their apples. - Oh, they're so cute! - You loved apples. The people thought they were twins. - They looked like twins. - I know. Our wedding pictures. Here we are, stiff as boards. - We were so naive. - Oh, we were so in love. - We were very naive. - We were in love. Hold it up, hold it up. - No, Peter. - No, for one second. Let's do a quick "then and now" - What's happening? - Peter, we were in love. I know you were in love. Okay. Just hurry up. Hurry up, okay? - Don't cut my head off. - No, no. She's laughing. - We were laughing. - No, stop. You look so much happier now. - Send me a copy. Peter. - I'll send it. Please, send me a... Oh. - Look. - Oh, yeah, okay. Yeah we look great. Yeah. Oh, look at Petey with his necklace. Look at your necklace. Look at that. I bought it on the beach. - Really? - He loved his jewelry. Right? - Aw! - Isn't he sweet? - Oh, look at you! - Oh! I know. And here's Annie. This is the day that she graduated from preschool. I know because I remember that dress. - Look at you in that dress. - I remember that dress. It's so cute. Oh, this... Oh, my God. Here's our wedding cake. We couldn't get married with just any cake. It had to be bigger than we were. Take a look at that. Oh, but look at that frilly dress! Well... It was 1986. - Okay, that's hilarious. - That's what we wore then. - I was not here. - No. You were gone by then. No. I wasn't. Wow. I should've been here. Here. - And I wasn't! - All right. All right. I wasn't here. All right, let's calm down. Dad, you want some water? Arnold? Arnold? Are you in there? Maybe he went down to his car. No, Mom. - He's not here. - He's not. Oh, no, now we woke up the baby. Jeez. Do you think he got sick? Uh, I don't know. Maybe the food that he ate didn't agree with him. He did seem a bit off. Hmm. Oh. He's not downstairs. I'm gonna get the... I'm gonna get the baby. No, no, no. I'll do that, just... Okay. You got him. I'm gonna give him a call. I'll see if I can get him on the phone. All right. Is there another way to get out? No, it's just the entrance and the black door. - It was just a photo. - I know. - It was ages ago. - Yeah. Did you say something, Dad? Nothing. You were here. Arnold. It's Gloria. What happened? Um... I'm still at Peter's and I'm worried, so give me call and let me know where you are, okay? Okay, bye. Sometimes he feels sick. He had surgery recently, and he has a hard time digesting things. He had a lot of olives. So, I think that I... I probably... - Thank you. Uh... - I don't... - I'm sure he'll reappear. - Yeah. - Well, thank you for coming. - Thank you so much. Okay. Mmm-hmm. - All right. - I'm driving. No answer. Okay. I should go. Who is this guy, Mom? Who are you with? Arnold? I'm busy. I'm working. What are you doing here? Can we talk? I don't have anything to say to you. I really need you to listen to me. I do. How could you be so rude, Arnold? For what? I was introducing you to my family. I brought you to my son's birthday party and you have the nerve to just disappear. If you were me, you would've done the same thing. - It wasn't an easy situation. - Really? I searched for your eyes again and again. I didn't exist. "We were in love." - Oh, please. - "We were in love." - He didn't mean to... - How many times - did he have to say that? - He was drunk. - He was... He... - It made me sick! I threw up. I don't know how you could do something like that to me. And the girls called, so... Grow a pair. Take your... Take your toy guns with you. Gloria. - No. No, Gloria. - Okay, fine. Okay, fine. Then I'll keep them. - Gloria, don't go. - I don't want to run you over. - Gloria. - Arnold, please! - I love you, Gloria. - Just get... Get away!

They must be like four and six now, right? Hold on. Don't talk. When you talk, your eye moves and I can't see. What? - Am I going blind? - No. Not necessarily. But in time, if you don't take care of it, your field of vision will get smaller, which will limit your day-to-day life. Like driving, getting around... So I'm afraid I'm going to have to prescribe you these eye drops. They're to be taken in each eye twice a day. Okay? For how long? Unfortunately, for the rest of your life. Please call me if you wanna talk. Mmm-hmm. Thank you for everything, Gloria. Or e-mail me, text me. Any time. I will. Gloria. - These came for you. - Thank you. If you cut your hair or do something different to it, then people think it's the hair that's different. That's why you look different. - Mmm-hmm. - They don't notice the other stuff. Here comes the bride. - You look gorgeous. - Wow. Wow. - Really? - Yeah. Really? Is it not too much? No, no, no. It's special enough for the big day. But you still look like yourself. Yeah. All right. My hair is next, so I'll be back. Okay. It's gonna be a great wedding. She's such a beautiful girl. He calls me every five minutes. Don't pick it up. No, I won't. Hello. Nope, it's Vicky. Uh, she is in the bathroom. And, uh, it's gonna take a long time. Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Bye-bye. I can't believe you did that. I'm gonna jump out and see you off. No, Mom. To help you with your luggage, Annie. It's heavy. No, Mom. Just leave me here, please. I'm not gonna cry. I'm just... I'm just gonna - walk you to the entrance... - Mom. Just be careful, okay? Yes. And e-mail me when you get there, just, you know, to let me know that you're safe. Just "I'm here." It's all I need. Yes, Mom. It's fine. - Take care of my books for me. - I will. - Don't sell them. - I won't. I love you very much. Okay, baby, okay. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Come on, come on. - Please step back, ma'am. - Oh, sorry. Bitch! That's what you are. Bitch! Fucking dumb bitch! That's what you are! What's it all for, huh? What's it all for? Nothing! You gave me nothing! I gave you everything! Oh, you made her fucking love me, did you? You fucking... You've just fucked me around! Your coffee, ma'am. Arnold? - Okay, thank you. - Oh, you're welcome. Thank you. Thank you so much. - Enjoy Vegas, sir. - Thanks. It's beautiful. Good afternoon. Welcome to Caesars Palace. Hello. I have a reservation. - Under what name? - Arnold Tenner. Welcome, Mr. Tenner. One moment, please. Honey. Hello? What's happened now? Well... I'm out of town. Why? What? But how? How did she go through a window? What the... Are the... Are the cuts deep? Are they deep? I'm really sorry. I can't come now. I'm busy. The doctors can take care of it. That's what they do. Yes. The doctors. I have things to do! Please! What happened? My ex-wife's had an accident. My daughters called me and... Suzanne walked right through a glass sliding door. It was too clean. She didn't see it. She crashed through it. Cut herself, uh, badly. On her legs. So stupid. I just, uh, well... I am... I'm not leaving. I'm staying with you. I'm not gonna let them take this away from me. They're not gonna destroy my life. I'm staying here with you. It's what I want. With you. Maybe we should just go back. Gloria. Gloria. Gloria, don't go. You're doing the right thing. It's gonna be fine. Thank you for saying that. You just may not see how difficult this is for me. How can I not see you? I'm looking straight at you. You know, it's not just bad for them to depend on you so much. It's bad for you too. You have the right to your own life. Yes. I do. Do you wanna take a trip? A big trip? Just the two of us. We could... We could go to Europe or Spain. - Spain? - Have you ever been to Spain? - No. - Well, then let's go. Let's... Let's go to Spain. Let's take 10 days off work and go dancing. We both love to dance. Let's do it. You know, we could die tomorrow. Turn it off, okay? All right. My goodness. All right. Mm. Cheers. To Spain. To Spain. I'll be right back. Excuse me. Excuse me. Could I have another one, please? Absolutely. It's weird to bet it all on 11 when my favorite number is 22. - Well, that's my birthday. - Then we'll bet them all. What's your name? - Gloria. - I'm Jen. Nice to meet you. - Very nice to meet you. - Yeah. Let's see how we do. No more bets, please. Black 22. Oh, my God, we won. You won! Oh, what a job! Congratulations! - Good for you! - Thanks! Oh. This is Gloria my new friend. - Hi. Mark. How you doing? - How are you? - Good. - Oh, our friend Jeremy. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Let's keep it going. Twelve? All right. I'll go with that too. Oh, no, no, no! No, no, no. No, no. Please. Please. No, you have no idea. Don't do that. Don't do it. Don't do it. No. God, no. I mean it. Really. I... Take that off. Please take that off. Four, still here. Five, there you go. Six. Whoa! Oh. Excuse me. May I use your phone to call LA? Oh, yes. Of course. Uh, number? - 818-614... - 614... - ...5329. - ...29. - There you go. - Thank you. Gloria. - I got your stuff. - Thanks, Mom. - I'll pay for the tickets. - I already bought them. I'm sorry. When did you get a cat? Just leave him. Mom. Gloria. Okay. Hello? Gloria? Are you there? Say something, please. You have to believe me. I'm so sorry. We need to save what we have. Gloria? Gloria. No. No! I love you. No! No! You shot me! Dad? - What happened? - Daddy, what happened? Oh, my God, help! Help me get him up! Who do you think you are, you fucking old bitch? Gloria!
