(MultiCom jingle) (birds chirp) (child laughs) (rock music) - Oh, good to see you made it. - Hey, Grandpa. - Hey, Eric. Good to see ya, boy. - You too. You know, nothing ever changes around here. - Nah, just the seasons. When the heck was the last time you were up for a visit? - It was... I'm not sure. - I think it was your grandma's funeral, wasn't it? - Yeah, I guess. - Yeah, you were just a kid in high school then. - Yeah, back when I had my whole life ahead of me. - Yeah, you still do. Yep, you know where to put your stuff. So go on, get settled in. - Wow, you made some changes here. - Yep. - To Eric, love Grandma? - Merry Christmas! - Thanks. - Ah, your grandma, she picked it out. You know how she was. Always had to have the Christmas shopping done before the Fourth of July. Yeah, she had all the presents. She passed on and I kinda forgot about 'em. Forgot all about Christmas. - Do you know what's in here? - Nope, but I must admit I am a little anxious to see. - Let's find out. Wow. The Atlantis. - Huh, look at all that. - It's everything you need to get her off the ground. - Yeah, your grandma. She was nothing if not thorough. She'd put batteries in presents that weren't even battery operated. - And she always knew what I wanted. - Yeah, I don't recall you were into rockets and all that space stuff. - I was. - Sure is a beauty. You did a fine job. - Yeah, you know, being here, building a model. It really takes me back. You wanna sit with me tomorrow? - Sure. What time's liftoff? 0800? - Houston's figured an afternoon launch would be better. You know, give the crew longer to rest up. - Okay, Houston. We read you loud and clear. - I wish grandma was here to see how it turned out. - Yeah, and I wish she was here too to see how fine you turned out. (lazy country guitar music) (ominous music) - [Man] Horton, we really wanted to help out our fellow man, we'd be caught and-- (Grandpa laughs) - Hey, Eric. You gotta come see this. (Grandpa laughs) Eric? (Grandpa laughs) (boards creak) (child laughs) (thud) (ominous music) (thud) (door creaks) - Grandpa? - Hello, there. - Morning. - You come looking for work? - Sure, I guess. - Well I can always use an extra hand. Why don't you stack that wood up against the wall there? Whoa, be careful. - What is that, a tree root. - Yeah. So stubborn that when they built the house they just left it there. Lucky for you, they chopped it out. - Why's that? - If they hadn't, you'd be sleeping in that tree. It would've gone right up through your bedroom. (child laughs) (faint rock music) (spoon vibrates) (rock music) - Well, old car needs oil like a man needs beers. Keeps us both running in our classic years. Now I hate to say it Eric, but you look like walking death. You been having trouble sleeping? - Yeah, I've been having weird dreams. - About what? - I dunno, I can never remember 'em. I just know they're spooky. - Yeah, well maybe that's the result of a guilt conscience over sleeping too much! - Yeah, but sleep will keep me running in my classic years. - Yeah. You'll probably be up on blocks at 50. (TV static) (crickets chirp) (clock ticks) (ominous music) (thunder claps) (fire cackles) (thunder claps) - Well, he's alive. I was ready to put a mirror under your mouth and see if it would fog. - What am I doing here? - What, something wrong with your bed? - What the hell? My clothes are damp. - Boy, I've never seen anyone sleep so sound. I bet you could sleep standing up. - That's my beauty sleep. - Well, you're gonna be one handsome fella. You hungry? - I'm starving. - How about we go to town and get something at the diner? - Sure. - And maybe you can take me for a spin in that fancy new car of yours. (Grandpa hollers) - [Man] Somebody cooked him like a Thanksgiving turkey. My question is do we put him back in the ground or not? We gotta wait for word from the sheriff. Nobody gets in here. No more tonight, you read me? I catch me one-- - What was that? - Oh, somebody. Kids, most likely. Dug up a grave last night, opened the coffin and burned the body. Not your grandma's, thank God. - Holy shit. Who's grave was that? - Emmet. Emmet Gibson. He was a fella that surprised a look of folks some years back when he killed his self. Shot himself in the head. - Damn, did you know him? - Oh yeah, from way back. - Man, so much for the sleepy little town. - Yeah, but I'll tell you something Eric, you remember this: you think you know somebody real well, but it turns out you really didn't know 'em at all. (child laughs) - Hello, I'm Julia. - I'm Eric. - I know. - Oh. I think this is yours. - Thanks. Thank you.

You hear what them kids done out on Lakewood Cemetery the other night? - What kids? They catch 'em? - Nah. Had to be kids, on drugs. Who else would go and disturb poor ole Emmet's grave like that? I tell you, that guy had it tough enough when he was livin'. He sure don't need no more trouble dead. - Amen. You know Pete, you can sermonize all you want, so long as you keep pouring this holy water. Well okay then. See ya later. - Hey, you drive careful now. - Don't worry about me.

Depends upon who you ask. - What's going on? - Now come here. I want you to see something. - What? - Look, look. - What? What am I supposed to be seeing? - The tree house. - Oh yeah. It's seen better days. - Yeah, I remember I built that so you can hide out and use that for you spy post, remember? - Yeah, I also remember falling out and breaking my arm. - Yeah, well it wasn't the result of any structural flaws. I mean I built that solid. Three steps so you can get in and out. Yeah, well I'm gonna go in town and get myself some lunch. Wanna come along and get some breakfast? - No, I just had some cereal. - Okay, well I figure I'll bring back a pizza for supper. - Sounds good. (ominous music) - [Grandpa] That was somebody, a kid most likely. Dug up a grave last night, opened a coffin, and burned the body. - Julia? - Isn't it a beautiful day? - Not as beautiful as you. What the hell am I wearing? - Such language. - Hey this is great. Look at this. This is a dream. - No, no. No. - Yeah it is. - Does it matter? (Julia screams) No, not yet. It's not right. Stop. - [Child] Mommy. (Julia yells) (shotgun fires) - Tomorrow night. - Ouch!

(bell rings) - How's this? - That'll work. - [Cashier] How much do you weigh? - [Eric] Um... - Now you need a lock. These are cool. You can set your own combination. Like birthdays and stuff. I'll set one for you. Guess what this is? - 7-30. July 30th, what? Is that your birthday. - No, 7:30. That's what time I get off. Hint, hint. That's 23. Thank you. Yeah, so if you're not doing anything later, I'm not doing nothing. So maybe we can do something. (clerk scoffs) (ominous music) - Hey, there he is. - I only made it halfway through that bottle the other night. I've come back to rectify the situation. - Well you gotta respect a man for seeing the job through. So what's new and exciting in your life. - Not much. My grandson's still staying with me. - Oh, seems like everyone's got company. You know Wayne Clempett was in here earlier. Had his granddaughter with him, up from Chicago. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Pretty little thing. You know, I always figured Wayne for one mean SOB. Didn't give two shits for nobody. - Well you won't get no argument here. - Yeah, but you oughta see him around that girl. He's like a different person. Laughing, making jokes. I tell you, he really dotes on her. - [Man] Either the body was stolen by members of a cult that uses human bones in their ceremony, or else. - [Guy] Or else what? - [Man] She's not dead. - [Guy] She's not dead? Are you mad!? I saw her die. The doctor signed the certificate. I saw them do it. - You still up, Carrie? - Yeah, I was gonna take a shower before I went to bed. - Your mother asleep? - Yeah, she was real tired. - It's no wonder. You two rode a long way to get here. (Carrie laughs) - Well I guess I'll take my shower now. Do you want to get in there first? - No, you go ahead. - Okay, Grandpa. (demonic whispers) - Grandpa? Are you watching? I like it when you watch me. I want to dance for you. This is all for you, okay? I like it. Yeah. Oh yeah, faster. Faster, faster. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Harder, Grandpa. Yeah. I love you, Grandpa. Do it over and over. (Carrie moans) I want you, Grandpa. (thud) (water pouring) - No! (fire cackles) (Dirty Old Man screams) (melancholic music) - That was a ell of a thing that happened to Bill Mitchen. - Something happened to Bill? - Oh yeah, didn't you hear? Night before last, his bus caught fire. Couldn't get out in time. - He's dead. - Oh yeah. Course the way he drank, he was an accident waiting to happen. And you two guys went to school together, didn't... (siren wails) Now what the hell? - I gotta go. (phone rings) - Hello, Stinky Pete's. No, no. He just left. Hey, where's the fire, anyway? I'll be damned. It's Wayne's house! Well we were just talking about him. What in the hell is going on in this town anyway? (police sirens wail) (melancholic music) ("Star Spangled Banner") (knocking) - [Eric] Yeah? - Are you gonna watch the ball game? It's starting. - Oh, yeah. I'll be right there. - I'll go pop some popcorn. You want the cheesy popcorn or the plain kind? - Cheesy. Let's live dangerously. (organ music) (train horn) (crickets chirp) (ominous music) - Hey, how many of those you making over there? Can't get too many trick or treaters way out here. - Well folks around here, they know me. Bring their kids by on the way back from town. - Yeah, I guess if there's any leftover we'll just have to eat 'em ourselves. - Well that's a fringe benefit. But remember, I have leftovers until tomorrow. Don't let me catch you snacking on any of the candy while you're giving it out. - While I'm giving it out? What're you gonna be doing? - I'm gonna be busy. Remember: you're the treater, I'm the tricker. See, I got me a scarecrow suit this year. So the kids'll think I'm made of straw, till I jump up and give 'em a scare. Boo! (kids scream) (Grandpa laughs) Well looks like that's all the kids that's coming. Let's call her a night. God darnit. Eric, I got myself stuck in here. Come get me down. Guess I'm playing this part too well. Hey, what're you up to? Get me down. Are you crazy? Eric, stop that. Stop it. Get me down. Eric, this ain't funny. What's got into you? (Grandpa screams) (somber music) - I love you, Eric. - [Eric] I love you, Julia. ("Holding on to the Days" by Graphic Nature) (MultiCom jingle)
