This program is rated G and is suitable for general audiences. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Here you go. Thank you. Oh, that was wonderful. What a beautiful day for a ride. Our last ride. At least we got to fit one in before I go. But I don't want you to go. It's only for the summer. That's a long time, Mom. Erin... ...you know your dad doesn't want you to call me that anymore. I don't care what Dad says. You're my Mom, and you always will be. But your dad and I are divorced now and... he's seeing someone new. Yeah. Bethany. I hate her. That's because you don't know her. Which is why your dad and I thought that my summer vacation was the perfect opportunity for you and Bethany to spend time together, without me around as a distraction. But why do you have to go so far? Because Parable is a magical place. I was your age the last time I there. But what if it's, like, totally changed and it's really horrible now? Well, I guess I'll find out. Can I come visit? That's up to your father. But we'll stay in touch. Okay? Constantly. I'm gonna miss you so much. Me too, sweetheart. Me too.

I wouldn't do that, if I were you. Do what? Well, leave your purse there and turn your back on it. You're practically begging someone to take it. In Parable? Even Parable isn't immune to crime. Well, I guess you would know. Thanks for the tip. Have a nice day, ma'am. You too. Hi! Hi. Ms. Kendall? Tara. Please. Joanna Barlow. Nice to meet you. Welcome to Parable. Thank you. So, how are we doing in the first-impression department? So far, so good. Come on, let me give you the grand tour. Can I help you with your bags? Oh, no, no. I'll get-- I'll get them later. Okay. Watch your step here. Well, this is it. Dad's a stickler for authentic-- read, "fusty and musty." Mom wanted to modernize the place. He grumbled a bit, but secretly, I know he likes it. I bet. They retired to Florida a couple of years ago and transferred the title to me and my husband, but we have a bigger working ranch, and we're happy there. We should probably sell this place, but, you know, sentimental value. Wow. What a beautiful view. Mm. Is that what brought you here? The view? Because if you Google "off the beaten track," there's bound to be a picture of Parable. I came here for a few weeks as a girl. Summer camp at the dude ranch. Whisper Creek? Yeah! Yeah. I looked it up online. I know it's no longer in operation. No, not anymore. That's too bad. Some of the happiest days of my life. And I could really use some happy right now. You know, bad divorce. - Ah. - Yeah. - I got it. - What is that sound? Oh, let me show you. Bawk! They're overflow from the ranch. We've been roosting them here. I'll come by tomorrow to collect them. How fun. Chickens? Fun? Yeah! Leave 'em here! I'll take care of them. Uh, chickens are a lot of work. I'm not afraid of work. Okay, if you want. I'll have my son, Dawson, come by to get you up to speed. He's an expert. Okay. Great. All right. Good to see ya. Hey. Don't tell me you brought me lunch. I won't, 'cause I didn't. To what do I owe the pleasure? I just thought I'd stop by and say hi. Uh-huh. Okay. You got me. It was all Kendra's idea. That sounds like it. Yep. You remember her cousin, Julie, from Billings? Yeah. Sure. Got married last summer, right? Uh, she called that off, actually. Oh. Well... I'm sorry to hear that. Anyway, she's gonna be visiting this weekend. I thought you might want to come over for a barbecue. You're not trying to set me up, are ya? Absolutely. I really wish you wouldn't do that. You told me you were ready to start dating again. No, that's not what I said. I said I'm ready to start thinking about dating again. There's a big difference! Julie's a fun girl. Yeah, I'm sure she's a fun girl. She's also young. She's never been a mom. I got the boys. And the evidence would suggest that she's marriage-shy. Boone, I'm not talking about marriage. I'm talking about a barbecue. Look, Hutch. I appreciate it, I really do, but if I'm gonna walk through that door, it's gotta feel right going in. That's all there is to it. What you had with Corrie was really special. You make a lousy good ol' boy, you know that? Look who's talking! Ah... love ya anyway. Take care. ♪ Headed down south ♪ With nothin' but the stars above ♪ ♪ This lonely night I can't get through... ♪ Bingo. You are a genius, Tara Kendall. - - Oh! Ow! Or not. Oh, that's a winner. All right, boys. Time for dinner. Okay? Let's go. Come on. That's good. Squeezing the gloves, right? So what'd you guys get up to at day camp today? Played baseball. With girls. Boring. Girls? What have you got against girls? There's only like a dozen campers, Fletcher. If they don't team us up with the girls, we can't play baseball or anything. We don't need to play baseball. What? Who are you and what have you done with my son? My kid loves baseball. Nicole tagged him out at home today. Ahh. I was safe! Her mitt never touched me. And if it had, it would've been icky! "Icky"? Let me tell you something, young man. One of these days, you are going to like girls. No, I won't. - Mom was a girl, you know. - Uh-huh. No, she wasn't. She was... a mom. Mm. You know what I miss about Mom? - What's that, bud? - Her spaghetti sauce. What? Are you saying you don't like my sauce? Mom's was better. It's the same recipe! It doesn't taste the same. Well, how's it supposed to taste? I don't know, more like Mom's. May I be excused? Yeah. Yeah, sure, Fletch. Go ahead. Any idea what's eating your little brother? Oh, you know. Right. He doesn't like it when we talk about Mom. I mean, it's sad that she's gone and all, but, like... we should be able to talk about her still. Yeah, I agree. Absolutely. We should be able to talk about her. But here's the thing, Griff. Ahem. You're the older brother. Fletch is always gonna be playing catch-up, so I think we just have to... we have to be patient with him, that's all. Okay. I will. I'm gonna go check on your brother. You finish up and then clear the table, okay? - Okay. - Thattaboy. Oh, yeah, and this time-- when you do the dishes, put the dishes in the dishwasher. ...Spinach, cabbage, uh, ground-up eggshells. Eggshells? Isn't that a little cannibalistic? Not for the chickens, I guess. Uh, we'll be mixing up a special batch for them later in the week-- I could bring you some. Yeah, that would be great, thanks. So, um, are we raising them to be eaten? We usually just keep 'em for the eggs. Oh, okay, well, I will too, then. They're gonna lay a lot of 'em. The local supply store will buy the extras off of you. While you're there, I'd get yourself a good pair of gloves, 'cause, this breed... they like to bite. Oh. Good to know. You look like you could use some help. Thanks. I-I could. Um, I am looking for a pair of work gloves, and I don't know what kind to-- I'm sorry. Are you-- Are you Casey Elfman? My clever disguise fails again. I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I am a huge fan. Well, I can never hear it enough. Now, what are you gonna be doing in these work gloves? Warding off chicken bites. Ah! Follow me. - Hey, Leonard. - Hey! You got a new customer here. Snag her a pair of those heavy duty, lifetime-guarantee work gloves. You got it. So you live here? When I'm not on the road, Parable's my safe-haven. Yeah. That "safe-haven" being a thousand-acre ranch. She even has a private runway for her jet. So I can get here quicker and stay longer. And we wouldn't want it any other way. She's done us proud. Aw. I'm Tara, Tara Kendall, by the way. I'm spending the summer here. Well, it's nice to meet you, Tara. - Yeah, welcome to Parable. - Thanks. Now, you take good care of her now, Leonard, d'you hear? I'll do my darnedest. 'Kay. See you later. Bye. Wow! It's pretty cool, right? So cool! - - Okay, okay! Okay, you guys. Sorry I'm late. There you go. There you go. Ow! No! No-no-no-no! No-no-no-no! No, no. Get back here! Oh, no-no-no-no-no! Come on. Get back here. Come on, let's go see your friends. Come on. No, no. No. No. No, no, no. Go this way. Go this way. Come on. Whoa! Almost. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on. Not underneath the truck! Oh! Okay. All right. Come on. You can do it! Tch-tch-tch-tch. She looks pretty comfortable under there, huh? Oh! I'm-- I'm sorry, I-- No problem. No worries. She can't go anywhere. So, you, uh, you must be renting Joanna's place? Yes. For the summer. Do you know the Barlows? Oh, yeah, yeah, you could say that. This is Parable, ma'am. Everybody knows everybody. Well, then it's not "ma'am," it's Tara. Tara Kendall. Tara. Nice to meet you. I'm Boone Taylor. This is my place. Now, why do I feel like I know you from somewhere? The gas station, the other day. Yes, I remember-- uh, red convertible, New York plates? You will be pleased to know that I escaped with my purse unsnatched. Oh, I am pleased, yeah. Because if it had been snatched, it'd make a lot of extra work for me. I'd have to hunt the guy down, bring him to justice... and just imagine all the paperwork. Oh, you don't like your job? I like fishing better. Mm. Ooh! What happened to your hand? Oh, uh, chicken bit me. Yeah, you need gloves with that breed. Yeah, I forgot to put them on. Still getting the hang of poultry management. Why don't you just get the Barlows to take the chickens off your hands? I am in the country for the summer, and I'm gonna do country things. Okay, well, let's, uh, let's see if we can get this chicken. Come here. Where'd you go? There we go! Now, you think you can get this bad boy home safe? I will give it the old college try. All right, the important part here is to try and hold it tight enough so it can't fly away, but not so tight that you smother it. There you go! Perfect. Hey. Well, thank you for saving the day. It's fine. Of course. Oh, uh, you should give me your e-mail. My e-mail? Yeah, then I'll give you mine and my cell phone number. I think folks around here ought to have a way to get ahold of one another. Of course. "NYFTU..." I don't know that one. Uh, "New York Federated Teachers' Union." So you're a teacher! Oh, that's would explain the summer rental. Well, excellent detective work, Sheriff. Oh, I've been known to summon the chops from time to time. As long as it doesn't interfere with your fishing? All right, well, we'll be on our way. - Okay. - Thanks again. Bye. Good luck! Hi, buddy. Joanna! - Hey, you. - Hey. How's everything going? Well, I figured out how the gas works, I've stopped looking for the New York Times on the front porch every morning, a chicken hasn't bitten me in days-- although, I have been tempted to bite a few of them. Well, if anything comes up that needs tending, you let me know. I love to ride and-- are there stables in the area that I could rent a horse? Uh, not that I know of, but you're more than welcome to come to the ranch and ride one of ours. Oh, I wouldn't want to impose. Please, it would not be an imposition at all. Although, you know, Boone Taylor has horses, and he lives right next door to you. Oh, yeah, I've seen his horses. Do you think he'd rent me one? Not in a million years! But he'd let you ride one. You should get to know him. He's a nice guy. Oh, we've met. Um, but let me ask you something. I've seen two boys... Oh. Yeah. Griffin and Fletcher. But no mom. Is he divorced? He's widowed. Three years now. Oh, that's awful. Yeah. Corrie was pretty wonderful. We all loved her. Well, I should go. It was really good to see you, Tara. You, too. Hey! If you're not doing anything Friday night, I recommend you get yourself to the Parable Saloon. How come? Casey Elfman is working on material for her next album. Wow, uh... yeah, I'm not missing that. Good! Okay, we'll see you there. - Thanks! Bye. - Bye. Erin! Hi. Hi, Tara. See? I'm trying. What's up? Uh, I just came in from a ride and I was thinking about you. How are you? Not great. What's going on? Dad wants to send me to camp. Oh, that could be fun. It's in Maine. For six weeks. Oh. The whole point of you going away is for me to spend time with Dad and Bethany, but now they want to get rid of me. I'm sure that's not true. Yes, it is. Can you please talk to him? Erin... Please? No. I can't. You guys have to work these things out on your own. I'll be miserable in Maine. Then tell your dad that you don't want to. If Bethany becomes my new mom, I'm going to die. No, you won't. You'll be fine. I promise you. I just miss you so much. I miss you, too. I should probably go. The new nanny's probably coming to pick me up. Okay, I'll talk to you later. Okay. Bye. Bye-bye, sweetheart. Hello? Boone? It's Tara. There's someone in my house. Okay, well, go outside. I'll be right there. You all right? Yeah, I am. He's inside. You saw him? No, I could hear him. I think he's in the kitchen. Okay, you stay right here. Okay. Be careful! Yes. It's Hiram. Who's Hiram? I'm goin' in. - Be careful! - Shh! Quiet. Well, that should do it. Shooed him out the back door. What? You didn't arrest him? I was going to, but... he's a raccoon, so it'd be weird-- tiny handcuffs. Oh, come on! Should we go take a look? Yes. I thought it was funny. Come on! Well, at least he hasn't learned how to open the refrigerator yet. He does this a lot? Whenever opportunity presents itself. The, uh, the latch on the window that he came through must be broken. I can't believe I was so scared of a raccoon. Oh, I wouldn't be embarrassed about that. I'll bet you that if I was in New York and heard a bunch of weird noises like that, I'd be just as rattled. Back there, in New York, I am universally acknowledged for my savvy and competence. Here... not so much. Ah, you'll get the hang of it. Thank you for saving the day. Again. Apparently, your new job is to run interference with me and Parable's animal kingdom. Don't worry about it. it's my pleasure. Ah, what do you say we start cleaning up this mess? Oh, no, no, no, no. You should get back to your boys. - You sure? - Yeah. Yeah, I got this. Let me walk you out. I won't argue with you. All right. - Hey! - Dad, where were you? There was an emergency next door. What're you guys doing up? Fletcher had one of his nightmares. Oh, buddy. Come here. Ohh... it's like picking up a baby rhino now. You're getting so big. I made him warm milk like you do, Dad. Oh. Best brother in the world, hmm? Listen, Fletch. Everybody has nightmares. Do you? Yes! Of course I do. Yeah. It's just... just part of life, you know? But here's the thing that you have to remember about nightmares, and this is really important, okay? You always wake up. And when you do, everything's gonna be okay. And your brother and I will always be there to make sure that everything is okay. Yeah? - Yeah. - You got it? Now, it's late. You guys got to get to bed, okay? Off you go! Boom. Goodnight! Goodnight. Found this on the bookshelf. I bet it was your grandfather's. You should give it a try. I don't think that's on my reading list. I'm sure it's not! Kind of looks like Montana. It's a Western. It's a whole genre-- cowboys, shoot-'em-ups-- they can be a lot of fun. More eggs? Oh, yes, please. Thank you. Thanks again for the book. I'll return it when I'm done. Oh, no rush. And your grandfather has a whole collection of those, if you want to read more. Oh, cool! Hey, guys! Hey, Dawson. Hey, Dawson. How you doin', bud? I'm good. How are you guys? - Good. - Good to see you. Good morning, Boone. Good morning, Tara. Uh, I would like to introduce you to Fletcher and Griffin. - Boys, this is Tara. - Ma'am. Pleasure to meet you, boys. Uh, a little something came up this morning, and I was hoping that maybe I could ask a favor. Of course. I have a court appearance in Missoula today. Did the lawman break the law? No. But a fella who had one too many and took his truck for a spin did. How can I help? Well, they up and canceled day camp today, and I really didn't want to leave the boys at home by themselves. - We'll be fine, Dad! - Zip it. I would be delighted to have some company. I've made a fresh pitcher of lemonade. I don't like lemonade. It's too sweet. Well, you'll like mine, then, because it's just sweet enough. Well, there you go. All right, you two. You behave. Thank you. Good luck! Come on, boys. All right. What do you want to do? I'm glad you like it. Not too sweet? No. It's good. Do you have any threes? Ah, let's see. Yes. I win. Again? Now I know why you taught me this game. Our mom taught it to us. I wish I had the chance to play it with her. She would've beat you. Every time. I'm sure she would have. You must miss her. I do. All the time. But "she loved us very much, and she wouldn't have left us for anything in the world, if she could've helped it." My dad told us that. I'm sure she wouldn't have. We're doing just fine. Not every family has a mom, you know. We're not that unusual. That's true. I still miss her. Of course, you do. Another game? Sure, but I am still not playing for money. - - Hey, Dad. Hey, boys. House is still standing. That's a good sign. Race ya. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Boys! What do you say? - Thank you, ma'am! - Thanks, Tara. - - Anytime! They're good boys. Yeah. I think so. They act like tough guys, but they're really a couple of softies at heart. I guess they take after their mother. So, was justice served in Missoula? Gotta wait for the jury to weigh in, but I did my part. But now... I'm gonna fix that broken window latch. You don't have to do that. Oh, I know I don't, but can't Hiram or his friends waking you up-- I need my sleep. Don't worry, it'll just take a minute. But I'm thinking that maybe... yeah. Yeah, it's gonna cost you. Oh? Yeah, I wanna see how unsweet that lemonade really is. - Oh, really? - Yeah. Yeah? All right. Well, um, right this way. Great. So, really, the kids-- the kids were behaved? Now, that is what I'm talkin' about. Too much sugar's a deal-breaker. Amen to that! Ooh, that's good. Joanna told me about your wife, and the boys and I talked about it a bit today. I'm so sorry. Thank you. That must have been hard. Yeah. Yeah, it was. But, you know, it's been a while and, um... ...well, things are starting to get a little bit better. Anyway, how about you? You, uh, you ever been married? Yeah. Uh, divorced now. Ah. It got pretty ugly. Now that sounds hard. It's pretty complicated with... with me and James. That's my ex. We share a daughter together, it-- his daughter, technically, from-- from a previous marriage, but she was so little when her mom died, she doesn't... she doesn't remember. I'm the only mother she's ever known. It's gonna be hard to be that mom, now that you're divorced. Yeah. That's what hurts the most. I have a question, Boone. Hmm? Those beautiful horses of yours... I love to ride, and, um, well, I was wondering if, um, if you would consider renting me one from time to time? No, no. Not in a million years. I don't rent horses. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't-- But if you wanna take one for a ride sometime, come on by. Okay, it wasn't that funny. Joanna told me that you would say that. Well, so much for the man of mystery, huh? Thank you for watching the boys. Well, thank you for fixing the latch. To protect and serve, ma'am. It's the lawman's code. Oh! You should get yourself to the saloon on Friday night. I know. Casey Elfman. - Joanna told me. - Ah. - Yeah. - Okay. See you there. - See you there. - Okay. Hey! You made it! Oh, I wouldn't have missed this for the world. - Boone. - Hey, Tara. How're you doing? Everyone... this is Tara Kendall. She's renting Mom and Dad's place for the summer. - Hi. - Hi. Slade Barlow, and I'm shackled to this one. And grateful every day of his life for it. Hutch Carmody. My wife, Kendra. Ahh. This is stunning. Thank you. Nice to meet you all. I didn't miss anything, did I? - No. - Nope. Just, uh, just in time. Here she comes. Howdy, neighbors! Hey!

Babe, Dawson's gonna worry if we stay out past midnight. I will bring some of Dawson's magic chicken feed tomorrow, if that's okay? Yeah, oh, yeah, that'd be wonderful. - Okay. Bye. - Bye! - Hey, babe? - Yeah? Why don't you just, uh... go ahead and I will meet up with you in just a sec? - Okay. - Goodnight. Well? Uh... "well" what? You and Boone. Me and Boone? There's no "me and Boone". Well, it looks like there could be. Because we danced? I have not seen Boone dance with anyone in a long while. I just got out of a terrible divorce a little over a year ago, Kendra. I'm not looking to get involved with anyone. This does not have to be a "forever" thing, especially seeing as you're only here until September. I came to Parable to unclutter my life. The last thing I need is a romantic complication. All right, fine. Fair enough. But thanks for not saying it's none of my darn business! It was really great meeting you. You too. I'll see you tomorrow. Morning, boys. Hi, Tara. - Hey there. - Hey. So, this morning, you get your choice, but I gotta be honest, I gotta warn ya, Bert... he's a little ornery. And Ernie here, he's even worse. Hmm. You don't scare me, Ernie... Ah-hah! And I have a soft spot for gingers. Well, then, Ernie it is. Uh, any good places to ride? Yeah, there's a good trail behind the house-- winds down to the river, it's a nice run. Oh, excellent. Whoa. Uh... Any, uh, signposts I should look for along the way? I'm definitely going with you, and I can ride that run in my sleep. I'm an experienced rider, Boone. I don't need a wrangler. Oh, no, no, no. It's not for you. No, it's for Bert. Yeah, if Ernie takes off without him, he's gonna get all jealous-- we can't have that. Seriously? Oh, yeah. Right, boys? True, Tara! We always ride 'em together. Always ride 'em together. Well, you better keep up... 'cause I don't like being slowed down. Oh, is that right? That's right. - I'll do my best! - All right. Keep up! Let's go. Wow. She can really ride. She sure can. This is so beautiful. Yeah, I never do get tired of it. You know, the first day I was here, Joanna asked me if-- if I'd come for the views. In a way, I did. How did you know they were here to be seen? Well, I came here to Whisper Creek for a few weeks when I was 12. Ah... Those weeks, I've carried them with me. When I closed my eyes, I would... I would see this place. You know, it carried me through a lot of rough times. Yeah, I know what you're talking about. This place, this land, it just gets in your blood. Now, I don't know about you, but... riding makes me hungry. Oh, yeah, me too. Oh! I'm so happy you said that. No, you didn't! Oh, yes, I did. Thank you so much for today. Oh, my gosh, I just-- I love to ride. You can tell. You sit a horse as well as anyone I've ever seen. Well, I might be useless around chickens or raccoons, but I-- I have been riding most of my life. Well, since I came here as a little girl. Those first couple of rides, there's nothing quite like it. Nope. No, there surely isn't. Listen, um... tell me. How do you feel about fish? I love seafood. No, no, no. Not eatin' 'em... catchin' 'em. Oh, uh, well, I-- I don't know, I've never tried. I was gonna go tomorrow. You could come-- show you how to do it? Sure. I-I could do that. Um, oh, but I refuse to touch worms. Pathetic city girl. Come on, I'll walk you outta here. Hey! Hey! I brought some feed. Thanks. So? How was the ride? It was pretty great. Boone rode with me. Oh, right. "Bert and Ernie." They do not like to be separated. No, they don't. You know what he did that was so sweet? He brought along a lunch that he'd made. Oh. He's a thoughtful guy. Yeah, and the other day, he-he fixed that broken window, without me even asking. You know, it has been a long time since a man's done nice things for me. You're starting to fall for him. I-I could. I could. I really could. But... I can't. Why not? Uh, because I'm-- I'm here to regroup. T-To heal. Well, maybe he can help you do that. I need to do it on my own. Well, it's going to be hard to avoid him-- him living right next door to you and all. I know! - I mean... - "I mean" what? I-- I-- He asked me to go fishing with him tomorrow, and I said yes. Is that right? Why did I do that? I know I should keep him at an arm's length. I know I should. Well, it sounds to me like you are not at all sure about what it is you know, or what you want. No. I'm not. I'm not sure at all. Oh, that's only because you haven't caught anything yet. Do you catch a lot? Most days? Nothing at all. But I'm not doing this for the fish. For me, this is... this is meditation. Yeah, I can see that. Yeah. Tell me about Corrie. What was she like? My wife... was so full of life. She really was. She just lit up. Every single day, she just lit up. We were partners. Best friends, right from the get-go. That's the relationship I was hoping-- wanted-- ...expected to have with James. No matter how much I gave, I got next to nothing in return. It sounds like you're blaming yourself for the divorce. Sometimes, it's hard not to. But no, I don't. Good. You shouldn't. You have a strange effect on me, Boone Taylor. Do I? "Strange," huh? "Strange" good? Well, when you're interested in a man, you probably shouldn't talk to him about your failed marriage, yet here I am. I'm sorry, you lost me when you said "interested in a man." Are you? I am. Whoa, oh, oh, you got one, you got one. You got one! There you go. Pull it in, pull it in. That's it. You gotta reel it in! You gotta hold on to the rod. No, you're doing great! Just reel it in. Pull it in. Yeah. Okay, hold on, I gotta get the net! Bring him in, bring him in! Bring him in, bring him in! There you go! - Look at that! - Look at that! You caught your first fish! Right? Congratulations. That was fantastic. Hello, James. Tara, hey! Great to hear your voice. How are you? I'm fine. Uh, why are you calling? Well, it's... it's Erin. Is everything okay? Not really. She just chased off the fourth nanny in three weeks, and now the agency is refusing to send anyone else. Well, she's getting a little old to have a nanny. She's almost 13. Yeah, I know. It's... it's not just that. It's Bethany-- Erin's being just awful to her. I thought, with me out of the picture, this was their time to bond. Yeah, that's what I was hoping, but it's not exactly working out that way. James, you want something. You wouldn't be calling if you didn't, so just tell me what it is. Erin and Bethany, they need a-- a break from each other, and Beth and I need some time together, just the two of us, without, you know... ...Without your daughter getting underfoot? I get it, and that's why you wanted to send her to camp. Oh! You-- You know about that? Erin and I may not be able to see each other, James, but we still talk. Of course, you do. Okay! There you go. I was thinking that you might enjoy a visit from her. It was her idea, actually. A couple weeks in the country-- maybe longer? Might be good for her. I-- I could do that. Really? 'Cause I can get her on a plane Tuesday, or-or Wednesday, if that works? Yeah, either. Either works fine. That would be amazing. I'll have my office make all the arrangements and send you the details. Thank you so much, Tara. I-I really appreciate it. You're welcome.

The genuine article. How do you know? Because he stepped up and helped without being asked. So... what do you think? It's awesome. Bawk! What's that noise? Oh, those are the chickens. It's way past their feeding time. They're probably suffering from low-blood sugar. - Seriously? - Mm-hmm. Oh. We got company. - Oh, hey, guys! - Hi there. The boys saw you drive up and they just had to come and say hi. Hi. I'm Fletcher. This is Griffin. I'm Erin. Dad says you're like Tara's daughter, but not her daughter? Ooh... Awkward, buddy! Sorry! Kind of. It's a long story. Okay, can I help you with the luggage? - Sure. - Great. Uh... Here we go. Automatic. All right. Oh! Okay. Let me help you with one of those. They're heavy. No, no, it's fine. It's balanced this way. These both hers? Yeah. She's planning on staying a while. I hope so. What happened to the convertible? I traded it in. Didn't feel right anymore. Your dad's a real cowboy. Oh, yeah. Definitely. I'm glad, too. Or make me hang out with Bethany. It know it's hard having a new woman in your dad's life and learning to get along with her, but it will be so much better for you, if you do. I mean... you should at least try. I guess. Oh! Do you remember my friend Savannah? Yeah, of course. Well, she got a nose stud and it looks awesome. Is that right? Yeah. So... I was thinking, while I'm here, why don't I get one, too? My answer was "no" in New York, and it's "no" now, not without your dad's consent. He didn't even want you to get your ears pierced, remember? Well, Dad doesn't even care what I do anymore. Well, I do. Boone seems like a nice guy. He is. Are you guys, like, dating? No. Not really. Just friends. "Not really"? He invited us over for a barbecue this weekend. You'll get to meet some of my other new friends. - Cool. - Mm-hmm. Too lazy to walk over here and talk to me in person? I wasn't invited. I'm about to turn in. Yeah, I think I might do the same thing. She's out cold. Fell asleep as soon her head hit the pillow. Well, of course, she did. She traveled 2,000 miles today without benefit of covered wagon. Hey, what can we bring to the barbecue? I make a killer red cabbage coleslaw. Oh, yeah, bring that. That sounds fantastic. Well, um... goodnight. Goodnight. Thank you. Tara! - Hi! - Hi. I am still buzzing from that show you did at the saloon. Oh, me too. Now, how are things going with your step-daughter? News travels fast in a small town. Because we're desperate for it. We're having a great time. She's out riding with Griffin Taylor right now. Oh, good for her. Yeah. I have to admit, though, it's bittersweet having her here. Why's that? Well, she's only here because it suits my ex, James. Ah. One of those. The kind of man I like to call "Controllo". It's always their way or the highway. Yeah. That would be James. Oh, they can charm the pants off you at first, make you feel like you're the center of the universe, but once they got you hooked-- bam! ...the other shoe drops. Hmph. Yeah. I can relate. Problem is, those are the kind of guys I'm attracted to-- someone who's as strong-willed as I am. Mm. That is a problem. Still... might be nice to have a kind, considerate sweetheart to come home to. Who knows? Okay, is everyone in Parable a matchmaker? Well, we look out for our own. - - Good afternoon, ladies. I've got two-and-a-half dozen for you today, Leonard. Okay. I'll put it on your account. I'll see you later, sweetie. Okay. Try some. And... the verdict is? This rocks! You make the best coleslaw... "Tara." See? It's getting easier to say, isn't it? Not even a little bit. Now let's go meet Dawson! Nice hit, Dawson! That's my boy. Well, that wasn't very good. Not very good? That was pathetic! Boomerang. Let's try that one more time. I'm gonna help you a little bit more. - Okay. - Okay, here we go. Get a nice, smooth stroke going. That's it. And, at the top of the arc, you let it go. Here we go... - Oh! - - Oh, yeah! - Yes! - Babe. - Thank you. No problemo. Try not to burn the next ones. Okay, I never burn them! He always burns them. It looks like soccer's made its way into Parable. Not quite. Dawson tried to put a team together-- no luck. Mm. It's pretty hard to field any kind of team with a school as small as ours. Mm. And speaking of school-- I can't believe the wonders that you have worked on my boy. You know, I caught him reading under the covers the other day? The Count of Monte Cristo. Uh, you got Dawson reading? I just pointed him towards the books I thought he might like. Aw, do you think you could get Hutch to read next? Oh, then she really would be a wonder-worker. Yeah, she would be. You know, I thought about being a teacher when I was younger. Truth is, the thought of facing a room full of kids every day scared the heck out of me. Oh, it can be daunting, for sure, but when it clicks... that's the rewarding part, and that's why I do it, but it's the other stuff that drives you nuts-- the endless staff meetings, budget crunches, school-board interference. Oh, we don't have any of that here. Well, not a lot anyway. I basically am the school board. Whoa! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! It's on! This is on. - It is on! - Yep, it is on. Where are you going? Mom? So, Dawson wanted to know if I can go see the movies with him later this week? Can I? I don't see why not. All right, 'kay, listen to me, I gotta know. Know what? Have you asked her out yet? Yeah, well, we went, uh... went riding, went fishin'. Ladies like to be wined and dined, Boone. Well, sometimes, yes, but not always. Oh, now you're an expert on women? I'm just trying to get to know and understand this one. Oh, boy. You're serious about her. I guess I am. You know... she's not what you think she is, at first glance. City-slicker? Come on, guys. No, no, she's, um... She's got real heart, you know? She's got grit. And she's smart as a whip. Man, can she ride! You know, I think we used to know a woman just like that. You're right. Corrie would've liked her a lot. I think she'd be rooting for you, pal. All right, then. You guys are too soft-- too soft. Hey there. You should, uh, you should take some of these leftovers, 'cause I don't think the boys and I are gonna get through all this. - Thanks. - Yeah. I had a really nice time today, Boone. Yeah, I did, too. Come on, let's get you some more food, all right? Yeah. Can you brush my hair, like you used to? Sure. Today was fun. It sure was. You really like it here, don't you? I love it here. Don't you? I guess. What is it? When summer's over, you're coming back to New York, right? Of course, I'm coming back. You won't let Boone talk you into staying? Boone? I see the way you guys look at each other. I told you, he's... he's just a friend. Even if he does love you? He doesn't love me. Well, he's never gonna love you as much as I do. Oh. Sweetheart, you are the heart and soul of me. Nothing's ever gonna change that. Not Boone, not anyone. All right? Come here. I know you like her, Dad. Oh, do you, now? I like her, too. I don't. You like her even though she's a girl? Moms aren't girls. She's not our mom! Griff. Hey. Uh, listen, pal, you just finish brushing your teeth, okay? Get in bed. I'll come tuck you in in a minute, all right? - Okay. - Thattaboy. Wanna talk about it? Tch. Come here. Come on. You hate the idea of someone taking your mom's place. I know. I know because I have... felt that way for a very long time, myself. You see... your mom was so special. She just loved us. That's all. She plain old loved us. No ifs, ands, or buts. If we were happy, she was happy. You didn't know this, though... ...after your mom got sick, we used to have these talks-- late at night, just the two of us, after you guys went to bed. Oh, she made me laugh, talking about all the good times that we'd had. And she made me promise her that I would always keep this house full of love and fun. And she said... "Babe, don't you spend the rest of your life pining for me. You go live your life." Did she really say that? She did, bud. And she meant it, too. I didn't mean what I said before. I do like Tara. I know you do. But you don't have to worry. She's not aiming to be anybody's new mom. Not anytime soon. I'll still never forget Mom. Not ever. Attaboy. Hey! - Whoa... - - Afternoon. Um, ahem, so... just as I was congratulating myself on how on top of things I was getting, and how I was never gonna have to ask my neighbor for help for anything ever again... What's wrong? A problem with my water. Okay. Sure. Let's have a look. Oh! Hey, Boone Taylor. Are you a closet abstract expressionist? Is it that bad? Really? Ah, they look like floor plans. Yeah, I used to love doing stuff like this, you know? Coming up with an idea and then bringing it to life. Yeah. Haven't done that in a long time. We should see about that water. Okay. Show me. That was so funny. Yeah, kinda unrealistic, though. It was a movie. My favorite part was the car chase. Yeah. That was cool. Yeah. What time does Tara pick you up at? Not for a bit. Wanna get some ice cream? Yeah, sounds great. Hmm. What's the matter with it? That's a good question. Uh... Hmm. That. That is the problem. Come on. Wow. This is awesome. Yeah, I think so, but I don't really have much to compare it to. It's as good as anything I've had in New York, for sure. Wow. New York. Just the idea of it makes me nervous. It's not as scary as it looks. You always lived there? Born and raised. Wow. Same here. Uh, born and raised here, not there. Thanks for the clarification. Had me confused there. Do we fix it? Well, the pipe's gonna need to be replaced. I can talk to Joanna about that. I patched it with some plumber's tape. That ought to hold it for a while. You just happened to have plumber's tape? What kinda handyman do you take me for? Of course, I got plumber's tape. Will you show me how to do it? In case it happens again? Mm-hmm. Yeah. I can do that. We should go inside and, um, cool off. I agree. Okay, let's go. Ahem. So, uh... Boone's boys tell me that Tara's not really your mom. Well, she married my dad when I was little, so... she's more like my mom than my stepmom. It's... complicated. Yeah, they told me that, too. You know, the divorce? It's the worst. Ahh. That is so good. Mm. Here. Wash off. I'll... pour you another. Thank you. Are you sure you don't want me to wait? No. Tara's never late. Um, I'd stay, but I have chores. What? Chores. Just sounds... ...Parable? Thanks for the movie. And the ice cream. Yeah, of course. Thanks for, you know, coming along with me. Maybe we could do it again sometime? Yeah, that'd be awesome. Uh, you said something about chores? Yeah! Yeah. You're right. Chores. I'd better get to that. Well... it was really nice to see you. - Yeah. - Bye. Bye. You... you missed a spot. Oh, did I? Where? Right... right here. - Yeah? - Yeah. Any better? Little bit, yeah. Listen... I've been meaning to ask you... any more, uh... raccoon home invasions? Just the one. Good. I make sure to latch the windows. Well, you can never be too careful. Hoo... It's been a while since I've done that. Yeah. Me too. Hmm. Felt pretty good, though. Mm-hmm. Yes. It did. - Oh. - - Ahem. It's... I'm supposed to pick up Erin. Uh, she's-- she went to the movies with Dawson. Dawson's a good kid. Um, I guess I'll let you get to it, then. Yeah. Okay. Uh... I will come by later with some more plumber's tape. I'll show you how to do it. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Gotta go. Uh, Tara! - Hey! - Hi, Kendra! Hi. Hi! This is fate. I was just gonna call you. Oh? What's up? Well, one of our teachers got married in June. Oh, that's nice. Yeah, but now she's moving and we have to replace her. Are you interested? - In teaching? - Yeah. - Here? - Yes! Now, we can't pay as well as you would get paid in New York, but our cost of living is so much lower, and we have super-small class sizes, and you would have a super-supportive school board, who'd always have your back. Hmm. How much time did you spend on this pitch? Oh... It's pretty good though, right? It's good. But I have a job back in New York and-and a lease and a social life, and a daughter that I need to be near to. And endless staff meetings, budget crunches... ...painful memories. Oh, stop it! You're tempting me. Oh! I had to ask. And I appreciate it. Well, we appreciate you. You know, you have made a whole lot of friends in a real short time. You should know that. Thank you, and I... I feel the same way. Good. Well, you enjoy rest of your day. - Thank you. You too. - Thanks. I will. Think about it! Hey! Hey. Shouldn't you be out tracking rustlers and horse thieves? Ah, it's a lot of paperwork. Anyway, it's my lunchbreak and, uh... well, I really just wanted to bring you those. Oh. Wow. Thank you. They're beautiful. I was just wondering that-- you know, maybe if you... weren't busy-- I mean, obviously, you're busy, but if you weren't busy at some point, maybe you would want to go out-- with me... This is going badly! Um, I can do way better than this. Are you-- Are you asking me out on a date? Yes, ma'am. I am trying. Should we really be doing this? I don't know, I can't really think of any reason why not. The problem is, I could really fall for you, Boone. I... to be honest, I think I already have. Well, I'd be lying if I didn't say that was truly wonderful to hear. And as wonderful as it is to say, I... I don't know that I'm ready for it. Hmm. Well... I don't know. That kiss the other day felt pretty ready to me. It's not that I don't want to try, with you. I do. I'm just... I'm scared. So am I. I am very scared. Look. Why don't we just take it one date at a time? I could do that. So it's a date? It's a date. Hot dang! I'm glad you like the flowers. Me too. Okay. I'll see you soon. Okay. Tara? What is it, sweetheart? What's the matter? It's from Dad. Oh, honey, come here. It's gonna be okay. Tara, hey. You're getting married? Yeah. I am. Next week. It's-- it's kinda crazy, right? This isn't right, James. Okay, I know you're still mourning our marriage-- No, no, no, no. Don't. Don't. This isn't about us. This is about Erin. Oh! You-- Right. Look, I'm sorry to cut your little visit short, but obviously, we're not gonna get married without her here. Did it occur to you, even for a second, that sending your daughter an e-mail with this monumental piece of news might be... insensitive? Oh, come on, you know kids today. They never answer their phones. She's really upset, James. She's over-reacting! That's what 11-year-old girls do. She's 13. Okay, you know what I mean. Are you even thinking about her at all? What this means to, and for, her? You should've called her, talked to her before y-- Okay, you know what? We're not-- We're not doing this, okay? I'm not gonna argue with you about this. This is happening, okay? So just get her on that plane, like I asked you. My office will send all the info. I can't believe he's doing this. Sometimes, people get caught up in their own lives and they don't think about how their actions affect others. Not "people". Dad. I know. He could've handled this better. It's just awful. I was hoping... Hoping what? That when you came back to New York, Dad would see you and figure it's really you he loves. Oh, Erin, no. Your father and I aren't getting back together. But you love each other. We did, but things change between people, and they did with your father and me. But one thing never changed, and never will... we both love you. All I want is for us to be a family. I know. Erin, we are family. You and I will always be family. Can't I stay here with you? I really love it here. And Bethany doesn't want me! Her and Dad will send me off to boarding school. It's not my decision to make. I don't want Dad and Bethany to get married! Bethany couldn't care less about me. To her, I'm just a complication. To all of you! Erin? I made you something to eat. Erin? I'm not hungry! Honey, are you okay? I'm fine. I'll put your plate in the fridge, if you're hungry later. Boone. Hi. The boys talked me into making cookies for dessert so I thought you and Erin would like the overflow. How, um... how thoughtful. You, uh... packing up your stuff? I am so sorry, but... I'm leaving. What do you mean, leaving? I'm going back to New York. When? Tomorrow, if I can get it together. Well, when did you decide that? I'm still deciding. Things are just happening so fast. Well, what kind of things? Erin has to go back to New York to face some big life changes. I don't want her to deal with them on her own. I want to be there for her. Were you even gonna bother telling me? Of course, I was gonna tell you. I-I haven't even told Erin yet. I just decided. Like I said, I-- things are happening so fast. You said you were scared. I just... I didn't think you were this scared. This isn't about us, Boone. Well, it doesn't look like there is an "us", does it? Don't say that. I gotta get back to the boys. I'll-- I'll see you later. Boone, please. Let's talk about this. Boone? Rise and shine, sweetie! Breakfast in 10! Erin? - - Erin, honey? Erin? Erin? Hey. It's Erin. Leave a message. Erin, it's me. Where are you? Call me. - Boone. - Tara. Morning, Tara. Erin's gone. I think she ran away. I looked everywhere, and she's not picking up her phone. What makes you think she ran away? The stuff with her dad last night. She was really upset. I checked all over and she's gone. Okay, tell you what. You drive north, I'll drive south, and we'll see find her, okay? - Okay. - All right. You come with me, buddy. Hey, Griff, have you seen Erin? No, why? She's missing. I was just down at the docks and the boat's not there. The boat's not there? Yeah, I was gonna go fishing, but it's gone. Does she know how to row? - No! - Okay, come on! Let's go! Erin! Erin! Erin! Erin! Where are you? Erin! Erin... - Give you a hand. - Thank you. Erin! Erin! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. whoa. There's the boat. Tara, take the kids down that way-- there's a safer route down. I'm gonna go this way. I'll meet you there, okay? Boone? Erin. Mom! There she is! Mom! Erin! You okay? You okay? I think so. Okay. I'm gonna try and get you up. Nice and easy... there you go. I gotcha. Gonna pass you up to your mother, okay? You got her? Yeah. - Mom. - It's okay. I got you. I got you. Okay? You all right? Okay. Am I gonna get arrested? Arrested? For stealing the boat. Oh. No. Of course not. Oh, I never said I wasn't gonna arrest her. I should arrest you for being so irresponsible. And what in the world were you thinking? The map on my phone. I thought the river could take me far enough away so Dad couldn't find me. Please, don't be mad. Oh, baby, I'm not mad. I'm not mad. I'm just so grateful you're okay. I'm so sorry. It's okay. Boone. Thank you. Tara. James. Are you calling to confirm Erin's travel arrangements? No. I'm calling to let you know she's staying here with me. At least, for now. What? She was so determined not to go back to New York, that she ran away this morning. She almost drowned. Oh, come on, you can't be serious. Your daughter is in a world of pain. Right now, what she needs more than anything is a parent who's gonna love her, nurture her, catch her when she stumbles, and try to keep her from stumbling at all. Yeah, well, she's only got one parent, Tara. No. She has me, and I'm not sending her back to you, not in the state she's in. Yeah, well, that's not your choice to make. You're not her mother. Yes, I am... in every way that counts. She better be on that plane! She won't be. If you want your daughter back, James, learn how to love her. She so desperately wants you to. I do love her! Of course, I love her. She doesn't know that. How could she not? I give-- I give her everything she wants. Oh, James. You're so smart, yet... so blind. Did she really almost drown? Yes. That's... That's awful. I... She needs some time, James. And I don't expect you to come and get her. But, for right now, just let me take care of Erin. Please? Okay. Thank you. No. Thank you. And hey... tell Erin that I love her. You can tell her that, James. I will. Bye. - Hey. - Hi. You're still here. I am. Uh, forgive the regift. I meant what I said, Boone. I'm scared to death to get into a relationship again, but not if it's with you. If I let this pass me by, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. Well, I... I do appreciate that, but it's gonna be awfully hard to do, 2,000 miles away. I know. A long-distance romance... that's a... huge complication. It's a... it's a pretty big one. Which, um... ...is why I'm staying. You are? I'm taking a job here. Um... I might be teaching your boys. Really? They would love that. But... I mean, what about Erin? Doesn't she need you in New York? She's staying, too. Until James comes to his senses and becomes the father that she needs him to be. What if that doesn't happen? Then I'll be one happy mom. Well, you're a pretty good mom. You're a pretty good dad. Yeah. I try. And that's why you are. Thank you. You've... ...restored my faith in so many things. Most importantly... in this. Game on!
