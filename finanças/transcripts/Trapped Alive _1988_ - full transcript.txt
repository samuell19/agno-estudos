(Hum of conversations) (Door slams) (Door slams) (Keys rattle) (Footsteps, keys rattle) (Choking, gasping) (Wind howling) (♪ Piano playing gently) (Hum of conversation) Hi, Lucy. Oh, thank you. You're the prettiest girl at the ball. If you leave, who am I going to dance with? Oh, Papa. That's ridiculous! Anyway, Judge Colby's wife seems to have her eye on you! - You noticed that? - Uh-huh. - I did, and so did the good judge. - Oh? If you want to win cases in his court, you'd better watch out! You betcha. Listen, are you sure you want to go? Because it's getting late. Yes, I do. I can't stand you old fogeys any longer! (Horn honks) Monica's waiting. Bye, Papa. Ah, this is what you promised her. (Wind howling) - (Laughing) - (Car door shuts) (♪ Tuneless whistling) (Distant voices echoing) (Man) Shit! (Chuckling) You're coming with us, kid. We're outta here. (Man) We need him alive, shithead. He's a pro. I can drive, Face. Yeah, nails, maybe. No, what we need is a hot rod boy. - He's it. - Alright. Is your dad upset about you going to this party? No, not really. It's just that he misses Mom and he sees me... I know. He's such a sweetheart. I love working for him. Hey. We're gonna have fun, right? Right. Mm-hm. Is that new? Ooh. Not another present from Dr. Jekyll? - Oh, it is! - (Both laughing) (♪ "We Three Kings") (Wind howling) (Bird call) (Bird call response) (Different bird call) Shut up, asshole! Of all the damn luck! Do you realize, innocent child, that just five miles down the road a horde of beautiful and horny young men are panting for our bodies? For yours, maybe. I wonder if we ought to go back. It's getting really icy. - What are you doing? - Counting the cost. $60 for the hairdo, manicure ten. Then there's the dress and shoes. Say another 200! No, no. Cost of failure is too high. We must go on, Robin. We must go on. (Hot Rod) Get your hands off me. (Face) Mungo. (Mutters) "Get off me. Get off me." - You sound like this guy in New Jersey. - Get off me! He was always saying, "Get off me, get off me." Hey! He's in as deep as we are now. Don't worry about him. Ain't that right, kid? No parole for you. Shit, fuck, fuck, damn! Shit, fuck, fuck, damn! I don't know what's wrong. It usually works. Shit, fart, fuck, dumb! (Handbrake on) If this guy wants more than our help, give him an early Christmas present. (Screams) Get out! Get out! Get out of the fucking car and shut up. - Get up! - (Screaming) We're outta here! If you so much as touch us, if you hurt us, you're gonna pay for this! Shut up, you... (Screams) We've been paying all these years anyhow, ain't we, Face? We sure have, Mungo. We sure have. Now, we get some of the sweet stuff. (Women scream) (Cackling) (Radio) 'Three convicts escaped from Vilas...' - (Radio off) - I wanna hear that. Yes, boss. Right away, sir! - Punk! - (Radio on) '...police are warning not to approach these men, under any circumstances. 'They are armed and dangerous...' Hey, we're not armed! Why do they have to say things like that that ain't true? - Shut up, Mungo. - '...in a matter of hours. ""There's nowhere for them to go," he told our reporter. More on this later. 'We're expecting some snow flurries tonight with the temperature dropping close to zero. - 'Hazardous driving conditions...' - Kill the radio and let's get outta here. What a prick! The whole army couldn't put us back in there, could they, Face? Right, Mungo. (Wind howling) (Laughs) My, my, my. (Chuckles) What do we have here? I hope this means what I think it does. Because if these are in here... (Mungo, Face laugh) ...what could you be wearing? (Sobbing) No, please. No! No, please. No! (Monica sobbing) No! (Mungo) Oh, I get it! She carries the spare for emergencies! This is an emergency. - (Screams) - I ain't never killed a bitch before! (Laughs) You don't know what you've been missing. (Engine stops) Ooh. For two young bitches, you sure as hell cause a lot of trouble. Well, game's over now. We're gonna be moving along without you. This here's a kind of keepsake. Thanks, Face. (Both chuckle) Oh. (Tuts) (Mungo chuckles) What's your name, sweetheart? - Monica. - Monica. Don't. And what's yours? What's yours? It's Robin. We're just two friends going to a party. Can't you let us go? (Chuckles) There, now. Ain't I a nice guy? Gave you your last cigarette and everything, didn't I? Hey, Face. Hey, hey, Face. There's lights up ahead. Hey, looks like they're setting up a roadblock. So, get us outta here, asshole! There's a track over here on the right, can you see it? Yeah. Yeah, I got it. Stay on it. Find a place to hole up until their balls freeze off. We got some unfinished business, ain't we, girls? But it'll keep for a while. (Snoring) (Vehicle approaching) Stay on the track, asshole! You're gonna get us stuck in the goddamn snow! Lay off me, Face. I know what I'm doing! The track goes over here. Do you hear me? You need to listen to me. You stay on my fucking track! (Whispers) Asshole. - (Women scream) - Shit! - (Creaking) - Shut up! (Cracking) It's like an old mineshaft or something. Don't anybody move. - What's the plan, Face? - Shut up, you dumb shit! You got no cause to cuss me out. I don't gotta stay any place I ain't welcome. - Sit down! - (Women scream) (Snoring) (Clock ticking) (Groaning) (Coughing) Get out of there. Get out! It's gonna blow any second. (Groaning) Where's your friend? Where's your friend, Robin? Face, is she in there? Where's the other girl, the blonde girl? (Face) She's dead meat, Romeo. - Dead meat! - Shit! Robin? Robin? Get down, for Christ's sake! - 3-71. - (Radio crackles) Got a possible 10-70, county road H. By the old mine. I'm investigating. (Radio crackles) (Hum of conversation) Merry Christmas, John. Merry Christmas. Dear friends, thank you all for being with me here tonight. And I wish you love and peace and happiness. (All) Love, peace, happiness! (Laughter) And to my absent friends. (Wind howling) (Snoring) (Coughing, spluttering) I reckon this one's yours, hero. You... You owe him, sweetheart. Don't look so good for Mungo, Face. Don't look like he's gonna make it. We've been cellmates for three years. I never lost my temper with him until today. - (Wood creaking) - Stupid lummox. (Screaming) (Screaming continues) (Distant rumbling) - 3-71? - (Radio crackles) - 3-71? - (Radio crackles) - Vilas control. Do you read? - (Radio crackles) - 10-1, Vilas control? - (Radio crackles) 10-1, Josie, goddammit! (Radio crackles) (Engine stops) (Groaning) (Whimpering) Mungo? Where are you? (Whimpering) I... I can stay right where I fell. (Moans) (Whisper) Asshole. Face? (Faintly) Yeah. OK. Anybody else alive? - (Cries out) - Robin? Monica, where are you? Something touched me. Oh, God! Where's Robin? - (Robin) I'm here. - Are you hurt? No. I just got the wind knocked out of me. I can't see! Something's moving around me. Hasn't anyone got a goddamn light? (Screams) Something touched me over there. You've gotta believe me! Robin? Where are you? I can't see you. Come into the light. What took you so long with the flashlight, dumbass? Check on Mungo! Me, I'm gettin' outta here! You stay here and wait for the cops, if you want, scumbag. Wait, you gonna follow me? There's another way out of this, you know, and I'm gonna find it! Oh, yeah. - And I'm gonna take this one along. - (Screams) Hey, we have a big stretch limo waiting up here, Hot Rod. And we need a driver. Yes, ma'am, I realize I'm in Parson's County. But it's only five miles! I'm sorry, operator, I didn't mean to shout. I'm having a hard time hearing you. - Yes, it's bad here, too. - (Wind howling outside) If you could just try it one more time, please. Thank you. Yes, it's official. Deputy Williams, Vilas County. Thank you. Ma'am, I apologize. It's bad everywhere ton... Yes. Yes, you can. At the Forever Mine. Thank you. I really do apologize for the inconvenience, ma'am. We had a breakout. Sheriff's madder than hell. How did she know where to call me back? Oh, everybody knows everybody's business in this county, Officer. - Do you like your coffee strong? - Sure do, ma'am. The operator's gonna call me back if she does get through to headquarters. Oh, that's fine. Could I call you by your first name, Officer? Yes, ma'am. Well? Oh. (Chuckles) Billy Williams. My given name is William Williams, but most people find that a bit of a mouthful, so they call me Billy. Well, Billy, looking at you, it's hard to imagine anyone having any complaints. - (Clears throat) - I baked these myself. I have a lot of time for things like that. Delicious. Oh, you like it? I don't know if this has anything to do with the jail break, but I heard something outside - or I felt something move, you know? - Like the earth moved? - Yeah. Something like that. Did you feel it, too? Not yet! No. No, not this evening, but the old mine moves all the time. Billy? Come here. I want to show you something. Me and my daddy. In the good old days. This was the pay office then. I'd come here every Friday and meet him. He'd give me his pay check to take home to Momma. He was... a very fine man, Billy. I miss him. (Cries) I wonder what's on the other side of the gate. You got me by the balls. (Straining) You know, I bet you, if we could get through here we'd be home free, man. We're trapped. - (Slow clap) - (Monica) Bravo! They do teach you something in prison! You shut your fucking mouth, bitch! Ain't no fucking way I'm gonna be buried alive. And I sure as hell ain't gonna do any time in here! This is bad shit. This is bad shit! You touch me! You fucking touch me and I'll blow all three of you away right now! (Deep rumbling) (Bed rattling) (Snoring) What is it, Mr. Deputy Sheriff? I don't know. I felt something move. It's nothing. It's nothing. - Were you asleep? - No. Just listening to His Master's Voice! - Does it turn you on? - No! Billy... You ever been down in a mine? Would it turn me on? Well... It's like this. (Kiss) You go down. (Kiss) Down. Until you find the shaft. And then you... (Rumbling) (Creaking) Oh, yeah. Here, let me see that. Yeah. We'll get light any second now. - That's good. - All right. Most of these are no good. Oh. Hey, kid. What we got over here, an electric motor or something? Even better. It's an old genny. You know those lights along the wall out there? If we could get this thing started... Hm. It's gonna need some work, though. I gotta light a lamp so I can work. Who's got a match? Oh, man! Wait a minute. Your slimeball friend here gave Mungo my lighter in the car, remember? Oh, that's right. The lighter's probably still in his pocket. We gotta go get it. Correction, bonehead. You gotta go get it. And as for you, if you ain't got something nice to say, then shut the fuck up! Now, now, me and the girls are gonna sit right down up against the wall and we're gonna wait for you to come back. What's wrong, kid? Don't you trust me? Get the fuck out of here. (Face laughing) (Mine rumbling, creaking) (Face) Now, isn't this nice and cozy? (Rattling) OK, little bitches. Time to go off now and light the rest of the lamps. You let him go out there alone when you had those matches all the time! Oh, honey, I'm sorry. I... I didn't know I had them. - Now you go ahead and help her, OK? - You lying son of a bitch! Oh. (Laughs) Son of a bitch! Me a son of a bitch? Dumb broad, I'm the only one here who can get us out alive. She knows that. Huh? Now, you're just gonna have to stay in here and get your head straight! (Laughs) Get outta here. (Laughing) (Door creaking) Oil lamp on the floor, honey. (Gasping) (Sobbing) Let me out! (Robin sobbing, screaming) (Ringing) (Robin, sobbing) 'Let me out! - 'Please, let me out!' - Hello? 'Let me out! Please!' Shit! (Robin crying) (Distant growling) OK. Oh, man! Shit! Oh, God! All the world is a stage, and all the men and women merely players. Ha! We have our exits. And entrances. Surprised you, didn't I? It's amazing what men do when they lock them up. A lot of thinking and pricking. But you know what I mean. Oh, yes, you do. - (Rumbling) - Hear the music, girl? Makes you wanna dance. Dance for me. Twirl for Daddy! Move your ass. Wiggle your ass. Come on. No. No! No! No! Slowly! Slowly. Like this. Huh? (Face panting) Now, you hear the music. Strip for Daddy. What's keeping you, girl? Do it. Do it now! (Face moaning) (He cries out) It's showtime. Jeez Louise! Which one are you? What's your name? Uh, Carter. Randolph Carter. Up. Come on. Now, very slowly, point the light at your face. - Why? - Do it. - What for? - Just do it! Now, who's this poor son of a bitch? It's Mungo. And what about the other one, Louis Napoleon? Up ahead with the girls. Right, tell me about the girls. Well, they were in the car when we grabbed it. Anybody else hurt? Not yet, no. Fine. Let's you and me go surprise your friend. Nice and quiet now. And no tricks. He's got a gun. (Gunshot) What you doing, you son of a bitch? You'll bury us alive! Shut your mouth! - Get on your feet. - (Spits) Now! (Laughs) - Get those hands up. - Ooh. Both hands up and we can settle this right now. - (Laughing) - Miss? Come over here behind me. She's a little upset cos she didn't get to finish what she started! (Laughs) Do you want me to put it away for you? Oh. Carter? Cuff your friend to those bars behind him. Put the first cuff on his right wrist. Right, now take it back through the bars. No, all the way over to the left. - What did you do with Robin? - Robin? Oh, Robin was my little bitch. OK, Carter, that's enough. Miss, is there someone else? Yes, Robin. She's in there. Oh, thank God! Go to your friend, please, Miss. OK. Let's take a look-see. Maybe we can get some light down here. I was gonna fix it. Get to work, mister. How am I gonna work with one hand? Miss? Miss, could you please come over here and light this lamp? I'll hold the flashlight for you. Give the punk a hand, if he thinks he needs it. I'm gonna go out there and see if I can find a way out of here. There's no way out now you blocked the tunnel. Shut up, punk! When I need your advice, I'll ask for it. Psst! (Whistles) (Whispers) Fancy a blow job? Huh? We got time. Ooh, shake it but don't break it. Wrap it up and I'll take it. (Laughs) Come on over here, give me some of that sweet stuff. Just give me a reason. Shove it! So, are you upset about being caught? Not about getting caught, no. What, then? You remember when we landed in a heap in the sand back there? Sure, in the shaft? Yeah. Monica screamed and said she was being touched by something in the dark, right? - Yeah, but... - Yeah, well, listen. She was right by Mungo's body. None of us was anywhere near her. She said she felt something move. But I thought there was something in here trying to get me, but there wasn't. Yeah, maybe there wasn't. (Growling) What, are you lost, Boy Scout? (Growling) So, uh... Have you ever worked on one of these before? A couple of times. That's why they call you Hot Rod, right, cos you're good with engines and things? - Partly. - Why else? And because I hotwire cars and race them, crash them, demolish them. You name it, if it runs on wheels, I drive it. - Hot Rod! - What's your real name? Uh... Randolph Carter. Randy! I like Randy. Randy and Robin, it sort of has a nice ring to it, don't you think? Well, I'm not used to being called Randy. My father used to call me Randolph. The guys at school called me Carter. My mother never called me much of anything. So... You were in the pen at Vilas, weren't you? I know all about that place. My father's an attorney. Oh... His clients end up there sometimes, even after they've paid. He represents murderers. Anyone, I... Damn. It's really important for me to know why you were in jail. Look, will you lay off me, OK? I don't really feel like being interrogated right now. Does it look to you like I might possibly have enough problems on my hands already? Well, fuck you! I am sorry that I even tried to care about your... No, fuck you! Because Mungo's body is laying back there half-eaten. Your daddy's not down here to get you out of this, do you understand that? His face is gone. His guts are ripped out. Listen, don't worry about it, OK? It's probably... It's probably just rats or something. So... So, it's kind of important for you to know why I'm in jail, huh? Yeah. Well, I'm a hot rod, remember. I drive people around, where they want to go. You mean criminals? Gangsters? Yeah, right, gangsters. Well, this was just a small job. I mean, you know, only worth a grand. Just get in the car, go there, grab the money, run. Done in five seconds, you know. We got there right on the button and the security guards were crossing the sidewalk with the first delivery. What happened? Well, one of the security guards started chasing us. I don't know, he must have been some kind of running freak or something. Anyway, Face pulls out this gun from nowhere and starts shooting at him. Face? You knew him before? Well, that's the first time I ever met him. He said no guns, you know? He said no guns, just a simple grab and run, planned to perfection. Yeah, right. So, um... So, he hits the guy, you know? He hits the security guard right between the eyes and... And then what? And then he hits this little kid. Who just, you know... happened to be in the way. That moment will be with me as long as I live. Face and the other guy went down for 30 years apiece. And you? Well, the judge believed that I didn't know about the gun, so he just gave me eight years. Time to straighten myself out, he said. For good conduct, out in four. This breakout is going to put me in for another eight. At least. I just don't understand why you took the risk. (Generator starts) Well! Looks like you do know how to do something right. We're not all perfect, Officer. No, we don't all have your background and education, Miss Adams, but at least some of us know the difference between right and wrong. How do you know my name? I see you at the courthouse when you come to see Daddy. - Has my father reported me missing? - Oh, he might have. - But I heard you screaming on this. - What? The line goes up to the old mine office on the surface. Is anyone up there? (Machinery ratcheting) (Monica screams) (Screaming) (Screaming) The cuffs! Get the cuffs off. (Screaming) (Screaming continues) (Face) Help! - What's happening? - (Screaming) Robin? Are you all right? (Screaming) (Gunshots) (Growls) (Ratcheting) (Face whimpering) Let me outta here. Let me outta here now, do you hear me? Let me outta here! I don't know what just happened out there, mister. One thing I do know for sure, you're my prisoner. Nothing can change that. Yeah. Look, nothing can change whatever it is that happened to Face and Mungo. But if we don't pull together, the same thing's gonna happen to us. Please let him go! Please! We're going to die here otherwise. You can't let that happen. He's my prisoner, Miss Adams. Nobody's gonna tell me what I should do with him. Sit down. We are not gonna die here. - I'll see to it. - Oh, like you did with Face, huh? Listen, whatever it was did society a favor. - I know about his ex-partner... - He was not his partner. He was a child-killer, all right? Like him. But you're not the judge or the jury, are you, Officer? No, ma'am, and I wouldn't want to be. I'm not even smart enough. That's why we have rules and regulations and procedures. This is a procedure. The prisoner stays handcuffed. (Clock ticking) (Billy) I want everybody to stay calm. I don't think we're in immediate danger, as long as you don't panic. I'm gonna go in there and try that telephone one more time. Don't worry. I'll reach somebody this time. Hello. Hello? Ma'am, if you can hear me, call the Vilas County sheriff's department. - (Snoring) - (Woman) Hello! - 'Hello?' - Is anybody there? Is anybody there? (Laughing) Nobody's home! Can you hear me? (Randy) What's your name, Officer? Or maybe they only let you have a number. I don't want trash like you calling me by name. You wanna call me something, call me sir. Oh, so... So that's it. I'm trash and you're golden? You know, I don't need you to tell me what it is I did wrong, sir, or that I deserve what I got for it. You don't have anything straight in your mind, do you? I mean, you're just all tin badge and bullshit procedures and I guess you're really just too stupid to deal with what's happening here. Do you feel better now? You don't have to take her crap, mister. She knows nothing! - Spoiled little rich brat. - Monica, no! (Monica) Shut up, little girl! While you were sitting around safe back there, I had one of those scumbags drooling all over me! - Monica, there was nothing I could do. - Oh, no? I was almost raped, Miss Goody-two-shoes! I despise convicts. Thank you for the use of your coat. - You're welcome. - You must be an officer... - and a gentleman. - Wait, you...! Wait a minute! You just said you despise convicts. What's this? You don't know how to tell good guys from bad guys. (Monica) I do. Now, give her the keys and don't mess with her. She's a regular Miss Annie Oakley. (Gun clicks) Miss Adams, what is your daddy gonna think when this all comes out in court? I mean, I can see you've got feelings for the kid. You'd better give me the gun. I'll forget about it. (Gunshot) I may not hit what I aim for next time, Officer. I'm just interested in one thing, Miss Adams. How did he get you to pull a stunt like this? No, let me guess. He's real sorry for what he did. The judge wanted to give him some time to straighten up, right? He'd get parole for good behavior, right? So, why escape? Of course! Forced to break out with the really bad guys, like Louis Napoleon and that other freak out in the gallery. Am I close? Was it the truth? It's your call. Robin, call it right, or you could be killing me just as sure as if you pulled that trigger right now. What do you want me to do, huh? You want me to shoot you? Prove you right about me being a no-good punk. Trash. - Those other two are killers. - Does that make me a killer? I guess not. (Ticking) (Gentle snoring) (Radio) '3-71, this is Vilas control. Come in, please. 'Repeat. 3-71, this is Vilas control. Come in, please.' (Wind howling) 'Billy, wake up, you dopey son-of-a...' (Straining) - Can you get the pipe in there? - Just a little more. You're done. Here. Take this. - Do we need a lamp? - Uh, no. We got a flashlight. (Robin) Hurry up, Monica. - Come on. - Here, give me that. Argh! Pull him out! Pull him out! (Groaning) Pull it higher. Come on! Don't leave me. Please don't leave me here! Don't worry. We're not gonna leave you. Monica, everything will be OK. (Growling) Come on! (Screams) - No! - Please! Great. One left. Please! (Sobbing) Please! (Gunshot) (Growling) (Sobbing) (Machinery ratcheting) (Robin sobbing) (Randy) It's OK. No! All right, let's go. (Groans) (Cries out) Oh, Robin. Get my flashlight. (Wind howling) (Chiming) (Groans) What? Hello? Is this Tom Pardu? Oh, please forgive me. I woke you up. I'm Lucy Adams' father. You probably... probably know her as Robin. Tom, could you tell me what time she and Monica left the party? What? (Man) 'Hello? Hello? 'Mr. Adams? Hello, Mr. Adams. Are you still there? 'Mr. Adams? Hello...' Hello. Sheriff's office? This is John Adams. Deputy Mullins? Pete? Oh, Pete, I'm glad you're there. I want to report my daughter missing. Oh, wait a minute. She left here to go to a party last night. She went with Monica Perry, my assistant. They never arrived. No, I know this may sound silly. I have this feeling. She would have called! My daughter would have called. Please humor an old man, Pete. Yes. I'll wait here for you. Oh, God. Oh, God. (♪ Music box plays melody) I miss you, Nan. But don't worry. It'll be all right. Hm. We'll find her. Probably took the wrong road or broke down or... They've found shelter somewhere. You always said she's very lucky she was born with my brains and your good sense. Remember? Together, you always said she'd see her way out of any situation. With my brains and your... courage. Oh, God. I miss you, Nan. I miss that courage. Especially now. She's all I have. I'm scared. I'm so scared. I... hope I haven't betrayed you, Nan. - (♪ Music box stops) - I... (Knock on door) (Knocking) (Groans) Here. (Cries out) Here we go again. Another goddamn trap. (Water dripping) Maybe not. These rungs must lead somewhere. I can't swim. (Billy groans) Well, he's not going anywhere until we look at that ankle. (Screams) (Groans) (Groaning) I'm going down. Robin, no. This is no... (Both)...job for a woman. Randy, this may be our last chance. Take the flashlight. It's waterproof. - How's that leg? - Hurts like hell. Guess that's something else you know how to do, Carter. (Chuckles) Your jokes are killing me, man. How long's she been under? About a minute. How long can somebody hold their breath underwater? Depends. Usually, about two minutes. One time we fished a kid out from under the ice. He'd been there longer than ten minutes. Saved his ass. How long's it been now? About 30 seconds longer than the last time you asked. I'm going in after her. She's in trouble. You'll be a lot of help. Give me a hand. (Groans) Hey, here she comes now. Shit! I found another passageway. What happened? Where's Randy? It's, uh... that thing. - Underwater? He can't even swim! - Wait a minute. - There's nothing you can do for him now. - No! Randy! (Roars) - Randy. - (Choking, spluttering) - What...? What happened? - Are you all right? - Huh? - We got him! - Yeah? - She got him! (Screams) (Woman) Congratulations! (Sobbing) You've killed my father! Why? He was a good man. He was... He was proud and hard-working. 15 years down this mine to put food on our table. 15 years! And then the accident, you know back there where you were hiding? 18 men buried alive. Buried too deep, they said. Buried just a little too fucking deep to even try to get them out! Should have been drowned, with all the water pouring in. My daddy! He was the best man in the whole mine! Really he was, everybody said so, not just me. After Momma died, I stayed on. Where was I gonna go? Then I married my wonderful husband. (Laughs) I became the caretaker's wife. But... I never really gave up hope that my father was still alive. You know? Somehow, inside me, I would hear this voice that would say, "He's alive." "He's alive! Daddy's alive because he's too strong to die!" So then I knew I would have to start looking for a way in. And I did, but I couldn't find one at first, cause all the main shafts were blocked. But then I found this! Yeah! And then, I learned the mine. I learned how to listen in the dark. For the slightest little whisper. And I found him. In the end, I found him. I did! Me! (Laughs) But... But people... they would never understand what he had become, you know, to survive. They... They just couldn't. So, I tried... Well, I guess that doesn't really matter anymore, does it? Because Daddy's dead. My daddy is dead. (Wails) But I guess we are, too. Cause you know what? I knew this would happen someday. So, I made a tomb, see? See? It just needs this little fuse to set the whole thing off. And then we can be at peace. Forever. With Daddy. OK? OK. I never did find out your name. Oh. I'm Rachel. God, you're beautiful, Rachel. What a beautiful woman. I'm so glad I got to meet you... ...love you. - I've just gotta touch you. - Don't try to trick me, Billy. You can't stop me now! How could I stop you? I've got a broken ankle. Look! Go ahead, Rachel. Look. (Screams) Get outta here! Go on! Get her out of here! This must be how she got in. Come on. Come on! Shh, Billy. Shh.
