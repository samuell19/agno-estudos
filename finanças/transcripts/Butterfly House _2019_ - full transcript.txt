Hey! Gil Le! Long time no see. Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! - How’s it going? - Very well. You look so beautiful. Plastic surgery, right? Stop teasing me. Have fun! - What? - How are you? - Hi Chef! How’s your restaurant going? - Thriving. - Thriving. - Drop by sometime. - There are many new dishes. - Okay! Let’s cheers! - Cheers. - Cheers. Nice to meet you! Here is the King of Facebook. - How’s Facebook? - It’s just been hacked. Serves you right! Sir, we need you at the VIP table. Just send them our best bottle. Where’s Han? Stop this crap! Let’s rock the show first. Do you know how the queen died? - Why? - She was betrayed. Han! Han! Open the door! I won’t! Hey! Tell you what, - if you open… I’ll call the police. - Han! Open the door! You’d better lock the door for me. Han! You’re so unreasonable. Huh? You’re… Put the bras on! Stay still! Do you want to die? Do you know the audience is waiting? See! Gotcha! - See! Hey, Dom Dom! Hear that! - Hear what? Since he talked to me, there is not a single word about me. Why is that? You don’t even care about me. You don’t care if I'm happy or upset, or what I want and desire. You only care about your troupe. You only care about your show. You’re afraid of losing money if the show fails, right? I’m out. I know that I’m out. Hey! Listen to me! - Ouch! - What are you doing? What am I doing? Huh? See! See! I know you’re fed up with me. You’re sick of seeing my old gay face, aren’t you? That’s why you’re flirting around. You want to hunt all the bunnies out there, right? What? What bunnies? Your young loverboy! Such irrational jealousy! Gosh, Cuong! Mrs. Han is up next. Send Minh Ha up, okay? - Okay! Do it! - Stop right there! What have you just said? Huh? - Who is going to replace me? - Get! - That’s how you treat me? Huh? - Get Minh Ha! - No way! No! - Yes! - What now? - Stop it! - I’ll sing. - Shut up! Taking advantage, huh? I’ll slap your face so hard you can’t sing. Listen to me! I’ll sing. I’ll do it. The audience comes here because they love me. They are here because they want to see me, the talented Ho Ngoc Han. So, I’ll perform for my beloved audience. Not for you. Okay! Dom! Have the DJ play something - to fill the time. - You think I’m old? I'm going crazy any day now. Just need to put on some powder to look bright and young. What? Why drag me? - Come! - What are you doing? - You'll hit me? - Come! You want to hit your wife? Want to hit a woman? - I’ll call the police. - Stop it! Let me go! My God! Dom! Why are you dressed like a lunatic? Some drag bar owner you are! It’s called Geisha makeup. What? Geisha makeup? You’re so brave. You have the nerve to use Han’s makeup stuff? Even her wig. Take it off. Otherwise you’re done with her. Dare you to tell her! If you do that, don’t be surprised when I sell you out. I’ll tell her about your affair when she’s away. Scared, aren’t you? I knew it. Just kidding. Don’t worry, I won’t tell her if… you give me a chance to be the main vocal of the show. I knew it! You really want to sing. Fine! I’ll give it to you. Three words. Never never never! Okay? That’s four. Nobody’s home today? No one. There’s something, well... It's hard to tell you. Madam! Is it diarrhea? No doubt, if you run that fast. Why did you stop following me? Honey! Listen up! Hey... Our son has just come home. He just got in? You... I’m sorry, my darling. - How much for this one? - $75. - What? Too expensive! - Sorry, sir. I can't tell if you’re a boy or girl. I'll just say "you," OK? Oh my God! Is that fake gold? What kind of fake? The top-notch one. With a little money, I’ll have something special for you. Here it is! LV handbag with Chanel logo. Okay? - How can you tell? - Let me tell you... If you love wearing gold, wear the real thing. You can get a reaction from fake gold. Better use top-notch fake stuff than be some rich kid wannabe, right? I only tell you out of love and because we're like sisters. - Discount, please! - $60. - I won’t buy it. - $40. - Thanks. - Uh-uh. Tell you what, I’ve been practicing how to bargain. I won't actually buy. Bastard! My dear colleagues. It’s time for me to step down. I’m satisfied with what I gave to this school over the past years. No matter who the new principal is, I hope they will contribute their best to this school. Thank you very much. I can’t take it. If I am elected, I’m not sure I’m good enough to accomplish such an important mission. I know you’re the most suitable to take over my position. Anyway, I’ll support you with all my heart. Thank you. People work out for six-packs. You also work out really hard. But for just a one-pack. What did you say? Huh? Say what? Tell you what. You! You just keep breathing in and out. While I’m breathless over here. - What do I do wrong in this house? - Nothing. You do everything right. Except one thing. - What’s that? - Breathing. Oh my gosh! You mean I should die? No! I just want you to hold your breath. You know why this flower was in my mouth? - Why? - To avoid karma. Shut up! - You and your big mouth. - Honey! Our son is sleeping soundly. Do not wake him up, okay? Dear God! - Huh? - Why are you wearing so many rings? Take some off. So gay! Why didn't you tell me he’s home? I’m sick of your attitude. Move away! Stop watching these things while doing housework. - Clean this up! - I’m arranging flowers. I can tell. I really buy you as a mom. Even I want to be your child. Oh my God! You wish! If I could bear a child, I would never bear you. I have to admit this is quite something, the queen goes to the market herself. Of course. I’m the only one to take good care of Hoang. Don’t even think of touching him! Hey! Listen up! I have to be the one to wash Hoang’s clothes. I dare you to touch his clothes and sniff them. Oh my God! Gross! Madam! I already had them all taken out. "Them?" Drag queen performers! It was their last show last night. Oh no! Jesus! Honey! I told you. See? Why did you pay them all that early? You have to wait until we find the new ones. How about the next two shows? Gosh! How can we manage? Who can replace them now? Oh my God! Jesus! Really? Unbelievable! Crazy! Honey! Why do you look so anxious? You don’t even answer my questions. Hoang is getting married. - What? - What? Dad! I want to get married. So, you’re straight. Think I’m like you? You! - Dad, here's the thing. - What? She’s from Hanoi. She really loves me. We met last year while in college in America. She’s... Pretty. Smart. Courteous. I’m sure you’ll like her. Is that true? Oh gosh! I'm so happy. Tell you what. To be honest, I love having a daughter-in-law from Hanoi. Why not from the Mekong Delta? Hanoi is too far away. Oh my gosh! Even an in-law from the Mekong Delta isn't for you. Excuse me! I'll be a vedette. You’re gonna regret it! Wow! I’ll be reincarnated by then. Soon! - Haven’t had breakfast yet? - Come on, honey! You want this flip-flop? Stop! Honey! Then what? Did he mention any timeline? - What do you think? - What's there to think? Our son is getting married and we're happy. If I have a daughter-in-law, I’ll teach her to be a good housewife. I don’t agree. Hoang is too young to get married. Are you still hungry? You want to eat another flip-flop, don’t you? Hey! No need to think too much, okay? I’m fine with that. I agree. Forget it! No marriage at this age. Understand? Dad, if you don’t allow me to get married next year, I never will. Where is he from? How did you meet him? We met when we were in the US. His name's Hoang. He’s lovely, Mom. I can’t understand kids these days. They care nothing at all about studying... just love. The sooner they get married, the faster they get divorced. It's going nowhere. Dad is right. There are many types of boyfriend. But there’s only this kind of husband. Strict and serious like this. Choose someone living nearby. Marry someone far away and things go wrong, how can I protect you? Mom, distance doesn’t matter. Hoang’s family is kind and decent. - They're all artists. - What? Artists? What kind of artists? Are they full-time or freelancers? His dad is a stage director, and his mom... well, his mom is... Why does it take you so long? - Is what? - A folk music singer. Everyone in his family is an artist. Hey, hey. Never, ever get involved in showbiz. They're all troubled. Dad! - What's going on? - Alright. He told me everything. Auntie. Auntie! It’s for you. God! Honey, he gave me a present. Wipe your mouth! He's our family treasure. Unbelievable, girl! Honey! Look! Kiddo... You don’t have much. Why waste it on this? I had a job back there. No no. I like it. It’s just, you don’t know my style. I’ve never taken such a thing out with me before. Well, you can bring it on stage with you. I can use it! Go away! Thank you, my dear. Yes. Hey, hey! Stop worrying about your marriage. It’s not good for your health. I’ll handle the wedding. Yes! Dad! His family are esteemed artists. They're not like the showbiz kids these days. You’re hurting me. Honey, if that's the case I think an artist is a good thing. Look at you! A lit teacher shouldn't be so stiff. Thank God your voice is sweet. As long as they love each other then it’s fine. But... Sorry! I have to answer the call. Hello, babe! It’s me. My parents have already agreed. Let’s arrange a family meeting. Focus. Lady in red, do you know how to form a line? You're gay, but try to form a straight line. Get back! Let the audition officially… begin! Meat pie. - Meat pie. - No. Here comes the final result. - Me? Is it me? - Behind you. You! You! And you. Hey, hey! Miss! Miss! You said you needed four. Why did you stop at three? Are you scamming us? Are you questioning me? - See, I’m the fourth. - What? - Dismissed! - What? - What? What? - Hold on. What was that? Hang on, guys! Listen! Stay right where you are. How dare you! Stay away! Ladies. Please be quiet! I don’t like noise, okay? Well. I’m the official judge here. Hi. They won’t be here until tomorrow. What are you so anxious about? Everything. This is not simple. What problem? It’s Mai’s family. They are extremely traditional Hanoians. Mai’s father is a vice-principal of a well-known high school. He’s a qualified candidate for the principal position. He has to maintain his image. That’s why Mai lied to them. Mai told them that my Dad was a stage director and my Mom was a folk music singer. Oh my God. So they think Auntie Han is your mom? Mai had to tell lies. Also, I think… I think Mai’s family may not like gay people. OK. Don’t like gays. So you want me to do this. Close the bar, pretend to enjoy my retirement with fish tanks and bonsai, right? OK. Let’s assume that I do it. Then how about Auntie Han? What are you up to? About Auntie Han. Can we tell her to travel somewhere for a few days? Are you insane? Being a drag queen is a serious job. It’s a kind of art. People come here to admire an amazing work of art. Let them respect you. And if you want respect from other people, you have to respect yourself and your work first. - Okay? - Yes. Thank you. That’s why I need your help. Just for one night only. Or else… the meeting would be ruined. Dad! You also have to change. What about me? Yes. I wear make up. I live with a man. I’m gay. I’m gay. But I have my pride. I spent all of my youth struggling to get to where I am today. For the record, no one can tell me what to do. I don’t give a damn. Dad. Mom. Hoang’s family want to meet us. Who agreed to that? Huh? Dad is right. Let us take care of his promotion first. You can wait. Mai, after getting your diploma and getting a good job, - then build a family. - Dad’s right. Honey, all my life I’ve never counted on your vice-principal’s salary. Things you want for the school, you can do it now as the principal. You deserve to be the new principal. - I’m pregnant. - Talk about that later. - What? - What? What should we do now? If everyone finds out, - I’ll have to resign. - Resign what? Don’t be negative! Let me think. If we allow them to get married now, it’ll be too easy. But if we hesitate, when her belly gets bigger… Then we will humiliate ourselves. So... Honey, I have an idea. I'll call you if anything comes up. I want you to come to Saigon. Bring me the evidence. I think my pregnancy is enough. You don’t have to force your dad. I know. It's kind of messy here. Let’s change the subject. Do you miss me? Of course I do. I’m dying here. I miss you, too. Miss you a lot. Then send me some pictures. No, you do it first. Wait a minute. Dom Dom! Please help me redecorate this room within the afternoon. For the in-laws? - Yes. - Why didn’t you tell me? I feel like I’m invisible in this house. Just do it. Ready. Go. One, two, three, four, five, six. You need to relieve the shoulders. You too. Do the right side first. Just hang it there. Okay. Hang it up. Don't add, just remove. - Honey! - Yes? You’re so weird today. You even want to have a picnic. Weird. I’m totally weird. No, really, we're just cooped up in the house all day, and it feels like we’re in prison. Also, you look a little pale lately. So, I just want us to have some fresh air. That’s all. - Hey! - What? What did you say about me? You said I looked pale. What do you mean? No. Nothing. You’re still pretty. - Are you saying that I’m old? - No. I wouldn't dare. Admit it. No. You’re not old at all. I mean it. Watch your words! - What’s that? - Unknown message. - From whom? - A friend. Male or female? Why do you want to know? - Male or female? - Are you jealous? We’re too old to get jealous. - Mind your manners. - What? People are looking at us. - Jealous! - Mind your manners. Stop it. People are looking at us. - Who cares? - Stop it. - Oh my god! - What’s wrong? - Oh, shit. - What? - I have to go back home. - What’s wrong? I forget the appointment with the tailor for the wedding. Hey, don’t! Don’t! Honey, please don’t! Honey! Honey! Honey, honey, don’t have it made. We can go shopping for it. No. No ready-made clothes. They won’t perfectly suit me. Gosh! You walk so gay. God! Listen to me. I’ll take you to the best tailor in Saigon. Nonsense! This is my tailor, I’m not switching. I forgot. You still have plenty of clothes at home. Plus, you’re beautiful. You always look good. Honey! I know I’m beautiful. But it’s our son’s wedding. I want to be super gorgeous. - Hey, hey. - What? You’re acting very strange today. - What? - Please, step away. I have plenty to do. Book the restaurant, wedding cards, the guest list. I have to go. Hey! Hey! You dropped something! Gosh! That's so convincing! Stop fooling around. We have plenty to do. Oh my God! Oh my God! Honey! Honey! What happened? Our house has been ransacked. Where’s everyone? Everything has been stolen. Hoang, how could you know nothing? - I... - What? Calm down, Auntie! Calm down! I promise when you come back, everything will be the same as before. What are you talking about? Come back from where? Honey! Hoang’s girlfriend, Mai, and her family will visit us tonight. I think that... you should go somewhere else. I see. Hence the redecoration. Just for one night only. I’m fine, kiddo. I understand. I... just feel... I just feel a bit hurt. Betrayed. Honey. Listen to me, honey! Please! I’m heartbroken now. I can’t believe that’s how you two treat me. Honey, please don’t cry. People are staring. I’ll cry whenever I want to. I don’t care about others. Alright, alright. You’ll stay. I promise. I promise. I will never trust you again. How can I go back when nobody wants me there? What’s wrong? - What’s wrong with you? - I can’t breathe. Let's go! Go! Go! Let’s get in here. I’m dead already. Who’s dead? Honey, you don't ever die. Do not call me "honey" here! You want anything? As usual. What? Sweet soup? Mind your manners. Can I have... two black coffees with ice? - Less sugar, please. - Certainly. Honey, calm down. Don’t be like that! Hoang knows you raised him since he was just a kid. He really loves you. He loves you so much. Does he really love me? Yes. It's... It's my fault... for not telling you in advance. Forgive me and our son, please. But honey, honestly... I want to be there for him. Don’t ask me to leave, please. Actually, I overreacted a bit back there. It's ridiculous to introduce me as his mom the first time the two families meet. Honey, can I be there with him as his uncle? I'm still male on my birth certificate, anyway. Please? - Uncle? - Yes. - Is that okay? - Of course! I can act straight. - No, you can’t. - Yes! - It's too obvious! - Nobody knows. - Too obvious! - No, it isn't! - Yes, it's… - No! No! I'm straight. Thanks. Mind your business. There, there, look at your eyes. Hey, I'm telling you, you can hide anything but your eyes. Oh my gosh! How can my brother look at me like he wants to undress me? - Then what should we do? - Let me see. - See that? - What? - Do you see the chick over there? - So what? If you can seduce her, you’ll be Hoang’s uncle. Deal? Excuse me! Do you have wine? Sorry, we don’t. Give me the menu. Strawberry smoothies, then. Yes, sir. Thanks. - What? - I didn’t do anything! What? How could you guys come up with that idea? What if she doesn't agree? Just give it a try! - Let me ring her. - God! Hello? Is that you? - I'm so surprised! God! - Yes. It's me. It's been years since the last time I heard your voice. Miss you so bad. Van, please do me a favor. Where are you now? Gosh! What's that sound? I'm on the way to your place. Be there in 30 minutes. Thirty minutes? What should I wear now? What do you want me to wear? You look good in anything. Please come. Right here waiting for you. - Okay. Bye. - Bye. - I’m doing this just because of our son. - I know, I know. Gentlemen. How can I help you? Hi, I’m Cuong. I had an appointment with Mrs. Van. Yes, Mr. Cuong. You look so handsome and elegant in person. Thanks. Mrs. Van is waiting upstairs. Come on up. Thank you. Hello. You’re pretty as always. Take a seat, please. Thanks. Have you chosen anything for your lover? Come on, tell you... tell you what... I know all the spas in town. Why do I have no idea about this place? It’s just opened. That’s why. How are you? I thought about you right when I arrived in Vietnam. So... Is the bar going well? I’ve seen so many advertisements for it. Are you still with Han? I... I want to give you some vouchers. You look so handsome but your forehead’s a bit wrinkled. And you have bags under your eyes. If you receive our skin treatment, you’ll look a lot younger. Oh my God! How charming you are! Wow! No man could refuse you, huh? What a pity! I’m not a man. And I’m married. To our son. Thank you for helping me. Don't be silly. I’ll get mad if you keep saying so. Why? It’s my responsibility. You know, I’ve always felt guilty about you and our son. No, now you're being silly. It’s not your fault. Hoang gets it. Do you still remember the night… that night? Of course. - I’m very subtle. - Yes. My friend is having a friendly reunion. They’ve been close friends for years. I guess they have a lot of things to talk about. I’m very tactful. Yes. I can tell they’re really close to each other. When Mr. Cuong called Mrs. Van, she looked so cheerful. She became excited. She started to change her makeup style and put on a wonderful dress. She looked so happy, like a different person. Do you remember 20 years ago, this same song and a wine bottle kept us going... all night? I remember. I was so drunk and you were super excited all night. I wasn’t drunk, that's why I could tame you. Tell me the truth. I’m serious. Our income is over $4,300 a day. - Hey, quick question. - Yes. Do you have permit? I know a lot of spas being raided by the police. Strange question! You and Mrs. Van are close friends. Go ask her then. What's taking them so long? Yeah... She’s never talked to anyone this long. Is there something wrong? Hey! Ouch! Ouch! - What’s wrong? - Maybe I’m old. My bones are weak. - You’re avoiding me, aren’t you? - No, I’m not. I don’t believe that you’re old. You have firm pecs. You look cute with sweat all over your chest. - Hi there! - Honey! Hey... Honey... Are you okay? Why didn't he tell me? Man! He’s trying to hide it. How can he tell you? His maid is my nephew’s friend. He knew the secret and told me. Unbelievable! Actually, I do respect Mr. Thinh. Who can accept a principal whose daughter is pregnant out of wedlock? If the press know, they'll have a frenzy. The school board will be humiliated. What a situation! Honey, help me choose one. This one is contemporary, the other is more conservative. - Okay. - You don’t even look at them! Here, look at this one. - And this looks… - I said okay. - Whatever. - What do you mean? We're meeting the in-laws. We need to show them our manners and attitude. In-laws? I haven't agreed to their marriage yet. But we've reached an agreement, right? Marrying into this artist family could contribute to your promotion. PRINCIPAL XUAN Who's that? Hello? You're in Saigon, right? Yes. I need to talk to you when you get back to Hanoi. Yes, sir. I'll see you soon. What's that? How can Principal Xuan know we're in Saigon? What? Honey? Honey. Honey! Dom, is Auntie Han home? - You shouldn't have asked me. - Why not? She's your wife. Why do you ask me? My God! Dom, she's mad at me and I don’t know where she is now. Dad? What's wrong? Your mom agreed to come. - Thank you. I... - Great! Honey! Your dad's good at persuasion. How could your mom refuse him? Honey. Hey, honey! - Auntie! - Honey! What? Dom, what is this voodoo for? My love has died. I made this for the love between me and Hoang. Oh my god! You're crazy, Dom! Live happily, okay? Live happily for me as well. Honey. Let me explain. It's not what you think. No excuses, please. I'm alright. It's only a matter of time. How do we live without you? I’m satisfied with what I've done for my husband and son. If a bird is fully feathered, and a butterfly finds its own flower, let them fly freely. I can take care of myself. Honey! Where are you going? Looking for a place where I belong. Don’t hold my hand in public. Come on, don’t be mad at me anymore. If I’m wrong, forgive me, please. Besides, I didn't mean to do that back then. How irresponsible! She gave you an adorable son. How can you say so? Honey, you've been living with me for decades. Don’t you understand me? Everything I do is just for our son's happiness. You do the same, right? You and I each sacrifice a bit for his happiness, okay? Hoang wants to see you, but he's afraid. He asked me to do this. You know... I... I can’t live with women. I can only live with you. You're my wife and my son’s mother. - What is this? - The bar... one half is mine, and the other is yours. You own a half of my life. I haven’t lived with you all these years for these things. LIFE INSURANCE CONTRACT What is it now? Are you making a will? No, I think we aren't young anymore. If anything happens to me… All of my property is yours. I already talked to Hoang. He said Auntie Han deserved to inherit everything I have. Because she's been the one taking care of his dad his entire life. For the past 20 years, my love for you has remained unchanged. Honey, come back home. Wherever you are, that is my home. Honey, can I ask you something? What? Could I lean on your shoulders? But we're in public. Just for ten seconds. Come in. Dad, the... I... Excuse me. No, Hoang, hold on. I want to tell you something. - Honey! - Yes? - I'm going out. - Yes. Here’s the truth. I'm ashamed. I'm old, but I often get mad unreasonably at you and your dad. I feel embarrassed. I'm so sorry. No, Auntie... I've been thinking. To me, nothing's more important than your happiness. Your dad doesn't know this, but… - Auntie, I… - What? Do you feel guilty? I said I'm alright. I promise I won't ruin your night. Everything will be fine. Trust me. That settles it. VAN Yes, hello? Is that you, Hoang? I just want you to know I miss you so much. I'm happy to help you out and see you. Okay, I’ll come to you soon. Love you. Follow me! What is that? We're here. Please come in. Good evening. This is my Mom and Dad. This is Hoang. And this is his father. Nice to meet you. May I? Hello! Good evening. - Nice to meet you all. - Yes. Please. Please. Is your wife home? - Oh... - My mom will be back soon. - She’s at her mom's. - ...changing. She's at her mom's after changing. - She’s on the way home. - Oh, yes. - It’s okay. We can wait. - OK. I heard from Mai that you two are artists. - Yes. - I can tell right away. Your house looks like a Louis XIII Museum. Really unique! - Yes. - Look at that. It catches my eye first. At first, I didn’t know what it's about. No. I mean it’s quite abstract. Oh no. It’s hung upside down. This is more like it. Is that so? It’s just a girl? That doesn’t work. You should hang it upside down to make it look more mysterious. It’s art, so it should be ambiguous. Right? - Turn it upside down. - Very good! - We have the same taste. - Yes. Hey, move. I want to see that. What’s that? Oh my God. What’s this? A lamp. Look from afar, it’s just like a princess wearing a hat. Magnificent! Let me see... - Mom, just sit down! - What? It should be like this. The lamp. Great! It’s truly art. At first it looks like a princess, now it looks like a trumpet. That’s how art looks. Please, let's drink some tea. - Oh yes. - Yes. Excuse me. Drink it. First of all, this is our first meeting. I want to get to know each other, and later we'll talk about our children’s marriage. I’m a frank and simple person. So I’ll get straight to the point. Not to boast, but I’m a vice principal of a high school - and... - He’s going to be the principal soon. It’s one of the leading schools. All the students there are well-educated. Yes. They are also very well-behaved, righteous, and self-disciplined. However, there are some students who are open-minded. They love and marry early, without devotion to school and career. - What's that? - Dunno. 0This leads to severe consequences. Girls are naive, while boys are more mature. Who can we blame but boys? - Let’s sum up. Make it short. - Sorry! Briefly, that’s all the points I want to make. I also know that artists are quite open-minded. Get to the point! To sum it up, we were forced to be here because she... Here’s the thing... he’s a literature teacher so he's rather long-winded. I'll go straight to the point. - We're here today because Mai’s pregnant. - What? What? Oh... pregnancy. - That's right. - Pregnancy. Yes. So happy, right? So, we have to solve this problem as soon as possible before her belly gets bigger. What's that weird sound? It must be the housemaid screaming in the toilet. - He’s afraid of the dark. - I’m right here. - You're fast! - Finally, some light. Give me that. - Oh my God! - What? Nothing, Mom! That’s my gift to Hoang. Right? Yes, yes. You... - What a gift! - Okay, okay. She must have bought a prop for your movie, right? - Yes. - It's fine now. Let me. Excuse me! You... Excuse me. Hoang! - What’s going on in this family? - Mom! There's something very odd about these two. - And where’s the wife? - Exactly. Dad, they must be nervous. You are the only one speaking. Who wouldn’t feel overwhelmed listening to you? Hey, are you sure you know this guy well? Dad, they're just nervous. Even I'm stressed out now. - Are you nervous, Mom? - Yes. They must be nervous. I don't buy it. Hey, I need your help. I’m back! Hello everyone! Sorry I’m late. I don’t know why the traffic is so bad today. Oh my God! Is this my future daughter-in-law? Oh my God. - Yes? - Can I give you a hug? Yes, you can. - Wow, you smell nice! - Thanks. You’re also beautiful. Do you know that? Really gorgeous. How adorable! Why tea? You must serve wine. Come on, Hoang! I told you, but you forgot. Let me handle it. Sorry you two. Could you wait a little bit? Have a seat. - Mom, Dad, sit down please. - Please, sit down. According to Western culture, we should drink a glass of wine before a meal. It increases our appetite. You look a little different... from other women. Right! Your voice is... sweeter than I thought. Thank... Thank you! You also look younger than I imagined. You must have been a hot boy when you were young. You must have been a lady killer. Your wife must have fallen head over heels for you back then. No doubt why your daughter is so gorgeous. She definitely inherits her father's good genes. Your mother must be sad since you don't take after her at all. - Let's cheers! The wine is getting warm. - Yes. - Let’s cheers! - We share the drink? No. Cheers mean "best wishes to our health." Right! Cheers, cheers. Yes, cheers! May I ask you something? Is your front house rented as a club? It’s better to stay in a peaceful place at this age, right? What kind of men out there wear all those weird clothes? To be honest, as Southerners, my husband and I are very young at heart. - Oh, I see. - It's fine now. People in weird clothes out there are artists. They just wear what they like. We can do nothing about that. I agree with you that it's common sense that men should be men and women should be women. It’s ridiculous to be something in the middle, right? Mom, change the subject, please. Stop talking about this! I really want to hear from your mom. Let her speak. You see? Well, I think variety is essential to life. Gender is the same. This is all science and stuff. Oh yes. Science. There's something that happens with certain fish. In mating season, if a male fails to find a female suited for his need, he can turn himself into a female. Queer, right? You see, even animals can be transsexual, just as humans can. People can choose how to live as long as they feel happy. Yes. That’s how life becomes meaningful and colorful. The beauty of life. I love wearing clothes in all the colors of the rainbow. That’s my point of view. What about you? Honestly, I don’t know much about wildlife. But your talk makes me curious. I guess I should find out more. Let’s drink! - Yes! - Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers! - Oh my God, you haven’t finished? - I’m looking it up. It takes time. I can feel that you are fashionable and sophisticated, right? Frankly speaking, I own a shop selling authentic handbags. Hey, - I was surprised seeing your handbag. - Why? As if our families are destined to meet each other. I have the exact same one. - Oh my God. - As if they were twins. - Oh my God, it looks the same. - Yeah. We are meant to be. - That... - What? - What? - Why pearls? What? It should be two red sapphires right there. Do you remember? You bought me... Oh sorry... My bad. I was wrong. I got it. This one must be a limited version. Accessories are weird. For instance, in hundreds of products, there will be one that's made different from the others intentionally. That one costs extra. You must be so chic to have it. Your mother is so damned polite! Honestly, I sell fake handbags. This is from my shop. I also have authentic ones, but appearance is not important. What matters is what's inside the bag, right? Right! Oops! My bad! My mom can go on and on in the right company. No. No. It’s really fun. I like to hear your mom’s story. I rarely meet a woman as interesting and energetic as you. Oh... Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers! Food is served. - Oh, let’s eat! - Yeah. Instant noodles? Are you surprised? - Yes! - Are you surprised? Yeah. Don’t be surprised. It’s fresh noodles. It’s made of brown rice powder. It’s delicious and healthy. This is our family's traditional food. - Oh yes. - Enjoy your meal. Eat up! Bon appétit. No, no. I won’t eat. If I do I’ll throw up, then nobody can eat. Oh... Please enjoy your meal. So delicious. It's good. It tastes familiar. Honey! Oops. - Oh no! Oh my God. - Oops. God! I’ll kill you, Dom Dom! Dom Dom, if we run out of spices, you have to let me know. Why didn’t you tell me? This is an instant noodles flavor package. Such a good sense of humor. And it is not spices? Now, stop talking nonsense! Go make him another one. Don’t be mad at him. He’ll make a new dish. - No problem. - Yes. We're having so much fun today. Have mine instead. So many challenges today. Oh my God. So you two banged? - Honey, what does "bang" mean? - Uh... - You don’t understand? - No, I don’t. It means "nailed." Kids these days are more reckless than we were, right? - Yes. - Very bold. Do you remember? When we were young, we didn't dare show our love in public, right? Yes. Holding hands was already too much. Now they even suck face. Oh my God! Mom! Oh my God! What am I talking about? Shame on me! Mom! GO HOME. DON’T COME IN. I’LL CALL YOU. - Honey, stop crying! - Oh my God! Come on! What have I done? Honey! I’ve ruined our son’s night. It’s okay. - Luckily, they didn’t see it. - It’s okay! - Don’t worry! - Thanks, dear. - How nice you are! How pretty you are! - Stop crying. I’m so sorry. - I’m sorry. - It’s okay. Come on. - It's okay. - Come on. - Stop crying. - I’m such an idiot! I don’t know why I drank so much today. - Come on. - I was deadly drunk. Stop crying, honey. Where’s Hoang? I want to apologize to him. I was like an alcoholic. I don't know what I talking about. Do you find our daughter’s mother-in-law interesting? How about me? You were so happy when she talked to you. Don't forget you're an esteemed teacher. Hey you... I think there’s something strange about this family. See? Who’s that? Hey, lady! Hey! What else is going on? Are you the in-laws? Sorry I’m late. The traffic was heavy. I don’t know why the traffic is so bad today. I don’t get it. Who are you? I'm Hoang’s Mom. Sorry for being rude. But how many "biological moms" does Hoang have? There’s only one. Thanks for coming, Mom. My dear son! Let me introduce. This is my real Mom. I’m sorry that Mai and I have lied to you. I lied about my pregnancy. - What? - What? How come? I was afraid you wouldn't come with me. And I also want you to accept our marriage. So you two planned to deceive us? No, no. It’s not what you think. I know you’re very angry now. But I just want you to understand. So far we have talked and shared with you with honesty. Then what's going on? We are all honest. Please meet Han. She is also my mom. The club out there belongs to my dad. And my mom, she’s a drag queen. But why does he call you mom? Well. Just take a look at me, and her. Actually, we’re not really different. She’s his mom. So am I. We have no difference. I don’t get it. You don't? Here it is. The lady in the cream dress gave birth to Hoang, while the man in the green dress brought him up. This man fathered Hoang with the cream dress lady, but he’s married - to the man in the green dress. - Too confusing! You're making no sense. Dad! Mr. Cuong and Auntie Han are in love. So... this is my family. My Dad loves Auntie Han. Just like how I love Mai. - Honey. - I understand. Mai. - Let’s go home! - Wait. Honey. They love... Sorry. This hurts my eyes. Hey. Honey. Honey! Honey. Mai. Honey! Have I been doing well? - Honey! Wait for our daughter! - Let’s go home! - Dad! - What? - We can’t go now. - Why? Oh, that’s why... PRINCIPAL XUAN Gosh. My career has been ruined. If only there was one detective. How can we handle a group of them? What should we do? - Honey! - Yes? I have an idea. - What? - Everyone! I have an idea. Oh gosh! I’ll die of shame if anyone sees me in this weird getup. Dad, you’re still really charming. - Don’t worry. - Oh my God! Dad. Dad. Let’s go. This way, Mom. Scooch. Well, I think variety is essential to life. People can choose how to live. That’s how life becomes meaningful and colorful. This is my family. My Dad loves Auntie Han. Just like how I love Mai. ONE MONTH LATER It’s almost time. I'm nervous. Hey guys. - The ceremony’s about to begin. - Shall we? Cheer up, honey! I’m going to see Mai. Esteemed guests, honestly, I’m kind of jealous of their happiness. However, please welcome our gorgeous bride, Ngoc Mai. Firstly, l’d like to greet everyone from the bride’s and the groom’s sides. I intended to come up here to express my gratitude to you and let you enjoy the party. But now, I’d like to share with you one thing that I know I'll regret my whole life if I don’t say it. Yes, besides Van, I have another wife. She’s the one who took care of me and my son all these years. You requested to be absent in our son’s wedding. You’ve been hiding for 20 years. I want you to come out today. Honey! Come here with me! Please, go up there. It wouldn't be a family without you. No one can replace you. That bastard! I think... having a lovely son to his parents like Hoang, any woman, not only me, would love to be his mother, to love and to take care of him. I think I’m the lucky one. Because of him, I believe I am a mom. Being a mom is very wonderful, right? Really fun! I love that job.
