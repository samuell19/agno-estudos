And now it's time for Political Jeopardy!. From Washington DC we have Frank. Frank is the manager of a spy shop and a conspiracy buff. Next to him is Natalie from Seattle. She is an elementary school drama teacher and aspiring playwright. And from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania our returning champion Jerry. Jerry is a veterinarian and a producer of his very own cable access show. And now it's time to meet our host. Here's Sid. Hey! How you doing! All right ladies and gentlemen, we've got one hell of a show tonight. The object of the game is to collect as many Prozac tablets as you possibly can by giving the correct responses to the questions on the board. Please remember to phrase your responses in question form. Are you ready? Fantastic! Okay! Tonight's categories are: censored words, communicable diseases, crooked politicians, conspiracies, constitutional calamities, and corporate cons. Let's get started. Jerry as a returning champion you make the first selection. Can I have censored words for one tablet please. You sure can. A word placed on the tombstones of 16th century prostitutes. What is fuck. That is correct! All right, please make another selection. Communicable diseases for one tablet please. This device can give you over 90% protection from STDs and unwanted pregnancies. What is a vibrator. I’m sorry that's incorrect. Frank. What is it was a condom. That is correct. Please make another selection. I would like to take five tablets of conspiracy, Sid. Oh wow looky here, Frank, you lucky dog. You have found today's daily dosage. That enables you to take any or all of your Prozac tablets. Since you only have one, you can wager up to five. I want to take them all. Frank I like your style. For five tablets, they have implanted a recording device in your filling to monitor your every move. Who are the space aliens. You need to be more specific. Who is the federal government. That is correct, Frank. You have earned today’s daily dosage. Katie go on over there and medicate him. Oh this is fantastic. This has been such an exciting show. Congratulations Frank. Ladies and gentlemen, that's all the show we have for you tonight, but please tune in next time for celebrity political jeopardy where our guests will be Don Knotts, Malachi from children of the corn, and Molly Ringwald. Be there!. Okay you guys we are live in three. Three, two …. We're back. We'd like to get serious for a moment and remember our dear friend and political activist Abbey Archer who passed away this week. You are like clairvoyant and it's freaking me out…. Tell me why you're opposing the prayer in schools initiative. Well uh first of all you have to understand that there's a great many people who actually believe that the world was created in seven days because it says so in the bible. Now my aunt Sadie on the other hand, bless her soul, she was a devout Christian … she told me that Jesus had apparently come to her in a dream and Jesus clued her in that it was actually Satan the great deceiver who had written the bible in order to dupe people into leading a life of sin all the while thinking they were serving the lord. That's brilliant. Hey everyone's entitled to their opinion right which is one of the great things about this country. And the reason we're fighting the initiative is a big part of keeping our freedom of thought comes from separating church and state. Brilliant. Abbey Archer. And finally we take you out to the grassy knoll for our conspiracy of the week. An ultra right-wing paramilitary group is believed to be secretly assassinating political activists with a microwave assassination device. I’ll see you burn in hell for that. No Frank no they did not move the furniture. Yes they did. Komodo dragons. Nobody moved the furniture. Guys that was a great show. Abbey would’ve been proud. How awesome was political jeopardy. Oh man was that funny and with the Prozac … Katie that was a great idea. Hey Frank what's up with that conspiracy man. Oh yeah I think that was a little over the top. A little over the top? Did the Indians get blankets infected with smallpox? No, no it's just the beginning. It's a postage stamp in the bigger picture. The truth is that the US government was blackmailed into giving them the formula for the weapons version of the device because they were threatening to bring David Koresh out of hiding. He's alive. Really?. No shit. There's a fine line between conspiracy and insanity. I saw that. Can you explain the two Darrens on bewitched. Guys, Natalie and I are going to nudestock this weekend. Anybody want to go?. Me … I want to go. Going to be a nude dude. Frank?. Um when is it going to be?. Saturday … Saturday I have to work … I have to work. Katie?. Um oh look you guys Eat Me’s on. No seriously these kids are outrageous. Caller, you there. Do you have a topic for us. Yeah. Why isn't the smart ass little kid in school. It's night time. School's over dumb shit. So why don't you take your phone and stick it up your ass. Yeah eat me. Caller let's hear it. I want to know how old you two are. Listen Moses, you can take your age and stick it up your ass!. I love public access. Wildlife is important for healthy forests and wetlands which in turn provide us with clean air and water. Then why isn't the government doing more to protect the environment? Greed. The blind search for profit. And if we don't do something about it now one day soon we might be an endangered species. First the corporate machine will build over our forests, and then they'll pollute our food and water, then we will all experience a slow and agonizing death. Hello Mrs Dickman. Hello children. Ms. Wright I'd like to speak with you. Keep rehearsing guys. People tell me that this play you're putting on is heavy-handed. Who who?. That's not important. Also, parents are complaining about your television show. Who who?. That's confidential. Just remember Ms. Wright, we're watching you. Why are we subjecting ourselves to this?. It's only once a year. I mean even Hitler had a birthday. Actually Hitler did not have a birthday. He was genetically engineered. Who told you that?. Frank. Figures. Now you be good. Door's open. Welcome to the house of the lord. Mary, Mary, Mary, it is so nice to see you my darling. It's Natalie dad. You know that. I believe on my birthday, in my house, I should be allowed to call my daughter by her Christian name. Don't start with me dad. What's new Mr. Wright?. The lord's work is never done. There's always something new young man. Come to my study I'll tell you all about it. Dinner will be served soon. Gerald wipe your feet. My name is Jerry sir. How nice for you. Oh you shouldn't have gotten me … something so small. No that's very charming. Thank you. Yes, yes, yes. Well, wel,l well. Praise the lord. Gerald you know I was once a young man like you. That is hard to believe sir. Gerald let me get right to the point. You've been dating Mary for some two years now, I thought it was time that we talked about her future and whatever plans you might have together. Well we're very interested in the future and that's why we're working to make a difference. Running an animal shelter and making home videos with your pals doesn't exactly provide the kind of security and wealth that my daughter will require to raise a family. Daddy I'm not a child. I've been talking to my people and we thought this would be an appropriate time to offer you a position at my network. Can we change the subject dad?. Distilled water?. Please. Gerald?. Sure. So what have you two kids been up to lately?. The funniest thing happened. Last weekend we decided to do a piece for the show on this festival …. What?. It wasn't that funny. What are you hiding?. I'm not hiding anything. Then tell me what you did last weekend. All right fine. We went to nude stock, the all-nude festival, but it was so cold that everyone had to wear clothes. A school teacher cannot be seen at a nudie carnival. This is a horrible example for children. Does Mrs. Dickman know about this. To hell with Mrs. Dickman, Natalie can do what she wants on her own time. Profanity is the language of Satan and Satan does not dine in my house. Well that's good because I heard Satan has lousy tables. Oh you make light of Satan. Satan’s wine is the poison of dragons and the cruel venom of asps. You forced me to tell you the goddamn story. Oh Mary that language will not be tolerated. My name is not Mary. It’s Natalie for Christ’s sakes after mom - not after some mythological virgin. I lost my virginity at that bible camp you sent me to when I was 12. No! I won't listen to these lies. Leave now!. Come on Jer. It's been real,. God help you, you will both surely rue this day. Hello there. I'm Anita Deal and I am incredibly excited to bring you this revolutionary tool in perception. V-vision! Right now we're going to meet the inventor of V-vision, Dr Veil. Dr Veil if everybody already has a V chip to filter out filthy programming in their TVs why do they need these incredibly attractive designer glasses. Well Ms. Deal that's a very good question. After years of extensive research at the Baktali Institute of Technology of Research, we have ascertained that most Americans don't watch television 24 hours a day. Now we've created V-vision and the way it works is that it blocks out what's happening in everyday life … the ghettos, the crime, and the criminals. And what it does is instead of that you would see a beautiful, peaceful and surreal images that lull the viewer into a trance-like euphoric state. You are a beautiful woman. Oh! Now we're going to hear from some of our incredibly satisfied customers. Make love to me in the weirdest way. Last week on my way to the market a dozen bums asked me for change. This week with V-vision I can't see or hear any of them. My neighbor is a homicidal maniac who used to keep me up at night killing his victims. But not anymore because I have V-vision and it is helping me to block things out so I can get the rest that I need. It's like … this is bad … these are boss specs. Without V-vision you are faced with the poverty, violence, and pornography of the world around you. But put on a pair of V-vision designer glasses and everything becomes clean and pure. V-vision … using yesterday's ignorance to shape tomorrow's world. Oh sheeba shabba looba doo bah doo wah …. Katie, what's going on?. I didn't do that. I don't I don't know. Jerry, they're shutting us down. What's going on. You must leave immediately. You can't get away with this you son of a bitch. How can you do this to your own daughter?. You think you can silence us like this? You think you can stop us?. I am silencing you heathen. Thou shalt no longer infect the minds of children against everything this country stands for. We are everything this country stands for you jackass like freedom of speech, equality before the law, the right to be who you want to be. If you do this dad I won't ever talk to you again. You are no longer my daughter Natalie. I disown you. Disownership papers. You can leave now or face arrest, and please take this band of sinners with you. Move out. Everyone go limp. Bobby, there's got to be something we can do. I'm telling you guys it's vile, disgusting, horrible, and violates all norms of civilized society, but it is completely legal. Cable companies are permitted to direct public access stations to other uses if they are quote not well utilized. Capitalism run amok. This is no coincidence. This guy wrote the playbook for the new world order. What about getting a new public access station. Until the city finds another contractor we're screwed. When's that gonna be?. Who knows? It's a bureaucracy. They specialize in getting nothing done especially if there's no public outcry. Anger is the only thing they respond to. I remember standing at the barricades, facing down the man. We were united. It had an impact. We made a difference. That's it! We’ve got to get everybody from the station to band together and we're going to go down there and we're going to voice our anger as one. Oh Jerry this protest sucks! it's a joke! We got no grassroots organization, no financial backing, no direction, no nothing. Do you have any idea what the chlorine gas released from that tub does to the ozone layer?. Listen up granola head. This is a free country. Hey lady, why don't you stick a green thumb up your ass. There will be no freedom in this country as long as we have bimbos like you perpetuating female stereotypes that reek of sexual servitude to a patriarchal society. Go fuck yourself you feminazi. You get out of the water!. How long are you people on public access going to allow yourselves to be the uncle toms of the corporate media elite?. Right now! Right now! You want some of this?. Katie stop it. Hey everybody it’s the press! Shut up!. This party blows. I'm outta here. Stick this protest up your ass. Yeah eat me. Nice kick, Eddie. Jer, you okay?. I used to like that kid. Let’s go, Jer. We're just torturing ourselves. We’ll get our message out. The lord giveth and the lord taketh away. Blessed be the powers of the lord.]. You're right, Natalie. We haven't gotten our message out. We’re going to fight this thing. We're gonna be heard if we have to take it down the city hall. Well, well, well. If it isn’t the freak show! Well you'll be happy to hear that I'm filing the Reverend’s plans to upgrade Christian Unity Network Television's newest station. What a stupid bunch of losers. Why don’t you do something with your lives. I am sick of paying taxes so you lazy bums can sit around all day playing counter culture. Get a job! Have a family! Produce anything! Just get out of my way. Maybe they’ll beat some sense into you!. This is just one day out of our lives. Please just keep your voices down. They're watching us. We’re under surveillance. Jer, how the hell are we gonna get out of here?. Honey, Bobby will do something. What if they've gotten to Bobby? What if Bobby's been bought off? What if no one knows we're in here? What if we never get out of here?. This is the price that we pay for challenging the tyranny of illegitimate authority. Frank, we're gonna get out of here. How do you know that?. Cause we have to get out of here. Frank mellow out. You're paranoid and you're bumming everybody out. Jerry you think I'm paranoid. Frank you thought that Jerry Garcia was with the DEA. Yeah so?. Frank you thought they were aiming a ray gun into your bedroom window to make you weak when you just had the flu. I never get the flu. How do you explain that?. Stop. Hey I know you! You’re the TV guys. You’re on that cable show..whaddaya call it? You’re on right before those ‘stick it up your ass’ kids, right?. “Eat Me.”. Fuck you. That’s not it. Your show is... Anarchy TV. That's it! I love your show. That special report you did on the rubber gloves has definitely saved me a disease or two. Oh and you have that crazy guy with all the paranoid conspiracy theories. I’m not paranoid. It’s him! It’s him! I love you. You are the greatest. First time in huh?. Hey why don’t you take your hands off him. Hey what's your fuckin’ problem, Joe!. Guard!. Buzz off Tiffany! I don't need your mouth. Listen fat ass boy. I'm not scared of you. Now let the nut go. Stop, stop, stop, stop. The machine has us fighting against each other. They love it when we fight each other because when we fight each other we're not fighting them. Can't you see? They're watching us right now. They're laughing at us. We're caged down here like a bunch of animals. Look we don't even have a toilet. Do you guys have toilet paper? The ladies don't even have toilet paper. You know what that is? That is cruel and unusual punishment. Cruel and unusual punishment. You know what cruel and unusual punishment means? Our eighth amendment rights as American citizens are being violated. Your eighth amendment rights as an American citizen are being violated. But rights are not just established by words. No. They are won and they are sustained by struggle, and right now we have got to struggle together to get our freedom. We want our freedom now. We want our freedom now! We want our freedom now! We want our freedom now! We want our freedom now! We want our freedom now! We want our freedom now! . You guys are going to be here a long time. How do you know that? . Enough Frank. Do you have any idea how bad it smells in there?. I have the play at school. Bobby, you couldn't dig the money up anywhere?. I'll see what I can do, but Jerry all your friends are broke including me. And Natalie's father doesn't want to have anything to do with her. We're prepared to do whatever it takes, Bobby. Have you tried the vet?. Your bail’s been posted. What?. I posted your bail. You're free to go. Really?. Yes! You guys inspired me so much. Anyone who can make that animal Joe stand up for anything deserve my support. Besides I just want to be on your show. I think you guys are the greatest. As soon as we get our show back you got it. We get it back. Let's get out of here!. All right!. Here's to Tiffany. Be careful with that, please. What is this Frank?. Oh um this is a uh miniature uh Spy Con … let go I'll show you … Spy Con high fidelity bug and tap detector with this super multiplexing mil-spec cable descrambler. Can you get cable?. Sure, sure I can. I'll show you. Look out, Jerry. Channels galore. Wait, wait. Go back. We can not sit back my friends while Satan’s message devours …. Turn it up!. Change it!. Honey I want to see what Mussolini’s broadcasting from our station. And we must not glamorize, no, we must not celebrate the notion of pornography. I said pornography, and I whisper pornography like the dirty little shameful secret it is. Though some would shout sodomy, some would shout fornication, some shout pornography from the little devil's box that we must eradicate one channel at a time going click hallelujah, click praise the lord, until the devil's message is gone from our lives. Just when he was getting to the good part. I've had a lifetime of that crap, I can't take any more. What's going on?. That's her father. I'm sorry baby he's such an asshole. Yeah he is. You know in my day we wouldn't take this sitting down. Oh no, no, wait, wait. I just got out of jail. I can't hear this. No, no, no. We would organize. We would build momentum. We would be deaf to their lies and blind to their illusions. We would cut ourselves free from the strings that jerk us like puppets and we would create our own destiny. We would achieve justice by all means necessary. By all means necessary. Right on man!. I've got it. I got it. Time to see what the good word is tonight. You are watching God's station. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah! And now for the Countdown to Armageddon!. This is the kind of television people want to see. Count your blessings and say your prayers, because the times are changing, the signs are there. It's plain as day I'm sure you'll agree, that the world will soon be history. What are you doing? We all agreed no guns. Katie I’m so sorry. I fell. What were you thinking?. What if they shoot at us? These are very dangerous people. Then you get to die for the cause, Frank. It’s just a scratch, Katie. You guys still want to do this?. Let’s do this. Bingo. Hey listen I don't know you, and I don't have any gripe with you man, but I have been censored, abused and imprisoned all because of your boss and at this point I'm ready to blow this place sky high so I suggest you leave right now. Jedi mind trick you will let us pass. Buying that station was the best investment I ever made. Coming up next is the personal tale of revelation that will forever change the way that you look at your television set. For God's sakes stay tuned. Okay world you are watching Anarchy TV. We are reclaiming this station to assert our constitutional right to free speech. We start broadcasting now. Power of the people!. Harry what is this? Is this a joke? . No this is no joke. Everybody just stay calm. If you cooperate you will not be hurt. I want everyone to make their way out to the lobby right now. Come on preacher man. I'm not going anywhere. I refuse to be intimidated by every young person that straps some dynamite to their chest. Fine. Let's take them into the control room and tie him up. Everybody else make your way out to the lobby. Sweetheart you're in charge. Let's redecorate. Don't worry about it Reverend. We've got it covered. This must be kept quiet Chief Cochon. You keep the police away. You got it Reverend Wright. And if anybody from the press calls stonewall them. I don't want those little punks, those delinquents to get one bit of attention. Whatever you say Reverend. All right. I'm glad I can count on a good God-fearing man like yourself Chief. Of course Reverend. And I look forward to seeing you at the charity bake and bowl next week. Oh thank you goddess. You are watching Anarchy TV. We have seized control of this station to protest the sale of our public access channel to a private company. Without access to the means of communication our constitutional right to free speech is just an empty promise. We are going to hold on to this station until public access TV is rightfully restored to the people. We'll be right back. Sound volume's high and I'm losing the signal on the remote feeds here. I'm working on it Katie. The people that control organized religions don't want it known that the divine power and the ultimate wisdom is not in a church but inside each human being. They bought it. I told you they would. Suicide bomber costume’s our biggest seller. Is everything secure? Jerry nothing's ever really secure. That's good. You just put your paranoia to good use. I'm not paranoid. I knew it! Hi! I'm Reverend profit and I'm unbelievably happy to see you. I've successfully started over 25 religions and with my new home video so can you. By the time you finish my course you're going to think you're the big guy himself. Should we get that mother?. Harold, what would we do with our own religion?. I'm going to show you how you can both write and interpret scripture to suit your own needs, and if you order right now I'm going to throw in my own patented demonic adversary to explain away any flaws in your belief system. It's the best deal in the universe. Order now. What's the situation Greed?. Jerry you there?. What's up, Frank?. The Reverend has arrived. They have implemented the emergency defense system sir. That place is pretty much impregnable. They're also broadcasting live. Oh yeah and they're holding Mr. Arnold as a hostage. All I know is God's station is not on the air right now. Probably, but they can't hear us. We didn't get the mics operational yet. What about the safe?. 100% secure. That is the same safe the desert storm plans were held in at the NSA. The men are in position to shut off the power whenever you're ready sir. Emergency power? Doesn't matter. If the power goes off even for a second the computer goes down and they won't be able to transmit any signal. Jerry they're going to cut the power. You’ve got to meet me in the basement. Any second now sir. Frank where are you? Back here. Ready sir. Whenever you're ready, Reverend. Okay you have to turn on the emergency power at the exact same time that i turn off the main power. You got it? I got it. On three. Three two one . Frank! You okay. Oh man I'm sorry buddy. Talk to me Frank. I know who had the Kennedys killed . We'll get them another way, Reverend. How can you work for that guy Clarence? Do you know anything about him? There has been article after article written about how rotten he is. He thinks that women are second-class citizens. He thinks that homosexuals should be executed. And he's a racist. Doesn't that bother you? I mean you're an African American. What does the color of my skin have to do with anything? If the Reverend was a racist, he never would have hired me. Oh, Clarence you cannot be that naïve. Oh lord. Hi I'm Natalie. Here's your safe sex tip. It is important to remember that when using a dildo, one must treat it exactly like a penis and put a condom on it. Especially when it's used by multiple partners. Turn that execration off. Take out the dish, Greed. We can’t sir. You had it fortified in case the feds ever pulled a Waco on us. But their power will run out in less than 24 hours so all we have to do is wait. Don't tell me to wait. Ollie told me you were the best. I want them off my station now. Yes sir. All right love birds we are live in three. Three, two… Hi guys I figured I could be the most help here with you two. I'm sure you could be … We are live you guys. We already worked something out. That's okay I'm great at improvising. Watch this. Hi I'm Tiffany. I'm here with the cast of Anarchy TV. We all met in jail. It was my 18th bust for solicitation. Can you believe prostitution is illegal? I thought this was a capitalist country. If some horny bastard wants to pay me a hundred bucks so he can jerk off all over my face who the hell is government to interfere in my business? Right on! Absolutely right. Who are they to interfere in her business? That's very … thank you for the vivid introduction Tiffany. It's true we didn't meet in jail. We were arrested for protesting the elimination of our public access to television. Right now we are looking for your support. We want to know what you are thinking about the importance of free speech. Please give us a call at 555 oh one 69 and talk to us. Tell us what you think of free speech. Call us. We have a call. Great go ahead. Caller hello. Uh yeah I tried calling that number to order the instructional video you advertised, but I kept getting the suicide hotline. Oh, uh that was a parody. They're taking a call sir. They have callers. Turn it on. The commercial was not real. We were making fun of religious hucksters like Reverend Wright. People who prey on poor unsuspecting folks. Cut them off. My wife and I both want to say that we think Tiffany's doing a great job filling in for Clarence. Hello caller. Hello. The phones are dead. Frank where are you man. Frank, Frank, you there? The phone's dead man. Yeah Jerry. Give me a minute and I'll patch in my cell phone. Okay cool. Boy that Frank is good. He could steal the cherry from a 90 year old nun. Let's go to tape. I'm Sorely Reefer and sitting across from me is the Unabonger, a man who has been terrorizing DEA agents by sending them filthy bongs resulting in a mandatory five-year prison sentence for receiving drug paraphernalia in the mail. Unabonger, tell me, when all the smoke clears, what do you want to have happen. Well Regis, I want people to realize that the war on drugs is not a war on drugs, it's a war on people. That's what I want. But aren't you in the process violating and victimizing innocent people? Why yes I am Regis, but desperate times they call for desperate measures. Did you know that over 1,000 people a day are arrested on marijuana charges, 80 percent of those are for possession alone. There are people serving life sentences. There are over a hundred people on death row for pot. For pot. Pot. It's insane Regis. My name is Sorely. Mr. Unabonger, what would make you consider ending your campaign. I would I would have to … I don't remember. I don't remember. Would you like the best cookie you have ever had? No I would not like a cookie and I cannot accept anything from a known felon. I am a professional reporter. They are scrumptious. My wife is Amish. Oh yes. Oh yes. I am the cookie man people of earth. Hello I'm Candy Looney and I think that we should take the idiot who invented the child proof lighter, tie him to a stake, and then let him starve to death while we try to light him on fire with his goddamn contraption. I mean these child-proof lighters they make me so angry. I can light the American flag on fire. I mean this makes me so angry I’ll light my bra on fire. Jerry you look really pretty in a dress. Bobby, hi. Where is everybody? There's nobody here. Where are the cops? Where's the press? Nobody even wants to bust us? I don't understand it, Jer. I've called everybody. Maybe Frank was right. Maybe there is a big media conspiracy. Maybe nobody gives a damn. What are the ratings? What are the ratings man? Well if that was an EKG we'd be dead. Maybe you better call Dr Kevorkian. And let him know we got less than 20 hours of power left. I heard that. Look I’ll work on it and get back to you. Try to think of something to get some attention. Later man. Later. What'd Bobby say? He's got no idea. I do. Clearly this is coming down from central command Jerry. Frank please not now. Please. Okay. I'm sorry. The Reverend was really worried about that safe, Jerry. There's something in there. I know it. Can you get it open. Yes. It's going to take a few hours. It's very heavy duty stuff. Used by all the big boys. I mean it's incredible Jerry. They've got everything. They're ready for Armageddon in here. You're doing a great job, man, a great job. Thanks. Can you give me a little volume on this? Our operators are standing by we won't start the revolution without you. Come on guys we need your help. We need you to become involved. We have a new number. Frank's loaned us his cellular it is 917-555-0101. Did you hear that, Tiff. Yes. want to call us, call us and tell us why you don't want to call us. We have a call. Ah. Hello caller are you there? Who’s this? This is Anarchy TV who's this? This is your mother Frank stop it with the impersonations already. I'm not the FBI. Come on Frankie I need your help. I'm hearing those voices in my head again. I need you to come over and sleep with me tonight. Boy he’s kinky too. She's doing it to me again. Just like the fifth grade. Mrs Corder, I'm not Frank. I'm Frank's friend. He loaned us his phone for the show. We're live on the air. Well then put Frank on. Things are really kind of crazy right now. Missy, I am not crazy. I want to speak to my Frankie. Mrs. Corder you wait right there. Frank's gonna call you okay. At least their ratings are no better than ours, Reverend. Let's just hope they keep this guy's mother on the line all night. What about tomorrow, Greed? What about tomorrow? Well now it's nine minutes after the hour, and I'm wondering where you are America. What happened to the spirit of revolution? You know give me liberty or give me death. Having the right to speak your mind freely that's the very foundation of democracy. I need you to call me. I need to know that you care. You guys we have a call. We have a call. Is it Frank's mom again? Go ahead, caller. Jerry it's me Bobby. Bobby. Katie can we go to tape. Go ahead Bobby. No complaint has been filed with the police. As far as the press goes the Reverend has apparently told him that you're an experimental program to promote the Christian Unity Network's new youth missionary movement. You're kidding right. No fucking way. He's putting us in the missionary position. Welcome to cross burning. Today we debate the allocation of penal resources. More people are behind bars in America than in any other country in the world. Is it a new growth industry or just another huge welfare program? Joining us today are on the left Duke David, and on the right Lenny Speer. Duke you're first. Thank you, ma’am. Let me tell you a little story. Prisons are like another big brother. An expensive government handout to the scum of America. Now when I think of America, I think of the cream of the crop the cream that rises to the top and that cream is white. Let me tell you something else. It's time those people started paying their way. We could have an army of worker slaves that make them goddamn Chinese green with envy. I'm talking about making them make everything. Think of the profits. Pie in the sky-high profits. Duke, Duke, Duke. You’re such a bleeding heart liberal. Haven't we learned our lesson. Concentration camps never work. To engineer the perfect society, the solution is always extermination. Let's go to commercial. Fucking machine ripped me off again. Sid, change please. Anybody have any change. Sorry Katie. I'm starving. I could use some food. Yeah I'm starving too. Open it Frank. You could steal a turd outta my ass and I wouldn't even know it. Property is theft. Christ we're off the air. Who's on tape control? Shit, that's me. Sorry. What's the point? Nobody's watching. Why don't you lighten up Katie. You know I'm not gonna listen to you and nobody else is. Stop it. Stop it. We’ve dealt with bad ratings before. Come on guys. Why did we take over the station? It’s something that we all agreed on. You know we wanted to question authority, we wanted to challenge injustice, we wanted to take a stand, we wanted to expose the naked truth. Yeah! If we all went to naked we'd get some serious ratings. Uh Tiffany, hi. Thank you. It's about liberation not exploitation. Katie, nudity doesn't necessarily involve exploitation. There's nothing shameful about the naked body. Yeah, it's a first amendment issue. It's like our safe sex tips. All rights guys. Let's do it. You can't be serious. We can't go naked. Nobody gets to see me naked. I've never seen me naked. No naked. I bet you look great, Frank. How could you advocate selling out to the methods of mainstream media manipulation? Whoa nude anarchists. Stop the presses. I wonder what they have to say? Who cares? They're naked. Right. Katie, we have no time. Nobody's watching. It's not what we planned, but it is a revolutionary statement. What would you do to get people to watch? Yeah Tiffany's right. We have got to do something to just get people's attention. Fuck it. She's got balls. Jerry do something. It's totally voluntary. Sid fire up the cameras. We’re going live. Oh my God. Are they gone? Yeah they're gone. Oh my God. Sir, sir, sir. Sir, I think you need to see this. As you can see we’ve decided to give you the naked truth. Uncensored. I think it was Mark Twain who said “Nature knows no indecency. Man invents them.” Let this be just another nightmare. Mother, these people are naked. No they're not. Their headlights are on high beam. Women in those cultures are forced to wear veils. In America nudity is considered obscene which is just as selective of behavior. The Reverend sure has taken this station in a new direction. Hey, get out of the way. We were all born naked into the world, and it's only a warped, puritan ideology that tells people that their natural form is in some way obscene. Shame is just another tool that is used to control who you think. Hey guys Tiffany's on television. Holy shit, they’re naked! Ultimately it's about freedom and it's about liberty. Yes it is Jer. Great. Right. We are really tense our energy is low we need to exercise, and I just happen to be a certified aerobics instructor. What is she doing? I don't know. Come on guys I'm telling you. You will feel great. Sid crank up the music! All right Tiffany. No. Go back. Go back. Come on guys. Come on get over here. What is she doing? It's called aerobics and yeah do it to get fit. I need to get that switched. Come on guys! Come on, let’s go out there. Seriously, let’s do it. Are you high? Please feel free to join us home. You will feel great. Go ahead. Just take all your clothes off and start moving. You will feel great. Finally entertainment for the entire family. Would you look how quickly the revolution is co-opted. Now we're being led by a naked aerobics instructor. Katie, if a revolution falls in the forest and no one hears it, is it still a revolution? Yes it is Sid. It is a pure revolution. It is a revolution with meaning and values. Not this. Let's give it some meaning. Let's use a blue screen and we'll key in some political images and whatever we have. Let's just find something crazy. I cannot believe I’m doing this. You see how much better that is. Clarence, you like that don't you? What are you doing mother? Oh… Look out! You’ll poke your eye out. It’s wonderful. Wonderful. Freedom. Freedom. You sure can cut a rug mother. Yes Milton I had one of my famous chats with her. That's right. Sometimes teachers just need to be made aware of the influence that they have on children. That's right. Okay well don't worry about it we won't be having any more problems with her. All right now. Bye-bye. Christ! The last flight of the nut bird. Hey. Officer Sweitzer, how can I help you? Uh-huh. Naked people on your TV. Why didn't you just turn the channel? Uh-huh. All right. Yeah. We're on it. What? Some wacko says his daughter got possessed by satanic messages from naked people on TV. What channel? Channel 169. This footage reminds me of how fragile our freedoms really are in this society. I mean if this can happen to you at any time or at any place how can you say that you're truly free. What the fuck is this? This is Anarchy TV. Are you guys dancing out there? Hi I'm Susannah smart and I'm coming to you live from outside the studios of channel 96 where a naked religious cult has seized control of the station in protest of poor cable service. Jerry it's show time. Look at that. This is great. Okay. You should never underestimate the power of nudity, Katie. Excuse me officer, I'd like to drive through. I'm the attorney for the group that's taken over the station. Out of the car slowjam. Do it! What are you talking about? I’m the lawyer for the guys inside the station. Out of the car midnight. Don't make me use this. Do it! You're interfering with the most important act of civil disobedience since the levitating of the pentagon. Lord, why hast thou forsaken me. Reverend is it true that a revolutionary group called Anarchy TV has taken control of your station and taken hostages? Yes unfortunately that is true. These heathens have stolen my station in order to spread their doctrine of pornographic filth. Let's see what the coverage is like. …broadcasting an experimental program to promote the Christian Unity Network's new youth missionary movement. What about that Reverend? No, that's ridiculous. Well maybe this tape will jog your memory. Reverend, Is it true that your daughter is one of the people in there? I don't have a daughter. This just in. We have obtained exclusive footage of the naked protesters who have taken over channel 69. Why isn't she naked? Be advised, some of this footage might not be suitable for children and sensitive viewers. And now for the real news. The government is stealing from you the corporations are poisoning you and the media are lying to you. And now for the weather. What is going on Cochon? There was nothing I could do Reverend. Well do something now. Look at those animals parading naked on God's station. We think it's a serious commentary on the state of the media when you realize that we took over this station last night and nobody noticed until we took our clothes off and now the whole world is tuning in. We have a call from someone who claims to be the police chief Jerry. The police chief. Cool. Okay. I'm sure he's his own man speaks his own mind. Put him through. Hello. Who am I speaking with? Who am I speaking with? This is police Chief Cochon, and I'm calling to ascertain exactly what your demands are. Well chief my name is Jerry, this is Natalie, this is Tiffany. You're live on Anarchy TV, and our demands are that a public access station be made available to all the people, and we want that in writing. We want some pizza. And we want to talk to our lawyer. This type of fascist behavior will not intimidate me. Nor will it weaken my resolve to confront. And expose the abuse of power. Things aren't going your way. I mean sometimes the world can appear to be a really cruel and unfair place. Stop pandering to those little punks. They're terrorists. Can't you see that? They're like plagues of locusts. Listen to me you godless heathens. You cannot steal God's station. You will not spew forth venomous, vile, lewd, licentious smut and get away with it. Jerry we're gonna take the TV news signal and go split screen with you and the Reverend. Cool. Do it. I'll get the camera. Listen world. This guy is a greedy hate monger who uses a religious veil to hide a multi-million dollar business and propaganda machine designed to enrich him at our expense. He disseminates messages of hate. He shows a rampant disregard for the poor in the downtrodden, and he was an abusive father to the woman that I love, Natalie. You represent a failed counter culture society, an ideology that has been responsible for sexual disease, drug addiction, the decay of the American family, the callous disregard for the aged, for the unborn, and ultimately it is you who will be responsible for the moral decay of this great nation, the promotion and the glorification of Satan. There is no failed counter-culture ideology. What there is is a group of greedy and selfish individuals who have no regard for their fellow human beings or the planet that we all live on. People like you who promote a view of the world in which we are all pitted against each other in some kind of pathetic race for profit and power. You know you're the one who's immoral you are the one who glorifies evil. With people like you taking over the airwaves we might as well all just destroy our TV sets. What's the point of having one? You profit by painting a picture of the world in which danger lurks behind every corner and we are all powerless to make the world a better place. Poppa, what is he saying? He has a good point, Mother. The fact is that you think that freedom and democracy are threats to be avoided and not values to be preserved. That's the saddest part. Jerry! What? It's all true. It's all true. Everything. Exactly like I said. Frank I'm live. Please. No Jerry! The microwave assassination device. Exactly like I said. The victims, the operatives for the Christian Supremacy Movement. This is not the time for a conspiracy theory, Frank. This is not a theory. I got it out of the safe. The Reverend's safe. Look Abbey’s name is on the top of the list. You can't be serious. Jerry? What? You’ve got to let me take this out there. This is big. This is the summit of the mountain I've been climbing my whole life. You gotta. Okay. Go ahead. Frank is going to give evidence that implicates Reverend right with this unbelievable weapon. Jeez. It's lies. It's all lies. This has gone too far shut him down now. Relax Reverend they're gonna run out of power soon enough. Don’t talk back to me. What do you think I pay you for? We can't go in there. The place is barricaded, and they have a hostage. Oh I don't give a soggy shit about that little fuckhead, faggot, jungle bunny. Oh my God. See, I told you that guy was an evil son of a bitch. Katie, now is not the time. Clarence, we’re going to untie you. Hey Reverend take a pass! Stick this station up your ass! Hey Reverend take a pass! Stick this station up your ass! Hey Reverend take a pass! Stick this station up your ass! Hey Reverend take a pass! Stick this station up your ass! …because of their political beliefs. Because they disagree with you. People who are trying to make the world a better place. Here's your happy juice, sir. No. I don't want my medicine now. I want justice. I want a pox on their homes. Don't worry Reverend, you're gonna feel better in a minute. I hope so. Stop him. Somebody stop him! By violating my rights, you're participating in your own oppression. Every time you silence another voice, your own freedom of expression is diminished. Shut up! I don't need a lecture from you Mr. Moon Cricket. Society pays me to rid the scum like you off this planet. Okay. All right. Hey that guy's throwing money. They’re throwing money. Good morning world! Atta boy, Frank. Way to go! We kicked their ass! We got proof! I’ll shoot your ass! He’s got a gun! Heathen! I missed his dick. What happened? You got shot. You got shot. You're going to be all right. Just hang in there. Just hang in there. You're going to be alright. Don't touch it. Don't touch it. What the hell. He got me. Call an ambulance! Where's the ambulance! This proves it. This proves everything. Rotten machine. C’mon. Give me a hand. Put your shoulder to it. Hey where's the paramedic! Where’s the medic? No! No medic! Why not? No medic. Don't you leave me alone with them. Why not? That's when they implant the chip. Jerry this is not a real ambulance and those are not real medics.
