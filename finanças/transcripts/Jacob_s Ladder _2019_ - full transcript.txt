It's too quiet. There are six patrols out. Not a peek. I don't get it. - I don't like it. - Yeah. It doesn't make any sense. I gotta go make a phone call. Hey, gorgeous. What's goin' on? You ready? What's goin' on, Sam? Ready to be a daddy. Are you serious? - Six weeks. - Yes? Six weeks. - We're having a baby! - Ha-ha-ha. I take it you're happy. Baby, happy doesn't even come close to how I feel right now. I miss you so much. - I miss you. Jacob... - I'm gonna... Sam. - Can you hear me? Baby? - Sam... Sa... Baby, you're breaking up.

Is there a reading on the oxygen? Dr. Singer? Everything okay? Thought we lost you there for a minute. Just, uh, keeping you on your toes. Somebody has been sitting in my chair. Somebody has been lying in my bed. You see the way he just craves knowledge, like, he, he's-he's so well read and he's just, he... Obviously, he got that from me, you know? Yeah, let's hope he gets my sense of humor. Yeah, well... Yeah. Oh, look at that. - Look at that. - Look at that. You laughing. Look at this, eatin' the book and... W-we miss daddy. Do we miss daddy? Aw... Mmm. You okay? Just... work stuff, but... much better now. Right? Ab-ab-ab. I'm gonna put him down. Okay. Shh-shh-shh-shh. Babe. They are lucky to have you. And so are we. Hey. Honey. Hey. You okay? Well, I think you're having some rough dreams. I'm okay. Okay, well, hurry up. He-he-he. I got that client meeting this morning. Thank you. Yeah. Okey-do... Okay, okay. Okey-dokey. Okey-dokey. Uh, I'm-I'm not doing so great. I'm-I'm still... You know... Murph, look at me. Hey. You're okay. Like, come see me later and we'll try and figure something out. Okay, man. Alright, buddy. You. Mmm. Ah, sorry, man. Wa... Shit. We're overextended here. You know how it is. You go to war with the army you have, right? Yeah, except in this case, the war is everywhere and we're almost out of ammo. We're holding this place together with duct tape. Bingo! Alright. You good? I'm sleepin' like a baby. Then I am too. Oh, listen, if you, uh... You find any more "Wounded Warriors," you know, psychologically speaking you know, people that need help, then I might have some more ammo for the fight. As a trauma surgeon I have no official opinion, but I will pass that message along. Well, as your pharmacist, I have no clue what you're talking about. But thank you. Take care of yourself. You keep up the good work. - Nurse! - Get a doctor in here now! Relax, hold on, hold on. I-I-I need some help! Come on, come on. Alright, relax, relax. Give me two milligrams of Ativan right now. Go. I need you to back up. Clear this area. Now! Take it off. Easy, easy. Good, good. Let's get a gurney. Let's get ready. Go. - I got it. - Let's get him up. Good? Let's go. Okay, hold it. Jacob... Jacob Singer. - Do I know you? - Paul Rutiger. I was an operator in your brother's team. We did all three tours together. No shit. Well, nice to meet you. Yeah. Is... Is there something you wanna talk to me about? About my brother? He's here in Atlanta. - Excuse me? - Isaac is... P-people listening. I have to be careful. Look, whatever it is... Hey! Hey! Who was this guy? I don't know, he just seemed kinda lost. He's probably out of his mind. Isaac's been dead for over a year. You think this guy was on anything? I think all these guys are taking something. How else do you escape these fucking nightmares? Alright. Well, let me know if you see him again. I'd be interested to talk to him. How about you? - How are you doing? - Good. Good. No episodes? No. Not for years. He's just, he... Listen, he's got me thinking about Isaac and... We know you've had issues with your brother... Not issues. Hey... It's Just that our relationship was... complicated. What would you say to Isaac if he were here... right now? I would tell him that I'm... that I'm sorry. Hey, hey, hey, Jake. Jake. We were just talking about you. You, you-you wanna come out with us? - Yeah. Come out with us. - Yeah. Uh, some other time. Yeah. Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold up, hold on. I, I feel like we never get to hang out anymore, man. You alright? You seem like you're somewhere else. Yeah. No, I'm good. I'm good. I just, I just came from... seeing the shrink. Himmelman. You still seeing that guy? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. Don't let him mess with your head too much. These psych guys, they-they can cause more harm than good. Sometimes, I don't know. My layman's opinion. Well... I'll keep my eye on him. Good, man. - Alright? - Alright. Isaac? Isaac? Isaac. What do you want? Better keep your mouth shut. Mr. Singer? - Mr. Singer? - What are you doing here? No, no, no, I-I gotta get home. - I gotta get home. Uh... - They're after you. You need to be careful. Just go to the VA, ask for Dr. Louis Himmelman. Alright, he's helps out a lot of veterans. Better keep your mouth shut. What'd you say? Ain't that what he said? "Better keep your mouth shut." How do you know about that? - Your brother's in trouble. - No. He's here. Right now. I can show you. After that third tour, I was fuckin' broken, man. The shit we did over there, the shit we saw. Played in my head like some movie. All I could see was... bodies. Hey, hey. Okay, take it easy. I hooked up with some other vets... that's when I found the ladder. And that was it, man. That was the only thing that helped. There's abandoned tunnels runnin' underneath the entire system. We had our own world down there... for a while. Not anymore. - What happened? - Guys are getting killed. Did you call the cops? You... No, no, no. No way. No. No cops. They-they're in on it. You gotta get Ike out of there, he's right in the middle of it. - My brother is dead, Paul. - No, he's not. He's not. He's down there in those tunnels and it's not safe. The government has been giving a very dangerous drug... to the vets. It's called H-D-A. It was supposed to help with post-traumatic stress disorder but all it does is makes them crazy. Paul, just calm down. Calm down. Jacob, you gotta believe me. Your brother needs your help... It's your ID. Did you hear what I said? A man was thrown in front of a train. Someone threw a garbage bag onto the tracks. The conductor nearly had a stroke. - But no sign of anything else. - It's impossible. It's just not possible. I know what I saw. You're a surgeon, is that right? Yes, I'm a trauma surgeon. - I work at the VA. - Okay. So, you'd agree with me that if there were a collision between a human body and a moving train, there might be some physical evidence, right? You think I'm making this up? Is that what you think? Ask someone, ask around, someone must have seen them. Alright. Alright. We'll make some calls. While we do... you should just wait here. Just forget it. And thanks for your time. I know you got something on you, brother. - What? - You holding? No, no, I'm not holding. Don't be like that, brother. Please. Ahh! Isaac? Isaac? Isaac. Hey. Okay. Hey, can you hear me? It's Jacob. Jake? It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's just me. I wanna go home, Jake. I wanna go home. Okay. Okay, let's get you home. Come on. Come on. I, I got you. Come on. Yeah, that's, that's good. That's good. Alright. They're gonna kill me. They're gonna kill me. Come on. Let's go. Let's get you out of here. They're gonna kill me. Go. Go. Isaac? Oh, my... Oh, my God. Oh. I'll get you some more eggs. What? I just can't believe you're here. We thought you were dead. Maybe I was. I'm gonna go check on the little guy, and let you two talk. Gabriel, what's wrong, baby? So, uh, who were those guys? What? The guys in the tunnel. Who were they? I don't know, Jake. You don't know? You don't know Paul? He said he was in your unit. Yeah, Paul is the one that lead me to you and then I saw him murdered. Someone pushed him in front of a fucking train. I just wanna know what's going on? I don't know, I-I don't know. What are you taking? Just tell me. You really got the perfect life here, don't you, big bro? I'm just a fucking stain on it. - I know. - Don't do that. I worked really fucking hard when I got over there. And I was good. You don't know, I was good. I-I had my own men, I had my own team. For the first time in my life, I was where I was supposed to be, doing something. Yeah, it felt good. Yeah. I feel good and then, um... What? Isaac. Isaac, you're bleeding. Isaac! - I, I got you. I got you. - What's happening? Jacob! - What? - Grab his legs. - Okay. - He's burning up. - Oh! - Look at me. - Grab a thermometer. - Okay. Come on. Come on, Isaac. Hold on. Oh, my God. We gotta get him in the water. We gotta get some ice. Go get ice. Get me as much ice as possible. Go. Okay, I got you. I got you. I got you. Pour that ice on him. Isaac, Isaac, it's me. It's me. It's me. It's me. I need you to hold your breath. I need you to hold your breath. Come on. You trying to kill me? Don't do it. - Look at me. Look at me. - Don't kill me. Look at me. One more time. Hold your breath. Come on. More ice. More ice. I'm sorry, man. I had a dream about granddad's farm. I love that place. I saw that old fishin' hole barely any fish in it. He taught us in. You remember all that stuff? All I remember is we didn't catch a fuckin' thing. - Yeah. - You know? Dad was pouring beer on all the, all the worms. - "One for them, one for me." - Yeah. Right. Right. Yeah, I think about that place a lot. Me too. You're gonna die. Do you think I'm going to hell? What? No, of course not. I think maybe hell are these memories that I can't get rid of. The faces, all the faces I can't stop seeing. No. Hey. Look, you're home. Okay? You're home. Look at me. - You're safe. - Yeah. Alright? Okay. Okay. When you wake up, you'll feel better. How is he? It's worse than before. He seems different. Like it's not even Isaac. He's gonna be okay. I-I don't know what he got himself mixed up in but I-I'm gonna take care of it. You don't have to worry. Doctor? Doctor. I've been trying to reach you. Yeah, I've been in sessions all morning. I, um, I need to talk to you. No, Jacob. You need to schedule an appointment. I know, look, I'm sorry. It's just that I was already at the hospital, okay? - And I've just been... - Jacob... Um, can we catch up with you in next session? I gotta get downtown for a meeting. I'm-I'm running late, so... Isaac is alive. I know it sounds crazy. I do, but he is. Your brother, Isaac Singer, is alive? Yes. He is alive. - Are you certain it's him? - Yeah. How can that be? I thought he was air lifted to Germany. And you told me that he died en route. He's at my house right now with Sam. It's incredible, Jacob. I, um... never saw his body. We just saw coffins, so they must've just... Some dumb fucking clerical mistake, I don't know. But I promise you he is here. It's him. He's not in a good way though. He's seeing things and he's hearing things. What sort of things? I-I, I don't know. Faces. Demons. We all see things. But he needs professional help. He should come in. He thinks he's going to hell. Jacob, the only thing that burns in hell is the part of yourself that refuses to let go. Remember Meister Eckhart? He said, "If you are frightened to die "and you're holding on "then you will see battles tearing your life apart "but once you made your peace, then the devils... are angels freeing you from this earth." It's all on how you look at it. - Can I help you? - Yes, please. Yeah, let's get you a nurse. - Hey! - I need it. Take it easy. Just come with me. Alright, come with me. Okay, let's go in here. Okay? Okay. Just, you know what? Just have a seat right here. There you go. Just relax, I'm gonna go get a nurse. Alright? What? Hey, buddy. Hey. Hey! Hey, did you see a homeless vet run out of here? No. He just, he just attacked me. You okay? Yeah, what's going on with these guys? Had one last week that almost chewed off his own finger. Hoffman! - Hoffman! - Yeah. It's Jacob. Open up. Hey, man. Come in. You alright? You okay? Sorry, I couldn't hear you. You want a beer? I-I'm sorry to bust in on you like this. I just... I kind of have a situation at home. You want-you wanna take a seat? Okay, I'll, uh... What? I wanna know what this is? How do you mean? Hoffman, what I'm asking you, is what this is? What's it called? I think it's HDA. Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor. It targets traumatic memories. The vets, they call it "The Ladder." The VA had been prescribing it for sometime for PTSD but it got shelved. Bad side effects or some shit. Th-the fucking FDA are bunch of pussies. I-I think people maybe getting killed because of this. Come on. Hoffman, I saw it. Did you report this? I-I, I told the cops. Look, um... My brother's using this shit, so I-I... I gotta find out where it's coming from. Your brother? Yeah. I don't know. I'll ask around, I'll see what I can find out. I can't make any promises, but... There's some people I know that... I'll see what I can do. Okay. Okay. - Thanks. - Let me take this. Of course. Uh, Jake. Be careful. You gotta watch out who you talk to. Hey, baby. - What are you doing? - Where have you been? - Get off of me. - Where you've been? Get off me. Come back. Where are you going? Come back. Couldn't keep your mouth shut? Hey! What the fuck are you doing? You alright, man? You want me to call the cops? No. No. No cops. - No cops. - Alright. I'm okay. Thanks. I'm okay. Okay. Here we go. - You're bleeding. - It's nothing. Can you get me some ice, please? You tell me right now what fuck is going on? What are you... What are you talking about, Jake? I found that HDA in your coat. You're going through my stuff? You bringing that shit into my house where Gabe sleeps? Really? What? I... What are you talking about? Forget it. Forget it. Thank you. I need you to grab some clothes and an, and an overnight bag. - Jake, what is going on? - Sam, please. I just need you and Gabe to be somewhere safe. - Alright? - Yeah, let's, um, let's do it. Let's do what Jake says. I, um, I know you're upset. Sam, I need you to listen to me, please. What the hell is going on with you lately? There are these people that are after me. - What? - They broke into the house, Sam. - What house? This house? - Yes. I know I, I should've-I should've told you. Let me get this straight. Someone broke into my house and I'm just finding out about it now? - Yeah. - There's a family here. We have a family... I know, and I'm trying, I'm trying to protect this family. I know, Sam, but this is serious. Trust me. I think it has to do with drugs and these two fucked up guys that are following my brother. You're scaring me. Stop. Stop it. Whatever you're talking about, drugs and whoever's involved, I can't do this. So, yeah, I'll go to the hotel with Gabe. But this is the last time I'm leaving my house. Ever. Figure it out. Come here. Yeah, baby. Here we go. It's gonna be okay. I'll call you later. Isaac. Isaac! Isaac! No. No! No! No! No! Oh, no, no, no! Jake! - What is wrong with you? - Jake. Oh, you fuckin' don't know what you're doing? What? What don't I know? What? Now you wanna know about me? Yeah. Now you care about me, huh? No, you don't. - Just tell me. - Not a damn thing. Just tell me. Hey. Hey. - Oh! - Tell me what happened? We shouldn't have gone in there. We're operating at altitude, together exhausted... It should've been routine. Simple snatch and grab of an enemy combatant. The minute we got in that village it felt wrong and I... I let 'em into it. Down. Now! Go! It's a fucking ambush! I can still see them though. Everyday. Smell them, I fucking hear them, I can't sleep. All those bodies are in my head. They're right here. This shit, this drug... is the only thing that's ever helped me, Jacob. No. Look at yourself. Look at what this shit is doing to you, Isaac. Who's giving it to you? Hmm? Oh, she's here. Jacob. Hey. I had the strangest dream. Jacob... Jacob. Jacob... Jacob. Jacob. Jacob. It's okay. You're okay. You hit your head pretty hard. Where is Sam? She's here. Relax. Isaac's here, too. Jacob, easy. Where did you go? We were scared. I don't know. I don't know. I don't remember. Where were you? What do you mean? Jake, you disappeared on me. Take some time. We can get everything sorted out later, okay? Hey, ah, I need to see you. This is some dark shit. I-I don't wanna do this over the phone. Can you meet me? I was right, wasn't I? You'll see when you get here. Where are we? - Does it do other things? - What? The HDA. What do you mean, man? Does it make you see things that aren't there? What are you talking about, Jake? Why would you ask me that? Wh-what exactly is this guy suppose to be telling us anyway? He knows. He knows who's making this shit. They're the ones that are coming after us. Ah! Get in the car! Get in the car! - Ah! - Get down! Get down! What the fuck, Jake? Truck, truck, truck! - They set me up. - They're gone. Jake. Okay, they're gone. What? Hey... Hoffman sent them. I never heard you mention him before. - Who is Hoffman? - He must be the one. He must be the one that's making it. The HDA. He's... Listen... I wanted to tell you sooner. But I didn't want to scare you. These guys, these guys, they-they... threatened me. Hoffman must have sent them again... to kill me. Okay, maybe we need to call the police. No. No, no, no. We can't. We can't. Jacob, someone is threatening you. - No cops. No cops. - Okay, Jake. No cops. - Okay. - Okay. Okay. They're all fucking in on it. You don't get it. They're coming after us. What is that... What is that noise? - What is that noise? - What noise, Jake? That fucking clicking noise. Ah! Jake, it's okay. Jake. Fuck! What is going on? Oh! Look, don't, okay? What are fuck are you doing? - Hey, hey, hey. Look. - Jacob. - Jacob. - We're okay. - Jacob, stop! - Oh, oh, okay, man. - Don't fucking touch her! - Hey! Jacob, stop! Jacob! You think you can just show up and fuck up my life? Hm? What's happening? Huh? - Ah! - Stop it! You're scaring the baby. Go! Just go! Go. Excuse me. You know the guy who works in this lab? Excuse me. I'm looking for the guy who works in this lab. Jake. Everyone's looking for you. You two seem like you're having a good time. Why can't you just, just be happy for her? For both of us. Sure thing, Jake. It's your party. Get you something? Hate to see the groom walking around empty handed. Uh, I'm sorry, everyone. I think maybe we have one more speaker. Brother of the groom here just, ah... Just gotta say a couple of words. Just wanna say that I love my brother and I have always looked up to him. Right? I mean, he's, he is the good one, you know? He's-he's got the good grades, and, uh, and, uh, and varsity. Everything, I know, I did. You know, there was this one girl... And I was so crazy about her. So crazy about her. It could really hurt. And that's how I felt. And I-I couldn't imagine losing her, you know? Especially not to my brother. What I came up her for? I came up here to make a toast. To true love. Can't forget family all important. What the fuck is wrong with you? I had her first. Now you remember that. Oh! "Oh!" Hello? Young man? Hello. Anybody there? Young man? Are you okay? Young man? Are you okay? Jesus, Jake... Oh, you scared me. How did you get in? The window. I couldn't find my key. I'm glad you're okay. Where were you this whole time? It doesn't matter. The important thing is, now, I know... I see... It was all my fault. - What was your fault? - Everything. I'm gonna go get Isaac, okay? Sam, wait, just hear me out. Please, okay? I fucked up. I fucked up and, and I know I need help. Yeah, you've been, you've been trying to tell me... And I haven't been listening, but I'm... I'm listening now. Oh, Jake... I need you to know that I want things... I want to get us back to the way we were. Okay? I want to get us back to the way we were. - Okay. - Okay? - I'll do whatever it takes. - Okay. I'll do whatever you want. I'll get more counseling, I'll-I'll, I'll see Louis everyday if that's what it takes. Okay? Just-just... You just... Just-just tell me it's-it's, uh... It's-it's not too late for us. - Jacob. Jacob! - Tell me. Hey, hey. Hey, when did you... Jesus, where the hell have you been, Jacob? Isaac, just back off, alright? This is between me and Sam, please. What is? I'm trying... I'm trying to just save my marriage. Alright. How about-how about you and I take a walk, huh? Sam, just talk to me, please. Just... - She's my wife. - Oh! - Look... - What is it? Jake, listen... You're not married to Sam. You were never married to Sam. - I'm married to Sam. - No! - No! No! No! - Jake... God! Sam, tell him. Tell him. Tell him. - Jake, I'm telling you. - No! Jake! Jacob! Give me! Give me back! Give me back my watch. - Give me back my watch! - He's gonna make... Let him see it. He needs to see it. Jake, stop. Oh, my God. What is happening? I know it's hard, Jake. It's okay. - Oh, God! - It's okay. Oh, God! Hey, just hold on, okay? He's still breathing. Love and family. Take it easy. Okay? You're home now... Just take it easy. - Ooh! - Oh! - Jacob. - Hey!

No! - I'm not gonna... - You are. That's the thing, alright? I know all about the fucking HDA. Alright? It's not you. It's the drug. It's not Jacob. Alright? Isaac, it was nice. It was nice.

I'm not trying to kill anybody. Stop, Jake. Jake! Jake! I got you. You got your brother involved? You need help, Jake. He needs help. You're reconstructing HDA in this shit hole? I'm improving it, i-is actually what I'm doing. Your brother needs help. T-testing it on vets. I-it's destroying me. It's not perfect. I'm still working on it. I-I'm, I'm close. Just s-stop, stop! What the fuck is this stuff? - D-don't do that! - How many fucking... Jake? Jake? Hey, Jake. I've been trying to help you. No one was helping these guys. No one! No one helping you. No one cares. I-I-I'm the only one who's trying to do something. I'm the only one who's trying to help. I'm the one who's trying to find a cure. By turnin' our fuckin' vets into lab rats? No, I... He knew it wasn't safe. You knew about the side effects. What are you talking about? What are you... I made it work. Alright? I made... You, you begged me for it, Jake! You didn't wanna wait for the FDA. Anything to forget. Anything to forget. Everything will be different once it's finished. Hey, hey... I'm helping people. T-this is important. Do you not see how important this is? I'm shutting this down. Alright, Jake? You alright? Don't do that. I'm calling the cops. Fuck you. Put the phone down. We were wrong. What are you talking about? You knew about the side effects! Put the fucking phone down, man! Fuck you, you're done. It doesn't erase the memories. It replaces them with something worse. You're not calling the cops. Put the fucking phone down. - Fuck you! - It's killing people. We... we shouldn't have done it. We weren't helping anyone. Put the fucking phone down! Put the fucking phone down! Put the phone down! I'm gonna shoot you. Put the... Put the fucking phone down! No, Jake, no! No! No! Jake! You're okay. I'm sorry.
