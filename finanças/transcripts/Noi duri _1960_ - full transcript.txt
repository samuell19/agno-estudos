WE ARE HARD Hello? Hi, I'm Pat. Estoy in "Le Fric d'Afrique". I've found out who Nicole is. Listen to me well, Nicole is ... WHO IS PAT O'GUARDA, THE AMERICAN DEAD IN PIGALLE? BLOOD ON THE SIDEWALKS OF MONTMARTRE ANOTHER MURDER IN THE WORLD OF DRUGS NEW VICTIM IN THE STREET OF VICE I like punctual people. We are all like that in my family. If you want to follow me, the rest of the band is there. These are the men. Inspector Vichy, narcotics. Hello boys! Rest I'm an FBI agent ... ... but for the others I am just Fred Bombardone, conductor. This is how much the convent can offer, trusted men. We have chosen them from the band of the police force. Hmm, I think we'll make it. We have to hang out with suspicious people. But I think this system will work. Against drug trafficking, normal systems are not enough. I'm going to have to go back in time ... ... to remember my work as a musician. But I want to add two instruments: a guitar and a baritone sax. Well I have a guitarist. He's a jazz fanatic. It's called Robinot. - But it's assigned to traffic. - We will relieve him! A telegram must be sent quickly . - What do you think, boss? - Not bad! If we found a baritone sax ... He could be a colleague of mine, but he gives himself a few airs. Let it go! He's ignorant, he likes classical music , he won't want to play with us. - It works for me. - How is it not coming? We order it! Name and department. His name is Beaurivage, he's at headquarters, he stamps passports. ¡Bravo, Jerry Mulligan! How weird, they told me you didn't like jazz. Did Robinot tell you? I live for jazz! - Let's hope he doesn't find out! - Who? -The Jazz! -Very funny! Goodbye, Fred. Boys, tomorrow I want punctuality ?? ?? and please keep it a secret. Point in the mouth with everyone, including family. Good night, Fred. - Goodnight! - Goodnight! - We're late tonight. - Yes! - Be careful with your wife, who will sing you forty! -What do you say, boss? My wife is sweet, sensitive, understanding. He knows how to listen to me. And most importantly, she is eternally in love. I hate you! - I hate you! - Look, Genzianetta ... - No! - I'd like to clarify. - No! - I do not! - Why not! - I repeat with the greatest calm in the world ... - Don't yell at me! Comfortable service, huh? Now you also go to the nightclubs! ¡Go al cabaret! ¡Te has converted into a worldly vividor, that's life! - It is a special, secret mission, I receive orders -Yes, orders ... - You must have volunteered! - Do not say foolishness! I can't stand the atmosphere at night, with all that smoke! All those blondes that slowly undress ... ... piece by piece, one meter from your nose ... # Do you want to come with me to the cabaret ... # # ... to an unbridled orgy. # That's it. Genzianetta, this doesn't make sense! And don't make those gestures in front of the child! I don't even look at those women! And people who get naked in public annoys me! Do you remember the impression Grandpa Amilcare made on me ... ... when crossing the hall in your underwear? Grandpa Amilcare! I think! All because of this damn guitar! Is it my fault if in music I triumph ... ... good hearing and rhythm in the blood? # Dad, Dad dad, dad dad, I get it, dad dad dad # # Father, Father father, father father # The cha cha cha I'm going to give you one of these nights! Napoleone, daddy love, do you also have the rhythm in your blood? - Salty, huh? - Very salty! - And little cheerful, let's go somewhere else. -Yes! Goodnight. - Don't take your eyes off her, Snow White! - Do not hesitate! Do you want a flower? They are fragrant, you know. Is not true? - All yours. - Thanks a lot. How handsome! Hmm! But... With a whiskey, nothing like a good cigar. But we are in the country of toys! There are only dolls! - I do not have change. - I haven't asked. Come here, doll! Hey! Do you smile only at those who give you dollars? - I met a guy who took off his suspenders. -And that? Now he no longer takes them off. - Do you want me to hit you? -Yes. This is a serious venue, no fights allowed! - And who is he fighting? - Ugly things happen to him. - Spooky! I'm shaking! - Oh yeah? Quiet! Enough already, go! Nothing has happened. Orchestra! - Hello. - Hello. - I'm Barbara. - Hmm. - This is Monique. - Ah. I am Fred. - And I'm in charge here. - Ah, then I gladly obey! You look like an easy dollar man . It seems to me that you are also easy to handle. Anyway, there is one thing that I always have easy. - I bet it's the whiskey. - You said it, sister! - Three. - I invite. It is the custom of the house. Duty of hospitality. And the owner is me. - Also from the doll? - Yes. -Well ... In that case ... For what you like. Health! I have never known if it is drunk to forget or to remember. And those who drink to drink? Maybe, but there is always a reason. Hey boss! This is a desert! How absurd an empty place! When there are people it looks like a fair booth , flooded with light. And when people leave, only the booth remains. But while it's open you can have a whiskey. Just by drinking. - No. At the bottom of that glass you are looking for an illusion too. -Me? # You can see it at the bottom of a glass ... # # ... an illusion that I can't forget. # # Every night I have to find you ... # # ... in my sky full of bars. # # You can see it at the bottom of a glass ... # # ... sweet lips that I can't kiss anymore. # # I want to lose myself and dream ... # # ... until sadly it continues to shine ... # # ... the horizon of each bar. # # At first... # # ...I do not see you... # # too much whiskey separates me from you. # # Then I drink and little by little ... # # ... you appear to me and you are everything to me. # # See you at the bottom of a glass ... # # ... until the dawn in the sky appears. # # And at dawn desperate I will return home sadly ... # # ... to wait for the night and to be able to see you again ... # # ... at the bottom of a glass ... # # ... in the sky of the bar. # Whoops! If this was your job, I would hire you. - It's my job. - Fantastic! Barbara, make him a contract right now! Nothing of that! I'm on vacation in Paris. My orchestra is finishing a recording in London ... ... and in two days we will fly to Broadway. What if the salary was good? Anything is possible, but I 'm not in charge of these matters. It is my agent who is in charge. Have you had enough or do you need another? No, I am a teetotaler. One glass is enough for me to go. The last. Good night, dolls. - To catch you, how can we? - Hey, uh, I'm a shark! What is your agent's name? - Bernabeux and lives at the Grand Hotel. - Mmm, good to know. I would gladly work here. There is such a .. ...family. - Do you think so? -It seems to me. - Goodbye. - Bye! Bye! Rest assured, Excellency, everything will be fine. The drug operation is in good hands. - I congratulate you, Mr. Prefect. - Thank you, Excellency. If you want, you can check it yourself. Why not? Let's go. The men are training in the narcotics section. - Well, let's see it. - Please. Inspector Vichy has entrusted the action to confident, serious men ... ... aware of the seriousness of their mission. Tough men, ready for anything ... ... who have been involved with great determination and seriousness. - Please. - Thank you. ¡Firms! Thank you, teacher, it's okay. Hello, Terpsichore. The music bows reverently. Can't wait to get hired to make fun of me? And if so, would you lose your job? On second thought, I think not. Forgives. I'm in a hurry to take a shower and change for the night. Meeting each other and saying goodbye is like the end of a novel. Or like the beginning. The businessman is with Barbara ... ... and they both intend to hire you. - I know, I'm here for that. - Bye. -Bye. - Hey baby! - Why the visit? I have a terrible longing for your Blunderbuss. Here is your favorite brand. Luckily I still have one left! Only one? You better order a truck with a trailer. I have the impression that I will smoke a lot here. Barbara has decided to hire me. - As a smoker? - No, as a conductor. # You're beautiful... # # ...when you talk to me. # # You're beautiful... # # ...when you look at me. # # You seduce me and maybe you don't know ... # # ...you're beautiful. # # What a sweet dream you are ... # # ...when you kiss me. # # You will kill me ... # # ... I like you so much. # # Look me in the eye and maybe you understand ... # # ...you're beautiful. # # I hold you tight in my arms ... # # ... and you tremble, I hear you sigh. # # You abandon yourself, like this, without speaking. # # I kiss you and I lose myself in you. # # What a sweet dream you are ... # # ...when you kiss me. # # You will kill me ... # # ... I like you so much. # - # Look into my eyes ... # - # ... and maybe you understand ... # #... you're beautiful. # But you are Doris Day disguised as a cigarette saleswoman! Hopefully! But I sell cigarettes, cigars ... The tobacco route, huh? It is a route like any other. But this one is full of cigarette butts only. The important thing is to know how to change at the right time. I have tried to change everywhere. But when one is alone like me ... ... without help and with so many sad things on my back ... But why do I tell you those things? - # What a sweet dream you are ... # - # ... when you kiss me. # - # You will kill me ... # - # ... I like you so much #. - # Look into my eyes ... # - # ... and maybe you understand ... # #... you're beautiful. # ¡Eh, Fred! - What happens? -All okay, I have signed the contract. Bernabeux, old dromedary ... ... have you not fallen into a trap with those two beauties? Calling a 200-ticket-a-night contract cheating ? All in order! We don't see tomorrow at the office. - Sorry, work calls me. - Please. He also calls me, but I will turn a deaf ear. What if we make a propitiatory toast ? Come on! Hmm! Agree! Goodbye. This is not included in the contract, it is reserved for friends. How beautiful is friendship! By the most sympathetic conductor. - Where you live? - At the Ritz. But now that I work here, if I found a place in these parts ... There's a room upstairs, right? Yes, it is an idea. So I could keep an eye on you better. - Well, we have a new roommate! - Don't worry, I haven't said yes yet. - How is the service here? - The best! Flame pancakes and end of the evening love. Ah, l'amour! Another thing that is quite easy for me. What if we talk a little business? - When you start? - I think tomorrow night. An afternoon audition with the orchestra and we took off. For your successes. - For our successes. - Ma'am, it's Michel. Michel, have you heard from Pierre and the others? Fool! You have to find them at all costs! The Algerian can arrive at any moment. - Find me Pierre. - Business. Get away! If you can't make it appear, you'll ... Idiots! I'm surrounded by idiots! # We are tough, with dark dark faces . # # We cast long shadows on the walls. # # We are tough. # # Women, we love strange women ... # # ... with absurd tight skirts. # # What women! # # With a striped suit and a gun in his vest ... # # ... in each game we risk our lives. # # Whoever seeks a fight on the spot will have it. # # So! # # We are tough, but deep down we are pure ... # # ... and we make them in all colors. # # We are tough. # # We are tough ... # # ... we are not always out. Slipping down dark alleys ... # # ... we go back to mom ... # # ... that will put us to bed. # # We are tough. # - Not bad that Fred! - If I didn't like it, I wouldn't be here. But I have other things on my mind. I wait for Michel. I have to do a job with him. - Something wrong? - No, but please ... ... take care of the club. -Yes. - I have received a telegram from the Algerian. I should be here tonight. - Ma'am ... - Finally. - And what's new? - We have one who knows something. - Have you sung? -Not yet, we are waiting for you to work on it. There is no time to lose, you have to release him before the Algerian arrives. I'm going. - Will it take long? - I don `t believe. - But if the Algerian arrives, do him the honors of the house. -It's okay. Come on, Michel. - This is the last one you sell me. - You go? If you just debuted. No, I'm not leaving for the moment. Listen to me... ... are you a brave girl? - I think yes because? - Would you sing two songs every night? - Please don't tease me. If you think this is a joke in good taste ... I'm never kidding about work. So it is true? Congratulations Fred, your style I like to die! - But I see that you're still alive. - I'm serious! - But excuse me, maybe annoying. - Absolutely. The customer served, the cigarette case leaves. It is the rule of the house. I'm sorry, I didn't know there was tenderness between you. I treat all women with tenderness. Then hug me tenderly and let's dance. I dont see why not. You are the kind of doll that I like right now. We could meet later. Why don't you come see me? I would go, I would go, but I can't. Barbara has gone out and tonight comes to the big boss. - Who, the boss of the boss? - Yes, that smart guy full of money. - And what is the name of that smartass? - Nobody knows his name ... ... but everyone calls him "the Algerian". -Mmm ... Arrival of flight 46 from Algiers. Boss, I'm not calm. - With everything in the suitcases ... - Neither do I. But here you have to use cunning. Watch Dear captain, how are you? I was hoping to see him! I see you very well! Cross our fingers! It's great! - Do you know me? - No. - But I'm not a captain. - Oh no? -No. - You haven't been made captain yet? - No. - And you haven't complained? - No. - What injustice! This man is not yet a captain. - If I were your superior, I would make you general! -Thank you. - And it would be justice! - Thank you. - Bye. - What do you mean, see you later? - Salameleque. -What about salameleque? Let me see your bags. - Show him the suitcases. - He has seen them. It is done. No, open them, I have to see inside. - That's all. -That's all. - There is nothing missing. - We have checked them before disembarking. -But I have to see them. - That's curious. - It is my duty. - Where was he? Where were you? - Here. -He hasn't moved. - Who? -He. -Does matters? - You said "where". No, I said "duty". My duty, I must see inside. That is lack of education. Allow me, bordering on rudeness. When an honest man with a fez says there is nothing extraordinary ... ... you have to take their word for it. If not, what is the word of honor worth? This is invasion of privacy! It's going to make me mad! What does? Do you want to tease me? Come on, a document! A document! - If he gets mad ... - Oh ... Huh? - A document. -What? - A document. - You? - What do you mean me? - What does he want? -A document! - Ah, a document! -Yes. - Anyone? -Yes. - Said it before! - Oh, let's see what it's about. One moment, calm down. "Spaghetti with tomato" ... But this is a menu! For me it is a document. It is a way of looking at it. - The passport -Which one? -Yours. - Yours? -No, yours. - Mine? -Yours. -Mine? - Yes, yours. - Do you want to see it? Have you seen it? - No, I have to read it! - This bureaucracy! - So is. "Abdullah Wir Omar". We Omar We Omar. - # Wir Omar how handsome he is! # - Thank you, I know that one! Do you know this one? # O sole mio # Sing it. - # O sole mio # - # ¡Te diré oh-oh-oh! # - Enough. But what is this, the varieté? - I thought you liked ... - But let me read! - Read. - "Attaché of the Moroccan Embassy." - Eh? -Aggregate. - What have you added? -Yes, attaché from the Moroccan Embassy. - Has added? - Added. - I haven't added anything. - You, added. -No, you have attacked. - Have I added? -Did you add it? - I was quiet. Then you have added it. - No, added. -Who added it? - Attaché of the Embassy! -Me? - Yes - Have I added the Embassy? You see double! Don't make me angry! Embassy Attaché, put it here! - Who put it? - But how? Who has dared to write that I have added? I have not added anything to anyone! If you have a uniform, I have a coat! - You are attaché of the Embassy! - Ah! Can't read, let me. - Yes, I am an attaché of the Embassy. - Oh! I understand. - That's my mission. - Mail? - I can talk? -Mail - Newspaper from Italy. Hush! - I understand. Diplomatic secret. - Bravo. -Diplomatic... Sorry, I have to open the suitcase. We have been informed of the arrival of a gangster. - Yes? -Yes. -And you want to find it in my suitcase? That's enough! Do you want to drive me crazy? - Do you want to go crazy? - Yes. - Then come back. - How? -He wants to go back ... -No ! You drive me crazy! Then I should say, "It drives me crazy." Anyway, do you want to open that suitcase? - Look, I don't want to be a snitch, but you make me do it. -What? At the Embassy we know everything, down to the smallest detail. The gangster you are looking for ... Do you see that gentleman? - Where are you? Watch my back. - I'm watching her. - That gentleman in the gray coat. - That? -Yes. Disguise. He is the gangster. In order not to attract attention, make a mark on the suitcase, like this. - It is done? -Yes. - Do this too. Now, discreetly, me and my assistant are leaving. - And I don't take my eyes off him. - Bravo. - As soon as we turn the corner ... - What will they do? -U.S... And I don't take my eyes off him. - Captain? -Yes? -Nice job. - Bye thank you. - Keep an eye on him. - Yes thanks. Hey, take this man and search him. Register it. Enough, enough! Silence! Take it away! I thought he was going to fool me! But we know everything! Welcome, boss. Have a seat. - Barbara won't be long. - Thank you. - Ali ... -I'm here, boss. - Ali ... - What do you want, boss? I smell a stench. - Won't it be you? - No, but what does it smell like? - Dead mice. -No, it will be Barbara who has perfumed the apartment. - Yes? -Yes. - Stinky perfume, right? - Give it to me, I'll hang it up. - Do it. -Yes. - Turn on the light. -Right now. - Turn it on! Quick! I do not know where it is! Ah yes, here it is. - And good? -There are people here. - And who are these? - They're from our band. - If true. -Come on guys! What are you doing here? I go in and they don't stand up? Hey, wake up! By the beard of the prophet! I'm going to wake them up. - They must have drunk. - Oh yeah? Now you will see. But co ... I mean ... Wow! But they are dead! - They are cold cuts. -What? -Meats. - Nah, they're dead men! - Exactly. - They are dead corpses. -Yes. - Who played this joke on me? - I dont know... Who played this prank on me? I strangle it! What's going on? Hello, boss, welcome. You ask me what happens? By the body of a thousand Mohammedans! How many times do I have to say that I don't want corpses at home? A massacre in the living room bothers me, makes me nauseous! - Besides, I'm allergic to the dead! - Jacques, Pépé and Pierre ... ... they were the best men in the band. Hi nicole? Everything is going well. The Algerian has received our business card. How? Okay, good night. We know that there are two bands. The first is directed by Barbara and the Algerian. - And the other? - The other is complete darkness. It's run by a certain Nicole, but we don't know anything else. You have to persevere. - Well, how are the boys? - Well well. In one thing they are not very easy, the striptease. By force, with those blondes who get naked at half a meter! Well, you have to remain indifferent! Real night club musicians are used to that show. Lieutenant Bombardone is right, a small detail is enough to betray himself. You have to get used to that kind of show. I have an idea. May I, Inspector? Switchboard? The vice squad. Hello? Yes, we arrested five half an hour ago. How? But the regulation does not foresee ... Yes sir. Immediately. Girls, all to Inspector Vichy's office ! There is a trustworthy job for you. - What do you mean a little job? - We work on our own! - Soak you up for damage! - Let's go! The investigations are proceeding with enthusiasm. The men work with commendable effort. - You can check it yourself. Please. -Thank you. Attention! # What a sweet dream you are .. # # when you kiss me. # # You will kill me ... # # ... I like you so much. # # Look me in the eye and maybe you understand ... # # ...you're beautiful. # Robinot, have you never seen a pee hunter? - Sure, but never with my wife's face ! -Hey? That is my wife, she has come to create problems for us! It will succeed if you don't stop it soon! Shoot, Robinot! Intercept it and send it home. If you talk to someone ... ... we're screwed. Shoot! - Shoot, shoot, shoot ... Chin Chin! For success! - Excited? -If much. - I also. I already told you. Did you hear the ovation? I owe it all to you. And when will you leave? In the clipper there is also room for you. I'm taking you in tow. "Fred and Joysette." Imagine the sign on Broadway! - A cigarette? - Thank you. How elegant! Nice, huh? Can you tell me your name, please? - Mr. Serafino Álvarez de Mendoza y de García. -What? Don Serafino Álvarez de Mendoza y de García. - Don Serafino Álvarez de Mendoza ... ... and García! -Very friendly. - Don Serafino Álvarez de Mendoza y de García on the phone! -But it's me! - Are you Don Serafino Álvarez de Mendoza y de García? -Yes -On the phone. What a setback! You cannot be calm. Forgive me, my dear. I go back and forth right away. See, Serafino, that your little golden star ... ... from here it doesn't move. - You rascal! Very beautiful! - Do you want to see how the golden star moves ? Follow me -No! - Follow me, we'll talk later. - Do not touch me! - Beautiful, huh? - Yes very beautiful. -Crazy! Over here please. Fred, we have problems. Barbara is not ... ... and Ciclamino says that the vice squad is at the door ... ... asking for documentation. - And I am an illegal immigrant! - I also! What can be done? - There is an exit to the alley, right? - But that's how we fall into his arms. Do you think they don't know that way out? I'll take care of it, come with me! I wonder if you are not crazy. With that one, with all those wiggles ... What a denatured mother! While I sacrifice myself! Ah, do you sacrifice yourself? You enjoy it! Guitar suits you, huh? Meanwhile, you spend your nights at the cabaret together with those ... ... say, gentlemen. I work, I sacrifice, I try to give our son a future! - I also! -You are right. - But what are you saying? Long! Also, do you know what I'm saying? This life intoxicates me and I don't care about your police friends! Are you crazy? Why are you yelling? No one should know that I am a policeman! Ah, here is my beloved sweetheart. - No one was on the phone. - Oh, what a "pain"! - Do you hear the cha cha cha? -I hear. - Let's Dance! -Let's go! - Good, right? - Yes, not bad. ¡Fred! Boss, I didn't make it. That one doesn't want to leave. Look at her! - Go back to the orchestra and trust me. - Can I trust you? Yes Yes. - Inspector Cremont, vice squad. - Ahead. Inspector... I really don't get it. - Come with me. - What does he want? I repeat that you come with me. There must be a mistake, I am a lady! Sir, a Spanish gentleman will not allow! Shut up or I'll throw you out, too. This being the case, a Spanish gentleman allows. And you call yourself a gentleman! Don't touch me, how dare you? He does not know who I am. This is intolerable! It is necessary to clarify this situation right now! Don't allow yourself so much confidence! This has never happened to me! I can walk alone! Over here, girls. It is safer. Thus we do not progress. Drug trafficking is constantly decreasing. This year I have earned 200 million francs less than last year. I don't know where we're going to end up! It's not my fault! We have lost almost all the men! They will need to be replaced. Hey, what about that Fred Bombardone? - Bombardone? - Hmm. - Can we trust him? - He has got rid of all the corpses! - It has been detached ... - Of all the corpses. -Ah, it's true. What restlessness that Bombardone has taken from us! - Just a moment! That is not him? - Oh yeah. Yes it's him. Accompanied by two men? Two handsome young men. - What did you say? - Let us approach slowly. I want to see what they do. Are you happy, girls? Old Fred's tricks always work! You are a love, you deserve a kiss. - Give it to me. - Take it. Dammit! We are fine! See how sometimes appearance is deceptive! At first glance it seems perfectly ... ...a man. But instead ... Guys, what an exuberance! - AHA! It is bilateral! -How? - Can't you see how it turns? To the right, to the left ... You have to watch him more closely! Up close ... how crazy! You have to watch it, but ... ...from far! - Annoying? - Not at all. - Salam. - Salameleque. -Salam. Dear Bombardone, first of all ... ... I congratulate you on the cadaverous cleanliness. Bravo, you were magnificent! - Thank you. Bombardone system. - You see the style. It is seen that you are an intelligent man. A man ... A man ... Smart, only. Listens... ... Bombardone mine, don't be surprised to see me here at this hour. The purpose of my visit is there. I come to propose to give you a ... How do you say? - A hit. - One hit, very good. - And if you finish that ... - Blow. -... knock... ... I am sure that tomorrow you will satisfy me that ... -Hit! I'll give you the blow, you Bedouin! Have you not understood that you should shut up when I speak? Excuse him, he's ignorant. I'm sure I 'll be so looking forward to tomorrow ... ... to strengthen relationships with you ... How do you say? - Intimate. -¡Imas intimate! Bravo, Bombardone, intimate. Eh? No, no, make no mistake. He was talking about business relations. - Clear. Well, what is it about? - Let's sit. Well, it's about ... ... from a safe. - Good. I have the easy safe. Ah, but this one is not easy. No, because it is the police safe . Do you understand - You'll ask me why. - Why? -What are you getting into? He has to ask me. Ask me why - Why? - That's right, he said it. Because tomorrow night ... ... in the police safe will be the pay of all the Paris agents. ¡Por Alá! I could have struck earlier, but I knew at the time ... ... that this month there would be a salary increase for the agents. That is why I have decided. Is it clear? Yes, the matter interests me, but first I want to know ... ... how the loot is divided. - Ah, what is fair is fair. As that old Siam proverb says : "Give Caesar the Siamese sisters." - It doesn't seem like that to me. - No, huh? Me neither. But I've already said it. Okay, boss, okay. But what interests me above all are men. I had forgotten. I knew it. - Do it yourself, organize it as you want. - Good. - I'll take my boys, we understand each other well. -Very well. If you allow me, out of charity, for Allah to strike me down, it is not for lack of confidence ... ... but I can give you a hand, I'll send you a few of my own. It's okay. - I could go. - They would arrest you immediately. Dear Bombardone, you and I will do great things. - We will go very far. - I'm sure. - Ali! -I'm here. - Ali. -Let's go. - Ali! -I'm here. - Ali. -Yes Yes. Bombardone, may Allah protect you! Salam! - Salam. -Salameleque. - ¡Ali! Ali. But! Commissioner Vichy? I am Fred. Take good note of the message. As the Algerian and his band have full confidence in me ... ... I have to embark on another great coup. Yes, bigger than the corpses. Tomorrow night I'm going to rob the police safe. But what does Robinot do? We had an appointment at the exact time. - I think it's coming. - It was time! Hi boss. Do you also bring the child? Do you think you go to a public park? When I hear you speak like that I would go away! Do you want me to leave it alone at home? My wife is still cool. Getting her inside was easy ... ... getting it out is difficult! So we take the child, let's do the robbery with the child. - What's wrong with it? - Let's hope it goes well. Come on! - Turn on the light. - Turn on the light! Shhh! Eh, Cyclamen, sustain me for a moment to la criatura. - I go? - Opens. - Silencer. -Muffler. - Silencer. -Silence! -Silence! Attention, attention: to all police cars ... ... keep strictly away from the plant. Cars that need to return will be delayed for at least one hour. I repeat, they will be delayed at least an hour. Hello? Hello? I have not understood anything, the radio must be faulty. Let's go back to headquarters. You know I don't smoke. Well dissolved? On medium heat? - Ready, boss. - Okay, guys. It's done. ¡Robinot! I'm coming, boss. Ciclamino, take care of him. - I'm hungry. - What delicious porridge! - Solid? - Unfortunately.

There has been an unprecedented robbery at the police station. The thieves took from the safe ... ... the sensational figure of 37 million ... - Do you appreciate the style? Very good, Bombardone! It's useless. I've always said it, when these Americans come in ... ... are the aces. - Was he right or not? - And how! - I was going to say it too. - Shut up! Ignorant! It is understood? It is not spoken. Oh! Dammit! I got burned because of you! ¡"Inalfabeto"! What a fantastic man! - Who? - Our Bombardone! Oh yeah? Is he a fantastic man? - I scratch you, you know? -What? - What? Forget this. I have to talk to you about business. Get rid of this woman ... ... well it's a woman! - What am I? Let us begin. Get out! Which has been? Now listen to me. - You will go home immediately ... - To my house! What a house of mine, my house! - You will leave immediately for casa coso ... - Casamicciola. Yes, we sent you there to make mud, okay? Do you want to shut up? You will leave immediately for Casablanca. - For what? - What for what? - Heroin, right? - Who, Joan of Arc? Yes, Anna Magnani! The heroin, the drug! - Ah, the drug! - Are we drug addicts or not? - I know the gender. - Dammit! You will debut with your orchestra ... ... in another of my nightspots. - In which? - At the Naizimbumbo. Naizimbumbo. Do you want to stop doing the goat? - Excuse me, you don't understand Arabic. - Why, do you understand Arabic? Oh! - In the "Golden Date." - In the "Golden Date." Listens... ... during your stay in Casablanca ... ... you will be approached by one of my men who will deliver the merchandise ... ... and you will bring her here. Is it clear? Is that all or do I have to do a double somersault? If you're not careful, Interpol will give it to you. I already know those. But who is the guy? - Ali! -Hey? - The photo! -Yes. - Here. -Quick. Taking. - Oh! - But this is the Marilyn. - The Monroe? -Yes. - But how, do you have the Monroe in your pocket? -I have made a mistake. Make no mistake! Stupid. Nap. Do you know him? You like? Yes, it's Joe Nicotina. I've had dealings with him. Oh yeah? Also with him. Bombardone ... Oh! Fred: This is Joe Nicotina, one of the worst in Chicago. I've already spanked him twice, but if he sees me ... ...there will be problems. - You let me? A good guy! Fine, distinguished ... He seems rather short and puny. - What? He is tall and robust. - Ah, tall and robust! Strange how photos can deceive! I am quite tall in the photos. - Instead you're short. -Yes. - So you are going to Casablanca? - How are you "doing"? We are leaving. - You mean I'll go too? - Of course, you are my singer! - I'd like to be something else. - Really? -AHA. Then I'll tell you that we moved our love to Casablanca. - You like? - Oh, Fred! -Go away. I have an idea... - Have you ever acted? - Yes, as a child, in the parish. - As was? - Not so bad. The priest always told me: "you will become an artist." In Casablanca you will have to play a role. - What paper? - Young actor, romantic ... Uprooted, arrogant. Seductive, vicious. Evil. Ironic. - AHA! Not bad! Do you accept? - Yes Yes. Yes, you will see. # Some like Fred, yes, but why is not known. # # They like. They like it to death. # # If someone likes Fred, well, what are you going to do? # # They are the women, who love me. # # If anyone likes Fred, well, here I am. # # No roses, just thorns. I read crime stories to the end. # # I even drink whiskey at the movies. If they look for me, they find me. # # Some like Fred, yes. What happens? Does it bother you? # # I am surly, but nice. # # If anyone likes Fred, well, I'm here. # - Psst! Is under. - I already saw it. You go on and smoke. - Irritates me! - Smoke! # With the curves I delight ... # # ... I always take them in fourth gear. # # I drink everything without ice and women understand me. # # Some like Fred, yeah, what's up? Does it bother you? # # I am surly, but nice. # # Some like Fred, Hmm. Some like Fred, yes. # # If anyone likes Fred, well, I'm here. # # I'm here. # # You're beautiful... # #... when you talk to me. # # You're beautiful... # # ...when you look at me. # # You seduce me and maybe you don't know ... # # ...you're beautiful. # So it's clear. Listen well... ... you are me, Fred Bombardone from Chicago, Illinois. -Agree. There is no time to lose. But be careful, he's a very tough guy. His name is Joe Nicotina, nicknamed ... ... "the pincers". - And why is that? When he shakes your hand, he destroys it. # ... you will understand how pretty you are. # # You hold me tight in your arms ... # # ... and I tremble, I hear you sigh. # # I abandon myself ... # I repeat, do not screw up. On amiga if llama Milly "la gata", "la gata". - Okay, "the cat"! - Tell him about her, create atmosphere. - We're? - What do you have in your eye? Nothing, try to understand me! - Who will it be? -Who? It's him, you idiot! - He? The one with the little hand? -Yes! - I'm here in the shower room. -Agree. -Agree. Young man, hey! Ahead! Sit down. - Who you are? - Joe Nicotine. - References? - 10 years in Sing-Sing. - There is good air over there. - Ah! You like to spend the summer. - And you, are you Fred Bombardone? - You said it, brother. Give me your hand. You have to catch up, the handshake in Europe is old-fashioned. Not in America. I sign all contracts with a handshake. Well then things change. And how is your girl, Milly "the hare"? - Milly what? - How stupid! Milly "the stork"! - Milly what? - Milly ... ¿Y? ¿Milly? - Meow! -Milly "the cat"! - Fine thanks. Let's get back to business. The Algerian brought me the loot and I give you the merchandise. We are honest people! I've never doubted it! Hurry up with these cameras and put them in the right place. Here in half an hour you will not be able to circulate. Do you expect a lot of public? Imagine, that Bombardone is the hit of the day. Tonight he performs after his tour of Casablanca. Good times! Ahead! Hello, do you know that tonight we will be televised? Yes, so everyone will see you, you will become a star and I will lose you. Never. - There's one thing I don't understand. - The what? Why are you tied to the car of the Algerian and Barbara? Someone like you doesn't need certain friendships. - Friends? And because? - Because I'm scared for you. This is a dangerous life. You've seen the end of Perry and the others. And that of that American, Johnny. - Pat, her name was. - Oh yeah? I thought Johnny, I call all Americans that. Less you. Hey Fred! From the boss that the TV guy wants to talk to you. Tell him I'm going right now. Now go, little one. I'm down right away. The whole of Paris will see his place tonight - Hopefully everything turns out to be frank. -Of course. Fred, this is the director for the last details. - Hello. - Hello. - What time does it start? - When you are ready with your orchestra. In fact, in exactly half an hour. If you allow me, I will give the last orders. - Until now. - Until now. - Dear Bombardone, Joan of Arc? - Upstairs in my room. - No! -Yes! - All good? -All good. - ¿Okay? - ¡Okay! - Follow me! Ali! - I'm here. -Let's go! However I put it here a minute ago. If you want to joke, I warn you that this is not my system. Young man, let's get down to business. I have made you a druggist ... ... but if you think you can be smart with me, you are wrong! Because if there's a ready here, that's me! Je suis! N'est-ce pas? It is 23:30. If you don't bring me the merchandise before midnight ... ... I will blow up the druggist with the entire drugstore. - I speak clearly? -Speak clearly. - I have spoken clearly. Half an hour of time, huh? - Okay. - ¿Okay? - I said okay! - Ah good. Let it roll. Here, guys! Listen - Do you see this face? - Yes, what's so weird about it? It's an idiot face! The merchandise has been swiped right under my nose! - And who was it? - The magician Baku! The Algerian is beside himself, he wants her in half an hour. - So what do we decide? - I do not know yet. But let's do one thing: ... we started playing together, and then you continue with Joysette ... ... and I'll go to work. I'm pretty sure the merchandise hasn't left the store yet. - Do we have to arm ourselves? - I think so. I have the impression that tonight will be hot. Have you heard, boys? Arm! - Are you doing well? - Yes. Custom. - Loaded? - Loaded. What's going on? Nothing, I prepare one of my musical-criminal numbers . - Fred, what's up? - There is someone who wants to be very smart. But you better be careful, I don't want anything to happen to you. - Don't worry, I'm not afraid. - I do. There is no courage without fear. It's about beating it. Like in Guadalcanal when you were a Marine? Yes, as in Guadalcanal. Hurry up, guys, we're on the air. Come on, Mr. Fred. Please. Let's go guys! Hurry up! Ahead. - I see some faces out there ... - Could be Nicole's. We have to catch Fred and the others before they leave. Cyclamen, come on! Take this to the teacher, please. It will serve you for the cigarette song . Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our program continues ... ... with the announced connection to "Le Fric d'Afrique" ... ... to introduce you to Fred Bombardone and his orchestra. With you Fred Bombardone! # We are tough, with dark dark faces . # LOAD IT Nicole # We are tough. # # Women, we love strange women ... # # ... with absurd tight skirts. # # What women! # # With a striped suit and a gun in his vest ... # # ... in each game we risk our lives. # # Whoever seeks a fight on the spot will have it. # # So! # # We are tough, but deep down we are pure ... # # ... and we make them in all colors. # # We are tough. # # We are tough ... # # ... we are not always out. Slipping down dark alleys ... # It's a song from the crime series. This Bombardone has created a new genre. # ... will put us in. # - Paris! What a show he can give! - It's neorealism. But these are serious! Hello, Ciclamino. Hey, Ciclamino, are you being funny? Ah! Ah, we are among friends! Down with the submachine gun. Raise your arms. Disarm it. - The stab always in the back! - You better shut up. Down, guys, it's yours. Reduce it and let's take it to the Algerian. You'll calm down, Fred. Treacherous poisonous snakes must be crushed. Isn't it, Monique? Raise your hands too, pretty girl! I do not understand. Aren't these the cigarettes you prefer ... ... and what do you usually send in honor of friends like him? Would you like a cigarette? Ah, very good! Here we are all all all! There is also you. Good! Very good, little girl. EU! Dear Bombardone, what now? Have we decided or not to deliver that blessed merchandise? I told you, I don't have it! He has to believe him, I answer for him. Oh yeah? All right, sonny. And who are you, if it can be known? - His right arm. - Silence! - With the mouth! -With the ... - Silence! Well, mon cher, under the circumstances ... ... and much to my regret, I feel obliged to refer the matter to lethal ways. Death tickled me at least 100 times when I was in the Marines! In the Marines ... Listens... ... I offer you a deal. And do you think that I let myself be convinced by a drink ... ... either whiskey or pomace? I have said a barter, an exchange! Give me an hour.. and I'll bring you the merchandise. - Don't trust it. - I do not trust. Why, what do you have to fear? I leave you my boys as hostages. If I haven't returned within an hour, you can do as you like. - Perfect, I'm going with you. - Silence with your mouth, I said! Let me think. Yes I accept. Let go of his hands. - Both? - And why just one? -Both! Look, golden angel. It's 3:25. If you don't come back in an hour, your friends ... ... they will all die! Agree. Give me a car and a gun. - Give him what he wants and let him go. - Do you understand? Easy, guys. I will be back soon. I beg you to be punctual. Well, we are not among savages, we are decent people. For two minutes or so ... No one is going to die. Hey, no, wait. Two minutes late will mean your death. Like Guadalcanal, when he was in the Marines. To kill time, waiting for your death ... ... I want to explain the operation of this mortal machine of my invention. - As you can see, here we have a tap. Ali? Hey? - Show them the tap. - This is. -That is. This tap gives water. Water fills this glass container . The container, as it increases in weight, falls and raises this candle. What is the candle for? - Illuminates when power is missing. - Your aunt's current! When your aunt's power goes out, I'll blind you in one eye! Tché! Excuse me It serves to burn this rope that, when it breaks, drops a weight ... ... of two kilos. Ali? -Chief? - Show them the weight of two kilos. -Yes. - 2 kg, gentlemen. - Here. -Two kilograms. This weight, when it falls, where will it fall? Unfortunate! You idiot, you bastard! This weight is going to fall on this pedal. This pedal, receiving the impulse of the weight, releases a dog. What does a dog do when it gets loose? - Bark! - Bark. It does not bark! I'll line you up with them, if you don't let me! - What does? - Doesn't bark, worse. As the rope is stretched, it causes a bullet to be fired ... ... of this little pistol, that traveling this trajectory ... ... will hit the center of this target. What do you put in the barrel? "Explosive". So... ... you can already imagine the consequences of the explosion. Is it clear? Did you understand? Sorry, I have not understood the mechanism of the thing well. Would you mind repeating it again? Wasting time? You're kidding? Do you want me to repeat the lesson? You are here to die! - Leave me for October. - But what October? Silence, for God's sake! U expel them all! I was waiting for you, Nicole. Keep your hands still, my revolver is enough! I want to see your face, Nicole. Come closer. Sit in that chair, I have prepared it for you. Because you are Nicole. Fred, but I'm Joysette. Ah! Also Pat, the one you say was called Johnny. Sit down! If you come to get things ... ... that you stole from me and that you hid in the piano ... ...you're late. I got there first. You're beautiful. Once upon a time there was a girl as beautiful as an angel. It was the cigarette case from a nightclub. She was fighting alone against destiny, her name was Joysette. Then a hard appeared ... ... with the heart of meringue ... ... and immediately fell like an idiot. She and everyone thought he was a crazy jazz musician ... ... and instead, he was an FBI agent ... ... like my friend Pat, whose name was Johnny! And only you could know. You killed him, right? You got him out of the way because he found out that you were Nicole! He was absolutely right. I picked the wrong track, but a photograph betrayed you. Yes, I was a Marine in Guadalcanal, but I never told you! The photo was among the things in the drawer you stole! That is why you wanted to come to Casablanca with me. Nerd. I did it because I love you. Quiet! You can no longer talk about love. People like you ... ... it's better to get it out of the way. Why, you don't like me anymore? Hold me in your arms like before. Kiss Me. I'm yours. I'm yours. This is Nicole. - And here is the merchandise. -Bravo! - I carry it. Let's hurry up! Going! - Who has a match? - Nobody. - Me! - Thank God! Where here? No, maybe here. No, it has none! - I thought I had! - Oh yeah? Did you do it to make fun of me? Do you think you can make fun of me? I try to buy time! We are human beings! Humans! Don't do that, it hurts. My heart shrinks. When I see that someone suffers, I would give my life! - How is it possible that you fear death at your age? -Yes... What kind of man are you? Fool! - Did you light the candle? - I turned it on. - Is the tap open? - I'll open it right now. - Is the gun loaded? - I've loaded it before. Guys, I greet you ... ... and I wish you a good death. Expires calmly. ... to die there is always time. Salam. - We're at the end ... - Guys, an idea! If we blow out the candle, we will be saved. At three we all blow together. One two Three! Tough, huh! Stronger! One two Three! It would take three lungs! - Bravo! At last! - Fred! Got it, Robinot, huh? You could have taken your time. What rush was there? Thanks, Fred. Thanks to you, who risked your life to save my skin. I let you go, but what I really want is to tie you up!
