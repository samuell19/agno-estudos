--== McEphie ==-- Oh God! My son! My son! My son! Let's go. We'll be late for the shoot. But I'm still crying. Oh, leave that to Eddie's mom. She can outcry you anyway. -C'mon! -I don't want to go yet. C'mon! We can't be late for the shoot. Let's go! -Ma'am Ina. Where's our pay? -What? Go ask Eddie's mom. We're in a hurry. It's almost call time. Let's go! It's taking so long! Is it my turn? -Director? -Why is it taking so long? I'm really sorry, Ina, for making you wait so long. It's OK. What's happening, anyway? Where is she? Sir, she can't make it today. -I just talked to her. -She can't make it? The lead actress can't make it to the shoot today. OK, this is what we'll do instead. We'll have the dog run here and jump over there. Jump. Sir, the dog cannot jump. What? The dog cannot jump? Gosh! Oh, I know. Let's look for a stunt double for the dog then. But we don't have a stunt double for the dog. There's no double? We do, however, have a stunt double for Angel, our lead actress. Is that so? OK, just a sec. Ma'am Ina... I really thank you for helping me out here in my directorial debut. But of course, Bruno. Anything for you. Uh, can you be the stunt double for the dog? What? But Bruno, I'm the stunt double for the lead actress, not the dog. But it's easy, Ma'am Ina. All you have to do is run and jump over there. -What? Me, jump? -Yes! No way! I might die doing that stunt. You know I have lots of kids to take care of. But it's not that high. Just about five floors. -Five floors? No way! -C'mon. Come over here, Bestfriend. Don't pass up this chance. We're here anyway. Remember, you need the money for that surprise birthday party you're planning with your kids. But I'm the stunt double for the lead actress. There's no way I'm doing stunts for a dog. No way! Here I am, still surviving despite all the things that have happened to me and my children through the years. My eldest child, Juan, has joined his wife in New Zealand. They have good jobs over there. Because of my second child Tudis' love for the arts, she flew to Canada to marry a painter... a house painter, that is. My child Por, badly hurt by her breakup with boyfriend Jeffrey, joined GMA, Global Missionaries of Asia in India. My other child Sixto is now doing well as a nurse in London. He gets paid in pounds. And here are the rest of my children, who have loyally stayed with me: My hardworking child Tri is a call center supervisor at night. He studies Law during the day. My child Pip has not given up on his showbiz dreams. He shows up at all the auditions. -What's this? -A bag of rice. Isn't this the line for the PBB audition? It's PBB, all right. But a different kind. LINE FOR THE VILLAGE'S RICE Rice? My industrious child Seven helps me take care of the twins for now. Are you waiting for your ward as well? No, I'm not a nanny. I'm waiting for my sisters. Seven! My child Cate has strong political convictions. She fights for everything she believes in. The problem is, she's against a lot of things. My child Shammy is still in school. But he's more into making money than studying, which has been a huge headache for me. But who knows? He might turn out to be a businessman in the future. My child Tenten is the kindest and quietest of them all. I don't hear any complaints from him. My youngests, Connie and Sweet, are such precocious and naughty little ones. But that's just normal for kids their age. Connie, what happened to her? Sweet? -Gotcha! -Gotcha! I'm going to get you two. And, of course, if I'm the protagonist, there is always an antagonist. My best friend, Rowena. It feels so hot in here. -Oh, do you know what that's called? -What? You're going through menopause. Of course not. You're older than me. You'll go through menopause first. Excuse me, but I was born in 1964. You were born in 1962. And you look like you're 62. -I'll go and play Mahjong instead. -A game for an old lady like you. Since Rowena is not good with business, my diner went bankrupt. I had to close it down. Good morning, children! I'm so lucky with my children, for they don't give me any big problems. No one's a drug addict nor a pusher. They get into a little trouble from time to time but that's normal. C'mon, Bestfriend. You can do it. C'mon! Ouch! It hurts! Here they come. Here they come. There's lots of food! Is it our birthday today? No, we already turned seven. That's a six. -So, whose birthday is it? -I don't know. -Wow. -Oh, my God! It's Mom's birthday today. It's her 46th. -It's Mom's birthday. -Ma? I told you we were forgetting something today. -I'm sorry. -Sorry, Mom. I'm sorry, Mom. We thought you were at a shoot with Rowena. Not one of you remembered my birthday. I even prepared a surprise treat for everyone. I didn't think I'd be the one surprised. I'm no longer part of my children's daily lives... since I don't tend to their daily needs anymore. Perhaps I should do something to make me more important to them. Bestfriend Ina, what are you doing here? Hey, wait. Serves you right. The teacher's here. Hurry! What "ma'am"? I'm a student here, too. -What time is it, miss? -It's 10:30. 10:30? I'm late. If Superman can be two people and can change into his costume inside a phone booth, I can be both a working mother and a student myself. Miss, we'd like to order chicken barbecue. What's your order? Please hurry. It's so hot here. As much as I deny that I'm going through menopause, I can't deny my hot flushes. Goodness! I got fired from that job, so I tried looking for a cooler place to work. It's not my dream job, but at least I have my best friend, Rowena, to visit me. Look, we can apply for this new job. -We'll have a uniform, and we'll be... -Hey, Ina! Why are you not working? I bet all you do is cool your heels. Oh stop it, Bestfriend. The hell he cares about you. You're right. Let's go. Be careful. Ma'am, I'm a solo parent. I've done all sorts of jobs: a bus conductor, a construction worker, a pirated DVD vendor, a stuntwoman. I've never had that flexible work schedule you were talking about. If you can't report for work, you don't get paid. If you're a woman, they give you a hard time about becoming a construction worker. Is that what you call no work discrimination? You don't get parental leave even if you give birth twelve times. And there is no educational benefit for the kids. It is you who is inconsiderate. What right do you have to talk about benefits? Who do you think you are? God? That's good! She's great! She's really good! What am I talking about? I think you're arrogant. But please understand that we're talking about the law, not personal experiences. I forgive you. But I have a point, right? Mrs. Montecillo, when it comes to the law and my fellow men, I take things seriously. Seriously? Really? I'll think about it, ma'am. Mrs. Montecillo, I'm bothered by your twins' answers to their homework. -They tell me that you helped them do it. -That's right, ma'am. Take a look at this: What's the English word for uwak? -They wrote "eagle". -Is that wrong, ma'am? Mrs. Montecillo, it's "crow". "Eagle" is the English for agila. Ma'am, they both have wings. And once they're up there in the sky, you can no longer tell one from the other. Here's another, Mrs. Montecillo: -"What's the use of a palatial home..." -"... if you don't live there." That's wrong, Mrs. Montecillo. The saying goes: "What's the use of a palatial home if an owl lives there." I think you're the one who's wrong. First, why would you let an owl live in a palace? It's a bird, so it should live in a tree. And we don't live in a palace so we really don't care. So, you're wrong and I'm right. Mrs. Montecillo, I suggest you just get a private tutor for your kids. Or better yet, you go back to school yourself. I sent my kids here so you can teach them right. If you can't do that, I might as well pull them out of here. Besides, you charge very high tuition fees. I'm also good in those sayings: so we can have a big gang." You keep on scratching your head. Must be lice. Hey, why have you not changed your clothes? We're still doing our homework. What's this? You need to bring a parent to class for a talk? Yes. The parents are going to talk about their work. Let's ask mom when she gets home. Tri, what kind of talk would mom possibly give? By that time, she might be out of work again or fired. OK, I'll be the one to do it. Wow! Tri's coming to our class to give a talk. I'm sure our classmates will tell us we have a cool brother. That's for sure. Yehey! -See, your problem's solved. -Yay! Thank you, bro! Tri's going to do it. -Hey! Bestfriend! -Oh! What? You look troubled. It's about your kids again, huh? Do you know how I feel when after I've fended for them and taken care of them, still they're not content? Bestfriend, count your blessings. Most of your kids have good jobs. At least that's a huge load off your back. Because they're all hardworking. And I believe in the saying: "A hardworking child will grow up to be a tired adult." That's right, Bestfriend. You're also a woman who cannot be toppled by the test of time and trials. Bestfriend, I also believe in the saying: "A woman who cannot be toppled used to work as a bus conductor." -Really? -Yeah! Perhaps going back to school is not the solution to my problem. Perhaps I should get a decent job that would make my children really proud of me. Ina, are you ready? -Hurry up! -Who is it? -Ina... Pip! -Aunt Rowena! -Where's the PTA meeting? -PTA meeting? Usually in the classrooms. Hey, you're teasing me. This is my executive look. We have a big job interview in Malacañang. Which one? The mental asylum? No, that's a job fit for you. Where's your mom, anyway? -What? -Cook and take care of the twins, OK? -Let's go. Let's hurry! -Wow! Cool outfit, huh? We'll be late. The President is waiting for us. Of the Philippines? No, the President of the Megastar's Fan Club. -She's applying for a job, too. -Godmother, you really... -Take care of the twins, OK? -Yes. Mom. Have your photo taken with the President, OK? -We can make money out of that. -Sure. What job are you applying for in Malacañang, Mom? I'm not sure with your Aunt Rowena. It's a great job, for sure. Now stop pestering your mom or we'll be late for our interview and not be hired. It's going to be great, children. Sounds like a corporate executive position. And you believe Aunt Rowena here? It will be really fun! -We're going now. -Bye, Mom. -Pip, make dinner, OK? -Yes, Mom. Hurry! The limousine I rented will be here soon. -Really? You rented a limousine? -I did. I took care of it. Oh, here's the limousine now. Huh, is this a limousine? Hop on. Bestfriend, hurry up. There's a long queue. -Are you sure this is the queue? -Yes. -Are you really sure about this? -Of course. Housekeeping staff? What do you think a governess and a chambermaid do? Isn't the governess the assistant to the governor? Isn't the chambermaid the one who chooses the chandeliers here in Malacañang? What are you taking about? There is no such job description. You can leave if you want. Too bad. You're qualified for the job. -Oh, too bad. I thought... -We obviously misunderstood each other. -Madam! -Yeah, it's Madam! -Hey, you can't do that. -Please. -You can't get close to the President. -Wait! -We just want to shake her hand. -It's against protocol. -Come back some other time. -We just want to shake her hand. -Please come back some other time. -So strict. -That's right. -Those are the rules. -Just come back some other time. -We just want to take a peek. -We're really sorry. -Okay, we're leaving. -Oh! My God! -Ouch! -I'm sorry. Are you all right? -That hurt. -What are you doing here? -But it's OK. I'm here to see you. Bad timing. I'm making dinner. Then I have to pick up the twins from school. Then I have to look after my niece. Then I have to do the laundry. I can't go out on a date with you now. What? No, I'm not asking you out on a date. I'm here to give you something. Here you go. A sack of rice. Why? It's kind of corny if I give you flowers, right? And I heard your family is always short on rice. Who told you? Por...? Yeah. How can my children be proud of me? Are you going to tell your kids the truth about our job? Do you want me to lie to them? Would it be your first time to tell them a lie? -Why should I lie to them about it? -Why not? -I'll make you taste-- -Wait. Look there. -Is it rice? -No, it's a pillow. Of course it's rice. -Come on. Help me carry it? -Go on, taste it. Why don't you help me? What are you standing there for? Why is this sack so heavy? Ouch! My goodness! -It's so heavy. -Help me! Where are we bringing this? Hey... -What now, Jeffrey? -Ma! What is that man doing here, huh? -Ma! -What is he doing here? I'm here to court Seven, ma'am. You've got some nerve! It's bad enough that you broke Por's heart. Now, you're after Seven. What do you intend to do? Break all my daughters' hearts? So, who's next? Is it going to be me, huh? Hey, I still have Cate and Pip. -What makes you think you're next? -It's a long way to go for me. Get out of here! -I don't wanna see your face again. -Mom, let me explain. -I don't need any explanations. -I'm going now. I'm sorry. -Go now if you want. -This is ours. -Ma, Jeffrey brought it here. -No, ma'am. It's really mine. -It's ours. What are you doing? -No, it's mine. Jeffrey, give it to them, please. -Fine. You can have it. Sorry. -My hips! Bestfriend, it's the president. Let's have our photo taken with her. -I'm too embarrassed to ask. -Don't be. C'mon. I'm too embarrassed. I'm not dressed yet. Don't you want your ID photo with the President by your side? -I'd like that. -Then let's do it. We missed our chance. It's all your fault. It's Madam President! Faster! Hurry now! -I can't see her face. -Try another angle. I still can't see anything. All right, let's wait for her to wake up. Or should we wake her up? -My turn? -Yes! -The Madam! -Oh, there she is. She's awake! I was feeling chilly so I put on the President's blazer. What happened? What happened here? You look awfully tired. You better take a rest. Sure, Madam President. -It's Madam President! -It's Madam President! -Amy, did you see the President? -Yeah, she's here already. Let's go! Hurry! -Madam President! -What are you doing? You can't go here! Go to the kitchen! Get your camera. C'mon Hurry up. -Quick! -What's that? Give it to me! Now! -Wait. -Ouch! Bestfriend, are your hands tied up? -No. -What are you talking about? You've been told that you can't get close and jump on the President just like that. Jump on the President? We just took two steps. You're overreacting. We just wanted our photo taken with the President. Here's our camera. How many times do you have to be told you can't do that? This is your last warning, do you understand? Good evening, Madam President. Do you know where they keep the food around here? I'm hungry but I don't want to wake up the staff anymore. Let me prepare it for you, Madam President. Let me handle it. This is good. Thank you, Madam President. Tell me. What did you used to do before you worked here? Oh, Madam President, I've had lots of jobs, ranging from a construction worker to being a female impersonator in a bar. I've done all sorts of things. Why are you the breadwinner? Oh, the Almighty has taken my first three husbands. But I'm happy because they left me with a dozen kids. Most of them have finished school. The rest are good kids although they're mischievous at times. A dozen kids? Wow! You were able to raise them all by yourself? You are able to run a whole nation. How do you do it? You should be ready to serve your country in the same way you serve your family. Treat each person like your own child. You have to do everything to make things better for them. You're right, Madam President. But I can't imagine myself becoming President. -I think it's a really difficult job. -That's where you're wrong. You were able to raise a dozen kids all by yourself. millions of Filipinos. Madam President, I have always admired you, especially your fashion sense. -May I have my photo taken with you? -Oh, sure. Oh, sure! Oh, I don't have my camera with me. It's with Rowena. Why don't you use the camera on your mobile phone? Yeah, sure! Here we are. Oh, I'm sorry, Madam President... but my mobile phone does not have a camera on it. Next time then. I'll give you clothes of your choice as well. Oh thank you, Madam President. Just let me know... what's your name? It's Ina, Madam President. Oh thank you. I'll go now, Madam President. This bed feels so good, Bestfriend. Of course. What did you expect? The President said she'll give you shoes and clothes, right? -Yeah. -I don't think she really meant it. Don't say that, Rowena. Perhaps she's just too busy and that's why she forgot about it. Put this dress over there. Help me out and stop lying on that bed. -C'mon, I was just taking a break. -Break time's over. Help me clean up. Wow! What a beautiful dress. Hey, this dress suits you. It's Filipiniana. Try it on, quick! Why should I try on that kind of dress? Let's just wait for the President to hand it down to us. -Let's not mess with her stuff. -Look, you're just going to try it. I don't want to. -I said just try it on. -OK, I will. Ta-da! Oh, Bestfriend, you look gorgeous. You forced me to try it on. -So you really did feel like trying it on? -Yeah! I thought of teasing my hair up into a bouffant to fit the dress. -Oh, shoes to match. -Hurry! Try them on. -Try it now! -Wait a minute. You're beautiful. And respectable-looking, too. My goodness... -Oh no, Rowena. -Quick! Hide in that room. Hurry now, Rowena! My things! -Uh... the violet one? -Exactly. The Filipiniana dress? I don't know. -Is everything ready in the rally? -Yes, sir. I want a clean job, OK? Wait. Why, what's wrong? Yeah? Are you sure this call is not being traced back to me? -Sure. I'm a wise guy, like a serpent. -Good. I want to stand next to the President when our guy does it. Do you really need to stand next to the President? Yes. So I would look like a target as well. It's a cover up so I won't be a suspect. Are you sure there are no copies of the documents? Where are they? -They're on your desk, sir. -I have them. Where's the breakdown of the money? Relax, it is in your folder. Make sure you do a clean job, OK? -Yes. -I'll talk to you later. Madam! Goodness, Madam! What is it this time? -I need to tell the President something. -What? -What do you mean? -I need to give her a warning. -What? -I need to talk to her... I'm just saying goodbye. Police! My goodness! Bestfriend, you better take the President's dress off. -What's wrong? -The President... -What about her? -The President's going to be killed... -What did you say? -She's going to be assassinated... What are you saying? Who's going to assassinate the President? Vice President Bill... Here are the documents to prove it... -What are we going to do? -My God! -Let's go now, Rowena! -Oh my God, is this for real? We better go after her. Let's go ride... -with those policemen. Let's go. -Wait! -Rowena! -Let us ride, please! -Hop on. -Where are we going? Hurry now! Let's go! Countrymen, let's give a round of applause for the President of the Republic of the Philippines, her Excellency, Madam Hilary Daffalong! Thank you very much. This is the first time for this kind of gathering of Overseas Filipino Workers... so let me give you my heartfelt gratitude for your presence this morning. who are called the New Heroes of this generation. You are the reason why the Philippines has not gone into dire straits. Because of the dollar remittances you have infused into our economy. -Madam President, get off that stage! -Madam! What are we going to do now? Let's hurry now! -Hurry! Come on! -Let's write Madam President a note. Madam, get off the stage immediately. Please pass this note until it reaches Madam President. -What's this? -What is this for? -What are they doing? -I don't understand them! -How come the note got returned to us? -What's this? What are we going to do next? Wait. Watch me. -What are they doing? -Carry us to Madam President! -Let's bring them back! -Where are you carrying them? Get them back there! -Ah, where are we going? -Get them back there! -They're crazies! -Rowena! Oh, where are we? I'm dizzy. We're back where we started. Why did you bring us back here? -Madam! -Madam President, get off that stage! -Madam! -Security! Hurry! Get us an ambulance! Over there! He's going to have me killed. -Easy now, Mom. -Basilio... Crispin... my children... Mom, Basilio and Crispin are not your children. Mom, really? I'm going to die! I'm scared! It's me, your best friend! Bestfriend, -it's a good thing you recognized me. -You decided to be a nun? No, this is just a costume. I borrowed it from them. Bestfriend, we're not safe here anymore. We have to join them. -Are they wearing costumes as well? -No, they're real nuns. Really? Rowena, I don't want to go out there. -You need to act now. -I'm staying here. If you don't, who will? If not now, when? -Justice for Madam Hilary! -Justice! Don't be afraid. No one's going to hurt you. A lot of press people are already waiting for us. But you need to tell them everything. The truth will set you free. Feng Shui... I can't believe this... Feng Shui... Come here! I can no longer take the lies that Vice President Bill is telling people. So you better speak up now. Here with us is the controversial whistle blower, Ina Montecillo. -Good evening to you. -Good evening. Revelation time: What do you know about the President's assassination? It's like this... I heard and saw everything. And I can defend myself in all the courts. After all the horrible, dreadful, and disgusting things that the Vice President has done just to gain his position in government. He ordered the assassination of the President. And I have proof of this. Here are all the anomalous deals done by the Vice President. Here is the accounting of all the money he has squandered. All money of the people. Ina, do you have a message for the Vice President? I have one. Bill Bilyones, just remember this. We have a saying: "Everything you see, I see too." I will not allow ordinary Ina Montecillo to ruin my reputation. If she wants a fight, I will fight her with full confidence. I will not just assume the Presidency with such an allegation levied on me. So I'm challenging Ina Montecillo to a snap presidential election. Mom, it's no joke to run a country. The lives and futures of Filipinos are at stake here. It won't work. What does mom know about being a President, anyway? She'd be blamed for all of the country's problems. I'm not really sure but think about it. If we lived in Malacañang, we'd have free housing, food, water, gas-- everything. We surely could use that. Mom, how about former President Cory Aquino? She was a widow and a housewife. When she was President, the price of poor man's fish went down. That's a huge responsibility, Mom. -No, Mom, it's OK. -It could stress you out. -No, it's OK now. -What will you do if that happens? What? We live... a quiet life now. It's going to be chaotic... if and when. You're right about that. But... if you'll run the country... just like our family... we're going to be proud of you whatever you decide to do. -Mom! -Mama! -Mama! -Mom! -Mom? -What are we going to do? Ma. -Mom? -Mom, are you all right? -Mom! Shall we call for an ambulance? -Mom, are you OK? -Take it easy. -I'm all right. I'm running. I'm glad you decided to run with me. Well, I'm running now, aren't I? No, not that. I want you to run as my Vice President. Agree? Hi! Thank you! Vote for me! Explosives! -Wait! Do not fire! -Hurry! Stop firing! Thank you so much! Vote for me, OK? -OK. -Ina! He smells! Please vote for me. That's me. Fellow Filipinos. And the winner of the snap election is Ms. Ina Montecillo! -I, -I, -Ina Montecillo, -Ina Montecillo, promise to uphold my duties and responsibilities... -Just stay there! -Are you going to file an appeal? On his way now to his prison cell is former Vice President Bill Bilyones who was sentenced with life imprisonment by the Supreme Court. He ordered the assassination of former President Hilary Daffalong and is guilty of graft and corruption. -Have some snacks first. -OK, sir! -Thank you very much! -Thanks, Sir! Please take care of me. Leave it to me. I won't abandon you. That Ina must be ousted. Make the public clamor for it. Take care of it, OK? Once we leave this house, our lives will never be the same. You've waited a long time for a chance to make your kids be proud of you, right? -"Heal The World"? -Sounds like it. Bestfriend, what should I do with all this stuff? That's a lot of stuff. My goodness, this is beautiful! Looks good to me. -How much is this? -Yes, it fits you. See, Bestfriend, er... Madam Bestfriend. -My idea was brilliant, huh? -Yeah, it's fun! You don't need all this old stuff anymore. You're right. Did you know that famous designers have been calling me up? -Really? -They want me to wear their clothes. Please choose a wardrobe for me, OK? -Sure. You know I have good taste. -But that's my job. I'll be the one to decide, from your hairstyle to your shoes. -Really? -But of course. -Congratulations, Mom. -The table is so big! -What did you say? -Congratulations, Mom. What? Congratulations, Mom. I didn't hear you. Can you all move closer so we can hear each other better? You're all too far away. What's the matter, Mom? I just thought of your siblings who are not here. Juan, Tudis, Por, and Six. Mom, they have their own lives now. Let's not worry about them. Let's worry about us. Our situation is different now. All eyes are on us now. It's worse than living in Big Brother's house. Everyone will try to criticize us, especially me. But I'm not worried for me but for you all. I don't want people talking ill of you. So let's try to stay away from trouble and scandal. Mom, we should pay attention to the biggest problem of the Philippines. -Which is what? -The network wars. I should do guestings at both ABS-CBN and GMA. That would be great, huh? You need to choose your cabinet. Mom, I'm not joking with you. Choosing your cabinet is a serious matter. But I'm serious. Here's the cabinet. What's that? With the cabinet members. Mom, is that one still alive? Oh, yes, he's still alive. These are our neighbors and my childhood friends. I want to give a solution to education because this is the number one problem in our country. There are many problems with education. First, we lack teachers. We lack classrooms. But we have lots of students. What is the solution to this? Let's fast-track the construction of school buildings. By doing so, we'll increase the number of classrooms. And let's place casinos near the schools so that teachers can go there for recreational purposes. Hmm... We can do that. It will take a long time if we wait for the new classrooms. And, Madam, we don't have the budget for it. Based on my experience with a kid's show, it's hard to put kids to sleep at night since they want to watch more TV. We can have them go to school at night instead. If we have morning and afternoon classes now, why not night and midnight classes? -What are you saying? -Wait. I have a suggestion. Why don't we give the same salary to teachers that we do call center agents? Yes, great idea. Then let's make those call center agents high school teachers so kids can have an American twang early on. Yes, let's try that. Yes, that's right. What? What is his post? Oh, my twins are so studious. Why are you still wearing your school uniforms? Go change so you can have dinner and then go to bed. How can they go to bed when they're off to school? At this hour? What kind of school is that? Why are classes at night? Is that really a school or a call center? Why did you allow the twins to take night classes? -Mom. -What... As per your decree, the twins have to take night classes. They were made to set an example. Can we not request that...? If we do that, they'd say that the twins are being given special treatment. They'd be hard on the twins. Mom, the next time you make a decree that you're not sure about, ask someone who's familiar with the law. I'm the one studying to be lawyer in this family. -What? What are you doing? -Rowena. You startled me. What's the matter? Why do you have dark circles around your eyes? I've been staying up all night trying to answer all your hate mail and death threats. And I've been chatting online with this guy from Uzbekistan. -Where's that? -In Europe. -Where in Europe? -Somewhere out there, in the city proper. You're pulling my leg again. My fears have come true. I'm not sure what I've gotten myself into. You give up too easily. Let the people be the judge of that. They'll protest if they don't like you. I really don't know what to do. There's no tutorial or crash course for being a President. Then follow your maternal instincts, for they're always right. Don't you want your kids to be proud of you? They're proud that you're the President of the Philippines. Rowena, I'm not the President. -You are the President. -I'm not the President. You're the President. What are you saying? You are the President. If I were the President, I'd be the one sitting there. -Oh, right. Come over and sit here then. -Of course it is. -Why were you seated over there, anyway? -Because you were sitting on my seat. There you go, Madam President. Take a look at this. Where is that Uzbekistan? There in Europe. Near the grade school. Grade school? There, he's online. Are they public school students or zombies in the making? What else is going to happen to the country under this administration? Mr. Senator, what can you say about the decrees passed by Madam President Ina? She knows nothing so she's experimenting on us. Madam Bestfriend, explain your situation to your kids so they can understand. Madam Bestfriend, your kids are here. Talk to them now. There's Tri. Talk to him. Tri, I'd like to explain about... There are your two daughters. Talk to them. Cate, Seven, I'd like to tell you some... There's Shammy and your gay son. There's Tenten. Talk to him... I mean, using sign language. We need to talk. Wait... -We're going to bed, Mom. -I just need to tell you about... Huh? No sound? Tenten, I'm just maximizing our celebrity status now, OK? It's going to be over soon anyway. -How you doin', bro? -Shammy! What's up? -How's life in Malacañang, bro? -It's cool. -How about buying us drinks sometime? -Sure. Come over anytime. How's life there? Good? -Of course. I live like a king now. -We envy you. You're cool. Just look at me. Shammy, we just came from ballet rehearsal. -Can we go home with Tenten now? -Go ahead. Bring this with you. -I just need to talk with my buddies here. -We have a business proposal for you. What kind of business? College TV-Horse Race Betting Enterprise. Is that legal? If your mom signs the permit, it's legal. Your name will not appear on the corporate documents. -Yeah, trust us! -My mom might get into trouble. -We'll take care of you. This is safe. -It's safe. OK. Thank you for coming to this emergency press conference. I would like to apologize for my recent decisions... and solutions which brought even more problems to the country. It was all my fault. We have a saying: "Nobody's perfect". Since I was a nobody then, then I guess I'm not perfect. Seriously, I am repealing the Presidential Decree I made as the answer to the problem of education. As a mother, I know how important it is to have our children finish school. I will build more schools that do not look like evacuation centers. And to improve the quality of education, I will prevent our good teachers from leaving the country by increasing their salaries. From now on, teachers will have the same salary as call center agents. Because I believe in the saying that: "A person in financial need would borrow money from an Indian usurer." Let me give you a reminder: Life is like a rock. It's hard. So we need to fight. Thank you very much. Your approval rating went up. What's the matter, Bestfriend? Rowena, I need to pee. -What? -Why aren't we moving? The traffic is really bad. Our police escorts can't do anything. Let's try and go that way. My bladder is about to explode. -Move over. -Where are you going, ma'am? -Come back inside the car, ma'am. -I'll just pee here. Ma'am, wait a minute! It's dangerous! Traffic has been our perennial problem. One cause of this is the lack of discipline among motorists. Because of traffic, work and deliveries are delayed, and gas is wasted. People are late for their appointments. And worst of all, people get bladder problems when they hold their pee. Therefore, from hereon... those who do not follow traffic rules will go straight to jail. Here along EDSA, stinking portable toilets have been designated... to hold traffic rule violators and those who don't flush the toilet after use. Is this the answer to the worsening traffic problem, or is this just another trick from the Hitler-like President? -Rowena goes missing when I need her most. -Mom? Wait. Stop. I've already made a decision. Can you give me a chance to make it work first? Can you? What are you doing here? I don't think they need me inside. You know, Tri, I really admire you. You're young yet brilliant. Now, if they can't see your capabilities, your true value... you should go where you'll be appreciated. Madam Bestfriend, the weather bureau reports -an incoming storm. -That's nothing. You're so hardworking despite the weather. We've gone to San Pedro in Laguna, to Antipolo, and now to Cogeo. What are we looking for, anyway? -I'm looking for something? -What is it? This! This is the perfect spot for my project. We have a shortage of rice, right? Then let's plant in all the idle lands. -Plant what? -Rice. What? But, Madam Bestfriend, where will we get the equipment for the rice planting? The rice seedlings? The fertilizer? I know. We will give rice to the poor. But we will give rice seedlings to the rich. If they don't plant the seedlings, then they'll go hungry. That's right. We have a saying: "I planted the rice but someone else ate it -because I'm on a no-carb diet." -Huh? We'll pull out the rice seedlings. Then all we have to know is to count. Let's go. Because of the rice shortage we are facing... also known as the Planting-Rice-ls-Never-Fun Act. Madam Bestfriend, let's eat. The President is really hardworking. My back is killing me. Planting rice is really never fun. From now on, no one can order an extra helping of cooked rice if he cannot finish it. And if someone is found to be wasting rice, he shall be brought to the Banaue Rice Terraces to plant rice there. All idle lands shall be planted with rice and vegetables. If not, they shall be converted to residential communities. All problems have solutions, right? If there is no solution, then don't treat it as a problem. We have this saying: "If there's no smoke, no one is cooking." That's correct. It's for certain. There you go. There! There should be no rice shortage now. What happened to you? How come you haven't finished yet? Why are you not finished yet? I'm so tired already. This is the 15th van I've loaded with water. Your security escorts have done nothing to help me. Why don't you help Rowena over here? But Ma'am, we've finished loading ten trucks already. We've sent them to the airport. Look Bestfriend, they've already done ten trucks... but you've only managed to load 15 vans. Why are we doing this, anyway? We're going to the Middle East tomorrow, right? And so? I'll tell you my plan once we get there. Bestfriend, just make sure your plan succeeds. Or else people would say you just went to the Middle East on a junket. -You even dragged me along. -Bestfriend, my plan is sure to succeed. I told the press that if it doesn't succeed, -I'll have you buried in the desert. -What? Why me? Why do I have to be buried? -But I've already told them. -I don't want to be buried! -Do your best. -I'll try. Why only try? Do it. Do your best. -Uh... Bestfriend... -What are you saying? -Let's go. -There. Let's go. Why is he speaking in Tagalog? If they don't want to do business with us, then we don't. But we have to bring back oil to the Philippines. Then let's buy oil. Do you have the budget, huh? But oil prices have gone down. It's down now. But how about next year, not this year? It might double. That's why I'm doing this. Because the only cheap oil around is the oil on your face. Really? No wonder one of the Arab guys kept smiling at me. He probably thought I'm a natural oil producer. Stop joking around. They say we didn't bring enough water? Let's see. What do you plan to do? -Bestfriend, what are you going to do? -Wait here. God of rain, let it rain please. What's happening here? -You want many rain? -You're great, Bestfriend. -This is awesome. -This is good! -Who are you? -I'm Jeffrey Sta. Maria, sir. This is just standard inspection. Check this. Put your hands up. What's this? Take off your clothes. Jeffrey, what happened to you? -What did you do to him? -I'm sorry, ma'am. -He's visiting me. Please leave us. -Excuse me, ma'am. I'm really sorry. They're pretty strict here, huh? If this happens to me again, you're eloping with me. -Mom? -Do you have medicine for a headache? I'll get some. Sit down here first. -Mom, are you all right? -Huh? -Wait here, Mom. I'll get you medicine. -I'm all right. It's just a headache. Mom, you're running a fever. You'll be able to rest here. Is this the headache medicine? -Uh-uh. -Yes, Mom. Do you want to spend the night with us? -Yes, Mom. -You're alone in your room. Uh-uh. OK. Cate, better call Pip to help us out. -I feel cold. -OK. Mom, better lie down here first. -I feel cold, Seven. -Wait here, Mom. There you go. I'll just get some ice from downstairs. I'll be right back. Seven? This is our chance to elope. I'm sure your mom won't approve but I can't wait to be with you anymore. Seven, do you want to elope with me? Somebody might catch me here. What? What's this? Are you sleepy? Oh, you're sleepy. Do you want me to carry you? OK. Ouch! Seven, you've gained weight. Watch your step. I'm sorry. -Seven? -What are you doing? What? So who's this? The President. -Hey you! -Please, ma'am. That's enough. -Ma'am! -Let go of him! -Get away from her! -Seven! -Get away from him! -Mom? Have you no regard for your sister? Por left because that man broke her heart. -Mom, wake up! -Wait! Get away from me! Wait! Go away! -Let's give her some room. -Hey you, get out of here! I love Jeffrey. We love each other. I've talked to Por already, ma'am. She has forgiven me. What you did to Por is unforgivable. Escorts, get that guy! Mom, please don't! Mom, I'm begging you. -Wait! Get away from me! -Bestfriend, what's wrong with you? Hey you, we have a saying: "The pain on the small finger... is really painful." -Mom. -Ma! -Bestfriend! -Don't touch me! -Let's not touch her. -What medicine did you give me? I feel so dizzy. Mom, you said you have a headache. So I gave you a sleeping pill. You were trying to drug me so you can run away with this guy. -Mom, I could never do that to you. -Hey, get that man out of here! Seven, you stay in this room. The rest of you, leave. Go now to your rooms! -Hurry! -Hey! Mom! You've done this twice already. Don't do it a third time, OK? Mom, I'm sorry. I have no intention of eloping with Jeffrey. -Mom, let's talk about this please. -Go ahead. Talk. Look, Mom... Mom, wake up. Aunt Rowena, help! I'll run towards him and punch him, right? -Yes. -OK. Yeah. I'll just get something from my car. Sure, go ahead. Ouch. It hurts! -Pip, bro. -Huh? -What's up, dude? -Pip, were you crying? Of course not. Why would I be crying? -Oh don't do that, dude. -I'm sorry, bro. Are you gay or something? I'm sorry, bro. You made a mistake in the fight routine so my punch landed on you. I said I'm all right. Bro, I'm sorry I hurt you. I didn't mean it. It's OK. Can I take a look? -Does it hurt? -Yeah. -You were hurt pretty bad. -Pretty much. Are you OK? I'm OK. -Come in. -Mom. Mom, may I have a word with you? I need you to sign a contract since I'm putting up a business in school. Will you let me? It's OK to be an entrepreneur as long as your business is legal, OK? It's legal, Mom. See? Please sign here. -Hurry, so I can go to school. -Hello. Rowena? Yeah? -That should do it, Mom. -Please fix my schedule... -for today and tomorrow. -I'll go ahead. Thank you. OK? -Mom... -Wait. I'll go first. -But I was here first. -Mom... I feel so sleepy. What is it? Mom, well... Really? With whom? With that actor I'm doing a movie with right now. He's so handsome. Mom, I'd just like to ask you. Can you pass a law that would, you know... allow gay marriages? What? Pip, we would both go to jail if I did that. -But, Mom... -My advice to you is this. Whatever makes you happy. Just be discreet about it, OK? -OK, Mom. Goodnight. Thank you. -OK. OK, it's your turn now. -I'm older so I should be next. -Can I go next? -How come Shammy got to go first? -Mom. Mom, what I'm going to say is... Oh, she's asleep now. Stop that. Remember... -Surprise! -Of course! Mr. Montecillo will now be our adviser. He will take us straight to the Senate. Rowena, this video piracy has really gone rampant. -I was just looking around, sir. -Let's go now! I told you, thieves and pirates are siblings. And stubborn people are their cousins. -What? -Hey wait. -It's Pip. -It's Pip. His movie is now on DVD. -But you know... -It's now on DVD? Don't fret. That's how fast pirating is. Really advanced. But how come he did not invite you to his movie's premiere night? It's not that. I mean how come the movie is now on DVD when it's not even finished yet? That's how advanced these video pirates are. -That's right, ma'am. -Put it on the DVD player. Oh, there! -Oh, it's Pip. My son! -Oh, it's Pip. He's so good-looking. -Oh my, look. -What are they doing now? Why are they hugging? They were just fighting, and now they are kissing? Bestfriend, don't worry. It's just a pirated DVD copy. Perhaps the original version is different. And perhaps they had Pip's face replaced as well. -No? -No. You wait for Mom to be President before you do all this? -What the hell were you thinking? -What's wrong with you? Answer me! Mom! -Answer me! -I did nothing wrong. Nothing? What do you call this? I wasn't thinking of anything. If I were, I would have noticed they were taking a video of me. You know what? You gay people are really... Really what? Go ahead. Say it. Salot! I said salot not slut, stupid. -You're a salot! -How dare you? -Pip! Tri! -You're the worst! -You thought I wouldn't fight you? -Tri! -Pip! -Stop it! Stop fighting! Stop now! Why do you two keep fighting? Is it hard to be civil to one another for my sake? He's the one who pretends to be faultless. -Don't start with me again. -Stop it! Your brother is angry at you... because he's trying to protect my and all your reputations. That's what you think. He's not concerned about your approval rating. He's more concerned about his. Because he has made new friends in the opposition party. Is this true, Tri? Mom... Mom... I'll talk to you later. Mom... if only I could hide this from you forever... but I can't do that. What is it? Here it is... You're being expelled from school? What did you do this time? You want me to talk to your school principal? What's this about, Shammy? You don't have to do that, Mom. It's actually my fault. Why? What did you do? I set up an off-site horse race betting station in school. How can that be? I have to sign a permit before... Is this... Is this what you had me sign last time? Is this...? You took advantage of my fatigue, Shammy. -You have no shame. -I'm sorry, Mom. "I'm sorry"? I have lots of problems now. And I'm really so tired. You tricked me. You betrayed my trust. Mom... I'm sorry, Mom. -Mom... I'm sorry, Mom. -I didn't raise you to be like that. Where did I go wrong, Rowena? What should I do? What have I not done yet? I'm just so tired. I'm just so tired. That's enough, Bestfriend. Let me bring you to your room. Take a rest. Wait, let me turn off the lights. I'll do it. In short, what the hell is wrong with you people? Did you have difficulty growing up? Did you have a traumatic childhood? Tri, why did you join the opposition party? that you keep on opposing it? And Seven, did you really need to share a piece of that tiny man with your sister Por? And Pip, why did you have to do your stuff in a movie house? -Rowena... -And you, Ina... Your turn. What's happening to you, my children? Don't pretend as if you know nothing. We're your children. Before you look after the whole country, you have to look after us first. You told me... But why is it that... no one understands me now? I'm treated worse than a leper. I've done everything you told me to. All of us here. I'm always by your side. But I felt you always treated me not as your child... but like your maid. Only one person can make me happy. Why can't you see that... things can work out between Jeffrey and me, unlike what happened with Por? We all feel the same way, Mom. The country has a decent mother... but we don't. Should we join them in their group hug? We better not. Mom is hugging too many already. -And she's tired. -I feel sorry for mom. We are a burden to her. You're right. I have an idea so we won't be a burden to her anymore. Let's go pack our clothes. OK. It's a good thing we got past the guards. Have we gone far from Malacañang? I think so. My shoes are all worn out. Look. Kids, how about some crispy pork cracklings? How much are they? Twenty-five pesos per pack. Wait, you look like the President's twin daughters. No, we're not them. -I think you are. -No, we're not. So what are you doing here? Are you with the President? -No. We ran away from home. -What? You're stowaways? Poor kids. I better take you to the police precinct then. C'mon, let's go. Hold on to my skirt. -Hold on to it no matter what. -Yes, ma'am. Mister policeman... The President's twin daughters have been kidnapped! Were you raped, ma'am? No, I wasn't. The President's twin daughters were holding on to my skirt. -What? The President's daughters? -They were kidnapped. What did they tell you over the phone? -They told me the twins were kidnapped. -How did that happen? How did they leave the palace without anyone noticing? Come on. -Excuse me. -It's Madam President. Who's the witness to my daughters' kidnapping? Madam, it's this old lady. What happened, ma'am? I didn't notice that we were being stalked by kidnappers, ma'am. -What? -I wanted to... -I wanted to rescue them, but... -How many kidnappers were there, ma'am? I didn't notice, ma'am. Let's just watch the news coverage on TV. The terrorists now... That's enough. You've said too much. Listen. The lives of the President's two daughters are in our hands. In exchange for their lives... we want four members of our movement to be released from prison. If they're not released, we'll release these kids... to heaven! Madam, what would you like to do next? I don't know. I'm confused. Madam, the press are waiting. They want to know your stand on your kids' ransom. I'm confused. The kidnappers want you to release terrorists from prison. Huh? -I'm so confused. -Bestfriend... why don't we throw tear gas at them? Or blow up their hideout? Fool! What if I blow you up? It should have been you who was kidnapped. -Why me? -But why my twins? -But why me? -You're inefficient! Why me? It's these guys' fault. And yours. -And yours. -Rowena! You thought I wouldn't see you. Let's go now! Stop that! You guys! -Rowena! -Here she goes again! Fellow men, we called for this meeting because... as we all know, our dear President has a serious problem. As her spokesperson, I'm now asking for your help. Should the terrorists be released in exchange for the release of the twins? If the terrorists are released, the twins will be spared. If they are not released, the twins will be killed. So, you decide. I know it's going to be difficult. -So please text your votes, OK? -Text vote? Text "Yes" or "No", space, then "Set Them Free", to 1234. Did you get that? -Yeah! -We're doing it now! Let's also pray for the rescue of the President's daughters. Bestfriend, come let's eat. I don't feel like eating, Rowena. In a situation like this, I don't think I can swallow any food. Madam, we have the result of the national text voting. -What is it? -Come here. What was the result? The nation texted "No". Oh no, you can't tell the President that. Remember those kids are her baby daughters. With all the trials she has gone through in life, she can't find out the result. My God, she can't find out. Let me be the one to tell her. -Bestfriend... -The nation texted "No". How did you find out? Your loud voice, Rowena, I heard everything you said. Madam, do you want me to talk to the terrorists? They will not listen to reason. Yes, because they have no souls. Their fathers are followers of Satan. And their mothers... what are their mothers, anyway? My apologies for this emergency press conference once more. This is regarding the result of the national text voting. I can't blame you... for putting the nation's safety above that of my daughters'. But my daughters' lives... are in danger. If I don't release the terrorists... I'm not even sure what will happen to all of us... or if my daughters would even be safe. Please forgive me. I'm a mother. My daughters are still too young. They have their whole lives ahead of them. I wish I was the one taken instead of them. At this point, I'm appealing... not to the terrorists, but to their mothers. I know they'll understand... how I feel right now. Please talk to your children... who took my daughters. I beg you on bended knee. A mother talking to another mother. An appeal to your mother's heart. Please talk to your children. I beg you. Please tell them not to hurt my twin daughters. This incident is nothing short of a miracle. After the President appealed to the mothers of the terrorists, the mothers rushed to the terrorists' hideout and foiled the terrorists' kidnapping. The President's whole family is here including the rescued twin daughters. Madam President. We are the mothers of these rebels. -Yeah, Madam. -Please forgive my baby boy. He's still too young. He just got dragged along. Thank you all for your understanding. Go ahead. Take them away. -Were you hurt by them? -Not really. I would never have forgiven myself if something bad had happened to you. I missed you. -I should be the one saying sorry to you. -No, Mom. We were the ones who forgot. We forgot to understand you. Mom, you're the most important person to us. The truth is, I really don't care about good-looking guys anymore. After all, we have a saying: "Not all good-looking men have girlfriends. Sometimes, they have boyfriends too." You're right, Mom. So from now on, I won't look at another good-looking guy. Look Pip, that policeman is gorgeous. Really? Where? -Ouch. -Serves you right. Stop that, Pip. Mom, we are all very proud of you. There. Mom, are you ready for your speech? Of course. This is the most important speech I'd be making. Let's go now. In the last ten months, the Philippines has gone through a lot of crises. And we are fortunate to have overcome all of them. A lot of people were glad... a lot of lives were improved... and a lot of families were changed. There are those who tell me that I brought our country back to its feet. But I failed to take care of one thing. My own family. And for that, I ask for my children's forgiveness. I accepted the Presidency not because I wanted to, but because I wanted my children... to be proud of me. I wanted them to be able to tell the whole country proudly... that I'm their mother. After all that has happened to us... I realized that the Philippines can have anyone as mother of the nation. But my children can only have me as their mother. They only have me to lean on. I cannot turn my back on them. And because of that... I, Ina Montecillo... am resigning as President of the Republic of the Philippines. But why? I am turning over the administration of the whole Philippines... to our Vice President, Ren Constantino. I believe in her capabilities... and I know she'll make a good President of our country. Because I believe in the saying: "It's better to resign early than wait for darkness to come... because they say it's bad luck." Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity... to be the mother of all of you. Good day to you all. Leave them. Thank you, ma'am. I'm 47 today. Kids! My goodness. I'm pretty sure you have some surprises for me. I can tell. Kids! Huh? Did they forget my birthday again? Mom! My goodness. You too? Oh, I thought you all forgot my birthday again. That only happened once. It will never happen again. Now, we'll celebrate your fabulous birthday. Awesome! -Oh thank you, my children. -Happy birthday, ma'am. -Great party, huh? -Wow, there's lots of food. We prepared all your favorites, Mom. Mom, I made baked mussels. You always cook for us on our birthdays. Now it's our turn to cook for you. -How sweet of you, my children. -Wishing you long life, I made fabulous spaghetti. That fabulous, huh? Thank you so much, kids. I really thought you'd forgotten my birthday. -Mom! -Oh? Kids, why do you have so little cheese on your spaghetti? Let's put some more to make it more delicious. Thank you so much to all of you. Those wings, when you see them in the air... What now? If I have a say in it, I'm going to stop her from going here. I forgot my line! Your choice. You won't have money to spend for the birthday party... Can I do this? -Is he still alive? -Yeah, he's still alive. You're over-acting. We only want a picture. -I'm getting a headache. -Just do your best! -Yeah, I'll try. -Cut. Do your best. Do your best. We have a saying: "If there's a smoke, there's..." I called this conference because I'd like a peaceful resolution. We have to come to a settlement... Seven? Then who's this? Because I believe in the saying: "It's better to give up early... than to stay till night." Because... OK, now. Because I believe in the saying: "It's better to be..." "It's better to give up early than stay till night." And every empty lot... And every empty land... What business is this? It's an eatery. Is it not obvious? An eatery? Why is no one eating here? Maybe the food is bad. Crazy! There they are. Education is what I want us to solve. Sorry! Tri, slow down! I'm in heels! It's difficult. Hey, Tri! -Cut! -Why don't you dance?
