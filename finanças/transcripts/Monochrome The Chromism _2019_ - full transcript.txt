(gentle music) (dramatic music) (gentle music) - [Isaac] I was the first. Often I try to remember what life was like before the hues, before the war, before the violence, before the world went crazy. Life was much simpler then. The meaning, the purpose, the light, all were equal. Society has labeled me an outcast, a freak, a hue, but we tend to fear what we do not understand. I am no different now than I was back then, but they see me in a different light, because I am light, I am hue, but how much less of a man am I for it? Yes, I was the first, I will not be the last. (tense music) - [Man] A.m. check in, check in, Isaac. Check in, Isaac. - I'm here, doc. I'm still here. - [Man] Good to know you're still with me, Isaac. Same time tonight for p.m. check in. Stay safe. You're getting close. - Okay. I'll see you soon, doc. (bell ringing) - What can I get ya? - Water. - Ceasefire negotiations between England and the US are expected to continue late into next week. This ironically will mark the one year anniversary since the first hue outbreak occurred. Officials say with the hue population still growing rapidly, we can expect it to double the non-affected population by the end of this year. Please remember, bounty rewards for the capture or information leading to the capture of any hue is still in effect. Please report all hue activity to your local authorities. - Where are you headed, friend? (tense music) I said, where you headed? - West. Headed west. - Headed west, huh? - Thank you. (glass clinking) - Do you know what the problem with this world is, friend? Too many of those damn hues running around, messing with the balance of the world. Those crazy, glowing, mutated freaks! (laughs) Oh I would say I've had, I'd say, two or three of them, these past few months. I hear that's pretty good for just passing through these parts. So what about you, friend? How many have you bagged? Hey, I'm talkin' to you! Show some damn respect. It's a hue! It's a hue! (whacking) - Get him! - Come here, buddy. Come here, buddy. Get back here! (whacking) - I got him! Carl, you call the marshal, and you tell him we got a few more hues for them to pick up. (alarm beeping) - [Reporter] Good morning Dallas. It's just after 8 o'clock on what is looking to be another triple digit Monday. As you'd expect, traffic is already piling up along the interstate, so if you're going through the checkpoint to get into downtown this morning, make sure to leave a little early. According to officials, the orange terror threat level still remains in effect today, and for the rest of the week. As always, avoid those crowded locations if possible, and stay aware of your surroundings. That's all for me, I'll turn it over to Neil with the sports highlights from last night. - The presentation got moved to tomorrow, so I'll have to stay late again tonight. - All right, so? - So, we'll have to cancel our dinner again. - That's okay, I mean I know how important this could be for you, so. - No, I know, I just didn't want to have to cancel again. - How about I come over after, and we order in? Chinese? - You know I'm always down for some Chinese, and to see you, of course. (laughs) Oh great, my checkpoint's backed up again. - Bad? - It could be worse. You know they should really just take these checkpoints down, it's been what, six weeks and nothing's happened yet. - [Victoria] They're probably just being cautious. - Yeah that, or they know something that we don't, or won't tell us. All right, I'm up. I'll talk to you tonight. - Yeah, see you tonight. I love you. - Love you too. - Okay, bye. - Where you headed? - Going to work. - Are you currently in possession of any fire arms or explosives? - No. - Illegal substances? - No. - And how long will you remain in downtown, zone four today? - Eight hours. - All right... - Actually, sorry, I'm gonna need about 10 hours today. - 10? - Yeah, I'm surprising my girlfriend with dinner reservations downtown at this nice restaurant. I'm gonna propose. - Oh, I see. All right, Mr. Ward, have a good day, and good luck. - Thank you. (siren wailing) (tense music) - Ready. Quickly, quickly. Hurry, hurry, hurry, quickly, quickly. Come on, come on. Thank you. Careful, careful. Okay. Good, good. Hold steady, hold steady. - It's time. - We're good. All right, hold on a moment please. Come on, come on. Almost done. Ready. - He's expecting you. (tense music) - Nervous? - Dude. (laughs) I don't think I've ever been this nervous about anything. - Ready though? You're leaving kind of early, aren't you? - I just gotta get there and make sure everything's set up. It has to be perfect. - Hey, it's gonna be fine. Dude, you've been planning this thing for months. She's gonna love it. - But what if she doesn't, man? What if we get there, the whole place is full, I can't find a spot, the food is bad... - Hey. It's gonna be fine. Now get the hell outta here, and I'll have her get there around 6:30. - You still comin'? - Yeah, I wouldn't miss it for the world, little brother. - Thanks Jerry. (Jerry laughing gently) (slapping) See you at six. - Six. Oh hey, Isaac, don't forget the ring. - Ha ha, very funny, Jerry. (tense music) - Ah, just the man I wanted to see. Have a seat, professor. Well, what do you got for me? - I have the initial doses right here. - Ready to proceed as planned? - Yes sir, all of the other sites have confirmed of seed of the virus. - Let me see it. (tense music) Yes, yes. You might wanna leave town, professor. Things are about to get a little bit crazy. - Here you go, sir, best in the house. - This is perfect. Thanks again for helping me get everything set up. - It's our pleasure. Will there be anything else? - No, I think that's just about it. You made it. - They got something going on out there. They got security patrol, checking vehicles. I don't know. Man, you ready? She gonna be here any minute. - Almost good to go. - [Jerry] Okay. (phone beeping) - It's mom. Hi mom. Yeah, I'm good. I don't know what's going on. Yeah, Jerry was saying the same thing. Yes, mom, I am extremely nervous. The ring, man, I must have left it in the car. Give her one ready to go, I'll be right back. - I told you, man. - Shut it, Jerry. No mom, everything's fine, just gonna make sure the ring is in the car. Yeah no, we'll be okay, it's all set up. Would you please let me stress about this? (siren wailing) All right. It's starting to rain. Yeah, I'll call you and dad tomorrow, let you know how it goes. All right, I love you too. All right, bye. (gunshots firing) - Oh my gosh, oh no. What happened? Are you okay? - I'm calling 911. - What happened? - Isaac! - I'm calling 911. - Move, move, get out the way. Move, move, move. - I'm calling an ambulance. - What happened? Hey, hey. What happened? - I don't know, I've never seen it before. - [Woman] He was shot. - Isaac? - Victoria, wait! - Isaac! - Come here. Come here, come here, come here. It's not safe here, come here. - Everyone get back, get back! Get back, get back. Everyone. Sir? It's gonna be okay. Can you hear me? Ambulance is on its way. (tense music) It's gonna be okay. (heavy breathing) (siren wailing) Ambulance is on its way. Its gonna be okay, sir. (siren wailing) - Isaac, can you hear me? Please! Say something. What is wrong with him? What is wrong with his blood? Why does it look like that? - He's been shot, we're trying to stabilize him. I need you to put these on and get back. Don't touch anything, do you understand? Don't touch anything. (siren wailing) - All right, what have we got? - Adult male, gunshot wound to the chest. He has hypotensive, blood pressure's 70 over 50. - Looks like the bullet just missed his lung. - He's lost a lot of blood. We hung two units on the drive over. - His blood is. - This the GSW from downtown? Good God, what is that? - We don't know. - He was the only one like this at the scene. - I've never seen anything like it before in my life, this might be more than a gunshot wound. Go, take him to C wing, move all other patients to A. No one enters or exits that wing, do I make myself clear? - Yes sir. - Begin emergency management protocol, quarantine anywhere that this man has been. All of you and any of you have come in contact with him stays as well, and find me that first responder. Fully suit up, stay put. I'm contacting the authorities. We need to know exactly what we're dealing with here. - Shh, here it is. Here it is. - we interrupt your regular scheduled programming to bring you some breaking news tonight. Authorities have issued an immediate lockdown of downtown. All checkpoints have been closed, and they're warning everyone inside to stay where they are. An attack downtown this afternoon may be linked to one of the warned about bio-warfare attacks. Homeland security and the CDC are on the scene, and have quarantined a good portion of the downtown area. Reporter Trish Deharo is on the scene with the latest. - Thanks Julie. The authorities have blocked off most of the access to the scene of the initial incident, and they're here tonight in full force, wearing their biohazard suits. What I can tell you is that the cause for concern arose when the victim of the shooting's blood was reported to be glowing unusually. We have unconfirmed reports that the suspects are in custody, and the victim is being treated at a nearby hospital. We have. Shh, they're coming. - We seem to be having some connection issues with the field, but we will keep you informed throughout the night. - What do you think's gonna happen? - I can't be certain. That's nothing anyone's ever seen before. - Again, as a precaution, authorities are asking everyone to stay away from downtown, and if you happen to be within the quarantine zone, please stay where you are. If you see anything suspicious, please report it to your local authorities. - Glowing? Do you mind telling me just what the hell's going on? - [Man] I don't know sir, I've never seen this before. - With phase one in motion, we can't afford to have any unnecessary attention to the company. There's too much at stake, understand? - [Man] Yes sir. - Now tell me, is this our virus? - [Man] No sir. - You're absolutely positively sure? - I mean I can't be 100% sure, but I'd need to run more tests. - Right then, road trip. You see, I need you to be absolutely positively clear as crystal sure, understand? - Yes sir. - All right. Secure some time with this glowing patient at the hospital, and run your test there quietly. Oh, shotgun. Sorry professor, you can ride in the back with Az. - Great. (tense music) - Isaac! (Isaac panting) - What is this, what's happening to me? - It's okay, you were shot. - Shot, what? - There was an attack downtown. - An attack? What's happening to my arm? - They don't know yet. They've been running all sorts of tests for a few days now. The CDC are here. They think it might be one of the attacks they've been warned about. - A few days? How many people have been infected? You, you have to go, you have to get somewhere safe. - No one else, it's just you. You're the first victim right now. We're all under observation. They won't let us leave this room. Isaac, what's happening? Please help him! (Isaac groaning) Isaac, it's okay. (tense music) - I've checked his blood work again, he does have the virus. - Then why isn't he showing symptoms like the rest? - This glow, this hue, it must be blocking it. - This wasn't part of the plan. The virus wasn't designed to do this. We have to tell him. - Tell me what, gentlemen? - He has the virus, he's just not showing any symptoms. - He's immune, sir. - Immune? Realize what this means? More of these hues continue to show up, it could jeopardize our entire plan. Everything that we've worked for could be for nothing! Now, I want you to stop it, and I want you to find out why. Let's gain control of the situation before it gets out of hand. - Yes sir. - Yes sir. We'll need more, sir. - More what? - More hues to do blood work, prepare lab results. - I can get you more. Let me worry about rounding up more of these hues. You worry about stopping it. - [Scientist] Yes sir. - The company is counting on you. If I were you, I wouldn't let them down. (tense music) - Isaac! Can you hear me? I've got to get you out of here. I don't know, these people are all over the place now. I don't know if they're scientists, or military or what. I heard them talking, they're keeping you sedated like this, asleep, so they can watch you. They're talking of moving you to some other private facility. I don't know what's going on. People are acting very strange, angry, and violent. I'm scared, Isaac. I'm going to go get help. I'm going to find your brother. If you can hear me, fight it, Isaac. Don't listen to them, fight it and wake up, please! Isaac, no. Isaac, I love you! - Hey, excuse me. - Can I help you, sir? - Yeah, I'm looking for my brother. - Okay, what's your brother's name? - Isaac Ward. - All right, give me one second. Ward, Ward. I'm sorry sir, we don't have any patients here with that name. - Look again. It's Isaac Ward, W A R D. You brought him in here a few days ago in an ambulance. Look, I know he's here. - I checked again sir, and that name is not listed. - Look, I know he's in this hospital. - Sir, I need you to calm down. - Hey, I am calm, now what I need you to do is tell me where my brother is! - Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, or I'll have you removed. - Okay. Okay. Don't want any trouble. - Jerry? - Hey Vic, you okay? - Where are you? - I'm outside. I went in there to see him, and they said he's not even here. - What? What do they mean, he isn't here? - I mean they're saying they have absolutely no record whatsoever of an Isaac Ward ever being in this hospital. - I just saw him. They just dragged me out of his room. - Wait, what do you mean dragged you out? - Something is not right. I feel bad about things. Everything is just so weird in here. - Trust me, I know exactly what you're talking about. - I've heard things, okay? They're doing things to him, keeping him asleep. I'm scared. - Hey, hey. It's gonna be all right. It's gonna be okay. - Okay. - Now look, I'ma find a way to get him out of here, you can trust me, but first I gotta make sure that you're all right. Can you get out? - Yeah, I think so. - All right, do you remember that pizza place that we would go to back in high school? - Yeah, yeah. - All right, it's a few blocks from here. I want you to get out of there, I want you to go straight there and meet me there in 15 minutes. - Okay, I'll meet you there. (dramatic music) (Jerry groaning) - There there, Mr. Ward, you'll be just fine. In fact, you'll be better. (Jerry groaning) (tense music) Now normally I'd let you breathe this stuff in, like the rest of this miserable society, but I find that takes entirely too long. Doesn't pack as much of a punch, if you know what I mean. Plus, I've got big plans for you. - Who are you? What did you do? - The name's Donovan, I'm here to help. (Jerry panting) - I don't need help. - (laughs) Your family's in danger, Mr. Ward. - Don't (groans), don't you touch them. - Who me? No, no, no, no, that's not what I do. I'm sure by now you've heard of these infected hues. They pose a great danger to us all, Jerry. If they aren't contained, well things are gonna get much worse, that's what I do. Your brother is one of these hues, Jerry. That puts you and your family at risk. (Jerry laughing) (tense music) - My brother a hue? What do you want me to do? - Bring them to me, all of them. They will resist, but stay vigilant. Together we will build a new world. Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe you have somewhere to be. (tense music) (Jerry laughing) - Though they are still searching for the origins, experts are now saying the outbreak is likely spread through body fluids, mainly by blood contact. The full list of side effects of the virus is still unknown, other than affected areas glowing with extreme intensity. If you see a hue affected person, please inform your local authorities immediately, so that they can get the proper care and testing at a local facility. - Jerry! - Come on, let's go. - Wait, did you find out anything? - It's not safe here, come on, come on! - Where are we going? - Let's go! - How are we gonna get him out? - We're not. - What? You said we're gonna... - No. He's a hue now. - What is wrong with you? He's your brother. (Jerry laughing) - I've been enlightened. - What? - The hues caused this chaos, they are the real threat! - You're being ridiculous. Jerry, please, I can't do this without you. - No! (Jerry groaning) (tense music) God! - Jerry, what is wrong? (Jerry groaning) You're scaring me! What is wrong? (Jerry groaning) - I don't want to, God. I don't want to, I don't want to. (Jerry groaning) I don't. (groans) I don't want to, I don't want to. I don't. There was a man. - Someone did this to you? - He stuck (groans), he stuck me in the neck. Run. Run. Run! Run! - I can't leave you like this. - Run, Vic! - I can't leave you like this... - Run Vic, now! Go! Run! - Stop it! (Jerry groaning) Stop it! - I have to turn you in. He said he wants you too. - Jerry, snap out of it! - You'll see. - No! - He said there's a better world waiting. (Jerry groaning) (Jerry laughing) I didn't want it to go this way. (Jerry laughing) (gunshot firing) I'm sorry, I'm so, so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. - [Victoria] Jerry, please. - It'll be okay, it will. - Jerry, please. - [Jerry] I'm sorry, it'll all be okay. - Go, find your parents. Leave her to me. I've got her. (tense music) (hissing) (heavy breathing) (distorted tv noise) Counter attack. (reporter stuttering) Everyone encouraged to take shelter immediately, far away from the central. I repeat again, the president has issued an immediate evacuation of all major US cities in the Central Gulf, and along the eastern shoreline. It has been confirmed this morning that US intelligence that England has launched its massive counter attack against the United States, still denying any responsibility for the hue virus attacks. It has been reported that intercontinental ballistic missiles are launched, and are in route to the United States. Everyone is urged to take shelter immediately, as far away from the central cities as possible. - The hell is going on? (tense music) - Understood. Well, an objective has been sent down by company leaders. We will take the first hue, and transfer him to a more secure location. The media spin on the bounties is working, but it's taking too long. The country attacks are escalating. It's no longer safe here. Let's find that first hue, take him to company headquarters. There's gotta be no loose ends. What do we know with the family? - Parents, they live downtown. - The fiance is missing still, hospital. - That older brother won't be giving us anymore problems. Once the first hue is secured, take out the family, the parents and the finance, is that understood? - Yes sir. - All right, now, let's go bag ourselves a hue. - Today Julie, hurry up! What took you so long? - I had to finish the broadcast. - It's the end of the damn world, and you're in there playing mrs humanitarian. Always for the people, this and that. (sirens wailing) - Have you been drinking again? - Yeah, so what I've been drinking. Been chasing them stupid hues all morning, I deserve a little reward. - What? - Yeah, turned in two already. Got ourselves a real slippery one back there now. Gotta make a little stop before we leave. - Honey! - Don't touch her, don't touch her, don't you touch her! She's infected. - She is our daughter. - She's a damn hue. - What did you do to her? What did he do to you? Are you okay? - Gave me the real slip this morning, but I got her, just like I got those other two. - You can't do this. - I can, Julie. Hell, you said it, on your damn news show. Gotta turn in the hues for proper care and testing. I'm not getting infected, I'm stopping it. Oh hell, here comes one now. - Phillip. Phillip, stop, no, you can't. Phillip, you can't do this. Stop. Stop. (tense music) - Hey, you tryna leave the city? I can help. Hurry, we're about to leave. (head impact) - Stay in the car, lock the doors. - Come on, help me tie her up. - Phillip, stop, you can't do this, stop. (slapping) - This is something we have to do, hues must be stopped. (tense music) (tires screetch) (monitor beeping) (tense music) - Wait, wait please, my girlfriend. The woman who was with me earlier, have you seen her? - A hue! - What, why are you running? Please, stop, I'm not gonna hurt you, I just need to know if she's okay. - Get away from me. - I'm not trying to hurt you, please. Stop! I just need to know if she's okay, please. - Get away from me. - Why are you running from me? No, listen, I just need some help. Why won't anyone help? - [Nurse] Please! - I can explain! Will you just... - Stop! - Please just tell me what's going on. Come on! I just need to make sure she's okay, please! - [Nurse] I can't help you. - Listen, please. - No! (screams) (head impact) - Look, her name is Victoria, I just need to. Stop running. - No, get away from me. - I can help you. Will you just tell me what's going on, please? - Get away from me. - Please just stop a second. Stop, please. (tense music) (sirens) Wait, no, why are you running? Where are you running? - Please someone help! - What's going on? Just help. Wait! - Help! Somebody help. (gunshots firing) (sirens wailing) Help, help. - Please, somebody help. - Come here, get down. - Someone help. - Hey stop, what are you doing? You're hurting them. What are you doing? Stop, leave them alone. - Come here! - Officers, officers. They're hurting these people, help them! Do something. - Get it. - [Isaac] Help them. - Officer, come on man, there's hues over here. - Yeah, we got three now. He's with us. - [Officer] It's you. - Officer. I'm sorry. - I need you to come with me. - Me? No, do something about them, they're hurting them. - [Man] Please! - I got more infected in 30 Maple, I need immediate assistance for pickup. - No, no, he's our too, man, he's our. - No, that one's mine. - Fine, where do we turn the hues in? - I'm sorry. - Over at the convention center, but you better hurry up, it's getting packed in there. The whole city's about to go down. - Come on! Get up. Come on. - There's not too much time. - You can't just let them take them like that. What the hell is going on? - Those people are infected hues. We're rounding all you up, keep you safe. Keep us safe. I'm only gonna tell you this once, I need you to come with me. We can't have your kind infecting everyone else. - I'm not infected, I was shot, you were there. - Look at you, look at your skin. I don't wanna have to hurt you, but I will. All hues must be turned in for proper care and testing. I will hurt you. - No, no! (gunshots firing) - Couldn't have gone far, find him. (tense music) - Come on. Mom, dad, Jerry, oh thank goodness. Look, everyone's going insane. We have to find Victoria and get out of here. Right, come on. What are you doing? Where'd you park, where's the car? - I can't let you do that. - What, Jerry, come on, man, not you too. - All infected hues must be reported to proper authorities. Cannot let this infection spread. - So I've heard, but Jerry, this is mom and dad, man, come on. - Please son. Take me, but let your mother go. - Shut up! - No, dad! - Stop, stop. You stay back. You stay back. You're gonna need to come with me too, brother. You're one of them. - Stop it! - Jerry, man. I'm not infected, come on, man. - Look at your freaking skin, look at it, look at it! The hell is wrong with you? You're a hue, just like they said. I was there, I watched you turn. Look, don't make this harder than it's gotta be. They said that they would help us, the more and more hues that we would turn in. We can't let it, we can't let it spread. All infected hues must be reported to proper authorities. Stop it! Get in, get in. - [Isaac] Look, look Jerry, let's just find Victoria, and let's get out of here man, come on. - I shot her. - You what? - She chose to be difficult, she wouldn't just come along, man, so... - So what? - So what? So I shot her! (Isaac groaning) - No, no, no! (gunshot firing) No! No, no, dad. What the hell's the matter with you? You're insane! (Isaac groaning) (mom crying) - Maybe, but at least I'm not infected. - What? No, no! (gunshot firing) (Isaac crying) No! (Isaac groaning) - What's it gonna be, brother? Huh? That's what I thought. (Isaac groaning) Hey, hey, hey! (phone ringing) - Just peachy. It's them. They'll need an update. Go and find him. Bring him to me. We're in pursuit of him now. I understand. We'll handle it. (banging) (sirens wailing) (tense music) - [Jerry] Look at your freaking skin. Look at it! - [Victoria] Get you out of here. - [Doctor] That's nothing anyone's ever seen before. (woman screaming) (sirens wailing) (gunshots firing) (tense music) - [Man] Why these hues different from us? - [Reporter] If you see a hue. (tense music) - Okay, you two have got to keep these on for me, okay? Promise me, you've gotta keep this one for me, especially you. (kisses) Do not let them see you. Come on. (dramatic music) Wait, wait. My baby, no, no! - Mommy! - [Woman] My daughter! (tense music) (girl screaming) - Come on, it's gonna be okay, come on. (dramatic music) Wait, wait, wait. Wait here, that's good. Its gonna be okay. Here, this, take this, put this on your head. Don't let anyone see you. Okay, it's gonna be okay. We're gonna find your mom, all right? Right here. Wait, wait, wait. This way. Is that them? Is it your mom? (sirens wailing) (tense music) (car horn honking) Go, go, go. (sirens wailing) (tense music) - I know you're in here. Isaac. Isaac. You're sick, Isaac. I just wanna help you. - You liar! (tense music) - I shot 'em, mom, dad, Victoria. (Jerry groaning) Oh my God, what have I done? - Why? Jer, why'd you do it? - I don't know. Something's happening though. - What is happening? You've gone crazy. - I said I don't know. I just don't feel right. Please. Please. Please help me, brother. - Okay. Just put down the gun. (tense music) (gun clattering) What's wrong with you? Where have you been? - I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. First they took you away, then we couldn't find you, then the attacks, then the riots, the infection. - Okay, okay, just calm down, just calm down. - No! They said you'd do this. The hues would do this, the infected, would do all this! - Jerry, listen to yourself, you're just rambling. - No, this is your fault. - You aren't making any sense. - You did this, it's your fault they're dead. - You shot them. (Jerry groaning) Jerry, no. No! (punch impact) You don't have to do this, Jerry. Stop, don't, please. - No, come here. (dramatic music) (Isaac groaning) - Jerry, don't. - Isaac, can you hear me? Can you hear me? - [Jerry] What happened? - [Victoria] Isaac! - [Jerry] Come here, come here, come here. - [Doctor] I've never seen anything like it before in my life. - Fight it, Isaac. Isaac, if you can hear me, fight it. Wake up. - Fight this, Isaac, come and find me. (Jerry groaning) (Isaac coughing) (tense music) - They said the hues would resist. We should stay vigilant. Stop the infection. Rebuild this new world. Do you hear me, Isaac? Huh? This is something I have to do. You understand? (metal banging) (Jerry groaning) (dramatic music) No! No! No! - Who told you that? (Jerry laughing) - What does it matter? Huh? (Jerry laughing) (tense music) What does it matter, man? (laughs) And you know what, you know what? It's all your fault. Yeah, even your precious Victoria. (Jerry groaning) (Jerry laughing) They're dead. Mom, dad, even your precious Victoria. (laughs) (Jerry groaning) (Jerry laughing) - Goodbye Jerry. - No! No! Run hue, run! They gonna hunt you! Go on. Run! Hunt you to the end of the Earth. Hunt the hues. (Jerry groaning) (sirens wailing) (tense music) - Please. - Get it out, let me on the bus. Let me on the bus. (crowd yelling) - Get out! (crowd yelling) - I can't get on here. Don't let them on. No hues! (crowd yelling) - I'm gonna die out here. Please! - Your kind's not allowed here hue. (crowd yelling) (tense music) (banging) - No hues allowed! Get off the bus, we're done, get out of here. - Let me on. Let me on. - [Man] Get away from the bus. Get off the bus. Get off the bus. Get away from the bus. - [Passenger] Stay clear of the bus. - [Man] Get off the bus. - [Passenger] Get away, get away. - Please! (tense music) (banging) - Well gentlemen, I'm going to assume that since you are now carrying a squirming, glowing freak of a hue, he alluded your grasp. Maybe you have him gift wrapped in the back somewhere for me. Where the hell is he? - He made it onto a evacuation bus. - Bus, to where? - Bus is heading west. - West, huh? (phone beeping) It's them. They're not gonna be happy. Yes? No, we don't have the first. A bus. West. I understand. Well gentlemen, I've got some good news and I've got some bad news. The bad news is, we're unemployed. The good news is, you work for me now. Let's head out, this city is going to burn. We've got a hue to catch. (dramatic music) - [Isaac] Can you feel it? The world is changing. No one knows why, or where it came from, all we know is, we have to run. They call us hues because we are different. We are outcast, we are hunted, experimented on, but we are no different than before. We are no different than them. So we will run, we will hide, we will lurk in the shadows, and when the time is right, we will fight back. We will fight for equality. Will you join us, or hunt us? Yes, I was the first, I will not be the last.
