And your name, too. - Palja! -Come on, come on. And where are you running? - Where am I running? Here, Becanijska Street. See? Do you know what that means?

We parted a hundred years ago. I don't even remember your name. Zoja. Klava. Excursion. - What's that name? In short, this is artistic neighborhood. No Thanks. Artists gather, paintings work, and the paintings on the walls are called murals. Is that me? Not. It's just some girl. And who painted it? - I do not know. I don't know these artists, I'm rarely here. Hi, Paul. - Hi, sorry. I'm a little tired. You set that pace. Let's go to the hotel. I still remember your measures. I hope that you didn't gain weight. I'll meet you at 8 at the hotel Iika Duljane, we saw something... In short, we saw Paul with his girlfriend. It's humanity on the threshold of a new era.

Hey love, where are you? Sorry, I was really busy. Chaos before the wedding. How's it going? Disaster! The boy has nothing to do with dance. I'm going to pee. She totally freaked me out. Brother... There is an old Serbian saying: there is no truth in the legs. It's a Russian saying. - International. A second. Mr. Dulan! How are you? I know what you want to ask. Who is that girl? - An investor from Moscow. And why are you with the investor from Moscow running away from us? Because you... you idiots! You beat first and then you ask questions about that. How to invest in such conditions? And what do you want an investor for? So how do I do? I have to grow my business a little bit. We don't want Vedranica and I all a century to be on your hump? I want to provide the future for your daughter. Sorry, son-in-law. I got a little upset. Does not matter. Let's have you and me go to me. We sit down to get some brandy. And yes about everything we talk like people. Take your Russian friend. Where? Take it easy. I'm calling for a drink. I don't drink.

Come on, son-in-law, come back. Nobody will touch you. Family is sacred to me. And with the family friend, what's up? What about her? She's not going well. But can we somehow see to solve this problem? We can't handle it. She hit me. She hit my cousin. It offended my whole family. Good.

What I'm going to show you now no guide will show you that. Just not believe it. What a beautiful flower created a universe. Jealousy, bro, good can you put on your pants in front of your wife? Woman, man - what's the difference? The soul has no sex. You can stuff it pants on your soul? The body is clothing longer. You're wearing two pants? Maybe we should take a cab? No, you don't. The better the water, the faster. Hey, do you want that with us? And how different? Good. Palja? -AND? What is it? going on? Just be quiet. Do you know what day it is? Wednesday? My birthday.

Paul, Grandpa! - Where you are, don't get up. How long have we not seen each other, woe how happy I am to see you. I'm sorry you're beautiful. - How are you? Great! I had a heart attack yesterday, but small. Dark for my age. Don't worry. By the way, I heard you were brought the bride to the village. Is that true? Did you hear that? That. You know I fantasize before that I die only to marry you. And almost everything. Let's see it there your beauty, to see her. Come on, come on. Good, Grandpa Milolje. We gather. You quickly gathered. There he came and that day for me to see the bride of her own beloved grandson of Paul. Yes, you'll see it. And where is Dalja? And what? Is that your bride? That's what I'm about wanted to talk... Palja... - Palia, Palia... - There! Where is Palja? Fire, help! Tell her yes I'm not a lover. Are you normal? That's Paul's bride. You hear what he says, that's Paul's bride? A woman from Russia came, I was showing her the village. This one is not normal. Sweetheart, calm down. Put your ax down. Longer, big dealers. Paul, is that true? Truth. Then nothing. - I love you. - Me too. - What does he say? - Love him. Silence! Who is that? -Grandfather. You were angry with our Paul what did not invite us to Belgrade for a wedding. You called him any names. Idiot, jerk, Belgrade picopevac. I made up everything. I believed in Paul that they won't fuck us. And he didn't forget us invites you to your wedding in Belgrade but brought wedding to our village. Wedding? Usadba. Similar words. What's going on? They found out you were Russian, and they love the Russians very much here. When Putin came Serbia has taken to the streets. Come on, here. - Come on. Sit down. - Give me brandy. - More, more. Thank you. And what is this? Old Serbian tradition. Hearts on the table. I think I know that tradition. When the Russians call the village to the wedding. Usadba. And they ask the girl out for the guy. That? How long? subtract give him that bell. My dear neighbors. This is hopefully a sunny day. - Sorry, I wanted to admit it to you. When? On ours silver wedding? It's all about Grandpa. All my life dreamed of my wedding. Knowing me, it may not work. Especially since it is had a heart attack yesterday. It's with you it always does. First you agree and then everything turns into an avalanche. Sorry. He'll finish now and I'll admit it. Good? And I'm not ashamed to admit it that in front of the whole village. What's wrong with him? -Grandfather. Call the doctor. Nothing, nothing. Reduce infarction. All right, I'll support you. - Have them be married for a hundred years. Cheers! Cheers! Whoa, young. Next, what's wrong with you? -What is it? Just a minute take. -That? -That. I understand. What is it? What are we looking at? It's a Russian tradition. Hey cheers! What? What is this? A man. What's going on? Hi. -Hi. Just to her I give a passport. Passport. Passport! Thank you. That's my bridal gift. -Super! And I will I'll collect and I'll give you one. Come on, you already are Delio. -Razdelio? I split everything, free. Fool. Listen to him everyone loves? -Whom? And Paul. You know, him it helps us a lot. I don't know how lived without him. That? And how does it help you? - How? He built everything. He built the road. He rented a bus who drives the kids to school. His buddy is the best doctor in Belgrade. Everyone comes to us month to review. You know, all that money hotel, everything it earns everything here sends. To the village. Take him more that bell. Folks, it's a tradition in Russia that there is a "bitter" cry at the wedding. Well, it seems logical to me newlyweds love for this weather. But we are in Serbia. But she's a young Russian. Then: bitter, bitter. It's on what's going on. Avalanche. Don't worry, I won't kiss you. What, what do we tell them? - Bitter, bitter, bitter. Next, what's wrong with you? You have a husband, tomorrow you will to return to him. I will not. - Petja .. - Far... We've spoken a thousand times already. Look... You don't understand. And how do I understand? You're flying to Mars. To the other end, we will never see each other again. Far, flight to Mars is the year of beginning. The beginning of a new era. Humanity is colonizing another planet. And with Ilon Mask. So yeah, just that he doesn't fly. It doesn't matter. Flight is his idea. Oh..I see. Family, children, dog, it's all good but to give life to a new planet... So, here I go. Are you kidding me? No, you're kidding. Like I like to joke. And worse. To Mars. To the other end. My head is about to explode. It will not. Not even when I do said why he was divorcing. And you haven't tried it long distance connection? Sorry. Why are you wearing a ring? To me like you... they would not be bored. Let's dance. Please help me. I called him, he's not answering. Please let me go. All right, let him go. - Hold him. I can't do it alone. What? Boy, what are you doing? Help Nebojsa. Pull it out. John, John, John. You're not bad. Really? -That. I'm sure you'll find it a common language with Vedran. Until her bride returns you will be her party. Fun? -That. Yes, Ivan, Ivan. All right, good night. Sleep well. You don't. Good luck! -We are waiting for a good day. Let's go, let's go. Don't worry, it's quick get thin so I'll leave. What is this? It's a potion to make your soldier guarded the whole night. It's that the head doesn't hurt after joy. Here. They are diverging. DULJAN Honey, bro... Aye take me to Belgrade. I drank. You don't even have a permit. Uri. Get up, Paul is gone. You know, Dulan maybe and the better you broke it. The others have increased their prices significantly. But I do not recommend breaking this one. Two robberies in a month. Now these urinals are guarded better than the president. This is not a urinal. This is art. Wait for me, I'll get it. Boss, look who we found. But we didn't look for him, he came alone. Mr. Duljane, I'm canceling my wedding. I can't marry to your daughter. Well... take my hotel. You want to grieve my daughter? And what will be her nothing like me? Agree, I don't know either. But you like her. But in Serbia it is real so many tall and nice guys. I am 3 plus by those measures, 4 minus the maximum. But that's why I have a hotel in downtown Belgrade, and with your connections you can open a casino and at the casino a strip club. Imagine, naked croupier. The idea? No, wait. Imagine a girlfriend, not a boyfriend. There is no such thing in Belgrade. Naked casino. But you glued it nicely. When it's new. Because you are new. Put that in place. Just one question. What's so expensive? When there are more. How many more are there? I'm taking your hotel away! Fair enough. And you're getting married tomorrow to my daughter. And that's fine. That's it. Thank you. I'll call your grandfather and the whole village for the wedding. Thank you. If you try to run their bodies will swim across the Danube. I'm going to tell them. You're not going anywhere. Good. I have to call the greens from Moscow and ask for 100 million. I thought the club would be alone make money when I open it. Good for you. You have your own business in Moscow. You're free. And I? I live in a gold cage. I have a lot of money, but I can't go anywhere. Because my dad doesn't. Hey, look at this. Rarity. Love, Paul has arrived. Palja came? -Yes. - You'll talk tomorrow. Go to the hotel. Do you want to stay with us? Do we have quite a few rooms? Yes. We apologized well. Then someone will fix your room. What can I say next? Tell her... Don't tell her anything. I'll call her myself. All right, brew! Enough with playing. Don't wait for me anymore. Who the fuck! Give it to him. Kusur. We needed more play two songs. Let's get out there. Come here. Hey, I left the phone. I forgot my phone in the car. I really have to I call. Srezko! Stop! Dulyan said that there is no call. I really have to. Go to sleep. You like to lie down early. Go. Come on. Hello. Hi, Dala. And you... And that pays you off invited to the wedding? I forgot. Probably. And what kind of wedding? Paljina and Vedranina. Not up to date? Where are you going? - At the airport. I'll take you. I called a cab. I brought you, I'll take you. And my grandfather wants to say goodbye to you. Go. Do you know what it is Diljan's fountain? No, I do not know. He broke that toilet. But it's not a toilet, it's a fountain. Art. And he did it by accident. He's a good man. Now it's Dulan's debtor. And that's why there is nothing now. No hotels. Just a horrible bride. Today will be a wedding. It's Sam's fault. Constantly lying. - And he's not lying. It bypasses the truth. What's the difference? One thing the same. Big. A lie is a sin. And bypassing the truth coercive measure. It's all for love. What kind of love? Beloved do not deceive. If he had said right away they would have found a way out. Now let's do it alone. Careful. What did we even get here? Let's go, let's go. I am my Silver at the age of 18 met. And I immediately proposed it. She agreed. The wedding was a joy. But after dawn family life. Small misunderstandings, quarrels, as with all people. We used to quarrel once that she took off the ring and threw it into the river. When I saw it, I took it off threw his wedding band into the river. After a month we didn't say a word. Not a single word. In the end, I couldn't stand it. And I took the night off. And with that night alone carved two wedding rings. And again he applied. Let's make a second wedding. The whole village was cheerful. And so it was kind of a tradition. We liked it so much that from then on, whenever we quarrel I ask her out and let's make the wedding. And so five, six, seven times. Who will remember now?! And then Srebrenka died. So I dreamed yes I marry Paul to remember that time I did peace with Srebrenko. Therefore, make peace with Paul while you still can you start all over again. Let's go to the hotel. Come on. To be with him in good and evil. May I have your invitation. In illness and health. Wealth and poverty It's burning! I'm here. - Until death breaks you apart. It's not that wedding. There was a rehearsal here. Excuse me, sorry. The wedding is at another restaurant. In the fresh air. Why didn't you tell me right away? You said we were going to the hotel and I brought you. How did I know you would to the toilet or something. Go. Look, I don't have any money now. You understand. And I... Disgusting, sour. Okay, so I got ready. - It's old wine. What are you doing? You see how they are guests. Give it a go, let it go. If Duljan sees you you know what will happen to you.
