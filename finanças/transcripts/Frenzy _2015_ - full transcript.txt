Presents A co-production between With the support of Written and directed by Kadir Tuğsuz! This way. - Have a good night. - Good night, sir. In the name of god. What the hell! FRENZY So, you are Kadir Tuğsuz, right? Yes, sir. Sit down. Tell me Kadir. - How many years has it been? - 20, sir. Quite a bit. - How many more? - 2 years, sir. Yes, Kadir Tuğsuz. - Nihat recommended you. - Bless him. He said you're a hard worker, trustworthy. - Is that so? - That's right, sir. Well, let's see. They told you about the job. Officially, it's parole. - They told me sir, but... - Parole! As the name implies, we have conditions, Kadir. This job is secret. If it gets out in the open in any way, if it gets known, parole is off the table. God, no! You won't appear as our employee. - Don't forget that. - OK. The job comes with its own salary. - You'll find it sufficient. - OK. If you perform well, you might get a permanent position. I hope so, sir. Caution is so important in this job. Nothing comes easy. I believe in you. Let's see how you work. Don't embarrass us. Yes, sir. Get off. Form a line! Single line. IDs? In line! Show your ID's. Let me check your bag. Move on! Faster! Move ahead. OK, pass. Hello. Hello. What the hell? Don't you recognize me? No one's here? The children? I want to see them. They're not here. They went to the village. - The village? - Yeah. Why didn't you go? Work. I heard about you from cousin Feyyaz. You're working for the municipality. You never visit Feyyaz and his family. They're upset, just so you know. I really don't have the time. Well, I was just wondering why it's so dark here. Let's open the curtains, let some light in. Your house is nice. Bravo. I'm staying in a place like a hotel. But it's not too bad. It's alright. You have children. I didn't want to disturb you. Not at all, brother! Still, one shouldn't squat in someone else's house. Look... A bomb like this, it can kill at least two or three people on a busy street. Even more with a bigger propane tank. In a busy area, you wouldn't stand a chance. Al least 10 people. But they are not much used any more. They're out of fashion, something for the poor. Now there are chemicals. Some have strong odours, I will have you smell all of them. You will learn the smells, colors, and names of all of them by heart. What you find in trash containers... You will report everything to me. - OK? - OK, sir. Let's start from the beginning. This guy Fatih works for the municipality... He has a small shop on the corner. - Which one? - The one that just closed down. - Well, that's what he rented. - A shop there wouldn't go well... - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - My Ahmet, how are you? - Fine, brother, thanks. Ali... My big brother... - Glad you're back out. - Thanks. About the floor over Ali's place... We can have a look. - Sure, let's go. - Let's have tea first. - We can have tea another time. - OK then. No problem. As you see, we couldn't paint. It looks unfinished. We'll fix it up when we can. That will happen in time. This house seems too big for me. - It's big. - One room is enough for me. Then close out the back rooms. We won't charge rent for those rooms. - How much do you ask? - We'll talk later. Let's go downstairs and eat, I'm starving. - I don't want to bother you. - You're not. Come on. Come on, come on. Well. Meral! Meral? Come here, we have guests. - Welcome. - Thank you. Kadir is Ahmet's big brother. Really? Very nice to meet you, welcome. Thanks a lot. - He might be our new tenant. - Let's hope it works out. God willing. And who's this man? - Hello. - It has been a while. Come on, let's go in. Come on in. We look for paper, cans, iron and stuff to sell. - OK then. - For real. A toast to Kadir's new job! Slow down! Look at that. Don't pick on Ahmet! Listen, don't drink too much. No passing out here. We love Ahmet dearly. We tell him to drop by, but he hasn't been around. Look, pass the rakı glass before his nose like this... He will get drunk instantly. It's that quick. Really. Well, you know my Ahmet better. I will get to know him in time. He was just a kid when I went to prison. He was 7 years old at most. Were you 7, Ahmet? Yeah. You weren't, you weren't. Then he was younger. Then I got out, came home and he was a man. Ahmet is blessed with a home, a wife and kids... God grant us all, he has a peaceful home. - Amen. - Amen. What peace? What is it, Ahmet? The bitch Şennur, grabbed the kids and ran away. How Ahmet? The bitch ran to a guy for sure. “Check points mean isolation!” “Stop the blockade!” - This is delicious, thanks. - Glad you like it. My apologies for imposing. Moving in took all day, you must be tired. The soup is really very delicious. It's not much, just noodle soup from broth. - Ahmet really likes this soup. - Why didn't we invite him? I went by at noon. He wasn't home. I'll go after dinner and see what he's up to. - Let me come with you. - Sure, come. Maybe he can't hear the bell. There are no lights on. Ali! Come over here, look. Is someone sitting in the couch? Take a look. Nope. No? - Good evening. - Good evening. Do you have a table? No, tables are at the furniture store. Go ask him. At the corner. He's Kadir. Ahmet's brother. He's new to the neighborhood. Let's welcome him. - Welcome, brother. - Thanks, brother. - We're going in. - Go on. - Hello everyone. - Hello. - Good evening. - Good evening. What's this? Why all the secrecy? - It's the neighborhood tavern. - Well! - Can everybody come here? Members only. How so? Of course, everybody! Why not? What do I know? This place is illegal. No tax, no license. My God. This country is getting so strange. Has it really changed? Of course, it did. Everybody's sitting in their holes... - Doing weird things... - I guess so. - Smoke? - No, thanks. It wasn't like this 20 years ago. Then we had trouble getting bread on the table. Now people are afraid for their lives. I really wonder how this country will get rid of terrorism. How should I know? - Let's have a drink. - Sure. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello, Ali. - How are you, Ferhat? - Fine, and you? - Not too bad. This is Kadir. Ahmet's brother. - Welcome. - Thank you. - Which Ahmet? - From the market street. I see. - Drink with us. - I have to check on my guys. See you later. Maybe he's not home. Ali! Come over here, look. Is someone sitting in the couch? Take a look. - Nope. - Whatever, let's go then. Over there. He ran this way? What's up, Ahmet? You've never missed before. What miss? Didn't you see? I hit him in the leg. He whimpered and ran. - No way! - He'll soon fall down and die. - He ran this way? - Yes. Oh come on, Nuri. - Kadir? - Hi, how are you? Fine, thanks. I brought Ahmet some noodle soup. - The one we had. - Good idea, thanks. See you later. - Say hi to Ali. I will. Drop by some evening. God willing, we'll see. What are you up to, my Ahmet? Whatever, brother. What's in your hand? Meral forgot her hairclip. I thought she'd come back. Come on in. Why don't you answer the phone? It must be broken, it doesn't ring. I must get it fixed. Shall we buy you a cell phone? - No, I don't know how to use one. So how can I reach you? I keep calling, you don't pick up. I dropped by last night, you weren't home. - I'm always home. - I swear, you weren't. - Did you make soup? - No, Meral brought it. Does she come here often? Once in a while. Never mind. Listen, Ahmet... My dear brother... I thought about it a lot. We should look for your wife. Damn her! Think of your children. Isn't it a sin? Must they grow up with a stepfather? Leave the finding part to me. I will find her in 2 hours. Do you want some soup? Sorry, I didn't ask. No, thanks. Give me Meral's hairclip, I'll drop it off this evening. - What kind of soup? - Noodle. From broth? Well, yeah. Come have dinner with me in the evenings. - OK? - Hmm. - What's that noise? - Which noise? Didn't you hear? Like a baby crying. Whatever, I'm leaving. - Good night. - Close the furnace before bed. - Will do. Alright. - Kadir? - Meral, how are you? Fine, thanks. Come in. Ah, no. Is this yours? I've been looking for hours. I left it at Ahmet's? - Hmm. - Come in. - No, thanks. - Why not, come in. - Why that move? - The dice decide. There it is. Six and one! Quiet, you'll wake up Ali. Are you a sore loser? - Come on, come on. - There, here you go! 3, the other is a dead number. Meral, I want to ask you... Did Ahmet ever mention me? I mean before, while I was in prison? Of course. Why wouldn't he? Really? What did he tell? Let's see... He talked mostly about your childhood. Oh really. How you raced boats on the river. You made pretty boats from bark... Then you raced them together on the river. - That wasn't me. - How so? It was Veli, our middle brother. He was good with his hands. He made nice boats. When I was jailed, they came to İstanbul. Veli is four years older than Ahmet. Then Veli disappeared suddenly. 10 years ago, no news whatsoever. Who knows what he's doing? Right, Ahmet mentioned him. Maybe you'll hear about him. No way, or we would have heard by now. Kadir? Meral. What happened? Does it hurt a lot? No, it's OK. Sorry to bother you at night. - I can go. - Go where? Let me bandage it. Good God. Why are you playing the hero? What can I do, Meral? That's my job. Which bastards did this? Who knows? I don't get it either. I hope we didn't wake up Ali. No, he sleeps like a log. Done. Leave the fires to the firefighters, OK? Alright. - Hello. - Hello. - Give me a half, please. - OK. Make that two. OK. Man, you're trouble. What are you doing? Slobbering on my hand, you bastard. Fuck off. Leave it. Idiot. Look. Your bed is here. Don't go out. OK? Don't get used to it, in two days I'll kick you out. Lie down. Where are you going? Didn't I tell you not to leave there? Shall I kick you out now? Did you get better, you trickster? Kick you out now? Are you healed? Come here. What? Take a step. Come on. Come! Come, come! Let go! Leave it! You'll tear it. Leave it! Bastard. Leave it! Look, I'll beat you. Bayram. Hello, how are you? - Fine, thank God. - Good. I wanted to come and see the market. - Good for you. - I brought things as well. I don't know if they will sell. Why not? But there are few. You need to fill up a stall. But I can sell them for you here. OK. What are you selling? Whatever I can find. - Is that a typewriter? - Yes. - Does it work? - It does. - Someone threw this out? - Yes. Ahmet... I can hear you. Open the door. Open it. I was in the toilet, sorry. Anyone in there? No. If you have guests, I don't want to disturb you. No, it's just the TV. Whatever. Come to my place. I cooked. - I ate already. - Come on... Put on your shoes. - Really, I already ate. - Come on, I said. I made stuffed grape leaves. Good that you ate before... Or you would eat the plate! Eat up. I was about to ring. I heard voices. Maybe some visitors. I told you, the TV was on. It's not my business anyway. You're a young man. You're tall, good-looking. Just be careful to not damage anyone's reputation. What does that mean? I didn't mean anything bad. Beware of temptation. Don't commit adultery, I'm saying. - Thanks. I should go. - Go where? - I have to get up early. - Sit down, for God's sake. Sit down, my Ahmet. How long has it been since we talked? Can't we speak like brothers? I know, it's not easy for you to get over. That's why you're cold towards me. Where did you get that idea? I just know and you're right. You should know... In prison, you were always on my mind. We only have each other. Only us two, you see. You're upset for nothing. I don't blame you at all. It's not about blame. You ended up in an orphanage so young. What you must have gone through... Don't... I didn't go through anything. Veli took care of me. Forget about Veli. I trusted only him. He disappeared and left you alone. - He still did good. - How so? Tell me for God's sake, is that being a brother? He suddenly left without a trace. Always untrustworthy! The other day I was walking on the street. A guy on a motorcycle came up behind me. He had his face covered with a scarf and hat. Only his eyes were visible. Just as he was passing by, I looked him in the eyes. I thought I recognized those eyes. Then I realized how much they look like Veli's. I was going to run after him. But he was gone. Sometimes I also mistake someone for Veli. I wondered if he had returned after all these years. - I hope it happens one day. - God willing. Ahmet? Ahmet! Come here. Idiot. Hey... Coni! I'm calling you. Come here. Listen, bastard. You'll pee and shit here, OK? I'm talking to you. Idiot. Come here. I won't do it, come back. Help me. Must I do everything myself? Ahmet! Ahmet, are you OK? Mr. Hamza, I did research in the neighborhood for some time. I looked into some people on my own. I wrote down all the information I got from the neighborhood. - I thought I should show you. - Well done, Kadir. Really. - Bravo, keep it up. - Thank you, sir. Will you have tea? No, thanks. If you don't mind, I have a favor to ask. Go on, Kadir. We have a middle brother. Veli Tuğsuz. He disappeared 10 years ago, into thin air. Never heard from him again. Not a single word. Maybe if there's something in the police records. Maybe if we looked, we could find him. OK, Kadir, we'll see. - 10 years, you said? - It's been 10 years. - Send some tea, girl. - I won't drink. Not for you. - Write his name down. - I need a pen. - Can I use this? - Sure. - Good morning. - Good morning. Ali or Meral are not here? Ali is out, Meral is in the kitchen. Come on in. No, thanks. I borrowed their teapot. I want to return it. I'm Meral's nephew. Please, come in. OK then. Since you're the nephew. - Please. What the hell? What's that smell? Did you fill up the tub? Did you? I'm talking to you. Look at me. You're out of water. Let me know. Come, here's your water. Bastard. I'm talking to you. Coni! You playing? Come out. Coni! Where are you? Coni! Coni! Ahmet, what are you doing? I took out the trash. Come on. Put on your clothes. - We're late, hurry. - OK, I'm coming. Wait, I saw something. - Where? - There! Slow down. It ran behind the house. There's nothing there. It ran behind the house. - Let's get out. - Don't hold us up for nothing. - Haluk, drive on. - Get out and look. Check if there's something. Get out. Good grief. - So? - Nothing. Idiot. - You should leave poison. - I did. Understood. We'll do that. OK, let's send this guy. Listen. You can go, OK? We're here setting up a police base. - Don't tell anyone. - OK, sir. - So we let him go? - He works for us. Sir... I know Meral and Ali very well. - I hope there's no mistake. - Go on, back to your work. Good God. Sir, what did they do? You'll know soon. Do your own job. Listen, don't tell anyone. - Hear me? - OK, sir. Go, go. İstanbul was shaken by bombings in three districts. According to police sources, 300 people were taken into custody, and the search for several more suspects continues... When did they set up the blockade? Last night. Leaving the neighborhood is prohibited now. What's going on there? Come here. You got hungry, that's why. Fuck off, no food for you now. Look at me. Are you going to run away again? What are you looking at? Gonna run away again? You bastard! Ahmet, open up. I see the lights. Ahmet, open the door. Go fuck yourself. Why should I care about you? Why are you so noisy? Why do you bark? As we said before, we need to finish quickly. I won't say too much. This job won't take months. The mayor gave strict orders. We must finish in two weeks. We will start an inspection as of today. We will visit each neighborhood. There won't be any animals left on the streets. Understood? Be quick! In two weeks the streets should be completely cleaned up. Hold on, hold on! Furkan Adalı, Ahmet Tuğsuz, Necip Taştan, Mehmet Öksüz. Mr. Vahap is waiting for you in his office. Bravo. Really, bravo. You thought we wouldn't hear about you. Excuse me, sir. Bravo. You're the smartest. How? What how? Tell me where you hide the dogs. Speak up! Swallowed your tongue? Sir... I swear, I didn't hide anything. Don't you have family? Don't you? Aren't you feeding meat to your family? Would you like feeding dog meat to your children, bastard? - Dog meat? - Yes! - No way. - So why sell dead dogs? - No, sir, I didn't. - Sir... For a penny! What kind of man are you? Who buys the dog meat? Sir, he has the injured hand. - What? - A dog bit him. - What dog? Oh, that's you. Good God, I got so angry. Hope you're better, son. I'm fine, sir, thanks. Let's send him to the municipality doctor. I already took off the bandage. That's why we called you. - I'm fine, sir, thanks. - Take care of your hand. We're fucked if anything explodes in front of us. We need time off. Right, Haluk? Until things calm down. They're testing us. Testing us for what? Who's testing us? - Vahap. - Why test us? What test? Nothing. Shut up! Shut up! Any old iron? Any old rags? Shut up, Coni Quiet. Don't be afraid. - Ahmet, why won't you tell me? - What, brother? Why are you avoiding me? Why are you hiding? Are you afraid I'll get mad? I don't know, I just couldn't tell you. - What? - Why report a dog? I will get rid of it once it's healed. Look, we're really offended. Me and Mr. Vahap really resent this. But I talked to Mr. Vahap. He brought stuffed grape leaves for Coni. - Stuffed grape leaves? - Look! What? Coni! Don't eat that! - Don't yell. - Don't! - Coni, don't eat that! - Ahmet, shut up! There is no truth to these claims. I have said many times... With the relevant departments of our municipality, we are tranquilizing dogs with a special rifle using a mix of Xylazine and Ketamine. All according to European standards. Then the animals are safely placed in municipal shelters by our official teams. Isn't this better now? What? I'll take it Off, but don't make a sound. OK? OK? Coni? Coni! Police! Open up! Open up! Police! Quiet Coni! Open up! Police! Open up now! Police! Open up! Police! Open up! Open up! Police! Ahmet, open up. I see the lights. Ahmet, open the door. Open it! Go fuck yourself. Why should I care about you? Hello? Kadir, it's Ali. Ali! Yes, it's me. Kadir, listen. What have you done? What have I done? Listen to me. Is it right what they said? I have something to tell you. How can I believe you? You must help Meral. Help with what, man? Help Meral. She's downstairs. Where? In the garden, behind the house. Where behind the house? The garden, inside the chicken coop. What? They were everywhere. She couldn't escape in time. During the raid, she jumped out of the window and hid. You should help her. Why is Meral in the coop? Kadir, I beg you, save her. Only you can get her out of the neighborhood. Ka... Kadir... Ali! Ali! Do you hear me? Meral? You're shaking, Meral! Let him pass. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. Godspeed! Meral! Get out, Meral! Meral! - Mustafa. - What? - Was it Rüstem this morning? - Which Rüstem? - That one. - Fuck off with your Rüstem. Good evening. You called me. Good evening. - Enjoy your drinks. - Have a seat. Do you want a drink? No, thanks. Things aren't going well, Kadir. - How so? - The police invested a lot in this job. Especially Mr. Hamza. But it's not working. Who knows why. You would know better than me. Kadir, come on. I'm asking you. Did we make a mistake? Sir... Since you're asking, I'll tell you. There are some serious obstacles. They probably know about what we're doing. They're working against us. A few days ago, they lit the garbage on fire. Who, your greengrocer? I don't know about him, but I'm investigating. You're investigating? So you wrote in the report! One by one, you work very carefully. You suspect absolutely everyone. But tell me... Why didn't you suspect your neighbor at all, Kadir? Are these guys that good? Or are you so naive? Or do you work together with them? - How can you say that? - Well, you must be naive. - They're right under your nose. - It's OK, Hamza. Explain to The attacks of the past two days... They are all in places where our presence is strongest, where our network is very well-founded. Come here, Kadir. Come come. Come. Smell this. What is it? Sulphate. I said from the start: they can't, let's use dogs. My nose is clogged, I couldn't really smell it. OK, Kadir, sit down. And then you prepared a report! Did we ask you for one? Just do your own job. But it's a remarkable report. Very organized. Even typed! You're suspicious about the greengrocer: “He always wants to prevent the garbage from being collected." Lists of people the greengrocer met. "Has a satellite antenna." Look at that! Listen, the adventure continues. "The coal seller is an Arab from Urfa." "His shop is always crowded." "He treats me in a hostile way." Look at the spy's intuition, what he caught here. Why are you so obsessed with the coal seller, Kadir? Are they making bombs from coal, and we don't know about it? They will soon start doing that! Kadir... You may be on the right path. Keep going. But watch out for curves. - What curves? - Well, the curves... Now that you mention curves... Şeref and the tire story came to mind. It's not the time for that. That's enough. Enough with Kadir. Back to our own jobs. Kadir, I'll see you off. Come on. Bring us the intelligence, OK? Or you'll be out of a job. Mustafa... We have to make Şeref tell that story. Don't screw me. Don't tell it without me! OK. Come on. Kadir, you're hardworking and motivated. - But you must use your brain. - OK, sir. Listen. Your brother... Veli. When did you see him last? It's been years, before I went to prison. - When did you say he disappeared? - It's been about 10 years. When we inquired into his name, we found something. Your brother matches with a criminal. Really? Veli Tuğsuz. If he's who we think, he's a very important member of the terrorist organization. - We're not sure, we'll see. - Are you sure it's Veli? Man, it's not sure. We'll see. Now listen. Keep working hard. I'll make a good intelligence officer out of you. Try harder or we're both screwed, Kadir. I'll lose my job, you'll go back to prison... Prison? Of course. If your contract ends, your parole is over. They'll send you back. But don't remind me of such bad things. Come on, Kadir, you're my man. Veli? Veli! Veli! Hurry! Run, run! Veli? Veli! Veli! Veli! - Ferhat! - Kadir! - You left the coffeehouse early? - No one's there anyway. Ferhat, Ali hasn't shown his face in a while. I didn't see him for a few days. Meral neither. Did you see Veli? I haven't seen him for 20 years, but I recognized him. - Who? - Veli, our middle brother. Middle brother? Ferhat... You tricked me well. But only so far. You're out of steam now. But I didn't know Veli was involved in this, too. Kadir, what are you talking about? You played with me, like a cat with a mouse. Shame on you! But you won't take my Ahmet. I won't give you my Ahmet. Well, enough said. I know where Meral is hiding. I'll give you two hours. If you let Ahmet go, I won't call the police. If Ahmet isn't returned, I'll destroy you all. That's it? What do you mean, that's it? Everything's obvious. They're hiding in the neighborhood, keeping Ahmet hostage. I'm telling you, Veli is involved. Stop, stop, stop. Tell me slowly. Meral didn't leave. She's hiding in Ahmet's house. They're holding Ahmet hostage. Go and look. Weird sounds come from inside. I ring, no one opens. They have cuffed Ahmet. Mr. Hamza, we must hurry. I told them, if they release Ahmet, I won't go to the police. - You said what, to whom? - To Ferhat. - Who is Ferhat? - One of them. I told him that if they let Ahmet go, I won't say anything. You fucked up. Is there anyone in that house now? That's why you must hurry. To barricade the house. Then storm in after Ahmet is released. Are you telling us how to do our job? That's not what I meant. Please don't misunderstand. Don't raid the house with Ahmet there. What raid? There's nothing there, man. My God. Mr. Hamza, will you send a police patrol? Police, open up. Police, open up. Get back. - Entry prohibited. - Sir, please. - Go back. - What happened? Tell me. What happened? - A clash with the terrorists. - Terrorists? My Ahmet? Who's that? Is it Meral? Is it Meral? Who's that? "Terrorist killed in raid!" Yes Kadir? I asked you not to raid the house before Ahmet came out. What? Didn't I tell you not to start the raid before I gave you a sign? You bastard! How dare you question me? You sent us there! And then... Such a jerk! I curse the day I met you. You had only three pieces of evidence... You swore that they took Ahmet hostage. What else? But it's my fault because I believed an idiot like you. They left Ahmet at the house and escaped. They set up a trap for us. Shut up! I curse the day I met you. Your brother was as idiot as you. Sir, don't speak bad about the dead! Shut up! Didn't you get enough of a whipping? Get up! Fuck off now! Pray to God that I don't send you back to prison. You stupid ass! My condolences. My condolences. Come this way.
