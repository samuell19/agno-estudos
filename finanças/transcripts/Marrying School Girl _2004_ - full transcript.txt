Project : Kim Yongtae / Kim Jinhong Supervising Producer : Kim Jinhong This movie is based on a part of a history book on three ancient kingdoms. It's about Princess Pyongang, daughter of King Pyongwon, and General Ondal. Believe it or not... What? What are you talking about? You can't marry the fool, Ondal! But you told me to marry him whenever I cried. Why don't you just say yes? No! Never! Dad! No! Never! Ever! Over my dead body! Shhh! Be quiet! A ghost is haunting her! What? My god says that. A ghost! What's the name? Kang Mal-hee. I said her name! Not yours! -Pyongang, An Pyongang. -An Pyongang? Okay. That's why the ghost of Princess Pyongang is haunting her. What? Princess Pyongang? You know the princess married Ondal. She had to part from her husband. She is still looking for Ondal. Your daughter has to marry before 16. Or, she will die! Is he a psychic or just a psycho? Let's go, honey. She beat me up! Ghost of Princess Pyongang is haunting your daughter! Sweety, if you keep on crying, you have to marry Ondal. Then what shall I do? Can we use a charm or an amulet? Or, exorcism? They will not work at all. Find Ondal and make your daughter marry him before she turns 16. And she has to bear a baby in a year. But why sixteen? It's too early! She will be only 10th grade! I can't do that! Princess Pyongang married at sixteen. Why not your daughter? They didn't have a formal wedding but Pyongang moved out to live with Ondal. Don't forget the baby. Within a year! Otherwise, she will die! I think you will die first! Is she a wife or something of the stupid psychi? Honey! Marrying High School Girl Dad! Well. Dad! Dad! Where's my lucky ''rain'' card? Dad!!! You really startled me! My heart almost stopped! I called you three times! Why? Don't cry. Or I will marry you off to that stupid Ondal. Dad, are you sure I will not die after I turn 16? Oh, now I got my lucky card! What a heavy rain today... You! Where are you going? It's raining outside! I'm going to buy a pen. Yeah. Then buy some meat on your way home. Let's have pan fried meat for dinner! Pyongang! Pyongang! Get the money! Why? For the meat I said! I'm not going for a pen. Anyway, thanks. You! Stop! Pyongang! I told you to stop! Mom! Mom! You stop there! No way! I told you! Stop there! What are you doing? Honey, please, please! Please!! I told you to stop playing these damn cards! I hate it! And I told you to mend the roof! I'm not a Little Mermaid. I can't sleep in the water! What a good husband! You! It really kills me! Honey! Darling, your knee hurts you? Well, our daughter isn't at home... Why don't we take the chance. Do you carry balloons with you? What if I pop this? Look at these silly hairpins! There are balloons in her shirts! And big balls in her skirt! So fat...! Please don't do that... You have a boyfriend? With that ugly face? You go to Kokuryo High School? Is that right? Only ugly and fat girls go there. At my school, Malgal High School... Girls are anyway, I'd rather kill myself if I were that ugly. Look at her! So cute! What an ugly watch... Hey! Hey... Wonderful! So cute! I really like her! She is cheeky but pretty. Where are you going late at night? She kicked me in the groin! Groin? What? Groin? You want to get hurt? Hey! Beat her up! It hurts! It's broken! You'd better lose your seeds, losers. Oh god...Wake up! I'm all wet to the skin! My Little Mermaid, I'm really tired. I told you to get up! Wake up! Now! I see, I see. It's my biggest mistake to marry you! I did serve you! I did! Serve what? Oh that reminds me of... You go and buy some meat! You want me to beat you? No, of course. Calm down please, darling. I'm going out. Your money is all too wet. Just go! I told you! Hyesuk, stop playing the game and search the name, Ondal. Again, your same old story. Recently I weep or cry so often. And I was almost killed today! Really? A big tire and truck narrowly missed me. And I got a sudden shower of water! That's scary. Maybe the psychic was right. What's you mom says? She says that's all lie. Doctors say I'm okay. But still I'm so worried. Worried? You the brave girl? Do we have to find Ondal? How can we find him? What if he is really stupid? Hey! I didn't... She didn't really mean it. She just... Give me tissue. Tears began to well up again. Tissue? Yusun! Here you are! How come he refused me? Is he that great? Hey, get the damn meal! I'm a grown-up! Don't be so rude at me! Grown up? That's not enough. You're old! Far too old! What? Forget it if you don't want to eat! Anyway, where's Pyongang? It's already mealtime and she does not show up. Hey, you old girl! Take your damn meal! You really get on my nerve! Are you that great enough to refuse me? Are you? Pyongang, Pyongang...Be careful! Dahee! You, this ungrateful child! Mom, you did see it! I was almost killed! Mom! That just fell off on me! Mom! Ah....! What's she doing here? Given the iron stick she's holding, she want to get struck by a thunder. Wait, she's Na Kongju, she's in our class. Kong-ju? You know the girl everyone hates. So who's she? A model student, top of our class! Na Kong-ju! Just leave me alone! I guess she will be a barbeque or a roast chicken. Barbeque or a roast chicken... Barbeque or a roast chicken... That's the question... Give it to me. I'd better die now. We'd better talk downstairs. Come on, please... Please, let us have a talk first. Come here, please What are you doing here? I'll die, now! Maybe a chicken. Anyway, poor teachers! She really wants to die? Hey, Pyongang! -Big news! -About what? -A new... -Teacher's coming! Be quiet! A new student transferred to our school. He is very smart, so I want you to study hard with him! Say hello to them. Hi, I'm Park Ondal. Nice to meet you. Now we finally meet real Ondal! Okay, stop. Be quiet. Let's see. Is there any empty seat? Here! Empty! Hey! Come back! Stop! No more fun now. He's going to put me in troubles. Shut up! Please, that's enough. Ondal, sit over there next to Yusun. I hope you two will study hard together! Na Kongju, come to my office after class. I'm Yu Hyesuk. Hi. I'm Jang Yusun. I'm Ahn Pyongang. We're going to visit your house after school. What do you think of it? No, my house is still messy after moving. And I never invite girls to home. You're new to the school, so you may be understand it. You know there's an old grave near our school? No, I say no! You can't get away! You're going to kill me! Stop there! Where are you going! Stop! Come on! No way! I'll get you! It's your fault! Pyongang, please... Don't leave me alone. Stop! You shouldn't have run away from us! Are you crazy? Don't hurt him! What's wrong with you? He is my life! You want me to lose my life? -Welcome, girls. -You're new friends of Ondal. Fine, thanks. Is your name Pyongang? Yes. It perfectly matches my son's name, Ondal. Thank you. I'll get some snacks for your later. Make yourself at home. Thank you. See you soon! Mom, please come back home early! Early, please! See you! Please have a seat. I go upstairs and get change. Hey, look at this! See who's Ondal's dad! You know the Ondal Furniture ad featuring a marine? He's the CEO of that company! I'm so relived! Ondal is handsome and rich as well! What if he's not real? What? What if he is not the real one. What do you mean? She's right. His name is Ondal, but it's still uncertain if he can really save you life. Yes, he is. I haven't shed a single drop of tears since I met Ondal. Still we need to be more certain because once you give everything to him and find out that he was fraud. It was too late! What do you mean by 'everything'? Make love with him! To survive, you know. Damn, this shirt is so difficult to strip off. What are you doing here? You mean girl. Against all odds, I got my, I got my lucky, lucky...card. Excuse me. Hi, may I help you? Is this Pyongang's family? Yes, you are right! I'm a friend of Pyongang. She left a school bag in my house.

No, I'm okay. 1 .5 for this and 1 .2 for this eye! But sometimes you may can't see well. And this is the time. No. She's so mean! Always tough on me! That's right! She's too violent! You're far worse than her! Don't speak ill of my friend! Shit! Anyway I have to save myself. Pyongang! Here comes Ondal! -Good morning. -Hi. Yunsun wanted to sit in my seat to get closer to the blackboard. Thank you for saving me yesterday. You! Stick your hands upright! You really drive me mad! I can't bear you anymore. But this is way too much. Shameful! You! To enter good colleges, we... What's that? What are they doing? Fanclub for Ondal. Good for you to be so popular. Anyway, study hard! See you! Hey! Everybody sits down! Yusun, take them into the classroom. Why? Hurry up! Tell them, now! Come on girls. Come in. What's this? So cute! Can I have it? Ondal! Ondal! What are you doing there! Ondal, can you leave the classroom for a minute? Why? You do want me to use violence? Shut up! From now on, Ondal is mine. What the hell! If you want to live in peace, don't dare to bother him. or you will be killed! Got it? You devil Yeah!!! Are you okay? Take your time. Pyongang, try some salad there. Thank you. Ondal, did you finish your packing? There was not much to pack, in fact. Few books and clothes. Is he going to somewhere? Yes, to America. America? Yes, his aunt is in San Francisco. Ondal will go to the U.S. to study after graduating from high school. So, he will go to the U.S. this year as an exchange student. When he will be back? Maybe next year. What? It can't be true! It can't be! Never! Pyongang! Wake up! Call 1 19! All the other people seem to have no worries. Why me! My life is all messed up! Maybe they have their own share of misfortune and bad luck. Do they? I have too much of difficulties! I met Ondal, finally, but he's going to the U.S.! How unlucky! Yes, you are unlucky. Are you pulling my legs? Now you have only 15 days left. 15 days? Actually it's 18 days, but as Ondal goes to the U.S. on 21st, you have only 15 days left before you die. You make fun of my bad luck! We are unlucky as well. We can't do anything to help you even though we know our dear friend will die soon! I guess you will die first! We have to find a solution. Find anything, or... You die! Stop saying 'die'! Wait, wait! I have a great idea! Life is full of difficulties and obstacles for me. What's this huge sound? Siren? Siren? Fire? No, not me this time! She didn't cry for a while. So I thought it was very good but... She began it again!! Not again! Too loud to bear! Stop crying! Or I'll marry you off to Ondal! I got it recorded! She might be just crazy. Okay, we taped it. Your parents agreed with your marriage. Now you have to attract Ondal. Can you win his heart? Okay, I can force him to love me! But you said you didn't like to make love with him. Do I have to do that? Do what? You have only 12 days left. Do everything you can! What? I mean I like your active attitude. But you know how to make love? What are you talking about? You know about men? About men? Yes, about men! Today, we have another new student in our class. Welcome him and get along with your new friend. Yes. I'm Roh Chilsu. Chilsu? Shit! I'm Roh Chilsu. Nice to meet you. More softly, yeah. Right. I like it. They say you almost killed a student in the last school. That's why you're kicked out of the school? No. I just wanted to study in a fresh environment. So how many times you've been kicked out? 4 or 5 times. Shit, I'm not kicked out! I see. Who's the big bro in this school? Listen! You shouldn't bother two persons in the school. The first one is Pyongang... Shit! You bumped into me! Hey, why don't you say sorry to me? You pushed me! It's not my fault. It was you who pushed me. You really get me. Whether it's you or me who first bump into, it's always you who have to be sorry for that! Chilsu! Chilsu, please stop it. Pyongang will... Shut up. Hey, you! You know who I am? You'll pay for this. Don't do that! You're so cute...So hot, baby. I never see such a beautiful baby. So pretty enough to be mine! So stupid enough to be knocked! Pyongang! It hurts you? You invite troubles, boys. It's okay. Wait for a second. Please, it's killing me. How did you get injured? I fell down on the stairs. 35, or 39? You too? We fell downstairs like this. So you must be at the bottom of the pile! Yeah. Look at this! It's all about sex. Shh! Keep quiet! Mom's downstairs! Are they all so big? Westeners' are usually big. Easterners' are not so scary. And these are the biggest ones. I can't do this! No! You want to die? No. May I remind you of your remaining days? Okay, I see. Study hard with this book not to be embarrassed when you do that. Don't worry. I saw his before. It was not that big. It'll never hurt you. Don't ignore him! Aren't you going to study this? Okay. Can I join? You turn back here. That's the point. They are more like animals! Not humans! -Yeah, like animal! -I'd be an animal. Stop crying! Or I'll marry you off to Ondal! Now you heard it. Now you have no tape, no evidence. See? Don't be silly. What? Do you think I have only one tape? What? -Honey! -Where are other tapes? Tell me! I'll find and destroy them all! Tell me where they are! Calm down! You crazy! Insane! You're losing your mind! Please! Calm down! You're going to kill our only daughter. Yeah, I'm crazy. My life is being threatened! How can I practice patience! No, I'll do anything. You believe the stupid psychic? You want to marry at 16? You're still a student! You can't marry now! I narrowly escaped from a rushing truck and horrible fire. Now I believe the psychic! I'll marry Ondal! Why couldn't I? This is not Kokuryo. Yes it was! Okay, do what you want. I don't care! I'll wait and see how happy your insane marriage will be! Go and do what you want! I'm sorry, Mom. Sorry Dad. See you. Where are you going? You can't go before you beat me. If I beat you, you have to give up. -What do you think? -I don't want to. Are you scared? Then give up! No, I won't give up. Come on! Take me on!

In reality, I beg him to marry me! It's not fair! I can't do this! Of course I like him, But it's too much for me. I don't want to be cheap! I don't like to beg him! Okay, close my eyes and push the button! Oh, no, I can't do it! Yeah. I was just about to push the button. Okay, don't mad at me! I'm just thinking! I've got crazy now! My God. What happened to you? You're all wet! My parents kicked me out. Why? Why at this late at night? I told them I'd marry Ondal. Huh! -What? Are you serious? -Huh! Uncle, I can never let him go to America. What are you talking about? I have to marry your son as soon as possible! Please! Come in. It's late at night and raining outside. Are you going to share your bed with me? In your dreams!

You can't force my son into marriage. Well... I will never go back home! It's so good for you! Happy to hear that. -You go! -No, you go! What are you doing? I'll go. Pyongang, ever since I met you, I've felt you are my destiny. I've heard about your story. The real Ondal who will save you is me! Not that boy! Get out! Look at me in my eyes! I'm so sincere! You must be insane. In fact, my name was Roh Ondal. But mom changed my name later because it sounds so old. I told you to get out. Hadn't I changed my name, you wouldn't have failed to notice me! You keep nagging me. Pyongang! I'll not let you go! Get out of my way! -Oh no! -He deserves it. Shit! Where's Ondal? You just screwed up my life! Damn, I mean you! Screwed up? What?

What's this? Hold yourself straight! I took you to the pool to provide refreshment after the exam. But you're making troubles again! Ahhh... Na Kongju, Kongju! Oh my god! How foolish! Hey you! You really want to die? You want to kill yourself? No. Then why do you attempt suicide? Nobody talks to me. Nobody cares me. Everyone hates me. I'd better die. What a good reason! I understand you, but that doesn't justify your suicide attempts. You know that it is like to live with counting your left days? I want to live! But the fear for death presses me! Come on. Pyongang. Kongju... We will be your friends. Thank you. Thank you very much. Girls... She spent quite a few days here. Her parents know that? I called them and told them not to worry. We should send her back her home! Poor Pyongang! Yeah, she really is. She's dying so young. So hot... She feels sorry for her parents to leave them. Hi, everyone. This is 'Music Box'. We want letters from you. Write us about your life. Funny, heartwarming, or love stories, and whatever... We want them all. The address is... Tell all the other students in the school to write letters, send SMS to the radio station and post the story on web boards. Understand? Yeah. You got it? I won't do that! I won't do anything that can benefit Ondal! You! You missed me! Ha! Pyongang is poor indeed. But I can't do that! Nurse teacher! Help me! Hurry up! Speed up there! Hurry up! Come on, watch the birdie! Ready... Hi! Hi! What's up! Hi, you girls. See you on Sunday morning. See you then. Don't forget it! Here comes.... Hello, yes. This is Hyesuk. I see. She is... Who's calling? Shh! Zip your mouth! Have your seat here. Why? I'm reading your letters. Today, I have a special, heart-wrenching story. -What's going on? -Shh! Yu Hyesuk, a high school student in Seoul sent this letter to us. I'm a high school student in Seoul. I wrote this for my best friend, Pyongang. She's dying now. You! She's dying from a rare disease, which hasn't been identified yet. A few days ago, she left her home. She did it for her poor parents. Her dad works at a construction site, Mom runs a mom-and-pop store. She didn't want to put burdens on them. She called me when she left home. She asked me to tell her parents that she loved them. She wanted to send this word to her aunt, an old maid over 30. I don't know where she is. It's all for you. Wait! My dear friend left home for her beloved family. She may be wandering somewhere, or lying on cold streets. She loves her family. But now she's dying young alone. Why should such a kind-hearted girl be dying so young! I hate this world! Hoping she's listening to this, I'd tell her I love her. Such a heart-wrenching story! Now Hyesuk is on the line. Hello? Hi! Did you find you friend? Yes, I did. What a relief. Where is she now? -She is... -Hey! At her boyfriend's home. Is she okay now? -Don't make any sound! -She's in critical condition. Is there any cure for her? Yes, we have one. But there's a problem. What problem? I'm her another friend. The cure is to make love with Ondal before April 23 and bear a child in a year. But Ondal doesn't want to do so even after kissing and touching her! You crazy! You spoiled it! It's okay? I'll go home tomorrow. What? You did make a good decision! Thank you for caring me. I told you she would go home. You didn't. You got it I asked for? -Here! Push the button. -Yeah. What are you doing? Bring the other one to me! It's time to go bed! You're damn stupid. Lie down on your knees! Raise a bit! Don't fart, please! Shut up! Raise your back!

It's an eternal rose that never falls. It's forever beautiful as love. Yes, beautiful. If you want to find your real love, it will appear before you someday. We're still too young. Let's wait till we grow up. Love doesn't wait! Seize the day, you know. Yeah, but...what are you doing? I'm locking up the door. What? Why? To seize the day! Stop it! No, I can't.

I won't die in a year, at least. I lost my chastity. Don't be silly. Darling. I did it for my love. I did it for my love! You know what love is? Did for what? You fool, boys. Cuckoo, cuckoo.

Fortunately, you have more time than her. See, her birthday is April 24, 6 days ahead of yours. Remember you have an advantage. Do I have to do so? Yes, it'll be all right. Excuse me, would you take picture of my family, please? Of course. Smile, go! -Thank you. -Thank you. -Can you take a picture of us? -Sure! Thank you! Your daughter is so pretty. I'd like to marry my boy off to her later. Your son is very handsome, too. He must be very clever. I want my girl to marry a boy like him. Bow twice. The bride first bows to the bridegroom.
