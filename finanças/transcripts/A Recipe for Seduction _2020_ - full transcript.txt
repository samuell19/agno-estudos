- The chicken is delicious Bunny. - Oh please, we both know I can't cook like this. It's my new chef. He's incredibly talented. - Well, you've nevertheless, orchestrated the perfect meal for the perfect evening. Right sweetheart? - Yes, it couldn't be more perfect. - Well, that's where I beg to differ. Jessica. Sweetheart. I am madly, wildly certifiably, insanely in love with you. Would you do me the greatest honor - Oh my God. - And, marry me. - Billy, I'm speechless. - Well, when you get your speech back a yes would be nice. - Why are you putting me in a spot like this. - I'm sorry? - Jessica what are you doing? - I'm sorry everyone I just... I need some time to think. - She has probably had too much wine. - Morning. - How dare you, leave Billy in the lurch like that. - Mom please. - He's a Garibaldi. - Do you know what this marriage would mean for us? - I need time to process, Okay. I'm not sure Billy is the one. - You have the rest of your lives to become soulmate. In the meantime, your father left us nothing but a legacy of debt. We're weeks away from the bank, repossessing our house. - But it's so unfair. Our families livelihoods shouldn't depend on who I choose to marry. - I'm sorry, Jessica. Marrying Billy is the only thing that can save us. - Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt. The menu for the Christmas Eve luncheon is very for you to look at Mrs Mancera. - Sorry, who are you? - Harland Sanders, the new cook. - Oh, don't be so modest. Harland was head chef at Le Petit Pamplemousse. - Oh my gosh. We've been trying to get a reservation there for years. Well, I insisted Harland get out of the city for a while, come stay in the guest house as our resident chef, if he will. - Anyway, I better get back to work. It was nice meeting you, - Jessica. - Jessica. - Yeah, this is good. - Nice, thank you. - All right, I'll take that. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Nobody's offered you a tour of the property yet, have they? - No, not yet. Thank you. Shall we? Well, that explains why your mom was so upset yesterday. - Yeah, she can't see past Billy's wealth or who he really is. - Really. - For starters, he's an egotistical entitled little... Oh, I don't know why I'm telling you this. I'm hijacking our whole conversation. Tell me about you. The Harland Sanders story. - Well, I'd like to think it hasn't been fully written just yet, but if I were the author of it, I'd have a chapter in there about my secret recipe, changing the world. - Oh, secret recipe, how mysterious. - And then what? What's the next chapter about? - First, you don't answer my proposal and now you're not answering my calls. - Sorry Billy, I just need some time. - You humiliated me, rejecting me in front of my parents. - Oh, take it easy - Who the hell are you? - Harland Sanders, the new chef. - Beat it crouton, get back to the kitchen and let me and my fiance... - Billy stop. - Jessica, you know we're meant to be together. Don't turn this into the biggest mistake of your life. - Don't call me crouton. - What's up? I'm about to go on a date with that guy I met at the farmer's market. - Oh right, I forgot about that. - Yeah, we're meeting at his country club. I'm literally sitting in my car right now and trying to get country club ready. So, did you decide what you want to do about Billy? - No, not yet. Wanna hear something crazy? I think I'm falling for the new chef Harland. - ooh. - We have this connection. I can't explain it. He's so compassionate and handsome and ambitious. He told me he has a secret recipe that's gonna change the world. And you knows something, I believe in him. - Damn, I don't think I've ever heard you this happy. - I know, but what do I do? My mom needs me to marry Billy. I've seen the bills Lee. It's really bad. And what should I do? Should I leave Billy for Harland? - Well, the heart wants what it wants Jess, but listen, I gotta run to this date. I will talk to you later and tell you all the deeds. - Have a great day. I'm wanna hop in the shower. - Love you, mwah. - Bonnie, is Jessica with you? - No, she doesn't know I'm here. I have some troubling news. Jessica is falling for Harland Sanders of all people. - Harland. The cook. You still are crazy bunster, I'll give you that. - I'm serious Billy. I heard Jessica going on about him, like a school girl in love. And if that isn't absurd enough, Harland claims to have some secret recipe, that'll make him a man of great repute. - A secret recipe, Spare me. - We all have our secrets, Billy. You remember our long weekend in the vineyard? - How could I forget. - If you marry my daughter, I promise there'll be more long weekends in your future. As many as you want - I'll take care of this. Knock, knock, anyone home? Secrets out chicken man. - You can save yourself the trouble Billy, Jessica is it here. - No no see, you're just the one I'm looking for. - Oh, all right. What about? - I've come to make you an offer. - Sorry? - You're gonna make me explain this aren't you? How much to leave Jessica alone and skip town. - Sorry pal I'm not interested in your money. Oh, that's right, I forgot you don't need money. You have a life-changing secret secret recipe. Oh, come on. Where's your sense of humor? Let me guess you're upset because she said yes. - Oh no. She didn't tell you. Did she? Do yourself a favor pal. Take the check and get lost. Merry Christmas. - Where's Jessica? - Please, so nice to see you. - Jessica. Jessica. - I'm afraid she's just run out to get a new phone. Seems she lost hers, so strange. Something I can help you with? - I saw you and Billy at the club, you had your hands all over him. - That's ridiculous. Billy was rightfully upset about the botched proposal. I was merely consoling him. - I know what I saw, and I'm telling Jessica. Jessica. Jessica. - Lee it's me again, I haven't had a phone for a day, so I don't know if you've been trying to reach me. Anyway, call me when you got this. Hey, I was just thinking about you. - Look, I know you already made up your mind, but I'd appreciate it If you told your fiance, I can't be bought off. - What is this? - Where did you get this? - And my plan, my secret recipe, that I'm supposed to stay between us. - I never told him about that. Harland what's going on? - Never mind, I'm sorry. I shouldn't be bothering you with this. I hope you and your fiance are happy. - Harland Wait, stop. What are you talking about? I never said yes. I don't want Billy. I want you. - Billy, we have a problem. - Mom, I have to tell you something. - Oh? - I can't marry Billy. I was talking to Harland last night and.. - Harland? - Yes, Harland. Is the thought of me with someone that makes me happy so awful to you? - No, no. It's just Harland left dear. He's gone. - What do you mean he is gone? - Late last night in a hurry It seemed. I thought you knew. - Hello? Harland. Billy what the hell are you doing? - Getting rid of this low life. He's ruining everything. - Billy - Thank God. Billy has gone crazy Lee's escaped. - What do you mean Lee's escaped? - Just kill him already. - Mom? - You should have accepted my offer and get lost when you had the chance. - Billy stop. Billy stop. - This is all your fault. - Are you okay? - Harland. - To the next chapter. - Harland Sanders, you may now kiss the bride. - You have a visitor today Mrs. Mancera. - Hello Bunny. - Well? - I found them.
