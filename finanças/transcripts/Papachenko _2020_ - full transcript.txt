I've got so many memories from this gym. And all of them are good ones. This is where it all started. This is where I worked so hard. This is where I spent many hours, many days. On these stairs, it was always packed. Guys came, and everyone changed on the stairs because the benches had no room for everyone. In those two square meters, there wasn't room for all of us. Lots of people and everyone changed on the stairs. It’s all permeated not only with Vasiliy’s sweat. So many students passed through this place... It all started in this basement. There was no proper ventilation, everyone was pouring, you couldn't breathe, but they kept working. But I say it's a boxing Mecca. I work at a school, and I tell children: "You should know that it's a boxing Mecca. This is where Vasiliy and Anatoliy worked, and their aura is still there”. One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ninety! It’s great! This is where I set plenty of my personal records. It’s all recorded, we’ve got video. Including the famous 250th pull-up on this bar. I come in and see that Vasya is doing pull-ups. I say, “Vasya, how many pull-ups do you do?" I think it was 40 or 50, but that isn't important. He's pulling up but cannot go all the way, and he says, "Dad, I can't do it!" Anatoliy Nikolayevich says, “No questions, get back down. In that case, it’s not going to work.” And Vasya is in tears and keeps pulling up. I thought to myself that I would never have been able to do that. That was his father, but it was already evident what path he was directing him to. I asked him, which is better to win, what is more prestigious: The World Championship or the Olympic Games? I remember it as if it were just a moment ago. We were going up the stairs from the basement. And he explained to me that the Olympics are held every four years and that is the most prestigious competition. The Olympic champion stays in history. It's the top. It's the highest peak that one can climb in sports. And after that, I told him that I was going to be an Olympic champion. It was their common dream. Back then, it seemed, such an unrealistic one. Because the boy who dreamed of Olympic gold was barely acquainted with boxing. And his father was a claimant of a Master of Sports title, a children sports trainer from a small town of Belgorod-Dnestrovskiy. This is Lomachenko's home town. From here Anatoliy Nikolayevich went to do his military service where he started boxing. This is where he returned to after he got married and graduated from the Institute of Pedagogy. He became a father: first, his son was born, then the daughter. He taught physical culture at a school. Also, he held an extracurricular boxing class at the school gym, which Vasiliy attended as well. Soon enough, the trainer and the young boxers moved from the school basement to much more convenient premises - the gym of the Akkerman boxing club. This name became world-famous due to the Lomachenko father and his son. They progressed together and grew in sync. One - as a boxer, the other - as a trainer. Their tandem soon became well-known in Ukraine. And after that ― in the world. Because Lomachenko won against each and every one. As an amateur, he held around four hundred fights and accepted defeat only once! Vasiliy is referred to as one of the strongest and most technical fighters in the history of boxing. He won European and world championships. He even exceeded his old dream by winning the Olympic gold twice. Together they went into professional boxing. In this status, Vasiliy keeps conquering the champion's belts and setting new records. He is recognized as the best professional boxer in the world. And Anatoliy Nikolayevich - as the best trainer. So, now two people with the Lomachenko name are written into the history of boxing, both amateur and professional. Keep going, keep going! Like that, stretch it! Just like that! Good job! Do it! Pull! Stomach! Stomach! Stomach! No sleeping, no sleeping! Stretch it! Arena: Vasya! Vasya! Another victory and another record. Another ovation from the filled to the brink boxing arena - one of the largest in the world. A transition to pro turned into a fiasco for many a distinguished amateur boxer... but the Lomachenko pair continued to dominate completely in the new status. Whoa! Vasiliy boxed for all the age groups in the Ukrainian national team... Vasya, the one in the front! And his father was with him in all the camps and all the fights. Usually, next to the head trainer of the team. Watch it! Like that, good! Turn him around! Three! Three hits! - Hit! - Stretch! Stretch! Just like that, good! Lomachenko has never been a head trainer of a national team. Perhaps, if he'd wished to, he might have been the head of the head team. He worked not only with his son but with several other boxers, who were drawn to him by the force of Vasiliy's achievements. The victory goes to Vasyl Lomachenko, Ukraine! In clubs and in gyms, when people talked about fighters who show extraordinary results for their age, you could hear, "Lom, Lom, Lomachenko.” Where is he from? Belgorod-Dnestrovskiy. Who is training him? His dad is his trainer. No doubt, Vasya is the engine of this whole team. I doubt that Vasya looked up to any of us. We were all probably looking up to him. Because they train through some inhuman workload. At that moment, it seemed to be something from the fantastic realm. But when you see that someone is capable of doing that, you yourself find motivation. You push yourself. Maybe none of us could do what Vasya did. But, at least, we tried. And we’ve all improved our results. Everything happened exclusively in an autonomous mode. “You’re big guys. Do you want gold? Then you'll need to work hard!” If you’re wishy-washy - then you might work or you might not, and that’s what you get in the end. Everyone worked extra hard - we swam and ran. Vasiliy and I ran 42 kilometers. Olexandr Gvozdyk came to our camp in Koncha-Zaspa and ran 42 kilometers on his own. Anatoliy Nikolayevich drove by him in a car. As a professional, Vasiliy does not train in a team anymore. He prepares for every fight by an individually-tailored curriculum. But other boxers always work by his side. Some ― regularly, some ― sporadically. Anatoliy Lomachenko never denies help to any of them. Working with other boxers, Anatoliy Nikolayevich structures the class in away that not only promotes their physical fitness but always includes a competitive element. Head and knees! Sanya is a live wire. Lets go, Alex! Last round! I think he's a leader from the inside out. And he's not a person of two minds. He might not say something outright. But I think he's a single-minded person. He can persuade you. He can get the message across in a way that leaves no doubt. I feel great respect toward him. Because he took me and turned me around as a boxer. Sometimes I don’t entirely agree with what Anatoliy Nikolayevich says. But later it often turns out that I really had to do exactly what he’d said. He’d say: “Hit the right punch from the bottom." And you think that this punch won't pass, it won't come through. But if he says so, it will go right through. That's the way it is. That's what happens when you trust a person. And considering his results with Vasya, and what he achieved with our other teams, with our WSB team, there are all the right reasons to trust him. After the Olympics, Anatoliy Nikolayevich gave an interview. He was asked somewhere at the airport, and he replied, “If the trainer says you need to hit your head against the wall, you must hit your head against the wall!” And that phrase made the headlines. At first, you don’t get it. What kind of trainer is it that tells you to beat your head against the wall? It seems anti-pedagogical. But in reality, the meaning is different. If I ask you to do something potentially risky, and we agreed that you trust me, that's what you must do. That’s what it looked like. You need to do 70 pull-ups today. So, you do them until you hit 50-55, you’re so tired you can’t go on. You can’t go on ― okay, then stop. He'd never say he's tired. We might complain, and I tell him about it, he'd say, "Yeah, that happens." But he'd never say, "Oh, poor you." That was the way he was brought up - nobody pitied him. And he doesn’t pity anyone. You want it ― do it. You don’t want it ― don’t do it. That’s your right. He says, “If you don’t want to do it, you don’t have to. You can skip it.” Skip it? Yes, based on how you’re feeling. I don’t know how it happens. But there hasn’t been a single time that I gave up after I said I couldn't do it anymore. He says, "There is no 'cannot, ' only 'don't want to.'" - That's it. - All done? Give me three more passes. "There is no such thing as ‘I can't.' There's only ‘I don't want to.' If you want to, you can do anything at all times." That is how Lomachenko Sr. Brought up his son. Vasiliy named his son after his father. Anatoliy. And Tolik also learns Grandpa's lessons from the earliest childhood. Get up! Well done. Two! Come on, come on. Whoa, three! Come on! Five! Come on! Six! Great job! That’s it? Oh, you can do more? Come on! Seven! Well done! Whoa! Eight! Can you do one more time? Just the last one, the final one. Na, he didn’t... he did! Wonderful! Can you do one more? Just one? Come on, just one and you’re free. Do it! Great job! Lomachenko, the trainer, taught Vasiliy from the early days to be the winner. The father taught his son to be human. Always. Victories are great. But they are not primary. If I was guilty of something... The first time he warned me: "I'm not going to raise my hand on you. I'm not going to beat you with a belt. But for every wrongdoing, you will learn a poem by heart. Any one you want. Take any book, open it, choose a page, a poem, and learn it. Get it?” I said, yes, I get it. But in just a few days I had to face the music. I used a bad word somewhere. Either he heard it himself, or someone told him. “Come here! We agreed?” Agreed. “It happened?” It happened. “Choose your poem!” I chose Alexander Pushkin’s poem and started drilling it. The boys came all day long and asked me whether I was going out. I said, sorry guys, I can’t, I need to learn a poem. A father and a trainer. But also - a teacher and a mentor. Anatoliy Lomachenko did not only teach Vasiliy boxing. As well as sporting experience, he also passed his life experience to his son. He has always done it as tactfully as when talking on sports topics. He never demanded but advised. He was never stubborn but persuasive - since he always said the right things. More than a boxer - even an Olympic champion - Anatoliy wanted to bring his son up to be a real man and a decent person. The Black Sea is twenty kilometers from home. And the Dniester estuary is even nearby. These are the beaches where Anatoliy Lomachenko would bring Vasily in his childhood not to swim and sunbathe however. But work hard, training in the sand. So look, you need to make two passes about thirty seconds each. Temp - just above average. Not rushing, but going smoothly. Proper wide steps, got it? Those umbrellas over there, by the fence ― that’s where you start. Gesture when you’re ready. I will gesture back at you. Then you start and I keep the time. So let’s get this rolling... And how will I understand when it’s been 30 already? I’m telling you it’s gonna be roughly that. Hey, it was a joke! Hey! What gives? Come on, stop. Let’s do this! Stand on your palms, then try to switch to the fists. Keep your weight on one hand while you switch with the other. Come on. Try it. - Yup. Feeling all right? - Yeah! Stand on your fingers. Now on your fists again. Push-up. Back on your fingers. Give me ten. - Do two passes like this. - Two? Just mind this: first you switch between fingers and fists five times. You do one pushup on your fists, then one on your fingers. - One more. - I did two! - You made the switch. - I did ten push-ups! - One on your fingers, one on your fists. - And so you repeat ten times. You’re doing it wrong. You need to throw it first, so he runs, and then you start, otherwise he... That’s the best way to do it, you see why? Here it comes! Making a pass! Fire in the hole! There you go, there you go! Good! - Score? Three-Three? - Four-Four. - Out! - No! Anatoliy Lomachenko taught not only boxing to his son. Wrestling, rowing, acrobatics, tennis, athletic marathon, swimming across the estuary. Also, team sports: hockey, basketball, volleyball. Even before Vasiliy became a champion, his father turned him into a real athlete. They both feel confident on most sportive grounds. And Anatoliy organizes and is an active participant of every competition that Lomachenkos regularly hold among their team and friends. That only confirms that another person would say, “Why are you telling me this? Can you do it on your own?” He can do everything on his own. Good! He plays with us. He does everything better, for sure. When we boxed as amateurs, he trained every day with us. He went for runs. - I thought that the way he played tennis. - He could have won against Nadal. Tennis for sure. As a rule, Lomachenkos play against each other. For Vasiliy, it's a real competition because he strives to win at everything. But Anatoliy Nikolayevich trains even as he plays. In most games that we play, be it volleyball or tennis, he sometimes goes easy on us. When Vasya notices that, he gets nervous, starts yelling, and does the same. But that's the way Anatoliy Nikolayevich maintains the microclimate in the team. When he sees that it’s unnecessary, he, on the contrary, plays in a way that keeps you on your toes even more. Out! It is 0-7! Well done! Look what he's doing! - Six - Three! - Five - Four! We may be losing by five points, and he’s adding those points to our score! I ask Anatoliy Nikolayevich, how did that happen? Aren’t we five points down? He says I’ve counted wrong and we’re five points up. So, at some point, Andrey Borisovich suggested that I just play without keeping count of the score. And I decided to play that way, and then he tells us the score. Agree? Agree. Good job! Well done! Five-Four. Thought you weren’t gonna do it. - Everyone is waiting for you! - It’s time? - Yes. Been time for a while, son. - Let’s go! - No sleeping on the job! - Yeah! No sleeping! Enough! - Didn’t see that one coming? - Nope. We haven’t been over that during trainings. I’ve been saving that up for the camera. Dad, get it together! That’s not what we agreed on! Good job tying these. - Who tied them? - You hit so hard the gloves are breaking. I’ll show you later how Mayweather works with the boxing pads. In a pro category, Lomachenkos set the most ambitious goals at the outset - and set out to achieve them at once. Titles, earnings, and fame - these are important, of course. But their main desire and impetus is to write their name into the history of professional boxing. Come on, Dad! Vasiliy became World Champion in his third fight. In the seventh fight, he established a record in the number of fights it took him to earn the titles from two different categories. He defended the champion's title by destroying his opponents. Four elite boxers in a row admitted defeat prematurely in their matches with Vasiliy. He received a nickname "No Mas." In Spanish, this means "enough," "no more." Soon enough, Vasiliy won a title in the next weight category and set another record. It only took him twelve fights to become a champion in three different categories. Two Lomachenkos: a father and a son. Now both of them are famous. And, it seems, are equally popular. Lomachenko’ fans: Loma! Loma! - Lomachenko’ fans: Dyadya Tolya! - Dyadya Tolya!! Lomachenko’ fans: Dyadya Tolya! Dyadya Tolya! A pro boxer must have a nickname. Vasiliy transferred to pro with the one he had as an amateur. "High-tech." Figuratively, a boxer who is ahead of his time. A new nickname was even more ambitious in meaning. "Matrix." A hint that its holder fights on a fantastical level! This is how Vasiliy is called by journalists when they describe his technique, speed, or another victory. "No Mas." This nickname stuck to Vasiliy after four boxers in a row gave up in a fight with him. But it did not become primary. Who would like to be called "enough"? There were other options, but in the end, Vasiliy decided to stick to the one his supporters gave him. To the word that the arena chants during the fight. Laconic, loud, and severe, and now also recognizable across the globe. LOMA. Camera Papachenko! Okay, Team Loma, let's go! The transformation of the last name gave a nickname to Anatoliy Nikolayevich as well. In the end ― five dropped letters from the son's name. And it begins with a word that is so important to Vasiliy. It turned out soulful and so precise. PAPA-CHENKO. I told them to give me that one. Let's hang it here. No, we’ll put it over there, because that’s what I usually work with. - All right, put the big one over there. - Yes, sure. Vasliliy's professional career is developing in a way that both he and his father have to spend more and more time in the USA. And the issue with the training conditions has arisen. At first, Lomachenkos went to a common boxing gym. They spent a couple of hours every day commuting, remembering the Belgorod-Dnestrovskiy Akkerman. And then ― they recreated their native gym. It is virtually identical, just a little smaller. A small Akkerman. - Maybe higher? - Let’s see. They’re gonna let go now. - Higher? - Nah, I think that’s enough. That’s enough. But they are still more comfortable in the real Akkerman. Lomachenkos set up the gym with special feelings. This is the place where they prepared to most of their victories... Okay, observe! And this is where they lived through the hardest times of their work together. - Maybe the other way around? - The big carbiner goes on top. - Am I on time? - Just on time! So I felt. Here I come. - Maybe even higher? - Dunno, I think it’s enough. - Let’s do one link higher. - One link higher. Let’s go. Put it down? Nah, it’s okay. We’ll hold it, easier that way. I’m holding it, you’re holding onto it. - I’m assisting. - So I see. Now we’re talking! Now it’s my height. Whole two centimeters, a world of difference! Thanks, Alex! At the beginning of his professional career, there was an episode when Vasya said, he thought something was unnecessary to do. And in the end, the trainer agreed. If you consider that unnecessary, do what you feel is right. The camp is almost done. Everyone's at the end of the rope. No nerves, no strength left, all that. Vasiliy Anatolievich is a temperamental person. Sometimes he says something to his father. Anatoliy Nikolayevich always responds calmly, "You don't want it, don't do it. If you know all that you need to do." Yes, I won't do it! - Says Vasiliy and leaves. I say, “Vasiliy, what’s up with you, it was all well. Why don’t you just do it?” He says, have you done it? You go do it! I say, I did it, and you should do it, maybe later. He says, I won’t do it! Vasiliy Anatolievich, as usual, yelled a bit, grumbled a bit. It seemed to me that I knew more than he did. And we started having confrontations on that ground. He tells me to do something, and I think otherwise. He says, “No question, you know everything, you train yourself.” That’s it. And when I started training myself, I realized that I knew nothing. Neither how to train, nor how to reach the peak of my fitness form. Until the moment when everything went back to normal, it was your responsibility, I will do what I’ve planned. It took some time. That time wasn’t wasted, but a constructive conflict took place. Since that time, I cannot remember any serious issues. There are everyday incidents, but we only laugh at them. As a rule, Lomachenko's preparation for the fight lasts for the standard three months, which are divided into two equal parts of physical training and sparrings. But sometimes, Anatoliy Nikolayevich makes changes to the schedule. For instance, if the date of the match has been moved. In contents, his camp is always different from what other boxers do. The spars, for example, can last for up to fifteen rounds. Who knows if Vasiliy works longer or harder than other boxers. But he surely works in a particular way. Physically exhausted. Mentally emptied out. During the training camp, Vasiliy works on the edge of human capacity. Possibly, even beyond the edge. He happens to be irritated. But he and his father are the closest people in the world. In the end, they always agree, and the workouts continue according to the plan of Lomachenko Senior. There are moments sometimes when we analyze: what’s going to happen when Vasya has to do this? We know how he treats new routines, so we know what we can come up against. Anatoliy Nikolayevich tells Vasiliy to do something. And Vasiliy keeps walking around the gym, telling a story or something like that. So, he says to me, "Look, now he's going to grumble for a while, and then he's going to come back and do it." Again, there are nuances. Then when he's done it, he turns and says, "Happy now? I did it." He replies, "Yes, I'm happy. You're free to go now." We sometimes predict his reaction very precisely. How he’s going to react, and we laugh. Then, when we say it to him, he says exactly the same. And we’re like ― ha, ha! And he’s like ― what’s up with you? I ask him, why are you grumbling? He says, well, I just grumble. We just joke about it among ourselves. But Vasiliy Anatolievich is the way he is. If he were different, he wouldn’t be the Lomachenko that everyone knows so well. After the workout, Vasiliy goes to get some rest. But Anatoliy Nikolayevich continues to work. He would make corrections into the training schedule, if necessary. Analyze the video. And definitely come up with something new. Vasiliy's father does not work in boxing. He lives boxing. He teaches and learns. He improves his athlete and improves as a trainer. Their tandem is a tandem of two outstanding professionals. And when Vasiliy goes to get some relaxation, Anatoliy Nikolayevich will analyze the video of the latest workout. Because he is the one who determines what Vasiliy is going to do the next day. If the trainer says that something has to be done in a certain way, for example, you have to run fast, and then slowly, then slowly again, and then fast again. Or, for instance, at five o'clock in the morning, you need to do fast training, not slow. Or, you don’t get up at five, but at six or seven. Or, after one training session, you have to do another one. Or, instead of a two-hour session, you need a three-hour one. And so on. If the trainer says so, this is what you must do, this is the direction you must take. The trust of Anatoliy Nikolayevich to his trainee and his son is the condition upon which he can step outside the boundary of his previous experience. Yes, it’s hard. You don’t know how it’s going to turn out. But if you trust me ― we’ll get there. One step outside the existing experience. And that is how it goes - every day, every hour, every minute... One step beyond the boundary. This is possible only on the condition of total trust between the trainer and the trainee. Between the father and the son. The space beyond the limit - is where both Lomachenkos step together. In professional boxing, there are victories obtained outside the ring ― but worth as much as the titles and records. Annually, the Boxing Writers Association of America determines the best of the best. These are so-called Boxing Oscars, which Lomachenko team members now regularly receive. For Vasiliy, getting various awards is a usual thing. But his father, who received the title of the World's Best Trainer twice in a row, felt ill at ease at the awards ceremony. Great thanks to everyone for acknowledging this achievement. But first of all, I’d like to express my gratitude to all the professional team that works toward a common goal. It’s our promoter Bob Arum, the manager Egis Klimas, our physical fitness trainer Cecilio, the cutman Russ, the psychologist Andrey Borisovich... And of course, the talent, that shouldn’t be impeded from realizing itself. It doesn’t need to be helped, just not impeded. On the other hand, they say, “The sportsman is the one who wins, the trainer is the one who loses.” So, in this case, what do we do? The trainer stands aside, and the sportsman wins. So, thank you for winning! I can say he's the best trainer in the world! And, of course, I'd like to believe that it's the truth. It isn't some kind of WOW for him, "I'm the best trainer in the world! And I got some award or other." The fewer people talk about him, the less they mention him, the better he likes it. He doesn’t worry about that. He doesn't think about it at all. He isn't vain, unlike me, he doesn't need it. He knows his worth, and he doesn't care who says what. Recognition or no recognition, all the regalia do not bother him at all. And he surely doesn't chase them, unlike me. He doesn’t like that. But I will keep talking about it because he’s done so much good, and I will talk about it. He may not talk about it, but I will. Olexandr Usyk! It was Anatoliy Nikolayevich who accompanied Usyk on his first fight as a pro. He wanted to keep working with Olexandr but couldn't train him full-time and on a regular basis. Lomachenko focused on working with his son. Vasiliy and Olexandr often prepared for their respective fights simultaneously on different points of the planet. Usyk was, for a long time, both successful and comfortable working with his American trainer. But Lomachenko was still an unofficial mentor, and the principal authority to him - Anatoliy Nikolayevich stayed in Olexandr's team, always helped with timely advice... and always rooted for Usyk as if he were his own son. Both Vasiliy and his father were one step away from the ring during Olexandr's first championship match. Three, Alex! Circle around! From the right! Left, then punish him! Sock him from the right, come on! Right-Left-Right! Three! Three! Come on, come on! In the autumn of 2016, Usyk became World Champion. After that, he has successfully defended his title. The opposition was growing stronger, while the trainer situation - if not exactly worse, then definitely more complicated and confusing. In the first three matches after the title fight, three different mentors stood in Olexandrs' corner. He kept looking for the best one for himself. Even knowing that it was useless. An American trainer was replaced by another American, then a Ukrainian one. But not with the last name that Usyk dreamed of. Anatoliy Lomachenko still attended Olexandr's fights and supported him morally and by giving advice. While the boxer kept searching for the best mentor, knowing that he was very close to the right one. In the meantime, there was a new challenge in store for Usyk, the biggest in his career. In case of his winning the world boxing super series, he would have become the absolute world champion. He had three matches to win. But all the opponents were exclusively elite. Usyk went into the final fight, but the semi-final was extremely tough. The experts said - specifically because of the trainer. The clock was ticking. The boxer realized that things had to change - immediately. He wanted to be trained by Lomachenko. And he knew the other one wouldn't mind anymore. When Usyk voiced his request, the trainer was ready for it. It happened at Istanbul airport. By that moment, when he only opened his mouth when the offer was voiced, We knew when and where we were going and had already planned out our work. The only thing - did he talk with you? No. Neither did he talk with me. And after that happened, we agreed to meet in a week. When I came to see him in Belgorod-Dnestrovskiy, he was very precise as for the place where we would train. Said that we needed a fully private training base. We prepared there in a completely private mode. The self-dedication mode is tough to get used to. Because you keep adding on, you keep doing what you've never done before. Why does one need to do that? If you don't push your nervous system to adapt to more, you aren't allowing yourself to go beyond the limit. Your unconscious won't let you go there, it will say "no." By pushing that limit, you get permission - we're going to go this far, we're going to push a little further. The first month of the training session was extremely hard. He had a hard time coping. It was extreme. It was very much like what Vasya does now. And it’s different from what we did on the amateur level. I saw what Sanya did. It was hell, that’s how I’d put it. Luckily, Sanya has a special quality. Even if he's "dying," quote-unquote, at work, he accepts it personally - as a challenge. There were situations when we said to Sanya - that’s it, let’s do it tomorrow. And we always ended up finishing that “tomorrow” assignment at three o’clock in the morning. At three in the morning! At two or three in the morning, I wake up and go downstairs from the second floor. I’m surprised to see Anatoliy Nikolayevich and Andrey Borisovich sitting there playing backgammon. He asks me, "Can't sleep?" I say, "No, just going to the toilet." "Go sleep," he tells me. I went to the loo, drank some water, and went back to sleep. In the morning, I started asking questions: I went downstairs at night, and you guys weren't sleeping? He says, "Did you really?" I have no idea why they weren't sleeping at that time, playing backgammon. Moscow was chosen as the place for the final match - even though Usyk's opponent was Russian. He attended all the media events with his mentor - one of the most recognized trainers in the world, Abel Sanchez. Who was going to stand in Olexandr's corner? - It was a well-kept secret until the very fight. Before the fight, Usyk's changing room was packed. But Sanchez still managed to see his personal rival in that fight among the crowd. In the room's corner modestly stood a man whose name had already been written into the history of boxing. …still undefeated and now the undisputed cruiserweight champion of the world. Olexandr Usyk! He lives by the right values. He lives by the orthodox faith. He, in principle, keeps all the basic commandments. Maybe that’s why he became more deeply religious with age. His faith has become so strong that it might be the reason he stopped giving interviews. Yes, he’s a believer. And, in his faith, he’s directly connected to God. God cares most for what good things you’ve done to people. That’s why I think he’s directly connected to Him. Without taking into account of fights the emotions of Anatoly Lomachenko can be very rarely seeing. And when they do appear on his face, they are extremely positive. A smile or laughing. Even tears you’ve seen appeared in his eyes are of joy or fascination. When Vasiliy had his birthday, thirty years old, he took the floor, and halted a little, made a pause... It was a charged silence. If we didn’t know its contents exactly, we could all feel it. For thirty years, I have been preparing for this. God bless you, son. I didn’t see the tears. But the pause, I think, was because he choked up with them. But he, as always, stopped at exactly the right moment. Made a pause, then finished and went back to his table. Where are we here, Said? We are at Staples Center, Los Angeles. This is the locker room of the best fighter of the world Mr.Lomachenko. And we have a chance to have Mr.Philipp Plein as the guest. Thank you, guys. I so happy to be here. Look at this crocodile. Amazing. This is a unique piece. Only made for the Champ. And that’s Mr. Papachenko. The secret of all secrets. He hate to be filmed. No photo, no camera, no video. But he is Champ of the Champs. This is the man! This is the man! Right here! OK, good luck! Let's go, champ! Arena: Loma! Loma! I think, it seems to me, that his dream has come true. He has a family, he has a home, he has what he's always been talking about - an Olympic champion. I don't know. That what it looks like to me, that's my external view. What are his dreams now? It's hard to say. I don't really know. Anatoliy shares his dreams neither with his son nor with anyone else. He does not give interviews - a modest man who does not enjoy too much attention. He simply does his work - every single day. He is the best trainer on the planet. But if he had ever dreamed of it, it was at the bottom of his list. It seems he only dreams of helping others become better versions of themselves. Of making everyone around happy.
