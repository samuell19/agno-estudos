Complete Subtitles Exclusively Arranged by:- Samaksh ~ Varsha ~ Pankaj Jain They say without a shepherd the sheep die or get lost. Or the wolves attack them or they starve. Because they have no brains. Whoever doesn't have a brain needs a shepherd. A caring shepherd. A shepherd is like a father to the sheep. A man without a father is a nobody. This is our shepherd. We're all his sheep. He tells us where to go, when to go and what to do. When to sit, when to stand and when to die. I weighed 4 kilos and 300 grams. My mother tells me I was a cute baby. They were trying to have me for 7 years. They had prayed and prayed until it happened. One night I get a cramp and my mom takes me to my dad at the ER. My dad was operating on an accident victim and couldn't see me. The operation takes too long and my mom gets frustrated and decides to take me to another hospital. On the way over, she gets carjacked. They put a knife to her throat. She begs them to take the car but let her take her baby. They knock her down. She begs for help, but no one was there to help her. My mom says that the next morning all of my dad's hair had turned white. Just like that Indian movie! Does your dad do crack? What're you talking about, he's doctor! They all do smack and crack! - Who?! - The doctors! They have access to everything in their labs, everything comes from there! Well producers don't use their own products. - Why wouldn't they? - Do you? Does Shakur? Only the top-notch batch. The whole neighborhood is using, are you giving them junk? Yep. How's everyone at home? This doesn't work, you brought us your trash? That's not trash! Shahin, your Mercedes Benz isn't ready yet?! - Don't make me come! - Whatever! - I miss this neighborhood. - Miss your own neighborhood. - My hood is right here. - Your hood is way up north! A man's hood is where he grows up. Got any chicks? I'm always on duty at the prison, I got no time for chicks! You're living the life. Is everything alright at home? - I'm asking if everyone's alright? - Yes. They're fine. I can't even ask how they are? - Are you asking how my sister's doing? - Everyone at home is only your sister?! Mother's great, Granny's still alive, crawls around, pops alright, Shakur and Shahruz are well. - Anyone else? - That's all? - What's eating you? - Nothing! It worked! It worked! Thank God it worked! Thank God it worked! _ ls your pops golden like you? - Golden?! ' - Is he white and blonde like you? - My mom looks like me. - You talk pretty!

Diesel open up, open up Diesel, it's me, Shahin! - Where is he? - Upstairs. - Alive? - Yeah bro, don't panic. - What happened? - He's sleep, don't come in. Why? Diesel shut them up. Who stabbed him? He says he was playing around and it went in. - You mean his friends hit him? - That's what he says, but it's bullshit. It's not that kid's fault. - How do you know? If a knife goes in the gut it goes all the way in. Maybe it won't. It slides right in. don't argue with me! It's never a clean cut. So what then? Meaning whoever stabbed him wanted him to see blood and get scared. He knew what he was doing. - They stabbed him in the hood? You think anyone in the hood has the balls to stab this kid? The hood is out of your control, from now on expect anything to happen. Can't you keep your mouth shut? Have you been outside? The police are in every corner like flies. They just confiscated one of your cars. What that has got to do with the hood? How's that a reason to stab Shahruz? What I'm saying is you're not paying attention no more. Why don't you pay attention? How can I? You never take me seriously! What can I do for you? Some people are just not cut out for this. And you're not. You are? What're you staring at me for? Go take that kid home. - Didn't you hear me? - I want to know who stabbed him. I'll have Diesel look into it.You stay out of this. Am I Diesel's inferior?! Fuck! Stop eating my brains out! Talk talk Whatever I say you just say talk talk talk! What did I say? I'm talking to you! Why won't you answer me? - Don't get me started in front of everyone. - Go ahead, let me hear what you have to say. I'm worried about having you find him, and then pissing your pants once you do. Me pissing my pants?! Just once put me in charge of this, I'll bring him here and have him kiss your feet. I want an ear, can you give me that? An ear! I will. Give me the order. I will. Omid, bring in the kid who they say has stabbed Shahruz. No. No. I beg you. Please! don't! - You said it was his friend's fault. - What do you care? Cut his ear off. - Sir, it wasn't me, who am I to stab Shahruz? Mr. Shakur! - Give him the knife. Sir, please, forgive me, please! Work's done. Come on up. Don't cut my ear, please don't! don't! Cut it off. Sir, I beg you, it wasn't me, they're all lying, it wasn't me. Not my ear. Not my ear. Please don't cut it off. Please don't. Mr. Shahin! Mr. Shahin! Please don't. Forgive me. Go back to work. Take the kid out. Come here. Diesel open the door let him leave. Come here. Diesel open the door let him leave. What is it? - You sit your ass down like you own the place. - I'm looking at Shahruz's wound. Get out of here. Get out. - Hello auntie. - Shut the hell up. Love you too! What're you looking at? - Who stabbed this kid? - They were joking around. Joking around with a knife? Back in our day it was with stones, now it's a knife. As long as there's blood. I pray to God they hang the two of you before you make him as useless as yourselves. You watch out for your daughter, no need to worry about us. - What's wrong with my daughter? - What's not wrong with her? Watch your mouth you moron, you're talking about your sister. Does a proper girl have to dye her hair so much? Tonight a suitor is coming over, if she doesn't do it now when can she? - She can use henna instead. - Since when are you religious?! Tonight she has a suitor, what about last week? - Two nights ago it was red! - Henna is red you idiot. So you do know what she's been up to! You just look the other way! Get out of here. If you had an ounce of honor my son wouldn't be stabbed in broad daylight. If it was Shakur you would've hugged him. Let this one get married and leave before shit hits the fan. What's left to pluck at her husband's place?! She's already plucked everything! Her eyebrow is toothpick thin! You don't have to teach me manners, worry about yourself you imbecile. What's wrong with me? What's not wrong with you'? A jobless slacker. That poor Shakur, he does all the work because he's older. He's the one who doesn't give me a job. Have him give me a job. Because you're good for nothing. Samad! Son-of-a-bitch, open the door. or else I will smash the window and come in. Let's save face, don't tell them she's a hairdresser.I'm talking to you! I can't lie. You make shit up all day long, you can't lie?! Shahin, don't make me come cut you into pieces! Then I'll cancel the whole thing. No you won't! This house has elders. Your elder is here! I've been knocking all morning and you won't come out! - Give that to me. - don't! What for?! - You son-of-a-bitch! - What for?! You've screwed me over. What do you want inside of this? Shit, you see! I've been looking for this all day. Don't you think your daughter won't have anything to wear without these buttons?! What will you do with it?! He ripped it off to sell it. He couldn't rip the bottom ones! Just the top two! don't be late, we'll lose face. Tell your hoodlum sons to save face, I won't make a sound. Don't make a sound, what will you do about your looks?! Shut your mouth. Samad, you must be here at 7. Where to? Step aside, I'm going upstairs. - What's upstairs? - Step aside, I want to grab my clothes. Forget your clothes. You think you can just go upstairs? - I said I want to get my clothes. - don't hang your clothes up here. Why not? Would you like it if I washed my underwear in your room and let it dry there? Is this your room now? - You can't go to work anymore. - You're nuts. You heard me. I told Afsar to not let you go. - Do I have my own money? - What's it got to do with money? If I don't work, will you pay for my expenses? Why have you not had food on the table, clothes on your back? What's wrong? - I'm not like you. - Like what? I want to make my own money. I don't want to keep asking Shakur for money. Are you suggesting I'm constantly asking him for money? - Don't you? - None of your business. What's your problem exactly? I'm working and all my clients are women. Don't you get it? The suitor's family are religious. - Religious people don't get their hair done? - They don't want a hairdresser bride. Did they tell you that or you're making it up? Do I know them or do you? If they find out you're a hairdresser they won't take you. - To hell with it. You're almost as old as mom, you think you're young enough to wait around?! I'm only 25, How's that old? You've messed around with your face so much you look 40. How have I messed around? Who dyes her pony tail 7 colors?! It's like a catalogue, not for beauty. A catalogue is on paper, not on your hair. I can't keep showing my clients the colors on paper, it's something else when they see it on my hair. Who gave you permission to have clients to begin with? Shahin, don't start again. I'll give you money by the end of the month. - A ransom?! - As if you hate money! You will no longer work, or else I'll have Shakur come after you. I don't have the patience to fight with you. Don't give me an attitude Shohreh. Don't make me ban you from even leaving the house. When will you pay back my 1 million tomans ($250)? - Are you blackmailing me? - lf I don't work I won't have money, if I don't have money I have to collect what I'm owed. Mr. Harekat. Mr. Harekat! What? Don't you have any decency?! Zari, I will tell your brother! Stop it Shahin! If I had the money I would buy a piece of land and grow poppy seeds on it. And I would just sit there and Zari would bring me tea and dried mulberries. And she would be pregnant with my fourth child! - What about you? - What about me? - What do you want? - Nothing. Nothing, or you're just not telling me? Just to fix up this Mercedes and leave this place once and for all. But that's not even yours bro! It's been sitting there for 3 years. If it had a owner he would've claimed it by now. I've installed a stereo for it, I've cleaned it up, it's mine now. Your brother is rich and he owns all this land. And you're after fixing up this piece of shit to leave with?! - What can I do? Steal money from him? - Steal from him. He says he doesn't have any. He says he used up all his money to buy this piece of land for us to build a house on. - Are we included? - No, just his family. That's the benefit of having a brother. I sometimes get annoyed by him. I would've kicked his ass if he wasn't my brother. He thinks he's a somebody just because he has money. If you have money, you can be anybody you want. He has three wives up north. On weekends when he's not in the hood, he goes to them. He gives them his money. Not us. Three wives?! Yep. He's only gone on Fridays. Is he my brother or yours? Then wouldn't he have to be gone for 3 days and not 1?It doesn't add up. - Then where does he go to? - The orphanage. Where?! You didn't hear it from me. But they say he has opened up an orphanage. He pays to raise them so he can bring them in for work. Like he did with me. And others. I'm his brother, why don't I know about this? It's a secret. If they find out they will hang him. - If it's a secret then how do you know? - Someone told me. Don't believe what anyone tells you. I'm his brother, he would've told me. He keeps a low profile about it so they think he's minding his own business. If it's true, he would've told me, I'm his brother. Do you know why he doesn't trust you with the big gigs? Because he did once and we screwed it up? Because he knows you'll become bigger than him. Complete Subtitles Exclusively Arranged by:- Samaksh ~ Varsha ~ Pankaj Jain Complete Subtitles Exclusively Arranged by:- Samaksh ~ Varsha ~ Pankaj Jain - Omid? - Yes? - Whos that guy? - He's Jafar's dad. - Where has he been? - Prison. Serving 20 years. Why is he meeting him here? couldn't he find a better place? He's trustworthy. Plus he doesn't know what goes on here. With you as his consultant by next year we'll all be hanged! I didn't say anything, Shakur brought him over himself. How did he find out his son is here? He says in prison they told him Shakur is looking after his son. He came over as soon as he was released. - Does he expect something in return? - No, he's just thanking Shakur. Does Jafar want to leave? He's down to not go. But Shakur told him he must go. Then he yelled at everyone and said whoever else wants to go after his parents can. - You want to leave too? - What better place than this bro? - Yeah man. - True that. Omid is an idiot ass-kisser. You think if I ask Shakur who my parents are he would tell me? What for? What are parents good for? You're old now, if you were married your kid would have a kid already! My kid wouldn't want a grandpa? Wouldn't want an addict grandpa. No kid wants that. How do you know my dad was an addict? - Wouldn't want a murderer grandpa. - Are you playing with me? - You're high, you're talking nonsense. - No but how do you know? Show me a dad in the neighborhood who is clean. Masoud's dad is clean. - He isn't. - How so? He kills people. He's a surgeon. He has killed at least 10 people by now. Legally. What if he had killed your dad? Would it be legal then? Massoud's dad killed my dad? For example. My dad was killed by a surgeon?! You're such a hassle. Now my life is a hassle for you?! You won't say? How am I supposed to know? I don't know! Ask him yourself. Ask him where he found you? In a ditch. A street corner. What difference does it make? You've lost it! No more glue and shit for you. Why do I even want to know?! Suppose he points to a guy and says he's your father. Someone worse off than me. Like him. I would have to cover his ass too. What if you find your dad and he's a gentleman like Massoud's dad? How does it look Shahin? It's not crooked? I don't know. Don't be an ass, look at me. It's crooked. Omid, come over here and fix this. It looks fine, what do you want me to do? If my brother says it's crooked, it's crooked. Get it? I'm sorry sir. Shouldn't I come? Why, are you her mother? Father? How are you related? She's like my sister. No you're not qualified. How am I not qualified? You wanna come sit in front of her suitor and say what exactly? That she's like your sister? What's wrong with that? We're a rotten family as it is. We'd be lucky to not have any missteps. Do I look like a nobody? Would you lose face if I came? Goddamn it, I've had enough. Are you high? Give me the walkie. You'll stand guard tonight. What're you looking at? Go get the sweets. What do you have against me? Hey retard, if I had something against you I'd send you after that guy and he would've killed you and send me your corpse and I would've been delighted. All you do is talk shit. Soon enough everyone will ridicule me every chance they get. No one will ever dare ridicule any of you. So what? Shouldn't I be learning the trade? Suppose you have a heart attack and become crippled. Who will look after everything? I won't die until after I bury you. What's wrong with Amir? Nothing. He suddenly wants to know who his parents are. Once he finds his mommy he too will want to leave. - So what if he leaves? - What am I a charity? To pay for them to grow up only to watch some addict claim back their kids after thirty years? They're their parents! Where were they when they were leaving them in the streets? I only haven't breastfeed them. If it wasn't for me they'd be eaten by dogs, or frozen to death or someone worse than their parents would've come and forced labor on them. We have forced labor on them too! What's the difference? You think this line of work is the same as begging? I give them a place to sleep. I pay them. Have I ever forced them into labor? Sure, but they didn't choose to do this kind of work. It's my fault for not leaving this place for a better life uptown. I stayed for you guys. Who knows maybe you do have another life up there. - Stop with your nonsense. - Tell him then, he deserves to know. I will if he asks me. Not only him, if anyone of them asks I will tell them. I didn't kidnap them. Amir doesn't know what he wants. He once asked me to tell him, I was about to when he stopped me and said let me roll one first. He got high and started crying and said he doesn't want to know any more. - What about the others? They don't want to know? - Why should they know? What would you do if someone told you you're not you parents' child? Nothing. - They're indifferent just like you. - I'm indifferent? Put this over here. What's the matter with you? He's here. Shut up. Shut up! Afsar, why are you screaming?! Tell that son-of-a-bitch! Bickering like cats and dogs again? - Shahrouz has cut off all my hair. - Shohreh, don't provoke them. - Why did he cut your hair off? - He's a savage animal. Enough. I'm serious, he's an animal. He cut all my hair. So what, it'll grow again. What can I do for tonight then? Why, were you planning on coming out without your headscarf? You shut your mouth you moron. Find out what you did to upset him. Shahrouz open the door. I said open the door. Are you expecting a suitor or your mother's funeral? You look like shit, go fix yourself up. My dress doesn't have buttons. I sewed it back on, go wear it. You found the buttons? Yeah, I sewed it on, go ahead. It's a nuthouse here! Sweetheart, light up my charcoal. Shohreh, come over here. What? Is this a new bad habit you've picked up? You get bored and mess around with your hair? I didn't mess around. Are you even aware? No she's not. Shut up Shahin. What're you hiding? Nothing, I swear to God. God should strike you down. Looks like you want a beatdown. Shove it. Either spill the beans or shut your mouth. What's happening? Ask her. What is it? It's nothing. I was taking a nap and he came over and cut it off. Randomly? I swear to God. Why did you do this to your hair? Just because. Just because? You can't just be doing things just because! He's a kid, before you know it he'll go overboard. Take it easy. I will. Tell her not to go out so much. She keeps going out. Out for what? You have something to do out there? No I went to visit a friend. Forget your friends. A married woman doesn't need any friends. Yes sir. Your kid has lost it. Oh dear. You know nothing about parenting. Shahrouz, if you leave your room tonight I will kill you. Tell her to clean out her stuff, isn't there a suitor coming tonight? - He's just getting started. - Do we have to tell them everything? - Dad, did you shower? - I'm clean. Yeah I can see that! Do I have to shower you myself? It's your daughter's matchmaking for God sake. One of my friends just had an unexpected child. - So what? - He wants to get rid of it. Take off your shoes. I'm not interested. Go inside, go in. Are you retiring? I've raised enough kids. As soon as it's time for harvest they go after their own lives. What should I tell him? Nothing. Why, have you told him something? I said I know a guy who can't have a baby and is willing to pay for one. Are you trying to get me arrested? He's a friend. Friends who get high with you have big mouths. What can I tell him now? Nothing. Say your friend had a baby and no longer wants one. But I already got a commission from him. You shouldn't have! You got money without there being a trade?! It's my kids matchmaking ceremony tonight, I had to save face. How much did you get? 300 thousand tomans ($70). Where's the 300 tomans? Give it to me. Didn't you get it for your daughter? I bought the fruits, the pastries. Give me the money then! How many times do I have to tell you to sit home and smoke your opium so you don't get us into trouble. What should I tell him? Nothing. I'll pay him back later. Shower already. God damn it, what're you doing you dumb-ass? I didn't mean to, I wanted to drop it there but it fell here. Throw me a lighter. I don't have a lighter. Call them again to see where in hell they're at? I keep calling, it's turned off. I just hope to God you die already so I can finally rest easy. Why do you always hide all your shit? All my shit?! I don't have any shit! - What was his job? - They have a green house. - Do they think they're better than us? - No, they seemed like nice people. - Then why didn't they show up? - I don't know. - Did they change their mind? - No. How do you know? He bugged the hell out of me to come in and make it all official. Then why didn't they? Maybe something happened . Like what? I dunno, like an accident. All of them? Not possible? Then why didn't they call? How could they call if they're all dead from an accident? What if there was no accident? Then dead from natural causes. That's how much you trust them? If I didn't I wouldn't let them marry my sister. Tomorrow when you go over, I wanna get the news of their death. Yes. What if that's not the case? It will be. If he's not dead you can go hide wherever the fuck he is. What do you mean? You shouldn't have trusted a stranger. His name is now linked with Shohreh, if he doesn't marry her people will wonder why. People talk shit. If they do it's your fault. Why did you announce tonight's matchmaking ceremony everywhere? Why are you acting like a detective? He seemed like an alright guy, he told me he liked her, I told you, you said okay come over! I said if you vouch for him. Since when do you take me seriously? Oh now you're not afraid that I will screw things up? You only distrust me when it suits you. What's eating you up?! I've worked my ass off for you for years and you still don't give me a proper job. You think you have any brains for it? Any common sense?! You and that idiot Amir took 3 kilos of meth to sell and got no money to show for it! He'll bring it. It's been a year, where is it? I'll find him and get it from him. They hanged him the other day, find him where exactly?! For years I worked for free, take what I'm owed and we'll call it even. Alright we'll call it even. If you weren't my so-called brother I would've cut your ears off. Why do you keep threatening me? You wanna cut my ears off? Just admit that you're afraid I will be better than you, that you don't have a sense of loyalty to help me, that you rather be kind to strangers. Wanna cut my ears off? Be my guest! I haven't slapped you around in a while and you've gotten cocky. - Let go of me. - What will you do if I don't? Nothing, let me go. You're pathetic, you can't even pull your pants up. Why do you insist that it was my fault, it wasn't. It was. Yes, yes, it was. Will you handle it? Yes sir. It's 11 at night! Go to his house. I don't have his address. What kind of a friend is he if you don't even know where he lives?! He's Amirs friend. You've brought in a friend of that moron to marry your sister?! If he had showed up you would've gladly hand over Shohreh to him, now that he's a no show you're interrogating me. Why didn't you say anything before? Because I trusted your bitch ass. That's not it, you thought she's out of our control and wanted to get rid of her faster. Ouch! You have no shame, you either make sure he's dead or I'll make sure you are. Let me call you back. - Did we disrespect you in any way? - No. - Did we insist that you come? - No. - Did we fool around with your mother or sister?! - No, what're you saying?! Weren't you and your family supposed to come over last night? Yes. Stop giving me short answers. Answer me with details, why didn't you show up last night? - I wanted to call, but didn't get around to it. - Call me to say what? I trusted you so much that I told him you must be dead. And I trusted you. What? Did you know? Know what? About his sister. You bastard, watch your language when you speak about my sister, so what if she's a hairdresser? What did you babble about? What should we know that we don't? Get up. I said get up. - It has nothing to do with her working. - Then what's it about? Have you seen her video? There's this video of her. What video? With some guy. In an SUV. - Are you sure it's Shohreh? - Yeah! He tells her to take off your scarf so I see your ponytail. - Is that all or is there more? - That alone is enough for my family. I'm asking you if there's more to it that you're not telling us. - I didn't watch it to the end. - Can I watch it? I don't have it. My kid brother had it in his phone. Where did he get it from? I don't know, but your brother Shahrouz knows too. My brother has watched it? You didn't hear it from me. But yes. I wasn't brought up to mess around with other people's honor, but put yourself in my shoes, what would you do Shahin? What could I have told my family? Why didn't you say this sooner? What could I say Amir? How could I have helped the situation? What video have you seen of Shohreh and haven't told us? Ask her, what can I say? Don't make me beat both your sorry asses, what did you watch? I took care of it. Took care of it how you little bastard? This little bastard was paying attention when you weren't, I got rid of it, otherwise everyone would have it by now. What was in it? She's sitting in a car and some guy asks her to show her seven-colored ponytail. Where did you watch it? I didn't, Saman told me about it at school. What did he say? He said Farhad showed me a video with your sister. Farhad the trashman?! Was he the one filming? No, why do you insist on letting the world know? Me and Farhad handled it ourselves. Shut your mouth. Nemat and his family didn't show up because of this video. It's that viral. And you say forget about it?! It's not viral. I didn't let it. His big mouth brother Saman told him about it. - What if he tells others about it? - He won't, he only told his brother. I would also only tell you if I heard such a thing. - What about Farhad? - He deleted it. You went to him with a knife and asked him to delete it and you think he was scared into actually deleting it?! We got into a fight and then he agreed. So he's the one who stabbed you? You asked him to delete it, he didn't, you acted up and he cut you up? He said he deleted it. What if he hasn't you imbecile? What if the film's being shared around? We couldn't live here anymore! Everyday they'll point at us and say look at these idiots. You're shameless. He deleted it? That's all?! You went there with a bunch of kids and you think you're a hoodlum? Why didn't you kill him? Why didn't you kill him Shahrouz?! You're all talk! Talk and talk, no action! Take them off. Let me see. Take them off already. I can't here sir. Let me go do it in the toilet. If you don't trust me have Diesel come watch me. I saw it with my own eyes. He stole it from the scale, wrapped it up and swallowed it. He's lying! Why would I do that? I won't let you go until you do it in front of me. But sir- Shut your mouth. Take a dump and get it over with. For only 10 grams sir?! For stealing! Didn't you say you didn't do it? Squat! Get lost, get lost, get lost. Here you go sir. Thank you. Anything else sir? No. Shakur! Shakur! Shakur! Where to? Go over there. Step back. Step back. All his wounds are infected. He's dying. You bastard what did I ever do to you? I gave you so much and this is how you thank me? You think you're a tough guy? - Mr. Shakur. - You think you're tough?! - Calm down for a second Mr. Shakur. You pull a knife on my brother? Let go of me. - Why didn't I kill him? - You didn't have the balls to. - Couldn't I? - No couldn't. I didn't want to. He came over here and started acting tough and I just laughed. I said go away Shahrouz or else I will tell your brothers. He cursed me. I got up to pull his ear, he stabbed me. He stabbed me three times. In three different spots.He went in deep. I didn't hit back because of you. I tried to spin his hand away it scratched his side. What could I've done? Let him kill me? He should've killed you. You don't mean that. What's this video in your phone? You should be thankful that it's with me, that I warned you guys. Couldn't I just share it around? No you couldn't. Yeah I couldn't. Farhad? Now that I'm bedridden, unable to do anything, you're just threatening me. Shut up. I'll stick around until you're well to see if you have the ball to do anything. Sir, Farhad told people to send you a message. He then told Saman to tell Shahrouz he wants to see him. Why didn't you tell me? I couldn't be seen outside. I swear to God I was trapped in here for my own stuff. You could've called. I must've called you a hundred times. You wouldn't answer. I wasn't dead, you could've sent a message. I did. I told Saman, Shahrouz's friend. Told him to tell Shahrouz to come here to see me. What exactly did you tell him? You showed the video to Saman and told him to go tell Shahrouz? Didn't you know Saman is Nemat's brother? Didn't you know Nemat was coming to ask for my sister's hand in marriage? I knew. But I didn't show the video to Saman. Only me and Shahrouz have seen the video. He's full of shit. Saman told Shahrouz he saw it first in Farhad's phone. Nothing about a message. What's he saying? Are you fucking with me?! I swear to my father's grave I'm not. I don't know where Saman could've seen it. And I told Shahrouz to come here. I just wanted to tell him to go tell your brothers that they're losing face. That they should come here so we think of something to do. But he wouldn't let me talk, he kept asking to watch the video. I would say who said anything about a video? But he wouldn't listen. He was nuts. Where did you get the video from? One night we weren't feeling alright, so we carjacked a Peugeot uptown. Took his wallet, cell phone and everything. Did you know him? I said we carjacked him. Where's the video? Sir, whatever you broke, whoever you beat up, it was well-deserved, I would've done the same thing. But I swear to the God that you worship, we had nothing to do with any of this. And it all stays in this room. As far as we know you didn't come here and we don't know anything about nothing. And you should be thankful that no one else has seen it, or else it would've been difficult to handle it. No one has seen it? Shahrouz said Saman has seen it. Nemat also mentioned something about his kid brother showing it to him. If it's not shared around how was it in his phone? Where did he watch it? Where did he find it? How? If you haven't shown him the film how in the hell was it in his phone so he could show it to Nemat? Shahin don't blame all this on us. I'm saying it wasn't us, what're you even saying? If they didn't send the video to Saman then who did?! Could be anyone! Why do you keep blaming only us? Anyone could have it. Anyone! Take that! Good luck finding this anyone around town. Anyone who has a phone. Anyone who has the video. Beat everyone of them to see if it gets contained. They're saying they carjacked some random guy and found the video on his phone. Shahrouz and Nemat are saying that it was shot in an SUV. Which means the person filming is someone other than the guy they stole the phone from. Hi, I'm sorry, I'm late because of traffic. Shahin. Hi. Where are you? I didn't hear you call. Shahrouz, what're you doing? Shahrouz! Shahrouz! Shahrouz! Shahin! Shahin! Shakur forgive me! Forgive me Shakur! Shakur l can't breath. Dad I can't breath. I'm sorry Shakur. For God's sake. Shakur, please! Dad! Dad! Did he do this on his own or did you tell him to? I'm talking to you? Didn't you say you have to talk to her? To find out who the guy was? Why did you do this? I broke that phone and said it's over. You're the one who kept nagging about how there's no fixing it. Something that you can't fix, you have to erase. I'm saying why didn't you tell me? - Mr. Shakur, are you outside sir? - You didn't tell me, you told Shahrouz, why?! Sir, do you hear me? Please answer me. The cops are on their way. Do you hear me? What should we do? Bury her, bury her. Sir, they'll be here in 5 minutes. There's an army of them. Sir, we're all running away. Give it to me. Where's Diesel? Diesel. Diesel, come here! Can't you see what's going on? Let's go! Go where? This is my home! You're surrounded. Get out of the building. Do you hear me? You're surrounded. Get out of the building. This is the last warning. I repeat. Put your hands on your heads and get out. Shahin, take Shahrouz with you. Shahin, come here! What're you doing?! Come already! Hurry UP- don't push me. Didn't I tell you to shut up? Get in the car. Hurry. Get in. Hey uncle, give us two cups of tea. Why do you keep calling everyone uncle? Just so in case of a fight they don't cuss my mother. You don't even have a mother. Where did you get money from? What money? Money to pay for this crap. I thought you'll cover it. Where do I get it from? You mean you don't have any? - Who is supposed to pay me? - I don't know. Shakur? - Where is Shakur? - Prison. When will he be out? When will my brother be out? Never. - Then who will pay for you? - Myself. - How? - I don't know. - Who will pay for your cigarettes? - That's enough Shahin. - Who will pay for the roof above your head? - I won't eat. - Who will pay you to go marry that shitty girl? - Shahin, don't shout buddy! - Who will pay for your drugs? - l'm sorry, don't do this. Please don't. Eat it. Eat it. I'm ordering you to eat it. No thanks, I lost my appetite. You'll regain it. I said eat it. You have to eat it. You have to eat all of it. Don't do this Shahin. I don't feel like it uncle! Uncle has no use no more. Eat it. Eat every last bite. Open your mouth. - Okay I will eat it Shahin. I will eat it. As you wish. As you wish. What are you looking at? Murder. - What're you in for? - Brawling. Brawling, fighting. - What was your crime? - Brawling. - How old are you? - I'm 22. - What are these scars on your hand? - I did it to myself. - For what crime did they arrest you? - Felony. Go right in. We won't do this again. Where is the key to the basement? What do you want the key for? I want to search it. She's not in there. Give me the key. Get it through your thick skull that with my own two eyes I saw her walk out that door. You were high and seeing things. Drug withdrawal causes hallucination, not being high. She was no longer breathing, how could she get up and leave? You're asking me? You were at home. A corpse doesn't just grow wings and fly away. I'm telling you, I saw her get up and run away. Why didn't you stop her? if she goes and tells on us first and foremost they'll arrest you. How's it any of my business? Did you even consult with me when you were choking her like ISIS fighters? You have no shame do you? No I don't. If I did I wouldn't let you do that to my innocent child. Did you help her? Yes, if it bothers you, yes I did. I helped her up, washed her face and I told her to get as far away as possible. I said you're all animals, not humans. Yeah you're a human! A good human too, you just kept making babies. No l'm not a human either. If I was I would've been able to raise you all as humans. You see that crippled mother of yours? For thirty years she's been using that retarded brain of hers and claiming to know what she's doing with her kids. Now she gets to pick the rotten fruits of her life's work. I was never a human. Never claimed to be one. She's the one who has to answer for it in judgment day. I'm not planning on dying. Bad people don't die. I'll be around to pay for my sins. And if you find your sister, tell her to live her life to the fullest. - Stolen cell phones You have a price? No. Does it have a deed? Yeah of course. You have a power of attorney? What's that? Doesn't this place belong to Shakur? So? Isn't this place under Shakur's name? It is. Are you messing with me?! What do you mean? How can I sell a piece of land that's not in your name? I'm in a jam, figure something out. I can't figure anything out. You have to have a power of attorney. And that's that. Wait a minute. - Why are you hitting me? - We're talking. No one wants to hit you. You know anyone who could invest and become a partner with me? I'll provide the land, he'll do the work. This place is not yours to sell. Figure something out, I'll give you a good commission. You don't get it do you? I can't sell other people's properties. It's my brother's, it's not other people's! If he's your brother, then get a power of attorney from him. I can't do that in the prison. Why can't you? Hey dumb-ass why do you keep asking questions? Would you ask Shakur so many questions? Does Shakur even know? It's none of your business. Get lost. Good job. From now on that's how you have to treat these assholes so they're afraid of you. Pull up your hair. What for? Don't be shy. I swear you're more intimidating this way. Cut this off. Shahin. What? Please take me to see my kids tomorrow. They won't let us in. If they don't let me in, who would they let in? I'll have Massoud pull some strings. Why is he a rat now? No, he's a draftee there and knows people. Have him come over tomorrow, I want to see him. - Don't you know he won't come here no more? - Why won't he? - Because you cussed him out. - He deserved it. Who asks for his sister's hands in marriage?! For 15 years she was calling him a brother. If back then you had let him marry Shohreh, none of this shit would've happened. How was I supposed to know that hairdressing was just a front for her? How many times did I tell you not to let her work? Women aren't supposed to work. Hairdressing isn't even a job. You guys should've been paying attention. Why did you keep defending her? You son-of-a-bitch. Don't talk as though I don't know what honor and shame is. I was always looking after her. Sure, but only when she was at home. The rest was your duty. You were her brother. You think it was easy for me to let them choke her to death? To bury her? To pretend to not have seen any of it? Forget about it, you'll have a heart attack again. No one knows where she's at. Have you even looked for her? It's a big city, how am I supposed to find her? Stan with that hairdressing studio. See if she's there. Why are you even here right now? Aren't you a man? If Shahrouz was around he would've searched the whole city. Alright fine, tomorrow I will go find her and have her come kiss your feet, then I will cut her head off. How's that?! Just stop bugging me. Cut her head off? You pass out when you see blood! You couldn't even cut a rooster's head. Cut her head my ass! I pass out when I see blood? You just bark. Hus: bark?! Don't repeat whatever I say. You think I don't know why you escaped? Escaped from where? You and that good-for-nothing Amir didn't bother to stick around to help your brothers. You escaped. Says who?! Were you there? There were so many bullets flying you couldn't hear anyone. I was almost hit three times. Three times! Shakur told me to take Shahrouz away and I did. Then where is he? Where's Shahrouz? They were shooting at us. In the middle of all that chaos I still went over and grabbed Shahrouz. But he ran away from me. He wouldn't come. For him it was all a game! He ran away from you, you ran away completely! What is it, you're upset that I'm here and they're there? No I'm upset about you leaving them. Just say it, you're upset that I'm not on death row. Call your uncle tomorrow and have him take your grandma. Poor thing. I can no longer look after her. Do you have to make so much noise here? It's a wonder why his heart doesn't just stop?! He has two sons in prison and he could care less. I would be buying a castle right about now if anyone but him was my husband. His biggest contribution for his kids is starting all their names with a 'Sh'! Dear lord, I'm at your mercy. I want my kids back. What're you doing here? I called and Mr. Shakur wouldn't answer. Is he home? Damn, you stink! No he's not. Where is he? Prison. They got him? No, they sent him off to teach! What can I do now? What did you do before? Do that. And don't come here again. My parents are resting. - Listen to me for a second. - don't touch me. Listen, seriously, what can I do now? I don't know! I keep telling you they've arrested Shakur but you don't seem to get it. It's all over. Stop coming here, it's dangerous. Listen, Shakur had me look after a place. Now I don't know what to do with it. What place? Shakur had asked me to never show my face here.But things are bad. We didn't pay the bills, so we no longer have water and power. I personally haven't eaten for three days. My sheep are dying. Come take a look at this. Poor things are dying from hunger. Why isn't this silencing him? He's sick. He's losing his legs. What for? I don't know, he has some-tism or something we have to leave him in the sun. Have you? No Shakur said he's a lost cause and is no longer useful to us. So you'll just let him die? You have to leave the kid under the sun. He has to get well. Starting tomorrow I will pay for you myself. From now on whatever I say you'll obey. But Shakur will be mad. Forget Shakur. I'll be the one paying you. Get rid of these sheep. It stinks around here, no wonder these kids get sick. They're not ours to get rid of. They have to stay. Stay for what? It's a rented space. If you want to make them leave you have to rent the whole place. How much do they want? 20 million ($5000). Did they get off of it? Who? Your parents. They've always been clean. They're classy people. Then why did they leave you on the side of a road? Who said they did? Everyone. I was kidnapped when I was a newborn. Then they sold me off. You've asked me this a million times. To them? Yes. Did you find them easily? You know the answer, why keep asking? What were they like when they saw you? What am I supposed to tell him? Just tell me what it was like. How many times do you ask? Uncle, it's my first time asking. It's your first time asking? It's his first time asking?! It's not my first time asking?! No. Up until now I thought your parents had left you, I didn't know you were kidnapped. You've asked a few thousand times. Bro, if it's such a burden to hang out with me, tell me so I don't even bother to come! - Massoud. - What? Come here. What is it? Why doesn't he bring it? He will, he's slow, but he will. - You want to be business partners? - What about you? It's an awesome business. Give me 20 millions, by the year's end I'll give you 40 back. No I'm good. Your dad is giving you this money, why not come in on this? It's a loan. What's that supposed to mean? Nothing against you. Are you telling me I have to return the 20 soon? No man, I borrowed that money from him and will pay him back myself. You pay me whenever you can. Will he bring cash? Who has 20 millions in cash?! He'll write a check for seven days from now. - What're you looking at? - Nothing. Just playing my game. Come here. A check for when? Seven days from now. Say seven. What? Seven. Seven. Seven colors. Seven colors. Why are you saying it like that? Stretch your word. Seven colors. What got into you? You know anyone at the prison? I want to take mom to see Shakur. Bro, you don't need to know anyone. You can just take her. You want to see him too? I can't send her alone. Are you sure they're not after you? If Shakur wanted to rat us out he would've by now. The person who ratted you guys out has probably given all your names. I'm just saying be careful not to get in trouble. No one ratted us out. The hood's always been like this. A herd would come in and take us away in bulk. I'm just looking out for you. They're all in there, I would be with them too. You're a bullhead now. I've always been. He's a bullhead now. Yeah man. Your uncle here is unbearable now! Give me a coin. I don't have one. The big one is mine to keep. Watch and learn. Shahin. Tomorrow I will get my card. Congratulations. Done with my service for good. Great! Bro. You know I'm still in. For what? I mean still waiting. Waiting for? For you to let go. Forget it. I don't want your money. Let's go. As soon as I ask you for a favor you want something in return? What's it got to do with money?! I don't want it. If you don't take the money I will burn it so you don't think it's because of the money. It's not my first time saying this. Even if I let it happen, Afsar won't, if she does, Shakur won't. I'm not even her elder, I don't speak for her. Shakur is not around. Only your mother has to agree. Shame on you, Shakur is not home, but he's still alive. I mean maybe you can talk to her now. Forget about it Massoud. I can't Just try. Go after someone else. I know what happened. What happened? I heard a suitor was a no-show. Really? So what? I don't want to wait around until someone else shows up. Don't worry, no one will come for her. Are you coming? Yeah, let's go. Are you leaving? I brought you tea. Have your tea first. - Thank you very much. - You really didn't have to. Please allow me It was my pleasure. I made this out for you son. It was 20, right? Thanks. - I'm downstairs if you need me. - Thank you. Goodnight. Amir can you go downstairs for a second? Was that your dad? I liked him! Alright, I'll be downstairs. Here's the 20. Keep it. Yours to keep. They're not open at 8am. They are. What kind of a moron gets her hair done at 8? Women. You're wrong. Are you blind, don't you see the bride's car? I figured the woman must've been crazy to be here since 6am. The dude has been blow-drying his hair since 3am! You notice the dedication?! These people have been in there for at least three days. Do you see Shohreh amongst them? They all look alike. I can't tell them apart. I'm sorry Miss. Yes? We had a few questions. Don't be afraid ladies. Why did your friends back away? You guys go right ahead. They're afraid? Don't come in here, it's women only. Are we in right now?! Stand back. I don't get it, why do people think we're monsters? Tell Shohreh to come down. We don't have a Shohreh here. I've personally dropped her off here before. She's hasn't been in for 10 days. I thought you said you didn't know her. Where is she? She came in for her last payment and said she's getting married and won't come back. You don't know where her friend is? I've already said too much. Who are you anyways? He's Shohreh's brother. Shohreh has been missing for 10 days now. Please help us find her before you get involved too. What do you mean missing? What's your name? Mona. You don't know where Shohreh is? I haven't heard from her. Are you sure? How do you know she's missing? Who said she's missing? You did. When did we say that? I told her a few seconds ago. Where's she? How am I supposed to know? Isn't she your friend? She was when she worked here. We're not too close to know each other's whereabouts. We just went out a couple of times. Out where? Velenjak. Vista. Vista? What's a vista? Where's that? It's very far from here. When's the last time you saw her? I don't know. Since she stopped working here. She called me that night and asked if she can spend the night at our place. I said we have guests. She hung up and I never heard from her again. Give me your phone. What for? Give it to me. I won't, it's my phone, why should I give it to you? Don't worry about it, just give it to him. Give me your phone. Just tell me what you want. Give it to me. What's the pass code? Where's her number then? It's been more than ten days, the recents calls don't go that far. I punched in my number. If you hear from her call me up. That was a classic move, the way you got her digits! Ouch! Hit me, hit me again! It was Massoud. So what? He said he got you and your mom an appointment at the prison for Wednesday. They're living the life man. Shahin! Holy shit! Complete Subtitles Exclusively Arranged by:- Samaksh ~ Varsha ~ Pankaj Jain Why won't you just tell him? She was his mother too. If you tell him all of us dropped dead he would careless. But if he learns mother is gone, he will raise hell in there. If he finds out that you knew and didn't tell him he'll get mad. So be it. But I won't tell him. Will you tell him about Shohreh? You talk too much. I'm just looking out for you bro. From now on I will decide what is said and when. I won't tell him about Shohreh, I will handle it myself. He'll go crazy if he finds out Shohreh ran away. He'll snap at me and I will snap back. You wanna become a shepherd? If my sheep are like you, then yes. You mean from now on we can get an allowance from you? Hey retard, I'm talking about big money here, you're discussing allowances?! When did you talk about it? It's my first time hearing it Mr. Shepherd! The shepherd is in there. I'm Shahin. Got it? Got it. I doubt you get it. Shahin. What is it now, Shahin Shahin?! Ask him. I couldn't sleep last night thinking I would never find out if they hang him. Hello. Why are you wearing black? No reason. Everyone's alright? Yeah, they're alright. Where's mother? She had chest pain. Is she alive? Yeah man. What about Shohreh? What about her? Does anyone know anything? No. Amir is with me. He has thought about it and wants to know now. There's a hut near the water plant, a guy by the name of Ahad lives there. Have him go there and say I sent him. That guy knows? - That guy is his father. - Oh. What did you say about Shohreh? I said nothing. You asked if anyone knows, I said no. Why do I keep dreaming about her? Would you have forgiven her if she was still alive? I mean I wouldn't. Things are falling apart. Mother needs a heart operation. I need money. I want to hire a lawyer and bring Shahrouz out. You hear me? What're you saying? Man, why are you treating me like this? Like what? You don't even look at me when I talk to you. Are you here for money? I came to see you. You came for a power of attorney. What? I've heard you were trying to sell my land. Your land?! Do you even have a piece of land?! You didn't know? - I seem to know nothing about you. - You had taken Soroush to my land to try and I did. Amir said some guy he knows wants to sell his land, we could sell it for him and get a commission. I'm inside here. Who wants to sell my land then? I'll look into you and beat the crap out of whoever it is that's trying to. Is this why you're upset with me? Wouldn't you be if you heard your own brother is trying to usurp your land? You mean you thought I was double crossing you? Come on man! You're in here, you're not out there. Only ten more minutes. I'm struggling. We have nothing. - I had set aside a miniscule load of- - Alright, calm down. And I sold it to cover father's hits. To put food on the table at home. I've been up day and night and you think I tried to double cross you'? Alright fine. I made a mistake. I've become paranoid in here. Sit down. Sit. You'd act the same way out there. Why are you bugging out? I said sit down. I'm not bugging out. It's the truth. Listen bro, my death sentence has been finalized. I took responsibility for Shahrouz too. I said he was just visiting me and they arrested him by mistake. Now that they're hanging me, I want to confess to Shohreh's murder. If they find out and discover her body it'll be a headache. Look after Shahrouz when I'm not around. If they find out he killed her he'll get life. Once he's out take him out of the hood. Get him started with a business. Go inside the tunnel. There's a cross on the wall. I've hidden some money in there. Everything I have is in there. Take the cash and leave the hood with everyone. Don't waste the money. If you confess to Shohreh's murder, then you have no chance of ever surviving this. I'm worried about Shahrouz. Two death sentences doesn't concern you? Death is death. No it's not. Many people have choked to death then came back to life. Once they drop me, my neck will break, it won't come down to choking. Suppose it does. Why are you insisting that I don't confess to Shohreh's murder? I'm saying they'll drag you up there for one crime, then bring you back to life and take you up once more for the second crime. I'm talking about a living human being. Shahrouz. Oh Shahrouz?! Tell me. Did Soroush tell you to come get a power of attorney from me? You mean you knew that the land was mine? Then why do you now claim that you didn't know? You are double-crossing me aren't you? Is that why you're afraid of me ratting out Shohreh's corpse? So you have an excuse to imprison Shahrouz? To accuse him of murdering his sister? Are you insane? You figure I'll be dead in a couple of days and you can take my place and become the new king. You know nothing and you're just making shit up. - Why don't you inform me then? - Whatever, think however you like. - What other crap have you done? - I give up. You're right. What can I do for you now? You're absolutely right. - I shouldn't have told you where the money is. - I shouldn't have come here I should've known from the second you tried to sell my land that you're gunning for me. You should've known then. Don't talk to me like that. You're saying whatever the fuck comes to your mind. Stop accusing me of shit. Lower your voice. I won't, what will you do about it? You're acting tough because you know I can't do anything here. Yeah what now? Shahin, watch it. I won't. What're you going to do about it? Alright. I made a mistake. No shit! You make mistakes too?! That's enough. Take some of the money and give the rest to Shahrouz. I won't give him a dime. How will you get it from me? I can't There you have it. I will pay him when I feel like it. Whenever I want to. I make the decisions now. Do you understand? Yeah I understand. Why does he matter to you so much and I don't? Because he's a kid and he doesn't have anyone. He doesn't have a brain either. He'll blow the money. I want to start my own kitchen and manage it myself. I'll replace Ebi with Shahrouz. Who will you replace? Ebi. How do you know about Ebi? I kept telling you to let me start something up. You said you're no longer in the kid business and no one else has the right to start one either. I don't even know you. Don't. I have nothing to say to you. Up until now it was always about you ordering us around. Now it's my turn. Calm down sir. Who do you think you are? We gave you our whole lives and you screwed it up. Enough is enough. I didn't make any mistakes to have you be my brother as punishment. I'm the one who made the mistake of not throwing you to dogs twenty years ago. I made the mistake of not beating your ass when I brought you home so you understand that you have no parents. I made the mistake of not breaking all your teeth when you'd call my mother mom, so that now after all these years you double cross me. So you talk so much shit in my ears that I get cornered into killing my own sister. I thought you were defending your honor because Shohreh is your sister, I had forgotten that you don't even share our blood. You had me kill her for vengeance. I killed her because she was my sister. - Get up. Get up. Get up. - Because my ears would overheat when I would think people are talking behind my back. - Your time is up. Get up. Let's go. Come here. You're a nobody. I thought you were my brother. But you're a nobody. Probably a bastard child of some sick relationship. A dog is better than you, because at least he knows who his owner is. - Let's go sir, let's go. I worked hard for you for 20 years. I was like a father to you. You better watch your back. I'll send my people to you. One of these days someone will choke you from behind. They'll kill you like a dog you bastard. I'm a death now. That's enough, let's go. I'll confess to Shohreh's murder and list you as my accomplice. Shakur. Your mother is dead. You gotta do something here? Get off. What for? Get off. Uncle, you haven't said a word the whole way, now you're dropping me off at the water plant? His name is Ahad. Tell him we sent you. Who is Ahad? Your father. I have nothing to do here bro. Let's get out of here. I told you not to tell me who my father is. I don't want to know. Why are you doing this? Go away. Go to your dad. Shahin, I'm sorry. I said go to your dad. Who's back there? Oh it's you? I thought it was a thief or something. Thanks, you got the money! What's that smell? It's nothing. The sheep are dying. One two three four five six Come out he's gone. Shahin, for God's sake don't do anything to her. She made a mistake. Forgive her. She went to hell and back. Shahin, I beg of you. I beg you. Why did you hit me? Why did you heat up a coke bottle and pressed it against my forehead? For a stupid ball! You kept me from going to school for a whole week. Why did you let the others go? Why didn't you hit the others? Every chance you had you'd beat me. Because I was other people's kid. Because I didn't have your blood. Fuck your dirty blood, for abusing someone else's kid. Burn in hell. Who would get you your fix? Your actual son? Who was it who would work for peanuts and pay for the curtains at home? Would buy a new couch? Your bastard son says it was a mistake that he raised me. That only he knows who my actual parents are. Where am I going to find them? Were you my dad? You had no right to scar my forehead. Your wife would tell me her kids are being hanged why are you sitting in front of me? Who do I have to find? Who can I say I'm related to? I will make your lives a living hell. Don't worry, I have nothing to do with her. She was my sister then. My blood. And if I haven't left yet, it's because I want to ruin your lives. I'm here to get what's mine. This whole place is mine. This is mine. This is mine. This. This. This is mine. Everything here is mine. - Shahin, what're you doing? - That's my bag. - Shahin I will give it back to you. - This is my bag. Let go of it. - I swear they'll come. They'll come and kill me. - You're going nowhere. Nowhere. Shahin, please. Shahrouz is on his way back. You will no longer touch anything in this house. It's all mine. Shahin what're you doing? I swear they've called and said Shahrouz is on his way back. Who filmed you? Tell me or else I won't let you go. Some guy. You don't know him. Massoud? What's this got to do with Massoud? Are you protecting him? I have nothing to do with him. Do you love him? I said I hate him. Then why are you defending him? I didn't defend him. Then why do you say it wasn't him? That's defending? I said it wasn't him. Massoud hasn't been around since the fight with mom. Is that why you hate him? Because he didn't fight for you? Then who was it? Some guy- Some guy doesn't have a name? No he doesn't. He picked you up in the streets? Screw you. Shame on you. You don't know him, you got in his car and showed him your hair. He was Mona's fiance. It was raining so he said they'll drop me off somewhere. That's all. Mona has a fiance? She did. She no longer has one. He's on the run. Stole money from Mona's dad and disappeared. Why did you get in his car? I said Mona knew him. I didn't think he'd be so sick that he would film me. Mona asked me to show my hair and I said no. The guy kept on insisting and I finally caved. You refused when Mona asked you, but the guy asks and you show your hair? Why are you trying to make something out of nothing? Why didn't you show your hair from underneath your scarf? Didn't you know that you'd show more than just your hair without the scarf? What're you after Shahin? Why didn't you ask me these questions before you all decided to kill me? I wanted them to ask you. No back then I was still your sister, I'm now other people's daughter. Back then I deserved to die, now I get to speak. Shahin, what's the legal punishment for what I've done? Is it more than an execution? You guys already executed me once, is that not enough for you? Do it again. You think I will fight back? I swear I won't. Even if you don't kill me, Shahrouz will come after me. I am fearful enough. I don't even know where to go hide so people don't point their fingers at me. Just let me leave. I swear I wanted to leave that first night. Mom wouldn't let me. They both cried their eyes out saying they'll die if I leave. I felt sorry for them and hid in the basement. One day dad brings in this addict and tells me he's willing to marry you. What have I done wrong that he's willing to marry me?! I hate myself more than I could ever hate you guys. Who wanted you dead? I don't know. Wear your chador. I will take you to the bus terminal myself. Cover your face so no one recognizes you. If they see you they'll tell Shahrouz. He'll find you wherever you are. Take this. Keep it. Hey dipshit you stole money from me. Where is it? Watch it asshole. don't come in here. What did you say? You want me to get out? Yeah don't come in, if you do I'll break your legs. You want me to tell Shakur to send his men to beat your ass? Shakur's men?! He sent me to get you! You're lucky he said not to cut your head off. Get lost. Whose ass will you kiss once they hang him? Someone else's ass. Get lost. I don't feel like beating you here. Give me the money I spent on this place. Go get it from Shakur. In fact, he asked that you go get it from him. Now get lost. don't waste my time. They say without a shepherd the sheep die or get lost. Or the wolves attack them or they starve. Because they have no brains. Whoever doesn't have a brain needs a shepherd. A caring shepherd. A shepherd is like a father to the sheep. A man without a father is a nobody. This is our shepherd. We're all his sheep. He tells us where to go, when to go and what to do. When to sit, when to stand and when to die. Complete Subtitles Exclusively Arranged by:- Samaksh ~ Varsha ~ Pankaj Jain
