[majestic music] I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall. It did always seem so to us, but now in the division of the kingdom, it appears not which of the Dukes he values most, for equalities are so weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice of either's moiety. Is not this your son, my lord? His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge. I have so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am brazed to it [laughs]. I cannot conceive you. Sir, this young fellow's mother could [laughs]. Whereupon she grew round-wombed, and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed [laughs]. Do you smell a fault? I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper. But I have sir, a son by order of law, some year elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account. Though this knave came something saucily to the world before he was sent for, yet was his mother fair, for there was good sport at his making [laughs], and the whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this noble gentleman, Edmund? No, my lord. My Lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter as my honorable friend. My services to your lordship. I must love you, and sue to know you better. Sir, I shall study deserving. And he hath been out nine years, and away he shall again. [footsteps clattering] The King is coming. Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester. I shall, my liege. Meantime we shall express our darker purpose. Give me the map there. Know that we have divided in three our kingdom, and 'tis our fast intent to shake all care and business from our age, conferring them on younger strengths, while we unburdened crawl towards death. Our son of Cornwall, and you, our no less loving son of Albany, we have this hour a constant will to publish our daughters' several dowers, that future strife may be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy, great rivals in our youngest daughter's love, long in our courts have made their amorous sojourn, and here are to be answered. Tell me, my daughters, since now we will divest us both of rule, interest of territory, cares of state, which of you shall we say doth love us most, that we our largest bounty may extend where nature doth with merit challenge? Goneril, our eldest-born, speak first. Sir, I love you more than word can wield the matter, dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty, beyond what can be valued, rich or rare, no less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honor, as much as child e'er loved, or father found, a love that makes breath poor, and speech unable, beyond all manner of so much I love you. What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent. Of all these bounds, even from this line to this, with shadowy forests and with champains riched, with plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads, we make thee lady. To thine and Albany's issues be this perpetual. What says our second daughter, our dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall? Speak. I am made of that self metal as my sister, and prize me at her worth. In my true heart I find she names my very deed of love, only she comes too short, that I profess myself an enemy to all other joys which the most precious square of sense possesses and find I am alone felicitate in your dear Highness' love. Then poor Cordelia! And yet not so, since I am sure my love's more ponderous than my tongue. To thee and thine hereditary ever remain this ample third of our fair kingdom, no less in space, validity, and pleasure, than that conferred on Goneril. Now, our joy, although our last and least, to whose young love the vines of France and milk of Burgundy strive to be interessed. What can you say to win a third more opulent than your sisters'? Speak. Nothing, my lord. Nothing? Nothing. Nothing will come of nothing, speak again. Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave my heart into my mouth. I love your Majesty according to my bond, no more nor less-- How, how, Cordelia? Amend your speech a little, lest you may mar your fortunes. Good my lord. You have begot me, bred me, loved me. I return those duties back as are right fit. Obey you, love you, and most honor you. Why have my sisters' husbands, if they say they love you all? Happily, when I shall wed, that lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry half my love with him, half my care and duty. Sure I shall never marry like my sisters, to love my father all. But goes thy heart with this? Ay, my good lord. So young, and so untender? So young, my lord, and true. Let it be so. Thy truth then be thy dower. For by the sacred radiance of the sun, the mysteries of Hecat and the night, by all the operation of the orbs, from whom we do exist and cease to be, here I disclaim all my paternal care, propinquity, and property of blood, and as a stranger to my heart and me hold thee from this forever. The barbarous Scythian, or he that makes his generation messes to gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom be as well neighbored, pitied, and relieved, as thou my sometime daughter. [Kent] Good my liege-- Peace, Kent! Come not between the dragon and his wrath. I loved her most, and thought to set my rest on her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight! So be my grave my peace, as here I give her father's heart from her. Call France. Who stirs? Call Burgundy, Cornwall, Albany. With my two daughters' dowers digest this third. Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her. I do invest you jointly with my power, pre-eminence, and all the large effects that troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course, with reservation of an hundred knights by you to be sustained, shall our abode make with you by due turns. Only we will retain the name, and all the addition of a king, the sway, revenue, execution of the rest, beloved sons, be yours, which to confirm, this coronet part between you-- Royal Lear, whom I have ever honored as my king, loved as my father, as my master followed, as my great patron thought on in my prayers-- The bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft. Let it fall rather, though the fork invade the region of my heart. Be Kent unmannerly when Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man? Think'st though that duty shall have dread to speak when power to flattery bows? [gasps] To plainness honor's bound, when majesty falls to folly. Reserve thy state, and in my best consideration check this hideous rashness. Answer my life my judgment, thy youngest daughter does not love thee least, nor are those empty-hearted whose low sounds reverb no hollowness. Kent, on thy life, no more. My life I never held but as a pawn to wage against thine enemies, nor feared to lose it, thy safety being motive. Out of my sight! See better, Lear, and let me still remain the true blank of thine eye. Now, by Apollo-- Now, by Apollo, King, thou swearest thy gods in vain. O vassal! Miscreant! [Both] Dear sir, forbear. Do! Kill thy physician, and thy fee bestow upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift, or whilst I can vent clamor from my throat, I'll tell thee thou dost evil. Hear me, recreant! On thine allegiance, hear me! Since thou has sought to make us break our vow, which we durst never yet, and by strained pride to come betwixt our sentence and our power, which not our nature nor our place can bear, our potency made good, take thine reward. Five days we do allot thee for provision to shield thee from disasters of the world, and on the sixth to turn thy hated back upon our kingdom. If, on the 10th day following, thy banished trunk be found in our dominion, the moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter, this shall not be revoked. Fare thee well, King. Since thus thou wilt appear, freedom lives hence, and banishment is here. The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid, that justly think'st and hast most rightly said! And your large speeches may your deeds approve, that good effects may spring from words of love. Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu. He'll shape his old course in a country new. Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord. My Lord of Burgundy, we first address toward you, who with this king hath rivaled for our daughter. What in the least will you require in present dower with her, or cease your quest of love? Most royal Majesty, I crave no more than hath your Highness offered, nor will you tender less. Right noble Burgundy, when she was dear to us, we did hold her so, but now her price is fallen. Sir, there she stands. If aught within this little-seeming substance, or all of it, with our displeasure pieced, and nothing more, may haply like your Grace, she's there, and she is yours. I know no answer. Will you, with these infirmities she owes, unfriended, new adopted to our hate, dowered with our curse, and strangered with our oath, take her, or leave her? Pardon me, royal sir. Election makes not up in such conditions. Then leave her, sir, for by the power that made me, I tell you all her wealth. For you, great King, I would not from your love make such a stray to match you where I hate, therefore beseech you to avert your liking a more worthier way than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed almost to acknowledge hers. This is most strange, that she whom even but now was your best object, the argument of your praise, balm of your age, the best, the dearest, should in this trice of time commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle so many folds of favor. Sure, her offense must be of such unnatural degree that monsters it, or your fore-vouched affection fall into taint, which to believe of her must be a faith that reason without miracle should never plant in me. I yet beseech your Majesty, if for I want that glib and oily art to speak and purpose not, since what I well intend, I'll do it before I speak, that you make known it is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness, no unchaste action or dishonored step, that hath deprived me of your grace and favor, but even for want of that for which I am richer, a still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue that I am glad I have not, though not to have it hath lost me in your liking. Better thou hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better. Is it but this, a tardiness in nature that often leaves the history unspoke which it intends to do? My Lord of Burgundy, what say you to the lady? Love's not love when it is mingled with regards that stands aloof from the entire point. Will you have her? She is herself a dowry. Royal Majesty, give but that portion which yourself proposed, and here I take Cordelia by the hand, Duchess of Burgundy. Nothing! I have sworn. I am firm. I am sorry then you have so lost a father that you must lose a husband. Peace be with Burgundy! Since that respects of fortune are his love, I shall not be his wife. Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor, most choice, forsaken, and most loved, despised! Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon. Be it lawful I take up what's cast away. Gods, gods, 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect, my love should kindle to inflamed respect. Thy dower-less daughter, King, thrown to my chance, is queen of us, of ours, of our fair France. Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy can buy this unprized precious maid of me. Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind. Thou losest here, a better where to find. Thou hast her, France, let her be thine, for we have no such daughter, nor shall ever see that face of hers again. Therefore be gone without our grace, our love, our benison. Come, noble Burgundy. Bid farewell to your sisters. The jewels of our father, with washed eyes Cordelia leaves you. I know you what you are, and like a sister, am most loath to call your faults as they are named. Love well our father. To your professed bosoms I commit him, but yet, alas, as stood I within his grace, I would prefer him to a better place! So farewell to you both. Prescribe not us our duties. Let your study be to content your lord, who hath received you at fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted, and well are worth the want that you have wanted. Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides. Who covers faults, at last with shame derides. Well may you prosper! Come, my fair Cordelia. Sister, it is not little I have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both. I think our father will hence tonight. That's most certain, and with you. Next month with us. You see how full of changes his age is. The observation we have made on it hath been little. He always loved our sister best, with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off appears too grossly. 'Tis the infirmity of his age. Yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself. The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash. Then must we look from his age to receive not alone the imperfections of long-ingraffed condition, but there with all the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them. Such unconstant starts are we likely to have of him as this of Kent's banishment. There is further compliment of leave-taking between France and him. I pray you, let's hit together. If our father carry authority with such disposition as he bears, this last surrender of his will but offend us. We shall further think of it. We must do something, and in the heat. Thou Nature, art my goddess. To thy law my services are bound. Wherefore should I stand in the plague of custom, and permit the curiosity of nations to deprive me, for that I am some 12 or 14 moonshines lag of a brother? Why bastard? Wherefore base? When my dimensions are as well compact, my mind as generous, and my shape as true as honest madam's issue? Why brand they us with base? With baseness? Bastardy? Base, base? Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take more composition and fierce quality than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed, go to the creating a whole tribe of fops got tween asleep and wake? Well then, Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land. Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund as to the legitimate. Fine word, "legitimate"! Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed, and my invention thrive, Edmund the base shall top the legitimate. I grow. I prosper. Now gods, stand up for bastards! Kent banished thus? And France in choler parted? And the King gone tonight, proscribed his power, confined to exhibition? All this done upon the gad? Edmund, [paper rustles] how now? What news? So please your lordship, none. Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter? [laughs] I know no news, my lord. What paper were you reading? Nothing, my lord. No? What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket? The quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself. Let's see. Come, if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles. [laughs] I beseech you, sir, pardon me. It is a letter from my brother that I have not all o'er-read, and for so much as I have perused, I find it not fit for your o'erlooking. Give me the letter, sir. I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame-- Let's see, let's see! I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote this but as an essay or taste of my virtue. "This policy and reverence of age "makes the world bitter" [reading indistinctly]. [paper rustles] "This policy and reverence of age "makes the world bitter to the best of our times, "keeps our futures from us "till our oldness cannot relish them. "I begin to find an idle and fond bondage "in the oppression of aged tyranny, "who sways, not as it hath power, but as it is suffered. "Come to me, that of this I may speak more. "If our father should sleep till I waked him, "you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, "and live the beloved of your brother, Edgar!" [gasps] Conspiracy? "Sleep till I waked him, "you should enjoy half his revenue." My son Edgar! Had he a hand to write this? A heart and brain to breed it in? When came this to you? Who brought it? It was not brought me, my lord, there's the cunning of it. I found it thrown in at the casement of my closet. You know the character to be your brother's? If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were his, but in respect of that, I would fain think it were not. It is his. It is his hand, my lord, but I hope his heart is not in the contents. Has he never before sounded you in this business? Never, my lord. But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declined, the father should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue. O villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! Worse than brutish! Go sirrah, seek him. I'll apprehend him. Abominable villain! Where is he? I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to suspend your indignation against my brother till you can derive better testimony of his intent, you should run a certain course, where, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honor, and shake in pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life for him that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your honor, and to no other pretense of danger. Think you so? If your honor judge it meet, I will place you where you shall hear us confer of this and by an auricular assurance have your satisfaction, and that with no greater delay than this very evening. He cannot be such a monster. Nor is not, sure. To his father, who so tenderly and entirely loves him. Heaven and earth! [sighs] Seek him out, Edmund. Wind me into him, I pray you. Frame the business after your own wisdom. I would unstate myself to be in a due resolution. I will seek him, sir, presently, convey the business as I shall find means, and acquaint you withal. These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us. Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects. Love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide. In cities, mutinies, in countries, discord, in palaces, treason, and the bond cracked 'twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the prediction, there's son against father. The King falls from bias of nature, there's father against child. [groans] We have seen the best of our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. Find out this villain, Edmund, it shall lose thee nothing. Do it carefully. And the noble and true-hearted Kent banished! His offense, honesty! 'Tis strange. This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are sick in fortune, often the surfeits of our own behavior, we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and stars, as if we were villains on necessity, fools by heavenly compulsion, knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance. Drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence, and all that we are evil in, by a divine thrusting on. An admirable evasion of whore-master man, to lay his goatish disposition on the charge of a star! My father compounded with my mother under the Dragon's Tail, and my nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it follows I am rough and lecherous. I should have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar, pat he comes, like a catastrophe of the old comedy. My cue is villainous melancholy, with a sigh like Tom o' Bedlam. O, these eclipses do portend these divisions! [hums] How now, brother Edmund? What serious contemplation are you in? I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other day, what should follow these eclipses. Do you busy yourself with that? I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily, as of unnaturalness between the child and the parent, death, dearth, dissolutions of ancient amities, divisions in state, menaces and maledictions against king and nobles, needless diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what. How long have you been a sectary astronomical? Come, come! When saw you my father last? The night gone by. Spake you with him? Ay, two hours together. Parted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure in him by word nor countenance? None at all. Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him, and at my entreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath qualified the heat of his displeasure, which at this instant so rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would scarcely allay. Some villain hath done me wrong. That's my fear. I pray you have a continent forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower, and, as I say, retire with me to my lodgings, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak. Pray ye, go! There's my key. [key jangles] If you do stir abroad, go armed. Armed, brother? Brother, I advise you to the best. I am no honest man if there be any good meaning toward you. I have told you what I have seen and heard, but faintly, nothing like the image and the horror of it. Pray you, away! Shall I hear from you anon? I do serve you in this business. A credulous father and a brother noble whose nature is so far from doing harms that he suspects none, on whose foolish honesty my practices ride easy! I see the business. Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit. All with me's meet that I can fashion fit. Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool? Ay, madam. By day and night, he wrongs me! Every hour he flashes into one gross crime or other that sets us all at odds. I'll not endure it. His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us on every trifle. When he returns from hunting, I will not speak with him. Say I am sick. If you come slack of former services, you shall do well. The fault of it I'll answer. [trumpets blaring] He's coming, madam, I hear him. Put on what weary negligence you please, you and your fellows. I'd have it come to question. If he distaste it, let him to my sister, whose mind and mine I know in that are one, not to be overruled. Idle old man, that still would manage those authorities that he hath given away! Now, by my life, old fools are babes again, and must be used with checks as flatteries, when they are seen abused. Remember what I have said. Well, madam. And let his knights have colder looks among you. What grows of it, no matter. Advise your fellows so. I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall, that I may speak. I'll write straight to my sister to hold my very course. Prepare for dinner. If but as well I other accents borrow, that can my speech defuse, my good intent may carry through itself to that full issue for which I razed my likeness. Now, banished Kent, if thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemned, so may it come, thy master, whom thou lovest, shall find thee full of labors. Let me not stay a jot for dinner. [stick bangs] Go get it ready. [groans] How now? What art thou? A man, sir. What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with us? I do profess to be no less than I seem, to serve him truly that will put me in trust, love him that is honest, to converse with him that is wise and says little, to fear judgment, to fight when I cannot choose, and to eat no fish. What art thou? A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the King. If thou be'st as poor for a subject as he is for a king, thou art poor enough. [laughs] What wouldst thou? Service. Who wouldst thou serve? You. Dost though know me, fellow? No, sir, but you have that in your countenance that I would fain call master. What's that? Authority. What services canst thou do? Oh, I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale in telling it, and deliver a plain message bluntly. That which ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in, and the best of me is diligence. How old are thou? Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor so old to dote on her for anything. [laughs] I have years on my back 48. Follow me, thou shalt serve me. If I like thee no worse after dinner, I shall not part from thee before. Dinner, ho, ho, ho, ho, -dinner! -[laughing] Where's my knave? My fool? Go you and call my fool hither. You, you, sirrah, where's my daughter? So please you. What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back. Where's my fool, ho, ho, ho? I think the world is asleep. [laughs] How now? Where's that mongrel? He says, my lord, your daughter is not well. Why came not the slave back to me when I called him? Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would not. He would not? My lord, I know not what the matter is, but to my judgment your Highness is not entertained with that ceremonious affection as you were wont. There's a great abatement of kindness appears as well in the general dependents as in the Duke himself also and your daughter. Nah, sayest thou so? I beseech you'll pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken, for my duty cannot be silent when I think your Highness wronged. Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception. I have perceived a most faint neglect of late, which I have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as the very pretense and purpose of unkindness. I will look further into it. But where's my fool? I've not seen him this two days. Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the fool hath much pined away-- No more of that, I've noted it well. Go you, tell my daughter I would speak with her. Go you, and call hither my fool. O, you, sir, you! [stick bangs] Come you hither, sir. Who am I, sir? My lady's father. "My lady's father"? My lord's knave! You whoreson dog, you slave, you cur! I am none of these, my lord, I beseech your pardon. Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal? [stick slaps] I'll not be strucken, my lord. Nor tripped neither, you base football player! I thank thee, fellow. Thou serv'st me, and I'll love thee. Come sir, arise, away! No! I will teach you differences. Away, away! Have you wisdom? You'll measure your lubber's length again, tarry, but away! Go to! -[yells] -Hey, hey, hey, -hey, hey! -[stick thwacks] Whoo-hoo! [laughs] Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee. Here's earnest of thy service. Let me hire him too. Here's my coxcomb. [laughs] How now, my pretty knave? How dost thou? Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb. Why, fool? Why? For taking one's part that's out of favor. Nay, and thou canst not smile as the wind sits, thou'lt catch cold shortly. There, take my coxcomb! Why, this fellow, he's banished two on's daughters, and did the third a blessing against his will. If thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb. How now, nuncle? Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters! Why, boy? If I gave them all me living, I'll keep me coxcombs meself, there's mine! Beg another of thy daughters-- Take heed, sirrah, the whip. [yells] Truth's a dog must to kennel. He must be whipped out when Lady the brach may stand by the fire and stink. A pestilent gall to me! Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech. Do, boy. Mark it, nuncle. Have more than thou showest, speak less than thou knowest, lend less than thou owest, ride more than thou goest, learn more than thou trowest, set lest than thou throwest, leave thy drink and thy whore, and keep in-a-door, and thou shalt have more than two 10s to a score. [laughs] This is nothing, fool. Then 'tis like the breath of an unfeed lawyer, you gave me nothing for it. [laughs] Why can you make no use of nothing, nuncle? Why, no, boy. Nothing can be made out of nothing boy. Well prithee tell him, so much the rent of his land comes to, he'll not believe a fool. A bitter fool! Dost know the difference, my boy, between a bitter fool and a sweet one? No, lad, teach me. That lord that counseled thee to give away thy land, come place him here by me, and do thou for him stand, the sweet and bitter fool will presently appear, the one in motley here, the other found out there. Dost thou call me fool, boy? All thy other titles thou hast given away, that thou wast born with. This is not altogether fool, my lord. No faith, no lords and great men will not let me. If I had a monopoly out, they'd have part on't. And the ladies too, they'll not let me have all the fool to meself, they'll be snatching. [yells] [laughs] Nuncle, give me an egg, and I'll give thee two crowns. What two crowns shall they be? When I've cut the egg in the middle and eat up the meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou clovest thy crown in the middle and gavest away both parts, thou borest thine ass on thy back o'er the dirt. Thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown than thy gavest thy golden one away. If I speak like meself in this, let him be whipped that first finds it so. ♪ Fools had ne'er less grace in a year ♪ ♪ For wise men are grown foppish ♪ ♪ They know not how their wits to wear ♪ ♪ Their manners are so apish ♪ When was thou wont to be so full of songs, sirrah? I have used it, nuncle, ever since thou mad'st thy daughters thy mothers [growls] for when thou gavest them the rod, and put'st down thine own breeches, ♪ Then they for sudden joy did weep ♪ ♪ And I for sorrow sung ♪ ♪ That such a king should play bo-peep ♪ ♪ And go the fools among ♪ Oh, nuncle, prithee. Keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie. I fain learn to lie. An your lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipped. I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are. They'd have me whipped for speaking true, thou'lt have me whipped for lying, sometimes I'm whipped for holding me peace. I'd rather be any kind of thing than a fool, and yet I'd not be thee, nuncle. Thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides and left nothing in the middle. Here comes one of the parings. [laughs] How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on? You're too much of late in the frown. Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care for her frowning. Now thou art an O without a figure. I am better than thou art now. I'm a fool, thou art nothing. Oh yes, forsooth, I will hold me peace, so your face bids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum, mum, mum! He that keeps nor crust nor crum, weary of all, shall want some. That's a sheal'd peascod. Not only, sir, this your all-licensed fool, but other of your insolent retinue do hourly carp and quarrel, breaking forth in rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir, I had thought, by making this well known to you, to have found a safe redress, but now grow fearful, by what yourself, too late, hath spoke and done, that you protect their course, and put it on by your allowance, which if you should, the fault would not scape censure, nor the redresses sleep, which in the tender of a wholesome weal, might in their working do you that offense, which else were shame, that then necessity will call discreet proceeding. -[groans] -For you know, nuncle, the hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long it had its head bit off by its young. So out went the candle and we were left darkling. Are you our daughter? -[laughs] -I would you would make good use of your good wisdom whereof I know you are fraught, and put away these dispositions which of late transport you from what you rightly are. May not the ass know when the cart draws a horse? Oh, whoops, Jug, I love thee! Does any here know me? This is not Lear. [laughs] Does Lear walk thus? Speak thus? Where are his eyes? [laughs] Either his notion weakens, or his discernings are lethargied. [laughs] Waking? 'Tis not so! Who is it that will tell me who I am? Lear's shadow. I would learn that, for by the marks of sovereignty, knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded I had daughters [laughs]. They will make an obedient father. Your name, fair gentlewoman? This admiration, sir, is much o' the savor of other your new pranks. I do beseech you to understand my purposes aright. As you are old and reverend, should be wise. Here you do keep a hundred knights and squires, men, so disordered, so deboshed and bold, that this our court, infected with their manners, shows like a riotous inn. Epicurism and lust makes it more like a brothel or a tavern than a graced palace. The shame itself doth speak for instant remedy. Be then designed by her that else will take the things she begs a little to disquantity your train, and the remainders that shall still depend to be such men as may besort your age, which know themselves, and you. Darkness and devils! Saddle my horses! Call my train together! Degenerate bastard, I'll not trouble thee, yet have I left a daughter. You strike my people, and your disordered rabble make servants of their betters. Woe that too late repents! O, sir, are you come? Is it your will? Speak, sir! Prepare my horses. Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend. More hideous when thou showest thee in a child than the sea monster! Pray, sir, be patient. Detested kite, thou liest! My train are men of choice and rarest parts, who all particulars of duty know and with the most exact regard support the worships of their name. O this most small fault, how ugly didst thou in Cordelia show! Which, like an engine, wrenched my frame of nature from the fixed place, drew from my heart all love and added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear! Beat at this gate that let thy folly in and thy dear judgment out! Go, go, my people. My lord, I am as guiltless as I am ignorant of what hath moved you. It may be so, my lord. Hear, Nature, hear! Dear goddess, hear! Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend to make this creature fruitful. Into her womb convey sterility. Dry up in her the organs of increase. And from her derogate body never spring a babe to honor her! If she must teem, create her child of spleen, that it may live and be a twart disnatured torment to her. Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth with cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks, turn all her mother's pains and benefits to laughter and contempt, that she may feel how sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child. Away, away! Now, gods that we adore, wherefore comes this? Never afflict yourself to know more of it, but let his disposition have that scope as dotage gives it. What, 50 of my followers at a clap within a fortnight? What's the matter, sir? I'll tell thee. Life and death I am ashamed that thou hast power to shake my manhood thus, that these hot tears, which break from me perforce, should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee! The untented woundings of a father's curse pierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes [inhales], beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out, and cast you, with the waters that you lose, to temper clay. [yells] Is it come to this? Let it be so. I have another daughter, who I am sure is kind and comfortable. When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails she'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find that I'll resume that shape which thou dost think I have cast off for ever. [footsteps stomping] Do you mark that? I cannot be so partial, Goneril, to the great love I bear you-- Oh, pray you, content. What, Oswald, ho! You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master! Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry, take the fool with thee. A fox when one has caught her, and such a daughter, should sure to the slaughter, if my cap would buy a halter. And so the fool follows after. This man hath had good counsel! A hundred knights? [laughs] 'Tis politic and safe to let him keep at point a hundred knights, yes, that on every dream, each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike, he may enguard his dotage in their powers and hold our lives in mercy. Oswald, I say! Well, you may fear too far-- [gasps] Safer than trust too far. Let me still take away the harms I fear, not fear still to be taken. I know his heart. What he hath uttered I have writ my sister. If she sustain him and his hundred knights, when I have shown the unfitness. How now, Oswald? What, have you writ that letter to my sister? Aye, madam. Take you some company, and away to horse! Inform her full of my particular fear, and thereto add such reasons of your own as may compact it more. Get you gone, and hasten your return. No, no, my lord! This milky gentleness and course of yours, though I condemn not, yet, under pardon, you are much more attacked for want of wisdom than praised for harmful mildness. How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell. Striving to do better, oft we mar what's well. Nay then. Oh, well. The event. Go you before to Gloucester with these letters. Acquaint my daughter no further with anything you know than comes from her demand out of the letter. If your diligence be not speedy, I shall be there before you. I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered your letter. If a man's brains were in his heels, were it not in danger of kibes? Ay, boy. Then prithee be merry. Thy wit shall not go slip-shod. Ha, ha, ha! Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly, for though she's as like this as a crab's like an apple, yet I can tell what I can tell. What canst tell, boy? She will taste as like this as a crab does to a crab. Canst tell why one's nose stands in the middle on's face? No. To keep his eyes on either side of his nose, that what a man cannot smell out, he may spy into. I did her wrong. Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell? No, no, no, no. No, nor I neither, but I can tell why a snail has a house. Why? Put his head in. Not to give it away to his daughters, and leave his horns without a case. I shall forget my nature. So kind a father! Be my horses ready? Thy asses are gone about them. The reason why the seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason. Because they're not eight? Yes. Yes indeed. Thou'd make a good fool. To tak't again perforce! Monster ingratitude! If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I'd have thee beaten for being old before thy time. How's that? Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise. O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven, keep me in temper. I would not be mad! How now? Are the horses ready? Ready, my lord. Come, boy. She that's a maid now, and laughs at my departure, shall not be a maid long, unless things be cut shorter. Save thee, Curan. And you, sir. Oh, I've been with your father, given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan his Duchess will be here with him this night. How comes that? Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad? Not I. Pray you, what are they? You heard of no likely wars toward 'twixt Dukes of Cornwall and Albany? Not a word. You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir. The Duke be here tonight? The better. Best. This weaves itself perforce into my business. My father hath set guard to take my brother, and I have one thing, of a queasy question, which I must act. Briefness and fortune, work! Brother, a word! Descend! Brother, I say! Come on. My father watches. O sir, fly this place! Intelligence is given where you are hid. You have now the good advantage of the night. Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall? He's coming hither now, in the night, in the haste, and Regan with him. Have you nothing said upon his party against the Duke of Albany? Advise yourself. I am sure on't, -not a word. -Shhh! I hear my father coming. Pardon me. In cunning I must draw my sword upon you. Draw, seem to defend yourself, now quit you well. -[swords clang] -Ha! Yield! Come before my father. Light, ho. Fly, brother. Torches, torches! So, farewell. [sword clatters] Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion of my more fierce endeavor. [gasps] I have seen drunkards do more than this in sport. [yells] Father, father! Stop, stop! No help? Now, Edmund, where's the villain? Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out, mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon to stand auspicious mistress. But where is he? Look sir, I bleed. Where is the villain, Edmund? Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could-- Pursue him, ho! Go after. By no means what? Persuade me to the murder of your lordship. Oh, strong and fastened villain. Would he deny his letter? I never got him. [trumpets blaring] Hark, the Duke's trumpet! I know not why he comes. All ports I'll bar, the villain shall not scape. The Duke must grant me that, and of my land, loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means to make thee capable. How now, my noble friend? Since I came hither, which I can call but now, I've heard strange news. If it be true all vengeance comes too short which can pursue the offender. How dost, my lord? O madam, my old heart is cracked, it's cracked. What did my father's godson seek your life? He whom my father named? Your Edgar? Dear, dear lady, shame would have it hid! Was he not companion with the riotous knights that tend upon my father? I know not, madam. 'Tis too bad, too bad. Yes, madam, he was of that consort. No marvel then though he were ill affected. 'Tis they have put him on to the old man's death, to have the expense and waste of his revenues. I have this present evening from my sister been well informed of them, and with such cautions that if they come to sojourn at my house, I'll not be there. Nor I, assure thee, Regan. Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father a childlike office. It was my duty, sir. He did bewray his practice, and received this hurt you see, striving to apprehend him. Is he pursued? Ay, my good lord. If he be taken, he shall never more be feared of doing harm. Make your own purpose, how in my strength you please. For you, Edmund, whose virtue and obedience doth this instant so much commend itself, you shall be ours. Natures of such deep trust shall we much need, you we first seize on. I shall serve you, sir, truly, however else. For him I thank your Grace. You know not why we came to visit you. Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night. Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise, wherein we must have use of your advice. Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister, of differences, which I best thought it fit to answer from home. The several messengers from hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend, lay comforts to your bosom, and bestow your needful counsel to our businesses, which craves the instant use. I serve you, madam. Your Graces are right welcome. [footsteps thudding] Good dawning to thee, friend. Art of this house? Ay. Where may we set our horses? In the mire. Prithee, if thou lov'st me, tell me. I love thee not. Why then, I care not for thee. If I had thee in Lipsbury Pinfold, I'd make thee care for me. Why dost thy use me thus? I know thee not. Oh, fellow, I know thee. What dost thou know me for? A knave. A rascal. An eater of broken meats. A base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave. A lily-livered, action-taking, whoreson, glass-gazing, super-serviceable, finical rogue. One-trunk-inheriting slave. One that wouldst be a bawd in way of good service, and art nothing but the composition of knave, coward, beggar, pander, and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch. And one whom I will beat into clamorous whining, if thou denyest the least syllable of thy addition. Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail upon one that is neither known of thee, nor knows thee! And what a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny thou knowest me! Is it not two days since I tripped up thy heels and beat thee before the King? Draw, you rogue! [stick bangs] For though it be night, yet the moon shines. I'll make a sop o' the moonshine of you, you whoreson cullionly barber-monger! Draw! -[stick bangs] -Away! I have nothing to do with thee. -[stick bangs] -Draw, you rascal! You come with letters against the King, and take Vanity the puppet's part against the royalty of her father, hmm? [stick bangs] Draw, you rascal [stick bangs], or I'll so carbonado your shanks! Draw, you rogue, come your ways! Help, ho! Murder! -Help! -Strike, you slave! Stand, you rogue! Stand, you neat slave! Strike! -[yells] -Help, ho! Murder! -Murder! -How now? What's the matter? -Parts. -With you, goodman boy, if you please, I'll flesh you. -Weapons, arms? -Come on, young master! Ha! What's the matter here? Keep peace, upon your lives! He dies that strikes again. What's the matter? The messengers from our sister and the King. What's your difference? Speak. I am scarce in breath, my lord. No marvel, you've so bestirred your valor. You cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee. A tailor made thee. Thou art a strange fellow. A tailor make a man? Yeah, a tailor, sir. Stone-cutter or a painter could not have made him so ill, though they been but two hours at the trade [snorts]. Speak yet, how grew your quarrel? This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared at suit of his gray beard-- Thou whoreson zed! Thou unnecessary letter! My lord, if you'll give me leave, I'll tread this unbolted villain into mortar and daub the wall of a jakes with him. Peace, sirrah! You beastly knave, know you no reverence? Oh yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege. Why art thou angry? That such a slave as this should wear a sword, who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these, renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks with every gale and vary of their master, knowing naught, like dogs, but following. A plague upon your epileptic visage! Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool? Goose, if I had you upon Sarum Plain, I'd drive ye cackling home to Camelot. What art thou mad, old fellow? How fell you out? Say that. No contraries hold more antipathy than I and such a knave. Why dost thou call him knave? What is his fault? His countenance likes me not. No more perchance does mine, nor his, nor hers. Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain. I have seen better faces in my time than stands on any shoulder that I see before me at this instant [snorts]. [laughs] This is some fellow, who having been praised for bluntness, doth affect a saucy roughness, and constrains the garb quite from his nature. He cannot flatter, he! An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth! And they will take it, so, if not, he's plain. These kind of knaves I know which in this plainness harbor more craft and more corrupter ends than 20 silly-ducking observants that stretch their duties nicely. Oh, sir, in good faith, in sincere verity, under the allowance of your great aspect, whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire on flickering Phoebus' front. What mean'st by this? To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. I know, sir, I am no flatterer. He that beguiled you in a plain accent was a plain knave, which for my part, I will not be, though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to it. What was the offense you gave him? I never gave him any. It pleased the King his master very late to strike at me, upon his misconstruction. When he, compact, and flattering his displeasure, tripped me behind. Being down, insulted, railed, and put upon him such a deal of man as worthied him, got praises of the King for him attempting who was self-subdued. And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit, drew on me here again. None of these rogues and cowards but Ajax is their fool. Fetch forth the stocks! You stubborn ancient knave, you reverent braggart. We'll teach you. Sir, I'm too old to learn. Call not your stocks for me. I serve the King, on whose employment I was sent to you. You shall do small respect, show too bold malice against the grace and person of my master, stocking his messenger. Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honor, there shall he sit till noon. 'Til noon? 'Till night, my lord, and all night too! Why madam, if I were your father's dog, you should not use me so. Sir, being his knave, I will. This is a fellow of the selfsame color our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks! Let me beseech your Grace not to do so. His fault is much, and the good King his master will check him for't. Your purposed low correction is such as basest and contemnedest wretches for pilferings and most common trespasses are punished with. The King must take it ill that he, so lightly valued in his messenger, should have him thus restrained. I'll answer that. My sister may receive it much more worse, to have her gentleman abused, assaulted, for following her affairs. Put in his legs. [stocks bang] Come, my good lord, away. I am sorry for thee, friend. 'Tis the Duke's pleasure, whose disposition, all the world well knows, will not be rubbed nor stopped. I'll entreat for thee. Pray do not, sir. I've watched and traveled hard. Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle. A good man's fortune may grow out at heels. Give you good morrow! The Duke's to blame in this. 'Twill be ill taken. Good King, that must approve the common saw, thou out of heaven's benediction comest to the warm sun! Approach, thou beacon to this under globe, that by thy comfortable beams I may peruse this letter. [paper rustles] Nothing almost sees miracles but misery. I know 'tis from Cordelia, who hath most fortunately been informed of my obscured course. [paper rustles] "And shall find time from this enormous state "seeking to give losses their remedies." All weary and o'erwatched. Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold this shameful lodging. [sighs] Fortune, good night. Smile once more, turn thy wheel. [panting] I heard myself proclaimed, and by the happy hollow of a tree escaped the hunt. No port is free, no place that guard and most unusual vigilance does not attend my taking. Whiles I may scape, I will preserve myself, and am bethought to take the basest and most poorest shape that ever penury, in contempt of man, brought near to beast. My face I'll grime with filth, blanket my loins, elf all my hairs in knots, and with presented nakedness outface the winds and persecutions of the sky. The country gives me proof and precedent of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices, strike in their numbed and mortified bare arms pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary, and with this horrible object, from low farms, poor pelting villages, sheepcotes, and mills, sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers, enforce their charity. "Poor Turlygod! "Poor Tom!" That's something yet! Edgar, I nothing am. [footsteps thudding] 'Tis strange that they should so depart from home, and not send back my messenger. As I learned, the night before there was no purpose in them of this remove. Hail to thee, noble master! Ha! Mak'st thou this shame thy pastime? No, my lord. [laughs] He wears cruel garters. Horses are tied by the head, dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by the loins, and men by the legs. When a man's over-lusty at legs, he wears wooden nether-stocks. What's he that hath so much thy place mistook to set thee here? It is both he and she, your son and daughter. No. Yes. No, I say. I say yea. No, no, they would not! Yes, they have. By Jupiter, I swear no! By Juno, I swear ay! They durst not do it. They could not, would not do it. 'Tis worse than murder to do upon respect such violent outrage. Resolve me, with all modest haste, which way thou mightst deserve or they employ this usage, coming from us. My lord, when at their home I did commend your Highness' letters to them, ere I was risen from the place that showed my duty kneeling, came there a reeking post, stewed in his haste, half breathless, panting forth from Goneril his mistress, salutations, delivered letters, spite of intermission, which presently they read, on whose contents, they summoned up their meiny, straight took horse, commanded me to follow and attend the leisure of their answer, gave me cold looks, and meeting here the other messenger, whose welcome I perceived had poisoned mine, being the very fellow which of late displayed so saucily against your Highness, having more man than wit about me, drew. He raised the house with loud and coward cries. Your son and daughter found this trespass worth the shame which here it suffers. Winter's not gone yet, if the wild geese fly that way. Fathers that wear rags do make their children blind, but fathers that bear bags shall see their children kind. Fortune, that arrant whore, ne'er turns the key for the poor. But for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year. O, how this mother swells up toward my heart! Hysterica passio! Down, thou climbing sorrow, thy element's below! Where is this daughter? With the Earl, sir, here within. Follow me not. Stay here. Made you no more offense but what you speak of? None. How chance the King comes with so small a number? [laughs] Thou hadst been set in the stocks for that question, thou'dst well deserved it. Why, fool? We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee there's no laboring in the winter. All that follow their noses are led by the eyes but blind men, and there's not a nose among 20 but can tell him that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheel runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with following, but the great one that goes upwards, let him draw thee after. When a wise man gives thee better counsel, give me mine again. And I've none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it. Where learned you this, fool? Not in the stocks, fool. [footsteps pounding] Deny to speak with me? They are sick, they are weary? They've traveled all the night? Mere fetches. The images of revolt and flying off! Fetch me a better answer. My dear lord, you know the fiery quality of the Duke. How unremovable and fixed he is in his own course. Vengeance, plague, death, confusion! Fiery? What quality? Why Gloucester, Gloucester, I would speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife. Well, my good lord, I have informed them so. Informed them? Dost understand me, man? Ay, my good lord. The King would speak with Cornwall. The dear father would with his daughter speak, commands their service. Are they informed of this? My breath and blood! Fiery? The fiery Duke? Tell the hot Duke that, no, but not yet. May be he is not well. Infirmity doth still neglect all office to which our health is bound. We are not ourselves when nature, being oppressed, commands the mind to suffer with the body. I'll forbear, and am fallen out with my more headier will, to take the indisposed and sickly fit for a sound man. Death on my state! Wherefore should he sit here? This act persuades me that this remotion of the Duke and her is practice only. Give me my servant forth. Go tell the Duke and 's wife I'd speak with them now, presently. Bid them come forth and hear me, or at their chamber door I'll beat the drum till it cry sleep to death. I would have all well betwixt you. O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down! Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels when she put 'em in the paste alive. She knapped 'em o' the coxcombs with a stick and cried "Down, wantons, down!" It was her brother that in pure kindness to his horse, buttered his hay. [footsteps pounding] Good morrow to you both. Hail to your Grace! I'm glad to see your Highness. Regan, I think you are. I know what reason I have to think so. If though shouldst not be glad, I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb, sepulchring an adultress. [foot stamps] O, are you free? Some other time for that. Beloved Regan, thy sister's naught. O Regan, she hath tied sharp-toothed unkindness, like a vulture, here! I can scarce speak to thee. Thou'lt not believe with how depraved a quality, O Regan! I pray you, sir, take patience. I have hope you less know how to value her desert than she to scant her duty. Say, how is that? I cannot think my sister in the least would fail in her obligation. If, sir, perchance she have restrained the riots of your followers, 'tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end, that clears her from all blame. My curses on her! O, sir, you are old! Nature in you stands on the very verge of her confine. You should be ruled and led by some discretion that discerns your state better than you yourself. Therefore I pray you that to my sister you do make return. [inhales] Say you have wronged her, sir. Ask her forgiveness? Do you but mark how this becomes the house. "Dear daughter, I confess that I am old. "Age is unnecessary. "On my knees I beg that you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, "and food." Good sir, no more of these unsightly tricks. Return you to my sister. Never, Regan! She hath abated me of half my train. Looked black upon me, struck me with her tongue, most serpent-like, about the very heart. All the stor'd vengeances of heaven fall on her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones, you talking airs, with lameness! -Fie, sir, fie! -Your nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty, you fen-sucked fogs, drawn by the powerful sun, to fall and blast her pride! O the blest gods! So will you wish on me when the rash mood is on. Never, Regan, thou shalt not have our curse. Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give thee o'er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce, but thine do comfort, and not burn. 'Tis not in thee to grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train, to bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes, and, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt against my coming in. Thou better knowest the offices of nature, bond of childhood, effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude. Thy half o' the kingdom hast thou not forgot, wherein I thee endowed. Good sir, to the purpose. Who put my man in the stocks? [trumpet blares] What trumpet's that? I know it as my sister's. This approves her letter, she will soon be here. Is your lady come? This is a slave, whose easy-borrowed pride dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows. Out, varlet, from my sight. What means your Grace? How came my man in the stocks, Regan? I have good hope thou didst not know on't. Who comes here? O heavens! If you do love old men, if your sweet sway allow obedience, if you yourselves are old, make it your cause! Send down, and take my part! Art not ashamed to look upon this beard? O Regan, will you take her by the hand? Why not by the hand, sir? How have I offended? All's not offense that indiscretion finds and dotage terms so-- O sides, you are too tough! Will you yet hold? How came my man in the stocks? I set him there, sir, but his own disorders deserved much less advancement. You? Did you? I pray you, father, being weak, seem so. If, till the expiration of a month, you will return and sojourn with my sister, dismissing half your train, come then to me. I am now from home, and out of that provision which shall be needful for your entertainment. Return to her, and 50 men dismissed? No, rather I abjure all roofs, and seek to wage against the enmity of the air, to be a comrade with the wolf and owl, necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her? Why, the hot-blooded France, who dowerless took our youngest born, I could as well be brought to knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg to keep base life afoot. Return with her? Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter to that detested groom. At your choice, sir. I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad. I'll no more trouble you, my child, farewell. We'll no more meet, no more see one another. [sighs] And yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter, or rather a disease that's in my flesh, which I must needs call mine. Thou art a boil, a plague sore, an embossed carbuncle in my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee. Let shame come when it will, I do not call it. I do not bid the Thunder-bearer shoot nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove. Mend when thou canst, be better at thy leisure. I can be patient, I can stay with Regan, I and my hundred knights. Not altogether so. I looked not for you yet, nor am provided for your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister. For those that mingle reason with your passion must be content to think you old, and so, but she knows what she does. Is this well spoken? I dare avouch it, sir. What, 50 followers? Is it not well? What should you need of more? Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger speak 'gainst so great a number? How in one house should many people, under two commands, hold amity? 'Tis hard, almost impossible. Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance from those that she calls servants, or from mine? Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack ye, we could control them. If you will come to me, for now I spy a danger, I do entreat you, bring but five-and-20. To no more will I give place or notice. I gave you all. And in good time you gave it! Made you my guardians, my depositaries, but kept a reservation to be followed by such a number. What, must I come to you with five-and-20, Regan? Said you so? And speak't again, my lord. No more with me. Those wicked creatures yet do look more favored when others are more wicked. Not being worst stands in some rank of praise. I'll go with thee. Thy 50 yet doth double five-and-20, and thou art twice her love. Hear me, my lord. What need you five-and-20, 10, or five, to follow in a house where twice so many have a command to tend you? What need one? O, reason not the need! Our basest beggars are in the poorest things superfluous. Allow not nature more than nature needs, man's life is cheap as beast's. Thou art a lady. If only to go warm were gorgeous, why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st which scarcely keeps thee warm. But for true need, o heavens give me that patience, patience I need! You see me here, you gods, a poor old man, as full of grief as age, wretched in both. If it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts against their father, fool me not so much to bear it tamely, touch me with noble anger, and let not women's weapons, water drops, stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags! I will have such revenges on you both as all the world shall, [feet stamping] I shall do such things. What they are yet, I know not, but they shall be the terrors of the earth! You think I'll weep. No, I'll not weep. I have full cause for weeping, but this heart shall break into a hundred thousand flaws or ere I'll weep. [thunder rumbles] O fool, I shall go mad! [thunder roars] Let us withdraw, 'twill be a storm. This house is little. The old man and his people cannot be well bestowed. 'Tis his own blame hath put himself from rest and must needs taste his folly. For his particular, I'll receive him gladly, but not one follower. So am I purposed. Where is my Lord of Gloucester? Followed the old man forth. [footsteps thudding] He's returned. The King is in high rage. Whither is he going? He calls to horse, but will I know not whither. 'Tis best to give him way, he leads himself. Hear me, my lord. Entreat him by no means to stay. Alas the night comes on, and the high winds do sorely ruffle. For many miles about there's scarce a bush. O, sir, to wilful men the injuries that they themselves procure must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors. He's 'tended by a desperate train, and what they may incense him to, being apt to have his ear abused, wisdom bids fear. Shut up your doors, my lord, 'tis a wild night. My Regan counsels well. Come, out of the storm. [thunder rumbles] [thunder roars] Who's there, besides foul weather? [Gent] One's minded like the weather, most unquietly. Where's the King? Contending with the fretful elements, bids the wind blow the earth into the sea, or swell the curled waters 'bove the main, that things might change or cease-- Sir, I do know you, and dare upon the warrant of my note commend a dear thing to you. There is division, although as yet the face of it is covered with mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall. But true it is, from France there comes a power into this scattered kingdom, who already, wise in our negligence, have secret feet in some of our best ports and are at point to show their open banner. Now, sir, to you. If on my credit you dare build so far to make your speed to Dover, you shall find some that will thank you, making just report of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow the King has cause to plain. I am a gentleman of blood and breeding, and from some knowledge and assurance offer this office to you. I will talk further with you-- No sir, no, do not. For confirmation that I am much more than my outwall, open this purse and take what it contains. If you should see Cordelia, as fear not but you shall, show her this ring, and she will tell you who that fellow is that yet you do not know. Fie on this storm! Now go seek the King. Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage! Blow! You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout till you have drenched our steeples, drowned the cocks! You sulphurous and thought-executing fires, vaunt-couriers of oak-cleaving thunderbolts, [thunder roars] singe my white head! And you, all-shaking thunder, strike flat the thick rotundity of the world, crack Nature's molds, all germains spill at once, that make ingrateful man! Nuncle! Court holy water in a dry house is better than this rain water out o' door. Good nuncle, in, ask thy daughters' blessing! Here's a night pities neither wise men nor fools. Rumble thy bellyful! Spit fire, spout rain! [thunder roars] Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters. I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness. I never gave you kingdom, called you children, you owe me no subscription. Then let fall your horrible pleasure. Here I stand your slave, a poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man. And yet I call you servile ministers, that will with two pernicious daughters join your high-engendered battles 'gainst a head so old and white as this! [laughs] O! 'Tis foul! He that has a house to put his head in has a good head-piece. No, I will be the pattern of all patience. I will say nothing. [Kent] Who's there? Marry, here's grace and a codpiece. That's a wise man and a fool. [Kent] Alas, sir, are you here? Things that love night love not such nights as these. The wrathful skies gallow the very wanderers of the night and make them keep their caves. Since I was man, such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder, such groans of roaring wind and rain, I never remember to have heard. Man's nature cannot carry the affliction nor the fear. Let the great gods, that keep this dreadful puddle o'er our heads, find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch, that hath within thee undivulged crimes unwhipped of justice. -[thunder roars] -Hide thee, thou bloody hand, thou perjured, and thou simular man of virtue that art incestuous. Caitiff, to pieces shake, that under covert and convenient seeming, hath practiced on man's life. Close pent-up guilt, rive your concealing continents, and cry these dreadful summoners grace. I am a man more sinned against than sinning. Alack, bareheaded? Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel, some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest. And repose you there, while I to this hard house, more harder than the stones whereof 'tis raised, which even but now, demanding after you, denied me to come in, return, and force their scanted courtesy. [pants] My wits begin to turn. Come on, my boy. [sniffs] How dost, my boy? Art cold? I'm cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow? [thunder rumbles] The art of our necessities is strange, that can make vile things precious. Come, your hovel. Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart that's sorry yet for thee. ♪ He that hath and a little tiny wit ♪ ♪ With a hey, ho, the wind and the rain ♪ ♪ And must make content with his fortunes fit ♪ ♪ For the rain it raineth every day ♪ True, my good boy. Come, bring us to your hovel. Here's a brave night to cool a courtesan. I'll speak a prophecy ere I go. When priests are more in word than matter, when brewers mar their malt with water, when nobles are their tailors' tutors, no heretics burned, but wenches suitors, then shall the realm of Albion come to great confusion. When every case in law is right, no squire in debt nor no poor knight, when slanders do not live in tongues, nor cutpurses come not to throngs, when usurers tell their gold in the field, and bawds and whores do churches build, then comes the time, who lives to see it, when going shall be used with feet. And this prophesy Merlin shall make, for I live before his time. Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural dealing! When I desired their leave that I might pity him, they took from me the use of mine own house, charged me on pain of perpetual displeasure neither to speak of him, entreat for him, or in any way sustain him. Most savage and unnatural-- Ssh, go to, say you nothing! There is division between the Dukes, and a worse matter than that. I have received a letter this night, 'tis dangerous to be spoken, I have locked the letter in my closet. These injuries the King now bears will be revenged home. There's part of a power already footed, we must incline to the King. I will look him and privily relieve him. Go you and maintain talk with the Duke, that my charity be not of him perceived. If he ask for me, I am ill and gone to bed. If I die for it, as no less is threatened me, the King my old master must be relieved. There are strange things toward, Edmund. Pray you be careful. [thunder roars] [grunts] Here is the place, my lord. Good my lord, enter. The tyranny of the open night's too rough for nature to endure. Let me alone. No good my lord, enter here. Wilst break my heart? I'd rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter. Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm invades us to the skin. So 'tis to thee, but where the greater malady is fixed the lesser is scarce felt. Thou'dst shun a bear, but if thy flight lay toward the roaring sea, thou'dst meet the bear i' the mouth. When the mind's free, the body's delicate. The tempest in my mind doth from my senses take all feeling else save what beats there. Filial ingratitude! Is it not as this mouth would tear this hand for lifting food to it? But I will punish home! No, I will weep no more. Such a night to shut me out! Pour on, I will endure. Such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril! Thy old kind father, whose frank heart gave all! O, that way madness lies. Let me shun that! No more of that. Good my lord, enter here. Prithee go in thyself, take thine own ease. This tempest will not give me leave to ponder on things would hurt me more. But I'll go in. In, boy. Go first. You houseless poverty. Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep. [thunder roars] Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are, that bide the pelting of this pitiless storm, how shall your houseless heads and unfed sides, your looped and windowed raggedness, defend you from seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en too little care of this. Take physic, pomp. Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel, that thou mayst shake the superflux to them and show the heavens more just-- [Edgar] Fathom and a half, fathom and a half! Poor Tom! [Fool] Nuncle, come not in here! Help me, help me! Here, give me me thy hand. Who's there? [Fool] It's a spirit! He says his name's poor Tom. [Kent] What art thou that dost grumble there in the straw? Come forth. [screams] Away! The foul fiend follows me! Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind. Humh! Go to thy cold bed, and warm thee. Didst thou give all to thy daughters, and art thou come to this? Who gives anything to poor Tom? Whom the foul fiend hath led through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlpool, o'er bog and quagmire, laid knives under his pillow and halters in his pew, set ratsbane by his porridge, made him proud of heart, to ride on a bay trotting horse over four-inched bridges, to course his own shadow for a traitor. [yells] Bless thy five wits! Tom's acold. [yells] Do de, do de, do de. Do de do. Bless thee from whirlwinds, star-blasting and taking! Do poor Tom some charity, whom the foul fiend vexes. -[laughs] -There could I have him now, and there, and there, and there [clamoring]! -[hands slapping] -What, has his daughters brought him to this pass? [wails] Couldst thou save nothing? Wouldst though give 'em all? Nay, he reserved a blanket, else had we been all shamed. Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters! He hath no daughters, sir. Death, traitor! Nothing could have subdued nature to such a lowness but his unkind daughters. [mewls] Is it the fashion that discarded fathers should have this little mercy on their flesh? [yells] Judicious punishment! 'Twas this flesh begot those -pelican daughters. -Pillicock sat on Pillicock, Pillicock, Pillicock! Cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen. Take heed o' the foul fiend, obey thy parents, keep thy words justly, swear not, commit not with a man's sworn spouse, set not thy sweet heart on proud array. Tom's acold. [wails] What hast thou been? A serving man, proud in heart and mind, that curled my hair, wore gloves in my cap, served the lust of my mistress' heart and did the act of darkness with her. Swore as many oaths as I spake words, and broke them in the sweet face of heaven. One that slept in the contriving of lust, and wak'd to do it. [laughs] Wine loved I deeply, dice dearly, and in woman out-paramoured the Turk. False of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand, hog in sloth, fox in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey. Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray thy poor heart to woman. Keep thy foot out of brothels, thy hand out of plackets, thy pen from lender's books, and defy the foul fiend. Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind [yells], say suum, mun, mun, hey. Dolphin my boy, right here, sessa, let him trot by. [wails] [thunder roars] Thou wert better in a grave than to answer with thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies. Is man no more than this? Consider him well. Thou ow'st the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep no wool, the cat no perfume. [laughs] Here's three on's are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself, unaccommodated man no more but such a poor, bare, forked animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings! Come, unbutton here. -[yelling and groaning] -[Fool] Be contended! 'Tis a naughty night to swim in. Now a little fire in a dark field were like an old lecher's heart, a small spark, the rest on's body cold. [groaning] Look, look here comes a walking fire. This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet. He begins at curfew, and walks till the first cock. He gives the web and the pin, squints the eye, and makes the harelip, mildews the white wheat, and hurts the poor creature of earth. -[wails] -How fares your Grace? What's he? Who's there? What is't you seek? [Gloucester] What are you there? Your names? Poor Tom, that eats the swimming frog, the toad, the tadpole, the wall newt and the water, that in a fury of his heart, when the foul fiend rages, eats cow dung for sallets, swallows the old rat and the ditch-dog, drinks the green mantle of the standing pool, that is whipped from tithing to tithing, and stock-punished and imprisoned, that hath had three suits to his back, six shirts to his body, horse to ride, and weapon to wear, but mice and rats, and such small deer, have been Tom's food for seven long year. Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin! [wails] Peace, thou fiend! -[wails] -What hath your Grace no better company? The prince of darkness is a gentleman! Modo he's called, and Madhu. [mewls] Our flesh and blood, my lord, is grown so vile, that it doth hate what gets it. Poor Tom's acold. -[wails] -Go in with me. My duty cannot suffer to obey in all your daughters' hard commands. Though their injunction be to bar my doors yet have I ventured to come seek you out and bring you where both fire and food is ready. First let me talk with this philosopher. [whimpers] What is the cause of thunder? Good my lord, take his offer, go into the house! [groans] I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban. What is thy study? How to prevent the foul fiend and to kill vermin. [wails] Let me ask you one word in private. Importune him once more to go, my lord. His wits begin to unsettle. Canst thou blame him? His daughters seek his death. Oh that good Kent, he said it would be thus, poor banished man! Thou sayest the King grows mad, I'll tell thee, friend, I am almost mad myself. I had a son, now outlawed from my blood. He sought my life but lately, very late. I loved him, friend, no father his son dearer. True to tell thee, the grief hath crazed my wits. What a night's this! I do beseech your Grace. -O, cry you mercy. -[screeches] Noble philosopher, your company. Tom is acold. This way, my lord, in there, fellow. -[clamoring] -Keep thee warm. Good my lord, soothe him, let him take the fellow. -[clamoring] -Take him you on. This way, this way sirrah, go along with us. -[yelling] -No words, no words! Hush. Child Rowland to the dark tower came, his word was still fie, foh, and fum! I smell the blood of a British man. I will have my revenge ere I depart this house. How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus gives way to loyalty, something fears me to think of. [thunder roars] I now perceive it was not altogether your brother's evil disposition that made him seek his death, but a provoking merit, set awork by a reprovable badness in himself. How malicious is my fortune that I must repent to be just! This is the letter he spoke of, which approves him an intelligent party to the advantages of France. O heavens, that this treason were not, or not I the detector! Go with me to the Duchess. If the matter of this paper be certain, you have mighty business in hand. True or false, it hath made thee Earl of Gloucester. Seek out where thy father is, that he may be ready for our apprehension. I will persever in my course of loyalty, though the conflict be sore between that and my blood. I will lay trust upon thee, and thou shalt find a dearer father in my love. Here is better than the open air, take it thankfully. I will piece out the comfort with what addition I can. I will not be long from you. All the power of his wits have given way to his impatience. The gods reward your kindness! Frateretto calls me, and tells me Nero is an angler in the lake of darkness. Pray, innocent, and beware the foul fiend. Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a gentleman or a yeoman. A king, a king! No, he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son, for he's a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him. To have a thousand with red burning spits come hizzing in upon 'em-- The foul fiend bites my back. He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, or horses health, a boy's love, or a whore's oath. It shall be done. I will arraign them straight. Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer. Thou, sapient sir, sit there. Now, you she-foxes! Look where he stands and glares! Want'st thou eyes at trial, madam? [laughs] Come o'er the bourn, Bessy, to me. Her boat hath a leak, and she must not speak why she dare not come over to thee. The foul fiend haunts Tom in the voice of a nightingale. Hoppedance cries in Tom's belly for two white herrings. Croak not, black angel. I have no food for thee. How do you, sir? Stand you not so amazed. [grunts] Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions-- I'll see their trial first. Bring in their evidence. Thou robed man of justice, take thy place. And thou, his yokefellow of equity, bench by his side. You are o' the commission, sit you too. Let us deal justly. Arraign her first. 'Tis Goneril. I here take my oath before this honorable assemblage, she kicked the poor King her father. Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril? She cannot deny it. Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint-stool. [laughs] And there's another, whose warped looks proclaim what store her heart is made upon. Stop her there! Arms, arms, sword, fire! Corruption in the place! False justicer, why dist thou let her scape? Bless thy wits! -[yelps] -O pity! Sir, where is the patience now that you so oft have boasted to retain? My tears begin to take his part so much they'll mar my counterfeiting. [yelps] The little dogs and all, Trey, Blanch, and Sweetheart, see, they bark at me. Tom will throw his head at them. Avaunt, you curs! [grunts] Then let them anatomize Regan. [thunder roars] See what breeds about her heart. Is there any cause in nature that make these hard hearts? You, sir, I entertain for one of my hundred. Only I do not like the fashion of your garments. You'll say they are Persian, but let them be changed. [chomping] Now good my lord, lie here and rest awhile. Make no noise, make no noise, draw the curtains. So, so, [thunder roars] We'll go to supper in the morning. And I'll go to bed at noon. Come hither, friend. Where is the King my master? Here, sir, but trouble him not, his wits are gone. Good friend, I prithee take him in they arms. I have o'er heard a plot of death upon him. There is a litter ready, lay him in't and drive toward Dover, friend, where thy shalt meet both welcome and protection. Take up thy master. If thou shouldst dally half an hour, his life, with thine, and all that offer to defend him, stand in assured loss. Take up, take up! And follow me, that will to some provision give thee quick conduct. Oppressed nature sleeps. This rest might yet have balmed thy broken sinews, which, if convenience will not allow, stand in hard cure. Come, help to bear thy master. Come, thou must not stay behind. Psst. [grunts] [Gloucester] Come, away. Away. [thunder roars] When we our betters see bearing our woes, we scarcely think our miseries our foes. Who alone suffers suffers most in the mind, leaving free things and happy shows behind. But then the mind much sufferance doth o'erskip when grief hath mates and bearing fellowship. How light and portable my pain seems now, when that which makes me bend makes the King bow. [fire crackles] He childed as I fathered! [sighs] Tom, away! [thunder roars] Mark the high noises, and thyself bewray when false opinion whose wrong thoughts defile thee, in thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee. What will hap more tonight, safe scape the King? Lurk, lurk. [blows] Post speedily to my lord your husband, show him this letter. The army of France is landed. Seek out the traitor Gloucester. Hang him instantly. Pluck out his eyes [laughs]. Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund, keep you our sister company. The revenges we are bound to take upon your treacherous father are not fit for your beholding. Advise the Duke where you're going, to a most festinate preparation. We are bound to the like. Our posts shall be swift and intelligent betwixt us. Farewell, dearest sister. Farewell my Lord of Gloucester. How now, where's the King? My Lord of Gloucester hath conveyed him hence. Some five or six and 30 of his knights, hot questrists after him, met him at a gate, who, with some other of the lord's dependents, are gone with him toward Dover, where they boast to have well-armed friends. Get horses for your mistress. Farewell, sweet lord, and sister. Go seek the traitor Gloucester, pinion him like a thief, bring him before us. Though well we may not pass upon his life without the form of justice, yet our power shall do a courtesy to our wrath, which men may blame, but not control. Who's there? The traitor? Ingrateful fox! 'Tis he. Bind fast his corky arms. What means your Graces? Good my friends, consider you are my guests. Should do me no foul play, friends. Bind him, I say. Hard, hard. O filthy traitor! [Gloucester] Unmerciful lady as you are, I am none. Villain, thou shalt find-- [Gloucester] [yells] By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done to pluck me by the beard. So white, and such a traitor! Naughty lady, these hairs which thou dost ravage from my chin will quicken and accuse thee. I'm your host. With robber's hands my hospitable favors you should not ruffle thus. What will you do. Come, sir, what letters had you late from France? Be simple-answered, for we know the truth. And what confederacy have you with the traitors late footed in the kingdom? To whose hands have you sent the lunatic King? Speak. [Gloucester] I have a letter guessingly set down, that came from one that's of a neutral heart, and not from one opposed. Cunning. And false. Where hast thou sent the King? [Gloucester] To Dover. Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charged at peril-- Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that. [Gloucester] I am tied to the stake, and I must stand the course [sobs]. Wherefore to Dover? [Gloucester] Because I would not see thy cruel nails pluck out his poor old eyes, nor thy fierce sister in his anointed flesh rest boarish fangs. But I shall see the winged vengeance overtake such children. See it shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair. Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot. [Gloucester] He that will think to live till he be old, give me some help! [screams] O cruel! O ye gods! [screams] One side will mock the other. Th'other too! [screams] If you see vengeance-- Hold your hand, my lord! [yells] I have served you ever since I was a child, but better service have I never given you than now to bid you hold. How now, you dog? -[growling] -If you did wear a beard upon your chin, I'd shake it on this quarrel. What do you mean? My villain! Then come then, and take the chance of anger. Give me thy sword. [clamoring] A peasant stand up thus? [screams] -[thuds] -[Servant] I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left to see some mischief on him. [thuds] Lest it see more, prevent it. [screams] Out! [screams] Vile jelly! [whimpers] Where is thy luster now? [gurgling] [Gloucester] All dark and comfortless! [sobs] Where's my son Edmund? Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature to quit this horrid act. Out, treacherous villain! Thou call'st upon him that hates thee. It was he that made the overtures of thy treason to us, who is too good to pity thee. [groans] [Gloucester] O my follies! Then Edgar was abused. Kind gods, forgive me that and prosper him! [sobs] Go, thrust him out at gate. Let him smell his way to Dover. [laughs] How is't you, my lord? How look you? I've received a hurt. Follow me, lady. Turn out that eyeless villain. Throw this slave upon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace. Untimely comes this hurt. Give me your arm. I'll never care what wickedness I do, if this man come to good. If she live long, and in the end meet the old course of death, women will all turn monsters. [mewls] [groans] I'll get some flax and whites of eggs to apply to his bleeding face. Now heaven help him! [groans] [birds cawing] Yet better thus, and known to be contemned, than still contemned and flattered. To be worst, the lowest and most dejected thing of fortune, stands still in esperance, lives not in fear. The lamentable change is from the best. [blows] The worst returns to laughter. Welcome then thou unsubstantial air that I embrace. The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst owes nothing to thy blasts. But who comes here? [whimpering] My father, poorly led? World, world, o world! But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee, life would not yield to age. O my good lord, I've been your tenant, and your father's tenant, these forescore years. Away, get thee away! Good friend, be gone. Thy comforts can do me no good at all. Thee they may hurt. But you cannot see your way. I have no way, and therefore want no eyes. I stumbled when I saw. Full oft 'tis seem our means secure us, and our mere defects prove our commodities. [sobs] O dear son Edgar, the food of thy abused father's wrath. Might I but live to see thee in my touch I'ld say I had eyes again. How now? Who's there? O gods! Who is't can say, "I am at the worst"? I am worse than e'er I was [sobs]. 'Tis poor mad Tom. And worse I may be yet. The worst is not so long as we can say, "This is the worst." Fellow, where goest? Is it a beggarman? Madman and beggar too. He has some reason, else he could not beg. In the last night's storm I such a fellow saw, which made me think a man a worm. My son came then into my mind, and yet my mind was then scarce friends with him. I have heard more since. [sobs] As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods. They kill us for their sport. How should this be? Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow, angering itself and others. Bless thee, master! Is it the naked fellow? Ay, my lord. Then prithee get thee gone. If for my sake thou wilt o'ertake us hence a mile or twain either way toward Dover, do it for ancient love, and bring some covering for this naked soul, which I'll entreat to lead me. Alack, sir, he is mad! 'Tis the time's plague when madmen lead the blind. Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure. Above the rest, be gone. I'll get him the best apparel that I have, come on't what will. [Gloucester] Sirrah! Naked fellow! Poor Tom's acold. I cannot daub it further. [Gloucester] Come hither, fellow. And yet I must. Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed. [sobs] [Gloucester] Dost thou know the way to Dover? Both stile and gate, horse-way and footpath. Poor Tom hath been scared out of his good wits. Bless thee good man's son, from the foul fiend! Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once [sobs]. Of lust, as Obidicut, Hobbididence, prince of dumbness, Mahu of murder, Modo of stealing, Flibbertigibbet of mopping and mowing [screams], who since possesses chambermaids and waiting women. [screeches] So bless thee master. Here, take this purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues have humbled to all strokes. That I am wretched makes thee the happier. Heavens, deal so still. Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man that slaves your ordinance, who will not see because he does not feel, feel your power quickly. So distribution should undo excess, and each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover? [sobs] Ay, master. There is a cliff, whose high and bending head looks fearfully in the confined deep. Bring me but to the very brim of it, and I'll repair the misery thou dost bear with something rich about me. From that place I shall no leading need. Give me thy hand. [panting] Poor Tom shall lead thee. Welcome, my lord. I marvel our mild husband not met us on the way. Now, where's your master? Madam, within, but never a man so changed. I told him of the army that was landed, he smiled at it. I told him you were coming, his answer was, "The worse." Of Gloucester's treachery and of the loyal service of his son, when I informed him, then he called me sot and told me I had turned the wrong side out. What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him. What like, offensive. Then shall you go no further. It is the cowish terror of his spirit, that dares not undertake. He'll not feel wrongs which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way may prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother. Hasten his musters and conduct his powers. I must change arms at home and give the distaff into my husband's hands. This trusty servant shall pass between us. Ere long you are like to hear, if you dare venture in your own behalf, a mistresses command. Wear this. Spare speech. Decline your head. This kiss, if it durst speak, would stretch thy spirits up into the air. [sighs] Conceive, and fare thee well. Yours in the ranks of death! [laughs] My most dear Gloucester! O, the difference of man and man. To thee a woman's services are due. My fool usurps my body. Madam, here comes my lord. I have been worth the whistle. O Goneril, you are not worth the dust which the rude wind blows in your face! I fear your disposition. That nature which condemns its origin cannot be bordered certain in itself. She that herself will sliver and disbranch from her material sap, perforce must wither and come to deadly use. No more, the text is foolish! Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile. Filths savor but themselves. What have you done? Tigers, not daughters, what have you performed? A father, and a gracious aged man, who's reverence even the head-lugged bear would lick, most barbarous, most degenerate, have you madded. Could my good brother suffer you to do it? A man, a prince, by him so benefited. Yet if the heavens do not their visible spirits send quickly down to tame these vile offenses, it will come. Humanity must perforce prey on itself, like monsters of the deep. Milk-livered man, that bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs, who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning thine honor from thy suffering, that not knowest fools do those villains pity who are punished ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum? France spreads his banners in our noiseless land, with plumed helm thy state begins to threat, whilst thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest "Alack, why does he so?" See thyself, devil! Proper deformity shows not in the fiend so horrid as in woman. O vain fool! Thou changed and self-covered thing, for shame! Bemonster not thy feature! Were't my fitness to let these hands obey my blood, they are apt enough to dislocate and tear thy flesh and bones. However, thou art a fiend, a woman's shape doth shield thee. Marry, your manhood, mew. What news? O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead, slain by his servant, going to put out the other eye of Gloucester. Gloucester's eyes? A servant that he bred, thrilled with remorse, opposed against the act, bending his sword to his great master, who, thereat enraged, flew on him, and amongst them felled him dead. But not without that harmful stroke which since hath plucked him after. This shows you are above, you justicers, that these are nether crimes so speedily can venge! O poor Gloucester, lost he his other eye? Both, both my lord. This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer. 'Tis from your sister. One way I like this well, but being widow, and my Gloucester with her, may all the building of my fancy pluck upon my hateful life. Another way the news is not so tart. I'll read, and answer. Where was his son when they did take his eyes? Come with my lady hither. He's not here. No, my good lord, I met him back again. Knows he the wickedness? Ay, my good lord. 'Twas he informed against him, and quit the house on purpose, that their punishment might have the freer course. Gloucester, I live to thank thee for the love thou show'dst the King, and to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend, tell me what more thou know'st. Alack, 'tis he. Why he was met even now as mad as the vexed sea, singing aloud, crowned with rank fumiter and furrow weeds, with hardocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo flowers, darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow in our sustaining corn. A century send forth. Search every acre in the high-grown field and bring him to our eye. What can man's wisdom in the restoring his bereaved sense? He that helps him take all my outward worth. There is means, madam. Our foster nurse of nature is repose, the which he lacks. That to provoke in him are many simples operative, whose power will close the eye of anguish. All blest secrets, all you unpublished virtues of the earth spring with my tears. Be aidant and remediate in the good man's distress. Seek, seek for him, lest his ungoverned rage dissolve the life that wants the means to lead it. News, madam. The British powers are marching hitherward. 'Tis known before. Our preparation stands in expectation of them. O dear father, it is thy business that I go about. Therefore great France my mourning and importunate tears hath pitied. No blown ambition doth our arms incite, but love, dear love, and our aged father's right. Soon may I hear and see him. But are my brother's powers set forth? Ay, madam. Himself in person there? Madam, with much ado. Your sister is the better soldier. Lord Edmund spoke not to your lord at home? No, madam. What might import my sister's letter to him? I know not, lady. Faith, he's posted hence on serious matter. It was great ignorance Gloucester's eyes being out, to let him live. Where he arrives he moves all hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone, in pity of his misery, to dispatch his nighted life, moreover, to descry the strength of the enemy. I must needs after him, madam, with my letter. Our troops set forth tomorrow. Stay with us. The ways are dangerous. I may not, madam. My lady charged my duty in this business-- Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you transport her purposes by word? Belike some things, I know not what. I'll love thee much, let me unseal the letter. Madam, I had rather-- I know your lady does not love her husband, I'm sure of that. And at her late being here, she gave strange eyeliads and most speaking looks to noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom. -I-- -I speak in understanding. You are, I know't. Therefore I do advise thee take this note. My lord is dead. Edmund and I have talked, and more convenient is he for my hand than for your lady's. You may gather more. If you do find him, pray you give him this, and when your mistress hears thus much from you, I pray desire call her wisdom to her. And so farewell. If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor, preferment falls on him that cuts him off. Would I could meet him, madam. I should show what party I do follow. Fare thee well. When shall I come to the top of that same hill? You do climb up it now. Look how we labor. Methinks the ground is even. Horrible steep. Hark, do you hear the sea? No, truly. Why then, your other senses grow imperfect by your eyes' anguish. So may it be indeed. Methinks thy voice is altered, and thou speak'st in better phrase and matter than thou didst. You are much deceived. In nothing am I changed but in my garments. Methinks y'are better spoken. Come on, sir, here's the place. Stand still. How fearful and dizzy it is to cast one's eyes so low. The crows and choughs that wing the midway air show scarce so gross as beetles. Halfway down hangs one that gathers sampire, dreadful trade! Methinks he seems no bigger than his head. The fishermen that walk upon the beach appear like mice, and yond tall anchoring bark, diminished to her cock, her cock, a buoy almost too small for sight. The murmuring surge that on the unnumbered idle pebble chafes cannot be heard so high. Oh I'll look no more, lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight topple down headlong. Set me where you stand. Give me your hand. You are now within a foot of the extreme verge. For all beneath the moon would I not leap upright. Let go of my hand. Here, friend, is another purse. In it a jewel well worth a poor man's taking. Fairies and gods prosper it with thee. Go then further off. Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going. Now fare ye well, good sir. With all my heart. Why I do trifle thus with his despair is done to cure it. O you mighty gods! This world I do renounce, and in your sights, shake patiently my great affliction off. If I could bear it longer and not fall to quarrel with your great opposeless wills, my snuff and loathed part of nature should burn itself out. If Edgar live, O bless him! Now, fellow, fare thee well. Gone, sir, farewell. [screams] And yet I know not how conceit may rob the treasury of life when life itself yields to the theft. Had he been where he thought, by this had thought been past. Alive or dead? Ho you, sir! Friend! Hear you, sir? Speak! Thus might he pass indeed. [groans] Yet he revives. What are you, sir? Away, and let me die. Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air, so many fathoms down precipitating, thou'dst shivers like an egg, but thou dost breathe, hast heavy substance, bleed'st not, speak'st, art sound. 10 masts at each make not the altitude which thou hast perpendicularly fell. Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again. Have I fallen or no? From the dread summit of this chalky bourn. Look up a height. The shrill-gorged lark cannot be seen or heard so far. Do but look up. Alack, I have no eyes! Is wretchedness deprived that benefit to end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort when misery could beguile the tyrant's rage and frustrate his proud will. Ah give me your arm. Up. [groans] So. How is't? Feel you your legs? You stand. Too well, too well. This is above all strangeness. Upon the crown of the cliff, what thing was that which parted from you? A poor unfortunate beggar. As I stood here below, methought his eyes were two full moons. He had a thousand noses, horns whelked and waved like the enridged sea. It was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father, think that the clearest gods who make them honors of men's impossibilities have preserved thee. I do remember now. Henceforth I'll bear affliction till it do cry out itself, "Enough, enough," and die. That thing you speak of, I took it for a man. Often 'twould say, "The fiend, the fiend," he led me to that place. Bear free -and patient thoughts. -[trumpets blare] Who comes here? [laughs] No, they cannot touch me for coining. I am the King himself. O thou side-piercing sight! Nature's above art in that respect. [hands slapping] There's your press money. That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper. Draw me a clothier's yard. Look, look, a mouse! See, see, this piece of toasted cheese will do it. [gurgles] [growls] [sniffs] [laughs] [sighs] [yells] There's my gauntlet. I'll prove it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird! I' the clout, i' the clout! [hisses] Give the word. Sweet marjoram. Pass. I know that voice. Ha! Goneril with a white beard? [yells] [laughs] They flattered me like a dog, told me I had white hairs in my beard before the black ones were there. To say "ay" and "no" to everything I said. "Ay" and "no" too was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter, when the thunder would not peace at my bidding, there I found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to, they're not men of their words. They told me I was everything. 'Tis a lie [gurgles]. I'm not ague-proof. The trick of that voice I do well remember. Is it not the King? Ay, every inch a king. When I do stare, see how the subject quakes. I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause? Adultery? [laughs] Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery? No. The wren goes to't, the small gilded fly does lecher in my sight. Let copulation thrive, for Gloucester's bastard son was kinder to his father than were my daughters got 'tween the lawful sheets. To't, luxury, pell-mell! For I lack soldiers. Behold yond simpering dame, whose face between her forks presageth snow, that minces virtue and does shake the head to hear of pleasure's name. The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to't with a more riotous appetite. Down from the waist they are Centaurs, though women all above. But to the girdle do the gods inherit, beneath is all the fiends. There's hell, there's darkness, there is the sulphurous pit, burning, scalding, stench consumption. Fie, fie, fie! [growls] Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, sweeten my imagination. There's money for thee. Oh let me kiss that hand. Let me wipe it first. [hisses] It smells of mortality. O ruined piece of nature. This great world shall so wear out to naught. Dost though know me? I remember thine eyes well enough. [screams] [laughs] Dost squiny at me? No, no, do thy worst, blind Cupid. I'll not love. [shrieks] Read thou this challenge, mark but the penning of it. [laughs] Were all thy letters suns, I could not see. I would not take this from report. It is, and my heart breaks at it. Read. What, with the case of eyes? Yea, o, ho, you're there with me. No eyes in your head, no money in your purse? [laughs] Your eyes are in a heavy case, your purse in a light. Yet you may see how this world goes. I see it feelingly. What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes with no eyes. Look with thine ears. See how yond justice rails on yond simple thief. Hark in thine ear. Change places or a handy-dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a farmer's dog bark at a beggar? Ay, sir. And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst behold the great image of authority, a dog's obeyed in office. [woofs] [laughs] Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand! Why dost thou lash that whore? Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind for which thou whip'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener. Through tattered clothes small vices do appear. Robes and furred gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold, and the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks. Arm it in rags, a pygmy's straw does pierce it. None does offend, none I say none. I'll able 'em. Take this of me, my friend, who have the power to seal the accuser's lips. [whimpering] Get thee glass eyes and, like a scurvy politician, seem to see the things thou dost not [laughs]. Now, now, now, now, now! Pull off my boots. Harder, harder! [coughs] So. O, matter and impertinency mixed! Reason in madness. [sobs] If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes. I know thee well enough, thy name is Gloucester. Thou must be patient. We came crying hither. Thou know'st the first time that we smell the air we wawl and cry. I will preach to thee. Mark. Alack, alack the day! When we are born, we cry that we are come to this great stage of fools. This is a good block. It were a delicate stratagem to shoe a troop of horse with felt. I'll put it in proof, and when I've stolen upon these son-in-laws, -then kill, kill, kill! -O, here he is! Lay a hand upon him. Sir. Your most dear daughter-- No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even the natural fool of fortune. Use me well. You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons. I'm cut to the brains. You shall have anything. No seconds? All myself? Why, this would make a man a man of salt, to use his eyes for garden waterpots, ay, and laying autumn's dust. Good sir. I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom. What! I will be jovial [laughs]. Come, come, I am a king. My masters, know you that? You are a royal one, and we obey you. Then there's life in't. And you shall get it, you shall get it by running. [laughs] A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch, past speaking of in a king! Hail, gentle sir. Sir, speed you. What's your will? Do you know aught, sir, of a battle toward? Most sure and vulgar. Everyone hears that which can distinguish sound. But, by your favor, how near's the other army? Near and on speedy foot. The main descry stands on the hourly thought. I thank you sir, that's all. Though that the Queen on special cause is here, her army is moved on. I thank you, sir. You ever gentle gods, take my breath from me. Let not my worser spirit tempt me again to die before you please. Well pray you, father. Now, good sir, what are you? A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows, who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows, am pregnant to good pity. Give me your arm. I'll lead you to some biding. Hearty thanks. The bounty and the benison of heaven to boot, and boot! A proclaimed prize! Most happy! That eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh to raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor, briefly thyself remember. The sword is out that must destroy thee. O, let thy friendly hand -put strength enough to't. -Wherefore, bold peasant, dar'st thou support a published traitor? Hence! Lest that the infection of his fortune take like hold on thee. Let go his arm. Let go, slave, or thou diest! Out, dunghill! [yells] [clamoring] [screams] Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse. If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body, and take the letters which thou find'st about me to Edmund Earl of Gloucester. Seek him out upon the English party. O untimely death! Death! I know thee well. A serviceable villain, as duteous to the vices of thy mistress as badness would desire. What, is he dead? Let's see the letter that he speaks of may be my friend. Leave, gentle wax, and manners, blame us not. To know our enemies' minds, we'd rip their hearts, their papers is most lawful. "Let our reciprocal vows be remembered. "You have many opportunities to cut him off. "If your will want not, "time and place will be fruitfully offered. "There is nothing done if he return the conqueror. "Then am I the prisoner, and his bed my jail, "from the loathed warmth whereof deliver me "and supply the place for your labor. "Your wife, so I would say, affectionate servant, Goneril." O indistinguished space of woman's will. A plot upon her virtuous husband's life, and the exchange of my brother. The King is mad. How stiff is my vile sense, that I stand up and have ingenious feelings of my huge sorrow! Better I were distract. So should my thoughts be severed from my griefs, and woes by wrong imaginations lose the knowledge of themselves. [drum beating] Give me your hand. Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum. Come, father, I'll bestow you with a friend. O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work to match thy goodness? My life will be too short and every measure fail me. To be acknowledged, madam, is o'erpaid. All my reports go with the modest truth. Nor more nor clipped, but so. Be better suited. These weeds are memories of those worser hours. I prithee put them off. Pardon, dear madam. Yet to be known shortens my made intent. My boon I make it that you know me not. Till time and I think meet. Then be it so, my good lord. How does the King? Madam, sleeps still. O you kind gods, cure this great breach in his abused nature. The untuned and jarring senses, O, wind up of this child-changed father! So please your Majesty that we may wake the King? He hath slept long. Be governed by your knowledge, and proceed in the sway of your own will. Is he arrayed? Ay, madam. In the heaviness of sleep we put fresh garments on him. Be by, good madam, when we do awake him, I doubt not of his temperance. Very well. Please you draw near. O my dear father. Restoration hang thy medicine on my lips, and let this kiss repair those violent harms that my two sisters have in thy reverence made. Kind and dear princess. Had you not been their father, these white flakes did challenge pity of them. Was this a face to be opposed against the warring winds? Mine enemy's dog, though he had bit me, should have stood that night against my fire. And wast thou fain, poor father, to hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn, in short and musty straw? Alack, alack! 'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once had not concluded all. He wakes. Speak to him. Madam, do you, 'tis fittest. How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty? You do me wrong to take me out of the grave. Thou art a soul in bliss, but I am bound upon a wheel of fire, which mine own tears do scald like molten lead. Sir, do you know me? You are a spirit, I know. Where did you die? Still, still, far wide! He's scarce awake. Let him alone a while. Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight, I'm mightily abused. I would e'en die with pity, to see another thus. I know not what to say. I will not swear these are my hands. Let's see. [gurgles] I feel this pin prick. Would I were assured of my condition! O, look upon me, sir, and hold your hand in benediction o'er me. [grunts] No, sir, you must not kneel. Pray, do not mock me. I am a very foolish fond old man, fourscore and upward, not an hour more or less, and to deal plainly, I fear I am not in my perfect mind. Methinks I should know you, and know this man, yet I am doubtful, for I am mainly ignorant what place this is, all my skill remembers not these garments, nor I know not where I did lodge last night. [weeps] Do not laugh at me. For as I am a man, I think this lady to be my child Cordelia. [sobs] And so I am! I am! Be thy tears wet? Yes, faith. [sighs] If you have poison for me, I will drink it. I know you do not love me. For your sisters have, as I remember, done me wrong. You have some cause, they have not. No cause. Am I in France? In your own kingdom, sir. Do not abuse me. Be comforted, good madam. The great rage you see is killed in him, and yet it is danger to make him even o'er the time he has lost. [sniffs] Will it please your Highness walk? [grunts] You must bear with me. Pray you now, forget and forgive. I'm old and foolish. Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain? Most certain, sir. Who is the conductor of his people? As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester. They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the Earl of Kent in Germany. Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about, the powers of the kingdom approach apace. The arbitrement is like to be bloody. Fare you well, sir. My point and period will be truly wrought, or well or ill, as this day's battle is fought. Now sweet lord, you know the goodness I intend upon you. Tell me but truly, but then speak the truth, do you not love my sister? In honored love. But have you never found my brother's way to the forfended place? No, by mine honor, madam. I never should endure her. Dear my lord, be not familiar with her. Fear me not. She and the Duke her husband! I had rather lose the battle than that sister should loosen him and me. Our very loving sister, well bemet. Sir, this I hear. The King is come to his daughter with others whom the rigor of our state forced to cry out. Where I could not be honest, I never yet was valiant-- Why is this reasoned? Combine together 'gainst the enemy. For these domestic door particulars are not the question here. Well let's then determine with the ancient of war on our proceeding. Sister, you'll go with us? No. 'Tis most convenient. I pray you'll go with us. O, ho, I know the riddle. I will go. If e'er your Grace had speech with man so poor, hear me one word. I'll overtake you. Speak. Before you fight the battle, ope this letter. If you have victory, let the trumpet sound for him that brought it. Wretched though I seem, I can produce a champion that will prove what is avouched there. If you miscarry, your business of the world hath so an end, and machination ceases. Fortune love you! Stay till I have read the letter. I was forbid it. When time shall serve, let but the herald cry, and I'll appear again. Oh, fare thee well. I will look your paper. The enemy's in view, draw up your powers. Here is the guess of their true strength and forces by diligent discovery, but your haste is now urged on you. We will greet the time. To both these sisters have I sworn my love. Each jealous of the other as the stung are of the adder. Which of them shall I take? Both? One? Or neither? Neither can be enjoyed, if both remain alive. To take the widow exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril, and hardly shall I carry out my side, her husband being alive. Now then, we'll use his countenance for the battle, which being done, let her who would be rid of him devise his speedy taking off. As for the mercy which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia, the battle done, and they within our power, shall never see his pardon, for my state stands on me to defend, not to debate. [trumpet blasts] Away, old man, give me thy hand, away! King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter taken. Give me thy hand! Come on! No further, sir. A man may rot even here. What? In ill thoughts again? Men must endure their going hence, even as they're coming hither. Ripeness is all. Come on. And that's true too. Some officers take them away. Good guard until their greater pleasures first be known that are to censure them. We are not the first who with best meaning have incurred the worst. For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down. Myself could else outfrown false Fortune's frown. Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters? No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison. We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage. When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down and ask of thee forgiveness. And so we'll live and pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh at gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues talk of court news, and we'll talk with them too. Who loses and who wins, who's in, who's out, and take upon's the mystery of things, as if we were God's spies. And we'll wear out, in a walled prison, packs and sects of the great ones that ebb and flow by the moon. Take them away. Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia, the gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee? He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven and fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes. The goodyears shall devour them, flesh and fell, ere they shall make us weep! We'll see 'em starved first. Come. Come hither, Captain, hark. Take thou this note. Go follow them to prison. One step I have advanced thee. If thou dost as this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way to noble fortunes. Know thou this, that men are as the time is. To be tender-minded does not become a sword. Thy great employment will not bear question. Either say thou'lt do't, or thrive by other means. I'll do it my lord. About it, and write happy when th'hast done. Mark, I say, instantly, and carry it so as I have set it down. I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats. If it be man's work, I'll do it. Sir, you have showed today your valiant strain, and fortune led you well. You have the captives who were the opposites of this day's strife. I do require them of you, so to use them as we shall find their merits and our safety may equally determine. Sir, I thought it fit to send the old and miserable King to some retention and appointed guard, whose age had charms in it, whose title more, to pluck the common bosom on his side and turn our impressed lances in our eyes which do command them. With him I sent the Queen, my reason all the same, and they are ready tomorrow, or at further space, t'appear where you shall hold your session. Sir, by your patience, I hold you but a subject of this war, not as a brother. That's as we list to grace him. Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded ere you spoke so far. He had led our powers, bore the commission of my place and person, the which immediacy may well stand up and call itself your brother. Not so hot! In his own grace he doth exalt himself more than in your addition. In my rights by me invested, he compeers the best. That were the most if he should husband you. Jesters do oft prove prophets. Holla, holla! That eye that told you so looked but asquint. Lady, I am not well, else I should answer from a full-flowing stomach. General, take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony, dispose of them, of me, the walls is thine. Witness the world that I create thee here my lord and master. Mean you to enjoy him? The letter alone lies not in your good will. Nor in thine, lord. Half-blooded fellow, yes. Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine. Stay yet, hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee on capital treason, and in thy attaint, this gilded serpent. For your claim, fair sister, I bar it in the interests of my wife. 'Tis she is subcontracted to this lord, and I, her husband, contradict your banes. If you would marry, make your love to me, my lady is bespoke. An interlude! Thou art armed, Gloucester. Let the trumpet sound. If none appear to prove upon thy person thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons, there is my pledge! I'll make it on thy heart, ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less than I have here proclaimed thee. Sick, O, sick! If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine. There's my exchange. What in the world he is that names me traitor, villain-like he lies. Call by thy trumpet. He that dares approach, on him, on you, who not? I will maintain my truth and honor firmly. A herald, ho! Trust to thy single virtue, for thy soldiers, all levied in my name, have in my name took their discharge. My sickness grows upon me. She is not well. Convey her to my tent. Come hither, herald. Let the trumpet sound, and read out this. "If any man of quality or degree "within the lists of the army will maintain upon Edmund, "supposed Earl of Gloucester, "that he is a manifold traitor, "let him appear by the third sound of the trumpet. "He is bold in his defense." Sound! [trumpet blares] Again! [trumpet blares] Again! [trumpet blares] Ask him his purposes, and why he appears upon this call of the trumpet. What are you? Your name? Your quality? And why you answer this present summons? Know my name is lost. By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit. Yet am I noble as the adversary I come to cope. Which is that adversary? What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester? Himself. What say'st thou to him? Draw thy sword, that if my speech offend a noble heart, thy arm may do thee justice. Here is mine. Behold, it is the privilege of mine honors, my oath and my profession. I protest, Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence, despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune, thy valor and thy heart, thou art a traitor, false to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father, conspirant 'gainst this high illustrious prince, and from the extremest upward of thy head, to the descent and dust below thy foot, a most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou "no," this sword, this arm, and my best spirits are bent to prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak, thou liest. In wisdom I should ask thy name. But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike, and that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes, what safe and nicely I might well delay by rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn. Back do I toss those treasons to thy head, with the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart, which for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise, this sword of mine shall give them instant way where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak! [trumpets blare] Fight. [swords clang] [thuds] [shouts] [shouts] [shouts] [clamoring] Save him, save him! [sobs] This is practice, Gloucester. By the laws of war, thou wast not bound to answer an unknown opposite. Thou art not vanquished, but cozened and beguiled. Shut your mouth, dame, [paper rustling] or with this paper shall I stop it. Hold, sir. Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil. No tearing, lady! I perceive you know it. Say if I do, the laws are mine, not thine. Who can arraign me for it? Most monstrous! O knows't thou this paper? Ask me not what I know. [yells] Go after her. She's desperate. Govern her. What you have charged me with, that have I done, and more, much more. The time will bring it out. 'Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou that hast this fortune on me? If thou art noble, I do forgive thee. I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund. If more, the more thou hast wronged me. My name is Edgar and thy father's son. The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices make instruments to plague us. The dark and vicious place where thee he got cost him his eyes. Th'hast spoken right, 'tis true. The wheel is come full circle, I am here. Methought thy very gait did prophesy a royal nobleness. I must embrace thee. Let sorrow split my heart if ever I did hate thee or thy father! Worthy prince, I know't. Where have you hid yourself? How have you known the miseries of your father? By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale, and when 'tis told, O that my heart would burst! The bloody proclamation to escape that followed me so near, O, our lives' sweetness, that with the pain of death hourly would die, rather than die at once, led me to move into a madman's rags, to assume a semblance that very dogs disdained, and in this habit met I my father with his bleeding rings, their precious stones new lost. Became his guide, led him, begged for him, saved him from despair. Never, O fault, revealed myself unto him until some half hour past, when I was armed, not sure, though hoping of this good success, I asked his blessing, and told him all my pilgrimage. But his flawed heart, alack, too weak the conflict to support, twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief, burst smilingly. Help, help, O, help! What kind of help? Speak, man. What means this bloody knife? 'Tis hot, it smokes, it came even from the heart of, she's dead! Who dead? Speak, man? Your lady, sir, your lady! And her sister by her is poisoned, she confesses it. I was contracted to them both. All three now marry in an instant. Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead. This judgment of the heavens, which makes us tremble, touches us not with pity. Here comes Kent. O, is this he? The time will not allow the compliment which very manners urges. I am come to bid my King and master aye good night. Is he not here? Great thing of us forgot. Speak, Edmund, where's the King? And where's Cordelia? Edmund was beloved. The one the other poisoned for my sake, and after slew herself. I pant for life. Some good I mean to do, despite of mine own nature. Quickly send, be brief in it, to the castle, for my writ is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia. Nay, send in time. Run, run, run-- To who, my lord? Who has the office? Send thy token of reprieve. Well thought on. Take my sword. Give it to the Captain. Haste thee for thy life. He hath commission from thy wife and me to hang Cordelia in the prison and to lay the blame upon her own despair that she fordid herself. The gods defend her. Bear him hence awhile. Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones. Had I your tongues and eyes, I'd use them so that heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever! I know when one is dead, and when one lives. She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking glass. If that her breath should mist or stain the stone, why then she lives. Is this the promised end? Or image of that horror? Fall and cease! This feather stirs, she lives! If it be so, it is a chance which does redeem all sorrows that ever I have felt. O my good master! Prithee away! 'Tis noble Kent, your friend. A plague upon you, murderers, traitors, all! I might have saved her, now she's gone for ever! Cordelia, Cordelia, stay a little. Ha! What is't thou say'st? Her voice was ever soft, gentle, and low, an excellent thing in a woman. [hands slapping] I killed the slave that was a hanging thee. 'Tis true, my lords, he did. Did I not, fellow? I have known the day, with my good biting falchion, I'd have made 'em skip. [pants] I'm old now, and these same crosses spoil me. Who are you? Mine eyes are not o' the best, I'll tell you straight. If fortune brag of two she loved and hated, one of them we behold. This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent? The same. Your servant, Kent. Where is your servant, Caius? He's a good fellow. He'll strike, and quickly too. He's dead and rotten. No, my good lord, I am the very man. I'll see that straight. That from your first of difference and decay have followed your sad steps. You're welcome hither. Nor no man else! All's cheerless, dark, and deadly. Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves, and desperately are dead. Ay, so I think. He knows not what he says, and vain is it that we present us to him. Very bootless [weeps]. Edmund is dead, my lord. That's but a trifle here. You lords and noble friends, know our intent. What comfort to this great decay may come shall be applied. [hand slapping] For us, we will resign. During the life of this old Majesty, to him our absolute power, you to your rights, with boot, and such addition as your honors have more than merited. All friends shall taste the wages of their virtue, and all foes the cup of their deservings. [sobs] My poor fool is hanged! No, no, no life. Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life, and thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more. Never, never, never, never! [gasps] Pray you undo this button. [growls] Thank you, sir. Do you see this? Look on her! Look! Her lips! Look there, look there! He faints! My lord, my lord! Break, heart, I prithee break! Look up, my lord. Vex not his ghost. O let him pass! He hates him that would upon the rack of this tough world stretch him out longer. He is gone indeed. The wonder is, he hath endured so long. He but usurped his life. Bear them from hence. Our present business is general woe. Friends of my soul, you twain rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain. I have a journey, sir, shortly to go. My master calls me, I must not say no. The weight of this sad time we must obey, speak what we feel, not what we ought to say. The oldest have borne most, we that are young shall never see so much, nor live so long. [drum beats]
