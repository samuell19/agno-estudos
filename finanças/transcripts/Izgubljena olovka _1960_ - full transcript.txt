My school. Here, in this little wooden building, first time in my life I have opened a school register. And here, because of my mistake, I have one kid... Who is in the wrong, and why that is, you will judge yourself. I will only tell you how it went. So everything will be clearer, I will start with my first meeting with the boy. Since the first day I have arrived at this school. What do we have for homework? Did we just know each other? Will we have the old timetable? I will say that tomorrow, when all other students can hear it. Hurry home Dikan, your friends are already off. So, how do you like the kids? They are still tied to you. And imagine now that someone says I am not a good pedagogue. By the way, that kid is kind of weird. He already cares about homework. - That's just how he is. Three flowers? - Six. Correct! Two cats? - Four. And two more? - Six. Very good, kids! Be careful you from first grade, look at the board well, and write down everything nice and correct. Did you understand? - We did. And you from third grade, did you prepare your books? We did. - You will then draw this object. Do you see it well? - Can you raise it a bit? Just a little bit! Here. Now you will all... Excuse me. - See it well. Can you check if I wrapped the books correctly? Please go find a better time to ask me that. Kids, pay attention when drawing this. At the top and the bottom it is thinner, in the middle it is the widest. Also, take a good look at the handle and the neck. Did you understand? - We did. When did you say was the deadline to learn "Winter song"? Are you really that forgetful? For tomorrow. I already learned it! You are a hardworking student, Dika. Go on now and start drawing. No, I didn't like Dika from the start. I preferred the kids for which commitment I had to fight. Dika was boring to me, and I didn't like that he was so careless, so he already tied to me and forgot about Ivana. Teacher! I don't have a pencil. My father will go down to the town to buy me. Come. Take this. See, I am writing with the teacher's pen. - So what, she didn't gift it to you. Always write from line to line. Did you get it? - I did! First graders, leave your books and pencils on the table, we will continue with writing. Give it to me! - Come on. Dika! I'm coming! - Hurry up, we will miss the break. Hurry, Dika! Pull! We will do it. Why did you run away when you are smaller? Pull! Did you accidentally take my pen? I don't have it. - Where is it? Is it on your table? It isn't here. - Dika, can you check if my pen fell? It's not here. Why are you talking? - I can't find my pen. I left it on your table, it is around there somewhere. We already looked. (crying): Teacher, I can't go home without my pen. His dad already once scolded him when he lost his pen. Come on kids, look around a little better. You always keep me in here about something. It isn't anywhere. Alright, I will give you my pen. I gave it to you. Who can lend Vule a pen? We will look for his after the class. Did one of you accidentally take Vule's pen? I didn't! - Me neither. What will we do with his pen? - Yes, I have at home a new pen. Or put it in their bag by accident. All of you from third grade, look carefully. Look where Vule is and where we are! - It sure isn't on me! What color was your pen, Vule? - Blue. If I remember correctly, it wasn't big. Around half the size of a new one. Don't cry, kid. What is that, kids? The pen couldn't have disappeared by itself. Don't make me have to look. When I return in five minutes, you better make sure the pen is on my table. I won't ask who took it. The one who took it should return it immediately! They should search us all and see who had it. What are you talking about, why should we have to say please to a thief? Where is the pen? Where is the pen? Search us, teacher! I don't have to search you, I know who has it. Other people's things, even small ones, are only taken by naughty children. It would the better for you to feel sorry and return the other's pen. Who is she talking to? - I don't know. I will leave you five more minutes to think about it. And don't act like you don't know that I am talking to you! I certainly know that the pen is on you. I am speaking to the one that I should. A minute has already passed! The sooner you turn yourself in, the better for you. Only two more minutes. Just one minute left. Stand up, right now! What is going on in here? Sit down, everyone. Don't ask. If only one kid rose up, I would blame them. What are you talking about? - Vule lost his pen, so I am trying to find who took it. I thought she really knew, but it turns out she doesn't either! I thought she was looking at me the whole time! If only I knew who stole it! We will search you. - Enough with the searching! We want a search! We want a search! No, kids. I will buy Vule a new pen. Why would I search all you good kids because of one that made a mistake? It can't be like that! - We want to find out who did it! Alright, so be it. We will start with the first row. Be careful you all so that someone doesn't put it on you. Vida, come and help me. Let me see, maybe it is in your boots! - If you want, I will take them off. Look, teacher. Alright, go then. Dragan and Dika, come here. She hasn't found it yet. - Who might have it? Second and fourth year, hurry to your classroom. Let's see you too. Here is the pen that you gave me. Next. Is it found? What do you think Vida, where could that pen be? Look inside the desks once more. Teacher! See where he hid it! Dika... Will we call him back? - We won't tell anyone where we found it. Why? This time you will have to be quiet. That will remain your secret. Go and call your class back. And don't yo-! - I won't, I won't. Come in. Sit down. Come and check if this is your pen. Mine! Take it away. Tell me who is it! Kids, I won't tell you who took the pen, because I hope he figured out that he made a mistake and that he won't ever do it again. Come on, tell us! - Yes, tell us! It is enough that he knows I found him. There you go kids, did I tell you I would find the culprit? You did! And have I found him? You did! You did, but who removed the covers? Our Vida even outsmarte- VIDA! But teacher, that was my pencil! Can you believe this? How can he say it was his pen when it was Vule's pen! And why would he hide his pen and- - And inside me rose a revolt for the boy. And instead of scolding Vida, I let her go at her talking. I saw it with my own eyes, but when he is so bold and won't admit, and it is obvious! Last night my father brought it to me from the town, I swear on my eyes teacher. Your father bought you half a pen! Where can you find that? He did. Bought it and split it in half so if I lose one I would have the other. Then go and bring here the second half right now. My father went to Čačak. - It's Vule's blue pen, what more is there to talk about? Teacheeeeeer... Try to be kind and smart, Dika. You are now lying on top of everything! Who steals, also lies! That was my pen. Oh, is he cunning! Listen up, instead of admitting to your wrongdoing, you are only worse and worse! Don't make me laugh! Enough! Stop with that crying. And now, explain to us, Dika, why did you tell us this morning that you don't have a pencil? Why did you write with my pen? Stand up when you're talking to me! Why did you write with my pen? So, whose pencil was the one that we found? Mine. Sit down! Go home now. Come on, can't you see they already went? There is Dika! Look at him! We won't let him hang out with us! We don't need him! We really don't! (singing) Hey, kid! Are you Dikan? - Yes. Tell your father when he returns from Čačak that Mister Tadija looked into that seed. They say that it will be. - He will come back in a week, I will tell him. Goodbye. - Farewell, kid. What do you think, where did I find the pen? Dikan. - Someone already told you. Nobody told me, I realised it by the look on your face. How is that? I brought wood and water. Do you need anything else? - Nothing more, Toma. Here is the grocery list. - Well, goodbye then. Bye, Toma. - Toma! See if the New Year masks came into town. Alright. We will have to go down there in time to buy it, or the other schools will take it all. By the way, by what look did you realise that it was Dikan? I saw that you don't stand that kid, and you almost looked happy that it was him. I'm not happy that the kid made a mistake, I just want you to realise that he isn't all that nice and good. He isn't bad, Marija. He is around you too much but that's just the nature of him. He wants for you to notice him too, otherwise you wouldn't see him from those loud ones. What you're saying is, he stole so I would notice him. It is weird that he did that, I admit. But, he is till a kid. That's what he wants you to think. If only you saw how well he pretends. If you saw those tears. - Maybe he really didn't take it. It was so obvious. Move so I can sit there. - You won't sit with me! I told you to move! Don't let him! Sit down. First graders, take out math. And third graders, homework. Why aren't you sitting down? The won't let me. Move, Dragan! Move, Dragan! You must not be rotten, kids. Be friends. And believe, he won't do it again. I, for instance, believe that it happened to him on accident. Nothing even happened to me. That is my pen. Is that how he grieves? You shouldn't be happy that Dika makes mistakes, Velibor. We need to help him, so he can see that taking other's things isn't nice. Like I don't know. I didn't steal it. - Then where is Vule's pen? Why would I care where it is? The one you gave him is mine. How are you not ashamed to talk like that? He is so insolent. What are you making a fool out of yourself for? Enough! I don't want to hear a single word! Why didn't you write down the math problem? I couldn't. - Why? You took my pen. I don't know why, but I didn't tell Ivana about the photograph incident. Marija! What is it? You didn't give the kids the mark to start! It would be better for the pigs to come out! Go behind the abacus! Fast! When I show you my back, jump out quickly! ♪ I will eat them all nicely, all nicely, all nicely. ♪ Dika! ♪ My dear brothers, you are looking at him now! ♪ ♪ This fellow is such a scum! ♪ ♪ This fellow is such a scum! ♪ Such a scum! Hey kid, what are they doing? - They want to decorate the tree. That's what's done for New Year. We learned about the Christmas tree in school. But that one was small, small... This one is big! It will have a lot of shiny decoration! And Santa will come to give us candy. Dika has been really talking a lot lately, huh? I knew it would be like that! By the way kid, what is that? Is this good? It is, you just have to spread it out better. I found a pen, teacher. Where are those scissors teacher? I can't find them anywhere. Could they be in your lap? How would you find them when it is all chaos in here! Huh! Here they are. Funny how a person can stare right at it and not see it! Toma, where did you find this pen? Here. How? Where? It fell between the wood. It was either Vule's or Dragoš's. But rather Vule, since the crack is on his side. In here. What are you doing here? I'm keeping the cookies safe. Waiting for the teacher Ivana. Go on, and don't worry about the cookies. Tell me Vule, did you lose your pen again? I can't lose it, my dad sewed it on me. Alright, it's great you didn't lose it. Hurry home now. Marija! And why isn't there a New Year's Eve in school for older people too? I don't know, it's alright, let me go! The whole world tells the New Year's Eve for older people is after the kids'. I tell you that it's not. The older people just have to come and bring us home. It's alright! - Hold on a little, let the teachers see that we also know how to dress up nicely! Wait for me to bring you your šubara. - Hurry up now so that he isn't late. Do I have to come to school to pick you up tonight? You promised me that I could spend the night at my aunt's. Alright then, hurry up son. And tell the teachers we said hello! - Goodbye. What is up with our kid? Hurry! What is that? - Who is there? I'm sure there is something there, I will go check it out. Oh, it's Dika! What is he doing? - Heh, classic Dika. Is that Vule's pen? What are you laughing at him for? - He is always crying. Grga, we won't bother him anymore. Come with my, if someone says something I will beat him up. I won't. I didn't even depart to school. - And where have you departed? Nowhere. I went out on a walk. - And why don't you want to go to school? Just because. - And why did you dress up? Come on dude, don't be crazy, you're going with us. And don't mention what happened. - I swear it must have been the wind or something. - It was a mouse, I saw one! Come on you all, Dika and I will follow you. Come on. - Catch up with them! Will the two of us gentlemen set on slowly? What do I do if he doesn't come? Kids, did any of you see Dika? - I didn't. Me neither. - Good evening. Hello, hello. Everyone already came, why did you wait for the dark? It's not dark at all. - Our houses are far away in the village. Kids, did you see Dika anywhere? - He is on the way. Hurry up kids, hurry up, Good evening! Hurry up, don't make us be late because of you. And you, don't spoof around! We should also get ready! - Are we starting soon? Yes, Toma, as soon as Dika gets here. Be in the hallway and tell me. Don't let the kids get out into the hallway, and when Dika comes close the door, who came came. Don't worry! Chill down man, everything came and went! Now nobody will believe that I'm not a thief. I know you're not, but it would be better if you wouldn't tell it like that. Not everyone will believe you like me. Let me tell you something as a homie, it would be better for you to go and tell your teacher: "Yes, I took it but I won't anymore." If the word got out that you admitted like that... understand, everyone makes fun of you for that, man. How could I admit when I didn't? I know, but admit even if you didn't, tell them you took it. When the word gets out you told it like that, nobody will say even a word anymore. Just, the next time... Toma! - Oy! Did he come? - He didn't. He still isn't here? - Duh, I will tell you. Did you remember who gives what to whom? Don't you worry, we just need Toma to give us the mark. Why is our teacher still not dressing up? He has arrived, but he won't come in. If you just keep standing there it's like you're in the trash can. She will think of you as a nothing! Dika! Dika! Dika. What is wrong? Did you want to tell me something? I admit I took it. Took what? - The pen. Vule's? - Yes. Are you sure you took it? Marija! Come on, hurry to the hall. Where is our teacher? - You are all ready? Boots first. - I will get the boots, you fix the hair. Do you know what Dika just told me? "I admit I took Vule's pen." Oh, what the hell now. Did I tell you Dika, that when you admit, everything will be good! Now Dika will go with us everywhere, right? Of course, who else! Well yes, Dika is our friend! What are they talking about over there? - Dika admitted for your pen. What, what, what was that? Dika admitted for Vule's pen. Don't touch him anymore. It started snowing! Peace, kids, be quiet! Sit down on your seats! There, from the faraway lands, Santa came to us too! I don’t want to see- Welcome, Santa! Man, he really came! - Come on, it's like you can't recognise that it's Mister Radoje! I got tired! I had to go to so many schools! And give kids the presents! And where are our presents? Nowhere? The sleigh in front of the school is full! When I give the mark to my friends, they will bring the presents in. And until then, let us talk a little. I hope that, for New Year, you are lively and joyful. We are! - We are, Santa! Mister Radoje isn't this fat! Oh, kids, I am joyful too. I'm just not as lively as you. I'm so old, so old! But, don't worry about that. Be lively and happy! Thank you, Santa! Thank you! Now, please, listen to me carefully. I asked you, and you told me, you were going into the new year lively and joyful. I know that, one kid among you, didn't tell the truth! Who is that? I still don't know. His teacher just told me: "Please Santa, when you see, among the kids, a boy with a sad look, know that it's him. Help him, so that he can also wait for the New Year joyful." If you would only help me find that boy. Look around each other,. who here has a sad face? Who is he talking to? - What is this? Slow down, kids. Slow down. Why won't he come to my by himself? Santa will help everyone who is in the right. Santa protects and loves good children. I must look for him by myself! He doesn't trust Santa, but when Santa says he will help the righteous, he keeps his promise! He is around here somewhere. Why are you, good kid, hiding! Is that Dika? Come to your Mr. Claus! He will help you! Come on, get up! - Get up when he is calling you! Don't be scared, good kid. Santa wants to make you happy! What is your name? Dika. My boy, my good boy... You can't even grasp, what you did to him! You made him a bad guy! And that teacher of yours- made him seem like... he did something he didn't do! When did we make him a bad guy? For some stupid pen! - How did we make him a bad guy? He didn't take the pen, I swear on my-I swear on my beard! He admitted it! Admitted, so that you would let him be! There you all went, there! What is this now? He took it! He took it, what is there to say! Santa, we have already forgiven him for that! Slow down people, what is there to be or not to be? There he is, so he can tell if he took it. Dika, Dika, say, did you take the pen? - Say it freely. Santa won't let them get to you. I don't know. How can you not know? - He knows, he didn't take it. He is just scared to say it. Call me the school janitor! - Here I am. Where did you find this pen? When I was cleaning the floor of the first and third grade classroom, I saw it in-between the planks. - In which place? The place where Vule sits. He probably lost it from there. Here you go, my boy. Vule has been writing with yours, so it is fair that you write with his. Cry, my dear kid, cry. It wasn't easy for you. Cry. That's how Dika also happily celebrated the New Year's Eve. The only thing left was the question: What would happen if the pen wasn't found? The End. Subtitles by atanasije
