switch to autopilot autopilot [Music] that was a close one i think this calls for a little celebration not again sir why not don't you think you're overdoing it a little the only way to stay sane in this infernal spacecraft yeah actually this is a toast gonna be my last flight it's ridiculous to go flying around the stars at my age what you're not thinking of retiring this life's a just routine it simply lost all its fascination you've got to know when it's time to quit you know it isn't easy for any of us sir but drinking is no way to solve your problems captain [Music] here put these stats through to command central and calculate our eta okay [Music] honestly what's the point of having a family if you never see them hang in there marianne this is your daddy's last flight then i'll be home for good my darlings [Music] captain i don't feel like talking what you said before about retiring did you really mean it [Music] what is it rocky something funny is going on i've got all kinds of radio interference i'll come in and check it [Music] ken [Music] mama [Music] [Applause] [Music] the rangers well what do you know so they think they can blow me out of the sky ah this lever is stuck [Music] something's wrong i can't get it under control [Music] oh no i don't want to die in the middle of nowhere [Music] that's an alien sound [Music] an enemy signal they think they can kill me so easily well they're in for a little surprise i'm a ranger too i'm a star wolf it's my only chance i'm gonna have to bail out [Music] what do you suppose that was captain what's happening here easy tammy uh-huh that was no meteor right spaceship just blew up rocky turn on the radiation deflector yes sir deflector operating sir that explosion sent out powerful magnetic fields it could destroy our spacecraft if we're not careful so stay on the alert yes sir looks like we're out of danger now uh-huh captain what's that out there [Music] that looks like a man floating through space you're right [Music] you must have bailed out of that ship before it exploded looks like he's still breathing rocky yes sir we're going to rescue him i don't think that's a very good idea why don't we just leave well enough alone don't say that he isn't even wearing a spacesuit no way he could have survived out there he could have dan what is our mission if not to save lives you know she's right okay let's go for it rocky [Music] yes sir [Music] that's not the wolf attacker who could it be [Music] maybe it's an earthship if it is i've had it [Music] he's alive all right i don't get it nobody could have survived that explosion you're right any normal human being would have been blown to bits he's coming too hello friend welcome to the earth's oldest spaceship backers three my name is joe and this is my crew how did you ever survive that crash watch it ken this might be a trap you sure took your chances out there without a spacesuit or did your space suit explode as well i just don't get it listen i'll answer that sir this is back as three over this is space control the wolf raiders from valmestar have been attacking the earth they seem to be regrouping but they're likely to come back all spaceships on route mms 600 beyond the alert [Music] can't afford to lose control [Music] oh i've got a couple of questions who are you yeah and why did you react that way when you heard the word wolf huh and where did you get all your strength you'd better tell us the truth fella i'm an astronomer i was doing scientific work huh you're hitting me let go i heard about the wolf raiders on my radio that's why i reacted i think he's telling us the truth sir i don't want to get killed captain ufos on our radar screen what check it yes sir let's go right [Music] listen to me i don't want you to move from this spot unless of course you feel like leaving this ship and floating in space [Music] you keep your eyes on the screen yes sir [Music] all instruments operational yes sir we're approaching root mms 600 sir wow look how fast they're going who can generate that kind of velocity wolf raiders for sure sir i don't think we're any match for them look at that change course you can't take them on in this beat up old crate change course someone put a gag in his mouth cut that out talking sense for once they have greater firing power the ship is much too old to take on superior forces like wolf raiders it's too late to turn around now i think they've spotted our position gonna come this is it [Music] they've got us surrounded not finished yet don't try it sir there's no way we can match their speed [Music] any faster in this ship will be torn apart get the cabin pressure up to maximum that'll tear us apart [Music] why haven't they attacked us i could have sworn they were coming in for the kill [Music] captain you're a fool star wolf no one survives an act of treason activate the defense shield yes sir there's no shield we can't penetrate shielding activated sir can't hold out long we'll lose power captain if we gotta go let's go down fighting let's show them what we're made of i'd rather die of old age cool it i don't need heroes or cynics on this flight rocky i don't get it they still haven't attacked us what are they waiting for get back to your stations yes it's their strategy they're playing with us like a cat full of mobs who asked you [Music] all right elkin let's see if you can penetrate this shield [Music] huh decreased altitude it's too late sir you [Music] crazy [Music] so [Music] so [Music] me [Music] ceasefire [Applause] backers three you haven't seen the last of me [Music] looks like we made it that's for knocking out my officer [Music] look alive you guys there's work to do rocky are you okay say something we did it we got away from them who is this guy all i know is he's ten times as strong as we are and he got us through the wolf raiders [Music] single-handed [Music] [Music] [Music] attention please backus 3 has just arrived at landing station 14. here is the latest report on the attack of the balm the raiders due to heavy damage aerospace port number six has been closed to all traffic until further notice that's off port what do we do i just talked to headquarters they said all streets leading to the base have been destroyed check that out yes sir attention please take charge of the prisoners immediately to space command headquarters for debriefing we repeat senior officers of all incoming flights proceed at once to space command headquarters excuse me how can i contact spaceport six right up there sir thank you [Music] [Music] did he tell you how he got that wound he refused to answer any of our questions he started shouting and acting crazy so i gave him a tranquilizer to quiet him is he likely to get violent he's highly unpredictable please maintain him here under heavy guard thanks for the warning bye come on so [Music] to marianne barbara oh darling darling where's marianne our daughter where is she where is she marianne's resting oh thank goodness i was so worried something had happened during that terrible attack i couldn't find her anywhere and i passed out and woke up here now we're all together again [Music] oh no you dancer you but so ken was safe for the moment but where could he go what could he do an outcast on his own planet a fugitive alien on earth he would have to make a fresh start somewhere but where and how could he get there [Music] a spacecraft i'll have to hijack one [Music] uh [Music] nobody around but how do i get aboard [Music] hello stranger did you just drop by for coffee or were you planning to stay on for the cocktail hour [Music] well friends you're not a very gracious guest doesn't very courteous to point a gun at your host you shouldn't have run away from that nice clean infirmary how about giving me the gun that's enough turn around and face the wall go on don't you think it'd be a good idea to check if it's loaded what the stupidest thing i ever did was to save the life of a bow narrator you people have no respect for life you would even kill your own families if it brought you some advantage the world will never be safe with people like you around look you'd even destroy the universe barbarian the minute i saw you i knew you were one of those savage bound the wolves i should have let you die you know something that was my last flight i wanted to devote the rest of my life to my wife and kid my wife just died in my arms my daughter was already dead honestly where is the pride in killing defenseless women and children you call that heroism when we saved you a little swatch of cloth got torn off your uniform i found one exactly like it next to the body of my little daughter so what have you got to say go on i'm listening i was a vulnerator there's no point trying to hide it i was on a mission but i killed one of my comrades in an accident i ran away now the other wolves are hunting the traitor you're lying through your teeth expect me to buy that it's the truth i swear it now listen to the rest of the story we attacked earth my buddy ordered me to kill a child [Applause] i couldn't and it was then that he turned his rifle on the child then i saw him raise his gun to fire i just wanted to get him to put the rifle down suddenly i looked down and saw that glassy look in his eyes i'd forgotten how strong i was ken you did the right thing the world is mad you know i never keep any bullets in my gun thought of killing anyone is too horrible i didn't feel that way when i was about your age i was like you wild and reckless up till today you killed for kicks you were just like i used to be a thrill killer i wasn't i was a soldier carrying out orders there's no dishonor in that what is dishonor then killing for a corrupt power or betraying your own conscience you betrayed us you traitor cigar i've been thinking things over no point in retiring now with no wife or family to go home to you know i'm going to need some new men in the crew young fellow who's become a fugitive who's being hunted all over the universe could do a lot worse than throwing in his lot with the crew of backus three we might even get to be friends i don't understand what have i done to deserve this we don't deserve half the things we get [Laughter] you're stuck here listen you do exactly what i tell you and you have a good chance of turning into a man not just a wolf raider and don't you ever forget i know exactly who you are and where you came from one false move and i'll set you adrift to fend for yourself captain [Music] whether you like it or not looks like you just signed on joe i kind of think i like it [Music] captain everything's fine while ken was being welcomed aboard bacchus iii and starting his life as an earthling back on val'nestar ken's former home the wolf raiders were returning from their unsuccessful mission to conquer earth their leader the notorious lord halcon was determined to punish ken mercilessly for his supposed betrayal [Music] rita i take it you have already heard that your brother has lost his life yes he was killed by ken ken did it why that can't be true i know it must seem impossible you loved each other and he was your brother's friend i trusted him too how sad it is to put your trust in a traitor and that's not the worst part he killed your brother in an attempt to defend an earthling then he escaped into the unknown in a stolen spaceship he is a coward a traitor he has disgraced us all and has forfeited the right to live must he die yes and you must be his executioner it is an old boundary law that murders must be avenged by the victims next of [Music] kin [Music] remember rita ken must die by your hand you are not to return here without his head without his head without his hand ken [Music] ken you will pay dearly for what you did i know you've heard of the star guerrero it's in the center of the seventh constellations inhabited by a strong and independent nation um we have been allied with guerrero for centuries and now they are threatened their mortal enemies have developed a super weapon super weapon i don't have all the details but we have an intelligence report apparently this weapon can destroy all continent if we do nothing to prevent it then i'm afraid carrero is doomed to extinction and that is the reason that they got in touch with us after giving it careful consideration i've decided that you are the only man capable of doing the job but they've always handled their own defenses this time they've got more than one enemy it looks like the valner raiders are going to attack valnestar is one of the strongest forces of evil in our universe [Music] i understand there's no way that they can handle this alone yes the carrarans are valiant people but they are no match for the valner readers very well accept the mission good excellent i knew you wouldn't disappoint us i always look forward to the crew check especially with such a fine crew as the one on the back is three that's rocky the best space pilot in the business you remember dan my navigator indeed i do oh and this little darling is your morale officer no doubt negative sir lieutenant tommy knows more about computers than the two of us put together you don't say young billy he's going to make a fine officer someday it's a good crew joe not quite finished sir hmm a new face he looks like he could handle himself in a fight always rough and ready all right but that's just what i need on this mission real bruiser after all the val narrators aren't what you'd call sweet and gentle either sir listen joe we're asking you to set out on a dangerous assignment we can't afford any unknown quantities out there do you know anything about this man's background i just want to recruit this guy i wasn't planning to adopt him joe i like you okay if you think he's all right then he's all yours ah uh [Music] [Applause] [Music] try to understand i did what i had to rita [Music] are you on surveillance duty sorry i scared you you looked so angry i was afraid i was going to get strangled who's rita your wife or your girlfriend can't cut your tongue shut up sorry i'm just a little tired you know ken i'm beginning to think you're not an earthling you haven't got the slightest idea how to talk to a girl honestly i just wanted to say hello you didn't have to bite my head off i don't feel like talking and i don't like people meddling in my affairs oh you don't we'll have it your way [Music] this crew had better start learning to get along it's going to be a difficult mission our next mission will take us to vaholy in the thirty second constellation however before reaching our final destination we will call on carrara which has asked the space agency for our assistance as you may have heard correro and vahally are at war and recently the wolf raiders have joined forces with the holy in other words this will be no picnic well what do you say do we accept sir i'd rather go and fight and sit down here bored out of my mind captain i think this is one mission where you're not going to need whiskey for excitement i'll need a stiff belt when i get back though captain we're not gonna take him along cool it danny but captain who is he i've made my decision and take it or leave it captain i'm sorry i'm sure you know what you're doing captain we accept your decision ken welcome aboard are you sure you've got what it takes for the job you bet we have with captain joe in charge no mission is impossible well time will tell i've had a rebuilt from stent to stern to withstand the extreme velocities out there i don't want to have another encounter like i had with the wolf raiders i thought i was going to explode like a balloon i sure hope i never have to go through anything like that again captain what are the specs on this job sir we've added a power unit that can take us up to speeds of uh mach 5 6 and over any more speed would tear us apart you know i'm really looking forward to flying this whole devil who am i joe hi harry are you really going to take on that mission sure thing you leave the milk runs to us well you always were a daredevil by the way is there any truth to that rumor they say rocky wants out of this mission if he feels like a change i could sure use him sounds like someone's over active imagination rocky's accounted for i wouldn't go anywhere without him right on good luck this is a strange development using my superior strength to fight my own people sure i'd love to liberate baldness star from the tyrant elkin but my whole family's up there and rita does she know i killed her brother will i ever be able to explain to her what really happened the commander of flight 429 guy rocky hates me can captain joe control him [Music] getting along [Music] [ -_- ] so rocky well that answers my question i thought you were a wolf raider they planted you on our flight to sabotage our mission but i won't let you what's going on captain captain i know who he is now hey he's a star wolf [Laughter] rocky how often do i have to tell you you should stop reading those science fiction novels but captain i know ken's a lot stronger than we are but there's a reasonable scientific explanation for that you spent a lot of time in another constellation that increases strength don't expect any gratitude for me i won't now you listen to this what i expect from you is total obedience you know you'll only continue to live as long as i shut up [Music] and so our valiant space adventurers prepare to embark on a perilous and exciting mission [Music] meanwhile on valor star other plans are being made remember it is our law you may not return until the traitor has died by your hand [Music] marianne barbara my baby my wife i don't care anymore what happens to me out beyond the stars if i don't survive then we can be together again that much sooner yes i miss you so rest peacefully until then it won't be long now [Music] well that just about says it all as always you'll have to trust me thanks you're a great crew well to the mission cheers cheers rocky aren't you going to drink with us sir i want you to order me to go on this mission i sure will rocky i order you to pilot back as three yes sir i guess you're stuck with me at the controls let's go for it then you all space out this is yours hello yes captain it's for you we're all ready to go right departure 10 9 eight seven six five four three two one zero liftoff [Music] and so the reconditioned backus 3 blasted off for her next encounter with destiny this mission would be the most demanding the ship and her crew had ever been asked to endure hardly were they clear of the earth's atmosphere when captain joe immediately tested the newly installed speed acceleration equipment the ship was going to need all the speed she could get and he had to know early on if the crew could take the [Music] pressure [Music] [Music] foreign so [Music] normal cruising speed roger [Music] ecv course verification completed good change course to 2401 activate course correction jets [Music] neutral drive on engine unit off engine off [Music] [Music] ah ken while you were counting the stars it must have worked out a lot huh what's up to you i noticed the lift off didn't affect you rocky knock it off [Music] and while our intrepid warriors are on their way to save kararu star ken's former sweetheart rita is about to set out on her deadly mission from valner star her assignment to kill ken ken why did you have to kill my brother [Music] ken [Music] rita emotion has no place in this mission yes sir guerraro is around the same size as the earth it has a brownish red color from iron oxides and it's very rich in minerals i've heard some very ugly rumors about the carraran people they don't have much of a reputation for hospitality planets with great wealth look down at the rest of us they don't want to admit they need us it's a good idea to keep on your guard all the time and stay cool in all your dealings with them you hear what i just said ken um registered number one three zero backus three requests clearance for landing [Music] so [Music] retro's ready engine on [Music] so [Music] [Applause] engine off engine doesn't it feel great to be back on the ground again rocky they send someone to meet us ken release the gangway okay oh captain joe he seems to know you captain joe and one officer follow me yes sir the rest wait here till you receive further orders doesn't sound too friendly can it rocky i'm going to establish contact meanwhile you wait here keep it cool we're going to be involved in very delicate negotiations get back i'm taking in the gangway looks like we'll be here for a while has anybody here got a deck of cards they're supposed to be our allies i was never welcomed anywhere like this before [Music] so [Music] what is this strange feeling inside me there's trouble out there somewhere and i want to be part of it yes sir well i think i'll do a little reconnaissance well in order to stay here you can't leave the ship can would you do that hey billy let's join him out there right stop her i'll shoot hey what do you think you're doing we have orders to wait here in the spacecraft and that's exactly what we're going to do we have to stick together [Music] i've felt this excitement before when i was fighting with the wolf raiders [Applause] [Music] bang bang say how much longer now his excellency will be with you shortly i believe you said that two hours ago [Music] [Laughter] so i'm captain joe this is rocky our first officer odenja lord of kararu we asked you to leave your planet and come and help us because of hostilities with the star cesar i don't understand why have they declared war on you they want what we have we have mineral resources cesar is envious of rather than pay for them like everyone else they think they can obtain them by force and violence we used to laugh at cesar unfortunately they've grown stronger dangerously stronger they've acquired a super weapon which could destroy our planet or possibly our whole [Music] constellation [Music] [Music] sorry [Music] oh [Music] all right [Music] yay [Music] hello boy i don't like your face it's ugly get lost i guess you're not from here otherwise you'd know it's good manage to drink with friends here go on i told you to drink i must be careful doesn't he know i can kill him with one blow strangers aren't welcome bye hey where are you going this old teacher here's one more [Music] [Music] ah yes he would just [Music] get him get him stop him [Music] stop it [Music] where is he i saw him going there come [Music] on [Music] just a second i'll be right back [Music] look who's in trouble what did he do [Music] your crew is the limit in the spacecraft during our negotiations that man was arrested in a storehouse for precious stones what was he doing in there her excellency if he left the ship it was in direct violation of my orders you ordered him to steal the stones that young fellow is new to our crew i'm afraid he doesn't take orders seriously i ordered him to stay aboard then you don't mind if i cut off his head not at all suit yourself huh order the execution where were we we uh we're discussing the fee that's right let me give you your down payment one two three go too big three we'll collect the rest on completion [Music] [Laughter] [Music] uh [Music] [Applause] hey come on get down this is no monkey cage [Music] i was just checking out the layout here looks like you forgot the exit if i can't find one i'll make one cut the funny stuff you've just been ordered executed that ought to take the smile off your face by the way don't waste your energy you can't get out of here no earthling can earthly not even a wolf raider could break out of this place is that so we'll see about that [Music] captain anyone can make a mistake just as long as you don't keep on repeating it i think we should get rid of ken i disagree have you already forgotten ken saved our lives i think he deserves another chance don't you agree okay i guess you're right i'll take him back on one condition sir as a cesar officer in that jail hmm and you think ken can help him break out of there let's go to it establish contact with ken's secret radio on the double yes sir [Music] ken can you hear me it's me joe captain how come you never told me about this cute little gadget you don't have to know everything i wanted to make sure you wouldn't double cross us and i guess i've passed her examination haven't i now what do you want me to do listen carefully there's no time to lose ken there's a cesar officer in your jail we need him as camouflage when we move on to cesar they won't suspect anything if we show up with one of their we want you to contact that officer get him and yourself out of prison why don't you just ask the carrara authorities to release us i asked for permission just to talk to him for five minutes and they got suspicious if i say i want to take him to cesar chances are they'll think i've joined forces with their mortal enemies are you sure i can find him and get him out of this prison sure ken i have complete confidence you can bring it off somebody's coming he's gone now listen sir aren't the carrarans likely to suspect you if i break out of here carrarans can suspect anything they want as long as i can get off this planet with the officer i understand only how am i supposed to get out of this prison cell those bars are as strong as tree trunks [Music] [Applause] is star wolf suddenly going soft just give me my orders you'll find you've got some clever little items with you go on okay now i want you to listen carefully i hear you fine uh take a good look at your far right shoulder button we've equipped it with a miniature nuclear device you'll find the ignition on the reverse side works a little like a grenade whatever you want to blow up attach it to it hmm are any more of these buttons grenade check your lapel now you see how much i trust you thanks now then what happens if i don't find this cesar officer you will you will because you have to if you don't bring it off i'm abandoning you here look don't you think this is an awfully tall order [Music] ken i know you can handle it and where do i take him when i get him out of here not back to the spaceship signal us when you're clear over and out star wolf what's that i heard a noise someone's coming the coast is clear [Music] [Music] so [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] oh pleasant dreams hey hey you the cesar officer yes and i gather you're the earthling who was captured earlier today how did you get out of your cell just a little good luck you escaped how listen we've got no time to lose the carrarans must have anesthetized me before they put me in my cell i have no idea where i am in here can you guide me if i get you out yes i've been locked up in this miserable place for the last two months on my way to the courtyard for exercise i've memorized every corridor that's great you're not afraid are you can i trust you you can just get me out of here i will move away [Music] not like that you gotta put it on two bars thanks [Music] uh i've never seen anyone as strong as you are we better hurry come on let's get out of here [Music] where to [Music] there's only one way out listen the door is locked on the outside what's on the other side two karan guards heavily armed okay here's what we do somebody help me what's going on [Music] [Applause] good work let's go [Music] we'll have to fight it out great my favorite sport [Music] come on give me one of those you really pick those two off easily oh i'm not a bad shot watch this oh better get out of here quick [Music] take the one on the right two prisoners escaping i'll climb the wall then pull you up hurry [Music] take a running jump and grab my ankle quickly [Music] hurry after them faster [Music] come back you haven't got a chance the cesar officer is injured we've got them now one of them's hurt move in fast get going after them [Music] ugh [Music] go on without me no way i've got to put that cannon out of commission stay here till i get back go on don't move [Music] try and hold on it won't be long now faster oh i just know they're going to make it is that so they'll be the first ones they say not even wolf raiders can break out of that jail we'll just see about that ken will come through i just know he will well sir how much longer can we sit on the ground without arousing suspicion captain captain that liaison officer's here no [Music] captain joe i have orders from lord of denger you are to fly to the star cesar immediately [Music] i imagine you know that there are no further obstacles to your immediate departure what do you mean by that i'll be glad to tell you the renegade earthling and a cesar officer friend are surrounded on all sides i should imagine by now both of them have been shot which means there's no point in waiting prisoners have nothing at all to do with us he saved us a court-martial with one of them we're ready to go at once that's splendid captain we can't wait any longer prepare for takeoff yes [Music] so [Music] captain joe can you hear me ken where are you i'm not sure but it's a long way from that prison good what about the officer can you track him ken do you read me yes captain the officer is badly wounded he can't hold out much longer what are your instructions ken this is rocky listen proceed to 60 miles west of your present location get your bearings from the sun i'll meet you there in five hours over did you say five hours there's no way we can hold out that long ken it's your only chance understand that location is off the astra navigation lanes it's the only safe spot to meet you okay i'll try it i sure don't feel like dying out here over and out captain okay we're on our way everyone to your stations yes sir control tower control tower this is backers three ready to take off for cesar star [Music]

an earth space command uniform i was forced to wear this uniform they said they'd kill me otherwise a likely story i don't know what's come over you ken you've turned traitor abandoned me and killed
