[dramatic music] [gentle music] [people shouting] Watch the dice! Come on then. - Hey, snake eyes! - Oh, come on! No, no, no! - Come on, let's go! - There you go. - How about you, Smiley? - Oh, come on! [man] Yes, quick get down here! Quick! Come on, quick! Don't forget that two bob you owe me. - What two bob? - The two bob I won. You'll be lucky. - [seagulls cawing] - [chattering] [seagulls cawing] What sort of a free country do you call this? A quiet game of craps and we have to run away like crooks. - As if we were playing for money. - Aye. [men laughing] [ship whistling] Come on out, you Dingle boys. Sergeant Fawcett. That means real trouble. [Fawcett] Come out of there, you Dingle boys. [man] Right Juggler, what's it this time? Come on, spill it. I'll not come in there again and getting my feet wet. [Fawcett] If you don't come out by the time I count to ten, I'll send for the dogs. One, two, three, four, five, six. Ah, Dave Wyman. And Smiler Larkin, and Cream O'Casey. Well, now, if it isn't my old friend Sergeant Fawcett. Shut up there, Cream. And Brad Pearson. And the one we've come to see, Juggler Dodds. What have I done? Search him. What's missing then, Sergeant? [Fawcett] Only a motorbike, and when we find the logbook, we'll find the thief. I ain't got no logbook. [Fawcett] It won't be probation this time, Juggler, you heard what the magistrate said, he'll send you up. - That goes for you too, Wyman. - Nothing on him, Sergeant. Don't relax, Juggler. We'll find it. You Dingle boys are a menace and a nuisance to the district. Why don't you get some honest work? With call up round the corner, no one's interested in us. - Why should we waste our time? - Yes, we scrape a living. Perhaps the Army will do something for you. Same as it did for your father. Yes, what did it do for him? Gave him the Distinguished Conduct Medal. Well, what did it do for me ma and me when he was killed? You can't live on a medal. No, but you can live up to it. When we find that logbook, Juggler, we'll be calling for you. Don't go too far away. [seagulls cawing] Get this, Juggler. It's the last time I'm covering up for you again. Next time, I'll help send you up for a stretch. Okay? Make a fire, and burn it. Split it. Charm. [ship horn blaring] [fire crackling] - [upbeat jazz music] - [crowd cheering] Fine women and song, that's Juggler. Yes, and he can't sing and he don't drink. [men laughing] Come on kid, get with it. Get with what, that? Get lost. - Hi. - Hi. - Come here often? - Shut up, I'm concentrating. Don't wear yourself out. - What do you do? - Anybody. - I mean work. - Work, are you kidding? - What's wrong with work? - Well, it's all right if you like it. - But don't tell me you work. - Why not? With a face like yours, you ought to be in movies. - Shall I tell you something? - Yeah. - You look exactly like Liz Taylor. - Do I? Well, I suppose if... I string along with you, you'll get my name in lights. Drop dead. [audience applauding] What was it, Juggler, get lost or drop dead? We're having kippers for breakfast. - [men laughing] - [dramatic music] [audience applauding] Ladies and gentlemen, now please, don't rush forward, like I told you before, you'll get hurt if you do that. It's come, Dave. Me call up. - When do you go? - Thursday. Thursday? - Ching. - Smashing, we're together. Poor old mum. Leave the kid alone, Joe. You should have been born in a civilised country, Smiler. You get no call up. Well, that's not enough, ladies and gentlemen, for five pounds, we must have more competitors. [man] Before I award the prize, anybody here like to join in? Go on then, Dave, get with it there. Whack, it's dead easy. - Go on, there. - Take it easy. See what these schmoes can do first. [man] Five whole pounds, so it's just pure singing, nothing else. And... Young lady, give her a big hand now. - [audience applauds] - [people whistling] That's enough, that's enough. Tonight it's the singing we applause, and not the figure. - Now tell me, what is your name, my dear? - Dinah Brown. Dinah Brown. That's a very nice name. Tell me, Dinah, where do you come from? Now speak up. They want to hear where you come from. -The Cake Walk. - Now, about that figure. I'd settle for the fiver. What are you going to sing for us tonight? "Isn't This a Lovely Evening?" Well, I suppose it's a lovely evening. [audience laughs] Now, now, now... what key would you like it in, my dear? Oh, any key, I don't mind. Well, Ronnie's got lots of keys, so, Ronnie, "It's a Lovely Evening" in any key.

There you are, table reserved for you. Now while you're here, I want you to remember one thing. We're just one big happy family. Now, if any of you feel homesick, feel that you miss your mothers, remember, you can always come to me. [men laughing] - What are you laughing at Simpson? - I'm homesick, sir. [men laughing] Still the camp comic, eh? Stand up, come here! Now, you listen to me Simpson. One of these days you know what I'm gonna do to you? No, sir. I'm gonna cut off your legs below the knees, sharpen up the shin bones, drive them into the squarest goalposts, and use your head as a football, not half! All right, get your food. [people chattering] [laughs] Camp comic, eh? Scouse. Come on, Dave. [bright flute music] Hey, remember that comic's name. Ah, Simpson. We'll have some fun with him later. [upbeat jazz music] What is it, Badger? Is it a bubble cut or an Italian? Didn't you know? It's a bear skin. Oh, yes, he's doing sentry outside Buckingham Palace. [man] How'd you like your potatoes, mate? Bashed, mashed or boiled? - More. - [man] More? Yes, more. Gravy? Uh... Just a touch of gravy. Why not try some knuckle-duster sauce, Scouse? [Dave sniffing] - [men shouting] - [broken dishes] [people chattering] - Well, Sergeant Major, new batch in? - Yes, sir. What were they like? - Quiet lot, sir, no trouble. - [debris crashing] [men shouting] [debris crashing] [captain] Halt there! Which of you men struck the padre? It's all right, Captain Brewster, it was an accident. I walked right into it. Who the devil started all this? Very well. - Sergeant Major? - Sir. Take the name of every man present, put them on a charge. Get them all into denims, clear up this mess, make a list of all the damage to Army property and report to me. Sir. Alright you heard, fall in outside! Jump to it! [sergeant] Come on, come on, move! - New in today? - Yes, sir. - What's your name? - Wyman, sir. Don't make a habit of this Wyman, get you into trouble. - No, sir, sorry about the... - That's all right. Look if you've got any excess energy, in the gym, that's the place for it. - Yes, sir, and thanks. - That's all right. Go on. [lively music] Oh, darn it, another ladder. Lend me a pair of yours. My sweater, my skirt, earrings, how are you for pants? Oh, I wish I could have been there when Fred Oakley saw my publicity pictures. Your publicity pictures look more like cling then sing. You'll be the lush thrush of the Palle all right if that's what you want. Oh, just another stepping stone. For what? Give me a job and a steady supply of boyfriends, that's me. Me, I'm different. I want to marry a millionaire. Oh, I'll have a mansion, two swimming pools-- One green and one pink? Yeah, and a Cadillac, sort of goldish. And a poodle, of course. And he'll finance a musical show, with me as the star. Spain, Monte Carlo, New York. What, not London? Oh, yes, that as well. I'll play every capital of the world. I can see it all now, my name glittering in lights. That's not the lights you can see, baby, that's your liver. Oh... [pretending to laugh] Very funny. - [knocking on door] - Who's that? It's registered! Postman asked me to give it to you meself. [sighs] - Well, aren't you gonna open it? - No need too. I know what it is. Don't say he sent your photos back? Now you'll have to get a job, and quit dreaming. There's a notice in the window at the Snake Bite, they want a waitress. What, me as a waitress in a coffee shop? What do you take me for? Well, it'll help to pay your rent, wouldn't it? I'm sorry about the rent, miss Jenkins, I'll get a job. But not as a waitress in a coffee shop. Not on your nelly. [upbeat jazz music] How about that gold Cadillac? Didn't you hear? I changed it for a silver Rolls Royce. [Maureen laughs] Well, what's the joke? - Your pal, Dave. - What about him? I sent Dave a publicity picture of Dinah and signed it with love and kisses, and he's poison to her. [both laughing] You slay me, Maureen. [trumpet blaring] [men chattering] - Private Wyman? - Sir. I told you to have your hair cut. Now he tells me. - What did you say? - Nothing, sir. Come down here. Now then, I told you to have your hair cut. - That's right, sir. - Well, why haven't you done it? Well, I fancy it this way, sir. Queens regulations lay it down that you have it cut Army-style. Now, Sergeant Major. Corporal! Take this man to the barbershop and stand by until he gets his hair cut. On the double, quick march. He's still got a chip about the Army, sir, but he's gonna make a good soldier. If and when I want your opinion, Sergeant, I shall ask for it. Yes, sir. Left wheel, hup. [hairdresser] ♪ Da, da, da, da, da, da, da ♪ Next please. - Priority, Captain Brewster's orders. - Oh, yes. After you, Mr. Wyman. Got your lawnmower handy? [Dave laughs] Still the camp comic, eh? Give him a nice bubble cut. [laughs] Would you like a nice bubble cut as your friend suggested? Or can I recommend the latest? The very latest, a Yul Brynner, leaves your head as shiny as a new-laid egg. [laughs] Look here, whack. You do that and I'll cut your throat. I can report you for that. Not with your throat cut. Now you'll get a regulation cut, the same as the others. Very popular with the girls. Hey, Sweeney, when are you gonna get that birds nest cropped? I'm privileged I am. I'm a civilian. - [Dave] Oh, yes, privileged, eh? - No! [Dave] Well, how's you lose your privileges? No, no, no, no! [panting] [hairdresser] No! No! No, no, no! Yes, yes, yes, go on Mr. Anderson. "Not with your throat cut," he says. So I tells him it's only a regulation haircut, very popular with the girls. Semi jocular if you know what I mean, sir? - And then? - Well, sir, that's when he done it. You have anything to say, Wyman? - Yes, sir-- - Stand to attention! Well... I didn't like the way he seemed to enjoy what he thought he was going to do, you see what I mean, sir? There are many things that you won't enjoy in the Army. But while you're in it, you'll obey orders, is that clear? - Yes, sir. Quite clear. - Very well. And get your hair cut. By Mr. Anderson. [sergeant shouting] Right turn, quick march! Thank you, sir. [commander] You think I've been a bit too lenient, eh, Bristow? Thank you, sir. - Cigarette, padre? - Thank you, sir. If I'd given that boy ten days CP, he'd have had a grouse. Not against me, but a grouse against the Army. And he'd take it out with some other offence, get a worse punishment and a bigger grouse. I'm sure you've done the right thing, sir. No, Bristow, you're not sure. You've been in the Army for years, these boys a few days. You're a professional soldier, they're amblers. It's not their career. They're... grocers, butchers, clerks, and they're passing through the dangerous years between leaving school and call up. Yes, sir, but this is a particularly bad batch. Good and bad, Captain Brewster. Sheep and goats. Only bad character is a weak one, he wouldn't have the initiative to shave off the barber's hair. At this rate, Wyman will have a stripe up in no time. Not a bad idea, eh, padre? Very good one, sir. Give a boy like Wyman some responsibility and he'll... use his initiative in a good cause. He's a bright lad. Too bright, it's his way of being insolent. Brewster's face, was it red. Dave knows more about mines than he'll ever know. What? We've had near enough a dozen washed up on the Cassy, dismantled them ourselves, of course, until the police caught us. [laughing] Said it was dangerous. - Smiler. - Eh? How many did you say, a dozen? Yeah, a dozen. How many, Smiler? Well... maybe only ten. He said only ten. How many? - Five. - Why don't you leave him alone? You keep your nose out of it, I'll push it in for you? Any advance on a five, Smiler? [gasping] You're breaking my arm! Come on you dirty little Scouse, tell the truth. [Simpson] And smile, Smiler. [Smiler] Let go, Simpson. Now get up, Simpson, before I kick your teeth in. [bright music] Lance Corporal Wyman! Lance Corporal Wyman! Lance Corporal, me? You'll soon know all about it. The CO wants to see you. And you'll have to forget all about this lot. It's an offence for an NCO to strike a private soldier. That's why I'm so frustrated. Properly dress, get your hat on. Come and get your stripe. [audience cheering] All right, all right. I hope you're all enjoying yourselves. And incidentally, if there's any jokes some of you fellas don't understand, ask the padre. [audience laughing] All right, all right. We're very grateful to the RAF for sending us Eric Jeffries. But now we're gonna have somebody, one of our own boys, and somebody you all know. Sorry, padre, but I don't think you've met him. [man] It's Dave Wyman. [audience laughing and cheering] - [men whistling] - [man] All right, all right! Turn it up. Dave is gonna sing for us a brand new cheery song, and it's called, "I Want a Cold, Cold Shower."

But now we've gotta do some work. - [crowd booing] -All right, I know, I know. Well, I said work. The initiative tests are due to begin at 23:00 hours. Section needed, Sergeant Major. Corporal Rogers, Corporal Fritz, Franz, Corporal Wyman. [Dave] Sir! You section leaders will go to your quarters, where you'll find sealed envelopes on your beds. [commander] You'll open them at 23:00 hours precisely. That is in exactly... four minutes from now. Now you'll carry out those instructions, however difficult or unreasonable they may seem. All right, Sergeant Major. Fall out sections A, B and C. And jump to it! [men chattering] Now you know, they once sent someone to Paris, hitch hiking there and back. Paris! Ooh, la, la, that's for me. - [men laughing] - Oh, no, I just got my leave granted. Cut it out. Let's get this over with first, before we talk about leave. Coming up now. Six, five, four, three, two, one, zero. Come on, Davey lad, don't keep it to yourself. We've got to get the flag out of the minefield. What? They want us bumped off before we get to Cyprus? Look, you heard what the CO said. We're to carry out this instruction, no matter how difficult or unreasonable they may seem. And we're gonna do it, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Right, Smiler. We'll take care of the guards. - A mind detector wants some white tape. - [Smiler] Yeah. Okay, fellas? - Let's get with it. - [Smiler] Right. [Dave] Let's go. Sorry, chum, CO's orders. [Dave] Come on, fellas. Smiler, get the keys and the safety tape, and open the gate. All right, boys, if anyone comes, you know what to do. When we get the flag, we'll whistle. [whistles] Take these lads, and drag them into the hut. Right, Smiler, follow me and plant the tape as we go. [trumpet blaring] [engine rumbling] You goin' to town? [man] Yep. Hop in the back, make it snappy. Right. Thanks, mate! That's a bit of luck. [laughing] What's so funny? You've been killing yourself all evening. Wyman's section's supposed to stop us getting to the city hall. [laughing] By the time he finds it out, we'll be at least ten minutes ahead. They don't get their orders, they'll go to Brewster. They got 'em, I typed 'em. [both laughing] [ominous music] - [machine buzzing] - [music stops] [ominous music] So's how they gonna get past the guards? Where'd they find a mine detector? Don't ask me, I'm not in it. If anything goes wrong, you'll be up for manslaughter. I'm gonna get out of here and find a phone. Here, come back! I'll stop him! Hey, stop will you? We want to get off. Don't be funny, I'm late now. I've gotta check in by 11:30. - We've gotta get back. - That's too bad. I've got a deadline. I said stop. Okay, you win. Put that thing away, it might go off. [brakes squeaking] [ominous music] - [machine whining] - [music stops] [ominous music] [suspenseful music] Guard point Minefield. Guard point Minefield! [man] Report to Garbo. Lance Corporal Wyman and Section overpowered guard, broken into minefield. Repeat, Guard point Minefield, report to Garbo. Lance Corporal-- Hello? Hello? Hello? Turn out the guard. Orderly, pronto! [ominous music] Can't be far now, Smiler. Dave, there it is! Come back! Smiler! Smiler! - I'm the Dingle! - [explosions booming] What did I tell you! How do you know it's a minefield? Could have been anything. Get out of here, keep your mouth shut and you won't get dragged into anything. [sombre music] Smiler. Smiler. [sombre music] What the devil were they were doing out at the minefield? C Section, down at the minefield. Ought to be at the city hall by now. Killed? Who? No, not Wyman. His sort never are. All right, I'll be over right away. Get the men in. Minefield. Your sparring partner's been a bit too clever this time. Wyman! [dramatic music] [sombre music] [music fades] Well, now, Wyman. That's one of your jokes have misfired. - Joke? - What made you do it? - They were my orders, sir. - Orders? Well, let me see them. I destroyed them, sir. Who told you to destroy them? It was in the orders. Well, you never gave that order, did you? Certainly not, sir. You'd better get back and prepare a report. - I've got some more inquiries to make. - Very good, sir. Sergeant Major, march him back to camp. Get the MO to look after Wyman, and confine the rest of the squad to their quarters. Sir! Fall in, Wyman. March! [sergeant major] Right, turn! Right, turn! Right men, step it along, quick, march! Smart, halt! When you get the fallout, you're going to the canteen, and you'll stay there til you're dismissed. [sergeant major] Right, march! [sombre music] [footsteps tapping] [suspenseful music] [slide bolt thudding] [gasping] I found this. [glass smashing] [glass smashing] [men groaning] Come on. [groaning] I'll use it, Wyman. [gun firing] - [gun firing] - [men groaning] [gun firing] [banging on door] - Get away, there. - Stand back! Open up now! Lance Corporal Wyman, this is Captain Brewster. [Brewster] Lance Corporal Wyman, open this door. [knocking on door] Can I try? You can try. Wyman, would you open the door, please? This is the padre. [knocking on door] This is the padre. Would you open the door, please? [knocking on door] [slide bolt clicking] Don't touch him, wait until the doc comes. Sergeant Major, fetch the MO. - [sergeant major] You get the MO. - [man] Sir. What happened, Wyman? He... He had... He had the gun... - You got it. - And-- And you shot him. No, he... Simpson. First Larkin, now this. Damage to Army property. [gasping] Wyman... I thought you said you destroyed your orders? [sighs] Yes, I did. These are the ones I signed, here on your bed. No, sir. - Simpson... - Where did you get that gun? He... [gasping] All right. He had the gun-- Well, you've had enough rope and you've finally hanged yourself. Don't think the Army's interested in your type Wyman, it isn't. You're a trouble maker. You make trouble for yourself and everybody else. [Brewster] In your backstreet gang of Dingle boys you probably looked big, but in the Army we'll soon cut you down to size. Sergeant Major? Put this man under close arrest. Take him to the guard room, at the double. Fall in, two men. Wyman! Wyman, come back! All right, Sergeant Major. Call out the guard. I'll raise the alarm, get out the Land Rovers to patrol all roads. Sir! [trumpet blaring] All right you lot, report to the guard house and stay there. - [man 1] What's all this? - Gunshot wound, I'd say he had it. - Get some adrenaline, at the double. - [man 2] Sir. [engine rumbling] [man] Halt! Corporal, surround the camp as close as you can, we'll cover the road. Sir! Squad right turn, by the left double march! [trumpet blaring] Wyman's on the run. I hope that satisfies you. Don't worry, we'll get him. How is he, doc? Pretty bad. Very near the heart. How the devil did he get hold of this? When he got the mine detector and the tape, stole them. All right, doc, I'm going to notify the police. - Get an ambulance too, quick. - All right. [sighs] A mess, padre. Questions in the house no doubt. I hope we have the right answers. - [ship horn blaring] - [seagulls cawing] [chattering] [upbeat music] Cup'o special. You know it costs nine pence. What have you been doing, robbing a bank? Or your blind grandmother? How did you guess? Hey? Dinah, here. I've got a present for you. It's just a little something I picked up. Was it too hot to hold? What a Judy! [car horns honking] Come on, ladies and gentlemen, move in a little closer and don't tempt me strainin' me voice. I don't ask you seven shillings and six pence, I don't ask you five bob, I don't ask you anything. [peddler] Step in now, nice and close, and make me an offer. What am I bid for this lovely coat? Do I hear five shillings? Do I hear five and six? Oh. Your suit is ready, sir. Step right into the back and try it on. If it doesn't fit, you don't pay a penny. A regular customer, ladies and gentlemen, who needs my personal attention, and as always Danny gives it. Don't go away, I'll be back in a minute. Look at anything you like. [chattering] What the devil have you been up to, the place is swarming with police? I'm in dead trouble, Danny, I'm on the run and I need some gear. You'd better make for the Cassy. I will tonight, but they're sure to be covering the place. Here, try them trousers. There's a belt. What will you do when you get to the Cassy? [Dave] I'll think about that when I get there. I'll see ya right, Danny. When I get sorted out. Have you got any money for food? No, not gonna lie, I'm skint. There you are, but I'm putting this on the bill, mind you. Get into that. Thank you very much, sir. I knew you'd be delighted with that suit, that's about the best suit I ever made in me life. Unfortunately, I won't make a shilling on it. Out the back. Oh no, sir, you're very welcome. Thank you very much. I didn't come here to make money, I came here to lose money. [people laughing] Ah, the gentlemen over there. Now, sir, come along, half price to the police whether they're in uniform or not. Where's Dave Wyman? Dave Wyman? I thought he was in the Army? - You did, did you? - Uh-huh. Well, he was, he's on the run now, we want him. - You want him? - We do, and we'll get him. Well, if you come across him, give him my kindest regards. Pardon, I'll be back. - He'll be back, did you hear that? - [laughing] Another satisfied customer, ladies and gentlemen, they all come back. [upbeat music] [music stops] Dave's on the run. Take a deco at that, Cream. Look we're famous! "The Dingle boys." Poor old Smiler, he's dead. Smiler's dead. Smiler. You can be certain Dave had nothing to do with this. He'd give his right arm for Smiler. Sure got himself in a load of trouble. Well, we've just got to help him, and the Cassy is his best bet. Why you could hide an army on that water front if you know the right places. Dinah, do you think that you could fix up-- Listen to me, you're not getting this char mixed up in that. And you'd better keep your nose clean. Whoever helps him is sticking his neck out. Count me out. She's right, Cream. I'm not sticking my neck out. Somehows I didn't think you would, Juggler. It would just suit your book to have Dave out of the way. Meaning what? Keep your thieving hands off other people's property. She's not for you. And who's property am I supposed to be? Well, if you don't know, I'm certainly not gonna tell you. - Well, of all the nerve! - Come on. [upbeat music] Take no notice of him, Dave's got a steady date. Who cares? Me. [children laughing] [car horn honking] [knocking on door] - Mrs. Larkin? - No, Mrs. Larkin is ill. I must see her. I'll take you up. - Is it about Smiler? - Yes. Nothing happened to him? - Are you a friend of Mrs. Larkin's? - Yes. I'm afraid I have some bad news. Could we sit down? There's been an accident in the mine field. And my Dave? Dave Wyman. - You're Mrs. Wyman? - Yes, yes, what happened? Your son was not hurt, Mrs. Wyman. But I'm sorry to have to tell you that Smiler Larkin was killed. Killed? How could it happen? My Dave always looked out for Smiler. How could he get killed with my Dave there? Don't blame Dave, Mrs. Wyman, that's what everybody's doing. What do you mean? There was a fight. A man was shot. Mrs. Wyman, your boy is on the run. But Dave couldn't shoot anybody. He fights too much, yes. He looks for fights before they start sometimes, but shoot somebody, no. - [padre] In the Army-- - Oh the Army, yeah. I thought it would be good for him. Now you tell me Smiler is killed and my boy... Mrs. Wyman, I'm sure that we can sort this out, if only we can find Dave. Will you help me? And suppose they still don't believe him? Suppose this boy dies, am I to help put my boy in a murder court? Yes, if you're as sure of his innocence as I am. He's not sure of himself, padre. He never run away before in his whole life. You ask for the police to help you, not me. Every yard he runs, he gets more into trouble. Anyone that helps him will be in trouble, his girlfriend for instance. Dave got no steady girl, he always has something else to do. You don't know this girl then? [Mrs. Wyman] Does Dave? Apparently, she knows him. She looks like a girl who will know a lot of fellows, huh? [Mrs. Larkin] Ruth! Ruth, you didn't get to the best part. He's on his way home, Smiler's coming home. [Mrs. Wyman] Yes, I'm coming. [soft music] I must go to her. Would you like me to tell her? No, I will. Mrs. Wyman, I can't tell you how sorry I am. I know, padre, I know. [gentle music] [sniffling] Look, Ruth, look for yourself. Smiler's on his way home. Ada, Smiler won't be coming home. How do you mean? He's all right? He's all right, isn't he? An accident. Well, what happened? Ruth, tell me what's happened. He's dead. [dramatic music] Smiler? [music fades] [sobbing] My Smiler, dead? [Danny] Four and a half quid to you, lady. You couldn't get better value the world over, feel the throw. - Four pound ten. - Hey, Danny. - What do you want? - Dave's on the-- [clearing throat] Listen here, Dingle boy, we don't want your type around here, the Cassy's the place for you. Now get out of here and stay out! The Cassy. Four pound ten, lady. Feel the quality of that stuff. Magnificent throw. [suspenseful music] [dramatic music] [sombre music] So long as he has food, he can hang out there for weeks. He knows every inch of this coast, particularly between Otters Pool and Dingle Point. [man] Sergeant, he's been seen entering the caves at Dingle Point. Right, we'll soon smoke him out of that. George, ask the Inspector to send me six dogs and handlers, and meet me at Dingle Point, right. - Cheerio, Sam. - Cheerio. [dramatic music] [suspenseful music] [dogs barking] [dramatic music] [music stops] [waves tumbling] [dogs barking] Wyman! Wyman it's no good, you're trapped. We've got you, so give yourself up. If you've got a gun, throw it out before you come out. Wyman, I'm sending in the dogs after you. [sergeant] If you shoot at them, we'll shoot back. - Send them. - [dogs barking] Well, he's not in here. We'd better call them off. - [man 1] Come on, Lynx. - [man 2] Come on, Tosca. - [man 1] Come on. - [man 3] Lie down. [man 2] Come on, Jasper, come on. Tosca, heel. Jasper, Jasper. Oh, Dinah, I'm just off to the pictures. If the man from the Pru calls, tell him I'll pay him the two weeks next Monday. - All right, Mrs. Jenkins. - Thank you, dear. Goodbye. [Dinah] Bye bye. [upbeat jazz music] Get out. Get out of here, or I'll call the police. You're not dragging me into this. Look, I'm not trying to drag you into anything. I'm trying to hide out until tonight, until I can see the boys. - Your friends are over at the Snake Bite. - You saw them? - Yes. - What'd they say? I don't know, and I don't want to know. You're not getting me mixed up in this. Look, I'm in dead trouble. Will you tell the boys I'm here, will you? What do you take me for? Have you seen the papers? - Police and military everywhere. - Did they follow you? Why should they? - I'm-- - [footsteps tapping] [knocking on door] What do you want? It's Dave Wyman, he wants to see you. - Wants to see me? - Yeah. Where is he? Over at my place, I'll take you along. Oh, you will, will you? Get out, Juggler. If you know what's good for you, get out quick! Go away, get off me! [Dinah screaming] Go away! Get off me! [upbeat music] [men groaning] [Dinah] No! Come sit down. [both gasping] Dave... Dave. Thank you. No. I'm glad I was around. The rat! You must be hungry, I'll get you some... Dave, what if he squeals to the cops? No, no Dingle boy ever squeals to the coppers. I don't know, I don't trust him. Look, Dinah. I don't want to get you into this mess, I'll get out, I'll get a hiding place. Not till you've had something to eat, sit down. - Look at your face. - It's all right. It's all bruised. I'll wash it for you. You'd better sleep here tonight. [gentle music] Don't worry. My friend Maureen will be here to keep us company. Good evening, Sergeant. I wonder if you could help me? Do you... happen to know this girl? Oh, dozens like her in Liverpool. What's the trouble? There's no trouble, I'm just trying to locate her. Her parents are a little worried. What's her name? Dinah Brown. The only Dinah Brown I know comes from Jamaica. Know her, George? No. - [George] I'm picking up Juggler Dodds. - Know that face? I've seen her somewhere. I know. She works at the coffee bar near where I live, The Snake Bite. The Snake Bite, huh? [padre] How'd you get there? - Well, you know Lime Street Station? - [padre] Yeah. [announcer] ...and that is the end of the news. Stop worrying. They'll never think of looking here. Come on, you'd better get some sleep. Sleep, where for instance? Here. - Well, I've got a better idea. - Well, sleep on it. Dinah, I'd better take a look outside in case I gotta make a quick getaway. There's a yard at the back, with an alley that leads to the street. ♪ They don't know what it means to rock ♪ ♪ They go to bed at ten o'clock ♪ ♪ It figures that they-- ♪ Maureen will you pipe down? Do you want the cops here? Get to bed. [sighs] [gentle music] Dinah... I've thought a lot about you. Till the bruise came out, huh? What shall I tell Cream? Tell him to fix me a passage to Ireland. Unofficial steerage. I'll wait at the Cassy. Is it safe to go back to the Cassy? Sure. They won't look there again for me. Would you like me to take a walk? No, I think I'd better. [gentle music] Don't let me sleep too long. [upbeat jazz music] Get us a coffee will you, Dinah? You look as though you need it. I do, I've had a terrible night. You know, they've probably caught Dave by now. They haven't. He's with me. What? He wants you to get him a passage to Ireland. Unofficial steerage. I thought you didn't want to get mixed up in any of this? A girl can change her mind, can't she? Oh, sure, it wouldn't be the first time. Look, it takes money to get to Ireland. Have you got any money, Dinah? Money, would I be here? Pop some milk in this, will you? I've gotta be off. Now listen. Keep Dave where he is until I can fix up something, right? Just have to raise the win from somewhere. Thanks, Dinah. Bye now. [padre] Could I have a cup of black coffee? [upbeat jazz music] [music stops] What's the idea? I prefer to talk to you without music, Dinah. - Who told you my name? - You look like Dinah. Oh, a wise guy, huh? If I was a wise guy, I'd know where to find Dave Wyman. What are you, a missionary or something? We eat missionaries around these parts. I'm a padre, we don't taste so good. Very funny. What do you want to talk to me about? Look, I'm like you, I'm a friend of Dave's. - Who's Dave? - Dinah. I've been helping people like Dave for a good number of years now. And I'd like to help you too, if you'd let me try. - I don't need any help. - Don't you? You're fond of Dave. You don't want to see him get into trouble. That's exactly what he's doing running away. He's the only one that knows the truth. They don't want the truth. - They just want Dave. - Who's Dave? What are you trying to do, trap me? I only want to talk to him. Will you take me to him? You won't believe him. - Nobody believes him. - I do believe him. I think I can make the Army believe him. Let me try. Look, this will be between you, and me, and Dave. Nobody else will know, promise. Coffee's getting cold. - Do you mind? - [upbeat music] It helps me think. Go ahead, it stops me. [silence] [car horn honking] I'm shut. You've got nothing I want to buy. I want ten quid, for Dave. There's a boat leaving tomorrow. From me, ten quid? Are you mad? What do you think I am, a millionaire? Come on, Danny, he's an old Dingle boy, I'll pay you back. - You'll pay it back? - Well, I'll work for it. You couldn't work in a pit. Don't make promises you can't keep. Come on, he's got to have it, everything's arranged, Danny. You know they picked up the Juggler? - What? - Oh, you didn't know. You've everything arranged, but you didn't know. You'll have me in jail next. Hold that. - [car horn honking] - [woman laughing] - There's your tenner. - Oh, thanks Danny. Get out. I didn't even see you. [children chattering] [knocking on door] [Dinah] It's all right, it's me. - What's happened? - It's all right. I've seen Cream, and everything's arranged for tomorrow. There's no ship before that. I'd better get to the Cassy. When's it going? No, don't go yet. Why not? Why, they may be watching the Cassy. Look, don't worry Dinah, they won't get me. The blinds. Dave, why don't you go back to camp? What, do you think I'm mad? There must be somebody there who'll believe you. For instance? Padre. Padre? [chuckles] He's just another Bible thumper. We've only had two fights. What? I thought he was a friend of yours. What's the matter, Dinah? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared for you. Don't be silly. You know I'm mad about you, don't you? [knocking on door] It's all right, I know who it is. Come in. So you sold me out, eh? No, I haven't, Dave. - He just wants to talk to you. - Mm-hmm? Well, I don't want to talk to him. You can go, padre, I've got nothing to say. Oh, I have. You've been to see mum? Yep. How is she? How did you expect her to be? Does she know I'm here? No. Look, Dave. - I want you to come back to camp with me. - Not on your nellie. By not coming back, you're playing right into Brewster's hands. Hm, I'm not coming back, I'm taking no chances. You've got to make them believe you. Running away isn't the way to do it. - Simpson died. - Simpson! What about Smiler? [Dave] Nobody cared about him. And don't forget, padre. I didn't start this, remember. We have to finish a lot of things we don't start ourselves. - Life, for instance. - Uh-huh. Well, I'm finishing this my way. I'm getting out. They can come and get me if they can. Look, I know how you feel. When I was a kid in Toronto, I... stole a car and injured somebody, - I wound up in the reformatory. - Oh. Why it's tougher than the Army, Dave. But it taught me a lesson. Good, that's one of us straightened out. Skip it, padre. You're wasting good material. I was trying to save it, but I guess you're right. I'll spare my breath. Don't forget I'll be well away before you can tell the coppers. You have no need to fear that. I won't put you away. You've already done that yourself. [sombre music] Dave, are you sure you're doing the right thing? It's the only thing now. Dave, the padre's your friend. He believes in you. Mm-hmm, and I believe in myself. They've all been against me, ever since I've been there. Brewster, the Sergeant Major, the lot. I haven't got a friend. They blame me for Smiler's death. And if Simpson dies, it'll be a cert to blame me for that, as well. Nobody believes a Dingle boy. They rake up everything we've ever done. Pity we didn't stay Dingle boys. Old Smiler would have been alive now. He'd make ten of them. "I'm a Dingle!" he said, and that bloody mine went off. Dave... You must forget, darling. [gentle music] You're a pal. You're a real friend, Dinah. I thought you said you didn't have any friends. [romantic music] Echo, what events in Liverpool, Echo. Echo, what events in Liverpool. [Dinah] Just my luck. I spend my life looking for a millionaire, to fall for you. What did you say? It's just my luck. No, that bit about the millionaire. Spend my life looking for a millionaire. You're gonna fall for me. - That's what you said, didn't you? - A lot of good it's done me. [engine revving] [brakes squealing] Now then, Juggler. Which house is it? Second house from the end, upstairs scuffer. It had better be, Juggler. [dramatic music] Dave, the cops! [Dinah] They're all over the street. - This is it. - The back window, quick. What's the matter, someone been murdered? - Where is he? - Where's who? Dave Wyman. Dave Wyman? Why should I know him? [dramatic music] [engines revving] [music fades] [boat horn blaring] [Cream] Give us a light, Brad. I've got everything set, see? I'll be down at the wharf about nine, and I'll be driving the car meself. [Brad] What do I do, Cream? [Cream] Wait for Dave down at the Cassy, in the old cave and pick up some gear from Danny's. - But keep your eyes skimmed. - [Brad] Okay. [Brad whistling] Have a go at this, Dave. Seen any scuffers? No, I think I lost them on the way. - This is from Danny. - Good old Danny. Cream's waiting for you at the Old Wharf, he'll be driving the export car. [Brad] He'll give you all the dough when you get there. His friends in Dublin will help you. You will need it. [slow music] Mum! [Dave] Oh, it's so good to see you. - How'd you know where to come? - [chuckles] You think I wouldn't know where to find you after all these years, eh? Come. And I could show you hiding places you'd made and forgotten, better than this. Go and keep watch for scuffers. Oh, Dave. I just saw your girl. What do you think, mum? Lovely. She believes in your innocence, and she thinks you should give yourself up. Mum, you know I'm not guilty. Everything you're doing makes you look it. What else can I do? It belonged to your father. When you don't know what to do, it may give you an answer. [whistling] Brad, who is it? [dramatic music] Okay, it's Juggler. Juggler, what do you want? Just came to see if everything was all right. Well everything is all right, and I don't need your help. [dramatic music] Scuffers! - Dirty rat. - [Mrs. Wyman] Enough! Come on Dave. Up you go, and quick. Now, Juggler, the only one who could tell the police about that way out is you, and all you ever did was to get Dave into trouble. [Mrs. Wyman] Now squeal. Now Mrs. Wyman, where is he? The place is surrounded, so we don't want any lies. Ask him. Where is he, Juggler? [sombre music] I was wrong. He's not here, Sarge. Is that so? Well you are, come on. I've had enough of you. [boat horn blaring] [Dave] Okay. [Cream] Couldn't quite make it. Here are the papers, Dave. Now, look, drive the car onto the boat, see. They'll not ask any questions, and when you get to Dublin, Pat Murphy will be waiting for you. - Pat Murphy. - And I'll be saying me prayers for you. - Ta-ra, Cream. - Ta-ra, lad. [engine revving] [car horn honking] [shouting] [men chanting] [shouting] [man] March 'em to the right! Halt! Stop! Well well, Lance Corporal Wyman. - Sergeant Major Lockwood, I presume. - Stand to attention! Corporal Jones, fall in two men. - Where the devil have you been? - Places. Place this man under close arrest. Prisoner escort, by the front, quick march. It's all right, it's not a gun. Take it out. Give it to the padre. [gentle music] I gave him his father's medal, hoping he would go back. Now I'm not sure I did right. Of course you did, I know it. Now take these, and stop blaming yourself. No, no, a cigarette. There. Funny thing. First Dave is not sure, and now I'm not sure. You know what? I figure there is time for being hero, and a time for running away. Dave's innocent. And if he hadn't gone back, how could he prove it? He's dead, Simpson's died. It's all there. [sombre music] Dave on a murder charge. [Diana sobbing] Dave... I'll see that you're properly represented, Wyman. You know I've told you the truth, don't you, padre? I believe you have. Things have gone against you. Some blackout book. We can only put our trust in God. And my running away didn't help. It's too late to worry about that now. What will they do? Well, if it's murder, you know what they'll do. Unless we can get a reprieve. Try and get the charge reduced to manslaughter. [door rattling] - Lance Corporal Wyman. - Sir. [sombre music] - What do you want? - It's about Wyman, sir. Wyman? What about him? What will they do to him? Hang him, for certain. Hang him? - They can't do that! - Why not? Well, he didn't... What do you know, Badger? I don't know nothing, sir. Badger, did you ever see a man hang? Me, sir? No, sir. I did. It's not a nice sight. They blindfold him in the condemned cell, then he has a short walk, the trapdoor is drawn, and he's dead. It's not a man hanging, what I can't get out of my mind is... the doubt of his guilt. You know what I mean, Badger? Yes, sir. Wyman didn't do it. He couldn't have, it was Simpson's gun. Suppose you tell me what you came in here for? It was Simpson's fault, I told him he was crazy. Simpson, I mean. Tell me what you know, Badger. Been keeping quiet long enough. Private Badger, you swear on oath that this is Simpson's gun? Yes, sir. Well, how do you know it is? He stuck it into the back of the lorry driver when he refused to pull up, sir. That tallies with the statement from the lorry driver, sir. How long has Simpson had the gun? Quite some time, sir. I was with him when he won it from the armoury. Won it? Oh, yes, yes. He thought it would come in handy for civvy street, Sir. We work the race tracks and the dogs. - Do you know the number? - Hasn't got any number, sir. Simpson filed it off. Inspector. Thank you. Simpson had this gun when you returned to barracks? Yes, sir. - Absolutely sure? - Yes, sir. I'd better notify the Chief Constable about this new evidence. In the meantime, I'd like to hang on to this, and I'd like to have this man for further questioning. All right, private Badger, you go along with the Inspector. I think I'll have a whiskey and soda. I think I'll join you. [man] On the left, quick march! Right, left, right, left, right, left. [man shouting in the distance] [knocking on door] [sergeant major] Quick march! Right wheel! Halt, left turn! Lance Corporal Wyman, sir. Now congratulations, Wyman. You've been cleared of the charge. The police are satisfied with your statement, and you're a free man. Thank you, sir. I'm afraid I misjudged you, Wyman. I'm sorry. Is that in the book? Yes, it's all right. I looked it up. You got off on the wrong foot when you cut the barber's hair. Yes, sir. Afraid so, sir. You've got the makings of a first-class soldier, Wyman. Who me, sir? [commander] Getting the flag from the minefield was done in a soldierly manner. You didn't consider the consequences, you thought they were my instructions and you carried them out. Yes, sir. Now don't let the death of Larkin weigh too heavily on you. [commander] You mustn't hold yourself responsible. Smiler was my pal, sir. I know, I know, but... it was an accident. Yes, sir. Wyman, have you ever considered the Army as a career? Well, it's just a suggestion. Uh... Do you think, sir, that Wyman could have a few days compassionate leave? I can see that might be arranged, anything special? Yes, sir. He wants to get married. Don't you? Oh, yes, sir! Yes, sir! In that case we'd better make it a week. Eh, Bristow? Very definitely, sir. Thank you, sir. - Thank you, sir. - All right, Wyman. And the best of luck to you. Gave me a bit of a shock, Wyman. Thinking we've got you for another seven years. - I can think of worse. - Can you? Well, I can't. That's the narrowest escape the British Army's ever had since the retreat from Dunkirk. Wyman! What are you doing? Proposing, sir! [gentle music] Carry on.
