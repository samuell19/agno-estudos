"Just arrived at my dad's. Shall I come round for you first?" "1 message from: Malia." "Too late. Leaving at 4 tomorrow. Hugs" You got a problem? Yeah, it's me. Already? I thought you were leaving Monday. We don't have time for this! Don't threaten me! I'll call you back. Now you're giving me orders? Make up your mind! - Now sign it! - I'm a scientist. - It's all true. - Shut up! Admit it's bullshit. You hear? Bullshit! You're crazy! The facts are clear. Your threats can't change that. - I'm losing patience. - I won't do it! Untie me! Do you think I'm stupid? Right... it's decision time. Do you want me to get nasty? Let him go! - No! Seb! - Let him go! Little shit! - Stop! - Run, Seb! Quick! Run! Get the kid! Get him! He got away! This is Patrol 2. I have the description: 4 feet, 4 inches tall, grey hooded top, grey shorts. And he might still be armed. Roger that, Patrol 2. He's just a kid, he can't have got far. Malia, where are you? Is your bag in the car? Malia! - Malia... - Don't hurt me. Hide me. They're after me. It was an accident, right? You didn't mean it. - Why did you kill him? - Who? I said it was an accident. You couldn't have killed your dad. He's dead? - It wasn't me. - The police are after you. Do you believe me? I swear it wasn't me. How could I do that? - Malia? - Quick! Hide! Are you ready? We've been looking everywhere for you. - Have you seen him? - Who? You know who. A murderer on the run is capable of anything. He didn't kill him! We need to get away. Let's go. Excuse me, officer! - He was at our house. - Did you see him? - No, he must've run off. - OK. - Where is it? - Second on the left. "Thanks. I'm innocent." What are you looking at there? - Give me that phone, please. - Malia, do it. Give it here. What's the code? - Give it to me. - 2706. - 2706. - What do you want? - I'm doing my job. - Do it later. Turn around and go home. Now. - 2706? - Yes. ...suspect hasn't been found, despite a major police search. It is very likely he is still in the vicinity... - Could he be dangerous? - We don't know for sure. But we can't rule it out... At his age, he can't have got far. Don't move! How is it in there? Does it smell good? Can I get out? Man, you stink! My name's Kevin! How did you do it? I always say I'll kill him, but I never do. - Who? - My dad. And with a shotgun! Too cool! "Where R U?" - Hey! - The cops have her phone! If you call her, they'll track you down. Come on! - If I help you, you help me. - How? - With my dad. - I didn't kill my dad. OK, save all that for the cops. Imagine if you'd kept it. That was faster than in the movies. Relax, I'll hide you. - Search every floor. - They're coming! Police. Open the door. Have you seen anyone, madam? He's here! It wasn't me! He's here! - Shut up! - He's here! Shut up, or you're dead! Izmir! - Izmir! - Hold it there, kids! Let me deal with this. She went without saying goodbye. Woman are cruel. - What are you doing here? - I live here. - And you? - He invited me over, to play computer games. - You got a phone? - Why? - Give it to me. - Why me? Give me your phone. If you see that little murderer, call me on this number. Berrigo. OK? Let's go. Let's get back to work. - Why aren't you away on holiday? - My mum has fallen in love. We had train tickets and everything, but then she met some guy online. - He's a sex maniac. - How do you know? I read their webchats. She only comes back here every few days. She asks if I'm OK, cooks me food, then goes back for another jump. That's your mother, you know! I'm not leaving you. Follow me. Where is he? Where did he go? Hey, killer, where are you? Wait here. - Hey! - There are cops everywhere. Come on. You'll be safe here. Don't answer the door. - I can't just wait here. - Why not? You need to lie low. I need to help my mum. Don't worry, we'll be back. You're coming with me. Are you leaving me alone? I don't know him yet, I can't trust him. - Mum, you know Thomas. - Do I? Sure you do, he's a mate of mine. You're not in trouble? No, with all my work, I don't have time. - I'll make some food. - No, I'll do it. - Hello, ma'am. Kevin... - Coming through! - Thank you. - Don't you move. Call if you need me! Nobody can believe this tragic event. Renowned biologist, Alain Vermillard, murdered by his 13 year-old son. It wasn't me. The boy's prints on the weapon suggest this was the case. Witnesses say he was in a rage. He was kicking everything in his path. He kicked this right at me. I don't know what was wrong, but he was acting strange. He was holding a gun, by the time I realised what it was, he'd gone. It's a well-known phenomenon. In a virtual world of computer games, Sebastien, like many children, lost touch with reality. He was angry, he performs this act and then, faced with a real corpse, reality hits home again, and he runs. - There were two guys there. - No one will believe you. - I'm calling my mum. - Her phone will be tapped. - Hello? - Mum? Pass me the phone, ma'am. Sebastien... Listen to me. You have to... - Why did she do that? - She's no choice. Now do you believe me? They will have traced this number. Hurry up. Come on. - Can you get in everywhere? - I water the plants in summer. Come on. It's OK. - We screwed them over! - I have to go. Wait! I'll go with you. Don't worry. - We're gonna leave him all night? - What else can we do? Mum? She's not here. She hasn't called either. Is this your mum? - Yeah, don't touch. - She's not bad. Look at all these! How many are there? These are old ones I'm fixing. - I sell them sometimes. - You do that? We could go into business. - Who are these guys? - Old people I photograph in public. Sometimes I pretend to be old and I pull old women on the web. - And does it work? - Yeah, they always want a photo. You send one they like, they start talking dirty. Damn! You are a dark horse. - Come on, we're leaving. - To go where? I don't trust Thomas, so I'll take you somewhere else, then we'll see if he has told the police you're here. Don't complain, this is an upgrade. Look at this. You can hide in here. Nobody will see the light on. And look at that big bed. You could have an orgy in there. Right, I have to get home. The picture of the killer is becoming clearer. Inside this seemingly polite teenage boy lay an aggressive criminal. He pointed a gun at his father last year. That was right outside my house. It's not true! I was there. It was a game. - Pointing a gun isn't a game. - They were laughing. It's not a good example. And yesterday, he wasn't angry. Malia, we can't always tell. He might have been pretending. - Where are you going? - For a walk. Or is that forbidden too? Let her go. It's hard on her. - Can I use a computer? - Yes, take the second one. "Sebastien is innocent. We must defend him. "We should let the police know." Hello, sir. Still nothing? Move along. No, nothing. I'm working here. - You think he's still here? - We're waiting for search warrants. Are you going to bust people's doors down? OK, you can work, but move along now. You'll call me if you see anything. It's better if I find him first. Kevin, what's up? - Have you seen Seb? - Not yet. But you didn't snitch. - Why do you say that? - Come on. Is there something wrong? - Sit down. - It's OK. - I brought you some food. - He should have helped himself. Some bread. And an apple. A yoghurt for later. Here, I checked your wall. Your friend Pablo was online, he sent a message from Malia. Who's Malia? Your girlfriend? None of your business. - I have to call her. - Her phone will be tapped for sure. The cops have her phone. Oh, yeah. Give me her number. Her number was in my phone, and you threw that away. I have her number. Pablo gave it to me. You take a bus to the terminus. Then use a phone box to call Malia's mobile. - Me? - Pretend you're Sebastien. You say you've left the estate. Do you want them to keep looking here? - What if I get caught? - Then you're stupid. - My mum is coming back later. - So hurry up. Sir, I don't think he's here anymore. - You stay out of our way. - I have to work here too. Don't make me arrest you. - Get out of here. - You're not nice. Aren't they helping? They don't care. But I need to water the plants. I'm a journalist. Jean Ligier. You know this place well. In my job, I need guys like you. I know, a fixer. Do you know the boy? I think he's innocent. Imagine the scoop if I can prove it. Can you help me? If I knew anything, I'd have called the hotline. They pay for information. I can pay too. And more than them. This is my number. Think about it. If the kid is in the building, we'll soon flush him out. - Give me the key. - Let me... Wait here. - Talk loud if the police come. - You sure I can't come? You wait here. - Your friend has gone. - No. I'll find him for you. Seb? You must have scared him off. Hurry up! Get in your cars. God damn it! Wait, I can explain. They've gone. We tricked them. Seb? - Kevin! - What are you doing? See? It worked. Kevin? They've all gone. There isn't one cop left. Even at the house. No, wait... there's just one woman. No, I have to go home first. Yes, I have to. Hi, Mum. I've been waiting for you for an hour. I was with some mates. You see? Not everyone has gone away. I hope you're being good. Because I could stay home tonight. It's OK, Mum. I'll be fine. - Hello. Is Thomas in? - Hello. Are you coming? I'm Kevin, there's a film on at the youth club. An old, black and white silent movie. - We don't want to be late. - Youth club? That's good. You're older than him. I can trust you, can't I? OK. After the argument, Sebastien took a shotgun from the garage and, full of rage, according to witnesses, shot his father twice in the back, apparently killing him instantly... That's a lie. He was tied up. There were two guys there. Then he ran out! How will you prove it? Sebastien, there's no point in hiding. My little boy, I know you're scared. But you have to give yourself up. It's the only way. That's horrible for a mother to say. But they told her they found proof. She doesn't know better. We need to go back to the house and find something. OK, but at night, and without you. Shit! My Dad's back. It's from my Mum. - Where have you been? - I was working. At this hour? - You should look after your mother. - He does, leave him. Hi, rat boys. You can't leave her alone for too long in her condition. I'm already doing your job, now you're telling me off. Do you think I enjoy doing extra rounds? You'll end up dying on the job and then we'll be orphans. The money is not for me. There's another child on the way. Nobody forced you to have another. Please, stop arguing. We're not arguing, we're talking. Is it good at the summer play scheme? Yes, but I'd rather stay at home. Me too. Yeah, to hang around the streets. With this shooting business... You be careful too. - I'm going to bed. - Already? Stay a bit longer. I won't see you till Sunday. I have to do the bins at four in the morning. - Are you complaining? - No. - Where are you going? - Sleep. - Where are you going? - Go back to sleep. CRIME SCENE DO NOT OPEN - Are you sure about this? - You don't have to come. - Got the map? - Yeah. The living room is on your right. Look at this. We're not going to find anything. Can we go now? Come and see. Where? - Over there, under the towel. - This one? Well? Can't you see? The bullet went through here. So it's true. OK, we've got enough proof, can we go now? Hold on. Hold on. Hey, check this out! Do you think it's blood? What else? Tomato juice? Shit, those cops are amateurs. Wait until they see this. I'll get a photo of it. There isn't enough light. - Can I use a flash? - No! People will see. We'll tell the journalist, then we'll rub the cops' noses in it. I'll keep looking in here, you check the garage. - No, I'll do in here. - Go on, don't be a pussy. I'm going. Hello, Mr Ligier. Remember me? Kevin, the guy who waters plants. Don't arrest me, I haven't done anything. You can tell the police that. - Sebastien didn't kill him. - Sebastien? - We're looking for proof. - Do you know Sebastien? - He's innocent. - Why do you say that? - Tell me. - I saw him yesterday. Where is he? - Where is he? - I swore I wouldn't tell. - Are you going to arrest me? - Arrest you? Of course not, I'm his sister. - He hasn't got one. - Half-sister. I don't believe you. It's Thomas. Well? Did you find anything? Come and see. Do you know her? Muriel! - So she is your sister. - Half-sister. You should go to the police. I haven't done anything. Seb, you killed your father. You might have blanked it all out, it happens sometimes. But you did what you did. No, we already found proof that he is innocent. So you found proof? You can't go on hiding like this for years. He isn't guilty. - There's a man with him. - A cop? Through the garage! - How much can you pay? - You don't waste time. - 150 euros. - 300. You're good. 200. 250, or I won't bring Sebastien. The bastard. - I'll be discreet. - He won't open. He doesn't know you. - He'll be scared. - I know what to do. You wait here. What if you don't come. - What can you give me? - I'll give you half now. Here. Stay here. I'll be back. See you later. It's him. - It's him. - Who? The man who killed Dad. Stop it! Stop inventing stories. I recognised him. It's him, I swear. And Kevin is his accomplice? That guy wants to find me so he can kill me. We have to go. Kevin has the keys to all your hiding places. You have to prove you're innocent. There's proof here. - When Kevin's gone, I'll show you. - We should just beat him up. Don't you think you're in enough trouble? Thomas! Where are you? Where are you, man? - You're crazy! - I'm not stupid! Where's Seb? I don't like this, but twice is too often. Sir, no... Stop! Give me the money back. Give it back! Wait... - Give it back! - Wait! Are you OK? Do you think he killed him? He beat me up, but I'm OK. You bastard! You betrayed me for money. To Ligier? No, he wants to prove you're not the killer. Don't be stupid. He's a journalist, he thinks your innocent. Of course he thinks he's innocent, he killed him. - Who? - His father. Come and see the proof. - Aren't you a cop? - I'm his half-sister. Don't leave prints. Shit! If the police don't believe me... In the bathroom, there's a hole this big in the chair. - Muriel, I've found Dad's notebook. - We should hand it in. No, if they see me, they'll shoot me. Why would they do that? The other day, that cop Berrigo gave me his number. - We should call him. - Shut up. What's that smell? Can't you smell it? Through the garage! Shit! Let's go around. You go behind the house, I'll try and put it out. - What about the proof? - That's why he started a fire. Shit! - Oh, my God! - Damn! It's Malia's house. She's away. - What are you doing? - Calling Mum, she'll be worried. If you do that, you're not my sister. She's in a real state. Always saying it's her fault. - She wants me to hand myself in. - She thinks you're in danger. Please. OK. Don't leave me alone. - He doesn't want to know you. - It's not fair. I know I made a mistake, but I wanted to help him. I tried to put out the fire, but I couldn't stop it. There's nothing left. Not even the carpet. She's hot. I saw you rubbing against her. Get lost. He doesn't want to see you again. - Sebastien! - It's OK, it's Malia. - I sent a message to her. - Are you nuts? Malia? Yes, I'm hiding at yours, but don't tell anyone. Hang up, quick! Don't believe them. The murderer burnt the house down. Hold on a minute. It's OK, it's from a payphone. You ask for a private chat, and even a video, the cops will never find you. - Sure? - Yes. Malia, can you find a quiet computer in one hour. When you see her name appear... - What's her chat name? - None of your business. - Tell me. - "Trust". Not bad. That way the pervs will leave her in peace. When you see "Trust" appear, click on "add to chat". Click here and you'll be alone. - How do you know all this? - I can't say, you're too young. Around 11 pm last night, the crime scene was set on fire. Was it a coincidence? The fire might have spread through the neighbourhood had it not been for the heroics of the caretaker's son. During the holidays, he waters lawns and looks after people's homes, but last night, despite being injured, he showed bravery and fought the fire alone until help arrived. I was doing the bins when I saw flames. I knew where the hose was so I just ran over there. Tell us, did you see the suspected killer in the area? - He won't say... - No, I'd have recognised him. But I did see a big, bald man, with blue eyes. He smokes all the time. I'm sure he started the fire. See? He's nice. Investigators know that witnesses can be mistaken, especially a young boy like this. They are convinced the young fugitive started the fire. Fire is always a symbol of purification. This fire is a sort of unintentional confession. Children who have committed crimes often believe that by covering or destroying their tracks... Let's search Dad's things. - Shall I switch it on? - Yes. Do you have the code? Try RS... ...7005X. - What's that? - I don't know. He often used it. It worked. "Open mail." The 30th, the day Dad died. "Husson..." "Subject: Danger!" Shall I open it? Yeah. Shit! Shit! - Shit! - Turn it off! I can't! Take out the battery. Too late. The screen has gone blank. - OK, open it up. - Excuse me, sir! - I can open that for you. - Are you sure? Good. - See? - Thank you. I can open that one too. - Hey, kid! - Yeah? Have you got a key for this one? Mori's flat? Yeah. Allow me. It's OK, ma'am. You're quite the hero, aren't you? I'm really interested in what you said on TV. Are you sure you saw a man set fire to the house? Yes, that's why I said it. I get suspicious when a case is too simple. They're not even investigating, they're so sure it was the kid. But what if the murderer isn't who we think it is? - If you see anything, call me. - Sir... Search the houses over there, but keep them surrounded, because if the kid is there he's more chance of getting away. Surround the area. - You got keys for the houses? - Not many. They don't trust poor people. If we don't open the infected mail, it's safe. You sure you don't know Husson? - Shit, there are more. - Don't open them. - It's the only proof we have. - But not if we can't read them. There are mails from Geoffrey, do you know him? Didier Geoffrey was his colleague. But what if we open them and they're infected too? - Don't risk it. - Okay. I'll go to "sent mails". There are your dad's responses to Geoffrey. If your dad opened them, it means he read them without a problem. Here goes... "I don't want to hear about RS7005X ever again." That's the password. Wait here. Come and see. - The RS thingy is a molecule. - What? A molecule. A neutral compound of at least two atoms... - Do you know about this? - Yes, I even studied it. "Tetraperone..." - This is used in Amensidrine! - What? Amensidrine. Haven't you seen it advertised? It's a new miracle product to prevent obesity. What's the link with my dad? - At least it's a clue. - What clue? Shit! I've got a date with Malia. You have to leave. - Don't you want my help? - No, you can go. Let's look at Didier Geoffrey's mails. "I need you" "Are you there? I was worried." I'm happy to see you. - Are you OK? - I don't know. I can't talk loud, I'm in an internet café. I'd like to help you. On my wall, I already told everyone you're innocent. I read it. Thanks. I wish you were here. You know what... Now I ... I'd like you to kiss me. Sir, I'll do that. Thanks. Sir, I can do that for you. Alain replied: "Husson threatened you." So Husson and Ligier are the same person. "Tetraperone is dangerous and we should tell people. If you're too scared to join me, I'll do it alone." Geoffrey: "They are only signs, nothing has been proven. But if you want to be a hero..." - This guy is a bastard. - That's what Alain replied: "Bastard!" - I'll speak to him at the funeral. - Are you serious? It's the only way to find out. He's already tried to chat me up a few times. It's not fair. I can't even go to Dad's funeral. No, it would be too dangerous. It's Kevin. I don't want to see him. He's putting tape everywhere. I'll go. Hide! It's OK, he's alone. And he was putting up police tape. Sebastien? Thanks to me, the cops will think they have already searched here. So you can relax. Nobody will come looking here. You see? I'm helping you whether you like it or not. And I've got an idea for the funeral. Mum, you and I haven't had any time alone. I need to talk to you. Sebastien isn't guilty. The police have fingerprints and witnesses... Mum, I think he is innocent... Have you been in touch with him? This is Mr Hubac, he's agreed to defend Sebastien. If you know something, I'm here to help you. Out there on his own, he's at risk... No! I don't know anything. This way, please. A word for the press. - Any news from your son? - Leave us alone! - Please... - For today at least! We don't want the press against us. We all know how much science owes to Alain. And now he's gone, all of us appreciate what he taught us. That's Didier Geoffrey, I met him at Dad's house. Thomas is a genius, I didn't think it would work. ...invited me to join the famous Lab 15 team. And it is thanks to him that I learnt the virtues he had: Patience and perseverance. What are you doing? I'm filming it so I can watch it again. I always told Sebastien not to blame his father, and that our problems weren't about him. This is not your fault. So you liked him a lot. He always said you two made a good team. He even said I should work with you. Your sister is hot. She's a real tease. Why did you stop working with him? - Did he tell you that? - Yes. Little scientific differences. - But we were still friends. - Will you tell me about it? - We could meet. - Well played. Why did you say I lit the fire? I saw you do it. Listen, if you say anything like that again, I'll get your family. Your brothers, your mother. Is that what you want? You're back late, Kevin. There was too much work. Your brothers were slapped by a man in the street. They don't even know why. What sort of world is this? It's OK, I'll protect them. Alain encapsulated that research, and now he'll be sorely missed. Have you thought it over, Mr Vermillard? Shit! "Come quick." - Going out? - Yeah. To get something from a friend's house. At this time of night? Which friend? Now you care about what I do? Is this an interrogation? For once, I stayed home to see you, so let's not argue. Yes, for once. The presence of RS7005X in Tetraperone is dangerous. You're putting jobs at risk. - I'm thinking about the public. - So are we. You're stopping progress because of some hypothetical risk. - No, I say it's a certainty. - Your colleagues don't. And not only a few. - I intend to convince you. - You won't manage it. That's a mistake. - Is that a threat? - You leave me no choice. Get out of here! Damn! Shit! No way! Isn't that proof? Only that they fought the day before. It's all about drugs and money. They killed my dad to shut him up. We'll speak for him. We can't unless we have proof. You can't lose this. Make a copy. OK? No need. I'll email it. My mother. "Are you angry? Come home." She's a pain. What are you doing here? Me? I'm here to play. They have games I can't afford, and they're not here. Don't tell my mum. - What did you steal? - Nothing, I swear. Wait there! Don't run away. You're coming with me. I'll take you to see a judge who can put you in a home. Please, sir, I won't do it again. OK, do you know where the little criminal is? Why would I know? If you tell me, I'll let you go. - Let's take you in. - No, I saw him. You saw him? Where? It was yesterday. - Where? - I'll show you. He's good. I'd have never thought it. We can't stay here anymore. - Where are we going? - How should I know? Keep your head down! - Have you got a boyfriend? - It's not the moment. - None of your business. - I'm only asking. If you don't want to talk... I just broke up with him. That's why I didn't go away on holiday. I don't know how, but I never choose the right guy. - Why are you stopping? - I can't drive all night. - Let's go see Mum. - She thinks you're guilty! I don't care, I have to tell her the truth. About what we saw in the house and the video of Ligier and Dad. - The cops are there. - Stop! - Hello, Mum, it's me. - Where are you? I need to see you, not at the house. You know where he is, don't you? No, but I know he's innocent. Tell me, is he OK? He's innocent, Mum. I can explain. Do you remember the café where we met with Manu? - By City Hall? - Yes. Meet me there tomorrow morning at seven. Alone, OK? Mum! Mum... Mum! Don't hurt him. Sebastien! OK, let go of me! Sebastien trusted you. He's innocent. Muriel, shall I show you all the proof the police have? They're wrong. Look at this. Look! Your interview will be filmed. As a minor, you can refuse. Do you refuse? OK... Let's talk about you. Do you have a lawyer? If not, you'll be appointed one. Do you accept the facts? If I tell the truth, you won't believe me. Then you'll tell me to shut up, so... You're making things worse. Sebastien... Sebastien! If you don't cooperate, it will be worse. And if I get angry... To start with, you'll have medical. No need, I'm fine. Do you know what you're facing? For a crime, at your age, we can hold you for 48 hours. Then you'll go before the judge. Sebastien! If the penalty is longer than 7 years, and this one is, you can be remanded in custody for up to 12 months. You could spend a year in jail waiting for the trial. You can't stop me from seeing my son! - Sorry, ma'am. No visits. - I have something... - Sit down. - It's impossible. You need special permission from the judge. Why didn't you tell me? You said it would be better for him. Please, keep your voices down. We can hear everything. Sebastien? Can you hear me? It's me. It's Mummy. I love you! Don't worry, we'll get you out of there. Sebastien, I'm your lawyer, Mr Hubac. - Don't talk if I'm not here. - I didn't kill my father. We'll defend you well. I've won worse cases than yours. No, don't go. I'm Seb's friend. The police have got him. Sebastien... has been arrested? Are you sure? What can we do? This isn't a children's home. You need to complain about that to the judge. This is a prison. Will I be with criminals? Why? Would you like that? There isn't a special wing for juveniles. Don't complain, you get a cell to yourself. In you go. We'll call this the juvenile wing. - Hello. - Hello. - It's good of you to see me. - I liked Alain so much. Thank you. Tell me about Alain's work and the RS7005X. That way it'll feel like he's still here. That was a project which... wasn't really completed. - Will you still show me? - I don't have any of it now. I wasn't in agreement with Alain on it. Thanks. She hasn't got time for flirting. Be patient, if she did that to me, I'd fall for it. He can't resist. I'd really love to see the office. I remember going there as a girl. Will you take me? Yes. Of course. Now, tell me about you. It's in the bag, man. He's even getting a hard-on. How can you know that? - Pick it up discreetly and look, - Me? Go on. Well? Did you see? No, they're too far away. And now they're arguing. I said Alain told me he was afraid of Husson's threats. I called him a coward. - You shouldn't have said that. - But we don't need him anyway. I've got Alain's lab card, we can look in his computer. No need. Stop here. I've got the code, and I connected to the server. Awesome! You're good, man. Yeah, but it's too late. Data from before his death has been replaced by downloaded films. There must be a backup copy somewhere. Yes, the program makes backup copies every hour. But now it's backing up films, and the new files replace the old ones. So all that's left are the films. I don't believe this. It's Didier. He's sorry he got angry. He wants to meet. "I've always liked you a lot. I understand. I want to help you." - He can go to hell. - No! You've got him by the balls. Don't be rude. OK, but what if he's got copies of their work? And he wants to screw you... That's enough! I'm innocent! Let me out! - I'm innocent! - Shut up! I'm innocent! Shut your mouth! - I'm innocent! - Shut up! I'm innocent! I'm innocent. It would be helpful if your son calmed down a bit. Yes, I'll try again. But he won't listen. He swears he's telling the truth. What we need to win the case isn't truth. It's doubt. I'd rather see you alone. - He's one of the best. - It's OK, I understand. Sorry. It's nothing personal. Isn't Muriel here? I'm only allowed one visit. And that's more than most. Your lawyer doesn't want to believe me. It's his job to plan for everything. But does he believe me or not? He believes you. He doesn't believe you... He doesn't know. And do you believe me? If you scream, I'll throw you to the dogs! Help! Little shit! Quick! He tried to hang himself. That's a lie! - What? - Tried to hang himself! It's not true! Suicides in the prison are bad for us! - He tried to kill me! - Shut up! And a kid as well! Why did you do that? I didn't do anything. The guard tried to kill me. You have to be strong. OK? I'm here now. I'll help you. Will they send me back? I don't want to go back there. We're trying to get you placed in a home. But they'll try to kill me as well. What should I do? - I'll try to speak to the judge. - What good will it do? The law allows them to grant you parental custody. That means you would have him. With guarantees and controls. But that will require a gesture from us. OK, what do I have to do? Not you, Sebastien. He's refusing to talk. The judge thinks he'll break in custody. For him to change his mind, he needs to hear a confession. A confession? But he keeps saying he's innocent. And I want to believe him. If he's got it, she'll get it. Have you seen how he looks at her? His eyes are popping out of his head. He thinks she's hot, which is a good start. Let's go. - How did you get out tonight? - I said I was sleeping at yours. - What if your dad checks up? - No, he's looking after Mum. Damn, if she doesn't calm down, this won't work. Don't worry, this guy is kinky. Look at him. Let's go. Thomas, I need you for the computer. - There's nothing in it. - There's another hard drive. I showed him the film to prove Seb is innocent. He panicked, which means he recognised Ligier. He came to him this afternoon. He wants Alain's work too. - Didier said there's a hard drive. - Where? In his desk drawer. Alain didn't trust shared networks, so every night, before leaving, he copied work onto a hard drive which he then put away. And Didier told Ligier this? He's a shit. We have to get it before Ligier does. That means now. But isn't it dangerous? I've got Didier's codes and Alain's card. Lie down, dog! Be quiet. - We should have brought poison. - No! That's sick! - Yeah, but it works. - Let's go! This is it! I only came here once, but I remember. We only have 30 seconds to switch off the alarm. - I can't see it. - Is this it? Yes. - 874A. - Hurry up. - Shit! What was it again? - 874A. Hurry up! We're in! Are you sure about this? Don't you think this is a bit risky? Don't go too close to the window. - Could this be it? - Yes. Can we go now? Let's check it's the right one. - But the screen will light up. - We have to cover it. Quick! - Oh, shit! Look at the dog. - Seems Ligier did bring poison. Kevin, hold this for me. - I forgot my blouse... - No! There's no time. Mum? It's OK, she's not here. - Thomas? - Yes? - Can you lend me a top? - Sure. - Here. - Thanks. - Bastard! Did you get a sniff? - Yeah. It works! "Hard drive: Alain Vermillard." That's it. "Vechborg"! "Tetraperone." It's a letter to the Vechborg lab. "Following my work on Tetraperone, I must inform you of the dangerous side effect of Amensidrine. I wish to inform you that someone working for Vechborg Laboratories as an industrial security agent came to threaten me with acts of intimidation." The prisoner is not dangerous, so you can remove the cuffs. You can wait here. - Don't argue with the judge. - I thought it wasn't good to lie. My little angel. It's the only way to get you out of prison. So, around seven o'clock on July 30th, you arrived at your father's home? Yes. You were about to go on holiday with him, and you were angry because you didn't want to go. In anger, you kicked a tin can and you saw your father inside. Once inside, you shouted that you didn't want to go to Italy. And you argued, correct? Is that correct? Answer her, if you want to get out. He sent you to your room, you ran out. You returned with the gun. Your father was facing his desk. You fired, killing him instantly. Yes. Do you agree? Sign here. Your Honour, we are confident that Sebastien poses no danger and we request parental custody during the trial. We guarantee he can be entrusted to his mother, subject to any conditions you wish to impose. There are too many journalists at home. Claire is lending us her house for August. You won't be afraid there. Why did you lie? Why make me sign? We're going to build your defence... - I won't go! - Sebastien! - Stop. - Hold it, you. Let go! You're not going back. We're just going to get a prison discharge. I need to tell the judge I lied. Now they won't look for the killer. Dad was right, there's a dangerous drug. Listen to me. Given your situation, unless you calm down, I can't defend you. Is that what you want? Come back inside. You can't tell anyone you're here. No computer, no phone... But how can I defend myself now? - The lawyer will defend you. - By saying I'm guilty? Being here is no better than jail. What? There's TV, DVDs, books... Sebastien, you're accused of a serious crime. I know I haven't taken it well, but I'm doing my best. Oh, my God. Go in there. Mum, I've been looking everywhere for you. - Is he here? - Did you tell anyone else? We've found Alain's hard drive, the threats and all his work. I don't care! What good will it do? - Seb, when they see... - Stop. He's confessed. But it wasn't him! What else can I do? I've take time off to look after him. I hired the most expensive lawyer! I've done everything the judge said! If he's innocent, does it mean the killers are after him? What if they find out you have evidence against them? - He's innocent, we can prove it. - Oh, God. We must trust the lawyer. A criminal child can hide behind denial, but once they are brought back to reality by adults, they can find it hard to back down and they sometimes feel trapped, so they see death as a way out. The fact Sebastien tried to commit suicide is symbolic, and it preceded his confession. It makes sense now. What do you know? What do they know? But he confessed. They might have tortured him. I don't know! Doesn't that happen sometimes? Damn! We did all this and now he's not even allowed to speak. No, we just have to wait. We're from a council estate. They won't let us help. Can you copy the hard drive for me? I think it's encoded. - But we can't do anything now. - For the lawyer. The lawyer thinks that Sebastien is guilty. - I know. What else can we do? - We can find Ligier. We've got his number, we could find his address. Damn, you're good. "The number you have dialled is not in service." Damn it! He's deactivated the line. What would you do if you were hiding? OK. I have to go. And, guys... Don't do anything stupid. She's even sexier when she's sad. Why don't we follow her? We might find Seb. How? Running along behind her car? Mum? You're home. Hervé is a bastard. Come and console me. It's a good thing I have you. Yes, but I can't stay long, Mum. Where are you going? You're not leaving me? I don't know what I'd do if you weren't here. Sebastien, you have to eat. Listen, I called the lawyer. I said Muriel had new information, he was very interested. It's too late. I've confessed now. I have "guilty" on my forehead. You can always withdraw your confession later. Don't worry. It's the tutor. Don't be rude. Answer everything he asks you. - Hello. - Hello, madam. Come in. - Everything OK? - Yes. Hello. - Everything OK? - No. Has he been out? There's always someone with him? There's no contact with the outside? And he isn't violent or particularly aggressive? - Is it going to take a long time? - It depends on the judge. Or on the jury, given how serious it is. Because you confessed, they will probably put you in a JDC. - A what? - Juvenile Detention Centre. - Back to prison? - No, not yet. As long as you behave yourself. I'll come back tomorrow. - Goodbye. - Thank you, sir. Are you happy now? Hello. - I was hoping I'd see you again. - Me too. How are you? I need to find this Husson guy. How can I find him? I don't know, I wiped all records of him. I'm sorry. He works for Vechborg. We could try to get his address. But they'll say they don't know him. Please don't take any risks. - We can't just do nothing. - You're right, I'll help you. Let's spend the evening together. No, I can't. Some other time. No, he contacted me. He said it seems suspicious and he's ready to work on it. I know, but I want to be sure. Yes, I'll call when I've seen him. A private detective? That's ridiculous. We have to be sure. - Mum... - I'm just doing everything I can. Mum, this isn't America. This is France, but it's important. - He just wants your money. - He's a professional, he knows where to look, and that can only help our case. When he called, I thought: "this is the good news." She's gone out. I know you heard. I saw you. - What next? A clairvoyant? - It reassures her. - Can you keep a secret? - You found Ligier? This is the dossier. Nobody can know you have this. If the lawyer doesn't act, I'll go to the press. You can use the computer, but use a privacy shield so they can't trace your IP address. You have the password and the code. Can you leave me alone? Please? Hide the computer. Mum's back with the detective. That's Ligier's accomplice! - Sure? - Yes. You hide in the cellar. Quick! Whatever happens, don't come out. Mum! Seb has run away! I was about to call the police. - What? - I was distracted by a power cut. I didn't think he'd run away. - Where did he go? - I don't know! - Who are you anyway? - The detective. - You'll help us find him. - I don't run after kids. I need to call my assistant. We should call the police, or they'll think it was us and they'll definitely take him away. The judge, who took the decision alone, considered there to be no risk in granting parental custody. Now the suspected killer is once again at large. This legal oversight raises many questions... - Malia, if you hear from him... - Why would I? If you do, you tell me, OK? Aiding a criminal is an offence. This breaks the trust between client and lawyer, so I can no longer defend this child. We can ask ourselves if the authorities did their job. Giving Sebastien back to his mother after he killed his father was like an Oedipus complex... Why are you watching this trash? We suggest making children legally responsible at 12 years old. And we are considering making it possible to arrest children... I was interested in that. - Where are you going? - I think I'll go out for a bit. No, stay with me. Please. - I don't want to be alone. - OK. - Are you alone? - Yes. Thanks. I sent Alain's credit card to your friend on holiday. I asked her to withdraw cash and pass it on. - The cops will follow the trail. - It won't work for long. So we have to be quick. Vechborg won't answer my calls. I'll send them a threat: Either I get Ligier's address, or I blow the whistle. They won't look at the work. - If Geoffrey gives it to them... - He won't do that. I'm not going to ask him. - Hello, sir. - Hello. - For Vechborg from Didier Geoffrey. - Thank you. - OK? - Yes. Bye. What if Didier denies it? According to Kevin, no one can resist me. Love is so stupid. Didier! Look out! - Are you OK? - I'm fine. He almost killed me. - He's OK, thanks. - Thank you. Thank you. Didier, listen to me. - Later. - It's important. In that case, tell me after a glass of champagne. I think this was my fault. I sent Vechborg all Alain's files and the threats. To be sure they'd read it, I said it was from you. I didn't think... That car earlier and now... - I'm sorry. - This can't be true. - You're crazy. - I didn't think it was dangerous. But this proves that Vechborg are in on it. I just want to save my brother. Now do you understand why I backed away? You can call me a coward, but I'm no hero. I didn't imagine it would come to this... Now you're going to listen to me! You go to Vechborg, and you tell them that I've nothing to do with this! I don't care how, just make sure you convince them! OK, I will. - What about Sebastien? - I don't care. Don't say that. At least talk to the police. Stop fucking around with my life! Get out of my sight! And he said he loved me. That's adults for you. Do you think they were ever like us? That's what I ask myself sometimes. But you can trust me. We're going to get that Ligier! - Have you found him? - Almost. You'll see my plan tomorrow. What will you do? It's a surprise. No. I'm sorry. I'm not ready for... - I need to go and see Seb. - Where is he? I'm not even allowed to know that. You won't tell? You won't go and see him? - He's hiding in the cellar. - In the same house? Awesome! And those idiots are out looking everywhere! - Is that a threat. - You give me no choice. Get out! Cut the end part. - OK. Shall I put you in copy? - I'll dictate. "Mr Husson, please watch this video extract. You're the star, filmed by Alain Vermillard. There are five copies. I know it could interest the police, but I'm prepared to sell them. Decide quickly, send an email or call me." Put the house number. - Are you sure? - Trust me. Send it. Not bad! Nice! There's some nice shit in here. - What are you doing? - Chatting with my mum. - I thought she did your head in. - I'm pretending to be other men. She's sad, and I know what she likes to hear... She doesn't know it's you? Yes, it's me. The other films? It depends how much you can pay. Yes, we can meet. But in public. I don't want to get beaten up again. Yes, I know it. OK, in three hours' time. Are you crazy? Mr Berrigo? Do you remember me? The kid who waters the lawns and has all the keys. Yes. Sebastien is innocent. I can prove it. And you can catch the real killer. I'm meeting him. Café Antwerp in three hours. He's not here yet. Don't show yourself. Do you know what you're doing? It's OK, you're here. - Where's the fugitive? - Nobody knows. Do you want to get him killed? Listen, I've known he was innocent for some time now. I want the killer. I know, he'll be here in five minutes. - Unless you're still here. - Are you stupid? He was being careful because the kid confessed, but now he'll be panicking. He might find your friend and he might kill him. So tell me where he is. Not helping someone in danger is a crime. If I tell you, will you arrest him? I want to save him. Let me out! Let me go! - He's in Vernison. - Help! Help! Shut up! I'm warning you, I'll send the videos to the press. - Hasn't he got them? - His mate has them. Step on it, will you. - I withdrew 20 euros, now what? - Spend it. Now send the card to Benja in Nice. I did. We'll send those cops crazy. - If I go to prison... - I'll come and visit you. You won't be allowed. We could ask to get married, then they would let us. - Where is the cellar. - Tell him. I don't know. We'll wait here and block the door. I think someone's coming! Don't say a word. Sebastien, are you OK? Where are the videos? Now you can cry. Where are they? Your mate said you have them. Which mate? The videos aren't here. - Where are they? - At a friend's. You got a phone? Where is it? - Where is it? - There. Tell him to bring them here, without talking to anyone. Put it on loudspeaker. - It's me, bring the videos. Quick! - What videos? You know! Bring the videos. I'll need at least an hour. Excuse me. How can I call the police? Why did you kill my father? I didn't kill anyone. It was all your fault. - Me? - It's my job to protect clients. Your dad wanted to stop their new drug. He'd found out it was dangerous. Isn't there enough unemployment? We only wanted to frighten him off. Then you showed up with a gun! Otherwise, it wouldn't have happened. He got angry and I threatened him with your gun. - Then it went off. - You put my prints on it. No, you did that. - Where's your friend? - He said an hour. Call him back. Don't touch the boy! You're surrounded! Help me! I swear, if you say one word against me, I'll kill your mother and your brothers. I have contacts. Nobody will believe you anyway. So, if you love your family... I'm a cop! Berrigo! I called it in! They're in the cellar. Let's go! Kevin! You OK? - The cops were already on the way. - But how? - Probably Berrigo. - Yeah, probably. And I was worried about you, so I called your dad. Dad! 23 people in the internet café witnessed the confession... But he wanted to kill me and Seb. His lawyers claim it was not premeditated, but an argument which ended in tragedy. The former police officer set up a business four years ago to protect the pharmaceutical industry from industrial espionage. But how much did Vechborg Laboratories know about his methods? It seems Alain Vermillard wanted to inform us about risks that could arise from the irresponsible use of this remarkable medicine which we are about to put on the market. Let me stress that we were never aware of this research. And I have therefore decided to postpone all sales of Amensidrine until we can clear up any doubts about it, and I have given the research project to an independent scientist, the renowned Didier Geoffrey, who worked alongside Alain Vermillard. I accepted out of a sense of duty to science and to continue Alain Vermillard's good work. I think he was like me when he was younger. - And we'll become like him. - Don't say that. At least Amensidrine will be monitored now, thanks to Alain. Do you believe what they say? ...the double victim of this tragedy. He is now safe and sound, but there will be questions about how the investigation went so wrong. Investigators are not trained how to deal with juveniles, and yet this is a complicated age group. And that is why, this case, which could have been a terrible legal injustice, leads us to demand that specialists, such as myself, are present from the beginning... That guy does my head in! Excuse me, please. You all have to leave now. He needs to rest. Madame, you too, please. He needs me. I'd like to stay for a while. Please, ask her to leave too. You can come back in five minutes. I want to be left alone to rest. OK, I'll tell her you need to rest. I didn't want to upset them. "Are you crying?" "No." SUBTITLES: RED BEE MEDIA FRANCE
