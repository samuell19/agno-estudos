Good, little one, give your dad a kiss. Don't cry, my son, be nice. Are you going to be gone long? - I don't think so. Bye. I have to say goodbye. See you soon. See you soon. Hey, friend. This is the famous Samuel... Let's see. 100, 200, 400, only 900 dollars. Great, we chose a poor job. Every day gets harder. Exactly. The 5 most important ones are missing. The situation won't change until we've caught them. Well, they won't escape us. And we will find them. Nice of you to say that. The hunt is over, they won't escape from us Yes, I've already seen them.. Just a few steps away. - Why just a few steps? Welcome, what are you drinking? - Give me a whisky. Immediately. Sorry not to take advantage, but I'm in a hurry. At least you could close the window, I don't want to get pneumonia. Sheriff, have the money ready for the bounty - How much do you want? 15000 for the murderers of the Clayton family. What's up? Why are you standing still? I've got a great idea in my head. We'll soon be rich. Is it possible to know what you have in mind? - You'll get it soon. Don't turn around! Well, here we are. Stop! Come on! Here, Sheriff, he's the Claytons' killer. He confessed it to me himself. So it's you? Didn't you hear? Watch out Sheriff, he's dangerous. He almost killed me. It's worth the risk for the bounty, isn't it? Come in! I wasn't thinking about the money when I grabbed this bandit here. Who's paying by the way, you? I pay personally. Look out the window. Does that mean that those there... - Exactly. Well, they were unlucky. These are the Clayton killers. Too bad for you, you came 1 day late. Oh, always the same bad luck. Certainly. But sheriff, you must understand a joke! Take off the belt. Well done, a joke, right? They were also strangers, but who can tell me, that you weren't involved in the Claytons' murder? I assure you we have nothing to do with the murder of the Claytons. Tell him too. Why are you laughing? Unlucky, nothing more. Hey, Sheriff, when are we getting out of here? Get that out of your head, also because the hanged ones have protested their innocence until the end. Good job Johnny, that was a great idea. If you didn't like it, you should have told me earlier. Enough, shut up and untie me. Howdy Bob. - Howdy Rogers. Do you have it? Yes, I'll give it to you right away. And tell me, have tempers calmed down after the prisoners were hung? Not quite, even Clayton wouldn't find out what signature is his. Very nice, a perfect fake. Fine, and now to Jefferson. Don't speak so loud, I've got 2 strangers inside. Better to wait a few days. until people have calmed down a bit. Maybe you're right, I'm talking to... Who owns this gun? One of the prisoners? Which one of you two does this gun belong to? Didn't you hear me? It's mine, why? Where did you get it? Amigo, don't you think you want to know too much? Why are you so curious? First tell me who you are. You are right. My name is Steve Rogers. May I ask how it got into your hands? And can you tell us why you are SO curious? For personal reasons. This pistol has a long history. We found it... a long time ago. Is that all you can tell me? yeah, that's all, right Johnny? Exactly, that's all. His name is Johnny. ...And further? Johnny...Johnny and that's that. Yes, that's Murphy's gun. What was the use of all that, you can't catch up with the past. What does he want, should we buy his silence, or does he want revenge? It's not him. Calm down, it's 2 strangers who found the gun. A boy? Forget what you thought. It's not his son. The only thing that surfaced is this gun. The memory. Don't think about the pistol anymore. Chance brought them both to Blackstone. The Murphys adopted your son. They didn't tell you the truth, for fear you'd come looking for me and force me to kill him as you told his father. Anyway, I want to see this stranger. I tell Bob to let them go. They will leave the place, rest assured. Hey Fred, what did I tell you. You are 2 lucky guys. But take my advice: get the hell out of here. Did you hear, we better listen to him. Sure. You must thank Mr. Rogers, If he hadn't put in a good word for you, I would never have forgotten that you wanted to swindle 15'000 dollars bounty. Thank him on my behalf. Yeah sure... If I were you I would disappear. AS soon as I could. Is it possible that you have such a bad opinion of us? If it were up to me, you would stay here for a good while. I don't think the sheriff likes us very much. Listen, I don't like this place. Let's have a drink and get started now looking for Logan and Anderson. DO you have any idea where they are? Thanks for your brilliant idea! Stop it, it's the first time we've had bad luck. Off to Lexington to collect the $900. Don't worry, they're waiting for us. What's going on? -There they are, |I see Anderson. Like in Burlington? Like in Burlington! I'll throw a drink for everyone. Stop! Wasn't a good idea hiding in Blackstone. What do you want from me? I just want to know where Logan is. I don't know who you're talking about. Johnny, don't you think that you made a mistake? I don't think so, I swear it's him. Yes, me too, it really is him. Would you tell us where Logan is? I don't know. We parted just past Lexington. Tell me Fred, do you believe in this story? Not quite. I think we need to refresh your memory. I was telling the truth, I don't know anything. Okay... If you don't like this game, let's move on. Get up! Where is he? I already said that we broke up. I'm not joking this time, sheriff, you have to pay us. I would advise you to look at this guy's visage, I am convinced that this is the same person as on the profile here. Not that they're twins, right? There is no doubt. Hey, Sheriff, that's $2,000. I don't have it here, you have to wait. Don't worry, we can wait. One day, two? Don't worry, I'll call you as soon as I have the money. Let's hope it's soon. Goodbye. You idiot, I told you not to show your face around here. Come in. Are you locking me in? Did they ask you something? They made me tell them where Logan is. Let me go to the hut, and we will receive them as they deserve. You've gone nuts. It is me who goes to them and it is me who decides what we do. Anderson should have been back by now. We can't wait any longer. Lost your speech Ericson? Why did you kill them without robbing them? I don't know. So, we're taking the dead to the sheriff now and who knows, maybe he gives us a bonus. Why don't we get them? No rush if they have a bounty on their heads, we know where to find them. Four! Take a look outside, there's a whole family of corpses. It's the Ericsons, Sheriff. What do you know about all these corpses? Less than the motive. We were too far away to recognize them, but we saw them. We followed Jack Logan, Anderson's buddy. Ask him, he probably knows the others too. Yes... ...but are you sure? Allow me, gentlemen, are they all dead on the cart? Do you think they're having a siesta? Did you kill them? No, not them. It doesn't matter. I'm sure you'll kill others. Allow me to introduce myself: my name is Jonathan Ritchoff. My friends call me "Funny.‚Äù By the way, who pays for the funerals? Take the dead and go! Yes, immediately. Come on, let's hear what the prisoner says. Did you hear what they say about Anderson? What do you know about these murderers? Nothing. I don't know Jack Logan, nor anyone else in this damn place. Why don't you let me do it, Sheriff, I refreshed his memory before. Wait a minute, I'm the sheriff here. If you want to know more, Sheriff, come with us. They're hiding in Pearson's cabin. Yes, but I'm going there alone. You stay in here. Another time. And what have we done wrong? You stay here until I have proof that you told me the truth. Lock them up nicely. How nice they are. My ideas don't work, your ones are great, congratulations. Here comes Bob. You have to get out of here as soon as possible. What happened? Two bounty hunters took me to Anderson. They saw him and now they know him. Did you say two? Yes. Then they've been chasing him since Big Springs. If you could put those two out of action, I'd be more reassured. Try to forget them, the whole village is upset. Tonight you pack your things and hide in the mine. What can we do for Anderson? He's safe with me. Do not worry. What's the matter? I think about what would have happened to us if we had arrived here 2 days earlier and what they would have done to us instead of those three. Don't you think that's funny? Not at all. I'm also sure that these poor bastards were innocent. I think so too. They must have come here to get the bounty also. This is the first time I'm glad I was late. Friends, I have bad news for you; I was in the hut and didn't find anybody. Well, and, what does that mean, "bad news"? That means you stay here until I find out more. Don't you think, Sheriff, that you have been used like we have and can't keep us here, because you have no evidence against us. Let us go or we won't believe that you are as honest as you appear. I believe these men are honest. It is unlikely for them to bring Ericson's bodies here after they killed them. Yes you are right. Here you go, these are the bounties. Mr. Rogers advanced them to you. Isn't there anything else, Sheriff? Don't forget not to leave the place until I have spoken to the judge. You can count on that. I'd like to know what you think of the sheriff. In which context? About the story that nobody was at the hut? Exactly. And you, what do you think is behind these dead people? Cemetery? NO, I see money, lots of money. Good evening gentlemen. I was expecting you. Keep the shovels away. The worms have to wait a few more years. Look at them, they are much calmer now, almost as so as nothing had happened. Fred, isn't that Mr. Rogers down there? Hello. Mr Rogers. Hello. Thanks for advancing us the bounty. It doesn't matter. But it is important for us. I make myself available for everything you need. We won't forget that, very nice. Hello, come on. It's the younger one, right Steve? Why... I don't know, I can't explain it to you. I had a strange feeling when I saw him. Still with your absurd hunches. Be reasonable. What would your son want here after 20 years? Yes, I know, maybe you're right. I am not interested anymore in the land or money. For me, these 20 years have been nothing but suffering. You amaze me. I thought you put the pangs of conscience aside. You always got it wrong in your judgment of me, didn't you, Steve? We are both accomplices in a murder, there's no excuse for that. But I paid dearly for my mistakes. And also because of my love for you, I had to give up my son. Believe me, those two have nothing to do with this story. And that's all. They found the gun, they are nothing more than two adventurers. Now they have collected the 2'000 dollars reward and will leave again. I'm sure they'll go away. You will see. We're not moving from here. Sooner or later we'll get Jack Logan. And like I said, there's a lot of money in this dump. I don't know exactly where yet, but I'm sure there's a lot of it and we'll find it. Let's go to Pearson's cabin to take a look. No, there is nobody there. Either the sheriff lied and let her go, or he really didn't find her. Do you think that the sheriff...? Why not...? Sure why not... I'll have a drink and you go do the shopping. Hey Fred, 100K, don't you think she's pretty? What do you say? Yes. And you stay so calm? Why? Do you want me to throw myself off the balcony? Leave it, I'll go myself. Say Fred, you who are older than me and have more experience with such decent women, tell me how I can get to know her. I would go downstairs and introduce myself. I'm serious Fred, please tell me how to do it. Alright boy, listen carefully: I find to conquer a girl there are no rules other than courtesy and friendliness. Then nobody can resist you. Politeness and kindness, that's exactly what I was thinking. Thank you Fred Fred, that doesn't work. And I'm telling you, we're all going to be slaughtered, do you understand? That's it. And what can we do? We have no choice but to join forces to prevent family after family from being killed. I ask you what mysterious value have our lands to these people? Who is behind these strangers who came to us? It's better for me not to investigate. It's very convenient and only for cowards. Or have you already forgotten the Claytons and the Harrisons? We've already spoken to the sheriff. And what did he do? We can't sit back and wait for them to Kill us. We must do everything in our power to defend our children and our families. You are right. I was there when the Harrisons were killed. I've always been sure that these lands hide a secret. You can count on my help, Amigo. Thanks for the offer. You are a stranger, aren't you? Are you drinking something? Whisky. Two. -Immediately My name is Danton. Fred Danton. And I am Forrest. Just call me Thomas. These are my children, Elisabeth and Dario. Pleased. This amigo knows our concerns and has offered to help us. Johnny, come and introduce yourself. Coming. Johnny and Mr Forrest. And count on me too. Thanks. Pleased. The joy is all mine, Senorina. I appreciate your kindness. Is there anything else, or is that all? No, that's all, dad. Then we drive. I'll help you. I'll be waiting for you at home. With pleasure. We will come, and in the meantime keep your eyes peeled. And get the guns ready. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. I'm really grateful, Fred. That was a very good idea of you, if you hadn't introduced me... You don't need to thank me. I am interested in this family because I think that they will receive a visit from Jack Logan and his friends. I was also surprised by your kindness. Let's not lose sight of the sheriff's office. The sheriff's office... We need to tell him about Anderson. Pearson... What's going on? The sheriff comes riding up. Congratulations Fred. You were right. Well, that's a tough one. I'm sure there's a lot of money behind it. Even a lot of money. What are we waiting for? We have to find out where it is. And I think I know where. Judge wright... What's the matter with you? I have to say you are the only honest person in this place. Yes, a hideout for bandits. And you do nothing to eliminate them. What can I do, I'm alone. Bring me evidence, and I promise you that I'll put them in the hole, no matter who it is. The lands of the murdered farmers, has anyone registered it? No one brought me an act of purchase if you allude to that. So basically they all died for nothing? Did someone kill them out of revenge? No... ...neither the Claytons nor the Harrisons could have had enemies. Mr. Wright, if anyone presents themselves as a buyer of these lands, could you please notify me? I am staying at the hotel. I will. Count on it. Goodbye Mr. Wright. Goodbye. Where the hell did I put it? That's good Elisabeth, nice to see you laugh. The responsibility for the ranch and the threats of those men worried me a lot. However, today I feel good. Your visits always put me at ease. Only rest? No, that's just what I said. I feel well. Elisabeth, I never thought that your happiness makes me happy too. Johnny... when are you going to change your life? Right now I don't intend to die. This is no joke, I'm serious. What are you talking about? About your life, You are in the midst of dangers. You tempt fate with everything. How can you be so careless? It's true before I knew you, I never thought of myself, today it's worth it. That s, if you want it. And how I want it... Hey, you two! Here we come. Don't you think it's dinner time? Oh I forgot to cook something. Mmm, this woman! Greetings, Mr. Forrest. How are you, Johnny? Anything to drink? Never turned down a drink in my life. I'm glad. You didn't show up. I think they have better things to do and decided to leave us alone. No, I'll bring them or we'll end up without a plate. No, you sit down. full service. Daniel, are you ready for marriage. You would make a great husband. I'm the last to laugh, during my supper. To not being burnt. Even if his food is bad, act like you like it. And your ride? Turned out well, better than before. Elisabeth was much brighter today. We are all happier now. Cheers! Here's to yours! Well, I don't know how it tastes, but you have to eat it, with all the trouble I've put in. Never thought how hard that would be. Watch out! It smells wonderful. It's one of my favorite dishes. Compliments, you've been chosen as personal chef. Good, now enjoy it. Uh... It's delicious. Delicious. Very good. Fred... What's up? You didn't tell me what the judge said. I don't remember, let me sleep. I had a nice day... next time you'll come with me. Where to? To the Forresters. It's a really likeable family. They asked about you at great length. When are you coming? I asked when you were coming. Let me sleep. By the way, do you know that nothing has been heard about Logan? I had a nice day! She was so cute, Elisabeth. We ate lunch. Fred... What's up? Sorry, I just wanted to ask you since you have more experience, how do you feel when you're in love? One suffers from insomnia. Goodbye. Hey, they're coming. Logan... The time has come. How was Dodge City? Let's go. I want to have fun too, boys. I'm still here too. Bob, we have to get out, they're all dead. Everyone? How could this happen? The two bounty hunters surprised us. You shouldn't have come here, if they saw us, we're suspicious. Don't be under any illusions, they know everything, I'm sure. Head to the mine and await my orders. Meanwhile I'll talk to Rogers. Take as many men as you need and come back as soon as possible. Last time I heard from them they were in Tucson, and that's where you'll find them. I don't think it will take you long to be back. Are you really sure this is the best solution? Do you know how much bounty is on their heads? Yeah, a bunch of dollars. I guess our friends won't miss it to collect the funds. And we know all too well what happened to those who have tried. Good, I hope you're not wrong. What should I do, after the two villains know everything about me? After returning from Tucson, you stay at the mine. As soon as you're done with those two, you say you handed over the prisoner. Nobody can object. Agreed Rogers, but you'll stop by my office tomorrow. If we need to change our plans, you'll let me know. Yes... but be careful, I still need you. Don't worry Goodbye. I can already see the sheriff's face, when he finds out we know everything. Mr. Rogers. What are you doing here? Where's the sheriff? I don't know There is nobody here, not even the prisoner. I assume he's on his way to the state prison with this bandit only the deputy sheriff accompanied him... and he was shot in an ambush which Anderson's men lured him into. Did you see that? Yes... and the only one who can tell us about it is Jack Logan, but unfortunately he escaped. We are most sorry about that, because we were particularly interested in it. I thank you for risking your life to bring some peace to this nest. Before it was a quiet place but now... It's hard to believe that you can live peacefully in a place where even the sheriff is the boss of a murder gang. You, Mr. Rogers... have no idea where to find him? I don't know I have to talk to him myself, that's why I'm here. Well you amaze me. For us he was always a good sheriff, a man of honour, are you sure of what you say? Certainly. Since you came to Blackstone, I've had one surprise after another. Oh yeah... and what surprise have you had since we got here? Especially the gun. Who did it belong to? Why are you sursprised about the gun? Why do you want to know how we got it? Well, it belonged to a good friend, a man I was very fond of and whom I haven't seen in many years. When I saw his gun, I knew something had happened to him. I was hoping so much that you could have given me a hint. Maybe it's the same person who gave it to Johnny, do you think? How... You said you found her! Yes, we said that. I told you it's my son, I felt it. I'm sure now. Quite possible. But I still don't believe it. And the other is Murphy's son. What should I do now? What do they know about us both? I don't care, and I certainly don't let everything go, that I built all these years. What do you mean? I'll stop them, whatever. You frighten me, Steve. I cannot take it. Not that! You will get through it and forget it. You're wrong... I'm not backing down this time. I don't care if I lose everything, including you. My God Steve, not him, no! It's too late now. I've already sent for the Lassiters. Friends, come and listen. come closer. Along with Judge Wright, I called you to discuss the situation. First of all, we can't go for long without a sheriff, and who better of us than our friend Fred. - That's right... we've been talking about this for days. I know Bob Watson well and I'm sure that he won't just brush this story aside. More blood will be spilled. Accept, amigo, and let's hope that many pistoleros will come, even if we don't know who pays for the funerals. He is linked to the dead, now I understand why they call him "Funny‚Äù. So Fred, what are you waiting for, give us your okay, say yes... Why not, Fred... Well... I accept. Come with me. Congratulations... Thanks. By the power that my office as judge gives me, and on behalf of all citizens of this place I appoint you to be sheriff and deputy sheriff of Blackstone. Now swear before this Holy Bible that you will let the law prevail. Put your hand on the Bible and say, "I swear." I swear. Judge Wright, bravissimo. What a great memory, he used the same words as 14 years ago. Likeable. Swear! I swear. My respect. Here is the star, earn him respect. And I wish you wouldn't have to take up arms, in the performance of your duty. It's not the finale, judge, now that everything is going so well. Likeable. Gentlemen, let's toast the law enforcement officers. Well, how are you feeling? You have become an important man to her. Well yeah Elisabeth, as long as I'm important to you. You permit... Get to work! Finally we have 2 gentlemen who can be trusted. Here's to Fred and Johnny! Thank you. To my best suppliers. Sympathetic... Congratulations, "Funny"‚Äù, your hour has come now. Well, boy, but few are able to enrich themselves from the dead, at the expense of the living. I don't envy you. Johnny... now you stay with us forever. You haven't told me yet if you're happy. I'm happy and you know that. Are you staying? I always wanted that, since I first saw you in the village. It's already passed... 8 hours and not quite 2 minutes. Howdy Logan. Howdy Bob. I don't like this place, the mine isn't made for the Lassiters. Let's go to the village. Mr. Rogers told us we should wait here... told us not to be seen in the area, otherwise we spoil his plan. I'm leaving to greet him and on the way back I'll bring something to drink. I hope I'm not unlucky enough to encounter those 2 bounty hunters. Pay attention William. You can't kill him, I haven't forgotten what you were doing back then... Welcome boys, after 2 weeks of solitude, I'm starting to feel like a caveman. Tell me, Logan, how's Blackstone? The two of them are still there. 2 days ago Rogers came and told me that they had been made sheriff and deputy sheriff. An ugly deal when people support it. You don't know the Lassiters very well. If they act, they'll smash the whole village. Sheriff... I'll try not to be seen. It's me going to my friend Rogers. I'm going to make them sign, whatever. What else? Then you'll be seen in the village. If the 2 bounty hunters don't attack you, provoke them. I leave that to you. All I ask is that you get rid of them. Anything else? That's enough. What we do after that depends on the people's reaction. Whatever happens, don't show up here, lest people think you work for me. I am the one who comes to you. And you brought so many men for so little? That's none of your business. It's me who pays. This gives us an easier game. And when should we start? In the morning. Rest assured. Mark... I want out. Saddle my horse. Who would have thought a sheriff had to do a real job. Nobody gives you anything for free. It's high time you earn your living honestly. I hope they pay the new sheriff well. Look. Come on. I am back in no time, Fred. Okay... Mrs. Rogers. Please leave the town, immediately tonight. Why should I? They want to kill you, and they will if you don't go. Tomorrow may already be too late. Excuse me? Please don't ask any questions. I can't answer them. Does your husband know about it? I can't tell you more, but listen to me, go... - Fred, guess who came to talk to me? Who? Mrs. Rogers. On, right? She gave me such a weird look when she spoke to me. There was something in her eyes... Don't say she made eyes at you. Well... So what did she say? She advised me to leave the village as soon as possible, because my life, our life, is in danger. There seems to be someone here in Blackstone who wants to get rid of us. What do you say to that? Nothing... We're staying here. Whenever there is a danger there's a lot of money involved. I'm glad you think so. You know how much I like to stay here. Mrs. Rogers and her husband are interested in... What are you mumbling about... Oh nothing. I just remembered something. Never mind. wait here for me... That's all. Nothing more is known of Mrs. Reeds' son and heard her husband's Killer. And nothing about the pistol from the golden box either. After a few months the widow luckily married Mr. Rogers, and Rogers has made his ranch the largest in the area. Say, "Funny‚Äù, do you know why the bandit kidnapped his victim's son? Because he didn't ask for a ransom. But they believe it. Maybe he was scared. Much has been said about it in this area. Nothing more was heard of him... To your health! Nice story, very interesting. Goodbye my friend, Just send me some clients. Who are they? I don't know, but now you know. you wait here Are you Forrest? Yes... what do you want? My brother wants to speak to you. He will tell you. This is my home, and I don't want to talk to anyone. Forward. Who are you? The Lassiter brothers. Doesn't the name mean anything to you? What do you want from us? We just want to talk about business. Which business? Spit it out. Stop! Always the same story. I've said umpteen times I'm not selling my land. Pay him. All the money is yours. The pay is good. Stop it, my father made himself pretty clear. Go! No, let go of me. No, let go of me. Go away! Not yet. Sign whatever they want. We can't do anything else. Don't do it Papa! Do what they want! We can't do anything about it. Make up your mind Forrest, we're in a hurry. Who is the buyer, his signature is still missing. A simple precaution, he will take care of it himself. Tell whoever it is that I'm not signing. Is that your last word? Yes, the last one. Alright... You wanted this. Grab him! What are you planning to do? You'll see. We are ready. Stop, don't hang him. I sign. Dad... Look, the Lassiter brothers. Have you heard? It's the Lassiters. Sheriff, the Lassiters. There they are. Are you ready? And whether. When? AS soon as we face the bandits. Stop, turn around. listen carefully We're coming out now and giving you a chance to defend yourselves. What do you want to do, you are two against one. Step back, Johnny. No, leave him to me. I've had a score with him for years. Well, whenever you want, Gregory. Now we're even. You can go ahead. Sorry. What is it, Gregory? Are you nervous? I don't like the whole thing. He should have been back by this time. I'm worried too. Despite everything, you were very sure. They may also have stopped somewhere for a drink.. I won't be reassured until they get back. I'm missing 6 men, now I have to do everything on my own. We have enough land and money. Tell Bob and the others to stop. It's too late for all that now. It's never too late to be happy. One should live for the other, we have no reason to be so merciless. Forget this business, Steve. It's not me who has to forget it. This boy won't stop until he avenges his father and appropriated everything that is ours. Maybe you are wrong. He may not even be my son, you always said no. Exactly. Where are you going? To find out it's not him. And if he is, I'll kill him, I swear to you. Howdy George. A turbulent day to read the newspaper. There's some interesting stuff in here. For example: The assignment to the South Company and the building of a railroad to traverse these lands. And the weird thing is that I have never heard of this project. Neither did I. The newspapers are published extremely rarely in this area for some time. Sit down. I just want to ask you one question: Has no one been interested in registering some lands lately? Mmm, just the new sheriff. The new sheriff, mhm. Is something wrong? What's the matter, Rogers? These men killed the Lassiters and all the others. I don't know how they did it. What are we waiting for, Let's kill the two and let's wipe the slate clean forever. We'll get rid of them, but without haste. For now, keep calm. So, Bob... I'm almost certain that one of them is Alan Reed's son. Impossible. After such a long time. And I'm telling you, he is. What are you planning to do now? I have a plan and you will execute it. Listen carefully. Elizabeth! What's that. One day you promised me not to touch a gun again. I stuck to that, too. Today is the day I will defend my belongings. Nobody wants to drive you off your land. And if someone does, you have reason to defend yourself. But in the meantime... don't worry. It is my thing. Remember, it's my son. What are you up to? What I should have done on day one. Get rid of him once and for all. I don't allow that. I warned you, Steve. I swear to you I won't allow that. Fred. Fred! Howdy. Howdy Fred. I need your help. I must find them, immediately. Find who? The killers of the Forrests. That's where I come from. They killed them all. I won't find peace before I find these killers. I wanted to bury her. I owe you that, I must avenge her. I am so sorry, Johnny... I know what this girl meant to you. You can't understand that. It wasn't just a passion. She was a part of me. I have known life... and now death. Who do you think it was? I don't know. But I'll find out. I swore that to her and I will kill them. Calm down Johnny. DO you know where the road leads to? What are your plans? Oh, nothing. It's just an old trick. Don't shoot. Don't shoot, don't shoot, it's me... It's the sheriff. Damn it... Away from here. Sam, keep shooting, we'll put our guns on them. I don't understand what all this is about. And you... Yes I do. Now I understand everything. Can you tell me why you are laughing? Boy, we managed to turn into two lawmen. Glad to hear that. Since you know everything, tell me... why this woman shot at her husband. That's a long story. It has to do with the gun. We found her and brought her here. And with that gun she finally did justice. This is destiny. She did it for you, Johnny. She's convinced that you're her son. That I'm her son? I'll talk to her. I can not believe that. If she believes that, why would you disappoint her? She shot her accomplice to save you. She did a good deed. A wonderful deed. Life goes on, like in Wyoming? No, in the cemetery. Right... as in Colorado. As in Colorado.
