[UPBEAT MUSIC] [AIR WHOOSHING] [UPBEAT MUSIC] [STEVE] Scripture says, "In all your ways, acknowledge Him and He'll direct your path." [UPBEAT MUSIC] Well, a path is not a freeway or a road or a boulevard. A path could be cutting through anything where nobody's never been before. [UPBEAT MUSIC] My career is the same thing. [UPBEAT MUSIC] Doting out of art business was very tough. The term starving artists, is very real. [UPBEAT MUSIC] I get a lot of sports art, a lot of University of Alabama. Then African-American artists doing artwork that was sanctioned by the university. Nobody had ever done it before. During a time of my childhood, when the civil rights moment was on, teacher would ask me, what do you wanna be when you grow up? You never said artists. She will tell you, you got to think of something else. The thing that's big to me is non-visual. The spirit of God that comes in to the studio and enables me to do everything that I do. That's the most important part of it. 30 years doing sports art, artwork in almost every sports hall of fame in the country. Everybody's calling, are you gonna do this painting? We wanna print on it. All of a sudden, God speaks to me and said, "We're not gonna go that way." If God says something, I've learnt you better just go and do what He says. [SOFT BEAT MUSIC] A mutual friend called me up one day and said, you've got to meet this guy, he's got a great story. I get that all the time. In this case, it was true. Over barbecue lunch, I heard about Steve, I heard about his transformation. I knew that I had to be involved in helping tell that story. And I thank the Lord every day, I got that opportunity. He's gifted from God. He is an untrained artist who looks like he went to the Parsons or The Grand Central Academy. I've never quite seen anybody paint like that untrained, ever. Steve Skipper is an incredible artist. I mean, breathtaking art, you know, God-given talent, amazing ability. There's a lot of sports art out in the marketplace. And I do think sports art is very important because sporting events and memories from sporting events are very visual in nature. Those iconic moments in time that are captured, create those lasting memories for people. This is still one of my favorite, if not my most favorite pieces of sports art. The entire concept just exploded off the campus. I didn't know who he was when he sent this but he got my attention when he sent this. Steve Skipper, man, I didn't know much about Steve not at all, I mean getting to really know him, he did a poetry of me on the sideline, and he should know how to capture the moment and the individual, his work is unmatched. The thing about Steve is when you can match talent with passion and professionalism, then you go come up with a good product. And he comes up with a good product every time. I met Steve over 25 years ago when I've had a number of pieces art of Steve's and I'm a fan of his. Oh, this is Nick Saban, won the national championship. He had a very tough life when he was younger and he pulled himself out of it and begins to paint such extraordinary works. I don't know how he did it. You can't explain that. Explain that, explain that. I don't know how he did it, explain that. [VIDEO REWINDING SOUNDS] [SOFT BEAT MUSIC] I was born in a place called Rosedale, which is a part of Homewood. A very, very special place where they say it takes a village to raise a child. I think they kind of invented that in Rosedale. Steve grew up at a small community near Birmingham, Alabama located right in the middle of a very affluent area in the city. Very, very protective parents and everybody hovering over you because of the civil rights movement going on at the time. I didn't understand too much about it. I think that with everything that was going on, they did an incredible job of taking care of us mentally and emotionally and not allowing us to get involved in what was going on, which was danger all around. [PEOPLE SCREAMING] I remember vividly one day I was probably about five came on the little black and white TV that Dr. King had been killed. [PEOPLE SHOUTING] I have some very sad news for all of you. And that is that, Martin Luther King was shot and was killed tonight [INDISTINCT]. [PEOPLE SCREAMING] I remember the screaming, not only in the house in the whole neighborhood, everything changed. Negroes of the United States have demonstrated that non-violence is not sterile passivity, but a powerful moral force, which makes false social trends formation. Sooner or later, all the peoples of the world will have to discover a way to live together in peace and thereby transform this pending cosmic elegy into a creative Psalm of brotherhood. [PEOPLE SCREAMING] Birmingham has such a special place for the country when it comes to civil rights agitation, insistence of people, it's the site of some of the most horrific events that showed us who we were. The civil rights movement was not just about marching here and marching there, it was about getting opportunities, better opportunities than we had. At Rosedale, I would have a book that would be about this size, but you go to Edgewood elementary that same book was like this and it had a whole lot more information in it. Steve was in the fourth grade at Rosedale School, which was still a totally segregated all black elementary school. A teacher named BurnHill Saunders happened to past his desk one day and noticed Steve drawing. She was extremely passionate. She recognized the fact that I had something special. She took him down a hallway to a tiny little closet, in that closet were art supplies. She sat Steve down and said, "I'll come back and get you later." She went to the principal of the school and told him, and wanted to get some funds allocated for some art supplies, but there were no funds in the school so she started paying her own money. Looking back on it right now, I know she was trying to get me to concentrate, focus. And she brought these old paints and these beautiful brushes. And she actually bought canvas and stuff like that. I didn't know anything, but we can know a piece of paper or something like that on a notebook. It would make the story beautiful if I tell you, I sat in there and did some beautiful artwork, but the truth of the matter is, I sat there and I was so intimidated. Squeezing paint out of a tube was a new experience, all these different paintbrushes. Why did you have to have 10 different paint brushes? And then at the same time, I mean, all these different... All paints and stuff like that. All he knew was they smell good. He still enjoys the smell of that oil paint. It wasn't a good experience for a long time, but I think that she kept believing that something was gonna happen. She would come to my home and talked to my parents and say, "One day your son is gonna be real special in art." Well, he didn't put anything on the canvas that day, but Ms. Saunders came back and promised he could come back anytime he wanted to and that's where he really started putting oil paint on the canvas. I had a big brother, Don, everything he wanted to do, I wanted to do. And that got me in trouble sometimes. You know, he tends to do some things that weren't right. But one thing that he did, he used to like to draw, he could do the head of a man in about five minutes, I thought that was so cool. And I had an uncle that was very good. And he could look at you doing whatever you're doing, take a pencil and a piece of paper and make some beautiful sketch. And I will be so excited, you know, because he was beyond my brother. He could really get detailed and everything. It was funny though that after he would get through, he would be so sad. He couldn't be an artist. They couldn't be allowed to be one, but he was just totally emotionally destroyed, which caused him to become an alcoholic. Steve's uncle left Birmingham to go back to California, where he had previously worked as a sketch artist, just outside the Gates of Disneyland. He was convinced a black man could never make a living in the segregated South. As a little kid you know you see things, but you don't really understand and later on you do, because when I told my mom, I wanna be an artist, she started thinking about his experience. I'm gonna have to go through the same stuff he went through and she didn't want that for me. Steve's mother told him, no black man can make a living as an artist. For a long time I thought she was rejecting my artwork. I didn't really understand where she was coming from. Everything that she was trying to protect me from in my passion, my dedication to go ahead and be an artist, I experienced every bit of that anyway. And she would always tell me just get a real job, you know, just make a living. It's not that important to make a difference, just to make a living. Get an education, get a real job, don't do anything that upset anybody. At nine years old, I witnessed some stuff that I never should have saw as a kid. I thought the sun rose and set with my parents, at nine years old, my mom had an affair and I walked in on her with this other guy. And it really just messed me up in a whole lot of ways. It filled me with a whole lot of anger. And when I say anger, I mean way past what a nine year old kid should ever go through. I didn't have any kind of outlet of getting it out. Couldn't tell anybody too embarrassed. So I just held it on the inside. I saw the relationship between her and my dad kind of deteriorating. And even though it deteriorated, they stayed together physically. He would have his life and she would have hers. A few years after that, we were bust in 1968. I was a part of the school system of kids transferring from African-American neighborhoods into white schools, which traumatic for me because the only white people that I saw was the insurance mayor and we didn't have a relationship. So we're going to schools and the turmoil of going into that different world and then the turmoil of them, receiving us into their world. It was really traumatic on both sides. And so once we get there, there's a whole lot of different racial clashing between students, we get in fights every day. My situation stood out a little bit more than everybody else, because I was extremely angry. I think I got into more fights than anybody else. By the time I was 13, this anger was like a fever pitch. From nine to 13, all that anger was inside of me. One Sunday afternoon, I had a cousin that introduced me to marijuana and on the back porch of my parents' home, I smoked my first joint. It seemed like every ounce of anger and every part of the problems that I was facing, that was the answer to it. Because I didn't feel any other pain. I didn't feel any time. I think it was a few months after that I was introduced to The Crips. Steve really didn't feel like he had a strong family life at this time. He turned to some other source for family. [ANNOUNCER] Two additional Crips gang members were arrested in South Central Los Angeles this morning. [WOMAN] The drugs seized at the border yesterday are believed to belong to the Crips, a street gang rising in national notoriety. The Crips are one of the largest and most violent street gangs in the world. They're primarily made up of young African-Americans and Hispanics and they originated in Southern California. First as black clubs and then to something a lot more sinister. Membership thrived among those that were most affected by joblessness poverty, racial segregation, after infighting and some vicious battles with other gangs, The Crips came under the influence of the major drug cartels and they spread their influence even more to other cities across the US including Birmingham. And so that night that I went in real late at night, very, very dark, you're gonna feel these all these guys are there. And then there's a leader that walks up to you and asks if you really wanna be a part of what we entail. I just stand there and look him in the eye and say, yeah. He speaks to this other guy and said, "Okay, we're gonna jump him on tonight." And so there's 10 other guys that walk up all of a sudden, they're all bigger than me, probably anywhere from 17 to 20, maybe some are 30 years old. There are people in the Crips who were in the military. They train these guys how to fight hand to hand combat. Navy Seals, they can train you how to kill with your bear hands. So the 10 other guys walk up in front of me. Then the leader all of a sudden he says, go. And all 10 of them started beating on me. This draws out this anger that's on the inside of me and I look at every last one of them. Every last one of them looks like my mom. So after a few minutes of fighting, I remember having blood all over me. I remember all those guys being on the ground. I remember blood in my mouth and everything and I remember pieces of skin and everything all over my face. And I remember looking at the leader and asking him what he next. And he said, the answer much worse, "You're in." So from that point on life just changed totally, totally different. You're not a normal kid anymore. You're from a serious serious organization that you ended run by drug kingpins from California. You're not just hanging out on the corner with your pants hanging low or something like that. This is a totally different situation that you've been recruited into. So he found exactly what he was looking for. He found brothers, he found family, he found a structure. It just happened that certain way was about as bad as it can get. I used to walk up the street from my parents' house, turn the corner where my mom couldn't see, there's a limousine that picked me up took me to school. I get in the limousine change clothes from clothes that was sent from California for me to wear in schools. There's a backpack full of drugs, I put a backpack on my back and go in school, sell drugs all day. School teachers, students, whoever, come back backpack full of money, turn it back over to them, cycle. But I'm thinking limousine, new clothes, new shoes and everything. This was heaven. Steve also became their chief drug debt enforcer. He's the guy who went out and collected drug money. I've gotten good at it. I've actually gotten good at being a crook. I'm so good at it. I've never went out to collect the drug dealers money and came back without it. You know what it takes to get this money. Even at 16 and 13, we're dealing with grown people that own money who cares. And when it comes to getting the money back for the drug dealer, I have been the best there is. High school was a totally different situation from here on. High school wasn't high school anymore, high school was business. Because of what I focused on was not lesson, I didn't care anything about lesson, because I always thought getting your lesson, you graduate, you want a good job, I had a good job. I was making more money than the teachers. So high school was business and it was about selling as many drugs as I could, to as many people as I could. And I had teachers and I had people that worked in the school and I had a lot of students. And about me being in Homewood High School system, money was not the problem. This is not like working in a ghetto, this is a school where money is flowing everywhere. And if these kids wanted, they gonna get mama and daddy to give them the money to get it and so we were in heaven, so I thought. When I started playing football, that's when I started getting high. Well I took pride in the fact that there was a group of guys that we played football together. We won a State championship my sophomore year. We played one game we didn't get high and we almost got beat, we won that game by three points. We were high as a kite and we beat everybody just sell it because you couldn't feel any pain. [LAUGHS] Throwing our bodies everywhere. I don't know how we concentrated or remember what a play was or something like that but we did. Steve was about at the lowest point you could imagine any human being getting to. [SOFT BEAT MUSIC] Nothing in the world satisfies. It always pacifies, but it never satisfies. Looking back at it, I can't believe you know that God brought me through something like that because I remember how many times over and over again, you come this close to being dead. But at 16 years old, I had begin to become tired, which was a blessing. We were doing campus ministry in Jacksonville State University and one of the members there was a member of Steve's church in Birmingham. And that's the brother that is called Big Mike, that knows Steve. At that time, I knew nothing about Steve, but I knew Mike very well. And he said, "Let's have a meeting over at my church." I'm sitting in a park one day, we had just got through robbing this place. That everybody in neighborhood knows God, but can name a big Mike, real big guy. We wasn't friends at that time but I knew him. Mike had become what he kept calling, saved, and he would witness to everybody and tell them about that he had come in contact with Jesus Christ. And he yells out, Steve Skipper, you need to put that stuff down and give your life to Jesus Christ. We're not just in the park as little kids, we were the most dangerous people in the world, are sitting right here. And if anybody approaches that space, anytime like that, or with the wrong look, it could be dangerous. And so all these guys are packing. I know that his life was in jeopardy and he starts talking about Jesus Christ at the top of his lungs. And I'm supposed to be the leader that's sitting there. You know, I'm supposed to be, you know, if all these other are German shippers I'm the Rockwell, but at the same time, what they don't know is everything that he's saying about Jesus Christ on the inside, that little boy that's on the inside of me, I'm listening to everything he's saying because it's for me and I'm tired. And I said, leave him alone just let him talk. He's not hurting anybody just let him talk. And that's totally against our cree to let them talk. I tell Mike, I said, come here, let me talk to you. And so they think that I'm fixing to tell him, look, I'll kill you if you don't shut up. I go over and I talk to Mike and they can't really hear what I'm saying. And I said, "Look, you don't need to talk to me like this. "Maybe we can go somewhere sometime "I could meet you somewhere keep talking, "but not right now." And he is so bold. That's one thing that Jesus gives you, is the boldness. When you first get saved, bro, you got a boldness on the inside. You could care less what the devil has to say. And so Mike says, "Look, I've been praying for you "and God wants you to be saved. "He's going to save you." I didn't know nobody was praying for me. He's got a great plan for your life and it's better than what you're doing right now. I can see this far and he was talking about what God wanted to do with me. And so it was sounding good to me, but I knew this guy was over there looking. And I knew at the same time, you know, man, you got to go somewhere else because this is gonna get bad and it's gonna get bad quick in a few minutes. They not scared of the police, they pay the police. They're not afraid, there's nothing, you know? And so he keeps talking and I say, I'll tell you what, I'll make you a deal. I go to church with you one night if you agree, don't talk to me about Jesus no more. He said deal. He said it too quick it almost scared me. I mean, I thought he's gonna think about it at least. He said, I'll tell you what, "I'm gonna get a preacher to come to that church "right over there "and he's gonna preach a sermon just for you." That night before I went in there, I made a deal with the guy 'cause I thought that this was, you know I go in here, I've been to church before they started singing, they start getting excited and everything. In about 15 minutes they get so excited they won't notice I'm going out of the door and I would meet this guy outside then I would start taking speed that night. Well, I walked into the church and sat down in the back. The choir was singing. And when brother Mincey got up and he started preaching, I had never heard anybody preach like this. Only thing I'm used to is pastors, pastors preached on Sunday. But there's another thing that God had that I didn't know anything about called an evangelist he preached everywhere, anytime. So this guy comes in when he first started preaching and he starts talking about stuff that only I knew. And then I wonder, did I tell Mike about this? Could Mike have told this guy about this and I started getting angry because this was too personal. And then he started talking about stuff that I know I didn't tell Michael about. And it was like, there's a lot of people in the church, but he was talking directly to me. There was a young man standing to this side that caught my eye. And what made me remember him after the alter call the next Sunday. And I pull up a little late and what he was doing, he was fussing about something. They said he wanted to know why church had not started yet. He said church was supposed to have started at 11 o'clock. It is 10 minutes after 11. And this is the same man that I saw in that corner of the alter call standing there. I had no idea that God cared about my everyday aspect of my life. That he cared about what I was going through as a teenager. You know, I thought that religion was for old people. The same God that was concerned about Joseph as a young teenager or Samson as a young man, was concerned about me. Everything that happened in my childhood, that he was not only concerned about it and he was not only able to do something about it, but he's willing. And all I had to do with surrender my life to Him, for sure. This was a no brainer. [SOFT BEAT MUSIC] December 23rd, 1976, 9:46 PM, life was good. I found myself on that altar giving my life to Jesus Christ. That 7:15 rendezvous never happened because Steve did not leave the church. I found out later the speed that he had it would have cut right at me and would've killed me. So God saved my life and my soul that night. And when a person can know what God has done for them like that, that put a different kind of dedication in that person. When I gave my life to the Lord, I was so happy. One of the additional things that brother Mincey talked about was God had given us all gifts and talents. And so my mind ran back to the fact that I knew how to draw, but I had sealed that you know, because you're in the gangs you don't have time to be drawing anything. And then he said, it's never too late for you to pick up what God gave you, what you put down. There's no way that Mike could have told him this. [UPBEAT MUSIC] And then I started thinking and start remembering, there's two different things I got to deal with. Saturday morning, I made up my mind to go talk to these guys and let them know I won't be back. There's a Cree in the group that the only way to get out, it's to die. Boldness came over me that I had never had before in my life went up a gang like this right here, boldness is your best friend. And I wanna make it clear to everybody in Alabama and California I won't be back anymore. This is it, I resigned. I'm retiring, I'm quitting. You can keep the gold watch, I'm gone. Don't never sell short the boldness that comes with being a Christian. So when I walked in, I had a boldness that actually scared them. They never seen anything like that. Nobody never stood up to them, you don't stand up to them. And they backed up in a way to where I turned around and I walked out, I've been walking ever since nobody said a word. [SOFT BEAT MUSIC] I've been addicted to some drugs that have been taking And I said," I got to go home "and I got to go through that." And so I went home and I sat up in the bed waiting. I was afraid 'cause I know that it was like a train wreck. All of a sudden it will come from anywhere and it would take you over. And so I sat there in the bed, you know, one hour, two hours, three hours, four hours. Next thing you know, that was Friday night. And next thing you know, it's Saturday morning. It never happened. 42 years later, it never happened. [UPBEAT MUSIC] My junior year in high school, I got saved. I was witnessing to everybody and I was witnessing to the janitors. I was on everybody's nerves. And instead of reading the books, I read my Bible, all the time reading the Bible. Only thing I want to know is about God. My senior year, we were at practice, pouring down rain. We were hitting each other. We had full pads and everything and the mud all over the place. I looked over towards the high school and there was a light on, in one of the rooms. And I knew exactly which room that was, that was art class. And I saw people walking around in clean clothes, in no rain and no football gear, no cuts on your hands or nothing like that, no pain. And I thought, you know what? I know how to do something else. [LAUGHS] And that's when God started really telling me, that He wanted me to be an artist. Nobody in my family at that time had had a scholarship or a chance to go to college. My mom and dad's hopes and dreams were hanging on me. I was at one of the best high schools in the State, pretty average, you know, which I struggled to keep, but I was pretty good in football. I knew how to draw and paint. So the counselors came and they said, we got good news for you, you got three scholarship options. You got two scholarships in football and you got one scholarship to Florida State, Fine Art. And I celebrate it for about five seconds because in second number six, the Lord spoke in my ear and said, "You don't need to take either one of them." And I'd get this funny look on my face. And the counselors looking at me like what, you know, this is good news. And the Lord spoke again and said, "I'm gonna teach you everything "you need to know about art myself. "So in the end, I'll be the only one "that you will have to give the glory to." So I told the counselor, I'm not gonna need the scholarships, God's gonna teach me everything I need to know. And she looked at me like I lost my mind. She said, "How do you think this is gonna go over "with your parents?" This is gonna be world war III. I went home and told my parents, they went ballistic. They thought I'd lost my mind. After the civil rights movement, we did all the marching and everything. We got the opportunities and he comes up here and saying, Jesus is gonna teach me everything I needed to know? But even after he had turned his life around, after he left the Crips, after he had rejected drugs and after he graduated high school, Steve's path was not necessarily an easy one. Neither was his dream of becoming an artist. He soon had a family to feed. Though he continued to work at his art, Steve followed his mother's advice. He took a job in one of the mills there in Birmingham, American Cast Iron Pipe Company that made steel pipe. He had probably one of the dirtiest jobs you can imagine. [SOFT JAZZ MUSIC] Married with a son at the time and I'm pretty happy, it's one of the best jobs there is as far as benefits are concerned. But what people wouldn't tell me about the other part, the first time that I went to work there, there's fire all over the place. These huge labels of melted iron that has been transported all over the planet. There's dirt everywhere, there's filth everywhere. There's little metal fragments on everything and all this kind of stuff. Before you go home, you have to take a shower to get in your car. I think it's pretty much any of our idea of hell. That's where Steve works. One night the job that I'm working is kind of away from all of the danger I'm thinking. They tell you always pay attention to what you're doing and always stay focused on what we told you to do. 'Cause you see people getting hurt, see people get killed all the time. After I get through working, I used to go home and work on a painting I'm working on. Steve had actually started painting a portrait of Samson, someone who had broken his vow to God and had lost his talents, his strength. And that's very apropos to what's about to happen. Yeah, I was in this place where there's a whole lot of pipe that's on this railing and you rolling the pipe down the rail as they go towards the furnace. And so all of a sudden, I take my mind off of what I'm doing and I'm looking over here, but the pipe was still rolling and I don't know it. So my thumb gets caught between these two. When that pipe hit my thumb, I heard the devil this time. I heard him tell me, I've got you this time. You're never playing again. I turned around and I looked at my hand and all of this was crushed and it was filled with looks like hundreds of pieces of the little metal fragments. And then it looks so bad, I can't even look at it. And so my boss came over and I had one of the toughest boss and he said, "What happened? "What did you do?" And I showed him my hand and he screamed, you know he's in despair. By the time we get to Brookwood Hospital it's really hurting, it's hurting bad. The specialist comes in and he looks at it he said we got to get it cleaned up before I can do anything with it. He puts it in some kind of solution and all the dirt in the metal fragments start to come off. And it's about like, stuff like that thin that was in my hand. Wrap it up, I go home and I started thinking about the painting is half finished. You'll never paint again, you forget it. [SOFT BEAT MUSIC] My hands wrapped up like this and I'm sitting in my bed and all of a sudden, God tells me, "Get up, let's go to the ease room." Can't you see what's wrong? Can't you see what's happening? I go to the ease room. He said, "Get the paint brush." My hand is wrapped with gauze. When you're artists, you gotta feel that paintbrush. You gotta be able to feel it and maneuver it around. And I put the paintbrush down in between the gauze of my thumb and my hand and it slips out of my hand. And I'm trying to figure out, why is God telling me to do this? This doesn't make any sense. And I tell him I cannot do it. And he said, "Pick up the paintbrush and put it back in there again." He said, "Put your hand up against the canvas "and we're fixing to start painting." He's saying, we, this time I put my hand up there and just in obedience, I'm crying, 'cause I'm thinking, why is He doing that? It's over and all of a sudden I feel something on top of my hand. My hand starts to move and I'm crying so bad, but I can see what I'm painting. And the next thing, you know, I wipe my face and every color is going exactly where it's supposed to go. And it's going better than it was when my hand was right. He actually finished that painting of Samson, his hand recovered completely. He's able to use it obviously very much well. [UPBEAT MUSIC] From that moment til now, when I get in the studio, I can feel His hand on top of mine and He's got my hand across the canvas. And it takes me probably a month after I finish a painting even today to sign because I know who did it. [UPBEAT MUSIC] Steve got started at sports art almost by accident. The first paying job that Steve talks about was at one of the primarily white high schools in the Birmingham area. They asked him to come in and draw sketches of the baseball team. Steve would go in and do the sketches and charge $35 a piece for those, that's more money than he would make making cast iron pipe at the simco. He thought, you know what? There may be money in this after all. And that time in Birmingham... With a local sportscaster Herb Winches, one of the players offered Steve money to paint a portrait of him. Steve didn't know how much to charge him for it. He was gonna ask for 35 or $40. Herb Winches said, Steve, you don't charge enough. These guys make a lot of money, charge them. Steve agreed to charge $250. And that's where he learned the value of what he was doing. One thing I understood about athletes and coaches, they all have egos and their egos are like Mount Rushmore. When one of them gets something and the other one finds out he's got it, he wants something not like it, but bigger. So that was cool, that was real good because when Cornelius Bennett wanted something Derek Thomas was gonna want something bigger. So it was more money. Derek Thomas had just signed with the Kansas City Chiefs and he came over to my house and he wants to commission me to do a painting and he pays me $10,000. I remember taking that check. My mom was sick and I took that check to her. And I showed her the check and she set up in the bed like this was penicillin or something. She sat up in the bed and she said, "You got a real job." I think that was one of the best times of my life, because it's about two weeks later, Bobby Humper writes me a check for $12,000. [SOFT BEAT MUSIC] This is gonna be kind of strange to somebody that's not a Christian, but when you have a relationship with God, He'll tell you to do stuff that doesn't make sense at all. As Steve was beginning to paint portraits of a professional athletes, including members of the Atlanta Falcons, he met Mike Schula. Mike Schula at that time was the quarterback for the University of Alabama. And Mike saw some of the work that Steve had done for the Falcons. He suggested that Steve talk to the University of Alabama head football coach at the time, Ray Perkins. Perkins had a bad reputation. He was about as tough as a $2 State and he just really didn't take any guff. I had just gotten saved. God had just got me out of the Crips and with the attitude that I had in the Crips and the attitude that he has, you know, this is gonna be a train wreck. So in my mind, that's what I'm thinking. I remember one night, God telling me just as clear as I'm talking to you right now, I want you to go to Tuscaloosa and meet with coach Perkins. Don't have a college degree, barely got out of high school and you want me to go to a university to talk to King Kong. I had to be just either, truly in love with God or crazy, or a little bit of both, because I went down there. Turned out to be a good thing that he did after giving Steve a rough time, Ray told him about the annual senior banquet for the Alabama football team. Coach Perkins wanted a painted portraits of each one of those players and have had a part of the trophy. He said, "I've got a guy that's doing it already, "but he's not as good as you. "How'd you like the job?" He said, "I'm gonna fire that guy in about five minutes "and I'm gonna give you the job." And I'm like, yes. I mean, are you kidding? Yes. He said, I got 22 singers. I need the portraits done in two weeks, can you do it? I said, yes. [LAUGHS] And I get in the car and I'm driving back up the road and I started thinking, 22 singers in two weeks, are you crazy? There's no way I can do that. God gave me a different technique of doing pastel portraits. I could do four in a day. And so ahead of time, I was finished with the portraits that really get him charged up. That began a long relationship with the University of Alabama football team from Ray Perkins, through Jean Stallings, through Mike Schula himself who became the coach later on at Alabama, up until the current coach, Nick Saban. When going to the University of Alabama and you can confirm it by people who don't want you there. People who definitely don't want you there as a fine artist. You have the nerve to come in here. The race you are, without a college education and think that you can actually compete with guys who are here and who are so-called the right color and who have college education here? The brunt of the racism was terrible. I experienced people who were determined with everything in them to make sure that I didn't make it in the business. We got to the point where, I mean, I'm pretty much ready to quit. In fact, there's a lot of frame shops and different galleries I'm not allowing them right now. [PHONE BEEPS] One night I was sitting there with my kids and the phone rang. We had this den where we sit in and you can look out the window you could see people come into the driveway. And so the phone rang and there was this eerie voice of somebody on there saying this morning for me not to come back to Tuscaloosa. And so we look out the window and it's dark. And then there's cars in the driveway. They say it on the tape. You see how easy it is for us to get to you. And that's when my girls and my boys and all of them who knew how to draw, wanted to be artists, but when they heard that message, they wanted to do something else. At the same time, there were some people who were just as determined that they were gonna do everything they could to make sure that they were gonna help me. And I have people to come to me and said, "I don't know why I'm while I'm doing this, "but I just feel like I need to help you. "I feel like I need to be on your side "and I'm gonna make sure you get everything that you need." [UPBEAT MUSIC] We met Steve at a charity benefit. They auctioned a painting that he had of the Alabama LSU game. It signified the tornado that happened in Alabama in 2011, we ended up winning it. It was a tornado behind it, right? Yeah, there's a tornado in there. I heard about Steve through I think, Ricky Davis, who was a teammate of mine in Alabama. They talked about, you know, doing a portrait and I'm not a guy that likes to do portraits or anything. And I was kind of lukewarm about doing it. But I found out about how passionate he was, but also how talented he was. And he came up with this photograph and he used it and it came out very, very well. We ran into Steve Skipper through a friend of ours, was introduced, just felt his passion and saw a little bit of his work, strong in his faith as was David, just felt comfortable with Steve before he left and thought, you know, this is the guy that we'd really like to see do this piece. The day he brings it in the office, open it up and look at it. You just kind of speechless. The first thing David did prior to putting on the helmet and getting ready was bow his head, fold his hands and say a little prayer. And I reached out to Steve because he's just sent this to me and to break through all the clutter of things that you're constantly receiving across your desk, I'm like, wow, man, we need you to do some additional work together. So that began our business relationship with him. Very aggressive in pursuing his goals in a very understated way. You know, when he first came and we met, you know, here's a guy that wanna be our artist. You don't think he can draw people or paint people. When you see the picture, you see more than the individual in that picture, you kind of see where they come from and you can feel what he's accomplished in life. How detailed and in depth, Steve paints them. Jenny Steve wore blue eyes, got blue eyes. The pieces of grass coming up from the field when somebody, like from the cleat marks, you know, it's unbelievable just the detail. It is beautiful, it's just gorgeous. We're running out of room for wall space. Like we don't have anywhere else to put them. So you gotta slow down. When I got the opportunity with coach Saban, that was an experience. There were a lot of people that were very opposed at me having the guts or the goal to even talk to him, to actually have my company partner with him in a contract that was unheard of. When it all came down to, I went to Memphis, Tennessee to meet with his people. And we have a folder with recommendations from all these different people, including Ozzie Newsome and Leeward Joe, and then some other people. I remember my attorneys slide in the paperwork over to the representative of coach Saban and sliding it back over and saying, "You're not gonna need that." And then he told me about this guy that I was competing against. And he said, he offered coach Saban $200,000 up front. I remember my attorney saying, you mean you brought him all the way off here to tell him that you're gonna give this opportunity to another guy. And he said, "I didn't say that. "I brought you all all the way up to here to tell you "that coach Saban wants to take Steve. "Coach Saban is sending a message back to this other guy "that he's gonna pick Steve "and the people that he's got working with him, "but they wanna have anything to do with "the University of Alabama, "that they're gonna have to help Steve make it successful." At that point, I'm actually past blown away. Coach Saban understood fully, and he put his foot down and said, "I'm taking him anyway." I cried for probably a week after that and realizing what kind of guy he really was. It's about content of character, has nothing to do with color and skin. It's about content of character. My career is the same thing. There's a lot of people that were far from African-American that made sure that they were gonna do everything possible for me to make it. And they were willing to take the flack from their own people. And when I did my research for the civil rights movement, I found that the civil rights movement wouldn't have lasted at all, it would have crumble except for the inclusion of all the other different races that made it possible and made it successful. Alabama had just won the national championship. Everybody is calling me, asking me, you know, are you're gonna do this painting? We wanna print on it and stuff like that. And I'm super happy. All of a sudden, God speaks to me and said, we're not gonna go that way. And let's say it's sad. I'm an artist you know, bill collectors artists, we don't have a good relationship at all. He said, we're gonna just start doing civil rights artwork. I've researched this. The market on civil rights artwork is terrible. A lot of times artists just do the stuff together and not spending that much time on it just doesn't make any sense. I was in my studio and the Lord spoke to me He said, Steve Skipper for posterity. So I call Steve, the Lord say you supposed to do some kind of artwork that has something to do with posterity. God is gonna really have to be in this because a lot of people are not buying civil rights artwork, but I know he's telling me to do it. I've learned I've been saved long enough, you better just go on and do what he said. A few months later, the Birmingham city council asked him to do the civil rights artwork for the 50 year anniversary of the civil rights movement. And so I started doing research and it was not something that was out there, it was something personal. I didn't realize that civil rights movement, the heat of it was during that time of my childhood. Mayor Bale commissioned me to commemorate the civil rights movement in Birmingham. God showed me the vision of how He want the painting to look. Some people of all these different races would stand on the porch of 16th street, Baptist church. And so in the sky across where they were looking out of the sky, you saw different scenes from the civil rights movement. Because what I wanted to show it was all the people that never were in front of the cameras that made it possible for the movement to be a success. And I wanted to really put an emphasis on the fact and thank the people of all these other races that not only participated in the movement, but not only made it successful, but paid the ultimate sacrifice. So I could go in the doors of University of Alabama, NASCAR PGA, the whole lesson. When I first did the Birmingham commemorative, we've got a lot of attention, met a lot of different people. And I started to hear about Bloody Sunday in Selma. And I was actually embarrassed that after all the years that I had lived, I had never been to Selma and I had never seen [INDISTINCT]. And I knew very little about Bloody Sunday. [ANNOUNCER] Selma is praying overnight from an obscure Southern town, to the front pages of old newspapers. This church was headquarters in the Negro drive for the right to vote. And it was here that Martin Luther King came to lend his support to the campaign. Bloody Sunday in Selma, Alabama, it was a key point in the struggle for voting rights for African-Americans. Dr. Martin Luther King was leading a match from Selma across the Edmund Pettus bridge to Montgomery, all in support of the voting rights act that was then pending before Congress. Those marchers were attacked brutally by State troopers and they were ultimately turned back across the bridge. [PEOPLE SCREAMING] [SOFT BEAT MUSIC] They were getting ready to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday and when you're driving to Selma, when you come into that downtown area, and you look down the street, the bridge is sitting right there, and it seems like instead of you getting close to it, it starts to come closer to you. And it was inspiring to see it, but then to know the story behind it and what happened on it. It was mind blowing. I talked to the mayor of Selma and told them about what I did, and he had saw the Birmingham commemorative. So he invited me to come down and meet with him. He's interested in allowing me to do the commemorative, painting of Selma. [SOFT BEAT MUSIC] A lot people had gotten involved, it suggested to me, you need to take this painting and show it to ambassador Andrew Young in Atlanta. I think the thing about Steve Skipper is that he gets the spirituality of the movement. He's not painting a realistic, seeing the bridge was realistic, but in the clouds is where his work comes in. It emphasizes what I have said and that people refuse to realize we did not know what we were doing, we had no plans. We just knew that something needed to be done. And there was like an old folk say, if you take one step, God will take two. And so the way Steve paints it in the clouds emphasizes the spirituality of the whole movement. And particularly of Martin Luther King. Congressman John Lewis, who is representative out of the state of Georgia he says the first limited edition print needs to be in the presidential library of president Lyndon Johnson. He's the one that signed the voting rights act was the payoff for the Bloody Sunday. [CROWD APPLAUDING] It just so happens that the daughter of president Johnson is in town. So she request to see the painting at a private showing for her. She sees the thing and she comes up to me and whispers in my ear, "I want the first print "to be my father's presidential library, I'll set it up." It's there right now. I'd say, it's not a lot of work. You don't see a lot of civil rights work. You know, for some reason, that's some forgotten art in America. And for Steve to wanna take on that project, I think is one of the greatest thing. Because if there's anybody who can capture the civil rights, being from Alabama, living in Birmingham and seeing some of the things that had happened over the years in Birmingham and Alabama, if anybody could do it and do it from their heart and from a spiritual standpoint, I think it's Steve. I was in Louisiana with a friend, Bob Baumhower. I did a painting of Eddie Robinson, the night that he broke Cause Brian's record. Four or five hours one way then four or five hours the other way you get to know a lot about people. When I started seeing his civil rights art, I shared some stories with him about Bimini. Well he asked me, did you know that Dr. King in The Bahamas? Yeah, he was on an Island, a little Island called Bimini. And Bob was like his history book. Well, he starts going into the fact that in 1964, he had learned that he won the Nobel peace prize. And I started talking to him about Dr. King and his speech and how part of that speech came from Bimini. A lot of people don't know that he was there in The Bahamas and don't know the significance of both of our countries coming together. And the thing about Dr. King was he was not only a great leader, he was not only a great speaker, he was a great writer. He wrote all of his speeches. You know we were surprised to say the least when Dr. King won the Nobel prize. He thought he was dreaming. He was just all struck. Then we decided, how are we gonna get the speech done? Normally, Dr. King went to Jamaica, but he said, I know too many people, I won't get the time, too many people know where I am. A friend of his down in Florida said, we can take you to Bimini. And he had to start working on this speech immediately. The next morning we got up and got on a little sea plane. And so Adam Clayton Powell lived in Bimini, Bahamas. Dr. King wanted to go over there to get Adam Clayton Powell to help him get the civil rights bill passed. And he was getting tremendous amount of pressure from J, Edgar. By the second or third day we were there. All of a sudden we saw this squadron of helicopters coming in and we wondered what was going on. They told us that J. Edgar Hoover went off on Martin Luther King winning the Nobel prize and that he was the world's most notorious liar. Well, Martin hadn't said anything to him. And we had not even hardly criticized 'cause even though we knew we were being followed by the FBI president, John Kennedy told Martin that Hoover was claiming that there were communists taking over our organization, supplying us with money and all and he had okayed the surveillance. And so we had no objection to that. Dr. King, Andrew Young, Ralph Abernathy, they didn't tell anybody they were going to The Bahamas, but their wives, but they didn't realize that J. Edgar Hoover had their phones tapped. He knew they would want over there. We found out later that Hoover had been nominated by members of Congress for the Nobel prize. It upset him for Martin to get it. And he'd been wanting it for many years. I don't know what is so important about these prizes. And J. Edgar Hoover lobbied in Congress to get all these people to speak for him and to endorse him and everything. And all of a sudden this 35 year old black preacher scoop it you know, gets the Nobel peace prize. I think it led Martin know that this was of global significance and it really served to motivate him. I was with him there for three or four days and he hardly ever talked to me and he was in the spirit. Adam Clayton Powell figured, I've got to get him away from those FBI agents. And the only way I can do that, they were gonna get him into the mangroves of The Bahamas. And in order to get into the mangroves, you had to have a guide. Because you'd get in and you can't get out, you're die inside there. So they had this guy by the name of Ansul Saunders. [SOFT BEAT MUSIC] Ansul Saunders is a legendary fishing guide on the Island of Bimini in The Bahamas. He was the one who took Dr. King into the mangroves to find peace and inspiration. And then Ansul is still taking folks there to this day. Came to Brighton for the Nobel prize acceptance speech. I was sure of this spot. I went, reach there stop over there [INDISTINCT] stuff was running on the Mangroves. He woke up and said, "I believe now more than ever "in the existence of God." He said, "Over my hand, I see freedom here, "there must be a God somewhere." He said, "I'm still hoping people see all this life and yet not believe in existence of God." Someones life on wrongs, life on the runs. He looked up and he said, "I feel as though I can almost reach out "and touch the face to good and touch the face of God." [SOFT BEAT MUSIC] Powell talked to me about the fact that wouldn't it be great if you were able to go to that place, and said I've been to the place where Dr. King went it's beautiful. He said, "How would you like to go to that place "and do a painting of the same one Dr. King was?" Well, I thought this was just a conversation. And so I said, "Man, that'd be great." And all of a sudden he picks up his telephone he starts calling somebody. And he said, "Yeah, he's sitting right here with me now. "You wanna talk to him?" And he hands me the phone. I said, "Who is this?" He said, "He's the governmental officials from the Bahamas." Sounds crazy I dropped the phone on the floor. He said, "Pick up the phone." Well, I've known a lot of folks in Bimini, in different places for a long time. Actually, since my playing days. They asked me if I would like to come over there and I said, yes. And would you like to meet out Ansal's Saunders, 'cause he's still alive? He took Dr. King and we have him to meet you and everything when you get there. We going to The Bahamas that they take me to meet Ansal Saunders. We're going, and we start getting closer and closer to the mangroves. And we're turning like this right here and I can see a turn over here and he'll turn this way. And I looked to my left and there's above the platform that's coming up out of the mangroves. And on top of that, there's a bust of Dr. King. And this was a place where Dr. King was never felt the spirit of God like this in my life. Steve was just absolutely blown away by the stories over there and Dr. King's presence, which is still there. I didn't sleep that night because I kept thinking about the experience. And I remember coming back and finishing the painting, taking it to Atlanta, showed it to ambassador Young, he went crazy. He said, I'm going with you back over there when you unveil it and he did. Bimini, beautiful place. I had no idea where ambassador Young and I were going, all I know is something historic place about Dr. King and then outcomes during the ceremony, this gentleman, by the name of Steve Skipper about his work, his art and him doing something revolutionary for Dr. King and canonizing his moment in Bimini. Low and behold, I didn't know that he was the artist that put the art in our office. That was the Selma painting. And so I always marveled at that painting. But then now seeing this particular work about King, it gave a different perspective of how to think about artists for me. And we went over and we unveil it, different people from Bimini government, people from the house of parliament NASA were there dignitaries wants to put reproductions of it in the airport so people could see it. And it's never been unveiled here in America. And so that's what we're planning now. I really hope that he continues doing it what he's doing. If he can really get some traction, I think he make a huge difference. I'm a believer that art moves the culture and not the other way around. I think he is an important figure at the right time in our history to help clean up a lot of this nonsense and get people talking to each other again. And his work makes you do that. And what you're seeing tonight one of the most important moments really in 20th century, American history is brought to oil and canvas in a way that has rarely been achieved. [SOFT BEAT MUSIC] When I saw Steve Skipper's paintings, the most powerful thing about them, he includes people of all races, genders, clearly shows that the fight for civil rights for equality has always been won by alliances of people whose voices will be raised rather than silent. Whether or not it is a family portrait, whether or not it's sports, whether or not it's civil rights, whether or not it's religion, he's looking at it as an opportunity to do something and bring the best at the end of it that he's painting. He's a wonder, I call him a wonder. Quality of his pictures, the detail of his pictures, how many he can put out. The great Renaissance painters moved an entire continent. Steve could end up having the gift of being a prophet. If his work can continue like this, the power of it is such that he could bring about an extraordinary amount of healing in this land. And boy, do we need it? I believe that what self-centered men have torn down, men of a Senate can build up. I still believe that one day mankind will bow before the altars of God and be crowned triumphant over war and bloodshed that we shall overcome. This faith can give us courage to face the uncertainties of the future. It will give out tired feet, new strengths as we continue our forward strive toward the city of freedom. I still believe. I was once told by a great golfer that the game of golf is filled with great technique. If you perfect the technique of the swing, the ball happened to get completely in the way. In 1964, God called Dr. Martin Luther King Jr away from the stress, pressure and laid out the civil rights movement to himself. This was a crucial time. Dr. King using perfected spiritual swing, hit the golf ball and ended up in the face of God in the mangroves of Bimini. There in the peace that passes all understanding, he took dictation from God. Added strength and passion to finish the movement strong and to feel the great calling on his life. Which greater and amazing grace of God has allowed me to do a painting and an unlimited edition that celebrates Dr. King sabbatical to Bimini. I pray that this will inspire you to find your Bimini as you perfect a swing of the Holy spirit. Bimini was like the golf ball that got in the way at the technique of a perfected spiritual swing was completed. [SOFT BEAT MUSIC] Find your Bimini, I found mine.
