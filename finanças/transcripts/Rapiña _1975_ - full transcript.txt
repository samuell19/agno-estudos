See you tomorrow, Porfirio. - See you tomorrow, brother. So, how's he been? Pretty bad. He was even talking to himself. Well, sure. He's running a very high fever. I served him his bitter tea, but it didn't help... I think we got it wrong. I don't think this is indigestion. I told you, Porfirio. This is for the doctor. Yes, but, how can I ask him when I still owe him for the last call? What's it to him? He can put it on your tab. My tab... He's not Sim?n from the store. Whatever! Pops dying would be much worse. I'll go see if Evodio can help. I'll be right back. Don't you worry, brother. I've had worse fevers and I'm still alive and kicking. It's not the same. Pops is old, and I don't even know what's got him. Sure you won't eat with us, brother? Thanks, sister, but, how could I be hungry? Look, compadre, we're totally broke, but... we've got that little pig. No, brother, no way. What are friends for? Besides, we were about to slaughter it. So, we'll just pretend we've eaten it already and that's that. It's the only one you have, Evodio. Never mind, Porfirio. It probably feels all alone. Take it! No... I doesn't feel right... Porfirio... Wouldn't you do the same thing for me? Yes, of course. - There you go, it's settled. OK, brother. Now you can stop worrying and have some beans with us. C'mon. There's nothing to be done now. We'll go to town together tomorrow. Just because it's you who's asking, Porfirio. Nobody in town will pay you this much. Thank you. - Listen, how's Don Andr?s doing? Badly. That's what the money's for, to pay the doctor. Right, well, send him my regards. Thanks, I'll be seeing you. Hello, Porfirio. What brings you here? I came to see you, doctor, because Pops is really ill. Wait a little while. Have a seat. Did you know there's a teacher for the school? That's good, Mr. Doctor. - I'm talking to him. I'll be with you when I'm done. - Whatever you say. Doctor, I won't take up any more of your time. I just wanted to introduce myself. I was told to contact the important people. So who told you that I'm important? Don't be so modest. I've heard a lot about you. We'll talk some other time. I don't know if I should wish you luck. It'd be like sentencing you to remain here. That's why I've come. You don't know what you're doing. Burying yourself in this filthy place. Among this rabble. These are the people I want to help. I'd like to offer them a horizon. The only horizon that interests them is the one on the hills. None of them will go any further. That might be so, but, what's so bad about living here? It's like... being nowhere. Like living out of this world. It's like you said... We'll strive to integrate this lost community into the civilized world. I believe any town can become a great city. Very good, professor. I think your classes will be very nice. One day, I might go and listen in on one. In exchange, I'll invite you to share my experiences. Look... Whenever I help deliver a newborn... I always wonder what the son of one of these savages will be good for. For nothing... except simply vegetating... and leading an empty life. Then they'll just die without achieving or leaving anything behind. As if they had never existed. And what would you have them do? We haven't given them any incentives, we haven't educated them. All we do is despise them and forget about them. What have we given them? Me? Many years of my life. And you can't imagine how much I regret it. Why, doctor? You're doing an important job here! Nothing is important here. Living and dying are just biological phenomena. Nothing changes anything. We're all already dead. Then why are you here, doctor? - Hmm... I don't know. I've thought of leaving a thousand times, but stayed. I think their apathy has rubbed off on me. Besides, it's too late to start all over again somewhere else. It's unsettling to hear you talk like that. Yes... You'll get to know them. It took years for them to hear a radio without crossing themselves in fear. They're true animals. True beasts. Is that what he said? And a lot of other things. I didn't understand some of them, but they sounded bad. Well, the doctor really seemed to like us. I guess he doesn't. He said he's always wanted to leave but couldn't. Let him think what he wants... As long as your father gets better. Yeah... But when I heard him talking I felt disgust. Thanks for everything, doctor. - Don't forget to buy the medication. How is he, doctor? He's very frail. I'll come to see him tomorrow. Call me if he gets worse. Porfirio... - What is it? The money! - Yes... you're right! Doctor! I managed to get a small amount... I hope you'll forgive me. It's all right, Porfirio. Until tomorrow. You shouldn't have spent that money... on the healer. It's all over for me. Don't say that, Pops. Don't you want to live? - What on earth for? I've already done my part. Pops, how can I get peace of mind? By working... being honest, and having children. That's exactly what I've done. The boy's about to be born, but... what then? Well, then... Didn't you ever want to leave, Pops? - What for? Well... just... so that everything's not always the same. No, Porfirio. We have a lot to do here. Wherever you go, you'll be like a stranger. You'll be fighting against others... No... We have to work here... on that little parcel of land that's ours. Yes, well... so what's the other side of the world for? For the ones that live there. They have their own problems. Otherwise, we'd all live piled up. No, Porfirio. No... Don't even think about it. Settle down here, in our village... until your time comes. Like me... What's wrong, Porfirio? Don't feel like working today? Listen, Evodio. If we shouldn't leave the village like Pops says... then why did they build the road? Hmm, well... I don't know. - Weird, isn't it? I think they built it from there to here. That must be it! What's with you? - Nothing. Keep still. You don't love me anymore! Again! It's not that, you're wrong. It's just that Pops is ill. What's wrong, Porfirio? You've been really strange lately. You sure smell good! He seems to be bewitched. He doesn't even work now. Just spends his time thinking. So what's he thinking? - He wants his kid to be born elsewhere. So he won't die here. What does he care where we die? Then he starts talking about seeing the world, being different from the animals. How do you like that? Fina! Yes, Evodio, I heard you. He's all happy because of his son. I don't see him quite so happy. The other day he was moaning about how bad and ugly the town was. Well, sometimes you get bored of always seeing the same stuff. My God! You almost agree with him. You won't believe me, but when I was pregnant with our child that died... I got to thinking that it would be nice to have money and live differently. Nothing to be done about that now. We were born poor and we'll die poor. That's right. Is it serious, doctor? Yes. Come with me. I've got some medicine he'll need in my office. At your orders, doctor. Come. Where the devil did I put that? Here it is. Are we all like that, doctor? - All of us. But this one's been skinned, hasn't he? - That's right. Very ugly. - Depends on your point of view. We're even worse on the inside. Here. Give him one of these every three hours. Do you think Pops will get better, doctor? I don't know, Porfirio. He's gotten old. But I'll do all I can. Nobody dodges that, Porfirio. Consider that Pops has lived his life... - What good did it do him? He spent it all like a little animal. Like you say. I? I hope you forgive me but I overheard what you told the school teacher. Well... Sometimes I'm having a bad day, and... talk too much. You don't really care if a local person dies, right? It's not me, Porfirio. It's the others. If you only knew how big the world is... you'd be scared to realize what a small place we live in. So how do we get out of here, doctor? It's not a question of leaving, Porfirio. Rather, it's the wish to better yourself, to improve, to progress. Instead of being so easily contented. - I do want to leave this place, doctor! What should I do? Nothing. Just have desire and bravery. A drink? Do you want my advice, Porfirio? Don't think about it. Don't think about it, or you'll wind up like me. What's your problem, Camilo? - What's wrong with you, Porfirio? You won't serve me a drink? You've had enough. I want another drink! - You've had enough, Porfirio. What is it to you? My drink! Porfirio, go back home. Take my advice. Your father's very ill. So what? We're all going to die anyway. Did you hear that, people? We're all going to die! And nobody will give a damn! What will you do about it? - Enough, Porfirio. Don't provoke them. And you too will rot here because you don't know how huge the world is! And what do I care about that? That's just it! You don't have the guts the leave! I'm not moving from here. Look, Porfirio. I had a great uncle who had the same obsession. He left for the big city. Do you know how he ended up? Penniless! No... Things are awful over there. Don't even think about it, Porfirio. But I... I don't want to spend my life chopping trees. I don't want to die like Pops! I don't want to die that way! I don't want to die that way! You have to accept it, Porfirio. It's God's will. Mr. Priest... What happens when you die? Well, if you've been good, kind to your neighbor and obeyed the Church... you'll go to Heaven. And what then? There is no sorrow, pain, or hunger over there. Over there you'll have everlasting joy. Always in the same place? You won't be thinking about that over there. Then it's better to travel the world before kicking the bucket. Porfirio, if God put you in this place there's a reason for it. The doctor was right, then. You only leave this place when you're dead! - Good morning, sister. Good morning, brother. What's up with Evodio? His foot is really swollen today. Hmm. Could it be that my brother's trying to dodge work? No, brother, it's really bad. Come and see for yourself. What is it, Evodio? Just take a look at how bad my foot is. It doesn't look good, brother. It's full of pus. It's due to that splinter yesterday. But I don't know how it got infected. It must be that bad breeze at the cemetery, right brother? Yeah, it must be that. You'd better squeeze it, brother. And make him a leaf poultice. - Yes, I'll do that. Looks like you'll be alone today, brother. It's all good. I'll check on you when I return. I think I'll be fine by tomorrow. I'm leaving, sister. - Go with God, brother. Have a good day. You were gone a long time, Porfirio. I was getting worried. I went further out today. How did it go? I'll tell you now. I'm hungry. - I'll serve your food. Any news here? Nothing much. I went around an Evodio is better. Anything else? - Just that. The herbs did him good. He'll go with you tomorrow. Where were you at noon? - What's that about? I'm asking you where you were! Over there, with Fina and Evodio! I even helped out Fina. Didn't you hear anything? - Hear what? Whatever. Did you hear or not? What's up? You're acting strange. - What's strange about it? I want to know if you heard one of those low-flying planes. As if I had nothing else to do but to listen for planes. One fell down today. Where? Over the high part of the hill. I went to see if I could help out, but... they're all dead! Have you already spoken to the police? No. - What are you waiting for? You don't know what's up there. There's a lot of good stuff! And I think nobody saw the plane falling. All the stuff could be ours. But that would be like stealing! - Stealing? From whom? The dead? Yes! Even if they can't complain, it's just not right. We've never taken anything from anybo... Let's be clear that if Evodio doesn't agree, it's over. If I tell Evodio I'll have to give him half of it. So what? - So what? It's a lot of money! Porfirio! Evodio has always shared everything with us. He even gave you his piglet to help Pops! All right. And don't you dare tell anyone! I'd have to be crazy. Well, I'll be! I leave you alone for one day and look what happens. Nothing to do with me! It was an act of God. The Devil, rather, brother. Do you think the Lord would bring down a plane? Well, it happened. And only we know about it. I don't know what to say, brother. I'll have to think about it. What did your wife say? At the beginning she was reluctant like you. She considered it a theft. If the owner doesn't complain... - That's for sure. And if there's a racket, other people will come and profit. The brother's right. - It's our only chance to beat poverty. No. I don't know, brother. I'm not convinced. Listen! What if we ask the priest? No, we're behind schedule. - And maybe he'll want us to tithe. Or perhaps even worse. What do you say, Evodio? We'll talk on the way. Bless you, sister. It's a steep climb, brother. Be thankful it's not yesterday's path. It was much worse, brother. Have you thought it over, Porfirio? Yes... I'll never get lucky like this again. And when they ask us where the money comes from? They won't know. - C'mon! I'm leaving this place, Evodio. At it again, brother? And if you were smarter you'd do the same. I don't even have a place to go. The world is a huge place, brother! And with money in your pocket... I'll think it over. Move, you lazy donkey! O brother, so many dead! Yes. These airplanes carry a lot of people! Come. Look, Porfirio, it works! Take it, brother. It might be useful. What's that, brother? I wonder... We'd better leave. We have enough, brother. You want to leave the rest here? We can't take everything. - Of course we can! With about twenty trips to the cavern we can get everything. Twen... They'll come for the dead before that! That's why we have to choose the best stuff! Get on with it! Brother... Good morning. - Morning. I told you it had fallen around here. - So many dead! No one survived! Look, Tiburcio! A clock! Leave it. It belongs to the gentlemen. You won't believe me, but we're just looking. So, what's that? They're orders. And how do you know who owns what when it's all scattered? Well... nobody really knows. You won't mind if we grab some stuff for us? No. Why? Can we share the goods? - Sure, but those were ordered. Well, take them, then. We'll be fine with what's left. Did you see anyone else around? Nobody. Not even a trace of anyone. We were close by. We've got a charcoal deposit on the other side. That's good. If you'll excuse us... It looks bad, Porfirio. The still have to go back. No more water, Jos?. - Well, we hadn't planned coming here. It's a miracle there was some left. Do you two live far away? On the San Camilo path. You've got a long walk. Plus you'll have a lot of things to carry. You'd be better off with several trips. No way! In a while we'll have soldiers and others snooping around. Didn't you bring donkeys? - We left them with the charcoal. I can go get them. - Thing is I'm already hungry. Don't worry about that, my friend. We brought some tacos. Well, if you'd do us the favor... Of course. We're Christians, after all. I'll go get the donkeys. Tiburcio! I'd better go with you. Don't want to be alone with those two. Who'll look after the stuff? Give me the machete. What's with you, Porfirio? Why feed them? Why not? Without the donkeys, they had to leave with less stuff. They won't be taking anything. Fix the tacos. What do you need that for, amigo? There's nothing to cut. It got in his way. Well, gentlemen. Until we meet again. What's your hurry, amigo. Night will soon fall and we're far away. We're on the same path, let's stick together. Of course. We're both carrying valuable goods. Please excuse our bad manners. It's just that... we didn't know you were heading the same way. That's where his humble home is located. Thank you. Well, let's be on our way. What's up, Evodio? - Why the long trek, brother? So they don't leave with the stuff, what else? Have you planned it all? - Every little bit. If they start blabbering around town, our goose is cooked. Go on, brother. Their fate is sealed. Don't you want to sleep a while, amigo? I'm just not sleepy. - It happens sometimes. What will you say about the stuff you're taking? Nothing. We'll stow it away and sell it later. Little by little. Good idea. I think we'll do the same. Right, Jos?? - Sure! Because if we let on, there's going to be a bunch of people coming to loot. Yeah... and the police. That's right. It's best to keep our mouths shut. Don't worry about us, we'll keep quiet. So we're all agreed. Nobody will know. We... don't even know each other. It's cold. If you want to get some sleep... I'm not sleepy at all. So if you want to sleep... Well, you might be right. Brother, if we fall asleep we'll never see the dawn. I know! I'm just pretending. But that guy won't sleep. Lo, brother! Just let the dawn come and you'll see. What happened? No! Don't kill me! Is he dead? - I don't think so. Brother! Just leave him. - So he can tell on us? But... in cold blood? We're already in the hole. C'mon. There's plenty to do. Just leave them like that? We can't bury them. - They'll find them, brother. What do we care, Evodio? When did we come to this place? - Well... never. There you go! Let's go. Did you notice there was nobody on the path? Yeah! Nobody saw us! Thank God. - Don't mention him, Porfirio. What are you worried about? That's what I'd like to know. Just that. What God thinks of us. It can't be very good, with those two dead today. There are other dead people in the world. What's that got to do with it? God has other people to watch, besides us. Yeah... But I had never killed anybody before. Nothing's changed. You didn't do anything. Yeah... but I let you do it. Look, Evodio... This is the first time in my life I have something of value. If you had gotten in the way... you'd have suffered the same fate as them. Are you that crazy about this stuff? We've always been poor. But I had never felt so small and tied down before. Now we'll become decent people! Don't you understand? Yeah, well... To be frank, I can't stop thinking about those two. Don't you think they would've done the same to us? Don't worry about it, brother. C'mon, give me a hand with this. What about their donkeys? We'll let them loose. They know their way back home. What if the police arrested them? There's no police up there on the hills. They're not goats. Something's up. They've never taken so long. They had to get all the stuff and then go on to the cavern. Don't worry. God willing. Will we really be rich? Just think of all the stuff that fits in the belly of a plane like that. Probably around 500 pesos. You think so? Minimum. Well! Then I'll ask Evodio to buy me a new mortar and another shawl. What for, sister? We'll be leaving soon. Evodio hasn't mentioned anything. He'll tell you. He's now obsessed like Porfirio. You'll see... What is it? - They're here! We're here. You took so long! - It's very far. Let's see! What did you bring? - Nothing! Really! - We told you beforehand. It's all in the cavern. Not even a radio so we can listen to music? What for? You never listen to it. Come to think of it, we did bring something. For all of us? No... my brother here brought the same amount. Can I touch them? Fina! What are you doing? Did you hear me? What are you doing with the money? I... I just wanted to count it. What for? Didn't you already know the amount? Yes... But since I saw it in my dreams, I woke up and thought it wasn't true. I wish it were. What's wrong, Evodio? Aren't you glad? I am... But frankly, I can't stop thinking it's ill-gotten money. But didn't you yourselves say that if you didn't take the stuff, others would? Yes, of course. So, stop worrying. Do like I do... and think of nice things. In all the things we can buy. Look, Porfirio! Will you buy it for me? Take them! - And I'll take these, they're nice. I want a pair of shoes. What? - Are you mad, you've never worn shoes! Good reason to get a pair. - Your feet will hurt, brother. After a while you get used to them. - That's right, you need to progress! How much are these? - For you, sixty pesos. I'll take them. I told you! You're so stubborn. It's just the first few days. I'll wear them again tomorrow! Right, until you become a cripple! - So how do people get used to them? Because they start when they're kids, not when they have huge feet like yours. Maybe so, but we're not going barefoot to the city. Is that still on your mind? - More than ever. Now there's no reason for us to remain stuck in this... filthy town. Now we have plenty of money! What are we going to do there? Whatever. We can start a business selling... something. We'll be all by ourselves. Here, at least we have our brethren. No! Evodio and Fina are coming with us. Did you speak to him? - Not yet, but I think he's all set. So, when will you show us the stuff you took? I... don't know. The cavern is far away and you're in no condition... I can go slowly. Look, tomorrow Fina and I can go the hill where you are. We'll take your lunch, and when you're finished, you can take us to the cavern. What's your hurry? Can't you wait? Well... to be honest, no. You know that we're rich... I have trouble believing it. OK. Make your plans with Fina, then. What's up? Why did you go so far? Since we're going to the cavern, it's better to be close by. Fine, so let's be on our way! What the...? Didn't you bring the food? - Yes, but we can all eat at the cavern. No way! You two were strolling. We were working and we're hungry! Not me. What's with you, then? - It's early and I'm not hungry yet. Well... You guys win, let's go to the cavern. It's really dark, isn't it? What if someone comes in? - To do what here? You never know. I think it would be better to bury it all. We'll see, we'll see. Go on! - We're getting there, brother. So how will we get the stuff out? - There's enough room for the donkeys. There it is. What? You two made such a racket and now you just stand there! Is it all there? Have you seen this, Rita? It'll look good in the city! It's not complete, Evodio. The top part is missing. I couldn't wear it like this and showing everything, right? Well, well. How do you like this? Isn't it pretty? Evodio, what animal does this this fur come from? It's got to be rabbit, what else? - Don't think so, brother. Maybe a rare rabbit we haven't seen. Can I take it home? Where will you go? What will we tell people? We'll say nothing. I just want it as a blanket. It's so warm... No, no. Keep calm, sister. We can't take anything from here. So what good did it do that you... found it? We need to wait a few days. Be patient. Listen. Are these the... the really expensive kind? Sure thing, sister. The dead were all very high class. Can I take it home? Sure! I saw it and grabbed it for the baby. Let me see, Rita. - Look! It's so cute! But it's dirty here. It's blood! Your pain isn't normal, Rita. Have you been working too hard? Well, doctor, she's got to work to prepare the food. Maybe it's because I walked so much yesterday. Lie down over there. The other way. - Huh? On the other side. - Oh. Will the baby be harmed, doctor? - Porfirio, don't even think about that. But you have to be careful. - Like what happened to Evodio's son? That was different. Well... everything seems normal. - Really? Yes, but... I want to examine Rita again next month. We might not be here by then, doctor. We're leaving for the city. You'll have it your way, right? It's not because of me. I want the kid to grow up somewhere else. Where he won't grow up as an animal. Where he can study. Sounds good, Porfirio. I wish we could all do the same. Why don't you leave also, doctor? Me? Because I'm afraid. - How's that? Yes... I lack the courage to fight and start again. Fear is like a cage, Porfirio. And when you're coward you stay trapped inside forever. That's it, Rita! Tell her, doctor. Tell her that we're all dead here! Not so much dead as frightened. I don't want my son to be born and for you to think he's a savage's son! No, Porfirio. Nobody will think that about your son. So the doctor agrees? - Sure! And I think he envies me too. And he told me that Rita will get better attention in the city. So what's she got? He didn't say, but I think it might be the baby's position. So... when would we be leaving, Porfirio? We'll wait another ten days. Then we sell the stuff and we can leave. You know what, Porfirio? I was thinking yesterday it might be good to confess myself. Which sin? - All of them. The simple truth is that I'm not at peace with myself. Just hang on, brother! It's all right to come clean with God... But at least wait until we sell the stuff. Right, but... what for? I know that priest. If you tell him he'll say we have to return everything. If it's already sold, there's no way to return it. - Think so? You bet! Besides, he's got to forgive you anyway. That's what they're there for. You're right. Porfirio! Porfirio! - What is it? There's a commotion in town, lots of people! Police and photographers! They found the airplane. When was this? - In the morning. There's a whole bunch of cars! They make so much noise. It was bound to happen. - What do we do now? Nothing at all. We didn't even know the plane had fallen. Ready, major. The rescue brigade is already there. Right, captain. We'll be leaving in 30 minutes. What about your guides? They went to get them. It shouldn't take long. Tell those people to go back to work. They do nothing but hinder us. I'm on it! The journalists will be on their own. They're not coming with us. Just in case it gets complicated. Mr. Secretary, get rid of all these people! You all go home now! Nothing here for you, get going! C'mon! Everybody go back home. Didn't you hear? You! Get out of here. Get moving! Hi. What's all the fuss about? A trifle! A plane crashed onto a hill and many people are dead. How did they find out? - Who knows? But there were some small airplanes flying around and they found it. And now they'll bring the dead. - Strange things happen. Why didn't you apply to be a guide? The money's good. Me? - Yes! But I've never been to the top of the hill! Because you didn't want to. - It's too far! And you can get lost. Alpine, rescue, Alpine rescue, service patrol calling, service patrol calling. The aircraft has been found. The aircraft has been found. XZB XZB There are no survivors. There are no survivors. We're working. We're working inside the aircraft. Major, other bodies have been found below. What? - This neighbor found them. Were they passengers? I don't think so. By their clothes, I'd say they worked with charcoal. From what this man says, it seems to be a homicide. There's a lot of blood. I think machetes were involved. Captain, take four men and have a look. Let's see what this is all about. Just what I needed. What are you staring at, Evodio? - I wonder what's going on over there. You know... They're probably collecting the dead bodies. I hope it's only that. Listen, what if we go and see? No, brother. It's like telling them we're worried and we know the way up. So what? It must be full of snoops. - That's their problem. Maybe they're the ones that stole the stuff, right? Yeah... That's it. - What's the problem, captain. - Sorry to make you come down, major... But I think we found something important. Have a look. Were they murdered? Yes, but that might be unrelated to our investigation. Look at this. This was found on the other one. These two got to the plane before we did. Yes... And whoever killed these two also got there early. Halt! Hey, you! Do you know if anyone from the town heard the plane fall? What plane, sir? No, major. I don't know them. - Are you sure? They're not from this town. Besides, no one's missing here. What other towns are in the area? San Francisco, La Marquesa, Casaonda, La Paz... Lots of them. We'll have to check them all. Why do you think it's related to the plane? They were carrying this stuff. - Do you think robbery was the motive? No other explanation. It's either that or they quarreled over the loot. Just suppose they stumbled upon a suitcase that fell far away. All the luggage was opened. The locks either broken or opened with keys. It's a clear-cut case. So what will we do, then? We can't waste any time. Let's send the bodies to the capital. So you can begin investigating their identity. We'll send people to continue with the investigation. We have to find out who suddenly got rich, or who's selling the loot. They won't get away. You have my word. It's what we were waiting for; they've come to get the dead. I never imagined they'd be such a commotion, soldiers and what have you. Why not? The plane was full of important people. There you go. - What do you mean? What do we care? Isn't that right, sister? I agree. What do we care what they do? Sure. The wait is over. And if they found something? They wouldn't have left. They'd be asking around. So why don't we wait. Selling now or in a month's time is the same. No, I'm fed up with this place! The sooner we sell the stuff the better. The brother's right, Evodio. If we're going to leave, the sooner the better. Yeah. So where do we go? - I say San Blas. There are lots of shops. And if we go tomorrow, there's a fair. Fine, it's tomorrow then. Hold on, brother! - And now what? Take a look. Take a look at the hidden stuff. Everything's visible through the firewood. I was thinking about that. What do we do if somebody wants to buy the firewood? My brother is a smart aleck. We just won't sell it! So how much are we going to ask for all of this? First we'll have a look at the shops and ask around. When we find out the prices, we'll sell. You think of everything, Porfirio. - It's the only way! Move on, donkey! Look, brother, that's one of those things we have. Nice, eh? - I'll ask about it. So what is it? - It's for shaving. How does it work? - Who knows? I didn't ask about that. Where did you get it from? It belongs to my brother. I got it from my friend the doctor, as payment for some work. I have no need for it. - Do you have a sales receipt? It's got everything. Can't you see it's new? You didn't understand. I'm talking about the ownership paper. No, I didn't get one of those papers. That makes it difficult. I'll give you 500 pesos. You take us for ignorant Indians. You sell it for much more! Sure, I've got to make a profit! - Yeah, but no so much! All my goods come with a receipt. - What's the purpose of that? As proof that the goods aren't stolen. When I sell a piglet there's no paper... - Just give us the money. You shouldn't have! - Just this, then we'll go elsewhere. Fifty pesos. As if we were starving. Don't you think we know what it's worth? It might be worth a lot, but this one's used. Says who? - Look, the glass is scratched. No one's going to pay more for it. How did you get it? Give me the money. What now, brother? I don't know what to do. It'll be the same everywhere. - Yes, it's hard with the "receigs". If I had known I would have looked for them in the plane. Did you hear that guy in the store? He just about called us burglars. What are we going to do? Let's go back. - What about all the stuff? With the money we have we can leave. It'll be easier to sell it in the city. I'm splitting now, Porfirio. I really want to see Fina. Go on, brother. Tell her to get all her things ready to leave. I gave you your money, right? See you tomorrow, brother. It's all right, Rita. It's me. You took a long time. - It was difficult to sell the goods. What's that? - Just some stuff from San Blas. We weren't able to sell everything. - Good. - What? - You don't know what went on in town! I'm really upset. The police came back! It's probably just to collect the things they left behind. Collect nothing! They were asking everybody questions. What were they asking? - They found some dead charcoal workers! They had things from the plane! I didn't see anyone. - Maybe they got there before you. What's that got to do with us? It's better if they're the suspects. They're dead, after all. They're looking for the killers. Porfirio, I'm really afraid. - Afraid of what? We're leaving! Before they even know. I didn't see anything. I didn't see anything. I didn't! I've told you! Your house is very near that place. You must have seen them. - Why? I always go the other way! Which other way? The other way! Not the way you expect but the other! Let him be. It wasn't him, take my word. I know him well. He's a good person. Good persons also behave badly, Mayor. Not this one. I'll answer for him. You can go. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thank you! It's back to square one, major. Not quite. At least we know they were from San Camilo. Yes, but that's not much help. Whoever killed those two could have come from any of the towns nearby. Or even from a faraway place. We'll find them when they try to sell the loot. They'll probably wait for a while. You don't know these people. As soon as they have some money they'll spend it. Yes, but to sell all those modern appliances... all those clocks and other stuff can only be sold in San Blas. We should notify the Mayor's office, so they can warn the shops. Good idea, captain. Well, I'll be, major. I admire your composure. You're really sure we'll catch them, aren't you? I'd bet my arm. Sooner or later they'll make a mistake and we will find out. Who is it? Who is it? - It's me, sister, open up. Evodio. Evodio, it's Porfirio! Porfirio's outside! What's up, brother? - Open, brother. We have to talk now. Right away. Come in and sit down, brothers. Please excuse the mess. Good evening, little sister. What happened? Some cops arrived. They're asking questions in town. Yes, Fina had mentioned it. I've got a feeling they'll find us soon. And now, brother? - We have to gain time on the clock! You mean leave? - Well, what else? This way we'll be far away when they find out. Yes, it's the only way. We have to leave tomorrow or the day after. Tomorrow or the day after my ass! Right now. Get dressed and let's go! And how will I pack all our things so quickly? What things? We'll only take what we're wearing! And the donkey for all the stuff from the plane. I need my things. What's so valuable? Besides, they'll buy us new things in the city. Right? Sure. And hurry up so we can make it to the cavern by noon. What's wrong, Rita? - Some really strong pangs. And now what? Rita has started to feel pain and it must be the baby. Don't give me that! Now's not the moment! Just put up with it! - It's getting better... Let's go, then. - Let's go. Which way will we go once we get out of here? We have to go past the hills to Villalta, and then we'll take the train. That's really far away, brother. Yes, but it's the only way to avoid the police. It's like four days walking. - And mostly desert. What about water? There's a stream where we can get water. We'll see how much each one can carry. Forget it, brother. The donkey will die of exhaustion on the way. We can't leave this behind. It's worth a lot of money. We're carrying enough, Porfirio. Enough what? Take this. It's heavy. - Just get on with it! What about that stuff? It's my part. I prefer to leave it behind. Just leave it there, brother. What is it to you? No way, brother. The donkeys won't make it. Yeah, that seems true. There's another pass further on and it's lower. That'll take us a day longer. - So be it! Evodio! I can't go on! We're going to rest! - Let's stop, brother! Look! Come! Come and have a look at this! Is that what you liked? We still have to cross the desert. So what? They haven't caught us so far. They'll never catch us! Stop, Porfirio! The animals can't take it any longer. She's right, brother. They'll drop dead on us. It's best to rest a while. All right. How are you feeling, sister? - Not good. My legs can't support me. It would be good to stay here until sundown. Porfirio won't want to. What's wrong with him? He's really changed. He's just so worried. Where's the red flask? Damn it! It fell off and we didn't notice! - It's Ok. We've got too many things. Don't you know it was worth a lot? On the other hand we managed a good stretch. They can still reach us! Why don't we eat now? - No! There's not much left. Just wait. We won't make it that way. - I'm starving to death. I said no! Do you think I'm not hungry? But if we eat now we'll die on the way! We can still take another path. - I'm the one who decides here! Easy, Porfirio, don't be so stubborn. We all have a right to speak our mind. Look, Evodio. I already explained why I wanted to leave the town... So as not to be animals like the doctor said. To see the world! So my son doesn't end up like us, simple thieves. What's that got to do with eating now? Because we don't want to mess up, have to return and get caught! I didn't mean that. - Don't care what you meant! And if you don't like the way I'm handling it, then take you stuff and go! Porfirio! Don't pay him any mind, brother. He's just not himself. It was quite an adventure. We questioned all the shopkeepers. The ones that saw them all agreed on their description. Two of them, then? - Close friends and not from San Blas. This is the closest town to San Blas. These kind of people walk a lot. They could be from far away. The clock salesman overheard them say they'd reach town by night. That distance can only be that way from R?o Seco. One of them is called Poncio, or Porfirio, or Ponciano... Hold on... hold on... Two close friends and one of them is called Porfirio? Yes... I think I know them. Who are they? - Two lumberjacks. They live far from the accident site, but climb the hills every day. Captain! - Yes, major. Get their names and bring them here now! - Yes, major. Don't consider it a solved case. It's just an idea that came to me. Look! Evodio! Rita! Fina! Look! Water! Water! They're gone. - What? They left. Right before our eyes. Damn it! - They're good people. Maybe they're just out chopping wood. Sometimes they spend the night there. No. The women aren't there either. Nor the donkeys. It's all a mess. The doors were open. They probably got scared when we started asking around. They can't be far. Captain, call the city and have them send reinforcements. We need to form patrols to chase them. - Yes, major. Brother, sister! Evodio's made a fire. Come. We're coming, sister. Take the donkeys and tie them up somewhere. Now we're good, Rita. Now that we have this water we'll be fine. Feel happy? - Of course. I was really worried about the water. Because we can deal with hunger. Is the money that important? It's not the money! I would've left even without the stuff. But ever since we left the village... I... feel something... in here... It's... really strange. Like... total joy! You couldn't take the town any longer. - I couldn't even stand myself! We were like... tied down, Rita. But not now! Now I'm not afraid of going anywhere! We were like... prisoners, as the doctor used to say. It's good, isn't it? We've escaped, Rita. We're out of the cage! Rita! Rita, it's morning! Evodio! Brother Evodio, wake up! We have to go on. Damn! It was cold last night. Yeah, but in a while the heat will be unbearable. Stand up. Evodio! Evodio! Rita! Come! I'll be damned! Evodio! Evodio! - What is it? The donkeys are gone! - What do you mean? - They're gone! How will we take the stuff now? I asked you to tether them! What did you do? I just brought them over. I told you to tie them down! Idiot! Moron! Leave her, you son of a...! Don't you ever hit my wife again! Evodio! Murderer! - Don't you move, sister. Don't move! I'm serious. Murderer! The Jeeps can go through this road until the edge of the desert. Do you think that's where they are? - It's likely. Major! We got an answer from headquarters. They're sending a police helicopter. Good. Be on the lookout for its arrival. It'll be easier to explore the desert. And the patrols? - They all left 30 minutes ago. The whole area is covered. Look, captain. Send a Jeep with three men to this place. Isn't that on the other side of the hills? Yes, that's where the desert starts. If the chopper finds them there, I want to be ready. We'll find them soon! Evodio! If you find them, come straight back to where Torres is. Yes, sir. You'll probably find them on the way down from the hills. I imagine the road is visible from the air. Good luck, captain. - At your orders, major. Listen, captain. If night falls on you, join the Jeeps. And don't come back until you find those guys! Porfirio, I can't go on! What's wrong? Why did you do it, Porfirio? He was your friend! He was going to kill me, didn't you see? And all because of that stupid hag! All the stuff we had to leave behind! Is that all you think about? In the money you lost? Don't you feel sorry about killing Evodio? Don't even mention it. It's better to forget about that. You and I might forget. But she will never forget. Where's the sister? - Heeding nature's call. She's run away! Porfirio! She was going back to tell on us. I swear that if she'd stayed with us I wouldn't have killed her. She was my sister! We loved each other so much! It's not a game. I killed a man. If they catch me, I'll spend my life in jail! What good will the money do us now? We'll never be happy! Don't talk like that, Rita. We'll go to the city! Everything will be nicer there! You'll have the money you need, and... Think of the kid! I'm thinking of him! What will I tell him now? That his father's a murderer! Yes... Tell him that. But tell him I did it for him! So he wouldn't be born in a stinky village! So he could become a decent person! Not true! That's not true! It's all your fault! You and your damned obsession to go somewhere else! Because you want to be rich! - Yes, what's wrong with that, Rita? It's like you're someone else. You changed completely. I don't even know you now. I don't even love you anymore. No, Rita. Just hear yourself talk. I speak the truth, Porfirio. I don't love you anymore. I look at you and all I see are the people you've killed. Keep all the stuff for yourself. The stuff that's worth so much to you. I'm going back. And what am I? Chopped liver? You're my wife! No! I was your wife when you were good! But you betrayed me! You didn't tell me you had killed the charcoal workers to rob them! You never told me you could kill people so easily! Like chopping down trees! Rita! Yes, Porfirio. I knew you were going to do it. What are you waiting for? You're not leaving! Look, Porfirio. You don't care if I leave. You're just worried about not getting help to carry the stuff. I'm no good to you dead, either. subtitles: scalisto for the KG tracker
