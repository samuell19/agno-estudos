Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, oh, oh yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. - Come on baby. - Oh yeah. - Oh. Oh. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. Fucking kids and their fucking chocolate. What about What's-Her-Name at the office? The strawberry blonde. - Who? - Who? You know who. She does not like me. Hey, my picklock. Oh... magic! I'm telling you, she likes you, man. Listen. She's always on your case. You know what it means, don't you? No. She's never on my case. She's always on your case, my friend. On the cactus... Mike, on the cactus. Nice. Yeah. She does not like me. Stop saying that. - I'm too fat. - You're not fat. You're just a little fat. You're counteracting what you're doing. You're working out, eating's carrots, doing the proteine shake and then you shovel ice cream in there. I see you do it. It's disgusting. - Stress. - Have some respect for yourself. - That's enough. - It's never enough. OK. Now it's enough. Daddy. Daddy! What? What is it? Where are my Easter eggs? Dumb furs. - What's so funny, huh? - Nothing. OK. Where'd you hide them? If I'd my way, those kids would never find those eggs. - What? - I'd hide them eggs in the ocean. Compost bin? Septic tank? What? Kitty litter? Oven? Oh, it's the oven! It's half past. Honestly. No one will ever love me. I just feel like there is no hope. I'll never be skinny. I just want to die. Does this sound familiar? Do you like thousands of others believe, that life holds no hope for you? If you're considering suicide anyway, don't make it a waste.

Let's just get this over with. So I don't have to see any of you for another month. I know you've all seen the numbers from last year. They're predicting this year will be even worse. It seems our dismal fiscal performances finally caught the attention of the big boys at the head office. So... They sent a Bogeyman to scare us out of the red and into the black. Most of you will recognize Conrad Hubriss as the genius behind Sponsored Suicide. Mr. Hubriss... Whip out your dog and pony. Thank you, Mr. Pan. Easter bunnies... are on the payroll year-round. They do not however, work 365 days a year. Now I understand that most holidays happen only once a year, but their profits justify their expenditures. Not so with Easter. Therefore my recommendation is to reduce said delivery staff by 11.341 percent. You can't fire Easter bunnies. They're... They're Easter bunnies. As it stands Easter is currently a second tier holiday. Christmas, Hanukkah, Thanksgiving, Valentine's Day, 4th of July. Those are your tier 1 holidays. High profits, international profile. Strong, strong merchandising. And there's Halloween, Kwanzaa, Easter and Canada Day. Or your second tier holidays. Less profits. Less visibility. Less perceived importance. What we have here, ladies and gentlemen is a holiday that does well. Not great. But well. And manages to chug along, year after year, just getting by. My job is to stop that sinking ship ladies and gentleman. And start making our shareholders some money. - How'd it go boys? - Oh, same shit, different year. - How's things on your end, Phil? - A fucking nightmare. A gear got jammed on the egg-painter. Now I've got to wait for a new part. They tell me it's gonna take an hour. I'll believe it when I see it. Goddamn it, Nicholas! How many times I gotta tell you. You've got to move the basket or that scissel won't shut up. (Speaking Chinese) I got over 6.5 mil eggs that I got to get over eight timezones by four. - That's a fucking nightmare, I tell you. - That's bullshit, man. You know these goddamn machines? They give me a hernia. Remember the good ol' days when we used to paint all these by hand? - Oh yeah. - Yeah. It took a long time, but goddamn it - We got it done! Yeah. Ok. You get some sleep, Phil! - He's gonna have a heart attack. - Guaranteed. - Hey, one more for the good guys. - Yeah. Yeah. What the hell? This is just like that dream I have. - Only I'm not on fire. - Hey Mike. Hey Lena. - What's the good word? - Restraining order. - That's two words. - Lena, what's going on here? Actually, that's what I need to talk to you both. You missed a house on your route. Hey, you know who you're talking to? We never miss a house. Easy. That can't be right. As he said, we never miss a house. You sure, you got the Sulsky house? Because the computer shows... Oh, fucking computer! It's probably got worms. The Sulsky house was the last house on our route. We got that one. OK. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll... write out the report personally and I'll e-mail it to you right away. Perfect. You know what, actually my office inbox gets really packed. So, I'll just give you my personal address. Sure. That would be great. Oh. Great. Putting it in my basket. - So, I'll see you at the party tonight? - Oh yeah. We will be there. Great. Dude, that was great. You seen that look she gave you? When you put her on the place. "My inbox gets packed." She loves it. She's a dirty, dirty girl. You ask her out. Alright? Dry spell over, Mikey. Ask her out. I'll see you in the locker room. What look? What look?! Yeah. I got a look. That was definitely a look. Hey Lena. Oh, okay Umm... I know, you can't love someone, 'till you learn to love yourself first. But I just wanna let you know, that I am... Im working on that. It's going good. Anyways, I was wondering, maybe if, sometime... When, you know, when you have some free time. You know, no pressure. Maybe... You'd like to get together, outside of the workplace environment. Oh yeah. - Hey Mikey. - Hi. Roulette tables are not perfect, right? You've got like a number one and number four is gonna hit every single time. OK. One more. One more. Okay. Take it. Take it. Take it. Hey. - How's the knee, Chunky? - It's fine. I heard about that stunt you pulled today. What you guys are retarted? And I can say "retarted." Cause I got a retarted brother. So I can say "retarted." - That was a computer glitch. - Come on. You guys are an embarrassement. You embarrass the company. You embarrass Liam and you embarrass me. You know Mike, steroids have a wide array of devastating side effects. You know that? Yeah. Jaundice, fluid retention, severe back acne or bacne.

She tore you in asshole, huh? Again! Shut up. Hey, fuck you, Luiz! - Culo! - Next. Sit down. Fuck you. Culo. Close the door. You're creating a draft. There you go. Beautiful. You asked to see us, sir? I love nudes. Do you know why I love nudes? 'Cause there ain't no boobs on a bowl of fruit. It's misogyny like that, which keeps women from Fully blooming in this world. That's why you was excommunicated from the Mormon Church, sir. Thank you, darling. - Sit down, boys. - Excuse me. Well... I've been looking over your files. Mike: Top Bunny 17 years in a row. Yeah. Volunteer work. Warmer! Warmer! You found it! Yay! Tore up your knee in Bosnia. And most notably: Recipient of the golden egg for outstanding performance. Impressive, Mike. Very impressive. Hank, your file is a little more... colorful. - What the fuck is that? - Hmmm? How many times, have you been on probation? - Once? - Twenty four. Is it twenty four? Feels like less. Stealing office supplies. Fighting with fellow employees. You've got it in backwards in the feeder. You've got to twist it around a little bit... Sexual harassment. Yes. Colorful. What happened? Sir? With what? You know what. This morning, six year old Lucy Sulsky, Was shocked and heart-broken not to find any Easter eggs. Did I do something to make the Easter bunny mad? Is there anything you'd like to say to the Easter bunny? Where's my fucking chocolate? There has been a national outcry for the misery, that befell little Lucy Sulsky. Early child trauma has severe damaging effects, and... over the next five hours... No Child Left Behind. You remember? Anyone near retirement, new on the job, or facing disciplinary problems: Will be downsized. - What? - Wait a second. You can't fire an Easter bunny. I mean...

We're fucking jokes, Mike. Fucking jokes. You know Easter just used us... and spit us out. Easter was our pimp. We were Easter bitches. Hey. Hey. Who am I? Hey. Who am I? Heyyy! Pretty lady! We are going for now to cut the company cake. I'm just messing... We were drinking with these Russian dudes. "Na zdorovye!" Come on, seriously. They want us back there. Let's go. Wow. I said... the company cake. It's double fudge delight. Fuck you! I've never done it with an Easter bunny before. Oh yeah? Well, this'll be the best 8.5 seconds of your life. Oh God. Major Hank. Ten, nine, eight... Seven, six, five, four, three, two... - Oh. - Yeah. Good morning. Got any jerky? Umm... No. - I was just on my way out. - Oh. - Nice to meet you. - You too. Oh. Good luck in space! What's that Watermelon Man? Oh, that's absurd. You're my BFF... Best Friend Forever. First of, kudos on reducing the delivery work force as per our discussion. Now that that's dealt with, I've got another great idea. As it stands the company's biggest expenditure is chocolate. You're wasting your time. That's what they said about my little Sponsored Suicide idea. We all saw how that turned out, didn't we? Yes. We did. Now, it's been nice chatting with you, but I have somewhere more important to be. And a lot of these bunnies, they're just coasting by and not doing their jobs, and they were acting all retarted. No. It's ok. I got a retarted brother. Look. You play with fire - You get cut. Hey. Where have you been? Hey. Nowhere. What'd you do all day? Nothing. I went to the store and got some stuff. Paper towels, pudding. What? I tell you everything I do now? You got pudding? - I went to the office. - Oh, motherfucker! What? You get down on your bum knee and beg for your job back? I'm sorry. "I'm sorry." "I'm sorry." Here, I'll give you sorry. Here's sorry. Come on, fatass. Come on. Fool. - You're crazy. - Come on! - You... - Want crazy, huh? Come on. No. - Don't... - Get off. OK. How come we never hug? What? How come we never hug? Hi. I'll have an extra grande moccha latte with raspberry and banana shots. Skim milk, no foam and four of these almond & white pepper biscottis, please. And for you sir? - Coffee. - Tall, grande or robust? I will fight you. Well. I could donate my body to science. Let them test shampoos and makeups on me. That'd be loads of fun. Hey. I can get that race track job, you know? Let them shove a stick up my ass and have dogs chase me round and round. Listen, there's still hope. We've just gotta tighten our belts a little. Cut down on the non-essentials, ok? - Go. - No more eating out. - You'll have to cut down on cigarettes. - Nope. - No more Pilates classes for me. - You did Pilates? We'd have to cut the cable and internet. Dude, we don't pay for that. I stole Leon's dish. No more deep tissue massages. No, no. Wait. No, no. - Those are partially coverd. - Were partially covered... - You'll have to drink domestic beer. - Nope. - I'll have to eat domestic ice cream. - There you go. And... Non-organic carrots. So listen, Mike. I didn't wanna bring it up earlier, but... Your golden egg, man. No. Dude, it's worth a ton, we could get like six months rent for that. No. Alright. Good. We tighten our belts. We're gonna be fine. For quite some time. Here we go. - Yeah. That's a good one. - Yeah. Good one. They're all good. All these will get you high. And what's that? What's that there? - Yeah. That makes grilled cheese. - Grilled cheese. Take five for it? - Makes waffles, too. - Anything. - Five? - Five bucks. Thanks. Alright. - Thanks guys. - Thanks Ralphie. Next. Next. Next. You really think they got something for us? Yeah. Mike, come on. Stay positive. Alright? Look, we're... We are smart, We're good-looking... We'll find a new job. No problem. I don't know. Who's gonna... Who's gonna hire an ex-Easter bunny with a bum knee, and no computer skills, Hank? - You need computer skills. - Next. - I've got a complaint. - What's your complaint? I hate my life. Yeah, well... Get in line. I am in line. Number 722. Number 722. That's me. Wish me luck. Wait. Wait. Hold up. I thought, we talked about this... We were gonna go in together... Yeah, but look. That's not how it works. You'll be fine. - Name? - Hank. Former occupation? I defused landmines. Chew-chew. I'm good. Oooh. I would... Love a Chew-Chew. - Fat. - Hank! What was the reason for your termination? We got fucked in the ass. Oh. Your files say: Downsizing. Yeah. It's a synonymn. Lady, our asses are broke. OK? So, we just really need a job. But it's... It's got to be together. Because... - We work better as a team. - Like Tonto and Lone Ranger. Do you have any special skills? I make marshmallows really well. On the fire. Campfire. It's not a skill, though. I'm a semi-professional break dancer. I've got my own cardboard. - So, that's lots of skills. - Yeah. - You've got plenty to put in your files. - And delivery. Well now you... That is so much more than just delivery. We provide wonder and magic... to children. But we deliver it. So, it's still delivery. We deliver wonder. And the way we do that is umm... We're a conduit for joy. Computer skills? I can do some Excel spreadsheet. - There's got to be something... - No. But not just anything. Alright? Look: No buying, no selling, no math, no heavy lifting. No skinning rabbits, no shit, no talking to people. - No... - No, no, no. And no shit. I... had a powerful jet of excrements scratch my cornea. Sorry. Kids. Kids! Look. We got a special visitor today. It's Easter bunny! Yay. Wow. Some reason, this guy has made it personal. Like it's my fault, that his sister likes to sleep in the nude and I have a Polaroid camera. Hey, it's not like there was a trespassing sign. But the next year, - the dip shit lays out a bear trap, OK? - Oopsie! No, no, we don't... No, this is a good one. This is a good one. A bear trap. You believe the balls on this guy, huh? Alright. Who knows what a bear trap is? Yeah. It's these big giant metal teeth. They lay them down on the ground and cover 'em with leafs. And it's just waiting there for you. You know what I mean? You're walking, doing your job, trying to making an honest living. And these things are just there. You step over them and CRUSH! Take off your leg. - Did you get away? - Shit yeah. Listen. I've got full medical, but there is no way... That I'm letting some sister fucking good ol' boy make an amputee out of me. No fucking way. So I went over to his house the next year. - And I took a giant bamboo... - Yay. Lunchtime everybody! - So let's thank Hank. - That's a true story, by the way. - Yeah. - Know what I mean? Hey! No. No. No. Someone farted. Come on. OK, kids. You're gonna love today's lunch. We got chocolate burgers, chocolate dogs, chocolate tacos with chocolate sauce. Fajita con chocolate. And for dessert... Chocolate! Chocolate pasta? Nice. - Hey. - Hey. Hey, lunchlady. Hey, this job ain't so bad. I was talking to these kids in class. And now... What the...? Oh, it's on, motherfuckers. This time it's chocolate. Should've seen the other guy. You ever see "Apocalypse Now?" - Oh yeah. - Yeah? Yeah. You ever see "The making of Apocalypse Now?" - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah? Yeah. Good. So, we understand each other. Every Easter you give away billions of chocolate eggs. Your company doesn't benefit from this at all. In fact all you're doing is getting kids hooked on chocolate. Who then pay somebody else good money to acquire more said chocolate. You can't justify this expense. I have come up with a sure-fire way to not only cut costs, but also turn a phenominal profit. These fourteen times less expensive than traditional chocolate eggs have an infinite shelf life and are lighter. And here is the best part: We advertise on the surface of the egg. Think about it. We deliver to every household in the world. Companies will be lining up, stepping over each other to pay through the tooth for us to advertise their product on our eggs. - Hubriss... - In the first year alone, your profits... - Hubriss... - Yes? I can't go with you looking. In the first year alone, your profits will raise 3.421 percent. It's all in my report that I'll be delivering to the Board of Trustees, at next month's meeting. This company has been around a long time. Wonder. Magic. A child smiling from ear to ear. These were once the life-blood of this company. Now when I see what I've allowed to happen. It disgusts me. You disgust me. Do you even know what magic is, Conrad? This company will do exactly as my report suggests. Well. Last time I checked, Sparky, I still ran this company. Not when the board votes with me. Sparky. It won't pass, dude. That's... That's... - That's just too much. - Stop being fat. I'll stop smoking. - And there's the cherry. - Yeah. That's just great. That's great. Now, we're gonna be homeless. Great. We're gonna travel the country in boxcars and get into just... splendid adventures. Oh. It's my dream come true. Now we... we got to get a lovable mutt named Scruffy And, and... We got to learn to play the harmonica. And eat lots and lots of baked beans! Hey. Good night. Shut up. Shut up. You motherfucking, cock sucking, backstabbing asshole! - Mike, listen. - I want my egg back. I don't care what you did with it or what you have to do to get it back. I want my egg back. - Mike, Mike. - Please, get my egg back. What for, man? It's just a reminder of how they fucked you. No they didn't fuck me. You fucked me! Mike... I know you are upset, man. They fired you for no reason. No, they didn't fire me because of no reason. They fired me... 'Cause of what, huh? Because of me? Huh? Come on. Come on. Say it. Come on. Say it. Come on. Say it, fuckface. Huh? What you wanna do? What you wanna do, huh? Come on. You wanna hit me? Yeah? Yeah. You wanna punch me? Come on. Come on. Punch me. Come on, Mike. Punch me. Huh? Come on, huh! Punch me, huh! You like that? Feel good. Oh yeah. It feels good to stand up for yourself, doesn't it? If anything... I did you a fucking favor. A favor? Your little favor cost me the only thing I had. The only thing I had. In my miserable fucking, goddamn, fucking life! It's my fault your life is miserable? If it wasn't for me, your life would be shit. You would fucking sit in there and stuff your fat face 'till you fucking blew up. Listen man, I give that company as many years as you did. The difference is, when I get shat on: I don't put on a raincoat and say "thank you". Are you Easter bunny? No. You want some soup. Who are you? We're Team Jesus. Here you go. Nice warm soup. It's gonna feel really good, going down. The merciful burning light of Jesus. - Praise Jesus. - Praise Jesus. Don't worry. We're just here to help. Little warm soup. Nice blanket. And the merciful burning light of our Lord and savior. - Praise Lord Jesus. - Praise Lord Jesus. No, no... Fear not Pagan. Cause your soul... Can still be cleansed. You gotta let me in. You gotta let me in. Just let go... Just... Gotta let me in. Wait. You'll.. You'll burn in hell, infidel. You'll burn in hell. Get back in the van. I pushed too hard, too fast. There's your fucking chocolate. What's up? Mike? Hey, Lena. - How you doing? - Oh, good. Good. Just... stretching it out. I haven't seen you since the party. What have you been up to? Oh. You know. Stuff. Yeah. On the burner. Yeah. Freelance, portfolios, expanding, assist, you know. - The usual. - Yeah. Mike, let's have a coffee. - You can lay eggs? - Me? No. No. - What about you? - What about me? I don't know. Tell me something I don't know. - Like what? - Anything. Well, Easter always reminds me of my grandmother. And she was Ukrainian. She would always paint these amazingly beautiful eggs. They're called pysankies. - Yeah. I know. - Oh yeah. Of course. And every year when we went over to her house for Easter dinner... She would hide one of them for me. And I never saw her do it. You know, she was old. - She moved really slowly, - It's tricky. But I never saw her do it! But at the end of the night, when we're getting ready to leave. I'd put on my coat, put my hand into my pocket and there it was. This, gorgeous gift. She would always tell me that the Easter bunny had put it there. Looked forward to getting that egg every year. Just made me happy, you know. She died six days before Easter. On Easter morning, when I put my hand into my pocket... I half expected my fingers to find it there. Isn't that silly? No. No. It's not silly at all. It's really sweet. - You're sweet. - Thank you. This is one extremely cold spring and it looks it will stay that way at least until the weekend. We have two low pressure systems converging over the city, that result in high winds overnight and possibly snowballs tomorrow Thursday, the risk of freezing rain and Friday overcast and cold... So, hope you're enjoying the clear weather and sun... - Oh. - Hey, Hank. Got any aspirine? - What the fuck happened to you? - I tried it. Tried what? Sponsored Suicide. - Why the fuck would you do that? - 'Cause I'm a loser. I got fired from my job and gambled away our life savings. My wife left me. I offered Mike ten bucks to eat out of his asshole. Yeah, that was weird. - Well, looks like you're still breathing. - That's the problem. I screwed up. How can you screw killing yourself? Sometimes, you just don't die. I'm gonna ask for another chance, you know. I'm gonna beg. Beg 'm for another chance 'cause I know I can do this, you know. Why? Sometimes you just get in the way. I'm just tired of being in the way. Just wanna get out of the way. I've learned the most important thing in life is to love someone. God, I hated her. Once she left, I realised I didn't hate her. I hate me. I hate me, Hank. I hate me so much. I hate you too, Leon. Thanks, Hank. Hold on. This was fun, Mike. I really had a good time. Is everything ok? I'm secretly in love with you. No, I've been secretly in love with you since the first time I saw you and... I wanted to tell you so many times, but... But I was a coward. Even came by here a few times, but... Never mustered up the courage to actually tell you so. I've been watching you. Outside your window for a long time now. Yeah. You walked across your bedroom to your bed and take out your change and receipts from your pockets. And you put them in the little blue ashtray on your night table. God knows why you have an ashtray. You don't even smoke. You take your clothes off. And I wanna look away. But I can't. You were so beautiful. And I watch you. Till you fall asleep. I wonder what it would feel like to be lying there next to you. Hey, Mikey. How you doing? Whiskey. Leave the bottle. Oh Mikey. Come on, man. It's been three years. How about I get you a nice steak and a face dance? I need to get so drunk I forget I exist. Jesus Christ, Mikey! It can't be that bad, can it? Just bring the bottle. Oh yeah, OK. Fuck, I'll bring you the fucking bottle. Alright. Here. Here's the fucking bottle. Love. I fell in love once. And give up everything for it. My desire my ambition to make a mark on this world. - I don't deserve to be loved. - That's the problem right there. It feels like the world owes 'em something. Can't count on anything, anymore.
