The Universe. Vast. Ancient. Luminous with billions of galaxies. Within each galaxy, millions of civilizations. Most are long gone, wiped out by supernova, volcanic eruption, and, as is all too common, self-inflicted extinction. There is, however, one civilization that has endured, blossomed. It is nested on a modest, blue world, orbiting a modest, yellow star. Yet, this world's future is now in danger. All because one young citizen is about to unravel the very fabric of the universe. - I'm telling you, Dan, a steelhead this big! Woah! I named her Helga. You do know you're talking on the radio, right? - Yes? Oops. Hold on, Dan. Yes? Attention, aircraft heading 2, 5, 9, mark 8. Evacuate airspace immediately. You have traffic at 9 o'clock. - 9 o'clock? Huh, 12, 11, 10, 9... So, if you're holding your arms out to show me how big the fish is, I can't actually see it. - I'm going to have to call you back, Dan. Sir, I urge to evacuate! Traffic at 12 o'clock, less than 6,000 feet. What the? That's one fast son of a gun. Sir, evacuate now! I repeat, evacuate now! - Hang on to your fins, Helga! Sir, what is your situation? - I'm upset! What is your vehicle situation? - Oh, I'm, I'm stalled! What the heck was that? Don't panic, Helga! Don't panic, Helga! Panic Helga! Lovely morning, Tom. Perhaps we should picnic here. We can't stop here, it's pterodactyl country. Are we dead? I don't feel dead. We made it! But we're lost! And my phone is ruined! Mom, dad! Pumpkin! Mom, stop calling me pumpkin! My name is... Jason? Jason? - Coming! Geez. Where's the giant meatball? - Shape and size don't have taste. - You don't have taste. - Hey, you be nice! First, the latest on a downed aircraft. A small, one-engine airplane that allegedly... - Don't forget to take out the trash. - Yes, Brett. - Uncle Brett. But, so far, there's no evidence of fire. - Eat, eat. I can't afford to have you get sick. - This is going to make me sick. I think I saw it moving earlier. Are now expanding their search. Delicious. - Mmm. Just before 7pm eastern standard time. I didn't want this either. Last thing I wanted was my nephew to become my son. - Last thing I wanted was my uncle to become my dad. - So then, what? Juvie? The orphanage? - I'm not an orphan! - What happened, happened. Your parents, they're... - They're not gone! They just haven't been found. Yet. - Their car was. The search team... - The search teams gave up. Unusual aerial activity. The light, just another standard... - Wasn't that your mom's? - Yes. She was supposed to wear it that night. - You think it would have saved her? - Of course not. That would be superstitious. The pilot identified... - Woah! Glenn Howard Smith is now confirmed to have ejected safely. - So fake. - How do you know? - Considering modern humans have lived for only for a cosmological blink of an eye, the statistical likelihood of an advanced alien species living at the same time, then travelling hundreds, if not thousands of light years, to get here is about 0%. - Well, it's a good thing that nerds are cool, now. Was headed towards Wells Forest. - Hey, that's where camp is. - Oh, about that. - What? - I cancelled camp. - What? - Look, I don't have the same research grants that your parents did. - Parents do. - It's not sustainable. Camp, the house, giant meatballs. - House? - We're moving to my condo downtown. - You can't do this. - I already did. I'm sorry. Jason. Jason! - I'm going to find you. - Think you have enough supplies to make it to the curb and back? Where are you going? - To take out the garbage? - Jason. - I'm going to find mom and dad. - State Emergency Service checked for weeks. - I don't trust the State Emergency Services. - Then who do you trust? Look. If it means that much, I'll take you. You don't trust me either. Take out the trash. Come back. And we'll talk, OK? If you're not back in two minutes, I'm cooking again tomorrow. - Mom? Dad? Mom? Dad? The pilot! Can't be. No! Alien! How do I close that door? Closing the door. - Careful! - I think you just... - Are you the pilot? - What? No! - How did you... - I snuck in too. - It's going to find a way in. Don't you have like mace or something? - Mace? - Or garlic? No, that's vampires. - Who are you? Confirmed time travel. - Confirmed time travel? - Wait! Time travel confirmed. - Stop program! Not possible. Timescape preset 275 initiated. Please be seated. - We're in a time machine? - What have you done? - We're in a time machine. Nice chairs. - I already don't like you. - I have that effect on people. Prepare for temporal displacement. I'm going to retch for a while. A natural reaction. - Please don't have a natural reaction. Allow me to provide visual context to help restore your ocular equilibrium. Oh, no way! This is... Lara, run! Now will you... We don't have the power to return to our time. The most significant time in history is the end of the cretaceous period. The impact of a 40 mile-wide asteroid. MIA, watch out! Allosaurus! What in the universe... It's more like finding... Where are they running to? Not running to, running from! Leave me alone. You can't do this by yourself! - The Gulf of Mexico? - Big Mountain. Getting bigger! - How do you control this thing? - With that! Pull up. - That's what I'm doing! - Well, do it better! - I've got this! Hey! - Whatever you got, it's not this! - Ow, you're squishing my hand! - Let go! - That hurts! - Despite your best efforts, we are still alive. - I loosened it up for you. - You're welcome. - No buildings. Caution, navigation power loss in five, four. - Engage autopilot. Autopilot engaged. - How did you know? - Lucky guess? - So, what's your name, anyways? - Lara. - Hi, Lara. I'm Jason, thanks for asking. - Not good. Stop it! Why did you have to activate the time program? - I did not. You did. - Who's side are you on? The side of objective fact. - I didn't do it. - Then who did? - Technically, my butt. - What is wrong with you? - Quite a few things, to be honest. I have observed 13 behavioural issues, so far. - Who are you? Oh, of course, where are my manners? Woah! - I'm your mobile intelligence assistant. MIA, for short. - So, aliens are real, and they're time travellers. Is that alien in the forest the captain of the ship? Why did he use that blue beam on me? How do you know English? What planet are you from? How do you speak... - I asked all that already! It only answers basic questions, like, "What's happening?" Isn't that right, MIA? - Correct. I can only reveal general information and observations on what is presently happening. - MIA. - Yes? - What's happening? - You are in a time machine, designed to observe but not interfere with significant historical events. - But you can't tell us who you are. - I told you, it can't. I cannot. Apologies. I'm sure I must have very good reasons. - What? - I think it's trying to make a joke. Aren't you, MIA? - Joke, a short anecdote to provoke laughter and amusement. Yes, I can recollect over 1,000 jokes from my human observations. Would you like to hear one now? - Yes! - No! - Which direction? - We have travelled backward through the timescape. - Timescape? - How far back? - About 65 million years. Give or take a few hundred thousand. - Mom is going to kill me. And then she's going to bring me back just so she can kill me again. - That's the age of the dinosaurs. The cretaceous. - Impressive paleontological knowledge. - This is amazing. - This is the opposite of amazing. - This is an opportunity of a lifetime. I'm going to meet a dinosaur. Feed a dinosaur. Ride a dinosaur. Let's go. What's with everyone blocking doors? - It's too dangerous. - Fine, I won't ride one. - No, it's too dangerous to go outside at all. - It'll be fine. I know everything about dinosaurs. MIA, open the... - Promise you won't ask to open the you-know-what. - Why? - Because. You'll change history. Isn't that right, MIA? - You cannot change history. - See, you'll change... Hey, whose side are you on? - The side of objective fact. - So, it's safe to go out? It is not. - But you just said... - History is unalterable, yes, but the future, your future is alterable, multiple. - Multiple? Is time like an object? - Time is an object with mass and shape. History is the solid part of the object. It is unchangeable. The future, however, is fluid. Like a cake that hasn't finished baking yet. So I can change the future? - Only the future you have not yet experienced. - That's deep. - Depth is the third dimension. We're discussing the fourth. - Nobody likes a smart-aleck know-it-all and... Oh, wait, I just describe myself. - Jason, take a breath. - We have to return the ship so that we don't change the future. My future. - You're not making any sense. - Will you trust me? - I just met you! And, honestly, you're kind of mean. - Trust me! MIA, return the ship. - I'm afraid that is not possible. The recent back-to-back tours through the timescape have drained the ship's power. We must first solar charge. - Great. How long? - Approximately two hours. - Enough time to go outside and look for a dinosaur. Just a small one. A non-bitey one? Fine. Just how do you time travel anyways? - By creating a temporal distortion field, while simultaneously compensating for spatial offset. - Makes sense. - You understood that? - Time travel obviously has to take into account solar orbit, galactic spiral rotation, universal expansion, etc. - Precisely. - Or else you can end up materializing inside a volcano or in outer space or worse, a DMV. - You may be the smartest idiot I've ever met. - Thank you? What are you looking for? A pack of brontosaurus? - Of course not. Brontosaurus aren't common in the Cretaceous era. - Well, just don't press any more buttons. You or your butt. - It was an accident, you know. Going back in time. - Really? - The door, it scared me. - The door? - It made a loud noise and... And... Are you... - Wow! - MIA? Yes, Lara? - When can you get us airborne? Airborne acceleration is unavailable. We must first solar charge. And then we must work on your listening skills, because I just explained this. - Brachiosaurus. I was right! - MIA, fly! Impossible. - Make it possible. Unfortunately my program cannot convert the impossible to the possible. - Sarcasm. Really? - Humour to lighten a grave situation. - This isn't a grave situation. Brachiosaurus are harmless. They're just walking. - Looks more like running to me. What are they running to? - Running to or running from? - MIA, stabilize! Gyroscopic stabilization initiated. - Gyro? Cool! How did you... - Don't move. - Does trembling in fear count as moving? - MIA, activate rear camera. - T... - Rex. - Cool! - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't come any closer. Your vocal emissions will not transmit through the ship's reinforced carbon nanotube superstructure to be audible outside. However I can activate external speakers. No! - Thank goodness. - Please remain seated until the vehicle has come to a complete stop. - Next time, we do things my way. - Why is your way any better? - It literally can't be worse. - Why should I trust you? You know nothing about dinosaurs. Nothing about this ship! - I do know some things about dinosaurs like, "Don't time travel to see them." And I know a lot about this ship. - How can you know more than me? - I was here first. - When did you... - You saw your dinosaurs and now we return to our time. - We don't have the power to return to our time. - So we wait here quietly and without touching anything until the ship is fully charged and we return to our time. You have a better idea? - Well, I was thinking... - What? - That we wait for the ship to fully charge and we get back to our time. - Brilliant plan. - Thank you. - We're getting way less sun down here. MIA, how much longer will it take to charge? Approximately one more day. - Things could be worse. - Things are worse. - MIA. - The craft has suffered a hull breach. We must survey the damage. - Outside? What about disrupting history? - We will cause much greater temporal disruption if we do not repair the vessel. - Looks like you got your wish. - MIA, tell me this is repairable. - It's repairable. I can fuse the rupture myself. - Good. Except... - No. No "excepts." No "howevers." - Here it comes. - Nonetheless, we need 10 lbs of refined silver ore to make the seal. - Can we use the silver that broke off? - Twice what was lost is required to bond the rupture. - You'd think this thing would have come with a patch kit. Or a AAA membership. - What? - You don't know what a patch... - MIA, why did you tell me you could repair it? - Because I can. Once we find 10 lbs of silver ore. - Any other bits of relevant information that we should know about the repairs? About the repair? No. - I thought you said you knew everything. Not without a wireless network to essential information servers. Well, what do you know? I know everything regarding the function of this ship. - You know something. Something important. Just... - 'Fess up? - What? - Silver rush. - Silver rush happened in the 1800s. - You know your history. - More than you know. - Used to vacation in the Gulf. Prospectors travelled here by the thousands. Mined every last ounce of silver. - You mean, "will mine." - Bingo. - Bin, what? - The 1800s won't happen for another 65 million years. - So, there should be plenty of silver around. - My vision can calibrate to detect imbedded silver ore within rock. - Been awhile since I used a pickaxe and dynamite. - You are not normal. - I am not. - Eureka. I've located enough silver at the peak bearing 325. - On that mountain? - Like a giant meatball on top of spaghetti. - I thought you had to mine for silver, underground. - Service mine, no digging needed. - I knew that. - I am doubtful you knew that. How far? - Half day, by human foot. - That's a long time to carry 10 lbs of silver. - I carry twice that in textbooks. - With those arms? - No. With this. - Right. - I recommend we begin this dangerous endeavour with little chance of success immediately. Follow me. So where are you from? Brooklyn. - Explains the outfit. - I'll take that as a compliment. - I was actually asking MIA. - I am not authorized to disclose such information. - What did the captain of the ship do to that pilot in the forest? - I am not authorized to disclose such information. - Is the captain an alien? - I am not authorized to disclose such information. - Are you an alien? - I am not authorized... Guys, please. I am not a "guy." I am genderless. - You are a glorified navigational system with serious mental problems. If I possessed emotions, that would've hurt. - Hey! - Shush. Did you hear that? - MIA, survey immediate area for anything else alive. - Narrow perimeters, please. - Huh, bipedal, non-human, hungry. Right away. Two prehistoric bipedal life forms identified. 1.5 metres tall. - Buitreraptor. - Please tell me they're vegetarian. - Carnivores. - Can we outrun them? - Buitreraptor can run up to 40 miles per hour. - What's that in metric? - I don't know! Scary fast? - 65 kilometres per hour. - So, if we run, they get us, If we stay, they get us. MIA. Options. - I have identified a lake 350 metres due North East. - Can we make it to the lake before those things do? - Calculating. We have a 50% chance of success. - I don't like those odds. Run! - Where's the other one? 12 o'clock! - What's 12 o'clock? - Three, two, one. 12 o'clock! On my mark, we run to 3 o'clock. - What's your mark? Mark! - Why are they slowing down? - Because they 100% can't swim. - MIA, tell me you have something up your sleeve. - I have no sleeve but, if you'd like, I can convert it to a submersible vehicle. - What? Yes! Convert, convert! - Woah. - Woah. - This is tight. - On the contrary. The vacuum sealed plasma shield is intentionally loose to accommodate up to four passengers. - Why didn't you make this bubble thing when they first started chasing us? - The plasma shield can only sustain structural integrity under water. Tylosaurus! - MIA, do something! - Right away. - MIA, watch out! - Side fact to this: armless. - Prepare for resurfacing. - How do you prepare for that? - It's more mental preparation. - Wow. Wow. That was epic. Let's do it again! - We have to keep moving. Also, you're insane. Come on! - When were you going to tell me? - Tell you what? - That you're not who you say you are. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Spill the beans. - I'm not carrying beans. - Ah ha! Third time you don't know basic 21st-century slang. Lara? You can tell me. - Why? So you can trust me even less? - I snuck on to that ship. - I know. - No, you don't know. I snuck on to that ship at a different time. - Yes, right before me. - After you. - Huh, say again? - That ship, it came from the future. My future. 2520 A.D. - So that makes it... - 500 years after your time. That's when I snuck in. I stowed away. And then the ship went back in time to you. - Wow. OK, so just drop me off into my time and then you continue to yours. Easy peasy. - What's a peasy? - Nevermind. - It's not that simple. Once we get back to your time, we have to return the ship to the pilot. - Oh, the alien. Big head, almond eyes. Definitely an alien. We've messed with the Timescape enough. We return the ship to the pilot in your time. - What happens to you? - I don't know. Pretty sure there will be a lot of yelling. - You have family in the year 2520? - My mom. - I had two parents. - Had? - Car accident. - Oh, I'm, I'm sorry. - Enough spilled beans. - Careful! - Woah. - What is it? - Probably some avian? - How do you not know? - Only a fraction of all dinosaurs have been discovered. - So, this is... - Something new. Pardon me, but we are on a tight schedule. So what's the future like? Are there flying cars? Did you colonize Mars? Did you invent unlimited energy? Did you cure all diseases? - I shouldn't say anything else about my future. - Why not? - Because if I do, my future could be destroyed. - Oh, I keep forgetting that. - We have to get to the top of that? - I anticipate that we will need to scout for shelter as it will take longer to ascend to destination than previously estimated. - Define longer. Factoring estimated distance, angle of grade, the diminishing frequency of your walking rhythms, and the fact that you are about to be chewed on... - Jason! - What is wrong with you? - Not wrong! Very right! - MIA, do something! - Please discontinue your effort to consume this human child. - Plants don't understand English! - I'm not a child! - Lara, run! Run! Pizza! Pizza, he smells pizza! I grab a slice on the way home every day, Brett's cooking sucks. You're telling me you don't know what pizza is? - No! - That's the saddest thing I've ever heard. - Let's discuss this somewhere else. This will provide adequate shelter to assist in entering a state of extended unconsciousness while your biological mechanisms repair themselves. - Sleep. - I know what sleep is. - You don't know what pizza is. - Pizza isn't essential to survival. - I beg to differ. Huh, hey. Thanks for saving my life back there. - That's what friends do. - Friends? - It's going to get cold. - I'll take care of that. - Really? - What are you doing? - You'll see. I was a boy scout for nearly an hour. Some problems don't need high-tech solutions. - You don't say. - Just another second. I warmed it up for you. - What is that, anyway? - Oh. It's my mom's good luck charm. - You believe in luck. - I believe in her. - You miss them. - My parents? Of course. - What were they like? - Well, they were nice, really smart. Both scientists, actually. They do everything together. Renovations, laundry, cooking. - Cooking? Like pizza? - Even better than pizza. Spaghetti and a meatball. It's like this perfect al dente pasta with a giant meatball on top. The size of a soft ball. - That actually sounds pretty good. - They were always there for me. No matter what. - You trusted them. - Of course. - But no one else. - They never let me down. - Present tense. - What? - Well, you speak of your parents in the present tense, as though they're still alive. But weren't they in a car accident? - They found the car, not them. - Looks like you still haven't accepted what happened, accepted history. - We're going to find them. Save them! I mean, I was looking for them in the forest when I ran into you. What about your mom? - Well, she travels a lot, so I'm alone a lot. - That sucks. - I know she loves me. And I love her. But her job, it really keeps us apart. - You need to get back to her. - I will. - How are you so sure? - Because I have trust. - In what? - People, fate, the universe. - The universe. Hate to break it to you, but the universe doesn't care about life on Earth. I mean, it caused the dinosaurs to go extinct. - I know. Still I trust it will be OK. - The only thing I trust is myself. - Sounds so lonely. - Here. Sit up. For luck. - I can't accept this. - You need it more than me. - Thank you. - Meteorites are out tonight? - No! - What in the universe's name... MIA! - You're up early! - Why didn't you tell us about... About... - The swarm of carnivorous avian insects? - Yes! I surmised it was more important to allow you to get a full night's sleep. - You surmised wrong! Well, you both look much more refreshed. - What do we do? Have you lost your mind? He's lost his mind. - I was unaware humans can misplace one's mind. - I can't always run from my problems. - You can run from this one though. I won't tell. - It worked? - It worked! That was genius. Hey. Not bad what you did back there. - It's what friends do. MIA? What's the date? - 65 million 274,000 BC. - Oh, no. - What is it? - The ship, it was programmed to witness significant times in history, right? - Yes, and? - Well, the significant time in history is the end of the cretaceous period. - The cretaceous ended with... - The impact of a 40 mile-wide asteroid. - MIA! - Yes, Lara? Why didn't you tell us we were about to get flattened by a giant rock? - Because you ordered me not to reveal information regarding our mission. - What mission? - I don't know what MIA is talking about. So crazy. Do you not remember, Lara, when Jason was moments from boarding the Odyssey, you ordered me to protect the identity of the mission. - MIA! - The Odyssey? Is that the name of the ship? You two knew each other before? You lied! - Jason, I can explain. - Then explain. - I can't. - I'm getting some pretty mixed messages here. - Jason, you don't understand. - I understand very well. I understand not to trust you. MIA, how much time do we have? - Impact will occur in approximately 52 minutes. Would you like me to set a reminder 10 minutes before? - You do realize we have no time to mine the silver and get it back to the ship, right? - I can summon the craft, the battery has accumulated enough solar charge and is now operational. - Why didn't you tell us this before? - It wasn't relevant before. - MIA, summon the ship to the top of the mountain. - Done. - Goodbye. - Jason, please. - Leave me alone. - You can't do this by yourself! - The direction he is taking will add 12 minutes to the destination. - This isn't happening. - And he is about to trip on a root. I meant to do that. - Lara, we must hurry. Please. This way. - Where is it? - There. - There's 10 lbs of silver in that rock? - Triple that. - Well, how do we extract the silver and graft it on to the ship? - Leave that to me. - Really, he's just going to wait there? - That's right. - So we just wait here for the ship? - Unnecessary. - Why? - Because it is here. - Oh! - The asteroid. - MIA, let's fix the ship and get the heck out of here. - Excellent idea. - How much time to repair? - Two minutes. - How much time until asteroid impact? - Three minutes. - Cutting it a bit close, aren't we? - As long as nothing unexpected happens. - Jason! - What are you doing? - Saving your life, dummy. - Oh. - MIA, open door. - What? - Trust me. - For the last time, I do not trust you. - Now! - Repair complete. MIA, close door! Power on! - Programming the time travel... - Sit! Mia, execute time program 275B. - Yes, Lara. - How did you know? - Wrong way! Optimal trajectory determined by time travel program. - That does not look optimal to me! - We need to get out of the way. - You think? - Tell me what's going on. - Kind of busy right now. - That's it, I'm taking control. - No! Will you trust me? Trust me! Grab the controller - But you just said... - With me! Push! - But we need to pull! - Push! Now pull! - Now that was epic. Prepare for temporal displacement. Are we back? - We're back. - You didn't sneak on to this ship. This is your ship. You're the time traveller. Why didn't you tell me? - It's complicated. - I just punched a dragonfly the size of a horse and I'll punch you too. - It's OK. - Lara? - Wait. - What in the world are you doing on my ship? - She's your... - Hi mom. - Who's this? - I'm Jason. - Well, that clears it up. MIA, restore English glyphs. Right away, captain. - Security feature. - None of this is alien. - Cloaking device is still down. Still offline, yes, my apologies. I was distracted by... - Time travel, hull fracture... A daughter who is about to be grounded. You're both time travellers. - Lara! You know full well it's forbidden to reveal your identity. - I didn't! - She didn't say anything! I figured it out, all on my own. I'm the smartest idiot you'll ever meet. The boy child is correct. He is unusually intelligent when not being foolish, stubborn and irrational. - Thanks. - I'm sorry I didn't tell you. - It was me who sent us back in time. - You? - Yes, well. Actually though, it was my butt. - I will make sure to disinfect the control panel. - It was an accident, she did nothing wrong. - You snuck on board. That is a Class J timescape infraction. For both of you. - She snuck on board because you're never around. - Excuse me? - Jason, please don't. - I had a mother, father, family. Had. You're all Lara has. And you're never around. - I have important historical surveying to do. - More important than your own daughter? - Time travel is no place for a child. - I'm not a child! - It's dangerous! - What's dangerous is not being there for your kid. And then before you know, one of you is gone. You're a time traveller who has no time for her daughter. - Good one. - Is that why you snuck on board? - Mom, I never see you. I just wanted to, I don't know, miss you, us. And then things got all complicated, because of him. - What happened to... - My parents? Car slid off a mountain. - Oh. - Their car was found. But not them. - How long? - Two weeks ago. Two weeks. They're gone now and I have to move on. - I'm sorry, Jason. - It's not too late for you. Be there for Lara. - Well, it looks like we have some time to make up. You're a good kid, Jason. I'm sorry you won't remember this. - Wait. - I'm going to have to erase your memory. - You're kidding! - No, not that thing again. - Don't worry. It's harmless. Just a short term memory wipe. All interactions from this ship. MIA, Lara, myself. They'll be erased. - Why? - We can't have you knowing the future. - I'll forget you? - I'll remember. For the both of us. - You make a beautiful family. Since I won't remember any of this... - What? - Tell me what the future is like. - Jason! - I'm serious! Please? - The future. Well, we have unlimited energy, no diseases, no money. But, most important of all, every person is free to pursue their most basic human rights. To realize their full potential. - So, everything turns out OK? - Everything turns out OK. - That's why we can't have you knowing the future. We don't want it changed. Understand? You're ready? If you don't trust me, we can have MIA perform the wipe. - No, that's OK. I... I... Trust you. - Hold still. - How did I get here? - How did I get here? Hey! Hey! Did you see Helga? She's about this big. - Brett? What's going on? - Pumpkin! - Mom! Dad! - Oh, we missed you so much. - How, I thought... - Easy now, little man, they've been stranded in the wilderness for two weeks. - It's OK. We were thrown from the car. We hiked to find shelter. Before the cold set in. - We were stranded. We didn't know if we'd make it back. - I know the feeling. - Two weeks, thinking we were gone. Oh, that must have been awful. - We are so sorry. - I'll forgive you on one condition. Stop calling me pumpkin! - Great, guess I'm off the hook. You think I could hitch a ride with you downtown? - Yes sure, but we might have to arrest you along the way. - For what? - I think assault. - Delicious. What the what? I was supposed to have that. She forgot it. - I know. - Vivian? - You're right. I didn't have it. I can't explain it. But it was given back to me when we drove off the mountain. - Are you OK, honey? - It was like a dream. Someone appeared as we fell, a girl, her name was Laura? - Lara? - Yes! Lara, how did you know? - I don't know. Did she say anything else? - Just, "Trust me." - Well. The important thing is that we're together. - A family. - You realized you changed history by saving his parents. - Well, according to timescape theory, we were destined to save them. - So what's the next stop, Lara? I mean, lieutenant-commander Lara? - Triassic Era. - Oh, dinosaurs. Again. - A good friend got me into them. - Well, you're the expert. MIA, confirm time travel. - Time travel confirmed. - Good thing we didn't panic and drive off the cliff. - Jason! We need your help. - Woah. Shush. You must not allow anyone to see me as it would disrupt the timescape. - Who, what are you? - Oh, my manners! The memory wipe. Hold still. - What are you going to do to me? Please don't say, "Precious fluids." - Do not worry, it is just a simple memory restore. Perfectly harmless. - So, this isn't the end? - Quite the contrary. This is just the beginning. Where is it? There! Careful! Subtitles: Studio Sonogram
