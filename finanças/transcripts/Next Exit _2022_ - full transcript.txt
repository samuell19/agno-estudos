Reo. You scared me. Did you get what I asked for? Yeah. Hey, Dad. I'm gonna beat you. I'm gonna beat you at this game. All right. We'll see. The number of homicides and suicides continues to climb since the release of the groundbreaking footage of Reo Nakata playing cards with his dead father. Dr. Stevensen of the Life Beyond Institute is live now to address Congress's motion to shut her study down. Let's take a listen. It is irrefutable. Our consciousness continues beyond our physical bodies. Death is merely a transition to another existence... ...one we can now see... ...track and record due to the findings of my Life Beyond research. At our institute, we now bridge dozens of new participants daily from this world to the next, which has led to astounding breakthroughs. Soon, we will be able to comprehend what was previously the great unknown. With countless possibilities ahead of us, it is imperative we continue this research. Much like many explorers before us, we have seen our world expand. It is now our duty to discover how far. Contrary to recent news, my Life Beyond study, like all proper research programs, is strictly a volunteer program. It is a clinical, not criminal enterprise. Congress is attempting to shut us down, but their efforts only show how much they fundamentally misunderstand the facts of our new reality... Hey, it's Chad. I'm here for the TV. You got the cash? It works, right? Yeah. What do you have to say about the shootings taking place? Everyone needs to calm down. Congress will sort out the legislation - but in the meantime... - All yours. ...people are adding to the chaos, all right? We really need to know more before any decision. Hello? Hello! This is James from Dr. Stevensen's Life Beyond study. Can you please confirm your password? Uh. Yeah. It's, uh, 35 capital FML. Just checking to confirm, you declined your flight to San Francisco - and requested a car? - Yeah. They told me that would be okay. Of course. I'm sending your car rental information now. Pick-up is noon today. I'll be there. Everything is in order. Have your confirmation QR code when you arrive - and we'll see you soon. - Okay, thanks. Bye. So, are you one of those people? That must be exciting to... just let it all go. I respect that. Can I do anything else for you before you go? Let me help you with the TV. Hey, I can get that. Hey. Hey! Whoa, hey! Give me back my money! Just give me the fucking money. I'm gonna keep standing out here. Hello? You crazy bitch! No, I got it. Noon pick-up. I'll be there. Great. Thank you. Fuck yeah, Stanley! Hey, I'm going to San Francisco. What? You're one of them?? That's right. We're here live in San Francisco. Crowds have gathered just outside Dr. Stevensen. I'm just eating breakfast. Come in. Come in. The next round... What the hell's the dog doing here? And they're coming out now. They're taking their positions. This is very exciting. Here's Dr. Stevensen herself. Killing themselves over this bull bunk. They say robberies are down because the robbers can't get people to do what they want anymore. Like dying isn't dying. Well, it's... it's been proven, Milton. It's science now. But science is supposed to make ya smarter, not dumber. Hey, look, Milton, um... I've got to go. I've got somewhere to be. What? I put you on the team for today. You said you wanted this gig. You can't do this. I'm here for Stanley. I'm... I'm leaving him to you. We're so excited to be here to help see and support our brave new participants. Let's give them a round of applause. Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's not the fucking Oscars, kid. There's nothing to celebrate. I'm going to San Francisco. Teddy... I'm not asking for permission. Teddy, you're... you're young yet. You don't know how much you have to look forward to. Come on. We both know that's not true. I mean, did... did you see that Niko guy on TV? I saw a bunch of people. Every station, every newspaper. Like him. Like me. I mean, I'm on that list. This way... this way, I... I finally have a shot at something. You can't really think that. You're gonna need some of this for Stanley, all right? So this is supposed to be goodbye? No. No. I'll... I'll come back and haunt you. Okay, listen, they made me the reservation. I don't understand why I have to put a credit card down - if it's already paid for. - I'm sorry. - But it's company policy. - Right. If you'd like, I will call corporate - and triple-check. - Please. Do it. Hello! I can help you over here, sir. Hey. Uh, yeah. I have a car reserved for me - for a noon pick-up. - Great. I just need your credit card and driver's license. Yeah. Ah... Here you go. Perfect. Thank you. Oh, I'm sorry, sir. This expires in a week. I won't be needing it past then. You'll need a valid driver's license that doesn't expire for two months in order to rent a car. That makes no sense. It's valid for when I need it. Just so you know, Blossom... Rose. ...you have to have a credit card if you want us to rent you a car. This is insane. This is literally insane. They made me the reservation. - Just one second. - Thanks. All right? Are you two together? - Hey. - Excuse me? She should be so lucky. It seems the same company has reserved both your cars. And they both have the same destination. When's your appointment? - Um, seven days. - Mine's in five. You a serial killer? Yeah, no. No, I say. No, definitely not. No. Promise. Never killed anyone. Shame. Well, maybe we could help each other. In killing each other? Well, uh, no. Getting to Dr. Stevensen's. - You're British, huh? - Innit. Do you have earbuds? Awesome. So you, uh, you want to take the first shift and then we'll do a swap out? - You can't drive. - That's not true. I can turn the wheel and everything. Can even stay on the right side of the road. Or is it the left? I'm just kidding. We just need to get away from these rental fuckers. Finally! An adventure, right? You know what's at the end of this. Yeah, everything I've ever wanted. You? It's Blossom, right? - Rose. - Ah. I go by my middle name. Sweet. So you prefer Rose or Rosie? Rose. By the way, uh, I'm Teddy. - That's a pretty name. - I'm not interested. Excuse me? I wasn't offering. Can you, uh, crack your window, please? - It smells like smoke in here. - Oh, that's actually not me. Um, I, uh, I... I don't smoke. Well, uh, I work with some guys who do, and... Yeah, when they're not lifting stuff, they, uh... they just light up. So, and I don't see the point in doing laundry anymore, so. Oh. Please don't, uh. - Ah. - Seventeen missed calls. Oh, and thanks for the license. Yeah, I, uh, can't be arsed with that paperwork shit, so. Yeah. Um... so, what do you do? Did? What... What did you do? Um, what did you do? You're a mover? I actually, uh, I used to have my own company. Had a few, actually. And, uh, you know... Mm-hmm. Sometimes you need the extra cash, right? Do you want to put those earbuds on? Maybe you can use the Bluetooth. Hey, look, there's an article about us. Human Rights Activist Maya Cam. Camp-yon. - Cam... Camp-yon. - Campion. Camp-yon... Campion issued a formal statement declaring that the right to die is a civil liberty. Damn straight. And who the fuck are these senators who are trying to control us? People who don't believe, or don't want to believe. I got you chips. How can you eat that shit? What? Is there a better time? I wonder if cows get to be ghosts. - Definitely not. - How do you know? Because there'd be a whole bunch of mad angry cows haunting the shit outta me. Ah. Hopefully pigs make the cut. Oh, it's an insult. I'm the pig. - It's just a thought. - Hmm. Hmm. Just a thought. Any other thoughts? Things have changed. If you have something left to say to someone who's passed, we are here for you. Our three mediums are standing by... Hey, someone really wants to chat. ...deliver your messages to your loved ones on the other side. Ah. The mystery continues, eh? - Retrial. - Where are those earbuds? I haven't seen them yet. - Willing driver. - With no valid license. - Only on a technicality. - I'm not taking any risks. Oh, right, yeah. Me driving. That's the biggest risk right now. Did I tell you I also know how to use the blinkers? - King or queen for you folks? - Two rooms, please. - The further apart, the better. - We're trying to conceive. - Two rooms that we do have... - Whatever two rooms you have. Oh, um, if you find me dead in the morning, she did it. Yeah. Be sure to thank her for me. Oh. - 6:00 a.m., you got it? - Just so I know, is it gonna be like this the whole trip? I need to be in San Francisco in four days for my appointment. That requires us not fucking around. Okay? Anyway, that's not what I'm talking about. What are you talking about? You don't have to be an asshole the whole time. Excuse me? You heard. Let me make something really clear to you. We're not buddies. We're not pals. We're not in this together. Okay? Bollocks. How many people know what it's like to be us right now? 6:00 a.m., the car leaves. Be in it or don't. - Sharp. - Razor. Oh, my God! Stop following me. I don't want to be your friend! What? Rose. On the sector from Wall Street, the blue chips fell victim to a sell-off... They are so easy... ...at the first pitch and fouled it deep back into the stands behind... Hi, is this the front desk? Is there anything good to do around here? Hey there, I don't want this in my house. Sorry, but my grandmother... ...why this study is so important. So let's get to the question that's on everyone's mind, I think. Are you asking people to end their lives? I'd say this is a beginning for some. So, why can some people see ghosts? I still can't! So, how do you explain that? Mm-hmm. That's right. Uh. Some of our participants have had experiences with ghosts, and others haven't. Uh. What we do know is that not everyone comes back, and we have seen that those who do come back have a strong connection to Earth for a reason. Like... like Niko did with his young son Reo here? Exactly. Uh, this is why the participants in this controlled study are so important. They're ushering us into the next era of human existence. These people are among the bravest and most valiant men and women in all of history. And it all started with young Reo letting you know about his father visiting him? Yeah, that's right. Uh, our first big breakthrough began when Reo's mom saw him playing a card game that only his father knew. The strong connection between Reo and his father brought them together and the rest is, well, history in the making. Reo, how does it feel to be a part of such a world-changing event? I just want to see my dad again. Aw. Kid's the biggest thing in the world and he has no idea. Rose! Come on. Rose! 6:00 a.m. sharp. Hi, how you doing? Um, I've locked myself out. Do you mind just helping me? Yeah. Dying for a piss, you know. - Thank you. Cheers. - All right. Rose? Are you decent? Rose? Rose? Rooo... This is ridiculous. Uh. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Fuck! Teddy! - I knocked a lot. - Can we go? We're headed South, right? Avoid the snow? Oh, God. I need a Tylenol. You cool if we miss New Mexico? I'm cool to make sure we get there. Hmm. I think I plotted us a good route. Awesome, let's go take it. I'm done. Let's go. I got the keys, asshole. So you're saying that this irrational rise in suicides... What's irrational? People are in debt. Even if they do have a job that pays, it's still not enough to own a home. They can't support their families. If there's no end, why not consider the other option? It's easier than getting Canadian citizenship. Uh. Why are we gettin' off the highway? Oh. If only there was someone else who could drive. Such a shame. Do you think this means other things could be real? Ghosts aren't enough? Like fairies, or, uh, jackalope. - That's stupid. - Why's it stupid? Because jackalopes aren't even proper mythological animals. Just invented by a bored taxidermist. I bet you loved telling other kids at school - Santa wasn't real either. - Santa is real. He's a drunk pedophile letting little kids sit on his lap at the mall every year. I supposed the tooth fairy is a crack whore as well. So what made you want to volunteer for the doc? What made you? - You're good at that. - Practice makes perfect. I want my life to mean something. You know, to be a pioneer. To finally have my shot at making... Have you practiced that? You got like an Instagram handle for the afterlife? Oh, and your reason's better, is it? Yes. - You're embarrassed. - I'm not embarrassed. Hey, hey. It's okay. Is it pathetic? Because mine is. No family. No kids. No home. You know, I was gonna come to the States and make it big and have this perfect wife, and travel the world. I've been here ten years, and I've never even left New York State. And now? Now, I finally get a chance to go to California and be a part of something. Now that's fuckin' beautifully pathetic. - There is no beauty in this. - What? Why isn't it beautiful? I mean, it's not just the end, it's the beginning. And doing it because you don't wanna answer your fucking phone is more pathetic than mine. - I lost everyone. - So? I never even had anyone! - But I did! - So? So why... why are you doing this? Because I can't even kill myself. I tried. I tried pills, chased with vodka and rubbing alcohol. I was found three days later in a pool of my own vomit with half-digested pills everywhere. Only thing that happened was that my landlord yelled at me for ruining his wood floors. So fuck 'em. I need someone to do it for me because I can't. All I know is that this hurts all the time. And I have tried to fix it, but... - Whoa! - It's not my fault. - Whoa! - It's not my fault. I mean, I... I didn't mean to. Oh, fuck. Fuck. I... it was an accident. I... It wasn't an accident. Ye... yes, it was! No, no, no. You didn't... No, you didn't mean to. This has been happening. Look. What a douche. I'm supposed to be fixing my own shit, not other people's! Well, now I know what he meant about the wood floors. Should we call the cops? "Hey, we just helped some guy kill himself, but, uh, we're in a rush, so can you give us a ride?" No! Come here. - Wait. - We got to fix the tire. Okay. This will work, yeah? - Yeah. - Okay, so get it on there. Where's the jack? - Balls! - Yeah. Big fat hairy balls. Did you see a garage as we drove through? I saw five burger joints. So we walk or we wait. What do you think, dead guy? Joe. Dead Joe. I feel like he's more of a Jack. What do you think, Dead Jack? Still no service? Fuck! Fuck! We have lost two hours. - We'll be okay. - Breakfast didn't help. Neither did sleeping in or Dead Joe. - Dead Jack. - Dead Jack, fine. You want to walk over there and see if we get some service? Do it. You know of all the ways I would have killed myself, I never would have done what Dead Jack did. - He could have killed us. - Missed opportunity. What does rubbing alcohol taste like? When you drank it? People always say, "That tastes like rubbing alcohol." I was just wondering if they were right. I was 11 when I first tried to kill myself. I tried to overdose with a bottle of vitamins. Yeah. It didn't work, but it did give me the shits for about a week. Then about a few years ago, I jumped off a subway platform, but I mistimed it so I just bounced off the subway car. Bullshit. When I was a kid, I tried to slit my wrists with paperclips, but my arm got too tired so I just gave up. That's a fucking cliché. The vodka was warm and cheap. It all tasted about the same. - Next time you should try lime. - Hmm. Do you see that? Is that? Yeah. - Let me see what I can do. - Yes. Thank you. Thank you. We've, uh... been calling him Jack. That's funny. That's my name. Poor misguided soul. Think they'll find a better way. No shit. I mean a better way to live. Well, we're lucky you came along. Yeah. Well, I walk this road twice a day. We've had to cancel all but two of our masses this week. I'd say you're overdue for a reformation. It'd be nice to see the Catholics do away with a few things. Like mortal sin, condemning of birth control, or the idea that suicides are damned. Yeah. Well... I already got rid of that one actually. My little indulgence. So you're walking this road every day hoping... What? You'll end up finding Damascus? Uh. What's Damascus? Saint Paul. The risen Christ appeared to him on the road to Damascus, showed him the light. Yeah, I guess it's a little like that. Scientific discoveries and religious reformations don't go hand in hand. Oh, seems to me that the two could help each other. Then why did the Catholic Church come out against Dr. Stevensen? Because she is playing God and hurting people. She's preying on the vulnerable. Stealing His gift. Let me, uh, focus on this so I can get you going. All right, we can do this. - Lift this. Ready? - Yeah. Three, two, one. Jesus fucking Christ! Sorry. Okay, okay. It's in. Whoo! Don't worry about the other Jack. I'll call it in. Would you hear my confession? Oh. So? Okay. So I guess he's not done walking. Uh. Can you look up how we, uh, get back to the highway? Mm. Yeah, straight ahead. Route 90. I asked Jack earlier. Father Jack. Not Dead Jack. Yeah. - So you're Catholic. - Yeah. I've been confirmed and everything. Hmm. So how many people do you think breathed a sigh of relief when they found out they weren't going to hell for their sins? Well, I've been to a bar mitzvah. I made confession in Italy. I took a shit in a black cab. I lit my sister's prom dress on fire when I was 14. Why? You would have too, if you would have seen it. I kissed my grandma's friend. Yeah. - I've been on a yacht. - Oh. Fancypants. I crossed the Thames in an inflatable swan. No, you didn't. Yeah, I got arrested and everything. Okay. I, uh, I... I've been to a cockfight. That is disgusting. - I've been to a rodeo. - How is that not disgusting? I ate our goldfish. - Like, the family goldfish? - Apparently, yeah. I've never been to a baseball game. I've been to dozens. Wow, you really love baseball. I hate baseball. It's the dumbest game ever. The entire sport is designed to make everybody else do nothing. The pitcher tries to throw the ball so the batter can't hit it. The batter tries to hit the ball out of the park so the catcher can't catch it. And the basemen guard the bases so the runners can't run. It's designed to make everybody stand around and do fuck-all. So why'd you go? 'Cause that's what you do. Okay, hold on. So, uh, just carry on straight down the highway. I do like your British accent better than Siri's. I thought you didn't like the British accent. But I like the way you say the directions, just that. Continue down this path for three days. Ugh. You can just change regional. We can do Indian one as well. You can. You can put Indian Siri. - That's what I want. - Turn left. Turn right. Okay. Never have I ever robbed a store. - Really? - What? You presumed I had? Why? What gave you the impression - that I would have... - No. You know what? - ...robbed a store? - I'm not gonna walk - into this trap. - What were you basing that on? This is a trap. Um... never have I ever had sex for money. No. Really? Oh, I gotta hear this story. Fuck, no. All right. Okay. I'm going there. Okay. Never have I ever had an affair of any kind. Oh, you're bad. Never have I ever been caught masturbating. Sorry. We used to play this to pass time on patrol and, uh, guess I was just playing along. Feel for you, brother. To cheeky wanks. Okay. Wait, wait. Okay. Me, me, me. Mm-hmm. - All right. Never have I ever. Never have I ever. - Are you with me, brother? - Are you okay? - He's okay. - Here we go. Never have I ever... peed my pants. As an adult, post-high school, post-high school. Amen. Yeah. Of course. Of course it's him. I thought we was a team. I fucking knew it. I knew that was you. All right. Let's see what other commandments we can break. We've got what? - Theft? - Yes. - Sodomy. - Sodomy. - Peeing. - That's times two. - Yeah. - Peeing. - You. - Mm. Never have I ever... ...killed a man. - To Jack. - Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. - Get the fuck out of here. Well... - Holy shit. - Yeah. Yikes. Yikes. How many is that? Four. You shot five men? Why do you always assume we Texans are shooting people? Don't answer that. It was the sun. Twenty miles from the border. Yeah. It was an accident. Not that it makes any difference. I know this is gonna sound corny but I always wanted to serve my country so I got asked to guard a wall. Mostly just processing people. So... ...these two, their access is denied, you know. And we were just following procedure. We've denied this husband, wife access. And he's pretty mad but I don't speak Spanish so I just... I just showed him where the nearest exit was. Right? So the next day, I'm on patrol. Standard. We see these two, and they're making a run for it. We go after them but... ...they're goin' the wrong damn way. And they, uh, they run into this shed, all right. Come up with a plan. We're just gonna scare 'em. All right. We slam the door, you know, bang on the shed, scream some shit. We were in the middle of the desert. We knew... they weren't going nowhere. Next day, we... we head back to the shed and, uh, it was the afternoon by then. When we slammed the door shut... ...it gets stuck. So we had to get a crowbar to open it. And he's got his arms wrapped around... three small kids. These kids... their bodies were empty. Their faces were... melted. It was 135 degrees inside. We cooked them. Can you see them? Right there. That lady doctor... she may be able to see 'em... He's not okay. But she ain't got it all right. They're here to hurt us. And she's fucking letting 'em. I know how to solve it. John, you're cut off, - time to go. - Sam. - What the fuck, man! - Dammit... ...not again, John! You're paying for that! Missed it. Every freakin' night. - Come on. - Where's the gun? Yeah. Where is the fucking gun? Where's the gun? It's right there. Bottle? Don't make me ask twice. Oh. Time for you two to keep moving. Yes, ma'am. Time to go home. Give my gun. No. You get it tomorrow. Teddy. Hey. Teddy, let's go back to the room. All right. Let's get you into your room. That guy was insane. He's just so scared. He held them to the end. That dad. Foot. You know, my dad, he couldn't even wait until I could ride a bike. I was a super-fast learner. Other foot. How could he have known what was wrong with me... back then? - You know, it's weird. - Hmm. I've never been so close to him. What do you mean, "close"? New Mexico. I always thought I was gonna, you know, make it big. Drive west and show him. You know, I got his address. Snuck it from my mom's purse years ago. He sent it all back. All the letters I wrote... photos, drawings, unopened. He fucked off back to the States where he came from and pretended like we never even happened to him. You know, I coulda... college, I coulda worked. A smart job. A real job. You know? If you saw your dad again, what would you say to him if you had the chance? First, I'd break his fucking jaw. And then I'd tell him, "I'd rather kill myself than live the life you gave me." Oh, fuck. What? - What are you doing in my room? - Oh, fuck. That's my bag. Fuck. Uh. I'm sorry. What are you doing in my room? Fuck. Leaving. - Did you tuck me in? - Fuck off. You did! My underpants are missing. I'm joking. They're still on. - Oh, thanks. - Mm-hmm. - Seriously, thank you. - Yep. Okay, fine. I'll drop it on one condition. - I hate conditions. - Of course you do. Let's try and have some fun today, please. You know how I feel about that. I do, but I don't want to be like that guy last night. Okay? I don't want to hate life. I want to embrace what's next. You're not that guy. That guy's got PTSD. Okay, so what's fun? - I did it! Go! - Drive! Drive! Drive! Drive. Whoo! You goddamn hooligans! That was fifteen bucks. I'm still shaking. Hey, ever picked up a hitchhiker? - You need a ride? - Yeah, that'd be great. - I'm Karma. - Oh, uh, Teddy. Rose. - Hey. - Hop in. Where you guys headed? - San Francis... - California. Uh. We're in a hurry. I'm headed to Santa Fe, that work for you? Um, I don't mean to pry. But did you guys just rob that place? Yep. It's part of a process that we're working on. Do you mind shutting the door? We... we really are in a hurry. Yeah. I wanted to rob a bank, but we settled on a case of beer. Ah. So where's the beer? - So what's in Santa Fe? - Oh, um, my aunt lives just outside the national forest near there. She's a psychic, healer, hippie chick. I'm gonna go meet her and her friends. Oh, cool. What for? We're celebrating a family ritual. - Sweet. Party in the desert. - Yeah, kinda. It's important to reconnect in moments like these. I mean, the universe, there's so many shifts lately. Shifts. Yeah. Totally. So, uh, uh, what you celebrating? The Quadrantids. Better than any other meteor shower you've ever seen. It would be nice to see some bright stars. They're not stars. No. It's, uh, it's dust, actually, from the tail of a comet. Just ice and dust that's been left behind from hundreds of years ago. Ice. Okay. - Sparkling cosmic leftovers. - Shit. We need to get gas. I love that. Sparkling leftovers. So you're going to San Francisco? Are you two Participants? - Oh, you mean... - Actually, it really depends on what you mean. Dr. Stevensen's study. - I wouldn't do it. - Well, you don't have to. Well, just not yet. The science isn't there. It's being verified more every day. Just because we can see them doesn't mean we understand them. Over a hundred billion people have lived and died on this planet. Where did they all go? There would be ghosts everywhere. You're talking about the Earth as a closed system, but as you said, the universe is infinitely vast and that's even if our rules of time and space apply to theirs. I get it. I would just wait till the science shakes out. Did you guys see that? Is that a meteor? Oh, my God, you guys. It's the Quadrantids. Let's go find a good spot to see them before it gets dark. Come on. Let's go look. Okay. She's not coming? Are you sure you don't want to come? Uh. I gotta get something inside. - You sure? - Yeah, you go ahead. All right, I'll be back. Okay. Come on. Come see something worth seeing before you end it all. It's really fucking cold. And windy. What is it? Oh, yeah. I just realized I left my phone. Oh, it's okay. You don't need your phone. You know, no matter what, what you do here still matters. Oh. It looks like I won't be losing you two after all. A federal judge has denied Dr. Stevensen's injunction. They're saying it is likely only a matter of days before the trials will be shut down. See? Don't tell Rose. - Hello? - Hi. I'm looking for someone. I'm not sure if he still lives here. You coming? No. I'm not that far. They can come get me from here. Enjoy the journey. All right. - Where's Karma going? - On a star mission. Fuck, it was amazing. I wish you had been there. - Teddy, I found your father. - Hey, would you... Uh. For the gas. Um. Do you know anyone by the name of Joe who works here? Joe? Yeah. He's on his way down to Molly's. Down that way, you'll see him. How do you know Joe? Family. Do you know what you're gonna say? Yeah, um... No, I know exactly. I mean, I thought... I thought it'd be different, but... I'm ready. I'm ready to tell him that he's not forgiven. That he fucked up. That he's the reason. Okay. I'm gonna go in. Get a seat. Watch the fireworks. Teddy... enjoy this. Mind if I sit here? - Now you mention it. - Do we have a fucking problem? You tell me. You don't recognize me, do you? I've waited over 30 years to say some things, so I suggest you shut your mouth, Joe. I'm Charlie. Joe's in the corner. Hope he breaks your nose. What are you drinking? Whiskey. - Whiskey? - Yeah. Speak up. Paul! Paul! - Oh, man. Royal flush. - Holy shit. - No way. - No, I told you, man. Royal flush. Yeah, that's great. I've never seen one on there before. - Joe, that's wonderful. - Yes. Congratulations, man. Four years they've had these machines and no one hit a royal flush before. It's, uh... Whoa. Hey, Paul. I... I... It's got me 5,000. You know, you can't use it for nothing. Still. You know... give me another round, uh, to celebrate. And one for you too, Paul. And you, what are you drinking, huh? What is that, whiskey? Oh. And another one for my young friend over here. Oh, haven't seen one of those. Just haven't seen one. Wow. Hey, what happened? - I don't wanna talk about it. - You had him. It doesn't matter where we're going. Teddy. You need to say it as much as he needs to hear it. Especially because you are dying and he is the reason why. Where's Joe? End of the night. Time to get out. - Where did he go? - Couldn't say. - Don't know, or couldn't say? - Just who are you, friend? Some piece of shit, got a hard-on for Joe. Who the fuck asked you? Boy, it's time to move on. Don't fucking call me boy. - Yeah, that's right. - Hey. Teddy... Go on and fucking hit me! Go on! - Hey! - Fucking hit me! Enough! He's leaving. - Now! - Ladies. Nice boyfriend. Tough guy, huh? Get the fuck out of here. Get out. - Teddy, I didn't know... - You wanted me to do that. You wanted to see me... - ...fucking fail, didn't you? - Hey. Hey, take a breath. Don't tell me what to do. I don't need your help. I'm sorry. Okay? I thought that was going to be good for you. Good for me? You thought that... was good for me? What? You got bored with what, alienating me so you thought you'd wind me up for fun and see me wrestle some daddy issues? You're fucking sick. Blossom, how do you make suicide pretentious? - I don't know. Ask Blossom. - Okay. I'm so fucking tortured. I don't even know what to do about it. You are not even mad at me, Teddy. - So don't act so stupid. - Stupid? - Fuck you! - Fuck me? Fuck me? I didn't want you. The worst day of my life was finding out you were coming. I almost hit your mother. - What are you doing? - Why would I want you? You fucking lifelong parasite. She'd say, "Oh, he's gonna be something amazing." But I knew better. I could see it. You were nothing. - Are you mental? - I didn't want you, you stupid, fucking, pathetic... you worthless, pathetic... - I deserved a life! - ...piece of shit! - Fucking failure! - I needed you. She needed you! She had to work two jobs to keep us going. I never saw her. I was alone. You can't grow right - when you're alone. - You were a defect. No. Nothing was wrong with me back then. I was perfect. You know, I spent so long... trying to show you that I was better than you. I tried so hard to be perfect. And I fucked it up. You know what? I don't give a shit about what you did. I didn't need you then and I don't need you now. What about you? No. No daddy issues. He's dead. I'm sorry. Hmm. It's okay. I didn't know him. We didn't need him. It was always just my amazing mom... and her perfect daughter, and what was left. I used to get into these fights. My sister was always bringing home awards, and... I was the one who got expelled for busting a girl's cheek open with a lunch tray. So I'm not the only one who pisses you off? No. Sadly. I messed up my college scholarship. I was left with a mountain of debt and then I... I missed it. She died. My mom. I didn't say goodbye. I was just so ashamed and... scared that they'd judge me so I didn't pick up their calls. I was so stupid. I... Do you see her? I just want to make things right. It showed up after your mom died? After my mom, I lost my jobs and my apartment. And she took me in. My... My sister. I hadn't seen her in years. And, just like that, she gives me a room in her house, this... gorgeous house. My sister and her husband, Nick, they look like a jeans commercial for the perfect family, complete with their beautiful daughter. And it was going well. Really well. And then this one week, Heather goes out of town for business. And... and Nick. Suddenly this... this shift. He starts letting off steam. Heather's always right and he's always wrong. I get so pissed off at Heather who ended up with this perfect life and I just think, why can't I just have that, even just for a night? And I lean into him. I wake up with a hole in my stomach and Nick is fine... like nothing happened. And that's when I see it. This darkness. Staring at me. It... It knows. It knows I've got a self-destruct button in my heart... and it's fucking irresistible. Oh, I can be happy... for a minute, a day, maybe even a year... but sooner or later, I'm pushing that button. You never spoke to your sister after that? No. I kept waiting for that call. But no, her calls are concerned. And that's worse somehow. I just don't want to hurt anymore. Hey. Um, look, I, uh, I need to say something to you. I don't want to talk about that stuff anymore. No. No, no, no. I need to tell you something else. I don't wanna talk about that stuff either. Hello? Milton... ...you handsome bastard. I knew I'd hear from you. Yeah, we're just on our way to Arizona now. Are you coming home? Ah. Um, I've met someone. That's fantastic. But I think you'd really like her. She's... She's smart. Real. That's wonderful. I told you. You just never know. So are you two coming back? Will I get to meet this girl? Hey, um, no. I've gotta go. - Can you, uh, kiss... - Teddy! - ...Stanley for me, okay? - Teddy. - That's a choice. - I feel like it's fitting. Yeah. Oh, I'm glad. Yeah, that's... Oh, I've got one too. Fantastic. - Twins. - Yeah. It's just what I wanted actually. Yeah. I was gonna ask you when you were going in could you grab me a pair of these? - Looks great on you. - Perfect. Yeah. Hey. Teddy, we're here. What? Rose! Rose! Hey! What is this? Where are we? Oh. Who is it? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. It's you! - Hi. - Hi. Hi. Come inside. Steph, come downstairs. Your Aunty Firefly is here. Come in. Hi. Hi. Oh, my God. - Oh, look how big you are! - Where have you been? She's here. Oh, uh, can I get you guys something to drink? - A coffee maybe? - Hi, kiddo. Oh, look at that. Look at that. Um, maybe a glass of wine would be good. You have to see my room, we changed it! - You have to see! - Okay. Bring her back. Mommy wants to see her, too. Whoo! You know, I forgot my manners. - Heather. Hi. - Oh. Teddy. - Teddy? - Yes. Sounds like there's a story. Come inside. Nick. Okay. Hmm. How many messages did we leave? We left a lot. Just wish you would have let us know you were okay. That's all. You owed us more than that, Rosie. You have an amazing house. Amaz... Amazing house. It's, um, amazing. It was a steal. They all are up here in the desert. Apparently, nobody likes living this far. But we think it's gorgeous. You ever been to Arizona? No. No. Fir... first time. - More wine? - Oh, uh, no. Well, it's an occasion. Of course it is. I'm so happy to see you. - It's... been too long. - That's not what I meant. - Well, do tell. - Well, actually, uh, Rose and I have a lot of ground to cover - tonight... - Mm-mm. - You can't be serious. - We've got time. Well, no, no. I've got stuff to do tonight. And I don't... I don't feel well. Yeah, well, suck it up. Big baby. - Such a baby. - Oh. God, this is a story. Yeah, well, it's a doozy of a story how we met, huh? I don't know that I could tell that right. No, you can't so... No, no. I can. I can. I can tell it right. Um, so the... the thing is Teddy and I are, uh, taking a trip. And, um... I really needed to see you before we go where we're going. - Where are you going? - Rose... It's difficult to say. Um, I'm just gonna say it. - You know, I left the grill on. - No, no, I'll be fast. Where are you going? Rose, where are you going? Just, my God! Out with it. Rose! We're eloping. What? That's... That's amazing. When? Uh. We're going to Vegas tonight. Gonna do a drive-through wedding thing. Oh, my God, that's insane. Yeah. We're selling the car. And, uh, then we're gonna go to Europe. Yeah, I've always wanted to go to France. And then we're gonna go to Oxford where Teddy's from. Uh. London. London is where Teddy's from. We've known each other less than a month. - Holy shit, Rose. - Yeah. I didn't know at first. I mean, how do you ever know? Uh. But this one night, he, uh, told me his truth, and... I told him the worst thing about me, and, uh, it was okay, so. You marry that person. We don't have jobs there yet. But, uh, we've got enough money for about six months. And I'm... I'm just gonna... ...look for a teaching job. And Teddy's got this brilliant idea for a startup, so he's gonna get that going there. And, um... we've been making these lists. Um, things we've always wanted to do. We've been doing that together. For some reason, we've never let ourselves do that before. That's it. That's why I wanted to see you. Both. I'm so happy for you. It's crazy. It's not... not bad crazy. It's just... it's amazing. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well, you, uh, you take care of her now. You promise. I'll do my best. It's nice to meet you, man. Hey, Ladybug. I just wanted to say, um... You know that every time you disappear, another little piece of my heart breaks. And when you used to do this, I would call Mom. Heather, um, I know that I've made your life a living hell most of the time but I... I left last time. - Nick and I, we... - We're good. - What? - He's my husband. This is my family. Then I'm sorry. I thought you should know that I... You don't need to apologize anymore. You've been apologizing your whole life and it doesn't help. I don't need you to fix my problems. I just want you to take care of your own. Honey, we... - we gotta get dinner for Steph. - Oh, of course. Yes. Let me do that now. You guys drive safe, okay? Bye. Hey, that was a... that was a great thing you did back there. It was the best thing, I think. What did Heather say? She wants me to sort my shit. Right. That's good. Isn't it? It'll never go away. You know, what if... what if we just stopped right now? - I can't make it stop. - No, look, pull over, okay? Let's... Let's talk. Let's take a break. Did you go over there so you wouldn't have to cross over? Was that the entire point? The... The trip? Skipping the flight, all of this? I felt something, some force, - drove me there. - No. You drove you there. You can stop. I have to keep going. This is it. Too early for protesting, I guess. You have your IDs? Yeah. Give him your ID. Thanks. You'll need your QR codes at the check-in desks. Follow the road to the parking lot. Welcome! May I have your QR codes, please? Great. And you, sir? We can't have anyone on the premises who's not a Participant. Thank you. All right. - Great to have you, Blossom... - Rose. Yes, of course. Blossom Rose and Theodore. You're a little early, which is great. Dr. Stevensen is finishing up a press conference - but, um, she'll be... - I'm ready to do this now. Well, uh, Dr. Stevensen flew in just for it, - but... - I want to go now. Nurse Ala? Mm-hmm? - Uh. Just one second. Um. Okay, so let's see what we can do. Um, we'll start your paperwork and there's a video for you to watch before your journey so we can get you started there in a few minutes. - Does that sound good? - Yeah. Okay. Follow me. And, uh, you, sir. Will you be coming back for your appointment or... I thought this was what you wanted. Not anymore. Okay, so we are ready for you upstairs. Um, would you like to watch the video together? Congratulations! You are on your way to being an imperative part of our Life Beyond study. You are ready to step into the next stage of evolution with us. You are a pioneer who will forever be remembered for your bravery in building branches between this world and the next. Is that it? Okay, we are all set up to track and record your journey. I'll be there the whole time to help you transition smoothly. - Um, do you have any questions? - Will it hurt? The IV can be a little uncomfortable but we can numb the spot first. We begin with a sedative to help you relax. It's a lot like going under for surgery. Once you're in a state of passing and we can see that you've crossed on our tracking devices, then we terminate your physical form. None of that will hurt. Are you ready? Yeah. Let's just do it. Yeah. Absolutely. So you can follow me and we'll get you changed and started in the Passing Room. Mm-hmm. Sir, do you want to step into the waiting room? Can I stay? It is important that you have a calm - and positive experience... - He can stay. Okay. Yeah. It's good. Come on in. Okay. Can I push this up? Yeah? All right. And let me have you make a few fist pumps. Pump. Four, three, two, one. Good. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Here comes the needle. - Are you ready? - Mm-hmm. In three, two, one. Is that okay? Okay. That feel comfortable? Yes. All right. Shall we? Okay. - No. Just one... - Sir! - No. Sir. Sir. - Just give me... Hey, hey, hey. Just give me one more day. - Sir. - Teddy, what does it matter? One hour. Just give me that. What if I can't? Ten... Ten minutes to think about how you can. I don't deserve it. Five minutes to you realize that you do. No, one minute. One minute to think about what you did yesterday. Not... Not what happened in the past, not what happened when you were younger... and not the things you can't control or the mistakes you made. Please. Just... ...one minute. Just give me one more minute. Wait. Rose. Mom? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I wasn't there. I tried. I tried hard. I couldn't. I... I... No. Rose! She'll never know. She will just disappear. She's dead. Rose, it's Mom. She's dead. Where are you? Where are you? - Where are you? - I'm here. I'm here. Heather. I'm here. Heather, I'm here. - I'm here, Heather! I'm here. - God damn it, Rose! I'm here. You can do it. Come on. Just... Just give me one minute, please. Rose? Wait. - Hey. - I can start with one minute. So, what was it like? It was like almost dying. I don't know. It was all of me all at once. And it was okay. I knew I wanted... to keep trying. You drive? - Seriously? - Yeah, you... - You heard me right. - Wow. You want to die twice? Oh, my God. The car's on my credit card. Thank God it's not on mine. So, we need to drop this off, too. No, let's just take it. I need to go get my dog. - What? - What?
