Don't back down! Get out of here. Go away, half-wit. Apologize to him. Is that what i send you to school for? To bring home snobs? Go away, half-wit! Give it to him! Go! Go, you son of a bitch! She doesn't understand that her father has to like her man too. Tziala, keep out of it. Damn you, you're hurting her! Leave it, mom. It's between us. Until you swear on your sister's soul that you'll dump that snob, you'll stay in the closet. Your soul can join hers and i still won't swear to you. Slut! Where's the key? Above the door. That's it, no more school! No more nothing! She can eat and drink in there. Let her out only to pee and shit. Until she swears to dump that snob, i don't want to see her. Dad. What do you want from her? Go take care of her boyfriend. Don't you tell me what to do. Shut your trap! A good wife should sit at home with her husband instead of letting her father beat him up. She's the bitch in heat that's driving him crazy! I won't swear to you, no matter what. Get in. Who, me? - Yeah, you. Get in. No way. Not with a stranger. Keto. Get in, i'm kidnapping you. Very funny. Bye. Get in or i'll get out. - No way. Come and get me if you want me that bad. Mommy! I'm under age. By law, maybe. I'm a virgin. We'll see about that. Are you gonna rape me? You'll give yourself to me. And what'll you tell my mom? Tell her whatever you want. I've never lied to her. I'm not gonna start for you. Call your mother. Tell her you're with vaja, giorgi and tamriko's son and that you're not a virgin anymore. We'll make the engagement official tomorrow night at your house. I am a virgin. No, you're not. Yes, i am. Leave something for our wedding night. Call your mother, tell her you're not a virgin. I know my mother she'll check me. Let her, no one will believe her. You don't know her. She'll make a fool out of you. Go into the bathroom and do it with your finger. I wanna go home. Marita, come out. It's not nice. It's your brother's engagement party. I'm not coming out till i see sammy. At least eat something. Sammy isn't starving himself. - I wanna eat with sammy. Let her starve in there. She should at least drink something. Fine, as soon as she forgets about the half-wit. What are you waiting for? Why don't you go home? When dad takes care of your brother-in-law's fists, then i'll go home. You'll be waiting till hell freezes over. Your father won't hurt a man for a woman. I won't let him beat me anymore. Dad. What do you say about ottari doing a little time? Half-wit. Why don't you put me in jail and that's it? Tziala wants to go home. If you can't take care of ottari, i will. You take care of ponchika. I gave you two days, you took two weeks. Where is he? Hit it, fellas! The fucking bride is here. A bride that isn't kidnapped is not a bride. Mom. He raped me. Take off your panties. There's no need to check. I'm a virgin. Everyone just heard you say that he raped you. He'll rape me if you call off the engagement. Congratulations. - Thank you. May your turn be soon! You were supposed to take care of ponchika. I prefer to wait. Dad's making my life hell because of you. Do as you're told. Tell dad to find another sucker, leave ponchika to me. Sit, tyson. Dad. Let me have ottari and i'll get this job done. You take care of your job, i'll take care of your sister. Congratulations, my son. Thank you. Dear mother. Abousha. Come in. What time is it? - 3:45. Sit down. What day is it? I didn't want to bother you for a few more days. But since you're here, wait a minute. Who is it? - Go back to sleep. What's that? 2000 shekels. And that? After you stabbed me, my family found out i'm a gambler. Even my own brother won't lend me anything. I barely squeezed this out of my wife's sister's husband. Let me pay back 2,000 a month or chop my head off. Nice head. It'd be a shame to chop off. I'm marrying margo's daughter in 2 weeks. - Congratulations. You're invited. Thanks. - You're welcome. If you don't bring me a gift of 10,000 shekels you won't go back to the hospital. You'll go straight to the cemetery. Don't worry, vaja. Good night, ma'am. Good night. Where's your mother? She took the girls out for a walk... with tyson and marita. What are you doing? I want a man. I need a big cock. Do you want me? Damn you! You she-devil! You're coming out right now. I want sammy. Sammy. ("three" in georgian) I have two sluts in this house. Razo! Yes. - The door's locked. Just a second. What are you up to? What do you want from me? I want you to show me. Go ahead. How did he take your panties off? You're a pervert like your father. You don't scare me. Damn you, you scared me. What about the pants you promised me? Measure yourself. 1010 millimeters, exactly. Turn the tape around up, stand up straight and let it drop. You do it. Your daughter is a virgin. Take her back and marry me. Too late. Everyone knows you've slept with her. We could be together. No one has to know. I'd know. You've made your choice. I sell rubik's cubes for 10 shekels. They're selling like hotcakes. Mix it up, then put it back. That's enough. Stop. Go back and do it in the 4 moves that you messed up. The guy who invented it is a genius. It turns everybody into half-wits. Dad. I'm in love with margo. Now you want to do me in too? Do you all want me dead? Fuck you all, every last one of you! Marita's in the closet waiting for her thief from baghdad, tziala's hanging out at my house, wanting to sit on my dick... and you. Wasn't raping the daughter enough? You wanna screw your mother-in-law too? All i need is for bakho to divorce his sterile wife, and i'll be all set. There's only mamuka, 24 hours a day: "Tyson, come. Tyson, sit!" He's the only normal one, punching that bag! Whole-wit. - You sex maniac! Go back to your fiancee! Dad, come here. Look at this. You half-wit, let him pay! Wait. Good evening. Madam. Congratulations. Good evening, david. - Welcome, ottari. Who gave the most? The bride's mother went all out. Her eldest son is still single. How much did she give? Just give what you want. How much did she give? A lucky number: The bride and groom's ages multiplied by 18, the number of life. 828 dollars. Gurami! Dad. It's bad enough, marita not being here. Me and gurami will take care of ottari. - Who's gurami? Gurami, this is my father. Nice to meet you, mr. Giorgi. Congratulations. Mamuka, my brother. - Congratulations. Gurami works with me at the airport. Are you married? Mr. Giorgi, please, no need to swear. You half-wit! What are you, a faggot? Dad, dad. Why don't you show him around the house? Answer me! Do you want a wife or not? Only if she pees milk standing up. Come with me. It's time to tear... the virgin away from the closet! 18 times tziala is enough. You don't have to give 18 times the twins too. That's 550... and 600. Just give 18 times for you and that's it. Welcome. This will kill them. They didn't even invite me. That's 650... and 700! And 2 dollars... for tziala and the twins! Allow me to introduce you to your future wife, marita! Hello, marita. It's a pleasure to meet you. Who are you talking to? There's no one in there. Good, can i go now? Get in the closet. Surprise your wife-to-be. Mr. Giorgi, we can surprise her downstairs. I like you. I want you to be my son-in-law. Wait for marita in the closet. I'll make a great man out of you. Mr. Giorgi. There's a wedding downstairs. I'm not getting in any closet. Bakho's working on a big job at the airport. I don't want to promise you anything before i talk to him. Daddy! Wait in the closet. I'll go talk to him. If marita gets back before me, tell her that you're in love with her. She believes that stuff. It'll turn her on. Come with me. - What's the matter? Come on. Lya, have you kissed the bride? Yes, on the mouth. And vaja? - He's a boy. But it's his wedding. Go give him a kiss. You'll pay for every day you used to beat her. I want my daughter to feel safe in her own home. Dad, whatever you want. I'd chop off my own head for her. You'll be going to jail for a pretty long time. I don't want to discuss it here. Bakho will explain. Your share of the loot goes to tziala. You won't need any money in jail. When you come out, your wife will be waiting for you at home. Tziala. Don't waste all that time. Come home. I won't lay a hand on you. I'll wait for you if you pay for what you did to me. Tell bakho that i'm at his service. Are you coming? - Yes, i'm coming. Where's gurami? With marita in the closet? Ottari is yours. I'm going to tell gurami that he's in. Tell gurami that i won't divide the loot with someone i don't need. Marita is as important to me as you are. Either take gurami or forget about ottari. Cheers. To your sister and gurami. Dad. Did you hear how much ponchika gave the happy couple? More than margo? - 400 shekels. Good. It's time to give him back his sword. Dr. Fira. You're not very nice. Why did you cure me? With such a pretty doctor, i'd rather be ill. Mr. Abraham you can always visit me. Welcome. - Thank you. Bakho, this is dr. Fira. The woman who saved my father's life. Her husband boriya. Her daughter marina. Nice to meet you, doctor. Tell me what you fix so i'll know what to break. You're already broken. Have some red wine, it's good for your blood pressure. Thank you, doctor. I've danced with a policewoman and a lady lawyer who became a judge, but never with a doctor. May i please have one dance with her, mr. Poriya? Boriya. - Huh? Boriya. - Boya. Be my guest. Cheers. I danced once with a whore who was a kgb officer. Every woman is a general. Doctor. Shall we? Get in. Drop your pants. Let me pay back a little every month. Drop your pants before i make you another necktie. Your underwear too. Kill me, there's no money there. I told you before, your ugly head is of no use to me. I'm doing a big job at the airport. You can either be a full partner and do some time in the slammer, or i separate your dick from your balls. Give my share to my wife. Don't wait till i'm out. You'll thank me when you get out. What's the plan? Have you heard about the delivery that mr. Schtarchman is expecting? Who's schtarchman? - Not now! I don't care about anything i'm the kind of guy who can't take no for an answer yes or no, or no, or no, i won't take no, no! See that woman dancing with your brother-in-law? That's the bitch who won't let me see my girlfriend. What's your girlfriend's name? Marina. Boriya is watching. Take your hand off or i'm leaving. What did he want? She dances on his dick too. Jemali, watch your mouth. You're drunk. He came to visit dad at the hospital and fell in love with her. Stop it. She saved your father's life. I swear on our children. He can't live without her. Nanuli, my sister, i'm sorry, but i can't help but protect you. That russian whore dancing with your husband is having an affair with him. That's what bakho told me about her and your husband. I didn't tell you because i didn't want to spoil your appetite. But now that you're here, shut your trap and go back to your pervert husband or i'll tell you how she fucks his brains out. Lamara! Marita's not in the closet. I told you to invite sammy. I'll invite him to marita's wedding. You should have been my bride. Once is enough for me. I don't need another one. Mom, bring him here. Let's dance! Son of a bitch. Mrs. Vera, may i have this dance? Get up. Vaja. Son of a bitch! What are you doing here? Waiting for my beloved. Close the door. I don't know you. I heard about the time you've spent in here for your love. I've come to save you. I haven't been sitting here for you. I'm staying till you fall for me. Get out, you're gonna get me caught. I'm not leaving without you... who are you? The one who loves you even more after seeing you. But i don't even know you. Nice to meet you. Gurami. Great. Now get out. Good morning, young groom. Where's your wife? You woke me with the smell of that grilled cheese. Never get out of bed before your wife. Go on, back to bed. Wait till she wakes up. I'm late for work. Her mother should teach her what's right. A young groom doesn't go to work. He has to take his bride out. I'll make it up to her in the evenings. I have to go to work. Go back to bed. I'll wake her up. I'll go back to bed if you come with us to the movies tonight. What's the movie? - An indian one. The leading actor has... a dick like this. Go back to bed. Will you come? First ask your wife for permission. Keto! Keto, good morning. Keto, good night. Keto, wake up. Go to sleep. Keto, wake up. Get up. Good morning. Mom, i'm so happy. I know. Congratulations. Good morning. Your daughter brought me luck. Last night i got two more of my kids fixed up. Is that why we didn't see mamuka all evening? With her luck, i'll set him up too. God willing. - Amen. I thought you didn't believe in luck, only wits. Now that i found her, you say it's luck? Isn't it luck that you have wits? Eh, half-wit? I think you're late for work. Congratulations. - Amen. What's he doing here? Waiting for you, like the rest of us. I'm a young groom, you should be grateful i came. I'm so grateful. Now can we get to it? Bakho. Either razo walks or i kill him. You can run things when you learn how to fill out cards in english. A big job like this and you're busy with underwear? He can lift up mom's dress for all i care. Razo. At 7 pm you go to the fatso with the mail from the tarom flight, copy down the hvc list. Gurami, who won't make it to work today, will get rid of the typewriter. Ottari. - Why gurami? At 11:10, 5 minutes before johannesburg lands, you take the bags from my office. Ponchika and ottari, with the bags in your overalls, go up into the hold. Don't nod at me. Get up there. Why gurami? Vaja, as soon as they're up there, turn on the conveyor belt. Vaja, you watch the security men. If you suspect anything, stop the belt. Ottari, you won't be able to see the belt, so keep your ears open. If you don't hear it, don't make the switch. Jemali, razo, you're on the carts. Ottari. Only after you put the bags of diamonds on the floor, you throw our bags to ponchika. Ponchika, you throw our bags to the guards and keep unloading. Throw. Great, ponchika. In the meantime, vaja... vaja. The moment gurami confirms that our bags are in the fatso's safe, only then, you take the bags with the diamonds from ottari, drive to the fence and throw them to me. Why do we need gurami? Any one of us could get rid of the typewriter. 'Cuz that's the way i want it. If you don't like it, leave. What if a guard catches ottari in the hold? Catches who? Ottari. They only caught who they caught. Ottari takes the rap. You're clean. What if they detect it at the airmail complex? We use our cover story, that it was a two-man job. Ottari rats on ponchika and keeps his mouth shut about everyone else. Okay, back to work. Congratulations. - Thank you. You were a lovely bride. Thanks to the dress your mother made, it was more like a coronation than a wedding. Thank you. But hurry up. At your age, i was already breastfeeding. Look at him. As if he's screwing them both. I've got america on my dick! I'm fucking the statue of... bakho, open up, i know you're in there. Open this door or i'll burn it down. One... two... three. Bakho, open up. She's burning down the door! Get out of my way! - Let him open it! You're destroying my family. I'm gonna destroy you. Whore! Where is he? - He jumped out the window. I can smell you. You're not staying here with this whore! I don't see anyone splattered down there. Bakho, i swear. If you don't come out, i'll burn her to a crisp. Bakho! Come out! She's going to burn me. He's in there. Great. You ruined everything. You're going back on the treatments. I've burned two of his whores. Forget him or you'll be the third. Every woman is a general. Where are my socks? Come in. Good morning. Good morning. What's going on? I heard you're not only fucking your young bride, but her full-grown mother too. Thanks, but i'm not worthy of such a compliment. Jemali. I've decided to take on your idea. You're right, we're one too many. So guys... say goodbye to jemali. Thanks to him, we'll have one more share. Goodbye, jemali. Alright, bakho. The deal's closed. You gave me a good answer. I trust you. Take the day off, go see your wife. I'll find someone to fill in for you. This time, i hope you keep your mouth shut. Give him another goodbye. He didn't hear you. Goodbye, jemali. Take your chair with you. This isn't a junkyard. The day after the job, you're not scheduled for work. You'll be at home, waiting to get arrested. No matter what happens, don't leave the house. The ticket was purchased in your name, you're going to france. Let him wait at home for the police, i'll go to france. I'll say you didn't show up for work. You'll get arrested at the airport or when you get to france. There are a few francs in there and a hotel reservation. In any case, ponchika, don't squeal too quick. Play them along. Let them think they're putting one over you. I can't hear you. - Alright. Where did you get the info to forge the bags? From the fatso's office. Where did you get the info for the cards? He just told you. - I want to hear it from you. From the postal lists. How did they make the cards? How exactly did you make the cards? Ottari did it. I don't speak english. Do you? The usual stuff. Why do you ask? Inspector razo wants to know how you made the cards. Like a monkey, i copied it on a typewriter, letter for letter. Great. Anything else, inspector razo? You've thought of everything. That's right, half-wit. Open up! Police! Police! Open up! Well? Run! It's the police! Wait. Go. What a stink! Move! Great! The bags are still here. He shit from fear. He'll have the runs when the cops show up. Move. Why is this bag open? I was about to open the second one too. You caught me red-handed, getting rid of the goods. Great. What'll we have left if he flushes them down the toilet? That's what the cops will think. That the main suspect was caught with half of the goods that he didn't have time to flush down the toilet. But why do the job if you're dividing the goods between the cops and the sewer? We'll empty out the heavy bag in advance, leaving a few granules. The cops will comb through the plumbing and assume the goods were washed away with the shit. You clogged up my toilet! What a genius! What are you laughing at? Go help him. I'm not fishing through shit for fake diamonds. Tziala. What do you want? Hello, mr. Giorgi. Please call tziala. I'll ask her if she's home. Hello. I'll wait for you at home, as we agreed. Don't expect anything from me till then. Tziala, don't do this to me. You can save us. There's nothing to save. I don't believe in you. I swear on our girls, i won't hurt you anymore. I'm not taking any more risks. I don't have anyone but you. Daddy, what did you bring me? Mamuka. Go get the presents. Big hug. My angel. You're not going to work today. I can't get out of this. - You'll rot in prison. At least i'll know that you and the kids got the money. I'm dead if you don't open up. Go. Take care of your mother! Good morning. - Good afternoon, ponchika.
