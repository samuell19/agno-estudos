Man, how you get in my house? Hey, wake up, sleepyhead. What you doin' sleepin' so long? I been tickling your nose for an hour. -No, not really. The door's still on. You'll be all right. -I just want to thank you for letting me be the host of the Shaq All-Star Comedy Jam. I just want to thank you for that, man. I appreciate you findin' my talent enough to be on your show. I'm the host now. -You couldn't-- -It's my scene-- -Man, I ain't got your email. Plus I ain't got no computer. The library closed at the time I want to go in there. But look, man, I got a few ideas. Since you got me hostin', I'm incredibly funny. -You know that. -No. Yes, no-- don't say "no" till you hear what I got-- No, I don't want to hear it. "Chocolate Thunder from Down Under."

Bunny ranch. You know, we just won't get as high as Lamar Odom. -Look, forget all that. -With the way his wife look-- Forget all that, man. Forget all that. Who you got on the show?

Okay, that's good. As long as you know. Hey, you ain't got to throw your money at me like that. That's real disrespectful. Why you even in my house while I'm sleeping? -That's disrespectful. -Well, first of all, what's up with your security system? You payin' people, I got in. Who else you got on the show? Ashy Larry-- Donnell Rawlings from the Chapelle Show. Also K-Dubb. He ain't got no last name and no first name. They just call him K-Dubb 'cause he worked in a rim shop. Last but not least, the incredible master of disaster, -EarthQuake. -EarthQuake, cool. Yeah, he was like-- we got EarthQuake on our show. -You excited about the lineup? You done now? I see you in Vegas after the show. All right, man. Thank you, man. Thank you again, Shaq. However you got in, that's the same way you need to get out. -All right, well... -I'll call the cops on your ass. Can you give me a boost out the window, for real? I came from the top floor down. -Yeah. Man, you wanna get your ass outta my house? Announcer: You've seen him on BET ComicView, Breaking Bad, and from his Comedy Central special. Tonight, he is your host! Give it up for Lavell Crawford! Give it up for y'all selves! Show y'all some love! Come out! You think I got on this bad-ass suit jacket, y'all gonna half-ass clap and shit? This here is all the way from Hong Kong, right off of the wallpaper at a Chinese restaurant. Shit, I'm clean as a tack, shit. I lost a few pounds. I know y'all looking like, "You look good, Lavell!" Shit. People like, "I liked you big!" Well, bitch, I was gonna die. If I'd a' died, you woulda been, "I knew his fat ass was gonna die sooner or later!" That's what people do, you know? You can't even tell people you lost weight until you look like you lost weight, you know? You can't even be like, "I lost a few pounds." They be like... "All right, I see it around your eyes." Well, you know, you gotta do somethin' to help yourself out. You don't wanna say, "I miss food, "but I don't wanna miss my kids and shit, "'cause I wanna get some healthy showin'-- something for your ass," you know. You know, my-- you know, black folk don't never leave their kids no will. They just be fightin' over the change in his jeans pocket. "I get Daddy work boots!" But sure, down here in hot-ass Las Vegas-- it's hot as shit down here. It's ridiculous. Like some brother talk about, "Let's go back to Africa." Fuck that shit. If Africa feel anything like this, you can keep all the motherfuckin' Africans. Shit, 'cause it's, like, 108 here. It's 300 in Africa! And you got to chase your own damn food. I ain't never make it! Shit, I be chasin' the gazelle, out of breath. "Please, let me just get a leg or somethin'!" And then you got to fight lions and shit over the food. You gotta fight-- you can't even go to the damn grocery store and get you a good piece of meat. You gotta fight the lions over your damn gazelle. "Give me my goddamn gazelle!" "Please leave me a little bit." And hot and shit in there in the hut and shit. You ain't got no air conditioning. You ain't-- you just sweating like a son of a bitch. You can't put no damn window air conditioning up in that damn hut. It'd tip the son of a bitch over. I'm glad to be in America. I don't give a fuck. I got central air. It's beautiful. It feel wonderful. I love the central air. Shit. Before-- I grew up in the '70s too, when we had that window air conditioning. That one room be cool as a son of a bitch. That air conditioner be loud as shit-- nahhhhhhhhh! Meeeehhhhh! "Turn it-- turn it on low!" "It is on low." Water drippin' everywhere and shit. But that room cool as shit. No other room cool. You hate to go to the toilet! You gonna-- you gonna burn up walkin' to that motherfucker. And I know about them window air conditioners. 'Cause my mama used to make us stay at my grandmama house and she was mean as a fuckin' rattlesnake. She had a window air conditioner in her bedroom. Her bedroom felt like a fuckin' refrigerator. The rest of the house felt like an incinerator. Shit. It was hot-- She said, "You kids, don't come in my bedroom. Stay your ass in that living room." "But we hot too!" "You ain't that damn hot. Keep your stinkin' ass in that damn livin' room!" I used to go in her bedroom and ask her stupid questions just to cool off. I'm like, "Grandma, Grandma, Grandma!" "What you want?" "Um, excuse me, Grandma. "Um, do you know... if we have some toilet paper in the bathroom?" "You know damn well there's some toilet paper in the bathroom! Get your fat ass outta here!" I come back in there 20 minutes later-- "This is seri-- this is serious!" "What's wrong?" "Um... should I call you Grandmama or Big Mama?" "You gonna call an ambulance you bring your chocolate ass back in here." I hate the heat. I swear to God, I hate the heat. I feel sorry for homeless people down here in this heat. They down here sufferin' like a son of a bitch. There was one homeless dude out there with a sign that said, "I haven't eaten in three days." And I was like, "I'm so sorry." 'Cause I just got that two-for-$10 meal at Burger King. But I had already ate my first burger and I ate it so fast, I still had a taste for the other one. And I wasn't gonna give it to his ass 'cause I had my air conditioning on. And I had that shit on super max. It was drying out my eyelids, but it was feelin' so fucking good, I couldn't wind my window down 'cause it would let all my cool air out. I was like-- I was like, "I'm sorry, man. "I would give you a piece of this sandwich, "but I'd let all my cool air out. "You gonna have to see me on a cooler day. "And I know you haven't eaten in three days, "but I just want to let you know, food is still delicious." And I drove the fuck off. I know some of y'all are sayin', "You ain't shit! You ain't shit! That could be you out there." I say, "I sure hope not." I would look ridiculous out there right now, holding a sign that said, "I haven't eaten in three days." People be drivin' by, "That's good! That's good! "Let everybody else eat for a change. "Make it three more days, "and we'll bring you a salad... with no dressing." The kids be on the school bus, "He's lying! "He had to eat somethin' or somebody!" But we gotta laugh, man. A lot of shit goin' on. A lot of shit goin' on. We got all this shit goin' on-- the Black Lives Matter and all this shit. They want you to march and shit. Yeah, that's good. Thank you. Thank you-- thank you for marching for me. 'Cause I ain't in marching shape. Fuck that shit. I don't know. When we gonna get to what we want, nigga? How long we got to march before the victory happen and shit? That's why I thank God for my forefathers and everybody back in the Civil Rights days marchin' for me, 'cause I couldn't a' done this shit, for real. Shit. I thank God for Martin Luther King. Martin Luther King could talk your ass into anything. I mean... "We marched on Arkansas. "We marched on Mississippi. "But today is our victory. We about to march on Selma, Alabama. Y'all ready?" "Mmm, excuse me, Mr. King? I don't want to interrupt. "I don't want to interrupt, but is anyone drivin'? "'Cause my feet are hollerin'. "I swear, my feet are burnin' like a motherfucker. "I mean, I think I'd a' walked all to freedom in my damn shoes. "Where'd y'all get your Civil "'Cause these-- these do not have the victory in 'em. Shit! "I mean, ain't nobody else feet burnin'? Shit. "My feet are on fire. "Shit, them police spray that motherfuckin' water hose "all up here on my chest? Nigga, put it on these feet. "Put some of that cool, cool racism water on these damn feet." Shit. I-- I can't do that. Every time someone says, "Lavell--" 'Cause I'm from St. Louis. Every time I-- "Hey, Lavell, why don't you come down here and march with us, man? We need some celebrities to march." I be like, "Um, how far are y'all marchin'?" Shit! Shit. I don't know. You talkin' about, "We gonna start at First Street and end at 122nd Street." I like, "Shit. "I'm gonna march by Uber cab, nigga. "Hands up, don't shoot. Hands up, don't shoot! Make a left right here. Hands up, don't shoot!" They-- they trippin' with all that shit. Them damn police actin' a fool-- I'm so scared of police right now, nigga shit, every time I see a cop, I play dead. Police be like, "Damn, when did I kill him? I don't even remember." Shit, them niggas be fightin' the police. They chokin' 'em, they fightin' 'em till they die. Fuck that! Nigga, I'm a' play dead. As soon as he wrap his hand around... Like, "Holy shit! "He died so fast. He's so big, but yet so fragile." 'Cause niggas ain't gonna help you. They all just videotape-- "We got you, dawg! We got you right on tape! We puttin' your death on Facebook." "Fuck that, nigga! Put that shit down and help me, motherfucker!" What the fuck you marchin' for? Nigga, don't put no T-shirt with my dumb ass on it, nigga. Help me, motherfucker! Put your little raggedy iPhone down and fight that nigga! Shit! Get him-- At least hold the nigga till I can run. I mean, it's gonna be about 40-- 45 minutes, 'cause I don't run fast. I'm a trotter. You know? I mean, that bullshit-- nigga videotape niggas gettin' their ass whooped. That's why I don't fight no more. When I grew up, we didn't have no video phones and shit. The only time you knew I got my ass whooped is you was there, or that nosy-ass lady on the porch tell everybody. "We heard you got your ass kicked." "Fuck you, Miss Brown." Everybody goin' through it. Even animals gettin'-- animals' lives don't even motherfuckin' matter no more. They kill poor Harambe up in that motherfucker 'cause he was draggin', like-- like-- like down there in Florida, that motherfuckin' alligator knew he fucked up when he ate that white baby. All them black babies he could have ate, he gonna fuck up and eat that white one. You don't eat no white baby! You don't fuck-- don't fuck with no white kid. They drained the lake on the motherfucker! Fish out there floppin'-- "What the fuck is going on?" "Oh, the alligator's mad-- that punk-ass nigga Alonzo sat up here and ate a white baby!" "You dumb motherfucker. Why would you eat a white baby? "All these other fuckin' delicious-ass, "multi-cultural babies you could have fuckin' ate. "You know not to eat no white baby. Now we ain't got no water to swim in." They had them alligators in lineups and shit. "Where was you when the white baby came up missing?" The alligator was-- the alligator was lying like a motherfucker-- "At the salad bar." "You a lyin' motherfucker. Turn him into some shoes." I'm sorry. I don't work for CSI or nothin', but I don't believe them fat-ass white folk. I don't believe that baby was ate by an alligator for fun. First of all, right now, I ain't starting no shit. But how the fuck the baby was still together when they fuckin' found him? That's a goddamn alligator, nigga. That's an alligator. I watch Animal Planet all the fuckin' time. And every time-- I ain't no animal expert, but I know that motherfucker got rows and rows of motherfuckin' teeth. And that's a two-year-old baby. Two-year-old babies are delicious and tender. I know, 'cause I've bit my son before. And he was delicious and tender! And I told his ass-- I said, "Nigga, you ever fuck up, you gonna be in some greens with some sweet potatoes." That alligator didn't tear that baby the fuck apart? Let me tell you something-- I would rip that baby apart. I would eat the fuck-- there wouldn't be nothing left but a diaper. You understand me? They lyin'! They lyin'. I don't give a fuck what you say. They lyin'. Just like in-- I thought that was a white baby that fell in there with Harambe. I thought he was just light-skinned. He was-- he was real yellow. He could play for the Golden State Warriors in about 10 years. I call Golden State, "The Golden State Light-Skinned Warriors." That's what I call them. They got one dark nigga on the team and his name-- he got a nigga name too-- Draymond. Ain't that a bitch? "Draymond." Nigga, that's black as shit. You can't get no blacker than Draymond. Mama evil as hell. She didn't never like the name "Raymond," so she put a "D" on the motherfucker. "His name Draymond." Bitch, it's D'Raymond. That's what it is. Black folks always fuckin' their kids' head up with these stupid-ass names. They talkin' about, "My name's Erica, but it's spelled with a 'B.'" Bitch, that's B'Erica. Sit your stupid ass down, B'Erica, and your crazy-ass brother D'Raymond. Yeah, the Golden State Warriors, they so light-skinned-- they so light-skinned, they look like eight golden Power Rangers fightin' LeBron in the NBA final. LeBron look like an evil villain. Like a big, giant Black Lives Matter shirt on, fuckin'-with nigga with almost credit-- fuckin' with them motherfuckers. And they attackin' LeBron, he just lookin' like a giant. "Get out of my way!" And LeBron is young as shit, but look like he's about 74 years old. And I can always see when he ain't doin' well, 'cause his hairline start goin' back. That nigga, every time-- every time they behind, his hairline go back four inch. As soon as they start winnin', that shit come right back down. But yeah, when that gorilla-- when that gorilla got that baby and them white folks was, "Oh, my God! "He's draggin' the baby. He's draggin'"-- Bitch, he a gorilla. He ain't got no child-development skills. That's what the fuck he's supposed to be. And that black baby needed his ass whooped. 'Cause I know damn well if that was me in that fuckin' gorilla pit, my mom would've snapped. She would've been like, "Your motherfuckin' ass. "I told you in the car... "stay by me! Now look at your stupid ass "that fell in this goddamn gorilla cave. "No, leave him in there. Fuck that. "Leave him in there. "Here my camera. Take some pictures with that motherfuckin' gorilla. "'Cause when you come out of there, I'm whoopin' your motherfuckin' ass. "You better hope he kill your ass before I kill ya!" "Ma'am, we got your baby out safe." "I don't give a fuck. Put him down. "I told your stupid ass not to fall "in that motherfuckin' cave. Get your hand off me, bitch." They'd have to tranquilize my mama-- shoop, shoop! "When I wake up, I'm fucking your ass up again." Are y'all ready to laugh? Are y'all ready to get down? We gonna have fun tonight. This ain't time to be cute and shit. We know there's some Omega Psi Phi here. Thank you. -Thank you. All right, that's wonderful. Did you graduate, motherfucker? That's what we need to know. Shit. All that stompin' and shit. And you know, brother, I'm gonna get you one of them T-shirts 'cause, nigga, you as black as a motherfucker and your life does matter. That nigga got on white so his friend can find him. That nigga is blacker than a motherfucker. That nigga need $45 for being that damn black. You here. Don't be mad at me. You're like, "Who are you talking to?" Nigga, you. Like you a nigga gold. He take his clothes off, he disappear in this motherfucker, you turn these lights off. But we-- I'm just fuckin' with you. Don't get all upset and shit. Y'all putting your heart on your shoulder. "Ain't this a bitch? I done lost $200 on the blackjack and now this motherfucker want to--" Well, we got some funny motherfuckers tonight. This first comedian I'm bringing to your stage, he come all the way from Mississippi. All the way from Memphis, Tennessee. All the way straight out of Atlanta. Show him a lot of love, ladies and gentlemen, for my man K-Dubb! -All: Yeah! Y'all laid back. Like, everybody wave your hands side to side. Y'all look stupid as hell. I don't know what the fuck y'all doin'. All wavin' your hands, like "What the fuck are we supposed to be wavin' our hands for?" Give y'all self a round of applause comin' out tonight. Lavell be talkin' about Vegas is hot. This shit hot as hell, ain't it? I like it hot. I don't like it cold. I hate when it's cold, 'cause I'm dark-skinned. You know what the fuck I'm talking about-- dark-skinned fellas, we-- he know what the fuck I'm talking about. We get ashy quick as hell. Lips get chapped. You ever see somebody, lips so chapped, they make you put on your shit? You were not about to put your shit on till they walk up. You be like, "Oh, hell naw, there it is right there. "This nigga's lips are like a margarita glass. How the fuck you do that?" Like, get your lives together. I don't give a damn who you are. Stop doing stupid shit. Don't you hate when you tell somebody where you from, they ask you do you know one person from there? Like, "Where you from?" "Memphis." "You know a nigga named Craig live down there?" "Hell no, I don't know one motherfucker named Craig." You tell somebody your birthday, they want to tell you somebody's birthday that's close to yours. "When your birthday?" "June ninth." "My uncle's on the 12th." "I don't give a damn about your uncle's birthday. "What you want me to do? Get him something? I don't even know him." You ask somebody how old their child is, they give you two ages, like you gonna figure this shit out yourself. They give you two ages. "How old your son?" "Seven, about to be eight." "Bitch, you don't have to say eight. I know eight come after seven." They just be addin' shit in-- "Eight. Seven, about to be eight." "Brand-new." What the fuck is brand I hate when people say "brand-new." "I got a brand-new car." "Don't you got a new car or a brand" What the difference is? What the fuck is "brand" anyway? "First thing in the morning." What time is "first thing in the morning"? "I'll be there first thing in the morning." What the fuck is "first"? I get there at 6:30, you still complaining. "Nigga, I said first thing in the morning." What time is first? People say dumb shit all the time. My homeboy was giving me my confirmation number over the phone. He was like, "C as in cat. You got that?" I was like, "Man, you ain't got to say 'cat,' just say the shit." He said, "A as in apple. You got that?" I'm like, "God damn." He said, "Y as in U-turn." I said, "There ain't no damn Y in U-turn." That's why I told you, stop saying that shit. People don't give a fuck no more. How many people in here-- real fellas, we got Que Dogs and shit. How many of y'all facin' time-- y'all real-- if you facing time, you will snitch on somebody. Clap for yourself if you will snitch. Give yourself a round of applause. Go on, represent your clique. Where you at? Niggas ain't clappin'. Y'all full of shit. Talk about "snitches get stitches." You ever hear that shit? Stitches heal up in two weeks. Them 30 years ain't goin' nowhere. I don't know who-- I don't know who the fuck taught you how to add. That shit do not add up. Police pulled me over speedin' the other day. "Whoo. So you were speeding back there." "Yeah, but I know a brother on the westside, selling dope, God damn it. You need to go pick his ass up. I am not going to jail." I used to not snitch before The First 48 came out. When that shit came out, I said, "Fuck it. "I'm gonna go on and snitch. Everybody else snitchin'. Fuck it. I might as well go on and snitch." I seen a motherfucker walk in on First 48 and ask for the "blur." "Have y'all got the blur? "I tell it, I don't know-- "I mean, I tell you exactly what the fuck happened. Just give me the blur." "What the fuck is the blur?" "The blur-- when they cover up your whole body. "Just give me the blur. "I'm a' tell everything. Give me the blur. "I ain't tellin' shit without the blur. "And make sure you throw in the voice too. "I want the voice too, God damn it. I want the blur and the voice. I want the whole kit." I seen somebody snitch so fast on First 48, he snitched on somebody from a whole 'nother episode of First 48. He snitched on somebody from CSI. I said, "How the fuck you do that?" I seen somebody snitch on somebody from an old TV show. He snitched on somebody from In the Heat of the Night. I'm like, "How the fuck did you pull that off?" "Can I talk to Virgil Tibbs?" "Hell naw, you can't talk to Virgil Tibbs." They got it set up just for your ass to snitch now. They got the blur. You ever see a motherfucker behind that blur talking, snitchin'? You ever see him back there, behind with the blur? And the blur follow their ass everywhere they go, don't it? I don't give a fuck what he do, that blur right there on his ass. He be like, "Hell naw." Then he got the voice-- "You know, uh... "Freddy shot Tony in the ass three times." "Are you sure about that, Keesha?" "Yep, I'm sure about that. "Shot Tony in the ass three times. I saw it with my own eyes." What the fuck is "seeing it with my own eyes"? Who else's eyes you saw it with? "I heard the shots with my own ears." Who the fuck else's ears you saw it with? I seen a motherfucker snitchin' behind the blur one time and fucked around and sneezed, and sneezed his ass right outside the blur. He did sneeze his ass smooth out in the hallway-- "Yep, Freddy shot Tony in the ass "three time-- ah-- ah-- achoo! "Oh, shit. "Turn it off, turn it off, turn it off. "Turn the camera off. Y'all think you saw me? "Turn it off. Turn the shit off. "Look, Freddy, if you see me, I didn't say shit, bra. "God damn, I think he saw me. Turn the camera off. "Turn the lights off. "Excuse me, ma'am, can you get the nigga that's working the voice so I can talk to Freddy?" "No, sir, the nigga that work the voice took a lunch break." "Fuck you mean, he took a lunch break? This nigga out here." Get your life all the way together. I don't give a fuck who you like-- get it together. If you in here, you sleep on an air mattress, go on kill yourself. It's 2016. Fellas-- fellas' air mattresses ain't shit. Women got the best air mattress. I went to one woman's house, she had an air mattress with a headboard on it. I say, "How the fuck you get a headboard?" She had a headboard and a footboard. I said, "I'm gonna sleep in this motherfucker here tonight." I looked in her kids' room, they had a bunk-bed air mattress set. I said, "How the fuck you got a bunk-bed air mattress?" I stayed there, though. I stayed there, woke up the next morning. She didn't tell me she had a slow leak. I went to bed, I was this high. I was this high in the bed. I woke up, my damn arm was on the floor. I said, "Bitch, you could have told me you had a slow leak. "How the fuck my real ear on the floor? How'd I fall asleep with my ear on the floor?" I said, "Bitch, you got a slow leak. "Shit. That's why I got up at 6:30. "Bitch, you know the time the air go out of the mattress? Fuck, you know the time the air go out the mattress." That's dinner with them hood chicks. We got any hood chicks in here, by round of applause? -I knew there was one. You ask a hood chick how many kids they got, they tell you "a whole lot," so when they do tell you the truth, it won't seem as bad. "How many kids you got?" "17." "17?" "No, I ain't got but eight." "Oh, I was about to say, shit, I could deal with that goddamn eight. "That 17 had me, 'See ya, bitch.' I can-- I can deal with that eight, though." Get your lives together. I don't give a fuck who you are. Get it all the way together. Gas prices steady, goin' up and down. Trick you-- go up 2 cent, come down four, go up nine and come down 12. Then they wait till you go to sleep before they change the price. I don't know what the fuck they doin'. Then they always make the shit $2.62, $2.52. How much gas is here? You don't know? $2.52? They always make the shit odd like that. They never make it even. If it was $2, $3, you could add the shit up. If it was $3, you give 'em $21, you got seven gallons. The shit $2.52-- you can't do the math on that. You could carry the one, but you don't know where the fuck to carry it to. That $2.52 fuck you up. You give 'em a $20 bill, they give you 8.359 gallons. You standing there like, "I know they fucked me out of something, "but I can't prove it. I can't carry the goddamn one." That's... That's the reason, when I get my gas, I get it all one at a time. Let me get $2.62 on pump one. I go out there and pump that one and come right back again. "How you doin', sir? Let me get another one of them $2.62s." I go out there and pump that one and bring my black ass right back-- "I don't mean to fuck with you, sir, but let me get one more addition of $2.52." I need all my goddamn gas. Anybody fuck me, I'd a' nail on of 'em. You know black people, we'll come back in and skip the line. "Excuse me, sir. I was already in here three times. "Let me get another one of them $2.52s. "I already been in here. I ain't got to talk to you. I did not skip the line." Black people-- we the only race of people that won't stand in line for shit, won't... We won't stand in line. We'll try to walk by the line. Where the line is, we'll try to walk and try to integrate real slow. Try to ease in there. You be like, anybody get in front of me, I don't give a fuck what you do back there. You go to hatin' on him, tellin' everybody in the front-- "Hey, look, he tryin' to skip. Watch his ass right here. Your ass ain't about to skip me." I hate goin' in the grocery store and the line long. You ever go in there, the line long. Black people, we'll fill up the basket and leave the whole fuckin' basket, won't we? We'll get to the counter and see the counter and see the line is long as fuck and leave the basket. "Fuck that basket. I'm gonna get the fuck on outta here." You ever see somebody tryin' to stand in two lines? They got the basket in the middle? He in seven and eight, tryin' to see which one gets shorter faster. Somebody come behind you, "Which line you in, sir?" "Bitch, I'm in both of these lines right here. "You need to get your ass down there and find you two lines. "These mines right here. "As a matter of fact, you can take seven. I'm gonna go to eight. They already open, god damn it." Y'all see a nigga put their basket in one line and be in a whole 'nother line? He be down there lookin', trying to see another line. Somebody get in front of his basket-- "Hey, playa, don't get in front of my basket. "No, I just saw you tryin' to get in front of my shit. "Let me scoot it up some. Yeah, it's fine. Nobody try to get in front of my goddamn basket." My mama used to bring me to the store and just put me in a line. She would come in the store, "Go get in line. I'm about to go back here and get some French fries." "Fuck you mean, French fries? "I ain't about to stand in line. "Now I got to stand in the front of the line and let people skip. "Go ahead, go ahead. God damn, where the fuck my mama at? "Not you, just them two. Not you, just them. "Them two right there. "You tell the cashier I'm gonna let these two go, "but don't get him yet, 'cause I don't want my mama to come back and I ain't got my shit together." Hate standin' in line. You know, you standin' in line, them goddamn Mexicans stand right behind you. They be right there on your goddamn back. Every time you goin', that motherfucker right there. You-- "What the fuck is wrong with you, bro?" "Hey, my friend, you got to go up, my friend!" "Bitch, you ain't got to stand right there. You get out the line. Go ahead, you can have that shit." "Oh, you're in line?" "Hell yeah, I'm in line! "But he got his dick on my back. "I'm in line, but he got his dick on my back. "I don't want no dick on my back. "You come get in line, let him put a dick on your back. "Get your goddamn dick off my back. Son of a bitch." One time, I was way back there in line. It took me two hours to get to the front. You ever been like that? Two hours to get to the front? I'll get to the front and go to put my shit on the counter, and as soon as I put my shit on the counter, the girl at the cashier tell me she want to go on break. As soon as I put my shit on the counter, she say, "Sir, I'm about to go on break." And she reached up and turned the light off-- poof! I was like, "Bitch, you got me fucked up." Poof! I turned the light back on. "You got me-- bitch-- I been in this line two hours. "You got me fucked up. "You better get your goddamn dick off my back. "Bitch you--" poof, poof-- "You better leave that goddamn light alone. "Leave that goddamn light alone. Bitch, I been in this line two hours. You get your dick off my back. Look--" poof, poof. Poof, poof. "Bitch, you better leave that goddamn light alone." Poof, poof. Poof, poof. Poof, poof. Hey, man, y'all been a hell of a crowd. I'm Comedian K-Dubb. Thank y'all. K-Dubb keeping it real up there. Black folk do not like lines. You gotta keep it real, man. We all are worried about everybody else. Worry about us. Worry about yourself. Y'all worried about white folk gettin' fucked. White folk ain't gonna never give a fuck 'bout you. They don't care. They don't give a fuck. They'll report you. I live in a white neighborhood. I love it, 'cause white people will watch the fuck out of me every time I-- They seen me for two years. They still look at me as I drive in my driveway. "Who is that?" "Oh, that's you! Okay." "You about to report me, motherfucker, weren't you?" "No, not yet. You look familiar." And I'm joking, 'cause I got white friends. I got some white friends. I never introduce 'em to my black friends, you know what I'm saying? 'Cause I don't want to lose my white friends. You know? Shit, 'cause you gonna need them sometimes. I need my black friends to laugh and love and get fucked up with. You know, to talk about some white folks. But I need my white folks for, like, tax advice and, you know, when I want to feel comfortable asleep at night, to watch my motherfuckin' house and shit. White folks will watch the fuck out of your house. Especially a black house. They'll watch the shit out of your house. You gone for a couple days, they'll call-- "Hey, Lavell, I know you're out of town." "How the fuck you know I'm out of town?" "Well, I seen when you left. "But there's a person up at your door. "I don't know if you know this person? "He acts like he knows you. Uh, should I call the police?" "Hell, yeah, call them motherfucker. I didn't tell no motherfucker to come over to my fuckin' house." Hate unannounced motherfucker-- "I was in the neighborhood." Fuck that. Keep driving through. Y'all ready for more laugh? Are you ready for more laugh? This young lady come from D.C. Livin' in Atlanta now. Been on everything. You gonna love her. Put your hands together for the very talented and lovely Cocoa Brown! How y'all doin'? Hey! I want y'all to give me a round of applause. Honey, I just 150 lbs, honey. Yes. Yes! It's this new diet called a divorce. Praise Jesus for a divorce! When I think about the goodness of Jesus! Honey, I didn't know I had slave in me till that judge told me I was a free "nigra." He was like, "Divorce granted!" And I said, "Thank you, sah! You go, white folk! Go, white folk!" Child! And I wanted my marriage to work. I did. I fought tooth and nail, but you can't fight by yourself, honey. You know what I'm saying? My husband had this disease we couldn't cure called "Nigga Won't Work." I can put up with a lot of things, but I'll be damned you don't bring a check in this house. And just 'cause you ain't working a day job don't mean you don't put in work. And if you don't know what I mean by "putting in work," you ain't putting in that work. If I'm going to a day job and you ain't, I should be going to my shit in a wheelchair. I'm gonna let that marinate for you slow people. Bottom line, man, you can't be a lazy fuck and a lazy fuck. That's an oxymoron. Oh, y'all ain't ready for a bitch like me. And the thing is, now I'm out here single, tryin' to mingle. The game has changed! You know, now men want perfection. You know, their woman got to be perfect now. Can't have no flaws. Let me tell you something, men. You can't ask me to be shit you ain't. You better know your lane. See, Jay Z got a lot of y'all fucked up. 'Cause y'all look at that jack-hammer-ass-lookin' negro and think that could be you. That you can have the "baddest chick in the game rockin' your chain." No, it don't work like that. Jay Z got swagger and a whole lot of money. $25 million make me get past the fact his lips so big, it tell himself a secret. I'll be your ChapStick, Carmex-carrier bitch, you hear me? I be like, "Baby, you a little chapped. You a little chapped. Do like that." You up here wantin' you a Beyoncé. You ain't no Jay Z. You want me to be perfect, askin' me to be shit you ain't. You can't ask me to have long, pretty hair, you bald-headed with two dreads hangin' on. Goin' to ask me to have pretty feet and pretty toes. But every time your ass go barefoot, you start a forest fire. All eagle-talon ass, sandpaper-ass feet, rubbin' on me at night. Think that shit feel good, 'cause my eyes closed. No, I'm losin' blood, bitch! Y'all ask me to have good credit, but your ass can't get a pre-paid cell phone. Your ass got turned down at Cricket. Nigga, kill yourself. You ask me to have pretty smile and pretty teeth, but every time you open your mouth, I'm like, "Happy Halloween." Oh, Jack-o-lantern- mouth-havin' ass, every other tooth just missing. One tooth say, "Next tooth, two miles." Talk about, "I look like Michael Strahan." "No, the fuck you don't." Michael Strahan got a gap in the front. Your gap the whole left side of your face, son. Every time your ass talk, you whistle, and you wonder why dogs keep following you home. 'Cause you callin' 'em. And the one that pisses me off to my spirit is how we got to have perfect bodies, ladies. Can't have no excess weight. Can't have no stretch marks. Gotta be the right complexion. Gotta have long hair. Gotta have the perfect titties, the perfect ass. Our knees and elbows gotta be the same color. And you got the gall to ask me to have a flat stomach. How dare you? There's so many women in here want to laugh right now, but that waist-trainer got their asses so, just sucked the fuck out of their body! Just sittin' in the audience-- That bitch gonna nod off like a dolphin-- How dare you ask me to have a flat stomach and your ass got a dicky Your stomach stick out more than your dicky do-- really? Every time you come in the room, I think I'm naked with your Rick-Ross-built ass. Layin' on top of me with them man titties brushin' across my face, tryin' to make me suck a titty. Maybe I don't want to be gay. Got me layin' there-- "I don't want to be gay. "Get your titty out of my face. I don't want to do it. "Fix me, Jesus! Help me, Lord. Get it out of my face. I don't want to be gay!" Then got the gall to ask me to give you some head. I can't hold your stomach up and give you head at the same time. I don't have the kind of upper-body strength. I got to be a damn bodybuilder and know how to clean and jerk all this shit. And you mess around, let your stomach go while I'm down there. Next I'm between your stomach and your balls. The whole right side of my face smell like scrotum. You ever try to get ball smell off, girl? I don't give a damn what you use-- that shit like skunk. You got to bathe in tomato juice. Oh, don't get quiet. You men know your balls stink. You play with 'em all day. Wipe your face by accident, get lightheaded. That's your nut, son. Ain't nobody spray nothin'. Tell me how a lot of men get mad at that joke. "How you gonna talk about our balls? Talk about these women." I'm like, "Hold up, you telling me in 2016, we still got grown women don't know how to take care of their vaginal region?" Then I thought about it. Every woman in here, including myself, has walked into a bathroom in a club or bar and smelled that one chick. You be at the sink, minding your business. "Bitch, is that you? That ain't me. Who the fuck is that?" You will hunt this fuckin' heiffer down. There is no excuse, ladies. We have a whole aisle at "Tar-jay" and Walmart dedicated to coochie-care crises. You got Massengill, you got Summer's Eve. Your shit real bad, get some Pine Sol. Feel the burn. There is no excuse, you open your legs and Mystikal jump out-- "Danger!" "Oh, I thought he was in jail." "No, here I go!" Bitch, kill yourself. And ladies, understand that you got to treat yourself right. 'Cause a man treat you how you treat yourself. Understand me? To my big girls out here, love all that God gave you. Stop tryin' to compete with the skinny chick. First of all, you ain't even doin' it right. You know, you're tryin' to go to the gym or get on Herbalife. No! You puttin' on shit too small, like we can't see you. If I see one more 200 lb bitch puttin' on a tube top in the club lookin' like Optimus Prime... You know I ain't lyin'! And they don't do us right. They don't give us no stores to go to. Skinny girls got a 1,000 stores to go to. What big girls got? Lane Bryant, Catherines, Ashley Stewart. We want to get sexy. You ever try to get some "lingery" out of Ashley Stewart? I ain't never seen a thong that big. David could have killed Goliath with that motherfucker. I took one home. My kids was double-Dutchin'. They outside killin' squirrels and shit. And I'm just not talkin' about the big girls. Skinny girls need a wake-up call too. Think you're so cute with your bony asses. Can't wait to come outside when it get hot, all half naked. Nobody want to see that shit-- your blood runnin' through your veins, your heart beatin', your innermost thoughts and fears, your future. Put some clothes on. Hate to see a skinny girl wear a pair of leggings and her legs don't touch, like a damn avatar! You ever seen this shit? Lookin' like parentheses, just walkin' around. "Girl, let's go over here." Y'all sit your bow-legged ass down. Let me explain something to you, skinny chicks. Scientific studies have proven that your thighs need to rub together. That's what keep the juices tight, okay? That's what makes the booty rotisserie. Very tasty, nutritious. Lot of vitamins and minerals, antioxidants. Real good for bald spots, razor bumps, chest colds, swine flu, rickets, shingles, lazy eye. Every dude in here with a big girl ain't been sick since he been with her. I feel sorry for the skinny girl, got that gap, nothing protecting your stuff. Just exposed to the elements. Need a coochie coat. Don't let no wind come through here-- gonna be dry coochie all through Vegas. Dry coochie make a nasty sound-- "What the hell is that? Your transmission slippin." "Girl, I think your puppy got worms." "I think your computer goin' out." "Bitch, you got dial-up, everybody got broadband." "You know, I don't feel safe. I'm a' go home." That'll be a ringtone. Make sure y'all download that, you hear? Dry coochie alert. Dry coochie alert. Dry coochie alert. And don't try that shit at home. Took me a long time to master that noise. Don't be at home later with your man going, "Baby, what-- What's wrong with you?" Now I need y'all do to me a favor, you hear? I need y'all to follow me on social media 'cause I'm told I need more followers. But you know, I'm everywhere-- Periscope, Twitter. All that stuff. You can just Google me-- Cocoa Brown. C-O-C-O-A Brown. C-O-C-O-A Brown. Please don't forget that "A." 'Cause if you do, you will get a porn star, and that's not me. I found that shit out by accident. Got a call one day-- "Hey, is this Coco Brown?" I'm like, "Yeah, this is she." They said, "Hey, Coco, we have a gig for you-- one day, 15 grand." I'm like, "I'll take it!" They said, "Great, Coco. And we'll give you 20 grand if you'll do anal." I said, "Excuse me? "What kind of comedy club is this? "I ain't never had to give no ass in no jokes. "What kind of shit is this? Has the game changed like that? Who the fuck changed the game?" They said, "No, we're lookin' for Coco Brown, the porn star." I said, "No, I'm Cocoa Brown, the comedian." They said, "Oh, we're sorry." I'm like, "No worries. "20 grand for anal, though." "Can I wear a mask? 'Cause my daddy a deacon. I don't need any problems, you know?" So if y'all happen to rent Big Booties of Death, Part Six, and y'all see a bitch in there like this, just know I did it for my child, you hear? I'm a single mother. You do shit for your child. I love being a mother. I do. All the mothers in the house, what's up? That's why I say I'm never bitter about my marriage. 'Cause the best thing in my life-- that little boy is the love of my life. I'm just at the age now where I love his innocence, you know? He's four years old. And I wear a lot of wigs. I like wigs. I keep 'em on heads in my closet and my baby think they're real people. He walk in the closet every day-- "Hi, everybody!" And just walk out. It makes my heart feel good knowing he love everybody. The only problem is, we done moved to Atlanta. And he got a lot of friends, you know, play for the other team. He come home talkin' to-- he talkin' like them now. I'm like, I don't know how to fix this. I'm like-- he watchin' Elmo on day. I'm like, "You like Elmo, baby?" "Yes! Yes! Elmo's giving me life, Mommy!" I'm like, "No!" They mad at me 'cause I got a four-year-old in a strip club. I'm like, "Look, you like titties. Look." Not that I wouldn't love my son if he was gay. I'm just trying to give him a fightin' start. But I'm a' tell you something, ladies. My mama always told me to test-- be a testimony. And the one thing I've learned is that men are not complicated, it's just us. See, we have to understand the mind of men. See, we want men to understand that we need certain things. But you're talkin' to 'em in the wrong language. See, men don't need a lot. You know what I'm saying? We're thinking they need all this extra shit to keep 'em happy. Men don't give a fuck about us shaving our eyebrows off and drawing 'em back on. They could care less. Most men only need a few things to keep 'em happy-- you feed 'em, you freak 'em, let 'em watch football, stay the fuck out of his space three days a week-- he's happy. Some of y'all sitting here-- "I don't understand what you're talking about." 'Cause your ass can't cook. If you're over the age of 20 and can't cook, bitch, kill yourself. I don't understand these new-age broads that can't even boil water. And they get mad at me, talkin' about, "I don't need to know how to cook. I look good." Right, but their body gonna drop one day. Better learn how to fry some chicken. And you ain't got to be a chef or no gourmet. Why? 'Cause these men are stupid. There's some men in here right now married to a chick he thought could burn in the kitchen, 'cause she put a slice of cheese on some ravioli and told his dumb ass it was lasagna. And ladies, you gotta understand that men don't cheat on us. You always worried about if a man gonna cheat on us. First of all, you have to understand this, ladies. Men don't cheat on us 'cause they don't love us. Men cheat because they're bored. Men have the attention spans of gnats. A man can say he love you at 3:00 and at 3:01, watch another ass walk by. It's just that quick. You up here trying to get his attention with stupid shit. You have to understand the mind of men, baby. It's one vein that connects their pride and their penis. You stroke the vein, you control the man. You stroke their dick, you stroke their ego. All this shit in the middle don't fuckin' matter. It's good that you feed your man. But most men don't care. You put a man in the desert, honey, and you give him a choice of booty or some water, he gonna take that booty. Why? 'Cause in his mind, booty got fluid. And ladies, don't worry about-- Men want something new. All men say the same thing-- "What's better than booty? New booty." So you have to recreate it. One of the best things you're gonna know how to do is role play. Role play allow you cheat on each other with each other without really cheatin'. See, know the man you're with. Some of y'all done role play the wrong shit. You don't know he beat bitches. You playin' Ike and Tina. Now you walkin' around with cake in your face, fucked up-- ♪ Rollin' ♪ Some of you play-- you want you a ball player. Wnat you a ball player, but you can't speak their language. So you talkin' about, come in here, tryin' to twerk and all this shit. No, speak their language. You want you a basketball player like Shaq? Then you know how to speak their language in the bedroom. Bring that shit in the bedroom. Know them plays, know them calls, so he feels you. When y'all in the bedroom gettin' it on, he say he want to bring another bitch in the bedroom-- "No, baby, mama only play one-on-one." If he get nasty and say, "I want you to lick my booty"-- "Nigga, that's a tech." If he come too quick, "Baby, that's a personal foul. That's on you." If you catch his ass goin' to another bitch' house-- "Nigga, you travelin'." You women got to teach your men. Some of these men don't know how to clean their plate and eat the booty right. See, men, let me explain something to you-- when you go back to front, that's a double dribble, nigga-- that's nasty. But when you eat it front to back, baby, that's a bucket. And women, step your game up, demand what you want. Some of y'all is appeased and cool with a nigga that just can dunk. No, I want a nigga that can hit a three-pointer from the half-court line. And if you know-- if your man loves football, baby, then you bring it in the bedroom too. When he comes upstairs after the football game, you be butt-naked on the bed with a football helmet on. Be down in a three-point stance. So when he come through the door, "Blue, 32! Blue, 32! Hut, hut, fuck!" And while y'all doin' it, you call shit out. When he try to put that shit in your face-- "Illegal motion." He try to make you lick some balls-- "Face mask!" He try to put that shit in your ass-- "Interception!" He starts choking you? "Holdin'! Personal foul. Unnecessary roughness!" He want to bring another bitch in the bedroom? "Off sides! Too many niggas on the field." Come on now. He say he about to come and you ain't get your shit yet? "Flag on the play! False start offense!" He start going downtown-- "On the 20, on the 10! He could go all the way! Touchdown!" You want some more? Red flag-- "Instant replay." Y'all, it's been real. I'm out. Come out, tryin' to tell dude to eat the cootie right. I don't know how to eat the cooch right. I'm sorry, I just-- if I'm down there, that's right enough. I don't eat coochie no more 'cause girls don't take-- they don't take baths like they used to. They shower. They don't let their coochie soak. They don't let it soak and get that funk out of there and that last nigga out of there. They sit up there and just hit the showerhead a couple of times. Then they think they clean. You don't have balls. Soak that monkey. You can't just get out the shower with a quick shower, thinkin' that shit fresh. You gotta get all inside. Men, we don't give a fuck. We suds it three times and we get the fuck out of there. There still be a little soap stuck on that motherfucker. But if you want me to eat that motherfucker, it better have no smell nowhere. And when I'm down there, I'm improvising. I don't know how to eat it right. I-- "Ahh ahh ahhhh." I might throw some shit in there. I might beat-box on it a little bit. My wife like, "What you tryin' to do? "Get a rap contract? Just lick it, motherfucker." I'm tryin'. You ain't tellin' me if I'm doing it right or not. But you know when you're doing it right when them legs close up on your head and you about to die. When you can't hear nothing no more, and them thighs turn into Beats by Dre, your ass better get the fuck out of there. This gentleman coming to you straight from Alexandria, Virginia, all the way on the other side of Brooklyn, New York. Show a lot of love. You know him and love him as Ashy Larry. But we all know him as Donnell Rawlings! "I'm on a new level." I love that song. That's hip hop. You ain't even got to say shit-- "I'm on a new level." They be arguin' with their self-- "I'm on a new level. I'm on a new level!" "Bought me a new shovel. Bought me a new shovel!" Hip hop-- five words, three verses, you can have a fuckin' hit. French Montana got a song-- "Ain't Worried About Nothin'." First verse-- "Nigga, I ain't worried about nothin'." Second verse-- "Nigga, I ain't worried about nothin'." Third verse-- "Nigga, I ain't worried about nothin', haaaa! Haaa!" I don't even know what the fuck "haaa" means. What do "haaa"? When would you even hear, "Haaa"? That sounds like some shit you hear, like, in a Southern Baptist church on a Sunday. ♪ Mmm, nigga, I ain't worried about nothin'. Haaaa! ♪ ♪ Ride, ride, work, that work, uh-work-ah ♪ ♪ Haaa! ♪ ♪ He ain't worried ♪ ♪ He ain't concerned! ♪ ♪ He has no fears ♪ ♪ And I ain't worried ♪ ♪ Look at God ♪ ♪ Won't He do it? Yes, He will. ♪ That's when it good-- that, "Look at God!" "God" come through your throat. ♪ Look at God! ♪ You worried? ♪ He ain't worried about nothin', ahhh! ♪ Up top, are y'all worried? They ain't worried about nothin'! And since none of y'all ain't worried, what I need you to do now is dig deep in your pocket and let Go-o-o-d know you ain't worried. Let my private jet know you ain't worried! Look at God. Won't He do it? Yes, He will! I'm worried. You know what I'm worried about? ISIS. I'm scared as shit of ISIS. I'm so scared of ISIS, when I have a conversation with people, I pay attention to every word they say in detail. I was talking to this guy today. He said, "Donnell?" I said, "What?" He said, "It is what it is." "It is what it is, nigga? "That's two 'is'es. You ISIS, nigga? "This nigga ISIS as shit. Fuck you talkin' about, 'It is what it is'?" I don't even try to spell Mississippi in public. Fuck that. One of my buddies-- he think ISIS is one motherfucker. He think it's one person. He like, "Fuck that nigga ISIS!" That ISIS Orlando shit-- that was fuck-- That wasn't-- that Orlando shit, that wasn't ISIS. They try to say he was a radical Islamic terrorist. He wasn't that. He was a radical gay terrorist. Omar was gay as shit. He had boyfriends up in the motherfuckin' club. He was a gay dude trapped inside of ISIS's body. He was confused. You can't be gay and ISIS, you know? You can't be gay and ISIS! You gotta pick one, motherfucker. You will never hear this conversation-- "Yo, you ISIS?" "Yaaaaas!" "You ISIS?" "Yaaas, bitch! Yaaaas! "Yaaas! It is what it is, bitch. "I'm ISIS, boo! I'm 'bout to blow you, boo!" Is this racist? No, not anything I said, what I'm about to say. You ever notice, every time somebody say, "Is this racist?", there's about to be some racist-ass shit. Like, if I see an Asian person, right? I see an Asian person, I'm like, "Where you from?" They're like, "Connecticut." "You know what the fuck I meant. Where is this shit right here from?" That's how all older Asian dudes walk. They all walk the same. Like they doin' the Shmoney dance-- "About a week ago!" I'm like, "You know what I meant. "What the fuck does Connecticut have to do with China? "I know you Chinese. What type of Chinese are you? "Are you Korean Chinese? "Are you Japanese Chinese? "Are you Filipino Chinese? Or are you Chinese Chinese?" This dude was like, "I'm Vietnamese. I'm not Chinese." I'm like, "That's a type of Chinese... to me, motherfucker." He was like, "Well, what type of black are you? Are you... That's how Africans are. Africans never blink. You ever seen an African blink? Never. As soon as they born, it's a surprise party for the rest of their fuckin' life. "Surprise, motherfucker." I play too much. I know I play too much. I was that motherfucker. You know, the one dude-- this motherfucker played way too much. Soon as you see him, you be like, "Come on, man. Not today with that bullshit. I'm a' fuck you up over those jokes." I was a funny dude in school. I didn't want to be funny when I was in school. You know what I wanted to be when I was in school? I wanted to be light-skinned. I wanted to be light-skinned and fine. Fuck funny. I wanted to be a light-skinned, fine motherfucker. When you light-skinned and you fine, you laugh different. Fine niggas laugh like this-- "Haaaa! Haaaa!" They alwas rubbing their head. They're like, "Haaa! Ahhhh!" Light-skinned niggas always look like the sun always in their face. They like this-- "Haaa! Haaa!" I wanted to be fine. I went out once with this girl. I had my fist balled up, right? I wasn't gonna hit her. I just wanted to let her know I was serious, right? I walked up to her. I did like this. She was like, "What?" I said, "What I look like?" She said, "What?" I said, "What I look like?" She said, "You look regular." "Regular, bitch? I ain't no gas station. What the fuck I look like? Am I fine or what?" "You look regular. You look regular." She started grabbing my face, taking it off, looking at it, throwing it back in my face. "You look regular! Ugh! Ugh! You look regular! Ugh!" When I was in school, you know what day I used to hate? I used to dread the day you had to read out loud. I used to hate that shit. I didn't want no part of that shit. I used to hate to read out loud. And I used to hate the motherfucker that used to like to read out loud. Like you, nigga. I know you couldn't wait to read out loud. You raised your hand-- "Is it time to read out loud?" We didn't even took our backpack-- "Is it time to read out loud?" Lookin' back at me like I'm a piece of shit. I used to hate to read out loud. And it wasn't I couldn't read. I just didn't want to lose my place. The worst shit to do is lose your place, especially when you play too much. Your whole class gonna fuck you up. And you know the dude that was about to fuck up when it was his turn. As soon as he opened the book, he'd be like this-- You like, "Oh my God! "We gonna be here all fuckin' day, man! "This kid almost had an asthma attack "off the first page, man! I want to go to fuckin' lunch!" You know the first word he say, he'd be like this-- he say, "Um..." You like, "Where the fuck is the 'um'? "Do anybody see-- I want to go to lunch, man! Fuck!" I used to hate when it was about to be my turn. I used to be like this-- "You know what? "If I don't make eye contact with my teacher, maybe she won't think I'm in the class." I used to be like this. She'd be like, "Donnell?" I could hear the whole class say, "Fuck!" "Come on, man! Somebody take his go, man. Just go for him, man!" I used to try to clear my throat to buy some extra time. I'd be like, "Ahem, ahem. Ahem, ahem, ahem." Here's my classmates-- shit, they'd be like, "Go!" They pushin' my back-- "Just go! Get it over with! Just go!" I like, "I'm a' go! Stop pushin' me!" "Go!" I used to put my finger on each word. I didn't give a fuck how long that shit took. I'd be like this-- "Ahem. Ahem, ahem." "Just go!" I'd be like, "Ahem. I..." I'd look up like I just read an encyclopedia off of one motherfuckin' letter. Baby, I was winnin'! I'd be like, "I told y'all I could read!" "Keep going!" I'd be like, "Ahem. I... "I... I buh... I buh..." They'd used to just laugh the same way you motherfuckers laughin'. Like I can't hear that shit. I'd be like, "I buh... "I buh-lieve... "I buh-lieve... "Ahem, ahem, ahem. "I buh-lieve "I believe the... "I believe..." Stop laughin' at me! "I buh-lieve the... "I believe the chil-drun... "I buh-lieve the... "I buh-lieve the children... "I believe "the children are... "I believe the children "are the... "I believe! The children are the..." I could hear niggas say, "Future, nigga! It's the greatest, nigga! You can't read!" I was the kid with the ruler. Remember the kid who had to have the ruler to line that shit up, so you wouldn't lose your place? If I didn't have the ruler, I would have never graduated out of high school. I had to take that shit line by line. "The other day when I went to the store, they said meet me by the fire station the other day." I didn't have no periods, no semi-colons. Fuck punctuation, nigga. I'm just trying to get to the end of this shit. "When you gonna put a period?" "When I run out of breath, motherfucker. "When I put a-- when I breathe, put a period right there!" Y'all, let you know real quick, man, I'm at the greatest point in my life. I just had a baby boy 10 months ago. Super excited. I'm happy as shit. I have a different respect for the vagina now. I was so disrespectful to the vagina. Not like Bill Cosby disrespectful. I just wasn't using the vagina for God's purposes. I was smashin' and dashin'. I didn't even like the word "vagina." If you'd have told me, "Donnell, I'm about to come over there and I'm a' bring this vagina..." "Vagina? I don't want no vagina. "I thought you was bringing that pussy over here. I thought you was bringing that wet-wet. I thought that was a Slip'N Slide. Having a baby is the greatest thing on earth. Having a baby is the greatest shit. Women are the greatest creatures on earth. Having a baby-- fellas, nine months. Nine months, something changin' your attitude, your hormones changin'. One minute you want this, one minute you want that. You don't know what the fuck is going on. One minute, you're like, "Honey, when you go out, can you get me a slice of pizza?" You come home with pizza, she be like, "Fuck pizza! "I want a double cheeseburger! "Large fries with a lot of ketchup. A lot of ketchup." Took me five months to realize how much "a lot of ketchup" was. I was getting fucked up every day with the wrong amount of ketchup. I came home with eight ketchup packets. She said, "Donnell, really? "Do that look like a lot of ketchup to you? Go get me a lot of ketchup!" I cursed that bitch all the drive. I'm like, "Bitch, get me a lot-- you see all these knots on my head? Fuck with this, 'little bit of ketchup'?" "How much is a lot?" "This many, bitch! Get me this many ketchups." I didn't know shit about the delivery room. I didn't even know I was in a delivery room. I thought I was in the room that you go to before you get to the delivery room. That lady was like, "Mr. Rawlings, you ready to have this baby?" I'm like, "In here, bitch? I just had a double cheeseburger, French fries and a lot of ketchup." I know one thing-- they violate your lady in the delivery room. They violate your lady. That day, anybody with a blue glove got to finger my lady. They didn't even have no name tags. They didn't even work at the goddamn hospital. Just put a glove on-- psshh pssshhh! "Psshhh-- you're not ready. I'm going to Starbucks. Anybody want anything from Starbucks?" I'm like, "I want an apology from this motherfuckin' hospital." I realized there's a couple of things you have to remember in the delivery room-- give her ice chips, back rubs, and lie. Lie about everything. I had my ice chips ready. As soon as she had a contraction, I was like, "Ice chips?" I had a backpack filled with ice chips. Ice chips and lies. I was lying about everything. I was lookin'-- I was like, "Baby, you know what? "After this, I'm gonna buy you some brand-new titties." I whispered it, 'cause her mother was there. I said, "I'm gonna buy you some brand-new titties." Listen, the only reason I offered her brand-new titties is 'cause my lady has a small chest, okay? You know it's small when I describe it as a chest. She was a 32 00 before she got pregnant. Talkin' about, "I'm thinking about breastfeeding." I'm like, "No, the fuck you not. "Not with them little tiny-ass titties. You better get some Enfamil, some Similac." This motherfucker tryin' to breastfeed. He can't latch on for shit. Look like he rock climbing and shit. I didn't want to watch the birth. I heard about the horror stories. I didn't want to watch. The only reason I thought about watching was 'cause her mother was watching and her mother was making it seem like it was the greatest shit she ever saw in her life. Her mother was like this-- "Aww! "Aw! Aw!" I don't know what the fuck "aw" mean. I don't remember the last-- I remember one time I used that in a sentence. It was like eight years ago. I was in this nightclub and at the end of the night, these two girls came up to me and said, "Donnell, we want to take you home and do some nasty shit to you." I said, "Aw!" "Look at God! Won't He do it? Yes, He will!" I finally went over there. I was nervous as shit. I heard it-- I looked and it didn't really look that bad. I was like, "Aw." This is how I started off. I started off like this. I thought he was in a gang fight. The first five seconds, he was like... I was like, "Look at God! Won't He do it? Yes, He will!" Y'all a great crowd. I'm Donnell Rawlings. Have a good night. Give it up for everybody you've seen so far. Give it up. Tryin' to get busy, man. Do what I do. Name is EarthQuake. Lavell: Put your hands together, ladies and gentlemen, for EarthQuake! Vegas, what's happenin'? No, I said, "Vegas, what's happenin'?" Uh, it's good to be down here. I'm glad to say y'all been-- it's good to be here. Last time I was down here, I was kickin' it with my boy Lamar Odom. Yeah, y'all laugh at the motherfucker. That nigga a genius. If you don't know what happened, Lamar Odom went to, you know, the bunny club, the brothel, fucked around and got clinically dead. They had to rush him to the hospital. He was dead. Everybody say he was stupid. I believe that nigga's a g-g-genius! 'Cause I would have did the same thing if you bring me a bill for some pussy for $75,000. I'm a' have a stroke too. "Ahh, ahh, ahhh! "You bitches got me trippin'. Ahh, ahh! "Ahh, ahh, ahhh! Uh, uh, fuck my credit card! "Get me an ambulance! Get me outta here!" That nigga's a genius. Some of y'all niggas ain't laughing. You have a stroke when your girlfriend asks you to help on that rent-- "Ahh, ahh, ahhh! 250? Ahh, ahhh!" That nigga was dead. I went the hospital. No vital signs or nothin'. Last will, the testament-- he was dead! We was right there cryin' and everything till Khloé Kardashian came in there, touched the nigga on his knee. That nigga just got up and started walkin'. I'm like, "These bitches be healin' a nigga! "I gotta get me some of this pussy. "If they can get a nigga to walk who was dead, they can help these bumps on my back." You gotta-- because the world, man-- you got to enjoy your life, man. Look what's going on-- Prince dead. DMX still alive. DMX took every drug in the medicine cabinet. Prince took one aspirin. Hip just gave out on his ass. Fuck goin' on in the world? I was in Cincinnati. You saw what happened to the goddamn gorilla. Mindin' his own motherfuckin' business. Just sittin' down there, mindin' his own mother-- Baby just came down there, dropped down. Shot the goddamn gorilla. "I know the gorilla personally." And they shot him. He like, "Fuck you shoot me for? "Why didn't you shoot them motherfuckers? "You should have shot the parents. "I was just babysittin'. I was watching the motherfucker better than you." I had to see the tape. Nigga, he was. He was just grabbin' him, like, "Shit, that's how my babysitter showed me how to swim. Come on, little motherfucker." I knew he was a little black kid, 'cause you know, everybody, PETA, got mad-- "Why you shoot the gorilla? "Why didn't you get some tranquilizer? Why didn't you have no tranquilizer, nothin'?" That's when Bill Cosby like, "I got somethin' for your ass. The shit I give him, boy, he'll let that baby go real quick!" That gorilla wake up in the morning-- "I knew I had a baby in this bitch. "My drawers are gone, my ass is hurtin' and there's just a script of The Cosby Show." Fuck y'all, that's funny. Bill Cosby gonna go to court, acting like he blind and shit. Get your ass in there! You can see! Like, he blind mellow Jell-O. Get your ass in there, nigga! Talkin' about, now you a blind-ass motherfucker? You can see. You can't see, nigga? Can you hear? Guilty, nigga! Guilty! Just round here rapin' women. Goin' to the club, talkin' about, "Are we fuckin' "or am I fuckin'? After you drink this! Hey, hey, hey!" Just fuckin' puddin' up, nigga. He done fucked puddin' up. You don't even trust puddin' no more. Just give him chocolate Pudding Pops when the motherfucker don't even want one. I always wanted to know when I went to the club, who came up with Jell-O in motherfuckin'-- just putting alcohol in Jell It was Bill Cosby. This nigga's a genius! You put Jell-- alcohol in motherfuckin' Jell-O. And I'm telling you right now, I got to do something. I got to find me a woman. I swear to God. Yeah, 'cause this transgender shit got a nigga shook! I go to the bathroom now, and I go in there-- "Who in there? "Before I pull my dick out, who you and what you? "I need a roll call before I pull my dick out. "Fuck it, I'm pissin' outside. Who you and what you?" I don't give a fuck you laugh or not. I ain't pulling my dick out. I want to know who in the bathroom. I see some of y'all ain't laughing. These ain't jokes. I love women-- flamin' hair-- I love women. But this transgender shit got a nigga shook. I didn't even know what no transgender was, nigga. I graduated from public school. When they say transgender, I thought they was talkin' about some new Transformer movie. I'm like, "I can't even wait for this motherfucker to come out!" My daughter like, "Naw, Daddy, they transform, but not like that." Shit, this Transformer got a nigga shook. I ain't lyin' to you. I didn't even know what it is. So I say, well, my daughter say, "If you want to know what a transgender is, "all you got to do is see Caitlyn Jenner. "She gonna be on ESPYs. Watch her and you'll know what a motherfuckin' transgender is." I say, "Well, let me look and see what it is." 'Cause I don't want to slip up, bring the wrong motherfucker home. I might have to upgrade my playa card. You know what I'm sayin'? So I found it-- seen her on ESPN. She came on-- Caitlyn Jenner. I turned it on, saw her. I saw her, like, "Ooh, that's an ugly-ass white woman. "I'm safe! I never fuck with her." And she still talk like she Bruce. And walk like her too-- this heavy-foot-ass bitch. I don't fuck with no bitch. This bitch just be stompin' and like-- Bitch, pick your feet up. I don't mind you slidin' your feet, but, bitch, pick your feet up. This transgender got a nigga shook. I'm serious, nigga. I need a woman now, nigga. Fuck that. I just go back to when I was young. I go finger 'em again. "Let me see what you is. Yeah, you a woman. Okay. How you doin'?" I got to go-- uh, go back to fingerin' 'em again, nigga. I don't know what no transgender is. But after seein' Caitlyn Jenner, I say, I'm safe. I can keep on pickin' up women like I used to. 'Cause I never fuck with no ugly motherfucker like that. Then I went to a non-profit organization for my girl Alicia Keys. That's my baby. She got this non-profit organization called, you know, Pediatric AIDS. And there's a black-tie affair. So you know, any time you go to any non-profit organization, benefits, other people who have their own foundation are there too, 'cause they're there to solicit donations, 'cause they know the money is there. So I'm in there, chillin' at the table, kickin' it with Russell Simmons, askin' this nigga what's up with my RushCard? 'Cause I still ain't got my $250 back, nigga. So we-- we just sittin' there, chillin' and everything. And this beautiful, fine-ass model-- I mean, this bitch is drop gorgeous, 10, came over the table. She was like, "Excuse me? I'd like to solicit a donation for my foundation." I was like, "Hell, yeah! "I don't give a fuck what it is-- Save a Whale, "Let a Monkey Live-- bitch, you got that money. Bitch, I'll write the check." So I got my checkbook out, but I don't know what her foundation is. I had to ask. I said, "What is your foundation?" She said, "My foundation is Stop Abuse and Bullying of Transgenders." I was like, "Ooh, that's you?" My dick went down and my pen came out. I was like, "Ooh, I was gonna fuck that bitch too." She could have got me. Ooh, this motherfucker don't look nothin' like Bruce. I was like, "Man, I gotta change my game now. These motherfuckers are impressive." So when I meet a woman now, I don't want to know your name, your phone number, none of that shit. If I'm attracted to you, the first question out of my mouth is this-- "Are you organic? "Did yo mama name you Lisa? "If she named you Lisa, it's good to meet ya. "If she named you Keith, bitch, we gonna have beef. "'Cause if I take you home and both of us got a sword, somebody got to die." Fuck that, I'm talkin' the shit out of you, man. My friends ain't gonna never let me live this shit down. I see some of y'all ain't laughing. I don't give a fuck. These ain't jokes. And I ain't-- I don't have nothin' against gay people. Don't be talkin' about Quake bein' gay. I'm talkin' my preference. I am a flamin' heterosexual man. I need my woman in her original carton. She can have some extra add-on, but you need to come in your original carton, motherfucker. And I ain't got nothin' against gay people or nothin'. I love gay men, 'cause the more gay men in the world, that's more women for me. A matter of fact, one day, nigga, I dreamed all you niggas turned gay. And I was the only motherfucker around here with a dick. It was like Powerball, nigga. I had to have a drawing for my dick every Tuesday and Thursday, nigga. It was beautiful. "Give me that winning-ass ticket! 15, 18, 25, 17." I ain't got nothing against gays or shit. Be whatever you gonna be. I'm tellin' you my preference. My preference is with women. And I'm-- I'm a strong advocate for women. I don't understand how anybody or anything give up the love of some pussy. I don't know how gay men give up that pussy. Nigga, you need to try that shit one more time. You need a second opinion. 'Cause I ain't never had no bad pussy. I had some good pussy, but never bad. I'll work with you. Especially if I drove all the way over there. We gonna work this out, nigga. I don't give a fuck you a lazy fuck or not. You ain't got to lift your legs. Just stay right there. Stay right there. There it is. There-- ahhh! You ain't got to worry about me. I ain't gonna keep you up long. 'Cause I can't fuck past a commercial. I got one, two, maybe three strong strokes, nigga. Hmm! Hmm! Ahhh! Ooh, you was outstanding. Ooh, God damn. Look how your legs makin' my legs shake like that. You ought to call your pussy the Tranquilizer. She like, "You through?" "You heard me say, 'Mmm!' That's it." "I'm not satisfied!" "Hey, you said you was independent. Play with yourself." These ain't jokes. Got to find you a good motherfucker. I just-- understand, I just love women. And you can't talk about gay men no more like that, man. Shit. I went to Atlanta. All the peaches are gone. Ain't nothin' but plums down in that bitch. And they ain't no fragile motherfucker-- they some big motherfuckers like... Nigga whoop your ass, then take your ass. I'm talkin' about, them niggas huge, in shape. That's why you got to take-- make sure you take care of your motherfuckin' self. And another thing I say for my black people. We got to change our mentality when it comes to these motherfuckin' cops. Some black people mad at Barack about police brutality. Talkin' about Barack ain't doin' enough. "Come on, Barack. We voted for you. Do something, Barack. Yeah." Black people mad at the police, police mad at black people. Some black people mad at Barack-- "Come on, Barack." Barack like, "Shit, nigga, "they jumpin' the fence on my house. It's every nigga for them self." I have to teach my people-- and I'll tell you something about the police, you gotta understand-- the police are one of the most, if not the most powerful people we have in our judicial system. I understand we walkin' around here marchin'-- Black Lives Matter and all that. But we-- some of us act like we don't watch Law & Order. And I say by Law & Order, the police have privilege no other occupation have. They can use deadly force based on their presumption of the fear. And it is your responsibility when you meet that nigga to make him feel comfortable. He has a gun and the right to use deadly force based on his presumption of the fear. And it is your responsibility to make sure that motherfucker is comfortable. You do it when you in the motherfuckin' hood if a nigga pull a gun out. He pull a gun out-- "Go ahead, nigga. You got it. I didn't even know it was like that." He can use it. That's why you always hear when they kill one of us, first thing they say-- "I feared for my life." That's the get-out-of-jail card. 'Cause he can use that 'cause he feared for his life. I don't allow that nigga to play that card with me. I don't fuck with police. When the police pull me over, nigga, I get out of my car and go sit in the backseat of his car. "Where's your license and registration?" "Go ahead, nigga, find it for yourself. "Nigga, I'm stayin' right here. I ain't fuckin' with you. "And I got my own handcuffs. "I know they got fur on 'em, but, bitch, I ain't never broke out these motherfuckers in my life." I don't play with the police. 'Cause I understand. They have the most power. They got more than the judge that give you the death penalty. Judge leaves it-- the judge give you the death penalty, nigga, you have a right to appeal. You have no right to appeal on the side of the road when that motherfucker feel you are a threat. You do not put him in that motherfuckin' position. And you tell that motherfucker, "I ain't fuckin' with you." I don't-- hey, listen. You can say what you is. I'm trying to tell you how you live. You go on and play with the motherfuckers if you want to. You fuck around, be a hashtag out here in these fuckin' streets. I don't play with 'em. I teach my son that. When you get pulled over, I want you to act like you a Martian comin' to Earth for the first time. "What should I do, Daddy?" As soon as they pull you over, "Take me to your leader!" Act like you stunned. Nahhh. And black people, you can't be loud and wrong at the same time. If your ass is dirty, this is not the time to be talkin' shit to the police. Now I'll be drinkin' sometime, police pull me over. Nigga, I don't try no celebrity shit. When police pull me over, I use my Color Purple card. White cop pull me over-- "Have you been drinkin'?" "No, sah! "Never let it touch ma tongue! "Just the taste of it makes me sick, sah! ♪ Hmm, hmm, hmm! O Jesus. ♪" But you ain't puttin' me in no cage. You ain't puttin' me in no cage. I-- I can't go to jail. I can't even stay in my room an hour. They say black people don't snitch. Shit, I do! You catch me, nigga, you caught us. Fuck First 48 hours, nigga. I'm snitchin' in 42 seconds. Soon as they come in with the lineup-- "Do you recognize--" "Oh, that's Eddie, "but that's an old-ass picture. "Bring me a piece of paper and a pencil. "I'll show you how the nigga look at the time of the murder. "Yeah, that's Eddie right there. "That's him right there. That's where it is. I put the gun in his hand and everything." I been a snitch all my life, nigga. I been snitchin' since I been 12 years old. I remember, my mother came home from work, say, "I'm gonna whoop everybody ass in the house till somebody tell me who broke my lamp." I like, "No need to hit me. "Matter of fact, grab the belt and meet me in the kitchen. "'Cause the shit I'm about to tell you, "you gonna cook me somethin' to eat! "I'm gonna tell you about these ungrateful-ass kids you got, Mama, "in this house, while you out here workin' hard "tryin' to provide a good livin' for us. "You mind puttin' a little cheese in them eggs right there "while you scramblin' them up? "I'll tell you who broke your lamp. "It was your oldest daughter. "'Cause she had a nigga in here, Mama. They was fuckin' all in your house." Yeah, I snitched on her ass. She givin' up pussy, ain't even had this nigga bring me nothing to eat. What kind of sister is you? You givin' up pussy, everybody in the house is supposed to be happy. You know, this nigga blowin' your back out and your little brother is hungry. Who raised you? Some of you women ain't laughing. 'Cause you givin' up pussy now and you behind on your rent. Ah, don't get mad at the messenger. If you givin' up pussy, you supposed to have your bills paid. If a nigga is blowin' your back out, hittin' your head up in the back of the motherfuckin' headboard, you are sore from suckin' his shit, you supposed to have your bills paid! And I'm a' tell you how you do it. Invite that motherfucker over to the house, cook him something to eat, pour him a drink-- "Y'all having a good time?" There's foreplay, he kissin' all on you, you kissin' all on him, and then he take his clothes off, you take your clothes off. And then when he jump over and jump on you and ready to hit it, just before he penetrate, you just roll over. He like, "What's wrong?" You like, "This rent! I just can't concentrate 'cause of this rent!" See y'all later. Good night. ♪♪
