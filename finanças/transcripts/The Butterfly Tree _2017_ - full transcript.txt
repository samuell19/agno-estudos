Mm-hm. But those were the clincher. You slept with me for my food? Absolutely! Do you wanna take some lunch? I think there's some leftover chops in the fridge. Sure. OK. There you go. Did you have someone over last night? No. Alright, I need you to do me a favour. Can you call work and tell them I'm running late? See you later, ok? Uh-oh. Sprung! Now you think I'm a scurvy dog going through your things. Don't be silly. There's a sign, you see? I know someone who might like the display case, that's all. - Be my guest. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Thanks. Can I give you a hand? Um… Yeah, my… My keys. It's the square silver one. Yep. Thanks for that. You two look great together. Could still pull it off. You think? I have an imagination. No… I can't. Not right now. I'm already late for work. Another 15 minutes won't make a difference. Tomorrow? OK. Tomorrow. I take a break at 11:30. Um… you could have some cake. - Cake? - Yeah. Look, um… I don't mean to brag, but, uh… I've got some cakey tricks of my own. - Oh! - Yeah. Cakey tricks? Tomorrow? - Tomorrow. - OK. Come in! I, uh, thought you were closed. Oh, no, it just looks like it. Come on in. Are you looking for anything in particular? Just flowers. OK. The lilies are pretty. Um… the roses are always safe. Is there a special occasion? Oh, no. Just for mum. Oh, you're a nice boy, buying flowers for your mum. It's her birthday. I'm impressed you remembered! What colour do you think she'd like? I think pink, probably. The tulips are a personal favourite of mine. She likes tulips. They always look so pure. They're amazing. Come with me. I wanna show you something. Come. The cymbidiums flower every two years. You have to look closely. Your nose almost has to touch it. See that? I wish I could take a photo. Turn around. Close your eyes. Hold out your hand. - What is it? - Hold out. There you go. - Can I open? - Yeah. It's yours. Really? Would you like a lesson? - Yeah. - OK. Very easy. All you do is point at the subject. OK, now, there's no zoom, so you just use this here to focus. And click. It's a little bit of a dinosaur, so you wind it on manually. Oh! Your lucky last. I'll just change the roll. Do you live close by? Not far. You're all set. OK. Pens down. Let's see what you've got. Sarah. Let's share it. I fight, I pine why does the sun shine? He speaks, I drown nothing sought, nothing found obsessed with beauty and treasure within "open sesame," said Aladdin a thousand and one tales a language divine… And that's it. Hmm. That's good. - Well done. I like that. - Thank you. He, um… "He speaks…" - I drown. - I drown. - Yeah. - Oh, it's nice. Um… Shelley? Withered flesh and sagging little breasts something about an older man that makes me want to self-combust, self-destruct… I want to know what it's like to Sully oneself with 50-plus lust watery sperm and carefree germs running free on mr wrinklee. Thank you, shelley. OK, people, uh, we're… We're done for today. Remember, for homework, to keep your… Keep your journaling up and for next week, remember to bring in, um, an… an image from childhood that resonates with you. Uh… No. No. No. For chrissake, just let me pay for this. Yes. Credit card. Oh, no. It looks good on you. Thank you. - I'm Evelyn, by the way. - I'm Fin. - Nice to meet you, Fin. - Nice to meet you too. Would you like a job? A Jo… yeah! Yeah, yeah, sure. - Check with your mum first? - Yeah. I… she'll be cool. No, no, she will. She'll be happy to get rid of me. - Is tomorrow too soon? - No, no. I… I can come round, like, 8:00, 8:30. Oh, no, no, no. That's too early. 9:30's better. I hate mornings. - I'll see you then. - See you then. - OK.

Hmm. You're right but only by a smidge. Told you. Do you know how much I love you? Mwah. You're a gorgeous boy. Hey? - Morning. - Hey, you. Is that your dad's new girlfriend? No. Oh… I don't know. She's sexy. Is he ok? Who? Your dad. Yeah, I… I guess. Yeah, I… Thanks for doing this. Wait. I've got something for you. Do you have any of those? No. I don't. I did some research. They like banana and apple. Great. Thank you. No problem. - I, uh… I gotta go. - OK. - 'Bye. - 'Bye. He's a beauty. It's a she. Your mum would've liked her. Hey, I got you a present. What is it? It's in the boot. Do you want to give me a hand? Come on. Where'd you get it? You know the flower shop? Yeah, there's a new owner. I met her yesterday. She seems nice, eh? Do you want to grab that end? Yeah. Hey, what have we got here? - Whoa! Hello! - Oh, dad… - Where'd you get these? - Gary. Gary? Gary. I mean, they are… Look, mate, they're a great set, there's no doubt about it, but not something I want ending up at school. No way I want you wanking over them. What?! Mate, that's a bit rough. Come in. Lyn! Allan. How are you? Um, yeah, I'm fine. There's been some gossip. Don't ask me how I heard it. That's not important. What is important is that you tell me the truth. Once I know the truth then we can do something about it, hm? Have you been having an affair with a student here? No. Just a moment. That's ok. We're finished here. Go on with your meeting. Oh! Yummy! Stop. Don't… don't touch that. She looked scary. Are you in trouble? No. Well… …I can tell that you have been a very naughty boy, and I want you to come with me before they shoot you! What are those? These, my dear friend, are cock-o-rings. Go, show me your 'o' mouth. Oh! Oh! Oh! Ohhhh! You can't be serious. I am serious, it literally took me, like, hours to come up with these. Shelley… I can't be doing this. When are you gonna lighten up? It's ok. You're scared. Scared that I'd dob you in, scared you'd lose your job and there'd be a public outcry. I get it. Don't worry. But I promise that is never gonna happen. Look, I won't even touch you. No pressure. I'll just… I'll just wait. Can you just try them on? Oh, my god. I have my money on lucky number… One. What is wrong?! This. This. I mean, it's… it's… It's just… You know, it's just not appropriate. Do you have any idea how much I fucking hate that word? 'Appropriate'? We both know what is not appropriate. Someone in your position using it to take advantage. - Are you blackmailing me? - Call it what you want, Allan. You started this, and I think it's extremely rude to start something that you can't finish. Shelley, it was never my intention to hurt you. Please! Do you want me to vomit? Is that what'll get you off? OK. Look, it's… Let's finish it. - Let's finish this. - What? It's finished. It's finished, ok? There we go. Are you happy now? Jesus! Look at that thing. - Mmm. - Oh, my god. What, you trying to kill yourself? No pictures. Not like this. - They'll put me in jail. - Oh, come on. - You look cool. - You think? Yeah. Way cool. Can you do any tricks? - Maybe. - Maybe? - Can you skate? - No. No. You want me to teach you? Show me some actual tricks and I'll think about it. Oh, actual tricks? Really? - Well, maybe I don't know any. - You don't know any? - Mmm. OK. - Not one? Alright. This is a make. - Whoo! - Whoo! And this is a waltz jump. - Ha-ha. - Alright, alright. This is a two-footed spin. Whoo! Yo, skater girl! Thank you. Mmm. - But that was so last century. - Oh, really? We need something new. Something interesting. - Like what? - Like a jump. Like a ramp. Hey, don't you turn me into no skater dude. Hell, no, sister. You're the derby queen. - Derby queen. - Yeah. Alright, I'll tell you what. You clear this and I'll give you my entire life savings. - Which is? - Which is… - $8.20. - Wow! - It's a lot of money. - Mm-hm. - Double it. - Like I said, lady, that's it. That's, er… That's all I got. OK, I'll double it, but here's the deal. You lay down, face up, eyes open, no blinking. - Make it a 20. - OK, great. Perfect. - Deal. - You're on. - No blinking. - Alright. Lay down.

When I was a little girl - well, not really little - I became obsessed, I mean obsessed, with why men had nipples. There had to be some evolutionary purpose, right? So you see here. Look. Beetle feeders. - Beetle feeders? - Yeah. You see, that's a man's nipple. It's a beetle feeder. That's all they're good for, really, is feeding beetles. Ants use their antennae to stroke the aphids to let down their milk. As do the stag beetles to your nipple. It's called a symbiotic relationship. We should start the day like this every day. Getting wasted? Or on rollerskates? - With a secret. - A secret? Yes. You know, there isn't really much to tell. - I'm pretty boring really. - Oh, I don't think so. OK, I'll go first. As my mother used to say… "Evelyn, you have loved well but not wisely." I spent half my life saying yes to men I didn't really love. Well, maybe you just needed to, you know, break a few eggs. Mum used to say that. You've got to break a few eggs before you find a good one. I want to meet your mum. I actually don't have a mother. Not anymore. I'm sorry, Fin. I didn't… It's ok. She must have been a good mum. - So it's just you and your dad? - Yeah. Yeah, him and his girlfriends. Oh, he's here already. Evie? Evie, open the door. Evie, let me in. Open the door. - You need to leave, Vince. - Open the door. - Evie, I… Evie! - You're violating police orders. - Evie, open the fucking door. - I don't give a shit. Dvo or no dvo, we have nothing left to say to each other. Evie, I made a mistake. Evie, I made a mistake. I'm sorry. Yes, hello. It's Evelyn Gray. My ex-husband's trying to break in. He's breaking a dvo. Oh, my god. - That's the guy I invited over. - What? No, no, no, no.

What's… What happened to you? A lot. A lot happened, shelley. Everything happened and I can't… I can't undo it. I can't fix it and I can't… Um… It's your lucky day. I like you, Fin. Actually, I've got something for you. Another present? It's, uh, just a thank you for the camera. With a ribbon and everything. Evelyn, are you alright? I'm ok. It's just been a bad day. It's ok. You should go. I don't want them to see you here. - You sure? - Go. Goodbye. Um… Fin, right? Hi. Shelley. - Hi. - Um, I just, uh… Can you give your dad these, please? Um… he needs a bit of cheering up. Fin, can we talk? Fin? - Hello? - Evelyn, it's Fin. Oh, hey, Fin. I'm just in the bath. I'll get dressed. - Are you ok, Fin? - Yeah. Come in. - You're not hurt, are you? - No. Do you reckon it would be alright if I stay here for a little while? Does your dad have a girlfriend? I just need a bit of time to sort a few things out. You need to call him, Fin. He'll be worried. No. Hello? Yes, this is her. Yes, I did. No. Yes, I know where to go. Thank you. Do you think I could have a hug? I'm not very well, Fin. You should go. Dinner! Come on, Fin! This is getting ridiculous. Alright, well, I'll put it in the microwave and you can sort it out yourself. Fin? Fin? Oh, for fu… Evelyn? Jesus! Have you broken something? Hey, are you ok? Come on. Let's get you to a doctor. Can you stand? Are you fucking your student? - Who told you that? - Are you? I fucked up. But they're… You know, they're mistakes that I'm… …That I'm trying to undo. How's it going for you? Ow! Good… I hope. 'I hope'. Sounds encouraging. OK. Hey? Hey, you don't have to like me… Good! …But at least let me give you a lift to a doctor. Look, I don't want a doctor. I just want to go home. Well, then I'll take you home. OK. - Ow. - OK. - Oh! - You alright? OK, let me get that up. OK. No, I'll… I'll do it. I'm going to be really gentle, alright? OK. - Ow! - Sorry. Aha! What would we do without frozen peas? Here. Can I get you a cup of tea? I just need my pills on top of the fridge, if you don't mind. - In the green container. - Yep. And a glass of water. - Sure. - Thanks. That's a lot of pills. You need a lot of pills if you're a hypochondriac. - Ah. Thank you. - No problem. Um… Fin? Hey! Hey! Those photos. Did you take 'em? Jesus, Fin. You can't… - You can't stay there. - What are you gonna do? Maybe I'll call the cops and they can ask her. Go your hardest, and while you're at it, are you going to tell them you fuck your students? - OK. It's up to you. - Fuck… Tell me what's going on or I'll ask her myself. Get your class to move in. You can fuck them all. - You watch your mouth. - Stay away. - I'm not going to stay… - Stay the fuck away! Fin! Fuck! Evelyn? Evelyn? Hello. You've reached bloom. Please leave a message. Hi, Evelyn. It's Al. Um… um… Yep. Yes? How can I help? Mrs Evelyn… miss Evelyn Gray. Is she here? Yes, she has checked in, but it's not visiting hours until three o'clock. Oh, ok. Thank you. Yes. - Lyn! - I'll keep this brief. This was handed in to me today. Now, you tell me, do I need to get that developed? Probably not. Well, then I think it's best you pack up your things and go. Oh, Allan, I did try. Are you in trouble? Big trouble? Is there anything I can do to help? What? Stay away. Just stay away. Fin, I know you're in there. Look, I don't want any more trouble. I just want to talk. That's all, ok? Fin? No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Oh, fuck! No! Fuck! Fin! Fin! Fin! Come on, I need help! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck. Fuck! Fuck. Fuck! Ahh! Fuck! Evelyn? - Why did you do that? - What? Your hair. It was going to fall out anyway. I'll grow it back. Where are your clothes? This is what you wear in hospital, Fin. - It's ugly. - Yeah, but it's practical. I hate practical. I… I liked you the way you were. I can't be the way I was before. Why? - I don't feel the same. - Why? Evelyn, you are the most beautiful woman I have ever met. Are you going to die? Fin? Get out of my room. Get the fuck out of my room. - Mate, who do you think you are? - Well, you're the arsehole. I'm the arsehole? Well, I'm just the arsehole that pays for everything. Are you going to do that too now that I've lost my job? Hey, whether you like it or not, you don't control my life. And if I want to date a woman or whatever, then I will. You're just going to fuck her up! Just like mum. Take it back. Look, your mother did what she did. It was her choice, Fin. Not mine. How would you know? You weren't there! Dad? Dad. Dad! Dad! Dad! Hello, Fin? Fin? It's ok, I know you won't pick up. If you are there, there may be some cash under my jocks in the top drawer. Order yourself a pizza. OK. 'Bye. - Hi. - Hi. Why didn't you tell me? You sweet creature. There's some things you're better off not knowing. Like about you and dad? You never told me he was your father. Yeah, well, I wish he wasn't. Did he… …And you? Come here. I want to tell you something. I want you to talk to your father. Will you do that for me? I made this for you. That's beautiful. Hey. Hi. Brought you some clothes. Thanks. Did you get my message? Yeah. What did you tell them? I told them that my son tried to kill me. No, I just made something up. Are you hungry? Do you want some of this? It's hospital food. No, this is good. Here. Come on. Try the sausage. My love, I can feel it coming and I can't go back there again. I'm sorry but I don't want you to suffer more than you already have. Please forgive me. Take care of our gorgeous boy.
