[MUSIC PLAYING] Excuse me, sir, but are you an American? Hey, man, can you lend me a dollar until the New Left takes over? Get a job, you bum. She went that way. [MUSIC PLAYING] Very clean girl, sir. Practically a virgin. Special price, $15. $10? $5? [GRUNT] [MUSIC PLAYING] [OUTBOARD MOTOR] [MONKEY SQUEALS] [BIRD SHRIEKS] Shh. Schmuck! [MONKEY SHRIEKING] [KNOCKING ON THE DOOR] PETER: (OUTSIDE) Dave. Dave! [KNOCKING] Hey, Dave! DAVE: Go away. I don't like to be disturbed while I'm meditating. Ow! Dave? DAVE: It's the mosquitoes, mate. You're a very mean little girl. You don't understand? Do you love me? How would you like it if I took you to Orchard Road and had a new dress made for you? Oh Dave, I love you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mercenaries. I'm surrounded with mercenaries. I thought I heard a knock. You're leading [INAUDIBLE]. What do you think I've been doing out here all these years? Take my advice. Do whatever you're doing for that oil company, then you go home. Don't you miss too many ships. I'll make with the company, but I'm staying on here in Singapore, where life's too sweet. Scent and sound of the Orient. 15 million cash registers going clink, clink, clunk. That's sweet. I'm not going to park my frame behind a desk in Auckland for the rest of my life. Look what I ended up with. A lot of bad memories, and this lousy barge. This barge and me. Sum and substance. But you've done it all. DAVE: Done what? Action in two wars, 10,000 $10 girls. PETER: And had a brilliant career in journalism. DAVE: My byline in a dozen fading magazines. I've had it, John. I'm washed up. I'm a loser. You love me? You love me? What about my new dress? Later. I love you. Hey, now you see why you better not miss too many ships? Try $15 Malaysian. That's $5, US. Mr. Dearborn. Mr. Dearborn, may I speak to you? You mind? I've got a business to run here. I've got a busted generator. The toilet's backed up. -It's urgent. Please. Huh. Here. Make it quick. We got a maiden waiting. My card. Yeah, so? I want you to do a story for me. What kind of a story? Something on the activities of a certain Chinese businessman named Lim Tek Sing. I'm retired. Any hack out here can do that job. Any hack can't do the job. We want more than just surface information. A lot more. I couldn't get you his telephone number. You could get a lot more than that. His current concubine, girlfriend, whatever you want to call her, is a woman named Foon Mai Lee. I believe you know her. Foon Mai Lee. She's in Singapore? At the Raffles Hotel. [OUTBOARD MOTOR] Cheer up, buddy. We'll spend the whole night at Joe's Pleasure Paradise. My shout. Including penicillin? You're in a lousy mood. Stop bugging me. Can't you find another playmate? PETER: I'm just trying to be helpful. I don't want help. I'm drowning in a sea of friends. Mystic white virgins. What I want is an enemy. When you hate somebody, you know where you stand. -Dave-- -Shut up. Let me think, will ya? I'm sorry. What's wrong with the generator now? Brushes. I need a new set. Last week it was the armature. The junk's falling apart. I'm falling apart. -You still love her? -Shut up. Dave-- All right, I'm still hung on her. When I had her, I hated her. Now she's gone, I miss her. Listen, Pete, you can do me a favor. You go see her. Make sure everything's all right with her. Tell her I said hello. PETER: You go. No, you go. If Lim gets the idea I'm back in the picture, he'll kick her out on her ass. But be discreet. No sooner said than done. Don't try to screw her. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CAR HORN] OK, Go give my regards to the dragon lady. I go to the more mundane task of generator maintenance. Good luck with the brushes. [MUSIC PLAYING] Tell her I still love her. [MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKING] Wait a minute. [KNOCKING] I'm coming. [KNOCKING] (INSIDE) I'm coming. Yes? I'm a friend of Dave Dearborn. I don't know a Dave Dearborn. [SIREN] [MUSIC PLAYING] Excuse me, sir. I'm hitchhiking through Asia on my school holiday, broadening the mind, you know. I wonder if you could you help me out. I haven't eaten in three days. [INTERPOSING VOICES] [INTERPOSING VOICES] [MUSIC PLAYING] Excuse me, please. Hi, Dave. I surrender, maiden. You know, the CIA won't search for me for six months? I can't shake you for an hour. You tell me you came here. Would you care to join me for a drink? That is, if you're not too busy. No. [MUSIC PLAYING] Listen, do you follow me because you love me? I hoped you'd get around to that subject. DAVE: Do you? Yes, I love you. Do normal American girls visit the object of their affections in a whorehouse? It's not listed in the guidebooks that way, but that's what it is. I am very broad-minded. DAVE: Broad-minded. Yes. DAVE: Aware. Yes. Well, then you're aware that this is a whorehouse for homosexuals. No! [LAUGHS] Dave, buy me a drink. This is fun. [MUSIC PLAYING] You said you just wanted to talk to Peter. Well, he hangs out here. I'm waiting for him. [MUSIC PLAYING] Take me home. Oh, you lied. You said you'd do whatever I want. OK, I want you to enjoy yourself. [MUSIC PLAYING] OK, I'll enjoy myself. Hey, sock it to me, baby! [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [WHISTLES] Cool it, baby. [MUSIC PLAYING] Can't you talk to Peter tomorrow? I'll tell you what. I'll talk to him tomorrow. It wasn't important, anyhow. I'm having fun. You're having fun. Everyone's having fun! Are we, Dave? Yeah. Never mind. What? Never mind! [WHISTLES] [MUSIC PLAYING] $20 Malay is $3 American. Still more than they got. You know what? You're drunk. You know what? I am. Dave, how'd you like my new act? Well, it has its points. Well, that's the silicone. Well, can I get you something to drink? Oh, no. No, I have to go sit with some oil company biggie. I hope his checks are as good as his bullshit. Aren't you going to introduce me, Dave? Bonnie, this is Cynthia Jordan, my niece. Your niece? Your niece? My niece. Oh. Well, it was very nice to meet you. You better hang on [INAUDIBLE]. Trying to get him on the [INAUDIBLE] for two years now. But he doesn't go for round eyes. He's just one of my customers. Oh, yeah? Well, that's your gig you're going to starve waiting for him to pay. Hey, why don't you give me a call tomorrow? I've got a whole peck full of $50 jobs. [INAUDIBLE] likes money. She's just pulling your leg. Pulling my leg? Hey, she'd make a mint in this town with that face. Really-- no, really, call me when you're tired of giving it out for nothing. For nothing? I got $20 Malay. Listen, has Peter been in? Who's-- oh, Peter, the QE kid, right. Well, you better try Duskaro. We're too expensive for him. Hey, don't you wear your uncle out. He owes me one. And hey, why don't you-- why don't you come over and see me sometime? I'll [INAUDIBLE]. I am not your niece. I know. Fine, I'm taking you home. You're not taking me. I'm having fun. Let's go dancing. I tell you what-- let's go dancing. [MUSIC PLAYING] Wait a minute. I don't want to wait. I want to dance. I want to call Peter. [PHONE RINGING] DAVE: (ON PHONE) Hey, Pete! Peter? VOICE: (ON PHONE) I am after you, David. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, what's this crush you've got on Peter? Shut up. Come on, let's go. [MUSIC PLAYING] Did you see Peter? Not tonight. [INAUDIBLE]. Bring me a scotch. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMING] Dave, what's the matter? Hey. Come on, let's go home. [MUSIC PLAYING] [OUTBOARD MOTOR] Peter! Well, Dearborn. We've established the cause of death was strangulation. Indian lasso, we think. Now, if this was so, it's most unusual for Singapore. Anyway, we've managed to keep the affair out of the papers, and I hope we can proceed with our investigation [INAUDIBLE]. Now, you say that you last saw the deceased yesterday afternoon on Beach Road, and he told you he was going to the Raffles Hotel to see Foon Mai Lee. We know that she booked in there several days ago, intending only to stay for 48 hours. But that same afternoon, she left in the company of a Chinese gentleman. She has not been seen since. Now, Ben Plume, we have no knowledge of any American, Asian or otherwise, by that name. Buck teeth and a mustache. Even the immigration boys can't help us on this one. Are you sure this man came to your boat yesterday? There are witnesses. To everything that was said? You know, this is quite an important point. For instance, you could have fabricated the story to the [INAUDIBLE] yourself. In fact, you could have sent him to the hotel. Are you accusing me? Not directly. But you are certainly not above suspicion. It's your background, you know. He was a friend. Friends have killed friends for pettier reasons. I liked him. He was just a kid in love with the Far East. You were only, uh, friends? You know, that question shook you. I wonder why. We have quite a file on you. US Marines, service in Japan. Whoopee. Habits, Indian hemp and cocaine. And might I add that we will not tolerate this in Singapore. How long [INAUDIBLE]? 1963, Saigon. And your name is linked with exposing a certain Mr. Jacques Dutant, a well known leftist, a panderer at all the vice in the area. He's dead now. You come out of the affair remarkably clean. Or do you? Clean. Advertising agency in Bangkok. And three years later, you and your junk turn up here in Singapore. Not much of a record, Dearborn, is it? There's no direction to your life. Yes, well you may as well add four unpublished novels, three unproduced plays, two unfinished novels. Well, of course you could help your story by producing Mr. Plume. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to accompany me back to your junk. And I am going to question your employees. Someone somewhere must hate you. Only one. He's very, very dead. Baguette Frenchman, Jacques baby. One of your pals in that place on Boogie Street? Jacques Dutant was much too elegant for Boogie Street. An epicurean, very fancy. Made a fortune, the Saigon rackets to support his chintzy habits, until they caught up with him. I broke the ice with the wire service story. And then what? DAVE: I fell in love. I hope you're just being silly. But I'd like to chuck this rice and curry diet, go back to exotic Long Island. Milkshakes, hamburgers, real thing. I think it's time I shipped out. Dave, let's get married. Well, now that we're engaged, do I get my $20 back? [KNOCKING] Mr. Dave, Mr. Dave. The fat man, I saw him at Green Street. He didn't recognize me. Well, why did you follow him? EMPLOYEE: (OUTSIDE) He's still there. That's logical enough. I'm coming. Dave, let the police do it. Well, I have to live with myself, don't I? [MUSIC PLAYING] David! [MUSIC PLAYING] All right, go talk to him. [MUSIC PLAYING] Upstairs. Mr. Dave, they want $20. For what? MAN: [INAUDIBLE] [CAR HONKING] [KNOCK] Hi. Crazy American! Oh, you wanted some information. I got it. I-- I-- I was gonna call you this morning. Look, [INAUDIBLE]. I-- was going-- going to come right out. I-- I-- And Miss-- Miss Foo-- Foo Mai Loo. You're supposed to be-- You know, you're wanted by the police. Police? For the murder of Peters Fields. Come on. Come on. [STRUGGLING] Sorry about that. WOMAN: Hey! Hey, 20 bucks. 20 bucks. [INAUDIBLE] [URINATING] [YELLING] [INAUDIBLE] Let me collect myself. Let me catch my breath. Button up! I-- I just-- I just wanted the story about-- [STUTTERING] [INAUDIBLE]. Who killed Pete? I-- I didn't! I didn't! Who killed Pete? [YELLING] Start talking! [HOWLING] [INAUDIBLE] [YELLS] MAN: Thank you. Thank you, sir. What a bunch of perverts. Hey, Craig, give me a hand. MORRIS: Well, he's coming around now. Interesting character study, that. JONES: Welcome aboard, Mr. Dearborn. Welcome aboard where? MORRIS: Welcome to the Good Ship Lollipop, sweets. We're here to help you help us. My name is Craig Morris. This is my stupid-looking friend, Stanford Jones III. Thought you went home to mama. And I was gonna give you a job. JONES: We're gonna give you one, Dearborn. What, strangling myself? What's the going rate? MORRIS: Defeatist attitude. Perhaps suicidal, possibly schizoid. MORRIS: Well, we're a little nuts in this business, right, Dave? JONES: A real loser, that Dave, aren't you? Down to cruise in public toilets. Why? Are you lonesome. Hey, look, fella, sit down. You too. OK. We had our little joke. Now, we'd like to remind you, you're still an American. A patriotic one, we hope. Or do you prefer cash? Cash. JONES: OK, perv. We'll talk cash. MORRIS: Nasty little creep, aren't you? Wanna try me, pervert? You can beat up on him later. Hey, you know, you did some remarkable work up in Saigon a few years ago. Jacques Dutant? I was just getting a story. You posed as a homosexual to get in good with Dutant? That's right. Told me everything I wanted to know with a little kiss right on the-- -If you say so, Dave? How was it Dave? Better than a $20? MORRIS: Shut up. Anyway, it was a remarkable piece of work. Vietnamese police, busted his vice ring, he fled to the north. And was bombed to death. Or shot to death in a remote hut. How do you guys know so much? We read a lot. He was bombed to death. Read your story. Nice piece of work. Did him in yourself. Very admirable. Disgusting. But with so many young kids today freaking out, I thought I'd better do my bit for Uncle Sam. So why are you working for the local authorities, Dave? That's small time. DEARBORN: What? Inspector Fedister of the Singapore CID was aboard your Junk this morning. Let me put it this way, Dave. We need you to get us some information. I don't care about your coke or your sex life. Pretend you're doing a story. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. This is beginning to sound like a broken record. Your man Plume wanted the same thing. Plume? Plume? The guy I had my hands on when you so rudely interrupted. The school you had in the toilet? Yes, damn it. He wanted information too. Wanted to know about an old girlfriend of mine. MORRIS: Foon Mai Lee? You know her too. I sent a nice New Zealand kid up to say hello for me. He was strangled. Plume was the only lead I had. You guys let him get away. This really takes the cake. Hey, look. We don't go in for that murder and cut throat stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Who are you guys? I'm hitchhiking through Asia during my school holidays. Craig Morris, insurance, Minneapolis. Say, I'd like to talk to you about some mutual funds. Hey, we can go as high as 20,000. That's US money. [INHALES] You see, Mai Lee's old man Lim is the bad guy. Well, he was on the Junk last night. When the generator conked out and the lights blew? Hey, we thought that was a signal. Sure had us fooled. You flatter me. We suspect Lim's smuggling some hot information from China. DEARBORN: No, knowing Lim, it's probably dope. Some crap about antimatter that got this whacked up professor in Peking. And I capture the secret document and collect 20 big ones? MORRIS: Possibly 30. We do have big expense accounts. --[INAUDIBLE] professor and you get an oil well, half of AT&amp;T, 40,000 green stamps, Miss America, and the boys [INAUDIBLE] in Saint Anthony's. And all this just for balling an old girlfriend of mine? It'll be more fun than balling Dutant. Ah, Dave, baby. Be my guest. I want you to do me a favor. Ah. Pleasure's all mine. -No, no, no. Later. Babe, you're in the right position. I'm in the right mood. I want you to take a little walk with me. A walk? Where's your sense of timing? Just for a little while. I'll explain it as we go. Come on. A walk? [MUSIC PLAYING] David. Get out of here. Aren't you gonna say hello? Who let you in here? --[INAUDIBLE] I wanna talk to you. MAI LEE: There's nothing to say. I have a good man now. A good man? Mai Lee, I know a thing or two about Mr. Lim. I knew you'd pop up again and screw up my life. DEARBORN: I thought I could forget you. I can't. You sent a message over, didn't you? DEARBORN: Peter Fields? You sent him over because you were afraid. And what did you do with him? Didn't he give you my message, wise guy? Well, speaking of messages, why did come to my Junk last night? I had a date, and I felt like dancing. You knew I'd be there. Maybe I wanted to see how your new business was going. I just thought perhaps you were making a living for a change. It makes end's meet. David, David. Always making end's meet. By the way, who out you into the Junk business? One of your men friends? Yes, David. My life has improved considerably since I dumped you. Lim is a very good man. And he's loaded. Besides, he's closing a deal now that might us on easy street for a long time. Well, I'm working on a deal of my own. May put me on my feet. We could get out of here. I mean, there's always that job waiting for me in New York. Yes, David, you told me about that job. You'll never stop dreaming, will you? Remember? Yeah, I remember. Please go. Maybe I'll see you later. [EXHALES] Ah, Mr. Dearborn. And what happened to you yesterday? Look, give me a day or two. I'll come up with something. I was just good question Foon Mai Lee. Don't do that. Give me a day or two. I'm not going anywhere. No, you're not. I've just called at the Junk and, eh, collected your passport. $20? You're not talking US. I hope you're talking Singapore. That's a little steep. [DOOR OPENING] How'd you make out? What? You want a cut? He gave me $200. What did you find out? He's going to be on his rubber plantation tonight. On business. That's all? Uh, well, the only suspicious looking thing he had was, uh, this thing. [WHIMPERS] Suspicious. It's a tourist map of Singapore. [INAUDIBLE]. Stop by the Junk later tonight, have a drink. Listen, Ken, I want you to take care of business tonight. I'm gonna be, uh, away for a while. -[INAUDIBLE]? -[INAUDIBLE]. I'll talk to you later. Marcel Gilbert. Where is the gentleman missing? We cannot negotiate until he is here. I have no time. The deal must be negotiated properly. Who is missing? I'll let you know when he gets here. But it's already much too late. LIM: Do you have your money? MAN: 100,000. LIM: What are you prepared to pay? 250,000, if delivery is tomorrow. 300,000. LIM: Aha. That will give you an idea of the market price. But I must insist we wait until the third party is here. I have a reputation for clean business concession. I am not going to ruin it. I promised him a chance to big. PLUME: Can we get delivery tomorrow? My client insists. I'm in as much a hurry as you. PLUME: Is it in Singapore? LIM: Good night. It was pleasant. Good night. Good night to you, Miss Foon Mai Lee. Why must we wait? We'll give you 300,000 immediately. It's unfair. 350,000. Good night, Mr. [INAUDIBLE]. What's unfair in this business? 400,000. I am. Good night. MAI LEE: This third man, who is he? Somalvich, a Russian. He wasn't coming tonight. I wanted to see how much these two would pay first. Cheapskates. Tomorrow, we talk real money. Where is this information? Where is it? LIM: That's my secret. You will never learn it that way. Let's continue the interrogation in the bedroom. [MAI LEE SCREAMING] Dearborn here. MAN (ON RADIO): What happened at Lim's house? Samantro, an Indonesia. Fat Plume. They're trading. Said he's going pretty high. Half a million at least. MAN (ON RADIO): A bargain. You're paying me peanuts. MAN (ON RADIO): You're not a defecting Red Chinese scientist. Come on. The date, or whatever you're looking for. It's in a go down on Trafalgar Street. Now, the bad guys are going to an island tomorrow. I think I can pinpoint it. MAN (ON RADIO): Stay away from the island. Those guys play for keeps. Samantro slits throats for a hobby. There's a Russian involved. MAN (ON RADIO): Somalvich, trigger man for the KGB. He shoots first and asks questions afterwards. [ENGINE RUNNING] [ENGINE STOPS] [SQUEAKING] Thanks. [INAUDIBLE]. You're all muddy. Where have you been? Up country. Dave, you're not in any kind of trouble, are you? No. But I may make a lot of money. Money, money, money. Hello, little cash register. Bought you a present. Well, I think I'll wait til Christmas. I think you'd better open it now. Wear it in good health? You shouldn't have done it. Well, it was second hand. Yes, I know. The, uh, last owner was an old spinster that only used it on weekends, eh? Do I, uh, get a kiss? Dave. I want a present too. Hey, Bonnie, I'm very exhausted. Come on, Dave. You promised. Hey. Take it easy. Take it easy? When do I ever take it easy? Why didn't you take your pants off? Who had time? I didn't come here to get belt-buckled. Dave! [MURMURING] Dave. Dave? [YELLING] [CHIMPANZEE MUTTERING] [CHIMP SQUEALING] No, kill Dearborn! [CHIMP SQUEALING] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] Sorry about that. BONNIE: David. [INAUDIBLE] Bonnie! [ENGINE STARTING] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] Help me. Please. Please help me. Help me. [BOAT ENGINE] Please, let me-- let me die peacefully. Why do you want to kill me? Why do you want to kill me? It's-- it's too late to scare me now. Who wants to kill me? [LAUGHING] [LAUGHING MANIACALLY] Somebody loves you. Sorry to have to bring you along, Plume. Hope you do your job before you stink too much. You'll never understand this, Plume. But I've been through this sort of thing before. I should have stuck to the three B's-- booze, broads, books. And bang. Who loves me? Someone loves me. I don't have any kids, any family. They'd love me. Be nice to have a family. You appreciate kids, Plume? Family's one of the finer things in life. Don't you think? This must be the place, Charlie. [GUNSHOTS] Today, I will be very rich. Today, we will be very rich. Hello there. Hello. Stay there. Gentlemen, you are very good to me. You have eliminated yourselves and leave me all the cash. Mai Lee, we are very rich. We can sit up all night counting it. Not we, Lin. Me. [GUNSHOT] [GIGGLING] Dave. Do you know [INAUDIBLE] your daddy? What's the matter, don't you read that many poems? Get up. [INAUDIBLE] My god, you-- MAI LEE: Lim was no good. Who's Plume? MAI LEE: What the hell [INAUDIBLE]. Who's Plume? I don't know! Who wants to kill me? Whatever's coming out of China has nothing to do with me. Why should I die? Who wants to kill me? Don't you understand? If they want me dead, I'm dead. Dave. [INAUDIBLE]. I thought I'd helped. [CRYING] [YELLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] MAI LEE: Dave. Dave. Dave! Wake up! Dave. Dave! OK, Dutant, I see you. The name is Master Gilbert now. You're supposed to be dead. That's what you read in the papers? You're supposed to be dead. GILBERT: You did not do a good enough job, David. You did not aim. Your hand was shaking. DEARBORN: What have you done with Mai Lee? What would I do with her? You know me, David. She's as safe as she'll ever be. David does not enjoy my little cat and mouse game? Tell me! GILBERT: I had no intention of harming you, David. I have a very short memory for pain. And vengeance is not profitable. I am in Singapore strictly to pursue Mr. Lim's treasure. The money I scavenged from the island is enough. David, did you really love Mai Lee? Was she your Saigon girl? Yeah, she was my Saigon girl. GILBERT: Before me? Listen, if you're not gonna kill me, at least feed me. You know I'm always hungry when I come off a trip. GILBERT: I have had him since he was 12. Dutant, you're a degenerate. Your girlfriend. I must be off. As you say in America, I must make a fast getaway with the loot. Sleep tight, mon amour. The food's cold. Christ, he's at it again. David. OK, um, good bye. Hey, now, I can go and tell everybody I rescued a fairy princess. OK. How'd I get here? JONES: We carried you. We couldn't schlep you across Singapore in your party outfit. Mai Lee. We're trading her off to the local so they'll stop being mad about me about plugging that guy in the AC outlet and jumping the fuse. God, what a racket he made when I dumped him in the bathtub and turned up the voltage. Blew out every night between here and the generator. [INAUDIBLE]? He's booked on the 8 o'clock plane to Paris. The police'll grab him at the airport. I'm gonna grab him first. Don't go to the airport. The police are very mad on you. I got a score to settle! A big score! You won't make it. You'll be picked up first. Well, I'm gonna try! Wait a minute. Don't say I told you, but our files say he has a boyfriend in Pangling Row, number 27. He may have stopped off there for a quickie before catching the plane. 27? Yeah. Thanks. And, uh, take a bang-bang. It helps the old confidence. Say, and, uh, listen. Who care which way you guys swing? I mean, I understand you. I mean, live and-- live and let live. Well, I try to be broad-minded. Can't say I wasn't broad-minded. I was nice to the guy. Pleasant. Cheerful, even. I mean, I gave him the gun and he walked out the door. They're all the same. [MAN GROANING] Why don't you buy a clock that works? You can afford one? I've given you a fortune. Bitch. I have only 20 minutes to catch my plane. You don't care, do you? You don't love me. You're just out for money, like all the rest. [DIALING PHONE] Hello? Can you tell me if the Cathay Pacific flight to Jakarta will depart on schedule? [FRENCH] I suppose you want some money. There. It's the last you'll get from me. But don't spend it all on a 200 pound Malay girl with gold teeth. [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOT] Well, it was fun while it lasted. Or was it?
