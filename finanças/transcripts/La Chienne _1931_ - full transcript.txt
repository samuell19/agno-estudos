DIGITALLY RESTORED IN 2014 FROM THE ORIGINAL NEGATIVE Ladies and gentlemen, we are proud to present a stirring social drama. Our presentation will prove that vice never goes unpunished. Ladies and gentlemen, we're proud to present a comedy with a moral. - What are you doing? - Announcing the show. - That's my job. - No, it's mine. Ladies and gentlemen, don't listen to them. The play we shall perform is neither drama nor comedy. It contains no moral message and has nothing to prove. The characters are neither heroes nor villains. They're plain folk like you and me. The three leads are... He, She, and the Other Guy - as always. He's a good sort, shy, getting on in years, and incredibly naive. In sensitivity and intellect he's so superior to those around him that they take him for a complete idiot. She... is a girl with a certain charm and a touch of vulgarity. She's always sincere... and lies all the time. The Other Guy... is just plain Dédé - enough said. And now, ladies and gentlemen, on with the show! Speaking for myself, on this ceremonious occasion I'm very moved to convey to you the fond respect of our happy family, the firm that you manage like a father. Believe me, Mr. Henriot, that the entire staff of Henriot & Company, hosiery wholesalers, for whom I speak, are proud of this award, which is fitting recognition of your courageous efforts. Gentlemen, to your health! Now, my friends... as we say in the army... bottoms up! That's a good one. Good old Legrand, always on the ball! The life of the party awakens! Great idea! It'll be a scream with old Legrand. I say, Legrand, the nighfs still young. Here's what we've planned... He won't go for it. He's too scared of his wife. No, I'd rather go straight home. Did your wife give you a midnight curfew? Yes. I don't want trouble at home, and I'm just not interested. Are such crass pleasures beneath you? No, I know we can sometimes find nature in a bouquet of faded flowers, the forest in a bottle of perfume, or freedom in a few cocktails, but I believe those things are best found in solitude. I thought you were more fun than that! The illusion of love may survive the sight of a dingy bedroom, but inevitably one awakens. I don't take life so seriously. What counts is having fun and being with the right crowd. Well, you'll enjoy yourselves more without me. I'm not much fun, and I'm not very sociable. Very well, but I must say... when it comes to wet blankets, you lake the cake! I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Henriot. It would have been funnier with him there! Don't sulk. You know I don't like it. I'm not sulking, Déde'. I'll teach you to say you're not sulking when you are! I'll get you your 100 francs tomorrow. I need them tonight! I can't go to Marchafs now. It's too late. Enough excuses! Take that. Are you hurt? Forgive me. I was passing by. You hurt him. I'll see you home. We can't leave him like this. He'll catch his death of cold. I don't have money for a taxi. It's all your fault! It's nothing, darling. The fresh air was a shock for you. We'll take you home. You'll go to bed and get some sleep. You'll be fine. Number 3, Rue Perrault. No, wait here. I'll be right down. I'm sick of being around such a dopey dame. Get your claws in this guy or we're through. Bitch! Sure, Déde', whatever you want. I bumped into the door. He's much better. Which way are you headed now? I live near Barbés. May I accompany you? All right. We can walk. it's not far. If you like. He has good manners. He can be nice when he wants. - Still... He has manners, but he's easily led astray. Then he gets worked up, you know? I understand. Just yesterday he said if he had money, he'd dress me up nice and I wouldn't look half bad. You look fine as you are. And he's so talented. He does a terrific imitation of Maurice Chevalier. But he has no connections, so I have to help him' You help him? Yes, we've been together three years. That's like being married, isn't it'? Yes. You're an usher in a theater? No, I'm... a painter. I live around here. - May I see you to your door? - No, I'd best say good-bye here. I live with my family, and if neighbors see me with a gentleman - - Will I see you again? - I'll write to you. - I'd like that. - But at what address? General delivery. Maurice Legrand, with a D. I'm married, you see. All right, but which post office? Which post office? Place Vintimille. Good-bye, then. Good-bye, Mr. Legrand. Darling! Hey there. I'm sorry! What do I owe you? Fifteen francs. - Keep the change. - Thank you. Are you about done clowning around? Sorry. I was trying to be quiet. Why are you back so late? It's not late. I said to be home by 11:00! Everyone from work was there. The boss made a speech, and the senator came. That's no reason to wake me up with your crummy pictures! I'm sick of your paintings! Kindly remove these canvases that are cluttering up my apartment! My visitors think they're in a junk shop! I put them away as best I can. I never want to see them again! You hear me? Find another place for them... or I'll have the junkman come up and haul all this garbage away! Understand? Painting! The very idea! It's my only passion. You call that a passion? You're the laughingstock of the neighborhood, fancying yourself an artist! Oh, I wouldn't go that far... My first husband would never have wasted his time fiddling around with painting! Ah, yes. The sergeant. That's right. The sergeant! A real man! A hero! A brave man who gave his life in 1914 for sluggards like you! That wasn't my fault. How handsome my Alexis looked on parade! I admit I'm not as dashing as Alexis Godard! In any case, you've been warned. Now hurry up and get to bed! I want to get some sleep! You must have made a lovely couple. ONE MONTH LATER Here's the life of the party. Poor thing. His wife beat him up. Leave him alone. He's a nut case. You and Josephine Baker - don't make me laugh! It's like saying you met old Legrand out with a pretty girl! You see, Yvonne? What would you have done? Maurice had me leave my family and move in here. Maurice? The painter I met when Dédé felt faint and we took him home. What about Dédé? He knows all about it, of course. Why would he be jealous of a 42-year-old man? Come look in here. - Sure. You sure have a nice view! He's a swell guy, setting you up like this. Is he very rich? He gives me lots of stuff, but I think he's a bit stingy. The furniture is on the installment plan, because he couldn't pay up front. Did you see the wallpaper? Dédé helped pick it out. I want him to like it here. You're so sweet to him. See the pictures? Maurice painted them. Oil paintings. His wife couldn't stand them, so he brought them here. I'm no expert, but I think they're swell. Good thing he's giving me money tomorrow. Household expenses, the furniture, rent, a tip for the concierge - it adds up! Only I'm not telling Déde'. If he knows, I have 1,000 francs, he'll remember he owes one guy 800, and another 300, and I'll be broke! Better for him that I get settled in. Come see the bathroom. My dream! And a vacuum cleaner! - It's more hygienic. This thing uses gas. It's automatic! It must be handy for washing clothes. - Want to take a bath? - No kidding! Can I? I'll get you a fresh bar of soap. You love your painter? I can't say I dislike it with Maurice. It's just nothing. I lay back and think of Dédé. - You go to his place? - Of course not. He's married. To a colonel's widow! Well, I never! Ifs not disgusting like it was with old Marchal. He was the lusty type. So why did you do it with Marshal? I had to when Dédé was broke. So you like my little place? What would you have done in my place? Amédée, I'm thirsty. I'll shuffle. A strawberry vermouth. Same for you, Gustave? Two vermouth! A word of advice, pal: Train them correctly right from the start And for that you gotta know what you're doing. Especially since your dame's no spring chicken. Don't let her snow you with her diamonds and chauffeur. How did you know all that? When I see a handsome kid like you in a fancy car with some old bag, you can't tell me she's your cousin and that you saved up for the gas! I bet you met at a dance hall. You always meet that type in a dance hall. You're right, but you're hardly one to be handing out advice. I know. You mean Lulu. You're sayin' she still acts kinda... dopey, right? I've never been able to get her to wise up. I really have to rough her up just to get her to bring me 50 francs! But now... with Legrand on the hook, I'll be on easy street. Easy street! - Who's this Legrand? The guy I met the other night. He's loaded, pal! Don't know him. He tried to horn in on my conversation with Lulu. A guy in a tux. Probably dead drunk from some nightclub. He starts bawling me out, so I lay him out flat. God's truth. So he gets up and says, “Okay, okay. Let's go have a drink.” We were bosom buddies just like that! Back at your stupid painting again? Been out for a walk, dear? I don't have time for fun. I went to collect my dividends. Our dividends. My dividends! Nothing here is yours. Our dividends. Ours. Our dividends. So you're cluttering up my place with more paintings? I said to get rid of them, not paint more. - Just one picture. - Another self-portrait? You couldn't find some other model? And what did you do with the others? Sold them to the junkman. Sold them? You couldn't have! I did. For 100 francs. Where's the money? Hand it over. Scared I'd do something extravagant? With what I give you every week, and the way you waste it on paints and canvas? I don't have to worry about that! You're not like Alexis. Did you have to worry with Alexis? He was a man. A real ladies' man. Amédée, another round. - Vermouth? - Strawberry for me. Always. Yes, pal, he's a painter. He paints pictures and sells them in America. They sell as fast as he can paint 'em. He's setting Lulu up nice. The dumb broad was talking about dropping him for me - a pimp! I spelled it out for her. Said I'd see her more often, since he's hitched. And I can take her out in society once she's smartly dressed. How would I look going out with a dame who's in cheap cotton stockings and a dime-store hat? Not me! Anyway, I've won 37.50 francs. Add it to what I owe you. You're in no rush for it, right? Mind getting the drinks too'? What a lovely evening. You spoil me, darling. Happy? Yes, but I'm worried you're spending too much on me. I have eight francs left. Enough for the metro. Half past midnight. I told Adéle I'd be back by midnight. How time flies! And we didn't even do anything, darling. When I think we've never spent a night together. I'd love to spend a whole night with you, feel your warm, soft body next to mine all night long. I'm coming up. No, you mustn't get in trouble over me. I'll make up something. Let me come up. Be sensible. I want to as much as you do. Go home now. I have to go. Your lights are on! I forgot to turn them off when I left. I'd rather come up, just in case. Don't worry. A burglar wouldn't turn on the lights. And I'm afraid three flights would exhaust you. What a sweet girl! Kiss me. Better than that. It's Pelletier! Evening, Déde'! It's about time. I was about to scram. Darling, Maurice saw the light and wanted to come up. So what? You can say I'm your kid brother Fernand. Listen. I need some dough, baby. I don't have any. He only had eight francs left. And those flowers? And what's that? - Candy. Fine. I'm off. Where are you going to do with those? If anyone asks, just say you don't know. - Dédé. - What? Stay a while. Sure! And make polite conversation with Madame? What do you take me for? - Yes, Mr. Gustave? - A brandy. - Make it two. - Two brandies! - What's all this? - I gotta talk to you. This is strictly legit. I'm not getting mixed up in any shady business. I'm selling paintings. - You're kidding me! What are you laughing about? There's money in paintings like everything else. Legrand gave them to Lulu. I'm selling 'em. Are they signed? The cops will get you. They're not signed. I won't say they're by Maurice Legrand, idiot. He gave them to Lulu, so they're mine. People say they're worth something. With paintings, all that counts is the signature. Since you can't use a well-known name, all you'll get is peanuts. Same again, Amédée. - Put it on my tab. - Will do. I'll say I painted them. You don't look like a painter. - Lulu, then. - “Lulu”! That's no name. What's her full name? Lucienne Pelletier. Sounds low-class. I've got an idea. Say Lulu painted them, but call her Clara Wood. Whds Clara Wood? A filly who won at Tremblay today. Cost me 500 francs. We gotta see an an dealer fast. I'll come with you. Okay- I'll break my date with the old bag. We'll get a cab and I'll help with your paintings. Yeah, forget the old bag. I've had enough of this art game. This is my last try. Don't let it get you down. You gotta keep trying. Wait for us here. - Mr. Wallstein? - That's me. - I have two paintings here. - Just a minute. Where'd that lithograph go'? Let's see them. They're unsigned. Who are they by? Clara Wood. - Who's that? - An American artist. - And they belong to you'? - No. Well, practically. I'm her business manager. I see. I'm Langelarde, the art critic. You know, it's critics who make a painter's career. I might be able to promote this Clara Wood. Is she young? Does she paint a lot? I'd say sq! She's a great artist. - That remains to be seen. - I'm happy to discuss it. I can see we'll get along. I'm sure we will. And all strictly on the level. Wallstein, come have a look. Look at this. SEVERAL WEEKS GO BY Excuse me. My boss sent me. I'd like to ask the price of this painting. Twenty-five thousand. But it's not even a well-known artist. Perhaps not to you, but Clara Wood is becoming quite famous abroad. Really? My boss said the same thing. Could you give me her address? My boss would like to deal with her directly. Impossible. Clara Wood has signed an exclusive ten-year contract with Mr. Wallstein. What a pity. Good-bye. It was my idea, and my kid brother Fernand took the paintings to a dealer. Your brother Fernand? I told you about him. He's in business. Oh, yes. And the dealer thought they were terrific. He wanted the artist to sign them all, and you did give them to me, didn't you? Yes, darling. Don't you think ifs swell we sold them all, all those paintings you said were too ugly to sign? I think it's great. I'm so happy to be going out in society with you. I feel the same way. You know that. Only the evening isn't going to be much fun. Thafll do. The other hand. I know Langelarde's friends. All artists, decked out in blue and red. No idea how to dress. You look so sharp. I'd love to go somewhere classy with you, like the opera. No one goes to the opera anymore. But if you really want to, we can go. One of these days. It's just that now that you've made it - I've made it? Yes, you're a big name now, and all thanks to me! You gotta go out and be seen. So tonight we just gotta put up with those loonies. Now that I've made it, I wish I hadn't, so I could be with you all the time in a little house, just you and me. Well, tonight I gotta talk to Wallstein. Yes, Dédé. My tum. Evening, boys. Isn't Clara here? She's probably with Langelarde. Don't mind us, Clara! Mr. Wallstein, how about a little advance? Don't push it, pal. Besides, Langelarde has a client to introduce to Clara. Just be patient. - Whds the client? Some guy who wants his portrait done. Clara doesn't do portraits! That's her big mistake. Clara, we must have a serious talk. You're pleased with me, I hope? I take you out in high society, and we've started to attract a lot of collectors. Now, believe me, it's time you start doing portraits. I don't feel like it. Why not'? We've given lots of painters their start. And this is a very attractive deal. I'll introduce you anyway. The guy's loaded. If you're too dumb to seize this chance, tough luck. No, I don't want to do portraits. Men are such bores! It's always the same thing. Play us something nice. A little waltz? I'll talk to her. Come on. Are you crazy? Turning down that deal! Would you like me to do it? What do you think? I'll ask him for a photo of himself. Then Maurice can do it. No, no photos. They'll smell a rat. Just ask him for an advance of 5,000 and then get friendly with him. What a bore! What's it matter, just this once? Good evening, Langelarde. My dear Mr. Dugodet. Allow me to introduce Mr. Wallstein. My pleasure. - Mr. Gustave. - My pleasure. Where's this Clara you spoke of? She's over there dancing. Clara, my dear. Clara, this is Mr. Dugodet. It's an honor. What an unusual place! But you know what they say about artists! It's quieter over here. Time to go, pal. - She's really something! - That's one way to handle it. Darling! Put “Pay to the order of' and my name. Andre' Joguin. Thatis-h'. Now your name. The date. That's it. You can be so inept, sugar. So inept. Very nice. You say your wine merchant coughed up without batting an eye'? Then you're not very smart, baby. You should have asked for more. Listen... can you lend me 300 of that to buy fabric and get a dress made? You're the one who wants me to go out. In your situation, a smart dame always finds a way. Don't ask me! Who got you where you are now? Me! Jeez! I owe on the furniture too. Then tell the old guy to get a move on. He must paint in slow motion! You're leaving already? You're mean. You're going to that café again where your pals will get you drinking. It's bad for you. They'll win all your money at cards. Well, good-bye, darling. Bye. Kiss me better than that. Don't drink too much. And be careful you don't catch cold. You look so sad. Come now. What's the matter? Is something wrong'? I thought Wallstein - Oh, art dealers make lots of promises they don't always keep. Anyway... maybe it'll all work out. But for now I'm broke. All right. Good night, Legrand. - Mr. Legrand? - Yes. - Don't you recognize me? - No. Sure you do. I'm sure you've seen my face somewhere. I'm sure she's put my picture in plain view. I know how she is: right where it will get your goat, too. Don't recognize me without the mustache? Alexis Godard, the sergeant! I was your wife's husband! Alexis Godard? My wife's husband? The sergeant? But aren't you dead? - Yes! That's why I need to talk to you. But not here. Let's go to a cafe' and I'll explain. Come on. In September 1914, I was reported killed in action. But I was a POW in Germany under a dead pal's name. I'd taken his ID card. I swapped mine for his. To get away from my wife, not the army. - And after that? - After that? After the war ended, I knocked around and even went to jail. I have an offer for you. An offer? Suppose I said, “That's my wife. You're not married. I'm taking her back. It's my right. And I'm a war hero! What were you doing while I was off being killed? You stole my lawful wife.” What would you say? Why, I'd have no answer. I'd have to step aside. - Sorry. You got a cigarette? Gimme a light. Thanks. I thought you'd want to help me. I'm willing to make the sacrifice, but I deserve a little something, don't I? What's 10,000 francs to you? Not all at once, of course. Give me 5,000 today and the rest in a month or two. No, I'm the one who should walk away. I'm the one who must make the sacrifice. You're Ad'ele's lawful husband. You have priority. I stole your wife. It was excusable as long as I didn't know, but I can't go on with it now! What a shame. I passed myself off for dead. I took another man's name. I even pulled some capers in a dead man's name. If I go public now by claiming my wife, I'll have to explain to the authorities. No! I gotta disappear! Give me 1,000 francs and you'll never see me again. A thousand francs? I'm sure you've done like I did and squirreled some money away on the sly. Yes, we have some savings. Adéle hides it in the wardrobe. I'm not allowed near it. But come to think of it... you're Mrs. Godardls real husband. That's right. So why don't you come and take the money? You know where the wardrobe is. No dice. If you want to pay me, take the money yourself. No, listen. If I take Mrs. Godard's money from her apartment, I'm a burglar. What if Adéle catches me and calls the police? Don't worry. We're going to the theater tomorrow night. We'll be out until midnight. Come tomorrow night at 11:00. I'll give you the key. When you walk past the concierge's door, just call out “Legrand.” Once you've got what you want, you can just walk out. It's a deal. Tomorrow night at 11:00. Legrand? Marlborough is of! to war Who knows when he'll return You went to that café again? Don't worry your little head. Marlborough is of! to war Marlborough is of! to war Who knows when he'll return Just look at the state you're in! He?! return on Easter He?! return on Easter Or Trinity Sunday What if he came back before that? I'd love to see your face if he came back before that. You're revolting! Just go to bed! We'll have a little talk about this tomorrow. Just you wait! Big things are going to happen tomorrow, Adéle. Forgive me, Madame, for being so familiar and calling you Adéle. It's a habit born of a long misunderstanding that led to us sleeping together for several years. Tomorrow... Are you going to read much longer? Fifty more pages. I'm thirsty. Thafll teach you to go out drinking. That's better. The power's gone out! Shit! Bastard! Help! You said you'd be at the theater! Help! Murder! We'll sort it out tomorrow. Go easy! Murder! Help! Let's get a light in the kitchen. Help! Murder! The neighbors will tear you to pieces. What about the dough you promised me? Keep out of sight! Come in. He was still drunk... so he went to the kitchen for some water. Then the lights went out. I heard someone swear. My husband's disappeared! Madame, I can understand why you'd make up this story about robbers. But the police serve the law and have a right to the truth. And I'm sure they're discreet. Officers, ifs a matter of some delicacy. I was in bed with Madame when her husband caught us. Fearing a violent scene, Madame called the police. But I'm a peaceful man, and her husband is very civil. And where is Madame's husband now? Is he the one who disappeared? - My goose is cooked. - You're not dead'? No. Why won't you let me dump him? We need him! We need him? No, listen. I did a little figuring. Don't get up yet. Stay till half past, okay? Don't scowl like that. You'll be with your buddies in 40 minutes. Is your little woman such bad company? Listen... I did a few calculations. We must have something left from the paintings you sold. Now I have to account to you for the dough? You're so mean. It's just that you said you'd take care of putting something aside. That was a good idea. I might have spent it all. So now maybe we have enough to live on for a few months if we went away together? Freedom! Lulu, life is beautiful! And you could paint pictures yourself. You're as smart as old Legrand. Smarter even. I'd mix your colors and clean your brushes. It would be wonderful. Would you shut up? You can be a real pain when you get started. All right, darling. I won't say any more if it bothers you. Kiss me. Mr. Legrand! I believe Miss Pelletier is out. I have a key. She went out and hasn't come back yet. That's all right. I'll wait upstairs. Oh, well. Let them work it out! You're my brother. I'm sick and you're visiting. Make something up! Get dressed, quick! That's right. He's my boyfriend. What about it'? Madame has her little caprices! You wanted to get me into bed? Think I enjoy it? And you just had to give the old geezer a key? Don't be mad. He didn't say anything. No, but I get the feeling he was laughing at us. If I'd known that a minute ago, I'd have busted that chair over his head! You think blubbering is gonna help? I'll give you something to blubber about. Whds gonna give us paintings now? My car's not even paid off. The whole thing makes me sick! I'm gettin' outta here. Good night. When will you be back? I'm very busy this week. Next week too. Will you write to me? Oh, sure. I'll write to you. THE NEXT MORNING I didn't think you'd be back. Darling, I'm so sorry I didn't guess the truth. I've always been off in my own world, ignorant about life. I never knew what wretched lives women have to live, how one slipup is fatal for them, how there's always a man to take advantage of it. But now I know. I understand. I'm free now. You have nothing to fear. I feel strong enough to protect you from anyone. But why didn't you trust me? Why didn't you confide in me? I'd have torn you from that man's clutches. How about finishing your painting? What? IneediL What if I don't finish it? You'd better. So that's it. My paintings. That's all you saw in me. What else? Take a look in the mirror. What a fool! To think I believed it all. You disgust me! You think I enjoyed it? If it hadn't been for your money, I'd have dumped you in a minute. Monsieur wants true love! To be loved for himself! What a laugh! You slut! You're no woman. You're a bitch! Talk away. You lick the hand that feeds you and the hand that beats you! If you knew how you bore me, you wouldn't waste your breath. So your pimp beat you. He was right: It's the only way to treat you. Maybe he did, but I love him. You love him? Get dressed. We're going away right now! Far away. Hurry up! If I sing beneath your window Like a gallant troubadour If 4 hope you?! appear there Alas, ifs not for love's sake How could you want to stay with him? I've sacrificed everything for you. I want you to know that. If you did, you might understand. I've given you everything. You can't love that man. He has no heart, no feelings... no breeding. My little Lucienne, you don't love me anymore? No, don't laugh. Don't laugh. Don't laugh like that. Don't laugh like that! You to whom I've so often sung Appear before me, I pray Bestow that kindness upon me Be kind, my unknown beloved To whom I've so often sung Appear before me, I pray Move it, kids. You're in my way! He could have said hello. I'd have given him Miss Pelletier's mail. What's this world coming to'? I'm going to take the mail up. Anatole! Something awfufs happened! So how's Lulu? I don't want to talk about Lulu! - Don't get mad, pal. - I'm not mad. - You had a fight? - Not at all. Just stay out of it. Mr. André, over there. Some buddies looking for me. What is it? - Andre' Joguin? - Yes. Why? - Come with us. - I don't even know you! Okay- Unbelievable! Hasn't this gone on long enough? Let me go. I'm a busy man! You're wasting my time! Simmer down. Just be patient. Easy for you to say! Here's Philoméne. Look at that ugly mug. Hello, Mr. Legrand. How are you? Good-bye, Mr. Legrand. Here they come. Mr. Legrand. Don't worry, pal. It'll all work out. Excuse me, ma'am, are you Mrs. Pelletier, the mother of...? No, sir. I've already told you. I'm a cashier for a wholesale hosiery company. How could I keep a mistress on my salary? Then... Very well. Do you know Andre' Joguin? I saw him once, the day I met Lucienne Pelletier. Later, when I heard she was seeing him again, I decided to break off all contact with her. But... I was very attached to her, sir. I'm a weak man. I just couldn't say good-bye to her. Did she happen to leave any paintings with you? Any sketches... or drawings? I could - You know, Mr. Legrand, liaisons like that are dangerous at our age, and as a rule... they end badly. It's best to just stay quietly at home. In any case... your testimony sheds no new light on this case. And you're not the son of person we usually find mixed up in this sort of crime. Forgive me for taking up your time. Don't be frightened. We'll be called in to see the magistrate. Just let me do the talking. Sure, you're the lawyer. But just make them understand... - I never knew she painted. - Be quiet! Don't be a fool! Andre' Joguin. You can tell the magistrate everything, buddy. Hello, sir. Sit down. Well? Have you thought it over? Have you decided to confess to killing Lucienne Pelletier? You know I can't confess just to make you happy, sir. Though you obviously think I did. But why would I kill her? I had everything to lose. But you yourself admitted that Lulu questioned you about finances that evening, and from what I've learned, a violent argument ensued. She even announced she was leaving you for an honest man, a cashier for a hosiery company with whom she was also involved. What's this about a cashier for a hosiery company? Lulu never mentioned that! If she'd had an affair with a cashier, she'd have told me. I'd have advised against it. She could do a lot better! She was a beautiful girl, sir. That's enough. What's this cashier's name? Maurice Legrand. You're mistaken, sir. Mr. Legrand is a painter. I'm in a position to know, believe me. - May I remind you - - Keep quiet, you. You weren't there. If you really insist I killed Lulu, I don't want to contradict you. - So you confess? Not at all. I was just kidding. I see. Very well. Let's have a look at your record. What we've turned up isn't exactly in your favor. What you've turned up? Oh, I pulled a few stunts, like all kids from good families. Happens in the best of circles. Sure, I accepted money from women, but they wanted me to have it. What would you have done? What about this white slave trade business? White slave trade? No! I gave advice to young girls who wished to travel and broaden their minds. That's right - broaden their minds. Better than being dairymaids or working in a factory. It starts out with what you call “stunts” but it ends up with murder. - You mean Lulu? - According to the concierge. That concierge is out to get me! For the last time, sir, I'm the fall guy in this whole business. I was sitting pretty before I got arrested! You're a real cynic. A cynic? Why am I a cynic? Mr. Legrand... you've been with our company for years... and up until now, we've done nothing but sing your praises... sing your praises... and sing your praises. You and a young woman - who'd made quite a reputation for herself even before this highly publicized tragedy - had an unfortunate affair. Most unfortunate. This would all be quite inexplicable had you not incurred on that young lady's behalf expenses that far exceeded your known sources of income. We do not pry into our employees' private lives, on the condition that in their professional capacity they behave correctly. However... we were concerned by these exorbitant sums inasmuch as we feared that the money might have come from our till. We examined your books last night after the office closed. There are 2,500 francs missing. Henriot & Company's cashiers must be above suspicion, and we therefore must dismiss you. Find another line of work where you won't be placed in temptation's way. Very well, sir. I'll leave. But you'll get your money back. I'll pay you back to show - Never mind that. You're leaving us for health reasons. No one here will ever know about this. Thank you, sir. ANDRE JOGUIN CHARGE: MURDER Defendant... you're about to hear the evidence against you. The first witness, please. My husband and I were listening to the street singers when I saw him going up to Miss Pelletiefs apartment. A few minutes later I took her mail up and found the body. I remember wondering why he didn't say hello, because he could have taken her mail up with him. My husband and I said to ourselves... “What's this world coming to?” And you saw no one else enter the building? No one. Any further questions, Counselor? No, Your Honor. You may stand down. I fear I have only negative reports regarding André Joguin. He was constantly going AWOL, and he even became the procurer for a prostitute in a nearby town. Colonel, would you please turn to face the jury? He finished his military service in Africa, where, if his superiors hadn't been too lenient in allowing him to return to civilian life, he'd still be sewing time in a penal battalion, and this tragedy would not have happened. Gentlemen of the jury, I can't believe that by now some doubt has not arisen in your minds. And should that doubt not be enough to convince you to acquit the defendant, consider his troubled youth and difficult background - - Let me talk. - Be quiet! Let me talk. I want to talk. I don't know where you dug up all that twaddle! Do you know my family? Were you near the kid when she got knocked off? No! So cut out all the fancy talk. All that matters here is the accused, and that seems to be me! Listen, I want to behave correctly and not shout, but I swear I'm not guilty! I swear I didn't kill Lulu! It wasn't me! He just committed suicide. Foreman, will you please read for the court your verdict? On my honor and my conscience, before God and men, the jury's decision is yes on all counts. Bring in the accused. To enforce the aforesaid articles, André Joguin is sentenced to death. His public execution will be held in a place in Paris designated by the public authorities. Based on the conclusions reached by... Hey, what do you think you're doing? Shit! What? Legrand! The sergeant! The sarge! I'll be damned! Good to see you again. You old son of a gun! I'll be damned! What are you up to ihese days? Nothing much. And you? What's it look like? Same as me, then. How's Adéle? She kicked the bucket years ago. Good for her. I wouldn't mind being dead myself. Cheerful, ain't you? Listen... you got any tobacco? I can't believe it! A lot's happened since I saw you last. I've done it all. I've been a peddler, a tramp, a drunk, a thief. And to start it all off, a murderer! What can I say? It takes all kinds! Here, you can have my shoes. Yes, in the car. - Hey, Sarge! - What? Twenty francs! No kiddin'! We're gonna have a feast! Come on! Life is beautiful!
