Her father owned the textile mill on the village outskirts. It closed in '36. Why is she here? She visited the cemetery and bought food from a farmer. We know they went past your house. I was asleep. Do you listen to the English radio? No. Well then, you're on our side. No. I'm not interested in the war. You're not interested in us defending you against Marxist ideology and Anglo-Saxon plutocrats? No. Does that interest you? Next. Did they hit you? No. What did they ask you? Stupid questions. Where are you going? - To the station. - There are no trains. The village is in lockdown until they find the pilots. Yeah, and it might take a while. Are you going to Rochettes or sleeping here? Where's Antoine? - What? - Antoine. Antoine... You know him. One day he's here, the next... His van's outside. He can't be far away then. What's wrong with you tonight? It's because of the goats. Off you go to bed. I'm taking some goats to the slaughterhouse. - Are you leaving now? - Yes. If I can. Antoine. Take me with you. If I were you, Thérèse, I wouldn't go with a guy the Germans let through. Why did the Germans give you an pass? Ask him, Mrs Dutheil. They won't let you through. Hide me among the goats. Heavens, you're worse than when you were a kid. You remembered we grew up together. So you've got room for me. Goodbye. I obey Thérèse Wyssant, not Mrs Dutheil. Nice one. - Have a good trip, collabo. - See you, Curly. You can go. You don't believe them, do you? You know, Antoine... I sleep. Know what they call the Dutheils around here? I sleep and no one bothers me. I shouldn't have come back. It's true. Remember the Saint Anne festival? - You were 15. - Yes. Your mother wouldn't let you go... Father let me out through the back. - He was wonderful. - Yes. - He set his hot-air balloon on fire. - And almost burnt the forest. We called you impish Thérèse. Remember? - What's wrong? - Nothing. It was running well. You'll see later. What's English for "décharger et pousser"? Why? They're from the plane. - Why not tell me? - Take the wheel. - It's not my problem. - Take the wheel. When I say "accelerate", go for it. I'll never forgive you. - Are they Germans? - They're not Germans. How do I say: "Don't speak in English"? - Tell them to catch the billy goat. - I can't say that in English. STATION Well? Is it chilly? - Saint-Eustache church. Repeat. - Saint-Eustache church. Young girl in blue, holding Signal. Young girl in blue, holding Signal. Ask the winning number. She'll say: "5". The Gestapo's discovered the network. I have to go. - See to the pilots. - What shall I do? Tell them to get out, the Gestapo's seen my van. Take them to Saint-Eustache. Young girl in blue. Signal. Number 5. No way. - You're their only hope. - It's not my business. I don't think you'd become a bitch. Five. Five? Five what? The winner. The winning number. I was supposed to answer. The men are here. - You're late. - Antoine had a problem. He was found out. He's gone to Reims. To... Sophie's. Shout it out. Let everybody know. Sorry... - You'll take care of the parcels. - No! Yes! Legendre Pharmacy, rue de Varennes. Dressed like that, no need for a password. No, I can't. - I'm expected at home. - You're expected. If I'm late, others will be caught. I need to find a new hideaway. Know what that means? No. You're a beginner. Sophie! I'll send a report to Sophie. This is the last time you do a handover. Thank you. I want a chocolate vermifuge. I've vermifuge, but not a chocolate one. And chocolate without vermifuge? Chocolate without vermifuge? Here. - How much? - Forget it. Off you go. Hello, sir. I've brought the parcels. Come through here. The first floor. Tell them they're my belongings and it's my case. Take it. Listen, could he stay at yours? - No. - For 2 days. Then the network will get him to Spain. In 48 hours' time. No, sir, I can't. There's always a hot-headed one. He'll be caught without any ID. You should have put him up. I'm not his mother. You look tired. You went back to Rochettes, of course. You know that Jacques finds that unpleasant. He said so in his last letter. Don't our dear peasants realise we're at war? It's the mating season there. Those two wrinkles there, at the corner of your mouth, make you look so old. Wrinkles of disgust. Mother phoned. Lucie's becoming a nun. It was to be expected. Impish Lucie. Impish? My sister? What a word! A cell for a cell. Maybe she'll learn to laugh at the convent. And you. You're already on the warpath. I've a business lunch. Someone must take care of family affairs. Whose family? Yours. Thérèse Dutheil. I forgot. I'm here to remind you. Enjoy your meal, Agathe. If I may. Sign... there. Your turn now. No. No. It's not necessary. - Do you listen to the English radio? - Certainly not. - Everyone listens to it. - I don't. You do surprise me. Pleasantly. For once. I said: "For once". That's true. You're feisty. Others just want to jump on the bandwagon, as they say. But... you've also sold a lot to the Germans. That's different. They were our clients before the war. You don't need anything now. So the villa in Royan... - Can I leave now? - Wait. Just wait. I think she has a new hairstyle. You should listen to the English radio. With that hairstyle she looks just like... They say those who worked with the Germans will be prosecuted. ...the goddess of death. They're publishing lists, lists of heads that will roll. Are you on the list? I'm leaving. Will you come when I take the veil? Poor Lucie. They'll shave your hair. It's all you have left. Thérèse. You will pay for that. With what? Lucie. I'll see you out. Goodbye, Lucie. I'm fond of you, you know. Right. Come on. - Maria! Are you there? - Yes. On your way down, stop at the second floor, tell Miss Dutheil you're taking the children to the cellar. Make sure they don't catch cold. There's a light up there! You're dreaming. Where are the children? - In the cellar with Maria. - She could have told me. I told her to. You're not going down, of course. No. Thérèse! Hello, madam. I'm here about Allen Morley. The American who didn't want to stay here yesterday. He spent the night at my place. I want to know the plans for getting him to Spain. I have to tell him... when he's leaving, at what time and who will accompany him. I don't know, madam. Don't bother, I told you there was no one upstairs. Do you paint? No. You have family in Sweden? No. Where do you live? Trocadero. I'm sorry, madam, I can't help you. You don't realise, that young man is waiting at my house. Are you sure? Allen? Now then, aren't you sleeping? I've started episode 24. It's about prince Cuddles and Ginévra the blonde. That's bronze head. He put these one-eyed men together. They're both blind in their left eye. One can't see with his right eye. What's Ginévra doing? - She's sleeping. - Again? If she's always asleep, she can't help Prince Cuddles. He's found the solution. Be quiet. It's a secret. He's disguised as an Indian. We'll tell you the rest tomorrow. Yes, that's a good idea, tell me tomorrow, because now you're going to bed. - It's time to sleep. - We'll be woken by the alerts. There aren't alerts every night. Tonight's sky is for alerts. She likes it when there are alerts. Really? Aunt Agathe said you never turn the lights off. I know what Aunt Agathe says. Goodnight. Hello. Pharmacy Legendre? Yes. Mr Legendre, please. Who's speaking? Mrs Dutheil. No, the person you told there was always a hot-headed one. Hello? Don't move! Thérèse. Thérèse. Did you listen to the news? The Germans themselves have implied that the landing is but a matter of weeks. We have decisions to make. Do you know what time it is? Agathe, you're going to give me the apartment key. It's unacceptable, you coming in here at any time of day or night without warning. For now, this is my home. Going to Rochettes does you no good. Prince Cuddles has come back. He came during the night and played the piano. You'll be late for school. Come along. Hurry up! You'll have lunch at mine. Maria will collect your belongings. - You'll sleep at mine too. - I don't think so. I'm not asking for your opinion. We'll think about it. - The train for Toulouse. - Platform 5. Excuse me, sir. Excuse me. Let me through, sir. The machine is out of order. Oh, no. No, no. There's no room here. - What's the first station? - Les Aubrais. - Is it far? - Not really. - What time do we arrive? - 9.30 am. Thank you. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Don't mind me! - You could apologise! - He's deaf, sir. - He could talk. - He's deaf! I've priority, sir! Shameful! You only think about eating. It's no surprise France lost the war. You're no better than the soldiers. There's a pregnant woman. Where's the exit?

Move along now. Don't stay in the corridor. I've lost my ID. Are you sure? They're searching the station. We can't stay here. We'll take care of you. There's a mail train for Perpignan. And then? - Can we leave here easily? - I'll sort it for you. Be careful outside. LIBERATORS? - Which stop for Cours Billon? - The next one. Thank you. It's the next stop. Hello, madam. How pretty. Off you go. Prosecutor Jasseron has been executed. - That's one less bastard. - Six bullets in the stomach. Six bullets in the stomach, that hurts! They said they'd get him and they did. He'd just condemned 2 resistance fighters to death. Surname, first name. Born in... Antwerp, Belgium. May 16, 1915. Father's name? Please. - Me? - Yes. You too. Thérèse Wyssant, 130, avenue Henri-Martin, Paris. The Gestapo is looking for you for your involvement in the murder of one of their agents. Last night. In the Paris-Toulouse express train. For now, we, the French Police, are not involved. But... we are interested in Sophie. I don't know her, sir. Unfortunately, 4 of your agents were arrested last night. You didn't know? Have you ever been to the pharmacy Legendre? In Paris. A pharmacy? I might have bought aspirins. Aspirins. Let's not waste time. There's also the supposedly Flemish man you travelled with. I travelled alone, sir. Commissioner Lerat is questioning him. These last few years, he has been less indulgent than... Richebois... or myself... for those French people led astray by a passion for politics. Lerat was somewhat brutal. The Resistance has condemned him to death, he has nothing to lose and will make your companion speak. I'm delighted to finally meet the famous Sophie. For 3 years... we've been trying to get hold of you. Sophie. I don't understand. I'm leaving. I want to leave. I want to leave! I want to leave! Come on, calm down, Sophie. I didn't think you were so fragile. You're tired after your journey, a long wait, the heat... A glass of water? Or a beer maybe? A cigarette. I'm sure you smoke. Richebois. Thank you. Right. That's better. I've nothing against you. Whatsoever. What we're really interested in, the French police, is Titus. Titus? Yes, Titus. Yes, Titus is hiding in Toulouse. He's lost contact with the network. You came here to establish contact. Give us Titus and I'll arrange things for you. Titus, my father's horse, is dead. She's laughing at us. Take me to Titus. To your meeting place. I have a letters rogatory from Paris for you two. I'll send you straight back. You'll remain in French hands. I can't make it any clearer. Phony interrogation, phony answers, another phony interrogation and confrontation. That'll take 3 months. The English and Americans aren't far from here. The Soviet Army is on the Danube. 3 months. You'll survive. Titus too. Mr Legendre, his employee, Germaine Riché, Geneviève Sérésia. Sainte-Eustache. They're all in the Gestapo's hands. Oh, yes, your friend, Antoine... Le... Leriche. He didn't enjoy their interrogation methods. He jumped out of the window. From the fifth floor. Dead. I'll let you think things over. - And the other one? - Lerat is making him talk. - He's vicious. Has he shouted yet? - Not yet. An American. Allen Morley. Air-Force. Immatriculation 85.843. Methodist. Not very talkative. Wouldn't tell us his army rank. We'll find out. None of that here! You're lucky. The chief has principles. They won't prevent him from handing you over to the Gestapo. What does that mean? Shit. You'll have to confront Sophie and him. There's nothing to prove they know each other. No. - Easy does it. - Yes. You've thought it over. Free the Flemish man. I was thinking about the death of... the prosecutor... what was his name? Jasseron. He was too involved. That's it. Maybe he didn't feel the wind change. Yesterday, it was "Long Live Pétain". Tomorrow, "Long Live de Gaulle". Today, it's "Jump on the bandwagon". I'm your chance to do so. An ideal one. That just turned up in your office. Sophie herself. You should bless the Lord. The Flemish man is American. Give me Titus. I have to cover myself. Colleagues are watching me. It's a time for exchanges. It's the only solution for you. And me too. There's another one. 6 bullets in the stomach like Jasseron. It'll happen. And not long from now. What's in it for you? It's painful, in the stomach. There's a third solution. I hand you over to the Gestapo. An American. She's really dropped us in it. You know him? No. You don't? You've no gratitude... He doesn't like us touching his sweetie. So you conclude they know each other. Type up the statement. Come here. - The Gestapo's coming for them? - No, I'm taking them. A fine catch. And I want the Gestapo's congratulations. Shall I come? No. Tarbes called. A commando attacked the militia offices. The local police aren't reliable. Take 10 men and go there. But don't worry, I'll tell them you identified the American. Thank you. - Who's the driver? - Béjard. You'll come too. 200 metres, on the right, the road to Saint-Gaudens. There are a lot of resistance fighters. Don't get caught again. I won't be able to help you next time. Or myself. When the time comes, don't forget Commissioner Marboz. Marboz. M-A-R-B-O-Z. 3.50 francs. I have some even nicer ones, with whipped cream. But they're not cheap. Tell me what you think. They'd loved each other for just two days There's sometimes joy in pain But since they'd been in love Their future was no longer sad They lived with a strange dream And this dream was blue like the angels Their love was in its true springtime As pure as their sweet twenty years It's the romance of Paris It blossoms on every corner It brings to the hearts of lovers A little dream and blue sky This gentle chorus of our neighbourhoods Speaks so sweetly of love Everyone is enamoured with it It's the romance of Paris The suburbs are their true home They went at the end of the week To the woods to gather lily of the valley Or out on a sailing boat They drank in the open-air cafes White wine that made their heads spin What are you doing here? The last American they sent was from Frankfurt. He told me that. Hello. We ran away from Toulouse last night. The Gestapo is looking for us. When did you leave Toulouse? Yesterday. You cycled all night in high heels? Yes. Yes. Do you have your dog-tag? The police took the one from the guy from Frankfurt too. We can check. Take him to Gordon's. And the woman? If he has the all clear, so does she. And if not? We can't let them tell the authorities where we are. Come on. We have to take precautions. We've already had problems. Take him to Gordon's and her to Marie's. She'll take care of you. This way. Take the bikes. Up there. Emile, bring some coffee, please. Thank you. That's fine. Etienne! Etienne! - Etienne! - Yes, commander. Take Captain Morley to the drop-off point. Yes, commander. Can I eat first? No. Off you go. This is London. Being a messenger is the worst. I walked for 14 hours today. You must know what it's like, you're a cyclist. Thank you for the soap. There. - Have you done this long? - Almost 2 years. I've been here a few months. Before, I slept at home. - Does the American live close by? - Gordon? Across the valley. Are you married? My husband was caught. Deported. Thank you. - Have you any children? - 3. I haven't seen them since I left home... through the window. Drink up. The milk is delicious. Thank you. The captain would be furious if I went to see them. Men want to see their wives, women, their children... That's how you get caught. I have children too. How many? Two. And I can't go home either. Are they with your parents? No. My father is dead. Was he captured? No, he killed himself. He had a factory. It was taken from him... a family feud. She's free to go. She can't go home. The boss said she could stay at Marie's. We're safe here. The Boche don't come up here. And if they do, we're here. - The American? - We checked. He's legit. - What's he doing? - He's lucky. The convey will be at the border at dawn. We sent him to Port-Vieux. - Did he leave a message? - He didn't have time. Etienne took him on his motorbike. You'll like it here. It'll soon be summer. The forest is beautiful. Another messenger would be a help. Yes... and I'm becoming something of a cyclist. Excuse me. This is the spokesman of the French fighters. For the first time, I am speaking to you from France. Today, at dawn, we landed on the Normandy coast with allied troops. From the first freed part of our country, I tell you... tears, humiliation, anger, suffering, sacrifices, nothing will have been, nothing will be in vain. France, present in battle, will be present in victory. Subtitles: ECLAIR V&A
