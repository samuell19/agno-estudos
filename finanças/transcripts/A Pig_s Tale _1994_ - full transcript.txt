Attention! Hello there! Children, parents, we'd like to just take a moment to send a Kamp Kipperman greeting to all you parents. Mister. Excuse me. Sir. Mister. Later. Not now. Not now, kid. Rest assured that we here at Kamp Kipperman take your child's summer recreation... What? What? All right, everybody. Just proceed to your assigned buses. You can find them. They're right there. O.K., Tadpoles, I'm Barry, your counselor. Can I get all the Tadpoles over here... Barry! Barry! Barry! Barry! Barry! Barry! Barry! Ha ha ha ha! I hate it already. Andy, we've been through this a thousand times. You're going to love it. Have a nice summer, son. Don't disappoint me. Take care of yourself. And have a great summer. I will. O.K. Ohh! Be good. O.K. I love you. I love you. Tadpoles, it's not very nice to crush people. When you crush someone, they hurt. That, gentlemen, is my babe for the summer. Woof! You almost forgot your toothbrush and your night light. Oh, and I found this under your bed. Mom! Put that away. I can't believe this. Oh, sorry, Andy. Geez! Bye. Hey, have a great time at camp this summer, Andy. I love you, Andy Pandy. Andy Pandy! Andy Pandy! Andy Pandy! Andy Pandy! Andy Pandy! Hey, watch it! You're on my kicks! Kicks? Oh! Oh, your shoes. Uh... sorry. You are sorry. Ha ha ha! I'm sorry to be here. Oh. Welcome, welcome, welcome, Kamp Kipperman Campers! Yay! Yay! Yay! I'm sure your stay with us will fill you with a lifetime of marvelous memories that you'll treasure each and every moment of summer. Whoa! Whoa! That was a close one. Hey, guys... thanks for the ride. Sorry I'm late. Hey, sweet cakes! I know what you're thinking. Is this stud muffin single? Lucky for you, the answer's yes. Excuse me, ladies. Well... O.K. Everybody, find your bunk assignments. Mellow out! Here, you do things my way! Hey, Troy, how's it going? Uh, is there anything I can do for you? We don't like some of the kids assigned to our cabin, so here's this year's bunk assignment. Well, as your counselor, it is my duty to make sure your summer is as pleasant as possible. Good. Keep doing what you're told, and my dad will give you a big tip at the end of summer. The rest of you pinheads, hurry up and figure out where you belong! This is Bunk Number 2? Oh, man! Incredible, isn't it? Yeah. But not for a wiener boy like you. This cabin's for Wolves. Wolves? It's a camp tradition for the strong... that would be us. To screw with the weak. That would be you, homey. By making your life miserable... our time at camp is that much more fun. No! No! Blue Boy! Blue Boy! Blue Boy! Blue Boy! Blue Boy! Blue Boy! Welcome to camp, loser! Ha ha ha! Ooh! What are you looking at? You got a problem? Just as I thought. I'm having an epidermal reaction. I'm never going to survive this summer. Excuse me. Do you mind? The potassium sorbate makes me break out into a rash. Well, well! What do we have here? Hmm... a new cabinmate. Welcome to the Pig Hut. Appropriate, wouldn't you say? Where are my manners? Introductions are in order. That's Rodman, the hypochondriac. Cruz, the social misfit. Bite me! You've already met Griff, the human vacuum. And I'm Frank... camp smart ass and all-around stud. And you are? My name's Andy. Let's give Andy a big Pig Hut hello. Is that spirit or what? Who's he? We're not sure. We call him Boner. I think he's dead. Nope. He's alive. He just scored. Man, this camp sucks! This cabin sucks. All you people suck! Well, think that about sums it up. This is going to be one swell summer, kid. Testing... Oh! Whoa. Testing, testing, 1, 2, 3. Kamp Kipperman is a very important time in your lives, allowing you to explore your innermost selves amongst the beauty of the natural world. And to help you on your journey, our specially trained Kamp Kipperman Counselors. Hey, guys. What was that? Gentlemen... you're blocking my rays. Tell me... is camp just starting or just ending? It's the first day. Duh! Duh! All right. Haven't missed anything. What bunk you guys from? The Pig Hut. Very good. I'm Swackback, your counselor. Geez! Oh, God! Wait... ooh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Ooh, I'm picking up some vibes! Ohh... ohmmmmm. One of you has been chosen to meet her. Meet who? The Girl of Grady Lake... an amazing 16-year-old goddess. One glance causes sailors to wreck their ships, and if you get too close, she disappears like smoke. But legend has it if you can kiss her, the Girl of Grady Lake will be yours forever. My kind of woman. Let the journey begin. Did you guys check out those dorks from the Pig Hut? What a bunch of losers. Isn't there one decent guy in camp? Yeah. There's Troy. Troy? Give me a break. I'm sick of these jerks. I just want a guy who will listen instead of talking about himself. It ain't gonna happen here! As long as I'm your counselor, there's no monkey business. Yes, ma'am. "Yes, ma'am." No boys, no dates, no kissing, no... touching, no even looking. Oh! God, I wish I was young again. In my day, Look out, boy! Whoo! Get down. Get down. Those, gentlemen, are girls... Our sole reason for living. Quit hogging them, man. I want to look. Come on. Careful, boys. Looking at girls is just like looking at the sun. Stare too long, they'll burn your eyes. Let's go. It's going to be lunch soon. Hey! Aah! Aah! You touch those girls, I'll kill you! It's a perfect sunshiny Kamp Kipperman Day! You know what that means? Activities! I'm in charge of activities this summer, and I believe sports are a metaphor for life. You're either victors, winners, champions, or... by the look of you spastics, humiliated, defeated losers! Now... Uh, sir? I have a medical excuse. It may be best to send me home. You're trying to tell me you're allergic to dirt? Well, so far, just North American dirt, sir. Oh, and certain types of ice. You don't look so good. Really? Let me check it out. Say "ahh." Ahh. Arrooo! Arrooo! Huh, huh! Huh, huh, huh! I don't know about this. Them? They just talk a big game. Gentlemen, play ball! Uhh! I got... I got... Spike it! Uhh! Uhh! Ow! Set me up. Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! I got it! Uhh! Come on. You got him? Hold him. Hold him. O.K. Easy. O.K. Easy. O.K. All right? What were you doing out there? Who? Me? Yeah, you! I was playing volleyball. You call that volleyball? If memory serves me correct, you weren't exactly awe-inspiring. How about an education with this? Why don't you leave him alone? Why don't we go outside? Let's go. I'm going. Let's go, then. I'm gone. Good-bye. Surprise bunk inspection! This place is disgusting! Thanks for noticing. Ha ha ha! Messy footlocker! 10 demerits! Beds not properly made! 10 demerits! Let me guess. 10 demerits? No. Ha ha! 20! So many demerits... so little time. What's that? We're not sure. It may be one of Griff's snacks. Fatty? That boy's so big, he got his own zip code. Food? In the bunk? Everybody knows that's against the rules. Mr. Beckerwood, please confiscate this contraband. No! Anything but that! You can't do that. It's his food. Talking back. 10 more demerits! 10 demerits. You're really killing us, pal. You just bought 50 more demerits, tough guy! That's not fair! That's another 100 demerits! You guys are the biggest bunch of slobs I've ever seen. I'm giving you... 6,347 demerits! Have a nice day. Ha ha ha! It could just be me, but I don't think he likes us. My food! I don't get it. What's the big deal about demerits? "What's the big deal about demerits?" Oh! This is disgusting! This certainly is a great way to work up an appetite. Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! Uhh! ♪ Ohh... ♪ ♪ A little mouse here ♪ ♪ Everything that I hold ♪ ♪ So sacred and dear ♪ ♪ Scrappy's stew ♪ ♪ It's not ready to... ♪ Dinner is served. This looks like the stuff we cleaned off the bathroom floor. Ha ha ha! And then my dad caught the biggest swordfish ever. I'd like to make a toast to my father. To Delbart Beckerwood! Cheers! Hear, hear. There, there. Ha ha! Did you call, Mr. Beckerwood, sir? You forgot to bring my dessert. Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. Yes, sir. Idiots. Idiots! They've got real food. Man, I hate those guys. I'm not hungry anymore. Hi, guys. How are you? Oh! Thanks. Uh, you're... you're welcome. Uh, my... my name's Tiffany. No. Your... Your... Your name's Tiffany. My name's, uh... Tiffany, come on! See you. Hey, loser. Me? Yeah. Yeah, you. What do you think you're doing? Who told you you could talk to my girlfriend? I didn't know she was your girlfriend. He must have... A death wish. But I didn't know! Oh, he didn't know. I'm so sorry. Our mistake. Food fight! Whoa! Whoa! Eww! Ho ho ho! Ha ha! Whoo! Ha ha ha! Hey... you're blocking my rays. You look like a guy in my cabin. I was a guy in your cabin. So where you heading? Madison. How much money you got? About eight bucks. Lesser men started with more. If you only sleep three hours a night, you'll make it back home in about... seven weeks, about the same time camp ends. I hate this place. Well, it's about time. I'm supposed to hate it? This reminds me of a story. It's about this kid, and he was... how old are you? I know what you're doing. The story is really about me. The kid was going to run away, but he decided to stick it out. So he headed back and had the time of his life. I was going to tell you a different story, but I like yours. Give it another try. What do you say? Well, I... Let's get out of here. Uh, camp's this way. Oh, right. I knew that. Mmm... mmm! Mmm... Ohh! Ohh! Oh, no! Rise and shine, campers! Oh! Uhh! Ohh... You boys can swim with the minnows. Sir Frankie here is going after the big one... The Girl of Grady Lake. Now, the water in this perimeter is especially warm. All right, who took a piss? Not me. Don't look at me. Aw, Boner! Let's get out of here. What a pig. Tiff, I got some very good news. You are the most popular girl at camp, and I am, well... me. Anyway, I've decided to make you my permanent girlfriend, official Beckerwood property. Official Beckerwood property? Tiff, Tiff, Tiff, Tiff, Tiff, Tiff. Let me explain. You have to prepare for the future, and your future is with me. Man! This is cool, man! This goes fast! This goes really fast. All right, Lipman! Let's ski, huh? Ski? Uh, look... You're not chicken... are you, Lipschitz? I'll go. There's your skis. You need a safety vest, and... oh! I need a spotter! Let me know when he's ready. He's ready. Well, if you say so. Let's go! Aah! Whoa! Aah! Ha ha ha! Ah ha ha ha! Whoaaahh! Ha ha ha! Ohh! Ohh! Oh! Ahh! Come out, come out, wherever you are! The man of your dreams is here. What am I doing? This is crazy. There's no Girl of Grady... You're for real. Slow down! He says he wants to go faster! Ha ha ha! Aah! Here I come, Tadpoles! O.K. Is everybody ready? Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! O.K. Marco! Polo! Polo! Polo! Aah! Oh! Aah! Huh? Aah! Aah! Ohhhhh! Ha ha ha! So, uh... come here often? Enough about me. Let's talk about me. My name's Frank. I'm a Gemini. I enjoy Cheez Whiz. Ah, going to play hard to get, huh? Ah ha ha! Whoa! No more! No more! He wants more! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Speed is our friend! Aah! No! No! No! No! Oh, no! No! No, no, no, no! No! No! Aah! Wow! Uhh! Uhh! Yeah! How did he do that? Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! All right! Come on! Let's go! Uh! Wow! That was cool. Huh. That was Andy? Wow! What bunk is that guy from? He's from the Pig Hut. Good job, bro. You know what this man has done? Mr. Lipman has set the standards for the Pig Hut. We no longer need to just try and survive. A man's home is his pig pen. You know, it's not so bad. I say we fix it up. We couldn't completely disinfect it, but it's livable. And it's close to the dining hall. Yeah. Cruz, what do you think? Well, if we got to stay here, let's try it. Ahh... Oh! What? Mamacita! All right. I'll see your 40... and I raise you 30. Wait. I don't have no more dough. That's all right, Scrappy. I'll spot you 30. All right. I have one... two... three... four jacks. Oh. I got a 6 and... four queens. Wait a sec. How am I going to pay you back? I'm sure we could work something out. Yeah. Ha ha ha! Here goes nothing. Check this out! Rocketed to number one with their hit single... Wow! Wow! The band will perform in an outdoor concert... This is cool. This is great. The band will return to the studio shortly to record a new album. Whoa! Whoa! What the... Swackback? All who dare... follow me. Hey, guys. Guys. Ohh... Uhh... Come on. Hey, maybe we should... Silence! You're forbidden to talk once in the Sacred Circle of the Swine. Only grunting is allowed until you are officially recognized. What I have seen the past month has astonished me. Never before in all my worldly exploits have I witnessed such collective acts of swinery and hoggishness. But the question is, do you have what it takes to be a Pig? Well... do you? Very good! You have resurrected the mighty memory of the Pigs, and now, to claim your heritage, you must wallow. Cool! Whoa!

What woman can resist the Capulski Charm? I've covered all the bases... Food, music... of course, me. Oh! Well, well, well. What took you so long? I've had some hors d'oeuvres prepared. Do you have a name? That's all right. We'll have enough time to talk later, seeing as we'll be together forever... as soon as I kiss you! Hey, wait. You forgot something! Me! Excuse me! Yoo-hoo! Hello? Please? Hey, come back! Looks like you need some help. Tiffany. Here. Put your arms out. I'll stack. Why are you helping me? I thought you were Beckerwood's girlfriend. Oh, God. Why does everybody do that? Do what? Assume I belong to Troy. I hate that. I'm not his girlfriend. He says you are. Well, he's wrong. You mean that you're... Oh! Tiffany! I got to go. See you.

Let's give it up for Daisy, guys. Let's get down to business. It's ghost story time. Boo! Boo! You guys think you've heard it all, huh? You never heard this one. He was known as the stewmaker. He had a little roadside diner that was especially noted for its succulent stews. Chefs from all over the world tried to figure out the recipe but could never come up with the secret ingredient. Then one cold, rainy night, this minibus with the country's four spelling-bee finalists pulled up to the diner. Ching! Ching! The door sounded. "What will it be?" The kids jerked their heads around. There he was... the stewmaker, a patch over one eye. "Four cheeseburgers?" the kids answered. The stewmaker smiled, revealing a gold front tooth. "Why don't you try my stew? It's excellent." And so the stewmaker served up four piping-hot bowls of his world-famous dish. The kids swirled their spoons around in it until one of them felt something chunky. He fished it out. It was a human eyeball! There was the stewmaker, a meat cleaver above his head! They raced into the bathroom and locked the door. The stewmaker yelled to them, "Before the night is through, "I'll make stew out of you! Ha ha ha!" Crash! The stewmaker broke down the door, raised his cleaver, and stormed inside, hacking and chopping and slicing and dicing and chopping and dicing! The kids never made it back home. No one ever saw the stewmaker again, but folks who stopped by the next day couldn't help but notice how special the stew tasted. Eww! Eww! That was so lame! Yeah. I nearly peed in my pants. Those who don't believe eventually suffer the consequences. ♪ Nobody likes my songs ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Nobody likes my songs ♪ ♪ Somebody likes my songs ♪ ♪ Somebody likes my songs ♪ ♪ Really, really likes my singing ♪ Come on.

I thought I'd warn you, tonight's the Wolves' annual panty raid. You are not my boyfriend, and it looks like somebody already beat you to it. Well, if it isn't Bunk Retardo. We've noticed what you've been up to. You can play around with your stupid panty raid. That doesn't mean you can hang with the big boys. You guys are the stuff we wipe off the bottom of our shoes. Gum? Pretty brave there, aren't you, fat boy? Fat boy? That's it? I expected something better from you, like maybe lard-ass or flubber-gut. Or what about, "There goes the Goodyear Blimp"?

Tonight is our Kamp Kipperman Dance, a gala evening of fun, food, and frivolity. Heh heh. She's out there. I can feel it. There's only a week left of camp, and I can barely talk to Tiffany. Hey, you know about women. You know what to say to them, right? Yeah. It's simple. See, first you got to butter them up and tell them the stuff they want to hear, like, "Your eyes are like pools of sapphires." Your hair smells like a bed of gardenias." That's what they want to hear? Trust me. I know women. At the dance tonight, just walk up and tell her. She'll be putty in your hands. Yeah, but what about Beckerwood? He'll kill me if I even talk to her. Only if he sees you. Got it. O.K., everybody. Welcome to the big Kamp Kipperman Dance, where you'll have the time of your lives. You're going to have a blast tonight! You're going to rock. You're going to rumba. You're going to have a blasting ball! Yoo-hoo! Hello. Told you those losers wouldn't show. Hey, Tiff, sweetheart. How you doing? Uh... Troy, hi. Um... I'm just going to go get some punch. Hey, you're reading my mind. I am dying of thirst. Bring me some, too. She loves me. You know. Psst! Tiffany! Hey, Tiffany. Andy, what are you doing? I heard Troy's on the warpath for you. Well, that's why I was hoping you could come to... our cabin? Oh... Andy, I don't know. We're having a big party. Well, it's really a Pig Party. You know, actually a big Pig Party. O.K. I'll ask some of the girls. Great! See you there. See you. Welcome, welcome, ladies... to Hog Heaven, where all your dreams come true. It's really beautiful, isn't it? It sure is. It was a great party. You guys did a good job. Your eyes are like puddles of sapphires. What? And your hair smells like a bed of... of... oysters. Oysters. Oysters? You're nuts. You guys are all the same. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Look... that's not what I really meant to say. What I really wanted to tell you is that... is that... I really like you. By cooking with indirect heat, the meat is allowed to roast evenly, creating a tender and savory main course. Immediate consumption is strongly suggested. Sometimes I say something to somebody, and I talk and talk and talk, and they listen, but they don't understand. Do you know what I mean? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You did it! Which line did you use? None of them. I just told her the truth. The truth? And it worked? Come on. Wow. Who'd have thought? Truth. O Girl of Grady Lake, forgive the error of my ways. I must tell you now the whole truth. I need you. I can't live without you. Yeah, that was weak. I'm just not used to this honesty stuff yet, you know? All right. You want the truth? Truth is, I've never had a girlfriend before in my life. Girls mostly think I'm an idiot, a big zero. Sorry I ever wasted your time. Ha ha ha! And then my dad got the biggest trout ever! Swell. You notice something? Like what? Like... like we're the only ones here. I've never met anyone like you before in my life. You're such a good listener. Everybody... Conga! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! What in God's name is going on here? Now, this is a party! Yeah! Yeah! It's an illegal party! It is? Yeah! No, it's not. It's no big deal. All right. O.K. I want to see all the Pigs in my office immediately. Heh heh heh. Ha ha ha! Hey, I hope you guys enjoyed it. Get over there. Ha ha ha! O.K., everybody, quiet down. Quiet! Hey, relax. So, what's the problem? It's an illegal party! This is summer camp, not prison camp. The only thing the Pigs are guilty of is having a good time. Well, it's time they grow up. It's right here in the Kamp Kipperman Conduct Code Book. "Any social function not specif... "specish... "specif... "specifish... Spefip... ". Specifically! "Specifically sanctioned by the camp director "is illegal. "All guilty parties "will be summarily and immediately placed on probation." Ha ha ha! So? So, one more mistake and you punks are bacon! He's right. This probation seems pretty serious to me. Don't you get it? After Pigfest last night, we rule this camp! Fun and games are over. It's time to get serious. Mmm. Mmm. Shhh. Mmm. Mmm. All right. Everybody wake up! Let's just... everybody in! I mean out! I mean up! Just follow me. What's going on? This is what's going on. Never in my 20 years at Kamp Kipperman have I seen such a blatant act of disrespect! Defacing camp property! It's outrageous! Man, who would do such a low-down thing? Hold on. We didn't do this. Tell it to your lawyer, smart guy. That's it! You guys are out of here. What are you talking about? This is pathetic! Pack your things. Your bus leaves at noon. You got to believe me. We... How could you? I didn't. I thought you were different. I guess I was wrong. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! I always knew you were a loser... Andy Pandy! Ha ha ha! Ha ha! Drive carefully. All right, Lipman, move it! Let's move it out! Lipman! Stay up here where I can keep an eye on you. I told you. It's not my fault! I didn't do anything. I'm innocent! You guys are blaming me. Don't blame me. Come on, guys. I knew that sundae was a dumb idea. I didn't hear you complaining when you ate the ice cream. Leave him alone, punk! You were the only one that wanted a stupid Pigfest. It's just about time to go and capture the flag. Yeah. Without those Pigs around. Piece of cake. Then we get down and... And party... with the girls. Oh, God. All this stress... I think I'm having a toxic reaction. Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! You shut up! You shut up! I don't have to shut up! Hey, a naked lady! Where? Aah! Whoa! I want your butts glued to those seats! What a piece of junk! What happened? We're going back. What? What? In case you forgot, we got kicked out. Did you paint the Wolves' cabin? Or you? Or you? We all know that Beckerwood and his fellow buttheads did it. Are we going to let them beat us? Well... Um... If we quit now, we'll be quitters forever. What do we do? We're Pigs... Which means we get meaner and fight harder. We got to pig ourselves up when we're feeling down. So, what are we... Men... or Pigs? You... The key! Aargh! I can't find the key. Uh-oh. All right, quiet down. Quiet. Quiet! Quiet! It's time for Capture-the-Flag! All right. O.K. O.K.! All right! Let's bring on the competitors! We have... the Wolves... and the... Tadpoles? Aw... Aw... Aw... The Tadpoles. Now, the rules are very simple... Whichever team captures the enemy flag and brings it back here first, wins. Of course, that will be us. All right, let the games... begin! Oh, come on. It will be fun! You can get them, Tadpoles. They're just Wolves. Move. Faster than that. Come on, you can do it. Follow this guy! Go ahead. That's it. Ooh, there. Those are the Tadpoles. Look at those little guys go! Now you're moving. Oh! Look how fast they're going! They'll catch them in no time. Don't be afraid. You have nothing to fear but... fur itself. Ha ha! All right, Wolves. Spread out and attack... with extreme prejudice. You're dead, punk. Heh heh! Unh! You're dead. You're dead. Unh! We've cleared Vector 9 Charlie and are approaching Alpha Quadrant Sector. Bring me their flag. 10-4. Those little crybabies wussed out. This will be easier than I thought. I have their flag in my sights. Hey! It's... it's a... Whoa! Pig! Aah! Aah! Aah! It's the Pigs! They're back... and they're mad! Wolves, regroup and prepare to attack! Hey! I'm over here. Come and get me. You're dead meat, fatso. Aah! Aah! Aah! Uh... No guts... no glory. You lose, dude. Ha ha! Aah! A-a-all right, you Pigs. I'm right here. Whoo! Huh? Whoo-aaah! Whoo-aah! Ohh! Frank. Duck. Duck! Come in, Wolf Pack. Come in! You're not so tough when you're all alone, are you? Give it to me! Come on. Please. Please, please don't do this. I thought we were friends. I love you, man. My dad will kill me if I lose Capture-the-Flag. Please. Please. Don't do this. Sucker! I'm going to kill you! Aah! No! Time to bring home the bacon. Yeah! We did it! Ha ha! All right! The chicken-wing toss for next week will be canceled and replaced by the duck chase... uhh... and a limbo. Oh, man! The Pigs are back! All right! Whoa, whoa. Guys, why don't you just... I thought you... What are you doing here? Winning Capture-the-Flag. They can't win. They got kicked out. They messed up our cabin. Troy's right. We didn't do that. They did. You've got no proof! People, settle down! Settle down, people! Boys, settle down. People! People! People! Settle down. Settle down. Uh... Troy? Ah, Tiff. You've finally come to your senses. Yeah. I really have, Troy. Look, you're getting all worked up. Maybe you need to cool off a bit, huh? Hey, wait a minute! That's the same color as the paint that was on the Wolves' bunkhouse. You Wolves painted your own cabin! Ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha! Ha ha ha! I declare that the winner of this year's Capture-the-Flag Competition... The Pigs from the Pig Hut! Yay! Yay! Yay! Pigs. Pigs. Pigs. Pigs. Pigs. Pigs. Pigs! Pigs! Pigs! Pigs! Pigs! Pigs! Pigs! Pigs! Pigs! Pigs! Pigs! Pigs! All right! Yeah! Yeah! Whoo! Pigs! Pigs! Pigs! All right, gentlemen. Look sharp. Here it comes! Say Pig! Pig. Pig. Pig. Yeah! All right! See you next summer, Swack. So long... you Pig. O.K., so I went there. She was there, then she wasn't. But she's not there, and she wasn't there. There she is. Barry! Looking forward to seeing you next summer. Barry. Barry. No. Barry. Barry. No. No! Barry! Barry! Hey, look! It's been a long summer, but a great one... A great, long summer, and I'd like to thank all you parents for getting here so quickly. Dad. Hi. Get in. Uh, Mr. Beckerwood, about my tip... Get a job, you simpering loser. Hey! Need a lift home? I'll let you step on my gas. Ohh... Um... so, uh... I guess I'll see you. Yeah. That's my mom. I guess I'll see you next summer. Oh, um... here's my address. Will you write? Sure. O.K. Bye. Bye. You live in Madison? Yeah. Me, too! See you! Bye. Bye. Hi, Mom! Hi! Mom! Hey. How you doing? I missed you. You did? I missed you. You look pretty good. You have a good time? Yeah. Hey, Andy! I'll be back in a sec. All right. You Pigs! See you next summer. Take it easy. So long, Andy. Oink. See you later, swine. Hey... has anyone seen Frank? No. No. No. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
