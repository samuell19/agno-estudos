Calling on my day off. So it's halfway unofficial. You told me to get in touch with you if any of the people on your list wound up dead. And did you by any chance find bread and wine at the scene? Yeah. You know I wouldn't be able to tell you unless you hadn't brought it up first. Anyway, I'm gonna have to ask you to fly out to New Jersey Detective, you know I'm not a suspect. I'm not even in your country, let alone at the crime scene. Yeah, but you know things about the killings. If you conspire to commit murder you're gonna get the death penalty just like the person who actually did the killings. But you said there were no injuries, that she died of natural causes. Yeah, but forensics might change that story. The only DNA you're going to find is from grapevines that are 2,000 years old. Just come in for an interview. I don't think you did it, but you're the only one that can shed light at this time. If any  of the information I've given you gets documented then I'll be locked up in a mental institution and I will be able to help no one. Okay, then just come and give us the facts that don't sound crazy. I already told you what you needed to know. Go through the list of potential victims contact the police and authorities in their various regions and assign people to protect them. You know the only way law enforcement can devote that kind of  manpower is if you give us more information. I thank you detective for getting in touch with me. I was a fool to think the police would do anything. I will have to make contact with the guardians and have them sent out if they have not already been dispatched. - What are you talking about? - I'm on this call but I am not the only one who has knowledge of these special events. Let me pass, brother. I can't believe you call yourself a protector. Looks can be deceiving. You're not protecting anybody today, protector. I know I don't have any power to stop the zombie. So we don't have to fight. Oh yes I do, the Warriors' Code demands it. You are not a warrior, you're an assassin. Same difference. Look I don't care if you're embarrassed by the way I'm dressed. I could go to church wearing anything that I want to. Don't think you're better than me because you wear expensive clothes. Whatever. Look, I gotta go, somebody's knocking on the door. Holy shit! Yes, that is what I seek. Did you receive Holy Communion today? Yes.. I did. I've been wounded and the only way to heal is to extract the sacred meal from your bowels. Are you really Jesus? As your humble servant I will do whatever you ask. Take off thy clothes. Turn thyself around. Yes. Get thyself down on all fours. Spread up thy buttocks. Ah, yes. Turned thyself around to face me but maintain that position. The Lord giveth and Lord taketh. I will remember you when I come into my tingle. Can you make it not hurt so much while you're.. digging around in my intestines? We all have our crosses to bear. Are you sure that's gonna be enough? I only have one wafer. Did you not hear the story of when I multiplied the loaves of bread? You just.. make sure you multiply it outside of my ass. It is finished. This is my body which has been shed for you. I shall place this on my wound and restore the flesh that was ripped from me. Holy shit! This is a crime scene. Shit. I should've known I wasn't gonna get a signal out here. But I have to tell the police I found a rape victim! Okay. It's alright. You poor woman, I'm so sorry. But before I go.. I have to memorize some of the details because that way, in case someone else comes along and contaminates the evidence I'll have something useful to tell the police. Wonder if this is worth something. Bitch! You crushed my ankle! Let go! Is this what you want? You want this back? Tough shit! I'm gonna sell it and use it to pay for my medical expenses! Well? Well what? Aren't you gonna eat me out? I thought you were gonna blow me first. I just did a fucking strip-tease for you! Oh okay, well.. Go get yourself a garter belt so at least it looks like you put a little bit of effort into it. Uh.. Babe! There's a skeleton in the closet. Are you trying to be funny? I don't have to try to be funny. I am funny. I'm gay. Are you trying to be funny? "I don't have to try to be funny, I am funny." Uh.. Babe, the skeleton came out of the closet. Well then tell him to find you some lingerie. Better yet: tell him to eat you out. I can't believe what I just saw. Then you shall no longer see what you disbelieve. I know you're not going to believe this. but I'm just here to protect you. I really am sorry about the gag. Like I told you, I'm just here to protect you. I need you to sit and listen while I explain things to you. If you weren't tied up I'm sure that you would run away from me when you hear what I have to say. There are forces vying for control. When the new age comes in 2012 it's not the end of the world. It's a transition. And you're of a bloodline that can win the battle. But these forces... these enemies are haunting you. I can't fight them off. I know I may not look it, but I'm just a scholar. But I can't hide you. I know that part of the story may seem crazy, but.. The part that comes now is even nuttier. Are you ready? The druids have raised someone from the dead. And he walks the earth killing everyone of your bloodline. He can't be dissuaded from his course. He was brought to life or reanim-.. or animated! Until he destroys every one of his descendants. You may have heard of the zombie when it was a man. Those who don't know the story call him Yeshu or.. Jesus. I thought you'd be more shocked, you seem very calm. Are you really calm? Really? Thank you. My pleasure. You were telling me that Jesus Christ is a zombie. Do I have that right? Zombie is a long dead corpse of a man whom most people associate with the myth of Jesus. But the gospels are mostly false. They were compiled from a bunch of poorly written and rewritten manuscripts under the supervision of a Roman emperor. That's why there's no anti-Roman sentiment in the stories. Pontius Pilate was portrayed as a fair and nice arbitrator. In real life he was brutal and.. insensitive to the jews. He would've never catered to the mob. The basis of the story was that there was a custom to release a prisoner over passover. There never was such a custom! Thanks for the history lesson, but it really doesn't matter to me what Jesus was or wasn't. You're telling me that these days he's a zombie. And he's coming after me, right? Uh.. to put it simply, yes. Okay. Will you let me say something to test if you're delusional? Surely. I'm hoping, if you're suffering from a delusion, that giving evidence the contrary will snap you out of it. Now, if I give you evidence against your belief do you promise to call an ambulance on yourself? I think I can give you that assurance. Okay. So if I present an argument, and you find some really big stretch to make it work you still have to call an ambulance and let the EMTs decide what should happen next. Yes. Okay. The stories about vampires, and werewolves, and zombies are all mathematically impossible. If a zombie bites a human, who then turns into a zombie. And that zombie bites another person, who also turns into a zombie. And so on and so forth. Then the number of zombies would grow exponentially. And very fast I might add. And quite soon there would be no unaffected humans left. Which would terminate the food source. And all would perish. I understand that zombies are sometimes a symbol for plague. But all plagues die out eventually, and humans win. I think you'll agree that I've listened patiently. And I agree with what you say about creatures contaminating humanity and mathematical probabilities. But.. those are stories. Not real events. The zombie the haunts you does not eat human brains. It does not create other zombies when it bites people. It is a partially mummified corpse that has been animated with magic. I don't even know if it has consciousness or any memory of who it was in its past life. - You read Homer's "The Odyssey"? - No. Well.. According to Homer, the dead are in a trance-like existence. Only when they drink sacrificial blood they can remember their past existence. Okay. I can see you're too coherent to be crazy. I'll go with you. Are you sure? Yes. You speak in a logical manner and you haven't hurt me even though I'm tied up. So you won't hurt me when I'm free. That made me trust you. You are proof that your bloodline will prevail. My name is Michael. As I mentioned earlier, I am a scholar. Well.. - A renegade scholar. - Renegade? That may seem like a rebellious word, but.. to put it simply, I am not a member of any organization. I know about these organizations, but i'm not a member. And how can you protect me? Because knowledge is power. Magda.. Come on. Thank you. Yes, he's feeling much better. Yes, sister Mary, I'll be staying with my brother for a couple of days and then I'll be back in the convent. As also with you. Okay I'll see you soon. Bye. Would you die for me the same way that you think I died for mankind? Would you let yourself get nailed? If you are truly my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ then I will do so gladly. I did not die for you or for anyone else. The Romans stole my story and changed it to suit their political agenda. What you believe to be history is just a stolen myth. Romans stole the Greek pantheon and renamed the Gods. Zeus became Jupiter. Dionysus became Bacchus. When Romans invented Christianity, Bacchus became Jesus. But even the Greeks stole a myth. Crete had different deities before the mainlanders invaded. No, there is only one God. You are a Roman Catholic. The Roman emperor Constantine created your religion. But did you know that Constantine himself never converted  to Christianity? He was a worshiper of a Sun God. I am not the Son of God, I am the God of the Sun. You are a bride of Christ. It's time to consummate the relationship. But you were celibate. Was I? In the gospels I was called "Rabbi". According to the rabbinical laws I have been married. I have two children with Mary Magdalene. And one child with a woman named Lydia. You are not Jesus. You are the beast. And so are you. We shall make the beast with two backs. I have no boner but I know that you are thawing for meat. It's political. This side of the talisman reveals that Yeshu or Jesus belonged to the political party that wanted peace with Rome. Is that why he's called the Prince of Peace? No, that's the American consumerism of religion. No, he was from the Davidic bloodline. He was a king. King of the jews. Well not all jews consider him legitimate. Look, I can't do the whole history in a conversation. But if you don't mind, I do have to think out loud. Sometimes when I hear myself say things, something important may click. Sure. They were a sect of extremists that lived in a remote settlement called Qumran. They held a political supper. What you call "The Last Supper". They were representatives of the Zealot war party. And of the peace party, which Yeshu was a member. Jesus. The Prince of Peace. Or the King of Peace. Yes, if that's easier. They were all to merge into one party if certain prophecies came to pass. And when they did not the peace party was discredited. So he was a king, just not the King of Peace? Judas was at this meal. Was a wanted man at the time. But there was an even more wanted man at the so-called "Last Supper". Jesus. No, it wasn't Jesus. Judas thought he could bargain for his own freedom if he turned in the other fugitive. But the betrayal backfired on him. Like I told you before, Pontius Pilate wasn't a fair man. Is any man who rules really fair? Pilate ordered three leaders to be crucified. At Qumran bribes were paid for a man named Simon. I won't get into his story. But he was an old man. And Jesus was chosen in his place to die. So he didn't die for mankind. He died for an old man. Just pay attention. There was no one to offer bribes for Judas, so he was crucified. And the crucifixions weren't a hilltop spectacle. They were done in an unclean portion of the settlement to add extra insult. There weren't many spectators. And Jesus wasn't crucified in the center, he was at the end. Well at least it was private. You said there weren't many spectators. After a few hours enough of a bribe was collected to have Jesus's execution changed to being buried alive. But it was all a ruse for him to escape. You got all that from a talisman? No. I got that because I've read the Dead Sea Scrolls. Talisman does give me new associations. On this side it talks about Mary Magdalene. The whore? The Romans depicted her as a whore. But she wore the color red for a different reason, sort of like cardinal status. She was the head of a large organization though. I haven't been able to figure out precisely what it is, but I'm willing to bet it was religious. Not Christian. No, not possible. There was no such thing as Christianity when Jesus supposedly lived. Okay whatever, what does it say about Magdalene? It's baffling. It ties her to the Earth Goddess that was worshiped in Crete. The one that predates the Greek pantheon. But she was Jewish, wasn't she? - You ever heard of the term "diaspora"? - No. Never mind then. It's not the word that matters, it's the concept behind it. The main connection between Mary's Jewish identity and Crete is that there were quite a few jews who lived in Greece. - Don't you mean quite a lot? - I don't understand. - Well.. Few is always a small number. It makes no difference whether I say: "here are three pennies" or "here are quite a three pennies". Right, not all expressions are intelligent. It would help if you stopped using stupid expressions when you wanna sound smart. I will. Thank you. As I was about to say, Crete was a society ruled by women. It was well-structured, fun. And not interested in war. It was a compassionate society. Eventually.. it was invaded. And the Earth Goddess was replaced by the Sky Gods. The female run society was replaced by a male dominated one. I don't think I'm gonna be of any help to you. If you keep talking about history I'm probably gonna make some wisecracks. That's not what you want, right? Does history bore you so much? No, but I learned a long time ago that history isn't true. Everything that was recorded had some sort of agenda behind it. There was never any intention to report the truth. A professor told me that. Ever since then I haven't wanted to learn anymore. I mean, all you've been telling me is that the history I've learned isn't true. What makes the history that you know any more true? Let's not argue, Mary. - Is that okay with you? - I'll let you know if you need to shut up. Don't be afraid. I'm not an intruder. What do you call yourself then? You broke in, you're obviously intruding. I know this sounds crazy, you have to come with me. Actually this.. sounds crazy, I had a dream that you're coming. Okay, pack some clothes. I'll wait here. I'm sorry, I just got a couple of questions. In my dream there are two kinds of people coming after me. Do you know anything about the other team? The humans who are coming are going to try to kill me. Are they gonna try to kill me too? No, they'll preserve you for the thing that's coming to eat your soul. How are they gonna try to kill you? They'll first try to defeat me in hand-to-hand skills. Why? They believe in the Warrior's Code. This is stupid. They must've never read The Odyssey then. Greatest warrior, Achilles, renounced the Warrior Code completely. Warriors are so quick to lose their lives to glory. Glory is meaningless in the after life. Or should they say after death? No woman would ever be foolish enough to live by the Warrior's Code. Life is too precious for us. I just got a couple of questions to ask you before I decide to go with you. Are you risking your life for me? Do you think that my life is more important than yours? Do you think that being selfless makes you honorable? Just fulfilling my duty, don't wanna die if that's what you're asking. I think all tourists.. are all evil. They do things for rewards and pretend to care of the greater good. Don't you think it's better to be honest about your intentions? I really don't have any ulterior motives. If that's the way you wanna play the game. So be it. Can you see if I dropped my special necklace by this side of the couch? - I don't wanna leave without it. - Yeah. You fool, I'm one of the assassins. And Jill is dead, you came too late. The zombie came for her. I waited for you so I could destroy and kill you before you attempted to save anyone else on that list. Even the most intelligent man becomes a fool when he gazes upon beauty. Think of the Devil and he shall appear. Oh my god! Your god? I think not. I grow weary of your crime. Forgive me. Actions speak louder than words. Gird up thy loins. What you have made others do, I shall do. Why do you call this a blowjob? The penis is sucked, not blown. The miracle I shall perform this day is that I will blow and inflate the penis until it bursts. What shall be the name of this? Blowup job? Yes. And my magic will keep you alive, suffering and dickless. And you must walk the earth and give all other rapist priests blowup jobs to make it impossible for them and you to ever rape another boy. Do you think that everyone from my bloodline is dead? Sure seems that way. But if there is anyone left alive we owe it to that person to do for them what I've done for you. And law enforcement probably has you on their list. Yeah, I've been thinking about that actually. They could be waiting for me, hiding in one of the homes. You said that they won't protect anyone on the list until a lot of people end up dead. We found out a lot of those people are dead. Surely the police have taken more protective action by now. Maybe you don't even need to protect these people anymore. You feel selfish if you're the only person on the list whom I saved? If you fall into a police trap, you aren't gonna be protecting anyone. I don't understand why none of the protectors from the other various organizations have been able to save anyone. You ever hear that Jesus is your personal Saviour? Of course. Actually, I'm sick of hearing it. Well, Zombie Jesus is more like your personal savour. For some reason he steals the souls of his victims. It's the reason I haven't been able to figure out why. Maybe the Gods feed on souls. The Greek Gods used to feed on the smell of burning flesh. Maybe the zombie's feeding on the energy of these souls to keep itself animated. It's that gonna hurt? I mean when he does it to me. I don't think so. I mean, souls aren't physicals. Pain is physical. But I promise I'll do everything I can to keep that from happening. I would die for you. You would? Why would you do something like that? Because you are the last of your kind! I know I'm not much of a barrier, but hopefully this is. Leave me alone! I left you once. The pain has never left me. - So you can be hurt. - You know who likes that. Mary, you have remembered me. Yes, I remember how you used your power on me, at my apartment! That is unless you're a different zombie. You all look alike to me. Deeper in the past have you ever dreamed of another life? Of another man in your life? Stay back. Do I remind you of someone? You are someone else. I can see your soul, but it sleeps in forgetfulness. I will awaken you, Mary. Go! Oh no, not again. So how do I know that this is really wine? - What else could it be? - You know, Christ's blood. That's actually from the Greek mythology. In fact the gospels took a lot from the ancient Greeks. Plagiarism was pretty common back then, it ran rampant. - Shut up! - That's pretty rude. You told me to stop you whenever you talk too much about history. I see. Let me tell you one thing that I'm sure you'll find interesting. Bread and wine had a different meaning to the Greeks. Bread was given by the Earth Goddess. You know, grain given from the earth. But you said that the Greeks worship the Sky Gods. Yes, but when one people's takes over another the takeover is more successful if the subjugated people are allowed to keep some of their beliefs. I remember reading that when Rome took over the Christian religion that they blended some of the pagan practices into catholicism. Very good, Mary. Is that my influence? Well, you do have a way of making these things stick. Thank you. Wine. Wine was the Sky Gods' gift. Dionysus taught humans how to make wine. Bread sustained life. Wine made it worth living. I's said that it's the.. only cure for sorrow. There are other cures for sorrow. That was my blood that was shed for you. You don't really wanna kill her. You could've many times, but you didn't. Wait. I remember now. I never stopped loving you. You drank the sacrificial blood, you remember your past life. No, Mary. Your life is what you make of it, not what you once were. I died before you came back to me. You can have the earthly life that we should've had. Take my hand. No, Mary, it's a trick. You can't go against the spell that animates him. I am his true love. Nonsense. Dionysus was terrible at relationships. Some men write stories for others to read. And some men believe what others write. There's gotta be a way to satisfy your orders and still make everybody happy. - There's got to be a loophole. - I have thought long on this. If you kill her your own bloodline will be lost. She's your descendant! I'm not talking about the Mary you once knew, I'm talking about the Mary of the present. If you kill her the Sky Gods will lose. You're a Sky God! The druids fooled Rome once. They let Rome believe that they were wiped out. But they hid. Hid for centuries. Until now! They made you into their puppet, but you could be their master. In another life I did indeed achieve high rank in the druidic sect. Maybe that's the loophole that will serve us. Use your ancient rank, you can command them. Stay out of the affairs of the Gods. But you're in love with her. You forget that I can raise the dead. I will not do the same for you. I have dreamed of life with you. A life in the flesh. There is a way for us to be together but there's a price of pain. You'll hate me for it. But great pain's never fully remembered. As you endure it, I will not seem to pass. When it is over it will just be a dull memory. Trust me, I know this. Foolish mortals bow for the dominion of the new age. Your ignorant protector makes me a humiliated God. Degraded into serving men who want to destroy my bloodline. Let the bloodline perish. It matters not to immortals. The Gods are the Gods! And the ages of men are only of significance to man. Whoever reigns in the age of Aquarius, reigns only over man. But remains the same in the plane of the Gods. The only place where status matters. I loved her. Tomorrow is the day upon which so many have hung their hopes. You have left your body by then. I did not take your soul. nor will I. You'll die a death worthy of legend. And then I shall descend from the skies as a man and I will resurrect you as a woman. The druids will have won. But it shall not matter to us. We shall know the happiness that was taken from us long ago. Dionysus! No! Michael, you don't know what you're doing. Leave! Alexander the Great brought Greek mythology to Jerusalem. Spare him. He can't save me, I know I have to die. Followers of Dionysus drank wine and called it his blood. He was born of a virgin. His childhood was in danger. He raised someone from the dead! They believed that if they followed him they would  have salvation. He died in excruciating death. Went to the underworld. He returned as an immortal. Almost everything written about Jesus was first written about Dionysus. Michael. Please shut up. Dionysus You had a bride, Ariadne. She was human. But Zeus approved of her so much he made her immortal. Michael. Stop. Go while you still can. Ariadne & Dionysus. Are there parallels there to Mary Magdalene and Jesus? Mary died before Jesus. Was it natural? Or did Jesus approve of having her killed? Dionysus consented to having Ariadne killed. Because she took another lover, Theseus. The day is not yet over. I know the story of how Dionysus died as well. I have the talisman. You may not be the only immortal that walks the earth. I will call the titans. The titans stole your thunder once. And they will do it again! No! What have you done? It's his time. So does mine. I'm finished. Farewell, beautiful face. Without you, the way to compose sweet music is forgotten. The Gods work in mysterious ways. You're quoting that from Euripides. That's where I first encountered it. In his play - "The Bacchae". You know most Christian expressions were stolen from Greek plays. I was referring to the seeming paradox of my  victory. The Earth Goddess has won. Women shall rule. Societies will be compassionate and war shall be forgotten. But you're of the bloodline of Jesus (or Dionysus). That was what you call a smokescreen. The zombie did not heed his own words. Humans meant nothing in the contest. All that happened was meant for me to become deified. - Sparagmos? - Yes. An excruciating death was necessary for me to become immortal. Yes, but when Dionysus underwent sparagmos he was already half god and half human. As was I. I am the daughter of a Goddess. My father was human. Why didn't you do something in the past when you were Mary Magdalene or Ariadne? You forget that immortals do not feel time like you do. All that happened in the past was in preparation for this day. Hey, that's why you kept telling me to shut up. You were afraid Dionysus would figure out the plot. That's right. It's not easy to fool a God. Did you know he really loved you? Yes, I was never false. But he betrayed me. Whichever story you hear: Magdalene or Ariadne There is betrayal of my love. But you You came for me even though you knew you'd be killed for doing so.
