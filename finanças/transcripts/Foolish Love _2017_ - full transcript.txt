--== McEphie ==-- [upbeat music playing] [woman] Thank you, Mom! Sorry Mom, I'm really occupied right now. I can't go home to Sasmuan yet. Mom, when I have free time, I'll make sure to come home. -[mom] Take care! -Thanks, Mom! -[mom] Happy Birthday! -Thanks, Mom. Bye! [chuckles] [sighs] My mom greeted me. [chuckles] Are you okay? -Hm? -Yes, I'm okay. Come on, Junjun. You should have come earlier. I could have introduced you to my friends. Especially my two best friends, Lea and Natasha! You know, they are very curious about what you look like. What do you think I told them what you look like? Of course, I told them you are handsome! [giggles] Oh, are you really okay? Let's stop this. Stop what? What we are talking about! [sighs] Junjun, we are not talking. I'm the only one talking. You're just listening. Can we… not go home together? Oh! You're not paying for my fare anyway. I'm the one who's always paying. Virgie… I am gay! [lively instrumental playing] Huh? [scoffs] Come on! You are not gay. You're just confused. [in English] They say, "Confusion is the beginning of wisdom." That's why I am here. To help you overcome your confusion. Virgie, you only make me more confused. Can you please! Can we just be friends? Friends? Ouch! Junjun! Junjun! Junjun! [Virgie shouting in background] Junjun! [grunting] Junjun! Junjun! Junjun! Junjun! [sobbing] [indistinct chattering] [melancholic music playing] [gate clicks shut] [shrieks] [discouraged laugh] What's wrong with my life! Also my cake. Really? The only thing that I have for my birthday! What the heck! It's useless! No one to celebrate with, and now I don't have anything to eat! When you have all the bad luck in the world… Everything is ruined! My day, my birthday! Also, the only thing I can eat today! [in Taglish] Happy Birthday, Virgie! Happy Birthday. I hope you're still happy! [crying] Oh! And you! You're also dead? Can you please stay alive? You guys are all I have left. [phone ringing] Who is this? -[in English] Hello? -[woman] Hi, Vi! How's your birthday? Did Junjun confess? -Yes. -[woman] Finally. Praise God! I told you so. Just give him time. He will give in. [in English] I'm so happy for you, Vi! [sobbing] Come on, Vi. You've been waiting for it too long. What's important is that he already confessed. Yes, he confessed! He confessed that he is gay! [woman] What? My God! What kind of men are they! If not a player, then they are gay! Sensible men are extinct! I don't know what to do. I don't know why this is all happening now on my birthday. [sobbing] [Vi reading] [gentle music playing] Saint Jude, please… it's okay if he's ugly. It's okay if he's stupid. It's okay if he's a bit vulgar. Can you please grant my wish? [gentle piano music playing] Reynaldo. [young Virgie] You're too slow! [young Rey] Wait up! Wait for me! -Ouch! it hurts! -Did it hurt? -Ouch! -Hey, you have a bruise! I am okay. It's okay. Come on. Let's sit. [bright music playing] Rey, why? Because you are the most beautiful girl in the world. Really? [shouts] Reynaldo! [gasping] Rey. Imagine you only found out he is gay after you are married. Mm-hm. What's this? "My Husband's Lover"? -[Natasha chuckles] -I will still accept him. Stupid! Are you desperate? [gulps] I am in my thirties. In a few years, my uterus will be dry. You know, the thirties is still young. [in English] True! My doctor already talked to me. I have a retroverted uterus. When I get to my thirties, tick-tock, tick-tock. It's like having a time bomb on my uterus. You know what? Don't worry too much. It will come. The one who's meant for you! [clearing throat] Me, I believe in destiny. Imagine. From Canada, coming here to the Philippines, he noticed me! -Oh my God! -[Virgie giggles] That is why, Vi, hold on. You told me before that Reynaldo loves you. Maybe he is your destiny. [sighs] But we were young then. The last time I saw him was at our elementary graduation in Sasmuan. The last I heard of him was he's staying in Quiapo. Oh? Someone saw him selling pirated DVD's! Yes? Really? Then why don't you go there? -[boss] Show it to me right away. -It's our boss! Our boss! [woman] Yes, ma'am. I will give it to you later. [woman] Oh my, I'm so tired of these reports! [boss] I called you guys because I wanted to acknowledge our employee of the month. -[in English] Wow! -Thank you! Ms. Lea. [in English] Thank you, sir. -Congratulations! -Thank you. Thank you! [chuckles] [chuckles] -[in English] Enough! -[Lea] Thank you! Enough. Enough. That's enough. [in Tagalog] I hope that we can look the same. [everyone laughing] -Why? -Thank you. -It's amazing! -[woman] Amazing. We should all emulate Lea Angela Crisostomo. [applause] Thank you! We should not rest assured. There is a lot of competition in the beauty products industry. [in English] In the past three months, our sales went down by 10%. Do you have any suggestions? [in English] I'm talking to you, Virginia Dimaculangan. Any ideas? You are the head of sales! [in English] Uh, well… Why don't we launch a new ad campaign? Why don't we get a… endorser. -[in English] Like? -Like… -Kris Aquino. -That's okay… -She's expensive! -Precisely, ma'am. Kris Aquino is expensive, and people will surely love us. Yes, that's right! [in English] Are you trying to imply that I am not an effective endorser of my own beauty products because I am cheap? Oh no… That's what I was telling you. That's why I don't want to speak at our meetings. You'll give suggestions, but our boss will still disregard it. But you know, I know who's excited about our next meeting! -[gags] -[woman giggles] [Lea] I was just lucky getting the employee of the month. That's not what I was saying. I am referring to the lascivious look of our boss's son! You're too malicious. -Oh my. -[gags] Come on. Let's just focus on this. [Virgie] What's that? -Look at this. -Oh. We will really waste our time looking for that person? Oh my! How will we know? There are more than a hundred Reynaldo dela Cruz. [woman] True! We were so young when we got separated. He is 32 years old now. -And I'm sure he looks different. -Mm-mm. -Vi, he's staying in Quiapo, right? -Quiapo, yes. Let's look at the ones residing in Quiapo. -How will we do that? -There… That's right. Oh! [in English] One cappuccino for my leading lady. What are you talking about, my leading man? [in English] This is already over our monthly budget. I can drink instant coffee. That's a gift, love, because you're employee of the month! Come on. It's for both of us. I know you're working hard. Hm, it's so good. There. You know I'll do anything for you. [in English] Hm. You're so sweet! Thank you! I have a surprise for you. [in English] Oh my God! [giggles] [gasps] [in English] You mean you're not going back to Canada? [in English] No, I'm not. I'm going to marry you after I graduate, okay? [romantic music plays] -You two are so sweet! -[cheering and applause] [giggles] [crowd applauding] What kind of proposal is that? Installment? The ring comes after the graduation. If I was Lea, I would say yes to the one I love. Whether there's a ring or not. [chuckles] And where the heck is this person? Natasha! That is why we will look for Reynaldo. Because I am sure that they are soul mates. -Just like my JC. -Mm-hm. -Right? -[mocking] "My JC." My JC! [JC] Come on. Another shot! Okay! Hey! What's that, Lea? We're in the middle of the bridge. Stop your selfie. Come on! Okay, sorry! Come on? Let's go! [Virgie shouts] Hurry up. [Lea] Here? Okay. Um, excuse me. Can I ask you something? What is it? I saw this on Facebook. It says down the bridge I will find Rey dela Cruz. It says he is a tricycle driver. Do you know him? -Ah, Rey dela Cruz. -Yes. Rey, get up. Someone's looking for you. This is it, Vi! It's me. Why? That's Rey dela Cruz. No, just keep on playing. Thank you! [man] Turn at the corner and then second door. It's nearby. Thank you! Maybe this time, this is it! [Lea] Thank you. Come on. Let's hurry up. Maybe this is him. [Lea] Rey dela Cruz. Second door. Maybe this is it. -Good evening! -What is it? -Is Rey dela Cruz here? -Rey dela Cruz, my brother! -Why? What is it? -That's you. [exclaims] Vi, does he have cleft lips? -Rey dela Cruz doesn't have cleft lips. -Anyway, we'll go ahead. Thank you! -Thank you, guys! -Good bye! I am Rey dela Cruz. Vi, he's too young? I know. He could be my son. Okay. Thank you. -Thank you! -Thank you. -Can we ask something? -Of course. Does Rey dela Cruz live here? I am Rey dela Cruz. Why? What do you need from me? [giggles] Vi, is he the one? -Hi. -Yes, yes? What are you looking for? If you are looking for leaves, I have plenty of that! For menstruation, for abortion, bathe for new mothers. What are you looking for anyway? We're not looking for leaves. We're looking for a person. Oh my, you are looking for a person, but I am selling leaves and roots. -Oh my. -Yeah. Thank you. -I'm sorry. -Okay. -Thank you. -It's okay. -Excuse me, Miss! Miss! -Yes? Miss, come back. Who are you looking for again? -[sighs] -Um… Rey dela Cruz. You must be a police agent. -No! No! -Are you sure? Promise? Okay, wait. -Rey! Rey! -This is it! Rey! Rey! Hurry up! Why? Miss, he is Rey dela Cruz! Isn't it amazing? There he is! -He is the one you're looking for. -What do you need? He lacks some height. -[mumbles] -Vi. He is little. Yeah. Wait. -You are Rey dela Cruz? -Yes. Why? Is there a problem? [chuckles] No, there's no problem. The leaves here look great. -Will you buy them? -We'll go ahead. Thank you. -You're both beautiful. -Until next time. Thank you! Thank you! [man speaks English] Bye! [sister] Why are you in a hurry? You know that I am not getting any younger. Virgie, love is not a journey. Marriage is also not a journey. You're telling me that because you know you're not getting in. You reached your destination. How about me, Sister? Every time I go to a family reunion, they ask the same question. "How many children do you have?" Even Mom. She's asking when I will give her a grandchild. That's why I don't want to go to Sasmuan. Almost all our relatives ask the same. Why don't you pray? Sister. Sister, I think I've already prayed almost every prayer that I know. And I always pray to St. Jude. Everything has its right time. Sister, when will my time come? You might know when. Virgie, I'm just a nun, not a prophet. When mom dies, I will be alone. I don't have any siblings. Mom only has one sibling, but you're a nun. You know. If I weren't a nun, I would have pulled your hair. You speak about your mom's death even though she's strong and healthy. Come. Maybe it's better if you take a break. Visit my sister in Sasmuan. Don't worry. I will pray for you. So that I can find Rey? So that you will follow God's plan. Sister, that's a sin! I was telling you that. Come here. Thank you. [mom] Why are you coming home? There's no occasion. Why? Don't you want me to come home? When it was your birthday, you told me you're going home. Now you are coming home? You're sulking. Oh no! Why should I sulk? Mom, you're sulking. I know you. Just take care of your job there. Don't come home yet. I'm not ready. Ready? Why should you be ready? I'm just coming home! Hm. Just don't. What do you mean? Hello? Hello? Mom! [romantic music playing] [man] Hey! Anybody riding San Fernando! [indistinct chatter] [man] Nobody left anything? Can I? [gasps] Lord, is this a sign? [in English] St. Jude, this must be love! Miss, what did you say? -Did I said anything? -Nobody left anything? [passenger shouting] [romantic music playing] [man] You're from Angeles? [Virgie] No, Sasmuan. Ah, before it was Sexmuan. It's really Sasmuan. Americans can't say it right. That's why it was Sexmuan. When it was the American era. [gasping] That's amazing. Which one? The Americans. How come? They can't even pronounce Sasmuan. Well, you're right. Um. I am Val. Virgie. -It's fascinating. -[gasping] Which one again? This moment. You're Virgie, I am Val. You're V, I am V. It's fascinating. [gasps] You're too fast. [giggles] Do you have a boyfriend? I don't have a girlfriend either. You're doing this hastily. [giggles] [man] We're stopping quickly. Just getting something. Anybody going to the C.R., taking a pee? Okay, I'll just take a pee. -[man] Quail eggs! Macaroon! Candies! -Val! Do you like quail eggs? -Anybody wants to buy? -Two, please! Quail eggs! Macaroon! Candies! My wallet! My cellphone! My bag was ripped! My bag! -Help me, please! Pickpocket! -Quail eggs! Macaroon! Candies! Please stop him! Pickpocket! I thought you were my destiny! You're good-looking but you're a con artist! You're a thief! Where are my things? Give me back my things! Give it to me! Give it to me! Take him! Mom! Mom! -Where is my mom? -Inside, doing her makeup! Mom! She should have waited for me! [sobbing] I was just talking to her. -I don't know… -Do you know her? That's the reason why she seems to be mad at me. It seems she's saying goodbye! Mom! Mom! -[sobbing] Mom! -[clamoring] [flamenco music playing] Mom? Mom! Mom! [flamenco music continues] Mom, come on! Mom! [moans] What's this? Mom! Come on! What's happening to you! What is it? You've been calling me, yelling at me! You seem crazy! We're practicing ballroom. What is it? Before I forget. This is Ivan, my partner. Ivan, this is my daughter Virgie. Nice to meet you, madam. I remembered. Good thing you came. Just help yourself. We still have a ballroom to attend to. -Guys, come on. We're going to be late! -Let's go. -Just take care of the house, okay? -Mom, wait! -Mom! Mom! -Come on, girls! Our tricycle service is already here! Mom, wait up! Virgie, my daughter, I need to go. We're in a hurry. Mom! Mom! [mom] Lock the gate! I'll come back soon. -Come on! Hurry up! -Mom… [flamenco music playing] So that's the reason you don't want me here. You turned our house into a club. You danced until dawn. Don't you feel ashamed? And you invited men here. About Ivan, I'm not ashamed of him. How about him? Did you ask him if he feels ashamed of you? No! No. Mom. [sighs] Mom, you are old. You guys have a 30-year gap. My God! Look who's talking! And why? Don't elderly people have the right to be happy? And you know, in love, age doesn't matter at all! Mom, that's a rationalization. Can you please stop scolding me? I'm still your mom! And stop calling me your mom! You only call me Mom when you're dramatic. You usually call me Mommy! What is this? A telenovela? You're becoming like your friends! Thirty years… Since your Dad died, I never looked at other men. It's because I promised him. But last month, I dreamed of him. He said, "Corazon. I want you to be happy." But I didn't understand what he said. Until I met Ivan. Your Dad wants me to be happy. Why don't you? Mom! My child! I thought you were staying here for a few days? The office called me. I have lots of work to do. Is this because of Ivan? My child. Being alone is not easy. You're not going to be lonely. You have Ivan. My child. My child. My child! My child. Wait! Leave your house in Manila. Stay here instead. I don't want to disturb you. Virgie. Even if I am lonely, at least you're happy, Mom. There you go again! I will pull your hair! I'll go ahead. Virgie. Virgie, wait! Virgie, wait! Virgie! I'll go ahead, Mom! [light music playing] Rey, why? Because you are the most beautiful girl in the world. [man] Miss, we're here, in Cubao. Miss, we're here, in Cubao. Reynaldo? Forgive me, but I'm not Reynaldo. We're in Cubao already. [in English] Sorry. We're here. Cubao! [Virgie] I hope we can sell all of that. It's because it looks really cheap. Just look at the model. She's also cheap. That's why no one buys it. Let's just eat chocolate. Okay. Let me have some. The only reason your boyfriend bought you expensive chocolate is to make up for not buying you an engagement ring! Still the same issue? Let's just move on. JC is such a sweet person. You know, he woke up early just to give me this chocolate. Or maybe his parents sent him an allowance. He's not asking for his parents' support. That's why he's studying here. [in English] And he's staying because he loves me! [giggles] -The chocolate taste so good! -And you believed him? You know, guys, a while ago, Ernesto cooked me breakfast. -Really? -You know why, guys? It's because I found he saved my name as "Joseph" on his cellphone. [bouncy music playing] Maybe it's just a mistake. No! I know what he is doing. He's showing off to his girls that he is single. He's trying to escape. [in English] But wait… There's more! There's more? I found out today that he's not wearing his wedding ring anymore. -Oh my… -Maybe he's just afraid of being robbed. -Could be. -You know, he should really be afraid! Because I'm going to give him what he deserves! Speaking of finding someone, I sent a message to other Reynaldo dela Cruz's on Facebook. [sighs] Some replied, but they said they're not him. Didn't I tell you that finding Reynaldo is useless! It's been two weeks. Have you achieved anything? None! [woman] Watch where you're going. It's raining. -Bye! -Bye, sis! -Hi, Sir Erickson. -Hi, Lea. Did you like the chocolates? -That's from you? -Yes, of course! [in English] Thank you, sir! It's nothing. And don't call me "sir". Erickson is better. How will you go home? Do you want me to take you? Oh! -I'll take you home. -No, thank you. I'm waiting for someone. Alright. How about dinner sometime? If it's okay with you? Hi, leading man! -[lip smack] -Leading man, this is Erickson, my boss. This is JC, my boyfriend. [sighs] Erickson. Okay, I'll go ahead. Alright. Take care! -[car lock beeps] -Let's go? [Virgie] Lord, I'm looking for Rey, but I can't find him. That's why I will not ask for a boyfriend anymore. I accept your plans for me, Lord. Even if I will be single for the rest of my life. [eventful music playing] [in English] Thy will be done, Lord. Thy will be done. [sister] Are you sure? Sister, there is what you call late vocation? Virgie, you don't want to be a nun just because you can't find Rey or just because you can't find a boyfriend. I already prayed for it. It seems that it's God's plan for me. Did he tell you that face to face? Come on, Sister! I am serious. You know what? I think you need to pray again. You need to discern. Again! What does God want you to do? Am I right? Or maybe you just need retail therapy. [Virgie narrating] This is an inefficiency! A failure! [Virgie continues narrating] [rain drizzling] [rain drizzling] [thunder crashing] Mister! You're all wet. You might want to come to my house first. It's right here. [romantic music playing] Here's something to keep you warm. Forgive me. I only have coffee. Is your towel fine? Why were you sitting in the rain? Don't be offended. Are you mute? Here, it might rain again. You can take this with you. Thank you. You're not mute? Wait! Mister! Mister, what's your name? [Virgie continues narrating] [man mutters] [Natasha] You let him in? It was raining. You just don't get it! What if he was a thief? Friend, I tell you this. He's too handsome to be a thief. That's great! That's great! Maybe he's rich. -He's just looking for a place to shelter. -Here we go again, Lea. You cannot see a person's personality by his looks. What if he was a serial killer? Sir, here's my payment. Come on! I just did that noble thing because it was raining. Noble thing? Or you have other things in mind? It's just a noble thing. [Natasha] You're crazy! Lord, I'm sincere about being a nun. But why should I meet…? What is his name again? Anyway, whoever he is, Lord. St. Jude, help me. Give me a sign. If I see him again, it means being a nun isn't my calling. [gentle music plays] Hey, what's up! How are you? I am doing great. Why? Sorry, I thought you're someone I knew. [in English] Miss. Miss! You're frowning again. I'm so pissed off with that old woman! Did you know? She almost did not give me my maternity leave! She told me that I give birth every year anyway. It's Ernesto's fault. He doesn't do any good to me. Shh. It's hard to ask for an advance salary now. Good thing I was able to ask Sir Erickson for money. Good thing. Why did you ask Erickson for money? For my mom's check-up! How about your boyfriend? You know, he just looks rich because he is a foreigner, but he doesn't have money. That's what I'm talking about! That's who you are! You see, Lea, life is hard now. Be practical! -You're hungry again! -[baby crying] Can you stop fighting? Where the heck is your father? He just knows how to make kids but never takes care of them! [baby crying] Give it to your brother. You still have more toys! [whimpering] Ernesto! [whimpering] Give me a minute, baby. Wait a minute. Stay there. Yes, I know. Wait for me. [phone ringing] Shh. Yes, I know. Give it to your brother! [phone ringing] [in English] Hello, Joseph. Sorry, I got baby tired. [woman] Just go out some other time. Bye! -[whimpering] -[baby crying] [whimpering] It hurts! Ernesto, you fool! You animal! Son of Satan! You cannot do this to me again! It hurts! -Friend! -Hello, sis! -[in English] Hello! -Hello! [in English] Thank you! Where's the baby? He's in the nursery. You can check the baby there. -Okay. -I'll just fetch JC outside. -I'll be right back, okay? Bye! -Alright. Friend, how are you? As you can see, I'm good. Hey, you and Lea will be the godmothers of my baby, okay? Our friendship's so worth it. I'm already in debt four times every Christmas! -Why don't you make it five? -[laughs] Oh my God! No way! It's really hard. And I made up my mind. Once I get out of the hospital, I'm leaving Ernesto. Huh? You know, Vi, you're lucky. If I were you, I would enjoy my singlehood. Don't get married. It's hard. You borrowed money from your boss's son? Leading man, you just paid your school fees. I don't want to burden you. [elevator shaft dings] Well, maybe your boss's son can help you, then. Leading man, you are jealous! Even if he's rich, elegant, and smells good, remember, you're still my Sir Chief. And I'm still your Maya. Okay? [in English] Let's go? [in English] Go. -Sister. -Virginia. Mm-mm. Come. Sit down. Yes? [in English] Sister. It's been three months since we've talked. When I told you that I want to be a nun. And you told me that I need discernment. Mm-hm. That's why, within those three months, I waited for a sign. And did you see a sign? Virginia, don't do this to me! Your aunt just influenced you! [Virgie] Mom, Sister doesn't have anything to do with this. Mom, I'm the one who wants this. Here you are again, being dramatic. I've thought about this for a long time, Mom. I prayed for God's guidance. Here you are again. You're calling me "mom". Mom, just let me be. If you want, I will leave Ivan. If that's what you want. Just don't be a nun. [in English] Please. Mom, it will be embarrassing to the Lord. And I already promised Him. [whimpering] [in English] A vocation for… [knocking] -[gentle music plays] -[gasps] You might need this. Mister, do you want coffee? [giggles] Here's your coffee. Here. Thank you. For the coffee now and the last time. That's fine. This is just instant coffee. I like instant better. I can't understand why we should pay more for just a coffee. [sighs] The last time, why were you out in the rain? That's okay. I also do things without any valid reason. One time, I just thought of going out in the rain. Just like you. When I was little, I always remember, me and my friends always played in the rain. We didn't care if we'll be covered in mud. Can I ask for water? Yes, hold on. -I'll just get your water. -Thank you. [sighs] [chuckles] [gentle music playing] [scoffs] Here's your water. Thank you. [sighs] Do you need anything else? Um. What do I have? I have biscuits and bananas. You want? I'm fine with water. Thank you. For the conversation. But you don't talk. It's just me. Sometimes, silence tells more stories. I'll remember that. Wait. Anytime you need someone to talk to, I'm here. I'll listen even if you don't talk at all. On Sunday. At night. Wait! Wait a minute. I'm Virgie. Virginia Dimaculangan. I am Rey. Reynaldo dela Cruz. [dramatic music plays] [Virgie] Rey? Reynaldo? [gasping] Reynaldo dela Cruz? [gasping] -Friend! -Hi, sis! Friend, what can I do? They have the same name. Reynaldo dela Cruz. Believe me! It's like a real-life telenovela! It's amazing! That's why I don't believe it because it's too unrealistic! -Hi, ma'am! -Buy this for your girlfriend. No, thank you. There are many more unbelievable things in real life than in telenovelas. Hmm. -That's right! -You're agreeing again! You're like toy dogs in taxis that don't stop banging their heads. Whatever! You know, maybe it happens in your fairy tale world, but in people's real world, it doesn't happen at all. Guys, just come to my house on Sunday. He'll be there. -Hi. Do you want to try this? -I believe you. But we won't go there. We might disturb you guys. Right? Hi Miss. Try this one. -Try this one. -You two, are you playing games with me? -What will I get if I lie to you? -Why don't they like this? What about your vocation? How about your plans on being a nun? -Suddenly you don't want it anymore? -[man] Thank you. [Virgie] Good morning, Sister! [sister] What? You changed your mind again? It's not like that, Sister. What if that Rey won't show up tomorrow? What will you do? You're going to pursue being a nun again? Sister! You're messing up my mind. Come on, Virgie. You're the one who can't make up her mind. Wait. Is this Rey courting you? [light up-tempo music] [breathes deeply] Did he show any signs that he'll be courting you? Is there any hope that he will court you? Sister, we just saw each other twice. You just met twice and your world's upside down! The reason why I am telling you this is because you are my aunt. And the reason why I'm telling you this is because you are my niece. You know, you must see each other thrice, five times, or even ten times. You must wait for him to court you. [Natasha] He will come today, right? Yes, my friend. I'm changing the curtains here in the house. And I still have so many things to do. -Call me again later. -Bye! Alright. Bye! [upbeat music playing] [phone rings] Oh my. Wait just a sec. -Hello. -[Natasha] Is he there already? [sighs] You're more excited than I am. I told you to come here. I don't want you to get embarrassed when we find out you're just lying. Whatever. No, Lea's right. We'll bother you if we stay there. Wait. What is this all about? You wanted me to be an old maiden before, right? But now you're pushing me to Rey. What do you really want? I don't want to stop your happiness. I don't want you to be like me. You deserve to be happy. [chuckles] -Thank you, my friend! -Anyway, enough of our chitchat. Get ready and he might arrive any moment! Alright. Bye! [sighs] My God, it's six o'clock! He's coming! What else is missing…? [phone rings] [phone continues ringing] -Hello. -[Natasha] Is he there? Come on, Tash, you're more excited than me. It's just nine o'clock. It's just nine o'clock? It's ten o'clock! Your clock is running late! [poignant music playing] [knocking] [Virgie] Just a minute! Who's there? Rey? [in English] Sorry. [sniffles] Rey, what's the matter? Rey. Rey, why are you crying? Why are you crying? Huh? Rey, tell me what's the problem. [sobbing] Rey, what's wrong? Rey. [sobbing] Rey, what's the matter? Tell me. [dramatic music playing] [gasping] [gentle music playing] [in English] Thank you, Lord. [sighs] [Rey] We are braver when we are in love. We brave the sharpness of danger of everything that is in between the streets full of what and why's. Even if there is no answer, we will swim for it, in the vast ocean and the darkness. We will catch the thunder and lightning. We will gather the rain in our palm and offer it to someone dear. Even if we don't know if we have hope, we charge in the battles. Even if we get immobilized in the sadness of love because we love bravely. We love even if we are not loved in return. [indistinct] -Natasha, it's Vi! [giggles] -Vi! Vi, is that you? He came? Mm-hm. Yes, and I'm sure he's coming back. [cheering] Shh… Quiet! -Come, come! -Let's go. -What happened? -It's like this! I didn't know if he was still coming. I was waiting for him and it was getting late. [squeaking] What did you feel? I was so surprised, but I am very happy he came back. [cheering] I have something for you. Wait. Here. -What is this? -Look at it. Thanks for the poem you left for me. It's beautiful. I'm not the one who wrote that. I copied it from a book. I noticed that you are fond of poems. -Why? Have you read my poems? -Yes. [chuckles] I feel embarrassed. [chuckles] They're beautiful, but… Not good enough. When it comes to art, there's no such thing. There's no moral or immoral. I can't understand you. Listen to me. Don't mind me. Huh? With regards to poetry, you don't have to say things that are obvious. If you're happy, you are happy. If you're lonely, you are lonely. Because it's obvious. Use a picture, use imagery. Did my poem tell you that I love you? "We brave the sharpness of danger, will catch thunder and lightning, just like love. You'll do the impossible even if it's frightening." Hey. Hey! Are you listening to me? Uh… [chuckles] You know, I think I understand you more if you're not talking at all. [chuckles] Let's just have coffee. [Lea] JC's graduation is here! [cheering and clapping] Congratulations! -[in English] Congrats, Lea! -I'm so happy for you! -[cheering] -Oh. My Love. [street noises in the background] You've been seeing each other for a while, but until now, you don't know what's keeping him busy? Friend, it's because… Sometimes I can't understand him. You had sex, but you don't even know where he lives, if he's married, if he has ten kids! Wait a minute! What will I do? All I know is that I am happy. She's happy, indeed! [Virgie] We get scared when we fall in love. It's hard to let go of yourself. For tomorrow that is unclear, especially if the present is so bright. It's nothing. We want to be sure of the unsure and to get everything. For there is no shape and face in fear. "It is not seen nor touched. In the end, you'll give way to all the uncertainties. We are afraid because we love. You cannot love without being afraid." -It's beautiful. -What? It's really beautiful. [both giggle] Can I have it? [chuckles] Can I? Rey. Can I… ask you something? What's up, my friend? Hey, Via, is he really coming? No one is taking care of my children. Friend, he told me he is coming. Okay, let's say that he will come, but what if he's just not speaking lines? You told us he doesn't speak much. That is why I'm saying this, right? So, if he comes, you'll be patient with him. -He's shy -Really? Maybe he'll just sit in a corner. It's fine even if he will not say a word. Seeing him is enough. But you know what? -What is it? -I feel like… he's Virgie's "forever"! Oh! This is so romantic! -You know what? -So romantic! [in English] Forever! I feel like you're the only one who believes in forever. -Oh, come on! -[in English] I also believe in forever. See? Fine! The two of you are crazy in love! Whatever! It's disgusting here! I'm leaving! Friend, wait! Let's wait for him for 15 minutes, please? -I don't want to! -Ten minutes? -I'm tired! -He is coming! -Ten minutes, please. Ten minutes! -No! -Hey! -[gasps] [in English] Hello! Rey, you came! Of course! I promised you, right? Hello. I am Rey! -[in English] Hi. -Hello. -Nice to meet you. -Hi. [in English] Hi! Hello! Nice to meet you! -I'll go get you some food. -Go. I have something to tell you guys. I've been wanting to meet you all. Virgie talks about you guys all the time. And it's good that she arranged this, so I can know you all. Oh. You know what? Virgie always talks about you too. -Is that true? -Yes What are you telling them? -Hm. -Nothing much. By the way, do you write poems? No, she's the one who writes poems. And I must say, her poems are making me fall in love. [cheering] With her poems? Yes, with her poems, but of course, with her as well. I believe that a person who can write poetry can love faithfully and passionately. I knew it! There is such a thing as forever! -Forever. -Excuse me, I'll grab some beer. I also believe in forever. Well, not literally because we are humans, we die, we are mortals here, but love, now, that's immortal. Especially when it is true and sincere. Love can fade, but memories will stay, and it will never be gone. [chuckles] [in English] I told you… He is right. -Great! -Great. What do you do, Rey? Me? I'm a teacher. Literature teacher. -But now, I'm on leave -Teacher? Sabbatical? No. I'm just taking a break from work because I believe people should rest, too, to live long, to work, and to love. You didn't tell me that you're a teacher. But you didn't ask me. Natasha, Virgie told me that you have kids. Are they here? How are they? Wait. Juice? Anyone? Juice? -Sure, I'll have one. -Juice, please. -[JC] He's a nice guy. -Hey, I thought he is quiet and shy like he's afraid of people, but why does your boyfriend talk a lot? [Lea] I agree. Friend, I don't know. He might've eaten something. Huh. You're drinking beer? [in English] Cheers. [glasses clanking] [exhales] Sister, why are we here? We can just go to-- Stop. Because you have a big problem, Virginia. Go on. Drink more. Okay. What if you get pregnant? Then all of a sudden he abandons you? Sister, I love him. The question is, does he love you too? You already gave yourself to him. You don't even know where he came from. [scoffs] But he gave himself to me. Who am I to reject him? That's the problem with you and your mother. Ate Corazon is in love with a younger guy while you are in love with whoever that guy is! Why? Is it wrong to be in love? No. But there are many more important things than love. Like what? Like justice, peace, safety of the spirit and the body. I'll just think about love! It would be more difficult for me if I add justice and peace to my problems! -Stop it, sister. -Stubborn child! Cheers! Drink! I brought your favorites. [sighs] Sister is right. I gave myself to a person without any assurance he'll marry me. Fine! I'm sinful! I'm dirty! Disgusting! I'm immoral! Filthy! Worthless! [sobs] My God. That's long. Are you done? [sobbing] Mother. Now, you call me mother. Did you think I came here to scold you? Then what? It's because I miss you. I thought you're going to scold me. Oh no! I like that better than being a nun. I want to have a grandchild. -That's too fast. -Come on! Are you a virgin? Come on! See? I noticed you have such a beautiful house. -[sighs] -It's so clean! The flowers are blooming just like you. I think my baby's in love. [sighs] You know, my child. I came here to see my child happy. Mom. -[sighs] -[chuckles] Child, you have to change your shampoo. Your scalp's smelly! -Mom! -You should be blooming! Hello? Yes. I'll be there! Let's meet at school, my leading man! Bye! -Nice! -I have to go. -Go. You might be late. -Alright. Bye. -Bye, sis! -We'll follow. -Let's go. -Where do you think you're going, Lea Angela Crisostomo? Um… You didn't meet your quota last month. That's why you have to finish this through overtime. Madam, it's her boyfriend's graduation today. [in English] Rules are rules! And you, Virginia Dimaculangan, don't meddle if you don't want me to include you here! -[sighs] -Finish that. Ma'am… That unmerciful fake old albino's getting on my nerves! What about leading man? Just finish it fast. -Oh my. I'm sorry. -We have to go. Just text us, okay? -Mm-hm. -Bye, Lea. -Take care. -Push. [Lea] My poor leading man. I'm sorry. I think I'll just go to your dinner later. I have to work overtime. [JC] It's okay, my leading lady. I'll wait for you. I love you. -Love you too. Bye. -Bye. Hi, Lea. You owe me dinner, right? Since we both have to work overtime, you might want to eat with me? Is that okay? -Where's the taxi? So slow! -[rain drizzling] Miss, can I share? Lea? Do you want to ride with me? There's my car. Um. It's okay, sir. There are taxis anyway. Are you sure? Yes, sir. There should be taxis there. Bye. -Wait! -Wait. Oh. -Sorry. -Are you avoiding me? Um. If that's the case… Lea, I think you know what my intentions are. I love you so much, Lea. -Lea! Wait! -[Lea yelps] What the…? What? -JC! JC! Wait! -This is a misunderstanding! JC! JC! Wait! JC! Wait! Wait! I'll go with you! Wait! -Boss, Guadalupe. -Okay. Sir. JC! Never mind, boss. Wait, JC. It's difficult to get a taxi! Hurry. Get in. -Guadalupe, boss. -Okay. JC! Come on. We're soaking wet! Can we just fix this? Please. Here? -Yes, here. -What about? -You're judgmental. -No, I'm not! You turned your back on me earlier. You expect me to stay? You-- Seeing you with that guy? God, Lea! You were flirting! Hey! If you're just going to fight, just get out. Fools. [sad music playing] Are we fighting? Is there a reason to? None! You're the one who's making an issue! That was not an issue, Lea! What I saw was real. And my love is real. The hurt I'm feeling right now is real. I'm going home. JC! Wait! JC! [JC] Alright, guys, see you. Thank you, boss. I'm off for today, thanks. Can we talk? [sigh] Not now. I will just explain. Not now, please. You don't love me anymore? This is not about love. Can we please not talk about love right now? Wait! Wait! What's your problem? You know what? I left home because my mom was talking to another guy. She kept telling me that he is only a friend. Nothing is going on. Only to find out that he is her lover. And I see you talking to that guy? And you're insisting that he's only a friend. What if he's not? What if there's more going on? I'm not your mother, okay? If you don't want to believe me, then don't. Take care of your life! [sobbing] What am I going to do? He's not answering me. He doesn't want to see me. [sobbing] He doesn't want to see me anymore. [sobbing] Sis! Lea, I heard what happened. It's your fault. The only thing I did wrong is love you. But you knew that I loved someone else, right? [sad music plays] I know. But I really love you. And I just can't hide it. [Virgie] Thank you. -No problem. -[Virgie] JC! Can you sit here? Yeah, sure. I hope you understand this well. Because I don't want my nose to bleed. JC, I only prepared a few English words for this. Huh? Lea resigned. Even before getting fired by madam because of what happened. [in English] You have to understand. Nothing happened between Lea and that Erickson. Lea just slipped because she was excited to see you. Then why didn't she tell me? Because you were overreacting. She told you many times, but you wouldn't believe her. You know what? I came here because my father saw my mother with another man. And because of that, they got divorced. I don't want that to happen to me and Lea. Because I love her. I chose to stay here because of her. I just want to be wherever she is. So what's the problem? JC, don't be afraid. -[soft music playing] -That fear is normal. There's always fear in falling in love. You know what? Because of you and Lea, I believe in love more. I believe that my leading man will come and truly love me. That's why I can't afford to see both of you breaking apart. The people who showed me not to give up on love. On destiny. In a telenovela ending. [Virgie] We are whole when we are in love. After our feelings are torn up. In the continuous ending of relationships that we thought are forever. After the breakup, we are left alone. -I was going to call you. -I was going to call you. Why? What do you mean? Why didn't you call me? I was afraid you wouldn't answer. Why didn't you even try? Because you're afraid? That's also the reason why you resigned, right? No, I resigned because I wanted to find a new job. A better paying job. Now that I've finished school, I want to make money. So I can help you. To help your mom. To support you. Marry you. Huh? [romantic music playing] Will you marry me? [sighs] If you forgive me. For all my doubts. [sobs] For my fear in our relationship. Will you forgive me? Please don't say no. How could I say no? [both chuckles] -[in English] I love you. -I love you too. [Virgie] Just like angels with one wing that cannot fly, even if they struggle to flap away, we are searching for our other half, the one who we could be with, our partner. And when we find them, we will fly away together in the sky because we are already complete. Because we are in love. Faster. I'm going to show you something. -[Virgie] Hello. -[Natasha] Excuse me. Look at Lea and JC. [Virgie] These pictures. I envy their sweetness. But you have Rey. How about you? You're not planning to have a boyfriend? [gags] Over my dead body. I'm so happy to be single and I have my children who make me happy. And that's enough. -Hm. -How about you and Rey? Are you happy? He didn't even show up for days. Not even getting used to it? That's more okay. It's better he disappears than having a mistress. [laughing] Stop, stop, stop. Hold on. Stop it! [laughing] How about you? Here, have it! [gradual music playing] What now? Come here! I said no! [knocking on door] Wait a minute! Who's there? [knocking on door] -Rey? -[rain drizzling] What? How did you get in? Is the gate open? Why were you outside? It's raining. Rey? What's happening to you? Why? -Hey! -[sobbing] [Rey sobs] What happened? [sobbing] Take off your clothes. Take that off! Why are you crying? Rey? Tell me what happened? Huh? Rey. [sighs] Rey, tell me! What now, Rey? Are we going to be always like this? When I wait, you won't come. But when I'm not waiting, you'll come. I'm going to talk, you'll be quiet. I'm going to ask a question, you won't answer. Rey! Tell me. What's the problem? [sobbing] Do you really love me? [dramatic music plays] Rey, don't ask me if I love you if you're not going to say that you love me too. That's why I am asking you. Rey. [emotional music playing] [gasping] -Hurt me. Hit me! -Rey, what's happening to you? Hit me hard. Hit me hard! Harder! Rey! Rey! What's happening to you? You're not being yourself! Just kiss me. Just kiss me! [sensual music playing] [grunts] I got it from a curtain. -I want you to tie it around my neck. -What? -Tie this around my neck. -Rey? -Rey. -Come on, come on. [gasping] -Now, I'm free. I love you so much. -Rey! Virgie, I love you so much. Thank you. Rey! [gasping] Rey? [soft tragic music playing] Rey? Rey! [gasping] Rey! [screaming] Rey! [crying] Rey! [laughing] Oh, wait. Are you okay? -Stand up. -It hurts. Come. Where does it hurt? Here? [both laugh] For a second. [laughter] Rey, why did you choose me? Why did I choose you? Because you are the most beautiful woman in the world. [man] Virginia Dimaculangan, you have a visitor. [gates rattle] -[inmates murmuring] -I think that's it. [woman] Someone's calling you. We'll have more space here. There are just three of us. -[mom] Virgie! -Mom. -Sister. -[Lea] Ate Vi! Virgie, my daughter. [wailing] Mom. [sobbing] I missed you so much, my daughter. -My daughter. -Mom. -Sister. -My goodness. Sister, I am doing fine. How are you fine being imprisoned? I am happy. How can you be happy with this situation? Sister, Rey loves me. Rey loved me. Vi, he is not the real Reynaldo dela Cruz. What? What do you mean? He is not Rey, he is Victor Fernandez. Lea found him. No, he is Rey. Sis, the real Reynaldo dela Cruz sent me a private message. Sis, he's already here! -Mm-hm. -Who is it? The one you are searching for. Come on. Come on. Virgie. -Who are you? -Don't you remember me? I was your former classmate. I am Reynaldo dela Cruz. Yes, I am Rey! What? [playful music playing] I have been looking for you. You were hard to find. But I dream about you every night. And have you forgotten how we played around the field? [sighs] How about our first kiss? -Hm. -Under the tree. First kiss! I told you that time you were the most beautiful woman in the world. That's worldwide, huh. I will never forget that. But since I couldn't find you, I already got a wife. But I'm now a widower! -We can still be together! -Hey! Why? -You are not Rey. -What? Do you want evidence? Here, evidence. This is a picture of us. This is us. I gave you one with my dedication on it. That's me! That's me in the picture! I still have that polo shirt. You are not Rey! Reynaldo dela Cruz is dead. I killed him! He's dead! Read this one, my daughter. What is this? Go on and read. Mother… I wrote this poem for Rey. Yeah, right. It was sent to Pinoy Tattler. Read it for me. I want to hear it. [Virgie] We are complete in love. After feelings are stripped away. In every delay of every relationship is an ironic eternity that ends. We were left like angels with a single wing that can't seem to fly. Even if it tries to soar, it also tries to find its other half to have and to hold. And when our eyes meet, together, we'll fly to the highest of Heavens because we are completely in love. [police] You have a visitor! I am Gloria Fernandez. Victor's mom. I was not able to visit because Victor's dad had a heart attack after he found out what happened to him. But he is not Victor. I know. He is Reynaldo dela Cruz. I saw this inside Victor's journal. He probably saw it, so he owned the name of Reynaldo dela Cruz. My son is sick. Schizophrenia. He was confined in and out of the hospital. That's why he was not able to come with us to the U.S. I didn't know about it. Don't worry. I am not blaming you for my son's death. Victor's journal. [gasping] He loved me, didn't he? He truly loved me, didn't he? Victor has loved so many girls. [sobbing] But there was none who loved him because of his sickness. You were the only one. You made him happy in the last moments of his life. That's why I am so grateful to you. -But I killed him. -No. You didn't kill him. Since he was a child, Victor already had a hole in his heart. And that is the cause of his death according to the medico-legal. Not strangulation. Don't worry. I am sure Victor does not want you to stay here forever. [in English] I will testify to save you. And we will take care of your baby. Thanks a lot. [in English] Wherefore, for failure of the prosecution to establish evidence for the crime of murder, the court hereby finds Virginia Dimaculangan Y. Miranda not guilty of the crime of murder, so ordered. [banging] Mom! [sobbing] Thank you. -[in English] Sister! -Congratulations! Very good. Vi! Vi! -[laughing] -Thank you. -Sis! -Lea. Good thing you can come to the wedding! Sis! [in English] Thank you! -Virgie! -What the hell? [cheerful music playing] Why? This is me, Rey dela Cruz. What do you mean? I told you you were dead. [light up-tempo music playing] Thank you. If you loved me or not. But I assure you, I did love you. -Virgie. -Huh? What are you doing here? Following you. Are you a stalker? -No, I love you so much. -Can't you see? I'm already pregnant. I accept it. I'll take care of you. You know what? If you don't stop, I will hit you. [grunting] -Wait. What happened? -Just please stop. -Wait up. Wait up! -Mom! -I told you to leave. Leave! -I'll bring you to the hospital. I'm so handsome! You're lucky to have me! -Mom! -Wait! Mom, I'm giving birth! -What are you doing to my child? -You even fantasized about me before. Mom! -[mom] Stop doing that to her! -Mom! [indistinct chatter] -Mom, please help me. -I'm here now. -Mom, please. -I'm here. [gentle music playing]
