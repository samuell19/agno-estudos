No more communism! Wow! That's not a bas-relief. That's another technique… How do they call it, man? It's a special technique. A fancy artistry, anyway. Stop scratching! You'll break down the wall. Built in '25, by the Russi family, French origins. Oh, the Russi family. Established in Bucharest around 1800… the architect: Petre Antonescu. Are you crazy, man! You know who this guy is? -Well? -He's a super big balls dude. He did the Arch of Triumph. Among other things -Did he? -Yeah, he did. And the engineer's name is… Armand Lazaride. So funny! -Related to Lazaride you think? -The old guy downstairs? -Right. -Who knows? -Sgraffito! -What? That's how they call it. The technique. But who's the young lady here? Pics, pics… Pics, pics… can't find any photo of them. She's probably a relative, or some friend. Why would she be on the walls, otherwise? Not necessarily. These houses hide stories that make your hair stand on end. My hair doesn't stand on end. I know, babe. You feel fascinated. Well, yeah… OK. Great. Bye, Radu. Eat your food. Your dad is late. Cosminel? Cosminel, are you listening? Put the phone away and finish your food. Please. C'mon. Put that thing away! Stressed again, boss? Would you like me to make the stress go away? Better now?

All right, but a short one. The Jonah story. That's not short. You can split it into episodes, right? Right. But you got to promise me you'll go to sleep after that, OK? -OK. -So… Once upon a time, there lived a man whose name was Jonah. And, one day, God ordered him to go to a big city, where-- Why was he called Jonah? Well, we have discussed that already, haven't we? We had a common consent about it. What's a "common consent"? A common consent is when two people agree to-- Sorry. Yeah… I'll be right with you. Yes. Good morning, Mr. Lazaride! How are you today? I'm all right, thanks. -You got the magazines, right? -Yeah, I did. Keep myself in the loop, what can I say. Tell me, Mr Marinescu, what's all about this trial? Another subpoena. Here, I just got it. What am I supposed to do? Give it to Attorney Stoianov? Of course. You don't need to worry. Well, I don't. Except I do. I've spent months in the Archives for that research. Yeah, right. You should have been given a quicker access there. After all, it was your father who devised the blueprints, wasn't he? My father?! He didn't devise anything. He was an engineer. He just built this house. It's… it's just I'm never told much, you know. Please do not worry. I'm telling you, we shall win this case. Stop all the Archives actions; don't bother anymore, it's Marius who takes care of everything. He's an outstanding lawyer and my best friend, too. Besides, this new guy who claims to be the legal successor he's actually a fraud. Yes, right. Too many frauds in this country. By far too many. And too much incompetence, either. I'm scared, you see. If some big shot out there targeted this house, then it's already his. Everything is possible today. Especially here. In Romania. Hello… No need to worry, it's not that bad. Told you, we can pull some strings, too. Consider it done. Good morning. Catch up later. -Hi, Matei. -Hi. You got the German stuff? Yeah, I got them all. I'll borrow them tonight, when I come over and install the Wi-Fi device for you. I'll give you our password too, and you'll have internet. For free! -Really? -It's a bonus. Mister Marinescu! -May we pay the rent on 15th this month? -Sorry? I say, may we pay the rent on 15th this month? It's my first pay day at this company I work for. No problem, guys. Whenever you can. -Okay? -Okay. Good morning, Lilisor. Hugs to you, Mr Voicu. How's it going, fine all right? Fine! You know, I do the guys upstairs today, but I can come and do you too, after that, if I still can. Well, no rush. If it's not today, it will be some other time… Let me see how it goes. Gotta work now. Well, good luck, Lilisor. And good it is! Take care, sir. Morning! Have a look! Everything fresh! A carp to souse. STOP THEM! STOP THEM! How's Stela? Sorry. She's fine. And Cosminel? He's okay. Like a cat on hot bricks. He's got a personality! This place, it looks like… something! Yeah, a nice spot to make your day in the morning. Good for your vigour, you know. I do. What I don't know is why you refused to meet me in my office. Here, your property file, for the apartment above. Everything is in there: the contract, the cadastre, the registration, all the papers. It's all yours. Enjoy it! Marius… you're so damn cool! You owe me one! I owe you several. You won over the Government. If you win over these losers who claim to be the legal heirs… Look, the house is not under Law 112. It has not been nationalized. The former owners flew to France in the mid-thirties and nobody could ever find them. On the 10th of March 1950, a Court Order was issued and the little house became an asset of the State Patrimony. Bye-bye! Speaking of which. You gotta call Lazaride. He was sent another subpoena. He's been pretty lemons lately, the old fart. No worry, we'll add him some sugar. This trial is a joke. Do not bother. You'd better focus on the highway project. Four days till the deadline. Let's party, man. We gotta win this auction, it's EU money, dude. -Real money, pal. -Yeah, man, I know. I work like a dog. I'd been fighting with Stela too. Coz I'm fucking serious about this. About Stela? About the auction. I work 14 hours a day, fuck me! I served you the files of the competitors. So do the damn project and do it well. Do it perfect, Radu; perfect! -Time is money, huh? -Right. And… Thanks again. Send my regards to Stela. Yeah. Yes, honey, I'm done here. I'll indulge myself in the world of Eros. Till noon. Yes, I'm already there. Yes. I'll be waiting for you "in 23". Two-three, babe! Two-three. What the fuck! Hello? Wow, gosh! What a surprise! Yeah, I started working all right. What are you talking about!? No private cabinet, I'm the slave of the Government. Nope, it's a school for kids with special needs. My man won't allow anybody to take him away from his fatherland-and-sky. Right. Yeah… No, sis, he says we gotta solve our problems wherever they come up, not to run away from them to Miami. Hello? Guess who just called me! Mara. -From the States? -Yeah, from the States. She wanna know when we go and pay them a visit. Coz they apparently-- Wait a sec, the other one's ringing. Hold on. Hello? Hi, mom. Yeah, give me a sec, I'm on the other phone with Matei. So, she asks about our plans to visit them, what'd you say? No, mom, not you. Matei, do you hear me? We talk about it when I get home. It's bustling here. See what your mom wants and be careful with your crazy nuts. Hey, don't call them like that. Tell me, did you find any pics? -What pics? -Russi family pics. Nope, but I've got some news. Armand is indeed Voicu's father. Voicu Lazaride's? Who else. The old guy was a big cat at the moment. When the communists came, they put him in prison, coz he was kind of an aristocrat or so. Then they exonerated him, since he was needed, professionally. But the hottest thing is that he also lived in that house. Between 1960 and 1978, when he died. Of course, he lived there together with his own son. Our Mr. Voicu. Gee. A huge telenovela. Yes, pumpkin, we talk later. I'm pretty busy now. I bark you very much. Woof, woof. Woof. Yes, mom? Funny-bunny, put those fucking little gig jobs away immediately. I don't pay you for this. Sorry, Mr. Vladescu, but I have nothing for the company right now. Nothing for the company right now? I'm waiting for the Mall surveying. You are killing me with your small profits little jobs. And don't fuck around with me about the Mall. Tell me. Oprescu, his villa in Otopeni, did you finish the drawings? They are ready, yeah. Good. I want them. And stop fucking with me, boss. I don't like it. Oh, we are playing sensitive now. Well, let's assign you a sensitivity trophy then, what'd you say? Of course, by the vote of your colleagues. I'm happy if you assign me some respect, that's all. That makes two of us. And let me refresh your memory. We had a deal when I came here: work is work when I have to work The drawings! But when I have nothing to work, I do my thing. Take some pills, boss, if you're losing it. What did you just say? Sorry, I … What did you say? I have to take this. May I? See you in my office. You too! Both of you. May I? Yes, Mr. Marinescu -You talk later! -Yes, it's almost ready. -I said 'Now'! -Guess I'll deliver it in a few days. Yeah, I work now and then, you know how it goes when you're just an employee. I mean, you don't. Dude, Vladescu is waiting for you in his little office. Again. He's freaking out, you have humiliated him. Let him kiss my ass…. Yes, will do… You'll probably have them on Friday night. Sorry, I gotta take this call… Hello? Hello? Mr. Marinescu? -Yeah, I'm listening. -Roman calling, from Giurgiu. You said we'd discuss about the warehouse from-- Call my office and talk to my secretary and I shall call you back, OK? Well, you said that today we were-- Have a good one. Sorry, Zimniceanu, it's been a crazy day here. Please, feed me! Chill out! We'll figure it out. I'll get some precise intel about the figures. My mother-in-law has a niece who's dating a young economist at their firm. She'll pump some info out of him, I'll make sure of that. You're good, Sandu! Keep in touch! Call you soon! Cheers! Cheers, mate…. -Nedelcu! -Hello? Tony, dear, am I interrupting something? Nothing important. A business brunch. I apologize, I won't be long. Tell me, man, who's behind the BELLA CASSA deal? The Party? Coz I have this feeling they have huge connections for the auction, and I'd go under the price, to cut them off, coz the rest of the participants are just extras. Well… Radu, dear, they're kind of remotely "related" to the big boss. The supreme boss? That's right, baby. Then it sucks. We really have some competition there. Well, yeah, but they still have some weak points, don't worry. How much to find them out? Well, not too much, dear; just an underground extension at my house in Corbeanca. Easy-peasy. Will do. When can I take you out for a soda? Whenever you like. Call me tomorrow and we arrange that. Have a lovely day. Deal. Have a great one, too… Yes, hello? Hello? Yes, speak, please. Hello? Good morning. Good morning. Please, speak. I'm listening. Mister Marinescu? Speaking! Mister Marinescu, it's me, Vasile Turcu from Arad. Can you hear me? Hello? I can hear you perfectly well. And I'm in a hurry here, so please talk. Well, Mister Marinescu. They say they won't rebuild the House of Culture anymore, coz they say they leave it as it is, a historical document, or monument, or something. Anyways, it's not my business, but the issue here it's that we cannot-- Fine. Perfect. Call my office and talk to Mimi, my secretary, -I'll call you back, OK? -Now then-- -Gotta go now-- -Hello? Jimmy, man, sorry, it's been insane here. Look, I've got something to ask you: can you subscribe your company for this EU highway auction? I mean, just for fun, I don't need you to win, just to participate, you see? Participate. I see. So we can have our own competitors. Got it, Mister Radu. It's clear. We have this. Yeah? Will you help me? How could I not help you, sir? What world would that be? We are all human beings, Mister Radu. Let me see… I'll call on your office and we set all the details. -Is this all right? -Excellent. One p.m. tomorrow suits you? Deal. Everything good? How's going on? Fine, just fine. Excuse me, I have a call on hold. Yes, Mimi, what's up? Boss, I'm sorry, but I'm at the end of my patience. It's like a call centre here. Don't know what to tell them. When do you get to the office? At 12:30 as usual, Mimi. Really?! And what am I supposed to do? You're a big girl, deal with it. But, boss, there's a guy from Arad who keeps calling me-- Bye-bye, Mimi. You'll get your money tomorrow. Remember, my old account has been blocked. I'll text you the new one. See you. Bye. See you… Stela. Home. You have called the Marinescu residence. Please leave your message. Voicu Lazaride speaking. So you believe my presence is not necessary in court? I'm gonna catch you! Shall we know a bit more after this court date? You are listening Musical Kaleidoscope Show. Sorry? Oh, tell me about it! They have nothing to do with the real owners. Well, I guess I'll be in Court on the fifth, though. That should be fine, right? Have a nice day. If I were to change a thing In my entire life I'd sell everything out and buy some time Cold drizzle in the East And I'm somehow heading West I'd just stop and go back But I'm walking on the tail of the tiger If there's something to be changed Anything to be changed I'd sell out and buy some time I'd sell out and buy some time Stop them! I'd just stop and go back But I'm walking on the tail of the tiger Anything wrong, kitty? All good, why? C'mon, kitty, don't be cynical! I've been trying to reach you since this morning. Maybe I don't want to be reached. Kitty! I found a gorgeous place. What's going on? Nothing. I've got some news for you. Some beautiful news. A romantic dinner, kitty. I take you out tonight. Oh, yeah? Where? Surprise! You'll love it. It's a refined and sophisticated spot. We'll have something special tonight! -You don't say! -Just ask Lili to babysit for Cosminel. -You think she'll be fine with that? -See you. Bye. Here's the surprise! Thank you! But… What about Mirelutza? Did she call yet? You don't call from Australia every day. It's expensive. Just saying. We've been received those invitations; you know… I guess they're like 11 or so… and what do we do? Reli, love, shall we go? Where, love? In Australia? Well? She'd rather come here, I'd say. Well, yes, that's pretty much so. They're younger, it's easier for them. Besides, we still have this issue with the house… Right. Stay where you are! Then I bet the apartment's number multiplied with the age of Matei and divided by 2, and then I bet those… figures; our phone numbers. Got it! I bet my social security number and the passcode on Voicu's pension voucher. Yeah! And, of course, the number of the house, as always. Right. I always bet this number, either. Coz I don't know, there's something… almost magic about this house. I mean, it's our "honey moon house", but I also have so many feelings about this place. Positive feelings, I mean. You know? Yeah, Let's hope it's a winner. The number, I mean. Oh. Right. Yes. Let's see now. So, dear, look, you're gonna take a long trip, with a surprise at the end, in a few points later. Meaning: very soon. Very soon! This house… I feel it's… dunno… it's trying to connect with me. I don't believe in paranormal. Come on. Well, but--? What? This? Oh, no. That's different. This is science. Oh, I get it. Guess next time I'll bet my social security number too… And I could also bet … What? Nothing. Just a thrill. You were so young, Mr Lazaride! I was. You know, I never knew it was your father who'd built this house. And how did you find out? The internet rules! Saint Google. He knows everything. Better than the Mossad! Speaking of which, what about the Russies? -The Russies! -The Russies… -What about the owners? Their whereabouts? -Nothing. Nobody knows anything. I tried to find them; my father also tried to find them and nothing. I guess they didn't want to be reached anymore. Right. They are not to be found on Google either, which is pretty odd. Whatever, it'd be cool to get in touch with them. You could have asked for some help with the trial. From whom? Maybe from their scions… if they had any descendants. Since they haven't shown up so far, I presume this house is of no longer interest for them. No, Matei. This is a lost cause. Trust me, we don't need to bother. I thought that, had they come and help you… Stop them! …I dunno, all this shitty show was over. The false successors, the fake identities… All this nonsense! It's useless. Trust me. Jeez. You were so young! What do you say? It's all right. So? You said you had shocking news. Shoot! Shock me. Sit tight: The apartment above… It's ours. I got the papers. All has been settled. I saw Marius today. By the way, he says hi. Thanks. What shall I bring you? Madam? As usual? We haven't decided yet. Of course, I'll come back later. He is taking me for someone else, isn't that obvious? So, you bought the apartment above. Good job. Perfect. Congrats. What can I say. The entire house is ours. Well, minus the apartment of the old ones. Why don't you buy them too? I'll allow them a little bit longer. Are you serious? Don't mention it. I have an awesome plan for that apartment. Just a tiny deal, an auction to win and I'll give you the surprise of your life. My good fairy! I understand your cynicism, but it's for the best, I promise. Kitty, you'll be so proud of me. You're the one, kitty! Have you decided yet? As always. Thank you. My girls, I can't do it. Shop online. Fast delivery, in 48 hours. Take advantage of the discount week.

They're vulnerable? Don't kill me, a huge company like that? And they registered for the auction? Well… bad luck for them. Shoot, man! C'mon Alexander, knock me out. Amaze me. Drop the bomb! What's the deal? We build the highway, or what? What about Mihaileanu? Is he gonna beat us down with his offer? What? No way! My deepest respect, Mister Geor-- Yeah, sure. No names over the phone, of course. Sorry? Obviously, the intel was useful, more than useful. Essential. Without it… Yes… I never owe things to people, you know me. A pool! Right. A jet, sure, senator. It's the fanciest trend now, a pool with a jet. They all go for the jet abroad these days. Of course. At the pool.Right. Yes. On the terrace, where else! Great. Have a nice day! Have a nice one! Marius, my man, we're gonna kick their asses. The file is damn cool. We tear them apart! We totally fuck them! Funny-bunny, what you doing? Private little projects again? In my firm? You are right. I apologize, Mr Vladescu. But wouldn't you please suck my dick, Mr Vladescu, so I can feel I don't work for peanuts here? In my office! Both of you! Apparently, Vladescu got himself a huge contract again. Systematization and urbanism right here, in the heart of the city. Lots of money, a real smakeroo. Delivered by some local big shots and financed by some EU bigwigs. We shall work our asses out again. And after that, he takes the credit. Silviu, my darling, don't take it personally, but the commission declared themselves quite unsatisfied with you at their last meeting. I mean, deeply unsatisfied, if you know what I mean. Don't darling me. And no, honestly, I don't know what you mean. Why are they deeply unsatisfied? Don't play the innocent here. Your last reports were a mess. -How come? -A complete mess. You have removed yourself from the protocols dossier investigation… -Come on! I have… -And now, what? You cover this weirdo's ass? Marinescu's ass!? Wait a second, what do you mean? How do I cover his ass? You believe we are asleep, or what? You think that the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing? That we have a poor communication between our departments? Wrong. Everybody knows everything. Look at your face, as if you weren't one of us. Man, you're killing me. What's the problem? What are you trying to tell me, actually? Tell me! How's the firm going? Darling. What on earth are you doing? Let me see… Online research. Cut if off! It's urgent. What?! Yeah. Right. Look here! You gotta access this we.we.we.we address… that's correct… so I can sign in for a tombola where I'll win 100.000 lei. -The new currency! Do you hear me? -Nope. Take your tombola and get out. I ordered a stepper, so they gave me a ticket number, so I have to register that number there, on that address, on the internet, here, I'm showing it to you! So I can then sign in for the tombola and then they give us 100.000 lei. You see? You're crazy. You ordered a stepper. For whom? It doesn't matter. For you, OK? Now, please, can you type this address for me? Pretty please! You have completely lost it. You're the pure victim of TV manipulation. Nobody manipulates me! You should learn how to be generous! -You should learn how to be reasonable. -Really? I am being reasonable. I believe in destiny. You-- what do you believe in? Google? In all the… Give it to me!

I don't need it anymore. But don't be upset. Make a phone call to the TV show, maybe this time… You go play with your beloved internet. I'll never call anybody, anyway! Right, we don't have a router anymore. What'd you say? I said there was no pressure. Lili, what's up? I'm-- What are you doing, kitty? Nothing! You are doing nothing! Nothing! Nothing! I'd like to do it here. Like… now? Like… the house. I see… It's gonna be perfect. I'll give it a vintage look, like old brick. Why not a trendy brick? So you grab my dick! C'mon. I'm serious. I'm obsessed with this stuff. Do you realize? The architectural patrimony of Bucharest has been fucked up by Ceausescu. These houses are true encounters. They keep the mark of real artists. And the mark of time. They're artefacts. You know? I want two hamsters. What?! I don't give a shit about this auction! Okay? I couldn't care less! I need a… a goal, something. You are never satisfied. -Ever never. It is not enough. -What's not enough? What? Spit it out. The goal. Nothing is enough for you. Nothing's good enough for you. Let me teach you how to drive. Listen, kitty! -Here you are! -You have no right to blame me. I have abandoned my career, my job. Do you realize where I'd have been now in advertising if hadn't I given it up? It was your call! You could have come back one year later, but you chose not to. That's so sweet, you giving me this shit now, after 15 years… It's wonderful. It's perfect. I can't thank you enough. I'm so sick with your attitude. You're always so… -What? -So cynical. Can we have a normal conversation here? -Why are you shouting? - No! -I am not! -Yes, you are. You're shouting. Can't you just be… cynical, too? -No, you cannot. You need some-- -Brain, right! Yeah, kitty! OK, it doesn't bother me that you call me stupid, but why the fuck can't you accept that you've always had it your way. The way you liked it. Stop mentioning that. Just stop bringing this on! I have "liked" things for the good of our family. -Have you!? -I have! This is not my perception of things. -You're an asshole. -Why? For speaking out the truth that bothers? It's you being a dick that bothers! Look who's shouting now! You're all fads, claims and whims! Nothing else in your little brains there. Great. You know what? Stop showing off in front of me! That's what you've been doing your whole life. C'mon. Speak up your mind! If you have something to say, say it now! A mental map for the garden… -Hey! -Yeah? When we move out, I'd like us to keep this studio. This one? -Why? -I wanna open my own office here. Here? Why? I wanna start my own business, as a therapist. You don't have another option in Romania, right? It's not like you had more options before, sure thing. But, at least it's worth it a try. One more dream. Why not? And besides… there's something about this house I can hear it calling for me. This artefact is special. You know what I mean? Nope. Maybe I used to live here in a previous life. Yes, the ship. So, Jonah got on the ship and sailed away, on the sea. Why? In order to run, to escape. But a big storm broke out and sank the ship. And the ship, with all men aboard, went to the bottom of the sea. And then, a huge whale came and swallowed the ship. Once in the belly of the whale, the people started a big fire, in order to escape from there… Dad, that's Pinocchio! What? That's Pinocchio. Really? Sorry. Give me a minute. Hello, nice to hear you, sir. Good evening. I'm glad you could make it. -Happy to see you again. -Me too. Amazing! Respect. Sorry, I stepped on your foot. It's all right. -It's okay. -You look awesome. Thank you. You too. Take it easy, don't be nervous. Calm. Dear guests, we're living a huge moment. We are writing history here and now. This highway, that will be over 250 km long, will be inaugurated in two years from now, when we have the Presidency of the EU Council. He's so great. He's so cool. Watch the breaking news tonight! It was very difficult, but in 2019 we'll have a bridge of flowers to the heart of Europe. If it wasn't for me, his bridge of flowers would go down the drain! Thank you. Shoot some ambiance. I'm going to prepare the interview. You know what I long for? Yeah, you do… Precisely. You have been struggling to build your roads in the past few decades, and, unfortunately, you also did it one foot at a time. Room two-three. Yeah? Yes, my little crazy monkey. Fast-forward. Deal. Kiss you. You, animal! But it means a giant step forward. And what's there, right in front of us? There is Europe. One more thing, though. I have to mention the fact that we have eradicated… all the moles on our highways. And one more thing. It's an honour to have me among you… Told ya it was gonna be great? Stop being stressed! Relax, man! You are good, dude. You are damn good. If you also win the property case for me… Here we go! Chill out. Will do. Told you already. And I'll give you something else, a super-deal. A surprise. I'll let you know when the time is right. Hope you won't be too shocked, though. It's gonna be OK, man. But for those pure at heart, they will receive the power of making. Blessed be this construction work, a work that will bring honest money to all those who weary for it, and to all those who benefit from it… -Blessed be… -Zoom on the priest! What? Close up with the priest! Such penetrating eyes! You wanna screw him, too? Blessed be the day labourers, bosses and their friends, who have generously contributed to this construction and all those who humbly and modestly… Sorry! Nice reception! -Yeah, thanks. -By the book. -Yes? -Kitty, what you doing? -Sorry, it's my wife. -Sure. Nothing. Good job. I've got a hot piece of news, babe. We gotta talk. See you in one hour? Don't think so. I have drama-therapy today. -When do you finish? -Dunno. It depends. Cool. Then, see you later? Okay. Amen! I have to take this. It's Flaviu. Really? Yeah… Hold on, dude, take it easy. I'm not at the office. What's up? Where are you? Like… now? All right, got it. And we place the logo here. Large! A neon logo! Yellow! Grey and yellow! Perfect. Grey and yellow! It will look so cool, imagine that! And I'll be your first client. To bring you luck. Kitty… What'd you say-- Do they still remember me after 10 years? -The advertising people. -Fuck them all, it doesn't matter. I'll give you all my clients. And partners, too. And my subcontractors either … if only you could manage your time! And I'll bring you Sirbu for the outdoors. He owns half of the country. You just need to be patient. Told ya everything was gonna be fine in the end. God's will and everything goes out fine, right? God's will and you'll have your name written on the biggest banner in town! Sky is the limit! I love you! Yes. I'm so happy, my dear. Right, I got the job. Five grand. Excellent. But tell me, mom, when do you come here? What's pa thinking? Well, Mirelutza, we still have some issues to deal with. What? Is the Securitate still listening to your phones, or what? Oh, come on! They are not. It's just an old phone, that's all. So, what issues were you talking about? The trial. But we'll come visit, dear; we'll come. Later on. -Yup. -Maybe you could come here instead? Look, pa's here. Wanna talk to him? Here's Mirelutza. Go on, talk to her! -Hello? -Talk! It's all right. Good bye, dear. Good bye. Someone just came in. A friend of her husband's. We just spoke to her. Yeah. Stop them! STOP THEM! Do you have it? Give it to me. -What's on it? -I'll tell you. C'mon, give it to me, they're waiting. It's a huge deal, fuck me if not! What am I, man, your delivery boy? -Tell me what's all this shit about. -It's about a huge bargain. It's the shit I already mentioned to you. Get ready, you, slave! We'll sleep at the office. Gotta get in; see you! MILENNIUM GRUP BUILDS 250 KM OF HIGHWAY IN ROMANIA MILENNIUM GRUP BUILDS 250 KM OF HIGHWAY IN ROMANIA I could have bet my ass on this triumph. We'll have the papers signed in one week. That's a super client! Pretty peculiar this client of yours. So what? What does it matter, as long as he pays? I'm not gonna ask for his hand, am I now! The execution of the project is my call. Relax, the guy is one of ours; he's already in, but he doesn't know it yet. Well, we do! -Sorry to interrupt. -Please do. I believe we have to be very careful with the certificates. The EU laws, boss. The EU laws, you say… The EU laws, you say… A very careful generation. Very cautious. Very scrupulous I'd say. A fucked up generation. Listen to me, young lady! It's me who make the law here, and who don't like it, is free to goes home! It's a crime what you do to these kids! A crime! You won't help them in any way, and more than that, you won't let me help them, either! You know what? You are fired, miss! I'll quit, too! I won't be part of this mockery! -But you'll see yourself on the news. -No kidding! What you figure you'll get out of this? Change the world? -Yeah! Maybe I will. -Give it a try, girl! And text me when you done! I will! But you should take some psychological counselling until then. I do believe you need help; I can offer it to you if you want. Whatever, who don't like it, is free to says ‘no'. Don't be insolent! Fucking hashtag nerd! Take it to the first room there, I said. You too, move! Lili? This thing doesn't work. Hey, guys, who's the electrician here? Come on, do your best! Ma'am, try it now. Does it work? -Perfect! -Good. You, take this. Good job. C'mon! Touching the Star Agency. Stela Marinescu speaking. How can I help you? When? When? Today? Can't make it today. Gotta be here, I mean it. We decorate the space. Tomorrow? Nope, I guess we won't finish soon. The day after tomorrow? I really don't know. I'll call you when I'm done. OK? What about me? Longing and sad… You know how much it hurts. Come on, just cut this bullshit, please. Gotta go now, I'm busy. Talk to you later. This sucks, you know! Since he is the boss, no matter he's an imbecile, you can't do anything about it. Told him a million times, Flaviu and I, we both did, and he's not an idiot! I mean Flaviu-- We both tried to explain to the moron: this house will collapse if we build it like this. The client doesn't know. He's a stupid red neck, he's not supposed to know. But us?! Are we a serious company, or what? I don't give a shit he pays lots of money for it. No, man, it's pointless! I've told you about Alexandra, haven't I? The little girl who doesn't speak. But the fact is she wasn't born dumb. -You know? -Right. Besides, I just refuse to make a project that I know it's monkey business. Well, at least, that's what I got from the smattering of papers I had access to. No birth certificate, no nothing; ludicrous diagnostics… That woman manager, oh my God! She won't communicate a damn thing. Not to mention all the frustrations I have now, coz I'd been dreaming about a real assignment; like… this house, for instance-- true quality, man, not just kitschy pompous claims. And let him remember, the fucking moron, that he didn't pick me from the ditch when he hired me! -What do you mean? -I mean I was on the rise. I was riding high after that prize I'd win and that big construction built after my blueprints I could have been offered super deals! But he promised me time; he said he'd gi' me time and he gave me a fucking shit. You know what? Fuck him! I quit. I'll just quit. Man, just don't be jumpy. I can't take it anymore, man! -Know what? -What? That little girl I was telling you about, Alexandra. She sticks to me every day. Give me a break with your crazy nuts, will you? -I was trying to talk to you. May I? -Not now. I'm not in the mood for that silly shit. It's not some silly shit. I'm seriously thinking about quitting this job. Do you care? Not for the moment; no. I have enough on my plate now. You always have enough on your plate! Or you're not in the mood. Or you just don't feel like listening to me. It's me who always has to listen to you. It's all about your boss and your damn projects! About how to build the little pool for some bloody senator, or how to build the little staircase for a fucking representative! All you care about. Every day, the same old shit. You know what? Fuck their houses, too! I can never talk to you! But I have to pay attention to all your shit. That's it. -You start being Marinescu! -Can you just stop this? I'm a real mess. They fucked up my brains, isn't it obvious for you? Wow, maybe I'm a mess, too. A bigger mess! Good. You want a competition? Who's the biggest mess, or what? No, I just want a little bit of attention. Too much for you? -I have always paid attention to you! -Sure you have! Yeah, between the time you spend at the job and the time you're online at home, you find the time to ask: "What's for dinner"! You do exaggerate now. -You're rambling. -You know what your problem is? You're not even aware of yourself. Thank you. What can I say? You're pissing me off, man. No, you are pissing me off. Systematically. Do you have a schedule for that, or what? You're being paranoid! I have no schedule for anything. You don't. But you're good at it…. You're so good. This… goes here… This one doesn't… This one? It does. "I wish you a career to the height of your professionalism." "My beloved Armand… Best wishes, Basil Russi. Armand Lazaride." Where are you? Gotcha! Of course… Predictable. What are you hiding here, you, nasty worm? Very clever, indeed. What a super deal, man. It's a huge building complex here. So, guys, where do you fling it? Fuck me! This is where I live. What are you doing here, funny-bunny? Extra time? Working late? You know I can't pay you for that. What are you up to, huh? So intense! Oops. -I just wanted to catch up. -To catch up? There's a spreading secrecy disease here. Well, save your energy, bunny. I'll tell you what's all about, reliable, important intel; You're free to go. Dismissed. -I don't believe that… -That you've been dismissed? Trust me, you have. Get your stuff and get out. For good. Let's calm down, sir. Who's freaking out here? Look, I'm telling you very calmly: get your shit and go home. What do you think you're doing? You stick your nose in my underwear? Really!? OK, dude. Glad we agree on that. Fuck you company, you, thug! Jeez, you make me laugh. All right. Listen, mother fucker, I knew you were dealing dirty shit here, but I didn't think you were such an asshole. Destroying a helluva patrimony building, you, moron! Don't start crying now; be a man. I got it. Come on, get lost! Doctor of Urbanism, my ass! Who the fuck you thing you are, people? Where do you wanna take this society? Ouch. Walking ungratefulness! I picked you from the streets, boy, and gave you a meaning. And you? What you doing? Peeping? Rummage through my laundry basket? You, dick head! Dick head? You knew I wasn't a nobody when you fooled me to come work for you; you made me believe I was given the big deal, but you actually screwed me! I am totally astonished here. I wouldn't believe you are capable of such thing. Didn't expect you to have such a verbiage. Honestly. I was told by your colleagues that you were a true wild beast, though. Come on now, Slumdog Holmes, fuck off. Show me your walking back. You'd give us emotional speeches in class, about preserving the monuments. Aren't you sick now with so much shit you've eaten? Come on, man! -Professor? -What? Shop Online presents ErgoRide, a specially designed device… This stays here. …who want to maintain their mobility, tone and… …daily exercises… STOP THEM!

EU money again. Meaning safe money. And private, too. Wait, this is in my district. And look, that's my house! And here-- there's no house. Man, have you lost your minds? You plan to demolish my house? I don't get it, what's this shit about? Whose mess is this? Who's behind this filth? The trial is tomorrow. What's happening in court, tomorrow? Tell me! You lost the trial. What do you mean I lost the trial? You just lost it. It's my house. The whole building is mine. I mean, almost! I'm the owner. The owner, do you hear me? Whose side are you on, anyway? What kind of blowout is this, Marius? At whose expense, though? -Man, relax, please. -Don't tell me to relax. I warned you about being shocked, didn't I? Now, calm down. Let's talk some sense here. They're demolishing my house and you want me to talk some sense! Are you fucking crazy, or what? No, it's not them who'll demolish the house; it is you. You will bring it down. Millenium Construct, namely. And after that, you build up the great building complex. On the same spot. Are you fucking with me? Sit down, relax. Have a look over this. The entire project is there. Sleep over it, talk to Stela. We sign the contract on Tuesday. Man, that house costed me a fortune! Calm down, you'll have your money back. The Government will pay you. Not the whole amount, but it's still worth it. But Marius, that's my house. It's my house, man. It's my beloved project. -It's my life. -Yeah, man, I know, but you can make ten other houses with the money you'll earn from this work. Ten houses! Do you hear me? Ten. When did you find out? Why didn't you tell me? You think it was easy for me to impose on them this Millenium Construct of yours? Stop them! Hello. Toni Russi. Beep. Message, please. Good evening, my name is Voicu Lazaride, I'm the son of Armand Lazaride, the engineer who built your house; your family's house, in Bucharest. We are in a desperate situation here; the building has been abusively taken by local mobsters and they plan to bring it down. After the communist disaster had ended, I hoped that things would come back to normal; that the common sense would prevent other disasters and abuses from happening. But here we are now? What's she doing? A complete mess… I won a sandwich maker! I believe you are the only one who could still do something. Maxim, at your age, haven't you heard that size doesn't matter? Did the phone ring? Ladies and gentlemen, for security reasons, we'll be asking not to leave your luggage unattended or to other persons. Thank you for your understanding. How are you? Australia? Yeah, well… Mirelutza did insist on that… And then… there's no place left for us to go, here. Right. We've left our furniture to the friend's houses, to some… To some other friends'. It's pretty hard to squeeze a three-bedrooms apartment in 10 square meters. And a tiny little kitchen, this big! He's right. What about you? America. To our godparents. Yeah, he's got a scholarship there, and I hope to find a job for myself. Anything, I mean. I have abandoned the therapist career, anyway. How come? Well, it's complicated. And what about… how do you call it? The internet! Will you have internet there? You're leaving for good, aren't you? -We probably are. -We don't know yet. We'd also like to come back, but… we haven't been left too much to come back to. We haven't been left too much time. From now on, I mean. -Did you check in yet? -No, not yet… -Teacher, maybe! -That would be great! I could teach to the children! -You know that I'm smart. -Yes, you are. And at night, he could tutor me. This is my house. Mine and my child's. We have nothing to discuss! Very well! Divorce! This was your great grandmother's room. She was born right there. On the 6th of September 1925, the very day when they moved in. She was your age, give or take, when they left Romania. Her grandpa, Basil-- Hey, Nadine! I'm talking to you! Her grandfather, Basil went back to France and the whole family followed him. That was the library, there. Thousands and thousands of books, imagine! So? What do you choose, then? I choose to stay with my father, I guess. Why so? He's cool; he let me do whatever I want. When is that? Tomorrow? Yeah, tomorrow at ten o'clock. Come see me when you're done. -What do you want me to cook for you? -A pizza. A cheese pizza? A Quatro Staggioni pizza. So be it! Cool. That happened in '35. In May, 1935. That's when they left. They were forced to, actually. Nadine! Then, the things got complicated… I have to go back to work. See you tomorrow. Be strong in court, promise me! Yeah, right. See you tomorrow. Looking for someone? Yes… they… I mean us… this house… before… my family… What did he say? Nadine, what are you doing? You're crazy! Where do you go? This is not nice! Nadine! And you? Are you OK with this? You don't need your bike anymore? Nadine! Just a little historical tour, mom! Why, here?! Nadine! MILENNIUM GRUP BUILT "U TOWER" MILENNIUM GRUP BUILT "U TOWER" Listen, Stoianov, someday you'll be lynched by the people who joined The-Club-of-the-Victims- Who-Were-Fucked-by-You and that will happen so fast, that you won't see it coming. I can see it's ten o'clock. Shall we grab a coffee? I've quit. Being a good girl now? Listen, Cosminel stays with me, is that clear? Yes, clear. So does the villa at the lake, right? I'm not kidding about that. About what? About the kid, or the villa? -Hello, sir! -Hello! Give me a break.
