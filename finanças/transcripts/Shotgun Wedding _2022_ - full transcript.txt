(JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) (GUN COCKS) (LOUD BURST) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (SIGHS DEEPLY) MAN 1: There she is! (CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) Gloria! Hi. Welcome! - You look great. - Thank you! - Darcy, where have you been? - Hey! Hi! I was just taking a minute. Is that allowed? Not at your wedding. - Your Ketel One martini. - Oh. Obrigada, Jerome. Where is the groomzilla? Tom is not a groomzilla, okay? He just committed to making every detail perfect. You should have taken your father's money for this wedding. Then, professionals would make everything perfecto for you. Mom, I've told you. We are adults and we wanted to pay for our own wedding so it could be what we wanted. DARCY'S MOTHER: And this is what you wanted? That was a printing error. (MUSIC CONTINUES) ♪ E is even more than Anyone that you adore ♪ And love is all That I can give to you ♪ Love is more than Just a game for two ♪ Two in love can make it (DRILL WHIRRING) ♪ Love was made For me and you ♪ - Hoy! - (CLICKING) Oh! Oh! Oh! Hey! Oh, I almost shoot you! I thought you're a pirate but you're just a guy. - (GUARD LAUGHING) - (GRUNTS) (SIGHS) Ah, this is for your bride, huh? TOM: Yeah, trying to surprise her. I saw something just like it on Etsy, and it looked perfect, but now I'm not so sure. Now, I wanna be romantic but not too corny. There's a really fine line between the two. Aren't you supposed to be over there? Your rehearsal party. Oh, my God! I need you to talk to your father's yoga teacher. - Girlfriend? - Yeah, whatever. She keeps smiling at me. Can you tell her to stop smiling at me? Yes, Mom. I will tell Dad's girlfriend to stop smiling at you. That won't cause any issues. Also, I cannot sit at a table with Tom's mother. On the boat here, she tried to start a sing-along to South Pacific. She's excited. Okay? She's never been out of the country before. What kind of a grown woman has never left the country? Please, Mom, for two days, can you just get along with... Carol! ♪ I'm gonna wash that man Right outta my hair ♪ I'm gonna wash that man Right outta my hair ♪ And send him on his way ♪ (BOTH LAUGHING) I've been looking forward to this moment ever since baby Tommy was cut out of my abdomen. - (LAUGHS FORCEFULLY) - Oh, my God, I have never been on a private island before. I've never been even on an island before. Actually, you know what? That's not true. I went with the Heibermans. We went to Mackinac, you know, before they moved to Bloomington. Have you ever been to Mackinac, Renata? I don't know what that is or most of the words you just said. CAROL: Wouldn't she just love it, Larry? Oh. Hi, Darcy. Hey, Larry. I didn't see you there. (LAUGHS) - Hi. - LARRY: Hi, Renata. CAROL: Guess what? We got you a gift. - Oh, you didn't have to. - CAROL: Yes, we did. It's the biggest day of our lives tomorrow. What are you talking about? - Come on, open it. - Okay. (CHUCKLES) - Larry, she's opening. - I get... Oh. Ah-uh-huh. Oh. Someone just left that in the bathroom. TOM: Oh, you're a lifesaver, Margy. I cannot believe I'm late for this. The guests are already mingling, and your Darcy is talking to both the mothers. Oh, no. Go. Go, go, go, go, go, go. DARCY: Oh! RENATA: You got my daughter rusty knives? It's your "something borrowed." Everyone in our family uses them on their wedding day. Brings you a lifetime of good luck. Except for Uncle Greg who ended up getting decapitated on that forklift. But that's not the knife's fault. MAN: Darcy! Dad! (PRAISES IN SPANISH) - Gracias. - BOTH: Mm. - (CAROL LAUGHING) - Carol, you look lovely. (KISSING) Mm. Mm. Larry, hello, sir. - LARRY: Hey! - I'm gonna kiss you too. - Oh. - Mm. - Sorry. Done? - Yeah, okay. Renata. Roberto. I love that you two are still friends. - Peekaboo! (CHUCKLES) - Oh. Hi! BOTH: Mwah. Mwah. Mm! Oh, Darcy, I am so honored to bear witness to this sacred observance of rebirth and devotion. - Same. - Thank you. (CHUCKLES) (GASPS) Renata. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS) I need to go to the ladies' room. CAROL: Hey, me too. When I'm in formal wear, I like to pee standing up. How about you? - Sorry. - That's okay. Thank you, Margy. Oh, hey. - Hey. - TOM: How are you? (DARCY SIGHS) - Oh. - (WHISPERS) Oh, my God. - That's for you. - Thanks. Big papi. - My man. Mwah. - (ROBERT GRUNTS) - This... I just... - Nice to see you, Dad. - Senor. - Let's just, uh, stick - with "Robert" for a little while. - (HARRIETT CHUCKLES) - Right. Robert. - HARRIETT: Tom, I heard you were the one who found this incredible resort. - Yeah. I did. - Yes. I actually study bioresonance, and this place is teeming with energetic vibrations. - DARCY: Mm. - ROBERT: It's just like - our room teeming with bugs. - (BOTH LAUGH) The, uh, Four Seasons would've been nice, but you didn't want my help, so... Some things are more important - than money, Dad. - Yeah. That's debatable. (CHUCKLES) Well, I need another drink. - Yeah. - (SPEAKS SPANISH) No, I'm good. Gracias. ROBERT: Okay, well... I'm fine. (SIGHS) Is he ever gonna like me? Yes, if you just chill out and start acting like yourself. (WHISPERS) God, our families are a lot. - What do you mean? - And where have you been? I was just finishing up a little project. What'd I miss? Oh, well, your mom gave me cursed knives. And then my mom almost yelled at my dad's girlfriend for smiling. - Oh. - Oh, also, your cousin, Amy, asked where she could charge her vibrator. Oh, so, Cousin Amy came? She will soon. - (LAUGHS) - Um, what are you wearing? Oh, it's, uh... Why is your hair all wet? Oh, I... I just... I... You know, I went for a little moonlight swim. You fell in the water, didn't you? Yeah, I fell in the water. (LAUGHING) You know, it's kinda cute how bad you are at lying. Just... Just promise me... Promise me, you won't let go of my hand for the rest of the night, okay? I promise. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS ON SPEAKERS) Ace. Ace just put on the honeymoon playlist. I need to change it. Well, is "need" the right word? - Dad, please. - LARRY: Oh, yeah. (MUSIC STOPS) Tommy, Tommy, I need you for, like, five minutes. - What? No, no, no, no. - It's an emergency. I've been working on my best-man speech, right, and it is going really well. - Hi. - Hey. - (IMPERCEPTIBLE) - (MUSIC PLAYS ON SPEAKERS) Dad's girlfriend just asked me what my love language is. She sucks. Happiest I've seen you in 20 years. - Thanks. - Cheers. (HELICOPTER APPROACHING) (UPBEAT HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING) (JAMIE GASPS) Dad invited your ex? God! How does he just keep getting hotter? Looks like he's leading a porn safari. I didn't wanna invite him, but Dad insisted because he said Bali was so close. Wow. Wow, wow, wow. Wow, wow. Dad is a messy bitch who loves the drama. DARCY: Well, he never RSVP'd, so we thought we were in the clear. I didn't think he'd actually come. You know, he never RSVP'd. No, that's a very, very cool move. I'm really excited to meet him. Oops, looks like he was in a rush and forgot to button his shirt all the way up. Deedee. (EXHALES SHARPLY) - Hey, man, how are you? - Hey. Hi, Sean! (LAUGHS) SEAN: (GRUNTS) I am so sorry that I'm late. Your dad needed me to go to Japan at the last minute, and then, you know, I had to charter a jet from Kyoto, - just like a whole thing. - No, it's okay. We just... You know, we didn't know you were coming. SEAN: Your dad and I wanted to surprise you. Look, babe, you know I wasn't gonna miss your wedding for anything in this world, right? - Sean, I want you to meet Tom. - Tom. - Oh, hey! (CHUCKLES) - Tom! - Tom, Tom, Tom. - Sean. Yeah. - Nice to meet you. - Hey, Tom. Man, I have been dying to meet Deedee's ball player, man. What position you play? - I'm a... Well, I... - He's a designated hitter. ROBERT: Uh, unfortunately, they didn't pick up his contract, so, technically, he's unemployed, but... Cut from the minors at 40. That's a tough break, Tom. But if you stay positive, you could have a really great future in coaching. You know what I mean? Yeah. That is an excellent idea. - I think so. - Thank you. Yeah. Is it time for dinner? (APPLAUSE) We are so very touched that you all made the trek out here. You know, we really wanted to pick a place that was convenient for none of you. (ALL LAUGHING) You know what, I talk too much at the law firm. So I am going to hand it over to the man of the hour, the guy who made this whole weekend happen, my lovely Tom. (CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) Thank you. - MAN: Do it! - WOMAN: You go, girl! TOM: Uh... - WOMAN 2: Yeah! - (WHISPERS) You got this. - Right? - (LAUGHTER) I can just wing this, right? Darcy talked a lot about, uh, her time in the Peace Corps in Bali, and I thought, you know, how cool would it be if we got married there. And then, I realized that Bali was un-Bali-vably expensive. (SCATTERED LAUGHTER) I think the Philippines are better. - (GUESTS CLAP) - Right, Ace? Ace agrees. Next. - WOMAN: Aw! - (GUESTS EXCLAIM) I know a lot of you were there to witness my proposal. The shock and surprise. Priceless. Anyway, Mom and Dad, I just wanna say thank you. Your commitment is something that we can only aspire to. - Oh, my God. - TOM: Robert, Renata, we hope our marriage is nothing like yours. (LAUGHING) Pivot, baby. (WHISPERS) Pivot. I mean, that's not a... a... a character judgment, by any means. I mean, 50% of marriages end in divorce, right? - (MIC FEEDBACK) - Ha! Wonderful. (CHUCKLING) Cheers, everybody. - Cheers, cheers, cheers. - Cheers. (TOM CLEARS THROAT) (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) Oh, my God. That did not go well. No, that was awesome. - (GLASS CLINKING) - (MUSIC STOPS) So Deedee and I met in the Peace Corps in Bali. And one day, we had to run these medical supplies to this village. I decided to teach her how to drive the boat, so I could sleep and she could do all the work. (ALL LAUGHING) (TOM CHUCKLES DRYLY) The first time our girl gets behind the wheel, she gets a damn speeding ticket from the coast guard. (ALL LAUGHING) Right? Deedee doesn't do anything half-assed. She sees what she wants, she goes after it, and she doesn't settle for less. TOM: It's true, it's true. SEAN: So, as some of you may know, Deedee and I were, 100 years ago, were engaged. But she called it off. (GUESTS EXCLAIM SADLY) No. No, no, no, no. She was waiting for Tom. And that guy right there has gotta be a one-in-a-million supernova to snag that beautiful soul. - Thanks. - (ALL APPLAUDING) - Thanks, Sean. - So, in conclusion, I just wanna say one thing to you, Deedee. Katuk kak ci. (LAUGHING) (ALL APPLAUDING AND CHEERING) What's... Katuk kak what? Oh, God. Um, it's hard to explain. It actually means, um, "Fuck your grandpa." (CHUCKLES) It's just... Well, that's not that hard to explain. Yeah, well, I don't know. Just, in Balinese, it's super offensive. Yeah, well, it's offensive everywhere, no? - Yeah. I mean... It just... - "Fuck your grandpa!" - It just made us laugh. - It is funny. - (GLASS CLINKS) - WOMAN: Hi, everybody. I'm Tom's baby sister, Jeannie. - Yeah, Jeannie! - Hey, Jeannie! Wow, Sean's speech, wasn't it somethin'? (CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) (SPRAY CAN HISSING) DARCY: Honey? Maybe we should just, you know, call it a night. TOM: No, babe, you go ahead. I gotta finish these centerpieces and rearrange the seating chart now that Sean decided to show up. - (GRUNTS) - Tom! Tom! (WHISPERS) Let's have sex. Yes. Yes. Just... Just... Just... Just gimme... Just... I just have to finish these pineapples real quick. Okay. Um... But do you really have to finish pineapples right now? Oh, my God. I love you in a T-shirt and no pants. (INHALES SHARPLY) I'm just gonna reach over here, this high shelf, so I can get something to read. Why is it so sexy when you can't reach high shelves? - So, um... - (GRUNTING SOFTLY) I'm sorry, miss, but it was... - It's this one here? - No, no, no. It's the one over there. - Sir, please. - Oh, this one. - This one. - Yes. - That? - Thank you, sir. Okay. Glad I could help. (DARCY GIGGLING) I miss you. It's been a while, huh? I know. I miss you. (TOM MOANS) Could I ask you a question? Is it a sexy question? Um... Just wondering why you called off the engagement with Sean again. That is so not sexy. (CHUCKLES) I... I told you this. We were young, we were in Bali, and then one day, I woke up and it just didn't feel right. - Okay? - Okay. (TOM MOANING) But you said yes. You know, what changed your mind? (DARCY SIGHS) (CHUCKLING) I don't know. Uh, he... he started working with my dad, he changed, and all he cared about was status and money. (CHUCKLES) Anyway, why do you want to talk about my ex the night before our wedding? I don't know. Maybe because you invited him to our wedding? Remember, I didn't. My dad asked me to invite him. What was I supposed to say? I don't know. Uh, no? If you remember correctly, I didn't wanna invite anyone. - I wanted to elope. - (SIGHS) The only reason I agreed to a traditional wedding was because you said that we'd have moments alone. (KNOCK ON DOOR) Hey, hello. It's Carol. Hi. Hello. Your future mother-in-law, Carol. (CHUCKLES) Yep, I know your name, Carol. I brought some of the extras for the welcome bags in case you want to make one for Sean. TOM: Oh! Oh. Great. Thanks. All right, thanks. Tommy, she's not wearing any pants. - (GIFTS CLATTER) - I just want to ask, and... and I hope it's okay. Is that genetics, or is it, like, Pilates or something? Mom, now is not the time for this. CAROL: Yes, all right. But, you know, we need to get you outta here. It's the night before your wedding, and you can't spend the night together. - No, Ma, it's just... - You can't. It's bad luck. You know, his cousin, Jenna, she spent the night with her husband. Lo and behold, she got Lyme disease, and now she can't wear sandals. It's a tradition. (SNORING SOFTLY) (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER AND LAUGHTER) (BIRD SQUAWKING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) PIRATE LEADER: Oh. Look at the happy couple. (MAN LAUGHS WICKEDLY) Where have you been? You were supposed to do my hair. Now birds are gonna lay eggs in it. I know. I overslept. I'm sorry. (CHUCKLES DRYLY) Kind of, sort of, slept with Ricky last night. - Ricky? - Yes. I'm sorry. I just, I was in the mood for something, you know, that wasn't quite right. Like ordering a hamburger at a sushi bar or something. I'm just gonna avoid him today. It's fine. He's Tom's best man. You two have to walk down the aisle together. I am very good at ignoring people that I'm standing next to. - No kidding. - Ready? I can't believe you agreed to wear Carol's wedding dress. - (SPLUTTERS) - Okay. - (JAMIE BLOWING) - Okay, okay. You look beautiful, no matter what. She's ready! JEANNIE: Hey, should we all do - a round of tequila shots? - (SIGHS) CAROL: Well, I Scotchgarded the dress, so try not to inhale the chemicals. JAMIE: Where's the veil? Where's the veil? (HUFFS) Okay. JAMIE: Well, yes, tequila. JEANNIE: Unless we get the bottle, I'm not set. JAMIE: No, no tequila. Oh! The prettiest of them all. You look so much better than the rest of us. This dress is just wonderful. I wore it for my wedding, Jeannie wore it for hers, and now you're gonna wear it for yours. Oh, my gosh. Look at you. Oh, it's white coral made out of tissue. Um... Something doesn't, you know, feel right. CAROL: Do you think if we blew-dried the veil, - it would be more fluffy? - Okay, so what I'm seeing is, I think that the left boob is actually slightly - lower than the right boob. - Like floof, floof, like that? Hey, something kinda magical happened with me last night. - Theoretically speaking... - (CELL PHONE CHIMING) would it be weird or wonderful - if we married sisters? - (CELL PHONE VIBRATES) Yeah, sure. RICKY: Hey, psst, Larry. Tom's being boring. Come film me doing a backflip! LARRY: Oh, I... I don't think I should walk. RICKY: All right. (GUESTS CHATTERING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) It's time. Wow! (SIGHS) Look at you. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) Okay. You wanted to talk. I know it's last minute. I just... I hated the way things ended last night, and... And I didn't want our wedding day to start off on a bad note. Oh, my God. (SIGHS IN RELIEF) God, I thought you were calling it off. (TOM CHUCKLING) Calling off the wedding? (SCOFFS) - Why? - Uh, I don't know. I mean, this weekend hasn't exactly gone to plan. You and I have been arguing more in the last few months than we did our first four years together. (INHALES DEEPLY) I don't know. I guess I thought weddings were supposed to be fun. Oh. Okay. Well, I'm sorry I didn't make your wedding more fun for you. Well, no. That's... Darcy, that's not what... And it's not my wedding. It's our wedding. Hardly. (SIGHS) Yeah, Tom. You got so fixated on the wedding that you... you turned into a different person. I'm sorry. I just wanted everything to be perfect. Why is that so important to you? Why isn't it important to you? It's like you don't even care about the wedding. Well, I... Of course I care. Oh, yeah? You're the one that insisted that we pay for this wedding. Yet I'm the one that's bargaining with all the vendors and DIY-ing everything, and all you're saying is, "I don't know. It looks good," you know, "Sounds good, Tom. Whatever you want." I told you that I did not want a big traditional wedding. Okay? I'm not some blushing bride. I'm a grown woman. I don't want my daddy walking me down the aisle. I don't need a big princess dress, and I certainly don't need a wedding registry. I have my things already. I like my things. I wanted a Roomba. (GUESTS MURMURING) Well, she's not up in the lobby. I can't get through on my phone. Oh, my God. They've fallen in a ditch. What? And how do you know that? CAROL: I don't know. I just have a sixth sense about these things. Ace and I will take a look around. Don't worry. We will find them. (CAROL BREATHING HEAVILY) - (SCREAMS) Check all ditches! - LARRY: God. I wanted it to just be you and me in the middle of the ocean. And for the 400th time, that would've killed my mother. Ugh. Right. And that's why I'm in your mother's dress with an extra ten pounds of hair on my head. But the truth is, you have not listened to one thing I wanted since you proposed. Okay, well, Darcy, I'm listening. Enlighten me. What is it? What is it that you want? Tom, we've... We talked about this. I told you on our very first date, I didn't want a big wedding. Well, I thought you changed - your mind about that. - (SIGHS) Why did you even agree to do it then? Oh, I... I don't... I don't know! Okay? Because... Because I love you. Because I... I w... I wanted you to be happy. PIRATE LEADER: Go! Come on, move! Everybody, move! Come on! - (PEOPLE SCREAMING) - Move along. Go outside, go outside right now. Come on. Come on. If you don't wanna go through with this, it's not too late. What? No. We brought everybody that we loved down to the Philippines for our wedding. I'm in this dress! We're doin' this! Oh, that was beautiful. Are those your vows? Oh, my God. You convinced yourself that I wanted to call off the wedding, and now you're making it happen. Oh, there you go. Lawyering yourself out of any real responsibility. (DARCY GASPS) (INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING) (GROANS) You cut me with your ring! - Won't happen again. - (GRUNTS) (MUSIC RESUMES) Great! (SHOUTING) Why don't you go be with Sean? Maybe you guys could go bang some grandpas! (MUSIC CONTINUES) I don't know why. I have a bad feeling about this. LARRY: It's gonna be fine, honey. - (SCREAMS) - (ALL GASP) I think you might be overreacting. (SCREAMS) - (GUESTS SCREAMING) - (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) PIRATE LEADER: Hold still! Get down, get down, get down! (ALL SCREAMING) (WHIMPERS) - PIRATE 1: No running! - (GUNSHOT) - PIRATE LEADER: Everyone! - PIRATE 1: Get down. PIRATE LEADER: To the pool! Now! F
