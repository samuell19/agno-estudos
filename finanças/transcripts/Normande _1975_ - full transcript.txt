Goddam thing-a-ma-jigs! Bouliane... will you make me a baby? I'll never have any kids. Here is the Holy Touch! Darn it, it's still swollen! Do you have a mirror? Christ, it's awful, and it's peeling! It takes a year to see the result. The two sides are different. Yours is the same on both sides. You're lucky... you're beautiful, with a great nose. I borrowed a lot of money for this operation... and my nose is nowhere as nice as yours. You're lucky... You've got no problems. Just a second, friends. Before we taste the cake... let's taste the girl! The only girl... - Watch it now! The only girl who is as pretty as the others! Normande, will you still remember us... when you're famous? - Of course! You sure know when it's pay day. What do you want? I know, but you won't get a damn penny, I'm fed up! Did you go and see Mom? Yes. Damn liar! Where are you staying? Same place. - Same gang, stoned 24 hours a day. You want your ten bucks? You just go and see Mom. If not, I'll drag you there. How long has it been? I don't know. You know you never went! - Okay, so I didn't go to see her! At least, say happy birthday. Oh, happy birthday. What about my medicine? Still have fits, Pierrette? - Not as often as before... Hey, how old are you? You don't know how old I am? She doesn't know how old her sister is! Know your own age? - Of course. Wait here. - Normande... I'm out of eye shadow! Anything else? Miss St. Onge? Dr Ostiguy will see you now. Sit down. I kept you out... because your mother was having a fit. Nothing too serious, but we had to sedate her. She's hard to handle. She's sleeping now... so why disturb her? It's my birthday, I'd like to see her. I have a court order for seclusion. What happened in court wasn't all that serious. Performing in sex shows... at her age is part of her illness. She has manic-depressive reactions... like 10 years ago. What do you mean, like 10 years ago? Didn't you know she already spent... a few months here? Was that type of show her specialty? I don't know. Anyway... you can't see her tonight. May I ask you something? - Yes. Do you know her well? Yes. - Is she in better health... after 4 months in here? St. Jean de Dieu Hospital... No Ma'm, it's closed. Why do you always take so long to answer? Any mail for me? Your lease's not renewed. I told you not to open my mail! Mail is something personal! I've known about the lease for 3 months. Any phone calls? - No. You mean you didn't answer? You could have cleaned up a bit. 3 letters, as if I can't read. Where will you go? I dunno. It's my birthday, I'm twenty-one! Twenty-three. Wish me a happy birthday! Come give us a kiss! I don't get you, Bouliane. You see me naked... or on the toilet, we make love... and you're too shy to kiss me! How do you know my age? - I'm 5 years older, to the day. It's your birthday? Happy birthday, Bouliane! A little kiss for each year! Lemme go, Normande! - Come on, you're all limp! Hold me! Do something! You can't get away now. A great big happy birthday kiss... Leave me alone, for crissake! You still have a lot to learn about women. Why not start now? Got my books? No time. And why do you want a book... on tropical animals? It's full of Latin words. - I just can't believe in kangaroos... walking upright and jumping 5 feet in the air... and the kids in their bellies. They just miss a zipper! - All you know is cows and pigs, you country hick! You believe in giraffes? I saw some in a zoo... a big one and a little one. But I never saw a kangaroo. And the book on mushrooms? Did you ever think of it? What? Suppose there's a war... all food is contaminated... so you go into the forest. It's fall, you see... and all there's left is mushrooms... but you don't know the good ones from the bad. You look pretty stupid! - More so if it's winter! Don't you know mushrooms can grow in the snow? Got your contact lenses on? Yeah, the damn things burn my eyes out! Wear them all the same, suffer... that'll cheer me up. Granny wants you to call Social Welfare. Tell her it's closed, and I'm tired. Give her this, it will make her feel better. Can I watch you take your bath? No Jeremy, but you oughta take one! I never touch soap. - Stay dirty then. She's got a nice ass, eh? Too bad she's too old for you. Don't be too sure! Let's go see your Granny. How is she? Not too bad lately. No trouble... In my bag, a surprise for you. I'm not making a call... I'm gonna wash your hair. No, no! Behave, or you don't get your bottle. No, no! - Jeremy... take the bottle back downstairs. I like it better like this... Mrs Veilleux. Come... washing your hair won't hurt you. The water isn't hot. - Never mind. Move over. All right, come and sit here. You'll be pretty, it won't hurt... Move your head back... Close your eyes now... There... It smells good. You'd make me happy... if you got rid of your rats. They're dirty, you'll catch a disease. When the rats attack... mine will defend me! - My God, you're stubborn! There, all finished! Jeremy, stop that! Stop it! Granny doesn't mind my playing. She's deaf, you dummy, I'm not! What's your friend's name again? Bouliane. Doesn't he ever work? - He's looking. Can't be looking very hard. Here, look at the pictures. I've got a monkey face! Stand up and raise your skirt... so I can measure your legs. How come pretty girls like you... always end up with good-for-nothings... with bums? The other leg. Miss St. Onge, Miss St. Onge! Dear Sister Marie, I leave my little Normande in your care. I'm not at all worried... having heard so much about your convent... Normande is a good little girl, but... I must tell you, she needs a lot of affection. She might be a bit shy at first. I'm sure you'll understand... she lost her father last year. And I just had another child... another daughter. ...for the Messiah, for David... and his offspring... the heavens proclaim the glory of God... Each day recounts the tale... each night passes it on... and nothing can abate His warmth. The laws of Yahweh are perfect... I'm sure she won't give you any trouble... but if she does, punish her... I'm not against it. But I'm sure... it will be all right. Her father used to say... the best education was given by the nuns. Young ladies, time for the chapel! Mrs St. Onge? You can go now. Hello Mom, you all right? You didn't eat. You feel better, don't you? Would you rather come home, Mom? You don't like it here? Look Mom, I brought you some nice flowers. Are you happy? Say... Say something, Mommy. I'll get you out of here, Mommy. So your mother isn't crazy, so what? She's crazy without being crazy... I know, she's my sister. What more could I do as a lawyer... than I had already done? I had to choose... between prison or the asylum. I couldn't choose the prison! Besides, that place isn't what it used to be. The food is good... and the staff is competent. - She's not happy. Not happy? Are you happy? Am I happy? Don't forget she was indicted on 3 counts: Theft, pornography and the assault on the judge. The sex act wasn't that serious. Normally she'd get the minimum fine. But then, if she's not crazy... why did she bare her breasts and attack the judge? Can you explain that? If she'd planned to mess up my career... she couldn't have done better! She managed that all right! I was the laugh of the court. And just after I had offered her a pension! But Mom's not that old! - It's not a matter of age... but of illness. - After all... she paid for your studies. - One year. One year and one semester. - She's got eight months left Uncle Paul! - 8 months, that's not too bad. It's for her own good. She'll be fine after this... and she won't bother anybody anymore. You want my advice, Normande? Live your own life, it's no use with your mother. She always had something against me... I never understood why. Are you still a window-dresser at my friend's store? Yes. Well, for you... maybe I can help you... a raise or something... Miss! Could you make a call for me? I have a dime. I'm Carol Chalifoux. I'm 23, like you. - You know me? - Could you call my father and ask him if I can come home? Thank you very much. You can't go home? Ask my father if I can. What's your name again? - Carol. My father is Damien Chalifoux. I think some servant answered. - It was the chauffeur. How come you know my age? - I guess. It's a gift I have. Ah, the 7th male child. - I'm an only child. My brain can X-ray people. I don't really know you, but I do. So you know me? What's my name? That's different. - Why can't you guess my name too? Names and ages are two different things. I'm Normande St. Onge. - Glad to meet you. I can say things like... - Like what? You have beautiful dark hair. - Dark eyes, a dark coat, I know that. Say something serious. What if I told you that... - What? Go on. - Your mother is in an asylum. You didn't guess that. No, I saw you there. Today you came in as I left. My father sent me there, as a boarder, shall we say? Noticed my hands? - No, should I have? Ah, you're a magician! Pick a card. The Queen of Hearts. - Okay. The Queen of Hearts... is your mother. Wow, do it again! Okay, I shuffle the cards... She's not hungry! Sit down and eat it then. Know what Bouliane's thinking about? He's thinking the food isn't good! Don't you like it? - Sure do. If it's no hamburger, you don't like it. Now stop being a hick. Do you know what he's really thinking deep down? No. Listen, Jeremy... first, I'd have to tune in to his wavelength... as if my head were an antenna... and then, I'd have to concentrate. Go on, concentrate! - Mind your own business! He practises thought transmission! - Telepathy. - He can see what's in your head, he's a magician! Magic and telepathy are two different things. Go on, concentrate! - He can't see nothing in my head! That's just crap! - I just love that kind of talk... when we're eating! - He ain't gonna bullshit me... for crissake! - It's no bullshit, it's a gift. A gift, my ass! Go on, go on, concentrate! I can't see his present, I see his past, I don't know... Go on, go on! I see him sitting on a fence, in the country. His heart is pounding, he's watching schoolchildren. He's wearing rubber boots... All the farmers wear rubber boots. He's calling someone... I can't see who it is... Go on, go on! - He takes this person... behind a building, a barn, yes, it's a barn. Now he offers... some chocolate. His heart beats faster... as he puts his arm around this person... now they're both in the hay, that's all I can say. Come on, it's not serious. - It's private, I can't say it. At least tell us the girl's name. Who said it was a girl? - You goddam fairy! Hey, let him go! Let him go, I said! Maybe he made a mistake. No, it's phenobarbital... I can't fill that out. - But I'm sick. What am I going to do? You enjoyed your party? - Oh yes! You have to be dying for people to care! See your doctor, or else go to a clinic. No I'm not, I'm going to another drugstore. They won't do it either. You're going now? If I don't show up, say I'm sick, OK? When will you take me to your dance class? Some other time. - Dammit, you always say that! So I go to the hospital... I walk right in... I take her by the hand... and we walk right out. - No one stopped you? No. - Sounds like they have a problem. No guards? I'm so glad you're here! Let me take your scarf, and your coat. I'm so glad, Mom! What kind of coat is this? How could they do this? Everything okay? - Yes, thanks a lot. We won't be able to keep her. They'll come to get her. Where else can she go? In my opinion, this is a mistake. I didn't ask for your opinion. You get it anyway. She was better off there. She had medicine, doctors, nurses... What can we do? - Get off my back, Bouliane. My leg hurts... They broke my leg! I've just what you need, Mom. Look... I bought you some nice slippers. - My leg is broken! Which leg, Mom? Which leg hurts? Which one? Jeremy, get the alcohol! - Don't you see she's raving? Nothing wrong with her leg! She'll bring us trouble. Go on! - They'll probably send the cops... Normande. You're so nice, yes, you're so nice. Nicer than people. People aren't nice at all. Gimme my bottle! I want my bottle... give it back, I need it! No respect for nobody. Thinks he can do what he wants. Drinking at his age! There must be a way! We can't hide her in a closet! Upstairs, with the old lady. - With the rats? Your leg isn't broken. Stop it, this is ridiculous. Go back to work. - Shall I take the bottle back? Can you hear me, Mrs St. Onge? Your daughter Normande is going to talk to you. Your daughter will talk to you... your daughter Normande. It's me Mom... it's Normande. Your leg isn't broken... This is ridiculous! - It's not ridiculous, it's the only way. It's all in her mind. - She wasn't crazy, you know... they made her crazy there. - I know, but what does it change? - I don't believe in this. What can we do against the judge and the cops? Look at her, look. Is that woman alive? Is she really alive? She is very beautiful... yes, very beautiful... What a shame! This one's too dark. Top quality, you know. Come down, I need your ears. Not now! - You're wasting your time. So what if I am? - So it's not all that sad. She won't see her death. Crazy people have that advantage. I envy her... but I don't envy you. With all those dark thoughts... in your head... When will you come down? I don't know. - Ears are important! They won't come tonight. That's beautiful! What are they? I sent Jeremy for her old things. A sequined dress! Isn't that fun! She was a stripper, eh? There were no Grands Ballets Canadiens in her day. If I were a woman, I'd be a stripper! There are male strippers too. I wouldn't dare, besides, I'm not gay. What are you then? I'm a problem. My father wanted me to be an engineer. You know what my dream was? I wanted to be a waiter... in a big dining-room, make things appear! Champagne, a rabbit... A chicken! - Snails, on rainy days! A man! - A woman! All good waiters are magicians. When I was a kid, I just loved to see my mother's dresses. I stayed up till two or three in the morning... sitting by the window, waiting for her to come home... but when you keep hearing your father say... that your mother is a whore... If I'd known him, I wouldn't have liked him. Is it ever hot in here! If you're not gay, please go, I must wash her. I'm leaving. Hi, I don't recognize you! How are you? Hold it! Wait! It's been so long since I've seen you! Don't you comb your hair? Just look at you! Crazy little girl! Where are your manners? Seven feet, one inch. And here, five feet seven. You let them in? - Course not, they had a key. Guess it's for the restaurant. - Fuck the restaurant! It's my home! Well, screw them. It's not my job! Six feet seven. An old boiler... Didn't you get my letters? Don't you know your lease is expiring? They're building a community center next door... and I'm turning this house into a restaurant. Everything must be cleared in two weeks! I'm glad to see you walking around, Mom. Come and sit down. I'm out of cigarettes. - Wait, I bought you some! Where are my pills? - The doctor said no more pills... I'm the doctor now. Do you want to eat? I'll make you some toast. They stole my bag in the bathroom... at the hospital. I asked the nurse to watch it... She didn't even... I'll make some coffee. - Locking me up with loonies... Here's a nice tray... like in a hotel. Madam is served! I'm not hungry. - Come on, Mom... you've got to eat a bit. Have a little bit... You want me to feed you like a little baby. Say I'm still sick. Gastro enteritis. I caught a germ. Okay, you're really sweet. Bye! What did you do to him? Tell him to mind his own business! He's prying into my affairs! Get me a damp towel! What did he do to you? - It's nothing. I just looked in his scrapbook. I could've killed him! - So you didn't, that's nice. I knew he'd kill someone! I'm calling the cops. - No! Don't! Okay... I know that kind of bum. He'll never leave. He's gonna suck around here... till we're all into shit up to our necks. Where could he go? - I don't give a damn! I saw a lot of stars... The whole milky way! Did they come? I know they're coming today. What do we do? I dunno! The colour is perfect. Now let's see the profile. Fine... Hold it. Don't move! The chin is perfect, and so are the lips. Have to fix the nose though. You cost me a lot, my dear... Your hair comes from Paris, your nails from Rome... and your eyes from New York. Take this... it'll do you good. My own recipe: A little milk, nutmeg, some ether... and a little secret. Come on, relax... forget your problems. Those bums upstairs won't help you. Trust me... Do you know what these muscles are? Trapeziuses. When they're hard like this... you must loosen up. You're sweet, but I can't. That little bugger... with his damn drums is a pain in the ass! I know a crazy woman in the asylum. Know what she does? She eats everything: Pins, nails... They had to operate on her once. Last time I saw her she was eating her hands... Sure you don't want to sleep? Your cigarette's burning, Mom. Where is Pierrette? Taking her classes right now. Oh yes, her dancing lessons. You want some toast? I'm ugly, no? I look so tired! You want me to comb your hair and make you up? I'll fix you up, okay? Say yes! I've got marks on my face! It's their fault! It's the police, mom! - It's not the police... it's those damn nuts at the hospital. They were jealous. They all jumped on me one day... I'd like to try a new hairdo on you, Mom. What if I curl it up? - I never had curls! Gimme that! I'll dye my hair... and put on an inch of makeup. My damn lawyer-brother won't see a wrinkle! They're here! You know what to do! Normande St. Onge lives here? Yes. - May we come in? Sure, but she's not in. Anyone died? Someone in there? - Yes, a boarder. He's asleep, he works nights. Anybody downstairs? - A sculptor. Upstairs? - Oh yes! Morning. I'm looking for Mrs Berthe St. Onge. Berthe St. Onge... you know her? When the rats attack, mine will defend me! Besides, I didn't get my pension cheque! It's all your fault! You play the drums? - Yeah. You any good? - Not bad... Want me to play? - No, thanks. Detective sergeant Dagenais. Do you know Miss St. Onge? There! - You know her mother? Once, I tried to do her bust, but she moved too much. Everything that moves is ugly. Movement kills life. Real beauty is motionless... perfectly static. Death is the liveliest thing I know. Like to see my mortuaries? No. You work for the wax museum? Everybody's got to make a living! Her mother was serving a sentence. I know. You mustn't wake him. Christ, can't a guy sleep here? That creep plays the drums all day! I work all night! Don't even make a hundred a week! Not even ten minutes for a crap! What the hell you want? In case you didn't know, Mrs St. Onge... is considered dangerous. - I don't know her. Well, I think you know her. And I know you too. Didn't I get you... at your father's place? You'd set fire to the garage... Try to remember that, eh? I fooled the bastards! Didn't know they were that stupid! Come, let's finish washing up. - Don't touch me, I want to sleep! You've slept enough! We're all anxious to see you pretty. My leg hurts! That's all over now, come... What are you doing here? Hi, Mom! Pierrette, my little Pierrette! You never come to see me. Are you still taking those dance lessons? Yes! - I'm the one who's taking... dance lessons, Mom. You want money, I guess? What are you doing here then? Go away. - I'm staying. You can't, Mom is sick. Go away. There is no room. Just look at her... crawling all over you. She wants something from you... I know her. Aren't you ashamed? Screw you! I want to talk to you. Open the door, Normande. You've got to forget about your little problems. Your sister's here, and your mother... we're a family. Listen, we should celebrate your mother's homecoming. She'd like that, let's give her a party! Let's get ready for the party. Some on your nose... And on the cheeks... like at the music-hall! - Wait! I don't look too feminine? Oh, my little Carol... Listen to me... I'm the girl who loves you so! I crawl into your ear... And knock on your eardrum! Open up... It's me who loves you so! You love... My geography. You love my sociology. You love the streets of my city... All my quiet little corners. But my tits... You'll love eternally! I love... I love your magic... I love... I love your telepathy. I love your feet more than your nose... But your buttocks more than the rest. And your coffee I'll love... Eternally! - Yes, that's right! Oh baby, baby... Listen to me... I'm the girl who loves you so! I crawl into your ear... And knock on your eardrum! Open up... It's me who loves you so! Come on, Mom, go on! You're pretty good, Normande! - In my time, it was different. When I did Salome... first I'd make the audience wait... and then, very slowly... I'd start moving, hips, shoulders... Feel the beat in my skin. I'd work with the lights... I loved the lights... God, was that exciting! I was in heaven! I saw you in Salome. That really got you in the gut! Maybe when my back gets better... I'll do Salome again. - Who's Salome? You little creep, don't you know Salome? Herodias' daughter, you know? No. - At your school... didn't they teach you she had St. John's head cut off? And brought to her on a platter? Well... no. I didn't see you jump on the judge... I sure would've liked to have seen that! Those are damn lies, it's made up! It was written in the papers. Everybody was on your side. That was written by goddamn liars. - Mom, you did jump on the judge. No I didn't! Of course you didn't, Mom. You stay out of this! You're hurting her. You're doing it on purpose, out of spite! - You're just going along with her, you idiot. Mom, listen to me... You did perform in filthy lesbian shows... but it doesn't matter. Mom, listen to me. We love you! Nothing wrong with showing your ass... it hurts nobody. I'm on your side, Mrs St. Onge. Breathe, come on, breathe out! Again... again, go on... You feel better now? He's a bloody bastard... that's what he is! My brother, but a bastard! I'm gonna shame him to death! He won't dare show his face! He'll end up in a nuthouse! I'm not a little old lady! I'm not old or crazy! Calm down, Mom. - I'll show him it's not true! Calm down, calm down, Mom. I don't want any more doctors. I don't want them to examine me any more... with their big filthy hands... When I die, Normande... Pierrette, don't let them... put their fingers all over me... in my mouth, on my body. You promise? - I promise, Mom. Promise? - Yes. What is it, Bouliane? Can't you sleep? Where is Carol? I'm tired, Bouliane. Then go to bed. Christ, what a beautiful face! You're all wet! I love your ass... Wait a bit... Give it to me! Don't come yet! Easy, easy, do it slowly... I'm thirsty. Go get me some water, okay? Your whole life in here? - Not all of it. Who's Anne? My first girlfriend. Then, what am I? The first chick I laid. Does your heart stop sometimes? Sometimes I must think to breathe. It's as though everything stopped. You made love with him? You can't love him. It's impossible. - I don't love him. But you made love with him, just the same. Yes. - You didn't enjoy it though. Yes. - I don't believe you, not with him! He's not for you. I too feel my heart is going to stop... and I can't breathe. I understand you. They'll be back today. Louise, sorry to call you at home. I'm not working today. Tell them... Tell them to go to hell! Bye! Go to work, I can look after myself. I don't want any sacrifice from you... I don't deserve it. I'm going to clean up, straighten things out. This place is a mess! The party was for you, Mom. Someone will have to make lunch. Tell me where the dishes are, and all those things. In the cupboard. No paper on the shelves, no place mats. Look at this, the chairs don't match the table! Looks like they come from Salvation Army! And too many plants! Why not buy plastic flowers? Yes Mom... I wanted to talk to you. You know you're a pretty girl... with a nice personality... and a good education with the nuns. You should think of your future. Try to find a nice man, with some money... who could give you a nice life. Why don't you try? Someone in advertising, maybe. You must meet some in your job... or maybe even a professional... A lawyer maybe? Can I have your shawl? I'm lending it to you. - Why not give it to her? My God, you're selfish! It's just an old shawl, give it to her. - You know she won't. She's afraid I'll be prettier than her. Better eat, it'll get cold. - Don't worry, you're the prettiest. I think clothes and money should be shared. Everything should belong to everybody. Sure, but we don't all have the same size! She thinks she can do anything, because she gives me money. You think you're the strongest, eh? Christ, I'll take the damn thing off! You want your bracelet back too? - Pierrette, don't start a fight now! Stop it! - I don't want to be judged by you! You're not my mother! - What do you want? A family fight? So let's have one. We'll say all there is to say. Are you ready? - What do you mean? Ready, Mom? - Stop that nonsense! We've got nothing to hide. First truth: I don't like you, Pierrette. The way you live and think... - Nonsense! Of course you love your sister! - You're a goddamn little opportunist! Me? I don't own a thing, I don't want anything! What about your bank account? - That's the limit! Spying on me, you bitch! How much money do you have in the bank? You've been following, you bitch! You know how you will end up? - No, how? In a white Cadillac in Miami... with a little old man! If she wants to get married, that's her business! Do you think living in misery makes any sense? She wants to be kept, not married! That's not what pisses me off. You think you're too much... but you're just about as straight as they come! Stop acting like a little bourgeoise, you're not even one! Damn it, you're mean! You know what she wants? For me to have another asthma attack. Go ahead, threaten me with your attacks! Pierrette always had problems with her lungs. It's not her fault. - Truth number two: Pierrette only pretends to love you. Just because I didn't go and see her... - You came once, but you didn't stay. Don't listen to her, it's not true. I wanted to go! Stop it! Throw Bouliane out and give Pierrette his room. We'll start again, like before. I won't throw Bouliane out. - She sleeps with him. If it hadn't been for my work... If I could have stayed at home... God, that's what I wanted! Things would be different! That's true, Mom. If you hadn't worked, and if dad hadn't died... I'm sure you wouldn't have ended up in the hospital. That wasn't a hospital, she was in an asylum several times... because her brother and the shrinks wanted her out of the way! And she went along to forget the jail sentence... Tell us you never went to jail! Leave her! Can't you see you're torturing her? Don't pretend you feel sorry for her! All right, all right, I'll go away. Oh sure! - I'll find myself a job somewhere. Get my coat, Pierrette. Well, go on. - You're heartless! You gonna let her go? You're not serious, are you? Of course not! I'm just joking. Mommy's not crazy. She never went to an asylum... and you're a liberated woman... and I'm perfect. I look after my mother and my kid sister. I'm perfect! So everything's fine. Right? Hello, Pierrette. - Hello, uncle Paul. How are you? - Fine. Is your mother here? In the other room. Hello Berthe. How are you? I'm with a friend. We've come for you. You can't stay here. Now be a good girl... I've fixed something better for you. Come on... You son-of-a-bitch! You stay away from me! Go away! Put them down. - Don't come near me, I warn you... I'll take your eyes out! Mrs St. Onge... - Stay away, I said! Those scissors won't help you. - Don't come near me! Look out! - No, no, no... Let me go... Normande! Listen, Normande... you don't know how much it hurts to do this. But put yourself in my place... You have no right, she hasn't done anything! You stay out of this, you goddam little fairy! Granny wants her gin. Get lost, you little bugger! Get out of here! So there! Come here, Normande... Lift your arm. Well, for crissake! You know the guy who walks all crooked... with a great big hat? Know what he's doing? He's sitting in the snow, burning money! Guess he doesn't know it's illegal. Guys like that don't deserve to have any money! I went for my audition, I think it'll work. The producer let me do the whole act... he stopped the others after a couple of minutes. Here, I brought you something. It's not strong, it'll calm you down. I'll come again tomorrow. It's here, but she's busy right now. Can I take the message? Fine. Just a moment, please. You have to clear out by tomorrow. Yes, okay, fine... It's leaking on my sculptures. Bring your things downstairs, okay? I let her wash my hair... and bring me my liquor... but she won't do a thing for me. She's never done a thing for me... Granny let her rats out!
