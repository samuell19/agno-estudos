[ Wind whistling ] [ Airplane engine humming ] [ Engine shuts off ] >> Senor Guido? Ah, but of course. This hazardous business, one must be sure. I'm Ramirez. >> Yeah, why don't we just take care of business? >> I appreciate your willingness to help us in our cause, my friend. I only wish your government was as sympathetic. We are involved in a great struggle. The freedom of our people -- >> OK. Now, what kind of weapons and munitions are we talking about here? >> I have a list. >> I don't need no damn list. You know what I'm after. >> Narcotics are no problem, my friend. We produce the finest cocaine in the world. Our revolution must succeed. >> Let's take a look at the list. I don't see any problem. >> Excellent! Then, things are settled. Terms as we discussed? >> You got it. But that shit better be top-drawer, jack. You understand? I'll be in touch. [ Engine starts ] [ Upbeat music plays ] [ Vehicle approaches ] >> Halt! Police! [ Gunfire ] >> I can't believe it. I actually finished lunch without us getting a call. >> [ Over radio ] 12-Keller-7... 12-Keller-7. 211 robbery in progress. 1827... >> That's us. >> Had to open your big mouth, huh? >> [ Laughing ] Come on! [ Engine starts ] [ Tires screech ] [ Siren wails ] [ Gunshots ] [ Tires squealing ] >> We got one. The other's on the roof. >> Right. [ Gunshots ] >> Come on, let's get that chump. >> Carmen! No, come on, this way. >> Hey, hold it! It's me -- Stephanie Adams, Channel 6! >> Me, too! >> You almost got your black ass blown away that time. You two stay here, you got it? [ Gunshots ] All right, I'll take the roof. You get around behind. >> All right. Freeze, mister. [ Gunshots ] Hey, man, you all right? >> I'm alive. [ Funky rock music plays ] >> You shoulda seen our heroes swing into action. They were terrific. But I missed a shot of you wasting the bad guy. Next time, why don't you get closer to the roof? >> You know, you may think it's all fun and games, sweetheart. One of these days... >> Are you all right? >> Sure. How 'bout you? What's happening with the old man? How's the parole coming? >> Well, his attorney says that his case comes up for review again in November. >> Guess that means more money. >> Oh, it always means more money. Which reminds me... I've gotta go get my act together. >> Tony? You're hurt! Are you all right? >> Hey, it's just a scratch. >> Looks like, uh, Terry and Tony gonna play doctor. >> Hmm, I can dig it! See y'all at the club tonight! >> All right, now. Take care. >> Hey, that's nothing to joke about. He coulda gotten killed. >> Hey, what about me? I was there, too. >> Hmm, some partner. Come on, baby. You have some battle wounds. >> Now, there's a girl who knows what she likes. >> Hey, hey, hey. Whatchu lookin' at, boy? >> [ Sighing ] Nothing. >> Good, 'cause that's exactly what you're gonna get. Nothing. Hey. Truce? >> It's good you didn't get hung up with Terry today. This could be important. How's the arm? Still hurting? >> Nah, it's OK. >> Look, if you had more natural rhythm, man, you wouldn't get clipped like that. You've got to have some moves, baby. You don't see old Kicks catching no lead, do you? >> Nah, the only thing you're catching is Stephanie. And I thought you were smart. >> Hey, come on, look who's talking. Terry's had you hung out and dryin' for days. >> And I don't mind a bit. I like that in a girl. >> Yeah, for a while, I was wondering about that, her living at the hotel and all. >> The Queen's Castle? Some hotel. You know as well as I do, that's just a front. Shit. Ziggy spends more time in the joint than he does out. 5 to 10 for armed robbery. And Fay? She's not too clean, either. Yeah, they're the ones doing the using. They've been ripping off girls like Terry all along. >> Tony, what are you trying to say? >> What I'm saying is that girls living in that hotel have fingered at least five major heists in the last two years. And then, conveniently, disappeared or been snuffed. >> Yeah, I dig. Which makes Terry a natural. Her working for that big securities outfit and all. >> You got it. >> Well, I got to believe there's more to it than that. >> Hey. There's your man. >> Yup. >> Well, it's your turn to play detective. >> Thanks. [ Funky music playing ] >> All right, Shaft, do your stuff. [ Music cuts out ] >> All right, everybody just be cool, take it easy. Ah, there's my man. >> Hey, what's this shit? >> You gotta pee again, chump. That's what. >> Aw, man! >> Hey. I wouldn't do that. [ Struggling ] He's not gonna look very pretty when he comes out. [ Banging ] >> Ahh, goddamn it! >> Hey, you make a great sound with those Berties, Alphonse. [ Chuckling ] So, what's the story? >> [ Sighs ] Not sure. Something big's going down. Guy named Guido's the contact. Big dude. Brotha out of Detroit, shaved head and all. Got a mugshot of him here somewhere. Drugs are his usual thing. I don't know, maybe a big buy's going down here. He's hooked up with the Queen's Castle, I do know that. >> Queen's Castle? >> [ Chuckling ] Thought you'd like that. I know you and your partner's been trying to nail that joint for a while. So, when I got the rumble on the dude, I decided -- >> All right, all right, um, what else you got? >> He did some time with Ziggy in Folsom in the '60s. You know, that clown that muscles for the boss lady. [ Chuckling ] Pretty, ain't he? What I can't figure out is why this dude's messin' around with those people? I mean, they're small timers. He's heavy duty. Just doesn't figure. >> Yeah, well, what else you got? >> That's it, brotha. Wish I could give you more. [ Laughing ] >> Yeah, me too. Sorry, brother. You OK? >> The hell was that for? >> Well, we gotta make it look real, don't we? >> Thanks for the warning. Damn, look at that face. >> Eh, you wasn't exactly a Cadillac when you pulled in here. [ Laughing ] The hell can you say that? You ready? >> Yeah, let's give 'em a show. [ Pool balls clinking ] [ Alphonse breathing heavily ] >> Now, you better keep your nose clean, black beauty, because the next time I come around, I'm gonna straighten the rest of it out. Give the folks some music, Sherlock. All god's children got rhythm. [ Funky music playing ] Come on, folks, enjoy yourself! >> What went down? >> I'll run it down to you later. Right now, we got just enough time to go change and meet the girls at the Hunt Room. What are you grinnin' at? >> You. I like the way you lean on your own people. No partiality, totally color-blind. Oh-ho, you're my kind of cop. >> Fuck you. [ Quiet piano music playing ] >> * No more mail * Until tomorrow * Still have a lonely day ahead * * I've got so many things * I need to do * But I know I'll end up missing you instead * * A postage stamp * A piece of paper * Mail from wherever you may be * * Time enough to write * An "I love you" * You see, those words mean everything to me * * And I know you'll come to me * As soon as your time is through * * Then I can say goodbye * To loneliness and sorrow * But I need you so * And I have to know * That you're still missing me * But now * There's no more mail * Until tomorrow * Each day's another hill for me to climb * * But I'll get through * And, baby, it's so hard * To live on promises * Because nothing ever takes the place of you * * Nothing ever takes the place of you * [ Applause ] >> Kicks. You better lay off this stuff. Something just might happen. >> She's trying to lead me from the path of righteousness into the clutches of demon rum. >> Amen, brotha. [ All laugh ] >> Bad girl. >> Oh, it's gonna get worse than that. Stand up. >> Oh, man, worse than that. You mean there's something worse than this buzz I already got? >> [ Slurring ] Let us not forget last cent-- It means we're going skinny dipping. [ Terry laughs ] >> Terry, I have to take care of something. I'll be back in a couple minutes. >> OK. [ Smooches ] >> Guido! Assume the position. >> Right side, cop. I got a permit. >> Heh, who gave you a permit? What are you doing here? >> Just stopped by for a drink. >> You're a long ways from Detroit. How's your friend Ziggy? >> Ziggy? You're way outta line, honky pig. How does it feel now, cop? [ Tony grunts ] [ Scuffling ] >> Just how the hell long were you standing over there? >> Well, uh, Tony, you know, I don't want to interrupt any of your conversations unless I feel they're really serious. >> Well, look, when there's three of them and one of me, it is serious. >> Yeah, well, I realized that when he called you a honky pig. [ Laughing ] >> But what do you want to do with him? You wanna take him in? >> Uhh, why don't we just leave him for the garbage collector to pick up? Later. >> Hey, Terry, what's happening? >> Ziggy, we have nothing to talk about. >> Oh, come on now, Terry. How come you don't come around here and visit us anymore? We're still holding some of your IOUs, you know. Yeah, that's right. Your credit here is still good. >> Ziggy, I'm through with it. I don't play cards, dice, or the horses anymore. I'm through. Do you get it? I don't gamble. >> Aww, ain't love grand? But you know, you gotta figure out how to pay off those debts some way. I think I know the way. >> Cut it out, Ziggy! >> Come on. >> Come on! >> Oh, go ahead! Go ahead, take a poke at me. >> You all right? What you doin' with this creep? >> Come on, Tony, I'm all right. Let's go, OK? >> Wait a minute. Come on, I want to see you take a poke at me, huh? Especially in front of all these people. [ Laughing ] All these witnesses? Ohh, boy, I'd love to slap a -- a brutality suit on ya. Yeah, come on! >> You lay as much as one finger on her... >> Wait a minute, wait a minute. Look, look, look. [ Laughing obnoxiously ] [ Grunting ] [ Moaning ] >> I'm sorry, Ziggy. I slipped. >> We can come back and skinny dip later, OK? >> You jive turkey, you're just trying to get in my pants. >> What are ya talking about? You haven't got any pants on. Come on, please. I gotta get up early in the morning. >> If you want me, you come in and get me. >> You don't think I will, huh? All right, we'll see about that. >> Come on, turkey. [ Door opening ] >> Well? What happened with Terry? [ Ziggy chuckles ] >> That's just it, baby. Nothing happened. Cop boyfriend of hers came busting in on us. First he rousts Guido, right? Then he punches me in the stomach. I'm tellin' ya, he's asking for it, Fay! >> [ Wearily ] I hear you. Look, all we're interested in is Terry. Once she tips us to which messenger is delivering those securities, I don't care what happens to either one of them. >> Yeah, that's -- that's fine, Fay. But meanwhile, that cop is nosing around here, getting in everybody's way. >> So, what do you suggest? You haul out your cannon again? You just blow him out? >> No, baby, I suggest that we let him keep -- keep nosing around here. Him and that nigger partner of his, huh? Keep clockin' our action. Then, when they pull the covers off us, the D.A. steps in. Now, does that sound better? Huh? >> All right. Get rid of him. >> I knew you'd see it my way. >> But with a lot of style. >> Oh! >> And clean. >> Real clean, real clean. [ Playground chatter ] >> Next Thursday! [ Engine starts ] [ Gunshot ] [ Tires squealing ] [ Gunshots ] [ Tires squealing ] [ Loud crashing ] >> Anyway, that's the story the way we got it. He died instantly. >> * Now, honey, listen to me before you walk out that door * * Let me talk to you some more * And if you reachin' out to touch me, you can squeeze my little hand * * If your lonely nights are over, why you dancin' to a rock 'n' roll band * * Now, shake a leg, baby * Shake a leg, baby * Shake a leg, baby * Shake a leg, baby * Shake a leg, shake a leg * Yeah, shake a leg, mama * Shake a leg, honey * Shake a leg, baby * Shake a leg, baby * Shake a leg, shake a leg * I can do a little show * You can do one for me * Stand up and get your kicks for free * * Yeah, shake a leg, baby * Shake a leg, baby * Shake a leg, baby * Shake a leg, baby * Shake a leg, shake a leg * Shake a leg, honey * Shake a leg, baby * Shake a leg, baby * Shake a le, shake a leg * Now, shake a leg, baby * Shake a leg, baby * Shake a leg, mama * Shake a leg, honey * Shake a leg, shake a leg [ Funky music playing ] [ Pool balls clattering ] >> Hey, big time. You lookin' for me, baby? >> We're looking for somebody. You don't think we'd come into this toilet for nothing, do you? >> That would make you the heavy-duty one. War weapons. What exactly you looking for? >> Sit down. >> Maurice said you were connected. You'd better be. >> I know who and what's worth knowing. >> When can you deliver? >> Hey-y, cool yourself! I mean, I ain't exactly sittin' on it, baby. Take a little time. >> I ain't got time. >> I can get it. But it's gonna cost you, bro. >> I thought you told him our price. >> He did. But we ain't exactly talkin' about a used Cadillac now, are we? You want high-shelf merchandise and you want it in a hurry, you gotta pay the dealer, baby. 'Bout twice that amount oughta do it. 200,000 little ones oughta tighten us right up. >> 200,000. >> TCB. Gotta take care of business, little brotha. And my people ain't partin' with Don Juan until I rub that cash, you understand? >> This better be new goods, or I'm gonna do this town a public service. >> Nice man. >> The 15th. No later. >> You got it. Hey, whatchu gonna do with all that artillery? Start a war? >> The 15th. >> Eh, Darnell! Get the people a drink, man! >> And you'd better deliver. >> H-hey, what's the hurry? I mean, let's socialize, man! I don't even know where you guys are staying! I mean, what if I need to call you or something? Come on. >> I do the contacting. [ Siren wails ] [ Indistinct chatter ] >> All right, Steph. You guys stay right here. No closer, and I mean it. >> What's going on? >> A terrorist assassination attempt -- has hostage, wants plane, wants car, wants money, so forth and so on and blah, blah, blah. >> Yeah, tune in next week. >> Look, he'll be out any minute now. You just stay here, sweetheart, OK? I don't want to be the one to have to pick your little lovely ass up piece by piece. >> Hey, hey, hey. The man's worried about me. Why don't you stop by the apartment later? We can watch the replay on the news. >> We'll see. [ Siren chirps ] >> Nicholas! Now, just take it easy, Nicholas. We got you the car, and the way is cleared to the airport. There won't be any trouble. >> Pig! Lying pig! You lie to your own people! You lied to Lumumba, you lied to Martin Luther King, and you're lying to me! >> The car is right in front of the entrance. I'm looking at it now. >> See this? I'm wired to a bomb! This is a dead man's switch. You try anything, I'll kill us all! [ Struggling ] [ Woman crying ] [ Loud blast ] >> A police spokesman reported that the former mental patient accidentally caused the device to explode. Both he and the hostage perished in the ensuing holocaust. The victim's name has been withheld, pending notification of next of kin. And now, for the weather. >> Hey, nice job, Steph! >> Eh, it was OK. Still trying to convince my boss to give me an on-camera job, though. >> Hey, by the way, what's been happening with Terry lately? >> She's been on a gambling binge ever since Tony. >> What room is the game in tonight? Come on, baby. We both know what's been going on around this girl's hotel. >> OK, so you know. There's a few chicks into that shit. >> It's a little bigger than that, honey. >> So? What do you want from me? >> Well...we can start with a little bit of... >> Terry, darling, where have you been? We were worried. >> Vegas. >> Ahh, hope you won. >> Ehh... Where's the game tonight? >> Room 325. >> My credit still good? >> Sure. [ Knocking on door ] >> Bob? >> Hey, Terry, hi. How are you? >> Hey, Bobby! Good to see you! [ Indistinct conversations ] Hey, Kicks. What you said before... you weren't serious about Fay and Ziggy, were you? >> No. Look, there have been five major heists in the last two years. The only connection between them all -- all inside jobs. Now, what would that have to do with the Queen's Castle? >> Hey, I got it. In each case, the rip-off involved a chick who lived here, right? >> You got it. It was all Tony's idea. That's why he hooked up with Terry. Figured she just might be the next likely candidate. >> Especially since she works for that, uh, security transfer place. >> Yeah, plus it gave him a chance to hang around here a lot. >> I wish there was something we could do. >> [ Inhaling deeply ] Well, the best thing we could do is just leave her alone. She's gotta work it out herself. You've done enough lying to her boss about her poor, sick mama. While she's out running around having sprees. >> Baby, she's in a spot. I'm just trying to help. She would do the same for me, Kicks. >> Are you sure? >> Yeah, I'm sure. She doesn't realize what she's doing. Or why. >> If I could only get an angle... >> What? >> Nothing. I'm... just thinking about Tony. He was just like a brother to me. >> Would it help if I snooped around a little? >> Look, just stay away from it, OK? Just don't mess around with it. Ziggy wasted Tony. He's not gonna give a damn about putting away a little snoopy reporter. Now, come on. >> Yeah, but what a story. [ Kicks sighs ] >> You don't think I could just look the other way now, do you? >> Just stay out of it, or -- >> Or what? >> Or I'm gonna bite your little ass! >> [ Laughing ] Ouch! Aah! Ow, OK! >> Ante up, gentlemen. [ Indistinct conversations ] Watch out next time! >> See ya, Terry. [ Telephone buzzing ] >> Sergeant Carter. >> Kicks! This is our man in the ghetto. The man that's gonna get you your promotion. >> Yeah, sure. Uh, give me an update. >> That dude's put in an order big enough to arm all the African nations. He wants everything, from automatic weapons and explosives to nail clippers. And it wants it, like, yesterday. >> How in the hell do you figure on delivering? >> Hey! He's dealin' with Trader Al, baby! I can get them. People I'm dealin' with sittin' on everything I need. But the one thing they haven't got is the bread. They'll be only too willing, baby. >> Hey, look, it's getting a little bit heavy, man. >> Sure it is! But dig -- that can put me in on both sides. First, we get this Guido. I really want to nail his ass. >> Yeah, I wonder what his game is. If it's narcotics, then he's damn slick. And why the hell he needs Fay and Ziggy, I'll never figure that one. Just doesn't add up. >> Yeah, I know. But we've got to deliver. We can't have him goin' around scoring weapon and ammo on his own. It's got to be through us. We're too close to this now. >> Yeah, well, look, if you need anything from my end, let me know. Hey. Be careful. Keep a low profile. >> [ Chuckling ] Low profile. I turn sideways, jack, and you won't even see my black ass. Hang tough. [ Receiver clicks ] [ Knocking on door ] >> Answer the door. [ Indistinct conversations ] >> Come on in. >> Guys, it's Terry! >> Hey, hi, Terry, how are you? Hey, come on, guys. Sit down. Fresh money. >> Watch out, guys. You're tangling with lady luck tonight. >> Oh, yeah? >> Yup. You just wait and see. >> Hey, I'll tell you what. Let's, uh, make it interesting and put an ace up, huh? Five card stud, huh? How 'bout that? >> All right. >> You like anything. [ All chattering ] >> OK, what do we have here? >> Put an ace up, you guys. Come on. There we go. >> I don't know about, uh, playin' with women. >> Cards are on the table. Here we go. Look at this, huh? Got an eight ball. Got a cowboy. Got another jack. All right, Ken, you bet. Come on, baby. >> I shouldn't be in the game. [ Indistinct conversations ] >> Here's 40, and here's another 10. >> Good night, Louise. All of you. >> Aces and all. [ Indistinct conversations ] >> OK, OK...10. [ Indistinct conversations ] >> You're really speeding. >> Yeah. [ Indistinct conversations ] >> Bet 200. >> Too rich for my blood. >> I'm light a hundred. >> No, honey. No way. >> Table stakes. House rules. You got anything, a watch or something? >> What am I worth? >> What do you mean? >> If I lose, I'll take you all on. >> When do we collect? >> Now. If I lose. I call. Aces full. >> No way, honey. >> Four little sevens. 28. All right, boys, line up. [ Struggling ] [ Terry shrieking ] >> God damn right I won the bet, sweetheart! Get over here! [ Loud smack ] >> No! [ Terry whimpering ] >> Yes, sir. >> Please! No! >> A bet's a bet. >> Stop it! [ Crying ] No! Stop it! [ Clock ticking ] [ Clattering ] >> Boy, look at all that money. Wow, you must be rich! >> What do you want, Ziggy? >> [ Laughing ] Just hanging around. >> Why don't you hang out a little further away? >> Come on now, Val, that's -- that's not being very friendly, is it, hmm? Why can't you be nice to me for a change? Here, I'll help you with your money. Aww, I'm sorry. >> Cute. You know, you're about as much fun as cancer. >> Hey, you're gettin' real clever. You -- you're developing a real salty mouth, you know that? >> Why don't you leave me alone? You're not my scene, Ziggy. I don't bother you. >> [ Sleazily ] Ahh, that's just it, Val. You do bother me a -- a lot, you know? >> You're hurting me, dammit. >> Hey, let me ask you something, hmm? Let me ask you something. You got that old man in prison, and he's been there for such a long time, how come I never see you with anybody, huh? I mean, what are -- what are ya savin' all that precious meat for, huh? >> My old age. Now, will you let me go? >> Hey, you know what they're doing to that old man of yours in prison, don't ya? You know what the guys there do to him. By the time he gets out of jail, he's gonna never want to look at another woman again. [ Laughing obnoxiously ] >> You make me sick. He's 10 times the man you are. >> Aw, there goes that real serious mouth again. >> You and Fay deserve each other. You're both a couple of sickos. >> Ohh, sock it to me, sicko. >> Here's a dime. Why don't you go call somebody who gives a shit? >> Oh, all right, what should I call him? >> Look, what do I have to do to get rid of you? What do you want me to do, scream? Oh, you'd really like that, wouldn't you? Oh, OK. I'll play your little game. [ Screaming ] >> Shit. >> [ Screaming ] Ziggy! What the hell is this? [ Ziggy groans ] You OK? >> Yeah, just great. Why don't you call your goddamn dog off? >> Ziggy, get in here. Now! >> Did you hip the girl yet, Fay? But what are you waiting for? Straighten her out. What the fuck's keeping you? Well, lean on her, Fay! I need some action now, or I'm out. No, I don't think you do understand. If I'm out, where does that leave you? Wrong. Not only do you lose your cut, but you're out of business, period. You and Ziggy. Got it? [ Slams down receiver ] [ Knocking on door ] >> Come in. Sit down. >> Uh...no, thanks. I'm in a hurry. >> Suit yourself. You've been leaving your IOUs with some pretty rough people. I just done you a favor and bought 'em up. Almost 15 grand. >> 15,000? Oh, God. >> Hey, sweetheart. Come on. Relax. >> Fay, I don't have this kind of money. >> You don't necessarily have to pay with money. >> What do you mean? >> You could get me some information from that stock and security place where you work. You've done it before. >> You mean like an inside tip on the stock market? >> Yeah, sure, that's it. But not really a tip. I need some information about the movement of one of your messengers. >> Fay, you know I don't have access to that kind of information. >> Hey...then, you're gonna have to pay up. Cash. Today. >> I can't! I don't have that kind of money. Where am I going to get that kind of money? >> Hey, hey. Don't break down on me again. I'm perfectly willing to give you a little time. >> A little time? >> Sure. You ask me real nice... and I'll give you a couple of days. [ Terry crying ] >> Hey, I thought you were taking me home. >> Relax. I gotta make a quick stop. It's just a little out of the way. >> Hi, Ziggy! How are ya? Hey, uh, let me get rid of this water. I'll be right back. [ Trunk creaking ] >> Um, I'm gonna have that payment for you soon, but I -- I just don't have it right -- Oh! No, no! Ziggy, that's my car! Ziggy, that -- I -- I'm gonna work it out! Don't do it! Aw, geez. I need this car to get to work! No, no, no! Zig, don't! I -- I'm gonna have to walk to work if I don't have a car. Come on, Ziggy. I can't -- if I can't drive to work, how the hell am I gonna pay ya? [ Glass shattering ] No, Ziggy! I need this car! My wife has been sick, and I haven't had the money. [ Sobbing ] Jesus. My -- no! [ Crashing ] How am I gonna get any money if I can't get to work? God, I need work! You'll get your money! [ Banging ] Goddamn it, Ziggy! What did you do that for? Now I can't even get to work. [ Man groaning ] [ Engine starts ] >> Ziggy, what are you doing? [ Man choking and gasping ] [ Screaming ] [ Tires screeching ] >> [ Gasping ] >> Boy, you sure have beautiful legs. Hate to have anything happen to 'em. >> That messenger must carry over a quarter of a million dollars in negotiable securities. Thanks. And then, he wants me to call him and tell him th-the time he's going and the route he's gonna take. >> Well, I think we should call the police. >> I can't do that! Ziggy'd kill me! >> Yeah, and he will, too, if Kicks is right. He thinks Ziggy killed Tony. >> [ Whispering ] Oh, my God. >> Look. I got an idea. After you call Ziggy about the messenger, you call me. I'll follow him and film the whole rip-off. We'll nail Ziggy cold, and you'll be safe, OK? [ Gunshot ] >> Hey! How you doing? Whatcha got? >> Take a look at this. [ Projector runs ] [ Piano music playing ] [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Projector runs ] >> That's some heavy shit. You gotta be crazy, messin' around like this. Why in the hell didn't you call me first? >> I'm sorry. I didn't think they'd actually kill anyone. >> Jesus Christ. Where are they now? >> I don't know. Probably back at the club. Val's hanging out to keep an eye on things. >> Hanging out where? >> At the club! >> I suppose Terry's there, too? >> No, she's at work, waiting for me. >> Well, look, you call Val. Tell her to get the hell out of there. And you pick up Terry and catch up with me later, you got it? >> Yeah, all right. >> Now! [ Telephone ringing ] >> Hello? >> Is Valerie there? >> Val? It's for you. >> Who's this? >> Who do ya think it is? It's Ziggy. >> Oh, hey, Ziggy. How ya doin'? >> OK. It's Stephanie. >> Hi. >> Hey, look, I realize you can't talk, so just listen. I saw the whole thing. It was terrible. They killed the messenger. I saw Kicks, and he's on his way over there with the cops. Now, we got all the evidence we need, so get out of there right now. >> OK, I'm on my way. [ Gasping ] [ Screams ] [ Siren wails ] >> All I wanna know is what evidence is Stephanie talking about? [ Valerie groaning ] [ Loud slap ] Sweetheart, I got ways of hurting you you don't even know about. [ Valerie moaning ] You want me to lean on your old man? Huh? >> Baby, one phone call from me, and we can snuff him out like that. [ Valerie grunting ] >> I'm not kidding! >> Look, I'm just a piano player around here. I don't know nothin' from nothin'. >> She's lying. [ Telephone ringing ] Hello? >> Ziggy, this is Kicks Carter. Place is surrounded. You have five minutes -- [ Slamming down receiver ] Get in position. [ Buzzer sounds ] >> What is it? >> Your world's about to come down around your head, baby. The cops are here. You guys cover the back door, huh? Ed, you and Mel cover the front door. >> What do we do about her? >> Ah, she's just another loser. Better forget about her. Come on, let's head for the roof. [ Gunshots ] [ Sobbing ] [ Gunshots ] [ Gun cocks ] [ Sobbing ] >> Val, are you all right? >> [ Sobbing ] The roof. Ziggy. >> OK, take care of her. [ Sirens wailing ] >> Hold it! [ Gunshots ] [ Gun clicks ] [ Metal clattering ] [ Grunting ] >> Nowhere to run, huh, Ziggy? It's all over, Ziggy. I'm taking you in. >> The hell you are, you nigger cop bastard! One more step, and you're gonna end up just like your partner! Rawr! [ Laughing ] [ Grunting ] [ Crashing ] >> Thank you, ladies. I'll get your friend to the ambulance. [ Police radio chatter ] >> You all right, huh? [ Funky music playing ] [ Telephone ringing ] >> Hello? >> Yeah, give me Alphonse. >> Alphonse! >> Trader Al. >> This is Kicks. >> Hey, hold on. [ Music volume lowers ] OK, what you got, baby? >> Look, man, we got problems. We nailed Ziggy, but Guido got away. I winged him, I know that much. >> Yeah, well, hey, don't worry about that. You'll get another shot soon enough. The bait's set for sun-up. And hey -- don't let him slide this time, OK? >> Oh, where are you making the switch? >> I don't know, that's up to him. Somewhere in the hills. >> Look, now, how in the hell am I gonna -- >> H-hey, relax, little brotha. Everything's covered. I put a homing device inside the crates. Just give brother Al a little chance to make the delivery. Follow the bounding red ball, baby, and that nasty nigga's all yours. >> Yeah, you make it sound pretty simple. >> It is, baby! You're dealing with Trader Alphonso, great gun dealer of the Western world. Just like milk and honey. We give everything but green stamps. >> Yeah, just like the neighborhood supermarket. >> Later, baby. >> We've been after that slick son of a bitch for two years, so we should think you can get him? >> We'll get him. >> You federal narcs are spending too much time on paperwork and expense accounts, instead of getting on the street where the action is. >> What's the matter, baby? Somebody tried to scalp you? [ Chuckling ] Hey, it's boss goods, baby. Already checked it out. Only been used once, by a little old school teacher in Watts. [ Laughing ] >> You're a regular Flip Wilson, ain't ya? >> Another day, another dollar. Nothing to it, baby. Hey, if you want to do this again, hey, let me know. I'll deliver all you can buy. >> It's A-1. Check it out yourself. [ Gunfire ] >> H-hey, what you trying to do, baby? Wake up all around? [ Laughing ] >> I'm glad you're having fun. >> I dig my work, baby. That's all. >> Here. Count it. >> Oh, no need for that, brotha. I trust you. [ Door slamming ] >> I want you to count it. We won't be doing business again. [ Racking gun ] >> Hey. Man -- what's this, brother? >> You were too greedy, sport. >> Oh, wow. [ Gunshots ] >> And you never were funny. >> They must be just testing the guns. >> Better hope so. [ Beeping ] They're moving. Let's go. [ Engine starts ] [ Beeping ] >> Look! There's his truck. [ Beeping ] >> Well, they're stopped again. I'll take a look. Well, they're waiting for something. So, we wait, too. >> Yeah. [ Airplane engine humming ] >> This could be it. >> Yeah, looks like it's gonna land. >> Call the men. Tell them to move up -- now. >> OK, guys, bring 'em on over! >> Where in the hell are those guys? They should have been here by now! >> Don't worry about it. They'll be here. >> Yeah, well, you wait for them! I can't afford to waste any more time. You coming? [ Indistinct conversation ] [ Indistinct conversation ] >> All right down there! Drop your weapons and walk this way with your hands up! [ Gunfire ] Move around from the side. [ Gunfire ] [ Airplane engine starts ] [ Gunshots ] >> They got the auxiliary tank!
