Hi. How are you ladies? Here. Chicken? Mild butter chicken. Order up. Behave yourself, put this in your lap and eat. No. Hey. Look, Mom. Hi, welcome to Spirit of India. How many in your party? - Four, please. - Right this way. Here you go. I will be back to take your orders in a few moments. Dishes. Kitchen. Now. The maître d' doesn't do dishes. We don't have a maître d'. But you do have an older sister, she is telling you to go do the dishes. - Irrelevant. - Rohan. Dad! A moment of your time to discuss... We are not putting tikka masala tacos on the menu, Rohan. They're called Tik-Tacos. We have rotis, we have Frankies. They're like burritos. But a burrito is not a taco. You've given me a lot to think about. No. Rhea, Nani wants you in the kitchen. Ugh. Dad, is she gonna fix my hair again while we're slammed? I don't know. I want her to be prepping and chopping, not chatting and fussing. - Now, hurry up. It's a busy night. - Copy that. Looking very nice, sonny. Just keep reducing it, okay? Ganesh, table number five is still waiting. - Hurry it up, darling. - On it. Mild on the butter chicken. Rhea, don't move. Look at you. It's Sunday night. You've got to make a bit more effort. Can't have people saying my own granddaughter doesn't look presentable, huh? Hmm. And your father is no help. Someone has to teach you these things. Okay. - Wait... - Can you do that anywhere but here? But who wouldn't be thrilled to find my eyebrow hair in their biryani? Will... Will you just hold still? All right. Better. For tonight, at least. Okay, if we're done here. Oh! - Rhea. - I can handle it. Yeah, and you handle far too much. Chalo. Table number seven is still waiting. Run like the wind. Arvind. Look at your daughter. All of this working and lifting and sweating she's doing. She's young! She should be enjoying life. Maybe she'd enjoy life more if you didn't fuss over her looks at every dinner rush. - Nonsense. She loves it. - No, she doesn't. She told me. If she didn't love working here, she would tell me that too. Nani! Can Shilpa Auntie have the rest of her food? Shilpa? Come along, Arvind. You should talk to her. - Oh, yeah, I'd love to, but... - Now. Shilpa. Vinay. How are you? Good, good! Rhea was just telling us that she is the new president of her school's coding club. My Sahil could give her some pointers. He's the founder of his school's cryptocurrency club. Splendid. And how much of your money has he lost so far? Don't ask. Now, Shilpa, I understand you have some company coming to town. My younger sister Shanti is flying in from Mumbai. Uh, you remember Shanti. She ate here once about five years ago. Of course. How could I forget? Terrific. How's Monday night? Dad! Let's get Auntie and Uncle some mango lassis, on the house. Excellent idea. We'll be right back. How many sisters does Shilpa Auntie have? That's like the fifth one she's wanted to set you up with? She's just doing what aunties do. Uh-huh. Okay. Sure. What? Please handle that. My boss will not listen to reason and implement my idea. That's something you want to see… - You know that boy? - Yeah. Max. He goes to my school. What is he doing here? I'm gonna take a wild guess and say eat. …an open-concept kitchen, so that way the... - Hey. - Hey. - Go see Nani. - Why? She is just dying to hear all your renovation ideas. Yes! I knew this day would come. Hi. And welcome to Spirit of India. Hey. I know you. Uh, yeah. Biology? Calculus. I'll show you to your table. Cool place. Thanks. It's my family's restaurant. This place reminds me of that Indian place we used to go to in Upton Park. Hmm. - Here you are. - Thank you. Uh… "Free Fall Universe," DJ Luka Cent. When did Luka Cent drop a new track? Late last night. I just happened to be up after closing, so I grabbed it for my dinner rush playlist. Wait, you made this mix? I made this mix. Do you make your own stuff as well? Oh, no, no, no. I make these playlists because I noticed that things around here go a lot smoother when there's something driving us. Giving us a little oomph. I get it. Oomph, oomph, oomph, oomph. Exactly. So, you follow Luka Cent? Yeah, of course. He did an underground show next door to the restaurant last year. It was so loud I could hear it through the walls. Yeah, I was at that show. - And I was serving dosas. - Speaking of. Perhaps we could start with the chutney sampler while we peruse the menu? Yes, right away. We should go record shopping sometime. Maybe you could, uh, score some old-school beats for your playlists. I don't have a record player. I'm a DJ. I have two. Rhea! You know how I feel about this music. Who is that? That is my grandma. Don't you need to change the song? Three, two, one. This happens every night, doesn't it? No. My dad would lose his mind. But it does happen every Sunday night. I love you. I know this is kind of weird. It's legit awesome. Encore! Stop dancing? You may as well ask me to stop breathing. It's not that I don't love your dancing... - But? - It's a little corny. Your daughter always picks such glorious music to play. Who am I not to dance? She does have a good ear. I'll admit, it does help us through the Sunday dinner rush. She's got her mother's ear. Mira always knew exactly the right song for every occasion. Music just flowed through her veins. I need to restock the masalas. Arvind. From the bottom of my heart, I am sorry. But can't I even mention my daughter around you? Of course you can mention her. I miss her too. The last thing Mira would want is for you to hide from the world behind work and your children. It's getting late. Let's get some rest, yeah? Fine. She's got her mother's ear. Music just flowed through her veins. Mom, I can't sleep. Well, I wonder why. It's too loud outside. But if I turn up my radio, it's too loud inside. I see. Or rather, I hear. - Listen. - To what? To everything. What do you mean? Close your eyes. And let the music guide you. The city has so many sounds. There's music everywhere. Can you hear those men outside? They're laughing loudly at their silly jokes. It's sharp… like trumpets. What else? Do another! Oh. The cars that are going over the wobbly grate. Boom-ka-boom. Boom-ka-boom. Boom-ka-boom. Like a big drum. Your turn. Clank-ka-clank. Clank-ka-clank. Like… bells? It's all music. Good night, my darling. Good night, Mom. Um, okay… What? I've never seen you smile like that before. Who is that? That's Max. Transfer student. He and his mom came into the restaurant last night... And you totally like him. Come on, details, details, details! - Spill it! - Okay... - You got me. He's cute. - Yeah! Can we please talk about literally anything else now? Please? Oh, I'm glad you asked. I finished the designs for our Coding Club jackets. And they're gonna be ready for yearbook photos. Yeah, and we're not freshmen anymore. We need to step it up, which was my inspiration for this. Wats, these are amazing. - They're perfect. - Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. We know. - They're so great. The color scheme… - This is the palette we picked. - I love it. - It's so good. Ginger! We're such huge fans. Yeah, uh, can we get a selfie? - Of course! - Thank you so much. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. Thank you so much. The glamorous life of an influencer. What have I told you about the "I" word, guys? - You love it. - You can't get enough of it. It's your favorite. - You're my favorites. - Aw. Walk with me, talk with me. - So, what's new? - Rhea is in love! Hmm? Tell me more! What's their name? Are they cool? Max. And yeah. He is. Oh, he moved here from London, huh? How very… How did you do that? I did not even tell you his last name. I'm that good. I bet he's secret royalty. You could be Princess Rhea! Okay, everyone calm down. Please. He's a DJ. He's probably way too cool for me. Don't sell yourself short. You rock. You make cool playlists all the time. Wh... What is it? Judging from the sheer wall of animal GIFs, I'm going to say it's Debbie from the dance squad - about the promo event tomorrow. - Oh. What promo event? For the Festival of Color. It's Rhea's idea for our homecoming fundraiser. Oh. So, it's inspired by the Hindu holiday Holi. Mm-hmm. - It's about celebrating spring and... - And love. Oh. Yeah. Everybody wears white, and we pelt each other with brightly-colored powder. It's so spectacular, like daytime fireworks. - Wow. - Before that, people need to know about it, so the dance squad is helping me put on a promo event. A UV light dance. This is the site they wanna promote the event with. Oh. Wow. This has everything. Rainbows… - Exactly. - Unicorns… - Of course, rainbow unicorns. - Duh. Yeesh. I… If I didn't know any better, I'd think this was some kind of silent cry for help. Oh. Let me fix that with a noisy cry for help. Watson, help! - Hmm. Let me consult my manager. - Oh. - What do you think? - We could, we could. Two pizzas. Gotta make sure my 10% is worth it. I accept your terms. We'll discuss at lunch. Later! - Bye. - Bye. Settle in, everybody. Okay, time to show me what you've all been working on. Molly and Watson. First, I'm gonna need you to sign this confidentiality agreement. Are you serious? Always. Thank you. Okay. Watson, the floor is yours. Edison had the lightbulb. Steve Jobs had the phone. We have… The Pizza Drone! Whoo! Steady, steady. All right. And we're flying. We're flying... No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait... - Wait, no! No, no! - No, no, no. Cool concept. Execution needs work. And you two are cleaning that up. - Already on it. - Of course. Rhea, please tell me your idea does not involve plummeting pizzas. - Please. No. - Good. But it does involve my dad's restaurant. I have an idea for an analytic app that uses point of sale to track our inventory in real time. - Interesting. - Mm-hmm. But this project was an opportunity for you to have some fun. But this is fun for me. A point-of-sale analytic app is fun for you? Miss Eloi, you haven't heard? All of us kids are into it these days. I promise, I'm enjoying this. And it'll also happen to really help out my dad. Cool. Well, keep at it. And don't forget to tell your folks about the parent-teacher conferences. I can't wait to meet the people who raised you beautiful weirdos. Night, baba. Don't stay up too late. Uh, Dad, come check this out. What are you working on? Something for you, actually. - For me? - Yeah. It's an app to track what people order, so you can keep an eye on ingredients when you're running low. Wow, Rhea. What would I do without you? We're a team, Dad. You and me. You see? This. This is why you're my favorite daughter. Really? I thought it was because I was your only daughter. - That too. - Yeah? Yeah. All right, good night. Good night. I've never considered myself a squid man, but you've converted me. Disaster! Our DJ for the festival promo, the black light dance... Which is happening in 20 minutes... Cheated on their history exam and has been suspended. So please excuse me, I live under this table now. Forward my mail. Okay, okay. Don't panic. Watson and I can help. Can you DJ? Better. We can beatbox. Check it. Stop. Now I have a crisis and a headache. - Ouch. - Ow. Hurt my feelings. - What about Max? - Max? Oh, the dreamy, British boy? With the smashing accent? Real talk. Is Max good, or do you just think he's cute? I haven't actually heard him spin, but he seems to know what he's talking about. Someone have food? I forgot to eat breakfast. I'm a terrible role model. - Cephalopod? - Oh, cephalo-please. They got him. - Who got who? - The dance squad found Max. And they're headed to the gym. Wow, they should work for Scotland Yard. They're very thorough. Rhea, you coming with me to talk to him? Why me? I assume you want the cute boy to know you got him a sick gig. - After you. - Let's go! - Bye. - Bye. - I'm taking this. The whole thing. - Please. Yeah, I want that samosa. You got everything you need, dude? I wish I had all my equipment. It'll be great. It's raw, like when rock bands go unplugged. Debbie, running out of eyeliner is not an emergency. Excuse me. Hey, thank you so much. It's really cool of you to think of me. Don't know how I can repay you. I'll think of something. I can't wait. Okay. Ready or not, it's go time. I think it's starting. Hey, Watson, what's going on? I think we're about to get our world rocked. Hey, Jefferson High! Get hyped for the event of the year, Festival of Color 2021! Whoo! Give it up for our very own DJ Union Max! And if you want more Union Max, I'm proud to announce he'll be spinning at the Festival of Color! I will? So be there! That was very elaborate. Yeah. Only Ginger could turn the gym into a nightclub and get away with it. I'm just glad she's on our side. Imagine if she used her powers for evil. Max, that was some good work on short notice. Thanks. Yeah, that's a little edit I've been working on. Yeah, it sounded like it was a little in-process, which was cool for today. But I'm gonna need my mind blown for Festival of Color. You got me? Yeah, totally. Pizza! I'm buying to celebrate a job done, and a job well done. Rhea, you coming? I'm gonna... No. - She okay? - She's great. Um, I thought your song was really good. DJing looks fun. Yeah, but Ginger's right. I'm gonna need something really special for the Festival of Color. I could help you. I know Ginger's taste. I know what she's looking for. - You would just have to… - Yeah? …teach me how to spin. Really? You wanna be a DJ? I don't know if I'd put it that way. I just want to up my game for my restaurant playlists. Keep it fresh, you know? Keep the guests entertained. Anyways, you asked how you could repay me. That's how. Deal. Do you have any plans Saturday morning? I'm free until my dinner shift. So, it's a date. Victory Vinyl, 11:00 a.m. I will see you then. So, it's a date. And now… welcome to my world. Okay. Where do we start? Where I started. Rock. Oh. Hip-hop. Funk and soul. Now are you ready for your first DJ lesson? Yes. Yeah, we'll see about that. So break all this all down for me. All right. We've got the two turntables and the mixer. And this is the crossfader. You can choose which record the crowd can hear. - Sounds like a mess, doesn't it? - Yeah. - Yeah. All DJs are a bit mad. - Because? Because you've got two different sounds playing in your head at the exact same time, and you just have to somehow make them go together. Okay, grab the headphones. - Oh. Beat-matching. Very important. - Mm-hmm. We are gonna match these two records together. - How? - Aha. See this? This is the pitch control. It can speed up or slow down the record to change the bpm. For example, this track is spinning at… 119 beats per minute. - And this one... - Is faster. Right. 126. So, like a 5.6% increase? You've got a calculator for a brain. That is good to know. I'm a coder. So, yeah. I'm good with numbers. No, that's good. And you might not have been counting beats, but you have had practice finding songs that go together for your playlists. Now check this. This is amazing! I have to try this out for my new dinner rush mix. I didn't know they were doing a clinic today. Oh, my gosh! You're DJ Luka Cent. It's true. What are you doing here? A bit of shopping. Good picks. You showing her the ropes? - Yeah. - Sweet. When you're finished here, come up front for a bit. Okay. Uh, we're done. - Yes, we are. - Yeah. I hope this is good. The first record was so incredible. Hey. Mac, hook 'em up with some flyers. Boom! Check it out. "Battle of the Beatmasters DJ competition." W-What's that? It's a local competition. I do it every year for teen DJs. The winner gets a setup just like mine and a spin session with yours truly. He'll be there. - I mean, I'll try to... - He can't wait. Any advice? Like, what are you looking for? Two things. Tell a story and make us care. That's it. I gotta jet. - Thank you. - All right. - I'll see you later, man. - We'll see you there. We'll just get these. Thanks. I cannot believe we just met the DJ Luka Cent! And he complimented your taste in music. Max, you've gotta enter that competition. Oh, okay. How about we talk about something else besides me and the DJ competition? Okay. Well, how'd you get into all this stuff? Fine. Uh, Mum has to travel a lot for work. So, we move a lot. And it's tough to make friends and meet people when you do that. Being a DJ makes that a lot easier. Like us now, we're friends. Yeah, we are. So, what about you? Uh, what are you into? Do you dance like your grandma or sing? Uh, no. Um, you know, dancing... It's definitely my nani's thing. Singing was actually my mom's thing. She was truly, truly amazing. Was? She died when I was eight. I'm sorry. Yeah. Every weekend, she and my nani would put on a show at the restaurant. She would sing and Nani would dance. They used to have so much fun. Well, Nani still does, as you know. I'll say. She has a shocking amount of dance moves for a grandma. - I'd swear she was Bollywood royalty. - Not quite Bollywood royalty. But every Sunday night, her legions of adoring fans are very there for her Bollywood cosplay. Oh, I'd love to have legions of adoring fans. Maybe one day you will. Would you, um... Do you want to practice at my place tomorrow? Yeah. All right. I'm going to teach you how to scratch. - Okay. - Just the basics. - Okay. - Okay. Now, you wanna find the groove 'cause that's the start of the track. Then, once you hear the track… …backspin. And then you wanna go forward and back. Now, forward, back. Forward, back. Forward, back, okay? Okay. Now you may try. - Okay. Okay, start. - Am I making a mistake? Maybe. - There. Okay. And then… - Good. Backspin. Backspin. Okay. Yeah, good. - Sorry! Oh, my God. Sorry. - Oh, no! You scratched my finest two-dollar record! Please! Please just keep it down until end of business. Oh, no, no, no. Just a noisy neighbor. - Wanna take a break? - No. Let's soldier on. - Crossfader. - Crossfader. Yeah. - Uh, you should try again. - Yeah. It was good, right? Uh... What... What... Where did that come from? - It's good, right? - Where did that come from? No. What? - Max. - Uh, sorry. - Business hours. I forgot. - No! No, no don't. Your pupil is doing all right! Quite good. Uh… Kinda interrupting the flow, Mum. So… Oh, am I? Well, carry on. I've never gotten a "quite good." What? Nothing. How did you know about that track on the other side? We got this record the other day, and you haven't heard it since. I found it online. I wanted to see if there were any hidden gems in what we picked up. That's smart. Good intuition. I haven't even listened to the whole thing yet. Well, there's a really killer track on side B, as it turns out. And you just knew that a slow jazzy jam would work with a house tune? I just kind of felt it. It's really amazing how you're picking all this up, Rhea. It took me a really long time to figure out the basics. Well, you figured them out. And now you're a really great teacher. No. I mean, I think you might really have something here. No, like, you could be great. Like, a real artist. That's really nice of you to say. My mom, my grandmother, even my brother, they got all the artsy genes. Me? I'm a coder. I'm like my dad. We're bottom-line types. That's my Dad. I have to go. What? No! Dad has parent-teacher conferences tonight, so I need to be at the restaurant now. I'll see you later, Max. - You guys need anything? Some refills? - We're good. - Nothing? Great. - We're good. Thank you. Are you moonwalking the samosas? What? You think you and Nani are the only ones with moves in this family? I find it helps to be able to see where you're going when you're serving food. Thanks for the tip. - I'll take it into consideration. - Great. Now, here's a tip for you. Hide. - Where have you been? - Sorry I'm late. You know I needed you here early tonight. So sorry I'm late. It won't happen again. I hope so. Now, should I expect any surprises from your teacher today? I'm a member of a girl squad that rules the school with an iron fist. I would expect nothing less. So, tell me all about this Max. What? How did you even know I was... - I told her. Educated guess. - You're an educated snitch. Out with it. Where did you meet him? School. He was actually at the restaurant the other night. The one with the accent? Yeah. He does have nice eyes. He saw you dancing. He was blown away by your moves. Naturally. You just be careful, beta. The cute ones can be trouble. Don't worry. We're just friends, mostly. He's actually teaching me how to DJ. Like those loud men in the mornings that yell at each other with obscene sound effects on the radio? No! No! Um… DJs just mash other people's songs together. Not exactly. I... I think I understand. I don't. DJs sometimes use other people's songs. And sometimes they make entirely new songs. DJs can be musicians. So, you're a musician. No. No, no, no. It's just a hobby. I was just trying to explain to you how... Of course. Just a hobby. Uh… Whoa. Need a little help here. What is this? It's my food fusion creation. Check out the presentation. Hmm. - Go get changed for work. - Okay. And would it kill the two of you to stand up straight? Yes, ma'am. These are some of the projects that my kids have been working on. Molly and Watson are working on a drone that delivers pizza. - Does it work? - Not at all. Total disaster. But they took a big creative swing, and I love that. Hmm. Uh, let's see. Marcus is designing a dating app for cats, Wishful Whiskers. And Francesca is trying to hack these VR goggles here. Anyway, there's all sorts of games and apps and cat stuff. Lots of cat stuff. And then there's Rhea, who is designing an app for your restaurant. Oh, yes. She showed me. Very clever. Clever. Yes. There is no doubt that your daughter is very smart. She is. Look, Rhea is a wonderful student. She's very focused, very mature for her age. Oh, that's "and now the bad news" kind of pause. No, it isn't. But can I be frank with you? Of course. As you can see from all these... The assignment was supposed to be fun. Well, I'm sure it's fun for Rhea. She's like me. You know, all business. Arvind 2.0. My point is, I'm worried that Rhea is holding herself back from trying something different. It's like she sees the restaurant as her whole life. Are you insinuating that I would force my daughter to do something that she does not want to do? 'Cause I can assure you, I'm not that kind of father. I'm sorry. That's not what I meant. Doughnut branch? - Uh, Miss... - Please, call me Naomi. Miss Naomi. Rhea really likes you. And I can see why. You really do care about her. But I know my daughter. If she had a problem being at our restaurant, she would tell me. She wants to be there. Good. Heaven, right? Pretty tasty. But the closest thing to heaven are the jalebis at my restaurant. - Bold declaration. - Mm-hmm. I guess I'll have to come try it and judge for myself. Hmm. Um, sure, drop by anytime. I'm always there. Great. It's a date. Yeah. Um, sure. Good talk. Thank you. And? How did the parent-teacher conferences go? Good. All of the teachers love Rhea. Everyone thinks she's a genius. Which, of course, she is. So, why don't you look happy? I think I accidentally asked her teacher out on a date. - Accidentally? - Actually, she kind of asked herself. Ah! Boldness is an underappreciated trait in women. Yeah. But I should cancel, right? I mean, I don't want Rhea feeling weird. It's good for children to see their fathers happy. Well, they see me happy. Do they? Do you? Rhea's? Yeah, yeah. Isn't it fantastic? She's getting better with each new playlist. We should definitely play this at the next dinner rush. People might order some more dessert just to stay and listen. Um, I think I should order some more dry fruits. Yeah. - Nice. - Yeah. Rhea! Check out the Festival of Color website. - And it's gorgeous! - It's live. And it's gorgeous because… Because Watson saved my website, my reputation, and probably the world as we know it. Thank you, thank you! But I couldn't have done it without my associate's fierce back-end coding skills. - Oh, stop. - Give me some. But where's the listing for the DJ? You've gotta talk to Max. He gave me a rough mix of his song. - He did? - Mm-hmm. He didn't mention it to me. So, how was it? Eh. What they said. So, what? You're not gonna use him? No, I am. I already announced him to the school cafeteria and the Internet. And that's basically everyone. But I'm just not hype about it. And until I'm hype, I'm not gonna hype him. - Okay. - Can we move that hashtag to over there? - Hey. Uh, what's up? - Why didn't you let me hear the new edit? Yeah. Kitchen. I've been trying to get it together, and Ginger really wanted to hear something, but it's just... It's not good enough. I know. This is one time I would love to disagree with you, Max, but you're right. It isn't. Well, thanks for stopping by. Always a pleasure. Don't be a stranger. What are you doing? You wanna fix this, don't you? You wanna help? Is that cool? Very. So I think we should just take a step back, you know? Like, start with the basics. Like Luka Cent said, what is the story, and why do we care? I... I just want people to feel good, you know? That... Okay. What does that mean to you? Like, what are some things that make you feel good? I guess, a wicked synth pad, a killer bass sound, - a crisp hi-hat pattern. - Even more basic than that, Max. What makes you feel good in... in life? Okay, for me, I'd say my nani's cooking, the color yellow, sunsets... I'm sorry. Uh, how do you make a song out of food and sunsets? My mom said that there is music in everything. We just have to find it. Humor me. Okay, um… The beach. And are there sounds that remind you of the beach? Yeah, yeah. This song always makes me think of surfing. Okay. Great. Let's start there. I always feel good when I skateboard, so… Yeah! Like, the wind in your hair, the rhythm of the wheels. Wait a minute, what about this? This could be the vocal hook. No. - Yeah. Let's go. - Yeah. Okay. Now this, this is definitely starting to feel good. That's what we should call it: "Feelin' Good," you know? Because there's music in all the things that we love. - I like that. - Right? - Oh, no, no, no, no. - What? What's up? I missed the dinner shift. Like, entirely. Okay, okay. Just call them and tell them you spaced! I cannot call my father and tell him I spaced. - But what about the song? - Assuming I am not grounded, we will keep working on this later. Bye, Max. - Dad, I'm sorry and... - Rhea, come here. - Okay, but I just wanted to... - Come here now. I've been having a few conversations with concerned parties recently who believe you might not be happy working here. What? Who? It's not important. But it is the opinion of these people that you're just doing this because you think you have to. You know you don't have to work here, right? You're not super unhappy and you're not telling me about it? No. No, no, Dad, that's not it at all. I just lost track of time. Honestly. I'm glad. Because the next few weeks here are going to be pretty busy. And if you don't wanna be here, I can figure something else out. I'll be here. I've got to be able to count on you, but you've been late twice in these last few weeks. Late twice in five years? Such a shoddy record, I hope a university will still take her. Ashaji, this is between Rhea and me. Are you saying I don't have a say in this family? - What? No, of course not. - Good. Because I did not sign up to be a wise and steady adviser to a family who do not want to listen to what I have to say. Go ahead. Say it. Hey... Mmm. Rhea is a fifteen-year-old girl. She should be out living her life with her friends, not working herself to the bone. - She's not working herself to the bone. - She is far too serious for her age! She is a responsible, hardworking young lady. She is right here! Please just don't fight over me. I lost track of time. I'll be on top of it from now on. I promise, okay? Everyone happy now? That's all I wanted. For everyone to just be happy. Good night. But what about her happiness? Hi. Here you are. Is that good? Okay. Thank you. - You're done with these? - Yeah. Need anything else? Okay, thank you. Oh! Sorry. Hi. Here you go. Did you text Rhea? Yep. Texted. Then I texted her again. Then I texted her again. I'm not really sure how many more unanswered texts I can send her before it's legally considered harassment. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. I just got distracted. Texting while busing can only lead to catastrophe. - I know, I'm sorry. It's… I... - You're lucky your father didn't see you. I know. I'm sorry. It just... - It's okay. I'll clean. You go. - Are you sure? - Go, darling. Go, go, go. - Thank you. What happened? I was texting while busing. So, sue me! I had an idea while you were gone. In the 30 seconds it took me to go to the fridge? - Mm-hmm. - Okay. - This is sick. - Right? I have to go. Well, it's a good thing that the alarm worked. This time you won't be late. I'll see you later, okay? Okay. You can… Yeah, just text me or something. Imagine. An agar vindaloo sphere, perfectly perched… - I'll be back. - …on a single white spoon. Sounds interesting. I knew you'd get it. Miss Eloi! What are you doing here? Oh, hey, Rhea! Your dad invited me. - He did? - Why? Naomi! You're here! You said anytime, right? I did. I did indeed say that, didn't I? Uh, but I can come back if the jalebi isn't ready. Oh, no, no, no. Jalebis are ready. Are you ready for the jalebis? Yeah. Uh… This way. Right this way. Did he just call her by her first name? He's giving her a booth all to herself. What is going on? Something very interesting. Stop spying on your father, both of you, and get back to work. Chet-chet! I'll be right back. There you go. Do you watch all of your customers as they eat? I just wanna be here when you admit they're better than your doughnuts. Okay, but I'll have you know I love my doughnuts. Okay. But? I guess I'll have to tell them I'm seeing other desserts. Please. Did he just giggle? Shh. Let your father live. Hey, are you sure I can't pay something? Don't worry about it. I know the owner. And now, your daughter and I must engage in a bit of girl talk. Of course. Yes. Um, would you help me in back, please? Oh, no, I am very here for the girl talk. Um… Uh, girl talk? I figured it sounds better than "you're in trouble with the teacher" talk. I know. I've missed a bunch of Coding Club. I've just... There's been a lot going on with work and school and things. I can appreciate that you have other responsibilities. But I think Watson and Molly were really counting on you to help them out. I... I did. A drive-by computing does not count. Well, then, maybe they should just start helping themselves for a change. I don't see them offering to help me. - Do you need help? - No! Rhea, are you okay? I'm fine. I'm tired. I'm busy. I just want people to stop asking if I'm okay, okay? How about I ask if there's anything I can do? Unless you can get the rest of my orders out, I don't think so. Right this way, please. Dude, I gotta tell you, straight up, I almost replaced you with my workout playlist. - But this is next-level! - Oh. Thank you so much. Okay. In a few short days, we are going to make epic history. Or, at the very least, a cool, giant mess. Ah! Amazing! I've never seen Ginger have her mind so totally blown. Yeah, well, it was a rough start, but it's been a pretty amazing journey for us to get here. Absolutely. It will be our pleasure. We're happy to help. - Rhea! We got a last-minute booking. - Mm-hmm. It's a big deal. A baby shower lost its venue, and they picked us! - Isn't that amazing? - Wow! Yes, amazing. Today, you can be in charge of the event. Wait, today? You said I could have today off. It's the Festival of Color. - Holi? - Yes. They're basically celebrating Holi. It's for a school fundraiser. Dad, it was my idea. Wow, that sounds amazing, Rhea. But… But? I need you today, baba. I can't do this without you. Fine. What? I'm not the bad guy. What can I do? - Are you kidding? - I wish. It's the worst. I know I promised, but it's not fair. I'll tell you what. I'll swing by the restaurant after, and I'll tell you all about it. Okay. Good luck. Luck? I don't need luck. I've got you. I'll see you later. Rhea, do your job. Sunil, put that there, please. Right there. Perfect. Thank you. Yeah. - Thank you, Nani. - Okay. Thanks, darling. All right, here's your wristband. Have fun. Have a great time. Is that good? Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Hi, ladies. - Here you go. - Oh. Hi, enjoy. Are you enjoying the food? Yeah? Okay. I'll talk to you guys later. Thank you. Yeah. Oh, Rhea. Tell Sully to hurry up with the hot biryani. Behind you, Rhea. We are 45 minutes away, people! We have many excited humans in very white outfits. But they aren't gonna stay that way for long. And we have DJ Union Max, who's gonna drop his astonishing new track! So, come on down! Table five is still waiting on their order. Rohan, how would you like to be cool for once in your entire life? I reject your thesis. I'm fabulous. Fine. How would you like your Tikka-Tacos approved? - Tik-Tacos. - Whatever. Keep talking. Rhea! What's happening with the biryani? We are five minutes out, people! At exactly three o'clock, DJ Union Max is gonna drop his hot new single, and y'all are gonna color bomb each other until it looks like a giant unicorn exploded into rainbows! There you go. Hmm. This better be good. Answer it. Okay. Look. I have been working like a machine at the restaurant and on Max's song, which is why I left you two high and dry. And that is so not cool, and I'm sorry. After today, things are gonna be a lot better. I promise. You know when you get here, we're gonna positively pummel you with that color stuff, right? Mm-hmm. No mercy. I wouldn't have it any other way. Okay, Festival of Color-ers! I just want you to know, with the money we've raised today, we can have the Homecoming Dance on the actual surface of Mars! Or, at the very least, a pretty nice hotel! DJ Union Max, you ready? Let's do this. Five, four, three, two, one! ♪ I feel the I feel the love now ♪ ♪ I feel the love right now, right now ♪ ♪ I feel the love now ♪ ♪ I feel the love right now, right now ♪ ♪ I feel the I feel the love now ♪ DJ Union Max! That was the sickest of the sick! Please tell us the name of your dope new jam, and please say a few words to your giant, new, adoring fan base! Thanks, Ginger. I call this one "Feelin' Good" because there's music in all the things we love. We just have to find it! Well, it was amazing! Everyone go home and stream it a zillion times! It's been an absolute blast! But I have to thank someone, 'cause I couldn't have done this myself. So, word up to Ginger for taking a chance on me. And thanks to all you out there. This is just the beginning! DJ Union Max can't be stopped! There you go. Hey, Max. Rhea, I thought you couldn't make it. Well, I did. Song played great. I can't believe it. Yeah, me either. What? Everything okay? Why didn't you shout me out? Is it because you thought I wasn't here? I just got so excited, seeing the crowd so hyped up. It must've slipped my mind. I can post something later. Max, it slipped your mind? I named the song. I came up with the concept. I even came up with the main vocal hook. I worked with you side by side for hours, and it slipped your mind? All right. I mean, you helped a ton, sure, but just remember, this is my thing, okay? It's my equipment. I'm the DJ, which makes it my song. Are you serious right now? What would you do with it anyway? You said it yourself. You're not an artist. You make mixes for your dad's restaurant. So calm down! We should be celebrating right now! You're right, Max. I did say I wasn't an artist. But you know what else I'm not? I am not someone who would take all the credit for work I did not do. Go ahead, go celebrate your great solo achievement… by yourself. Okay, Rhea… Is that true? What, Rhea? She's just being dramatic. Friends, what does it mean when a man says a woman is being dramatic? He's a filthy liar. Mmm. Facts. Whatever. Let's go. Finally. There you are. Dad, I can explain. I've only ever asked two things from you, Rhea. Responsibility and accountability. Leaving mid-shift when you told me that I could count on you is neither. Dad, I'm sorry... You're grounded. End of story. Rhea! Come here, please. Come. Rhea, talk to your nani. Why was it such an emergency for you to leave the restaurant? So I could show up at the Festival of Color and have my heart ripped out by Max in front of the entire school. And now Dad is so angry he grounded me for two months, which is basically forever. Well, that doesn't sound like a very wise choice. I just... I wanna go back to the restaurant and forget any of this ever happened. Rhea, I love you, but I refuse to let you make the same mistake as your father. What... What mistake? Hiding from life inside the restaurant. There's a whole world outside the Spirit of India. Not for him. After mom, it's the restaurant and us. That's all he has. That, Rhea, is not your problem. It feels like my responsibility though. Because you care. And I know you want to make everybody happy, but believe me, it isn't your responsibility. It really isn't. My words fall on deaf ears with your father, but I believe you can hear me. I just feel so stupid. I've been late to absolutely everything, and I completely let him down just to help Max on that song for the Festival of Color. And he didn't even acknowledge me. Like, at all. So what? You'll make another song. You will make a million songs. You will fill the world with so much music that it will crush him. That's beautiful. And a little terrifying. Yeah. And that sums me up rather well. I loved making that song with Max, but what if I gave him the best ideas I had? What if there's no more music in me? Why in the world are you smiling at that? Because she used to say exactly the same thing. Who? Your mother. Every time she finished a song, she would say, "Well, that's it. That's my last one. The well is dry." She would have a little dark cloud over her head for a few days, and she would make a face like this. But then, like clockwork, a few days later, she would start walking around, humming. And before you knew it, there was another song. Well, I haven't opened this in a very long time. It's amazing. What's this? Oh, that's some of your mama's wedding jewelry. It's so pretty. And all of these were hers? Mm-hmm. The well never went dry. She didn't run out of music, and neither will you. This is for you. For me? You are your father's daughter and your mother's daughter. And your mother always said, "It's all music." So go. Find it. Let it out. Let me guess. You all miss Rhea so much you're moving in with her. You said she can't leave the house. But you didn't say anything about us coming over. It's DJ gear. We just want Rhea to make the most of her enforced social holiday. May we entrez? - Welcome. - Merci. - Hey! - Hi. - Hi. Hi. - There. Wait, what are you guys doing here? Make yourselves at home, I guess? Also, where'd you guys get all this stuff? Please. My dad's a typical Gen Xer. There isn't a hobby he hasn't picked up and then abandoned. We've seen their basement. Yeah. If you ever need to get into canning or ceramics… Holler at your girl. Anyway, all these babies needed were a couple new drive belts, stylus upgrades, a little soldering. Where that wasn't applicable, good old duct tape. The tape of the gods. Okay, let me rephrase the question. Why did you guys bring me all this stuff? Because it's gonna be tough to win that DJ contest without a setup. Contest? What contest? The Luka Cent Beatmasters thing. We entered for you. I'm sorry, you did what? We submitted an edit of one of your dinner-rush mixes. - Mm-hmm. The one that really slaps. - Mmm. What's that? Did you just say, "Thank you, you're all wonderful friends"? Thank you, you're all wonderful friends. I can't enter that contest. I can't even leave my house, you guys. This competition... Would Rhea be playing her music for people? A lot of people. Looks like the event sold out last year in a couple of hours. Pretty impressive. Hmm. Actually, Rhea, we are due a night off. I'll take care of it. - And that's that! - No. No, no, no. That is not that. Absolutely not! What? So you're just gonna let it happen then? Let what happen, Wats? What's up, Max-ers? Come catch me next week at the Battle of the Beatmasters DJ competition. I'm "Feelin' Good" about my chances of winning. Did you hear that? That fool thinks he's gonna win that contest with "Feelin' Good." The song you basically made for him. Is that what he thinks? Well… I think I'm going to need some help… finding some new music. - I'm ready. - Okay. Check this out. Awesome. That's perfect. Thank you, you guys. That's good. I like it. Well, now you need to pick a DJ name. What about DJ Solar Flair? But like F-L-A-I-R, that's important. DJ Algo-rhythm. But, like, do you get it? Rhea. It's me. I don't need a flashy name. The one I have is mine, and it's perfect. Can I put it in all caps? - Of course, Ginger. - Cool. Remember when I was telling you about how great DJ Union Max was? Well, I am thrilled to report that he has some major competition. The new hotness is Rhea, and you can catch her world debut at the Battle of the Beatmasters competition in two days, people! - Hi. - Hi. Wow. You're really into this, huh? Yeah. - What are you working on? - Um, it's just a new mix. It's good. It's very good. Thanks. - Well, don't stay up too late, yeah? - Yeah. Yo, Max-ers, the Battle of the Beatmasters is in two days. Come out and support your boy. Well? How's it going? It's going well, thank you. Wanna listen? - Yeah. - Yeah? My Mira. You brought her back. What are you gonna call it? "It's All Music." - Well, better get ready for tonight. - Yes. Welcome to Spirit of India. - Take care of it, son. - Got it. - This was fantastic. Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you so much. Did you enjoy the butter chicken? I'm so glad. Many congratulations, yeah? Yeah, congratulations. I know I said this was your night off, but this intimate sangeet of close family only... Well, predictably expanded in size. Everybody brought in a plus-ten. I need you both at the restaurant. I'm sorry, Arvind. We're still running errands. - Running errands? - And now we're stuck on the subway. Stuck at what subway? - Who knows? - What am I gonna do without you and Rhea? That's a very good question. It's almost as if you have to prepare for an eventuality where you don't rely on your mother-in-law and your teenage daughter to run your business for you. Besides, you gave us the night off, and as the children say, "No take-backs." - Yeah, but... - What... what's that? You're... You're cutting out. Okay, love you! Bye! Good luck! I'm ready! My darling, you were born ready. Welcome to Battle of the Beatmasters! The competition where we find new talent and let the rookies rock the house! Shout-out to our illustrious panel of judges, led by the extra-lustrious DJ Luka Cent! Thank you. Now, the judges are gonna rate the DJs based on originality and skill, while the Applause Meter will tell us who brought the party! Please enjoy these beats while we get our DJs set backstage. Your mother would be so proud of you. I could really use some of her strength right now. You came this far, didn't you? And that is her spirit shining through you with every song you make. You be the best, truest Rhea you can be. Your heart and your soul, that is what people want to see. Show everybody who you really are. - I love you, Nani. - I love you too, beta. - Hi! - Hi! - Hi! Hi, hi, hi, hi. Hi. - Good luck! Hi. You look amazing. Okay, let's do this. - Bye! - You got this! All right, DJs. Let's spin. We got two rounds for you tonight. Starting with sets from our seven killer young DJs and then we're down to the final two! Look, I know you're still mad at me and I get it. I never meant to offend you... Max, this isn't about you. It's about me, and I'm here to make music. I respect that. And I don't care. Okay, this is the un-chill part. The following DJs will not be moving on. - Ultra Sine. - Ah. Lavender Bear. Ah. And Colossus Creation. Ah. - Thank you, fam. Maybe next year. - Good job. Good job! Four left, but we only have room for two. Surefire Disco, you did good, my dude. DJ Len Cool, it ain't your time. Sorry though. - She's in, she's in. - But y'all know what that means. Give it up for your two finalists, DJ Union Max and Rhea! Yeah, I'm right there. Yeah. Rhea, got a minute to talk to your adoring public? Tell us, what does it feel like to be in the finals? It feels like... Like I was born to do this. - Go, Rhea! - Born to be in the final round of DJ Luka Cent's Battle of the Beatmasters Competition! - One more time! - I made it to the final round! What's this? - Uh… Dad. I can... I can explain. - What's going on? It's... No, Dad. Dad, Dad... Let me... One of these fine young artists will be the next Beatmaster! Ha-ha!
