ACTUALLY, HE HAD THIS GIRLFRIEND WHO HAD A GIRLFRIEND WHO NEEDED A GREEN CARD. THERE'S ABOUT 200 OF THESE TURKISH FISHERMEN STANDING AROUND ON THE DOCK, AND, BECAUSE IT'S A HOLIDAY, THEY WERE FALLING OVER DRUNK, AND I'M WEARING THESE INCREDIBLY HIGH HEELS AND HOLDING THIS MASSIVE CAKE DONE UP IN THE AMERICAN FLAG. SANDRA, WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING SOUNDS LIKE A WONDERFUL SCENE FOR JERRY, WHO'S A PRETTY GOOD WRITER. I TELL YOU, BY THE TIME I'D FINISHED RUNNING THAT GAUNTLET, I LOOKED LIKE I'D BEEN CAKE WRESTLING. ( laughing ) VOLA, IS MY FUTURE HUSBAND ALWAYS LIKE THIS? I MEAN, HE CAN BEHAVE NORMALLY, RIGHT? NO, NOT REALLY, ESPECIALLY WHEN BENNY HAS MADE A HOUSE CALL. WHICH HE HASN'T BECAUSE I DON'T ASSOCIATE WITH BENNY ANYMORE. YOU'VE MADE THAT CLEAR, AND I UNDERSTOOD IT. - ASK JERRY. - WHO'S BENNY? Vola: HE'S A PREPUBESCENT DRUG DEALER. WHAT'S THIS, HEIDEGGER?

SHE HAD THE BOOK, AND I SAID THAT YOU WERE IN IT. I'M NOT EMBARRASSED ABOUT THAT. I'M PROUD OF THAT. I'M NOT GONNA BACK OFF FROM THAT. YOU WON AN AWARD FOR THAT. HE WON AN AWARD. HE'S A GOOD WRITER. YOU KNOW, JERRY, MAYBE YOU SHOULD COME DOWN AND MEET CRAIG. YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR NEW WRITERS. OH, ON "MR. MUNCHMAN"? - "MR. CHOMPERS," ACTUALLY, - RIGHT. AND WE REALLY DO TRY TO PUSH THE FORM, STRANGE AS IT MAY SOUND. WELL, I'M SURE MY "HUSTLER" CREDENTIALS WILL JUST SLIP ME RIGHT IN THE DOOR THERE. SO, WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE? ARE WE TRYING TO PLAN A WEDDING, OR WHAT? WHEN YOU WANT TO DO THIS? - WHAT ABOUT NOW? - NOW? - YEAH. - RIGHT NOW? THERE'S AN ALL-NIGHT CHAPEL DOWN ON EL DORADO. IT'D BE PRETTY COOL. THAT'S RIGHT. THERE IS. SHOULD WE DO THAT? JERRY, TODAY IS A GOOD DAY TO DIE. Woman: HOW MUCH DID SHE PAY YOU? - WHAT? - TO GET MARRIED. 30,000. - THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. - MM-HMM. DID YOU LOVE HER? OCCASIONALLY. DID SHE LOVE YOU? HMM... I THINK SHE SAW US AS THIS POTENTIAL HOLLYWOOD POWER COUPLE IN THE MAKING, WHICH IS KIND OF LIKE LOVE. Woman: "MR. CHOMPERS." PLEASE HOLD. SO, DO YOU FEEL DIFFERENT BEING MARRIED? YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO KEEP IT PROFESSIONAL IN HERE, OK? OH, OK. SORRY I'M LATE, BUT I WAS ACTUALLY DOING THE ONE PART OF THIS JOB THAT I ENJOY. I WAS MEETING WITH A GROUP OF LIBRARIANS WHO WANT ME TO DEVELOP A MR. CHOMPERS LITERACY PROGRAM. THIS FELLA TESTS HIGHER THAN BARNEY. I'M AMAZED. IT'S REALLY QUITE FANTASTIC, JERRY. IT'S LIKE CRAIG HAS DISCOVERED - SOME KIND OF UNTAPPED MYTH. - HMM. JERRY, SANDRA SHOWED ME SOME OF YOUR FICTION AND YOUR AWARDS, AND I HAVE TO SAY, POWERFUL STUFF, ALMOST TOO POWERFUL. I'M WONDERING IF YOUR MIND CAN FUNCTION DOWN ON OUR LEVEL. WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE OUR LITTLE FRIEND HERE? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I'M SURE YOU HAVE SOME IDEAS FOR OUR LOVEABLE PUPPET. I'D SAY FUCK THE LOVEABLE PUPPET. THIS GUY IS A WEB-TOED METAPHOR FOR THE AMERICAN DREAM GONE BAD. I SEE MR. CHOMPERS AS A MODERN-DAY TOM JOAD. Woman: SHE'S IN A MEETING RIGHT NOW. CAN I TAKE A MESSAGE? I GREW UP IN PACIFIC GROVE. I HUNG OUT ON CANNERY ROW. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN THERE, SANDRA? NO, I DON'T THINK SO. I STARTED READING... WHAT'S HIS NAME? - STEINBECK. - STEINBECK WHEN I WAS NINE. - I LIKE THIS. - THE LITTLE GUY. THE LITTLE GUY, EVERYMAN, THE TRAMP. I LIKE THIS. THE DEFENDER OF THE COMMON MAN. GANDHI. IT'S GOING TOO FAR. THIS COULD SERIOUSLY RESHAPE THE SECOND-SEASON BIBLE, SANDRA. HERE'S A PIECE OF SHIT, JERRY. I WROTE IT AND REWROTE IT, BUT IT AIN'T WORKING. IF YOU CAN MAKE THAT WORK, YOU'RE ON, OKAY? OKAY. SANDRA, GET ME A COPY OF "GRAPES OF WRATH." JERRY, GOOD MEETING YOU. Jerry: SO, NOW I GOT TO REWRITE CRAIG'S PIECE OF SHIT, AND I'M SLEEPING ON NICKY'S COUCH. Woman: WERE YOU GETTING HIGH? MAINTENANCE, YOU KNOW? ENOUGH POT TO BLIND AN OX. AND WHATEVER ELSE WAS LAYING AROUND. ( telephone ringing) HELLO? MOM... MOM, THIS ISN'T THE BANK. THIS IS JERRY IN CALIFORNIA. YOU CALLED ME, MOM. OK. ALL RIGHT. FINE, MOM. ARE YOU OK? MOM, ARE YOU OK? OK. MOM? I REALLY MEAN THIS. I HAVE TO GO. I HOPE YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY. GOOD-BYE, MOM. MOM, GOOD-BYE. Man: SUICIDE IS ONE OF THE GREAT MYSTERIES OF OUR TIME. WHEN WARREN STAHL TOOK HIS OWN LIFE, HE TOOK A PART OF US WITH HIM. Woman: GOD, BABY, THAT'S AT SUCH A FORMATIVE AGE. Man: OH, A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE WASTE. I MEAN, HE ACHIEVED SO MUCH. OH, GOD! HE HATES ME. I AM STEEL. STEEL FEELS NOTHING. ( Sobbing ) WHY, WARREN? Why did you leave me with them? They hate me. We don't hate you, Mom. Correct me if I'm wrong, Brad, But isn't it illegal to name a cat Warren in this state? ( laughing ) I want to go, too. ( laughter and applause ) ( switches TV off ) SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK? IT'S REALLY WEIRD. I WROTE THAT, LIKE, 10 DAYS AGO. I THINK YOU SHOULD BE REALLY PROUD. HMM, "PROUD" ISN'T THE FIRST WORD THAT COMES TO MIND. YOU KNOW, I THINK I'VE HAD A CRUSH ON YOU SINCE THE FIRST TIME I MET YOU. Woman: DOESN'T SOUND LIKE SHE WAS TOO BAD. Jerry: SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL, SHE WAS WITTY, AND SHE HAD NO IDEA WHO I REALLY WAS. DID YOU KNOW WHO SHE REALLY WAS? I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. - WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - HANG ON. ARE YOU OK? Woman: DON'T TELL ME. NOT THE MEDICINE CABINET. Jerry: OH, YEAH. BY THEN, I WAS A PRO. YOU KNOW THE OLD COUGH-AND-FLUSH TECHNIQUE? ( coughs ) COUGH WHEN YOU OPEN, FLUSH WHEN YOU SHUT IT. Sandra: JERRY, ARE YOU OK? YEAH. I'M FINE. Jerry: WORKS PRETTY GOOD UNLESS YOU FORGET TO PUT BACK THE DRUGS. THEN YOU HAVE TO FLUSH TWICE AND PLEAD BAD PLUMBING. ( toilet flushes ) YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST EPISODES WE'VE HAD THIS SERIES. REALLY? HOO, THAT'S KIND OF A SCARY THOUGHT. DO YOU WANT TO STAY THE NIGHT? NO. I DON'T THINK SO. I'M GONNA HEAD HOME. IT'S GETTING KIND OF LATE, AND I GOT TO GET UP TOMORROW, ALL THAT... STUFF. JERRY, I'VE HAD AN IDEA. YOU HAVEN'T FOUND ANYWHERE TO LIVE YET, HAVE YOU? UH, NO. NOT REALLY TOO GOOD AT LOOKING FOR PLACES. I'M MUCH BETTER MOVING OUT. WELL, I WAS JUST THINKING THAT, YOU KNOW, IT COULD REALLY HELP MY GREEN CARD SITUATION IF WE LIVED UNDER THE SAME ROOF. YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT THIS SPARE BEDROOM THAT I NEVER GO INTO WHICH YOU COULD WORK IN UNDISTURBED ALL DAY, AS I'D BE AT WORK. OBVIOUSLY, I DON'T MEAN "MOVING IN" MOVING IN. RIGHT. THE ONLY THING IS, THERE'S ACTUALLY THIS GUY WHO I HAVE KIND OF GONE DOWN THE ROAD WITH ON A PLACE, AND I FEEL LIKE I'D BE KIND OF LEAVING HIM IN THE LURCH IF I JUST... YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? THANKS. BYE. JERRY... YEAH. I CAN'T... I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO TALK ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW. I'M, LIKE, STILL SPINNING FROM THAT, AND IT WAS... I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE YET, OK? THAT'S WHERE I'M AT, SO... BUT I'M JUST GONNA... I'M GONNA LET MYSELF OUT, ALL RIGHT? YOU DIDN'T HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE? Jerry: I DIDN'T HAVE A WALLET, AND I WAS MAKING FIVE GRAND A WEEK.

'CAUSE I GOT A WARRANT ON MY ASS! Woman, over radio: At 4 a. m. Stand up for you rights. Man, over radio: Right here on your personal radio station, K. Y. T. A. Energy is the source. Nothing happens without energy. And the more of it you have, the more of your personal potential you're gonna tap into. But see, energy's like the gas that drives the car in traffic. You don't want to run out of emotional gas when you're climbing the hill of success. Otherwise, you'll find yourself coasting back downhill. And that's what happens to a lot of people. How many of you, for example, could remember a day when you woke up feeling really tired and lethargic? How many can remember a day like that? For some of you, it was recent. Now, when you wake up feeling really tired... Not usually the first thought, is it? First thought, where is the coffee? Oh, my God, not another Monday. You know, when I came here to New York, I got an education. I first started coming here about two years ago. I remember about my third trip in, I came on a Wednesday, you know, mid-week, and I'm sitting in the back of the car here, right, and I turn on the stereo... comes on, he goes, all right, out there, ladies and gentlemen, we made it! It's hump day! ( audience laughs ) You know what hump day is? Wednesday. Yeah. Some people look at Wednesday as hump day... ( baby crying ) Can you imagine if large numbers of people spend five days out of every seven looking forward to only two of them? Some people live for two days out of every seven. Can you imagine living that way? Having such a boring, disgusting life you look forward to two out of seven? See, the bottom line is, My Monday is better than most people's Christmases 'cause I've learned how to communicate with myself... ( radio continues indistinctly ) ( siren sounds ) CHRIST. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU CHANGED THE BABY? WELL, YOU KNOW HOW IT IS, OFFICER... KIDS... I WAS JUST ON MY WAY RIGHT NOW TO GET A DIAPER. CAN I SEE SOME LICENSE AND REGISTRATION? KEEP IT DOWN. WAKE THE KID. GET OUT OF THE CAR, DUMB SHIT. COME ON. WHY DON'T YOU GIVE SOCIAL SERVICES A CALL. WE GOT A BABY TO PICK UP. STEP TO THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE, PLEASE. COME ON, WATCH YOUR HEAD.

Kitty: JERRY, I DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE. ANOTHER OF OUR FAMOUS GOOD-BYES, SO I DIDN'T TELL YOU THAT MY FLIGHT WAS THIS MORNING. I'M NOT MUCH GOOD AT THESE THINGS, SO I'LL JUST STOP. NO, I CAN GO ON A LITTLE MORE, I GUESS. I WILL MISS YOU. AND EVEN THOUGH I KNOW YOU'LL NEVER SHOW UP IN ANCHORAGE, I'LL ENTERTAIN THE NOTION NOW AND THEN. SEE YOU LATER. Man, over radio: During the 1980s, Jerry Stahl was a successful television writer making $5,000 a week. At the same time, he also had a $6,000 a week heroin and cocaine habit. His dark and funny book is called "Permanent Midnight." It's a raw account of the depths of his habit and how he was able to claw his way out. When you got to Hollywood and you're working on these series that I mentioned, These were big series. What kind of a double life must you have lead? Because you had to at some level perform as a writer. Well, Tom, the beauty of Hollywood is that everybody's so self-obsessed, they don't really notice what anybody else is doing. So basically, they come filing in in the morning with their cappuccinos and croissants, and I'd come bouncing in with my heroin and syringes, and pretty much lock myself in the office and get really pleasant for about an hour and a half. Let's peel away a few more layers here with Jerry. Tell us the story as I kind of teased into this segment about the birth of your, uh... of your child. Well, Maury... Jerry: PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK. WHAT'S THE WORST THING HEROIN DROVE YOU TO DO. I ALWAYS ANSWER SHOWING UP ON MAURY. But that's what you do when you're a junky. Your number one job is to shoot junk. I'm sure Damian will concur with me on this. I agree with Jerry that the damage is irre... reprepable. Jerry: THAT'S THE TROUBLE WITH SURVIVING. AT THE END OF THE DAY, ROLLING INTO A PTA POTLUCK DINNER. OR PAYING THE GAS BILL CAN BE MORE TERRIFYING. THAN THE WORST 3:00 A. M. NARCOTIC HELL. Yep, wow. BUT WHAT DO I KNOW? I GOT OUT WITH A BAD LIVER AND ENOUGH DEBT. TO KEEP ME IN HOCK TILL I'M 90... IF I'M STILL HERE. Jerry Stahl, junkie. We'll be right back.
