We have online Anna from Soccavo How are you, Anna? I'm good, and you? As I promised yesterday, I have tracked down 'Mum where are you?' who would you like to dedicate this song to this morning? First of all, I dedicate it to my mother Today is her 75th birthday! Congratulation! May she live for other one hundred years, and best wishes from the entire editorial staff of 'Radio Secondigliano City'. And then I want to dedicate it to mrs. Rita Guadlagione, Whom mother, a good soul, left us just around this time a year ago. My late condolences to Ms. Rita Gualdascione. Then I dedicate it to mrs. Carmela de Liguori, to her husband -the accountant, Alfonso, To aunt Antoinette, Peppino, Immaculate, and to the little Deborah. Then I dedicate it to the family Giannantonio to the full, namely: His grandfather Gaetano, to grandmother Amalia, uncle Ciro and aunt Teresa, parents Charles and Dolores Anastasio, and to the young Victor, Adelaide, Babies and last-born Raffella. Then a big hug to all the condo in via Minturno 14, and more precisely: To Sir Ottavio Improta with his wife Catherine, sister-in-law Teresa and small Annarita, Luigi and Simona. Then again the lady... Are you from Milan? Yes, I am from Milan. Doctor, you you will not believe it, but I when I come to pick up a customer at the airport I guess from where they come from. For example, I say: This is from Turin! And he's really from Turin. You might say: what's the trick? I don't know! it is a gift! Doctor, is the the first time that you come to Naples? Yes, this is the first time. Eh, a pity that there is such traffic, because Naples is a beautiful city the cars makes the city a mess. Naples, doctor, is a romantic city, rich of poetry. You know Salvatore di Giacomo? The greatest poet of naples. How beautiful it is, it is my passion, doctor! Piano in the night playing distantly and the music is heard in the air GET OUT OF THE WAY! It is 1 Am, and the alley sleeps on a lullaby On a motif DON'TO YOU SEE THE INDICATOR!? YOU BLOODY CUNT God, how many stars in the sky! What a moon! And the nice air I wished to listen a beautiful voice singing. but lonely and slow dies the antique motif ONE MORE TIME...! GET OUT OF THE WAY! Good morning, doctor, would you want a watch imitation? This is a beautiful Rolex, you see, doctor? - Instead, to his for a lady, very elegant... - No thanks, I don't need watches A sportive one for summer? look, a beautiful Porsche, doctor, is fabulous! This one is earthquake-proof. This means that if there is an earthquake you die and the watch survives. You want to see? This, look at how beautiful it is, take a look. Have you seen? It still Works, doctor! The situation is serious. doctor, according to me, this is a traffic jam knot. What do you mean, 'a knot'? Doctor, it is impossible to advance when each car passes, another car pass by half a meter. Then there is another one that passes this other, another one, and another... in short, what happens is such a mess of cars here, you see, that if you do not get a traffic police to untie the knot we can stay here as well until midnight. Doctor, listen to me, here, the traffic police won't arrive. Mo' (=now) I do a something very useful: we go up on the sidewalk... you see? Ah nice, eh? here you go, you see? Ah, I stopped the meter and we go to take a nice coffee! But why there are no traffic controllers? Doctor, the town is big, the traffic police are few, and they do what they can. But, excuse me, but... but did you not see all traffic that is there out there? Don't even tell me about it! Two coffees with sugar! - For me no sugar, thank you. - Do You have a little bit of diabetes, eh? No, but I like it without sugar. I understand, you want it sugar free because you don't want to gain weight. But you are not fat. It is true, Concettina, is this sir fat? But what fat, so what should I say I about mysefl? Am I suppose to starve? You're not fat, you are normal. You hear me, doctor, you are not 'sicco' (=lean) or 'chiatto' (=fat), you are a man adjust, sturdy. I understand it, I am a tailor, look at mo' (=now) I'll see the truth. You will need a good size 48, Extra large. And do you know how you will look like? Lean as a fish! Eat, eat! Diets are bad! Your problem is that you need to lose weight a little here and a little here. This is all about. Have you seen, doctor? I've said it to you, din't I? You are not fat, you're skinny! Please, can I have a coffee with no sugar? Give it to me. The doctor is from Milan, is the first time that you are in Naples, do it happy. Doctor, sorry, but you seemed to be a known face. Or perhaps you are the new account of the Alfasud? No, I'm not an accountant, I am the head of the staff! Fuck, the chief of staff of the Alfasud... - Concettina, please, let me go - You know, the accountant... Doctor, by pure chance, I have here the resume of my cousin Panetta Luigi. This is her picture, this is the bachelor certificate. - This is a certificate... - My brother has made the application two years ago... (they all speak at the same time) Doctor, but you have become crazy? If you start to say in front of everyone that you are the new director of the staff of the Alfasud! At risk of being killed! By the way, doctor, I have relative of mine, a good guy. And' expert electrician, six years that he fails to find a job. The mother is desperate! Excuse me, are you the gatekeeper? (a mother calls out son) Make the sign of the cross! Excuse me. Are you the gatekeeper? It depends. Depends on what, excuse me? From what you need. My name is Cazzaniga, I would like the keys to my apartment. Dr. Cazzaniga, the new tenant? A pleasure, I am don Armando. Sorry if I said 'it depends', but here we are three gatekeepers: Myself, don Ferdinand -the substitute gatekeeper- and Salvatore, the deputy of the substitute gatekeeper. Not to mention... Garibaldi. Yes, the parrot. - He knows the names of all the tenants in the building. - Bellavista! Have you heard it? Bellavista is a tenant of the building. I'm responsible bit of trades, rents, while Don Ferdinand, Since that is always seated, is responsible in a bit of communications, messages, do you understand? Salvatore, instead, is in charge of the stairs, and to the relations with the outside world. Here it is! Don Armando, everything in place, I paid for everything. I give you first the change. Two thousand... and four hundred lire. A crowd as well! I'm all sweaty! The bills... water, gas... and these are the seeds of the sunflower for Garibaldi. - okay, put it there. - Yes, okay. - And here is the new tenant, dr. Cazzaniga. - Pleasure, Salvatore. Take the bag, and walk him to the fourth floor. I give you the keys... you have the keys? - No... yes... yes! - Here they are - there's The keys! - Accompanies the doctor, go! doctor, in reality, in this building, the gatekeepers are three-in-one: Don Armando, he was never the gatekeeper. He accepted the position only to have a house with a window overlooking the sea. did you see the window? You will see... Ferdinando, on the other hand is always sitting, never stands up. The professor said... Doctor! The professor said that " don Ferdinando it is a mythological creature that is formed for half a person, and half of the chair. To human knowledge, no one has ever seen him on foot. But in short, this lift is or not working? No, doctor, that is broken. Doctor, this is the third floor. The first, is the second. There lives in Bellavista. You know? you need to meet him. An exceptional man, doctor. Professor of philosophy, however, now he is retired. When he speaks ... doctor! He is like the supreme court! And he is married, with mrs. Marino. A beautiful woman... but difficult! Doctor, difficult character! And they have a daughter: Patrizia. female, her as well. In reality, Patrizia real name would be Aspasia. Aspasia, the woman of Pericles, An old professor of Latin. I certain things say, but you already know that. Patrizia didn't like the name Aspasia, so she decided to call herself Patrizia. The professor, he is the owner of the apartment in which he lives. He also has lands. In Nocera. However (inferoriore) The Lower part. Yes he has them, but it's as if he didn't have them. In this times, with all that is happing, can the professor go to Nocera and says: "Farmers! These lands are mine!" ? No! And hence, at most, he manages to 'take' a couple of pounds of tomatoes a year. Eh, Rachelina, the bottles, you need to dry them. But you want to understand that if there is water inside, the 'pummarola' (=tomato) ferment and bottle bursts? Lady, I rinsed well, but it's the dryer that does not work it anymore. We are drying bottles from this morning. A minute. Eh, a little, to make the bottles of tomatoes in the house, it takes time and patience. Those who do not have patience, the bottles cannot do. look at me, you see? I wrap it in the newspaper, gently, and then lie down slowly into the cold water, and I'm careful not to touch the one with the other. For example, I am convinced that the paper from magazine is not good. No No No, because it is thin, but it's tough. The lady Carraduro, who had the subscription to Grace, when did the bottles of tomato sauce, put a little 'Grace', and a bit 'Il Mattino'(newspaper). And well, you will not believe it, but with 'Grace', the bottles burst, with 'Il mattino' no. What a thing! I don't understand why in this house we don't buy canned tomatoes as do all civilized people. Because they are tomatoes that we have not met in person. why don't you come and give a hand to your mother? Dad, blessed are you that you have nothing to do. And you have to do? Here, you see? So they end up the conversations with my daughter. With a question mark. Professor, those are kids, they are practical. To tell the truth, I would do less than do all this work... - Professor, us in we are ready - they all came in? Really miss Xavier, he now has his turn. Fara, half an hour later. Eu', young man! The street sweeper! You in the morning, you have to come at 07:00. Because the lords of this palace are a mass of 'bastards' (=lousy). Throw all the crap from the top to the bottom, the garbage goes into fermentation, and we die from the stench. And now little by little. Do you plan and not 'arronzate' (=do a job badly done). The zest (=peel) there... there, There... you see? The rind of the melon. Eh, there... bravo, bravo! And now, a little more forward. Eh, later, there are those cards 'inzepate' (=wet). Eh... that is the stuff of the lady on the third floor. SHe says that she is noble, it is the countess, and that can't cook because they ruin their hands, and then they buy the 'panzerotti' and the 'rice balls', and throw all of the papers adown. the countess. But I do not understand, but it takes time to put the garbage in the bags? Ah, is not this, is that people are born dirty of constitution. She Is born 'bastards'! (=lousy) young man, and what are you doing? Eh, you go too fast! Here you must sweep slowly, meter by meter! And you do that, you can go? And there is all the trash in the ground! No, No, don't worry, lady, I'll come back in half-an-hour and put the wax. Rachelina! This is the second! We want to break all of them? Lady, that was not me, the bottle slid out. And' slipped... you can always find an excuse! By the way, your father will not wake up even with a noise so loud? No, No. My father sleeps by the 21th January 1972. From the day of the bankruptcy. He wakes only when he hears talk about money. - And what happened on the 21st of January 1972? - Eh, it was a black day. The poor man, he needed some money, made the rounds of all the friends but no one wanted to help. Eh, you, now see him like this, nailed over a chair, but you can't even imagine what could make the man when he was young. He had the seven spirits, came out from within the fire. He has done a thousand trades, but... it was always unlucky. Marina, but what kind of bad luck you keep talking about? The one -your father - has always been a 'head glorious' (=had a lot of imagination). You haven't forgotten that time he wanted to open a cinema inside the train station? A cinema inside the station? But that's it, sorry! He wanted it for travellers waiting for their trains which departed always late. Then came Mussolini, He put the times of the trains right, and he went bankrupt. Then open a barber shop, and went out the electric razors. Then he opened a laboratory in which to repair the calligraphy pens, and they invented the biro pens, which were used and then thrown away. Eh... in short, every thing that man did, there was another who invented another thing to make him fail, here it is. Then... on the 21st of January -in fact - 1972, to find this amount of money to build a lighter that would change our lives for good... no one wanted to give him a lira. He looked for three days and three nights. And now, you see, he wakes only when he hears talk about money. And how much he needed...? A million. 'A million...' 'o soul do purgatory!' I do not understand, what did he say? - A million. Oh, the soul of the purgatory! - Ah... Guys, this is the good, and this is the evil. The good is doubt. When you meet a person who has doubts, rest assured, it means that he is a good person. It means that he is democratic, that he is tolerant. When you meet these here the ones who have the certainty, the unwavering faith, then, be careful. You are to be afraid, because remember what I say to you: Faith is violence, the faith in any thing is always violence. People, however, People are divided into men of love and men of freedom, depending on if they prefer to live hugged one another, or prefer to live alone, to not be 'annoyed'. - Professor, I am a man of love. - Bravo! As there are men of love and men of freedom, then there are the people of love and people of freedom. on this map of Europe, I painted in black the peoples of love and white those of freedom. Italy, Spain, Ireland, Poland, Greece, belong to the world of love. England, Scandinavia, Germany, however, belong to the world of freedom. Then there are the grays, which are the ones that have a little bit of love and a little bit of freedom. The british, people of freedom, have the cult of privacy. In Italy, the british, are the people from milan, which are here Professor, speaking of the milanese, it came the tenant of the fourth floor. I have been told by don Armando that he must be the director of the Alfasud. With all due respect, he is called Cazzaniga . Mo' (=now) I say: you have also a daughter, young lady and you don't change your surname? can you imagine this poor girl that goes somewhere, with other people and says: "Pleasure, I am Cazzaniga" Must be Saverio. Saverio, come quickly! - he professor has already started? - Yes, yes. the old woman was just unbearable. As she dies, out of spite I'll make the alley super clean! - let's Go, move quickly. - Professor! You can keep the Sir, he can't stay in the kitchen, we need space. men of love, instead, do not need space. If It was for them, they would live always embraced with one another. Professor, allow me a thought in verse: We are angels with one wing only and we can fly only by staying embraced - Nice, eh? - How are you doing this? - I do Not know. - Good Morning. - Anyway, I said to you... good morning how to recognize if a man is or is not a man of freedom? very simple: the man of freedom prefer the christmas tree, the man of love, instead, he prefers the crib (presepe). The youth of today, I'm sorry to say, prefer the christmas tree. My daughter, for example, she it is not 'presepista', she is for the tree,'alberista'. Patrizia, Patrizia, listen, come here. Dad, I'm in a hurry, I have an appointment with Giorgio. And who is him? However, men of the freedom they love to take showers, the men of love, instead, prefer to be the bathtub . Professor, then there are those that do not, nor the bathroom, nor the shower. The shower is from Milan, because you wash better, uses less water, and lose less time. The bath, meanwhile, is Neapolitan. It is an encounter with the thoughts, an appointment with imagination. Watch: in this point here, a million people... 'Nu million... or soul do purgatory!' - three thousand lire. - three thousand lire? Eh, three thousand lire. Wanted to bite the camera! Good evening. - scotch tape. - Thanks. A bit of music? Anna Oxa? The Police? A nice Pino Daniele? I have 'think of me' by Julio Iglesias. No, No, thanks, give me the change. Madonna, always the same! The tires? Deodorant? No, No, thank you. - breath Mints for the breath? - No, the breath is okay. Are two thousand lire. three... four... ...and five. - would you like a coffee? - Two Look here, them to me by right. If one is wrong, it loses all privacy. - The coffee. - What do you want? - Nothing, I'm giving the cups. The by your sisters, the cups! Please, please! Look here: the new directional centre of Naples, designed by a japanese architect. If I knew before, instead of graduating high school, in Naples, I was going to do it in Tokyo. - what are you thinking? - Giorgio, today 'is not good'. - 'is Not good'? And you tell me now? After that I paved the car as a kiosk? Giorgio, we need to talk about your future. 5 years ago you got a degree, and you're still unemployed. I understand now. As you rightly say that it is a shame to be unemployed at the age of thirty, and better to talk about it, without being seen by anyone. And already, and we for this we have put the newspaper, no? I have heard that the Olivetti Pozzuoli has to hire graduates. And okay, if the Olivetti really wants me to, I did a an application with stamp duties, they will take it into consideration. Giorgio, you continue to joke. Patrizia, if you must know, I am doing this for five years. And I did: 135 applications to recruitment agency, 46 examination psycho-technical, and I have sent more than one hundred letters of recommendation. And now, if you allow me, I am annoyed. I have no intention of asking anything to anyone. It means that I ll live with the 10,000 lire a day that passes me by my father. You say so because you don't know what happened. What happened? Patrizia is pregnant. - And who was that? - Giorgio. - Ah, now I understand who is Giorgio, you see? And you, how long do you know? From the last week. - And now you tell me, sorry? And when I would tell it? If you're always with those five. My friends in this fact have nothing to do. Ah, friends, a street sweeper, a crap gatekeeper and a couple of other lazies. Instead, this is Giorgio doing? Eh, he is the architect. But... now he is without a job. Unemployed? Eh, unemployed. - Ah, then, goodnight, eh? - Good Night. Giorgio you know him well? yes, he's a good guy. As soon as they are ready with the papers, he marries her. But how is going to marry her? But how he is going to marry her? He has Not a penny, not a job, not a home... "He is going to marry her!" - Shhh, shut up. Look, Gennaro: they are young people, are not philosophers, eh? They love the child they want, with the help of god will also find... money, work and home. Don Armando, what's this outfit? have you seen, I also have the hat. But who made you dress that way? It was Cazzaniga. He said that those who enter the palace must know who is the gatekeeper. This Cazzaniga... But he also put don Armando with the uniform? No, don Armando refused. He said that he is not the gatekeeper, He is only consultant. Saverio, this is a civilization: the discount is an act of love of the seller to the buyer. In a country truly civilised, the discount should be mandatory, and different from person to person, you know? My uncle asked for a discount, even at the Rinascente (a mall). And not at la Rinascente in Naples, at la Rinascente in Milan! Professor, how is that possible, everyone knows that there are fixed prices. Well, he had to buy a toaster: he went, took the appliance if you watched him, if he turned, he saw the price and then asked the young lady: Excuse me, miss. This toaster would cost 32.000 lire, now -who asks is never wrong - Could I pay him the 30,000 round figure? I'm sorry sir, but, at the Rinascente there are only fixed prices. Yes, I know, but for once, I say, you could make an exception. Look at that, everyone knows that, at the Rinascente, prices are fixed. - Come on lady, can you do me a favour? - Tell me. Can you call the head of the department? Listen, it is perfectly useless to call the head of the department, will confirm what I have already said. Eh, you never know, we try to Me calls it a the moment? Listen sir, our employee has just explained, it seems to me that... the company can not do discounts. Excuse me lady, I called you, not for the discount, but because I wanted a suggestion. - Tell me You should know that this toaster at home already I have it, only that it is broken. This morning I wanted to make myself a toast cheese and ham, I put the plug... -pff - it broke. Fortunately, I saved the ham! Now to fix it they asked me for 20.000 lire. put yourself in my shoes: it is better for me to fix the toaster, or for me to buy a new one? However, if you at this point, can make a small discount, then we cut to the chase. I don't think about it any more, and I buy the toaster again! Do as you wish sir, but we can not do discounts. But I am also a friend of the lady Rinascente. There is no lady Rinascente. There is, exists, only that you don' not know! Professor, but in the end the discount to him was applied? - No. - Ah, no? And then what he got from all this? Nothing, he got nothing, it was only to be recognised. In fact, every time he went to the department store Rinascente, they called him: the friend of the lady Rinascente. - Professor nice, to you I was waiting for! - my Lady... - Giggino, today 'is not the case'. - Professor, I-I am what I have to say. - I know this thing I have to say. - Giggino, I, the coffin, not me, I want to buy. Here. Professor, I was counting on your intelligence, but I see that you have not understood anything. If I offer you the purchase of a coffin in installments, is for you to make a deal. Over all, you are at the back of the chapel, otherwise I would not have been allowed. Professor, sorry if I'm intruding. But you know that you're a nice guy? But you realize that with the speeches that you make, you also bring a little bit of a bad omen! The ignorance has spoken! The coffin with instalments good luck! Colonel De Vizzis he bought one when he was 70 years old, and he is not dead. Perhaps he is not going to die. Yesterday I saw a funeral of his nephew. The nephew is dead, and he is not! Here it is. Giggino, I would not buying clothes now that I am alive, imagine if I buy a coffin when I am still alive. - Behold, bravo! Professor, but you did not understand that I want to give it away! - I want to give away! - And yes, I do this: You paid me 60 instalments of 20,000 lire. Behold, I come to your house and you paid me one installment, you may not notice even. Oh, listen, sorry, not that I care, because I so much to die there I think, but all of this, how much would it cost? 1.200.000 lire, keys in hand. As if it was a car, practically. There is convenience, there is the convenience. First of all, by buying in installments, you can choose the wood. - just Tell me: yes or no. - No. - you Want the walnut burl? - No. Giggino you from walnut. You want the presser foot to the paw of a lion? - No. And Giggino from the leg to the paw of a lion. I have to do the courtesy, look at the wonder of this catalog. Look, eh. - This is Cleopatra. - And this, who is it? - Antonio. - And who is Antonio? - Antonio, the lover of Cleopatra. - This and Aeneas. - This! - ...is Aeneas - Aeneas is the man! -' man. - And why, professor? - And here is Dido, on the case. - In the case. - Bin in the cashier. - Look at the wonder! - No, Dido! - I understand 'bin in the cash'. Look, this is a niche, look at that magnificence! I'm so in love, I made put 8 next to the chest of drawers. Moreover, this material is indestructible, is the stuff from Germany. When your relatives raise the coffin, they know that what they hold in their hands! Giggino, I... you can say what you want, I the coffin is not me, I want to take. Professor, you look at this journal, look, look! Argentario in flames. Sardinia: destroyed a thousand hectares of forest. - well? - The fire destroys the wood, the wood disappears from the face of the earth. Giggino, now I am annoyed. Giggino, it's late . - take care. - 'Be good' (you are good). Professor, you will end up in the plastic! You will spend eternity in Moplen! Don Armando, but how is that success? How did it happen? When Passalacqua have bought a parrot, Garibaldi is no longer him. According to me he is in love. This is the third time that escapes. Really, this parrot has become an animal! - Lady, but you have seen where you ran? - And' finished up there, I saw it! Here it is, up there! Don Ferdinand, you saw coming out of the parrot from the palace? Colonel, with all that I have to do, I have to watch the parrots? Professor, he escaped another time, Garibaldi. Obviously it is a bird of freedom. Not want to stay with Don Armando. Professor, allow me a thought poetry for the occasion: freedom, freedom well, the parrot needs to try. And this is. professor, meanwhile, Cazzaniga has made another complaint to the administrator to prohibit the presence of animals in the palace. - Eh, but what can you do? But which precise, he is just sick. My wife Rachelina, who works as lady of service from them, she said... Hhe gets up at 6:30 on the dot, to be on time at 8:30 in Pomigliano d'arco. Now I say: you are the director? But what kind of director you are, then if at 8:30 you're in the office? Salavatore 'The person it sad as his name' Cazzaniga! Professor, have you seen this? There haven't even looked at us That is strange people. My wife Rachelina said... My wife said, that thiis people when they eat, not watch even the television! - But is it broken, the elevator? - Yes, yes, it's broken! How do you understand when one is 'stoic', and when one is 'epicurean'? It is a simple thing: the stoic, like the great objectives beyond the life, and for these goals they are willing to die. - We are not willing to die! Christians are stoics. And yes, because christians, what they want? They want eternal happiness. And as christians say? - We are born to suffer. - We do not want to suffer! The marxists are the stoic, because they want justice for all, and for this righteousness they are willing to endure: the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the revolution, that, said between us, things that are awful. Cazzaniga is stoic: Gets up at 6:30 in the morning because he wants to become the general director of Alfa Romeo. He is not like us, we are the epicureans: we are satisfied with little, as long as this little it is given as soon as possible. On the other hand, why sacrifice for the posterity? What did these descendants do for us? Then I say with the word of poet Horace: Quam minimum gullible postero (trusting as little as possible in tomorrow) - well done! What happened? To - Nothing. - nothing? The crib... The whiteboard... All of the books on the ground! Noo, these are not books. They Are the dividing walls. So said the architect. This is the apartment of the bride and groom. Get away from there that that is the corner of the studio, and now I have to clean. The corner studio? Yes, because he told the architect that the apartment is done around corners. Where are you now is the studio area. This is the corner of the living room. The corner bed now, don't you see, no? Oh, the dining corner is not there, because he said the architect will come to eat at your place. Ah, this I imagined! And tell me another thing, Rachelina, and all the books in my to-earth, would that make us? I have told you before: the architect will build all partitions, tall a meter and a half. So when one is sitting, does not see anything. When it is raised, they sees everything. As long as there are I in this house, the architect does not see anything. You put in place everything as it was before. He's right mrs. Cazzaniga when she says that you do not understand the young! That you are part of Naples that was! And now I have to put thing in order, eh. Listen Gennaro, you have to look reality in the face. Your daughter is pregnant 3 months and they are not married yet. George does not work, in one way or another we have to arrange things. And they should live in my study? Or my lady, Gennaro, but you want to remember, or not that you're retired? A study!! What do you have to study! Pass me the salt. But do you realize how many things I have in there, so important? Look, Gennaro: if we discourage him, the boy gets hopeless and does not marry her anymore. And then, what the hell, it means that for the moment, for your meetings you go to the terrace. Here it is. Mary, I agree this is an emergency, What I can't stand is that in this house everything is decided in my absence. Okay: so since you are here, you can decide to sell that land in Nocera Inferiore, because the bride and groom have to pay to buy a store, and they need twenty million. Twenty million... Or soul do priatorio! Twenty million? It is a joke to make twenty million. You just have to play 5,000 lire on the lottery, and we win 21 million. There are also the money for the cigarettes. - Salvatore, but where he lives Don Gaetano? - On the roundabout. - Practically, he lives in the midst of the boats. - Is he a fisherman? No, it's a guy hit by the earthquake who made a "villa" on the sea. Can we enter? Who is it? Lady, sorry, Don Gaetano is in the house? We have come for the 'mystery'. Wait a moment: Ciro, go call grandpa,' that there is a customer who is waiting for him. - Sit down in the living room, please. - Yes. Patrizia, have a seat. - I sit here? - Eh, here. Taralli, taralli, beautiful. Salvatore, but what is the 'mystery'? The 'mystery'... the 'mystery', Patrizia... The 'mystery' is a kind of story, where there are many things, and every thing is a number. And we how many numbers we have to play? And well, then here lies the art, the science. Modestly I will be there that I know the things that matter and those that don't count. You need to know that Don Gaetano, when he was young, was scarred by a 'guappo' (=criminal) that with the force wanted the numbers. From that moment on, every time that he says the 'mystery', when he say an important thing, without wanting to, He touches the wound. Salvatore, Giorgio is right to refuses to come. The wound... you tap, don't tap... If he really did know how the numbers, he would play them himself. Patrizia, pay attention to the wound! Don Gaetano, dearest, how are you? The tomatoes grow, and the donkey is tired, the top of the climb. - Is entering a trance. - And that's okay. It was the feast of our lady, and all the saints and wanted to bring a gift. Santa Lucia has brought forty sausages, San Rocco, a bottle of sparkling wine. St. Paschal, and St. Anthony they wanted to buy a nice bulb, because the Lady complained that she had electrocuted all of the bulbs, and in the evening could not read. When all of a sudden, arrive St. John, and then Saint Anthony's turn and after you have taken under the arm San Pasquale says: "Paschal, we see, St. John is a bit envious" "If you feel that we have taken a light bulb for the lady, you know that?" "If you take them all, and we do make a figure of shit!" Shit: is 71. Really, I said "poop". Always 71. - Then, if I'm not mistaken, there are the Carabinieri (police). - So it seems to me. They make 36. They Were two, and they were on horseback. They were on horseback? And now you've let them out, these your horses? The mounted police make 20. You have told me the police without horse, that make 36. What do we do now, we have 20 and 36, we want to play both? We will have police on foot and two mounted police? - You have to have patience. The dream is not mine. - it is Not yours? - No, it is my sister. I always play, but don't dream ever, and then when I want to play, I go by my sister in the evening, and I say: "Carmelina, make a beautiful dream, so I play tomorrow, 5,000 lire". OK, ladies, but you have to be accurate. Here there are a lot of carabinieri, take a look here: There are police in Africa, which are 57 The police arrested, the police with the trumpet. They play the trumpet, these police? Carmelina, had they the trumpet? - Huh? - The trumpet? - No, were not trumpeters. They were in uniform? As they were dressed, these police? Carmelina, with the clothes like these police? - Had they the plume? - Huh? - plume, red and blue? - Nooo, they had pens! The pens? Then were the bersaglieri, were not the police! And those are 85! - Carmelina! Carmelina! - Eeeh, but what you want from me? But then these were really soldiers? Yes, they were soldiers on horseback. There are no bersaglieri riding horses! - And this is a dream! - But get out! Then, Patrizia, let's recap everything. The wound was touched four times. When he named st. Anthony, St. Paschal, St. John, and the light bulb. - so we have to play the quadruplet. - Then you don't understand anything! Sant Antonio and San Pasquale were arm-in-arm and then just make only the sum. 13 and 17 do 30, and the terno and the beautiful that played. We play: 30: two saints under one arm. 24: San Giovanni. and 79: the light bulb. - Really good. - Good mozzarella, eh? Attention! Attention, gentlemen. Look at me good in the face. Do you remember me? No, because here there is a fake waiter, that how to put money on the table to pay the bill comes, he takes the money, he puts them in his pocket and leaves. It comes out like a bolt of lightning. From behind that tree there. it means that we will ask for your documents. Sir, you joke. He is a devil. He comes here to take the money. He might also give you the tax receipt. The money, you have to give only to me, is that clear? Otherwise you pay twice the bill. Good appetite. Do you understand? You never stop learning. To look well... you have a face like a nordic. But, were you born in Naples? And as no? Are a true neapolitan. - Son of the neapolitan? - Yes, as far as I know, all of my were born in Naples. - On the other hand, you last name take Loffredo? - Yes. And Loffredo is a typical surname of the lombards. In 915, after christ, Marozia had a son out of wedlock by Ugo of Provence, to which he gave the name, in fact Loffreddo, giving rise then to the families of the Loffredo and Laffredo. Later in 927, Marozia... Eh, Gennaro, listen, stop this 'lesson' and speak of the facts. Giorgio wanted to say something, if you want to talk about... No, nothing, I just wanted to say that... On Thursday I and Patrizia, we're getting married. Ah, you say that like this? Between a shrimp and a mullet? And... as I should I say this? Maybe... I have the wrong scope? No, is that me you communicated as one that says: "on Thursday we're going to make a pizza". I understand that the situation worsened, but there is a way, no? But you realize that today you live with the remote in your hand? And you still have you to think about the appearances? Ok, I am not thinking of appearances, however, since Giorgio does not have a secure income, I believe that here we do not speak much... No offense, Giorgio does not have a secure income, no? And so the more that speak of the past I believe that it is better to talk about the future. I can say one thing as well? George's uncle finally decided to sell the store. He says that it does not pretend even... what is it called? -The full selling price. Bravo, selling price he just wants everything the profit, they share in half Am for this only today I have done live. Until yesterday I felt like I was a specimen of the poorest of the world: one of the unemployed graduate of southern, and of good family. In other words, the title of the study prevents me from making a beggar. For inadequate preparation of the family I do not know how to pickpocket, and I'm not even able to dress as a waiter to steal the money out to a restaurant. Giorgio, it seems to me that you have already given too many explanations. Evidently my father did not appreciate your sincerity. However, these is our business. I should marry you, and I am happy to do so, not because I'm pregnant, but because I love you, and I esteem thee. Okay,' va', let's make a toast to the bride and groom. Miss, mister, attention please! (Lady, ladies, attention, please) Look me, look me! (Look at me, look at me) Remember? (Remember?) Saverio, look, I'm sorry and no offense, but you are in fact of foreign policy, do not understand anything of it. Here, he spoke to Cavour. Salvatore! Salvatore, here the problem is one only, is simple: you are the the with Russian, and I am with american. - This is everything, understand? - And that's it? Salvatore, but you know what? America has never lost a war! And who it wants to do to lose this war to America? Then, among other things, to us, who lose or win, we don't care. Our real problem instead is that there to find the way to have less discomfort in the case of the outbreak of a war. - well, yes, it is clear. - And this is why... - Speak less loudly. And it is for this reason that we must form an alliance with Russia! - Ah, to lose. - Not to loose, follow me: Listen: A war breaks out: - we are prisoners. - Ah, the two of us, sure We do not have the constitution to be prisoners of war in Russia! - In Russia it is cold, there is frost... Siberia - Siberia... You eat a little! Put the case, instead, that we are prisoners in America. But America is a different nation! - New York - New York - And Washington? - Washington - Washington... The climate is more temperate, and eat well. And if the Madonna of Piedigrotta blesses us, we can even find a beautiful job! - You say, eh? - Yes... Then you know that in America they have invented a game similar to our lottery? Do you know how to call it? Bingo. Bingo... Bingo! Salvatore, you're obsessed, you know, with lottery I knew that you made to lose 5,000 lire to the little poor of Patrizia. - I had her to lose? - I! - Saverio, if we have lost the terno (triple), That has really been just a little! - To the soul of the fool, Saverio! You have the hard head, you have hard head! - But when Don Gaetano has made someone to win a lira ? - Often, often. If you were, as I said, I, you the by 'Perverted Monk' - I knew It! - It is clear! - Because the Perverted is an exact science, just remember that! - Yes? Because he touches the customer, and depending where he touched them, you know the numbers that you had to play, that is all, understood? And according to you, I had to bring the daughter of Bellavista to be touched by Perverted Monk! - She was in need - You are crazy? And then I repeat that if we lost the terno was really for my own human error! - Human? - Human. And I emphasize the word human, boy! The numbers Don Gaetano gave was accurate: 79, the light bulb, was a winning number. 24, San Giovanni, as well. And then? - It failed that shitty 30! - see It? -, Instead of 30, 48 was a winner. - And you said nothing! When I went to protest by Don Gaetano, you know what he told me, eh? Who hath said unto thee? He said to me... "Asshole!" - To me? - You weren't there. - Ah, of course He said to me: "Asshole! Sant Antonio and San Pasquale by the arm, do 48, not 30! - And why? Why? Why is Saint Anthony, who is 13, before going arm-in-arm with St. Paschal, who is 17, he turned, it is okay, thus, 13 became 31, 31 + 17 = 48 - And I have made myself a fool!!!! - You! - And you weren't there. - Ah, of course, I was not there. ...I would have killed him! - But what happened? - Oh, look at that crowd - let's see - let's see, go - Excuseme - Excuseme - Sorry, you know what happened? - if I knew what happened I was not here to lose my time. No, I know, we just wanted to know what was going on, that's true Salvatore? - Yes, yes. And I, too, want to know what was going on, now there so we all know. - Excuseme - There we go - it wasn't me! - But there is no need to push this way? - Sorry, you know what happened? - it Seems that it happened a robbery. No, they did not listen to that, those who are in the middle do not know anything. - At this point, if we want to know the truth we must go to the epicenter - Bravo! - Permission! It is not possible, it's a Jungle! Do you remember the film 'asphalt Jungle'? It's the same!the same! The guards are not there, they show up it only to make tickets, then they disappear. The state is absent! The state is absent! It is not possible! A respectable person, when they go out in the morning, you know, to have a little, a little bit of security should come out with the gun here, like Tom Mix. You remember Tom Mix? - Doctor, I'm sorry, but what happened? - That is what happened: therefore, I have a niece that is called Geppino, the son of a sister, separate, she was unfortunate with her husband. This morning was the 'birth to his' (=his birthday), I told to him: "Geppino, nice kid, do you want a gift for your birthday?" He said: "I Want a horse," he says, however, pointing it out: "I want it red" I almost as if I had had a premonition, I said: "But Geppino, nice kid, but red must be the horse?" "Only red" You have to believe me, I walked the whole market, the whole Ward Market, there is not a Red horse! Not lies, so rare that when I saw one, look, you seen it, this is the last horse that they do in Naples. - besides this one they have to order them from Japan. - Noo - Yes! So was so much the emotion that I I stopped the car, and... I was so agitated that, I left it open. I have to admit... And you leave the car open, with all these thieves around? No, but I, but I left it open for a minute, because I kept an eye on the horse and an eye to the car. In fact, I saw this young criminal, who entered into the car. Then when... I understood the danger, no? I put the lady a side, is it true? Eh, aside, you have thrown me in the air! If it wasn't for this young man who held me, I was going to fell badly It was really like that, it was. If I was not there to catch her, she was felling badly. Okay, so, I have removed the lady, and ran to the car. I jumped inside the car, I caught him from the thighs, this young criminal, no? And I pulled, and he pulled. Do you remember the snake? It was like the snake. At a certain moment he escaped from my hands, and maybe that was the Madonna of the Carmine, because, look, if I caught him, with these same hands, look, today I would have killed him! No, I would have killed him! I would have killed. Sorry, but what happened? What happened? So, I have a nephew, today is his birthday, is the son of my sister separated from her husband, She was unlucky, no? Then this morning I said: "Geppino, nice kid, what do you want for your birthday?" He says: "I Want a horse". So much so that I when I heard this thing on the horse, I was moved, because in this cruel world, in this world of infamous that even the creatures (=the children) want to these games -as you call it?- erotic games, games... you call it: 'War games', War Games, and even... the One thing he wanted to? This soul so... A horse! I was very moved, you must believe me, I was moved. Therefore, Listen to me well, eh? The price of the statues, varies depending on the height and quality of the work. A Saint Anthony Abbot, with a beautiful face it costs more than a Sant'antonio Abate, with a less successful face. Like, for example? Little one, that is St. Anthony of Padua, NOT St. Anthony the Abbot! Sant'antonio Abate, has the pig, got it? Oh my, but how time does not go to church, eh? Guys, you want to the basic things you need to learn. Here are the customers, you can't know nothing. Maybe they are asking a St. Joseph the worker, and you delivered a Archangel Gabriel with the armpits open? Eh? - Don Arturo, Good Morning! - Good Morning. - I need eight San Gennaro. - you want Them in half figure? -, then dad pays. - Wait a moment. Here's the thing. And 1, 2, and 3... Guys, you have to be careful in all occurrences, is that clear? On the 13th of June you need Sant Antonio. Ah, Christmas baby Jesus and the whole holy family sell good. However, do not overdo it with the supply: maybe, you make a big order to get a discount, and then there are all the San Gennaro on the stomach (unsold), clear? - Please, give my regards to dad, eh? - Thanks very much, goodbye. - You're okay. - is it clear? - Uncle Arturo, but you also sell 24 hours (luggage)? Patrizia, but which 24 hours, my daughter! This is a 'set' for the masses in the open air. Do you understand? Oh! Here you can have the box for the anointing of the sick. For example, this is an article that goes much as a gift, because it costs little, and makes a good gift. Don Arturo, good morning. Here there is Vincenzino. It was long time no see, eh? You thought something happened? No, no, not really. Don Arturo, put me a little bit of ham in the middle of the bread. A slice only? At least two. Don Arturo, you are always a friend. - good-bye to ye! - Be well. - But who is? - They Are the new poor. And they are here often? Eh, once a month, a maximum of two. But this is not the problem. You are young, you are strong, and I feel the need to rest. What can I do? Let's say that I have not the physical suitable to stay in the commerce. And now, I greet you. and i offer you my best wishes. Be well Giorgio. - Bye, Patrizietta. - Thanks. Greetings, my children. Best wishes. - good morning, architect, miss. - good morning, good morning. - But that you have brought? - Today is your first day. and donna Maria has sent you to the lunch. By the smell the first would seem to be pasta and peas, because you like to. The second one I don't know. Even you, here is the wine, you send the professor Bellavista in person. - Thanks very much. This is for you. - See here. - See, finally, a security service we want. But what protection? This is the camorra which has sent the first warning. Sorry, here it is written: Enough with the crime! The security service of the merchants is at your disposal. Saturday, at noon, a member of our staff will come. Receive him with courtesy. This is the camorra. Five times they have stolen the radio, you would not believe it. Insurances they hate me. You know what police told me "But you, why you care so much to hear the radio?" Here, the state: absent! Because those that take them and send them out to do the house arrest in their villas of Sorrento. But in Sorrento, I would go there too! If you did like the Ayatollah: The true democracy. This, is true democracy! Sorry, but what happened? What happened? So, today is the birthday of my nephew Geppino, who is the son of my sister separate. At a certain moment I said: "Geppino, what do you want for your birthday?" He says: "A horse, a red horse" Now, the red house are very difficult to find here in Naples. So, when, after having travelled all over the market, I saw the red horse, unfortunately, I left the car open... - Eh, you leave the car open, and you complain of all these mariuoli (=criminals) who are out there? No, but I was with an eye to the horse and an eye on the car, so much so that I saw this young thug who came in, and I threw myself to look for... I took the lady, I have put her aside, is that true lady, you remember? Eh, put aside... you me you threw me into to the air, if it were not for this young fellow so cute and kind that he held me, I would be falling very badly. That's right, it was just a matter of inches, I grabbed her. Okay you saved her... in Short, I entered in the car, I caught him for by the thigh, this criminal, no? and I did not let go, and he pulled it from the other side, and I was pulling here, at a certain moment... You know like a snake? He get out of hand, really... It was, perhaps, was the Madonna of the Carmine, because if I was, I had him under my hands, I swear to god on my nephew Geppino. Look, I am a respectable person, yet with these hands... I would have killed him! No, No, No, I would have killed him! Yes, yes! doctor, in the accident before, in your machine the guy has lost the necklace of gold, it is a memory of his mother. If with your permission, if he can go to take that. Go Ciccino, go to recover that, the doctor here 'is our thing'. I gave you the salt. The electricity is running. The detergent I put in it. The handle of the pan that will bother you I moved. The tap water I open. The programme of your mother I put in it. What the fuck do you miss? And tell me you do not want to work! I want to see who's tougher, you or me! WELL' JETTA' OR SANG! (=you throw the blood) You're right that you're heavy and I can throw you from the balcony! Damn the dishwasher and to the one who has invented you! People say there you'll be fine, they have all the appliances. Here they are, appliances! Rachelina, the professor, where is he? Out. Rachelina, tomorrow you have to go to the store with Patrizia, you have to sprinkle the saints, there are kilos of dust. I can't, I go with the lady Cazaniga. You go nowhere! You do what I say, and if I told you tomorrow you go to Patrizia's shop, you tomorrow go to Patrizia's store. Yes? And I'm going to the event instead. Which event? - Tomorrow, there is the women parade. - And what you have in common with these women? When there is the march of the maids, you shall go, too. mrs. Cazzaniga is right, you are practical. What? Practical. And what does that mean? It means that you are practical, but you're also arrogant. Always say: do it! Do it! Do it! Now I have to do everything myself? According to me, mrs. Cazzaniga is breaking you. Be careful! Yes, it's good. Sir, sorry, will I have to move you and I have to dry beneath you. Salvatore! Salvatore! The old man is cold! We noticed at seven in the evening, but who knows the poor guy when he was dead. But as have you noticed? Was the dishwasher. The dishwasher? - water Leaked. - Your father lost water? My father lost water? No, sir. The dishwasher was leaking water. I've always said that to that stupid of Rachelina: "You have to look at the filter" When it becomes clogged the filter, it breaks down the dishwasher. Eh, poor guy. But how old was he? Two years. We bought it at Duchesca. But there has always been trouble. Saturday is tomorrow. What do I do? It is written above, what you must do, you see? "Receive him with courtesy" With courtesy In short, I have to suffer? Eh, for the moment, yes. Not to suffer you would need a more efficient state, do you understand? But Giorgio, I must say, our state is not up to it And then you do one thing: you instead of calling it 'bribe', you call it 'tax' and you pay. As if it were another state. Yes, a state of barbarians, do you understand? An invading army out of the sewers. Professor! I am here. Giggino, I did call because, as you can see, we need your help. Professor, professor, damn your head! I said to myself: "take the deal! Get the convenience!", and you nothing! You Have called me when things are done. Now the old man must do whit what we have in stock. Giggino, but what do you you think the old man cares, where does it go? This I tell you! But no one knows if the person concerned, from the other world, see, and judge the relatives. Tomorrow you die, go to paradise, and the first person you meet is the old man, which says to you: NEE! in which coffin did you put me? Okay Giggino, pull out the catalog, what should we do? One thing, you could do: instead of a single coffin, you buy a set of two coffins. One to use immediately, and the other for you from here to one is the moment. By purchasing wholesale, you can have a discount of 30 to 35 percent, and you save a million! He really died. - what time... - Patrizia, the holy peace of God! - But what happened? - And you come to me behind the shoulders! Just today, that I'm like an electric battery. - How do you feel? - A little tired. - And sit down, what are you doing on your feet? - The doctor said that I have to walk. - Yes, but in the open air, not inside a store. That you want to go crazy? Giorgio, I'm a bit worried about this fact of the Camorra. You, however, when this one comes, do not to lose the calm. I? I'm quite calm. Then, if we have to pay, we pay, what we have to do? The person that you were waiting it is me. First thing, don't shout, because I have the pacemaker and I can die from one moment to another. I am simply a collector, if you want to pay, you pay. If you do not want to pay, do not pay. To me it does not matter absolutely nothing. The only thing that I say to you, but, please, is to keep calm. The doctor said that I can not stand the slightest emotion. Then if you don't believe us, be silent for a moment, and listen. And the doctor has told you to do a job more honest? And such a beautiful lady you are! This is the only job I found! This is the only use that I have found in my life, Santa Lucia is my witness. I would miss the sight if I tell a lie. Believe me, believe me, is a life of heartbeats. This is ugly people. But we, how much should we pay? This is a flat tax. Come, I show you Sit. Here's the thing. Via Duomo, 200 000 lira for the shop, you see? I ll be collecting every months. And okay, what should we do? It means that this morning we sold two San Giuseppe, and today, we lost 200,000 lire. No, nothing at all. For the moment, we cannot pay not even a penny. We have just opened and we don't have the money. Eh, but these, however, though already know this, so they sent me. Your uncle already had the ultimatum, that is why has escaped. And well, what can I say does that mean... I will put in a good word. I will say that you are young and will have a week extension, okay? But if we do not pay, then, what happens to us? This is not I can tell you, because the doctor has forbidden me to be present when he begins the escalation. Okay, then goodbye, see you in a week, so many beautiful things. Oh, by the way, I forgot. Here's the thing. This now is another question. Here if you want to buy, buy, and if you don't want to buy don't buy because there's nothing going on. This is my second work that I do, when I go around, you see? As you can see, all stuff of first quality: american lighters, watches with the movement, and again, seven jewels, and auto-refresh that takes advantage of the movement of the arm. But what is it? Tonight no Channel 4? And no, because Cazzaniga made us move the antenna. This Cazzaniga... And why it made us move the antenna? Because it says that the thread passed in front of the window, and when there was too much wind it was very pleasant. Go figure... In this building we have always been in the peace of the angels. Now comes the Cazzaniga, and there we cannot even see a bit of television! Dear viewers of Tele Mergellina, to present the show that follows there are no words. Do you remember the drummer Parascandolo, the one that accompany him in his tour in Puglia, Campania and Basilicata and the famous singer Gennaro Savastano? Guess who we have the honor and the pleasure to have tonight here in the studio? The brother of Parascandolo! A round of applause for the brother of Parascandolo! Tell us, what is it to be the brother of Parascandolo? But you, in life, what do you do? I sell potatoes, watermelons,... the fruit, the new potatoes. Sell a bit of everything, what I find, that I do. New Onions, oranges, ???, the mandarins, to the grass. My oh my, this can't be watched. - Hello love. - Hello. - How did it go? - Eh, in short. -, Then? - Professor, another invader came. Now the states have become three. the other camorra called, saying thattomorrow the will come in in the shop. What do I do? I pay taxes to all three? No, you must pay to us only. Now I will explain: The shops of via Duomo n. 157, belong to a family. Those after the 157 belong to us. You have the 157 bis? Then you are the debtor only in the us. Yes, I do not doubt what you are telling me, but, the fact, however, that the day before yesterday came a... I don't know how to say, a debt collector. We know that. He was 'the heart of the ungrateful', the one with the peacemaker. He is a bad one. He was not supposed to come, this is not his area. Therefore, you have to pay only us, otherwise someone in the family... may get hurt. In the sense that he dies? There might be an incident. Listen, since you are so kind, may I ask you a personal question? Please go ahead. But were you born in Naples? Yes, why? In Naples Naples, or in the province? No, the center of Naples. I was born in 'Neighbourhoods'. - From foreign parents? - No, from Neapolitan parents? But why I am suffering this interrogation? Because it seems strange to me, that a neapolitan, a man of love, he can be so ruthless against another person, by threaten them of death only for the sake of money. Professor, but then where do you live? Naples is no longer what it once was, here there are 200.000 unemployed persons dying of hunger. Listen, to me this thing the unemployed and die of hunger, never convinced me. At the time my, people were not counting how many unemployed, but how many employed there were. A quicker calculation. I do not accept such excuses. I know many unemployed people who get by, yes, but they do not go killing people. And this is a people without courage. And you are brave: A night you put a bomb under a gate, and you feel the heroes. Maybe on the floor above there is a poor old man who sleeps, that dies, but to you it does not matter, you are unemployed. You have the moral alibi. You are a neapolitan, and you kill Naples. because there are traders who fail, industries are closing, the youth who are forced to emigrate... Oh, and then I wanted to say another thing: But all in all, it is not that you live a shitty life? Why, I think: Jesus, yes, you do the billion, earn, however, you kill each other And then even when you are not killed, there are revenges: You kill the mothers, the sisters, the children. But have you done the math? Is it convenient? Listen professor, I don't know if I'm wrong but according to me it is all the fault of the drug - May be - And as such cannot be? Salvatore, you have no idea, I the morning when I clean, the syringes that I find in the midst of the garbage, Professor. Imagine that I at the beginning I did not realize, and then I thought: "But how many people are sick here in Naples?" And instead then after I got it. Professor, professor! Are the youth of today, Salvatore, the young people of today who uses the syringes of marijuana, you understood? It is incredible. To me, once, a painter, when I was small, he wanted to drugging. It was the first time that I went to do cleaning services . He wanted me to eat the cocaine. I said to him: "give it to your sister, the cocaine!" I immediately realized that was a thing that makes you feel bad., Because this painter, the more cocaine he took, the more painted crap. Professor, allow me a thought poetry for the occasion: my drug is within the heart, cocaine mine is called: Love! - And this is. - Bravo, bravo! - how are you doing? Carmelina, do me a favour, come down to the grocery store. buy ten bags of chamomile tea and a packet of bicarbonate of soda, half a kilo. Ten sachets of chamomile tea and a packet of bicarbonate of soda, half a kilo. - But you have never tasted the drug? - No, are you joking? I don't eat the peppers, in the evening, because I won't digest them, imagine with the drugs. But however, certain it is, professor, that here, according to me, the phenomenon is worrying. Professor, I knew that near FrattaMaggiore, there is a priest who has an open... a local, in short, a school for druggies, here. They say that there they take them, care for them, give them to eat, and then they also get them a job. - It is good - and How good it is! I went there to talk about Carmine, my brother, you know, he is unemployed. The priest said: "No, he must be a real addicted, he must have the holes on the arms, if not we don't want him." I also said, to Carmine: "Thrown yourself on the floor, do something..." We have also make some reharshal at home, at home, but he can't, because... he is a good boy, you understand? It is not his thing. professor, among other things, you know another thing? Do you know how much a gram of cocaine? - 2.000 lire? - Eh, 2,000 lire! - 200,000 lire! - Eh, Salvatore! - Eh, Saverio: 200.000 thousand lire! - A gram! - A gram, colonel, and always tends to the increase! Now, I say: Colonel, see if my wife is coming. - a Colonel, my wife! - No. Where I live, in my block, the Bridges Red, you know what I mean? Professor, there is a woman, too beautiful, too beautiful! Natasha! SHe has blond hair! With 10,000 lire, Natasha gives you a full service, above and below. Now, given that Natasha has two breasts like this, I would like to ask these young modern, two points: - Eh, asshole! - To me? - no, sir, they (the young) - Ah. But with 200,000 lire, it is better that you pay for a gram of cocaine, or you make a full subscription to Natasha? Hello? Yes, yes, Saverio is here. Now he comes.. - Saverio, Giorgio. - This is for the fact of my cousin, the professor. Ready? Yes, good morning, architect, tell me. For me, when you want. Yes, even tomorrow, it should be fine. Be without any thoughts, it is my thing. It goes very well. Goodbye, architect. Nothing, professor. Because I have a cousin who is in the photography field -, and he is a friend of a lawyer of the camorra. Then I want to see a little if I can solve the fact of the 157 bis, understand? At 101 years, died peacefully Gaetano Esposito - And I wanted to see if he made stories too! Please. Have a seat. You have to do the photos? For ID? No? Then we do four poses, each one different from the other. a moment, because before you sat down, a gentleman, he was short, so you have to lower the seat. That's it, have a seat. And no, and no, you do not go too close, if not your noose looks like a pepper , and it seems like carnival day. No, your lire 1,000 are not good. They Are not good, the machine is sensitive. With these here we don't have problems. These one my wife, each morning, she press them. Put, put! Then we do the math, put! Have you put them? And now give yourself a nice worsted. Have you combed? Give me, give me. Here's the fact. Now for the program: if you want my advice, the first two poses. I would do them with a serious expression, like a clerk for card, a passport, documents in general, that can always be useful. The other two, you can be a bit more artistical, for beauty contests, auditions, for a wives, girlfriends, lovers. Do you have a lover? No? SO you can get one, you can get one. When you are ready, say "Ready", and I press the appropriate button. Ready? - Ready. - Ready! Action: make serious 1. Via! Were very well, do not move, very very well Face serious 2. Via! Now change! Smile, seductive, in front of you there is a beautiful girl that wants you. Via! Change! Great laughter, great happiness, you have done 13 al totocalcio (sport lottery), Napoli have won the scudetto (title). Via! But you are really good! 3,000 lire. But they were not 2,000 lire? Yes, for the technical side. And then there are other lire 1,000 for the director. Take the lottery number, take the number, let's go, that is the last... You wait here, the pictures are coming out. You came the way you are. - Please, lawyer... - Sir, do you want coffee? Guy, please, let us talk! Lawyer, hear me out, you have to tell that I came from the right. Attorney Cascione! ...Elegant, lawyer! Chancellor! - I am Not the chancellor, I am a lawyer. - Lawyer, how did it go aunt Maria's case? - And who is aunt Maria? - It is my aunt, she must be a witness, but since she was ill, could not come, And said, 'you go instead'! - Lady, have patience, ask the usher. ... he threw himself under the car, lawyer! - follow me: you forget that it was a pedestrian and not a car that you run over. In this case, the right-of-way has no more value. - When your A112... - Elegant, lawyer! - Okay, Elegant! ...you went out from your place to go in road, you had to... Sorry, please, tell me where do I have to go here? - Ah, yes, lady, you need to turn... - Lady, please, you say can leave us talking? Lady? Lady. Come here. who are you looking for? - I have to request the pending charges certificate for my son Filuccio. - I ll give you the right directions, look at me. Go straight, then turn right, find a door, open it. There is a spiral staircase, you climb, step by step, being careful not you feel dizzy with your head. At the top of this staircase you will find another door, there is a sign: NO ENTRY. Don't give a fuck about the sign, you can find a long corridor, very crowdy one, you continue There is an hallway, you reach the end, you find another door, knock, open it and find two ushers. One... middle-aged, very short, has a withered hand, don't talk to him, because the morning is always drunk. Talk to the other one, he is skinny, he always has a cigarette in his mouth, it is called Al-fre-do, give him some money, He goes inside, takes the pending charges certificate, and I give them to you. Goodbye, and thanks. You go, and that our lady may be with you you. Thank you very much. Attorney Cascione! Look, mr. architect, a famous German philosopher once said, then, if we really want to say the truth, is a friend of the professor Bellavista, the real problem of humanity is to have, or be. Now I say, and correct me if I'm wrong from the moment that we Neapolitan we can't get, because we can't have, but at least we should be, or no? Eh, you're right, Saverion. You are right, However, in my opinion, the best solution, if we could have a little, and a little be. Attorney Cascione! Excuse me, please, have you seen Mr. Russo? Right now he was here. Ah, it seems to me that he has a case in the fourth section, beyond. Eh, he always has three or four cases at the same time. Let's do like this: you wait here, and I'm going to call him. - Yes, but in the meantime what do we do? - go to watch a case! The 27/12/82 at 13:15, a street patrol, Caught the defendants Sorrentino Pasquale and Sorrentino Vincenzo, Whom, taking advantage of the strike of workers at toll booths, Pretended to be working there, while cars and bikes passed by, acquiring unjust profit to the damage of the company InfraSud. Well, what you have to say? Mr president, what you said was full of mistakes. As you say! And okay then , tell us about it, the way it happened'. As I have already had the honour of saying when we have been called in the magistrate's court, that day, my honour, it was raining, but it was raining very much, and unfortunately we were left without an umbrella. - And without raining jacket! - Okay, Sorrentino, let's cut to the chase. Therefore, I and my dear brother who is here present, and who may be a witness, - I swear, I swear! having to go to the Vomero for family matters, we had asked for a lift to a very nice gentleman. - Friendly, a lord! - whom, however, was not going to the Vomero, but to Agnano, given that he worked at the racetrack for the horses. - Horses, Agnano. Va be', but to us this fact of the horses, dear Sorrentino, we are not interested in. Let's go ahead. - does Not affect - and Therefore as I was saying, this lord, so kind, arrived close Vomero exit, rightly made us to get off. - we said, "Thank you." - And he said: "You are welcome." You were all very polite people, it is true! Go ahead, Sorrentino, let's cut to the chase, let's go to the fact! ...and we started to walk towards the toll. We were leaving, when it arrived a quantity of water, a storm that I cannot describe, the sky was pitch black, the precipitation of rain. And the fog like in Milan! We made the weather forecast! Sorrentini! Let us go forward! Yes. Really he wanted to continue. It was I who said, "No, look, let's save ourselves under the toll". That is: "Let's be safe here under the tool cabin" if not we take pneumonia. Just, in short, we were there for about ten minutes, until, at a certain point, it seemed it was not rain. - That there was no rain! - No rain - Yes, I understand, I understand. Then I extended my hand to see if it was raining still, and it was in that precise moment that a car driver put 500 lire in my hand. - what would you have done? I took them! - And from that moment all gave us money. Here's the thing. And this, dear brothers Sorrentino, it's called scam! - Scam? The offer of motorists was a spontaneous - But if you also gave the change! To do the right thing for everyone. That crap, you've screwed another time. Lawyer, you need something? I don't need anything. Attorney, lawyer, this is my dear friend that I talked about before, the architect... - What's your name - Loffredo, very pleased. - Very pleased, very pleased. Dear architect, what can I say? The problem of 157 bis of Via Duomo, it is an old story, known by all. I am surprised that your uncle didn't say anything. My uncle, he wanted me to make a surprise. It is clear that it is not a about the money, 200,000 lire for those people it is like a packet of cigarettes. The fact is that it is a problem of territorial jurisdiction. You practically have a shop on the border. Whiskey, lighters, cigarettes, testimonies! - Whiskey, lighters, cigarettes, testimonies! - we do Not need anything. And I could not pay the 100,000 lire to one, and 100,000 lire to the other? Of course that you could this. If the two governments were to speak to each other. The problem is that these gentlemen, since some time, as soon as they meet, they shoot at each other. Just yesterday... I have lost two customers. And then what shall we do? You have to wait for things to calm down. In practice, you have to give me time to prepare a summit meeting. You, to avoid any misunderstand, for a couple of months, close the shop. A couple of months? And as get by? young man, this is not my fault! The fault, lady, is this birthday candle. And now I'll tell you: you remember me last year I came here and I bought 22 candles? They were for the birthday cake of my daughter, Patrizia. Lady, please, an express mail. Today my daughter has done 23 years: now it would be enough to buy a single candle. And this because together with the 22 of last year, there would be 23. No, sir. My wife has thrown out the 22 candles of the last year. I say: "But why did you throw them away?" "Because they were consumed." But how: "How did we consume them"!? You know how it is: you light the candles, no? Then everyone those say: "happy birthday to you"-, And Patrizia blows on the candles. No, she says: "We have consumed them", and she has thrown them in the garbadge. The truth is, madam, that the real need of the people today is this of throwing and buying, throw it and buy it, because this is consumerism, this is the source of all our troubles! Lady, an expressed mail, I have the car parked in the second row. The people of naples, once, they were not like this, they were saving everything. My mother, for example, kept all, not throwing away anything. I don't know, for example, was a candle stub? they kept them. Was there one string short short, that other people would have thrown away? Mamma no! Mom put aside, kept. Maybe put it in a box where she wrote on: 'Strings too short to be used'. But she kept them. Today, however, the young people of today, here they are, they are in a hurry. He needs to spend more money, he has to send this with the expressed mail, because this letter must go by express, you this I must say, why all this hurry? - Why? my car is parked in the second row - And it is because of this hurry that there is criminality, that there are drugs, there is the Camorra, dear sir, I would like to know what there is written in this crappy letter, eh! Lady, good-bye to ye. Madam, regular mail. Don Ferdinando, you have changed the lock of the mailbox? Cazzaniga has changed the order of the boxes. You have the apartment number 9? And the box with your number is 9. This Cazzaniga... do You understand that he changed the mail boxes? Salvatore, it is thirty years that I have the first box on the left, everyone knows about this in the palace. Now Cazzaniga comes and he put the mess in life. He moves the antenna, he moves the boxes! - moves our nerves! - Seriously! However, you do not have to be angry, professor. That is not people like us, they are from another race. - they drink the tea! - Yes, yes. And it's not that they drink it to show it to others, even when they are alone! He likes it! Salvatore, they might also drink poison, I do not mind, they can't make a mess in the palace!" - Good Morning - Good Morning - Please - Please, before you - You are welcome - You are welcome! - Ah, the light went off. - Hopefully not a blackout. - I pray god it is not! - if not we might stay here even one hour. - Eh, god forbid also this. - Wait, I have got some matches. - let's Try to play the alarm. - No, doctor, the alarm on this elevator it plays like this: SALVATORE! SALVATORE Professor! Professor, the elevator broke! Wait, doctor, just this morning I bought candles for the birthday of my daughter, Patrizia. - We are lucky. - here it is, this is for you, keep. - Thanks - No, it didn't light up. And this is for me. - Perfect. How old is your daughter? - You ask me to know how many candles can we have? - No, I did not think this. She turns 23. We have a lot of candles we can enjoy! - 23? Also my daughter Simona has 23. - Your daughter too? Salvatore! Salvatore! Professor, do not worry, I am on the third floor! I am aware of the situation you find yourself in... But we are all in solidarity with you. Everyone! - Salvatore, who is locked inside? - Bellavista and Cazzaniga. What does your daughter do? She studies, economics and commerce. But now she is a bit with her heads into the clouds, you know, we are in Naples for a few months, and... She doesn't know anyone, had to change all her habits, has no friends... she feels a bit lonely. I am sorry. But let's introduce them one another, these girls, on the other hand have also the same age. - With great pleasure. Also you daughter is studying? - Yes, I mean, I wanted to say, no, she is expecting a baby, she got married. The husband is an architect. Unemployed. - Eh, like all young neapolitans architects. - Eh, this is a problem. Professor! What are you doing? Do something about it! To pull you out, we have to operate by hand. - With the crank. - And what are you waiting for? It is half an hour that you don't do anything! We are waiting on the crank! Has Don Armando! As soon as it arrives we free you! For the moment, I can tell you only this: - Resist! - Excuse me, Salvatore. Professor, excuse me? A poetic thought: You who suffer in the gut the dark another time, climb the stairs, which is safer The divine comedy. Have you heard? This is Luigino, the poet. A beautiful fresh head! (= the head without thoughts) They have fun, and we here like two souls in the purgatory. Meanwhile, doctor, I am also becoming little bit hungry. Now I would not like to be pessimistic, but who knows how long we have to wait! - Eh, we're lucky, you had the candles, and if you are hungry, I have the panettone (xmas cake). - A cake these days? - Yes, we do have a cousin who has a small factory, and all the weeks he send them, fresh, it is very good. Instead, I confess that in my house the panettone is even prohibited. And yes, because of us at Christmas, we have other traditions, we make the struffoli, the rococo, mostaccioli, you have never tried the mostaccioli? - No. At Christmas we, for example, we have the presepe 'crib', but I know that you as the milanese do the Christmas tree, is that so? No, really, I... I'm also having the 'crib', as we say. - The crib? But you are not in milan? - Yes, of course. my father when we were kids were always preparing it, then I also wanted to do it with my daughter. Look, I have a curiosity, I Re Magi I never put them before the 25th of December, I wait for the "epiphany" (=January 6). - I keep faithful to the tradition. How is it for you? - Well, for us it is all a story, we have three series. So, the little ones we put them on the hill, at Christmas - Yes, of course. Then to one the first of the year in the middle of the road, we put the larger ones - Always riding! - And of course. And then, those without the horses, instead, in front of the hut, the day of the epiphany. And' everything. - This is a very good idea - And' very nice - This year I want to make this as well. Don Armando, what is happening, this crank was found or was not found? The professor is more than an hour waiting in the elevator! I have already explained to Salvatore, the crank has been taken by my son Peppiniello, he was playing as rail guy. He lost it in the sea. I beat him, see, he is crying, what should I do? You need to punish him! I have to punish him... Should we send him to Gaeta (=in youth prison), should we shoot him? So you tell me, what should we do? this panettone is very good. this is my cousin's has a small factories, an artisan, and it is as if it were home-made. Doctor, I confess one thing: I thought you were different. Different in what sense? I don't know... more nordic. For example, I have said that you get up every morning at 6 because in spite of being the head of the staff of the Alfa Romeo, You want to be punctual in the office. It's true, eh? - But what does this has to do with anything? Eh, it does, it does! Because all this sense of duty, this stoicism, is typical of you in the north. It is only civilization. If it were up to me, I stay in bed until noon. I like reading the newspaper in bed, and even when they bring me a good cup of coffee. - A tea, you would like to say - No, no, if you give me tea in the morning is like if you give me a slap. My wife is the one who loves tea, but you know, she is German... and germans, dear professor, they are not like us. We are always south from someone! Back, What are these manners! stop! He is right, stop. We have to help, the poor professor! Not only is the inside closed with Cazzaning, but as well he is dying of thirst. - Do you understand? Do you understand you? Now let's try to send as a minimum a little bit of water. And so we were forced to close the shop. Giorgio is still unemployed, So we don't see a way out. Certainly, in Naples the situation is dramatic. At Pomigliano there are a lot of people that ask me for a job. It is needless to say that you don't need architects, huh? No, Pomigliano no, but... I thought about it just before: in Milan I have a brother in law who has a construction company. But, are the kids willing to relocate? According to me... this here is a classic traffic knot jam. Doctor, Patrizia is the eighth month. In a month the child is born. I might as well bring her back down for the birth. What about you, what would you recommend to me, this child has to be born in Naples or in Milan? The grandson of the professor Bellavista has to be born in Naples. Yes, however, if one of the documents he wrote: 'Born in Milan, according to me find a job more easily. - is it true? - No... Is simply not true. If you look at the documents of those who work in Milan, we discover they are born everywhere but there Rather, as we put it with your theories? If the child was born in Milan, this changes his character. And you may have a grandchild that instead of being a man of love, he is a man of freedom, or am I wrong? I have never said that a man of love must be born by only in Naples. You, for example, you are a classic man of love, born in Milan. Thank you, very kind. But you know, the environment where one lives, influences the character. If your grandson grows up in Milan, is condemned: it will be Milanese. To be clear: I respect and appreciate the people of milan. I find them, how to say, more practical, people more civil. But what is it doing that one there? Oe', idiot! (=offense milanese) Nevertheless, in this world of progress, in this world full of missiles and atomic bombs, I think that Napoli is still the last hope of humanity to survive. Madonna, what a traffic! Translation By: RoccoL
