- in the 17th Century, Dutch and English battleships in miles long formations, unleashed mile and broadsides against each other in years of ruinous and wretched war. - These battles are enormous. There's a hundred ships in each side. There are thousands of men involved. If you lose this naval battle, the Dutch will lose their trade. They'll go bankrupt. The English will go bankrupt. They will lose the war. This is not about small beer. This is big business. - The English and the Dutch fought the largest sea battles in the age of sail, with firepower unequalled by any artillery force on land. In the balance, hung each country's role in world trade for the next two centuries. - The Dutch and the British are the two great commercial powers of the world. Their merchants are fanning out across the globe, from the west to the East Indies, and they're running into each other and shooting each other up. - All over the world, these emerging empires collide, but as these countries compete for market shares abroad, they must also forge personal liberty at home. People in both countries, for the first time in the modern era, are demanding that their governments guarantee personal freedoms, including freedom of religion. - Because of the religious conflicts in Europe, the Dutch had the realisation that there had to be toleration. There had to be liberty of conscience. There had to be freedom of the individual. - While the Dutch guarantee religious freedoms, England wavers between modest toleration and a state religion strictly enforced. How these superpowers tolerated religious and personal freedoms would affect the lives of people in both societies within their own borders and on an island far from the centre of the world, Manhattan, and in a country that would embrace these freedoms in its constitution a century later. But until there was stability within and between countries, personal freedoms were far from secure. And in the first half of the 17th Century, religious wars ravaged Europe. Catholic Spain's armies attacked Protestant Holland. Religious quarrels in England erupted into a civil war. Thousands were killed. In England, the king, Charles I, fought with his parliament over taxes and with his people over religion. - Charles I was regarded by his people as being a tyrant who raised taxes without the consent of Parliament and who was also trying to push The Church of England into the direction of Catholicism, and this was a country that was very, very anti-Catholic. - For almost a century, the English viewed Catholic rulers as arbitrary and despotic. When Charles I tried to change religious practise, his people rebelled. - There was widespread rioting in 1640 and '41 against some of the religious innovations that he tried to introduce. Also against some of his Catholic advisers, and that fed into 1642 with the outbreak of the civil war. - The army raised by Parliament to oppose King Charles I took on a political life of its own. It's zealous commander, Oliver Cromwell, after defeating royal armies, demanded Charles be tried and executed. - When the king's head was actually chopped off, the soldiers cheered and a great groan went up from the rest of the crowd. - With the death of Charles I, Cromwell soon annihilated an army led by the king's son, Charles II. Charles II narrowly escaped capture and sailed into years of long exile. Cromwell soon emerged as the leader of both the army and Parliament, who made him Lord Protector, a dictator by any other name. But Cromwell could not live forever. - So in 1658, Oliver Cromwell dies, and the years from 1658 to 1660 are complete, utter political and economic chaos. And by the end that period, popular opinion in England believes that the only way to restore stability in England is to return to the monarchy. - It may seem strange to anybody who's a citizen of a modern republic that the British should have a republic for just 11 years and then give it up a and bring back their monarchy, but our only republic in Britain was not produced by revolution by the people as in France or by throwing off the foreign tyranny, as in America. It was produced by a small minority of the population who wanted to have a radical religion and radical politics, and what the people wanted was to have back the king and the aristocracy and the old church, and so they got it. - The road was lined 30 people deep all the way from Rochester to London, and the crowds got denser and denser as you got to London. It really was an an immense sort of emotional release, really, with the king's return. This was England returning to normal, finally getting over a very bad dream. Returning to the natural rule of monarchy. - 1660, Charles II was no longer a footnote to history but at its centre. To make certain his view of the civil war endured, Charles entrusted Samuel Pepys to record his story. It is Samuel Pepys's secret diary that gave later generations the most intimate view of the reign of Charles II, often word for word. - Well, Mr. Pepys, we thank you for transcribing our story. It was a very brutal and bloody time. - Oh, it is my pleasure, Your Majesty. It is a story that should be comprehended by all. - Charles met Lady Castlemayne shortly after he returned from exile, the daughter of a loyalist aristocrat who lost his fortune in the civil war, she became Charles' principal mistress for the next ten years. - So after the battle with Cromwell, his troops all around, how did you escape? - I took the resolution of putting myself into a disguise. With an ordinary pair of grey cloth breeches, a leather doublet and a green jacket. I also cut my hair very short. As soon as I was disguised, I chose to trust Richard Penderel, a Roman Catholic. - Would not Cromwell's troop rumble every Catholic house in the country? - Yes, but I knew they had hiding holes for priests. Penderel told me it would be very dangerous for me to stay either in the house or go out into the wood, as the enemy would be certain to search both. But he knew of one way to pass the next day, and that was to get up inside a great, big oak. - Was not the oak in the wood? - No, it was separate and in plain sight, and so less suspicious. We could view all around without being seen. Soldiers going up and down looking for persons escaped. - And all the Penderels pretending perfect ignorance. Very brave. Charles has rewarded them on his return. - In later consultations, Colonel Lane said that he had a sister who had a fair pretence of going to Bristol to a cousin of hers and that she might take me there as her servant. And from Bristol I might find shipping to get me out of England, which, with God's help, I did. - In the first years of his reign, Charles II worked to rebuild his power, wealth, and prestige. In 1664, he begins to focus on foreign affairs and to work that blunt tool of state craft, military force. In America, he has just granted his brother, James, Duke of York, all of the land centred on the Hudson River, but the Duke's new claim is not without problems. It includes a colony, New Netherland, owned and governed by the Dutch. It is that defect Charles now addresses. - Charles, you have served James a generous slice of America. - Yes, but even a small swallow of the Dutch will be a challenge to keep down for the Duke of York. - And that, no doubt, depends on our canonicals. He seems quite ready for his private instructions. - Your majesty, Lady Castlemayne. - Colonel Nichols. As we publicly directed, you are to observe and report to us the sentiments of our bleak government in Massachusetts. - I will insinuate myself into the good opinion of the principal persons there, your majesty. - Privately. The greater goal of your endeavour is the seizing of Manhattan, reducing that people to an entire submission and obedience to us. Secure that whole region, so that the Dutch may no longer exercise that trade, which they have wrongfully possessed themselves of. Trade now vested in our brother, the Duke of York. - Colonel Nichols departs for America, with secret orders from Charles to take over the Dutch colony at Manhattan. The Dutch call their territory between the English colonies and New England and Virginia, New Netherland. For two generations, the Dutch have shipped fur and foodstuffs down the mile-wide Hudson River to New Amsterdam, The colony's largest port, at the tip of Manhattan Island. Manhattan supports farms, orchards, and land for grazing. By 1664, over 2,000 Dutch colonists live in New Amsterdam. After decades of conflict, they now live among and trade peaceably with Native Americans. As summer of 1664 ends, the harvests begin, and the whole of New Amsterdam breathes a festive air. But suddenly, on this balmy August day, an alarm sounds as war ships appear in the harbour. The militia rushes to battle stations in the fort. Inside the fort, they await orders from Peter Stuyvesant, the Director General of this remote Dutch outpost. - How many ships? - Four. - Guns? - About 100. - Troops? - A thousand plus one-thousand more Long Islanders with a hundred horse. More gathering are Brooklyn by the hour. - What say our towns to every third man? - They will not come. - What say our Burgermeisters? - They will not fight. - My son? - He will not. - Our troops are 200? - 150, General. Fifty sick. - I have ill feelings about this day myself, Lieutenant. We have powder on short for only a few hours. We must delay. Delay in the hope of timely reinforcements from the fatherland. Send the English general our request to know the purpose of his coming. He has not, as yet, to our great surprise given us any knowledge of his purpose. With 100 peace-loving guns, I'm sure he means no prejudice against us. - Lieutenant, in His Majesty's name, I do demand the town upon the island commonly known as Manhattan with the fort there, rendered to His Majesty's obedience and protection. Tell your director general that we do not wish the effusion of Christian blood, but without complete submission, you will provoke the miseries of war. - Stuyvesant had little military experience. He really was an administrator. So when the frigates arrived, he tried to save New Amsterdam, because he knew he couldn't defend it. It's quite clear that if Stuyvesant had decided to fight, that New Amsterdam would have suffered very much. His only chance was to play for time, and there was hope that relief forces from The Netherlands could come in and take over accordingly once again, and that exportation was not unrealistic at all. - Finally, the threat of overwhelming force and generous terms from Nichols convinces Stuyvesant to surrender without firing a shot. - So giving up New Amsterdam was the right decision. It saved the town. - The terms maintained property rights and as important, Dutch religious freedom, and as the Dutch swear allegiance to their new sovereign, Manhattan gets a new name, New York, after it's prince and patron, James, Duke of York. Charles II is confidently provoking The Netherlands, one of the largest maritime powers in the world. He knows that Cromwell's navy had defeated the Dutch in a war ten years before, while he was in exile. What he does with the navy now will inevitably be compared to what Cromwell did with it in the first Anglo-Dutch War. This war, ostensibly about trade, was as ruinous as it was inconclusive. While the English were victorious in the home waters of the North Sea, the Dutch defeated them in the Mediterranean, destroying English trade, and in the Baltic, threatening the supply of English shipbuilding materials. - The Dutch idea, essentially was that you just sailed at the enemy head on. You ran alongside. You fired off a few guns as you approach. But basically, it came down to boarding. That was what the Dutch expected, and that was what the Dutch were good at. - The English discovered the only answer to this was not to try and do what the Dutch did, but to do something else. In the first Anglo-Dutch War, the English ships were bigger and more heavily armed. They had a firepower advantage, and that could best be used by forming a single line ahead and firing broadsides. And once you've knocked the Dutchmen's masts away, they don't manoeuvre very well. If you kill the crew, cripple the ship, you win the battle. So the English pioneered a firepower-based tactical revolution. - Off the southeast coast of England, near Gabbard, Cromwell's navy used the in-line formation for the first time. It resulted in one of the worst defeats in Dutch naval history. - They carefully arranged themselves in line. The Dutch came at them in the same group of unorganised squadrons, and the English just chopped them to pieces, firing at them at long range for hour after hour. - Seventeenth Century naval warfare is attritional combat. It's not decisive. It's not knockout. You don't sink the enemy ship with a single shot. You knock it to pieces and kill the crew. So it takes forever. It takes hours and hours to resolve these battles. Men were being knocked over by large, jagged pieces of wood, often referred to as splinters, but not the sort you get in your finger while you're doing carpentry. This splinter will be 6 feet long. It'll weigh 100 pounds, and it'll be razor sharp, and if it hits you, it won't stick in your finger. It'll cut you in half. - Seventeen ships sunk or captured. Thousands killed and wounded. After two years of war and the horrendous losses at Gabbard, the Dutch people looked to their government for relief. Two powerful factions in The Netherlands vie for power. One faction, rich Burgers, the merchant elite, want desperately to end the war. Opposed to the wealthy merchants was The War Party, called Orangists, let by Prince William of Orange. Because his wife, Mary Stuart, was the daughter of Charles I, William had naturally supported the English monarchy during the civil war. He died of smallpox just a few days before Mary gave birth to their son, William III. William II's death left the Orangists leaderless and allowed the Republican Burgers to gain control of the government. The merchant elite, hating the war that crippled their trade, installed their own leader, Johan De Witt. - De Witt was appointed in 1653 in a period of severe crisis. The Dutch were involved in a war against England, a war that they were not capable of winning. Their fleet was simply not strong enough. Johan De Witt was a very young lawyer from the city of Dordrecht, and he soon proved to be very capable, and what he believed is that a true Republican regime should not be democratic in our modern sense of the word. It should basically be an aristocracy led by well educated and well-off reagents like himself. - The war is a disaster. We must end it. We can make our best terms now. Cromwell will be happy enough to make peace with us, his Protestant brethren, and make war on the Antichrists in Spain. Then we must build a fleet that can take English broadsides and give back in kind. - De Witt was really eager to conclude a peace treaty and Cromwell, surprisingly, let him off the hook. The conditions, more or less, imposed on the Dutch were remarkably lenient. - Cromwell wanted to end the destructive war with the Dutch, but more importantly, he wanted to keep the Orangists, who were supporting Charles II in exile, from gaining power in The Netherlands. - The key to the peace treaty is not any sort of economic issue. It's the seclusion of the Prince of Orange from power in The Netherlands. That, for Oliver Cromwell, is the key element of the peace, and it's something which John De Witt is only too happy to accede to. - With the treaty, William III, only 3 years old, is formally excluded from power. When Charles II was restored to his throne, he tried to pursue Johan De Witt to reinstate his nephew, William, to his hereditary titles and privileges. De Witt refused and even excluded Charles from a role in William's education. There was no love lost between De Witt and Charles, but Charles had larger problems at his restoration than the education of his nephew. - One of the great problems for the restored Stuart monarchy is poverty. The king has no money. The state isn't going to give him very much. The royal revenues aren't very great. So where does the money come from? Everybody believes there's only so much trade. You can't make new trade. You just grab the trade from somebody else. Who has the trade? The Dutch. Do we like the Dutch? No. They're Republicans. They're not really our kind of people at all. So let's go and grab the trade from the Dutch. - Just as Charles II had sent Nichols to seize New Amsterdam, he also approved a raid on Dutch outposts down the coast of Africa by Robert Holmes, who, like, Nichols, had supported his cause during his exile. - The classic restoration military hatchet man is Robert Holmes. He is an old cavalier from the civil war. He then takes to the sea, and he's kind of a mixture of a courtier and a pirate. Robert Holmes is given war ships and is sent down to West Africa to wreck havoc among the Dutch markets, and basically chase them away. - Secretary Roche, direct our ambassador to entreat Charles what calls for this irresponsible violence from his subject, Robert Holmes? Along the coast of Africa, he has plundered our trade and possessed himself of our ships and forts. - An appeal will amuse the king. No doubt, Holmes sailed under the royal instruction of James, just as Nichols enjoyed the complacency of the king himself! - Our public stance will be to demand restoration and reparation and to insist Holmes and Nichols be arrested upon their return. However, to effect a more direct restitution, we shall send the De Ruyter with our Mediterranean fleet to Africa. And then, God willing, to America. - De Witt had recruited Michiel De Ruyter to command the Dutch Mediterranean fleet. He was experienced, highly skilled, and above all, loyal. - The English had captured some Dutch forts in West Africa. They had done that in a period of peace. Johan De Witt decided that it would be good to send a fleet in the Mediterranean to recapture it, but how could you keep this secret? Every decision would be mentioned to the English, certainly if you paid some money. - De Witt knows several Dutch legislators have been selling Dutch secrets to the English. So the Dutch leader sends these spies, one by one, to the next meeting. After they are gone, De Witt attaches the orders to send De Ruyter, his trusted admiral, with the Mediterranean fleet to Africa. - It is in the official minutes, but people are not going to read minutes, and the instruction for De Ruyter was immediately sent to Spain and reached him, and he immediately sailed to West Africa. - Charles knows nothing of De Ruyter's counter raid to Africa, but might approve of it if he did. He needs war fever to get Parliament's support. He already has General Monck, the head of the army, who restored Charles to his throne in a war lather, and while Charles feigns ignorance of Holmes' raid, Monk goads Samuel Pepys, an influential member of the Navy Board, to support the war program. - General Monk, now our Lord Albemarle, this is Mr. Samuel Pepys, the Earl of Montague's cousin. Clerk of the Navy Board and a very clever fellow. - We assured the ambassador on our princely word that we gave no commission or order to Captain Holmes to demonstrate on Africa. Nor do we know upon what grounds he proceeded to that act of hostility. - Well, I spoke with Holmes before he sailed. He discoursed of the good effects in some kind of a Dutch war, saying that the trade of the world is too little for us too, and therefore, one must doubt. - The Dutch have too much trade, and we resolve to take it from them. - They were no friend to our king in exile until his restoration. - It was so. For years to indulge Cromwell's ill will, the Dutch shunned me as they would a leper with intemperate decay. On news of my return as king, they celebrates us in the Hague with feasts and dance, and they gave us a yacht. - What a pusillanimous people. - I tremble still to thoughts of Amboina. - Over a half century ago, in Indonesia, at their trading post at Amboina, the Dutch capture a spy who implicates English merchants in a plot to seize the fort. The Dutch arrest, torture to confession, and behead the alleged English conspirators. - It was just something that really burnt into the English psyche. There were poems about Amboina. There were plays about Amboina. - Amboina can again repeat anywhere the Dutch hold power. - The only laws they respect derive from the broadsides of cannon. - All the court is mad for a Dutch war. It seems in our whole kingdom, I am the only soul for peace. - As an outsider to Charles' inner circle, Pepys may not appreciate the irony in Charles' peaceful sentiments. He does not know Charles authorised the Nichols and Holmes raids, but De Witt knows and has already sent De Ruyter to reclaim Africa, and De Witt does not intend to stop there. - Where is Holmes now? - Portugal. Off the coast near Lisbon. - When will he arrive back in England? - Two months. De Ruyter has already retaken Gorée and a number of English ships. He will sweep the coast by December. - Here, further orders to De Ruyter. After Africa, to the Caribbean. Inflict by way of reprisal as much damage as possible at Barbados, New Netherlands, Newfoundland. Seize as many merchant men and stores of sugar and tobacco as you can bring home. Demolish those you cannot. Ransack their plantations. Destroy their fisheries. Then pursue home by the shortest course, north about England. - News of De Ruyter's successful counter-raid down the coast of Africa reaches England at about the same time as Holmes returns. Now a war with the Dutch is virtually certain. - I hear fully the news of our being beaten to dirt at Guinea. De Ruyter with his fleet hath proceeded to the taking of whatever we have, forts, goods, ships, and men. All of Holmes' work is undone. - Not all, he has arrived at Plymouth with many prizes, gold, ivory, Dutch ships. - What says Holmes of the reports of cowardice of his captains? - He comes now. Ask him directly. Monk! How goes it? - Holmes, welcome home. Mr. Pepys. So how big the treasure? Hundreds of thousands of pounds. We shall have a count soon. The Prize Commission sniffs over the ships as a scavenger over a meaty carcass. - Major Holmes, I should warn you, some claim that you exceeded your orders to protect our trade only. - Protect our trade? We have no trade to protect. No, I went to bash the Dutch over their head and steal as much of their trade by force as I could. That's what I interpreted my instructions to mean. - And that is certainly what they were meant to mean. - And that's what I did. - Does De Ruyter's raid trouble you? - Sir, that my captains may have yielded too easily? Well that is conjecture for Whitehall warriors. Broadsides look very different at 50 feet. De Ruyter's success means there will be war and great opportunity. - I worry of our shortage of money to fund our navy. - We will take our funding from Dutch merchant men. The king sends Allen to meet the Smirnoff fleet. Many rich prizes. Let us hope. Good day, gentlemen. - Pepys has many firm opinions for one with no experience. - He is an irritating fellow, but he has a pretty wife who I feign to be free and friends with, perhaps after the war. - Pepys diary records his shock at Holmes attention to his wife at parties, as it records his dismay at the rush into an ill-advised war. - The English made an attack, again, unprovoked and without declaration of war on a big Dutch merchant fleet, and, of course the Dutch were enraged and the Dutch knew now that they couldn't possibly avoid major war. - The attack not against our outposts, but against the heart of our commerce from the Mediterranean means we are de facto at war with England! - Ya! For your approval, orders to the admiralties. After consideration, it is resolved and concluded to authorise you to attack, conquer, and ruin the English everywhere! Both in and out of your, on land and sea, with whatever force through God's blessing you may now have under our authority! Charles will have his war! - Charles wants war, but the war he wants, short, decisive, and profitable, may not be the war he gets. The navy is already spending Parliament's largest authorisation ever, over 2-million pounds, and Charles knows the danger many will encounter, including his own brother, James, and his longtime friend and companion in exile, Lord Falmouth. - Falmouth. Falmouth! Riley, our painter, claims this to be my portrait. If they're not fish, I'm an ugly fellow. - Oh, no, Your Majesty. It is just Riley's irregular palsy. As he recovers, so will your portrait. - Falmouth, I very believe thou art the wickedest dog in all England. - For a subject, your majesty, I believe I am. - Here's James and his guards. - Then, you majesty, I will take my leave. - My dearest Falmouth, take care of James. Until we breed our queen, he is all we have. - Charles' concern for his brother, James, is not only personal, but dynastic. Charles' two-year marriage to Catherine of Braganza has produced no heirs. Though James is next in line to the throne, he will still sail with and command the fleet with his best captains, like Monk and Holmes. - Your Majesty. - General Monck, our brother, James, has discoursed on the good effect in the last Dutch war of formations in line. - Yes, Your Majesty, and signals. If we get the weather wind, we form into a line of three squadrons. With full fleet, 8 miles long. - Ships in battle formation usually sail and attack at an angle to the wind. If their opponents were sailing on the same tack, the upwind fleet was the fleet on the side closer to the wind. The downwind fleet was the fleet further from where the wind was blowing. The upwind fleet was said to have the weather wind. The downwind fleet was said to be to the Lee. If any ship to Lee tried to grapple, it would sail into the wind, lose speed, and be subjected to broadsides from more than one ship. - What if the Dutch try to grapple? - Oh, as long as we have the wind, we can stay back and use our heavy cannons to full result. No ship of ours blocks the field of fire from any other. - What about you old pirates, Holmes? Can you be taught new tricks? - Yes, Your Majesty. As long as the Dutch attack in piecemeal squadrons, we can stand off and stomp them. - They will plaster about their many admirals. As long as one Dutch city distrusts the others, which is to say, long enough for us to prevail. We wish you all good fortune. - Your Majesty. - The Dutch fleet is not really a national navy. They have five different admiralties. The two biggest one are Rotterdam and Amsterdam, which is both Holland, but Rotterdam and Amsterdam are great rivals, and the third big one is Zeeland. Admirals from different admiralties don't have an agreed order of seniority. They had a serious political problem there in actually trying to impose unity on this fleet. - Under De Witt's leadership, the competing Dutch cities have agreed to do one thing. Build a strong navy. The result is dozens of large war ships that can, as De Witt had urged 10 years ago: - Take English broadsides and give back in kind. - These new ships were coming into service just as the second Dutch war started. The English were actually not sufficiently aware that the Dutch were catching up with them in terms of building serious war ships. - The biggest class was between 160 and 170 feet, and they carried up to 80 guns. That was still a little bit less than what the English had, but on the other hand, our guns were a little bit heavier. When the ship fired one broadside, that was all the guns on one side of the ship, it lost a half-ton in weight. It must've been terrible to watch and to hear. - De Witt's new fleet is not quite ready in early 1665, and more important, De Ruyter, the one leader all admiralties will follow, is not back from his raid to the Caribbean and the east coast of America. Looking for a reliable stand in for De Ruyter, De Witt appoints Baron Van Obdam to command the Dutch fleet. Obdam has seen success in the Baltic Sea between wars, but now faces a battle of unprecedented scale. The Dutch and English fleets each have over 100 ships and 20,000 seamen, but while the Dutch war ships capable of firing half-ton broadsides are not yet in service, the English already have 27. As important, the English have developed tactical manoeuvres, to use their superior fire power to devastating effect. - The English had two manoeuvres that they used to change course. The first was just tacking in succession. The first ship in the line tacked and everyone followed him around at the same spot. Tacking from the rear meant that the ship that initiated the move was the ship at the tail end of the line, and as soon as he started, all the others tried to do so as well. - Tacking from the rear took extraordinary coordination, signalling, and skill. When the English began doing the manoeuvre with fleets of 100 ships, even the Dutch, no mean sailors themselves, were in awe. - The English fleet moved north a little bit off Lowestoft. Both sides were actively seeking a battle. The Dutch commander, Obdam, knew that he was outgunned, but he needed a battle to drive the English from the sea before that rich, East India convoys came home. Off Lowestoft, fleets met in two head-on passes, and at the end of the second pass, the English were able to tack together and get on the same tack with the Dutch and to windward of them and then pounded them to pieces the same way they had at the Battle of the Gabbard in 1653. Right at the heart of it, James' flagship, The Royal Charles, engages Obdam's flagship, and it's one on one, and eventually, Obdam is killed. His flagship blows up. The Dutch don't know who's in command. So they flee. The English chase them, and but for an unfortunate order given by one of James's courtiers, the war might well have been over that night. - To keep James out of harm's way, one of his courtiers halts the pursuit of the Dutch. Earlier in the battle, three members of the court standing close to James were cut to pieces. One of those killed was Charles' dearest friend, Falmouth. - Hold there. The king receives no audience. He mourns Paul Falmouth, as we all do. I am troubled for the king. He has not eaten well, nor slept, these last few nights. Pray for him. - The king, it seems, is much troubled at the fall of My Lord of Falmouth. - Wish him not alive again Pepys. He was a man of too much pleasure to do the king any good or offer any good office to him. - But he was a man of great honor and it shows in his going with the Duke. The most that ever any man did. As did Sanson, the same, our bravest admiral, who I am impositioned humbly to replace. - But the Duke has determined the flag will go to Harmon. His own captain. - Harmon? Harmon? Harmon! I do see that I have enemies about me! They do me prejudice. They will not suffer me to rise. I can't continue. I must, I will resign! - A rash, proud cock sill. He will not be dissuaded. His home's so rich, he seeks occasion of leaving the service. - The Duke will take his resignation now with some disgust, but by the next fleet season, all will be friends. Holmes will have a good ship again, and honours too, no doubt. - While England mourns a few courtiers, the Dutch mourn a calamity. - The Dutch, in that particular case, lost about 17 vessels one way or the other, and something like 5,000 plus dead. Now these are large numbers when talked about of people coming from maritime communities, and they make a huge dent in societies. It's not just the size of the losses, it's the relative impact it has on coastal communities. The first result of the Dutch war is a terrific victory for the English off Lowestoft. One of the great naval victories of British history, And the Dutch are trounced. The trouble is, being a naval battle, they just sail home and start getting repaired. - Charles keeps pressure on the Dutch by bribing the German Bishop of Munster to attack the Dutch on their eastern border. Munster has had territorial disputes with the Dutch and is eager to exploit their weak land defences. With the Dutch army unprepared for the assault, the bishop quickly occupies several towns. Everything is going Charles' way, but then, out of nowhere, the plague. - The plague hitting London in 1665 and people were dropping dead in the streets like leaves were falling off trees in autumn. - But Lord, what a sad time it is to see poor wretches in the streets. Over 7,000 dead in one week. The biggest bill yet, which is very grievous for us all. - The plague is the beginning of a reversal of English fortune. Early the next year, even the attack by the Bishop of Munster goes bad. It convinces King Louis XIV of France to honor his defencive treaty with the Dutch. Louis has the largest and best trained army in Europe. His navy is not as large as England's, but it tips the strategic balance in favor of the Dutch. - The French, under Louis XIV, the strongest power in Western Europe, now come in on the Dutch side and declare war upon Britain, and that means that Charles is back to square one with twice as many enemies as before. - The spirit of the Dutch soars with the announcement of their new French alliance, and they finally commission their powerful warships. As important, De Witt can deliver these new ships to a leader he can trust, De Ruyter has returned. - After the Battle of Lowestoft, the Dutch flag officers met and decided that they needed to adopt the English system and needed to adopt it as quickly as possible. - De Witt and De Ruyter review the fleet, which now includes the newly commissioned war ships. They then meet with Cornelis Tromp, second in command, and Cornelis Evertsen, a young captain who fought at Lowestoft. - With France now with us, we have a new war. At least our dear friend, the Munster has something to think about. - Charles has no money to pay him. Louis will send Munster home. But what will Louis do by sea? What think you, Tromp? Thank you for joining us. My job was to have been yours after Obdam perished. It is a noble patriot to give service to his country. - Nobel indeed. I am here. De Witt knows how to persuade or twist arms as need be. To answer, Louis will do as little as possible and still preserve his honor. He may distract some of the English fleet. - Good. Evertsen, you were at Lowestoft. What caused that difficulty? - The English formation. Unified, in line, using their big guns. They turned in unison. The whole fleet. With the debts, our small squadrons were like so many nets for swatting. - But we have always been able to close on board. - If they have the weather wind, we never will. - This is troubling. Coming off fighters we have done for a hundred years. - Not and win. All the captains feel as I. - Tromp, what think you? - The young captains are right. So many times, half our fleet cannot fire because our own ships are in the way. - Do it bother that we imitate the English system? - No, they are not so clever. Even a blind hog will find a truffle. - Well, let us hope that that the blind hogs are at the tillers this summer. - While the Dutch practised their new tactical formations, Charles plans to send part of his fleet under his cousin, Prince Rupert, to block the French fleet sailing into The Channel while reserving the larger part of his fleet to face the Dutch under the Duke of Albemarle, but splitting the fleet is a risk. The Dutch will almost certainly outnumber Albemarle's squadrons. So Charles needs his best captains to sail with Albemarle and he recruits Holmes back into service. - Well, Sir Robert, your knighthood sits well on you, as does your new ship, Defiance. Both are great honours, Your Majesty. I hope to give you many victories in return. - You will, I'm certain. Your squadron is manned and fitted? - Within the week. I go with Albemarle's group, duties to which I must now attend. Your Majesty. - Monck, I say, I mean, Albemarle, you have been Duke since our restoration. I will reform my mind to Albemarle. - Your Majesty may call me as he pleases. My wife even calls me Monck still in our bedchamber. - The Duke of Albemarle, the name doubly reforms me then, so as to avoid your bedchamber. Too crowded for us three. Albemarle, what think you of our split of the fleet? - Until we know the French positions, a necessary evil, Your Majesty. We cannot let the French combine with the Dutch. - Aye, and we have recent intelligence, says that French ships are boarding soldiers for attack in Ireland. You have 70 ships in your squadron. - When all are manned and fitted, Your Majesty. As of now, the number available stands near 60. - So if the Dutch stay in port until the French come up, we will be ready. - And if the Dutch come sooner, Your Majesty, do I fight? Or wait? - You make that decision, Monck. I mean, Albemarle. As the situation dictates and as you see fit. - We will look for opportunities, Your Majesty. As at Gabbard and Lowestoft. - Splendid! - The Duke of Albemarle knew that he was outnumbered. He had warned the king, and the kind simply said, "You should do what you think prudent." And that was a terrible mistake, because the Duke of Albemarle took that to be an order to attack. The weather was rather poor. The seas were rough. The Dutch were at anchor and could not imagine that the English would attack. The wind, which was blowing hard from the southwest, would heel the English ships over so far that they would not be able to use their biggest guns on the lower deck. - But Albemarle sees an opportunity, turns his fleet and heads straight for an exposed Dutch squadron. The Dutch finally realise that the English are attacking. The Dutch squadron under Tromp cuts its anchor cables and get underway just in time. - The fleets then engaged in a running fight for several hours, but the seas were so rough that the damage was not very great. Albemarle's intention had been to overwhelm this exposed division of the Dutch. In that, they completely failed. - As Albemarle approaches shallows, he signals his fleet to tack, but one English squadron does not see the signal and keeps on going. Just then, disaster strikes the Dutch. - Cornelis Tromp's flagship, The Hollandia, was involved in a collision and was completely disabled. The English admiral made straight for Tromp's flagship through the Dutch fleet. - But Albemarle, already heading in the opposite direction, cannot support this bold move. The Dutch grapple the English attacker. The first Dutch marines on board the English ship encounter fierce resistance, but the marines from a second ship lay down planks and board in force. It is soon over. The Dutch capture three English ships. As night falls, the English admiralty sends a fast boat down the channel with an urgent message for Rupert. "Battle begun. Return without delay." - The weather on the second day was much quieter than it was on the first day, and it was a hot day. The Dutch fleet with the Lee gauge was at a considerable disadvantage, and the smoke from the guns tended to drift down. So that they frequently couldn't see what was going on as well as the windward fleet. - De Ruyter wants to gain the weather wind. He leads the Dutch fleet to break through the English line, but the rear squadron, Tromp's squadron, does not get through and is surrounded by English war ships. - De Ruyter realised that Tromp was in difficulty. So he gathered a small squadron and sailed straight to Tromp's position and drove off the English ships that were attacking him. - By the end of the second day, with many ships damaged, Albemarle disengages and sails north. - The English, on the third day, realised that they had to retreat. Albemarle sent all of the damaged and smaller ships ahead, as best they could, and he gathered up 16 of the largest ships, each of which could bring, perhaps, six to eight guns bear on stern, and drew them up in a line abreast. - The Duke of Albemarle's heavy guns keep the Dutch at bay until the early afternoon, when he sites Rupert's squadron and sails to join it. - The English pilots, in all the confusion of the battle, had lost track of where they were, and they ran the fleet straight onto Galloper Sand, a nasty sand bank. Many of the big ships struck. All of them got off except one, The Royal Prince, a 92-gun, three decker. - The Dutch easily capture the Prince, but De Ruyter orders it burned, not wanting to spare any ships taking it into port as a prize. He needs his full force of ships, now numbering about 70, for the next day's battle. - At the beginning of the fourth day, the Dutch held the wind. - Albemarle and Rupert decide to attack to regain the wind. The English fleet has over 50 ships, including Rupert's, that are undamaged, have a full supply of ammunition, and without casualties, have full crews. - The English ships broke through the Dutch and gained the wind, and in the process, split the Dutch fleet. At one point, late in the day, it appeared that the English were winning the fight. - As De Ruyter sails north, he looks like he is abandoning the beleaguered ships and taking the rest of his fleet back to port. - The English believed that the Dutch were retiring, but De Ruyter suddenly tacked again directly on the English fleet with all of the strength that he had, and for the first time in the battle, the Dutch were able to make their numbers tell. At this point, the English were overwhelmed. The fleet fell into disorder, and several ships were captured. - The English withdrawal into The Thames. De Ruyter, out of ammunition, heads home too. The carnage of this battle, almost 4,000 killed, and an equal number wounded, but the Dutch win their first important victory of the second Anglo-Dutch War. - It was one of the greatest victories that the Dutch ever won over the English. They wrote about it in songs and struck metals for it. - Both sides learned valuable lessons from the Four Days' Battle. The English now clearly saw that with their new ships, the Dutch fleet had much greater firepower, and adopting English tactics, they now fought in line. The Dutch learned that even when outnumbered, the English would fight. The Dutch are soon to learn another lesson. No naval victory confers a permanent advantage. As long as the English can refit damaged ships and commission new ones, there will be another massive, bloody, ruinous battle. The war is far from over. In the first Anglo-Dutch War, Dutch and English battleships in miles long formations, unleashed thousands of broadsides in two years of ruinous war before finally a fragile peace. In the decade that followed, the English, tired of civil and religious conflicts, invited their exiled king, Charles II, to return and restore his interrupted monarchy. Upon his restoration, Charles took control of a formidable navy, a navy he believed he could again use against the Dutch to regain his power, prestige, and wealth. - The greater goal of your endeavour is the seizing of Manhattan, so that the Dutch my no longer exercise that trade which they have wrongfully possessed themselves of. - The Dutch leader, Johan De Witt, soon responded. - Authorise you to attack, conquer, and ruin the English everywhere! Charles will have his war! - The short, profitable war Charles wanted, was not the war he got. His first brilliant victory at sea brought the French King Louis XIV into the war on the side of the Dutch. - The French, under Louis XIV, the strongest power in Western Europe, now come in on the Dutch side, and declare war upon Britain, and that means that Charles is back to square one with twice as many enemies as before. - Ships from Louis' navy supplement's De Witt's newly commissioned battle ships, under the command of the Dutch Admiral De Ruyter. De Ruyter had made the crucial decision to adopt the English in line battle tactics. - The English formation, unified, in line, using their big guns. They turned in unison, the whole fleet. - With De Witt's shipbuilding program adding dozens of battleships to the Dutch fleet and training with in-line tactics, the Dutch met the English, once again, in June of 1666 for an epic battle. - These battles are enormous. There's a hundred ships on each side. There are thousands of men involved. The battles go on for hours, and in the case of the four days, you guessed it, four days. - The Dutch drove the English fleet from the sea. The Dutch celebrated their victory in the Four Days Battle, but this victory, just as so many of the earlier English victories at sea, is ephemeral. No sea battle would decisively win a war, if the opposing fleet could sail back to a home port, repair, refit, rearm, and sail again. - Both sides believed that they had done much more damage to the other than they actually had. The Dutch were sure that the English had lost a good 20 or 25 ships, and that the English had been fatally weakened. - But the English had lost only 10 ships. They quickly repair the ships damaged in the Four Days Battle and provision several new, large ships that had been previously sidelined for lack of men. - The crew in a warship in this period comprises enough sailors to man half of the guns. That's going to be at least 500 men. You'll then have at least 100 soldiers up on the upper deck as marines. In the main, they'll be using muskets to repel boarders. This is closed-quarters fighting. - To get full crews, the English navy resorts to a system called impressment, legally sanctioned, where teams of sailors are sent to hijack able-bodied men. - Dear Duke, I am mightily troubled all this morning about men that they have pressed these two last nights. Persons wholly unfit for sea. - We need men. They adapt to the life of the sea. I have lived it. It is not so bad. - But without press money, it is contrary to all course of law. - Are you saying you will not pay them? In war, we have expenses. All are delayed. Pepys, you are the clerk of the navy. Record it and ensure their press money. - It's really very much up to the captain of each individual ship to send a gang to find as many men as he can. Once they get out there, once they go into a tavern, for example, and try to recruit seamen, they're likely to meet a certain amount of opposition, which means that there will be huge, great battles in the street, perhaps, and not just the sailors themselves, but their wives and girlfriend, even their children might get into the a battle with the press gang, as well. - Press gangs usually haunted sea ports, but during war, with severe shortages, even London would get a visit. Sometimes their indiscriminate kidnapping affected the navy itself. - Yeah, how about our own men at the naval office? Pressed by officers of the fleet into the service? Even men on our ordinance ships are pressed while taking powder and cannon shot to the fleet. - Let me know when your men are pressed. - Thank you, your Lordship. It is only that I am troubled by Holmes. - In his secret diary, Pepys describes his personal and professional conflicts with Holmes, worrying that Holmes might challenge him to a duel. - Last evening, at Lord Batton's, he said, in front of several, he thought my wife the fairest to be fair with. - He said that with ladies present? - No, just among the men, but it vexes me all the same. - Do not worry, Pepys. He is gone to the Isle of White in two days. Can you defend your wife, or at least keep her locked up until then? - I can! I hope. - And when the press gangs again act against our common purpose, let me know. - I will. I will. - The impressed crews, over 2,000 men, enable many ships, including the 100-gun first-rate battle ships, to join the fleet. Charles sees the greater fire power of this fleet as a way to reverse his bad fortune. With the expenses of the war mounting, he needs one great, final battle to destroy the Dutch fleet. Less than two months after the Four Days Battle, English and Dutch fleets again sail into the North Sea, both looking for a decisive victory. - The English were the stronger, and the Dutch didn't realise it. The winds were very light, so this was a battle that took place, literally, in slow motion. - St. James Day Battle is classic British naval tactics. Linear combat, fire power, degrade the enemy by bombardment, until the enemy breaks and runs. A French observer on the Dutch ships said, "Look, you'll never beat the English at this" "because they hold a tight line." "They manoeuvre in close quarters." "They're disciplined." - While the English fight to their best tactical advantage, the Dutch make grave tactical errors. De Witt persuades De Ruyter to reserve a few large battleships at the beginning of the battle, a tactic good against a smaller fleet but disastrous against the larger English fleet. And Tromp, ignoring the battle plan to stay in line, breaks ranks to chase after an English squadron. - It became a major defeat for the Dutch navy and De Ruyter. Perhaps the biggest defeat ever live to see. So after the battle, De Ruyter was really angry. - Robertson, you know I should fault De Witt and his policies, but his mettling directions were almost as disastrous as Tromp disappearing. - What directions? We fought the English in line. - He asked me to keep some of our flagships from full engagement at the beginning of the battle, which I agreed to because I thought we would outnumber the English. - But they outnumbered us. - Ha, ha, we were not prepared for that. They refitted their fleet, added new battleships. My friend, I drove the Royal Charles from the line, but another 100-gun battleship took its place! We could not stand it alone with Tromp gone God knows where. - Outnumbered and outgunned, where was Tromp? - Here he comes now with De Witt. I, too, would like to know that. - Tromp, you're back. What happened to you? - Happened? A battle is what happened. - We all agreed to stay in line because we have had some success with this system. Not only were you not in line, but you were nowhere to be seen. - My squadron had the opportunity to take out the entire English Blue Squadron, an opportunity I could not ignore. - But our battle plan was clear. Stay in line. Broadside volleys, tack together, stay together! You, yourself, endorsed this plan and signed it! - I did, but I thought we could take a dozen ships or more, so I went after them. - Where are these ships? - We had not enough time, and after our main fleet retired, their whole fleet came after us. We were fortunate enough to sail around them to home. - Your new battle plan almost proved to be our undoing. With your ships, we could've matched them broadside for broadside, but when you abandoned your position, you left us exposed! We were fortunate to save the fleet! - But we lost only two ships. - Two ships! And thousands of men! Men that need not have been killed! Even more, you cost us the battle! We lost, when we could've won! And now the English control The Channel! - De Ruyter, I know you are angry, but we will refit and rebuild and be ready next season. - Tromp, I want your resignation as soon as possible. - But we can work this together! - You have it now. - De Witt knows that despite his best efforts at reconciliation, his political opponents, the Orangists, the party loyal to William of Orange, will blame him for Tromp's dismissal. Tromp himself is an Orangist, and for the Orangists, Tromp is a hero. And De Witt has other ongoing conflicts with the Orangists. - De Witt has one major problem in his domestic policies, and that is William III. William III is slowly but surely coming of age. The Orangists are, once again, stirring and demanding more rights for William III, and De Witt is trying to postpone this as much as possible, but he knows that at some stage, it would be unavoidable to at least give him something. - But domestic policies can wait. De Witt's crisis now is the war with England. After the St. James Day Battle, Charles' navy is in command of the sea. It can stop any ship from entering or leaving Dutch ports, and the English look for opportunities to damage Dutch commerce. - The English learned from a discontented Dutch captain, that there were storehouses in Vlieland. The English selected Sir Robert Holmes to destroy the Dutch storehouses. - In the anchorage behind it, they find a huge fleet of Amsterdam merchant ships, and they burn the lot. It was reckoned to have been a million pounds worth of losses to the Dutch economy. - Holmes, your raid has destroyed more Dutch ships than all our battles. How many ships burnt? - 150 with a few guard frigates. - And the town? - We found supplies there and took them. Unfortunately, our men began capturing goods from every house and would not return to ship. - How could you get them back in order and boarded? - With the men in such high spirits, there was only one way. We burned the town. With all possible booty going up in flames, they returned to the ship. - And what are you going to call this great victory, Sir Robert. the Vlie Apocalypse? - Nothing quite so fancy, Your Majesty. Simply, Holmes Bonfire. - This is Sir Robert Holmes' great triumph. Holmes's Bonfire, the English called it. It's still remembered in Holland as a great disaster. - Before De Witt can respond to Holmes' escalation of the war on land, a disastrous conflagration destroys the heart of London. The Dutch see it as the hand of God punishing an evil people in retribution for Holmes Bonfire. With over 10,000 buildings destroyed and thousands homeless, The Great Fire of London is a catastrophe on a scale far beyond Holmes Bonfire, and for Charles, a financial fiasco. With the Dutch economy in wholesale shambles and the English capital smoldering, Louis XIV sees an opportunity to assert his tenuous claim to territory near the Dutch border. - Louis XIV has ambitions to strengthen his frontier to the North by annexing large parts of what's now Belgium. It's then The Spanish Netherlands. - In May 1667, Louis XIV finally invaded The Spanish Netherlands, and this was of the utmost importance to Johan De Witt because Johan De Witt would want to maintain The Spanish Netherlands as a buffer between the Dutch Republic and France. - So although Charles II doesn't do anything to force the Dutch to make peace, this advancing French army undoubtedly does. - De Witt soon agrees with Charles to begin negotiations at Breda in the south of Holland. With negotiations underway, Charles plans to exploit the French build up on the Dutch border, as he reviews naval strategy with his brother, James, Duke of York. - James what options have we this season? - Without more funds, the navy will not sail. The men are owed two years' pay and will not sail again without it. The ships need repair and fitting out, but we have no credit with our suppliers. Perhaps Parliament will vote more funds. - They will not. They will only mettle and fuss. They might even hold those funds already voted. But if we hold out in Breda, we'll get a payment from the Dutch to end the war. They feel the hot breath of Louis's army on their southern border. - The English understood the position Johan De Witt was in. He still had this war at hand with the English, when his ally was, in fact, threatening his position. The English negotiated, well, actually, instructed to delay the negotiations as much as they could to put more pressure on De Witt. - We could send some frigates out to raid Dutch merchants in The Channel while protecting our own. - But we have little choice but to lay out our big ships in The Medway. - It is a small risk. With peace so close, the Dutch will not expend a fortune to put their feet to sea for another year. - Charles II is gambling with a bit of French help he's going to be able to pull off acceptable peace terms, but meanwhile Johan De Witt is doing a bit of gambling of his own. - Charles is bankrupt and cannot send his fleet out this season. - We will then blockade him and take all his merchant ships. - Yes, and more. We will attack their fleet as it lies. - But we cannot navigate The Medway. It is treacherous with tides. - We have hired, and I can recommend to you, our English pilots, now in our service, with good knowledge of The Medway. - Though De Witt recruited English pilots as guides, his admirals must still navigate treacherous shoals up river for miles. It will be 10 miles before they reach the big English ships protected by the guns of Upnor Castle, the major fort protecting the fleet. - Are not their forts and defences strong? - Sheerness is unfinished. If we get to Upnor, we will have destroyed a dozen ships already. - But before they get to Upnor, downriver, near Gillingham, the Dutch must breach a formidable barrier spanning The Medway, The Gillingham Chain. In a desperate attempt to protect their unmanned battle fleet, the English have barricaded the river with a thick chain. Supported by four platforms, the chain forms an underwater barrier reinforced by half-sunken ships, cables, and broken timbers. - The English fleet is more dangerous at sea than moored in The Medway, and we have many times boldly fought them there. - But have we not already begun our negotiations at Breda for a truce? And then a treaty? - We have. But this raid will be our best plenipotentiary for peace. - Charles knows his ships are vulnerable. They have no crews, and their cannons are already in storage ashore. - My illness, the fever and the swelling have come back. It might prevent my going. - We need you, De Ruyter. Go as far as you can and hand over to my brother, Cornelis. He will project our plan wisely and well. - Charles soon learns his gamble has failed. The Dutch fleet sails. Charles orders the Duke of Albemarle to command the defense of The Medway. Albemarle deploys guns along the river and moves a few warships to point-blank range at the chain. But the navy that England has depended upon to crush invasions, like the Spanish Armada a century before, still lies immobile and unarmed. While the Dutch fleet, with ten times the firepower of the Spanish Armada, anchors at the entrance to The Medway. The next day, the Dutch sail into The Medway easily destroying the weak defences at Sheerness. But they must still get past the Gillingham Chain. At first, the Dutch fleet is dangerously clogged up at the chain. But needing to break through, one ship after another hurls into the chain but is stopped by the barrier. And withering broadsides. Finally, a ship catches a favourable breeze, builds up speed, rams the chain, and breaks it. With the chain broken, nothing can stop the Dutch. Within minutes, they set fire to the ships at the chain, the last English crews surrender, and the Dutch capture the virtually undefended Royal Charles. News at its loss causes pandemonium in London. - No sooner up, that I hear the sad news confirmed of the Royal Charles, which put me into such a fear that at two hours' warning, I sent my father and my wife into the country by the coach this day with about 1,300 pounds in gold in their night bag. Pray God give them good passage. - One of the Royal Navy's largest and most prestigious battleships, crucial to victories at Lowestoft and St. James, is now in Dutch hands. That night, without crew or cannon for most of the fleet, Albemarle reinforces Upnor Castle with artillery, which he personally commands. The next day, De Ruyter comes in with men of war and fire ships packed with flammable oil and stacks of incendiaries. The war ships anchor in the gauntlet from hell, engaging the fort and the batteries all day and into the night. The Dutch fire ships are now floating fire bombs. Their crews grapple the large English battleships, set them on fire, and leap into lifeboats. On the final day, as Albemarle brings in more heavy guns, the Dutch sail back down The Medway with the Royal Charles. - To capture the fleet flagship. To burn three other big ships was a huge naval victory in itself, but even more than a naval victory, I mean, it would've been one thing if they'd lost those ships in open battle, it would've been bad, but at least it wouldn't have been dishonourable. But to lose them not even properly defended, it was politically catastrophic for the king. - The English were really in no position to delay negotiations any further. The political and economic and financial damage that Charles and his regimen had sustained was enormous. The Dutch, on the other hand, were happy to conclude a peace treaty that would guarantee their trading rights and then take steps to stop Louis XIV from conquering the whole of The Spanish Netherlands. - De Witt wants a quick end to the war. He proposes the two most profitable trading areas, Suriname and Pulo Run, remain Dutch. Suriname and South America for sugar production, Pulo Run in the East Indies for valuable spice monopolies, but to ensure fast response, De Witt sweetens the agreement for Charles by ensuring two areas remain English, Cape Coast Castle, a centre for the slave and ivory trade in Africa, and New York. New York will remain English. - Frankly, the Dutch thought they had bigger economic fish to fry. They were much more concerned with the East Indies and with the West Indies than they were with this tiny and relatively unimportant province where they were losing the demographic battle, in any event, to the English. - Charles now controls the Eastern Seaboard of North America from Carolina to Maine. - So one could say that the defeat in 1667 enabled the British to build their empire in America. - But implanted three years earlier, in surrender terms of the Dutch Director General of New Amsterdam, Stuyvesant, was a crucial guarantee. Freedom of conscience. The inhabitants of New Amsterdam, now New Yorkers, had secured a freedom of religious expression enjoyed nowhere else in America. That guarantee would be explicitly renewed several times in the next century, most visibly in The Bill of Rights of The United States Constitution. The peace after Breda gave both the Dutch and the English the tranquillity they needed to rebuild their economies, but neither could ignore the rampant power of Louis XIV. Charles and De Witt form an alliance with Sweden that forces Louis XIV to withdraw from The Spanish Netherlands. Charles still hated the Dutch, but he wanted to teach Louis XIV a lesson. If Louis wanted to take over The Spanish Netherlands, he needed to partner with Charles. Louis is finally persuaded. - The French now want to fight the Dutch. They think the Dutch are becoming a nuisance to them, and it's necessary to annihilate them. Charles thinks that everything has changed, everything that made him lose the last time is now gone. - This time, Charles will have Louis XIV as an ally, using his massive army against the Dutch. After preliminary diplomacy, they negotiate an alliance through Charles' sister, Henrietta. - Princess Henrietta, Duchess of Orleans, was, in fact, the youngest sister of King Charles II, and Princess Henrietta's husband was the younger brother of Louis XIV. So it was younger brother marries younger sister. They're first cousins, dynastic marriage, and Princess Henrietta and her husband weren't very happy together, and they tried to give her something of a life, making her a diplomat, and they sent her to England in 1670 to Dover Castle to meet her brother, who was 14 years older, in order to negotiate a treaty on behalf of Louis XIV. Louis wanted to invade and overtake The Spanish Netherlands, and he wanted the agreement that he would do this by land, and that Charles II, who had already fought the Dutch, would do the same by sea, and in return, Louis would give Charles II a lot of much-needed cash, but also there was a secret clause, which was that Charles II had to promise to become Roman Catholic. - Charles himself is pretty broad minded where religion is concerned. Parliament, on the other hand, wants to have a thoroughly intolerant national church, which forces everybody to worship in it or get arrested. - While Charles disliked Parliament's harsh religious policies, he did not flirt with Catholicism to promote religious toleration. He wanted financial support from Louis XIV, and to get it, he would promise leniency for English Catholics, and he would even promise to become Catholic himself. - My dearest, I again, thank you for your good counsel. We have come a long way from our treaty with the Dutch and Swedes. - You were right to secure your kingdom then. Louis' cold answer was as good as a refusal, but now the league between you and Louis is so durable that nothing in the world shall divide your majesties. - And it was you who convinced him of my resolve to declare myself Catholic, and to be reconciled to the church of Rome. Without the aid of the most Christian king, we would not be able to fulfil this design. - We must, of course, keep the whole matter an absolute secret. Only those that you trust can even know of our plans for the Dutch. - Many understand that a war with Holland would, in all respects, suit with the interests of England. - And we can ensure our nephew, William, that he will be compensated for any of his losses? - William will be as glad as ourselves to see De Witt gone. Ah! What comes here? - Henrietta took with her, her maid of honor, Louise de Kéroualle, and the treaty was meant to take five days. In fact, they had such a jamboree at Dover Castle, because everybody was there, that the treaty, the time, extended to 14 days. It was a huge party. When the time came to leave, the king, and his sister, Princess Henrietta, dreaded saying goodbye, and the princess asked Louise to bring her jewel box to the king. - Now Charles, what would you like from my jewelry box? - This is the jewel I covet. - Louise and the princess set off back to France, and Louise was then invited to the English Court, and the King of France, Louis XIV, wanted to send her because he wanted to discover if his cousin, Charles II, was really going to become Catholic, and the only way to have a proper spy was a spy in the bedchamber. - In the treaty, Charles got what he wanted most from Louis, money, hundreds of thousands of pounds for the navy. Enough to refit his 60 biggest ships and an advance payment of 160,000 pounds for declaring himself Catholic at some unspecified future time. - It's a rather nice example of Charles II's layers of deviousness actually. If there's one thing that will blow his credit sky high, it's the announcement that he's going to turn himself a Catholic. But he didn't, but what if Louis XIV decides to reveal it? - So the plan is for a surprise attack in which the British attack the Dutch from the sea, and the French attach from the land. Also, Charles believes that with this overwhelming victory, he'll be so rich on captured Dutch colonies and Dutch shipping, it'll make him stronger at home. He won't have to ask Parliament for money again. - Charles wants independence from Parliament at home, and through his nephew, William of Orange, a controlling influence on the Dutch state. - What Charles hopes to have happen as a result of the Treaty of Dover is to overturn the Dutch Republic and promote his nephew, William of Orange, to be Stadtholder and Captain General of The Netherlands. - As Charles begins his Dutch strategy to replace De Witt, his nephew, William III, at first is receptive. - Your Majesty, dear uncle Charles. Let me know your desires, and I am confident that as long as they are not hostile to the foundations of this republic, I shall be able to obtain them for you, in spite of De Witt, who will be thereby worsted while I and my friends, in whom His Majesty can place his trust, will be placed at the helm. - But during a visit later that year, Charles attempts to persuade William to become Catholic. William vehemently rejects Charles' proposal. Becoming Catholic would betray his religion and his country. With William so agitated, Charles decides to keep his grand schemes with Louis XIV secret. - The problem for the Dutch Republic is that the traditional leaders of the Dutch Army were the members of the House of Orange. So building up a land army meant giving political power and military power to his political enemies. So what De Witt hoped to do was to have an incredibly powerful navy and the triple alliance which he thought would keep France contained. So he was completely double crossed and outmanoeuvred by Charles II. - De Witt's weak army policy, whatever the motivation, is now his greatest political liability. He can no longer ignore Orangist demands to mobilise an army, an army that William III will now command. He invites William, De Ruyter, and his brother, Cornelis into his war cabinet. - The question is not will there be war, but how soon? - Avchen has already beaten off an English attack on the Smirnoff convoy. - It's Charles' way of declaring war. He even sent Robert Holmes to lead the attack, to make certain we would understand what he meant. - The English declaration will come in the next month. - Our ambassadors report rumours of a French treaty. - When I visited Charles last, he denied it, but Louis's army contradicts that now, 80,000 infantry, 25,000 cavalry marching on Maastricht. - That is not a training exercise. The French also will declare soon. - The French outnumber our troops three to one. When Munster and Cologne invade, our disadvantage will be four to one. - Our only hope is to split their alliance. De Ruyter, take the fleet and attack the English as soon as possible. The French will not engage. If we can sting the English, they will hate their allies. Roche, send ambassadors to Louis and offer land and money. 15 million gilded if need be to stay his attack. William, mobilise as large an army as possible. Prepare the sluices. See if we can hold at any fort or line and reinforce it. Louis will not take our first offer. Gentlemen, we must be ready for a bad year. Cornelis! You know we will be blamed. The Orangist pamphlets call for our heads already, and we're not even at war. Take care. - De Witt knows the Orangists want him and his brother gone. And he also knows that a few of them may resort to violence. But he still hopes for an early naval victory, as the war begins in the spring of 1672. - 1672 for the Dutch Republic, what we call The Rampjaar, The Year of Disaster. The country is invaded from the south by France, from the east by city states of Munster and Cologne in Germany, and from the west, threatened by the combined allied fleets of the English and French. - So the Dutch are literally on their knees. This army is coming in almost unopposed, and even if it was opposed, it was the best, the biggest army in Europe. They're coming from the south at the same time that the navy is occupied at sea. The Third Anglo-Dutch War is very different to the previous two. It's not so much a war about trade. It's war of conquest. The declared objective of the allies, and by the allies I'm talking about England and France, is to literally wipe out the Dutch state. That's what they intend to do. - In a desperate attempt to save the Dutch Republic, De Witt has sent his best admiral, De Ruyter, to attack the combined Anglo-French fleet. This fleet, sailing under the command of James, Duke of York, is the most powerful battle-fleet yet assembled. At daybreak, near Solebay, De Ruyter finds the combined English and French fleet at its most vulnerable, anchored and loading supplies. As the Dutch close in, the French squadron sails south as planned earlier with the Duke of York. De Ruyter now sees his chance for victory. He sends his smallest squadron to block the French and concentrates his larger squadrons on the English, who are now outnumbered. As they sail north, the English are trapped between land, the superior Dutch force, blasting them from windward, and just ahead, Red Sand Shoals. In utter desperation, the English tack away from the shoals and directly into a massive melee with the more numerous Dutch. The Dutch inflict heavy damage on the English fleet, including the Royal James, one of the largest of the English first-rate 100-gun ships, which they board, capture, and burn. As the larger French fleet sails back toward the battle, De Ruyter collects his fleet and sails into the North Sea with one of his greatest victories. De Ruyter's fleet inflicts so much damage on the English fleet that it eliminates the possibility of an Anglo-French invasion by sea for the rest of the year. But on land, the Dutch Year of Disaster continues unabated. Louis XIV's army advances virtually unopposed through the eastern Dutch provinces to the boarders of Holland and Zeeland. De Witt, blamed for the catastrophe, rapidly loses the last vestige of political support and resigns. William III takes over the command of all Dutch forces and organises their last desperate stand. - William III now was Stadtholder and commander of the army, and the only way the republic was going to survive was to flood the whole area, from the big rivers to the middle of The Netherlands. So they flooded it. The French could still have crossed if they had realised what was happening, but by the time they tried to cross, the water was to the depth of the horses' necks and they couldn't get their army across. - The Dutch situation really was desperate. They are still politically heavily divided, and as this war unfolds, the Orangists get more and more powerful, and in the middle of the war, De Witt and his brother are thrown out of power, lynched by an Orangist mob, and hideously murdered. - Johan De Witt, the bold, intelligent, patriotic leader of the Dutch for two decades, is dead. He stopped a war the Dutch could not win, the first English war, and was the architect of the peace they did win after the second war. He made the cumbersome Dutch Federal system work, while preserving their hard-won personal and religious freedoms. It was a horrific death for a national hero, at the hands of a mindless mob. - Our deepest sympathy with you Michiel. The De Witts were your dear friends and comrades, and they always placed their trust in you. Johan was my mentor too, and I only wish he were here, to counsel this in this perilous time. - No one would ever prove William III's complicity in De Witt's death. The fate of the nation now rests with his leadership. He is ready to take charge and has a strategy for survival. - Can you mend with Tromp here? - Mend with must. Our enemies beset us. - I will follow you, Admiral, and obey. - We must take the English out of the war, and soon. - We can strike before they expect us. - And the French will not fight. Louis will order them to stand off and watch, while the English and us grind each other. - Good, if you can stop the English from landing a force this year, we can survive on land south and east, with God's help and protection. Tromp, De Ruyter, the eyes and hearts of all the inhabitants of his country, indeed, of all the Christian world, follow your fleet. Evertsen, Charles, my uncle, speaks of you with affection. He calls you "Kees the Devil". - He was gracious to me just before the last war. Released me after capture because our family was kind to him during his exile. - Evertsen, we need you with De Ruyter again this season, but when it ends, you will have a special commission, to seize the English East Indies convoy as it returns. - Where? - Near their base at St. Helena on the South Atlantic. - And if I miss there? - Go west to America, and do what damage you can. - At the end of the year, Evertsen's expedition sails, but it has the misfortune of running into a more powerful English fleet at Cape Verde. The larger English fleet blocks Evertsen from the South Atlantic. So he sets sail for America. Approaching Martinique, he sees a fleet on the horizon. - And as he closed with it, he prepared for battle and was relieved when this other fleet of six ships raised the State's General's flag. He had blundered by sheer fortune into another fleet from Holland from the Admiralty of Amsterdam. - The Dutch fleets combined to raid English plantations in America. - The expeditions were very successful. They leapfrogged up the island chain, destroyed a large piece of the English tobacco fleet, and decided to sail on. - Their next stop is New York. - We arrived off Manhattan at the end of July and met with a Dutch delegation from Brooklyn and Vlissingen. They pleaded with us to restore their government. We dispatched a sloop to the commander of the English fort with a demand for his immediate surrender. They responded arrogantly, asking by whose authority we made our demand? I told them, "You can see by our ships "and our flags who we are." "Our commission issues from the barrels of our cannons." With no word from them, we loaded our marines into boats to land, about 600, and began to shell the fort. After an hour, they raised a white flag. - While Evertsen sets up a new government in New Netherland, the war across The Atlantic continues. Charles needs a victory. The war now in its second year is unpopular. Dutch privateers decimate English trade. Parliament reluctantly votes funds to continue but will not support another year of war without a decisive victory. In addition, Parliament passes an act requiring all high office holders to swear an oath condemning Catholicism. Unwilling to submit to the oath, James, Duke of York, resigns from the navy, leaving Charles with Prince Rupert to command the fleet for the planned invasion of The Netherlands. - This time, the English want to invade Holland themselves. They actually have an invasion army ready to go across. They have boats to go across, and this time, the Anglo-French fleet is meant to support that invasion. - But the invasion cannot take place until the Anglo-French fleet knocks out De Ruyter's fleet. - All summer, De Ruyter very skillfully kept his smaller fleet behind his own shoals and avoided a major battle. I mean, a couple of smaller conflicts. In August, De Ruyter has come out to escort in the returning East India fleet. - The large Anglo-French fleet sails in battle line to destroy De Ruyter. But their formation soon falls apart. - The rear squadron dropped back to fight the Dutch admiral of the rear squadron, Tromp. The French do very little all day, and, of course, it's said that they've been under orders from Louis XIV not to fight, to let the English and the Dutch hammer it out. So Prince Rupert's squadron in the centre is left on its own against De Ruyter's squadron. As a result, the Dutch achieve their objective. They keep the control of the sea, and Rupert has to retire back to Britain, with the inevitable recriminations afterwards, the accusations against the French, accusations against Rupert himself. - The English Parliament has constantly opposed fighting on the side of the French. With political pressure from all sides, and insufficient subsidies from Louis, Charles agrees to peace with his nephew, William. - My captains, I applaud you, as do our thankful people. With this treaty, England departs the war. - We have taken Charles off the French payroll and put him on ours, at 20% of what he demanded less than a year ago! - Evertsen will be unhappy we returned New Amsterdam, and saluting their flag always stuck in my throat. - But for a small indemnity and a point of etiquette, we can save our country from Louis's grasp. Neither Zeeland nor Holland wanted New Amsterdam. It could not be held profitably. - The English duplicate themselves so quickly, like rabbits. Soon their whole colony will suffocate under the small turds of their Anglo babies. - Since the whole war had been fought at sea, it was easy to make peace on the terms of no gains on either side. The idea of New York did cross some people's minds, but the Dutch weren't terribly interested. They had bigger fish to fry, in economic terms, in other parts of the world. - We yield New Amsterdam, but we gain clear title to Suriname and four sugar islands and rights to many fisheries, and I am, of course, Charles's favourite again. He writes, "I would have you know that although" "my own affairs oblige me to hasten the peace," "I could not have had any comfort nor security" "in it, if it did not see you so established." - There's talk of James's daughter for you. So who can tell? - Yes, you might be the next King of England. - William now has supreme command of both army and navy, as well as the highest civil office in every province. He builds alliances with Spain and Austria and leads large allied armies to lift the French siege of Dutch cities. He wisely lets De Ruyter continue his extraordinary command of the navy. Winning victor after victory against all odds, De Ruyter assures his place among the great naval commanders in the history of the world. Meanwhile, Charles attention is drawn to domestic concerns. - We'll never know quite how much influence Charles's girlfriends had. One of the most apparently influential was Barbara Villiers Castlemayne. She's certainly got a temper, and she's certainly got plenty of ambition, and the king dotes on her. He's in love with her all through the 1660s. - Pepys, see there, my competitor for the king's affection. Louis' spy and whore. - No, she can no longer serve Louis now. Charles makes her an English Duchesse. - Duchess! Or is that now the title for a whore with a high price? - The king will soon acknowledge her son and establish a living for him. - As he did mine, after I threatened to bash our baby's brains out. - Right here at Whitehall, during a ball, as I remember. You have flair, my lady. Ah, here comes The Duke of York. - Yes, he beats the bushes for a new wife. - It was James, Duke of York, who was the key to William III's future as king. James gave his daughter, Mary, in marriage to William, and as important, James publicly announced himself Catholic soon after his first wife died. - Oh here also comes Charles and his French whore. I leave you with them. - The girlfriend of Charles II who was really hated by the English and suspected of being massively influential, was the one he had all through the 1670s and until his death. Louise de Kéroualle, who he makes Duchess of Portsmouth. - James, I have for you the perfect match. Mademoiselle Delboeuf, the daughter of the Duke. - How does she compare to the widow of the Duke de Guise? She is De Guise's opposite. Young, pretty, smart, without the baggage of a large fortune of her large family. - But James still needs a large fortune. I was feeding the birds at St. James's Park, attended only by Lord Berkeley. James rode up surrounded by his guards. The Duke feared my life might be endangered by so small attendants. "What kind of danger, James?" Said I. For no man in England would end my life to make you king. - Charles II died of natural causes in 1685. His legacy, Charles created the Royal Navy, the cornerstone of British global dominance for the next two centuries. He acquired trading posts in New York and Africa that ensured England access to the wealth of two continents, sidestepping an obstinate parliament, he secured religious freedom for his new colonies in America, the Carolinas, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. And for his brother, James, he delivered the British throne intact. - James II, of course, was a Catholic, and to be a Catholic in a Protestant nation at this date is an exceedingly difficult trick to pull off. - James is not just a Catholic. He's an authoritarian. He wants to impose his will on the country, and that combination of his Catholicism and his authoritarianism leads to a revolt. - With a large part of the English nation disaffected with James, William III led a Dutch invasion of England. An extremely risky undertaking. But with broad support in England, including the English Army and Navy, William's bold move was successful. William and his wife, Mary, James' daughter, became the King and Queen of England. - William III is a Dutchman, and he brings with him Dutch ideas about finance and capital and about the modern state. Under William III, England goes from a ram shackled, poor country to a remarkably rich and resilient country capable of fighting for decades. - He combines the English and Dutch forces into a large coalition against Louis XIV. This is then the theme for the decades to come. - It's William's constitutional state that gives you the great power of the 18th Century, which allows the Royal Navy to be wielded effectively by a much richer and more powerful state. So it's not about the navy. The navy is fine under James and Charles. It's the state that needs reforming. That comes in 1688, and after that, you can date the rise of England to global power. - William III also extended religious freedom by ramming a Toleration Act through parliament. Although it proscribed English monarchs from being Catholic and restricted some religious practises, the Toleration Act virtually eliminated arbitrary religious persecution by the state. A hard-won victory for freedom of conscience and religion in England and in all of her American colonies.
