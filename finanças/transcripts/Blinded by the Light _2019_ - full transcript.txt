September 1980. My best friend Matt and I have the same birthday. He got a brand-new chopper bike. It's really fast and looks so cool. I got a Rubik's Cube. But Matt gave me this diary that he didn't want. And I'm going to write in it every day. The Russians have been in Afghanistan for 363 days. "Baggy Trousers" by Madness is my favorite song. Matt. I can't wait to go to London together. Look at all the people going there. Yeah. They wanna come up the motorway at Luton. - Come on. - Yeah. Hop on. - You're on? - Yeah. - Let's go. - Whoo-hoo! - This is brilliant, Matt! - Whoo-hoo! We're gonna be best friends forever! Coronation chicken next week. Great. Nice one. Thanks. Yeah, I'll see you later. Javed. There you go, Javed, son. Goodbye, cheese and pickle. My summer job is done! The Cold War rages on. Reagan and Thatcher are still number one. But I'm stuck in Luton, one of the herd, no fun, freedom or future.

You muppet. - How was Ibiza? - Oh, mate, wicked. Met Emma over there. She's from St. Albans. - Works in HMV. - All right? All right? I just finished work. I'm writing you a new song for your band. - It's about the Cold War. - Javed writes all the time. You know? Like, diaries, poems. He even wrote one about Bo Derek once. And he sent it to her. And I wrote some of your best essays, too. Remember? Yeah. Pet Shop Boys got the best number one this year so far. I told you, mate. Listen. Synths are the future. Anyway... happy birthday, mate. Got it at the airport. You know? It's a fertility symbol from the Balearics. Thanks. You know, I thought it might, er... help you pick up a bird one day, maybe. - He's never had a girlfriend before, so... - Hey? Is that against your religion? No. Thanks, Matt. - I'll see you later, mate. - See you later. He's missing out. What are they doing? Oh, my God! How can you be friends with that boy? No shame at all. I didn't move out of Bury Park to see this. You should tell him this is very bad. Very bad behavior in a good neighborhood. Dad, he's English. Your sister's coming. Get the shopping out of the car. Matt's back, then? He's torturing me with his perfect life. Go on, my son! All right, J? I taught him all he knows. All the moves. Very nice to meet you, Princess Emma. There you go, sweetheart... 19 pounds... 50 pence. I'll drop another 30 dresses off to you tomorrow morning. Oh! Lucky you, having such a helpful family. Look at this! Oh! My kids treat my place like a hotel. I'll tell you something, you've done something right, turning kids out like that. - Ta, sweetheart. - Goodbye. Javed. September 3rd, 1987. My dad is stuck in another century. He treats me like I'm six, not sixteen. Javed, beta, come! We're ready for your party. Oh. He's coming. Happy birthday. Time to smarten up. You're not a kid anymore, Javed. Thanks... girls. Not girls. Sisters. Come on. Let's light the candle. Yasmeen, photo. Say cheese. Make a wish, beta. Make loads of money, kiss a girl, get out of this dump. You were supposed to be writing a pop song. Who writes songs about nuclear war and Thatcher, anyway? You write about depressing things. Like, you haven't got any money, or you can't watch Rocky on telly. That's not true. I write about politics and Reaganomics... Oh, Javed. Javed, Javed. You spent four years, mate, going on about your bloody dad who wouldn't let you have an Acorn Electron with a 32-kilobyte RAM. It also had a 32-kilobyte ROM. Yeah, well, I can't really sing about you and your dad. Can I? Is he making you do A Levels as well? No. I'm doing it for me. I want to go to college. Getting good A Levels will get me into university. That's my only ticket out of here, mate. It's 4:00 a.m. in New York, 4:00 p.m. in Tokyo and 9:00 a.m. right here in Luton. You're listening to Radio Luton, the official radio station for Luton Sixth Form College. I'm Colin Hand, the hand that rocks the turntable, with the first lesson of a new year and the subject, "Lessons in Love." ♪ I'm not proud, I was wrong And the truth... ♪ First day. Start at the top and stay there. Study hard, so you don't have to work in a factory like me all your life. Yes, Dad. If you want to succeed, look for the Jews in your class. Do what the Jews do. They're very successful people. I think that's a bit racist, Dad. It's the truth. Oh, hi! Hey. You're here to study, OK? I'll find you a wife in good time. You leave that to me. And remember... stay away from the girls! - Follow the Jews! - Er? What?

Did I break it? - Who's that? - The Boss. - Whose boss? - The boss of us all. I'm really late. I missed the bus. I wasn't sure about the route either. Right. Everyone in? My name is Miss Clay, and I want to know why you're here. Anybody? To pass me exams, miss. Well, thanks to Maggie Thatcher, even if you do pass your exams and get a degree, there'll be few jobs waiting for you. So, what I want to make this class about is figuring out where you stand. What you think. The writers that we'll be studying this year are immortal. Their themes are universal. Shakespeare, Dickens, Woolf. Who here... wants to live forever, like them? Who here wants to be a writer? Miss Clay? - Yes... erm...? - Er, Eliza. Isn't the job of a writer to... make a difference? - You know, to change the world? - Yes. Yes, that's a start. The writers I admire make a difference. They tell the world something that it needs to hear. What's your name again? Javed. Javed, you put your hand up earlier, and then you put it down. Um... Miss Clay... I've been writing poems and a diary since I was about ten. But it's really not that interesting. Then why do you do it? I don't know. To put down my thoughts, I guess. You see, in my house, no one's allowed opinions except my dad. - What would you like, love? - Chips and beans, please. - There you go, love. - Thank you. ♪ Oh, I just died in your arms tonight ♪ ♪ It must have been something you said ♪ ♪ I just died in your arms tonight ♪ This place is bad. It's the United Nations of kicking tribes. You've got goths, a Salt-N-Pepa crew, there's Wham! boys, Bananarama girls and... and there's Eliza. Smart, sassy... and a politico fighting to free Nelson Mandela. And then there's me. I don't have a tribe. Oi. Bilal No-Mates. All right? What are you writing? Nothing. An essay? Already? - Are you a swot or something? - No. Just a diary. So... tell me about the Boss. Bruce is the direct line to all that's true in this shitty world. - Seriously? - Mm. What does he know about our world? Guard these with your life, yeah? You can thank me later. A boy spat at me today... after he wrote his filth on the wall. This time, I tried not to run. This time, I tried to stand tall and say, "I'm not scared, you stupid clown." You're not better than me. This is also my hometown." Stand up to him. Why do you run? Face the pathetic NF scum. You're better than this. - Where's Matt? - He's a bit... busy. Emma! Why are you answering the door just wearing that? - You all right, mate? - Yeah. Uh... Got my lyrics, then? That's what I came round to say. I'm working on it. Ah. You still coming to my party tonight? - Yeah, of course. - Good. Emma's mates are coming, and I know one who would be perfect for you. - She's not fussy. - Really? - Yeah. - Cheers. I promise this time I'll come. How many times I have to tell you? Pakistanis do not go to parties. I thought I was British. You do not know this country like I do, huh? Do you remember Enoch Powell? They will never accept you, beta. Matt accepts me. Listen to me. You're very lucky. You will always be Pakistani. You will never be British. ♪ Pump up the volume, pump up the volume ♪ ♪ Pump up the volume, dance, dance ♪ - Whoo! - Cheers! Scott. Scott! - OK, wait. - Again? Wait for your mother. After three. One, two, three, push! OK, everyone to the back now! Push the car! OK, one, two, three, push! Let's go! Come on, come on, get in! Let's go! Great neighborhood, Mr. Shah. We are the first Pakistanis on this street. Remember when we came in the '70s? - Luton was a good town then. - Ah. Today, there are too many Pakistanis. I need your help again for a new mortgage application. This is next door? It's for my eldest. He's getting married soon. Oh! Congratulations. Mubarak, Mr. Shah! He doesn't know it yet. But he's a good boy. He does what I say. Ah. Did you hear that? Dear, get samosa for Mr. Malik and for Javed... Well done. - Let's do the Paki house. - Thank you, ji. - Eh! What are you doing? - He's doing a wee-wee. Aim it down on the carpet. - Hooligan boy. - It's a wee-wee delivery. Pissing on the Pakis! - What is happening here? - Wee-wee, all on my carpet. Clean it quickly, come on. Quickly. - Please. - Just the young kids are just playing. Smelly, smelly Pakis! It's OK. That's why we have this plastic here. I cleaned your floor for you. Don't let the wee go on the carpet. Pakis! Javed. Not what you expected? This is your third essay for me. - I'm beginning to understand you and... - I write poems too, Miss. That's why I thought I understood the assignment. That brief section about the Indian soldiers missing home and cooking their own food in the trenches, that was amazing. That was your voice. I wanted more. Tell me about your poems. They're crap, Miss. Yeah, but they're your crap. And if you keep at it, one day you might think they're not crap. I want to write for the paper. We're not really looking for new writers at the moment. I like to write, and I want to learn. I could show you some of my work. I'd rather you didn't. - I could show you some of my poems. - I... really don't wanna read them. Beti, I'm so happy. They have found a boy. - And he's definitely not a taxi driver? - No, beti. He's a graduate. - MA from the University of Rawalpindi. - I want to ask more overtime... Vauxhall Motors are cutting a thousand jobs. They're trying to reduce their operating costs by a quarter. Staff will be cut at their factories in Luton and Ellesmere Port. The company says an early retirement scheme for workers over 55 should bring the present workforce of 12,500 down by the required amount, but the unions say they believe more redundancies may be necessary. Vauxhall, General Motors' existing car-making subsidiary in this country... What are they saying? Vauxhall's laying off half the workforce. Dad's job. No, beta. He's been there for 16 years. Double shift, night shift, whatever they wanted. Of more than 50 adults, just four have jobs. The average period of unemployment is nine years. Vauxhall dumped Dad like an old, disused engine. Tell me. Dear General Motors, Let me speak from the heart. You took my dad's job And you tore my family apart. I'll have to stop studying And Mum will need to work faster. My life now is a total disaster. I want to escape this depressing town. Is that such a crime? How useless am I, sitting here, Trying to make words rhyme? Earlier on today, apparently a woman rang the BBC and said she heard that there was a hurricane on the way. Well, if you're watching, don't worry, there isn't. But having said that, actually the weather will become very windy. You OK, J? What's gonna happen to us? - Javed? - I don't know but writing crap poems doesn't help anyone. - Don't say that. - You and me, Shazia, we were born at the wrong time, in the wrong town, in the wrong town, in the wrong family. ♪ I get up in the evening ♪ ♪ And I ain't got nothing to say ♪ ♪ I come home in the morning ♪ ♪ I go to bed feeling the same way ♪ ♪ I ain't nothing but tired ♪ ♪ Man, I'm just tired and bored With myself ♪ ♪ Hey there, baby ♪ ♪ I could use just a little help ♪ ♪ You can't start a fire... ♪ ♪ Messages keep getting clearer ♪ ♪ Radio's on And I'm moving round my place ♪ ♪ I check my look in the mirror ♪ ♪ Wanna change my clothes My hair, my face ♪ ♪ Man, I ain't getting nowhere ♪ ♪ I'm just living in a dump like this ♪ ♪ There's something happening somewhere ♪ ♪ Baby, I just know that there is ♪ ♪ You can't start a fire ♪ ♪ You can't start a fire without a spark ♪ ♪ This gun's for hire ♪ ♪ Even if we're just dancing In the dark... ♪ Hey!

My poems. Did you fish them out of a bin? I did throw them away last night. But then I changed my mind. They're not brilliant, but they're mine. Roops! Roops! I listened to everything. Both tapes. I'm telling you, I could feel it all right here. It's like Bruce knows everything I've ever felt, everything I've ever wanted. I mean, "Sometimes I feel so weak, I just wanna explode. Explode and tear this whole town apart. Take a knife and cut this pain from my heart." I didn't know music could be like that. I mean, "Is a dream a lie if it don't come true? Or is it something worse?" Congratulations. You've popped your Bruce cherry. You never forget your first time. I wrote something. Did I ask you to write something? I had to write it. It's about music. A record review. Sort of. Can you read it? "It's a town full of losers and I'm pulling out of here to win." "Thunder Road... Springsteen." No one listens to Springsteen anymore. He's history. Can you just read it?

I'm really disappointed in you. You hated my poems... I hated that you threw them away before anyone ever read them. - You read them? - Every one of them. Even "Luton Is A Four-Letter Word"? Yeah. And I can think of several more four-letter words for Luton too. But the point is they're raw, they're distinctive. You have a responsibility to make this invisible, this absent voice, heard. But you're my teacher, Miss. Do you really think anyone else would be interested? - I'm interested. - See? Stop doubting. Keep writing. My dad doesn't even know I'm doing English. He thinks I'm doing economics. This is about what you want. You have a gift, Javed. You could be a writer if you put the work in. Really? Me? Bruce Springsteen is not some romantic, faraway figure who sings about romantic, faraway things. He's a local boy, and the things he deals in are things they recognize only too well. Well, he's one of us, you know. He's part of New Jersey. We call him the Boss, and he is the Boss. There was an exuberance, let's say, about something like "Born to Run." The songwriting seems to have become more concerned with rather bleak matters. Lately, I guess, mainly I've just tried to scale it down to what I feel. Life sizes, you know. My sister, she got married when she was really young. My brother-in-law was a construction worker, and then they stopped building buildings, you know, when we had the recession. They just went through a lot of real hard times. You know, they had a couple of kids. You know, that was hard to do. And I guess if I had any heroes now, they'd be like, you know, like them, or... You know, people who keep the world... turning.

Mr. Evans... writing is my son's hobby. He didn't mean to offend you. I'm sure of that. Javed, say sorry. Forty-eight years ago, I marched into war with my friends to fight men in swastikas. Today, I see swastikas on young men on the streets of Luton. That was a very brave poem, young man. You must write more and get your message out. NF scum indeed. Wow. He liked my poem. Why are you writing rubbish? Excuse me. Did you read it? - I did. - And? It wasn't really a review, was it? It was more like a thousand words of closely argued adulation. I know I can do better. Set them out nicely. - You're a Muslim, aren't you? - Yeah. A Pakistani into Springsteen? Now, that's got potential. Sharpen the opening and I'll run it. Yes! Thirteen bundles. That's 130. Um, 50 pence a pop. I owe you... 65 quid. Lovely. Same again for next week? My wife wants 20 bundles. Well, I mean, that's... that's more than double what she did last week. Twenty is too much. Yasmeen, Javed, help her. Blimey. We can do 20 bundles. Yasmeen can help. The children can help. I can help. Yasmeen works! Javed and Shazia have studies. I have been working till twelve, one in the morning. It's too much. Electricity bill. Telephone bill. Rates. Gas bill. Yasmeen is getting married. Shazia will be next. We need the money. What about all the work you do helping people at the masjid? Why don't you ask them to pay you? I cannot do that. You spend time looking at houses you can't buy, sort out your friends' mortgages. And what do you get out of that? What will people say, huh, if they thought I was doing it for the money? There. So... what are we doing? - Hm. - Right, 20 it is. OK, I'll go and get another seven, yeah? Javed. You are my only son. I need you to do more. But, Dad, there's no jobs out there. We have to try, beta.

Except my sister, Shazia. Well, it's good to not fit in. If you did, you'd never want to leave home. I've applied to Manchester. Cause of the Smiths? Cause it's four hours from Luton. I'm not sure if I'll be able to go. My dad's on the dole, goes to the job center every day in his suit. I kind of feel selfish thinking about going off to uni when he'll be struggling at home. Well, you can't live your life for your dad. You don't know many Pakistanis, do you? We only live for our parents. You lot all go off and leave home. We do the opposite. Talking of which, I should probably get going. Bye. So... that's the end of our first date?

You kissed her. Yeah! But wait. Is... Is she a Bruce fan? Not yet but I'm working on it. There are 600 people like Eliza in this college who know nothing about the real Bruce. We have to do something about that. Come on. You want a radio show? Yes. We have an Asian music show already, so... We don't wanna do an Asian show. What? Just cause we're a couple of Pakis, you think we'd be asking to play more Bhangra? So, what do you want? A show that plays only Bruce Springsteen. Nothing but Springsteen? That's your idea? Bruce has a lot to say to students in this college. How will they know there's something better out there if they don't hear it? Look at the calendar over there, the Cutting Crew one. Can you see what year it is? It's 1987. My job is to play music that the students will connect to, yeah? That means Bros. That means Curiosity. And, yes, that even means Debbie Gibson. But Springsteen... he's more what your dad listens to. Not my dad. - Hey. - Hey. - All right? - Yeah. Kevin, move up. - Hi. - Hey. I liked my poem this morning. I couldn't sleep. Was it another gem from Bruce? No. It's mine. You wrote that for me? Javed... your article on how Springsteen inspires you... Too much adulation? It was personal, passionate.

Witnesses say two men were seen climbing up the minaret this morning to place the pig's head before morning prayer. - Understandably, - I should go. - the community are up in arms - Sorry. and the police are doing all they can to support them in light of this shocking event. This incident comes the same day as the extreme right National Front has announced their plan for a march through the streets of Luton. No date for the march has been confirmed yet, but all police leave has been cancelled. Well, I hope we're all hungry. I had hoped Eliza might change for dinner but can't have it all. - Mum, stop fussing. - Right... Ah. - Garlic bread. - Oh, lovely. - Here we all are. - Good. Lovely. So where shall we sit, darling? Um, well, why don't I go at the head here? - And, Francis, you go there. - I'll pop here. Yes, that's it. And then you go either side. Sit yourself down. I'll just place the garlic bread... - On the table. - ...here. - Lovely. - Oh, it is so lovely to meet you. Eliza's very picky on who she brings home. Yes, she picks the boys she thinks we're going to find the most shocking. Politics. It's very personal for our Eliza. Isn't it, Princess? The only thing shocking, Dad, is your bigotry towards anybody who isn't white, middle-class and true blue. You'll have to forgive Eliza. Sometimes I'm not sure how we raised such a firebrand. Do you remember the one with the eyeliner and the daisies? He so wanted to be Morrissey. Then there was the colored fellow with the dreadlocks. - No one says "colored" anymore, Dad. - No? With Eliza, it's the more provocative the better. Well, what's provocative about Javed? Hmm. Javed doesn't drink. He's a Muslim. It's against their religion, Dad. Well, have a little bit, see how you go. We won't tell anyone if you don't. Right. You broke into the college radio station, and you played a record of your choice. We're very sorry, Miss. You see my problem, don't you? Please don't expel us. I need my A levels. Yeah... Yeah, we're very sorry, Miss. So, what I'm going to do... You will promise... promise, never to do it again, and that, I hope, will be the end of that. Is that it? They vandalized my studio! They scratched my Tiffany record! Oh, please, Colin. Tiffany?

Welcome to a very special evening, celebrating the very best of Luton Sixth Form College. Please do stay around afterwards for a reception. The Chardonnay and Twiglets will be flowing. And now I would like to begin with Javed Khan reading an extract from "A Runaway American Dream in Luton." Exciting. Whoops. Dad, listen to this, yeah? Thanks. Bruce Springsteen was, to quote the album he is most famous for, born in the USA, but he has fans around the world, including me. I was not born in the USA, and I grew up not in Asbury Park, New Jersey, but Bury Park, Luton. But the reason I connected with Springsteen is because what he sings about and champions are not only American values but are the best of human values. He talks about working hard and holding on to your dreams and not letting the hardness of the world stop you from letting the best of you slip away. In these words, I see a bridge between Springsteen and my own Asian upbringing. Just this way. And that is why the music and values of Springsteen's American dream can reach and touch a boy from... I'm sorry. I don't know if I can read this. You can. Go on. When I wrote it, I really believed every word, but now... A lot has happened since I wrote those words. Then, I thought Bruce Springsteen was the answer and all I had to do was live by his words. I don't think that's true anymore. Bruce Springsteen got out of New Jersey by following his dream. Bruce sings, "If dreams came true, well, wouldn't that be nice? But this ain't no dream we're living through tonight. If you want it, you take it, and you pay the price." So the question I'm asking is: Can I pay that price? I know having dreams doesn't make me a bad son. I also know that everything I am is because of the sacrifices my mum and dad made. My dad's not a typical dad. We don't have jokey chats. He's not like the dad you see on telly. A lot of the time, he seems pretty angry at the world. I think Bruce Springsteen would understand my dad, cause like his father, they both came from poor backgrounds, both worked hard in factories, both had dreams that never came true, which left them angry. And they both had sons who wanted the chance to make them proud. Bruce has a song called "Blinded by the Light." And when I first heard it, I thought... I thought it was about love and being blinded by the love we might have for a girl or money. But last night, I listened to it again. And Bruce is saying so much more. I was blinded by the light when I first heard Springsteen because I was only thinking, in that moment, about Springsteen and me. But we're not all just individuals. We have friends... and family... and what they think does matter. Success without them isn't really success. Being blinded meant I couldn't see how much I am like my dad and my dad is like me. And as much as I wanted to leave Luton, I understand that it will never leave me. Bruce says no one wins unless everybody wins. My hope is to build a bridge to my ambitions but not a wall between my family and me. That's my dream. My American dream. In Luton. Whoo! Bravo! I'm so sorry. I've missed you like mad. Like a river that don't know where it's flowing, you took a wrong turn and you just kept going. But everybody's got a hungry heart. Everybody's got a hungry heart. You told my family, didn't you? Thank you. Now go and speak to your dad. Beta. - I'm so proud of you. - Thanks. Here, take this. Shaz. You did so good. Well done. I'll get you a drink. - Hello. - Hello. Hi. You must be Javed's father. You should be so proud of Javed. Thanks, Miss Clay, for everything. Oh. Well, you did the work. You're the writer. Son... This Bruce Springsteen, are you sure he's American? Yes. And not Jewish. I read his songs. He said work hard, don't give up, respect your parents. This man must be Pakistani. Son... write your stories, yes. But don't forget ours. Hmm? Come. - All packed? - Yeah. - I've made some food for you. - Mum... I meant to give you this. It's amazing what a good price I got for my Bruce collection. I can easily replace that. Beta. J! J! Mate. Hot off the press. New demo. Listen, thanks for the lyrics. Plenty more where they came from. Right, I'm off for a sound check. I'll try and wing you some free tickets when we go on tour, yeah? - See you later. - See you later, mate. Oi! This is it. Me in Manchester. Me in Leicester. - We're gonna get to that place. - Where we really wanna go. We'll walk in the sun. Bruce! I'm gonna miss you. Come on, Dad. Let's go. - Drive carefully. - Jaroor.
