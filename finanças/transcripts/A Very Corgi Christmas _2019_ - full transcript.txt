(gentle music) ("It's Really Christmas Now" by Gwen Hughes) ¶ Season lights ¶ ¶ Season brights ¶ ¶ By the fire ¶ ¶ You hold me tight ¶ ¶ And I know ¶ ¶ It's really Christmas now ¶ ¶ I waited ¶ ¶ So very long ¶ ¶ By the fire ¶ ¶ A solo song ¶ ¶ It was never ¶ ¶ Really Christmas now ¶ ¶ Like a child looking at the tree ¶ (tablet chiming) (laughs) Whoa! Hey Mom, did you know that dogs can hear noises that are four times further away than humans can? No, I didn't. Pretty cool, eh? Super cool. Listen, sweetie, I'm so sorry this is taking a little longer than I hoped it would. A few more minutes and we'll be on our way. Was that the poster you went with for the Mango Mist campaign? Yep, their focus group suggested that cowboys and dinosaurs are hot this Christmas. Together? I know! Who knew? Lauren, you in here? - [Lauren] Hey! I come bearing gifts! North Soul Records' new band profile. They're waiting on a press release. Thank you. Marco's Sporting Goods Limited, they need a pitch campaign by Monday noon. Got it. And Mango Mist is rethinking the dinosaur cowboy mashup. What? That was their focus group! They want five more options before committing. Okay, I will see what I can do. Oh, did Telstrom Media book their big annual fundraiser? Yeah, the Sunset Halo Center. No, no, no, no, I told them to book with Nightingale. We always have problems with Sunset Halo. Nelson insisted. And it's not your account so don't sweat it. Nelson will have to deal with any issues, if they come up. We should have gone with Nightingale. You know, when they told me you were a workaholic, I didn't believe them at first. (office phones ringing) And now? They say seeing is believing. Look, just because it's Christmas, I don't see why we can't use the free time to catch up on a little work. Now that is the kind of Christmas spirit I like to hear. And you remind me of a young me when I first started. Wow, Doris, that means so much coming from you. (laughs) Have a nice Christmas, ladies. - [Both] Merry Christmas, Doris! (gentle music) Okay, a few more years of hard work and I'll be just like her. VP of the company, vacations in Maui, beach house. And time with Jacob. I'm just wondering if you'll be able to fit any Christmas into your Christmas break this year. It would take a miracle. (laughs) Yeah. (laughs) - [Jacob] Phone charger? Check! Work files? Check! Work notebook? Check. Puppy for Jacob? Ch-- Wait, what? Mom, you promised we could get a dog this year! I know, sweetie, eventually, when the time is right. (phone chiming) What? What is this? The dog breeds that I would like you to consider! Golden lab, black lab, corgi, cockapoo. I emailed you the list. Okay, honey, this looks like every dog breed known to man. (laughs) It is. Did you know that there's over 200 recognized dog breeds in North America in shelters, all waiting to be adopted? I'd be happy with any one of them. Sweetie, a dog requires so much work. A puppy can keep me company while you're working. Listen, sweetie, I know things haven't been the most fun lately and I've been working really long hours, but it's not gonna be this way forever. Now, we are gonna have the best Christmas ever starting right now, okay? Okay. - [Lauren] Sound good? Sounds great! Good. Now, it's a long ride to Grandma and Grandpa's so let's get going. Cockapoo? Did you make that one up? Come on. (laughs) (office phones ringing) Lauren! Mr. David! You remember my son, Jacob? Yes! Why, he's here so often, I feel like he should be on the payroll. At the very least, we should look into getting him a pass. That doesn't sound like a bad idea! (Lauren laughing) Looks like you're taking a lot of work home with you for the holidays! Yeah, well, you know, just trying to start the new year off right, sir. Well, it's good to see such a great work ethic. You know, we have a big promotion coming up in the new year. Really, I hadn't heard about that. Big promotion! And your name is at the top of a very short list. I've entered a new route to take. It should save us almost 30 minutes. Honey, I think I know how to get to Grandma and Grandpa's house. Are you sure? It said that there's traffic on the interstate. Trust me, kiddo, come on. Oh. (car horns honking) You know, I'm not that kind of kid who says I told you so. Christmas cookies? Where'd you get those? School. They were giving out Christmas cookies at school? Well, not exactly. What do you mean not exactly? It's nothing. Spill the beans, kid. And hand me one of those cookies. Kids made them and brought them to school. Which kids? All of them, it was a class thing. Jacob, are you telling me that all the kids in your class made Christmas cookies and brought them to school and you didn't? Maybe. Honey, why didn't you tell me? We could have made Christmas cookies. I know, I just... You just what? I know how hard you've been working and I didn't want to bother you. Ah. Hey, kiddo? You're never a bother, got it? Got it. All right. Want another cookie? Sure, thanks. (gentle festive music) (car horns honking) (engine rumbling) Hmm. Mom, are you sure we're at the right house? (laughs) Of course, honey, I grew up here. Well, where are all the Christmas decorations? Grandma and Grandpa usually have this place decked out. That is strange. Maybe they wanted to wait until we got here so that we could put them up together. Sounds like fun. Yeah. That's weird, it's locked. (doorbell ringing) (knocking) Mom? Dad? It's us. (doorbell ringing) Lauren and Jacob Bradley! They know who we are. Then why aren't they opening the door? I know. Yes. Does this qualify as breaking and entering? No. Are you sure? Well, maybe. (gasping) Mom? Dad? There's no Christmas tree! Where's the Christmas tree? Hold on a second. Hey, sis. I'm good. He's good too. Hey, where are Mom and Dad? And why aren't the Christmas decorations up? No, Jacob and I are here right now. (mischievous music) In Mom and Dad's house. We used the hide a key. Good news, it's not breaking and entering. We're not going to jail. Lizzy, Lizzy, that's crazy, what do you mean you hadn't heard from me? Jacob! Grandpa, it's Jacob, come say hi! Hey, Mom, I found Grandma and Grandpa. Where are they? Florida! Florida? (gentle festive music) But, sweetie, when your father and I hadn't heard back from you, we just figured you were staying home for the holidays. We called and emailed to let you know our plans. That's crazy, are you sure that I didn't call or email back? Lauren, we know how hard you've been working. Ever since Paul. Dad. What your father's saying is that we just thought you were working through Christmas again. I don't always work through Christmas. Do I? We understand, kiddo. Okay, well, what do we do now? 'Cause we're here and you're not. Stay at our place and spend Christmas with your sister! I'm sure she'd love to see you and Jacob. I'm surprised she's not already there. Hello, it's the police. (mischievous music) We got a report of a break and enter. It's not breaking and entering! We're family and-- Hey, Aunt Lizzy! Hey, buddy! How's it going? Good. Mom, Dad, Lizzy is here so we should probably go. Call you in a bit? Okay, sweetie. Merry Christmas! Yeah. Merry Christmas. So, who messed up, you or Mom? Who do you think? (laughing) Hey! Mom and Dad say I didn't call to tell them I was coming this year. Well, that's 'cause you didn't. I didn't call you either? No. Email? (laughing) Really? I'm sorry, it's good to see you. - [Lizzy] You too. So what do we do now? Grandma and Grandpa suggested we just stay here for Christmas. Well, I would get to hang out with my nephew and you'd get to hang out with your adorable kid sister. What do you think, bud? Can I ride in your cop car and turn the sirens on? Or is that against the standard operating procedure? It is against standard operating procedure. Aw shucks. But I'll see if I can't make an exception. Really? Cool! Okay, well, until then. Can we decorate the house? Yes, that is a great idea! Lizzy, I have a ton of work to do. I know, Christmas decorating isn't your favorite thing. But maybe, with a little music (festive music) and a little holiday cheer! I am fresh out. Oh, come on! My shift is finished, my sister and my favorite nephew are in town. I'm your only nephew! And smart as a whip too. Let's get the holidays started! Put some hot chocolate on the stove and let's start decorating this place! Anybody got a problem with that? Hey, hi, over here. Yes, Lauren? Me, hi. Why don't you guys start decorating? I just need like an hour to organize my work and then I will join in on the fun as soon as I can! Sound good? Roger that. Jacob and I are on Christmas duty. ¶ It's Christmas, time to hang up all the stockings ¶ ¶ Getting cozy by the evergreen ¶ ¶ It's Christmas, where's the cocoa for the evening ¶ ¶ Take my mittens colored red and green ¶ ¶ I believe, I believe it's Christmas Eve ¶ ¶ I believe ¶ ¶ I believe, I believe it's Christmas Eve ¶ ¶ Got the lights set up right outside of the house now ¶ ¶ Every year I can see more ¶ ¶ I get older and I learn what Christmas is about ¶ ¶ It's the same old joy, I'm sure ¶ ¶ It's Christmas, time to hang up all the stockings ¶ ¶ Getting cozy by the evergreen ¶ ¶ It's Christmas, where's the cocoa for the evening ¶ ¶ My old mittens colored red and green ¶ ¶ I believe, I believe it's Christmas Eve ¶ ¶ I believe ¶ ¶ I believe, I believe it's Christmas Eve ¶ ¶ Christmas Eve ¶ Mom! Hi! Wow, great job, everybody. Thanks, it was fun. Did you come to see us turn the lights on? I sure did. You can do the honors. Me? No, honey, you should do them. I didn't even help with any of the decorations. Yeah, but decorating for Christmas isn't work, it's having fun, and I want you to have some fun too. Here you go. Thank you, really. All right, you guys ready? (drums rolling) Here we go! Oh no. What's wrong? I'm not really sure. I made sure I plugged it in. Huh. (bells ringing) (mischievous music) Oh my goodness! Mom, look, it's a puppy! Hi, little puppy! Ella! You shouldn't be running off like that. Is this your dog? Actually, it's my neighbors' dog. They let me practice walking her for when I get my own dog. I'm Charlie. Hi, I'm Jacob. My Mom promised me a dog this year too! Really? And my Dad promised me I'd get one for Christmas. Well, he didn't promise me, he said it was a possibility. Sorry, she got away on us. I'm Ben, this is my daughter, Charlie. Hey, I'm Lauren, Lizzy, and this is my son, Jacob. Hi, nice to meet you guys. But, you don't live here. Oh, well, I used to, it's actually my parents' house. Jacob and I are just visiting. Oh, the Bradleys. I thought they were in Florida this holiday season. Oh, they are, there was a-- Miscommunication. Well, the house looks great decorated. Thanks. We can't seem to get the lights to work though. - [Ben] Really? Yeah, I think maybe one of the string lights is out. You know, it's probably just the fuse box. I could take a look, if you don't mind. My dad builds homes. Well, not really, I do renos. Well, we fixes things all the time. Okay, sure, yeah, the fuse box is in the garage. Great. (gentle music) So, Charlie, where's your mom? It's just me and my dad. Really? Huh. Pretty dark in here, do you think you can see okay? Oh yeah, yeah, I'll be fine. I think the fuse box is over there. Oh, right here? Uh-huh. Whoa! (mischievous music) Something's got me! What is it, what? I don't know! What? (laughing) Just kidding. Wow, you are very mean. I'm also pretty funny. I got you, I got you. Ha ha. Ha ha. So funny. Is this Polar Pete? Wait, you know Polar Pete? Oh, I know Polar Pete. I used to watch him all the time when I was a kid. So did I! I literally drove my parents up the wall watching every episode over and over. ¶ Who likes to read day or night ¶ ¶ Has a coat of fur polar white ¶ ¶ Who has muscles full of might ¶ ¶ It's Polar Pete ¶ (laughing) Uh, the fuse though-- Yeah, the-- Is probably-- I-- Just need to be-- The lights, that's why we're here. That should fix it. Yeah. - [Both] We should probably check on the kids, yeah. (laughing) Okay. All right. Okay, well, that should do it, let's give it a try. (festive music) Whoa! It worked! Thank you. It's my pleasure. Our place is better. Charlie! (laughing) My dad kinda gets Christmas crazy. I kinda do, yeah. Hey, Mom, can we go check out their place sometime? Yeah, sure, of course, Jacob, you, your husband, you guys are welcome any time. It's just Jacob and his mom. Oh. Well, the offer still stands. Great. Okay, Charlie, we should get going. It was really nice meeting you. Yeah, it was nice meeting you as well. Thank you, again, for the lights. No problem. Like I said, my dad fixes things. (laughing) Come on, let's go. Hey. I owe you one. Bye. You stop it. (bells chiming) (upbeat music) (knocking) Do you want me to get that? No, no, you eat your cereal. Hey, look, I'm sorry to-- (clearing throat) Ben! Hi. Hi. Sorry to bother you so early in the morning. Oh, no, that's fine, what's up? I need to ask your help with something. With what? You gotta kinda see for yourself. Okay. (mischievous music) What is this? It's a puppy. It's a corgi puppy, actually. No, no, I know what it is. Why is it here? It's a bit of a long story. Charlie, she really wants a puppy for Christmas. - [Lauren] Okay. And I was supposed to pick him up next week but there was this mix up and I had to pick him up this morning. Okay. I mean, he's so cute though, isn't he? Yes, he's adorable! Why is he here? I don't want Charlie to see the puppy until Christmas morning. It's just really important to me that it's a surprise. I'm sorry, what are you asking me to do exactly? Is there any way, any chance that you could hide him here for a day or two, maybe three? Are you serious? It wouldn't be the whole time. The guy that I would usually ask, he's away because it's the holidays. And Charlie's having a sleepover tonight and there's no way I'm gonna be able to hide the dog with a house full of eight year old girls running around. Ben, I wanna help you so badly, but what if Jacob sees him? So? I thought he wanted a puppy too. He does, but we can't. I mean, I can't make a puppy fit right now. It's a huge responsibility and I can barely take care of myself. Okay, I didn't realize. And, you know, I brought a ton of work home for me to do over the holidays and I was hoping my parents could help watch Jacob while I get some of it done but they're in-- Florida, yeah, I know. Yeah. So, it's just, it's just not the right time. It's okay. It's all right. We'll think of something else. Wait. I guess, since I'll be locked in my parents' room working most of the time. Yeah? I could tell Jacob the room is off limits. (puppy whining) (mischievous music) And? And, if I could sneak the puppy in, I could probably keep him hidden for a day or two. Really, are you sure? No, no, I'm not sure about any of this at all. But I do owe you for the fuse box yesterday. Yeah, well, now I kinda owe you. No, let's just call it even. Okay. So, does this puppy have a name? No, not yet. But I was thinking Rocky. Or maybe Columbo. Really? You think your eight year old daughter wants her puppy to be named Rocky or Columbo? Yeah, I should probably get Charlie to name the dog. Probably. (laughs) All right, well, we should probably do this before Jacob wonders where I am. Right. Oh, just one more thing. He can be a bit of a handful. I think I can handle it. (puppy yipping) Shh! - [Jacob] Who was that? (mischievous music) Hi. That was Charlie's dad. What did he want? He asked me for a favor. Cool. Cool. So, what's in the box? This box? Yeah, the box you're holding. (laughs) This box. Well, it's actually a surprise for Charlie. It's her Christmas present. Okay. Okay. Shh! (puppy whining) Well, hello there! Hi! Who's a good boy? Oh, you are so cute! Okay, listen, I'll make you a deal. If you stay quiet, no barking, I'll give you a treat, okay? Deal? Okay, I'll be right back! Stay! (puppy barking) Shh, no, no, no, no, I said no barking! We had a deal! Mom, your cereal's getting soggy! Jacob, honey, I'll be down in a second! All right, I'll be right back, okay? Be a good boy. Stay! Shh! (puppy whining) Sorry about that. Oh listen, honey, Mommy's room is off limits, okay? There's Christmas presents in there that you can't see. Okay! Okay. By the way, your cereal got all mushy so I made you some toast. Oh, thank you, sweetie. Listen, honey, I know that this holiday isn't working out exactly as we hoped it would. What do you mean? Well, Grandma and Grandpa aren't here and I have to spend a lot of time working. It's okay, Mom, I know you're super busy. Do you want me to call Aunt Lizzy? See if maybe she could come and watch you? I have plans. (laughs) Plans? Me and Charlie are gonna go build a snowman at the park. You and Charlie? Yeah, me and Charlie exchanged emails, she's pretty cool. Yeah, she does seem pretty cool. And, before you ask, there will be parental supervision. Charlie's dad is gonna come with us. Really? (gentle music) Okay then. And don't worry, I won't tell her about her present. (laughs) Thank you, baby. - [Jacob] Bye. Have fun, okay? Okay. And bundle up. Okay. Don't forget your gloves! Bye! (festive music) What is this? I leave you alone for five seconds and you-- No, no, don't you give me that look. (laughs) You stop being so cute!

Hey, Lauren, it's Ben, how's it going? Good, how are you? Good, good. I just wanted to call and see how Charlie's present's doing. Oh, you mean this little terror you asked me to puppysit? I did say he was a handful. I hope he's not too much trouble. No, I think I've got him under control. Look, I just want to thank you so much for letting Jacob come over and play with Charlie. Oh, he was pretty excited about building that snowman. A snowman? (scoffs) The neighborhood kids are building a whole snow family. I was thinking, because there's five moms on parent duty right now, I was wondering if you want to take a break. Take a break? Yeah, I'm not really a big fan of breaks. Well, I was hoping I could buy you a coffee. Now, coffee, I am a fan of. Maybe we could take the puppy for a walk while the kids are playing. Yeah, sure, why not. All right, great. I'll be over in a few minutes. Great. Do you wanna go for a walk? Get you out of the house? (laughs) So, are you telling me that this little angel made a mess in the bathroom? No, I am telling you that this little monster destroyed the entire bathroom. We're gonna need new tiles. Really? Uh-huh, oh yeah. New tiles, drywall, the whole kit and cockapoodle. That's not a breed. It's a good thing you're handy. Listen, I can't thank you enough for-- What? (laughs) Oh! Here. Don't think for a second that this coffee makes up for it. (traffic roaring) No. Oh, hey, wait, I've got a-- Oh, here, I have some cash. No, don't worry about it, I'll put enough for both of us. Here you go, Merry Christmas, Santa. (gentle festive music) So, have you thought about how you're gonna tell Jacob that he is not getting a puppy this year? Oh. I'll blame Santa. He might be a bit too smart for that. You might have to do better. I don't know, I'm just trying not to think about it too much. Well, he seems like a good kid. He is, honestly, he's the best. I am so busy but he just keeps us both on track. So you lead a pretty busy life, huh? Yeah, you could say that. Ever think of just relaxing a bit? You know, it is Christmas. Like I said, I'm not a big fan of breaks or relaxing. Plus, there's this really big promotion at work that I really want. Oh, so you're a workaholic. I wouldn't say that I'm a workaholic. All right, well, what would you say? Okay, maybe I'm a little bit of a workaholic. But I wasn't always this way. Well, what happened? You know, being a single mom, wanting the best for your kid, doesn't exactly leave much choice in terms of work schedule or payment schedule, for that matter. Yeah, tell me about it! The mortgage, car payments, utility bills, it adds up. And on one income, it's tough. Exactly. I mean, how could a water bill be so high when there's literally one and half people living in the house! You're preaching to the choir, here. If I could just get this promotion, the extra money will really help us and then I could afford to spend more time at home with Jacob. Yeah. Yeah. I just think that time doesn't have to be a luxury. It's the one thing we have that just only goes one way. And when it's gone, well, you can't get it back. I mean, look at us now, we're sitting in a coffee shop, you've got a coffee, relatively nice company. Just sit back a bit, relax, take a few breaths. (deep exhaling) Nope, can't do it. There's so much to do, I can't. Wow, that lasted like all of two seconds. - [Lauren] I'm sorry, I-- Ben Summers? Oh! Mr. Christmas himself! Charlotte, hey! - [Charlotte] It's so nice seeing you! It is so good seeing you! - [Charlotte] Happy Christmas! Merry Christmas! (laughs) Oh, you must be... Lauren, this is Lauren, Charlotte. This is Charlotte. (laughs) How do you and Benny know each other? Oh. Benny and I are friends. Really? And how do you two-- Oh, you know what? I gotta run, so nice seeing you. You too. And nice to meet you too, Laurie. That's a really cute dog. Thank you. And it's Lauren. Well, she seems nice. She doesn't, she doesn't seem nice. (laughs) Thank goodness, I thought it was just me, but it got like 10 degrees colder when she was here. She is an ex-girlfriend. Yeah. I put that much together. Yeah, she was the first one I dated after Charlie's mom. At least you're brave enough to get out there and try. You know what they say, if at first you don't succeed-- Swipe left? (laughs) I was gonna say try, try again but that's great advice. (festive music) Cutie. We had a fun day. (mischievous music) Hi, Mom. Hey, honey! How was building snowmen? It was great! You should have seen Charlie's place. It was amazing, it was completely decorated! It was like a Christmas explosion! Wow, really? Yeah. Do you wanna watch a movie? Mm-hmm, yep, sure, just right after dinner, okay? Really? Yes. Go wash up and I will be right back down. Okay! Okay. (sighing) (laughing) Okay, here you go. Now you be good, okay? I'm gonna go down and watch a movie with Jacob. When I come back, we're gonna have some quality puppy play time, okay? Okay. - [Actor] Gee whiz, Santa, if we don't hurry, Christmas is gonna be ruined! I have to get all across town, what am I gonna do? I'll handle it. (festive music) (tablet chiming) (gentle music) Come on, let's get you to bed. (sighing) Finally, I can get some work done. (puppy panting) What, what are you trying to-- Oh, you probably need to go. (puppy whining) All right. (gentle music) ¶ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ¶ (puppy whining) (yawning) Puppy? Puppy! Oh. (laughs) (puppy snoring) (gentle music) You can't sleep in there! Although it is pretty adorable. Let's see if we can't find you a better bed. Oh. Perfect. (gentle music) (gasps) How did you get up there? Come here, buddy. There you go. There, now isn't that a little better than a suitcase? (laughing) ¶ Who has the muscles full of might ¶ ¶ It's Polar Pete ¶ (doorbell ringing) You stay there, okay? Okay. Lizzy! Wrapping party! Lizzy! I got Jacob a few things last night and I figured that we could catch up while we wrap presents. A few things? I'm his aunt, I'm supposed to spoil him. You really didn't have to do that. I figured, you're getting him a puppy, so the least I could do was get a few toys. Right, about that. Tell the kid, out of the house for one hour. And then let's get wrapping! I guess Mango Mist can wait for an hour or two. (gasping) (festive music) (wrapping paper crunching) Well, I think I did a pretty good job, considering. Considering what exactly? My overall lack of Christmas spirit. Ugh, stop being such a grump! You used to love wrapping presents, remember? I used to love a lot of things. Especially the holidays, remember? Maybe it's time that you and Christmas made up. Maybe. I'm working on it. Really? That's an interesting development. It wouldn't happen to have anything to do with a certain handsome and handy neighbor who lives down the street? What about you, how's work? I love it, helping little old ladies cross the road and catching the occasional bad guy. Are there any good guys in your life? Well, most of the guys I meet at work have criminal records and they're pretty quick to distance themselves from me. Right. But, no, I haven't met my knight in shining armor yet. But I'm still hopeful. I want what Mom and Dad have. You'll find it, Lizzy. Okay, maybe not in the back of your squad car (laughs) but you will find it. Do you think that that kind of love is still out there? The kind that Mom and Dad have? Maybe. Maybe? Wait a minute, do I detect a hint of positivity there? What? No, I, what do you, why? Well, let's see, what's changed recently? Nothing! This has nothing to do with the aforementioned cute neighbor? Would you like to know what this cute neighbor did? Yes, what? No, nevermind, I'm not telling you, you're a blabbermouth. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, you don't. (laughing) Spill it. (gasping) (festive music) It's adorable! I can't believe he bought you a puppy but Jacob's gonna love it. No, no, no, no, this is not our dog. I'm just hiding him for Ben until Christmas. Oh! He didn't wanna risk his daughter finding the puppy before Christmas. It's like super important to him for some reason. But Jacob can not know anything about this. If he finds out, he is gonna be so disappointed that it's not for him. Wow, that's a pretty big favor for a guy you have no interest in. I owed him one. Uh-huh. Who's the cutest puppy in the world, is it you? Okay, that is Polar Pete, not a chew toy, thank you. All right then. Here it is! Come on. Mom, I'm home! Jacob's home. Quick, let's go before he comes up. But... I'm trying but I can't. It's like he's got a cuteness tractor beam and it just keeps pulling me in. Let's go! Oh, bye, puppy! (Lizzy and puppy whimpering) (mischievous music) Hey, honey. Hey. Okay, I'm off to work, I'll see you later. Good luck with the thing. Right, the thing. Bye, kids. [Jacob And Charlie] Bye! So, what are you two up to? Snack time. Oh! We're gonna go look for cookies. That sounds like a-- (puppy barking) (exaggerated coughing) Cough, cough, cough. Sounds like you're catching a cough. It's nothing. I'll make you some tea with honey. (thudding) What was that? Oh, I have a broken lamp in the bedroom and it keeps falling over, so you know what? I am gonna go take a look at it. My dad can probably fix it. Your dad's the cause. What? Hmm? Nothing. Do you need help? Nope, all good. You guys go eat. Let's go look for the cookies. What did you do? Oh no! (laughs) Polar Pete! Not so mighty after all. I know, honey, you can't be cooped up in here all day. It's no fun for anyone. I have an idea. What? My sister needed help. And that little guy back there needed some excitement. (puppy panting) Besides, how can you say no to that face? I'm more of a cat person. (sighing) (gentle music) (phone ringing) Hello? Hey, Lauren, it's Ben. Hey, Ben, how are you? Good, good. I was just calling to see how our furry friend was doing. Well, there's been a casualty. Polar Pete didn't make it. Guess he's not so mighty after all. Yeah, I had my sister take him out for the day to get some excitement. Well, seeing how you're free, I was wondering if you and Jacob wanted to join Charlie and I at the market. I don't know, I was actually just starting to get some work done. Are you sure? They got hot chocolate here. And Santa actually just made an appearance. Hey, Jacob? Yeah? You wanna go see Santa? Yes! How can I refuse Santa? Yes! (laughs) Okay, maybe just for an hour. Great, oh, and bring Polar Pete with you. Okay. Okay, here you go. - [Charlie] Thank you, Dad. You're welcome, isn't this great? Small town Christmas, the stores are all decorated, people are being friendly with each other, they even serve popcorn! Uh-huh. Oh, let's see Polar Pete. Oh yeah. Yes, this guy has definitely seen better days. You know, this stuffed toy is the reason I got into marketing? That silly Polar Pete song gets stuck in your head and you never forget it. (laughing) And that is a lasting impression. Why don't I hold onto him for a little bit? Just to see what I can do. Okay. Good luck. Shall we sit? Yeah. You know, this place hasn't really changed much from when I was a kid. Yeah, well, maybe the price of popcorn. (Lauren chuckles) There it is. What? A smile. Or better yet, a laugh. Oh, that wasn't a laugh. Oh, say it was a chuckle. (chuckles) Okay, fine, a chuckle, I'll give you that. You gotta tell me, how does a person who grew up here end up hating Christmas? Okay, I don't hate Christmas. What do you wanna say, be mildly offended by it? Maybe off put is the right word? Off put's not really a word, so look, you can laugh all you want, Mrs. Grinch, but I'm gonna get to the bottom of your lack of Christmas cheer. It's a long story. Come on, it's the best time of the year. I mean, have you seen the snow family our kids made? It is really nice to see Jacob having so much fun. But, I mean, Christmas is really for kids though, isn't it? I beg to differ. (laughs) Nice. Yeah, it really brings out the goofiness in your face. As intended. There's that smile again. So, I mean, you must have enjoyed Christmas as a kid. Are you kidding me? I loved Christmas! Oh yeah, I was way worse than you. Way worse, I couldn't wait for the holidays. So then what, why the change of heart? Jacob's father passed away this time of year. Oh. Lauren, I'm sorry, I didn't know. It was a long time ago but it still echoes. That Christmas was the hardest Christmas ever. Jacob was really young so, luckily, he doesn't really remember, but... Then I was a single mother and I had to go back to work full time. So, Christmas took a backseat to work that year and then the next year and the year after that and the year after that. What was his name? Paul. Do you think Paul would have wanted that? What? You to not enjoy Christmas ever again? No, no, of course not. It's just this year with the promotion. I don't know, maybe next year will work out, you know? I wouldn't count this year out just yet. You ready? Ready for what? Okay, everybody say cheese! - [All] Cheese! (camera clicking) - [Grandma] Did you have fun? So much! Did you get the picture with Santa I emailed you? We sure did and I see you have a new friend. Yeah, Charlie, she's pretty cool. That's great. And she's smart too. Did you know that roasted chestnuts are the only nuts that contains vitamin C? I did not! Did you know that it takes 540 peanuts to make a jar of peanut butter? Really? And that's where he gets it from. Okay, guys, it's time to tuck this little munchkin into bed. Oh, not so fast, I see you made a new friend too, dear. Who, Ben? Yeah, he's pretty cool. And are you and your new friends gonna go to the big tree lighting ceremony on Christmas Eve? Well, I-- There's a tree lighting ceremony? Can we go, please, please, please, Mom? Okay, sure, sounds fun. All right, go up to bed, I'll be up to tuck you in in a minute. Thanks, Mom, this is gonna be awesome. Goodnight, Grandma, goodnight, Grandpa. I wish you guys were here. Goodnight, Jacob. Goodnight, Jacob. Goodnight. Goodnight, I'll be up in a minute. So, Ben? I like him. He's good with a hammer. He fixed our screen door last summer. Anything we should know? Nope, love you guys, goodnight. Hey! Thank you so much! How was he? Well, our little pal is now an honorary deputy on the force. And my partner, Ed, has gotten a little attached. I see that. Look at him, fits in my hat! (laughs) Aw! That's so cute! I need a picture! (puppy whimpering) (phone clicking) Perfect. Seriously, thank you. No problem. Oh, and if it's okay, I'll swing by and take Jacob out for a few hours before my shift starts tomorrow. I think I might have an idea that could help with the whole Jacob puppy Christmas dilemma. Really? Mm-hmm. Yes, of course, that would be amazing, thank you. Maybe I can even wrap up all my work in the morning and then we could spend the rest of the holidays together. Yeah! Aw! Hey, buddy, look what I got for you! (laughing) Bye. Did you have fun? Bye, I'll miss you! (laughs) This is great. What? (gentle music) Get in the car. (phone ringing) Hello? Good morning. Hi, Ben. So did the little fur monster destroy anything last night? (laughs) I think he was pretty tuckered out from chasing bad guys yesterday. He slept like a baby. Well, I was thinking, because your sister so graciously took the kids out on an adventure. It might be a good time to bring the little fur monster over. Oh, sure, yeah, actually it's perfect timing. I am just finishing up this last press release and then I will be officially free for the holidays. I could be there in 20 minutes. What's your address? Oh, you don't need it. (laughs) (festive music) Just look for the Christmas explosion. (police siren wailing) That was so much fun! Do you guys get to ride with the sirens on all the time? Just when it's absolutely necessary. Or when my favorite nephew's in town. (laughs) Your family is so cool! Yeah, thanks. So where are we? Well, I know that you wanted a dog for a while now and I thought that maybe, until you guys are ready to adopt one, you could volunteer some time to help dogs who haven't found their forever homes yet. What do you guys think about that? - [Both] Sounds great! (laughing) Awesome. (festive music) (Lauren laughing) Christmas explosion, huh? Well, what did I tell ya? Wow. (laughs) What do you think, super cool or super nerdy? Well, let's just say you definitely know how to maximize the space. Well, come on, it's even better inside. There's more? Oh, yeah. (dog whining) - [Charlie] Aw! Oh my goodness, so much puppy love! All these dogs need a home? Yep, and we can help them by taking them for walks and giving them tons of love and attention until they find the right family to adopt them. So, instead of you having your own puppy, you can be friends with and make a difference in the lives of all of these dogs. Aunt Lizzy? Yeah, buddy? This is the best Christmas gift. I'm gonna make sure all these dogs get the love they need. Now who's ready to go for a walk? Let's go! (upbeat music) Come on, friends. Slower. Slower. I can tell you are impressed with my interior decorating skills. Yes, impressed is the word that I was looking for. Not overwhelmed in the least. I think it takes a sophisticated kind of mind to understand my particular genius. Yes, I am literally drowning in Christmas cheer. (laughing) All kidding aside, though, I think it's really sweet how much you do for your daughter. I want to give her the world. Or, at least, what little part of it I can. Thank you so much for looking after her puppy. I kind of got used to having him around. She's gonna love him. I need your help. What now? Cupcakes. I don't bake. I already baked them. I just need help decorating them. What are we decorating them with? Christmas cheer. They sell that? They do, yeah, come on! (laughing) Let me give you that, thank you. Okay, buddy, okay. There you go. (Lauren laughing) He's a hungry guy. Okay. Okay, so, we've got icing, sprinkles and some gumdrops. Chocolate chips? Of course. Okay.

(laughs) Well, at least he's honest. Yeah. (laughs) So, Charlotte, ice queen from the coffee shop. What happened there? She couldn't sustain the onslaught of Christmas spirit? No, nothing like that. I just think that I wasn't ready. You know, it was all my friends and family telling me to get out there and meet people. Gotta get back on the horse again. There's someone for everyone. Plenty of fish in the sea, yeah. I got that from people a lot too. They mean well. So, what was it like? You know, getting back on the horse again? Oh, terrifying, all your insecurities are just hitting you like a ton of bricks. Please, a guy like you with mad decorating skills? You know, that checks off a lot of boxes. Thank you, I'm gonna take that as a compliment. You should. Seriously, though, you still went out there. Despite the self-doubt. Yeah. I figured, might as well give it a shot. And it was nice, at first. Do you want a coffee? Yeah, sure. Wait, I'm sorry, Charlotte, the woman who pretended to not know my name, was nice? Yes, she was, at first. Then? Then I found out Charlotte didn't wanna have kids. I've got Charlie, so... Ouch. You know, it's all right, we just wanted different things. I mean, it's not the same when we were kids. You know, it's funny, Lizzy and I actually were talking the other day about how we're hoping to find the kind of love that our parents have. Let me guess, still married after many many years? And still madly in love. Ugh, my parents too. I blame them for setting the bar too high. You know what? You're so right. That was a real jerk move on their part. Yeah. So, Lauren Bradley, what is your story? All work, no time for love? No, I mean, my friends have tried setting me up. Trust me, they have, but, I don't know, I guess I'm just worried about what Jacob would think. I think, ultimately, Jacob would just want you to be happy. Okay, this is gonna sound really stupid. But I have been out of the dating game for so long that I'm not even sure if I know how to date anymore. You know, everything is new again and that first kiss, ugh, I dread that first kiss. The only man that I have kissed in the last 15 years is Paul. What if I'm bad at it now? (laughs) No, here I am in this dating pool of people in their thirties, all of whom have probably kissed someone recently, you know, who have more experience than me. It's just scary. Hold on. I have never thought of it that way before. See? And now that you say that, it's all I'm gonna think about now, thanks a lot. We're both doomed. Seriously, though, I think you could really tell if a person is meant for you from that first kiss. You're a romantic. Hopeless. (thudding) What's that noise? It's probably just the kids coming back. Oh, cool. (gasping) - [Both] The dog! (mischievous music) Here, put him in the basement! I don't know where your basement is! The door that goes down the stairs! There's three of them! This one! Hey, Dad. Hey, Charlie! Kiddo, how was your adventure? So much fun, we rode with the sirens on and visited a dog shelter, we took some of the dogs out for walks and we gave them belly rubs and it was just so much love. (door thudding) Oh! Wow! Oh, hi, Mrs. Bradley! Hey, Charlie! Hey! Lizzy brought Jacob home. He had an amazing time too. Oh, that's so great! Well, I should probably get going too. Okay, well, thank you for coming over and helping me decorate the cupcakes. No problem. Were you guys in the basement? Yes. (laughing) Yes, because Lauren wanted to borrow some Christmas decorations for her house. Right, yeah. Well, I know where they are, I can show her. No! No no, no. It's okay, sweetie, 'cause the thing is, is that I wanted more Christmas decorations after seeing your amazing house but then I thought... Then she realized that it's Christmas Eve and she would have to take them down so soon after putting them up so it just didn't make any sense. Yeah, that's exactly what happened. (puppy barking) (exaggerated coughing) Are you guys okay? Yeah. Oh no, no, no, no. It's going around. Stay back, it's contagious. It's not that bad. Well, I hope it's nothing serious 'cause the tree lighting ceremony in the town square's tonight. Yeah, I remember that tree lighting ceremony from when I was a kid. Charlie and I, we go every year. Well, Jacob and I are actually gonna go this year too. We'll be there. Great! We can all go together! Yeah, that sounds great. Sounds like a lot of fun. Yeah, okay, cool! Well, I'm gonna go and I will see you guys later tonight. Great, we'll see you there. Okay. Take care of that cough! Right! (clears throat) - [Lauren] Bye, Charlie! Bye! (coughing) (festive music) Jacob, Lizzy? Mom, there you are! - [Lauren] Hi, how was it? It was amazing! Aunt Lizzy showed me that instead of just adopting one dog, I could make a huge difference in the lives of other dogs in shelters by volunteering and spending my time with them! It was awesome! Oh, honey, that is so great! What a wonderful and important thing to do. I'm so proud of you. Well, I gotta go, my shift starts soon and I left Eddie in the car jamming out to my nineties playlist. A guy from work who likes dogs, tolerates your nineties music and doesn't have a criminal record! (laughs) He was kinda cute with the dogs. See you tomorrow, Christmas dinner! Bye, buddy. Bye! Bye! Okay, well, let's get you cleaned up and ready for the tree lighting tonight. Or did you forget? No, I'm super excited, it's gonna be awesome. Hey, Mom, it's okay that I'm not getting a puppy this year. Spending time with Aunt Lizzy and having fun with you is the best Christmas gift ever! (gentle music) (birds twittering) There's this one dog called Bear. He was so big and fluffy and gave me big kisses on the nose. Aw, that's so great! And another dog, Molly, who just wanted belly rubs the whole time. Honey, I am so glad you had fun. It was so much fun and we made them so happy just by spending time with them. Wait, are you baking? Maybe. I didn't know you can bake! Neither did I! I may have learned a few new tricks today. Huh. That's an interesting development. (laughing) (mischievous music) (phone ringing) Hey, Marcus. Wait, what? Hold on, you're breaking up, I'm in the basement. Yeah, well, no, if we start next summer then it should totally be fine. Yeah, well, so you just call him and then let him know that we'll bring everything over there. How's that batch coming? They all look pretty good, I think. They do look good. Now let's just hope they taste good too. I'm gonna have one shaped like a Christmas tree first, then a heart, then a smiley face. You always have a plan, don't you? Can we bring cookies to everyone at the tree lighting? We sure can! I can just see the headline now. Entire town poisoned by inexperience baker. Gotta have a little faith, Mom. Thanks, honey. (suspenseful music) Dad? Dad? Dad, are you down there? Call me, then we can start first thing. - [Charlie] Oh my gosh! (puppy yipping) Marcus, I'll call you back, all right. (phone ringing) Oh, honey, can you see who that is for me? It's Ben. Oh, hold on. Hey, Ben. Jacob and I are just whipping up some (tablet chiming) Christmas cookies for tonight. What do you mean? Oh my gosh! It's a corgi! Charlie got a corgi for Christmas, can I go see him? Oh no. Oh no, like, I can't go see the dog or oh no, like, things are getting too complicated? (gentle music) (puppy yipping) You had one job, mister. I know, I know, I'm sorry. Two days! I had him for two days! Okay, so the big Christmas surprise was a day early, so what? I mean, look at them. She's smiling, my daughter's happy and it's Christmas Eve. Thank you for making this so special for Charlie. - [Lauren] You're welcome. Oh, I've got something for you. For me? Yeah. What? Ta-da! You fixed him! Yes, the mighty Polar Pete is mighty again. Thank you. Seriously. Thank you. Look, I was just thinking that maybe, after Christmas, if you don't have any-- (phone ringing) Oh, wait. Sorry, I have to take this, give me one second. Mr. David, hi, how are you, is everything okay? Listen, something important's come up. I got a call from Telstrom Media. Their venue, Sunset Halo, promised to have renovations completed in time for the event but that proved to be overly optimistic. They have 500 guests and need to find a new venue immediately. Not just a new venue but a new press release, guest notifications, this is a huge mess! Where's Nelson on this? Nelson's out of the country with his family. Of course. I know it's last minute. Very last minute! But I need you to come in and handle this. But it's Christmas Eve and I'm not even in the city. (laughs) I felt like I could count on my number one. You can, sir, but it's Christmas! And it's not even my account! I just think it's really unfair that I have to take the hit for someone else's bad decision. Sometimes sacrifices have to be made in the present in order to enjoy the rewards of the future. I thought you understood what was at risk. Puppy, you're so cute! What with promotions coming up and-- Yeah, I understand. I'll come in, I'll do it, I'll be in as soon as I can. I knew you wouldn't let me down. Oh, and Merry Christmas. Yeah. Hey, everything okay? I have to go into work. Now? Yeah. Can you watch Jacob for me, please, and take him to the Christmas tree ceremony tonight? Wait, it's Christmas Eve. Yeah, I know it's Christmas Eve but I have to do this. I can't believe your boss is telling you you have to drive into the city and work on Christmas Eve. He's not telling me to but I just don't really have a choice, it's not the same thing. What? If I don't do this, there's a chance I won't get my promotion. Lauren, if you do this, there's a chance you're gonna miss the lighting ceremony. You're gonna miss Christmas. (downbeat music) No, if I leave right now, there's a chance that I can make it back on time. You can't drive to the city and back that quickly. Just, please, take Jacob for me and I'll meet you there. I don't know. It seems like you're gonna cut it crazy close. What would be crazy would be me throwing away all of those nights with Jacob, all the soccer games and the birthday parties and the nights at home eating dinner and watching a movie. Everything would be for nothing. Just, please, take him to the Christmas tree ceremony. If I'm lucky, the traffic will be light, and I'll just miss like a tiny piece of it. Miss out on what? Jacob, honey, something's come up at work and Mommy has to-- Something always comes up at work. It isn't fair, you promised we could go to the tree lighting ceremony together! I know, but Ben's gonna take you. And then I'll try really hard to make it back-- It isn't fair. It's okay that I'm not getting a puppy, it's okay that you have to work all the time, but you promised that we could go to the tree lighting ceremony. And now you're gonna miss out on Christmas again? I thought things were changing but they're not. Things are just the same as always. Jacob. It's okay, I'm used to it. I have to leave right now if there's any chance of me making it back in time for the ceremony. Yeah, no, you go ahead. I'll watch Jacob and we'll be here waiting for you. Thank you. (sighs) Okay. (melancholy music) (energetic music) (traffic roaring) (elevator chiming) Okay. (festive music) (crowd chattering) Hi, Santa! (horse snorting) Okay, s'mores, let's go get a spot. Okay. All right, list of contacts. Contacts-- (distant festive music) ¶ One more year, I hardly can believe ¶ ¶ We made it through ¶ ¶ Feels so far away ¶ ¶ Bright and clear above the midnight sky ¶ ¶ I see a star greet the brand new day ¶ Doris? Lauren. I should have guessed you'd be here. (laughs) Doris, it's Christmas Eve. I know it is, my dear. Why else would I be playing Christmas music? (festive music) (crowd chattering) Mr. Summers? Yeah? Do you think my mom's gonna make it on time? I don't know but she's gonna try her best and that's all that matters, right? I guess. But why are you here on Christmas Eve? Same reason you are, I expect, to get work done. (laughs) You're an executive. A VP, you shouldn't have to be here. Hogwash. The only thing more important than getting a promotion is getting the next promotion, am I right? Is anybody else here? No, I expect they're all home with their families. Their families. Where everybody should be on Christmas Eve. Most people, sure. But not us. Why not us? Because we're different. Oh, everybody else can laugh and call us workaholics but what do they know? They'll never amount to anything. Workaholics. You know, we're the same, me and you. I'm sorry but I thought that, once you get to a certain position, you don't have to work as hard anymore. (laughs) Well, maybe that's true, if I become president. Which, if Mr. David decides to step down in the next few years, I might be next. The next president of the firm? Oh, trust me, Mr. David knows how hard I work. And, if I keep it up for a few more years, I just might make it. Do you always work on Christmas Eve? Well, if you ask my second husband, Larry, he would say yes. But what did he know? He never made it past middle management. Your second husband? And that's why I married Martin. 'Cause he gets it. (laughs) And Martin is your third husband? Fourth time's a charm. Christmas candy? What? I find sugar's the only thing that keeps me going on these all-nighters. No. Oh, suit yourself. No. No. No, no, no, no. Well, more for me. (sighing) No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on. (elevator chiming) (crowd chattering) (phone ringing) Hello? Lauren, I wanted to check in and see how things were going. I think you're gonna have to call Nelson on this, sir. What do you mean? I have worked hard for this company for a really long time but I am not gonna sacrifice any more time with my son. Time only goes one way. I love my job, sir, and I am really good at it. And if you don't feel like I'm right for this promotion, so be it, but I think we both know what I bring to this company. Lauren, this needs to get fixed. Yes, it does. But this is Nelson's mess so he needs to clean it up. I'll see you after the holidays, sir. Merry Christmas. (phone clicking) Merry Christmas. (sighing) (engine rumbling) (traffic roaring) (police siren blaring) Oh no. No, no, no. Come on! Come on, come on, come on, come on. I am so sorry, officer, I know that I was speeding but I-- Lizzy? Lauren. Do you know how fast you were going? Where are you even coming from? It's a long story. I have to get to the tree lighting ceremony. Can you please, please help me? When your big sister asks for a favor on Christmas Eve, you do it. Thank you! Yeah. I love you! We have to hurry though, come on. Come on! Hey, Eddie! Lauren? What's going on? We have to get Lauren to the tree lighting ceremony or she's gonna miss it. That's too bad. It's a whole thing with the puppy, trust me-- The puppy? Why didn't you say so? Hit the siren! It's not a real emergency-- Yes, it is! It's a Christmas emergency, hit the sirens! (mischievous music) (police sirens wailing) (crowd chattering) (clunking) (festive music) (crowd applauding) Whoa! She didn't make it. (puppy whimpering) No, but I'm sure she tried her best. Yeah, can we go home now? (puppy yawning) Sure, yeah, let's go. (police siren wailing) (melancholy music) I'm so sorry, Lauren. They're gone, everybody's gone. ¶ All the couples holding hands ¶ ¶ And I'm feeling out of place this holiday ¶ ¶ All the trees and the lights ¶ ¶ And mistletoe above ¶ I missed it, I missed Christmas Eve. How could I let this happen? (gentle music) (puppy barking) Hey, buddy, what are you doing here? Hi! I knew you'd be back. Jacob? You were just a little late. I know, sweetie, and I am so sorry. I never should have went in. I never should have even considered working on Christmas Eve. I spent so much time thinking about this promotion and the future that I completely lost track of-- The present? Yeah. And that's what Christmas is all about, the present and the presence of me. And I have been absent for so long and I just... I can't make the same choices anymore. (puppy whimpering) I'm so sorry I'm late, sweetie, but I'm here now. I love you, Mom. I love you too, sweetie. I'm so sorry that I missed the tree lighting. You didn't miss anything. Fuse box! (clunking) Wow! I'll take him. - [Ben] I told ya. It's beautiful. You see? Christmas magic. You did this? It was Jacob's idea, but I did help. I'm sorry that you had to meet this workaholic version of me. Are you a workaholic, really? (laughing) I didn't notice. I made you laugh. It was a little bit of a chuckle. Ben, I... I never thought that I could feel this way about someone again. Come to think of it, I never thought I could feel this way about Christmas again. But I do. You helped me find the Christmas magic-- (romantic music) I told you my dad fixes things. Best Christmas Eve ever! (puppy whining) Jacob, I'm really sorry you didn't get a puppy this year. But, if you want, you can come visit mine any time. Deal! (gasping) Are you... Are you crying? What, me? No, no, no. I just never would have taken you for the sensitive type, is all. Well, maybe we could keep this little secret to ourselves, okay? Sure, okay. I just like happy endings. Me too. (laughing) So? So? How was it? How was what? (laughs) Our kiss! Oh! I mean, I thought it was pretty okay. Really? Yeah. Well, why don't we ask the expert? What did you think? (puppy whimpering) Really? (puppy yipping) I guess we're just gonna have to try again.
