Whoa, fella. Hold on. You lost? Now, who would go and do such a cruel thing to a beautiful horse like you? Animal Control. Hello! This is Animal Control. Sorry. Must have butt-dialed you. Annabelle, did you hear me? Mr. Cash and I are deeply sorry about your Grandpa Joe's passing, but... you won't be able to stay here. The property will be going to foreclosure in one week and... I remember my mom told me there were seven colors in the rainbow. There is. You just have to remember Roy G. Biv. It's an acronym to remember the order of the colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. My mom told me that. I have to take you to the orphanage for now. Just until we find a next of kin, or perhaps your father. Yeah, I think my dad died in some kind of war. Well, I'll confirm that for you. Regardless, I will find you a good home as quickly as possible. What about the animals? Okay, who's gonna take care of them? I'm sure a good home will be found for them as well. But they're my family, okay? They're all I have left. I'll take care of 'em. Since I'll be buying this property out of foreclosure anyway. In fact... you got that paperwork? No, Mr. Gilmer, they're not ready. Besides, there's still a week left. I can take care of the farm, okay? And the animals. I've lived here all my life. I know I can do it! Yeah? And I can chase rainbows, little girlie! Little girl, why don't you, uh, go on through the house and grab up all the possessions you feel a connection to and take 'em with ya. Goodwill will be here in a couple of days to start picking things up. Oh, I'll take extra special care of this one. His name's Baby, okay? And he's not used to other people yet. - Uh, uh-huh. - And those other animals, - those are my family too, so you better... - Family? Family is overrated and unreliable, kid! They will always let you down! We need to go, Annabelle. Okay. Holy wow. What are you looking at? There's a unicorn. No, no, I mean, it was just there. I swear. Well, hopefully, it's just temporary. Annabelle, why don't you wait for me over there? I may have a lead on her father. I'm not sure yet, but I didn't want to tell her in case I got her hopes up. A lead on an absent father. I'm not sure how they do things in England, but... - I'm Australian. - Whatever. He's probably absent for a reason. Well, I need to find out why. Don't think that just because there's a related gene involved that it's the best situation for a child. I grew up in this orphanage, and look at me now. Uh, you never left? You were never adopted? Well, no. But now I run this place. Hi. Oh, hi. - I'm Emma. - Annabelle. Weren't you the one I saw looking at me from the window? Uh-huh. I knew you were coming. What do you mean? I saw a rainbow this morning. And felt this warmth all up and down my body, and then my knuckles kinda vibrated. What is that? Some sort of tooth? It's a unicorn horn. That's funny. I thought I saw one this morning. You probably did. They're real. Really? Are you talking about unicorns again, Emma? Yes, Annabelle saw one. I said I thought I saw one. Well, don't listen to her. She rarely talks, and when she does it's only about unicorns. Are you going to some costume party or something? - Huh? - Your... No. I'm a magician. Annabelle! I'm leaving. It looks like you've made friends already. What are you two still doing down here? Get up...! You too! Please don't leave me here. Be back before you know it. I promise. Pinky swear. - It's gonna be all right. - Come back. My mom gave it to me when Jake and I were little. Before she died. It's cool. My mom's gone too. It was a long time ago, but I've been living with my grandpa and my... And who? My animals. They're my family. What kind of animals? Cows, sheep, goats, chickens, dogs, cats. We have a new baby pig. So cute. Aww. I wanna see all of them. Who's feeding them now? Wanna see this coin disappear? Normal hand, nothing going on. Nothing up my sleeves. Dang it. Really, Jake? Sorry. I won't stay here. My animals need me, okay. I need to go. You won't be able to leave. They lock all the doors from the outside. Yeah. But there's a service door in the kitchen that has a loose latch and bolt. So you can easily get out with just a playing card. Jake, may I please borrow one of your playing cards? That's goofy, right? Holy wow! Hello? Is anyone here? Who's making that sound? Is it you? Frieda? Stewie? Mr. Bacon? Oh. Hey, you're the one I saw this morning. Are you lost? Are you from mean ol' man Gilmer's farm? Whoever did this did an awesome job. I mean, you look like a real unicorn. Holy wow! You are real! Do you have a name? I... I'm sure you have a name. I can't translate that. Yeah. Um, so I'll just call you "Charlie." That's a good boy unicorn name. Charl... No. Um, okay, how about... Sparkle. Sparkle it is! So, Sparkle, where are you from? I mean, what are you doing here? Tell me your story. I'm pretty tired. I think I'm gonna rest. You'll watch over me though, right? Annabelle? Annabelle, I'm waiting for you. Oh, and watch out for that water. Are you lost? Sparkle? Sparkle? Sparkle? One of your dumb farm animals? He's not a farm animal, he's a u... There. All arranged. Tomorrow you transfer to the home for wayward children. All because of one mistake? I didn't realize that picking a lock, and running away from this horrible place was that wrong. Is there some sort of manual you didn't show me? You think you're so funny! But no one runs away from my orphanage and goes unpunished. The home for wayward children? I heard that place is really bad. Yeah, like super bad. Hey, wanna see me disappear? These are smoke bombs. Anyway... You wouldn't believe what I found. The unicorn I saw. Yeah, you were right. It is real. I knew it! That explains the rainbow I saw yesterday when I felt you coming. What do you mean? I have this book about unicorns. It says they come from rainbows. And only appear to people, 'cause they're like helper creatures. - Like angels? - Yeah, sort of. But they only visit to fulfill wishes and dreams. And only have a certain amount of time to do it. So what happens if they don't? They start to lose their magic and become regular horses. This is a real unicorn horn. My mom said one appeared to her when she wished for the birth of her children. Since she wasn't supposed to have any. So what does that mean for me? Maybe it's here to help me save my farm and my animals. - Oh, my gosh, you're right! - Yeah! So what are you gonna do? Well, I'm not gonna go to that prison for wayward kids, so I'm going to run away. - Can I come with you? - No, Emma! But I wanna meet a real unicorn. You're not going anywhere. You survived. Of course, Master Chief. I promise, I didn't push her too hard. It's not you I'm worried about. She's tougher than she looks. Are we talking about the plane, sir? Officer Hart, this is Natalie Evans. She's from Child Protective Services. She's got some questions that I need answered. Thank you, Master Chief. - Mr. Hart. - Karl. Do you remember a woman named Laney Brennan? Oh, yeah, of course. We dated all through high school. Even for a little while after. And what happened? We broke up, shortly before I was deployed, and... and I never heard from her again. Why? Well, I'm sorry to inform you, but Laney passed away from cancer about ten years ago. Oh. Do you know about this? Uh, a birth certificate? I don't understand. You didn't know she had a baby? Judging from my calculations, about six months after you were deployed. Uh, no. I had no clue. Uh... Is this for real? I have a daughter? Well, I'm guessing Annabelle's grandfather, Joe, never sought you out. And, uh, well, he just passed away. Sir, I... I'm... I'm not entirely too sure about what I'm supposed to do here. Well, what typically happens with a new father is he's given a handshake and a new cigar. But I don't have any cigars. So... Congratulations, son. I'm a dad. Indeed you are. This goes against my better judgement, not to mention all conceivable Air Force regulations, but I saw something the other day that I can't explain. A miracle perhaps. You know, my gut saved me when I was flying Scorpions over Afghanistan. Now it's telling me to set you free, son. And I always listen to my gut. Now you go, and find that little girl. Be the family that she needs. Now, get outta here! Before I change my mind. Thank you, sir. At the tone, please record your message. Hi, Mother Chloris, it's Natalie Evans from Child Protective Services calling in regards to Annabelle Brennan. I've got some good news. Give me a call back, please. Thanks. I'm really not too sure what just happened. Message erased. Shh. It's me. I'm coming with you. It's not a good idea, Emma, Jake said... I wanna see a real unicorn. And you might need my help. Okay. It's not working. Shh! What are you doing? Going to see the unicorn with Annabelle. You can't, we'll get in so much trouble. Please, Jake, I really need to do this. Fine. But I'm going with you. You'll need a man to protect the both of you. It's not working, okay. I think they fixed it. Hold this. Here you go. Huh. Give me this. - Yes! - Yes! You can't be serious. Come on. Come on, let's go. Come on. Your sister's really sweet. Yeah. You know, she's been happier around you than she has with anyone. Really? Yeah. Can I ask you something? How'd your parents die? Oh, my mom died a long time ago from cancer, so I've been living with my grandpa, and then... I never really met my dad. But I think this was his. Well, not sure. Anyway, my mom said he died fighting for our country. Come on, we better keep going. She thinks that I died fighting for our country? Well, at least her mother gave me a noble death. Why'd you two break up, if you don't mind me asking? I don't really remember. I mean, we were young, we were just out of high school. Probably argued about something dumb like all teen couples do. Whatever it was, it never gave me any reason to believe that she was pregnant. I just wish she would've told me. It's not your fault. Now you have the opportunity to have some of that and be there for Annabelle. The place she's at right now, I wanna get her out as soon as possible. Yes, this is she. Unfortunately, Annabelle is not ready for her transfer yet. But I do need to add two more children to that list. He's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Yeah, it's a pretty good hair and makeup job. What are you doing here, boy? I named him Sparkle. Why would you do that? Sparkle's a good name! Come on, do you wanna meet the rest of my family? Yeah! And this is Baby. You are the worst pet namer in the whole universe. Sorry, I take it back! So what do you think of my family? I love 'em all. And Sparkle is definitely here for you. - How do you know? - I just know. He's got a mission. My book says he won't be able to return home until he completes it. Oh, no, it's Mother Chloris! Okay, um, we have to get inside, come on! - What do we do? - We have to stay quiet. She's wearing my necklace. What are you doing here? Annabelle ran away from the orphanage again. I found her here yesterday. Have you seen her? Ran away. What kind of racket are you running? She had help. She better not mess with my plans to buy this property. I wouldn't put it past that girl to try. She's a clever one. But she's just an orphan. And don't worry, when I find her, she's going to be transferred to a new home. And believe me, she won't be running away from that one. Well, you be sure of it. And if you do, I can see myself making a, uh... generous donation to your orphanage. I'm looking forward to it. What? What do you mean a visitor? I have no appointments today. Miss Natalie from the CPS? Well, you tell her to make an appointment. Fine. Fine. I'll be there shortly. That was close. I can't believe she's wearing my necklace. That's so rude! She'll be back. Well, Emma and I need to get back to the orphanage, - before we get in more trouble. - What about the unicorn? You saw him already, Em. Now we have to help him complete his journey. Jake's right, Emma. It's already too late for me, but you two might get in more trouble. Plus, there's no electricity or water in this house anyway. But I'm the unicorn expert, you need me. Sparkle needs me. I'm staying until his mission is complete. We don't even know what that is. Yet. We don't know yet. Fine. But we can't stay here in case Mother Chloris comes back. Okay, I think I have an idea. This is the perfect place to stay hidden. And look out for Sparkle and the other animals. Perfect place to watch out for rainbows too. And a perfect place to get mosquito bites. You are Annabelle's father? That's what that says. It doesn't mean anything. Anyone could have doctored it. - Seriously? - Seriously. You've seen the scams these days. And why would we try and scam you? I met Mr. Gilmer, and he told me all about the foreclosure on the farmhouse, and the people who want to take it from him. Take it from him? It's not even his to take. Well, it doesn't matter anyway. Annabelle's gone off and ran away. - She's runaway? - For the second time! A second time? What kind of a racket are you running here? Why aren't you out there looking for her? What do you think I was doing before I was rudely interrupted by this impromptu meeting? I found her the last time at her grandfather's farmhouse. But she wasn't there this time. - Have you called the police? - Of course! And they said they have a lead. - Perhaps someone saw her in the city. - All right. You'll call us if you hear anything? Of course, I will. Whoo, it's hot. Hello. This is Mother Chloris from the orphanage. I just had a visit from someone who claims to be Annabelle's - long-lost father. - What? That's absurd! I've never seen a father around that place. I saw the birth certificate with my very own eyes. Wait, so what happens now? Well, with Annabelle missing, there is no child to claim as his own, is there? I got it. I'm approaching Joe's farmhouse right now and I'll see if she... What the... W-what happened? I just saw a horse with a horn. I'll call you back. Whoo. He's gonna get Sparkle. Wait! If you get caught, we'll all be sent back to the orphanage. - Hello. - What happened? What do you mean? - You said you saw a horse with a horn. - What? Why would I say that? Never mind. Did you see Annabelle? No. But I'll keep looking. Toodle-oo! Wow. For a fake unicorn, you sure do have some magic skills. My book talks all about their magic. But I still can't believe what I just saw. I think it's about time I take a look at this book. Okay, so I was reading the section about granting wishes and stuff, and it says the unicorns can only grant those to the receivers. - Who's the receiver? - Annabelle is, dummy! - Sparkle is here for her. - So you say. Prove it. Make a wish. Okay, um... "I ask of you, my magic steed, not what I want, but what I need. And if you feel my heart is true, then grant me the wish I ask of you." I wish for the water and the electricity to be turned back on in the house. So we may shower and get cleaned up. Ha-ha. Nice trick, Annabelle. Don't listen to him, Annabelle. Make another wish. Okay, um... "I ask of you, my magic steed, not what I want, but what I need. And if you feel my heart is true, then grant me the wish I ask of you." I wish for hot pizza and ice cream because we're starving. This is so awesome! Oh, wow! I'm not sure how you did that, but I'll figure it out. - It was all Sparkle! - Whatever. - Wish for something bigger. - Okay, like what? Teleportation to the moon. That's so dumb. Um, I ask of you, my magic steed, not what I want, but what I need. If you feel my heart is true, then grant me this wish I ask of you. We wish to be teleported to the moon. Sparkle, I said I wish to be teleported to the moon. Told you. That wish was too ridiculous. I mean, if we were instantly teleported to the moon, we'd die 'cause we couldn't breathe. Yeah, okay, so Sparkle was just looking out for us. Make another wish. How about... a million dollars? Okay. I ask of you, my magic steed, not what I want, but what I need. And if you feel my heart is true, then grant me the wish I ask of you. I wish for a million dollars. Chloris, you ordered pizza to the farmhouse? Me? No. Maybe it was your horse with the horn. Yeah, yeah, or the kids. - Did you see them? - No. But you might wanna get down here. Fine, wait for me. Hmm. Maybe you only get two wishes and you used them both already. That's not what the book says though. It's supposed to be unlimited as long as the unicorn remains on Earth and still has to fulfill its purpose. And once complete, the receiver is gifted a treasure - at the end of the rainbow. - What kind of treasure? There's supposed to be pots of gold at the end of rainbows. What? I'm just kidding. No, you're right. And that's how I'll buy back my grandpa's farmhouse! That's why he's here. It has to be. Seriously, I was kidding. Come on. You really think you're gonna find an actual pot of gold? We finally found Sparkle's purpose. We need to find a rainbow. Oh, no, it's Mother Chloris again. Both of you go keep lookout over there. - What are you gonna do? - Don't worry, I got this. I ask of you, my magic steed, not what I want, but what I need. And if you feel my heart is true, grant me this wish I ask of you. Please protect us, Sparkle. I've seen you do better than that, Sparkle. What do you think we should do now? We should probably get some flyers printed off. That's a good idea. We can go back to the farmhouse, and I can get a recent picture of Annabelle. Maybe use some of your military training to pick up on any clues as to where she might be hiding. They don't teach us to be detectives. You know what I mean. So what's with the Australian accent? - You noticed. - Well, it's kinda hard not to. Well, I was born and raised in Tasmania. Came over here on a goodwill mission to assist with orphans, and just fell in love with the place. The people, the culture, so I stayed. So you're far from home. Depends on your definition of home. Mm. It sure beats orphanage food. One thing's for sure, I know you're a real good magician now. - Really? - Yeah. You sure know how to make food disappear. Sparkle! We see the rainbow. Sparkle, we gotta get you home. Sparkle, where are you? Sparkle! We're gonna miss it. This place hasn't changed one bit. I remember meeting Laney's father for the first time right there on the porch. How was that? Not sure. I was just staring at the shotgun he was holding the entire time. Huh. Oh, wait, I know, I know. I ask of you, my magic steed, not what I want, but what I need. And if you feel my heart is true, then grant me this wish I ask of you. I wish to be teleported under the rainbow. I don't understand. Isn't this what you need, Sparkle? What happened now? We can't find the end of her pot of gold. Surprise, surprise. This doesn't make any sense. I remember you. Food from downstairs is still warm, and judging by the amount... She's so beautiful. I wish I'd been here for all of this. Now you can make up for it. Just hope it's not too late. It's not. Seen it happen many times over my years of being a social worker. It's why I do it, honestly. Just because a child's been brought up differently, there's still a chance to positively affect their lives. I believe there's a special reason that you were meant to enter Annabelle's life at this moment. Uh... I started to doubt if I would ever have a family of my own. It's honestly beginning to feel like an impossibility. Kinda like chasing rainbows, huh? Yeah. I guess so. Oh, this is an absolute mess. Let's just keep looking around, see what we can find. Uh, definitely more than one person. It's a pretty smart location, eye on the house, hidden from view. Where's the nearest farm from here? That would be Bo Gilmer's. 'Bout a mile away. He's the one who bought, or at least intends to buy the farm once it forecloses. Tomorrow. Tomorrow? Yeah, sorry. Can we go visit him? Of course. - Mr. Gilmer. - What? You remember me from last week, with Annabelle. Oh, gee. That was so long ago, I don't know if my memory goes back... Of course, I remember you. Well, this is Karl Hart, Annabelle's father. It's nice meeting you, Mr. Gilmer. - Have you seen Annabelle? - No. Uh... why would I have seen Annabelle? So, you... you bought Joe Brennan's farm, huh? Tomorrow. But you've got a sold sign in the front yard already. I do? Oh... Must've been that banker. Uh, they are anxious to unload that property. Honestly, just doing them a favor. Are you? Well, then you won't mind just postponing the purchase? I mean, since I'm in Annabelle's life now, I'd like to explore options of her living there. You know, tradition, and family heritage and stuff. Don't wanna lose that, right? Oh, of course not. And now that you've finally decided to be a part of your daughter's life, maybe that ancestral heritage will live on. Finally decided? I didn't even... Thank you for your time, Mr. Gilmer. If you could postpone the purchase, we'd really appreciate it. And if you see Annabelle, please give me a call. I'd really like to reunite the two. Yeah. Bet you would like to reunite them. That woman had been on my watch. Who does he think he is? Don't let him get to you. You said I'd come at a perfect time, but it... Why does it feel like everything is working against me? You just have to have faith. I'm starting to think that I'd have been better off if you hadn't gone to public records and found my name on Annabelle's birth certificate. That's a harsh thing to say. I know, I... I'm sorry, okay. I-I didn't mean it. - I'm just... - I know you didn't. And by the way, I didn't go to the public records. What do you mean? Well, it just magically appeared the day I went to pick Annabelle up. It was just sitting there, randomly. Mean old man Gilmer is gonna buy the house tomorrow. I just... I don't understand, why isn't Sparkle helping me? You should wish for him to stop it. Don't you think I've already tried that? Okay, it didn't work. His horn keeps fading too, I think he's losing his magic. - We need to do something. - What? I don't know. Maybe, somehow, stall the bank from selling the house. I can call them. I could say I'm an interested buyer and will pay double the price. That's a great idea. Yeah, and then we can tell them that they have to wait a week, 'cause your money is in some "hedgehog" funding, or something. Yeah, it'll work! Hello. Y-yes, hello. I'm calling in regards to the property on 8906 Farm Road in Springwell Town. Yes, I'll hold. Yes. Yes. M-my name is, um... Salty O'Pepperson. And I noticed the sold sign in the front yard, but I have a counteroffer. You don't say. You don't say. Well, yes, I sure will. - What did he say? - He says the sign shouldn't even be up in the yard. - And? - And he's on his way over here to remove it and to meet me, so we can go over the details. What do you mean? He'll see you're not real! Or Irish. Ah, dang it! Great. What are we gonna do now? So... Which one of you is the leprechaun? You knew I was faking it? Of course, I did. My pet rock does a better Irish accent than that. But I still needed to check out this sign. It'll still be sold tomorrow, but you never know. I ask of you, my magic steed, not what I want, but what I need. And if you feel my heart is true, then grant me this wish I ask of you. I wish for the farmhouse not to be sold tomorrow. What? Do I still have barbecue sauce on my nose? You will not sell my farmhouse tomorrow! Yes, I will. You will not sell my granddad's farmhouse tomorrow! Yes, I will. You think you're a Jedi wizard or something? Come on, Sparkle, please. Um, interesting-looking horse. I gather you ran away from the orphanage. Well... your secret's safe with me. But after tomorrow... your hiding place is gone. Dumb unicorn. Sparkle! Sparkle, where are you? I'm sorry if I called you dumb, okay? I didn't mean it. - Where could he have gone? - Maybe he finally went home. But he hadn't fulfilled his purpose yet, he can't go. I mean back home to his stable, with his real owners. Where he belongs. Maybe his purpose wasn't for me, or for the both of you, but for somebody else. Sparkle! Sparkle! Where are you? Sparkle! Sparkle, where are you? Come on. Settle down, boy, I ain't gonna hurt ya. There, that has to be him. Okay, I know a way. Come on. What in tarnation! I knew it was fake all along. Get... Good thing Animal Control will be over tomorrow for all the animals at Joe's farm. I'll have 'em scoop you up as well. He's all tied up. Oh, no, he lost his horn. We have to get him out of there. The door is padlocked. Do you have anything up your sleeve? Is that a trick question? What? N-no. Like do you have anything that might pick the lock? Oh! No. Okay, I'm gonna climb through the window and then I'll see if there's another way from inside. - What should we do? - You two stay as lookouts. Hey. Hey, are you okay? Are you hurt? I'm so sorry about your horn. This is all my fault. Maybe if I hadn't made so many stupid wishes, you'd still have some of your magic. I'm so sorry, boy. Annabelle, hurry up! Get out of there! Well, well, well. Looks like my bait worked. What do you mean? You think I want your dumb-looking horse? No, I got horses of my own. You wanted me? Oh, uh, j-just temporarily. Oh, it-it's Bo Gilmer. Guess who I just caught in my mouse trap. Hello, Annabelle! My, my, you've been a hard little girl to find. But it looks like you've reached the end of your rope. Well, what should I do with her? Just hold her for me until the morning. I'll come and drive her straight to the new home myself. What about the other two? I-I haven't seen 'em. We'll find them soon enough. And they'll get there too. Mother Chloris, if I cooperate, will you please leave Emma and Jake alone? Okay, It's all my fault that they ran away in the first place. No. Well, this little girlie won't be going anywhere. And I believe that means you're the proud new owner of another farm. Well, that's right. And don't worry, I'll honor our deal and get you a charitable donation. I look forward to it. Looks like you're gonna be my barn guest for the night. Oh, that's a nice watch you got there, don't ya think? Well, at least you get a final moment with one of your animals. Before they're all gone. Annabelle. Annabelle! Are you okay? I'm fine. What should we do? Just give up. No. You and Jake need to run away and forget about me. I'm so sorry for getting you into this, but Mother Chloris is not gonna go easy on you. Don't say that. The farm is gonna get sold tomorrow, my animals are being given away, and I'm going to a new orphanage. - But, Sparkle... - Sparkle's horn is gone. Okay? There's no more rainbows, and even when there were, they did nothing. Okay? It was a complete fail. Maybe we didn't read the book right, maybe we missed something! Emma, just give up! Okay? There's nothing we can do. And it's all my fault. Why don't we use another horn? - What do you mean? - Your necklace. You're right. Annabelle, did you hear that? - Yeah. - My necklace is a real unicorn horn. Maybe it'll work on Sparkle. Maybe, but there's one problem though, you don't have it, remember? Oh, we'll go steal it back from Mother Chloris. No. No, no, no, no way. You are not getting into more trouble for me. We're already in trouble. What do we have to lose? I said run away. Nope. We're family now. And we're not leaving anyone behind. Come on, Jake. You hear that? She said we're family now. Well, I really do appreciate you helping me out. It's fine. And uh, we'll hang the rest up in the morning. Thank you. You know, despite the circumstances, I really have enjoyed getting to know you. Honestly, I-I don't know how I would've done any of this without you. Oh, you know, it's part of my job. But I really enjoyed spending time with you too. You know, despite the circumstances. Well, uh, I guess, we better get some rest. Yeah. Um, I need to go feed my fish anyway. Oh, all right, well, good night. Good night. Feed my fish, really? I don't even have a fish. What do you think's gonna happen when this is all over? We'll probably be sent to that other orphanage. I'd rather just run farther away. - We can't do that. - Why not? As long as we're together, we'll be okay. Sorry for not talking since Mom and Dad left. That's okay. I know you miss them too. But I sure did miss your voice. Even though it can get whiny sometimes. Thanks for protecting me too. I know you don't believe in any of this unicorn stuff. My job is to protect you. And I promise I will for the rest of my life. And you know what? I do believe. I believe in all of it. I shouldn't have let them go. I mean, they're gonna get caught. And then it was all for nothing. I shouldn't have run away from the orphanage in the first place. I miss my mom so much, Sparkle. I thought maybe she sent you from heaven, but I guess I was wrong. Good boy. - Where do you think she is? - Shh. You're gonna wake everyone up. Okay, you go check upstairs, - I'm gonna check the office. - Okay. Emma. Emma. She's wearing my necklace. - What do we do? - We have to get it back. I have an idea. - Don't kill her. - Huh? No. Okay, okay. You take this. Okay, follow my lead. It's not gonna work. It is. It is. Fine. You did it! Yes! Okay, let's go. No! Annabelle. - Annabelle. Annabelle! - Emma? Emma, what happened. Are you okay? I'm fine. - Jake? - Hello. - We got the horn! - You did? You're back, Sparkle. Hey! Hey! Okay. We gotta go! Go, go, go! Come on, Sparkle. And where do you think you're going? We have a unicorn to get home. If that's a unicorn, then I'm a fire-breathing dragon. Where's my necklace? It was my necklace! Finders keepers. That's right. Finders keepers. Well, who are you kids anyway? They're my family. Underrated and completely reliable. They've never let me down. That's enough! It's time we get you all to your new home. - Don't make another move. - Or what? You kids got some more magic up your sleeve? Actually, I do. Wait, they disappeared! Wait... There they are! - Go get 'em! - What about you?! I got a farm to buy! I hope this works. I'm sure it will. I know that you've got other work to do, kids to take care of. As far as I'm concerned, Annabelle's well-being is still my job. I plan on finishing it through to the end. So have you thought about what's gonna happen once you find Annabelle? You know, with the Air Force? I'll probably be permanently discharged. You know, as a... a single parent. It's just you've dedicated so much of your life to serving your country. I'd imagine that being a hard choice. Any choice that leads to me raising my daughter, having a family, isn't a hard one at all. That is, if I find her. Don't worry. We'll find her. You'll get your family. You'll catch your rainbow. Hey, do you mind if we go and check out the farmhouse one more time? Sure. Look, there's a rainbow! Come on, let's go! No! Whoa. You got that paperwork? Oh, uh, sure. Let's go inside. Nope, we're gonna do this right here, right now. All right, hey, hold your horses. Hey, what, no, um... I win! It's mine! It's all mine! You are now the proud owner of Patty's Pedicures for Pets. - What? - You signed the wrong paperwork. Oh. No, no, hold on. Just... Come on, we're almost there. It's at the house, up ahead. Yeah, I'm... It's here somewhere. Got it. Got it, got it, got it. Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no. Hold on. Hey, hold on now! That's not for the sale of the house, is it? That's right, and you're too late. Now, what's the meaning of this? What? No. I don't understand. It was just here. Holy wow! Whoa. Enough of this circus! It's time to go... Oh. Oh, oh my. Where am I? Hi, Annabelle. I'm Karl. Hi, Karl, it's nice to meet you. Yeah, it's nice to finally meet you. I'm, uh, you're my, uh... What-what I'm trying to say is... - Hi, Dad. - Oh. Where have you been all my life? I've been preparing for this moment, this... this perfect moment. I've been hearing your voice in my dreams, and I didn't realize it before, but I guess Sparkle's been trying to give me hints. - Hey, that's my old watch. - Is it? You know, your mom always believed in pursuing the things you love, even if it seems impossible. "Chase the rainbow." It's time for you to go, isn't it, Sparkle? You think you're pretty clever, huh? Right? And I think I figured you out about the wishes, I mean, the chant pretty much spells it out. I ask of you, my magic steed, not what I want, but what I need. And if you feel my heart is true, then grant me the wish I ask of you. You never granted me the wishes I wanted, only the ones that I needed that led me to finding my dad. Your dad, Annabelle, he's your pot of gold. I'm gonna miss you so much, Sparkle. Thank you for everything. Thank you for letting me use your horn, Emma. Thanks for making us believe again. Bye. I have no what idea what I just witnessed. But I just wanted to say thank you for your service. And I'll give you some time to get things in order if you're interested in buying back the farm. Oh, you bet I am. Thank you. I hope you understand, Mr. Gilmer. Understand? Understand what? Oh, criminy! Time to go milk the cows. Okay. Toodle-oo! We'll talk about your new pet pedicure salon later. You okay? It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It is, isn't it? So Mr. Hart and I will be by later to handle Annabelle's new guardian paperwork. Of course, whenever. No hurry. I'll be busy making some positive changes to the orphanage. I want this to happen for all the children. Good for you. I have a feeling there's gonna be a lot of changes. - Oh. - Hey. Thank you, my dear. Is dinner ready? Well, uh, all I need is some butts in the chairs. Mwah! Annabelle, where's the others at? Oh, I'll go get 'em. Okay, then, let's see it, Jake. All right. - Was it the ace of spades? - No. Was it the four of club? - No. - Dang it. Was it the jack of club? - No, just give up already. - Fine. Okay, dinner's ready. Yes! What was the card? It was the three of diamonds. Whoa! You're getting pretty good. - I know, right. - Thank you. Okay, come on. Oh, really, I hope you guys are hungry. Well, you know, I mean, there's some fresh veggies over there, - we can throw 'em on the grill. - Hey! What's going on? We're having grilled spaghetti. I totally forgot...
