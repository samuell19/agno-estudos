RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM No, no, something less, I don't know... less Christmas-y. Say something like "Seasonal Wishes, Elise MacReynolds, VP of Marketing." No. Don't put the VP. Or. Maybe put the VP? Wait, what? If the CEO is tracking me down before the holidays, put the VP. Order 150 cards. That has to mean I got the promotion. I have another call. Gotta jump. Mom. Your dad's gone and done it. It was on sale! Hank, what are we going to do with a forty pound frozen turkey? It was ON SALE. Forty pounds? I see a lot of turkey sandwiches in your future. Tell me you'll come help eat this beast. Home for Thanksgiving? I can't. I'm about to get a promotion, I need to log the hours. Hon. You haven't been home in a year. No one works 24/7. I get a lunch break? Dad and I are driving the trees down to the city next week. You know Brendel's was sold to that furniture chain, Brook Glen. No, I didn't know that. Fortunately, old man Brendel made it part of the deal that we could still have the same space. Mom, when are you guys retiring? Every year you exhaust yourselves selling those Christmas trees. That's why we have a successful daughter to help support us when we're old and frail. Is there an extra room in that new loft of yours? And with that, I gotta go. Seriously? It's not even Thanksgiving yet, Max. Where's your holiday spirit? Yule Log latte? Coffee. No whipped cream, no nutmeg, no Santa Claus. Coffee. No whipped cream, no nutmeg, no fun. Got us an upgrade. Two words: private cabana. Am I the man? You're my one and only man. When you're with Lance Pinfeld, it's only the best. How's the unpacking going at the new place? Slow. Want to come over later and help me out? Yeah, of course. Hey, Secret Santa. Secret Santa? Why does everyone insist on stupid "traditions" like this? What is it with you and Christmas? You know how I told you I grew up on a farm upstate? Yeah, the town I can't pronounce. No one can. "Skaneateles". That's the one. Well, the farm was a Christmas tree farm. So what's the problem? Every Christmas, since I was a baby, from Thanksgiving to December 26th, my family's driven down to Manhattan and lived in a freezing cold trailer on a street, selling trees. It's the anti-Christmas. You're done with all that now. Beaches. Sand. Sunburns. Keep talking, keep talking... Elise, there you are. Malcolm! I heard you were looking for me. Can we have a word? Shoot. A word. In private? Fired? It's like ripping off a band-aid. Better to just come out and say it. And here I thought I was getting promoted... 3rd quarter sales are in the toilet. I have to downsize, trim the fat. You're saying I'm "the fat". Okay, wrong analogy. Look, you know I've always liked you. But why me? Why not Brandy? She's late every day. She's fired too, she's just not in yet. But it's bigger than that, Elise. We're an athletic shoe company. Look at your feet. You don't fit in. Step Shoes needs to speak to its market. And I don't think you're listening. I'm listening. I listen. Listen, that's me listening. You do your job, but I'm not feeling the passion. The connection. You'll bounce back, kid. Tell me you brought ice cream. I can't actually stay. But you're already here. I know, it's... we need to talk. Why do I get the feeling we're not talking about something good. I'm glad you brought it up. Brought what up? I can't go to the Bahamas. Because of the layoffs. Malcolm is making everyone work over the holidays. I think we should take a break. You're breaking up with me? I didn't say break up. You said "break". "Up" is implied. Look, E. Malcolm gave me your accounts. I'm doing two jobs. I can't do this, too. So that's it? Our relationship was just summed up in a hand gesture? I'm sorry. I did get you this? Let it melt. We're still friends, right? You're perfect. Really? No. If you were perfect, you wouldn't be in a headhunter's office looking for a job. But you're close. Full scholarship. Marketing Director before 30. I could find you a job by Monday. Really? No. Because I got nothing. It's almost the holidays. Nobody hires in corporate at the holidays. So what do I do? Well, hopefully you saved your money and didn't do something stupid like just buy an apartment. Which you did. It has good views? Elise, I'll do my best. Be ready to interview on a moment's notice. Get in here for a hug. Now tell me why you're here. I got fired. And dumped. Oh, hon. I'm so sorry. But it's perfect timing. That's what happens when you drop a 40 pound turkey on your foot. He's laid up until January. My foot's broken, Betty. Not my mouth. I can speak for myself. Oh, Dad! It's not just the broken leg. It's the trees. We only have 6 weeks to sell our Christmas tree stock in the city. Mom, that's your entire income for the year. Cousin Shane was all set to help Dad again this year, but with this... I'm right here. I can hear you talking about me. Shane can't do it alone. Can't you hire someone? The MacReynolds family tree lot needs a MacReynolds running it. Since you're in between jobs, you could come help out? You loved it as a kid. No, I didn't. When you were really little you did. But now I'm an adult. I'm on a career path. Hon, we really need you. If she doesn't want to do it, Betty, don't make her. I'm sure the bank will understand when we're late with the mortgage. Hank, hush it. You're not funny. They want you to do what? Sell trees. All right. We've got a coconut layer, chocolate ganache, carrot, lemon mousse and a cheesecake. Who had a bad Thanksgiving? Her. She'll jog it off. Consider this on the house. I told my mom I'd think about it. What's to think about? It's a job. Something you don't have right now. I swore when I was 14, I'd never work another Christmas at that lot. Elise. It's your family. Exactly. Do you know what it's like not having a real Christmas? I'm Jewish. Every other kid in New York got to run down the stairs on Christmas morning, find a pile of presents from Santa Claus... under a tree that I helped carry to their car... My Christmas? Chinese takeout and a stocking... and one year, my mom forgot to pack them, so it was one of my dad's socks... hanging in the trailer. You lived in a trailer? Who knew Uptown Girl had a gritty past. The trailer's just for the season. New York tree lots stay open 24/7. Nowhere to lock up the trees at night. Sounds like an adventure. But that's not it. Nance, I have a new loft. With a doorman. I'm wearing $300 shoes that I found for $75. I've spent years trying to get away from the farm. Now I'll be back right where I started. Think of it instead as a new beginning. Nowhere to go but up. And if I forgot to say it: it's your family. Mom. I'll do it, I'll sell the trees. Tell Shane I'll meet him at 8 o'clock tomorrow. Coming through, coming through. Sorry, strictly plastic these days. I'm here, I'm here! That old thing. Hey, Cuz. Nice of you to show up. I know, I know, I'm late. Haven't seen you since last year. For the 5 seconds you stopped by. Yeah, I've been busy. You know how it goes. Not sure that I do. Fancy threads for unloading trees. My headhunter told me to be on call. Interview wear at all times. And... wait, unloading the trees? They don't unload themselves. Especially when two more loads are coming this afternoon. I conveniently forgot this part. Need a hand with that? Nope. All good. All of the employees are enthusiastic about this new Brook Glen "brand", Gary. Mr. Dixon. And Dixon is how I was going to finish off that Gary. Now that this is Brook Glen's new Manhattan flagship store, all preexisting employees are on a 30-day trial basis. Including you, Mr. Cunningham. Brook Glen demands a certain standard of excellence. We tried to be "excellent" at Brendel's, too. And look at how that turned out. My staff are professionals. You'll be impressed. What will impress me is sales. I want customers through that door and credit cards on that counter. Three words. Make. It. Happen. Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry! You should be. Who are you? Is this the Christmas tree lot? MacReynolds Farms. What up, Isaac? Elise MacReynolds. You must be the new owner. Nice to meet you. It takes up the entire sidewalk. Yeah, that's kind of what Christmas tree lots in New York City do. Was it this size last year? Pretty much the same every year. The contract stated there was a "quaint" seasonal tree lot, not this hulking eyesore. The trees are blocking the display window. Eyesore? If I could jump in here... I don't care where you jump, Miss, so long as it's not in front of my store. My lawyers will fix this mistake, and then you'll be gone. And someone else's problem. Think that's all bark, no bite? Nope. That one bites. Big time. Forget him. We can find another sidewalk. New York's full of them. No, we can't "find" another sidewalk. All the good ones have been taken for years. If we lose this corner, we lose our spot in Manhattan. Maybe forever. I'm sorry. Hi. Do you work here? Yes? You don't sound so sure about that. The apron doesn't lie. Yeah, but you could have stolen that apron off someone else. I'd pay someone to steal it off me right now. How much are we talking? How much you got? Sorry, dealing with my headhunter. Shane! Shane's better with the trees than me. He knows the brands by names. They're trees, not shoes. It's types, not brands. See? You've got an expert here. Okay. I'll just go browse. Little hint. Might help move inventory if you, I don't know, talked to customers? It's a tree. They're all the same. The customers are either buying one or they're not. This is gonna be a long December. Excuse me, sir. This isn't a hotel? Parking ticket? Wait. You didn't pay for that. Help! Have the presentation ready by 10. Shift's done. Why don't you go into the trailer? Warm up? I've got coffee on. No, thanks. You can have that old junk heap. I'm heading home. No foam, no nutmeg, just coffee. Finally, someone who speaks my language. Reinforcements have arrived. Tell me that's a pizza. No, it's a hat. Of course it's pizza. Pepperoni, your fave. Have I ever told you how much I love you? Yes. Hey. Get a slice now because they won't last long. What's your plan for fixing this place up? What needs "fixing up"? It's a little "meh". Don't you people hang lights and stuff? You know, try and be festive? You're still here. Mr. Dixon! I want to apologize again for the other day. And to make up for it, MacReynolds Farms would like to give you a tree. Free. I don't want a tree. How about for the store? Those display windows that we're not blocking, well, they're kind of beige. They could use sprucing up. Get it? Are you trying to bribe me, Ms. MacReynolds? If so, I'd say your skills need some sprucing up. No. Look, we got off on the wrong foot. It's more of a peace offering. Let me get that... Don't get too comfortable on this sidewalk. That went well. Sh. Get this dry cleaned. Dry cleaning? I don't... Ned. Dixon here. You're my lead counsel. I thought you were in charge of finding a loophole in the Brendel's contract. Well work harder. Or the lot won't be the only thing I get rid of. Mom. Hi. Sweetie, hi! I just wanted to check in. How's it going? Shane doesn't give you updates? He does, but you know him. It's "fine" or "not so fine". I wanted to hear from you. I also wanted to tell you the extra tree stands will be a few more days. We only just got the vendor paid. Honestly, Mom. It's been going "not so fine" at the lot. I don't get why you and Dad have done this for all these years. The lot is hard work, hon. Any job's hard work. But there's joy, too. You're bringing the magic of Christmas to people. Trees represent hope. Hope of what? I know you think I'm a cornball. How about "sentimental"? I'll take it. As for the trees, Dad and I need you to stick it out. We know you're trying your hardest. Thanks. I'll do better. Bye, hon. Love you. Bye. Wait. Mom? Yes? Love you, too. Something's wrong. You're on time. And you're dressed almost normal. Maybe I'm trying to turn over a new leaf. "Branch" out. Get it? Unfortunately, yes. Fine, and my feet really hurt. Excuse me, can we get some help? It's Ben's first time picking out our tree. He's a little shy. Elise here will help you. What? I don't know how to talk to kids. You said you wanted to branch out. You like Christmas, Ben? Yeah, I feel about the same way. Go with the mood, Cuz. It's a MacReynolds family rule: never pick out a tree hungry. Let's see what we have here. Lots of trees to chose from, huh? They even have different names: Balsam Fir, Blue Spruce, Nordmann. Nordmann sounds like someone's grandpa, huh? You know, I grew up on the farm where these trees come from. It's been a while, but let's see if I can remember how to do this... No. No. Not special. Wait. You almost dropped your candy cane. We have a winner. Best tree on the lot! Welcome back. I knew there was a "MacReynolds" in there somewhere. Hook you up with a tree, man? Is she free to help me? Sorry, dude, not right now. She's having a Christmas moment. And our business depends on it. Okay, sure. Show me some trees. The totals for yesterday were off 14% from last year. But it's only Thursday, maybe this weekend... I rushed back from my 12 o'clock for this news? Where's the foot traffic? Well, Mr. Dixon, I think the price... point is a shift for our regulars... No. It's that tree lot. It's driving customers away. Could I have my pen back? No. Shane? Lights? Here you go. Thanks...? Bob. You know, Bob, we could use always another hand around here. You mean, like a job? We can't pay much... That's more than I'm making now. Does that mean you'll take it? Yup. Sounds good. Now we're on the road to festive. Fine, fine. You were right. Missed a spot, kid. Okay, on the count of three, one, two... What is going on here?! Just a blown fuse. This tree lot is nothing but trouble. We can fix it in a jiff. Right, Shane? Yup. Isaac, where's the circuit breaker? It's in the basement. This is about the time you say something to make things better. Mr, Dixon, I am so sor... Do you only exist on this planet to annoy me? Fair enough. But instead of looking at this as a disaster, think of it as an opportunity. How so? Well, it's dark inside, right? Perfect time to sell more of your beige scented candles. The idea was to make it better. Just hand over the sandwich, Nance. Enjoy your hot chocolate. Does your headhunter ever actually text you back? This isn't for her. I'm making a movie. If Mom and Dad can't be here, they can at least see here. Cool! Remember: defense, my man. Let's go find some trees! Break! Hey, hold up. What did that tree ever do to you? Where's your mother? You don't want to be on Santa's naughty list, do you? So is Santa real or not? I can't legally answer that question. You're old. You should know. I am not old. Stay here. Can I help you? Let me guess. Office holiday party. Open bar? Reeeeally open bar. I'm sure the tree is honored to be your confidante, but I need you off. Those are for everyone. ELLIOT! There you are. You scared me half to death! This lady says there's no Santa Claus. What!? I did not! 7 years old and already knows how to score a free tree. I think you need help, dear. No, I got it. No worries... What you need is a big, strong man. I can do it on my own, whoa... Here you go. A big strong man like that. Thank you. It's like that tree had a vendetta against me. It's you again...! I'm sort of a regular by now. I've bought three trees. Three trees? What, are you running a black market Christmas tree ring? While I do court adventure and danger, there's not much demand for secondhand Christmas trees. Get a clue, Cuz. I pass your lot every day on the way home from work. I kept trying to talk to you, but it's not easy. Do a guy a favor? Say yes to coffee? I'm kind of on a self-imposed dating hiatus right now... Doesn't have to be a date. How do I know you're not some homicidal maniac with a sense of humor? Excellent point. My name's Darren Foster. Here's this... Driver's license. Credit cards. Gym membership. Ten years at the YMCA. Impressive. And I'm an organ donor. Healthy and charitable. She's free tomorrow afternoon. What are you, my social secretary? Looks like I'm free tomorrow. I'm going to take that as a yes. I'm Elise. Tomorrow? How's 2? 2 o'clock. Great. And now I don't have to carry another tree home. You won't get off that easy. I'm kidding. See you tomorrow. So, what do you do when you're not stockpiling Christmas trees? I'm a public school teacher in Queens. 4th and 5th grade. Math and Science. My mom's a retired teacher. History. I could go into the whole no funding spiel, etc., etc. But I'll just cut to the happy ending: it's rewarding. Hey, I remember this place. My parents used to take me skating, after the last day of selling trees. My "reward". I haven't been back here in years. Why not? I'm a grown-up now, I guess. Well today? Nobody's a grown-up. So, you learned to ice skate as a kid? More like at birth. I grew up in Skaneateles, upstate. It's a long winter there. Skating's kind of a required skill. And you? Never? It's the first time. You seemed so excited. I got caught up in the moment. Here, give me your hand. I'll take care of you. We'll take it slow. I meant to do that. Impressed? Very. But it's easier to skate standing up. So I've heard. Just don't let go. And here I thought you courted adventure and danger. Actually, right now, I'm just trying to court you. So the secret to skating is to keep your ankles steady. Distract me. Tell me your life story. I've been in Manhattan for awhile. I just bought my first apartment. Nice. I should look into selling trees. Clearly, a better pay scale than teaching. No, the trees are temporary. I work in marketing. Or did. And will again. If my headhunter would ever call. You seem like someone who can probably do anything. Even skating! But hey, for now, the tree lot doesn't seem so bad. Fresh air, outdoors, meeting new people. Like you. Look at you. You're on your own. I have a great teacher. I meant to do that. So I turn around and two of my students are grabbing the pennies out of the museum fountain and stuffing them in their pockets. What? Those are people's wishes! That's what I said. You really want someone else's wish to happen to you? What if that person wished to be a dog? Or to be 60' tall? Or a 60' tall dog? Exactly. They finally put the money back. They sound like a lot of fun. You have a unique definition of fun. Now tell me a tree lot story... I have a lifetime of them. But I'll bore you with those some other time. This is my stop. Don't look now. Our mistletoe finally came! You know the tradition. I'm bad with tradition. Well, I'm not. So when can I see you again? I'm so busy here at the lot, my parents are counting on me. I'm in rebound mode, I'm not sure it's a good idea... I hear you. So, see you around the quad? Yeah. See you around the quad. That was mistletotally uncool. I don't remember asking for your opinion. What's the problem? He blow the date or something? No, the date was wonderful. That's the problem. My life's complicated right now and I don't need to make it any more of a mess. Can't sleep. I'd do anything to sleep right now. Anything? Including going into the trailer? Nope. I'm good. Boo! Give it up. Go inside. Now. But I haven't been inside that thing since I was a kid. It's not a haunted house. Part of childhood is that you leave it behind, right? It's a trailer. You're cold. You're tired. Admit it, you're losing this round. I hate it when you're right. No way. It's not Christmas yet. You open that stocking and you're stuffed. Do you have eyes in your ears or something? Lumpy? Still along for the ride. One car. Two car. Three car. Four car. Five ca... Bob! We need a load-up! Two minutes. P-u-p-p-y. Wait, do your parents know you're asking for this? Good luck, kid. I can't stand it anymore. This has got to end. I thought you were on our side. No. That has to end. No love. Alone on the sidewalk. Would you want to spend Christmas like that? I probably will. It needs a makeover. Those are perfect. Hold on, let me get my wallet. On the house. Seriously? I can pay. Maybe customers will come in and buy ornaments if they see them displayed. Hey, do those come with it? Sure do. I wasn't going to get a tree this year. That tree wasn't going to get a buyer this year. I'll take it, no one likes to be alone on Christmas. Do you know where I can a tree skirt and some lights? Yes sir, right here at Brook Glen. Team effort paying off. Are those Brook Glen ornaments? Yeah? Don't they look nice? "Spirit of Christmas?" Were these ornaments paid for before leaving the store? Sir, I felt working the tree lot to Brook Glen's advantage would... Not the question I asked. No. Consider this an official warning, Isaac. A write-up will go into your HR file. Pull something like this again and you're fired. I can't believe that tree lot hasn't burned this place down. I need a listing. Sure I'll hold. Bye, bye, trees. I dropped the payment off at the bank, and... Mom, let me call you back. If three's a crowd, four's overcrowding. In a moment of starvation, I gave the other trees away to my neighbors. But now my students want to put on a charity event: a toy drive. And we need a tree. How sweet. Knowing them, they're working some angle. But we still need a tree. Sounds like a party. Would you want to come? It's not a "date". We could use the help. It'll be a madhouse. When you put it that way, how can a girl resist? Count me in. Great. It starts tomorrow at 4. Are you... picking me up? Nope. It's not a date, remember? You gonna sell me a tree? No... no... no. That ornament is not a baseball. Hey! You made it. Mr. Darren has a girlfriend? Don't make me pull nap time on you. We're 10. We don't nap. I survived the subway, but not so sure the cupcakes did. Who wants to taste test and find out? Bribery. Whatever works. That doesn't look like a gift. It looks like a mistake. Presents aren't really my thing. Who doesn't like Christmas presents? You Teach's girlfriend or what? No. We're... where's the tape? He's a good looking guy. Maybe you have relationship issues. It's not that... wait, how old are you kids again? Ho, ho, ho. Yo, Mr. Darren. Red's your color. It's not "Mr. Darren". I'm Santa! What were you guys talking about? You know, the usual. Sports...? Yeah, sports. Go Knicks! Knicks fan, huh? We should go to a game sometime. Pick you up in my sleigh. And a candlelit dinner first. I know a great place downtown. It's like they're 10 going on 40. They're right about one thing. Red really is your color, "Mr. Darren". Santa. Mrs. Claus wants the reindeer to stay in the barn at night. But I let 'em in the house. Merry Christmas. Before you go... Merry Christmas. You win. Give me that fancy latte. Wait. Where's Elise? I'm doing it. I'm embracing my holiday spirit. I'm hugging it. You're hugging it. A "Hey, I'm so happy to see you, but you're really not" hug? Or a real hug? Real. With nutmeg on it. We're going to Defcon 1. Bring out the Yule Log Latte. Slow down! Enjoy the season! Here you go. Plastic's overrated. Merry Christmas. Recycle, lady. Thank you Bob. You're inviting your mom. But Dad's bringing Medusa. Lisa. Your dad's new wife's name is Lisa, dear. Can I help you with a tree? You can help with a political stalemate. Mom, Dad, Dad's new wife. Who doesn't get to come to Christmas dinner? Bad divorce equals bad idea. But at some point, everyone has to sit down together. It's not like they have to be best friends, but looks like they'll be joint grandparents soon. Not soon enough. 37 weeks. You're outnumbered. But you don't know my family. True, but I know mine. We're not always on the same page, but we are family. Maybe this year, you can start a new tradition that includes everyone, so no one feels left out. You love every other holiday tradition. And we'll let your mom help decide on the new one. It doesn't even have to be conventional. It just has to work for you. Solid argument. I'm sold. On a tree, too. We'll take it. We're late for our brunch. Do you deliver? Yes, we do. Where do you live? 92nd Street. We're practically neighbors. How's later this afternoon? Perfect. There you go. Thank you. Bob can drop it in the morning. It's on my way home. You deliver trees all the time. How hard can it be. Have a good night, Cuz. Thanks guys. Merry Christmas. Bye! Hi. Hi! Amazingly, it's in one piece. Me? Not so sure. You brought it yourself? I had some Good Samaritan help... Still, you should have said something. Josh could've done it. It's my job. And now my "job" is to insist you come in. Take a load off. This will fix your hypothermia. Your place is charming. Even your mugs are charming. Don't tell anyone, but Josh has a thing for roadside flea markets. My deep, dark secret. He likes to make up stories about who owned the stuff before. Like that mug? Came over on the Mayflower with Captain Shufflebottom. Then it's a honor to be drinking from it. Get ready, tree. I'm trimming. Each ornament has a story. And some of them aren't pretty. This is the Christmas we spent in the Milwaukee airport. Snowed in. We bought it at the gift shop. That might have been the best-worst Christmas ever. Don't even get me started on this. Two years ago. Worst-worst Christmas. Emergency Room. Josh had an appendicitis. I got it at the hospital gift shop. I think we're the only people who actually shop in gift shops. Remember this one? Our first Christmas together. We were in college. The first time you told me you loved me. Best-best Christmas ever. So what about you, Elise? Who's going to trim your tree? Maria! Feel free to ignore her. Well. There is this one guy, but... "But" is the death knell. Let her tell it. He's funny. Cute. A really good guy. Sounds like a catch. I know, but it's complicated. It's always complicated. Take Josh and me. When we met in college, I was summa cum laude and he was in a heavy metal cover band. "Full Metal Skull Crushers"! We rocked it. Keep telling yourself that. But now I'm worried this guy thinks I don't like him. I turned down Josh the first three times he asked me out. Four. But who's counting. I should get going. Here, take my card. I work downtown, at City Hall. Let's have lunch sometime, okay? Great! Hey, stranger. Heading to work? Nope. Field trip today, but I got a hall-pass from chaperoning. I almost called you last night. You should have. I was out with friends. Trivia night. Did you win? If we knew the highest peak in the lower 48 states, we would have. Mount Whitney. Next Tuesday you can be on my team. Can you believe it? My headhunter. Take it, I'll amuse myself. Marge? Tell me I'm a genius. You're a genius? You flatter me. I got you an interview. A VP position at Afleet Footwear. Wait, that's incredible! They're Step's main competitor. Go in and dazzle them, doll. The interview's in an hour. One hour. From now? No, one hour from next Tuesday. But I can't, I'm alone at the lot... I told you to stay on high alert. I have 300 resumes almost as good as yours... Fine, fine, I'll figure it out. Text me the address. You got it. Darren. Are you free right now? Sure? You like trees, right? To look at. Selling them is almost as easy. Cash box is right here. Here's the price list. It's a big VP job. I really think I could get it. UI so owe you one.. No time to change. Do I look okay? No. You look. Perfect. Thank you. Why don't you tell me a bit about your time at Step. Before I left, I was in charge of nationwide branding and regional... That's all on your resume. I'm more interested in the real story. What... real story? Step's sales are down. Any idea why? The economy? C'mon. Surely, you know more than that. Afleet is finally poised to take over the #1 spot from Step. And I'd love to be part of the team making that happen. So wouldn't you rather talk about my "connection" with Afleet? My passion for the brand? Sure, sure, we can get to that. But I'm interested in your insider's perspective of Step. You do realize I was fired from Step, right? I didn't "fit in". You can fit in here at Afleet. We're like a family, we share everything. So, spill. Where are you going? I'm an only child. I'm not that good at sharing. This interview isn't over. It is for me. What's the difference between a Blue Spruce and a Balsam Fir? Different names? A Blue Spruce is hardy and can handle wear n' tear. The Balsam Fir is more easily trimmed. You're back! I'll be right with you. Looks like you survived. Barely. How did it go? I'm not their corporate girl. Can I take you to dinner? Dinner sounds like decent "payback". Actually. I was thinking maybe we could call it a "date". Date? Let me see. Actually. I'm free tonight...? Elise? Lance. I thought I'd find you here. You were looking for me? I Googled your family's tree farm. Fine. You found me. Why? I got the promotion. At Step. The promotion I wanted? There's no one else that gets how big this is. And no one else I'd rather take out tonight to celebrate. Can you say "unlimited expense account"? Maybe I should go... Hold on, Darren. Correct me if I'm wrong: you broke up with me. You said "up". I just said break. I didn't know you looked so cute when you're country. Hey, Elise, about dinner... Didn't realize I was interrupting anything. Darren Foster. Lance Pinfeld. Elise and I are "old friends". So to speak. Yeah, I get it. So tonight? Get you off the street corner and buy you a proper meal? She's free. Darren, wait. Why are you really here? Besides rubbing it in how well you're doing at work... I'm not rubbing it in... Lance. You were never a good liar. E., it's the holidays. You're lonely. I'm lonely. We could "hang out" and reassess in January. So when should I pick you up? Let me see... How's never? Work for you? C'mon, don't be that way. Do you have any idea how much I make now? Why don't you spend some of that money on charm school. Have a nice life, Lance. That's the dude who broke your heart? I know. Absence makes the heart grow smarter. What did I ever see in him? Think I can still catch Darren? Go make me proud. Elise MacReynolds? If this is about a tree, see Shane. It's about all of them, ma'am. I have an order from the New York Fire Department to shut down the lot and confiscate the trees. What?! You can't do this. It's only a few days until Christmas! Just doing my job, lady. Here's the paperwork. The lot's been condemned as a fire hazard. Fire hazard? The lights, ma'am. It shorted the available power supply. But you're destroying my family's business. Don't shoot the messenger. I'm not the one who registered a complaint. It's in the paperwork. "Gary Dixon". A man true to his word. Major bite in that bark, after all. You can appeal to the Fire Department, but that usually takes weeks. It'll be too late by then! What's happening? They're taking the trees. Impounded. It's all over. I blew it. Outta work again. We're done here. It's almost 12. Let's go. Shouldn't you be at the tree lot? Actually. That's why I'm here. Mr. I-Never-Take-A-Nap now does so daily. I think the broken foot has finally slowed him down. But Mom. I failed you. I've failed our family... The lot was doing well before it was shut down. But every day counts since it's your income for the year. Your mortgage... Yours, too. No use in blaming yourself. But I'm the one who made Gary Dixon hate me. Sounds like he hated Christmas long before now. I think I just want to go sulk in my old room for a while. Sure, hon. Dinner's at 6. Where did the tree lot go? It's been shut down. I buy my trees here every year! There's a lot over on 57th? I've been coming to this place since I was a kid... The city hauled away the trees. They said there was a complaint! This man is the CEO of Brook Glen. Why don't you bring it up with him? What kind of a person shuts down a Christmas tree lot?! This kind of person shuts down a Christmas tree lot. Because I can. I don't owe anyone an explanation. Saved the funny papers for you. Not in the mood to laugh. Hon, we'll figure it out. Got a call into the bank, see if we can take out a line of credit on the farm. I can always go back to teaching. And we'll look for a new spot in the city for the lot for next year. Just gotta put off retirement a bit longer, that's all. And you can go back to your career path. You know what? You didn't raise a quitter, did you? Nope. What are you thinking, Elise? That I'm going to give it one last shot. Shane, meet me at Brook Glen. Yes, I said Brook Glen. I'll call you guys later. Nance. It's me. Get dressed. I don't know, whatever you want to wear. Just make it clothes. Quick sec, hon. You should listen to your own advice. I thought I'd find you here. Elise, I... Let me talk first. That "thing" with Lance? It's not a thing at all. Still, I was a jerk and there's no reason you'd do me a big favor right now, but I need help. The lot was shut down. I saw. I'm so sorry... Then you'll help out? For the trees? Yeah. Sure. For the trees. We have to find him. I figured there's strength in numbers. If we can just corner Gary and plead our case, maybe we can make him see reason. Mr. Dixon goes somewhere every Tuesday and Thursday at noon. Maybe to one of the other Brook Glen Manhattan stores? Where are they? Midtown and Upper West Side. We can divide up. Want to be on my team? Your Tango just got a Cash. We'll take the midtown store. Looks like you and me are heading to the Upper West Side. Nice. Good luck. I think I have an idea how to find Gary... This is where Gary goes? He doesn't seem like the botanical type. That's what his driver said. How did you get him to spill? I, gave him my Knicks tickets. Please tell me they're nosebleed seats you'll never even miss. Courtside. I won them in the charity auction at the Community Center. You... did that for me? You weren't the only one who was sort of jerky the other day. I jumped the gun. But c'mon, that's not why we're here. I'll call Tango and Cash and tell them we found Gary. But... I think this moment is all yours. Just speak to Gary from the heart. That way he can really hear you. You believe that? I gave up courtside seats for it. Noelle Dixon was your wife? What are you doing here? I'm here to talk to you. Go away. I have nothing to say. But I do. Now I understand why this has been so hard. This is my private business. You planted this tree. For her? Noelle was a big gardener. Here... in the city? She worked for a horticulture nonprofit. "Greening" Manhattan. But she was originally from Brook Glen. Were yellow orchids a favorite of hers? She loved them. She'd think this was an extravagance. But they're sunny, like her smile. And her laugh. She had a big laugh. Life of the party. She'd laugh at everyone's jokes even when they weren't funny. She sounds wonderful. She was. She loved Christmas. Even though her birthday was the same day, she never minded it being overshadowed by the holidays. Noelle sounds like the kind of lady who didn't live in anyone's shadow. She was all about celebrating the season. She baked fruitcakes every year. Hard as a rock. You could chip a tooth. I ate every bite. And here I spent half my life resenting Christmas. I feel like an idiot. Your wife had the right idea. I assume this attempt at "bonding" is only about saving your family's lot? That was the plan. But plans change. I respect your wish to be alone, with your memories. Merry Christmas, Gary. It's over. What? Unbelievable. What a heartless Scrooge. You gave it a shot... I know, I know. Wait a minute! Noelle would never forgive me. For any of this. She wouldn't believe what a Scrooge I've become. I wouldn't say Scrooge... I'm sure you've said that and worse. Tell me what to do to help out. To bring back the tree lot. I need to do this for Noelle. And for you. Tomorrow's already Christmas Eve... I can make some calls, but almost everyone's gone for the holidays... Not everyone... This is the proprietor, Elise MacReynolds. Pays to know the Deputy Mayor. Pays to know my customers. Thank you, Maria. As you can see, we have the required clearance from the curb. Everything looks good. Just as long as you don't tie into the store's electrical system. Got it. No decorations. No music. No lights. Which means no sales. Nonsense. Let there be light! It's not Christmas without lights. How about we use a generator? Sounds good. You're all set here folks, Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Up high, Gary. Thank you, Gary. We need to make up for lost time. Sales have been down at Brook Glen, too. Mr. Dixon, I truly want to see the store do well... I know you do. Me, too, Isaac. And why don't we make it Gary from now on. Okay. "Gary". Tomorrow's Christmas Eve. We only have one day to pull this off. Let's get it done! Your usual, a Yule Log Latte. Have yourself a Merry Christmas, Max. You too, Elise. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Appreciate it. Thank you. C'mon, make Frosty proud. You really pulled it off. Sales are through the roof. I got to get back inside. Save a tree for me? You got it. Right this way! Gary! Welcome back to your sidewalk. How can I ever thank you? You already have. I was wrong. The tree lot's good for business. And the idea for the Winter Wonderland was genius. Your passion for this place shows. Thanks. I guess there is an upside to being an unemployed marketing exec. The trees, the whole thing here, it "spoke" to me. And now I'm speaking to you. How about you come work for me? I suspect it'll be a good fit. You could make things a little less "beige" around here. Yes. I accept! Okay, okay, don't wrinkle the suit. I'm still the CEO, after all. Sorry, sorry. The baby. It's coming! Good luck. Text us the news! Taxi! A Brook Glen ornament? Is that paid for? I'm going to say this once and never again: it's on the house. I wish Noelle was here. She is. In there. Seems like there's another guy you should be talking to right now instead of me. And I don't mean Shane. Christmas comes every year, but the right person? Only comes once in a lifetime. Hey. Hey. You've been an amazing help today. Even if it was just for the trees. Glad to do it. And the kids had a blast. So... what are your opinions on Chinese food? I'm generally pro. The MacReynolds are mixing up tradition this year. My parents are on their way down to the city. We're doing Chinese takeout at my place instead of the trailer. You could join us, if you're not busy... That sounds nice, but I have plans... Of course! It's Christmas Eve, who doesn't have plans? It's just that I promised... Not another word. And I wouldn't want you to break a promise. See you around the quad. Yeah, okay, sure. See you around the quad. Hey, Elise. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Sold every last tree. Best year in MacReynolds Farms history. Mom, I'm so sorry I was too "busy" these past few years to come visit you and Dad more. And I never really stopped by the lot... Hon, we're your parents. And you're our daughter. We can't get rid of each other. Nancy, we had to use one of Hank's socks for you. But it's clean. It's my first holiday stocking ever, Betty. I'll take it. Space out the ornaments. Three inches between each one. You're a bossy pants. And I like it. So, you have New Year's Eve plans? No, not yet. Yet just happened. Pick me up at 8. Who has the Kung Pao Chicken? It's Josh. They had a baby girl. They're naming her Noelle. Looks like another ornament from the hospital gift shop. We need more mashed potatoes! I used to eat here every Christmas. Now that I have a job, it's nice to give back. I'm all about the giving back. Which is very cool of you. Don't you have somewhere else to go? But now. Isn't it too late? Have a little faith. It's Christmas. Taking a cab, Nancy? Nope. Shane's walking me. Good night. Sure you don't want to stay here? Please, hon, your father never springs for a hotel room... Hey. We can afford it, thanks to how well the lot did today. I plan to enjoy every second of luxury. Merry Christmas, honey. Merry Christmas, Mom. Merry Christmas, Dad. Merry Christmas, sweetie. Goodnight. What did you forget? I forgot to say yes to your dinner invitation. Is it too late? How's cold Kung Pao sound? Sounds perfect. But I want to give you something first. You know, the skating. Holiday date. This is so embarrassing. I got it at the gift shop. That's actually the most romantic thing you could ever say. "Gift shop" is the most romantic thing I could ever say? This is the best FIRST Christmas. Ever. So, are you gonna kiss me or what?
