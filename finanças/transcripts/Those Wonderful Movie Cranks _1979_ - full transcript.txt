The story of this film does not present historical truth as such. The pioneers of Czech cinematography, just like the heroes of this tale, threw in their lot with filmmaking with no hope of profit or fame, just out of their enchantment with these "photos come alive." This film is dedicated to them and all their followers. The Drunkard's Awakening. On a Tightrope over the Niagara Falls. -Right. By Automobile to San Francisco. -I don't want that. All right. A Thief Against His Will. The Revenge of a Russian Orphan. Haha, get along, will you. Okay, fine then. A Visit with Count Leo Tolstoy at the Yasnaya Polyana. -The White Slave Market. -Is that an Italian one? -No, American. -Ah, I see. -Murder on the Express Train. -The African Hippopotamus. -I've got that. -Ah yeah? A Fire in a London Hotel? -Assault in Montmartre. -No, no. -The Transport of Boer Cannons under General Dewet...... -No, no... I don't want that. I want The Mandarin's Execution. All right then. Have it. But you'll have to throw in The Boar Hunt. But The Boar Hunt is my biggest hit. You can have The Old Maid. You can shove The Old Maid up yours... The Boar Hunt or I'm finished here. -The Bombardment of the Fregate from the Island of Crete... -No, no. -Hm, The Assault in Montmartre. -No, no. -The Devil's Kettle, then. -Nope. You know what then, young lad? Too bad. Pity, your dad and I, we didn't haggle. If you care all that much for The Execution, I can sell it to you. For twenty. I hope your ready money never comes to less than a pocketful of coppers. FILMEXPORT PRESENTS THOSE MAGNIFICENT MEN WITH THEIR CRANKING HANDLES STORY BY SCREENPLAY STARRING FEATURING MAGICIAN, ILLUSIONIST, CONJURER MOTION PICTURES, PHOTOGRAPHS COME ALIVE THE MIRACLE OF THIS CENTURY You're asleep. Sleep, Marion. You're asleep. Oh, you wretched daughter of mine! You wish to bring disgrace upon our family name with such an unequal marriage. That'll be the end of me. Says he. Get out of my sight, I never wish to see you again, says mother. How sad and dour the atmosphere at Chateau Hohenlohe. Ah me, haven't you grown? Damn it all. What the hell are you doing here? You should've been gone ages ago. We did not arrange this. Benjamin, this isn't... Benjamin. William, I've been waiting for you. This has been going on for four months now. -We can't leave the place. -Shut the door, damn it! There's a draught here. Cold as all hell. Shut the door, damn you! We've had to pawn almost everything. Ah... Even Lumiere. -Forgive me, I'd no idea... -But the tapes, William. The tapes I've saved for you. Wait now. Tragedy at the Bois de Boulogne. Love in the Tyrol. The American Ladies' War. William, I'll give them all to you. Only please... Look after the girl for me. You know, the world's an evil place. A girl all on her own... William, William. Just look after my girl for me. Lumiere really does bring light. Where've you been for so long? -Eugenie. -Don't lie to me, will you? It's been a terrible year. I had to revamp the program three times. In the end they all left me, and I was left alone with Josephine. -Hm, who's the girl? -This girl? She's an orphan. Benjamin died at Christmas and asked me to look after her. She's his daughter, you see. So I'm looking after her. You'll have to pay your rent in advance this time. You've lost weight! How's your husband? I said, how's Slavík doing? Still sick? Don't you know? He died eight months ago, poor man. Widowhood becomes you. Now then, you're not going to wear this thing again. What's here that I could let you have... There, you're going to wear this, so I don't have to feel ashamed of you all across Prague. And I'll give this to the girls so they look nice on the streets. Now then, lift those arms. And now turn around. -And we can keep them? -Of course you can keep them. But won't it look silly? Silly? How can a dress I used to wear look silly, girl? This one suits you. We'll take it in a bit more here. There now. Pull it up a bit higher here. There you go, Josephine. And do you know that I was slimmer than you are, at your age? Really. I was as slim as a wand. A girl like a willow switch. Good heavens, the husband is back. Good morning, darling. Ha, who's that you've locked up in the closet? Sorry, I'm overworked. I'm seeing things. Typical Frenchman, ha? Where's he gone to? I must be mad. God, he's coming back. Where's the man from inside this coat? Open up! Yeah, another surprise, what? Faithless wench! Where's my hat? Ah, here it is. Well, what do you say to that, gents? Fun, eh? Great fun. Haha. Well, gentlemen, how much? -Fifty. -Fifty-five. -Fifty-five, right. -Hatvan. -Sixty. -One hundred. -One hundred. A hundred, right. A hundred it is. Well, let's continue. And now something classical, gents. The Three Musketeers by Dumas. Absolutely new, just been rushed in. This minute. Excuse me. Good morning. A little faster, Mr Holoubek, so we get it over with. Well, that was all, gentlemen. -A hundred. -One hundred. One hundred. Gone. Oh by the way, gents, this is Mr Kolenatý. Hello, good morning. He makes his own tapes, he wants to show you his films. Gents, how about a bite to eat, or a drink? Miss Milka! -What's this? -Views of the Lesser Prague district. These are the New Castle Steps. Right, typical Czech. And these are the Lesser Town roofs. Halt! Mr Kolenatý, you don't have to bring such goods in here again. What's the good in that? Mr Secretary, the new record, please. And now, gents, I have something special to show you, from Paris. Now then, damn it! Hey there, Mr Kolenatý, wait for me! Don't let it worry you! Just look around, my man. Everything comes from Germany, France, England, America. Not a single thing Czech. And now imagine a film that would be purely Czech. You could have a go. But this sort of thing always wins over any domestic effort. I have a head full of projects. There, see. What we need is a real-life story, something that would prove to be a true sob-story. What's the good of even trying? Just the costs alone... A 17-metre negative to send to Lyon, including postage, that's 39 crowns. Ten litres of developer, 18 crowns. Not to mention the other costs. Don't think I haven't tried. I shot this at Kampa, for instance. The Potters' Market, people around and such. Here I had a shot of the potter working. But they lost it. Here are the beggars at Kampa. They've thrown me out with that too. Said nobody was interested in such things. But who's going to know some years from now what Kampa once looked like? You're right. They're interesting shots. -Oh, go on. -No, seriously. What do you do your filming with, anyways? With this. You put the cassette in here and change the lens. -Oh, so that's the Lumiere? -Yes, a model ten years old. What a thing. Today there're machines with cassettes for 70-meter projection and more. One can do all sorts of things with such a model. Let me show you something. If you want me to? Please do. Where is it? Ah here. Look here. My detailed drawing of the Lumiere adaptation design. Here you see two large cassettes, feed motion with the aid of shafts, and gear transmission. Technically faultless. Do you know how much the mechanic asked for? Three hundred. What do you think of acted sketches? Comedies, for example? Stupid stuff. Silly ditherings. The moving photograph is a document. I was there when the foundation stone was set down for the Palacký memorial. I filmed it. And when the Franz Joseph Bridge was opened. Here are the Prague Sokols, practicing for their performance. In Paris they shot that famous actress, Sarah Bernhardt. Why shouldn't I make a documentary of one of our famous Czech actresses? -For example, Emilie Kolářová-Mladá? -I wonder as well. Damn it, that's a glitch. -I'd better not show you that. -Wait, leave it on. There, that's when we tried to make an acted sketch. A comedy. Christ, that was a fiasco. That's Jára Šlapeta, isn't it? Yeah, and he gave me what for, that fella. He kept on at me, saying, let's share the costs, we'll make tons of money. Tons of money, like hell. All we got was this disgrace. And bills to pay. I'm still paying it off, that was real money. Where's Šlapeta working now? I haven't seen him for ages. I've no idea. I haven't seen him for donkey's years either. And to tell you the truth, I don't particularly miss him. Maybe he sings in the Schuster wine-cellar, for all I know. But you do have somewhat of a mess here, don't you? -What you need is a housekeeper. -Go on, will you? I can't even pay my rent at times. What would I pay such a keeper with? Ouch! -Is this your card? -No. Joseph, what are you up to? Joseph! We want the moving pictures! What sort of a magician are you? Do your magic tricks and be quick! -Just take a closer look, Joe! -No! -Patience brings roses. -We want the movies! We want the movies! We want the movies! Your wish is my command. Marion! -Thanks, Frankie. -It's Joseph! And now, most honoured audience, you'll see several unique movies of sensational import. The first will be a movie imported from the USA, never as yet seen in Prague: The American Ladies' Fight! And now, ladies and gentlemen, the film about American sportswomen will be followed by another, a story of true love, called The Heart in the Tyrol. Watch this. Oh come on, what's this? -Let me be! -Come with me. -Get outta here! Ouch! Get the sand. Quick! Fire! Fire! -Ouch! -Excuse me. Come on. Keep calm. Leave quietly, please. The show is over, no money refunded. Come and visit us again soon! What a fiasco. Goose-fat is best for that. Come and help me, girls. Damnation. This is the last straw. Stupid girl, you're pouring it in my eye. Wring it out, ouch! -Take his other hand. -You must be crazy. Ouch! Have you gone nuts or... Let go. This is torture. That's what happens when one puts in one's lot with the artsy crowd. Turning this house into a brothel. Keep still. Be glad the whole house didn't burn down. In that case you'd never manage to get out of debt to this lady. You slut! You bitch! -Don't you dare touch me again! -Keep calm, daddy. They'll choke each other to death and we can run away together. This fury of a bitch must leave the house! -Here I am again! -Well, glad to see you... A little surprise. Here. Remember, you told me that you need a housekeeper. So here she is. Her name is Aloisie. -Good afternoon. -But I don't have... That's not even worth mentioning, just for her room and board. And she'll be doing the projections afternoons and evenings, of course. Well, get to work, dear. You do have a maid's room, don't you? -Yes, of course, but... -This is for your rent. Just to show you I'm serious. Do you smoke? No, I don't. But please do. You're right not to smoke. A disgusting bad habit. A nice day today, isn't it? Excuse me. Just a little accident. Fell from a horse. That's nice... That's my work. Documenting architecture. -I have a proposition for you, Mr Kolenatý. -Yes? I'll arrange the shooting of Emilia Kolářová-Mladá, and you will make a film for me, an acted scene according to a libretto I shall bring in. What do you say to that? -And you mean... -Don't worry, it can all be arranged. -And there's no financial risk involved. -Yes. So that's agreed. Be a good girl. And that guy... Šlapeta, I'll find him. In Prague in spring, I'm full of rejoicing, when I meet a girl that's meek I pinch her on her rosy cheek, the girls in Prague are all so nice and round, lips like roses, white as doves, they're just made for love. I walk out into the streets overcome with love for beauty... This is my Louise all sweet, all rosy and neat, honey-sweet lips and blue eyes. Whenever she smiles at me life feels just fine and free, but when I get a closer peek she ups the bucket at me... But pretty though she be, she knows just all about me, with me she just fools round, but with richer guys she lies down! Oh, don't speak to me of Kolenatý. He kept on at me, that we'd share the expenses, make tons of money - yeah, says he. You won't leave us alone, hussies! I don't have to tell you how much it cost me. Took me three years to recover. -Oh no, not another word about him. -Wait, old chum. Here's a chance of participating in a serious, truly Czech project. Production and business, hand in hand, in this company. But it needs a brain capable of making comedies so funny they'd make people cry. -Think so? -Jára, old chum. I need a man full of ideas, scenes, situations, sketches, see? And I need somebody capable of acting them all out, you know? Just a minute, Willie. Breakfast. What a lovely smell. What a heavenly smell. -Watch out, or I'll spill it. -I'll cop it. Ouch. Well, my magic tricks are over. These fingers of mine are no longer capable of much abracadabra, I'm afraid. How do you mean to make a living then? I had a beautiful dream last night. Just imagine. Just the two of us. You and me. And we're founding a certain small family business. Wait. A cozy little cinema with unlimited guarantee. For my money. In my auditorium. You don't have a cinema license anyway. Unless... Don't you think your daughter needs a mother at last? What for? I told you she's... And I'm telling you it's high time you got married. Well I haven't thought about that. Here you go. A concession for a permanent cinema? -Are you insane? -Do I look it? A permanent cinema? In one spot all the time? -Yes. -You'll go bankrupt within a year, good man. But then again, that's your affair. Come back... Next week. What're you doing over there? Go away. Go away! Turn and hum, my spinning wheel, the advent is nearly over... That's enough. -Turn and hum, my spinning wheel... -Turn and hum, my spinning wheel... More feeling into it. More joyfully. -Turn and hum, my spinning wheel... -Turn and hum, my spinning wheel... -The advent is nearly over... -The advent is nearly over... And Christmas is right at the door. Where were you yesterday afternoon? I went to the cinema yesterday. The cinema? You could have watched Mary Hübner at the National Theatre yesterday, but instead you went to the cinema? And you want to be an actress? The cinema, indeed. Excuse me, Madame. Mr David Slavík. Wait for me, wait for me next door. Ask him in. Madame, kindly permit me to introduce myself. There's no need. Your name comes in close connection with a great joy of mine. Permit me to thank you sincerely for your kind interest, Sir. -Hardly worth mentioning. -Please take a seat. -Thank you. I can hardly believe it. Madame, for thirty-five years I haven't had the courage to thank you other than by way of applause. I've seen you in all your parts. You are invincible. I saw all your premieres. And I stood in the crowd backstage after each and every play. I own your photograph. I had your portrait painted according to that photograph. But all that is as nothing. I want you, alive. I mean... forgive me, forgive me. I mean - recorded alive. Your face, your eyes, your lips. Your gestures, your... forgive me. I got carried away. Excuse me. Dear friend, your warmth is most touching, Sir. Most of my admirers have forgotten me. Out of sight, out of mind. Time cannot be stopped. Not time as such. But a second, a minute... Several minutes can be preserved for all eternity. You're a magician. Madame, permit me to arrange your cinematography session, of course at my costs. One of your immortal monologues. -The cinema? -For purely private ends. I shall think about it. Amalie is happy, happy as a lark, that she's young and pretty, that I'm her young spark. What do you say to that? Did you recognise me? The guy who did the singing, that's me. This is the very first phonographic recording in this country. And just imagine, Willie, setting it up to play simultaneously with the pictures. That would be a hit, wouldn't it? -Yeah, a fairy tale come true. -But why, after all... Jára, chum, all this is just between you and me, right? For sure. I wasn't born yesterday. But now that you mention it, I've got a swell first-class idea. Just imagine: it's night, husband's coming home. From the pub, of course. And back home, his wife is waiting to spring at him from behind the door. Wait, with rolling pin and all. Haha, what'd you say to that? Isn't that awfully funny? Hush. -Good evening. -I'm a little late. Hush, come on, then, come on. I've been... It was ever so interesting. -All right. You can tell me later. -Yes, well... -Mind the neighbours don't hear. -Yes, please... No, you don't believe me. It was just awful. But I do believe you. Now then, go to bed, love. Tomorrow we can talk about it. Get up, you rake! Where were you? Just look at yourself, you're a sight to behold! This is what you call a decent life? Get outta here! -All right, all right. -I knew it right from the start. This whole family cinema business is just a bee in your bonnet. -Stop shouting, pretty please. -This was the last time, mark my words! -Shall we go, daddy? -Where would we go, Pepi? -I didn't catch your name, I'm afraid. -Tuháček, René Tuháček. Fine mechanics and optics. A first-class company. -Please come in. -The factory-owner, Mr Slavík, sent me. He said you'd know what it's about. Well, where is the machine? -Here. -Ah, this is the Lyon Lumiere. My oh my. What's the matter with it? Here. Just look at this. Wait a second. Who's going to pay for this? Mr Slavík, of course. He's placed his deposit already. Pepi, pop over to the tobacconist's and get me a box of cigars. One more copper. Get just two. The better ones. I don't want God knows what out of you. I'll return it all. Just as soon as I get the biz going. I'll pay it back to the last penny. Do understand. Just imagine what a chance this is. -The first permanent Czech cinema in Prague. -You'll get no money from me. You'll have food, a roof over your head and some clothing, if need be. But not a single crown. Here are my papers, my birth certificate, certificate of domicile, my certificate of probity, my addresses, permanent and temporary. Here I read that your father was a craftsman. And you? So your dad's business wasn't good enough for sonny, right? My dear sir, the city of Prague must protect itself. What a circus this would be if any of these itinerant comedy acts should settle down here permanently. What if I got married? To a property-owner. A bourgeois house, a large hall. And so on. Well, that would certainly change the situation. -Well in that case, here's your certificate of domicile. -Yes. Your birth certificate, your certificate of probity. -And what is this? -My religious parish. -Right, we'll let you know in writing. -Thank you. Goodbye. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Next, please. Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet. Goethe, Faustus and Madeleine. -Margaret. -I beg your pardon? -Margaret. Faustus and Margaret. Ah yes, thanks. Schiller's Jeanne d'Arc. You've seen that? Of course, you saw all my great premieres. -And Hermione in A Winter's Tale. -Hermione... -And you definitely saw the premiere of Vojnarka. -Vojnarka... -Of course I saw Vojnarka. -What a fantastic success. -How many curtain calls did I have? -At least a hundred, Madame. -No, you're exaggerating, Mr Slavík. -Well, I don't know. I'll forgive you. And after the premiere... All that happened after the premiere... Aren't you feeling well? That's all right. So here's the cassette. I hope you'll be satisfied. Should you need anything again, please turn to me with confidence. -Tucháček and co. -Thank you, goodbye. -After the premiere of Mary Stuart... -Madame, forgive me. I've actually come to say goodbye. I'm leaving. By steamer, overseas. A business trip. -Soon? -In a week. I'm taking your photograph with me. I was hoping to be able to take... Let's not call it cinema. It'll be an artistic recording, David. CZECH CINEMA! NEW DOMESTIC MOVIES PSOGLAVS Impressive! THE GHOST OF LESSER TOWN Terrifying! THE PLOUGHMEN OF ŘÍP Breathtaking! DOWN THE BROOK BY WASHTUB Hilarious! Starring Mrs Emílie Kolářová-Mladá Beautiful. -Well, what's the matter? -I'm ready. When I wave my hand, we can start. -I'm ready. -Please start. Against my will and cursed by shame, I submit to that curse of mine and confess my love of you. But my plea was different. I came to beg you to save my son. And only my despairing heart is guilty of how my lips have overflowed with this turmoil in that heart. Ah, I am not afraid. Punish me for my depraved love. You, who just like your father before, may become a hero. Save the world from a monster as none was monster ever before. I, wife of Theseus, bear a monstrous love for you. No, I must not shrink from your own hand. Here is my heart! That grateful target. Ah, ah, ah! Stop. Madame, are you all right? -Yes, everything is fine. -Madame. -Was I good? Did it tell all? -Madame, I have no words. -How about having a repeat of that scene? -Why, why? -I'm afraid we can't afford that. -Bravo! Excellent! That's gonna be one helluva film! Bravo, this is fantastic. Madame, lemme tell you, something like this, with such ladylike temperament, that's a sight to behold. -So pleased to meet you. -A cabaret! A show! -Coming up with this at last... -The recording must be destroyed! -Impossible, you'll become immortal! -I'm not interested in circus fame. -Madame, permit me to... -Hynek! -Just a moment, that's mine! -Give it to me! -Catch him! -Have you gone mad, man? -Halt! -Halt indeed, old fart! -What's gotten into you? -I'll show you! -What have you done? -Madame. -Is this supposed to be me? -Not any more. By exposing it to the light, you've destroyed it for good. The recording cannot be used? So I shan't see myself? -No, Madame. -All the better. Hynek. What a fiasco that was, eh? And how much did that spiel cost you? Dad, there's a letter for you. You'll be dead and buried before you manage to wear out these five suits of David's. Everything out of real English wool. Custom-made. And wait till you see his fur coat. He only wore it three times tops, poor fella. -Surely there's no frost anymore. -Of course a coat's enough for now. You can make your choice. My God, where's the third coat? -Eugenie, dear, I needed some... A certain sum. -This is the end! You took the coat to be pawned, I'll take you to court. Come now, love, do understand. It was only for a few days. Eugenie, my dear. Ouch, ouch, ouch. Pack up and go! What a way to pay me back! Dear God, this is what I get for all my goodness. I never want to see you again. As long as I live, do you hear? What is it? -What did she hit you with? -Don't even ask. What's important... Do you care for her? Of course you do, because you know she's got the little yellow tinklers. -It's not that much. -Not that much, he says. But it's enough for a very good life. She isn't ugly either. And even if, you're no young hunk yourself. Your fingers won't do as they're told either, so what. -Let's go and talk to her, shall we? -I have to keep out of her sight now. But why, come on. Let's down a few for courage. -Oh no, not that. -What? -She won't let me in. -Yes she will. Why shouldn't she? You just leave that to me. She'll let you in all right. Wait, that wasn't a full one. Let me see. That scoundrel! Hush, come on now. Be quiet and stand up straight. -I'm standing. -Willie, wait! -Who is it? -Šlapeta, Jára Šlapeta! My humble salute to you, Madame. -How dare you? -Permit me to bow to your beauty. -Madame, you are an orchid. -Hush. You're the loveliest blossom ever to bloom on this earth. -For God's sake be quiet, will you. -What? -I told you... But Madame, you couldn't be angry if you tried. Because you know very well that who gets angry grows wrinkles and who doesn't love, loses weight from lack of love. I can see in your very eyes what your heart holds secret even from you. Feed the hungry... Tell him to eat. Look what you've done to us, Madame. I've gone all poetic and he's kneeling in front of you. Just look what you've done. We are men at the top of our form, mature and worldly, and you've been playing on the very harp strings of our souls, Madame. Well, you speak well, but you don't know what he's done. Haha, I've caught you out. You're smiling, actually giggling. I'll show you what's what, you little snake in the grass. How's it done, I say? C'mon, we went over this. -Eugenia. -Go on. -Will you marry me? -Now then. I understand you. There, you see. That's that, you fool. That's how you do it. You scoundrel! Was good. ANOTHER ONE OF SARAH BERNHARDT'S ROLES RECORDED ON CAMERA Ouch! Ouch. When do you want to go to bed? It's not worth it anymore. I'm going to make a shot of the sunrise over Prague. Can I come with you? You're still here? Go to bed, please. I have to do it all over again now. Look. Oh, I nearly forgot. That letter. -What about it? -Shall I throw it away? Read it, will you. I haven't got my glasses. Dear Sir, we hereby grant your application for a non-transferable permit to hold cinematic performances in the Old Town of Prague, under the name Blue Fish Cinema. Kindly appear on the 15th of this month, at the Royal and Imperial Governor's Office to sign and take over the licence. Please take your marriage certificate with you. Royal and Imperial Governor. Shall I peel an egg for you? Whoa. -Are you happy, my little turtledove? -Yes, darling. And you? Of course I'm happy, because you're happy. Like in every good film. Yes, all our films will have happy endings. -Which films? -The films we're going to make now. But darling, now you're an honourable Prague burgher. -And soon the owner of a Prague cinema. -Damn it all. I need a hit to start with. Something original, otherwise I shan't make it. Oh no, you don't, not that. You're not leaving the house. Meaning you've tied me to the house by my foot? William, is that what you tell me, right after we've come home from the altar? I've given you a roof over your head, I've fed you and clothed you, I've been looking after that orphan of yours as if she were my own. And you, instead of gratefulness are thinking of trouble right away. You didn't marry my money. I'm telling you that straight. Let go. There's limits to everything. I don't want to get into trouble. We shall start a new life. I'm extremely magnanimous, but there's limits to everything. From today onwards no more chums, no more boozing, no nightlife, we'll take trips in the fresh air. We're gonna live like decent folks. I hear you've got married and opened a cinema in Prague. -Congratulations. -Thanks a lot. -Mr Pasparte? Good morning. -Good morning. -Do you have a minute to spare? -Of course. What for? This way, please. -Madame. -I've been thinking about what happened, dear friend. I must say you're right in a way. You know, the whole of our nation helped build that Golden Chapel. And yet - how many Czechs can really visit our National Theatre? Under certain circumstances your cinema performances could really... Madame, I'm amazed. Our people are wise, but simple. We cannot educate them, ennoble them by art alone. Maybe it would be better to get in touch with your friend Šlapeta, and to make good use of his fame, and to alternate spiritual art with folk entertainment. I do understand that such a matter would entail certain financial risks. I decided to cover the whole project from my own sources to begin with. Madame, you would be willing to... I was thinking that you should make an artistic recording of the stories from the Old Czech Legends by Professor Alois Jirásek. The legend about Princess Libuše would be the most suitable. Libuše foretelling the glory and fame of Prague. -That'll be me. -Yes. Thank you. Now then, you stand here, and you stand there. And you, gentlemen, right behind that rockery garden. -Well? -We're ready. -Now pay attention, please. When I say so, you'll all kneel. Thank you. Kindly watch me, everybody, and do as I say. -Mr Frič, how about the sun? -It's okay. -Ready? -Two cranks and you can start. You can go now, Hynek. We're about to start. -As you say. -Kneel. I see a great city whose fame and glory...
