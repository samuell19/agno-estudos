[rap song playing] [pilot] Cabin crew, prepare for landing. We need to prepare for landing, sir. [music continues] -Sir. -Keys. [music continues] [music fades] [ringing] [ringing stops] -[string quartet playing] -[glasses clink] [indistinct chatter, laughter] [line ringing] You still can't get through to him? Maybe something has happened. The only thing that has happened is that your son has continued to show a lack of respect for me and this family. -[glasses clink] -[cheering] [upbeat music plays] [Chris] Ooh! -"To my Bassey." -Yep. "To keep him warm on those cold, long nights." -[chuckles] Wow! -I mean, yeah. It's what we do. It's what we do. -This Nigerian... -[Chris] Mm-hmm. -...Russian-American supermodel... -Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. ...has the honor of calling me her boyfriend. -[all] Bassey! -Yay! That's it. Touch me, please. Touch me. -[hailing continues] -Yeah, man. Dude, who is this Tony Too Tall liking her? It's just her ex. [stammers] A fake model guy. He thinks he still has a shot, -but we are in there. -Yes, we are. -You know it. -[Isaac] Wait, wait, wait. But, uh, she's liking his pictures, too. -[phone rings] -[sighs] I'm sorry. -Hello? -[Idara] Bassey, get home now. Okay, I have to run. [Idara] Where have you been? What is wrong with you? I was chilling with my friends. What is the big deal? A car was sent for you to bring you here for lunch with my friends. -I didn't know. I would've made a-- -You would've what? All you needed to know was I require of you to come home. -I'm not a child anymore. -Then act like a man. A man who understands his responsibilities to himself and to his family. [phone rings] Hey, baby. Bassey, honey, I miss you already. What time is it over there? It's a little after 7:00 a.m. Where are you? I'm at the Vogue mixer. Just stepped out to check up on my baby. Katrina, we're taking pictures. Hold up. Is-- Is that Tony? Yes, baby. He's also at the party. I'll talk to you later, okay? I miss you. [blows kiss] You're not ready? -Ready for what? -For work! [dish clanks] I'm sorry. I'll go get ready now. We have a meeting with Otunba Adetola of Lotus Construction. I thought you wanted to wait. I've changed my mind. Why does he need to see me? He wants to be sure you're a suitable match for his daughter. A suitable match for-- Okay, um... First of all, no. That's not going to happen. So... Young man... Let's not pretend you're man enough to test me. Be in the office at 9:00 a.m. [rap song plays] [music fades] -Ah, there you go. [chuckles] -What's up, Daddy-o? How you doing, Pops? You good? Hey, Mr. A. How you doing, Mr. A? You good? How are you? What's going on? You... You're not... You're not drinking this, are you? Um, Chief? -My Chief. -Yes. I think we should postpone this meeting -to another day. -Whoo! [whispers] That's the good stuff. At least until he's more settled. -Yes, I... I agree with you. -Okay. -Uh... -Hmm. Folarin, uh... I will, uh... -You be good. -...propose we meet at the club -for 6:00 p.m. today. -Okay. -We have a lot of things to discuss. -Yes, absolutely. Good morning, Mr. Bassey. Hello, sweetie. Um, I need to update you on your NYSC plans. -About my what plan? -Your NYSC plans. NYSC? [Chief] Do you know what you have done? I have worked on this partnership with Lotus for years. Why is that my problem? Bassey, I have been lenient with you. Funded your lifestyle. All that is over. You will do your duty. My duty? Why is this my duty? I never asked you for any of this. Idara would do a much better job running your company than I ever could. This is about you, not me. Don't test me, boy. Don't you test me. You will not win. And you will not accept that this will never be me. I'm going home. -[Katrina on phone] No... -[Bassey] I'm telling you. He wants me to marry some girl. Why? To-- To foster his corporate empire. It's almost like -we're stuck in the Stone Ages. -Oh, babe. Well, just remember, no trust fund baby could ever do this for you. -Chai! You're so wicked. I love you. -[chuckling] You're so sweet. Talk later. [sighs] -Dapo. -Sir? Abeg, take me to the suya spot. Here's your order, sir. [beep] There's no money for your card, sir. Should I try it again? Give me the card. Give me the card, my-- [groans] [grunts] -Excuse me, sir. Please don't-- -Please, leave me! Leave me! -[indistinct chatter] -You can't go in there! You canceled my cards? Here's your new card. Your new monthly allowance will be 50,000 naira. Fifty-- [mutters] How am I supposed to live on 50,000 a month? You will get more if I feel you deserve it. Sis... -[chuckles] -[door slams] I've decided that I won't give in. I won't work for you. I won't marry that girl. It's my life and I will live it as I see fit. Yes. I have to be on a call with Idara at 3:00 p.m. Okay, sir. I'll patch you in on the plane. Good. Thank you, Gloria. Well, I've been arranging for Bassey's NYSC, and, um, I arranged for a doctor to get him exempted with a note. -No. -I'm sorry, sir. Don't arrange for any doctor's exemption. Now tell me more about his service. Bauchi? I'm not going. I'm not going to Bauchi. Bassey, you don't have a choice. You will not be welcome in this house until you have completed your NYSC in Bauchi. I'm 32! Graduated before you were 30, so you still have to serve. But I work for the family business. You are going to be the CEO of a publicly quoted company. You think you can do that without serving? [groans] We're not even publicly quoted! Lotus is. And after the merger, we will be. And one of these days, you'll be CEO. Sis, please. Say something, please. -It's only for three weeks, Bassey. -Three... Three... It's only three weeks! [humming] Sorry, sir, you cannot leave. Excuse you? [clicks tongue] You leave for Bauchi this morning. My friend, get out of my way. I'm going for my run. Okay. Okay. [door shuts] Idara, what are you doing here? Seeing my little brother off to camp. [sighs] I can't believe this is actually happening to me. You know what? It might... It might actually be good for you. It might actually be my worst nightmare, okay? Okay, well, until then... here is 300K. Take it. And there's 700 on the card. [Bassey exhales] Oh, wow. Good luck, little bro. -Thank you. -You'll be fine. [Katrina on phone] I want to know everything. Make sure you send me videos. Nah. This is not the kind of trip we want to remember. For every video you send me, I'll send you one of mine. And you know how my videos can be. [muezzin calling] So welcome to my prison, where I will be spending the next three weeks. -Um... -All the best, sir. Hey, red shirt. Come. Come, come. [engine starts] Be a good lad, yeah? When you finish, um, dropping your bags off, you help me with mine, yeah? There's cash in it for you. 2K. -[in Pidgin] See this guy waiting here? -Yeah. He will help you. Just tell him. -This guy? -Yes, this one. He will help you. Hey. This guy will collect 1000 naira only. Just give him 1000-- -1000? -Don't worry. Yeah. Go, man. Go, go, go. -Thanks, bro. -[speaks Hausa] Hey, man, listen, um, carry those bags inside for me. That's 1K now. And one more when you finish. [mutters] Go down! -Go down. Go down! -Go down. [man] NYSC camp is not your father's. [mutters] [man] Give way. Give way. Give way. [Sadiq] Guy? Don't bother. -[door creaks] -[chattering] I told you not to bother. This guy... Why are you still here? Haba, haba. I don't want you dead. But I have a bed for you. And how much is that gonna cost me? Ten K per night. Ten K per... Thank you very much. I'm fine. I don't need your help. Take care. [indistinct chatter] [sighs] [chattering, indistinct] [sighs] Okay, fine, 10K per night. [in Hausa] Oh, no, rich boy. [in English] The price has gone up. 12K per night. -Fine. Whatever. 12K. Let's go. -[laughs] [in Hausa] Where are you going? [in English] You have to pay. Up front. Cash. Hmm. [in Hausa] Come. [in English] Welcome to the palace, my friend. Eh? Eh? [laughs] How did you get this space? We did a deal with the soldiers. It even comes with our own bathroom, but we have to fetch our own water. -We have to fetch water? -Yeah. I don't understand. [laughs, in Hausa] Rich boy. You know what, you understand. [in English] You will understand, my friend. [laughs] [bugle call plays] [in Hausa] Rich boy, time to wake up. Oh, this guy. I've paid you your money. Go away. Otondo corper! [groans] Move! Roll fast, my friend. [indistinct chatter] Eyes open! Otondo. -[in Hausa] My friend, how are you? -How are you? [chuckles] Rich boy, do you want to eat? No, thank you. [groans] [exchanging greetings] -Hey, Sadiq. -Yeah? Thank you for trying to wake me up this morning. -You're not a corper. -Neither are you. -[laughs] -Have some suya. [indistinct chatter] [in Hausa] Well done. Good work. Eat. Eat. Eat. Eat. Eat. Eat. Eat. Eat. [continue chanting] [cheering, laughing] [farting] [defecating] -I see you-- -[laughs] [all chattering, laughing] [bugle call plays] [muttering] [mutters] [chuckles] -[in Hausa] Hi. -Yeah, let's go. [groans] [laughs] [no audible dialogue] Sorry, let me take this call. Hello. Bassey, Bassey, calm down. Calm down. Don't tell me to calm down. What if they catch us? -They're not going to catch us. -That's what you say. Who sneaks out of camp for suya? It doesn't make sense. It's not any suya. It's the best suya in the whole of Bauchi. People travel from out of Bauchi to come and eat this suya. Do those people get punished for eating suya? That's what's going to happen when they catch us. -For the last time, they're not-- -Hey! [panicked shouting] [soldier] Stop there! Stop! Stop! [Bassey] Hurry up! [Sadiq] What do you think I'm doing? I'm running. I'm running. Catch him. Catch him. -Twenty-seven. Make it faster. -You will tell us who was with you. -Yes, yes, yes. -Go down. Officer... -I've never seen them before in my life. -Lies. Hmm. You've never seen them before? For saying that, 50 more for you. Go down. -Okay. -[commandant] That's enough! [speaks command] -[coughs] -Your father's money won't save you next time. -Return him back to his hostel. -Yes, sir. -[coughs] Leave me. -Move forward. [Bassey] I said leave me. [groans] [in Hausa] Bassey! What's up? Are you all right? How are you? I told you... -they were going to catch us. -[laughs] [in Hausa] Well done. -Sorry. Sorry, bro. -[groans] [man] One, two, three, four! -One, two, three... -Sadiq, are you okay? I'm trying to die. You're asking me if I'm okay? -I'm trying to die here. -You won't die. Come on. Come on, Bassey, you can do it. Come on. [phone rings] Yo, Chris. How are you? [Chris] Hey, dude, you're all over the Internet. What are you talking about? I'm what? [man] One, two... [speaking Hausa] Wow. Wow! [in Pidgin] But wait, why are you sending her videos? [chuckles] [ringing] -Hi, baby. -You posted my videos? Yes, darling. -Tony posted the first one yesterday... -Wait! -...and it got such a response that I-- -"Tony" as in your ex-boyfriend Tony? Why does Tony have access to your phone? Hey! Otondo corper. Otuekong! Commandant office. Now. [exhales] Your request to be posted to Lagos. Sign at the bottom. [inhales] Thank you, sir. I've decided to remain in Bauchi. And what exactly do you mean by you aren't redeploying? I'm tired of Lagos. I-- I need some time away. Bassey, Chief isn't going to like this. Well, then maybe Chief shouldn't have sent me here. -I have to go. -[line clicks] [in Hausa] You know what? Honestly, I always suspected that Tony guy. Bastard! But, you know, girls like that are too fine for guys like us. [both laugh] -You know what? You're probably right. -[both laugh] -[both sigh] -[Hausa] This life. -Rich boy. -Hmm? Why don't you come teach with me? -Ugh! -Think about it. You really can't survive in Bauchi without me. -Okay, fine. Fair enough. Fair enough. -[chuckles] But why teaching? [clears throat] I'm sorry. -Is this about a girl? -[laughs] -[in Hausa] My friend has become a lover. -Come on! School teacher? [Sadiq] You teach two days, -then the remaining days you just... -Okay, now. -Hey. Bye-bye. -Hi. See you. The remaining days you just play, and then we'll go and look for my Zainab. -It's Zainab. That's why we are going. -Yeah. [laughs] Phew! I know you can drag me into the car, and I know it's just a job to you, but please, please don't do it. Please. [in Hausa] Hey, Bassey, relax. I tell you, he's not going anywhere. You cannot take him anywhere. Sadiq, look at his face. It's not the time. It's not the time. [in Hausa] I mean, all we're just saying is that... just don't carry him anywhere, just leave him. -It's just one year. One year. -Please. [dials phone] Hello, Chief. It seems your son has already left for his place of primary assignment. Yes, sir. I'll find out where. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. God bless you. Thank you. Go, go, go, go, go. [upbeat music playing] [music fades] [Bassey] Here we are. [Sadiq in Hausa] Thank you, my friend. Seriously... -Look. -See? Plenty of space. Different types of activities. This is going to be great. This is the new home, huh? -[in Hausa] Let's go. -Okay. Bassey, hurry up. [grunts, groans] My leg. -What happened? -My leg. -[in English] My leg. -Sorry. -[groans] Help me up. -Sorry. Come. -[groans] -All right. -[groans] -All right. Sorry. -[in Hausa] Ouch! -Sorry. Are you okay? What is this? [in English] What is this thing doing here? -It's covering the hole. -No, no, no. -Somebody can get seriously injured here. -Okay. Sorry. Let's go. -[frustrated sigh] -Come on. -We're going somewhere over there. -Let me carry this one for you. Bassey, help me carry my bags. -Sadiq, your-- your bag? -My leg. Okay. When your leg doesn't hurt anymore, you'll come get this one. No problem. Let's go. No, leave it. You come back. -[in Hausa] I'm hurt. -You will be all right. -I'm your only friend here in Bauchi. -You'll be all right. -I have one leg now, thank you. -You'll be all right! I hope they rob you. [sighs] I'm very surprised that NYSC will send you here. We are fully over-staffed. [sighs] In fact, we have not had a need for any youth corpers for a very long time now. Especially male corpers. Maybe they figured you might need us, and we can be quite useful. Yes, ma'am, very useful. I studied engineering at MIT in the United States. -Of America? -Yes, ma. -Oh! -And Sadiq here studied... Food science. Food science. Eh, I am not very sure that, uh, we will need any food scientist here. Uh... But I'm sure that some of my students will benefit from your further maths. Oh! Well, I would be happy to teach them, ma. But, you know, I'm not from here, and having a native like Sadiq would help me acclimatize and help me do my job better. [sighs] Okay. You are welcome to Kafin Madaki State Secondary School. -Thank you very much. Thank you, ma. -[laughs] It's okay. You can take your luggage to the corpers' lodge. -Okay. -No, don't worry, they will show you, eh? And if you feel up to it later, you can join us at the Emir's palace for the festival. [rap song plays] [no audible dialogue] [no audible dialogue] [no audible dialogue] [no audible dialogue] [neighing] [music continues] [no audible dialogue] [no audible dialogue] [Bassey] That was very nice. Thank you. I mean-- [in Hausa] Thank you. [in Hausa] Hey, you! What is wrong with you? Are you okay? I'm sorry. I don't understand. Who told you you can take pictures? My man, I don't understand what you're saying. What's the issue? This is unacceptable! I will have you beaten! Hey, listen. I don't understand what you're saying, but you need to get your finger out of my face. Don't point fingers at me. You need to get your finger out of my face. Come and see this man taking pictures during prayers. -Does anyone here speak English? -[continues shouting] Ah, Maryam, please go and help him. -The gentleman. Please. -Who is he? Uh, he is the new youth corper that was sent to us. His name is Mr. Bassey. Don't worry. I will go and see the officials myself. [men shouting] -Anybody here speak English? -[all shouting in Hausa] Hey! You need to get your fingers out of my face. [in Hausa] Sorry, I apologize. -[in English] What's going on? -I don't know. He started yelling at me. -What did you do? -I do not know. They keep yelling at me. [in Hausa] What is happening? He took pictures during prayers. Okay, I will talk to him. [in English] They said you took a picture of people praying. I did wha-- Come on. There's barely anything there. I was taking the structure. [in Hausa] Please, I'm sorry. He is new to this town. He's a stranger? Please tell him to delete the pictures he took. That is all we ask. Okay, I will speak to him. [in English] He said you should delete the pictures. I should... [chuckles] No! This is so unnecessary. What's unnecessary is the way he's yelling at me. [in Hausa] Look at him, I will slap him! You need to stop pointing at me. That's what you need to do. Sorry. He will delete the pictures now. Who are you? You do not want to listen to us! Same to you! -Warn him, we will deal with him. -All of you, go! -I swear, we will deal with him. -Sorry, I apologize. [mocking] Ya kuri! Ya kuri! [mutters] [deep sigh] -Mr. Bassey. -Yes, ma'am. You will visit the SS1 class today. -Okay. -The maths class. You will be asking them for their interest in Further Maths. -Okay. -Uh, this is the syllabus. Thank you. -Uh, Sadiq. -Yes, ma. For now, you will understudy Mr. Bassey in his class. Are you not comfortable? -We're very comfortable. Thank you. -Yes, ma. So, most of you failed the assignment. Is it that you didn't understand the topic, or... Yes? How can I help you? Uh, I'm the new Further Maths teacher. The principal sent me. What did she send you to do? To find out if anybody wants to sign up for Further Maths class. [Maryam] Oh! Um, hi, ladies. Is anybody interested in taking the Further Maths class? Show of hands, please. Further Maths class? No? Looks like no one is interested. Thank you. Yes. As I was saying... Well, Mr. Bassey... if no one is interested in taking Further Maths, I will have no justification to keep you here. This is so unfair. We're late. I know, but at least we're going to the local government. We cannot. It's already full. And that's not why they sent us here. -And now, they're going to send us to-- -[screams] -[groaning] -[gasps] See? This is what I was talking about. This thing is going to cause somebody serious harm. -[crying] -Sorry, sorry, sorry. Careful, please. [siren wailing] It looks like I will be needing a new PE instructor. Yes. We'll be very happy to, ma. We'll be very happy. -Yes, ma. We'd be very happy to. -[relieved sigh] Okay. Okay. In that case, you will be needing a female teacher to chaperone. [exhales] I think I know the right person. You want me to do what? Okay, ladies. Anybody want to sign up for PE? [murmuring] Physical education. We're putting together a running team. Can you help me, please? You're supposed to help me. [in Hausa] Quiet. That's all right. -All right. -Is there anyone who wants to take part in running and PE? [in English] Write your name here if you're interested. [relieved sigh] Yeah. [Bassey] It's gonna be a fun class. Extra-curricular activities. Okay. Halima, please step forward. [bickering] Hey, easy, easy. Take it easy. Help me. [in Hausa] What is it? All of you get back to your seat. [Bassey] What... Why did they do that? Why are they fighting? -They are all called Halima. -They're all-- -[school bell rings] -Oh! They're all called Halima. Uh, okay, thank you to everybody that signed up. We will get together tomorrow to start our first day of training. Physical fitness is going to be fun! All right. Thank you. Listen, I don't know how I would've done that without you. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Ms. Maryam, why are you so hostile towards me? What have I done to you that is so wrong? What's your deal? I have no deal. I'm just playing the part of the mean woman from Bauchi in your next video posts. -Wait, you've seen my videos? -[scoffs] I've seen all of your videos. I know who you are. Don't pretend you care about my students, because you don't. -But I-- -I can see through you. And I can't wait for the same breeze that blew you here to blow you back to where you belong to, because you're nothing but a selfish opportunist. [indistinct chatter] [panting] [in Hausa] Come, it's our teacher. [girls] Hi! I'm here in Bauchi with the girls. Aisha! [in Hausa] Come here. Go home. What kind of silly girl are you? Why are you so stubborn? How many times will I tell you that running is not good for you? But, Father, this is what I want. Will you keep quiet? You are not everybody. You are my daughter. -[crying] -For that reason, you should not run. [crying] Stop crying. Be quiet, Aisha. It is okay. You are the one making me shout at you. Do you want to kill yourself? Don't put this family to shame. Okay? Go inside and get something to eat. [Bassey] It was amazing. Having the girls running side-by-side with me on the street was truly inspiring. Well, that's it for now. Reporting live all the way from up north, it's your boy Bassey from Bauchi, with love. [kisses] Peace. [phone beeps] -Are you done? -Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's go. -[Sadiq] "It's your boy Bassey." -[both laugh] -Leave me. -[both laugh] [percussion] [romantic song plays] Ah, okay, Zainab's here. You should go over. I can't. That's not how we do things here. -Why not? -Because this is a social gathering. -So? -[scoffs] Besides, she's with the Grand Khadi. And who is a Grand Khadi? A Grand Khadi is a religious leader. And also in this case... [in Hausa] That's Zainab's father. -That's what? -[in English] Zainab's father. -Well, he's going over. -[clicks tongue] -Who's that? -Mallam Shehu. He's the richest trader in town. I'm guessing he's your competition, too. Okay. Well, I'm going over, so you can come if you want. [in Hausa] Wait. Bassey! Bassey! [in English] Excuse me, bro. Good evening, sir. Good evening, young man. [in Hausa] Good evening. Sir, my name is Bassey Otuekong, and I'm a corper at the state school. I am new in Bauchi and I'm, kind of, documenting my experiences. I was hoping I could come talk to you some time for some insight. [Grand Khadi] I will be happy to share with you. [Bassey] Thank you very much. Too many of our southern brothers and sisters don't know about us or our way of life. So if talking to the boy from Bauchi will help bridge the gap, I'm happy. -Oh, thank you very much, sir. -Yeah. This is my friend Sadiq. He's serving with me as well. [in Hausa] Greetings, Grand Khadi. [Grand Khadi] It's good to see you again, Sadiq. I am glad you pursued your education, unlike some people. -[chuckles] -Look, continue on that path. And I am likely to look favorably into your suit for my daughter. -[both] Thank you, sir. -Thank you. Hey, he said he would look favorably upon my suit. Did you hear that? -Yes, I was there. -[both laugh] -[loud sigh] -What did he mean by "path"? -[in Pidgin] Oh! I'm a graduate now. -Uh-huh. So I will go and work for the Ministry of Agriculture. -Okay. -And after that, I'll become Perm Sec. -Okay. Amen. I like it. -[chuckles] [phone chiming] -What's that noise? -Oh! It's my notifications. My last post went viral. [both cheer] -Man from Bauchi, indeed. -[both laugh] Do you know that the Grand Khadi knows you? I know. I almost died. -Ha! -[both laugh] -[school bell rings] -See you at the next class. -[girl] Bye. -Bye. -Bye. -Thank you. -Hi, Ms. Maryam. -Hello. If you have a minute, I'd like to run something by you. Sure. Here it is. It's a competition set up by the state government to encourage female participation in sports. -You want our students to compete? -Yes. And I want you to help me ask the principal. Please. They will really enjoy the competition and will get to travel around Bauchi. I think it's a nice idea. I agree. -It is a very good idea. -[relieved sigh] You have my permission. -Thank you. -Yes! Thank you. [whistle blows] All right. All right. Nice work, ladies. Nice work. Now listen up. So, in a relay, the fastest runner usually runs fourth, and today Halima was our fastest, so she'll be running fourth. I mean... I mean, Halima Hassan. What-- Okay. Sorry. You are Halima 1, you are Halima 2, you are Halima 3. Halima 1 was the fastest, so you'll be running fourth. -All right. -[in Hausa] Corper Bassey, -she's not even the fastest runner here. -Uh-huh. It's true. Everyone knows who the fastest runner here is. -Right. -But she did quite well. Who else can beat her? Ms. Maryam, nobody. I am the fastest. Don't listen to them. [in English] Okay. English, please. What's going on? They say Halima is not the fastest. So who is? Oh. Aisha, how you doing? So everybody says that you're the fastest in the school. Do you want to show me? No, I didn't mean now. I didn't mean like-like this. [frustrated sigh] Okay, let's do it again, all right? Back to position one. We'll do another trial. [panting] [gas hisses] [relaxed breathing] Okay, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for the love and support. We really appreciate it. It's our first meet this weekend and we're so excited. So please wish us luck. Signing out, broadcasting live all the way from up north in Bauchi. [in Hausa] It's your boy, Bassey. [in English] That means, "It's your boy, Bassey." Let's go. Please, get me Idara. Do you know about this? Oh. Oh. So you knew your brother was parading himself on social media like a clown. [chuckles] Well, I wouldn't exactly call it "parading." I... I thought maybe you'd take it as a good sign. That he's growing up. He is defying me. Okay. Let me-- Let me talk to him. It'd be better than dragging him back. Are you guys ready? -Bassey? -Hmm. What schools are these ones? Uh, that's FGC Bauchi and that is Immaculate Heart. [in Hausa] Hey. [English] Are we sure these people are the right age? Yeah. I mean-- That one on that side looks like she's already 20 years old. -The other looks like she's paying rent. -Sadiq. [both laugh] We'll be fine. Stop it. Don't listen to Mr. Sadiq. Just focus. No fear. No weakness. -Bass? Bass? -Just strength. -You're scaring the girls. Shut up. -They should be scared. -[whistle blows] -[girls cheering] [whooping] -[whistle blows] -[cheering] -[whistle blows] -[cheering] Hello, Aisha. Good afternoon, Mrs. Ahmed. Do you wish you were out there? No, ma. I'm happy not running. [sighs] What's wrong? You can tell me, hmm? Good race, coach. Thank you. Come on. Hey, what's wrong? Why is everybody looking so down? It wasn't so bad. You did great. Really. No, we didn't. We lost. Haba. Girls, he's right. And, just for that, we're all going for masa at Zainab's place. -[girls cheering] -Yeah! [Bassey] I saw you talking to Aisha earlier. Poor girl. She has asthma. That's why she can't run. Is that it? We can fix that. In the States, the second-best runner in my school-- Well, that's because I was the best. But no, seriously, the second-best runner in my school was asthmatic, and we just ensured he had everything he needed to run. It's possible. That was America. We don't have those sort of amenities here. Let me work on it. She shouldn't be deprived of chasing her dreams. -That would be great. [laughs] -I know. -[groans] Oh. Oh. Sorry. -What's wrong? [Maryam] My feet are killing me. I definitely do not have the shoes required to be a PE teacher. -[inaudible] -[Bassey] Sorry. Thank you. What are you doing? I want my fans to meet you. Trust me. It's painless. -Can I? -Okay. [phone chimes] So tell us about yourself. My name is Mrs. Maryam Ahmed, and I'm a maths teacher here at Kafin Madaki State Secondary School, Bauchi. And how long have you been doing this for? Just over a year. I was an associate professor at the University of Lagos before that. Really? And you quit that to move to Bauchi? I don't want to talk about that. Please stop recording. -[phone chimes] -I'm sorry. Wait. Did I say something wrong? No. No, not you. I have to go. Hey, Bassey. Wh-- What? You want me to what? [sighs] Okay. I'll-- I'll see what I can do. But you need to come home. Chief says that he's... [sighs] -[in Hausa] Well done. -All right. [no audible dialogue] There we go. Needs to sign this consent letter, okay? So that we can go to the competition. -High-five. High-five. All right. -[laughs] Surprise for you, too. Take it. -[in Hausa] You must make sure she eats. -Yes. Safe journey. Don't allow her to go anywhere. -Safe journey. -Thank you. Aisha, what's going on? -[whistle blows] -[cheering] [whooping] [indistinct chatter] I must be honest. I've never seen the girls this happy. Sorry. Was that a compliment? My network was down. Please, were you talking to me? -Of course I'm talking to you. -[laughs] Okay. Yes, I may have misjudged you. -Hmm. -But a little. I mean, I met you when you were fighting. Uh-uh-uh, I was being fought with. There is a difference. All the same... [indistinct chatter, laughter] [in Hausa] Halima. Halima. Stand up, let's go. I will deal with you. -Hey, wait. -No, no, no. [in Hausa] I will deal with you. Okay, let's go. I will deal with you. I will deal with you. What's the problem? She's upset Halima is spending time eating masa instead of coming home. [all clamoring] We will sort it out. You see? You see, Mr. Bassey? The parents are here to complain about their girls on the team. They feel that their daughters should be concentrating on their studies. Oh, come on, that's ridiculous! Ma, they are concentrated on their studies. They are. Yes, in fact, they are very engaged. -They are the happiest I've ever seen. -Exactly. That is not enough. And I think that the only solution here is for me to just suspend all track and field activities indefinitely. [clamoring] This is rubbish! Absolute rubbish! Well, this is how you handle disappointment? Maryam, we're one win, one win from entering the She Runs Bauchi finals. One! Oh, Bassey, this is not about us. Look at it from their perspective. Education is paramount and we cannot let anyone ruin it. Please. [principal] You want to cancel PE? Only for the girls on the team. They'll use PE for extra study. We'll get them a bus. It'll save them the walk home. -They'll get home at the very same time. -Yes. [sighs] What about the girls themselves? How do they feel about the extra work? They're willing to make the sacrifice, ma. [Bassey] Yeah. Okay. In that case, I will suggest that I will take it to the parents. -Okay. -Hmm? Thank you. [no audible dialogue] Hey, guys. So we're back. The parents approved and the next meet is in two weeks. It's a five-school meet, but if we place, we go to the She Runs Bauchi finals. So please wish us luck, okay? Peace and love. I'm Bassey, all the way from up north. Let's go. -[whistle blows] -[cheering] Give me a high-five! High-five! [car door opens] Hey, little bro. [sighs] Mmm. What are you doing here, Idara? Yeah. Chief is coming tomorrow. So I thought I'd come and give you the heads-up as well as some moral support. Oh, and I also brought some goodies for your girls. Like everyone else in Lagos, I've been following avidly. So... Aren't you going to introduce me to your friend? Why is Chief coming? He didn't say, but I'm sure it'll be fine. [sighs] What do you guys do for fun around here? [laughter] [Idara] No, he didn't. What happened next was even worse. They caught this man sleeping. -That was his fault, too. Okay. -Haba! -Hi. -Hi. -Maryam? -Hmm? [sighs] Look... nothing can come of this. Hmm? You're nice. I like you. But Bassey's not the man for you... not in the way that you both want. -But I can't make him choose-- -Yes, you can. You made a man out of him, but... but now you have to let him go. Maryam-- [Bassey] Maryam? Maryam, wait. Maryam, please. -What did she say to you? -[crying] Bassey, nothing I don't already know. You're going back to your mansion at the end of service. And... And what did you think would happen? [crying] I don't know. I guess I just... I... Maryam, I'm sorry. Why? Why, Bassey? You don't control how I feel. [engine starts] [car departs] Idara, what did you say to her? You had no right. I had every right. She's a widow. I'm happy that being here has made you more of a man, but you have responsibilities. Responsibilities that you are better suited for. As that's not an option, I'm here to make sure that you come home and you run it. -I'll see you at the lodge. -Bassey! Bassey, you can't keep running away from your problems. You've worked so hard with Ms. Maryam and all your other teachers to keep your grades up. -You've worked with Mr. Sadiq as well. -[laughter] Seriously, I need everybody to be focused, because this next month is our most difficult challenge yet. We have the She Runs Bauchi finals. [siren blaring] -You are welcome, sir. [chuckling] -Thank you. How are you? -How was your trip, sir? -It was beautiful. -Oh, thank you. -It's good to see you. -I'm the principal of the school. -Great! So great. -Thank you. Oh, here comes Bassey. -Oh! [chuckles] Bassey. [chuckles] So good to see you. [chuckles] -Kafin Madaki golden girls... -[girls] Forward ever! -Kafin Madaki golden girls... -Forward ever! All right. Let us clap for our visitor. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. My son, Bassey, has opened my eyes to this school and to these amazing girls. [applause] It is my pleasure to announce that Odeon Construction, with the permission of the state government, -will adopt this school... -[applause] [principal] Thank you! ...and ensure that the children here not only have what they desire to be successful, but we will also give a university scholarship -to every child who can go. -[cheering] Thank you. Thank you very much. -Excuse me. Sorry. May I? -Oh, yes, yes. Thank you. I think they're having fun. Why are you doing this? What do you want? Walk with me. Bassey, I am pleased with your achievements. I was initially unhappy with you parading yourself on social media like a fool, until I discovered the humanitarian angle. And then you came here to show that anything I can do, you can do better, right? Come on, boy, don't be resentful. This is the way of the world. -Right. -I'm proud of you. You have clearly shown finally that you are a man worthy of your name. There you are. What's this? Your reposting papers. You will serve with Otunba Adetola of Lotus. He wants to get to know you better, given that you will be marrying his daughter next year. And if I refuse? Odeon Construction will suffer unanticipated capital needs and will not be able to fund the scholarships. You would do that to these girls? The question is... will you? [in Hausa] Hey, rich boy. We've been looking for you. What's going on? [in English] Give us a moment, please. Please. -Do you want to talk about it? -Oh, now you want to talk to me? [sighs] Oh, Bassey, please. Please tell me what's wrong. My redeployment papers. Your father? The scholarships, the party, the gifts, it's all just a part of his plan. And if I don't go back with him... it's all gone. Bassey, you don't have to-- Look, Halima 2 is a genius, but her mom is a tailor. How's she going to go to university without that scholarship? You don't have to fix the problems of the world. Is that why you are hiding in this small town instead of being out there making a difference? [sighs] Oh, do you know, you're right. I chose this place. I chose to come up here. Because in the University, many people can make a difference. But in here, I'm one of the few who can. And that's exactly why I have to go. [inhales] When do you leave? Two days. Well, you know, there are still some parts of Bauchi that you haven't seen. [exhales] Unfortunately, I have to go back to Lagos. Um... This experience has been the best of my life. I'm really gonna miss you. [no audible dialogue] [no audible dialogue] [no audible dialogue] But Odeon cannot accept your valuation simply because of our 35% industrial market share. -We are a publicly quoted company. -And... [Chief] Bassey. Bassey. What are your thoughts? Uh... If we listen to the advisers, there'll be no deal. Or if there is, we would have spent so much time arguing back and forth about who brings what value to the table that it won't be worth it. This is supposed to be a partnership. My suggestion is 50-50. Even if somebody feels shortchanged today, the benefits tomorrow will greatly outweigh that. [Adetola chuckles] -The boy speaks sense. -Truly. Let's just do a JV. A 50-50 and, you know, we can dot all the I's and cross all the T's. Exactly. So, gentlemen and ladies, I want to thank you for being part of this... august occasion. -I appreciate all. -Chief, congratulations. To you, too. -We did it. -Finally. [laughing] Now, if it's not going to be any trouble, Lara and I want to come by the house this evening for dinner. -That won't be any problem at all. Yes. -[laughs] Thank you. -[Chief] Yes. Please, after you. -[Adetola] Okay. You know, why don't we just strengthen the public... [whistle blows] Have you seen Aisha today? -She wasn't in school today either. -[groans] Hey, girls. This lap was really slow. If you don't pick up the pace, how are you going to do well at the finals? [Aisha's father] Where is he? Where is he? Eh? Where is he? Where the teacher who's making my daughter... [stammers] ...make her run after I told her not to? [in Hausa] Sir, sir. [in English] But running is not a taboo for girls. How can them participating in sport be disrespectful to their parents? [stammers] How dare you tell me how to raise my child! I-- Let me tell you, I will do something about it. [in Hausa] This is nonsense! Sadiq, what did you say to Mallam Usman? [in Hausa] I didn't say anything. [in English] He did most of the talking. In fact, he did most of the shouting. [sighs] Well, you know that he is very protective of Aisha. She's the only child from his first wife. Unfortunately, he got the cooperation from other parents, and now they are insisting that all the activities of the running girls must be stopped. -What? -He can't do that. -Is there nothing we can do? -[sighs] Honestly, Maryam, I really wish that there's something that we can do. Mmm. Nice. -[laughs] -Thank you. -Hmm. -[laughter] -Bassey, darling. -Hmm? It is very commendable what you did with the girls up north. -Thank you, ma. -Oh, yes, commendable. -Yes. -Right. You see, I am focused on what he's going to do in the south. Absolutely. You see, this young man has a bright future ahead of him. -Yeah. -[chuckles] Ahead of them. -Ah, ahead of them. -Ahead of them. [laughter] -[glass clinking] -[Chief] Ah, yes. Hear. Hear. So let us toast to this remarkable union. -[Chief] Ah, yes, yes. Let us. -Yes. Yes. [clears throat] My dear... -[glasses clinking] -Cheers. -Cheers. -[chuckles] My dear. -Bassey! -Oh! -[toasting] -My children. Yes! [phone rings] [exhales] Well, that went well. You managed not to-- -What are you doing? -I have to go back to Bauchi. What are you talking about? The girls' team was suspended, okay? -That's not your problem, Bassey. -Listen, just tell the parents I'll be back as soon as I sort this out. I promise. No! Bassey, no! You don't get to put the girls before your family. -We need this merger. -Okay, fine. We solve the merger problem and then I'm gone. Deal? How are you going to solve the mer-- -Deal. -Okay. I don't understand. Okay, sir. What I'm trying to say is, -I don't want to marry Lara. -Huh? And I'm sure she doesn't want to marry me either. This marriage is just because you need the merger to be successful. However, there is another way. Idara. Talk to her. If, at the end of it, you still feel like I need to marry your daughter, then we can have that conversation. [exhales] It was nice talking to you, Otunba. Uh, what-- The-- [hip-hop playing] [no audible dialogue] [goat bleating] [no audible dialogue] [goat bleating] -[in Hausa] Hey, rich boy! -My friend! -[in English] Hey, you're back. -Yep. -[sighs] Bassey! -Maryam. You shouldn't have come. I had to. [door opens] Ah! I never thought I'll see you again, Corper Bassey. Ma, there has to be something that we can do. These girls have to run. It's not fair. [sighs] It is a religious matter now, Mr. Bassey. And I have to bow to the will of the parents. However, should the religious rulings change, maybe then we can talk. So, what are we going to do? Huh! We do what the principal said. What did the principal say? [scoffs] She suggested we get a religious ruling on the matter. So... And how do we do that? Simple. We talk to Sadiq's future father-in-law. [in Hausa] Why? Why? -Greetings. -Greetings. -Greetings. -Greetings. Please sit down. Thank you, sir. So, how may I help you, gentlemen? Sir, have you heard about the religious ban on running at the state school? Religious ban? Which religion will ban girls from running? Certainly not Islam. That's why we're here, sir. We'd like you to hear the case at Sharia court and make a ruling in the girls' favor. You want me to rule on a case without hearing both sides? -Sir, but you just said-- -Of course not, Grand Khadi. We just feel that given the merits of the case, it is highly likely what your decision would be. -[Grand Khadi] Mallam Usman. -[no audible dialogue] Your daughter's talent is a gift from Allah, which should be nurtured. You should be proud. Proud? Sir, my wife died of asthma. My daughter is having asthma. [in Hausa] In fact, running will increase the danger to her health. Mallam Usman, Aisha's asthma should not stop her. Besides, the team has ensured that she will not be in danger. Please, Mallam Usman. Don't stop Aisha from achieving her dreams. I will accept the decision of the Sharia court. And your daughter? Will she be guided by the ruling of the court? She will be guided by her father, sir. But everything will be okay. Just be positive. One second. -Bassey. Bassey. -Mallam Usman? -Greetings. -Greetings. Greetings. Sir, I'm truly sorry about what happened at the festival. I didn't mean to disrespect you or your religion. But, sir, your daughter is very special. She has the potential to represent Nigeria if she's nurtured. I just pray that if the court rules in our favor today, that you find it in your heart to allow her achieve her vision. Please, sir. Please. [in Hausa] This is absolute nonsense. Nonsense! Nice speech, but I don't think he bought it. [mutters] [sighs] [in Hausa] Sit down and eat. No. So, did we win? Did we? -You can't hold it for one minute? -[joyful screaming] [laughter] Oh, my God, I can't believe it! Yes! Oh! Okay, but now we have to get written consent from all the parents. -We're going to win She Runs Bauchi! -[cheering] [Maryam] Where is Sadiq? [Bassey] Zainab asked him to go watch the games with her. -Wow! -I know. -That's a good sign. -Yes, it is. [Maryam laughs] [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, you're welcome to Abubakar Tafawa Balewa stadium, Bauchi, for the She Runs Bauchi competition, bringing girls from all over the state, to compete with others, including the famous girls from Kafin Madaki. All over Bauchi, listeners are tuning in to listen, while people watch the event. The girls from Kafin Madaki will be among the favorites, but their star athlete is not with them. [static buzzing] [national anthem plays] -[reciting scriptures] -Listen. Let her follow her dreams. -[national anthem continues] -[students singing] [singing national anthem] [cheering] [announcer] To underscore the importance of this competition, the Governor, His Excellency Mohammed Abubakar, is here to flag off the event. As the saying goes, "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy." And what we are trying to encourage you to achieve is to have a sound mind in a sound body. For that reason, it is my greatest honor and privilege to declare the finals of this competition open. -Thank you and God bless you. -[cheering, applause] [announcer] Oh, the moment is here. The moment is here. It's the moment of truth. The first race is the 100 meters. It is the first time for half of the girls. Halima of Kafin Madaki is behind the runner of FGC Bauchi, who wins the race. Not the kind of race we're expecting from Kafin Madaki. But they manage a second place. [no audible dialogue] Starting next is the 200 meters, and Kafin Madaki is not doing well. Can they manage to do it in the 400 meters? Oh, yes! They run! It is Halima Hassan from Kafin Madaki. She is leading the pack by a huge gap. And she is in the race! She is in the race! What a race! What a race! She puts Kafin Madaki in the third place. She puts Kafin Madaki in the third place. Ah! Kafin Madaki just won again. FGC is still first, but Kafin Madaki moves to second place, with the chance to go first place if they can win the next race. If they can win the next race. It is close. It is close. But Immaculate girls win and Kafin Madaki drop to fourth place. It's all about the points. It's all about the points. FGC Bauchi is leading the points. It is very close. But the girls from Kafin Madaki are running out of time. Only one race left. Only one race. [indistinct chatter] [cheering] Okay, now, ladies, listen up. Some of these other teams have more talent than we do, but that's okay, you know why? Because hard work beats talent every time talent doesn't work hard. And you guys are the hardest workers on this field. -So we're going to win this title today. -Yes. All we need to do is win this last 4x100 race. Are you with me? -Yes, sir. -Good. [Halima] We are going to do our best, Corper Bassey. It's just that relay has always been Aisha's-- Was Aisha's what? [all screaming] [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, what am I seeing? [cheering] The excitement! The excitement! The excitement! It is unbelievable. Unbelievable! Now we are ready. I repeat, now we are ready. We are ready for the final race. Any of the four schools... I mean, any of the four schools can win it. Any of the four schools can win it, including the girls from Kafin Madaki, if they come first. Halima Hassan leads. [indistinct] Kafin Madaki drops to third place. What can Aisha do? She receives the baton and she takes off. Off she goes. She's ahead. She's ahead. She's ahead of the pack by a big margin already! By a big margin! But can she hold on for the win? Can she hold on for the win? The FGC team is closing down. She's closing down. Closer, and closer, and closer! Aisha is winning! [announcer continues, indistinct] [crowd cheering] [all cheering] [announcer] They win the race. They win the race. [all cheering] Kafin Madaki wins the race. Kafin Madaki comes back from behind to win the competition. Kafin Madaki! What a girl. What a girl. [announcer continues indistinctly] Ladies and gentlemen, this is Amin... from BBC, signing off. [chanting] Kafin Madaki, Kafin Madaki! And finally, Aisha Usman! [cheering] [laughs] [inaudible] [shutter clicks] Be good, okay? Bye. It's so hard saying goodbye to these girls. Just the girls? [sighs] Go well, Bassey. Haba, bro, you're just going to let her go like that? [sentimental song plays] [man singing in foreign language] [music fades] The prodigal son returns. I'm sorry, but I had to go. You had to go? The future of the company was at stake... and you left to save schoolgirls? Yes, I did. I was the only one who could solve their problem. But I knew that I could leave because Idara was here. You have your heir. So, what are you going to do now? Go back to your girls in Bauchi? No. No. We made a deal. You helped my girls. Now I work for you. The marriage is off. I don't need you anymore. And my girls? Do you still need them? Did you ever think I was gonna take out your bad behavior on young, defenseless girls? I established a school endowment as soon as I returned from Bauchi. Thank you. No. Don't thank me. Bauchi has made a man out of you, which is more than I did. However, if you choose to go back there... you leave with nothing. [scoffs] Nothing's changed. You're still trying to use your money to control me. Not at all. Disobeying me has consequences. You choose whether you are willing to live with them. I hope you choose wisely. [traditional music] [singing in foreign language] I think, if we're able to do that... we'll have been of service to ourselves. -I think we've covered everything, right? -[both] Yes. Yes. -You are welcome to the BBC. -Thank you very much, sir. -Congratulations. -Thank you, sir. I'm so grateful. [music continues] [man singing] What's the matter? I'm just wondering... will this be enough for you? -You're enough for me. -[scoffs] I'm serious. I'm serious, too. I should be the one who's worried. I mean, is a video reporter for the BBC enough for you? -[sighs] -[man continues singing]
