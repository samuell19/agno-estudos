I was like, I'm not trying to smoke a blunt I'm trying to snort something. When I was doing coke, ecstasy, "K", I was smoking meth. I was doing a lot of that But what was your use for doing it, for killing yourself? Mine was to overdose. There's no use for doing drugs ever! There's no use. But my use for drugs was for killing myself. I would overdose every day. Then you need therapy. If need therapy you can talk to me or a doctor. It's not therapy. Im so glad I'm done with this But triple C's is a drug that's Coricidin Coricidin on the purple box. If you take 8 or 16 pills you'd be like... It's like "K",ecstasy and acid all at once. It was so hard core... You see that? That's a reminder of how stupid I really am. I got a track mark, I never wanted to have one of these things. It's my laugh button and every time my Father would get pissed off or mad at me, I would go Brrrp and push it. (street ambience) You're telling me that you don't have a place to stay? You know what? We could be like vampires and we'll just keep our asses up all night and sleep all day at my cousin's house There's no parties that go after 4am. There's after hours After hours. We'll be fine.

Exactly. You don't like like someone who is disenchanted, or somebody who's lost. Because there's hope. Then as long as you have hope then it's all fine. When you have no hope you become a whore, then you're depressed. But if you're crying, you're upset and it means you're fine But if you keep hanging with this one, and that one, getting high He's going to kill all emotion you have left in in you. And you're not going to want to do nothing, and one day you'll say I used to draw and when I ask you, you'll be like ugh. And you're not going to care. if you're crying about it, keep crying. And you should be upset and light a fire under your feet And if you're bored about it and not moving forward, then stop! And be a freaking whore. My friend about 6 years ago... Told me to tattoo my face and I said, Why? And he said... put yourself on the corner where you can get a job doing anything. I can't even get a job flipping burgers!
