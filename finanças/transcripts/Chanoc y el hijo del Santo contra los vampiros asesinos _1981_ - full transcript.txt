My son, I have been preparing you to take over my place I have taught you to love the poor and the distressed and now you are ready to help and defend them, to fight for law and justice and most of all to be a friend to the people I will bestow upon you that mask which has been my emblem and pride When you don it, you will have to honour it always, even when your very existence is in danger If you feel you have the strength to dedicate your life to it swear it just as I did But first, you must know something: Once you put it on, you can never go back Now tell me, are you determined? Yes Father, I swear it Take it, with this I grant you all my power Chanoc and the Son of Santo vs The Killer Vampires I'm not taking a step out of this hotel until you tell me what we we're doing here in southern Baja California Alright, you can know now, we came to study the places the government has designated as ecological reservations Oh, by god's nose, teeth and beard, I thought we were going near the border, over there with the blondies that visit Tijuana and Ensenada Gotta say I love the ones from Ensenada Anyway, you're the boss, we go where you want but just don't say anything, not another word Look at those marvellous specimens, and to think there are people who commit wholesale massacres of these defenceless animals It's a good thing the Mexican government protects them and considers that a crime I'll be a monkey's uncle, now I know why we're here! To investigate who organizes those massacres That's right. The animals are killed to take their skins which are used to make luxurious women's coats To be honest Chanoc I like women without coats Actually, just forget the whole dress. If we hurry we can get to Acapulco- Now I'll teach you to fish The first thing you need to learn is how to cast the line Watch how I do it Oh mommy! Looks like you caught some butt sir You got a butt there What a shame, it got away, it got away You see? When you know how to cast the line you always catch something Yes, a bucket Look! What's going on there? Captain, to that boat please Alright, let's go Here it is Captain, stop the boat Relax, relax, we're aboard Oh mommy! Hey Santo, where did this lovely woman come from? Are they alive? Where are your manners? Let me go, I have to save my godfather He's next to you, looks like he's coming to He pulled us out of the water? It was none other than I I'm dead, I'm dead! The devil, the devil! Who shaved this devil? What do you mean shaved devil? I'm Carlitos, the devil's guardian, I mean Santo's, who taught him to defend himself against his enemies and pulled you, out of the ocean I'm Marcos, Carlitos' friend Who are you and why were you thrown into the sea? I am Chanoc and this grumpy old man is my godfather Tsekub I'm not old, I'm not old! The sea's old and it's still wet! We're here to defend Mexico's marine wildlife, principally the seals and the sea lions From what I see we're not well regarded by the poachers who would have killed us if it weren't for the assistance of you and the masked man By the way, where is he? I'd like to thank him Give them to Carlitos, he's the one who pulled you out of the sea I don't like being in trouble, I hate violence I'm here because my parents asked me to follow Carlitos on a trip around the world, no more than that We're grateful to Carlitos and the masked man, but we'd be even more grateful if you took us to a hotel, - we're totally bushed - Of course we'll take you, a man of your age would be exhausted after everything that's happened Look Methuselah, back on land two blondes are waiting for me, they're shaped just like this Bah, what would you know about it? What do I know? I know I want you to share Of course, I'm only Santo's representative, but I taught him to wrestle, I launched his career, I made him champion! And I'm Chanoc's godfather Though we're the same age I trained him and taught him everything he knows Oh, you're here Chanoc? Isn't that all true Chanoc? If you say it then it must be true godfather Won't you introduce me to your friends? Of course! They're Marcos and Chanoc Our delicious and delectable friends here are Dolores and Isabel She's my favourite Sit down boys, sit They told us what you're here for and we'd like to help though I'm only here to accompany my brother Jan and Isabel who works at the cabaret So you're the sister of Mr. Lopez, the one who came to buy precious stones, right? I think I know your friend Isabel too, I've heard her sing somewhere It's no easy thing to forget such a lovely girl Alright, alright, but we mustn't keep Chanoc and Tsekub waiting too long since they have to go and find their attackers Don't be selfish, don't be selfish! It's true, you'll have to excuse us Where are you going? We don't know the city and honestly I have no idea where to start Listen boys, why don't you go to the Cesar Bar? My brother goes there, he says everyone does That's a good suggestion. I think we'll be seeing each other again soon Let's go I'll leave my hat and glasses with you Don't get too burned - Bye Tsekub - You'll see Tsekub, sit down - I'd like a- - Two sodas please We're gonna rust Too bad, I guess I'll just have to deal with it Do you recognize any of the clients? I haven't even had the chance to settle in, how do you expect me to recognize someone? - Listen friend? - Yes? Maybe you can help us We want to buy some animal skins, you know what I mean We only sell fine drinks here, it was only by chance that I found those sodas and now it'd be best if you paid me and left Do you know those gorillas that just went by? - Are they from around here? - I don't know. It's 50 pesos, pay me What a grouch Let's go kid, there's nothing to be had here Let me go, let me go I'm gonna kill those thugs, you see what I did to them? I just got up and they ran like the devil was after them Let's help the masked man who's timely arrival saved our lives Geez, another masked man? He disappeared I had three of my enemies right in front of me, one of them pulled out a gun, the Killer, and then she said "Hold it! Stay there or I'll kill you" I stood as still as a statue But buddy, don't you trust me? Why didn't you call me, you know I'm as good in a fight as I am in a party You're always messing things up I think it's time to go see that cabaret Forgive us for leaving, but we already had plans to go with the boys to the cabaret We'll see you tomorrow at the pool Shall we? We woo them and they take them Don't worry Carlitos, we'll find us some blondes, some white women, some Americans, those don't cause a fuss You know, I hypnotize them with this Greek profile Sure Apollo - I'm not a boxer - Oh lord, he lacks culture! To be honest I think I like him better To be honest it's not the first time someone leaves me for him Carlitos isn't any different really Just what I needed, for you to run off with an old timer but I swear I'll leave him here to take care of Tsekub That's a very good idea Good evening, hello All of your brother's friends look like thieves They're not his friends, he just does business with them You aren't in very good company either, you always end up fighting with them Jan is a real gentleman This is my number, I'll dedicate it to you Shall we dance? - Would you permit me? - This is my song And I don't want Dolores' brother Jan to come and interrupt us, why don't I just take you for a ride in my car? I accept, but shouldn't we tell the others so they can come too? Let's go I'm inviting you for a ride in my car, shall we? Let's go Tell us the story of the famous vampires of Tijuana Well people say that many men have been found dead close to the graveyard and the strangest thing is that when they did the autopsies they discovered that they didn't have a drop of blood in them They also found two holes in their necks, like the fangs of a vampire, through which they think the blood was sucked out There are vampires in my country too They look like mice but they attack men They also like sucking the juice out of animals These aren't small, some people have seen them in flight and they say that they're much bigger than man Oh wow, how horrible Bi-i-bigger than a man? I wouldn't want to run into them! Don't be afraid Charlie, human type vampires don't exist here or in America, they live in Europe, in Transylvania That's what they said in Tijuana until all those guys turned up dead Let's talk about something else, dead things make my teeth chatter That must be skeletons Charlie, we're talking about vampires Yes, vampires You got me all wet Charlie Carlitos is right, we should keep drinking We need another drink, Tijuana is too far away to go get one there More milk, I'm turning into a sheep here Let's go before it gets any later He's right, I have to go Wait, I'll go with you Since you drank the milk you're going to have to pay for it, we're going to milk the money out of you Who am I going with? I wanna go with the woman from the other day Don't you fall down Tsekub This is one of the first missions created in Baja California and also one of the best preserved Now let's go see if we can hear something Tonight I have to be in Tijuana, you hear? You'll sell the merchandise tomorrow at 3 during the low tide and you'll bring the money to me in Tijuana, I'll be waiting - How's it going boys? - Hello Just looking at the mission? Yes sir, or to be more specific, admiring it just as we admire the men who built it Be sure to visit the church, it's very interesting - I'll be seeing you - So long I told you, that man is a prime suspect He might be the boss of the group that acts against the sea lions but I'll be there at low tide to expose him Will you come with me? You're not jealous, are you? How can you say that, you heard it too, right? If you're afraid I can just get Tsekub to come with me I'll go with you anyway, but first I have to ask for a favour You know I hate violence and Carlitos made me promise him that I'd join the Son of Santo in a tag team match tomorrow His partner got sick and- And you want me to go instead of you Alright, agreed I knew you would, and now let's go because the girls must be waiting for us by now Oh, by the way, don't say a word to Delores about your suspicions about her brother, alright? Alright We finished, now we can go for a ride Dolores and I had an idea - Oh? And what's that? - You have to have a job so no one knows what you're doing here A job? Like what? You'll sing with me in the cabaret After hearing you I'm sure you won't make us look bad Another job, today's second What did you say? I thought you'd be happy Of course I am This way I'll be able to spend more time with you, now let's go, they're waiting for us Let's go, we have to keep checking out social centres Th-th-thinking about more milk today makes me feel like what I drank last night is going come out of my ears That's because you're an idiot, um, I mean idiotically dedicated Well, off to work Help me Don't push me, calm down, easy Oh mother, I'm drowning, I'm drowning Let's go through here, follow me Did you bring the merchandise? There's the money - Let's go - Don't, they might kill you Let's follow them, we finally know where to find Jan It won't start, give me a hand It's useless, they took the distributor cap Let's try to catch up to Jan! Now they've foiled us Marcos, the match starts at 8 and we won't get there on time walking I think we both win then, you because you won't have to fight and me because I won't have to watch that violent spectacle We should start walking if we don't want to spend the night here Follow So you prefer to sleep in the car, right? Damned old man, I bet your godson got scared and he won't ever come Oh yeah Charlie, then what happened with your famous Son of Santo, haven't you noticed he hasn't come either? The Son of Santo has no fear, he's like his father, invincible And besides, that doesn't matter What do you mean it doesn't matter, do you think my cub is going to wrestle alone? What do you mean alone, what do you mean solo? Don't you remember that I taught both the father and the son? Sure, all that was left was the holy spirit, amen And besides, I have a mask, with that I'll replace him in the ring and I don't see who can fill in for Chanoc You think so? No, I'll be your partner and I'll protect you We'll see who's who in the ring Remember that I'm the ace of powerslams Oh yeah, well I'm the prince of beatdowns Hey Tsekub, are those patented? They're advertising - Look at that car - That's why you brought me The Son of Santo told me to give you this mask and these boots for you to wear Where is he? He's outside, but he wanted you to hurry because he's headed to the ring Alright buddy, I'll hurry I'll go find a good spot to watch the match Good luck Respected audience, your attention please These two poor devils are only pretending to be the Son of Santo and his partner Just a moment people, the real ones are on their way The Son of Santo and Blue Shadow Yes my friends, we've just received the news that the previous duo were not the Son of Santo and the Blue Shadow I grabbed my enemy's leg and gave it a bite worthy of a chainsaw That wasn't your enemy's leg! That was my leg when I was going after mine Oh, my poor leg Tsekub, has he come back? The Son of Santo wanted to say goodbye He just got dressed and left I want to see him too, if it wasn't for us they couldn't have beaten them - What? - We tired them out! Help me up I wish you hadn't helped me Kill him Hold it! Well, everyone says that vampires have all of Tijuana terrorized What happened kiddo? Where have you been cub, I looked for you all over the hotel Following this briefcase It's the same briefcase that Jan used to pay for the gems, where did you find it? The man who had to deliver it to Tijuana was carrying it. who died accidentally by the way, and it has the money Why don't you give it to the police? Do you need it for something? Of course I do, since I saw the gems my suspicions have been confirmed This isn't just about the sale of sea lion skins, there's something larger and more dangerous here, and besides, I've been able to perceive the sinister hand that guides all this, the hand of the Mafia - The Ma-ma-ma - You're always talking about your mother, the Mafia has none So what do you plan to do? he truth is we have to deliver this briefcase to its destination in Tijuana I can't do it because they know what I look like They know what I look like too Carlitos is the one for the job Sadly I can't do it either, my mission is to take care of Marcos, you see Marcos, I think you can help us deliver this briefcase which will take us to the head of the organization who I want to meet and destroy Though I dislike violence I'll do as you ask I'll take the briefcase While we wait here Watching and taking care of the girls You'll have to come with us to watch our backs and besides, I have a mission for you - We'll help you - Just leave it to us You'll have to go to the graveyard to investigate that vampire rumour I think that has a connection with our case Why don't you just turn that briefcase in? I'm not afraid of dead people, but we don't want anything to do with vampires, right Tsekub? You go, we stay, if you need help we'll give it to you - Call us at 1154 - Or at the hotel - Aren't you nervous? - No I know you'll be listening and it's my turn to dedicate a song to you I was expecting you would So now you know I like you a lot I knew that, that's why Dolores and I decided to help you even Jan has promised to once he comes back from Tijuana So Jan is in Tijuana I should have figured I'll probably see him there Thanks to your company I've had a marvellous time Me too, it's a shame my vacation is nearly over We'll be leaving as soon as Jan comes back Then this could be our last night together, let's enjoy it - Where's Chanoc? - He's over there. Chanoc! Coming Tonight you'll go to the graveyard to find the fabled vampires while Marcos and I will go to the nightspots to find Pete Look cub, why don't Carlitos and I go to the nightspots and you two go visit all those bones in their dirt beds, what do you say? Of course, we're used to those sorts of investigations and besides, I want to taste the milk in every bar in Tijuana We're not going to argue about it, we had agreed you'd go look for the dead They're really serious and don't talk much The dead, we just agreed to look for vampires! Oh mommy, I don't like this Now now, don't start with your mommy again Charlie We're brave and audacious, we'll stand up to the dead! ...and the vampires I want to stay here and look after Marcos, his parents asked me to There's no danger where I'm going Carlitos, but Tsekub might need a brave man's help He's supposed to help me against the vampires? No way, what you want is that we dig our own graves, that's what you want I did what I promised, I want you to leave me alone for good We'll see You're all useless, I'll have to go back to Loreto to fix things personally and I expect you to be there when I arrive I'll be there if you need me You better It's better if they don't see us together I'll follow Jan while you talk to Pete You first You first Youth goes first Why not age? Help me Give me your foot, give me your foot! It's easier on this side Lift your foot Give me your hand Tsekub, now up - I can't - Have to be in first gear Tsekub May I sit? I have something to tell you Alright, sit down and be quick, I'm in a hurry You're waiting for a friend, right? What do you know? I have the briefcase with the money You better give it to me immediately or you'll regret it Relax if you want to see it again Alright, what do you want for it? Nothing, your friend gave it to me and made me swear I'd only give it to one person Then give it to me No, not to you, to the boss You'll give it to me or face the consequences If something happens to me neither you nor your boss will receive it and he wouldn't like that, right? You win, but give me some proof that you have it The briefcase has 500 thousand big ones, our friend made me count them in his presence Very well, the boss in Loreto We'll see each other there in three days, agreed? I'll be there Oh Tsekub, the va-va-vampires! - Those are some big mice - We have to go hide Tsekub, this way This way, this way! There's the vampires, let's get out of here Tsekub, let's get out of here! Wait for me! Teskub, it's me, Carlitos, your Charlie Your bald head convinced me, give me your white hand Give me the keys St. Peter! I'm St. Charlie, and let's get out of here before the vampires see us Let's go Don't move or I'll kill you Miss, Miss, it's an emergency, get me the police Police, they've just kidnapped my friend Dolores So in three days we have to meet the boss in Loreto What a coincidence, Jan is heading to Loreto tomorrow, they told me at his hotel You think he's the leader or are you just jealous again? We'll see in Loreta, but before doing anything else- Mission accomplished cub, mission accomplished The vampires exist! They attacked us furiously at the graveyard If it wasn't for me Carlitos wouldn't have gotten out of there alive The truth is I got out of there more alive than dead because of the deceased The vampires didn't scare me and I kept them from sucking on Tsekub and leaving his bones drier than a popsicle stick Don't get carried away bowling ball head Calm down brush face Enough godfather, that's enough And now tell me, did you see the vampires? We saw the vampires flying, just as if they were in first class And they're bigger than anything! Where were they coming from? I don't know exactly, but I saw them with these two eyes that the worms nearly ate They didn't ask you that Charlie They're from the north, they're American vampires They're pale and bloodthirsty tourists I have to go find those vampires tomorrow night, will you come? Though you know I find violence repugnant, I'll go with you just to prove that vampires don't exist They do, they do! They're horrid, hairy, big headed and smelly They have hands like giant spiders and fangs that were as long as my fingers Good afternoon Sit, please Tell me, to what do I owe the honour You know what I'm here for It's been over 24 hours since my friend Dolores was kidnapped and you haven't been able to find her This isn't as easy as you think We've been investigating and haven't found a lead But if you don't find her soon they might kill her Believe me, we're doing everything possible but it's not easy We know the local people very well We're sure that this attack was carried out by a foreigner So what are you waiting for? You know there's a large population of drifters In Puerto Escondido alone there are 5000 Americans camping, and many more in the whole region, so it's hard knowing who did it and where they have her You haven't told me anything new Maybe she went with her brother and just hasn't turned up yet I told you those men took her in my presence while Jan was gone Perhaps he had her kidnapped Don't be silly, I know Jan well and I know he's not capable of doing that I'm sure he'll clear everything up when he gets back Alright, we'll wait for him to come back if he comes back You're all useless, you're good for nothing! Will they come tonight? Sure they'll come, luck is with us You're a coward buddy You let your cub go off alone to have his blood drained I'm no coward and my godson is no soft drink, you're a coward a coward for letting Marcos go get his blood sucked It's one thing to send him to the red cross, but you sent him to the mice, the big mice, they're real vampires! Maybe you're right, let's go help our boys who can't defend themselves! You're right buddy, we should beat those vampires up again and leave them for the kids Though I think it'd be a better idea to wait a little while more and then go scare them Oh Carlitos, that's brilliant, the greatest idea ever Come here, my little Carlito's, my shiny headed genius Why don't we toast on it Tsekub? Look, there they go They really look like vampires - Should we go after them? - Let's go We have them, we have them! We got here on time to knock these bloodsuckers out Tsekub, look what they have, I knew they were smugglers This is surely the way to get the gems across the border Well done boys, shame you didn't tell us everything you knew, it would have kept us from staying up late You have to do something, right? What's that buddy? If we don't teach them they'll never learn C'mon Charlie, let's have some fun, this looks like a good place Tsekub, there's the targets No, don't part it in the middle, they'll recognize you But just seeing them makes my hair stand on end You're head is as bald as an egg I don't have much hair, but what's there is fine You heard about Dolores, right? No, we just got here We only went to the hotel for a shower and then we came to the cabaret, what happened? Two days ago some men kidnapped her from our hotel room when we went back to sleep. She hasn't come back The police hasn't been able to find her And has Jan come back? Yes, he came back yesterday. He's been going crazy waiting for news at the hotel This is all very strange, but don't worry, Marcos came back with me and we'll fix this Alright, but you have to sing, you agreed to do it Sure, but don't worry, everything will be fine Don't forget to carry out the orders to the letter I'll wait for you at the hotel lobby tomorrow at 8 to take you to the boss I'll be there Is he me, or I am I him? He's better buffed than you are She looks like a cactus My briefcase! Give me my briefcase! Are you the boss? We have him, we'll make him confess! Let's go I'll wait here You can't do this to me, I'll report you to the police! Here you have the boss I told you all along, he's the boss I said it first Isabel, tell them to let me go, I have to get the briefcase with the money, only that way will they give me my sister back alive Please tell them to let me go Let him go! Let him go I say! You heard her, let him go Hold it, don't move from here until I get back unless you want to ruin things if you haven't already, and you wait here please It's better if you wait here with me I told you he was the boss I said it first Is that the money? Yes, but I told you I'd only give it to the boss He's waiting. Follow me Boss, this is the man who has the briefcase So you're the leader of the gang involved in the smuggling of skin and jewels Yes, give me the briefcase Give me some proof you're the boss The briefcase - Let's go - No one's leaving here Take care of him Grab me, don't let go! Look at your money, just trash Everything's over Remember, the Mafia never forgives Let's go Thank you Marcos Cut it out, you're making us nervous We have to leave immediately, they're holding her captive on the island and her guards have orders to kill her That's what the boss said? That's what he said Let's go, what are you waiting for? Wait, it's very dangerous that they see us arrive together The best thing would be if Marcos and I go alone and surprise them Let's go I want to go too Hold him until we come back Sit down, sit down It's better to do as they say, I'm sure everything will turn out fine What's wrong? I'm thirsty I'm tired, untie me please You know what our orders are Yes, but I don't think a man as strong as you are would be afraid of a weak woman Alright, I don't think you can get off the island anyway, but remember, you have to stay near me Agreed, now please untie me Why did you take so long? So we discovered the boss when we went to the graveyard And we also discovered where Dolores was Let's go boys Hurry, we're saying goodbye Now we've really been beaten buddy The End Translation: Turdis July 2009
