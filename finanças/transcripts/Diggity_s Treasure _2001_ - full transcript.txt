[dazzling music] [soft gentle music] [gentle majestic music] [girl] Harry! Get off the road! [woman] Morning, Emma. Morning, Rachel. How are you? I'm fine, thanks. Are you gonna check on preparations at the church, do you have time to-- I believe you have a letter for me. Say good morning boy! Good... And good morning to you too, Mr. Slee. Yes dear as soon as I've done my rounds. See you then. [soft gentle music] What's the point? You just don't get it, do you? She doesn't have a child. She's not even pregnant! Sorry... but when do I get my wish? Stitches, are you playing or not? Put that rat away! She's not a rat, Heidi's a guinea pig. [all] One, two, three. [ominous music] Yes! Oh Stitches won. Slee! Heidi. Stitches no, forget her. Watch out, Rupert. I don't think you're fast enough gypsy boy. Please don't hurt her. No! [tense music] Papa, it's Old Slee! Well, Mr. Slee have the children been in your garden again? No Roma, you give your brats in my garden too much credit. It's proper business I have. This letter is from my brother and solicitor, Snitley... He's found the air to this property. Someone actually owns it? IT appears that this land as well as the main building was part of a 500 year lease from some ancient benefactor. The lease has expired and this property has reverted to the air. May I inquire as to who the new owner is? It's not me Roma if that's your concern, but when he receives my proper offer a deed will be signed before you can say street urchin. It's going to be a long cold winter, Roma, wherever you and your little potato thieves find to live. Say good morning boy! [heart-wrenching music] [light inquisitive music] Heidi. [wind blowing] [guinea pig squeaks] [thudding sound] [tense music] Well, well we meet again runt. - I haven't done nothing. - No but you're a gypsy. Hey, what's this. You really should give him back his coin you know. Why do you care, you live with the gypsy brat now? I live up there. Oh, so your friend is a church mouse. C'mon let's hear you squeak. That's an old trick. I've got better things to do. What about his coin? He can have it when he can take it. Can you teach me that trick? It's not a trick. You made Rupert disappear. Hmm yea... I hadn't thought of that one. Oh and let's get into the tower. Oh! C'mon Stitches stop mucking around. I've lived here for three years now and I still don't understand that horrible man. Well this probably means Old Slee will end up owning everything. If he has his way. Why doesn't he have his way? Well if he does there will be no place for the Christmas fate. So are we going to have to move again? Your father's always taken care of us. Well I bet the new owner is rich and greedy too. Just like Slee. I don't care who your brother is you're fired. Can't I have one more chance? Raymond, you were hired to see to the gardens and you get this room for $50 dollars a month. Now the gardens are a shambles and you're three months behind on your rent again! I'm on the verge of some big money! Raymond, you're always on the verge. Now I'm tired of paying your rent myself. I'm keeping your severance check for the utilities. [soft rock guitar music] [car horn honks] [horn honking] Hi, Otis. Oh, hey Ray come on in. How you doing? There's someone here to see you, Ray. Let me introduce you to Mr. David Jackson or Thompson, Davis and Lee. Oh I was only three months late Otis, I'm gonna pay that. Just shut up Ray and listen. It would appear Mr. Kane that you are related ever so distantly to a sea captain. The late Captain Emanuel A. Faro, of uh Copenwill. Right, it's in England. That's right, England, 4000 miles away across the deep blue sea. What does this have to do with me? Specifically Mr. Kane, you are the only living relative of Mr. Faro. He's on your mother's side of course. Precisely, and as such you have a piece of property to claim in the village of Copenwill. What do you mean property? Well the papers weren't specific but when you arrive you ought to contact a Malcolm Slee. He was the gentleman that had you located. Arrive? Here's your ticket and passport to a new and exciting life, Ray. God speed, God bless and cheerios. [exclaims] Oh this is a, this is a one way ticket. Ray, I don't think I can finagle you another job, Face it, I've run out of people in town who owe me favors. But think of what might lie ahead of you, perhaps a home of your very own. Here Ray... I couldn't let my half brother leave without a going away gift, now could I? I take it everybody over there wears 'em. Wow... huh! Thanks, Otis. How's it look? You look fine, Ray. [finger picking blues guitar music] Winthrop, now... I know you have your orders but... please swing by the house just for a minute. I need to see Beth one more time. I appreciate that Winthrop. Uncle Raymond! Hello darling. Momma said you were going away to England. Well I'm afraid so but I will be back before you can say firefly. I have something for you. I want you to have this Uncle Raymond. Oh thank you darling. Don't worry about her wing, momma broke it trying to unlock my diary last night but she should still be able to watch over you. Oh you do love your old uncle Raymond don't you. Beth what are you doing in your Sunday dress? I got dressed for the garden party, momma. No mam, children and ladies do not mix. So you say goodbye to Uncle Ray and turn right around and put some play clothes on. Hey step mommaâ€™s right, I'll see you soon darling. Bye, Uncle Raymond. Bye bye. I've got a feeling the Uncle Raymond ain't coming back from England. God save the queen. [English patriotic music] [pilot] Ladies and gentlemen welcome to Heathrow airport. Our ground staff will be happy to help you with your onward journey whether it be by plane, train or bus. [finger picking country guitar music] [somber music] Ha! I knew it was here somewhere. Hog's breath I already own that one. All the clues still point to the church but your day's coming. I'm close boy, I can feel it in my bones. The treasure? What else would I be talking about but King Charles' war chest? It's been daring me to find it for 22 years. So why haven't you grandfather? Because I'm not positive where it is buried... Yet. But what if someone else finds it first? It's been lying there for 350 years, it'll be safe until I get one solid piece of evidence. It's already begun, another pauper seeking a handout! And now they're coming all the way from Germany. Good day Mrs. Stout and to you Rachel. Afternoon Mr. Crabtree, you as well Ted. I don't know why you don't pay more attention to that nice Mr. Crabtree. He's obviously very fond of you. Yes, I know he's very sweet but give me my animals you can trust them. By the time people get grown up they lose their angel eyes. Do I have angel eyes? Sure you do Stitches. They're in your heart, not your head stupid. So you really are an angel? I'm a cherub... it's not quite an angel but remember... you can't tell anyone you promised. Ok, I promised. Good. But when do you get to be an angel? Who knows? I just keep doing what Felecia tells me and one day when I've helped enough people I'll finally get to be a real angel. [hopeful music] C'mon, it's Rachel! How come you're so interested in her? She's why I'm here, I watch over people's children. I was supposed to watch over hers but she doesn't even have any. You go on, I'll look for Heidi. [soft country guitar music] Dear now what's this? Excuse me ladies I'm hunting for a fellow named Malcolm Slee. I'm looking for a fellow by the name of Malcolm Slee. Oh he lives in bridge cottage just over the way there. Thank you. Hey! It's Robin Hood. Where? Um I own the pub, The Victoria, I'm Ellen Stout and this is Rachel Blackman. Ms. Rachel Blackman Hello and this fine young gentleman Diggity. Raymond, Raymond Kane. I'm from Georgia. Thanks for the directions. An American in Copenwill, how odd. Curious to say the least. Well I need someone to help me make custard. I'm your man then Good, let's go Well have fun you too. Doesn't anyone respect tea time anymore? Well, is there a reason you're standing on my doorstep this time of day? I'm hunting for a man named Slee. What? I'm looking for a man named Mr. Slee. And who are you? Name's Kane, Raymond Kane, I'm from Georgia. America. You're Mr. Kane? Since birth. Oh, please please come in. I was expecting a letter though. He really likes you, you know? Mr. Crabtree likes any woman with hips No, not him the man we met it was written all over his face. Well I can't say I noticed. I've inherited a church? Yes. And you can see for yourself the amount of work this wonderful old church requires. I really inherited a church. That was Sir Robin Cope, the only man from this village to ever be knighted. They actually renamed the village after him in 1598. What in God's name am I going to do with a church? We'll help you sort that out. [heartfelt music] Do you have any children? No. You sure? I mean they're not off at boarding school or anything? No, I'm quite sure. You thinking of having any? You'd make a great mom. I think you've had enough sugar for today, thank you. I've gotta test it. Uh uh. I can't believe it has happened to me again. My half brother Otis is just gonna love this. I come all this way and my inheritance is a church. Well actually it hasn't been used as a proper church in quite some time. Please do sit down. No, we're all too afraid it's going to collapse some day on someone and no one wants that liability on their shoulders. Ah even better I've inherited a public hazard. Yes, I believe we're all agreed on that point... but all may not be lost Mr. Kane. It seems only right to make you reasonable offer for the property and take that burden of liability from your shoulders. What's this? [ominous music] I can have the papers ready to sign by noon tomorrow and I can convert the price into dollars if you like. Well. You got yourself a deal Indeed, indeed yes, now I'm know you must be exhausted, I'm sure you'll enjoy our local B&B. It's small but I hear quite comfortable. Well, until tomorrow then. Until noon, yes, don't forget your Cain please. Alrighty, bye bye. Goodbye, goodbye. This must be the place. [country guitar music] Can I... oh it's Robin Hood again. Where? - You need a room? - Please. Come on in then. Bedtime young hearts, come on. So are we going to have to move again? Well I'm not leaving until I find Heidi. You just get some sleep now, your father will take care of all of that. Hello, Ian, pint of the usual is it? I'm still on duty, Oscar. Italic. Well I think it's time to say goodnight. Ah come on, one more. I think he could use a hand to get home, don't you? If I wanted to help a drunk find his bed at night I'd still be married. Night all. Goodnight, Rachel. Alright, I'm buying. Well I guess she's right. But I'm gonna go, don't get up Charlie. [singing to himself] â™ª The wings of an angel â™ª â™ª Over the... and under... â™ª â™ª Could fly â™ª Come here now little angel. Let's put you right here. Let's just sit you right here on my shoulder. That's it, don't you move now. Stay right there. Oh mercy. Oh if momma could see me now. Hello there. Mis-step. Mr. Fletcher. I bet you'd like my momma Mr. Fletcher. I miss her every day. What you doing out here? Haven't you heard? I own this place. At least until tomorrow. Didn't I meet you? I was with Ms. Rachel. I'm Diggity. Kane! Raymond Kane from Georgia. [sweet hopeful music] I beg your pardon, son. Feel better? I invented that you know? You invented the sneeze ah well... I only did it so that people could say "God Bless You". Kinda cool, huh? It's a sneeze son. Everybody does it. I don't. Mr. Kane, wait up. I'm Ian Law, I was in the pub with you just now. Ah hah. You're not lost are ya? No, sir. Just out here get a little air, clear my head. I got talkin' to this little-- Huh... he was just here. Strange little fella. Ah it sounds like Diggity, he's an orphan of sorts. Stray, huh. Yea, people around here kinda look after him whenever they show up. Uh huh. Children like that come along more and more these days... pretty sad. Well talking of orphans, I'll give you lift back to Rachel's. Don't want you to become a stray now as well, do we? Sir. What was he thinking with that hat? I know, he's a bit of a wreck. That's it, if I can fix him... we've got a lot of catching up to do with you Mr. Kane. If I fix you that'll have to make me an angel. I only ever call my guests twice Mr. Kane and that's the short payment. Hey! That's morning light, don't you know it can blind a fella? Well you'll just have to do your work in the dark then. Work? Well if it's true you can't pay for your room in full Mr. Kane, you're going to have to work for it. Hey you can start by helping Artemis mend his wagon and then you can chop some fire wood for me. I can't! I got to see Mr. Slee at noon. Perfect, you've got 4 and a half hours, it's 7:30 now Mr. Kane. Seven-thirty? I'll be back at 7:35 to make the bed. Oh and it's just a suggestion but I really would get rid of those ridiculous clothes. I took the liberty of finding some that should suit you just fine. [ominous music] Mr. Slee, what can I do for you? I'm in need of your services constable, be at my home at noon today. Thank you. Well hold on a minute, what services? How you doing there Arty? Ok, just a bit more. Ok... yea. Papa, I'm going to Andy's to find Heidi. Alright. Just stay away from Bridge Cottage! That's it Raymond. Who's Heidi? Pet guinea pig. She got away recently. Alright. Appreciate your help. It's a tough job for one man. You're talking to a fellow who tried to sell dentures by mail order... now that's a tough job. Just put it in the box with the other Christmas donations there. Well... I'll see you all later, I gotta get on over to see Mr. Slee. Do you think he knows what this church means to the village? [ominous music] What are you up to, Mr. Slee? It's a fair offer and you know it. Twelve-fifteen and-- [knocking] It's him... now remember you're just here to witness the signatures, you don't have an opinion. Emma! Here let me give you a hand. Thank you dear, you take these I'll get the rest out of the car. Did you rob a laundry or something? Even better, they're from my sister in Wiggington. She's a tart. Well at least she was a generous one. Well generosity won't help much if there's no church to hold the fate in. Ah now isn't that precious. I know it's none of my business deary but you might want to set that one aside. You do know every eligible man in the village-- Yea, that's really not possible. Oh... I'm sorry I mentioned it. I always talk too much. Emma, please don't feel bad. It's just I was pregnant once... my um... my husband came home from the pub one night... one or two pints over the top. We um... we had a fight on the landing. Um... I lost the baby. [sad music] I didn't know. I'm sorry sweetie. No. Life goes on. Well rumor has it that your American has agreed to sell the church property to Mr. Slee. Is that why he's over at Slee's? Mhm. Well if that's what he's up to he can find somewhere else to stay. And he's not my American. You make a good bargain, Mr. Kane. Now if you can just have your signature. Uh huh. Make yourself useful, boy, retrieve my favorite bottle and three glasses. This calls for a wee drab. I'll get four, one for me. I've told you a hundred times, children and gentlemen don't mix. [voice of stepmother] No mam, children and ladies do not mix. Now march off and do as I say. The brashness of youth. Oh God bless you man. I beg your pardon, thank you. Your signature, Mr. Kane. I don't think I'm quite ready to sign this. What's the problem? I don't know, I just think I need to think on it a spell. You have to sign it, we have an agreement Mr. Kane. Well from what I understand the property is still mine and I don't have to do anything. Now I'll get back to you Mr. Slee, thank you for the tea. Constable, explain to Mr. Kane that there's not a soul interested in purchasing that pile of rubble. Oh I haven't got an opinion, Mr. Slee, remember? Oh Mr. Kane, let me encourage you to reconsider! Was it something the boy said? Ah! [ominous music] I don't think, grandfather. See what you've done you just better hope you didn't cross me-- Hey now. What's this? It's just something I took off that gypsy kid. And how did he get ahold of something like this? Found it somewhere around the church I think. Hog's breath! Do you know what this means? I'm turning blue. No! King Charles' war chest is hidden somewhere in that church and I had it in my hands. He'll rue the day he crossed Malcolm Slee. Get me Snidely Slee and quickly. Make that gypsy boy talk! Things happen there like the fate. It's something you yanks might call a fair but on a much smaller scale. We have one twice a year but instead of selling things the villagers donate what they can to support the needy and homeless in the surrounding area. Well from what I can see these folks are the needy. Don't they care about making money? Well at least they have a roof over their heads. Now what is it with that suitcase? Think I'll let you handle this one. And I don't need to give you an explanation. Now hold on. No, no, no cause this is my house and I decide who sleeps here and who doesn't, and you doesn't, don't. The least you can do is tell me what I did woman. Well the first thing you did wrong was being born a man and from the looks of things you went down hill from there; and don't ever call me woman! What is the use of talking to you! Precisely, Mr. Kane. You sold the church property out from under us so there is absolutely no point in you being here any longer. So why don't you just take your thirty pieces of silver and get back to America. I didn't sell the church. Is that what this is all about? I thought that was... why you met with Mr. Slee today, to sell the church and the land that the Roma's are living on. I changed my mind. What happened? I don't know. I just saw something in him and he brought back bad memories, that's all. Well he does that to everyone he meets. I am... very sorry for how I acted throwing out your belongings. If I had known you weren't selling I wouldn't have--- Oh I'm still selling just not to him. I've met men like him before, I'm not gonna be anybody's fool. [Rachel] Just get out. Bad move, Raymond. You're a nut, you know that? A dyed in the world nut. Have you always had a way with women? Are you saying I handled that wrong? And get rid of that stupid hat! You think so? She's starting to get on my nerves. Her and everyone else in this village full of idiots, and I like my hat! Me thinks he doth protest too much. Come on! [playful music] Maybe she went back to your place. She's a guinea pig, not a homing pigeon. I'm too close to Old Slee's, I'm going. Cause you're afraid of Rupert, he made you eat chicken poop. Well that was only once, I'm going. I've just remembered I've got some things to do. [ominous music] And every time the estate agent shows it to someone something goes wrong. So we'll have it for the fate then. Well I don't think Raymond will find a buyer before then he's already had two people turn him down. No luck yet then eh? Nope but the estate agent is showing it to some more people tomorrow. I don't know what the problem is. I don't want to see the church sold but I do feel sorry for poor old Robin Hood. He's such a hand chap! He's going to be sleeping up at the Roma's, the wife gave him a couple of blankets this afternoon. Have you all gone mad? Before you know it the church will be sold, the Roma's will be run out of Copenwill and your precious Mr. Kane he'll be back in America. What will you all be talking about then, hmm? Oh you'll feel better dear once we start decorating the church. What's the point? Oh I wish there was something we could do to help Raymond and spare the church. Maybe there is something we can do. Well it looks fit enough. What about the roof? Oh it's in excellent shape. I checked it out myself. And I suppose you've checked the plumbing and electricity as well? Yes I think you'll find-- [explosion and shooting sound] Thank you darlin'. Can't wait till tomorrow it's gonna be so much fun. Ms. Rachel said I could help mix some butter in the morning. After I finish I'll help you look for Heidi. And here is her new home. Thanks! What is that? Hmm? Oh... that... is a going away present from a very dear friend of mine. Oh it's an angel pin. Do you believe in angels? Well I've never been personally introduced to one but... I suppose. So you don't have angel eyes. Mr. Kane has lovely eyes, now why don't we finish it for today. There... that will make some little boy happy, huh? That is very nice, Arty. I'll finish this tomorrow. Why don't we all call it a a day. Come on kids let's say goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight my dear. - Goodnight Mr. Kane. - Goodnight Mandy. Goodnight. Night, Stitches. You got a real nice family there, Arty. Thank you. I guess you're pretty anxious to get back to your own family. Especially with Christmas just a few days away. Well... I don't really have any family to speak of so... [tender music] Well Mr. Kane I just want you to know... if you do leave... you'll be missed around here. Thanks, Arty. Well I better hit the hay myself, tomorrow promises to be a busy day. Arty, you mind if I ask you something? What do you know about Rachel? Beside the fact that she's the reason you have to sleep under a wagon? Yea... I guess that sums her up... goodnight, Arty. Have a good night. Sweet dreams. [whistling to self] I know your mom taught you better than that. You little twit! [dramatic music] Oye! My bucket! Sorry! That was fun. You know you're not as old as you look. Easy for you to say. I could get to like you you know. Ah save it for somebody else Diggity, that stuff don't stick to me too good. You should know by now you can't choose who likes you. You just get stuck with them like a gift you didn't ask for. Yea well... I better get this bread over to the church or Mrs. Roma will give me something else I didn't ask for. [people chattering] Here you go! Raymond, how kind thank you. You're welcome. Robin Hood brought this one. Stitches, would you and Diggity run back to the wagon? I forgot the other box of bows. We've all talked it over and we're all in agreement. The village wants to buy the land from you. We know it won't be the $50,000 Slee offered but we'll pay you what we can to start with. But... what about the cottage you and Gwen have been saving for, Arty you can't just throw that away. We've discussed it as a family. It's exactly what we want to do. If you can just see your way to giving us another week to come up with the down payment we need at least that much time. Oh... Mandy, I've forgotten my sowing basket. Would you mind going back to the cottage? Yes, Ms. Rachel. Thank you, it's on the table. We're all set here. Well Mom and Dad, it's Christmas again, grandfather still doesn't celebrate holidays. I always try to do something extra nice for him, he acts as if he doesn't appreciate it but I know deep down he really does. You know how he is. I guess this year's been alright for him he still misses you, Mom, a whole lot. Well I'll stop by to check on you and let you know how everyone's doing. [sad music] [ominous music] It's not safe for the chickens to be so far away from the hen. Look snipe it's old church mouse. Got any more apples in your hat kid? You know you really have an attitude problem. Hey, I wanna know where you found that gold coin! You shouldn't do that you know Wait, he's got Heidi! And I'm just crazy enough to bite his stupid little head clean off so talk! That's enough! Told you before to stay out of my way. Where'd you find it? In the church cellar behind the wall. Can I have Heidi back now? No, I think I'll eat her anyway. Can't you do something? Eat this! I told you before, leave my little brother alone! I was talking to you you know? Men, so helpless. The devil with you. [tender music] My sweet, Edna. It's unnatural for a father... to outlive his daughter, it's unnatural. Curse it! God didn't prepare me for this life. What in thunder. There was this really big-- Stop whining boy what about the coin? It's under the church at the end of the tunnel. You sure? Yes sir, I'm sure. Very well. The hunt is on. [ominous music] - Hey you got yourself a deal. - Thank you so much. - Wonderful. - Thanks, Raymond. Oh my pleasure. Yea, me too. Arty. He can't leave yet. Oh... mam. It might be possible that I was a little hasty to judge you. We have a deal Felecia! Well it might be possible that I was just... Well, well, well, well, well. And you thought I didn't know what this gaggle of near-do-wells was up to. No deals are made in this village without me, haven't you learned that yet? And your little party just ended. What's this? It's from the tax office. It would seem this building no longer qualifies for church exemption. The land has lost its tax exempt status when the lease ran out two years ago. What's all that mean, Ian? It means that Raymond as the owner owes her majesty's government quite a large amount of money. How much? Well a lot more than we can come up with. When's it due? Uh it's... hereby stated this needs to be paid by within ten days of the date... that's the day after tomorrow. How long you been sitting on this, Slee? Oh you really think you're the bull dog of the boneyard, don't you? I'm that and so much more, Mr. Kane. Just ask these good people, you see you can either pay the queen's tax the by the day after tomorrow or lose everything. Now... let's see your Yankee ingenuity figure this one out. You scum! Tut, tut, tut, Mr. Kane. You really don't want to get on my bad side. Up until now this has just been fun and games... After you're long gonna from here I should hold every one of these people personally responsible for your actions. Where you going with this, Slee? You either lose your property to the government and go home to your dog patch as broke as you arrived, or you sell it to me... for ten percent less than my original offer to cover the frustration you've caused me and go home with some money in your pocket. And I'll forget the role your friends here played in trying to buy it out from under me. Now you have until cock crows tomorrow morning. What are we gonna do, Raymond? I don't know that there's much we can do. [heartfelt somber music] Uh... Mr. Slee hold on. That's preposterous! Well it doesn't sound unreasonable to me, and this will seal the deal before the vicar returns the day after tomorrow and face it, he can match you toe to toe. How badly do you really want it? And you guarantee those gypsys will be off my property within 24 hours? Very well. And um... let's not forget about the tax. It's not fair, how am I supposed to help someone who has no faith at all? Give me something to work with here. And what about Rachel? How am I supposed to help her child when she doesn't even have one? [heartfelt music] It's just that I'm really tired and sometimes I get scared that I'm never gonna get my wish at all. It seems to me a fella who can chuck a nut like that shouldn't have too much to be scared of. I didn't hear you. Well I didn't mean to eves drop but... seeing as I did. Let me tell you something. Now... it's alright to talk to God and all, I mean everyone needs someone to talk to once in a while but... you gotta stop acting like you hear him talking back. Folks are beginning to wonder. I'm not talking to God, I'm talking to Felecia. She's my angel. Oh... well... I could tell you weren't talking to Rachel cause you were gettin' to do most of the talking. What do you have faith in Raymond? Oh... what I can hold in my own two hands I guess. That's not much. Well maybe not. Anyhow, I just wanted to tell ya that no matter what anybody says I think you're an alright little kid. A real little rooster. You say that like you're leaving. Well... I'll be heading back to Georgia tomorrow morning. I didn't wanna leave without saying goodbye. But you can't, there's still too much to do. Let him go, Diggity. He's got what he came for. There you get something in your craw you just don't let it go. You have your money now, Mr. Kane. There's absolutely no reason for you to be here any longer. You think you got everything and everybody pegged. Don't ya? No, I don't but I got it absolutely right when it came to you. Do I have to tell you everything? Don't they kiss in Georgia? You guys are hopeless. Signed sealed and delivered. I believe these people are trespassing, Constable. The deal was they could still have the fate. Very well but not a moment longer. This is private property now. I'm gonna help Artemis and Gwen pack. Grandfather, here it is. In you go boy. Well don't just stand there, I'll need a witness. That's what he was talking about. Give me a hand quickly. Push. What is this Mr. Slee? Where does it lead? If I'm right you're in for the surprise of your life. Go! Grandfather, it keeps going around to the left. Go on boy, go on boy. Going right now. Move on boy, move on. Grandfather, you were right! Hog's breath! What is it? Gonna be rich, grandfather. What do you think is in it, Mr. Slee? A king's ransom, constable. A king's ransom! Here hold this. Is this it? Hey, this... What's this! Is this what I've been searching for! What are you talking about? This is worth a fortune to the National Trust. It's not worth the cost of a small cottage, to hell with the National Trust! Well that's something, grandfather. Oh shut up you blithering idiot! Well decide what you're gonna do, I'm going back up. The air in here is stifling. [soft tender music] Well I Old Slee's gonna sit down there all night guarding his treasure? I can remember a time not too long ago I would have done the same thing. You know I find that hard to believe, after what you did for Arty, you know? No big deal I got a plane ticket out of it. You know I still don't understand why you didn't tell Rachel, she sure gave you a brow beating, one of the best I've seen. Sometimes things are better left unsaid. Besides that was between me and Arty. I sure envy that fella. I hope he realizes how lucky he is to have a close family like that. Anyhow. He taught me something pretty special. Sometimes to figure out what love is you gotta figure out what the opposite is. And what's that? Well I used to think it was hate. Now I know it's selfishness. He's got it! You owe me Felecia, he's changed and now I want my wish. Good morning. Good morning, Rachel! I've brought something for you. Look, I just wanted to say I'm really sorry about what's-- That's not plum pie or is it now? Yea well it's your favorite so... Gwen, look at this it's great. Oh great, come sit by the fire. Look, anyway guys I just wanted to come and-- You know what, we should cut this right now if only I can find where I put those knives and forks. But... I... my garden isn't very large and it's not as private as you're accustomed to but you're welcome to park your wagon there if you want to for as long as you like. Well we do need a place to put it. Our garden is full. The gate's not really wide enough to pull it through anyway. Wait a minute, what are you talking about? Mommy, it's Mr. Kane! Well he's got a nerve. [Gwen] Oh what the-- thank you, thank you so much Mr. Kane. Wait a minute, it's because of Mr. Kane here that you guys have lost your home. Hey you're packing up now God knows where you're gonna end up. Oh sure we're packing but we know where we're moving to. Yea, that's right Rachel, Mr. Kane gave us our very own cottage. Now we're finally going to have a real home. Didn't anyone tell you. I can't get anyone to tell me anything. Mr. Kane sold the church property to Mr. Slee in exchange for his own cottage. So you own Bridge Cottage. He did but he gave it to us. Isn't this wonderful! Why is it that you never cease to amaze me, Mr. Kane? I don't know. This calls for pie for everyone! Yea, pie. [hopeful music] I was gonna come by in the morning and say goodbye but you'll be at the fate. Mm I suppose I will but um... well it wouldn't be right to let you go without a hot meal. Well I appreciate that. Supper, seven-ish? Sorry? Supper, seven-ish. Alrighty. Plum pie, Raymond? Thank you, mam. And this is your favorite, humble pie. What? Did I miss something? Can I ask you something personal? Sure. How did you um... get that scar? There was an accident... when I was young. I lost my momma. I'm sorry. It was a long time ago. Anyhow. Thanks for asking. I'll um... just get these plates and we can have some coffee. Well let me help you No, no, no it's fine I uh... I like having someone for dinner. Can I ask you something personal? I suppose so. Oh ooh, ooh. Well we've been here before. Yea, I believe so. Um... you said you had something personal to ask me. Something personal? [Tea pot whistling] [window opening, plates breaking] Sorry, excuse the interruption I just wanted to see Raymond. About what? Oh nothing, nothing I just wanted to show you something at the church. But that can wait until the morning! What time do you need to leave for the airport tomorrow? Oh I don't know around noon I believe. Ok. Or maybe a little after that. Ok, well I'll let you two get back to your conversation. What else do I have to do? It all worked out. Raymond even gave Bridge Cottage to Mr. and Mrs. Roma. He never have done that before. You just don't play fair do you? Come in! Thank you. That's about all we can do. Until Mr. Slee has the rest of his things moved to the church. This is going to be wonderful! I even have my own bedroom. Slee said he'll be here by 8 o'clock. Stitches, go see what's keeping him. He's on our time now darling. I'll take another box while we're waiting. Well c'mon I'll show what I think I've found. Any idea what he's talking about? Nope. Diggity, where you been? Just around. See Slee? He's still inside the church with Rupert. Why? My dad wants him and I don't wanna go in the cellar on my own. I'll come. Thirty-one, 32, 33, 34, 34... Mr. Slee! Mr. Slee. What is it boy? My dad wants you. Does he now? Yes sir. Oh very well. You stay here... and I know exactly how much there is. Come on boy. You look hungry. I can bring you something. Thanks kid. What's that? I don't know it's happened several times this morning. So where's this going, Ian? Well the way I figure it the 15 paces left on this chart put Slee's treasure right about there. You've got to be kidding. It was under Slee's cottage the whole time. And now the Roma's own the cottage and I can't wait to tell 'em. What's that! God. [tense dramatic music] MY God what happened? We were talking and the whole thing fell through on Rupert. Quickly, get some help in a hurry! I see him! Well we better get him out of there before the whole thing collapses! I can get through! Good lad, c'mon quickly. Quickly, hurry, hurry. Ok boy, steady, steady, ok! Back! [dramatic tense music] Hey Raymond, come back and look at this! What's up, Arty? Everybody come quick! The tunnel fell in, Rupert's buried! Stitches, run and get help, anybody everybody! [tense music] Rupert, Rupert c'mon lad! Rupert are you alright? Come on son, come to me. Come on Rupert. Come on lad. Give me your hand. Come on. Good boy. Are you alright? Diggity! Diggity. Ok, son. Diggity! Diggity! Diggity! Are you alright? Are alright? Are you alright? Yes, yes you're alright. Where's Diggity? He's inside, it all collapsed. We're gonna need some tools. Ok, I'll be right back. Diggity! [tense music] - How bad is it? - Oh it's very bad. They're gonna need help getting Diggity out. Oh thank God I thought I'd lost him. I'm sorry lad, I'm so sorry. Well let's get him out of the dust. Ian, where are they? They're down there, follow the lights. George, the church c'mon! [dramatic music] The church, there's an accident. - Raymond. - Arty, give me a hand! Hey, Artemis use this. And give me that. No, no, no you need a break. Lord, there's too much dirt someone's gotta start moving it out. Diggity's gonna be ok, he has to be. Thank goodness it's Mrs. Helps. I called emergency service before I left, they should be here directly. Thank you. Diggity would tell you to have faith. Diggity's still trapped under the church. [tense music] Here's his hat! Well stop using the shovels we don't know exactly where he is and you might hit him. There he is! Come on! We've gotta get him out of there. [dramatic music] [tense music] [medic] No pulse. [medic] One, two, three. One, two, three, four. Pump. Nothing's working! How long has it been? Oh at least 15, 20 minutes. [medic] Three, two, one. Four, five. [flat-line sound] There's still no pulse. [somber music] What are ya stopping for? Come on. Raymond, come on. [somber heartfelt music] Come on. [heartfelt music] He saved my grandson you know. Are either of the parents here? Well actually the poor lad's a-- [both] Yes. They can stay. Diggity, wake up! Surely you're not dead. Stitches. We must go now. There's nothing we can do. Come on. Diggity! Diggity. Diggity! Diggity! Diggity! Wait. There are some papers you'll need to sign. Maybe we can take care of that in the morning. Oh just bring them to me, I'll see to it. He's breathing, he's alive! It's just your imagination. I really saw him breath, he's not dead. It's common it's just air escaping from the lungs. Wait, wait, I heard something. I heard that! Like I said, just air in the lung. It's a very common thing dear. [angelic choir music] Felecia, did I do it? Yes, precious you did it. But there's something you need to understand. What's that? It wasn't Raymond you needed to change, or Mr. Slee or anyone else. I don't get it. It was you. I don't get it. It was you... you had a character flaw that only you could correct. You spent all those years helping people but you weren't doing it because you loved them. You did it so you could get your wish to become and angel like me. It was a selfish love. But how come I'm still here then if I failed. Oh but you didn't fail. But you didn't fail. You showed true unselfish and unconditional love for a human being. I did? When you were willing to give up your mortal life and your dreams, to save Rupert. You finally got everything right. So now do I get my wish? Now you get loves greatest gift... the freedom of choice. What do you mean choice? What do you mean choice? That means you get to choose between being the angel you've always wanted... Or what? Or you can stay here with them... and be the child they've always wanted. I don't really have any family to speak of. You guys are hopeless. No, no, no it's fine I like having someone for dinner. Do you have any children? I lost the baby, life goes on. You got a real nice family there, Arty. If I go what will happen to them? Only God knows. [both] Yes. If I go, I can't ever come back? How could they get by without me? They need me. Diggity, it's time. I can't, I can't leave. I'm proud of you, Diggity. You'll make them a wonderful son. [dramatic heartfelt music] Oh my God! [people chattering] Still hard to believe that's all there was to King Charles' war chest. Still you have to admit when I told you the treasure was under bridge cottage and that it rightfully belonged to Artemis you were pretty upset. And to think all the years I spent looking for it. Just come and see it anytime. [Ian laughing] [Slee laughing] What's this? Something, no the village deserves. It's the deed to the church. I don't know what to say. Except thank you. Bless you. Thank Diggity. If it wasn't for you lad I'd have lost the most important thing in the world to me and I wouldn't have even known it. I have a few apologies of my own to make. Well we were mad for a minute, weren't we? Yea, I suppose we were. Don't you have something to ask her? Uh... What if she says no. What if you don't ask. Will you? I will. [crowd cheering] Hey everyone, it's the vicar! Here's a contract for the money, the bishop finally came through. [Slee laughing] What's going on? I'm not too late am I? No, vicar you're just in time-- To perform a wedding! Here's to Copenwell's new family! To Robin Hood, Maid Marianne and their son. Cheers! Cheers! Come on everybody. Cheers! Yea! This is yours. Thanks. To Heidi. Wherever she is. Everybody, time we had some snaps for the family album, this way come on kids. My dear Speck. This is a photo of my new wife, Rachel and our son we are adopting. His name is Diggity. I've finally discovered what I'm best suited for. I guess you could call it a family business. And remember, I always love you. Lots of love, Uncle Raymond. P.s. I'm returning your little angel... she took great care of me. I knew you could fix her, Uncle Raymond.
