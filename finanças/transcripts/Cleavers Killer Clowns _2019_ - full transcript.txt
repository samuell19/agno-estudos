[Tense music] [Man] What the hell is going on? What the hell the hell happened here? Where's Carly? [Woman] My god, they're back. [Girl] Mr. Palmer, wait! Mr. Palmer! [Tense music] [woman screaming] [police siren wailing] I think we're wasting our time, sheriff. He had too much of a headstart. He was driving a 50 year old ice cream truck, for Christ's sake. How much of a headstart could he have got? We've been driving in a straight line for 30 minutes. I'd say maybe enough. Listen, this is the only road in and out of town. He had to come this way, he just had to. I think we must've missed it, sheriff. You saw with he done to them girls. If she's still alive, there's a chance. We gotta take it. So we just keep driving, that's it? Keep driving. Hey, you're the sheriff, but I'm just saying, I think we lost him. Son of a bitch. [Siren wailing] [eerie music] Requesting back up on Highway East. Suspect's vehicle is stationary. Possible medical assistance required. Jody-Ann? All clear, sheriff. What the hell? [Flies buzzing] Sweet Jesus! That sick son of a bitch. [Metal clanging] Don't move! Stay right there. You're Mary-Beth, aren't you? It's okay, sweetheart, you're safe now. Come on, let's get you home. No, we can't go yet. Daddy, told me to stay here. It's okay, he's gone. It's just us. No. He's just waiting. [Man laughing] [metal clanging] [eerie music] Run. [Man laughing] Run. Don't move. [Grunting] Oh God. [Gun firing] [gun clicking] [engine rumbling] [man laughing] [door slamming] No, sheriff! Sheriff! Sheriff! It's almost five years, five years since that night. Five years of nightmares. Five years since he took Mary-Beth Palmer, the daughter. Five years since I started to follow the carnage - that lead me here. - [Somber music] One thing, I know, he loves places like this, quiet, unassuming towns. The kind of place where these things don't happen. [Children laughing] Missing women are the dead giveaway. Most of them turn up a few days later, one way or another. Usually, another. After five years, [door slamming] you start to feel like it's only a matter of time before opportunity knocks. [Sheriff knocking] Morning, sheriff. You've been out here all day? Just having a coffee, sheriff. Wasn't a genuine question, sheriff. People are complaining. They haven't tasted the coffee. Or maybe it's just not as good as Still Rivers' coffee, huh? Not even close. Maybe it'd be best if you just head back there then. You know, for the coffee. Listen, Jody-Ann, I'm trying to kind here, but you're making people uncomfortable, talking about murder and kidnapping and killer clowns. You're starting to become a problem. [Jody-Ann] I'm sure you've got bigger problems than an out of state cop. Well, I'm trying to be kind here 'cause of who you are, what you've been through, but you're an extra problem I don't need. - If he's here-- - We'll take care of it. You're not needed here. More importantly, you're not wanted. Jeez, what happened to small town hospitality? It wore thin. Listen, you've been doing this for what, five years now? Town to town, you're still no closer to catching this guy. I think it's time you went home. Why don't you head back to your motel, check yourself out? Must be people back home will miss you, miss their sheriff. There's not much left to Still Rivers. I don't think you understand what that night did to that town. I'm sure I don't, but I'm still gonna have to suggest you leave. That a suggestion, sheriff? An order. Look, sheriff or not, this isn't your jurisdiction. You're still here tonight, I'll get you checked in to one of our fancy rooms down at the station. You read me? Loud and clear, sheriff. Not the first time. I get moved along more often than I'd like. Being a cop on the Still Rivers massacre comes with it's own baggage and makes that some people uncomfortable. [Crow cawing] But maybe he's right. [Water running] Maybe it's time to let go, time to clean the slate. Start fresh back home. Besides, it's been a long time since I even had a lead. Maybe opportunities finally stopped knocking. [Door knocking] [ominous music] [suspenseful music] [bright music] Hey, asshole, what the hell is your problem? That's quite enough for tonight, Darla. Why don't you get yourself home? Well, aren't you gonna give me a ride? I'll make it worth your while. Good night, Darla. You couldn't afford me anyway. Asshole. [Eerie music] [car revving] Yeah, well, fuck you too, buddy! Goddammit. [Tense music] Oh my god. What's wrong with your face? [Darla screaming] Great, another shithole in the middle of nowheresville. Don't talk about yourself like that. Fuck off, Artie. Language, young lady. Young lady? Are you gonna let her talk to me like that? Don't start. You try and show your elders some respect, huh? We went to the same school at the same time. [Artie] You coming? I thought you meant a proper restaurant, not some trucker's dirty armpit. Well, we tried to book in at The Ritz, but out here they just think that's a cracker. Move it, small fry. You coming? [Upbeat music] Right, well, I know what I'm havin'. A heart attack if you're not careful. Hey, I'm on vacation. I can let my hair down if I want to. - Yeah, what's left of it. - Leave your father alone. I think he looks distinguished, like Bruce Willis. Jeez, knock it off, will you? We're in public. Yeah, we're about as far away from public as we can get. What are you gonna have? I'm suddenly not hungry. Something must have put me off my food. Well, I'm starving. Hey, where are you going? To the bathroom if that's all right. I hope that's all you're gonna do. Jesus, Dad, get off my case. Okay, what can I get y'all? [Tiffany] Is the chili vegetarian? Honey, the only thing vegetarian around here are the cows. If you don't like meat, you can always have the meatloaf. It's mostly bread crumbs. [Door squeaking] [flies buzzing] [groaning] - [pills rattling] - No, no, no! Fuck! Fuck! [Door banging] [tense music] [door banging] [door banging] Ocupado. [Door rattling] There's someone in here! [Ominous music] So we start up here in San Francisco and we went down through Arizona, Mexico, Texas, right through Oklahoma. I've been trying to take back roads, you know, trying to get some culture into these kids before we hit DC. My, ain't that quite a trip y'all takin'? Let me tell you, see this road right here? Takes you straight to Tennessee through some of the purtiest landscapes you have ever seen. Ah, see, hey, hey, this is why it pays and talk to the locals. They know all secrets this place has to offer. Oh, we got lots of secret around here. - [Suspenseful music] - I was trying to find you. Where have you been? We're ready to go. I was in the bathroom. Doing what? What do you think? Knowing you, you were popping those pills again. Who do you think you are? Who do you think you are? Your dad set this trip up to get away from that and those people you hang around with. The least you could do is try to act like a respectful daughter. You're not my mother, Tiffany. You're right. If you were mine, you wouldn't have turned out the way you are. You think just because you were a bitch in high school, I won't put you down right here, right now? Hey, girls, girls. Come on, open road awaits. Coming, dear. Y'all have a safe journey, now. [Ominous music] [door squeaking] Is that it? Ain't much this week, huh? Well, luckily, I have just sent some fresh meat your way. [Cleaver laughing] There's a feeling again in the pit of your stomach. When you get a lead, that lead that you know will take you to what you're looking for. This feels like one of those leads, like I'm getting close, closer than I've been in a long time. Closer to the man that I'm looking for. [Crows cawing] [gun cocking] [trunk slamming] [projector whirring] [suspenseful music] Don't move! Sheriff's department, I'm armed. Stay right where you are. Hello? Can you hear me? Hatcher? [Ominous music] Jeez! Freeze! [Suspenseful music] I said hold it! - [Grunting] - [screaming] Police, I said freeze! Wait, who the fuck are you? I was trying to help ya! The note, that was you? [Kale] Sheriff? Howells, you copy? Over. Kale, I found something. It's him. He was here. [Kale] That's the thing. We have a local here. She saw him last night. Did you copy that, Jody-Ann? Copy that. Looks like we're taking a road trip. [Foreboding music] [Chase] Please stop, I'm trying to take your picture. [Artie] Come on. Hey, come on. - Smile. - [Camera snapping] What the fuck are you doing? Taking your picture for the holiday album. Jesus, Artie, can't you keep your whatever she is in check? Man, you're such a killjoy. Why? Because I don't like people flashing lights in my face? She's just trying to enjoy herself. You should try it sometime. Very little chance of that happening on this fucking Chevy Chase road trip. I know what you mean. When Artie said sunny holiday, I was picturing more beach tan and cocktails. We're in the same boat, sister. You didn't have to come, Chase. You chose to be here. Fuck, Tan, why you always gotta be like this? Everyone's just trying to enjoy a little vacation. Vacation? This is like being hauled around in a prison truck. Y'know, sometimes you can be so ungrateful. We'd much rather be spending our summer doing something better than this but we're out here for-- For what? For my sake? Go fuck yourself, Arthur. I didn't ask for this and I sure as hell didn't ask to be a model for my brother's new piece and her amateur photography. Come on, Tanya, you need to chill out. We're young, dumb and [giggling]. Just try and lighten up. See, you look nice. I swear to god! Hey, what's going on back there? They're trying to piss me off. Artie and his whatever she is. Hey! Artie, stop aggravating your sister. Are you kidding me? She's the one who needs to get a grip. If you guys don't stop, I'll stop, we're gonna get out, we're gonna look-- [Tiffany] Larry! [Tires screeching] [ominous music] Kids, are you all right? We're okay. We're all right, Mr. Harvey. [Larry] Tanya? Why the hell did you stop like that? Oh my god, I am so sorry, I didn't see you there. Are you okay? My god, what are you doing in the middle of the road? Are you okay, honey? Um, I'm lost. Where did you come from, sweetie? I lost my way home. And where's home? Where'd she come from, Dad? There's nothing around here for miles. I've been out here an awful long time. [Camera snapping] - Are you serious? - What? It's for my holiday album? Okay, we're just gonna go wait in the van. What do you think is wrong with her? I don't know, sounds local. Probably lost a screw or two. What do we do with her? I don't know. I guess we could just take her to the next drop off point and call the cops or the paramedics or something. No way, the diner, there was a sign. Last stop for 500 miles. We could take her back to the diner, maybe leave her there? You could always take me home. - Where's home, sweetie? - [Foreboding music] The Sunny Farm. It's not far up there. That's where my daddy lives. And you're sure it's on this road? Okay, well that's what we'll do. We'll drop you there. Come on, little lady, you can ride up front with me. Hey, come on. [Engine revving] [ominous music] Found her this morning, staggering around the roads. She's been running all night, feet like stumps. Shouldn't she be getting medical attention? We're waitin' on forensics. She said she saw him? So she says. She's got quite a story. [Tense music] Darla? Do you mind? Go right ahead. I already told your boss everything I saw. If you wouldn't mind going over it again. You ain't from around here, are you? What gave it away? You don't look like one of these inbreds. Local whore, was it? That's what they call me. Real nice, huh? Real nice. Yeah. Can you tell me what you saw? That man from the news. The clown. You sure it was him? Look, I may be a whore, but I ain't a liar. And I know what I saw. It was him, the Cleaver. So what happened? He asked me to pass on a message. What message? [Foreboding music] Are you ready to chat? What were you doing at the factory? Does it matter? I'd say so. You were just found at a crime scene along with the body of a missing girl. These guys are gonna charge you with at least obstruction of justice, if not an accomplice. And you? I tried to help you. Doesn't matter what I think. I hold about as much weight here as a feather duster. Why did you send me the note? 'Cause I thought you could help. Who exactly are you? I was adopted real young. A few years back, I found out I had a sister. [Somber music] I don't expect you to know what it's like to have no idea where you come from but for me, it was like a lifeline to all the answers I've yearned for my entire life. Managed to track her down. It was real easy, as it turns out. Do you know why? 'Cause she's murdered. Do you know by whom? She was the same as me, didn't have nobody. No one to look out for her, to protect her, to avenge her. I know what that's like. And it's all I could do to try and stop him. I heard about you, that you were there that night, looking for him out here. That's why I came to you. And I, I thought you'd understand. I do, that's why I need you to tell me what you know, how to find him. Why? So you can lock him up and he can sit here alive? While all them that he killed lie six feet under. Otherwise, there'll be more. I can find him. I don't know if you've noticed, but you're not really in a position to be finding nobody. That's the deal. You get me outta here, and I can find him. That's what I've been doing this whole time, keepin' up, waiting for my chance. A chance to finish this. And how do we go about all that exactly? First, you gotta get me outta here. [Birds chirping] [crow cawing] Are you sure this is the place? Yes, sir. [Ominous music] And this is where you live? Yeah, just me and my pa. - What the hell? - What is it? Well, the gas, we're on empty. I thought I told you to fill up. I did, I'm sure I did. Well, obviously, you didn't. Dammit, Larry, how are we gonna get up to the border without any gas? His truck ain't here. He must be out but I'm sure my pa will have some gas for y'all. Yeah, we can wait for him. Come on in, he won't be long, I'm sure. He'll show you where the gas is. I'm sure he'd love to meet y'all. [Tiffany] What do we do? - I guess we'll have to wait. - You wanna go in there? Yeah, no offense, Pops, but who knows what we'll catch in there? No offense, Mr. Harvey, but it looks gross. Come on, don't be so soft. Without gas, we're not gonna make it to Tennessee unless you all wanna walk. Y'all comin'? Come on, I lived through worse in 'Nam. Your dad served in 'Nam? No, he just went there on vacation. Listen to your father. Hey, little girl, you got chai tea? Tan, you coming? I'm gonna wait in the RV. You're missin' out. I'm sure I'll survive. [Eerie music] [Announcer] The smiling face of terror. [Woman screaming] A practical joker. [Garbled speaking] With a deadly taste for revenge. What the? Jody-Ann, what the hell are you doing? I'm takin' her. She knows where to find him. Are you crazy? For all we know, she killed that woman. Don't event think about it, sheriff. Now come on, let's just talk about this. You and I both know this is a lot easier than me trying to convince you. Keys, just in case you got any bright ideas about following us. To her, please. This ain't ever gonna end well. You know that. Maybe, but it'll be an end. That's all that matters. [Tense music] [engine revving] Goddammit, Jody-Ann, what the hell are you doing? Y'all make yourself at home. I'm gonna change out of these rags. [Tiffany] Thank you. Well, it tastes as good as it looks. Oh god, who would let a child live in a place like this? I don't know, maybe it's just how people live down here. Still, it doesn't make it healthy for an innocent young girl, does it? [Chase] Ew, who keeps this kind of stuff? Uh, it's not that weird, right? I mean, maybe he's like a science teacher. Hey, where's your sister? She's in the van. Dammit, Artie, you know she needs watching at all times. She's probably out there popping pills already. She's fine. She just wasn't feeling this place is all. Do blame her? Do you remember that the reason that we're on this trip is to keep an eye on your sister? Yeah, that's pretty obvious. You think that's making her life any easier, treating her like some sort of prisoner? Well, to be quite honest, she's brought it on herself. She's only proving that she can't be trusted. Whoa, where are you going? - To get your sister. - No, you're not. You're just gonna make things worse. - I'll go. - Make things worse? Yeah, last thing we need is you pretending to be our mom. - [Chair banging] - Hey! Let him go. This doesn't taste like chai. You think they have any sugar? Jesus Christ. [Hank] Your own sister. Tell you I've heard of hefty troubles in my time, but your own sister? It's ridiculous. That said, it's all the same around these parts. Wife, girlfriend, sister, just interchangeable terms on the lips of a redneck. For you boys just joining us, you're listening to. [Eerie music] For you boys just joining us, you're listening to Hank Bushball, keeping your ears alive on the long haul. Is fine all day. Stop your grinnin', drop your linen, and listen up as we talk about all manners deep and dark. Back on our favorite subject for the Halloween season. I think someone's cooking something. [Hank] We're talking about the advance of Still Rivers five years ago today. Oh, I mean since they treat this guy lately like global warming, responsible for everything in a thousand mile radius. The fact remains he's still out there. I was never a man who believed in the devil. Let me tell you, the things I've read about that man, make your bones freeze with terror. The kids out there now, who's gonna keep them safe if he strikes again? After all, don't let this state fool ya. It's Halloween and that's - [suspenseful music] - when he comes knockin'. [Hinge squeaking] [ax whooshing] [guts dripping] [Artie panting] Oh, my god, you're. Lil' Miss Cleaver. [Cleaver thudding] [Artie groaning] [Artie collapsing] [liquid bubbling] - [eye popping] - [tense music] [lid clanking] The tea! There's something in the tea! Artie? Artie? [Cleaver] Hello, miss? Have you heard the good word [laughing]? [String tripping] [blood splattering] [footsteps approaching] Did I do good, Daddy? You did perfect, little lamb. Just one more to go. How's the coffee? Haven't tried it yet. Lucky you. It's not the best. Can we take these off now? Come on, I'm not an idiot. You don't need your hands to tell me what you know. I thought we were tracking this bastard. You're not, I am. That's not how this is gonna go. This is how this is gonna go. You're gonna tell me what you know. We're gonna track this bastard down - and then-- - And then what? - I'll bring him in. - Are you fucking crazy? We need to stop him for good. Like for good good. You said you could find him. Now, am I wasting my time here or am I dragging your ass back to Pine Meadows? We find him, we bring him in. And what happens to me after that? You go to jail, serve your time for obstruction, - if you're lucky. - What about you? I get five, most likely, if I'm lucky. This is bullshit. Maybe. But it's bullshit on my terms. So, we got a deal or we're turning back now? Fine. To find this guy, you need to know exactly how he works. Every serial killer has their own pattern. Thorn, that panda guy, all of them, they all have a pattern. Once I figured out Layton's, keeping up with him was easy. Then how come no one's caught him yet? Out here, no one's lookin'. Except you. I've always been right behind him. He appears every October 29th, 30th, 31st. Halloween. Such a cliche. It's hard to know where it'll stop. I tracked the missing girls just like you did and here he was. So you found him but you didn't stop him. That's why I left you the note. I figured you'd be more equipped with dealing with him. He's already moved on. Not far. There's only so many places between here and the county line. What's to stop him jumping the county line? He never does, ever. Not till he's done. Then we better get movin'. Y'all have a nice day now, sheriff. I must have left them somewhere. Oh! Oh my god, thank you. [Plastic crinkling] [ominous music] Hello, Dad? Artie? [Door rattling] Tiffany? [Tanya screaming] [engine stops] Why are we stopping? It's trash on the road. Where do you think you're going? To take a look. Don't worry, it's not like I can get very far. One of the first things you learn when you're tracking someone is that anything could be a clue. [Jody-Ann] This is nothing but an empty road. Yeah, in the middle of nowhere. So why is there a buildup of oil right here? Maybe someone stopped to change the tire and a million other reasons. [Misty] In the middle of the road? I doubt it. The only reason you'd stop is if something stopped you. [Jody-Ann] Something? [Misty] Or someone. [Somber music] What is it? Looks like. Is that? - Mary-Beth Palmer? - Looks like it. This could be days or weeks. Doubtful. In this Arkansas night air, it'd be long gone by now. You sure? Pretty positive. - Plus. - What? It's dated today, about two hours ago. Whoever took this photo is in a buttload of trouble. [Crow cawing] If they passed here, there's very little between here and the border. How little? About one thing. A cluster of old farmhouses, 50 miles off the highway and in the middle of nowhere. Just the kind of place he'd use. We better get movin', who knows how long we have? [Engine rumbling] Hey, sunshine. Roosters are crowing. Time to rise and shine. Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey [laughing]. - What? - [Chains rattling] What? Tiffany! What have you done to her? Dad? Tanya! Oh my god. You! You led us here. Oh, we have a clever one, Daddy. Where's Arthur, where's my son? What have you done to him? Oh, he wasn't in a great mood. In fact, he's still screaming upstairs [laughing]. You bastard, how could you? Larry? What's happening? Oh, god. I'm so glad you caught up on your beauty sleep, darling. Now, we can get started. Please, don't! If you would, little lamb. - [Tanya screaming] - [Cleaver chuckling] Okay now, let's get this party started [laughing]. What do you want, you maniac? Oh, dad, I'm sure you know how hard it is to raise a kid all on your own. What? Which one's it gonna be? What, what do you mean? Only fair to let you choose. Choose? Choose what? Which one will be the brine and which one will be the brisket? You just leave them alone! We got ourselves a prize pig. - She's gonna make a great mom. - Get away from her! Why are you doing this? Well now, papa, my dearest here hasn't had a mama in a long, long time. That just isn't right for a little girl, is it? To be without her mama. Although, her real mama was a dirty whore so she had to die! So, come on now, you choose, daddy O. [Tiffany] Larry. I can't choose. You can't expect me-- I can and I will or you will die! I'll start with this one over here! - Wait! - Help! Please come help me. Kill me, just please leave her alone. [Tanya sobbing] You have to choose me, she's your daughter. So, what does that make you? I'm his wife. [Cleaver laughing] Oh, Papa Larry, you are a dark horse. I must be thinking you have lovely daughters and one's already a mama. I'm her stepmom! I really like this one. Now, who's it gonna be? The lovely daughter or the yummy mummy? [Suspenseful music] I choose my wife. No! No! - No! - Larry, no, you can't! I'm sorry, Tanya. - No! - But your life until now as an addict, you're better off this way. Oh, that's real dark, and I'm a fucking killer clown, for Christ's sakes! [Ominous music] But I get it. You upset the wife, gonna get it right in the neck! [Cleaver slicing] [Larry coughing] [neck snapping] [both gasping] [Larry collapsing] [both screaming] Now, we just gotta figure out which one of these little piggies we get to keep and which one becomes roast beef. [Cleaver laughing] Please, I'll stay. Just let her go. Sounds like we've got company, little lamb. Why don't you go make them feel right at home? Yes, Daddy. [Tense music] [door squeaking] You sure this is the right place? You could bet your ass on it. Jesus Christ. We got a plan? Go in, take a look around. All right, okay then, I was tired of livin' anyway. [Foreboding music] Someone's been here, recently. [Floor thudding] Looks like they still are. Sheriff's department! Someone there? - [Hinge squeaking] - [blade slicing] Oh, it's a trap! I probably should have mentioned. - What? - Traps are kinda his thing. [Blade slicing] Yeah, probably worth mentioning before we walked into a serial killers lair? Well I didn't want to get in over your-- - [blade slicing] - [both screaming] You okay? [Cleaver laughing] I'm fine, just go get him. Hello? Help! [Tanya] Help, is somebody there, hello? We're down here! Hello? Please help us! [Projector whirring] [suspenseful music] Wait, who the fuck are you? Well, I guess I'm the cavalry. Well, you want to get us out of here? [Chains clinking] [gun firing] [ominous music] Mary-Beth? Mary-Beth Palmer. Somebody here wants to say hello. [Chains rattling] Sheriff? Oh my god, sheriff, I've been lookin' for you. [Suspenseful music] [gun clicking] [chains rattling] Come on, we gotta go. There's a padlock. Well, can you get it off? I'm trying, it'll take me minute. Go and start the van. What about you? We'll be right behind you. Right? Sure. Go! - [Suspenseful music] - [Cleaver laughing] Where you going, darling? This party's just getting started. [Cleaver laughing] [Jody-Ann] What's wrong with you? [Mary-Beth] He was our first. First what? What's wrong with him? He's one of our family. He was Daddy's first test. Turned out well, didn't you, Hatcher? [Hatcher mumbling] What did you do to him? We turned him mad as a Hatcher [laughing]. My god, you're just like him. What can I say? [Blades whooshing] It runs in the family. [Blades slicing] Mary-Beth, you don't get it. Your father, he's a monster. Like father, like daughter. What are you doing? Don't hurt deputy. Hey, little miss. - [Punch thudding] - [Mary-Beth collapsing] I think it's your nap time. Sheriff, we have to get out of here. [Sheriff grunting] [ominous music] Sheriff. Sheriff, wait. What are you doing? I can't. I can't live - like this. - Sheriff, sheriff, no! [Gun firing] - Shit, he's gone. - Tanya, did she get away? Not unless she learned how to fly. We have to go get her. Jody-Ann, Jesus, what happened? I found, I found Hatcher. - Where is he? - Dead. Is anyone else with you? - [Tanya screaming] - That's Tanya. I'll get her. Get on the radio, call Kale. Tell him where we are, tell him we need backup. Kale, but he'll haul us both in. Just do it! Hello, Sheriff Kale? [Kale] Who is this? Misty Lewis. [Kale] Do you know how much shit you're in? When I find you, you're going straight to jail. Listen, Howells, she needs backup. We found him. He's got a family. Sheriff, people are seriously dead up here. [Kale] I'm sendin' backup. What's your position? [Crows cawing] [tense music] I need you to wait here. Wait, what? Where are you going? I got something to take care of. The cops are on their way. What do I tell them? Tell them where we went. - [Blade slicing] - [suspenseful music] [Cleaver laughing] [Tanya panting] Here piggy, piggy [laughing]. Come out, come out wherever you are. Little pig, little pig, let me come in or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll, and I'll blow your house in. [Cleaver yelling] - [Tanya grunting] - [pipe thudding] Smart piggy. Fuck you, clown. Oh, dear darling, time to pipe down. - [Pipe thudding] - [Tanya screaming] We better get that leg off before it gets infected. Ruins the taste of the meat. - [Gun firing] - [Cleaver screaming] How about the vegetarian option? You okay? I'm stuck. [Both grunting] [Tanya screaming] I can't move it. Keep the gun on him. [Tanya panting] You okay? - No, I'm-- - [Cleaver yelling] Don't you know guns are dangerous? I prefer something more effective. Gets the blood flowing. - Goodbye, deputy. - [Jody-Ann choking] [chains clinking] Hello, fucker. [Jody-Ann coughing] [ominous music] You wouldn't shoot a defenseless little clown, now would you? Do you remember my sister? Misty, stop. Backup's here, it's over. Do ya? Do you remember her? Misty, please, don't do this. [Sirens wailing] Oh. Yes [laughing]. Do you know who I am? If you do this, you can't go back. I hope you carve up as nice as she did, little pig. [Cleaver laughing] It's over. He's done. Fuck you, clown. [Gun firing] [somber music] You're goin' away for a long time. That makes the both of us, then. [Keys jangling] Not if you're gone when they get here. What's gonna happen to him? They'll put him somewhere to rot, like old meat. [Cleaver sliding] - I prefer the fresh stuff. - [Suspenseful music] [Cleaver yelling] [both grunting] [pipe thudding] Little pig, you're tougher than I thought. It runs in the family. [Pipe thudding] [siren wailing] Jody-Ann Howells, you hold it right there. I'm not going anywhere. Neither is he. Goddamn. That's him? That's Carlton Layton, the Cleaver? That's the one. Jesus, Jody-Ann, this is a mess. Things in that house, the bloodbath. Look, if any of us keep our jobs-- [Deputy] This one needs an ambulance. Where is Tiffany? The house, you got the other one, right? And the hostage. - What? - [Ominous music] The house, his daughter was there and a woman, the hostage. What the hell are you talking about? We swept that house, there's no one in there. No one alive, anyway. Oh, Jesus. [Cleaver laughing] [dramatic music] Open wide. It's been a while, but I think y'all finally ready. Let's have a look at y'all. So, you ready to play? - Mama. - [Eerie music] [Cleaver laughing] [energetic music] ¶ Hey, honey, he ain't clowning around ¶ ¶ The Cleaver's coming so you gotta go out ¶ ¶ He's gonna chase ya, gonna make you a mess ¶ ¶ You gonna die 'cause killing is a family business ¶ ¶ Yeah, yeah ¶ ¶ Killing is a family business ¶ ¶ Family business ¶ ¶ Killing is a family business ¶ ¶ Family business ¶ ¶ She got your eyes and your red nose ¶ ¶ Your red blood, that's the game they chose ¶ ¶ The apple don't fall far from the tree ¶ ¶ They're hunting you so you'll never be free ¶ ¶ The grand prize you will be ¶ ¶ Killing is a family business ¶ ¶ Family business ¶ ¶ Killing is a family business ¶ ¶ Family business ¶ ¶ Killing is a family business ¶ ¶ Family business ¶ ¶ Killing is a family business ¶ ¶ Family business ¶ ¶ Killing is a family business ¶ ¶ Family business ¶ ¶ Hey, honey, he ain't clowning around ¶ ¶ The Cleaver's coming so you better watch out ¶ ¶ He's gonna chase ya, gonna make you a mess ¶ ¶ You gonna die ¶ ¶ 'Cause killing is a family business ¶ ¶ Yeah, yeah ¶ ¶ Killing is a family business ¶ ¶ Family business ¶ ¶ Killing is a family business ¶ ¶ Family business ¶ ¶ Killing is a family business ¶ ¶ Family business ¶ ¶ Killing is a family business ¶ ¶ Family business ¶ ¶ Killing is a family business ¶ ¶ Family business ¶ [Cleaver laughing]
