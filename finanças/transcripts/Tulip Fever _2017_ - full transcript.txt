Before you were born, Amsterdam was captivated by a flower. The tulip. They came from far away, in the East, and were so rare and beautiful, for people lost their senses in wanting to own them. Rich and poor were spending and borrowing money to join the trade in bulbs, which were going up in price all the time. None more so than the rare striped tulips that were called breakers. A new breaker came from nowhere, like an act of God, and it changed people's lives. A white flower with a God-given crimson stripe turned our lives upside down, mine and my mistress Sophia's. Sophia! It's time to go! The abbess is calling! But that was all to come when Sophia exchanged her life at St. Ursula's for marriage to Cornelis Sandvoort. - Marriage... - Come on. is a safe harbor. And you will have a fine house, a servant, and you will have children. Give him an heir, and everything will be fine. So, love, honor and obey. It's for the best. In return for Sophia's sacrifice, her siblings received safe passage to New Amsterdam in the Americas to stay with their only living relative, an aunt. Whoa. And so, Sophia arrived at the orphanage barefoot but left in a carriage. Go on. Hyah! Don't let... don't let the chickens out! Don't let the chickens out! No! No, come on! A man likes to leave something of himself behind. A son to inherit my name and fortune. My little soldier's just dozy tonight. Time to report for duty, sir. Give me your hand. There. Stand to attention, sir. Cornelis. Meet my son and heir. Congratulations. So you and your wife didn't waste much time. I hear your wife's been wasting yours. Well, not for lack of trying. That orphan girl, send her back then. You've tried enough. I'll give her six months. It's best if I give her up after that. Which reminds me. That woman in Utrecht, she keeps asking about you. Sh-She does? What does she say? Ha. She wants to know when you'll be back. Just a touch of bright plumage in the detail. A woman who's been married three years needs to keep herself... interesting. Or life will become dulled. Do you know who she is? Of course. She's Danae being made love to by Zeus. That's Antonia Hocken, the tinsmith's wife. She could tell you a thing or two about him with the brush. - Really? - Is that true? And as for your dress, it'll be ready in a week. Thank you, Mrs. Overvalt. Nutmegs. Straight off the boat. They want 200 a keg. Have a sniff. Quality is good. But look, they've added shells to make the barrels heavier. Banda Islanders up to their tricks. Offer 85. I want every one of those barrels, when they're on the quayside, I want them opened and inspected! These were happy times for me, and I would not have changed places with Sophia. She treated me like a sister, while my master rarely took notice of me. Fish again, Maria? We'll be sprouting fins. But you always like herring done in this way, sir, in sweet vinegar. But fish three times this week? And several times last week, now I recall. Why? Are you in love with the fishmonger? Will I come tomorrow? Yes. Only if you love me. I love you, Maria. Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. Willem, go. Gallop. I think my little soldier's ready tonight. Please, the candle. Shh! What? Shh. Shh! I have to get something from the apothecary. Do you have the purse? Ask him for something to lift your spirits. I should ask you. What do you take to make you so cheery? He doesn't keep it, madam. It was a relief for her just to get out of the house and away from her husband. Is this the house of Dr. Sorgh? Sorgh... himself at your service. Will you come in? Mmm. Do you know Mrs. Overvalt? She's my dressmaker. Uh, I know her, yes. And she said you were a doctor of... of female mysteries. You may speak in complete confidence. It's difficult for me. Well, let me help you. How late is it? How late is what? Oh. No. What did Mrs. Overvalt tell you? She said you would help me to conceive. To give my husband a child. Oh, yes. Mrs. Overvalt. Yes. Now I remember her. Hmm. My husband made two babies with his first wife. God took them, all three. Years ago. Many years ago. Cornelis is old, but he's very... - willing. - Hmm. - Still... - Hmm. He saved me from a life of poverty, and I must repay him. He wants a son. And I have not been blessed. Mrs. Overvalt said you can help me. Of course. This way. Thank you. There's the bed. On your back or your front, up to you. A thousand apologies! How dare you! See that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently: Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever. For all flesh is grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass... Nice pig heads! Um, I'll take... four chops and a hen, for a guilder. Four chops. Cheer up, Simon. Thank you very much. The blessings of thy bounty, in good times and bad, now and for ever, may thy servants be truly thankful. Amen. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Amen. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. I've decided to engage the services of a painter. A portrait painter. And so, I've hired Mattheus. He's been hard at work scouring the art world for a suitable candidate. Oi! I'll see you tonight at tavern. I need a couple of whores tomorrow. Bring a friend. I'm doing a tavern scene. Doing the innkeeper's daughter for Paul Nassau. Nassau can't paint tavern scenes to save his life! He's found an artist. I'm assured he's sober, - industrious and respectable. - Jan! - Jan! - His name is Jan Van Loos. He's one of the most promising young artists in Amsterdam. So his price is still reasonable. My skating scene. Hmm. The Raising of Lazarus. I'm the blind beggar. The Drunkard's Downward Path. Thank you for showing me your work. They're good, but they lack obsession. - You will make a handsome... - You think there's vanity in it? Well, there is some. And when everything else about me has been forgotten, they'll say: "Look there at that lucky old dog. Didn't he have a lovely young wife?" Yeah. A double portrait, Cornelis Sandvoort and his wife, Sophia. Obsession. God, was I sozzled. Jan, listen. I got you a commission. Double portrait, Cornelis Sandvoort and his wife. - Who? - The king of peppercorns. He's a pompous old windbag, but it's 50 guilders. - Oi, where's me money? - It's coming soon. So in the form of a struggling young artist, minding his manners, upheaval entered the house of Cornelis Sandvoort. I have an appointment. A globe for far-flung trade, scales for the weighing of our sins on Judgment Day, and death, to remind the spectator, "Vanity, vanity, all is vanity." But where would portrait painters be without a little bit of vanity? Like this, I think. And I here. Hmm? No. Here. Allow me. Hold still. Mmm. I saw the future in the mirror that day. But I didn't know it. Yes, put your brush to capturing my wife. Hmm. How's business? It is you who are in business, sir. Granted. Our Dutch republic is the richest nation on Earth. Supply and demand. That's how it goes. - Peppercorns or portraits, - Mouth. nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, Chinese porcelain, now more reliable than tulip bulbs. But, of course, my best investment was my Sophia here. Cornelis, how can you? See you on the floor. First time? - Hey? - Buying or selling? Are we talking about tulip bulbs? - We are. - Buying. Right answer. Follow me. I'll waive the formalities. Thank you, Reud. - Good man. - Silence please, gentlemen! Let me have your attention! Can't hear myself think. Willem charged headlong into something he knew only by rumor: The tulip market. It happened in the back rooms of taverns where huge sums of money were made and lost as people gambled on the color - of the blooms. - Sold! Yes. Where is this, sir? Hold on, gentlemen, please. Quiet, quiet!! He was risking everything for us. Prater, sir, do you accept the bid? - The bid is accepted. - Done. - I thank you! - Prater's agent for St. Ursula's, the sisters' tulip garden. How much have you got to spend? 18 florins. That might get you a few single colors. Prater's got a parcel of whites coming up. Don't be scared to speak up. Are they a good investment, whites? The whole market's going up. You won't go wrong. - Parcel of whites offered to the room... - This is the one. By Mr. Prater here. - Where are they? - Hey, buy, buy. In the ground a while yet. This is the certificate of ownership that changes hands. - Seven. - Seven at the back. - Seven at the back there. - Eight up here! - Eight! - Nine! - Nine! - Ten here, sir! Ten from the new face at the front. - Who's got 11? Show me 11. - 13! - 13 from the ladies. - 13 from the ladies on the stair. - 14. - Good. - 15 here. - 16! 16! 16. 17, anyone? - Seventeen. - Go on. - 18! - 18! 18 to the young man. - Can I get 19? - Do I hear any 19s? No? Mr. Prater, sir, bidding stands at 18 florins. - The bid is accepted. - Yours. Well done. Go and get the certificate. Mr. Prater, sir. 18 precisely. Many thank yous. - Very good. - Thank you, sir. Done. An excellent investment. - Congratulations. - Thank you very much. - What are you gonna bid on next? - I bid thee farewell. Yes, yes. Our church has withdrawn her patronage from painters and now it's our everyday lives which are immortalized in the rich colors of the altarpieces. We stand staring out of our lives. - They're paintings of silence. - Cornelis, let him think. He's an artist. Well, I hope so. Eyes. Hand. Please don't break the pose. Mmm. A bit tight. Where would you like me to be placed'? Stand here. Chin up. No, your chin. Gerrit. Hold Still. Flat. Gerrit. What is it? That painter... I don't want him back. He's not coming back for two weeks. My daylight hours are spoken for. I don't want him here. I don't want us to have our portrait painted. But why not? It's dangerous. Dangerous? To our standing in God's grace. It's vanity. God's grace? Come where we can sit. What is it really? It's too expensive. Not dangerous, but expensive? I don't like him. You're a whirligig of reasons. He's impudent. Well, he's an artist. But, look... I can pay him off. We'll get another. There's no lack of artists in Amsterdam. I'll get Thomas de Keyser. Yes. Get him. Anyone. Well, let it sit. And if you're still in the same mind next week, then... Faster, you wanton hussy! Oh. Come on. Okay. Come on. Faster! Move faster! Fire the cannons! Ah, my bones are shaken to bits! God, forgive me. That must be sinful. What? Now, I've changed my mind. I don't want another painter. Let that man come back. - Oh, your ladyship. - Okay. Please, may I speak with your cook? Shh. They're both at home. Mm-hmm. Apologies. Oh, your hands... - Hmm. - Mmm. Oh, Maria. - Willem? - Mm-hmm. Willem, we've been robbed. It's empty. What is it? This will see us get married. Mmm. With six children around our table. Like we said. But you haven't done anything foolish? Gomez offered to sell me the bulbs for the price of a new coach, a good horse, harness and all. It's a madness. It goes against all reason. Isn't it supply and demand just the same, Cornelis? Yes, but... If nutmegs grew like mussels, you'd get a barrelful for a florin. I had no idea I had married a philosopher of finance. Governor, a word. Forgive me. Don't move. That's the color of blue the Italian masters used for the mother of Jesus. Do you know why they dressed the Virgin in blue? Because it's the color of purity. Because it's the color which cost the most. Oltremarino. Blue from over the sea. From a blue stone mined in one place only and far away. Finger. God help me. I'm in love. I'm going to Mrs. Overvalt, my dressmaker. I wasn't asking. - Yes? - Is Mr. Van Loos at home? He's not home. It wasn't important. I'll write to her. - Pull up. - Okay. Get his arm. Get his arm to me. - Pull him up! - Okay. Oh, I get him. Pull! Took his own life over a tulip bulb. What have you got there? I've had a letter from Mr. Van Loos. The painter has written to you? Yes. What has the fellow got to write to you about? Let me see. The audacity. The painter writes to ask for my tulips. What do you say to that? Your week's wages wouldn't pay for them. That could say something about my wages. He only asks to borrow them before they lose their bloom. You should let him, sir, if you want their likeness. Well, you can take them to him in the morning. Uh, first day of the month tomorrow. I have plans with my mother. Breakfast will be under a cheesecloth in the larder. Well, my dear, would you mind taking Mr. Van Loos my tulips? Tell him I want them back by close of day. Come on, hurry up! Hurry up! Turn back from there. You may rest, Mr. Sandvoort. May I? My wife tells me our portrait pleases. You've caught her beauty, sir. As well as her innocence and purity. My wife cannot abide a compliment to herself. Is that so, Mrs. Sandvoort? If you will. First to flower, first to fall. Sister, uh, the abbess, please. - In the garden. - Thank you, thank you, thank you. You're late, young man. And Lord save us, you smell of fish. Mr. Prater says you know your business, so look sharp. The gate's locked at sundown. - I am Willem Brok. - Do you mind staying downwind? Oh. Uh, I-I bought a parcel of his whites. He said I should come here to get the certificate countersigned. - Oh, so you're not the rat catcher? - No. No. Would you kindly take me to the abbess, please? Well, unless you have a pen and ink pot about you, follow me. Is this an orphanage? We take them in off the streets, feed them, school them, and send them out to fend for themselves as kitchen maids, scullery maids... Eh, shh, shh, shh. They find husbands, or worse, or remain here as novices. Ugh, the nerve of it. Oh!. Oh. Mmm. That's better. No offense. A Gouda, red and yellow. The least rare of rarities, but our prize tulip so far. The purple and white lord is above the Gouda, but top of the scale is the crimson and white. That's rarely seen. St. Ursula's has been growing tulips for the flower market for years and years. Single-colored tulips by the bushel. I paid 18 florins for these whites. I'm told if they continue to rise, in a month, they'll be worth double. Mmm-Hmm. Let's see. "Abbess" is a courtesy title. I see. Forgive me. 50 whites, just come into bloom. W. Brok. 18 florins, hmm? A month ago, you could have had them for ten. Beautiful. What's that? That one? A miracle. It's a breaker. A breaker? Mr. Prater, sir... You appear to have sold off 49 whites and one crimson and white for 18 florins. God forgive me. God might. But I wish He, for once, wouldn't work in mysterious ways. Cut the flower and sell the bulb. You have a rare one. Eh, who are you? This is Willem's patch. Not anymore. He sold it to me. - He sold his license? - And his basket. What would you like today? Fresh bream? How about a length of eel? I've got a nice thick eel. You're not ready. It's 7 O'clock. I don't want to go. But you enjoy playing cards at the Steens'. - Last time you won. - I feel sick. You go. Well, my night is ruined. I suppose we'll need to stay home. No. I want you to go. I'm better alone. Please. They're your old friends. I feel better if I know you've got good company. I'll be home before the watch sounds the trumpet. The bidding stands at 810 guilders. Are we all done? - And 20. - 20. - 30. - 30. - And 40. - 40. - 50. - 50! - 60. - 60. - 70. - 70. - 80? - 900! - 900. - 910. - 910. - We have to be... Are we all done? Anyone for 920? 920. Thank you, Mr. De Bye. Mr. Brok, 920 guilders. - Do you accept the bid? - Yes, sir. I do, sir. Please. Sold! Well done, Mr. Brok. How much fish must you sell to bring in 920 guilders, hmm? How do you know I sell fish? Did you already name your flower, Mr. Brok? - Yes, sir. Admiral Maria. - Unusual. You're a wealthy man, now. God loves you, Mr. Brok. Well, he must love my Maria, also. "My Maria" now. Oh, no, no. My future wife. We're getting married soon. Mr. Prater, I told myself I'd stop after 800 florins. It's more than enough for me, so... for the orphans, please. No, certainly not. Would you like a hand with that, my darling? - No, tart. - You paid a fair price there, sir. It'll drop if Admirals start popping up like daisies. If not, you will double it. Next item on the stand, a single Alexandra bulb. Maria! Maria! Maria! Maria! That baby needs a drop of gin. My own mother used to say. Do you know my prize mare is in foal? And De Lesseps, the banker, has paid me a fee to reserve the foal for him to buy for ten Admiral De Keys tulips when it's born. - Did you agree? - Of course. It's free money. What do you think, Cornelis? I think De Lesseps must believe those tulips will be worth nothing... - Oh! - Oh! nothing by the time he'll get a prize foal for them. - I love you. - I love you. When I left here, I thought, "Once is everything. I can deny myself now." But then I saw you again, and I thought, "No, twice. Please, God, please twice." Let me look at you. Don't move. No, Jan. To comfort me when you've gone. You've stolen my heart. And you've stolen mine. Tell me about your family. No one has ever asked me that before. A sickness took my parents when I was young. My only family lives across the sea. Oh, darling, darling, oh... Thank you very much. What are you doing? Cornelis will come home early. I know him. - Don't go. - I must. When will you come back? Tomorrow? Oh, I don't know. You do love me, don't you? Yes, I love you. Oi! Uh, I remember you, darling. - Huh? - Oh. Someone's been celebrating away, huh? - No. - Yes? No, my life is over. Don't say that. Listen. Ooh, you're a very big boy. You got a little something for me in your trousers? - Mmm-Mmm. - No? - Just a little bit? - No! Piss off. No! Where's that filthy little whore?! Where's that little bitch just stole my purse?! I want it back. Where is she? Oi! That's my little sister you're calling a whore! Get off of me. Lads! Here's one for you! Let the Navy have him! Get him up now. Come on. Welcome to the Navy, sailor. It'll take you a year to get back. - No, no. No. No! No! - Oi, that's enough. My little soldier's ready again. Sophia... He's gone? How gone? Gone where? Nobody knows. There's rumors he's gone to sea. I really thought he loved me. My poor Maria. That's not all of it. What is it? I'm going to have a baby. - Did Willem know? - No. What am I gonna do? - Your family... - In Friesland. I'd die of shame. My father wouldn't have me in the house, anyway. Are you going to throw me out? No. What can I do? When my husband hears of it, he'll... I'll keep your secret as long as I can. I didn't want to have to do this, madam, but if you throw me out, I'll tell your husband what you've been up to. I'll tell him, miss. Hhh. How did you know? How would I not? I'll tell him. If we sink, we sink together. You wouldn't. Please, Maria. Yes, I said that. And I was ashamed. I felt the shame in my blood. It's done. Do you want to see? It's well done. What's the matter? Maria knows about us. And she's going to tell Cornelis. Cornelis. Why are you awake? God took one child and spared my wife. And when... she was in childbed again, crying out, I couldn't put the thought away from me. What thought? God heard me, and He punishes me still. Because I didn't always treat her well. It was not in your hands. I asked... that the baby should be spared and... not... If it were one or the other, that... To spare the child and take the mother. And God punished me by taking both. God has forgiven you. No. I wasn't gonna tell you so soon... but I'm going to have our child. You. Oh. Oh, my-my sweet, my sweet Sophia. Oh, praise be to God. Maria, are you all right? I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Was it valuable? - Priceless. - Oh, mmm. Six months of your wages. Cornelis, it's just a vase. It's one of a pair. So say no more about it. I made a plan to save us both. You hide your tummy,... - and I can... - Oh. I can stuff a pillow down my dress. And then what? - And then when the child is born? - And then we have... the baby in the house and you can be with it. Cornelis gets a baby, Maria keeps her job, and we will be together. - Are you mad? - You must trust me. How? How will we...? What about a doctor? I know a doctor. Dr. Sorgh. In the parlor. And bring a basin of warm water. Good morning. Where did he come from? Dr. Sorgh. Good morning. And how are we feeling today? - Blood on the sheet. - Only a drop. It was nothing. I'm sure you're right. How is your heart beating, Mrs. Sandvoort? Allow me. Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm. Nice. Neither fast nor slow. All is well, but I'd better make an examination just to be sure. Feet up. Cornelis? Please, see what's keeping Maria with the doctor's basin. Hmm. Ow! Is everything all right, my love? All is well, sir. Thank the Lord. Are there any special... instructions? Plenty of rest during the day, plenty of fresh air, nutritious soups, milky puddings. Oh, yes, of course. Most important of all. It's imperative, owing to Mrs. Sandvoort's delicate bodily constitution, no conjugal relations until the baby's safely born. - No...? - I'm afraid so. I recommend separate bedrooms. If the mother is unduly disturbed during the night, well, I fear for the child. Hmm, hmm, hmm. If you say so. As to the child, the sex, the gender,... what signs do you...? Sniff, please. Do you feel nauseous? - No. - A boy. You believe so? - A boy. - Mm-hmm. A boy, but... Maria? Will you stay, please? Cornelis, I feel a little shy. A... A boy. How are you today? Hmm. Are you all right? Feet up. Is this necessary? Not really. Force of habit. How are you feeling? I feel sick. Well, you're pregnant. You two really think you'll carry this off? What choice do we have? What a game! Do you think it's true to life, Mrs. Overvalt? Hmm. Yes. Yes, he's caught the shoulder seam, the line of the bosom. Not so good on the cuffs, but the hem stitches are quite well done. What do you ladies think of the likeness? He has found you, Sophia. As for Cornelis... With an older man like Cornelis, a likeness might be too much of a good thing. Too much of "winter and spring" about it. Well, you're beginning to show, my dear. Urgent business calls me to Utrecht. I could be gone for as long as a few weeks. Sophia, let Maria do that. We'll be fine, Cornelis. Oh, my poor dearest. It's only natural in the first months. Please go, it's all right. It is a small price... to pay. That woman in Utrecht, she keeps asking about you. Ha. She wants to know when you'll be back. And when the baby's born, what then? I don't know. Perhaps the world will come to an end before then. If I were rich, I could take you away. He would find us. He would not stop looking for me unless I was dead. I heard those bells every day. That's where I grew up when the plague left me an orphan. - My poor Sophia. - No. It was my good fortune. The sisters were kind, and we lived amongst beauty. They had a tulip garden in the courtyard. A tulip garden? Is it still there? What are we after? Buried treasure. What? Tulip bulbs. Huh? Do you have the fork? I told you to bring a fork. - This is a fork. - A garden fork. We haven't got a garden, we have a kitchen. You should've said. We should've brought a ladder. Go on, then. That's handy. What is this place? - A convent. - We're stealing from nuns? They don't belong to the nuns. They belong to... the pope. Oh, I don't mind stealing from the pope. No, no, no, no. I don't mind stealing from no pope. - Move! Move! - Gerrit. Geese! - Gerrit! - Geese! Gerrit! Ooh! Oh. I'm sorry. I'm glad to see you. Why? I thought you were dead. Good morning. Who are you? My name is Jan Van Loos, I'm an artist. I'm in love with a woman who loves me. I have no money. I can't think of anything else to say about me, except that I'm very sorry. Evidently, not a very good artist. I think I am becoming good. Why are you weighing them? The more they weigh, the more they're worth. Also, the more babies. Look. These little nodes, each one will become a bulb. Here is a node from our best bulb. It sold for 920 florins at auction. Unfortunately, we had already sold it privately for 18. Hidden amongst ordinary simple-color flowers. But it's found its way home, by the generosity of the next purchaser, who had sentimental memories of me from many years ago. Never underestimate God. He forgets nothing. I would like to get a foot into the tulip business. I think it's the answer to my problems. Will you help me? First you can get your feet among those. They belonged to a fishmonger who disappeared into the Navy. Lift them, store them, put them into the market. Replace them,... and then invest wisely with the surplus. Perhaps you'll make your fortune. We're selling! Jan! I don't feel right? Where? My head. You just need some rest. - Make your bid. - Ten! That's 49 whites worth 49 guilders. You're mad. 22 or I walk. - Done. - I have a terrible craving for... sugared almonds. Sugared almonds? I'll get some tomorrow. You're very kind to me, madam. There's an Admiral Eyck to be offered to the room. 20 florins each buys us a 50th share in a connoisseur's bulb, maybe more. Word is, by the time it goes back on the market, its value will have doubled. That's how the market works! If the market keeps going up, why is anybody selling anything if it's going to double in a month? Then we can get in early on a bulb that might triple in a month! But it can't go on forever, can it? - Oh, it can! - Why not? - Why can't it? - Mr. De Bye! I call it the theory of the greater fool. - There you are! - Are you in? Are you in? - I'm in! - Yes! Grout needs to be white, madam. What are you doing? You're supposed to be resting. Bored. You don't just wipe the ironwork. You have to polish it in the summer. He notices if you don't. And he's coming back today. You'll need a bigger cushion. We'll start the auction at 240! - We're gonna be rich. - We're gonna be rich! - 240! - 540! - Ay, 550! - 580! - 600! - Six! - 720! - Come on. Nine! Here, here, here! - Sir! - Seven! - Right over here! - Hey, go, go. 750! Do we have 800? Anyone? Eventually? I'll give you 12! Give me 1,200! The offer stands at 1,200. I'll take that bulb off you for a half-share in five Miracle cream and purples. Who are you? Your landlord's bailiff. No. It's a disgrace sending these bailiffs around and worth hundreds! If I went liquid now, I'd be a bigger fool than I look. Even bigger? Shut up, Gerrit. Hey! Hey, you forgot the nicest one! Do you see what's happening? The connoisseurs' bulbs are rising more than the common bulbs. All we have to do is put all our eggs in one basket. Yes. A single bulb. The rarer the better. Boat tickets for Mr. Van Loos. As ordered. 600 florins. Cash. Certainly. After tomorrow's auction. - 220! - 220! - 220, here. - 230! - 230! - 240! - 300! - Up 300. - Weren't you an artist? - I still am. - This is just... - Oh-ho, I see. I'm still a weaver! Every one, 500! - 550! - 600! Mr. Prater tells me you've been busy. He doesn't mean painting. You're losing your bloom and, unlike tulips, yours will not be renewed in the spring. I have a proposition. I'm worth a thousand florins in bulbs and certificates at today's prices. I'd like to invest everything in your fishmonger's Admiral. Your proposition is absurd. The Admiral Maria is not a snapdragon. It's a 2,000 florin tulip bulb. Which I'm willing to let go for 1,500... out of charitable feeling. 1,200. Fourteen. And I have to go and choose the hymns for matins. Done. I'll need a week or two. Willem? Gallop. Oh. - Oo-oh. - Maria? - Ow! - What's happening? - Ohh. - Shh. Oh, it's starting. It's starting to hurt. - Are you sure? - Oh! Cornelis! Cornelis? - I think it's starting! - Maria! Maria, go fetch the midwife! No, no, no, no. OK, go fetch the midwife! I need her here with me. Go! Go! Oh! Come here. All right. Oh! - Take it slowly. - Oh, it's coming. One step at a time. Breathe. Breathe for me. Ohhh! Oh, child. - Dr. Sorgh. - Thank God! How is she? Your midwife won't let me in. Poor Sophia has been in labor for four hours. Ow! Ow! - Who is it? - Ow! Dr. Sorgh. - Shh. - Ohh! Ahh! Ahh! Hmm. Hmm. Wait. Shh. Sophia. You're doing so well. And breathe, and... Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. - Oh, child. - Shh. Again. And again. Yes! - Mr. Sandvoort? - Yes! Mr. Sandvoort. How is she? It's fine. The birth will be fine. But I must just ask you some questions about Mrs. Sandvoort. Has she suffered with great heat these past weeks? Heat? Did she seem hot to the touch? In truth,... my wife hasn't wanted me to touch her... for many months. Ah. Well, the skin may have been painful. Why? I'm sure it's nothing. Come here. What's wrong? Hello? No answer? - Shall I get that? - Hello? My master sends me to ask Maria a question. Ask me. - Is it started yet? - Yes. - What is it? - What is what? What it is that has started. - Did he ask you to ask that? - No. What? Dr. Sorgh? Not now. Hmm, hmm, hmm. - Please, I need to speak to you. - No. - Dr. Sorgh! - Nope. - Dr. Sorgh! - Nope. - Dr. Sorgh. - Ohh! Ahh! - Sorgh. - Dr. Sorgh! Not now, please. I insist on speaking to you. If it, if you could, not choice,... let the baby go. I beg of you. In God's name, spare my wife. Isn't that up to God? God, ohh! Keep bearing down. Oh, that's it. Oh, well done. - Oh! - Oh!. Oh! Oh. ls that my baby? Thank you. Come on, child. At that price, I'm... But they were fetching over a thousand last week. Last week? Precisely. The market has changed. I'm not interested, I'm not buying. - I don't care. - You said "I'm not buying", right? Please, are you really not going to bid for this? - Ay! - The price is going up here. Please, it's not that high. - 300, come on. - 300? No. I'm sorry, Mr. Daan. Weller and her league, one week ago, they're not... Sorry, Mr. Daan. No. Yeah. Is she all right? A healthy baby, sir. Congratulations! A daughter. But, Sophia? Your attention! I have the most celebrated new bloom for many a season! The Admiral Maria. Safely wrapped in straw and stored for the man that buys it today. Why are you selling it now? - Yeah, what is it you know? - What have you heard? I'm leaving Amsterdam. I sail for the East Indies on tomorrow's tide. Well... There it is. A unique opportunity to this room. Admiral Maria. Who will bid? It was the contagion. The foul waters of our city. You must not touch her. She's with God. What sort of God is that? Why did he have to take her? I told you. Damn you! Damn you! I told you. I begged you to spare her! It was plague! Sir. By the law of the city, the room must be fumigated, - the bedding burned, - Let me kiss her. - the body taken... - Let me, let me kiss her! The room must be fumigated, - the bedding burned, - Let me kiss her! and the body taken directly to a place of burial - without funeral. - I told you! I need to kiss her! Four hundred. Thank you, madam. 400. Any advance from 400? Five hundred. Five. Five at the front. Five hundred. - 600 here. - Six here. - 700 here. - Seven here, sir. - Seven here. - 900! - 900! - One thousand! Maria. Yes, you, too. We must call a wet nurse. The wet nurse already came. She sucked well. It's God's will that your wife was taken. But it's also His will that He has given you a daughter. A beautiful,... healthy daughter. For that we must be thankful. I will care for her... as if she were my own child. There. There. We will call you Sophia. She has my nose, don't you think? I'm afraid there's a small extra charge for the pallbearers. I had to buy their silence, you understand? Of course. Do you see this? Do you know how much Mr. De Bye is paying for this? 8,000 guilders. Enough for two houses on the Herengracht. Come back later, you'll have everything I owe you, I promise. Hmm, no disrespect, sir, but I'll wait here. Do you have any libation? I've come to collect money for your tickets. Tickets? Two passagers to the Indies on the Empress of the East. And I'm not leaving until I've got money in my hands. That's me orders, sir. You leaving the country? And he's not coming back! - Do you have the cash? - I do. Do you have the bulb? I'm not accepting the certificate only. Well, I shall fetch it this instant. No, you don't. The last time, you left me waiting a whole month. What, you think I'm going to slip my leash? - Yes. - Yes. Can one of you explain to me how I'm to bring the Admiral Maria to Mr. De Bye and pay you all off if I am kept prisoner in my own house? Send your friend. Are you sober? I can't remember what a drink tastes like. Right. Take this. Bring it to St. Ursula's. They'll have a package for you. And, Gerrit, listen to me. Stay off the drink. Go. Gerrit, you old tosspot! Come and have a jar! - Hey, hey! - Nnn-Hmm. Oi, Gerrit, where you going? Oi, Sophia. You're in our house. You're free. Easy. I've done a terrible thing. What have I done? Thank you, master. What is it? A gift from our garden. - An onion. - Oh. Very nice. Nice to see it by daylight. Remember your Bible. There were two thieves. Thank you. Sorry. So sorry. Only one was saved. Hmm-Hmm, hmm. Is he coming? Gerrit. Oh, thank God! I've come for my money. Have a seat. I have to go back. I... I have to go. No, you have to stay here. Move! Move! Don't hurt the animal! That's not nice! You can't go. - No, please. - Sophia! If you go,you'll bring us all down with you. Gerrit! Gerrit the hero! Gerrit the hero! Gerrit the hero! Gerrit the hero! Gerrit the hero! Gerrit the hero! Gerrit the hero! Gerrit the hero! Tell Jan I'm sorry. Tell him the fever broke. Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! So Sophia realized there was no going back,... and no way forward. She saw too late,/i> it was a trap she had laid for herself. And she had been better dead. - Slow down. - You can do it. Come on, lads! Coming. Willem. Maria. Where have you been? Africa. Africa. Africa! - You've been to Africa?! - Listen, I've only come to hear the truth, Maria. You've been to Africa?! - Tell me the truth. - What the, tell you the truth? What are you talking about? I saw you and that bastard painter! - What? What-what? - Betraying me, Maria! - I didn't think you had that in you! - Me and the painter? I saw you, yes. That was my mistress and the painter. Willem. Willem. That was Missus Sandvoort and the painter. Shh! Shh! Shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh. She's yours. She's ours. ♪ I've been fighting gypsies ♪ ♪ I've been saving donkeys ♪ ♪ I've been fighting Bacchus. ♪ Where in God's name have you been? I've been fighting... gypsies. I've been fighting Bacchus. I fought 'em. And I won. Where's the package? Gerrit. The package. From St. Ursula's. The onion? I ate it. - I don't believe it. - I ate it. - Stupid oaf. - What? - Yeah. - You've done what? - I don't believe it. - You bloody fool. - What? - He's ruined us all. Bloody fool. Everything I... My boss ain't gonna be happy about this. We're all done for. - You're finished. - What? We'll be back. What have you done? Oh, dear. Let her stay gone, sir. Let her stay dead. Oh, sir... She was driven by madness. We all were. It's all right. It's all right. Mistress Maria, So I would address you on your marriage, which in faith, must follow hard upon. And may God bless it and bless your child. The house of the trader Sandvoort has fallen into desolation, yet, I will not have it shuttered. And although I know that you were complicit in this deceitful act, Maria, I absolve you, as I, too, have sinned. For I bought Sophia like fine silver or a precious painting, and in my desire for a child, I treated her badly. Good fortune be with you, Mistress Maria. Fill the house with new life, for it is yours. But in return, you must protect my name and preserve my legacy, as in the eyes of the world, this child is my heir. It is only you and Willem who can know the truth. Tell no one. This is our secret to keep. I wish you all happiness. I am to the Indies. Farewell. Where has she gone? She saw what she'd done. Jan... the bubble burst. I must find her. Sophia! Sophia! Two hundred. It's done. I'm sorry. I'm ruined! Jan! Oh, God! Jan. Jan! Stop! - Stop! - Sophia! Sophia! Sophia. She's gone. Sophia. Soon after, the government stepped in and banned tulip trading. Overnight, the market crashed. Thousands were left destitute. All this stemmed from a love of beauty,... a passion for flowers whose lives are even briefer than our own. But while the blooms had faded,... the paintings remained. You have brought her to life. Only to torment me the more by knowing she's dead. You know that, Mr. Van Loos? Yes. She drowned herself. We cannot say we know more than we can know. Leave the rest to God. He doesn't like mopers. Your patron brought me here. Because he wishes to commission a work from you. Think of this as a place of solace. You will not be disturbed. Stories don't end. They only go their separate ways. We take leave of them. Not knowing what comes after. Cornelis has a new life... and a family to love. As do I. What? Oopsy daisy! Oh, look at this clever little girl! Sophia! Sophia! Your story is only beginning, my little Sophia. And now you know the truth. You're named for my dear friend,... who,... despite all the wrong she did,... helped bring you into this world. - Mommy, he's jumping around. - Again? No. Help your sister through. - Jacob, make room for your sister. - Daniel. Come to the table. For what we are about to receive, O Lord, for thy blessings and thy bounty from the harvest of the land and the oceans. And for this house of Mr. Sandvoort, bless him and his new family in the Indies. For everything that we have, in good times and bad, now and forever. May your servants be truly thankful. It was Mr. Sandvoort's desire that Willem and I should live in his house, and bring you up as the daughter Sophia gave him. But now you know why we have always loved you as our own. Our firstborn, Willem's and mine, because that is what you were, and always have been. My own Sophia. Amen. Amen. Amen. Yay!
