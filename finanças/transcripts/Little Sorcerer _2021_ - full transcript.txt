Once upon a time, there was a handsome prince named Alex. One day, an evil witch turned him into a mouse and replaced him with a fake prince named Olaf. But then, came a brave and resourceful woman named Ella to Alex's rescue. Along with her friends, a sorcerer named Crystal and a pair of mice named Walter and Manny joined forces to defeat the evil witch and Olaf. However, just as she was defeated, the wicked witch mustered her magic one last time and turned Ella into stone. Looking at all Ella sacrificed for him, Alex gave up his human body so that Ella could come back to life becoming a mouse once more. Now, Ella and her friends search every day to figure out a way to restore Alex. Mmm? Mmhmm. Oh? Guys finally, I found a way to break Alex's curse. What? Really, how? We need some special ingredients. Ingredients? Then, we'll extract the magic potion and turn Alex back into a human. Hmm. Okay Crystal, tell me what you need. Hmm, it says here in this book that we first need a black feather. Ella needs a black feather. Ella needs some black feathers. Ella needs some black feathers. Ella needs lots of black feathers. I don't have any black feathers. Hmm? Hmm? - Hmm? - Hmm? Oh, thank you but we only needed one. I also need one stamen from a boom bloom. Just remember, be extremely careful because it will explode. An egg from a rainbow bird. Careful not to get caught because she can be a bit overprotective. Okay everyone, show me what you've got. Feather. Rainbow bird egg. Stamen. Oh, mystical goo, violet, liquidy, make me a potion that will write what's true. Alex, are you ready? I'm ready. So how do you feel? I feel a bit strange, like I'm light as a feather. Alex, you all right? Ella? Thank heavens we didn't drink it. Maybe he's got to drink the entire pot to turn back into the prince. Ah. Crystal, what on Earth is going on? I don't know. I did exactly what it said. Wait, I think I know what happened. The reason it failed is because I'm only an apprentice sorcerer. So what should we do now? This is all my fault. Huh, Dr. Know-it-all. Oh, we should talk to him! Know-it-all? Yes, he can help us. How do you know? Because he's a Know-it-all. I'm so weak. You stay here and rest. We'll find a way to save you. Hmm. This is Dr. Know-it-all's house? Looks pretty ordinary to me. You would now. The greatest masters all know to hide their power. Oh, uh huh. Excuse me? Hello? Anybody home? No, nobody's home. He said nobody's home. Let's be off. Only you'd believe that. Hmm, we're coming in. Wow. Ow. Ah, hey. So someone is home. I knew it. Are you Dr. Know-it-all? You're not welcome here. Get out, all of you. Sorry to disturb you, but we need your help. I'm not Dr. Know-it-all. You're really not. Dr. Know-it-all? Nope. Okay. Then you won't mind if I go and flip through his things. Don't you dare. I already am. Huh? Ah! The only thing I dislike more than mice are mice on my desk. Shoo, shoo. Are you the doctor? I am not a doctor. Message for you, Dr. Know-it-all. Doctor, here's your letter. I told you I am not. This is your invitation to the Great Forest Marathon. Oh wonderful. If you win again, you'll be a three time champion. I'm definitely going. Fine, I'm Dr. Know-it-all. So what? We really need... Nevermind. If you're actually Dr. Know-it-all, how can you not know why we're here? You just wanna know how to save your friend, don't you? Can you tell us? Everyone always comes in here with a pile of questions. It's so annoying. I bet he has no idea. He is definitely not Dr. Know-it-all. Nonsense, my reputation is impeccable. The answers are right here. See for yourself. Oh. Only the spell binder, wielder of the life stone can help you. The Lifestone. The Lifestone is hidden away in a forest castle on the other side of the ocean. The Guardian of the Forest uses the Lifestone to nurture life. And she is not gonna hand it over easily. Oh you. Dr, Know-it-all, we hear that you're the wisest person in the entire world. Hmm. And always helping others. Will you please help us? Mmm. Please? Mmm, helping you would mean provoking the Guardian of the Forest. Don't believe him, he's a liar. Right, I'm a liar. Now get outta here, get out now. I've said too much. Now leave me alone. Shoo, shoo. Please doctor, our friend needs your help. Please help us. You're back. Hmm, get outta here. Oh. Well that was the rudest turtle I've ever met. How many turtles have you met? Just one. Please doctor, we really need your help. Come on. I don't think that turtle knows anything. Our friend desperately needs help. Ella, let's go. He's just an ornery old hermit. Please. There's a cloud in the backyard that can take you across the ocean. But good luck convincing him to help you. Dr. Know-it-all, I wish you success on your marathon. Hope you win three championships. A turtle winning a marathon? That sounds ridiculous. Maybe he'll turn into a book and fly. Look at the sky, not a cloud in sight. Finding a cloud on a day like this is about as likely as a turtle winning a foot race. You don't think that turtle is pulling our leg, do you? I don't think so. Come on, let's take a break. I'm tired. You guys can keep looking. Manny, oh. It's got a tail and a nose and a mouth, too. It's a monster. Manny got eaten by the monster. Let me go. Let me go, you big pile of fluff. Uh oh. There really is a cloud and you must be him. I'll show you. Hey, give me back my wand. Crystal! Okay cloud, game on. I'm gonna make you pay. Take that and that and a little bit of this and some more of that. Crystal, stop. We still need him to take us across the ocean. Watch me tame him. - Good job, Crystal. - Good job, Crystal. I won't go easy on you this time. Crystal. What do we do now? Stay, stay away from me. Stop. No, no, no, no. I know you are a good boy. Huh? You don't mean to harm us. You just want to play with us, right? Uh huh. Look at this. Ready? Go fetch. Wee. Catch. Oh, good boy. You're so sweet. We'd like to cross the ocean. Can you take us there? Uh huh. Ella. From now on we'll call you snowball. Yay. Welcome to the crew, Snowball. Crystal, over here. Never dreamed of a day that a mouse could fly. I hope every vacation is as great as this one. Hold on, Alex. We're coming. Crystal. Crystal. Isn't the view stunning? What's wrong? You look sad. I just feel like, like I haven't been any help since the start. What do you mean? Without you, we wouldn't have found Dr. Know-It-All. But you are the one who convinced them to help us. You used your magic to protect us every step of the way. Yeah. Magic. Ever since I was little, I loved magic. Loved it so much. I've always wanted to become a real sorcerer. Ever since my master left, I started to practice on my own. But no matter how hard I tried, I just wasn't getting it. After all these years, I'm still just an apprentice. Crystal, what are you talking about? You're going to be a great sorcerer one day. This magic wand looks so out of place in my hand. No wonder I can never hold onto it. Maybe I should just stop daydreaming and quit magic. Snowball, quickly, fetch. Ella, are you okay? What were you thinking? You could have died. A magic wand is the most important thing for a sorcerer. But even if I had a magic wand, I would never become a great sorcerer. When I was little, my dad once told me that nobody knows who they will become before they grow up. Thanks Ella. I am sure you're gonna be a great sorcerer. Oh yeah, Crystal. We definitely second that. You're allowed to fall. It's what we all do, but what's really important is how we pick ourselves up. Friends, we're are all gonna achieve our dreams. Yes, we will. Snowball, we're gonna miss you. Thank you for ride. Goodbye for now. Hope we get fly like that again one day. Oh, can I come along? Sure. I wanna try too. - Ah, a talking tree! - A talking tree! Mice can't talk. Stay back. Get away. What is that? I'm the forest guide around these parts. We're looking for the palace of the forest. Can you show us the way? Of course. But how did you hear about this place? Dr. Know-It-All told us. Know-It-All, that champion from the great forest marathon? You know him? Of course. I came in second place in that race. That's great. Let's head out. The forest is not far. We'll get there in a bit. Race you there. I wanna race too. Whatever you do, don't get lost. Ready. Set, go! How are you guys running so fast? This is how fast the second place runs? What kinda race did you win? I joined the slow run event. Then the slow runner wins. Woo. I know all the famous landmarks around here. What may look like nothing. Oh, there look over there. Over there. That's Little Red Riding Hood's forest. I can take you guys to get lost once for free. Woo. Yeah, enough already. But we really need to get to the palace in the forest. What about the tooth fairy lake? Anyone wanna get tooth back? No, we don't wanna go anywhere. Oh, you'll definitely wanna check this out. Alice's rabbit hole. There you can meet my cousin. Just don't tell him how Santa Claus' slay is made. - No. - No. I can't take this anymore. Seriously. How long is it gonna take us to get there? Here we are. It's right ahead. Woo. We're here! What? Where's the forest palace? Mr. Tree, what's going on here? It's right over there. Huh? I see it, I see it. But if the road to the palace at the base of this mountain, why did you bring us all the way to the summit? If we didn't come up here, I'd never be able to show you where the road goes. Are you kidding me right now? No need to thank me. I can take you guys there myself. We'll get there in a bit. See you later. - Bye, thanks. - Thanks, bye. No worries. Wouldn't take long at all. Huh? Where'd they go? Those are some big guards. We'll lure them away. I wanna help. Hi, we're here to see the Guardian of the Forest. Can you tell her we're here? Her Highness, the garden of the forest, isn't going to see just any riff raff off the street. Oh, so that's how it is? Especially a silly girl with two mice. That's the windy side. Let's climb that way. Stop right there. What do you think you're doing? Huh? Oh. Who are you? I'm, a. You're a thief who has come to steal things, aren't you? No, no, no. I, I promise. I'm not. Let me explain. I just... Don't try to fool me. I'm. Because if you are. That would be fantastic. Wait, what? Please steal me. I can shine like the bright sun and help light your way in time of darkness. That's nice of you, but actually I'm looking for, oh. You should steal me. What is this? Well, obviously this is my head, silly. Have some manners, please. Please. You should take me. I can protect you. No thanks. I'm good. I'm actually looking for something. Can anyone help me find it? Did someone call for me? Who? Who's that? Oh. My master, I'm a genie who knows everything. I can answer three of your questions. Shouldn't that be three wishes? Nope. Oh. Next one. Wait, that counts. Yep. You only have one question left. Use it wisely. Do you know where I can find the Lifestone? Of course I do. Where? Ooh, sorry. You ran out of questions. Tata. Wait, please don't go. Well if you bring me with you, I'll make an exception and grant you one more wish. Really? Don't believe him. - Oh. - He knows nothing. Oh. Oh. Oh. You are definitely looking for me. Wow. No one can refuse a great meal from me. That's nice of you, but I'm not really hungry. That's okay if you don't want to eat, I can offer you something to drink. Oh. Go away. I found her first. But I talked you her first. - No, I saw her first. - It's clear that I'm the... - Steal me. - Steal me. You should steal me. Me, me, me. Please? Oh my, she's in big trouble. What is this place? Oh, what is this thing? Hey, who are you? Stop right there. Where did she go? She's gone. Look up there. Listen. The queen is back. Everyone go. Excuse me. - Do you where I... - I beg your pardon. Don't just lie there. Quickly, follow me. Huh? Such a pretty young thing. And yet still a thief. I'm not a thief. Breaking into a house while the master is out and you deny being a thief. Please, let me explain. Ella! Did you get the thing? Don't worry, we'll help you look. Can I help you look? All the better. Thank you. Care to explain anything else? I think we walked in the wrong house. Let me go. Let her go. I'm gonna teach this forest lady a lesson, that's what. Are you threatening me? Please. Stop tickling me. I apologize. I'm sorry. We only wanna borrow the Lifestone. You can do whatever you want to punish me. I beg you, please let them go. Hm. If you are here for the Lifestone, you're too late. The queen of desert has already stolen it. Oh no. The Lifestone has been stolen? Yes, and why on earth do you need it? We just wanna use the Lifestone to save our friend. Now that's a sweet sounding excuse. Ella, don't beg her. I can be outta this myself. A lot of spunk for a little kid. Hang on. We can recover the Lifestone for you. Oh? But in return, you have to lend it to us. The desert queen is too powerful, even for me. We have to save our friend. Please let us try. That's a pretty good offer. You've been worrying about finding the Lifestone. No one's been able to help. You think they can? There's no harm in trying. There's no downside for you at all. I agree. Huh You dare to mess with me. Oh. This map will guide you to the desert palace. And this? It will keep an eye on you for me. Should you succeed, I will help save your friend. Deal. Good luck. Your Highness. The Forest Guardian has dispatched a party to reclaim the Lifestone from you. The Forest Guardian couldn't even defeat me herself. And she thinks this rag tag, bunch of kids can take back the stone. Are you not seeking a sorcerer for your army? One of the ones in that bunch is an apprentice mage. I can help you bring her in. Hmm. Not a bad idea. And if I can convince her to join you, that in exchange, you can help me. You want me to help you retake your kingdom? Yes, your majesty. Very well. I'll leave immediately. Thank God for Ella or we wouldn't have gotten away from that Forest Guardian. Guys over here. I think I found a shortcut. This could be a much quicker way. What are we waiting for? Let's get going. Huh? Wait. Hold on. Don't go that way. I can sense something. Someone is spying on us. Relax. It'll be fine. No, it won't be fine. None of this is fine. I'm worried for our safety. Would you stop worrying? We need to find the Lifestone. Stop. What's wrong? Oh. Why do you think? That's squirrel is conjured up by dark magic? Ooh, maybe it is. No need to worry, Crystal. It's only a little squirrel. But? Watch out! And that's gotta be a flock of black magic birds. Really? Stop missing around, Crystal. Let's go. It's really dangerous here. We have to take the other path. How dangerous can it possibly be? Can you believe in a sorcerer just for once? Crystal, you don't have to be so on guard all the time. I can sense a really strong power here. We don't have time for this. We have to get back to save Alex as soon as we can. You don't think I wanna save Alex? Did you forget who's been protecting us with magic? But not everything needs magic to solve it. Crystal, I didn't mean that. Looks like I'm not needed here. No, no. I, I didn't mean that. I'll leave now. Crystal. Don't touch me. Crystal. - Crystal, please don't go. - Crystal, please don't go. Come back. Is she really going to leave us? I'm getting the feeling that this path is really dangerous. So now what do we do? We have to keep going. Hmph. Maybe we could find a place to rest to continue tomorrow. I'm so hungry. I wish I had a nice Munster, or cheddar, or provolone or even a mozzarella would do. Guys, guys, check it out. Eh. Eh? I don't think we should go in. Let's go. Wait, where did you go? Whoever owns this place is really generous. Look at all this yummy food. I can totally pig out here. I'm starved skinny. Need to replenish my physique. Guys wait, we need to say hello to our host first. Sounds good. We can eat while we wait. - Ella! - Ella! Welcome to Cat's kitchen. Ha. Leaving so soon? I insist you stay for dinner. Oh, that's awesome. There's a dinner. Stupid, we're gonna be the first course. Should I fry you or grill you? - Run! - Uh oh. Please, don't hurt him. You can't see me. You can't see me. You can't see me. I'm a pumpkin. Oh, I'm a pumpkin. I'm a pumpkin. Ha ha. You ate all my pairing vegetables! So there's a main course too? You'll see. Eat. That's delicious. What's did you say? Mm, this is the best food I ever had. Really? Sure. You are a true gourmet connoisseur. I wanna taste anything but fish. Mm,. Mm. With an unbelievable aftertaste. I've long dreamed of becoming a great chef, but no one ever seems to know how to appreciate my creations. If you don't try, you would never know what you're capable of. This doesn't sound like you. Ella told me. Ever since I was little, I loved magic. Loved it so much. I've always wanted to become a real sorcerer. How dare they doubt my magic. Who do they think they are? Did you forget who helped you when you needed a hand? Do you still consider me a friend? Will they make it to the castle without me? Poor little girl, all alone. Olaf, stay away from me! Where did all your buddies go? Let's me guess, they ditched you. No, they didn't. Don't kid yourself. They only cared about using your magic. They denied your contributions and even your magic skills. As soon as they saw your magic was useless, they kicked you aside. They don't care about you at all. It's not like that. Oh, how so? They will come looking for me. And yet they haven't, all because you're an apprentice sorcerer. But if you were to join the desert queen, then that would be an entirely different story. The desert queen? Do you think she would understand me? Not only would she understand you, she would see great value in your potential. My potential? That's right. She possesses the most powerful magic in the world and can help you become a real master sorcerer. Very well. Just need you to do something for her. To reach the desert castle, you have to pass through the Goby desert caves. But rumor has it that those caves are filled with untold dangers, monsters even. You must be very careful. What kind of dangerous monsters? I could take on anything as long as it isn't cats. Oh man, I wish I had feet so much. Hey. Excuse me, Mr. Bear. We didn't mean to disturb you. We're trying to save a dear friend. Please let us pass. You're trying to rescue a friend? You better not be lying to me. No, no, no. We'd never lie to you. In that case, you can go. But first you must help me with something. What is it? Some time ago, a while back, I got into a fight with my brother. Eventually he sent me a letter, but I'm too old and I can't see clearly enough to read it. If you can help me read the letter, you can leave. I'll help you. Dear brother. How have you been these past few years? I don't know if you're still upset with me. Ever since I stormed out after our fight, not a day has gone by that I don't regret what happened. Now that I've become a father, every time I see my boy playing and arguing with his buddies, I would remember how we used to play and fight. I shouldn't have said such hurtful things to you in anger. And I really wanna say that I'm sorry. If you can find it in your heart to forgive me, then I would like to invite you to visit us in the Northern forest. You will always be welcome in my home, dear brother. Hard to believe he's already a father. All these years in regret, it's. You know, I'm gonna go pack my bags. I need to see my brother. Only those who you care most about can hurt you so deep. - Huh? - Ella, what is it? I'm thinking of Crystal. Me too. Friends, were going back to find her. How are we supposed to find Crystal searching aimlessly like this? What's Crystal gonna do without any food? Crystal is all by herself. How is she gonna pass the night out there all on her own? Hey Walter, look, it's the Lifestone. Wait! Manny. Are you hurt? What was that? What happened to the stone? I think it's a trap. We need to get out of here now. - Ah. - Whoa. Careful, everyone. Winning the battle without firing a single shot. Olaf! What are you up to? Calm down. The real surprises yet to come. Crystal. Olaf, you creep, let her go. No, I'm working with him. But, Crystal, we're your friends. Friends don't turn their backs on each other like you did. Crystal, you can't trust him. Are you really qualified to speak about trust? How does it feel to be betrayed by your old friend? You say that Crystal was your friend and yet all you really cared about was saving prince charming. Did you ever really care about Crystal? Hey, we love Crystal. It's not your place to... And you two, Crystal, please help me with this. Help me with your magic. Have you ever done anything for Crystal besides bossing her around? Have you? Crystal, I'm sorry. This entire time you're always watching out for us, protecting us, yet I completely ignored your feelings. I was wrong. No, you were right. My abilities aren't enough. I'm not good enough to be your friend. Crystal, that's not true. We've all felt horrible about this entire thing. It's all my fault. I didn't listen. Crystal, you were absolutely right. And I've regretted not listening to you ever since. Don't lie. You never cared about a useless sorcerer like me. No, that's not true. I know everyone has talents that should be recognized and appreciated. As your friend, I should have been more supportive. But deep in my heart, you always been a brilliant sorcerer. Enough. That's it. The desert queen is waiting for us. Let's go. We're not gonna rescue Alex by just standing here. Crystal, what are you doing? Did you really think I double cross my friends? Wait, I don't get it. Crystal, I. So what do you think? This sorcerer useful after all, huh? Do you, do you forgive me? I feel much better now after giving you a piece of my mind. Way to go, Chrystal. Oh, for a second there, we really thought you were working with Olaf. You little double crosser. Didn't I tell you they'd never turned their backs on me? Looks like Crystal made a fool of you all on our own with no help from us. Okay, let's head to the Desert Queen's castle. We'll go together. Uh huh. Hey, hey, don't leave me here like this. Help. Anyone. Save me. ♪ Always knew that with you as my friend ♪ ♪ We couldn't lose in the end ♪ ♪ Never thought there would once come a day ♪ ♪ We'd go our separate ways ♪ ♪ And there's a reason why ♪ ♪ I sparkle and you shine ♪ ♪ We are two different kinds ♪ ♪ And we gotta find our light ♪ ♪ When you were gone and the magic was lost ♪ ♪ My world was dark as night ♪ ♪ I realized we were wrong at the time ♪ ♪ We're stronger when we fight ♪ ♪ Side by side ♪ ♪ Our powers undeniable ♪ ♪ Nothing can tear us down ♪ ♪ Together we're unstoppable ♪ ♪ Now that you're here and the magic is back ♪ ♪ My world is filled with light ♪ ♪ I realized you were ♪ ♪ Wrong at the time ♪ ♪ We're strong when we fight ♪ ♪ Side by side ♪ It's the castle of the desert! What kind of anti-social hermit would live all the way out here? I'll show you what the Queen's like. What are you, two little lice talking about? - Eh? - Huh? Huh? Oh great Queen of the deserts, our friend needs the Lifestone to live. Please have mercy and help us. No, it took me quite the effort to steal the stone. Steal. So, the rumors are true. You stole the Lifestone! Did I say steal? We all heard you. - We heard you. - We heard you. So what? I suggest you gently and peacefully hand the Lifestone over or else we'll tell the entire world what you did. Please don't say anything to anyone. The stone is yours. You honestly thank the stone is enough to get you off the hook. That's right, hand over all your delicious food as well. My food? No. I'll fight you to the death. Maybe the queen of the desert is actually a reasonable person. I don't know. She managed to get Olaf under her spell. We should be careful. Did you guys hear that? What's going on here? Did I collapse the bridge? Welcome to my desert castle. The queen of the desert? Right? Your Highness, we're here to get the Lifestone so that we can save our friend. That's the wrong line. Huh? Huh? What you should say is, oh great and revered queen of the desert, our dear friend must have the Lifestone to live. Please kindly show your infinite mercy and help us. Huh? No, it took me quite the effort to steal this stone. You don't think she heard all the stuff we said about her, do you? You don't think she's really gonna fight us for food, right? It was you who stole the stone from the Guardians of the Forests. The stone didn't always is belong the Guardian of the Forest. Besides, I needed it to bring this place back to life and turn this barren waste into a lush oasis. This is my destiny. Isn't there another way? However, we can come to an arrangement. And what would that be? If the sorcerer agrees to stay here and help me, then I can let you borrow the stone. Do you promise that if I'd stay as your apprentice, you'd hand over the stone? Of course. - No. - Fine, I'll stay. Hmm. No, Crystal. We can't leave you behind. The Desert Queen's magic is more powerful than mine. This is our best chance of getting the stone. But. Remember you told me I'd be a great sorcerer one day. This is my chance. You'll see. Crystal, we're not leaving you here alone. Don't worry. I'll be all right. I promise I'll stay. But first give us the Lifestone. Very well. We're really getting the stone, just like that? Huh. What are you doing? Treacherous Desert Queen. What did you give me? The real stone is right here. Crystal!. Ella get outta the way. I, I can't control myself. You despicable queen! No Ella, no! Ella! Now you can stay with your mind at rest. I won't. - Ella. - Ella. Crystal really hit us with her magic. She's gone cuckoo-kaju. No. Crystal was being controlled. We have to save her. That's a really steep climb. How are you gonna get up there? I promised Crystal that I never abandon her again. Ella. Let it go, Ella. I'm fine. You can't Ella, please. You could get hurt. Even if we could make it up there, we'd never be able to defeat the evil queen. I'm not gonna let Crystal face this all by herself. Even Crystal was captured and she's a sorcerer. How are you possibly going to save her? I have to try no matter what, otherwise I regret it. She is nuts and not in a good way. What do we do now? What can we do? Just pray she won't fall. Don't fall down, don't fall down. Stop that. Come on, Walter. Let's catch up. Ella, careful. Got it. I got it. Hang on Crystal. We're coming. I just did half a year's worth of work out in one day. How are we gonna get over there? You two climb on my shoulders. Huh? Come on, let's all go nuts together. It's the only way. No matter what, we're with you. We made it. Okay guys, when we get up there, I'm going to need your help. My little magician, have you thought it through yet? Let me go! I know you've always wanted to become a real sorcerer. Join me and you will have the chance to realize your dream. You're the one who killed my friends. Don't forget. You were the one who threw them over the edge. Why, that was you. I'd rather die I than help you. Huh? Ella. Crystal. Ella, get away from here. You're no match for her. You're just full of surprises little girl. Still alive after that fall? You're deceitful witch. Let Crystal go. You had a chance to escape with your life, but decided to come meet your fate instead. I'm not gonna abandon Crystal. And I would never back down from the likes of you. Such a touching friendship. I'm not gonna let you hurt my friends. If you wanna fight anyone, fight me. Crystal, there's no reason to waste talent like yours on the likes of them. Hey, hey. Oh. Uh. - Huh? - Hey. Witch. What are you planning to do with Crystal? My purpose, very well. Since you're going to die, I might as well tell you she can help me expand the desert. Why would you want to expand the desert? The bigger the desert grows, the greater my power will be. And in time, I shall become the most powerful sorcerer on earth. So you wanna use my magic and the Lifestone's powers to desiccate the forest and destroy the world. Exactly. Crystal, I see great promise in your magical potential. I sincerely hope you could succeed in my place one day. Mm. Well what gives you the right to set Crystal's future? Because I will allow her to become the most powerful sorcerer apart for myself. I've learned magic so I can protect my friends. I want nothing to do with power gained by sacrificing that. Crystal, you are still young. You have no idea what you should be focusing on in life. You honestly believe Crystal should listen to a common thief like you. Keep blathering your slander and I won't be merciful. Heh, what's the matter did I touch a nerve? Enough. If that's how you want to play, don't blame me for. Huh? Hey. You sneaking little mouse. Whoa. Get back here with my stone. Don't even dream escaping. Get outta here now. Not one of you are getting away today. Dare to get my way! Where's the stone? The stone is no longer your concern. If you refuse to follow me, you will suffer my wrath. Crystal. No. Hand over the Lifestone or you'll be next. You evil witch. I'm gonna make you pay! Ella, bring back the stone. As long as it's with us, she won't be able to defeat me. Out of my way. Don't even think about it. You think that stone will make you a match for me? If you're so great, then why steal the stone? The stone is wasted in your weak hands. Your corruption is not fit to possess the stone. Walter, hurry up. Manny, wait for me. Hurry, Alex is waiting for us. Ah. Ah. Oh. You are not so hard to find after all. Olaf. Give me the stone. Manny, get the stone. Got it. But we gotta take care of this annoying guy first. Stop where you are. Ah. No. Manny! Over here. Ah. Watch me. Walter, quick! Manny, catch. Give me the stone. Keep dreaming. Hand it over. Olaf! Let her go! Finally got ya. Get out of here. No. No. No! Oh, Snowball. Just in time. It must be Dr. Know-It-All who told you to come save us. The Lifestone. Guys, look at this. Don't leave me. You can't this to me again. Is that all you've got? I overestimated you. The Lifestone would never accept the touch of an evil witch like you. Heh, the Lifestone belongs with the most powerful sorcerer in the land. You again. Silly little wench. Snowball, let's go. Get the stone to the Forest Guardian. Just in time. Catch the stone. Come. No you don't. Flash your light. Finally, I come in handy. You're gonna pay for that. You! Wait. What else do you have to say for yourself? The stone is yours. I won't fight you. Don't believe her. She's a liar and a cheat. She has deceived us before. I never meant to harm anyone. I did it all for these barren lands. Did you forget when you did your Crystal? I was just going to take you to see her. Did we win? We defeated the Queen of the Desert. Before, I never would've believed in you, but now you're all truly impressive. But we lost Crystal. Crystal. I can't believe she's gone. She gave her life for us. Please, you have to save her. I'll do whatever you want. Please save her. I'm afraid I can't help you. However, the stone only has enough remaining power to save one of your friends. You must choose. Oh no. How can we choose? This is bad. But our entire journey has been to bring back Alex. Well, the only reason Crystal ended up this way is because she helped save us. No, no. There's gotta be another way. I'm very sorry. This is beyond my powers. We have to save them both. We have to. That's not possible. You must make a choice. What, now? Your Highness, if I may, save Crystal instead of me, please, I insist. Alex. Why did you say that? Crystal sacrificed herself in order to save my life. It is my honor to return the favor. If you don't bring her back, I'll never be able to forgive myself for the rest of my days. But you need the stone's power. Oh Alex, now you'll never be able to live as a prince again. It's okay. As long as we're together, that's all that matters. Please, your Highness. I've made my decision. Very well. What happened? Crystal! We're so glad to have you back. We were afraid we lost you. I missed you too, Ella. - Crystal! - Crystal! Manny, Walter, you guys are okay. Welcome back, Crystal. Alex, what happened? Did we fail? What about the Lifestone? We defeated the Desert Queen. And got back the Lifestone. Then let's use the stone to save Alex. What are we waiting for? Guys, say something. In order to save you, Alex sacrificed the chance to become human. Wait, what? No. It's all my fault. I'm the one who. You've done more than enough, Crystal. But Alex, I don't. As long as we're together, I know we'll figure it out. There's a book for sorcerers that describes an ancient spell. I mean I've heard of it, but I'm only an apprentice sorcerer. Take a look at yourself. What happened? In being healed, you have absorbed all of the Lifestone's power. Through the journey you've endured, you've already proven your worth and potential. Crystal, you're now the new Spellbinder. Does that mean? Yep. We have to find ingredients again. First, the steaming from a boom bloom. Then an egg from a Rainbow bird. Oh, at a Raven's feather. You know about this spell? All right.
