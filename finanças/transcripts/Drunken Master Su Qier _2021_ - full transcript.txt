Hurry up. Take him out. Let's go. Why? Are you still smoking? Sir, everything is cleared. Destroy them all. Yes. In the past six months, the progress of the opium ban in Guangzhou city is still acceptable. Gentlemen, you've worked hard. Our Qing Dynasty was abused and trampled by foreigners for decades. His Majesty ordered you, as the governor, to imitate Lin Zexu in destroying opium, which can be said to work miracles. Opium does great harm to people. It causes nothing but damage. We are duty-bound to destroy opium for the people. It's just, a visible spear is easily withstood, but an unseen arrow is hard to guard against. I'm afraid those backstabbers won't sit still anymore. Admiral. You must be extra careful. As a member of the Su family, I am not the one who clings to life and fears death. I can give my life for this matter, without regrets. Come on. Thank you for the rescue, vigorous man. Admiral Su, no need to mention it. May I have your name, vigorous man? I am Liu Jiang. As a matter of fact, your son is my drinking buddy. Pardon me? You mean my rebel son, Su Can? Long time no see. Hong, hurry and take good care of him. Have a good time. Drink, drink, ladies, make sure they have a great time. Good. Good. Good. Good. Fantastic, indeed. Lady Ruyu. You are endowed with both beauty and talent. Your beauty would overthrow a kingdom. It's a little token of my feelings. May it delight you. Oh my. Your Highness, it's so generous of you. It's just, it's just Lady Ruyu, she has always made a living by talent and skill, not her body. Nobody dares to refuse me on what I want. Well, well, well. Great barkers are no biters. Oh my, Young Master Su. You have come, finally. I, Su Can, am a man of my words. I made a promise to Lady Ruyu, so here I am. You brat. Do you know who this man is? You bit me. Do I have to check with your master before kicking your ass? This is His Royal Highness the Prince. Show good sense and get the hell out of here. His Royal Highness. You are truly in a leisurely and carefree mood to come to this Zuihua House and enjoy with the people. How dare you! Shanqi. Let's go. Already? Come back soon, all right? You are still reckless as always. He is a Prince. So what? Is there anyone I dare not provoke? If you say I am reckless, I will show you how reckless I am. You are annoying. This... This is from my mother. She wanted to give it to her future daughter-in-law. Take it or not, it is up to you. Our clan, the Su family, has always been simple, honest, and dutiful by nature. Now how come we have a black sheep like you? I know I have embarrassed the Su family. I neither could gain scholarly honor nor bring glory to my ancestors. But it is my life, isn't it? As your father, I don't force you to be wealthy in knowledge. All I ask is that you take the martial arts examination. In the future, if you have the honor to serve our country, you can bring some glory to the Su family. Back then, you were a First-Degree Scholar, but you couldn't protect my mother and my maternal grandfather's family, could you? You are now the Admiral. Why is my mother's memorial tablet still in the cemetery? You! Do you have no idea who you have offended? He is just a Prince. Why do I have to be afraid of him? Shuo Tuo and his party are colluding with foreign enemies to dump opium and to do harm to our people. To him, I am such a thorn in his side. And now you are conflicted with him. I am really worried about you. Don't you always tell me that a country has its laws and a family has its rules? What, is there no law that can rule him? Then, what's the use of me taking the imperial exam? I have been careful enough to have plenty of evidence of their crimes. When I can go to the capital, I will clarify this matter to His Majesty. And they, of course, will be hoisted by their own petard. You've failed? Please forgive me, Your Highness. Su Gui. Su Can. I will definitely make you both lose all standing and reputation. Your Highness, please calm down. Don't let them spoil your good mood. Pianpian. Over here, Your Highness. Nice. You do have some amazing illusions, Pianpian. It made me feel like I'm on cloud nine. Sir, this is... Let's come straight to the point. I am unlucky, Su Can is my one and only son. I do not wish him a successful career in government, I just want him to be down-to-earth, be good at something to make a living, and don't waste his time in places of depravity. Admiral, I understand your concern. But Su Can and I have known each other for many years. We are soul mates, we've never crossed the line. Now, you are trying to buy me off with such a valuable gift. You gave it to the wrong person, I'm afraid. Admiral. Please leave. Mother, do you think I don't want to study hard to make a name for myself and honor the ancestors of the Su family? But every time I pick a book up, I think of you and my grandfather's family. Mother, I miss you. Master! Master! Master, you... Why can't you be tender toward me just for a little? You know about pain now? Obviously. I just got beat up by my father and now you too? Serve you right, you brat. Your father almost got killed. And look at you, drinking all day long. Did you save my father? What do you think? Use your head. This liquor is not bad. Pianpian. Sorry for making you suffer today. No harm done, Mister Kozaki. I just think that Shuo Tuo is arrogant, domineering, greedy, and lustful. If he goes on like this, I'm afraid new problems will crop up unexpectedly. Greedy and lustful. I chose him because of that. Now Shuo Tuo has become addicted to making money through opium. You must know that we still need Shuo Tuo to deal with those ministers who are in charge of destroying opium, like Su Gui. It's just that things will be hard on you these days. As long as we can achieve our goals, everything will be worth it. Take a look, does it fit? As long as you make it, it fits. What's wrong? Can, you are so good at martial arts. Have you ever thought about taking martial arts examinations? Why are you telling me that, too? You are a good man by nature. If you keep sulking with your father, you'll ruin your bright future. If you truly want to marry me, why don't you make a bet with your father? By the time you pass the examination, as a matter of course, you will get married and settle down. Ruyu, nobody knows me but you. When I pass the examination, it will be the day when I marry you with a palanquin with eight carriers. Did Can really say he was going to take the martial arts exams? Yes, Master. However... If you have something to say, go ahead. Young Master said Lady Ruyu made up his mind. When he passes the exam, he will marry Lady Ruyu. What? Young Master also said if you disapprove of this matter, let's just forget about it. Fine. I need you to make up for what I lost today as soon as possible. Your Highness. If it goes on like this, our losses are getting bigger and bigger. This Su Gui... Your Highness. I bring news. Speak. I heard that boy Su Can is going to take a martial arts examination. Really? It's true. Your Highness. I have just the right thing for it. This... This, I had this specially made. It can make one feel refreshed a hundredfold. If this good thing is given to Su Can, his material arts examination must be ever successful. Mother, I brought your favorite osmanthus cake. Take a bite, please. Does it still taste like it used to? Mother. I've decided to take the examination. Father promised me that once I won the title, I could marry Ruyu. Mother. It would be nice if only you could see all this. Can. Can. Why are you here? I heard you were here so I came to find you. Young Master. Oh my, Young Master. Young Master. Young Master. My God, Young Master. How did you fall asleep in here? Hurry and get up. We must hurry home, you have to take the examination tomorrow. This Su Can is incredible, many matches have passed and he's invincible. The last match. Su Can versus Huang Xiong. Nice, nice. Great. Great. Great, great. Great. Su Can brings credit to his father this time, finally. Yes, yes. What happened to Su Can? Is it a craving hits? Candidate Su Can, you took opium for fame by hook or by crook. Take him. Master, Master, it's no good. Master. Something had happened to Young Master. Young Master... He took opium! He is now in the state prison on the orders of Surveillance Commissioner. What? I didn't know the Admiral was here, my apology for not waiting for you at the door. There's no harm. I heard that my son, Su Can, was detained on the order of the Surveillance Commissioner. Is that true? Your son truly disgraced you this time, Admiral. He did by all means for fame. He even took those bad things like opium. The fact that he harmed others without benefiting himself is a shame for the Su family of yours. There must be a misunderstanding. How can my son be addicted to opium when he is perfectly fine? Admiral, I understand your desire to protect your son, but with all the eyes around, I had no choice but to detain him. The ins and outs of this matter are still unclear. According to judicial procedures, you should have released my son and re-investigated it. Well, well, a country has its laws and a family has its rules. You are the Admiral, how could you seek personal gains with your power? It will be bad if someone with a wicked mind goes to report it to His Majesty. Your Highness. My son, Su Can, is innocent. Admiral Su, you're hopeless. You've tried so hard on destroying opium, yet your son broke that law deliberately. You can't even teach your son properly, you should find a private place to reflect yourself. There must be a misunderstanding. Please look into this, Your Highness. Admiral Su, have you ever heard this phrase? "Clean water contains no fish." We are just short of a right-hand man like you, Admiral Su. Why don't you go easy on us? And I will ask Surveillance Commissioner to release your son immediately. I, Su Gui, will never form a clique for evil purposes. Su Gui. Do you want to save your son or not? You disregarding His Majesty's wish and selling opium for your gain, leaving the people in the mire. I will tell His Majesty everything when going to the capital at the end of the year, and all of you will be executed. How can His Majesty trust your words alone? I've already got a lot of evidence of your evil intentions. If you'd excuse me. You! What? How did Can get involved with opium? There must be some kind of misunderstanding. But Judgment Hall said the evidence was solid. I heard that Admiral Su put aside his pride pleading the Prince and Surveillance Commissioner. They refused to release him. His Royal Highness also gave orders that he would be beheaded at noon tomorrow. Your Highness. Nothing was found at Su Gui's house. What? Useless. Please cease from anger, Your Highness. I am such a fool. Su Gui won't make an empty show of strength. The evidence he has in his hands must be a real deal. Keep looking. Dig every inch of ground to find it. Yes, Your Highness. Your Highness. Lady Ruyu of Zuihua House is asking to see you. Lady Ruyu. Greetings, Your Highness. Come on, have a seat. I wonder what brings you to my humble house. Ruyu is here because of Su Can's matter. May I ask Your Highness whether Su Can be spared? Su Can broke the law, he was detained by Surveillance Commissioner because of that. I am just a mere Prince, I can do nothing even if I want to cover him up. Whether Su Can has committed a crime or not, or why he was arrested, Your Highness must know better than anyone. Is that what you came here to tell me? I still have important work to do. Excuse me for not keeping you company. Your Highness. What do you want in return to release him? If Ruyu can do it, I will definitely... Definitely what? I'll do whatever you say. You said that yourself. I did not compel you to do anything. Shanqi, I think there is something off about Su Can's case, tell Surveillance Commissioner to figure it out, don't blacken a good man's name. Father. Father. Father. Father. Do you know who gave the order to have me killed? Shuo Tuo and his party. To him, I am such a thorn in his side. How he wish he could finish me off for good. Shuo Tuo! Shuo Tuo! Come out! Who is here disturbing my good dream? I want you to be buried with thirty people in my family. Young Master Su, why do you utter such things? Last night, I spent all night long with Lady Ruyu. Moreover, if it wasn't for me, you'd still be in prison now. Young Master Su, is this the way you treat your savior? Ah, right. Was opium good? But, Young Master Su, you certainly have got good taste. Last night, Ruyu and I had such an enjoyable night. I did find a softer, more affectionate side of her. Can. Can. Stop, I'm begging you. Please stop. I beg you, stop, I beg you. Can. Haha. Are you awake? Master. You brat. You know I am your master, which means you're fine. I know you are upset. There, there, it's all over. What matters most now is to get well, for the time being. There, there. Your Highness. Now those troublemakers have gone for good. The demand for our goods exceeds the supply once again. Great. Kozaki, you've worked hard. It's my pleasure to serve Your Highness. Your Highness. I heard that Su Can was tortured to the point he'd rather die. I heard that, too. And it's all thanks to your excellent plan. The way Su Can is right now is much more interesting than if he was dead. Oh, dear. Aren't you the beauty queen of the Zuihua House, Miss Shen Ruyu? I wonder why you condescended to show up here with my beggars' sect. I heard Su Can is here. I wonder if you, vigorous man, will take me to him. Miss Shen. Su Can is a bane of others' existence. His whole family died because of him, then he got hooked on opium. He's a loser for life. Miss Shen had better... Qingli. Stop talking nonsense. You're getting undisciplined. Get out. Sorry for my bad teaching. Can. Look who is here. Can. You have got the wrong person. I am not Can. You brat. Can. I know, I let you down. I'm so relieved to see you're fine. This is from my mother. She wanted to give it to her future daughter-in-law. Take it or not, it is up to you. I'll get going. Lady Ruyu. Wait. You brat. Do you look down upon yourself just like that? Open up your eyes. Standing in front of you now is the girl you said you would marry. Do you think Lady Ruyu is the kind of girl who would boil the hound once it caught the rabbit? She had no choice but to be with Shuo Tuo because she had to save you. No matter what happens, you owe her. Look at you now. If it were anyone else, they would make themselves scarce by now. Why is Lady Ruyu still here? Work it out for yourself. Just saying "I am not Can" and it's done? You're running away and are passing the buck. Master. Please stop. Please help me to take care of Su Can from now on. I'll get going. Ruyu. Can. Can. Stay away from me. You, stay away from me. Can. Hang in there a few more days. Master said you just had to make it through the next half month to quit smoking. Can, let's hang on a few more days, okay? Can. Can. Master. Master, I can't take it anymore. Master, I can't take it anymore. Master, I can't take it anymore. Drink. You will forget everything when you're drunk. Drink. You brat. How is it? Great. Good. Today, I'll teach you the material arts that go with wine. Watch and learn. Good. You've made a lot of progress lately. It's all thanks to Master's kindness. After this incident, you have become less arrogant and calmer. If it weren't for Master and Ruyu, I would have been tortured to death by opium addiction. It's all thanks to your self-control. I bear the blood feud of thirty members of the Su family. My father figured out that Shuo Tuo was running a clique and selling opium, then Shuo Tuo set me up to get addicted. He couldn't make a deal with my father so he killed my father for his content. Blood will have blood, I'm sure of it. Can. Curbing violence with violence is not the only way to chase away your inner pain. So I'm supposed to let him get away with it? Can. What matters most now is collecting evidence against Shuo Tuo and his party. I heard that the new minister of opium control is on his way to Guangzhou. He enforces laws impartially with upright and outspoken, just like Admiral Su. Let's meet him and tell him everything, we won't let Shuo Tuo and his party keep doing harm. Evidence. Your Highness. Yesterday, Su Can went back to Su Manor and took out a bag. Really? I saw him with my own eyes. It's absolutely true. Pianpian, go. Your Highness. Have you heard? The newly appointed minister of opium control, Imperial Censor Gu Ying, will be here shortly. His chariot has entered Guangzhou City at this moment. I heard this man was perfectly impartial and upright. I'm worried he'll ruin our business here. Your Highness. You are... Imperial Censor Gu has just arrived. I have a little token of my care. Your Highness. Gu Ying is Imperial Censor. Your Highness is giving me a hard time now. No. You are overthinking now. You have been fatigued by a long journey, this is just a small token of my appreciation. That's all. How can I deserve such a gift from you, Your Highness? You are too serious. Besides, I've already given them to you. There is no reason for me to take them back. This... Don't turn me down, Imperial Censor Gu. Well... I will accept your presents deferentially. From now on, if I can be of any use, please let me know. You're exactly the kind of man I like to work with. I've heard a lot about how generous you are for a long time, Your Highness. Now that I met you, as expected, you're full of high spirit. I have an unbounded admiration for you. It is only fitting that you and I, serving as officials of the court, should look after each other. As long as you know what to do, you can have all the prosperity and wealth you want. I will follow your lead, Your Highness. So from now on, we are on the same side. Thank you for your kindness. I will be at your service. Brother. Master. Take them to leave first. Master. This is for siding with the outsiders instead of your own people. Master! Master, let's go. Master. Can. There is nothing else that I can do. Ruyu's love for you is as deep as the sea. Those bastards came out of nowhere, I couldn't bring her out. You have to save her. Master, rest assured. I will definitely bring Ruyu back. And that traitor, Qingli, along with Shuo Tuo and his party, I must stir this gang up. Can. We beggars have always been fighting the strong and getting rid of evil, putting chivalry as our priority. Today, I will leave Dog Hitting Waddy to you. Master! You will be their acting Master. Master! Master! Master! Master! Master! Master! Master! Master! Your Highness, please spare my life. Su Can is extremely cunning. He must have hidden it. Hidden? Now we've woken a sleeping wolf, those beggars must have hidden it already. Now, where am I supposed to find it? Your Highness, please spare my life. Your Highness. Su Can and his friends had a narrow escape, but we brought Shen Ruyu back. You mean... Young Master Su! Young Master Su! Young Master Su! Lingdang? Why are you... They let me go to tell you about the exchange in the woods in the western suburbs at the hour of Rat. If you don't show up, my lady's dead body will be left for you to collect. They also said that you know what to bring to make an exchange. Ruyu. Can. Where is it? You do have boldness, Young Master Su. Cut the crap, hurry and let her go! Don't be such a pusher, Young Master Su. Since you're here, and I can tell you two are each other's sunshine, you should stay as well, Young Master Su. Ruyu! I didn't expect that old Su Gui to collect that many pieces of evidence behind my back. He really worked hard. Your Highness. No one will ever dare to stand against us again. Your Highness. I must say these new arrivals are really good. Of course, all the best things are offered to you, Your Highness. It is said that more and more people are hooked on opium in Guangzhou. I know, right? This stuff is way more addictive than the stuff I smoke. If one can't control the amount of intake, it will cost his life. Too much of this could kill people, and once you try it, you would become insane. Long ago, there was Lin Zexu who destroyed opium at Humen. Now even His Majesty can hardly be able to save himself. Besides, a vigorous anti-smoking campaign would not only cost money and people but also hurt relations with foreign countries. What for? You're right. But isn't that what you wanted? Blinded the people with opium first, and then made the Emperor a puppet step by step. Last but not least... Hey. At that time, you all will get favors. I am grateful to you, Your Highness. I am grateful to you, Your Highness. Mister Kozaki. Now the whole of Guangzhou is under our control. Not easy at all, I must say. There is an old Chinese saying that the turbulent wind precedes the mountain storm. Why don't we take the opportunity to pick up the pace? No need to rush. Now it is not the point of storming the enemy's den. When the opportunity is ripe, let them see who is the real master of the Qing Dynasty. Never expect that Shuo Tuo does have his means. After drawing Gu Ying over to our side, our plan has speeded up considerably. At this rate, we shall soon be crowned with success. Mister Kozaki. At a time like this, we have to succeed with assurance. Don't worry, I have everything under control. Kozaki. Your Highness. How's it going? We are counting numbers. They can be shipped to all opium dens tomorrow. When the money comes in, it's all yours, Your Highness. Good. Gu Ying is a smart man, unlike that Su Gui, putting his finger in the fire. With his help, it's going much smoother than it used to be. Congratulations, Your Highness. Shuo Tuo, you brigand. Imperial Censor Gu. This is... I'm a little confused. Are you son of Admiral Su, Su Can? Yes, I am. You insisted on seeing me. What is that? Although I have not passed the examination, like my father, I am determined to destroy opium. My father died before his wishes were fulfilled. As the only one left of the Su family, I am bound by my father's will. Sir. Now the Qing dynasty is suffering from internal and external troubles. How many foreign powers are eyeing to carve up our kingdom? The Shuo Tuo party even quenched their thirst by drinking poison and even used the opium trade to achieve their own interests. This truly is utterly detestable. Please help me to achieve my aim. There is still a long way to go to destroy opium. The way your father banned opium was too radical. When I find out the opium source and hidden warehouse of the Shuo Tuo party, I will need your local strength and the troops I bring to destroy the Shuo Tuo party in one fall. Heaven above and earth below, you dared to sell opium, seek power and wealth by betraying your country, deceive the people with opium, and murder the officials of the court. Surrender yourselves! A mere Imperial Censor dared to trick me? Do you have a death wish? This is a golden token from the Emperor. Seeing this golden token is equal to seeing His Majesty. Disarm and surrender quickly! I'm afraid you've forgotten where you are. You and this rabble you brought with you, don't you dare to coerce me with that. As an official of the imperial court, you know the law but break it, collude with foreign enemies, sell opium, and bring disaster to the country and people. Anybody has the right to punish you! If You all die, who would know? So you are the one who set me up with opium after stupefied me in the cemetery? You've come to your mind. You stink beggar, you think you can do anything to me if you work with Gu Ying? You flattered yourself. You have a death wish, just like your father. How about I help you out and send you to your father right now? Bastard. It's God's will and the Emperor's command that Su Can, the son of Guangzhou Admiral Su Gui, is courageous and resolute, pays attention to the interests of the whole. He was instrumental in eradicating the Shoo Tuo party. I am very pleased. The investigation proved that the cheating case in the examination of Su Can was purely planted by Shuo Tuo. Su Can is a man of extraordinary talent and has outstanding achievements in material arts. After giving full consideration, I hereby appoint him as the Scholar of Martial Arts. He has to go to the capital to assume his position on a certain day. That's all. I, as a mere subject, humbly receive the Imperial Edict. Scholar Su, His Majesty appointed you as the Scholar of Martial Arts. You should say "I, as an office of the court, humbly receive the Imperial Edict." I, as an office of the court, humbly receive the Imperial Edict. Long live the King! Scholar Su. Please stand up. Please. Sure. - Imperial Censor Gu. - Scholar Su. This month, more than 10,000 boxes of opium were seized, with a total of more than 1.2 million-catty, all of which have been destroyed as of today. Excellent. You all have worked hard. Thank His Majesty's graciousness. At last, we have fulfilled our mission. But it's not the end of the road of opium destruction. There is still a long way to go. We will have to go on this road for a good while. I believe that people of the same mind can cut through gold. Sooner or later, these poisons will disappear completely. The western powers wanted to divide our Qing Dynasty with opium. It's just a pipe dream. Hope so. It must be so.
