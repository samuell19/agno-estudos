- Dad, can I ask you something? - Sure. - Can I have a horse? - No. But it's not fair. All my friends have horses. You use my horse on special occasions. The family nag? Gussy gets you where you want to go. Unless you want to go uphill. Abagail, times are tough. We're about to have a revolution. I practically have to drag customers in off the street, and you want a horse? Uh-huh. Ahh, good evening, citizen, And welcome to the Cock and Hound Inn. You'll be staying in Philadelphia long? Uh, just the night. Uh, just one night? I know this is the city of brotherly love, but we have some pretty spirited sisters, too. I'll put you down for a week. The night. Father! Come quick! What is it, Eliza? It's this strand of my hair. It's not as flaxen as it used to be. Perhaps it's someone else's hair. Please, it's much more flaxen than anybody else's. Mother! You said you were staying the week? - The night. - The night. Did I tell you our weekly rate? With all this talk about revolution, Philadelphia is a very dangerous place to be. Revolution? Where, here? That's the first I've heard of it. I've placed your wager on when the shooting will start. I got you good odds on Tuesday at 9:00. There isn't going to be any shooting. Of course there is. That's how you start a revolution. Excuse me. Could you please ring for the bellman? Oh, of course. Ahh, there you are, Burt. Well, it certainly seems every bit as flaxen as it was before. It's not just my hair. It's my life. I want to get married. I want to live in a big house With lots of servants Who will skim the scum off my hot milk baths. You have a bad habit of interrupting when-- If you don't do something about Maude soon, I'm never getting married. Of course you will. Why do I even talk to you? I don't know. Maude is the eldest, So I can't get married until she does. You're only 16. Mother was married and pregnant at 16. That was an accident. He means the marriage. We were talking about me. I want to get married. Since Maude broke up with Ben, she's met nobody. They're not exactly lining up to meet her. I don't know why. Maude is intelligent. She's mature. That says something. Yes-- "will die a virgin." Eliza's beginning to remind me more Of that great aunt of yours that was hanged in Salem. Mother, father. I have the most wonderful news. This morning I became engaged-- Oh, Maude. Thank god. In a conversation with deacon Pratt Who urged me to enter the library spelling bee, And I won. Aren't you pleased? Yes, we're just sorry we weren't there to hear you spell. Mnemonic. What? M-n-e-m-o-n-i-c. It was my winning word. It refers to a memory-aiding device. [pounding] For instance, that pounding reminds me there's a customer out there dying for a beer. Then get him one. Right away. Maude, just a minute. Is he unattached? I don't know. Well, 50-50 odds are good enough for me. Now get out there. Yes, mother. I play the cards I'm dealt. Play a game of solitaire. I've got an inn to run. I've got an idea. Next week is the annual freemasons' ball. Every eligible young man in Philadelphia will be there, including Ben. What time can Ben pick you all up? We'll buy Maude a new dress, and I-- We can't afford it. Maude's not that big a problem. Aah! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not usually this clumsy. Well, actually, I am. There's a word for it. It's called maladroitness. Oh, Maude. W-wipe up the man's lap. Bad idea. Bad idea, Maude. Let me do it. Uh, worse idea. No, don't go, sir. Don't touch me. I'll get you another beer. Don't touch me. We deliver! Oh, father, I'm sorry about the beer. What's the profit in one beer anyway? .87 shillings. I calculated the net based-- Good. Fine. Just clean up. Abagail. In the street, Abagail? It's Abbie! I may not have much time. I'm a minuteman. I could be shot at any moment. You got that right. I'm not too keen on these street-corner revolutionaries you've been associating with. They're called patriots, and they're trying to change things. Looking like that? Dad, these are the seventies, not the fifties. You think because I'm your father I didn't take part in protests when I was young. Our generation invented the slogan, "no taxation without representation". Can I do my homework? I wish you would. Is it Halloween already? To make the proper impression when you arrive at the ball in your rented carriage, you should have a proper coachman. You look like an idiot. Thank you. You know, they used to say that about me father. If only he were alive to hear it said about me. I'm sure he died knowing it. We are not going to the ball, And I just saw your youngest daughter kissing a minuteman. After your performance, I wouldn't be so critical of minutemen. I'm sorry, darling. I stand emasculated. And we ARE going to the ball. We're NOT going to the ball. You'll change your mind. Oh, no. I won't. You saw how Eliza acted. Abbie's right behind her. Until Maude gets married and out of the house, life will be living hell, and you won't like the heat. Oh, my god! I do not! Now what is it? The governor pulled up. We're not letting him in. Of course not. Where would he find a seat? He's British. They're ruthless, cold-blooded tyrants. Maybe they're a little cranky. We did dump a lot of their tea. You don't like the British. I despise them, and those incompetent, ridiculous fools they send here to govern us. Ahh, governor Massengill, what an honor, and I might say, a pleasure to have you visit us. Proctor, are you kissing my bottom again? Of course, but if you're going to kiss bottom, why not kiss the best? I think I'm going to be sick. Why don't you go upstairs and lie down? Why don't you both go upstairs? Your usual? Yes, a glass of your finest claret. One finest claret coming up. Ooh, that is the manliest of scents you have on. Kissing bottom again. I like that. What am I going to do? The politicians back home are hounding me for more money. [loud chewing] Stop that. But I've already taxed everything-- Uh, clothing, stamps, tea, even the wine people drink. What else is left? Oh, heck, why don't we just, uh, tax peoples incomes and be done with it? No, no politician would ever be that stupid. Mmm. What are you doing? Why not tax candles? Candles? Yes. Most taxable items are tied to the ups and downs of people's incomes, But at night everyone needs to see, so revenue from a candle tax would remain constant. Constant revenue. Oh, I like that. A candle tax! Well, I--I--I must go. That one is a gem. Now don't let some young man steal her away from you. [gagging] It's delicious. I just realized something. We use a lot of candles. Mmm. Do you have any idea what this is going to cost me? Uh-- Never mind. What's going on? Don't talk, just start blowing. [arguing] What's that? I'm not touching anything! I've had it. I'm not touching anything! What are you doing? Putting on my make-up. There must be 50 candles in here. Not counting the one she used to wax her legs. There's none left to take to the candlelight rally. What rally? - The one against injustice everywhere. - You mean like the face god gave you? I'm leaving. I cannot share a room with her anymore. Have a nice life. I want my own room. You can't have your own room, young lady, and-- Can't have a room-- can't have a horse-- I was supposed to get Maude's room. Since Maude's never marrying, I'll be in this room till we both grow old and die. You're already looking old. I can't believe how jealous you are! I'm not jealous of you! My life is going into the porcelain chamber pot. Don't despair, father. I'll always be here for you. Oh... Oh... Aah! The ball. The ball. We've got to get to that ball. [dog barking] Jeremy, look. It's my old cotillion dress. It makes me feel like I was 18. You can start feeling old again. We're not going. - What? - We can't afford it. We're broke. That's ridiculous. How can that be? Well, let's see. Now, here is a bill for a hat from Paris. I'm a Custis. Custises don't allow anything to touch their heads unless it's from France. I must remember to find a guillotine somewhere. It only cost ?100. Only ?100? Well, it was hurricane season. 37 sailors lost their lives bringing it across the ocean. It was a bargain. That's what's great about buying me a horse-- Nobody has to die. Not now, Abagail. You promised when I had chicken pox. Don't twist my words. I promised a chicken when you had the horse pox. I'm just the oppressed subject of an unfeeling tyrant. Me, too. Jeremy, we're just talking about a couple measly tickets. No. We're talking about five tickets, and we need dresses for the girls, and we have to take the stretch coach. I don't know if it's permeated your female brain yet, But have you any idea what this is going to cost? Oh, I'm sorry, darling. Did you say something after blah, blah, blah? Look, if you're so worried about the money, Why not borrow some from George? Ho...Ho ho ho. I'm not borrowing money from George Washington. He's your brother-in-law. He looks down on me. So? Everyone does. He--he keeps bringing up that old rumor. About you being a draft dodger during the French and Indian war? I told you I had to go to Canada on business. Of course you did, darling. I did, and I'm not crawling to George Washington. Ah, there you are, George. They told me I'd find you here. Am I interrupting anything? I always have time for you, Jeremy. You're like family. You ARE family of course. So, what brings you to Mount Vernon? Fact is, the inn isn't doing very well. I hoped you could help us out. Of course I can. Really? Have you tried putting those little mints on your guests' pillows at bedtime? I'm here to borrow money. You are? Oh, well... Come over here Jeremy, I want to show you something. What do you think? These-- are these the troops of the revolution? No, they're toys. See, this one's a drummer, and this one's an Indian fighter. See his little coonskin cap? Could we return to the money? Money? You're one of the richest men in the colonies. As Ben Franklin always says, "a fool and his money are soon parted." Then why is this taking so long? Eliza, I'm thinking of wearing this to the ball. Do you like it? You're going to the ball? I would've thought a social event for society's finest would be against your revolutionary principles. Hey, a party's a party. How did it go? Oh, terrific. Asked George for a loan, and he agreed... At 15% interest. Oh, so you didn't take the money. No, and don't ask me again. I wouldn't take Washington money for all the tea in Boston Harbor. They're insufferable, greedy, social-climbing snobs. You say that like it's... bad. Mother, which fabric would make the best gown for the ball? Ball? What are you talking about? Jeremy, I assumed you'd find some way to bungle it, so I saw my sister Martha in town shopping-- Her husband likes her to look nice-- I borrowed the money. Girls... Would you leave the room please? I need help selecting my gown. Eliza, dad's about to have a hissy fit. Now! Do I know dad? O.K. You've gone too far this time. Jeremy, you'd give up your spleen before you parted with a nickel. Only because it's an unnecessary organ. It's not the money. It's your sister. She is a gossip. Fiddlesticks. Martha promised she wouldn't say a word to anyone. Ex sir. Is it possible to be paid in advance from now on? I was talking to the dung sorter down at the fertilizer factory. He said, the word on the street is that you had the missis crawl to the Washingtons for money. Annabelle, did you hear that? Might I ask a second favor? Could you try to do a better job of managing these affairs? This makes me look bad in front of my friend the dung sorter. Sure. And you were talking about being paid in advance? Do you prefer bills or silver? I never say no to silver. Well, good. Don't come back until you're do. Are you satisfied now? Jeremy, what's it matter? We have the money for the ball. There's just one flaw in your thinking-- We're not going. We are. It's Maude's only chance of marrying Ben. But I don't want to. There you see-- what? I don't love him. I thought you did. I never did. If you'd asked me how I felt instead of planning my life, You would have known that. What have I done? Oh, don't blame yourself. Don't blame yourself. But, Jeremy-- All right. Blame yourself. You'll have to excuse me. I've got to talk to Maude. Fathers and daughters have a certain kind of relationship. Dad? Not now! You guys, move. Let's go. You know, this is unbelievable. Maybe we should just move into the stable. Why not? It's not like there's a horse in there or anything. I'm sorry, father. I shouldn't have spoken like that to mother. It's all right. She had it coming. Your mother should make more of an effort To find out how you feel, like I'm doing. So how do you feel? Terrible. Good. I'm glad we shared this time. Father, I'm sorry. I know you want me out of the house. No. I know you're afraid I'll never find a husband. No. I know my reading upsets you. Well, yes. I just don't want to marry someone I don't love. Then you shouldn't. Really? Really. This is your home. This is where you belong. We only want you to leave When you find that man you really love. Oh, father, thank you. Maude, no. Thank you. Thank you, because you reminded me, The only reason to marry... is love. I just wish somebody had given me that advice. You didn't marry mother out of love? Well--never say anything. Your mother, when she was a young girl, She hadn't quite lost her baby fat yet. The fact is, she was quite plump. Mother was plump? Let's say I never took her to the beach during whaling season. But she's so thin now. Potato famine of 1760. Then why did you marry her? She had a very large dowry... I mean, not as large as her, but pretty big. How do you think I paid for this inn? You're saying that you don't love mother? Of course I do. Look, I've been with your mother over 20 years, and we have three wonderful children. All right, we have our ups and downs like every modern couple, but we always manage to work through them. I think mother is a very lucky woman to have a man like you for a husband. So do I. Ha ha--whaling season. Hi I didn't know you were here, Annabelle. Hey... You're not mad about what I said to Maude, are you? Oh... You ARE mad. Whaling season? I don't know where those words came from. I...I-- You're scared. Yes, I am. It's the strangest feeling. I've never felt so... So weak and vulnerable before. I kind of like it. That's funny, because... I've never felt so strong and powerful before. I kind of like it, too. What are you going to do? I'm going to take you upstairs Before either one of us loses this feeling. I'm right behind you. Now we have to leave the house? All right. You can have the damn horse! (children laughing) I used to love this place. (children laughing and singing)
