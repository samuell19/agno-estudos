I believe in America. I believe in the people of America. Although this election didn't go our way, I believe we made a difference. And you can be sure we'll continue to fight. Maggie and I would like to thank every one of you who helped us get this far. This was never about me. This is about us. This is about you. This is about the future. Jesus Christ, Roger. He didn't lose because he used profanity. He lost because he was outspent three-to-one. I don't care. You're not sitting in the front, are you? Yeah, why not? Have a good trip, Mrs. Lambert. No, I know. I understand. Ellen, thank you. Where you headed? This old family lake house down in Georgia. Haven't been back in 20 years. It should be pretty romantic. Great. So the airport then? Yeah, unless you want to drive us to Georgia. I wasn't going to drive you to Georgia. Right. Oh, Yeah. Yep. Airport's fine. Honey, seriously. Media blackout. Well, now the child's parents are claiming he has hearing loss. Hi. We have a reservation under Lambert. Are you self-driving or fully automated? Self-driving. Look, I don't want to hear anything more about it. Really. That's why we came down south. Nobody knows me here... Hey! Jack Lambert! Fuck, yeah! You know, we could still go to Hawaii. Don't do that. You're going to love this. Small town, middle and nowhere, nobody to bother us. Well, if the house sells fast, we could do a short trip. Romantic weekend in Maui. This is going to be plenty romantic! The woods, the lake, the starry sky. Doesn't sound so bad. You'll see. Air's just different down here. It's humid, for sure. But it's just so full of life. And once we get to the lake house, everything just fades away. It's rustic. It hasn't changed at all. Come on. Has anyone been taking care of this place? For about a year since dad died. Are you sure your friend can handle the work? Oh yeah, Patrice is a pro. Pretty retro. It is so weird. I haven't been back here since I was a teenager. Please. You were never a teenager. I'm going to go check out the view. Yeah, you should. It's pretty amazing. Not sure about your dad's taste in decor, but you were right about the view. Oh. What's this? That is proof that, uh, I actually was a teenager once. Wow, look at that goofy smile. Yeah, that was before all the media training. Who's the girl? That's, uh, Elise. She's cute. Local girl who got away. Yeah. Wow. Dad really let this place go. Well, I guess we won't be running. What? You can clean this up with a machete. It'll be good for you. Yeah, I'll have Patrice look at it. Are you sure it's safe? Of course. My dad built it himself. It's solid. Oh! Are you OK? Yeah. Found a little spot that needs to fix. I'll have Patrice look at it. Are you sure you know what you're doing? Yeah, you just, uh, flip these switches here. Yay! I'll have Patrice look at it. You'll have Patrice look at it. Nice. Voila. What's wrong? What is this? Ravioli. I know, it's not part of your diet, but there's nothing else in the house. Hey, I used to love this stuff. My dad used to make it for me all the time. You're going to love it. Mm. Uh-uh. Oh my god. Either that's gone, or my tastes have changed. Oh no, honey. When something's good, it's always good. That looks terrible. Hey. I'm sorry. I'm just tired. I wanted everything to be perfect. That's why you're perfect. Come here. There is so much to choose from. Yeah. Just grab a cheddar or something. I'm going to get a bottle of wine. Oh! Damn it, sorry. I didn't see you. Elise? Yeah. Jack? Found a decent Camembert. What's with you in cans? There's fresh asparagus over there. Um, I... I like it in the can. You like it in the can? Do you even hear the things you say? And here's the little reading nook. Say hi to Jack. Hi, Jack. Hey, Louise. Louise thinks with some paint and a few repairs, she can unload this place fast. Oh. Well, hopefully to someone who appreciates it. Oh, that's got to be Patrice. Can you take me back to the kitchen? Uh, sure. We have to be quick. Holy shit. You look great, man. Hey, you know, you know. Keeping it tight. Right. What are you wearing, khakis? Relaxed fit, baby. Hey, listen, I gotta talk to you about something. Ooh, and this must be her, your beautiful wife! Hello, Patrice. Oh, hello. It is so good to finally meet you. Hey, I'm sorry I couldn't make it out to the wedding. You know, I was... No, don't worry about that. That was so long ago. You know, I was just getting my business up and running. Jack says you're doing well. Hey, you know, I wouldn't trust anything a politician says. Yeah, hey, hey. But yeah, I'm doing good. Definitely excited to get to work on this house. Lot of great memories here. It could use an update. Oh, no, no, no. I love it. How long has it been since you've seen each other? Um. 10 years? When I came up to New York. Yeah, that's right. 10 years. Hey, listen, I'd offer you a beer, but they're all warm. Hey, no worries. I'll just grab my gear. OK. I'll get us some wine. All right. Thanks, hon. Goddamn, you got you a hot one, huh? Yeah, yeah. Hey, listen... I saw Elise. Shit. So I'm not going crazy? She only been back a little while. Cause that bullshit company hired her daddy. I mean, they fly out there 10 years to the colony, and nothing's ready to go? I mean, most of them colonists they shipped off to another project. But couldn't unload everybody, so sent their asses back another 10 years in space. That's horrible. Sure. But you know, they're getting their settlement. Hell, I wouldn't mind getting paid for 20 years of sleeping. She hasn't changed at all. No, man. You know how that whole thing works. Speed of light. Hibernation. Nobody ages on that damn trip. I know, my dad helped develop the program. That's why they're not supposed to come back. It's weird. - Oh. Here we go! Can I get you anything else? Thank you, thank you. What do you think? Do you think we can get this place fixed up in a week or so? Uh, yeah, yeah. Bring a few guys on. We'll paint, fix what's broken. Yeah, but you don't want to do too much and kill the charm of this place. Nothing too new. Oh. Oh! There you go. Yeah, man. Perfect. Do you mind taking a look at the dock, too? Maggie, we just wanted to catch you up for a minute. Oh, no, no, no. No, it's no big deal. Let's go. - Thank you. I'll get a cheese plate going. Mm-hmm. "I'll get a cheese plate going." Shut up. She's been a good partner. Always a romantic. Hey, where's she living? Who? Oh, Elise? Yeah, well, she's staying out of her grandmother's house until the money... No. What? No, don't talk to her, man. I didn't even tell her you were coming. She knows I'm here. She saw me too. Look, look. She's only 18. It's not like that, man. I... I don't want to... I just... I just want to talk to her. Oh, and what would you say? I don't know. Exactly. You don't know. And it's not just the physical thing, OK? You see, to you, that's almost 20 years ago. But to her, it's only been a couple months. Coming? Yeah. Yeah. Watch these steps, too. Well that's one thing I need you to fix. Oh yeah? Yeah. Can we take a minute? I know, I just... I need a minute. Hey, what do you know about time dilation? What? Time dilation. You know, time passes differently at different speeds. Like the colony ships? Right. Let's go. Oh, god. People travel close to the speed of light, time slows down. Years are flying by down here. But for people on the ships, it's like nothing. That's why the ships aren't supposed to come back. If somebody did, they'd basically be time traveling. What are you getting at? Well, you know Elise? The girl from the photo? Your old girlfriend? Well, right, yeah. She's, uh, she's back. What are you talking about? Her dad got a job off-world, and she had to leave on one of the colony ships when we were, like, 17. But, uh, something went wrong, I guess, and she had to come back. So it's like the last 20 years for her didn't happen. Patrice told me. Wait a minute. Your old girlfriend came back from space. And she's still a teenager. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Wow. Honey, I had no idea. You thought that I'd be jealous? Oh, I don't know. Maybe. It's weird. It's amazing. I read an article all about it last year. I'd invite her over. Really? Yeah, of course. She came back from space! And she knew you back then. We must invite her over for dinner. OK. Seriously. You're blowing my mind right now. Come on, let's get your heart rate up. Stay here. I'll get some paper towels. You've got to stop doing this to yourself. You already have enough health problems. I'm fine. It's just... it's just food poisoning. Whatever. Coming! Hi, Elise. Hi. Uh, Patrice told me you were living here. Is everything OK? Sorry, is it... is it a bad time? Never thought I'd see you again. Me too. You dropped this at the store. What? Your asparagus. I bought it for you. I wasn't buying it, dummy. I work there. Oh. OK. All right. Thank you. Yeah, no, of course. You look so old. OK. Wow, thank you. I guess 20 years will do that. And you dress like a salesman. I am dressed like a... So listen. I wanted to invite you to dinner tomorrow night. I mean, we. We wanted to invite you to dinner... my wife and I. Maggie. Maggie? Yeah, I've been married five years now. Five years. I was hoping we could catch up, you know? You can bring your dad. I know he was never really fond of me, but I'd love to see him. So what do you say? We're staying at the lake house. Do you remember where it is? Yeah. Like it was yesterday. Right. Yeah. Um. So, tomorrow night? Say, 7:00? Sure. 7:00 could work. OK then. Great, I'll see you tomorrow night. Elise! Who's the fifth person? Patrice. Ah. He couldn't work today, but he can come to dinner? Well, I thought it'd be nice for Elise. Does it matter? - No. No, it's fine. Um, listen, I need you to hold still. I've got Roger. He's... No, no, no, I don't want to talk to him... Jacky-Jack! Boo! You handsome fuck. How are you, man? Hi, Roger. Ah, buddy, I miss you so much. You get my messages? Nope, we've been on a media blackout. What is that? Is that some sort of a new party drug? You gonna share with Uncle Roger? I'm kind of busy here, Roger. Yeah, I'll be quick. Good news. It turns out the kid? Not hearing loss, just a tumor. Dodged a bullet. Oh my god. Second piece of good news. Turns out Janet Chang had a stroke. How is that good news? Relax, she'll be fine. They got the nanobots in there. They're cleaning things out. And in a few months, she's be back to scowling at people. My point is, she's not going to be able to enter the governor's race. OK. Which means only Folger is left for the nomination. Everybody knows he's weak. Wait. We couldn't have asked for a better timing. You've got a very high profile right now. Folger is old news. Yeah, but everybody thinks I'm crazy. Forget about that, man. People liked your passion when they saw you yelling at that kid, OK? They just didn't know you well enough. What are you doing? There's a line. Where are you, Roger? Oh, dude, I'm at this new place called Bread Line. Doesn't that look awful? Yeah, my wife sent me here. You gotta wait in this line, and when you get to the front they give you bread. Anyway, listen to me. Jack, you keep doing your thing. You show people that you're a family man. Light that fire in your belly. He's right, Jack. And then you put a little fire in Maggie's belly. Am I right, Mags? Yeah, well, it's a big decision. It's a big decision. You got a little time. But listen, just a little time. Ideally, call me back tomorrow. OK? We'll figure this out. I swear to God, touch me. Go ahead, touch my fucking arm. That goes for all of you. I swear to God, it's a line. Governor? Why not? Just dinner, and then we're gone. Don't start, Dad. Hi, come on in, guys. Hi, Hank. You look just like your father. Great, thanks. Hi. I'm Maggie, Jack's wife. Nice to meet you. Hi, Elise. Hi. Hi. Come here. Oh my god, you're adorable. Thank you. May I? Sure. Thank you. Um, is it cool if we drink this? - Oh, yeah. - Gimme that. - Dear god please. - Let's do that right now. - I'll get it. I'll tell you something. When you watch things change, you barely even notice it happening. Skip ahead 20 years, and you really see how things are. Everything looks old. Everybody looks fat. I told your father he needed to keep things up better around here, but he never listened to anybody other than himself. Wouldn't argue with that. So you knew Jack's father well? Uh-uh. Actually, I met him because of these two. Oh. Jack never told me how you met. We met at the movies. Outside of the movies. Come on, Jack! You wrote a whole poem about it. A poem? It's disgustingly romantic. You don't want to hear about it. Oh, I do. I was with a friend of mine. My best friend Claire, actually. Do you know she's born again now? Oh yeah, yeah. She used to be a hardcore punk atheist. So weird. Anyway, we were at the ticket stand. And I only had pockets full of change. So I was counting out the coins, and a boy bumped into me. And then there were coins bouncing everywhere. But one of them landed on its side. It started rolling down the line, and it weaved left and right, around people, like it had a mind of its own. I mean, it even hopped over someone's foot and kept rolling. I was standing at the back of the line with Patrice, actually. Yeah, I saw the whole thing. We were... we were just goofing around, doing I don't know what. But all of a sudden, there was this commotion. And I looked down, and this coin's just heading straight toward me. It was weird because even back then, nobody used coins. So it just zigs and zags. It didn't make sense. And then it just came right to me. I stood up, and there she was. There you were. You were my hero. And then you stole from me. I paid for your movie. You kept my coin. I tried to give it back to you. Like that kind of asparagus. What? Yeah, it's nothing. When I bumped into Jack at the market, I... I dropped a can of asparagus, and he brought it back to me. Didn't realize I worked there, I guess. Disgusting, right? It is. How did you and Jack meet? We met at a bar. Oh Yeah, Jack was very drunk. I was very drunk. And we both wanted pizza. We had that in common right away. So we went out and we found pizza. And the next day, he called me and he didn't remember my name. I thought he was such a jerk. And then I gave him another chance, and he cleaned up quite nicely. We were married two years later. It wasn't very romantic, but relationships, they change and they grow. And it's not about how they start. It's about all the nights in those bad motels, and the takeout, and sitting in the church meetings, and the ballgames, and all of the long drives in the car going up and down the state listening to constituents. Trying to make a difference in their lives. That's what I cherish. That's what I cherish. Sorry. More wine? Yes. Elise. What was that trip like? I mean, not many people have gone that far and then come all the way back. I don't really remember. We were asleep. Didn't you dream? No. I don't think so. Nothing? I remember pieces. The heavy clang of the chamber door. The coolness against my skin. I remember my eyes getting really heavy, and then this feeling of sort of falling back like you get when you're just almost asleep. Except I couldn't reach out to catch myself or to wake up. I just kept falling back into what felt like an infinite nothingness. That sounds awful. It was peaceful. I imagine it's what a baby feels like in its mother's womb. Floating. You didn't feel all that time pass? When you're in a different state of consciousness, you don't feel time pass at all. I mean, it could have been a second or 100 years. When I finally opened my eyes and looked out the window, it was so big. Larger. What's that word? Vast. Vast. So many stars and colors and spirals and glowing clusters. I thought I'd feel small surrounded by all that darkness, but instead it was beautiful. And vast mystery all around you. But I wasn't afraid. I was filled with wonder. What about the colonies? It was a fucking disaster. For starters, they grossly oversold how fast things were moving. They were barely at 20%. Atmospheric complications, structural integrity issues, and don't even get me started on the government corruption. See, they couldn't take us all. So some genius decided to have a fucking lottery. A lottery? For what? To determine who would get to stay, Jack. But y'all got that... That big settlement though, right? That was a joke too. 20 years, gone. Just like that. And for what? I mean, all my friends are retired old men. My body's gone to shit from the Hibernation. And to top it all off, I don't have a fucking job. You know what's really funny is they haven't even given Elise here her money yet because... Now, get this... She just turned 18. She was born almost 40 years ago! Easy, Dad. I'm fine. Bureaucratic jackasses, all of them. You know something, Hank? When I was a Congressman, one of my key issues was protecting colonists from corporate malfeasance. Especially the children. Were you able to do something? We did help some kids. I wanted a stronger bill, but there was a lot of money on the other side. In the end, the legislation wasn't exactly what I wanted. But, well, we had to make a lot of compromises. You're more like your father than I thought. Big promises and delivers very little. Cheers. Hey, you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. Good. Weird scene, huh? Yeah. It's always strange when your wife and your girlfriend meet for the first time. Hey, why don't you bring Hank on to work with you here? Because he's an asshole. Come on, he knows the place. And he needs the work. Jack, you're both about the same age now. You don't have to impress him. As a favor to me. OK. But if he shows up to work drunk, I get to drink too. Where should I put this? Oh, uh, you can put them anywhere. I don't mind washing them. Oh, it's fine. In my kitchen at home, you just throw the dishes in the sink, and the next day you can pull them out of the cabinet. How does it do that? I don't really know. Is that a friendship bracelet? Yeah. My friend Claire made it for me. I used to wear those all the time. Are they back in style? I don't... I don't know. They were when I left. Oh, yeah. Guess that's when I was wearing them. Yeah, we were probably in high school around the same time, right? Probably. What a strange thought. Anyway, they should be in here helping us. Did you see Patrice hand me his plate? Don't get me wrong. I like him. But he's a little immature, right? Yes. Yeah. He's one of the few people who hasn't changed at all. I'm sure it must be somewhat overwhelming for you. All of this. It's OK. Have you thought about what you wanted to do with your life now that you're back? Not really. Travel, maybe. Here on Earth, I mean. Just go out and get lost. I've never really been anywhere. New Orleans once, with my mom. Well, you really shouldn't waste such a great opportunity. Most people don't get to see how everybody they know turned out. You can learn from their mistakes. Make all the right decisions. When I was your age, I knew exactly what I wanted. I knew the college I needed to get into, the internships that would help my resume, the law firm to launch my career. I had a plan, and I executed it. Sounds fun. If you want to amount to anything, you need to have a plan. What am I saying? I remember when I was your age, in one ear and out the other. I'm sure you'll figure it out. I'm sure I will. That is quite a dress. Thanks, I wasn't sure... But remember, with blush, less is more. Otherwise, it looks like you're trying too hard. I don't need your charity. Hank, come on. Please. Patrice could use the help. Because it worked out so well the last time a Lambert tried to help me. Jack, do you still paddle board? What? Your old gear is in the closet. You? Paddleboarding? Yeah, well, you know. It's been a while, but... I am learning all sorts of things about you. We should do it again. I don't think so. I can't even imagine it. You're, like, the least coordinated person I know. Hey. I'd like to see you in that wet suit again. So would I. Yeah, you would like to see it. I wear it like a second skin. It's beautiful. Then it's a plan. Tomorrow I have the day off. Oh. Sure, yeah. Sure. Why not? Yeah. Tomorrow. Cool. I'm not ovulating. That was nice. Really? Yeah. I think she's sweet. Why didn't you tell me you saw her in the grocery store? I thought I was going crazy. Just wanted to wait until I talked to Patrice. That must be really strange. She's obviously still in love with you. No, she's just a kid. When you're that age, you feel different one week to the next. You know what I mean. Honestly, I feel bad for her. She'll get over it. You're a good man. Oh, did you not want to? Do you? Well, I know you're not ovulating, but... I... we can. Oh, only if you want to. Oh, yeah, I got this. Looking amazing, honey! Ah, thank you. You're welcome. You must be so proud. Yeah. He's trying, anyway. Was he ever any good? Oh yeah. When he was 15, everybody thought he was the shit. Really? No. He's always been awful. He just owned all the stuff. We used to lay the equipment all out on the beach and pretend to be busy with all the pretty girls walked by. Did that ever work? Sometimes, but Jack met Elise, and I was left alone with all the pretty girls. Looks like nothing's changed. Woo-hoo-hoo. And you're still terrible at this. Hey. It's been a while. How long? Well, the last time was with you. What? Yeah. I haven't been back here in 20 years. What about your dad? Didn't you ever visit? No. Stopped talking to him a long time ago. Occasional messages, birthday card, whatever. But we kind of had a falling out. Because of what he did to us? There were other issues, but yeah. I was pretty furious. I asked him to help your dad with a job. The next thing I know, you're gone. Forever. Yeah, Hank didn't have to take it. I hate them both. Don't. Now that my dad's gone, I wish I hadn't cut him out. He was just doing the best he could. It seemed like the end of the world to me, you know. But the way he saw it, your family got an opportunity, and I was just a teenager. I'd get over you. And are you? Over me? I never imagined Jack as a governor. He's got a lot of work to get there, but you'll see it. Seems like a pretty big decision to make so quickly. Y'all just got here. Ah, it'll be good to get back out there, not dwell on the past. Keep moving forward until you get what you want. And that's what he wants? It's what we both want? It seemed to me like he wants a break. Wonder what they're talking about. Don't you have some work to do? That is not what I'm trying to say. It can't be both ways. Look, what happened was a meaningful... It was the most meaningful. It actually changed me in a lot of ways. And so I can still feel the impact of that summer. In that respect, I'm not over any of it at all. I can't believe you grew up to be this bullshit politician, Jack. The point is, I had to grow up. I got married. I had to move on. Yeah, so you got over me. Just say it. You complain about talking to a politician? I forgot what it's like talking to a teenager. How long did it take? What? How long? Honestly, Elise, I don't know. A year? I'm... OK, it was more than a year. Elise, come on! Seriously? Come up. It was way more than a year. I... I didn't mean it. Elise! Come up... Jesus Christ. You scared the shit out of me. How long was I underwater? What? How long was I underwater? I don't know. 30 seconds? 30 seconds. Good. Now you know. That's how long it took me to get over you. Here. I got it. Hey, I'm sorry. OK? Friends? Whatever. How do I look? Do I look good? Perfect on our end. OK, listen, this is what's called camera ready. This is what it looks like. I want you to soak it in. I'm wearing a shit ton of makeup, but I still look like I could kick your ass. This is what I need you to look like tomorrow. Uh, what are you talking about? What I'm talking about is your first interview as a candidate. You like that? Roger, I haven't made a decision yet. We're not going to actually declare. This is just to test the waters. You knew about this? Buddy, there was a last-minute cancellation. Karen Keeley really wanted to talk to you. That show does not ask twice. It's just such short notice. Well, so it was my last divorce, but that turned out to be a gift. You need to seize the moment. I want you to carpe scrotum. The kids love you right now. Right, Mags? People need to know you're still out there and not defeated. You don't have to declare yet. You can back out if you still want to. Yeah. I mean, if you want to back out, you still can. What this is, though, is maybe an opportunity to shore up that youth vote with a little focus on family values for the blue hairs. Maggie's got all the talking points. Listen to me, Jack. I know, I'm hilarious. But right now I'm being serious. I've done this for a decade. I've only lost once, and I'm not going to lose twice. That Senate thing? That was an appetizer. We're going to carpe scrotum. Carpe. Scrotum. I thought we were taking a time out. Why are we jumping back into this so quickly? It's what we have to do. Well, I thought I might go back into community organizing for a while. Maybe set up a nonprofit again. We're in debt from the campaign. We need to move this house. We need to pick our next steps carefully. Life doesn't stop because you want to take a break. Honey, after all we've worked for, this is a real second chance. What are you guys doing here? Bailing you out, man. We're going dancing. I can't. I gotta prep for this interview. See? I told you, Patrice. He's gonna get in trouble. I'm gonna get in trouble. All right, hold on. Just meet me on the side of the house. But be quiet. Shut up. Let's go. ID. It says you're 38. Yeah, don't remind me. In a couple of years, the big 4-0. Whatever. Go on in. This place hasn't changed much. What? This place hasn't changed much! This must bring back some memories, right? What? He said this place brings back memories! I don't remember it being so loud! What? I said, it's really loud! Jack Lambert? Yeah. It is Jack Lambert! Fuck yeah! This is the dude who screamed at kids! What? You're my hero, man. I hate kids! Hey, take a picture. Oh, no, we don't have to... OK. Is this your daughter? No, I... I'm his friend. Cool. We should all party. I'm Terry. That's my girl Celine. Yeah. I'm going to go ahead and get another drink. No, no, no, I got this one. Next round's on me. Great to meet you, Terry. Elise, do you wanna... Yeah. Uh, yeah! Two Jack and Cokes for us! You like to party, man? I think I used to babysit that guy. You used to what? Hey, you OK? I know this song. What about the drinks? Who cares! ...the summer, the light we grew up with. We'll forget the past, dear, and learn to live for this. We'll learn to live for this. Oh, oh. I can't believe you've never seen it! Stop being a jerk and show me. Oh. All right, but listen. Keep... just keep in mind this was, like, my... It was, like, my third stump speech of the day. Stump speech? Yeah, that's the technical term. Yeah! Are we gonna fight for our schools? Yeah! Are we gonna let them hear our voices? Yeah! Are we gonna win this race for our kids? Fuck yeah! I just got caught up in the moment. I don't know, I'm such an idiot. No, it's... it's great. I mean, that's totally you. That's the Jack I know. Jack! Hey, where you been, man? Oh man, this guy Terry is awesome. He... he has invited us to a party to watch some fireworks. Oh man, I don't know. Come on, Jack. Get caught in the moment. "Fuck yeah," right? All right. Fuck yeah. Let's go. - Yes! Ooh! Don't worry about that. There's gonna be some drunk-ass ants. I mean, if you want to get the job, you gotta do the bullshit. And that goes for everything, not just politics. You'll see. You sound like a bitter old man. There's a reason people get that way. I mean, if I knew then what I know now... Oh, I'm... I'm good, thank you. Oh, OK. All right. No thanks. Makes me dizzy. OK. Jack Lambert! Fuck yeah! Yep, thank you. Oh my god, why did you let me do that? I'm not the boss of you. That's your wife's job. Hey, words hurt. You know what you were telling me a few months ago? No, I do not. That's weird. You were saying, Elise, I never want to lie about who I am. I never said that. You did. You said your parents lied to each other about who they were, and that's why they were so miserable and split up. It was so clear to you. You know what? Actually, I do remember saying that. We were driving around. What do you want to do? I don't know, what do you want to do? I don't know. Forever, just all night. Driving, talking. Nothing to do. Now there's always something to do. You said to me... I remember you said, "You can try to be what other people want you to be. But if you lie about who you are, it won't matter." Well, you know, I was saying all that because I wanted to grow my hair long and my dad wouldn't let me. Yeah, you should have. Oh, are you kidding? As soon as I got to college, fwoomp. You must have looked pretty. Pretty? I looked gorgeous. I had this huge mane of hair that would flow in the wind as I rode my bike down the quad. It was great. And I'd sit in my dorm room at night in front of the mirror and brush it, like, 100 times. You see, I had the time to do those kind of things because when you look like you just escaped from medieval prison, you don't get a lot of dates, strangely enough. I'm sure you did just fine. Yeah. You know, the thing I said out on the lake about it taking only a year? Well, college was, uh, only. Guys. Oh, yes, pot. It's time. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1! What is that? Hm? Oh, right. This is how we do fireworks now. It's beautiful. It's actually an artificial meteor shower. There's a satellite up there that just shoots stuff into the atmosphere. Coolest part is that it's so quiet. Well, right now it isn't. Right, sorry. It is beautiful. You want to walk? Yeah. Yeah, let's do it. Forgot about that part where you stand up. It's weird. I've only been back for a little while, but I've managed to meet up with some of my old friends, and they all say the same things. You'll see. You'll learn. It's sad. Sad? Everyone looks tired, distracted. Like they had a dream and they lost it, even if they never really had one to lose. Well, Elise, people have children. They have responsibilities. It's not that. They just seem content to be disappointed. Well, as you get older, disappointments add up and you start to expect more of it. Yeah, but don't you wish you would have kept that excitement for life that you had when you were younger? It's easier to be excited when it's all in front of you. You should be even more passionate about life because there's less of it left. Just like the rest of them, you used to be cool. And now you're all boring and jaded. Elise, I don't mean to be mean, but you hardly know me now. I know you. I can see what's missing, anyway. When's the last time you really laughed? Tonight. And before that? I don't know, I laugh all the time. I love comedy. "I love comedy." What a stupid thing to say. Like that makes you unique. Like there are people running around all over. "Stop all this comedy. I don't like it one bit." Well, you'd be surprised about that. Stop. Stop talking to me like I'm this naive kid who doesn't know anything. Well, I'm a lot older than you know, Elise. Well, I don't care! Your age doesn't matter. I only care if you're you or not you. I didn't mean to upset you. I missed 20 years. I'll never get that time back. You're 18. You got your whole life ahead of you. That's not what I meant. Everybody talks about me like I'm this teenager trapped in time. But really, I feel like an old lady. How so? You'll probably think it's silly. No, I won't. Tell me. I don't know who the latest bands are. Most things are confusing. I mean, an artificial meteor shower? If you hadn't been here, I would have thought we were under attack. You'll learn. You'll catch up. You got to see things change, bit by bit. But for me, everything... poof. Totally different. I can't relate to people my age because we have nothing in common. I can't relate to people I used to know because they all think I'm a child. It's so confusing. Elise. And so much... So much looks the same. The town, the lake. My memories of everything are so vivid that even a storefront that's changed color or a street that's been renamed remind me that I'm out of place. Then there's my dad. He's sick. Really sick. And he's not taking care of himself. It's all on me. Nothing is like it was. I'm so sorry. It's not your fault you got older. I get it. It's just hard sometimes. I didn't realize how much everything would change, and how little I'd fit in. Not everything's changed. All these years, this has been my lucky coin. Never even told anybody about it. I just kept it close. Through everything. I love you. God. I can't. I can't do this. - I'm sorry. - No, no, no. I'm sorry. I'm drunk, and I'm stoned, and I'm... I'm way too old. I'm 18. Can't do this. I'm married. We can never do this. I... I just have to go. I have to go. Hey. Just going to bed. Hey, hey. Everything all right? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just tired. Goodnight, Dad. Night. I smell booze. Shh. I'm ovulating. I don't care. Stay on message. Thank you. And we're back with guest Jack Lambert, former Congressman and recent Senate candidate, known for his unique passion. Thank you for joining us, Congressman. Well, thank you, Karen, for putting that so delicately. But I think everyone knows what you're referring to. The swearing incident. A lot of folks are saying that's what cost you the election. It looked like it was all yours just the week before. Well, I think the election went the way it did for a number of reasons. But yes, it had an impact. And I'll just say now what I said then. What I did was inappropriate. And I'm truly sorry to those I offended. You're sorry? Absolutely. It was out of character for me, Karen. But I can assure you it came from a place of true passion for education and children's issues. See, my wife Maggie and I, like so many other people across our great state, are trying to start a family of our own right now. And we want to be sure we provide the Absolute best for every child's future. And that's what we wanted to talk about in this interview, but... Well, let me just show you this footage that's been making the rounds today. This is a video shot by an attendee of an out-of-control party just last night. Would you care to explain to our viewers what we're seeing here? Uh. Well, that's... We're on vacation. You don't seem too sorry about your behavior in that video, Mr. Lambert. And many are saying you now intend to run for governor. Is this the kind of loose cannon candidate we can expect? No, I haven't declared yet, and that's all out of context. So you admit you are considering a run in spite of these antics? Yes, Karen. I'm definitely considering a run for governor. But tell me something. Is this really news you're covering right now? Man on vacation goes to party? The kids in that video are having fun at my expense. I was having fun with them. So what? None of it has to do with my qualifications for office. Well, some say it does. And who are those people, Karen? The pundits who do the rounds on circus shows like this? Well, I don't think that's a fair assessment. But judging a person's worth on a snippet of video is fair? Well, if it's relevant... Let me lay it out there for you and the rest of the media so you can stop wasting time reporting on it. I'm a human being. I use bad language when I get worked up sometimes. Like most people, I can get caught up in the moment. Is that such a bad thing? Now, you asked me what kind of candidate you can expect. I say, expect a human being. If you want passionless perfection, do what Norway did and elect an artificial intelligence. OK. I believe in an America that excels because of the passion and humanity of its people and its representatives. When you start holding politicians to a standard so ridiculous that they become robots, people will go the other direction and elect the biggest idiot they can find. So I'm done lying about who I am. I think it's time for more honesty in this world. Thank you. Oh, and for the sake of honesty, I'm hung over his shit. Strong words from loose cannon candidate Jack Lambert. Looks like he went a little off script, and it all happened right here on Karen Keeley Live. What was that? I just... What happened to staying on message? All the work we've done, and you just throw it away like that? I didn't want to do this interview. You guys pushed me into it. Oh, I'm so sorry, Jack. I'm sorry you had to do something you didn't want to do. You sound like a fucking teenager. Maggie! What the hell was that video, huh? That's what you were doing last night while I was sleeping? Sneaking out with your girlfriend? It's not like that. You're so fucking cliche. Middle-age guy suddenly decides he needs to screw a girl half his age. Oh, do you feel like a big man now? Nothing happened. You were thinking about her, though. Last night. - What? No. I... I'm not an idiot, Jack. Long time ago, I asked you why you carry that stupid coin around. And you told me it was just a good luck charm. Do you have any idea what it was like to sit next to you at that dinner and hear her tell that story? To know that all these years... All these years. And to have to watch you make doe eyes at this child. Hey, hold on. It's not a normal situation. I know that I'm not everything you wanted. Maggie. I'm not spontaneous. I'm not... I'm not carefree. But I have built a life with you. I have tried so hard to be everything that you needed. And I know I push you sometimes. All I ever wanted was for you to love me. I do, Maggie. I do love you. I just... just needed to go out for a night. I just needed a break. From me. No. No. Just from everything. Get the fuck out of here. Maggie, come on. Please, Jack. Just go. Go. Oof. You look like shit, man. I'm telling you, a little rum and Coke in the morning always does the trick. Look at me. Let's get that drink now. Sure. Oh shit, man. You gonna cry? Don't you cry in my truck, Jack. You know how hard it is to get the smell of tears out of leather? Oh my god, it lives. I screwed up, man. Really screwed up. I know. I walked Elise home. Don't you say I didn't tell you, man. Should've left it alone. The past is behind you, you know? You try to relive it, it's never gonna work out. You're a real fucking instigator, you know that? If you feel that way, why did you come get me last night? Well, forgive me for wanting to spend some time with an old friend I never see anymore. I thought I had myself convinced, you know? That it was an infatuation. It's puppy love. I've grown up. I've changed. And I have changed. I've changed a lot. But I still love her, man. What the fuck. Hey, pull over for a second. It's the same bad movie. You wanna see it? Nah, something tells me it doesn't hold up to the original. Nothing ever does. Let's go get that drink. Yeah. You're kidding me. You're kidding me! Roger, I'm gonna have to call you back. Five minutes. Hello? Hi there. What can I do for you? Hi. I was just looking for my dad. Oh, that's who you're looking for? I thought that maybe he... I think I saw him out back. Come on, I'll walk you there. Oh, I don't want to bother you. No, I insist. You know, I didn't really get it at first, this place. More of a city girl. I love New York. Don't you love New York? I've never been. That's right, I forgot. Well, you should go. You should go somewhere, anyway. Travel. That's what you want to do, right? Yeah. Hm. Unfortunately, we are going to be traveling sooner than we thought. Things are heating up for Jack back home. I'm genuinely gonna miss this place. Whoever buys it is going to be very lucky. You're selling the house? Of course. That's why we're fixing it up. I just thought... To make it nice. Right. So it sells. I guess I thought Jack would have told you. You were with him last night, right? With Patrice. Lots of people. Thank you, by the way. He really needed to blow off some steam. Lord knows I can be kind of a drag. The last couple of years have been stressful. The campaign can really wear on our relationship. Last night, Jack was like a kid again. Couldn't get enough. I really needed it too. When are you trying for a baby, things can get a little mechanical. Who knows? Maybe last night was the night. So thank you for that. I'll leave you to it. Oh. This? It's much, much better. He can't tell you're trying at all. Have you seen Hank? Uh, Patrice let him go early. He wasn't looking too good. It'll all blow over, man You don't know Maggie. Even if we make up, in 15 years, she's going to make some crack. oh, an antique gumball machine. Have any coins? I love Maggie. I do. But if I'm being honest, it felt incredible in that interview today to say what I wanted to say. Maggie's... I always feel like she's looking at me imagining someone else. Oof. I mean, that's... that's kind of messed up, man. Look, I know... I know I've been giving you a hard time and all that. But look, if you want to be with Elise, just do it, man. Who cares you look like some creepy old dude? You can't worry about that shit. I'm not worried about that, thank you. When Elise and I were dating, she would write me these letters. Longhand. Ooh. Yeah, that's why I never told you about it, because you'd make fun of me. Well. She'd slip one in my pocket when we were together. I wasn't supposed to read it till I got home. Made saying goodbye easier. It was always about the stuff we were going to do next time we hung out, you know? Dumb stuff we were never going to do. Robbing banks. Joining a dance crew. Well, you might do that one. After she was gone, I took all the letters and I burned them. I had a little funeral in the backyard because there weren't going to be any more next times. And now, it's like I heard the beginning of a song, and it's been stuck in my head forever. And I... I just have to hear the rest of it or it'll never go away. Wait. Are you writing another damn poem right now? Sorry, I'm just... No, no, man. I get it, man. Hey, when I see you, it's like we pick up right where we left off. You know, like the last 20 years just went away for a bit. You know, I like that feeling. But if you commit to Elise? It's not picking up where you left off. You gotta blow everything up and start over. I mean, do you even like politics? I used to love it. We had fun. We were a team. And I really want to help people, I do. I'm good at it. But somewhere along the way, it just became more about playing a part and getting to the next level. Well, what I'm saying is, could you just walk away from it? I don't know. I built this whole life. And to see how Maggie looked at me today, I just... I can't be that person. We've gone through too much together. I can't blow it up. It would have been great to be with Elise, but I think we're both just going to have to accept the fact that that ship has literally sailed. I mean, you can still keep her in your life. I don't think that's going to be good for either of us. So this is the end of the song, right here. Don't make fun of me. I'm not! I mean, you're not happy right now, man. Then what's going to change, huh? Well, I'm going to apologize for what I did. OK. But if it's going to go any further, if that's even a possibility at this point, it has to be based on who I was in that interview. OK, well, you know, I hope you can pull that off. It's my marriage, man. I know. But you got to remember, all else fails, there's always the nuclear option. All right. Thanks, man. I will, uh, let you know. Hey, be careful driving home. Hi. Hi. Are you leaving? We need to talk. No, no, no. I gotta... I gotta say something first. Please. I was wrong. OK? To do what I did. The party, and... I know how hard you work for me. For us. And I was wrong. Thank you. But Jack... No... hold on. There's more. Did Elise come by today? She did. OK. I don't know what she said, but I just want to say that I am committed to fix this and get back in the game for us. I swear it. OK. OK? OK! Really? That's it? Jack. You're a hit. What? The interview. It went viral. The response is overwhelmingly positive. You just became the front runner. Are you kidding? No. Roger said they're talking about you as keynote next year, win or lose. This is huge. We've got to get back right away. Louise is going to oversee everything here, and Roger's booking us tickets for tomorrow. Wait. So you're not mad at me anymore? I was mad. But I've cooled off. I get it. You're only a human being, right? Gotta put that on a T-shirt. Hi. I'm leaving today. I just... I just wanted to say goodbye. Who's out there? Elise, I was wrong to do what I did. I got caught up and wasn't thinking. I know. You went home to her. I don't know what to say. I wish we'd been given a chance. What does that mean? It means, I wish your father hadn't decided to leave. And I wish my father hadn't made it happen. I wish you'd stayed, and we'd been given a chance. We have been given a chance. I came back. No, this... this was random. And crazy. This wasn't supposed to happen. I've had this whole life you don't know anything about it. So you'll have new things to tell me about when we talk all night. I don't love you. That's not true. And you don't love me. You love me from a moment in time 20 years ago. This is real, Jack. This is fate. I mean, you came back, and I came here. We've been given a second chance... No, no. The only chance we've been given is... is a chance to hurt each other again. And I'm sorry. I am sorry if I led you on. But this isn't fate. OK? There's no such thing. You're right, there isn't. I rigged the lottery. What? When we got to the colonies and they said they were going to send some of us back, I switched with someone who wanted to stay. And I knew you would be older. But I took the chance because nothing could stop me from coming back to you. I mean, if you hadn't been here, I would have found you wherever you were. But I see now that I was thinking like a child. So I guess I am growing up. Jack, thank you for that. Elise, don't... Don't. Hold... - Let me go. Hey, hey, hey! I... Hank, come on. I just want to talk to her. Slimy son of a... Dad! You've brought us nothing but grief! You stay the hell away from my daughter. I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I swear I didn't mean to mess things up. It's OK, Dad. It's OK. Louise, you have the keys? Yes. Safe travels. We'll be in touch. Thank you. Bye, Jack. Bye, Louise. Hey. You coming? Yeah. Listen, buddy, I really need you to hit the section on the subsidies for the colony companies, OK? OK, yeah. But what happened all the stuff I had in here about children's rights? That was the core of my speech! Listen, we are seriously in bed with these guys right now. This is not the time for that. We need to focus on the whole romantic space thing. Blue collar jobs. The fact that your dad was a pioneer in the industry. The same shit that we've been selling for the last six months. OK? Look, man, you nail this, the nomination's yours. Then we've got the governor's mansion. Maybe in a few years, we hear the pitter-patter of little feet in the White House. Still working on it, Roger. Coffee, Jack? No, no. Stains the teeth. Take I look at this. Isn't that adorable? So retro. You'll love as. Heck yeah! Call for you, Mrs. Lambert. That's hilarious, right? I got one too. Check it out. Oh, hey. Jack, buddy. How are you, man? Wow, are you anatomically correct? Heck yeah! - I - don't believe you dude. That's it. Show me. - Is everything OK? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I just... I need some air. Come here. Wow. There you are. I have great news. What's this? Louise found a buyer. Full asking price. All you have to do is sign. I can't do this. Oh. I'm sorry. Your head's in the speech. We can do this tomorrow. No. I mean, I can't do any of this. I don't understand. All of this is wrong. This isn't me. I don't want to sell the house. I don't want to make this speech. I don't want to hear the pitter-patter of feet in the White House. Oh my god. Roger was just kidding. He's always got his mind on the next thing. Fuck Roger. I never even met that guy in person. Is he even real? Help me out here, Jack. What's going on? I don't want to go back in there. OK. I get it. This is a big moment. You don't get it, Maggie. Then help me, Jack. Because there's a huge crowd in there waiting for you. I thought I wanted this. Not like this. And I should... I should have said something. I should have spoken up sooner. But ever since we got back, I've been thinking... About that girl? We had problems before Elise even came into the picture. We love each other, Maggie, but come on. We're not in love with each other is... I don't know when it happened. But whatever we had in the beginning is gone. It's just work now. This is just a business partnership. I know I'm not all things to you. Believe me, you're not all things to me either. Not by a long shot. Jack, when I was young, I had different expectations too. Why didn't you get what you wanted? We met at the right time. We fell in love. I understand that things change. Some things, yeah. But... well, this? It wouldn't be fair to you to keep pretending that I'm someone I'm not. This is it? Isn't it? Yes? Hi. I was, uh, looking for Elise. I'm sorry, there's no Elise here. Oh. She used to live here with her father, Hank. Oh, Hank. Yeah. Poor guy. He passed away a few months ago. Oh, I'm sorry, you didn't know? No, I didn't. OK. Well, uh, thank you. She moved on, man. Money finally came through and she moved out to New Orleans. I envy you, man. Got your own business. You're your own boss. You somehow manage to stay free of all the bullshit. Free? Shit. Come on, man, we all got problems. You know that. And if we're being honest, Jack, it's just like when we were young. You show up, make a big old mess, and then you just leave. You're right. I'm sorry. It's OK. It's what we expect from you. Are you gonna tell me where she is in New Orleans? I'll drive you there tomorrow. Oh, you don't have to do that, man. Thank you. Over there. Good luck. Thank you. Thank you. Hope to see you again. Hey! What are you doing here? I told you I'd stop by. Thanks. And I, uh, have something for you. What's this? Dear Elise. You probably don't want to see me again, but I hope you'll read these words and consider them carefully. If I could take back the things I said to you, I would. I was wrong about so much, and you were right. I haven't been honest about who I am for a long time. I wanted to run and tell you then to convince you to be with me again, but then I realized I was right about one thing. You need to live your life. You can only be young once. And it's not fair for me to show up and take that from you. So go out and live. Travel. Meet people. Discover yourself. You may think you already know who you are, but I learned it takes getting a little lost to really know for sure. I want you to know I've left it all behind. My wife, my career, all of it. Just tell them whatever you have to. Listen, Roger... no, no, no, I want to talk to you. Roger, I need you to pull some strings for me. You sure you want to do this? Positive. I mean, it's pretty crazy, man. Listen, just make sure she gets this. I'm going on a trip. I'm taking a chance, just like you did. I'm hoping that when something is true, it stays true forever. By the time you read this, I'll be boarding a colony ship. Five years out, five years back, frozen in time. Not as long as your trip, but it's all I could get. And probably as long as I can wait. I don't expect anything from you. You might find happiness elsewhere. Part of me hopes that you do. But I want you to know that I love you. I've loved you since I met you. I will always love you. If I'm lucky and you feel the same way 10 years from today, I'll be waiting for you at the theater where we met. Until then, you'll be in my dreams. Jack.
