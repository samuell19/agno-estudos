Tom, I reckon. Daryl, how are you, sir? Oh, you know what they say. About cold as a witch's tit in a brass bra, but I'm here, and I'm vertical, so it ain't too bad. Who's the young 'un? That there's Donald. He's my nephew. Tom's son. This is his first huntin' trip. Afternoon! Place looks exactly the same, Daryl. You gettin' much business these days? Oh, time to time. Yeah, well... Hell, I hardly been here. Been over in Waco with Mary's family. About all I got left now, so, you know, need to stay close. Much obliged. That will put you in a camper. About 25 yards the other side of that, uh, marker there. You brought propane and food, I'm assumin'. Don't worry, Daryl. I told 'em you weren't exactly Motel 6. Yeah, well, nearest town's about an hour's drive north. But they got a Walmart and there's another one. I think they got a Target. You still get whitetail out here? Well, to tell the truth, uh, I haven't seen much of anything. But it's always nice to get out of the city. - Brother-in-law? - Yeah. Bit of an asshole. Yup. But, uh, I try to take it easy on him. And the boy. His wife passed away last month. She's my sister. That's a damn shame, Frank. Sorry to hear that. With, uh, Donnie and his condition, we just... We're trying to work things out. To be honest, it's overwhelming. Funny in the head, ain't he? Slight. Gifted, for sure. Boy can draw like Van Gogh. But not all there. Yeah. Well, if y'all need anything, just follow that road right up there. 300 yards to my place, huh? Okay. Uh... Y'all be careful out here. Don't go gettin' yourself lost, all right? Propane ain't workin'. Motel 6. Donnie, grab your gear and bring it inside. Go on, now. So we wasted money on the propane. I thought he had hunters coming out here all the time. Should've went to Broken Bow, like I said. Well, forgive me for trying to stay close to home. Donnie's gotta be at school on Monday. Next time, I'll go alone. It'll be easier that way. I'm gonna see if I can fix the damn propane. Donnie, come over here and sit next to me. You know what we're doin' tomorrow, right? - Huntin'. - Huntin'. I already gave you the spiel about deer and how they're skittish and all. But I never spoke to you about snakes. And I didn't drive all the way out here for you to get end up bitten by one. Now, people say that snakes hibernate in the winter. Well, that's a load of horse shit. They're out here. They're scarce, but they're out here. And if you don't step where I step, you just might get bitten by one. You get bitten by one, I'm gonna have to drive you all the way back into town to see a doctor. Ain't no doctor out here. You understand? Why do we kill? It's just what we do. You know I got the propane workin'? You're late. It's damn near seven. We should've been gone already. You make us hot chocolate? He's gonna drink coffee. What? I packed his hot chocolate that he likes. You know... When I was younger and I went huntin' with my father, we drank coffee. He's gonna drink coffee. Donnie. Here. Swallow it down and let's go. They got a stock pond around here? Yep. So, you know your way around here pretty well? Well enough to get around. Stock pond's that way. It's really easy to find. Donnie. Well, if he's got a stock pond, I expect we'll find some deer around there. We aren't wearin' those. It's safe, Tom. Jesus, Tom. Donnie? You know, when I went huntin' as a kid, we didn't have to wear yellow vests. Donnie. Come over here. Go on, now. Just like at the gun range. Slide your hand forward. Right. Right. Steady. Deep breath. Set your sights on your target. Exhale. And slowly squeeze the trigger. Go on, now. Donnie, you don't wanna do it, you don't have to. You shut up. Donnie. Take the shot. Give me that fuckin'... Well... That's that. Come on. Thought you said you missed. I thought I did. Tom? Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. God. Hey, he's still alive. I already checked. Shot in the gut, though. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Daryl told me we were the only ones huntin' out here. Look at him. He ain't no hunter. God help him. God damn it, Tom, what're you doin'? We ain't helpin' him until we know who he is. The man's been shot! He's dyin', for god's sake. He's shot in the gut. Why? Who shot him? Why the hell is he even out here? We gotta be smart, Frank. I'm so sorry. Please. Who are ya? - What happened? - Please. Please, I... I can't feel my feet. What the hell are you doin'? Man's been out here god knows how long. We gotta get him warm. Who shot you? If you don't answer me, I swear to god. Jesse. The son of a bitch. I'm fuckin' dyin'! All right. I'm gonna see if you got a bullet in your gut. You try one god damn thing, and I'll put another bullet in ya. Just, just do it. Just do it. Bite down on this. Okay, are you ready? I need a fire. Now. Hey. I'm a crackerjack shot with this. You pull out anything other than a blanket... Why are you doing this? I'm looking for a friend. I'm pretty sure he wandered into your property. I got a lot of property. Yeah, I know. I spent the night walkin' in circles, freezin' my ass off. I'm assuming that, uh, he either bled out, or he's gonna make his way over here, looking for help. But until then, you are I are gonna get comfy. What's your name, old man? I'm Jesse. I'd rather know as little as possible about you, mister. Just being honest. I want you to find your friend. And then I want you to get off my property, as soon as possible. Oh. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm afraid it's not gonna go that way, mister. Hey. Just bein' honest. Winks. Name's Daryl Winks. Yeah. My father used to read that shit. Are you kiddin' me? Louis L'Amour is a legend in this neck of the woods. Best western writer this side of the moon. Baloney. So you know how to get to Daryl's from here? No. I do from the camper, but, out here, at night? I just walk in circles. I thought you said you'd been out here huntin' before? Well, excuse me for being a little out of sorts. I didn't expect to come across a man shot to hell. All right, I guess we'll wait till morning. Then we head out to the camper. Well, how're we gonna get him there? He can't walk. Did I say anything about taking him with us? We can't just leave him out here. We get to the camper, then we can go to Daryl's, tell him where's he at, he'll call the sheriff. Done. He's gonna either die from the bullet wound or freeze to death. What was that? Get your gun, Frank. Shh. Probably just a critter. Why don't you relax? No, I'm all right. Poor kid. His first huntin' trip and we don't even get to hunt. At least he saw a deer. More than my first time. Remember Virginia? Planned that trip for months. I quit my job 'cause they wouldn't let me off for it. Then we're on the interstate and the god damn truck dies. Ashley was so pissed at you. I could never figure out why. My sister was an odd one, that's for sure. Yeah, that was, what? 10 years ago? Oh, no, wait. Donnie wasn't even born yet. It must've been more like 16 or something. Frank. Yeah? Try to rest. It was oil. What? She was mad at me because I forgot to change the oil. That's why the truck died. That's why we missed that trip. I miss her. And I don't feel bad for tellin' you, I think you could've done better while she was alive. You just hunted. Ate, slept. She hated you. So did I. That boy over there needed you more than anyone, especially with his condition. I worked, Frank. That's what a man does in this world. He provides for his family. I did what was demanded of me. And you? You don't even have a family, so... You don't even know what you're talkin' about. Yeah. Yeah. Yep, yep, yep. Just enough providin'. You know, you walk around thinkin' you're a fuckin' cowboy. Well, I got news for you. You ain't no cowboy. You work in a factory. You drive Ashley's Mazda when you're not huntin'. It's the 90s. Wake the fuck up. You might as well be dead to Donnie, too, 'cause you sure as hell ain't here no more. I know you hate her for it. I know it's a sin, the way she did it. I reckon I'll never know why she did it. But I have my suspicions. So the way I look at it, it's your fault she's dead. Not Donnie's. If that's what you've been thinking, you're wrong. It's your fault. Crap. Where you goin', old man? Well, if you want me to help you find your friend tomorrow I'm gonna need my sleep tonight. Mm-mm. Sit. You wanna help me find my friend? That's awfully nice of you. You know what I'm gonna do to him, when I find him, don't you? I'm gonna put him down like a dog. That's if he's alive. You wanna be there when I do it? You ever seen a man die? Hey, when's the wife gonna come and pick you up? Why do you ask? Well, I need wheels. I gotta get off this shit-smelling property. Hm? No bother for me at all. To put you down. Tomorrow afternoon. Good. Good. You and I can stay warm until then. Maybe we can be best friends when this is all said and done. Oh, good. At least Jesse cracked his fuckin' skull. Oh! Aww, shit. I don't suppose one of you good Samaritans could hand me my property there, would you? Holy shit, where are my manners? My name's Davey. That backpack that you've got there is, um... Well, that's mine. And it sure would be nice if you could just hand it back over here. Why you got all this money? So, that... That right there... That is what you boys might call a fresh start. See... See, me and my little brother, we uh, we lookin' to relocate. And that is all of our savings. Looks like you robbed a bank, if you ask me. Well, I didn't ask you. I'm, I'm sorry. I don't mean to be so agitated. I don't know if you fellas have ever been shot and had to sleep out in the freezing cold for two days, but... I am in a bad way and I really need your help. We'll help you just as soon as you stop lyin'. That's fair. I've done enough sinnin' for one lifetime. That money is from a bank. See, me and my little brother, we just lookin' to start fresh. You know, we're trying to make our way to the Philippines. See that money right there? That is God's money. It's true. I'm lookin' to start a church. So's I can get out there and lead all them Filipinos to God's loving light. Did you know... Did you know that in some parts, they don't even have a religion. It's, um, it's like their minds are darkened to it. A bank-robbin' Christian in the middle of butt-fuck Texas. This is the worst huntin' trip I've ever been on. Look, why don't I... Say we do this, why don't you make it worth your while? All right? Hey, what's done is done. The law don't know we're out here. You boys could help yourself to a little of that. And then maybe help me and the rest of my money get out of these woods. And then me and my brother, we'll keep you safe. I don't make it a habit of helping criminals, mister. Or savin' 'em, for that matter. Well, maybe it's not so much you savin' me as it is me savin' you. See... While I'm here tryin' to set myself on the straight and narrow, and do things according to God's plan, my little brother, he's... Well, he's not quite so Christian. Oh. They, they broke the mold when they made little Rickey. Somethin' else. The way he cuts up a person. It's like a artist with a brush. I tried to save him from his evil ways, but he's an uphill battle. God's love just can't seem to find his cold, dark heart. So... If you fellas can find a way to get me and my money out of these woods, I will do my best to keep him off of you. Tom. Let's just leave. We can get to the camper from here and then get to Daryl's and call the cops, get 'em here. Tom? Is it, is it Tom? Tom, listen, you really should think this through hard. I mean, real hard. You know, you could do the right thing. You boys have a chance to save me and walk outta here 10 or I'd say even $15,000 richer than you was when you came in. And that's a damn sight better than an old buck, ain't it? If we take him to Daryl's, him and his brother will try to kill us. So, we do what I said. We get ourselves to Daryl's, without him. I couldn't live with that. He could get away with what he's done. His brother could get here and find the money and... So? No, this is none of your business. Being a father is. Think about Donnie. We need to get as far away from here as possible. Excuse me, boys. What is the plan here? Who's Jesse? What's that? Last night you said someone by the name of Jesse shot you. That's right. That is one more reason why you fellas need to find a way to get me outta here. Jesse is a double-crossin' son of a bitch. He's out here lookin' for me, too. Between him and Rickey, you boys have got yourself into a pickle. But I... I can, I can help you. I wanna he... Fellas. I don't have much longer out here, I feel. Frank, grab a gun. This is how it is. You're a big ol' boy. Too big for us to carry ya. So, you're gonna stay right here. That'll tide you over till we're back with the sheriff. Please don't leave me! Don't. Don't take my money. You poor sons of bitches! Rickey is comin'! He will find you! And he will kill all of you! Don't leave me! "Riches do not profit in the day of wrath where righteousness preserves us from death." Don't leave! God. May my faith keep me alive. May my faith keep me alive. Sleep in? God damn. Tastes like shit. God damn it. How far a walk is it to the next property? Well, if you're going to Jeremiah's, it's, uh... Maybe 25 minutes to the north. Steve's land's a good hour from here on foot, if you're going to his house, that is. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Awfully looking forward to meeting the missus. She's pretty. For an old lady, you know. You ain't going anywhere near her. Is that so? Yeah. I'll get the truck from her. I don't even want her knowing you're here. Tell me somethin'. Why is it you do the things you do? Is it upbringing? Are you angry with somebody? There's always a reason why you people turn so damn rotten. Not really. I just like money. I don't like people. So, robbin' shit, it's a perfect career. Hey, hey, hey! Take it easy. I don't just read westerns. I like readin' this book from time to time. It seems to set me straight. When I was a young man, newly married to my wife, I had the wandering eye. Not proud of it. I worked in the oil industry and traveled quite a bit. Faced temptation everywhere I went. Mm. Mm-hm, yeah. I can see that with your rugged good looks and everything. And one day, I didn't like who I was. I didn't like what I'd become. So, I opened this book and started readin' it. And now you're the perfect gentleman. No one is without sin. No one is perfect. But the verse that really got me... The one that dug right in there and changed me was, uh, Ephesians 4:32. Let all bitterness, wrath and anger, and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. Be kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God and Christ has forgiven us. That's the New Testament, right? Yep. Well, I grew up with the Old Testament. Yeah, I bet. I ain't gonna help you find that man. You got anger in you, son, and I see you struggling with who you are. You don't have to be this way. Mr. Preacher... I think I'll take that tea instead. Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet. Shit. Maybe it's Daryl. Whoever's in there, you slowly come on out! We got two rifles aimed right at that door! All right! Comin' on out! Don't shoot! I, uh, reckon this be your camper? Uh, oh, well, we were just renting it for the weekend. We're actually just out here huntin'. Yeah, huntin' up a lot of deer, I expect. I haven't hunt me a deer in a good long while. Why are you in our camper? Oh, I'm awfully sorry about that. Mighty rude of me, I guess. See, I'm just looking for my brother and friend of his. I thought maybe they wound up here. This is private property. Why would they be out here? Oh, well, just down yonder down the road on the main road across from the plains, they got themselves in an accident. Right outside this property. Is that right? Yes, sir. Vehicular. That is, he ran his damn car right into a tree. And I was awfully lucky to stumble up on that car. I'm just tryin' to track them down. I'm awfully worried about their wellbein'. Oh, hey! Where's my manners? The name's Rickey. And, uh, you gents are? I think it's best you look elsewhere for your brother and your friend. So you just take your ass back to the main road. We haven't seen 'em, so, I'm sorry, we can't help you. We're actually just leavin'. You, sir. You need to learn some god damn manners. See, I ain't said nothin' deserve that kinda talk. And I'm bein' just about as kosher as I can be. Kosher? Is that what you call it when you go through other people's things? Now you hold it right there. You need to put your hands up, right now. Hey! How you doin', son? Hey, you look a little bit scared. Y'all not to be. Nothin' to be worried about. See, I'm just lookin' for two fellas. Now, one of 'em, he's a big Sasquatch son of a bitch, and the other one, ah, he's this ratty, heavy metal lookin' motherfucker. Now, you wouldn't happen to have seem him, would you, little man? Huh? Hey! You stop talkin' to him. I'm gonna tell you right now. You pull that gun out, real slow, and you place it on the ground. Now, this pistol, my daddy gave me this here pistol. You're out of your god damn mind, you think I'm gonna give it to ya. I don't want it. I just don't want you to have it right now. So, slowly, pull it out, put it in the dirt. Seems to me like, uh, we've just gotten off on the wrong foot here, boys. All right? See, I'm just looking for my brother. And his car was in a bad way when I come up on it. I just wanna make sure that he's still alive. I'm gonna go on this way, and I'll leave you boys to your huntin'. And I'm taking my pistol with me. On account of wild creatures and such. I might just need it to protect myself. You boys have a good day now. Whoa, now. Now, that backpack. That looks an awful lot like my brother's. Well, it ain't. He's had that since we was in high school. Yeah, we used to sneak beers into the cafeteria with it. So I'm pretty god damn sure it is. Now, if you just stumbled on it, that's fine! Give it on over here, I'll take it from you, be on my way, go reunite that with my brother, 'cause he is awfully fond of it. We ain't givin' it to ya, so you just keep on walkin'. Well, now I'm guessing that you took a look at what's inside. You know what's inside that there bag there, sneaky peaky? Huh? No! Oh, yeah. I think so. Hey, you point that gun at me! No. I think I like it pointed right where it is. Sir? Please don't. You boys think this is the O.K. Corral? Well, let's make it the god damn O.K. Corral. Now, I don't know how many times you boys have pointed guns at people, but I know for me this makes it a good two-dozen. And sure, some of those times was me just fuckin' around, but most of the time, I had a reason. And I can tell you that in all my years of pointin' guns at people, you don't hesitate to pull the trigger! Fuck! Oh, you motherfucker. Get to the truck! Keys! Shit. They're in the camper! Get to Daryl's! I'll keep him pinned down! You tell me where my brother's at! You cowpoke motherfucker! Shit! Fuck me. Shot my motherfuckin' foot! Oh, he's a dead motherfucker now. Fuck! Motherfucker! Shit. Fuck. Fuck. Oh, thank god. Oh, shit. Hey, come here. Okay, you're okay. What happened? He ran off that way, but I expect he'll be back. Couldn't find the damn keys to the truck, though. That doesn't matter. Daryl's just 10 minutes up this road. We get there and get safe. We stay on this road, we're out in the open, - and I don't like that. - If we run, we can make it. The way I see it, there are two men looking for this backpack. That psychopath back there, and that other guy that shot Davey. Jesse. So even if we make it back to the house and call the authorities, it's gonna take 'em at least an hour for someone to get out here. Your point? My point is I don't like havin' this backpack on us. Because if they find us, they're gonna kill us to get it. But... If we hide it and they don't know where it is and we do, I don't think they're gonna touch us. Okay, well, what if they touch us to find out? It seems like he's the kind of guy who would do that. Yeah, I suppose you're right. But I'd rather have some kind of advantage than none at all. First thing we need to do is get off this road. If we head in the same direction, we're gonna run into that house, right? Hey! You gotta get your shit together. We are down in this and you need to get out of it. You gotta be smart. You hear me? Yeah, I hear you. Whoa! Davey! Davey, shout if you can hear me! Davey! Where the fuck are you, boy? Daryl? Daryl! Stay here. Don't come in here. Frank, Donnie, I told you to stay... Good afternoon, fellas. Was about to have me some lunch. Why don't you put your guns down and you can join me? I'm a crackerjack shot with this. Yeah. Attaboy. Look what they done to you, big brother. These motherfuckers. I don't know what to do now, Davey. What do I do now, Davey? Fuck! God! Damn! You're goin' to meet Momma now. You gotta look your best. There you go. You go with God. Just like you intended, big brother. This is a sign from you, ain't it? You want me to go find our money, don't you? I'm gonna get our money, and I will do with it what you wanted. Yeah. I want you to hold onto that for me. I'll be back with the rest of it. Oh, I promise. Mm? Suit yourself. You guys hunting? Where's Daryl? Oh. Daryl. Well... He was a persnickety son of a bitch. A funny one. But a tad self-righteous to boot, so... Jesus. Yeah, he mentioned him a lot. Yeah. That's all he ever talked about over breakfast. I figured since he loved him so much, I'd let him see him, sooner or later. Your nose. Don't talk to him, Donnie. No, go ahead, son. Oh, well. A friend of mine did this. No, actually... It was a car, but he caused it. That's a lie. I shot him in the gut. We wreck. So I guess I caused it. Broke my own damn nose. Damn good kicker. Well, it's gettin' late. I was waiting for a ride, but, you lovely gentlemen showed up, so I'll just take yours. So how about handing over that key? We have the money. Money? What the fuck you know about money? I know you touch one hair on his head, you ain't ever gonna see it. So I see you've met my ex-partner. Is he dead yet? Don't know. We left him out there. But we got that money. And we know there's some other fella out there, lookin' for it, some guy by the name of Rickey. Rickey? He's here? You met him? Yeah. Blew the bottom of his god damn ear off. Frank here shot him in the foot. But I know he's lookin' for us. And he's lookin' for you, too. Where's the fuckin' money? We hid it. You're gonna tell me where that money's at, or you're gonna be seeing Jesus before sunset, just like old Daryl there. Tell this one to shut the fuck up! We buried... Keep your mouth shut, Frank. We ain't tellin' you a god damn thing. And there's a lot of land out here to bury things. And if you hurt any one of us, I swear to god, you will never be touching that money. Well... That Rickey, that son of a bitch. What a character. I mean, seeing him work is like watching- - An artist with a brush. Like me. Quiet down, Donnie. Fuck me. I'll make you deal. You let these two go, I'll take you to the money right now. We will hike out there, dig it up. When we get back, I'll give you the keys to the truck and you can just drive off into the sunset. You're too sweet. It's the only deal I'm gonna make. Well... I'm about to put a bullet in your son's leg. Let it bleed for a while. I'll leave him and your boy. But they don't leave this house till we get back. Got me? Hey. That's a nice jacket. Hey, let's go. I'll come back to get ya. You boys sit tight. Hey, you know it ain't gonna go down the way you told your boy, right? I mean, that's sweet an' all, givin' the little guy somethin' to hope for. But I know Rickey's gonna stumble upon that house and he's gonna find them. You seem to be pretty scared of this man. I ain't scared of nobody. I'm just smart. I swatted at the hornets nest and there's hell to pay. Doesn't sound too smart. You taking money from a crazy man like that. Rickey don't give a shit about money. Now, killing his brother. That's a whole different story. Davey goin' all soft, turning into a religious nut. Can't work with people like that. Time to split up. So he was really gonna start a church? Yeah. It's all he kept talkin' about. That's why I took the money. I don't wanna see it go to waste like that. Supposed to be goin' to Brownsville to meet his crazy-ass brother. That's why I did what I had to do with that car. You know, Davey's the only one that could put a leash on that boy, and now he's off it. And I ain't stickin' around to see what happens. Come on, let's go. Come on. I'm so sorry about all this, Donnie. I'm sorry about your mom. I'm sorry about your dad. He just doesn't know how to deal with all of it. This whole god damn huntin' trip was my idea. I'm so tired, Donnie. I'm tired of all of it. I just... Nothin' about this is fair. And I just... You don't deserve any of this. I love you, Uncle Frank. You're somethin' else, kiddo. You really are. You know that? I'm gonna get us loose. I'm gonna get us outta here. If I just rub these ropes. He didn't know how to tie a knot. Hello? Help! Help us! Oh, it must be Christmas. Holy shit. Now which one of you motherfuckers killed my brother? Was it that cowpoke who shot my ear, huh? Where's he at? No, no, no, he's not here! No, but it wasn't him. No, no, no, no! Your brother, he was like that when we found him. It was an accident. We didn't mean to shoot you. Please don't, please, please. We didn't mean to shoot you. It's all right. Shh. It's all right. It's okay. It's gonna be all right. Well, why don't you, uh... Why don't you tell me what happened? - Okay, well... - Yeah. We got here to call- - Call? Call the sheriff? The sheriff, yeah. Oh, I figured that. That's awfully nice of you. Now, was this, um, after you took my money and you left my brother to die? No, no, no, no. We didn't leave him. We were coming here to help him. We were gonna call the sheriff so he could help him. - Oh! - He was too- - Ain't that a story. - No, no, no, no! - Yeah, ain't that story. - We were coming- - Now, tell me! Why didn't you just take him with you? I mean, he was in need of help. Fuck sake, he took a bullet in the motherfucking gut! I know! No, we... We were coming here because we were gonna get help for him, because he was too heavy, we couldn't carry him. We were gonna go back to get him, and then that's when we got here and Jesse was here and he, he was, uh... He's the one who shot him and he was looking for the money. Jesse. You gave him my money, didn't you? No. Our motherfucking money! No, no, no, no, no! No! No, we didn't! We didn't give it to him! No! - Where's my money? - We buried it. We hid it, we hid it. Please stop. Shh, shh! What did you just say, you did what? - We hid the money, we hid- - Yeah? Yeah, we buried it. Well, hey, that's good! That's good news, buddy. That's all good. You just, you tell me where you hid it, and I'll leave you boys to your little bonding time here. Okay, um, Tom hid it. I don't know where he... I was there, but I didn't see where he hid it. - You don't know? - Yeah, he did it, I... - Tom did, Tom... - Shh, shh. You fuckin' with me? I just saw the same damn tree 10 times! You walking me in circles, wasting my time? - Huh? - No, no. All the trees out here look alike. Listen. The pond's right up over that ridge. I promise you it's like two, three minutes, tops. I promise. Hey. That's a nice hat. ♪ The sun is shining bright today ♪ ♪ I'm feelin' all right today ♪ ♪ The birds are singin' a tune, hooray ♪ ♪ Oh, what a glorious day ♪ - No, no, no, no! - Come on, now. There you... - You like that? - No. Yeah. This kinda reminds me of my first time. And now you're gonna tell if you're fibbin' or not. What do you think, boy? Huh? Think this old boy here is fibbin'? Gee, uh, I don't know. I mean, I got your pecker in my hand. I'm about to cut it off. You'd think any old boy'd be sayin' somethin' but you ain't! That kinda gets me thinkin'. Maybe you don't know where my money is. Or maybe you do. And you just want me to... No! Oh, I'm just fuckin' with you, old boy. It's all right. Hey. I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not, all right? You done good. Now, what about you? You, uh... You some kind of retard or somethin', boy? What's your deal? He's autistic. He's all what? Autism. So, yeah. So, he's a retard, then. That's why he won't look at me and he's all... He has sensory issues. It makes him feel safe to avoid eye contact. Oh. Oh, is that right? I want you to look at me, boy. Hey. Hey. You get your god damn eyes on me, boy! - I said look at me! - Stop it! You look at me right now. There you go. - Stop it! - Hey, it's all right! I'm just trying to help the boy! Hell, I was a retard when I was a kid! I ain't no more, though. That's not how it works. You don't just outgrow it. I never said I grew outta nothin'. No, you see, let me tell you a story. See, I used to be stupid. Oh, one stupid motherfucker. Then I got my ass beat. Then after that, well, I weren't retarded no more. You hear me, boy? All right! Ah! I think that we should all go for a little walk. Oh-wee! Hey, uh, how long ago did you say they left? About 10 minutes or so? All right, then. Just grab me a can and kick back the bubbly pop. God damn, Jesse. You outdone yourself this time. Go. We gotta get outta here. You're gonna be okay. You're all right. Here we go. No, no, no! Donnie, Donnie, Donnie! No! No, don't. That your daddy? I'm awfully sorry about the way that had to work out. He left me no choice. I gave him the twist to end it fast like, so no sufferin'. You know... Most people think that an unsavory fella like myself is the product of bad parenting. That ain't so. Naw, Davey and me, we had model citizens for parents. Yeah, Momma and Daddy, they were just so... We just... We just didn't quite turn out the same as them. Davey. He tried to be like Daddy, but uh, oh, it just weren't in the cards. Mm-mm. Uncle Frank, wake up. Uncle? Well, now. That's another story altogether. Our uncle was a mean son of a bitch. I never did like him. I hated that motherfucker. Well, if this here's your uncle, that must mean that that cowpoke who shot off my ear is your daddy. I want my book. I want my book. I want my book, I want my book, I want my book! I want my book! I want my book! Uncle Frank! Wake up! I want my book, I want my book, I want my book. I want my book. Uncle Frank, wake up! Hey, hey. Sit your ass down and shh. How about we go find that daddy of yours? Yeah? That tire. It's buried underneath it. Okay. Well... Get diggin'. Come on. All right, come on. Which way? I'm embarrassed in letting a retard show me the way. - I'm not a retard. - Oh, excuse me. Come on, you slow ass. Move your ass, boy! The fuck are you doin'? Snake. Snakes. What? Well, maybe in the summer. There ain't no snakes out here in this cold. Hell. My dad said they're here. They're scarce but they're here. Well, that's 'cause your dumb shit daddy don't know what he's talkin' about, boy. Now, let's go to the pond. Come on. Woo! Here we go! Game on, boy! I'm comin', buddy! I got you. Motherfucker. I want you to know, the only reason I ain't gut you yet is 'cause I want your daddy to see you one last time. I just think that'd be the kosher thing to do, don't ya? You're fuckin' fast, boy. You run track or some shit? Come on, let's go. Get up. Hey! This way, dumb shit. Come on. Oh-wee! That's a lotta money. Well, well, well, my friend. That's that. Guess so. Hey. Now, you got the high ground. Stay way the fuck back. You got the high ground, you can see him comin'. You take that rifle right there, and you could take him out, right now. No need to hurt anybody else, you have the money, and then you can just let us go. Well... You want the good news or the bad news? The good news is your son's with him. The bad news, looks like the uncle didn't make it. Hey, uh, you and your daddy go huntin' much? Pretty dangerous goin' huntin' with the likes of you. I mean, run off, shoot your daddy in the head or some shit. Isn't that what people like you do, huh? You ever get spells? You know, like you wanna hurt someone? Huh? Yeah. I reckon we ain't so different, you and I. I get spells. I get 'em bad. Hey, don't look now. Gotta drain the main vein. Woo! Always said I was a crackerjack shot. And I... Can't usually hit the broad side of a barn. Hey! Get back, you little fuck! Get your ass back here, boy! Shit! God damn, get out here. Where are you, you son of a bitch? Oh, shit! Donnie! Donnie! Where are you? Bingo. Come on out, cowpoke! You throw your rifle over that ridge and I'll let your boy go! I gutted his uncle back at the house, you know. Comes easy to a fella like me. Killin'. Makes no difference what age they are! Donnie here. What, he's 16? Don't matter! That rifle don't end up down here, Donnie ain't gonna see 17. I ain't fuckin' with you, cowpoke! Where's my... Where's my son? Oh, he ran off. Ain't that somethin'? Yeah, I didn't think that dumb shit was smart enough to save his own ass. Tell me somethin'. Was it worth it? Bein' a do-gooder? Please. Let my son go. Just let him go. I'm guessin' his momma be dead and his uncle. Soon, his daddy. He all alone in this world, just like me. Maybe I'll be his daddy. Hell, I ain't got no family. My brother's gone. He's up in heaven, meetin' his maker. What did you say? What did you say? I said he ain't in no heaven. Come on. Donnie. Good, you... You, I've got you. God, have you? God. Good. I couldn't kill it. I'm sorry. I couldn't take the shot.
