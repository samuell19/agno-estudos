Especially in Mumbai It is very difficult But she was a decent girl who kept to herself She was very depressed Suddenly she committed suicide The police came and a case was registered But no one knows what happened after that People talk of ghost stories But they are all mere stories, humbug! There’s no such thing as ghost or devil in this world Someone would've seen something at night and pulled a fast one Ask him to explain Then he will make silly excuses or be evasive about it If educated people like us believe all this BS and crap? ‘What is she doing here?’ This time of night what are you looking at? We have a television too I’m talking to you Dev- Ruby? What happened? Dream Not going to work? Get ready I'll get you coffee Who is Ruby?

Name Fame Applause I thought I'll get all this if I act in movies I came to Mumbai with a heart filled with dreams After struggling for 5 long years... ...I got a movie Along with Raj Khanna It was the debut film for both of us If that had happened... ...I would've also been a star today! God knows what reason I didn't get it Anger I ended my life hastily on an impulse My dreams dissolved as just fantasy But God... ...has given me Devi now He has given me a 2nd chance too This one film will do To show the world who Ruby is No one can stop me from acting in this film Movie?! I won't accept this Did I ask you for your permission? I am just informing you I won't disturb Devi at home I won't let you disturb Ruby who is outside Tomorrow at 10'o clock sharp Raj Khanna will send his car for me You must bring Devi out Me...? You're the manager, right? What, dear? Why aren't you asleep? Shall I get you something to eat? My dear lady Who are you now? What's wrong with you?

"Million designs like a kaleidoscope Each color a ray of hope" "Billion dreams to nurture Paint colors for a perfect picture" "I am river Ganges sacred from Lord Shiva’s head" "Sister of the stars am I sparkling in the purple sky" "I am a woman fearless Listen to my wishes" You can't go there, sir "Try to win and appraise the language of my eyes" "Till the day my breath ceases to exist" "No longer a moon waning an exit" "I’ll cross the azure sky with a ladder however high" We should have signed and launched her first - She is simply superb, sir - Who...? Heroine...next Sridevi Mark my words! She isn't a heroine She is my wife She is possessed This alone you won't hear! Not Hema Malini She's the next Sridevi If a girl has beauty any man is putty in her hands If she has brains she can rule the land If she has brain and beauty she can rule the whole world What did you say?

Her life…? Devi…how are you connected to her? You were waiting for her to leave When you had no feelings for her… …how does it bother you if I use Devi’s body? You wanted to get rid of her Go But whatever happens I won’t leave her body What are you doing here? Everyone is waiting for you at the conference hall Media, photographers are waiting for you Stop it Stop it 'Ruby, I’ll tell everyone the truth' She isn’t Ruby, sir 'What is this, sir?' 'She is not Ruby' 'My wife has been possessed' 'Revolver Raja 003' is a super hit Ruby is the next superstar' Mark of a manager! His sense of gratitude is commendable We make films We act in films Sometimes without our knowledge reel life merges into real life There’s hardly any difference between these 2 lives I realized it while working in this film Ruby is not only beautiful She is very talented too The best co-star I’ve got so far The best person I have met till date 'Name' 'Fame' 'Applause' 'I thought I'll get all this if I act in movies' Madam! What happened? ‘Today - 03:10 p.m Sanjeevani Hospital, Mumbai’ Sir, doctor wants to see you Are you married? You loved madam But madam... ...loves me If I see her shed a single teardrop- How is madam? God Almighty! When did this happen? You never informed me Doesn’t matter, sir When is junior Raja due? I’ll do it, sir What do we tell them, sir? ‘Revolver Raja 4’ We can dream a 100 wishes But God decides what should come true Just because your fate was sealed… …you have no right to re-write other’s destiny I beg you Give her back to me Wha...where? Hospital? You are fine, right? I am the one with the problem, huh? Is my illness beyond cure? What kind of dress is this? Hospital gown, huh? For the 1st time in the world… …a husband will tell his wife this What? You’ll soon be a mother What are you doing? Getting the clothes from the terrace you dropped the towel - Bring it - Is it so? What happened? My dear wife! Let go of me What are you looking at? There was a board on that wall It had fallen down this morning I threw it away thinking it was trash Is it something important? No…? Thank God ‘2 years later’ Go to work "Million designs like a kaleidoscope Each color a ray of hope" "Zillion dreams to nurture Paint colors for a perfect picture" Rock on...!
