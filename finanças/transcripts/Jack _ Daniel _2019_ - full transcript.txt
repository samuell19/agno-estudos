Hi. This is Daniel. - Welcome, sir. How are you? - Fine, sir. Where is ISBC Bank? It's at the Dutch square, sir. Let's go there then. Well, the Chief Minister is waiting for you at the guest house. I'll talk to CM. Let's go to the bank first. Head straight to ISBC Bank. You are in uniform, right? So you better be here. I'll be right back. - Sir. Welcome, Mr. Daniel Alexander. Please sit down. - Thank you, sir. Home Minister and I were talking about you, just now. Kerala Police has a bad reputation of demanding CBI's support, whenever a sensational case comes up. Unfortunately, it is happening again. Coming to the point... A crook, who can be called an inborn criminal or an intellectual giant. He is your target. Isn't that so? - Yes, sir. Within the past 1.5 years, he has hit 14 times. Without any evidence. Sir, do you have the visuals of the accused, or any other information? Nothing till now. How can we get it, sir? CCTV cameras are all kept so high, without being proportionate! (in broken Tamil) Daniel, if we keep this at a lower position, if some people come and rob it, what do we do? I can understand Malayalam. Please talk in Malayalam, sir. How? My mother is from Palakkad. She's a Malayali. I mean.. we've kept them on top, out of the fear whether someone would steal them, if we keep them below. Is there any problem in keeping them at the top? Dear officer... - Sir. So far, there have been 14 robberies. 1780 Crores. And we only have... 14 pieces of paper that he left at the crime scene, with the amount stolen written on them. That too, in 14 fabricated hand writings. He's sending it across to the media promptly too. Sir, how many people has he robbed so far? What's the common link between them and him? Of course, our files would have a list of the complainants. If we check it thoroughly, we can get some small clue. Daniel, there won't be anyone's name on that list. Why, sir? Whatever he robbed so far, was black money! Sir, we don't know who lost money, and how much they lost. There's not even one complaint. We ourselves came to know that it is 1700 Crores, from the media. How can I investigate this case, sir? Money... Be it black or white... Doesn't it belong to the people? In a country or state, there would be some black money. People need black money to buy groceries like chilli, coriander or sugar, right? Sir, excuse me. - No point making faces. Come to the point. - Sir... I think all of this is quite weird. I don't know whom to catch, or whom to save. I don't even know why I should save them! Sir, please let me go. I don't fit into this case. I totally agree with you. But we can't think like how others think, right? We are police! Only if we nab him & send him behind bars, we can find the origin of the black money. So let us first catch the guy! Yes, sir. - Good. Making faces, when you run out of answers? Sorry, sir. - It's okay. As a Chief Minister, I have only one thing to say. Black money should be wiped out from our land. And then, shut the mouths of the media. The Government and Police have become clowns, in front of the people. Isn't that true, Koyapparamban? - Totally. That's it. Catch him within 2 days, and shoot him dead! This man... - Well... I just said that because of my wish to see him. And one more thing. This is Kerala. The wind here is different. I have seen storms, sir. - Storms are different, Kerala winds are different. Okay, Daniel. - Sir. The next time we meet, everything should have a solution. Sure, sir. Sir... Don't worry, sir. We couldn't lock him, despite trying our level best. And this outsider Daniel is going to do that? Well... Even if he locks him, we will unlock that lock. We shouldn't let him gain accolades, making fools out of us! You won't let him, right? Sir, I swear on my mom, I also won't let him. Yes! Sir! He is Crime Branch officer Philippose. He's the leader of the team which investigated this case so far. And his sub-ordinate officer Hariharan. Sir... - Meet Mr. Daniel. Let's do our level best. Sir... When you didn't pick up my calls, I got really tensed. I switched off my phone deliberately. Well.. Have they reached? - They reached long back. They're waiting upstairs. Come. No problems, right? - Hey! Don't send anyone to my room for a while. Send only after I tell you. Okay? - Okay, Ma'am. Please come. Good morning! Hello, Father! Anything to drink? We don't need anything. Thanks. Then without further ado... let's proceed with our deal. - Yes. Okay, right? - Done. Okay, sir. Okay. My dear friends!! My God! - Who are you? Listen! Hands up! - Father, he has a gun! Don't make noise! Madam, I won't trouble you. I won't take any of the bank's white money. But this... This doesn't belong to the bank! This is an illegal transaction without the Government's knowledge! I mean, black money! So if you make noise, it would be trouble for yourselves. If such a deal happens at the bank... Father! Oh no! Interfering when I'm saying something? Please! No! Oh no! Look over there. Police! Hello! Hi honey! What's your name? - Shehnai. Shehnai? - Pamba Shehnai? Pamba Shehnai? Padma Shenoy! - Nice name! Don't cry, aunty! Don't be scared. This is just a perfume! Smell! Smell!! Nice smell, huh? She passed out so soon! Must be due to her sweat! Sir! No one should go outside this bank, without our permission. Okay? Yes, sir! So, you are the informer? Call the number you called earlier, once again. And tell the Commissioner, what I tell you. Come on, fast. We have to take some action. Three of you, go inside. Quick! Sir... Who knows whether that guy has a gun or other weapons? Hello! What's happening? Sir, he has seen me. And any problem? He has a gun with him, sir. I will put him on. - Okay. Here. Hello, Commissioner! It is peaceful here now. But if anyone tries to enter this place, in any way, things will get more complicated. What do you want? That's a fair question. I'll write down my demands and send it with a priest. Okay. You may leave, Father. When I come out, the manager will be at my gun-point. We need a car there to escape. When we leave in that car, none of you should follow us. We will be going directly to a heli-pad. There should be a helicopter for us to escape, at the heli-pad. If I say all this, I know that you, Kerala Police, won't do a damn thing. But I must escape, right? Who is upstairs? - Where is the priest? - Did the priest go up? Where is the priest? - What, sir? Where is that Father? - I sent him away. Go and search where he is! Mr. Daniel... My only question is... how did he transport the suitcase that contained the money, out from there? I can tell you, sir. Please have a look. These are the visuals, after he went out, disguised as the priest. Within minutes, if so many people and media reached there, he must have informed them himself. Sir, see this guy with a red cap. Observe his bag, sir. It's thin. That means... there is nothing in it. Yes. Did you notice him alone going inside, while all the other media persons were outside? Did you see? While coming out of the washroom, his bag has become bigger. That means, it has the suitcase with money in it. Such a huge robbery happened right under the nose of the police, people and media. Brilliant fellow! God! What if the journalists had found this footage! Then we can't even step out, calling ourselves policemen. Sir, can you please do me a favour? - Tell me. Can you arrange the footage covered by the media persons that day? Why not? Philip! - Sir. You do all the necessary arrangements for him. Okay? - Sure, sir. 'Here begins a great battle' 'A feast to the eyes' 'There is might on either side' 'The tricks, moves, blows and blocks are awesome' 'Who is ahead of you?' 'Who is behind you?' 'Waiting for the right opportunity, the game will continue, fabulously' 'As good deeds spreading smiles' 'As kindling desires' 'Both of them are treading this path' 'Is this unknown story extending to the public paths?' 'Where has meaning disappeared?' 'Who is more talented?' 'Who is stronger?' 'Who is going to win?' 'Who is more talented?' 'Who is stronger?' 'Who is going to win?' This is the footage covered by the media, from outside the bank. Pause. Play the footage of the bank interiors. - Okay. Pause. Have you noticed anything common in this footage? Common? - We don't know anything, sir. No. I don't know anything. Okay, zoom! This is the CCTV footage of the bank. Pause. If you check this out, the time is 10.45 AM on both visuals. In this visual, one guy is going outside, wearing a cap, from inside. And in this visual, the same guy with a cap, is coming outside. Yes! Yes! I got it! Shit! One second! Shit! He has been overlapped. Some fool overlapped him. That's me, sir. Okay, let's go to the playground. Come on, guys. Is he going to play in between all this? What's he going to do there? Still, we couldn't identify that guy with the cap, right? Why didn't we have this idea of getting the footage from the channel? I had also thought about it. If he had identified this guy, we would have been disgraced in front of the DGP. You masked and saved the honour of Kerala Police. True, sir. Thank you, sir. He left in a car from this ground. Then... The only possible way to go out, is that one. Is there a CCTV camera anywhere here? No, sir. As you can see, all buildings are under construction. So, CCTV...? Philip... - Yes, sir. He left the bank in the disguise of a priest, at sharp 10.35 AM. And at 10.43 AM, he came back inside the bank, in another disguise, with a red cap on him. So within this difference of 8 minutes, he wouldn't have gone too far. And... Is there an underground parking, anywhere nearby? Yes, sir. There's a shopping mall nearby. They have underground parking there. Then get me the footage! Yeah. Zoom in. - Okay. Sheesh! This is so vulgar. Shut up! - Sir. He is changing his clothes. While coming back, he will come with the money, 100%. Fast forward the footage a bit. - Okay. So he's not alone. There are people to help him. Yeah! Yeah! Stop! Back! Freeze! There he is! Guys! We got him! Such a familiar face. Oh! Is it this guy? Do you know him? I swear on my mom, I don't. I have seen him... ... somewhere earlier. 'O lightning, O wave, which came beside me and disappeared' 'How did you move away so cleverly without me spotting you?' 'My eyes spotted the thief who disappeared into thin air today' 'Have you cast a net for him, in your thoughts?' 'There are many tricks up his sleeve' 'Don't make any mistakes' 'Be on your toes' 'Your opponent is coming from a distance' 'The game is getting addictive' 'Who is more talented?' 'Who is stronger?' 'Who is going to win?' 'Who is more talented?' 'Who is stronger?' 'Who is going to win?' Sir, his name is Jack. He exports vegetables and handicrafts. Petrol bunks, automobile agencies, supermarkets, These are all his businesses, and he stays in Judges' Avenue. Why should someone with so many businesses & money, steal or rob? These are all just masks. See, he's not robbing thousands or lakhs... He's robbing Crores! If he gets caught some time, the answer to the question that where did all this money come from... These small businesses are for that. Well, sir... Since we've identified him, why can't we go and arrest him directly? Proof? See! With this proof, we can't arrest him. He will come out easily. Sir, you know that. Yeah, I know. - We should have solid evidence. If so, if we raid his house, what if we find some solid evidence? No! No! If we do a raid, he will become alert. It's not a good idea. Then I have another idea. We can say that it's an income tax department raid, right? - Yeah! That's a good idea. Okay, sir. Excuse me... Hello? Excuse me? Who are you? - We are from the Income Tax department. We have a search warrant. - Okay. Go ahead. - Well... Jack? Hello? Excuse me? Sir will take 10-15 minutes to wake up. Don't disturb him. Why is he sitting under a tree & sleeping, despite having such a huge house? Hey! He is meditating! To meditate under a tree, who is he? Lord Buddha? Idiot. Shut up! Thank you, sir. You please come. You can start. Come. Sorry. If there was a Banyan tree, it would have been awesome. - What about a coconut tree? Tea or coffee? - I'll have a juice. A green tea. - A glass of milk. - Coffee. - A strong tea. I shouldn't have asked. Hey! I'll make all these. Those who need it, come and drink it! Did you find any evidence? - No. Nothing. Then check the next room. - Okay, sir. What is it, Rametta? An income tax raid is going on. I can sit here, right? You can sit, sir. But I can't keep calm now. Juice, coffee, tea and what not! Let me go there. Don't know what they would ask next. It's all glass. Nice! What's the point, having so much money? His fate is to sleep on the floor. Did you find anything? - Nothing! How will you? It's all glass here. Got a buzz only now! Hello, gentleman! Hi, sir. Please. Please sit, sir. - DYSP Philippose. Jack. What's the programme on TV? Nothing. Some programmes happening here... Programmes happening here? - Yes. Can you see visuals of all the rooms, over here? Yes. You really like whiskey, right? See! When I left from home quickly for the raid, I forgot to take the homeopathy medicine for my knee-pain. Instead of that.. The base of all this is spirit & alcohol, right? So, a small... - Okay, okay! Nice! How do you feel now? - Yeah! Better! Better! That's great! Do you have any other disease, sir? - No! Never! I mean, piles or something? - Not at all! Sheesh! Well, when I saw your sitting posture... That's my style! Oh! Nice style! Keep it up! - Thank you! What is this? A gramophone? Nice! Beautiful! What is this? A rock? Oh! It's a soap! Let me wash my face then! I can get rid of this fatigue. Scoundrel! Oh no! What is this? A jungle-dweller? It's all foreign stuff. Wow! An expensive perfume! See! See his innocence! Phew! No one saw it! Where all has he kept cameras? I had even gone to pee in between! What? - What? Great visuals! Nice performance too! That's it. Your team is the best! This must be how people become fair. Hello sir! Please come. SI Sir has become really fair, right? Totally! Is it true? - Yeah. Sir, there's an awesome soap kept upstairs. I became so fair, using that. I saw that. We saw everything on TV. Did it come on the news channel? Hey! That's not a face cream, by the way. - Then? It's a cream used to polish white shoes. That's why it's burning so much. So it won't go now? - Yes. Just brush a white shoe on your face! Is it? - See! This is what they say 'Tried to get fair, but ended up with splotches'. Yes! Yes! Sorry sir. We got a wrong information. Sorry for the inconvenience. It's okay. Thank you. Gentleman... Actually, sorry. We got a wrong information. Sorry for the inconvenience. Didn't they just say the same thing? - No! No! No! This is the official confirmation. I am the officer. Okay, Jack! You enjoy your day! - Thank you. We'll come by some time. - No. I'll send the whiskey to you. See you, sir. Rametta... - Okay. Catch! Jack! Guys, you carry on! Why have you come at this time, sir? Even after so many problems happened, you're still playing around? Why didn't you inform me? What, sir? What was this raid for? They said it was due to a false information. No! No! No more arguments and explanations. Something wrong! You stay away for a few days. Let me investigate. Come back only when I tell you to. Sir, should we take it so seriously? - It's serious! Okay. Then I'll leave this Sunday. No! Tomorrow itself. Okay. I'll go to Goa tomorrow itself. Why do you keep going to Goa these days? Isn't Goa a beautiful place, sir? Sorry. - It's all right. Five. Sudoku. Five. Thank you. Seven. Yes! Oops! So embarrassing. What happened? Sorry! This is the first time I'm completing a Sudoku, in my life. So I got really excited. Good. Congrats. Where are you going, Sudoku? Goa. Oh! What do you do? I'm a freelance photographer. Do you work there? - No. In Kerala. I'm going to Goa to meet my friends. Oh! Okay. I'm Susmitha. I'm Jack. Welcome to Goa. Nice meeting you. - See you! Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Everything fine? - Your room is ready. Hi. How are you? - Everything fine, sir. Thank you. - Welcome, sir. Keep the change. Thank you. - Welcome. Hello! We... At the airport? Oh! Sudoku. - Yes. Please. Thank you. It's a special joy to have food while talking to someone we know. Oh! Sorry. I already had my food. And I'm in a hurry to leave, as well. Who else can give you company...? Oh God! Peter Hein! Sir, can I take a picture with you? - Okay. It's Peter Hein! Who's that? You don't know Peter Hein? No. But I've heard his name somewhere. The first Malayali who doesn't know Peter Hein! I'll set you straight now. He has so many fans, huh? Of course! All over the world! The world famous Vietnamese singer. Pop singer. Is it? - Yes. I don't really listen to music... It's all right. I'm seeing him for the first time. I can't believe it. Just a minute. Sir, water. - Okay. Thank you. No! Not allowed! Peter Master, excuse me. Just one minute. Let him come. Thank you. I am Jack. Hello Jack. I'm a big fan of yours. I've seen your movies. Your fights... Wow! What do I say! I'm really surprised. Master, I'm so sorry. Can I take a selfie with you? Sure! Sure! Keep smiling! Thank you. Master, look at that girl. She's my friend. Hi. - Hi. She really likes your songs. Songs? -Yes. - My songs? - Yes. I've never sung any song! But that girl told me that she loves your songs. How? I've sung only in my bathroom. But how does that girl know that? I don't know how. But she seems to have heard it somewhere. - One minute, please. [Speaking in Vietnamese] Master, please sing a song for her. No! No! No! I can't sing a song here. It won't come for me. I can't sing here. - Compel him. He will sing. Sir, just one song. Please, sir. Okay. Okay. 2 lines. Maximum, 4 lines. Okay. - Up to six lines. Okay? - Okay. [Singing a popular viral song] Hey Master! Come, dance! Bodyguards! Dear friends, we welcome you all for this chess competition. To participate in this game, there's a fee of 2500, per head. And if you win, or at least if you tie with your opponent, you will be getting 25,000. So, all the very best... and have a great time ahead! Hey you! Wanna try? - No! Come on, man! Come on! Hey please! - No, thanks. Try your luck, no? - No! No! Not interested? Cool. Hey man! Come! Come! Hello! Hi Sudoku. - Hi. How was his song yesterday? Song? You were fooling me, right? What happened? Whom did you say Peter Hein was? Vietnamese pop singer. Vietnamese pop singer, it seems. I Googled him. He's the number one stunt master in India. And after you left, there was a huge fight there. It was a chance given by God to me, so that I'll never forget you, Sudoku. - Yeah right! - Hey brother! Would you like to join? Just pay 2500, and get 25,000 cash. Come, bro. - Okay. Shall we try playing a game? To put me in trouble again? No! No! It's very interesting. But I don't know how to play chess. - Is it? You don't know? - No. Good! That's what's needed for this game. Excuse me, bro. - Yes. She's my friend. Excellent player. Really? I think you should try. - No! No! I don't know to play. - No! Use the brain! Beat them! Come on! - Come on! Bro, one thing... - Yeah. Can one person play with two people at the same time? She can. - Are you sure? - Yes. 2500+2500. Just pay 5000, and you can. No issue. - Wow. That's great! - Cool. Hey! Stop kidding! - No! No! I'll pay the money. 2500 and 2500. Totally 5000. - You'll lose that money! We've got a new player who has doubled up the game! Please give him a big applause! Please! What foolishness are you doing, Jack? I don't know how to play this! You'll lose your money, mind it! Sudoku, you relax! The game will start in front of two people, at two different tables. Now listen to me very carefully. And do whatever I say. All the best. You're going to get me killed, right? Listen carefully, and do as I say. While you play with the first person, your coins would be black. While playing with the second person, they would be white. When the game starts, the white coin player who sits opposite you, will make the first move. Once he makes his move, you shouldn't make your move in a haste... Instead, act like you're thinking... and get up and go to the black coin player. There, your coins are white, right? Wherever the first white coin guy moved his coin to, place your white coin, against the black coin player. Then, the black coin player would move his coin. Don't forget that. Remember it, and make the same move against the white coin guy. Understood? If you do that, the game would be happening between them both. You will be just a mediator, okay? Wow! It's a draw! Yes! Draw! Excellent! Yes! Yaay! - Yeah! Hi bro! Draw! Winning prize. 25+25 = 50,000. Thank you. As you said, she's an excellent player. - Really? Congrats. - What the hell is happening here? All this money is for you, Jack. No! I just need the money I spent. Rest all is for you, Sudoku. Well, what are you going to do with this money? With this money... I have to buy something for my parents. My first prize money! That's good. Who all are there at your home? Papa and Mumma. We're settled in Delhi. Papa is working there. Is that so? What about your house, Jack? I... I have many people. The number of people close to me, is growing day by day! And now, you too! Where are you going now? Nothing particular. There's an exhibition happening nearby. Are you free? I am free. - Then join me. - Okay. Such a small... Sorry. Though it's so small, it will be really expensive, right? It will be really expensive, but it's not for sale. Awesome! This place has a collection of costly diamonds. - Okay. Rare pieces. What? Saw this necklace? During 17th Century, a Swedish prince called Frederick William gifted this to his lover. Do you know how much it is worth? In Indian currency, it's Rs. 16 Crores. 16 Crores? Hello! What happened? Well, that prince must have been so madly in love with his girlfriend, right? Otherwise, would he gift her such an expensive necklace? You're still stuck there? Then why don't you buy it for yourself? People like me can only dream about it. Otherwise, there is one way. I should steal it. Steal it? From there? That place has tight security! Didn't you see, Sudoku? Jewels are all preserved in glass vessels and glass pillars. Even if our breath falls on them, there would be a pressure variation, and alarms would ring. How do you know all this, Jack? Shouldn't we know about things that are happening around us? This is no big deal. Just search Google, and you'll get all the details. Well, what's your plan, Sudoku? How many days are you here? Jack! You..!! Thought you could fool us and escape? Return the 50,000 Rupees you took from us. We won it from the game, right? - No such games will work here. You better return our cash. Or we will finish off your lover! Hey! I'm not his lover or anything. We just met. - Shut up! Enough of your drama! Pay the money & take your lover back. See! I told you, right? I'm not his lover. - Then you give the money. How will I give it? Half the money is with him. Where did he go? Where is he? I don't know. Right when I was thinking about making her my lover, you're calling her my lover? Hold this, Sudoku. Step aside. Did you guys come with him? Just say sorry to her & go! Shall we go? Hey Sudoku! Let's go. Oh my God! - Handle with care, okay? Yes. Thank you. Come. So what were we saying? About going back to Kerala, right? Yes. Sir, he's a trained fighter. How did you understand that? Did you see his style? He's a martial artist. Who's that girl with him? Did he go to Goa, to meet her, by any chance? Maybe. Sir, as soon as possible... I will submit much more details to you. Hope so. - I'll do my level best, sir. Hi Sudoku. Did you get back? Yes, I got back. I'm in the city now. I'm also in the city. Where in the city? Tell me the exact place. The water tank on Church road? I'm in front of that. Okay. From there, exactly 16 steps. Towards south. Walk forward. For what? Walk, dear. Thirteen... Fourteen... Fifteen... Sixteen... Now, 15 steps to your left. One... Two... Fourteen... Fifteen. There is a way to the left from there, right? 5 steps that way. One.. Two... Three... Four... Now, 3 steps to the right. How much? - 2500. Twelve... Thirteen... I've reached. Now, look towards your right. Hi! Hey! How did you do this? I thought you must be behind me. How is it possible? This is my city, right? I know every nook and corner here, by heart. If I close my eyes like this, I can see every movement of yours. GPS? No. JPS. Jack Position System. A system that brings you to Jack's position. But still... how? - Nothing. Hold this. Don't think too much and stress your mind. Do you like pigeons? Yes. A little too much. Why? Any problem? Haven't you heard about pigeons, Sudoku? Pigeons can remember the routes they've travelled, up to 800 kms. That's why pigeons were used for communication, until post & telegraph came into being. And pigeons are the symbol of love, right? Aren't they the symbol of peace? Yes. Only if there is love, there would be peace, right? Where is your vehicle? - I've kept it there. Okay. So let's go in my car, take it, and then you can follow me. Alex! Take them into the cage. - Okay, sir. Beautiful! Such a beautiful house. Do you stay alone here? If you ask me whether I stay alone, I don't. They are all here to give me company, right? Come. This is Ramettan. - Namaste. This is my friend, Susmitha. She's a photographer. - Please come inside. I'll make tea. - No. Today I'll make tea. Let it be my special. - Okay. Please sit, Sudoku. I'll go make tea & come. Okay. Come. Your tea. Thank you. How is it? Awesome! Actually, when you drink tea, if you want to relish its true taste, do you know how you should drink it? I'll show you. Take the cup. Then... Sheesh! Why? - I'll drink like this. Okay! That's it! Come. Who are they? My brother and family. 4 policemen were admitted to the hospital, including the S.I. Home Minister Koyapparamban told the media that an investigation would be conducted, and strict action would be taken against the culprits. Against this injustice against the police, the Government has decided to take a strong stand, and charge a case. As long as this Koyapparamban is the Home Minister, we won't spare anyone. Poor policemen. They are being punished for the crimes committed by thieves. This won't happen if the policemen do they duty correctly, right? Even if the policemen want to do good, would politicians like him allow them to do so? That's true. - Yes. When did we start hearing figures like 1000 Crores & 10,000 Crores? Once the corruption stories of politicians started coming out, right? Yet, do we have the courage to look at these corrupt guys' faces, and call them 'thieves'? 90% of the crimes that happen here, are a joint business by the politicians and the police. If you believe otherwise, I'll give you another proof. - What's that? A deal is happening at Hotel Rwanda on beach road, tomorrow. To be precise, a black money transaction. Do you know who's accepting that money? THE Home Minister Koyapparamban. Koyapparamban? - Yeah! No! You're kidding! I'm not kidding! Koyapparamban will take that money & leave, with police escort! If you're smart enough, try to inform the police & get it blocked! Bet? Bet! 100%! The winner should buy ice cream. - That's nice. I liked that. Then get going. - Let that be. How do you know all this, Jack? I know. I'm an ordinary voter of this society, right? Then I'll definitely inform this to the police. Okay. All the best! Where has she gone? It's been quite some time. Let me go check anyway. Oops. Can't hear anything! Has she left? Aren't you a policeman, sir? No! Then what about this cap & uniform? - Oh! The cap? Yes! Now, I am a police officer. You've been following me for a while, sir. Oh no! Me? Why should I? If I give you an information, can you take action? I will. Tell me the matter. A black money transaction is going to happen at Hotel Rwanda, at the beach side. It's our Home Minister who's receiving it. Who's that? The Police minister! You know who that is? I swear on my mom! I don't. Isn't it Koyapparamban? - Oh! Koyapparamban! Our Minister! You should inform this to your superiors at the earliest. Okay. I'll do it. Just a minute. - Make sure that you do it, sir. Don't go! Don't go! Are you leaving? Then let her go! Hello? What happened? Did you get any information about her? No, sir. She got all information about me, though. Then? Then, there is no problem. But, she told me something. - What? Sir! Sir, an important information. Tomorrow, at Hotel Rwanda on the beach side, black money is coming, for our Home Minister. What are you saying? - Yes, sir. That girl who's with Jack, told this to Hari. Why should she say it to Hari? This is what Hari told me. If that girl has got that information, she must have known it from Jack. So he won't come, 100%. Why would he come? Maybe, it's a wrong lead. What if... she passed this information without Jack's knowledge? My intuition says that... he will definitely come there! Guys! Minister will be leaving from this guest house. He will be going to Hotel Rwanda, through this Palace road. After the transaction at Rwanda, he will be going back, through the same route. There are 2 possibilities for the money to be stolen. One, Hotel Rwanda. Two, this road. Sir, on the road? Listen. It's easy for him on the road. Because only the police would be there. True. The security measures would be higher at the hotel. Exactly. After minister leaves the hotel, anything can happen. So the total territory should be under our control. Clear? - Sir. If he comes, he shouldn't go back. Sir, careful. I'll fall if I'm not careful, right? Let me fall if have to! Sir... Everything is okay, right? Everything is okay. Shall we catch that minister? For what? Well... - We should be catching Jack, who's coming to steal that bag. I know that. But still, that minister! If we catch the minister, we'll lose our jobs. If we catch the thief, we'll get promoted. What do you want? Sir, both are thieves, right? That's our fate! Sir, the information we got is correct. They have a bag. Sir... You keep an eye on them. Okay, sir. Why did you stop? - Sir, police has surrounded us. They are our policemen, you fool! Just go! That's true. - Stupid policemen! Sir, they have started. Copied. Follow them. Okay, sir. Let's go! Yes! That's him! That's Jack's car, sir. Sir, Jack is here. He is just in front of our vehicle. Philip, we have to catch him. Be alert. - Okay, sir. Speed up! Hello! Oh God! Really? The Central Intelligence department is waiting on the way. Don't they have any other job? If poor Ministers can't live peacefully... Stop the car! Stop the car!! Slow down. Focus on Jack's car. You do one thing. Get down here, get into the police jeep, and take a different route. Which route? - Do you want me to show you that route? - No! Where are you going? What is it, sir? - Will your daddy take this? - I should take this too? Then do one thing. Leave it. Do you want to take this? No! - Take it! Let's go to the guest house! Oh my God! Philip, just listen to me. I saw the money being shifted to that police jeep. Follow the jeep! Sir, what are you saying? When the thief is behind the minister, why should we follow the police jeep? I told you that I saw the money being shifted! Why don't you understand? Just hurry up! - Then why don't you send someone else? By the time someone else comes, he might escape! Come on, man! - No, sir. Please ask Rajesh to follow him. That's it! After sending everyone in different directions, he wants to catch the thief on his own & take credit. That won't happen! Sir, I have a doubt. What if Daniel himself is Jack? Chances for that are very less. Why did the Minister go that way? Did he forget to steal or what? Not that, sir. He didn't forget. He wouldn't have seen him. - Damn it! Stop! Stop! Stop! Pull over. - That's not Jack! He will be in the car. I needn't come, right sir? You wait here. - Of course. What happened? What happened, sir? I have no idea! What's happening? Sir, we've taken the Minister safely to the guest house. What about Jack? Which Jack? I mean... Jack wasn't in the car, sir. I can follow the jeep now. - Isn't that what I told you earlier? Yes, sir. - You should have listened to me. Philip, 5 bikes are on the way on Cantonment Road. One of them is Jack. At any cost, block him! - Copy, sir. Hari, go to Cantonment Road, quickly! Sir. - Quick! Some of you go that side. You come this side. - Okay, sir. You guys catch 3 bikes, we will catch 2 bikes. Okay? - He is coming! Be alert! What is this? A bike rally? Sir, did he say 5 bikes or 500 bikes? That's my doubt too! Oh God! Hari, how do we find Jack among them? Very soon! Good morning. - Good morning, sir. Sir, those bike riders were all members of different riding clubs. They have no connection with yesterday's incident. I know that. Where is D.G.P.? He's about to leave, to meet the Minister, sir. Good morning, sir. - Good morning! Minister has summoned me. To ask about yesterday's robbery. It was his money, right sir? That's why he's worried. - Exactly! But you know one thing? - Sir... Jack has given the precise accounts to all the channels. Sir, this Jack is not alone, sir. Behind him, there is a big group! It was a well executed plan! Unfortunately, we failed. I'm sorry, sir. I partially disagree with you. Why? - If there was full co-operation & co-ordination from our department, I could have arrested him & presented him before you, by now. But we had a good chance. We missed it! We won't get such chances always. If we don't get chances, we should create them, sir. But one thing, sir. If I have the full control of our team, we can easily nail him. Yes, I understand. Where is Philip? - On the way, sir. Ask him to come & meet me, as soon as he reaches. Daniel... - Sir... I'll see it it that this doesn't happen again. And watch the game... - Sir. What is happening here? What happened, sir? A guy from outside was imported because the policemen here weren't good enough, right? But, have the robberies stopped? Why, sir? Did you lose anything? - No!! I haven't lost anything. Then whom did it belong to, sir? My P.A's some... This guy's!! What did he lose, sir? One Rupee that his father gave him, during his childhood. I've told you that I don't like files! One Rupee that his grandma gave him. After saving up all that to make $10 Crores, on the way to Guruvayoor temple to make an offering, a thief stole it. Didn't you complain after that? It's God's money, right? Are we supposed to complain? That's true! What the hell are you saying? It was me who lost the money! You? - My.... The guy who is with me. His money! But he's not saying anything. If you speak, I'll kill you. What did you say? He's not saying anything, sir. He is a mute. This guy? Father... One Rupee.... Grandma... One Rupee.... Father... Grandma... Enough! Enough! Enough! Hold this. Will you catch him anytime soon? Sir, we are after him! That's enough! You and your damn file! Hey lady! Don't you have eyes? Is this how you cross the road? Why did you stop the car? I jumped in front of it, to die. Oh! So it was a suicide attempt? If we jump in front of police vehicles, there won't be a case against you, right? Oh! Who told you all this foolishness? What is your problem? Who are you? My name is Fathima. You know Hisbullah textiles & jewellery's owner Hisbullah? I am his wife. Oh! You are Hisbullah's wife? - Yes. Why did you try to commit suicide, Madam? I really love my husband. That's not a problem, right? - That's a problem for me. What problem? Now my husband is in an extra marital relationship with another woman. Oh! That's a problem! That is my problem. But how do you know that? I saw it with my own eyes! She comes to the shop at sharp 7 PM, every day. After that, my husband goes out with her. They come back only when it is time to close the shop. See, dear. Your husband is a businessman, right? So those might be some business meetings! But what is this business with her alone? Well... If that was the case, why didn't you ask this to him directly? I wanted to ask him many times. Then? - But I have a fear somewhere deep within me. If my husband admits that the relationship is true, I will die of heart-break! We have 5 children! One is 1.5 years old, another is 2.5 years old, then a 3.5 years old, then a 4.5 years old and a 6.5 years old. Does he get time to do business? God gives all these, right? Please don't cry. Keep this. Wipe your tears. Poor girl. Sorry. - It's okay. Keep it. You might need it. Let me enquire. Look. It's not 7 PM yet. Let's go there now. - Oh God! Me? Won't he recognize me? How will he recognize you? You're wearing this Parda, right? No one will recognize you. Come. - But still.. Sister, I won't allow any family to be destroyed. I am a public servant and you are a public. Police is for the society! Please come. Hello! See if my husband is coming. He is coming! Come & collect it from the office. - Over there. I've told them everything. Oh God! Okay. - Two phones! He has shown only one phone to me so far. That's the problem with extra-marital. - Who's that? Those who are in extra-marital relationships are like this! My God! Dear, please don't be emotional. Please! He is betraying me! That cruel man! It is time. Did you see him looking at the watch? She will come at 7 PM. She will come & take him. Watch out. I'm watching. Don't bat an eyelid! Bat what? Don't bat an eyelid! Eyelid! You reached? I'm inside. Come in. - Look! He's going to meet her. We should catch them red-handed today. God! Where am I? Push! Push, dear! Phew! Oops. Sorry, Madam! Have you come to catch me or them? Don't say so, sister. I'm very sincere. I lost my balance. Shouldn't you have some control? God! Look at her coming! You are my darling! - Stop it, Ikka. Oh God! He's calling her darling! Can't you curl this hair a little bit more? Hisbullah can't be blamed. No! Hisbullah is the one to be blamed! It's a crime. I will put him behind bars! Oh God! That wretched female is touching him! My hands & knees are going weak! Oh no! Do you want to go to the hospital? No, sir. Just tell someone to send me to the cabin here. Okay! Relax! Relax! I can't stand. I need to lie down. Hello! Hello! This person is really important to me. I'm going outside for some urgent work. Until then, you should let this person sit in the office cabin. Isn't this you, sir? I am a police officer, man! I was talking about her! Sorry, sir. Please come, Madam. Go, sister. Sir, today itself... - Sister, don't worry! I will handle! I will handle! Stuff it into her throat! Fathima! Poor lady! It's on your lips. You will cheat her too! Horny horse! Shall we go? - Let's go. I will come early today. - Okay. Bye! - Bye! Mr. Hisbullah! Yes? - I am DYSP Philippose. What is it, sir? - What kind of a man are you? Your wife is alive now, only because of God's grace. Today she tried to jump in front of my car, and commit suicide, you know? My wife? - Yes. - For what? Aren't you ashamed to go around with such sluts, when you have a wife who loves you more than anything, at home? Don't talk crap! I won't consider that you're a policeman! The one who left now? That's my only wife, Fathima! No! Never! I won't agree! Here. Look! Our wedding photo! This is my wife, Fathima. Who's that Fathima then? Hey! Hey! Bike! - Sorry! Sorry, sister. You may go! - Thank you! Where is he going? Hey! Hey! Stop! What would have happened here? Sir, let this Madam sit here for a while. Who is it? - Madam... Peace be unto you! Please sit. What's your name? Nothing like that. Well... A. Gunalal. Nice name! Gunalal Ikka, can you give me some water? Why not! Appu! One glass of water! What is this? Why did you get up? I got up unknowingly! Please sit down. Don't take it off. Are you going? Madam, water. - Give it here. I'll give her. Get going! Water. Don't make me drink water! What are you doing? Someone will see us! Oh no! A gun? Sir, 25 glucose biscuits... Voting without any privacy? Come fast. People are waiting there. Where are those glucose biscuits he spoke about, hidden? Who are you to ask that? Oh no! Oh no! I am from Intelligence Department. Where is the gold hidden? I'll take out whatever you want! You didn't have to tempt me so much for that! You will be cursed! You shut up! I will kill you! Why should you kill me? It's someone else's stuff. I'll show you. Walk. - Put the gun away! Him & his damn glucose biscuits! That's all there is. Here. It had such a big cellar in there? Not just a cellar. There's a treasury too. Wanna see? The other voice is better in this dress. That way, at least those who hear it can enjoy it. You shut up! Is everything over? - Yes. Tell your boss that a dog took all the glucose biscuits! Boss won't believe me if I say that. Don't just take the biscuits. The dog should take me too. Otherwise, he will kill me. Then, shall I kill you? Sheesh! What is this? Hey! What are you doing here? Disgusting fellows! They're doing it in the godown now? Let boss come back. Without letting me join... - Shucks! Bubble gum? - Sir... What I took yesterday was the advance Koyapparamban got, from the Kuwait business deal. I will take the balance amount as well. I've taken gold, not less than 50 kgs from here, as well. Oh God! Now I'll give you a tip. A policeman should never be so sentimental! Jack. Who's he to give tips? Tipper Vasu? Rascal! Shut up! You don't have any common sense or what? When a guy dressed up as a girl, and delivered some dialogues... Well, his disguise as a woman, had so much originality! We can never figure out. It's all inside the clothes. If it's not inside the clothes? What the hell! No, sir. I meant that, it's inside a 'Pardah'. I've been called to the Minister's office, asking for an explanation. What should I say? Should I say that the thief & you were classmates? No, sir. We were not classmates! Shut up, you...!! No way! I haven't lost even a gram of gold! Excuse me, sir. - Yes, Daniel. Sir, earlier this was one-way. Only we were following him. Now it has become two-way. He has also started following us. See... He has said that he has understood that I've joined this team recently. How did you understand that? Sir, on the letter he wrote & left there, a chewing gum was stuck to the back. I have a habit of chewing gum. You know that. - Correct, sir. What do you think we should do now? Nothing. We have to be more smarter. Hi Sudoku. What's up? Why are you playing with rats, flashing a light? Just like that. Haven't you heard about rats? - No. They are one among the species, which has the most reflex action in the world. Is it? - See... Look... They come running when I throw these peanuts. Now, without throwing peanuts... I will flash this light. See! It's running, thinking that it's a peanut. But won't it realize when it comes close, that it's not a peanut? It will. It doesn't know the language to ask why I didn't throw peanuts, right? Well, what is this for? Just like that. For time pass. Well, what about Koyapparamban's money? Did you inform the police? Yes, I did. Then? - Then what? Nothing happened. Shine! Get these little ones to the cage. - Okay, sir. So who's getting the ice cream? For me. - Oh! It was me who won, right? You failed in Koyapparamban's matter, right? I'll give you one more chance. See if you can win, okay? I'll show you one thing. What is this? - A flower. It's not just a flower. It's Koyapparamban's money. This is a glass. I'm keeping this glass over this flower. Now, how can you take this flower out? Like this. - Hello! Let me complete! You have to take the flower without taking this glass with your hand, or breaking it. The glass shouldn't rise up! Simple! Look! Hey! Hey! Hey! What is this? You said I shouldn't touch it with my hand, right? - Is this your leg then? No.. This.... You can use anything that's here. I am liberal. I am really liberal. I'll do it now. What should I do now? - Are you asking me? What should I do then? You wore both gloves anyway, right? There's some cow dung outside. Put it on the plants outside. So mean! You haven't studied Chemistry? Flower is part of Biology, right? Flower in Biology? It's Botany! Aren't you educated? Make it fast anyway. Use your brain. - I don't know. You do it. - Is it? - Yes. Okay! Look. Take a little bit of this liquid and pour it over the glass like this. Without raising the glass, or touching with your hand, we can take the flower easily now. How's it? The magic of Hydrofluoric acid. Here. Koyapparamban's money, as easy as picking a flower. So that's why a Chemistry book was lying here? Well, shouldn't we go out for ice cream? - Yes, of course. I'll go change & come. Hey Sudoku! Go and meet a doctor soon! Why? I have a doubt whether your beauty is increasing! No way! - Then it must be my imagination! If this pimple wasn't there...!! What if it's a love pimple? Come. Otherwise it will be trouble for me. Nice! Did you see that girl? She has beautiful eyes. No! Don't look so quickly. Just look casually. True. Beautiful eyes. But those eyes are expecting someone. Whom? Someone! - This is the problem with you men. If a girl is sitting alone, you immediately start gossiping about her. Not gossip. It's a fact. I was waiting for a long time. - Hey! I'm so sorry, dear. Oh God! But... How did you understand that? That she was waiting for someone? Just rewind and think about the way she was eating ice cream! With the intention that the ice cream on her bowl shouldn't get over, she was taking only 1/4th of her spoon of ice cream, and having it very slowly, waiting for someone to come. Slowly.... Slowly... Really sharp! If you just notice what's happening around us, we can see many interesting things. For example... Just pay attention to them. So yeah. Tell me. What's happening? You tell me. They are a couple, right? - No. They are lovers. Yeah, right! They are husband & wife! She's a wife. Someone else's wife. And that guy is her lover. Don't be blasphemous! Do one thing. Let's try an experiment. Let's try out a WhatsApp joke. Okay? Hello! Dude, it's me. I came to have food at Sky Green restaurant. When I came here, your wife is sitting here. With her lover. if you come here, you can catch them red-handed! I'll see to it that they don't leave. Come fast. Hey! Don't go! I'll also come! Such a huge impact for a WhatsApp joke? You're always on 1000 Watts power, Jack. Always so spirited! There's one way for that. We should seek things that we're sure that we'll never be able to do, and try to do them. Then our mind would be on 1000 Watts power, full time! Is it just that? Even when you have a lot of money, you will be happy, right? I don't agree to that, Sudoku. We become the happiest in life, when we help someone else. Help can be in any way. So, without our knowledge, a positive vibration will enter us from the person who's accepting the help. That's a special kind of feeling! You can try it out, Sudoku. So you're a Yogi as well, huh? Try it out if you want to. So, this will be my programme tomorrow. Sir, please give me something. - I don't have change. This is not enough. I'll give him a little more. Chetta! Brother! Chetta, please stop. - Dear... Can you tell us where this address is? Oh! Convent! Sister, where do you want to go? - I know that. Bethany convent. - Take right from here. I want to say that! - Take this right. Sister... Can you give me some water? Not in that. To drink... Pour it in this. Enough. It's okay. Drink it. - Enough, sister. Enough! - Poor chap! You bloody! - Cheers! - Get lost! This is the best chance to help! Stop! Come. Don't worry. Okay then. - Dear... Thank you so much, dear. God bless you! Though unknowingly, you got that feel, right? That's what! And my doubt is cleared now! What? - Didn't I ask you to go to the doctor? A doubt whether your beauty is increasing! Like that? That's gone now. Beauty is definitely increasing! 'The fragrance of the flower, in the breeze that flows by this way' 'The beautiful brightness of the morning that comes after midnight' 'Who are you, capturing my heart when I'm unaware?'

What happened? Jack! Jack! Where is he going with a wreath? Brother, follow that car. Brother, speed up a bit. [Homage to brave martyr Krishnakumar] [Last respects from the army] Don't cry, mother. Shall we leave? Close that door when you leave. - Sir. Come in! Hi sir. - Hi Susmitha! Looking good! Sit down. - Sir. So... I want to tell you something. That's why I called you here now. Like you said, Jack has a connection with the Indian Army. He's an ex- NSG Commando. NSG Commando? Very intelligent! Dangerous! Determined! Even his elder brother was an NSG officer. Jack lost his parents when he was a child itself. Later, it was his brother who raised him, educated him & recruited him into the army. In a way, his brother, brother's wife and their kids, was Jack's world. Suddenly one day, we heard that his brother died. It was during some terrorist attack. He had also come along with the corpse. After that we saw Jack.... It was after one year. For his sister-in-law's death. She also died? Yes. She also died. But it wasn't a natural death. It was a suicide. Do you remember sending me a photo? Mr. GK Nair. Yes, sir. - He runs a trust called Indians for Indian Army. Soldiers who were injured on duty, families of soldiers who are dead... This trust was floated to help such people. It has grown so much that.... many big schools, colleges, small scale industries, hospitals and much more, are running under that trust. And the point is... this trust has expanded so much, only after Jack met Mr. Nair. So it is crystal clear. There is a connection between the growth of the trust & Jack's robberies. 100 %. Since it is a trust, we cannot track where the money is coming from, or who is paying them money. So... If we have to nail Jack... we need to catch him red-handed! Sir, if we think about it, isn't he doing a good deed? If we think about it, it's a good deed. But unfortunately... we shouldn't be thinking like that. Because, we are..... cops! Sorry, sir. - No. Don't feel sorry. Give it there. - Hi hero! Hello sir! How are you today? - I'm good, sir. Meet Susmitha IPS. Hi. Hello Ma'am! I know what you're thinking. It's not twins. This is the same girl! I thought I'd tell you about this earlier... But I thought I'd tell you after I have confidence over you. Sir...? I'm joking. Thanks for coming. My duty, sir. - Good job! See you, Ma'am. - See you. And Phil... - Yeah! I've been saying a lot of lies lately. So... I need to make a confession at the Church. Confession? Why? When you look at my face, does it feel like I'm always lying? Not like that, sir. That's okay. Then... About this Susmitha... Let it be confidential. - Sure, sir. Okay? Good. My dear people, God will shower endless blessings to the laps of the generous. This is what Holy Apostle Paul has taught us. He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. Only those who sow, have the rights to reap. God is with you! May the Almighty God, the Father, the Son & the Holy Spirit bless you. Hi. Hi sir. How was Father's speech? Good! Very good! What I liked in it.... was that only those who sow have the rights to reap. But birds only reap, they don't sow. Those are birds. Anyway... I am Daniel Alexander. I know you. The nightmare of Bombay underworld. The most dangerous encounter specialist. You work in the CBI. Now, you're helping the Kerala Police on special deputation. Is it? Good. Very well informed. About me...? I know a little. That's enough. Are you happy with this profession? Why did you ask so? Well... When some shady politicians here, interfere in your official matters... I mean, pressure? Pressure? Be it a politician... or a thief... I only have a habit of giving them pressure! Have you heard of the Cheetah? It is only slow until it sees its prey. Once it spots its prey, its speed would be on a different level! Wherever the prey is, it won't be spared. The prey is also like that, sir. It is only after knowing who's coming behind it, it decides whether it should turn back & attack, or it escape from there. Jack! You know how this Daniel is? I won't run. If I run, I won't let anyone get away! Are you sure? 100% Good luck. Malayali soldier Lt. Col. Krishnakumar who was shot dead by terrorists in Kashmir, gets final salutations from his hometown. Political and cultural leaders paid their last respects to Krishnakumar.... Yesterday, you had gone for the cremation, right? Who told you? - I saw it on a news channel. Nair sir and you, Jack. Was he someone close? Yes. Must be one of your friends, right? Why are you like this? A young man who hasn't even completed 3 years of married life... What did he die for? Was it for a property dispute between neighbours? He died for us! For our country, which includes you and me. What more of a relation should I have, to go and see him? Oh no! That was not what I meant... You must have seen all the drama that happened at his house on TV, right? This is usual in the house of every soldier who gets killed. There will be many people to build stages, and announce compensations through the mic. But who knows whether that family actually receives those compensations? Does anyone follow up on that? Why? They would have made the dead soldier's family pay for even that mic set's rent. And if they go to a Government office, believing these announcements & promises? Immediately they ask for certificates... to prove that they are the wife, son or heir... And so many such certificates! Apart from all that, asking sexual favours to the widow of the soldier, as well. Such compensations should be given directly at the dead soldier's house, right? That's the dignity and respect he deserves! Jack, I'm sorry. Indian Army... Even if Indian Army closes its eyes for a second, this country would be within someone else's clutches! Do you know that? There is no other country in this world that shows such ingratitude to soldiers. In all the other countries, soldiers are addressed as 'Sir'. We celebrate so many days here, right? Children's day, Parents' day, Fathers' day, Brothers' day... Valentine's day... Dogs' day... That day... This day... And now, even kissing day was celebrated. At least one political party... or a cultural leader, or someone like that.... Have they requested the people, to spend at least one day, or an hour, or at least even a minute, for these dead soldiers? Is anyone doing so? When a soldier is alive, he's just a fool who comes with alcohol on holidays, and brags! And once he dies? A mighty hero who sacrificed his life for the country! There ends the greatness of a soldier. In short... if a soldier has to be respected, either there should be a war, or he should lie dead! Brother... Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother! Come on! Get up! Jack! Brother! Brother!! I want to go to Papa. Papa! Papa! Uncle! You? - You got scared! You're so grown up and acting like kids? No! No! - Your saviour is here? Mummy!! Up! Up! Up! Papa, come on! Up! Up! Up! Get lost! All the education expenses of his children, and a job for his wife, our dear sister here... I promise you that all such support would be given to them, from my side, as an MLA. Believing all those promises, my sister-in-law did the rounds at many Government offices. Then ask MLA sir to do it. I can't do anything unless you bring the certificate I asked for. If you know how things are over here, you needn't do so many rounds. Money is not the only factor. There are other things too, right? You know, right? It became clear to her what value is given for a soldier's widow in this society. Suffering all that humiliation, she attempted suicide, along with her kids. No. For brother, first. Even then, fate defeated her. The children were saved, miraculously. But my sister-in-law left this world. Mummy! Mummy! See you, Father. Uncle, don't go! Come. Uncle, come! Uncle! The rest of my life, was for those children. For several others like them. Uncle! Sir... Enough. Let her leave. I'm sorry. You are my friend. That's why I got emotional, unknowingly. I understand. I value your friendship. See you tomorrow. This is my world! All the people here, are my own. Most of the people here are connected to defense in some way. Those who got injured in the army... Widows of some soldiers... Their children... and so many such people. This is a huge institution. Everyone has a job here. There are many institutions under this trust, which is spread over 130 acres of land. Come, I'll show you. These are food items being exported to all corners of the world. There are many such units working here. This is our stitching unit. Here, around 400 people are working, in 4 shifts. We make the best pickles in India here. We make everything that a human requires, over here. I'll show you some other time. Come. - Okay. Today is our day of remembrance for the martyred soldiers. Come. Krishnetta... This is Krishnettan. He is the authority here. This is Susmitha. I'll tell you the rest later. - Okay. Okay then. Son... Here's some Payasam. This is our grandma. Who is this? - This is Susmitha. I'll tell you the rest later. You little devil! This is a completely different world altogether, right? This place was instituted so that.... families of not even a single soldier who dedicated his life for the country, doesn't get orphaned. Uncle! Hi uncle! Let's go to uncle. - My brother's children. Come! Come! Uncle, lift me. - Careful! What's your name? I am Sooraj. He is Neeraj. Which grade are you studying in? I am in 3rd grade. He is in kindergarten. Whom do you want to be, when you grow up? I want to become an army officer. Me too! Around 2000 kids like them are studying here. Free education. Each kid who grows up learning from here... They can be engineers, doctors or even scientists... But they are all for the Indian Army. There's no caste, religion or any such discrimination over here. In every breath we take, there is only emotion in the minds of the people here. India! Hello? Shall we go on a trip? Where? It's a place you like, Su Do Ku. Pack clothes for a couple of days! But still... where are we going? Do you trust me? Yes. Really? - Yes. Okay. Then let's... Sir, you have to see this. That Jack is going to do something in Goa. Why do you feel so? No, sir. I checked his travel details. In 6 months, he has visited Goa 9 times. So he's planning something there. Sir, so what should we do now? First, book the flight bro! With your permission, sir. - Of course. Thank you, sir. Can I have the keys? Thank you. Your key. - Okay. Your room. This is mine. Okay. Welcome, Ma'am. Who is it? Yeah. Tell me. Jack is in the same hotel, in the same room, he stayed earlier. What about you? - In the opposite room. No! No! You better stay in his room. We need to know what his target is. That's very important. Okay, sir. Yes, come in. Come. Sit down, Su Do Ku. How did you know that it's me? Who else can come to this room so confidently? What are you looking at? Just like that... I was looking if Goa has changed. And do you see any changes? - Some small changes. A bridge has come up. So the ways are all easier now. What ways? - Ways for people to come and go. There's a speciality that's unique to Goa. This place tells us, 'Go and come back'! How? - Go & 'a' (Come). Oh God! So I'll go and come back. - You're leaving? Do one thing. Take rest in your room. Or you can sit here if you want to. I will sit here. This room is more spacious. Are you going to play football? Well, where are you going? Anyway you're going to play football here, right? I'll go out and come. See you! Bye! Jack! Jack! Tell me! Sir, Jack had given a van to a workshop to strengthen its platform, a week back. He has planned to load something heavy in it. What's the colour of the van? - White. SIr, Jack had booked this godown a month back itself, for tomorrow. What's the size of that godown? Sir, around 25,000 square feet. Okay. Sir, I am at a travel agency now. Jack had booked 24 cars for tomorrow, one month back. Okay. Van... Godown... 24 cars... Do you feel any connection? Any clue? No, sir. But one thing is for sure. Something is going to happen tomorrow. Because, tomorrow is the only day... for which he has booked that godown. Hello Ma'am. Stitched dresses are ready. Thank you. IBM bank. Yes, Susmitha. Tell me. Sir, 4 security uniforms were stitched and brought to Jack's room now. When I checked it secretly, it has IBM bank's logo on it. And when I looked through the binocular which Jack looked through, without changing its focus, IBM Bank was in focus. Okay, Susmitha. Thank you so much. I'll talk to you later. Okay, sir. Now we have a new clue. Bank - IBM. Four uniforms. That means, he has four people to help him as well. Wait! Wait! Wait! He is really intelligent. What if it is his idea to track us? What do you think? No, sir. I don't think so. - Yeah? - No. But why bank? His target is black money, right? But sir, he can even steal white money, right? Moreover, it's outside Kerala too. But the possibilities are very less. There's something connected with IBM. Please sit down. - Thank you, sir. You want to have some coffee or something? - No, sir. Thank you. As a guest of Goan Malayali association, this is the 5th time I'm coming here. Koyapparamban! 23 years back, for the inauguration of this association... What is he doing here? Sir, a black money transaction is going to happen at Hotel Rwanda tomorrow. Jack told me that it's a commission being given to Minister Koyapparamban, in a deal with a Kuwait company. I had informed this to S.I. Hari. What I took yesterday was the advance Koyapparamban received.. from the Kuwait business deal. I'll take the balance amount as well. Yes, Daniel. Tell me. - Sir... Home Minister has reached Goa. Any information about his visit? I've got some information from a reliable source. He is here for a deal. I heard that black money is also involved in it. Can you do an enquiry and tell me, sir? How, Daniel? Even if I ask, would he tell me? Anyway, let me see. - Philip! Yes, sir. Check at all star hotels if any business oriented companies from Kuwait, have reached Goa. Sure, sir. - It's a priority, okay? Hello! You won't give me peace of mind even here? I doubt whether you're taking all my money, by sniffing behind me all the time. Sir... - Then what? Why do you care what I came here for? I got information that the thief we're looking for, is in Goa. Who? The one you can't catch? This is Goa, man! Goa! To do something to me here, he has to be born twice again! I've assigned my protection to Thunder Force. For the time being, I don't need help from you or your lousy policemen! Understood? - Tell me, sir. Daniel... - Sir... He's not saying anything. He hung up, after cursing Kerala Police a lot. I'm sorry, sir. - Okay, I'll call you. Sir... Sir, these Kuwait people are staying in Hotel Meridien. And Home Minister is staying at the guest room, in the cultural centre. Are you sure? - Yes, sir. Yes! Yes! Yes! Now the picture is clear. Maybe this is my assumption. But I'm sure... The money that's coming from overseas for Home Minister Koyapparamban, is stored in IBM bank's chest. They are the ones who do such transactions. See, probably, tomorrow this money would reach Koyapparamban's hands. He has reached Goa to collect it. Then why are the vans arranged, sir? See, usually the bank's van is used to shift large amounts of money. But Jack has decided to use his van in place of them. That's why he changed the colours of the vans, and made their bases stronger. What about those 28 cars? Maybe to divert the money to 28 places. Then godown? He will be dividing the money to the cars over there. - Okay. See, if we have to catch him red-handed, we shouldn't block him until he goes inside, gets the money & comes out. We should keep watching him silently. - Yes, sir. Jack... Shall we go back? Why? I don't know... Let's go. Tonight itself. Let's go. Is it okay if we go after tomorrow? I don't know. I somehow feel so. What do you feel? Why have we come here actually? How do I say all that to a police officer? Police? - Yeah. You are a police officer. I know it, from the beginning. How? So simple. Do you remember? That day... ... when those people came & put a knife to your neck, demanding 50,000 Rupees? Suddenly when I turned back, I saw you trying to move your hand to your back to take a gun, and later dropping that plan. That moment I realized, you are an informer. From the State, or Central force. I'm sorry. It's okay. Come. Hey! Don't worry. I can read your mind. Then you should go back. Otherwise you'll be caught. Us soldiers... If we take a step forward, we never go back. In case we step back, it would be to go 3 steps forward. So, be cool. You do your job. I will do mine. Anyway.... See you in the morning. Good night. Hey Sudoku! Still, I value you... and your friendship. From my heart! Jack? Hello, sir. - What's happening? Sir, Jack just went out, disguised as a Sardar. Follow him. - Yes, sir. Follow that vehicle. - Okay, Madam. Brother, please don't miss it. Philip.. - Sir? Something else is happening! What, sir? I don't know. Sir... Yes? - The van is coming. Sir... Stop here. Oh God! Call Susmitha. - Yeah. Sir, not reachable. Try again. - Okay. Same again. Okay. Do one thing. Track where she got her last call from. Sure, sir. Sujith, Philip here. Please track this number. 7907910047. I need to know the location from which the last call came on this number. As soon as possible. Over! Copy. Philip Sir.... Yeah. Tell me. 5 kms away from Panjim tower area... Lalit Museum. That is the exact location. Is any event happening at Lalit Museum? Or something like that?

Some more presence, man! Where did the alarm go on? More presence over there. All eyes open, man! Okay! And keep the crowd calm! Keep the crowd calm! Don't let them panic. Y'all don't panic.

Jack, what are you doing here? I took it. God! What the hell are you doing, Jack? Do you know what consequences this would have? I thought only about you. You told me your desire. So I stole this. Are you mad? I was just kidding then. Is this why you didn't leave yesterday, when I asked about leaving? What do I do with this now? Susmitha! Catch him! I'm sorry, Jack. You are under arrest. Sorry, Sudoku. See you later! Sorry sir... Sir... Sir! Arun, clear the vehicle! Rest of you, follow me. Come on! Oh no! Hello sir! - Hey Philip! Where are you? Sir, I'm running. - Okay. Crown Tower, Panjim. 22nd floor. Gather all the media, and come here fast. Sir, media will be ready. Philip! - Tell me, sir. Have you reached? Sir, we are on the way. - How long will you take? 5 minutes, sir. 5 minutes? - Yeah. Come fast. Okay, sir. Where will you run now? That's what I'm also looking. Okay, come. I'll come after 5 minutes. I'll come after 5 minutes! Yeah! Okay. I am coming! I'm on the way! What is he doing here? Don't let him go out, at any cost! If he goes out, we will be behind bars! Finish him off! Yes, sir. - Jack! This evidence is enough! Your game is over! Aren't these your men? - No. Then whose? Home Minister Koyapparamban's men. Sir! Koyapparamban sir! - Oh God! Come out! I know very well that you are behind this! Come out! Jack! What's all the commotion here? What are you doing here? What is all this, sir? Didn't you see what it is? Anyway, good that you came. These boxes have to be taken to Kerala soon. Let there be full escort! I have to give this to many ministers! Hello! Excuse me! First tell me what's happening here. Whom does this money belong to? Can't you understand by seeing it? We are packing our money. Shut up! - What? Answer my question properly! Why is he like this? I'm fed up of you! If you're not understanding what I'm saying, I'll call someone who'll make you understand! CM!! Look who's here! What? - You brought him, right? Now talk to him! His mom is from Palakkad! What is this, sir? All ministers of Kerala are here? I was told that you had gone to Mumbai, sir. Bombay! From there I'm going back home, via Goa. Didn't you hear what he said? Don't talk unnecessary things. Let things proceed. Why are you also talking like this, sir? I can't do all that. It's illegal. You don't have to bother about all that. I'll handle it. No, sir. I can't do this. Do you remember, sir? You said that I should seize all this black money the next time we meet, right? That's what I'm doing now. But I never thought that it would happen so soon. You don't have to talk too much. If you don't obey me, I will dismiss you. I'm the Chief Minister of the State. - I am the Home Minister. Otherwise, I'll dismiss you. - No, sir. I am IPS. You can't do that. Only the President or the Prime Minister can dismiss me. What do we do then? Sir! All medias ready! Oh no! Media! Everything is over! - See! Come! Come! Excuse me. Daniel sir. Please ask. See! See! Can't you see? It's a black money transaction. Our honourable Kerala Chief Minister will answer you. There! He's all yours. Philip! - Yes, sir. Just tell me one thing. - Yeah! How did you know that I was here? Didn't you call me and ask me to bring the media & police to the 22nd floor? 2 times you called me! - What are you saying? When did I call you? When I called from downstairs, you said, 'Coming. I'm on the way'. Coming? - Yeah. Okay. I'm coming. Jack! But the voice was in your style, sir. - It's him. He is capable. - No, sir. I don't believe that. But, good you came! Thank you, sir. I appreciate it. I was just going by this way... That's when this... Sir! A letter from Jack! Daniel sir, In your eyes, I've always been a criminal. So you won't believe me, whatever I say. Taking the diamond was not my goal. My intention was to bring you here, sir. Keeping something back, is tougher than stealing it. So, I've put the necklace inside Susmitha's bag. You'll return it, right? Anyway, thanks for everything. Jack. Sir, we need evidence, right? Can't we use this as evidence? We can arrest him with this. This letter? - Yes. See! It's a magic ink. If exposed to wind, the ink will vanish in 30 seconds. Hi. I'm Soumya from Goa Malayali news. - Brilliant guy! A black money hunt of an amount unheard of Kerala's political history is happening here. Jack! Black money worth 2000 Crores was seized by the team led by... CBI Officer Daniel Alexander & DYSP Philippose. Philip! - Sir! The diamond & the Rs.2000 Crore cash are in our custody. Leaving all this here, do you think Jack would go empty handed? Hello, all clear. Please, please go. Not you. You should wait. You can go! Sir... I can help you out. But you should say the truth. Tell me correctly. Actually how much did you get? Tell him the truth. His mom is from Palakkad. 4000 Crores. 2000 Crores is here. Balance 2000 Crores is in an ambulance, underground. It's not there. Jack! What's he going to do with a sack? - Phil. - Sir... Inform the Governor's office, to get the permission to arrest these gentlemen. Good luck, sir. His mom's house won't be in Palakkad! Hi. Good morning, Jack. - Hi sir. What a beautiful place! Congrats, sir. The whole of India is talking about you now. The State Government was resolved, and a re-election was held. Because of you only! India's most courageous officer! Isn't that a bit too much? You fooled the State Government and stole 2000 Crores! Cool. How did you woo my assistant so easily? Come, all of you! Have you come to arrest me now, sir? Look, Mr. Jack.... I have arrested all those who had to be arrested. Indians for Indian Army. What a beautiful concept! If you're not there, who else do they have? Anyway... My job here is over. Before I leave, this is for you. Good luck to you. Central Health Minister - 5000 Crores. Punjab. Sir! Are you going to join me? Hi Phil.... - Sir... I'm really happy to have worked with you. - Thank you, sir. Then, one important thing. - Yes, sir. Convey my regards to all your girlfriends! Sir...!! Didn't you say that you stopped everything? How can I stop, sir? There's no end to the growth of black money! Sir, we couldn't catch him even after working so hard! What can we do! There's no proof! Where is your next mission? Punjab. Where is your next posting, sir? Punjab! See you soon!
