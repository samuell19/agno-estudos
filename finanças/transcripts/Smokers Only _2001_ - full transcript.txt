Did you forget something? Thanks. I wasn't paying attention. I get paid when I am working. You still owe me something. Will you give it back to me? Come get it. Won't you give it back to me? Come and get it. I like you. I don't pay to make love. And for someone you don't love? Too bad. If you want your card, look for me at the ATM places. I'll wait. You don't have the code. 76-89-04. What? You don't trust me? You don't trust me. Why should I trust you? Why not? To report the loss of your card, press "3". Please enter your I.D. Card Number. Now, enter your new code. Violeta, you tell her? Reni... One finds that... if a team doesn't work, it's necessary to find a solution. Yes, that's correct. What can one do? This week-end? Another? No, that's something one doesn't speak about and that's the root of the problem. There's a person on the team, since it is a team, that's not working well. Don't you think so? Yes, I spoke to Violeta and I thought perhaps that person was you. - Me? - Considering we never change location... I didn't say that. The problem doesn't come from him. Violeta, tell her what you think. As you told me. Reni, I find that... I don't know. Sometimes you sing bizarrely. It's simple. After the singing, I got asked: ''Who sang?'' I would say: ''Reni.'' ''Who's that?'' You want me to sing? A pack of ten. Here's someone, the Armenian. One that makes you go up the sky. Reni, listen to me. We need to talk. You're always repeating yourself. You... You don't sing alone. I also sing. And you, you let yourself... - Why give yourself airs? - I don't know. I assert myself naturally. And then at this moment, I sing better. That will come. You sang as if it were your own show. I don't know. We can change. We improvise, don't we? No, we repeat the same things over. But some people take it to their heads. Me, I find that's better. All right. I will keep a note All right, good day. The Armenian, the guys... Come. There's a problem. The old man with the BM stole his watch. Someone dressed in black. Who's in black? You! Am I the only one dressed in black? - You accuse me? - No, I don't accuse you. Then shut up! He puts it in the bottom. I will have five more by tomorrow. Is that so! What an idiot! Where is it, your mountain house? About ten minutes' drive. But snow chains are necessary since there's a lot of snow and it is slippery. Will you take me there? Of course, Andr?s! We need to set up a date. But I am not equipped. That's nothing. We'll do some shopping on the day we leave, and you'll buy everything necessary. It's as simple as that. Not right away, but... we'll go soon, don't you worry. Make yourself at home. It's small, but it's not costly. You didn't change the code. You noticed? Yes, I noticed. Didn't take a penny from you. Did you like that? What? What you saw. And you, you liked that? I can do that better. Here, everyone can see you. Doesn't that bother you? You like it very much, to be looked at? I don't pay to make love, I told you before. Why did you come, then? I don't know. I wanted to see you. Is that true? Should we get out? I like the city like that, the emptiness, the night. It's not empty. For me, it is. And what's that, then? A hologram? - That doesn't count. - Why is that? You press a button and it disappears. You're wrong. You get 20 points if you aim it at a victim. There's a kiosk there. Go buy. See that? He doesn't disappear. It's shit. At day time, it is worse. There's a lot people, a lot of scum. At least, at night, they are hidden. The night overflows. One needs to get used to the dark, that's all. I have to go. See you again? - Where? - You know where. That one? Which one? She was at the ATM's. Let me tell you. She seems crazy, but she is sympathetic. It's not getting anywhere. You need to pay. That's at least 500. That's wasted. Go, come on. ARE YOU AT THE ATM'S OR JUST DREAMING? Did you know if one doesn't budge, one is not immobile? One can travel millions of light-years. You are my travel companion. Then this pizzeria would be a spaceship? And the Lavalle Street would be the Galaxy. I don't know if I am your travel companion. How's that? I only know, that I am the Dragon. - And me, the Serpent. - Liar! You look more like a Rabbit to me. That's true. But I would like to be the Serpent. You don't like what you are. Me, perhaps. Fire Dragon. Another epoch... what an epoch! The Golden Age. One does a number with a duck. A wild duck. One makes love with the duck. It's a miracle. It spoke, it sang... Where did you know them from? It danced with us. They are my friends. But from where? My customers. Both of them? Yes, both. One is almost like engaged. I take you along to the theater, to eat... I'll be a little whore, for you. Reni, I have one more round. Are we ready? Just about. Just like that, I am not flying. And now, darling? A little love? You're strange. Wild. When I sing, people say that. Do you sing? - In a group. - Great! But I will stop, there are a lot of problems. It gets complicated. I would like to come and see you. You can. You alone? For now. For now. And your family? I don't have a family. I am the fruit of a genetic experiment. I came out of a bottle. You have any friends? The members of your group? The test-tubes. How do you make your living? The laboratory that made me provides for me. They send cheques to me. And once every week, I must take the tea. We could do something together. We could go to the river one day. One day? I didn't know you live during the day. During the day, I am in the laboratory that made me. I clean the bottles and the test-tubes. So then! I will kill you. I'm a little hungry. Me too. We buy something to eat? I don't have money, do you? I go back now. It's not the pain. What's the matter with you? - Any problem? - I don't want you to go. I'll have to go all the same. What's the matter with you? An act of dignity? Are you like that? Just for the present... You are shit, son of a whore. You'll continue to suck cocks and eat pizzas that have the taste of sperm? Not pizza, not shit, not puff, not sorrentino... Look at yourself. You disgust me. And you know what? You will end up all alone. Here, take it. I changed the code. I give it back to you, so you don't have to look for me everywhere. Don't give my number to anyone. It will be the end of me. This is Andr?s, for Reni. And Reni, how can she call Andr?s? Here, there's a chip... You see the small button on the pager? You press on it... and it rings. Reni calls, I must answer. One would say an octopus... with thousands of tentacles. It's a monster. It makes you desire useless things. To consume, to want. To spend. Me, I want a portable one to be connected permanently. Want me to be connected too? In full shift... Why telephone in full shift? I look at stars and I do not know their names. I look at trees and I do not know their names. I want to go far away. To really wish for something, even if a small thing. But to wish for something and to be sure of it. Would you like to go anywhere? Far away. Me also, I want to leave. If you don't look far, you can become short-sighted. That happens to prisoners. As they are always enclosed by four walls, they become short-sighted. And they don't see the monster, the totality; they see the small ends, the pieces. Have you never feared? I pay attention, all the time. - I'm not talking about that. - What are you talking about? To fall in love, to fall in love with you. That thing... moreover... With my customers,, I never speak of love. You like that, don't you? You're pleased with that? That? Yes. It's true, I like that. I am pleased with that. Especially when they pay me. I don't know how to describe it. Everything has a price. The pizza, 7 pesos. This beer, 3. The rollers, 90. And Andr?s, 150. If you don't have a price, you have nothing to offer. You have no value. I am pleased that I have value, that I am appreciated, that I am liked. I am like that. Me also, I want. What do you want? Nothing. That, same as you. Same if even for one day. You can't. You, I think, I am sure, your mother told you to live free. My mother told me that I looked like Ornella Mutti. She lied. I don't care. Me, I want to be... like Cicciolina. The porn star? In Italy, she was chosen as the best. She did strange things on TV. She showed a breast. Of all strange things... Do I resemble her? Show your breast. That's it. Uncover yourself. Uncover yourself a bit. That's it. Very well. You turn over. That's it. You see? You caress yourself a little. Touch yourself. A little higher. That's it. Very well. That's it. Turn over, bend back. - Like that? - Yes. Watch your belly-button. That's it, very good. Did you like that? Are you taking me somewhere? Do we go together? Why are you staring at me, then? Very well. You do it well. I stumbled. She must speak to me. What good would that do? I don't know how it works. Try it. What? You are beautiful to crunch. Can't I be there? Let's say I am a customer. Go ahead, seduce me. What do you want? Do you like me? If you give me 25%, I do it. It's me who discovered you. That pleased her, the bitch. I don't know, we shall see. I feel very well. Yes, I can see that. One wouldn't say it is the first time. Are they saying it is the first time? An obscure past... I don't believe it. Do you like it, then? You feel that you have the capacity. We should celebrate your initiation. Do you think they will choose me? I don't know. It's the moment of truth. One always wants to please. We'll see how much you are worth. That I wanted it, is not enough for you? On my planet, everyone goes through there. But few ever come back. I don't know, I see myself in that glance. One looks at it and recognizes oneself. But you, you make me doubt. You must be mixed. How's that? Why did you come today? I wanted to wake up and see if I would be different tomorrow. To see if I would be a different person after tonight. Why did you say I was mixed? Come! Did you like that? I liked that. That was good, wasn't it? - It was novel? - It was novel. It was novel. I am pleased that it was novel. You can stay the whole night? It would cost you more. That's not a problem. No problem? You can't leave. He's the type that wants them to remain all night long. I'll go. I've finished my service. You can earn a lot of money. Is that true? Keep this. He wants us to stay. It is necessary to stay until the end. I am going crazy. It is finished. I want to go. - Where will you go? - I don't know. I'll just walk. Would that do? She has left. - The girl left. - How's that? - She had to go. - But... She can't stay. She had things to do. And then? Then... Me, I stay. Just you? We can do something else. We don't need her. We can try. Let us see... Don't touch me! What's the matter with you? Tell me your fantasies. Look at me. I want to see you. You see me. Touch me. I am now more with the group? You want to continue? But I cannot do that all over again. It makes me tired. In the past, it wouldn't tire me. But... Yesterday, I wrote and I didn't like it. I trashed it all. Violeta wants to sing. Yes, she wants to sing. But one must see. One doesn't decide to go on or not. One just goes on, that's all. Me, at this moment... I am somewhere else. Where are you? You remember how we started? When we were invited to an an alternative concert in Zona Sur? Ended up playing in a bazaar at Villa Domenico. One wouldn't think it would last such a long time. It is strange, isn't it? Everything which came to be started from something... Will that someone go away? And will we continue to exist without this someone? It is sad... and it is not sad. DO YOU FEEL LONELY? WHEN YOU CANNOT SLEEP CAN YOU TELL ME YOUR NIGHTMARES? Today, I don't want to work. I know a perfect place where we can be alone. It's out of this world. Fifty Eskimos has a meeting and invented an artificial reflector that lights up the moon. Like an artificial sun. For four consecutive days, it illuminated everyone in a radius of 235 km. They invented it so as to track down people. But there is nobody in the Arctic. I would like to go there. Me too. A nomadic tribe, in Mongolia, the ?aka, they are overlapping, they catch wild eagles to use for hunting, and after training them, they release them. I saw a report on monkeys. On Discovery? Yes. But it was sad. I prefer those on birds. You are hurting me. But I believe that it is good. You also, you hurt me. And I don't know if it is good. I don't want to forget you. Yet I don't want to be missing you. Baby! How's that? The money! - Three hundred? - Yes. Wait. - Take it. - Great! - Easy money. - It's good to have fun as well. What's that noise? Your pager? - Who was that? - I don't know. It's nobody. You sure that it's not something? Checking. The code? 76-89-04. That's all there is to it. Come, Charly is waiting for us. I PAY YOU 500 PESOS I DO THAT I PAY NOT FOR MAKING LOVE NOR FOR WORK... BUT WILL YOU TELL ME YOUR NIGTHMARES? You brought the money? What are you doing? You climb in with your rollers? I already told you, don't doubt that I walk the same ground as you. That's it, Astroboy. Get in. You don't like that, Astroboy? What have you? Dignity? That doesn't interest me. I believe that's not important. It brings problems, causes complications. Dignity? What dignity? I have no dignity. I always say yes. Yes for everything. Afterwards, I don't know. Afterwards, I go away. - I don't like you to say that. - Why not? - It's sad. - It is you who is sad. We are not the same. You believe in your own essence. I don't believe in my own essence. It is simpler than that. I take. He who wants to go to the 7th sky, will fall. I am not essential, I am expensive. I have a technique for dreaming. It goes like this. I think of something I like and I try to dream. What do you think of? I imagine a situation, a place The sea. A house on the beach. The pines. There is nobody. Me, I cook. I look at the sea. I look out the window and... And me, I open the door. I bring you flowers. A lot of flowers. You gathered them on the way. They are not garden grown. No, for us, there is no garden. I flew with the neighbors. I jumped over the fence, the dog barked... I ran and I collected as many flowers as possible. It is night. One will swim. One makes a heap of promises. One promises oneself the sea for always, the house on the beach, the pines and the garden. I never promised you a garden. And you lied. No, I do not lie. You lied. It doesn't matter. Happy birthday. Should we swim? We can't, the water's polluted.
