We walk down the street and we see all these houses. And all these houses have some kind of brick. And you have to understand the magnitude of work when you realize that each one of those bricks was touched by a human hand. There's no machine that lays bricks at this point. ♪ jazzy bass plucking ♪ And you realize that every one of those bricks was put down by hand. A hand, a man that fought, fed, well, he worked, he went to bed, he had a family, he had a life and this hand put that brick down. And you look around and you see all those bricks and you realize how people have worked. Relationships between people. Relationships between people and things. One on one, man and woman, groups, they're all part of the things that I deal with. They're all touched by human beings. For instance, I went into the uh, in the New York Public Library. There was this door, where one door knob... this big massive oak door... one door knob is shiny and bright and the other one is dull. Why is that? Because that's the one that people pull open and use and over the years it has become different than the one that's not used. And that fascinated me. Now nobody understands that when I take the picture, but I understand it. But from that... from knowing that... I look for it in other things. So that picture may not be a success in that sense but it kind of cues me in to other things. So then I look at steps and if you look at steps whether they're marble or wood they're worn and they get a lovely patina. You see all these steps, these people, day in and day out. You look at the subway steps, day in and day out people walk up and down those steps without thinking about it, yet those steps were put there by men. They're used by man, you know? And they take a little piece of that step home with them on the sole of their shoe. That's fantastic! Do you realize that? I mean under your shoe! There are microcosms of that material, that step. And all the bullshit and shit that you walk on in the street also go with them. But I mean, this is the way I think and this is the way, uh, some of these things I want to be in the work, I mean which is impossible. But who said we shouldn't try to do the impossible? ♪ angular string music ♪ Thank you for calling the St. Louis Housing Authority.

Uh the psychology of have... of to... of experiencing those sorts of things. Yeah, 'cause in some ways um I think parts of what I'm talking about is what goes on in one's head um at the time and I try... I mean it's a difficult line to walk that, uh, the work doesn't promote a kind of victimization uh and I don't mean to support that but it's more the feeling and the sensation and the psychology of experiencing those sorts of things. and kind of emptiness... it's that grey area... it's more the feeling and the sensation... You've got two new communities here that you're working on today. We're at Green Tree Meadows. Tell us a little about that. Why is this such a phenomenal community? Well it's a nice, it's a nice area Lake St. Louis and uh, our, the Green Tree Meadows uh has uh, we have a hundred and nineteen lots here uh available, we have three displays and uh all of the uh lots are on cul-de-sacs. There's just one entrance in and one out so that makes it, you know, nice and secure that way. We're, we wrap around the uh, elementary school here and uh, Wentzville triple A rated school district. Yeah that's a top-rated school district. And there's a walking trails from each cul-de-sac that, that adjoin uh the school trails which adjoins the city park of Lake St. Louis. Uh, you have to ask yourself, when you look at any metropolitan area, who gets to make the region-wide decisions about how money is spent, where is the clout in this area, where are the calls being made about public infrastructure investment and in whose interest? Sir, where did you come from in the back, did you just get on? Where are you from? St. Louis? I was in St. Louis four times, I ate at the McDonald's in St. Louis. Near the, near the Arch. You ate there too? Near the train station, the Greyhound station, I went on Amtrak to St. Louis. Oh, yes, meet me in St. Louie Louie... oh yeah, Louie Louie... It's like coming home to a vacation. In the single-family section, we could have put twice as many homes but we wanted every home site to back to trees and that happened. In our single family attached units, we have a hundred and one home sites on 60 acres so there's a lot of common ground, a lot of beauty to it... There are several ways to lay bricks when building a brick wall. One way is called the American common bond. I'm not sure what to make of that, but I do find it interesting. Then close to here we have golf courses, Six Flags, parks everywhere, and this has to be one of the prettiest developments we have ever... ♪ curious string plucking ♪ There are several ways to lay bricks when building a brick wall. One way is called the American common bond. I'm not sure what to make of that, but I do find it interesting. I was reading a glossary from a preservation plan for St. Louis. One of the terms that I came across, was story, which it defined as the space between any two floors of a building. Reading that, it of course occurred to me that between any two floors of any given building, there are a multitude of stories. Another term in the glossary was return, which it defined as an architectural element that extends from one exterior surface to another. My story is about a different kind of return but it is related to architecture. It has to do with my return to the city of St. Louis after a prolonged absence. I suppose that I hadn't been back in the city for very long when I had a dream that I only recently remembered and the dream was about a memory, so I guess you could say that this is a memory, of a dream, of a memory. In the dream, and in the memory, I was about seven years old and I was in bed at night sleeping when I awoke to the sound of my father snoring. I laid there for some time in the dark listening to my father snore. It occurs to me now that the sound was a bit like I imagine one would hear if the night were able to breath. I listened for as long as I was able and then drifted back to sleep. Perhaps I had this dream because by the time of my return to St. Louis, my father had long since passed away. When I saw that the city had also passed away, I must have felt that the night had somehow learned to breath and all that remained was the sound of that breathing.
