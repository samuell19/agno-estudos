STATE FUNERAL Moscow calling! This is a special bulletin from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the USSR, Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. To all Party members, to all the working people of the USSR! Dear comrades and friends! The Central Committee of the Communist Party, Council of Ministers and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, with the deepest sorrow inform the Party and all the working people of the USSR that on March 5, at 9.50 pm, the Chairman of Council of Ministers of the USSR, the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the USSR, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin passed away after a serious illness. The heart of Lenin's comrade-in-arms, and visionary follower of Lenin's cause, the wise leader of the Communist Party and the Soviet people, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, has stopped beating. Medical report on the cause of death of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin. On the night of March 2, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin suffered a haemorrhage in the left hemisphere of the brain, caused by hypertension and arteriosclerosis. This resulted in a paralysis of the right side of the body, and loss of consciousness. On the first day of the illness, breathing difficulty occurred due to the damage to the nervous system. The condition worsened day by day. The breathing pattern was irregular, with prolonged temporary stops, so-called Cheyne-Stokes respiration. On the night of March 3, respiratory arrests became life-threatening. From the onset of illness, the following cardiovascular disorders were diagnosed: high blood pressure, rapid and irregular heartbeat, atrial fibrillation and dilated cardiomyopathy. Oxygen deficiency caused by the deterioration of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems was observed on March 3. From the first day of illness, the patient had high fever and leukocytosis, possible symptoms of lung infection. On the last day of illness, the condition deteriorated rapidly resulting in acute heart failure and collapse. ECG test revealed acute restriction of the blood flow in the coronary artery and damage to the heart muscle. In the afternoon of March 5, the patient's condition deteriorated rapidly. Fast and shallow breathing was observed, heartbeat rate increased to 140-150 bpm, the pulse force decreased. At 21 hours 50 minutes, due to cardiovascular... and respiratory failure, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin died. Our first day without Stalin, it's the day when he is gone. Death has come, and everything is useless. Death has come - and we are all alone. The Soviet people promise to work tirelessly in order to fulfill Stalin's cause and to build Communism. Long live Stalin's immortal cause! Long live the great Soviet people, Communism builders, who will live to see the triumph of Communism! Stalin is dead, long live Stalin! Our Father passed away, our hearts are full of sadness: He'll never shake a comrade's hand again, but to his people he has left his genius, his heart of steel forever will remain! The sacred banners carried by the comrades, a road full of hardships lies ahead, the Central Committee, invincible and glorious, will overcome and will defy his death! When all of us, we saw him in his coffin, and said good-bye and paid our last respects, We knew his might... but how softened his features now, as he's laid to rest. We knew he was the best on our planet, victorious in every battle, every war, to think of other people was his tenet, his heart was selfless to the core. This tragedy has brought us close together, as no joyful day has ever done, we stand united, holding hands forever, we serve our Stalin, we are all as one. It's impossible to take your eyes off this infinitely dear face. Your eyes are full of tears, you hold your breath, you are overwhelmed with sorrow, shared by millions, hundreds of millions of people. I look and look again. I won't stop looking. For the first time in my life, with all my heart, with all my mind I grasp this mysterious word: "immortality". This is it! Immortality. It is true, Joseph Vissarionovich passed away. It's true that his heart stopped beating. His warm and passionate heart. His heart, devoted to the people. His motionless head rests on the pillow. Never again will a genius thought be born in it. His lips are sealed tight under his moustache. Never again will they utter his carefully considered words. And yet, there is no death here! So many precious thoughts were born in his genius brain! So many wise words, inspiring millions of people, were uttered by these lips. So much love! Overwhelming, life-giving love for mankind was given to the world by this daring and courageous heart, that there is no room left for the word "death"! There is no death here! There is only eternal life! Immortality! Stalin's immortality is in his deeds. It is in Communism, that we shall achieve. We shall certainly achieve it, for Stalin taught us how to! People bring more and more wreaths to the coffin. A wreath of fresh tulips, interwoven with ammodendron and saxaul branches. A wreath of dark-green fresh branches, wide and shiny magnolia leaves. A wreath of heavy, golden stalks of ripened wheat, it lies glaring, decorated with silk ribbons. A wreath of stainless steel, bronze and brass. Pointed palm leaves, golden arrows of laurels and mighty bronze of oak leaves and acorns. He gave us his advice. He helped us grow. He was everywhere. He was always with us. Every child knew his name from birth, and cherished it as a keepsake. His name, which is so dear to us, which is so dear to all mankind, his name continues to shine and to illuminate our road to Communism, just as it illuminated our entire lives. This name is immortal. So long as mankind lives, it shall be illuminated by the light of this life-giving and immortal genius. It'll take us a long time to come to terms with these plain and cruel words: "Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin's heart has stopped beating." We were so full of love for him, our life was enriched with his genius, which he shared not only with the millions of compatriots, but also with the people abroad. We don't have the right to be weak. We are not ashamed of our tears and of our sorrow. In our sorrow is the strength of love. The happiness he gave us, will stay with us. It will live in us, just as his beautiful and glorious image will remain with us forever. We'll always remember his infinite kindness, the way he cared for our Soviet people. His selfless love for the Soviet people, for every single one of us, will live in us. The great happiness of building the universal and the wonderful happiness of Communism! We swear by Stalin's glorious memory, we promise to our Mother, the Communist Party, that our whole life, our every deed and every thought, will belong to our great Party, to its great teachings, to the great cause of building Communism! We will remember his every word... We despise death, there will be no death... The man, who brought precious gifts to millions people around the world who turned a human into such a strong, noble and honourable being, as it has never been seen in the history of mankind. It's not true that he is no longer with us! He is with us! In our every deed, in every drop of blood, that runs through our veins, in every breath we take, lives the gift of Stalin, the gift he gave to humanity, the way to the great, bright and universal future, to Communism! We address the entire mankind! Long live the great and invincible banner of Lenin and Stalin! Long live Communism, the embodiment of our leader's eternal life! You were with us through all the wars and hardships. You nurtured us, you kept a watchful eye, your toast in honour of the ordinary Russians opened up our hearts and made us laugh and cry. We celebrated Victory like birthday, we started our lives as if anew. You know that true love is never worldly, but it is as pure as morning dew. The sun of your ideas shines above us and Moscow stars are bright with crimson light. Dear Comrade, your every wish is our command, and we shall work for you, and we shall fight! And from my heart these simple words are coming. Today I'm very happy to report, that all mankind is led by Lenin-Stalin, and there is no honour higher in this world. Comrade Stalin made his way through the snowy planes of Donbass. The devastated people heard his voice: "Hurry to the rescue of Ukraine!" I can see the miners of Donbass, thousands of people who met him in the trenches, and water-filled mines, at the destroyed factories. Everywhere he came, the stars began to shine and the iron ore began to flow. He united all the lands of Ukraine. Young pioneers, sombre and stern, salute with their shaking hands. Their eyes fill with tears, but their lips whisper an oath, with confidence and determination, to Lenin, to Stalin, and the Communist Party. Moscow schoolchildren as guards of honour stand at Stalin's coffin. There's no end to our pain and sorrow and no words to utter how much we grieve. Oh, Comrade Stalin... we don't have words, but we have hearts to give. Without words, in every town or village, to add one minute to your precious life we would have given all our blood. If we could bring together all of them, all those hearts with their silent passion, and give them all to you, you would have lived another hundred years, you would have lived, you would. But, Comrade Stalin, you have left us. And no words to utter pain and grief. The face of Earth is grey. Its soul weeps.

The floor is given to the Chairman of Council of Ministers of the USSR, the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the USSR, Comrade Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov. Dear compatriots, comrades and friends! Dear foreign brothers! Our Party, the Soviet people and the entire mankind have suffered a terrible, irreplaceable loss. The glorious life of our teacher and leader, of the greatest genius in the history of mankind, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin has ended. During these days of mourning, our sorrow is shared by progressively minded people all over the world. The greatness and the importance of Comrade Stalin's deeds are immense in the eyes of the Soviet people and the workers of the entire world. Stalin's deeds will live forever, and future generations, full of gratitude, as we do now, will hail Stalin's name. Comrade Stalin dedicated his life to the cause of the liberation of the proletariat and working people from exploitation by the oppressors; to the cause of ridding humankind of devastating wars; to the cause of achieving happy and free life on earth for the working people. Stalin succeeded in finding a solution for one of the most complex problems in the history of development of human society, the national question. Having developed the greatest national question theory, for the first time in history, Comrade Stalin eliminated centuries-long ethnic hostility within the boundaries of our vast, multiethnic state. As a result of Comrade Stalin's tireless toils, according to his plans, our Party managed to transform a backward country into a powerful, industrially and agriculturally developed state; it established a new economic order, free of economic depressions and unemployment. Our sacred duty is to ensure further development of our socialist Motherland. We must make every effort to develop socialist industry, the stronghold of our country's power and strength. We must make every effort to strengthen collective farms: to achieve prosperity and development of all the collective farms of our Soviet country. We must strengthen the union between workers and peasants. People from all over the world know Comrade Stalin, as the greatest torchbearer for the cause of world peace. Comrade Stalin dedicated the power of his genius to safeguarding peace for the people of all countries. Soviet foreign policy, the policy of peace and friendship between nations, is crucial for restraining foreign military aggression, and it is conducted in the best interests of all nations. The great Stalin taught us to serve the people, to be devoted to the interests of the people. We are faithful servants of the people. The people want peace and hate war. We hold sacred the people's desire to prevent bloodshed and the deaths of millions, to secure peaceful progress to happiness. Farewell, our teacher and leader, our dear friend, Comrade Stalin! Let's move forward to achieve complete triumph of the cause of Lenin-Stalin! The floor is given to the First Deputy Chairman of Council of Ministers, Comrade Lavrenty Pavlovich Beria. Dear comrades and friends! It's hard to express the feeling of deepest sorrow, which is felt by our Party, by the peoples of our country and by all progressively minded people in the world. Stalin is no more... The great comrade-in-arms and visionary follower of Lenin's cause. The man, nearest and dearest to all the Soviet people, and to millions of workers across the world, has left us. Comrades! Our heartache cannot be relieved, our loss is enormous... But the steel will of the Communist Party won't be broken; its unity won't be shaken, its struggle for Communism will continue! This is why the people of the Soviet Union may fully rely on the Communist Party, its Central Committee and the Soviet government. Enemies of the Soviet state expect that our tragic loss will cause chaos and confusion in our ranks. They are scheming in vain! Bitter disappointment awaits them! Those who have eyes to see, see that in times of hardships our Party is more united than ever, it cannot be broken or shaken. Our great leaders, Lenin and Stalin, taught us to raise the Party's and the people's vigilance and to safeguard the country against the ill-doings of the enemies of the Soviet state. We have to be even more vigilant now! We mustn't let anyone think that the enemies of the Soviet state can catch us unaware. The strength of our state is not only in its victorious, battle-seasoned and heroic army; the might of the Soviet state is in the unity of the Soviet people, in their trust in the Communist Party, the leading force of Soviet society; it's in the people's trust in its Soviet government. The Soviet people have unanimously approved the decree of the Central Committee of our Party, Council of Ministers and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on adopting of a number of important measures aimed at ensuring continuous and efficient governance of our country. One of these important measures was the appointment of Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov, Lenin's gifted disciple and Stalin's comrade-in-arms, to the position of the Chairman of Council of Ministers of the USSR. The nations of our country may rest assured that the Communist Party and the Soviet government will work relentlessly and will dedicated their lives to the cause of maintaining the unity in the Party ranks, to strengthen friendship between nations of the USSR, to increase the power of the Soviet state, to remain true to the ideas of Marxism and Leninism, and, in accordance with the legacy of Lenin and Stalin, to lead the Socialist state to Communism! Glory to our dearly beloved leader and teacher, to the great Stalin! The floor is given to the First Deputy Chairman of Council of Ministers of the USSR, Comrade Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov. Dear comrades and friends! We are all grieving the loss of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin. The departure of the great leader, but also, a close and dear person. As his old and close friends, all of us, millions of Soviet people, workers in all the countries, all over the world we are bidding farewell to Stalin, who we loved so dearly and who will always remain in our hearts. Stalin is the great follower of the great cause of Lenin! Under the leadership of the Communist Party, headed by Comrade Stalin, the Soviet people built Socialism in our country.
