There are swap meets. (laughter) - Swap meets? - Yeah, where do you thinkI got this backgammon board?

You're going back to work. - Oh, no I'm not. - Oh, yes you are. - Oh, no I'm not. - Oh, yes you are. - Oh, you keep out of this. (laughter) I am not going back. I've spent my entire life working, I have earned the right totake life easy for a while. I want to relax and enjoy myself. - Now Lucy, you've just, - You're wasting your time Mickey. You're just wasting your time. I'm not ready to go back to work anymore than Ruta is.

Oh yes he is. Who's calling? The White House? The real White House in Washington DC? You know anybody in the White House? - I hope you don't mind. I left your number with my office. Hello? Yes. It's only the Vice President. (laughter) - Only the Vice President. - Hello Fritz, yes, that's what I told Jody. Look, I'm sorry but Ican't give the Oval Office an hour of primetime. After all, that's only the White House, not the Little House on the Prairie. (laughter) I'm sorry Fritz. Goodbye. It's not an easy job running a network. - Oh you poor boy. And you could be out at Malibu surfing, or you could be in CentralPark roller skating. (laughter) - Ms. Ball, Let me get to the point. NBC needs comedy shows. And there's nobody in theentire spectrum of entertainment who has provided more comedy, to more people for more years than you. - Ugh, look, I've heardthat speech before, and I appreciate it and all. - I'm here to coax you outof your self imposed exile from the public, and help bring a smile to the faces of all of those millions.

Oh, I'm so flattered. - You should be. He's surrounded by clowns in Washington. (laughter) - Mr. Silverman, in spiteof all this flattery, I have to tell you I am notgoing to go back on television. - I don't want you back. - Fine, because there'snothing you can say, there's nothing you can offer me. What? (laughter) - Lucy, all Fred wants is your expertise. He wants you to producea new comedy for NBC. - Me a producer? - Yeah. - Nobody knows more aboutmaking people laugh than you. I want you to put together afirst rate half hour for us. - And you can do it Lucy. - Absolutely. - You really think I can? - I haven't the slightest doubt. Just sign this contract.

(cheers) (laughter) - Johnny Carson. - Oh, Lucy, how are you? - Johnny what a wonderful surprise. - Well you know it's a delightful surprise to see you here at NBC. - I was just going to saythe same thing about you. (laughter) - Lucy I happen to work here. - Oh really? - I got a court order to prove it. (laughter) How did they snag you? Did you loose a pro bowl bet or something? What? - Oh, John, you're so frequently witty. (laughter) No, I just decided to go back to work. - Yeah - Do you know how excitingit is to make a comeback? - I make one every Wednesday night. (laughter) You know Lucy, you're return to Television is the most excitingthing that's happened here in Burbank since theylifted the odd even days on the supermarket prune line. (laughter) - There you go hitting uppoor little Burbank again. - Can I help it ifBurbank's the only place where the Avon lady sell pacemakers. (laughter) I tell you what, enough of liver spots. - Yeah. - I'm really, I'm reallydelighted to see you back on the tube performing again. - Wrong, guest host breath. - What? (laughter) - I am not going to perform. I'm here strictly as a producer. Yeah, it's a dirty rotten thankless job but somebody's got to do it. - Don't tell me you'rethe one that's got to find the new pilot for Don Rickles? (laughter) - No, I'm here to do a comedy show. - Freddy Silverman mustthink a lot of you, this is really some kind of office. - Isn't it. Three color TV sets, wall to wall stereo. (horn) Oh, quite Clyde. - Clyde? - Yeah, Freddy even gave me a live peacock to remind me that I'm now with NBC. (laughter) (applause) - You're very own peacock? - My very own. - Would you save me one of the eggs? (laughter) - Peahens lay eggs, not peacocks. - You don't know the NBC peacock. Many eggs all over yeah. Lucy now that you're a producer, you've very luck I stopped by. Because I happen to havewith me this little pamphlet, that tells you exactlyhow to be a successful television producer. Everything (laughter) you ever wanted to know aboutproducing a television show is right here in these four pages, would you like to hear some of them? - Do I have a choice? - Is Dolly Parton undernourished? (laughter) - Okay, fire away. - First rule is right here. Always hire the rightactor for the right job. For example if you're doing a, oh a show about and Olympic poll vaulter, immediately you do not hire Orson Wells. (laughter) - I'll try to remember that. - Alright, here's another one right here. No star, no star is indispensable. Now even when MiltonBerle was Mr. Television, the network gave him the pink slip. - Yeah, and he's still wearing it. (laughter) - Yeah, but he's cut downon the makeup, you know. Now the most importantthing of all right here, is to stay within your budget. - Oh, you are so right. You know, it's absolutely ridiculous what some of these stars get paid just for showing up. (laughter) Oh, not you Johnny. (applause) No, no you deserve every penny. - Yeah. - You keep more people up at night than Mexican food. (laughter) - You hear that Freddy. I'll be right over, we're going to playtrick or treat tonight. (laughter) Hey Lucy, good talk, so long. - Thank you, thank you. (applause) Wanda? - [Wanda] Yes Ms. Ball? - Who's turn is it now? - [Wanda] It's yours. But there's a Mr. Coleman here to see you. - Coleman? - [Wanda] Yes, he's oneof the Vice President's of the network. - Oh, well, send him in then. - Ms. Ball, Mr. Coleman. (laughter) - Where? - Here my dear. (laughter) - Gary Coleman. - These are for you. Welcome to Burbank. - Oh, thank you, that's so nice of you. And they're lovely. Wanda, give them a drink of water, will you dear? - They're not thirsty, they're hungry. Give them a pizza. (laughter) - Oh Gary, you are so cute. No wonder you're the starof Different Strokes. - That's just part time work. I'm now in charge of allprime time programming. (laughter) - You are putting me on. - Ms. Ball, in my job, Icannot only put you on, I can take you off. (laughter) - Ugh, how long have youbeen a vice president Gary? - Since the last board meeting. Half the board insisted NBC executives should be young peoplewith wild imaginations, and the other half held on for veterans with wisdom and experience. - Well sounds like hiring you and me was Fred's way of placating both sides. - You got it girl. (laughter) Your wild imagination andmy wisdom and experience. (laughter) - You're experience? - Let's face it Lucy, you're brand new here, and I've been with NBCfor two whole years. (laughter) - Two whole years. - It may not sound like much to you, but that's practicallymy whole adult life. (laughter) - Young man, do you have any idea how long I have been in show business? - No. - Gonna be a great pleasureworking with you Gary. (applause) - Good, now, let's sit down and I'll tell you what we're going to do. - Pleasure. (laughter) - Now then, after a lot of study and thought I have come to the conclusion that the thing television does best is take old ideas anddo them as new shows. - Uh huh, you mean update them, and recast them with new faces. - Right, you're mind's not out to lunch. (laughter) - Thank you. - Now then. What I want you to do is take an oldie, then bring in some young artist who can offer the public what I call T and A. (laughter) - T and A? - Talent and Ambition. - Oh. (laughter) By all means, yes. - Country's full ofkids who can bring back the kind of show business we need. Funny kids, who know how to move, and dance. (laughter) (applause) - Oh, Gary you're absolutely wonderful. And I want to thank you forall of your sage advice. - That's why I'm here Lucy, to help you new producers. (laughter) Now excuse me, I've got to run. - Oh, got another meeting? - Yeah, oh, before I leave, you mind if I do something? - No, what? - Well, I've wanted to do thisfrom the minute I saw you. You're so adorable. (laughter) (buzzer) - Yeah Wanda? - [Wanda] Ms. Ball, youhave a very special visitor who just came in. - Who is it? ♫ Oh thanks for the memories (applause) - Bob Hope. (applause) - Hello Lucy. Thank you. - Thank you. ♫ Thanks for the memory ♫ Of all the parts you've played ♫ In pictures we have made ♫ Each rave review I sent to you ♫ Instead of getting paid, ♫ How thrifty you were (laughter) - Me thrifty? - Yes, - How about you, I didn't know Jesse James had a sister. (laughter) - Well now don't stop now. Finish the song, go ahead. - No, not now. We'll finish it on oneof my specials, huh.

(laughter) - Yeah, well I've seen your office Bob. It's not exactly Ms. Piggy's play pen. (laughter) - You mean the Taj Mahal in Toluca Lake? Hey, we both come a long waysince we first met Lucy, huh? - Haven't we. I was a naive young Goldwyn girl sharing a dressing roomwith about 20 others and you, - Yeah, I was an eager young comedian looking for the pot atthe end of the rainbow. - Yeah. And we both made it. I have an office of my own, and you got the pot. (laughter) - Now wait a minute. Don't fondle the flab please. (laughter) When I get home Delorisdusts me for fingerprints. (laughter) - Bob, is Deloris really jealous of, - Jealous of what? - Well that's what I'mtrying to figure out. (laughter) - Oh this is just what we needed, another funny executive at NBC. (laughter) Lucy Silverman, say, (laughter) I can't wait to see your new show, baby, that's all I dropped by. - Oh thank you, Bob. - Bye, bye honey, bye bye. (applause) (cheers) - Ms. Ball, - Yes? - The personnel manager just called to ask if there's anyonespecial you'd like for your production assistant. - Oh, that's a very important job. I want an executive type whoknows how to make decisions. I want to give that some thought. - And, the supervisor called to find out if parkingspace should be painted to read "Lucy" or "Lucille Ball" - Well when I hire my assistant, I'll let him make that decision. (laughter) - Oh, yes, and there'sa Mr. Gordon to see you. - Gordon? Gale? Gale Gordon? (applause) - Oh, Lucy. I am so proud of you. - Thank you. - My little Lucy, now abig television producer. Oh, that's the kind of challenge that makes me envy you. - Envy me? - Yes, going from acting to producing. I think it's wonderful. Tell me, now what kind ofshows are you planning? - Well one of my ideas is toget some exciting newcomers, you know, and surround them with great, experienced performers who, you know, still have somesnap left in their bubblegum. (laughter) - I know what you mean. People who know there craft. - Right. - Not old fogies like me, but who are still able to do things like Yahaa!

At 18 they're still innocent, trusting, open minded, beautiful people. Why turn them intodemocrats and republicans. (laughter) - It's all part of growing up. - Well kids are spoiled enoughwithout letting them vote. - Oh, come off it. How can voting spoil them? - When Scotty was 12,he had his own TV set. When he was 17, he had his own car. Now he's going to have his own President. (laughter) - Look who's talking about spoiling him. You just spent 25 hundreddollars on his birthday present. - Well I just want him to realize when we said he could have a motorcycle, it wasn't the money. Well you didn't want him tohave a motorcycle either. - I know, I know. It's just that, well Idon't want him to think that we're a couple ofold square fuddy daddies. - Well how could he think that? - Well we're not gettingany younger, Wally. - Well, nobody's getting any younger. By the way, how old are you now? (laughter) - 36. - Well you're getting younger. (laughter) - So I lied a little. 38. - Well honey, if you're only38, that makes me only 39. - Be my guest baby face.

Wow. - Well if it's too big, youcan always let your hair grow. (laughter) - And here's somethingto go with it my man. - Oh Ivory, fantastic. Thanks. - If they're too big,let your knuckles grow. (laughter) - Hey out of sight huh dad. - Oh they sure are. Especially for a guy whodoesn't have a motorcycle. - Yet. - And now for our present. We've got something thatwill make this evening and your birthday a milestone that you shall always remember. - Hey anytime you're ready dad, just roll it out. - Look at that face Carol. I've never seen him so surprised. - You can say that again. Dad I got a banjo when I was 10. - This isn't just a banjo. Honey, this one is a collectors item. - Yeah, I paid 25 hundred dollars for it. It was built and designedfor Eddie Peabody himself. - Who's Eddie Peabody? (laughter) - Who's Eddie Peabody? - Who's Eddie Peabody? - Oh he was a banjo player. - A banjo player? Eddie Peabody a banjo player. Was Nijinsky a hoofer? (laughter) Was Rembrandt a cartoonist? Is the Pope Danny Thomas? (laughter) Eddie Peabody was onlythe greatest banjo player that ever lived. And on this very instrument. (laughter) - Gee dad, it was just that I wasexpecting a motorcycle. I mean my old wagon is so shot, I only get 29 miles gallon. - 29 miles a gallon's terrific. - I'm talking about oil. (laughter) I mean if I'm old enough to vote, I'm old enough to ride a motorcycle. - Age has nothing to do with it. We're worried about you getting hurt. - Well after all, it's my body. - It is not. Your mother and I builtit before you moved in. Now listen son, if anything happened to you, after I bought you a motorcycle, I'd feel responsible. - But if I got it on my own, I'd be responsible. - But where would you get money like that? - Scotty listen, I just thought of something. 18's not only the voting age, its also when a person with a job can apply for credit. - You're right. She's right. I can get those wheels on credit. - Now according to this young man, you are applying for creditto finance a new motorcycle? - Yes sir, that model. That's the one I want. - And excellent choice Mr. Coogan. It says here you work for your father but you don't state any salary. I assume you receive one. - Well not exactly. - Not exactly? (laughter) - Dad gives me an allowance every week. $35. - That much. (laughter) Well I trust dear old dad will guarantee this $2,000 loan. - Oh no sir. - No, no? (laughter) - He said I have to get it on my own. - Oh, clever man. (laughter) Well, do you have any collateralto guarantee the loan? - Collateral? - Something of value, real estate, stocks, bonds, meat. - Oh I know. I have something of value you can keep til the bike's paid off. - For example? - A musical instrument. - Oh, a musical, worth $2,000. - It's no ordinary instrument. It's a collectors item. It once belonged to thelate, great Eddie Peabody. - Eddie Peabody. Wasn't he a banjo player? - A banjo player? You call Eddie Peabodyjust a banjo player? Was Nijinsky a bush pilot? (laughter) Was Limburg a dancer? Is the Pope Danny Thomas? (laughter) I can prove that banjo's worthat least 25 hundred dollars. - How? - I'll bring in the sales receipt. And my dad's cancelled check. Please. - You don't have to kiss my ring. (laughter) Sit down. Well, with that kind of verification, and leaving the banjo here as collateral, I think, - Oh thank you Mr. Tetley. You're one credit managerwho's a credit to credit. - Thank you very much. I was until you made apawn broker out of me. (laughter) well. (applause) - [Announcer] Stay tuned for Lucy when Sister Hitchcock returnsfor the surprise ending. - At last they take a C, an F,and the bass take an A, okay. Carol, Carol, I've got a problemabout what to wear tonight. - We're all wearing tuxedos. - I'm talking about my hair. (laughter) I don't know which one fits the occasion. - Gee, I've never seen this one before. - That's brand new. That's my Robert Redford, huh. (laughter) - You look more like Barbara Streisand. (laughter) - Come on. - Well, it's you. - Okay, thanks a lot. - You're welcome. - Honey, can I cut yournumber down to one chorus? - What? - Well this year, I'mcutting everybody down to make room for anextra added attraction. - And what is that? - Well Al wrote an arrangement for Scotty to do a solo on his Eddie Peabody banjo. - Oh, oh, won't he be so surprised. - Yeah, and honey, I got another idea. Listen, one, two, three, four. (laughter) (applause) - Well you said if I got it on my own. And the payments are only 90 a month. - Well how'd you get financing? - There was some red tape. But I guess the credit manager figured I've got an honest face. Aren't you proud of me? - Proud of what? That our bundle from Heavenis now a Hell's Angel? (laughter) - Dad, I came in herehoping you'd be surprised. - Oh we are. - Oh, and we have awonderful surprise for you, your dad and I, you're going to be in our show tonight. - With my group? - Oh, are you kidding? You're doing a solo onyour Eddie Peabody banjo. - Isn't that exciting? - Yeah. Real heavy. (laughter) Gee, I don't think I ought to. - Well why not? - Well, it's just becauseit's kind of a big night for you guys. And well dad, it's nothing personal, I'm just trying to protect my image. - Protect your what? - My image. With the group that plays today's music. - Now listen Scotty. I've heard what you play, and stop calling it music. What these guys play, now that's music. And when they play, theelectricity is in the artist, not in their instruments. (laughter) And when they book a date, they don't have to find out first if the building is AC or DC. (laughter) - Dad, you guys are great. But I want a chance tobe great with my guys. Not playing a banjo at a gig, where the groupies areplugged into hearing aids. (laughter) - Hearing aids? If we're so over the hill, how come this is the third straight year that they booked us? - I don't know, ask mom, she's head of the entertainment committee. (laughter) - That had nothing to do with it. - You don't owe him any explanation. - Dad I didn't mean that mom, - And you don't owe me any one either, now, you just take, youjust take a 3000 bar rest. (laughter) And now you take it on the A D A. - Right okay. - I'd better split til he simmers down. See you later mom. - Ah, don't spoil your image by kissing and old broken down groupie. You might pop my hearing aid. (laughter) - A little rough on him weren't you? - Not any rougher than he was on you. - Well he was just backed intoa corner looking for an out. - What do you mean. - Well nobody extendscredit on an honest face. This kid's either sold his banjo, or he's hocked it. - Okay, let's take it from the top Wally. - One, two, three, four. I always brag about how honest my son was. How loyal my son was. - I know dear. - And now to see that kid of yours pull a trick like this, I'll kill him. - My kid? Why will you please listen to me. Scotty is at an age now where he needs, he needs your help and gentility, not for you to yell at him. - Well, alright. I'll tell you what. When I get home tonight after the show, I'll have a heart to heart talk with him. - Awe, that's good. - And then I'll kill him. (laughter) One, two, three, four. (band music) - Carol honey, hurry it's your big finale. - Oh I hope I get through this. I'm just frantic about Scotty. We haven't seen himsince 11:00 this morning. - Oh, he's 18 now dear. - But he's got a motorcycle.
