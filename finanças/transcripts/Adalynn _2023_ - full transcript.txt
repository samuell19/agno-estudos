To keep them safe from the dangers of the world, she'll stay with them, in the den, until they can survive on their own. It's a sacrifice she makes. Because if something were to happen to her, then her cubs would surely die. But if something were to happen to her cubs, what would become of the mother? Could she live with it? Ah! I can't!

I'm gonna be the kind of mother for you that I never had. You're going to have a great childhood. You have two parents who love you very much. When I met your father, it was love at first sight.

From what I hear, we won't get another one until our kid grows up and moves out. [water running] I haven't taken my medicine for a year, so now I can get a little obsessive about things. I mean, who doesn't, right? Who doesn't? Sometimes it's the little things. You gotta be shitting me. [thermostat beeps] I check the locks. Sometimes a lot. And I'm sure to close every single door in the house. Setting the TV volume to an even number, or rearranging ornaments and place settings. God, don't get me started on making sure all the photos in the house are level. But sometimes it's a little more than that. Sometimes I get this irrational fear that someone is watching me. Or stalking me. I know it's an irrational fear, but... doesn't stop me from checking everything. I don't know what an extreme case would look like for me, but God, I hope I never find out. I haven't taken my medicine. [quiet, unsettling music] It's only when I know that everything's perfect that I can finally be calm. But when is anything ever perfect? Doesn't stop me from trying, though. Everyone told me that having a child would change my life forever. I guess I didn't realize how much Elizabeth would change mine.

I didn't feel connected to her at all. But I can't think about that now. Back to real life. My cub needs her mother. What? Nothing. It's just, we did it. We have a baby. [Bill] So, uh, did you get some sleep last night? [yawning] I slept like a baby. As in up every two hours, crabby, kinda wanting my mommy. I feel like I just woke up after a college bender. Mm... So, uh, start your meds yet? Uh, not yet. I just, um-- I'm not sure, after last time. Well, the new pills should be okay, it's the, uh, blue ones. They're in my purse. I keep forgetting I have 'em. Those ones are a little different. They should kick in-- in about ten to 15 minutes. You know, I, uh-- I can withdraw from this conference. Bill, no. This conference is too important. If I need anything, I'll call Cici. Okay? We're good here. So you are going. You sure? Yeah. It's only a week. We won't even... notice you're gone. Plus I, um... I was thinking about doing some painting this weekend. Yeah? Hmm. You inspired? -I have some ideas. -Hmm. You, uh, been checking the locks again. Sometimes. Heard you counting, too, Adalynn.

I'm sorry. [Adalynn breathing shakily] Babe, I'm sorry about earlier with the crib and you going into labor, it's... Just-- just slipped my mind, like an idiot. It's fine. You just caused a little freak-out. But I got through it. Do you want to talk about it? -Adalynn? Adalynn? -Huh? Oh, um... I'm okay. Spent a little quality time with the stress ball earlier, so I'm okay. Really. Do you wanna talk about it? [phone vibrates] That's my ride. Okay. -Love you. -Love you. Bill. Don't you wanna give your newborn daughter -a kiss goodbye? -[Bill] Of course. Bye. Hey. What's wrong? I don't wanna leave you alone. I know. But Elizabeth and I will be okay.

You know, my hormones were really outta control, remember? And I could not have gotten through that without you. And I'm here for you, too. -Thank you. -Okay. Well, sweetie, what are you doing today? I was thinking that we could get takeout from Croso's and catch up. I'm dying to meet the baby. Oh, um, we're not really up for visitors just yet. [Cici sighs] -You sure you're okay? -Yeah. I'm fine. Uh, everything's perfect. Well, i-- if you're not, there's no shame in it. I mean, nobody's really perfect, you know? We'll be fine.

Right, but are you sure, though? About the choking? Oh, yes. It's very common. Um, infants are born with a hyper gag reflex. Um, when it happens, just let it pass. Um, adjust the baby's position, maybe your own, and resume feeding. Yeah, I-- I knew that, I just, um... I just forgot. Uh... It just-- it all happened so fast, you know, like, in that instant, it all-- it all could've just-- I'm sorry, you probably think I'm crazy. I could tell you stories about what lengths I've seen mothers go to to protect their young. It happens in nature, you know. Um, polar bears, for example.

I-- I haven't taken any. Um, I don-- I don't want to. You know, a-- after last time. Adalynn, that was a completely different situation. Yeah. Because I aborted him. It wasn't your fault. The-- the-- the-- the fetus-- It's Miles. His name was Miles. Miles had severe cardiac abnormalities. It was no longer a viable pregnancy. You know, we-- we took the best option. It wasn't your fault. I know. I know. I'm sorry, I just... I think about it... a lot. Everything was so perfect. I don't understand. Why him? Was it the meds? Was it me? Was it something that I did? There wasn't anything that anyone could have done. He, uh... he would've been due six years ago last week. He would've been six. [chuckles] I sometimes wonder wha-- what my life would've been like if he would've lived. I think about it every day. You shouldn't do that to yourself. Besides, if he'd lived, who knows how it would've affected your life? You could have missed out on this beautiful bundle of joy right here. Sure, but... it's not all I think about. I also wonder what my life would've been like... without either of them. And then I get to thinking, "Did I will that to happen?" No. Ab-- absolutely not. What if I did? Stop! You loved your baby. Miles. You love both your children. Uh, you're just having an episode. It is just so much harder without the pills. You know, I-- I wish I could just take one. At least just one, Doctor. That-- that's not in your best interest right now. All right? I know it's hard, but this will pass. I'm just so afraid that something might happen. -Like what? -[Adalynn] I don't know. Sometimes things just happen, you know? Or-- or what if I do something? Are you afraid you may harm yourself or your baby? No. No, no. [Dr. Van Doren] Have you been seeing things? You would tell me, right? Yes, yeah. Yes, of course, Doctor. I just wondered, is all. [Dr. Van Doren] Okay. Well, remember that there's a after-hours number you can call, uh, if you need to. And in the meantime, I can assure you that your baby is in perfect health. And you have nothing to fear but fear itself.

But if I can just make it a few more days, Bill will be home and we can deal with this together. Just hold on, Adalynn. We can get through this. Just a little bit longer.

Hold on a second. Let's just take a minute, all right? Let's think about this. There has to be-- has to be a logical explanation, right? You said the doors were unlocked. Yes. And it was opened. And no one entered the house, right? No. I mean, I don't think so. But I heard-- I-- I thought I heard-- [Adalynn panting] Adalynn? I didn't see anyo-- anybody come in, but-- -they could have. -How? [Adalynn] What? What difference does that make? You're checking locks again. When was the last time you checked before that? I don't know. 1:00, 1:30, why? And were they locked? -And they were locked? -Yes. Exactly. [Adalynn sighs] You're saying they were locked. How could they be unlocked? [Bill] They couldn't be, right? Adalynn? Maybe they picked the locks or something. I don't know. And what about the animals downstairs? What animals, Adalynn? The-- the-- the ceramic animals, Bill. The-- the-- the penguins, the polar bears. They were all mixed up and facing different ways. And I thought maybe I imagined it, but-- -[sighs] -Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. Hold on. You imagined it? [Adalynn] After tonight-- Somebody has been in our house, Bill. Look, I saw what I saw. Okay? Why don't you believe me? Listen, I do believe you. I believe you heard something, but I don't believe-- [Adalynn] That is not what I meant. [Bill] Listen, I'm coming home. All right? I'll come home. -I'll catch the next flight out. -Bill. [sighs] No. [chuckles] Well, then tell me, what the fuck am I supposed to do, Adalynn? Please, please. I'm out-- I'm outta answers. You have to finish. I'm sorry.

I see now how unsustainable perfection is. I was never perfect. There's no such thing. There's just life. And when living it, shit happens sometimes. Whether pointless and mundane, or in a way that's cruel and earth-shattering. And when you're dealt a hand like that, I think you're left with a choice. You can find a way to live with it, or you can let it destroy you. Rather, you can destroy yourself and everything about you. Everything in your life. It sounds like an easy choice, but sometimes it's not. I, like many others, couldn't trust my brain to tell me the truth. And what's worse... I couldn't tell anyone what I was going through. What would people say, if I told them what I saw and felt? -They'd say I was crazy. -[shutter clicks] -They'd call me a monster. -[shutter clicks] Maybe they'd even try and take Elizabeth. But I'm not a monster. I'm a mother, like so many others, who went through some serious postpartum shit and can't even talk about it. We keep our mouths shut to avoid judgment. So we won't be labeled unfit. We ignore our own health to keep this deadly secret. But sometimes people need help, too. -[phone vibrating] -And, God, do I wish it was easier to ask for. Talk about a perfect world. Hey, girl. But we have to try. We have to open up to the people who care about us. And try and make the best of the world that we live in. We find ways to cope. We take it day by day. And in time, we improve. We heal, and we live on to fight another day. We do it for our cubs, like the great mother polar bear. So, I'll paint. I'll leave all my pain and my anger and my broken heart on the canvas. And with that, with every cathartic stroke and every drop of pigment squeezed out of my very soul, I'm set free. Does that mean I'm cured? [chuckles] No. I'm just... managing. I'm getting by, maybe even improving a little. I mean, Bill's prescriptions help, too, obviously. I read that they don't work for everyone. But Bill was right. After 15 minutes, these little blue pills gave me something I haven't had for weeks. Maybe not since we lost Miles. They gave me hope. And hope is just what I needed to save my family... and save my life. [lock clicking] Adalynn, I'm home. Found this on the porch. I just ordered this. [Adalynn] Oh. Hi. -[Bill sighs] Adalynn. -[Adalynn chuckles] [Adalynn] And Elizabeth. -I was so worried, so worried. -[Adalynn chuckles] I'm so sorry. -It's okay. -You okay? I'm per-- I'm good. [whispering] Hi. -[Adalynn chuckles] -[Miles] Daddy! [eerie music] -This isn't right. -[Miles] Daddy! No! This isn't right. [breathing heavily] This isn't right. This isn't right. [eerie creaking] [Miles] Mommy! This isn't right. This isn't right. [demonic voice] What's the matter, Mommy? [snickering] [Dr. Van Doren] Adalynn. Adalynn. [gasping] You're okay. You're having another episode. Focus on my voice and do your counting. No, this isn't right. -[Dr. Van Doren] Adalynn. -You're not real. None of this is real. Leave us alone. I'm afraid this is worse than I thought. Remember, Adalynn. Remember how you got here. No. No, this isn't real. This isn't real. You've had some trouble discerning what's real from what's imaginary for a while now. No, no. You created an elaborate fantasy for yourself to escape the fact that you-- It wasn't your fault, Adalynn. Now, please... give it here. No. No, she's my baby. Go on. Look for yourself. [sobs] No. [whimpering in horror] [sniffles] Where is she? Where's Elizabeth? Where's Elizabeth? Please tell me. [sniffles] Maybe you should have a seat. No, doctor, please tell me. [machine beeping rhythmically] I'm sorry. Your baby died, Adalynn. [machine beeping continuously] -No. No, no, no, no, no! -[sobbing] No, no! -[Miles] Daddy! -[Bill speaking inaudibly] -No, God, no! Oh, no, no, no, no. [tape rewinding] [breathing heavily] -[evil laughter] -[eerie music booms] [Adalynn sobbing] ♪ ♪ -[Siri] Cici. -[phone ringing] [ringing continues] Adalynn, I'm so glad that you picked up your phone. I have been trying to get in touch with you for a few days. There was a nursery incident, I was gonna stop by. It was a whole thing. Addy? Cici? You okay? [Adalynn sobbing on phone] It won't stop. What won't stop? It won't stop until I do it. [Cici] Do what? [sighs] Adalynn? Hey, I can't help you unless you tell me what's wrong. Okay? Hey, talk to me. [Adalynn] I lost them both. I can't live with that. [Cici] Adalynn, I want you to remember your breathing, okay? Okay, deep breaths. Can you put the baby somewhere safe? [nurse] I gave her two milligrams of Lorazepam. It's best to just let her rest. I have to say goodbye. [Cici] Adalynn! Adalynn, I want you to stay on the phone with me. Okay? Adalynn? Adalynn, I'm coming for you, okay? [clock ticking] Hi, um, Dr. Bolland. [ticking continues] [Cici] Addy! Addy, stop it! Whatever you're doing, I want you to sit down. Addy, can you hear me? Sweetheart, I'm coming to get you. Okay? I'm gonna come. I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get the baby. Addy! Addy! I'm Mary Stewart, the grief counselor here at St. Patrick's. How is Adalynn? She's devastated. She keeps asking to see the baby. [Cici] Pick the phone up. Can you say something for me? Addy, please! I need to be with her right now. Okay, Bill, Bill-- -[breathing heavily] -[Cici] [indistinct] here. -I'm almost here, okay? -[tires screeching] [Mary] Let's have a seat, please. [ticking continues] [Cici] Addy, pick up your phone! This wasn't supposed to happen, you know? [voice cracking] We did everything right this time, everything. Well, for starters, she's gonna need comprehensive therapy. -[keys jingling] -[Cici breathing heavily] [shower running] That's gonna fucking break her. Adalynn! [ticking continues] -[breathing heavily] -[music intensifies] [Elizabeth crying] [Bill] She insists Elizabeth's still alive. I know what you're gonna say, but I think Adalynn could really benefit from a reborn doll. What the fuck? I'm dying to meet the baby. Oh, um... we're not really up for visitors just yet. [doll coughing] [breathing heavily] It wasn't your fault. [both] As far as I'm concerned... It wasn't anybody's fault. [Adalynn] If something were to happen to mama bear, then her cubs would surely die. But if something were to happen to her cubs... what would become of the mother? Would she have the strength to survive? [Cici] Adalynn! Adalynn! [Bill] Absolutely certain you wanna do this? [sobbing] Yeah. -[suspenseful music] -[doll crying] [ticking stops] -[Adalynn sobs] -[crying continues] -[crying fades] -[ticking resumes] [Adalynn] And in time, we heal. And we live on to fight our battles again another day. Unfortunately, I don't think we'll ever win the war. But we can still fight. Protect our families. Even at great sacrifice to ourselves, we fight. We fight to the bitter end.
