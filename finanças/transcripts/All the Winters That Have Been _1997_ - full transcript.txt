(somber music) (airplane humming) (somber music) (airplane humming) (somber music) (seagulls squawking) (door bangs) Thanks, Pete. Okay. (somber music) Wow. (branch rattles) (hand knocks) Ren? (door creaks) Uncle Ren? (dial tone beeps) (Dane sighs) (phone receiver clatters) (door creaks) What's a guy have to do to get a cup of coffee around here? (logs rattle) You were supposed to be here two hours ago. Plane was late and your phone was busy. Oh, the damn phone. The ringing drives me nuts. I got it. So you just left it off the hook, huh? I was trying to read. You still take your coffee black? Same as you. How's the old place look to you? Well, it needs a little work. Otherwise, it's just as I remembered. Well, 20 years is a long time. Some things you don't forget. Have you eaten? No, I was waiting for you. I remember where the kitchen is. Oh my God. House special. Well, we're just gonna have to wash 'em again. So I'll wash 'em. Didn't you see that stack of paper plates out there? I want to talk to your doctor. I told you, there's nothing they can do. End of subject. What kind of cancer is it? I'm leaving you the house. You helped build it, it's got you in it. But Ren, I love this house, you know that. And I'm grateful, but I'm away on assignment all the time, and it'd just be wasted on me. Well, what, what kind of a life is working all the time? No roots. My life suits me fine. I didn't come here to talk about me. I came to help shape up the place and visit with my favorite uncle. Your only uncle. You gonna see Hannah? No. (saw cutting) (somber music) (seagulls cawing) (Dane sighs) (somber music) (boat motor hums) (somber music) (soft country music) Beer, please. (hand thumps) (beer can thumps) I'm looking for somebody named Waldo. Never heard of him. It's a small island, I find that hard to believe. Why don't you go back to the mainland where you belong? (tray rattles) (boot heels clack) What do you want with Waldo? Friend told me to look him up. Who? Frank Raymond. You're a businessman? I don't see how that concerns you. You want to talk to Waldo, you'll answer the question. I own a couple of restaurants. I'm looking for a new supplier, and I'm told Waldo might have a connection. You got a card? Yup. Seattle. Be at the cove at nine. What cove, where? Don't be late. He won't be there. (owl hoots) (crickets chirp) You said Waldo was gonna be here. You're looking at him. Why didn't you tell me this afternoon? I had to check you out. Raymond said he thought you were okay, but he couldn't swear to it. Well, know that our credentials are on the table, do we do business or not? It's up to her. What do you think? (solemn music) He's a liar. Of course I'm a liar, so are you. We're dealing in the black market. (solemn music) Look, if you're girlfriend's gonna decide whether we make a deal or not, I'm outta here. She's my sister, and I make my own decisions. So, what's your decision? I don't know yet. (solemn music) It's a bit like old times having you back here again. We built a hell of a house. Eh, you turned out to be one hell of a carpenter. Your dad would be proud of ya. I know I used to watch him work, but it was so long ago I hardly remember him. Ah, the best woodworker I ever saw. Set it down here for a minute, will ya? Yeah. Yeah. Why don't you quit that job of yours and move back up here? I know you could get work. I'm good enough to help out, that's about it. Besides, I like my work. How soon do you have to leave? Not for a couple of weeks. I'm checking out something up here. Which reminds me. Mind if I leave early today? No, you going somewhere? Yeah, Raven Island. Can I take the boat? Why, you don't wanna swim? (chuckles) Something's got your interest over there. Hang onto this for me. And don't wait up. No, I wasn't planning on it. (cue balls striking) (soft country music) ♪ 'Cause when she called me up ♪ ♪ She never found me in ♪ (men laugh) This game open? You feeling lucky? Matter of fact, I am. I like to play a man who feels lucky. He makes mistakes. Why does a white man come all the way here to play cards with a red man? White, red or black, I play with whoever I want. (man hoots playfully) (men laugh) Relax, Irene. He's a businessman. We might be making a deal. I call. (cards slap) Not bad. However. (hand thuds) I thought you were bluffing. I don't bluff. I have to keep my eye on you. (heels clacking) Hey. It's good when a man knows his luck. My brother is not always so aware. Would you like to take a walk? Sure. You don't look like you're brother. Yes, well, we had different parents. My mother was Winnemish, the daughter of a healer, a shaman. She fell in love with an Irishman, my father, and left the island. Six years later she came back a widow. Married a Winnemish man with a son. Waldo. Was it difficult coming here from a mixed background? You mean a half-breed? Metis. Ah, metis. Yes, but I resemble my father. If it hadn't been for Waldo, I don't know how I would have survived. Hmm. He protected me and he raised me. I owe him everything. And now I protect him. From what? Mostly from himself. He doesn't always make the best choices. This is my secret place. (gentle music) Beautiful. I've never brought anybody here before. What's this? It's the raven. The raven sees everything, knows everything. Sometimes they say the raven is like the trickster. It leads us to our most difficult lessons in life. It's my symbol, it was passed to me by my grandmother. What's your symbol? I don't know, what do you think? I knew the moment I saw you. What? I'll tell you tomorrow night when I see you, if you like. The saltwater tribes did not hunt. They acquired game through trading. I'm gonna have to flunk this kid. I'm not used to you being so quiet! Something bothering you? It's this case I'm on. It's getting a little complicated. How so? Well, it's pretty involved. I'll handle it. Sure you will. (men shouting) (man grunts) (man groans) (men cheering) Hey, I was wondering if you were gonna show up. Waldo, Irene. Are we gonna do business or not? Can you throw an ax? I didn't come here to play games, Waldo. (dog barks) (men chattering) Maybe you'll like the stakes. You beat me, we deal. Are you a man of your word or not? Okay. (Waldo laughs) All right, Waldo. (men chattering) (ax whooshes) (ax thuds) (men cheer) (lips smacking) Looks like your luck just turned. (ax whooshes) (ax thuds) No, thanks. I don't trust a man who won't drink with me. I'm through playing games, Waldo. Now, if you wanna make a deal, that's fine. If you don't, that's fine too. (men chattering) You must not care about your business deal. It's up to Waldo now. I don't stand on my head for anybody. That's because you're a wolf. That's your symbol, and a lone wolf at that. I'll wait for you tomorrow night in my secret place. Maybe if the wolf is not such a loner, he'll show up. (hammer bangs) Ah, damn. What happened, huh? Pay attention. Yeah, I'm sorry. Well, I don't wanna hear I'm sorry. You gotta keep your mind on what you're doing. I'm not sure I like what I'm doing. Well, I hope you're not talking about the door. I wish I was. Yeah. You gotta live with yourself, you know. Yeah. No, this will be all right. A little varnish and a little filler. So the wolf is not such a loner after all. (gentle music) Hi. Hi. I made this for you. Wow. For protection. It's a raven. Thank you. Hannah. I've gotta tell you who I am. No, I know who you are. You don't know, there's something... I dreamt of you four winters ago. You came here and we made love. We belong together, wolf and raven. I've been waiting. (gentle music) (birds chirp) (lips smacking) Come. And you're here on business? Well, partly. My uncle lives here on the big island. And your parents? Oh, he's pretty much it. I lost my father when I was five. And my mother sent me to live with Ren every summer. She felt I needed a strong hand. A wise woman. I still try to make it up here every year. We're trying to finish building a house that we've been working on for, ooh, ever since I can remember. What's the wood for? Oh, to carve. This is where I live. (lips smacking) I'll see you tomorrow. That's the path to town. Bye. (lips smacking) (footsteps thudding) What's all this? Huh, oh. Ah, some stuff I found in the shed. This is yours. Mine? Yup. That's some stuff of your mother's. Really? Yeah, a lot of stuff out there. Must have got mixed up in the shuffle over the years. Hey. What's her name? Hannah. (men chattering) Tim, a couple of cold ones for me and my friend. I'm not staying, Waldo. That's what I always say, but it usually doesn't end up that way. So, uh. How much are you looking to buy? I need about 200 pounds a week. Shouldn't be a problem. Cash on delivery, a buck a pound. (thunder cracking) (hand knocking) (shoes thudding) Wow. (lips smacking) Hi. Hi. Well, that's incredible. I didn't know you were an artist. Well, unfortunately, no one else does either. That's the problem. It's my passion, but it doesn't pay the rent. It will, that's great. (lips smacking) Are you hungry? Yeah. (shoes thudding) Thanks. (apple crunches) I got something for ya. Ooh. It's beautiful. (gentle music) It was my mother's. Thank you. (thunder cracking) (lips smacking) You walked all the way here in the rain? Sure did, yeah. I love to walk in the rain. Oh, listen. Come on. (Hannah laughs) Come on, come back here. Come on inside. (laughs) (door bangs) (lips smacking) I love you. There's something I've gotta tell you. (door bangs) (door slams) (latch clicks) (gentle music) (thunder cracking) (lips smacking) You are incredibly beautiful. (lips smacking) (thunder cracking) (engaging music) (footsteps thudding) Son of a bitch. Yeah. (chuckles) Tides blow out here. (men laugh) You got some time. Yeah, it looks like it. Wanna show you something. (boots thud) Mike, you take the wheel. Let's show him how this community really works. (motor hums) Let's go! (motor hums) Ahoy, maties! Leave some fish for me! Hey, Waldo! (Waldo laughs) (men chattering) The Winnemish have fished these waters for hundreds of years. Long before civilization. We can't make a living from it anymore. Man can't make due working just six months a year. And that's the law. No commercial fishing out of season. We can fish, but only for what our families can use. You don't wanna overfish. These are Winnemish waters. The laws should not include us. Sounds to me like they're there for your protection. If you agree with the law, then why are you breaking it? I don't always do what I think is right. Then we understand each other. My sister's not like anyone else. She sees things others don't see. She believes in destiny. And she thinks you're hers. Are you? I don't know about my destiny or anybody else's, but my feelings for Hannah are the real thing. Little bit more! They're catching the fish you'll buy tonight. Yeah. Hey, I talked to Fred. He wants $12 a plank. Gee. I told him for that kind of money, I'd cut my own damn wood. (hammer banging) Hey. Something's been eating on you for a week, and I wanna know what. I'm tired of one-sided conversations. Have enough of them when you're not here. I've been investigating poachers on Raven Island. Is this Hannah involved? No, but her brother is, and that's the problem. I've been posing as a buyer. You haven't told her the truth? No, it wasn't a problem at first. She was just his sister. Oh, now you have feelings for the girl. Yeah. And I don't know what to do. Well, you got a job to do. (hammer bangs) Tell her the truth. Let the chips fall where they may. (tires rumbling) You better have a good reason for getting me all the way out here. Quentin, I want off this case. It's too late for that. I have a serious conflict of interest here, and the way we've been investigating it is wrong. That's not for you to decide. Poaching is against the law. It's not that cut and dried. They feel they have a tribal right to fish these waters. They're breaking the law, but they see our law as breaking theirs. I don't care who was here first. The laws in this country apply to everyone. Well, can't we at least give 'em a chance? Serve a cease and decease first. If they ignore it, I'll make the arrest. You're gonna make it regardless. And you're gonna do it tonight. I can't. Fine, I'll send Max. Do that and someone will end up dead. (car door bangs) The arrest is gonna be made. How it's made is up to you. Peaceful or violent, it's your choice. (engine revs) Hannah? (hand knocks) Hannah? (suspenseful music) Oh, Tim, if you see Hannah, tell her Dane has to talk to her, please. It's very, very important. I couldn't find her, anywhere. Maybe you should postpone this thing till you do. I tried, but I can't. I'll need my badge. (zipper clatters) Anything I can do to help? I wish there was. (suspenseful music) (boat motor hums) Okay. You're gonna haul it in that thing? Is that a problem? Come and see for yourself. It's packed in ice, but that won't last for tonight. Let me worry about that. Suit for yourself. It's good fish and you know it's fresh. Looks okay. (Waldo laughs) Aren't you gonna count it? I trust him. (laughs) (lips smacking) I'm sorry, Waldo, there was no other way. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. (siren wailing) You have the right to an attorney. If you can't afford one, one will be supplied to you. Waldo, the police! These waters belong to my people. They belong to everyone, Waldo. (fist smashes) (Dane groans) Waldo, go, now! Stop! Police, stop right there! (siren wailing) Wait! (siren wailing) Take it easy. Hey, leave him alone. Leave him alone, leave him alone! Careful, don't hurt him! You go to hell! (people shouting) Get your hands off her! Waldo. Irene. Take it easy! Calm down. Calm down. Let go of me! Get away from him. He's a traitor! (Waldo screams) Damn, I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Shut up, buddy. He's a traitor! Get away! I'm sorry. Put your head down. Leave. Leave! And never come back. (siren wailing) (somber music) (door slams) Hot tea coming up! They didn't have rye, so I got whole wheat. Ren? My pills. Where are they? In the kitchen, by the window. Here you go. Should I call a doctor? No. Just leave me be. Thank you for seeing me. Well, I was gonna give you a call anyway. Your uncle told me that you were gonna be coming out here to spend some time with him. He won't talk about his illness, except that it's cancer. He has cancer of the stomach. He needs to start chemotherapy immediately. Then he has a chance. No. But it'll probably buy him more time. How much more? Well, I can't be certain, but my guess would be about a year. What if he refuses treatment? Then he'll be gone in a month, if that. (footsteps thudding) (somber music) (pedestrians chattering) (doorbell chiming) I'll have one of those and tea as well. Hey, how ya doin'? Hey. (gentle music) See you later. Bye, Emily. Bye. I would have done that. You weren't here. I talked to Dr. Williamson. Who the hell told you to do that? What's going on, Ren? Why won't you start chemotherapy? Because I'm a goner! Nothing's gonna change that. It could give you time. You've gotta fight! What the hell for? There's nothing I want anymore. There's something I want, time with you. I'm tired, Dane! I, it's time to tie up loose ends. That's why I asked you to come back here. I want you to be happy. Go and see her. This isn't about me, it's about you. Look, I'm sorry I didn't come back and see you all those years. It was just too painful to be here. And we can't get those years back, but we've still got the time ahead of us. And if there's a treatment that can make you feel better and maybe live longer, we can make some of that up. Ren, please, go see the doctor. (somber music) Okay. (door creaks) (announcer chattering) Raven Island, ancient home of the Winnemish. Okay if I tie up here? No problem! (announcer chattering) Thanks a lot. What happened to the Thunderbird Tavern? Ah, they turned that into the Raven Art Gallery. (somber music) Hey, wait up! (people chattering) (birds warble) (door handle rattles) (somber music) (door bangs) (somber music) It's called the Raven and the Wolf. It's beautiful. Do you know anything about the artist? Hannah Raven? She's one of the best carvers working today. An important artist. You're not welcome here. Irene, I want to see Hannah. Where is she? She'll never see you. Well, maybe not, but I'm sure gonna try. It won't do you any good. As far as she's concerned, you're dead. Now get out. (patrons chattering) (door creaks) (door bangs) Oh, sorry. Hannah? (door bangs) (shoes clacking) You saw him. A few minutes ago. You didn't talk to him. No. Good. Then he came all this way for nothing. And that's the way he'll leave, with nothing. He didn't come to see me. His uncle lives here. He wants to see you. I have no interest in talking to him. He'll come looking for you. With excuses and promises. He can go back to wherever he came from. I want nothing to do with him. Oh, I'll start chemo as soon as I get my blood work back. Should be the day after tomorrow. That's great. (car door bangs) That's great news. Yeah. Listen, I ran into Hannah on a street corner. Surprised the hell outta both of us. What, did you talk to her? No, she just turned around and walked away. Just walked away. Hey, you gotta go and set things straight. How, she won't talk to me? That's the end of it. You sure give up easy. You haven't been the same since that night. You gotta talk to her, try to work it out. No, do it, before it's too late. (somber music) (Hannah groans) (footsteps thudding) You should start laying in your wood supply. Winter's coming. I've gotten through many winters without your advice. How did you find me? I asked in the village. People here are too trusting. I remember when I used to be. How's Waldo? What do you care? I don't expect you to understand this, but I care very much. I did then and I do now. Oh, well then that makes everything fine. Hannah? Hannah, I want to talk. Talk all you want, but not to me. (door bangs) (somber music) (footsteps pattering) Okay, chow time. Chow time. What time is it? Almost seven. Come on. I'm not hungry. Come on, come on, have something to eat. God, you sure can be pigheaded when the mood strikes you. What'd you do all day besides slaving over a hot stove? I took your advice. I went to Raven Island. Could have saved myself the trouble. Did you at least talk with her? Oh yeah. Yeah, enough to know she never wants to see me again. And you accept that? What right do I have? Oh my God. She's made her own life there. I'd just be ripping open old wounds. Damn it to hell, use your head, Dane. She's angry at you. She wouldn't be human if she wasn't. Even Margaret used to freeze me out sometimes, but she'd always thaw. Hannah's not Margaret, and I'm not you. No, you're not dying. The way you're acting, you might as well be. You think I want to cash in my chips? You don't know me. There's thing I wanna do and see. Time! Now I'd give anything for more time. And here you are, throwing it away. I'm tired, leave me alone. (solemn music) (ax thuds) (ax thuds) What do you think you're doing? I'm chopping wood. What you've got here won't last a week. (ax thuds) It'll take a couple of days to finish chopping all this. I want you to leave! I will, I will, soon as I'm finished. (ax thuds) (boat horn honks) Hey, sis. Hey, Waldo. Did you get that inventory done? I'll get to it. (sighs) I need the figures for the accountant! You promised you'd have it. Sorry. I didn't mean to snap. It's not you. He has nerve coming back here. Probably thinks everything's even, by getting me outta jail. It didn't even begin to cover what he did. What? What did you say? Dane got you into that rehab program? Yeah. Why didn't you tell me? What did it matter to you? He was out of your life. That wasn't your decision to make. All these years, I thought he just walked away. He did walk away! And not just from you. I spent five years in a cell because of him. And I came out a hell of a lot worse than I went in. Dane didn't stick that needle in your arm, you did. I never would have started if I hadn't been in jail. Oh, you were headed that way anyway, with him or without him. I'm sick of your self-pity. The world doesn't revolve around you. You're not the only one who lost something that day! Do you ever think of that? (ax thudding) (footsteps thudding) (water splashing) (door creaking) (door banging) Would you like a glass of water? Ah, thanks. Thank you. I've made a dent, but you still need a few more cords. Beautiful place you've got here. I stopped by the cottage. Looks like it's been empty for a long time. Everything has its season. How long have you been here? 10 years. You really should get some help around here. You need some new shingles, the windows need glazing. A lot of things. Thanks, I'll make a list. I've got some free time, I don't mind helping out. I managed to take care of myself all these years without your help. I don't think I need it now. I'm not suggesting you do. It's just that I have some time. You never married? I was married, if it's any of your business. He died, a long time ago. I'm sorry. I never knew until today you tried to help Waldo. Would it have made any difference? I don't know. (gentle music) (door bangs) (somber music) So what'd the doctor say? Ah, might as well be practicing in the Dark Ages for all they don't know. They stick you in every conceivable place. Get the test back, they still don't have a clue. So when do you start chemotherapy? I don't, it's too late. Well, that can't be. We'll get a second opinion. The time I have left, I'd just like it to be business as usual. They're not in the kitchen. Look upstairs. I'll find 'em. (footsteps thudding) Glasses, glasses, glasses. Anybody ever tell you about paying bills? (somber music) I can't believe you kept all my letters. (Dane chuckles) (somber music) You're lucky they haven't disconnected your phone. Ah, that's a matter of opinion. Might be easier if I took over paying these bills. Easier for whom? You can't let 'em pile up like this. Why? You think the utility company is gonna go broke just 'cause my check is late? No, but they could turn off your power. It would be one less thing for you to worry about. Who's worried? I remember my name, if that's what you're waiting to see. (soft country music) I'm sure there's somebody you'd rather be looking at than me. I don't need a babysitter if that's what you're worried about. Who's worried? You remember how I used to throw you and your friends out so's I could get a couple hours of peace? Well, consider yourself thrown out. All right, I can take a hint. Hint? (chuckles) Bolt of lightning is just a tap on the shoulder to you. See you later. Much later. Get her to invite you to dinner. (door bangs) (Ren chuckles) (soft country music) (hand knocks) (hand knocks) (door creaks) Hannah? (phone rings) (hands rub) (phone rings) (phone rings) Hello? Is this Hannah Raven's house? Yeah. Who's this? Dane, a friend. I'm here glazing some windows. Who's this? Oh, Gabe Hartell, Hannah's son. Can I talk to my mom? She isn't here. Oh okay, well, could you tell her I'll call back then? And listen, I'm really sorry. It sounds like you're picking up my slack, but does she have enough wood to last till Christmas? No, but I'll make sure she does. I really appreciate it, and I'll return the favor. She's expecting me home for thanksgiving, and I wanna surprise her with something at Christmas, but I can't afford to do both. You've just done me a favor. I've been looking for a present for Hannah, and bringing you home on Thanksgiving would fit the bill just fine. Thanks, but I couldn't. No, I insist. Give me your number, and I'll have my travel agent call you. Okay, it's 617-555-0145. Will I see you there for Thanksgiving? Well, we'll see. Take care. Thanks, you too. (ladder rattles) Hey. Would you like something to eat? Well sure, that'd be great. Give me 10 minutes. Okay. How long have you been selling your art? About 15 years. It's only supported me the last five. What'd you do before that? I worked for a doctor, doing pain therapy. Hot compresses, massages. It's a far cry from art. Not really. The human body is a perfect work of art. And each one is different. (liquid splashing) You never told me you had a son. Why should I? What's he like? His father. Well, you're up to date on my life. Tell me about yours. Not much to tell. After I left here, I got into preservation instead of enforcement. You know, grizzlies, wolves. You never married? No. There have been women, but only one woman. And you came back to see your uncle? Yeah, he's got cancer. It's terminal. Oh, I'm so sorry. He was my son's favorite teacher. Ren? Hmm, yeah, he helped Gabe get a scholarship. Gabe's at Harvard. He wouldn't have gotten in without Ren. Please, if there's anything I can do, please let me know. Yeah. You know, I don't understand you. You're like two different men. One caring, the other heartless. Who are you now? Hannah, I came looking for you the day of the arrest. You disappeared. I believed you. And the whole time you were lying. Hannah, not about my feelings. You've gotta believe that. Why? Well, I was trapped. I had a job to do. Can't you forgive me for something that happened 20 years ago? I forgive you! Look, my life is different now. I have my son and my work, that's enough. Our lives could have been very different. (solemn music) They still could be. Oh, Gabe called. He said he was worried about being able to afford coming home on Thanksgiving, so I took care of it. I hope that's all right. No, no, I don't want you to pay for his ticket. Consider it a belated baby gift. Goodbye. (somber music) (door bangs) Ren? Ren? How's he doing? I don't expect him to leave the hospital, I'm sorry. (Dane sighs) Let him rest. You can see him in the morning. Well, can't I just sit with him? Sure. (seagulls squawking) (monitors beeping) (Ren groaning loudly) Ren? (Ren groans) Ren, you okay? I'll be right back. Dr. Travis, you have a visitor in the main lobby. Oh, nurse. He's in pain, can't you give him something? We have, but it's not having much effect. Well, give him some more. His respiratory system won't tolerate it. I'm sorry. But. (somber music) Hannah? In here. It's Ren, the pain medication isn't working. Can you come? Yeah. Just let me get my coat. He's really bad. Ren? Hmm? Ren, it's Hannah Raven. I'm gonna help you relax your muscles so you can sleep. A little sleep will be good. Where's the pain? Show me. Here. Okay. Family is all that matters. He's sleeping. I think he'll make it through the night. Thanks a lot. One more favor? Here's my problem. (door bangs) I need some advice about where to put this. Oh. Oh, Dane. How about here? Oh wait, let me help. You know I've had this in my studio for the last 20 years? Just put it in the gallery a couple of months ago. I'm starving, how about some dinner? You spend most of your time in the wild. That's where the animals are. Still the lone wolf. (glasses clink) I guess I haven't changed my stripes much. They may be fading a little, however. You know, motherhood suits you. Why do you say that? Well, you seem complete. I'm far from complete, but Gabe has made me very happy. He gave me something to believe in again. Well, I envy you that. I always wanted to be a father. I mean, it was really important to me. Maybe because I lost my own father when I was so young. You're still the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I doubt that your childless state is due to a lack of opportunity. You thought that was a line. (Hannah laughs) Whether it was or not, it was very effective. (gentle music) (lips smacking) I should go. This isn't a good idea. Don't. (lips smacking) (gentle music) (lips smacking) (romantic music) (phone rings) Corvin. Dane, it's Dr. Williamson. I was just with your uncle. He wants to die at home. I'll be right there. Thanks. Could you open the curtains? Sure. Well. Could have asked for a nicer day or better company. I'm sorry I stayed away so long. Oh, I did the same thing myself when I lost Margaret. Cut everybody off, even your father. He wanted me to marry again and I should have. It's not too late for you. I always thought of you as my son. I've loved you. I guess I could love anybody. I couldn't have asked for a better father. I love you, Ren, and I'm gonna miss you. But it's okay to let go. Your work is done. Margaret's waiting. (somber music) (Dane cries) (footsteps thudding) Ren's the only father I ever really knew. My own father's just a shadow. I can't even remember what he looked like. It's good that you had Ren. Yeah, yeah, but I never told him what he meant to me until today. I don't know why. Maybe it's because you were afraid to let him be that important. You'd already lost one father. I'm sure he knew how you felt. I sure hope so. Was he at peace? Yeah, I think he was. And true to form, full of advice for me right up to the end. "Follow your heart," he said, "and you'll find the truth." And he was right. I'm tired of running, Hannah. My heart has always been right here with you. I can't pretend to want somebody else. I never have and I never will. (shoes clacking) (fire crackling) This is my son and my husband. It was taken 15 years ago. Gabe isn't 18, he's almost 20. He's your son. My son? Does he know this? No. He thinks Ted's his father. And you were just gonna let me leave and not tell me? I have to protect Gabe. By lying to him? Look, he loved Ted more than anything. When Ted died, he missed a year of school he was so heartbroken. I missed 20 years of being with my son because of your lying. Your only connection to him is biological. You didn't raise him. I didn't know he existed. You could have come back! I did! You didn't! I did, I came back! That's a lie. Months later. Irene sent me away. She said I had disgraced you, and if I stayed, you'd be shunned. You came back? Hannah, I loved you. Why didn't you find me and tell me? (footsteps thudding) (door banging) (hand knocking) Come in. (door bangs) Been a long time. Goin' somewhere? My uncle died, I'm packing up his stuff. Sorry. (footsteps thudding) Does that mean you're leaving? I don't know what I'm gonna do. I spent years blaming you for everything wrong in my life. I'm not forgiving you for what you did, but I'm willing to let it go, for Hannah's sake. I don't know why, but she still loves you. So I'm asking you to stay and work it out. I have a son who doesn't know I exist. How do I work that out? You left once and you lost my sister. Do it again and you lose her and your son. (somber music) (hand knocks) Come in! (door bangs) I'm glad you came. Are you? I need to talk to you. A month after you left, I found out I was pregnant. Waldo had just gone to prison, and I was so angry. I felt so betrayed by you and confused. The only thing I was sure of is that I never wanted to see you again. I'd known Ted for a long time, he was a friend. I told him that my baby needed a father. I didn't want to raise my child on this island without a name. He married me, and he raised Gabe as his own son. Please, Dane, let Gabe keep the father he remembers. Don't destroy what they had. He's my son, Hannah. What do you know about being a father? You who've never taken care of anyone but yourself? Are you gonna tell him? He's my son. (boat horn honking) Here he comes. Oh, there he is. Ah! (boat horn honks) Looks like he brought his Christmas surprise home early. You know, I don't have to tell him right away. He should have a chance to settle in and get to know me. Oh, I hope so. Oh gosh! Hey, Mom. Hi, sweetheart. And who is this? This is Eileen. Hi. Gabe Hartell. Dane Corvin. I was hoping to meet you. This is my mom's friend I was telling you about. Dane Corvin. Hi. Hi. So I hope everyone is hungry. Starving, as usual. Yes. Hey, thanks for the ticket. Looks perfect. A ha! (lips smacking) Mom, you could try to make a little more noise next time. I'll try to remember that. Gabe. Would you like to carve? Sure. (Gabe sighs) You would love Boston, Mom. It's a beautiful city. Yeah, just wait until it snows. Eileen's from LA. Oh, I love LA. I was there last fall. Oh yeah? Yeah, I love it too. Mom was just down there doing a one-woman show. Really? Where you from, Mr. Corvin? Dane, please. Seattle. Is that where you live now? No, I live a lot of places. I'm in animal preservation, and that keeps me in the field. Wow, that's cool. What are you working on now? Documenting the Alaskan wolf population. How do you do that? I fly over sectors and record the packs. Once in the spring and again in the fall. Well, the view must be incredible. Yeah, it is. I'd love to see that. Well, that's easy. Come up with me anytime. Could I? Of course. I'd love that. There was a storm last night. Should be good hunting tomorrow. Yeah. Agates, Gabe collects them. You mean the rock? Yeah, yeah, they wash up on the beach behind the house. Kinda hard to see, but I can show you if you like. Sure. After you do your chores. I knew it, I knew it! That's gotta be a new world record. I've been home for what, two hours now. Already I'm getting the list. Did I give you a list? Did anyone at this table see me give him a list? I know it's here somewhere. (Hannah laughs) You did a wonderful job raising Gabe. He's a great kid. Then don't destroy him. The truth won't destroy him. It didn't destroy me, it didn't destroy you. It's destroyed us. Ren knew, didn't he? If he did, he never said so. He didn't know him that well. He knew. That's why he was trying to get us back together. There's one thing I want. It's the only favor I'll ever ask. Let me tell him myself. How's it feel being home? It's great. You know, I like Boston, but this will always be home. You're not getting too grown up to miss your mother, are you? No, I'll never be too grown up for that. (Hannah laughs) Are you seeing Dane? No. You never go out without anyone anymore. He's a cool guy. Maybe you should reconsider. We're old friends, I knew him a long time ago. I never thought I'd see him again. Here, hold that thought. Here, I got it. Help me. (hand knocks) (loud rock music) (hand knocks) Come in. Hi. Hi, Gabe. Are you looking for Mom? Yeah, as a matter of fact I am. Well, she just took Eileen into town, but they shouldn't be too long. Did you take these? Yeah, yeah. I got up early this morning and shot off a few rolls. They're beautiful. Thanks. What's your major? Well, I haven't decided, but it's gonna be something pre-law. You don't look like the lawyer type. What about photography? I wish, it's just not practical though, you know. Artists and journalists, they don't make much money. I guess money's pretty important. Well, you know Mom's given up so much for me. I just want to make sure she's taken care of. As an attorney, I can do that. I'm sure she wouldn't want you to make that kind of sacrifice. You know, she could have left here and had a big career, but she stayed for me. So now it's my turn to take care of her. I'll keep shooting pictures, just in my spare time. (tool scrapes) (owl hoots) You should have come for the walk, Mom. Oh, the stars here are incredible. We're gonna go inside and make some tea. Do you want some? Sure! Gabe! Yeah? Could I talk to you a minute? Okay. Sure, I'll go put the water on. Okay. Wow, that's beautiful, what is it? It's an eagle crest panel. I'm making it for Tam Inias. What's up? A long time ago, before you were born, I met someone. Was that before you fell in love with Dad? Yes. And did you love him? Very much. But it didn't mean I didn't love Ted. I did, I just loved him in a different way. It was Dane, wasn't it? Yes. Well, I don't see what the big deal is. I mean, it was before Dad, so what does it matter? Oh, I guess it doesn't. I just... I just wanted you to know that I loved him. Okay. Anything else? No. Sugar? Plain. Okay. (door bangs) Anybody home? (tool bangs) If you want to ruin his life, you'll have to do it yourself. Damn it, Hannah! You don't care about anybody but yourself. It's not like that! It is like that! (tool banging) Gabe! Yeah. Hey, I was just cleaning up. Good, how about showing me those agates? Yeah, sure, great day for it. They're usually a lot easier to find a couple days after a storm clears out. Start that way, here by the water. Did you like growing up here on the island? Oh yeah, it was the best. I'm gonna bring my kids up somewhere just like it. Looks like a rock. Hold it up to the light. Wow, I'll be darned. That's fantastic. If you could change one thing about your life, what would that be? Well, I wish my father hadn't died. I mean, aside from it being really rough on Mom, I just feel like I kind of missed out. I mean, don't get me wrong, I mean, Mom was great and your uncle showed a real interest. Mom told me, I'm sorry. Yeah, so am I. Well, when I get married, I'm gonna make sure nothing happens to me. I just don't want my wife and kids to have to go through with what we did. Well, life is a little more complicated than that, Gabe. You can't predict the future. No, but I'll sure weigh any option against my family's wellbeing. They'll always be my first priority. Gabe, there's something I gotta tell you. Is it about my mother? Yeah. You love her. Yeah. She loves you too. Thank you, for putting a smile I've never seen on her face before. (gentle music) You've done your father proud. Let me give you a little advice on his behalf. You've got your whole life ahead of you. Do what you want to do. And don't worry about your mother. If what you said is true then that's my job now. (gentle music) (tense music) (door creaks) Hi, where's Eileen? She's in her room. Great. (seagulls squawking) You were right, I don't have to tell him. I mean, I can always be there for him as a father, and he'll just think of me as a friend. (romantic music) I love you! (lips smacking) Don't leave. Not a chance. (Hannah laughs) (lips smacking) (Dane laughs) (gentle music) (dynamic music)
