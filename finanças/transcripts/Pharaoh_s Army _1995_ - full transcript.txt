[Shoveling] [Birds chirping] In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground. For out of it we was taken. Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. Heavenly father, pick this child up on the healing side. Put the grave behind for the promise on the other side, that she might live and abide with you. Boy as old man: When sister died, there weren't none but women and old men to bury her. All of the able-bodied men had gone off to fight the Civil War. I know something about the Civil War. The story I'm about to tell is true as best I remember it. We buried sister in the spring of 1862. Later that night, some Yankee bastards dug her up and tossed her out like a rag doll, on account of Paps siding with the South. In these Cumberland mountains down near the Tennessee line, half the folks sided with the South. The other half sided with the North. The neighbors turned against their neighbors, and it was rough through here. Giddyup. Whoa. We heard. We can bury her again. Israel can stand guard. We're gonna take her home. There'll be hell to pay. So we brung sister back home to our place Up at the end of Meshack Creek. Ma was mad about things. She held it in, And we went on With the work of feeding ourselves. [Talking to mule] [Horses whinny] Mama! Man: Whoa! Mama, men coming. Yankees. They'll steal everything we got. Will they hurt us? Maybe not. Go on! Go on! [Cow bell clanging] Are you Sarah Anders? I am. Ma'am, they say your husband's fighting against his country. We have orders to resupply With contraband from the enemy. That means we'll take forage provisions from you. We got some hungry boys down in Cumberland Gap. I apologize for your hardship. How many you got here with you? How many? Me and my boy. Where is he? Boy, you go stand by your mother. Sarah: Come here. Come here. Ma'am, I will not hurt you or your boy, if you give us no trouble. All right. Take no prisoners. You got a nice place. [Gunshot] I got a piece of bottomland across the River. Ohio River. Brown County, Ohio. Raise hogs, corn, sorghum, mostly. You should stay there. [Gunshot] Ma'am? Captain? Uh, there weren't no hams in the smokehouse. And there's no cows or pigs in the stall. Just cow shit and pig shit. Well, see what's in there. Mmm. Bread. [Hen clucks] [Braying] She don't own nigs. He work like them. What you think he is fighting for? Keep us from stealing his chickens? That's a good reason. [Growls] Shit! Johnny dog. [Kiss] Neely, meet the elephant. Shit... That a fresh grave? I'll tell where our cow is. Well, I've seen all kinds of hiding places. [Cowbell clangs] She's up there. [Gunshot] Rodie! Newt! Captain? A cow is up there somewheres. Neely, Chicago, come on up. Captain, we take the mule? Uhh... No. Ma'am, I apologize for the things this war makes. Ugh... Aah! Newt! Oh! Oh, no! Newt! I fell off! I fell off! I fell off! Roll him on his side. Rodie, keep that leg still! All right, somebody... Somebody get him something to bite. Oh, no! No! Here, Newt, chew on this. You all ready? 1, 2, 3! Oh, no! Let's get him to the house. [Screaming] It hurts! It hurts. Spin him! [Newt shrieking] There's a damn dog under the bed. Well, I'll kill the sum'bitch! Captain: Neely, rip up that pillowcase! Yes, sir. Ma'am, you got some liniment oil? No. You got some whisky? No. Well, can you boil water? Get the turpentine out of the harness shed. Rodie, get some water. Neely, light that damn fireplace. Hold still! [Men coughing] What's she got up there? A ham and a rifle. Captain? Man: All right, all right, soldier. [Vulture screeching] All right, all right. Settle down. It burns, don't it? Well... You want a chew? No. Look, he's sweating. We can't move him until the fever breaks. You can sleep in there if you want to. I told the men to sleep in the barn. I'm gonna keep ahold of this musket of yours. I don't like this at all... Staying here. We've got plenty to eat. Yeah... Maybe them buzzards will, too. [Speaking Polish] Boy: Is he gonna die? Like Jesse? If the skinny Yankee gets well... he might be the one shooting at your pap. You wash your face? One day... your pap will come around up the creek. Until then, you're the man around here. You need to sleep. Got to bear up. [Snoring] Captain? It's me, Rodie. Damn, Neely. Captain, the woman's gone. The woman's gone? Mm-hmm. You should try and get some sleep. I'll look for her. Yes, sir. Elephant... Elephant. [Knock knock] Who's there? It's me. Corporal Neely said you was gone. Am I under arrest? Who's buried here? Excuse me for asking. First Yankee that dies in Altmara, I'm gonna go down. And I'm gonna dig up the son of a bitch. We buried her in Altmara. The Yankees living down there wouldn't abide that... Her mixed in with their damn Yankee kin. Your daughter? They dug her up. We brought her back here. Her pap don't even know. She smelled so bad. There'll be hell to pay. [Sobbing] [Chicago "introducing" himself to audience in Polish] Rodie? Yeah? Use the damn outhouse. Sir? There's a woman about. Yes, sir. It burns like hell, don't it? Damn, it hurts. Well, it's supposed to, now. Is that fresh milk? He can't keep the hard stuff down. [Newt coughing] Thank you, ma'am. [Boy talking to mule] Whoa, whoa. Well, the Yankees could steal what we had. But not what we hadn't got yet. So I was determined to put in next year's corn crop. I was young but I was stout, and I could handle a mule as well as any man. Your reins are too tight. That's why she's drifting. Whoa, whoa. You need three fingers of slack right here. I got a matched pair of sorrel mules back home That turn on a skinny dollar. Must be about 10, huh? 11. That old, huh? Put some salt in his feed, And you might get A couple more crop years out of her. Come on, come on! The Yankee captain asked if he could turn a few rows. I didn't see the harm in it. It made my job easier, you see. And that morning was the first I seen mama wear her green dress to the plow field. Captain: Hyah! Hyah! How's Newt? You ain't been in to see him? Cain't. Bad luck. This is not bad luck. He is not dead. It's a gut wound. Ain't nothing you can do. What's he doing out there? Captain: Whoa, whoa, whoa. He is a widower. He's, um... Brushing off the cobwebs. He ain't much of a soldier. Whoa, whoa. Thank you, sir. Where's your husband fighting? The army of Tennessee. Was he at Shiloh? Yeah. That was a bad mess. You was there? No... No. No, we never been in a big scrape. "Meet the elephant," boys call it. Ma'am, last night, What you said about your little girl. I'm real sorry. Sorry don't do nothing. Don't stop you from taking our cow or ham, Killing our chickens. Well, you have a corn crop. Some have it worse. So that's it? You's out here blistering up your hands To make you feel better about stealing from us? If I was you, I'd take advantage. These blisters can't hold out much longer. Captain: Come on. Ahem. What? Hell, Neely, they were starting to smell. Go ahead. Smell. You can't leave dead chickens in a rucksack for 2 days! Corporal! Uh... Uh, captain? Corporal. Them chickens are starting to smell. Well, pluck 'em. Uh, pluck 'em, sir? How do you do this? - I ain't. - I might. They say you cannot know who does and who don't. It will surprise you. You ain't running from the elephant, are you? Me? Yeah, you. No. You get shot a lot easier showing them your backside. And you know something about this? I joined up to fight. No... No, I ain't running. Yeah, I know something about it. Rodie, we ain't soldiers. We are chicken thieves. You kiss my brown spot. I joined up to fight. My brother saw action. Wildcat, mule springs, Shiloh. He said you become a new man, with your first shot. Dead and dying... hardly get a passing thought. Become cool and deliberate. [Gunshots] [Gunshot] Captain! Corporal? You hear it? Hear what? Gunfire. Whoa, whoa. What? There was shooting from over there. Squirrel hunters most likely. Go ride over and find out. Ride over? Might run straight up to an ambush. I'm in charge. Neely, only reason you got that stripe is you too bold-ass dumb to think for yourself. Are you a general? General, huh? No, just a captain. How many men you killed? You really want to know? None. Rodie? What? You feel cool and deliberate? Nothing's moving. Damn. We should... We should bury them. We'd have to hang around to do that. You want to hang around? Hyah! Want a chew? Thank you. [Horses neigh] Captain. There was a farm burnt down. Some old man and his wife were killed. Where? There. No more than 5 Miles up the creek. You know whose place it is? Yankees. Ma'am, they weren't Yankees. Just some old farmer and his wife. They sent two boys into the Union army. They were just farmers. Like I said, the war was rough through here. How'd you sleep? You're going to be fine, soldier. Uh, how's Newt? We're out of turpentine. Captain, what do we do? Oh... I don't know. We need to feed the boys back at the Cumberland Gap. And that old farmer and his wife. We should report back that there's some guerrilla outfit running around killing Unionists. I think we got to wait Newt out. He's too sick to ride. We could hitch up the wagon to the mule, haul Newt out. Giddyup, giddyup. I won't let that woman and boy root hog or starve. No. No, sir. Whoa. Will you let me do that? I don't need your help. Well, I like working with mules. How's your hands? Blisters on top of blisters. Let me see. Let me see. All right. That's fine. Thank you. Come on! I told you I got you. I told you. Captain, Newt took a poop. I guess that's a good sign. Rodie, make sure you clean up this porch. My stomach hurts. Worse than yesterday? Mm-mmm. Oh, you'll be fine. You're not as hot. How's he doing? He's fine. I'll make you some sassafras tea. She's pretty. You are feeling better. [Laughing] [Spits] Ohh... Hey, Johnny, I'm sorry. You crossed my artillery line there. Here, I'll let you spit back. Go ahead. You're scaring the boy. No, he ain't scared. Are you, Johnny? Go ahead... Spit. Neely: Rodie, you got a mean streak. Cool and deliberate. [Coughing and gagging] [Wheezing] Captain? Neely. Uh, chicken's cooked. Yes, yes. I told you it was going to get burnt. Pow... Pow. Chicago: You are looking rather well this evening. Leave him alone! Go to hell. Chicago: Rodie! Hey, hey, hey! Is she crazy, captain? Bastard! Rodie hit her dog. That damn Johnny dog ate my food, captain. Soldier, I want you to apologize. I'm telling you, captain, that woman is crazy. If you want another plate, you'll apologize. She hit me with a damn bucket! Common decency tells you you don't pick up a woman and throw her against a wall! Private, you're dismissed! Sir! Hope you get a piece. What'd you say, soldier? Rodie, shut up. Spent your whole damn day, what? Plowing her corn. You cut her wood. I'm sure she thinks you're a damn good samaritan. You know what I think? I think you just want a little poke. Rodie! Rodie, stop it! Come on, Rodie! Rodie! I hope you kills each other. You rot in hell. You rot in hell! Come here. Come here. We can't just sit by. I want you to go tonight, to preacher's house. And tell him that there's Yankees here, and he should get word to our people. Don't talk to anyone but preacher. And you have to be back before sunup. - You understand me? - Yes, ma'am. These are yours. Go on. And I'm sorry. There was some... ugly things said tonight about... They weren't true. No? Don't think they were true. Your little girl died, and... Well, my wife died 3 years ago. I miss her. Miss my farm, my boy. I come here to your place, and it looks a lot like my place... We ain't gonna be friends. Let's just keep to being enemies. Yes, ma'am. I forgot. You have a better memory. Ahem... Is Newt asleep? Yeah. You know, I don't think Rodie mean to be disrespecting. His brother was killed by a rebel sniper. He get crazy thinking about it. He's... Where are you from? Chicago. No, I mean before that. This small village in Poland. It's just very small. You damn foreigner. Why get mixed up in this? I think I get to see new places, I get tired of chopping sausage. Pretty thin reason to get shot at. You got a better one? I've heard your big reasons. To save the union. This is what the generals say. To free the slaves? Nobody that I know want to get killed to free a bunch of nigs. It's a mess, ain't it? Why did you... Sign up? Minister. Brought a runaway slave into our church and ripped off his shirt. Showed off the ugliest damn strap scars. Right there from the pulpit, the minister asked for volunteers, and I stood up, and here I am... Stealing chickens. Hold on! Preacher: Who's there, Israel? It's Miss Anders' boy. They came up the creek on horses. How many Yankees is there? 4... 5. Which? 5. One's hurt real bad. Pharaoh sent his army to smite Israel. And they drowned in the Red Sea. It was wrong what they done to your sister. God's will is a powerful thing. Mama, mama. Where's your shoes? What did preacher say? What? That's it's going to be all right. Is he going to get word to our people? To your pap? I think so. Don't be so thick. What did he say? I can't understand him. Rodie, you can get shot for desertion. You ain't gonna do it. What makes you so sure? Because... You ain't sure. You ain't no killer. They wouldn't send no fighting man To rob widows and orphans. You can't even do that. Rodie? If you desert... I'll kill you. Got to go, captain. Rodie. Rodie! Stop! [Gunshot] [Gunshot] Shit! A sniper! God dang it, get down! Get inside, get inside! Come on! Go, go! What is it? Newt, keep your head down! It's a damn sniper. Is it pap? I don't know. Just keep still. [Gunshots] Captain: What the hell are you all shooting at? We can't see the sons of bitches! It's the elephant. It is. It's just a damn sniper. I believe he's up on that hill. Anybody here hurt? You know who's up there? You know who's out there? Pap. [Gunshot] You need to say something? You think Rodie's dead? I don't know. Captain? What are we going to do? You's all as good as dead. It's time to meet the elephant. I'll need one of you... to keep a gun on these... Rebs. And I need the other to cause a faint. Faint... What is? It's a decoy to draw the enemy's fire. Chicago, I think you better do the decoy. Here. Yes, sir, captain. You shoot them if they try to run for it. Shoot? Ready... Go, go! Get on! Get out! [Gunshots] [Gunshots] [Gunshots] [Speaking Polish] [Gunshots] [Gunshots] [Gunshots] [Gunshots] Hold it! Aah! Aah! Aah! What the hell? Chicago: It's a nig. Neely: Shooting for the wrong side. # When the reaping is done # # And the harvest is o'er # # At the feet of the son # We will labor no more # Serving faithfully... You killed my boy. And he killed a federal soldier. You'll burn in hell for your sins. Then I guess we'll meet again. Next time don't send your boy. Fight your own fights, you rebel bastard. # When the reaping is done # We ought to string up that damn rebel preacher. # And the harvest is o'er # # At the feet of the son # We will labor no more # Serving faithfully You get that wagon and mule ready. We're hauling Newt out of here. # What a Joy it will be # When the reaping is done # Hey! [Speaking Polish] You can't take our mule. Oh, get him away from her! Get him away! Stop it. Get him away! Stop bein' so damn stubborn! All right? They're dead! They're dead! You son of a bitch! You hear me? You stop that! Boy... Get away from me! Boy, you get! There'll be hell to pay. Yeah, you said that before. Go on in there. Make sure she don't strangle Newt. Yes, sir, captain. Hitch up that mule, bring the wagon around. Yes, sir. We're getting out of here, Newt. I'm gonna miss the dog. Shit... Ahh! Sorry, Newt. Captain, we are ready. Should we say some words? You say it for yourself. Bye, Rodie. Giddyup! What do you expect us to eat? Ma'am. I says, what do you expect us to eat? Ma'am, that husband of yours... Why don't you bring him home? We'll all eat good. I'm leaving your rifle. Maybe the boy can shoot squirrels. Ma'am, I took your powder. Let's go. I thought she was sweet on him. No, you can't trust johnnies. Come on, mule. Whoa, shit! What the hell happened? [Gunshots] I want you both to stay here. Yes, sir. What's he doing? I think he's wanting to kill somebody. Ohh! What'd you do? What'd you do? I shot. Shot what? I heard shooting. I shot a Yankee. Do they know it was you? Do they? I don't know. Come on! Come on! Sarah Anders! Did you forget something? Newt was shot about a mile down the creek. - You know anything about it? - No. Where's your boy? I sent him up the spring. Boy! Come here! Your pants are wet. I was up at the spring. He was up at the spring. Come here, boy. Come here! Now, did you kill Newt? You look at him. Did you kill Newt? Your mother might tell you that it's all right to kill Yankees. But I just want you to know that that boy... He had a brother just like you. And he had a family just like you! And he never hurt a fly in his life! And he wouldn't be dead If you hadn't come down here stealing from us! We was doing fine until you showed up. Don't blame it on... Go ahead... Kill us. You know it scares me. 'cause I could. I really could. I just hope whoever killed Newt... Has the common decency to give him a Christian burial. What'd you do to them? You heard the shots. [Thunder rumbles] Damn... [Thunder rumbles] Get that damn Yankee out of our yard. The captain asked us to do the decent thing. I don't guess the Civil War was about being decent. We dug up the big redhead and floated him down Meshack Creek. Ma said he come up that creek to cause trouble, and we sent him back down where he come from. We drug the skinny Yankee up a hill to a sinkhole. Where a big sycamore tree had fallen over and turned up its roots. We throwed the skinny Yankee in the sinkhole, throwed some dirt on him. I don't guess Ma hated the skinny Yankee as much as the big redhead. [Thunder rumbles] Pap never made it back. That war was a widow-maker. Ma told me to never never tell anyone What we had done. And I don't think I ever did... Except maybe once, or maybe twice. [Rain falling] # Temptation ceased # Calling her song # The road to the battle lays down # # Sweet Jesus, sweet child # # Take this one here # We give it to you this day # # When the reaping is done # When we labor no more # When the reaping is done # When we labor no more # When the reaping is done this day # # Sweet Jesus, sweet child # # Take this one here # We give it to you this day # # We give it to you this day #
