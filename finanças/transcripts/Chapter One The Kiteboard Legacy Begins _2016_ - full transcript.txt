Subtitles by explosiveskull Weather is big news, this morning, an unusual weather bulletin. It's a storm that developed really rapidly. Northern Ireland and Northern Britain, parts of the Republic are bringing gusts of up to 70 miles per hour. Massive thunderstorms intensifying explosively in a process known as bombogenesis started to hit northern parts of the UK and Ireland on Wednesday. leaving thousands... Travel was disrupted and there were restrictions and closures of bridges. While on the rail many services had to be canceled. In the western islands 17,000 homes were evacuated. At least one coast guard categorized the sea state as phenomenal. It's the technical term for as rough as it gets. Extremely large waves around northern and western coasts, bringing wintry showers to Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Republic, and Northern England. It's not just very windy, huge waves are crushing in to the coast as well. I've ridden quite some storms in my life. But the forecast that we have on the radar now is something I've never seen before. They're already calling it Black Wednesday. Seventy knots of wind. So the chase is on. It ended up in a disappointing session actually. We didn't get the jumps in that we hoped for. Just not getting what you were hoping for. It hurts. What I didn't know, is that the biggest storm of my life was yet to come. Hawaii is pretty incredible. There's a lot of diversity in the geography. Especially on a place like Maui. Maui's got about four of five different climates. From the rain forest on the east side of the island, to the near desert on the south side. To Haleakala which is 10,000 feet. You've all these microclimates on the way up the crater. So it's a pretty diverse landscape. But the thing about it, mainly, is that it really is the ultimate water sports place. Surfing in Hawaii, it's something that, while being a very solo type of sport, it's also very social. Everybody is out in the water, and it's a way that... you catch up with people. It's almost a bit of a ritual for a lot of people. Hawaii is a really unique place. It's the furthest away island chain from any major landmass in the world. It's seven major islands that are volcanic. So, they basically pop up in the middle of this vast desert of ocean, you would call it. The aloha spirit as it's called is kind of the island's style. People live on what they call Hawaiian time here. So, not in a big hurry, you know, pretty mellow. There's still a sense here of calm, compared to most places. That's I think just natural from the environment and the lifestyle. If you look at the people that live in Hawaii there's always been a lot of free time. A lot of people live here because of the lifestyle that Hawaii provides. So, the ocean has always been an integral part of it. So, even if you're working, you work to make enough money you could get in the water and surf or something. I was really really lucky that my dad was one of those people, that in the sixties was willing to just throw everything through conventional way, and follow his dreams, and take the family and move to Hawaii, with no real guarantee of what the future was gonna be like. He wanted to live somewhere where he was free and close to the water, and be able to surf. Just took the risk and went for it. He took a teaching job and moved to where he could surf, fortunately. Having a bunch of kids and living on a teacher's salary. We weren't hippies, but we were definitely following the dream, rather than living the established life. Once I got into windsurfing in 1974 he started windsurfing as well. And that gradually took over everything else. And so my dad started making boards in the garage. It soon became more than just a hobby. Naish Hawaii started for a couple of decades, that was the name of the game. The very first kiters were all windsurfers. When we started developing the sport, even the earliest guys like Don Montague, Pete Cabrinha, we were all coming from the windsurfing world. That's where we brought our experience, technology and know-how... the knowledge of wind and waves, and how to improve this stuff to make it really work. When I first saw kite boarding, one of the first things that attracted me to it, was the fact that you could get huge, ridiculous air. If you look at how we started kite surfing in the surf it was an amazing way to get air and jump. Huge jumps off nothing. But pretty rapidly behind us was a succession of young guys. This was their first sport that they really got into. Those guys have taken the torch that we handed them with this new sport. And they have developed it into the sport that it is today. There aren't that many places in terms of perfect kite surfing wave riding conditions, where it's the right wind speed, wind direction and swell direction. so everything lines up. Even here on Maui, we don't have that great kite wave riding conditions. It's really good kiting, but we don't have any spot that's like the full-on down the line perfect wave to kite. So, basically to go ride really good waves on a kite even we have to travel. If you want surf, you have to chase it. And the whole southern hemisphere, especially down by Antarctica, produces large storms, that send swells up to all of these islands. Fiji is a pretty insane place, a whole lot of islands popping out of the water. Super volcanic, and some of the most perfect set-ups for surfing I've ever seen. There's this part of Fiji, that in really like a five mile radius, has possibly five or six world class surf spots. There's all these reef passes that are lined up perfectly with the wind. Like point breaks, long sweeping, arching reefs, where the waves wrap and bend around the reef. Everything about traveling is really just a series of reveals. Even to the point of taking the boat out to cloud break, you can't see the surf until you get right up to it. So as you get close and closer... you start to see waves, and then you start to see exactly what it's gonna do, what you're gonna get. And when we saw that it was fiery with wind and swell, and nobody out, we just could not believe our minds. For people like Robby and myself, we evolved all from surfing to windsurfing to kite surfing. But for kids like Keahi, kite surfing came along at a early age for him. So, you might say he's really kind of the first generation of riders that grew up with kite surfing as their main sport. Growing up as the sport progressed around me was pretty cool. I had the opportunity to basically pick a style... try my best to kind of help shape the way the sport is. I see something kind of brewing on the forecast. It seems to be changing. Day by day the forecast is growing for the cloud break area. So, what started off as a swell in the five to six foot range grew to eight to ten foot, and now they're calling it 14 to 15 foot. Looking like pretty amazing conditions are lining up. It looks like really solid waves, good wind. I think a few guys have seen that as well. I think Jesse Richman is coming over, as well as Robby Naish. In the summer months I'm pretty much always keeping an eye on the weather forecast for the South Pacific and Hawaii. You know, Hawaii, Fiji, Tahiti. Even Micronesia, and the forecast for this trip was just perfect. As good as it gets. It's hard to find a wave that gets really big and has the perfect wind direction that gives you the opportunity, actually to ride it. As on Maui last week it seemed like the ticket. This swell looked big, it was perfectly lined up with pretty much everything. And it just looked like it was gonna be one of those swells that you could rip with a kite. Riding waves this big, just put everything in a perspective. Because it's, you know, 30 foot wall of water, possibly, coming at you. And at cloud break is not just a wall, but it's a building collapsing. And it's so thick, so heavy, so wide, juicy, like you look into the barrel and you could fit a school bus in there. Run. It's interesting when it comes to safety. You've got a kite and you've got a tool that can essentially, pull you out of bad situations. You wipe out, you keep the kite in the air. But at the same time you're attached to a kite that has 20 meter lines. When you crash, things can go seriously wrong. Things are gonna go wrong, things are gonna go bad, it's not gonna be a pretty sight for a moment there. But that's what I love, is finding that line between pure adrenaline stoke high to another dimension and just getting the beating of your life. Run. Kite surfing has to be one of the best traveling adventure sports of all time. It's an incredible vehicle for just experiencing the world and finding places that you'd never experience any other way. Brazil is the perfect place to train. Just because there's wind every single day they have trade winds here. So, that means it blows pretty much all year round. You have perfect lagoons around all of the beaches. If you just drive down the coast, you'll find many many lagoons that have been untouched. And they're just perfect for kiteboarding, because they're butter flat and the wind hits them with no obstacles in the way. So, when I got invited to Uruau by Youri I was super stoked, because I've respected him since I was really young and really loved his riding. And always wanted to be as good as him. And yeah, to get to go and ride with him for a few days is pretty sick. Normally two competitors won't go out and train together mid year, when they're both still in the race for the world championship. I invited Liam over to Uruau, to my home spot here in Brazil, even though we're fierce competitors in the world tour. We compete the whole year against each other. I still decided to ask him to come over since I think he's one of the best riders out there at the moment. I'm really trying to push the sport into the next level. And I think if we ride together we can actually achieve that. Tricks that we're doing now are harder than ever before. Just have to get into a certain state of mind. And you don't get into that state of mind every single day. It just comes with time. You can be training every day for a week, for months, and you'll just get into that flow, every once in a while. But when you get into that rhythm, then you really feel something different. You can visualize all of your tricks much better, and you can really feel that you're gonna land them. Yeah, that's when you pull off things, that you never expected to do. Ever since 2004 I've been coming here to Brazil, especially Cumbuco. I've seen very young talent, local kids from the town and from Cauipe. They've been inviting me well. And every year there was one kid that was basically standing out a little bit more over the others. Three years ago I came to Brazil and I arrived in the lagoon, and so this kid was just doing every single trick that all of us pro's were doing at the highest level. So, that was pretty amazing, to see a kid come out of nowhere and suddenly just beat every single guy on tour. At the moment I'm ranked number one in the world and Bebe is ranked number two. We're really close on points. Yeah, I guess he's a threat to me as he's riding so good. Everything that I was doing was just kind of ordinary, I felt like... And I wanted to switch it up and do something different. So, a friend gave me a sailboat, I decided to fix it up, and sail it up to the British Virgin Islands, the windward islands in the Caribbean. Just get away from everything, the day-to-day grind, you know. Not having a return ticket or a flight back... and not knowing where you're going from there is super different. And a different way to live. Living off the sailboat in the way I have only dreamed, is priceless. I don't have any rent, I can anchor wherever I want, and live off the simple things in life instead of all this stuff that we really don't need. It's a strange feeling parking your boat in front of Necker Island... Richard Branson's island. There's a big contrast of owning a private island and living on a little sailboat. But living the same dream and being so close together... it feels like we're neighbors. I believe that people who kite are much more connected to nature than almost any other people I've ever met. There's an enormous amount of effort, put up by the kiting community to protect our species. On Necker Island, there are more species than on any other island of its size in the world. And every corner you turn you're gonna run across something, whether it's a flock of flamingo's, whether it's giant iguana's that you only find on this island and one other island. So Necker is rich in species, both on the island and under the seas, just off the island. One of the reasons we bring these species to Necker, is some of them are CITES 1, the most endangered species on Earth. And Necker is the perfect place for them to breed. We've had tremendous success with all the species we've brought here, in reproducing them so that these particular species will never die out. Look, I'm a great believer that if you can keep fit and healthy you can achieve pretty well anything in life, and if you let your body go the reverse is true. And one of the best ways of keeping a fit mind and keeping a fit body is getting out there on the water. And the more time you can spend on the water the better. I first came to Necker Island eight years ago, I would say. I just came to kite, I didn't even know who Richard Branson was. I didn't even know this island existed. I've just been lucky I've been invited back ever since. I first kited about 14 years ago. I now find kiting, the best sport in the world. I just get away from, you know, the hustle and bustle of life. And just bounce over the waves. Kite boarding gives you so many things that it's hard to say which one thing is what motivates you to get out every day. Some people do it to break away, some people do it to relax. Other people just do it for the sport or the adrenaline. It really depends I think it's more like keeping your mind active, keeping your and body active. Those are the two of the things, once you get hooked on that, you need that every day. Kite boarding provides that. The sport is so diverse that, you know, even when you feel like you've done a lot of one thing, and then break into something completely new and that changes the game completely. Essentially foiling just means that you're picking the actual board that you're riding on out of the water and you're riding a little wing, it's literally like riding a magic carpet. One of the nice things about kiting is that anybody can do it and pretty well anybody can afford to do it. And all you need is the wind, and you just go where the wind wants to take you. I mean, Necker Island attracts adventurers. And maybe because, you know, I've spent my lifetime trying to break world records and it was wonderful, for instance, to have Nick here, who decided he wanted to jump off the highest point of Necker Island, which just happened to be the Jacuzzi on the roof of Necker Island. And try to kite down into the sea. Oh, you're going to do it from the top? I'll see how it feels. If it feels good, then I probably will. All right. You're trying to land on the board, are you? Yeah. Probably slightly further back, or... - No, I think this is perfect. - Yeah? Okay. Let's do it. All right. Okay. I'm just going to try and sit. See how it feels. One minute. - One minute. - Okay. All right, 15 seconds. Nick standing by. Okay, guys. Nick's ready on the roof. Three, two, one... Launch. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! This city. Of all cities, knows the dream of freedom. Freedom, to me, is just jumping on my board and grabbing my kite and cruising out into the bay. When I go kite surfing, it's just meditation, almost. I don't think about anything else. I'm just super relaxed. Just going with nature, cruising along. And you know, after a hard day at work, or whatever I'm trying to solve, if I can just get on the water for 20 minutes, that completely relaxes me. When Robby Naish, Pete Cabrinha and myself started kitesurfing I was really interested in kite design, kite development. I've been designing kites now since 1997. I got a lot of input over the years how kite surfing can change people's lives, change our lifestyles. And I really wanted to bring that to another realm. But the feeling of kite surfing is amazing. And I wanted to share that with everyone. And so I started working on different platforms... seeing what I could pull from sailing canoes to small catamarans. And that led me into the kite boat project which I'm now working on. For the last ten years, we've made nine different boats. Probably 15 different sets of foils, a hundred different prototypes of kites. The mission now is to cross from here to Hawaii in record pace. That's the next thing, the next chapter in my life, is to cross this ocean. I discussed my project with Larry Page and Sergey Brin from Google. And they said, "Why not, instead of sailing around the world, you save the planet?" So, they proposed to build a renewable energy company, using kites to generate electricity. And that's how we started in 2006. And we started small, we started with soft kites, and worked our way into rigid wings. To explain how the Makani system works, if you've ever flown a kite and you've actually looped your kite, you can feel that force against you. Pulling against you. And so, what Makani's doing is just basically taking that force and turning it into electricity. One of the unique features of Makani's wing, is that they can go to a higher altitude, than a conventional turbine. Mostly because of the wind gradient, there's more wind up higher. And just tapping into that area that isn't being used at the moment, Makani is going to be able to take high altitude wind and help power the earth. After chasing a crazy big storm in Ireland, Ruben and I decided to keep an eye out on the conditions. We wanted to chase more storms and maybe even crazier winds, bigger waves, and then all of a sudden I got a phone call with some terrible news. It's actually crazy how quickly things can go downhill. From feeling happy, strong, powerful... to experiencing chest pains and symptoms, losing energy. The first symptoms that I got to experience was in Maui. I was feeling massive chest pains and short of breath. I could barely walk up a hill, without stopping every five meters. But I never thought anything major of it. I thought it was like the flu or just an inflammation, or whatever. The doctors came to the conclusion, that I was dealing with a tumor right behind my heart, in between my lungs. When I heard that for the first time, I freaked out. I thought my life was over. As soon as they told me it was treatable and curable... you immediately switch to survival mode. And you just do what you have to do. And that was chemo therapy. Putting poison in my body, was something horrific. This seemed like the only solution, as the tumor was already pressing on my nerves and my vessels. This cancer thing has definitely given me new perspectives on what I'm here for, and what I love doing. Just focus on things that resonate with you and just going with the flow. That all sounds easy, but we tend to get caught up in the everyday life, and take things for granted. What happened to Ruben, made me realize, that it's very important to decide where and how you want to spend your time. For me it's very important to live my life as natural as possible. And one of the things is to escape the crazy, busy city lifestyle. You know, I love coming to Indonesia. Especially traveling here together with my sister is just something magical, you know. No T-shirt team. Kev and I, we've always been super close since the start. Like, doing the same sport. He kind of got me into kite boarding. We've always been very competitive with each other. And especially for my side. He's always a little bit better and I'm always trying to achieve the same. I used to be a very shy person when I was younger. Kevin was always there, and he always took good care of me. But I was always kind of in his shadows. But it also made me very strong because without him, I probably never would have pushed myself so far as I do now. I'm super proud of my sister. To me she's the best female wave rider in the world. And she's proven it as well. She became world champion. To me it's also very motivating, you know, I can see how she goes out every day, and like rides and rides and rides and progresses. It gives me something special as well. So being in this remote place in Indonesia, is just almost stepping back a 100 years in time, you know. It seems like they're more enjoying life. A simple life is a good life, I would say. Coming from the Netherlands, where everybody thinks time is money, everybody's always stressed, you have to make an appointment, and you're always just racing and you never sit still. Here you just have the time to actually think and you just wait. When it's perfect, you go out on the water... I don't know, it just frees my mind, kind of. When I was young, I was into kite boarding because of my family. My dad was into water sports. He was kiting before me. He always wanted to visit Cape Town in South Africa as he heard a lot about it through his windsurfing days. One winter, we decided to skip the cold in the UK, and we came out to Cape Town. I actually progressed so much in that winter. It was amazing. And I think that's what maybe sparked my dad's thoughts that I could continue to do well in this sport. And he is the one who gave me the opportunity to continue kiting, compete and get to the level I'm at. And I think he thought, "Right, it's time for a new chapter, a new challenge." And he never really turned back. We are kind of the first generation growing up with the sport. I was 13 when I learned to kite. And it's been really cool, to see how the sport's growing, and how different riders have established themselves within the disciplines they love. We've all taken our influences from the other board sports we watch. Kite boarding is like a massive combination of all the different board sports in one. Over the last few years, wakestyle has grown quite rapidly. There's one guy that stood out, and that's Sam Light. He brings a great style in execution, both on the rails and the kickers. I always used to enjoy going skateboarding with my buddies, and finding a rail or a stair set to jump down. And I think that's similar to how park riding is now. So, you travel the world, seeing your friends, all year round. But for some reason, at one point, everybody comes to Cape Town. I've never felt winds like there are here in Cape Town. It is out of control, and it kind of leads to ridiculously big jumps and ridiculously big kite loops. There's one event every year that challenges everybody's skills and pushes the level of kiteboarding in big air. And that is the King of the Air. The King of the Air, to me, is definitely the best event of the year. It's an event that everybody waits for. There's a 2.5 week holding period, which is way longer than almost any kite boarding event has. The real beauty in that is that, we actually are going to get the conditions that we need, to go as high as we can go. It brings the 24 best riders in the world to Big Bay, Cape Town. And that's where we show what extreme kiteboarding is all about. From the beginning of the contest, there is not one easy heat. Every single person in this contest is going in, with their eyes on the prize and one goal. Conditions off the hook, here, in Big Bay. Probably the best conditions ever, to be seen at the King of the Air competition. And the guys having to work incredibly hard out there, putting it on the line, pushing the envelope, and evolving the sport each and every time they get out on the water. It's a monster big hit. Lasse Walker calls for assistance. That's looking huge. The guy's trying to ride around for that perfect pitch to get those tricks. We were in the semi-final. I had a heat with Lewis. It started off strong, started off wild. And instantly he took a huge crash. ...as they get out there. Aerial acrobats. Warriors of the air. Oh, my word. Massive crash. Can we have you out there, please? The flag is up. The next heat has been put on hold. When I saw Lewis go down, that hit me really deep. Seeing that in the water, seeing a friend who I just had a conversation with on the beach, unconscious, face down in the water, was intense. He was gone. He was not there. It left all of us in a really weird space. You just kind of sit there and realize what just happened. Sometimes you can take an injury and you will come back from it. And he actually ended up spending over a week in a coma. I was not in the same headspace as I was before. It was much more intense after I saw Lewis' crash. After seeing Lewis down and out in the semi-final, I knew that I had to go out into the final positively, to bring his style and his energy with me. The final heat of the day. The 17th heat. It is the final, coming your way. And that's it for the final of the 2016 Red Bull King of the Air. Ladies and gentlemen, your back-to-back winner 2015, 2016, from the UK, give it up for Aaron Hadlow. I've put so much of my heart and soul into King of the Air, so as soon as it finished, I was really relieved and really stoked to walk away and feeling good. But I was ready to chill. Golf ball, golf club, table... - And when you go... - Yeah, boy. Wakey, wakey, boys. Ow. Kite boarding really is a brotherhood. All the top riders know one another. We're all in this together. So, seeing Ruben come out to the trip and hang out with us for a bit was radical. We just got to hang with our best friend who's gone through a really serious time. But that has never stopped him from having a great time, and enjoying every moment of life. I'm slowly getting all my energy back and it feels great just being together, that's what it's all about. I just couldn't wait to fly a kite and step back on my board. For me to come back to the water is something special, but to have everybody out there and really have the loved ones around was definitely a dream. I've been out of the game for six months now. I'm nowhere near riding as extreme and hard as before. But for now I'm just really enjoying trying new things and jumping on the surfboard for the first time in my life, actually. Let me tell you this. Subtitles by explosiveskull
