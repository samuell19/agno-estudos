[THEME PLAYING] [ENGINE RUMBLING] You know something? You do it. If you're so smart, you do it. You want to go in? You want to take the gun? No. You do it. DRIVER: I don't want to do it. Have fun. Give me the money. Give me the fucking money! [CHECKER GASPING] Hurry up! I don't have all goddamn day, sweetheart. Hurry up! [GASPING] [FABRIC TEARING] DRIVER: Oh, shit. Is that it? Hey, you're a cutie, aren't you? Yeah, you are. You're cute. Let me see that. Let me see what you got. [RIPPING] [GRUNTING] [HONKING] DRIVER: Come on. Oh. Come on. You want to come with me? Sure you do. Let's go. [GUNSHOT] [GIRL SCREAMING] Oh, goddamn it! Stupid! Forget her. Let's get the hell out of here. [TIRES SQUEALING] (CRYING) I'm sorry. No. DRIVER: How much did you get? THIEF: I don't know-- $300, $400. $300? $300, $400? You got to shoot somebody for it? THIEF: Ah damn it. It-- it's a cop. - Huh? - Son of a bitch. What? It's not my fucking fault, OK? Why didn't you stop the guy from coming in, huh? That's what you're supposed to do. DRIVER: Dick, did you have to fool around with her? [SIRENS BLARING] Look! There's the cop. Oh, Jesus Christ. [TIRES SCREECHING] THIEF: Back off. Now! I'm going! Go! [CRASHING] [CHEERING AND LAUGHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) I know that I love you. [SPEAKING JAPANESE] DRIVER: Hey, man, check the tire. I think something's pulling on the tire. THIEF: Pull over and let me take a look at it. [KILLING ENGINE] It's flat. There's about four tires in the back you could choose from. Sometimes I don't like you. Thanks. (SINGING) I know you understand. How you doing over there, sporto? Hey! Hey! What? Hijack time. (SINGING) --show you. RIO: Oi, Sakura. [TIRES SCREECHING] Sakura! Sakura! It is nice to meet you. I hope you folks are having a real nice trip. What do you want? Money? No. I think we want your nice, shiny car. [LAUGHING] - Yeah, don't worry. There's a bus stop 20, 30 miles down the road. [LAUGHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [BUS REVVING] HIROKO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE] Ah. [SPEAKING JAPANESE] [SPEAKING JAPANESE] [CAMERA CLICKING] [JAPANESE] [JAPANESE] [CAMERA CLICKING] [SPEAKING JAPANESE] WOMAN: First of all, we demand you suspend the business license of any establishment where drug deals take place and crack down on public facilities. Especially the park. Excuse me? Oh, you know that park is a haven for drug dealers. Please, lady, watch what you say, huh? You don't want to slur the department's reputation, do you? - Oh! If you care so much about your reputation, why don't you do a better job of controlling the sale of drugs in this city? Look, we know what needs to be done, OK? And we don't need a bunch of busybodies-- - Oh! - --sticking their noses in. Did you hear what he said? Uh, what Sergeant Largent means, ladies, is that we always welcome input from the public, at all times. I'm Chief Tom Bradfield. Oh. How interesting. Let's have this distributed amongst the narco squad, Sergeant. Sure thing, Chief. Now, may I join you for-- [PHONE RINGING] Oh, excuse me just a moment. Bradfield here. RIO: That old tome? It's me. Remember me? Rio? Is that you? Boston is great, except for one big guy. TOM (ON PHONE): You mean you are here in Boston, and you didn't even call me? Well, you better get over here, or I'll put out an APB and have you busted. [WOMEN CLEARING THROATS] RIO (ON PHONE): I will see you this afternoon. Uh, I've got to go. I've got three witches here, and they're going to burn me alive. [SPEAKING JAPANESE] What did you say, you rotten son of a bitch? [WOMEN GASPING] Thank you. You better hope you're not in the same cell with me, dude. You're a dead man. You're the one that's going to be hurting, dude. - I don't think so! - Yeah! That's right! - Hey, hey, hey! Listen, guys, guys. Now, listen. I gotta take the cuffs off-- - I'll kick your ass, man. - --so I can print you. Ha ha! I'll kill you. - Now, listen. - Yeah? Come on! - Listen. When you were little-- - I hated my mother, man. Yeah? I did your mother, man! I don't think so! I don't know what the hell you're talking about, man. - Come on! - Hey, how about it? You guys can't-- you can't do that. [LAUGHING] Hey, you can't do that! [THUDDING] What the hell do you think you're doing? Give it up! Could you direct me to Tom's office? Tom? Who's Tom? Chief Tom Bradfield. Yeah. Chief's office is upstairs. Hey. Thank you. You just kick him. [GRUNTING] [OFFICER PANTING] RIO: Oh. Hello, Tom. Rio. Rio, Rio, Rio, Rio. [LAUGHING] - How are you? I'm fine. They telephoned me from downstairs. They said to watch out for a Japanese Yakuza. If I were a Yakuza, you'd be mafia. [LAUGHING] - Come in. Come in. Come in, come in. Go ahead. Right that way. Come in. Thank you. In, in. I've waited a long time for this. Over here. Ha ha. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. - Me? - Uh-huh. Here? Right down there. OK. How do you like sitting in my chair? Great. Good. You can have it because I'm only going to be sitting at it for another six months. What do you mean, Tom? It means I'm pulling the pin. I am going to get out of the loop. I see. You are old soul reaching retirement. That's correct. I want to show you something. When I retire, I'm going to motor around the tip of Florida in one of those babies. Wonderful. I envy you. Ha ha ha. Just pray that I can reach retirement without some big case screwing me up. Say cheese. Nice day for a ballgame, huh? Well, looks like it's going to rain. Yeah, well, next time, I'm taking a cab. How you doing, Bartaby, my friend? How are you doing, pal? Present for you, friend. Have a good time. [CAMERA CLICKING] RIO: Tom. The Whitlow case. [CHUCKLING] TOM: He was quite a big shot, wasn't he? I never expected to bag him in Japan. I owe this guy. For what? If it hadn't been for this case, I would never have met you. (CHUCKLING) Oh. Then we drink to him. Kampai. Kampai. It's so damn good to see you, Rio. Good to see you, too. Oh, how about dinner tonight? Absolutely. You bring Hiroko and Sakura to my house, and we'll have a big party. [CAMERA CLICKING] [CAMERA WHIRRING] [FOREBODING MUSIC PLAYING] [TIRES SQUEALING] [SCREECHING] Give me the camera. Give me the fucking camera! [SAKURA SHRIEKING] Don't waste her, man. Don't waste her! Don't waste her! [GUNSHOT] [CLANGING] Jesus Christ. Let's get the hell out of here! [TIRES SCREECHING] Rio, stop! OFFICER: When we got there, we found the victim lying on the pavement. That's all. TOM: Who reported it? OFFICER: Anonymous tip. Nobody wants to get involved. Were there any witnesses? No, sir. That's impossible. Sorry, sir. What about my daughter? They were together. Like I said, sir, it was just the victim at the scene. - That's crazy! - All right. All right. Calm down, Rio. We'll find Sakura. Don't you worry. We'll find her. I'm sorry. [FANS HUMMING] [MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING] [FOOTSTEPS] Rio, I'm so sorry. [SEAGULLS CALLING] We were married 30 years. This our first trip outside Japan. I killed her. Rio, don't. Oh, god, Tom. [CONVERSATIONS IN DISTANCE] Is that Sakura's? Yeah. I'm afraid we have to assume that she was kidnapped by the suspects. - Is that all you found? - Yes, sir. Is there something missing? Yeah. The camera. What kind of a camera? It's Konica-- pocket camera, made in Japan. Check the local pawn shops in that area. And give this to the lab. I want it developed. Yes, sir. RIO: Oh, my daughter. Thank you. I heard what happened. Yeah. I don't know what to say except I'm sorry it happened. Any clues yet? Well, we're doing everything that we can. I see. Of course. [MUSIC PLAYING] [LIGHTER STRIKING] Uh, Inspector Yuki? Inspector Yuki? The chief thought you might do-- I mean, thought you might need something. Hey, hey! Inspector Yuki! Wait. Where are you going? Uh, Inspector Yuki? Uh, Inspector Yuki! Why? Why what, sir? Why was my wife killed? Well, I hate to say it but maybe for as little as that camera. Camera? Who would shoot someone just for camera? Hey, in America these days, you can get killed for a pack of cigarettes. Hey, Mr. Menza. Yeah, what's up, Frank? Oh, I sure hope Mr. Foley can do something to help our senior citizens out, Mr. Menza. It's tough on old people these days. Look, you just make sure that you and your old friends vote for him as mayor. Then he'll do something. I love it. Beth. Hey, Lenny, where's the old man? Oh, Danny, boy! Catch. Larry. Got a second? What's up? How are the kids? - Good, good. - OK. - You? - Fine, fine. Listen, Danny, I want you to watch out for those old bitches from the women's organization. They're distributing that drug strategy booklet to all the city officers. Look, I got news for you. They've already been here. [GROANING] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, don't worry about it, all right? The old man's keeping a low profile until he retires. He won't do a thing. True? Trust me. Ah, Danny, I love you. Hey, find a home for this, will you? Sure. LARRY: (SINGING) Oh, Danny boy, the pipes are playing. All hail to the chief. When you want to see me, you make an appointment with my receptionist. Hey, I only talk to secretaries when I need a little, uh, stress reduction in my private office. I got something for you. What's this? Well, an invitation to Foley's campaign party next week. Be there or be square. Campaign for what? You haven't heard? Mr. Foley is going to be our next mayor. You would be wise not to underestimate Mr. Foley. I have something for you. You give this to Mr. Foley, that esteemed member of our city council. What's this all about, Bradfield? Oh, I suggest you read that very carefully. Yeah, well, I have a little suggestion for you. You have six long months before you can collect that ill-deserved pension of yours. Now, I suggest that you be a little more courteous. Remember, Thomas, courtesy pays. [MURMURING] CHARLIE: Cindy! Jeez. What, do you serve the good guys last around here? I'm going to get gray hair before you serve us any coffee. Any news in the investigation? Yeah. According to the lab, the gun used was modified. Modified? Yeah. That's a felony good for 20 years. If the gun's used in a homicide, it carries the death sentence. So? So our killer's probably a gun nut. How many gun nuts are there? There were five homicides last night alone. You mean a foreigner death comes last? You've got Chief Bradfield on your side. All right. Now, look. Three of them turned gray already. Ow! Special service. Jeez. [BEEPING] Oh, I just got paged by headquarters. Hey something wrong? You look like you're on your way to a funeral or something. Oh, I just came from one. Oh. Excuse me. A guy just brought your wife's Konica camera into a pawnshop. He has it? No. He got scared and left the shop with the camera. That doesn't help us. Well, maybe it does. The owner of the pawnshop recognized the guy. He's an ex-con by the name of Clyde Jones. Where is he? Well, he hangs out at a place just down the street. Hey, wait! Cindy. To the right! To the right! To the right! Yeah! OK. In here. Wait. Wait. All right, look. Maybe we should call for backup. What for? Well, you never know, especially in this neighborhood. I will wait there. [CLACKING] Police officer. You're wanted in connection with a murder investigation. What's that in your pocket, huh? Is that a camera? Where'd you get that camera? [THUDDING] Oh! Goddamn it. Look out! [GRUNTING] [MUSIC PLAYING] That's our man! Coming through! [SHOUTING] Sorry! MAN: Hey, watch out! Police officer. Watch it! Police! Coming through! Excuse me. Police officer. Oh. Oh! [GRUNTING] Where is my daughter? I don't know. I swear I don't know. Where's-- [GUNSHOT] CHARLIE: Sorry. Don't shoot me! Hold it. Hey, that's Sakura's camera. Where did you get this camera? I swear I don't know. I just found it. Answer. I don't know. You shot my wife. No, no. I didn't. I didn't. I had nothing to do with it. I-- I found the camera. I just picked it up. I swear. I swear. - Where? In-- in-- in the burned up factory in Charlestown. I'm telling the truth! Inspector, give me the gun. I can't let you interrogate the suspect. [GRUNTING] - Come on. Don't move. Let's go. What? Rio stole your gun? He surprised me. I-- I guess he just flipped out, Chief. TOM (ON PHONE): Do you have any idea where he was headed? Well, I think he went to the abandoned factory in Charlestown. TOM (ON PHONE): Charlestown? All right. Charlestown. Tom, is something wrong, darling? Yes, and I'd better find Rio before he really gets into trouble. Sorry, dear. [KISSING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTING] SUSPECT: I don't know. It was somewhere around here. I don't know. [GRUNTING] Jeez. [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMING] Hey, let's go. SUSPECT: (WHISPERING) Oh, shit. Come on. [SCREAMING] WOMAN: No! No! [MEN GRUNTING] Hey, man, this kind of stuff happens all the time! Shut up. SUSPECT: I don't want any problems with the bad dudes around here! RIO: Shut up. Come on. Come on. WOMAN: No! No! [SCREAMING] No! Your buddies? No. I don't know them. I just found the camera here. - Come on. - Come on! Come on. Please, let me go. [GRUNTING] [YELLING] RIO: Go. [GRUNTING] WOMAN: No! No! No! No! [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOT] [GRUNTING] RIO: Don't move. [GRUNTING] [CRYING] [BOTTLES CLANGING] Take those cuffs off. Well, they said the one guy's going to be in the hospital for a month. And the guy you shot in the knee is going to be a cripple for life. Do you understand what you did, Rio? You can be indicted for attempted murder, for assault with a deadly weapon. Are you trying to get my pension taken away from me? Are you trying to ruin Hanna and my retirement? After all, Hanna waited 30 years for this, just like Hiroko. My wife is dead. My daughter has been kidnapped. I know, my friend. And I deeply sympathize with you. But I can't let you take the law into your own hands. I don't need your sympathy. I want my daughter back. You have to stay out of it. Now, the official word is that Charlie did it with his own gun. All I want you to do is leave this in my hands and go back to the hotel, please, my friend. OK, Tom. But wait. They stole the camera and took out the film. Isn't it strange? Check this, please. Please, Tom. All right, my friend. All right, I will. LAB TECHNICIAN: No prints could be saved from the roll of film he found. TOM: Yeah. All right. Show him what you've got. All right. Here are the prints from the belongings. I enlarged this one because it seems peculiar here. Who are these men? Some kind of exchange? TOM: Yeah, it could be, I guess. Any idea where this was taken? LAB TECHNICIAN: Looks like a park near Charles River, maybe Boston Park. Boston Park? What is it? Uh, it's nothing. Rio, stop. I will save my daughter myself. Rio, I can't let you. Don't worry. I won't cause you any trouble. And I won't mess up your pension. Stop Rio. That's right. If he resists, throw him in a cell. RIO: Tom! OFFICER: Knock it off. RIO: Come on. Stop! OFFICER: Come on. Come on. RIO: Hey! Tom! OFFICER: Knock it off. [GRUNTING] RIO: Tom! Come on, Tom! Get the chief! I want to see Tom Bradfield! Hey! Hey, come on, Tom! (WHISPERING) Yes. Yes. [MUSIC PLAYING] Yeah. Yes! [SEAGULLS CALLING] MAN: Oh, goddamnit! Oh! Open this up. Something wrong? This is not Sakura. [EXHALING] Thank god she's still alive. Yeah. She's alive. [ENGINE STARTING] [SIRENS BLARING] TOM: There's something I must tell you. The suspects are part of a major drug operation in this city. What? Boston Park is overrun with drug dealers. When I saw that enlargement in my office, I realized that Hiroko had accidentally photographed a very influential man involved in a drug deal going down. What are you telling me? I think what I'm telling you is that I'm not going to be able to be much help to you. That influential man that she photographed happens to be the right arm of the most powerful man in this city. He is so powerful that some of my own cops are in on it-- cops that were here before I took over. Now, if I start poking around, I may be forced to retire. I lose everything. But I haven't helped you one bit. Let me do it. Hm-mm. I knew you would say that. But I can't officially ask you to do that. I see. Just tell me who they are. All right. His name is Joe Foley. He's on the city council. Everything that you need to know about him and his organization is in that envelope. - Joe Foley. All right. I'll take it from here. Thank you for telling me. There's one thing more. These men are very, very dangerous. I'm no longer afraid of anything except for my daughter. Many thanks, Tom. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CLAPPING] And I will. All the promises I have made are true. I'll not go back on any of them. Read my lips. [CLAPPING CONTINUES] Thank you very much-- very much. [ENGINE STARTING] [MUSIC PLAYING] LARRY: Mr. Foley, welcome, sir. JOE: Thank you. The honorable Thomas Bradfield is being an asshole, sir. Well, we'll just have to straighten him out, won't we? Thank you. You trying to pull something, Tom? I mean, if you got something you want to say to me, speak up. Go on. Say it. I don't know what you're talking about, Foley. Think hard before you try to blackmail me. After all, Chief, some members of your narcotics squad are, shall we say, associated with us. You wouldn't want that publicized, would you? I guess not. LARRY: No, I guess not. Then we can expect you at the campaign party next week? I might-- might sell you my own yacht at a very low price. Ow. I don't want your fucking boat, Foley. You will pay for that, Tom. It's not a threat. It's a promise. [DOOR SLAMMING] [GRUNTING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC INTENSIFYING] [PHONE RINGING] Hello? TOM (ON PHONE): Hi. It's me. What's the matter, darling? You sound strange. Well, as a matter of fact-- HANNA (ON PHONE): You know, I was just looking at these brochures on Europe. They really look good. Wouldn't you rather go there instead of buying some silly old boat? Hanna, we may have to forget about the boat. Uh, we may have to forget about Europe, too. I-- I just wanted you to be prepared for that. This has something to do with Rio, doesn't it, Tom? Honey, just be prepared. HANNA (ON PHONE): Tom, please, be careful. Yeah. [KNOCKING] What did you do to Mr. Foley? He's as mad as hell. He says he's going to sue the shit out of you. You're through, Largent. What was that, Chief? Get me Internal Affairs. This is Chief Bradfield. I want the entire narcotics squad suspended. The charges? Suspicion of drug trafficking. Yes, that's right. Yes! I want a full-blown investigation. You're crazy, Chief. You know what's going to happen to you if you do that? Get your ass out of here. You're due to retire in six months, Chief. Don't blow it. You make me sick! You're through. Yes, sir. [ENGINE STARTING] [ENGINE STARTING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] Thank you, John. Dear. I don't think we need you any further, John. [SUGGESTIVE MUSIC PLAYING] Mama. Well, what might we have here-- a late-night visitor? I here to present, um, insurance company. [LAUGHING] That's very original. Come on. You know, I hope you carry a lot of insurance because it's time for you to say good night. [GRUNTING] (WHISPERING) Hi, Inspector. Charlie, how? Well, when I saw you hiding from me in your car in front of headquarters, I figured you had a good reason, so I didn't bother you. But I did tail you. OK. Give it up. [GRUNTING] [CHUCKLING] Surprise, surprise, huh? Come here. [SHRIEKING] JOE: Hey, what-- what are you doing? [GRUNTING] [SHRIEKING] [THUMPING] Who is your boss? What are you talking about, boss? Head of your organization. JOE: I-- Answer me. JOE: I don't know. I don't know. Charlie, take a picture. Hey-- hey, what are you doing? Don't do that. What are you doing? Stop. Stop. Get away from me. Get away. My wife was killed, my daughter kidnapped, for only one picture. Now, I have many pictures-- pictures to ruin your life. What-- your wife, your daughter, kidnapping? What? What? What? I didn't do it. I-- I-- what the heck? I had nothing to do with it. RIO: Come here. No. No. [CRASHING] No. No! No! I didn't know anything about it. I don't know anything about it. What do you mean you don't know anything about it? I just did what Foley told me to do. I just picked up some coke. That's all. - In the park, right? - Yeah. Yeah. And I got the stuff from the dealer. And two women were taking a picture, you know? [GROANING] Where's the dealer? (CRYING) I don't know. I don't know. Call up your dealer now. Call. One condition. You give me that film. RIO: I said call. All right. All right. All right. [BEEPING] It-- it-- it-- it-- it's a beeper. [BEEPING] He's got to call me back, OK? [COUGHING] [CHUCKLING] You know why I got on the stuff? Same reason I wanted to be mayor. Wasn't satisfied with being city councilman. (WHISPERING) I had to be mayor. Same thing with alcohol. It didn't satisfy me. So I tried coke. I liked it. [LAUGHING] I think I'm going to like to be mayor, too, huh? I'm gonna get it, you know? You can't fucking stop me. Yeah, this is Charlie. Do you copy? Yeah, I copy. [MUSIC PLAYING] CHARLIE (OVER RADIO): There's a guy on a park bench. What's he doing? CHARLIE (OVER RADIO): He's reading a newspaper. I see. So, uh, we getting rained out today? Sure does look like it. Yeah. By the way, you seen any more broads with cameras there? That's very funny, Bart-- great sense of humor. - Jesus Christ. - What? What? What the hell happened to your face? Nothing. I had a little fender bender at start-- nothing. You snitched on me, didn't you, you bastard? No, man, I didn't. No, Bart, look, it was Foley, man!

Oh, man. Oh, great. That's why I say don't do it. Why do things always turn out the way you want them to? [SCREECHING] [CLANGING] I hope you know what you're doing.

This is my business-- nothing to do with you. But I'm still a cop. Sorry, Charlie. I have to do this alone. Hurry up. [TRUCK ROARING] [HONKING] TRUCK DRIVER: You son of a-- Get out. Open the door. Hurry up! [JACKIE HOWLING] Quit crying. Come on. Get in there. Let's go. He's crazy, Roy. Watch out. He already wasted three guys. Don't worry about it. What's one Jap gonna do out here?

[MUSIC PLAYING] Thank you, Charlie. You are great hero. I'm no hero, Rio. The Chief's really the one who laid it on the line. He threw half the narc squad into jail. I should have done it a long time ago. You're a damn fool, Tom. Then that makes two of us. Charlie, please take care of your boss. No problem, Rio. Thank you again. Thank you, Tom. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC - "I WAS NEVER STRONGER"] (SINGING) I was never stronger than the time I spent with you. I've learned about myself things I never knew in the time I've spent with you. You'll never know about the pain, the pain you helped me through, waiting for a flame to pull me to in the time I've spent with you. It's all right now. Baby, it's all right now. It's all right. I can make it on my own. It's all right, knowing that I'm not alone. I was never stronger than the time I've spent with you. I don't know what you gave me, but you made me come alive. You touched a chord I'd buried deep inside. You showed me how to see myself and value what I do. You taught me not to be afraid to love in the time I've spent with you. It's all right now.
