Why? - Maybe we shouldn't. - But I thought... Just don't ever tell anyone, all right? I won't. Go ahead and laugh. Everything will change and many lives will be affected. And what would the Japanese use in their warfare? Their toy airplanes? Is that what they're going to use to combat the cannons, warships, and fighter jets of the American troops? Goodness gracious! The Japanese aren't pushovers, Pascual. They are traitors. Just look at what they did to Pearl Harbor. Perhaps they are traitors. But they are very good gardeners. Inez is planning to have roses and begonias planted in the garden beside the well. Hirota is a really good gardener. That is, if you still have a garden or a well or servants. You can't be too sure who among us has real problems, Pascual. No. I don't like. What do you say? Me too. Of course, yes! - Like those who came from Manila. - When are you going to Manila? I know. I was counting on him to be my partner in the... Look, there's Minggoy. There's Arturo too! What's wrong with that? - I myself will fight. - Do you want to join them? - Every young man gets into battle. - No. And Concepcion's already here! - Emilio! - Hey! Bobby, Ramon, you both know Emilio, don't you? Emilio, right? Are you going to continue your studies in Manila, Naty? Yes. - When are you leaving? - In May. - Where are you going to stay in Manila? - At my Tio Joaquin's. How will you... You naughty children! Go! Don't play here! I didn't give my consent. How ridiculous! It would be foolish to send him to Manila to take part in those military games. Inday, it would be good for Miguel to join the military. The exercise will benefit him. Besides, all the young men here are enlisting in the army. Miguel is sickly, isn't that right, Asuncion? That's enough. My son is often in the hospital because of his asthma. That's the idea! All the more you should encourage Miguel to enlist. A little sweat could improve his asthma. Hey. Remember my brother Felipe? He just went home to deposit his belongings. And after that he'll return to Manila to go into battle. Why aren't you dancing? I don't want to exhaust myself. I'm going to Manila to fight the war. I'm lucky my children are both girls. You know, Inday, I'm sure that if Andring were still alive, he'd be the first to enlist Miguel. It's not good for boys to be too sheltered. Look what happened to Grandma Desta's adopted grandson. I heard that Emilio has become a homosexual. Hey! - Where is Don Claudio? - He's inside. Tell him it's Carlos Placido. Are you looking for... No, no, no. Emilio, call him. Right this instant. Yes, Grandma. Oh! This idiot! Miguel! Wow! So Miguel's already drinking alcohol. Aunt Inday might hear you. Miguel... that's one or two weeks of war. It'll be quite a vacation. - Your loss. - Why don't you join us? It won't sit well with Trining that you're the only young man who hasn't killed a single Japanese. - Well, you and... Emilio! - Emilio! Let's look at the property of Samuel Artiaga. - Don Minggoy, his lands are worthless. - True. Maybe that's why he's selling it at such a low price. It may be worthless for sugar cane, but it could be good for rice, right? Rice? Can we plant rice in our soil? Do not deride our soil. Anything can be grown on this island. If you will only listen to what Minggoy here is saying, you could learn a thing or two. What's the idea Uncle Claudio? Are you still thinking of uniting our island? Really, until now? Don Claudio, at this time in our lives, ideas on separatism are no longer funny. Why, Pascual? Who's trying to be funny? What is it? Carlos Placido's looking for you. Where is he? He's waiting outside. Sirs, with your permission, Monsignor. Perhaps you'd like to dance the paso doble. Very well, gentlemen, let's show them how it's supposed to be danced. Come on, Minggoy. Who is Carlos Placido? He's Don Claudio's accountant. Carlos Placido. Accountant of Don Claudio. Not just his accountant, his right-hand man too. Desta. All right, then. Good evening, Don Claudio. Carlos, let's go downstairs. It's too noisy up here. Wait! Over there. Careful. I said careful. It's Sister Carmen! Come on, Sister Carmen, let's dance! Let's dance! Very good! Give me a minute! Hey, why are you here? Where's Miguel? You left him outside, all by himself? You two had a fight, didn't you? Why? He forced me. - Forced you? - To kiss him. Do you really have to laugh? So that's it? Why, Maggie? Do you let Ramon kiss you? Miguel forced me, you know. It's only natural. He's a man. You better get used to it. That's why you shouldn't leave Miguel all by himself. He might kiss just any girl. You know, earlier, I saw Naty staring at Miguel like she wanted him for herself. What are you two doing in here? You should be entertaining the guests. Let's go Margarita, Trinidad. That is my decision. Do the other members know? Leave it to me to explain things to them. Besides, if my perception of the war is accurate, you will all need my money more than ever. We need to buy weapons. It's dangerous to presume that the Japanese will never get here. I've already talked to someone who can sell us firearms and ammunition, sir. And food. Pardon, sir? Food. Where will you get decent food in the mountains? Alright. - Where is that old man? - Nena, Nena, I'll take care of it. Stop playing for a moment. I have an announcement to make. A moment of your time please! Ten seconds before twelve o'clock. Ten seconds. Eight, seven, six. Six, five, four, three, two, one! Maestro! Play! We might use the Hacienda Progreso as our headquarters. It's near the mountain where we can all hide. Thank you very much, Don Claudio. And have you talked to Enyong Gonzales? - Happy birthday Maggie! - Thank you, uncle! To us. For the Philippines. Nena! Nena! Why? What happened? Corregidor! The ship Rafael boarded... - Let's go to the room, Inez. - It sank! It hit a mine at dawn this morning. - Come on. - Rafael! My children are on that ship! - Hey, Vicky! - What?! Corregidor?! -No, I heard that a ship -Vicky! - in Corregidor sunk. - What?! Oh no, my son! Corregidor! Corregidor! What's happening? Call the governor. Hey, call the governor. Call the governor. How could I go home? There's no available telephone! I thought you're going to send one! Hello? Olivia, send a car here! Hurry! Where are you going?! Don't stop. Keep playing! "My beloved friend Nena... it's been a while since we last heard from each other. The last time we were together was at the ball for your eldest daughter Maggie. It was a merry celebration until the news about the sinking of the ship at Corregidor broke. Nena, many of our friends and their relatives died in that tragic accident. But I thank God that no one in our family perished. But with each passing day the news about the worsening events of the war sends me chills. That's why I thought of writing to you, Nena. I received word that the Japanese are getting close to our island. I am certain that they will first occupy the city. It would be perilous for Don Claudio, your daughters, and for you to remain there. I urge you to leave the city while there's still time. I am opening the door of my home to you and your family. It will give me peace of mind to have you all stay here at our plantation until the war is over. I trust that all this inconvenience will be over in a few weeks. Miguel and I will wait for your arrival. Hugs and lots of love from your dear friend, Inday." Careful. Careful! Go. Mom? Okay, then. Come on! Why don't you go with them? I'll just join them later, Mama. - Nena! - Inday! - How was the trip? - It was all right. You and Uncle Claudio seem tired. I'm old, not handicapped. Where are the children? Oh, Nena. At least I have peace of mind now, knowing that you're all away from danger. I heard the Japanese are approaching our island. I'm sure they will occupy the city first. They say the war will be over soon. That's also what Ramon said. You have to bear with Maggie, by the way. She hasn't been herself lately because Ramon hasn't written to her in almost two months. I warned them! Those idiots! They said the war would only last for two weeks. You see what I mean? Yes, Papa. Yes. How many times have you told us that? No one believes me! No one! They refused to listen to me. Idiots! Do we have to go over that again, Papa? We just got here. You're at it again. Since my brother died, I don't have anyone I can play with. How old was your brother when he died? I think he was 12. Wait. Right, he was 12. No, Trining, you might fall! Trining! Mama's calling for you two! Come on. Ouch! Wait! Since Peping's death, no one bothered to manage the estate. It's a lot of work, Nena. And it'll cost a lot too. It will only give me a headache. It's a good thing we have Melchor here with us. - Who's Melchor? - He's our foreman. We were actually told by many friends that it isn't a good idea to hire Filipinos as foremen because they cannot be trusted. The foreman at the estate next to ours is Russian, Trining! Russians! Communists! They're no different! I don't trust Russians either! But Melchor is a good man, and hard-working. And after Peping passed away, he took charge of the entire plantation. The workers fear him. Oh, beef tripe. I don't care for innards, auntie. My goodness, Estrella! What did you cook? Why, Señora? Why did you cook callos today, Estrella? I'm sorry, Nena. I'll have them cook something else. Don't bother, Inday. But look. How can the children eat this? This isn't good cooking. It's not well-cooked. It lacks olive oil! You said it yourself. In times like this we all need to toughen up. We cannot indulge in our caprices like we used to. We should eat whatever food is set before us. There's a war going on. Times are hard. We should be thankful we still have food on the table. Together holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace, our Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. My god! Hurry up, Miguelito! The fruit might rot because you're taking too long! Why are you coming down? You haven't gotten a single fruit! Were you hurt? Here's the santol that you want, Trining. Never mind. The ripe ones from the tree taste better. Don't mind my sister, Miguel. She's going out of her mind. There! The bigger one! Don't stop until you've eaten all of that! Let's go, Trining. I don't want to go with a wimp! Wait! What about the fruit?! I was just joking! Good day to you, Señorita Trinidad. Where is Don Claudio? Can you take us to where your grandfather is? You should just bring Uncle Claudio's food to his room. I am not fond of Carlos Placido at all. I don't care if he's Papa's right-hand man. Why did he have to follow us here? Excuse me, Nena... can you prepare another place at the table? Estrella, get another plate. What's the meaning of this, Papa? Silence, Nena! Mind your own business. Excuse me. I have a headache. Corregidor has surrendered. The Americans have surrendered to the Japanese. Nanny... nanny... I was mad at him. I thought he had forgotten to write. Now I learn that he could've been dead all along. Ramon could be dead. There, there. Hush, my dear girl. Little one, little one, go to sleep now Your mom's not around Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace, our Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Look, women! Run! They could be bad men. Totoy, come here. - Women! - A lot of them! So many of them! Oh, gosh! Watch out, woman! I'm coming! I will bite you! I will grab you! I'll get my hands on you! I will grab you! It's Pidol! It's Tibo! Hey, Tibo, Papa is looking for you! It's Pidol! Tibo! Tibo! When did you get back? Papa's looking for you! - Where's that carabao? - Here. Wait! Papa is looking for you, you know. Introduce us to your sister. Come, quickly! Come. It looks like yours. Come here! Tibo. Tibo, come. Hey, we have to go! They've been waiting for us at home! Just a minute more. You're so annoying, Nanny. Your grandfather will take it out on me. But Grandpa won't know about it. If you want, you can go ahead. Oh dear! These stubborn girls! Fine, do whatever you want! I'll go ahead then. It's Ramon again, isn't it? Don't pester me. You're just torturing yourself. For all we know, Ramon could be on his way home. You're just wasting your tears. And if he's dead... I know that Ramon is alive. I'm going home now. Do whatever you want. See? Then what's your problem? Such lovely ladies. Such a beautiful sight, after a long, exhausting stay in the forest. Let's chat a little, please. Your beauty uplifts the soul. Look, my dears, I brought you a lot of guavas! Look! And here's more! There! Who's that rascal? What are you doing? You ogre! Get away from here! So scary! I will kill you! Go away! Ogre! Go away! Go! Go away! Damn it! What were you thinking? Why were you wandering around? See what happened? If your Nanny Tating hadn't come back for you, you two could have gotten into trouble! You're like children! You can't understand simple instructions! How many times do I have to tell you that you shouldn't wander off from the house?! How many times did I warn you girls against doing so? Margarita?! Wonderful! - Hurry. Be careful. - Just a moment. - That goes there too. - Excuse me, Melchor. - Melchor, a moment, please. - All right, go on. Quickly! Melchor, turn the generator on. I'm sure my friends are very tired. - Hurry up. - Just wait a little longer, Señora. We're on it. - Have you eaten? - It's all right, Inday. How awful, Inday! Why didn't you tell me that the ride to your estate would be so difficult?! My goodness! The roads were terrible! And so was your driver, Inday. He thinks he's driving an airplane! - Don't worry. I'll scold the driver. - You should, Inday! You should! It would have been fine if he was the only one who'd get killed. But what if Miguelito gets harmed?! By the way, where's Miguelito? Miguelito! He's upstairs. And Nena's here too. Nena? Nena Ojeda. Nena? Nena. Andring's widow? - Andring Ojeda! Claudio's only son? - Yes. How splendid! Jo, we have a mahjong quorum! Wonderful! I'm glad the power's back. Make sure you fire your driver, Inday! Oh, it was too much! He was so rude! What a tragedy. And that was the reason why Wainright ordered the Filipino and American soldiers to surrender. But you know what? Holy mother! The others refused to do so. What do you mean? They refused to surrender! And those men formed a guerilla force. And would you believe, that local plantation owners are the ones that provide funds for the firearms of those guerillas?! I get goosebumps at the thought of it! And here's more, some of them ended up killing each other. I also heard that some of those bastards pass themselves off as guerillas in order to loot valuable items and food from different estates. What? The Japanese? No! It was the outlaws! Do you know the Hernandezes? Remember Guillermo Hernandez whose wife likes rubies and amethysts? Oh, they were attacked by the bandits! Holy mother of God! According to my source, and don't ask me who my source is because I can't tell you. The bandits burned their house down and killed the eldest child. And to think he was a cripple! Imagine murdering a disabled person in cold blood! And worse, their daughter Nieves was raped and they took her away with them. I heard that Guillermo's wife went crazy. How terrible! A lot of people are saying that those bandits are becoming more powerful. Oh, I'm telling you. The Japanese are not our only enemies. Even our fellow Filipinos have become our enemies too. Well, what can you expect from uneducated people? They are not learned and well-mannered. What can we do? We should be cautious. We shouldn't trust those laborers! They are all traitors! All of them! What is it, Maggie? I wanted to be alone. - I'll just leave. - Don't, Maggie! I think I'm disturbing you. No. Don't leave. You know, I also come here when I want to be alone. Come, look at this. It's beautiful. Wait, I have something to show you. Wait, I'll just make sure I have a good view of it. There. You can look now. - That's Pegasus. - Pegasus? Pegasus. It's the name of a constellation. According to Greek mythology, Pegasus is... - Yes, I know that. - The horse with wings. The... Maggie? It's nothing. I can see the stars like they're so close but I can't see Corregidor at all. What is it Maggie? Isn't it strange? We can look at stars with a telescope. Meanwhile, those that are just here on earth... like Ramon... I don't even know if he's dead or alive. Ramon is alive. How do you know? I just do. I know Ramon is alive. I can feel that he's still alive. So please don't cry. Ramon will only be sad if he finds out that you're in pain. Maybe Tom was brought to Ust like the others. They say that's where the Americans who got caught are detained. It's bad timing you came to Manila. But it's good you didn't stay there. - You could've gotten incarcerated too. - She's taking too long. Aren't you worried, Jo? Come to think of it, Tom is over 50 but he's still strong and healthy physically. The Japanese will fall long before they can succeed in crippling Tom. - Well, it's no one's fault but his. - Nine character. I was asking him to come along for a vacation but he insisted on staying. Hey, Viring, do you want us to bring out our needles and do some crocheting while you brainstorm your next move? Give me a minute. I'm having a difficult time with this. - Yes, you are. - Oh, it's my turn now. Fine, never mind. Eight. Over there. Bring that to the terrace. For heaven's sake! Why did you bring that inside? Don't you know that it's bad luck to keep a plant with thorns inside the house? Oh, Viring. Do you still believe in superstitions? Of course! Why should I take my chances? I always play safe. So that's why you like playing mahjong. - That's a different story. - Pong! That's why I always wear all my jewelry. It makes me feel secure. Besides, my husband is probably having the time of his life in America. In New York. While I ended up here in the province. Oh, I will really die from anxiety. All because of those bowlegged Japanese and those stupid peasants. I only feel a sense of calm when I have my jewelry on me. My precious gems! In case trouble erupts where I am, I can easily flee with my jewels. They would have to kill me first, for I will never surrender my jewels. You know, when my daughter married that loser from Tagbilaran I decided that she wouldn't get even a single stone as an inheritance. - Go on. - I mean, why would I want to give away my jewels to that race of clodhoppers! Right, Nena? Chow! - You're so lucky, Inday. - Hey, that's mine! - Look at Miguelito. - You're doing this for a while now. -He looks more and more -Seriously? like his father as he grows older. Stop now. -A chip off the old block, -Give that to me. unlike your eldest son, Teodoro the one who died. Now that one looks like you, Inday. - I'll wait for my turn, okay? - It's beautiful. Miguelito, on the other hand, looks so much like Peping! But Miguelito looks a bit like Inday too. - No! - Hey. Miguel! Have you seen a photograph of Peping when he was Miguelito's age? Oh, even back then, Peping was already a playboy! You know your eldest is lucky, Viring. I heard he took after his father. Mahjong! Four. Five. Ordinary. No ambition. Give me that! Damn, I knew it! Why did that old man order that damned cactus plant to be brought inside the house? Damn! Señora, Melchor wants to talk to you. What? Melchor wants to talk to you, Señora. Tell him to come to me. I can't leave the game table. Yes, Señora. Damn! What's that, dear? - Nothing. Just letters. - Who are you writing to? Ramon. Ramon? And where are you going to send your letter? I wonder what address your daughter is going to use to send her letter to her boyfriend, Nena. Youth these days. I said wait! Here's more. The Roman Colosseum. Look. Give that to me! - Ouch! - Selfish! - Miguel! - Stupid! - So what? - Trining... - Ouch! - Trining! Romance! How wonderful! Miguel doesn't want to give the pictures to me. - He's being selfish again. - But I let you borrow them! That's enough, Trining! Why are you scolding me when it is Miguel's fault? Go to your room. Oh. Nena, I think those two will end up together! Were you hurt, Miguelito? You're so unreasonable, Nena. Why me? You're treating the girls like prisoners. Children shouldn't be locked up inside rooms. You know what happened when I allowed them to go out. Don't be annoying. That was just once. Once is enough. Would you like it if I locked you up inside the house? Would you enjoy it? I think it's your intention to turn Margarita and Trinidad into nuns. - It's already done, Señora. - Good. Tibo is already there. He'll take care of it. All right. Is there anything else I can do for you, ma'am? Yes, Melchor, the... Nena, I'm still the children's grandfather. Their father is my son. Now, it's also my responsibility to see to it that they are raised properly. Fine, Papa. Let them go out, if you must. But someone needs to watch over them, and by that I don't mean Tating. What could Tating possibly do in the face of danger? That's reasonable. Can I volunteer as chaperone, Aunt Nena? How gallant of you, my son! But that's a dangerous task, dear. What would you do if the Japanese or the bandits attack the three of you? Thank you very much, Miguelito. Your intentions were noble. Isn't that right, Nena? You're the reason my friends mock me. All these restrictions! You're turning me into... a wimp! Viring is right. My Miguelito is looking more and more like his father as he grows older, isn't he? The Lorenzo blood is prominent in their offspring. That's exactly what I fear. - Mama... - What is it, dear? I wish I had a daughter. It isn't easy, Inday. Andring was a good husband, wasn't he? You know, Nena, I used to envy you. Andring loved you very much. As for me, I had to endure my marriage for the sake of the children. When Teodoro died, I thought it was the end for me too. If not for Miguelito, I would have killed myself. I had my share of suffering, Inday. I guess you know that. Uncle Claudio. All of them. The Ojedas, the Llamas, the Zorillas. Claudio Ojeda did not utter a single word to me for many years. Yes, I remember that. They said I didn't belong to their class. They picked someone else for Andring, the daughter of Eugenio Gonzales. But my husband was a rebel. He married the daughter of... white trash. They only decided to talk to me when Andring got sick. They said I was a good, compassionate woman after all. It's hard being a woman, Inday. You have to adjust to your husband's temperament and cater to all his needs. If you don't have jewelry, like Viring's, your beauty and body are your only weapons. You must know how to survive. It was Abcede who said that we already have a guerilla force. And he also said that all of the members must follow the regulations of the commonwealth. I don't know if this is true, but he also said that the guerillas in Panay are going to join forces with Abcede. And do you know that Abcede had all the bridges burned down and the roads barricaded when he found out that those bow-legged Japanese were moving in? That way the Japanese wouldn't be able to trace his men. And he also ordered his men to disperse. You know I always have a backup plan. I have a secret to tell you. I had a house built in the mountains. Splendid! A house on top of a tree! A house deep in the forest where the Japanese and the bandits won't ever find us. Do you remember that, Nena? Kang! A long time ago Peping's father had a house built in the heart of the mountains as a hunting lodge for him and his friends during their hunting trips. That's where I had the house built. But the place has been neglected and, as Melchor said, the trees have grown all around it. You're not joking, Inday? Is war a joke to you? Pong. If what Viring said is true, we are no longer safe here at the estate. Hail Mary, full of grace, our Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. What worries me is, you know, Nena, Miguelito told me that Maggie and Trining have been dancing in front of... Well, it was just Miguel who was there and Estrella's son, Lucio. But I wish you'd talk to your daughters about such behavior, Nena. Whose turn is it? I understand. Oh, it's my turn. Here. I'm not being a hypocrite here. I just think that they're too naïve. Trining and... Oh, please. How old is Trining, anyway? She's no longer a child, Inday. It was the Americans who brought liberalism to this country. You know, it brings tears to my eyes at times. It really makes me cry that the younger generation no longer has a moral compass. Didn't you study in America, Jo? Americans don't have a sense of morality, do they? All they have on their minds are worldly pleasures. - Is it my turn? - I was a school intern back in the day. And even now I am still grateful to the nuns who molded my character. Never did my body yearn for things of the flesh. That's probably why your husband is taking his sweet time vacationing in America. - And you, Inday? - What? You've been a widow for a long time, right? Yes. Didn't you ever feel the need to, you know? - No. - I mean, ever since Peping passed away... Look, all I'm getting are flowers. Former interns like me are really a rare breed among women. The nuns had a great influence on us. Jo, you were in America for a long time, right? So? Don't you miss your American husband? Why should I, when he's just probably in Ust? That's not what I meant. Can we just change the subject, please? Kang. You already think like an American, Jo. If you want to know about my sexual needs, just ask me directly and get it over with. I'm not exactly deprived, you know. I just look for someone who can deliver. Holy mother of God! Josefina! Well, she asked. I just said I'm not deprived. There are a lot of men out there. Do you want me to tell you how... - Never mind. - Suit yourselves. Wait, mahjong. You know, I've kissed a girl. - Just a kiss? - Yes. Where? - Are you sure it was just a kiss? - Yes. You're slow! Trining is a respectable girl. She's still a girl! Why? Have you already done it? Of course. I'm already 16. You mean the actual deed? Not just that. With whom? - In fact I just did it last night. - Someone from here?! Who? A woman! Who's this woman? You might tell someone else. No! Who? Doctor Jo. You were the one who saw it, right, Milo? Don't lie. No. Not me. Tibo was the one who saw it. No. Not me. Why not you? - No. I don't want. - If you want, I'll go for it. Hey! What are you doing? What's your business here? - I didn't know you needed supervision. - It's not like that. So that's why you never finish your tasks in one day. You're too busy horsing around. You're all a pain in the neck! Estrella? Where's the old man? I just got here. Isn't he at the orchard? He usually goes there. He's not there. Saint Peter, Saint John! Where did that old man go? I think he's becoming senile. My master is way better than you in many respects! Sons of bitches! Get back to work! Don Claudio! Señorito! It's almost dinnertime! Señorito! - Hey, you! - What? - No! - What is it? - Where did he put it? - Okay, I'll wait for you. There's the old man! - All right, Temyong. You can go home now. - Hey. - We have to be early tomorrow. - Lucio's inviting us. Sure. I wonder where Tating is. I already asked Melchor to look for her. Tating couldn't have wandered far. Besides, her clothes are still here. Estrella was the one who last saw Tating. She said Tating was looking for Don Claudio. - I saw Maring... - Really? - with Lucio. - Has the old woman been found? Not yet, Melchor! It's a good thing the girls are already sleeping. I'm sure they'd also be worried about their nanny. What happened, Melchor? We didn't find her, Señora! Don't stop looking until you find her! Yes, Señora! Nena, get some rest for now. We're helpless at the moment. Melchor! Melchor! - There's a fire! - Where? Over there! I don't know where exactly! - It's frightening! - Inday. I don't want you to panic. Jo! - What is it, Jo? - Wake the children up. My god! - I have a bad hunch. - There's trouble? I don't know, but I have a bad feeling. My god! Help me! Hail Mary, full of grace... - Should I wake the girls? - Wake them up. Help me! Open the door! Inday! Estrella! - The Japanese! - Papa! - The Japanese are here! - Papa! - Hey! - What? What do I do now? - Do whatever you want! - I don't know what to do. Find out for yourself. What am I going to do? Talk to her. Tell her stories. Sing to her if you want to! So many stars tonight. How many do you think there are? I don't know, Señorito. Maggie! Trining. Hurry up and pack your things. - Why, Mama? - No more questions! Mama! Margarita! Margarita! Change the lens! What? Change the... You do it, Jo. Look, Milo! What's that? - What's happening there, Jo? - Why is Nanny Tating not here? - Why hasn't she come back? - Maggie! - What can you see? - Nanny Tating! - Trining! - Don't leave me! Maggie! - Nanny Tating! - Maggie, please! - Come down! - Nena! There they are, Melchor! There! Hey! - Hey! - Here! - Right here! - Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Look here! - Hey! - Just look over here! Hey! The Japanese! Hurry up! You idiot! - That's mine! - This is mine! I said this is mine! Maggie! Trining! How can you play at a time like this?! You're acting like children! Nanny Tating! Why aren't you moving? What's wrong with you two? Pack anything you can pack! Do it! We won't accomplish anything if we all break down. Organization. We need a system. Uncle Claudio. Inday... Shut up... please. Just pack the essentials. Don't bring luxury items. Yes, sir. Pack things that are easy to carry. Come here, Estrella. You're in charge of the food. Yes, sir. Get someone to help you. Clara, Lydia! Come and help me! Hurry! Leave that behind, Nena. You won't be able to use that. All the medicine is in the box. Bring it out first. Go, take it. Where is Miguel? Miguel? Miguelito! Our Father, who art in heaven... Miguelito! Miguelito! Cygnus, Aldebaran, Andromeda. And over there is Phoenix. Hey, straight ahead! Over here. - Milo! - Señorito Miguel... Señorito Miguel... - your mother's looking for you. - Hey! Milo, where's my telescope?! Señorito, is there anything else to carry? There's more. Up there. That can wait until later! Take care of the carabaos first! You? Hurry! Come on! - Lucio! - Mother! Lucio, son! Enough! - Miguelito... - Señora. Señorito Miguel has been found. Where? Where is Miguel? He's downstairs, Señora. - He's helping with the loading. - Thank goodness! The dolorosa, the San Ramon. Go to the chapel and get those! Yes, Señora. Hail Mary, full of grace, our Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among... I ofended you so many times, but not anymore. I beg you to forgive me. Señor. The Infinite God. Forgive me. I can't bring all of you. What are you doing here? You have work to do! - The carabaos! - Yes, sir! Hey, you! Follow me. Hurry! Yes, sir! I swear. I swear to you all, as soon as the war is over, I will have a new chapel built for you. And I will have new clothes made for you. Please forgive me! I swear I'll do it all! Lydia, what's keeping you? Estrella! Why are you still inside?! Estrella, call the other maids so they can help you. Make sure you bury my things, make sure you bury them deep. Put them inside sacks. Do you understand? - Do you understand? Answer me! - Yes, ma'am! Yes! Nanny Tating! Don't cry. You need to be strong. It's more important that we survive. Leave that. We're not certain that where we're going is safe. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. We can't just leave without Nanny. Damn it! Enough! Melchor, let's go. Idiot! Make sure we've got everything! We're leaving now! Nothing will happen as long as... Stay together! Take care of Don Claudio. - Yes. - Be careful! - Yes! - Let's go! Hey! Temyong, Señor Claudio is on his way down. Just wait here. Trining... Trining! Temyong! Good morning, Don Claudio. Lucio! Señorita! Señorita! Let's go! - Señorita! - Wait! I'm coming! Hurry up! Señorita! Okay! Señorita! Mama! Mama! - Mama! - Yes? - Mama, Milo heard something in the forest! - Those... Estrella! Milo saw something by the river! - Where? - We don't know but Milo saw it. - What was it? - I think it was human. - I couldn't see it clearly. - I don't understand. Speak slowly. What did you see? - It is really true that... - I'm not sure. - Idiot! Why aren't you sure?! - Find Melchor. Mahjong? I don't think I want to. How much do I owe you anyway? Nena, 2,355 pesos. Never mind. I have a headache. It's too hot here. And the insects are too noisy. Inday, 3,725 pesos. Pardon? That's how much you owe me. I'll pay you. But I'm not asking you to pay me now. When the war is over. What is it? - I'm looking for Doctor Jo. - What? What? Doctor Jo is resting. Go, Lucio! Go! Inday, aren't you feeling well? It's just hot here. I can't sleep well at night. Damn it! Miguelito! Temyong, come here! Temyong, father is calling for you. - Miguelito! - What is it, Grandpa? Get some water. - Good evening, Señora. - Good evening. You didn't answer me. What are you doing here? You might catch a cold and come down with a fever afterwards. Just give me a minute, Mama. Go home now. Just one more minute, Mama. What do you get from staring at the sky? My goodness! That's why the people here are beginning to suspect that my son is crazy. - They just don't know. - That they're the crazy ones? - It's so beautiful, Mama. - Oh, dear lord! Polaris, Cassiopeia... Pollux, Castor... ask them to come down so we can introduce them to the others. Ten minutes. Be home in ten minutes. You'll be in trouble if you're not home in ten minutes. Stars! Constellations! I will die of frustration! Fonso. Stars and frustration. Lamb of God... Forgive us Lord... Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world. Forgive us Lord... Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world. Forgive us Lord... Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world. Lord, have mercy... In the name of the Father... Good evening. Good evening too. - Good night, Señora. - Good night. - Good night, Señora. - Good night, Señora. - Good night, Señora. - Good night. - Trining... - Good evening, Señora. Good evening, Señora. Don Claudio! Placido?! One more. Careful. Wait. - Let me fix it. There. - Thank you so much. - Watch this. - I'll just check on the others. - I'll take care of it. - Okay. Put that back. Don't worry. There are too many of you in the kitchen. Send the others downstairs to keep watch. Yes. Let's go. Have something to eat. The weapons from the Americans arrived last July, Don Claudio. A submarine carried the firearms. And Villamor has been recalled to Australia. They made Abcede the commanding officer. That's why Mata is now in charge of the 2nd infantry division. And Baclagon was designated as the division chief of staff. How are you, Uncle Claudio? I'm good. - Lay him here. Careful! - Tibo. Fonso! Hold him! - We'll fix it. Hold him. - His head on this side. - Hold him! - Okay! Milo! Hold him! Hold him! Hold him. Hold him tightly! Thank you very much. Is there anything I can do to help? Don't be a nuisance! Boil some more water. - Get out of the way. - Hold on. Hold him still. Hold him! - Viring! - That's what they learned. Damn it! Help us! If you don't help us I'll make you swallow all those jewels! And through the merits of my Lord. Don't move him. January, February March, April, May June, July, August September, October November, December Lubi-lubi Poor children. I'm not a child, ma'am. I can get a girl pregnant. My goodness! Two of our men died. They died fighting. Meanwhile, there are cowards in our midst. Still enjoying the good life and hiding under their mothers' skirts. Am I right? Yes, you're right. Son of a bitch. No balls. Still wets his pants, I'm sure. Miguel has a heart ailment. If he wasn't sick, my friend would have been in Bataan or Corregidor by now. Melchor, thank you for the... Thank you very much, Don Claudio. We'll help as long as we can. Hermes will be able to assist you as soon as he recovers. At least there'll be an addition to the men here, which is good for security reasons. We'll take care of him. It's not a problem. We also need some help around here. Thank you. Here are his belongings. This is his too. Too bad he wasn't wearing this amulet when the Japanese caught him. I want to ask something from you. It would help us a great deal. Thank you. Atong! Hey! - Come back, will you? - We'll go ahead, Don Claudio. Take care. Until then, Don Claudio. Thank you. Assist our comrades. - Inday. - Minggoy. Be careful. Goodbye, Uncle. Margarita. May the lord watch over you. Be careful, my sons. Let's go! That's nothing. Be careful. Okay. Be alert! Take care! Thanks to all of you! Tibo! Tibo, Tibo! Careful. I'll take care of your son. How much? Expensive. - Viring. - What? What happened to your jewelry? - Oh, I don't wear it anymore. - Why? Is it tarnished? - I just want to be cautious. - About what? Who knows when those guerillas will come back? They might take interest in my jewels. Right? Or maybe they'll ask for a donation. I don't want to take chances. I always play safe. Which is also why I'm having second thoughts about going out for a stroll. I hear there's a spirit lurking around the forest. Do you also believe in that, Viring? Why would I take chances? What if it's true that there's a fairy out there in the forest? It's true. I saw her once. She was walking. See, Viring, the old man is way ahead of you. It depends on the girl. It just hurts the first time. First time? Haven't you done it with Miguel? No. That depends on the man. How so? If the man is good in bed, you won't feel pain. There are a lot of bastards that play rough. But if the man is good, it will give you pleasure too. And then what? Oh, Trining. It's natural for humans to feel sexual pleasure. That's why women all over the world give birth every day. Doctor Jo! What? Aunt Viring sent me to fetch you! They don't want me in the quorum! She wants you there! Doctor... do they also feel pleasure? If you can please a man, you'll have him by the nose. You know, the guerillas are making progress. I heard they attacked two Japanese camps. Those bow-legged soldiers panicked! I heard that many of the Japanese were killed in the attacks. They've grown to fear Baclagon. Well, what do you know? But you know, I think Japan will be sending more troops to our country, because they're losing in this war. Where did you hear that news, Viring? You don't go out of the house. And we don't have a radio here. I can't tell you, Nena. Melchor! That cannot be! That's enough! But they didn't pay me! Pay up! Melchor! Oh, the fat one? Over there. Okay. We won't stop until we finish this. Melchor! Fonso! Have a drink! Friends, this is Alfonso, my comrade. This is Primitivo. Aren't we going home yet? Señora Inday will be worrying by now. To hell with that bitch! Let's drink! - Thanks. - Tibo! I'm good. This is the only time we've given ourselves this kind of a break. You can go if you don't like it here! What will we tell Señora Inday? Tell her I said, "Fuck you." Goodness, Miguelito! - Do you want to kill me? - Ma? What time is it?! I thought something bad had happened! - Lucio and I just went shooting. - Shut up! You're a bad influence, Lucio! You keep dragging my son with you to God knows where! I was the one who wanted to go shooting, Mama. Don't you dare get smart with me, Miguelito! As for you, Lucio, if my son got harmed in any way, you could never pay back for his life even with ten of yours! Inday... I can throw you out of my house. You bring nothing but distress to our home. You and your family. Come on. Miguel is already here. Your mama just got nervous. Go inside and eat. Go inside, Trining. I'll be right there, Mama. Let's go inside. Hey! Later. What's wrong? You're the one who's tired, right? Go ahead then. What are you going to do here? Do you need to know everything that I do? Pong! So where did you meet your husband, Jo? I don't just sleep with white men. I also go for brown, black or yellow. If there was purple, why not? In New York or in Boston? Come, let's go outside. I'm already tired. I walked a great distance earlier. Please? I'm quite sleepy too. What were you doing in the bodega? Do you know what you're doing? You didn't even think of Miguel! Miguel had nothing to do with what I did. Miguel is your boyfriend but you're sleeping with another man. Sex has nothing to do with love. - Where did you... - That's why I did it with him. Besides, I'm going to marry Miguel. So I can't sleep with him. Makes sense, right? My god! Inday! Inday! I was robbed! Oh, no! Only two left! - Maybe you just misplaced it. - I got robbed! I'm not sloppy like you are! I got robbed! Inday! My solitaire diamond! I got robbed! - What? - You! Where is your husband?! Where is he?! They haven't returned from the market. Where is he? Where is that shameless Melchor?! Answer me! You must be conspiring with him! Traitors! Animals! There! There! There's the thief! Viring, you don't have proof. Why are you defending this monster?! How shameless! Give me my jewelry back! That is a harsh accusation, ma'am. How dare this devil lecture me! How can you be so sure that I stole it? You were the only one left here when we buried the guerilla, weren't you?! Weren't you?! Weren't you?! Melchor... Let's clear this once and for all. I didn't steal your jewelry. I just took what is rightfully mine. - What are you talking about...? - Shut up! While you sit around all day playing mahjong and eating, I sweat blood all the time just to provide for your needs! Those rings I took from you are payment for my services! - I have the right to take those! - Ingrate! You're the ingrate here. Who's the one who took charge of this place? You would've all died of hunger if I weren't here! Leave if you want to. You didn't even consider the fact that if it weren't for my husband, you'd still be an ordinary worker, harvesting cane. And though you came from mud, we took you in and made you our foreman. And this is how you repay us? Bastard! You animal! I'm leaving. Let's see if you can eat your mahjong tiles. You. You're coming with me. No. Lucio is my son. He's not yours. Are you going to let these people enslave you forever? Are you going to waste your life serving these worthless human beings? I'm not going with you. You're useless anyway. You're just as stupid as your mother. You can never be more than a slave. And you? Who among you wants to leave? Fine. You all belong together. We'll see each other again. If not here on Earth, then in hell. How? Me? I can't do that. You! I think I'm a better gardener than you are, Mr. Fonso. You're right, Señorita. You're ready to settle down. Can I talk to you? Give your boyfriend some respect, Trining. Don't work yourself up over a headache. I know what happened last night. Why are you meddling in my personal life? I'm ashamed of what you're doing. Don't be ashamed on my account. I'm scared. I'm so scared. I don't like it here. I want to go home. I want to live. I'm confused. I want... I want to live. Where is Nanny Tating? When a person is scared, shame becomes insignificant. It's easier to forget shame than fear. I want... I just want to live. Your views on life are so shallow. You don't even think of the people who love you. Is it so hard to understand? I love Miguel. But I love myself more. I don't know. I'm confused. Trining... - Cross the stream! - Miguel! Shoot him! Shoot him! Miguel! Shoot him, Miguel! Help me! Shoot him! He was not alone. Pardon? The Japanese are getting close. Don't talk that way. Oh, what a thing to say, old man! You're going to give me a heart attack! We should be careful. Okay, get some rest now. Let's eat. Where is Miguelito? He probably doesn't have the face to show himself. Trining! He's young so you should cut him some slack. To be a man. You're after something else in a man. If you're interested in Miguel, then he's all yours! He's not looking for a girlfriend anyway. He wants a mother. A woman who will rock him to sleep. You're older than him anyway, right? How malicious! Who between us is acting like an animal now? Don't you know that snakes are also animals? I think I forgot to thank you. Where is he? Mama! When are you going to the market? I don't know. - Buy me a new machete, will you? - Give me the money! That's enough! Come on! Tibo! Temyong! Temyong! The kid! There! Good morning. Everyone out. Just for a moment. I will sit here. Is there cheese? I'm really hungry. Our reason for coming here is actually simple. My friends and I have agreed to come for a visit because we know that you can give us provisions. Food, weapons, rice. You have more than what you need. We want you to share what you have with us. We'd also like some of the shiny jewels of... Hello! Of fat lady. Señora Viring. Señora... How rude! - Oh! She refuses. - Señora Viring. - Give it to him. - Viring, give it to him. Give it to him! Señora... Let me go! - Give it to him, Viring! - Melchor, stop it! - Give it to me. - No! - Melchor! - Let's take it. You should've given it up sooner. Hey, stop! Melchor! Let me go! Let me go! See? Your bastard son would still be alive if only he had joined me. Lucio! - No. She's my wife. - So she's your wife. Monster! Brute! Son of a bitch! Don't, Melchor! Show some mercy! No! No! Don't you want to sit down? Sit. Mahjong. - Get the mahjong set. - Right. What? Feels so good! Pong. Go ahead! Your turn! Your wife, Melchor! That's enough! Take all the rice. All the food. All the weapons. Come on. Hurry! Let's take everything. Each will take what he wants. Grab whatever you can. No more rice here. Don't, Melchor. What do you mean? Not the child. You can have your way with me instead. No thanks, Doctor. The two men and the other young woman are missing. Forget about it. That's not what I meant. We're in a dangerous situation here. Damn it! No! Let's go! Trining! Trining! Goodbye, Lucio. It's so difficult. Are we just going to plant vegetables here for the rest of our lives? When will the war end? Temyong... Is he gone? He's not going to come back. Hermes will be back. I know he will. What did Miguel say? Is he still hoping that Hermes will come back? It's been three weeks since he left. It was Hermes who decided to set out on his own to look for Trining. He just needs to find my sister and then Hermes will fetch Miguel afterwards. We need a man to stay here with us. I think Mama is losing her curls. It's because you don't ask Aunt Viring to curl it for you anymore. You also know how to curl hair, don't you, Doctor Jo? Yes. There you go, Mama. Do you want to get your hair curled too, Aunt Viring? Viring, is it true that Luis Homa is not the real son of the old Enrique? Yes. Luis is the son of his brother and their laundrywoman. In fact, it became a big problem because that brazen laundrywoman got greedy. Those bastards are all the same. They're covetous. Hey, Señorita Inday. Do I have to build your wall for you? What? I'm sorry. You better hurry! You owe me a lot of money. You too, Nena. I have all your debts on my list as well. Oh, but what happened to the Gomezes was worse. Right, Inday? Yes. I wouldn't know what to do if it happened to me! My god! Poor people! From the heavens down to Earth. I salute you in admiration, Virgin of Peace. This sanctuary is in your honour from the impious who adores you. You are our protector against the Devil. I salute you in admiration, Virgin of Peace. May your Holy Spirit fill us with every grace and blessing so that we may pursue what leads to peace for all humanity. I salute you in admiration, Virgin of Peace. Inspire our thoughts, words and deeds to bear witness to your presence in our hearts. I salute you in admiration, Virgin of Peace. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women And blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Hermes! Trining is my sister. But if I had a choice, I wouldn't want you to be in danger. Nothing bad will happen to me. Don't go. She went with them. It was her choice. What more do you want? It's not a want but a need. Need is different from want. You don't have to prove anything to anyone. I thought you understood what this was about? I need this. Not for my mama, your mother, or Trining. Not even for you. - Miguel... - This is for me. Don't leave, Miguel. I'll come back. Excuse me. I have something to give you. Help from an old man. Thanks, Grandpa. God bless you. Come on! Drink some more! We have plenty! No one will be left alive! And all their jewelry will be... Eeny, meenie, miny, moe... ...divided among us! Sir, tell us about the laundrywoman you raped! Well, she washed my clothes right after I fucked her! It's your turn! You cover your mouth when you talk. - Igme! - Give me some of that! You, come clean and admit that you've been stealing! Guido, did Ande say yes? You should never let her go. Why didn't you end up together? Her father was against our relationship. Because I'm poor. We went swimming. But he drowned. Doesn't he know how to swim? He does. I really don't know what happened. Here! Enough! What was that? I thought there was something wrong. - What was that shot? - What was that?! Maybe she's freaking out again. Don't! Gunshot! Stay there. Get away from here! Hurry up! No! Don't! Here! There! Disperse! The kid... Hey! What? Let's not waste this opportunity. Let's finish them all off. I... I can do this. I can do everything now. Go over there. No! I don't want to! I hope the baby looks like you. I want to have a girl, but my husband's family wants a baby boy. You know how the Chinese are. Aren't you scared? Giving birth the first time is hard. When is your wedding? Next month. Miguel still has a lot of things to attend to. I might move to Manila for good. What about the property Don Gregorio left in your care? We'll see. You must be looking for someone who can help you, Charlie. I'll think about it. - All the lands and properties? - Yes, all of those. When Doña Desta died, Emilio was named the only heir. Imagine that. And even her properties in Escolta were transferred to his name. Come and eat. It's hard when there's no man around to help. Aren't you going to eat? We have spam here. He is Major Metcalfe. Emilio, maybe you'd like to eat even just a little. Please. The corned beef and spam are really delicious. Major Metcalfe gave them as a gift. That American is so kind. He even gave us chocolates. Do you want to go to your room, Uncle Claudio? Just tell me when you want to rest. I'll take care of it. Just two. I don't want a lot. No one's entertaining his companion. Maybe you can introduce him to Trining. Just a minute. How are you? I heard she became the mistress of the Japanese, that's why... Come with me, Daniel. I'll introduce you to my sister. - Go on. - Let's go. He rescued Ramon from Capas. Trining. This is Daniel Ledesma, Ramon's friend. They fought together in Bataan. I'll leave the two of you for a while. I don't shake hands with people I just met. My mama will get mad at me. My friends! My friends! We're gathered here tonight to celebrate two occasions. First, tonight is a thanksgiving party, for the war is finally over. Four years of dread. Four years of being separated by tragic circumstances. We are giving thanks because God gave us the chance to be together once again. And the second, and more important occasion. This gathering is in honor of two people very dear to us. The union of our beloved Lorenzos and Ojedas, through the marriage of Margarita, and Miguel. Maggie and Miguel. Nena. Go ahead, Nena! - Inday. - Inday! Come on, Inday. To their happiness! To their happiness! - Cheers! - Cheers! She has no sense of decency. She didn't even consider our family's honor. We have all become animals. This war, has turned us all into animals, Naty. Grandpa. And who are you? We need some music! Music! - Maybe... - Señora. May I have this dance, Señora? Minggoy. Nena. I thought you'd leave me here standing and ashamed, Captain.
