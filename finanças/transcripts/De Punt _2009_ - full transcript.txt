based on the second train hijacking by Moluccans in 1977 near De Punt What's the matter? I hear something. There's nothing out there. Everybody to the front. -To the front. Stay down. Philippus, get down. Nora. Dear Mr. Pattipeimena. In a TV program about Moluccans in Holland... we want to focus on the train hijacked at De Punt. Due to your daughter's involvement, we kindly invite you to participate. Our aim is not to reconstruct events, but to explain the reasons for this attack. The hijacking made history for the violence of the assault... and the presence of a female hijacker: Noor Pattipeimena. Much has been published about the hijacking... but little is known about the first female terrorist in the Netherlands. With you and four guests who knew her and were involved in the attack... we want to show who she was. We believe that telling this story will serve the Moluccan community... and in particular the deceased Noor Pattipeimena. Good afternoon, Koen. -Good afternoon, Uncle Tjak. What can I do for you? Are you going to participate in that TV program we were invited for? No. No, I'm not going. I'm very busy. There is a lot of work. Many people know nothing about our history, let alone about Noor. Only you and I know about her. Besides, I think you owe it to her. I don't really feel like digging up the past. There's no point to it. Why don't you take your responsibility? Why are you so stubborn? Why don't you admit your guilt? Guilt? Yes, guilt. -That's rich coming from you. I will carry my responsibility with me until the day I die... but I will not let them sully Noor's name. Will you come? No. So you don't want to come along? No, I'm not going. Listen. -What's going on? Listen to this guy. Go on, tell him. We are going to hijack a train. No, seriously. You mean us? -Yes. No way. -No way? The boys of Wijster must be released. Yes, hijacking a train a second time... No one expects that. Really. lf no one is killed, it could succeed. What's the matter? Don't go. I don't want you to do it. Nora, I must do it. For the Mollucan Islands, for our parents. We must fight. And what about us? What about that? -No, no. I gave them my word. -I'm going home. Not now. Inside. Shut up, before I do something stupid. Get inside. You better go. Please sit down. Sit. How many times have I told you to stop seeing him? I'm talking to you. We have a blood bond, we are pela. That was in the old days, Papa. That was then. What old days? It's a disgrace. You shame me. It's always about you, isn't it, Dad. It's not about me. Are you worried something terrible will happen to me... or are you worried about what the neighbors will say? I love him. Please, Papa. I really love him. lf I see you with him one more time, I never want to see you again. Attention. Line up in four rows. Listen up. As of now any contact with the home front or the outside world is forbidden. No visitors, no telephone calls to girlfriends, or the old lady. No trips to the local bar. You will not leave this area. Set up your tents and be back here in half an hour. Dismissed. March. Hans. -Nico. I hear you were there in '75 as well. Yes. What do you think? -About? Will we take action right away? -No. Chances are we won't see any action at all. In '75 we saw no action either. Hans, why are you here? -Hi, Nico. I tried to call, but I heard you were at work. We need to talk. OK, come on in. -Right. What are you doing here? This was in the mail. What's it to me? -I thought I'd tell you. This is about you. -Yes. So? Are you going? lf I do, it will be for you. -Then don't, it's a lost cause. No, it isn't. We can finally address it. I don't get you. How can you live with this? I have to get back to work. Guys, it's very difficult to talk to you like this. Will you allow us to bring you a field phone? I see that you made a signal with a flash light. Two light flashes means you agree. Understood, thanks. Don't do it. -I'll be right back. Did you make contact? -Go back. I have a list of the medicines we need. We need aspirin, sedatives and an inhaler for a woman with asthma. And sanitary towels. -Get back in there now. We need the medicines... -Shut up and move. We're thirsty. -I'll kill you. Calm down. -Do you want to die? I'll shoot you. I'm going to kill him. I'm not scrubbing in. Give me gloves. -Hurry. Any output? -Barely. Let's go. 100... Can I go in? -Yes. Scalpel. Asystole, heart massage. Administer epinephrine. Yvonne, wake up. What are you doing? -More epi. Output is restored. Well? -He survived. What's the matter? -Nothing. What's wrong? Is this about that letter? Yes. They're making a TV program about the hijacking. They want me to talk about it, together with... Noor Pattipeimena's father and a surviving hijacker. When did you last talk to them? I never talked to her father and I never saw the hijacker after that. I never got around to it. This is your chance. That's easier said than done. But I should have done it long ago. Your daughter is downstairs. What's wrong? -Nothing at all. Then why are you here? I brought you some cake, for your coffee break. Do you think that cake and a smile will fix everything? It's not that simple. That's not why I did it, Papa. -Here, take it. Go home. Look, I'm a security guard. I've always been one, really. During Wijster, De Punt, now... Always have been. It's not about if I did the right thing or not. I want to protect people. So you won't change your mind. I'm surprised you want to go instead of me. I figured as much. lt won't be easy. You will not be very welcome. I appreciate your effort to keep me out of harm's way. But it is my story. You were right about that. I'm buying. Who is there? It's me. How are you? What is the matter with you? You look like you've seen a ghost. You know, if I were you, I'd go. Tell them that minister Van Agt betrayed us. I don't feel like talking about it. - You don't feel like it? Let me tell you, if you value our friendship, you'd go. You have to tell it all. I don't know if I can control myself. Remember? What? Move over. Why is she here? I'm in. -What are you up to? Like I said: I'm in. -You can't be serious. You need more people. Here I am. I support the attack. -This is not a game. With a woman among us it might work. In that case, I'll bring my mother. Ever fired it? It's not that hard. -Right. Then show us. Not bad. Is it your father's? -Yes. Nice one. Issued by the colonial army. OK, tomorrow, eight-thirty. Mr. Mannuputty, I'm Peter de Jong. You want to participate, I hear? I want to know if Mr. van Agt will be there. We're still working on it. -You're not sure. People like that always confirm at the last minute. It's important for him to be there. -Indeed. But can we count on you, Mr. Mannuputty? You can. -That's quite a relief. Most of the hijackers are no longer alive. I'll send you a confirmation with directions and the like. There you are. -Thank you, Lizette. I was the only person who was in contact with Noor Pattipeimena. And you were involved in the case. -You wrote that, yes. But anything I have to say on that issue is public knowledge. Must I repeat it? -The show is about Noor Pattipeimena. They want to show who she was. -No. To me she represents the Moluccan struggle. I believe I know where you are headed with this. I'm not sure I'm the right one to do that. -I believe you are. It's important for someone to make a gesture to the Moluccan community. I can't promise anything, but I will consider it. I repeat: if no one can tell me how many casualties we're talking about... I think this is an unacceptable risk. There are no guarantees. Stokroos, I mean Stokreef, there are no guarantees and yet you indicate... that all the passengers on the train can be freed. What are the chances? That is hard to say, but if I had to make an estimate... I would say, if we act swiftly... that we count on killing all the terrorists, plus, and we hope not... but we might lose some of the hostages. Is it possible to eliminate the hijackers without killing them? We will attempt it, but they are armed. But if I hear you correctly, you can predict with certainty... that almost all passengers will be liberated. I'm Yvonne. I'm here for the program A Different Perspective. Wait there, someone will come for you. Yvonne Verweij. I was in the train. -Pattipeimena, Noor's father. You are Koen. Hello and welcome. Thank you for coming. I'm Peter de Jong. Let's go to makeup and start the show. Good of you to come, Mr. van Agt. OK, people. Clear the set, please. Attention for the opening in five, four, three... In 1977 nine Moluccans hijacked a train near De Punt... to focus attention on their struggle. There was a young woman among them: Noor Pattipeimena. Though much was published about the hijacking, little is known of her. Noor has the dubious honor of being Holland's first female terrorist. But who was she, and how did the hijacking affect those involved? This is A Different Perspective. Ms. Verweij, on the morning of May 23 you were traveling to Groningen. We had just celebrated my parents' 25th wedding anniversary. So I took the train on Monday instead of Sunday like I usually did. This is a hijacking: get up, get up. Keep walking. Get up. Get up. Come with me. Come with me and keep walking. Once the hijackers decided who would stay and who could leave... there were 54 of us left. We had to cover the windows, so people couldn't see in the train. The entrances and exits were secured with chains. Mr. Pattipameina. Did this second hijacking surprise you, so soon after the one in '75? We hoped that the Dutch government would recognize the RMS after the first. But nothing at all happened. Our leaders weren't even given the opportunity to discuss future policy. That upset us, and even the young people. But weren't most of them born and raised here? Why fight for a country they don't know? -You forget that we lived in camps. Segregated from Dutch culture: little Ambon in the Netherlands. You didn't deem it necessary to integrate us. We were here temporarily, right? -And Noor? Did you know that she was involved in the attack? I was stunned. Nora, what's the matter? -Nothing. What's wrong? -Nothing. lt went well. What more do you want? I was afraid you would shoot. -Shoot? You know me. Be patient. We'll be gone in no time. Men, here they are: eight men and one woman. Their names are Agus, Anis... Mozes, Patti-something-or-other, so and so.. . Forget the names, but look at their mugs. Be patient. We are waiting for instructions. And if they start executing people again? -In case of emergency, we act. And don't be fooled by that pretty face. Women in these cases are the worst. Once they take that step, expect anything. I should know, I married one. I said it then and I'll say it again, let this be a warning: You can't demand things by force in this country. Everyone should know this. You can't threaten innocent people with guns and start making demands. Yes, all you did was make false promises and ignore us. I think you are exaggerating just a little. Am I? We were brothers, we fought together. We died for the kingdom. -That's right. But here, we were no longer needed. We were fired. But we had a lost our homeland, we could not go back. We had become orphans, children without a country. You were in a discussion near the entrance. Agus, the fanatic, and Noor came towards me. With ropes. I thought I was going to die. Get up. Get up. Get up. Are you deaf or something? And keep walking. No, no. Please. -Move. lf you kill me, I will haunt you. You will have no peace for the rest of your life. I'll come after you. Then they explained their intentions. I was to stand outside... I asked them for a change of clothes. I didn't want my parents to see their daughter's execution. My parents can't see me. -You won't be killed. I don't want my parents to see me like this. She told me not to worry, that they were not going to kill me. And I'm thinking to myself: but in '75 you did execute people in cold blood. I see a hostage with a rope around his neck. Dirty bastards. Telephone. They're going to execute a hostage. We have to act. Listen, they're going to execute a hostage. We have to act. But she kept telling me not to worry. lt was a mock execution. They were only doing it to make a point. But I couldn't trust her. She then put her denim jacket over my head. And I thought they probably wouldn't shoot holes in their own jacket. We stood out there for some time. Do you know how it feels, Koen? To stand there thinking you're going to die? To think you're 22 years old, and on a stupid day in May... on some stupid track, a bullet... In spite of it all, I wanted to get to know her. This fear of death... and the fact that you believed we had abandoned you, must be awful. But although you might have felt we were far removed from it all... your well-being was always on our mind. How is she doing? -OK, I guess. She's strong, she'll live. Did you hear that? Open the door. I'm sure I heard something. Like what? -Be quiet. Let's go back in. We were under the train placing listening devices. We could practically touch you. We were that close. I had you covered, I could have eliminated you easily. In '75 we had to watch as they executed people. I remember clearly how you shot one us through the head. Our superiors did not allow us to act. The risk was too big. -You were not allowed to act... because we wanted to consider all the risks involved. We were responsible for your actions. -You, responsible? My ass. I was the only one held responsible after the fact. I was threatened by Moluccans, shots fired through my window. I had to move. For years I carried a weapon. Wherever I went I would sit facing the exit. In trains I sat near the doors, in case I had to leave in a hurry. Even though, as you all just heard, I was not responsible. A breakthrough with the hijackers at De Punt. We just heard that... Tjak, I know that this is difficult for you. But you should actually be proud of what Nora is doing. I know I am. Don't you agree? In other words, what Noor is doing for the Moluccan people... is of the utmost importance. She is a hero. Never forget that. Here, some goodies for you. -Thanks, Sister. Shall we have some coffee? -Yes, thanks. There is something else I want to tell you. lf you are ever in trouble, we will support you. Don't ever forget. What's going on? Someone's coming out. They were taken to the hospital in Groningen for examination. Will the hijackers get safe passage, Mr. van Agt? They're freeing the hostages, they'll get safe passage. Do you think so, Tjak? Well, Tjak? What do you think, Tjak? I think we should calmly wait and see. We wanted our people's respect, then go into exile with the 21 prisoners. They never said we couldn't leave, but there were many obstacles. We could not take any passengers... there were delays in transferring the prisoners... then Eelde airport was out, no pilot would fly us. Suddenly they found one, but we had to release a passenger. Which we did. We released two pregnant women, so we could leave. Listen up, everybody. A bus will take us to Eelde airport. Really? -At last. Will you release us at the airport? Most of you, but we need volunteers to fly abroad with us. Any volunteers? We have to stick together. Then we'll pick them. Dutch bastards. They are playing games with us. We have to hold out. Hold out. Call them again. What for? -What do you want? Yes, what do you want? What are you doing here? I'll go with you. -They won't let us go. Shall I call them? It might have an impact if one of us calls. This is Yvonne Verweij, a passenger. We're ready to leave. Where is the bus? What do you mean, be patient? Who are you? You don't know? That's ridiculous. We've been waiting for hours and... Then let me speak to someone who does. Where is Van Agt? I want to speak to minister Van Agt. He hung up. You made demands that you wanted met by threatening people's lives. We decided to impede meeting your demands as much as possible. Did that include lying and making false promises? False promises? -Safe passage, and then reneging. But listen... safe passage means having the freedom to go to a particular destination. But then you have to say what your destination is. You must mention that right away. And so you lied. I don't consider that lying. And even if it was, I would not have minded. Because promises made under duress hardly carry a moral obligation. That shitty government of yours has abandoned you. Tomorrow you're all dead. Take it easy. -Why? They're screwing us. You bastard. Sit down. What's going on? -Get him out of here. Sit down and shut your mouth. They were stringing you along. Why not surrender? Because we kept hoping that they would keep their promise. We didn't want to use violence, no casualties. Were you ever going to let us go? No, I don't think so. How can you guarantee it will be swift? With the element of surprise. With Starfighters and extra firepower. Heavy machine guns. They will prepare... -Everything in me opposes this. Are those Starfighters necessary? -Meaning? lt turns into such a military operation. We can solve that. -Really? We can paint them white and write 'police' on them. I fail to see the humor, gentlemen. Have we exhausted all options? Shouldn't we keep talking... and use that time to our advantage? -Joop... you can't have the men be combat-ready and call it off... only to go back to being combat-ready later. You must have the courage to push on: and now is the hour. I'm sorry, Joop, but Dries is right. The country is disrupted. We must end this quickly in a way that prevents future incidents. The rule of law must be restored. Let's vote on it. -Very well. Who is against? In favor? I will inform the queen. I'm fed up with this. They are just lying to us. Come on, let's put one of them outside. What do you mean? -The 'no casualties' plan? It's not working at all. They're speculating. They're toying with us. So let's play. -What do you want? Kill someone every hour? They're asking for it. -And then they'll give in? Do you have a better idea? Do you want to reopen negotiations and release more people? lf we don't use violence now, we have nothing left. We keep our word, but they don't. They feel that they can lie and cheat. On the radio they are calling us animals. Animals. lf that's what they think, then we might as well behave like animals. What do we have to lose? -Everything. Not just our deed, but who we are. Let them play their games out there. No casualties, that was the deal. You want to put it to a vote? -Yes, let's vote. Those in favor? Why don't you raise your hand? Because I am against it. You are making a mistake. You are making a mistake. We clearly heard them say that they will not use violence. Nice work. It's like we are there. What did they say? What's up? That's classified. Not meant for your ears. You knew we would not use violence. You should have known. You deliberately ignored it. -Mr. Mannuputty. The hijacking was paralyzing the country for some time. The country was getting increasingly restless, uncertain. There was open animosity between the two population groups. The country could not endure this situation much longer. You could've acted earlier. -We could not. These operations require extensive preparations. We had to consider public support. The country had to accept the solution. And we had hope that the Moluccan mediators could exercise their authority. Guys, they think your demands are unreasonable. They reject them all. They promised. -Safe passage is impossible. They don't want that. No country wants you. Not Benin, nor Yemen, nor Vietnam. They would take care of that. -Unreal. Didn't I tell you? You can't trust the Dutch. It's true, my dad used to say it too. I respect what you are doing. In each and every one of you I see a freedom fighter. Just like my husband, Dr. Chris Soumokil. But I don't see a way out. The only option you have left is surrender. Surrender. They have guaranteed that you will not be harmed. So you want us to surrender? That is up to you. Do you want to go on? We'll come back tomorrow. I want an answer from you tomorrow. Right, we have to go. Till next time. -Thank you very much. So long. -Bye. Come here. Just a short note to tell you: do not trust Tan. Keep it up, Benin will take you in. -Thank god, we can go to Benin. Who's it from? -Mrs. Soumokil. She doesn't want us to give up. We'll go on, for her too. But she also said they won't let us go. We must surrender. What? We are so close. -Whatever happens, I want to go on. OK, one for all. -And all for one. Come on, let's go. Nico, come here. Take a look. They even have a flag. Guys, we have to report. We had decided to see this through to the end. You have a word for it, right? Korban, sacrifice. -That's right. My daughter gave her life for Maluku. That is korban. I heard Noor saw the hijacking as a way of saving her forbidden relationship. How dare you insinuate that? Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't it against adat, Moluccan custom? We had the same ideals. That's what counts. -Tell him you didn't have a relationship. Go on, tell him. Tell him. No, Uncle Tjak, we loved each other. She did it for Maluku, but mostly for you, hoping you'd accept our relationship. Men, good news. We are probably going in. With heat photos and listening devices we pinpointed where the terrorists are. The locations of the terrorists are: one man in the train's cockpit. Two men in the command post behind windows 3 and 4. One man behind door 5, one man behind window 20... three men behind windows 21 through 24. And finally, a man and a woman behind window 32. You all know your entry points, you know your targets. Memorize them: your life depends on it. -How much force can we use? Detain terrorists and eliminate if necessary. Meaning? -Eliminate means disable for combat. 'lf necessary' means do not shoot if a hijacker surrenders or is injured. So says the government's manual, which is for civil servants and not for marines. The country is disrupted and we must put a stop to it, that's our responsibility. On the one hand to restore the rule of law... and, if in any way possible, without the loss of life on the other. That was the minister on the hijacking which is going on twenty days now. Do you realize what the minister said? 'Restore the rule of law without loss of life# They are going to attack. -They won't risk the hostages' lives. They never have. -Forget it, they want us. You're talking like a dotty old bat. Isn't she? What's going on? Where are you going? Without loss of life can also mean that they understand... I have a bad feeling. -Knock it off. You must keep at it. Something is up. -Nothing is up. Use your common sense. Give me that. -You want it? Here. Can I have one of your cigarettes? I didn't know you smoked. -I didn't know budding doctors smoked. You'd be surprised how many doctors and nurses smoke. Are you expecting an attack? No... The government wouldn't endanger you. Where were you born? In the camp. Schattenberg. Former Westerbork. How was it? My mother hated it. She didn't want to be there. She died of homesickness... I believe. And your father? My father? He... Come, I'll take you back. You OK? Someone else took over her watch. She took me to my spot. I told her I was sorry we had to meet under these circumstances. She said that the first meeting with a Moluccan girl was usually more boring. We both laughed. Well? She said that we should proceed with our decision. But it troubled her. She is assuming that we have considered every option. That's it then. What do you mean? Let's just hope we made the right decision. All we can do is hope. And pray a little. There's nothing out there. Everyone to the front. -To the front. Stay down. Koen, where are you? Philippus, get down. Get up, now. Get up. Now. Stay down, stay down. Get up. You'd better stay down, ma'am. -I'll do as I please. Because I trusted you... and firmly believed in a safe passage, I lost Noor. The only reason I am here... is because I want to hear you say, I'm sorry. An acknowledgement of your mistakes. What use is it to you, if I, who no longer represents the government... declare that mistakes may have been made at the time? A lot of mistakes were made, Mr. van Agt. Do you think I came for the fun of it? That I like remembering that train? I shouldn't even be here today. I'm ashamed. I should be dead, not Noor. I personally believe that your people were treated disgracefully. I completely understand that you can only accept your history... which is so intertwined with ours... if the government performs some sort of act of contrition. but I do not think that I am the person to do that. Your daughter said one last thing. lt means: Papa, forgive me. Doesn't it? Why are you here? I brought you some cake, for your coffee break. Do you think that cake and a smile will fix everything? It's not that simple. Here, take it. Go home. That's not why I did it, Papa. You don't get it. I just wanted to say... -What? I just wanted to say... What?
