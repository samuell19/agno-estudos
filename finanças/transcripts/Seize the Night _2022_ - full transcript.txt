Angie? Open the door. Angie, please, please, please, please. How are we- This band is single-handedly saving the music industry. I can't believe we'll finally see the face behind the music. I know I'll be tuning into the live stream tomorrow morning for the unmasking. You keep requesting it. So here it is, the new single from SIN5. - Fuck yeah. - ...is Luna. What the fuck are you doing? This isn't part of the plan. I know. We talked about this. If they don't see it, they're gonna think something else. The papers are signed. I'm sorry. Fuck. Did you tell anybody else? No. From now on, it's better you don't know anything. Be ready when I need you. Of course. Where's the club? It's called the Hidden Gem. It's intimate. You wanna see some pictures? No, it's okay. I trust you. Are we good? No. The guests are starting to arrive. Are you sure about this? Can I get you a drink? No. What's up bro? GB. What do you do, GB? I'm a ski instructor. I own ski resorts. You're Windham? You can find him up those steps right there. Thank you. No problem. You must be GB. I appreciate a man who gets things done, sit down. You party? Good? Good. That was easy. Enjoy. You heard of suggestives? Yeah. What do you know? It's skip all the main base, for mind control. It targets the pineal gland in the back of the brain where the soul is supposedly located. Can you get some tonight? They're super expensive and even harder to find. Yeah. I know. I got a party downstairs and I got some thirsty people. If you can get some tonight, I'll pay you double the rate. Double? I don't like to repeat myself. I will let you know if I do. I'll be here. Have a nice night, GB. Perfect. The numbers speak for themselves. The Chinese have pre-ordered. We've got action figures, dolls, clothing, jewelry. We've got everything from shoelaces to mouse pads and bubblegum. Goodbye kitty. We're gonna be bigger than Coke. Cola. Have a drink. Hi. Hi. I like your Docs, they remind me of ninth grade. I've had them since ninth grade. You look cool. You look like you could be in a Tim Curry movie, or like a Sandman comic book. You seem comfortable in the dark. I like being mysterious. You down with the money moguls, or are you with the underground? Come out so I can see you. I like being in the shadows. What's your name? GB. GB? GG. Okay. I'll play along. Now what? Well it's a party going on. This place sucks. Would you be open to go on a quest? It depends. Have you ever heard of suggestives? What's that? Well, If you take the best components of every drug and you roll it into one, that's what you get. You can suggest anything within yourself to another person, or even together, and it will fucking happen. Information is faster than we know what to do with it. Nothing should be that accessible. Nothing brews anymore, especially in the arts. There's no passion. No identity. No identity, until now. But that's why you're all here. Without any further ado, ladies and gentlemen, I give you the lead singer of SIN5, The lead singer of SIN5. Excuse me. I'm just on the other side. What a cool bridge. It's called Shakespeare Bridge. Is that an indication of what's gonna unfold tonight? What does that even mean? I like this. Please get down from there. Seriously. Okay. What shall we do? Did you leave your date behind? No, he's more like my brother, just wants to know where I'm at. Oh, he's probably just looking out for you then. Oh, the Hollywood sign. Oh, your first time in LA? How long have you lived here? I grew up here. How do you like it? You can be honest. A lot of show and tell, so many people come and go. And I can only imagine how many dreams get crushed here every day. Yeah, I know what you mean. Well, like, you know, like the first time you come out here, you know, you don't know anybody. It's like, you don't know what you can eat next, you don't know where you're gonna sleep, so you better be good at whatever it is that you're doing. Like take musicians, for example, like the early stuff is usually better than the later stuff, because then they got some money and got driven around in limos all day long. Got too comfortable, you know? That's why there's so many one hit wonders. Yeah, exactly. That's why I wanted to stay hungry. So what were you doing at the party? You don't know what the party was for? No. You don't know? No. It was the unveiling of SIN5. What? Holy fuck, oh my God I fucking love SIN5 What do they look like? I don't know, they there were in and out. I really like their name, too. I wonder if it means- - Left. Last number five after seven. Yeah. What's your favorite song by them? There's too many. It's not Luna? Luna's up there, but that's like for only certain occasions. I imagine the song was written for nights like this, special occasions. 302 in the red. Double Jack. What's a 302? It's two 151's. For hardcore people. You didn't even want to bring me. I was just feeling you out. I thought it was gonna be an Illuminati party. I wish, I'm not that cool. Let's talk about you. Let's not, let's just lie to each othe What do you want to lie about? Anything inconsequential. That could be anything. Exactly. What's your porn name? Yeah, I know that one. Name of first pet and sweet. It's Sparkle Babcock. PP Interceptor. See? Who cares about names, as long as we're having fun. Cool. What's the craziest thing you've ever done. Peyote, with shamans. Did you find your spirit animal? No, I saw my dead grandfather. Do you really want to hear this? Yeah. I woke up during the wake. He's sleeping right next to me. And meanwhile, his casket is supposed to be outside, and his body's supposed to be in it. I mean, I've tripped hard before, but once I took some acid that was fucking double dipped, and dickhead forgot to tell me that. We went to the park, and I was so fucking high. Like literally like the world like turned upside down, and I'm holding onto the grass with my fingertips. So I wouldn't fall down into the fucking sky. What I'm saying is that, I know when I'm high and when I'm not. This time, it was real. He showed himself to say goodbye. Do you even believe me? Yeah, absolutely. Thanks. You? Out of body experience. Do tell. I was hanging out with these hippies, doing shrooms in the forest, a lot. And I was sitting on this stump, waiting for it to hit me basically. And everyone said, I was just sitting there very catatonic and not talking, and they thought it was fine, so they just all left. And the next thing I know, I am looking down from above the trees, and everyone's running around naked, and I was floating anywhere I wanted to go. And then I started to move into this really dark space. And I knew that if I continued, it would mean death. So I turned around. And that's why I believe in souls or energy consciousness. - And I'm not afraid of- - Dying. Living. Shall we inquire of our seekings. By any chance, do you know where we can get some suggestives? No. No. Anything? Everybody has some hearsay story, but nobody knows anything. Same here. I love this scene. Me too. I mean, why can't this be the norm? Why does plain and boring have to be the judges? Because if you reverse it, then the plain and boring would be the cool. Yeah, I guess. Have you ever been to Wave-Gothic-Treffe What's that? My God, it's a music festival in Leipzig, Germany, and the whole town turns goth for a week And you see these goth families with the cutest little goth babies. It'll never be the norm. Let them judge all they want. So you want to have a goth baby? What does a goth baby look like? Does he have like baby death hawk with like little burnsy wurnsies? We should have tried. She's pretty. Look at her. She's all free of an inhibition, in the moment, right here, right now. Go up there. I dare you. I mean what have you got to lose? Just pretend nobody's here. I dare you. All right. If I go up there, you have to do whatever I dare. No. Too late. That was so impressive. I think you deserve a 604. Can I get a hug instead? I hear those leave a cinnamon taste on your lips. Yo! Are guys looking for some suggestives? What? Are you interested or not? Come on, let's go talk somewhere quiet Step into my office. So. You guys try it yet? No. Dude, my last client, this fat fuck of a dude, he takes some, drops to the ground and this motherfucking slob starts doing pushups on two fucking fingers, man, over and over until three of the hottest girls in the club went home with him. Let's talk biz. All right. Four ounce bottle's 10 Gs. If you're serious, we can make it happen 10 Gs? 10 Gs? I got a lot of people here that want to see me, so- - We'll take it. You know it's cash only? I know. What are you doing with that much cash For emergency drug deals. It's fine, you don't have to pay me back Who are you? We got half. All right. I guess you'll get the rest at pickup. Okay, I'm cool with that. Message me, but do it soon. Fucking busy bro. Catch you guys later. So, where to now? The manor. Okay. What is this place? It's a therapy group that I go to, trade for trade. I give 'em meds, they give me money. Hey GB. Hey. How you doing man? Okay, the wine is here. Hey, how are you buddy? All right! Yeah man, I jack off all day long, man You know, to hentai. Cartoons only fucking get me hard now. You know, it's fucking evil. I just remember he kept saying, I love you, I love you, I just remember him saying that. And I thought to myself, Jesus, this man really loves me. My head was bleeding and there was blood all over. He broke my arm. To be perfectly honest with all of you, I felt, I believed him. I thought, if this is love, then I'm gonna take it. I promised myself I wouldn't do it again. I'd been alone for years and I was happy, 'cause I couldn't be hurt that way. And, and then I went to the department store I used to go to growing up. And I saw her. It was like love at first sight. Thank you. And thank you, Yuki, Chastity, for sharing. Addiction is a motherfucker. You know? But here we are, we're all in a safe environment, you know, GB, GG, would you like to share? I am not there. You don't want to go? Yeah, I mean like those cheeks and that little nose, it was just like, when you squeeze it. GG? Yeah? We really got to go. No, let's stay.

I'm with you. Okay? What are you doing to me? Okay. I just reacted, okay? You were so jealous and you were so cute. We're still short. So what are we gonna do? Fuck, I can't believe I got to do this Who the hell put up these lights? Your mom has that much cash. Yeah, she's a bit of a prepper. You know she got all brainwashed from my dad. Fuck, I don't know if I want to do this. What are you gonna tell her? I don't know. I'm really sorry if I woke you up tonight, mom. No problem. I can use the company. So what is it? What do you need the money for? I can double up my money by investing in something tonight. No you can't. Are you talking about drugs? Yes. No. Had you finished your studies you'd be in a big pharmaceutical company by now. That's spilled milk talk, mom, you know I hate spilled milk talk. If I give you the money, will you go back to school? Mom? I put in a lot for this house. Yeah, with drug money. So what? I earned it. This must look really weird to you. Yeah. I can tell when a person is lying. So I just stopped lying. We want to get married. Go on. He was there for me at the right time, at the right moment. I've been traveling the world the past year. Jumped out of planes, swam with sharks. Ultimately I'm alone. It's been a long time. He makes me feel. He makes me feel. Okay. I'll give you the money. Hello? No, no, no, don't worry about it. No, it's okay. No, I'll call you right back. Here you go. Count it to be sure. Where's GG? She's on the phone outside. You come over less and less. I don't see you enough. You know I don't like seeing you like this. It's God's will. He has a plan. It's not God's will mom. You can have the fucking operation. You so goddamn stubborn. It's so fucking superstitious. Missus Smith had the same eye operatio She died soon after that. Don't you want to be able to see me again? Or anybody, don't you want to be able to see GG? I can still see you. I really can. I see your wrinkles in your forehead. I see the U shape of your mouth. I'm wearing lipstick, and I have makeu No, you're not. Just eye makeup. Mom, I'm gonna bring you back somethin It's a new drug from the black market. Listen, I can treat you. Please don't. I don't want it. Did you ever look to God for help with your ordeal? You cannot enter his kingdom if you kill yourself, right? No. I gotta go, mom. GB. Do you ever think about death? Every day. I think people block it out, but she'll come. She? She sounds better, doesn't it? She would be more forgiving. I don't know. I like Robert Redford as death. Yeah, Twilight Zone. I don't think he's your type. No? Maybe you're right. It's him. Not even here yet. That guy's got the worst timing. Might as well take a look around. Tell me your thoughts. Religion and indoctrination. Maybe he's just insane. No, not this guy. No, he's not insane. On account of everything is so dark, like everything's just fucking falling apart. It's like his world is in the hell, like literally. And? This guy wants to believe in God, or he stopped believing. Now he thinks he might go to hell. If he didn't believe in God, he wouldn't believe in hell at either. But he had guilt. That's all his guilt. Just because you have like different opinions, people will persecute you, just like in the old days. Just like the crusades. It's still like that. Yeah. Oh it's Dali. He's my favorite. He has a piece called, Woman at the Window, and it's, the colors, it's blue, it's green, and it feels alive, and it just takes you there. I stood in front of it for an hour, and then I came back for it again. I was completely obsessed, and I would stand there and just daydream and imagine that she'd be waiti for lover's ship to come. And then I thought no, that's too obviou What if he was watching her the same way you're looking at a paintin and she knew it, and she would pretend like she didn't know, and that's how she would hook her man. And then she would turn around, and I would see her beautiful face, and her eyes would be calm and filled with contentment and acceptance and bliss. What do you think happens when we die? I think when we die, that's it. The time that we have is what we have. I think I'm gonna make the best of it. Yo! You guys ready to do some drugs or what? Yeah. Yeah, I got it. Let's go talk over there. Okay. Come on. How long know that guy for? Not too long, actually we just met like, tonight. - Wow. - Yeah. Okay. All right. You guys ready to do this? Yeah. No bullshit. Okay. Here's the address, burn it when you get there. Listen to me. You gotta be on this guy's level. What does that mean? What does that mean, this guy? What it means is, if he doesn't like you he's not gonna sell to you. And brother, if he doesn't trust you, he will fucking kill you. Honey, I'm sorry, earlier, I didn't realize who you were. Would you mind? No, it's okay. Just a quick? You're so sweet, thank you. It's an honor. Thanks. Wow, all right. Be cool. What? What? He was draped all over you. Oh he was not. Why? Are you jealous? Yeah. Give it up. You can have whatever you want, man. We're cool. Give me your fucking suggestives. We don't have suggestives. GG. GG. Crazy bitch. What the fuck is wrong with you? Okay. Now just stay in the car please? Don't open the doors for anybody, okay? Nobody. Okay. What are you doing? I'm coming with you. No! You don't trust me after everything. No, yes, no, no. Listen, I appreciate you, but you're so- - So, so what? I have to pee. Oh, okay. Go in the bushes, I'll look out for you. What kind of a girl do you think I am? GG, now isn't the time to be difficult I have to pee! Okay, fine! Hello? Greetings. Hi. Want to party? My girlfriend has to pee. Do you mind if she uses the bathroom? But of course. Hey, I'm GG. Hi GG, I'm Leif. Welcome. Come on up. The bathroom's on your right. Would you like a cocktail? 302? Yes. That's my kind of girl, get up here. Leif Strong. Citizens of the Universe, Leif Strong. I didn't even recognize you without your beard. You're awesome. Thank you. I love conspiracy theories. Do you love the word theory? See that? The signature line on every bank issued personal check has writing so small, it's not visible to the human eye. What? That's what they mean when they say, read the fine print before signing anything. You've seen the owl on the dollar bill? Yeah, it's in the corner, right? There's pyramids in China. Yeah, much bigger than the ones in Giza. And you know what they found inside? 10-foot-tall mummies with red hair. Hello Norscot's calling. The government freaked out. They covered it with dirt. Now it's just a giant mountain. Discovery of the century, right? Oh no, they found another one. At the bottom of the ocean in Puerto Rico, oh shit! It gets better. Mars. Damn. Did we go to the moon. Yeah, but not by Apollo. They're masking the truth with yet another lie, those idiots. Can you believe there are still people that think the Earth is flat? But why would governments go to such lengths to cover this up? All done? Shut up Scully. The truth is in plain sight. You just need to learn how to read the symbols. The Gods never left. We are all of stock. You know, people see aliens and UFOs all over the US all the time, and they act like they don't exist. Right. The fact that we exist, why can't others exist? But do we really exist? Are we not holograms? Every portion of the universe carries a semblance of the whole, like William Blake said, you can find the universe in a grain of sand. Bravo, bravo, GG, a holographic universe. Your girlfriend rocks. She's not my girlfriend. You said she was. No. She's a. She's the love of my life. Thank you for that suggestion, GG. Speaking of suggestions, have you got the money? I do. We're all gods. You'll see. You'll see. Did I pass his psychic test? There's no test. We work pretty well together. Look, you're pretty charming but you shouldn't be here. How many more parties do we have to go to? After this, suggestives are the party. Listen, I really appreciate you, and now he'll set up a change in the bathtub, but it's still very dangerous. Leif seems pretty harmless to me. I can't find my phone. You want us to call you? You know that saying, your life is flashing before your eyes? Yeah well, that's when the brain knows it's gonna die. You know what it does? It's just reevaluating itself, you know, it's flashing all of your memories in your whole life. And so any time I want to remember something like, where did I put my fucking phone? I just put this gun in my mouth and I really pretend. I put it in my back pocket. The idiot. Here you go. We gotta go. Oh wait, one more thing. Mandela will affect the world on champions. Right. It's been a pleasure, yeah. Yeah baby, yeah it's the desert baby. The desert baby. I feel like dancing. Oh my God, everybody's talking about the secret show. We should go there tonight. Okay, let's go. I guess we're early. What is this place called? Like the Hidden Gem. It's called the Hidden Gem. Should we just um? You want to get out of here? I'm so sorry. I'll be right back. He put this together, he'll know what's going on. Hey, hey. Hey. I guess we're early. You know, I was gonna surprise you. I didn't know you knew. What? You're here with SIN5. Who? You, you're with SIN5. You're with her, right? I'm so excited for the unveiling of SIN5 tonight. I can't wait to see what they look like. Wow, great jacket. Thank you. So you came with GB, right? - She's SIN5. - She's SIN5? She's SIN5. It's been a while since he's brought somebody around, since Angie. He told you about his ex, right? Yeah, of course. He's been so open about her suicide. I think it's part of his healing process but it's great he's moving on. Yeah. We need to talk. Yeah, we do. You want to go first? Yeah, I actually do. So when were you gonna tell me? Tell you what? That you're freaking SIN5. I was making it up as I went along. That's the first honest thing you've said all night then. You're a pretty damn good actress, you know that? You even sold it to my mom. I wasn't lying. So what were you gonna do? Just like, bye GB. See you later GB. - Was that it? - No. - It was just. - What? - I was just. - What? I was in the moment, and I just wanted to be with somebody real and, and you know, who the fuck knows what's gonna happen to my career. And why is that so bad? You're right, we never promised anythi to each other, right? I never judged you. Why do you get off judging me? It's this night. It's been crazy. It's squashed. Okay? It's squashed. I didn't mean any of that. I'm sorry. Don't do that again. It's your turn. Lately I've been thinking about bucket lists. Why do you wait to do them until you're old? I want to do it all, tonight. What does it matter? We're not gonna see each other again after tonight. I mean you'll probably go on tour for like the next 10 years. I wasn't kidding earlier. I dare you to marry me. I'm not going to Vegas. I know you, you're just like me. You don't want to live a normal life, you want to be free. If we have the potential to love each other, and if we can feel yes, then we're married. You just want to go through the motion but without the end result. If we love each other, then it's real. We're never going to see each other again. Not until we're married. I need a ring. Do you need anything? I'll let you figure that one out. Right. Something has to happen first. What a gorgeous view. I don't know what to say. Anything is possible with you. I wouldn't want to change anything about tonight. I wouldn't want to change anything about you. If I can do it all over again, I wouldn't change a fucking thing. I understand if we'd never see each other again. So I wouldn't bottle everything up. I just to freeze everything in time, because it's you. I knew it from when I saw you. I will cherish the moments that we had. I heard you say yes. I mean who cares if we don't know what they look like? Maybe the mystery just adds to the art. This is the SIN5. - Excuse me. - What? I thought you liked SIN5. Yeah. That's our song. It was? What? What? Special occasions. Will you please stop, will you just talk to me for a sec? Nice pool. Where are you going? It's December. Look, it's really cold, can we just go inside? What are you doing? Why are you taking off your coat for? What's going on? Will you just talk to me? Look, I'm sorry. Whatever it is, I'm really, really sorry Prove to me that I didn't make a mistake. What the fuck? I hate you. I hate you too. Uh, really? I just put it on and then. I'm gonna go and fix a us suggestives. No talking. I get to be the judge. Drink. So, what do you want to suggest? To be. Yeah? Let's be stardust. Are you sure I can keep your clothes? They're something to remember me by so you won't forget. My ride is gonna be here, soon. You're so beautiful, I was thinking that, I wish I could take back my dare. You can't change the rules on me, that's not fair. We never talked about the goodbye part That's easy. I'm gonna hold you, and then I'm gonna kiss you, and I'm gonna say goodbye. And let me be who I am. And I love you. It's okay. You don't have to take back. Why are you taking fentanyl? I need you to tell me, why you are taking fentanyl. Only if you had pancreatic cancer you would take this stuff. I have one month. We have suggestives. It can cure you. We'll get more. No it can't. We just had cosmic fucking sex. What do you mean it can't? I leave on my own terms. What are you gonna do, you're gonna party yourself to death? It's my choice. Don't you have a family? What about your fans? You have no idea how to breaks you dow None. Yes I do. GB, you're scaring me. No. We manifested each other, so you have to see it through. No, GB. You said you loved me. Did it. GB, the pills. The pills. The pills. No no no. I'll shave my legs for you every night. I love you, I'll give my life for you. I will do whatever you want to suggest I didn't know how to tell you. You've taken suggestives before. They can't fix my cancer. We can't end it like this. My whole life has been compromises, and that ends tonight. I'm taking control. GG? We'll start over, okay? My name is Sasha. I just a fucking drug dealer, and I fell for you. I'm so sorry, GG. Sasha? I'm Tasha. I'm the lead singer of SIN5, and I will end my life at the break of dawn on stage at the Hidden Gem. Goodbye, GB. What'd you do? Alex. Drive.
