-Is it true she killed herself? -No. -She was hiding, poor thing. -And she... Anyway, you look like her. Yeah, but... She told me you were peeking. Get lost. JO FOR JONATHAN That's good. It makes you look older. It'll make you look older for your exam. The trick is to make it look like you know what you're doing. You gotta relax. If something happens and you look calm, that's good. Yeah. They basically give the license to people who look in control of the situation. If you look like you know what you're doing, they'll give you your license, no worries. What would you know? Didn't I get my driver's license on the first try? You have to act like you've been driving for 10 years. So how does it look? Stop moving. You're too young. Don't even think about it. Thank you. Thank you. I read the other day that 80% of bills in the U.S. had cocaine powder on them. Yeah, right! Crazy. Everybody's high in the U.S. Number one in the world. Canada is second. Fucking Canadians are always second. Another bill with blow on it. It's good. My brother can make money fly. -Show them! -No. -Come on, show them. -Come on! OK. Check this out. Just watch. How'd you do that? It just takes practice. That's so hot! No way. Crazy! Fuck! Amazing. Fuck. Look at this. Slow down, you're going too fast. OK, turn right. Go in the parking lot. We're going to stop there. I'm sorry, but I can't let you pass. You drove 70 in a 40 zone. Drivers are responsible for their own lives, and everyone else's as well. I know. You don't seem to know. You drive like you're in a video game. Fuck! Calm down. So? Did you get it? So? Don't tell me you failed. Come on. Of course not, it was easy. Man, I swear, all you need is a car and you'll finally pick up chicks. Too bad you won't drive tonight. I'm taking Mom's car. How come? It's my night. I just got my license. I should be able to use the car. Take your own, for fuck's sake! I don't want some junkie at the fireworks scratching my car. Sure. And it's OK if my car gets scratched. Your car is old and ugly. If someone scratches it, you won't even notice. Put some gas in it. You're trying to take advantage of your own son? Yes. You're not invited tonight, I don't think you're old enough. Right. I don't give a fuck. Guys! Hey, what's up? What are you doing? I'll pick you up later. With my brother's car. Don't worry. It'll be fine. All right? I'll come by to pick you up. Mom, I'm going to Sam's. -OK, have a good night. -You too. -You should. -What? Race. OK. Pick a car. -OK, that one. -OK. Let's go for one. You want to race me? All right, you know the drill. To the end of the road. If we tie, we start again. -Fine. -Fine. -That's not yours. -It is. -That's not yours. -I just told you it is. How much do you want bet? $200? $300? It's a bit much, no? You can ask the others, but they all bet the same as me. OK, $200 then. $200? You might as well give it to me now. Very funny. Let's go. -200 bucks? -Yeah. Shit! I don't have much on me. I've got $40, maybe. How much do you have? I don't know, about 65. OK, let's get out of here. OK, give me the cash. You pay now. You know the drill. Don't tell me you don't have it. Mom's sleeping? Jo, I'm talking to you! Nothing. So? The fireworks? Who gives a fuck about fireworks? I'm freaking out. Why? Alexandra. All the guys are looking at her. All the guys have a hard-on for her. You have no idea how much it pisses me off. Just a question of time before I lose her. You're not going to lose her. Thomas! Someone's touching your car! YOU'RE DEAD -Oh fuck! -What? Fuck! -What the hell is that about? -I don't know. Fuck! Asshole! I swear, you touch my car again, I'll break your legs! Get up. Get up. I don't care where you get the money. I don't give a fuck how you get it. You're going to pay for the paint! Tell me what happened and who the fucker is who wrote on my car. What's wrong? Why did you want to see me? You fucking know why I want to see you. No clue. Why did you write that on my car? I don't know what you're talking about. But the little fucker by you owes me money. That "little fucker" is my brother. Yeah, well, your brother owes me $200. Oh yeah? What car did he race with? Don't remember. You got a short fucking memory. I'll make a deal with you. Double or even. Deal? OK. Are you scared? -Are you sure you want to do this? -Yeah. It's easy. You create a diversion, and I'll take care of the rest. I don't know about this. Don't know about you, but I don't feel like doing dishes in a restaurant. Come on! Fuck! Fuck! Take the cards. Take that. Fuck! There's quite a bit. -Really? -Yeah. Isn't it dangerous? No, it's just pepper spray. Maybe we fucked up his eyes. No way. Try it. You'll see it's not that bad. Yeah. Try it. -Are you scared? -You're crazy! I'm not trying that. I'd do it. For real? I'm ready. Come on. Spray it in my eyes. You want me to... -Yeah. -You're sure? Yeah. I can't do it. Do it! -In your eyes? -Yeah. Are you OK? Shit! Are you OK? Yeah. OK, come here. It's your turn. Are you crazy? You should see your face! I got money for you. Give it to me. -I like the glasses. -Why are you wearing glasses? Why are you wearing glasses? -I'm tanning. -Dumbass. There's no sun today. Exactly. That way, I won't get cancer. -Still some money missing. -I'll give you the rest next week. OK. -You don't care, do you? -Yeah, I do. You know, Jo, we fool around, it's fun and all, but... when you do stuff like that, I'm not proud of you. You have everything going for you. You're smarter, better looking than me. -I'm not better looking than you. -That's not the point. Make your own life. Do your thing. Stop trying to be me. My life basically boils down to a shitty job, lousy pay. I get a new steering wheel and I get all excited. Yeah. Do your own thing. I have a nice car at least. That's about all. You have a hot girlfriend too. Yeah. Don't go near her, asshole. Give me your cell to call mine. I lost it. Maybe it's in your car. Fuck. Let's see. Fuck! Do you race often? From time to time. Do you win often? I lost... Fuck! I lost one or two. Out of how many? Why? Do you want to race instead of me? I'll look for my cell. Change the bulb. Hi. At what time? Are you staying home? OK, I'll come by later. I don't know, later. I love you. You know that? OK, bye. -What are you doing? -I'm coming. OK, we take off on "go"! -Is that OK? -All right! Three! Two! One! Go! I looked at my brother. He was tense that day. I was sitting there and it felt like... Everything was in slow motion. The farther the car went, the deeper I sank. It was like I was floating. I heard a noise. I don't think it came from outside. It came from inside my head. After that, there was silence. It feels like it lasted an hour. But it was only a second. I was breathing slowly. It's all I could hear. I didn't open my eyes. It was warm. I was feeling good. I felt so good. It was pouring in my face. So I was certain then. I knew I was going to die there. I didn't know if I was dead or alive. I couldn't feel anything. I didn't feel a thing, I swear. I thought to myself: "Let yourself go. "Pretend you're asleep. "As if it's not really happening." You didn't get scared? No. No, I was somewhere else. It wasn't fear. What was it then? It was as if time had just stood still. Like when you hold your breath. After that, how did you get out? I blacked out. I can't remember anything. That's fucked up. You didn't get hurt? -Anywhere? -No. It's like nothing can hurt me. I feel invincible. Come here. No! No! Stop! What are you doing? I'm going to go see my brother. Are you sure you're going to be OK? I'll be fine. All right. -Take care. -Yeah. KILL ME What are you doing here? Turn the music off. Your brother wrote that? What are you going to do? What do you mean? Are you going to leave him? You can't stay with a guy like that. He's disfigured. What are you going to do? Leave. I didn't ask you to come here. Continue after the stop sign. You're doing really good. You have a perfect score so far. Go into the parking lot, then turn left. OK, stop here. One last thing before we go back. Back up and do a 90-degree turn. You can go. I try to imagine his life. I don't know how he's going to make it. I feel like I'm the one who's burned. I would have preferred that it happened to me. No. It's not your fault. I don't know how he's going to make it. I feel so guilty. Oh, God! Subtitling: Hiventy
