Adi... Where are you? Hey Adi! Where did he- Told him to lay off it today. I'll need to carry him... That's from last night. Let's go. How are you? - I'm fine. I'm coming. Thank you, thank you. Slow down! What are you doing? Siraj! Dad! Sorry, I didn't want to say it. Get some water please... ONLY FOR YOU The city scape does not compare to her lips, I don't know her name, But she's on my mind, And now it's raining at the oddest hour, God you have left me in a fix, She doesn't kiss, or hug, She just hits! She looks like a Bul Bul bird, And she has soared to me, She looks like a Bul Bul bird, And her cunning has trapped me, She thinks she's Queen Victoria, So what am I to do? She has spun me like a top, She is a strange little bird. He looks like a boar, And he has walked to me, He is handsome, but isn't that smart, and now I'm stuck. I have fallen in to a coffin, I have been burnt to ashes, But he still hasn't left, It is very strange. What happened? Howcome you've rejoined so soon? My friends first ever wedding night! We've been planning this since class 5- Nothing happened. What? Didn't you try first base? Where's your sindoor? - Washed it off while bathing. Tell me how it was? How was what? - Did nothing happen? I have such dreams about that night... A full moon... Shut up! Yesterday was a new moon. - Let's see what happens next full moon. Chandu, please promise me that you'll never get married. Shut up! That's what they all say. - Listen up... People! Priests and those who are their wives cattle... Those who have been oppressed by their wives... Tortured, insulted and humiliated, Even thrown out of their own houses! How many of you have come here to find shelter? We have! If you are by my side! If you are by my side, I am happy! And I am forgetting myself! When you look at me, I bounce, I am dancing all about the town! I don't want this day to end, Or this night aswell, I want you to wrap me like an envelope, I am drowning in your trance... When you are by my side, I am happy! And I forget myself! Who is the superstar? Which prince of Ghatal? Is he a Member of Parliament? Who can do what he wishes? Let's see his guts! And his tail! If in 5 minutes the lights don't go off and the sound does not reduce... One of us is going to be gone! Sleep! He isn't ready to understand me... I'm stubborn, I won't let go... He just doesn't listen... Hi. Good morning. Hello! Hey! Nayan, what's the matter? Why did you call last night and keep screaming? If you have to spend the night with an angry drunk... But, he's your husband. Thanks for reminding me. Nayan, you are overreacting. Marriage is about give and take... Adjusting... This isn't a marriage. This is Hell! Hell! Nayan, what are you saying? You've just got married. How will you live together your entire life? Thinking about getting a divorce? No Reesree, this marriage is for my father. So I won't end it. He's had a heart attack once before, if he has another... Sree, please help me. Yes, Sree? Just spoke to boss about your transfer. I can't stay here anymore. Please talk to him. I'll go anywhere. U.S, U.P., Uganda... I will go! She looks like a Bul Bul bird, And she has soared to me, She looks like a Bul Bul bird, And her cunning has trapped me, She thinks she's Queen Victoria, So what am I to do? She has spun me like a top, She is a strange little bird. He looks like a boar, And he has walked to me, Walking is good for health. If you are in the dark you shall never fear death. Watchman! He isn't ready to understand me... He isn't ready to understand me... I'm stubborn, I won't let go... He just doesn't listen... She thinks she's Queen Victoria, So what am I to do? She has spun me like a top, She is a strange little bird. Mrs. Sen there have been many complaints about your husband. I have nothing to say. Talk to her. Where are you going? See what your husband is doing... Shut up! What does he think of himself? My dog shits on the road. Your husband puked on my doorstep. I am calling the cops! Enough is enough! Your husband asked me for milk in the middle of the night! He wanted to drink some of mine. He asked me if he could play cricket on my pitch. I swear, I'll kill him! He said I don't look like a virgin. He asked me how I had my baby! Imagine! Excuse me? I am talking to you. Are you a dream? - No, a nightmare! Aren't you ashamed of your drunkenness? It's an acquired taste. Aren't you ashamed of staying at a strangers house? You are being terrible to Nayantara. You're torturing her. What do you want? - What do I want? I don't want anything. Yes! I have food. Want some? One minute. Know him? This is Mr.Acid. Just eat and then drink water. Instant acidity. You've come for the first time, so I'm offering. I don't want it! She doesn't want me! No one is responsible for my death. What did you do? You made Mr.Acid commit suicide! You are mad! Should be put in an asyllum! I know what you need. One minute. Oh no! Kick all the doors on the 4th floor. The one which won't open is your flat. I am in front of my house! Do you want to get married? - Yes, do you have a girl? Yes, a half-cute girl. Caucasian? - At night, without your specs she is. Then the morning shall reveal the light. Give her a lot of cake. After all she is a Brit. I had told you not to come! Why did you? Bye! Take this and leave! Get out! Out! Out! I have loved and so I shall, I have loved and so I shall, As our eyes meet... Hello? Did I disturb you? - No, no. Please come in. Thanks. Would you like something? I can't make cold coffee? Nothing. Thanks. I came to invite you to my birthday. You're looking good. When is it? - Next week. Ok. My advance wishes. There is a fielder there... Ok. Get in. - Do I have to go? You have to. This is an emergency case. Tell her to get the injection. Any family members? What's her name? - Her name... Age... She is this tall. - Who are you? Her husband. Hopeless! No point in talking to him. He is dead drunk! Hello, doctor. - Hello. Her name is Nayantara. Age 26. You are her husband and I don't know about your relationship, But if you're living together, you should be aware of her medical history. Merely for the sake of humanity. I've medicated her, please feed her. Thank you. - Welcome. How can he neglect his wife like that? First eat this, then that, followed by the tablet and capsule. I'm not saying it. The doctor did. I'll take time to eat. Go home. You don't need to stay. I'm not going anywhere. The doctor told me to stay. Can I ask you something, if you don't mind? Has this happened before? The doctor wanted to know your medical history. Yes. It had happened once before. When? Siraj... Look where you're going! Want to get me jailed or what? Hey! Won't you apologize? Uncouth! I won't! - Pig! Nayan, calm down. Would the public have spared us if you died? Blind or what? Has she bought me or the car? Here we go. Yes! Siraj Chowdhury. You're a topper? Yes, sir. - You're admission is 100% guaranteed. Fees are Rs.3,40,000 One minute, sir. Next! Tell me, son. Dad, I'll get admission for sure. - God is Gracious. This is his blessing. But... I need some money. How much? - Rs.3,40,000 I know that everything has been mortgaged since Sister's wedding. And you had said that you can't afford my education. But I've worked hard! I've worked as labour, as a tutor... I want to study. I'll get a good job and earn money. Please let me study here. Please... Sorry, I overheard your conversation. My father is the president of the college. I could help you. Don't mistake my tears for weakness. You may have a big car and a president as a father, but though I'm poor I have something. My marks and my self-respect. If I needed pity I would have stopped studying long back. So please don't pity me. Only one being may do that - The Holy One. A fancy car doesn't allow you to play God. Showing me pity... Hey! Nayan! What are you doing here? Your admission is fixed. - Dad! What? - Give me a moment. You need to do something. Our entrance topper doesn't have money for fees. But we don't provide scholarships. You can start from today. Siraj Chowdhury! Who is Siraj Chowdhury? Who is Siraj Chowdhury? - I am. The principal is calling you to talk about admission. Thank you God! Next class is Economics. What are you doing? You? - You? Oh! Forgot this was your father's college. I got in on merit! I don't take pity. And you? I was the topper. So I got a scholarship. We don't have scholarships. I'm a special case. The college didn't want to lose me. I am the beacon of the institution. Such pride! If this is what a few marks does, then you can't be the pride of the college. Atleast I don't think that money and power makes me God... Let's go. Excuse me. You will know the true dispenser of your destiny soon enough. Then you will eat your words. Let's go! Bye! What news? Why is your mood off? Dad, have we started a scholarship? I know why you're asking. So let me tell you... I was the board exam topper, and had gone for admission. I had no money. So I couldn't get in. Then a girl as pretty as you told me that she'd arrange the money. I vented my frustration on the girl! She cried all the way home. The day after that I got a scholarship letter. Later I found out that she had arranged it all. Dad? - Yes, dear. You never met her after that? That girl was your mother. There's a saying which goes "History repeats itself." "History repeats itself." The same... Hello! Wake up! Siraj, get up... Sir is calling you. - Give me some tea with extra sugar. Hey! Listen! Give me Siraj's number. 8796205301 Can I go? - Don't you dare tell Siraj. I forget everything. But call him at night. He gets lonely at the station. Station? - He has no money to rent a house. Let's not talk today, Let's hide our pain in the flickering flame, Today tell me, For I cannot close my eyes. My heart tells me to reach out to you... As these heart wrenching evenings engulf me. All that separates us, Is our pride. All that separates us, Is our pride. Listen up! Come here. Oh my! Tell me. I have found a place for Siraj. Take him there. But if he finds out, he'll be furious. Do you want him to die on the road? - No, I want him to live in a house. I want him to settle down... He has refused to stay at my place! He has a shop full of pride! - I'll shoot his pride! I'll get him! - Good boy! Where are you taking me? - Somewhere nice. Be careful. - Is it raining? This house? - Ya. Are you mad? - Where are you going? Know how much it'll cost! My baby! He's looking for a place to stay. - Of course. Just like my baby! Please come in... - Ok, ok... You can come too. Please come in. My son Kurtush. Went to study abroad and stayed there. Hasn't come back. He never will. This room and everything in it is yours. And in this cupboard... - There's something strange... Let's go! Shut up! - Let's see this shirt on you. Perfect! Exactly Kurthush's size. Everything in the cupboard is yours. All the clothes. And tell me what you'd like to eat. I'll cook it. Will you stay? - Yes, but... the rent? Can't ask my son for rent. Please do come. I'll be waiting. You're very lucky. God has given you a mother too. Aunty, you were amazing! - Be careful. I may fall! Your performance brought tears to my eyes. You'll know when you're a mother, that none of it was an act. But are you in love with him? Of course. Because "History repeats itself." The probability of an event is determined by studying the sample space... The 4 Vedas: Rig Veda... Today we will try to find out the mean, median and mode... And Athurva Veda. Whose phone is that? Who is it? A phone call in class! Mean as we all know... Get out! - Sorry ma'am. Get out! Is x1 + x2 + x3... Phone in class? Out! Been seeing this for 10 years! Hey! Silence! Hello? - I got a call from this number. You've called me. - But you called first. But you've called. - But you called first! I got kicked out of class because of your call. Class? Do you study in school? Do all kids have phones nowadays? - Have you called to kid around? Don't get angry! Do you wear shorts or trousers to school? Don't joke! I got kicked out of class because of you! But you only sleep in class. Give me a cup of tea! Hey! Who are you? You've called, so who are you? No! You called first! Tell me your name! - You first! You first! - No, you... You... - No, you... You? - You? So, this was your doing? Giving me missed calls! This is too much! You called first. Just tell me that you like me. No need for missed calls! Am I that bad looking? - You... You like someone else? - I don't like anyone! Not even me? - Never thought about it. Think about it. I'll be waiting for you at the church nearby at 4PM. Think. Coz I want an answer. Or else I will tell the principal about the call. Close your eyes and think. - I will! Should I open my eyes now? On that side is heart ache, And that's what pushes me to you, So come and visit me in the corners of this town, Your lonely heart should search for another, I am sliding into darkness, Please light the way... All that separates us, Is our pride... All that separates us, Is our pride... A big car doesn't make you God. You'll find out who God is later... And then you'll regret it! I told you that Siraj would find out! He's going home. You told him? - Why should I? I had warned you... Siraj, are you leaving? You proved that you are the Dispenser of my Destiny. You've proved that the president's daughter with her big car is the real God. Did you do all of this to demean me? You've won... So I'm leaving. I didn't do anything! I want you be the topper in college. I'm ready to do anything for that. I want you to make it so big that my assistance is overlooked. And only your success is seen. I love you Siraj. I love you... All that separates us, Is our pride. All that separates us, Is our pride. Do you believe that I never wanted to demean you? You have taken over the landscape of my heart. So you know everything... What now? Will you marry me? I will. But the situation at home isn't good. Abbu can't work and I'm studying. I've got to get my sister's married and get Dad treated. I'm getting a job. - Won't you study anymore? An oil company in Kuwait said that they will pay me well. They'll train me for 2 months. And then? What else? I'll have to work there. Please hide me in the land of clouds... Please fix my broken heart... Tell your Dad about our wedding and- - Nayan, you're a Hindu and I'm a Muslim. Oh really? Thanks for the info. - It's not a joke. You don't know my father. He'll never accept us. Please hide me in the land of clouds... If no one agrees to our marriage, If no one accepts us... Please fix my broken heart... Your lonely heart should search for another, I am sliding into darkness, Please light the way... All that separates us, Is our pride... All that separates us, Is our pride... Here you go. Got married yet? - Dad! The beer means that you have some news. - Tell me? You've found a groom. Correct? He's very nice. Our class topper. He's got a job in Kuwait. Ok! - And I like him. Like him or love him? - Love him. Then it's done! If you love him then so do I. Dad, we're very serious! So am I! But... - But what? His name is Siraj. I see. Where does he live? - In Farakka. Which planet? - Siraj is a human who lives on this planet. Then it's settled. You were talking as if he was from another planet. Tell me what I have to do. You have to explain to his father that I am a human too. Done. Since you have already bribed me, I must deliver. Now, take a sip and don't worry. - Dad! Take it, otherwise... How do you drink it! This is better. Cheers! - Cheers! Since a rich man like you has come to a poor man like me, it must be important. It's a question of my daughter's life... - Your daughter? My daughter Nayantara and your son Siraj. They study in the same college. That's how they became friends. College friends? - Yes. I thought people study there? They both love each other. They are very serious. They want to get married. Married? - Yes. Ok. If you are ready to leave your daughter to us beggars, why should I have a problem? So they've decided... Good. But I have a condition. - Tell me. Your daughter will have to take up Islam. Her name will be Jahanara. In this house we read Namaz 5 times a day. Will Jahanara manage? Or else she can wait till I die. It's time for my Namaz. Salaam. God speed. What'll happen now? - What will? I knew he'd never agree. - Oh God! Why did you do this? - I'm ready to be Jahanara for you. I love Nayantara. Not Jahanara. - What's there in a name? I'm ready to read the Namaz 5 times for you. For me all Gods are the same. The One. - My father is doing this to avoid the subject. If you change religion then he will create an issue out of it. Nayan. Want to get a registry done? Did you meet my Dad on the way? - No. This is your idea? - Yes, it came spontaneously! Are you that brave? Yes, I know you think I'm a coward... Not anymore... Let's go. Some are just wishes, That shall never be fulfilled, Take me with you today... Take me forward, A step or two... I want to walk along with you... Whose story is this, Who is writing it? Who is moving out of the dark in to the light? Whose story is this, Who is writing it? Who is moving out of the dark in to the light? Some are just wishes, That shall never be fulfilled, Take me with you today... Take me forward, A step or two... I want to walk along with you... Why so early? The registrar will come at 10. It's only 7. There's a slot from 10 to 12 then from 2 to 4. Are you alone? - No, he'll be here any moment. Don't stand. Sit on the bench on that side. In my ups and downs, All I do is look for you... In stormy weather, If you find the time, I want to tell you how I feel... Some are just wishes, That shall never be fulfilled, Take me with you today... Take me forward, A step or two... I want to walk along with you... Oh my! I completely forgot about you. Has your husband not arrived? Oh my! This does happen. I've seen it many a time. Does your family know? Don't worry. This is not the end of life. No one keeps their word any longer. Let your parents decide who you should marry. You'll be happy. For today, get home early. What's the matter, darling? Amit told me that my daughter was standing in front of the registry office. And I was waiting for my daughter to come home with her husband. Let's go... What happened? - Sorry, Dad. Sorry. For what? - You gave me the idea and I didn't tell... What would be the fun if you told me? Come on, come on. Let's go. Let's go on a long drive. Who do you want? - Where's Siraj? Who are you? - Where is Siraj? Siraj! Shouting won't bring him back here. He left. Don't play tricks with me. I'm not in the mood. What's the point in tricking you. I have an early day. Please leave. Siraj! - Taking advantage of an old man? Enquire at the airport as to whether Siraj Chowdhury has boarded a plane to Kuwait. If not, you can search. But please let me sleep now. Can't miss the first Azaan. Siraj has fallen in love with a Hindu girl so I must pray for him. He is the only hope. As he has now gone abroad. God speed! Siraj! Get up... What happened? Kuwait is on this planet. I shall go to find your boyfriend. Why are you crying? Don't cry... Dad, that man is lying. - Yes, he is. He knows where Siraj is... Siraj would never abandon me... That man is lying... Ok, let me see... Dad... Hello, Chatterjee? Are you at the airport? I need some help. Some information. Could you tell me if Siraj Chowdhury has caught a flight to Kuwait today? It's a little urgent... Thank you. What did he say? - What else? I know he hasn't left. - Siraj will never leave me... I'm just afraid of one thing. His father. What do you mean? Is he a child? Stop crying right now! Nayan, stop it. When your mother left, I held back my tears but your tears... Please stop... Hello! Yes, yes. Dad? Siraj hasn't gone... - Thank you. What did he say? Please tell me that Siraj hasn't left... Siraj has gone to Kuwait. He has left you. Forget him. Erase him from your life. Dad? What's wrong? Is anyone there? Please help! He is out of danger. But you must be careful. A cardiac attack takes 5 days to stabilise. Please don't stress yourself. Receive the phone outside. He needs rest. Peace of mind. Peace of mind and ear. I'm so sorry. - It's ok. Hello? - Nayantara? It's me, Bhaba. Any news on Siraj. - I got a call form Kuwait. There was an accident at the petroleum plant. Siraj is no more. Hello? Please repeat what you said. There was an accident at the petroleum plant. Siraj is gone. Siraj is gone. Dad? You're totally unkempt. I don't like it. I don't like seeing you sad either. Have you seen yourself? Have I said anything? I'm going to my room. - Listen! Speak clearly. The same old thing that all fathers tell their daughters. See you. I need to talk to you. Sit down. Now, tell me. I want you to get married. Start a family. Live happily. That's all. Ok. I agree. I'll get married. Now please shave. Please. My darling doesn't look nice like this. Is it possible for a girl to love a boy that much? That's true love. I need to leave. I have office. I'll come back soon. - No! No need. I'll call a friend. So then I'll call. In case you need something. Ok? You take care of yourself. Bye. I... don't have your number. Could you give it to me? 9830087710 Hello? - How are you? Who is this? - Adi... What happened? - Nothing... Have you had your medicine? Yes, I have. - Ok. Had called to find out. Take care Let's go. Wow! You look... Have you got rid of your wife? Don't talk shit. - Where are you going? This isn't the way to office. Today's a holiday for me and you. I've told boss. Are you serious? Let's get some juice. - Juice? Thank you, Chandu. Hello? - Have they given you juice? No. - Should I get some? No need. They will give me some. - Ok. Take care. Tell me what's happening. It's a jaundice case. - She has jaundice? No! - Then? Heartbreak. - Heartbreak? I hate hospitals - What's this? I would have come if you had called. What's the bill? - Rs.80,650 Card or cash? Cash. - Card. Card. Please stop it! Cash. You'll just swipe a strangers card? - No, I mean... Cash! - I thought he was your husband... You thinking it, doesn't make it real. - But he signed all... Signing makes one a husband? - Sorry. Couldn't I have paid? Why should you? You can't! Why did you keep calling. Why the sudden care? Trying to be responsible? Who asked you to call? You gave me your number. - So? I was depressed. So I gave it to you. Why do you have to call? Don't try to make it mean something. Even my watchman has my number. Should he pay the bill? Am I the same as the watchman? The watchman is better. He understands his job well. Now listen carefully... From now on if you try to show me care or pity, I will finish you! Don't forget it! Sree, pay the bill. Do you remember when you first cried? Why are you talking rubbish? Don't piss me off. Do you remember when you first cried? Don't irritate me. Let me drink in peace. Drink. Drink up! Cheers! She has a lot of pain inside her. No one knows what she's going through, except me. Will you take me to her? I really... - What? Tell me. Say? I really... Adi... Hey Adi! The first day you cried, I could do nothing. But today I can. And I will! Get up Adi! Get up! Do you know about the first time Adi cried? Shut up! This is a respectable place. - I know! I know it is. But do you know where your husband is? You don't care coz you don't know when he first cried. Cut the drama and say it fast. He cried when he first fell in love. - What? 2006... Little Monta, did you hit Chandan? He called the girls in my locality frogs. Girls and boys will play games. It keeps them fit in body and mind. Swami Vivekananda said this. Do you know that? No. If you have it on your phone, then play it. But we should keep the games confined to our own localities. Today both localities will play. Just try and stop it. Need to 'Bang Cock' Small Monta's locality today. So start! Quack! Quack! Shouldn't we play a match? Small Monta, let's play. - Quack! Never fight for yourself. Only fight for friends. And if you get hit, do it only for yourself. Keep that in mind. Hey! Giri go and find Gauri, She must be a very... Stop singing! Give me money for groceries. Money? Get a money plant. Tear the leaves and spend. When you come to eat, I'll shove salt down your throat! Who's eating your food. Nothing but boiled beans! That's what you'll get! Give it tome, Oh Kali... Please do give. - Who's that? Oh Kali! Why are you standing like a pillar? You want money, don't you? Need to donate to the temple for blessings to pass my exam. Exam! You'll never pass! Uncle, give me money. - I'll give you a slap! Don't get angry. - Acting smart with me? Haven't brushed, so a lot of rubbish is coming out. Here. Wait! You have to do something important! Tell me. - You need to pick up a cheque for me. It's a very large amount. So be careful. It is my capital. Go to Chapal Babu at 10:30AM and- I'll remember. - That's your commission. Oh yes! Do you know where he lives? - Of course there is only one Chapal in the locality. Move! I'm leaving! Need to meet Ma Lakshmi! See you... Good morning, Uncle Kongsho. Oh there he is! My Nimai of the seas! Nimai, I've given my useless nephew an important responsibility. Please go with him. It'll give me confidence. Oh! This love! Am I useless. - No, you're invisible! Thank you. - Just shut up and help me push this thing. Let's do some social service. Sit. It's a lot of money! First day, first show for Phatakeshto. - But first Uncle's cheque. Is Chapal here? - Who are you? Kongsho is my uncle. Don't laugh. Who knew that my uncle would have a nephew when they named him? Sir! - What happened? Krishna is here! - Tell him to play his flute while I bathe. If it gets late, I'll leave. It's my Guru's film. Can't miss it. You must be sensitive to other's pain. If he doesn't clear his stomach in the morning, he'll feel terrible all day. It's horrible! Let's pray for the success of his dump! Come! My heart shakes and jiggles, It beats so fast! We have started losing our way... Ooh La La! I love you my dear! Ooh La La! I My dear! Where's my tea- Where are you going? - Tea... To make tea. - There are people for that. Did it happen? - Yes, peace at last! So tell me Keshta. - Am not Keshta, I'm Chandan, Kongsho's nephew. The cheque? - Here you go. Don't eat it up! - Things people say... 2 Lakhs! Smiling liking a goat! Let's go the movie's started. The movie started a long time back. It's going to be a superhit! Hey! Mithun Da! Mithun Da is killing it! What are you doing? Get him! Kill him! Never let me watch a movie in peace! I won't sit! Any longer! Sit down! Or I'll pound you! What did you say? Insulting my husband! All of you come and see what has happened! What will I do now? What happened? Is your uncle dead? He left the house like a prince! Aunt... Oh it's you! What happened? Go up and see! It's a disaster! Oh my! - Uncle! Let me see. You look like Harbhajan Singh- - Bloody swine! Just one hit? Of course. My name is Kongsho. So my nephew is fated to vanquish me. Does anyone sit in the front row with their second wife? The point is- - Who was sitting in the front row? Don't be shy. Tell her. Me? I was sitting in the first row of the bus. Then there was a bump, and the bus shook and my head hit the roof. You got on to a bus with your scooter? Shut up! Can't you see I'm in pain? Shut up! You can't hide from me! Won't even let me cry in peace! - I'll cut you- Uncle! - Oh my... Goes straight to my head. - It's difficult for an old model to hold 2 sim cards. Don't let her know. Otherwise she'll kill herself. What'll I do then? I have only one wife! You're making me cry! - Bloody swine! If you do not give me money to spend... How shall I keep my mouth shut? Of course. That I know. Here you go Chandu. Spend it all. What are you doing? Am I a freebie? This is my age to spend. And I have to keep my mouth shut too. Of course. You are like my nephew. Spend it all. My money is like bird seed! Just given away! Chandu? - Yes, uncle? My cheque. - Checked the cas. It's fine. Bloody swine! I'm talking about my cheque! You can't expect me to pick up your cheques when you go out on a date! Go and get it yourself! Don't you know how to talk to elders? - Tell me? You should be ashamed! What an amazing uncle! You called him a dog? Uncle, don't worry. I'll pick Chandu up at 7AM. And I will get the cheque myself! Yes, Uncle Kongsho. What's this? I told you I'd be here at 7. Why aren't you ready? I mean... - A promise to Kongsho and Adi's time can never be denied. Let's go! - I'm not wearing underwear. We're going on a bike, not a bus. Ready? - Please be careful. Anybody there? - I'm off for now- Oh wow! A new janitor! Have been waiting for a week! Did you get him? Is he a hard worker? - Totally! They pay well! Take off the lungi and come with me. I told you to let me wear underwear! What will happen? Hold this! Clean up on that side! He is Kongsho's nephew. Krishna? He's not a janitor. - Oh my! Doesn't look like a gentleman for sure. It's coz he's wearing his uncle's lungi. If he takes it off he'll look like a prince. Hey janitor! Shut up! - You shut up! Oh my! You finished brushing so early? Did you come to see her Colgate smile? - Idiot! Thank you. This is your fault! I told you to be ready by 7! - Sorry. Who are you? Who are we? Don't you recognize us? We came to collect the cheque yesterday. And you were dancing. Remember? What's his name? - Chapal Chapal. We met Chapal. I don't know how to dance and Chapal Babu will be back next week. I'm getting late. Cockroach! Hey! Listen! Let it be. I'd like your name and phone number. Just to check up on you, once in a while. Brother, I have a boyfriend. Fit and fine. I know you're trying. But it's useless. But is that reason enough to call me brother? Don't be sad, brother. Siblilings should never lie to each other. Excuse me Brother 3. Please take Brother 2 and leave. Brother 2, it's time to go! Anyway, your name and number- - Leave! Only the name? - Please go. Just the number? - Get out! Let's go! - Shut up! Trust me, it was torture. And I'm late for office... Look at that! Wow! How handsome! Hi! Why are you waving? Are you following me? What's your name? - What? Name! Your name? Get lost! He's mad! Let's go. We're late. Hello, madam. Why are you here? - Could I know your name? My- No need for a name. Where's the cheque? First, get dressed. This is an office area. You'll get the cheque when Chapal Babu returns. Hey Rohan! She called me naked! What's up, we're getting late... - Good morning, so sorry... She'll look back. She will! She- What happened? She didn't turn. - Please take me home. I'm highly ventilated. Hello, Bozo! Give your hand. Handshake? Bozo the vagrant boys are after me. Will you protect me? Thank you. And don't let those boys in to the house. Can I come? I need to win the dogs heart in order to win hers. Want a milk biscuit? Please get me in to her heart. Who's there? Bozo! Bozo! Bozo... Tandoori chicken. Want some? Are you vegetarian? Paneer... No problem. Want a hot dog? Hot dog! Bozo! Hot dog! Very hot! You like? Cheque? - Chapal Babu will return next week. Leave! Phone number? What are you doing here? Cheque. - So that's your excuse for following me... I'll follow you all your life. What do you want? My cheque! - What? My cheque! - It's lost! Leave me alone! Ok. My cheque? I'll give it to you tomorrow. You are waiting on the other side of my song My cheque? Were you a street hawker in your last life? Grovelling for a cheque like this? I won't eat it up! I'll give it to you! Now go! Did you get it? - Should get it by next week. You're on a different agenda. - No, I can see... The day is nearing. The day has come, my brother. Hello? Hello? Hi! - Hello? Hi! You're always flirting! Hi! What do you want? You've been chasing me like a dog! Why are you here? - Came to eat. Don't play games. Think I don't know you? Brother! - Broth... Please don't call me that. It gives me nightmares. Siblings always tell the truth. And I have a boyfriend, brother. Are you tricking me? - Me! Playing tricks? - Yes! With you? Wait I'll fix it. See that handsome man wearing a coat? Rohan, my boyfriend. What? Are you joking? - Me. With you? Yes! - Don't believe me? One minute. Rohan! Hi! What's your name? Adi... Rohan! - Hold for a sec. What? He's Adi, my brother. - Hi Adi. He's Rohan, my boyfriend. Wait, wait. You shouted out the word brother. But why did you whisper the word boyfriend? Culture. Cultured women don't exclaim their boyfriend's name in public. You have no chance. - What if he says no? Koli come fast! We have a meeting in my cabin. One minute. How is he? He's calling me to his cabin. I'll see you later, brother. Koli! Could you give me your number, Koli? I've lost it, Koli. Can I text it to you. - No, you don't have my new number. Please give me your number. - Let's not waste time. Lots of work... Koli, your number please. - Koli's number? Yes, Rohan. - It is 9867476664 I know it by heart. - Thank you, Rohan. Bye. Let's go. - I'll call you at night, Koli. Do receive. What are you thinking about? - I want to start a business. Chandan business? Salt water. When you sweat I'll collect it and transport it via tram. Yes! - What happened? Where were you? - She gave me her number. What? Then why the wait? Time to call! She introduced me to her boyfriend. Rohan. - Family album. But you're a part of the family. You're the sweet brother! Why are you hitting me? Hit Rohan if you have the guts! Oh my friend! My elephant!... Boyfriend. Rohan. - Looks like a thermometer. Come. Oh my Elephant... Adi, he called you an elephant. Elephant? - Yes. What should I do? Turn around and hit him! Hey! What? Did you call me an elephant? - Can't hear you. What? Called me an elephant? - Ha? (yes) Oh my! Touch us and you're dead! Oh my! Get lost! Get lost! Bloody traitors! - You Koli's boy? Calling her to your cabin... Honeymooning early... Such a big job and only 20 rupees in hand? Look at that! He's got another girl's picture. This is his one on the side. Cheating? Wait! He wants to say something. That's better! This is my pregnant wife! Koli is my wife's best friend. She is my sister. My much loved sister. My little sister... Shut up! - He's scary... Nice one! Come on! She's coming. Uncouth barbarian! Beating people up in my name? You idiot! He's my boss! I hate you! I lied coz I don't like you! Before I forget... This is the cheque you wanted? Here you go! If you look at me again I'll gouge your eyes out! What are you doing? This is yours! Uncle! Ever wondered why she carried the cheque around? Why? If she didn't like you she could have given you the cheque long back. Use your head for more than colouring your hair. Use your brains... Listen to the bottle. The bottle... Don't let her go. Ask her all your questions. If you don't get answers, create a ruckus in front of her hosue. Chandu, the bottle is telling me to create a ruckus! Go! Big Fight! - Big Fight! Bozo, tell me something... Why are girls born? To give pain. Bozo! Will you come with me or stay with this drunkard? Come! He has some guts! Bloody monkey! But you 2 are just about the same! The boy who came in the morning lost the cheque. Please give this to him,. And listen, I'll be back in a week. Keep well. Lying lifeless on the floor! Let's go. He drank too much, so he ended up here. Can I take him? Let's go... Listen. tell him to meet me at 5PM. Where? - He knows. Your dog is very sweet... Your willful breeze is a delight... I am now in pieces, And am ready to drown... She seems to be in brother mode today. Maybe even in father mode! I don't want to be an accomplice. I want freedom! I'll be back in a minute. Hey- - Sorry sister. I should have never pursued you, once you said you had a boyfriend. My mistake... I am very sad, sister. Hey! Why are you calling me sister? Why the extra respect? You've been following me around like a watchdog. You beat up an innocent man coz you thought he was my boyfriend! You smile whenever you see me and now I'm a sister! You're no less! You kept the cheque in your bag and spun me like a top. You conned me in to mistaking a friend for your boyfriend. And I'm your brother... If I'm your brother, then you are... I'm Koli. I am your Koli. I bought it myself. - Beer? Your favourite. - Thank you. Cheers! - Cheers! Adi, my granny used to say... That if I lay down on my mother's lap and looked at the sky, my wishes would come true. Have you heard this saying? No. You don't know anything. Adi, if you marry me, who do you need to tell? Dad, Mom and... Chandan. I have no one to call. Because I am the master of my own will. Why? Your mother, father... That would happen if they were there. I'm- - No sympathy please. They died when I was a child. I grew up in an orphanage. Then I moved to my uncle's house. School, college, scholarship... A job. That's how my life has been. I don't think about these things... But I felt like saying them to you today... When those closest to you, leave you alone... The whole world loses colour. It feels like life has stopped... But out of the ashes of life, a ray of hope appears. Then life starts anew. I have said my peace. Have anything to say? I have never slept on my mother's lap. Can I rest on your lap? Some are just wishes, That shall never be fulfilled, Take me with you today... Take me forward, A step or two... Why here? - Today's your birthday. How did you... - Go and take your blessings. God's name on the Devil's lips! Ok. You come along. - No, I won't. Go yourself. Take me forward, A step or two... I want to walk along with you... I'm asking for the last time. Will you come? Whose story is this, Who is writing it? Who is moving out of the dark in to the light? Whose story is this, Who is writing it? Who is moving out of the dark in to the light? Some are just wishes, That shall never be fulfilled, Take me with you today... Take me forward, A step or two... I want to walk along with you... Brother, today is our wedding night. I could have slept with you before we were married. Couldn't I? Today we are married. And with it comes great responsibility. Tonight I shall have a peaceful sleep. My nights were sleepless before. I used to feel that I had no one to love. Is there anyone... - Me! Brother, take your wife on a bike ride tomorrow. She will take care of you. But the new bride must sleep tonight. Good night. Koli! Love you - Love you too. We shall walk the path today, In front of all who stare. And all I feel is you... If the weather turns grey, Adi, ice-cream! What do you want? - Beer. You'll get drunk and ride! I'll give you one slap! Namaste. Remember me? The name's Chandan. This line is busy. Please call later. Are you busy with Koli? Will you shut up! - This must be Chandan! Give the phone! Hello! Brother 3! - What news? We're on the highway. - This early? Today's our mini honeymoon. - Oh no! Saying it's their honeymoon. - Shit! You're married? Got hitched at the temple yesterday. Really? - Adi said I wasn't supposed to tell. Just forget it... Adi told you not to tell? Hello! - You have to eat whatever I get. Tell me. - Are you a human? How could you do this? She was joking. She's mad. You swear? - Brother! Careful! Money? - Coming. Haven't paid for ice-cream. - Ok, wait. Crazy girl! - The money... You can't turn back time. You come here every year, at this time. What's the point? Start afresh. This is your marriage! Go and fix it! Tell her everything! You want to live in your past. And die in it too. Say it! You can't! Why are you making their lives Hell! What have they done to you? Selfish! Only you and I know that you guys were married. There are so many people who can't marry the person of their choice. But do they not survive? Try again. Once more. Adi, you can do it... I can be the rain or the road for you... If you'd like, I could paint a river, I have travelled beyond reason... Can a boy love a girl that much? Chandan please don't tell Adi anything. Don't tell him I know. - Don't worry about that. I'm too sozzled to remember a thing. I might even forget you. I'll be off now. But before I go, let me tell you... When someone who's in love gets drunk, he may have a heart failure. And if a married man drinks, Then his whole life is a failure. But today he's alone. Let me get him. Sorry! Come on... Careful... Ok? Good night. Sorry Nayantara... When those closest to you, leave you alone... The whole world loses colour. It feels like life has stopped... But out of the ashes of life, a ray of hope appears. Then life starts anew. It has happened to me. It'll happen to you too. I'll be waiting. Life is not over, Nayantara. It will start again. It feels like life has stopped... We've walked a 1000 paths, And in the ups and downs, I hold close to you. When the weather is grey, If I get a little time, I want to tell you how I feel. Some are just wishes, That shall never be fulfilled, Take me with you today... Take me forward, A step or two... I want to walk along with you... Take me forward, A step or two... I want to walk along with you... Take me forward, A step or two... I want to walk along with you... Take me forward, A step or two... I want to walk along with you... Adi? Get up. You look like an angel when you sleep. And in real life you look like a ghost. Not a ghost but a banshee! Now get up. I've made you tea. Good morning young man. You're quite a late riser. Are you always this late? Waking Adi up is a real task. - Really? Getting him ready for office is a war! Only I know what it takes to get him to office on time. You've completely transformed my daughter's life. Go and get fresh. Dad has been waiting for quite a while. We'll have breakfast together. Drama queen! So this is what she's been planning... You haven't taken your towel as usual. When will you grow up? Take this. Your friends and the tenants are all here. Please hurry up! What? - Come fast. Ch- Chandan? She's done something! Adi! Be careful! Ok? Happy Birthday! Thank you. Why are you flustered? Cut the cake! Surprsise! - Thank you! Cut it... Happy Birthday to you... What's wrong with you? Looks like you've been brought to the slaughter. Cut it... - I was saying... Can't there be a birthday without cake? - Never! Can't have a Puja without sacrifice! Adi please... There we go... Happy Birthday to you... Adi, you're really something. - Happy Birthday... Happy Birthday. This is your gift. Take it. Take it... Don't open it in front of people. It's special. I've specially selected it for you. Only for you. So you'll see it alone. Hey! You forgot me... Picture... No, no. - Just come. Come! Take it. Your wife? Nice one! Here. - Who will eat so much? You all will. Waking up late is a sign of a happy married life. Has Nayan ever got you beer? Nayan, drinks beer? If she drank vodka, he'd join her. No, no, it's not that. When Nayan wants something from me, she bribes me with a beer. Wanted to know if she's started it with you. She'll need to get a crate for him. What are you saying? So she has never got you a beer? No, uncle. He wants to kno if you have beer here? You still haven't opened your gift. Open it - See it. Wait! Remember, your wife told you to open it alone. Get out! 1911 can never be repeated. - That's history! Did you see it? Yes I did. - Yes, I saw you. Chandan... Excuse me. Nayan? Are you living well? I'm fine. You saw it for yourself. Do you think I'm not ok? Dad! - I know you act to make me feel at ease. But Adi. Why does he act? Dad, you don't understand. - That's all Nayan. No need to explain. Just be careful. I'm going to Germany for 3 months. See you when I get back. - Yes. Take care. Why are you so tense? - Saw how she acted in front of her Dad? Total drama queen! - Have you ever told her that you love her? Have you ever told her the things, you tell me? Then how do you expect her to cuddle you and say she loves you? Don't you get it? She wants a divorce! Why are you sitting alone? Oye! What's wrong? Confusion... The things we don't accept, the things we tolerate... Are difficult to disclose. How will you disclose? Didn't understand a thing. Have you tried explaining it? - I did. I just heard about it. He's seen it himself. Adi, there's still time. Tell her. I love you. Are you mad? If he can change and start anew, then why can't I? Correct! Let's get a beer. But your Australian transfer is confirmed. For 2 years. The decision is obviously yours. So think about it. Some are just wishes, That shall never be fulfilled, Take me with you today... Take me forward, A step or two... I want to walk along with you... Whose story is this, Who is writing it? What have you done for her? If you think... that taking her to the hospital and calling her twice is enough then you're mistaken. You'd do much more for any of your neighbours. What have you done to prove that you love her? Why should she stay with you? Whose story is this, Who is writing it? Who is moving out of the dark in to the light? Some are just wishes, That shall never be fulfilled, My wife doesn't like it. She doesn't like a drunkard. I want to walk along with you... Wow! Breaking news! Go hom today and now! See you. Hey Adi! Chocolates and flowers. Cheers! We've walked a 1000 paths, I just heard about it. He's seen it himself. And in the ups and downs, I hold close to you. When the weather is grey, If I get a little time, I want to tell you how I feel. What happened? - There's a letter from Nayantara's office. I'll give it to her. - Who are you? I'm her husband. - Ok, sir. Hello Adi Uncle! - Hello! You didn't drink today? I know you don't like it, so... Want a beer? One beer? Thank you. The beer is basically a bribe. She wants a divorce! Adi... I don't know where to start? I was saying- - That you want a divorce. Isn't it so? You don't like me. You want to be freed. I approve. You are free for the rest of your life. Take care. No. That's not it... Actually... I'm going to Australia tomorrow. So I was thinking about how I should say this to you. I got this beer for you myself. That's all. Nothing else. Drink your beer. Whose story is this, Who is writing it? Who is moving out of the dark in to the light? Some are just wishes, That shall never be fulfilled, Take me with you today... Take me a few steps forward... I want to walk along with you... Take me a few steps forward... I want to walk along with you... Did I misunderstand you? You're correct. I was wrong. Adi? - Yes. Could you drop me to the airport tomorrow? I'll drop you tomorrow. Go to sleep. Good night. Whose story is this, Who is reading it? Who is living in a fairytale? Whose story is this, Who is reading it? Who is living in a fairytale? Some are just wishes, That shall never be fulfilled, Take me with you today... Take me a few steps forward... I want to walk along with you... It's time. I want to walk along with you... Did you tell her? - I'm dropping Nayantara to the airpot. Talk to you later. We've walked a 1000 paths, And in the ups and downs, I hold close to you. When the weather is grey, If I get a little time, I want to tell you how I feel. Some are just wishes, That shall never be fulfilled, Let it be. I can carry my own luggage. Thanks. Nayan! Have you taken your medicine? Nayan! Bye. Why aren't you picking up? - She's gone. I couldn't tell her. - Where has she gone? There's no breaking news. - Hell with breaking news! Hello, Adi... Hello? I told you- - Where are you Adi? Please come to the entrance. - I'm coming. Right now! Adi... - What's wrong? At the immigration counter... Siraj! Siraj! Madam, you're done. Please let the others through. Next, please! Calm down. Stay right here. - Where are you going? Yes? Do you know Nayantara? Who are you? I'm Adi. - Who are you to Nayan? I'm her husband. I am married. I could not face my father on taht day. That's why I left my own country. I'm from a low income family. What am I to say to Nayan now? Let's get married? You could have said, Nayan I am sorry. You could have said that you haven't forgotten her. I haven't forgotten Nayan. And I know that she can't forget me either. That's why I sent fake news of my death. I was helpless. - You could have asked how she was? Very few people are lucky enough to marry the ones they love. But it is possible to fall in love after marriage. Isn't that so? You'll keep her well. See you. I tried to explain things. Trust me. But he didn't listen. Who do you think you are? Hero! Trying to play God? Listen! He is dead to me. You are alive! But you don't have the patience to listen to me. Always in a hurry! Critical and pessimistic. When I wanted to open up to you, you thought I wanted a divorce. When I told you that I saw Siraj, you ran to him! Aren't you ashamed!? You are intolerable and impossible! We can never be together. If you had opened this, then we wouldn't be in this situation. Open it alone. It's special. I selected it for you. Nayan! - I won't wait for you. Go back to your alcohol! That is your life! Stop! I am not afraid of my Dad. And I don't think I'm God. I love you. Sorry brother. I already have a boyfriend. Fit and fine! Whose story is this, Who is writing it? Who is moving out of the dark in to the light? Some are just wishes, That shall never be fulfilled, Take me with you today... I want to walk along with you... Wow! Breaking news! Go hom today and now! IF
