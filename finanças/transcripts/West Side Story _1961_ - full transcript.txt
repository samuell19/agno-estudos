Watch this shot now! Shoot, man! Go! Yeah! - Chickie! Chick, chick, chick! - Boy! Jet boy! Jet boy! Jet, Jet, Jets! - Come back! - Come over here! Chickens! Beat it! Yeah! All right, go, Jets! Snowboy! Come on! Beat it! Chico! Andale, chico! Okay, here we go! Over here, A-Rab! Jets! Jets! Bernardo! Indio! Chaco, come on! Jets, come on! Follow me, baby. - Mira, mira, mira! - Jets! Andale, Chico! Come on, Jets! Hey, Jets! Hello! Jets, come on! Julio! Come on! Jets! Come on, boys! Come on, now! Jets! Break it up, you punks! Cut it out! Come on, guys! Break it up, I said! Come on, break it up! Come on! How many times have I told you punks to cut this stuff out? - Why, if it ain't Lt. Schrank! - Top of the day, Lt. Schrank. - And Officer Krupke. - Top of the day, Officer Krupke. - I'll give you the top of the head. - Hey you, get down! - But we're having such fun. - We enjoy the playground. See, it keeps us deprived children off of the foul city streets. Shut up! And born like we was on the hot pavement. - You wanna get your skull broke? - Hey, Baby John, come here! Come here! All right! Now, which one of these Puerto Ricans bloodied you? - Sir... - Which one? Excuse me, sir. As a matter of fact... we suspicion that the job was done by a cop. - Two cops. - At the very least. Impossible. In America, nothing is impossible. All right, wise guys... now, you listen to me! All of you! You hoodlums don't own these streets. And I've had all the roughhouse I'm gonna put up with around here! You wanna kill each other, kill each other! But you ain't gonna do it on my beat! - Are there any questions? - Yes, sir. Would you mind translating that into Spanish? Get your friends out of here, Bernardo. And stay out! Please. Okay, Sharks. VÃ¡monos. Boy, oh boy! As if this neighborhood wasn't crummy enough! Now, look, fellas. Fellas! Look, let's be reasonable... if I don't get a little law and order around here... I get busted down to a traffic corner... and your friend don't like traffic corners. So, that means you're gonna start makin' nice... with the PR's from now on. I said nice! Get it? 'Cause if you don't... and I catch any of you doin' any more brawlin' in my territory... I'm gonna personally beat the livin' crud out of each and every one of you... and see that you go to the can and rot there! - Say good-bye to the nice boys, Krupke. - Good-bye, boys. "Good-bye, boys." Jail? Gee. "You hoodlums don't own the streets." Go play in the park. Keep off of the grass. - Get out of the house! - Keep off the block. - Get outta here. - Keep off the world! A gang that don't own the street is nothin'! We do own it! Come on, Jets, round out! - Not you, Anybodys! Beat it! - Riff, you gotta let me in the gang! Didn't you just see me? I was smash! I'm a killer, I wanna fight. How else she gonna get a guy to touch her? - You dirty rat! - Come on, the road, little girl! The road! Beat it! - Beat it! - Okay, come on. Okay, now listen! Now, we fought hard for this turf, and we ain't just gonna give it up. The Emeralds claimed it, we shot 'em out. The Hawks, remember? They tried to take it away, we knocked them down the cellar. - But these PR's are different. - They multiply. Like cockroaches. - Shut the door! - They're eatin' all the food. - Breathin' all the air. - Help! I'm drowning in tamale. And you heard what that Lt. Schrank said... we gotta make nice with them Puerto Ricans or else. We gotta let 'em move in right under our noses... - and take it all away from us or else. - No! You're damn right, no! So what're we gonna do, buddy boys? I'll tell you what we're gonna do. We're gonna speed back! We're gonna move like lightnin', and we're gonna clean them Sharks up... once and for all. So they ain't never gonna set foot on our turf again! We're gonna do it in one all-out fight. - A rumble! Chop, chop! - Now cool, Action Boy. The Sharks want a piece of this world, too. And they're real down boys. They might ask for blades... - zip guns. - Zip guns? I ain't finalizin' and sayin' they will, Baby John. I'm just sayin' that they might, and we gotta be prepared. Now, what's your mood, Jets? - I say go, go! - I say mix! - I say sock 'em! - Tear them! - Yeah, but if they say blades or guns... - I say let's just forget the whole thing. - What? - What do you say, Riff? I say this turf is small, but it's all we got. I wanna hold it like we always held it, with skin! But if they say blades, I say blades. If they say guns, I say guns. I say I want the Jets to be the number one! - To sail! To hold the sky! - Then rev us off! Voom va-voom! Okay, cats, we rumble! Now... protocality calls for a war council... between us and the Sharks to set the whole thing up. So I will personally give the bad news to Bernardo. - You gotta take a lieutenant with you. - That's me. - That's Tony. - Who needs Tony? We need Tony! He's got a rep that's bigger than the whole West Side! - He don't belong no more. - Now, cut it, Action! - Me and Tony started the Jets. - So where is he? - How come he takes a lousy, stinkin' job? - Youth Board corrupted him. - Yeah, temporary sickness! - Wait and see. Remember them fists the day we clobbered the Emeralds? - He saved my ever-loving neck! - Sure! He'll do it again, too! He always came through for us and he always will. â™ª When you're a Jet you're a Jet all the way â™ª â™ª From your first cigarette to your last dyin' day â™ª â™ª When you're a Jet let 'em do what they can â™ª â™ª You've got brothers around â™ª â™ª You're a family man â™ª â™ª You're never alone â™ª â™ª You're never disconnected â™ª â™ª You're home with your own â™ª â™ª When company's expected â™ª â™ª You're well-protected â™ª â™ª Then you are set with a capital 'J' â™ª â™ª Which you'll never forget till they cart you away â™ª â™ª When you're a Jet â™ª â™ª You stay a â™ª â™ª Jet â™ª Now, I know Tony like I know me, and I guarantee you can count him in. - Let's get crackin'. - Where will you find Bernardo? - It ain't safe in PR territory. - He'll be at tonight's gym dance. - But the gym's neutral territory. - A-Rab, I'm gonna make nice with him. - I'm only gonna challenge him. - Right, daddy-o. So listen, everybody dress up sweet and sharp. Meet Tony and me at the dance after 10:00, and walk tall! - We always walk tall! - We're Jets! The greatest! â™ª When you're a Jet â™ª â™ª You're the top cat in town â™ª â™ª You're the gold-medal kid â™ª â™ª With the heavyweight crown â™ª â™ª When you're a Jet â™ª â™ª You're the swinginest thing â™ª â™ª Little boy you're a man â™ª â™ª Little man, you're a king â™ª â™ª The Jets are in gear â™ª â™ª Our cylinders are clickin' â™ª â™ª The Sharks'll steer clear â™ª â™ª 'Cause every Puerto Rican's a lousy chicken â™ª â™ª Here come the Jets â™ª â™ª Like a bat out of hell â™ª â™ª Someone gets in our way â™ª â™ª Someone don't feel so well â™ª â™ª Here come the Jets â™ª â™ª Little world, step aside â™ª â™ª Better go underground â™ª â™ª Better run, better hide â™ª â™ª We're drawin' the line â™ª â™ª So keep your noses hidden â™ª â™ª We're hangin' a sign â™ª â™ª Says 'visitors forbidden' â™ª â™ª And we ain't kiddin' â™ª â™ª Here come the Jets, yeah â™ª â™ª And we're gonna beat â™ª â™ª Every last buggin' gang â™ª â™ª On the whole buggin' street â™ª â™ª On the whole buggin' â™ª â™ª Ever-lovin' â™ª â™ª Street â™ª Yeah! - Tony, you're not even listenin'. - I read you loud and clear, Riff. - Then why don't you say somethin'? - I don't wanna hurt your feelings. - You're my buddy, my pal, my best friend! - Womb to tomb? Birth to earth. That's why you gotta come to the dance tonight and stand up with me. Come on, Tony. Just say yes. Riff, did you ever stop to figure... how many bubbles there are in one bottle of this here soda pop? Tony, this is important! Everything's important, Riff... you, me, the sweet guy I work for. The Sharks walk bad. They bite hard. - And if we don't stop them now... - Here! Work for a living. How do you like that? Four and a half years I live with a buddy and his family. I think I'm diggin' a guy's character. Boy, am I a victim of disappointment in you! End your sufferin', little man. Why don't you just pack up your gear and move out? 'Cause your ma's hot for me. No! It's 'cause I hate livin' with my buggin' uncle! - Come on! - Come on, uncle! Now... go play games with the Jets. And why not? They're the greatest. Ain't they? Were. You found somethin' better? No. Not yet, but... But What? You won't dig it, Riff. So try me. Come on, Tony, try me. Okay. Every single night for the last month, I wake up... and I'm reaching out. - For what? - I don't know. A dame? It's right outside the door, just around the corner... but it's comin'. What is? I don't know. It... it's like the kick I used to get from bein' a Jet. Now you're talkin'! Man, without a gang, you're an orphan. With a gang, you walk in twos, threes, fours... and your crew is the best... when you're a Jet, you're out in the sun, buddy boy... you're home free home! Riff, I've had it! Tony... Tony, look at me, will ya? - Come on, look at me. - I'm lookin' at you. Now, I never asked the time of day from a clock, did I? I never asked nothin' from nobody, but I'm askin' you... come to the dance tonight. I promised Doc I'd clean up the store tonight. Then do it after the dance. Tony, I already told the guys you'd be there. If you don't show, I'll be marked lousy. What time'd you tell 'em? 10:00. For me, Tony, for Riff! - 10:00 it is. - Womb to tomb? Birth to earth, and I'll live to regret this. Who knows? Maybe what you're waitin' for'll be twitchin' at the dance tonight. Yeah. Who knows? Who knows? â™ª Could be â™ª â™ª Who knows? â™ª â™ª There's somethin' due any day â™ª â™ª I will know right away â™ª â™ª Soon as it shows â™ª â™ª It may come cannonballin' down through the sky â™ª â™ª Gleam in its eye, bright as a rose â™ª â™ª Who knows? â™ª â™ª It's only just out of reach â™ª â™ª Down the block, on a beach â™ª â™ª Under a tree â™ª â™ª I got a feelin' there's a miracle due â™ª â™ª Gonna come true, comin' to me â™ª â™ª Could it be? â™ª â™ª Yes, it could â™ª â™ª Something's comin', somethin' good â™ª â™ª If I can wait â™ª â™ª Something's comin' â™ª â™ª I don't know what it is â™ª â™ª But it is gonna be great â™ª â™ª With a click â™ª â™ª With a shock â™ª â™ª Phone'll jingle, door'll knock â™ª â™ª Open the latch â™ª â™ª Somethin's comin', don't know when â™ª â™ª But it's soon, catch the moon â™ª â™ª One-handed catch â™ª â™ª Around the corner â™ª â™ª Or whistlin' down the river â™ª â™ª Come on, deliver â™ª â™ª To me â™ª â™ª Will it be? â™ª â™ª Yes, it will â™ª â™ª Maybe just by holdin' still â™ª â™ª It'll be there â™ª â™ª Come on, somethin', come on in â™ª â™ª Don't be shy meet a guy â™ª â™ª Pull up a chair â™ª â™ª The air is hummin' â™ª â™ª And somethin' great is comin' â™ª â™ª Who knows? â™ª â™ª It's only just out of reach â™ª â™ª Down the block, on a beach â™ª â™ª Maybe tonight â™ª â™ª Maybe tonight â™ª â™ª Maybe tonight â™ª Por favor, Anita, you are my friend. - Stop it, Maria. - You must make the neck lower. And you must stop heckling me. We are working on our time now, not the old lady's. - One inch. How much can one little inch do? - Too much. Anita, it is now to be a dress for dancing, no longer for praying! Listen, with those boys, you can start in dancing and end up praying. Querida, one little inch. - Bernardo made me promise! - Bernardo! One month have I been in this country. Do I ever even touch excitement? I sew in this place all day. I sit at home all night. For what did my fine brother bring me here? - To marry Chino. - Chino. - When I look at Chino, nothing happens. - What do you expect to happen? I don't know. Something. What happens when you look at Bernardo? It's when I don't look that it happens. I think I will tell Mama and Papa about you and Nardo in the balcony... of the movies! - I will rip this to shreds! - No! But if you perhaps could manage to lower the neck... Next year. I hate that dress! Then don't wear it, and don't come to the dance with us tonight. Don't come? - Could we not dye it red at least? - No, we could not. White is for babies. I will be the only one there in a white... SÃ­. It is a beautiful dress. I love you! - Are you ready, ladies? - Nardo, come in. Is it not beautiful? Yes. - Very. - I didn't quite hear. Very beautiful. Come in, Chino. Do not be afraid. - But this is a shop for ladies. - We won't bite you till we know you better. Chino, you will keep both eyes on Maria tonight in case I cannot. You too, Anita. - My brother is a silly watchdog. - My sister is a precious jewel. What am I? Cut glass? Nardo, it is most important that I have a wonderful time at the dancing tonight. It is? Because tonight is the real beginning of my life... as a young lady of America. Let's go! Get outta here! Nardo. CÃ³mo estÃ¡? Chino. Chino! Pepe! Pepe! Come on, guys! Maria. Look what I got. Maria, these are some of my friends you've not met. Pick up. This is Loco. - Mucho gusto. - Encantada. - Teresita. My sister Maria. - Good evening. - And this is Luis and Rosa. - Encantada. Rosalie, ai. Oye, Nardo. All right, boys and girls. All right. Attention, please! Attention! Come here. Thank you. My, this is a fine turnout we have here tonight. It's all for you, glad hand. I know all of you boys and girls... are here because you want to make new friends... and get closer to old ones. Yeah! So, tonight, kids, we're gonna do something special. We're gonna have a get-together dance! Ginger! Peachy! All right, all right, now, kids, kids... I want you to form two circles. - How many? - Two. Boys on the outside, and girls on the inside. Where are you? All right. Now... when the music stops... each boy dances with whichever girl is opposite, okay? Okay! Two circles, kids! Well, it won't hurt you to try. It hurts. It hurts! It hurts. Snowboy. I'm with it. That's it, kids! Keep the ball rolling. Round she goes, and where she stops, nobody knows. All right, here we go. Boys to my right, and girls to my left. - Mambo! - Mambo! Go! Tony! Mambo! Mambo! You're not thinking I'm someone else? I know you are not. Or that we've met before? I know we have not. I felt... I knew something never before was gonna happen, had to happen... but this is so much more. My hands are cold. Yours, too. So warm. So beautiful. Beautiful. It's so much to believe. You're not making a joke? I have not yet learned how to joke that way. I think now I never will. - Get your hands off, American! - Nardo! - Stay away from my sister. - Sister? - Couldn't you see he's one of them? - I saw only him. They want one thing from a Puerto Rican girl. - That's a lie! - Later, Tony! - Get away! - Don't listen. She'll listen to me before she listens to you. If you two want to settle this... Please, boys! Everything was going so well. Now, come on! We're all here to have a good time, aren't we? Nardo... Take her out of here. We're going home. - Nardo, it is my first dance. - Please. We are family. Now go. Come, Maria. Maria. - I don't want you. - I want you, though. I want you for a war council. Jets and Sharks. - The pleasure is mine. - Let's go outside. I would not leave the ladies here alone with your kind around. We will meet you at midnight. Doc's candy store? And no jazz before then. I understand the rules... native boy. Ice. - Doc's at midnight. Spread the word. - Right, daddy-o.

Someday, when you're an old married woman with five kids... you can tell me what to do. But right now it is the other way around. Now go to bed. He's the old married woman. You know, she has a mother. Also a father. They do not know this country any better than she does. And you do not know it at all. Girls here are free to have fun. - She is in America now. - Puerto Rico is in America now. Sometimes I don't know which is thicker, your skull or your accent. VÃ¡monos, muchachos! Let them wait. Is Maria all right? - I should be so all right. - It will not happen again. Pepe, Indio, after tonight, things will be settled. - First settle your stomach. - Never mind my stomach. - I mind your nose and your head broken. - Broken? Sure! They use Maria for an excuse to start World War III. - It is more than that. - More than what? She was only dancing. - With an American who's really a Polack. - Says the Spic. You are not so cute. - That Tony is. - And he works. - A delivery boy. - And what are you? An assistant. SÃ­, and Chino makes half of what the Polack makes. Here comes the whole commercial! Your mother's a Pole, your father's a Swede... But you were born here, that's all that you need. You are an American. But us? Foreigners! Lice! Cockroaches! But it's true! When I think of how I thought it would be for us here... - we came like children believing... - Trusting with our hearts open! - With our arms open. - You came with your mouth open. You're the Spic, and you go back in handcuffs. I'm going back in a Cadillac. - Air-conditioned! - Built-in bar! - Telephone! - And television! Compatible color. If you had all that here, why would you wanna go back to Puerto Rico? Or even if you didn't have all that here, why would you wanna go back to Puerto Rico? - It's so good here? - It's so good there? We had nothing! We still have nothing, only more expensive. - Anita Josefina. - No. it's plain Anita now. - Margarita, et cetera. - You leave me alone. At least I let... Once an immigrant, always an immigrant! Look! Instead of a shampoo, she's been brainwashed! Stop it! She has given up Puerto Rico, and now she's queer for Uncle Sam.

"And don't let me catch none of youse here later!" - They treat us like we ain't even human. - He was pretty mad. So, what happened? A big fat nothin', right? Yeah, but suppose he comes back... while we are havin' the war council? We'll snow him some more. See, them cops... they believe everything they read in the papers about us JD's. So that's what we give 'em, somethin' to believe in. You! - Who, me, Officer Krupke? - Yeah, you! Give me one good reason... for not draggin' you down to the station house, you punk! â™ª Dear â™ª â™ª Kindly Sergeant Krupke â™ª â™ª Ya gotta understand â™ª â™ª It's just our bringin'-upke â™ª â™ª That gets us out of hand â™ª â™ª Our mothers all are junkies â™ª â™ª Our fathers all are drunks â™ª â™ª Golly Moses â™ª â™ª Naturally, we're punks â™ª â™ª Officer Krupke, we're very upset â™ª â™ª We never had the love that every child oughta get â™ª â™ª We ain't no delinquents, we're misunderstood â™ª â™ª Deep down inside us, there is good â™ª â™ª There is good â™ª â™ª There is good, there is good â™ª â™ª There is untapped good â™ª â™ª Like, inside the worst of us is good â™ª - That's a touchin' good story. - Let me tell it to the world! - Just tell it to the judge. - Who's gonna be the judge? â™ª Dear â™ª â™ª Kindly judge, your honor â™ª â™ª My parents treat me rough â™ª â™ª With all their marijuana â™ª â™ª They won't give me a puff â™ª â™ª They didn't wanna have me â™ª â™ª But somehow I was had â™ª â™ª Leapin' lizards! â™ª â™ª That's why I'm so bad â™ª â™ª Right! Officer Krupke, you're really a square â™ª â™ª This boy don't need a judge â™ª â™ª He needs an analyst's care â™ª â™ª It's just his neurosis that ought to be curbed â™ª â™ª He's psychologically disturbed â™ª â™ª I'm disturbed! â™ª â™ª We're disturbed, we're disturbed â™ª â™ª We're the most disturbed â™ª â™ª Like, we're psychologically disturbed â™ª Hear ye!

Too many worries. - Any of you seen Tony tonight? - You betcha we did. He was supposed to clean up the store. Maybe he decided to clean up the PR's instead. Tony? - Doc, you ain't gonna close up now. - I'm not? - Listen, we got a war council here. - A who? To determine weapons. We gotta set up a mix with the PR's. Weapons. You couldn't play basketball? - Get with it, buster. - You don't understand. We got special business comin' here tonight. - Makin' trouble for the Puerto Ricans? - They make trouble for us. For you, trouble is a relief. We gotta stand up to 'em, Doc. It's important. Fightin' over a little piece of street is so important? - To us, it is! - To hoodlums, it is. Who you calling hoodlum? - War council... - Don't start that. - Rumbles. Why, when I was your age... - When you was my age! When my old man was my age, my brother was my age... You was never my age, none of ya. And the sooner you creeps get hip to that, the sooner you'll dig us! I'll dig you an early grave, that's what I'll dig. Dig, dig, dig! - Okay, Doc, set 'em up. Cokes all around. - Let's get down to business. So, Bernardo hasn't learned the procedures of gracious living. I don't like you, either, so cut it. Okay, kick it, Dos. - Boys, couldn't you maybe talk... - Kick it! We challenge you to a rumble. All out, once and for all. Accept? On what terms? Whatever terms you're callin'. You crossed the line once too often. - You started it. - Who jumped Baby John this afternoon? Who jumped me the first clay I moved here? - Who asked you to move here? - Who asked you? - Back where you came from. - Spies. - Mick! - Wop! We accept. - Time? - Tomorrow? After dark. - Place? - The park? The river. Under the highway. - Weapons? - Doc! Doc! - Tony! - Weapons! Weapons. - You call. - Your challenge. Afraid to call? Rocks. Belts. - Pipes. - Cans. - Bricks. - Bats. - Clubs. - Chains. Bottles, knives, guns! - What a coop full of chickens. - Who are you callin' chicken? - Every dog knows his own. - I'm calling you all chicken! Big, tough buddy boys gotta throw bricks. Afraid to get in close? Afraid to slug it out? Afraid to use plain skin? - Not even garbage? - That ain't a rumble. - Who says? - You said call weapons. A rumble can be clinched by a fair fight, if you've got the guts to risk that. Best man from each gang to slug it out. I would enjoy to risk that. Okay. Fair fight. Wait a minute! The commanders say yes or no. Fair fight. When I get through with you, you will be like a fish after skinning. Your best man fights our best man. And we pick him. - But I thought I would be fighting with... - You shook on it. Yes. I shook on it. Look, Bernardo, if you wanna change your mind... Bernardo, baby, would you like a cigarette? No, thank you. I don't smoke. Evening, Lieutenant. I and Tony was just closing up. Now, this is more like it, fellas. Warms me all over to see you this way. And after only a couple of words from me at the playground. How about that? Do you mind? I have no mind. I'm the village idiot. You know, headquarters hears about this, I may even get a promotion. Good deal all around, Bernardo? I get a promotion... and you Puerto Ricans get what you've been itchin' for... use of the playground, use of the gym... the streets, the candy store. So what if they do turn this whole town into a stinkin' pigsty? Don't stop him! He wants to get home, write letters to San Juan... tell 'em how he's got it made over here! What I mean is, clear out, you! I said, clear out! Yeah, sure, I know. It's a free country, and I ain't got the right. But I got a badge. What do you got? Things are tough all over. Beat it! Okay, fellas... where's the rumble gonna be? Come on! Regular Americans don't rub with the gold teeth unless... - Lieutenant... - You shut your mouth! Come on, Baby John. Before that smooth little kisser of yours gets out up for life. Now, where's it gonna be? The river? The park? Look, fellas, I'm for you. I want this beat cleaned up, and you can do it for me. I'll even lend a hand if things get rough. Now, where you gonna rumble? The playground? Sweeney's lot? Why don't you get smart, you stupid hooligans? I ought to take you to the station and throw you in the can now! You and the tinhorn immigrant scum you come from! How's your old man's DT's, A-Rab? How's the action on your mother's side of the street, Action? One of these days, there won't be anybody to hold you. Get him out of here! Come on! Beat it! Go! Don't worry! I'll find out where it's gonna be. So be sure to finish each other off, because if you don't, I will! Yeah, sure. Understand them. That's what they keep telling me down at headquarters. "Understand." You try keeping hoodlums in line, and see what it does to you. It wouldn't give me a mouth like his. Come on, Doc. - Don't let it get you. - I'm sick. - You heard. It's gonna be a fair fight. - And that's gonna cure somethin'? From here on in, everything's gonna be all right. - Got a feelin'. - What have you been takin' tonight? A trip to the moon! And I'll tell you a secret, Doc. It ain't a man that's up there. it's a girl. A lady. - Buenas noches, seÃ±or - Buenas noches? So that's why you made it a fair fight. I'm gonna see her tomorrow, and I can't wait. Tony! Things aren't tough enough? - Tough? Doc, I'm in love! - And you're not frightened? Should I be? No. No, I'm frightened enough for the both of you. What has Chino done to her? Chino? Why Chino? - Maybe she's just dolling up for us. - Gracias, querida. Rosalie, Consuelo, my adorable friends, can you keep a secret? I'm hot for secrets. No. I won't tell you. - What? - "What?" The poor girl is out of her mind. I am! Crazy. She might be at that. She looks somehow different. - I do? - And I think she is up to something. I am? "I do? I am?" She talks like a parrot.

Turn off the lights, and lock the doors. - Buenas noches, Anita. - Buenas noches. - AdiÃ³s - The jail is open. I thought she'd never leave. You know, it's hard to believe that old bag of a witch was once a young bag like us. Come on, let's go before she changes her mind and comes back. You go, querida. I will lock up. - Why? - I have work. Do it tomorrow. - I'm in no hurry. - I am! I'm going home now and take a nice, long bubble bath. - Black orchid. - Black orchid? All over. I gotta date with Nardo after the rumble. What rumble? Oh...well, uh... Nardo's Sharks and those boys at the dance. They fight each other tonight? They don't play patsy. Why must they always fight? You saw how they dance, like they gotta get rid of something quick. That's how they fight. To get rid of what? Too much feeling. And they do get rid of it. Boy, after a fight, that brother of yours is so healthy. Definitely black orchid. Buenas noches. "You go, querida. I will lock up." It's too early for noches. Buenas tardes. Gracias... buenas tardes. He just came from the drugstore to deliver aspirin. You'll need it. Not us. We're fine. - We're out of the world. - You're out of your heads. - We're 12 feet in the air. - Anita can see that. You will not tell? Tell what? How can I know what goes on 12 feet over my head? You better be home in 15 minutes. It's all right. She likes us. - But she is worried, and so am I. - That's foolish. Are you going to that rumble tonight? - No. - Yes! - Why? - You must go and stop it. I have stopped it. It'll only be a fistfight between two of 'em. Nardo... Any fight is no good for us. - Everything is good for us. We got magic. - Listen and hear me. You must go and stop it. It means that much to you? Yes. All right, I will, then. I believe you. - You do have magic. - Of course. I've got you. And tonight, after I stop the rumble that isn't a rumble... I'll come by for you. - I will wait for you on the roof. - No. Not the roof. I'll come to your house. You cannot. My mama. - Then I'll take you to my house. - Your mama? She'll come runnin' from the kitchen to welcome you. - She lives in the kitchen. - Dressed so elegant? I told her you were coming. She'll look at your face. Try not to smile. She'll say, "Skinny, but pretty." She is plump, no doubt? Fat. I take after my mama. Delicate-boned. Not in front of Mama! I would like to see Papa in this. Mama will make him ask about your prospects. Many. - If you go to church. - Always. Yes, Papa might like you. - May I have your daughter's hand? - He says, "Yes." Gracias. - And your mama? - I'm afraid to ask her. Tell her she's not getting a daughter. She's getting rid of a son. She says, "Yes!" She has good taste. Here. Maid of honor. - That color is bad for Anita. - The best man! That is my papa! Sorry, Papa. Here we go, Riff. Womb to tomb. Now, you see, Anita? There was nothing to worry about. Look!

Where we goin'? If we lay low, the coppers are gonna smell fish. - So the first thing we do... - Buddy boy! - Go wear a skirt. - I got scabby knees. Listen... First, start showing around like we got nothin' to hide. Suppose they ask us about the rumble. Supposin' they ask you where's Tony and what party's lookin' for him with a gun! You know somethin'? - I know I gotta go get a skirt. - Come on, Anybodys! - What's the freak know? - Plenty! I figured somebody oughta infiltrate PR territory... and spy around. I'm very large with shadows, you know. I can slip in and out of 'em like wind through a fence. - Boy, is she ever makin' the most of it. - You bet your fat "A," I am! - Spill it! - Okay. I hear Chino tellin' the Sharks somethin' about Tony and Bernardo's sister. And then I hear Chino say, "If it's the last thing I do, I'm gonna get that Polack." And then he pulls out the bad news! - Them PR's won't stop. - Till we stop 'em. Hold it! Now, listen... Tony come through for us. We gotta come through for Tony. - We gotta find him before Chino finds him. - And burns him. You cover the river! Snowboy, get over to Doc's. - I'll take the alleys. - We'll take the streets. - The park. - The schoolyard. We'll take the playground. What about me? You? In and out of the shadows. - Maybe you'll find Tony in one of them. - Right! You done good, buddy boy. Thanks, daddy-o. Who is... Maria. Maria, it's Anita. You in there? - Maria? - Yes. Open the door. I need you. No. - Now you are afraid, too? - What? I'll be right there. - Together. - But where? The bus station. We'll go so far away, they'll never find us. - How can we? - Doc will help us. I'll get money from him. - You'll meet me at his store. - At Doc's, yes. - I'll wait for you there. - All right. Yes.

I heard the boys talking. - He's hunting for Tony. - He is at Doc's store, waiting for me. If Chino hurts him, if he touches him, I swear to you, I'll... - You'll do what Tony did to Bernardo. - I love Tony. I know. I loved Bernardo. - Anybody home? - Yes. - Bernardo's sister, please. - She isn't feeling well. Who is? Hello, miss. I'm Lt. Schrank. I don't like to disturb you at a time like this... Yes, a very bad time. You'll excuse me, please. - I have a couple of questions to ask. - Afterwards, please. - I must go to my brother now. - Now, just one minute! - Can't you wait? - No! Now. You were at the dance at the gym last night... Will this take very long? As long as it has to. Excuse me. Anita, my headache is much worse. Will you go to Doc's store for me? Don't you people keep aspirin around? This is something special. Will you go for me, Anita? What shall I ask for? Doc will know. Tell him I have been detained and can't get there right away... or I would have picked it up myself. Excuse me. You were asking? Yeah. At the gym last night, your brother got into a heavy argument... because you danced with the wrong boy. - Yes. - Who was the boy? Another from my country. And his name? JosÃ©. - Can't find him. He ain't nowhere. - He's right down there in the cellar. - Tony? - Safe and sound. - I found him. - You warn him about Chino? - What's he doin' in the cellar? - Keepin' the mice company, stupid. - No sign of Chino? - Nothin'. His luck. I'll slip out the back and check the alleys again. - You guys hang here. - Right. - Boy, I'm thirsty. Where's Doc? - Upstairs raising getaway money for Tony. - Doc ain't got no money. - His mattress has. Come on. Cut the frabberjabber. Grab some readin' matter. Play the juke. Some of you get outside. If you see Chino or those stinkin' PR's comin... - I'd like to see Doc. - He ain't here. - Where is he? - He went to the bank. They made a mistake in his favor. The banks are closed at night. Where is he? You know how skinny Doc is. He slipped in through the night-deposit slot. And got stuck halfway in. Which indicates there's no tellin' when he'll be back. Buenas noches, seÃ±orita. Where you goin'? - Downstairs. - Didn't I tell you he ain't here? I'd like to see for myself. Please. Please. Por favor. - Will you let me pass? - She's too dark to pass. - Don't - Please don't. - Por favor. - No comprende. - Gracias. - De nada. Mambo! - Listen, you! - We're listenin'. Look, I gotta give a friend of yours a message. - I gotta tell Tony... - He ain't here. - I know he is. - Who says he is? - Who's the message from? - Never mind. Couldn't be from Chino, could it? Don't you understand? I want to help! - Bernardo's girl wants to help? - Even a greaseball's got feelings. - But she wants to help get Tony. - No! - Not much. Bernardo's tramp. - Bernardo's pig! - You lyin' Spic! - Don't do that. - Gold tooth! - Pierced ear! - Don't. - Garlic mouth. - I want to help! - Come on! - Go! - Chiquita! No! OlÃ©! OlÃ©! Hey, babe! Come on! Let's get her! - No, you don't. - Come on, baby. Come on! Stop it! What are you doing there? Bernardo was right. If one of you... was lying in the street bleeding... l'd walk by and spit on you! She'll tell Chino that Tony's in the cellar. Don't you touch me! I got a message for your American buddy. You tell that murderer that Maria's never going to meet him! You tell him that Chino found out about them... and shot her! She's dead! When do you kids stop? You make this world lousy! We didn't make it, Doc. Get outta here! Maria? Doc, I thought I heard... You got it! - Yes, I got it. - Doc, you're a pal. You're the best friend a guy ever had. I'll pay you back as soon as I can. I promise. - Forget that. - No, I'll never! I couldn't. Doc, you know what we're gonna do in the country, Maria and me? We'll have kids, and we'll name 'em all after you... even the girls, so when you visit us... Wake up! Is this the only way to get through to you... do just what you all do, bust like a hot water pipe? What's got into you? Why do you kids live like there's a war on? Why do you kill? I told you how it happened. Maria understands. - I thought you did, too. - Maria understands nothing... Never again. There is no Maria, Tony. What? - I can't. - No, no, Doc. Now, tell me. What is it? That was Anita upstairs. Chino found out about you and Maria... and he killed her. No. Maria. Not Maria, Doc. She's... Chino! Come and get me, too, Chino! - Come and get me, too! - Tony! Who's that? - It's me, Anybodys. Come on. - Get out of here! - Chino, come and get me, damn you! - What are you doin'? Get out of here! Why don't you come with me? We'll find... It ain't playin' anymore! Can't any of you get that? - But the gang... - You're a girl! Be a girl and beat it! Come on, Chino! Get me, too! I'm callin' for you, Chino! There's nobody here but me. Come on! Please, will you? I'm waitin' for you. I want you to. Maria. Tony! Maria. I didn't believe hard enough. Loving is enough. Not here. - They won't let us be. - Then we'll get away. Yeah. - We can. - Yes. - We will. - Yes. â™ª Hold my hand â™ª â™ª And we're halfway there â™ª â™ª Hold my hand â™ª â™ª And I'll take you there â™ª â™ª Somehow â™ª â™ª Someday â™ª â™ª Some... â™ª Stay back! How do you fire this gun, Chino? Just by pulling this little trigger? How many bullets are left, Chino? Enough for you? And you? All of you! You all killed him, and my brother, and Riff... not with bullets and guns. With hate! I can kill, too, because now I have hate! How many can I kill, Chino? How many? And still have one bullet left for me? No! Don't you touch him! Te adoro, Anton. English - US
