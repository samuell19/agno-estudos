My people have gone on a trip. Why didn't you call for me then? As if you'd jump the wall for me at night! Looks like your grandson is about to wed. You are too excited. Ask your son to find a bride for you too! Why would he have to do that? The village ladies crave for me wherever I go! Of course they would! - A jobless old man that you are! - Are you coming?

I was a bit busy, Grandpa. Busy with family or someone else? How I wish! Come, stand here. Make sure you stitch well! It's my grandson's wedding! It's confusing if it's your grandson or you who is about to wed. You are too excited. Won't all the attendees come to wish the Grandfather of the groom? Yeah, that's what they should do now. There are people who would come to see me too. Yeah why not! Here... Why is this bland? Get some sugar. You're lucky to have this! Wait! Stand here. Can't stay put! Go sit there. This man has a habit of pulling arms. Huh? Looks like it is Raju! Hey Rajayya! Where are you headed to? Just around the corner. Your Grandson is about to wed in two days. Where is your treat? Always the same thing! Trying to feast at other's celebrations. Have you ever invited anyone for a meal at your place? Why would I do that without an ocassion? Yeah, I know how generous you are! Ah! Do you think he would invite everyone for a meal on his daughter's wedding? Why do you bother? Just have the tea! Here... Why do you act like a miser? Another spoon of sugar! You are acting like you are my husband! Ah! Ignoring! Shining dressed in your best! My daughter is pregnant, Uncle. I'm paying her a visit. Why are you dressed to kill in that case? Or is it that you are pregnant too? Ah! My morning is ruined! Look who is angry! Why do you mind? Mind your business! Hey girl! Always on the phone! Is she cooking fish? The smell is lip smacking. Is that Catla or Murrel, young lady? [lady laughing] Oh no Grandpa. Actually, its the neighbors. You know we don't cook non-vegetarian on Fridays. Wouldn't I call you if I'm cooking fish? - How long would you hold him here? - Hey! Why did you pinch him at this hour? - Can't you hold it till night? - Oh no Grandpa! Keep the house open for everyone. [Narsi groans] One must have some control over one's wife, Narsi. You leave now! I'll get your clothes, go. - I wonder how he'd live! - Started morning it self... I wonder when he'd die! [sighs] Swaroopa... when is your son's pre-wedding ceremony? Its just the day after tomorrow, aunt. Did you call your daughter then? Don't you know how it is, Aunt? Why do you say that? She is your daughter after all. How can you skip such a perfect ocassion? Why don't you remind Ailaiah once? [Swaroopa sighs heavily] As if he pays heed to anything I say! - Listen to me! - Let it takes any time! I won't let the tractor move till my farm is totally done. But the tractor is sitting idle! You just shout without understanding. What? On whose farm are you working on? And you are blaming me? - Leave now! - Please understand. Don't talk, just leave! - What happened, Aunt? - What the hell? I'll leave after ploughing your farm. I'll finish this and come to you. Ah! you are talking as if you are doing it for free! Go plough his farm. You can leave! Why do you make a mess out of a simple situation? The workers have kept the saplings ready. They'd dry up. Please understand. Let them dry up or die! Just get your tractor out of here! Get lost! - You should come now. - He doesn't listen. - I'll come in a while. - Don't worry, I'll pay you all. He is telling me what to do. There are more tractors in the village. Why don't you tell him to calm down? Do you think he is the kind who would listen to a woman? Hey! What are you talking now? Are you giving me lunch or leaving with them? - How are you dealing with this man! - Come now! Go serve him food. That's enough. Your son is worthless! He isn't smart enough even to get some bones with marrow in a kilo of meat! Don't know how busy is he. Don't you support him! He didn't study well. I asked him to take care of the farm but he is into some business. He is getting a dowry of 15 lacs because of that business. And how did he setup that business? I gave him 5 lacs after selling an acre of land. No returns yet! He just says he is expanding his business. Why are you worried? He is just working hard. Did he do something wrong to tarnish the respect of our family? Respect of the family? I'll hack you both if it comes to that! Tell me. I tried hard to sleep in the night. But I couldn't sleep at all. Why? Don't you know why? It was 7:30pm when I slept too. So late!-Yeah. Okay, why didn't you answer my call then? Oh no! My mother was sleeping beside me! Would your mother sleep beside you even after the wedding? Hey, naughty! Sai... Are you applying the beauty cream I told you? Ah! I don't like them at all. Apply it. You'd look great in the engagement photos. Do you mean I don't look good now? You do. But do apply it. Sailu! Yeah!-Who is it? I'll call you back. Mwah!-Bye. [humming] - Look how shabbily the guys are dressed! - What a generation? Why is everyone here? I told you, I'd claim the chit fund amount this time. My Son-in-law says he wants money. And what brings you here? We planned to buy a new Television on this festival. Tell him! That's true. I'm planning to buy a new television. How big? 60 or 70 inches? Acting smart! Don't be kidding. Are we fools? Everyone has their need. You spend it if you want. Why don't you speak? Yeah! Everyone's need kicks in when its my turn! What crap is this? Bro... You gave it. Now go!

You take the call! Rs. 5,300. Rs. 5,500. - Rs. 5,600. - That's it. Rs. 6000. Raise it! Why don't you call it yourself instead of poking him? I'd be uncomfortable doing it before all these men.

Anyone? What Uncle? - You, cousin? - What can we say? Let's go! - Why did you raise it crazily? - What else can we do? How else do we earn? [both laughing] I gave an injection right, you'll feel better. - Okay. - Call me if you don't. - Will do. - Hey, put it down. Every thing is fine, but it would've been better if you put a mattress on this... All my bones ache! Oh yeah! Will arrange a mattress full of jasmines as if it's your honey moon? Get down, get out. Ah! He is spoiling everything. Hey kid, what's all this? Get up. Disgusting! - Oh God! - Lady, didn't you find any other place? Have you gone mad, how many times should I tell you? If he pees on it, it would cost 50,000 rupees for repair. - Dude, I ordered a table... - Don't you dare do it again... You think that's a stretcher? It's a God damn snooker board man. Shut up. Lady, where are you taking that ball? Leave it on the table. You have so many balls, is this golden? Take it. Sorry dude. I should hit my self with a shoe for arranging a snooker board in this village. [humming] "Oh my Brother-in-law" [humming] Love you!

I was anticipating, have you started. I've been watching you since ages. You are playing with him as if he is some toy. If I won't play with my husband would you? Look how she is talking to me. Aunty, keep quiet. What else can I do? This has been happening since long. My only brother is gone, what is left for me here. - Why did you mess with her? - She can't even respect elders. - What wrong did I say? - She is talking nonsense. And look at him, sitting like a bull. Is he trying to stop her? Of course, she will talk all she wants. Damn with his boozing habit. No... No, the other leg. Come in. She is the one. Look how beautiful she is, Komuraiah has left with seeing him getting married. I can see how beautiful she is. They said it right "The luck a lady or cow brings a home" Hey oldie! Shut your mouth. Aren't you ashamed? I've been watching you roam behind her. Aunt, what nonsense are you talking. I am speaking the truth. Before your daughter could step into our home she took my brothers life. Don't know how many lives would be lost after she comes. - Have you gone mad, how can you blame her? - Mother-in-law, stop it. Damn you, how dare you talk to me like that. - Go to hell! - Look, how this oldie is talking. Shut up, how can you talk like that? - Why should I? Why should I shut up? - What happened? You want to marry your unlucky daughter to my grandson? - As if you are the only family. - Uncle, let me talk to her. The thought of marrying my daughter into this family itself is great. - Did you listen? - Who the hell are you to talk about us? - Watch your mouth. - Calm down oldie. Take your girl and get out of here. I can see how everyone are living their lives. Hey, let's go guys. [indistinct chatter] Father-in-law... Please, let me take care of this. Listen to me.

Get lost. - Sai, leave him. What's wrong with him? - You fool! Why talk about booze now? - We won't get the time later. Think about what you need to do. Forget about him. - Shorty! - They aren't getting it. Dear brother, your son-in-law say's he is leaving. Who is there to pacify him? If you were alive, wouldn't you have cared for him? Who will stop him, my dear brother. Sandhya, what are you waiting for? Let's go. - How can you leave before the 11th day? - That's the tradition here. Why should I stay here and for whom? Sandhya how long should I wait? Let's go. Father, I didn't take care of you while you were alive. I am a sinner. Is it the end of my bonding with my maternal home, dear father. [women sobbing] - Son, as he gave you his daughter... - You are facing hard times, dear. You have that responsibility. But you are adamant that you'd leave. The society might speak ill about you. Listen to me son. Alright, so be it. Hey! Is it our only job to plead with people who want to leave? Stop staring at me and get the photo frame of your grandpa. - Go now. - Why is everyone yelling at me? - Sailu! - Yes. - Well, as my brother-in-law is here... - Okay. Well... - Thank you. - It's okay. Damn it! Everyone has a photo, they should have photographed grandpa. - You have a iPhone charger? - No. Why don't you check with your friends? Will you die if you don't use your phone for a day? Bloody you! Damn man! Only I should take care of everything. - Sai. - Yes. Can you go to my house and bring our clothes? Aunty, I don't know where you live. Sandhya! Yes mother. Go along with Sai and bring our clothes. No need, I'll take an auto. Why go alone, go with Sai. Sai take her. - Go my child. - What are you looking at, take her. - Don't know when will this oldie die. - Go now. - What the hell! - Stop... Stop... Careful, let the sheep go first. Didn't you have no other place to go, you came in this narrow lane? Why the hell did you come in this narrow lane? You could've took another route. - Yelling at me. - Leave now. Didn't you have no other place to go, you came in this narrow lane? Why the hell did you come in this narrow lane? You could've took another route. As if these streets are meant for your sheep? Go... Go...[driving away the sheep] Showing off because a girl is sitting on your bike. Bro, why didn't you pay chit fund payment? My cousins marriage happened, I had expenses. Only you have expenses, we don't. - Consider this time. - Why should I... If I give such excuses would you consider? - I will pay up, go now. - Trying to act smart. Damn you. How long will you hide from me? - What happened? - You think I can't find you? - Hey! Hit him. - Sorry, bro. - You said you had some work here? - Hit him hard... - You should've thought before borrowing... - When will you pay, shame on you. - Hey... - Hey, watch out. - I know. - Are you blind? Stop... Stop... Why did you ask me to stop here? Because this is my house, why would you stop else where? SANDHYA BOREWELLS... SANDHYA RICE MILLS... SANDHYA REAL ESTATES. Whom are you looking for? - I am Lakshmi's nephew. - Oh! Are you her brother's son? Yes. Lakshmi always used to talk about her maternal home. Her heart was always there. She was not able to take care of her father while he was alive. Hell with these disputes. Boy, you are handsome! If things were right, you would've been the son or son-in-law to Lakshmi. I wonder who is destined to inherit this massive property. Sandhya! Hey Sandhya! [music mutes voices] Greetings uncle. You said something and the opposite happened, where is my money? Don't worry about the money, my father-in-law who is inside is a huge businessman... His only daughter, I will marry her. He handed over his properties and businesses to me. Then why did you run behind that girl while you have a good alliance? I mean... we grew up together right? How can I marry her? If I marry her now, people would say I married for money. More over I least bother about money, you know it very well. I don't care whom you would marry, give me my money. He said he will give me money, but I refused... Because these 11 days we are not supposed to. I don't care. Hey, it's not good for us if we take money from him today, you keep quite. Uncle, you want money? I will ask him now. You said you will give after 11 days, it's okay. I want my money back on the 12th day... You know about me, right? - I do. - Let's go. See you. [voice muted] Uncle, sit on the cot. It's okay, I will sit here. - Greetings. - Greetings. Half kilo curry won't be sufficient, and only one bottle. Sit down man. This is only for family. Can you please leave? Why will we be here if it's for family, we will have a couple of drinks and leave. Absolutely. [old man groans] Uncle, sit down, give me five minutes. No uncle, I won't. - Come on son. - No uncle. - Ailaiah, why he is acting like a kid? - Kids brought you something. - Why is he adamant? - Can you keep quiet? - I beg you, come I am here for you. - No uncle... Okay let's go. - Sailu... - Enough. Looks like you got a special bottle for your father-in-law? Put it aside. Uncle, give me your glass. Not this one, please pour me that one dear. Rajesh, take care of them. - You want special one? - Uncle, is that enough? - Some more. - For me too. Wait. Have it guys. Cheers! Rajesh, give me some more. What are you looking at? It's getting dark, shouldn't we go home. Pour. - Can't you wait? Here. - Pour. I feel that Komuraiah is still with us. Even I feel the same. Father, where did you go? - I am drinking because of you father. - Brother-in-law... Brother-in-law, if you cry will he come back? Have it. Your daughter-in-law said, this time we shall take you along to Surat. I thought of taking you on a ride to show Surat on my scooter. Whom should I take on a ride now? - Aunty, tell my father to come back. - Will he come back if you cry? Calm down Mogili. My brother was deprived a lot. What can you do? Have it son, drink up. - Ailaiah! - Yes. Until 11 days, we are not supposed to do anything. We need an elderly man to take care of things, right? Why someone else, aren't you there? Some one like you must be there, I am too old. You can handle it, I know. Ailaiah! Whom all would you invite tomorrow? As it's third day, why call outsiders? Let it be family affair. Komuraiah is not an ordinary man, you must invite everyone. - That's the tradition. - Yes. - We won't follow those traditions. - We know our tradition... No need of an outsider to teach us. Same old story, they don't know about things and wouldn't listen when told. But never short of ego. Yes we are egoists, we are not living on ones mercy. I can see, you speak tall but you do nothing. Shameless lives! Damn it! Sailu I don't know what you'll do... Four lambs must be sacrificed tomorrow morning. - Four! - The whole village must feast tomorrow. - I'll show him... - I'll see... - Let me see... - I'll show you... - Let's see how many will you sacrifice. - Uncle, calm down. - Father! - No one is scared of your husband. - I've seen many like him. - Hey, go now. - Come on man, let's leave. - Okay. Why do they have ego issues? If this prevails, they won't unite and you will not get married. He is right. - Let's meet tomorrow. - Let's go. - See you tomorrow. - Rajesh. let's go. - Sailu! They are like that... - Come on man, how can we get 4 lambs? They won't listen to us. Why would you burden yourself? Aunty, it's alright I will manage some how. Dude, try hard just four lambs man. I will pay for it. I won't run away. Get necessary things for cooking. We suddenly thought of it. Uncle please, listen to me. I will pay you, come down early tomorrow. Dude, bring a couple of tents, 10 vessels and all necessary things. Why do you care dude, just bring all I said. Okay, bye. Give me one, Aunt! - I will give, play out side for a while. - Give those fries. I've put every dish in there. Sujatha, give her oil packets. What are you doing, can't you listen? Can't you wait? This oldie has nothing else to do... - Other than yelling at me always. - Calm down. Only they are taking care of things. No one else is. Mom, I can't find my hair band. "Death and birth are like No-moon day and Full-moon day" "It's a celebration if everyone comes together" "The tune which started changed into sob music" Here, only these are left. Please use carefully. - I am adding the gravy please see. - Do it, what's there in it? Hey, Sailu... Sailu, come take a look I am adding meat. "Whatever drama we play between, we do it united" "Whatever drama we play between, we do it united" Uncle, make good gravy... - Hey, watch him man. - Okay. "Whether it's death or birth, it's celebrated well" Wow! They are cooking mutton. "One should announce it to the folks and celebrate" "One should announce it to the folks and celebrate" Ailaiah, this way. - Get down, dear. - Please hold this. - Keep it on the table. - It's getting late, let's go. Narayana, let's leave now. - Come let's go. - Let's go. - Sandhya, let's go. - Let's go, it's getting hotter. Sailu, let's go it's getting late. - You carry on, I'll come after cooking. - Okay. - They are leaving man. - How many cans did I say... And how many he sent? Is he a human? Shame on him. Take that one. Look, take that one. That one, the small one beside that. Okay, let's go. Good, tie it tighter. Let's go. Fill the plate, fill it properly. Alright, put Jilebi. - Mogili, put these in the plate... - Take this, sister. Ailaiah, put the egg. Place it properly. - Put the cigar. - Did you put every item? - Put it there. - Check once again. Oh God! Komuraiah brother, where did you go? Father, eat well. Did you pray properly? Come here son, pour this. Catch it. Catch it well. Brother, why can't I see a single bird. Where did they go? [cawing like a crow] [cawing like a crow] Why aren't the crows coming? [cawing like a crow] [crow cawing] Ah! Look, Komuraiah has come. There he is. Take few steps back. Brother, you came! Please, have your meal. Komuraiah, what are you waiting for? Have your meal. - What's wrong? - Stop acting like a kid... They've arranged everything for you. Come down. Brother you came but why are you roaming? - I beg you, please come and eat. - What? Brother, why isn't he coming? Where is Sailu? He said he would come as soon as cooking is finished. Hell with cooking! He is the only grandson, won't he come and pray? Poor thing, he must be waiting for his grandson. Komuraiah, he will come don't worry. Sailu, come soon every one is waiting for you. Son, why the crow is not coming? Did grand father say something to you? He didn't tell any thing to me, I didn't say anything to him. - Hey... Hey... - I don't know anything. - Oh God. - Let's sit in the shade, it's hot here. Why is the crow delaying it? Don't know what's happening here. - Won't the curry cook without you? - Wait man... Pray well, son. Komuraiah, now that your grandson came, have it. - Where is he going? - He was always like this. Look how he is staring at us. It's almost an hour! - Huh. - Komuraiah is like that, playing with us. The crow is really torturing them. What's wrong with you brother? - What's bothering you? - [indistinct voices] - Why aren't you coming? - Calm down aunty. What's bothering you dear brother. Shut up, wait for some time it will come. Is it? If it was to come it would've by now, let's go. Wait son, wait for some time. How long you want us to wait? If it was to come it would've by now. Why will it sit there only? I am feeling ashamed in front of everyone. Should've taken care of him while he was alive. What's the use of sacrificing lambs after he is dead? More over these guys are arrogant, disgusting. Now let's go, some dogs or pigs will come and eat. Narayana! Narayana! Showing off now, as if they did something great. [crow cawing] Brother, why are you leaving? Get going! Make it quick. Here you go. What is it? Why are you so tensed? What did I plan and what's happening here? Why did the bird not touch it and why are these people fighting over that? I don't get a thing! - Come soon. - Don't worry. Everything would be fine. Huh? Damn you! I wonder who is enjoying whose celebration! - Keep your voice low! - Why should I? Brother-in-law... I got the money ready. It's your call now. Don't be hasty. I'll talk to Brother when the right time comes. Huh! Serve it. What are you gawking at? You aren't the host! Serve it. Wait a minute. Give it for free and people gulp down crap! - That soft piece please. - Move! - I've served good pieces! - How less is it! - I did! - Damn you! He is finishing up the curry! Listen Narsi... I wanted to give a feast to Komuraiah but he gave one to me instead! Eat well. Did Grandpa tell you something? Neither Grandpa told me anything, nor did I to him. Try to remember. - Hey! Hey Narsi! - I'm innocent. Something is fishy. Oh Brother! It's a great loss! We can't see your father again! Oh Brother! Why did you leave us so early, Uncle! Your sons took good care of you. Why did you leave us, uncle! - What can I say? - I think she doesn't know it! - Tell her. - He would always talk to me on the road. Ailaiah, who would ask my well being now! - [sobbing] - Sister... The crow didn't touch Grandpa's offering. - What? - The bird didn't touch it. Eh? Why would it touch it? Did these two ever take care of the old man? Ailaiah always has anger ready to burst. Oh damn! And Mogili lies somewhere in Surat! Did they ever take care of the old man? - I'm noticing it! - What crap are you talking? Did you take care of him then? - What is this? - You blame us! - Get out of here! - Sister... - Don't come here again. - As if I'm going to stay back! What? Ah! I have my own home! - Sister wait... - Let go! I'm leaving! - Look at her! - Aunt... What wrong did she say? You shut her down. Who will stop all the other people from talking? - Uncle. - Yes son. I stayed back as you asked me. I'll lose my respect if I stay with indecent people. I'll leave now. Sandhya, Lakshmi, start now. Wow! Here comes the man of honour. We are indecent people. What happened to his decency? He ate and drank! And he needs a costly bottle to drink! - He is leaving when it's time to help. - Hey, don't beat around the bush. - See that everyone? - Brother, you tell him at least! Who is going to take care of the upcoming ritual? Doesn't he know, the girl of the house has to do it. That is a formality. You don't need that. Eat drink and then escape your duties. Hey! I'm not escaping any duties. I'll do them! If you are so righteous, take care of the next ritual! Be a man enough and get the bird to eat it! Damn you! You question my vigour? - I'll show you now. - Oh no! You served just five lambs. I'll serve ten lambs on the ritual day. People from not just our village but the neighboring villages too will eat here. - I'll show you what I am! - Do it! - Ten lambs! - We shall see that. - I'll do it and show you! - We shall see that. Go. - You shall see it indeed! - Brother-in-law! [all]: Oh no! - He is leaving. - Wait. [sighs] Damn it! Recently, at the death of our uncle, we put the offering. Some 10 to 15 crows finished it immediately. They didn't take care of the old man. They just show off. He was so cross when I asked for the tractor for half an hour. How can he show his face to the villagers now? Do I ask him? The bird was just flying around but had not touched it. Why would it? You witnessed their fight. We don't know what are their internal tiffs. - I'll give you a surprise. - Rajesh? Wait a min! SAILU... RAJESH... DR. RAVI HOMAGE RIP GRANDPA Huh? Got it. I'll remove both our photos and highlight yours... You shameless man! He is not concerned about my woes! Is he in his senses? Is this some wedding? Look at that photo. Uncle! Why are you going many times today? Don't know. I'm feeling weird in my stomach since noon. That's the result of gulping down free food. Huh? Tell anyone you see that it would be ten lambs served the day after tomorrow. Alright. - Don't forget it! - OK! - 10 lambs. - I can't stop! Dude, is it fine with just your picture? - I'll slap you hard! - Hey stop! Leave him. What about the girl? She is a copy of her father! She is not giving a damn to me. If she doesn't say yes, it would be a problem. Get some clarity from her first. [girl singing] [singing] - Chitti come here! - Yeah! Shall we click a selfie? Sandhya, a selfie. [mobile ringing] [chuckles] Call. Once more. [mobile ringing] I phone back you. Busy busy. I've changed the style of the flex board. I'll call you back. - Hey... - Sandhya, another one. What? Here we go. My legs ache! Damn kids! Hey! Don't make noise. Shut up! You shut up! - Look at her! - Hey, that's wrong. What is she saying! Is this the way you educate children? - Start. - Did you hear her? Yeah yeah. - Awesome Chitti! - What can we say? She is like her mom! Come on! The old woman always cribs. - This girl is the reason for everything. - [girl starts crying] Oh! You hit the small girl! It's natural that kids make noise! Whom are you angry on? You crib at everything! Can't I hit my own children? You aren't able to stand us since we came here. Why do you quarrel, Aunt? Why can't you sit in peace? Everyone points me out. My brother would never have let me face this day. It would have been better if I died along with him. I wouldn't have to face these insults today! I didn't want the television for this reason. Where is Sailu? Hey Sailu! I asked the television to be turned on as I was bored. A death happened in this house, my dear. If you turn on the television and laugh, people would talk bad about us. Sorry, Uncle. That's alright. Sai, take your sister out and buy her something. Go dear. Why don't you go along? Chitti, ask her. Why don't you come along? - Me? - Yeah. I will. But where to? Let's go to the bakery. Get down, kid. - Want to have an ice cream, Chitti? - Yes! Take them there. - I'll have two of them. - Have three. - OK. - Take here. - You have them too. - OK. - Come. - Sandhya. Let them go. You come here. Come. This is ours. - Yeah. - Oh! - What will you have? - I don't want anything. The sandwiches here are great. - I'm not hungry. - Then take it home. Hey! Two sandwiches. Special ones! Pack them. Turn on the fan! It's hot. Sandhya. Which college are you studying in? - Krishnaveni college. - Krishnave... Do you know Karunakar sir? Yes. He is my Physics lecturer. He is a member of my chit fund. [chuckles] Sandhya... Will you give me your number? - Huh? - Whatsapp... Well, after Grandpa's death, I'm creating a family group. I thought its good if everyone is added. 95... 80... 11... 534. [chuckles] Why is it that only we both exist in the group? I'll add everyone else by the evening. Adding Mother is pending. Aunt uses an old phone. I should go myself to asskept... I mean accept it. And... "Give some attention to the innocent kid who is behind you" "Give me some attention, Chinni" "My problems would disappear if you are with me" "Give me some attention, Chinni" "You look so sweet" "Come to my rescue" "Your looks don't leave my mind" "Step into my house as my lady luck" "Short girl, you are my only chance" "Oh short girl, you are stuck to my heart" "Short girl, you are my only chance" "Oh short girl, you are stuck to my heart" "Set into my life soon" "Our pair would be perfect like snacks with toddy" "I'm unable to find words" "You are yummy like the masala smell in meat curry" "I'll ward off any evil eye on us" "I've prayed to the holy Sammakka and Sarakka" "Short girl, you are my only chance" "Oh short girl, you are stuck to my heart" "Short girl, you are my only chance" "Oh short girl, you are stuck to my heart" - Hey! - Yeah. - Where is mine? - Ask Uncle. Yes. You ate everything. Nothing for me? Ask your grandson. He is coming behind. Hey, how are you Shakuntala? Thank god she didn't see it. - This is for Sandhya. - What did you get, dear? Mom, brother bought me three ice creams. Is it? Good, come. This is for Sandhya. [humming] [whistling] Hey boy... you got this piece of bread from there? Oh damn! Boy, who adds onion in bread? Try it with tea. Its so tasty. Want some? Have it yourself if thats so tasty! OK, I will. Stop here. - Get the goats down. - Please come. - Namasthe Uncle. - Namasthe. - Are these the ones? - Yeah. Careful. - Chitti! The goats are here. - A goat! A goat! - I'll hold it. - OK, take it. [sighs in anger] Carry on. Sandhya! Place it there, dear. That too. Uncle, would Ailaiah win or would it be Narayana? It would be Narayana. - Is it? - Yes. - All ready? - Yes. - Get that. - Is everything here? - Yes. - Brother, please come down. Put this, we have another bottle too. Oh! An imported bottle! Narayana is bagging it! Huh? You! Eh? Why is he pouring so much of it? Psch! [praying] Uncle, though I wasn't here till now, I'm doing the ritual grandly. Brother, I request you. Come soon. [crow cawing] [all laughing] Ah! It's here. [crow cawing] Why is he acting strange? [indistinct murmering] - We did it all so good. - Please come brother. - Bro, why don't you pray once again? - OK. Ah! Oh my! [crow cawing] [indistinct chatter] Seenu, the old man is very angry on someone. - What do you think? - Crazy man. Did Grandpa tell you something? Neither Grandpa told me anything, nor did I to him. - I didn't say anything. - What's this? Oh dear! How many crows I see! The loving son-in-law has offered and here come all the crows of the country! He was visiting every week when he was alive. And he has bought a fancy imported bottle for show off. Hey! It's you who is into show off. Stop your dual faceted acting. I offered sincerely. And why didn't the crow come if you did it sincerely. Father, what are you talking? Please be calm... [all] Why do you hit him? Wait... Everyone is watching. Why did you do that? It's shameful! Oh its shameful now? Wasn't it shameful at the time of last ritual? Since he came both you mother and son are in his team. Are you crazy? Why are you shouting? You are angry now but not when your husband was blamed. - You idiotic woman! - Father! Don't hit a woman you wastrel! Talk to me like a man! - Come aside mother. - Here comes the man. I had to wet my pants seeing him. I'll hit you if you talk wrong. - You will hit me? - Yes I will. - You deserve it. - Wait! [indistinctive shouting] Stop! Are you humans? You're not worried that the crow didn't come. The entire village might learn this from you! Go to your places! - Uncle! Where is he? - I'm here. You asked me to perform my duty as a son-in-law and I did. Enough of what you did here. - Come, girl. Come Sandhya. - Narayana! Narayana. It's disgraceful for you if such an indecent person is in your village. Come, Sandhya. - [indistinct chatter] - Enough. You can leave now. [indistinct chatter] - Why did he do that? - What can we do? Damn... Me and Komuraiah used to play on this hill in our childhood days. You brought me here again now, son. [laughing] Have some more, Grandpa. Yeah. [groans in happiness] What is the problem between these two? Who are you talking about? Father and Narayana Uncle. To hell with their tiff. It just doesn't get solved. Your father never listens the other won't give up. What happened between those too? [groans] It's something that happened 20 years ago. Leave it. Just leave it. When would this quarrel come to an end if we leave it? Tell me now. [takes a deep breath] Alright. An year after Lakshmi was married, on the occasion of Dussera... Son-in-law and Lakshmi came home. - How are you? - We are doing fine. - Is the baby good? - Yeah. I visited the hospital. Are youe ating on time? - How are you father? - There comes my son-in-law! - Father! - Sailu, kiss your Aunt! - Sailu! - He kissed me. Uncle! If my wife conceives a daughter, I'll get her married to your Grandson. - God bless you. - [all laughing] Why don't you sit inside? I'm fine here. Let them enjoy. - Take this. It's soft. - It's good. Let's cover the next block after this. What do you say? Yeah, right. - How is the celebration going, Komuraiah? - Yeah. It's on. Ailaiah! The Sarpanch is here. What else? We sacrificed the goat. We are distributing the offering. - Here it is. - Good. - How are you? - You keep talking. - Come in and have a peg. - Not today. [indistinct chatter] - Feel like home. - You have come home. Have it. We also have other houses to visit. I'll come after it's done. - They invite us but don't come in. - Of course yes! - Brother... brother... - I have to visit other houses too. They would feel bad if I stop here. Your brother-in-law is alone. Ask him to wait for a couple of minutes. [indistinct chatter] We have to get going. - Not possible. - You come at least. Ask him to sit for a while. What did you say? Yeah it's right. Lets go. OK then. Look at them. The Sarpanch would simply not listen. It's festival. They would come. Brother! You didn't have dinner. Why are you serving dinner? He needs a drink! Brother-in-law, hand me your glass. - I don't want it. - Have one. - Enough of drinks. Leave it. - Hey! Sister, serve me that bone. Brother-in-law... It's a bit spicy but the piece tastes very good. I checked. The only one piece was served to Brother. Doesn't Brother-in-law eat without a good bone? I'll get you some bones tomorrow. You can devour the lot. Hey. What do you think of me? Do you think I'm here for bones? Why are you so angry on him, Brother-in-law? Oh no! What else do you expect? You talk to outsiders for hours and ignore the son-in-law of the house? - No Brother-in-law... - Why are you creating a ruckus? What? You say I'm creating a ruckus? If these wastrels don't know how to treat their Brother-in-law... Don't you know how to take care of your husband, you idiotic lady! But they didn't belittle you! You dare argue with me? Hey, what did you do? Hey, let go! Brother! Wait... You hit my pregnant sister. What kind of a human are you? You idiot! Don't you know to respect elders? Are you humans? He is drunk. - I plead you, pardon him. - Stop it! Don't plead me. You called me for the festival and hit me! Is this your respect? If I come back to this house ever again alive... I'll change my family name. Yeah change it. Son! Narayana! - Stop him! - Son! Narayana! - Is he the only Brother-in-law ever? - Narayana! - Let him go! - Brother. He left angrily and never came back. I don't know how long would this continue. And this is the situation now. I have to do something. I have an idea. Listen to me. Let's get a flex board with your Father and Uncle sitting like friends. Let's tie that before your Uncle's house. That would work out for sure. No one can help you then. - Save me god! - What is happening? I'm unable to stand, son. - Come in. - My legs ache! I was wondering who would it be after Komuraiah. You're the one next, beauty! You bloody tongue! May you be damned! You've grown like a bull. - Why do you wish me to die? - Rajesh! It all started when the bird didn't turn up on Komuraiah's death rituals. My legs hurt after I stood for long. The same happened on the fifth day. I'm unable to do anything. Komuraiah's death is proving fatal to me. [man]: Oh my... Ravi... It just doesn't end. The motion is like water now. Give me some strong medicine. Didn't I tell you not to eat spicy food? I promise you, I didn't! Stop it now. I saw your plate full of pieces on the fifth day. How do you expect to be cured? What do I do? He asked us not to cook at home that day. How can I see the curry and not eat it? How do you expect to be cured if you eat so much? [groans] Sailu, your Grandfather's death is proving dangerous to me. It's non-stop since morning. - Your friend is bed ridden. - What happened? He is behaving crazy. - I'm scared. - Don't worry. I'm coming. - [old woman groans] - Damn you Narsi! Neither Grandpa told me anything, nor did I to him. Narsi! Hey Narsi. How are you feeling? Neither Grandpa told me anything, nor did I to him. See. Always remembering Grandpa. He stopped eating and doesn't open the shop. He is in a bad state. - I'm here now. - Calm down. - Don't worry. - Look how he changed. He used to stitch throughout the day. Now he won't get out of the bed. [murmers] Look Rajesh! Don't you dare say anything against my Grandfather again! Your Grandpa is the real culprit! Ah! Why do you hit me? You hit me if I say the truth? Hey stop! [commotion] - Hey! - What happened now? You shameless fellow. What did you say? Stop, you idiot! - Do you have any shame? - You stop first! - Stand here and talk to me if you're a man - I won't! Stop you! Hey! You dare talk bad about my Gradpa? Your Grandpa is the real culprit! He is the reason for everything. Damn you! What did you say? Stop there! Rajesh! I'll bash you up! Don't come closer! - Hey mind it! - Sorry, auntie! You short fellow! Stop there! Stop there! be a man and stop there! I'll kill you! What the hell are you talking, you moron! - I said the truth. - What is it? Your Grandpa is the real culprit! - You say bad about Grandpa! - Stop! Why are you fighting? Ask him! He is talking bad about my Grandpa! Why are you concerned about his Grandfather? I will talk for sure. - Look at him! - Wait now. Why are we here if you have to fight on the streets? You wait. You tell me what's your problem? Entire village knows the crow didn't touch Komuraiah's offering. That is right. They took is easy and dispersed to their homes. Grandpa was angry and is haunting the village. Look what he is saying, uncle! Why will my Grandpa haunt the village? Will he talk just anything? - I will talk. - Why? How many lives should be lost because of you? What is the proof that my Grandpa is haunting the village? - You need proof? - Yeah. - You need proof? - [seller on speaker] Stop it idiot! Rajayya, come here. Look at him. Healthy Rajayya has become a skeleton. He is having loose motions. Look at her! She was like an actress! How is she now? Look at him! Look at him! Looks like he would perish any day. Look how his wife is troubled! Would he be alive till Grandpa's 11th day? Oh no! Give me two minutes! You don't get it! Today it's them, tomorrow it you, then the entire village. Then the entire village would be so dead! Look, don't mislead the villagers. I'll hack you to pieces! Why are you so worked up? What wrong did he say? Why are the village heads silent? Are you calling the Panchayat? So be it! We sure will! You have to come to Panchayat. You Father, Your Uncle and the whole village should attend it! - Call them then. - We shall! - Let's see who wins. - We sure will! - Call them! - People are dying! What do the village heads say? Yeah. Even after what that wastrels did, I completed my duties going an extra mile. Now, I don't have anything to do with that village. How can you say that? You married our village dame and say you don't have anything to do with the village Whatever you say, I don't want to see them or enter that village. [Lakshmi sobbing] How can you say that? You are a gentleman. Lets us sit in a discussion. We will question them. We all are here to ask them. Look here gentleman, don't ask me the same thing again and again. I'm deeply hurt. - If you ask me the same one more time - Huh? I might not give you the same respect anymore. [Lakshmi sobbing] Why are you crying? Is the respect your brothers showed the other day not enough? Stop the crying now! Stop crying, Lakshmi. You are still crying! Can't you hear me? If you talk about them in this house again, Its only one of us who would stay in this house. Calm down, Lakshmi. Why are you crying mother? You've been away from your parents' house for 20 years. They don't remember any of that. They just remember their tiffs and ego. Who knows? Even my husband could turn out to be this way. I wonder how many years I would have to be away from this house. Let them talk, we shall see what they have to talk. Let us hear them out first. - We shall say what we have to. - We shall ask them questions. OK. Why don't you start? Let them have tea first. Everything would be alright. - Its getting late. - Don't worry. Enough of your stare. I need my money. - Can't move my limbs, I'm weak. - Come forward. Ah! I wish god calls me to him soon. Stop your whining. Talk about what is happening! The whole village knows about it. Why ask me again? So you say that the old man Komuraiah has possessed you. Is it? That is right. - What about us then? - We shall discuss that. Is that all? What else? Its evident that the old man is haunting the village. Ask them how can they solve it. Let's discuss everything. You wait. Nothing waits in my condition! Ailaiah, tell us what you have to say. I'm struggling to protect my respect. What can I say? Narayana, what about you? What do I say? I have given a feast with ten lambs the other day. These wastrels caught my collar and insulted me badly. Ask him who caught whose collar first! Wait, son. If he did it, would you catch the collar of your brother-in-law? - Is this right? - Ask him! My brother-in-law is 60 years old. We still fear him. You should bear the anger of your brother-in-law. Ah! Brother-in-law from heavens! Look at his arrogant talk! Don't talk rubbish, brother-in-law. Who the hell is talking rubbish? I say it's him! [indistinct shouting] Shut up! [indistinct shouting] Stop it everyone! - Look at them! - Wait! How can we understand anything if you all talk at once? Not like that... [indistinct shouting] Wait. If you want to fight here, why call this panchayat? You fight. We'll leave. These wastrels need to learn from that boy how to treat the son-in-law of the house. You should have some respect at least for the son-in-law of the house. I rejected their proposal but he stood at the gate till I said yes. Now that is called respect! Indeed. Let us talk. Please sit down. [no voice] Is everyone here? - We did discuss. - Wait. Everyone hear me out. All our village heads have come to a decision. You all must abide by that. - Isn't it right? - [all]: Of course! That's how it should be You continue. Why would we say no to you? Ailaiah, your brother-in-law is elder to you. Shake hands with him. - Do I get my lost respect with that? - [all]: Take it easy! It's only your brother-in-law! Let bygones be bygones. But now the issue has crossed your house and is troubling the village now. So, the panchayat has come to a decision. First learn what Komuraiah's soul wants. Do anything but make the crow eat the offering on the 11th day. That is right. If the bird doesn't touch the offering, Then your family has to face the punishment given by the panchayat. This is the decision of the Panchayat. - What happened? - Nothing, aunty. - Give me a high five, bro. - What is a High five? - Hit it this way. - Is it, do it again. - Again? - Yes, do it. Okay... Okay. You should apply oil for a healthy hair. Need to talk to you. - What? - Need to talk to you. - I will wait outside. - Okay. Sandhya! All okay? Tell me if you need a charger, will ask my friends to get it. Not that... I never thought I would come to grandma's house again. Oh! It's nothing. Thank you so much. It's alright, don't mention it. Ah! Selfie! "It's awesome! My heart is soaring with happiness..." "Coz, I am among my beloved ones, playing around like a little lamb" "Shy! I am feeling shy" "While I dream, that I am sitting besides you like the bridegroom" "I would like to remain like the mehendi on your hands" "Though we fight or fall out, I will listen to what ever you say forever" "Short girl, you are my only chance" "Oh short girl, you are stuck to my heart" "Short girl, you are my only chance" "Oh short girl, you are stuck to my heart" - Eat more. - I'm full. - Chitti! - What? Look here. Aunty! For me also. - That's my plate. - Hey... - My plate, give it back... give it back. - I took it first. Leave it. She is younger than you, right? Give it to her... - I'll serve in another plate. - Okay. - Brother-in-law... - Get lost. Chitti reminds me of our Lakshmi in her childhood. Sister! Do you recognise that plate? Of course I do, coz that's mine. - Sandhya! - Yes. As a child, if some else ate in that plate other than your mum... she used to roll on the ground, weeping. I took a lot of beatings in my childhood, because of Lakshmi. Here, take a look. My God! Who did that to you, uncle? Who else, your elder uncle Ailaiah did it. Why? In their childhood, on the eve of Bathukamma... along with his siblings, Ailiah went to the lake to immerse Bathukamma. It was a festive day, the place was crowded... and she was a little kid. She went some where playing around. When Ailiah returned his sister was missing. He asked his younger brother, 'where is our sister'? For which this fellow bluntly replied, 'I don't know... As his sister went missing... he was inconsolable... He searched all over the village. Ailiah thrashed him black and blue... and did that to him, because he let go off her. If sister is not to be seen even for a minute, Ailiah used to worry a lot. Such rapport they had... but God broke them apart. You must speak the truth. Komuraiah! Start talking... Your daughters, sons... your son-in-law, everyone is here. Then why isn't the bird touching the offering, huh? Do you have any unfulfilled wish? If yes, let us no. Or accept the offering. Komuraiah! Tell us. Do you have any unfulfilled wish? Let us know. Hmm! Move aside, woman. He has some unfulfilled wish. Come on pray, one after the other. Ailiah! You first. Father, you had a wish to offer a goat to Goddess Maisamma, right... I'll do it after the 11 days ritual. No, he is not moving it. Her must be worried about his younger son as he is a drunkard. Mogili! Pray that you'd quit drinking. How is this ritual related to my drinking habit? - Why don't you do it? Living to booze! - Keep quite. Hmm! I will quit after the 11th day ritual, happy now? What's wrong if you quit on the fourth day? Pray that you'd quit right now, do it. Stop it. I will. - No use. - Damn it! Father... I'll visit Sammakka and Sarakka's abode... I'll offer jaggery equal to my weight, please move it. No use! Uncle, I'll prepare fish curry for you on the 11th day, please move it. - Any thing you want so say, say it. - Okay. [voice muted] No! No use. - Hell no! Komuraiah is arrogant... - Good God! What's wrong? He is strongly hurt. - There's some thing else... - What next? Or else, he would've moved it by now. How sad you must be, dear brother...! You didn't even have water at least. What is bothering you, my brother... Dear brother! Dear brother! I understand your pain, but... Do you know why only crows should feast on the offering? Among all the living beings who can't see few things with both their eyes... The crow is capable to see those things with a single eye... and is blessed to convey messages to them. That's why they roam around the burial grounds like lord Shiva does... feast on the offerings and... covey messages to the departed souls. If the crows won't touch the offering, the souls would roam the earth in agony. - What was the old man's name? - Komuraiah. For Komuraiah's soul to rest in peace... on the 11th day, crows must accept the offering. Rest is up to you. - But, that's the whole issue. - Yes. - Grandpa, tea. - No dear. Thanks. Why don't you tell them about yesterdays discussion? About which discussion? Once, aunt Lakshmi came on Dussera eve while she was pregnant... grandpa made me kiss her womb you remember. Foolish! How would they remember it till now? Despite praying relentlessly, did he get pleased? - Tell me. - Okay! Okay! - What do we do now? - You must say. - Narayana? - Yes, uncle! Ailaiah! While my brother was alive he used to tell me one thing. About what? I want to tell you all about that... no one must get offended after that. What's there to get offended... everyone wants father-in-law's soul to depart peacefully. Tell us what he used to speak about. Well son... He wished if Lakshmi had a daughter, she should be married to our Sai. May be that's what is bothering him. What's this non sense? Finally you diverted the issue on to my daughter? - Grandpa! - Yes. You think you can say what ever you want? Now keep quiet. What's wrong in what brother Anji said? Even I have grand son and grand daughter... Won't I be happy if they marry each other. May be, my brother also wished for the same. Dear brother! Brother! Dear brother! Because I was away from you for 20 years, did you wish to see me in my daughter by marrying her into this house? So much love you had for me in your heart! Though he didn't see you since you were born... So much love your grandpa had for you! Narayana! You must marry her off to some one some day. Though you marry her off in all grandeur... she would be considered a daughter-in-law, but not a daughter. If you send her to this house, it's like your daughter is in your own home. Think about it. Narayana! Now the ball is in your court. [women whining] Hmm! If that was his wish, let's do it. Your in law's names should not be at the bottom, their names should be on the top and ours at the bottom. If this work is done, we can distribute wedding cards peacefully. Let's go, we are getting late. Let's go... Let's go. - Better if we start from there. - From that corner till here. - Start marking. - Yes, start. - Mark for both. - Yes. - Mark properly. - Brother-in-law... Why are you building the grave in the middle of the farm? Father likes this place a lot, it must be built here itself. But, if we build it near the well, it would be at a corner and beneficial. No... No, it must be built here itself, only then father would be happy. - Mason, you go ahead. - [all] Yes, do it. - Mark it from here. - He is right. Okay, sir. - Chitti! Want ice-cream? - Hmm! I want two. Take three, okay. Go. - Sandhya! - Yes. - Want to have tea? - Tea! - But you offer soft drinks, right? - Soft drink? To whom did I offer? Oh yeah! You gave her your hanky while she was crying, arranged special chair for her... sent her Thums up to drink! How did you forget so soon? [smiles shyly] What was her name, brother-in-law? Why talk about that now? Goodness! Feeling shy! - Nothing like that. - Why don't you tell? Bro, once check this. Sandhya! What's wrong? We think our elders think about our future while they are alive... but, now I realised that they love us even more after they die. I never got a chance to call him as grandpa. Brother-in-law, I miss our grandpa a lot. You live with our grandpa... You are so lucky! I missed that chance. [breaks into tears] OBITUARY GAJULA KOMURAIAH - Come, sit son. - We have finished the duty. - Swaroopa, give them some water to drink. - OK. There they come. They look so cute together. Maybe my brother died to unite them. He would have been very happy if he here alive today. He loved his grandchildren a lot. What have you got, Chitti? - Ailayya! Ailayya! - Biscuits. Yeah. We got the bricks and cement. The men would start work if you give them some advance. Listen, get the money from the almirah. Listen, when would you ask them? You brother and brother-in-law are right here. Everyone is here. Why don't you ask? Wait, I'll talk. Mogili... what is it? Well Brother... how can we build the grave in the middle of the farm? Tell us what is on your mind. What do we tell you, Brother-in-law? We are planning to sell our part of the farm and build a house in Surat. Who would purchase it if you build a grave there? Huh? You're planning to sell the farm? What Mogili? Don't you know that father loved that place? How can you ask me not to build the grave there? Why don't you say something? Let us not talk about that. My brother gave us an advance for that land. If you build a grave there, he doesn't want to buy it. What do you have to say now? What kind of a person are you? Is this what you do attending a death? Mind your words Brother-in-law! Cousin, don't you know how to respect elders? Oh! She is hurt about the words I spoke about her brother. I wonder where did this love go all these years. What are you talking? You started again when everything cooled down! Look, I've been noticing you since we came here. Why are you talking as you wish? This is our family matter. It's better you stay away from this. - Or else you would lose your respect. - Huh? Mogili, why are you silent? Can't your wife respect anyone? She is raging on to everyone! What decency is this? Oh! And you teach us decency! Where was your decency when you fought tooth and nail before the village? You're talking now like a gentleman! Shut up. What the hell are you speaking? Are you a woman? Hey! Careful with your words! Who the hell are you to ask me to mind my words at my own house? Get lost! Oh no! They are killing my brother. Why do you just stand as a spectator? They all have united. Why don't you talk anything? The grave would be built under the tree. I will see who can stop it. - I will see how you'd do that! - I take up the challenge. I will go to any extent for this. - Go to hell. - I will if required. Stop! Stop quarreling! Are you humans? It is a shame! It was Ailaiah and Narayana till yesterday and now you are fighting for the land. Cool down. Is anyone concerned about the crow not taking the offering? Everyone is being selfish. You are not letting my brother be happy even after his death. [sobbing] After all his life, my brother didn't find even a three feet space for his grave! Just three feet of land. What kind of sons are you? Shame on you! [no voice] - Ailaiah. - One after the other hits to our family. Ailaiah! I hope everyone is here. Tell them what all of us have decided, gentleman. Tell them. We don't know what you'd do. If the crow doesn't claim the offering tomorrow... You and your family would be expelled from this village. This the decision of the Panchayat. - Its up to you now. - That's all. What is this childishness, Sai? Listen, get up. [Sailu sobbing] I can't bear this guilt. I made a mistake. I will disclose everything at home. The situation at home is not good now. Wait for sometime. Leave it. How can I leave it? I used my Grandpa's death for my selfish motive. I always thought of clearing my debts. But I forgot about my Grandpa. [sobbing] Grandpa is dead. He is dead. I can never see him again! Never again! I miss him so much! A lot! [sobbing] Grandpa!
