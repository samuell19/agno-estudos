A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES The characters and situations presented here, and the names used in this show are fictitious. Any similarities to names, characters, stories or other events resembling actual persons or situations are purely coincidental. Juancho! Juan! WHERE ARE YOU, MY FISH? Isn't that car following us? You see it? The black one. Do you see it? -Wait here. -What? Charly, what are you doing? Wait, Charly! Hey, why are you following me, pal? Don't mess with my family, Charly. That's all I'm saying. -What are you talking about? -No? Stay away from my son, asshole. Don't be such a coward. -What are you talking about? -Oh, yeah? Don't touch me, bitch. I'm gonna prove you were involved in my son's attempted kidnapping. Stay out of it, asshole. That's all I'm saying. Fuck off. Not all of your misfortune is my fault, idiot. Leave me alone! Stay away from my woman, and stay away from my son, okay? Let's go. What did he want? Haven't you heard about Uncle Manín's latest fuck up? -No. -He kidnapped Juancho's son. He obviously thought it was me. I had no idea. Listen, princess. If we're going to Manín's, we have to be two steps ahead. Don't worry, Charly, Manín needs to really believe you're the same Charly you've always been. Agent Contreras, how are you? It's Yeimy Montoya. -Did you get my email? -Yes. Yeah, I got it, but in the photos of that woman who tried to take Emilio, you can't see her face. She knows how to hide herself. -But my men will keep investigating. -But what's the problem? Come on, if this woman won't show her face, there are many other ways to find someone. If you don't mind, let us do our job. I'll call you when we know more. -You're late, idiot. -Yeah, we had to make a detour. -You and your fucking excuses. -No, Manín, it's true. Juancho was following us. Ah, yeah? That asshole finally woke up? Well, that creep thinks I helped kidnap his son. But I imagine that was you, or what? I just wanted to scare the crap out of Garfio. And it seems like it worked. I told you I wanted to drive her crazy. Well, what about you? Are you going to insist on all that shit about being a saint? About wanting to change. Ah, well, you know what? The more I try, the less they believe me. I don't care. Princess. A drink over here, come on. Right? But why would you wanna turn the page? If you can carry on being the same wonderful piece of shit as always. Ah, easy, okay. You never change, right? It's not me who's changed. No, wait. I won't deny it, I did try, but in the end, I realized, it's the same shit. My kids hate me, I look for work, but get humiliated. Screw it. Tell me who's humiliating you, and we'll drop them. Hey, easy, Uncle. Don't mess around. Okay? Let them know who they're messing with, man. Right. We'll show them. Let's put an end to this asshole Juancho. You've been really close to him for years. Let's sort him out. Don't think about it. Just do it. Hey, no, wait. Don't touch him. -Ah, fine. -What's gotten into you? I don't understand you. Why are you defending the people who have harmed us? Because I'll look after that little beauty. Like you will with Yeimy. Let's bring him down slowly so that bastard feels twice the amount of pain. That guy is what Yeimy will lose last. I'm warning you. Promise me. Don't touch him. Leave him alone. Is it all true, what you're saying? Are you up for anything, then? -Anything. -Ah, I knew it! I told you, no? It was all a show. This crook's never gonna change. It must run in the family, right? We'll show everyone what we're made of, right? Cheers, then. -Dina. -Yes? Take this outside, we're gonna celebrate. Tell Alergia to set up the barbecue. It's here. It's here. Good afternoon. Excuse me. The administrator? -Do you know who I can talk to? -Her. Thanks. Good afternoon, excuse me. -Do you have a minute? -Yeah. -Nice to meet you. Yeimy Montoya. -Hi. How are you? Somebody tried to kidnap my son yesterday here at the mall. -No, but it wasn't us. -No. Don't be silly. It has nothing to do with you. But you have a camera right outside of the shop. That might help me identify who the woman is. I know there are certain areas in the mall that have blind spots, where the cameras can't see. But your camera there might be perfect. She's the one who tried to take him? Yes. The criminals sent this to me when they took him. So, basically, could you let me, please, look at the recordings, to see if we can send the police those images and help catch her? It's her. I'll send this to my team so they can identify her right away. -Please. -If she's not identified. Please, Detective. We need to know what that woman wants and, especially, if she's linked to Charly Cruz. Yes. Perdomo, I'm sending you some information. Let's talk. I'm glad you came, my boy. How are we doing with those battles? Búho, I'm not here for that. I need your help. I need someone you fully trust to do a job for me. Ah, a job! Exciting. Why are you talking like a thief? -Ah? What job? -I need to follow Charly Flow. -For what? -What do you mean, "for what"? That bastard's messing with what is most special to me. I need to know what he's up to, what he's doing. -That's why I need someone. -Listen, Juancho! You sound like Charly, pal. Who sounds like Charly? Not at all, brother. I just don't want that guy messing up my life or my family's. Are you sure he's connected to what happened to Emi? Well, it's pretty odd, right? He gets out of jail, Mrs. Ligia's restaurant gets blown up, my son gets snatched up… They took my son! I know, brother, but don't be naive, man. He's not gonna leave jail just to blow up your mom. Well. Let's suppose you're right, brother. What do you want to do? What will you do? I want that guy… I want that bastard to rot in prison, Búho. That's what I want. For him to rot in prison. Love. Juancho! Because you're my obsession You're my fixation What's up? Why did you turn it off? That song's a hit. The lyrics… ah! It's hot, it's sexy. What's up, brother? Don't you like it? I stumbled across it on Yeimy's computer. -She didn't wanna show me. -And? What do you mean, "and"? What's she hiding? Hiding what? The song still needed to be edited. The girl wanted to polish it up. You know how much of a perfectionist Yeimy is, man. You're kind of jealous. No, but you know how Yeimy writes music, drawing on her own experiences, how she thinks, feels, lives, dreams. Have you heard the lyrics? How she expresses things? I feel like it's for someone else. "Someone else"? What does that mean? Someone who isn't you? Who, then? Ah, don't tell me, Juancho. You think she wrote it for Charly. Buddy, you're barking up the wrong tree. All Yeimy feels for Charly is hatred and resentment for what he did to her. -Nothing else. -No, that's called obsession. It's the same for him with her. That's why he's going after her, that's why he's on top of her. Just to unsettle you both, brother. Look how she's made you feel. It's not because she feels anything. Do you remember when she was Tammy Andrade? -Sure. -Right. -Look. -What's up, man? -What's up, Juan? -All good? -What's up, bro? -All good? Talk soon! Well then, when I discovered that Tammy was actually Yeimy, she invited me to her apartment, opened this sliding door, and in her room, boom! There were so many photos, images of Charly Flow's life everywhere. She said it was to study him. I mean, to take him down, but she's already done that. Why hasn't she stopped thinking about him? Why is he still in her head? Well, the best way to find out something is to go and ask, so ask her. But that's another thing, Búho. I don't want her to think that I don't trust her, you get me? We have enough problems. All I need to know is why she wrote that song. Or who she wrote it for. In short, why did she hide it from me? It's all I need to know. You ran off. Come here, man. Did you follow my mom in the commune? What? Are you following me or what? No. Nobody's following you, pal. She saw you. Luckily, she thought you were a ghost. But you can't do that, buddy. What do you want? For everyone to find out you're alive? What shady stuff are you up to? I guess that's what you want, no? I wanted to see her close up. That's what love does, it turns us into idiots. It happened to you, yeah? Who was it you fell in love with? Tammy or Yeimy? Which of the two did you fall in love with? Or was it both of them? Because they're both skinny girls. But there's something about that skinny girl. I didn't fall in love with Yeimy or Tammy, or anyone. I just wanted a good time. Nothing else. Pay attention, nephew. I want to sort something out with your mom. I want to wipe her boyfriend, that drunk, off the planet. Okay? Fine by me. We agree on that. That guy isn't fit to even lace my mom's boots. But, yeah. We have to do it slowly, calmly. Because if not… she worships him. You know what she's like. Just like you did with my dad, no? You get rid of that asshole. Get your mom to turn on him. Okay? For your mom… there can only be one man. And that's me. There you go. But are you thinking of revealing yourself one day or what? Get rid of that creep, I'll take care of the rest. I'll sort it out. Look, Manín, I've never come here before because you're part of the past I want to leave behind. But today, I had to. Because I've come personally to ask you to stop appearing. If I have to bathe in herbs, or say prayers, I'll do whatever I have to. Because you've terrified me for so many years. And now that you're dead and buried, I won't allow you to carry on filling me with fear. I'm finally happy in life. I finally have a man who respects me, who loves me. And you're not going to mess with that. So do me a favor… No, what favor? I demand you to go back to hell where you belong. You, yes, honey, Alcides, may God hold you in His glory. So, what, my love? This is a celebration and it will go on for a long time. I'm driving, Manín. I can't drink. Thanks. Well, if you can't handle drinking, stay here. No. Wait. Wait, she's got to take me to Medellín. -Careful then, right. -Yeah? For what? What do you mean for what? For work. Don't you want me to prepare for when you start laundering? I have to sort out those gangs that are active in the commune, who think nobody's in control. Their little holiday is over, bro. When you've finished the cleaning, we'll start laundering. Uncle, you know I no longer have Excelsior, right? And if a producer ends up calling me, I'll be just another artist. You no longer have Excelsior, but you have a really big company. What about the one you started in prison? Hey, whoa, wait a minute. That's a foundation. We work with a charity… Which charity? You and what charity? Think about it, Charly. -It's perfect for laundering. -No, Uncle. Uncle, wait. Things aren't like that. The pigs are after me. They're watching everything I do, as well as everything I don't do. Even better. Just flash some cash under their noses. Who'd doubt that Charly the saint… is covering up for the devil? And you, babe, help him with the foundation. Everything legit, just how I like it. I've already started. It's in the works. Play with your charity. Show the world what you want them to see. But we know the reality… Let's take advantage of it. -What's the problem? -No problem, Uncle. I'll sort it out, then. You know what, nephew? Get going. We'll talk later. Hey. Charly, don't let me down. Because don't forget, we're family. Right? Be quick with that José job. If not, I'll kill him. I'll sort it out. It's all good. Hey, come here. Do you believe him? Well, they've slammed several doors in his face, humiliated him. But what's important is that you believe him. I just don't know. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. Don't leave him alone. Just let me know. Bye. Bye, skinny. You were perfect. I hope those congratulations don't come from one actor to another. Look, tell me right now if you believe me or not. To see if we should go our separate ways. Do you know what that rat did? He messed with the only good thing in my life, those folks in jail. Calm down. This is a test. Manín knows full well how important that prison program is to you. So we can't ignore his idea to use it. Okay. So, what? What do I say? That I had no idea that this rat was laundering cash through my foundation? I launder cash, Silvia, and lots of it. You know who'd believe me? Nobody. Let's cross that bridge later. Don't spoil what you've achieved. Fuck. Son! Son? Charly? Nothing is by chance with your son, Mrs. Ligia, sorry to tell you. What did you want with Yeimy at Surround? And he called me beforehand. Mrs. Ligia, I know that because he's your son, you don't believe what's going on here, but he's hiding something. Ah, fuck. Why did you tell me that story about Manín destroying your life and all that? What do you mean? Because it's not a story. You were going to do something stupid and I don't want anything bad to happen. Why does it matter to you what happens to me? The only thing you want is to put an end to Manín. What do you care about everyone else? Well, maybe not everyone else. But you, yeah. Charly, I've spent many years defending your case and after a while, I, well, became fond of someone. Ah, fond of someone? Yeah. Well, besides being your lawyer, I'm also your ally, or no? Sure. An ally who told me lies to carry out her own plan. -What a great ally. -That's how it started. But I later understood. Manín killed your dad, took your son, and took everything from me. We need to make him pay. That's clear to me. Charly. -You need to give me your gun. -You know what? No. What if the next person to lose it is you and not me? Don't make that face, princess. I'm just protecting you from yourself. Just like you said. As allies, no? How's Mrs. Ligia? So, how are you, Mom? Is everything okay? -Have you been drinking? -A little, not a lot. Guess what? Tomorrow… I'll sign a contract with Mike Rivera. Are you not pleased? Look, what are you doing with this? Come on, give me that. Give it to me. Don't touch it. -No. -Give it to me. No, why do you have guns in the house? You know I hate them. I got it after what happened in the restaurant. -That's it. Give it to me. -But why? -Why? -To defend myself, Mom. -Yeah? From who? -What do you mean? From who? You think everyone's happy I'm out of jail? -Who's not happy? -I don't know. Don Édgar, for example. Don Édgar? But he's in jail. Mom, that man's a monster with many heads. There are many people still out there. Give it to me. One second. Are they involved in what happened at the restaurant? Well, yeah. Among other things. Come. Listen to me. No. Is that why you want us to leave the country? Mom, because of that and many other reasons. I owe that guy cash. But I'll get it and sort it out. That'll be it. Don't worry. Give me that. Promise me you'll sort it out. I won't promise. I'll swear to you, Mom. Everything will be fine. I've got a job that I like now. Goodbye debts, goodbye problems. It'll all be fine. I swear. Give it to me. Promise me everything will be fine. And you won't get into trouble. That's right, Mom. In the name of God. Amen. Well, my love. I couldn't sit and do nothing. -What? -I followed Charly today. -What? -Yeah. -And what happened? -No. He caught me and I had to stop. Juan, you said not to do that because it's dangerous. -But it's the first thing you do. -I know. But it's just… Listen. I want him out of our lives. It will happen, love, but by being careful. We have a boy to raise. Charly will be taken down by those people around him. Those crooks will be the ones to take him down. Sorry, love, I can't wait for that. I don't want him near us. -You understand? -Love. It's a question of time. The cops will catch that woman soon. They'll link her to Charly, and he'll be back in jail. But let's do things right. I don't want him near us. Please. -I don't want that. -Me neither, Juan. Believe me. But we have to be smart, because if not, we'll have problems like he has problems with everyone. -No. -Come. You and I are stronger than that, right? Yes, my love. We won't mess this up. We won't get involved. Good. If there's forgiveness It's yours to have If I hurt you, I didn't mean it I'll always remember it So, what's up, Mom? Ah, looks delicious. Perfect for working. Look. Listen to this. Baby, I'll take care of you Even if you don't want me to Baby, I'll wait for you I'll always be close to you I want this to be my first single, Mom. What do you think? It's really great, love. Very different from your old stuff. Exactly. That's what I want. I'm sure this will convince Mike to sign me no matter what. But weren't you already sure? Well, yeah. I mean, he'll sign me and this will be my first single. I love this part, Mom. Listen. Baby, I'll take care of you Even if you don't want me to Baby, I'll wait for you I'll always be close to you What's up, babe? What? My brother sent you to talk to me for him? Did you get up on the wrong side of the bed or what? Babe, no, I came because I'm worried about Erik. Why aren't you answering your phone? Why the attitude with him too? No, well, he deserves it. He started talking to Charly as if it was nothing. And you too, at home, like best friends. Right. Let's calm down, okay? Let's not talk like this. Calm down. Get me a coffee. Babe, you know that Charly and Erik are family. You too. That can't change, nothing can change that. Sure. Not even my mom's death, right? Babe! Look, I know this must be really painful, right? I'm really sorry and it's not fair, but, well, I understand Charly had nothing to do with it. Well, I mean, it wasn't him who… Sure, he had nothing to do with it, but he was involved, right? And that's enough for me. Look, I'll tell you something. Charly saved Erik's life. He saved his life in that fire at the restaurant. Ah? He risked his life to save Erik. Is that not enough, babe? Look. I know this is so hard. I also have a dad who's messed up so many times, but you can't do anything, sweetie, it's family. It's family. One must love and forgive their family. It's not worth living with so much hatred in your heart, you get me? This only hurts you, nobody else. Look at Yeimy. Do you want to be like her? Look, I don't care if you compare me to Yeimy, because I admire Yeimy. Yeimy carried on with her life despite everything Charly did to her. And for me, that's more than enough. Anything else? You're being impossible today. It was all very nice, guys. Very, very tasty. I'm happy you like it, Dad. But I came to show you something else. I have a surprise. No. No! -No! Ah, come on! -It's beautiful. I see. Dad, how could you afford this? Ah, no, well, I have savings. Well, José, for me, you have my complete blessing. Ah, boy, that means a lot to me. No, thank you, because you've been a blessing for my mom Ligia. And I'm happy you've asked her to marry you with all your gifts. So, what? When will it be? Well, no. First, I have to talk to you, then I'd have to talk to Charly, and God willing, that's it, we'll have the ceremony. Let us know, then, to get my suit ready. Great. Love, can you put some cream on me? I left it there. -Okay, boy. -It's time. Dad. Will you tell me the truth now? What savings? You haven't worked in ages. But I'm now earning good money. Dad, don't get yourself in debt, okay? Look, I'm begging you. Look at what we've just been through. Sweetie, don't work yourself up. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Don't worry. It's just, I'd do anything for Ligia. She deserves it all. Well, that's true. Besides, I've never seen her so happy. My God, look at how in love you are. Ah, sweetie, from now on, everything's going to be great. The bad times are over. Trust me. You're completely right. Besides, how could I not trust you? Everything's back to normal. Everything's great! Ah, yeah, Dad. Besides, you know what? I'm sure Mrs. Ligia will say yes, with a ring, without one, with a party, without one, whatever. Come on, give me a hug. You know how it goes, right? Of course. We're just gonna drop him. A new king is born today. The old king's dead. All good, boss, we know where those snitches are. They're the ones who are selling crack in the hood. We're going to send them a hail of bullets, boss. Boss, well? What about when the cops show up? -Just shoot, bro, at anyone. -Ah, man. Just wipe them out, bro. Very good. Blessings, my love. By the hand of God and by the claw of the devil. -With everything you've got, boy. -Look after me. The devil will look after us. -Let's go. -Give it all we've got. -See you later, sir. -Good luck. You know I have a bone to pick, and I can't bear it anymore. What? I know… what you were looking for at Surround, here on your computer. It's actually a very nice song. Are you looking at my things, Juan? No. Don't kid yourself. I'm not spying on you. I found out about the song through sheer coincidence. And, well, the truth is, it leaves nothing to the imagination. It's very clear what you're saying. What do you think I'm saying? Well… I can't get you out of my mind I don't know what to do now I don't want to picture You touching me like that I'm just waiting for the sun to rise I don't know where you're going with this. Explain yourself, because I really don't understand. Well… What are you talking about? Actually, who are you talking about? Why didn't you tell me anything, eh? Because I don't like the song. Because I don't think it's ready. No, it's not working out. And why's this song coming out just as Charly gets out? So you think this song is about Charly? -I don't know, my love. -Ah, Juan, please. Seriously, Juan? Seriously, have you gone mad? Have you forgotten how creative processes work? Juan, you know full well how a song is written. You don't have to necessarily talk about somebody's life, what happens to them, or someone you know. One can talk about a book, about a story… Oh, Juan, seriously? Oh, no. You've gone mad. Emilio! Emi! That's better. Hey, Mom, do you like it? Amazing, my love. Handsome. But in order to sign that contract, you're missing something. What? Ah, Mom, what a throwback. -Yeah? -Wow, so cool, Mom, my jacket. I thought I'd lost it. No, well, how? I wouldn't allow that. -Never, love. I fixed it… -Careful. I cleaned it. Careful. -Is that okay? -Careful. Amazing. Even better. Let me see. Now, I'm completely ready. You look just like your poster. Something like that. Something like that. But better. -Go on. -I'm all set, Mom. Well, wish me luck. I love you! I feel so bad. I couldn't tell him the truth. And why do you think you lied to Juancho? Because I'm embarrassed to have written that song. Or to have dreamed about Charly? To have felt everything you felt, and that the song is all about him. Yeimy, we have to start being open and honest. Okay. Whatever. I've started to lie to Juancho. Charly's out of jail and it's been a disaster. My life's become a disaster, I'm a disaster. And if you continue to deny it, it will be worse. Yes, ma'am. Because one thing is avoiding the truth with Juancho. And that's fine. And you feel bad. But another thing is that the root of all this is your dream about Charly. -This all started when he reappeared. -Yeimy, can you listen to yourself? Are you able to accept what your subconscious wants to tell you? Accept what? Because I have nothing to accept, Doctor! I only feel contempt for that guy. I hate him. He took the best years of my life from me. How else could I feel? I can't feel anything else. Obviously, there's something else. Look at how you're acting. Yeimy, you know that you can say what you want here. I won't judge you. But it's very important for you to tell me how you feel. But what can I say? That I'm crazy? Well, to feel anything other than contempt for Charly, after everything he did to me? I'd have to be crazy. Are you completely sure that's how you feel about him? Yes! Charly Cruz has been ruining my life since I was a little girl. I won't be his victim any longer. And I'll prove that he was involved in Emilio's attempted kidnapping. And he'll be back in prison. And he'll be out of our lives, for good this time. Why are you looking at me like that? What? No, well, I'm completely sure you'll find that woman. I'm also completely sure you'll try to put Charly back in jail. I don't know if you'll achieve it, but you'll try. What I'm not completely sure of is this desire to get him out of your life. Princess! Good morning and… Well, everything. -Mr. Charly, how are you? -Great, you? Very good too. But you know what? Mr. Rivera's busy at the moment. Ah, but why don't you give me a tour? To get to know the place, walk around. Come on. I'd love to, but I can't move from here. -I can't leave my spot. -Seriously? What a pity. You know what? I'll give myself a tour, but when I come back, let's have a coffee, okay? -Just the two of us. -Ah, Charly, I'd love to. I'll have many coffees with you, but you can't go in without authorization. They'd blame me, you understand? Yeah, but, princess, come on. I didn't tell you, but I'm here to sign with Grey Shark. -Seriously? Congrats. -Seriously. Yeah, thanks, but you need to let me through to show this amazing song to Mike, you're gonna love it. In fact, you know what? I'll give you a preview, just for you. -Yes, would you like that? -Yeah, sure. Look. Listen to this. Baby, I'll take care of you Even if you don't want me to Baby, I'll wait for you… I'll always be close, my love. -What do you think? You like it? -No, well, it's… amazing. Yeah? So? Will you help me? -Yeah? -Go on through, Mr. Charly. You're the best. I'll be back. You're the best. My love, what's all this? My God. What a great start. What's up, Mike? So, how are you, pal? -Well then, pal? -Who let you in? That's not how things work with me, you hear? Stop with the games, man, I know you want me here. Grey Shark and Charly together, we'd be great, no? Furthermore, check out this USB I've brought you, pal. Put it in. Come on, put it in. Turn it up. Like a bright star In front of your eyes If there's forgiveness It's yours to have If I hurt you, I didn't mean it… All right. Let's stop with the games. -I want you to sign with us. -Great, pal! Let's see that contract right now. Definitely. -Here's the pen. -Thanks, princess. Yeah, but we're going to save the song for a later date. What do you mean? No, wait. Put it on. No, yeah, sure. Believe me, I'll listen to it. But you know what? It's the lyrics. They're too bland. We need to spice it up, be more controversial. Lyrics that have, for example… partying, sex… Something hot. Hey, listen carefully. Like this one, listen. Hey, baby Come here if you want to be a star Move your booty This is gonna blow up Hey, baby Come here if you want to be a star Move your booty This is gonna blow up Leave your worries behind… What do you think? No, it's cool. But you know what, Mike? I was thinking of releasing something that's more my style, no? From my own hand. So everyone can forget about the stuff with Yeimy, those songs and everything, no? That's better, right? But you know something? What I want is something that gets the girls worked up and something that guys aspire to be, okay? -Will you get me a drink? -Of course. Whisky? -Yeah, sure. -Okay. Listen to me, Charly. You're gonna be the mega star that you couldn't be because of Yeimy Montoya. And everything she said to hurt you, we'll turn it on its head. All those interviews where she pretends to be the victim… I don't believe her. You know what? She tricked you, Charly. She fell in love with you and put you in prison. She was obsessed, buddy, don't you see? Man, this could be turned into a movie. But one that makes you look good. A movie that tells your side of the story. -A movie? Screw off. Seriously? -Of course. We can make music, movies, a series, it's all the rage right now. Videos, I could make a documentary on you. -A documentary? -Yeah.
