(wind howling) (hooves stomping) (tense music) (moves to exalted music) (moves to gentle music) (moves to exalted music) (moves to gentle music) (moves to exalted music) (moves to gentle music) (moves to exalted music) - [Announcer] Welcome to the Metropolitan Fall Barrel Race Jackpot. We have contestants from all over state here to compete today. A lot of good talent. And good morning from Tess's car wash, here this afternoon. (people chattering) These junior and senior division finalists have spend a lot of time preparing for this. Contestants will have final instructions, here in front of the announcement booth, in 15 minutes. - Hiya, Paula? - Good day, Mr. McDonald. - How you doin'? - We're fine. Is Paige all ready? - Well, I guess she is. She hasn't slept in a week getting ready for this. - She's really improved a lot this year. What horse did she draw? - Okay, let's see... Whirlwind. What? - Oh nothing really, it's just he's kinda skittish today. - Yeah? (sighs) I wish we could afford to board a horse for her own. - [Announcer] Barrel Race Fall Official is the final regional event for this competitor. The top five times turned in today will tell whose going to the western finals in two weeks. Remember, these times are decided (indistinct) - You ready to go? Yeah? What's wrong? Honey, you feel a little bit warm. - I'm just nervous. Don't worry, I'm fine. - Paige, I don't want you racing today if you're sick. There'll be plenty of other competition. - No, I'm okay, these are the finals, I have to race today. Please, daddy. (concerned music) - You sure? - I'm sure. - Okay. - How much do you think he would cost? - More than the Federal Reserve. - Come on. How much? - Honey, come on, we've been over this a million times, we can not afford to buy a horse. Or board one. Not now anyhow. - Someday I'm gonna have my very own horse. - All right. Someday. Go get 'em. (Paige chuckles) (buzzer buzzes) (crowd cheering) - [Announcer] Out of the gate, clean. (crowd cheering) - Her time, 18.7 seconds. (crowd cheering) Cathy-Ann, contestant number 10, taking the barrels real close. (crowd cheering) Ooh, that's gonna cost her. It's five points when a barrel is knocked over, and add that to her time. (bright music) (horse neighs) Next up, number seven, on Whirlwind, Paige McDonald. The time to beat here this afternoon is 18 seconds flat. (crowd cheering) (buzzer buzzes) Okay, here she goes. Still galloping hard to fend. (crowd cheering) First barrel, she's around clean. (crowd cheering) Into the second turn and into the final barrel. (crowd cheering) That colt kicks into high gear. Let's help the audience cheer. (crowd cheering) (Paige thumps) (suspenseful music) (concerned music) (distant intercom announcement) - CAT scan indicates a hematoma, that's bleeding in the brain, which we've controlled and drained. Spinal cord is affected, and there's a possibility of paralysis in lower extremities. - How much possibility? - It's hard to say, great deal depends on her. - Do you mean a wheelchair? - Probably, at least in the beginning. I won't lie to you, the chances are remote, at best, that she won't be at least partially impaired for the rest of her life. - And? - You have a lot of adjusting to do. The main problem you face will be helping her accept this. (longing music) (answering machine beeps) - [Paige] Daddy, I'm on my way home. Please be there, I don't wanna be late. I've got all my stuff, so I'll change there. Love you. (answering machine beeps) Daddy, I'm on my way home. Please be there, I don't wanna be late. I've got all my stuff, so I'll change there. Love you. (cassette rewinding scratch) Love you. (cassette rewinding scratch) Love you. (cassette rewinding scratch) Love you. (cassette rewinding scratch) Love you. (longing music continues) (longing music continues) - There we go. What do you think? (longing music continues) (Jim sighs) You look pretty. (longing music continues) (gentle music) (wind chime chiming) (longing music) - [Announcer on TV] Zoo Medicine is not a new concept, but it is a unique one. It's based on intensive one-on-one work with the patient, and a therapy called Zoo Medicine. The idea is for the patient to take care of animals, and speed up the recovery process. Focusing on the animals needs, rather than their own disabilities. Susan Allen is one of the top therapists in the country. - Fortunately there's no physical reason for the lack of speech now, I suspect the psychological trauma has a great deal to do with that. This is Susan Allen. After your call, I ask her to join us. She's examined Paige. - How do you do? After examining your daughter I must concur with Dr. Sloan's analysis of her condition. The psychological damage stems from a number of things. The injuries, stress, even fear. It's equally as severe as the physical impairments, perhaps even more so. - What do I do? - A change. A place where there are animals is required. - Well, a friend of my father's, Truman Richards, he owns a horse ranch. I'm sure he would help out if I asked him. - I only work with one child at a time. To be successful it has to be intensive, and it has to be done under certain conditions. - What conditions? - We can discuss that later. I'll be in touch. - She's an exceptional therapist. Now that you've hired her, why not give her a chance? - Yeah. There's a lotta warmth there. (tranquil music) (birds chirping) (horses neighing) (horses neighing) (hooves stomping) (horse neighs) - (sighs) She still ain't for sale, Miss Annaud. No discussion. - She's such a magnificent animal. - Hm-hm. - There is such a great profit for you, Mr. Richards. This will make you a wealthy man, a very wealthy man. (horse neighs) Such a horse, no? My client will pay whatever you ask. - Not interested, I don't need the money. I can show you a nice, happy colt, right over here. - I am sorry you won't reconsider. Good day, Mr. Richards. - She's something, ain't she? - Hm-hm. For a minute there I though you were gonna sell her Wind Dancer. - Why? - Because a white man would be dumb enough to sell his best horse to a woman just 'cause she smiled at him. - I'm gonna get all over you. (chuckles) (horse neighs) (bright music) (birds chirping) (car engine roars) (bright music continues) (bright music continues) - Well, you're peaked as a mean calf. You look like you was rode hard and put away wed, how are ya otherwise? - I'm doin' good, Truman, it's good to see ya. - Everything's ready for you. You got her in the car? - Yeah. Listen, I know we spoke about this, but you sure it's okay? - I can pay rent, you know? - Oh, will you quit that, I'm not taking rent from somebody I know since he was a kid. Your daddy and me was partners before you was even a twinkle in his eye. - I know- - Shut up. See, the deal is, you watch the place and we're even, all right? Now let's see that little girl of mine. Raymond, will you get your shanks in gear and feed them animals, quit fooling with them horses. Lord, he's a mess. Ol' Raymond's my hired man, he's suppose to be a hand, but he is a tad different. Well, just keep your eye on him, he's all right as long as you stay on top of him. But like I said, he ain't too swift. Lights on, nobody home. You still writing them how-to books? - Yeah, engineering manuals. I pick up the computer and use the phone to send them back to the company. Listen, Truman, this therapist who's coming by today, remember I spoke to you about it on the phone? It's part of the program, you know, working with animals. It's called Zoo Medicine. - Zoo? What's he, a vet? - No. No, nothing like that. He's a she. She's gonna spend quite a bit of time with Paige. - I've plenty of room. - We appreciate it. (soft music) Okay, sweetie, here we go. (Jim strains) - There ya are, little girl. Buggy's all ready for the grand tour. (dog barks) - Oh, this is B.W., you're gonna like him. B.W., huh? - Well, actually his full name, B.W.D., that's black and white dog. - Thought it was. What else would you call her, huh? Lead the way. (horses neigh) (gentle music) (horse neighs) - Ain't she a beauty? Look at the bone structure on her. That little mare is worth more than any 10 horses in this county. When she starts throwing colts, she gonna make a pretty penny. (horse neighs frantically) (tense music) - Whoa, don't be scared, honey, (chuckles) she won't hurt ya. - Honey, what happened? - Thought she liked horses. - Well, she loves horses, she just got scared. Paige! Truman, this is the first time she's moved, even her arms, since the accident. (horse neighs) - Wind Dancer gets a little spooked, that's strange. She's gentle. - Honey? What? (soft music) (falcon call) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (horses neigh) But then she started moving her arms. Then I though she was gonna say something. - It's possible, I'll know more in a few days. - But, you think that you can help her? - Your daughter has a very long way to go, Mr. McDonald. It's going to take a great deal of hard work and discipline. I believe that Paige' skills are better than she's demonstrating at this point. I'm willing to see this through under certain conditions. First, I alone am responsible for Paige' activities. I won't tolerate interference. Second, there will be no giving in to her when it starts to get rough. Understood? - I understand. - And finally, you need to realize that you're feeling guilty about the accident, that's understandable, but counterproductive. - Well, I can join the French Foreign Legion. - That won't be necessary, your cooperation will be. We'll start right away. (feet pattering) (Jim sighs) What is she eating? - It's a pretty bland diet. It's baby food, actually. - She should be eating solid foods by now. - She's not handling her fork too well yet. - Nonsense. (soft music) I believe you should feed yourself, Paige, or go hungry. Here, try. - I really think that it's too soon. - I'll handle this, please. Paige, you either eat or go hungry, it makes no difference to me. (soft music continues) - I don't think she's too keen on eating that at all. (tense music) - You will please eat. - I don't want to eat. - Just as I thought, you can speak. You just haven't wanted to, have you? Well, fine. From now on when you want something you tell me about it. Hating me won't help you, doing things for yourself will. You go to your room now. (concerned music) Let her do it. - Now wait a minute. - She must do it herself, let her. (concerned music continues) (anxious music) (Paige strains) (anxious music continues) (Paige strains) - All right, that is it. I am not gonna watch her collapse on the floor just to prove your point. (soft music) Hire the Wicked Witch of The West. Who does she think she is? - The boss, I expect. - It's not what I expected. Ma Barker with a diploma. - Well, she's a bit argumentative on grandchildren, kinda like my first wife. Well, I'll tell ya, she's done more with Paige in an hour than anybody else has around here for two months, and you're included. - Yeah, torture's great motivation, Truman. - You don't wanna be too quick to judge, she might just surprise you yet. - I don't know about that. Truman... Let me ask you something. What would you do? - Well, I learned a couple of things in this life, you don't run a foot race with a fellow named Flash, and don't bring a girl named Bubbles home to meet your mother. - What does that mean? - It means don't make an obvious mistake. I think you made a good choice so far. And that little girl of yours has got a long, hard road ahead of her. I tell you, it'd be easier trying to dance with the wind than do what she's got to do. Give 'em a chance, you gotta write them how-to books of yours. Let 'em have some time together. I'll come by now and then to check on the horses. (door slams) - You think I was too tough? Your daughter is physically impaired from the accident, but she's also experiencing a great emotional trauma. Her self-worth is in question now, it's my job to help her. I can't do that if I give into her. - She is 12 years old. - Yes, and I intend that she will function on her own by the time she's 13. I know what I'm doing. You have to learn to trust me and my methods. - We'll give it some time, then we'll see. - I don't start jobs I can't finish. I'm sorry, but you'll have to decide now. If you're not willing to see it through, I'll leave in the morning. - Boy, you really don't give much, do you? - I can't, nothing would get accomplished. (concerned music) (horses neigh) - I can't do it, - Yes, you can, try again. - No, I can't. - Try it again. (Paige strains) (gentle music) (gentle music continues) (keyboard buttons clicking) (Jim sighs) (horse neighs) (tense music) (gentle music) (gentle music continues) (cow moo's) (wind chime chiming) (gentle music continues) (chickens clucking) You'll like it more. I guarantee you will. Our friend, pig. Okay, we all need to be set, did you forget? It's your job, okay? If you don't feed 'em, they don't eat. (pig snorting) And Wilbur likes to eat. Okay, go on, try it. Come on, you need to learn to do chores for yourself. Try it. (dog whining) (Raymond thumps) (Raymond groans) (milk squirting) (cow moo's) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (hammer knocking) (horses neighing) (hammer knocking) (Jim stomps foot) (gentle music continues) (horse neighs) - You trying by me, Miss Jughead. Your day will come, you'll see Miss High and Mighty. (pitchfork clanging) (horse neighs) (knife scraping) (fork clangs) (gentle music) (horses neigh) (gentle music) (dog whining) Oh yeah. (dog growls) What are you looking at? - More? (spoon clangs) Pick it up. I've put together a schedule for you. There's a lot to get done. I know you can do it, I think you know it too. But there's a difference between knowing and believing. When you're facing a difficult task you have to believe it's impossible to fail. When you go after Moby Dick, you take along tartar sauce. You're going to take on new responsibility. You only have to take care of Wind Dancer from now on. (Paige strains) And you alone will be responsible for Wind Dancer's needs. You understand? This corral is a lot further than you're used to, but it'll make you strong. Mobility. Do you know what that means? - It means, getting around. - Good. That's right. Getting you around is gonna take practice and a lot more strength in those arms. So you know what we're going to do? - Push-ups? - Close. You're gonna push yourself to this corral twice everyday. And you alone are gonna take care of all of Wind Dancer's needs. Okay? (Paige sighs) It's the last time I'm gonna help you. From now on, you do it yourself, alone. So, what do you think? Hm, three months ago you could barely feed yourself. - I can't do it. (horse neighs) - Paige, you're too smart for me to lie to you, so I won't. This corral's like your life. If you don't do something about it now, you're gonna be penned in that chair forever. Is that what you want? Do you? - No. - Can't hear you. - I said, no. - Then we're gonna get you some mobility. Because mobility is freedom. You understand that? That's a better attitude, much better. Don't you say thank you when someone gives you a compliment? Oh, really? It's the only way you're gonna get rid of me. Come on. Good boy. (horse neighs) - Thank you. - Your turn. (gentle music) - I'll have that old Indian buckskin for you in a couple of days. When the time is right, I'll get you Wind Dancer. And you better fill in four states. - And we'll know that Mr. Richards will not sell her, yes? - I'll take car of that. But this French count, you sure he has enough money to pay? - Oh, he will pay, he wants to start a new breeding line. But you, you are taking a chance, no? - Just don't say nothing, to nobody. I'll have that horse faster than you can spit sideways. (smirks) It's a done deal. (chuckles) - Come on, we got more work to do. (pitchfork clangs) (horse neighs) - Settle down! Ya hammerhead! It ain't your turn yet. (horse neighs) - See, a new friend. - The name's George. Named after some old time band. Any one of them is better than Wind Dancer, that's for sure. - What do you mean? - She's loco. - Loco? - Crazy. Right from the time she was a colt, ain't never been right. Right here, real flaky. I don't know why Mr. Richards is just so God darn stubborn about selling her, she'll never breed. She's too loco. - Loco isn't exactly a clinical term. She's just afraid. Sound familiar? (horse neighs) Come on, work to do. (Raymond chuckles) (gentle music) (suspenseful music) - Come on, old friend, I'm gonna get you a new home. (chuckles) Make ol' Raymond rich. (suspenseful music continues) - You sure you shut the gate? He coulda just nosed out during the night. - No, he was led out. See those boot prints next to the horse tracks? - (sighs) We got us a rustler then. - Yeah, probably a white man. - Why do you say that? - Well, an Indian would have rode him out, it's easier, and he wouldn't leave the boot prints. And he took the oldest horse in the corral... Only a white man would be that stupid. (Truman grunt) - Hi. - Hey. - How's it going? - Fine. Making progress. But Paige can tell you for herself. - How you doin', honey? - Okay, daddy. - Good. - Go on in, you still have homework to do. What do you think? - I hate to admit it, but I'm impressed. - She's a remarkable young lady. - You know, there was a time that I thought I'd never hear her say that again. - What? - Daddy. I took it for granted. (horse neighs) (spanner clanging) (Raymond's hand knocks) (Raymond groans) (phone rings) - Eagle Mountain Ranch. No, I'm sorry, he's not here right now, can I help ya? Jim McDonald. - I can't do it. - If you want it badly enough you can do it. - I don't want it that bad. - You're almost halfway there, go on. Go on! (horse neighs) (gentle music) - It's kind of a long way by herself, isn't it? - Yes, and so is regaining the use of her legs. Keep going! (gentle music continues) - I'll be in the house getting dinner ready, if you need me. Making crow. (crow caws) (water burbling) - I hope you choke on it. (horse neighs) - "When the girls saw that performance, Jo began to dance a jig, by way of expressing her satisfaction. Amy nearly fell out of the window in her surprise, and Meg exclaimed, with uplifted hands, 'Well, I do believe the world is coming to an end.'" - I think you've lost your audience. - I think you're right. (fire crackling) Would you mind if I ask you something personal? - You can ask. - And don't get me wrong, you work miracles with Paige- - But. - No! No, no but. Just that I... Well, I sorta wondered why you don't have a family of your own? It must be hard to spend a couple of months with one family and then move on. Do you have a man somewhere? - There are men everywhere. I guess I just haven't had time to find the right one, with my work and all. Family... Sometimes I think of my patients as family. - How do you figure? - When I meet them... They're usually impaired to the point where they're like small children... Even infants. I help them grow. Like Paige. I keep in touch. - Must be kinda lonely? - No. My business requires a certain professional detachment, otherwise you can become too absorbed. Lose your objectivity. I avoid that. I think I'll go to bed now. Good night. - Good night. Susan. Sometimes people can avoid too much. (fire crackling) (gentle music) Will anything ever be like it was before? You have to keep trying. Susan can help you. I was wrong about her. I was wrong about a lot of things. If I could, I would give you my legs. But I can't do that. That's why you have to keep trying. (Jim sniffs) I love you so much. (lips smacking) (gentle music continues) Sleep good. (Susan sighs) - Quit being so pushy. I'm feeding you, aren't I? I hate you. (pitchfork clangs) (soft music) (soft music continues) (thunder rumbling) (birds chirping) (rain pattering) (thunder rumbling) (soft music continues) - Hurry, Paige, feed Wind Dancer and come back for dinner, it's almost ready. (thunder rumbling) (soft music continues) (horse snorts) (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) All done? - Yes. - Chores, I mean. - I said, yes. Everything. (rain pattering) (thunder cracking) (rain pattering) (thunder rumbling) (horse neighs) - Paige. Paige, wake up. Hey. - what? - You have something to do. - What? Wind Dancer, you didn't feed him this afternoon, did you? - It was raining, he can wait till tomorrow. - No, he can't. He's your responsibility, now get dressed. - Now? - Right now. - But- - No buts, get moving, you're going to feed him. (thunder rumbling) - What's going on? - Daddy, I don't want to, please don't make me. - Settle down. - Tell him page. - Daddy, I'm sorry, I didn't feed Wind Dancer this afternoon, but it was raining and I couldn't get through all that mud. - You're making her go out in a storm, at this hour, to feed that horse? - She made a commitment and she's going to keep it. - She'll catch pneumonia. I'll do it. - No, she'll do it. (thunder rumbling) - Can I speak with you a moment? Alone. - Sure. (rain pattering) (thunder rumbling) - Now look... I will be the first to admit that I was wrong about your treatment of Paige. I have seen the wonders that you have done with her, but this, this is not important to her development, this is just punishment. - This is not just punishment, this is so much more than that, this is the key to your daughter's entire life. If you think that all I'm doing is trying to punish Paige, then you don't understand the therapy. This is not about punishment, this is about commitment. Zoo Therapy works, because the patient begins to care more for the animal than for themselves. Sacrifice is the underlying principle, she needs to learn that, just like in life. (concerned music) - I just don't see what sending her out into the storm is. - Believe me, this is absolutely vital for her. She needs to do this herself, no help from us. Or she'll never do another thing for herself. (thunder rumbling) (tense music) (concerned music) (rain pattering) - It's all your fault. You wanted to eat so bad, eat! (sobs) fine. And I don't care if you never eat. (thunder rumbling) I hate place, I hate them. (tense music) I hate you. You hear me, I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. (dramatic music) I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. (dramatic music continues) (gentle music) (rooster crowing) ♪ I was caught in a dream ♪ Where the darkness formed around me ♪ ♪ And my life isn't what it seems ♪ ♪ It held me down and so afraid ♪ ♪ You woke me up and turn the page ♪ ♪ Let in some light, light the stage of my life ♪ (horse neighs) ♪ And cleared my eyes for me ♪ Someday, someway, now I can see ♪ ♪ You didn't let me dream ♪ Sometime, somehow, I found myself free ♪ ♪ Through someone, someone who needed me ♪ ♪ Needing someone who needs me - Ready? ♪ Now I'm caught in a dream - Ta-da, what do you think? ♪ I once felt hopeless ♪ But with your strength ♪ I made it through ♪ That dream is real, 'cause I found you ♪ ♪ In my life ♪ You cleared my eyes for me ♪ Someday, someway, now I can see ♪ ♪ You didn't let things be ♪ Sometime, somehow, I found my self free ♪ - Get to sit there and feed that caius. I hate that horse. And now I gotta work. It just ain't right. (Raymond sighs) Raymond do this, Raymond do that, all day long. Raymond shovel this, Raymond shovel that. (gentle music) - [Susan] We need to do something with this hair of yours, you're much too pretty for this. Who's been doing your hair, The Three Stooges? - Daddy. He only knows ponytails. Mommy used to do it when I was little. When she. - How did she die? - And my little brother, he died too. You though it was cancer or something, didn't you? Everybody does. About time I should feed Wind Dancer, isn't it? - Yeah, I guess so. - Susan, I just wanna say I'm sorry, for the way I acted. For hurting me. I didn't mean it. I hate what's happened to me, I hate my wheelchair. Sometimes I hate everything about this. But I don't hate you. - I know that. But thanks for telling me though, it means a lot. (horse neighs) - Come on. (horse neighs) Get down! Come here! Come on, now! You stupid, arrogant! Come on, beast! You dumb animal! Come on! Come on, now! Come on! (tense music) (dog barks) (horse neighs) (whip slaps) (horse neighs) - Stop it! Stop it! Raymond, stop hitting him! - Come on! Get down! You come here. I'll show ya, ya dumb animal. Damn it! (grunts) - [Paige] Stop hitting him! Raymond, stop! - Jim! (suspenseful music) (horse neighs) (horse neighs) - Stay here. (Raymond grunts) (horse neighs) (horse neighs) (fist thuds) All right, that's it, you're fired. Get your things and get outta here. - You don't own this place. And I'm up to here taking orders from you. Raymond do this, Raymond do that. You don't run me. And you can't fire me. - I just did. I'll have your check in a few minutes. - You can't fire me! You hear that? You'll be sorry. - I love you, Dancer. I'll always take care of you. Always. (horse neighs) - Have you things? Here's your check. - Why are you giving me the bum's rush? I've worked here a long time. - You wanna know why? Because your work is shoddy. Every time I turn my back, you're sitting down on the job. Worse than that, you're not even there at all. Plus, there's a couple of things missing around here that no one can seems to account for. Now, is that enough? Or do I need to call the sheriff? - Nope, it's plenty. - Good, I thought it would be. - Plenty for now. - Did you say something, Raymond? - I've got a lot of things to say to you. (dog growls) I'll send you a postcard. (truck engine roars) (pig grunts) (water swishing) - Hey, guess what? We're going into the auction in town today. Don't worry, I'll be back in time to feed ya. I wouldn't forget you, you know that. (horse neighs) - [Susan] Come on, B.W.! - I'll drive. - Come on, in the back. Good boy. (feelgood music) (truck engine roars) (horse neighs) (feelgood music continues) - [Auctioneer] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the (indistinct) family (indistinct) auction. As you can see, we've got some of the best. (auctioneer announcements) We've got horses, we've got caves, we've got chickens. (auctioneer announcements) (gentle music) - Aah, I thought we'd never get here. - [Susan] Oh, wasn't that long. (auctioneer chants) (people chattering) - [Auctioneer] We've Got 105, Thank You Very Much. (auctioneer chanting) (people chattering) Next item is up, what have we got? We've got a fine (chanting). (horse neighs) (people chattering) - Thanks very much. You okay? (auctioneer chanting) - [Auctioneer] 75, good, 75, give me 100. 104, did you bid, did you go? I got 375, look at the (chants). - You understand all this? - I'm not born in it, I'm just kinda learning. Truman wanted me to get some quotes on some market prices before he got back. - I can't even understand the auctioneer, how do you? - Well, kinda like a song. You have to listen for the lyrics. - Some lyrics. - Daddy, I'm hungry. - Honey, I can't leave right now. Can you wait a couple of minute? - Why don't you let her go to the concession stand by herself, it's not that far. - Yeah? - Yeah. - You gonna be okay? - Hm-hm. - Don't be gone too long. - Okay. - Won't you take B.W. with? - Hm-hm. - Here. - Come on B.W. (dog barks) - [Auctioneer] Here's the next item coming up. (cow moo's) - [Boy] Hey, come on, let's take a shortcut. - You wanna take a shortcut? (soft music) Come on. (cow moos) (cow sniffs) (cow moos) (tense music) Hi. - Hi. - Can I have two hotdogs, please? - Sure, what do you want on 'em? - One with everything, one just plain. - Okay, let me get that ketchup and mustard. (dog whining) Whoa, now wait, I though I put two- - You did. He's kind of a sneak sometimes. - Oh you are, are you? Well, it's a good thing your friend here is so honest. - Thank you. (auctioneer chanting) (mysterious music) - [Auctioneer] We've got 500, thank you very much. We've got $500 (chants). (suspenseful music) (cow moos) (cow moos) (dog barks) (cow moos) (dog barks) (cow moos) (dog barks) (cow moos) (dog barks) (tense music) (cow moos) (dog barks) - Shush! (cow moo's) - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Paige, I don't understand what you were doing in the holding pen in the first place? - It was a shortcut. The bull wasn't in there when I went in. - It could have been a shortcut to the hospital. - Won't you wheel around and I'll help. You're right to be concerned, but this is a big breakthrough for Paige, don't you see it? Paige handled this all by herself. No one helped her. (Jim sighs) Well, your English composition needs a little work, but your math is 100%. - I'd rather eat "Moby Dick" than read it. - You can rewrite it first. - I gotta go out to that north pasture and fix the fence again. Wanna come? - Can't, Herman Melville won't let me. - Aah. - Why don't you take Susan? - No, I can't leave you alone. - I'm okay, I'll be all right. I know how to take care of myself. I had a good teacher. (Susan smirks) - She's right. Besides, Truman will be back later on. Wanna come? - Are you sure you'll be all right? - I'm sure. - See you later. - Bye. (gentle music) What do you think? (dog whines) Yeah, me too. (horse neighs) (gentle music continues) (cows mooing) (horse neighs) - You okay? - Yes. - You're riding good. - So do you. I grew up on a small ranch in the Northwest, my dad had some (indistinct). - Really? - Yes. - I don't know, for some reason I thought you're one of those city girls. - (chuckles) I always thought riders sat in small rooms, huddled over turkey roast. - Oh? Huddled over word processors. Dad and Truman used to ranch a lot when I was a kid. So I know a lot about it, but just never wanted to do it. So I took off for college and headed for the city. I've been wanting to thank you for helping Paige the way you have. I never woulda hoped she'd be as good as she is now. When here mom died a little piece of me died and I never really got close to anything or anyone. My whole world was pretty much wrapped up in her. But you changed that. And I wanna thank you. (muffled upbeat rock music) (dog whines) Need to put a dancer in here to keep the wire together. We got a lotta dancer around this place, don't we? Got a fence dancer, we got a Wind Dancer. I'm very sincere, though, about what I said. You've really done wonders with Paige. - I'm more of a catalyst, the wonders were already there inside her. But thank you, it's been a very gratifying case. - There you go again. - What do you mean? - I don't know... I just get the feeling that Paige is more than just a case to you. - Why? - Just a feeling. We sorta started off on the wrong foot, you and I. That's probably my fault more than it was yours. You were pretty upfront about your therapy, and I was just a overindulging father. Hand me those wire cutters will you? Thanks. I guess it was inevitable that we were gonna butt heads sooner or latter. But you gave her a new life. And I can never repay you for that. - That's my job, I just- - I know it's your job, I just want to let you know how I feel. I just like us to be friends, that's all. - I appreciate your honesty. I'm not the drill sergeant you think I am. - I know that. - I don't blame you, I come on pretty strong. Working with these children requires more than love, it requires a firm hand. Sometimes it's easier to be firm than to be loving. Keeps away the pain. - I don't know about that. You seem very loving to me. Maybe you just haven't found the right person to spend the time on. I don't mean children. (soft music) We've got a lotta fence to mend. - Yeah. - Come on. I want to show you something. (gentle music) (water gushing) (gentle music continues) (elated music) (muffled upbeat rock music) (footsteps taping) (dog whines) (tense music) (suspenseful music) (Raymond chuckles) (dog whines) (muffled upbeat rock music) (dog whines) - What? (dog barks) What is it? (dog barking) You wanna hear? (suspenseful music) (horse neighs) - Here horsy, aah, that's a good horsy. Thanks to that girl to tame you down somin'. You're going to France. Ol' Raymond's going to easy- (horse neighs) Calm down you crazy horse! (horse neighs) Calm down now! - There you go. (horse neighs) (suspenseful music) (dog barks) (horse neighs) - What are you doing you stupid hammerhead? You rotten horse! (suspenseful music continues) (dog barks) (horse neighs) (dog barks) I'm taking you dead or alive, it don't matter none to me. Why, it would be better if you were dead. (suspenseful music continues) (wheelchair rattling) Come on, you crazy horse! Calm down now! (dog growls) (horse neighs) You blasted horse! (dog growls) (Raymond yells) (horse snorts) (gasps) Where are you going you stupid horse? (anxious music) (horse neighs) (horse neighs) (Raymond and horse thumps) (tense music) (dog barks) (Raymond strains) (playful music) I hate that horse! (bright music) (dog barking) (cougar growls) (suspenseful music) (cougar growls) (anxious music) (truck engine roars) (anxious music continues) (cougar growls) (suspenseful music) - Let's try this one. (Paige breathing heavily) (cougar growls) What's that? (cougar growling) (dog whines) It's a cougar, isn't it? (cougar growls) (Paige sighs) (suspenseful music) - Couldn't have gone very far yet. - Ol' Raymond, let the sheriff worry about him. (dog whines) (Paige straining) - We've got wheelchair tracks. - Paige has gone after him by herself. (Paige breathing heavily) (horse neighs) (horse neighs) (dog barks) (suspenseful music) (horse neighs) (cougar growls) (horse neighs) (cougar growls) (horse snorts) (horse neighs) (cougar growls) (suspenseful music) (cougar growls) (horse snorts) (horse neighs) (suspenseful music continues) (horse neighs) (Paige yells) - Dancer! (cougar growls) (horse neighs) (dog barks) (cougar growls) (horse neighs) (suspenseful music continues) (cougar growls) (horse neighs) (cougar growls) No! (cougar growls) Stop! (cougar growls) (horse neighs) (cougar growls) (dog barks) (horse neighs) (cougar growls) (horse neighs) (dog barks) Stop! (cougar growls) (dog barks) (horse neighs) (cougar growls) (suspenseful music continues) (dog barks) (cougar growls) (horse neighs) (cougar growls) (suspenseful music) (cougar growls) (dog yelps) (cougar growls) (cougar growls) (horse neighs) (dog whines) (horse neighs) (horse neighs) (cougar growls) (horse neighs) (cougar growls) (horse snorts) (soft music) (cougar growls) (horse snorts) (elated music) We did it, we did it. You're all right now, you're okay. (horse snorts) - Not exactly. (chuckles) Finally got you, you knot-headed caius. Thanks for getting her, missy, you saved me some trouble. (Raymond strains) (horse neighs) Calm down you knucklehead. Oh yeah, put ol' Raymond on easy street, ain't ya? - Leave her alone. Take your hands off her. - You're all my, yes you are. (tense music) (horse neighs) (air whooshing) (horse neighs) (concerned music) (Raymond thumps) (horses neigh) (gentle music) - How you doin', little sister? (Truman strains) Better get you off the ground. - B.W.'s hurt. (dog whines) He's hurt real bad. There was a cougar, and. (sighs) - You're all right. You're okay, yes. He's clawed pretty good. The mother cougar's got a den up there. She was just protecting her young. I don't think she'll be back. - Ol' Raymond here has been stealing horses all over the county. Get up you knock out! - Huh? Aah. Well, we can come back and get your wheelchair, but how are we gonna get you outta here? - Easy. - Thank goodness, are you all right? - Yeah, B.W.'s hurt... Bad. - All right, a little worse for wear, but just fine. - Paige, how are you riding that horse? - Spitting vinegar, that's how. (dog barks) (Raymond and Susan laugh) (bright music) (horse neighs) I still like Ol' McDonald's Farm, it's got a better ring to it. - Really? - Hm-hm. - Maybe you'd like some of those golden arches over the house too, is that right? - So you gonna bring up some other kids like Paige, and try and get them better? - Well, Susan seems to think we can help enough kids to make a go of it. Hey, what happened to Raymond? - The sheriff says Raymond is gonna be learning a new trade for a while. Him and that slick looking French lady, she was the one buying up all the stolen livestock. So they're gonna be staying down at the crowbar hotel for a few years, making license plates. - Crowbar hotel, huh? - Howdy, Susan? Well, look at you, what have we got there? - Got it in a Cracker Jack box. - Thank you. - Yes. (chuckles) - I make her hold it underwater so it looks a little bigger. - How's the little girl doing? - She's making progress. She's getting stronger. Hopefully we'll get her on some crutches instead of that chair soon. - Well, walkin' on her own, new place, new mom, things are lookin' up. Where is she, anyway? - She's over there. (soft music) (horse snorts) - Ready to go? (horse neighs) - I never though I'd see anybody ride that filly. Least of all, Paige. It's like dancing with the wind.
