(Multicom Jingle) (dramatic music) (train horn blowing) (upbeat music) (train horn blowing) (soft chatter) (upbeat music) - [Rainie] Billy, wake up. (upbeat band music) (excited chatter) ("The Army Goes Rolling Along") - We're home? - We're home. (train horn blowing) (people applauding and cheering) (people cheering) (upbeat music) - [Sara] Billy! - Sara! - [Sara] Billy! - Sara! Oh, oh my God! Look at you. - [Sara] Oh Billy. - Oh God. - I missed you so much. - Look at you, I leave you alone for four years and look what happens to you, you've grown up on me. Rainie when I saw her last she was a skinny, freckle-faced girl, now look at her, golly. She's a knockout, isn't she a knockout? - [Rainie] Knocked me out. - Wait, where's grandpa? - Grandpa's not doing so good Billy. - I wanna go see him. - Let's go. - [Billy] Well how'd you get here? - I drove. - You're driving now! - Yeah, so next week I get to take the training wheels off my bicycle. - God, okay. - Say you mind if I catch a ride to the bus station with y'all? - It's okay with me if you don't mind riding with a baby sister. - Be my baby any day. - You're Rainie Pritchard aren't ya? - [Rainie] The one and only. - That's Stumpy? - That's Stumpy. - [Rainie] That's what they used to call me. - Boy this place has sure built up since the last time I was here. So you're a college girl now, huh? - If I don't get through this trig course I won't be for long. - What college are you going to? - Centenary. - Isn't that expensive? - I'm on a scholarship. - For what? - Choir. - Watch where you're going. - I see him. - Choir, they give scholarships for that? (chuckling) So, how come you haven't asked me about my leg yet? - What happened? - Iwo Jima. Caught a slug right below the knee. I woulda bled to death if old Rainie here hadn't pulled me to safety. - They couldn't save it? - They didn't even have time to try. Not with all the casualties they were tending to. You know what that's called? What? Rainie you know exactly what I'm talking about. It's called triage. - What's triage? - Well let's say you got a boy in a stretcher with a chest wound and in the next stretcher you got someone else with a severe head wound, well the doctors are gonna treat the chest wound, because the poor sap that got shot in the head, well he's a gonner anyhow. And if you've got a mangled leg, well it's a heck of a lot easier to take a hacksaw to it than it is to piece it together again, that's triage. And that's what happened to my leg little sister. And that is what the war is all about. (dramatic music) - I'm sorry Billy. - We're home Billy, we made it. So what's for supper Sara? (snoring) - [Billy] Grandpa. Grandpa. - Who's that? - Hey, it's me, Billy. - [Will] Billy? - Yeah. - Billy! Oh my goodness my boy, good to see you! How are ya, you made it home did ya? Let me look at ya. - [Billy] I did, I made it back. - My golly, look at them medals and stripes, and everything, how in the world are you? - [Billy] I'm good, how are you? - Well I'm fine as frog's hair. - Oh, that's not what I hear. - Who's this fella here? - Rainie Pritchard, sir. - You remember Rainie, from back home? We were in the same outfit together. - He's the one that saved Billy's life. - Why I sure do, welcome here my boy, good to see ya. - [Sara] Grandpa now, let's not get yourself too worked up, boys let's let grandpa. - Now wait a minute, they just got here. - You'll see plenty of them after supper, now I'll bring yours in directly. - You will not, I'm getting up, I'm having supper at the table. (upbeat music) - Come on. (laughing) - Rainie let me get you another piece of pie. - No, no, no I can't, I'm full. - Oh, come on you've only had two. - Billy, will you do something about your little sister, she's killing me. - I can't help you there buddy, she's got a mind of her own. - I'll have a piece of that pie. - Grandpa, you know you can't have any pie. - You can't control the girl. - Well I don't think she's all that tough. - Well you just might be surprised. - You never can tell. Say, anybody know what time it is? - I do! Quarter to 9:00. - The last bus leaves at 9:30, I better be going. - Oh I can get you there, but we'd have to leave right now. - [Rainie] You don't mind? - No, no, not at all. - [Rainie] Sorry I gotta eat and run partner. - Well you want me to go with ya? - [Sara] Oh, no thanks Billy. - No, no, that's okay, I'll be happy to. - No thanks, Billy. - Nice seeing you Mr. Coleman. - Good to meet you sir. - Take care. - I'll be back soon. - [Will] You drive carefully you hear? - [Sara] Okay. - Well, what's the matter with you? (scoffing) - You're just gonna let her go like that? - Why not? - Grandpa, Rainie's my best friend, but that doesn't mean I like that fact that he's with Sara, alone. I've seen this guy in action, and I don't mean the battlefield. - I don't think you're giving your little sister enough credit, she's a grown woman you know. - I know, and that's what worries me. - Don't worry, she can take care of herself. Now I'm going out on the porch, why don't you bring your coffee and come with me? - Gosh, it sure feels good to drive a car after all this time. It's funny the things you miss when you're away. - I read your letter and I'm sorry about your leg. You know, they tell me that the coon hunting around here is number one. - Is that so? (chuckling) Well, I haven't been coon hunting in a long time grandpa, not since I was a kid. (soft music) - Maybe it's about time you tried it again? - No, I don't think so, not with this leg. - Billy, you remember when you was a young fella and you had a tough time saving up the money for that dog, what was it Red Boy? - Old Dan and Little Ann. - You remember how we talked about you making a deal with God, and how if he held up his end of the bargain you'd meet him halfway? Did you do that, did you meet him halfway? How do you know? - 'Cause I got my dogs. - No different now you know? Just gotta meet him halfway. Would you be at all interested in looking and seeing what's out in the barn? (chuckling) - You better not have. - Welcome home my boy, this old man's going to bed. - Grandpa, come on. - What? - I'm not gonna go stumbling around in the dark just to check out the barn. - There's a lantern hanging right on the corner of the house. - [Billy] What about the yard is it level? - No sir, it's bumpy, it's bumpy all the way. There's nothing guaranteed you know? - You're messing with me old man. (upbeat music) - Well Sara, thank you for the ride. And you take care of that no good brother of yours. - When will we see you again? Billy would wanna know. - Well that depends. - Depends on what? - If we're gonna go out Saturday night. - Saturday, Saturday let me see. - I'll pick you up at 8:00. - Old man. Oh boy I'm gonna drown you if you're messing with me tonight. (soft music) (puppies whimpering) (chuckling) I don't need this! (upbeat music) (scoffing) (chuckling) Look at this. Huh, look at this, yeah you like that don't you? Great. You ready to go out, huh? You ready to go out with me? Come here. I don't have time for this. Come here you, come on. (sighing) Come on get back in. You're gonna drive me nuts, no stay. Get in there, get back down, you're gonna drive me crazy. Get in, come on. There you go, get your tail off. Get in there. (chuckling) I don't have time for this! Come on. (chuckling) - Well he knew the trouble we went to to get the dogs for you, not to mention the money. Think of all the clothes I could've bought. - Sara, I'm sorry okay, but you should've asked me first. I mean I don't want the dogs, I don't need the responsibility. Look, it was a very sweet thing that you and grandpa did but I just I can't have it, it's not gonna work. - It wasn't something me and grandpa did, it was all his idea, and all his money. - Well fine then, fine I'll pay him back. - You're gonna break his heart. Billy, just keep the dogs! - Sara I can't, I don't know how long I'm gonna be here. I'm planning on sending out job applications, that might take me away from here. Sara, I just, I have to get on with my life. I can't keep doing this. - Then just keep the dogs while grandpa's still with us? - How long's that gonna be? Sara, he doesn't look that critical to me. - Well I know he doesn't look it, but the doctors have given him two months, three months at the longest to live, who knows, you may get lucky, he may die before you get a job. - That's nice, that's really nice. - Okay, I'm sorry. Just look at the dogs. - I looked at the dogs all last night. - Good morning sweet pea, isn't she the sweetest thing? Hello. (soft music) Just long enough for grandpa to see. What are you gonna name 'em? - Well the other dogs were named Ann and Dan, and they looked a lot like these two. - Well then, why don't you just call them Ann and Dan? - I guess I could couldn't I? What do you say about that Little Ann? Huh, you like that name? - I think she likes it. - What do you think about Old Dan, huh? What do you think about Old Dan? I think he wants to get back to bed, don't you? Thank you for keeping him. - Hey, let's go into grandpa's room, let's wake grandpa up. - Ah! - Okay? - Okay, all right. - What's going on here? What's going on here? What's going on here? Oh my goodness, that's a heck of a way to wake an old man up out of a sound sleep. - I think they like him. - Oh grandpa, you done it again. All right guys, get the coon scent, come on. Get the coon scent, there you go. Okay Sara, I want you to rub this good in the ground first, then drag it along, and bring it around the corner of the house. - Okay, like this? - Right, even more. Okay, and then go around and hide it behind that pecan tree. Let's just see if these mutts have a nose on 'em old man. Okay guys, here's the deal, if you want me to train you to be coon hunters you better do your end of the bargain, you understand? And I promise to do my part. But, if you don't turn out to be as good as I used to have, if you just wanna be a bunch of lazy, flea bitten, front porch biscuit eaters, well, that's fine by me. I won't have nothing to do with you then, you understand? - Homer! (honking horn) - Who's that? - That's Homer Jeffries and his boy Wilson, they live up the road. - Sara, you ready? Okay, here goes nothing. Go get it, go on. Well if you clear a space for them there on the porch I'll just tell Sara to go cook those biscuits. - Come here, come here. Come here, come here. (upbeat music) Slow down, come here. (dogs growling) Good boy. Good, yeah. Good boy. - Old Dan, Little Ann, come on, come on. Dan, puppy, puppy, puppy, puppy, puppy, come here. Little Ann, Little Ann come on, come on let's go. Little Ann, come here girl, come here girl. Good girl, good girl. Good boy, you want another one? You have to listen to me. Come here, Little Ann, Little Ann come on. Don't eat the flowers, come on. Come on dude. Come on Little Ann, Little Dan come on, come on, come on. There you go. (upbeat music) (happy chatting) Come on, come on. (both talking) Go get it, go get it Dan. You're gonna have to fight for it. Fight for it, come on get in there. You tired, you had enough? Good boy, they're pretty good. - [Sara] Good girl. - Old Dan. - Did he wear you out? - Way to go. - Let's go to sleep, let's get a good night's sleep, okay? All right get down and go to sleep. - [Billy] You gonna be nice to your sister, huh? - [Sara] Come on. - [Billy] No fighting. - Now you go to sleep. Get a good night's rest, give me a kiss. Goodnight. - [Billy] Watch out. - Let your legs go to sleep, night-night, go on to sleep Old Dan. (soft music) - [Billy] Tell me about choir. I didn't know you had a good voice. - I have a great voice. - [Billy] Do ya? What's your favorite song, what do you like to sing? - [Sara] Amazing Grace. - [Billy] Oh, everybody sings Amazing Grace. You gotta stand out, you gotta be like. - [Sara] I'm studying very carefully. - [Billy] If you want to stand out at Centenary you gotta sing something else like Stars and Stripes. (upbeat music) - Here, you tore my book for heck's sake. Don't you have no wrecks on my bed here. - Go, go team go! (dogs barking) Get up Dan, come on buddy, come on, come on, come on, come on, come up, that's right, there you go, there you go! Come on, come on Ann. (soft music) (people chatting) - All right, I can get this, I've got it. (chuckling) - I'm sorry. - You know those people act like they ain't never seen no one in a wheelchair. - Or, with a gimp leg. - Yeah, or with a gimp leg. - And we were going up Mount Suribachi. - Say, did you help raise the flag? - No, no, I didn't get quite that far. Anyhow, all of a sudden, I mean from all around, every direction. - Both flanks. - Both flanks. My buddies were falling left and right, and I caught one right below the knee. And you know what the funny thing about it was? It wasn't even that serious, it missed the bone. - Triage. - Yep. - What'd you do that for? What if somebody saw you. - Well, what if they did little sister? (upbeat band music) - Rainie. - Now, don't Rainie me little sister. You know from the first moment I saw you at the train station I knew we were gonna be together, and you did too. And don't try and deny it. Well you're not gonna try and deny it now are you? - Stop it, Rainie. Rainie stop it or I'll scream, I will. - Well now that won't be necessary, if you want me to leave you alone I'd be more than happy to. - I don't want you to leave me alone, but. - But what little sister? - I wish you'd stop calling me that. I don't want you to leave, but I'm not that kinda girl. - There's something you've got to understand, I'm not one of your little fraternity boyfriends. I've been to war, and I've seen killing, a whole lot of killing, and if there's one thing that I learned you know what that is? That life is short, very short, it can be over just like that. No warning, no tomorrow. So if there's something you want out of life you've got to take it, 'cause it might not be there tomorrow. And darling there's something I want, right here and right now. - [Sara] Rainie no, Rainie. - Go on, run back to big brother, go on. God! - She doesn't have to Rainie, I'm here. - Look Billy, your sister and I. Billy. Look, Billy I am not gonna fight you. - Too proud to fight a one-legged man, is that it? - That has nothing to do with it, we're buddies Billy. - Yeah, you shoulda thought of that before you messed with my sister. - But you don't understand! - I don't understand, I don't understand! - Look, are you sure you didn't catch some shrapnel in the back of the head? 'Cause you're acting like a crazy man. - [Billy] Oh yeah, I'll show you crazy if I get my hands on you. - Go home Billy. - [Billy] Come here. - Go home. (dramatic music) - How long you been standing there? - Just a little bit. I'm very, very sorry if I frightened you last night Sara. I really am. Well. - Well, what? - I said I was sorry. - I got that, see ya later alligator. You still here? - Your bow. - It's not a bow, it's a rag roller. - That right there, that's that tendon that's runs down along the inside. - [Rainie] Hey Billy. - It's a little sore isn't it? Well, we'll fix that. - [Rainie] Your dog hurt his leg. - We'll put some of this on it, time heals everything, well almost everything. - Listen Billy, I came by to apologize to your sister. - Did you? - Yeah. - Come on, let's put you back inside your house, you stay off that leg, you hear? There you go, good boy. Something I can do for you? - I wanted to apologize to you too. I like your family Billy, I really do. I mean you grandfather, and your sister? She's the sweetest, prettiest, young thing I know. - She's also a sweet, and pretty young lady, Rainie. - Yeah I know. But I don't know how to treat her Billy. I mean, you know the kinda women I've been around the past five years. I don't know how to treat a good girl. And I didn't have any sisters growing up. - Rainie come on, having sisters ain't got nothing to do with this. Sara wants to be treated with a little respect. To be treated as a different person. What would your daddy have done if he caught another man being rough with your mom? - He woulda killed them. - [Billy] That's right. - Billy! Look, we've been through a long, hard fight together. And even though our side won I don't feel like much of a winner, and I know you don't either. I mean all that pain. The killing. Just when you think this world is this horrible, terrible place to live someone like your sister comes into your life and it doesn't seem like such a terrible place after all. - Well don't tell that to me Rainie, tell that to her. (dramatic music) Want me to shoot him? I'll be happy to beat him up if you want me to? - No thanks, but I'll holler if I need you. - Okay, you do that. Rainie listen to me, okay? I can't speak for Sara, she's old enough to make her own decisions. But, if you treat her anything less than the Queen of England, Lord help me boy I'm gonna put a hurt on you kerosene won't wash off, do you understand me? - Yes sir, Sergeant. Sara, listen. - No, you listen, and you listen good buster. If you ever wanna kiss me again, you ask me first. And if I say yes, which I don't often do. Then I want you to give me a short, sweet, gentlemen like kiss. Not one of those wet, slobbery, bathe my face kisses. - Like that? - You didn't ask me first. (sighing) - Sara, may I kiss you? - I suppose. - Is that okay? - Howdy neighbor. - Howdy, how are ya? Homer Jeffries. - Billy Coleman, pleased to meet you sir. - [Homer] This is my son Wilson. - Hi. - You know we only live just a mile and a 1/2 up the road. - Yes sir, I know, I've seen you pass by a couple of times. My grandfather speaks very highly of you sir. - Billy, how is he? - Well, with all things considering I'd say he's doing quite well, thanks. - Anyhow, the reason why I stopped is to ask you a favor. My boy here has been driving me crazy to stop here and see if you might let him take a look at them dogs. (chuckling) - Is that so. (dog barking) Well sure, come on down, be my guest. - Wilson, just a couple of minutes now, we gotta get into town. - Yes, sir. - Okay. - How are you Wilson? Pleased to meet ya. - Redbones? - You bet, you a coon hunter? - You bet. - You got some dogs? - No, sir. - Tell me something Wilson, is there coom back in here? - You bet, if you know where to look. - Yeah, do you know where to look? - Well, yes, sir, I go hunting and trapping just about every night, and I do all right. Do a lot better if I had me some dogs though. (soft music) - You know I've been training these dogs for quite some time now, and I was thinking about taking 'em out tonight. You see, I don't get along very well on this leg, and I was hoping I could get some help. Think maybe you'd like to come along with me? - Yes, sir, you mean it? - You bet, why don't you go ask your pa? - I'm so excited, I hope they do good for you. - Well being that it's their first time, I'm not expecting too much. Could you pack another one of those please? - [Sara] Oh sure. - Thanks. - Where you going? - I'm taking the dogs out tonight, first time. You know your neighbor, Mr. Jeffries? He stopped by today and I asked his son Wilson to come along with me. - Oh, that's nice. - Yeah. - You're not gonna be too late. - Well no, I don't think I'll be. Why? - Well, I think tomorrow morning I'll go to church. (chuckling) - All right, would you like me to go with you? - Yes I would. You too. - Yes, sir. - Good, well good hunting, and goodnight. - He looks really tired, doesn't he look tired to you? I mean do you think he's gonna be up to getting dressed and going to church tomorrow? - I think it'd be good for him. I was thinking about asking Rainie to go to church with us. - Hmm. Gee, I haven't seen much of my ex-best buddy. Is everything okay? - He is so nice. Have fun. Thank you. - Be careful. - Well, you look like you're about ready. - Yes, sir. - Hold this. How is my gang doing tonight? Little Ann you're looking very, very pretty. And Old Dan, you're the dignified gentlemen, isn't he? - Yes, sir. - I'm counting on you two, let's not forget what I've been teaching ya, huh? You ready to do a little hunting tonight, huh? - Yes, sir, Little Ann looks about ready to go. - Yeah, she sure is, okay, grab your lantern. Now, Wilson, hold on. Wilson, see there very fired up? - Yep. - This is why you have to listen to me at all times. It's very important, hey, back! You have to listen to me at all times, that is first and foremost, you understand me? - Yes, sir. - Okay, that's why I invited you to come along, to experience this, and the second thing, you must remain quiet, okay? Do not speak unless you're spoken to, is that clear. - [Wilson] Yes, sir. - All right, now I was gonna let you handle the dogs tonight but you gotta be able to pull them back whenever you have to. - Yes, sir. - You can't let them run off on you like that. - Yes, sir. - Okay, come on back Dan. Think you can do it? - Yes, sir. - Okay, you hold onto here. And give me the lantern. Hey, are you a good runner? - Yes, sir, pretty good. - Pretty good, come on Wilson, this isn't a time for laziness now, there's a lot of endurance involved in this. Come on, suck in your stomach boy! Pull back those shoulders. You gonna be able to run with my dogs? - Yes, sir. - I can't hear you. - Yes, sir! - Let's do ourselves a little hunting. Woo hoo! Let's go! That a boy. (upbeat music) Give 'em a ya-hoo every once in a while. - Ya-hoo! - You gotta work on that Wilson. - [Wilson] Yes, sir. (dogs barking) (raccoon chittering) - They got one? - Sure sounds like it. - What do you want me to do? - Okay, I want you to run as fast as you can and follow 'em, and when you find 'em you stay with them until I get there. - [Wilson] Yes, sir. - Okay, get going. - [Wilson] Ya-hoo! - Ya-hoo! (dramatic music) - Great, now what? Mr. Coleman, Mr. Coleman! (groaning) - Damn. (groaning) (dogs barking) (dramatic music) Wilson! - [Wilson] Sir, over here, I'm just ahead of you. - Come on I thought you said you were a coon hunter? You gotta keep moving. - Which way? - There, there are the tracks, that way. That a boy, you gotta tough it out now. Woo, way to go team! Huh? You got 'em in the tree? Way to go team, okay let's get the leashes ready. Way to go Dan, my boy! (laughing) How do ya like that, first time out! - [Wilson] Now what? - Well, looks like we're just gonna have to wait 'em out. Either that or cut down the tree. - I've got my hatchet. (chuckling) - That little thing? No, we'd be down here all week long cutting this tree down with that. You know? When I was your age I used to have a hatchet like that. First time I went out coon hunting, came up to a big tree like this and I was cutting away all night long, I got so tired. (chuckling) Grandfather gave me heck for it too. We just have to sit down and wait 'em out, that's the only thing we can do. And that's liable to take quite a spell too. Let's see what time we got here. Way to go team, I'm so proud of you! It's 10:30! I promised my grandfather I'd take him to church in the morning. - Church? - Wilson, I gave him my word, I've gotta keep it. - But you gave your word to them too. - I know. - [Wilson] I'll stay with 'em. - What, I'm supposed to give you the rifle? - Yes, sir. - Have you ever shot one of these before? - [Wilson] You bet. - Well, you know Wilson there's no telling how long this ringtail's gonna stay holed up in here. I mean you could be here all night long. - Yes sir, but doesn't that also mean it could be 15 minutes from now? - Well, you got a point there. But it's more likely you're gonna be here all night long. Okay. All right, now look. This is not a toy, you understand me? - Yes, sir. - Now, hold it, put it in your hands. Now you see here, this is the safety. Okay, you keep that pressed in when you're not gonna use it. - Yes, sir, I know. - [Billy] You do? - Yes, sir. - Now, you're gonna be here awhile it's not gonna be coming out in no 15 minutes so, let's put you over here. - Come on Ann. - Let's get you comfortable. - Come on. - Come on. Come on. I bet you don't like fried chicken much do ya? - Hate it. - Yeah, I bet. Boy, you're making out like a bandit tonight. Got fried chicken, got my dogs. Got a ringtail holed up there. That looks pretty good. - I'm starving. - Say Wilson, I really do appreciate you watching my dogs for me. - [Wilson] No problem. - [Billy] Okay you guys. (soft music) - Dan, Little Ann, here you go. Here you go. (upbeat music) (birds chirping) (dramatic music) (raccoon chittering) (dogs barking) What's happening, did it run? (upbeat music) (shot gun shooting) Ya-hoo!

(screaming) - Hey, come back here! (screaming) (dogs barking) - Come on Billy, we're on the trail again. We're just about to get him. - Wilson! - Mom. - [Mom] Where have you been young man? - [Will] I'll go get them dogs. - You better answer me. - Coon hunting. - Coon hunting! - Yes, ma'am. - Mrs. Jeffries I can explain everything. - And where did you get that rifle? - Billy gave it to me. - Billy? - Mrs. Jeffries, no, no Mrs. Jeffries. Listen everybody, I'm really sorry about what happened this morning. (laughing) - That wasn't your fault son. - Well, I was partially responsible for that. - Well, if you ask me, Mrs. Jeffries was completely out of line. But she swings a mean purse boy. (all laughing) - Or when my leg landed in her lap. (all laughing) (soft music) - Billy, did you have a little bit of fun out there during the hunting? - Well, to tell you the truth it's not like what it used to be when I was a kid. But then again, I'm not a kid anymore. - Rainie and I have an announcement to make. - Well listen, as you know me and Sara, we've been seeing a lot of each other. And well, I've fallen in love with her. (soft music) And I was thinking if it was okay. - Rainie's asked me to marry him, and I said yes. Gosh, I kinda expected you'd be happy for me. Well, aren't you gonna say anything? - Grandpa, I'm gonna knock his head from his shoulders with one hand tied behind my back. - Billy! - I'm gonna help ya. - [Sara] Grandpa! - Does that mean I have your blessings? (all laughing) - [Sara] Grandpa! - What is it honey? - Grandpa, Rainie and I are going into town, can I bring anything back for you? - No, no, I'm just fine, you go ahead and have a good time, be careful. - Feeling okay today? - I feel just fine. - Okay, you get some rest, I'll be back in a minute. - Feel like I'm kinda running out of gas. - Son. Your father and I have had a long talk, and he feels very strongly about this, we're gonna let you have your own dog. - A coon dog? - No, but Mr. Davis down at the dry goods store has a brand new litter of chihuahuas. - I don't want a stupid chihuahua, I want a coon dog! - Well, I am sorry sir, but you are not going out hunting coons with dogs, and running all over the place, and staying out there with a loaded rifle. Wilson, Wilson honey, I love you too much, I'm sorry. - Hello, is Mr. Renfro there please? Mr. Renfro, how do you do sir? My name is Billy Coleman, I sent you my resume a little while back, I was in charge of my outfit's radio operations, yes sir. Oh you did, okay. (chuckling) Yes, sir I think I could start right away. Oh no ca, no, I've been to California, I stayed there a little while when I was in the Marine Corps. No, I'm sure I would, I'm sure I'd love it. But sir, this is happening a little fast. My grandfather, he's not feeling very well right now, and I can't leave him at this moment, yes, sir. Well that's nice, I really appreciate that. No, thank you, and I'll keep in touch. I'll let you know what's happening, thank you for being patient. Right, thank you sir, bye-bye. Come here, Little Ann, come here. Now you stay here, you understand me Old Dan, stay. I'm sorry, but you just can't go with us this time. I know you wanna go big guy, but we just gotta let that leg of yours heal. (upbeat music) Little Ann, come here girl, you stay. How's my girl doing tonight, huh? Ready to go, huh? You stay Old Dan. Okay, let's go. Good boy. - You gonna need to double that wire won't ya? - No, need to, now with him, he can't figure out how to open it anyhow, now, if it was her, I'd have to chain it closed with a combination lock. Of course you'd probably figure out the combination wouldn't you girl? Let's go. Where do you think you're going? - Well, I'm going with you. - The heck you are, Sara would skin us both. Don't be ridiculous grandpa, you probably haven't been coon hunting in over 10 years anyway. Grandpa, I can't take you. I'll tell you what, I will make you the warmest pair of coonskin slippers you ever had. How 'bout that? - I'd like that. - What do you think you're doing? - Like I said, I'm going with you. - [Billy] No, you're not, I'm not gonna let ya. - How are ya gonna stop me? - Don't make me lock you up in the kennel with Old Dan, then I'll have Old Dan and old man, how do ya like that? - If you think you can put me in that kennel with them dogs you just get right at it mister! I ain't had a good tussle in years. - Grandpa come on! Please, I don't want you to come, okay? You're not invited. Not invited. Can't you take a hint. - You're right you know, I'm an old man, if you think for a minute you'll have to wait on me, don't worry about that. You know I could out run you in a foot race before you was a one-legged smart aleck. - Okay, fine, you suit yourself, but I' am not gonna hold up for you, you understand that? - You won't have to. (dramatic music) - You okay? - [Will] I hope you're not waiting on me. (Old Dan barking) (owl hooting) - Well, listen up now, we let that coon dog flat outsmart us last night, you know it, and I know it. But I feel different tonight, tonight's gonna be better. You just have to, well you have to stick to the basics. Pay attention to detail now, and I know you can do it 'cause you've turned out to be one crackerjack coon dog. You know that? You know you're on your own tonight, but let's face it, you happen to be the pair of the two with the brains, good Old Dan, what he lacks in brains, he definitely makes up for in determination. Girl, come on. You gotta stick with 'em you understand? Don't leave there until you're done. And I'll be right behind ya. - I will too. - Now, I might take a little while to get there, but I'll get there. - And I'll probably be just ahead of him. - Not a fat chance. You gonna get me a coon tonight? Are you girl? Huh? Go on, go to it girl. That a girl. Ya-hoo! (Old Dan barking) (upbeat music) (Little Ann barking) (Old Dan barking) I think that old coon is fooling us again. - Could be. - How 'bout a breather? (upbeat music) (Old Dan barking) Over there, you hear that? - She's on to one son. - Yep. (chuckling) Woo! Dan, oh dag gonnit, how'd he get out of there. - Maybe next time you'll double that wire. - No Dan, you big dummy, not that way! I'll tell you what, you go after wonder dog, I'll go after Little Ann. - I'll tell you what, you go after wonder dog, and I'll go get the coon. - All right we'll flip for it. - Heads I win, tails you lose. Good luck with your dog, and say hello for me. I'm coming Annie! I'm coming Annie get the coon, get the coon. (upbeat music) (breathing hard) (upbeat music) (whistling) - Dan! Idiot. (whistling) Dan? You see? I was afraid this might happen. Yep, sure was. You just had to come along didn't ya? You and grandpa. Now what are we gonna do? You can't walk on that can ya? This is just great. Lord, I'm stuck out here with a crippled, dense, hard-headed, aggravating animal! Well now what? Well forget it pal. There's no way I'm about to carry you outta here. Man I'll tell you what, I'm gonna put you down for a second. Okay, let's set you down now, easy. No, easy, easy, steady, you okay? Dan, you are a load. I don't think I'm gonna feed you anymore biscuits from now on. (Little Ann barking) I knew it, you hear that? Your sister's treed a coon. (Little Ann barking) I knew it. (breathing hard) Let's look at your leg. It's gotten real sore. I'll tell you what, I don't know why I put up with you so much. Life just isn't fair is it? That'll do. Let me catch my breath before we continue. Smell something? What's out there? You picking up on a trail are ya? (upbeat music) Hurt leg and all. Awe, you're just kidding me aren't ya? There's nothing out there. (Old Dan barking) Dan! I wish you'd give me a warning, Dan! Dan. Dan! Dan! Where'd you go off to now? Dan? (soft music) What the heck are you doing up there? Dan, what the devil are you doing? You just can't stay out of trouble can you? Listen, if you think I'm gonna come up there and bring you back down again, you're crazy! Dan, I mean it, get down from there now! Wait, stay, stay right there. Don't move. I'll come and bring ya back down. Dang it dog! Lord. I get my leg shot off in the war, you'd think that'd be enough bad luck to last me a lifetime, oh no. I gotta get a stupid dog that likes to climb trees all of a sudden. Wagging your tail like a stupid fool. You don't know how much trouble you're in. You sure know how to get into trouble, you know that? You certainly don't have the brains in the family do you? (Little Ann barking) - What a good girl. (laughing) I'm proud of ya sweetheart, you got him up there, he ain't going nowhere, let's go wait for Billy. The old man's gotta get his air. - Dan I need you to turn your head around, just to look at me, okay? I know you're surprised because we're very, very high up, and I don't wanna make you react more. Just listen to me, okay? Dan please, we gotta use our heads about this now, we're in a lot of trouble, just listen to my voice. I'm gonna come and get you, okay? Just stay right where you are. Dan please, Dan. (dramatic music) Oh my God, Dan, no! (dramatic music) Dan? Dan? Boy? Dan. Dan? (crying) ♪ I'm better bred than old dog Trey ♪ (chuckling) Who's coming? Billy? Bill, what happened son? - Fell out of a tree. - Oh my God. Sit down honey. Oh Dan, my God. Are you all right? (crying) - You know grandpa. (somber music) I always thought I knew what fair was. You taught me that. When I was a boy running through these forests I learned how to trust, and care, and believe in life, I always have. I've always done my part. - Well, it don't seem quite fair does it? Your leg, and your dog. But you know, nobody said it was gonna be fair, or easy. Your dog done what he was bred to do. I'm gonna tell you something now I learned a long time ago son, I learned that if you surround yourself with living things, sooner or later you're gonna watch 'em die, and that ain't fair either! Hell I don't know the answers, I don't even know the questions. I'm gonna tell you something else. You know, you talk about these woods and I don't know what makes these trees turn green in the spring, and shed these leaves in the fall. And I don't know what makes them creeks run downhill, and I don't know what makes that dog crazy to get a coon in the tree. I don't know what that is, whatever that is, whatever that power is it's a heck of a lot bigger than me or you! And I feel like sometimes I have to give thanks to it and call it God, I don't know what fair is. I don't. But I know that dog gave his life doing what he was bred to do. And I know this one ain't dead. She treed a coon you know? I think it'd be fair if me and you went and got it. I love you my boy. And I wanna help you through this, and I don't understand. Maybe I'm too old, maybe I never was smart enough. You oughta meet me halfway. (crying) Let's go. Come on Little Ann! Come on Little Ann! - I'll catch up with you. - Come on sis, come on. Catch a coon, catch a coon. Catch a coon. (grandpa coughing) Not now, not now.

Wilson, I decided to take a job in Los Angeles, I'm gonna be moving to California. - [Wilson] Can't. - [Billy] Why not? - [Wilson] I don't think they coon hunt out there! (chuckling) - Well, you might be right there. And that's why it's important to keep the spirit of coon hunting alive back here. So I want you to have Little Ann. - [Wilson] I don't know if my parents will let me, I mean. - [Billy] Well, I think they will. - Can I have her? - You promise me you'll be careful? - [Wilson] I promise mama. - Okay.
