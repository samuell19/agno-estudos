Aino... Esko wants to talk to you. Damn. I'm not good at talking about the affairs of the heart - but what I have in my chest is beating for you. I'm talking about an engagement. I want to take care of you. Just look into your heart. Take your time. I already know... - Take your time. Think it over. Your father and I have already come to an agreement. You'd sell me to become a murderer's wife! I wouldn't if the situation wasn't pressing. -Never! If we don't do it, our farm will go under the hammer. Kalle and Matti are in a barn near 0nkeloinen's bog. Hello. Are you back on your feet? I'm hungry as a wolf. I ran into Kantola's maids. I told them where we are. I have to marry Esko. Otherwise we'll lose everything. But it's you I love. Take your clothes off. A worker's hand. But not a farm owner's. It's wonderful that you're the way you are. If the law doesn't come to Esko, we need to bring Esko to the law. Jump onto another cart, Valtteri. I'll follow you later. Young love is oblivious of time and place. -Be quiet. Leave me some liquor. Have you thought about it? -Yes. Well? Is a bought wife enough for you? - Is your heart on offer too? I know which way the wind blows. - Now it's taken a complete turn. It takes time for the heart to follow the head. -There's no rush. We have all the time in the world. I seem to have a rival. Shall we kill him? - I was seen. Let's sink him. -That wouldn't do. We'll take him to a boat and to the province capital. We're doing what's right. We 're going to America And get some proper work there We'll find handsome sweethearts And come back to show them off You can always hear my voice Although I can't be seen I'm just a rotten charlatan A tiny boy, but mean My heart is big and pounding hard For my little sweetheart If I could lie down next to her I'm sure we 'd never part Let him drown! - I'll untie his hands! Aino, it's all right. I'm taking her ashore. You're going to the other side. Matti, there are two of us! No... -We have a score to settle! Is everything all right, Aino? You're not cold? It's all right. Must've been terrible when they forced you against me. Everything's all right now. Your fancy words about the heart following the head... Do you think it's happening? I want to tell you one thing before you answer. I would never hurt you in any way. Never! But I can't stand the sight of any man who has your heart. Can you understand that? It's important to me that you can. I don't have a ring right now, but all the same... Will you be my wife? Where's the Notary'! - Didn't we already... Where? - The men have some business. I don't know. I can pummel you all night. I have nothing to lose. I'll tell you! -No! He's in jokikulma. Wouldn't less have been enough? - I didn't have time to try. Good morning! Aino and I came to show off our rings. They're wide and thick - so people won't have to guess whether we're engaged or not. Aino came to get her things. She'll begin to settle in our house. Esko is a sick animal. He needs to be locked up. You have to do something! Life can take you where you don't want to go. Esko is good to his own people. Your heart will follow, if you're patient. Are you ready? We'll send for you to celebrate the engagement. Valgard! Come outside. It's Matti Valitalo. Father, come outside! Shall I go and get him? -No. Hello, Matti. I hoped you would come. I've been ashamed of howl ran away. I've been thinking. I'd be glad to tell the authorities in the capital- how things really are. We'll get a bigger one, once we go to town. Esko? Tapola's younger brother is here. He wants to talk to you. These damn things aren't easy. How to tell when it's right to mind just your own business? Things you can reach with your own hand. To do what you have to, so you get what you want. And when should you know how to look further? To bear responsibility for things you have to stretch for. I believe we all must weigh up those things sometimes. One's own good and that of others are rarely the same thing. And everyone makes their decision on their own. There are not many around here who can set an example. I need to piss like a fire brigade's horse. Why don't you go inside? I'll be right there. Christ! Your face is droopy like a wet nurse's tit. Everything will be fine. Except for Aino. You think she did it of her own free will? Sometimes I think you're a little stupid. Stop that. Even a fire brigade's horse doesn't piss this long. I've seen this so often that there's no room for doubt. “I've seen this so often that there's no room for doubt.“ He slipped the rope around his own neck- climbed onto the railing and stepped down. Esko has bought that man. We should shove him into a crack in the wall. We should've taken the longer route. What are you doing? Finding out how tough a fighter Esko Valitalo really is! The cognac ran out at the wedding $0 we started drinking liquor We were dancing at the wedding And all I got was leftovers I picked a fight with Esko Valitalo And started to run riot Esko just laughed at me And stabbed steel into my belly I was lying on the floor My guts were in my lap I waited for life to escape my body It's a handsome way to die Look at you. I'm surprised you didn't stab me in the back. Not everyone is like you. I've noticed that you're quite a competent man - even though you're an orphan. There's a place for you here, if you want it. I do... but the head of the house needs to be replaced. I see. If you can survive him, I'll think about it. Here we go. Esko Valitalo hung a bay on the wall Who was wet behind the ears You should've stabbed me in the back. Did you come to celebrate the engagement? -Is Kalle here? Oh, you're running after a man We're not the same after all. Is he here? Now that you're here, you should congratulate my bride. Aino! Come and say hello to your brother-in-law. We're cleaning up the place for guests. Hello. What's this? What's this? - One has to follow one's heart. I never would've guessed what was in store for me. Are you here of your own free will? Yes. Yes, I am. Get the coffeebread ready. Aino? Aino! How are you forcing her? -I'm sorry things turned out like this. It's all right. I'll wipe it up. Yes, about Kalle... I think there's someone round the corner. How does it feel when no one loves you? Do you feel like ripping heads off? Or stabbing a knife into flesh and twisting it a little? You think you're better than me? You're just the same. You won't believe it until you've gone to the other side. Sooner or later, you'll do that. And there's no turning back. Come and brag about it then. I don't know if we're the same. But a man isn't measured by his words - his thoughts, or his feelings. He's measured by his deeds and the reasons for them. And those will never be the same with us. You'd like to try out who's who, wouldn't you? Do you think I'd start playing with knives with you? Who would do such a thing at their engagement party? Valtteri? Take a horse and get the Police Chief. He needs to arrest a murderer, whom I caught red-handed. Witnesses saw him stab a man to death. You're going to Siberia, Matti. Who knows what else you've done? It's a good thing that Father isn't around to see this. For your own and Aino's sake, if there ever was anything - forget it all. Why are you doing this to me? What's wrong with me? I froze my heart because I knew I'd lose you. How can any mother be so selfish? Never mind. I should be patient. I'll wait until the priest has done his job. Good night. Don't be long. Aino! I'm coming in. I come in when I feel like it. I don't ask for permission. You'll bear a son for me and keep yourself fair - so you're presentable even after childbirth. Do you understand? No one can be trusted. Except for you, Mother. No matter what, I can always count on you. Goddammit! I understand that you have to say goodbye. Or things will bother you. That can't happen between us. I came to say goodbye. So you promised yourself to Esko. After everything we talked about. Yes. There's no use for this now. Take care. Esko sent his brother to Siberia Away from under his knife He even took his brothers bride As his own sweetheart I need to go. - You can piss right there. I'll fall off if I start crouching with these chains. May I go behind a bush? - Make it quick then. Valitalo? Can't you cut it off? Do you need a knife? Matti has escaped! He managed to open his shackles somewhere after Kankaanpaa. Do you have to raise hell about it? Every man would escape, especially a Valitalo - if there was a chance and even if there wasn't. Let's surprise Aino and get the priest to marry us right away. Aino? In case you think of going somewhere or harming yourself- or you drive a pair of scissors into my lungs, I'll give an order. Lehto? If that happens, make sure - that Aino's mother will bury her husband, son, and daughter. I'd be happy to. Mother? I'm going out. In the meantime, try the wedding crown on Aino. Good afternoon. We need the priest at our house. - I'll come after I'm done here. We need you now. Don't you feel any shame? - This is a deathbed. So you don't need a priest but a gravedigger. The priest will come when he's good and ready. Your family don't have a replacement for you. You don't want both the child and his father to die? The priest is needed right now. Get the hell out of my way! Was that the priest? I don't understand you. I hope you'll have only one son yourself. Well? -I can't marry anyone before the banns have been read. Here's part of the congregation, so read the banns - and do it three times, so you'll get it right. In the name of the Holy Trinity - and in the face of this congregation... I hope he has the good sense to stay away from here. Matti. Here comes the first guest! Give the Police Chief a generous wedding drink. What are you celebrating? - The King's wedding. No... -Don't bother to resist. It'll be easier that way. I'll kill myself. - You're just nervous. I understand. You're going to run a big household. You're so beautiful. My ring isn't enough to tell you how my heart is about to burst. I do. I ask you, Aino Kantola, Sakari's daughter- in the name of the Holy Trinity and in the face of this congregation - do you take this Esko Valitalo, Antti's son - as your husband, and love him in sickness and in health? Do you even have to ask? There's always room for a crasher at a Valitalo wedding. What's an escaped convict doing here? If I'm the last man standing, you'll tell the whole truth. And if I'm the last? -I suspect I'll be carried away lifeless. What the hell! Iron may break, but a man's word is not fake. Make room, so we can dance. The boy didn't even bring tools with him. Throw some steel to the poor thing, Koskela. You've saved my life twice. Was it worth it? Your soul isn't white either, whatever you may think. Father, Valgard, and Kalle! Many mothers are crying because of the both of us. We're the same. We're the same, Matti. Look at that. More wedding guests. That's fine. There's plenty of room. You're quite a small crowd. I see you've brought wedding presents too. It's time to restore law and order in this parish. There is a law here, my law. I'm your king. That time is over now. - Says who? Is my father-in-law your leader? - This is a common cause. I see. Is that so? Common cause... Who else wants to end up in the churchyard? No one? No one? We're not the same! The wedding will continue in a moment. So now you're feeling remorse? Let Matti go! The priest will finish the ceremony. Esko! Don't do it! All right. The groom changed on the ﬂy at the Valitalo wedding. That's a good line for my song. You'll get yours too. Although it doesn't matter anymore - tell everyone about Father's will. What will? Do it. Don't hesitate. From ear to ear. Go on. Matti is telling the truth. Matti is telling the truth about everything. Esko is lying. Matti is telling the truth about everything. Esko is lying. Be quiet, Mother. He probably killed his father too. You're both my sons. Watch out, Matti! The axe! Two of a kind. FARM OWNER ANTTI VALITALO FARMHAND KALLE ESKO VALITALO, ANTTI'S SON May God protect your coming in and going out- now and forever. Will you give up the Devil? - I will. And all his deeds? -I will. I baptise you, Kalle Valitalo, Matti's son- in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Subtitles: Minna Franssila Broadcast Text International
