Fanny, Seng, come out! - What's the matter? - Go... To the studio! Go! Telephone. Cut the line! Drop it! Follow me. Hurry up. The camera is ready. Welcome to our new sprung Shojenomichi Television Network. I sincerely hope that you would assist me... in broadcasting our next programme world-wide. Have I made myself clear? Any questions? The audience would rather watch a smiling hostess. Don't you agree? So now, try to smile. Miss Anita, smile! Mr. Takizawa. Is everything OK up there? Let them in, but no exit! I'm going upstairs to see a friend. Call the police, quick. Find another phone. find it outside that way! Let's go. The lifts are locked. Use the stairs. Idiots! Kill the two bugs! Show time! Let's go. Take a look upstairs. Come out! You coward! Go. You'll be dead soon! Shoot him! Come out. Hurry. Why didn't you shoot? They wouldn't have died if you hadn't hesitated. For the sake of Uncle Lam, can you behave like a cop for once? Let's get started, show the Hong Kong police a good time. Are you the person in charge? Yes, this is the superintendent speaking. Who am l speaking with? I'm Takizawa Ryuichi of Shojenomichi. We're prepared a television programme for the Hong Kong police. Trace the call! There's no need to trace my call. What do you want? Mr. Takizawa? Simply turn on your TV set, and you can find me on the 5th channel. Bring me the TV set! Call Secretary for Security and Police Chief. Hostages are either on the roof and in the studio. What do you think? You know the Chinese saying a snake can't move without its head. Our priority is to capture Lone. If we cut off their electricity we might have a chance to surprise them. Don't just talk without action. At 8:30 Hong Kong time. Shojenomichi of Japan... successfully invaded Satellite TV station. The main purpose towards the occupation of TV station... is to request the Hong Kong police... for the releasing of Mr. Yoshinaga, the leader of Shojenomichi. ln one hour time, they hope to see Mr.Yoshinaga sitting onto the plane to Russia. If not, the members of Shojenomichi will...Deputy... Deputy Japanese Consul... I'm afraid you are not a very good broadcaster after all. If the Hong Kong government refuse to co-operate. We'll execute Acting Japanese Consul Narita right here. And l'll also activate this chemical bomb. which will cover Hong Kong with sarin in less than 10 minutes. These people want to ruin Hong Kong. A police car is coming. Mr. Wong, l prefer no disturbance from your men. Kill them all! Let's start the game. Take cover... Sir, they killed the first batch of 10 hostages. These people are crazy and daring. Did you find out the number of hostages & their stronghold position? Sir, we are not sure yet, approximately 200 to 300 people. But the OP and heat detector have confirmed. The stronghold position is at Studio One. OK, print out all the information. Special Duties Unit is on their way. Sir, anti-terrorist negotiator has arrived. Simulation-attack team is standing by. Good! l want everything ready in 15 minutes. Prepare to give our SDU a final briefing. Did you get in touch with lnspector Ching's team? Try another channel. Sir, they will not change any channel. What does that mean? It means that maybe Ching and the rest of them are dead. I have made myself very clear. We'll withdraw upon the release of our mentor Yoshinaga. We intend to keep our promise as long as you'll keep yours. Mr. Takizawa, we have to get permission from the Security Council... before we can set Yoshinaga free. - In the meantime... - I don't want to talk to you. Give me your incident commander. - I'm the incident commander. - I don't care who the fuck are you. Listen, one hour later, if I don't see Mr. Yoshinaga sit into the airplane to Russia, you will pay twice the price to learn the lesson. Nobody moves! Drop your weapon or I'll blow his fucking head off! It's too rush, there is only a 50% chance to attack enemy in there. The possibility to rescue hostages is only 25%. I don't care. You guys are the best in Hong Kong. If you don't do it, who else will? Then my men will suffer casualties. Casualties? All my men had died! The negotiator has started their tactical negotiations. You and your men will attack the enemy in 15 minutes. - Did I make myself clear? - Yes, sir. - We take action in 15 minutes. - Yes, sir. Don't be naive. Hong Kong government will not release Yoshinaga. Our purpose is money. I don't want to die. You never understand, did you? You talk about money. All snipers in position. Ken, where are you now? I'm in a kind of a tape library, just next to the studio. Nice to hear from you again. Me, too. I'm in a control room, above the security office. I'll come over, don't go away. Charlie 2, situation report! All clear. A few silly rats are coming up. This is what you call your Special Duties Unit? Charlie 1 compromise, lA stand-by. Go, go, go. Take cover! Medic, gun shot, double. Medic, on the double. Charlie 1 withdraw! Charlie 1 withdraw! Charlie 1 withdraw! Whole team withdraw! This is an order! Go. Are you sure? You call yourself incident commander. You know nothing about combat tactics, do you? l'm sorry for you, man. Superintendent Wong, Yoshinaga is here. OK. Mr. Takizawa, we have something very important for you. Mr. Yoshinaga has spoken to our Minister of Security. He's not going anywhere. Instead he wants to talk to you in person. He's now on the screen. Leader, please hang on for a while. We are able to rescue you very soon. Takizawa, Hong Kong government will fight against Shojenomichi. We must fight the sacred war till the end. Send him away right now! It's time to turn on our satellite broadcasting system. The Hong Kong government has made an irretrievable mistake. by disobeying Shojenomichi. I would like the world to witness the punishment. that such a government deserves. I, Ryuichi Takizawa, Special Unit Commander of Shojenomichi... apologize for the harm I'm causing to the people of Hong Kong. Hong Kong will be destroyed in 10 minutes. We must cut off this live satellite broadcast. But the bomb will still be activated. He is scaring us! How can he escape in an explosion? Lone's never thought of leaving this place. But we still have time. Takizawa, don't be stubborn. I joined your group for money. I don't want to die. Please give me back my gun... OK. You are more nuisance than woman. I thought I will never see you again. It's OK. Don't be afraid. How did you find this place? Say no more. Which floor is the satellite's engine room? - 20th floor. - Take me there. Hurry up! Will we die? No, we will make it through! Go. Go to hell! Sir, satellite is not working. Mr. Takizawa, satellite transmission is interrupted. It must be that two fellows. Get someone to fix it. Yes. Move...! Mr. Takizawa, when are we retreating? - What should we do now? - What to do? Leave the place! It's useless to be frightened. You all will die sooner or later. Bingo! Killing area ready, take your opportunity target. Everyone on the floor! Don't move. Drop the gun...! Hurry up! Don't waste your time. Beg me. Hurry, inactivate the bomb! There isn't anyone who can help you now. What's going on? Get me all the fire extinguishers, now! OK. The bomb up there is explosing. Evacuate the people! It's very dangerous here! Leave now! Quick! The compress gas is frozen. I don't think we can stop the bomb. Remove the sarin now! It stopped! Let's go. Go. I'll follow you. - I'll carry you. - Go. Come with me. This is an order from Captain Takami. Come on. Please... I'll wait for you. Wait for me, my friends, I'll be there soon.
