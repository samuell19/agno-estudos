SONORA a little vilage in MEXICO, 1880 Hurry up, Dad. We gotta get outta here 'fore somebody comes in. I'm hurrying. Keep your voice down. - Sure you got it all, Dad? - Yeah. You about done? - Yeah. - There's another. - Good morning, señor. - Good morning, señor. Come on, kid. Come on, Doc. Walk out. Walk out. Easy. Come on, kid! Wait a second, Dad. Young lady's trying to cheat me here. - Hmm? - Please don't hurt me. Whoa. They stole everything. They took everything. Look, there they are! What's the matter? Ain't you coming in? You can fight them fleas on your own. I'll see ya later. Well, don't get drunk! You're getting too fat to run! Let's go to glory, Dad! - Do you make your home in Mexico? - My home is... oh, just any place I throw my saddle down, I guess. Oh, then you do much traveling. Yeah, I, uh... you might say that. I drift into one town out of another and... Well, I transport money for the banks once in a while. You have a little something in your eye, señora. Oh. Is it out? No, I... if you'll permit me, I think I can snag it out with this. Just... close it. I have made the mistake of thinking that you were a gentleman. Now perhaps you'd better leave. Please go. All right. I never did get much upbringing as a kid. All the manners I learned was in a saloon. I didn't have much chance to be around fine ladies like yourself. I'm sorry, señora. I just hope that... you don't think too bad about me when I'm gone. Perhaps you were a little impulsive. You may call again if you wish. Señora, you just don't know how nice that makes me feel. Stop! Follow me! - There. - Mmm. - Dismount and follow me. - Yes, my Captain. Listen, spotters. The final four go behind. The others follow me. - You, go the other way. - Very well. Support horse. Do nothing. Wait I say. Come on, look everywhere. Search the place! They are coming. Come out the window! Your Shoes! Your shoes! Underneath the bridge. - No! - Gett off me! No! Get off me! My mother give me this ring just before she died. It'd mean a lot to me, señora, if you'd wear it for me. I couldn't. I... I couldn't take that. Please. It'd make me feel a whole lot better. It's... it's very beautiful. I shall be honored to wear it. Oh, thank you. Hey, kid! Kid! You in there, kid? - Yeah! - Come on! Get on your horse! Rurales! - Come on! Get on your horse! - Where's Doc? - He's dead. - Be right with ya! What is it? Sorry, sweetheart. Maybe next time. All right? - Give me a pull on that. - Yeah. Here. Hey, Dad! Come on back here! Come on. Take the gold! Get the gold! Hurry up. Come on, come on. Up there! Where's your rifle? I dropped it coming up. Let's go down, guys! Now hide! Mountain , let's go! Let's go! No, hold it. We ain't gonna do no good from here. They'll be stomping all over us inside an hour. We'd better think of something funny, and quick. - Well, we still got the horse. - Well, what good's that? You remember a little stick place just outside of San Felipe? With a corral? No. Yeah. Remember, that was when you was drunk and killed that lady's goat? Remember? - Yeah. - Well, listen. If I ain't wrong, I think it's got to be four or five miles right down that canyon there. Isn't it? Well, that's no damn good. If we rode that horse double up, she'd cave in on us before we went half a mile. Yeah, but one of us could stay and hold this rim and the other one go get us fresh mounts. Ah, slim chance. Well, it's better'n sitting here, waiting to get shot all to hell, front and back. - Huh? - Yeah, it might work. - We ain't got no choice. - Well, who rides and who stays? Well... let's shake up for it. Bullet rides? Bullet rides. You ride. I'd get the hell out of here. I'll see you right quick. - Kid. - Yeah? - Yeah, I could use it. - Don't go away now. - Huh? - Wasn't thinking of it. Come on! Come on! - Hey, kid. - What do you want, boss? Whose? - From my father. - Go call him. Papá! - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Look... - How are you? - Very good. How much... how much for those two horses? How may I serve you? - Those two horses. - But I will not sell those horses because... cost me a lot of work.... Say, how much? - How much? - Two hundred-weights pesos. - Two hundred pesos. - Come on, Manuel. Come on! Give me that. Thank you. Jorge! Carlos! Go and grab him! Stop! And I can't disperse! Hello, friend, do you saw a foreigner to come by too rushed? Yes, Captain, a very bad man, and it was there. And had no shoes. No shoes, huh? The horse is that? Yes, sir. And he took one of mine. - He paid him, no? - Yes, sir, paid. - How much? - Very little. Say, I wonder what happened to your friend, huh? Well, uh, maybe he goes back to find the shoes. Well, come on, guys. Come on, guys. PRlSON OF SONOR 5 YEARS LATER Refreshing. We get to my woman's place, she'll get us horses and clothes. - You all right? - I'm all right. Well, let's go there. I've been thinking, amigo, about this Longworth. Must be very hard to find him. It's a very big country. I know all his old stompin' grounds. - Sooner or later I'm gonna find him. - Five years we spent in that stinking hole. 'Bout time we live a little. - What if he's dead? - Then I'll find him dead. You could spend the rest of your life looking for this man. Let's get going. Cinch up. - Good evening, gentlemen. Can enter. - Meet a man who Dad Longworth is called? I know nothing. Gordito. - See what these men want. - You want, sir? Meet a man who Dad Longworth is called? - Do not know. - He's an americano. - Come on, Mom.... - Want to know what there is.. Do not want to come? Want or Not? They do not want to enter. Come on. Where were you? - Over there. - Outside. Dime. Say, Dad Longworth knows? Who? Dad Longworth is an American nose fat. No. - Want a slice of lemon? Here. - Look at me again, will you, please? Boy, you've got the reddest eyes. - Always say I'm in love when my eyes turn red. - Easy with that knife. You both friends, you're enemies. You're both friends. You're both friends of mine. - Please. - Yes. Be good! Better dig something you can eat, bub. Good night. What do you mean by that? Hey, you boys, you wait here, and I'll be back right away. - Aw. Where you goin', Red? - I'll be back. I think she's tryin' to get us drunk so she can take advantage of me, Harv. Kid. - Kid, you remember me? - Sure do. How you been, Red? - Very well, very well. How are you? - I'm all right. What are you doing here? - Just killing time. - Oh. It's five or six years since I see you. Hey, I hear you got in some bad trouble. - Ah, a little bit. - Mmm, that's bad. Hey, what happened to your friend? Well, I don't know. I kinda lost track of him. - When was the last time you seen him? - Not since he was here with you. You remember. When the rurales came and killed that guy... Hey, Chihuahua! Maybe he run back over the border. Yeah. Hey, Red, what you doing over here? I'm over there. Ah, just one moment, baby. I'm coming right away. I'm here talking to an old friend. - Come on, let's go. - Just a minute. She'll be right back. I'm just asking her a few things. Ask her questions on your own money, bub. Let's go. Come on. - Just a minute. Just a minute. - Let's go. Come on. Don't be doin' her like that. - What'd you just say? - I said, don't be doin' her like that. You know, I've had just about enough out of you, jackass. Well, Harvey Johnson's gonna be a famous name round these parts. You're gonna get yourself killed by a fella called Rio. That ain't him. It ain't, huh? I wouldn't want to lose me a handful of brains tryin' to find out. Now, would you, Harv? I don't care if it is him. You don't, huh? My name's Amory. I'd like to sit down with you and buy you a drink. Got something I'd like to talk over. Be right back. Mind if I sit down? Oh, don't pay no attention to him. He's just pumped up a little. You must have heard of me. Bob Amory? Nope. Well, don't matter anyway. You know what's a real piece of luck? My running into you like this. Got a good idea I'd like to talk to you about. How would you like to get rich once and for all? You could stand a piece of change, couldn't you? You got something to tell me? Fourteen days' ride from here, there's a town. And in that town there's the fattest bank you ever saw. And it ain't nothin' but a cheese box. What are you telling me all this for? - I'm gonna need some help to take that bank. - How come you don't do it on your own? Two men ain't enough. I never saw a bank two men couldn't take. That's true. But this is a little different deal. Word's going around that you're looking hard for Dad Longworth, that there's dirt between you. Now, if that's true, I can tell you where you can find him. Want me to keep talkin'? Mm-hmm. Now, here's where the fun comes. And it's gonna tickle you. The sheriff in that town is Dad Longworth. Now we gonna do some business? Yeah. Well, there she is. Monterey, California. You know, I think of the money waiting in that bank, just makes me wanna cry. Harv, you gonna have diamonds in your teeth. And you ain't never gonna have to take that bath. Come on. Let's get down there and pick them apples. You go in there and get the rooms. I'll be back. Looking for somebody? Looking for Dad Longworth. Could you tell me where I could find him? What do you want with him? I wanna see him. Who wants to see him? I do. - What about? I'm the deputy. - I don't believe you could handle it. - I asked you polite. - Read that sign? I got a lot of funny things to do today, but lippin' with you ain't one of 'em. I'd say you was shy a few manners, mister. You're looking to get your back busted, sonny. And I'm the man that takes care of them kind of things around here. Well... could be you get your chance to try it. Hey, can you tell me where I can find Dad Longworth? - Oh, Dad's over at home. - Where's that? About two miles out of town. You take the south fork plumb to the beach. Yeah? His is the first house on the west side of the road. Dad. We have a visitor. Somebody's coming. Darling, give me my holster, please. - What's the matter? - Never mind. Just give it to me. - Who's he? - Close the window. Stay inside. Hello, Dad. Hello, kid. Well, how you been? All right. - How 'bout yourself? - Oh, I'm sneakin' by. What's on your mind? Nothin'. I was just driftin' through. I thought I'd look in on you. I knew you'd be coming sooner or later. I'm glad you come, because there's something I been wanting to tell you for a long, long time. How 'bout a drink? All right. - Look good, Dad. - I feel good. Sit yourself. Well. Remember the last time we had tequila together? Sure do. That was up on the mountain when we was hung up there. Remember? - About five years ago. - That's right. No, just... yeah, that's right. It was just under five years. I, uh... I guess you wondered why I never showed with the horses. Yeah, I thought about it. Well, you know, knowin' how you was in them days, I... figured you for gettin' drunk and fallin' down onto some chiquita and losing track of time. No, I didn't forget, kid. But there was nothing I could do. When I got to that little ranch, there were no horses. That old Mexican couldn't talk American, and when I finally figured out his lingo he was saying that he had sold the horses a couple of weeks before. The old paint horse I was riding was pretty done in, but I headed straight for you. When I got to the canyon, I see rurales all over the place. Well, I... I high-tailed it out of there and got as far as La Quinta before the horse caved in. I hid out in a cantina and I gave the bartender some gold to keep his mouth shut. Well, there wasn't too much of that, as I recollect it. There was enough to get me over the border and all the way here. Here to Monterey. I figured I'd keep my nose clean until the... till that, um, fracas down in Mexico was forgotten. Well, I kept myself clean. Clean enough to be elected sheriff. Knowing me the way I used to be, I... I couldn't blame you for not believing. But if you're looking now to be satisfied for what I did, I'd be sorry for it, kid. But if that's what you want, just let me know how and where you want the play. I'll stand up to you. You're gettin' way ahead of yourself, Dad. No need for all that, 'cause nothin' happened to me. I just fooled around with them dogfaces till it got dark. Then I went down and stole the captain's horse. They wasn't about to find me neither. Then after that it was just, you know, rosemary and sweet whiskey and... just whoopin' and yellin'. You sure that's the straight of it, kid? Well, you know me, Dad. If I didn't feel right about it, we'd have been out there splatterin' each other all over that front yard. I admit I was hot about it for a time, but that's five years ago. A man can't stay angry for five years. Can he? You know what you're gonna do? No. You're gonna stay to supper. Well, listen, Dad, I... I tell ya, I was just pokin' through and thought I'd stop in and say hello. - But it wouldn't look good, me hanging around. - You let me worry about that. Well, now, you'd better think about it, 'cause... I'm still in business. I want you to meet my family anyhow. - All right. - Good. Come on. Maria! Just a minute, kid. Maria! I want you to meet an old friend of mine. Maria? Hello. Hello. Are you waiting for my father? Yeah. - Would you like to sit down? - Yes, I... I would, thank you. - Who is he? - I want you to meet him. Ah. I'm glad you're here. Rio, I want you to meet my entire family. My wife Maria. - How are you? - Ma'am, it's a pleasure. - And have you met my stepdaughter? - Just that little. - Well, this is Louisa, my stepdaughter. - How do you do? I love her as though she were my own natural child. - Uh, Rio's staying to supper. - Wonderful. We're happy to have you. - Well, I don't want you to do any fussin'. - Oh, no, there's nothing... No, no, no, no fuss at all. You wanna wash up? Yeah. Take his hat. "Heavenly father," "in thy graciousness thou has seen fit to grace this table with thy divine bounty." "We offer up our humble thanks" "and ask that you bless this food to our use, and us to thy service." "And make us ever mindful of the needs of others. In Jesus' name. Amen." I never knew you to pray over the grub before, Dad. Yeah. - Have you known each other for a long time? - Oh, yeah. Dad and I go way back. I wasn't anything more than a kid when Dad picked me up. I have never heard him talking about you before. - Well, we was kinda hairy in them days. - When he was a bandit, no? Oh, that's all right, kid. Everybody here knows I used to be on the other side of the law. Yeah, we were a couple of cockleburs, we were, huh? Had a lot of fun, didn't we? Always full of laughs, Dad. You know, it's a wonder we didn't get our fool heads shot off. That or wind up in the pen or something. Lucky. - Just luck, huh? - Mm-hmm. Of course, that was a... that was a long time ago. - You were a bank robber, Mr. Rio? - Yes, ma'am. Me and your dad here. - But no more. - No more. Will you be in Monterey long? Well, long enough to get my horse shod and do a couple things. And after that, where are you going? I don't know, Mrs. Longworth. I thought I might go up to Oregon. That's awful pretty country up there. Thought I'd go take a look. Will you be here for our fiesta? - When is that gonna be? - Well, tomorrow and tomorrow night. But you will not be able to buy any shoe for your horse because everything will be closed. You mean, the barbershop and the blacksmith, bank and all? - Bank, everything'll be closed. - Yes, so why don't you stay here? You heard señor. He's going to Oregon. Well, you know, I just... I just could lay over a day or two. Don't expect too much, kid. It's just a street dance, that's all. Well, must be enough there to give a man a laugh. Then you will stay? Well from such a lovely young lady I don't know as how I could rightly refuse an invitation. Yeah, I'll stay. Don't tell me they're for real. Yeah. Well, I don't know about you, kid, but it's been a great day for me. For five years it's been tearing at me, and I'm sure glad it's all under the bridge. I'll bet. Good party, Dad. - You tell the missus thanks again for me. - Yes, I will. - Good night, Rio. Thanks for coming. - My pleasure, Dad. Good night. I say I got a right to know where you been. Just so's there's no misunderstanding, Bob, as far as what I do goes... you ain't got no rights at all. Just so as you understand me... I didn't ride 900 miles to come up empty. Bank don't open till day after tomorrow. What about Longworth? Nothing about him. When the bank opens, I'm gonna kill him. Oh, welcome to the party, and we hope you enjoy yourselves. Every year we have this fiesta to remind one another that we're neighbors, friends. Also, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for electing me to another term as sheriff. I want you to know that I appreciate it... and that I will continue to do my best to make this city and, well, to make this county a place where we can be proud to raise our children. When... Oh, that's it. Let's have it! Come on! Give me some flowers. - What kind would you like? - Oh, it don't matter. - Violets are very nice. - Yeah, that'd be all right. Good, what about? How much for that thing on your neck there? This? I'm not selling that. But I'm glad you like it. I like it $20 worth. - I couldn't sell it. My husband gave it to me. - I like it $30 worth then. Well, all right. Very nice, but... $30? Just a little birdseed. - Hello, Marta. - Hello, Helen. - Mrs. Longworth. - Hello. - Louisa. - Hello. I just wanted to tell you thank you for a very lovely evening you gave me last night and say I appreciated it very much. Well, I'm very happy that you like it. Thank you. Thank you very much. - Hey, Rio boy! - Well, there he is. - Are you having a good time? - Well, I didn't get started yet, Dad. Hey, listen, I saw you makin' that speech out there and kickin' up there. You must be a big man round these parts. - Well, I try to fit in. Don't I, mother, huh? - Yes. - You really having fun there. - Yes, I'm really having fun! Aren't you? - What about that dance? - Never mind. What about "you" dancing, huh? Doggone, that was all right, Dad! - Howdy, Mrs. Longworth. - Hello. Say, this is our dance, isn't it, Louisa? Oh, I believe Miss Louisa has been spoken for. Haven't you, Miss Louisa? - Uh, pardon me. Excuse me. - Later on, Lon. A day late and a dollar short, huh, Lon? Come on, let's get some of that beer. Come on! Dance it up! Hey, Louisa! Louisa, I think your mother could use some help. - Excuse us. - I'll be back. The barbecue stand. - Well, Dad... - Well, I... I don't believe I ever met your friends. Name's Amory. - Amory. Bob Amory? - Yep, that's me. - Yeah, I seen your picture in the post office. - You must have heard of me, Sheriff. Johnson. Harvey Johnson. Well, gents, the laws loosen up a turn or two during fiesta time, but tomorrow I'll be back running a pretty tight town. So as long as you fellas'll be haulin' out in the morning, enjoy yourselves. - You bet. - See you later, Sheriff. - Let's go, Harv. - Yep. - Where did you pick up the crow bait? - Well, the pickings are slim these days, Dad. We don't hardly run into studs like you no more. Yeah, I guess it's about time to say good-bye. Rio, I want to tell you something before you go. In all my life, I've never met anyone like you. I'm so sorry you're going - because I would like to know you better. - If you knew me better you might wish I hadn't. Oh, no, I'm sure not. Good-bye, Miss Louisa. I thank you for everything. Rio. - Howard... - I've been looking for you. Listen. You go on and have yourself a good time and I'll climb on your back. - Well! - I want to talk to you. - And I want to talk to you! - No, but this is serious. Here I thought you ran away with a harness salesman or something. What's serious? Let's go home, huh? Just for a little while. Let's go home. Oh! Please! Now, really. - Here! What? What? What? Huh? - Wait a minute! - It's about Louisa. - What about Louisa? I haven't seen her for an hour. And I don't see your friend either. Well, that's not awful. - Please. Please. - What? Why don't you go and try to find them? - Not now, not now. No. - Yes, now. I say now. Please, Mr. Longworth. Now. All right, Mrs. Longworth. I'll find her. But I'll be back. All right, you go now. You're drunk! Huh? - Chet! - Hi, Dad. - Hello, Lizzie. - Hello. - Chet, have you seen my gal Louisa? - Let me fire you up. No, no, we don't mix it, do we? Yeah, she was dancing around with that fella over there a while ago. - You look very handsome tonight, Sheriff. - Well, so do you. Enjoying yourselves? There you are, my friend. What do you see? What you see an empty glass! - Ladies and gentlemen, I told you... - Let's go home. Let's go home. Go home? I'm having myself a little fiesta! Huh? Me! Dad Longworth! Hey! Get up! Come on! Get outta there! Get out! - This is mine! - Get out. This is my beer! Attaboy! - Where is Louisa? - We'll get Louisa. - Let's go. Come on. - Where is Louisa? She's around here somewhere. She's with that Rio fella. - I have to go to find her. - Sit still, Mrs. Longworth. - But we should bring her home! Please! - I'll take care of Louisa. I'll see she gets... - Get his foot back in there. - You promise me that. I'll take care of it. Tim, drive on now! Drive careful! I'll see that she's all right. I'll take care of Louisa, Mrs. Longworth! Don't worry about nothin'! What's the matter? I was just thinking that you're the most decent woman I've ever met. I'm sure you have met many nice women in your life before. Yeah, I met a few. But not many like you. Something I want to tell you, Miss Louisa. I... lied to you about myself. I told you I was just a drifter and that ain't true. - I work for the government. - Why did you lie about it? Well, I had to. I was sworn in under oath not to talk about my job. Anyhow, I'm going to Oregon tomorrow, but not just to look around. I'll be gone as long as four or five months. You're to come back to Monterey... sometime? Yeah, I'm hoping to. Miss Louisa, I don't have much time to court you. And I... I ain't exactly what you'd call a high-bred gentleman. But before I go I want you to know that I think you'd make a man a wonderful wife. And I know I ain't got no right to say this, but... - I want you to wait for me. - I don't know what to say. You don't have to say nothin' now. I was just hoping you'd think about it. Yes, I will wait for you. You don't have no idea how good that makes me feel. I don't have much of anything to give ya. I don't have no ring or nothin'. All I got is... this necklace here. My mother give this to me just before she died. And it'd mean an awful lot to me if you'd wear it while I'm gone. I will very proud to wear it. I will miss you very much. But I will write you every day. Where can I write to you in Oregon? I ain't going to Oregon. But you must go. I don't want to keep you from your work. I don't have no work. I make my living robbing banks. What do you mean? I mean that... everything I told you about last night was lies. You lie? Yeah. About everything? Yeah, just about. But your mother's necklace... True? I never knew nothin' about my mother. I bought that thing off a girl for 25 bucks. Well... That's about it. It ain't gonna help much to say it, but... I shamed you. I wish to God I hadn't. You only shame yourself. Scare ya? Out kinda late, huh? What are you doing here? - I reckon I know where you been. - I was just walking. Let's take a little walk, you and me. One more ain't gonna make no difference. Get out of my way. Dad. Dad! It's me, Lon. Sure am sorry to get you up this early, Dad. I hate to tell you this. - She's been out all night. - Who? Louisa. With that Rio fella. How do you know, Lon? I've been round here half the night, and she just this minute come home. Looking kinda messy too. Sure hate to be the one to... the one to tell you, Dad. Lon tells me that, uh... you were out with Rio all night. Is that true? No. Then why are you still dressed? Why hasn't your bed been slept in? Hmm? Answer me! - Were you with him? - Yes, but... - but... - But what? What? What? - Nothing happened. - Don't you lie to me! I'm not lying to you! We just walked on the beach! - That's all? You just walked on the beach? - Yes! - We just walked on the beach! I swear that! - What's the matter? What's happened here? What is it? Louisa, what happened? Mother, I want to speak to you for a moment. Louisa, what happened? Where have you been all night? Did something happen? Answer me! Mother, I'm waiting! I think she's lying to me, and I want you to find out. - Louisa would never lie. - I hope you're right. Louisa. tell me... slept with him? Why, Louisa? Why do it? Because I believed he liked me. It was a lie. Excuse me, Mom. Forgive me. Child! Was she telling the truth? Yes. - Are you sure? - Yes. - But she was out with him all night. - She's all right. You keep her in her room. My little girl. There you are, gents. Here's some hot coffee for you. - I guess you can use it after last night, huh? - Oh, what a night. Hey, hombre. - This horse is still fighting for his life. - That's what you got a sharp knife for, friend. Barney! It's a party. I told you I'll be with you in a minute, Howard. Wow, it pains me . Oh, what a night we had. What a night. Now what do you want? We're bone dry. So bone dry. - Give us some more whiskey. - What do you want to eat? - You got any chili? - I'm not hungry. - Take a nice drink for yourself. - Use this one. - Come on, drink up. - I don't want any. Please. - Drink up. Be a nice girl. - The night's over with. Grab the glass. That's it. Now, come on, drink. - Let's see you drink. - No, I don't want any. Why not? Drink, you cow. Come on, drink! Drink it! - Here. - That's it. - That's the way you gotta treat them, Barney. - All right. - Three bits for each, pay it. - Wait a minute, they don't wanna eat. - You owe me six bits. - Wait a minute, Barney. She's gotta have something to eat. I don't want my little girl to starve. - Please, I'm sick. - You gonna eat? - Go on about your business. - Come on. Take it easy, now! Get it out of here! This is a nice place. What do you think you're doing? You're gonna give me a dollar so I can pay this man. - He's mad at us. - Please, ah, he's breaking my arm. - You gonna be good now? - Will that be all? - Yeah, just about. - Thank you very much. - How are you, sonny boy? - Good morning. You get up, you big tub of guts. - You will see what is good! - Easy. - You will see what is good! - That's enough! Get off me! Thinking, I'll kill him too! I'll kill you, I want to kill him. Wait. Beware! If I told him once, I told him a thousand times something like this was gonna happen. Well... it finally got him. - Mister, you really killed him. - All right. I better take care of this. Beast is what you were. They killed you at last. - Get off me! Get off me, I'm telling you! - Walk. Now what do we do, amigo? This don't change nothin'. We just wait for them two, and get on with it. Let's get us a drink. - Hello, kid. - Good morning, Dad. - How'd it happen? - We took to scuffling, and he come out from behind there with that scattergun. - Sounds like him. - Yeah, he didn't give me no selection. He was always askin' for it. If it hadn't been you, it would have been somebody else, I guess. Well, better get him out of here. I'll bring the coroner over. - You fellas give me a hand. - Yeah, you bet. Let's put him in the rig. Kid. Think it'd be a good idea if you'd hand over your gun. All right. Ephraim. Yeah. Ace. Tim. Lon. Left hand, kid. Dump it. Lon. Come on. I warned him not to cause any trouble around here. But no, kid, you ignored my warning and went right ahead and killed a man. Didn't you? Well, we don't want his kind around here. I'm going to teach you a lesson you'll never forget. Now, let's see the kind of stuff you're made of. That's a pretty good start. Look here what's happening to Romeo. - Oughta get down there and do something. - Do something? Not this horse. Enough shotgun down there to start a war. 'Sides, it might help him to get rid of some of that snot nose. What's this gonna do about the bank? Well, we'll just have to kiss that good-bye for today anyway. Now what do you say, kid? You better kill me. - Kill you? - Yeah. Nah. No, there's no need for that. Your gun days are over. Untie him! Ephraim! Bring the horses here. Now, I'm letting you go. But if you ever come back here again, I'll shoot you down like a dog in the street. All right. That's all. It's all over now. Go on. Back home! Whew. Man. Slashed you clear down to the rib bone. Yeah, we're sure sorry about that, Rio. We got in on the tail end of everything, and there wasn't nothin' we could do. It's all right, Bob. The place was crawling all over with deputies. You know me, Rio. If there was anything I could have done, I'd been in there like a streak. - I said it's all right, Bob. - Well, what's it gonna be now? There's a small fishing village up the coast a couple of miles. It's called Punta del Diablo. When we get there, what then? We'll just wait. Just wait. Think you can make it that far, Rio? Say, they really did mash that hand. Whew. Looks like it might be all broke up. Yeah, I guess you won't be doin' no business with that for quite a spell. Well, there's no need for you to hang around, Bob. It ain't that, Rio. It's just that I'm thinking of you, that's all. Come on. Let's go. No! What? We need some rooms. My friend is sick. We need a place to stay. - How many rooms? - Four. - Phew. What is that? Fish? - Somethin' dead. - Hey, where can we get a drink around here? - There. Howdy, Miss Louisa. Wait a minute. Boy, you're just as pretty as a bird on a limb this morning. Say, I heard from a friend of yours. That fella, what's his name? Uh, Rio. - Thought you'd be interested. - Really? What about him? Nothin'. He's a-hangin' out down at the point, lickin' his back. How would you know? Somebody smelled him, I guess. Four weeks. I think the hand is finished, kid. It's not going to get any better. Let it go. Let's go back to Morelos and lay in the sun. Forget this Longworth. He's not worth it. Huh? What do you say, amigo? You must be crazy. Hey. Take them stinkin' fish out of here. I'm through with the fish, Harv. That, and them damn waves floppin' in all day long. Six weeks in this puke hole, and listen to him. That hand ain't gettin' no better. How's the hand, Rio? Oh, it's coming. You know, Rio, I've been wondering if we oughta lay around here anymore. Throw me the dipper, Bob. I've been thinking a lot about all that kale waitin' in the bank. How 'bout the dipper, Bob? I'll tell you what we're gonna do. We're all gonna lay for that sheriff outside his house some sunup. Cut him down with scatterguns and then take that bank. That's not my style, Bob. It ain't, huh? Well, maybe you better change it 'cause your style seems a touch slow to me. I'm getting tired of listening to that bull. We rode 900 miles because you were supposed to be the big man with an iron. But the way things are going, I think even I can outpull you now. Probably could get six into me... before I got that one into you. Huh, Bob? Do not want to get up, baby? It is 8 o'clock în the morning. Come on, get up. So many things to do and I'm here. Louisa. Louisa, why did not you answer? Louisa. Louisa. Mamá. I'll have a child. Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. - Hello. - Hello. How are you? I'm fine. Are you all right now? Yeah, I'm all right. Want to sit down? How'd you find me here? - Lon told me. - Lon? I don't know how he knows. Well... Don't matter. I'll be gettin' outta here pretty quick. Where are you going? You know, I'll figure that out when I've finished up with Longworth. Finish what? I'm gonna kill him. You're gonna kill him? That's right. - But why? Just because he whipped you? - Yeah. That, and a couple of other things. I know it was a terrible thing, what he did. And I was ashamed for him. But those are not reasons for to kill a man. Reasons? I got reasons. I got 1,708 of 'em. That's how many days I spent down in that lead mine in the pen in Sonora. That's how many nights I spent digging the maggots out of the sores in my ankles, with the rats running all over me. I laid awake for five years at night, listening to men screaming and praying - while they was getting beat to death. - I don't understand. You don't, huh? Well, it ain't hard to understand. Five years ago in Mexico, we was caught on the hill by rurales. And he run off to get fresh mounts. And he never come back. He was the best friend I had, and he left me there for rot. And you know what for? Two sacks of gold. Are you sure he did this? Yeah. Well, that's my sad tale. And when it's over, I was hopin' you'd come away with me. After you murder him? That ain't murder. That's just standin' up, same as any man would do. And you think to kill him will make you a man? I don't know about that. But I know that I thought about him every day for five years. And that was the only thing that kept me going. Rio. There are not many chances in life to be happy. And I think that we have a good one now. Won't you try to forget this? Forget it? Not as long as I breathe. Rio. Rio. Please. Please try to forget this. Please just take me with you. We can be very happy. Can't you forget? - Can you forget all... - I can't. I can't. Don't you understand? I can't. I gotta die to forget that. Then... I'll be going away too, because I don't want to be here when they bury you. I love you. I know that, my sweet man. I love you. Wait a minute. You must've had some reason for comin' all the way down here. Yes, I did. But it doesn't matter now. Mr. Modesto, I'm gonna raise you for a bit. Boy, that's... that's too rich for my blood, Bob. - The New York Yankee takes this? What a fate! - Well, now, thanks for the donations, gents. How 'bout some of your cash there, Romeo? Man oughta dig up something forbeing around this manure pile. Huh, Harv? That's right, Bob. You know, maybe the boy's all petered out from playing on the beach... with that little jumpin' bean. That's right, Bob. He should have shared with us. Get up, you scum-suckin' pig! Get up! I want you standin' when I open you up. Now, get on up. Go on. You got right on the edge. You mention her once more, and I'm gonna tear your arms out. Guess we forget about the bank tomorrow, huh? Yeah. What are you gonna do now? I'll be going in after her in the morning. What about Longworth? I just pray to God I don't run into him. - You ridin' with us, Modesto? - I don't know. You going back to Mexico? I just might. - What do you think about it, Harv? - Might as well. Nothin' else to do. How 'bout your friend? Is he still set on going in after that female? Yeah, I guess so. I don't know. - I'm gonna say good-bye. Then we go, huh? - All right. kid. We'll be riding out now. I just come to say goodbye. We rode a long way together, buster. That's right. - You think of me once in a while, no? - You bet. You bet. I'm gonna miss you, bean. Hey, listen, you get tired of around here, come to Morelos. I got a little place down in Tepoztlán. It's not much, but you can live quiet there, huh? I might do that, kid. I just might do that. - Well, goodbye, friend. - Goodbye, boy. You take care now. Rio! Goodbye, friend! Take care of yourself! - Goodbye! - Goodbye! Hey, where you going? That's the wrong way, no? Uh-uh. This way. - That's the way to Monterey. - That's right. We're going to take the bank right now. - I mean, just the two of you? - Kind of figured on maybe three. You in, or you out? Not me. That's no good. We go in now, we make a lot of trouble for Rio, you know? - If we wait, maybe. - We're all through waiting for Rio. No more waitin' and no more takin' that bull, 'cause he ain't the big man no more. I am. - Now, you comin' or not? - Not me. And neither are you. You gonna try to stop me, mixed-blood? Yeah, I'm gonna stop you. Well, now, Modesto, I'm... I'm real disappointed you pulled on an old sidekick like that. You're gonna give Rio time. I tell you something. One more word out of you, and I cut you in half. One more word, huh? Let me see. Maybe I can think of one. Yeah, I got one. G-R-E-A-S-E-R. Greaser. Try it again. I'm real disappointed in greaseball. Ain't you, Harv? - Sure am. - Maybe this is what you're looking for. Eat 'em, greaser. Damned. You had a good life, mixed-blood. Let's go. - Wait here. I'll be right back. - All right. Hey, Longworth! Longworth? Mornin', Sheriff. Rio said to tell you wait here. - What for? - Said he was comin' in to kill you. You tell him I'm waiting. All right. I'll tell him. - Good morning. - Good morning. Hold on. I'll be right with you. Deposit? Not hardly. Where's your hog leg? I ain't got none. You ain't got none? You better dig one up. Right there. Pretty fancy. Give me the paper. Forget the hard stuff. Good morning, Mr. Carvey. Has my father been here yet? He was here a little while ago. Now, honey, you're gonna be a real good little girl, ain't you? You're not gonna scream, and you're not gonna run out of here, are you? No. All right, then you get over there in the corner, and sit down, and you won't get hurt. Now, you better get busy or I'll blow your liver out. That's it. I'll take that. - What do you reckon that was, Lon? - It ain't the Fourth of July. Let's go. Harv. - Hey, Barney? - Yeah. - Where's Longworth? - I don't know. - What happened? What happened? - I been shot. Whoa! - Hi, Sheriff. - Hello, Dad. Dad, all hell broke loose back in town. They shot up everything. I run one clean out of town. I done the best I could. - Tell me what happened. - They held up the bank. That's what happened. - Who did? - Rio's bunch. The teller got Bob Amory, and the other one got away. They killed the little Ames girl. What about Rio? Didn't see him. Smart. Thought maybe they got you. That's why I come out here. They got me, all right. I'll be right back. - Thank you. - Bye. Hold it, Rio. Get your hands up slow. You're all right, Dad! Dad, I didn't mean to take the law into my hands, but I did what any person would do. Take care of this one, Dad. I want to fix his wagon. - Take the bucket away. - I don't need the bucket. You know that? Who'd he ever stand up to later? Get up there! - Cut that out. - Shoot. I seen the big whupping you give him. - Get him! - Stop! - Get him better that. - I'll remember this. You'll remember nothing. Now, get back! You're gonna get yours. Hear me? You'll get him, Lon. Oh, no. Come in. Hurry it up. Hurry up. Come on. Outside. That's all. You too, Lon. Well, that's it, kid. I guess there's nothing more to say. Dad. Got a minute? Sure, kid. You know I didn't send Bob Amory in there to tell you to stay home. Well, I could be wrong. But then I'm not going to be judging you. Those folks out there will. They'll be your jury. You're dying to get me hung, ain't you? No, kid. You've been trying to get yourself hung for the past ten years, and this time I think you're gonna make it. You should have quit when you were ahead. Like you, huh? Mm-hmm. Like me. You're a one-eyed jack around here, Dad. I seen the other side of your face. You know where I spent the last five years? Rottin' my guts out down in that pen in Sonora. Now, what you think of that? I think you're lying. Faster than a dog can trot. - I am gonna get a trial, ain't I, Dad? - Oh, sure, kid, sure. You'll get a fair trial. And then I'm gonna hang you, personally. Rio? I had to come. I'm glad you did. I was kind of hoping you would. You're lookin' fine. Just fine. Maybe if we had seen each other again, you would change your mind. Louisa, I wasn't coming in after Dad. And I don't know nothin' about that bank. I was coming in to take you away with me. - I was gonna ask you to be my wife. - It is true? I ain't got no time for lyin'. Listen to me. I want to tell you something. I am going to have your baby. - Why didn't you tell me before? - Because I was afraid. I thought that you don't want. No. He will be something wonderful... because he is our love. And you will be very proud of him. I love you, Louisa. I never did get a chance to say it. I want you to know something, that... - I'll be thinking about you tomorrow. - Don't say that. They will listen to you at the trial... and they will know that you are innocent. But you must believe that. You bet. All right. Let's go. Come on. Sorry to have to break up this little Valentine. You heard me. Step back. Turn around. Get ahold of them bars. Keep your feet back. There ain't no call for that, Lon. What's the matter with you? Nothin'. Just sorry the county's gonna take care of him. I'd like to do it myself, with this, with both barrels of double-aught shot about waist high. Want to? Let's see you pull it, Lon. All right. Go ahead. Make a try for it. There ain't no need for that, Lon. All you got to do is just squeeze one off. Go on. You're supposed to have so much guts. Mm-mmm. You're the one with the gut, Lon. Second thought, maybe it'd be more fun to wait till tomorrow. How's your face gonna look? All turnin' black, and your tongue is stickin' out. - Why don't you just shut your big mouth, Lon? - Why don't you tend to your own business? You're forgettin' one thing, Lon. Yeah? What's that? Ain't hung yet. Yeah, but you will be, brother. You ain't gettin' no older than tomorrow. Oh, say. Let's don't forget about her. I'll be taking care of that before they cut you down. You gob of spit. I sure am, ain't I? You watch yourself. What's the matter? Aren't you hungry? What is going to happen to him? What's going to happen to who? Is he really going to be hanged? Oh, of course he is. Could it be that you have your own reasons for wanting him to die? No. No reasons at all. He just, uh, robbed the bank and killed a little girl, that's all. Why do you ask? - I hear you might have personal reasons. - Personal reasons? Like what? Oh, the story about you run away from him in Mexico and leave him to die. Did you? Is this truth? I've heard that story. - Where did you hear it? - He told Louisa. Smart pup. It is the truth? The truth? Why, he'd choke on the truth. Now, what the hell is the matter with you? I will tell you. Louisa's going to have his baby. Yes. Please listen to me. You have been good to us, and I'm grateful. But if I talk to you so, it's because I don't want my daughter to suffer as I did. - Then you lied to me that morning. - Yes, I lied to you, but... Shut up! Is this the thanks I get for taking you out of the bean fields and giving you respectability? I gave you the clothes on your back. And I gave you a roof over your head. And what's more, I gave your daughter my name. Mine. When she had none of her own. Everything you say is truth. - But now she needs your help more than ever. - Help? Yeah. I'll help. It's taken me five years to build this decent life. - I'm not gonna stand by, let him ruin... - Killing him will not help! - Let go my arms. - Please. - Let go of my hand! - Please! Don't lie, please! - He's guilty, and he's gonna pay. - Don't lie to me anymore. I saw it on your face since the first day he came here. Your hatred is more important to you than anything, including our own lives. And you will do anything to hide that memory of what you did to him, even to kill. I told you to shut up. His execution will be a day earlier. That's all. What do you think you're doing up here? Get on back down them stairs. I brought him something to eat. Tell you what. Why don't you just trot on home, 'cause you ain't gonna give him nothin'. My father told me to bring this, and you're supposed to give it to him. He never said nothin' to me about it. All right. I'll tell him that you refused. Wait a minute. Let me see it. - What do you got in here anyhow? - That's just some stew. Just take a little peek. You're not supposed to touch that. - I love you, Rio! - Come here, you little runt. I love you! I love you! Now get back! Take your hands off her! Get your damn hands off her! Get off me! Get off me, animal! Get off me! - I'll stick a fork in you! - Get off me! I'm taking you out of here and let Tim keep you till your daddy gets back. That's right, Lon. Now, up in here right quick. I count eight, and I ain't got them keys, I'm gonna take you off at the neck. One. You ain't about to take my neck off with that little old popper. - That's two. - You'll be lucky if you hit the wall. Three. I might get shot up a little bit diving down these stairs, but you're gonna hang any way you put it. Four. - You're runnin' a bluff, and I'm gonna call you. - Five. Go ahead. Try it, Lon. Six. All I gotta do is duck a little bit, and you're done. Seven. - That's eight. - I'm comin'. Open that door. Easy now. Now turn around and come in here backwards. Step in here. Left hand. Take that belt off. Down on your knees. Lookee here, Lon. Wasn't loaded. Get back, you. Get them keys out. Take them chains off. - Now... - Oh, please, God, don't... don't kill me. You remember, Lon? I told you I ain't hung yet. - Sorry, I don't want to die! - How you gonna look? How you gonna look, Lon? Kickin' and snappin', spittin' out your blood. - Oh, please, don't kill me. Don't. - Huh? Get on up here. Get on up, Lon. Get up! Now just turn around and get your turn. Don't move. Get up. Get up. You get in there and send me the best horse you've got, and quick. I ain't got any. They're all gone. You're gonna die if you're lyin'. Get... turn around, you. Put your hands down. - McKittrick around? - No. He's... he's over to the saloon. Oh. Help! Help, somebody! Help! Tim! - Get off that horse. - Somebody help! Help! He's gettin' away! Help! Dad, it's me up here, Lon! You killed Dad! It's all over. Wasn't nothin' else to do. - Come on. - No. Come on. There's nothin' to do. - I gotta leave you here, Louisa. - Yes, you must go now, quickly. I want you to tell your mother something. I want you to tell her that I tried to run, but he didn't give me no chance. And tell her I'm... Well, just tell her whatever you have to. Will you be all right? - Where can you go now? - I don't know. I'll have to figure that out later. Maybe Oregon. I'll be ridin' for a while anyhow. Why don't you go to Mexico? I could meet you in Sonora in April. - After my baby comes. - No, I... No. They're lookin' all over hell for me in Mexico. That don't matter. Listen. You be lookin' for me in the spring. One of them dark nights, you're gonna see a jackass in the window, and it's gonna be me. Don't worry about it. I'll find someplace. I better start kickin' now. Go. Please, go. I love you, Rio. Take care of yourself, because I'm so afraid to losing you. Farewell, my sake.
