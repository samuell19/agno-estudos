Who is it? It's the police. Please, open the door... Good morning. Good morning... Is Mrs. Olga at home? Olga... What is it? The people from the police need you. What?s happened? Sorry to bother you, but the lady here has reported you have kidnapped her baby. Kidnapped her baby... Me...? How could I... in the wheelchair... I'll kill you if something happens to him! Jesus Christ, is she drugged? Hold her!- So, madam, you claim that you have never seen this boy... He's beautiful child, but I've never seen him. Stop it! Please... tell me where were you around ten o'clock this morning? Where could I be? Home. Can I come in? Sure, enter. You stay here. Quiet! This is my son. He was ill. He died recently. My condolences. This is his room. He left it like that. The boys will take statements. We need to check everything... Sorry to have bothered you... If I were you, I'd check her first... Why's that? No reason, just a manner of speech... FINE DEAD GIRLS OK... yes, who told you that? OK... good, I'll speak to you later... The neighbours say that Mrs. Olga has not left her apartment in three years because of her illness... and some of the tenants suspect you... What? Me? Yes, they think you've killed your baby and now blame Mrs. Olga... Is that what you think? Maybe they helped her kidnap him... Who? The tenants. Why would they do it? Because they are crazy. When I met them, I thought they were ordinary people, but then I realized they just pretend to be normal... The worst was her Daniel. The one who died? What did she tell you about him? That he was ill and then died... She lied. So, he didn't die? He did. But not the way she told you... I don?t know... probably nothing would have happened if... What? What happened before... Before? Here, girls, you have everything here... The phone... the heating. It's warm enough... There's the tub, the oven... Everything you need... That's the ex-owner of the apartment, the late Ms. Lazarin... poor woman, she fell under the train. It's not worth the price we agreed. Three hundred, advance payment. This is my wife Olga. So girls, have you made up your mind? OK... Don't get offended, but the earnest money should be given immediately! Thank you... excuse me but do you work or... How are you going to pay, will it be on time? Well, Iva is a medical student... Wow! Really? Isn't that nice? We'll have a doctor in the building. I'm on the third year. ... and I earn. How? I teach. What do you teach? Nanbudo. Like our president... In the apartment above you is doctor Peric, gynecologist. He used to work in the hospital, but now he has a private practice in his flat... Come on, leave the girls alone. Go to the shop and do something, help Daniel. Go! Kitty-katty, come on... This is Me. Rukavina's cat, he lives upstairs. Girls, do not bring the boys here, you know, ...we have some children in the building, and the people want to have their peace. Come on, kitty, come on... good girl. Here, girls, here is your key, you can make a copy yourselves. We don't lock the entrance doors, this is a quiet neighbourhood, nothing ever happened. The candles are in the drawer, here... Our neighbor, Mr. Lasic, was in the war and can't sleep at night, so sometimes he plays marching songs. ...not often, two or three times a week, and then my Blaz goes downstairs... ...and turns off the electricity in the whole building. So, girls, that's it. Bye bye! Thank you, goodbye. What a den, ha? It's gonna be great. Come on, pickup the broad... Hey, girls, need some help? No, thank you. I'm Daniel, I work here, so if you need anything, just drop by. See you... Good morning. Good morning, madam. Did you call? No, not me. It wasn't you? No. And that thing, under your eye... I fell... in the bathroom... I slipped... So, it wasn?t our husband who did it to you? My boy, where were you when we needed you to fight the Chetniks? I'm not talking to you. Why did you call us? It wasn't me. Our girls wanted to call the ambulance, but dialed wrong number... Everything is possible! There is a man outside. He is staring at us. Why are you afraid? There's nobody out there. Go and see what the two of them upstairs are doing. They are moving in, what else? And if they destroy the floor? Let them destroy it. You know how I feel about that flat. As if I didn't know how late Ms. Lazarin signed her will, and how you got the flat... As if I had killed her! And Daniel, you don?t think of him! have to rent flat, like others. Ms. Lazarin has a son, too, and he had to rent on apartment. Miss. Lidija lives on the ground floor. I am looking for Mr. Maric, Mr. Nikola Maric... Nobody by that name lives here. Then I'm in the wrong building. Wow, look at that car. Please, enter, Lidija. What is it, bitch? Fuck off, you motherfucker! You whore! I'm finished for tonight. What, you need it badly, ha? Let's make a deal. Sado-maso is out of question, doesn't matter that you have given a thousand kuna. I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about. You know, you hit me, I hit you... But, I have a friend, if you are interested... I'm not that kid of man... OK I'm telling you now, so later you cannot say you didn't know... Where are you going? Put on your clothes. What the fuck? Please, don't use bad language in my company. Have you dressed? Yes you can come in. I just want to talk to you. Why, is your wife deaf-mute? Why do you think so? Men usually ask from me what they cannot get at home... It is very important, please sit down. Do you believe in God? That's what I thought. You're a priest. No, I'm not. But I believe in His word and it is crucial that you believe too in order to comprehend the meaning ...of what I am about to tell you... It is about the two girls who moved in this building this morning. Are you enjoying? Yes, I am. Did you enjoy with Dado, too? With Dalibor? With Dalibor... I cannot understand how you can fall for somebody whose name is Dalibor! How come you remember him? He is a real asshole! I had a great time with Dado! I don't want to know. Really, I could call him, ha? Wouldn't that be nice? You know what, you?ve been bit too loose in the last weeks... You smile at everyone... I don't know is it because something's funny or because you're happy... Imagine we are at the seaside... ...lying on the beach alone, there's nobody near... Rambo is relaxing! You motherfucking Chetniks! Good morning, how are you? Give me some wine... some red wine. Oh, we have an elegant customer, don't we? Mind your own business! Watch your language! Oh, you are a tough guy... Watch your language, will you! I could tell my old lady, and she'll send you flying from your hole ...with all your dolls and stuff. Go fuck yourself! What deal? Fuck off, will you, I just woke up... ...haven't had breakfast yet. Besides, we made a deal, once a month, and it hasn't been a month since the last time. What if I want it right now? Now? Yes, now... Come. You mean here? Yes, here. Let me lock first... Are you afraid that your mummy will come? Who's afraid of mummy, you filthy whore, come here, come! Hi! He! What kind of wine have you got? Only this. No white wine? OK... You'll pay other time, I don't have the money now, I mean, I don't have the change... OK. Thanks. You're welcome. Please, neighbour, my husband had spent all the pension money on drink again, I'll give it back to you... I always wait for you, you already owe me two thousand... Believe me, I'll give it back, I have to feed my girls. Don't mention the kids! You should be happy you get the money with no interest rate! Oh, here comes our beauty. How are you? Fine, thank you. That's right, sweetie. See how beautiful she is... we took some really nice girls. Yes, really nice. She's bit skinny but I think she's great for my Daniel... I want to see the money by Friday, understood! Sorry to bother your, but I always get lost in this city. All the buildings are the same. I'm looking for Dr. Peric. Who? Dr. Peric... I'm coming. Here I am... Oh, lady Bara, you again? I'm embarrassed, doctor, but the kids have played in the hay again. They played mummy and daddy, ha? Oh my, don't hit the child... Sweet baby, don't be afraid, it won't hurt. You go upstairs, go on, Bara, take the children up. I apologize, but, you know I'm out of cotton wool, and I thought I might borrow some from you... ...I mean, two girls, you probably have some... Yes, come in. What's the matter Ivica? What do you want? You want me to do to you the same things I do to Daniel? I told you already that your father would be mad if we did it. Hi! Go now, Lidija is busy now, go and buy yourself an ice cream. Hi bb! How's work? Oh Mr. Neighbour, how is your wife, has happened to her? Why are you asking? Your cat is constantly with us, the mailman has told me he hasn't seen her in a while... ...and you always sign the pension receipts. It would be a pity if something happened to her, after all, a German pension is a German pension... Leave us alone! Say hello to our wife! Hi, I'm Lidija. I live here, so I dropped by to say hello. Here, this is for you. Jesus, you did a great job whit this flat. Man, you can't imagine how morbid was when Ms. Lazarin lived here. Now, it's totally cool! I painted mine in purple, it's much better like that... And your bed, it's great... I got myself a white one. This is cool, but you have to come and see my apartment. What are you doing? I'm studying. Cool! I used to study, but then said to myself, my dear, there's no money in that. Tell me something about yourself. They say I'm great listener. I'll open a private practice... I forgot to mention that, I'll be a shrink. Why don?t you... make some coffee? It's great coffee. May I smoke, I mean, I have to smoke. I'll get you an ashtray. Bloody hell... it's my favourite dress... and now it's destroyed. What are you looking at, my tits? Be! If it wasn't for that sportswoman, everything would be fine. What do you think, does she like you? I don't know. I noticed she was looking at my tits. Fuck, with a man it's easy, you grab him by the cock and he's finished... Please, don?t talk like that. All tight, I just wanted to say that I've never seduced a woman before. You won't regret it if you succeed. This time, young lady, you are not only in my service! Whose then? God's, God's service, young lady. We are helping a sinner find the right path again. Good bye. "In Jagiceva street there was a cruel attack on gipsy male who was found by two workers... of Croatian railroads... They rescued gipsy on time... " And we did our maximum in the right moment for our community, didn't we? There, they take no care at all. Every now and then somebody ends fucked up. "Muhamed is in shock... " I don't know what's going on in this world, we were doing our job and they attacked us like wild animals. ...as if we were garbage. I am a Croat, too. The hell you are. Here, I can show you. This is my certificate. Croatia is my homeland, too. Where are you going? It's Sunday. I can go out if I want. "Zagreb is becoming an unsecure place for living... " Hey... Easy, I won't hurt you. Hanging out the clothes, ha? You know what happened to me yesterday in store? There came an old woman and wanted some milk, and I gave her a package which was leaking, put it on the counter and she said: Sorry, the milk is leaking... and I said: It's not leaking to me, it's leaking to you and charged her for it. She went completely nuts... Today I'm not working and if you want we could go out, I mean... for a drink. How about that? Thank you, but I have an exam. I have to study. I mean, you can invite your friend and I will invite mine. We can go out together, ha? Or, if you want, we can go out alone. Mr. Rukavina, everybody's complaining of a horrible stench coming from your apartment. Leave us alone, please, my wife needs peace. I'll call the police! Where's the family going? To the church, not like this communist here. Well said, we won't put up with your stench! Hi beautiful. Good afternoon. What happened? Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? I wanted to ask her out, but she ran away. Who does she think she is? What does that creep think he is? He thinks he can grope every broad he sees? Leave it, everything is fie. you talk to him! Why didn't you tell him to go to hell? Hi! My little neighbor... I knew you would come to me sooner or later. What's the problem, sweetie, you got knocked up? Oh, if I see him, I'll twist his balls. Doctor... Yes? I need some alcohol and bandages, if you have... Oh that. You know, today I cannot concentrate properly. Our subtenant is pregnant, I saw her entering the doctor's apartment. You see, she fucks around and with me she plays innocent. Here, I've found it. Oh reverend sisters, it's you again. I hope it will be enough. Come in, don?t be afraid... come, come... Thank you. Whenever you need something, just ask. After all, we are neighbours... Everything at half price. Something really stinks here, like on post mortem... They all want to separate us, I know it. But see what I have for you, my rose... I'll perfume you and nobody will say that you stink, my love... I'm sorry. Do you want me to take a photo of you? I don?t like it... Shut up... Come on... I always look terrible on photographs. Come on... look at me! Halo... it's me... yes. Why don't you call Dr. Peric? Who's calling? Yes, but I... all right... yes. OK... Who was it? Lidija. What did she want? She says she has a terrible stomachache ...and she wants me to examine her. She has a stomachache... and wants you to examine her... maybe she wants you to cure her syphilis... Are you jealous? Who should I be jealous of, Lidija maybe? I've never been jealous. Never? Now we'll take a photo of the jealous Mare. Should I be jealous? Come here... I asked you something... don?t... I'm in a hurry. Come in... Sorry to bother you Iva but I'm in a real pain and need you to examine me... Where do you feel pain? Down here.. put your hand, you'll feel something vibrating... I cannot move all morning... Fuck, I have thousands things to do, haven't done anything yet... Why are you doing that? What? I know you are pretending and you are lousy at it, but I don't understand why... Will you tell me? Don?t do it again, OK? This is ours. Keep it. At least you tried to seduce her. No, I earn my money honestly. I haven't done the job, I'm giving back the money. I need the money but business is business... Unless you want some other service... ...for this amount you can stay all night... No, thank you. Somebody attacked our neighbour Lidija... Open the door! Turn on the light! Neighbour, are you OK? I bet somebody paid her to scream. I didn't do anything to him. He just stopped moving. Shame on you. This is the second on this year! Should I ask every customer to show me a certificate that he doesn't suffer form a coronary disease? So buddy, they fucked us properly, ha? Bloody motherfuckers! Hi, Ivica! Is your Dad at home? What's the matter with you? How many time have I told you not to barge in when I'm working? Who gave you that bottle? When... What funeral? Mum, Mum, you're lying. I don?t have to come to the funeral... Mum it's not true, it's not... What happened? Mare? My mother tortured him all his life... like everybody else around... He seemed to have grown numb... As if he ever thought about anything... He was so... normal... such an ordinary man... I don?t know... I mean, that they hired a hooker to separate us... it is the most pathetic story I have ever heard... ...it's so... There's Dalibor. Shall we leave? It's not necessary, he's seen me. Hi Iva, how are you? Well... this is Marija, my roommate. Nice to meet you. Marija. Hi! And? How about you? Well, business as usual, you know. I just have some partners from Kenia, you know how it goes. You? Nothing, university, this and that... Everything cool, ha? Great! That's nice. I'm glad for you. Would you and your friend move to our table? No we were just leaving. OK, I'm just asking... If you need something, give me a call. Bye. Bye. See, the little whore is telling the truth. All names are here all the grieved family, everybody but her. Here is the wife, brothers, but no daughter. Will you stop? You stare at the bloody papers all day. It's not our business. They are our subtenants, her father died in our building and you say it's not our business. So, for you it's normal that you die and Daniel doesn't go to your funeral. I don't care. As far as I'm concerned, nobody has to come... Here the are. Look! And you call it normal? What? She's not in black. Her father died and she in jogging suit. I'm telling you that something's wrong in that family! Leave the girls aloe! You didn't take our exam because of me... Doesn't matter, I wasn't really ready. Good afternoon, may I come in? What do you want? I know this is not right moment, but my husband is at the doctors' so I took the opportunity... I wanted to thank you for not telling anyone... What about? About what happened to Dr. Peric. I love children dearly, I would have never done it, if my husband hadn't fallen ill. And I'm afraid for Dr Peric... My husband might hurt him... And he's so stubborn, he wants a son, not a daughter... and his pals in the bar tease him that he cannot have so... And we had such a wonderful life before war... Thank you for not telling him. You're welcome. Where are you going? To see our subtenants. Why? To express my condolences. I know what's proper! Something must have happened! I knocked for five minutes, but they didn't open. Maybe they want to be alone. And if they killed themselves? I'm telling you something's very wrong in that family. It's wrong in your head... Quickly, give me some sugar and water! What happened? They are licking each other! Who? Our subtenants. What are they licking? One another all over the body! Now I see why their families abandoned them. Lesbians, I saw them fuck! I know man girls who do that. So young and ignoring dicks already! And we're surprised that there are not enough of us Croatians. I have to tell my wife, she's waiting for me! That's why the little whore rejected my Daniel! Let the girls live their lives. Whores! They should be taught a lesson! What is it, a queue? Fuck off... What are you looking at? It I as a woman, stood no chance, you shouldn't even try... Wanna bet? In what? You know well in what, once a week! Deal, but if I win, I get to shop here the whole month for free... Two weeks. A month. OK... Wait, let's talk. I'm in a hurry. So what? Your friend will wait... So, what did we say, when are we going out? I have to study. Wait a second! Why do you always bullshit me about having to study? Why don't you just tell me that your whore won't let you go out? You don't like me, is that it? What's wrong with me? Let go of me! What should I let go? Who's holding you? Suck my dick... How many have you smoked today? We have to leave the apartment. Really? Why, we haven't done anything! What do you think why? When are we moving out? She'd like to kick us out immediately, but has a good heart, so we have a fifteen days notice. And we have to separate beds when we move out. What? If you were a real man, you'd tell them to leave, not I! They don't disturb me. What about AIDS? What has it to do with AIDS? It's all the same, faggots and lesbians. I wonder if you would be thinking the same if you caught it! Enough with your bullshit, you motherfucking whores! Hear that? It's crazy Lasic again. Maybe he killed his wife... Better for her then to support him all her life. Marija... Marija! Yes? IT'S MUCH SWEETER WITH THIS! I'm scared shitless! Daniel... Oh my, I'd like to get out of here! What are you doing? Jura, look, a dick has fallen from the sky! IMPOTENT, PUT IT IN YOUR ASS! What are you doing? Who let you do it? I called him. Your son has no right to enter our apartment at night. The little time we are here, I want us to be at peace. In his own apartment he can do what he wants! Put the old lock back! You just do your job. I will take no orders from an ordinary lesbian! And you, stop working or I'll call the police! Decide what you want me to do people... You're gonna change my locks, ha? What is it? What the fuck are you staring at? What's the problem with you? Hear that? Hear what she's saying? And I wonder why the kid doesn't want my Daniel. Of course she doesn't, when she licks her roommate's cunt! You know what, no normal woman would ever touch your Daniel! You, whore, you won?t talk like that about my son! Yes I will, about our impotent moronic so. I'll take your eyes out, you whore, get out of here! You won't insult my Daniel... Oh, yes, I will insult your impotent idiot, yes I will! Get out! You get out! Go fuck yourselves, you whores! You, put the old lock back! And you, how can you let them insult me like that? Who's insulting you? The lesbians. Shame on you, girls... my wife comes from a good house. Girls... here is the dress of a friend who rents a similar apartment... Just tell him that Blaz sends you and there'll be no problems... Thanks landlord... What kid of landlord am I? You have to leave apartment by tomorrow morning! Bye girls... Everything is OK now... I can't believe... That's me... I suffer until I explode... Do you know that the little whore was telling around that you are an impotent moron? What? The whole building heard her... I can't believe... I have no idea what's going on... Why didn't you call me? Dad was great. He told them to leave immediately. Why the fuck do you always have to interfere? Why can't you leave me alone? Where are you going now? I'm going to hell... Why do you have to control me... Boys, I'm really sorry but the girls have played with the phone again... The girls did that too...? No, I did it myself... I hit myself against the vacuum cleaner... Vacuum cleaner? We really let everyone pull our noses... Probably the switch jumped out... Where are you going? Let it stay here tonight. I can't believe... What is it commies? I showed you, ha? Communist motherfuckers... My angles... Daddy has bought batteries! Let them hear... You failed, ha? We'll see about that. Why are you laughing? Mom's impotent moron... How about a beer, chief? We're closed. Closed? Is it night already? I have my period. I'm not working. What the fuck is it now? Give me a knife. What knife? Give me a knife, do you hear?! What do you need a knife for? You're out of your mind! Sorry to bother you but I cut myself and I thought you might take a look... I went to Dr. Peric but he has a patient. I dropped a crate and cut myself on a bottle! And I wanted to apologize for what I've done... I mean, I acted like an idiot... How could I know that you don't like men? All right... if you don't want... OK... Wait. Show me our hand. If you want... I could talk to my mother to let you stay. It's not necessary. You're still mad at me, aren't you. Why can't we go out? I mean... we'll have a drink or two, as friends... What do you think? You are nuisance. Fuck it, why are you like this? I'm not gonna bite your hand off, I just invited you for a drink... I mean, I hate faggots, I really detest them, but I'm totally OK with lesbians... I think you're cool... I mean, I really like you... What do you say? Will we go out for a drink? No. Now you are mocking me? What was it... mummy's impotent moron... Is that what you called me... ha? What is it? What? Have you seen Daniel? People are waiting for him in shop... He went to pee... You go and serve them... What are you waiting for? Are you all right? Sorry, fuck it... it's not my fault... You shouldn't have teased me... As if I were to blame... What is it? What do you want now? What more do you want? Here, I'm sorry. Fuck it, I'm sorry... You're not going to report me, are you? Please don't... Say something... ...at least look at me! Fuck you, see what I've done? See what happens when you fuck with me! It's not my fault... Not mine! Fuck you lesbian whore! You are all the same, you just make trouble! Just say a word about this, I'll kill you! Where have you been? People are coming and I don't know prices! Mum asked for me, didn't she? Mum? Didn't you go to the toilette? Listen, if you care for me, you'll say I was here all the time... What have you done? Nothing! Just say I was here... My son, you are such an idiot... Where are you going? Come immediately! Yes! You shouldn't tell anyone about this... least of all Marija... ...she would get terribly mad. Promise? You should see the apartment... looking at the woods, no noise... Iv... Jesus, who did this to you? Do you hear me? Where is your son? Fuck you! Get out whore! Get out now! Your friend finally enjoyed as a real woman! He's gone towards wagons... You jerk! Fuck you! Come quickly, that whore is chasing our son! Quick! I will fuck you too... Iv... Let's get out of here... We have to run! My only love... What has that whore done to you! I'll kill her... I'll kill her! Quiet, people... you'll wake up my wife! What happened? People, help me! Bloody whore has killed my son... Dam whore! They are going to kill us. Quiet! Now our boyfriend's gonna get it, you'll see... Whore! I'll kill you! Calm down... Peace! I'll call the police! I don?t need police... I'll kill her myself! He raped her! You're lying! She invited him to your flat! You killed him because you were jealous! Whore! Where do you think you're going?! Leave her! Fuck off! Everybody knows your wife had an abortion, you jerk! What?! Speak! Speak! Tell me! She's lying... ask doctor... Doctor... is it true you motherfucker?! What abortion? I'm catholic, just like you! Fuck off, you phonies! Mrs. Rukavina? Shoot the whore! Shut up! I'm thinking! The guy is beating his wife again... Let's go... Where? Somewhere, anywhere... Have you thought of something, you idiot... The whore has killed my son! Shut up! Marika! You killed my Marika! What will my wife say? The whore killed her! Grab the whore! She'll escape! Mare... Come... Ivica is charged with Marija's murder. Doctor?s kid? All the tenants testified he was the one who pushed her down the stairs, in self defense. I could not testify because I haven't seen anything... I'm sure somebody pushed her... She didn't simply fall, that much I know. Since Ivica is ill, he was quickly released... Everything was fie until my Toma was born... Then she started to come and watch him play in the garden for hours and hours... Mrs. Olga? She thinks my Toma is Daniel's son and she is his grandmother. She used to buy him clothes, candies, toys, stupid things... Once she called me and told me she would like I name the kid Daniel... But in fact... I live in constant fear that my husband will find out... Your husband? I apologize, but after everything you've told me, I didn't expect you have a husband. I married my ex boyfriend. Dalibor? Yes. And Dalibor doesn?t know? No... Do you think you know everything about our wife? You know more about other people then about our own family... Where is he now? On a business trip. He's coming back tomorrow. You'll have to tell him something... I know. I'll let you know as soon as I have some information... Goodbye. Goodbye... What are you doing? I'm bus... Baric, listen... ...nothing... big kiss! Ivica, go home! It's good, good food... Let's have a bite... Come on, granny's treasure... let's eat... Olga... This is not our grandson, Olga... I told you, I don't want to talk about it any more... You killed my son, you will not have my grandson... See how little Daniel has finally come to his daddy's apartment... Bring me some gauze to wipe his face... Do you want your granny to fix this dredger? Give it to me? You don't want it? There's no gauze here... Get lost! You're good for nothing! I have to do everything myself! Are you blind? Here's the gauze!
