[slow-paced music] [chatter] [inaudible] Good. Nobody touches him. Bunch of ass-rangers tried to take him in the shower, sliced an ear off one of them. Got away clean. You're their queen, huh? This your big black 'daddy'? You're "Broole", ain't you? It's French for 'burn', right? [groans] [hard thud] [yelling] It's pronounced "Broo-lay." It means already burned. [officer] Okay, coming through! Get me his file. [rainfall] [speaking Spanish] I'm sorry, Ms. C. What the hell is the matter with you? I'm sorry, man. I thought you were my primo bonito. You do that to a cousin? Are you crazy? Hey, go easy. We're just kidding around. If my old partner were here, you'd be dead by now. [speaking Spanish] I'm just fileting the fish, eh. Ricky. Are you dirty? Si, so long as I've been on the outside, man. -Come on, let me see. -No, okay. I'm dirty. But I got that job, eh. -The delivery job? -Yeah. Gracias for that. But I don't start for a week. That's good, 'cause you know what? You're going to detox tonight. You'll be out just in time to start work. [speaking Spanish] I ain't going to no detox. A knife is a righteous violation. [speaking Spanish] Man, you sure know how to kill my Saturday night. Shut the door. [knocking] I would've sold him but he cries too much. Oh, remind me to give you a [inaudible] when they give you a good citizenship award. Hey, come on, Ms. C. How about giving me 90 days off my parole? In your dreams, Egan. Thanks. Come on. I did you a favor. [baby cries] Okay, alright. [car starts] [Larry] I swear, Ms. C, these are the wrong meds. Can't sleep, can't think. Except I want to kill somebody. But you took the meds back and you told them, right? They won't believe me. You've got to help me. I'm afraid to stop taking them and I'm afraid to take them. You know what? Let's just go down there right now and I will talk to them for you, alright? Can you wait outside for a minute? [Jennifer] I'll be right there, Larry. Oh, don't worry. That's just Wilson. How did Lee's sister get a hold of the baby? Look, they're giving poor Larry Frank the wrong meds, I've got [inaudible] on parole, got 20 cases pending, and you want to know how this baby gets to live with its own family? Can't cover for you if I don't know what you're doing. You're there for me and that's all I need. Lee's sister called. The baby's fine. I better get to Larry. He's about to-- Damn, lost him. [Wilson] You need to watch yourself, Jenny. You put too much of yourself into it. Trust my judgement. I always know what I'm getting into. [serious music] You were quick out there with those skins. Almost seemed like you were down with the brothers. What's up? You got 14 more years in here, am I right? Word has it you were [inaudible] My sources say that it's true. How would you like to get sprung up out of here? [scoffs] If you can move mountains, why don't you slide on out of here? My case is different. Yours is simple. You're offering me a contract? It'll get you out of here with 20 grand. What makes you think you can trust me? Maybe the good people on the outside don't keep their word on deals. But screw a deal made on the inside? You'll keep your word. He's already done his time, he doesn't belong in a prison hospital. You know, I couldn't get him in there even if I wanted to. -Come on, he's a vet. -Take him to county. I did. He doesn't have Medicare. Oh, god. No wonder he's flipping out. I've been trying to tell you. Alright. This is the best I can do. Thanks. Let's hope it's better than the last one. Hm, fresh meds. He's just doing his job, following orders. You got to come here. Come on, I'll take you home. No, I'll walk. Larry, it's three miles. That's good. Maybe I'll be wasted enough to crash. I'll walk with you then. Why? It's three miles. Well, why not? I miss my Tai Chi and... I enjoy your company. [singing] You care. Well, it's business, Larry. I'm accountable for you. Anyway, you do what's right. That's what my daddy taught me. Was he a cop or something? No, he was a colonel, he got killed in Vietnam. He was lucky. He got out lucky. Lucky? Are you crazy? You're okay. You're fine. You wouldn't have been if you daddy had come home. No. Let me tell you how it works. See, in 'Nam, nobody wins there. You die there, or you die here. If you die here, you take everybody with you. You just do what your daddy told you, never mind the commands and don't be part of the chain. Well, but, there has to be some kind of order. Oh, fuck the orders. Yeah, you obey orders, you'd do shit you'd never thought you'd do. Hey, Larry. Slow down. We'll get there, okay? [sirens] [officer] Move it along, ladies. Let's go. [Alfonso] Eight years I run this business. Then she comes on the scene. [Henri] Wait a minute, you talking about hitting a woman? [Alfonso] Her name is Claire Carrol. Because of her we got to close the whole operation down, so I start selling on my own. [Henri] Yeah? Yeah, and he freaks out, but I keep selling. I'm even selling to the whacky-ass militia cats and I pay everybody off just like I always do. But for some reason this time, the feds don't look the other way. I see. Steward crossed you so he could keep her. Right, now I want you to do her and him. You understand, boy? [Henri] No, I don't get it. Look, I'm not talking about you wasting her, I'm talking about you screwing her. See, I know she'll go for you. Look, you get her hot for you, and then you take that hoe any way you want to. But then you tell little Stewart all about it right before you bam! Save her for your mount. The better time you have with her, the more pain for Steward. Get it now? Why me? Why not one of your boys? No, no, see, it's got to be you, 'cause you can get to her. She's a snake. You know how long I've waited for a white boy to get to her? That bitch was the beginning of the end for me. You got some weird ideas about me. [inaudible] You better hop on this fruit train, because you ain't going to get off with this chance again. [serious music continues] [woman on PA] Welcome to the city. Tony Franco. Mr. James asked me to get you set up here in town. Who's this Bobby Ryan? Runs weapons down in Panama. He'll back you up when the time comes. What's all the steroid stuff? That's your way to Stewart. Alfonso was just waiting for Stewart to get his hands dirty again, and he is. He's running steroids all over Asia. This chick, Claire Carrol, what do you know about her? That's the best part, my friend. You're going to get some pussy, too. Here's your ride. I'll be in touch. [ominous music] Henri, how are you? Hey, Larry. How's it going? Hanging on. Whoa! -Excuse me, Ricky! -Sorry. -Sorry! -Move it! Get it out of my face! -[Ricky] Sorry, my fault. -[Jennifer Back up, back up! -[Ricky] My bad! -[pops] What? Hey! What the-- Man, you better pay for those, eh! -Thank you. -[Ricky] Punk! Forget about it. How's the job going? It's okay. Ooh, but check out my van, eh? Something my boss has me taking home. Kind of cool, huh? Yeah, it's cool. You stay clean, Ricky. [speaking Spanish] [opera music] "Forget about it," huh? [knock] Come on. -Mr. Broole. -Brulé. Hi, I'm Jenny Capitanas, your agent. Capitanas, that's kind of an awkward name. So everyone just calls me Ms. C. I figured you didn't come downtown to buy balloons. So you're living at the Metro. There are a lot of parolees there. You get a job? I got some construction experience inside. Mm-hm. Killed a cop. Did eight years... Ah, clean enough to get an early release. He killed the girl I was with. And you retaliated? Yeah, but he was coming at us. Well, it says here that you shot him seven times. Said the girl was his wife. Was it a crime of passion? [sighs] Look, we have to be able to talk about a few things. We're going to be working together for a long time. [breathes deeply] Any questions for me? Ever kill anybody? -Ask me something else. -Okay. Ever been married? No. Okay, and I don't mind telling you no and no. Married and never killed anybody... Now I know all about you. [scoffs] I got your point. So I'm sure you're aware the conditions of your parole. No weapons, no associating with ex-cons. You report to me every two weeks, okay? Meanwhile, get a job, Henri. -Henri. -Good luck. [sleuth music] [beeping] [gate opens] [man on radio] And now, our Opera Buffs contest. For two tickets to the Marriage of Figaro, which composer wrote his last great opera in jail and never lived to hear it played? Hello? Hi, is it too late? I'm the first caller? Wow! Um, yeah, it was Carlo Fiore. Only it wasn't jail, it was a debtor's prison. I won? Oh, my god! [screams] I won! I won! You guys? -Oh... -[phone rings] Jenny Capitanas. [Henri] Yeah, get down here as quick as you can! I'm with Larry Frank! Who is this? It's Brulé! Look, he's asking for you! He said your name! [panting] Hey, you're just in time for his last trip. Relax. Don't fight it, don't fight it. [Jennifer] Just hang in there, Larry. Just breath. [mumbling] [Jennifer] Come on, you can do it. Hang in there. -Hang in! -Relax. [Jennifer] breath! Come on, you can do it. Hang in there. Breath! Breathe, Larry. [whispers] Breath, breath! Breathe, breathe! Breathe... -We're losing him. -Breathe... No pulse. Start compressions. [serious music] No, it's no use. He's gone. I'm sorry. Get that blanket, alright? He's better off. Yeah... You know, I'm glad that you were here with him. That somebody was here with him. [cries] [chatter] What happened here? What here? I came down the hallway to check on Backer, I look and I see this guy working over Larry. I was trying to shake him out of it. You need to be quiet right now, okay? I go in to pull him off and he hits me. It was an accident! My elbow-- You shut up! Look, he called me and 911. Yeah, so what? He's covered himself, you know? He saw the junkie [inaudible] he panics and he's setting you up to back him, that's what he's doing, okay? Take the cuffs off. You should check this dude out, okay? 'Cause he's playing you. I know Larry. He was having problems with his meds. Well, you don't know this guy, do you? You know this guy? You don't know this guy. This guy's trouble. Maybe, but he's my trouble. So take the cuffs off and I'll handle the rest. Fine. [serious music] [chatter] Henri! Fancy meeting you here. Hey. Um... Uh, listen, I just thought you should know Larry's autopsy showed no signs of illegal drugs so you're in the clear. Great. Thanks a lot. -What are you doing here? -What? You don't think I like this music? No, of course not. No, that's not why I'm surprised. It's just unusual for me to see-- Cons at the opera? No, to see anybody from work. I mean I won my tickets on the Opera Buffs. Congratulations. Hey, Henri? You check your attitude. You give people a little room if you want to make it in the real world. People like Wilson? Give him room to screw me? No, I mean you learn to tell the difference between bullshit and the real thing. Like you did with Larry. Enjoy the opera. [traffic] Excuse me, can I see these earrings? [woman] I'll be with you in a minute. -The diamond studs. -[taps] [woman] Excuse me. Miss? Would you mind trying this on? So I can see how they look? I can do that, sir. Thanks, but she looks more like my girlfriend. Of course. -Nice skin. -Thank you. Oh, yeah. These are beautiful. You smell great. -Okay, that's enough. -Let must just--Wow. -I just want to-- -Okay, okay. -Aright, stop! Let go of me! -Sir, please. Are you alright? [door opens and closes] I should be fine. Hey, "Broole"! Brulé. You made contact? Yeah, yeah, it's going to be hot. Yeah? She went for you? Don't worry about the chick, alright? Nah, nah, you're the man. Yeah, right. I'm the man. Well, maybe you've been inside too long. You got that piece? Alfonso's waiting. You got a message for me? If I do, I'll write him a postcard. Your boy is here to see you. -[door closes] -What's up? I'm the one who usually pays the surprise visits. Yeah, I know. Seems like every time I run into you, I blow my fuse. That's alright. You'll mellow out, you just need a little time on the outside. Can I buy you a cup of coffee? Save your money. I accept your apology. Look, I've got something that I would like to ask of you. I've been doing a lot of thinking. And I've decided that... What's on your mind, Henri? Well, like you said, we're going to be working together. Mm-hm. I thought maybe I should tell you about myself. My life story. Your life story? Yeah, you know the best part isn't in my file. [chuckles] Well, now, that is something that I do need to know but I have probably an hour left on this desk so next visit will work out just fine. It's kind of important. Fine, okay. Junction Café, one hour. -Great. -[sighs] So what did he want? Well, if you really want to know, he was about to lodge a complaint against you for the Larry Frank incident. And I supposed you enlightened him that he's the convict and we're the guardian angels? I told him to go ahead. What, you want to get accusatory here? Why are you letting this guy work you? You are so into yourself. He didn't even mention it. You think your miss untouchable? Huh? You think you're in control? You know as well as I do the minute you trust these guys, they're going to screw you. And when this guy does it to you, don't be surprised there's no backup on your side. Great, I'll probably be safer that way. [Henri] I grew up on the street. You know, around a lot of hookers, dancers. They liked me. But I looked out for them. You're probably the first girl I ever had coffee with that wasn't a dancer. Woman. First woman. And I don't believe you. Woman. That's true. Look, I could never really... Let me see... I could never really talk to nice girls, woman. Henri. What is this about? I want you to teach me. Teach you what? I want you to teach me how to be with a nice woman. Educated, classy. I help out with things, you know I do, but with practical things like how to drive. You know, you were right about the other night. I never went to an opera before. Well, is there someone special to you that like opera? You don't understand. I don't want to scare people. I just want to be normal. Okay, well, um... How'd did you like the opera? Strange. [both chuckle] Kind of like a weird dream. All those people singing at the same time, you know, there voices were like so big, it was... Almost like they could fly. [chuckles] When I hear those voices, makes me feel like I can fly. I asked around about you. Yeah? The word is you're for real. Are you? [sighs] Okay, okay. But it's going to go both ways. Alright, there's a parolee program called Advantage. It's five hours of community service per week, it's group therapy, it'll be a plus on your record, and I'll sponsor you, is this too difficult for you? I mean, 'cause I have a lot of other ways I can spend time. I can handle it. Good. And in return, we can start a little tutorial. But it has to have a time limit. -Okay. -Okay. I'll see you later. That's what I love about the outside, never enough time for anything. [relaxing music] Morning. This is called, "Embrace tiger, return to mountain." That's some beautiful shit. It's about harmony. Tai Chi is like a dance. Like you're dancing with patience, and courage, right? Brute strength, weight lifting, not going to help you. You want to get started? [clears throat] [chuckles] We got to loosen you up, your walk, it's so... My walk? Well, you walk like... You know, you walk like that. That's what you look like when you walk. [scoffs] How's a guy going to change his walk? Come on, that's shit. Tai Chi is not shit. The world is not shit, life is not shit. You know what? Let's just loosen up, let's just-- -Just loosen up. -Yeah, loosen up. Loosen up, let it go. Hey, boom-boom. Hey! Um, that's not going to help you, just relax. Right, relax. Let go, you have to let go. Start with the hips. Just loosen the hips. -Loosen the hips. -Yeah, let it go. Loosen the hips. Can you bend your knees a little more? Bend them, that's good. Let them go. Bend, relax, let them go. [yells] [laughs] That's some shit, right? [serious music] [beeping] [Henri] Mind if I sit down? You like to cook, huh? Now and then. I make a mean beignet myself. You ever had one? They're delicious. All you got to do is you take fresh eggs and you whip them real fast. Then you add some sugar. Make it nice and sweet like you. Mix in the flour and the eggs so the dough gets nice and sticky. -And then you heat up the oil. -Excuse me? Now you got the get the oil hot. Hot as you can make it. And then you take the dough and you slap it against the side of the wall. And you just keep slapping it until it gets nice and loose. And then you stick it in the hot oil. And I promise you it is the most-- What's the matter? Where are you going? I'm explaining my recipe. Thanks for the cooking lesson. Yeah, you probably like donuts. Bitch. She didn't even give me a chance. Now, you're talking like an ex-con. You blame everybody but yourself. What about you? [leisurely music] Oh, shit. More homework? Excuse me? Sorry, I mean, uh, how was your day? Tell me all about it. Never mind about my day. I thought maybe I should-- Sorry I asked. Excuse me, isn't there a whole chapter in that book devoted to how men interrupt women? Yeah. [sighs] What's this? I can't accept this. It's way against the rules. Come on. You're spending all this time doing all these things for me. Well, you've been doing the community service, right? Look. You don't know owe me nothing, alright? Anything, I don't own you anything. "Anything." [sighs] That's nice. Thank you. Your welcome. So tell me something. Am I making progress? Yeah, yeah. -Yeah? -Yeah. I mean, verbally, you're doing very well and... -But? -You, um... -Uh... -Come on. The sideburns. It's, I... You don't like my sideburns? It's Vegas. -I love Vegas. -[chuckles] I'm sorry. Was that too much? But you know what? I know a really good hairstylist. [serious music] [man laughs] [inaudible] Anyone here who'd think they might like to disagree? [man] Forget it. Jablonski's a foot taller. He'd crush The Kid. I'll take that bet. Now, there's a man with balls. Have a seat. Henry Burns. John Stewart. It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Burns. [announcer on TV] The third and final round is up. [inaudible] Jablonski wants to take this kid to his back. He's got The Kid down! Jablonski's got the first two points. The Kid is scooting away from him, but Jablonski's put all his weight on him. The Kid fights back with a neck move. [inaudible] He pushes the big Russian down. The Kid wasn't over. He's put Jablonski right on his back. Five points! Strong kid. -I think he had an edge. -Oh, he did, didn't he? Yeah. So tell me, this wrestling thing your game or you just happened to get lucky? I just know the body. I knew who was going to last. Really? And how'd you go and figure on that? Steroids. There was no sweat on The Kid. Have I seen you around the club before, Henry? I come and go. My business takes me everywhere. What kind of business might that be? Import, export, French-Canadian. But we're in New Orleans. You? Investments. Everything from real estate to golf balls. Which reminds me, my fiancé, she ought to be done with the game by now. You know, we're going to lunch, Henry. How'd you like to join us? Sweetheart, I want you to meet Henry Burns. Henry, this is Claire Carrol. Hi. I'm sorry, do we know each other? I don't think so. Henry will be joining us for lunch so there'll be plenty of time to get it in there. Okay. I was thinking of hitting some balls today, but, watching you play makes me think I'm out of my league. [opera music] Is that the reason you like opera? I don't know who the hell she is. Well, I brought you something to get started with a nice woman. Just when you offer it, don't say, "Here's my fucking card!" See, what you do, is when someone like that, that lady catches your eye, you send over a drink with the card and then you're halfway there. Wait, a minute. These little cards do all that? Little magic cards? Well, that and a great haircut. [breathes deeply] [opera music] Oh, shit! [barks] -What's the matter? -It's Wilson. What can they do to you for going to the opera? Socializing with a parolee? Are you crazy? Internal affairs would be after me before you could say Don Giovanni. Is that what we're doing? Socializing? No. He's gone. No! I would never do anything to hurt you. A: I would lose my job, B: it's not right. Okay? It's just not right. Stop. Stop! This won't happen. -Alright? This will not happen. -It already has. Can I call you? -Will you give me your number? -No! [starts engine] You don't feel anything for me? Tell me I was right! The whole thing is shit! Six, three, nine, ten, ten. Give me some time. [tires screech] [dialing] [phone rings] [Jennifer] Hi, sorry I missed your call. Please leave a message. [message beeps] [Henri] I just wanted to make sure you didn't wipe out a tree or something, the way you were flying. I'm at this payphone. I have nothing in this world... Except this line to you. And if that's what being with a woman in the right way is all about... I know I'll never have another chance to be alive like this again... Anyway, the opera was great. I'll see you tomorrow, for Tai Chi. Bye. [hangs up] [beeps] Looks great. -You got it. -Thanks to you. This has to be our last lesson. But I'm just getting good. There are a lot of great martial art schools all over town. Well... If it's got to be, it's got to be. Okay, so, you want to start where we left off? -Ready? -Yeah. Okay, step back. Prepare to strike tiger. As if... shutting a door... Good. Snake moves down... -[both] Snake moves in. -Hey! If you care about me, you won't. Don't you see? What we have is protected. It's like there's a halo or something around us. -Nobody can see us. -It's more like a target. -Alright? -No, this is good. Oh, god. Not here, okay? Not here. [slow-paced music] [moaning] This is crazy, but so great. -Hey! -Come on! Hey, wait a minute! Wait. Wait, no! No! Get off of me! [Henri] Come on, relax! Wait a minute! Get off of me! [screams] Get off of me! [dramatic music] [glass shatters] [loud banging] [cries] [music softens] [Henri] Sorry for the lamp. The lamp is replaceable. Maybe. I mean, now I'm forever vulnerable. You think I would use this? Never. Believe me. Never. [chatter] -Henry. -John. So, I understand we have mutual friends. Yeah, yeah, and mutual business. I like the way you cut out of weapons at just the right time. Bobby Ryan told me you had the same instincts. So tell me, Henry... Who did your flying for you? Paul Gionitti. I was in the plane when he went down. Really? I'm that plane. You're kidding? [scoffs] You remember the way he'd skim over the bush, land in a field, middle of the night, pitch black, radar, sonar, meant nothing to him. How the hell did you spot that crash, Henry? Paul caught a bullet on take-off. He climbed high enough to let me bail out, I jumped. So Bobby Ryan tells me you got some steroids to move. Yeah, I invest in this hot new brand. I've been looking for distribution. Can I check out your product? Sure. You'll have to tell me who your end users are. -[scoffs] -Sweetheart. [Claire] Wow, my timing is perfect. Two handsome men for drinks. And one gorgeous woman. Honey, you remember Henry, don't you? We were just reminiscing telling our war stories, weren't we, Henry? Hm. You know, I was just thinking we should all get together and fly down to San Miguel in my TriStar. [phone rings] Excuse me. Yeah? Yeah. I'll be right there. Sorry, sweetheart. Maybe you can stay here and amuse Henry until I get back. John tells me you do some fascinating travel. Sometimes. Now, what you do, helping people. Charity, that's doing something. Well, I try to contribute to various causes. Saving rare birds, rehabilitating people who have made mistakes. What I give is exhausting but I have to find... I way to forgive myself for having so much when others... It's ironic, isn't it? In a world full of people hurting people the one that's hardest to forgive is yourself. [traffic] Sorry. Your late. I stopped to get you these. I've created a monster. Look, I was, um... I was thinking about this morning, and, uh... I-I was thinking that... I've got to transfer you to another agent. Why? Then there'll be someone else checking up on us. Us? What us? There is no us. That was one time, okay? And when they talk about me, 'cause you know they're going to talk about me, I want them to say at least she had a shred of professionalism left. That she cut him loose when she slept with him. Okay? We just have to be very careful. These are for you. I'll call you. You make contact? Yeah. It's time for Alfonso to call Bobby Ryan. Make sure he gets my name right. Burns. Henry Burns. What about the chick? I'll tell you what, I'll take pictures when it happens. You know, Alfonso can get off behind them. I mean the one these were for. That's my business. Just tell Alfonso to make the call. And get your ass off my car. [suspicious music] [engine starts] [John] This is it, Henry. Breakfast of champions. Stronger, smaller, faster and most effective steroids ever made. Yeah, but some kids have had heart attacks on this stuff though, right? I guarantee there are a million kids out there that could care less. Ten thousand cases, one million dollars, Henry. Can you handle it? This is the last of the hog team batch, my friend. Okay, John. I'll put my buyers together. You got a deal. You know, I knew when you made that bet... Well, let's just say I've been waiting for a guy like you to come along, Henry. My old partner, he had no style. You and I, we can go a long way together. So tell me... Any boyfriends? Well, the last one got tired of call outs at three a.m. and I got paperwork on the weekends. You know, I won't call twenty-four-seven. Yeah, he probably wanted you all to himself. I'm not surprised. Hey! What are you doing? -It's a spider. -Yeah? So you see a spider, you kill it, right? It's not going to hurt you. Why do you want to kill it? I mean, don't you get the feeling when you kill something, I mean, I live being. I mean, anything, even a spider. God, I hate that feeling. It's, like, empty and hard and dark, you know what I mean? That very moment that life goes out. -[laughs] -Are you laughing at me? Well, it's just, you know-- Yeah, I'm a tough little girl, right? Oh, oh! -I got you so bad right then! -She's tough! [screams] [laughs] [soft music] Time to go away. It's probably not a good idea for you to be here in the morning. No, I mean us. Take off with me. That's a little unrealistic, don't you think? No, it's not. Your job's on the line every time we meet. I get sent back if some shit like Wilson finds out about us. He's out to get you too, you know. -You're serious? -Yeah. We could leave the country. I got some money saved up. You jump parole with a murder rap behind you, you would be hunted forever and I would be your accomplice. Is that the kind of life you're fantasizing for us? No. No. In six months, I can transfer you downstate. Forget it. I just went out there, you know? You took me way out there. And I didn't want to come back. [music continues] [Tony] Lover boy. Alfonso's getting impatient. When's it going to happen? Next week. Read about it in the papers, and have the rest of my money ready. You're screwing the wrong bitch. After the hit, she puts it all together right back to Alfonso. How are you going to cover your trail from screwing your own PA? I'm finished with her. I'm into my next move. [moans] [knocking] Boss. It's Saturday. What's the matter with you? Um, I think I have that flu. I have that flu thing. We got a softball game in 10 minutes, remember? I need you on third base. I'll-I'll-I'll infect everybody. Oh, you never get sick. Take a vitamin C, it's only 10 minutes away. No, I don't want anybody to get too close. You know, I mean, it's really... Oh, well, you better go back to bed then. -Yeah. -[clears throat] -You need anything? -No. Good luck. See you. Oh, my god! Where are you going? How are we going to keep this act up for three years? We'll blow it. Well, like you said, we've just got to be careful. Come on, what is it? What's getting to you? Well, don't bale on me. [door opens and closes] [chatter] You ready to mingle with the straight world? Are they ready for me? I'm really proud of you. Here I go. I'll be nearby. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, can't you relax? -You having a good time? -It's good. Brulé turned out alright, didn't he? Yeah, so far. So are you with the program? -Yeah. -I haven't seen you around. Well, I started it last June-- Excuse me. Would you excuse me for a minute? Why are you ignoring me? What, you think because you got me here you own me? Cut the shit! That's not very nice language for such a nice girl. Sorry, 'woman'. Is this all because I won't run away with you? You really think you're the only chick in my life? I can bring you down anytime I want. [serious music] [Wilson] Listen, I think we have a problem with Capitanas and over familiarization. Come on, Wilson. What kind of crap is that? His name is Brulé and I heard them arguing yesterday at the Advantage program luncheon. Huh, so? Sounded like she was jealous about something, it sounded like he was threatening her. You know how closely Jenny works with these guys. She gets great results. I saw them together at the opera, too. -The opera? -Yeah. You go to the opera? No, I don't-- I was walking my dog. Listen. This guy is sideways, okay? I had a run-in with him down in Metro he decked me and she backed him then. Now, do I have to lodge a complaint? I'll talk to her. I'm talking about illegal sexual relations with a parolee. [ominous music] Oh! Jesus Christ! Ricky? What, you think if you scare me enough times I'll have a heart attack? Is that it? -Sorry. -[sighs] You know, you don't look so good, Ms. C. You know, my mom's got some really good [inaudible] for that kind of thing. It's just a cold. Check out those guys in the caddie. [Ricky] That's Tony Franco. What does he do? I don't know who the other guy is. But he does whatever he wants to. -Bad news. -[Jennifer sighs] You know, you should take some drugs or something. Make you feel better! Anyway, later, Ms. C. [sleuth music] [tires screech] Didn't the desk clerk tell you I was here? I came up the side. I guess I should expect this, but I don't like it. I'm sure you don't like it. What are you doing with Tony Franco? I'm your PA, remember? How can I forget? You and me, that was just a setup, right? I mean, that was all just a lie? You wanted to play St. Jenny, so I let you. And the sex was just... It was good, wasn't it? You got to dress up your doll and screw it, too. Why didn't you do that before? Could've been even better. I am watching you. [phone rings] Close the door. You look terrible. What's going on, Jenny? Nothing. I'm just, I'm just feeling the stress. Wilson tells me your parolee Brulé is crossing the line with you. Come on! How the hell did he come up with that? Well, he even saw you. -A date, maybe. -A date? Well, that's ridiculous. I mean, we just, uh, I bumped into him and then we started talking. Interesting fellow. Fresh out of the joint, goes to the opera alone. [scoffs] That's not a parole violation, you know. That's just Wilson looking for a reason to screw me. Well, don't give him one, Jen. Of course not. Don't even come close to that scenario. I won't. [slow-paced music] [Jennifer] Rocky Springs Prison. Hm. [typing] And Alfonso James, too. Same place. But commissioner, he was only recently released from Rocky Springs. I understand. Well... Well, if you remember anything at all, please call me. Alright, thank you. [chatter] I know you wanted to do that since we met. I don't want to do it. -I have to do it. -[chuckles] That's right, no choice. No choice is better that way. Oh, John and his friends are so strange. Tell me... You one of John's boys doing good work? Do you really love John? John chooses those every week. What would he do if he found us here? He'd kill you. Oh, this is how you like it, huh? Feel me? [slow-paced music] [knocking] -Who's that? -[Tony] Let's go. Your girlfriend is springing you, hotshot. -What are you talking about? -She called the commissioner. Alright, look. I'll take care of it. Don't mess up my setup now, I'm almost there. Listen, lover boy. You're not calling the shots anymore. Alfonso says you whack her, too, first. Whack my PA? He's not paying me enough for the death penalty. Death penalty? You do it, and don't leave no connections for nobody. "Anybody!" [door slams] [Ricky] He's working for Tony Franco. He's made some big cake already. Who's behind it? -It's Alfonso James, isn't it? -Right. Thanks, Ricky. Are you going to bring him in? I mean, you better move pronto 'cause this Tony guy is really pushing on him. Are you going to have backup? Sure, of course. [phone rings] Hello? [Jennifer] The sooner we get this over with the better. I'll reassign you and I'll make sure you don't get Wilson. [Henri] Good. No hard feelings? [Jennifer] No hard feelings. In fact, you know, I'm pouring some wine right now, why don't you come over for one last drink? You can sign your transfer papers and... [Henri] Doesn't sound like a good idea. [Jennifer] Come on, it's over. We can be civilized, can't we? [engine starts] [knock] You came. I talked to Russell about your transfer. He said there's no problem. -Wine? -Sure. [pouring] To civilization. Wherever the hell that is. So, you got those transfer papers? Relax, they're right here. Wait a second. [suspicious music] Paranoia back in full swing? What are you doing for Alfonso James? Who? Are you that sleek? That you could be with me the way we were together and it's just a lie? I mean, maybe it's just my ego, you know? Maybe I just-- I just can't admit that I made a mistake. What if you just bust me and get it over with? I mean, if I send you back, and Alfonso gets you. If I let you go and you break the law, then we'll get you, so obviously, you're not moving. You're just going to sit there and watch me forever? I have been trained very patient... [groans] I miss you. You're always good at the bull. You're the only one in my life whoever gave a shit. Wasn't shit that I gave you, remember? Can I have a drink of water? [water running] I remember every inch of you. Tell me you won't do this job. How you smell... Tell me what the job for Alfonso is. I can get you out of this. It's not too late. Believe me, it was too late when we started. [hard thud] [groans] [serious music] [sighs] -[Ricky] Hello? -Ricky? Yeah, it's me. It's time to move on Mr. Brulé. [sleuth music] -And Ricky? -Yeah? Keep your distance. [phone rings] [Jennifer] Hello? [Ricky] He went into a building on 30 McCullum. [Jennifer] Park the van on the side of the street and stay in it. I'll find you. Which building is it? It's this one. You see that door right there? That's how this Henry dude got in. Why are you doing this solo? I mean there's a lot of badass vatos in there. I made a big mistake, Ricky. I got to fix it myself. Stewart! I wouldn't. Drop it. Drop the gun! Slide it to me. Get down on the floor. Down on the floor! You're wasting your talents, Henry. Claire doesn't think it's wasted. [chuckles] Neither does Alfonso James. Who the hell are you, Henry Burns? Name's Brulé. Henri Brulé. [Jennifer] I want you to bring my car around to the back of the building, and then I want you to go home. Thanks, Ricky. Go home? [speaking Spanish] Gun on the floor, Stewart. No, you'll have to take mine yourself. Go ahead, take it. [gunshot] Put your gun down. Let's go! Put your hands where I can see them. Move! Now I have to kill three. You haven't got the balls, Henry. You're just a scared con. [gunshots] Everybody freeze! -Jenny! -[groans] Kill them! Kill them! -Come on! -I told you to go home! [tires screech] [starts engine] You two on the same side? I hope so. [Ricky] Ms. C, what's happening? Ricky, this is Henri. Henri, this is Ricky. Sorry, Ricky. I'll let you off in a minute. I'll give you cab money to get to your van, okay? [Ricky] What? [speaking Spanish] Where are we going, eh? We need a thinking place. Yeah, okay, Ms. C. How about my place? First, I've got to get rid of our friends. [siren] [inaudible] She's a cop! [Freddy] That punk set us up! [Stewart] No, Freddy] He's got something going with her and whatever it is, they're not going to want any cops involved. But we're going to go down every street in this godforsaken slum. [Spanish music] Okay, Ms. C. Here's your thinking place. You keep on an eye on the street for me? [hard hit] [grunts] [footsteps] Don't touch that! Don't even move! [slams door] You really think we're going to be that simple, Henry? Huh? That you can have my sweet, sweet Claire and get away with it? [loud punch] You really think you can cost me a million dollars, and my reputation, much less, my wife for a pathetic punk like Alfonso James? -[hard kick] -No! [groans] Tell me, Henry. Who's your friend? Is she law or just another one of your fancy games? I'm going to show you something. [cocks gun] I'm going to show you how I operate. How I look after my own business. [music intensify] Kill her! [gasps] [gunshots] He's dead. Thank you. It's okay, mija. You going to call backup? Hey, no rush. -Anytime. -Yeah, go ahead. I'll just wait outside. Is there anybody heading south tonight? Why didn't you just arrest me back there? 'Cause I thought I could save you. What about us? There is no us. There was an us. Now, you got to get out of the country. -I didn't mean to-- -I know. I know. You were protecting me. I didn't mean to fall for you. Well, welcome to the human race. [soft music] Why do people fall in love? Love, huh? No shit. Yeah, Ricky will get you a ride, you just got to get out of here. I'm not running. They'll go after you one way or another. I can't let you take the rap for me. I'm okay! They won't put me away. [car horn] [officer] Copy that. Let's go. [officer] Out of the way, please. Thank you. [Russell] Damn it, Jenny. Are you okay? Yeah. Who were these guys? A drug dealer, a gun runner, his bodyguard. Where's your parolee? Look, I told you everything that I know. He saved my life. I got knocked out in the madness, and when I came to, he was gone. He tried to get out of the action and they went after them. Well, you haven't given up after all. Oh. Come on, let's go. [Spanish music] [birds singing] [Henri] Embrace the tiger. Return to the mountain. Henri? What the hell are you doing here? I decided to stop running. Only way to get past it is to pay up. Only way to see you again. Well, they gave you a break. A break? Well, you led me to Stewart and you saved my life so they're going to give you a year for the gun and breaking parole. -A year? -Mm-hm. That's great! Thanks. Sure. Hm, well... Do we have to do it right now? Can we spend a little time? [chuckles] The sooner you're in, the sooner you're out. That's what I love about the outside. Never enough time for anything. [ending music]
