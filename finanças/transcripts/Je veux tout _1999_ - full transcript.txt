Hello, Eva, it's me. It's 11 p.m. I'm at the restaurant as planned. Well, it was planned at 10 p.m. Well... I'm waiting for you. If you have a problem, call 06 07... Well, you know. Eva? Are you here? You're not here? I'm at home. I'm not going anywhere. It's 2 a.m. anyway... Okay, you're not here. PILOT PROJECT FOR A EUROPEAN HOSPITAL IN STRASBOURG Eva, are you here? Eva? It's 15 days since we were supposed to meet up and eight days with no news from you. You stood me up last night. Should I conclude that you're not-- Absolutely! A AS IN ADORE B AS IN BLISS - Eva, come have a look, sweetie pie. - You're awake? I have to go. It's so great to be your sister! Come have a look. - Look, sweetie pie. - What? "A as in Adore, B as in Bliss--" - Thanks, it's my concept. - And here? - Who do you see? - You. Just what I needed to finish my CV. - I have another one. - I'm taking your car. Bring it back by 2:00. - Yes! - You'll die with your contests! With this, I'll move out and buy a car. I'm not asking you to leave. - If only it was for a guy-- - I have no time for a guy. - Ouch! - What's wrong? - It hurts! - A boob job? - Don't touch! - Is it for a guy? It's not a guy, it's a prince. Princes can turn into toads, you know. This one is for me. Bye! I don't care, I have others. BEAUTY INSTITUTE - I'm late. - I know. Bye. Goodbye. Hello. I don't have keys! Shit! I can't believe it! Where are the fucking keys? What a stress! He had the keys! Are you going down? No, I'm not going now. It's screwed. I'm late everywhere! Well, I'm going. What a stress! - - - Why am I here? - It's here! - Where, here? - Yes, on the left. What's this mess? Move along! - I'll walk. - Okay, I'm going to pull back. - Goodbye. - Come on, quick! I can't believe it! If he cries, give him his pacifier. I'll be five minutes. Thank you! - Move along! - I can't believe it! Move along! What a stupid life! That's it, I'm finished! You see, we're not utopians. Three nights and it's here! It's huge, Mr. Ronchant. It's suicide. The European pilot hospital is suicide? I didn't hire you for that. - We'll be ridiculed, you and I. - You must be kidding! We have a meeting, and you get cold feet? It's too big for my office. We're small. Okay, you're small. Come on, Pascale, let's go. He's a joke. Pascale agrees with me. You're going beyond the contract we signed. We just signed for the nursery school. The nursery, the retirement home, it's okay. But with the hospital, we're bound to fail. Nursery, kitchen, loo, nappies, it's not my thing. It never will be. So goodbye, kids. Happy nursery. Listen. Aquatic inspiration. It's paradise, isn't it? Yes, and I'd like a bite of the apple. Right. I'm talking about the retirement home. I haven't slept for three nights, I'm gray, I'm green. I would still marry you. To look like a big meringue in a white dress? Forget it. I'm not a princess. Come! - What is it? - The European hospital. - You're in the jury, aren't you? - I see. You didn't think I called to do it again? - Of course not. - Right... I don't want string-pulling. Just have a look at it. This is what I wanted at the hospital. The light attracting life. The restaurant opens to the city. Outside is inside. The city's here, within hand's reach. Look. I'll do something huge. Too green. Coffee, please. I'm not your student anymore. Look! University students eat here because it's nicer than the caf'. Nobody finds a retirement home green. Your cheap coffee isn't green. It's commercial. That's it. It's not green. It's friendly, human. That's it. Do you have a car? Want a ride? No, it's okay. Yes, take me home. Invite me for a drink, to have a chat. No, I'm tired. Bye. Eva, come here. I'll put your file on the pile. But I'm just one voice out of 15. Great! Thanks. I'm off. I'm about to collapse. Bye. Give me the key. Where did you park it? In Créteil, in front of the retirement home. How nice! Thanks a lot! You're pissing me off. I feel you're not well. You want to talk? - No, I'm fine. - You're tense. You should just bang a guy. It would do you good. The first one ringing at the door, right? I just wanted to-- S AS IN SOFTNESS F AS IN FOAM Marc, piss off! Do I know you? No. I'm sorry. It doesn't matter. It's just a painting. No problem. It's my sister, your neighbor. She asked me to do a painting for her. Like the Garden of Eden, but more aquatic. May I come in? - To leave it with you. - Sure. It seems a bit dumb, I know. It's like her. That's what she wanted. She's out. I can't leave it on the landing. Although now... I think it's ruined. That was Adam. And that was Eve. - You're not well? - I'm fine. - When they fall in love. - It's tiredness. Miss! Shit! Miss! Can you hear me? Hello? Miss! What did I do? You'll be all right! It's really bad. Can we switch off the baby monitor? No! You don't want him to sleep with us. We don't care! Three years living with this humming! We don't care! You don't care! You don't care. Okay, I don't care. - Do you love me? - I love you. - Do you love me? - Of course. - No, say "I love you." - I love you. I'm crazy about you! Hello! Daddy, Mommy! I love you! Daddy, Mommy! Daddy's doing the "flog." Hey, baby. - The "flog." - Daddy does the frog. Daddy like to imitate animals. Can you let us sleep? - Go to bed. - Mommy's right. Daddy and Mommy need it. Go to bed. Yeah. - He's going! - Yeah. He listens! I can't believe it! We talk. He's a big boy. He's nearly three. He's not going to play gooseberry. - He could fall in the stairs! - Don't worry, we'd hear him. The next feed is in 15 minutes. Fifteen minutes? For once, we don't have to hurry. Baby, you're hurting Mommy. Oh my little chubby! You're so yummy! There you go. It's so nice in here. I love you. I love you so much! Ouch! Let go of my hair, Darius! Let go of my braid, darling. Let go! Mommy loves you too. Let go of my braid! My neck hurts. Mommy breastfeeds. It hurts her neck, do you understand? Do you? No, don't cry, my darling. Mommy is happy to breastfeed. Mommy is very happy to breastfeed. - Are you okay, my love? - There you go. Yes. - Can you sign the plans? - I haven't finished them. - I did them. - You did them? Yes. I put the kitchen on the roof. - Can you sign? - Wait. You won't be allowed to build on the roof. Put it in the middle, Japanese style. I won't take risks for your crap arrangements. I'm not talking about the loo! The kitchen of the fanciest restaurant in Paris. - If there's a problem, I'm going to jail. - Come on! It's for us. I'm signing tonight with the client. You sold them the idea without the authorization. Wait, are you snubbing me? Are you mad or what? Darius! Shit! My love... What's wrong with you today? Don't you notice anything? - What? - Nothing. - Did you go to the hairdresser? - I wish I could. - There's something. - Yes. You're different. I don't know... The neck brace, stupid! The neck brace! Oh, shit! Oh shit! Sorry! What happened? It's the breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is screwing up my neck! Damn! Quit breastfeeding right now. Don't hurt yourself like that! - But my smell, the milk, the contact-- - Careful with your neck. At least. Do you love me? Of course, I love you. Sorry. Let's go! Hurry up! We're late! Come on, quick, quick! Hello, children! They look so good! Auntie Juliette is proud she made you come here. He's pulling my hair! Sorry, but I have to rush. Sort it out with your brother. You're a big girl. Mommy, she pulled out my eye! Bitch! I'm going to screw her! Don't talk to your sister like that! The language they use! They don't even know what it means. I know! It means-- It's okay, don't tell me. At the third kid, you'll be cool. Two minutes! Come on, out! You see, Darius, Mommy's job before was to build things like that. Houses, buildings. And now, Mommy does things like this. "Crappers"! You don't say "crapper." You say "loo," or "toilet." - Crappers! - No! You can't say that. - You say "I'm going to the loo." - No, "crappers"! Look what Mommy did. A roof isn't always in a hat shape. You can do it like this. Look. - It's good, isn't it? - No. Wait. - Yes? - Hello, sweetie pie? I'm coming! - Not tonight. - - - Too late, I'm two blocks away. Prepare the booze! Bye! Laurent! See you tomorrow. - Laurent! - I think I heard a taxi. Are you crazy? I told you not to come here! I didn't come to see you. Kiss me. It's been three days! - Give me a kiss. - No, people will see us. Just a little kiss. There you go. Stop! - I'm off to Tahiti tomorrow. Come! - To Tahiti? No, at the Méridien Hotel. I have one hour. All right. Anything you want, but kiss me. Oh, honey bunny! I heard the taxi! It's Daddy! You're crazy! Oh man! My ass is all wet! - It's the sprinkler. - I doesn't show. I have to go. Wait till I'm in before leaving. - No lipstick on me? - You're cute when you're scared. Do you love me? What? Yeah. At the Méridien, okay? You're crazy! Yeah! Here's Daddy! Daddy pilot is here! Come on, kids! Darling, you got me scared! - "And the Tickle- - Queen never had laughed so hard." There you go. Sleep now. It's great, no? Twelve different sounds. And this is for the baby. - If he doesn't sleep, you're dead. - The door was open-- It was open so that you don't ring the bell! You have simple pleasures. I just had a meeting with my bankers. They have ruined me. I'm knackered, oppressed, stressed out. I'm dead! It smells so good! You can't stay. I must be alone with Philippe. - We have to work. - I wasn't planning to stay. Here! Our fourth salon. - Well, your fourth salon. - It's true. I earn the money, but it's your work. - Nobody can deny that. - Okay, let me see. Sorry, he'll wake up his brother. I'll be right back. - Your cigarette! - What? The baby! Oh yeah, the cigarette! What's wrong with my baby? Your little nose is blocked? Come with Mommy. You're sleeping, my-- Everything okay? - Oh! - My love. How love can get you trapped! No, what trap? There's no trap at all. His dad and I are great. I work with Philippe, and I love it. I always wanted that complicity at work. Don't worry, I'm fine. You may be right. "Trap" isn't the right word. It's "sacrifice." What are you talking about? What sacrifice? I have a big house with a garden for 4,000 francs a month. - You call that sacrifice? - I'm not attacking you, sweetie. On the contrary. You succeeded, Eva. Well done. You're the smartest one. You may seem domesticated, like your buddy next door, but you have it all. You're chilled, you don't work, no stress, no traffic jams, fuck all. You don't get anything about my life. Wait. Let me show you. I come back at night, I'm exhausted, and you're in great shape. I envy you. Prince Charming won't come, I know. I just want to be like everybody else, with a kid and a working husband. I'm 35. At 38, I have to give birth. Here, get used to the baby. The husband, you sort it out! He's all red, my angel. What I have, I wanted it and built it. I'm not Juliette. I won't spend my life here. Don't compare me to her. She lives in a detached house. Here, it's an old farm. And she's my sister-in-law. Okay, let's close this conversation. You're not trapped. Auntie Juliette is a bumpkin, and Mommy's a little farmer. - What are you? - I'm in love. I won't let go until he plants his little seed. Look how well I'm doing. I want one, I want two, I want three. - What's this? - Wait. Don't move, my love. Wait. Philippe will help me. Here. Hello! I'll be right here to take over. - See how sturdy it is? - Yes. It holds. You'll see. In Japan, they have built a whole library in cardboard. We've been at it for ten minutes, that's enough. Shh. Listen. The wind on a wheat field. Isn't it beautiful? - It's Darius sucking his blanket. - I see. I sold all my ideas about the restaurant. My chairs, my tables, my ashtrays, my paintings and your plans, your concept. It's great. I'm hungry. Would you like some chicken? I can win the Young Creators contest. There's been rumors... are you listening? Listen to me, I'm not finished. They bought a hotel in Deauville. They're only keeping the facade. Architecture and design have to be done. It's huge. They didn't mention it to me, but if I propose a project, maybe... I'll do the plans? No, I have to find a real architect's office. Official, a real structure. It's serious. This time, it's huge. Is your neck better? Already? Philippe! Stay quiet. Don't move, okay? Philippe! I'll go get your little brother. Don't move. Philippe! Philippe? Philippe! There! Got you! - Philippe! - What? - You're not ready! Hurry! - Coming! Get Darius dressed. I'll deal with the baby. - I can't answer. It must be your sister! - Me neither! I'm coming, sweetheart! - Maybe it's your sister. - Hello. Am I disturbing you? You lost! What do you want? You didn't forget? Tabata, 5:30. I'm in a rush. I-- What now? - Isn't this Eva Gautier's house? - What is it? I'm a friend of Eva's. Marc Birnbaum. Marc? Marc, is it you? - Where did you put your shoe? - It's broken. It's crazy! Marc, are you okay? Yes, of course. And you? A guy answered-- Sorry. I'm in a bit of a hurry. Can I call you back? Last time you said that was five years ago. I'm not calling to hit on you. The European hospital project is back on. What are you nappy... saying? It's the administration. The European Commission voted for the budget. Your project was chosen. It's crazy! It's crazy. It's crazy! My project, mine? Me! No! It's a miracle! You can call it a miracle. Hello? - Yes... - I can't find the shoe! - Under the sofa! - Are you okay? - Are you working? - - - Yes, I'm very well. My life is crazy, but I'm fine. Stop everything you're doing. I'm going to die. You'll die later. First, step on it. - - - Are you listening? - Yes. Calm down. You're still as mad. - The shoe. - Okay. Yes, but it's great! Calm down. Meet me right now at the office, 8 Lobau Street. Ask for the architecture office. Okay. Well see you... later... see you very soon. See you later. PARIS COUNCIL ARCHITECTURE DEPARTMENT Philippe! - Yes, ready! - I got it! No! - Do you hear me? - Yes! - I can't hear you! - Stop shouting. I hear you very well. - - - What? - Stop yelling! I can hear you! There's the baby monitor. Oh yes, silly me. The hospital! My project went through! After five years! You hid your shoe. I was chosen! Do you realize, Philippe? Mind your head. - Did you hear me? - You'd have to be deaf. - I'm going to die! - What will we do if you die? My love, I love you so much. You're late, but I don't care. I feel great. Life is beautiful. It's going to be huge. - For both of us. - I know, I'm nervous. For me? You're so cute. I haven't seen you like that in ages. You're so beautiful! - I have to go. - Go! Your Mommy isn't like the others. Some have baby blues, she has baby rock. - Hello. - Hello. Hello, Meryl. Here. Do a photocopy of the plans. My son spilled chocolate on them. - And fax them to the client. - No need, they're in Paris this afternoon. "Dear Philippe..." It's not "Dear sir." Very polite, this fax. I can smell a contract, Meryl. The hotel? We'll have fun. I'll have fun. If it happens, Meryl, it's like an accolade. We have to contact an architect's office. We'll look for an architect? So what? It's not the Apocalypse. It's none of my business, but... But what? The architect is Eva. Okay! We talked about it last night. She's been out of the loop for four years. I need to work with a guy who's on top of things. She just gave birth. She's exhausted. You're still very beautiful. Brussels wants new ideas around very sick persons. A huge humanistic movement. That's why they chose you. And you know the site. It's still Strasbourg. And you're very charming. - I can't believe it. - Wait. There are five candidates. A Spaniard, a German, a Belgian and two French, Duval and you. - You haven't won yet. - Duval? He has the Board on his side. I don't stand a chance. Your retirement home multiplied. It became a model. Your ex-associates built them everywhere. Ronchant's is a huge office now. - Duval associated with him. - Bastard! When is the contest? In 15 days. Fifteen days! It's so short! Sorry, but it took me a few weeks to find you. - Are you hiding or what? - Ideas don't come in 15 days. I can use what I did five years ago, but there's a lot to do. My best idea came in a few seconds on the tube scribbling on the ticket. It's an ideas contest. You only need one idea. - If you prefer, I can call Ronchant... - Who do you think I am? You think I want my revenge on Ronchant? I don't care! In fact, they've been doing my promotion. Did you want to see me again? Tell me clearly. Do you say that to your kids when they say they love you? I never said it would be easy. It's the first time a woman is selected. It's not fortuitous. They want someone in touch with the real world. Yes, in touch! - They don't know you have a child. - Two. It doesn't show. Your children, that's your edge on Duval. I didn't know I was meeting the Legendre & Sons office. - Sorry. - Will you manage? Yes. I suppose that you work with an architect's office for the budget? Okay, I'll deal with it. Thanks, you're adorable. Careful with what you say. I'm off. Are you sure you're not forgetting anything? Am I crazy or what? It's okay. I'll explain it to you. It's important you understand because it's my life. My project was accepted. The hospital. Okay, my angel? That's why Mommy is going to work a lot because she can't miss such an opportunity. I'm going to be a bit selfish. Okay? But just for two weeks. It's nothing. Fifteen sleeps. It's not long. All right, my love? There you go. You're in the sun. It's good vitamin D. Oh, no, no. Don't cry today, my angel. Not today. Not that. No, no! Look, my love. Here you go! My angel. It's not that. Where did I put this bloody file? It's not that... No, my baby, don't cry. Yes! Hello? - - - Eva? - Yes. It's Pascale Mathieu. - - - Pascale? - Yes. Okay. The Ronchants, Duval and Co had their war council? - - - What? - Nothing. I'm rocking... listening. Relax, breathe. I'm no longer at the Ronchant's. I left those dicks four years ago. I'm working with Marc. Ah. Wait a second. There. There. This! Look! There you go. Okay, my angel? There you go. - Eva? - Yes! - Excuse me. How are you? - - - I'm good. What do you do with Marc exactly? I set up my company. I have my architect's office. - Ah, okay... - - - We have to meet up soon. If you want to work with me. Of course! When? - Now. - Now? Yes, yes... - 36 Louvre Street. - - - Okay. Eva? Yes? Excuse me. It's complicated now. I can't make it. - - - I can't. - Well... In two hours. It's okay for me. Really? No problem. - Will you be finished? - Yes, no problem. You have the silkscreen printing in 30 minutes. - Okay. - Great. He's cute. Is he your nephew? No. It's not my nephew, it's yours! My nephew? No, he's not. Not your nephew, your baby. What do you mean, mine? The baby... my baby! My angel, what are you doing here? Is she mad? It's full of dust here. My darling... Did she abandon Darius too? No, he's at school. He eats at the cafeteria. He's out at 4:30 p.m. She hopes she'll have time to pick him up. And you have a meeting at 5:00 with the painter. - Eva Gautier isn't here? - She's waiting. Eva? Eva? Pascale! I wouldn't have recognized you. A real business woman. - What did Marc say? - He's showing off! He tells everyone that he found you. - You're kidding? - No! We've all dreamed of what's happening to you. For five years, everybody's been wondering where you are. I thought you were in South America and that we'd discover a new Brasilia. No, I just had two kids. It sounds silly, but I really feel that I created something. That's what people say, yes. When you don't have kids, you can't understand it. Well, yes. Okay. Eva, let me explain. I created a new concept, between the architect and the contractor. We oversee the budget and also the architect's look. It has become super important now. Everything works with contests now. We prepare them. They have to be in top condition. You're tackling Europe, Eva. Send me the file you submitted, and my team will start on the budget. I'll deal with the look and psychology aspect. That's because I breastfeed. So... But I think I was very lucky. No. You were the most utopian. You won. Did you bring the plans? Okay. Fax me the plans later. You work hard tomorrow. The next day, we read the file. We go to Strasbourg in four days. - That's Monday. - They're all on site already. Of course. - Book her a ticket. - Hello. Is the star coming? I can push my appointments, but I have work. Eva Gautier. You're late. Hello. What did you do all night? - Huh? - You're hurting me. It must be effective. You can't come every week. The joys of the countryside! What is this? An electric micro-peeling that will smoothly remove your wrinkles, your scars, everything. Without a trace? You know Laurent. At night, I'm his Barbie doll. In bed, I have to be impeccable! No hair, no spots. Impeccable. Just a few scabs. Are you sure it's good? Do you trust me? You Barbie doll! - It's hot! - Yes, it feels good. Fuck Eva Legendre's voicemail! Why does she have a mobile? It's just a voicemail. She said she'd be two hours. Hello! I love babies. Yeah, right... And on the day of the meeting! - When are they coming? - Soon. I need practice, but she left bottles. I can look after him. - Where did she go? - She said you knew. Know what? It's mad! Sorry, sorry, my baby. Sorry, Philippe! Take him, in case he pukes on my suit. My baby, my angel. It's serious. It's very serious, what she just did. What's wrong with you? You're in a state, sweetie pie! You need a big cuddle from your big sister. My baby, my poor baby... It's normal. Your son crushes your tits every three hours. You're a milk cow. - And your man doesn't look at you. - No! Of course that's why, I'm telling you! You have baby blues, that's all. - No! - Yes! No! It's because I don't love anybody anymore! I don't care about anything! I don't care about Philippe. I don't care about the baby, or Darius who I should pick up from school. I don't care about anything. And I can't find the fucking file, Alice! I can't find it! And Tabata, you don't care about her? I forgot your daughter! I'm such a loser! Alice, do you have a phone? I forgot Tabata! Do you have a phone, please? I forgot your daughter! What a loser! Hello? Is Tabata with you? Yes. My sister-in-law forgot. Can you look after her? Thanks, we're coming. I'll go right now. No, she's finished. Haven't you? I can't go out like this, I'm all red! No, but... I'm sorry, I have a lot on my mind at the moment. But I'm a bitch, I'm a disgrace. Don't put yourself in that state. It's okay. I'll go get my daughter. Are you sure? Yes. The teacher will look after her. She'll get extra pay. - Do you think I'm stressed? - How can you be so cool? I have a gift for happiness! He's hungry. He doesn't want the bottle. He wants breast, he wants his mother. Calm down, my angel. Mommy abandoned you, my sweetheart. He's going to puke on my suit, I know. She didn't abandon him. It's normal she flips out. You're looking for another architect. I can feed him if you want. No. I'm the father, I'll do it. You're right, Meryl. I'll convince them to use Eva. She's a great architect. Oh damn, he got me! You're touching. So touching. Ah, Mrs. Lemaître. Did you receive my fax? In 15 days, you'll be in front of the jury. You have to be a top model! You have the ideas, but your look... - Top zero! - That's not the problem. They spot mothers straight away. Less available than men, less sleep, so less efficient, less productive. It's morphopsychology. They'll analyze you! We'll say goodbye to Juliette. Bye, Juliette! - No. - Let's tackle it. Don't bother me with that. I destroyed everything I did before Philippe. I'm an idiot. No. It's all in your head. Deep in your unconscious. You have to sleep and dream. Write down all your dreams. The European pilot hospital will reappear. I wake up every three hours to feed him. Not much space left for dreams. Laurent used to get up every three hours. So even if Philippe is my brother... Alarm clock. It's just two weeks. He'll be fine. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Did you bring the file for the salon? You forgot, of course. It doesn't matter! Tomorrow... It can wait. - It's not that. - Really? I'm lactating. It's breastfeeding time. Too fast? - Daddy. - How does this thing work? We'll manage. Yes, my baby. I'm not Mommy, but we'll manage. We'll manage. - Daddy! - Yes, I'm coming! Look what I did. Funny, no? You'll see. And now, the big snake is going to bite you! No? I fucked up your day, but I don't care. I'm tired. I have to sleep and to dream above all. I'm going to be selfish. Be selfish. It will do you good. It's my fault. I blundered last night. I'm an idiot. You need to work again for good, have a big project. You have to go for it. And my role is to help you. Did I say the right thing? I love you so much! I don't regret marrying you. I'll go for it, I promise. It will be huge. Huge! They're giving me the hotel. It's official. Wait. I want my wife to be the architect. I want to be the essential design team of our time. They talk about me, they buy, they publish articles, thanks to you. Well... a bit thanks to me and a bit thanks to you. What would I be without you? Still painting unsellable pictures. But it's impossible! It's impossible, Philippe! Are you doing it on purpose? Just when I'm shortlisted for the European hospital! You want me to become nothing? What are you talking about? Your old project? Okay. I'll explain the old project. In two days, the fridge will be empty. You'll have to do the shopping. I won't pick up your shoes and socks. You'll have to put the cap on your toothpaste. If you cook, I won't tidy up behind you. No more kitchen hand. The hospital that you missed? Well, yeah. And the hotel? We won't do it together? Clients will wait, cuddles will wait. The children too. Two weeks without me, the world won't fall apart! You know what? I won't tidy up the house tonight. I cleaned up the mess yesterday. Some guys make, and some guys break. Wait. Don't you think you lay it on thick? I don't understand. It's really mean of you. It's really lame. Your mess is messier than my mess. I don't care. You won't lock me up in the sticks. I sold you to my clients! For 15 days, I have to work for myself. Tonight, I must sleep and dream. Mostly dream. - He's hungry. - I won't breastfeed anymore. Very well. So what? You'll get up at night to feed him, like now. It was my turn. Next time, it's for you. Okay! I'm not here. I have to sleep and dream. Yeah, go to sleep and dream! Shit... Hello? No, sorry. She's sleeping. Madam is dreaming. Who is it? - Marc what? - I'm here! Marc, how are you? Yes. You're not waking me up, I was going to work. Yes, he's filtering calls. Tell me. Any progress? Did you see Pascale? It was a good idea, no? I knew it. She tells everybody that she found you. It's so nice to hear you! Tell me things, tell me what's happening. She's still waiting for your plans. She wanted to start now. I know, but I have a problem. I don't have the plans anymore. I don't have the file. Do you have a fax? I can't hear you. Can you put the sound down? Of course. - - - I'll send you the plans. - What? You have my file? I keep everything, like old people. Hang up, I'll fax them over. You're so great! I love you! Thank you so much! This guy is a lucky charm. - It's your Pygmalion? - Yes, he made me! He's giving me energy. I feel like working. I'm not tired anymore. Yes, he's a great guy. Is it the file that you were looking for? If you had called me, if you had talked to me, I would have told you that I had your files at the studio, classified so that you can find them. At the clinic, you asked me to empty the cupboard. Mind you... you were right, the baby's stuff is tidy now. And your files too. Neat and tidy. Your Marc pisses me off. PILOT PROJECT FOR A EUROPEAN HOSPITAL IN STRASBOURG. Mommy, I want a "koalate." No, let go of my braid. - Mommy, I want a "koalate." - No. No cuddle now. It's not the right time, I'm working. I want a "koalate"! Mommy! My darling needs a "koaddle." And Mommy loves him so much. - Stop, Darius! - Mommy! A little cuddle and Mommy's going to work. Go to bed! I want a "koalate"! What's the matter with you? You had your cuddle. I want a... Come on, Mommy! You're driving me nuts. It's not the right time. Come on now. Stop immediately! Stop it! - "Koalate"! - Go cuddle your bed! You bed will replace your Oedipus. Come out immediately! It's never cool with you. Okay. Mommy's sad. Mommy's calming down. And Mommy goes. Goodbye! Mommy's going. Mommy's leaving you alone. You're going to come out on your own, like a big boy. Good night. There you go. It's simple. You can't do that to me. It hurts. My nose hurts. Holy crap. Come out right now. Go to bed! At this time, all the children in the world are asleep! No! Don't make yourself vomit! Mommy will get angry. You'll be three in three days. You can get a smack! I'm going far away. Mommy's leaving you alone. No, she's not leaving you alone. Mommy's going to the lounge because she's tired. He doesn't love me. It's his revenge because I'm working. What's wrong? Oh! What's happening? He blew my septum, but he unblocked my neck. It's all right. It's all right. - What time is it? - Nine o'clock! Shit! I forced him to go back to sleep! Don't move. I'll deal with it. It's a very bad start. I'll never make it. I want a "koalate," Daddy. Of course. Daddy will make you chocolate milk. "Koalate." I'll kill them. - I want you, Daddy. - You want me? That's so great! I'll be right back. This kid is in love with you! You're stopping him from having a regular Oedipus! You're his god, you never scold him, I'm always the one doing it. What's Oedipus got to do with it? This Marc guy is getting on my tits! - Philippe! - He stirs up the shit! - Philippe, I have to find a nanny. - I'll call Juliette. She must know. - No, not Juliette. - Okay, not Juliette. - Your secretary? - Not Meryl and her shitty advice. We could drown them or abandon them on the road. Philippe, you'll help me, won't you? I'll negotiate some time to think. I'll ask them for 15 extra days. I sold you to them. I need you. - We'll present them a project later. - Very good! I'm off to Strasbourg on Monday. Okay. I'm calling Juliette. We're having fun, my darling. We'll have fun all morning. This way, Mommy can work all afternoon. Shall we make peace? Give Mommy a kiss. That's my Laurent! Hello! I found someone. A girl. My neighbor knows her mother. She has six siblings. She's used to kids. She's giving up school. A plain Jane. But we know her mother. Two hundred francs. Come, come! I can pretend I forgot the keys. Stop stressing out. Let go. You have the monitor. Have a little trust. A nanny isn't the solution. When I had one, between my earnings and her pay, I had 1,000 francs left. It wasn't worth working. Now, I have a new life. Do you remember the state I was in? I repeated all the time, "What a stress!" - Don't you remember? - I remember very well. - We have no choice. - I can look after them! It's not a solution. Really? - "It's not a solution." - "We have to see..." "Yeah, wait and see..." Shit! We're expecting you for a last briefing. We have things to show you. We're waiting for you here. What are you going to do? - What am I going to do? - Yes. I'm leaving tomorrow. You'll look after the kids. - Don't make me-- - Shh! Don't make me feel guilty. It's hard enough. No way! He's feeling guilty! We said we'd be equal. We are. But I have to finish the restaurant mural. The contest is tomorrow. I did the photos. - The hotel is sold. I'm sorry! - I'm sorry too! Why should I put my project on hold and not you? Why should I feel guilty if Darius would only eat with me? Why should I feel guilty if I miss his birthday tomorrow? If I feel guilty, it doesn't mean you should feel the same. - Hello? - - - Eva? - I need a hotel plan for this weekend. - I can't make a plan now. I mean an idea. I managed to hook up with my boyfriend. Do you know a hotel? - No. - A-- I won't ditch the hotel, it's huge! To hell with your hotels! Isn't a hospital huge? 300 bedrooms, 300 armchairs, 300 chairs, 300 beds! 700 rooms! And not just design. Humanity! CAR RENTAL You'll see the Spaniard, the German and the Belgian, because it's the European hospital. But Strasbourg is in France. So they don't stand much chance. You see the old guy? The one who's your age? But he looks his age. It's Duval, unofficially supported by the Board. A support more important than mine. Here's the Region Council with the jury. They all smile at each other. Hypocrites... It's all anonymous. And there's you. So be great! Count on me. Hello. Eva Gautier. Hello. What is she doing? She's nuts. - So? - What? I saw you scribbling. Show me your notebook. - There's nothing. - No. I don't have to do everything like you. You're blowing up everything. This hospital is our baby. If it works, we'll be together for two years. You won't have to hold my hand for two years. - You signed a contract with Pascale. - So what? So you're working for me. Eva, it's work. Don't pull that face. It's normal. I see. Hello. Hello, Meryl. I'll take the mail, and then I'm off. - It's here. - Darius is at school? Mrs. Lemaître, urgent. She's coming at 8 p.m. with an architect for the hotel. What architect? No, no! Two days off are two days off. I can't. You didn't tell me. I confirmed. - What time? - 8 p.m., big dinner, the whole shebang. You scared me! I'm sorting out my flowers. Some thugs destroyed them. But I'm hanging on. Yes, everything's okay. - You drove with the baby on your knees? - It was that or drowning him. It's a mess, Juliette. I can't take it. Marc, the hospital. I have too much work. Bad timing. Keep schtum, or Eva won't work again. She gives it all up and kills me. What a stress! I took some things haphazardly. Cream, pacifier... everything was in the wash. Will you manage? You're the one who doesn't manage. Laurent had something tomorrow. He'll have to stay. I don't want trouble with your man. He can skip his captain's birthday. They're a tight team. Every week they celebrate something. I'm fed up with always being on my own. Are you all right, Juju? Better than you. Hello, you've reached Philippe Gautier's voicemail. Leave me a message, and I'll call you back. I'm very happy to work with you. Me too. I usually work with my wife. We complement each other, and we work fast. We have to be up to the job. - You'll have the plans in eight days. - Eight days. You can't beat that. I'm sorry about your wife, but before signing, I need guarantees. No problem. On the contrary, she has a lot of projects on. It's better this way. It's my baby, not yours! Oh, the ball! We'll transform little Darius! Two days with Auntie Juliette, and Mom won't recognize you! - All right, honey bunny? - Yes! Blimey! Stop watering the garden all day! Look at that. It's mud! My shoes are all mucked! - What are these pants? - What? Instead of throwing away old clothes, I use them in the garden. Come on, kids! Enough with video games! Careful, I'm coming! - Hello? - Hello, darling? Why are you calling this number? I wanted to see you I want you! - Not on this number! - I knew it was you. You don't know. I'm here because of the strike. But you don't know! I know, because I see you. What are you talking about? - Daddy, let's dance tamouré. - What tamouré? I'm on the phone! I'm coming later for the dance! I'm on the phone. - I'm calling you-- - No, I'm calling. Absolutely! Juliette is in the garden. I wanted to call you last night, but it's a mess. - Your sister left us her kids. - Wait, you can't do this to me! I can't leave Juliette. I can't leave her alone. I booked a great hotel. The perfect place to make babies. - What? - I'm joking. I have to go. I promise... I swear, I promise that next week, we'll go there together. I told her that I had a meeting with the union. - Okay? I'm hanging up. - Laurent, I'm coming! No! She's coming. I can't. Laurent, I'm going to make a big mess... Goodbye, sir. - You look worried. - The strike is going to be very hard. Don't worry. Let's go to the garden! Not the garden! Let's dance tamouré here! Come on, tamouré! Tamouré! Tamouré! - Yes? - - - Hello, Eva? I have to talk to you. It really is a bad time. I have problems with my boyfriend. Where are you? You're not home. I need to see you. I don't have time for your boyfriend or your shop. Leave me alone. I'm in Strasbourg. Bye. Is that why your kids are at Juliette's? - What are you talking about? - - - I'm in front of Juliette's house. Your kids are at Juliette's dancing tamouré, and it's a mess! - - - A big mess! - I don't believe it. - It can't be. - - - Yes! Zero responsibility. You thought you knew his thoughts with your stupid telepathy. Stop it. Go get them. I'll take the first flight. You can't ask me that. Be nice, go get them. It's Darius' birthday. I made a cake. Go get them. You don't get it. Eva, my boyfriend-- I can't ask you anything. Bye. It's Laurent! No, it's Christine. Your appointment is waiting. I'm coming, Christine! A present for you. It may help. Thank you. What about the plans? Are they coming? Not yet, but soon. Would it be horizontal, vertical? I don't know. More vertical. Just so you know, it's not possible. I know, vertical is more expensive. Ask your engineer to work on materials. There's the technical part to do. It finishes tonight. We have to know quickly. Okay. I have the cake... I mean... the concept. The urban world takes you away from life. We have to go back to the ancestral concept of the city. It's life. I don't know. We have to use noble materials. We have to work on light, let light through. That's tired. Brussels already did it with disabled people, darling. A hospital is a hospital. It's not a mental health facility. It's no longer trendy. Okay, that's it. I have nothing. I'm going to leave. I only had that. I did three little sketches. Use that. Eva, you can't do that. The deadline is in two days. If the jury has the file before the presentation, it's a plus. I remind you that I'm in the jury. You'll do like the other jury members. Clown Laurent and clown Juliette are celebrating Darius' birthday! Okay? Come on! Darius! Darius! Darius! One, two, three! Well done! She baked a cake. Eva, you're already here? You look gorgeous dressed like this. And a big one. A birthday cake with cream and candy everywhere. - They were having fun. - I was sure it'd be fine. I'm sick of your sister! I didn't have a choice. Juliette did her best. You're having a ball! I didn't know you were here. In fact, you were here. - So... - What? - Hélène is bringing an architect. - "Hélène"? - My client. Lemaître. - Oh yeah! Hélène... You see, I asked for a few days, and you're bringing in another architect. - Why did you do that? - I didn't have a choice. - You have no choice today. - Don't blame me. I juggle everything. - It was small things. - Bastard. If it works, it's two years of work. Then, you'll get recognition. We have to do our projects separately. - Don't you love me anymore? - You're getting mixed up. - All we did was my reason to live. - I don't want you to sacrifice yourself. Sacrifice? I'm talking about love, and you hear "sacrifice." You're getting everything mixed up. You say I don't help you, that you want to be selfish, that you must do what you always wanted, and when I find a solution, you change your mind? It's easy to say that. How are you talking to me? You know what? I'm bored with you. You don't have friends, we don't go out, we don't party... We make love in ten minutes. There's only work, work, work. We do it in ten minutes because of the kids. We don't see our friends as we're the only ones with kids. You're young, but you're old. I'm fed up. I have work. Yes, I have work. I hate you. You know what? You took everything from me. I feel old. Fuck! You're horrible. You knocked me up. You milked me. I was there, day and night. And now, you toss me like an old sock. What do you think I am, a pole? You don't even notice me. You're pissing me off now! We're free. And now I'm off because you really... That's it, fuck off! I'm able to raise my kids alone and give them a life too! It's really unfair! You don't love me? Fuck off, I don't care. - Stop! - Stay a bit longer, please. I can't, honey bunny. Juliette is waiting. I said I was going to the loo. Tell her you're sick. In any case, there's nothing more to say. I couldn't make time. - Are you afraid? - No. I promise that we'll spend next weekend together. I told her I had a meeting with the union. Kiss me! I can't believe it! Mommy is surprising us, and Auntie Juliette is tipsy. Auntie Juliette is pissing me off! Who's the mother? I'm the mother. What did I do? You stole my role as a mother! That's what you've done! I'm able to bake a cake! You have no right to speak to me like that. It's unfair. I'm trying to help everybody. I have to understand everybody. My brother, my kids, my husband, my sister-in-law! - I didn't ask for anything. - I know what you think of me. - You despise me. - Mommy! Go to your bedroom! Nothing's easy! For me as for others. "Juliette smiles, Juliette doesn't work, Juliette is plain, Juliette is dumb." "Juliette is a cuckold!" I never said that. I'm saying it. Juliette is a cuckold. I have proof. When I get in the car, I have to move the seat. She has long legs. Like a top model. Juliette is a cuckold! You have to talk to him. I know. I may need you to look after the kids this weekend. - Okay, count on me. - I'm fed up. I'll wait till he comes back from the loo. He thinks I'm an idiot. And I'll confront him. - Hi, Eva. - Hi. Are you okay? What's wrong with the toilets? I'm soaking wet. I'm going. Bye. What's wrong? Happy birthday, my angel. Even if your birthday is today, we'll bake another cake tomorrow. Okay? We'll make another cake just for you, okay? Mommy, what is a cuckold? What is a cuckold? Alice. Alice! What's wrong with you? - Alice, what are you doing? - I didn't do anything. I was sleeping, that's all. Why are you here? It's not the right time. Philippe left. He slammed the door. I was sure! No wonder, you're so edgy with your contest. You got us all exhausted. I'm giving it up. I don't care. I don't care about the hospital, the sick people, everything! This hospital brings me bad luck. That's it, sacrifice yourself for him. You have to bring them what women bring to humanity. Instinct! I as in Instinct, N as in Nature, H as in Happiness... R as in Remove your glasses. What did you do? What happened? Who's the guy who did this? Ditch him! It's not a guy, it's me. I did my eyelids. Are you crazy? Your eyelids were great. 35 years of eyelids batting. After a while, they sag. If he doesn't love you as you are, leave him. You know what the idea of the century is? That we're all the same. No more men and women. We have kids equally, we raise kids equally, we work equally. That's the idea of the century. That we become hermaphrodites. That's it. That we're all snails. You're exaggerating. It's so pretentious. I'm building a family. It's more fragile than any building. Why should you choose? I have no regrets. I know what I'm doing. I want to laugh again, like Juliette. No more contest. Don't take her as an example. She's the typical cuckold. She is. - Really? - She knows everything. She's a witch. What does she know? She knows that Laurent is cheating on her with a gorgeous girl. Really? She's not that stupid after all. I'm bouncing back. Eva, I needed to see you. Here! Flowers from the garden. Okay. Are you still looking after the kids this weekend? Why? - What's happening? - Did you tell her? Good. I'm going under the knife. I'm doing it all: belly, face lift, cellulite, and eyelids, for free. The lot. In love, only actions matter. By the way, the surgeon you recommended is top. Yes, he's great. But I didn't think you'd do it. I just spoke to him. He's doing me as an emergency this weekend. He's top-notch! Am I right or not? If he's the love of your life, each to his own. If you get him back this way, great. You have my full support. Yes, full support. What about Laurent? He wants me to do it. He's paying for the surgery. He canceled something this weekend to stay with me. It's to save our marriage. He made me throw my old clothes. Tomorrow, he's coming with me. He's buying me a new wardrobe, 20,000 francs. And I broke all the crockery. I was sick of it. We'll buy a new one. I feel in top form! He wants to start over. How could he say that? I cornered him. I found a cigarette stub in the car. The girl smokes Cartier. What an idiot! - I'm not saying it for you. - No, of course. I admire you. You're fighting for something. She's dumb! She's dumb! You're pissing me off with your husbands! You're completely stupid, senile! You have water in your brain! I'm so happy to be alone with no kids! It's all your fault. - What's wrong? - What's wrong? You admire jerks! Yes, jerks! And you don't realize. You're lobotomized, you silly cow! Redo your alphabet. A as in Adore, B as in Brainless! C as in Cretinous! D as in Dumb! Don't you see what you're willing to do for these idiots? Look at her, with her surgery! You'll have scars everywhere. It will take six months to recover. And you ditch everything to mollycoddle your kids, stroke their heads and reduce their brain to a pea and turn them into clones of Laurent! - Philippe. - That's it. G as in Goodbye! Are you crazy or what? You won't get away with insulting me! If your life is a failure, if your work is all you have, it's not my fault. If you're jealous, it's not my fault. Jealous of what? I couldn't stand having a guy every day in my bathroom. I love my freedom! I don't envy you! If I bang a married guy, it's to avoid enduring what you endure! Philippe, are you here? I know you're here. Answer. If you listen to this message... I'm going to bed. I don't know what to say. Me neither. Well, come home. If ever-- I decided not to do the contest tomorrow. I don't have any ideas. I'm giving up. I don't have any ideas. Bye. I made a mistake, Meryl. Kids, family life, we made a big mistake. I can't do it anymore. It's not my thing. You're wrong, Philippe. Kids are the only beautiful thing. As long as you don't have any, you don't know. Go home. I'll manage. - Are you sure? - Yes, don't worry. - Good night. - Thank you. Baby, where are you going? It's no time to play. - Fallen! - Darius! Fallen! Fallen! Darius! Darius, where are you? Darius, my love, what's going on? Wake up, my baby! What an idiot! Why did I sleep? I'M AT THE HOSPITAL, EVA Let's go, darling. Don't worry, Mommy's here. It's okay, I'm here. You're okay, sweetie? Talk to me, say something. Your head hurts, is that it? Did you bang your head? Tell Mommy, darling. Tell Mommy if your head hurts. Shit! It's nothing, darling. It's normal. It's good to vomit. It's good. We're nearly there. Vomit all you can. It doesn't matter at all. Mommy is happy that you vomit. Okay, my angel? We're nearly there. MOTHER HOTEL Shit! Shit! It's crazy. - Come here, darling. - Is the Thomasson child here? Of course. He's been here for three hours. It's your turn, my boy. Mommy! - Mommy! - You can't come to the OR. - Sorry. - Mommy. Eva? Oh! Wake up, sleepy heads! Get up! School! Contest! Someone slept with Mommy when I was away! Didn't you? Eva? I'm such a dick! I've just called her house. No answer. I can't believe it! Darius! Daddy's here, darling. It's okay. He's fine. But we have to wait seven hours to be sure. Did you come for me or him? I needed to breathe, to unwind. You went too far, Eva. I love you. I only love you. Say it again. I love you. I love you. I love you! Go home. I'll take over. I can't go home. I don't want to. Then go! Go for it, Eva! What are you doing? I'm sorry. I can't help it. My love. Mommy's going to work. You'll stay with Daddy. You'll be proud of Mommy, love. There. Here. And the hotel? What are you doing here? It's okay, we'll both go. Taxi! - Eva, the baby! Your baby! - Please! Please! I'll talk about the coherence of various hospital sectors. I place them on the same level, to make them easily accessible to patients. Mrs. Gautier, you misread your notification time. - You're no longer a candidate. - You're disturbing Mr. Duval. I'm not a candidate. Too bad. I've just realized something. Be serious, Madam. You're mistreating your child. It's too late. If you get your ideas on the tube, it's not of our concern. It's natural selection. It's life. Do you know what it's like to have children and overlook them? Pretend they didn't exist? You don't have to justify yourself. If you're here to champion the "nappy and baby bottle" ideology, we don't have a single second for you. You have built on ideology, not me. Sick people are excluded from our society. I can see what you do in your plan: compartmentalizing. We don't need caves to hide from predators. You have to decompartmentalize, show the sick. I'm like them. An outcast who won't hide anymore. Please leave, Mrs. Gautier. It's improper. You're discrediting yourself, and you're attacking a candidate. Duval shouldn't be worried. I came without a project nor a plan. She's aggressive as she has nothing to offer. You're making a fool of yourself. Stay, Mr. Duval. This is a farce. Let's hear her vital proposition. Give it to me. Pascale. We have to be above the city. On top of a hill. You're enclosing. It's a classic. I'm putting it above. It makes all the difference. Do it on a mountain, with chalets. In Switzerland. The site is flat for miles. Classic. It's the ABC. Flat, for the patients. Your files are flat too. We can create the hill to build above the city. Like castles. Thanks! These are the car parks and the hospital buildings. Overlook... A tower with a curvy and soft shape. It will focus the attention of the city people. A tower is a signal. A tower is also a symbol of integration to society. Breathe, look straight ahead, with a perspective towards the south, the sun, the light. Light is important. Decompartmentalize, let light in. Not too much! We need relaxation areas, reception rooms, for families. Make it more human. We need to have convenience stores, a pharmacy, a kindergarten, for families. The family makes you want to fight to get better. And you need spaces for creative activities: pottery, video, library... Clowns! Clowns are important. You have to laugh! You're overstepping your role. You're not a therapist. Your concept is irrational. A space where different people work together is irrational? Patients need to learn again how to live and communicate. We have to create bridges. Bridges everywhere. They're no longer in a hole. They're surrounded by trees. And there's a big glass-walled room overhanging. They can enjoy the view. And all around, there are moats, like a fortified castle. There, people are happy, they're having fun. With a patio, nautical bases, windsurf. Splash. There's water all around, and the exterior comes to us. Well, to them. Water is life. That's okay, we got the idea. And corn, wheat, sunflowers... Bravo, you're a great actress, but you'll turn the Board against you. You're recycling old clichés. You hammer home an out-of-date debate. Yes, but it's my vision. I won't compromise with my humanism. Isn't that why I was shortlisted? Do you remember my retirement home? Feeling at home, inventing a decor that can change, because it's alive. Sorry. I won't be long now. You wanted a concept, an idea. Here it is. Let's go. One, two, three! Happy birthday, Darius! You want to open the presents before eating the cake? Open your presents. Come and see what I brought you. I bought it new for 1,500 francs. - You can have it for 800. - No, 500. I have to lose one size. My thigh tuck is recent. Where's Alexis? Okay, for 500 francs. I know you're no longer an architect-- Darius, do the picture with your little brother. My husband and I thought you'd accept... Darius, do the picture with your little brother. I know you're no longer an architect. - Pénélope! - Okay, for 500 francs. Darius, do the picture with your little brother. No! Alexis, no! No problem. Thanks a lot. Bye. - No! - Eva! Wake up, my love. Calm down. It's nothing. I'm here. It's just a nightmare. You've got it! My love, you've been chosen. Marc just called. You'll get a letter. You won! - I won? - It's great! - I won? - You won. - It's not true. - It is! - I won. - Yes. It will be... - Mommy! - It will be... Mommy, "koalate"! Mommy, "koalate"! TO PATRICK...
