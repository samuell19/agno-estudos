'The devil flies on broken angel wings. 'Naked. Free.' 'And so their journey began. 'Their only kill? 'A bullet for a wounded guide, 'the only one of them that knew a way out.' What have we got left? We've got a little fire left. I'm about done. A little lead? A little powder. Where's your gun? 'Absent any shred of bravery, 'fear quickly poisoned their shallow hearts. 'Fear of the Blackfoot. 'Fear of the wilderness. 'Fear of each other. 'Fear of themselves.' Let me see what I can find. 'European hunters had devastated the bison. 'Settlers had brought sickness and plague. 'The cavalry brought hollow treaties, and then massacres. 'And now the First Nations defend their land by spilling blood.' All dead. What'd you see? Nothing. Everything's gone. No packhorses? 'The first morning, they were strong. 'The rifleman led the way. 'He believed his were the strides of destiny. 'Perfect in his mind. 'The others followed... '...thankful to be led by the confident. 'But soon, the cold crept in. 'And then the rivers... '..and the ice... '...and the wind... '...and another night.' 'It was my job to keep the fire burning at night 'and the wood stacked in front of the house. 'When my mother woke to a cold home and no wood, 'she was pretty angry. 'She sent me to the forest to gather wood, 'and my older sister was kind enough to help. 'My father volunteered for the Confederacy. 'He was killed in his first battle. 'His guns were returned as a gesture for his honor. 'But my mother said they were a curse, and a tribute to hatred. 'She hid them away, and never spoke of my father again.' 'But the hatred was patient.' It's quite an introduction. Let's start over. In this territory, I'm the judge, the jury, and unfortunately the punisher. My job is to sift through chaos. And we have a lot of chaos to sift through. You, my little friend, have got to help me come to an understanding of what all this... I have a granddaughter. She's just a little younger than you are. She also has a keen mind. Her imagination is a glory to behold. And I see that you, too, are gifted with fiction. But my granddaughter doesn't sow death wherever she goes. Now, being white and Christian goes a long way in my courtroom. And I have a special affinity for the female persuasion. Now, I want you to continue. But choose your words carefully, because I'm the only hope you have. Before your men discovered our home, they had been lost for days. They sent a man to ask us for food and supplies, and we gave what we could. But they weren't satisfied. 'When strong men face catastrophe, 'they hand together. 'They strengthen their union for survival. 'Weak men sow division.' This is all they could spare. Potatoes. 'Some of them had a plan. 'And nothing was gonna change that, no matter what we gave. Vote. No. I'll be back for every one of you. I'll drag you all to hell. 'And then they came for my family. 'I stayed with my sisters all night in the cold. 'I never found my mother. 'As long as there is a God, there is a devil. 'And where there is no God, there is the devil.' 'The day before, the murderers had been so blood drunk 'they had never found my father's guns. 'They were cold. 'And heavy. 'And hateful. 'In the trees, the devil waited, as if our time was appointed. 'I prayed. 'Hatefully prayed. 'Prayed that devil was my companion. 'Prayed I'd have the courage to end my shame. 'And as my finger touched that frozen metal... '..the devil rose where God had fallen. 'And the devil knew that he had arrived in hell.' 'And the devil was mine. 'And I the devil's. 'Hell was ours to deliver. 'The wilderness cast no judgment. 'All men drift the Earth as listless shadows. 'The righteous, the wicked, the barren... '...floating weightless in the tangle of the forest. 'But here, all our corpses fall. 'Drawn back to the dirt from whence we sprang. 'Stripped of our quickness, 'the bearing of our deeds vanishes swiftly, 'and vanity is effortlessly relinquished. 'In this the devil knows 'that wrath must be delivered forthwith, 'for he has but a short time.' I know this place. There's a hunting camp three days from here. Well, take us. I'll need a gun. There's nothing in here but a chair. For the price of another man's life, he got his gun. But they didn't kill him. He was beaten. His gun was taken. He was left to starve, or freeze. There is no mercy, no honor. He was just left broken like they broke my family. Would you like to know what happened then? 'A blizzard had swept through the night before. 'We were lucky to come across a trapper's cabin in the morning. 'The stench of iniquity blew in the wind. 'Our first allotment had been granted.' I'm sorry. I'm so very sorry. I was... just following orders. They tricked me. They took my gun. I'm sorry. Don't hit me no more. 'Truly I say to you, 'you will never get out until you have paid the last penny.' I'm killed. 'An eye for an eye. 'Vengeance is never appeased. 'It feasts on its own rancor. 'And with every ration 'it only grows more ravenous... '...and relentless.' 'The men trudged on blindly... '...deaf to the song of the coming truth. 'The storm had to cover their tracks. 'The winds had stolen their pungence. 'Assistance was required. 'It is what is delivered by hand that measures a man's mark. 'And by that mark we judge one's worth.' They murdered my family. 'The meek have inherited the Earth. 'Our direction determined by the shrewd. 'We believe we lead, but we are coerced from behind. 'Blazing paths, predetermined steps by design. 'We have become fruitless. 'Our roots frozen in stone.' You do believe in our Lord, do you not? I believe in the Lord, but I've seen the devil. I have a secret I want to share with you. The man that you say is leading this batch of wretched souls is none other than my brother. What do you think of that? I think that your blood flows in a river of emptiness. Young lady, no man is innocent, but what you'd have me believe about my brother... Ridiculous. He's a good Christian, as am I. It's time for you to tell me where he is. I want answers now. Where is he? I think you'll find your brother. But let me explain where he is. 'You shall not kill. 'And whoever kills shall be liable to judgement. 'But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother 'shall be liable to judgement. 'Whoever insults his brother shall be liable to the council. 'And whoever says you fool, shall be liable to the hell of fire. Come and offer your gift at the altar. Leave your gift in there before the altar and go. 'Even possession of a pistol 'cannot harden the backbone of the craven. 'Mistrust devours the heart, blotting the mind with dread. 'But penances comes unannounced. 'For the life of the creature is in the blood. 'And God has given it to us to make atonement on the altar. 'The frail of fear was now unmistakable. 'Their blood lust had grown. 'Rather than trust a lone woodsman, 'who had graciously offered them to partake in his hunt, 'suspicion and cowardice impelled them to murder him 'with a cleaver to the back of the head. 'Enough meat to feed 20 men would now be wasted on three. 'But they would never even taste the gristle. 'There is no mercy for the merciless. 'There is no forgiveness for the unforgiving.' I'll gut that deer. 'For the wrath of God is revealed 'from Heaven against all ungodliness.' 'Of righteousness.' 'What the wicked fears will come upon you. 'What the wicked fears will come upon you. 'What the wicked fears will come upon you. 'What the wicked fears will come upon you.' 'Thus I punish the world for its evil.' 'There is no man that hath power over the breath of life. 'Neither hath the power over the day of death. 'As there is no discharge in the day of battle... '...neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.' 'Thus I will punish the world for its evil, and the wicked for their iniquity.' And now you're wondering about your brother. Where is he? Would you like to see him? Yes. Get the rope. Is this really true what you're saying, or... was it the Blackfoot? They did this, right? You didn't really pray someone back from the dead, did you? Show me what he saw when you touched him. What was that? Hatred. What is this? The devil's eyes. How one dies in the devil's eyes... ...is how one returns, says the undead. All deviltry is paid. I'm running out of patience and you're running out of time. Allow me to finish with the past... ...so the future will come as it will. Your brother was a gutless coward, and that's how he'll roam. 'Hell is the reward of realized vengeance. 'With the deed done, purpose slips away. 'Most of us are lucky enough to die and rot away to nothingness. 'But those who die behind the devil's eyes 'are granted no such love. 'They may rot, 'but they never escape the devil's consciousness. 'They drift forever in their final thought. 'An unbreakable circle. 'Your brother's last moment was filled with terror.' Hello, hello. 'Forebode, the Lord is about to come out of this place 'to punish thee for the evils of the Earth.' Oh... please. 'Execute judgment by fire and by its sword on all flesh. 'And those slain by the Lord will be many. 'Do not marvel at this for an hour is coming 'in which all who... '...and will come forth. 'Those who did the good deeds to resurrection of life, 'those who committed the evil deeds to resurrection of judgement.' Get the pipes. You haven't been helpful. You haven't helped me, and you haven't helped yourself. I love the story, but this isn't the time for stories. It's time for you to hang. Rope her up. Sir, if I may, maybe we should put the mask on her. 'A pit is dug for the wicked. 'A pit is dug for the wicked. 'A pit is dug for the wicked.'
