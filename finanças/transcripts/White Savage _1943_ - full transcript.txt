[tropical island music] [music continues] [music continues] [children laughing] [knock on door] Yeah? Miller. You're getting the floor wet. Sorry, Sam, but I've just been out. - Swimming, Mr. Williams? - Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Swimmin'. It's funny the things you can find at the bottom of a swimmin' pool. Didn't you know that white men are not welcome on Temple Island? Only you, eh, Mr. Miller? I heard how a fella named Sam Miller, by special arrangements with the Princess Tahia, thought up that law out of his own head. So I sort of got to wonderin' why. Very clever, Mr. Williams. Sam, Sam, you and me make great partners. You know, once I had a partner in Hong Kong. Uh, one day, poor chap, he up and died. Why? Curiosity, my friend. He had an insatiable curiosity. He was a sucker. Listen, Sam, just give me a few of your men and the right to go ahead, and I'll come back with the bottom of that pool in my hands. Forty percent for me and sixty for you. Oh, very generous. You know, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret, Mr. Williams. It won't go no further, Sam. Yes, I know. About 12 years ago, I came here from Germany. I became the general dispenser of merchandize. In fact, I became the law. Then one day, I, too, happened to stumble on the fact that the swimming pool on Temple Island was inlaid with gold bricks and jewels. Have a cigar? They're from San Francisco. I've waited 12 years to get that gold, my friend, a fifth of a man's life. And I've been patient too. And now you go for a swim and discover my little secret. [laughs] Most amusing. And you even offer to let me in as a partner? You know, I'm gonna tell you something else. Yeah? Up till today, Sam Miller was the only white man who knew about that treasure. After today Sam Miller will still be the only one who knows about it. Sam, I... I was only trying to... [grunts] Sam. Sam! [intense music] [knock on door] - Who is it? - Erik: Erik. - Well? - The princess. Princess? Well, what about her? Her boat just passed the reef. She's evidently on her way here. [serene music] - Join us, Sam? - Hello, boys. Hello, Sam. - Any luck, Tamara? - Like every day, bad. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Believe me. But I'd feel worse if your sister were to find you here. You better go at once. She's paying us a visit. Tahia? Gentlemen, suppose we declare this an unexpected holiday. She's a nuisance. Under present circumstances, perhaps you'd better leave by the private entrance. But I have lost a lot of money. What do you say to that? You draw to too many inside straights, my boy. You better go before she finds you here. Oh, Wong. How's the professional half of Port Coral? Please. Lawyer business, pretty fair, notary public, not so good. As doctor, I delivered two babies this week, otherwise very slow. Wong... I want you to make out a death certificate for Frank Williams. He just died. Causes, please. Causes? Why, his throat sort of tightened up, couldn't breathe. Strangled, poor fella. Make out the certificate. Sorry, don't have that kind death certificate. Make out best you can. Goodbye. [instrumental music] Orano, where do you go? See fella friend. [Blossom grumbling] But, please, princess. I tell you, it is not good. A princess should not come to Port Coral. Tahia: Be quiet. Blossom: But let me go with you. No, you stay here. But, Tahia... Where is Mr. Miller? Your Highness, I'm telling you he isn't here. I don't believe you! Erik: Now, princess, a lady always... Now calm yourself. [objects breaking] Kaloe: Orano! Kaloe! Kaloe! I look everywhere for you. Well, what did the princess say? Did we get the fishing rights? Well, what are you saying? Yes or no? Both, fella fisherman. When I make like this, that means I talk to Princess Tahia. When I make like this, that's what fella princess say. Makes speech, then no. Well, looks like Miller's my last hope. He turns me down, it's back to Australia. You lie! Where is my brother? A very nice lad he is. A gentleman too. Gentleman? Because you take his money away gambling? - Where is that Mr. Miller? - I'm sure I don't know. Now why don't you relax, princess? After all, Tamara's alright. So he is here! Where does he hide? We're taking good care of the lad. Look, how about you and me getting together and form a little league for better relations between the princess and Erik, eh? [intense music] Hey, I wonder what all the excitement's about? I hope it's not what I think. [wolf whistle] Who's that? Orano! Hey! Orano, what's the matter? Orano hear someone call him far off. Meet Kaloe fella same place tonight. [instrumental music] [laughter] Why, I'm so sorry. If you'll allow me, uh, helping ladies out of difficulty is my specialty. - Please hurry. - Of course, here. [chuckles] I'm terribly sorry. - Going my way? - No. Then I'll go yours. [chuckles] You know you're kind of cute when you're mad. How dare you, you gambler! Hey, what makes you think I'm a gambler? To Port Coral, a man only comes for gamblin' or a woman. Oh, but not me. A woman just ruined my life. Port Coral women are bad. But this woman's from Temple Island. It's the princess. What has she done to you, this princess? Oh, "What has she done?" She said no. Sometimes when a woman says no, she means maybe. A woman, yes, but... but this cow... Cow? - You are a very strange man. - Why? You say you hate this princess and yet you name your boat after her. [laughs] Politics, little lady. Politics. I figured when the princess saw her name on my boat, she'd be flattered. - So? - Yep. Hand a woman a little flattery and you can get anything you want. - Anything? - Mm-hmm. - What's your name? - Why, uh... Blossom. - Where do you live? - Oh, around here. Shark fishing good business? For male sharks. Valuable for the livers. - Livers? - Kaloe: Yes. Kaloe: Uh, shark liver's a great source of vitamin A. Vitamin A? Yes, energy builder. The white people waste energy making money to buy vitamin A to make more money to buy more vitamin A. Oh, if Princess Tahia would let me fish the reefs around Temple Island, I could be a millionaire. Why not talk to the Princess Tahia yourself? Oh, I can't get near her. But I'll fix her. What are you doing? I'll never see the princess, anyway, so... flattery is out. Gonna take her name off my boat. Kaloe: The big tub of lard! [Kaloe screams] [tropical island music] What's the matter? Kaloe fisherman sad. Kaloe wish to cry? Orano has fine shoulder for weeping. Oh, all my life, I've been a tramp fisherman and it looks like I'll wind up just a tramp. Kaloe should find woman to beat. Sorry for self no good. Man feed on own heart, find poison. - Well, what would you suggest? - Suggest? Stop weeping. Ocean is full of sharks. Kaloe best fisherman. Poof! Easy! Listen, I need supplies to fish and I can't get the credit without the shark livers. And I can't get the shark livers because the princess won't let me fish the channel. Poof! Not so easy. Maybe I can do something. Oh, no. [chuckles] You're a great little guy, Orano. You tried. You know, I fished every coast from here to Australia and right here off this little hunk of island, I find the best shark bonanza in the Pacific. And what happens? One fat, stupid knock-kneed tin goddess says, "Kaloe, go home." You've met Princess Tahia? Met her? You told me yourself not to dock on her beach. Listen, Orano, let this be a lesson to you. Stay away from women who wear mustaches. How you know Tahia like that? Miller. He did everything but draw pictures. [Chuckles] "One look at that dame," he says, "and you're a woman-hater for life." - Miller say that? - Mm-hmm. Why not go see Princess Tahia personal? Wear chest outside. Saw off beard. Big fella say pretty things. Maybe he change her mind. Would she see me? My mother remember Tahia in cradle. - Orano fix it. - When? - You come tomorrow. - I'll be there with bells on. No bells, flowers. Smell nicer. [Kaloe laughs] [serene music] Princess! Suddenly, you roll on the floor like a heathen. It is important. And now you look at yourself in the glass like a cheap Port Coral girl. What is the matter with you? Please. Did someone say you do not look well? Don't be silly. Of course not. Only it is important that a woman doesn't get fat. You see, at this place, a woman should be smaller than... other places. [Tahia laughs] [instrumental music] [natives gleeing] - You come, eh? - Surprise. Only surprise how you look. I know you have much courage, but to wear shoes and have such pain. Kaloe has done something bad, huh? No. [Chuckles] Go back. This is Orano's friend, come for a visit. Good friend. Even if he does wear shoes. Come. My son brings a stranger. The conceited fool. - Is it all set? - Set? Yes. Does the princess expect me? Well, I talked with her long time about you. Yeah? What did she say? When princess talk, she always say plenty. But Orano fix it. And we get the rights to fish? Well, uh... one or two things to settle yet. I fix it, you settle it. Okay? Okay. Hello. Kaloe, this is the most handsome guard on Temple Island. And you most wonderful liar. We come to see Princess Tahia. Does she know this? It is written that princess knows everything. Would you be the one to say it is not so? Come. Kaloe, fella friend, this is Princess Ta... This is... Guard? Take away that wart. Kaloe, I... Princess Tah... [Orano grunts] You know me. ...I... Well? Well, uh, here I am. Why do you invade the privacy of the royal house? I thought Orano... Uh, well, I... I just wanted to have a few words with you. Did you indeed? - Say them. - Uh, yes. I... You have knees? Use them. Of course. - For you, princess. - No weeds. Why, I'm sorry, but... I'm sure it can wait. - It wasn't important anyway. - Stop. Come back. Those who crawl are not yet men. [nervous laugh] That's very good. Heh heh. You know, princess, I'd recognize you anywhere. You look just like I pictured you. Only [chuckles] only more so. Kaloe: I... Blossom: Ooh. Kaloe: [chuckles] I came here as your friend, princess. Blossom: The princess has no men friends. Men are always wanting something. Kaloe: Well, not exactly. - Do you not want something? - Oh, yes, but... What is it you want? - Well, for a long time now... - Yes? Kaloe: Well, you see, I'm interested in fishing and... Fishing? Kaloe: Yes. Get out! Get out, you, you... Oh, oh, princess, I, I must apologize, but I, I met this wench in Port Coral. If she said anything, disregard it. - I am not the... - I am Tahia. You... you're... Then, then this is... Blossom. But with a big personality. What were you doing? Keeping her seat warm? So you're the princess, eh? Yes, the stupid, fat, ugly knock-kneed princess. [laughs] Why do you laugh? Nothing. Nothing. I was just thinking how you looked when that fish hook caught you. A princess on a hook. [Kaloe laughs heartily] It must have been quite a shock to your, to your dignity. [Kaloe cackling] You know something? I've fished through all the islands, but this is the first time I ever caught a princess. [chuckles] And very nice too. [serene music] What are you doing? It is what I have done that matters. You act as though... [chuckles] Now don't tell me you were shocked and wondering if it was the right thing to do. The right thing to do would be this. But I wouldn't mean it. You know, it's funny. Yes? Ten minutes ago, I was nothing but a tramp fisherman. Now I've got one of the best shark channels in the Pacific. That's what you had on your mind all the time. Oh, no. I, I just happened to be thinking that... That you could get what you want with a few kisses? - Get out. - But, Tahia... You are too free with your love, my fine fisherman. Well, you weren't so tight yourself. Get out! Go back to Port Coral. That's where you belong. - But, princess, I... - Out! Get out! But, princess, I... I need... Some vitamin A. That's what you need. [instrumental music] And the minute I mentioned fish, she said no. Wong surprised you not use kissing routine. That's just what I did. My best brand too. [Chuckles] But the only thing I left out was... Hey, how did you know? Wong very bright in love matters. Well, Wong... without those fishing rights, I'm washed up. You do not come here only to make farewell. No, not exactly. I... And lending money only draw interest of pain. - Oh, but, Wong, listen... - Wong know. If I am smart man, I will invest in Kaloe's shark business. Yeah, and we'll split 50-50. Wong also very bright in arithmetic. Fifty percent of nothing leave nothing. - Oh, but, Wong. - No deal. Well, I guess you're right. I am a bad investment. Well, thanks, anyway. Wong: Kaloe. I need about $1,500. That will make a payment on a bigger boat, supplies, bait, a new start. Wong have extreme hard head. That good. But he also have soft heart. That very bad. - You mean I get the money? - Hmm. Good. I'll... I'll start the first thing in the morning. They tell me there's a couple of islands off the Indies where the sharks are all males, with livers the fifth of their weight. Fifteen hundred dollar. Oh, you're a swell guy. Please, spend wisely. [tropical island music] Kaloe, fella Wong say Kaloe leave for some place far off. That's right. First thing in the morning. What's the matter? Kaloe got big anger? Maybe Orano fix you to meet fella princess again. You're a great little fixer, my friend. The last time, you fixed me for good. [speaking native language] Tahia plenty pretty. - Also much excited. - And how? Nice for kissing job, no? Yeah, if you like hot peppers every meal. - You go away positively? - Yep. Orano lose new friend. [chuckles] That goes for me, too, funny face. We'd have made great partners. I have gift for departing friend. Please do not open till you leave. Sure, and... and thanks, Orano. It will remind you of us, and maybe perhaps make you come back. [intense music] [intense music] Kaloe: Hey! [Grunts] [grunting] [speaking native language] [engine starts] When you get around to it, let me know what this is all about. It is about something even lower than a shark hunter. A thief. Thief? Are you telling me I stole that? And on this island the penalty for stealing... If this is a joke, I think it's gone far enough. I haven't the time to go around stealing trinkets. Trinkets! [dramatic music] Take it easy, boys. Take it easy. We're all going the same way. Come on, you! Orano: Ow! Ow! [Orano yelping] You may go now. This may develop into a private matter. Orano: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh! [speaking native language] Orano, didn't you give this to me in Port Coral? Did you not come to me and say that the shark fisherman stole this? Did you give this to him? Did you? I... it seems to me that I gave Kaloe fella something. Orano: I do not remember. My head does not work well. It is some kind of a mistake. Tahia begs you to forgive. I think I shall speak to Orano for a few moments. Oh, oh! Ah! No! Oh! Oh! Kaloe! I didn't mean it! I didn't mean it! I didn't, I didn't mean it! Please don't beat me! Ah! Don't beat me! Orano: Somebody help me! Ow! Ow! Ow! This time you fixed it good. - Owl! - Enough? You'll never lie to the princess again? Never! [softly] Thanks. Oh, [chuckles] uh, pardon the interruption. You know, I... I can understand your being worried about that. You must think Tahia silly to run after this old incense burner. Well, it certainly looks valuable enough. Only to us. It has seen the prayers in my family for many, many years. Sort of a sacred heirloom, eh? Very sacred. In it lies our history. Come, I will show you. [sighs] [dramatic music] [traditional music] He is a fierce God, this one. He is Tangaroa. God of the sea. He gives us our food and the rains. It sparkles like gold. What would you do if you saw gold spread out as big as this pool with jewels, big jewels? [dramatic music] Pretty stones, no? Pretty stones, yes. - Nice to look at? - Nice to have. Have? Tahia, do you know what those stones and bricks are? Bottom of pool. Some men would do anything for the bottom of that pool. - And you? - No, thanks. I'll just stick to my shark fishing. But I'm beginning to understand a few things about Miller. I thought he had eyes only for you, but I think he might find this more than just nice to look at. Tahia, aren't you afraid that... That he might take them? No one could while Tangaroa watches. Tahia was wrong. Kaloe does not need vitamin A. Well, Mr. Miller, I have a long way to go yet. Oh, you shouldn't worry about that, son. Sit down. I thought you promised that no strangers would visit your island. I tried my best. Obviously, your best isn't good enough. A stranger, a fisherman spent considerable time over there today. A fisherman? That is an easy matter. I can handle that. Tamara, it seems that your life is made up of easy matters. I don't know what I'm gonna do with you. I know. Prison. Debtor's prison. Prison? Why? IOUs, $1,270 worth. Tsk, tsk, tsk. That's a lot of money. - I'll pay it back. - How? Next time when I win. This is a cash-and-carry business, son. I don't mind extending credit... If you had a little something to show for it. Yes, that's right. If you had a little something to show for it. Show! Show! What do you want me to show? Now, now, take it easy. Don't get excited. Some people pay their debts with valuables, jewels. I have no valuables! Some natives work their bills off. Others are lucky. They have land. - I have land. - Every native says that. But I have. I can prove it. In native writing, my father's deed. It's a wise son that knows his father's deeds. [Chuckles] Can I get more credit if I bring that deed? You bring the deed in, you'll get more credit. And your IOUs. [tropical island music] It is nice to find Her Highness at home. Tamara! - Where have you been? - Where have you been? It is private with me. It is disgraceful with you. You with that foul shark hunter. In Port Coral, they say he's a tramp. And now this tramp comes here to dine with you. You, the princess. I am the princess, and I do as I please. Alright, then I do as I please. If that means drinking and gambling, I say no. Look at you. A bad example of a native, and a poor imitation of a white man. Soon your own people won't like you, and the white man won't have you. No worse than you. Behaving like a cheap native woman, making love to a tramp with fish scales on his hands. What did he promise you? A string of beads? Forgive Tahia, brother. There's a gentleman to... to speak to the princess. Erik: Hello, princess. Are you surprised? I got a little present for you. Why did you bring me this? Well, I figured a lady ought to have a watch. It tells you when to do things. Did Mr. Miller send you here? Well, you see, queenie, me and him is partners. And wanting to do me partner a little favor, I thought I'd find out if you're worthy of him. Do you know what my people will do to you if they find you here? [dramatic music] Mr. Miller! Get out. If you touch her again, I'll kill you. Princess Tahia, I apologize for that fool. - But you sent him. - I? I send another man to you? Then I don't understand. You remember a long time ago, a stranger, a white man came here. He took you sailing in his boat. You remember that? When he came back to Port Coral, I killed him. I killed a man because he dared to come here. Tahia... I've waited years to tell you this. There's been no one else since that day I first met you. All I ask is to be near you. If you were to be my wife, I would make a princess of you the whole world would admire. Nothing would be beyond your reach. I am sorry, but... Kaloe. Kaloe. [Sobs] Tamara: I see. Wong: Hill too steep. Chris: I'm out. Miller: Two pair. That's no good. I've got three jacks. I was about to say two pair of kings. Your sister know you risk valuable deed to Temple Island for credit? After all, you... After all, Tamara is no longer a child. That's right. Some more chips, please. That will make 2,000 in your deed. I'd better get Tamara out of there. Kaloe better guard self. Oh, don't worry, funny face. I know how to handle sharks. [piano music] - What do you want? - I wanna see Tamara. - He isn't here. - You're lying. - Shove off, fisherman. - Ah! Sully: I said he isn't there. Well, if it isn't my old rival, the fish peddler. Okay, Sully. Hello, Tamara. Don't you think it's time you were heading back to the island? I have no desire to speak with spies for my sister. Pull up a chair. Perhaps to a sporting gentleman of your caliber, we may be able to offer some real diversion. - You're very generous. - A fault of mine. Wong: Kaloe. - Chips, my friend? - Kaloe: Fifteen hundred. I know you won't mind, Mr. Miller, but, uh, how about a nice new deck? Sully. You boys want anything to eat? Bring a fresh deck of cards, will you, Sully? And get a double decker sandwich for me. Sure you won't have anything? Okay, Sully. Thanks, Sully. [shuffles card] I'll open. 500 on my deed. I'll see it. This hand have bad taste in mouth. I drop. I'm afraid I'll have to stay... and raise you 500. I will just see that raise. I'm in. How many cards will you have, Tamara? I have plenty. No more cards. Sounds strong. You, my romantic friend? I can use about two cards. Perhaps I can fix you up with a lovely dark lady. That would make you quite a fixer. I'll have one myself. Opener bets. Five hundred more out of my deed. I'll see it. I'm afraid you gentlemen are, shall I say, a trifle timid? I'll raise a thousand. I will see that raise, and raise another thousand. In American baseball, they call this a squeeze play. That will cost you 2,000 to stay. I'll need another 1,600, Wong. Now, now, remember your investment. - May peek? - No. For $1,600, not even one peek? No. What do you wanna do? Jinx the hand? Have patience, Wong. Patience fine, courage very sick. Suppose we raise once more just to make certain, eh, my boy? - Another thousand? - That's right. I... I will just see that raise. This isn't the time to stop. Let's see how strong Mr. Miller really is. I'll raise 2,000. Eh, Wong? That just completes the credit in Tamara's deed. I'll see you. You are no gentleman. Tamara will stay. Come to think of it, this is the most appetizing sandwich I've ever seen. I know you don't mind, Mr. Miller. What have you, Tamara? Full house, sevens and threes. That's too bad. Four queens. And I think Mr. Miller was bluffing. Will you cash these chips, please? Part of that deed is mine. Tamara owes me 2,000 in it. Well, take it out. And I'll have his IOUs. - May I buy the deed from you? - It's not for sale. [groans] Excuse, please. Uh, investment safe. Business call me. This sandwich had poison in it, Sam. [drumbeats] [girls laughing] [gong clanging] [horn blowing] [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] Oh, I love this feast day. Why not? Today we choose husbands. [laughing] - Of our own island. - Yes. Princess Tahia is only one to go from Temple Island for husband. Nothing but harm come of one who live with sharks. [drumbeats] [traditional music] [music continues] [music continues] [speaking native language] Forgive me for interrupting, princess. I know how much this day means to you and to your people. Then why do you interrupt? Erik! Chris! Tamara. We found him on the beach at Port Coral. But why? Tamara never did any harm. Erik: Well, maybe not intentionally, Your Highness. But if a couple of hot-headed young men get into an argument and one of them gets mad enough, he's pretty close to murder. Stop talking in riddles. If you have anything to say, say it. Well, Kaloe and Tamara was gambling last night. What of it? Well, Kaloe won some sort of a paper from Tamara. Oh, there was quite a bit of an argument about it. And then just before Tamara left, he hit Kaloe in the face. Well, naturally, Kaloe... Erik has a suspicious mind. Princess, I know how much your brother meant to you. He also meant a great deal to me. If you'll only turn this over to us, we'll find the murderer. - And when we do... - Orano: Kaloe! Your knife! [dramatic music] You're sure? Sure, that's my knife. But, princess, I... Kaloe, the truth. Yes, sharker, what about it? Well, Orano was with me. He knows I didn't do it. Go on, tell them, Orano. Orano, one already lies dead. What you say may Kill another. Kaloe did not do this! I know. We went together to find Tamara. I don't like to believe this, princess. I don't doubt the boy, but if this is really Kaloe's knife... But I was with Kaloe friend! Were you with him all the time? We went to your place. - And you saw Kaloe play cards? - No. Then you weren't there when he left with Tamara. - No, but... - He met you at his boat later? No. I came back in canoe. Then how does the boy know what happened after he left? Don't know. You're the law in this case, princess. Just say the word and we'll... It is for my people to deliver justice. [dramatic music] - Is there anything I can do? - Please go. But you may need someone here, princess. Please. [mellow music] [sobbing] [intense music] [growling] [growling] [instrumental music] Kaloe! Kaloe! [growling] [dramatic music] [growling] [growling] Thanks, funny face. You shouldn't have done this. If they ever found out you helped me... Don't worry about Orano. He can always fix things... sometimes. [chuckles] You are most unhappy investment. I'm sorry, Wong. Tell me, that deed I gave you, was it transferred? - As you request. - And the date registered? - As required by law. - Good. May I have it back now? Thanks. Now I need some legal advice. Most happy. Be seated, please. Wong now ready. Will this notarized deed prove I had no intentions of grabbing the island? Deed now registered in name of Princess Tahia. Good. Now I've got to find out if it was Miller or one of his men who killed Tamara. By circumstantial evidence, you are in need of clever detective. This way. Professional detective desk. Case call for special powers of deduction. Now, which one would Kill harmless boy? I'm sure for a few extra dollars, any one of his men wouldn't hesitate. And I don't believe killing is beyond Miller himself. - Don't believe he would. - Of course, he would. What a fool I was not to have thought of it. He'd do anything to get back at the princess. Please to take time. Deduction, simple. Prove, more difficult. - What are you getting at? - Mr. Miller very smart man. Not likely soil own hands with crime. You think it was a paid killer? Have in mind such copyrighted cutthroat. Just tell me where I can find him. Please have patience. Pretty soon, maybe he come right here to Wong's office. Here? Are you a magician too? Not enough desks. Believe killer come to collect money I keep for him in safe. Think he plan to leave Port Coral quick. - Very secret. - What's his name? When called, man answer to name... [knock on door] [intense music] Wong: Who, please? Chris: Open up, Wong. Chris: Got my cash? Wong: Uh, one moment, please. Wong: I have key to safe in desk. - Why, you, I ought to slap... - Sit down! Sit down or you will receive physical collapse. Kaloe. What's this all about? You not such bright young man. Where you get so much money? Did Miller pay you? - Pay me for what? - Kaloe: For killing Tamara. You're both crazy. Why you leave Port Coral in such a hurry? You afraid somebody ask question? - You got nothin' on me. - Stay where you are. Kaloe: You killed that boy, last night, with my knife. [chuckles] Very nice plan, my friends. Very nice. But just try and prove it. I'm going to prove it right now. Give me that gun. Do I get the truth? You won't shoot. Anyways, I'm bright enough to know a dead witness won't help you none. Why don't you shoot? [door opens] Chris: What are you doing here? What's he doing here? He's dead. No one here but Wong and Kaloe. You nervous? Want drink? I don't want nothing but to get that dead man out of here! There is no dead man here. There is. There is. He's right there! I know! He's dead! I killed him! I threw the knife, but it was Miller's idea. It was! He paid me! I thought so. Sign, please. You might save own neck if you sign confession. It was Wong's idea. Little Chinese Theater. Wong, stage manager, lawyer, detective. Total fee, $6, please. [intense music] [knocks on door] - Miller: Who is it? - Erik. - Miller: What do you want now? - You! One of these days, you'll learn a little respect. You know, I'm just beginning to find out there's a few things about you I don't like. Something in your craw, my friend? Yes. For one thing, your methods. [laughs] That might lead to a very interesting discussion at some other time. It's rather early in the morning for that, you know. Some other time may be too late. You've bungled it, my friend. You're not only left with an empty bag, we're in it. Never mind the cleverness. What are you trying to say? - Chris. - What about him? He's on his way to America by now. You think so, eh? He's sittin' over in jail. - Jail? - Yes, waiting trial for murder. There's another way of stopping him from talking. Well, there's not much point in killin' him now. He's already signed a confession. Wong and the fisherman tricked him. You and your stinkin' brain. First, you make a play for the lady, but she happens to have other ideas.

Why don't you sit down and write the Princess Tahia a lovely little note and say, "Dear princess, please, can I have the jewels and gold at the bottom of your pool?" Why, Sam? I know what this is all about. Now then, let's both get busy. [dramatic music] Cover us from the top of the steps. What do you want? Why do you come to the sacred pool? [gunshot] Make it quick. [dramatic music] Orano: Kaloe! Kaloe! Glad Kaloe is here. Temple Island have many visitors. Mr. Miller and many men have come to sacred pool. Sacred pool! Princess, you better warn your people. Wong, you go with her. Mr. Miller use language of force. Good, that's the way he'll get his answer. Come on, Orano. Tahia: Arm yourselves! [intense music] Arm yourselves! [shouting in native language] [clamor] Stop! Don't move! [dramatic music] Watch out, boys. Orano: They're blowing up the pool! [intense music] [gunshot] [explosion] [rumbling] Kaloe! Look out! [dramatic music] [rumbling] It's Tangaroa. He's angry. Earthquake. Foolish Miller. You see? Tangaroa was watching. [serene music] [goats bleating] [goat bleats] See, I fix it. [music continues]
