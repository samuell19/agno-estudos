It started with the school sport stars. Nobody could wake them up. And nobody could explain it. If they had asked me, well... Uh, they wouldn't. I'm a loser. Oi! Let's leave it there. And these... Are my loser friends... We're invisible. Mostly. Hello. Ha, ha, ha. Hello. My name is Kiera. This is my school... Or what's left of it. How long has this been going on? Couple of months? Years? Who's counting? Well, it's very good of you to keep quiet about it. My mother always used to say: 'A problem buried is a problem halved.' I told you about it last term And the term before that, and the term before that... My mother always used to say: 'A problem buried is a problem halved.' Okay Dickhead Look, I would help you, but... I'm fighting fires up to me eyeballs at the minute. Can't you just lay this to rest? I think so. The doctors are calling it CUMS. Cataclysmic unrelenting moribund sleep. Which I know doesn't sound fantastic. Does that mean they are never waking up again? Dreamy Jarrold. Baby, ohhhh baby You drive me crazy Oh baby Baby. Guys? Anyone ever tell you...you have a tiny... Vocal range? What? Imagine calling your son... Jarrold. Or Len. Norman. Or tonight's target... Connor. I know what you're doing. Fuck. What? I said I know what you're doing. I'm not. It's... You're trying to avoid talking to me. I know I said it couldn't work but... I'm having second thoughts. Well, have third ones. You were right, Connor we're from different planets. I don't think your friends would appreciate Fuck my friends! I'll leave them. I'll leave all of them for you. I could join a capella club I've always wanted to sing. I have a mean falsetto. There's a lot more to a capella club than that, Connor. Make space! Make space! Come here! Give him space! I just don't want either of us getting hurt. And I... Kids are dropping like flies. And we could be next. I just wanna spend my final moments with someone I... Just don't... They're coming to mine tonight. I'll leave the squash squad. So um... I think I may be no good, but... I wanna give singing a shot. You know I... I go home and I... Like, cry myself to sleep every night. I mean...am I happy? No absolutely not. I think I like Kiera. Do you not like me? Fuck, fuck, fuck, shit Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Um... That's her, she's um... I think you'd better leave. He must be out. I left the others at the wrong house. I went to go find him myself. I'm not going anywhere. Well... Kiera! Kiera! You'll always be one of us! Connor! You'll always be one of us! Welcome, students, to another glorious day. Um... Sun...shining...breeze. Ohhh...damn it. To tell the truth, I'm this close to giving up. My name is Kiera. This... ... is my school. You see me now. Don't you? Hello? Hey. This... This was you? Goodbye, Connor. I can explain. Kiera I don't know what you think you saw. It wasn't me Under the sheets. Kiera If there's one thing I know for sure... This is my thing. I wanna sing. Kiera! If there's one thing I know for sure... I love you.
