IT HAPPENED IN SAINT TROPEZ Grandpa will be so glad to see you. How is he? Physically, fine. His memory is not. Where does this go? Champagne over there. Gifts and flowers that way, in the dining room. Sorry, Noga. So your parents are coming? They're in NYC. You know Dad. Always complicated. See you Saturday at City Hall. Hey, is Uncle Zef coming? Always complicated. Please, Dad. Make an effort. Anyway, Mom won't say it but she's dying to go to the wedding. Call you after rehearsal. No, Irène! We won't go to that wedding. I missed my cue. I'm sorry. You did fine, Daniel. Crap! He missed his cue. Tell him! You're reassuring him! You were crap. Be a tiny bit indulgent. For once! You can't be both indulgent and demanding. I know, I know. Darling, they need you for the pictures! The party in Cannes! The title was to be "Heiress". I told you, I don't like the word. All about death, and money. Also passing something on. The title will be: "Melita, Roni Melko's Loveliest Diamond "Finally Wears A Ring!" Where's the band already? My grandfather a watchmaker, my father a jeweler. - My mother... - Queen! Right, beauty queen! San Remo... Forget the year! Queen, so my daughter a princess. - Lipstick? - Of course not! Oh Roni! Ah, Irène. Finally. How are you? No, Zef isn't with me. I know, we'd have loved to. We play Philly Tuesday. Booked it 2 years ago. What a shame. You'll be missed. They're not coming. We checked the flights, but it's cutting it too close. Tell Melita how sorry we are. We're so disappointed. Goodbye, Irène. You're now Melko Jewelry's ambassador. I am Artistic Director for the accessories division. My father "democratized" the diamond... Dad! Not now, please. He missed his calling. To hear him whine Sinatra songs off-key, once again? No way! Your poor dad. A family that only gathers for weddings and funerals is dead. Exactly. Now we're skipping weddings. Your father's not young. Maybe... You really checked the flights? I never change my mind! I know, I know. Where's that deli? No kosher food in B'klyn? Noga adores her cousin. She'll go. She's a grown-up. If it was up to me, believe me! - A Saturday! - It's not a religious wedding. I'll say! - No priest at least. - Not her fault she's Italian. Italian's not her fault, but to be that stupid... "Tolstoyefsky!" I'll never forget that one! If we flew out on Thursday, arriving Friday... Stop, Irène. Go get me a sandwich. Quit bugging me with that. - Nice and hot! The pastrami! - I know! Irène! The bread, too! Nice and hot! Yes. It's all set, Rabbi. 4 PM. Or 4:15 at the cemetery. 15 mins. either way. Shabbat? Yes, I know it's Friday. Excuse me? "To get home for Shabbat." I told you, I'm not practicing at all. So you know, Shabbat... Oh you! Right, of course. Sorry. Monday?! That would be hell! Because... Listen, Rabbi, my daughter's wedding is tomorrow. 300 guests! My brother's arriving now from NYC. He's very... I mean, he's a very religious person. Very complicated. Very... respectful of tradition. We can't mix everything up. No, we must get rid of... I mean, get this over with... I mean this ceremony must take place today. Thanks, Rabbi. I'll be in Paris at 3 PM. You OK? Not tired? I'm fine. I'm holding up. It hasn't really sunk in. Well, I'll meet you at the station. The ferry in Croatia? Yeah, I sort of heard. Thirty-two coffins! Listen closely, Mr. Delbar. You're respectable, you buried my mother. You'll bury my father, my wife, tutti quanti. Now make sure that coffin is at Montparnasse by 4 on the dot! Tomorrow's out! One, it's Shabbat. Two, it's my daughter's wedding. Can't have a party with a warm corpse between Brooklyn and Montparnasse! It's bad taste. Where are you? Wait, I'm coming. All this over a pastrami sandwich. Don't feel guilty, don't feel guilty. Well... - No bags? - I leave tomorrow. I didn't cancel Philly. She wouldn't want me to. Are we ready? The rabbi? All good! Just clear her through customs... Clear the coffin. A formality. It'll be quick, very quick. You seem really upset. - This gets me... - You know, I... I'm very touched. And Dad? Rough. Goes off the rails. No restraint, clueless. Then sometimes, he's like before. Physically? Physically... he's still the same. What about the coffin? I won't leave her alone. Noga gets in at 3. The funeral home is tops. They got it. Because I won't leave her alone. Not one second. I'll stay with her, OK? I'll go to customs. Take my driver. Get Noga, we'll meet at the cemetery. - What's the coffin like? - Mahogany. I chose the best. - Why do you ask? - No reason. You'll stay with us? Although, with the wedding... I got a room at the Hotel Aïda. Fine! Your kosher hotel. Go ahead, I'll manage. Are you sure? I won't leave her side. Antoine, stay with my brother. Want to freshen up? Shave? I can't shave, for heaven's sake. Not for a month. Excuse me. To the Gare du Nord. 4 PM at the cemetery. That one, too. For City Hall. - Perfect, right? - A little sugar-coated. Sizes 8 and 12. 3,800? For a funeral. That's insane! And this one? 4,900. Because of the embroidery. - That one you could wear again. - Right! Versailles, the cancer thing. Not the same people. Do I have to go to the cemetery? I have to do the seating! - Excuse me. - Go right ahead. My love! I wanted to ask you... A coffin jam, you believe it? Could take hours! We have to finish by 4, because Shabbat... Can't we move Shabbat back an hour, for once? Don't talk nonsense. Sundown is at 6:51, end of story. They've cleared 13. 19 more to go. All seniors, poor devils. In Croatia, I know. It's up to the D.I.C.E. Roll of the dice? Dept. of Inspection and Customs Entry. Here. Mrs. Irène Melkowitch. She must be buried today at 4. - Bury her tomorrow. - We can't tomorrow. That's her! What? Lunch break. On the Eurostar. It sure is a bad time. I was so happy to come, but now... I'm so sad, I'd drag the whole wedding down with me. I don't want a change, Melita. Not right away. I'm leaving tomorrow with my Dad. I'm filling in for Mom. I can't leave him alone. Not yet. He's lost without her. All right. See you at the cemetery. I can't wait to see you either. Big, big hug. Those are my last. You're French? It's good to cry. My mother died. Two days ago. When my father died, I... Anyway, I just mean, it's good to cry. A love letter? I really suck at this. Can I help you? Have you received many? Written many? I've read many. Especially poems. Aragon, Éluard... Google "I Love You," Paul Éluard. Yes, Dad. He came to pick you up? That's nice. Yes it is, it's nice. Yes, right. 3PM. OK, see you later. I love you for all the women I've never known, I love you for climes where I've never grown. For the scent of open sea and the scent of warm bread, For the melting snow and first flowers. It's so beautiful. I shouldn't have read that. What can you write after that? - Plagiarism isn't pretty. - Better than sucking! Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Paris. In a few moments we will arrive at Gare du Nord, last stop. Let me do it. There is also: I love you, I'm suffocating I can bear it no longer. Your face is in my heart, for all eternity. Cyrano. Aron Melkowitch. - Pleasure. - Dad! Roni! Hurry up, where's your school bag? I'm Zef. Zef, Dad. Here, put this on. Uncle Zef, it's so sad. Hello, grandfather. - Surélé! - Forget it. How pretty! Is it so hard to shave? Sir, I'm Haïm Isenberg. Where is..? Exactly, they're not here. I live in Puteaux, it's 4:30. Haïm! Heard the one about Jacob and Moshe? Oh shit, I know this one. This is bad. He's old, be indulgent. Dad, we're at the cemetery. No, let him finish. So Jacob says, "My friend, you are mistaken!" But Moshe won't let it go. "You're mistaken!" "Those are my balls you're scratching!" Funny, right? Yes, Dad. It is funny. It is. All good! Right on time. Did someone die? Yes Grandpa. Mom died. Mom? You remember my mom. Irène. Irène! Yes, Surélé and I had such a laugh! Which daughter-in-law do you prefer? "Stupid" or "Ugly"?! What the hell? A symbol. I don't know. You share my grief. You share my grief. Not really! I hardly knew her! The synagogue is after? No, a synagogue is a place for life, not for death. Oh really? That is good news. An American size. Sorry, it's a non-standard coffin. - American? - Everything's bigger there! Can't we cut it down? No? I don't know. Plane it. Just a few inches. Need to change coffins. - No problem. Wake her. - Yes! Problem! Let's change coffins now. We'll have the ceremony Monday. He's going to bust our balls! I know it. 2 days away. Fucking pastrami sandwich! - Noga! - Delbar! Where's my list? My seating plan! Mrs. Rosenfeld is coming to pick up her watch. The watch is a fucking goner! Voice mail! Mr. Delbar? Roni Melko. I hope you're on top of this. Total secrecy until Monday! Given that... well, you know. Call me back when you get this. Dad! You go with Melita. Take Grandpa to his workshop. Tomorrow we celebrate. You honeymoon. We'll bury that hag Monday! I'll wear an old dress. Delbar! Mr. Delbar, where are you? What do you mean, my house? Is there an air-conditioned room? You can't open it. Roni, the Almighty has given me a last weekend with her. Hang on. Let's work this out. Honestly, this... A "discharge zone". Can you imagine? Put her in a discharge zone! It's an expression. No, that's the correct term. Or "depository". But I like that less. What are you doing? Covering the mirrors. Traditional, when there's a death. Careful not to scratch the table. The ice. My Irène. My darling, I won't leave you. Not one second. She looks asleep. The ice. Uncle Roni, we'll close the door, no one will see us. OK, Dad? We won't tell anyone. We'll be here... Pardon me. We'll be here Monday at 7 AM sharp. At 7? That's very early, isn't it? Yes, it is early. I wish you every happiness, Miss. You've never been to my place. I've had it 2 years. Tonight, Sam and I agreed, no contact. No calls. As if the dress were really white. - Want to see it? - That's bad luck! Who cares? You won't see it tomorrow. Wow! You're beautiful. At 12, already, you were built like a super-model. So, Sam? I had this thing with a surfer. An American, you never met. Sam did an internship at Melko. Played it tough. Almost hostile. The inner-city kid dissing the boss' daughter. Pissed me off. I asked him to drive me to Louise's, in Fontainebleau. I put sugar in the engine. We broke down, in the woods. I was all over him. Now he's the company CFO. Sleep with the boss' daughter, speeds things up! He is bright. Degrees in everything. The day Lélé almost fell into the Grand Canal. We were trashed on Chianti. You ate ham. And shrimp! My parents never knew. Hungry? Come on. You still eat kosher? Not since Venice. Dad yelled, Mom calmed him down. I avoid pork. Drives him nuts. What a ballbuster he is! I burned myself! I'm exhausted. I sent everyone home. Big mistake! What's that? It's for your father. Hard-boiled egg in hot water. I had gnocchi, but... It's traditional, after a funeral. Thank you. I'm famished. They had no kosher meals on the plane. Is this enough? I have gnocchi alla Romana. Where I come from, when we're sad, there are flowers... We eat good things. Pasta, salami... Sorry. Salami, I know. The Bible and everything, I'm not very... But I saw The Ten Commandments. I'll never forget the lepers. - Was the silver..? - Still hot. That was Ben-Hur. The lepers. It wasn't Moses? But it was Charlton Heston, right? Zef. Dad wants you. I promised you'd come up. I don't want... Giovanna, could you stay please? - Me? - Thank you. I don't want to leave her alone. Not one second. I'd like to be you sometimes. It's hard for me to let go. I always feel guilty. Even today. Sad... Want some? But why guilty? I'm eating gnocchi. He's got an egg, at Mom's side. Also because... I'm pissed off I can't go to your wedding. No, I can't even say it. Yes you can! I met a guy on the train. I keep thinking about him. I'm madly in love. Fantastic! I was shaking all over, crying, mumbling. Kept staring at his eyes. - Oh, those eyes! - He hit on you? He gave me a kleenex. I was sniffling like crazy. - I kept it! - Did you talk? I did something pathetic. You'd have the guts. Well thank you. I cornered him, I kissed him. He didn't move. So humiliated! Will you see him again? - I'll never forget him. - Trains, what a fantasy! I'd have taken him by the hand, to the toilet, fucked him good. No words! Goodbye, sir. Goodbye Ma'am. And off to get married! What's this for? A DNA test? We're closed! Come back tomorrow morning at 9. It's Zef, Dad. It can't be. The violinist? The famous violinist?! So now you're single. No. I'm a widower, Dad. Comes to the same thing, right? - In my head, no. - What head? I'm talking... It's late. Melita's wedding is tomorrow. That's good. I like her fiancé. Sam. So do I. Yeah, but I mean "Sam"... Samuel or Samir? Yes, actually? Come on, give me a break! You know, children, I've forgotten nothing. Nothing. It's all up here. In my head. You... You're vanilla. And you... You're pistachio. Pistachio! Your arguments, rue des Haudriettes... Something else! And the day you broke the Louis XV clock, belonging to Mrs. Stein, one of my biggest customers. And Surélé was worried sick when you went to prison. Who, me? No. I've never been to prison. That's all old news, Dad. I'm old news, too. Leave me alone. But... Your mother does not change. Those wonderful little tits. Her little butt... so perky. Stop it, Dad. That little butt... - Round and... - Stop, Dad! What, stop? I'm speaking of my wife! So tell me, New York... Not sick of it? I live here in Paris, with you, Dad. - Zef lives in New York. - Oh really? Your wife was in good health! Curvaceous! Voluptuous. A bombshell. Like Lollobrigida! Remember Gina Lollobrigida? As a boy, I fantasized about her all the time! We're talking about Zef's wife. Irène. Zef's wife, who just... Irène? I'm all mixed up! Irène? That ironing board? That ballbreaker. She converted you! I didn't convert. I'm practicing. Practicing. We didn't bring you up that way. I don't get it. What happened to you? - She drove you away from us. - No, not at all! We made choices. Together. Together, we learned values. The Almighty guided us to... Tell the Almighty to do His business in Somalia! Let them taste His gefilte fish, they won't want to eat anymore. He's not laughing. He doesn't find it funny. Kids, it's getting late. Go to bed. It's a school night. Good night. He's really very far gone. Think so? Not so bad tonight. That set-up is a little strange. Set-up? That reconstructed workshop. It feels like a 40s movie. Makes him happy. Think so? What would you do? Sell it all? Put him in a home? Visit when you fly in for a concert? OK. Thanks for taking care of him. I know. Not easy, with your life. Leave my life out of it. Go pray, I'm going to sleep. I'll get you a sweater. You'll freeze to death with this. Don't forget to put out the candles. I can't put out the candles. It's Shabbat. Surélé?! I promised I would take you to Maxim's. I saved my money. 100 francs a month, for two years! Grandpa, let's go. Go where? - To Maxim's! - Oh, fine. Very pretty, all of it. Melita, my jewel, my love, my one and only daughter, unique in every way... Thanks to you, now I have the son Giovanna and I always dreamed of. Welcome, Sam. Welcome to the Melko company, to our home, our family, and especially... to our hearts! I really sweat it out. To find words for Melita. Wondrous, unexpected words to express my love for her. And my joy at being adopted by this family, so generous, luminous, shining... I don't mean diamonds. I went on the net. There's a site for declarations. Yes, very uncool. I was a little ashamed. I read poems. I was discouraged. So I asked someone for advice. My friend Cyrano. On his cell. He's under the table. One second, excuse me. Yes, Cyrano? All right. Yes, fine. So here goes, Melita. Melita, I love you. I can bear it no longer. I'm suffocating. Your face is in my heart, for all eternity. Where are you going? Antwerp! I have a 5:10 train. She's waiting. Who is? Patricia. Patricia Karlim. Come along? All right. We'll get the 7:15 train. Come, it's better. - The champagne! I need to pee! - One second! Stop. How beautiful! She is beautiful. Mazel tov, darling. Come, Dad. I wish you all the happiness in the world. I'm ashamed to be so happy. Where have you been? Someone there? What's the matter? I'm ashamed to be so happy. Kiss me. - It's over? - Don't worry, Uncle Roni. - We were 5 mins. behind. - A stop at an antique shop! - She's the antique. - Stop it, Dad. Say that again. Drop it. You invade my house, my daughter's wedding, with all your undertakers, coffins and dry ice. Never wonder if you put us out? Those your values? Your sharing? Did the Almighty teach you to say thank you? I respect your choices. Respect my grief. What do you respect? Oh, right! Your music. Perfect alibi. Serious music. And religion. Beautiful religion and music. Besides concerts and lectures, what do you give? To whom?! Summer, one year later Did you land yet? We're leaving tonight but not without you! Hurry up! - Where to? - Saint Tropez. Took me 3 hours yesterday. Hurry, girls! They're coming soon! What a shopping spree! Sure about the gladiolas? I love gladiolas. Tell them in Zimbabwe, platinum's 10 points less! Your husband. - You can reach him? Where is he? - Traffic. Come in! They're here. Bye, Sam. Shoes! Welcome! The shoes! Shoes. Music! - Yeah? - Porto Cervo! An Avatar party, it'll be great. We leave tonight after the party. A nightmare. New York yesterday, Berlin this morning. I'm wiped. Last thing I want is a night with bozos painted blue. You suck! You're never into anything! Hang on. This is it. I'm coming. Coming... Where are you? The airport. In Nice? No. The airport in... in Berlin. I get in tonight. Pain in the ass! - Bravo. - Thank you. Coming for a bite? - Zef, coming? - I'm going to bed. I'll catch up. Well, did you think it over? - Still too soon. - No! We're waiting. I know musicians. They prefer doubts to admitting their most secret dreams. See you soon. Salzburg! You can't refuse! Tell her! - If she'd rather stay... - With you, you mean! Jerks! New Year's concert. I'd sell my soul! Last year again, on TV, Blue Danube. I wept! Everyone weeps, every year. It's on me! Let's go. I'm in Berlin. All the flights are delayed. - Coming? - Excuse me? We leave early. I don't know, it just says "Delayed". - I'm staying a while. - Really? I need to think it all over. I'm waiting. See you later, I mean it. Yes, sir? Leave without me. What can I say? Melita, enough. I'm screwed, too. I don't want to sleep on a bench in Berlin or be a shmuck in Porto Cervo. I'm not obnoxious. I'm kidding. Forget it. I'll call you back. Are you finished? A sorbet? A Tropézienne? I'll get your change. Excuse me. I'd rather have a glass of Bordeaux and some saucisson. Coming right up. Miss! Your change. Wait! The girl on the train. You! I saw you. Tonight on the cello. That was you. - You're the girl. - I played at the Citadel. Wait! I remember, it was last year. June 19th. The day before my wedding. - You were on the Eurostar. - Maybe. I'm suffocating. I can bear it no longer. It's too much. Your face is in my heart for all eternity. Uncle Zef? Uncle Zef! Dad, it's Zef! I don't believe you! Come on aboard! Come on! Come on! Come aboard! - You here? - We had a concert at the Citadel. Giovanna, look! - How are you? - Fine. - Is Noga here? - Yes, she... Zef, my brother. My friends. - Your shoes. - I'm not staying. Sure you are! Let's call Noga. Met my friend Louise? - Tour of the boat? - It's nice! Did you eat? Have a bite. Although, not simple. Stop in Paris? See Dad? Your shoes please? Last week. He thought I was Vladimir, my piano teacher. He was obnoxious. Go away! Hard-boiled egg, with some hot water? Some tomato juice, thanks. Come. I sort of had a dizzy spell. Total panic. I felt like having no aim, being alone. I'll go then. No, I don't want to be alone anymore! Not at all. Do you often lie? Very little. No, really. Very little. Those German sausages sounded pretty expert. No, the port's that way! You're here? Fantastic! How'd you know? Your dad's here. Come join us! I'm with friends. Bring them along! - That's not easy. - Why? Because he's... He's the director of the Salzburg Philharmonic. We were going out but Sam is stuck in Berlin. Still here tomorrow? I have so much to tell you! How's my dad? They made up. They're up on the bridge, two lovers in the moonlight! Stop, Zef! Our grandparents in Auschwitz! Not here! Not now! Look! The moon, the stars. Listen to the music. The music? Look! The roofs are pink, the girls are pretty! Take a look! It's a party! Just lost my wife, you talk... A year ago, Zef! One year ago. June 17. I remember. Really? The past isn't your thing. True, true. My drive is, the present beats the past. The future may be even better! Ignore the past, no future. What happens when you stop driving? Quit it Zef, give it a rest! Look! The stars... You stop with the parties and the stars! What will you see, looking back? Money? Diamonds? Friends you bought with money? I bet you don't know those pigs sucking your champagne! You're glad I take care of Dad with my money! Everyone's always been glad. Mom, too! Cruises, Venice, trips with the girls! No one sneezed at it. Nearly killed Mom. Her son in jail. She cried every day for a year. 11 months! Will you bust my balls with that forever? In Columbia, I got the idea... For the emeralds? What an idea! An accident! Like penicillin, Roquefort, tarte Tatin. Stop showing off with... How is it again? Oh right, democratizing the diamond! You're actually a great humanitarian. Want to talk accidents? - Why'd your wife die? - Don't. - No. - Oh yes! Because you sent her to fetch a fucking bagel! Pastrami sandwich. She died because she was your slave! She suffered through 3-hour Shabbats. Every Friday, no intermission. You pestered her to the last, you pester us all! Because you're a great artist... You're a dictator. An egomaniac. And a pain in the ass! What will you do when you stop driving? You know... I always think we'll find nothing to say, but that's not true. We find many unpleasant things to say. Mom! We're going out for a cruise. We're going to the Caves! Ciao! Come. It's so beautiful at night. I love my father-in-law. What a fantastic guy. Busted in Columbia with 3 g. of hash, meets a guy in jail with this ugly green good-luck charm. And that gives him the idea. He picked up emerald waste. What they chuck in the trash. And he made "emerald dust". That's how it all started. He... taught me everything, gave me everything. Even his daughter. When my dad died, I wanted to quit school, work, help my mom. As I was only 8... You decided to grow up, marry a girl who's filthy rich. And gorgeous! - "The boss' daughter" is no issue? - Yes, it is. Because I thought I wanted the girl. In fact, I wanted a father. You remember? I remember very well. You've changed. Think so? Are you happy? I have everything I want. Right now I don't know if I want more, or less. A very Talmudic question. Though that word makes the family snigger. Grandpa, religion, the past... He clams up when you broach it. - You broached it? - Tried. Dad scolded me. The only time. Dad never scolds me. - Should he? - No, I'm perfect! His one and only! His jewel. When I hear you and Dad I think I'm lucky to be an only child. Although Noga is really like my sister. But without jealousy, competition... I'm not jealous. I don't mean you. Dad's a big success but he missed his calling. You... He's a crappy singer. We agree about that. A brother is like a mirror. One that magnifies. Doesn't hurt to look now and then. Can I ask a very naive question? Don't take it wrong. I'm ashamed. What's the Talmud? Wow. That would take 2 or 3 thousand years. The short version? I want more, I want less. Your choices, destiny, future... Cooking peas, divine will, plumbing problems. It's all in the Talmud. It's sort of the Bible plus the Yellow Pages. And it's endless. You think you're getting an answer. You find only why you asked. Follow me? Like why those who know you best understand you least. Twenty volumes. Must be in there somewhere. No brothers, no sisters. One cousin whom I adore. She's the sister I never had. Is she beautiful... like you? Much more beautiful. - She can't be. - She is! She's got it all. She's graceful, free... crazy. She goes for it. She dares to do everything I don't. - Her name is... - Look! The boat! They left without me. Regrets? Oh no. My cousin, my family. There are strong ties. Though we see each other rarely. She and I are very different. I must tell you... I don't give a shit about your cousin. If your father and grandfather reject all that, it's because... we all do what we can to protect against memories. But thanks to the laws dictated to Moses on Mt. Sinai, we have remained a people. Those laws are sacred. Though nowadays they may seem trivial, they connect us, throughout the world. We share them... They lead us toward an ideal of purity which we try to pass on to those we love. Noga! Your dad left it on the boat. - Toilet. I don't feel good. - You're pale. Come on. I'm really not well. I couldn't tell him on the phone, in Berlin. I'm so happy. We've been trying for ages. You do have time for coffee? We play in Geneva tonight. They're waiting. As soon as I saw him, I wanted to have his child. You haven't even met! Life is so crazy, no time for anything. I look like an orphan! I work my tail off, too! My signature line: "Meli-Melita". - Like it? - Gorgeous. Selling like crazy! - It's yours. - No way. Oh yes. I'll use that laundry bag. Think it's dry? Unbelievable. Sam! However did he wind up here? I'll be right back. Are Dad and Daniel ready? Haven't seen them. Noga! This is Sam. My cousin, Noga. It's about time. Let's go. We have a plane to catch. We should kiss! We're cousins. Just got in from Berlin. - Where's your bag? - In a café back there. He had to sleep on the beach. Awful night. I can imagine. He's still in shock. Understandable. Oh yes, it's understandable. I told your dad last night. Your dad's great. There he is! Uncle Zef! - I brought your violin. - Thank goodness. This is my husband, Sam. - Hello, Sam. - Hi. - Where were you? - With my cousin. Daniel, Melita. The bus is here. We have to go. When will I see you again? I love my cousin. Autumn Is he conscious? For a week, not a word. No food. Just sleeps. - I hesitated... - It's fine. I cleared my schedule. - Melita? - Great. Five months! Girl or boy? Juliette. I'm guessing a girl. Tell Noga about Dad? Not yet. She's with the Salzburg Philharmonic. - And she's engaged. - Are you glad? He's a musician, he's Jewish, and he loves her. Brace yourself, it's a shock. ...under the covers, shivering. And Jacob says, "You're mistaken!" Moshe insists. "Mistaken!" "Those are my balls you're scratching!" My two sons. Come in. This woman is magical. Magical! My name is Clarisse. I... won't shake. Hello, Ma'am. Miss! Well, Clarisse. You look great. This woman is a wizard! I've come back to life! Clarisse, did you forget me? My back! You scared us. Come here. Come give me a kiss. Are you a nurse? Sophrologist. A little lower, too. There. So you live in New York? Well yeah, his wife died. But he's moving back to Paris. Aren't you? I travel constantly. This is crazy. He's perfect! It happens. Sophrologist. I'm sorry, I... I accompany a being to his deepest recesses. I soothe him, build him up. I apply psycho-corporal method, in an effort to reconcile soul and body. I help them realize how beautiful they are. Look how handsome your dad is! I help patients get in touch with their positive egos. With their deeper resources. For the well-being of seniors. That is admirable. Listen, this geisha has diplomas! Your dad is very receptive. We're going to make great strides together. Receptive. See you soon, Mr. Melkowitch. See you soon. He misses you, you know? Come on. - Wait! - What?! I want to walk. I need to walk! Sit down over here. Your hand. And yours. I'm recharging. The first quartz watches... You're too young. When you didn't wear them close to the skin for a while, they would stop. We're the same way. We're the same way. It has to flow. You must never cut the juice off. Light, energy, heat and love... And when I'm no longer here, it will be like this. Feel it? Is it flowing? Anyway... Oh shit, I forgot. Now I remember. My favorite motto. Forget all that you give. Remember all that you receive. Who said that? Not the Bible! I said it! I fooled you that time! Concert tonight? No, I came to see you. Did he tell you I was dying?! My two sons. Come here. There you go. That Clarisse. Notice anything? No, why? No reason. Winter How was it? Here she is, Zef. The best. Your father. Your grandpa's birthday in April. Dad? Yes, Daniel says I played well. So are you all moved in? Rue de Turenne? Nice neighborhood. April 23rd... I have to check with the orchestra. OK, call you back. Love you. - With the whole family. - Fantastic. April is a long way off, isn't it? Happy New Year. April 23 It'll be just fine. Yes, relax... I can't find it! - Where's my pants? - Be right there. Wait in your room. Don't worry, not a word to your mother. But I mean... Not bad! Buxom! When I get old, I want Alzheimer's. It's great. You forget you're old, forget you're ugly, forget you're sick, forget you're going to die. You'll never be ugly. Not bad for a grandfather. Wait. Not yet. You hate getting old. More than me. If I lose my hair, I'll die! He loves you. Your father. Sure. Since you were born... No. Since Zef was born, you've been wondering. I love you, too. See you there. - You all right? - Fine. He'll be glad to see you. - Come, let's have a drink. - We have time? How is he? For a month, he puts his tux on, takes it off. Puts it on... And you? Set a date yet? Dad, tonight don't make a big deal. It's good news. It's not secret. And you, Zef? Upcoming concerts? Where? You expecting someone? What? It's you, Noga. She's been jumpy for days. Seen Melita? You see them now and then? OK, yes. I'm expecting someone. Someone... I like very much. You see... Here she is! This is Clarisse. Clarisse, this is Noga. And Daniel, my future son-in-law. Thanks to Clarisse, your grandfather is alive. That's overstating it. A kir champagne, for the lady. Are you a doctor? Sophrologist. Well-being for seniors. That exists? Yes. Clarisse works toward... a consciousness in harmony. Balance between body and mind. Excuse me, sir. Could we also have some cucumber and carrots for the gentleman? - I'm allowed! - Right! Clarisse loves life. That's Melita. You never call back. No concert invitations. Your dad moves here, you never come. Sucks! You well? Definitely coming? Very well. Launched my perfume last night. 200 guests at the Ritz. "L'Amoureuse." - Seen the ads? - "L'Amoureuse"? Sam's idea. A poem by... Who wrote it? Shit! Éluard. When did you get in? Where are you? With Dad and a lady who revived Grandpa. Not only Grandpa! - What? You know her? - Notice anything? Sure. She's a bimbo. I have to tell you. I had suspicions in Saint Tropez. - You did? His name's Daniel. The one I saw. When's the wedding? Where? I'll tell you about it. See you later. Later! Your cousin's getting married? It's serious. Not the "on a whim" sort. What sort is she? "Always" and "never". Noga believes in all that. - Nice, right? - Yeah. Nice. - You prefer the other one? - Who? Never mind. Tomorrow he won't even remember who was there. In a tux! It makes him happy. He proposed to my grandmother there. Sorry. It's not you. She's kicking. Hang on. She says... "what a drag to go to Maxim's." Stop making that face. Of course you're part of the family. At least join us for coffee. All right, see you later. That was Louise. I asked her to be godmother. All right? All right? Should I tell you why I really don't want to go? Too much work, too much travel. You're a robot. Don't want to talk, or laugh. Always bored. You know what? You're contagious. I'm bored, too. Where are you? - Daniel. - Hello. Pleasure. Irène! This is Clarisse, Dad. Your fiancé? Congratulations. What did you do to her? Look at this bombshell! Melita says they're on their way. It's so warm. ...for 2 years. 200 francs a month! But tonight we live it up! Champagne, music! That campaign is really absurd. Everyone loves it. Louise loves it. If Louise loves it... If you're just going to scowl... Look at this! Darling. Where is Sam? Sick. Temperature of 102. Wait a minute. What do I do with the ring? The ring I bought at Muller's. Across the street from us. We share everything. Religion, music... Looks like your mother, made over. I'm very happy. No way! Excuse me. - I wanted... - One second! One second. Before she gets here. She doesn't know I did it with little Rivka. Rivka? You slept with Rivka? The Polish girl? The Polish girl. The one who made kreplach better than Mom. And... Not only kreplach! Excuse me. I'd like to announce... some good news. The Bible says to each man his own woman, each woman... Stop it, Dad! Surélé. The love of my life! I saved up for two years! 100 francs per month Maxim's was her dream! Finally! The puffed potatoes! Jealous as a tigress, that Patricia! Wait. Dad, who's Patricia? From Antwerp? - Antwerp? - I'll explain. Must be the music. Brings back so many things! Shut up, Giovanna. Once she scratched me. I had to sneak my shower for a month! I need some air. No. Be right back. Surélé got revenge. Mom got revenge? She sure did! With Vladimir. That killed me. My piano teacher? Why do you think I got you a violin? I told you all. About my wife, my family! More like your family! I tried to tell you that night. You trapped me! You knew! You just let me. What a jerk! When did you know? Right, I let you! What a laugh! The existential crisis! I wanted the father, the daughter! Must work on some girls. Except the father is my uncle! - The daughter is my cousin. - Didn't bother you! You always jump on assholes in trains and beaches? I love that! Beaches, trains. Go fuck yourself! Wait a second! It's my grandfather's birthday. You know that. I have to get back. Noga, wait for me. I'm begging you, wait! I'm going to be your daughter's aunt. I'm the father of your niece. It's incest. I don't think so. Any more puffed potatoes? Take mine. Eat! Live! I saved up for two years. I lived it up! Well, anyway... I have some good news. Clarisse and I... - Water! - No, don't! Heimlich maneuver. Let me. You're all right, darling. Who is he again? - My husband. - Oh, fine. Problem? Get out of my face! Look out! Leave them. You prick! Giovanna, a little dignity. Listen, Rabbi... - Someone hurt? - Everyone! Lord, what did I do? Don't feel guilty, love. I'll tell you how you fucked up. Practice all day. No ham, TV, vacation, comics. That's the result! She craves transgression! How about your daughter? Money, boats... Jewelry, assholes, women. That's her upbringing? Proud of yourself? Melita's free, fuck you! Noga is in love, fuck you! Looks like a hug. All right, can we go? Sure, no damage! Don't go! Don't go! Her water broke. That's nonsense. They must learn basic principles. Right away! Later on is too late. What basic principles? Oh, no. Forget it, I know. I'm already falling asleep. Banish theft, gossip, slander, insult, lies... Keep the Torah, insults, lies. I want to teach them to love the aroma of hot coffee and toast. A refreshing swim in early summer. A wood fire when it's freezing. Ham on a fresh baguette. Not that! All right, fine. A good pastrami sandwich. Sorry, I didn't mean that. Whatever we do, they'll give us trouble. Like the big girls. How does he seem to you? He knew me this morning. Dad! Let's go. Now this is nice. Now then... Vanilla. Pistachio! Thanks, Dad. Her first Rolex. Looks nice on you, Surélé. Her name is Marie-Sarah, Dad. She's my daughter. I got one... for each of them. A Tissot from 1949. - What's her name? - Natacha. Right, his granddaughter. My grand-niece. Noga and Sam's daughter. I see. And an Omega with manual wind for... Juliette, Roni's granddaughter, my grand-niece. Melita and Sam's daughter. - Sam? Who's Sam? - My son-in-law. - Yours? - My ex-son-in-law. They look alike. - Sure, they're sisters. - Half-sisters. - Aren't they cousins? - Yes, all 3. No, Marie-Sarah is Natacha's aunt. - No. - Yes! My daughter, half-sister to Noga, her daughter's half-aunt. I'm confused. It's complicated, Dad. It's family. Did I ever tell you about the 2 traveling salesmen in Bialystok, during the war? No, I never heard it. You? Come on, Dad. Tell us. Subtitles: Michael Katims Subtitling: Eclair Media
