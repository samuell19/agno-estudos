[relaxed violin, trumpet music] [relaxed ensemble music] - [Milo] Hi. - Hi. - Can I buy you a drink? - Champagne. - Ah, some champagne. So, what, what brings you to Tampa? - Oh, I'm just a bored suburban housewife looking for a little action in the big city. - Ah. [Maya laughing] - Oops. - [Milo] That's nice. [anxious violin music] [electronic beeping] - [Computer] Access granted. [Milo grunting] - No. - [Computer] Funds available. - Dammit. - [Computer] Transfer complete. [Milo laughing] [doors rattling] - [Milo] Who is this? - Get off. I should tear your balls off with my teeth. - I didn't know-- - I can't hear you. - Get off. Get off of him. Stop it. - [Tony] Get your ass out of here. - Stop. [tepid flute, violin music] What in the hell is wrong with you? God, Tony, sometimes you just lose it. - I'm sorry but I get crazy when a guy like that nearly screws you. - Oh, and I don't? It goes with the territory. - Are you saying that you'd sleep with that mark? - You never know. - Right, Maya. - How did we do? - Shitty. That Rumsen had like 10 cards but most of them were maxed out. - So what, five, six grand? - I could only transfer two and some change to the blank cards. - That's nickel and dime, Tony. - Hey. Relax. We're gonna make the big score. - When? - Soon. [relaxed flute, violin music] Soon, baby. - You're a dreamer, Tony. - I know. [anxious ensemble music] [electronic beeping] - Okay, Mr. Rumsen. - Thank you. [relaxed trumpet music] - Nails? Nails. Nails! - [Nails] Yeah, just hang tight, man, I'm in the darkroom. I'm coming. What the fuck? [Nails screams] - What's the matter? - My shrink says I need a hobby in order to help me relax, so I'm trying photography, right? But look. - What are they? - Some beaver shots of this biker chick I know. - What exposure did you use? - What am I, Ansel Adams? - Check this out, top of the line. - Nice, see this is what I need. Oh yeah. Hey, you wanna score some crystal meth, huh? Or some coke? Don't you and Maya party no more? - Come on, Nails, how much for the goods? - 1100 for everything. - Piss off. The camcorder alone's worth that. - Yeah, well then fence your crap someplace else. - It's rude but I'll take it. - What did my hard work buy you now? - Our hard work. And it's a carburetor. - Take it back. - It was custom job. No refund. - When did you order it? - A couple of weeks ago. - God, Tony, don't I ever have a say in how we spend the money around here? - Okay. I'm sorry, I won't do it again. - You don't get it, do you? You call this a life, living like this? I don't even know why we're still together. - Because we need each other, we're a team. - No, we're not. It's just convenient for the gaffe. Come on, we've got work to do. [relaxed piano music] - [Pierce] Oh, I love that, don't stop. - Sorry, I'm on my break. - I have an idea. - I'd like to settle up, dear. Turn around. Come here. Come here. I got some condoms in my wallet. My wallet's in my jacket. I want you to roll over on your stomach. You're gonna take it in the ass. - We're done here. What kind of freak-- [Maya screams] What are you doing? Fuck. Get off me. - You don't want me to look for my wallet, do you? Because you know it's not there. - What are you talking about? You know what, really, ow! - [Pierce] Call Tony. - What? - Call Tony. - How the fuck do you know Tony? - Call him! - Ow! - [Tony] Call the boyfriend! - All right. Just hand me my cell phone, I have to beep him. - Cell phone? [rattling] Beep Tony. [electronic beeping] - [Maya] Tony, look out. - [Pierce] Put your ass on the bed, Tony. - It's okay. - Come on, boyfriend, put it on the bed. - What do you want from us? - Well first, I'd like my wallet back, Tony. Please, if you don't mind? - You okay? - Give it to him. - Your credit rating is crap. - Sit on the bed, Tony. - You ain't a cop, so what's your angle? - We'll get to that. - How does he know our names? - I don't know. He's a freak. I'm okay. - Here's the deal. My employer is a very rich Rosedale lady. When I say lady, I mean bitch. She wants a divorce and she wants it quick and painless. So, what we need are some pictures of the husband being intimate. - Maya's not sleeping with nobody. - Who she screws is your affair, Tony. - Let's get the hell outta here. - And it pays 50 large. - 50 grand? - That's a 50 with three big, fat ass zeroes and all I need from you, Tony, are some pictures I can use. [distant sirens blaring] - Okay. - All right, I'll pick you up tomorrow at 10 o'clock, your place and Maya, wear something tasteful. - Wait a minute, slick. What about 10% up front? - The rest is strictly back-end. - You sure you want to do this? If you wanna back out, just say so now. - Save it, Tony. - No, I mean it. - You got a hard-on when he said 50 grand. - This could be our big score. Our ticket outta here. - This is the house that Jack built, a lot of Jack. - I can see the bitch could spring for a lot more. But you didn't push her. - You're gettin' paid. - Gettin' paid? So far, we've only seen the five grand. - I'll make sure you get it all, baby. - I'm sure you will, slick. - My name's Pierce. Here. - What's this? - That's a little background on our boy. - Not bad. - Let me see that. He looks like a jerk. Look at him. Only a wimp with something to prove would drive that. - Pelican Club, Julie Cafe, Spa on the Green, this guy's got some class. - A little out of your league? - Never met a guy who could resist her. - Shut up, Tony. What's the setup? - Okay, this is Martin Grifwold and his wife, Corinna, their marriage and welcome to it. That's the main house back there but she likes the cottage up north. They also have a condo downtown. - Tony, I've rented you a place opposite the condo. - That's where I shoot them from? - That's where you shoot them from, but carefully. This guy didn't get what he's got by being stupid. It'd be easy if he rented a hooker for the night. - Did he just call you a whore? - Put it back in your pants, Tony. I'm on. - No, hold on. You're gonna meet him tonight. - Good evening, Martin. - Felix. - Are you interested in this mask? - Not really. - Well, you should be. Legend has it that this mask symbolizes the inevitable end of a troubled relationship. - Oh, really? - Really. Corinna wants this over with soon. In case you've forgotten. - Lawyers. - I find some of these pieces to be a bit excessive, don't you? Don't you? - Don't I what? - Find some of these pieces to be, you know, excessive? - Yeah but it's an excess of the life to live art. - True, some artists have gigantic egos. - Yeah. - [Pierce] Okay. - Beautiful. - There's your camera, keep the blinds closed. - Where's the bathroom? - Bathroom? - Well, if I wanna take a leak. - Well in that case, I'll find out. Come here, boyfriend. Take a look across that. See the corner on the right, street level? - Yeah, okay. - That's Martin's. On the right-- - Is the bedroom? - That's the bedroom. - Okay. - [Pierce] That's where you get a money shot. You know anything about cameras? - That's a 35 millimeter Nikon F910 with a 600 millimeter telephoto lens, that's all and this baby is loaded with high speed film. I've got a thing for gadgets. - [Pierce] Okay. - [Tony] Oops, I got movement. [camera snapping] - Okay, move in. - [Tony] Marty boy's home. - Where's Maya? - I don't know. - She's not there? - No. He just has some big dick statue, what is he, gay? - I don't know, maybe he likes gadgets too. Remember, if she fucks him off camera, she's givin' it away. - Lay off her, Pierce, okay? - Fuck it, she's not showing. Okay, I'll tell you what, you got your phone with you? - [Tony] Yeah, I do. - You give Maya a call and find out what happened. I'll be back. - Wait a minute. Now that we're set up here, Maya and me were thinking it's time for some more cash. - Maya and you? - Yeah. Yeah, we were thinking another 20. - Whoa, you're the boss to go with that statue, huh? Here's your key. Get me my pictures, I'll get you your cash. - You have a nice day too. So what did he say? - I barely talked to him. There were too many people there. - You didn't try hard enough. - [Maya] I tried, this isn't easy. - Okay, so what's the next move? - Pierce says he goes to some bistro on Avenue Road every day. I'll just bump into him there. - Look, you're going to have to get him in the bed. - Why? - Because I can get a clear shot of the bed. The rest of the place is touch and go. - Shit. - You think I like it? - It just doesn't feel right. It's not a regular gaffe. - Just get me the shot. - God, you're all, you're all heart, Tony. I'm the one with my ass on the line. - Come on, I know but nothing's gonna go wrong. The guy's rich, so what? He's still just a mark. He's whack though, he's into some weird stuff. - Like what? - He brought home this thing, this statue with a raging hard-on, you know? - He did? - Yeah. Just don't worry. Hey. You'll play him. - Okay. Hi. I've got a bone to pick with you. More specifically, a boner. - How'd you get in here? - A little bribe can go a long way. You know damn well I had my eye on that piece and now I found out you bought it. - Hey look, before we launch into the debate, I think introductions are in order. Martin Grifwold. Now this is where you say your name. I know it's a silly custom, but effective. - Maya. - Maya, just Maya? - Yeah, just Maya. Martin, come on, what's the deal with this statue? Why did you steal it from me? - I didn't steal it, I bought it. But it's your own fault. - Really, how's that? - [Martin] Well if you hadn't pointed it out, I might never have noticed it. - All right, fair enough. When may I see him again? - When? - How about now? [Martin laughs] - You don't beat around the bush, do you? - Never had a reason to. - Make yourself at home. So, there it is. - There he is. - Would you care for a glass of wine? - That'd be great. What do you do, Martin? - I'm a broker. What do you do? - I've tried everything once, university, the gallery scene. Now, real estate. - [Martin] Oh, really? - Yeah, really. - I'm sorry, it's just that you don't strike me as the real estate type. - What type do I strike you as? [relaxed violin, trumpet music] - Look, I think I should tell you that I'm married. - I know. - [Martin] What? - People talk a lot at gallery openings. - Yeah, they do, don't they? [camera snapping] They also told me that my wife wants to sue me for divorce and then once it's final, I'm penniless, well, almost penniless. - You don't beat around the bush, do you? - Sorry for being so blunt. - It's okay. Why would you be penniless? - Prenuptial agreement. - Really? - You know what? I'd like to do something for you. - What? - I'd like to pay you back for stealing the statue. - What the hell, Pierce? - You've gotta keep your eye on the donut, not just the hole. You've gotta keep your eyes open, you've gotta win in this game, man. - Piss off. - [Pierce] So, how's a going? - [Tony] Great. - [Pierce] What's happening? - Not much. Maya's there. - Oh. Well, get me a few good pictures of her on her knees. "I love you, Tony. "I love you, I'm doing this all for you." - Are you asking for a beating? 'Cause I'll give you one. Is that my money, is that the 20 grand? - How did you know? - I guessed. - Do you want it? - You're lucky, no money, no pictures. - So coy. - You're such a jerk. - Don't ever offend me, you little fuck. - Jerk. Dammit. [relaxed violin, trumpet music] [Maya laughs] - That's it. Yeah, I'll buy it. So, where can I drop you? - [Maya] Anywhere up here's fine. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - All right, will I see you again? - [Maya] That'd be great. - How about tomorrow? - Okay. - Bye. [relaxed violin, trumpet music] - God, Tony, you scared me. - What's that? - [Maya] Martin bought me a few things. - Now it's Martin? Let me see. - It's nothing. - Come on. Let me see. Nails will give us a grand for this dress. - [Maya] I am not fencing it. - Why are you stalling? All we need is one picture and then we're outta here. He's just another mark to you, right? - Yes, Tony, he's just another mark. But it's gonna take a little bit of time, okay? Come on, relax. [thudding] What the hell is wrong with you? [relaxed trumpet, violin music] - [Martin] Let's go close. - [Maya] Wow. - [Martin] You see the bird? - [Maya] Woo! - Relax, boyfriend. Maybe it's foreplay. Sit back and watch, you might learn something. - I am warning you, Pierce. - What are you gonna do, whittle yourself a big dick? - All I'm saying is just shut up. - Oh, relax. Think about having sex with Maya. Whoop, she started without you. I'm going out, you want anything? - No, thank you. [relaxed violin music] - Listen, anybody can go click, click, click. You can even do that when you're squattin' to pee. But you're gettin' a free ride on your girlfriend's pussy. Probably not the first time. [anxious violin music] - That's a warning. - Better get whittling. - I'd love to see Venice someday. - Oh, it's beautiful, I'll get you a towel. - Okay, here we go. [Martin speaking foreign language] - I know the artists area and they have this grand ceolla that's to kill for. - Yeah? - Here, let me. - [Tony] Come on, get to the bed. - Have you ever thought of doing something else with your hair? - Why, you don't like my hair? - No, I do. It's just you're so beautiful and maybe a new look would highlight your face. [relaxed ensemble music] - I'll think about it. These last few days have been amazing. I feel like I've been transplanted to another world. - Dammit. That freakin' wall. [telephone ringing] - Don't worry, the machine will get it. - [Martin Recording] We're not in, leave a message. - [Corinna] Martin, what the hell is going on? I want this over, don't make me drive all the way to the city. The longer you draw this out, the worse it will get for you. That's a promise. - Fuckin' shut up! I'm sorry, it kinda ruins the whole day. - There must be something you could do. - No. Gosh, I was so stupid. I should have never signed that fuckin' prenup. And you know what ticks me off? I am the one who rebuilt the family fortune. I did the work, I made the investments. But she feels it's all hers. - I'm sorry. - No, I'm sorry. It's not your problem. I just want what I earned, goddammit. [relaxed violin, trumpet music] - Is there anything I can do? - No, thank you. I'll call you tomorrow. - [Maya] Tony? Tony? Are you in there? - What we're going for with you is just... - Yes, I know what you want, it'll be magnificent, sir. - All right. - Are you sure, Martin? - Yep, I'm sure. Treat her like a queen, that's what she is to me. - Well, let's take the plunge. [relaxed trumpet, piano music] Wait right there. - My god. - What's the matter? - Nothing, it's, you're stunning, it's just one little thing. - [Maya] What? - That's it, perfect. Hey, why don't you take a look in here, I'll be right back. - Where are you going? - I've got business around the corner, it won't take long. - Yes, right this way. - Excuse me? - Your ring is ready and I have to say that it is extraordinary. - There must be some mistake. - No mistake, your husband picked it out earlier today. He said you'd be in later and, well, there you are. - [Martin] Do you like it? - Oh, Martin, you can't. - I can and I did. - It's gorgeous. - It's you. - Well hello, beautiful. You into some high octane muscle? - Save it, Tony. It's me. - What the hell is this? Makeover day on Oprah? - What the hell is this? - It's just a rental. - Really? - Okay, I bought it, I needed something to perk me up because this job is killing me. - Yeah, I can see that, you look like hell. - That room is like solitary confinement and then I gotta watch you with that guy, that rich bastard. - How much did the car cost us? - If I want to buy a car, I'll buy a car. - Tony, tell me how much the muscle car was. - 42 and change. - You paid 42 grand for that piece of crap? Tony, where did you get that kind of money? - Don't get mad, it's-- - No, where? - Pierce. - Pierce gave you all that money? - Not all, he gave me 20 and I got the rest from Frankie the Bones. - Frankie the Bones, what is this, Goodfellas? Now I gotta go through with this so Frankie won't break your legs over a crappy car. God, Tony, once again, I gotta bail you out. - I can take care of myself, okay? - Oh, really? What if I don't go through with this, huh? Where would you be then? Ow. - Where'd you get this? - Let go. - Huh, where? - Martin gave it to me, okay? Ow. - I see. You can get rings and hairdos and clothes and stuff but I can get nothing! - Jesus, Tony, I didn't buy it, he did. I mean does that make sense to you or do you need a little chalk talk, huh? [Maya screams] Ow. Oh what, you're gonna hit me now? Oh yeah, that'd be real good. Oh good, then I can't screw Martin, I can't get the money for you. [clattering] I'm not your bitch, Tony. What, are you gonna hit me? Hit me. Go ahead, fuckin' hit me. - You're not neat, you know that, boyfriend? Guy's got a $500 mattress over there if they could use it. What'd you do to her hair, hmm? - Let me have a look at her. Oh, just a makeover. - I thought you liked it. - I love it, I just feel funny about it. - I want you to keep it. Always, Maya. [relaxed trumpet music] - Ooh, here we go, here we go, you're on. [camera snapping] [relaxed trumpet music] - Dammit, I lost them. Where are they? - They're behind the brick wall. - Come on, Maya. Get in the bedroom. Not that freakin' wall! - [Pierce] She's doggin' it, Tony, we're wasting film. - These are gonna be good enough. - She's doggin' it, I can't see his face. [relaxed trumpet music] What do you want for a piece of her? - Shut up. What a bitch. - What the hell was that about? Hmm? She's cheating on me! - I don't know what's going on here. - Don't gimme that crap. [smack] What was that, huh? [grunting] What was that? I give you 25 large and what do I get from you, huh? Hypersensitivity. I got your car as collateral. You're not leaving 'til I get my pictures! - You're dead! [anxious trumpet, violin music] - Where you going? - To get another bottle. - I'll go, save your strength. Martin, where is the bottle opener? - [Martin] The top drawer by the phone. [anxious violin, flute music] - [Maya] That the bitch for a wife? - Yes. - God, I am so stupid. You used me. - It was not supposed to happen like this. - Really? What's your angle? - My angle? - Yeah, your angle. Don't play games with me, Martin. God, you changed me into her doppelganger. Why, the money? - Well yes, of course, what do you think? You don't understand that but it's mine, I earned it. - Oh. I can't believe this. Pierce set this up. - Yes. Look. Pierce told me he found the perfect girl and when I saw you at the gallery, I was stunned. He was right, you look so much like her. I know I used you, you're right. - I thought you were a cute, rich boy. You're just a cute grifter. - Maybe. - So I'm supposed to just pose as Corinna, is that the deal? - And change the prenup, yes. Maya, you gotta understand, you are the only person on this planet that can help me get what's rightfully mine. - Oh. Gimme one reason why I should trust you. - I could give you 100 but the truth is [relaxed violin music] I fell in love with you. Hey. Look, I'm sorry. I didn't want to hurt you. - Why does Pierce need these photos? - What photos? - The photos of you and me. - What are you talking about? Pierce never mentioned any photos. - You don't know anything about these photos? - [Martin] No. - Oh my god. Don't you see, he's playing both ends against the middle? He's getting paid by Corinna too. - Wait, are you trying to tell me that Pierce is getting paid by Corinna to take pictures of you and me and not only you know all about it, but you're part of it? You're so goddamn worried about being used while you are using me. You are not a bit better than I am. All right. So, what now? - I don't know. - Are we together or not? - How much are we talking? - 58.1 million. - Dollars? Wow. That's huge. - Nothing we can't handle. Now, are we partners? - Partners. - And what about Pierce and? - Yeah, what about Pierce? [anxious violin music] - I don't know, why don't we just let him keep thinking he's in control, you know? Then when we sign the prenup, we can just disappear. Every gaffe needs a fall guy, right? - Right. [telephone ringing] - Yeah? - It's me. - What the hell, Maya, did you do him? You have fun? - Shut up and listen. - No, you listen. We need those shots, Pierce is ready to kill me. - That's not the problem. - I'll make it your problem. - I want you to lay low for now. - Are you cutting me loose? - Tony, the game has changed and I'm trying to help you. - Go to hell. [anxious violin, trumpet music] - That the boyfriend? - Yeah. It's over. I just hope he doesn't get in our way. [thud] - [Corinna] Come on dear, Baumgartner asked you to call him days ago. - Baumgartner, he asked you to call him days ago. - Here. So, are you ready for Corinna's world? - It's pretty. Oh, Martin. Do you really think I can pull this off? - Look. Corinna's been out of circulation for months now. I hear dropped hints about her getting plastic surgery, so don't worry, people will expect her to look as good as you. - Thank you. - All right, Don Fellebedough, Corinna's rich partner. - Corinna? You look marvelous. - Thank you, Don. I'm sorry, just a touch of something. - Ooh. Martin, good to see you. - Yeah, good to see you, Don. Oh, we're celebrating the revitalization of our marriage. - Well it suits you both, congratulations. - Thank you. - [Maya] Hey. - That looks very good. - Thank you. - How'd you do that? - Remember that kid in school that used to write you the fake notes from home? - That was you? - Mm hmm. That was me. - All right, let's go over tomorrow. - Baby. Let's go over tonight, huh? - Come on. Just once, okay? Let's go. - Okay. Call Vivian the red-headed secretary Scarlet for Scarlett O'Hara. - Very good, keeping going. - And when she tells me Baumgartner isn't in, why don't we want Baumgartner? - He's known Corinna all her life. - I'm sorry, yes, Mr. Baumgartner is out of the office today. May I give him that message? All righty. Oh. Hello, Corinna. Wow. - Hello Scarlet, look what I got you. Just a touch of laryngitis, stress and all. Anyway, I was in this fabulous spa in Mayorga last month and I was thinking of you. - What? - What? - Honey, you, you look fantastic, sweetheart. You are a radiant bloom. Now what is he doing here? - Now, don't be shocked but I think we've patched things up. - I heard that this morning but I thought it was just idle gossip and you know, I don't go in for that kinda stuff. - Of course not, is he in? - Mr. Baumgartner, no, he isn't in today. - We have to get this taken care of today. What about Gordon Chan? - Well sure, Gordon's, oh. - Hello, Vivian. - Mr. Grifwold. Why don't you two go and wait upstairs in the conference room, all right? Great. [electronic beeping] - [Martin] We're not in, leave a message. [Corinna groans] - Martin. Where the hell are you? You're dead when I get back to town, you piece of shit. - Look Gordy, it's very simple. I want to amend the prenuptial agreement. - But ma'am, this would change everything. Could I speak to her alone, sir? - Sure. [cell phone ringing] - Hello? - [Pierce] Hi darling, I got the pictures. - Finally. Meet me at Baumgartner's. - I don't think that's a good idea. Let's meet over at your apartment. - Fine. - Mrs. Grifwold. He will have full access to all your accounts. You will become each other's beneficiaries and he will get half of everything if you divorce. - I'm not an idiot, I understand. But I want it changed. - Ma'am, I can't allow you to just-- - Gordy, who's the firm's biggest client? - Well, well, I'd have to say, well if you meant the biggest, I mean that would be-- - Who? - You, ma'am. - Yeah. So either you change the prenup and notarize our signatures or I'll leave this firm. Would you like to tell Mr. Baumgartner that you lost his biggest client? - I'll get the papers. [phone ringing] - Hello? - Hello, yeah boyfriend. You get the afternoon off. Go to the beach, get a tan or something. Just get the hell outta there. - Pierce? Hello? [relaxed violin music] Maya? [knocking] - [Corinna] I'm coming. Pierce, knock it off. [Corinna groans] [anxious ensemble music] - [Tony] You trying to fuck me over? - [Pierce] What the... [camera snapping] - [Tony] Huh? - [Pierce] Oh, boyfriend. - Who the fuck are you? - [Corinna] Take whatever you want, please. - Shit. - Take, take everything. - All right. Corinna. Hi, darling. You look marvelous. - What do you fuckin' know about this? - What'd I miss? I try to keep up, I watch the news, I watch CNN. - Knock it off. I was fuckin' nearly killed. My 100 grand didn't buy your loyalty, huh? - You wouldn't believe my overhead. [helicopter whirring] - You fucking leech. You're fucking trying to leech me, aren't you? Trying to suck me try. Well not anymore. That's it. Where's my fucking phone? - How about another shot to calm you down? - I mean it, Pierce, I've had enough of your sh... [gunshots booming] [anxious violin music] [cell phone ringing] - Yeah? - [Pierce] It's done. - Pierce? What the hell are you talking about? You did it? Where? Okay. - Congratulations. It's done. - Thank you. [Maya laughing] It worked, ha ha. It worked. - Yeah. Okay, so far, so good. Now let's get home and pack. - Pack? - Yep, we're leaving for a holiday tomorrow. - Ooh. - Anything keeping you here? - Nope. Where are we going, Venice? - Barbados. I've got some interests there to look into and the beaches this time of the year are to kill for. - You mean to die for. - Okay, to die for. - I don't have a passport. - Not to worry, I've got Corinna's. [anxious ensemble music] - [Maya] Wasn't there a rug here? - Oh yeah, it's at the cleaners. - Ooh. - Cheers. - Cheers. Ah. - So, it's all set. Tickets, passports, just one last thing before we take off. - What? - Corinna keeps a sizeable amount of cash in her safe at the house. We'll need it 'til the money is transferred. - A Swiss account? - [Martin] Nothing less. - Ugh. - What's wrong, are you all right? - Yeah, I'm just, ooh, I feel dizzy. - Why don't you go to bed? - Yeah. Oh, I gotta pack Corinna's stuff. - Don't worry, I'll do that. - Really? - Yeah. - [Maya] Thank you. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. [phone ringing] - Hello? Okay, I'll see you then. [knocking] - [Tony] Nails! [Nails coughing] - Ah, man. - Wake up. - Who is it? - [Tony] Tony! - Ah, for fuck's sake, fuck. - It's me, open the door. - Man, what the hell is goin' on, huh? - I need a camera, gimme your camera. - A camera? - Gimme your camera, please. - All right, just hang on. - Come on, move it. What happened? - Photography sucks. - Get me a paperclip and some duct tape, will you? [anxious violin music] - I'll meet you outside. Maya. Maya. Now we even got pictures of poor little Tony boy handling her. - That's right. He won't even know there's a murder 'til the cops pick him up for it. - What about us and the cops? - Hey, if you were a cop, would you believe a story about surveillance photos and body doubles where the photographer is stupid enough to get himself on film? - I guess not. - The loose end is the girl. - Don't worry, I'll handle her. - You will? - Of course I will. - Good. I can count on you for that? - Of course. [anxious violin music] [camera snapping] - So I guess Corinna left you a shitload of money. - Yes, and I plan to hold onto it. - What about me? - What about you? - Well it's just I know things, is all. [camera snapping] - Blackmail can be dangerous. But you know what, Pierce? Blackmail doesn't kill people. People kill people. [anxious violin music] - Hey. [camera snapping] That's not fair. [gunshot clacks] [Pierce gasps] Amateur. [gunshot clacks] - I had to do it. He would've sucked us bone dry, I had no choice. - Are you gonna handle me now? - No. No, of course not. That was Pierce's plan. Get rid of all the loose ends, you know? First Corinna and then... I need you, Maya. I need you more than anything else. - Even more than the money? - Come here. Come here. Come on. Come here. [soft trumpet music] Even more than the money. [relaxed violin music] Okay? - Okay. Oh my god. Tony. - What the hell's going on? I'm seeing two of you. It's like a weird "X-Files." - It's complicated, okay? - Okay. Let's try simple first. I've got a few candid moments on here of Marty boy doin' Pierce. - And? - Well, I'm thinking this gaffe is one big orgy of grifters but the only one gettin' it in the ass is me! - Tony, you can't be here right now, okay? It's not safe for you. - I think it is. - So what do you want? - The rest of the money plus a bonus. - With these pictures, I can get both. - The last guy that tried to blackmail him is on the way to the river. - I can handle Marty boy. [anxious ensemble music] [splashing] Played us from the jump, huh? Her body's in my car. So even if I burn these, I'm still screwed. - Yeah. - I wasn't trying to kill you, I mean her. - Gimme a break, Tony. - Maya. You've gotta believe me. - Okay great, I believe you. Listen to me, he's gonna be back any minute. We've gotta work fast. - What's the angle? - You still got the Escort? - Yeah. - Where in the hell is it? - What's wrong? - Corinna's passport, it was in here, right? You saw it, I saw it and now it's gone. - I never really saw it, Martin. - It's gotta be somewhere, dammit! - Relax, baby. Relax. - Yeah, yeah, okay. - Relax. - Okay. What do we do now? - Okay well, you reschedule the flight and I'll just get a replacement passport. - Okay, that'll work. It's even better with your picture on it. So, [clapping] come on, let's go. - No, seaweed, it was some kinda seaweed. Well she lost 40 pounds, what do you ex, I don't. Oh listen, gotta go, bye now. Honey. - I can't tell you what a nightmare yesterday was. - Oh, I knew it, I knew something was wrong, what? Tell me, tell me. - I was having an affair with an older man. Martin found out. - You're kidding. - That's what the fiasco yesterday was all about. He forced me here. He had a gun. - Oh, good lord of the dance, a gun? - I want to undo everything and go back to the original prenup. - Right, oh, you know what? Mr. Chan, he didn't file it yet. Here, here, there you go. - Is Mr. Chan in? - Oh, yeah. Mr. Baumgartner, he's really anxious to see you. - Corinna. - Oh no. - What's going on with her? - Oh, you have no idea, come, come on, come, come, come. She has laryngitis because of the stress and apparently Martin caught Corinna with an older man and then Martin, oh, he forced her to change the prenup, but that was under duress of course. He terrorized her, terrorized her, he had a gun. Oh, a gun, a gun, no, what is there, an echo in here? All right, all right, the point is she wants to change the prenup back to its original language. That's what's going on with her. Oh, and did I mention she got the best facelift I have ever seen? - You mentioned that the first thing this morning. Would you go in there and get her out? - Okay. [knocking] Corinna? Honey? It's all right, we all understand, men are assholes. He must have really scared you, huh? - He did. Right now, I just can't face-- - Mr. Baumgartner? Oh. Now, you know as well as I do, he has a soft spot for you the size of my Aunt Mavis. - I feel like such a fool. - He's on your side, sweetie. - Could you have him drop the papers and I'll be out when I feel up to it? - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, you, you take all the time that you need, all right? - Okay. - Okay. It'll be fine. [electronic beeping] - [Martin] Hello? - Martin. It's me, Corinna. I'm at the lawyer's office. - [Martin] The lawyer's? - Yeah, Baumgartner's. You'll have to come, I'm signing some new papers. - [Martin] What the hell are you doing? - Rescind and negate all amendments pertaining to the original prenuptial agreement, date it and she can have the rest. - Okay. - When you were with Mrs. Grifwold, did she seem to be okay to you, did she seem unusual or-- - Different? Well you know, she is under so much stress and what with that plastic surgery, oh my god. - Thanks, Vivian. - Yeah. - I'm not leaving here until I see my wife, okay? What are you doing? - Hey. Stop it! - [Maya] Calm down, should I call the police? - Let go. - Let him come in. Oh, oh help me. No. I'm so sorry. He found out about my affair and he made me change everything. - Hey look, look, she's under a lot of stress. - And whose fault is that? - She's just not herself. - That still gives you no reason to terrorize your wife. - Hey, you don't understand, she's not! - She's not what? Your wife? Terrorized? - Corinna, darling, everything was perfect last night, no? Don't be a fool, okay? - Are the papers ready? - Yes, they are. - Don't. Don't. - [Gordon] Hold it. - [Martin] Corinna! - Get him out of here, will you? - We're still married! Corinna! Corinna! - I leave the office for one day and all hell breaks loose. Will you excuse us for a moment, Vivian? Thank you. - I'm so sorry for all the drama. - Oh, are you kidding? I loved seeing Martin have a coronary. - Thank you. Don't you need to notarize it, Felix? [relaxed violin music] - You haven't called me that for years. Are you going to be all right? - Yes. - Well, call me. We'll have dinner and talk about all this mess. - Thank you. Martin. - Get in. I said get in! [anxious violin, flute music] What the hell is goin' on? - Calm down. You were perfect. - Perfect? You blew it. - I didn't blow it. I made it better for us. - Oh yeah, and how's that? - Once you got your hands on Corinna's money, I was expendable. Maybe not right away but if you got tired of me or we got in a little spat or something, I'd have to look over my shoulder for another Pierce to come along. - Look. I love you. Can't you see that? - And I love you. But this way, you also need me. The old Corinna wanted to dump you. This Corinna wants to keep you. - So you planned everything, including my tirade? - Yep. Baumgartner and Chan were getting suspicious and I was sure they were gonna stonewall us. But not anymore. You and me fighting like hyenas, that's what they understand. - I'm gonna have to keep my eye on you. [trolley bell ringing] [engine revving] - Woo. This place is beautiful. - Yeah. You'd be amazed how ugly it got. Oh no, please. - What, baby? - The combination, she must have changed it, dammit! - Do we really need the money? - Yes, baby, I need the money, trust me, okay? - [Maya] Okay. Well, was she good with numbers? - Corinna? The only number she knew was to her pharmacist. - And this was her room? - Yes. What are you getting at? - What did she care about more than anything else? - Maya, please, this is-- - [Maya] Martin, come on. - Pills, booze. The spa. Valentino's Dream. - Valentino's Dream? - [Martin] Her horse. - Is this Valentino's Dream? - Yeah. [Maya giggles] - Ta-dow. Try 14-22-57. [safe rattling] - You've got it. - Wow. [doorbell rings] Who's that? - Shit, the police. Remember, you're Corinna, okay? Gentlemen, what is it? - Martin Grifwold? - Yes. - I'm Detective Walpole and this is my partner, Detective Marconi. May we come in? - Of course. [anxious violin music] - So, we're obligated to follow up every tip we receive, no matter how crazy. - I understand. - But this one seemed to pan out. We found a body floating in the docks. Also, can you explain these? [Maya gasps] - Oh my god. Oh my god, Martin, you killed him. - What? - You know this man? - That's my Pierce. - Wait a minute. - It's Pierce. - Come on, this is crap. - We were having an affair. - Don't listen to that. You double-crossing bitch. [shouting] - That's enough. - Okay, okay. - I wanted a divorce, he wouldn't let me go, he killed him. - She's lying through her teeth, okay? You better shut up, you stupid slut. - Listen, if you don't settle down, I'm gonna have to take you-- - You better listen to me, you prick 'cause you're makin' a big mistake here, okay? She is not my wife. That psycho bitch is not my wife. Her real name is Maya, Maya something. I don't remember her last name and I don't give a shit. - I can't believe it. - But that piece of shit here is not Corinna Grifwold. Now do you get that, you moron? - That's enough! - Take him to the car and cuff him. - You're dead, bitch. I tell you, you're dead, okay? - [Marconi] Let's go, let's go. - [Maya] He attacked me here. [relaxed violin music] - Okay. - Excuse me. - All right. Let him in. - Corinna, are you all right? - Yes, it was horrible. He killed Pierce. - Shh, shh, shh. It's all right. - Excuse me. I'm Detective Walpole with Homicide. - I'm Felix Baumgartner, Ms. Grifwold's attorney. - [Walpole] Could I have a word with you? - Yes, of course. Excuse us. - Mr. Grifwold keeps telling me that she isn't really his wife. - Detective, I have known Corinna Grifwold all of her life and that is Corinna Grifwold. - Yeah, okay. But I've gotta tell you that things just don't add up. And I've gotta let you know I need to ask a lot of questions. - Corinna, come on. - Where? - I'm gonna take you down to the 22nd Division. The Detective wants to ask you a few more questions. Don't worry, it's all routine, come on. Are you going to tell me who you are? - Does it really matter? - I suppose not but I do deserve an explanation. Is Corinna dead? [somber violin music] - Yes. - Did you kill her? - No, Martin and Pierce killed her. They were just using me for obvious reasons. A lot of people would kill for $58 million. - Yes, they would. Why shouldn't I turn you in? - A better question, why didn't you turn me in at the house? The answer, it's not in your best interests. - What might they be? - I read that in the event of Corinna's death, her estate goes to you. - That's a standard clause. - Somehow I don't think the cops are gonna think it's so standard. After all, you'll end up with the money. - I see. - And when they ID Corinna, you don't want them asking you questions about how you know me. You'll have plausible deniability. [Felix laughs] What's so funny? - Nothing, it's just that you seem so much like Corinna. - Yeah, I fooled Scarlet and I fooled Chan. I fooled lots of people, why not you? - She never called me Felix. I was always Boomer. - Look. Why don't you pull up over here and tell the police I jumped out of the car and I disappeared? That's all you know. Okay? - Okay. - Again, I'm really sorry. [relaxed violin music] Have a good life, Boomer. - Like freakin' clockwork, baby. What the hell? - It's yours. It's more than enough to take care of Frankie the Bones. Tony, it's not safe for you here. You have to disappear. - What about us? We're a team. - There's no us, Tony. - We just made the biggest score of our lives and now you wanna walk away? - This isn't a big score, it's a big lie. - We don't have to live like this. We can go straight, I can get a real job, you know? I could do security or something. - Would you listen to yourself? [relaxed violin, flute music] - What are you gonna do? - I don't know. But for a little while, I was somebody important, special. I want to go see if I can find that life for myself. [relaxed violin music] [relaxed ensemble music]
