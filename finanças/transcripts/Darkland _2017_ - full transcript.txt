Darkland A film by Fenar Ahmad Breathe. Breath. What are you nervous about? Breathe. Close your eyes and relax. Breathe. Close your eyes and relax. Breathe. Wake up! Why are your eyes closed? You're not on fucking vacation! Are you stupid, brother? - Here. - I just know this will get screwed up. If you screw this up, I'll feel really sorry for you? Do you get that?! - Yes. - Put on the fucking gloves. Come on. Don't look around. Go straight into the bank. Come on. Come on. Come on. Get inside. Empty. Fill. Yallah, go! Don't think too much. - Where's the bag? - Ten seconds. Yallah. Let's roll. Yallah, traffic. This is a robbery! Give me the money! Hurry up! Come on! - Are you deaf? Give me the money! - It won't open. Go through the back. A little further out to the side. Yes, thank you. Retracting plier. Pacer is well-functioning. And stand by. - And we have a heartbeat. - That just never gets old. Unstable, but lets see what happens. And we have a fin sinus rhythm. The patient is stable. Carry on. Let's close him. Come here. - I think we can call it a day. - Thank you. - Nice work, everyone. - Say hi to Stine for me. Cheers! - We're so happy you could all make it. - Thanks for having us! Congratulations. - Thanks. - Great job! - Stine, how far along are you? - Hey, we were talking about me. - We we'll get to you. - This is all your fault. Seven months. - And there are two, right? Double up. - There's only one in the scan. - May we see it? - Yes, show them. - Come on! Let's see it. - We want to see embryo pictures! - It's a boy. An anatomical freak. - What are you talking about? - Huge penis. - Oh my God... - That's the umbilical cord. - It's a penis. Look how cute he is already with his little nose and mouth. It's the umbilical cord. - I'm gettin' drunk... - And so you should, honey. - Right. I'm just sayin'. - It's great, honey. - When are you off to France? - Friday. - What? Seriously? Where to? - Cote d'Azur. - I hope you're not... - You were just in the Caribbean. - It's just for two days. - In and out, as they say. - A weekend trip. - Put away your phone, honey. - It's at an old shipyard. - What did I miss? - He must know everything. - Afraid of missing out on an event. - Is there cake? - Nah... Cake, cake! Hey Stine. Is Zaid home? I've tried calling my brother. - It's probably on mute. Come on in. - No, thanks. I just need a word. - Zaid. - Yes? - Go back to our guests, okay? - Sure. - Listen, Zaid... - Hang on. - I've been calling. - Are you okay? You don't answer your phone. I'm in big trouble. I need your help. I'm fucked, man. People are after me and shit. Listen to me for a second... - Zaid... - Yasin, Yasin, shh. Listen, Yasin... We have company. It's Friday night. We're celebrating... - I know you have guests, man. - Not tonight, okay? Do you need money? - I can't explain.. - How much? I need 100,000, and then I promise I'll be done with all this crap. Zaid, give me a chance. I'm totally fucked. Just this one chance. Just one, and I promise to never ask for money again. Yasin I can't give you 100,000. I swear on your son's grave this is the last time I ask you for money... My son hasn't even been born yet, do you hear me? Please give me a chance, Zaid. Am I not your brother? - Am I not your brother? - Come on. Push the button. You don't understand! Everyone's after me! - Everyone? - I'm fucked! - Zaid, just one last time! - Push the button. I swear this is the last time, Zaid! Go back in, honey. I'll be right there. Go on. - I can feel him breathing all day. - It's kinda... It burns the throat. - Is everyone's glass full? - Yup. Thanks. - There... - Party time. - Cheers. - We're so happy you could come. I'm so proud of you. I am. - Don't you believe me? - Sure. - It won't even fit in my hand any more. - No. Try with two hands. There was a little more... Zaid, may I have a word? - Now? - Yes, now. Please count the napkins. Yes? I'm sorry, Zaid. Your brother has been brought to the emergency room. - Why? - He's severely injured. - Hey... don't go in there. - Out of my way! It doesn't look good, Zaid. There's nothing we can do. - Go. I'll tell them. - Okay. Come here. Thank you. Nothing could be done. Yasin. Yasin... no, no, no...! Do you need some more time? I could... No, that's fine. Let's get it over with. - Unite him! - There is no god but God. - Unite him! - There is no god but God. There is no god but God. Muhammad is the messenger of God. Paradise is a right. Hell is a right. And the end of the world is a right. In honour of the deceased we will say Al-Fatiha together. May God bless your presence. Torben... - My wife, Stine. - Hi. Torben. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - What are you having? - A boy. That's good. Stop by. It would be nice to see you. I think you should go to your parents for a couple of hours. I can't handle it. Not right now. I'll do it tomorrow. I think it would be a good idea to go hold your mom and talk with your dad. - Right? - Yeah, okay. Good. - Shall I go talk... - No, you're not going anywhere. Yeah! What do you think I want? Take a wild guess. From our summer vacation. When he was a baby. Who are you? My condolences. I'm Alex. I was Yasin's friend. His friend? What happened to him? If you know anything, you can tell me. I'm talking to the police tomorrow. I thought as much. Have a good smoke. Isn't that what you say? Hey, wait. I know he worked at the trap house at Lunden for a guy called Branco. - What was he doing there? - What do you think? Alex? Zaid. - Zaid? Hi. Welcome. - Thank you. Let me just say that what happened was deeply tragic. It's never okay when someone young dies. You must give yourself time to process it. Have you talked to anyone? A psychologist perhaps? No, I haven't but... I'm a doctor myself so... Thanks. Claus, I came here to find out - - how the investigation is going. Any suspects? No, we're not quite there yet, I'm afraid. Okay. I stopped by my parents yesterday - - and 30-40 thugs were hanging out around the mall. I had a feeling that they... Have you talked to any of them? No. We don't accuse people at random. We can't go around suspecting everyone with dark skin and brown eyes. No, of course not, but that is the area you're focusing on? We keep all options open. Claus, we have a tip on the other case that we should move on now. - Would you excuse me a minute? - Sure. - Apologies, Sadid. - Zaid. Zaid, yes of course. There are so many names to remember, so... But, Zaid, as soon as we hear anything, you'll be the first to know. - Right. - I hope I was of some help. Janni Svendsen is a 72-year-old woman at out ambulatory in Herlev. She has a chronic dissection. In good condition. Elderly but with functioning lungs and kidneys. Should we operate on her? We don't know when it happened? She's at great risk of dying. Zaid, damn it, man. I'm sorry to hear about your brother. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Are your paintings selling? Yeah, that one right there... Hey, babe. What's up? Hi. Good to see you. I've sold three to a private showing. Same guy. Jens Peter Brask. Biggest collector ever. Hey, guys! Hi, hello sweetie. It's been forever. - You were passing out jelly shots. - It's the last thing I remember. Anders and Zaid, I want you to meet... Zaid, get over here. Ronnie. The King of Copenhagen. - And Shami. - Hi. Will you excuse me? I just need to... Get some for me. I just need one. I'll mobile-pay you. - Sure. - Thanks, sweetie. What the hell? Keepin' warm in the car? ...a few months maybe, but we don't have a few months. We need more time. Take care, alright? Thanks, guys. Hey, Zaid. It's freezing. Aren't you coming inside? Aren't you coming inside? Don't stay out here. It's not good for you. - Sorry! Sorry... - Go join your guests. Hey... Hey! What's going on? I'm just getting some fresh air. Hail a cab, okay? Is anything exciting going down in the Middle East? Just because it doesn't matter to you doesn't mean it doesn't matter to me. Did you talk to the police? What can the police do? What can the police do? What can the Danish police do? We have to handle our own problems. Don't turn your back on me! You should've looked after your brother! - Or have you forgotten who we are? - Forgotten what? - So you did forget! - Who are we? We're Iraqi! We're Iraqi, you bastard! Have you forgotten, we're Iraqi? This is Iraq? Look! Is this Iraq? Or that? Your brain is in Iraq while your son becomes a street punk! You've been in Europe for 30 years! In Denmark. On that damn couch! We live here! You've been on that couch for 30 years! Get up! Get off the couch! Get a job! Get up, man! Can't you be at peace for once? I can't handle it any longer. - It's all your fault! - What do I have to do with it? - It's your fault! - Is everything always my fault? Come. Come here. I need you. - Where did you get that? - I found it in your brother's room. - Why didn't you give it to the police? - They'd go after your father. - Does he know? - No, of course he doesn't know. What we know is that your brother was involved in organized crime. Who killed him isn't something you talk about in that environment. And they're not the kind of people who talk to the police. So basically you have nothing. Is that the problem? Well... We're in the midst of a process that I cannot involve you in. But you do have fingerprints, right? You have DNA evidence? You have a theory that you're investigating? - I don't care for your tone. - Oh, I'm so sorry. And I'm sorry you lost your brother. I really am. But he was part of a group that aren't God's finest. - I hope you realize that. - What does that mean? "Not God's finest...", so the murder of this 20-year-old boy isn't a priority? He wasn't a boy. He was a 20-year-old man! I'll show you. I wouldn't normally do this, but you need to see it. When will you learn to control your kids, so they don't all turn to crime? He was a 20-year-old man and criminal to the bone. He couldn't follow the law. So the next time you want to tell me how to do my work - - book an appointment with my secretary! Understood! What are you doing here? Is this where your weed joint is? Branco, can I talk to him? We're almost ready. I'll call you back. Welcome. Sit down. - No, thanks. - I'm telling you to sit down, man. I hear you're talking to people. What do you want to talk about? - Yasin. - Do you know any Yasin? - I don't know any Yasin. - We don't know any Yasin. I know Yasin used to come here. - I'm Yasin's big brother. - Get him a Coke. No, thanks. Drink. - My brother's dead... - I'm telling you to drink. - You're Branco. - Yeah. I know Yasin worked for you. I don't care what you do... - We don't do shit. - Right, Branco. My brother's dead. - Shut the fuck up. - I just wanna know what happened. Look at me. Look at me, man. This isn't a fucking social club. Open your mouth, man. I don't know you or your brother. I've told you many times. Don't show your face around here again. Show some fucking respect. Get him out. Am I not your brother? Everyone's after me! Believe me! Good morning. Good morning. Why are you in a T-shirt? Were you at the hospital last night? Yes. - Please wake me when you leave. - Yes, sorry. I was in a rush. - Would you like eggs or muesli? - Yes, please. Shouldn't you take some time off? I can't, honey. I'm not talking about a leave of absence, just a week or so. Stop it, please. You know I can't. Zaid, you're not okay. And look at you! I mean... Zaid? I talked to some of Yasin's friends. Or... people he worked with. Selling hashish or whatever. Okay, and...? They said fuck you. Fuck your mother, fuck, fuck... - They don't say much. - Did they do anything to you? No. I recognized them from when they were kids running around the yard. I just know they're involved. And if not, at the very least they know... The police handles stuff like that, okay? Zaid... - Yes. - Yes, it stops here. - No, it's not done. - Surely you've written something. Yes, but once it's done, it goes straight to the police. I'd like to read it. I know. But you should spare yourself certain things. Anders, I'll get hold of it no matter what. You know that, right? On your toes. Come one! Go! Go! Go! Come one! Come here. Kick. Okay, in place. Uppercut. Come on. Punch here. Punch here. Faster! That's great. In place. Nikki. Let's go. Fast, come on. This is how it's done, people. That's right! Good job. Come on, boys. Come on. Block! Block! Block! Faster, faster, faster. I'm sick of this! I want the fucking belt up on that wall. Yallah! What's up, brother? All good? I have some tricks for the boys. I want the boys to win belts, you know? Do they think this is just for fun? I'm all messed up. I had those for Arab girls, I told you I took them up there. But they didn't wanna do anything. All dried up. I bought four bottles of Grey Goose. After three glasses - - They started dancing. I got wasted, brother. But it was just an ape party. You know? - My head's still fucking spinning, man. - Fuck it, bro. - Are you on top of everything? - He's ready. I'm just waiting. - The transport is in place. - Perfect. Milking time, bro. - Lux, man. - Harvest time, brother - Let's grab some dinner tonight. - Sure. - Let's go blow off some steam. - Yeah, it's been rough I just have some business with this one. Sit down. Sit the fuck down. - Where were you? - At Sunday with... - Why don't you answer you phone? - It's turned off. - Maybe it's at Maria's - 'Maybe'? - I'll go check. - Listen to what I'm telling you. I don't want to mess up your face. But if you don't come back with the phone and my money - - I'll fuck your face! Do you hear me? Don't show your face anywhere! Fucking ape. Torben! What the hell? - I'll just wipe my... - Bring it in. - Lars! Take a look at this. - No way! Old warrior You still here? Did you finally get married? It's damn good to see you, man. How's your mom doing? It is what it is, you know? And I guess you have nice long talks with your dad. Yeah... This should look familiar. Nice, eh? - That can't be the same one. - Sure, it's the same. - I want to start training again. - Why? - The police won't do anything. - Zaid. They can't or they won't. But Yasin's killers are out there. - Zaid. - That doesn't work for me. - You're losing it. - I have to find out who did it. Those little gangster boys. They're exploiting children. - Yes. - They make them do their dirty work. Then they kick them out. Or beat them to death like Yasin. And there's nothing you can do about it. You're a doctor, Zaid. You're a doctor. - The gangs aren't like in the old days. - It's the same shit. Zaid, it's a different ball game now. A knife ten years ago is an AK-47 today. They took Yasin from me. And that's okay? Is that okay with you? Anyone can be a gangster, Torben. They're just pusher boys. Come on. Again! Again. Come again. Focus! Come on, God damn it! Wake the hell up! More. More! Come! Come on! 5, 6, 7, 8. Come on, Zaid. Here! No, damn it! Hit it. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. That's right. Nice right hook! That's right! Yeah! Great! Alex! What's up? - What are you doing here? - I was just out for a run. You've started training? - I used to train. Then I stopped. - Because of... No, I actually train better when I'm high. I don't know, I just lost motivation. Then come with me. - I have plans. - Come on. You already smoked, right? You can help me keep up the pace. Come. 4,5,6. That's it! And now for the punch! Great! Come again. Right hook. The hook. Yes! Right hook! That's awesome! Time out! - Good work. - Thanks. Good work. Hold the bag, would you, so I can do one more round. Just let me finish smoking. Hold the bag, come on. Pull up my hood. - Do you have a girlfriend? - Yeah. I'm seeing 3-4 ladies... 3-4 ladies? I never got the hang of the girlfriend thing. So I just see different girls. - Do you have a girlfriend? - I have a wife. One's plenty. - You share a flat, a car, a dog? - Flat, dog and Volvo. - Don't you want that? - Nah. - Relax, man! Fuck that, man. - Come on. Let me finish my joint. Fuck this shit. - Why are you kicking like that? - Come on. Hold it. Okay. Go. I'm ready. Stand fast on your legs, so I can't push you. Use your whole body. Ready? Yeah got it. - Wall. - You can kick harder than that. I'm done. Hungry? - Sure, if you're buying. - I'm buying. - I have 3-4 different ones. - At the same time? No, not at the same time. Yet. But I'd like to try that. And they come on different days. Like, Monday it's Fie... ...Tuesdays it's... what's her name again? - What if you can't remember her name? - It's on my phone. They come over and have a nice time. They clean and cook and... Sweet girls. You live in there? Come. The elevator is over here. Let's take the stairs. I want to see all of it. - The stairs? I live at the top. - So, we'll make a trip of it. I wanna see everything. It looks insane. Can you open the roof or is it shut permanently? - Nah, I don't think so. - This is the last one, right? - You're the one who wanted to talk. - Yeah, I know. It isn't hard. This is the last one. Wow. - Hi. - Hi, honey. We have company. This is Alex. Stine, my wife. - Alex. - Stine. Hi. Where were you? I've been calling. Check out of the view. - Who's he? - A friend of Yasin. I saw him at the funeral and then bumped into him a couple of times. Okay. Don't tell her we were at Torben's garage. - A soda? - Thanks. - You're welcome. - You dip that in the water. - What's it made of? - It's rice paper. It's made of rice. - You have a beautiful place here. - Thank you. - Can you put salt on this? - You can put anything you want. How about you? Are you in school or working or...? - No, not really. - Neither? No, I play computer games. PlayStation or...? No, stationary PC. Computer, I mean. And what do you play? Poker and stuff? No, it's a strategy game. It's called the Battle for Middle-Earth. You construct a city online, and then you attack your opponent. And you can get to different levels and get stuff. Okay. Have you finished it or won or...? You don't win. It just continues indefinitely. You have an avatar that you keep building on. My avatar, for instance, is an Orc. From Uruk-hai. - An Unokai Orc? - Uruk-hai. - Uruk-hai - Orc. - Orc. - Yes. - Orc. - Yes. - Uruk-hai - Orc. He's detached himself from Saruman in Isengard. Oh, like in The Lord of the Rings? Exactly. But not a story you know. It's called War in the North. It only exists in the game. Not in the movie. - Or the books... - Or the books. I spend a lot of time doing that. - No, thanks. - Come on, have a taste. It's good. - It won't make me drunk, will it? - Not at all. You can handle it. - That looks so professional. - I've seen it in the movies. I've always wanted to try it. It's actually kinda tasty. Were you and Yasin close friends? We gamed and trained together. They boys are saying Semion had something to do with it. He's Branco's boss, and he controls Lunden. But I don't get it. Something must've gone wrong. Where can I find this Semion? He's hosting a fight in two days. - We're going. - It'll be jammed with fucked-up guys. We can do this. I want to meet him. Right. Again. Again. Yes! Yes! That's it! Come! Great! Yes! Low! Awesome! That's it! Great! That's right! - Hey, what's up Hassan? - Hey, long time no see. Good to see you. - How's it going? Are you okay? - Sure, thanks. - See you in there. - See you. Now! Hassan, now! Get the hell out! Come on! We'll go over there. - Wassup, brother? - What are you doing? Long time, brother. What've you been up to, man? You smoke too much weed. Aren't you eating? What the fuck is up with you, man? - What are you doing in my club? - Looking for work. - It's a sick match. - He looks insane. So, about the work thing. What supermarket do you wanna work at? - Come to the weed joint. - No. Relax! Go buy some clothes, bro. Eat something. Hey, Hassan! Hassan! Hassan! Kick him! Hassan! Hassan! Hassan! Hassan! Hassan! Hassan! This is his bottom. - There? - Yes. Push a little harder. - Okay. - We'll do like this. We schedule a new appointment ten days from now - - and if he hasn't turned around by then, we flip him. - How do you flip him? - We sort of push... Hi. I apologize. - Hi, Zaid. - Hi, Lisa. - Uhm, Ulla. - Ulla, of course. Sorry. I was just telling Stine that he hasn't turned around yet. We should make it a new appointment in ten days and see if he's done it by then. - What if you can't flip him? - Then we should discuss a C-section. - He still may turn around on his own. - Please let Ulla handle it. Come back in ten days so we can see if he's turned around. - Can I do something to help him? - Nothing. Just enjoy your pregnancy. - I'm sorry, honey. - I don't want to argue here. Come on, honey. I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. - Sorry for what? - That I was late. Nice. Listen. I'm trying to stay positive and understanding... But I need you as well. Being late like this isn't okay. No, it's not okay. It's just crazy-busy at work right now. - Why are you smiling like that? - Because I shouldn't! You know me. Inside I'm full of remorse. I'm sorry. Let's go out to dinner this weekend. Shall we do that? A steak for my steak? That couldn't have hurt. What kind of vest are you wearing? - I have to get back. - Yeah. - Bye. - Bye. Zaid, I managed to hack his phone. Zaid... Give me that. Go on, hand it over. Try this. See if it fits. Breathe. Nothing happened. This might happen on the streets. Breathe. What if it had penetrated it! You have to be able to take a bullet without whining. Get up. - Don't point it at me! - You're losing it. Don't. Hey! What the fuck's going on? What's going on? Where's Semion? We'll have it with green beans, chilli fries and sauce béarnaise. Beans, chilli fries and béarnaise. Excellent. And beverages? - Red whine? - No, thank you. - One glass of red whine, please. - Any preferences? What would you like? I'd say a Pinot Noir. Pinot Noir is an excellent choice. Very nice. Thank you. - Maybe just a sip... - No way. I offered you a glass. But I can't have a whole glass. Just a little sip. You'll take a pregnant sip, and there'll be nothing left. What do you mean? My boys! Have you been a good boy? How's it going? You look happy. - Cheers, sweetie. - Cheers, honey. Let's drink to a good week. Order whatever you like. The money never runs out. This isn't a circus. Do you think I need you to clap at me? - Two of the usual. - Right away. Ice and mixed merchandise, okay? I was thinking... after the baby's born - - maybe we could.. take a trip. Take a trip? Where did that come from? My wife. She suggested I take some time off. - Sounds like a wise wife. - Amazingly wise actually. We could go to Japan or... - Japan? Why Japan? - I've never been. We'll be the couple with the screaming baby on the plane. - 300 big ones, my friend. - May I see? - Good job, man. - Wild. Or we could go to Berlin. We could drive there. Or take a flight. We've had some good times in Berlin. Or Paris... No, I miss our Berlin apartment. We shouldn't have sold it. What do you think? Do you miss Berlin? Hey... - Where are you going, honey? - To pee. Maybe you'll want to be part of the conversation when I return. Are you gettin' everything? Listen, you fucking fag. Why are you staring at me? Can't you just eat your fucking steak, fucking ape freak? Why are you so high and mighty? Can't you handle one of your own dining here? One of my own? They're actually not bad, these beans. Let me tell you something. Spending fuckin' 1600 kroner here once a month doesn't make you a big man. Who are you? I come here all the time. That waiter is my personal slave. I make ends meet around here. You forgot your roots. I remember you. I make sure that ends meet in the place you're from. Those who are not my brothers, I still treat like brothers. Those who had no brother, now have a brother. Those who had no door... I gave them a door. Those who didn't have a light... I gave them light. I open a club for them. I sponsor their soccer team. I make sure they can pay their rent. What do you do? When did you last visit your mother? When did you last do something for someone in the neighbourhood? I don't give a shit about you and your white world. At least I'm living in the place I came from. I am where I come from. You couldn't even be there for your own brother. Hi. Sorry I took your place. We've never been introduced. Hi. - Hi. - Semion. It's nice to see you're starting a family. Nice. - How far along are you? - Eight months. Congratulations. Fucking awesome job. I'll send over some champagne. Congratulations. One of Yasin's friends? We're leaving. Come. I'll fuck you up, you little hoe! There he is. About time. - Is everything okay? - Nice and easy. - Is everything okay? - Yeah. You? - So why are you dragging us out here? - Cool it, okay? Some fucking rat bastard is trying to off me. - Who? - That's what I'm trying to find out. That's why you're here. Maybe you have some information - - or tell me if I've crossed you. Tell me now. - But nothing happened. - Only thanks to my car! - So why are we here? - Am I hitting a nerve? You show up shit-faced and accuse us of trying to off you. What's up with that? It's called precaution, brother. People sneak up on me and try to waste me! If it doesn't hit a nerve, don't worry about it. - But if you know something, say it. - Are you saying it's one of us? - I'm just asking! What's up with you? - Are you sick or something? If I was in fucking coffin, I'd be sick! - Are you saying it's one of us? - Are you totally mental? Why do you feel so threatened by this? Run! Everyone, run! Run! Run! Run! Where is that little rat?! Find him! What the hell, man? Hello! Find that little hoe! You see what I'm dealing with? Now ask me if I'm mental! - Hey. - Hi Anton. We did an echo. It looks like mitral insufficiency, so... Shall I call an anaesthesiologist? - Zaid? - Yes, he needs surgery. - Who'll be assisting? You? - Yes, me. Lets get to it. Zaid. Have you talked to the parents? - What? - Have you talked to the parents? - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. Your son has sustained a powerful blow to his ribcage. It's pushing on the right side of his heart. It's pushing on one of the valves. So it's a complicated operation. Aren't you the son of Nidal? Yes. We're grateful that you'll be doing the surgery. Treat him like your brother. - I'll do everything in my power. - Thank you. Initiate cardioplegia. Scissors, Ulla. Forceps sign. Scissor sign. What does this mean? What's this? Scissor sign. How long have you been here again? Hello? Hi, mom. Hi, mom. Okay. Okay, okay, I'll stop by. Okay, Mom. - What's up, white man? - What's going on? - What did you say? - I said: What's up, white man? - Hey! Hey! - Are you okay? Well? Well?! What were you gonna do with this? - Look at me. - Zaid. Look at me. Want to shoot me? Let him go, Zaid. Let him go. Let him go. What are you doing? - They're.. - What? They're fucking little kids. - I have to go see my parents. - No, you don't. They know who you are. - I have to go see my parents. - You have to run! Now! Run, Zaid! Come on! Come on! I can hear you. Hi, honey. Why are you sneaking in like that? - What? - Why are you sneaking in like that? You were sleeping. I didn't wanna wake you up. Do you take me for a fool? No, sweetie. I don't. - Zaid, what are you doing? - Working. You haven't been at work. Where do you go at night? Yasin died, Stine. Do you understand? They took my brother from me. Yes. It wasn't your fault. What happened to Yasin isn't your fault. You do understand that, right? Please tell me you're not involved in all that stuff, Zaid. Please tell me you're not... The police... Shut up about the police. Don't talk about the police! Please? Zaid, we're having a baby. I need you! I need you here! Zaid, don't answer it. - Alex. - Zaid! - Zaid! Don't... - I can't hear you. Zaid... Zaid, if you leave now... We'll do this later. Alex. Hello? Alex. Careful. Careful, Alex. You're talking to a doctor. Never mind who. I have a severely injured patient. His airways are secured. He's breathing on his own. Skull fracture and multiple injuries. I need an emergency medical vehicle and a primary ambulance. The address is Hennings Torv 8, 3rd floor, 2620 Albertslund. Understood? Good. Who did this? - Semion. - Semion. Alex, did you tell him about me? - I... can't remember. - Okay. Hey. Hey! Hello! Police! Hey! Stop! Police! - Hey. Do you have headlights for a 208? - Sure, I do... Sit him up straight. Grab his phone. Fucking little rat, man. Hey. Psst! Look at this. Do you see this? Where is Semion? I don't know. Branco knows. He's the only one who knows. I don't know. I swear. What's up, Semion? We have something to celebrate. We'll blow a month's pay. Not much. I just had some food. - Say goodbye. - I'll call you back. - What are you doing? - Get in the car. Calm down. Don't fucking play smart with me. I'm getting in. Come. - Go. - Where are we going? You have to tell me where we're going. - To Semion's place. - Who the fuck is Semion? - Just go to Semion's. - Tell me where. - To Semion's. - I don't know any Semion. - Hello, relax, man. - Any other questions? - Take me to Semion. - We'll figure something out. Relax. You're a cold bastard, huh? Nothing to come home to? - Don't you have a wife and children? - Shut up. Shut up. I have two kids, brother. And they expect to see me tonight. So calm down. You're a reasonable man. We can talk about this. You may have two kids, but that doesn't make you a dad. You're just a bum who fucks up their life, so shut up. Go to Semion's place. "I forgot your address, brother." You come to my home, you rat? Dirty little rat invading my home! Get up! Get up, I say! You fucking rat! Get up! Is that all you've got? Well? So? Want more? Is this all you've got? Huh? Still not enough? I'll kill you like I killed your brother! Do you really want me to kill you? Get up! Sorry! I had nothing to do with it! Sorry, sorry, sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry... Sorry! Sorry! Push down here. Push here. Push here... Can you hear me, Anton? I'm on my way to the hospital. I have a boy with a gunshot wound. He's lost a lot of blood. We'll be there in five minutes. Zaid for God's sake, what happened to you? Come here. - Grab on. - A GSW to the abdomen. I stopped the bleeding. Zaid. Zaid... Zaid! Stine had the baby! She's here. Zaid... No! Don't go that way! Go through the tunnel. Take my card. Zaid... Room 13, 5th floor! Hey! What are you doing here? Zaid, police! Hands to the sides. Walk out slowly. Zaid! Arms out to the sides. Hands out at the sides. Lie down on your stomach. Palms up. Nice and easy. Nice and easy. Bring him in.
