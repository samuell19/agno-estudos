When's the last time you tried to hurt yourself? Um... Uh... I guess, like a few months ago? So I don't know, I just... Are the pills helping? The new ones, yeah. I can sleep at least. But, um... I don't really think they're helping with the dreams. What happened to you this week? Nothing. I... I dunno. Nothing? You got a summer job. My parents told you. Tell me about it. I'm gonna be a counsellor at this camp where Lacey works. It's like, four and a half hours up north but looks really beautiful in the pictures. On a lake? Yep. What are you writing? You think it's a bad idea. Jillian, I think... Look, like your parents do, I have concerns. I'm fine. Really I... I think it would be really good for me actually. I think it'll be good. You have a lot of fun as a camp counsellor. You will have fun but being a counsellor is a serious, big-time responsibility. You're not just a baby-sitter. Right? Kids will look up to you as a big brother or big sister. Their lives are in your care. And, uh, okay this summer we have just one new counsellor joining us. Huh, try that again. Everybody this is Jillian. Hi. And um, everybody knows about boat safety right? I called top bunk before you got here. That's not fair! It's camp rules. But you'll learn them. Thanks for helping me get this job Lace. No probs, I just lied to Fred, told him that you've been camping your whole life. Awesome. You know, I'm really psyched to hang out again. Me too. Welcome to the family. Handbook, schedule, list of your campers. How's your tour guide? The best. She said some good things about ya. Thanks for hiring me. Find Terry in the lodge, get a t-shirt and shorts. Tomorrow morning I'll take you over to the island for your solo. What's that? Two nights camping by yourself on our island, mandatory for all counsellors. It's really easy. Parents like to know that the kids watching their kids have some experience. Sound good? It's all nature preserve. Yeah, there's no hunting or fishing or anything. It's just us basically. I um, I'm Marty. Hey. Yeah. I have to, uh, take your picture before you go to the island. Smile. So, uh, dad says that you've done a lot of camping? Fred's your dad? Mmhmm. So you're not worried about your solo? No. All right, well, there was this one counsellor, uh, Britney, about three or four summers ago. She got so scared on the island that she actually lit off a flare. Of course, nobody saw it and the next morning when dad went to go get her, he found her treading water in the middle of the lake. What happened to her? She didn't get the job. And now we all make fun of her. No, I mean why was she so scared? Well, there's a legend of a ghost on the island. But, some people just get scared. I'll see you. "Boy is peddlin' all a, girl is swimming all around." Kaya! And then you yell 'kaya' at the end but you'll learn it. So tell me about the island. Well, it's surrounded by water. That guy Marty said there's some legend. You know we call him "Martian", and he's like his dad. Why do people get so scared? Can you turn that off? I like to know things... Okay! Okay, mercy. Okay. So there's this story that, like, thirty years ago these counsellors went on a trip with their kids, and when they went to bed they were all there, accounted for. And when they woke up in the morning, this one little girl Janie was missing. That's the legend? And some people say Fred was a counsellor when it happened and now obviously Janie haunts the island. Hey, lights out guys. Flashlight? Yep. Food? Yep. No camera, no cell phone. Not a lot left in her. Your tasks. Make fire, make camp, so forth. You need this. Gear in the bag is yours too. That's just a precaution. Who's that? Good question. All right, two nights and then sun up I'll be back to get ya. Right here. Drop that. We have to get back for the campers. I don't wanna scour the island looking for ya. That path leads to a clearing where you can pitch. Need me to show ya? Uh... By all means, take the help. Hold up. This'll do. Make 'em last, keep 'em dry. Hang your food up, it's obvious. You know all this stuff. It's in the handbook. I'll tell ya something. Yours is the last real solo here. What do you mean? I had to sell the land past the stream to a developer. They break ground soon. Won't be like this again. Camps don't make a lot of money. That's not why I do it. I learned a lot about myself out here over the years. Out in the woods. No. You stay here. Right. Sorry. I'll be back before you know it. Luxury. Hello? You in? Jillian? Fred. Is that you? Um, yes? Did something happen? Nothing, I was just... God damn the radio is for emergencies only. Is there an emergency? No. Get outta your tent. Enjoy the nature. Oh shit. Hey. He's harmless. Say hello to the girl, Bear. Well you seem okay. Excuse me? You called for help. No. I heard it. Wasn't me. Hm. Well look, we were just fishing up there. Heard somebody yell for help. Sounded like a girl. Is anybody else up here? No, just me. Hey, you're bleeding. Oh, it's fine. No... Got some bandages in the boat. No really. It's fine. You shouldn't leave it like that. How long you here? I'm uh, I'm going back to camp today. Soon. Oh, is there a camp nearby? Yep. I'm a counsellor. Almost. Okay, uh, well... You okay? Everything's okay? Yeah. I'll get outta your hair then, and uh, get back to gettin' lost. Nice meeting ya. Um, actually... I probably could use some help. Yeah? Come on. It's not far. Watch your feet. It hurt? Yeah, a little bit. Just be careful. Bear! Okay, here we go. What's your name? Jillian. I'm Ray. Nice to meet you. Thought there was no fishing on this lake. What are you? Lake authority at your age? How old are ya? Seventeen. Huh, what I wouldn't give to be, uh, seventeen again. Oh, I can do it. All right. Here, they make these things so damn hard. Okay. Yep. It's pretty bad. Sure you didn't hear nothing huh? No. I must be going crazy. Well, there's a ghost on the island, they say. Yeah, who says? Kids? Kids can be cruel. You know uh, I'll be... I'll be coming back here, I could get you a ride later. Oh, I'll... I'll probably already be gone. All right. Well, I better go find, uh, man's best friend. Bear! Stupid dog. Maybe he found a ghost. No. Wake up. W-wake up. Wake up. No. Wake up. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Hello? I can see you. You can come out. Who the fuck is out there? I'm radioing the police. Janie. Whoa whoa, hey, hey, Jill... Jillian! It's just... it's just me. It's Marty. Just chill out okay? What the fuck are you... Why are you here? Just to see you. I took a canoe. Why? I'm... I'm sorry. Look, it was a bad joke. All right, a joke. I didn't realize you'd scare so bad. Oh, and please. Don't radio the police. You scattered my shit everywhere. What... scatter your shit? No. You didn't untie my bag? Nope, I didn't do that. Maybe you just didn't tie it very well. You're freaking yourself out because you're alone I think. No but... Yesterday I... I found this doll, you know, one of those classic creepy dolls? Where is it? It was in my tent last night. Hey, I swear. Do you wanna check my bag? Then where? Was it Janie's doll? All right, I should go. No... No, no no... I'm not even supposed to be here anyway. I'm actually getttin' kinda worried that you're gonna light the flare. Please can you just stay? I... I'm not crazy. Hey I brought beers if you want one. So, Lacey told me the Janie story is true. That your dad was a counsellor at the time. Uh, yeah, he was. He was on the trip. Some of it's true I guess. Just not the ghost shit. No, that's just you. So, what actually happened then? Well, he doesn't talk about it. It's still a bit of a mystery, but I think they decided that she must have drowned or something. But definitely fucked him up. Honestly I'm surprised he didn't sell the island sooner. When he was drunk one time... after I had been bugging him and asking, and kept asking, he finally told me that Janie was a sleepwalker. Yeah, she wasn't even supposed to come out on the trips but, everybody felt bad, so my dad figured out how to rig up a tent so that it would stay shut so that she wouldn't get out so she could come. But she still got out somehow. And after dad took over the camp, that's when counsellors had to do solos. It was here. The hell is that? Hey, is anyone in there? Hello? Marty! Keep an eye out. Look! Whoever's tent this is was in mine last night. Come on, we should go. I have to see this. Jill! I have to see... Jillian! Stay there. What is it? Marty look at these! What are you doing? Marty! Let me see. This is at camp. This girl is in every photo. Look who it is. Hello? Hello, Fred! Whoa, whoa, wait! This is Jillian. Hey... we don't know what these mean. Someone's on the island that shouldn't be... STOP! Is that your tent? Look, listen, I think... Why do the other counsellors call you "Martian"? What? Why do they call you "Martian"? I heard what you said and I don't know! 'Cause you like watching girls? Taking pictures? No! Stay there. Stay there! I think it's my dad's tent. Look! He's the counsellor on the right. He did say he liked spending time up here. He's a drunk, he... he... He disappears sometimes. He's messed up. Oh my god. The doll. Please keep this between us. It's Janie's doll. You should come back to... No... I'm not going anywhere with you... No. No! You need to come with me! Jillian? Who is that? He stopped here yesterday, he... he was fishing. What are you still doing here? What's going on? Why are you on this island? Jillian just came through on my radio. Well, this is camp property. Are you okay? Did... did he do something? Hey, hey. No. Someone's staying here. We found this tent and all these photographs. Well, do you have any reason to believe you're in danger? He was in my tent last night. Who was? He was? We don't know... no. No, no no. We don't know. I saw somebody. Or at least, I think I did. Who? Couldn't make it out through the trees. Just a few minutes ago and it was coming in, it was like... about where the creek goes through. That's where the tent is. Okay, why don't you go... go back and I'll go take a look. No. I'll go with you. No, wait, wait... No no no. No, I'll show you where the tent is. Are you okay being alone? Okay. It's this way. All right. Come on, signal. You look familiar to me. Oh yeah? Glad I was close by. You hear that? Jillian! Jillian! Jillian! Your friend! What happened? Huh, he... we were going after the stream and I was looking into the forest and he... He hits me in the head with a fucking branch! What? Oh my god. Aah. Where's Marty? Aah, I don't know. Who is this guy? Do you know him? Why is he doing this? I don't... I don't know! It could be someone else. You saw someone else? Maybe? All I know is we gotta hurry. You gotta get your stuff. You gotta get your stuff. I gotta get you outta here. Ahh. Hurry up please. Let's GO! Now! Marty. You all right in there? Almost ready. And bring those pictures you found. Hello? Oh, thank god! You can? Okay how long? Someone's coming from camp. To take you back? You're on your way? Yeah, I don't know. Marty just went crazy and he hit some stranger and now he's on the island somewhere... Yeah, I'm scared. Okay, I'll stay on the phone. Wait if you want but they won't be long. I don't think I should leave you... Yeah, I'm still here... Really, it's fine. All right. As long as someone's coming to get you right away. Then I'll go put a bandage on this. Yeah. Thanks for your help. All right, be careful. Help. Help. Help me... Marty. Oh my god, Marty! Marty! Marty! Oh my god! Marty, you'll be okay. Shoulda done this last year. Shoulda come in when I had the chance. Here... Yeah, this thing... I'll find you. Shh! Shh! Please... All right, try some more. Just keep tryin'. Gonna be fine. Just keep tryin'. Okay. Okay, okay. Argh! Hugh! Argh! Urgh. Where are you? I can't do this. It's okay. It's okay. Okay, okay. This island's big enough if we just stay here, he can't get us in the dark. Then at sun up, Fred's gonna come get us and we're gonna be fine, okay? We're gonna be fine. We just need to last the night... Go away! Fuck off! Shh! Play dead! It's okay, it's okay. Shh! Shh! Shh! Bear! Shh! Shh... shut up! Play dead! Play dead. Please just play dead. THUNK Bear! Marty? You'll be fine, okay? You're gonna be fine. Bear! Marty? Hello? We need help! Fred, anybody? Please! There was a man here! My friend's gonna die! Please help us! We need help! Come here! Come here! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! You know you talk in your sleep? You had a bad dream last night. I had bad dreams. Mmm, and a bad memory. You wouldn't believe how many holes I've dug this summer. I haven't found nothin'. Please. Please, please just leave us. Please. I wanted to, okay? I wanted to. I did my best. But I can't. It's too late now. Marty? Wake up! I know you were a counsellor when that girl disappeared. Is that what you dream about? My sister drowned last summer in our pool when I was babysitting her. I had my friend over and I wasn't paying attention. You think that you need to be punished but we don't. Don't! Jillian. I dream about getting caught. No! No! No! Supposed to get help from that dog... find the body but he's gone and disappeared. You hold that. Turn around. Turn around! Now walk. Walk. To the water. No! You went right to the water. You wanted to swim. Step in the water. That's when you woke up. 'What, what?' 'What's going on?' 'Ah!' 'What are you doing?' 'Help me!' 'Help me! Help me! Help me!' Help! Help! Help me! No! No! Please! Please don't do this! Please! Please... please please don't do this, you don't have to do this! I can't stop until I find you. No! You buried her. You... You buried her. You can't remember where you buried her! No I can... I can help! I can help you! What did you do after you dragged me here? I can help you! I can help you remember! Ah yes. Yes. I... I can help. I strangled you in the hole... No! No! I remember. I remember where I put you. Fred! Fred, wait! Fred! Fred! Oh. Don't die on me now. Fucking christ. Jillian! Ah, ugh! Jillian! Jillian! Help! Help! Help! Jillian! Who's that there? Fred. How long has it been? Twenty-five years? Ray? It just, is so good to see you bro. Where's Jillian? Who's that? She's a counsellor. Staying here. I haven't seen her. What are you doing here? Oh, I came back to town. I mean here. Can't you tell? I'm camping out. I thought I'd come back and see this place one more time and revisit my youth. Before it's uh... dug up and ruined by somebody else. Can't tell you how sorry I was when I heard you sold the island. This place? It's practically sacred. Yeah. Lots of good times, huh? Oh yeah. The best. Kaya! Oh the best. Just the best. Yeah, except... Not always fun. Help! Help! Buddy, you gotta let that stuff go. Let it go. It's unhealthy. Let it go. Help me please! Someone!
