LINET: Once upon a time, I would get lost in the woods and I would look for fairies and for elves. (BELLS JINGLING) There. (BELLS JINGLING) Hey. Where did you go? Come back. Can someone help me? Hello? LINET: Hello? Can someone help me? Hello? (GROWLING) (TWIGS SNAPPING) (PANTING) (GROWLING) Hello? (SIGHS IN RELIEF) Good morning, little Linet. Good morning, Grey Peter. And what would you be doing here? Looking for elves, actually. (LAUGHING) May I help you down, young lady? Even if you found some elves, they'd run away. Why? You think they wouldn't like me? No, but they'd be afraid of you. But that's ridiculous. Well, you're always getting in trouble, Linet, and they're afraid you'll get them in trouble, too. I'm not always in trouble. Oh, Linet. And what will Lady Jean say when she sees her daughter all tattered and torn? You should try staying home for a change and be a good little girl. A good little girl? And what's wrong with that? ♪ Good little girls never get lost ♪ Out in the woods ♪ Good little girls play in their own yard ♪ Witches and wolves waiting to spring ♪ Hide in the trees ♪ I know, but still it's hard ♪ Just ♪ Staying at home sitting around ♪ Playing with dolls ♪ Not with the world at play ♪ And when I'm lost in the woods ♪ A little ♪ Somehow I find my way ♪ I find new streams where I can wade ♪ Strange creatures tucked in every glade ♪ With all the wild ♪ Unexplored places to be found ♪ I forget the safe road around ♪ Though ♪ Sometimes I ask ♪ When I grow up where will I be? ♪ I hear a small voice say ♪ If I get lost in the woods ♪ A little ♪ Somehow I'll find my way ♪ Into the clear some day We're shelling beans now, not mincing them, mistress. Oh, she'll be back soon. Of course. Of course she will. (SIGHS IN RELIEF) PETER: You see? They're waiting for you. I see you lost a shoe. You've torn your dress. LINET: But I thought I saw one. An elf! I was sure this time. But now I'm not sure at all whether to believe in them or not. Trouble is, if I don't look, I'll never know. I'm sorry, Mother. I really am. I'll fix the dress myself. Of course. The thing is that I am worried when you get lost in the woods. But I love the woods. What would the elves do with you all scraped and dirty, hmm? Come on. She has no fear, that child. That's right. That's how I like her to be. That's how her father would want her to be. Yes, My Lady. But when Sir Percival was here there was no reason to be afraid. Now that Sir Godfrey's in the castle, no one is safe. Peter, I do not want to worry the child. I do not want to break her spirit with fears. She should not be afraid of her own uncle. He's her own flesh and blood. Hello, Jean. Hello, Godfrey. There's something I'd like to talk to you about. Do you remember what today is? St. Swithin's Day, I believe. Yes, St. Swithin's Day. My brother Percival left for the war on St. Swithin's Day. With his king. With his king. Seven years ago today. Never to be heard from or seen again. Is it that long? Madam, I would have judged from the devotion that you seem to feel for him that seven years ago would have seemed like such a long time. Percival is always with me. He's not with you. In my head, in my heart. His memory is with you. Yes, his memory. I remember him, too. But what I came here to talk to you about was that seven years have passed. You are free to marry again, by the law. Percival has no son and I must have an heir. There are many young girls you can marry. I don't want another young girl. I want you! You want me? I'm not so convinced that you love me. Love you? But I think what you're saying is that you don't love me. True. I love my husband. Percival. Percival is my twin. We were born moments apart. We are the same. The same? You're the same and yet very different. I'm sorry, Godfrey. I cannot forget that difference. The law may say I'm free, not my heart. Shall we go now? Jean! Why do you choose to live like this? Why do you dress so simply? Why have you cut your hair? You could live in a castle like a queen. Oh, Godfrey, you are the lord of the castle and you'd soon get a wife. You think it would be wise to have two ladies in a castle? There is only one lady who will ever live in the castle! The people in the village don't like Uncle Godfrey, do they, Mother? No. They are afraid of him. Well, I don't like him at all. Hush, child! Let her speak her mind. Fine. Let her speak her mind. No one else dares to. Why doesn't Uncle speak to me anymore, Mother? He is the lord of the castle. He has many things to worry about. Perhaps you remind him of something. Something he would like to forget, but he can't. Does this make any sense to you? Allen Owen. You haven't paid your taxes. How is that? Sir Godfrey, I beg you to hear me out. The harvest has been a disaster, as you know. My cow died giving birth and the calf died, too. But I promise... We don't live on promises or harvests, for Pete's sake. Put him in the dungeon until his taxes are paid. But, Sir Godfrey, my wife is ill and my children are small. How can they raise the money to pay for the taxes without me? If your taxes are not paid within half a year, then your land is forfeit. Take him away. (GRUNTS) Sick woman and children! Have you no heart? What did you say? I meant no harm. What did you say, peasant? Have you no heart? Hang him! In the morning! Lord, do not do this thing! You have no heart! (BREATH QUIVERING) Dagger! Did you hear what he said? He has no heart. (EXCLAIMS) Wolf into man, fast as you can. Get up, Dagger. (YAWNING) Did you hear that peasant? That farmer, Allen Owen, screaming, "You have no heart"? (CLICKS TONGUE) I'm getting soft. Could he possibly know? I sleep all the time. I mean, do you think they know my secret? That I gave up my heart and soul to possess you? To spy for me, to do my will, to kill. The power of the wolf. That's me. Or is it? A miserable creature I've become. I don't know myself anymore. I'm not really an animal. I'm not really a man. Will you stop it? I mean, it really is disgusting. It goes on and on and on. Go to the village and find out what the people are saying about me. They don't say anything about you anymore. Well, that's because they're all afraid of me. You see, that's right. They're all afraid of me. Not all of them. Who is not afraid of me? Hmm. I heard. What did you hear? Your own flesh and blood, the girl Linet, has no fear. My own flesh and blood? Uh-huh. Oh, you like those words. She'll be afraid soon enough. He has no heart. Do my will.

He spoke up to Godfrey and will pay with his life. Well, at least his wife will know where to find his body. What a life we've led since good Percival left for the wars. But who would have guessed the change in Godfrey? He used to faint at the sight of blood. Sickly lad, he was. (BARTENDER CLEARS THROAT) Have you heard? A bad wind is coming. A stormy night. We'd better lock up tight. Mug of ale, please. Talking about the weather, are you? Storms coming, are they? I like a good storm. Shakes everything up. Clears the air. Good night, my friends. (MURMURING) (HOWLING) (HOWLING) (GASPS) (DOOR CREAKS OPEN) I had a nightmare. I heard. Are you all right? Mother, when will he come? Your father? Soon. Soon, I hope. Sometimes I feel so afraid.

Such lovely hands. Your hands are so cold. Godfrey. Godfrey, I came to beg you. Oh! Oh, so there's a price for the loaf? Be merciful with Allen Owen. He's a brother of my maid. He's not a bad man. Allen Owen spoke to me with no respect. A foolish man, I know. Exceedingly foolish, but... Godfrey, be kind. Kind. One cannot rule and be kind. But for this one time. Please, forgive. Power is not for the faint-hearted. My Lady! A bargain. For your loaf, I'll spare a life. Guards! (WHIP CRACKING) (ALLEN GASPS) (GROANING) Is he all right? (PEOPLE CHATTERING) I'll send Linet to get Nanny Bess. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Bet you're angry with me because I forgot you yesterday. There, my pets. There. (PURRING) I won't forget you tomorrow. (KNOCK ON DOOR) LINET: Nanny Bess? Open the door and come in. Ah! Just the person I wanted to see. I have a surprise for you. Nanny Bess, there is no time to waste. Allen Owen has been hurt and you must come straight away. His back is covered with welts and bruises. But I have to find your present... Bruises, you said? Big red ones? I think I have just the thing. What? It's not here. Where did I put it? Maybe here? No. Oh, dear, dear, dear. In here? Oh, no. This should do it. Nanny Bess, he has green eyes. NANNY BESS: Yes, my dear. LINET: Oh, do hurry, Nanny Bess. I'm coming. I'm coming. This should do it. LINET: You've seen the fairies, haven't you, Grandmother? NANNY BESS: Often. Have you ever touched one? No, never. If you touch them, they disappear. Now, I want you to sit outside and wait for me. And sit still. Remember I have a surprise for you. Mother. (GROANING) My, my. What happened to him? ALLEN: Nanny Bess, I... NANNY BESS: Shh. Just you keep still and let me take a look at you. (NANNY BESS SHUSHING) (GOOSE HONKS) Hey. How did you get out of your pen? Come here. (LINET LAUGHING) (GROANS) (GOOSE HONKING) Huh? NANNY BESS: Linet told me you'd had a fall. What did you do? Jump from the top of the castle tower? Godfrey (GROANING) gave me 40 lashes. And for no reason. (GOOSE HONKING) NANNY BESS: Soon be better. (EXCLAIMS) (SPLASHES) What was that? Oh, probably Linet. And I told her to sit still. Linet! Linet! (SPITTING) One of these days I'm gonna kill that kid. Yes, Mother? Where have you been? You were told to sit still. What was all that splashing about? What splashing? No, never mind. How does that feel? Good. It feels a bit... I can't feel any pain at all. LINET: What is it? Something I made just for you. Kneel down, child. Now, don't distract me, for I must get this right. Hmm? Willow wool and thistle thread, guard thy wearer cloaked in red. Magic, weave a potent charm. Let ye nothing bring her harm. Guide her through the winding wood, for a woodland's daughter's good. Over meadow, field and farm, let ye nothing bring her harm. No one, nothing, bring her harm. It's so pretty. Must I always wear it? NANNY BESS: Oh, yes. But why? When you wear it, and only when you wear it, you might see a fairy. What a beautiful present. LINET: It's magical, Mother. Nanny Bess says if I wear it, I may see a fairy. Mother, please, you have to be careful what you say and do. People will say you're a witch. (NANNY BESS LAUGHING) No, daughter, no. Just because I know a few things, that doesn't make me a witch. But just to be on the safe side, let's keep it a secret. Promise? I promise. NANNY BESS: Good. Besides, I think I'm a little old now to believe in fairies. We'll see. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Here comes Red Riding Hood with our noonday bread. Good morning, Allen. Good morning. How are you feeling? Oh, much better. Thanks for asking. What's wrong, Allen? Oh, Linet. Sometimes it seems we work so hard and accomplish so little. But it's a beautiful day. The sun is shining brightly. (LAUGHS) And now we need rain. The fields are beginning to grow.

Good morning, Godfrey. Good morning, Jean. Can I offer you something? Yes. Your hand. I cannot give you what I do not own. I love Percival. Then you love in vain. He's dead. I don't believe that. You're stubborn. He's dead. He is not dead, Uncle. You must not say so. (SHOUTS) He is dead! (ECHOING) This is the last time I will ask you, Jean. The last time. He's alive! JEAN: Linet! Linet!

Well, you've landed on the moon and it's made of green cheese and belongs to an old frump named Molly. Welcome home, Percival. PERCIVAL: As I got closer to the village, the people appeared to be scared. Very, very scared. It's rumored that Godfrey has learned black magic. Well, now that I'm back, I... (SHUSHING) Be careful. Don't rush in. Why do you suppose that Godfrey has all strangers imprisoned? It's because he's afraid that you might come back. Godfrey is my brother. He loves me. No. I'm afraid he has no heart to love you with. What do you mean? Godfrey has so much power now. But he's paid a terrible price. He can't love you.

It's true. I don't love anything or anybody. You don't love anything, do you, Dagger? I love to run with the pack under a full moon. I love a romantic dinner by the sea. The two don't seem to go together though. Do you love these things or just want them? You don't know the difference, do you? Neither do I. Oh. I saw Allen Owen working in the fields today. Singing at the top of his lungs. (VOCALIZING) Happy as a lark. That's impossible. I followed him all the way to Lady Jean's. He could barely move. Yes. So how could it be? Nothing makes sense anymore. Without magic. Perhaps someone else in Weir has magical powers. What an awful thought. Find out who healed Allen Owen. And when you do... When I do? You know, it's easier to make people disappear than it is to make them talk. People don't seem to like me much anymore, Godfrey. Not true. Perhaps you've just lost the power to charm them, Dagger. Yes. Like you charmed Lady Jean. Lady Jean will be mine. But as for that little girl of hers, she is a nuisance. DAGGER: Good morning, good woman. Good morning, Lady Jean. What a fine day. God, I hope I haven't lost it completely. Good morning, Lady Jean. What a fine day. Why is that? Why? Well... The sun is out and there's a very nice breeze. No, I mean why are you so friendly and cheery? Oh, no reason. Why shouldn't I be friendly? I'd like to have some friends around here. You do have a friend. Godfrey of Weir. Isn't that enough for you? What do you want from us? Nothing. Nothing. Just a friendly chat. Just a chat, is it? Well... You are such a beautiful woman and... Good morning, good woman. What a fine day. Can you just talk or can you be useful? Oh, useful, by all means. Then help me spread this on the line. Of course. I was very unhappy to hear what happened. Most unfair. Why, what happened? Why, your brother's whipping. I was very sorry. Oh, that. Yes. I thought it most unfair. It made you sad, did it? Yes. That's why I was so pleased at his speedy recovery. Oh, we're a hearty lot, my brother and I. Well, surely he had some special attention. Help me fold this dry one. Of course. Some special nurse? Stand still. Well, to be healed in one day. Amazing is what I'd call it. Like magic, you could say. Could you? Not again. No! (GRUNTING) All right. That's it. No more Mr. Nice Guy. KATE: Wolf! (EXCLAIMS) (KATE SCREAMING) Help! (WOLF SNARLING) (YELPS) After him! (MEN SHOUTING) (MAN SCREAMING) Are you crazy? You almost killed me! But where's the wolf? Did you see a wolf? That way. Sorry about that. MAN: Well, don't stand around, men. Get after him! (MEN SHOUTING) I've lost it. I have. I can't do anything right. First the mother, then the maid. (PANTING) Well, there's still Little Red Riding Hood. Poor little gosling, you've lost your mother. I hope it wasn't my fault. I only meant to play. Just look at her. So healthy and bright. Inside with you, child. There's trouble about. Still holding that gosling? Put it in the pen. What trouble? I... Wait. Godfrey has spies everywhere. He keeps a close watch on Jean these days. Why? He hopes to marry her. Then I shall... Hush. Stay calm. Don't be hasty. You've waited seven years. Surely you can wait a bit longer. (MEN SHOUTING) What's that? Did you see a wolf running? No. Didn't see one standing still, either. We scared it off good. I don't think he'll stay around here any more. Now what? Don't you see that it's Godfrey? PETER: My eyes are weak, but any fool could tell you're not Godfrey. Though you do have a resemblance to Godfrey. Same eyes. Same height. All the same, but not the same. Now, why should that be? (LAUGHS) What an old man I've become not to know my Percival. No, no, no. Grey Peter, no. You don't bow to the boy you taught all he knows. We must get you back in the castle, Sir Percival. We'll need some men. I'm ashamed of my fellows, but with you to lead them they won't turn and run. I should like to see my wife and child first. Oh, no. Godfrey watches Jean too closely, but I'll send for Linet right away. Linet. Linet? Linet! Where are you, Linet? I'm here, Mother! Linet, Nanny Bess is not feeling very well. I want you to take her some cake and cider. Yes, Mother. Now, you're gonna be a good girl. You're gonna go straight there. As fast as I can? As fast as you can. Morning, miss. Fine day, isn't it? Morning, miss. Fine day, isn't it? (CHUCKLES) Morning, miss. Fine day, isn't it? Indeed it is. Where are you going today? I'm going to my grandmother's to bring her some cider and cake. Oh. I happen to be going in that direction myself. Do you mind if I go along with you? No. I'll be glad for the company. Really? Do you really mean that? Of course. Huh! You're not trying to play a trick on me, are you? Why should I do that? Well, I have discovered that people are not always what they appear to be. People pretend a lot, you mean? Yes. Sometimes people pretend to be your friend when all they really want to do is hurt you. I think that's a very sad way of looking at things. You think so?
