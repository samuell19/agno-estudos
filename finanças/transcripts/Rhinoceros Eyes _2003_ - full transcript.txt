There was also a robbery, last night across the street, a womans prosthetic arm was taken. Do we get a prosthetic arm today? - No. - No, sorry. Well it looks like ahh... same suspect might pulled both jobs. Wow it's fucking ugly. Sweets, did your mother stealed some ones prosthetic arm last night? No, sorry i can't help you. Kinda looks like Tor Johnson. Tor Johnson? The wrestler. Maybe the greatest fucking wrestler of all times, and a very good actor. It was a giant and the horror... Yeah, but it's dead now so you're barking at the wrong pole there pal.. Hey, you know that mask we got Chep for Halloween, i think that's supposed to be Tor Johnson. A mask? uh? Who's Chep? Just this kid i got working for me. He's a good kid, keeps to himself, he wouldn't get mixed in anything like this. Besides he never leaves the place, I mean literally hasn't been out of here in... like what 3 years?. I tried to take him out one night, he just became scared and backed here so... you're wasting your time. How do you spell that... Chep? I don't know... With a "C". "H"? I woul'd go with a "C" Maybe you could tell me a little more about him. I'd appreciate it. Chep it's what you'd call... an idiot. - Idiot S... - Savant! Idiot savant. I only hire idiot's savant's. How long has Chep been working for you? - Few years. - Three years. He just sort of showed up with a load i bought at an auction. What do you mean? Well seems Chep lived his all life with his grandparents, and... quite tragically they died City auctioned all what they had - Which's some primo shit by the way. - Rather good stuff, still have it in it's own section. And when Chep came along with the delivery we just... sort of uh. Took him in. I's been here ever since He doesn't know he works around any more. So, it's all i've gotta say about that You think it would be possible if i spoke with Chep? Yeah go ahead. He's in the back somewhere. Yeah. Over there?
