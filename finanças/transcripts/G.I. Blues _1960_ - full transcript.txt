MAN: All right, keep 'em coming. MAN 2: Aw, either this ammo's getting heavy or I'm getting weaker. I got a mind to hand in my resignation. Aw, quit squawking. We got a steady job, haven't we? Room and board, lots of fresh air, good hours. What else you want? Only one more month of this for me. I wish I was out already. Oh, whoa, you drop that shell and we'll all be out. Pffft. Way out. Not bad. The first tank crew to reach the moon. Okay, men, come on. Let's snap it up. We move out at 0500. (big band jazz playing) * * * 1-6, this is 1-1. I'm in position. Out. Driver stop. Gunner, H.E. Up. Fire! On the way. Target. Cease fire. (rumbling) Fire! Driver, stop. Gunner, H.E. Over. Right, two, zero. Up 200. White shack. Identified. Fire! On the way. Just like it had eyes. You ought to see me with a slingshot. Okay, driver... back to base. Charlie Papa. Roger. Home, James, and, uh, through the park. (tank engine roaring) Hey, Sarge, anything new on Frankfurt? Yeah, we transfer there tomorrow. Hey, it's our last night here. How about getting me a date, Dynamite? Blonde, brunette, or redhead? Aw, he wouldn't care if she was bald, just as long as she wiggles. (laughs): You know it. Hey, Jeeter. Order just came through on Frankfurt. I got to talk to Cooky. I'll see if he's at the field CP. JEETER (on speaker): Pretty Boy 5, this is Pretty Boy 1-1. Over. This is Pretty Boy 5. Over. Is this you, Cooky? What's on your mind, pal? Frankfurt. Yeah, ain't it great? I just heard, direct. Yeah, it sort of changes our plans for tonight, though. The combo's gonna have to cancel out at the Rathskeller. I got, uh, other plans. Cancel out? But we were gonna break in some new numbers. Sorry, Cooky, but there's some, uh, cute numbers I have to break off with. I can't just leave without saying good-bye. For three weeks you try to get Mueller to put us on, he finally says, "Yes", and now you want to walk out waving bye-bye. Oh, I didn't say anything about waving. Cooky's right, Tulse. Like you said yourself: "Our careers come first." You win. I'll do my playing at the Rathskeller, but only until 10:00. Hey, Rick, while I was talking to Frankfurt, I picked up some hot news for you. Get this. Marla's there. Marla? In Frankfurt? Tulsa, did you hear what I just heard? (crashing) Is it raining there? I hear thunder. What's the matter up front? You blind? What do you mean "blind"? He hit it, didn't he? Well now, are we lucky? Oh, you're kidding. Oh, man, what luck. What are we gonna do? Wow. (jeep approaching) Oh. Here comes trouble. Okay, okay, chattering on the radio. And a thrown track. What happened? Sorry, Sarge. My fault. Of course it was your fault. You're the driver, ain't ya? Look, Sarge, he said he was sorry. Can't this army take an apology? What do you mean, "Can't..." She threw a track, Sarge. Tough job. Oh, shut up. Who would you like me to call, the automobile club? Oh, would you do that for us, Sarge? Ye... don't just stand there. Fix it. And this whole crew stays here till the job is done. Uh, Sarge, that's gonna make it pretty tough for me to fix that date up for you. Yeah, you better ride with me, Dynamite. (all talking at once) Somebody has to make out the report. (mimicking): Somebody has to make out the report. Good-bye. Good-bye. Good-bye. Dames is money in this man's army, huh, Tulsa? Don't look at me. I'm broke. Yeah, I'd like to be as broke as you are. TULSA: * What's she really like * The girl that you see me with * * What's she really like * The one I'm so dreamy with * Well, let me tell you she's wonderful * * She's marvelous and she's mine * * Talk about her kiss, she's all mine. * (making bubbling noises) Hey, Cooky? You know I was under that tank for four hours. If I ever come back in this army, I'm putting in for General. Not me. You're looking at a born civilian. Say, when am I gonna get that $300 you guys owe me? Oh, don't every day ask the same question, Sarge. You'll get it. I just don't happen to have it on me. No pockets. Ha-ha. Hey, somebody glommed my soap. I think we had it for breakfast. Hey, where's my soap? Throw me my soap! (thudding) Aw, cut it out. (Bavarian music playing) Tulsa. Hey, Fritzi. I borrowed a car from my Uncle Otto. We go for a ride later? Sorry, we gotta, we gotta play tonight, honey. Ja wohl. No, you don't understand. I mean, uh, here. But I have the car. Well, maybe after we're finished here. Keep your motor running, honey. You're in for a treat, Sarge. We're playing here tonight. Ain't she a beauty? Just look at that shape. That ain't the kind of shape I'm interested in. Where'd Dynamite? TULSA: Hey, Sarge. Hey. I see you got your pockets on. The gelt, the gelt. I'll take any part of that $300 bucks. Sarge, you've been very patient, so whatever problem Mueller gives us tonight, you get half, okay? I'll be waiting. COOKY: Hey, here's Papa Mueller. Bye, Sarge. Hi, Papa Mueller. Well, we're here. Ready for the audition, like you said. Boys, boys, I did not say "Yes." I did not say, "No.". But you did say "Maybe." The maybe's now no. I'm afraid to take a chance with beginners. But Papa, I've been trying to tell you, we're the hottest combo this side of the Rhine. Yeah. This could make you famous. You could discover the Three Blazes. And besides, you don't have to pay us much. How much? How much can you afford? Nothing. We'll take it. What is this? Shh, shh. We need the practice. If the price is nothing, I take the chance. Ain't we working kind of cheap? Think of the bright side: if we get nothing, then all McGraw gets is half of nothing. Oh, yeah. (low laughter) (dance music playing, crowd laughter) McGRAW: Dynamite. Komen zie in. Hi, Sarge. Well, we got one of each. Take your pick. At ease. Red's my favorite color. Come on, girls. Let's get a drink at the bar. Uh, vas ist, uh, your name? Britta. (song ends, applause and whistling) (drum cadence plays) RICK AND COOKY: * Hup, hup * Hup, hup, hup TULSA: * They give us a room with a view * *Of the beautiful Rhine * Hup, two, three, four * Hup, two, three, four * They give us a room with a view * * Of the beautiful Rhine * Hup, two, three, four *A-gimme a muddy ole crick * In Texas any ole time * Ahh... yeah, yeah * I've got those hup, two, three, four * *Occupation G.I. blues * Hup, two, three, four * Hup, two, three, four * From my G.I. hair to the heels of my G.I. shoes * * Hup, two, three, four Hup, two, three, four * * And if I don't go stateside soon, I'm gonna blow my fuse * * Yeah, yeah *We get hasenpfeffer * And black pumpernickel for chow * * Hasenpfeffer, hasenpfeffer * We get hasenpfeffer and black pumpernickel for chow * Hey, you're with me.

At ease. (cheering) Hey, look. Papa wants to give us some money. We just lost our amateur standing. Keep playing. I'll be right back. Yeah. You boys were very good. Thanks. You know, Pop? This is gonna help us get our own little nightclub back in America. As long as it is in America. Please, no competition. Good luck. Thanks, Pop. 40 marks. That's 10 bucks. 10 bucks added to 290 makes... My 300. Now wait a minute, Sarge. Why? Sure, Sarge. I just wasn't thinking. There it is, every penny we owe you. And Sarge... seeing that you did us such a big favor by lending us the money to buy the instruments, and get the combo started, I'm now gonna do you a big favor. What's this? Well... it used to be the Chili Parlor. But we're turning it into one of the hottest night spots on the Oklahoma Turnpike. That's the lease. Ricky, Cooky and me, we're opening it up as soon as we get out of the service. And Sarge... we want to make you a partner. Why? Well, because you're a good Joe, you're a regular fella, and, uh... why shouldn't you be a partner in a nightclub? A nightclub? With dames? A whole chorus line. And you can pick 'em and rehearse 'em. And rehearse 'em. And this will take care of your share of the lease. See you later, partner. * * I gave my heart * I gave my love * Oh, ho, my darling * I am true * Doin' the best * The best I can * But it's not good enough for you * * I tried so hard * So hard to please * Oh, ho, my darling * What more can I do? * Doin' the best * The best I can * But it's not good enough for you * * You know I was the kind who'd run * * Anytime you'd call * I guess I was the only one * Who didn't mind at all * I'll be a dreamer * I'll be a fool * Oh, ho, my darling * My whole life through * Doin' the best * The best I can * But it's not good enough for you * * You know I was the kind who'd run * * Anytime you'd call * I guess I was the only one * Well, it's one for the money, two for the show... * What are you doing, Mac? The kid's singing! So what? I want to hear the original. Turn that thing off! Turn Tulsa off! I'll turn it off, Cooky. Don't do it, Jeeter. * Do anything that you want to do * * But uh-uh, honey, lay off my shoes * * And don't you * Step on my blue suede shoes... * (cheering) Women and children first. MPs! Let's get out of here! Tulsa! Let's go! * Well, you can do anything... Here, Papa. This ought to take care of the broken pretzels. (glass shatters) Sorry, Papa. Sarge, you're making a smart move. Now your signature on that little paper makes you a full-fledged partner in our nightclub. I hope I'm not making a mistake. Oh, I almost forgot. We need 300 bucks. 300? A check will do. Are you nuts? You got 300 off me last night. Sarge, I'll try and explain. Signing the lease is just part of it. We need 600 to close the deal. And you being our treasurer... I resign. And give me my dough back. Now, now, partners shouldn't quarrel. What's that? Coming, Joe. I didn't hear nothing. See you guys later. Where are you going, Rick? I'm gonna buttonhole that guy who saw Marla. Tulsa? Can I throw you a few leads? Aw, you know I don't bother with used phone numbers? Did McGraw sign the lease? Oh, he signed everything, but he wouldn't come across with the rest of that dough. Oh, then what good is it? We need 600, and we've only got three. I know, Cooky, I know, I know. Hi, Dynamite. Hi, Turk. Hey, how are the frauleins in Frankfurt? Good pickings? Great for me. Which makes it kind of tough on you. Well, I'll take my chances. I followed you in Hawaii, didn't I? And I wound up with 12 hula skirts in my footlocker. Yeah, Dynamite batted 1,000 almost. Huh. It's that "almost" that separates the men from the boys. I suppose every time you went to bat in Frankfurt you stole home. Turk was knocked out of the box once. Just once, huh, Turk? You mean Lili? Yeah. She don't count. Who's this Lili? She's a dancer in the Cafe Europa. There ain't a G.I. in the Third Armored Division can date her. She's a real fooler. Steam heat outside, iceberg inside. Yeah? Well, I got 50 bucks that says I can defrost her. And I got 50 I'd like to double. I got Lili as far as the door. Let's see if you can make it inside, and uh, stay around for a few hours. Like, till dawn. Give me three days. I'll give you a week. That's a bet. Ten on Dynamite. I've got 20. I've got 300 on Dynamite. 300? Come on, come on. Anybody gonna cover it? Yeah, sure. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute! I want a piece of that. 50 bucks. Hey, but you're with us. Well, I know, but I'm betting against you. I think you're nuts. I'll watch out for your interest, Turk. Good. You can hold the stakes. Okay, okay, come on, come on. Hi, Padre! ALL: Hi, Padre. Just getting the names of some, uh, art galleries to visit in Frankfurt. Of course, of course. Oh, the Cafe Europa has some wonderful paintings. Okay, let's go! All right, men, across the street, on the double. Briefing from Captain Hobart. Let's move out! Hup four, hup four, hup four, hup four, hup four. Company halt. Right face. At ease. This won't take long. As you men realize, all of you are, in a sense, American ambassadors to West Germany. Your conduct during your tour of duty in Frankfurt is therefore of the greatest importance. There must be no black sheep among you, which I regret to say is not the case. Sergeant Bixby. Sir? Bixby, you're a good soldier, a fine soldier in every respect but one. We keep getting complaints from German fathers. But sir, I don't know any German fathers. It might be better if you did. So we at headquarters put our heads together, and the best answer we could come up with was to ship you to Alaska. But Captain, you can't do that! Who said that? We take off at 1000 hours. Fall in to entrain at 0950. Questions? Company ten-shun! Dismiss your platoons. Dismissed. Cooky, you better get over and see what you can do with Turk. Would you like a little sugar in your coffee? Two lumps. Gladly. Gladly. Turk, all we want is a fair shake. That's all. It's not our fault that Dynamite's being shipped to Alaska. What do you say? Okay, Cooky, I'll give you a fair shake. Thanks. Anybody in your outfit can make the play for Lili. Turk, quit kidding. Come on, Cooky. We're pulling out. I've got to get my gear. It's on board. What do you say? The bet's off? The bet's on. Good luck. You're gonna need it! You've got to help us out, Tulsa. We're on the spot. Now look, you guys, how many times do I have to tell you? With me, romancing a girl is a hobby, not a business. When I'm romantic, I can't think about money. Okay, okay. Who's second on the list? Jeeter. Jeeter? He's been married six times. Somebody must have liked him. I mean, maybe there's still a spark left. Let's go ask him. 300 bucks down the drain. Looks like I'm in real trouble with the Sarge this time. You're not the only one in a jam. There's Rick and me, our nightclub in Oklahoma. Everything. You just sent the Three Blazes up in smoke. Yeah, I guess I did. Thanks, Tulse. I knew you wouldn't let us down. Wait a minute, Cooky. I didn't say I'd take Dynamite's place. Of course you didn't. You're too modest, and that's just what we need. A modest, unassuming, gentlemanly type fella that can get his foot in a certain door and keep it there. I'll tell the gang. Hey, Rick, take over. Hey, fellas! You're nuts! You're nuts, Cooky. Hey, I found out where Marla's working. Good. Looks like you're in business. Looks like we both are. Fellas! Tulsa's going to take Dynamite's place! ("Frankfurt Special" playing) (train whistle blows) * Is this train the Frankfurt Special? * * Yah, yah, yah, yah! * * Now ain't this outfit somethin' special? * * Yah, yah, yah, yah! * * Well, we heard rumors from the bases * * Yah, yah, yah, yah! * * Frankfurt girls got pretty faces * * Yah, yah, yah, yah! * * Go, Special, go * Blow, whistle, blow * Frankfurt Special's got a special way to go * * Whoa-oh-oh... * Whoa-oh-oh... * * Now when we get to our headquarters * * Yah, yah, yah, yah! * * We'll be good boys and follow orders * * Yah, yah, yah, yah! * * Now don't take girls from one another * *No, no, no, no * Nah! * * They'll treat a sailor like a brother * * Yah, yah, yah, yah! * * Go, Special, go * Blow, whistle, blow * Frankfurt Special's got a special way to go * * Whoa-oh-oh... * Whoa-oh-oh... * * Round wheels singin' on a long flat track * * Clickety clack, clickety clack * * Boiler bustin' to blow its stack * * Clickety clack, clickety clack * * Towns and villages flyin' by * Fly by, fly by * * Farewell, fr uleins, don't you cry * * You'll soon get another G.I. * Now, come on train and get the lead out * * Yah, yah, yah, yah! * * Well, one more day we gotta sweat out * * Yah, yah, yah, yah! * * Frantic fr uleins at the station * * Yah, yah, yah, yah! * * They're ready for a celebration * * Yah, yah, yah, yah! * * Go, Special, go *Blow, whistle, blow (train whistle blows) * Frankfurt Special's got a special way to go * * Go, Special, go * Blow, whistle, blow * Frankfurt Special's got a special way to go * * Whoa-oh-oh... * Whoa-oh-oh... * * Whoa-oh-oh... * Whoa-oh-oh... * * Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh- oh-oh-oh-oh-oh... * * Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh... (train brakes squealing) (indistinct talking) What a welcome. Nothing. Who and what are you waving at? Oh, I don't know. What have I got to lose? Somebody might wave back. (motors roar) I was saving this stuff for my wedding night, but this is more important. Now listen, Cooky. If I'm going to do this, let me do it my way and don't put that smelly stuff on me. Any luck with Marla? No, the store won't give me any dope over the phone. I got to get over there before they close. Good luck, Rick. Good luck. Tulsa, how are you gonna break the ice with this gal? What's your angle? Charm, boy. Charm. I'll just walk up to her and say, "All my life, Lili, "I've been hoping to meet a gorgeous babe like you. Let's get over to your apartment." Huh? No, no, no, no, no. You got to be more subtle. Yeah? Well, how's this? "Little girl, I'm not one of those G.I. wolves "that hang around nightclubs all the time. Give me your key and I'll meet you at your place." Yeah? That's subtle? He's only kidding, Harvey. Aw, relax, you guys, I'll play it my way. Nice, clean, wholesome. Just don't get shook up. A-And look... I don't mind doing this for you guys, for all of us, but don't try to help me, okay? Okay. Okay. Let's go. Operation Lili. Europa, you're on! (horn honking) Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. There she is, Tulse, target for tonight. (whistles) Well, say something. Wow! Yeah, you said it for all of us. (car door closes) COOKY: Hey, fellas, come on. Come on and take a look. Wow, wow, wow, huh? (men clamoring) Oh, yeah! (whistling) (band playing slow burlesque jazz) Whoa. Whoo! MAN: Yeah. (band continues playing) (pianist performs solo) (entire band playing) (band continues playing) (tempo of music gradually increases) (music slows down) (music speeds up) (applause) She really cools a guy off, don't she? This might be tougher than we expected. It might not. Strategy-- that's what we need. Come to the manager's office. We'll fix it. Wine for Mr. Klugman on the house. I think I'll do a little reconnaissance work. Spread out, fellas. Give me room to operate. May I? Yes, of course. Thanks. Can I, uh, buy you a drink? No, thank you. (drum roll) Ladies and gentlemen. We have a request from an American colonel to hear a song from one of the soldiers in his command. Will Specialist Tulsa MacLean please come up? (cheering, applause) Better sing, soldier. Your loyal public is waiting. This might be the end of a beautiful beginning. (band playing fanfare) I thought I told you not to help. What did I do? (mimicking): What did I do? Wait till you get a load of this guy. He's a buddy of mine. Tulsa MacLean. Specialist Tulsa MacLean. Ring a bell? Huh? I do not believe I have ever heard of the gentleman. You haven't heard of Tulsa? ("Shoppin' Around" playing) * You got the huggin'est arms and the thrillin'est eyes * * You're just my style and you're just the right size * * Gonna stop * Ooh, ooh... * * Uh, shoppin' around * D-doo, d-doo, doo * * I'm gonna stop... shoppin' around * * 'Cause I found... the girlie I'm looking for * * Oh, the very first time you touched my lips * * Took my little red book and I tore it in bits * * Ain't gonna be... uh, searching no more * * D-doo, d-doo, doo * * I'm gonna stop... shoppin' around * * 'Cause I found... the girlie I'm lookin' for * * Ain't no other dolly I'm wantin' to hold * * Hey, yay, baby, I really am sold on you-ooh-ooh... * * Such a pretty little package I never did see * * Gonna wrap you up and take you home with me * * I-I'm thrilled like never before * * I'm gonna stop... shoppin' around * * 'Cause I found... the girlie I'm looking for * * I'm gonna stop * Uh, shoppin' around * I'm gonna stop * Uh, shoppin' around * I'm gonna stop...

(piano playing softly) She flipped her lid about you. She's waiting for you. Yeah? Where? Come on. Come on. Hey, where did Lili go? She wanted to get together with my pal here. I do not think so. She really flipped over me, huh? I think she must have flipped out of here. Now what? You tell me. Aw, look, we just lost the first round, that's all. Yeah, but you can get knocked out in the first round. You wish a drink? Yeah, arsenic on the rocks. Make that two. Two beers, I mean. Okay, two beers. Please, Miss Lili, be reasonable. Look, if I nearly drowned Herr Klugman, it is his own fault. No, I will not apologize. All right, all right, you will not apologize. But he is one of our best customers. Will it hurt to sit with him and smile a little? Tell Herr Klugman that I am very sorry, but I'm tired, and I'm going home. He will not understand that. All right. Tell him that I have a previous engagement with two American soldiers. You like anything else? You never know. Bene. Rome wasn't built in a day, and the way they put her together, I'm glad they took their time. I believe you said you were going to introduce me to your friend. Yeah, yeah. Tulsa, Lili. Lili, Tulsa. Lili. Hello, Tulsa. Uh, would you like to join us? Yes, please. Here you are, right here. Thank you. Pretty fast, Cooky. I've not seen you in here before. This is your first visit to the Europa? First time. Never been here before. Here you go. Thank you. Good breeding, fine manners. This boy could be in the diplomatic service, but he'd rather be a soldier. I enjoyed your song very much. That was your work before you were a soldier? Well, it might be when I get out. Uh, with Cooky here and another buddy, we might open our own club. Not that this boy has to make a living. No, sir. He's not one of those rich, spoiled playboys like other oil millionaire's sons. You'd never know he was sole heir to 100,000 acres deep in the heart of Texas. Now, look, uh, uh... Sorry. It slipped out. Tulsa here wants to make it on his own. Wouldn't take a nickel from his old man. LILI: That shows much character. Why don't you take a walk, Cooky, huh? Yeah, I guess I'd better get out of here before I spill the beans about your grandfather's railroad. (slow jazz music playing) I do not like it here. We shall go to some other place. Anything you say, honey. You won't get into trouble leaving here for the night? I leave when I want to. And I want to, now. Lili! Good night. Good night. Hey, don't you want to see how he makes out? Later. I got a little side bet going on me. Get going. Where are we going tonight, honey? I'd prefer it if you didn't call me "honey." Well, you didn't mind it inside. Now we're outside. But I got the idea you and me kind of hit it off. Ah. You and Herr Klugman have much in common. Eh, now wait a minute, uh, honey... No "honey." Look, if you and I are going places tonight... We are not going anyplace. You helped me get rid of Herr Klugman. Thank you. Now I'm going home. Alone. But we got a date. A rich young man from Texas shouldn't have any trouble in finding a date. I'm not a rich young man. (chuckles) Son of an oil millionaire. The closest I ever came to oil was draining crankcases at a gas station. Oh, and your grandfather's railroad? My grandfather was a brakeman on the Texas Central. (laughing) (chuckles) What's so funny? Come on, you poor millionaire. I'll buy you a drink, honey. Let's go. And when your friend mentioned the 100,000 acres in Texas, you should have seen the look on your face. Yeah, now I know why I lose at poker. (chuckles) You should see that Tulsa operate. Nice to see you, Lili. Oh, nice to see you. It's not like your music, huh? We play too slow? Uh-uh. No, it's just that we do it a little differently, that's all. But if it is too slow, it is, uh, dull, ja? Nein. Not if you're with it. Uh, the rhythm has to just sort of ooze out. Vas ist "ooze"? (laughing) Show him, vas ist "ooze." Okay, I'll show you vas ist "ooze." Ja, ja. Ooze.

(music stops) (applause) Das ist "ooze." Ja wohl. (chuckles) Very nice. Danke schoen. Would you like to go someplace else? Yeah, let's do that. He's off and running. (applause) Turk had her this far and got dumped in the stretch. It's on me, fellas. Auf wiedersehen. Let's go someplace where we can get some food. No music. I have a good idea. We'll go home, and I'll make you a nice Liederkranz on pumpernickel and some coffee. Oh, I wouldn't want you to go to all that trouble. Oh, well, if you don't... Of course, it would be quiet, and, uh, I'm very good at doing dishes. Okay. Liederkranz, pumpernickel and coffee. And for dessert, we'll get some delicious apple strudel. Hey, you are hungry. I'm a growing boy, ma'am. I'll get a cab. Oh, no, no, we'll walk. It's not far. And on the way we'll find a place to get some apple strudel. Well, thanks, ma'am. And, I don't like "ma'am." Neither do I, honey. You keep an eye on 'em, I'll call Cooky. Cafe Europa, please. Talk a little louder. What's the latest? Breakthrough. He's walking her home. She's gonna make him a sandwich. Liederkranz on pumpernickel. They're stopping on the way for strudel. Good. A man can't do his best work on an empty stomach. Three and a half hours to go. He better take small bites on that Liederkranz and pumpernickel. Oh, and, uh, you better leave word at the barracks where she lives. I may be a little late. You're beautiful, Tina. You had no trouble with the manager to let me off early? No trouble. I told him I was-a your cousin, Angelo. And he believed you? Why shouldn't he? You believe me, Tina, don't you? (chuckles) You know, before we go to the little night spot I mentioned, I want you to know something. I'm not that kind of guy. What kind of a guy you mean, Cooky? The kind of a guy you think I am-- smooth, tricky, a heartbreaker. You got me all wrong. But I believe you. They don't hand out these good conduct medals to just anybody, you know. Che bella, Cooky. Che bella, Tina. Ein taxe, bitte. (whistle blowing) Cooky, I think we have fun tonight. I love going to nightclubs. Personally, I can't stand them. What were you doing at the Europa then, huh? Well, I-I was lonely, Tina. A lonely soldier, far from home. I'm far from home, too. I come from Milano. Funny, isn't it? Here we are, two lonely people, far from home. Neither one of us with a cozy apartment to invite the other one to, where we could sit and read. Maybe listen to records on the grammafunken. I have an apartment. You have? But no grammafunken. No grammafunken? (clucks tongue) Who needs a grammafunken? We'll make our own music. Bene, Cooky. Danke schoen. The fraulein will give you the address. Tulsa, tell me more about Oklahoma. Oh, you've heard just about everything. But it's so interesting. Uh, your Indian grandmother, she was a full-blooded Cherokee? Smoked a corncob pipe till she was over 90, and played a guitar. She taught me how. That's strange. I thought Indians only played tom-toms. Oh, well, that's just in the movies. Now you take my Uncle Charlie. Leaping Bear, that's his real name. Now he plays the best hot clarinet that you'd ever want to hear. Ah, yes. Like in the movies. All Germans are submarine commanders. And all French girls are can-can dancers. Same thing. You know, uh, that, that's the trouble with people. I mean, if people got to know each other better, then they'd uh, get to know each other better, and everything would be better all around. Much better. You like my pizza? Oh, Roman hors d'oeuvres, it's no wonder Nero got fat. I'm glad you like. I make some more. Oh, not now. Let's, uh... let's talk a while. We talk. We talk about Park Avenue, New York? Where you come from. Oh, okay. What do you want to know, my little bambino? You make a mistake. Bambino, it's a boy baby. Oh, that is a mistake. Baby, you're no boy. Mm-mm. To live in Park Avenue, New York, one must be rich. Mm-hmm. Cooky, are you rich? Well, now, money isn't everything, Tina. Take me, for instance. Before I decided to make the army my career, the only girls I ever met were, uh, debutantes. Dull, artificial butterflies. Oh, they could play tennis, and ride, and raise beagles. But could they cook pizza? Not on your life. I cannot raise a bagel. Beagle. That's what I said, bagel. But since 12 years old, I can cook a pizza. Tina knows what a man likes. Oh, I could tell that the minute I looked at you. Cooky. I mean you're very understanding. You're a simple, understanding, Italian farm girl. I come from the city. My father is a butcher. Better yet. A simple, understanding butcher's daughter. Oh, Tina, I respect you. And I respect you. And that's what makes the world go round. Respect. Cooky! What, what are you doing here in, in Tina's apartment? Oh, but it's my apartment, too. We're roommates. Tulsa, I would like you to meet Tina-- oh, but of course, you already met her in the Europa. I'll fix the coffee and the strudel. Come help me, Tina. And how did you get here? It wasn't easy. You fouled it up again. What's he doing up there? Who cares? Look, the bet says Tulsa's got to be alone with Lili. Yeah, yeah, we know. I'm supposed to be alone with her. You can't be alone with Tina here. That's right. Get your hat. Lili? You break your rule, huh? For the first time you let someone in the apartment. Oh, but he's not like the others. He's so open and-and honest. Just like my Cooky. Lili? Oh, we'll have everything ready in a few minutes. Oh, I'm sorry, but we're going to have to beat it. Oh? Oh, what a pity. Well, Cooky here just reminded me that it's our first night in town, and we have to get back to quarters early. We're, we're due for passes tomorrow. We wouldn't want to lose 'em. I've got plans for us. Cooky. Tina, hand me a paper bag, please. I'll give you some strudel for the road. Thanks. Look, uh, about that pass tomorrow. Oh, if you get a pass, maybe we can take a trip down the river to Aschaffenburg. Oh, well, good. Ever since I was a little kid, I always wanted to see Aschaffenburg. Where is it? COOKY: Come on. We'd better get going. Okay, General. Auf wiedersehen. Arrivederci. I didn't know you could speak German. I didn't know you could speak Italian. Here's the strudel. Thank you. Auf wiedersehen. Auf wiedersehen. Arrivederci. Tina, you know something? In Oklahoma, Indians do not always play tom-toms. Lili, you know something? Before me, he only knew girls who raised bagels. Tina... Hey, Cooky, how did you get up there? I'm stupid. That's right. Why didn't Turk tell us Lili had a roommate? 'Cause you didn't ask him. Look, why don't you guys throw in the towel and let me pay off the bets? Because we're gonna win. Right, Tulsa? Right, tonight, reconnaissance, tomorrow, the battle of the bulge. Yeah. That's the stuff, Tulsa. You can do it. Tulsa! Hey, why don't you watch where you're going? What the... (laughs) Oh, hi, Sarge. Glad you dropped by. I'd like to talk to you about a pass this afternoon. No dice. As of now, you're doing guard duty. But it's Saturday. So it's Saturday. Hey, look, Sarge. Now this is important. It, it's for us. What do you mean, it's for us? Uh, well, if I can get off, I'm going to try to get the trio booked on the Armed Forces show for tomorrow. It'll be worth a fortune in publicity. For our nightclub, you know. Well, that's different, partner. Why didn't you say so? I guess I'm just stupid. Yeah. Sergeant... McGraw. Oh, thanks, Sarge. Oh, you better make one of those out for Cooky. Mm-hmm. Sergeant... McGraw. Oh, thanks, Sarge. And, and Rick, too. Uh, uh, they might want us to audition. Maybe I ought to go along with you, huh? Like you could say I'm your manager. We'd love to have you, Sarge, but, uh, they need you here. You run this man's outfit. I do? Yeah, yeah, I do. Thanks, Sarge. Thanks. (engine misfiring) (in rhythm with engine): Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina. You know, everything that moves reminds me of that girl. Of all the rotten luck. Huh? First I get transferred to North Africa for a year. And, when I finally get here, the landlady tells me Marla moves, and left no address. That's tough. (engine humming smoothly) You did it! That's all she needed was a little sweetening. Hey, a little sweetening. Yeah, that's it. That's how I get to her landlady. Thanks, Cook. Well, what'd I say? All right, men, knock it off. Three-day passes. For you. Oh, you're a pal. I can sure use it. How'd you wangle 'em? Never mind. I'll take it. Uh, Lili's picking me up at the gate in half an hour. You're doing real good with Lili. I think she goes for you. Yeah, but I can't figure what's the matter with me, Cooky. I mean, I'm not enjoying it like I should, you know, you know, with the bet and everything. Don't let it bother you. This is all very natural. You like Lili, and she likes you. And if your buddies can make a little money on the side, is that bad? Huh? I guess there's nothing wrong with it. That's better. (horn beeping) Good luck. Good afternoon. Hi. I like that better. "Hi." Hope I'm as lucky as he is. Yeah, I hope you are, too. There's our bus. Let's grab it. Ach, schoen vieder the soldier. Look, I want to talk to you about Fraulein Marla. I told you yesterday. Fraulein Marla does not live here anymore. She has moved. Where, I do not know. Well, maybe this will help you remember. Young man, if you give me one million marks, I still could not help you. But Mrs. Hagermann, I... Do not come back. You waste your time and my time. Marla? Marla? Where is this child? Marla! Yes, Mrs. Hagermann? He was here again. I hope this time he will not come back. Marla, only when you are in love can you be so angry with someone. Why don't you see him? No. He seems such a nice young man. I'm sure if he knew the circumstances, he'd... Please, Mrs. Hagermann, I do not wish to talk about him. Please. (baby cries) (baby fussing) Thank you. Do you have scenery like this in Oklahoma? No, ma'am. I mean, uh, well, we have Catfish Creek, and the Red River, and well, that's about it. (bell clangs) Come on. (bell clangs) Frankfurt-Am-Main is so called because it is on the River Main, which flows into the Rhine, which eventually flows into the North Sea. Wouldn't want it any other way. Ah. Observe this excellent example of ancient handiwork, uh, dated by the artist in the year, 1959. "Fritz liebe Emma." Liebe? For those who do not know, "liebe" translated means love. Oh, you don't have to explain that to a G.I., uh, that's one of the first words he learns when he gets over here. Ah, you too, Tulsa? Oh, absolutely. Like uh, "liebe that sauerkraut." I was not thinking of sauerkraut. Hey, here's another one. "Fritz liebe Dora." I have one too. Hey, "Fritz liebe Hilda." Fritz gets around. You know... you know, I have something to confess. Last night when I sat down at your table, I thought, "Uh-oh, another one to watch out for." And when you sat down, I figured, "Well, now, here she is, the gal I've heard so much about." Oh, I have a reputation. Yeah, but it's a good one. You're supposed to be a cold potato. A human iceberg. The original fisheye. Oh, please. So many compliments will go to my head. Pretty, huh? Ja wohl. (children shouting) Whoa! Apaches. (children shriek) What's all the excitement about? Circus in town? Oh, much better than that. A puppet show. Yeah? I've never seen one before. You know, it's times like this I wish I was seven years old. Well, come on. For a half hour we'll be seven again. (Ludwig talks for puppets in German) If the soldier really loves her, he'll never give up. Ten to one he chickens out. Bet? A bet. Ahh. (in a feminine voice): Papa, Papa. (in a manly voice): Ach du liebe. (applause) A happy ending. You win. (applause continues) Oh, it's not over yet. Now he sings to her. No music. Oh, it's a full orchestra. (music on gramophone) MAN (SINGING): * Moose-ee den, moose-ee den * * Zoom schtay till aye hin house * * Schtay till aye hin house * * Oon do mine shots blybst here * * Moose-ee den... * (gramophone winds down) * Moose---ee--den * * Moose---ee--den * (children laughing) * Schtay will aye hin house * * Oon do mine shots * * Blybst here * * Mein herz ist troy * * Mein lieb Blybst tray... * (laughing) Maybe I can get that thing going for 'em. You better. (gramophone breaks) Vas is los? Kaput. Kaput, huh? (groans) Kaput. Do you know this tune? Ja, I know. Do you think you can play it on your, uh, squeezebox? Ja. Well, what do you say we give it a whirl? We give it like you say, a whirl. I'll try anything once. (children clap) (singing): * Can't you see I love you * * Please don't break my heart in two * * That's not hard to do * 'Cause I don't have a wooden heart * * And if you say good-bye * Then I know that I would cry * * Maybe I would die * 'Cause I don't have a wooden heart * * There's no strings upon this love of mine * * It was always you from the start * * Treat me nice, treat me good * Treat me like you really should * * 'Cause I'm not made of wood * And I don't have a wooden heart * TULSA & CHILDREN: * Moose-ee den, moose-ee den * * Zoom schtay till aye hin house * * Schtay till aye hin house * * Oon do mine shots, blybst here * * Moose-ee den, moose-ee den * * Zoom schtay till aye hin house * * Schtay till aye hin house * * Oon do mine shots, blybst here * * There's no strings * Upon this love of mine * It was always you from the start * * Zy meer goot, zy meer goot * * Zy meer vee do vair blips zolst * * Vee do vair blips zolst * * 'Cause I don't have a wooden... * (knocking) *Heart. Oh! Ow! Oh! Ow! Whoa, whoa, oh. (cheering and applause) In front of you, the famous Niederwald. I would like to point out that the summit of the Niederwald rises 985 feet above sea level, 740 feet above the river. Uh, do these things ever break down? I mean, suppose we got stuck up there all night? Oh, no need to worry. Oh, I wasn't worried. I, uh, was hoping. I kind of like it up here. It's, uh, very cozy. The vineyards of the Niederwald have been in existence for over 300 years. Oh, you know, riding forward makes me dizzy. Oh, well, you'd better sit here. Ja, and, uh, I'll sit over here. Observe the neatness and precision of the grape fields. Tulsa, what are you doing? I just, uh, want to sit next to you, that's all. There, now, isn't that better? Much better. LILI (singing): * Rainbows * Rainbows... rainbows * I don't worry * Whenever skies are gray above * * Got a pocketful of rainbows * * Got a heart full of love * * Rainbows * Rainbows * Mr. Heartache * I've found a way to make him leave * * Got a pocketful of rainbows * * Got a star up my sleeve * * Rainbows * Rainbows * Kiss me extra tender * Hold me extra tight * 'Cause I'm saving your sweetness * * For a lonely night, aye * * Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye * * No more teardrops * Now that I've found a love so true * * I got a pocketful of rainbows * * Got an armful of you * Rainbows * Kiss me extra tender * Hold me extra tight * 'Cause I'm saving your sweetness * * For a lonely night, aye * * Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye * * No more heartaches * Now that I've found a love so true * * Got a pocketful of rainbows * * And an armful of you * Rainbows *Rainbows *Rainbows * Rainbows. * * Rainbows. * You're very quiet. You haven't said anything for such a long time. Didn't you enjoy yourself today? Yes, I did. Maybe too much. Tulsa? Yeah. So far, I've been making all the plans. Tonight after work, we do what you want. Come on, honey. (airplane flying overhead) You're so generous to buy me a ticket to Milano. I'll be so happy to see my mama and papa. Listen, Tina, I know what it is to be homesick, and, well, I can't go back to Park Avenue just yet, but I can certainly treat you to a visit to your family. Thank you. Keepen zie change. Come on, I don't want you to miss that plane. Well, it won't be long now. You are so sweet to do this for me. Oh, I'm doing it for myself, too. Huh? I mean, if you're happy, I'm happy. ANNOUNCER: The plane for Milano will be delayed for two hours. Cooky, you do not have to stay. You have been too kind already. How can I ever repay you? Oh, I'll think of something. Bye, Tina. (knocking) Come in. Hi. Hi. Well, my millionaire friend from Oklahoma. And where do we go tonight? Well, that's what I want to talk to you about, Lili. I, I'm going to have to break our date. Oh, you have no more pass? No, that's not it. I'm, I'm just gonna have to call off our date, that's all. Oh? I should have realized. You are a soldier. You can't possibly afford to take a girl out every night. No. It's nothing like that. See, I had a great time this afternoon. Well, so did I. And I, I've been thinking about it ever since. I-I like you a lot. I'm glad. More than a lot. I am more than glad. You see, a guy like me-- on temporary duty-- he meets a girl he thinks a lot of, like you. They go out together and they have a good time. All of a sudden, things start to get serious. Oh? And before you know it, somebody gets hurt. I don't want that to happen. I see. You've obviously given the matter much thought. I have. You're trying to tell me that it will be best for me that we do not see each other anymore? Yeah. Well, I guess that's it. Hey, Cooky. Tulsa. Hi, Tulse. Hi, Tulse. Have a chair. Sit down. Boy, have I got good news. No roommate tonight. I bought Tina a plane ticket to Milano. The coast is clear. Sorry, I just cancelled out. You what? Oh, no. You didn't tell Lili about the bet? I didn't tell Lili about anything, I just called off our date, that's all. There's no need in both of us thinking I'm a heel. You're off of your rocker. Look, Cooky, I'm going back to the barracks. The bet is off. But Tulsa, you... Nothing you can say will change my mind. Okay. Okay, so you were born with a decent streak. Iit's not your fault. Nobody's perfect. Sorry, fellas. A stein of gin. Vas? Ja wohl, ja wohl. Hi, Tulse. Hi, Mac. Hey, Rick's been trying to reach you. Left this number for you to call. Very important, he says. Thanks a lot, Jeeter. (thuds) Hi. Well, uh, what's everybody so happy about? Aw, shut up. What did I say? I got an idea. Don't do nothin' till you hear from me. Hey, where's he going? What are you guys planning? (knocking) Yes? It's me, Cooky. Well, come in. Cooky. I'm very pleased to see you. You are? Why, yes. I was just having a drink. Won't you join me? Yeah, I don't mind if I do. It's none of my business, you were going to drink all of this alone? Not all. Just a little. My morale is very low, Cooky. Mine, too. I was about to ask for a tranquilizer. This should help. (glasses clink) It's, uh, too bad about you and Tulsa. He's quite a character, your friend. I'm not used to men who break dates with me. I don't blame you for being sore at him. Oh, I'm not, uh, sore. I admire him. We'll drink a toast. (clinking) To a gentleman. Yeah. Here's to Benedict Arnold. You know, Cooky, in this business it's very unusual, and very refreshing, to meet a young man with principles. I shall miss him. (knocking) MAN: Your number, Miss Lili. Oh, yes, I'm ready. Will you excuse me? Of course. I got to join my gang, too. I wouldn't miss you number, Lili. Fellas, you're looking at a guy that just left a babe that is really carrying a torch. Now I'm giving it to you straight. The welcome mat is still out for Tulsa. (big bane fanfare begins) (applause) * * * (song scatting) (laughter) (bugle call over big band music) (big band music resumes) (scatting) (fingers snapping) (applause) (song ends, applause) Hey, Cooky, I thought you said Tina was on her way to Milano. She is. The roommate! She's probably been there and back already. These jet flights get faster every day. See you later. Tina, baby, you're not supposed to be here. Sí, I change my mind. Yeah, but you were so homesick for Milano. But then after you leave, I am homesick for you. And I miss my work. Oh, and I missed you too, Sugar. Right after you get through working tonight, we're gonna do the town. Just you and your Cooky. Oh, good, Cooky. Tulse! Come on in. Come on, come on. Glad you came over. Come on in the living room. What are you so shook up about? Now take your hat off. All right, sit down. Sit down. No, no, stand up, stand up. First, you got to have a cigar. Now you said this was an emergency. You didn't bring me over here just to give me a cigar, did you? I found Marla. I had a hunch you did. We're gonna be married. Well now, how about that? And you want me to be best man, right? Uh, no, we need a babysitter. A, oh, a babysitter? Marla! Hello, Tulsa. It's good to see you again. It's good to see you. Both of you. He's beautiful, no? He's beautiful, yes. But how, how did, I mean, who did...? uh, I don't know what I mean. Congratulations, Rick. Thanks, Tulse. You too, Marla. Can you imagine this little dummkopf not telling me? You know, I still wouldn't know if her landlady hadn't double-crossed her. Mrs. Hagermann is a very wise woman. Look, honey, Tulsa must have a million questions. Well, I, I... Sure you do. Look it. Tell him about your silly pride. How you ran out on me with a baby on the way. Uh... Without even letting me know. Honest, there's no reason... It was not pride. But when I received a letter from a young lady in America saying she's engaged to the man who says he loves me. Well, that was her story. Look, I already had a license to marry you. And the CO's permission. But I did not know. You should have told me. Well, you never gave me a chance. You were gone without a word. Now look, there's no reason... Tulse, I'm sorry. Go ahead. You must have a million questions. No, I... think you just answered them all. (chuckles) Well, look, we're making a quick trip to Heidelberg to use that license. (cooing) ! That's uh, why we need a babysitter. Well, I'm glad to help out, Rick, but there's only one thing wrong. The G.I. manual didn't brief us on this kind of an emergency. Oh, look, you'll have no trouble. If he cries, you just give him his bottle. Yeah? His formula's all fixed. But he will not cry. He's a very good baby. Well, good. I put him back to bed. (cooing) Good night, son. Good night, little fella. Say good night to him. Good night. Oh, I got to buy my kid a present. A bicycle? A bicycle? Sure, he's a boy, isn't he? Ah! Hey, what's his name? Uh... Junior. Junior, huh? Well, that figures. (chuckles) Oh, yeah. Ready, honey? Shh. He will sleep like a baby. Why not? He is a baby. (laughs): Well, we're off. Come back anytime. Oh, if you are hungry, there's some liverwurst in the icebox right next to the baby's bottle. Thank you. Take care. Oh, I'll do that. (cooing) (whistling) (baby crying) Air raid! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. (crying continues) Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Now just be calm. Calm, calm down. Calm down. That goes for both of us. (crying) Hey, hey, hey, hey. Now don't be scared. Don't be scared. (crying) Shh. Now your ma and pa will be right back. They just went away to get married. No, no, wait. Coochie. (crying continues) I'm your old Uncle Tulsa. Let's play, huh? Hey, look. Look, look. Can't say that I blame you. Hey, I know, you're hungry, aren't you? Well, we'll fix that. We'll fix that. (continues crying) At ease, at ease. Wait, wait. Shh, shh, shh, shh. You just take it easy now. You stay right here. You stay right here, and I'll go get your milk, okay? (crying) Now, just don't run off anywhere. Just don't... just don't run off. (glass breaking) (crying intensifies) Now see what you made me do? (imitates crying) I'll be there mach schnell. Enough. Hey! No, wait! Come on, you can't have that. Come on, now, give it to your Uncle Tulsa. Come on. Oh. (crying) Ah... Army manual, section 43. "When in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy, apply judo chop to the back of neck." Oh, if you was only my size, you little rascal. (crying) Come on, come on. Give it here. Milk, milk. I gotta have... no milk. (closes door) I gotta get milk. (crying) I gotta get help. You make more noise than a tank. Hello, get me the Cafe Europa, please. This is an emergency. (crying) (jazz music playing, indistinct conversations) Telephone, Miss Lili. Hello? (crying) Hello, Lili? It's me, Tulsa. Tulsa. What's all that noise? Oh, that's the baby. Baby? Look, uh, I don't want to bother you at work, Lili, but uh, you see, I'm babysitting for a buddy who just ran away to get married. And, and, and, and I'm in trouble. Oh, I know. You don't know how to change a diaper. Oh, I haven't even come to that problem, yet. I don't think I have. Uh, the bottle with the kid's formula broke, and, and, and he's crying, and everything, and he's going nuts. I'm telling you, Lili, it's an emergency. I was just leaving here, Tulsa. I can meet you in my apartment in about 20 minutes. We'll be right over. (crying) Good-bye. Come on, Tiger. Good news, boys. That was Tulsa. Tulsa? Once more, love is in bloom. You should have heard that honey voice. "I'll meet you in my apartment, Tulsa, in 20 minutes." Don't just sit there. Get going. Right. Operation Dawn Patrol. (crying) There you go. Hang on. Shh, shh. Just take it easy. I'm sure glad women have the babies. (baby crying, engine humming) (door opens) (door closes) (door opens) (door closes) What's he bringing her? It's a magnum of champagne, you dope. This boy thinks big. It's only 2:30. He can still be kicked out. He won't. Let's get some coffee. We got a long wait. (cooing) The tiger is quiet. He's a good baby. He's a time bomb. You never know when he's gonna go off. Oh, I'm only kidding. Nothing personal, Tiger. Uh, Lili? I-I'm sorry to bother you so late and everything, but, uh... uh, you were the first person I could think of. The only one. I'm flattered. I'm also very glad. I didn't think I would see you again. Yeah, that goes for me, too. Yes, sir, I'm sure glad I had to baby-sit tonight. Oh? You like babies? After they grow up. Coochie, coochie. (laughing) Hey, none of that "coochie, coochie." You just sit there. (cooing) I think he's getting ready to bust loose again. (crying) Oh... all babies love to cry. Sometimes because they're hungry, or teething, or sleepy. And I think sometimes just so they can hear a lullaby. Oh, I get it. Blackmail, huh? Well, certainly. Don't they have lullabies in Oklahoma? I don't like that look in your eye, Tiger. (gurgling) Okay, okay, I'm going. I'm just trying to remember the words. Lullaby. (cooing) * They call your daddy Big Boots * * And Big Boots is his name * It takes a big man to wear big boots * * That's your daddy's claim to fame * (light switch clicking) * They know your daddy Big Boots * * Wherever soldiers are * 'Cause he can handle an armored tank * * Just like a kiddie car * So sleep little soldier * Don't you cry * Loo loo loo loo loo loo loo * * General Sandman * Soon coming by * Loo loo loo loo loo loo loo * * I'm gonna tell you a little secret * * You won't believe it's true * Did you know your daddy Big Boots * * Once wore little boots like you * * Once wore little boots like you. * I guess I took care of that pretty well, didn't I? Uh-huh. (cooing) And as your reward, you can help me clean the kitchen. Hmm, KP duty again. (cooing) COOKY: 1:00 on the dot. Honey, like I said, it's too early to go home. Again, 1:00. It was 1:00 two hours ago. Hmm? What do you know? My watch stopped. Waiter. Waiter. Beer, we'd like more beer. Ja wohl. Hmm. Cooky, I am not thirsty. I am tired. I want to go home. Man, this is really baby-sitting. Shh... Asleep, huh? He won't be any more trouble. You mean I should take him home now? Well, while he's asleep, it would be better. Yeah. Well, might as well get going, long as he's asleep. I think so. I'll get his basket. (whispering): Wake up, Tiger. Wake up. Hey, wake up, Tiger. (murmuring) Hey, wake up, Tiger. Wake up. Atta boy, atta boy. (crying) (basket thuds) (whispering): I knew you wouldn't let me down. Well, that settles it. You better stay now until he is asleep again. Hey, Tiger. (crying) That a boy. (clock chiming) There, Tiger. (clock chiming) There he is. No dice. It's dawn, pal. You're dead. Tulsa. You have the bottle, but you forgot the milk. Uh, will I see you tomorrow? Uh, I mean, today? Yes. But not for the whole afternoon. I have a rehearsal tomorrow. Today. For your Armed Forces show. Yeah, we're on it, too, so I guess I'll see you there, huh? Yes. Well, uh... good-bye. Well... good-bye. I forgot something. He sure is working overtime. I'm glad you came to Germany. I'm going to write a thank-you letter to your draft board. (chuckles): Yeah, that ought to surprise them. They probably never got a thank-you letter before. (engine starts) I get $10. He gets $20. Even Dynamite couldn't have done better. All right, all right. Long as we get our dough, soldier. Don't rub it in. (band playing) Very nice, very nice. I think we've got it. Thank you, Lili. Thank you. See you tonight, boys. Yeah. Yeah. All right, gang, take five. Hi, Maestro. Well, Maestro, how many numbers you want from us? One. Right. One number, one encore. No, one number, no encores. Rehearsal in 15 minutes. Don't go away. Be right back. Did you see the expression on the Maestro's face? Have you got a light? Yeah. Tulsa. Hi. See you later. Hi. Hi. Have you recovered from your baby-sitting? Now don't go running old Tiger down. He did me a big favor. Oh? If it hadn't been for him, I might have never seen you again. I'll let you in on a little secret. I would have given you one day to call me. Maybe even two. Then, on the third day, I would have called you. Hey, Tulsa. Excuse me. Look, boy, the roof's caved in. Captain Hobart's on his way over here. He'll want to talk to you. What about? You're asking me what about? Who won the bet for us? He did stay in your apartment till morning, didn't he? N-No offense, ma'am. There was no bet. We called it off. Then how come everybody got paid? I got to find Cooky. Maybe he'll have an angle. Look, I know what you're thinking, but that's not how it was. Naturally. The whole matter concerned two other people. No, it was us. You tell me about it some other time. I'll tell you about it now. Very well, soldier, tell me. How much did you win? Going up to your apartment last night had nothing to do with any bet. There was no need to borrow a baby to get into my apartment. Really. You underestimate your attraction. Specialist MacLean? Yes. You have an appointment with Captain Hobart. First I gotta see a pal. Follow me. Wait in here. (baby cooing) Tiger? Tiger? (coos) Excuse me, Miss Lili. Captain Hobart would like to talk to you before you leave. Oh, thank you. Two babies could not look so much alike. You are the one. Oh, you are Lili. Why, yes. I'm the baby's mother. Oh. It was good of you to help Tulsa. Men are so helpless. They are more babies than the babies. You mean, he wa your baby-sitter? Ja, er war. Ich kenne inn shon sehr lange. (laughs) Ein susses baby. Und ein gutes baby. Oh, you're telling me. (both laugh) Miss Lili? (whispering): Excuse me. Miss Lili? Yes. I believe the Army owes you an apology. Now, I must tell you that your rendezvous with this young man had a mercenary motive. There was a bet on it. A bet that MacLean here could spend the night with you alone. I'm afraid that wasn't the case, Captain. We were extremely well chaperoned. You see, Tulsa and I were baby-sitting. Oh, that's right, Captain, for Marla and me. Baby-sitting. Why, I certainly can't transfer a man for that. Well, I wish I'd known before that you went in for this kind of work. Mrs. Hobart and I have a date for bridge tomorrow evening. How are you with twins? Uh, twice as helpful, sir. (baby coos) Here you go, Tiger. Back to your papa. I got, uh, work to do. Captain. Captain. Now, Lili, this isn't the time and it's certainly not the place... Well, of course I'll marry you. I love you. We can get hitched? Mm-hmm. Even this afternoon, huh? Mm. If I get the CO's permission. Oh, maybe. And maybe tonight after the show, you'll win the bet.
