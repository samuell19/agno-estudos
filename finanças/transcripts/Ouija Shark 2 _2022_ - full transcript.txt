(soft music) - [Anthony] My name is Anthony, and this is my story. It seems so very long ago, but only a few short months have passed since my life came to an abrupt end. My daughter, Jill discovered a Ouija board while swimming. She should have realized that it was drawn to her metaphysical aura. She made the mistake of the using the spirit board with her new friends. The psychic backlash was catastrophic. Ouija shark had been released into our world. It fed on the physical and spiritual essence of every soul it encountered. Jill had to reach out for my help. It had been a long time since we last spoke, my knowledge of the occult would be useful. I consulted a medium to draw myself into the fray. This ultimately led to my death at the fins of Ouija shark. Somehow I was not immediately dispatched to the afterlife. I remained behind to confront and weaken the raging leviathan. Jill used what she learned from me to defeat Ouija shark, the creature and the board vanished from our plane of existence. My daughter encountered the human pond responsible for summoning the beast. She has since gone missing. As for me, I'm now cursed to walk among the retched and the damned in the very bows of hell itself. (dramatic music) (soft music) - You just had to play the hero, didn't you? Strike that. You always were a hero. Thank you for helping our daughter in her time of need. I think you're the one that needs a hero now. I promise not to let you down. I've made an appointment with the medium you contacted before you died. Hopefully, she can shed some light on the subject. Farewell, Anthony, but not goodbye. We'll be reunited in this world or another. (dreamy music) - [Anthony] Cressida. Cressida. Cressida! (soft music) - Oh, she'll be here any minute. I hope she isn't too angry. What the heck am I gonna say to her? Gee, I'm sorry your husband died in my parlor fighting a ghostly shark. Yeah right. She's gonna kill me. (doorbell ringing) She's here. What would you do, Brutus? You're a lot of help. (doorbell ringing) Mama told me there'd be days like this. (soft music) - Pardon me for letting myself in. I hope I didn't catch you at a bad time. - No, it's okay. I just didn't expect you to be so exactly on time for your appointment. I'm Cressida. - Illyana. Gee, I'm sorry your husband died in my parlor fighting a ghostly shark. - I know you didn't have anything to do with my husband's death. I would've sensed it. - I see. So you also have a connection to the occult, just like your husband. - I'm still learning. I have some latent psychic abilities. - Won't you please sit down. - Thank you. Now then, tell me what happened. - Your husband came here hoping to make contact with a shark. He wanted to distract it. I warned him against it, but there was no reasoning with him. He called on the shark and the shark came for him. - Heroics, I can't say that I'm surprised. Are there any signs remaining of the battle? - No, I looked everywhere. They completely disappeared. I don't understand how that's possible. - Anything's possible. The events you describe leave me with some unanswered questions. - Such as? - Is my husband really dead. He would've prepared himself for an unearthly confrontation. - Wait, he actually knew what was going to happen? Then he might have of-- - Allowed for a way to escape. It's my only hope. - Sure, but how can we go about figuring out what he did? - We? - I'm too mixed up in all of this to back out now, besides I think I owe it to him and myself. - All right. It'll be a relief to share the burden. Just one more question. - Yes? - If Anthony still exists, then where is he? - Let's consult the crystal ball. - Good idea. (dramatic music) - Mystic shield. (gorilla grunting) (dramatic music) Fireball. (dramatic music) (grunting) Ooh. Pulse blast. (soft music) Can you talk? Who sent you? Why did you attack me? You're not going anywhere until I get some answers. - [Gorilla] Or I can speak to you through telepathy. We who are many were sent to attack you by. - By who? Tell me. - [Gorilla] Master, Master Caldura. He wants you eliminated. He wants your head on the end of a sword. He wants. - I think I get what he wants. Does this Caldura also control the Ouija shark? - [Gorilla] Do not speak its name. To name the beast as akin to calling. (dramatic music) - Wait. Wait. (soft music) A second death for that poor manipulated creature or whatever you call it when a tortured soul has been erased from the afterlife. I have a name and I have a direction. It's more than I've had in a long time. I'm coming for you, Caldura. . I'm coming for you and your murderous little pet. (soft music) - This is getting us nowhere. I thought making contact would be easier than this. - It does seem like there's more psychic interference than usual. Could he be blocking us? - That's a good point. If he's in danger, it's likely he wouldn't want to involve of anyone else. - Maybe we don't have to contact him. There are other ways to discover his location. - Please explain. - Let me think. I have an idea. Ta-da. - What is it? - It's a seeing stone. We can use it with the crystal ball to see Anthony in his surroundings. - Clever girl. Let's try it. - Place this in your left hand. Now, gimme your other hand. - What am I supposed to do? - Fill your mind with thoughts of Anthony. Concentrate. (soft music) - Something's happening. I can feel it. - Look into the crystal ball. - There's Anthony. It looks like he's in, in-- - He's in hell, the fifth circle of hell to be precise. - He's involved in some kind of conflict, battle. - Sadly, that makes sense. - How so? - The fifth circle is reserved for vindictive spirits. Their anger pushes them into eternal combat. - He's gone after the shark. He's still hunting it. - I think you're right. - Well, we can't leave him there. We have to save him. - It's not gonna be easy. I don't know anyone who's ever escaped from hell. - You seem to be a resilient and talented young woman. Don't you have any ideas? - I think breaking outta Hades is beyond my particular set of skills. What you need is a powerful necromancer, someone trained in raising the dead. - Sounds good. Where can I find one of those? - There are only a few left in the entire world. I personally only know one. - Then there's still a chance to bring back Anthony. Who is this person? - Well. - This is no time for cold feet. Who is it? - It's. It's my mama. - Let's pay her visit. - I'm not so sure that's a good idea. - Illyana. - We're not on the best of terms these days. - Family trouble? - The worst. - I understand. Really. Just tell me where I can find her and I'll go see her on my own. - It could turn out to be a fatal mistake, besides I said I would help you. - You have helped me more than anyone. Look, once I've spoken to her, I'll come back here to plan our next move. - I don't feel good about this. It seems to be no other way. Mama lives deep in the forest, behind his house. It's an enchanted forest. It helps with her work. - All right, I'll go now. Anything else I should know? - She doesn't like visitors and she's pretty mean spirited. - I can handle it. I'll also put in a good word for you while I'm there. - I don't think dropping my name will help you very much. - We'll see. - Good luck, Cressida. You're gonna need it. (hopeful music) I bet she's a great mom. (Brutus meowing) (glass breaking) Brutus! Bad cat. Get back here with that seeing stone! (dark music) - It's no use. Hell is just no fun. I'm gonna kill Britney when I see her again. (dark music) Ah! - OMG, that thing ate Betty. Ugh, the bitch deserved it. (dark music) No. Don't. No! (whistling) - That's more than enough out of you. Let's not forget who the real master is around here. Look at me, a shadow of my former evil self resorting to feeding bikini girls to my spirit animal just to keep it under control. (shark snarling) (dark music) - Oh, yuck. I hate it when it does that. - Shut up Betty. - For years without end, I have possessed and impersonated the rich and the powerful. No one was beyond my influence. Kings, presidents, stockbrokers, all bent to my will. I used different spirit animals in several places around the world to achieve my goals. In Russia, it was a brown bear. In India, I summoned a tiger. In Australia, it was ewe, weird place. Then I dreamed up what should have been my master stroke, a shark, a great white shark. It should have been the perfect killing machine. That's when the unthinkable happened, my plans were ruined by one man. His interference led to my banishment and the defeat of my spirit animal. - He looks like a beatnik. - Anthony Struggle, how I loathe his name. I take some solace in the knowledge he died in the process. He's here now, tracking us, a decision he will soon regret. (laughs) - Cuddly gads, daddy-o. You're nothing but a wet rag. (tense music) (screaming) (chuckling) - Let that serve as a lesson to you all. - I've been putting up with crap like this since I died in 1956. - I see you bikini girls are despondent and bored. Well, I know how to liven things up around here.

(evil laughter) (dark music) (gentle music) - Beautiful. Simply gorgeous. (gentle music) Are you all trying to tell me something? I sure could use a little help here. (fire roaring) That's got to be it. (gentle music) (dark music) - So, you must be death. The silent treatment? Really? Why don't you just tell me why you're here. Okay. Maybe I'm communicating in the wrong way. Let's try this. Pick a card, any card, Right. I got that part. You're death. Let's try again. Huh? Third time's a charm, I guess. Interesting, but not very helpful. Maybe we better try something else. Should conduct some kind of seance? Meditation? How about electronic voice phenomenon? Please, anything but a Ouija board? - The near death experience will suffice in this case. - I couldn't get any nearer than this. Shouldn't we have met some time ago considering the circumstances? - That's just it, Anthony. You've got it all wrong. You see, you're not dead. - Not dead? You could have fooled me. I'm discorporate. And this happens to be hell. - True, though you did take some precautions. - Great fices. Before my brief encounter with the shark, I invoked the voluminous voice of Orpheus. - That's right. Orpheus used his spell binding voice to convince Hades to release his wife from the underworld. - Of course. It's all up to my wife, Cressida. She should be able to bring me back. I just need to let her know somehow. - I'm afraid you also blocked all human contact before rushing it into battle. - Yeah, I sure did. So unless she figures that out on her own, I guess I'm stuck here. - That appears to be the case. - What if I challenge you to a game? Maybe then. - Contrary to popular belief, I don't do that sort of thing. You'll just have to trust in the power of love. - Thanks. Thanks a lot. Wait, if I can't do any thing, why did you bother showing up here? Aren't you kind of busy these days? - Oh, I'm always busy. Business is booming. I just wanted you to know that I don't endorse the actions of this spirit shark or those of its master. - You don't? But I thought. - The creature technically serves my ends, but I don't agree with its methods, too many loopholes. - I see. In a way I'd be helping you by getting rid of those two monsters. - In a way. - Too bad I've gotta go about it all alone. - Oh Anthony, that's your fatal flaw. You think you have to do everything yourself. You're not alone. You're never alone. (dark music) (gentle music) - This can't be it. Looks like an old tree fort, something a kid would play in. (gentle music) Nobody's home. (suspenseful music) Hard to believe, but looks like this is the place. Why would someone want to live like this? - That's none of your business. - You must be, that is Illyana's mother. - The name's Terra. Who are you, one of those big city, social workers? Illyana's old enough to live on her own. - My name's Cressida. I came to ask for your help. - Not interested. Shove off. - Wait, you don't understand. This is actually a matter of life and death. - It usually is. Who sent you here? Was it my daughter? - Yes, she-- - She should have known better. Just leave me alone. (soft music) - Hey, I'm not gonna let you go. - Keep your distance. Don't you come near me. - I won't. I'm sorry. Honestly. It's just that I'm, I'm so desperate. - Come on, but don't follow too close. (mystic music) Okay. So why are you here? You better make it good. - My husband is in hell. - So? What makes him any different for most husbands? - No, I mean literally in hell. He used his mystic powers to follow a murderous ghost shark back to its lair. - Well, I gotta admit that's a good one. Go on. - We believe he may have cast a spell to protect himself. - Who's we? - Me and your daughter, Illyana. - When is she going to learn? She just can't leave well enough alone. - She misses you. I can tell. - Don't blow your chance. Stick to the story. - Right. We, I think that Anthony conducted some sort of ritual that allowed him to return from that other dimension. - I see. You actually want me to raise the dead? - No, nothing like that. We just need to learn what he did that may allow for his return. - There's that we, again. - Please. - Follow me. Sit down over there. (soft music) Now, focus your mind's eye on the task at hand. That's it. Use your third eye chakra and look beyond the physical realm. - I can't do it, I just can't. I don't understand. I've been told I have psychic abilities, but I just can't use them. - You're resisting. If you're afraid. - I don't wanna hear it. - Well, you better hear it. The more you open up the easier this will be. - I'll try again. - This time, I'll help you. (mystical music) - We did it. I know what to do now. The answer was inside me all along. - As I knew it would be. Go. There's nothing more I can do for you. - Come with me. Forgive me for meddling, but your daughter needs you. Stop living in her childhood tree fort and reconcile your differences. She still loves you. I'm just trying to help you as you've helped me. - I appreciate your concern really. Perhaps I'll see her again someday. (soft music) - Wait. Thank you. I've gotta get back to Illyana. (dark music) - This is it. And there's the shark. That must be Master Caldura. I have to get closer without being spotted. (dark music) (sighs) - What's going on? Who's out there? (suspenseful music) - No. - Not again. Oh. - Anthony, is that you? You're late. We've been expecting you for some time. (suspenseful music) - I'm here for the shark. Release your wicked influence over that poor deluded creature. - You are mistaken. This shark is pure evil, with or without my manipulations. However, if you really want the shark, by all means, come and get him. - That's exactly what I'm going to do. - Mirror of narcissists. (suspenseful music) - Hey, watch where you█re firing those things. (suspenseful music) You're not the only one who can use magic around here. (suspenseful music) He's on the run. Finish him. (tense music) Fool. You never stood a chance against us. You are about to learn a very painful lesson. (dark music) - Illyana, I'm back. You home? - You're back. Oh, thank goodness. I was so worried. Sorry. I really shouldn't be that forward. A hugger, I guess. - It's okay. We're friends. - Friends can hug, right? - Friends can hug. - Oh, you met my mother, didn't you? I'm so glad she didn't eat you up. Oh, you know what I mean. What happened? - Well, she certainly was a little abrasive at first. - Oh, I knew it. Did you, did you mention me? What did, what did she say about me? - I did. She, I have to be honest here. She doesn't think you should get involved. - Oh. - I can't blame her for that. What we're doing is going to get very dangerous. - Do you agree with her? Should I stay out of it? - I think you're a competent young woman who can make her own decisions. - Thanks. I wish my mom would say things like that. - She did say that she'd like to see you again one day. - Really? Well, at least that's something. - I think so too. She helped me, Illyana. - Do you know how to bring back Anthony? - I do. - Yes! He's gonna be so happy to see you. - Illyana, there's something I should tell you. I walked out on Anthony a few years ago. I also abandoned our daughter, Jill. - Well, I'm sure you had your reasons. - I did, but none of them seem important now. Maybe what we're doing will make up for all that. - Yeah. What are we waiting for? Let's save him. - I'll need you to establish a visual connection, just like last time. - Got it. - Once we can see him, I should be able to construct a psychic link. Unless. - Unless what? I don't like this, you sound worried. - It's Anthony I'm worried about. If he resists us, we won't be able to do a thing for him. - Why would he resist? Everyone needs help sometimes. - You don't know the man like me. He's self reliant to a fault. - Then we'll just have to do our best. - Let's get started. - I almost forgot. We need the seeing stone. (dark music) - Once we've destroyed you, your world will be defenseless. (shark growls) We shall make a smoking ruin out of it just for kicks. (tense music) (screaming) - Oh hell no. (screaming) (tense music) - And now pitiful magician, this shark's gonna kill you. (screaming) - Cressida, hear me. (screaming) - There's nothing anyone can do for you now. (evil laughter) (screaming) - Nothing so far. I just don't understand it. Cressida, what's wrong? - It, it's Anthony. He's in some kind of trouble. - Look, there's something coming through. - There he is. - And there's the shark. - I have to concentrate. Help me to focus. - Cressida! Hear me. Hear me. Oh. - No! - Anthony. Anthony. - Oh my gosh. We did it. Is he gonna be okay? - He's breathing, so that's a start. Lift him up. - Caldura, no. The shark, they're coming. - He's delirious. Let's get him to the couch. (soft music) (dark music) (evil laughter) (screaming) (phone vibrating) - [Jill] Daddy. - Jill? Is that you? - I'm right here, Dad. - Jill! - What's wrong, dear? Are you okay? - Why did you do it, dad? Why did you make mom go away? - I didn't, at least I didn't mean to. - It doesn't matter. She's still gone. - I'm sorry, Jill. - It's all this magic stuff. When are you gonna grow up? - Now, Jill, I know it's hard to believe, but my research suggests that the Astral plane has become unbalanced. - You're unbalanced. Just listen to yourself. This is why mom left us. - But. - Have you ever wondered why I don't bring any of my friends around here? They think you're crazy. The last thing I need is for them to see you acting like this. I'd never hear the end of it. It won't be long before I leave for college. What will you do then? - I'll manage. - I doubt it. You said you'd take care of me. You can't even take care of yourself. - If only I could make you understand. - Daddy? Daddy, what's happening to me? You'd promised you'd always keep me safe. You promised. - Jill. - Daddy. - Jill! (dark music) (screaming) (dramatic music) No, no! What's going on? - You're awake. Thank goodness. - Cressida? Where am I? - You're back at my place. It's like you never left. - Illyana? Then it's true. I'm back. - Just take it easy. You've been through a lot. - There's no time for that. Oh. - You've literally been through hell. You need some time to recuperate. - But? - You're still just as stubborn as ever. - Can I get you something? A drink of water, something to eat? - Please. Just tell me how you got me back. - We used the seeing stone. - And the crystal ball. - To pinpoint your location. - Then I created a psychic link, which allowed us to-- - Hold on, hold on. I get it. We're in all kinds of trouble. - That's all behind you now, like a bad dream. You're safe. - I don't think so. Wait, Cressida. It's really you. (soft music) I knew you could do it. - Well, you know, I did have some help. - I wanna get up. Thank you so much for. - [Cressida] She's a hugger. - I never would've guessed. Ooh. I think I better sit down again. Hey, how did I get in my pajamas? - I brought them. I didn't know what state you'd be in once we rescued you. - I wasn't, you know? - Oh, heavens no. We just needed to get you out of those other clothes. They smelled like, well, you know. - Hell. Yeah. Look, I don't mean to sound ungrateful, but we really do have a problem. - What is it? - Dragging me from hell probably left a door open someplace. If Caldura finds it, figures out how to use it. - Who's Caldura? - The powerful demon behind Ouija shark. We have to prepare for his inevitable arrival. - I'm sorry, I had no idea. - It's not your fault. You did what you thought was best. I have missed you so much. (soft music) - Nothing can stop us now that we're together again. - So what are we gonna do? - We? - It's we now. - Okay. It's we now. - Yes. - We need to go to my place, I mean our home. I can teach you both some spells along the way. - Perfect. - Everything we need is there. (rumbling) - Oh no, don't tell me. - I'll need my work clothes. (dramatic music) Hell's are popping. (dramatic music) We better get moving. (dramatic music) (police sirens) (rumbling) (shark growls (sirens blaring) - Ha, take that Sharky boy. (growling) (dramatic music) (shark growls) (grunting) (shark growls) He's gone. (screaming) (burp) (dramatic music) - Would you look at that? - I can't believe it. - This is the last straw. We're moving to the country where this stuff never happens. - But? - Let's go. - Goodbye city life. (dramatic music) - Hey, what's your problem? (dramatic music) (man screams) (shark growls) (shark growls) (sirens blaring) (shark growls) (explosion) - That looked like my ex's car. - Nice world you have here. I think I'll make it mine. (dramatic music) I'll need to evict the previous tenants, but first an upgrade. (dramatic music) (shark growls) (police sirens) (shark growls) (shark growls) (explosion) - Whoa, that must have been so bad sushi. (sirens blaring) (shark growls) (explosion) (screaming) (dramatic music) - You ain't seen nothing yet, folks. Watch this. Grow my monster. Grow. (dramatic music) - This is Tom Harris with a nightly news 12 special report. The ghostly shark seen shooting balls of fire around the city earlier this evening has now grown to massive proportions. - Hey, what are you doing standing around? Can't you see a huge shark is wrecking the city? - I'm doing a news report about it. - Oh, hi mom. Later, dude. (dramatic music) (evil laughter) - Yes. (dramatic music) (soft music) - It's no use. - Don't lose hope, Anthony. It's not like you. Have a cookie. - You made cookies at a time like this. - You're doing research and Illyana's monitoring the news. I had to do something to keep busy. - Thanks. Wait. - Everything all right? - I've tried everything from automatic writing to Zodiac signs. I just can't find a way to effectively challenge Caldura or his shark. - Maybe you missed something. - Most likely. At this point, I'd give a serious shot to a magic 8-ball. - Oh, I've always wanted one of one of those. - We should consult the book of changes one more time. - I guess it's worth a try. - Hey, check it out. Caldura and the shark are on the news. - Turn it up. - [Announcer] Spookshow Theater, tonight on channel 12. - [Reporter] The shark continues its rampage through downtown and no one is quite sure what this mysterious individual has to do with it. Back to you in the studio. - He's using a Ouija board to control the shark. - He can't exert his influence in this world without it. - If only we could get it away from him. - We'd have to get through that shark first. - He certainly chose an imposing familiar. - Yes. Wait, that's it. Cressida, you've done it again. - What is it, Anthony? - The answer lies in the yin and the yang. - Nice balls. Sorry. - Every force must have its opposite or contrary form. It just stands to reason. Caldura has his familiar. I have to find mine. - That makes sense. - How will you choose it? - I'll use the taro cards. They're my strongest connection to the mystic realm. (exciting music) The four of swords. Of course. The answer is obvious. - It is? - You'd better explain. - The animal associated with this card is an alligator. I happened to see one while I was in hell. It's no coincidence. - Okay, so how are we going to go about connecting with this creature? - We don't do anything. I have to do this on my own. - Not this again. When are you going to trust anyone other than yourself? - I trust you and Illyana with my life. This isn't about that. I simply need to meditate. (mystical music) You do believe me don't you? - More than ever before. - This was a lot easier for my hip replacement. - Hip replacement? - Don't ask. - How long do you think this will take? (mystical music) (growling) (soft music) - Let's take a look. (exciting music) - Oh wow. - It's nice to finally meet you face to face. You already know what to do. We're all counting on you, Tarot Gator. (hopeful music) (tense music) (growling) - Whoa. I think my ex's building. (radio chatter) - [Man] We█ll be in range in five seconds. Stay clear of the platform, releasing now. (radio chatter) Release successful. All clear. ALO delivered, heading back to base. Look out! - [Man] Please put your raft down. - [Man] We only get one shot at this thing. (mumbles) Fire. (dramatic music) (shark growls) (shark growls) (zapping) (explosion) Incoming! Fall back. - Retreat. - All aggression will meet with similar results. Submit now. What was that? (tense music) (sirens wailing) (low drone) (pulsating) (low growl) (shark growl) (low growl) (shark growl) (explosion) (whooshing) (explosion) (pulsating) (explosion) (low growl) (shark growl) Oh, hey, stop that. (tense music) - Hey, that was my ex. (laughs) (tense music) - Now you're gonna get it. (tense music) - A gigantic alligator is now squaring off against the shark. Where these monsters came from is anyone's guess. - Hey, you still here? Don't you know enough to get off the streets. Hey ma, I got your take out. I'll be home soon. (tense music) - Great Scott! (dramatic music) - Okay. I think we better spread out. Did we leave the TV on? - [Announcer] We now return you to Spookshow Theater already in progress. - So here's how Bernie's gonna win in in 2016. - Oh, it's a, it's a Ouija shark! - [Bernie Supporter] Oh, I'm getting outta here. (dramatic music) - How can we do anything against that? - We'll need to focus on Caldura. If we can take him down. - Maybe Ouija shark will go down with him. - Right. Let's go. (dramatic music) - Anthony, should have known you were behind this new beast. Not very original. - Can't let 'em distract me. I've gotta focus my powers. - Nice try, but it's going to be even harder this time, Anthony. I'm at my peak strength. I see you brought along some friends this time. That was a bad decision. Don't you realize you put them in peril? - Smashing shield. - I hope we don't regret this. - Don't be too hard on her. She did manage to protect herself after all. (dramatic music) - Let's finish this. (dramatic music) - You all just a little too green to have any real chance against me. (dramatic music) - [Man] Primary target currently distracted. Retreat orders canceled. Attack while the enemy is occupied. - [Man] Roger tango. I█m on it! - [Pilot] Oops. (dramatic music) Fall back. (dramatic music) - Wow. I knew it. I knew this would happened. I told you all. I knew it. - Hey pal, watch it. - This is my corner your standing on. - Your corner? - Yeah. (dramatic music) - Time to drop the curtain. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! (dramatic music) The weakest link has fallen. Soon, you will all-- What? - Nobody does that to my daughter and gets away with it. (dramatic music) - Mama, you came here for me? (tense music) I think we've all had just about enough of you. (hopeful music) - No. You can't. (hopeful music) (growling) (growling) (man screaming) (explosion) (distant screaming) (growling) - Yeah, we did it! Wait mom? Where'd she go? Did anyone see where she went? - Come with me, sweetheart. It's been an eventful day. (sirens blaring) - Later Gator, and thanks for everything. (gentle music) - Illyana, Anthony, everything is ready to go. - She'll be here in a moment. - What's keeping her? - She's a little anxious. - I'm so excited. It's gonna be great. - It's just a modest ceremony, welcoming you into our circle. - So that kind of makes us like family, right? - We are a family. Let me be the first to welcome you to it. - My turn. - I only wish that mama were here. - She'll be back. She came when you needed her the most. - I hope so. - We have some gifts for you. - Oh boy. First we present you with the cup of life. It bears your emotions and creativity. Be careful not to let it spill (mystical music) - Wine. (mystical music) - This is a magic wand. Through it, you can focus your passion and your purpose. It can bend, but it should never break. (mystical music) - I love it. (mystical music) - Next is a coin marked with a pentagon. This represents your physical needs. - May the pureness of your heart always be abundant enough to share with others. - Thank you. - And finally, the sword. It stands for confrontation, but also for courage. Conflict is inevitable, but how you handle it is what's most important. (mystical music) - I promise to use these gifts wisely. - That's good. We're going to need that wisdom to find our daughter, Jill. - I won't let you down. This sword has me thinking, is Caldura really gone for good? And that shark? - The answer lies in vigilance. From this moment forward, we must vow to always stand against any mystic menace that threatens our world. Apart, we'll always be vulnerable, but together, we're Tarot Force!
