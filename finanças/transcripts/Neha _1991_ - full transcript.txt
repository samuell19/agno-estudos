The Slovak Film Institute presents Starring: In Martin Sulik's film TENDERNESS Script editor: Screenplay by: What happened here? You beat up your father. What's wrong with you? Stop it, please! It's good. Enough! You don't like it? Go sit somewhere else then. Maria. Simon. Sorry. Don't do this to me ever again. Please, stop tormenting us. I think it was enough for one night. - Do you like opera? - I don't understand it. Neither does she. She kept pestering me during the whole performance. We had to leave after the intermission. I don't like to pretend something I'm not. All stories are the same, trivial. It's the same thing over and over. I like things clear and simple. Fortunately, the complicated relationship between a man and a woman can't be turned into music. And that's a good thing. A song needs harmony. When I'm listening to the things you say I don't even want to live anymore. Wait! Wait! I can't keep up! - Let go of me! - No! Come on! Viktor! Come on! Where are you? We'd known each other only a couple of weeks. It's been four years now, right? We were thinking about getting married back then. Not anymore. Watch. Now you'll see something. Turn it off! I'm telling you, turn it off! Let go! - Why are you doing this? - There's nothing to be embarrassed about. Let him see how much we loved each other. Just turn it off! Let go! Turn it off! - Leave it alone! - You're such a jerk, Viktor! - Turn it off! - Now you'll get a better view. Let me go! You should be ashamed of yourself! Aren't you, even a little bit? Say you're sorry. I made up your bed. - I better go. - It's up to you... Is one blanket enough? Don't be mad... March s/ts on the fence, may spr/ng come hence. T/ny ra/ndrops fa/, to the joy of a/. Do you go to college? We got something for you. - What do those books say about death? - Why? What're doing? Stop it! Let go! We could've got killed. I'm immortal. We used to go sledging here in winter. I was the smallest of all the kids. One time, the boys played a game with me... Two of them held me down, and the others were feeding me snow. I cried, they laughed. They left me here all alone, idiots. I crawled all the way here. Interesting. We've always had very little snow. I felt some strange, pleasant warmth. I heard a voice calling in the distance. But I didn't understand a word. In the evening, my father found me. Ever since then, I don't like it when people laugh at me. Shall we go for a swim? Maria can't swim, she's terrified of water. I was tossed in the river and that was the end of all fear! It's really cold! Do you like her? You really like her? Aren't you cold? Stop fooling around. See, she tried. What did you do that for? Maria, wait! - Forgive me! - Let go! I'm sorry. Wash his clothes for him, will you? - What do you keep the boy around for? - You were the one that brought him here. We can't even talk anymore when it's just the two of us. Throw him out and we'll talk. I feel sorry for you. You have to pull yourself together. Don't listen to her. Whatever I do, she's never satisfied. We were visiting a friend of ours. Maria loved it there so much. And the child? It's my friend's son. Maria can't have children. We've tried everything. Nothing works. I've gotten used to her. - Give me my keys and get out! - You can't do this to me! - I've had it. Pack your things and get out! - Where am I supposed to go? I don't care! Fuck! Don't touch me! You hear me?! Open the door! Open it! Everything will be all right, you'll see. You're disgusting. - Where's Viktor? - I don't know. He left early in the morning. What does he do? Nothing. He was fired. He's got two left hands. - How old are you? - Twenty. You have a girlfriend? Good. Will you help me? Why did you throw him out of the house? You don't need to know everything. Hungry. I am not hungry. I am not hungry. - What happened? - I don't like you at all. You live like an idiot. What do you want from me? I've been watching you for quite some time now. What are you scared for? Have you been hurt? Go away. You don't love people, that's not good. If you want to go on living like this, you'll jump out of the window soon. Leave. You should relax once in a while, my friend. Do you like kids? - Is mommy home? - Yes. - Where have you been? - I was busy. She doesn't realize we're here at all. Eyes, mouth, nose... She's deaf. Marta! I don't visit very often. Maybe three-four times a month. She has no family. She used to live with a guy, but he dumped her. He doesn't pay alimony either. It's strange. If you knew what she's been through... But I've never seen her cry once. When I grow up, I'll marry Viktor. He promised me. I hinted to her that you'd like to stay overnight. We'll have a nice time here. She likes you. - Does Maria know about her? - What does Maria have to do with it? Oh, you fell in love. Run after her, if you miss her so much. You think I'm doing this for myself? For Marta, it's a miracle when I'm here. She needs me more than anyone else. But I won't keep you here. Go, find Maria. Have a conversation. I don't get you. We both could've spent the night. What's going on? Viktor gave me the key. What for? Why are you staying with him? And who should I live with? He was the only person to help me at least a little bit, that I was happy with. Should I leave him now? He keeps humiliating you. Perhaps he has a reason. Maria, open the door! I know you two are in there! Do you know why he gave me the key? I do. But why did you take it? You wanted to screw me, didn't you? Come on then. Never mind. You need protection. Too bad. I thought you'd teach me something. Why did you do it? She's all I have. Only she keeps me going. You're lying. Who do you think you are? Wait! I can't sleep. I wake up in the middle of the night, then I walk around the apartment, anxiety haunts me. Sometimes I lie down on the floor and recite a nursery rhyme. Then I sit at the desk and translate those funny little verses. In the morning, I'm empty. All I feel is indifference towards others. I'm not able to do what I really want. How is it possible? Good morning. One night, a vagabond turned up here. He had to spend the night here. He woke up at dawn and he saw an angel standing in front of him. He ran to the parish priest and told him: I've had a revelation. But the priest didn't believe him. He made fun of him. The vagabond left and the priest became restless. Something kept drawing him here. At noon, he set out for this hill. It was the middle of the summer, the priest stood on top of the hill and waited. Suddenly, snow started falling. It covered the whole country, only this place remained green. A circle. The priest saw that a miracle happened. The local people built this church here. They say the priest had himself buried in the wall. I have to go. Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed. What now, when miracles don't happen anymore? I see but I don't believe. The brain, the central organ of our mental abilities, languishes and withers away due to the constant draining of the sap of life, that we lose in the arms of women. According to Galien, the brain of a lusty man is no bigger than a child's fist. It's been proven that during the creation of the world, God created small animals that became the seeds of future generations. Why couldn't a child grow from this seed in the mother's womb without having to pass through the body of a man first? Why couldn't a woman become pregnant without a man's assistance? What are you reading all this for? Why? Where're you going? Home. Did you know that Viktor is cheating on you? I did. Good job! She dumped me! I'm sorry but I can't help you with that. - You've turned her against me! - That's not true. She's yours! Go, run after her! You were rolling around here all day. How was she? You're immoral. You do as you please. But why? I haven't been thinking about it. Maybe I want to experiment. Sometimes I wonder how far I can go. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. The feeling is what matters to me. I don't want to talk about it. So you're quite satisfied with yourself? It's not about that. I don't need to feel content. Now you try. We need to relax a little. What did you tell her? I don't know. She taught me that. She did the same thing for me the first time I came here. It means that she likes you. She lives in a world of her own. She only knows what she can see. She's like a child. She's missing one dimension. And that's a good thing. She's not as complicated as Maria. I understand her. Do you want her? Stroke her. She is so... humble. Try her. Don't worry. Why don't you want her? Make love to her. Then she won't feel like you despise her. Do your best. You're tired. It's time to sleep. I can't stop thinking about Maria. She touched me in such a strange way. She leaned towards me but she didn't kiss me. She bit me in the shoulder. Then she walked around the room a read some translation to me. What was it? I don't remember exactly. A wiseacre came to a sage, meaning to prove that he was smarter than the sage. He held a little bird in his hand and asked: "If you are really so wise, tell me, is the bird dead or alive?" And he thought: If the sage says it lives, I'll squeeze my fist and kill the bird. If he says the bird is dead, I'll open my hand and the bird will fly away. The sage smiled and replied: "It's up to you whether the bird shall live or die. " Do you get it? I can't make her out. She kicked me out and I've no idea why. - You came for your things? - No. - I came to talk to you. - What for? I can't live alone. If you let me go now, I won't get over it so soon. I have nowhere to go back to. But I don't need you. Why? Now, when we've grown used to each other? When we know everything about each other? Now you want to end things with us? You could never stand being with anyone else. I love you. - Don't laugh. - I can't help it, you're so ridiculous. What do you want to do? Let me show you something. This is where I met Maria for the very first time. Pretty, isn't she? I recorded this. Look at her, our Maria. What do you say? So, are you happy now? How much longer do you want to sit here like this? You won't even talk to me anymore? You're not hungry, or what? I don't want to eat. I stink even to myself. What are you doing here? We moved out of the flat. We changed it for two smaller ones. - How did you find me? - We remembered. Better? - You noticed? - What? It's strange, what happened. Maria is pregnant. The ground is so warm. It's a shame I don't have a camera. It would be a nice film. Cast and crew: Editor: Sound: Music: Executive producer: Director of photography: Directed by: Made by:
