A new, clean tablecloth! It's gotta be a new, clean tablecloth. It's got to be clean, clean, clean. It's got to be new, new, new. Clean and new! All right, Miller? Clean enough. Shiny enough for you. You satisfied? Mm, why do I love you, Miller? Why do I love you? (scoffs) Because, well, because I love you! With your clean, clean glasses. With your clean, clean silver. With your fancy-schmancy toothpicks. With your extra, extra napkins. With your hot, hot coffee! With your cold, cold ice water! With your driving me crazy all the time! If you'll drop dead yesterday, Miller, it wouldn't be a minute too soon. (clearing throat) (door slams) (meaningless vocalization) (sharp rap) (sighs) (coughs) (chair slams) (grumbles) (coughing) (plate crashes) - Gittelman, Gittelman. Well, you did notice me finally, did you? I'm here, Gittelman, I'm here! It was an accident, Gittelman. I'm telling you it was an accident. I swear, as your old friend, as your old enemy, an accident. Gittelman, don't you even say, "Hello"? Hm, you old rascal, you. Hey, that, there, there, there! Gittelman, there! Let's do a good job! And there. Tell the truth, Gittelman, if not for me, what would this place be, eh? A dirty dump of a sloppy, old restaurant! Am I right? - Whatever you say, Miller. My me is whatever you say. - Because I got you trained, haven't I? Go on, go on, get rid of that. (slams glass) (grunts) (grunts appreciatively) (ringing glass) Gittelman! - [Gittelman] Coming! (rings glass) - Do you know what day this is? Don't you even know what day this is? - Thursday? - No, not Thursday you fool. What special day? Think! Gittelman, this is the fifth anniversary. Today! Five years ago today, I came into this miserable dump of a restaurant for the first time. Now, what do you think of that, huh? - To tell you the truth, I thought it was longer. - Five years I've been giving you my business. Come here every day to eat this abominable food. And to be served by the most incompetent waiter ever put on this earth. Five days a week for five years! And you're not satisfied? - I'm satisfied, I'm satisfied! Did you hear me complain, Miller? - You would dare to complain about a customer like me? Gittelman, how much tip do I leave you every time? Five days a week, every single time, how much tip do I leave you, huh? - 30 cents. - And in a week? - A dollar and a half. - And in a year? - 52 and 26. 78 dollars. - And that's just for one year, isn't it? Now we got five years to multiply that by. Go on, go on! - 35 and three is 39. 390 dollars. - 390 dollars that I, personally, have given you. Just for handing me this slop! Just for this miserable service! - Miller, for the 390 dollars, thank you. But for that, I give you the best. And you know that's the truth, Miller. - Because I trained you! I taught you how to be a real waiter! I've devoted myself to you, Gittelman. - Well, you also getting something. Personal service, a private restaurant! We don't open for dinner till 6 o'clock, but you insist on coming here every day at 5. - Of course. You expect me to eat with the riff-raff that comes in here? Selig's Restaurant, a rendezvous of the lower classes. I have to get here before your miserable customers arrive in order to get anything decent, to be served like a gentleman. Because I trained you! You and that creature in that sloppy kitchen who imagines he's a chef! - Miller, you also get a pretty good meal for $2.75. Don't forget that. - Oh? Let's look into that, Gittelman. Let's, hand me a menu and we'll just look into this! What do you do with this, dip it in the chicken soup? Now, a magnificent dinner for $2.75. Is that what you call it? - Who said magnificent? All I said was it's not a bad meal for the price. - All right, let's look into that, now. Let's just look into it. Complete dinner, $2.75. Now let's see what this means. Appetizer or soup. Or soup. Not and soup. Or soup. That's not very complete right there, is it? - Well, a bar mitzvah banquet it's not. - All right, let's see now the splendid choice that Selig's offers his customers. Fish! Two kinds of fish. Now, that's a choice, isn't it? The sea is swarming with every type of creature. The fish markets are loaded down with the delicacies of the deep. And Selig's gives his customers a choice of two kinds of fish! - And what about the herring? That's not a fish? - No, what's the use? Talk to you, talk to the wall. Gittelman, for $2.75 I can feed myself at home like a king! - So why do you come here every day to suffer? - What do you expect me to do, shop for food? Cook my own dinner? Clean up the dirty dishes? I am retired, Gittelman. I am a retired gentleman. A widower and retired. Retired from active life due to an unfortunate physical condition which has undermined my health. I'm a sick man. - I should be so sick. - Inside, Gittelman. Inside, I'm rotting away. I take 17 pills a day! And you want me to exhaust myself preparing meals when I can be served like a gentleman in restaurant? - So how come you pick this restaurant to be a gentleman? - Because of you! You, Gittelman! What other restaurant in the whole world has a Gittelman to amuse me, to entertain me? I wait every day just to watch you perform. Begin, Gittelman. Begin your act! - So what are you talking about? - The menu. I am waiting to hear your personal, inside, straight from the kitchen recommendations. What shall I have today, Gittelman, eh? I'm listening. - You like roast beef? (inarticulate agreement) So, don't take it. - So don't, so don't take it? (chuckles) That's wonderful. Why? Why shouldn't I take the roast beef? - Because yesterday it was in better condition. (laughs) - Oh, Gittelman, you're priceless! You're a treasure! Yes, tell me, what should I take? - Take the chicken. It was fresh roasted today, with onions. - With onions? That's marvelous. You weren't gonna tell me, were you? I had to dig it out of you! Go on, bring me the chicken. - One chicken, with onions! - Without onions. - Hold the onions! You want the usual appetizer, shrimp cocktail? - You know what I take! And none of that four lousy little shrimps stuff, either. You tell them, four shrimps is no cocktail! - Since when did I ever serve you four shrimps? You always get five! - Because I trained you! Go on, go on. - One shrimp cocktail, supreme! Count 'em. - Well, a cocktail is supposed to be a cocktail. You wouldn't want me to report Selig's to the License Commissioner, would you? One inspector here, and (raspberry) they close the whole place down. Now, be honest with me, Gittelman. You got roaches in that kitchen or not? - No roaches in the kitchen, Miller! No roaches! - Oh, did I offend you? Did I offend you, Gittelman? Is it possible that I offended you? Gittelman, don't you know you are incapable of being offended? You're a waiter! A waiter cannot be offended! A waiter is not a man, a waiter is a creature put on this earth to serve customers. And the customer is always right! Do you know that, Gittelman, the customer is always right? Do you believe that? - I believe it. - Then how could you possibly be offended? (slaps table) (bangs chair) Take this shrimp, Gittelman! Not fit for human consumption! Am I right? - You're right. - These shrimps, Gittelman, are the most ancient specimens of sea life ever preserved on the earth! Am I right? - You're right, you're right. - All right, now bring me that miserable chicken. - God damn it. - Gittelman, are you trying to tell me that at some remote period in history this thing on my plate was a chicken? - It's possible. But how remote, I can't tell you. But if I were you, I would taste it at least. - Gittelman, it's good, it's not bad! It's edible! (laughs) You should have seen your face. You were pale, you were shaking. Tell me, how could a man let this happen to him? How could he become a waiter? - It's a living. That's how it happens. - But you enjoy being a waiter. Gittelman, more ice for my water, right away. You see, you enjoy serving me. You have the soul of a waiter. - I don't know what you want from me, Miller. I'm making a living for my family. - Family? You mean there are actually more Gittelmans on earth? - I have a wife and two girls. Am I allowed? (inarticulate agreement) - Girls? You see, you couldn't even produce sons. Now, I had sons. Two magnificent boys to make me proud. Gittelman, if you're gonna have children, that's what you have. Sons! Sons to support you when your own strength fails. - I'm satisfied with my two girls. They're very nice, smart girls! They gonna go to college! - Girls, to college? And is that what you do this miserable work for? To send two useless girls to college? - Why not? It can't hurt them. - Oh, Gittelman, learn about life! My two sons didn't go to college! And you should see them now. Successful businessmen supporting their father and seeing to his comforts and his needs! Gittelman, how could you lead this awful life to send two girls to college? - Because I believe in education. With an education, everything is possible. - That's the thinking of the poor, that education solves everything. You have the poor man's delusion, Gittelman. - And you, Miller? You also missed out on an education? - Take away this chicken, I can't stand the sight of it. - You also didn't learn a profession, go to college to be a something? - Gittelman, the chicken. And bring me a cup of coffee a man can drink. None of that warmed-up stuff from last night, either, you hear me? - So maybe with an education you would be sitting in a better restaurant. - The coffee, Gittelman, the coffee! And a little glass of wine. This is fresh coffee, you're telling me? - Just made this morning! - From what? - From what. From coffee! From what! Good coffee! - And would you know good coffee? Do you know anything about the good things in life? - Maybe yes, maybe no. And you know, Miller? - Of course I know. I know how to enjoy life. - So tell me, Miller, how do you enjoy life? - Do you expect me to imagine that you would understand? - So try me! - Gittelman, from the moment I get up until I close my eyes, my life is one continuous series of pleasures and joys. Just take the beginning of my day. I sleep in a large, comfortable bedroom. Two windows for cross ventilation. A view of the avenue. A rug on the floor, naturally. And I sleep, I sleep as light as I want to. - You're alone, so you sleep. - Of course I'm alone, I'm a widower! - And it's not lonely? - Gittelman, what do you know? I'm alone. But lonely? When my life is so full? When my whole day is filled with all kinds of things? - So, with what kind of things you fill a day with? - Eh, what's the use? I shouldn't even be talking to you. Look at you with your flat feet, your bent back, and your sad face! You remind me of the spirit of sorrow! The spirit of sorrow and sadness, that's what you are! And you want to know how a day can be filled with happiness? - So tell me, how? - Gittelman, even breakfast. I go down leisurely to the coffee shop. Newspaper under my arm, walking slowly, calmly, observing the world. Nothing on my mind. I sit down at my table. I have a glass of juice, a cup of coffee, good coffee! And then, I'll order a few eggs. Maybe a little bacon and a toasted English. Then, like a gentleman I sit there, enjoy my breakfast, and read my paper. - All by yourself in a coffee shop? - What's the use? You don't understand how other people live. All you know is the kitchen, the tables, the dishes. Selig's Restaurant, that's your world. - And you? - Me? I have a glorious day ahead of me every day of the year! - Glorious? - Because it's mine! I can do with it what I wish. - Like, for example? - Example. Gittelman, have you ever been, in your whole life, to the movies in the afternoon? The theater is quiet. There are plenty of seats. Nobody rushing, pushing you. You can sit anyplace you like. There's a place for your coat. You can stretch out your legs, relax, watch the picture, enjoy it. And if it's a dull picture, you take a little nap. That's an experience, Gittelman! - So how many times a day you can go to the movies? - Gittelman, you have a total lack of imagination. Do you know that we have parks in this city? Beautiful parks, with benches, with trees, lovely walks. Have you ever in your whole life been to the park in the afternoon on a weekday? No crowds! No noise! You could hear the birds! - And you have this, this glorious day all by yourself? - If I want company, I can have all the company I want! I can have a dozen friends to join me if I wanna! But if I wanna be alone, there is nobody in the whole world can tell me otherwise! Oh, Gittelman. I can see you have no understanding of such things. You slave away here all day. You go home a tired man. And the next day it starts again. - Maybe you're right, Miller, maybe you're right. Except, you know something? When I come home, it's not bad. It's nice. Tired, I am. But when I come home, my family is waiting for me. My wife, the girls. One girl plays a little piano, the other sings a little bit. It's nice! - A piano? You mean you go through this misery here all day and they spend your money on a piano? - Why not? I like a little piano. It's nice. - But Gittelman, those girls! Send them out to work! Let 'em get married! Get 'em off your back. Not sit around the house and waste their time playing a piano! - In our house, we like a little music. It's nice. - Gittelman, where could you get the money for a piano? Where could you find the room for a piano? - In the living room! It's not Grand Central Station, but for a piano, we got room. - Gittelman, tell me, what did you have to squeeze out to squeeze in a piano? What did you do, crowd everybody in one bedroom? - Who says crowded? The piano is in the living room. The dining room is in the dining room. The kitchen is in the kitchen. And everybody has their own room! - You have a dining room? - Small. - You have a separate bedroom for each one? - Also small. - Where do you live, Gittelman, in some kind of God-forsaken dump of a slum? - I wish on everybody they should live in such a slum! It's a nice, big development. With grass outside, a place to sit in the fresh air. And you should see how they keep it clean! We even have a tree, small. - Gittelman, you're telling me that you live in a development, with three bedrooms, a dining room, a piano in the living room, and you're gonna send two girls to college? I hate liars! Gittelman, I warn you I hate liars! - Miller, I hate 'em, too! But if you're asking me, I'm telling you. - It's impossible, a man like you, a waiter! - You say it's impossible, Miller, it's impossible. - You did all that just by being a waiter? - Miller, I'm already 20 years a waiter. So in 20 years, it's possible. - Just by saving your money, Gittelman? - Who said I did it by saving money? - Then how, huh? Oh, I know. You won it at the racetrack, that's how, eh? Gittelman, you got a nose for the horses? You get hot tips? - A nose I got, but not for horses. - Then how? How? Of course, I go. The Irish Sweepstakes! (laughs) Gittelman wins $100,000 in the Irish Sweepstakes! Lucky waiter from Selig's Restaurant decides to buy piano and send two girls to college! (laughs) - No, Miller, no Sweepstakes either. - Then how? How? - You want to know? - Yeah! - I'll tell you. - Investments, plain and simple. Here and there I made a little investment. - What investment could you make? - Well, one I made right here. - Where? - Here, Selig's Restaurant. A couple of years ago, Selig needed money, so now I own 30%. - You own 30% of Selig's Restaurant? - So far. I may put in a little more. - You mean, you mean all the time I've been eating here, five years, every time I pay for my check you're getting 30% of the profits? - Why not? As a partner, it's my share. - Oh, oh ho. Oh ho. No wonder! No wonder you let me insult you! All the time you're standing there, you're thinking, "Let him insult me. "I'm making money on him!" - I couldn't say it better myself. - Gittelman, that's a low, cheap, dirty, tricky thing to do! - Miller, did I ask you to insult me? You enjoy it? It makes you feel good? So insult! - You're laughing at me! - To tell you the truth, Miller, some of the things you said, it was nothing to laugh. - You didn't stop me! - Business is business. Me, I'm strictly interested in getting ahead. - I bet you are. Oh, I'll just bet you are! A partner in this restaurant! Oh, you're a sneaky one. And that's probably only part of the story! Tell me, Gittelman, maybe you own the whole building! - Myself? No. With my two partners together, we own it. - And you rent this part to Selig's Restaurant, of which you are also a partner? - One hand washes the other. - Gittelman, you amaze me. You have succeeded in amazing me. To think that you, a low, miserable, to think that a plain, ordinary waiter. Gittelman, how long you been doing this, making investments? - Since practically from my first dollar. In saving, I don't believe. In the savings bank, there should be a few dollars for an emergency. But money was made to be invested. - Made to be invested. - Not just like that! Not every day. Not in every scheme. But in a good proposition, invest. - Gittelman, oh, do you mind if I help myself to another cup of coffee? - Sure, all the coffee you want! - Thank you. Thank you, Gittelman. Thank you very much. - A dirty spot. - That's pretty good coffee, you know? Tastes fresh. - I'm glad you like it, Miller. - Ah, Gittelman? This technique, this approach to investment. It sounds rather fascinating, you know? It interests me. - Of course! Interesting it is! - Gittelman, would you, is there, are you contemplating any investment in the near future? - Well, well, could be. - Oh, you are? Gittelman, my friend, what sort of investment is it? - Well, the details I can't give you. After all, to find such a thing takes a lot of snooping around. You know what I mean? High and low you gotta snoop. One thing after another, you gotta say no to. Then, if you're lucky, something comes along, it's a possibility. - And you've been lucky? I mean, you found--? - What can I say? So far, it looks good. - How, eh, how does it look? - [Gittelman] Very good. - I mean, how good? - It should bring a return, maybe 12, 15%. - That's a maximum? - [Gittelman] Minimum! - And it's safe? - 100% safe, nothing is. But as far as safe is safe, it's safe. - And it's in what? - In what? (laughs) In a proposition! - Of course, I understand. You got to keep it under your hat, eh? - Miller, a good proposition is like a beautiful girl walking down the street naked. Before she can go very far, other people want to get in! - (laughs) Oh, that's very clever, Gittelman! Yes, you're a clever one! Gittelman, you know, as a matter of fact, I would be interested in such a proposition myself. - 12 to 15% is very interesting! - No, no, I mean such a proposition might prove very attractive to me. Oh, Gittelman, could I get you a cup of coffee? - What? - [Miller] Could I get you a cup of coffee? - Oh, that's very nice! Miller, I like it hot. It should burn my tongue. - Gittelman, would I get a man like you a cold cup of coffee? (chuckles) - Just right. - Gittelman, what I'm saying, what I'm suggesting, is that I would like to consider the opportunity of investing in this proposition myself. - Go ahead, consider. Consider from today to tomorrow. - No, Gittelman, what I'm saying is I would like the opportunity to invest in this proposition! - Absolutely not. - Why not, Gittelman? You wouldn't do this for me? - It's, we got three, four partners already lined up! Enough. - Gittelman, it would be very important for me to make this investment. - You're right. 12, 15%, that's important. - No. No, no. I mean, to me, a man in my position. For me it would be very important. - In your position? What's the matter with your position? A glorious day every day you live. You see movies when nobody else sees them. You hear birds when nobody else hears them. You're having one pleasure after another all day long! You could be in a better position? - Gittelman, sit down a minute. You could sit, you're a partner here. Here. That's the way. - Gittelman, let me talk to you as man to man. After all, we're two men, about the same age, hm? You and I, we've lived through a lot, we know about life. Do I have to tell you, Gittelman, that life is not always what you see on the surface? There's the outside, the part the world sees, and there's the inside, the truth. The bitter truth. You understand me, Gittelman? - I got an idea. - Gittelman, I'm going to tell you something that will shock you. While it's true, I lead a good life, a very good life, it is also not true. I mean, sometimes, in some ways. In fact, it's a horrible life. - Because you're alone all the time. - No, not because I'm alone, but because I'm helpless. Would you believe that? A man like me, scared and helpless? You see, when I had my heart attack and I had to stop working, I told you I was sick, Gittelman? Well, that's my sickness. When I had to stop working, my two sons assumed the responsibility of providing for me. Which they should, that's what sons are for. Well, I told you they were successful. One works in the office, and the other has a little store. They're struggling, it's not easy for them. But, that's all right. Anyway, the two of them, they got together and they decided how to take care of me. They got me this furnished room. That big bedroom I told you about? That's also my living room, my dining room, my kitchen. They give me so much a month, the two sons together. They decided how much I need, and that's what I get. Sounds good, doesn't it? But, you see, there's a curse to it. A bitter curse. Because no matter what your sons tell you, no matter what you tell yourself, it makes you a beggar! Suppose, Gittelman, suppose I want a new coat? Suppose a new suit sometimes? Suppose I wanna smoke three cigars a day instead of that one I save for dinner? Suppose I really wanted to have breakfast in that coffee shop, like I told you, instead of a roll and coffee in my room? Suppose, even, I wanted to go away someplace to get away from that hot room, the hot city? Gittelman, I have to beg for it. Beg for it! And even that check I get once a month, if it's four days late, five days late, I'm helpless. You know, they once had a fight over who was entitled to deduct me on his income tax! They couldn't settle it for a week! And during that week, while I waited, while I waited for that check, suddenly, Gittelman, I was a scared, old man. Oh, some part of it, Gittelman, some parts of this life you get used to. The being alone, you'll get used to that. When they should invite you for dinner once a week like they used to in the beginning when their mother died, and now they forget, you'll get used to that. Even to the idea, the idea itself, that these kids who used to break your heart if they cried or they hurt themselves, these same kids you watched over, made plans and dreams for, that these same kids can now forget you, ignore you, begrudge you! But the bitter curse you cannot accept, Gittelman, is that you're helpless. So helpless that you have to beg! That! Now do you understand me, Gittelman? Now do you see why this is so important to me? Gittelman, I have the money from my wife's insurance. It's in the bank, I've been afraid to touch a penny of it. My last refuge, you know. My last refuge! But if I could invest it in that safe investment, if I could earn that money you said it would earn, it would make the whole difference! Hey, Gittelman, where you going? - Miller, I'm sorry for you. I really am. Your troubles, I understand. But to get mixed up with you in a business proposition, that's another story. - Gittelman, sit down. Please, sit down. You could do this for me, can't you? Listen to me? - So, I'm listening. - Gittelman, there must be something you can do to help me. You figured it all out, how to lick it. You made investments! Gittelman, you're the smartest man I know. - Suddenly by you I'm smart? For five years, you laughed on me, insulted me, humiliated me, and now I'm smart? - Smart? You're a genius! To do what you have done, to worked it all out. Gittelman, you have the instincts of a Rothschild! - A Rothschild, already! - What am I talkin' about, a Morgan! - Well, I planned a little here and there. - Planned? You set up a financial structure worthy of a Rockefeller! Gittelman, you have the touch. - I was a little bit lucky too. - Luck? Don't tell me luck. It was sound planning, that's what it is! Strategy, foresight! Gittelman, I respect you. I respect you, Gittelman. - Thank you, Miller. - Gittelman, I'll take your advice on anything, just guide me, tell me what to do. - No, Miller. No. - No? No? Gittelman, why? - Because I can't. I can't do nothing for you. - Just this investment, this one investment! - What investment? - What? What, what investment? The investment! - Miller, there's no investment. I'm a nothing, a waiter, a plain waiter here. - No you're not. You're a partner, you have investments! - Miller, I don't have investments, I'm not a partner, I'm a nothing. Like you said before. A nothing, a waiter. - No, you're just telling me that. No, no, you're not just a waiter. You have those things. You have everything! - What things? Me? - Gittelman, I say you're not just a waiter! I know it! You're a smart man! You're not just a waiter! Gittelman, Gittelman, you're not just a waiter. Gittelman, Gittelman, Gittelman. What are you, Gittelman? - Me? I'm what you said. - What? - What? Whatever you say, that's what I am. ♪ So bing bong bing bong ♪ ♪ Bum biddy bum ♪ ♪ Bum bum bum biddy bum ♪ ♪ Biddy biddy bum ♪ ♪ Ah bum bum bum bum ♪ ♪ Bum biddy bum ♪ ♪ Bum bum bum biddy bum ♪ ♪ Biddy biddy bum ♪ ♪ Biddy bum bum bum ♪ ♪ Bum bum biddy bum ♪ ♪ Biddy bum bum bum ♪ ♪ Bum bum biddy bum ♪ ♪ Biddy bum biddy bum biddy bum ♪ ♪ Biddy biddy bum bum bum bum ♪ ♪ Biddy biddy bum bum ♪ ♪ Biddy biddy bum bum bum ♪ ♪ Bum biddy bum ♪ ♪ Bum badda bum biddy bum ♪ ♪ Biddy bum biddy bum bum ♪ ♪ Bah, a dadda deeda dadda dah dah dah ♪ ♪ A dah dah dee dah dum dadda dum ♪ ♪ Dah dah dah dee dah dum ♪ ♪ Deeda dum ♪ ♪ Dah dah dah dah deeda dum dum ♪ ♪ Deeda bum bum bum ♪ ♪ Bum bum bah dah ♪ ♪ Dah dah dah dah ♪
