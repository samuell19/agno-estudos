A strong taste Velvety texture with small seeds Enveloped in yellow flesh Sweetness with a hint of bitterness Are all missing Mei Lian I realised that Ever since your dad passed away The quality of durians from Fengshou Yuan Has also gone to dust We thought the durian from your plantation Would get better with age But contrary to that It's not even comparable to kampung durians So tragic We watched you grow up We grew up with your dad Playing marbles and flying kites With your substandard durian If we do buy it from you It's only on your dad's account Are you able to raise the price a little? The price will not be too high Let's not talk too much How about this At 60% of the market rate We will take it off your hands It's not even enough to buy fertilisers Friendship and money are two separate matters Look There's been no improvement over so many years Look at this durian Who can I sell it to? Right? Uncle Liu I'm coming In the 1980s Someone from Pahang came to Jajahan Gua Musang in Kelantan And happened to try the Musang King durian He felt that the taste profile was unique And so he brought the seedlings Back to his hometown in Raub and propagated it Resulting in the Musang King durian's popularity skyrocketing Mr Wang from Wang Mao Shan Musang King Is a true expert in Musang King Everyone please take a look These durians were not deliberately tied up there Because if we don't do this When the durians ripen and fall to the ground They will crack open and will not last very long Do you all want to try it? Yes! It is said that back in 2010 Macau's gambling tycoon Stanley Ho was in Singapore When he tried Musang King for the first time and loved it He immediately chartered a plane to bring 88 durians Back to Hong Kong for his tycoon friends 10 of which went to Hong Kong's richest man Li Ka-shing The Musang King has finally attained royalty status And became famous all over May I ask what are you doing? I want to bring this home And try planting some durians Let me tell you You can't grow Musang King from seeds alone It is grown through grafting If you just plant the seed You will still get durian But it won't be Musang King Don't ask me why This is the beauty of Mother Nature You can't plant that His durian is not bad We can discuss it with him Boss we would like to discuss something We are fruit distributors in our country This durian of yours is impressive Thank you We would like to bring it to China Can we? Good idea How much do you want? We have discussed We would like 40 to 50... Baskets? We export more than that to Singapore alone Save your breath No We meant 40 to 50 Tons Singapore Let me introduce to you On a Musang King There is a 5-point star at the bottom How much for a kilo? 30 dollars 30 dollars? They are selling it for 10 next door My cost is already 28 dollars Miss can I at least earn 2 dollars? What other varieties are there? Yes Introduce them Sultan King Red Prawn Tekka XO Black Thorn Are all not available today We're only left with Musang King Seriously? Alright we'll get two Please take a seat Two Musang King Got it Wait Get those below Hui Boss Why are you getting those below? Do you want to earn money or be honest? Earn money Target Ah Hui Ah Shui come over This is the best durian in Singapore Take a seat I will order Give me a couple each of XO, Black Gold and Red Prawn They are my business partners I'm sorry we're all out of those We're only left with Musang King Can? Alright give me a few good ones Ah Shui Do you want to invest in durians? Business is very good Look at the number of customers I have told you I am not interested in the durian business Make it quick Let me tell you If you miss this chance that's it That's fine I have already missed it for over 20 years Hurry up they are my big clients Dear durian plantation owners I didn't invite many people today As I only trust you all Please do me a favour And keep this meeting a secret Chinese nationals have begun to realize How good Malaysia's Musang King is And they would like to import Musang King into China The purpose of this meeting Is to hopefully consolidate everyone's production And sell it in bulk To the Chinese market I hope that we do not keep relying on The sales system of "2 Kings and 1 Queen" If they find out They will take offense If we are blacklisted We will not be able to sell our durians to Singapore There's only 5 million people in Singapore It's too small How big is China? They have 1.4 billion people Think about it 1.4 billion people If they eat just 1 piece each that's 1.4 billion pieces If there are 10 pieces in a durian That's 140 million durians Can you imagine how big the market is? Currently the durians exported to China from Malaysia Are frozen fruit What I want to do Is to ship the whole durian directly to China I want the Chinese to be able to Experience the joy of opening the durian themselves Aren't Thai durians already exported to China? That's different They are plucked before they ripen And just like papaya and bananas the flavour is sacrificed For it to last the long voyage Our Musang King is different My plan is the moment the durian is ripe And falls off we will flash freeze it And air freight it to China I call this "T to T" Or "Tree to Table" Times have changed So should the way durian is eaten We need to be able to adapt And use new methods Everyone look We have more and more durian plantations in Malaysia Production is increasing year by year We cannot just focus on the Singaporean market We need to operate on a global level Hi I am Ming Teck I am Swee Mui Are you a durian plantation owner? I am representing my father Nice to meet you Let's go over there Okay Wang Mao Shan Hello Are you the daughter of Mr. Liu from Fengshou Yuan? My name is Liu Mei Lian I noticed you earlier Your proposal earlier Is very good Can we join? Of course Thank you However I need a tree doctor Do you know how to treat trees? When I was young I did not learn how to grow durians from my father After he suddenly passed away I took over Fengshou Yuan But I didn't know how to properly grow them And the quality has been deteriorating Growing durian requires complex knowledge This is a Musang King old tree When my dad was young this was the first tree he planted In the whole plantation this bears the best fruit The rest have been deteriorating in quality over time Price has been steadily dropping too Are your children helping you? Yes all 3 of them are My youngest son Was initially studying Information Technology And wanted to go to Kuala Lumpur to work I told him to transfer to the Agriculture major So that he can help us when he graduates My son is very lucky He was awarded a scholarship from the Durian Association Is there such a scholarship? Yes and it is a handsome amount What about your husband? He is no longer around I'm sorry However for you as a woman It is quite a feat to manage such a huge plantation It must have been tough Don't worry I will help you Really? Give me 2 to 3 years To improve the quality of the durian Thank you Don't mention it When the quality of your durians improves Both of our plantations can be integrated And managed together The production volume will go up And when we want to export it Or distribute to Singapore I guarantee the price will increase exponentially Integrated management? Is that possible? A union with my boss is mutually beneficial Both parties will benefit He's talking about the union of the plantations Of course Let's have a look at the back - Right let's go - Over here Your plantation is huge It's alright What? You asked Wang Mao Shan to be our consultant? Old Wang from next door? Is he so experienced? Are you more experienced than him? I have been observing him for a while After so many years We still can't grow durians like grandpa did Now that Wang Mao Shan is willing to help us We should thank the heavens He said he can do it in 2 to 3 years Mother is right Our durian production is paltry And the flesh isn't beautiful People are lowering our prices all the time Why should we depend on others? Mother you told me to study Agriculture Now that I have graduated why won't you let me handle it? What you studied was only theory Not practical You need to apply it As practical experience Have you forgotten? The last time you said In theory a certain fertiliser was good And we spent a fortune on it Who'd have thought Overnight the trees Were left with no leaves As a result our production was heavily affected Have you really forgotten? Stop scolding Ah Liang I was the one who gave him the idea We have Fengshou Yuan's best intentions at heart If you work with Old Wang We cannot turn back any more Once we get used to it We'll have to depend on others forever Who told you to depend on him forever? Can't you learn and improve? If Old Wang were to be our consultant How much do we need to pay him? He has a name Wang Mao Shan He said we only need to pay for the fertiliser And nothing else Where else can we find such a good opportunity? He had a good suggestion too That once our quality improves We can consider integrated management Integrated management? What if he decides to take over Fengshou Yuan for himself? How are we going to answer to Grandpa? He is helping us out of goodwill Let's not be so cynical Have you tried the durians from his plantation? In this area His durian is probably the best So it's decided End of conversation And you If you have the plantation's interests at heart You need to learn from him A free teacher is hard to come by I'm done eating Forget it Let's listen to Mum first Let's focus on learning All of Wang Mao Shan's Tricks of the trade Haven't you heard? Once the disciple is learned The Master starves I agree with Ah Mei Haven't you heard? Jay Chou said to listen to my mother You can't go wrong Big Sis you don't understand Human beings improved because The new generation Refused to listen to the old one Understand? I grew up alongside the durian plantation No matter how big the wind and rain Everyone look This tree is dead Why is it dead? Look it's diseased No one cured it It died from disease Have you realised Even though the tree is dead There are still leaves attached? Because it died a terrible death And you were the cause of its death If I were you I would bow to it To show remorse Go ahead and atone for your sins This algae need not be removed So the durians will grow well and nicely shaped Understand? Just like that Uncle Mao Shan Got involved in Fengshou Yuan And taught us how to improve the quality of our durians He taught us how to treat problematic trees This tree has a canker Also known as the "Yellow Leaf Disease" Tie the bag of medicine to the tree Keep it in the shade As long as you do it correctly In 3 weeks this tree Will be fully cured We learned what fertilizer to use and how to use it In order to get high quality Musang King Falling for its fragrance Its fragrance With everyone's hard work In just 3 years We saw our durian trees Start to bear fruit agin Just like Second Sis said We took it as a chance to learn his tricks of the trade To hopefully Beat him in the future And let him lose more than what he has gained Although Second Sis and I are not very receptive To Uncle Mao Shan being our durian consultant As we think he is after our mother As well as the durian plantation Hard husk with thorns Extreme appearance Not caring what others think The king of fruits The durian fragrance wafts over A melody that shakes the heavens Sis The durian fragrance wafts over An aroma that reaches our lips Musang King is the star of durians And has a lot of die-hard fans Just like some celebrities They need special care and attention Every tree needs one on one attention and lots of care If you occasionally neglect it It will start to get cranky It is known to have a short temper Once it throws a tantrum An entire season's worth of work will go to waste However under Uncle Mao Shan's guidance This will not happen We are cautious against him But also grateful for his help Isn't it ironic? Not half bad Three years later Ah Soon give it to him This good stuff is yours Everyone likes it I'm sure the price will be higher this time I'll go and pray to Goddess Guanyin For her protection Bless us please I will go pray to Tua Pek Kong later To reinforce it with a double blessing Power Liang Come over This is awesome Everyone likes our durian Everyone is praising it This is great Thankfully we have Goddess Guanyin and Tua Pek Kong's blessing For the fruit to be so good this year We have someone experienced helping us Which saved us from a lot of mistakes Hurry up And say thank you The durian has fallen There's so many Never mind Once this goes out let me tell you All the durian sellers in Malaysia will go crazy Are we really going to go ahead with this? Who cares? We cannot depend on others all the time Aren't you afraid? What's there to be afraid of? You have Second Sis I will be responsible for anything Your sister is so awesome I also want a sister like her Let's start our livestream And stop chit-chatting Ready To all durian sellers I am Liang I am Mei This is our first livestream It might be awkward But we hope you can understand Look at our durian Do you see that Look at its flesh, its colour, its quality I guarantee it is delectable Look at this The most important thing is Our unbeatable wholesale prices Pretending you don't exist While stocks last Contact us immediately Someone asked if we can send to Singapore? Singapore? Yes My phone battery will run out Return me the phone Friends in Singapore If you buy our durian wholesale We're in trouble Remember to comment What are you doing? Are you sick of living? Give it to me Stop it Why were you doing a livestream? Why did you do it? It was just for fun Are you looking for a beating? Just for fun Didn't you just say that Our success is because of Goddess Guanyin's blessing? She's blessing us now We lowered the price by 10 dollars Everyone is kneeling in jubilation Don't mention Goddess Guanyin’s name in vain If we offend them No one can help us Haven't you always 我Wanted to expand Fengshou Yuan? This is our new idea And it can really help us Shut your mouth Don't you know There's a set of rules for the durian industry And it's been like that for decades You cannot just bend the rules Uncle either support us Or shut up What kind of attitude is that? Why are you always letting him bully us? You are scared of anything And everything If you really want me to expand Fengshou Yuan Can you just trust me to do it? The old people's way is outdated Our way of doing things now Is to put an early end to their career Oh my goodness So the three of us are already past our prime And you want to end our careers early? Please have a seat inside and have a cup of tea It's more cooling there Excuse me An improved durian variety So you were doing a livestream selling durian here That means You are directly bypassing us And going directly to the consumers? Looks like we no longer have a future in durian Let's go open a cinema instead Uncles and Auntie Since you are here You may as well try our new Musang King Try it And tell us how much it's worth Can you just shut up for once? What do you take me for? This is how you tell us to try your durian? What kind of attitude is this? So rude I am sorry I failed to teach him I apologize Is there a rubbish bin here? Yes there is Luckily I thought of this Help yourselves Try it Uncle Auntie try it You won't know how good it is Until you try it Cool down Are both your plantations managed together? Even better We can consider Dealing with you Both together You want to deal with us? Let's deal with you first But then I'm not sure how Mum will react What's there to be afraid of? She doesn't listen to you anyway We should just let the results speak for themselves That's right We'll make her speechless I'm telling you I got those durians at the back By risking my life To get enough of them from my boss I also want to learn from you And explore new markets If we don't succeed I am doomed We will definitely succeed We will be able to break free from the old fogeys Yes we can do it Let's work together Singapore Over here Hurry up The customers are complaining Is there any more?

The durians I sell And the ones you sell are different What durians are you selling? Soursop So there's no conflict Are you taking me for a fool? Uncle and I have been out begging for forgiveness But you exported to Singapore directly You'll be the death of me But Mum look We earned a lot from exporting directly So what? Mum People still think that my children were poorly brought up Stop hitting her Exporting to Singapore was my idea It has nothing to do with her Do you think you are very smart? By doing this you are making things hard for your mother When I see you and Mum being so submissive And letting those old people bully you You always keep quiet I just wanted to stand up for us The livestream the other day got us buyers from Singapore We can export there ourselves from now on And not rely on those old peoples' distribution channels There are a lot of unwritten rules in the durian business You have just started By being so reckless You could step on a landmine And not even know what happened Boss times have changed As I have said many times There's no new or old generation in the durian business There's only one way and that's to go through them Why? Because that's to standardise the price Some durian merchants in Singapore Constantly try to cap our prices Otherwise every season They try to cut our prices He's right What you don't know is Some unscrupulous merchants Will take the unsold durians And sun them to make the durians spoil To accuse us of giving them bad durians and request a refund Don't you understand? Uncle Liu and his team Are here to settle such situations Now that you're pricing it as you want You'll throw the market into chaos And all the durian farmers in Malaysia Will hate us to the core With my experience and network Did you think I lacked the ability to export durians myself? I just do not want to offend them Otherwise there will be no end to it And the trouble isn't worth it Take my advice please Your company got even bigger And doing better than 3 years ago What are you here for? Have you been sacked again? I sacked my boss I said it first And broke up with him Aren't you something? Why are you here then? To be business partners Don't tell me it's about durian again Yes Yes the durian business Haven't I told you countless times Durians aren't as profitable as you'd think Don't be unrealistic with your expectations Look at my success today It's not because of two words Dumb luck My success today is because of one word Hard work That's two words That's not the matter You may not succeed if you work hard But to succeed you have to work hard I know things aren't going smoothly for you now Take it easy Remember Failure is not permanent Understand? I don't Mr. Ong Kim Shui Hello Mr. Ong You have signed the agreement with my company And we are now going to remove All your valuables Was that what I signed earlier? Yes Who are you?

Shut up Don't pretend none of this happened You can ask our old neighbours The old neighbours Are either dead or senile Did you not understand what I said earlier? Are you senile too? With only 3 of us now I am telling you This was what really happened You have a screw loose I've told you many times that the plantation is unprofitable You should sell the plantation away We take the money and move to Kuala Lumpur What's the use of keeping this dreaded thing? This is what my dad left us I am his only child Who else can keep it going? It's meant to be passed on to future generations We can't sell it Why not grow oil palm instead? That's troublesome too I don't have the energy to manage it Let me tell you I have decided to go to Singapore You can stay here with the 3 kids And the loss-making durian plantation And rot together Can you not go? Let go After deducting weekends and public holidays I am only 19 years old Don't waste my youth Tell Dad not to go Bye Dad Don't say goodbye Is that the kind of person I am? Isn't it so?

It must've been your imagination Dad didn't trust you to take good care of Fengshou Yuan Ong Kim Shui You really haven't changed after 20 years You can twist the facts so well And durians can become mangosteens My dad said this back then This Ah Shui is a wastrel He has been eyeing my plantation Remember Do not let him sell my plantation Remember at all costs Do not let him sell my plantation Do not let him sell my plantation Do not let him sell my plantation Dad Why wasn't I present either? Are you making things up? He will never call me a wastrel Do you know how bossy you were back then? So you abandoned your wife and children Because you found me bossy? Not only that You were overbearing, pushy, and a tyrant Are you cognizant? I don't know But... Shut up this is our domestic affair I'm glad I came back Else my wife would've been snatched away And I would be none the wiser I did not snatch your... Shut up You didn't? Weren't you kneeling down and proposing earlier? Shut up Who do you think you are to criticize us? Us? Is your brain damaged? Defending an outsider? My brain was indeed water damaged For me to have married you Ong Kim Shui After marrying you My life was nothing but sweat and tears Okay I, Wang Mao Shan, am a morally upright person I understand the relationship here And I feel that any further involvement from me is unneeded I feel You should sit down and have a good talk Just like that Just like that? You want to learn from this irresponsible man Who abandoned his wife and kids? My goodness It's actually the woman pestering the guy It's none of your business Business? I am your husband None of my business Ong Kim Shui I want to file for a divorce So here it comes You want to divorce me to marry him Liu Mei Lian Do you know that he wants to be with you Solely because of your plantation? Not you Don't... Shut up I'm innocent Shut up Even if that happens The plantation still belongs to me Liu Mei Lian And it has nothing to do with you I have also contributed to this plantation If you want to marry him Here's the deal The durian plantation We'll split it Whatever he wants can be taken from your half Now We know what is your purpose here Ong Kim Shui You came back only because the price of Musang King is high And you want your share of the plantation Boss They are all here Uncle Liu you're here Both of you are here Uncle Liu I have already apologised For the livestream incident That was in the past I heard that You directly exported goods to Singapore Uncle Liu It was us who did that It has nothing to do with my mum Don't make it hard on her I know you guys are well respected but We can run our own business And not necessarily follow your rules You want to talk about rules? Let me tell you we make the rules The durians are grown by us So why should we follow your rules? Look A university graduate talks differently I know you studied that agri... Agriculture Agriculture Why are you cursing at me? No Agriculture A degree to learn the science of agriculture Agriculture I see Agriculture Let's see how you do that now Uncle Liu I just feel that the durian market Should be priced according to demand and supply Why is it you 3 old people... Old people? 3 elders setting the price? You guys seem so free all the time Chilling in the shade with coffee and snacks We work hard to grow durian How is this fair? We are all very unhappy Everyone? That's right Do you mean this entire group Of plantation owners? Are you unhappy? If you are step out No no Anyone? No See I've proven you wrong No one's unhappy Spouting rubbish as you like Uncle Liu Even if you could stop us today You can't stop the new era from approaching Do you know? With the help of the internet Customers will soon be buying directly from us When the time comes We do not need people like you any longer Just wait Soon you will be out of a job This is a suggestion for you To keep up with the times Don't be rude Mum I will discipline them My apologies No worries A melon forced off the vine won't be sweet We have quarreled so many times But nothing came out of it Today our partnership Will come to an end The end These kids are trying to teach me how to sell durian I've eaten more durian than you have rice Let's go Let's not do this We can still negotiate Uncle Liu Seeya We are doomed Everything escalated so quickly And we got blacklisted All thanks to you two Big Sis what are you afraid of? Don't we have the chance to export to Singapore now? But Dad just had to come back at this time And add fuel to the fire When we see him we must ask Why he abandoned us back then Cross the road Are we here? Yes let's go Sit All of you have grown up You're helping out at home after completing your studies Big Sis has gotten married And has a beautiful daughter It's been 20 years It's been hard on you all So why did you abandon us back then? It's a long story Make it quick Mother fierce Father ran Not that short You can elaborate slightly Back then Your mother was very bossy And never treated me as her husband She scolded me whether or not I was in the wrong But your grandpa was there to hold her back Once he passed away I was all alone I am a man after all I have my pride She wasn't only bossy back then She's still like that now Wrong She was scarier back then Shortly after I left I mustered up the courage to return once But you know what she said to me? What? She told me to scram And that I should die before coming back unsuccessful I should die That's what she said I am a man after all Men have their pride? Yes exactly This is father-daughter telepathy I kept calling home But your mother refused to pick up the phone And ended up changing her number So we lost contact for 20 years Now that you're back Are you successful now? These are all the companies that I started in Singapore One a year And once I started 3 companies in a year So many? You should be very rich now But all of them have closed down Don't react that way I poured my heart and soul into every company If you're not successful why are you back? I came back this time to have a family reunion That is my biggest wish It's not because of the plantation Looking at others having happy families I don't want you to feel like you don't have a father And that I have no children even though I do I want to come back to my roots Look When I left I brought your photo along So that I can see all of you everyday This is Ah Liang Yes it is him This looks like me You were mischievous when you were young Big Sis this is you Back when you were thinner Am I very fat now? I am very happy to see you all like this But I believe Your mother won't let you see this photo So what are your plans for now? I initially had no plans But now my plan would be To prevent Fengshou Yuan From getting usurped by that Mao Shan I am also worried about that This is the father and son singing the same tune We have the same DNA And same surname Uncle Mao Shan has the surname Wang too Is that so? Why did he copy our surname? That's different He's Old Wang from next door I feel like it's also because of Mum's bossiness That we were unable to prevent Uncle Mao Shan From getting involved with Fengshou Yuan Mum has the best intentions for Fengshou Yuan Without him no one would improve our durian We know We know but Mum does not see the risks associated with it Why does everyone know about the risks associated But not you? Even though my businesses in Singapore all collapsed But I still know a thing or two about doing business This time I need to help Fengshou Yuan carve a plan out And we can have our family reunion at the same time What plan? Please don't tell me It's one of those ancient over-used plans The old way is outdated We need to be ahead of the curve I was too ahead of the times in Singapore And they couldn't keep up I have my own ways What ways? E-commerce See We need to use E-commerce Else we'd be shortchanging ourselves We can even find people to adopt a durian tree Which is like a shared equity scheme And reduce our risks Exactly And we can expand overseas Export directly to Singapore Then we can move on to China Yes But when I saw how your mother Has been suppressing you Like Sun Wukong under the Five Finger Mountain The idea was awesome But you couldn't implement it Ah Liang's method disregarded the industry practices And it has severe consequences Industry practices? You need to know Rules are meant to be broken What do you mean? Rules are meant to be broken What do you mean? No let me explain He meant that rules are meant to be broken Something like that will do But you need to know Mankind is only able to improve Because the younger generation refuses to listen to the older one So we need to be daring Sis That was what Ah Liang said Like I said Within us flow the same "juice" That's disgusting Can we have the same blood instead? Blood is original "Juice" is what Singaporeans say But don't worry I will not Let Fengshou Yuan fall into the hands of that guy Let's get our mother back And protect Fengshou Yuan from others Come What? Big Sis what we discussed today should be kept from Mum Of course Do I look like that kind of person? Mother What? Mother I am risking my life to tell you this Ah Liang and Ah Mei Have decided to collude with Dad To deal with... Uncle Mao Shan Me? How? Like in a triad? This Kim Shui The moment he came back He split my family up I can't figure out You were all brought up by me Why are they so close to a stranger? I feel that Promise you won't be angry I'll hit myself first I feel that Usually no matter what they do You... You two shoot them down immediately And that's why that man has the chance What they did Caused Fengshou Yuan to be blacklisted Should I be praising them instead? Now that they have grown up They think they can do whatever they want They'll be the death of me Don't be angry Let me tell you A harmonious family is the best Quarrelling brings nothing Ever since my wife left I mean like actually passed away After that I came to realize A family being together is the best And that's the real happiness You need to cherish it These two damn kids Will be the death of me Mum don't be angry your wrinkles are out You forgot to take this in the morning What is it? It's good for your skin I'm the one who sold durians to you in Singapore The last time, Ah Liang You already have enough stock? Bring in all the durians outside else they will go bad You already imported stock from someone else? Our price is still negotiable Those unscrupulous durian stalls In the next town Do not dare to take our durian now Those that dare to, only see it as a chance To lowball us Why not we lower our price even further? What's the point? Who dares to buy durian from us? Now you know the influence of "2 Kings and 1 Queen" Don't worry you have me I will take care of this Don't worry See? You still need Uncle to clear up your mess Uncle Dong Yes We've been friends for so long I'll be frank We have a lot of Musang King Yes You decide the price We've given you a good price Ok It's okay I have more contacts Uncle Hui has been in the durian industry in Singapore For over 20 years No matter which corner of Singapore you want to sell to He has the connections for it Those 3 darn old people Of all the durian sellers in Singapore There isn't one that doesn't hate them Because they caused the price of durian in Singapore To increase exponentially However we have no choice But now you have me Their ancestors did not look over them Singapore Simon The durians are here Welcome Ah Liang Welcome Shui Mei I always thought you were useless But I need to thank you this time In Singapore I know every durian stall owner We drink coffee together and are good buddies As long as I call them They will agree to it right away Why are you crying? Look at my kids I didn't help raise them at all Now they know how to do business themselves I am very touched yet guilty I shouldn't have left them for so long I am such a rotten person Why are you crying? I am not crying I'm just touched Touched? They're my kids not yours Why are you touched? It's because My dream all along Was to become a durian supplier It has finally come true Is it that satisfying? Of course I had to curry favour with the customers And with my boss as well It's different now They have to curry favour with me instead Even my ex-boss Do you know how satisfying that feels? You won't know Good for you Dad I am very touched too What is it now? Just because of this small amount? Because we've proven one thing In the durian industry Those old folks are no longer the be all end all See we have our own market now Yes I am also thinking Once we pass this money to Mum My 2 darlings In such difficult times You can still make so much money Amazing I am so happy Let's make it clear All your future durian exports to Singapore Will all be handled by me Also All the durian pricing in Singapore Will be fixed by me No need to depend on someone else Ok? Deal From what you're saying We don't need Wang Mao Shan either As long as we stay united as a family We'll be invincible That's right I forgot you're here Let's go and have Hainanese Chicken Rice Let's go We can supply Our own durians ourselves Fengshou Yuan won't collapse after all Collapsed I will hit that damn mouth of yours What I meant was someone collapsed on the road Really? There's someone else in front who collapsed Maybe from heat stroke? A disease that is suspected to originate from bats Has spread to our shores Some of the infected have difficulty breathing And may even collapse without warning The Ministry of Health has warned that If you have uncommon cold and fever symptoms Please head to a government hospital immediately Why did this happen? Who told you to find him for help? I don't want such money Mother When our durians couldn't get sold We were all very worried Why are you still angry now That we have sold out? I'd rather the durians rot Than rely on that man Why do you have go against my wishes? Mum I beg you Please look at the bigger picture The feud is between you and Dad Is a private matter between you two Our durians being unsold is a Fengshou Yuan matter Can you separate public and private interests? When we asked Dad for help He helped us without any complaints Complaints? Do you think he dares complain? Mum Now we know Why Dad left all those years ago Because in this house No matter if we're right or wrong You only ever reprimand us Now I'm the worst person in the world And he's the best You've only known him for a few days And already you are brainwashed Do you like him that much? Go move in with him This is my home Scram Scram Yes Dad is a bad person Only your Wang Mao Shan is a good person Say that again Wang Mao Shan Who's talking about me? Boss I am back Look at you sending durians to Singapore Who arranged it? Through Ah Liang's dad and the short Ah Hui's connections Kim Shui? Yes Where do I stand on this? You took our durians to him And begged him to export them to Singapore? No I did not Our durians were sold to our old customers Ah Liang's dad sold Fengshou Yuan's durian Boss don't worry I got your back Actually they aren't wrong in doing this Father and children in unity Forget it Wives of pals are off-limits But he's not your pal So It's not your pal's wife Might as well go ahead with it So you want me to be known for snatching his wife? Boss are you retreating? Let me analyse it for you Once you give up You lose the girl As well as the collaboration between the two plantations You'll be back to square one When you come home Light a joss stick and tell your wife you're back And drink stout till you're drunk Then rinse and repeat The same old things every day Do you want to do this for the rest of your life? But what did you say? Joss sticks? Tua Pek Kong I have known Liu Mei Lian for 3 years We like each other very much However her husband came back all of a sudden I want to know if I should persist or move on? If I persist Am I snatching his wife? If you agree to me snatching someone's wife Please give me a positive sign See that Tua Pek Kong doesn't approve When you ask like that If I were Tua Pek Kong I wouldn't approve either I was being honest We can't lie to a deity right? I am not telling you to lie But you need to have a way with words So smart You do it Let me But wait If I talk to Tua Pek Kong And he gives me a positive sign Does that mean I have to marry her? I can't handle that I will die What should I do then? Let's try it again from the top Let me ask if I have any fate with Liu Mei Lian If so, please give me 3 positive signs I told you All 3 times were positive signs Congratulations You've passed three stages of approval In summary You are not snatching someone's wife The two of you are fated And the people up there approve Nine-generation romance Mei Lian My friend organised all this today And they're organizing even more Don't worry about business I noticed Ah Liang and you Are still on bad terms I feel that you need to encourage him more Or he will get even closer to his dad And distance himself from us Oh yes The pandemic is so serious now You need to wear a mask Even money can't buy this now I kept this from when I was painting Come Remember to wear this when going into Singapore You need to wear it too Come and put one on Wear it properly This Ah Liang The pandemic is rampant now And the economy is bad But we have a bumper harvest of durian What should we do? Mum come over Don't ripen so quickly I can't sell you even if you're ripe And have to bury you anyway Exactly We don't know when this pandemic will end Boss What happened? You are so flustered Your son has fainted Ah Liang Mum Don't go near Ah Liang He may have contracted COVID COVID? We should quickly call an ambulance And send him to the hospital Yes If it ends up being COVID No one can go near him The safest way is to go to the hospital Are you crazy? Stay away from him Go away Don't send me to the hospital If I do have COVID You are all close contacts And need to be quarantined If all our durians Have to be destroyed We are doomed Yes What if it is not COVID And he goes into the hospital Only to get infected there instead? That's right Haven't you seen the news? Those who died in the hospital Could not even see their families one last time And had to be cremated immediately If we don't send him to the hospital And can't get close to him Who will take care of him? Don't worry Second Sis will take care of you Hold it I will do it Step back Wear your mask Grandma Didn't you say you don't want Uncle anymore? Why are you still taking care of him? Keep quiet He caught COVID as he was maskless Come on Yes yes Mum Hold on Hold on Mum don't come closer I am afraid of getting you infected Go out Sit up Don't be silly I can look after myself Who will take care of you if I don't? You'll be fine Clear out I am making my way in Everyone go into your rooms Everyone I made this breakfast myself Remember this virus Attacks those with a weaker immune system So you need to eat a filling and proper breakfast Understood? Understood Thank you Leave it outside I will go and take it after you leave Okay Boss we forgot to buy coffee If you all are hungry You can come out and take it now Mei Lian yours is already at your door Let me go make some coffee If you want coffee after your meal You can have it any time Are you ready? 1, 2, 3 We are moving You can hurry and come out now Someone else is coming Everyone I made this breakfast myself This virus attacks those with a weaker immune system So you need to eat a filling and proper breakfast Understood? After I leave you can come out and take your food I forgot to buy coffee What are you doing here? We're under MCO now Ah Mei told me Ah Liang is sick As his dad I have the right to visit him Why can that guy be here but I can't? He's not here His damn car is so big Do you think I'm blind? And your masks are old They will expire Even money can't buy this in Malaysia now I haven't finished talking don't close the door It took me great effort to get this box Use it It's very expensive Yes In the past you wore a mask to rob the bank Now selling masks is more profitable than robbing a bank Ah Liang You need to get well soon And protect Fengshou Yuan Don't let someone snatch it from you, understand? Visitation hours are over Please leave Why do you keep holding the fan? Just so you know By doing this When the virus approaches It gets blown towards you Liang rest well Have you been infected by me? Don't let them hear I'm fine Let me pour you a glass of water Do you feel any better? I never expected that a small virus Can be so powerful Don't worry Even if I get infected I am already a grandma I've received more than I could even have asked for Don't say such things Life is hard to predict I heard that COVID at my age Is a high risk disease But also it's due to this virus That we get to talk like this Usually once we start talking Either you get angry and leave Or I do I know You all find me very bossy But there are many things you don't know As a single mom raising 3 kids Sometimes I have no choice Think about it Since young has anyone dared to bully you? No? Because I blocked it for you How long more can I do that? If anything happens to the family in the future It's your turn to pick up the mantle That's why I have high expectations of you With high expectations My tone tends to become sharp Sorry Mum You've had it rough Sorry Mum Let's give Mum and Ah Liang some space to talk Mummy Is Grandma dying soon? Don't say such stuff You are crying As if Grandma has already died Touch wood Thank you boss It's weird We can buy food but can't dine in This sort of law Is brainless It's the same in Singapore Do they have MCO too? It's not MCO In Singapore it's CB CB? Yes what about it? So vulgar? Out of all the alphabets they chose these 2 Circuit Breaker Get your mind out of the gutter You should have said it from the start What are you doing? I want to eat here You can't do that I'm starving Don't think that only Singapore has police officers And Malaysia doesn't You'll be in trouble if you get caught We'll find another spot to eat Move What a hungry ghost Eat Ah Liang has been sick for 3 days I wonder if he's feeling better Don't worry he's still young He'll be fine Eat Honestly speaking When my own child is sick and I can't visit him It's heartbreaking It's common for couples to quarrel When Mei Lian scolded me back then I should have just tolerated it Why did I leave? Hello? Mum got it? The lottery? COVID? She's gravely ill? Mum you are still having a high fever Is it very uncomfortable? Go out I will take care of myself Don't be stubborn What if I spread it to you? Mum I have already gotten it and recovered I won't get it again Who else will take care of you if not me? No one knows for sure This virus is very cunning Mum Come have some water I am not afraid of death I'm just afraid I can't see you and Ah Mei get married And see Xiao Li and the rest grow up I won't go in peace Try not to speak too much Take a rest Ah Liang It's all too short Don't say that please It can't even cover my feet You're referring to the blanket You scared me For your mum Rascal You come to my house as you like What do you take me for? What do you think MCO is for? You're in the wrong too Why? Ah Lian is my legally wedded wife Am I wrong in coming home? Why did you close the door on me? It's not that I don't want you to come in It's what Mei Lian wants If she told you to eat faeces would you do so? Please don't make things difficult for me I'm telling you it's MCO now It's illegal for you to come Isn't that the same for you It's alright Since he's refusing to open the door I'll start a livestream Good idea Let's do it now My phone battery is flat We'll pretend to livestream Okay I am starting now Make him infamous MCO in effect But he is in someone else's home Come film his car too Got it Let Wang Mao Shan faint and become rusty Film it all Let them enter Mum says to let him in Mei Lian said you can come in Safe distancing please Luckily I can charge my phone here Is she still in that room?

Dad Of course we'd like our family to be whole But Uncle Mao Shan Has really helped us a lot How can we get him to back away? But we cannot just let him leave Why? Else who would manage our livestream? He was the one who did everything I thought it was some life or death matter Those aren't issues I have done business in Singapore for so many years I can settle this no problem I feel that we need to wait a bit longer Well let me ask you a question Once your durians ripen and fall Can you wait a few days hoping to sell at a higher price? Can you? No Now your dad is the durian that has ripened and dropped Don't you have to sell him right away for the best price? Yes If not the white-haired man will have tricks up his sleeve And your dad's good name Will turn into sewage water This can't happen I need to discuss with your mum Let's go Sha Bao hurry and remember to take the computer Coming What's up? Where's my wife? She's in the plantation Good that she's not here You may as well have a man to man talk Do not fight Do not quarrel I am the referee okay? Okay Wang Mao Shan I know you are rich and powerful But can you not snatch my wife? Don't blindly accuse me I did not snatch your wife Mei Lian and I Are just like anyone out there In a normal relationship I did not hold her at knifepoint I helped her improve her durians And we developed feelings over time How can you call it snatching? Help? You made it sound like you contributed a lot to this family My contribution isn't massive But it's more than yours Do you know who paid for Liang's university fees? Of course I know, do you? Of course I know, do you? Let's say it together on the count of 3 1, 2, 3 Durian Association Scholarship Okay you do know You too So you do know that This has nothing to do with you? It has nothing to do with you either When you weren't around my boss did a lot for lady boss Where's the proof? Only a ghost would know Yes only a ghost would know I don't know if the ghosts know or not But the deities definitely know I'll have you know I prayed to Tua Pek Kong 3 times And it was all positive signs Even Tua Pek Kong agrees That Mei Lian and I are fated We can be together forever Where's the proof? Show me You want proof? Let me show you This is the Seng Puey Not only did you steal my wife You even stole Tua Pek Kong's Seng Puey? This is from my house I didn't steal it We are going to have a man to man talk If he becomes rash you need to stop him for me Got it Honestly speaking As a man Don't waste your time here Go back to Singapore Find someone to marry And convert your Permanent Resident status To Singapore Citizen Isn't that what you want? Whether or not I want to be a Singapore citizen Is none of your business You said Tua Pek Gong gave you 3 positive signs Does that mean that He agrees to you snatching my wife? It's not like that How do I put it? Wang Mao Shan If I didn't love Mei Lian any more I wouldn't say a word But since the beginning I have always loved her You say you love her But your words alone don't count for anything If my words don't count for anything Should I perform it for you to see? I love her more than anyone else Since you don't believe What Tua Pek Kong approved of Why not you ask Tua Pek Kong yourself? Ask Tua Pek Kong There's no Tua Pek Kong here Goddess Guanyin is in the same department It'll do Do you dare to? It's the same if you ask the Goddess Guanyin The answer will be the same Do you want to try? Don't try and play me Whatever you ask she will say OK Is that so? See for yourself I didn't notice after so many years Do you dare to? You're on Let's go Come on You both have a combined age of over 100 years Do you have to be so childish? The questions that humans can't answer Can only be left to the gods Then ask Goddess Guanyin When will the MCO end? Okay? Boss the Goddess Guanyin is very good She came the moment we summoned her And left after saying her piece Just like that He might snatch my wife away I know Before I came here He has already complained to you But if you are God Don't believe in his nonsense I am very confused now Please give me some advice Tua Pek Kong Let's see if the past 20 years' bond Will bear any fruit Whether or not The lovers will be locked to each other Dad It's 'To belong to each other' Whatever the two words are like twins Please please It's a very auspicious lot Your longing can't be denied Distance doesn't separate you Being apart for 20 years To overcome are many obstacles This is very deep What does it mean? Let me have a look Do you know how to read it? I used to interpret lots at the Waterloo Street temple It says How do I read this? Let me see It says You miss Mum a lot Even though you were away for ages You still have feelings for her right? After being apart for so long Even if there's a wall separating you both It's an obstacle that you need to overcome The meaning is obvious Don't be afraid of the wall Don't delay let's go Yes That's exactly what I wanted to say Tua Pek Kong is so accurate Very Let's ask again and confirm again Let's go Give the lot to me Little brother we are doomed It's a very auspicious lot here And 3 positive signs there Who should our mum marry? I don't know either We'll play by ear This is crazy Why are you kneeling down? Oh right Since you have knelt down don't stand up Should I kneel or not? Just kneel Tua Pek Kong If this good lot is the right one I am just being careful I need to confirm a couple more times A positive sign Thank you Tua Pek Kong We have good and cheap stuff to recommend you today Remember to like and share We have over 10,000 viewers now Come it's today's special Bring the “durians” out Mum come This is my wife Let me tell you She's beautiful isn't she? The reason I came back is to treat her well Let me tell you that your orders And your durians are packed with these Silky smooth pair of hands You'll feel sweet after eating it Why did it disconnect? Hold on Reconnect it Stop Why are you spouting nonsense during the livestream? I was telling the truth Ong Kim Shui I feel that you are not gentlemanly enough I've told you many times Why don't you understand The fate between Mei Lian and I Is validated through Tua Pek Kong's three positive signs Got it? I also prayed to Tua Pek Kong And also got three positive signs Both of you Are my business partners You Ong Kim Shui You Wang Mao Shan Are the same Why are we the same? I am your husband Mum Wang Mao Shan What? Can you stop coming to my house? If you hadn't appeared I would have made up with Mei Lian long ago Can you not come and snatch my wife? Why did you have to come back? This is my home why can't I come back? Everything will be fine as long as you don't snatch my wife For the nth time, I did not snatch your wife Don't you understand? I did not snatch your wife I did not snatch your wife I did not snatch your wife I did not snatch your wife Whatever you say you still snatched her Please What are you saying? I am back If I'm not here I have nothing to say Xiao Li are you recording Grandpa? I am not recording Okay good I am doing a livestream There's a lot of people watching Over 10,000 viewers Look Watching you both quarrel Are over 10,000 viewers Look Everyone is scolding him What a sore loser Boss Give me a pack of toilet paper Thank you You like snatching things that aren't yours I'm sorry how much is it?

People are scolding him See? He is being scolded Scram you rascal Look That's why I say My netizens have standards And know right from wrong If I knew earlier that she has a husband And continued pursuing her Then I am in the wrong But you need to know That it was Ong Kim Shui Left them for many years He broke off all contact for over 20 years And didn't contribute to the family And left her to bring the kids up by herself He completely distanced himself from the family If you were me Would you let Mei Lian go back to someone like him? We're doomed Look This wretched guy has no idea how to talk Everyone is now scolding your mum And he has sabotaged her Ah Shui he's putting on an act And using Mei Lian As a human shield Despicable Move Damn you That's my phone Sorry Liu Mei Lian did not hide it from me But as he has disappeared for so long She stopped thinking of him long ago Because of this She naturally did not bring this up I do not blame her But you need to know that Ong Kim Shui Left because the durian business was tough And because Musang King is a money maker now He's back To get a slice of the pie The reason he came back was for Musang King Not Liu Mei Lian It's not because of love Although a prodigal who returns is more precious than gold But with Ong Kim Shui don't believe everything you are told He's even rhyming This is declaring war on me right? That won't do Start the livestream Do it No no Give it to me Don't be rash Dad we should finish watching his livestream first Why don't we Look at it from Mei Lian's perspective For comparison If you know that Ong Kim Shui is a kampung durian of poor quality Why wouldn't you chop it down And plant a new varietal? Isn't it right? Ong Kim Shui left for over 20 years And suddenly came back to do a livestream And became popular overnight Like he's a hero But these last few years I've been silently by Mei Lian's side Helping her with the plantation Taking care of her kids and her family My contribution is by no means negligible He came back suddenly And I became a villain who snatched his wife Tell me is this fair towards me? They are saying 'we support you' now Hope you have a successful "regraft" and bear fruits My livestream will end here I will not be entertaining any questions in the future Just this once Thank you all for listening to my explanation Thank you I'm turning it off Boss no You can take a break There's 50,000 viewers Let me take over Hello everyone I am the assistant of Wang Mao Shan From Wang Mao Shan Musang King What's wrong with him?

If they come and save us Mei Lian's house would be gone My idea was that if they save us The 4 of us can help to put out the fire What can those 2 idiots do? Let me tell you In the 20 years I've been in Singapore I've learnt That we should prioritize Efficiency This is what I learnt Understand? In Malaysia we prefer to be Realistic Save lives first Look at the bigger picture Is it wrong to rescue someone first? Also In Malaysia we also have a very powerful saying I help you You help me Heard of that? Come I'm telling you now What?

No matter what your decision is I'll accept it I've decided To give you and Mei Lian my blessings Dad Why?
