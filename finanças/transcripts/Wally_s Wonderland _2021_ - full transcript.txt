Yeah, I tell everybody that attempts the 50, there ain't shit out here, but you gotta be prepared for anything. A bunch of fun-loving kids stole the zigzag out of the back of the sheriff's pickup a month ago. Guess you found it for 'em. You know what some folks consider funny? Just ruin a man's whole damn day. God's honest truth. Now, where'd you say you're from? Oh, you're one of those guys that don't wanna look back, huh? You're one where the past lives in the past, huh? Yeah, I understand. No, I can't blame you. I mean, we all got so much baggage. I just say, move forward. You're a rolling stone. Yup. We had a car chase around here a while back. Some boy got up to 150 miles an hour, just launched it right off Tension's Peak, man. It's like a superhero. It went fwoom! Carnage was terrible. It was just... wow. Oh, fuck me. - Will you just stop it? - Open the door! I'll open the damn door. What the hell is wrong with you? No! God damn it. Hey Jed, what's up? This old boy had the misfortune of finding your zigzags out there. I figured I'd bring 'em back to you. - He all right? - Yeah, he'll be all right. Tire's not, but he'll be fine. He had this pretty Camaro right here. Yes, yes, it was that ocean blue... Jed, I'll come by and get 'em later. All turning around, spinning out, everything. He just slid right in there and then pop, pop... I don't have time for this today, okay? Yes, ma'am. - Take this off me. - Oh, you gotta be kidding me. There's not a chance in hell I'm letting you out of this trailer tonight. I hate you. Oh, talk sweet to me all you want. Get down. You know the drill. Get down. - Get out of my way. - Come here. What the hell are you doing? - Wait. - I'll be back in the morning. What... how the hell am I supposed to eat? How am I supposed to take a piss? There are chips is on the coffee table and a bucket on the floor. Try not to make a mess. You're a bitch. Oh, I love you too. Hey, it's gonna be about $250 for the tow, and we'll need all four tires replaced. And there was something wrong with that chip, I think. But I can fix it for about $1,000. Yep. No, cash only. Uh-uh, no. And in advance. Yeah, I don't take no plastic credit cards. Oh, that over there. Yeah, we ain't got no internet in Hayesville. Yeah, so all the ATMs, they just don't work. Yeah, we were gonna get it, but they just didn't. You ain't got the cash, huh? Now ain't that a dilly of a pickle? Hmm. You willing to work it off? Okay, then. I think I've got somebody who can accommodate. Hey, kid. I got a guy for you. You want god to laugh, you tell him your plans. Howdy there, partner. My name is Tex, same as the state. Got the handle Macadoo. Welcome to Willy's Wonderland. - Yeah, he don't talk much. - And I respect that. I enjoy a man of few words. Well, business is not what it used to be, but I am fixing to reopen and make Willy's better than ever. Anyway, enough horseshit. Here's my offer. You spend the night cleaning Willy's Wonderland and I will pay to have your car fixed. I go on in tomorrow, you come out of there, and your ride will be ready for you right there. Deal?

This stuff oughta do the trick. Broom, mop, bucket, drain snake, Windex, rags, whatever you need, we got it. Oh, lookee here. Congratulations. You are officially on staff.

I can't stand to hear a grown man scream. - Liv, you in there? - Oh, shit. Yeah, I'm in here. Can you help me out? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. - Okay, calm down, dude. No need to be a superhero. - Oh! - Oh, my God. Oh, damn it! Oh! Nice one, genius. The door was unlocked. How am I supposed to know that? Oh, shit. Let me see if we can find something to get you out of that. She gave you a bucket? Bitch is wicked. - Liv, you okay? - Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Just... I found a screwdriver. What the hell are we gonna do with a screwdriver? Have y'all never worn handcuffs before? Oh, shut up. Why not just look for the key? What the hell am I looking in the fridge for? God, these eggs are definitely bad. We need, like, a saw or a pliers or something. - Pliers? - Can't find no key in here. - Shut up and find something. - You shut up! You ain't had no handcuffs on. Gee, thanks for the help, guys. - Cool. We good. - Yo. Come on. We're late. I saw the bait already. Where? Well, he was with Jed in his truck. Probably locked inside Willy's by now. Well, let's roll out. I wanna see that bitch burn. Yeah, burn, baby, burn. Wait, guys, this isn't for your entertainment, okay? It's for doing what's right. It's gotta be a little entertaining. Look, I wanna see them freak bastards die for what I see 'em do. Shut up, dude. What have you seen them do? Remember that one time I was... Okay, shut up. Guys. If we're doing this, we're gonna do this as a mission, not a field trip. Are you with me or not? Yeah, we're with you, Liv. Whatever you say. Yeah. All right. Let's do this. I'm gonna feast on your face! Sheriff, if I may, why'd you request the state to send backup for one night to curfew a place the size of a postage stamp? Oh, don't get me wrong. I got a wife and kid on the way and I do love the overtime pay. - Double overtime. - Right. So what's the plan the rest of the evening? - See that phone? - Yeah.

That if you clean up the place tonight, they'll pay to have your tires fixed by morning, right? It's a lie. They've said the same story to countless other over the last 20 years. They baited you. You're here to be a human sacrifice. You're here to be eaten and killed. Do you understand that? This town has a dark history. And it all starts with this horrible place. You know, Willy's may seem like a happy-go-lucky child's play place, but it's much, much more than that. Willy's was built in 1996, the brainchild of Jerry Robert Willis. If that name sounds familiar to you, it should. Jerry was one of the last century's most sick and sadistic serial killers. Jerry spent most of the time cultivating similar sickos. I mean, these were the most depraved people you could ever imagine. Often, Jerry and his crew would whisk away unsuspecting families to the Super Happy Fun Room. Once inside, the families would be treated to a birthday cake and a private show by Willy Weasel. The shows would always end the same way. After numerous missing persons reports and suspicious smells coming from the inside of Willy's, the law felt it was time to investigate. Jerry and his gang refused to be taken alive. After the police finally entered the Super Happy Fun Room, they discovered that Jerry and his crew had performed a satanic suicide ritual. Instead of surrendering, the killers decided to take their own lives. Those familiar with satanic rituals speculate that the suicide ritual was some sort of a Katra transfer of energy where the memory and consciousness of the living relocate into non-living entities. In this case, the animatronic robots. Ten years later, Willy's reopens with a new owner, Tex Macadoo. He tries to keep the current public unaware of its horrific past. Things are wrong from the start. There's reports that the creatures would move on their own. Some would say things they weren't programmed to say. Wanna fuck, fatty? And others would kill and feast on customers. After several ghastly incidents, Willy's closes its doors again. But Tex still doesn't bulldoze it to the ground. Why, you may ask? Because Willy got to him. Convinced him to make a deal with the devil. Along with all those other backwoods inbreds in this sorry town. Speaking of backwoods inbreds, where'd Bob and Kathy go? Whoa. This is where it actually happened. This is where those kid killers offed themselves. Oh. Cool. The fuck? Okay, yeah, this is... this is weird as fuck. Yo, who the hell bringing their kids up in here? Shit, not my kids. Not our kids. Is it weird that I'm getting really turned on right now? Oh, you a freak freak. It's never seemed to bother you before. Who says it bothers me now? Hmm. Happy birthday, baby. It's not my birthday. I still wanna see you in your birthday suit. Have you been listening to a word I've been saying? Look at all these naughty birthday boys - and birthday girls. - Oh, shit. I think it's time for them to go nightie night. ♪ It's your birthday and we want you to have fun ♪ ♪ It's your birthday, so let's kill everyone ♪ ♪ Six little chickens at the end of the line ♪ ♪ Six little chickens at the end of the line ♪ ♪ One happy weasel says, "It's dinner time" ♪ ♪ Six little chickens oughta be just fine ♪ ♪ Six little chickens in the weasel's den ♪ ♪ Four little roosters and a couple of hens ♪ ♪ Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide ♪ ♪ Six little chickens at the end of the line ♪ ♪ Six little chickens ♪ Watch out, now! ♪ Six little chickens ♪ Here comes the weasel! ♪ Six little chickens running outta time ♪ Whoops! ♪ Five little chickens at the end of the line ♪ - Shit! - What the... holy fuck!

It's staring at us. Well, then let's give it a show. What you talking about? Come on. Get nasty with it. - Hayesville Sheriff's Office. - Sheriff? This is Sheriff Lund. It's Chris Muley. What can I do you for, Chris? Christ, I did something stupid. We're at Willy's. Prank call. You want me to get that? People made their beds, they gotta lie in 'em. Pretty sure the saying is, "Protect and Serve," Sheriff. Shut your mouth, smart guy. You're not funny. Liv brought us here. Son of a bitch. Get your asses out of there, son. Put your balls on, Evan. We're going to Willy's. Bobby, that thing just moved! Where the fuck did it go? No! No! I really need you to help me find my friends. Please. Oh, my God. Kathy! Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Hello, little boy. You don't have to be afraid of me. I'm not the same as the others. They're so mean to me. They call me ugly and they make fun of my colorful skin. I'm trapped in this body. I just want to be free. I guess I don't expect you to believe me. I hoped that you were different. I'm Chris. Trust me, Chris. You know you can. You can feel my goodness. If what you're saying is true, and you're not like the others... I could help you get to the next life? It's true. Evil has kept me here. You must have questions. I can tell you so much about the other side. I can answer all your questions. If you can help me. You ever use your sidearm? Oh. In training. But these are just punk kids, right? What, vandalizing and loitering? I doubt we'll need to drop 'em. It's not the kids. It's Willy. The dancing rat? Okay. I get it. I get it. The boys told you to pull a fast one on me. Bravo. Nice try. It ain't no prank. This is real as it gets. I guaran-damn-tee you that. See, in town, we knew what was happening at Willy's. We knew there was something supernatural going on. We bellowed to the high heavens that the machines were evil. No one believed us. They thought we were yokels. Tex eventually hired a demolition crew to destroy Willy's, except the day before bulldozers were set to roll, Eric Miller, the contractor, was found in bed as chewed up as a McDonald's hamburger. His whole family too. After that, there wasn't a man alive that would take the job. The town decided that maybe it was better to let sleeping dogs lie. We told everybody just to stay away from there. We figured we'd just let it rot. But rabid dogs don't sleep when they're hungry. The machines got out. We found bodies at the ice cream shop, the hardware store, and even the school. We had a real Hobson's choice on our hands. You know what that is? No. No choice at all. We could either go to war with the machines, come off like crazy people, probably lose a lot of good folk along the way, or... Or what? We cut a deal. Leave our people be. Leave our children be. Leave our town be, and... and we will feed you. Well, the good news is, I can fix it. The bad news is, it's gonna have to sit till I get the part. Now, Hayesville's one hotel's booked. But I do have a place you can stay tonight. Now, it ain't the Ritz, but it's a roof and it's free if you're willing to do a little light cleaning. Best place for a birthday party you've ever seen. Heck, it once was, but we're gonna fix it. Bring her back to life. Congratulations. You are officially on staff. We lived up to our end of the bargain and they kept theirs. We tried to find people who wouldn't be missed. People with low moral character. And some people who were just at the wrong place at the wrong time. Things didn't always go exactly as planned. I usually pride myself on being able to expect the unexpected. But sometimes, life throws you a zinger. Well, this was the zinger of all zingers. Good night, darling. Sweet dreams. I never saw it coming. So that's why we're going? Liv. Much as she pisses me off, I couldn't live with losing that girl. I can show you what's on the other side. If you could help me get there. - Oh, Chris. - Liv, Liv, it's gonna be okay. Kay, we're gonna make a deal and... Wanna play, bitch? Playtime's over now, girlfriend. Drop the lizard. Get that stuff off of her. Willy, I'm so sorry about this prick. Eloise, please, stop. He's a good guy. Shut your yap and get outside. They killed some of 'em. Oh. Stupid idiots. It'll just incite him more. Willy, this guy does not act for us. His actions should in no way reflect on the town of Hayesville. You know that, right, Willy? Well, cuff him. For God's sakes, cuff him. No way. I'm not leaving him here. I'll give you two reasons why you are: your wife and your kid. If we don't do what needs to be done, nobody in this county is safe. Why couldn't you just die? Where are the others? They're dead. Stupid kids. Do you see? Okay, time to go. - Go. - No. Uh-uh. I'm not leaving without him. I'm not giving you a choice. Go. - I'm not leaving without him. - Get out of here. You don't understand. You've locked the wrong guy up in here. He's not trapped in here with them. They're trapped in here with him. Not for much longer. I'm sorry son. Is that what you did to my parents? You're a monster. What do we do now? Well, I'm gonna wait here until this problem solves itself. You drop her off in a cell, come back, and get me. Should be done by then. Hey, cowboy.
