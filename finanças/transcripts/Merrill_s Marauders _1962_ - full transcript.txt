January 1942. The high water Mark of Nazi conquest. Hitler's armies hammered at the gateway to the near east. Their Japanese allies poured across Asia an irresistible flood of men and weapons... driving to link up with the Germans to the west, crushing the world between them. Sweeping into Burma, they captured the vital air base at Myitkyina and cut the Burma road. Our forces, pitifully weak, retreated along elephant trails, through jungles... across rivers and mountains to the temporary refuge of India. General Joseph Stilwell said the last word on the campaign. I claim we got a hell of a beating. We got run out of Burma and it's humiliating as hell. I think we ought to find out what caused it, go back and retake the place. Meeting in Quebec... president Roosevelt and prime minister Churchill gather their strength. To India, they sent our men. Irish, English, Scot and welsh, Australian, New Zealander, Gurkha, Sikh. And from the United States came 3,000 volunteers. Seasoned jungle fighters, veterans of Guadalcanal, New Guinea, Bougainville. Men who responded to a call for one dangerous and hazardous operation somewhere. Organized as the 5307th Composite Unit Provisional... and placed under the command of brigadier general Frank D. Merrill. They became a part of the forces which sought to regain Burma. On January 4, 1944, the invasion was launched. Merrill's mission, to sneak behind enemy lines... surprise and destroy the main Japanese supply base in north Burma, Walawbum. Moving in three columns, spearheaded by an advance platoon, its point... they succeeded in making their way undetected through 200 miles of Japanese territory. After three months in the cruelest jungle on earth, the point was close to its goal. Bend in the trail, we better see what's around the other end. Come on Wheeler. A few miles to the rear, the main body... reached the last physical barrier to Walawbum, the Tanja Ga river. Private Driscoll, take cover. - You think that Japanese plane saw us? - Let's pray to god he didn't. Sneaking 3,000 men through this damn jungle is going to drive me nuts. Come on, let's go. - Private Driscoll. - Yes sir? Yes sir? What happened with you out there? Don't know that plane could've spotted you? I don't know what's eating me general, going through this jungle is driving me nuts. Get moving. I got 3,000 nervous wrecks on my hands Doc. 90 days and 90 nights bellying behind Japanese lines... afraid to talk, afraid to breathe, what do you expect? Left guard, this is Quarterback. Come in Left guard. Left guard to Quarterback. Come in Quarterback. You think that plane spotted any of your men? - No sir, we've good cover here from the air. - Well, what's your situation? Scouts report 300 enemy in village of Tanja Ga. Tell your patrols to steer clear of them and stay out of sight. Yes sir. Right guard, this Quarterback, come in Right guard. Right guard to Quarterback, come in quarterback. Left guard is crossing the river now. When you reach it, move fast. That plane is liable to come back any minute. What's your picture? Patrols report small enemy force moving west along river bank. Don't touch them, hold where you are until they pass. - Yes sir. - Advise point that we're moving out again. Another bend in the road, wonder what's around this one. Stock from Quarterback. Stock from Quarterback. Come in, Stock. Quarterback to Stock, knock out that gun. Quarterback to Stock, knock out that gun. See that officer? - Yeah. - He's all yours. Bullseye gets that officer. - You move in with smoke and frag. - Right. Bullseye. Stay away from my ammo. - Doskis? - Yeah? - Any of those Japanese get away? - No sir. - Muley. - Yes sir? - Where you've been? - Watching out for Eleanor. She could've got hurt. - O'Brien make it all right? - No, not with that leg. - Stock, you wouldn't leave me here? - You know we don't leave anybody O'Brien. I'll radio the column and have them pick you up. - Muley. - Yeah Stock. - Stick with him. - Yes sir. Alright, let's go. I got some extra smokes stashed away in Eleanor's pack, I'll dig them up for you. - We knocked out two guns sir. - What took you so long? I want news, have Taggy tap into that line leading to those guns? - That line is been hit. - Well, find another one. - Yes sir. - Right. Barney, have my battalion commanders come up here right away. - Hey Taggy. - Yeah? You know enough Japanese to run interference for me in a geisha house? - What geisha house? - In Tokyo when we get there. I'll teach you what I picked up on Bataan, from there on you're on your own. Hey, there's a wire. I better start climbing and pick up some gossip for the general. Hey Bullseye, what's eating you? Ah, come on, something is, what's eating you? Chowhound, I'll tell you about one last time. You stay away from my chow, you hear me? - Sir. - General. Well, now they know we're here. In a way, it's a relief. I can let my breath out. I'd suggest you hold it until we take Walawbum. You think we ought to notify the British we're not such a hot secret anymore? It might change their plans to link up with us there. I'd hate to be in the middle of Burma all by ourselves. Whether the British get there or not we got to knock out Walawbum. That's the job we volunteered for. Now Chuck, your responsibility is going to be the underground ammo dump. Yes sir. Sammy, your responsibility is the communications center. Sir, lieutenant Stockton. Go ahead Stock. Taggy intercepted one of their messages sir. Here's his translation. Americans in our rear. Where? How many? What's their strength? Identify their units. Meet me at .33. Right. Gentlemen... it's a Japanese battalion on its way to Walawbum. We got to beat them there. 20 mile march, you have your men drop their packs. Yes sir. - Hello Stock. - Hello general. How's the voice on the radio holding out? It's getting a little hoarse sir. - You lost a little weight, haven't you? - Looking skinny yourself sir. Well, I'm fatter than the last time we were here. Yeah, it's a lot better than when they ran us out of this... rat-trap two years ago, it's still rough. How you like running your own platoon? You didn't tell me when you gave me command I'd be getting gray hairs also. Hello Stock. Hello Doctor. You pick up private O'Brien sir? He going to lose his leg? Not if we can fly him back to India. Hello boys. We flying back as soon as we take Walawbum. You know if... if someone could get in behind them at Walawbum and create a diversion. That did help an awful lot. - Why don't I get going? - Yeah, why don't you? - Doctor, general look Ok to you sir? - Nobody looks Ok to me. Keep an eye on him, will you sir? That's an unusual relationship between a general and a second lieutenant. Started a long time ago when Merrill was a major and Stock was a sergeant. Someday that boy is going to be a general, he can lick one problem. Stock. - Stock. - What? Yeah? You know, when Merrill put those bars on you, he made you the big wheel in this platoon. So? So don't be sticking your neck out for us by taking the point. Let one of those other knot-heads do it. You right. Bullseye. - Yo. - Take the point. Lucky boy. Shut up. Chowhound, keep him company. Stock... This way buddy. You want me to stay behind. Squeeze that joker off while you start the fireworks? I got your work cut out at the ammo dump. Kolowicz... Put a man here to take care of that OP when we blow up the rear. Taggy, grenade that ammo truck. Bullseye, you get that OP, we attack in 33 seconds. Right guard sir. - Have you lost your watch? - No sir. Then why haven't you told me you're ready? You are ready, aren't you? - Just about sir. - Just about isn't good enough, get cracking. Yes sir. Left guard sir. - All set? - Getting my heavy stuff into position sir. What's holding you up? If we don't kick this off on time we've lost the element of surprise. Ok. Here, use mine. Stock is blown the ammo dump. - Ok, you're on your own. - We're moving in Frank. Alright, hit them hard, Put your weapon away Stock, you won't find any Japanese around here. We've licked them sir. You sure? Well, you better get out of here sir. - Nervous Stock? - Me? Hell no, let's go. You know... I like that boy, he's relaxing. - Hey, what's the matter with you? - You stay away from my girl. I recommend this guy for a section 8. Kolowicz, when we going home? I don't know, the general ain't check with me yet. - Oh, come on, level with us, when we going? - When we get replaced by the British. - What's holding them up? - The enemy, you meat-head. - Hey, Kolowicz. - Yeah? - When we going home? - Oh, is that all you guys ever think about? I've been thinking about it ever since Guadalcanal. Sarge, will you make him stop eating that slop? Turning my stomach. A little rice with some chocolate bars chopped in, what's wrong with that? Hey Eleanor, want some chow? Taggy, how many times I've to tell you? Tuck in the shirt. - Why does my shirt always bother you sarge? - You look sloppy. - Nobody said I was sloppy in Bataan. - But you ain't in Bataan. Nobody said I was sloppy when I escaped the Philippines. You ain't in the Philippines. Nobody said I was sloppy in that open boat to Australia. You ain't in an open boat either. Well, nobody minded how sloppy I looked... when I enlisted in the American army to keep on fighting, I'm a Filipino. And I'll wear my shirt out until all tyrants are dead, death to the tyrants. - You got O'Brien's? - Yeah. - Addresses? - In here. This letter is to his father. I was with him once on furlough, they were pretty close. I can't write letters. This one took me two hours. The general, he's a great letter writer. Wrote one for me once, the time I was wounded. He didn't have a home address for me, so he asked me for one. I didn't have one so I wasn't about to tell him that, So I made up one. He gave me the letter to read. Was all about me and stuff like that. I couldn't let a letter like that just go anyplace... so I told him the truth, I told him I didn't have anybody for him to write to. You can't guess what he did Kolly. He mailed that letter home to his wife along with a picture of me. You know what he said? He said sergeant... any time anybody wants to write home about you, you give them my address. I got to write these letters. - Stock, sergeant. - General. Any sign of anything coming around that bend? No sir. Alert your men that general Stilwell is expected. If he shows up, let me know. Yes sir. How many? Eight. When are those ambulance planes getting here to pick up our wounded? Plane was shot down by zeros from Myitkyina. Stock, what did he say? When we going home? You mean lieutenant. From now on around here, he's the lieutenant. You remember that, now get back to your gun. Oh boy. Why you pulling rank for me Kolowicz? You know I don't mind being called Stock, I like being close to my men. You too close to them. - What's wrong with that? - You got to be able to write those letters. - When we going home? - We're never going home. Merrill got kicked out of Burma, didn't he? And I got it right from a guy in the 1st battalion. The general won't be happy till every Japanese is bounced out of Burma. Come off it. Merrill wants to get out of this place as bad as we do. Somebody is coming. Eleanor, you just keep calm. You ain't got a thing to worry about because you old Muley is going to take care of you. Here they come boys, the British are here. We've been relieved. See? Just like I told you. Just like I told you the other day, the British are here, come on. The British are here. Muley, Taggy, come look at this. I told you Doskis. Boy, we glad to see you guys. - Hey, what's your outfit? - Queen's Crown Royal West Kent regiment. - Hey, that's a fancy name. - How about that? What is your outfit? - The 5307th composite unit. - Provisional. Oh, Quartermaster corps. Quartermaster? Do we look like supply clerks to you? We're the United States infantry and death to the redcoats. - Where you guys headed? - Myitkyina. Myitkyina? - Those poor guys. - 500 mile hike from here. Yeah and the 18th Japanese imperial division is there. Man, am I glad I'm not in that British army. Amen. General Stilwell, gentlemen. Hal, Bannister. - How are you Frank? - Fine sir. Well, you'd say that anyway. I'll come right to the point Frank. You got to take Myitkyina. I thought that was a British mission. It still is, but Myitkyina is going to need all of us. - Oh, my men have earned a breather general. - After Myitkyina. Sir, we've taken a beating. My people have got malaria, dengue, dysentery, psychological fatigue. Being behind enemy lines for three months is sapped them. You've got to beat the monsoon Frank, that means moving right away. We're not the only outfit in Burma. You're the only American infantry between New Guinea and Italy. The British have been fighting here alone three years now, we got to pull our weight. I suggest you grab their rail-head first at this spot here, Shaduzup. That'll knock out their transportation. Then cross the mountains to Myitkyina. Sir, what the general is describing is a 6 months... campaign over the worst terrain in the world. My men have just come 125 miles through all sorts of hell. To ask them to go another 500 and then fight a pitched battle when they get... there is not only unfair, it's, it's impossible. - And it's your job to do the impossible. - Not without replacements. Replacements? Every theater commander is crying for replacements. Eisenhower is got first priority in Europe. Then come MacArthur and Nimitz, I'm low man on the totem pole. Frank, you're all I got. May I remind the general, every one of my men is a 2 year combat veteran. They gave up earned furloughs so they could volunteer for one mission, Walawbum. They had one job to do and they did it. Their job is to keep the Japanese out of India. Keep them from linking up with the Germans. That's my big nightmare Frank... one million Japanese joining forces with the German army. Myitkyina is the linchpin to Burma and Burma is the road to India. It's going to be tough Frank, but it's got to be done. Oh, by the way, the newspaper boys have made up a name for your men. They're called the marauders. Come on Eleanor. Come on Eleanor, come on. Come on Eleanor. Lieutenant, lieutenant, general Merrill wants to see you sir. You're going to get the word now Stock, lieutenant. Hey, maybe they'll give us a private plane. Who cares what kind of plane as long as it's Bombay. Maybe they'll give us a big parade up Dewey boulevard in Manila, eh? San Francisco, here I come. - You sent for me sir? - Stock, what shape are your men in? - They're rich, our mule just won the race. - And you? - I didn't bet. - You know what I mean. Well, I have to admit I'm looking forward to getting back to Bombay. Those eight men you lost, it hit you hard, didn't it? They were my friends. Think you can face losing more of your friends? We're not going back to Bombay, are we? No, we're going to Shaduzup. There's a rail-head there, it has to be taken and held. They're going to be looking for us so we're going there the hard way, through the swamps. Yes sir. Your men have been out at point for a long stretch now, they got a break coming. If you want me to, I'll put another platoon out front. - You leaving me that choice? - It's right. Well, that's a tough decision to make. - Can I think it over? - We moving right out. - Why I get going? - Yeah, why don't you? Frank, don't you think you might've told him about Myitkyina? Tough enough for him to tell them what he's telling them now. Alright, take 10. - Well, how's it going Chris? - Beats milking cows back in Kansas. Better radio the column, tell them we're taking a break. - Stock to Quarterback, we're taking 10. - Ok. Battalion reports are no good. They're out of food and water. Sick list is growing, they need more rest. Yeah, who doesn't? Behind our timetable now on account of all this muck. I don't know how they're doing it, typhus, malaria. We're hurting, we're hurting Frank. You better get the column started Barney. Alright Frank. What's the matter with you? - You look funny to me general. - Funny? You're not going to pin one of these, these little tags on me. Pin it on your back when you're not looking, they'll drag you out of here. I told you, all I have is a dizzy spell, maybe a touch of fever, nothing to it. Open your shirt. Will you stop apple polishing? You already took my blood pressure. Open your shirt. You wasting my time. You like me cough? How long have you been getting away with this? - Away with what? You don't have to lie to me general, I'm your doctor. - The last physical I was top-notch. - I don't believe you. - A captain always believes a general. - How long you've been having chest pains? Was the last time you had a pain in your left arm? - Did you go in a pool of sweat? - I'm in one now, damn it. My men are liable to die in this swamp without firing a shot. Ok, Ok. I... I had one about a, about a year, three years ago... in, in Tokyo as military attache. - I was treated at a private hospital. - What was the diagnosis? I'll tell you what it was, heart... Coronary thrombosis. And you're on your way to another one. Doc, you keep this under your hat. Captain Kolodny, I'd like you to regard that as a, as an order. Hey Stock, ain't this column got any food? What you bet they're holding on us back there? Nobody is holding out on you Chowhound, we're all in the same boat. Yeah, we could use one around here. I didn't know we have enough blood left for these damn leeches. Medic, get Doskis. Hey Stock, on the level, when we getting out of here? Like I told you, when we hit the railroad tracks. Railroad tracks? Is he kidding? There ain't nothing at the end of this swamp except maybe more swamp. Relax Bullseye. - Take advantage of the break. - How you even get in this outfit Muley? They drafted Eleanor, where she goes, I go. Yeah, you're two of a kind. Boy, if my mother could see me now. - You know, there was a time... - What time is it? 7:15. - AM or PM? - AM, you knot-head. Taggy it's PM it's night, its getting dark. You're out of your head, it was night already. Now, I'm watching very carefully, it's PM. Ok, wise guy, if you're so smart, what day is it? - It's, it's Tuesday. - Everybody knows it's Sunday. - It's Tuesday. - It's Sunday. You've been hearing church bells or something? Both got battle fatigue, it's Wednesday. How do you know? You got a calender? - It's my birthday. - Let's bake a cake. No, I got a better idea. Let's have some steaks. You better knock that idea right out of your mouth Chowhound. People eat horses, don't they? What's the matter? Nobody eats mule meat until I tell you to. Get some shuteye for a few minutes, all of you. Oh, Baby, now just settle down, that's it. When I close my eyes, I see a mule is behind. Also when I open them. - What's wrong with Doskis? - Typhus. Typhus, are you sure? He's got the rash and I found a bug bite on his leg, he's running 105. - Does he know it? - He thinks it's malaria. Tag him that. Yes sir. Alright, knock it off. Knock it off, knock it off. Come on. You guys want to fight, wait till we find more Japanese. - I caught Chowhound going through my pack. - This mule Skinner is hoarding all the food. What did you do with all the K rations I tell you put that pack? I gave them to you last week, you crazy tapeworm. - Let's go. - Lieutenant Stockton... - What's holding you up? - One of my men is down. - Who is it? - Corporal Doskis. What's the matter with him? Typhus. - What you tag him? - Malaria. - Got many cases? - Got too many. Railroad tracks shouldn't be too far away now. I wonder if he made contact with anybody. Over here general, I found the railroad tracks. Barney, send for a food drop. See, just like I told you Eleanor, uncle Muley said he'd get you out of this swamp. Reach rear base loud and clear on the radio sir, the food is on the way. Alright, everybody back in the swamp and keep moving. Aren't we going to wait for the air drop sir? - No. - These men are starving. I'd rather have them hungry than dead. Parachutes will bring the enemy to this spot, we're not going to be here. - What do we do for food? - Fight for it. Right at the end of those tracks is our objective, we'll eat Japanese food. Want everybody in the swamp, get moving. All of you in the swamp, get moving. Stock, let me have that hot one. I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, let's get you over here. There. Let's have a look at this young lady. Here. Hey. Look. Hey. Watch me. See? See? Won't hurt you, here. That ought to hold it. Get you over to the doc and see if he can't get that piece of shrapnel out of there. Medic. Take care of her, will you? She's got some steel in her thigh. - I gave her some sulfa. - Sure Stock. Hey. Hey, he's not going to hurt you. There. Hey, it's going to be all right. Go on now, he's going to take care of your leg. There. Here you are Eleanor. Get some genuine Shaduzup H2O. Hey Bullseye. Girls. Yeah. Well, the landing strip is ready. The wounded are all set for evacuation. Hey, out of pipe tobacco? I guess I lost my pouch in the swamp somewhere. Signal from headquarters, Northern Combat Command. - General Stilwell is messaging you sir. - Ben, give him a hand decoding, will you? Yes sir. Have a match? - He sure doesn't waste much time, does he? - Hello Doc. - What's the score? - You want details? - No, no, just the bottom line. - The 5307th is collapsed. From a medical viewpoint, they're finished as a fighting unit. Could I have that fire again? I don't seem to be able to get this pipe going. I have never seen human beings in such condition. Drained, physically and psychologically drained. I'm not tagging them for specific ailments. I'm simply marking every man in the outfit AOE. Accumulation of everything. They're through. - I've general Stilwell's message sir. - Read it. Three Japanese divisions invading India, Imperative we take Myitkyina, can you do it? Frank, he's asking if we can do it, that lets us out. - Sergeant? - Of course, he's not ordering us to go. - He's leaving it up to you. - Yeah. Yeah, he's leaving up to me alright. Alright Doc... let's have a look at this washed-up outfit of ours... before I make up my mind whether or not we can go on to Myitkyina. Can I ask you a question general? What you looking for? Something is not in your medical book Doc. - Can I get out of line? - No. Alright, forget about the army, this is just between doctor and patient. - The answer is still no. - Alright then, I'll talk to you as a friend. If you're thinking about sending these men to Myitkyina, don't do it. You'll never be able to live with yourself. - How do you know what I'm able to live with? - I wouldn't want it on my conscience. Nobody wants you to have anything on your conscience. You've been paid to make diagnoses and I'm paid to make decisions. Hope your decision is as accurate as my diagnoses. - I'm checking your diagnoses right now. - Who's going to check your decision? Me. You're kidding yourself general, you got no decision to make. These men are at the end of their rope and so are you. When you're at the end of your rope, all you have to do is make one foot... move out in front of the other, just take the next step. It's all there is to it. Who are you? - Merrill, who are you? - Lieutenant Lemcheck make it? Did Lemcheck make it? I saw him get hit. Poor Lemcheck, poor Lemcheck. - He's dead. - Did Lemcheck make it? He's Lemcheck. Chris, headquarters needs another radio man. Taggy, you go along with him. They've got some captured Japanese documents need translating. Kolowicz, put four men on security. Bullseye, pick up eight cases of ammo for the platoon. Ammo? What's Merrill volunteering us for this time? We're low, get the ammo. I don't need any ammo, Damned, I'm not fighting anybody. - Pick up the ammo Bullseye. - Tell Merrill to pick it up himself. - What you say? - I said, tell Merrill to pick it up himself. I've taken my last order from that butcher. I'm sorry Stock. - I didn't mean it. - I didn't either. - I'll get the ammo. - I'll give him a hand lieutenant. - They're coming apart. - Yeah, yeah, we all are. Well, I hope Merrill don't take us any further than this. What's left of us. And it's been the most... difficult decision of my life. I pray... I've chosen correctly. Kiss the children for me. My love... To you, as always Frank. Well Stock? Message to general Stilwell transmitted sir. Thank you. General... I've never asked a favor of you before but I got to ask one now. I'd like your permission to tell my men when they go home. Stock, I've just radioed general Stilwell that said we're going to Myitkyina. - To Myitkyina? - Yeah. I told him that in my opinion we can take the base. - Sir, my men can't make it. - Yes, they can. - You don't know my men. - I know them better than you do. General, is not that they don't want to fight, they can't. They just can't physically fight anymore. If they've got a single ounce of strength left in them, they can fight. Men don't mean anything to you, do they? They're just two legs to walk with, shoulders to carry a pack... a pair of hands to shoot a rifle, that's all. When I pinned those bars on you I made a leader out of you. When you lead, you have to hurt people, the enemy and sometimes your own. I don't want any more of my men butchered. And I request to be relieved of the command of my platoon. Request denied, I need you too much. O'Steen... Pick that up, pick up your ammo belt and put it on. Here you go. - Go on O'Steen. - Yes sir. What's holding it up? Come on, let's move out. Come on now Eleanor, come on baby. Now come on Eleanor, you volunteered for this too. - Ok, ready to shove her over. - No, you can't do that sarge. She'll be all right after a little rest, her load is too heavy. Muley, she's holding up the whole column. Wait, I'll carry her load. Boys, give me a hand with this pack. Come on Eleanor, we climb this little old hill. Just like old uncle Muley told you, we made it Eleanor. Come on Muley, that's ok, come on. Over yonder is Myitkyina. You don't agree with what I'm doing, do you Barney? Well, the textbooks would say that dividing our forces at this point... invites piecemeal destruction. Yeah I, I wouldn't teach students this sort of thing. But if we can make the Japanese think we're twice as many of us as there are. Well, what would you do if it were your decision? I'd go through the same hell that you did making yours. How long do you figure before you can hit the base? In our condition, 24 hours. 18th Japanese division will be waiting there for us. You feel anything? - Rain. - Yeah. Yeah, only, only a few drops but it could be the beginning. We got to beat that monsoon. When this is all over, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to get married, I'm going to have about six kids. Align them against a wall and tell them what it was like here in Burma. If they don't cry, I'll beat the hell out of them. - I'll see you in Myitkyina. - So long Frank. Request general's permission to bury my man here. In there. Get on that radio, find out if Bannister is been hit. - Wonder what they're up to next. - It's only one way to find out. Pass the word, Taggy is going out. Enemy infiltration increasing along the 1st battalion right flank sir. - Who's holding that position? - Stock's platoon sir. Hey, sarge? Kolowicz, where are you? Sarge? Hey sarge. You keep your mouth shut. Don't shoot, it's Taggy coming in. - Did you learn anything? - Banzai when it gets light. - You hurt? - A little. Infiltration stopped sir. Stock is Ok sir, I just talked to radio man. You got good cover in here Eleanor. Taggy got some dope, it's a banzai at dawn. Terry, pass the word along the line. - Stock. - Yes sir. That's all. Stay awake soldier, banzai at dawn. Banzai at dawn Kolly. Banzai at dawn, banzai at dawn. Banzai at dawn, banzai at dawn. - Here. - It's your last one sir. Go on, take it, Doc says smoking is bad for me. Come in, left guard. Come in, left guard. We're pinned down by heavy machine gun fire from west of here. - Send medics, send medics. - Victor to Tom, have fallen back. I'm reorganizing and digging in. Lou hit by enemy sniper. Suggest you get down at once. All units, all units, enemy making heavy rush through center. Breakthrough, breakthrough. Left guard to Quarterback, Japanese falling back. Right guard to Quarterback, enemy pulling out. - We beat them off, they're running. - But why? Quarterback to Bannister, come in Bannister. - This is Bannister, come in Quarterback. - What is your situation? We've reached the airstrip, we're attacking, resistance is heavy. It's going to get heavier. It's the reason the Japanese are pulling out. Heading back to Myitkyina to defend the airstrip, we better get a move on. Notify battalion to assemble all able bodied men. - We're moving on Myitkyina. - We better get a move on. I want every man who can walk, every man who can carry a rifle. - You cannot order these men to fight. - Every man who can carry a rifle. Bannister needs one more push. - With these men we can take Myitkyina. - You cannot order them to fight. They'll never make it, you'll never make it. Doc, just give me something to keep me on my feet 24 hours. - That's all I ask, 24 hours. - You're asking for a miracle general. I don't have any up my sleeve and neither have you. A miracle isn't called for. Just another step, just one more step. Alright, everybody on your feet. As long as you can breathe, you can fight. Come on boy, pick up that rifle. Come on son, follow me. You can make it, all you have to do is take that next step. It's all there's to it, one foot in front of the other. Come on, let's go. You heard the general, on your feet. Kolowicz, move out. Chris, let's go. Move out. Let's go. What sort of men are these? How do they do it? How can they do it? But they did it, they did the impossible. They took Myitkyina. On that day of victory, of the 3,000 volunteers who marched into Burma... only 100 remained in action. On that same day, Merrill's marauders were demobilized... and thus ceased to exist officially. But by order of the president of the United States, a special unit... citation was awarded these men so that history would never forget them. Today their traditions are being carried on by the U.S. army special forces... and other proud units of the United States army. We salute them all.
