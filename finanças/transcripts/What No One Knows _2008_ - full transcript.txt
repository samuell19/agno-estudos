What say you? It was beautiful, Marianne. Good timing. You moved a month ago. Is it not very hasty? The aim is to keep going. Your father and I also had problems. This has been in all marriages. But we took our act together, when it was difficult. Dad was never home. Where In the very marriage was genuine? They know nothing about you. It was his work. The conditions in the Navy. We were always together. Thomas and I has not each other anymore. It is a nice evening to come home to, what '? Family Deleuran feels very good of little scratches in the paint. And it is interesting To see a mother to show some emotion. - What happened? - I do not know. It is not I who will divorce. And as much I do not drink. - You may well. - Drinking? No smile.

I just I long for the three Swedish gastronomy. - See you over there, sister. - See you. Hello. This leads to aggregation of the intelligence services PET and FE. The proposal is opposed among experts -- To call it a dangerous step against surveillance society -- - And an overshoot of citizens' legal security. The combination means that may link the security archives -- - And it would make Denmark a safer country, says Prime Minister -- - Which also points out ... Thomas? Thomas Deleuran? - Are you Charlotte's brother? - Yes. It is I who owns the gallery. She said you would come. - What is happening? - The Charlotte... She disappeared! What are you talking about? Ursula and I were in the sauna. She'd just take a little swim. Have you been out to swim? It is sgu da winter, man. Hey, hey! What happens? The Charlotte Deleuran brother. We know nothing yet. We have a helicopter and two out, both to manage. Police searches the city. She had perhaps skiftet?j with. Are you there, mother? I just thought you should know. - I am with you about an hour. - You must not come. - Why not? - I would just like to be alone. - Why they are not looking any longer? - I do not know. We can only hope for the best. Good night. Bea? Come in, sweetheart. Grandmother rang. It was something with Charlotte... Quiet, darling. We know nothing yet. I have not so good. It is not safe it has gone so wrong with Charlotte. Vel? What is it? It is simply too stupid. Do you know how addictive it is? - You confiscate my. - It was a suction. - Say it is not the mother. - "Say it is not the mother." - We must tell her where you are. - She is not home. - Where is she? - She is in town. - In the city and what? - What do you think? You also had the one girlfriend, who died, right? - It said the mother. - Move a little. It is long overdue. Were you not tired of it? Yes, of course. Their house burned, right? You are arguing with grandmother and grandfather. There is probably someone who has read the lesson, right? Yes, I... I took a trip to India. I came home because grandfather had cancer. And then I met your mother. And then we got a little m?gunge. Not? - Could you like her more than mother? - No. Mama says so? Thomas? Hello? Yes. Would I be allowed to get two minutes alone with her? The Charlotte, I knew very well, was not very old. She was an incredible piece of life and a great charmer. And I envy her, that she was never afraid of anything. Neither the neighbor's dog -- - Thunderstorms, dentists or sharp needles. When she was forgotten in one of the airtight locks on our father's submarine -- - She just laughed, when she was shut out after one hour. The picture of her I will always hide in my heart. A small, strong girl in a white dress -- - Which fell on the fool our worried faces. It was a beautiful speech. I think soon we are driving. We take grandmother with. Marianne? Should we not try again? I miss you through hell. Thomas, for the hell ... - Ursula? - Yes. Charlotte said, I had a meeting. Was it you? Do you know Charlotte well? Yes. It may sound strange, but she ever talked about our father? - Yes, a little. - What she said? - It's hard to talk about here. - Sure. Can we meet? I must know what she said. Charlotte apartment on Thursday. 12. I have a meeting at. 13. Make sure that no one follows you. You are quite visible. Yes. What is this? It is one of blood. She has certainly turned heads. - Thomas? Good to see you. - Long-Erichsen. Thomas... I am terribly sorry to hear about your sister. - I spoke with your mom last night. - Thank you. Sarah Bernhardt. All canteen boasts. - Coffee? - Yes. Well... Regarding your query on tetanospasmin or ADX 402.. I have asked our chemists. It is a biological substance struggle, I can understand. According to the network... ... it is a poison -- - Which was created by the bacterium Clostridium tetani. It is proved something to get tetanus by. One kg would be enough to to eradicate mankind. - It sounds bloody toxic. - Was my father involved in this kind? No. It is totally excluded. The Biological Weapons Convention entered into force in 75 -- - And such a disgrace was banned. The Roder we are not in Denmark. - What about when I was in Greenland? - Greenland? Yes, it is true. It was a naval exercise in the mid eighties. It was sgu otherwise toxic enough. There was drinking through. - Where are you from? - I took the Charlotte thing. And toxic substances? The word was underlined in chemistry book where the image was. It says your name and "Tyrfing". What is it? Tyrfing? It tells me nothing. - Do you know who wrote it? - Nay... It could have been anyone. Secure your father himself. - Or he who took the picture. - Yes, maybe. - Was my father away any dirt? - Yes then. He was notification officer as I do We often run into problems. That is what we are hired. Thomas, your father was very popular here. He was a fine man. Very professional. And then he was my friend. Thank you would see me. It lacked only. I am really sorry to hear it on Charlotte. I remember her still as a little girl by your father's funeral. It was the last time I saw her. Don't you meet her later? Met? No, what do you think? Nothing. I just thought... I do not know. Nothing. Thank you for today. You're late! I will back on the half hour. In return I will come alone. But I feel someone skuggar me. Charlotte was convinced that she was shadowed. I do not know so much, but she asked me to look at it here. It has something to do with your father to do. It is believed Charlotte anyway. She got it in Sweden. It is from 1984. A supply of technology and know-how. There is nothing what this is about. But there... - It's something really ugly. - How did she know? She met a woman for a preview in Stockholm. She told about your father. - About his intelligence work. - What? That I do not know. She said it is passing on the phone. - But she was clearly affected by it. - Who was her mother? I do not know her name and address. I know really nothing. But their meeting and the documents made her completely paranoid. - Was that all? - Yes, she would tell you first. - I will talk to you. - Chatting away, sister. No, not now. Not when you're stiff. Why she drowned? She could swim! She was a fantastic swimmer. - There is something mysterious about it here. - Yes... It is possible. Do you? This is my sister. We must do something. We must call the police or the press! Now you are a little too imaginative. It can be about anything. No thanks. Keep me out. I have to go. Bye. Hey. Wait. Hey! - What if I'm right? - So it is life-threatening. And it causes no Charlotte back to life. Can I contact you if I find out more? Here at Politiken we get incredibly many requests of this kind. Watch straight on. My sister had got a technical paper on the supply of poison. - Possibly a bacteriological weapons? - Yes, exactly. ADX 402 Some people die from. It is linked to security settlement. - Security Settlement? - Yes. She cut out articles... Not dolls and guitar. ...by Claus Jensen, representing you. It is very interesting but also a little vague. I think she met with FE 's Head, Lange-Erichsen. - Though he denies it. - It's probably something you can dig in. - Yes, I have liked. - I can check my sources. It is an agreement. Hello. - Long-Erichsen, father, colleague... - Yes, what about him? What made him and dad actually in Greenland? That I do not know. - You know, or not? - No. How should I know about it from? Why are you suddenly interested in this? What was father's colleague from the submarine? Ham, who always took the pictures? - Well, Hemmingsen. - Hemmingsen. Hell, yes. - Deliver him yet? - Yes, at a nursing home. Thomas, what are we talking about? There is something wrong with Charlotte's death. - What say you? That is just crazy. - Yes, it is! That is fucking covert. What the hell did Dad? You must know sgu da! You sound completely insane. I think you should shut up. - Sorry, Mom. - I just can not go. Sorry. I'm just a little stressful. I have really not what father did to Greenland. Get the barbecues out of your head. I can not stand to see you so. - Greet aunt. See you in a week. - Yes we do. Hello, darling. - Yes? - Where will you go? - Has she jumped? - She is the next. Here... You seem to get it. Beautiful. She is otherwise completely impossible at the moment. She sails around. There is surely nothing to tell. With two of us. - My two problem children. - Stop it, Marianne! There is nothing wrong with her. She is super nice. How were you when you were 14? She's just confused. What I said yesterday... I am not cringing. And I know that I have been sur and apathetic and sarcastic and... ...acid and blunt and sarcastic. It sounds like one of my songs. You must empty the entire bin in the head of mine. You're right. But... Bea? - What happened? - I was blinded. Get something cold. What? I think she met with Long-Erichsen. - Though he denies it. - It's probably something you can dig in. - Yes, I have liked. - I can check my sources. You must remember this case. Do you understand me, Thomas? You are destroying something for many. Bread you into my home? Now you're warned. Do nothing stupid. Is Long-Erichsen? Has he sent you? Did he? That was really stupid, that is, Thomas. But we are patient. We try again. Do you understand the principle now? Drop the case, Thomas! Concentrate on your children things. Have you found Charlotte to death? Next time it may be, your daughter is really the wrong place. Now you're warned. - It's orderly. Where did you go? - I could not find anything. - Can you support on it? - I think enough. Give me the towel. Hello! Give me the towel. - Have you seen a man in a brown suit? - What are you talking about? - Are you okay, Dad? - Yes, yes. I have to slip. Long-Erichsen? - I must speak with you. - About what? - Do you have a polished man of me? - What do you think? Stay away from me and my family. - I have no idea what you're talking about. - You just keep you far away! Excuse me a moment. Thomas? You've shown never learned to think before you shop. - It worried your father. - My father? There is something called respect. Your father made a fine impression here. He warned about his country. Do you? The rebel attitude I thought you were growing from long ago. Visited him in hospital? Owes his father was not it? Fuck my ass! Niels Lange-Erichsen, head of Defense Intelligence -- Get the whole command when FE on a months will be merged with PET. There is considerable political controversy on the resolution -- - But long-Erichsen, there is a competent strategist -- - With respect to the government -- - Says that one sees the merger as a huge win for the country -- - And an even larger and more secure umbrella over the individual citizen. " Combining... - Dad? - Can not take her home? Hello. It was my father. Ursula? - Thank you for coming. - What happened? He advised me to forget it with Charlotte. - Who? - Him who struck me down into the toilet. - Long-Erichsen gains control... - Relax. I have hold of something and I need your help. I have no car... Okay. But then you explain to me what the hell is happening. One of my father's old colleagues perhaps nothing. I switched bus four times to avoid them. - Are you all right? - Yes. None of Charlotte relations known to her creator. - What about the gallery? - No, there was no bid. What the hell is it I have been up to? How well do you know really my sister? How well do you think? Do I...? Did I...? We met in London, when I was seconded to the bank. I am investment manager. Charlotte took me by storm. She was fantastic. Wise, happy, fun. I had never experienced such a love before. - She often talked about you. - Was it bad? No, she called you a sweet, sm?flippet mother's boy. Do not worry. She called me for the Snow Queen. I was not aware of She was fond of the girls. It knew I did not I was. Deleuran! Thomas Deleuran. You knew his father. Mark Deleuran. I was in the Navy. Submarine Springer. Hemmingsen you sailed with his father in the Navy. Yes. Nice guy... We eat at. 18? - Like our custom, Hemmingsen. - So am I in the garden. Hemmingsen says He is an outdoor person. What is "Tyrfing"? Tetanospasmin? ADX 402 Tetanus? What about it? Biological weapons? You can not remember anything. It is as if it all disappears. You are furious. Some days he is much more clear. - How is it just. - Thank you, because we had come. Farewell, young man. Coin Laundry, Nansensgade 11 kl. 21. This way. Excuse the little idea this afternoon. They are on the toes. They checked me out the other day. - Who? - Long-Erichsen group. You mentioned the self Tyrfing. You have not done your homework. - What do you think? - Nordic mythology. Tyrfing. Viking sword that would taste blood and acting on their own. Tyrfing group. No accountability to anyone. Was Tyrfing my father and Lange-Erichsen group? And me, and several others. The remnants of my old apartment. Your father and I believed strongly in what we did for Denmark, Thomas. - He was my friend. - It said Lange-Erichsen also. We were not as he. "Amor Patria Nostra Lex". "Love for the fatherland is our law. " That was what it was about. It was not for ourselves. - Do you Tyrfing? - It is a service in the service. Group Launched some submarine men after the war. Officially it does not exist. They would create a undergrundsh?r, If the Russians attack. - I am not. - US-funded services everywhere. - We worked for the CIA. - And my father? - He was part of the inner circle. - What did you do? - We fought against all un-Danish. - Un-Danish? Now the CIA is funding is not exactly something for free. We were talented. So they used us for a little of each. In Greenland you took a picture... Thule base was a good starting point for all possible operations. Read. It is all there. Not now. I will not mix with anything. You get a weapon. That I owe your father. - But keep me out. Understood? - Yes. Here. Charlotte dug in here. She drowned. Hemmingsen, to hell! You can sgu da remember Charlotte. Since Long-Erichsen began advancement in the network, I end up. I would not mix with anything. Tyrfing was a necessary defense. But Ling-Erichsen dissolved is not because the cold war ended. He works against all our principles. He is not a man that just standing in the way, Thomas Charlotte found the death? What the hell is this! Was she murdered? Yes or no? Good night, Miss. Bloody fascist pigs! He knows something about Charlotte. If the content confirms what he says it's bloody bad. - Think that he sticks a colleague. - He is probably a little decency left. Imagine the incredible power pikhovedet Long-Erichsen sheep! Imagine that you are the boss of a bank with your language. Arts mastery you. There is me and Lange-Erichsen champions. Pig sgu have control over throughout the intelligence! I sgu indifferent. If he is behind, he Bures inside. Do you care? Have not kept up with in the last six years. We can not go to toilet without being supervised. Is anyone protesting? Politicians simply pulling on the shoulders. It is scarcely surprising with international terrorism. What have you done, Thomas? Have not listed you properly? Have you asked to be monitored and bugged? It is okay when it is immigrants and drug addicts, right? But now it is about you. You have not done shit! What have you done? - I know not. - Exactly. Let's go to my mother. CIA services... Tyrfing-boys fragtede chemical and biological weapons from Thule in 82 And here... They favored specialists available. They learned Saddam to use them against Iran. - Long-Erichsen is kemiingen?r. - And my father electrical engineering. See here. I am sure that this My father. This is also my father. Hemmingsen is only on Long-Erichsen. And it gets worse. Here is a report on the ADX 402 what tetanus shit. It was sent to Khartoum. - Yes, there are not vaccinated. - No, and that it will be just. It is totally black, the whole shit. - I contact Claus Jensen. - Let a lawyer look at it. - To have a Politiken then. - The pull down with your father. My father is dead. - Your mother may know something. - I do not think so. Yes, she can make pudding. Cyanide is used in Iran, is an extremely toxic substance. It kills within a few seconds and hundreds have fallen on the spot. - Sorry. - The survivors are very hard hit. I have some important papers. Can we meet at N?rreport in an hour? - I am on the way to a meeting. - What about kl. 12? - You will not regret it. - Okay, kl. 12. - So we have seen. - Hi. Claus? Claus Jensen? - DAV. - Thomas. - Should we find a cafe? - Can we not find something more private? Can we go home with you? The editors are stuffed. Not with me. What about at home with you? We can well. It is certainly interesting. But it is still evidence. It is obvious what happens. - The juggling is not marmalade. - No... But the FE and the government will deny any knowledge of this. It is photocopied, and such can be tampered with. And the evidence does not their responsibility in the matter. Shit, FE and the government. What is Long-Erichsen circus. Yes. But we can not prove a context -- - Between the images and documentation. And so it with your sister should have been murdered... Thomas, it does not. You have nothing. You must put pressure on them. Police must investigate this as a murder. Thomas, I am sorry. but it does not hold, if you do not have anything more.. I have a witness. - As with anything? - Everything. - Everything? - Yes. Witness gave Charlotte the information receiving her murdered. - It's good. What are we waiting for? - Promise me to pursue the story? - To tell the truth about Charlotte? - Yes, of course. Absolutely. Then it's a deal. - Is there a toilet here? - Out of time. up in the halls! They will kill me. Good morning, madam. We are looking for a man in a short black coat. Have you seen him? I believed you come with napkins. - So you have not seen any? - No, there is only me. - Marianne. - Thomas! What are you doing here? Are you full? No, I was just bad. Where is Bea?

" Congratulations, Niels. Must be allowed to congratulate? I have enough shit on you to smash you. So if you bend so much as a hair on my daughter's head... You may just have me apologized. - Sorry. - Congratulations. - Yes? - It's Ursula. - How are you? - Charlottenlund bath. - Charlotte left a bag here. - We can not talk on her phone. Okay.

So she could just snoop around. - Told you about long-Erichsen? - I have followed him long. Do you want him at the head of the country Intelligence? This is absurd. Go! Charlotte and Ursula died because of you. I figured it was over. But your spontaneous sister went to Lange-Erichsen and told everything Plaprede threatened him. I did not think they would do it again. Out. Now! I can not go without proof. They have taken my daughter. You must give me something. You gave Charlotte some documents. Two pieces of char paper and a photo. The rest disappeared in the fire. As for a fire? - Liv? - She broke in with your dad's jobs. She stole ribbon of the typewriter and copied documents.

She sleeps. - I am on the way out there. - No. I drive there. - What is it? - I am quickly left with her. Who the hell are you? What happens? You are a stubborn man, Thomas. At that point you look like your father. There is nothing happens with you. You kept your part of the agreement with Amalie, so we keep ours. We must understand each other in full. I have a small greeting from your father, Thomas. This is a video that I got from your mother many years ago. See now well after. This is a one-night stand. Dear Thomas and Charlotte. After many reflections and conversations with your mother -- - I have decided for me to play in this time. I have done many things that... I regret now. Fraternity Tyrfing that I otherwise supported firmly -- - Has run riot and has become increasingly exclusive. It went completely awry when... Liv... Your boyfriend, Thomas. We did not know that she would be in the cottage. You can not just run away from it all, Thomas. - I know it hurts... - you has never liked her. - It is not true. - Not true? What the hell do you think? - I want to help you further. - Yes, I must be here! I must get away from you. Thomas! It was absolutely terrific. It is important for your mother and me -- That I know the truth. And... ...that you can forgive me. There is no more secrets to reveal. You do not to poke it anymore. You know everything now. There is no evidence. No, you can go to or ally you. There is nothing, Thomas. I would like you tell me that you understand. - Where is my daughter? - She is fine. We have not... "curved to a hair on her head. " Democracy is not something you can just take for granted Thomas. It costs. What Mark says is true. We are ready to go even further. Tyrfing is a smooth and need little tool. We are quite many Thomas. Well... I found Charlotte murdered. You want to sleep again. Not, Thomas? I may interpret your silence as tacit acceptance? Well. Your mother is waiting for you upstairs. In the bedroom. Bea lie and sleep downstairs. She has been completely removed, so she can not remember anything. I take her home. I had no choice. They would have made life impossible. They frightened the life of me. They found Charlotte to be murdered. They would have done the same with you. I asked you to let it lie. Charlotte did not told me. I did not know what she did. You could of hell have told us the truth! I would not have been able to handle it. It was the best way. How can you live with it? How can you accept that shit? I had no choice, Thomas. We did it for your sake. Goodbye, mother. And well Liv. - Where am I? - Hi, sweetheart. Are you okay? Yes. I think enough. What happened? You were taken back to grandmother, and she has cared for you. - Can you not remember that you were there? - Not at all. I had total blackout, I think. I was at the club with Pernille. It does not matter, darling. As long as you are in one piece. I drive you home to mother. - Well, we've grandmother. - Yes... - Yes. It is good that we've grandmother. - Can I come up front? Yes. Come. There is a mother. You go straight into, right? It goes without doubt good, sweetheart.
