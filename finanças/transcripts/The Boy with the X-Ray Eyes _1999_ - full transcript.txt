(MultiCom Jingle) (dramatic music) - [Boy] Okay freshmen, you've got two minutes to run. Then we come and get ya! Go! Did you see 'em take off? They just get dumber every day. - [Boy] Yeah, genetic weakness I betcha! (laughing) - [Boy] Yeah. - [Boy] Hurry up, load 'em up! Coming to get you, Kimball! (laughing) Kimball, Kimball the thimble. (laughing) Alright, that's two minutes. You ready? - [Boy] I'm always ready. - [Boy] Let's go. You better run! (laughing) Hey it's survival of the fittest, Kimball! This is awesome! - [Boy] Come out come out wherever you are. You might as well give up you freshmen! We'll be easier on you! - Guys, can we make a deal? I got two Snickers in my backpack! - [Boy] No way, we ain't making no deals man. - Please! - [Boys] No! - [Boy] That's right Kimball, you better run! (exciting music) Don't make us madder than we already are! (laughing) (howling) - Hurry up, catch him! - Run, run! I smell fresh meat! Almost. - Lazy shot, dude. - [Boy] Come on! Hey Kimball, hey Kimball! Paging Dr. Kimball! (laughing) Ah man. Run little piggy, run! - [Boy] Can't you run any faster? (laughing) Hands up, piggy! - Okay guys, I give up. - [Boy] Gotcha Kimball. - [Boy] We got you now. (laughing) - Not bad, huh? A noble effort. - For a shrimpus maximus. - Any last words? Guess not. - [Boys] Three, two, one. - Ready, aim, fire! (paintball guns firing) (crying out) - [Kimball] Man, you messed up my clothes. (laughing) - School colors! Blue and gold! - Welcome to Washington High. - Freshmen. You guys are the same every year. - My mom's gonna kill me about this shirt. - You know Kimball, you're not such a bad guy after all. And to show you what good guys we are we'll let you shoot some pellets so you'll be ready when you're a senior. Go set these targets up, past that tree. (laughing) Moron. - Yeah. (eerie music) - Guys. Soldiers. - Yeah, I know they're soldiers. I got them at Walmart, moron. - No! I mean real soldiers! - What? - [Kimball] Hey guys, how about a ride on the back of your bike? - [Boy] You're on your own, man. - Thanks for nothing! - Run! (dramatic music) (screams) - Whoa. What are you doing? - You're coming with us. - [Kimball] No, no! - This is a disaster. - Come on guys, let me go. I've got two Snickers in my backpack. Come on. - Make sure the perimeter is secure, that's an order. This little event could severely compromise the project. - Well, at least we know it works. - Works! It was supposed to make them invisible, not send them off into some new dimension. Can we get them back? - Back? I'm more concerned about what we're gonna do with him. - Me? I didn't see a thing! Well I saw something, but it was so unbelievable that I couldn't have seen it. And by the way, did I mention that I've got two Snickers in my backpack? - Sorry kid. Chocolate makes me nauseous. - No, no! (zaps) - Alright gentlemen, let's make our other problems disappear. Move out! (booming) (exciting music) (gentle music) - Where's this one go? It's not labeled. - Andy, just set that down, I'll get it. - I don't mind. - It's fragile Andy, I'll get it. - Dad, Dad, Dad! - Whoa, whoa, whoa! You better be careful there, you little wild man. I gotta check in at work. - The pizza's on its way. - Well I'm sorry hon, you'll have to save me a few slices. Andy. Now listen, you know I appreciate your help. I just don't want you to touch any of the unlabeled boxes. Okay? - Okay. - Okay? - Fine, yeah. (roaring) Come on Cameron. You can help me destroy the upstairs. Go on, I'll meet you up there. Here, let me help you with that. - Oh, you're saving my life. How do you like the place? - I like the old place better. - I know, but your dad couldn't pass up this job. - John's not my dad. - He adores you and Cameron. You know that, don't you? - He adores Cameron. I mean I'm just another troublesome teen. - That's unfair, Andy. I understand how you must feel, but you've got to try to see things from John's point of view. (mysterious music) - We're ready for the sequencing demo, Boyd. Let's start with level one but build it up slow. - Righty-o. (beeping) - Alright, let's go to level two, reach stability. Alright. Well well. Oh Boyd. You lied about quitting smoking. And your lunch looks like something that might make a repeat appearance. - Privacy. A thing of the past. - We're destabilizing. Try level three right now, hurry. Hurry! Hurry! (beeping) Oh, we were so close! (clapping) - Bravo, John. That's the nearest we've ever come to stabilizing the image. How'd you do it? - I just replaced the old processors with self-cooling crystal chips. Just declassified by military. - How'd you get that so fast? - Friends in low places, I guess. - You've been with us less than a week and you've already accomplished more than we have in six months. Isn't that right, Boyd? - Oh yes sir, Mr. Baker. Old John's a real achiever. We make a good team. - Get me a cup of coffee would you Boyd? - I don't remember seeing coffee jockey listed in my job description. Is that a cream with two sugars? - Absolutely. John, I want to thank you for relocating so quickly. - Don't mention it, I appreciate the opportunity. And the family's adjusting okay, with one exception. - Ah, you've got a teenager. (chuckling) - And how. My stepson, his name's Andy, he's a sophomore. We pulled him out of school mid-September. He left his one best friend, four potential girlfriends. You do the math. - Not too happy a lad, I take it. - Oh Mr. Baker, you're a master of understatement. - I might be able to help. I'll call the science teacher at Washington High and arrange a field trip to the labs. Your stepson can see where you work, his chums can see how cool you are, instant popularity, end of adjustment problem. - You can arrange that? - Well it does help to be on good terms with the president of the school board. - Let me guess, you. - Modesty forbids. - Hey butthead. Hey, you don't show me much. - I got nothing to prove. - 'Cause you've got nothing! (laughing) - You got something to say? - Ha ha ha. (honks) - Andy, it's a school day tomorrow. Come on, come on home. - Now in lateral magnification for rays, the rays coming from an object point not on the object axis is called a coma. Now if a coma is present light from a point is spread around into a family. Guys guys please please. So can anyone here name other electromagnetic radiation that cannot be seen by the naked eye? Sam, can you give somebody else a chance please? - Like who? - [Teacher] Anybody? - Okay how about microwave and infrared. - That's a good start. Iris. - The other side of the spectrum. Ultraviolet radiation, x-rays, gamma rays. - Well I'm glad somebody does her homework here. (giggling) (clears throat) Mr. Carver. Can you tell us the range on the spectrum where the visible light falls? You just moved here from Chicago, right? - Yeah. - Let's imagine you could cut the country in half. Chicago would fall roughly in the... - In the middle? - So the range of visible light would fall in the... - Middle of the spectrum? - Nicely done. Light from the sun that's white light can be refracted through a prism into all wavelengths of light. - [Boy] It's the rainbow. - Kind of like the album cover of Dark Side of the Moon. The album Dark Side of the Moon? Pink Floyd? - Dude! Yeah dude! - You know guys, there was rock and roll before The Offspring, huh? (school bell rings) Wait wait wait. Listen, before you leave, make sure make sure make sure you get your permission slips signed for the field trip tomorrow, we're going to VectreComp. Okay? (gentle music) - [Girl] Hey, there's the new kid. - Hey, where's Carver's buttcrack? In the middle! (laughing) - At least I'm not a Neanderthal. - Smarter than he looks. - Mm hmm. (growling) - Hmm, who replaced my son with Godzilla? (laughing) (door shuts) (whistling) - Hi Dad. - Hi. - What were you doing in the basement? - Oh, nothing exciting I'm afraid. So, how's the new school? - Good. - Thrilling. - Any girls? (laughs) - I have to go finish unpacking my room. - Andy. Andy. (laughs) (dog barking) (soft music) (knocking) - [John] Can I come in? - Yeah. - It's gonna take a long time, Andy, getting used to the death of someone that you loved. - Used to it? - Yeah, you know. Well you hear people talk about getting over it, but I don't think that's what happens. I think you just adjust and you endure. - You know my science class is going on a field trip to VectroComp tomorrow. - Yeah I know, looking forward to it. You know what I wish? That I could have met your dad. - John. - Yeah. - I'm looking forward to it also. The field trip. - Good. Good night. - Good night. (light music) - Hey Jerry. - Oh thanks for letting us do this. So kids, come over here, we need to get your ID badges on you. Yes you too. - Here's one for you. Young lady. And you. - [Teacher] Please keep your ID badges on you at all times, okay kids? - Hi, hey. - God, security wasn't like this on the field trip to the dairy farm. - Oh well it's the alien spacecraft. We keep it in the basement. - It was a joke, Agent Mulder. - There is truth behind every joke. - [Woman] John Carver, please come to the third floor conference hall. - Uh oh. - [Woman] John Carver, please-- - Bad news? - We'll see. I'll catch up with you later, alright? Go on, get up there. (beeping) (whistling) (buzzes) (beeping) (whistling) (buzzes) Wrong. (beeping) (whistling) (beeps) - We've reached the halfway point in our tour. The public relations liaison will be right with you. Come. Come on. Please have a seat. Somebody will be right with you. - Hi Andy. - Hi. - You know, I knew you were our connection the minute I saw you. - What is he talking about? - The UFO. - Huh? - Reverse engineering of alien technology Andy, that's what we're talking about. Now that guy you were talking to? - My stepdad. - Oh good, good, good, then you guys are close. What kind of information can you get out of him? Come on Andy, don't play coy with us, we know what's going on here, we've heard the rumors. VectroComp has connections with every black ops division in this government. I mean everybody knows that they were behind the disappearance of those kids four years ago. - You know, down by Lake Cloverfield, the secret government installation? - Right. - I've been down there. All I've seen is an old abandoned power plant. Oh, you mean the secret old abandoned power plant. That's where my stepdad sells human women to the alien overlords. (laughing) (mocking laughter) - Laugh while you can, monkey boy. The power plant is just a coverup. Everything's underground. Talking about miles and miles, subterranean caverns, underground tunnels. Probably connected to this place even. Why don't you ask you stepdad about the spy? - The spy? - Oh! Yeah. Rumor has it that one of the seven new employees here at VectroComp is not exactly what he seems to be. (dramatic music) - It's fragile Andy, I'll get it. I just don't want you to touch any unlabeled boxes. (whistling) - Corporate espionage, Andy. - Are you guys up for some exploring? - Maybe you didn't see our name tags? They say limited access. - [Andy] Come on. - Hey loser, where are you going? - Hey, who cares? (mysterious music) - It's a code lock, what now? (beeping) (whistling) (beeps) - Did I mention that you rock? - You know I just, I don't know where to go from here. You're leading us in circles, Boyd. Why can't I shake the feeling that you simply don't have the slightest idea what the problem is? - I do know what the problem is, Malcolm. The crystal is unstable. - Yes, I understand, you've been telling me that for three days now. Are you with us, John? - Sorry Malcolm. (mysterious music) - I'm sorry. I shouldn't be apologizing to you, both of you. Been pushing too hard. Somebody's looking over our shoulder on this one. It's got me on edge. We need a solution. Which is why I'm putting you in charge of the project, John. It's time for a new vision. We'll go back to diagnostics, we're going to run that program again. (mysterious music) - [Sam] We're gonna get caught. - Don't worry about it, relax. - Okay what now brain boy? No way is it gonna be the same code we used to get into the corridor. (beeping) (whistling) (beeps) - Whoa. - Oh yeah, awesome. - Hey, check this out. We became outlaws for this lame Star Trek prop? - Hey, there's nothing lame about Star Trek. The original series. - There's gotta be something cool about the glasses, otherwise why all the security? - To throw people like us off the trail of what really goes on here. All we've gotta do is find the right lab. (beeping) - Dark Side of the Moon. (keyboard clicking) - What are you doing? - This should be-- - Andy, I don't think you should-- - Look come on, you're gonna get us all landed in jail, alright? - This should be a three. Three. (beeping) - Whoa. Awesome. (beeping) (whistles) (beeps) - After you. - Get away from there! What do you think you're doing? - How'd you get in here, Andy? - You know this young man? - He's my stepson. - Well you better have a good lawyer because I am calling security. - Hold it, hold it. Hold on. You're not calling anyone, Boyd. - But-- - John. Take a look. - Malcolm, it works. - Yes. - What did you do? - Well I, there was a slight error in the math. An eight instead of a three. It must have been a typo. - Like this kid can correct my math. - I'm afraid he has. Would you like to take a look? Alright. - Oh here, Andy, use the remote. Now push right here, controls the level of the x-ray. - [Andy] Whoa. Cool. Oh yeah. Man. - Hey, whoa there super boy! - Alright, alright. There. Like 'em? - Are you kidding? - Boyd, I want these locked in the vault. No one signs them out without my permission, understood? - Yes sir. - Let's take the afternoon off to celebrate. Then we'll get to work refining the controls, especially the cloaking system. Young man, while I certainly don't approve of the way you went about it, you've made a major breakthrough for us and I thank you. Now I'm afraid it's time you got your butts out of my top security laboratory. (mysterious music) - I forgot my backpack. - [Boyd] Forget something? - Thanks. - Let me guess, they caused some kind of trouble. - Oh no no, far from it. - Sam. - Come here. Andy, you know I find myself strangely torn. You broke into a top secret facility. Last time I checked, that fell in the category of bad. Oh man. But I am proud of you. See you tonight. - Okay, moms go rest, nine year olds get ready for bed. - Go. - Scientists and spies do the dishes. Come on. - Well. Guess we'd better get to it, especially with all the unpacking we've got to do. Oh. (dog barking) (sighs) So I'll wash, you dry, okay? - Okay, okay. John? - Yeah? - Why do you always keep the basement locked? - Well I got some equipment down there. You know those boxes I asked you not to mess with. - What kind of a equipment? - I'll show you when I get it all unpacked, alright? Hey, grab those dishes over there, would you? - Honey, I'm home. (gentle music) Hello dear. - I didn't hear you come in. - I've got some news. The glasses. They work. It's only a matter of time before we refine them so that they work across the entire spectrum. And then I'm going to take you outside and show you the world. What do you think about that? (laughing) - [Wife] Wonderful. (dramatic music) - Why don't you just cut a path with a chainsaw, might make less noise? - Lieutenant Biddle. - Give me some good news. Alright, let's change our tactic then. Give me any news. - Glasses work and I managed to smuggle them out of the lab. - And the cloaking device? - Let's just say that it's not 100%. - Let's have them. - You see that's where we get into this whole gray area between good news and just news. (sighs) - I am beginning to think that you were put on this earth expressly to punish me! Take a stab at the gray area, Mr. Russell. - A kid has them. - A kid? - It's not just a kid, it's the son, well, it's the stepson of the new scientist at VectroComp. See I used him as a mule to smuggle the glasses out of the lab but he's also the reason that the cloaking device hasn't been perfected. I deliberately screwed up the math that controls the shield of the prism inside the glasses to buy more time to work on the cloak and then this punk kid comes in and corrects my math. Oh I'm glad you're amused by this. - Oh far from it, Mr. Russell. You know very well the success of our mission depends on that cloaking device. I could care less about the x-ray vision, the military applications are minimal. But invisibility, now there's an offensive weapon. And since you failed so miserably to develop the technology on your own, I risk personal discovery to set you up at VectroComp so you could simply steal what we need! And you failed at that too! - Not yet. - Use what has been given you, Mr. Russell. The boy, his stepfather, and bring me those glasses. (ominous music) - Back soon Mom, going to the park. - [Grode] Yo Ritchie, check out who's coming. (rock music) (laughs) - Well well well, if it ain't Robbie Knievel, huh. - Hey Moe, hey Curly. - That's funny, we're the two stooges. You gonna put on another daredevil thrill show for us? Impress the girls? - Why not? - Think you can jump the bear? - Oh come on, even you could jump the bear. - You're just a laugh riot, aren't you? - Grode, make a ramp. - Okay. - [Richie] Come on, you chicken. (mimicking chicken) (laughing) - Hey, don't worry, there's a payphone down the street and we'll call you an ambulance. (mimicking chicken) (shouting) (laughing) - Oh man! - Woo, come on let's go to the Crunchy Freeze. Grode's buying. - Oh, you bet. Come on, let's go. - [Richie] Shotgun! - Oh no. This is not good. (dramatic music) Wow. Whoa. - This oughta be like taking candy from a baby. - Oh man. - You know what? I think I'm beginning to get a clear picture of what this alien abduction stuff is all about. The Kennedy assassination. - Wait a minute. - Oh no no no no. Extraterrestrials, the grays, were in league with Kennedy's rivals in the government, not to mention, you know, the mafia. I've been over and over this, it's finally obvious to me that Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby were both abductees. Ruby killed Oswald to prevent him from revealing the alien implant in his brain. The same implant that transmitted the extraterrestrial, you know, signal ordering Oswald to kill President Kennedy. - [Andy] Guys! - Oh thank god. Finally. - Some frequency, Kenneth. - You guys aren't gonna believe this. - You stole the glasses? He stole the glasses. - Andy! - Boyd, Boyd, Boyd-- - He stole the glasses! - Boyd, in my backpack. I need to talk to you guys, just-- - Oh no no no oh no. I'm not going to jail for you, Andy. - Come here, come on. - Alright. - Look, Boyd, he must have slipped the glasses in my backpack and I think that my stepdad's involved too. - That's crazy! - I know, but something's going on. (ominous music) There's some shady action going on in the basement. He keeps it locked and acted very suspicious when I asked him about it. - Has he ever been abducted by aliens? Okay, alright fine. Let's take the investigative approach. What would your dad and this guy Boyd want with some goofy looking glasses? - I dunno, they want to join Devo. - Would you stop making jokes Andy? This is serious! - Better listen to him, Andy. This is very serious. Just give me the glasses, Andy. I'll see to it the authorities never find out what your stepfather has done. Come on Andy. Just give me the glasses. Andy. Andy. Gimme the glasses! - [Iris] Run, run! - [Sam] I got him, I got him, I got him. (dramatic music) - Alright kid, you made your decision. I hope you like not having a father. - Wait wait wait wait. What's going on? Uh oh, this is not good. - Why don't you put the glasses on and find out what's going on inside? (snaps) - I see about five or six figures. I think that's my mom. - Andy? - What? (buzzing) - The glasses. They're, uh, they're gone. - Then why am I counting your ribs? - No, I'm telling you, they're completely invisible. - Hey, I can't get 'em loose. Oh no! This is not good. They're taking John away. This is not good. What are we gonna do? - I dunno. - Guys guys guys guys! Hey guys, I was afraid that Boyd had caught you guys! - They arrested John. - What? - Yeah, and the glasses, they're invisible. - And I can't get 'em off my face. - No. - Oh great. What else could possibly go wrong? - Look, just give me the remote and maybe we can power them down and I can reverse the process. - Yeah. - Uh oh. - What do you mean uh oh! Sam! Jeez! - I must have lost it. - Let's go let's go. - God! - Okay look, whatever's causing this invisibility must be creating some kind of magnetic field. - Are you saying that my head is magnetic? - Okay who am I, Spock? I don't know how these things work! (groaning) - I can see in the basement. - What is it? - It's real hard to make out. I'm kinda seeing through it too. It looks like lab equipment maybe. We're gonna have to break in. We gotta see what John's been up to. - So that's where you went. I'm always losing the remote. - Perhaps I should pursue a career in criminal arts. - Guys? - Alright, you tell me, what is all this stuff? (mysterious music) - Whoa. - It's your birthday present. Your dad was gonna build you a science lab. - I didn't do it, Malcolm. You have to know that. - Do I? I've known you about a week, John. Our people are put through the most intense security measures possible, but maybe, maybe you slipped past us. I'm afraid I don't know what kind of a man you are. What I do know is that your stepson, a 15 year old boy, somehow managed to break into a high securance laboratory, a lab that you know the entrance code to. And while in that lab, he was able to solve a problem that's been plaguing this project for months. And now that project has been stolen. I didn't design those x-ray glasses because I wanted to change the world, John, or to give the military some swell new weapon. My wife has been blind since she was a little girl. My hope is that the technology can be improved to the point that she'll be able to see again. - I can't believe I lost the remote. I'm such a loser. - I'm not just a loser, I'm a big suck loser. - You know if there were a royal family of losers we would be the inbred mutants forced to live in the basement. - Yeah and eat rats. - Mm hmm. - Man cry me a river. Look. We can either sit here and whine or do something about it. - Mm, whine. - It's almost time for Buffy. (buzzing) (shouts) - Hey! - What is it? - The effect, it's getting weaker. Your flesh and muscles are coming back. - Hey, don't go exploring, Columbus. (buzzes) (shouts) - The effect, it's getting stronger now! It's freaking me out! - I think someone's using the remote. - Maybe the person who's using it is still in the park. - Alright look, sit down in here, just stay here okay, we'll be back in a few minutes. Alright, let's go. - I can see through my eyelids! (suspenseful music) - Come on, this way. - I can see through my eyelids. Stop this! Oh. (groaning and shouting) - [Sam] Where is it? - Man am I an idiot. The solution has been right in front of me the whole time! All I've gotta do is go see Malcolm and tell him what happened. (mysterious music) Wow. (doorbell rings) - Hello, is someone there? Yes? - Um, hi, is Malcolm in? - No I'm sorry, he's not. He had some business to take care of. - Could you tell him that Andy Carver came by please? - Of course. - Tell him that I have something that belongs to him. - Is there anything else? - No, thank you. - [Wife] Okay then, good night. - Did you find it? - No. Alright look, if you were a remote, where would you be? - Definitely not in this forest. - I can't believe this. Just forget it, okay, just forget it. I'm a loser, alright? - And the fact that you lost the remote? Yeah. Otherwise, you're a perfectly acceptable guy. So knock off that loser stuff. I mean, don't get me wrong, I still think you're certifiably insane. (dramatic music) Duck! Duck duck duck! Boyd. What does he want now? - Maybe he's got the remote. Okay, let's go. - I have some good news and I have some, well I don't know what the good news is, but I have it. Lieutenant Biddle, how are you? - Let's cut the niceties. News, good, bad, whatever. - I set up the stepfather. He's sitting in a jail cell right now and that should buy us some time. - You were actually doing pretty well until you said that. You don't have the glasses. - The kid still has them. You want some good news? The cloaking device works. The bad news is we haven't been able to make it work right which means the glasses are bonded to the kid's face unless of course we can wire him to a computer and shut 'em down using the failsafe codes. - And that's why you haven't brought the glasses to me yet? You're still not thinking these things through, are you? - What do you want from me? The glasses are stuck to the kid's head. - Then bring me the kid's head. - We better go get Andy. Look, he made that easy. - [Sam] Oh my god, what's he doing here? He's supposed to stay at home. - [Iris] I dunno. - Andy! - I'm at one with the universe! - Wow, he's totally freaking out. - Andy, Andy, Andy are you alright, you okay? - I can see the eye of god. - Andy, that's the Texaco sign. - Okay, alright Andy, Andy, come on, it's time to snap out of it, okay? Pull yourself together, come on! - These glasses are freaking me out! Hey, are you slapping me? - Look, Boyd is gonna do a lot worse than slap you if we don't get those glasses off your face. - No but you heard him, we can't do that unless we hook him up to the computer again. - [Iris] What about the lab? - Oh, okay, yeah great, great, let's just break into VectroComp again, that's a good one. - No no no, the lab in Andy's basement. Why don't we just make a new remote? - Wait, we can do that? - I don't see why not. Come on, let's go! - Hey guys, guys, help me, help me. (mysterious music) On the shelf. - Come on baby, where are you? Ah, gotcha. Universal TV remote. We'll see about that. - Huh. (machines whirring) - Alright, screwdriver. - Check. - [Sam] Soldering iron. - Check. - Various electronic gizmos. - Check? - Brow. Brow. - Check. - Ah. Right tools for the right job. - Right tools for the right job. - You know it actually looks like a model car I built in the fifth grade and subsequently blew up with an M80. - This is never gonna work. - Could you be a little bit more optimistic please? - Shh. Did you guys hear something? - I can't see anything. - Alright, let's start with turning off the cloaking device. Yeah? (buzzing) (crying out) Okay okay okay okay okay. So what I meant to say was I'll decrease the level of the x-ray effect. - It's working. It's working! It's working! - Shh, shh! (suspenseful music) Okay, maybe I'm just nuts, but I think there's something creepy going on upstairs. - What do you mean, like parents making out creepy or like serial killers on the loose creepy? - There's definitely something up there. It could be a cat but the glasses are really out of control. - That's no problem. (bleeps) Captain, please turn the phasers on stun. (bleeps) - Come on. (buzzes) (cries out) - [Andy] What'd you do? - Same thing I did last time, didn't it work? - [Andy] You zapped me. - Shh! Shh! Am I the only one who is a little bit concerned about the cat or whatever it is upstairs? - You're not really afraid of a cat, are you? - He said it might be a cat. Operative word might. - There's definitely something up in the carport. If it is a cat, it's really big. - Like how big? - Who cares? Look, we know that the remote control works so I say we play with it later. Come on, out the window, better safe than sorry I always say. - I've never heard you say that before. Here here here, let me dial it down some more. (buzzes) - Ow, you shocked me! - Wait wait wait. Okay, let's go over what we're gonna do. So what's the plan? - We take the fight to them. - Oh, and the insane guy says take the fight to them. And everybody laughed and laughed. - We've got to go out to the old power plant. I mean with the x-ray glasses I can find the secret entrance to the base. Maybe then we can find the information we need to shut these guys down and clear John's name. - Hey! Wanna make this interesting, huh? Okay I'll play. I'll play. - Richie, we're not supposed to be here, it's government property. - Nobody tells me where to go. - Guys guys guys. I can't do it. - What? - I can't, I can't go on. - [Andy] Why not? - Do you even know what's out there? I'm telling you, more than the truth is out there. Okay scary stuff is out there, alright? - Look, Sam, we've been friends a long time, right? - Yeah. - Wasn't it me who comforted you when you found out your sea monkeys couldn't drive Cadillacs? - Yes. - And wasn't it me who calmed you down right after you found out that your ant farm would never grow crops? - Yes. - And wasn't it me who saved you from extreme embarrassment by pointing out that the middle kid in Hanson is a boy not a girl and that maybe it wasn't a good idea to send him a mushy fan letter? The main thing is that I'm your friend Sam, and I'm not going to let anything happen to you that wouldn't happen to us. Right Andy? - Couldn't have said it better myself. - Alright, okay, point taken. Alright, you're right. Let's go. (owl hooting) - Hold it, hold it. Got two bogeys. - That just sounds gross. - 10 o'clock, behind the oak tree. Two males, teenagers, maybe, I think it's Richie and Grode. - That's just fabulous. You think they been following us? - Initiate plan B. - Right. - Plan B? What the heck is plan B? Okay that's for leaving me out of that one guys, that's great. (shouting) (laughing) - Nice boxer shorts, Richie. Mama's little stinker? - It's laundry day. Hey, how did you know what I was wearing? - My god. - You freak, I'm gonna pummel you. - You know you're trespassing here. This is government property. We can have you arrested. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Why don't you go do that then. Why don't you tell the president of the school board for all I care? That'll get us in big trouble. - We'll see. Come on Grode. - Hey, was he really wearing mama's little stinker underpants with the cartoon skunk? - Yeah. - Oh man. I used to have a pair of those in second grade. You know, novelty item to amuse the parents. I used to put them on my head and used to dance around-- - Too much information, Sam. - Whatever. - Let's go. - [Man] Trespassers in area 102. No no boys, you did the right thing calling me. - [Richie] That'll teach those idiots. (laughing) - Guys guys. This is it. This is where those kids disappeared four years ago. - This is area 102. - Area 102? - Twice as scary as Area 51. - I better scan for surveillance equipment. Power me up to level two. - Level two? - Yeah, it just sounds cool. - [Andy] I got some good news and I got some bad news. - Bad news. - There are tons of laser beams crisscrossing the ground. - Good news? - I don't know, I was just trying to cushion the bad news. Iris, put your arm around me. - Hey look, I like you and all, but I'm not that-- - Alright, just move when I move. Three two one. Okay, okay, this way, this way. (suspenseful music) Again, on three. Two, one, and jump. Okay straight, okay three, two, one, jump. - Hey hey hey. That's the power plant over there. That means there must be an entrance around here somewhere. You know they have all these for emergency evacuations. - How do you know that? - Standard covert military procedure, read it on any website. Okay look around at the trees for any hairline fractures or unusual root patterns. - Hey, I see something. Look. Three two one and jump. Alright, alright. Foot over and jump. We're clear. - Oh that's cute. So the masterminds behind this whole thing are the Keebler elves? - There's a chance we could have just triggered some kind of warning mechanism. - How good a chance? - I'd say at least 50/50. - Sir, I'm showing activity in quadrant six, probably a glitch on the system. - There's no such thing as a glitch. Cross check everything, always. (suspenseful music) - [Iris] This is amazing. Our tax dollars at work. - You don't even have a job. - Okay, my dad's taxes then. This is a transcendent moment. All my paranoias proven, justified. My life has meaning and a purpose. - Sam, save it for a tell-all book and Springer. - Springer? Are you kidding? 60 Minutes or nothing. - Guys, can we get back to the matter at hand here? We have to find the nerve center. Take the fight to them, remember? - Hey, footprints. - They're not military tracks. - The humidity and low level lights are really affecting these glasses. It's hard to make out anything. - Do you see any laser traps? - No. - Would you guys keep it down? This place is probably wired for sound. (suspenseful music) - Hey, here's a door with no handle. - Looks like a combo lock lateral slide. Standard issue. It's a pretty tricky tumbler. Yeah. Oh yeah. - We're in. - [Iris] Whoa. - Sweet. (dramatic music) This is all from the corps of engineers. - Hey, these are the blueprints to this power plant. And the overlay for this underground construction. - The whole power plant was just a cover up for these underground networks. Divert the public's attention, the old magician's trick. - And to think the government would deceive the public. - Hey guys, look at this. - Oh man, oh man. Do you know what these things are? God, I can't believe I didn't bring my camera. This is in my book for sure. - What's so special about 'em? - I mean all the pieces fit, this just proves everything. Don't you see? These are the bikes that those kids who disappeared on were riding. Stu Bryant, Delden Swanson, Kimball Pike. Two were on bikes, one was on foot. Look, they were playing paint wars. Paintball guns. Must have kept them here as evidence. As cover up. - Uh, do you have any other questions you want answered? - Yeah, like where are they. (alarm blaring) - Well you can ask the three soldiers coming down the tunnel. As for me, I'm outta here. Iris? - [Iris] I'm so gone. - Look, get on the bike. - I never learned to ride. - What? - Oh what you didn't get that? Great, then it gives me a second chance to humiliate myself by telling you I never knew how to ride a bike. - Well get on the pegs. - No no no, I'll just slow you down. Look, look. You guys go this way and I'll go this way. Divert their attention. We'll meet up where we came back in. - You do realize the one that goes alone always gets caught? - It's just a cliche. - Remember, we're a team, always. - Right. (dramatic music) - Move it, move it, move it! Down corridor three, now, now! - Well well, fancy meeting you here. - I can explain. - Oh, I guarantee you will explain. When I'm through with you, you will explain why you chose the breakfast you ate on the last Tuesday of 1993. Was it an omelet? Maybe Pop Tarts. - Sorry guys. - Guess cliches are cliches for a reason. - Look, I'm the one you want. Let Sam and Iris go and I'll do whatever you say. - Touching. You know I'll just chalk that up to the stupidity of youth. From what I can see, I'm holding all the aces. You, you're just a joker in the deck. Card analogies. They are so vivid. Move out! - Ow! - Move it kid. Let's go you two, keep up with us. Hey, guess what. You got a date with my boss. Have a seat. - You may be wondering why you're still alive, or at least not blindfolded. The fact is I'm just so gosh darn proud of my work here I simply had to show off. Especially to an interested, albeit captive, audience. (chuckles) - I'll take supervillains for 400 please, Alex. - You may be interested in knowing the origin of what you're seeing here, all this precision labor, sweat, glory, excellence. It's all a byproduct. Technological byproduct. Ah. (snaps) Okay, here's an analogy that you children may be able to relate to. Just like the chicken nugget. The chicken nugget was actually the excess of a failed chicken sandwich, but some forward thinking executive recognized that he could sell that byproduct. And of course, naturally, inevitably, it became more popular than the original! Which is precisely what's happening here. We were siphoning technology from VectroComp. - Through a carefully placed operative in the company. Little old me. - And the byproduct of the x-ray device was the possibility of a cloaking device. Rearrange molecular structure to create invisibility. - I know someone I'd like to make disappear. - We were getting information from VectroComp at a good rate but not (snapping) fast enough. Funding from our sources had dried up due to a rather unfortunate, really quite tragic situation. The end of the Cold War. Our project was at risk so I planted Boyd here to help with the development of the x-ray device so that we could catch up here and we did. Until the unexpected popped up to make things really interesting, you. You were the X factor that we could not predict. The mathematic variable. Let's take care of the glasses. - We should have visual confirmation of the glasses very soon. Power up the cloaking turbine! (dramatic music) (buzzing) - What about the three kids, what happened to them? - Oh they're here, just not in this dimension. Their molecular information is stored in this device. So they do exist. - What are you gonna do to us? - I think that those three children need some company. After all it has been four long years for crying out loud. (alarms blaring) Your friend Mr. Carver has provided the final piece of the puzzle. The energy from the crystal of those glasses has been absorbed into the mainframe. A very new age concept. (humming) You know what I see? I see a scared little boy who is not long for the third dimension. Boyd! - Yes sir. - Prepare for dimensional cloaking. (dramatic music) - But sir, I-- - There is no I in team. Everything, everything for the greater good of the project. - But I-- - Just do it! (snaps) (alarm blaring) I'll make your photos on the milk cartons look suitably flattering. Goodbye, children. - [Soldier] This way, kids. (zapping) - I've got two Snickers in my backpack. - [Biddle] What the? - Andy the plate, push Biddle onto the plate! - I got your back. (zapping) (screaming) It's alright, the police are surrounding the place outside. They won't get far. - But how did you? - You know I have had blueprints and specs on a machine like this for months. I never had the resources though. It's a bipolar device. It's an amazing machine. - I mean well you just about earned your own chapter in my book, you know, not to mention part of the royalties. - Yeah Mr. Baker, impeccable timing I must say. - Well you can thank your hoodlum friends for that. They called me and convinced me that they were telling the truth. Now I'm afraid I have a lot of apologizing to do to Andy's stepfather. - My dad. I mean you can call him my dad. Boyd, where do you think you're headed? - Malcolm? Malcolm! (chuckling) I am so glad that you came when you did. You have no idea what it is like to be forced, forced to do something against your will. Now, now I know what Patty Hearst felt like. There were guns-- - Can it, Boyd. I heard, saw, and recorded more than enough. You've been tripped up, or in parlance you'll understand, you got jail. (laughing) - [Andy] Come on, the food in the slammer couldn't have been that bad, could it? - I'll miss those jailhouse cabbage rolls. (laughing) Mm. It's good to be home. - It's good to have you home, John. You've got a heck of a son there, you know. - And I have got a great pitch for a TV series. World's wildest conspiracies. Gonna blow that bogus alien autopsy thing out of the water. - Andy, I can't thank you enough. You know, what you saw when you visited Nancy it was a nodule pressing against her optic nerve. All the conventional x-rays she's had missed it. So we're going to the Mayo Clinic on Friday and we don't know exactly what the results will be but we've got a lot of hope. - I see enough to know you're a special boy. - Uh, could you excuse me for a minute? - Sure. - So back to school tomorrow. Seems kinda dull now huh? - Not for me. - I mean, you'll probably be too busy with schoolwork and other stuff to hang out much, huh? - Busy, yes, stupid, no. We still got that date coming, right? - You know it. - Besides, I only have x-ray eyes for you. - That was pretty bad. - I can see clearly now? You're a sight for sore eyes. How about-- (swelling music) (dramatic music) (MultiCom Jingle)
