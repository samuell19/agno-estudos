Morris something that's been puzzling me what's that how could you just go and leave him when it happened how could you manage to do things now I'll ask you something don't you think you owe me an answer first of all the things I might have done do you really think leaving him was the easiest all I want to know he had a heart attack exactly what happened he was in a lot of pain I called down they sent an ambulance you call for an ambulance yourself or they were tildes I asked for a doctor they said an ambulance was better they sent an ambulance what did you do mean one I was with Richard what did I do I was with him it was conscious barry of you he was afraid you'd have to be told you'd find out that's why it doesn't matter now it matters to me one day a might find out just how much they'll hope you don't here we are happy they wear miss Davis codeine have another pork I want to apologize fry what did I do now how do I give you a look thanks but this is where I live do you want to come in I'm upstairs often follow people I have him - come on what do you want I told you to apologize I'm beginning to understand why he was so afraid for instance I'm afraid I never saw a man in pain like that well he was afraid of with you finding out he begged me to leave that's why I went he begged me what to show you something how did you get back to London hitched why if you drove the car to the hospital I had this this idea that perhaps it was nothing I'm true gran indigestion I thought I might be able to take him home back to the hotel of course once I got to the hospital then I was told didn't think that the car back could drive I drove it there I felt my test three times no license no insurance he must have known something was going on wife's generally doesn't yes I don't suppose it was exactly the first time was it this is my house this is where we lived this was our place have a good look at it now this is where we spend our lives 14 years of it anyway Richard and I together look at it will you very nice they loved each other don't you dare try and destroy that hatred lies it hurts him to tell them he was always saying so oh I expect you're quite used to them when did I tell lies you hate me don't you I did what I could I really did I loved him so there we are okay thank you so much really you know you don't have to pretend I've done anything anyone else couldn't have done I quite realize it isn't exactly stretching your talents but it's nevertheless a big help promise you even if you can only give us a couple of days a week we'll see okay i am i gather you saw mag she seems in very good spirits well we're trying to be civilized about it these things happen after all nobody deliberately sets out to hurt anybody do they mr. president yeah okay could we possibly have dinner sometime and they really chew the fat you know what I mean have a proper talk men dream about being bachelors again but believe me there's no lot of guilt on that particular gingerbread and how about tomorrow or Friday Friday Friday I'm to sail pretty one my mother-in-law but I think I'll bill away because I did I'd really like that it's about your job job the one you were doing before and Morrison Whitman well he hasn't he I'm sure you enjoyed it more than the one you're doing now as a job I mean much what a nice shape yeah especially if you happen to be triangular it could really lose you I spoke to Peter about it I'm sure he'd be alone I couldn't possibly go back with you oh but Hall is called he asked particularly about you he hoped you were still about called you by a funny name Georgia you obviously made an impression sure it's like um sure seems such a pity to waste yourself it's up to you forgive me for asking how did you make this tea why isn't it any good oh my goodness the tea forgot to put the tea in the teeth did seem quite weak I'm Nana it's not that I don't myself I was gonna have coffee have you had any Soviet I made something for both of us how about an omelet I make good omelets everybody does I'll try and remember to put the eggs in I'd like how long has it been going off what Oh depends on what you mean by it they ever come here once or twice maybe three times why never happened before not in 20 years I'll make some coffee I'm trying to better than I did with the tea don't you did he call you that among other people yes it will my father started it do you come from land Bristol I've never been to wisdom we did go to the cheddar gorge once on a holiday we live in the caravan didn't you he told you that did it you came up you like camping it's quite fun except that they had a very good time except that you can't screw very easily in a caravan right not with all of you but with four of us anyway I could've had a rosier I suppose you weren't quite that down to earth I'm afraid I'm probably very school here I wanted to kill you I can't say I blame you honestly only I never meant to be a threat you know to human him he and I it was just it's one of those things oh I'm sure it happens all the time it just doesn't happen to me all the time not that I knew I don't think I know anything about me I don't know that I want don't despise him I loved that's always a mistake don't you think now I think it's lovely despising people's a bit too easy don't you think I despise myself most of all I do that when you've cut me told you do you seriously believe that you made anything to reach it he was a middle-aged man and you were simply younger yes when you word are you like I'm nobody I mean you read a lot I used to read a lot once the book the little shit is that one of your favorites especially it was let me buy someone here in the house dick picked it up and still you mind he took it you liked it I think sometimes I hate you shouldn't did you ever try to describe somebody without looking at them whatever the photograph just out of your own mind your memory I keep trying I sit and I think if I only describe them fully enough I'll be able to bring him back again really you can't describe anything isn't that the truth almost become my dilemma please don't what he stunned us hmm both of us stayin hate me stay and do anything all right do you have someone else someone else I wanted to kill you I wanted to kill you so much it it saw me through the whole horrible thing the funeral I don't know what I've done without him I was almost glad you existed don't worry he loved you after all I ought to know you don't know anything yes I do lie about it me and Richard if I don't who does Oh oh man don't you feel sorry for them did he make you happy you know yes and I did him I feel sorry for them because when they make a woman happy they are necessarily happy themselves it cuts them off never talk to you about it to do marriage makes you careful things might be remembered with me it wasn't worried I'm not sure if you've been kind with your being very cool do you still want to kill me you don't know D because then I wouldn't be around a hate would I I wouldn't be around to keep him alive that's what we want from each other cared isn't it to keep him alive a little longer you and me after all what would we be on our own you know which it's things you make me feel alive the only thing that does don't I you know you're such a liar please don't keep saying that it keeps being true I think I better go before people what being kind being cruel was a difference go home what will you do you'll think about him you think about me please stay I like looking at you don't rely looking at me that's the moment I love don't you to map but in the words run out when the word and you know what's kind of [Music] the killer I still eat [Music] don't you Joe Joe Joe chills I'm school Hey it

soon after what happened but there it is it happened I would have had it happen for the world and if it hadn't happened I would've stood the chance in hell I know all that on the other hand she's probably the most sickening humbug I sort of believed that if you and I were to hit it off rich would sort of be a part of it do you know what I mean yeah I suppose I should have waited and I feel as
