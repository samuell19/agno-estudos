Heinously hot. I'm melting, Mare. Stuff's got to breathe. JFK to London, London to Johannesburg, Johannesburg to Polokwane, and Polokwane to the middle of freaking nowhere. Where are we right now? The bush. Do they have one of those fans that, you know, like, squirt water? - Hello, Tata. - Hello. Hey. Hey. Norah, you want some water? Take some water. Dad, are you sure he's coming? Well, I hope so, 'cause an Uber would take a long time to get here. Whew! - It's so hot. I need water. - How about it, Mare? Come on. Africa? - Oh, my God. It's so hot. - Come on, baby. Talk to me.

The last time I saw you, you were just a... - ...little half a man. - Okay. - You are getting so much taller. - Okay. - Wow. You're getting so much more witty. - All grown-up. And, Meredith, how's the teenage life? It's just "Mare." - Mare. Okay. - Here you go, brother. Here we go. Wow. Okay. Yeah, let's give you guys a hand here. - Let's go. - All right. Welcome to Mopane, guys. Are you, like, one of those game wardens? I've had to sort of become, uh, like an enforcer for the reserve. Enforcer? Yeah. Safari's big business. A lot of pressure on all sides. One way or another, everyone depends on the animals for their survival. Oh, this is Mom's village. Yeah. I first met your mom when I was a kid. Used to come up here on family holidays. Met her and her friends. They taught me all about the area. Actually, uh, got me interested in wildlife. And after university, I introduced her to your dad. ♪ Indalo ilimeele ♪ ♪ Indalo ilimeele ♪ ♪ Ilimeele... ♪ Whew! I got some memories here, boy. - There you go. - Whew! Whew! - Looks all good, man. - Yep, yep. Yeah. It's the nicest it's looked in a long time, 'cause I knew - I had guests coming. - Oh, sorry. - It's okay. - You did? Yeah. - Okay. - Come on. This way. Wow, man. You really looked after the place. Is that the, uh, Bantam? - Yep. Yep. - No. You still didn't fix it? No, I was waiting for you to come back - and see if you could get it running. - Me? Yeah, right. - It goes straight up. - Okay. Just through that one on the left, guys. - Wow. - Yeah. Hey, man, uh, thank you so much for having us. - Yeah, of course, man. - We really needed it. - Anytime, bro. Anytime. - Is it this door? Right through that door. Yeah. - You need help? - Just kick it. Sometimes it sticks. Yeah. Put strength into your foot, Norah. - Come on, big foot. You got it. - Okay, wow. That's... There we go. Get some light. Oh, guys, don't worry about your shoes, please. Since my last girlfriend left, I've been living like a bachelor. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, place is a real mess. You'll have to excuse it. - So, um, Uncle Martin. - Yeah? What's your Wi-Fi password? Just so I can, you know, like, connect to it or something. Oh, yeah, sorry. We don't actually have Wi-Fi or cell phone signal here for the next ten days. - What? - What are you gonna do? - No. No, no. - Yeah. - That's not fair. - No, you'll be all right. - Whatever. - What? There's plenty to see, though. Don't worry. You won't miss your phone. This is so back-in-the-day. Yeah. So, ladies, you are through here. Uh, sorry. I know it doesn't look like much, but they're more comfortable than they look. Did Mom shoot some of these? Oh, wow. You still got these? - Yeah, of course, man. - Okay. Oh. This... This little bump right here, you know who that is? That's you. These photos are amazing. Wow. Mom looks so young and beautiful. Where'd she shoot this one? That's just up the road here. I love this tree. - Is that a self-portrait? - Yeah. She spent so much time there, we actually called it the Amahle Tree. She loved to photograph that thing. - Can you take that salad through for us? - Okay. Mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm. Smells good. Mmm. - Yep. It's ready, man. - Okay. All right. Where's Mare? Uh, she's in there unpacking. Oh. Okay. - Hey, Mare. - Hey. Dinner's ready. Thanks. So, you got everything you need? I was the one who packed your suitcase, Dad. Yes, yes, you did. Yes, you did. So, did I get everything I need? Hey, dinner's ready, okay? You just said that. No, I know I just said that. I just, uh... And this is all with the... the long exposure - with your mom's... your mom's old Nikon? - Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. We got to restock. Some people think it's old-school, but I just prefer film. Film is old-school, but, I mean... - I love shooting with film. - Yeah? - Yeah. - That is really amazing. - Thank you. - Eh? Nate, you see this? - Look at this work. - Oh, yeah. - Eh? - No, I haven't seen that one, but, uh... - It's just like your mom's stuff. - Yeah. - It's actually got the same kind of soul to it. - Yeah. - You are really talented. - I applied to the Tisch School of the Arts at NYU. Okay, okay. Is that a big... it's a big art school? - Oh, is it? - Yeah, it's a big school. - It's the best school. - Well, you're gonna get in. - Thank you. I hope I do. - Wow. Yeah. She's gonna get in. Watch. Mark my words. She didn't apply for the medical school - like Daddy wanted. - No, and she shouldn't. No, you shouldn't, 'cause one doctor's enough in your family. - Everything... - What? No, look. No, I-I tell her all the time that I love her work. She got that, um... What is that, uh, one that's on the fridge? It's like, uh, a blue car, and there's a building in the back. Dad, the car is not blue. It's red. - It's not red. - It's red. - It's blue, right? - It's a red car, Dad, - and that was five years ago. - Oh. Sorry, I meant red. - Yeah, of course you did. - I said blue, uh, but it... Okay, uh, what are you into nowadays, young lady? This minute, I'm thinking about going into psychology. - Mare. - You know, family therapy, maybe. - Hey. Mare. Mare. - Probably a good idea. If you got a problem, just... - Come on. Nate, just... - ...just say it. My problem is that in the last ten minutes, Martin just showed more interest in my photography than you have in the last year. - What? - Which is the same amount of time that you showed our mother in the last year of her life. Mare. She got sick. You missed it - 'cause you had already left us. - No, no, no. - No, it's not what happened. I tried. - Dad. Your mother and I, we mutually... mutually agreed to separate, and then she got sick. - Norah, no, don't go. - It's okay. - I'll go to her, Dad. - Come on. What are you talking about? Norah. Hey, Norah? Sorry, I shouldn't have brought this up. Not in front of Norah. You okay? Got us another bottle before we can't stand up. Ah. Always thinking ahead. - That's what I like about you. - Yeah. Okay? In a pinch, I have been known, - on occasion... - Mm-hmm. ...when necessary, to crawl around my house on all fours looking for another bottle. The house. What a... What about the yard? - Uh, yeah. - What about the yard? The garden. Definitely the garden. - Mmm. - What do you got? - That's a bit much. - Too strong? Yeah, a little strong. - Lord. - Hey. Cheers, man. It's good to have you back. Can I ask you a question? Why didn't you come to the funeral? Okay. Um, honestly? Yeah. Why? I... didn't want to see her buried in a concrete plot in New York City. I didn't... couldn't stomach it, and I didn't think that that's what she would've wanted, either. Maybe we should just agree to leave it at that. You know, Mare is right. Come on, man. She's in a lot of pain. Yeah, she is. And she fights. Man, she fights just like her mom. She does. Yeah. What I wouldn't do to fight with that woman just one more time. Now my wife's gone. Mare's gone. Norah is hanging on by a thread. See, I missed all the signs. I missed all the signs of my marriage. I missed the signs of my kids. And I missed the signs of her cancer. That's not your fault. That's not how it works. I... Hey, hey, I'm a doctor, okay? I'm a doctor, and I know what death looks like. And I know that death walked up the steps to where my kids and my wife were sleeping, knocked on the door, and guess what. I wasn't home. I wasn't home... to look it in the eye and say, "No. No, you can't take her." I failed those kids. Do you understand? It's why we're here. Stop beating yourself up, Nate. This cancer was always gonna kill her. Nothing you could do. I wasn't there, man. I wasn't there. Yes. Same place as last time. Yeah, copy that. In the valley by the abandoned schoolhouse. Thanks, Banji. - Hey. - Morning, big guy. How's your head? Ah, little fuzzy. Yeah, mine, too. Everything all right? Yeah. I'm gonna give you guys the VIP tour today. We'll go through the private section of the reserve, avoid the tourists. - Morning. - What do you mean, "give me the hat"? It's my hat. - Just be us and the wildlife. - It's not your hat. - Morning, ladies. - Mare, it says so very clearly right here on the tag that this is my hat. Just because you wrote your name on a hat - doesn't mean it's now yours. - Mare, honestly, - this is my hat. - Just give me my hat, please. Come on. Hey, guys. Uncle Martin just said good morning. Good morning, Uncle Martin. - Mare, it's my hat. - It's not your hat. - I'm the one who packed it. - Here you go, Mare. Okay? - You don't even need it. - That settles the hat issues. It's too small to even fit your big ol' head anyway. Now you're ready for safari. Yes. Where are we heading? Uh, to see some of the most incredible creatures on the planet, hopefully. We got Milkshake Mare. We got Mini Nugget Norah. We got McDouble Martin. And Super size Nugget Nate. Look at that just... Waterbuck. Here, here, here, here. Giraffe. Oh, my gosh. They're so cute. There's the old schoolhouse. So Banji will be just around the corner here. They put a school in the middle of rocks? Yeah. It used to be used by the... families that worked in the mine over the hill there. But then the copper mine ran dry, so, uh, they shut down the school. Ah, there's our man. Stay close to the vehicle, please, okay? - Come on. - Banji. - Hey, Martin. - Look at that. - Oh, my gosh. - This is amazing, man. Ah. It's perfect. Thank you. - Yeah. - Nate, this is Banji. Banji, this is my friend Nate - and his daughters. - Hi, Banji. -Hey, Nate. - I'm good. I'm good. - These are my daughters. - This is Norah and Mare. - Hello. -Hello. -Hey. Oh, my God. That's beautiful. - Yeah. - Look. Banji tracks the movement of the pride through the reserve. - Yeah. - That's a great job. Hey, man. Thank you. And that up there is the Nandi pride. - Yep. - It's named after that magnificent matriarch in the middle there. Wow. Yep, and the males are Kuda and his brother Kawe. - Kawe? - Kawe? - Kawe. Kawe. - Kawe. Kawe. And are we, uh... are we safe right here? Oh, you're safe. You're safe. They just finished off last night's kill. - Okay, good. - Yeah. - That is insane. - We should go close... Okay. It's all right. - You're scared. You're okay. He's just letting you know that he's there. You're scared. You got scared. See, the way it works with lions is the females do the hunting, the males protect the pride. Well, protect them from what? Usually from other lions. Any lion from outside the family comes into their territory, Kuda and Kawe will leap onto it, start ripping it apart limb from limb or die trying. It's the law of the jungle, guys. It's the only law that matters out here. What kind of rifle is that? Oh, it's a trank rifle. You know, just in case. Hope we don't need it. Hopefully. Shall we do this? - Yep. - All right. So you just, like, put it there? - Okay, so the dart goes... - All right, so they usually go after the smallest one, so you might want to hang on to that. - What? Really? - Just in case. No, I'm kidding. - No, you can't have this. - You definitely can't. Wait, you're not going out there, right? Shh. - What is he doing? - He's gonna... He's gonna go. - Mare. - What? - Where you going? - Just going to take some pictures. Why do you always have to be such a daredevil? - Nothing's gonna happen. - Mare, you're gonna be - the death of me. Come here. - Wait, what's he doing? Just showing them he's not afraid. He raised them from cubs, actually. Sent them out to the wild when they were still young. - Hey, boys. - Wait. I see you, boys. Hello, my boys. Hello. I see you there. Easy. Easy, easy. Okay. Ah. Who's a big boy, eh? Who's a big boy? Oh. Hey. Hey. Whoa. Okay. Easy, Kuda. Don't play so rough. Don't play so rough, my boy. Don't play so rough. You also want some love? You want some love, yeah. Hang on, hang on. What's happened to... What's happened to your girl? What's wrong with Nandi? Nandi? You okay, my girl? Okay. Okay. Just coming a little closer. What's wrong with your paw, girl? Please, just a little bit closer. Let me look at you. I just want to have a look. Let me see. Okay. All right. Okay, I'm going. I'm going. - Banji. - Yeah? - She's got a wound on her paw. - Ah. I think it's a bullet, but I can't be sure. I've got to get in closer, but that's not gonna happen now, so see if you can find a vet. Okay. There's just too many now. Yeah, probably, man. What is... - Damn it. - It's poachers. - Oh. - Illegal hunters. - That was really nice, Uncle Martin. - See that? You always got to make a show of yourself, huh? - You want to have a go? - Me? - Yeah. -No. - Go on, Dad. - Try it. Just once. - Oh, no. You know, just hug a lion and, uh, take a picture with Mare. My dad's not much of a hugger. - No? -Nah. -What? - More of a fist bumper. I am a hugger. Well, I'm gonna try and get some help. - It was very nice to meet you. - Very nice to meet you, too. - All right, Banji. - All right, Nate. - Cheers, Banji. - Uh, Dr. Nate, brother. What happened out there? She wasn't too happy. Uh, it's the female. She's got wounded. Wounded? How? Poachers. There's a Tsonga village just up the road, guys. Do you mind if we stop by there? - No. Let's do it. - Just want to ask people - if they saw anything. - Come on. -Let's go. So you think, uh, maybe someone at the village might have seen what happened? Yeah. Seen something, heard something. Anything unusual, you know? So, you're sure you don't want a lion hug? Last chance. Eh? - No, I'm good. - All right. Good. It's getting worse and worse. The poachers used to just be after the elephants and the rhinos. Now they're actively going after the lions. - Why? - They sell the teeth, the claws, even the bones on the black market. - That's horrible. - Yeah. There's a market for them now as well. The bones? - Well... - I don't know, man. I mean, I-I've read about the anti-poachers online, - and they said that... - Stop it. What? You read about the anti-poachers online? - Yes. - Really? And what did it say, Norah? - Well... - No, what did it say? Okay. Well, they said that people have actually hunted down and killed the poachers. I mean, y-you've heard of stories like that, right, Uncle Martin? - Right? - Um, yeah. So, are you some kind of an anti-poacher? I mean, we just... we're just trying to protect the animals in every sense. Okay, so, guys, listen, this is not a tourist village. Okay? It's a... It's an actual real place where people live. Thank you. Please just be as polite as possible. Maybe get a little drink at the bar. - Hair of the dog? - Oh, no. Mare, you can take pictures, - but just ask them first, okay? - Okay. The Tsonga are some of the most polite and kind people you'll ever meet. They speak a type of Venda. Well, Mom was actually teaching Norah and I. - Really? - Before she died. Wow, you sound good. I like that. Thanks, Dad. Where is everybody? - Hello? - Hello? Hello? Hey, Norah. Look, Norah. - There's goats. - The fire's still hot. Hey there, buddy. Don't they look like, uh, dalmatian dogs? Hey. ...Mare, you can't take pictures, Mare. - Doesn't matter. - Mare, stop taking pictures. - Why? - Stop. Stop. Just... Shh. They're so cute. Do you think Uncle Martin kills poachers? What do you think, Miss Know-It-All? But that's what the article said anti-poachers do. Come on. Norah! - What? - You can't just wander off. Come on. Does that frighten you? No. I have a rainbow of emotions at my disposal, Mare. Well, you look scared to me, Norah. - I'm not scared, Mare. - Uh-huh. Hey, guys. Don't walk off. Just stay close. All right? Hey, Martin. Let's, uh... let's get out of here, okay? Yeah, okay. Jesus. Hang on, hang on. - Nate, go back to the girls. - What? Go back to the girls right now. Don't let them come in here. - Dad, what is it? - Dad, what's going on? Uh, it's okay. Just, uh, stay close, okay? Martin? Oh, my God. Jesus Christ. Guys, you got to, uh... you got to go. - You can't see, okay? - What's wrong? I just need you to walk away for a second, okay? - I'll be right there. - Okay. What happened in here? I have no idea, man. Jesus Christ. Some of them are my friends. Shit. What did this? Only thing that makes any sense is a lion, but... - cats don't do this, you know? - What? Lions don't do this. I've heard stories, but no lion that I've ever seen. Any alive over there? No. Oh, shit. Most of this village is women and kids, bro. Think the rest of them got away? Huh? I hope so. Okay, this is... this is bad. With this much blood, there should be hyenas around already. What does that mean? It means that whatever did this is... Still out there? Huh? I'm gonna get the gun. Go get the girls. Okay. Uh, Mare! - Dad. - We got to go. Norah. Where is your sister? She was playing with the goats. - Where is she? - I don't know. Norah? Well, she-she... - Where's Norah? - Dad, she was just behind me. What do you mean, she was just... - Norah, come on! - Norah, we got to go, baby! Let's go! - Norah! - Mare, where is she? I don't know if she's hid... I don't know where she... - What are you talking... Norah! - Norah! Hey! Norah, we got to go! Norah, come on! You had one job, Mare. That's all. Look after your sister. - Norah! - Norah, come on! - Hey, Norah! - Norah! Go check over there. Go check over there. - Norah! - Norah! Norah, can you hear me? - Norah! - Norah! - Mare, please! - Hey. Norah! Can you hear me? Shit. Norah! - Where you at? - Dad! Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, baby. You okay? You okay? Are you hurt? Are you hurt? Huh? Look at me, look at me. Okay. She got... Banji, do you copy? We've got a situation in the village. Norah, don't worry. We're gonna be fine. Norah. Banji, Banji, come in. It's Martin. Are you still in the field? Hey, Norah. Hey, Norah, it's gonna be okay. Ah, it's not gonna work. The mountain blocks the CB radio signal. There's a seasonal outpost about six K's up the road here, so I'm just gonna go down there and call it in. I can't... Dad, I want to go home. No, we're gonna go home, all right? Call whoever you got to when we get back. Listen, there's like 15 families in that village, okay? I know some of those people. I'm not gonna leave them out here. Do you think there's anybody still alive? I don't know. - Hey, what's that? - Please! - Hold up. Slow down. - Help me! Slow down. Slow down. Okay, guys, just stay in the car. - Wait, what? - It's okay. - What's he doing? - It's okay. It's all right. - Mutende. - Hey, Martin. One second, girls. - How many lions? Lions. - It's okay. How many? He's from the village. He needs help. Keep the girls in the car. - Are you okay? Is he okay? - What's going on? He'll be fine. Just stay in the car. - Is he gonna be okay? - Okay? Just stay in the car. Just-just-just... just hold on. Hey. - His name is Mutende. - Okay. - And he-he went with a couple other guys... - Okay. - ...to try to take it out, like I thought. - Hey, man. Okay. - It got his brother as well. - You got a aid kit? Yeah, there's one in the... there's one in the car. Okay. What's he saying? - It means "devil." - Devil. Okay. All right, M-Mutende... All right, just relax, okay? - Hey, what is it? - Shh. - Hey. - Shh, shh, shh, shh. - Hey, Martin. Come back. - Go back to the girls. Hey, buddy, come here, okay? - Nate, go back to the car. - Just relax, okay? All right, we just got to get this guy out of here. Okay. Just stay here, okay? I'll be right back. - Dad. - Where's the medical kit? - Where's the medical kit? - Wha-What? - What? Was it a lion? - Martin said there was - a medical kit in here. Where is it? - Dad! - What? - Was it a lion? - Be quiet. - Yes. Okay? - Wha... - Now, just relax. - Dad, what's going on? - Okay. All right. No, no. - Lions? - Uncle Martin's out there. - Um, see if you can... - Yes, Norah. ...find someone on the radio. Okay, but Martin said that we're out of range here. I don't care what Martin said. Try. - Okay, but, Dad, what do I say? - Okay? Dad, what do I say? Dad! - Um, just tell them that... - Dad, what... Tell them that we're outside Tsonga village, all right? - Tsonga village. Okay. - Two miles on the road. We got a injured male. Tell them... - Just don't panic, okay? - Okay. - Mare. - Okay, uh... Hello? Hello? They're gonna answer. Help. Can someone hear me? Help. Can somebody please hear me? Hey, man. Hey. Hey. You okay? Oh, come on, now. Hang in there. Hang in there. Come on. Come on. Come on. Okay. It's okay. What was that? Martin! Hey! Hey! Dad, come back! - Okay. - Dad! - Okay, I'm gonna go outside. Just... - Wait, Mare. Please. - No, just stay. Just stay right... - Please. Mare! - Please! Don't leave me! - Stay. Just breathe. It's okay. - Norah, I'm right here. - Hey, man. You up here? Huh? Martin! Shit. Get in the car! - Get in the car now! - Dad! Whoa. Whoa! You guys okay? You guys okay? Norah, stay down. Stay down. Stay down. Stay down. Stay down. Stay down. Stay down. It's okay. It's okay. Get over there, Mare! Get over there! Get... Take the wheel! Take the wheel, Mare! Drive! Drive! Watch out! Watch out! Don't hit the man! Okay. Okay. Hey. Hey, Mare. Mare. Mare, you okay? Come here. Come here. Look at me. - Did you hurt yourself, huh? - Dad. - Where's the lion? - Okay. Hey. Hey, Norah. Norah. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Breathe. Breathe. Slow down. Like that. There you go. That's it. You're doing good. Doing good. Okay, baby, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. What the hell just happened? Is it still out there? Be careful. Don't cut yourself. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Just-just stay right there. The lion really smashed out that window. - Move over. - What happened to Uncle Martin? Ow! Oh, my leg. It got me good. We got to go get some help, okay? Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come... Come on, come on, come on. - Are we trapped here? - No. No, Norah, we're not trapped here, okay? Someone will find us. - Someone will come by. - We don't know that. Uncle Martin said that this part of the reserve is closed to the public. And the radio is just static, Dad. - Do we even know where we are? - Mare. - Do we know where we... - Mare! Come on. Just stop, okay? Just stop. Guys? What-what if that thing isn't gone? - It could still be out here. - Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. - No, she's right. - Wait. No, no, no, no, no. No, but we didn't get very far, Dad. It could still be out there. Nate, come in. Whoa. What is that, now? Wait. - Can you hear the radio? - Nate, can you hear me? Can you hear it? Oh. - Hey, Martin. - Nate, I can hear you. - Can you... can you hear me? - Hey. Yes. Yes, we hear you. Do you copy? Yes, N-Nate, I copy you. I copy you. What happened, man? Did you get attacked? I'm, uh... I'm in a bad way, bro. You're in a bad way? What happened? What kind of condition you in? The lion... The lion, uh, just came out of nowhere, you know? And, um, I can't stand. Um, my leg's, uh... My leg's torn up. I'm losing too much blood. I think I'm gonna pass out. Are the girls okay? - And M-Mutende, is he okay? - Yeah. Yeah, look, no, Mutende, he... he didn't make it, okay? He didn't make it, but the girls are okay. We're here. We're okay. And, um, the truck... the... It's dead, man. Um... Hey, man, I don't know what to do right now. Okay? I don't know what to do. Okay, you-you want to just, um, stay there. Someone will come. And, uh, stay in the car. I'm-I'm seeing... I'm seeing, uh, st... Whew. I'm seeing stars, man, feeling dizzy. Hey, Martin, listen to me. Um, you're gonna go into shock, all right? I need you to stop the bleeding. - Mare, is he okay? - Yeah. He's gonna be okay. Needless to say, all right? I need you to take your belt off, uh... uh, wrap it around your leg, and I need you to pull that shit tight. I did that already, but, um, it's not really helping. I've... I... He went really deep, man. It's all the way to the bone. Y-You did that? Okay. Okay. Um, do you have your lighter on you? That Zippo? Uh, yeah, yeah. Yes. You got that? All right, do me a favor. Take your knife out, all right? You're not gonna like me for this, man, but I need you to heat that knife as hot as it can get. It needs to be as hot as Hades, man. Then you need to put it on the artery. All right? And you need to lay it on there while it's really hot. All right? We're gonna stop the bleeding. How much time? We need to go get him. Hold on, Mare. Hold on. And how's that doing? Is it hot? Yeah. All right, tell me when it's done, man. Come on, tell me when it's done. Okay, I'm gonna go for it. - Hey, man, I heard you. - He's okay. I actually heard you. You're close by. So listen, um... I'm gonna try and come to you, okay? Is he okay? Do you understand that, Martin? I'm gonna try and come to you. - Where is he? - Uh... Dad, here. He's probably... N-Negative, Nate. Um, I'm not alone. Uh, what? He's staring right at me. The lion is staring right at you? - Oh, my God. - Why would he do that? Okay, Dad, we have to go get him. Hold on. The son of a bitch is staring right at me. Dad, we have to go and get him now. That doesn't sound right, man. What's going on? Dude, that doesn't sound, uh, natural. If I didn't know any better, I'd say I'm the bait. We-we got to come get you, man. If you stay by there, you're gonna die. Dad, he's gonna bleed out. We gonna figure this out. We can't leave him out there. You don't understand. We're in his territory now. Okay, Martin, just listen. Just sit tight, okay? I got to think about this, okay? Wait, Dad, what about the trank rifle? - Where is it? Go find it. Go find it. - Yeah. -Uh... - Martin, I can't leave you out there, buddy. - Okay. Okay. - No way. - I don't see anything. - Do you see it? -No. I don't. - No, but I know... You don't see it? Hold up. Let me get back there. Norah, just move over there. - Oh, uh, Dad, your leg. - Just move over there. - Wait, wait, wait. Dad. - Just move over there, okay? Wait. Dad! - What? - Listen to me. - Your leg, it is torn up. - My leg's what? Ah, shit. It's not that bad. It's all right. It's stopped. - Okay. - It's just superficial, okay? - It's all right. Do you see it? - No, don't see it. No? What about this box? Check this box. - It-it-it's locked. - It's locked? - Dang it. - Um, see... Hey, see if there's a key right in there. - No, it's just the one. - Nothing? - Uh, check the glove box real quick. - Okay. Um... There's nothing in the glove box. - Hold on. - It's not loosening. - Oh, God. - Whew! - Are you okay? - You all good? - Yeah, I'm good. - Okay. Good job, good job. - Get it. - Watch your fingers. - Now, what's the plan? Um... - Okay, uh... We got, uh... That's it. Dad, uh, do you know how to put that thing together? - No, I have no idea. - I know how. How do you know how to put it together? Because I-I paid attention when Banji assembled it earlier. - It can't be that hard. - Did you, now? How does that go? All right, so you know how to use this? - Uh, no. - To use that, press that button only when you're talking, all right? - Okay, okay. - So, where does this go? - What did Banji say? - Make sure the numbers... Dad, make sure the numbers go there. - Right here? - Yeah. - Hey, Martin, can you hear me? - And then screw it. Screw it in right here? Martin, can you hear me? Are you still there? - I'm here. - Whew. Okay, good. We have the, um... the trank rifle. If we shoot this thing, it might just buy us - some time to come get you. - No. No, no, no. That's a... That's a terrible idea. That's... We got to try. Okay? The lion's moved off. I do not have eyes on the lion. He's wandered off. - What? - What? Stay in the vehicle. Martin, we don't have a choice right now. It's the best we can do. You-you're only gonna have one shot, man, but if-if you... if you can hit it, it should buy us a couple hours, yeah. I got it. W-We're not gonna leave you there, okay? We just can't do that. You want to... you want to get... You want to get somewhere high, you know? - Open the sunroof. - Okay. - Dad, no, you got to... - No, no, no, no. Not that one. - No, guys! Wait, wait. - Can you just stop touching it? Please stop touching. Just stay in the car, okay? Okay. All right, be careful. - Okay, okay. - Dad. - Be careful up there. - Please. Stay away from the broken window. All right. Pass me that gun. - You got it? - Yeah. Okay. - Are you good? - All right. - Get Martin on the radio. - Okay. Ask him, uh, what I'm supposed to look for. What should he be looking for? Movement. Anything that casts a shadow. - What? What'd he say? - Look for the shadows. - Shadows? Um... - Shadows, yeah. Like a shadow moving. Okay. Um... It's just a bunch of shadows. - Uh... - Do you see anything? No, I don't see... - Dad, do you see it? - Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. No. Ask him where he is or something. Ask him for a landmark near him. Something else, something I... something I can see. Is there any landmark that he can find? Anything to find you. Where are you? Can he see the hunter's blind? - What'd he say? - What's a hunter's blind? He said look for a hunter's blind. Hunter's blind? What does that look like? What does it look like? It's the only man-made thing... It's on stilts. The only man-made thing on stilts, Dad. Uh... Hold on. I don't see it. I don't see it. I don't see anything. Uh... I don't see it. Uh... - No, I don't see... Do you see it? - Dad! Dad, Dad, it's right there! - Where? -Where? Where? - It's right over there, Dad. - Can you see it? R-Right there. - I don't see it. - Where? - I don't see it. - Hold on. I see it. - Where are you going? - Stop moving the car! - Where are you... Mare! - Stop rocking the... - Where are you going? - Mare! - Mare, what the hell are you doing? I'm gonna check if I can see Uncle Martin. - Get back in the car right now. - Mare! Mare! No, we have to do something, or he's gonna die. - I'm not going anywhere. I'm... - Mare, come back! I'll do it! Get back in the car! I'm gonna check if I can see him. Mare! I'll go! Mare, I said I'll go! Dad! It's here! It's here! Run, Mare! - Get away from the car now! - Here! - Pass me another! Quick! Pass it! Quick! - Here! - Here, Dad! Take it! - Toss it. Dad! Stay away, Mare! Hey! Dad, are you okay? Dad! Dad! Dad, please answer me! Please, Dad! Dad, look, the gun is on the other side. It's right there. Dad, he's coming! No, no. Norah! Get away from the window! Stay in the back! Dad, please help! He's on the car! Dad! Dad, get the gun. Dad, grab it! Hurry up! - Uncle Martin. - I'm here. I'm here. I'm coming. - Are you okay? - Mare, what are you doing here? Don't worry. I'm gonna get you back to the cruiser, okay? I told you to stay in the car. I'm gonna get you back, Uncle Martin. - Dad, are you okay? - Yeah. Yeah. You okay? - Yeah. Yes. - Is it gone? Huh? - Is it gone? - Yeah, it's gone. Yeah. Are you okay? Okay. Okay. You okay? - Yeah. - All right. Good job. - Good job. Good job. - Thank you. Close the window. Okay? Close the window. Hey, Mare! Mare, come back! Hey, Mare, can you hear me? I'll get your sister, okay? Stay right there. Hey, Mare, can you hear me? Dad? Norah? - Shh. - Okay. - Hey, Mare, come in. - Okay. Martin, you okay? Yeah, we're fine. Are you guys okay? What happened to the lion? Your sister stuck a dart in his ass. She did? Yeah, she sure did. Okay. Well, we're almost there, and we're okay. Come on. One, two... Go ahead. - Okay. - It's okay. - It's okay, Uncle Martin. - Okay. - I think I got it. - It's okay. I think I got it. Hey, Mare. Uh, Mare, can you pass the tweezers right there? - Uh-huh. Which one? - I need... Yep, yep, that one. I want you to clamp this right here. Hold on tight and do not let go. Do you understand? All right. Uh, Norah, can you check in that box... The aid box... if they got some sutures in there? Can you tell me what they got? - Uh, there's, uh, nylon... - What do they have? - ...silk and polypropylene. - Okay, man. Okay, give me a 16-millimeter silk. - Um, there's 3/018-millimeter silk. - Good job. All right, it's not perfect but will do. - Are your hands clean? - Definitely not. Take a-a alcohol swab, wipe your hands, and then, uh, pass the, uh, suture packet with the needle up, okay? - Okay. - Okay, Mare. You okay? - All right. - He's bleeding out a lot. It's gonna be all... I know. I know. Just relax, okay? How you doing, Norah? Okay. All right, he's gonna pass out in a second, all right? - He's gonna be all right. All right? - Yeah. There you go. No, turn it around. Turn it around for me. Good job. - All right. - Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. - Okay, you can let go. - Okay. - Guys. Guys. - Did a good job, okay? - Good job. - What about the lion? Martin said the tranquilizer would keep him out for a couple of hours. We'll be long gone by then. But it's the same lion, isn't it? The one that killed all those people in the village? It has to be. Norah, are you sure you put a dart in that thing? - What? - Oh, God. Yes. Oh, my gosh. - Yes. - Oh, my God. Dad, the tranquilizer's wearing off already. All right. Don't panic, okay? I thought he'd be out for hours. Hello? Is anyone out there? Over. Please, we need help. If anyone can hear me, someone please answer. Guys, we got to consider that we're gonna be in this vehicle for a while, all right? So... Cruiser's dead, and as long as that thing is out there, we got to conserve this water. How much do we have? Well, um, you got one there. Uh, whatever's in these four bottles for now. - Dad, this is not enough. - I know, but it's gonna - have to last till tomorrow. - No, not for four people. It's gonna have to last till tomorrow. Tomorrow? Hey, someone's gonna come find us. I promise you, okay? - Don't make another promise you can't keep. - Hey. What are you talking about? How about the time you took Norah on that carriage ride and you promised her that - our mother wasn't gonna die? - What? - No, that's not fair. - Norah came home that night, and she was happy, and she held my hands and she assured me that our mother was gonna be okay because you promised. Mare, will you just shut the hell up - for one God dang second, please? - That's not fair. - Norah, he... -All right. - All you ever do is talk. Okay, guys. Just stop for a second, okay? - Come on, Mare. - Hey. Norah, look at me. I'm sorry, Dad. Norah, don't be sorry. I cannot believe you right now. I always thought you guys would get back together. I did, too. I'm sorry. Hey. Tell me that I'm home in bed. You're home in bed, man. Warm, comfortable. See, here's some water. Promise. Just relax. Don't do too much. There you go. There you go, man. The girls okay? Yeah. Thank God. What happened with the lion? Tranquilizer didn't seem to affect it much, but I haven't seen it since before dark. Mm. Maybe it gave up. Maybe. Maybe not. It's, uh... Everybody knows that a wounded lion is dangerous, but I've never seen anything like this. Multiple attacks without eating its prey. Attacking a vehicle. Lions don't do that. It's like he-he... he knows who his real enemy is. Meaning what? The poachers, you know? They take out the lions, they split up the prides, and then... Well... now they're fighting back. This lion's gone rogue because they killed his pride, and now he's coming after all of us. I've got to get my girls out of here. Mmm. Hmm. The radio don't work. We ain't got no water. Look, man, I can't... I can't help you. Barely feel my leg. You can't go out there on your own. You're miles from anywhere. The best thing you can do is stay here and wait for help to come. You go out there without a weapon, it'll be you versus him, and that is not a fight that you are designed to win. You're doing right by these girls today. Amahle would be proud of you. Don't go. Don't go. Hey. You guys drink the water? Why you got to drink the... Mare. Mare. Norah. Norah. Hey, Martin. Martin. Where are the... Where are the girls? Hey. Hey. Girls. Hey. What... Hey. Mare! Norah! Shit. What the... Mare! Hey, girls! Oh! Nathaniel. Nathaniel. I need you. I need you near me. - I need you. - Are you okay? Amahle. Are you okay? - Mare. - Hmm? What's wrong? I loved your mom. Okay? I loved her with everything I had to give. I promise you. It just wasn't working. I thought I had more time. Thought I could solve it. Now every time I look at you, I see so much of her in you. I need you to forgive me. Can you do that? What was that? I don't know. You turn the radio on? I never... I never turned it off. It just... But, Dad, maybe somebody heard me. - Maybe it's a rescue party. - Let me turn it up. Hold on. Hold on. Hold up. Can you hear 'em? Uh... - Are they saying something? - What did he say? Hey, copy. Do-do you hear us? - Tell them where we are. - I'm trying. Uh... ...Can't make out what they're saying. - Kees. - Hey, copy. Can you hear us? Hey. Is that them? Is that... I think they heard. Dad, they've got guns. - Why do they have guns? - Oh, they're poachers. - Oh, God. - They're poachers, all right? Whatever happens, just stay in the vehicle. Hey. Just stay in the vehicle, okay? Hey. - Hey, what's up? Uh... - Hey, hey. Wait, wait. Uh, hey. Hold on. Hey, hey. Hold on, man. - You hold on. You hold on. - Okay. Okay. Hey, what's up? We need some help, okay? We-we-we were attacked, and we need some help. - You're American. - Yeah. Long way from home, American. Yeah. Uh, look, my friend's in a bad... - Who are they? - Those are my daughters. Those are my two daughters, okay? And, uh, my friend is in a bad way. He needs some help right now. - Um... - You shouldn't be out here. - It's a very dangerous place. - No, I know that. And, um, I was attacked, and I'm telling you, man, I just need a ride out of here. That's all. - Attacked by what? - A lion. It was huge. It took out the-the whole village. That's the big male that got away. He's from the pride that we killed last night. Hey, excuse me. Hey. Hey. Hey, we need to all get out of here, okay? When last have you seen this lion? I don't know. It was like t-two hours. Brother, brother, can I pay you? - H-H-Hey. - Brother, can I pay you? - Not brother of yours, man. - No, no, no. I'm just saying, you... you guys are poachers, right? - We can take American dollars. - We're not poachers. All right, I won't say... Hey, man. You got to put that down, okay? Those are my daughters. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! - No, no, no, no. Just relax. - You can take American dollars? - Yes, I-I got... - I can pay you. Yes. - 5,000 American dollars. Yes, I got you, okay? All right? We need to unload the cargo before we get to the village, eh? Um, thank you. I appreciate it. And I won't say a word. You say there are three inside, including your friend? - Yeah. Just, uh... - Dad, what's happening? They're gonna help us get out of here. What the hell is this? - Whoa, whoa! What the... - Dad! - I know this man. - Hey, hey! Hey, relax! - Okay, okay. It's all right, baby. - He's an anti-poacher! Hey, what are you doing, man? Put the gun down. - Put the gun down. - He killed three of my men. Okay, man. Just relax, okay? Just relax. All right? - Hey, don't touch her! - Dad! - No! No, no, no, no! - Keep him there! Stay down! Let her go. Stop! Stop! Stop! It's coming! Norah! Norah, come here! Come here! Okay. Okay. All right, let's get out of here. Come on. Get in! Get in. You okay? Mare, you okay? All right. Here's our chance to get out of here, okay? Get the water. Get the medical supplies. I'm gonna get that truck, I'm gonna back it up, and we're gonna put Uncle Martin in it, all right? - Okay. Okay. - It's okay, stay here. It's okay. You're gonna get help, okay? No. Come on. No, no, no, no, no! - There's no keys. - What happened? One of them's got the keys. - What? - I got to go get the keys. - Dad, you don't know how to hot-wire a car? - No. I do not know how to hot-wire a car. I went to medical school. Well, you should've double-majored or something. The guy in the yellow shirt, he was driving... I got to find him. - He must have the keys. - Dad, please don't go. That truck is the only way we can get out of here. - No. - He must've gone that way, all right? He couldn't have gone far. You heard the gunshots. - They were close. - No. I don't like it. Mare, I'm not asking you to like it. I'm asking you to look after Norah and look after Uncle Martin. All right? Can you do that? I've got the walkie. I'll be ten minutes. - Okay. - That's all. Please, Daddy. You cannot get hurt. - You have to be careful. - Hey, what's my name? Super size Nugget Nate. That's right. Nate, Nate. Get his gun. Okay. All right. - Ten minutes. - Be careful. Dad, please be careful. Hey. Oh. I need them keys, man. Dad? Dad? Dad, can you hear us? Dad? Dad, say something, please. Oh, please, Dad. Please. Dad? Can you hear me? Dad, say something, please. Dad, can you hear me? Mare, do you see him? - No. - Well, it's been ten minutes already. I know, Norah. Mare, y-you know, we should try him on the walkie again. We can't, Norah. He's not responding. What? I mean, we've got to do something, Mare. I know we have... - What? - What? Mare, don't let him in, please. Mare, you can't. Mare, please. Look at his... Is Dad okay? Mare, where did he go? Dad, please come back. Please. Sorry about this, man. Hey. It's me. Can you hear me? Dad, is that you? Copy, copy. I made it. I made it. I'm here. I got the keys. I'm coming back, okay? I'm coming back. Are you okay? Here, Uncle Martin. Have some water. Thanks. Mmm. Here. What? What's wrong? Don't move. Okay, look away from him. Don't look into his eyes. Just move away from this window. Move into the seat. Stay calm. I'm watching him. - Norah. Shh. - Mare, are you okay? - You have to stay still. - There you go, boy. - Are you okay? - It's okay. Shh. You have to stay still, okay? Okay, I think we're gonna be good. The car's gonna tip! Go, guys! - Go, Norah! Now! - Go! Get out! Hide in the Land Rover now! Go, go, go, go, go! - He got me! - Go! Come on, you bastard! I'm sorry, boy. - Norah. - Dad! Shit. What's the fire? - The truck went off the cliff. - Where's Mare? She's inside, but she got hurt. - She got hurt? - Yeah, by the lion. - Hey. Mare. - Dad. - You okay? - I don't know. - I think I'm okay. - All right? Where's Uncle Martin? Huh? He was in the cruiser when it rolled over. Dad, I don't think he made it. What? Let me take a look. - Oh, my God. - Is it bad? - No, no, no, no. No, no. It's not bad. - Okay. Uh, I just got to put some, uh, pressure on it, okay? - Okay. - All right? - Norah, you okay? - Yeah. Are you okay? - All right, just lean forward a little bit like this. - Okay. - All right. - It's okay, Mare. Okay. All right. Look at me. - Look at me. Okay? - Okay. Okay. - We're good. You all right? - It's okay, Mare. - Yeah. - Okay. It's all right. - It's okay, Mare. - It's all right. - It's okay. - Just stay here, okay? Okay. It's okay, Mare. You're okay. Martin. All right, guys. We're trying to backtrack from where we was yesterday, okay? - Okay. - I don't think we got enough fuel, so... keep an eye out for something that we might have seen, all right? - Okay. Okay. - Okay? Mare, you okay? I'm okay. I'm just a little nauseous. All right. Look... - All right. Okay. - It's okay. Hey, if you feel like you got to throw up, I need you to breathe through it, all right? I don't want you to strain your abdomen. - Okay. - I don't know how deep that wound is. You understand? Let me see you do it. Let me see. There you go. Keep your eyes on the horizon, okay? - Okay. - You're gonna be okay. There you go. No, no, no. - Dad, look. - What? The lions. That's the pride that Banji showed us. Yeah, there was a school right around the corner. Yeah, right up here. Wait, Dad. Dad, why are we stopping? I don't want to run out of gas in the middle of nowhere. Not with you in this state. I'll see if I can find something to dress the wound. - But, Dad, we... - Norah, come on. - We should keep driving. - No, no, no, I know, but there's got to be something. A first aid kit, water. - Dad, I'll be okay. - I know. - No, we should go. - Honey, I know. I got to find something to fix you up first. Do you understand? Okay, Norah, I want you to hold this - and to stay close, all right? - Okay. - And be careful. - Okay. One, two, three. Okay. There you go. Go, go, go. - Stop. - No, no, no, no. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. Okay. Keep going, honey. Keep going. Come on. - All right? - Yeah. Hello? Is anybody here? Dad, what is this place? Some kind of poachers' lodge. Poachers like that we saw last night? No. Yes, but they're not gonna come here, okay? - Okay. - All right, put that down. Hey. All right, Mare. I want you to breathe, all right? I'm gonna take a look at it. - Okay. - How does it feel? - It hurts. - Hurts? Yeah. - Bad. - Okay. I'm gonna need to find something to dress that, okay? Okay. Dad, it smells really bad in here. Yeah, I know. All right. Um... - Hang on. - Mare, we're gonna be okay, okay? - We need to find, like, a medical box... - It's okay. I'll be right back. We're gonna bring something. - ...or something, okay? - Okay. - Okay. - Come on, Norah. Keep your eyes out. Something that looks like, uh, gauze, all right? Go look over there. You see anything? - No. - No? All right. Okay. - Oh, my goodness. - Come on. Come on. God, I hate these poachers. - You see anything? - No. Nothing? Oh. Hey. Uh... - Hey, Norah. - Yeah? - Uh, put these on the table. - Okay. - Open them up. - Uh-huh. - Are you okay? - Mm-hmm. Hang on, Mare. Just keep breathing, okay? But it hurts. I-I know it really hurts, but... All right, Mare. You're up. This is gonna hurt a little bit, okay? I want you to just be brave. All right, I'm gonna wash my hands and pour a little alcohol on it. All right, watch your hand now. All right. Okay, it's gonna hurt. All right? Get that ready for me. It's okay. I know. I know. - I got to get it right in there. - It's okay. - Okay. - How's it look? Well, it's an animal wound, so it's prone to infection, okay? But the laceration goes deep, but it doesn't seem to touch any organs. All right? - Where's the other one? - I feel... I feel sick, Dad. You feel sick? Yeah. The nausea, that's from the dehydration and the blood loss, all right? But, hey, listen. Guess what. You're gonna be better. Bought ourselves some time, okay? - All right? - Okay. I think you're gonna be okay. All right? For now. For now? What? Okay, I'm playing. I'm playing. All right, girls, listen, I'm gonna go look around and see if I can find some water. I need you to stay here, all right? - No, Dad. What? No. - Hey, no, no, no. I need you to look after your sister, okay? Can you do that? She's got me, Dad. All right. - I'll be right back. - Hurry up, Dad. We're gonna be out of here. It's okay, Mare. Just hold my hand. - Okay? - This looks bad. Mare. Mare. Come on, come on. H-Hey, um, can anybody hear me? - You got to get down. - I can't. Mare, you have to get down. Mare. Mare, get down. Dad! Girls, stay down! Stay down! Stay down! Hey, girls. You okay? All right, come on. Come on. We got to get out of here. - Wait, Dad, the gun. - No, gun's empty. Just go that way. Go. Okay. All right. Come on. Come on. Let's go. All right. Watch the steps, okay? How did he find us here, Dad? I don't know. He must've cut through the mountains. Here you go. No, you're not gonna make it? You want me to pick you up? - All right. Come on. Come on. - It hurts. One, two, three. There you go. All right. Uh, just go through that door right there. Okay? Go ahead. Go ahead. Let's get you in here. This will keep you safe. Let's get in here. Good. All right. - Sit right here, okay? - Okay. - All right? - Okay. Dad, what are you doing? He's not gonna stop. You guys are gonna stay here. - Dad, what are you talking about? - No, no, no. - No. - If we stay together, we're not gonna make it, all right? - Dad! No. - I-I need you to trust... - Dad, no! - Hey, I need you to trust me right now. I know what I'm doing. I promise. Trust me. - Okay. Okay. - Okay? Okay? - Hey. Hey. - Okay. Yeah. Now, I want you to keep this gate closed. Do you understand? Wait, Dad. I love you, okay? Please... And I love you, too, okay? I love you. - Love you. - Love you, Dad. Okay. Stay here. Wait, Dad. It's back. - Hey! - Dad, be careful. Hey! Come on. Come on. You can't have them. No. Come get me. Come on! That's it. Come on. Come on. Follow me! Hey! Come on. Get the trank rifles! Get the lions away from him right now. Mr. Nate, it's Banji. Where are the girls? Where's my love? Where are you? I'm so glad I found you. Everything is gonna... ...be okay. Dad. Dad? Be careful. Okay, Dad. Please be careful. Baby, are you okay? I'm okay. - Norah, you guys are okay? - Yes. Yes. - Yeah. - What happened? Well, Banji came along with some reserve wardens, - and they found us. - Banji? Mm-hmm. I knew I liked that boy. You led that thing into their pride land. Rules of the jungle. You knew that the other lions would kill him to protect their pride. I was just trying to save my girls. I love you so much. I love you, too. Uncle Martin would be proud of you. He would have been proud of you, too. We get to go home soon. Maybe we should come back for another vacation with the lion. - Did it make it? The lion? - It... No, Dad. No, I mean... No, he-he messed me up. But we made it out alive. Yes, we did. Mare, you got this? - Yes.
