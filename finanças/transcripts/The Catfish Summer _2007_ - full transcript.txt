-Where's Ho Chi Minh? -Boss not here, I take key. Sign here. Not to be sentimental, but stuff is missing every year. Last year it was nine, I repeat, nine teaspoons. And that pisses me off! If it happens again, I'll come down on you like Rambo, got it? -Rambo? -Yep. This is your signature? Is it an incantation? I'd know if it was. Don't laugh so much. You'll get no discount. Because of the likes of you, I'll be rotting in hell for six months. Have a great crossing. It's a great travel agency, so enjoy! Petržalka our prefab hell Getting drunk is what we do so well I only wear the coolest gear My bed's warm when a chick is there Hey, you prick! If I don't pay attention to the TV I think things are happening to me Working makes me feel like a geek The same food every day of the week Hey, you prick! Hey, you prick! Hey, you prick! I didn't mean you! It's just a song… Trabants vanished like the Škoda MB Mercedes and Mazda are now all I see Smugglers exchange Indians for goods Taking trails marked out by hoods -Hey, you prick! -Hey, you prick! -Hey, you prick! -Get back here! Kuchar Consulting, may I help you? Excuse me? Try speaking slowly and clearly so I can hear you. Oh, it's you Kristyna… What? Talk quick, I don't have time. I'm working. People keep calling me. What? Sorry, other line… Well, what do you want? What? Someone called, okay? I have work to do, deals to make. What? I can't hear you. There's no signal. I'll be at the lake soon. What? She ran away? Who ran away? I can't hear you, Kristyna. There's no signal. The lines are disappearing: one, two, three… No signal. Don't be surprised I can't hear shit when there's no signal. ANGEL'S LAKE RECREATION CENTER -We've got mice, sir. -My mood is important to me, Kamil. -Don't put me in a bad one. -You don't understand. Some fucking mice gnawed the cables and the tap is electrified. It sparks in several places. We have to eliminate the symptom. -The symptom? -The symptom! You got smart over winter, Kamil. Did you get cable TV? No, I mean the reason why we can't get here in winter… I understand. Go get old Vrtilek to come isolate the symptom. Tell him not to worry, we'll work things out. Are you sure, sir? This might eventuate in… "Eventuate"? Good dog, Pepi, good dog! Sir! Sir! -Sir! Mr. Vrtilek said no. Run! -What? -What'd you tell him? -That you'd come see him about the electricity. But he said he won't jump when a murderer whistles. And he called you a fucking asshole and a little Prague orc. So I called him what you usually do: commie asshole. I'm not sure how to respond to that, Kamil. God damn it! God, what's he doing? Is that dog still after us? Sir! Sir! Jarda, sir! God damn it! Ouch! No biting! No biting! Oh, lord… Stupid drooling mutt! That stupid bastard doesn't even know he's stupid. Like owner, like dog. And he wrecked havoc on your face. You know, Kamil, I was in shock. I don't even know how I got in the car. Ask me why I ran with you. Okay? Ask me, Kamil. Ask me why I ran with you, why I went through that whole nightmare. -Go ahead and ask me. -Why? So you wouldn't be alone, you dick. Yeah, yeah, yeah. -Hey, guys! -Hi. -You're late. Hi, Jarda. Hi, Kamil. Damn, you got a brand-new ride, eh? We met old Vrtilek on the way. Man, he looked steamed. -Yeah, and? -He says you hurt his dog and he's gonna thrash you. You're skating on thin ice, Petr. And it's June! You don't want your best customer to take his business elsewhere?! Where would we get supplies, sir? They find everything VAT free. This battle of wits, Kamil, has no winners, you know. -Right, you bimbo? -Right… Come on, Jarda! Be a little generous. -That dog is all that old Vrtilek has. -So what? -He can't even catch fish like he used to. -That's his problem. Let's hurry and put it in back before it starts pouring. Think I don't know what's going on? I know very well! This city slicker doesn't have the balls to stand up to an old fart and have it out man to man. Kamil, you disappoint me. I remember a time when you didn't like being humiliated. The juice is leaking and it needs to be grounded. When it snows shit! It's you who deserves to be grounded! You already killed one innocent animal and I won't let it happen again. There are laws against electrifying dogs! -Come on, Pepa… -Screw you! Jarda has no one else but Kamil. And you sicked your dog on Kamil anyway. I sent Kamil with an offer, and I was even willing to pay. For every swine, there's water boiling… Remember that! You ought to be ashamed, Kamil. You sweaty rat! Let's tap a keg, guys. Come on… Peace at last. I'll have one from Kamil. I've been waiting all winter. It's beautiful here. Thanks. Jirka went to… comb his hair. -And who are you? -What? Mr. Zacharias, you know Mr. Kuchar, right? Ah, Kuchar (Cook)… I've known many… That's right, Mr. Zacharias. Mr. Kuchar has to pay royalties to the actors. You don't think he dubbed it himself, do you? That bastard is watching! Look at him. You ought to be ashamed, Vrtilek! I can see you! Screw it, Jarda. It's a really good movie. -I won't just screw it. -Sit and have a beer like a European. He won't fix the tap, but he'll watch my porn, The Wet Get-Together, and for free! Or "gratis" as Kamil would say. Eventually. Eh, Kamil? Oh, I missed. -That's okay. -Thanks. Oh, man… Well, well… You wouldn't believe what those creeps are watching. Impossible! What a configuration! Man, she's gonna dislocate her hip. It ain't worth shit without love, right? Piss off! But these perverts will never understand. Here. Have a look. Can you believe it? Oh, man… Good dog, Pepi, good dog… Tourists? Tourists… You may as well have brought the globe. I aged three hours for this? -Whatever! -No, not for this. It's missing quadrant H8. It must be a printing error. Tourists! Guten Tag! Come on, we're open! Welcome to Angel's Lake! Truly a divine place. You can recharge yourselves for the whole year. Kamil! You know what employees are like. What'll it be? Coffee, cola, juice? Or something stronger? -Water, if anything. -No problem. We're trying to find Camp Solstice, located in quadrant H8. -H8? I think you turned wrong… -No, you turned right! We're smaller, but you'll have the lake to yourselves. You and your wife. Is she your wife? It doesn't matter… I'm not judging… It's divinely quiet here. Nothing will happen to you. Camp Solstice is packed, and you seem to be a decent kind of guy… And who'd want to swim in their piss water? Our water's clean. You can drink it. But then again, who would? Coffee is better. -I'd like a cup! -No problem, ma'am. -But, Marta… -I'm staying. 15 years with you, Bohdan, and I learned to count every second. I came for the water and there's plenty of it here. And it's clean. Milk and sugar? But we agreed to go to a lake near Chocholov Chapel. The place where the ghost of the knight Bartholomew appeared. You're a clever one, eh, doc? I'm writing about legends, but I used to be an anthropologist. -A what? -An anthropologist. You'll get along with Kamil then. He likes being smart too. Right, Kamil? "Eventuate"… There's no milk. -You must be a real saint. -Yeah, but with a devil inside. -What? -Nothing. Oh, I stopped doing those things. I'm just a loner… right Kamil?! -How's the tanning here? -Here? Wonderful. -I'd like to lie out somewhere. -Lie out? Right over there is a beautiful place. -There? -It's hot all day, right, Kamil? Well, Professor, coffee? Milk and sugar? We have interesting legends in this area too, right, Kamil? Yeah, like the one about "The decent coffee"… I'll be right there, Kamil. Good luck. If it keeps going like this we'll be just fine. Ties are for shit. Look at that hussy. A kilo of fat looks pretty good with a nipple on it, eh? Ever had a girl, Kamil? Yeah, sure. I don't mean those perfumed video whores. I mean a real, pretty, sweaty chick with a hot chassis. You'll laugh, sir, but I'm waiting for the right one. Right one, left one… Forward march! And before you get there, your car and house will be gone. And all that's left is three grand in monthly alimony. Remember that swing that soared way out into the lake? Damn! My head almost hurts from nostalgia. Where is she? Where is she? The usual. The usual! -Hold the map! -Leave me alone! -Take it! Look at the map! -Watch out you don't fall in! Marta, why do you humiliate me? What do you get out of it? Let's act like people, not like pillaging Swedes. It's me, your best friend from college. Your husband, Bohdan. After 15 years of marriage, who would use this as an argument? I'm not interested in your legends. When did we last make love normally? Without historical masks? Look, there's old Vrtilek. He's pissed you sent them to his turf. Kuchar! Yep… Every swine will get what's coming to them… Right, Pepi? We're off. -We'll be back for the movie. -Later, guys! Why did you say I was just an employee when it's not true? So they'll tip you. As an employee. Ask me why I don't use my PhD. title on my ID. I wouldn't get shit if they knew I had a title like they do. Anthropologists are wired differently. Did I give you those new shoes I have for you? They're in the car. They're really cool. You won't need these anymore. We're cut from the same cloth, Kamil. Sewn for success. Alright, alright… What was that? I can see you, Vrtilek! See that? A masterful cast. See that? He almost crippled me! This is my water! And Kamil's! You could've killed me! This is my water! Better knock it off, you scoundrel! Shit! Oh, well. Next time, right, Pepi? Marta! Marta! That's not right… Fucking hell! Goddammit! Screw it! Hello. -Big shock, eh? -No, I just… -Maybe coffee would hurt less. -Sure, but it tastes awful. Try sparking me up a coffee, and a pack of smokes, too. Kamil, you've finally gone crackers. Now I'll have to go it alone. Great! Hi, Dad. Where's your mom? -Why are you here? -I haven't see you for so long. I awoke one morning and said: time to see my biological father. -What? What?! -So I'm here. And I figured I could stay with you for the summer. Come here. Come on. Come here. Sit down. Stay with me? Sure, for the summer. Don't you know about it? I know everything. Your mom called me. -So you know about it. -I don't know anything. I do… -Just tell me what you're hiding. -What should I say? -I'll find out anyway. -I'm not hiding anything. -So then you need money. -Yeah, for another abortion. So you want money. -Why didn't you call at least? -There's no signal here. According to the latest maps, this place doesn't even exist. No one will find it except by pure chance. Is there still that swing that soared way out into the lake? No. -Can I stay? -I don't know. Maybe Kamil and I can sleep here and you can have the hut. -Thanks, Dad! I'm going for a swim. -Don't go far and watch out for snakes! What, Kamil? Let's get to work. Did you see that chicky? What a babe! Jirka's socks were pumping like the tractor pistons. Watch out, that's Jarda's daughter. Aha, so we'll be back this evening. Hello. Hello, hello… -Hello, hello! -Hello… Hey there, doggy. What a beauty you are! -Sorry I don't have a treat for you. -He already ate, so he'd just barf. -How old are you? -I'll be 60 come All Souls' Day. And he'll be three, that's 21 for you and me. That is, if that cutthroat Kuchar doesn't turn him into goulash. The man at the snack bar? I thought he was a nice guy. Nice? I've had enough of him. He's a proven dog killer. He ran over Karlik, but he won't get Pepi. Over my dead body. They should have locked him up ages ago. A local named Kamil works there, he's a simpleton. But like I say: there's water boiling for every swine! -Right, Pepi? -Good luck fishing. Bye, Pepi. Wouldn't it be great to catch him at our age? Pepi! Did you see that? The usual! -What's going on? -It's Sunday… We thought we'd check out the church. Cut the crap, Petr. What the hell are you talking about? Man, the only place you go is out to drink and watch porn. Sorry Jarda, but that's your view on the matter… "My view", huh? Kamil, come and tell them how I see it! Are all three of you gone completely mental? This isn't some drunk dingbat of a milkmaid who'll roll in the hay with you after one shot. This is a decent girl! This is my daughter! So, Jarda, are you trying to say she's "off-limits"? -Yes. -Yes. -Evening. -Evening! -I'm Pavla. -Petr. That's Jirka. -Pavla. -Hey, hey, hey! My dad hasn't seen me in 3 years so he's a little on edge. Kamil, two Monhottan's and anything Mr. Kuchar and his girl would like. -Come on. -They call you mister? -I said come on! Not "Monhotton's" but "Manhattan's" and I'll buy the young lady a drink! Whatever you say, Kamil! If you want to hide out here then play by my rules. -Like what? -Tractor drivers stay by the tractor and Kamil stays by the tap. And without a tux! -What about you, mister? -You're asking for it! If you want to be here, then you have to be cool. Maybe I could stay at your place in Prague. In Prague? I have bugs. They're exterminating. -Roaches as big as rats. -Excuse me, where's the snack bar? -Got any money today? -Of course I do! What business is it of yours? Who are you anyway? I don't know you. -Do you get along with the locals? -Why? You weren't born here, you're gone all winter… We get along just fine. Who else would run a snack bar? Only a psycho would serve beer here. I hope the beer is cold! It's just that I met a man who was pretty mad at you. I'm sure it was old Vrtilek. We get along great: I ran over his dog. Three years ago. -How? -It was an accident. I was backing up and the mutt ran in the way. I don't really know… That's rich. Well, maybe I'll have better luck next time. We'll see who'll be a legend. We'll get him next time, friend. Pepi! Pepi! Come, boy! My God, Pepi! Pepi, my friend! Where are you? Pepi! Pepi! Seriously, why did you take off from your mom's? Because of Viki. She doesn't like him. -She like doesn't your boyfriend? -She didn't get to know him. Why not? -Because he's in jail. -You've got to be kidding. Don't worry, just till the end of summer. Great, a con in the family. Pepi… Pepi… Somebody pause it! Mr. Vrtilek, are you okay? Try slapping him. That should wake him up. -No, really, Jarda. He doesn't have a pulse. -No way. He might not walk this off. Let's get him on a table. -He's dead, isn't he? -Nonsense! Hey, Marta, come look. Fireworks! I'll give you fireworks! And your breath stinks too. Lojza is back. -Lojza who? -Impossible, it's been 20 years. He's back. And he ate my Pepi. I saw it! Who's Lojza? Can someone tell me what this Lojza is all about? -Who? -All of a sudden there's some Lojza. Don't know him. -Oh, Lojza! That monster catfish! -Pepi, my darling… Something similar happened 20 years ago. Yep, Lojza, the monster catfish. He's a local legend that everyone thought died long ago. Everyone said his mouth was as big as a tractor tire. A giant catfish? Maybe someone would like to try and catch it. Back then, dozens of fishermen came from all over to catch him. Dozens of fishermen? THE FORTUNATE FISHERMAN Dozens have tried to catch him. Kamil, you still got the shoes I gave you? Can it, gramps! Evening, this is Kamil Hospes. There's a monster catfish at Angel's Lake. We invite all fishermen to help us catch this fish. Refreshments will be provided by the Tropicana snack bar. That's all. We invite all fishermen to help us catch this fish. I'll help you. I'll handle this one myself. Ups-a-daisy! And where is it? Ah, there it is… THE FORTUNATE FISHERMAN -Where are your gloves? -No sparks anymore since it blew up yesterday. Kamil will be happy as a clam. What are you drinking? Are you 17 yet? Five years ago. This is only for big girls. Right, Kamil? Do you remember coming camping here when you were little? You were so afraid of the water. Remember? -And you promised me a dog if I went in. -Yeah. -You never bought me one. -Yeah… Even though I went in. What about Viki? What did he do? He accidentally hit a cop. What was he thinking? He's just really spontaneous. Did you dial the right number, Kamil? -I'm not an idiot. -That's why I'm asking. -Hey, guys! What a night, eh? -Poor Vrtilek! First you, then the fish… He won't survive another dog. Who cares? He's crazy. -You saved his life, you know. -Yep… I panicked. This is for Pepi! For Pepi! -No! He's lost his mind! -Run, Marta! -Get the pin! -Let me go! Let me go, you swine! God damn it! Stick the pin back in or it's going to blow! -You can't just tie him up. -Can't? We have to! He's crazy. He almost blew everything sky high. Where would you go then? Guys, I'm for business, legal or illegal, but this is too much. A dozen of them? He just wanted to be sure. His only dog… Imagine if Lojza had sucked up Kamil. At least remove the gag. Only of he swears on his dead mutt to stop this bullshit. Mr. Vrtilek, if you promise to stop this bullshit I'll give you a drink. Okay, Pepa, agreed? Fuck you! -Hey, dickheads! -Hey, dickheads! We're here for that freshwater asshole: that giant catfish you got here. -I'm Zdenda and this is my son Jan. -I'm Jan. It's the biggest catfish in Bohemia. It ate a dog whole. Butt out, dammit. -Coffee, or something stronger? -I don't drink. It thins the sperm. My sperm are fine. I'll be back tonight. Don't you dare. I want to be a grandfather. Listen, guys, people have been trying to catch Lojza for years. That's good. We wouldn't be here otherwise. -Anything else? -No. Well, fuck me! Why do I get all the freaks? I'm cursed. TODAY'S MENU: BEER Sir, they… You forgot to search his pockets, didn't you? We have to find him, you idiots, before he finds trouble. Forget about him. My brother has the grenades. -What else did you sell him? -Nothing much. -Which weight should I use? -The heaviest, to cast farthest. That scamp will be in the middle of the lake. But with no dick, he's no rival. Know who said that? I did. Put two on so it'll fly. And get the camera, I'm about to cast. Well, well… Oh, yes! Oh, yes! What do we have here? Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Wow… No pictures! Get the rod. The sun is going fast. Move! Now, now take a picture. Now! THE FORTUNATE FISHERMAN -Got it in focus? -Yep. Mr. Vrtilek? Mr. Vrtilek? Mr. Vrtilek, where are you? I'll pretend I don't know you're taking a picture. Take it! Marta! Did you see that? Damn, I think I lost my suit. -That was my last suit. -It looked like your first. Dad! Help me! Help! -Mr. Vrtilek! Daddy! -For Pepi! I'll kill that bastard! I'll kill him and myself too! I'll kill you too! -Bastard! -Get it away from him! Vrtilek, you ass! You're gonna kill us! You can't stop me! I'll kill you all! -Stop or I'm turning you in! -Go ahead! -Shut up, Vrtilek! -I'll kill you all! -He bit me! You can't stop death! I'm gonna kill that bastard and eat him! -He's nuts. -He'll need some food. -Maybe just some chips. -How about… Pepi? Give him a sausage and maybe he'll shut up. And now I've got to feed the old guy! I'll kill you all! -I'll kill him and eat him! -Mr. Vrtilek? It's with mayo. Then I'll shit him and then I'll eat him again! Who's the manager here? -Do you have any swim trunks? -Swim trunks? No, we don't. I'll kill him and eat him! Then I'll shit him and eat him… Is that the guy who was throwing grenades? No, they took him away. Want a beer or a shot, Professor? -The professor came for a swimsuit. -Swimsuit? No problem. Have a beer and I'll get someone right on it. I'll eat him! Then I'll shit him! Then I'll eat him! We've got this local song. It's about excretion. Kamil, beer! -So, a swimming suit? -I know it! -I'll eat him and shit him out… -What about suits, boys? A specific model, or will you leave it to us? Look at her slippers! Looks like our unpaid vacation is paying off double. What do you envision, Professor? Snug in front? Size doesn't matter, right, Jirka? I think maybe I should have a little look around. -Oh, good afternoon! -Oh! Good afternoon. I didn't see you. Good afternoon, or evening, rather. -Good night! -No, come on over. -But I can only just hop by, as they say. -Hop, hop! I'm just fishing nearby and it's my habit to always get to know my neighbors. It's supposed to be good luck. I mean, in fisherman's jargon… Are you on vacation? Depends how you take it. I take it easy. Come and sit. You're making me nervous. -Well… Well… -Heavens, and a bottle! Is that for a water sprite or for me? -It's for you… and the sprite. -How nice of you. Come and sit. Careful. I wouldn't want anything to happen. -It's stable. -Oh, do you think so? -Jarda, turn it up! -What? -The news. Turn it up. In apartment 18 of this building, police detained an amazing 130 refugees - men, women and children. This Vietnamese mafia base has long been under surveillance. Apartment owner Jarda K., a Czech citizen now on the run, -is wanted for criminal conspiracy… -It's enough to make you sick. Let's turn on some porn. No one's gonna get off on this. -I'm going. If Marta knew… -Right. -I'm off. So it's agreed? -Sure, no problem. Goodbye. -Beautiful here, isn't it? -We've agreed on that. -Zdenda? -What? -Hey, a dog! No, it's a deer! -Zdenda… Have you seen a redhead? Forty years old, not very tall? -Was she missing a shoe? -How do you know? Because the other one is in your hand. Sorry, I haven't seen her. -What's all the lead for? -For catching the giant catfish. No one's caught him in ten years. He's a local legend. -Wanna try? -I don't know… You need the proper stance, the perfect drag, and, above all, good wrist action. Release the line about three-quarters of the way through. Try it. It's like sticking your finger into a young girl. I haven't tried this in a long time. There, I did it. Now I have to go. Marta! Marta! Even a master can slip up… -You smoke, sir? -What? Just sometimes, when the mood strikes me. Sit by me, Pavla. About my apartment… No problem. What can you do if you're exterminating? That's all nonsense. But if anything happens to me, the place is yours. -What's going to happen to you? -Nothing's going to happen to me. But I rent my place to a group that isn't strictly kosher. They're hiding Vietnamese there, those refugees… And the police don't like it. I was on TV today. So I'm kind of screwed. Looks like I won't play this hand out. Do you think the snack bar makes a profit? In this hellhole? No way! -I've got to find something else. -Sure. -Hey, that's pretty cool. -What? -You'll be able to get to know Viki. -Why? They might throw you in jail for smuggling. Man, I'm a born loser. Son of a bitch! Almost! Missed by a hair! Where have you been? Mind your own business. Where were you? -What's with your head? -It's your fault, you were gone! There you are! Two of your weights ripped off. I found them. Into the catfish's lair, I hope to see you there! And no pricks are going to do it for us! -Dad, shouldn't I do it? -I'll pretend I didn't hear that. -Look! Did you hear that? -Eh? -Did you hear that? Look, look, it's coming! Come on, come on, come on… Come, little catfish, come. We're here to bring you home! Look… Look! You'll like this… Look what I've got, you hunk! Good evening! Take it, you bastard! You bastard! -Pavla? Smile… -It'll be dark without flash. It won't. -Can I get something a bit stronger? -Hide it! Are you dense? Absolutely, Professor, absolutely. We're here to bring you home! Just don't die on me! Okay, guys… I hear there's some mythical beast floating around here. What's the truth, fellas? Miss? I saw this documentary on TV. They caught this certain animal using the bait it liked best. Gimme a shot. I can't believe it. The bait it liked best, eh? I guess I have to cancel my Monday "meeting" with Blanka from accounting. Thanks for the tip, Professor. Marta… Guys… What? Wait! Get back here! Where are you going? Stop gawking and row! Get back here, you son of a bitch! It's 8 o'clock, wait till 12! One of us will be crying and it won't be me, got it? It won't be me! Who do you think you are? Guess what I think of you? Not much, sir, not much! A guy who can't even guard his own swimsuit ain't a man. -Come on, Jan, yell! -No, he ain't! -Say "ain't a man," dammit! -Ain't a man! -Ain't a man! -Who do you think you are? Sleep with women, sure, but do it decently, sir, decently! How about some decency from you? How about it? -No, sir, how about some decency from you? -How about some decency? You don't seem very decent to me! I feel sorry for your son, sir! I'll give you sorry, you idiot! Nice, that was nice… Come on, come on! You're going after Pepi, bastard! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! -Let me go! -I said we're going! Stop trying to fight it! -I'm not going anywhere! -Get in your cage! -What quadrant are we going to now? -Hands off the wheel! And fly! -What the hell are you doing? -What? -That's my catfish! -Don't be so greedy! -Beat it! See how well you flew, pup? Now swim! -Good God! -The fish? Take it, take it! What a catch! I'll be on the cover! Come on, take it! Here, this way! The fish is on the other side, you idiot! Swim the other way! I caught the dog killer! For every swine, there's water boiling… Mr. Vrtilek! -Take it, take it, take it! -I am! Take it! I'm the biggest! I'm the king! -Take it! -I am! God damn it, Vrtilek, get back here with my rod! -Come get it, asshole! -We're through, got it? -What should we do? -I dunno. Shout hurrah! -Hurrah… -Forget that! Come help me! Come on, Kamil! Get over here, you oaf! Give me that fish! -Lojza is mine, you assholes! -Kamil! Well, Jarda, where is it? Hitch me to your tractor and I'll give you a grand! I'll give you two! -I'll make it three! -Four! I'll give my whole pension and my bike to boot! -I'll take it! -What are you looking at? History is being made! Red hair is a sign of degeneration. I will be on the cover! Right, left, like I taught you! -What was that for? -I'm tired of your deals. I'll eat him, I'll shit him! Dad? All this because of a woman? You aren't my son! Come on out, you swine! How could you do it to me? I've never been so close to anything! -Mr. Vrtilek? -Pepa? -Pretty good joke. -Pretty wild. Dad? I'm over here. Again! Hello. Is this the Tropicana snack bar? We're looking for Jarda Kuchar. We have a warrant for his arrest. -Are you him? -No, I'm the waiter here. Any fish in the lake? -I'm Josef Vrtilek. -Sergeant Srnka… Mr. Kuchar lost his mind and blew himself up. Suicide. -Dad… -This is his daughter. Poor thing will end up in therapy. Guys, move your car or it's going to blow up too. Yep, old Kuchar was always a psycho. -Yeah, a madman! -He was nuts. I heard you found some refugees hiding in his apartment. -That's why we're here. -I heard about it on TV. -You've got body rot. -What? -Should do something about it. If she don't give, you don't get any! Who said that? You did. You're making progress! Come on, young buck! Did I ever tell you about Iveta? The one from the library?
