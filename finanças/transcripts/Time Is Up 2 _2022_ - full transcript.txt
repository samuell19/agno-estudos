Let me take that. No way, I already told you, I can carry my one bag. Sorry I dragged you all the way out here. Give me a couple of days. I'll take care of things, and we go back home, okay? I'm actually really happy I came out with you. That's nice to be out of the city and unplug and be in a place where time has kind of stopped. Time passes in its own way out here. Nothing has changed since I was a kid. Oh my goodness. Not even the goats? They're so cute! Ah! Yeah, they used to drive me nuts when I was a kid. That is awesome. I bet you were such a cute kid. Yeah, I was crazy. Like a tornado. Well, I guess, not much has changed. Yeah, so you better not mess with me. Hey! Good, my shoulder hurts anyway. Hey! Hello! Welcome! Vivien! - So nice to meet you! - So nice to meet you, finally! - So good to see you. - Oh, good to see you! Come in, come in! Lunch is ready! - You must be starving! - Yeah. - What? Really? - Yeah. I like so much here. - Oh. Here you are. - This house is so beautiful. Oh. Thank you. May I introduce you to Roy's other aunt? - Concetta. - Vivien. They don't speak English very well, be patient. So. Uhm. Are you guys engaged? Why don't you tell her? So what did he say? Oh, it's a secret. No fair, secrets don't make friends. Mmm. No, they don't. Uh, Roy. Did you go see the farmhouse? Not yet. Oh, it's in bad shape. Every time I go there, I get mad. It's best for everyone if we sell it. How's school going? It's over. I lost my scholarship. What happened? I got it because I was on the swim team. And I'm not on the team anymore. Couldn't you find a job and pay for it? You could work with your dad at the garage. College is too expensive. That's why I wanna sell the farmhouse, so I can pay the tuition fees. Whatever you want, Roy. Grandma left it to you. What happened here? There was a fire. It spread to the house and destroyed it. How old is this place? It's been in the family for generations. I'm actually a bit sad about selling it. So many memories. You grew up here. Yeah, and I chose to leave. Uhm Hey! You made it. Are you okay? Yeah. - What are you? - Oh - Are you an object? - Yeah. Oh! This is my favorite. Okay, uhm Can I use you? Yes, you can. Okay. Uhm Can Does everyone use you? - A lot of people, not everyone. - Are you a household appliance? - Not only. - Are you a kitchen appliance? No. You're not a hose, are you? Are you colorful? Come on Hello? Hey! I'm so sorry, I don't speak Italian. Do you speak English? Yeah, I Uhm I didn't mean to scare you. - Get up here. - Thank you. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Fine. Uh That is very heavy. How do you ride this thing? Haven't you seen my muscles? I'm Vivien. Hi. Anna, nice to meet you. That actually does look kind of bad. - Yeah. - Yeah. Let's get you inside and We'll clean that up so that doesn't get infected. I'm fine, really, I don't I don't wanna bother you. No! Do not be ridiculous, come on! - Are you sure? - Yes, of course! Your English is so good! I I studied in America for a while. What are we doing here? Come with me! I'm sorry Sir, there's nothing I can do, that reservation was definitely canceled. Oh God Hey. Did something happen? Yeah, one of the artists can't come. It's a major disaster. He supposed to check in this morning, he didn't show up and now the whole show is falling apart. I'm so sorry. -Love, this is -Roy, right? Yes. Roy, I couldn't wait for you to get here. I'm Thomas. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Oh I'm so sorry, I have to go and take care of this mess. - I'm so sorry. - It's okay. Go fix it. Love you. Love you too. So where did he come from? I met him in London at an exhibition. And Vivien's been putting up with you for what Six months? Give or take. She ain't exactly low maintenance either. So you're made for each other. Well This was your mother's. We used to dream about meeting our true loves, getting married and Vivien I have a feeling she can't wait to get a ring on her finger. So - Thank you. - Oh Don't make me cry. Hey listen, I used up my film. Is there anywhere I can develop it? Sure! Thomas has a dark room at the gallery, let's go! Thank you, you saved me. No, trust me, you saved me. My uhm My boyfriend and I came to visit his relatives and It's just really not been easy to find someone to talk to. Yeah, I'm sorry, it's A lot of Italians don't speak great English. Yeah, but you're pretty fluent. Where did you go to school? Oh, this place in In New Jersey. New Jersey, really? That's where we're from. - So, do you study Medicine? - Ah No. Physics. That's really cool. It always fascinated me, but I never thought I could understand it. So How do you manage it while you're here? I don't. Uhm, but I'll go back really soon And I'm so excited because my school got me this internship with a big company. - So, I'm happy! - Yeah, sounds cool. - What do you do? - Oh I I do a bunch of things. Right now I'm here for the vendemmia. The grape - Harvest. - Oh, cool. And it starts tomorrow, you really really have to come. I can't tomorrow. I leave tomorrow morning. You know, I've got an idea - You're coming with me. - What? Oh, it's your last day here and you can't spend it cooped up in here all alone. So, do you like it? Oh "I like it" is an understatement. It's beautiful. Good, I'm happy. It's one of my favorite places. - It's just so nice to just walk. - Yeah. Thinking So serene It is, it's quiet. No people. - Yeah. - Just the two of us. What are you doing? I'm gonna go for a swim. - What? - Yeah. You're gonna go swimming right now Isn't it like too cold? Oh, it's never too cold in Sicily, believe me. The water is great! Oh my Goodness, it's gonna be so cold! Oh, I'm good about that! Oh yes! Freedom! This is, honestly, breathtaking. I told you. I knew you were gonna love it. Uh How did that happen? - Uhm Shark attack. - What? Oh, you had me. You had me! I got burned when I was a kid. And I guess you really shouldn't play with fire. Well I think scars are kind of really beautiful. They like tell a person's story. Well, maybe one day I'll tell you mine. - Deal. - Yeah. I have to tell you, I think your boyfriend is a really lucky man. Have you guys been together for a long time? No. But Roy was there for me in like, a really bad time in my life. Uhm And so I feel like I don't know, like he knows who I am. Yeah. What about you? Do you have someone special enough to appreciate all this beauty? Actually Yeah, I do. His name is Tony and I've I've known him for a really really long time and It's just that I think you never really know people. Where were you? I called you all afternoon. Uhm I made a friend. The reception was bad and then my battery died. This is Anna, by the way. Nice to meet you. Vivien told me so much about you. You had me so fucking worried. I'm sorry, baby. I thought you were going to be back way later. And then Anna showed me this amazing place, so beautiful. Yeah. I really have to go, so I hope I'll get to see you again. Yeah? - Yes, very nice to meet you! - Yeah, for me too! Bye! - Bye! - Bye bye! Who was that? Mm? I told you, this girl I met today. Uhm, she fell off her motorcycle and I helped her out. Then she took you on some sort of adventure just because she liked you? Yeah. I'm sorry, are you like, jealous or What's happening here? No, I'm just curious. Okay. Are you packed? Yeah, I have a couple of things left to grab. Okay, we should hurry up. We're leaving at the crack of dawn tomorrow. Oh my God! What happened? A volcano erupted and they canceled all the flights. I guess you already know. Our volcano is a female. Unpredictable and restless. We need to get the hell out of here. But they don't know when the flights are gonna resume. You're not stuck here forever. You can make it a vacation. I could use some extra hands. - What for? - What do you mean "what for"? The grape harvest! You guys can help! A grape harvest doesn't sound that bad. I've never been. It's so annoying. No need to run! This is my boyfriend Tony. - Hi! - Hi! - Vivien. Nice to meet you! - Nice to meet you. He's a singer. Do you play the guitar? I can drink wine also. Yeah! That's a great answer! Yeah. - I like that. - Just need a bit of red courage. Hey! You, wait there. Wait. That was fun. Yeah. Do you mean now or today? Both Yeah. Anna and Tony are so cute together. I guess. You don't like Anna, do you? I don't know, like She's always hanging around you, haven't you noticed? I mean We like each other, that's all. She showed up at the house when you were all alone. Out of the blue. Don't you think it's weird? No, I told you. She fell off her bike. Did you see her fall? No, but Why would she do that, like, who would fake that? She was bleeding. I don't know. I'm just telling you what I think, but I'm sorry if I upset you. No, I'm not upset. I just I just think she needs friends. You just met her. You never really know people. Roy? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, -twenty-one -You're amazing! Yes! - Hey, you two! - Hey, babe. - Good morning! - Good morning. Good morning, April. Hi. What's going on? The school called. They're moving up my internship. - When do you start? - A week. Don't worry. We'll be home by then. What if they don't reschedule the flight? Don't worry, we'll figure it out. Do you like it? Yes, looks like a sketch. It's all in the eye of the beholder. This artist has an amazing eye. You do too. That's why I called you. Now, the thing that really struck me about you, Roy, is there's something uneasy, you know? Something restless in your landscapes. Take a sit. Each shot conveys something different, and yet they all have something in common. Your gaze. I'm not sure what you're getting at. One of the artists just backed out the show I'm doing. I've been looking for a new talent. Somebody who's got something truly original to contribute. I was getting desperate because you know how hard that is to find on such short notice. And Laura brought me your photos. I'd like to show these if that's all right with you. Are you kidding me? That's amazing! I have to talk to Vivien but Yes, thank you so much! No, no. Thank you. So, I'll start working on this and I plan to see you tomorrow What time? Yeah, I can't wait to start. At 2:30pm? - Yeah. - Great. - Hey! - Hey! Thomas wants my photos! - What? - Yes! He wants to do a show in his art gallery! I'm so excited, I can't believe it! That's awesome! Congrats, baby! - When is the show? - I still don't know. Well We should probably figure that out, because I have to leave soon for my internship. What? What did I say? What's wrong? I thought you would be happy for me. Of course I'm happy for you I'm so happy for you! Yeah, so happy you can't wait to leave! Uh I have to actually get back, this is about my future. Do you still give a shit about my future? That's why we're here! For your future, that's why we came, so that you could sell the farmhouse and have money for school. What? I don't think school is the right path for me anymore. What? What are you talking about? Are you coming with me or not? Hi, uhm - Bad timing? - No No, not at all. - Guys! What are you up to today? - Nothing! Wonderful, then come with us, we're going for a walk. No, man. I don't feel like it. I'm not in the mood. I do! Sounds like a great idea. Great. Let's go. You're so quiet today, something wrong? Oh I have to go back to the States, but I think Roy wants to stay. You guys had a fight? It's more like I'm learning things about him that I didn't know before. Mm Well, I guess that's quite normal when a relationship starts to get more serious. Do you still trust him, right? Yeah. Hey, where are you going? Aren't we going to the top? Yeah but That way is way more difficult. It's way faster. I don't think so. It's not faster. Why don't we have a race? It's gonna be boys against girls - Race, race, race, race. - Okay. That's a stupid idea. Well, I think the boys are just scared that we're gonna kick their asses. Okay then. Remember, no running allowed. And I'll know if you cheat, so don't even try. All right, I'm gonna send you a postcard from there. - Yeah. I'll send you one too. - Signed it. Yeah. Is it gonna be like this the whole way? Pretty much. I need help. At the end of the month I'm doing a gig with my band in Catania. I would have invited you guys. Is that what you do? Are you a musician? Is that your thing? Yeah. After ten years of school. Yeah. But it's fine, it's my thing. What about you? Are you studying at school? I'm still looking for my thing. Anna! What are these trees called? They're so beautiful! Anna! Anna! Oh shit! Anna! Can anyone hear me? Your girlfriend seems amazing. Anna was telling me she studies incredible things. Yeah, she's very determined, and unlike me, she always knows what she wants. Anna is like that too. So, have you guys been together for a long time? We've known each other for years. But she never saw me that way. So what changed? A few weeks ago she came looking for me, and she suggested I go with her on this trip. So it hasn't been that long then. Like, you basically hooked up right before we got here. Yeah. Fuck! I'm sorry! Where's Vivien? I don't know, I turned around and she just wasn't there. Hey, hold on. Breathe! Tell us what happened. We got lost. Okay I I I don't know what happened, I turned around and I looked everywhere and I called her, and she just wasn't there. I felt the best thing that I could do was to come and tell you guys so we could look for her together. It was you, wasn't it? Why are you sayi... I should have never left her with you. It's all your fault! Dude! Calm down! Anna didn't do anything! Of course she did. It was her! I get it. You're afraid. But we have to go find her. Now. I think I lost her somewhere over there. You think or you're sure? I don't know, I think! I'm pretty sure, I don't know! Take this. I'm going alone, you guys go that way, just in case you got it wrong. Vivien! Vivien! Baby, baby wake up, wake up. Are you okay? - Yeah. - What happened? I Can you move your leg? Yeah. Okay. - What happened? - I Uh Ouch, okay, okay, thank you. Are you sure? Yeah, I don't know, I got lost. I was looking for Anna. Are you actually okay? I'm okay. I just miss home. - I don't need to do the show. - No, you should I miss our lives. I think it's time to go back. Today you really scared me. I almost lost you once. I won't let that happen again. Thomas just got here. I I think I better go and talk to him. It's gonna be hard to tell him I changed idea about doing the show. I'll see you at home, okay? Okay. Wow! So beautiful. Wait. Where is everyone? There's a flower festival in town. And they couldn't wait to go. And I couldn't wait to have some time alone with you. Oh, is this all for me? So did you this all by yourself? Nicola gave me a hand. To us. To our future together, and to going back home. Finally they opened up the flights again. To us! What's wrong? You can't pass up that show. But you need to get back home! What will you do? I don't know, I'll call the university, ask for an extension. I'll figure it out. Isn't it gonna be hard on you? They chose me, and Thomas chose you, and your photos are so beautiful. It's It's worth it. You give me strength, like no one else has ever given me before. I have a lot of doubts in life. But there is one thing I'm sure about. I wanna spend the rest of my life with you. Would you marry me? Are you okay? Me and Tony had a really big fight. Oh It's okay. It's just a fight, you guys will get past it, right? Well, where is he right now? At a party in Noto. Do you wanna go celebrate? Wherever you want. Let's go track him down. - Okay. - Let's see what he's doing! I'll be right back. Okay, we can have a drink. Oh Wow! Oh! Hi guys, it's a theme party. So girls change in here and boys over there. Do you want a drink? Okay, let's go! Oh wow! Oh! This is amazing. - Uh, drinks! Perfect! - So pretty! - Okay, what about -It's too much! - Okay. - Here! Drink. I'm really bad at drinking. - Come on, it's a party. - I'm such a lightweight Like I know, but I can't be the only drunk one. And I'll take care of you if you get too drunk, I swear! Uh, good. Wow, oh - Another one. - Okay. - Oh my God, Anna! - What? - This one! - Is that for you? - No, what? - Come on, I can't wear that! Why not? It's not for me, you know? - Oh Okay, is it too much? - I'm not sexy - You are. - And I don't think that's my color anyway. Okay It is now. Well, I guess it could be for tonight. Come on! I'm still the only one that's getting drunk. It's not right! Okay Cheers. - Wow! - Wow! Babe, don't. It's okay. Should I I feel like Should I go after him? No, it's I think you should talk about it tomorrow when you're rested. - It's all right. It's all right! - Sorry! I - That's all right. - I agree. I'm also like, a little bit drunk. So I feel like I shouldn't talk about it tonight. Yeah. Let's just. lay down for a bit, alright? It's okay. Stay away from me. Are you sure that's what you want? Hey. Had too much to drink? I saw you guys dancing in there. But I didn't say hello. I didn't wanna talk to Anna. Anna seems like the coolest, funniest, sexiest person in the world. And she is. But behind all that she's hiding what she really wants. She used me without a second thought. You kill the relationship when you lie to someone you say you love. You better watch it, Roy. But you already know exactly what she's like. You know her better than anyone. I really shouldn't have drunk. I completely overdid it. How come you left last night? What? How come you left me? Seems to me you were doing just fine without me. Well, nothing happened. Would you please look at me? Why does Anna have a tattoo exactly like yours? Why's that? -How the hell should I know -Uh. Why are you bullshitting me? What is going on between you guys? There's nothing going on, okay? - Clearly something is... - What are you stressing about? Why won't you tell me the truth? There's something I don't know. It's you, her, me in the middle and what's going on? No, listen to me. There's me and you. You invited Anna in our life. I don't wanna have anything to do with her. You're not telling me something. What aren't you telling me? Is it really that bad? You don't trust me anymore. We're supposed to be getting married now. Yes, we are getting married. I'm not fighting about this, but you're lying! Have you changed because a random girl has my tattoo, uh? I have a million tattoos on my skin. Because I know there's something else. I don't know what you're talking about. -Uh -You're stressing about nothing. Oh, hey! Roy, someone made an offer on the farm. We have to go to Noto. Okay, I I'll be out shortly, just give me a second. Yeah. Okay. We support each other, always. Okay? Tonight I'll explain. Trust me. Things have been weird lately. But I love you. Hey. We made a promise. See you later, okay? Thanks for coming. No problem. I just wanted to see it one more time, although this place really grabbed me from the get-go. It's gonna need a lot of work. Right. Sure. It's got loads of charm but it's falling apart. Still, this is the right time to invest. We'll put up a terrific resort. There's plenty of space, the location is great. We'll tear all this down and build it from scratch. I brought you this. Just to start with. It's quite a number. Can we think it over? What's going on? I already gave you an advance. It's not about that. Okay. Okay, okay, well. I can raise the offer. I need time to think it over. Until I'll hear otherwise, this place is still mine. You're wasting my time. - What just happened? - Oh, I'm sorry. I'm gonna call you soon, in the next few days. Fucking asshole! You don't wanna sell? What happened? I wanted to, but things change. Part of me wants to stay now. I feel like I'm finding my way. You couldn't wait to go home! This is where I feel at home. But she doesn't. What if I lose her? If you lose her going after what you want, you would have lost her anyway. Think about it. Viv! Why are we here? So you can see for yourself. We used to sit here together and draw. He was way better than me, always was. This was the kitchen. We used to have snacks here. We would measure each other, kept track of our progress. He was green and I was purple. This was his bedroom. I used to love playing hide and seek. I always hid under the bed, hoping he'd find me. I remember one time, we laid together for hours without saying a word. Just looking at each other. This is where the fire came up. Roy was there. He saved me. He's always been there for me and I've always been there for him. So was everything you told me a lie? Did you even fall off your bike? New Jersey? Matching tattoos? So what, you You did all this because you're still in love with him and he's still in love with you? I've been looking for you everywhere. I just I needed some time to think. I got a feeling it's not about me. It's complicated, you know? No. It's not. You don't see me. You don't see me anymore. Cause you see me? Yes. I do. What do you see? A girl who's not happy. Because her happiness is somewhere else. Where have you been? What's going on, Vivien? Can we please talk about it? Tell me what's going on! Please, just talk to me! Viv! What did she tell you? You lied to me. You acted like she was a complete stranger, you acted like you didn't know her at all! She was acting like she didn't know me! I was just trying to avoid her! I figured out it was the best thing to do! Did you fuck her at that party? No! I would never fuck her! Whatever happened between us, we were just kids! - Right. - It was years ago! New Jersey and getting matching tattoos together, that all happened a really long time ago, right? Viv. We grew up together. She's obsessed with me, she cannot let it go! But I already told her a thousand times. I don't care about her, I don't care! Please. Just give me some time. Just give me a moment, like Let's talk about it. You had plenty of time to talk about it. Let me go. Why? Why what? Why would you rather believe a total stranger than me? - Maybe there's something else! - Oh! Like what? Like you don't care that much about me. You just wanna go home. First you tell me that I have to follow my dreams, that I have to do the show. And now you're finding any excuse to go back to New Jersey! And where is your home, Roy? You gave up on us. The moment you lied to me. Viv Viv, Viv, Viv, Viv! I meant it when I asked you to marry me. I love you so much. Please don't go. I did it to save her. I never told anyone. So, that girl was Anna. Yes. It's all my fault. I destroyed the barn. Stop it! You didn't destroy anything. You saved her life. And that's the best thing you could have done. What What are you doing? You helped me with the show. And I wanna try to rebuild something. Starting with the old house. If that's okay with you. Okay. Oh You want her here, with you, don't you? - Yeah. - Then why did you let her go? I don't wanna stand in her way. How about getting out of your own way? This pain you're feeling, do something with it. Thank you. Hey. What's up? What are you doing here? I can't show these pictures anymore. Come on, man. What do you mean? Everything's ready, the opening is tomorrow! I just can't! These photos don't represent me! They're not me! Look, you're just nervous. Everything will be fine. These are the wrong pictures. Roy, we're all set to go. We don't have the time. We have all night. Please. Hey. Do you want some coffee? No I'm I'm fine, thank you. Are you sure? That's fresh. Yeah, really. I'm fine. I remember you. You wouldn't remember me. You were too young. I'm I'm looking for Roy, is he here? No. He's at the gallery. He and Thomas haven't come back yet. It happens a lot the night before an opening. Must be really hard. What? Letting him go. Yeah. Sometimes, we have to suffer for the good of other people. In the long run maybe we realize it's better for us too. What are you doing here? Waiting for you. I'm I'm sorry, I just didn't realize. What? How much you care about her. Now I know. It's too late for that. It's never too late for someone you love. Look, Anna, I haven't slept. I still have to choose the last photos and I turned everything upside down last night. Why did you do all this? I'll tell you why, you did it for her. But it won't do you any good if she can't see it. Why don't you go to her? She doesn't want me anymore. Well, did you try everything you could to get her back? No, you didn't. You'll never forgive yourself if you don't get her back. I know this because I did everything I could to get you back. And it's your turn now. We just have to learn to fly. I mean, you taught me that, remember? She'll never forgive me. Roy, if you forgave me, I don't see why she wouldn't forgive you. Now go. Go! You can't leave now. My flight leaves in an hour, I have to go. You don't have to go, you can stay here with me. I can't stay here with you. I have things to do, I have something important to me. Does that matter? Obviously matters. I don't think it does! I came here for you! So you could sell the farmhouse, money for school and now you change your all mind! Now you want something different! Every single time you want something different, I never know! One minute you want one thing, the next minute something else. I'm always here trying to play catch up! Vivien, wait, wait, wait. - Listen to me. - Why would I wait? Why would I listen? Every single time I listen, you lie to me! Every single time! Look into my eyes. I know I lied to you. I didn't want to hurt you and I've messed that up so bad. I messed up everything. This time, I won't. Just give me one hour. I need one hour of your time.
