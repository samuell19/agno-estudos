[Man Narrating] There's no doubt that when I was a kid... I was what you would call... different. Yup. That's me, Danny Valdessecchi... - followed by my loving family. - [Bellowing] They were always trying to help... always trying to save me from myself. - [Screams] - [Bellowing Continues] - [Clamoring] - Oh, sweetie! - Danny! - [Girl] Danny.! Danny.! [Clamoring] Are you okay, sweetie? - He's not moving. - Sweetie, talk to me. Are you all right? - [Child] He looks like roadkill. - I'm okay. - Way to go, asshole. - Lorenzo! [Narrating] My mom was the kind of person whose love could kill you if you weren't careful. I guess she blames herself because I was born three months premature. - Have a good day, huh? Okay. - Mom! But I was just in a hurry to get out. I'm always in a hurry. - Hi, Danny. - Hi. - [Laughing] - Pull! Pull! - Danny, switch your hands. - Dad, can I hit? No. It's Danny's turn. Here we go. All right? I'm gonna pull this thing out of the ball. - [Beeping] - It's gonna make that noise. When you hear it, whack it. - Swing! - [Beeping Continues] - You suck. - I can do it. - Get off of me. - [Danny Narrating] My dad was cool. He never worried like my mom. He knew I didn't want to go to blind school... - so he sent me to normal school, and he let me and my brother... - [Horn Blowing] - Visit him at work. - Help! There's a blind kid driving the train! Larry, my brother... only two years older than me, was a boy with a mission. - [Shouting] - He took it upon himself at an early age... to teach me about life. - Come on, Danny. - [Girl] Don't do it. - You're gonna love it. - Remember the last time? You keep out of this. This candy's not for little girls. This candy's only for men. Come on, Danny. Take a piece. - Take it! - [Laughing] - No! - It's dog shit again. - [Narrating] And as we grew up, Larry's life lessons continued. - [TV: Woman Moaning] Larry, what's happening? - Is she dying? - [Moaning Continues] - It's your mom. - Shoot. Lorenzo! [Speaking Italian] And in front of Danny. - What's the problem? He can't see nothin'. - God can see! [Danny Narrating] Needless to say that by the time I was a young man... I needed help. [Woman] Try to be more specific, Danny. Why do you think you feel this way? Uh, l-I guess I'm just curious. You know? [Chuckles] I mean, I run my fingers over my face... but that tells me shit about how I look. - And that matters to you, does it? - Sure. Yeah. Of course it does. You know, even Marie's got these friends, and they come by... and she's 14 years old. You know, these girls freak me out. I wanna know that girls are attracted to me... and don't just feel sorry for me... aren't giving me pity. I feel like I'm a 12-year-old trapped in a 22-year-old body. You know? It's perfect. [Laughs] I'm a 22-year-old blind virgin... who doesn't know a thing about girls. I at least wanna know that I don't look like some kind of monster. [Whispering] Oh, believe me, Danny... you don't look like a monster. Doc, are you naked again? Mm. I'm sorry, Danny. Aw, Doc, you promised you weren't gonna do that anymore. [Stammering] It's something... A little problem. I'm working on it. Doc, you're one of the smartest people I know... but you might be crazier than most of your patients. It's just that sometimes I just feel this need to break out. To be free. To be who I really am. I'm sorry, Danny. It will never happen again. I promise. - You said that last time. - I know. I know. And I'll probably say it again. You're a kook, you know that? But I love you. Yup. Yup. So. Where were we? [Danny Narrating] Okay, so apart from the fact... that I got this problem with women... I'm handling things pretty well. - [Together] Hiya, Danny. - Hi, girls. He's so cute. (music)[Singing In Italian] (music)[Opera On Stereo] - Danny? Danny. - Yeah, Mom? Come on in. Your father wants to talk to you. (music)[Danny's Father Stops] (music)[Stereo Continues] Sit down. Don't you want to sit down? No. What's up? - I say go for it, Danny. - Go for what? - It's too dangerous. - Ma. How could you do this to me? How could I do what to you? What are you talking about? - But it's Danny's big chance. - It's out of the question. Does somebody wanna fill me in on what we're talkin' about? - You stay out of it. - All right, shut up. Shut up. - All of you, shut up. - (music)[Opera Continues] Danny, we got a call from a doctor. Doctor... What was his name? - Perkins. - That wasn't it. - Yeah, it was Perkins. - No, it wasn't. It was something else. - [Mother] You said it was... - It's Perkins. A Dr. Perkins. He said you were maybe gonna volunteer... for some sort of experimental operation. Maybe it can make you see. What's goin' on here? How come you never said nothin'? I didn't say anything because I haven't volunteered for anything yet. - You don't talk to me about these things anymore? - It's not a big deal. Yes, this is a very big deal. What's goin' on? It's not gonna happen. There are risks. You don't know. There could be problems. Mom, you wanna let him make up his mind for once in his life? - Ma, what if he could see? - Exactly. What if he can see? You are a guinea, not a guinea pig. Oh, where you goin'? Come back here. - [Chattering] - This is exactly why I didn't want to say anything. I didn't want to worry you, Ma. I didn't want to get everybody's hopes up either. You know, I don't even know if I wanna go through with this yet. Danny, it's your call. Whatever you decide to do... - we're all behind you. - I know. I know. Right? Well, I'm hungry. Ma, how about some dinner? [Man On TV] Where I'm going, you can't follow. What I've got to do, you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble... but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people... - [Mouthing Words] - Don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Here's looking at you, kid. (music)[Acoustic Guitar: Blues] [Man] Yo, D.! Yo, Danny boy.! Danny boy! Jay, what's up? Hey, man, I got some ballers down at the court who swear they got game. [Chuckling] - So what do you think? Wanna make some bucks? - Yeah. Let's do it. Danny. Are you nuts? Danny, what are you doing? Danny! Yo! Whoo. That's it. I'm convinced. You are the Batman. - How's your sonar? - Good. Let's do it. - [Danny] Make some money? - [Jay] Easy. Hey! Hey, you guys. This is the guy I was telling you about. And like I said, if he wins, you guys gotta pay five to one. - It's only fair. - How's he gonna know where the hoop is? What are you, the handicap police? Take a shot. Show 'em. - Oops. - Um... Bring it, fellas. Let's try 10 bucks. - Ten bucks? - That's 50 bucks if he wins. Hey, man, he's blind as a bat. We got this. - Ready? - Don't worry about it. It's easy money. All right. Let me see the ball. Stevie Wonder's gotta shoot first. - What? - Follow the voice. [Jay] Right here. Oh! Danny, follow the voice. That-a-boy. Oh, goodness. Three times in a row? Now, that was net, but it's still good. Oh, you guys got a "H. ' Poetry in motion. - [Man Groans] - [Jay] Oh.! You got an "O. ' Backboard. You got an "R. ' - Come on! - Nothing but net. - You guys got an "S. ' - [Man] That was net, wasn't it? - Don't hurt 'em. - [Man Groans] [Jay] Oh.! Almost. "E. ' You guys lose. Pay up. Here we go. - Now we're talking. - Let's go. - Fifty bucks, man. You are amazing. - Fifty bucks! - Of course I am. - You're gonna have most of my tuition paid. - Think of it as like a basketball scholarship. - I hear that, man. How about you? What's goin' on with that night law school thing? - Got my first class comin' up. - Really? Ready? - Of course I am, man. - That-a-boy. [Family] Oh.! - [Larry] I'm here to eat, please. - Lucia, the meats! - All right. - I'm hungry here. Gina said if you ask her out, she'll say yes. - Hit me. Hit me. - [Danny] I don't think so. You're so strange. How come you never want to go out with my friends? - Leave your brother alone. - Because they're 14, Marie. - What could these girls offer him? - What could these... The time of his life, Ma. That's what they could offer him. - Not everyone is like you, Lorenzo. - That's what you think. At least now you're in your own apartment, you don't bring 'em here anymore. - [Larry Laughing] Thank God. - See? This is why I love comin' over here. Danny, do you remember that girl? Remember? Ass like a coconut, huh? - My God. - She's layin'in the bathtub. He has no idea. He turns on the water. - She almost has a heart attack. - [Father] Basta. - We're eatin'. What's the matter with you? - Sorry. Marie, forgive me. So, Danny, when are you gonna tell us more about this operation? Let me volunteer first, Pop. What's the hurry? The doctor said family is important. Yeah, Ma, it's important to stay out of it. - To give support. - Maybe tomorrow we can drive you there. - No, it's all right. Jay's giving me a ride. - Oh, Jay's got wheels now. Huh? [Horn Blowing] (music)[Man Singing: Rock] Let go of my ears. - (music)[Continues] - Think that's funny? Oh, shit! - Come on.! - Yeah, buddy. - (music)[Continues] - Here it is. - Come on. - Whoo.! Hold on. Hold on. Whoa. Hey! Whoa! Whoa! Danny, what are you doin'? It's like Six Flags, man. Okay! Move! Whoa! - [Laughs] - Here we are. Hold on, Danny. - All right. - (music)[Fades] - Oh! - Made it. - Nice wheels, man. - Chicks dig it. - Where you at? - (music)[Ends] - Hey, you gonna be all right to make it home? - Yeah. - All right, buddy. Have a good one, all right? - All right, bud. - Four-eyes. - Hey, quit it. No name calling. You promised you'd be good. [Woman] I thought you told Mom... you were gonna behave while she was gone. - [Groans] - [Children Laughing] - Are you okay? - I'm fine. - [Baby Crying] - No! - Where's Doris? - Honey... - Why don't you get back? - Hey! Where's Doris? - Look, what do you want? Can't you see I'm busy? - No. I can't see that you're busy. Can't you see that I'm fuckin' blind? He said the "B" word. He said the "B" word. - What happened to Doris? - She's on vacation. That's too bad. I liked her. What are you starin' at? The signal from the camera, which is mounted on the glasses... goes directly to a chip... which is implanted in the visual cortex of the brain. - So my eyes are not a part of the process then? - Absolutely. The camera bypasses them. But, Danny, remember, we don't see with our eyes. We see with our brains. Now, I'd like to tell you... that if the operation is successful... you would be able to see like everyone else. Well, that's not going to happen. The best you could hope for... is a fuzzy black-and-white image. Maybe it'll be good enough to keep from bumping into things. Maybe it'll be enough to see a face. [Phone Beeps] Yeah? Oh. Thank you. Yes, please. That's Dr. Evans. I've asked her to join us. I know you know her. You feel comfortable with her. She's going to be a vital member of the team. Dr. Evans. Oh. Dr. Perkins. - Amarige. - Oh. [Chuckles] Yes, Danny, that's right. That's... It's my new scent. - Do you like it? - Yeah. Yeah, it suits you. What do you think, Doc? Smells good. Dr. Evans is going to be responsible... for putting together the psychological reports... of all the potential candidates for this operation. - I got no problem with that. - Good. So then all we really need to know... is that if the F.D.A. Gives us the green light... can we put you down as a potential candidate? [Dr. Evans] Oh, you can take your time, Danny. I mean, this is a very important decision. So, uh, do you have someone meeting you? No. I'll get a cab if you can point me in the right direction. - You know how to get out of the building? - Got it memorized, Doc. Okay, you hang to the left, go about 15 paces. You should reach the street, and a cab should be waiting there. - Sounds good. - Okay. I can take him, Dr. Perkins. I'm leaving now. - I think I can manage, Doris. - The name's Leeza. Why doesn't he use his cane? Because he doesn't think of himself as blind. Good night, Doris. Good night, Danny. [Laughs] Taxi. Yo! [Speaking Foreign Language] Leeza, you're late. - They're waiting for you. - [Gasps] Arvind's here. - And Mr. Bhat. - I'm sorry. I forgot. I don't think you should say that to your future husband. Let me look at you. Go, go, go. Go. - You're in big trouble. - Oh, take a hike, Ravi... or I'll tell them what I found under your bed. - Arvind. Hey. - Hey. - I'm sorry I'm late. - It's okay. I apologize for keeping you waiting. - [Speaking Foreign Language] - What? - Do you not speak English? - Of course I speak English. [Speaking Foreign Language] I see your daughter does not follow our traditions of respect for elders... - and punctuality. - For my daughter, punctuality is an aspiration. - Dad. - Her respect has to be earned. [Chattering] [Woman] I guess so. I took that class last semester. Watch it, man. That's my computer. I'm sorry. I didn't see it. - Just pick it up and give it to me. - Relax. I'm looking for it. - Just give it back. - [Man] He's blind. [Larry] So they know you're blind. They were gonna find out sooner or later. It's none of their business. Besides the fact he was rude. I should have smacked his face. - You didn't tell me he was rude to you. - Yeah. He was rude. You want me to turn around? I'll beat the shit out of him. [Laughing] - No, killer. Maybe later. - [Woman, Muffled] All right. All right. Okay. - Okay. Christ.! - [Rhythmic Thumping] Larry, is there someone in the back? Yeah. Suzie's in the back. - S-Suzie? - Suzie. - Who's Suzie? - Um, hmm... - [Suzie Continues, Indistinct] - Danny, Suzie's a hooker. - And she's in the back with someone? - Yes, she is. Aw, Jesus. What's goin' on? When I haven't got a booking... I've been renting out the car to my lady friends... and they take care of the business in the back with their johns. Now, the johns... They have to pay an extra 50, 'cause that's classified as kinky sex. That extra 50 goes to the house... - yours truly. - Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Hey, you wanna go get something to eat, man? This soundtrack's making me hungry. (music)[Jukebox: Rock And Roll] So are you gonna go through with this surgery or operation, or what? I don't know. What do you have to lose, huh? - Half my brain. - Half your brain? What do you mean? I told you, they have to implant this chip in my brain. This is, like, brain surgery? [Chuckles] Yes, genius, like brain surgery. - Look at you. You're a slob. - What are you doin'? - Get out of here with that. - You're makin' a mess. - Filthy. - Touch your face. So this might have, like, a significant "oops" factor, huh? - What? - "Oops. We lost the happy childhood memories. Sorry." - Mmm. Exactly. - What's the upside? Well, they said if it works... and it's like the mother of all ifs... they can get a, uh... fuzzy black-and-white image. No, no, no. We don't want anything less than full-blown high-definition color. You know? Digital. Thank you. - Denver. - It was Dallas. - He killed a man in Dallas just to see if he was dead. - "Watch him die." - Larry? Excuse me. - Listen to the song! This gentleman has a favor to ask you. - Photo. - Photo, yeah. Photo. - Oh, you want me to take a picture. Sure. All right. - Okay. - All right, here we go. Ready? - Don't press the boobs, sweetie. One, two, three. Oh. - There we go. - Thank you, Larry. Thank you. Thank you. - Arigato. - Arigato. Arrigatori. - Arigato. - Arigato. [Laughing] Whoo. Thank you. Thank you, sweetheart. [Clears Throat] Who's your friend? Oh, Suzie. This is my brother, Danny. - Get out of town. - That's him. Well! Have you told your brother how handsome he is? - I haven't today. - Well, tell him. Hey, Danny. You're gorgeous. [Laughs] Well, you are. Thank you. Hey, Danny? Anytime that you want to go... in the back of your brother's limo with me... you just let me know. Okay? No charge, of course. - Will do. - [Laughing] Will do. - There you go. He's a charmer. - All righty. - Okay, you boys. - All right, you little sex kitten. - Y'all have a great night. - Hey, I'll see you tomorrow. - Yeah, I'll see you, hot stuff. - Damn right. Mmm. Ooh. That's my kind of woman. She just made you an offer you can't refuse. Oh, stop it. Hey, Danny, you know what? Don't-Don't bullshit me. Watch your step. You know, we both know you haven't done it. And at your age it's not natural, man. You could start to build up all kinds of pressure... and let's not forget about your prostate. Okay? No, no, no, no. Hold on. Hold on. Okay. This is why old guys have all those problems... No sex. Do you think the fact that I haven't had a relationship hasn't been on my mind? I'm not talking about a relationship. I'm talkin' about sex. Danny, you do wanna do it with a woman, right? - Yes, of course I do. - All right. I just had to ask, all right? You gave me a little bit of a heart-stopper there for a second. Look, you don't understand, Larry. I don't want something cheap. I'm lookin' for the real thing. Fine. I'll set you up with one nice girl. I don't want anything arranged either. I don't want a hooker. Danny, okay. No hookers. I'll find a good girl for you. No, I don't think so. We've been through this before. You know what I think? I think you're scared. - Bullshit. - Afraid of a little vagina? - Shut your mouth. - Scared of the vagina. [Groans] [Danny] It's gotta be a real date. - You know, dinner and everything. - Yeah. And then, you know, take her back to my place. If we feel something for each other... and she wants to do it, then we'll do it. - Only if she wants to do it. - Yeah. Yeah, Danny, that's how it usually works. Otherwise they arrest you and charge you with rape. - [Laughing] - What are you laughing at? - What? - I'm just thinking it would be like a real blind date. Danny, really, after 22 years you just thought of that joke? - Oh, my God. - Do me a favor. Don't... Can you turn the window down, please? You're still wearing that cologne? [Larry] You don't like that? Patchouli. Are you breakin'my balls or you really don't like that? - So who is she? - (music)[Pop, Indistinct] I don't know. Mandy someone. Do you trust Larry? What if she's, like, a dog? Okay. That's good. Stand up. - You look good. - Yeah. - I like the hair. - Yeah. - Oh, what is this now? - Huh? - How does he look? - How do I look? - You look like a jackass, Danny. - What? He looks good. - Did you do this? - Yeah. - What? - We gotta change that shirt. - What's wrong with the shirt? - Nothing's wrong with his shirt. A lot is wrong with that shirt. We don't need another Tony Soprano in our house. Do not say anything bad about Tony Soprano. - Larry, you can leave now. - Guys, guys, the shirt. The shirt... What's wrong? - Larry? - Out. I was just trying to help. Larry, what is it? What is it? - What's wrong with it? - It's very loud. Okay, well, pick another one. This is a nice shirt. I bought you this shirt. Come on! Come on, come on. - So how do you know her? - She's a friend of a friend. - Unbelievable. - What? I'm not done yet, Danny. You make a blood oath that she isn't a dog, or I stay. - Are you kidding me? - No. - You don't trust me anymore? - In one word, no. - And why not? - Are you forgetting Graziella Morino in the 10th grade? - "Gorilla" Morino? - Yeah. Some people thought that girl was hot. She smelled like a shaggy carpet. Make the oath or I stay. - Fine. I'll make your stupid oath. - Go ahead. Aw, God, that hurts! - Sharp edge, Larry. - All right. No, no, no. - A blood oath is when we both cut ourselves. - Uh-uh. - Yeah, that's what it is. - No. - You cut yourself. - Cut yourself. - You do it first. - Do it. - No. - Cut yourself. - Are you gonna do it? - [Laughing] No. - Then let's get out of here. - Fine. This is ridiculous. Come on. [Indistinct Conversations] Okay, Mandy, it's my pleasure... to introduce you to my brother, Danny. - Very nice to meet you. [Chuckles] - [Chuckles] [Clears Throat] After you. [Voice Breaking] Oh, you poor man. [Whimpering] - Please. - [Crying] Danny. Come on. [Sniffling] - I'm so sorry. - No, no. No, no, no. I'm sure you'll feel much better after we get some food. - I'm sure. - Okay. Okay. All right. [Sniffling] - [Chuckles] - So you're really blind? - Yes. - [Blubbering] [Blubbering Continues] - [Whimpering] - Signorina. Look, please... Please stop crying. Stop it. You know, just think... I've been like this since I was born. - I don't know any differently. - How brave. Why don't we talk about you? How's that? We'll talk about you. Tell me something about yourself. There's not much to tell, really. I'm 25 years old, and I work as a secretary. People think I look like Meryl Streep. [Laughing] - [Chuckles] - [Wheezing Laugh] [Gasps] But you'll never know what Meryl Streep looks like. [Sobbing] Oh, God! Oh, God! - [Whimpering] - [Indistinct] I think the next one shouldn't be so sensitive. - Evening. - [Man] Right this way, sir. Get out of my way, asshole. Can't you see he's blind? Look what you did. Danny, come here, honey. Let me help you. - All right. [Grunts] - Okay. Put me down. Put me down. Put me down! I can walk. I was just tryin' to help. You gonna get the door or what, Tupac? Let's go. - Yes. I'm on it. - Larry. Larry. - There you go. - Thank you. - Very welcome. - Ladies first? - [Thuds] - Oh! - I'm sorry. - I'm fine. Really, I'm fine. Go ahead. Cheers, baby. So, Danny, tell me. You a physical guy? Like to do some workin' out? - Uh, sure. - What do you press? - Fifty pounds, maybe. - I like that. I like a man with a sense of humor. Mama's gonna help you out. - There you go. - You know... I can... I can eat on my own. It's fine. Hey, I'm just trying to create some chemistry, baby. I gotta go to the bathroom. - I'll take ya. - L-l-I can walk. Oh, Mama hasn't had action like this in weeks. I'm hungry. Let's go. - Oh, God. - Danny boy! - Oh, my God. - Mama's here! - Danny? Danny! - Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. You better get your ass in here. She's crazy. Danny, open this door! Danny! Signora, I must ask you to leave. Oh, don't "signora'me, Pablo. You just better hold onto your squirrel before he loses his nuts. Signora, take your time. Can I get you something to drink? - An espresso, perhaps? - Out. - Just get in here. - Danny? Danny? - Oh, God! Get in here! - You ever done it in a bathroom, Danny? - [Woman] Larry.! Larry.! - [Pounding On Window] - [Woman Shouting, Pounding] - I just wanna meet a normal woman. Damn it.! I'm gonna get you.! Honey, you do not cross Big Mama.! - I've been looking so forward to this night... - Yeah. That I brought a little something along with me as a surprise. All right. Danny, I wanna feel the way that you feel. I wanna see the things that you see. I wanna be as one with you, Danny. Look. I have a blindfold. - I can see the blackness. - Larry! [Tires Squealing] - [Indistinct Conversations] - Doris still on vacation? You're very good at this, aren't you? I've got great insight. I'll tell him you're here. [Dr. Evans] This is a very big decision, Danny. - Are you sure you want to do it? - Yeah. Sure, I am. It's very brave of you, Danny. It's not like I'm volunteering for a suicide mission here, is it? No. No, uh... What I meant to say was... neurosurgery is never without risks... - and it would be wrong of me to say otherwise. - Well, then what are the risks? We really don't know. [Whispering] Help. L... I think that what Dr. Perkins is trying to say is that... you're very courageous to try something... that has not been done very often. Oh, I can take Mr. Valdessecchi to a cab, Doctor... - if he wants. - Sure. [Danny] He told me that... Oh, there you go. There's always risks with brain surgery, but... I figure, what the hell. You gotta be brave sometime. Sure, you gotta be brave, but it's not so smart to walk around without a cane. Step. - Thanks, Mom. - You're welcome. You're in luck. Here's a cab. Uh, got a confession to make. I don't really need a cab. I just kind of wanted to talk with you a while. Oh. Um, that's very sweet. My brother Larry's coming to pick me up. He, um, runs a limo service. - Larry's, uh... Larry's Limos. - Oh. - He's not here yet. - How can you tell? [Chuckles] If Larry were here, trust me, you'd know it. But anyway, when he comes, maybe we can give you a ride? Oh, um, thanks, but I'd better not. And my bus is here, so I'd better go. - Yeah. Okay. - Okay. - Bye. - Okay. See you soon. - Thanks, Mom. - Thank you. If she brings us any more food... - we can open our own restaurant. - We don't have to. After we get married, we're gonna take over this one. It's all been discussed. Oh. And... what else has been discussed? That you'll run this place until we start having kids. And have you discussed when that is gonna be? Well, the sooner the better, and, um... [Whispering] I say we start practicing now. Arvind, what if I don't want to run this restaurant? What if I want to go to medical school? [Laughs] What? Oh, God. Ravi. Sorry. [Clears Throat] You know, the final choice isn't going to be made on ophthalmic criteria. It's probably going to be made on a candidate's personality. His ability to cope with the success or failure of the operation. Danny. Do you want to join me for lunch? I go to the park across the road. I got turkey and cheese. Do you have any shrimp? - No. - All right. [Laughs] - [Boys Shouting] - My brother, Larry... when I was a kid... told me that kids were supposed to run free in the park... 'cause that's what parks are for. But he didn't tell me about trees. - I really hate trees. - [Laughs] Like, a lot. You wanna take a walk? Wait a minute. You want me to follow you? - No, you lead. Just give me your shoulder. - All right. - We're taking these. - Okay. - Where are we going? - You like baseball? - I don't know. I've never been. - You've never been? - No. - God, you'd love it. It's a beautiful game. I mean, you've got the smell of the grass. You've got the sound of the ball when it gets crushed. - There's nothing like it. - Maybe I should go some time. Has Dr. Perkins talked to you about the operation? Yeah. He said the final choice will be based on personality. [Laughing] You're not gonna have a problem there. I don't know. I'm not so sure about that. Danny, I've worked with a lot of visually impaired people... and I can honestly say I've never met anyone like you. - What do you mean? - Well... It's this feeling you give to other people. And you don't use your cane. - I use my cane. - Not always. And that's stupid and dangerous and... also kind of brave. - Have you ever thought of a guide dog? - Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love dogs. I've just got this little problem with dog shit. I guess what I'm trying to tell you is you're okay. Think I'm okay enough to have dinner with me? Okay. [Chattering] Who are these friends you're going out with? Just friends from the hospital, Mom. Bye! [Whistle Blows] [Indistinct Conversations] - Thank you. - [Danny] Thanks. I mean, I like that book too. I mean, I like to read, but I love to watch movies because in movies they don't... They don't describe the trees and the sky... and the... and the birds and all that stuff. In movies they just talk. They just talk. And when I hear someone's voice, I mean, it tells me... It tells me... It tells me so much about people. Like your voice. Your voice tells me that, uh... What? That you have short, dark hair... and, uh, you have these, uh... You have these big, beautiful dark eyes. Dr. Perkins could have told you that. No, it's your voice. I'm telling you, it's your voice. I mean, your hair... I can tell that it's short... because I can't hear it swishing around. Although I did take a chance on your eyes, but now I know it's true. They are... They are, uh, big and beautiful. Well, I figure a lawyer, you know, has got to be able to read people's minds... and when you're blind that's mostly what you do. And are you reading my mind? - Yeah, sure. - And? I can tell that you want to be here... but there's also something holding you back... and I don't know what it is. I think you're gonna be a very good lawyer. - (music)[Slow Pop] - What I'd really like to do is... - go to medical school. - Mm-hmm. And then join Dr. Perkins' research team. - Why can't you? - It's not that simple. - I'm a woman. - (music)[Woman Singing, Indistinct] I noticed. [Chuckles] And one day I'd like to get married, have a family. Think you could do both? No. Not without an understanding husband. Hmm. Then you're just gonna have to choose the right one. (music)[Continues] (music)[Woman Singing, Ends] That is one fine lady with you, Mr. Valdessecchi. Thank you, James. I can smell when Mrs. Luciano... - makes fettuccini from three blocks away. - Mm-hmm. Or when they cut grass at the baseball field. - I love your perfume. - [Chuckles] And your smile. Do you smell that? The blossoms are out early this year. - Now you're showing off. - [Laughs] - Is there anybody else around? - No, we're alone. I've had the best night I've ever had. I just hope it's been half as good for you. I've had a wonderful time. All right, thanks. I'll take care of it, Larry. No problem. An oil leak now. So you gonna tell me about it? She's the most natural person in the whole world. And she's got the most beautiful smile. [Chuckles] Danny, how do you know what her smile looks like? You wouldn't understand. It's... It's the sound of it. I love the sound of her smile. So why didn't you take her back to my place last night? Oh, because not everything's got to come down to sex. That's true. Money and looks are important too. - Oh, hey, Mike. - [Man] Yeah? Don't forget to clean those footprints off my ceiling. - I got it. - Unbelievable. What's so unbelievable? - Your face. - It's hot. [Chattering] - Hi. - Hey. They're gorgeous. Thank you. Do you like Humphrey Bogart? I like Humphrey Bogart. - Let's go, kid. - [Giggles] - [Woman] What about us? - We'll always have Paris. We didn't have. We'd lost it until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night. When I said I would never leave you. And you never will, but I've got a job to do too. Danny, I've got to go. - No. Don't go. - [Laughs] Um... Leeza, I've... I've never felt this way for anyone before. I'll see you soon, okay? Yeah. - Bye. - Bye. Arvind will take over the business in a few years when I retire. And with a loyal wife by his side... he will be well able to provide for his family. Arvind's ability to provide for his future family... is in no doubt, because he is Indian. And there should be no doubt about the loyalty of his future wife either. I wanna tell you how proud we all are of you, Danny. First, for getting chosen for this operation... and second, for having the palle to go through with it. - What does palle' mean? - Balls. Stop corrupting Marie. Come on, please. Um, thank you, Pop. Thank you, Larry. I would just like to say that... if this thing does work out... and I can see your faces for the first time... and I find out you're all too ugly, I'm moving out. - Hey. - Chin-chin. [Together] Salud.! - [Children Chattering] - [Danny] Dr. Perkins says... if it's successful... I might be able to see well enough to... get around. Even identify faces. I might be able to see your face. I'll know what you look like. Only a man can cause joy one day and tears the next. What has Arvind done? Mom, it isn't Arvind. He's a Hindu? He's not Indian. A few years after I came to this country I met this man. An American. He was very handsome, like a movie star. And every time I saw him my heart jumped. Mom. What happened? Oh, he met a beautiful American girl. - Oh. - Nothing to be sad about. Just thankful. I met your father just after that. You're my only daughter... and I love you very much... but you've made a promise to Arvind. And only you can decide if you can honor that promise or not. L-I'm sorry. I should have told you earlier. What are you talking about? What is that supposed to mean? Danny, I've had a wonderful time with you... and no one's ever made me feel this way... but I'm engaged to be married. Engaged to be married? What is that supposed to mean? L-It means I can't see you anymore. Am I missing something here? L-I don't understand. L-I'm sorry. I should have told you earlier. Do you love this guy? - Do you? - He's a nice guy, Danny. That doesn't answer my question. Do you love him? It's not that simple. There's a lot more to it than that. Just be honest with me. At the end of the day... you'd rather be with someone who can see... instead of some asshole blind guy. [Larry] Danny, you know, I know what it's like to get dumped. Okay? I understand. What you gotta do is look at it... like you're one of these one-in-10 guys, okay? For every 10 noes that you get... you're gonna get one yes, okay? So this no is really just bringing you that much closer to a yes. You gotta trust me on this, Danny. It's all mathematics. [Jay] Ready, set... - [Ball Beeping] - Pitch! Whoa! Whoo! Man! That would have been a double for sure. I smell money, man. - Hey. Hey, hey. - What's up? So, really, it doesn't bother you... you know, that I can't see, does it? - Nah. - Even when we were in school and you had to help me? Ahh. Wait a second. It's those girls you been dating. - I just don't get it, man. - Look, Danny boy. Girls are something you cannot figure out, all right? If they can't realize that you're a good cat and you got it goin'on, screw 'em. You're wild, man. Your hormones are jumping up. Come on. Next pitch. So where are we going? I just wanted to get some air. Oh. [Indistinct Conversation] And so does your family. - Come on. - Arvind! - Leeza? - It's okay. You look so beautiful tonight, and I just wanted a little bit of time alone with you. These pumpkins have been calling out to me all night. - Hello! - Arvind, stop it. - It's okay. We're gonna get married. - [Chattering] [Horn Honks] - [Chattering] - Stop. [Groaning] Sorry. Arvind. Arvind, I'm sorry. Arvind, look... - (music)[Dance Beat] - [Larry]... nine, 10, 11... 12, 13... [Groans] Larry, bar. - Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, buddy. - [Grunts] Here. There you go. Pump them out. Good. - Need some help? - No, no, no. I got it. All right. Push through it. - You got it. - Yeah. - One... - That's it. - Two... - Good. Three, four... - Good. - Five... - [Groaning] - Oh, yeah. - Man. - Oh, I'm done. How'd that one rep treat you? Hmm? Very, very impressive. Hey, Danny, let's go. - Hit the showers. - Yeah. Yeah. All right, pick something cool. Think James Dean. Did you mess up my hair? It looks fine. - Come on. - So, who'd Larry fix you up with this time? - [Whistle Blows] - [Man] Pick it up. Right there. Ooh! [Gasps, Laughs] [Inhales, Exhales] [Clears Throat] Um... So, Larry tells me you're in the... in the service industry. That... That's great. What do you do exactly? [Laughs] The service industry. I like that. That's... That's a good one. - [Exhales] - [Cell Phone Rings] This is Dolores. Yeah, it's 500. That's not including cab fare. Call me in, like, um... two hours. - No, I don't do seniors. - [Phone Snaps Shut] Oh, come on! - [Chattering] - No, no. Yeah, she was great. - We had a good time. [Chuckles] - Larry! Where's Dolores? [Groans] - What did I say? What did I say? - Oh, God! - No hookers, right? - [Groaning] - Danny, get in the car, man. Get in the car, Danny. - Jesus! - Oh, my God. - Lar, you all right? - No. Ah. - Come on, Danny. - Get in the car, Larry. - Signor. - You punch like a... bitch! - [Danny] Shut your mouth and get in the car. - It'll stop bleedin', you pussy. - [Groans] [Larry] Danny, you know, l-I was tryin'to help you out, man. And I figured maybe, you know, you could use a little push. There was one other girl I was thinking about setting you up with. And this girl... [Exhales] She's... She's a real bombshell, man. New client of mine. - Top-class action. - No. Fine. - Fine. - Fine. - Fine. - Fine. - She's top class? - That's what I said. - All right. On one condition. - What? - She can't know I'm blind. - Are you nuts? It's too risky, man. I don't see the point of it. You don't see the point? The point is crystal clear, all right? On each of the dates they weren't dating me. They were dating some blind guy. I don't want their pity. Are you saying you don't want a sympathy lay? Tissue. At least you're on the right track. How do you think you're gonna pull this off? Huh? Easy. All right. You ready? Come on. - All right. Now you got the step... - I know the step. - One, two, three, four... - Hold. Tell me: What's to your left... - All right. - Thank you very much, Larry. Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Good evening, Mr. Valdessecchi. - Bling you very much, James. - My man. Ah, signor! The corner table as usual. Grazie, Pietro. Eight. [Sighs] One, two, three, four... five. Thank you, Pietro. Uh... Bottle of your single-vineyard Syrah. Say "something earthy and jammy." Something earthy and jammy. Well done. Well done. Bravo. Bravo. (music)[Man Singing R&B On Stereo] - (music)[Continues] - A littler louder. - Not too loud though, okay? Something... - That's good, right? - Yeah. Something nice and mellow. - Okay. Right there. And this is a six-CD changer. So if she doesn't like the music, you just hit this button here... - and it changes the CD, okay? - [Music][music] [Pop] - Just be careful, you know? - Yeah. - [Music][music] [Rock] - That's FM radio, Danny, okay? Look. Just... Just... All right, look. No, no, no, no. You don't gotta push anything else. - All you're gonna have to do is push play. - All right. - Be very careful. - All right. - [Turns Off] - [Sputters] - [Laughing] - That's not funny. - [Laughing Continues] - All right, Danny, look. Now... if you ever get this far... then you're gonna need one of these. That's a condom. It's for safe sex. There's nothing worse than a blind guy with genital warts. - It's squidgy. - Yes, Danny. It is squidgy. This is something you're gonna have to do on your own. I cannot help you with it. But think of it like homework. Not now. Oh, you like that condom, don't you? Hmm. Larry, none of them fit. [Sighs] I put 'em on, but they're too big. They keep on falling off. That's impossible, Danny. You're a Valdessecchi. I've been trying for the last two hours. Danny, you stayed up for two hours? - What do you mean, up? - Daniel, you can't put the condom on... unless you're stiff, you know? - [Laughs] - You never told me that. - [Wrapper Rustling] - Danny, what is that? Just opening another one, see if it fits. Are you chewing on the condoms? They taste like heaven, man. Why are you putting me on here? You know I'm busy right now. - [Man] Here's your ticket. - [Man #2] Thanks very much. - Ah, yes. Good evening, Mr. Valdessecchi. - Thank you, James. I really need a moment of your time, sir. It's gonna be about an hour. - How long? - Five minutes, sir. - Thank you. - Ah, buona sera, signore. You have a reservation? Yes. Where's, uh... Where's Pietro? He's out with a dreadful flu... or so he says. [Sniffs] What was the name on the reservation? Valdessecchi. Right this way. [Clears Throat] Scusi, signore. Your table is this way. Corner table, right? [Man] No. As you can see, this table is occupied. Uh, sorry. - [Shouts In Japanese] - Sushi. Yes, sir? - I arranged the corner table with Pietro. - Well, he did not tell me. [Mouthing Words] Right this way. - [Gasps] - Excuse me. Excuse me. Sir, is everything all right? Ow! Guy, guy, tell me: How far is it to the table from here? - I beg your pardon? - Just listen very carefully. From where I'm standing right now, how many steps to the table? I'd... I'd say about 20. - Which direction? Use the hours on a clock face. - Uh, 9:00. - Anything in the way? - Mm, no. Okay. Okay. Now you're gonna walk in front of me. Walk slowly. And keep on talking so I know where you are. Look. I don't know what's going on ex... - [Patrons Murmuring] - Why didn't you tell me you were stopping? [Man] I didn't know I had to stop. Won't happen again. Right this way, sir. - Here is your table. - Great. - What took you so long? - Ah. I was just saying hi to some friends... from Japan. Well, this is my good side. - You want some wine? I feel like some wine. - Oh, yes. Waiter. - Wine, sir? - Great. Um... Perfect. I will take a bottle of your single-vineyard Syrah. That's earthy and jammy, right? - Let's order. I'm starving. - Oh, yeah. [Giggling] Mmm. Mmm. [Giggles] Uh... Danny, you have some chocolate sauce on your chin. You are not doing a very good job of cleaning that up. Let me. You're so different from the other men I date. You're just like a little boy. But you know what I like most about you? Your eyes. And the way you look at me. We can go back to your place now. (music)[Woman Singing] (music)[Continues] [Laughing] Check. With pleasure. (music)[Continues] [Woman] You silly little boy. Oh. Who needs ice cream when you've got dessert like this? [Laughing] Yeah. - (music)[Continues] - [Both Sigh] - [Growls] - (music)[Ends] (music)[Man Singing R&B On Stereo] - (music)[Continues] - Mmm. Such a sexy night. Don't you think? Yes, it is. [Music][music] [Humming] Here we go. - Oh... [Gasping] - Oh, my God, I am so sorry. Oh, my God. Are you all right? - Um, the bathroom's over here. Just... - Oh, my gosh. It's okay. It's... It's, uh... It's my friend's dress anyway, so... Whew! I guess I'm gonna have to get out of this now. Um... Yeah, definitely. Um... - Why don't... Let's go... I'll take you to the bathroom. - Mm-mmm. - It's over there. Let me change the music. - Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm. - I'm so sorry about that. - You... just sit back and enjoy the show, Mr. Blue Eyes. [Music] 'Cause you're a cutie patootie [music] [Music] And I shake my little booty [music] Oh! [Laughs] [Music] And look at the chair [music] [Music] And now I'm shakin' my sexy hair [music] [Grunting] [Music](music) Oh, yeah [music](music) [Music] Do you like what you see [music] - [Music] Yeah, you do [music][music] - Never seen better. Yeah, baby! [Exclaims, Grunts] [Music][music] [Vocalizes] [Whoops, Laughs] Now you like what you see. Now you like what you see, right? You like it. Oh. [Laughs] Well, the CDs certainly like it. Now let's see if we are having the desired effect. (music)[Stereo Continues] I knew something was wrong. - Why didn't you tell me? - No, no. Look. No. I just thought that maybe I could go out with someone... who didn't first have to come to terms with the fact that I'm blind. Blind? I thought you were gay! [Slaps] (music)[Ends] [Door Closes] (music)[Woman Singing] (music)[Continues] (music)[Continues] - [Sighs] - [Dr. Perkins] Mrs. Valdessecchi... if Danny misses any more tests, we won't be able to proceed with the operation. - (music)[Continues] - Thank you for calling, Doctor. [Screams] Give me that! Check 'em. Check. Let's go. Check up top. [Chattering] - No, no, no! - [Screams] Right in your face! Mama, relax. I'll find him, okay? (music)[Ends] - Let's play some horse. - We'll take all your money. - Danny boy, you up for a game of horse? - Yep. Check it out. The blind guy shoots first. And there's no dunking. - You understand? - How do I know he's blind? Because, you low-budget Shaquille O'Neal... - everyone knows he's blind. - How original. What are you, an eye specialist? What are you talkin' about, boy? [Jay] Because, Sasquatch, everyone in the neighborhood knows he's blind. [Man #2] Let's do it. - 'Cause he is. - Yeah, right. What are you, a wise guy or something? Give me that. - Hey, Jay, you smell that? - What's that, D? - Smells like ass, man. - What? - [Grunts] - Hey! Hey! Big man! Like hittin' a blind kid? - Hey, you all right, buddy? - Like that, big man? Huh? You like that? - Huh? - Who's your daddy? - [Danny] Get him, Larry.! - Get... Let go of me, man! - Who's your daddy? - Go get him, Larry! - [Man] Huh? What's up? - Help, man! - Let him go! Put him down! - Jay, come on! Why haven't you been going to the doctor, Danny? Hmm? [Sighs] All right. Danny, just tell me what the problem is. - I promise you it's not as bad as you think. - [Scoffs] I don't understand you anymore, man. This operation is something for you. You understand that? Something to make your life better. Why... Why would you want to ruin that? Huh? I'm gonna be right by the car making calls if you need me, all right? [Children Chattering, Laughing In Background] - Danny, hi. - Hi. Do you have her chart? - Here you are, Doctor. - Thank you. I'll tell Dr. Perkins you're here. Yeah. Yeah, do that. Just, uh, tell him I'm here. 'Cause I'm here. [Dr. Perkins] Danny, I need to know... that you still feel positive about this operation. I tell you what. Why don't you see Dr. Evans one more time. She'll give us her assessment. We take it from there. [Chattering] Danny, wait. Look. Can we go to the park and talk? I never really explained myself too well. What's to explain? You're getting married. Danny, please. Danny. Danny, please. Danny, there's something else I should have told you before. Oh, Jesus. You're carrying his child? No! I haven't even slept with him. I haven't slept with anyone ever. Join the club. Danny, I'm Indian. It's hard to explain what that means to someone who isn't Indian. It's a different world. It's a different culture. This guy's Indian too, right? Yeah, he is. And when I asked you if you loved him, you couldn't answer me. My family's concept of love isn't what you think it is. It's got to do with duty and loyalty and responsibility... To who? Danny, I can't go against my family. I can't break a promise I've made. I'm sorry. And it's got nothing to do with you being blind. Who knows? When you can see... you might not like me anyway. I'm not an American beauty. I've got to go. [Danny] Did I do something wrong? Oh, no, Danny. Falling in love with someone who's already engaged is not a crime. Yeah, but it's a crime for her falling in love with me? Is that what it is? No. The falling in love is completely natural. I mean, we don't even have control over it. - So then maybe it's like manslaughter. - L-I don't understand. When you... When you do something, and you don't really mean it. No. No, falling in love is... is the most wonderful thing in the whole world. Yeah. - Yeah, I guess so. - [Sighs] Are you naked today, Dr. Evans? No. [Swallows] No, but I'd like to be. [Chuckles] Dr. Sato, we can do this. I think it's impossible. He's missed too many tests. He is obviously not committed. We have enough time to finish those tests before the operation. I promise you this boy is committed. Most of us live our lives viewing it from the outside in. Danny experiences his world from the inside out. That's his strength. He is more than capable of dealing with traumatic change. And of coping with the outcome of the operation, whatever that may be. [Woman On P. A] Dr. Patron to Neurology. Dr. Patron to Neurology. [Switch Clicks] [Elevator Bell Dings] - I'm here if you need me. - Thank you. [Sighs] What? Is my baby gonna be all right? He's gonna be just fine. Good. 'Cause if anything should happen to him, there's gonna be a lot of shouting... down here and in heaven. Hey. You're a good mother. And you got a good boy. Nothing's gonna happen to him. No one's gonna have to shout. You know? [Monitor Beeping] Yeah, sure. Uh, I could be there at like 9:30. [Woman] Drape is ready. - [Dr. Perkins] Are the leads... - [Woman] In place. [Monitor Beeping] [Woman] Sub-retinal prosthesis is standing by. All readings stable. [Woman, Indistinct] - [Whirring] - [Woman] Pneumatic pressure up. Mrs. Valdessecchi... Excuse me. Danny came through surgery beautifully. - [Sighs] - He's doing very, very well. - So when can we see him? - When he wakes up. And we start our tests as soon as he's strong enough. [Monitor Beeping] [Woman On P.A.] Nurse Owens to O.R. 2. Nurse Owens to O.R. 2. - How are we doing? - Let's do this. All right. Now you're going to feel a little pressure. Okay? - Mm-hmm. - You all right? Fine. Thank you. I'm putting on the glasses now. And when the time is right... you take all the time you need... I'm going to turn on the power to the camera. - But you let me know. - Mm-hmm. - I'm ready. - Good man. We're gonna do this on the count of three. All right? - Mm-hmm. - One... - two and three. - [High-pitched Charge] - All right. Tell me what's happening. - [Groans] - What's happening? - What is it, Danny? Ah, it just hurts a little bit. There's, um... There's... There's... There's something, uh, here. There are... things... Things? Phosphenes. Probably phosphenes. This... This is an indication that the visual cortex is being stimulated. It's not all black anymore. It's, uh... Is there a... There's something here, like a... square? - Square? Square? - It's a... - Danny, that's a window. - [Dr. Evans Laughs] - You're looking at a window.! - Stop. Something moved. Something moved. That's me! That's me! You just saw me in front of the window! Well, Dr. Sato, you lead the way. - It's a good start. - [Laughs] - Not bad. It feels like a roller coaster. - [All Laugh] - Let's get you home. - Well done. [Murmuring] All right. You're good. Okay. Are you ready? - Uh, yeah, yeah. - Here we go. - [High-pitched Charge] - [Groaning] - Hi, baby. - Hi, Mom. [Gasps] - Guess who. - [Laughs] Pop. [Father Sniffling, Sobbing] What's up, ugly? [Laughing] Come here. - [Sobbing] - Come here. - Where's Jay? - Right here, man. - What's up? - Huh? Yo, you rock, man. I'm proud of you, man. [Sighs, Laughs] I'm so proud of you, Danny. - Guess it works. - [Laughter] - This is tweed, huh? - [Laughter Continues] Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life. But what about us? We'll always have Paris. [Continues, Indistinct] - [Marie] Danny? - Yeah? - You okay? - Yeah. Come here. I want to show you something. [Man On TV] I've got a job to do too. Where I'm going, you can't follow. What I've got to do, you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems... of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. - It's you. - [Man On TV] Someday you'll understand that. - (music)[TV: Instrumental] - [Laughs] - [Gasping] - Danny? Danny! - [Groaning] - Mom! Danny? Mom! All right. That's right. Good constriction. That's good. Shoulders to your ears. Right. Yeah. Yeah. (music)[Man Singing Folk, Faint] Leeza. - That doesn't sound Indian. - No. You really like her, don't you? You're in love with her. Yeah. - Guess so. - Well, have you told her? No. I didn't get a chance. (music)[Indian] It is the date chosen by the Vedic astrologer... as the most auspicious date for the wedding. - To avoid any calamity. - Are you in agreement with that? Sure. The 28th is as good a date as any. - [Train Whistle Blows] - We are at the dawn of a new procedure. And we're having to learn as we go. But remember, you and I wouldn't be standing here talking right now... if it wasn't for brave young men like Danny... who take on the risks of experimental surgery... and pave the way for all those who follow. - Is the camera here yet? - Yeah. Close in tight. I smell an Emmy. - There's a lot of people... - Hi, Danny. Hey, thanks for taking our interview today. - How you doing? - Sure. Fine. Danny, why don't you take a walk down the street or throw a ball or something? Yeah, um, I have to turn it on first. Oh, no, no, no. The kid's not gonna do any action without a contract. - Okay, people? - I'm sorry. Who are you? Uh, I'm... I am, um, uh, Lorenzo Valdessecchi. I'm his brother and his manager. - [High-pitched Charge] - And I run Lorenzo's Limos. If any of you people want the ride of a lifetime, just call... - [Gasps] - Lorenzo's... - [All Gasping, Murmuring] - [Woman] Are you getting this? Call an ambulance! [Dr. Perkins] We gave it our best shot... but it's obviously affecting his brain, and we can't take any chances... so the prosthesis must come out first thing tomorrow. Now there is a chance... that the prosthesis might have moved. So Danny must lie very still. And he must not use those glasses anymore. [Woman On TV] Hi, Danny. Hey, thanks for taking our interview today. - Leeza, the Bhats are gonna be here any minute. - [Continues, Indistinct] - Leeza? Leeza? ...throw a ball or something. - Lorenzo's Limos... - [Father] Danny! - [Woman] Are you getting this? - [Father] Call an ambulance! (music)[Man Singing Folk, Faint] Danny, how you doing? Pretty good. Got another headache? I don't know if it's another one or the same one that hasn't gone away. It's more than just a headache or the operation, ain't it? It's a girl. I thought I'd be so busy seeing the world, you know, that I'd forget about her. [Sighs] But I just can't get her out of my mind, Pop. "Tu sol comandi, amor. ' That's what Mimi sings in La Boheme. "Love, only you alone guide us. ' I guess you just gotta give it some time. How much time? Don't ask me. I only ever loved your mother. I would've waited a thousand years for her. - To family. - Cheers. (music)[Indian] Ooh. Hope it fits.

[Woman] There they are. Hey, guys. [Vehicle Approaches] [Brakes Hiss] - When does the next bus to North Central come? - You're lookin' at it. I'm sorry. I had some bad news about a friend. Well, we mustn't let that stop the festivities. To wonderful food and beautiful people. Buddy, here we are. Welcome to downtown North Central. You know where the Crimson Elephant is? - Uh, no, never heard of it. What street's it on? - Wall Street. Right. Just go right through this courtyard right over here. About 1:00. Go straight through there. You'll run right into it. - Okay. Thank you. - Good luck. Watch your step. [High-pitched Charge] [Women Chattering] That's weird. [People Chattering, Murmuring] - [Man Whoops] - [Men Shouting] - Look out, bitch! - [Grunts] - What's the matter with you, kid? - Sorry. Sorry. Didn't see you. I'm tryin' to sleep.

I had to see you. It's my last chance to see you. But... [Panting] It's no good. They're not working anyway. - [Glasses Land On Floor] - And it doesn't matter because... I've already seen you. I've seen your face. I've seen your eyes. I've seen your lips and your hair. I've seen everything, and you are beautiful. - This is not good! - Shh! You remember when you tried to tell me what your family thought about love? Well, let me tell you what I think love is. Love is how you speak to me. You have a softness in your voice that... And love is how you touch me... and guide me, showing me the way to go. And when we kiss... When we kiss... it moves me to my soul. - [Groans] - Danny! - [Groaning Continues] - Danny? Dad? [Siren Wailing] [Monitor Beeping] It's coming out right now. Right now. Okay. [Weeping] [Woman On P.A.] Dr. Davis. Dr. Davis, please. Hi. I'm Danny's brother. Hi.

[Monitor Beeping] Freddie Possani. - Anna Voldano. [Laughs] - What's that, Danny? - Pepi Nova. - Who are these people, Danny? Kids in my first grade class.

Stop talking like that! - Morning, ugly. - We're not like this all the time. - [Laughter] Is Leeza here? I'm right here, Danny. She is so beautiful. - Aw! - She's wearin' a curtain. [All Shouting] I just wanna tell you that I'm sorry about what I said the other day, you know, about... you choosing the other guy 'cause I'm blind. - That came out of a total moment where l... - It's okay. It's okay. You know, l-I'm also sorry that you split up with him... and that you'll probably never see him again. - I mean, I'm not all that... - Stop. Stop apologizing. Are you wearing jasmine? [Danny Narrating] So like I said, things are going pretty well for me. And Leeza and I are finding out about each other and our different cultures. And so are our families. (music)[Dance] [Laughter] (music)[Continues] They both go well together, yes? What are you gonna do? I'm sure you'll like it. - You think you could do that? - Maybe. Oh, my God. You are like a lily pad in the sunshine. - Hey, Larry, Suzie, what's going on? - We're lookin' at Kama Sutra. Jay, these Indians... They know how to party, man. Get real. [Scoffs] (music)[Continues] [Laughing] - [Laughing] - [Laughs] Pop, you gotta watch this. Ow! - [Camera Shutter Clicks] - In my life, I've always needed the help... of dear friends and dear family. My brother, Larry, has been both. He's been my best friend and my brother. Well, just as a token of everything he's done for me over the years... - I want to give him this. - Yes, sir. - Aw. - [Cheering] - Thank you. I love you, bro. - I love you too. - Doesn't look like a new limousine. - That's right. [Laughter, Cheering] [Gagging] All right, dancing party, everybody! Come on! (music)[Dance] Whee!
