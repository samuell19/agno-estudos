MAN (on radio): Already up to 71 degrees this morning in the valley. People still buzzing around town about the West Virginia Mountaineers' big victory this past weekend. You can look for another sunny day this Saturday's game. Looks like this warm-weather trend will stay with us for at least another week. Temperatures are expected to stay in the mid- to high 70s. Yesterday's high was a record setter for West Virginia. High temperatures are affecting the entire East Coast area. Let's hope the weatherman can keep winter away for as long as possible and keep those heating bills down. (knocks on door) All yours, Dad. ANNOUNCER: Every half hour on the half hour, we have the latest weather and traffic and news. Don't touch that dial. We're your station to keep you informed. Here, honey. Thanks. Mama, he's taking all the cereal. Peter, save some for Crystal. There ain't enough, Mama. It's his second bowl. I didn't get even one. Mama, did you read it? Yes, I did, last night. And? Well, I'm no critic... MAN: Little racy, ain't it? CHILDREN: Morning, Daddy. Good morning. It's just a story. It's not autobiographical or nothing. Well, praise the Lord and pass the toast. MAMA: Kathy was telling me they got a course down at Langley Junior College on creative writing. Right. Now, my understanding is is if you want to go to college, you got to first graduate high school. MAMA: Now, honey, this is what they call an extension course. KATHY: Right. Anybody can sign up. Even dropouts? Excuse me, I have to finish getting ready. We're leaving in five minutes, missy. Yes, Daddy. I saw that, Petey. I'm going to get you some coffee. (machine roaring) (crash) (giggling) DADDY: You seen my flannel jacket? KATHY: Um... last time I saw it, it was hanging on the hook by the door. Yeah, well, it ain't there now, and I'm cold. Hell, it must be 75 in the sun, Tom. TOM: Yeah, that don't matter. I'm cold. You come across it, you bring it in here, okay? You bet. You know what I always figured about writers, Kathy? Writers got to be pretty smart. I'm smart. Yeah, but you made some bad choices. Dropping out of high school was one of them. We been through all that before. I just don't like waste is all. Sometimes I feel you're wasting your life with some... bad choices. Like what? I expect more from you. You see my flannel jacket, you let me know, hear? (crickets chirping) Aren't you having a good time? Sure. Jimmy Daniel, you look at me. Come on, come here. I got no hook in you, honey. I ain't fishing for no man, especially not a married one. I know. So why don't you just sit back... and relax... and have a good time? That's all I want. (humming tune) Mama! What, darling? My journal-- it's missing, and Crystal's got it. Now, what makes you think that Crystal wants to steal your journal? Because she's a nosy little brat, that's why! Now, you just calm down. I'll talk to her. She'll deny it! She always does! It's gone for a couple of days, and then miraculously it reappears and she acts like nothing happened. I got no privacy in this house. Daddy still treats me like I'm 12 years old! All right, now, sit down. Come on. Mama... Come on, come on, come on. Now it's not unusual for some daddies to have a tough time watching their daughters grow up. I'm going to leave. One way or the other, I'm going to get my own place and have my own privacy. Kathy, honey, you're still working for your daddy, and jobs being what they are down here, I don't think you're going to find something that pays enough for rent and groceries. I got some saved. Enough? Enough? Hmm? Not yet maybe. All right, then. You just slow down. Just talk to him, okay? I will. I promise. Now, why don't you go inside and take a nice hot bath? There ain't nobody around here to bother you. You got your privacy. Thanks, Mama. Okay, baby. You're missing The Waltons. I've seen that one. So? So? So? (Tom chuckles) Get out of... (door opens) Hi, guys. CHILDREN: Hi, Kathy. Your supper's in the oven. Got your mom to thank for it. I'm sorry I'm late. TOM: It used to be families sat down together for their evening meal. I'm sorry, Daddy. (kisses) (growling playfully) (giggling) (Tom and kids laughing) You should've called home. You know how your daddy likes us all together for supper. How can they do that in there? All three of them like a bunch of kids at the matinee. I don't know. They're quiet, and that's all I care about. How's your pot roast? Good-- always is. Mama? Hmm? You ever get the feeling somebody's watching you? Why? I don't know-- just the last few weeks, I get the feeling somebody's watching me, following me. I... just tonight... Someone's following you? Well, I don't know. Maybe not. I know who it is. TOM: Who? It's that Buford boy. All through your junior year, he called here three, four times a day. Mama, he's going with Janet Kilgore. That don't matter. You were his first love. First loves last forever. Now, you tell him to get on with his life-- go with the flow. Where did you ever hear that? A magazine. It was story about this... this leaf going down a mountain creek, and just by going with the flow, it reached the waters of peace and tranquillity. See, the message here... Mama, I understand the message. I think you been reading too much, sugar. PETER: Daddy, you're hogging all the popcorn. Oh, you want it, you're going to have to fight me for it. ( Tom and kids screaming playfully ) Sometimes I think I got me two boys instead of one. Eat. (dog barking in distance) (shivering) You okay, baby? Turn up that heat like I asked? Mm-hmm, 75, just like you said. Sometimes I get so cold. Oh, I know, honey. There, is that better? Yeah. Tom, we got to talk about Kathy. Now, I know you don't want to face it but it's a God-given fact, she's growing up. And unless you accept that, we're going to lose her. We already have. No, we haven't. But she needs her freedom, Tom. Freedom from what? We're her family. Course we are. But, now, you're down there in that lot with all those cars for sale, and she's got to rely on you or me to get her across town. Well, you just can't win for losing. When I was a kid, I would have given anything to be taken care of like that little girl is. Yeah, but this isn't about you or me. It's about Kathy, your daughter. You sure have got determined in your old age. Hey, give me my family, I know what to do. You put me out there and I'm lost. That's why I got you in my life. I'll see what I can do. You promise? I promise. (tires squealing) The prettiest picture I ever saw. I like the way you got the trees reflecting there. Can we frame it? You bet. TOM: Kathy! Kathy. Wait till your daddy sees this. (giggles) Kathy upstairs? MAMA: No, honey, she comes home with you. Why'd she be upstairs? Well, she ain't called? No. What's the matter? Daddy, look what I drew. Yeah, not now, Crystal. Go inside with your brother. Go ahead, now. What's going on? I got a call from some boy up in Saget. He got a red Chevy pickup he wants to sell and I'm thinking maybe this is for Kathy. A pickup? She didn't come by? She didn't show you? No, I'd have told you. Well, then, where is she? Well, I don't know. Why ain't she with you? That's what I'm getting to. This boy can't figure out directions to the yard, so I tell him we'll meet him up by Bobby Rigg's up on Highway 6. Mm-hmm. So we meet there and he and Kathy go off for a test drive. You didn't go with her? It was just a test drive, and she was so excited and... well, I waited and then I just... I just figured maybe she drove home. And now I don't know where she is. Tom, just calm down. She's probably so excited, she's driven all the way to New York. Now, I'm going to get supper on, and when I do, she's going to come bouncing in here. You'll see. MAMA: You can leave the light on, but no talking, now, okay? PETER: Good night, Mama. CRYSTAL: Good night. Good night, babies. You talked to Jo Beth? (sighs) Jo Beth, Polly, that boy Sam down at the hardware store. Ain't nobody seen her. I'm going to ask Betty to stay with the kids. We are going to find her. (whispering): Come on, come on, come on. There's red. Yeah, but it's a Chevy. It's a Chevy. (police radio transmissions) (car doors opening, closing) So, the last time you saw her, they were headed north? TOM: That's right, sir, right up that way. CAROL: Sergeant Jackson, it's already been over 12 hours. Mrs. Acton, I've already sent out an APB on the red Chevy and we have a description out on the man. But you should know that your daughter's not officially missing for another... ten hours. I'm sorry, I don't understand. JACKSON: 24 hours, ma'am. Now, if she were underage, that's something else again. What difference does age make? Your daughter's 19, and sometimes, young people... spend the night out. TOM: No. No, no. No, no. Not Kathy. See, we have rules and... and she respects them. Yes, sir, I understand. What if they was in a accident? Ma'am, we're going to do everything we can. Mr. Acton... why don't you take your wife home? CAROL: No. We're going to keep on looking. JACKSON: No, ma'am, we're going to look. Please. Come on, honey. Let's do as the man says. Come on, they'll fd her. You'll see. Come on. I still think that we should talk to the Buford boy again. What? Kathy said somebody was following her. CRYSTAL: I'm scared, Mama. Oh, now, sugar, it's going to be all right. Don't you worry. Why would somebody follow Kathy? Now... we don't know that anybody was following her. Tom. I want you two dressed. We ain't going to school. I don't care. You don't spend your day around here looking like that. Come on. Mama... CAROL: Come on, honey. (gruffly): Now! Come on. It's okay. (door closing) Honey... now, this is hard on... on everybody, and we're all going to look to you to get us through this, now. Fact of the matter is, none of this would've happened if you hadn't... (sighs) If I hadn't what? Forget it. If I hadn't what? (gruffly): Everything was fine. We had rules, order. Kathy left with me, she came home with me. And that was right. She was going to leave us, Thomas. How?! You were the one who said she should have more freedom, she should have her own car. How could you say that to me? (Tom grumbles) Where are you going? Jim McDaniel. He knows where she is. Why would Jim know? They was having an affair. Jim McDaniel is a married man. They was having an affair! What are you talking about? I told her: "Don't let your mama know." "Don't let your mama know..." Tom... Tom! (engine roaring) (dogs barking in distance) Where is she? What? I know what was going on between you two. Where is she? What the hell you talking about? (gruffly): Where is she? Think I don't know? You think your wife don't know? Take it easy, Tom! Geez! Now, you tell me where she is and we'll forget this whole thing ever happened. Where who is? You got her shacked up someplace? K-Kathy's gone? You tell her she got to call me, you understand? I don't got her, Tom, I swear, I don't. W-w-when... When did...? You tell her this is a terrible thing to be doing to her mother and me. (breathing raggedly) You tell her... she's to set an example for her brother and her sister. She knows that. I don't got her, Tom. You tell her I forgive her. I forgive her. (vacuum droning) Honey, I can take the kids on over to my place. No, thank you. You know, I'd be glad to watch them for you. (shuts vacuum off) I said no, thank you. I'm... I'm sorry. I just... I don't know what to do with myself. My chores are done, and maybe I should... I don't know what to do with myself. Oh, honey. Everything is going to be just fine... Shh. Don't say that. That's what I tell the kids, and I'm afraid I'm lying to them. Carol. Maybe I just should have left well-enough alone. You know, Betty, there's some things I'm good at, there's some stuff I can do, but maybe... Carol, now, don't do this to yourself. Now, you know my cousin Sandra, right? Well, she left home for a whole week once when she but 17, and she didn't tell her folks a thing. I'm afraid to let Petey and Crystal out of the house. Now, Carol... No. Kathy told me she was afraid somebody was following her. What if they is after my other kids, too? (moans softly) (no voice) (ducks quacking) (river burbling) (ducks quacking) ( fishing lure rustling in leaves ) (fishing reel clicking) (police radio transmissions) What you got? Young white female. She was shot at close range. We don't know how many times yet, but it was more than enough to get the job done. This the girl? Man, we can't tell. She don't even have a face left. (dog barking in distance) ( knock at door; video game beeping ) Detective Jackson. JACKSON: May I come in? Sure. Any news? Kids, why don't you go upstairs? CAROL: Why? Why do they have to go upstairs? (softly): Go on, now. Yeah, all right, come on. Do as the man says. Go ahead. Good girl. Close your door. Why don't we all sit down? I'll make us some coffee. No, ma'am. Well, I don't have any sweet rolls, but I could toast us some bread. TOM: We're going to sit now. (softly): Come on. Sit down. JACKSON: Thank you. This morning we received a phone call from a fisherman over at Copper's Head River. What he found was a... What we discovered was the body of a young female. She was found floating in the river, naked except for underwear. She'd been shot several times. We need your identification. I don't think I can do that. The only reason I have this picture is to save you from having to go down to the morgue. Will you stop now? I can't, ma'am. I'm sorry. Mr. Acton, it's either here or downtown. And believe me, you don't want to go downtown. (Tom moaning) It's not her. What? It's not Kathy. Carol, honey-- it ain't Kathy. Look. Oh, my God. My precious Lord. It's not her, is it? Tell him. Tell him, honey. No... no. CAROL: It can't be. Are you sure? I know my own daughter. My husband's right. Whoever this girl is, God rest her soul. This ain't my daughter. That ain't my daughter. I'm sorry. Careful. Petey, you stop right there. Now, you stay close to me, you hear? Yes, Mama. Hi, Betty. Hi. I called you this morning-- you already left. Yeah, we was out driving around, hoping maybe we'd see something. Carol, honey? My boy just told us about Kathy. I'm awful sorry, but I'm sure everything's going to be all right. It is? I'm mighty glad to hear that. Now, Carol... she means well. Nothing like this has ever happened to us before. Me neither. Remember? Petey? Peter? Crystal? Petey? Petey... Petey! Peter! Peter, I told you... Where's Crystal? I don't know, Mama. I told you to stay with me, now, didn't I? Didn't I? Now, calm down, people are noticing. Have you seen Crystal? I thought she was with you. You thought! Crystal? Crystal, didn't I tell you to be where I could see you? We're sorry, Mama, stop it! PETER: Just stop. I'm sorry, honey. I just... Mama needs you right now, baby. I just... I got to know where you are all the time now, both of you. Okay? Okay, Mama. Okay. I love you. Father. (clippers snipping) Mr. Acton? (door hinge creaks) Mrs. Acton? I don't know what to do; he's been out there for hours now. He won't come in, he won't answer me. Why don't you wait inside for a while? Yes, sir. I'm the same way. Once I start a project, I can't stop till it's done. Why don't you come on inside, Mr. Acton? (meekly): I can't come in till I'm finished. Well, I... I think it's okay. We'll just take a little break, okay? (meekly): You think? Sure. You ever try making one of those ships in a bottle? I sent away for one of those kits. Spent the whole weekend trying to figure it out. My wife had to drag me to bed. Next morning, she threw the damn thing out. You mind if I leave this on? Sure. Sure, that's fine. Why don't you sit down? Both of you. The photo I showed you of the young female... That's got nothing to do with us, Mr. Jackson. JACKSON: Ma'am, I'm afraid that's not so. We made a positive identification. Fingerprints. Are you sure? Yes, ma'am. It's a lie. It's a lie, it's a mistake. Kathy's alive. She's out there someplace and she needs me. Kathy! (sobbing): Honey, Daddy's here for you, honey! Kathy, Daddy's waiting for you. Kathy... Kathy! (sobbing) Kathy, Kathy... Kathy... (sobbing) Kathy... (thunder rumbling) MAN (faintly): You bastard. What? MAN (faintly): Look at you. (man laughs) Who's there? Here's your softie, honey. Want me to leave the light on? Yes, ma'am. Okay. PETER: Mama? Mm-hmm? I can't sleep with the light on. Well, you just close your eyes, Petey. It's always dark behind your eyelids. CRYSTAL: Mama? Hmm? The closet. I already checked the closet, Crystal. Thought I heard something. Okay. Anybody in there, you better come out right now, or you're going to have to answer to me. Anybody? Nobody's in there. Hey, now... I'm going to leave the light on and the door open. Okay? Okay, Mama. Okay. Now, you want anything, you just holler. I'm just going to be right out here. I'm not going anywhere. Good night, Mama. Good night, baby. I love you both. (whispers): Love you. (rain pattering on roof) (thunder crashes) JACKSON: Okay, this man, John, says he wants to sell his truck. He's coming down Highway 12. He'll meet you in an hour. That's right. Lot of folks try to sell their cars through Tom-- they know he'll give them a good deal. Okay, if it's going to take him an hour to get there, that places him in one of three possible towns. He said Saget. Well, we're checking registrations, traffic citations, repair shops. Got a composite based on your description. Well, somebody's got to know him. Well, ma'am, we hope so. Well, we're going out looking, too. Uh... I'm not so sure that's a good idea. I can identify the truck. I should be out looking. We're going to cover every town from here to the Virginia border. I understand your wish to help. It's no wish. It's what's going to keep us alive. Now, whoever did this, we want him caught. And if you find him, so be it. But if you don't, by God, we will. If you see... MAN: Got you. Would you take a look? Here, ma'am, thank you. WOMAN: I'm so sorry. JACKSON: Do you remember seeing a gentleman here, approximately five-ten, 165 pounds... (continues talking quietly) Approximately 18, 19 years old... (talking quietly) TOM: Do you know anyone else who has a truck like this? (continues talking quietly) Sorry. JIMMY: I was a fool, Mr. Jackson, but I don't see what the heck I'm guilty of. My wife forgave me, and I'm trying to do the same. (river rushing) (hawk calling) (knocking) Ma'am. May I come in? Well, Tom ain't home right now. I know. Oh. (timer bell dings) Uh... would you come in the kitchen with me, please? Can I get you a cup of coffee? No. No, ma'am. Tom and I thought we saw a red pickup, but it just turned out... Ma'am... I can't even begin to imagine what you must be going through. But I owe it to you to be honest and forthright. Yes, sir. Starting with the convenience store, no one there remembers seeing your husband, your daughter or the red pickup. Yeah, that's because they was out by the air pumps, and there are no windows on that side. Yes, ma'am, but there's more. Any truck registered in the county matching the description has been followed up on, leading nowhere. Well, we don't know if it was registered in this county or not, do we? Then there's Mr. McDaniel. You talked to Jim? Yes, ma'am. He's clean. Well, that just leaves the man in the red pickup, then, the man that called my husband. Mrs. Acton... we have a complete description of a man who doesn't seem to exist. A phantom truck. No record at the phone company of any call coming in at the time your husband says it did. Well, Mr. Jackson... No call. No truck. No witnesses. No man. Which leads me to only one conclusion. What's that? That there is a suspect in this case. Unfortunately the suspect happens to be... your husband. I want you to leave my house. Mrs. Acton... You leave my house right now! Look, Mrs. Acton, I know this is hard for you... Hard? Just because you can't do your job, you're going to tell me that the man I've loved for the last 20 years, the father of my children, a man who'd give his life for his family... Most murders in this country are committed by people who know one another, people from the same family. Get out. Mrs. Acton, for your safety and for the safety of your children-- for the safety of your children-- you've got to know that your husband may be responsible for your daughter's death. I know Tom Acton. He's a good man. But you're an evil one. I'm telling you for the last time: You get out. I'm sorry... but I advise you to be careful. (knock at door) (door lock buzzes) You go with him, Mr. Acton. Why? Where... where's he going? It's okay. He's going to be fine. Sorry about this morning's paper. I had nothing to do with it. (mutters) Well, uh, tell my children, Mr. Jackson. How do I explain that to them? Please. What are you doing with Tom? I want him in here. They're just asking him a few questions. Well, why can't I be with him? You got some questions, you can ask me. How would you describe your husband's relationship with his daughter? This is crazy. I lived with that man for over 20 years. Yes, ma'am... And we've been through terrible, terrible times, and he's gotten us through them. He provided for us. (under breath): "Describe a 20-year relationship" is a stupid question. It's just stupid. His relationship with Kathy. Did you notice anything... I'm through talking to you. Well, I'm not through, Mrs. Acton. You know, I'm not a smart woman, but I've done some reading. And unless I'm mistaken, you got to charge me with something if you want to keep me here. (chuckles): Look... Ma'am, I'm not charging you with anything... Well, then I'm going. And unless you're charging my husband, I'm taking him with me. Mrs. Acton! He drove off and... Come on, Tom. Come on, now. CAROL: Come on, now. We're going home. We're going to do your job for you. We're going to find that pickup that Kathy took off in, and when we do, we'll be happy to accept your apology. Hey, babies. Thanks for watching them, Betty. Come on, now. Come on. Didn't you hear your mama? My boy just told me what happened at school today. What? BETTY: Well, you know kids. You know, they heard all the news by now. Well, some of their friends was teasing them. They were saying that... that their daddy was a killer and they ought to sleep with one eye open. (quietly): My God. No, I'll do it. I'll go, I'll go. I'll go, Tom. (quietly): I'm sorry. Now, whatever they told you, that was a lie. This is your daddy. Okay? And he needs us. Now, whenever you been hurt and you need your daddy, he's always been there for you, hadn't he? Yes, ma'am. Mm-hmm. Who takes you fishing, Petey? Who taught you how to ride a bike and tie your shoes? Daddy. That's right. Now, it's just the four of us now, and there's a lot of people trying to tear us apart, but I'm not going to let them. Will you? No, ma'am. Now, I want you to let your daddy know how much you love him and that you're going to be there for him, now. Okay? All right, you go on, now. TOM (gruffly, in distance): I don't let nobody talk back to me, ever! Tom? TOM (gruffly, in distance): You embarrass me. TOM (meekly, in distance): I'm sorry... (meekly): Yes, sir. CAROL: Tom? Tommy, what is it? What? What's the matter? Why aren't you in bed? Who... who were you just talking to? Talking to? I wasn't talking to nobody. Well... well, I just heard you. It must have been Sweeney and his boy going at it again, hmm? Probably. Why don't you come back to bed, honey? It's awful cold out here. Is it? Yeah, sure it is. Come on, now. Come on. CRYSTAL: Come here. Going to have her babies any day now. What are we going to do with them? We ain't going to eat them, are we? Of course not, for heaven's sake. We're going to make key chains out of them. Shut up, Peter. CRYSTAL: Come here. Come here, little guy. CRYSTAL: Come on. Take a bite, come here. This here's supposed to be good for you. Now, come here. Mrs. Acton? Ma'am. WOMAN: I'm Susan Banks from the Department of Child Welfare. I'm here to pick up your children. What? Didn't they call? We have a court order to remove the children from the premises, ma'am. I don't understand. When there's a suspicion of child abuse... Child abuse? BANKS: In the case of your husband being under suspicion. Ma'am, we have us a court order... CAROL: I don't give a damn what you got. You get off my property. Crystal, Petey, you go inside now, you lock the door... They'll be just fine. (yelling, crying) Let go of me! (yelling) Mama! Mama! Where are we going, ma'am? Look, they ain't never been hurt here-- never, never. CAROL: I swear to God: My kids ain't never been hurt here! I'm just doing my job, Mrs. Acton. It's for your kids' own sake. I swear, he's never touched those kids! You ask them. Ask them. He never laid a hand on them! Ask them! Now, look... look, now, listen to me. You leave them here... Move away from the car! CAROL: You leave them here and I won't let anybody near them, not even their daddy! Oh, please don't take my babies. (crying and shouting) They're all I got! Don't take them, oh, please! Oh, God. You've got no right! They're my kids! They're all I got! Oh, God, please! God, no! (sobbing) Oh, God! What's going on? Oh, God! Honey! What the hell's going on? Don't you touch me! They're taking my kids away from me, and everybody says it's because of you! Everybody says it but me. But I'm the one who's losing everything! I want my kids back, Tom Acton! And until I get them, you stay the hell away from me! You stay away! (sobbing) What are you doing here, Mrs. Acton? They won't let me see them. Yeah. It's by court order. I would never hurt my children. What's in the bags? Crystal can't go to sleep without her softie, and I got Petey's baseball cards and stuff they need, stuff they're used to. Come on. Let's go. (sighs) (knocks on door) Yes? Ma'am, I'm Detective Jackson. You called the station? Well, I saw her standing outside for the longest time, and I was... It's okay, ma'am. This is Mrs. Acton. I just brought some of their stuff... Mama! Oh, my God. (crying and laughing) Let me look at you, now. You okay? Sure. Are we going home? Well, not just yet, honey, but I brought you some stuff, okay? Look. (giggles) (whispering): Yeah, yeah. Um... I got Daddy to give up his Pete Rose. Thank you. JACKSON: Mrs. Acton. Okay, now. Don't you be no bother. You be good, now. Okay. They're good kids. Oh, yes, ma'am. I know. WOMAN (whispering): All right, let's go. (crying): Mama... (car shuts off) Where you been? I been scared. What are you scared of, Tom? Being alone. Thinking maybe you left me. Why would I do that? I don't know. I never left you before, have I? Even after everything we've been through. Even when we was living in a tent. And I promised you, someday we'd have our own house. And I made good on that promise, didn't I? Yes, I did. Tom... I got to ask you. And I want you to swear to me and God. I got to ask you. Did you harm Kathy in any way? You think I could do something like that? Tom, please. We have been through so much together. I just got to hear you swear. All my adult life I've done nothing but try to provide a home and love to you. And you hurt me. Tom... I can understand the kids-- they get scared. They don't know what to think. But I could always count on you. And you hurt me. Where are you going? I'm going to find her! I'm going to do what the rest of you can't do! I'm going to find her and I'm going to bring her home! Then you'll see! (truck starts up) (phone ringing) Hello. TOM (on phone): I found it! Tom? I found the truck she drove off in. CAROL (on phone): Well, where are you? I told you I'd find it. Where are you? TOM: I'm down at the old post office-- on 12. Truck's just down that old dirt road just past it. You know that sign that says... CAROL: Okay, listen, listen. I'll call Detective Jackson. We'll meet you there, okay? TOM: Oh, I'll meet you there. I'll meet you right there. And you tell Jackson I found it. I found it. I will. TOM: You tell him! I found it. Yes, you did. Yes, you did. Yeah, I found it. I found it. Tom! Tom Acton! CAROL: Tommy! This ain't no red Chevy pickup. This is one of his cars from the lot. You better take a look at this. CAROL: Oh, my God. (gasping) Oh, my... Ma'am, if you know where your husband is, you better tell me now. I... I don't know, I swear. I would never lie to you about a thing like that. Oh, my God, my children! What if he's after my children? Smitty, get on the box. I need two officers watching those kids now! I should be there, I'm their mama! Mrs. Acton, listen to me! Listen to me! Now, we're going to find him, but I can't do it without you. Okay? All right. Now, if that's his car... He drives lots of different cars. Well, what car would he be driving now? They're watching my children? Are you sure they're watching? Yes, ma'am, I'm sure. Your kids are going to be fine. Now, think. What would he be driving now? A camper. He took off in the camper. KATHY: How long is it going to be, Daddy? Where are we going? We're going where it's safe, baby. You got yourself in a mess. Daddy's going to have to take care of you. (police radio transmissions) (screen door hinges squeaking) CAROL: Thank you. (door bangs shut) He's gone, ain't he? Now, honey, you just don't know that. Petey and Crystal need me. Carol, they're fine. You just called them but ten minutes ago. Yeah, but they need me. We always loved it here. The quiet. Everybody at home. Everybody in their own bed saying good night to each other. Tom said it reminded him of The Waltons and how he always wanted his family to be like they was. It don't seem to have turned out that way. (whispering): Carol, baby... this ain't your fault. I don't know. Crystal! PETER: Crystal? WOMAN: Crystal! PETER: Crystal! Crystal, where are you? Go away! WOMAN: Oh, honey... baby... Go away! Crystal, what you doing out here? All I want is my mama and daddy. I miss Kathy. I know, and I do, too. CRYSTAL: I want to go home. PETER: So do I. (crying) KATHY: Daddy, it's too hot in here. You just go to sleep, honey. We got a long night ahead of us. KATHY: Daddy, I want to go home. I didn't mean the things I said. I know you didn't, honey. I know. (police radio transmissions) (taps glass) You okay, sir? What? Sir, are you all right? Do you need assistance? We're just fine, thank you. Little tired, that's all. You got somebody in there with you, sir? She needed some sleep. I'd appreciate it if you'd just let us be. Sir, would you open the door slowly, please, and step outside the vehicle? I'm cold. I hate the cold. (sharply): Sir-- step outside the vehicle, please. It's all right, darling. Daddy will take of everything. (reporters shouting) (cameras clicking, whirring) JACKSON: Back up, please! (reporters shouting) REPORTER: Mr. Acton! Your daughter's body was found on... JACKSON: He has no comment! REPORTER: Detective Jackson, are you going to push murder one on this? You'll have to ask the D.A. about that. REPORTER 2: Do think it was premeditated or an act of simple passion? (clamoring quiets) (gruffly): Nature has its laws, you know. "As ye sow, so shall ye reap." REPORTER 1: Mr. Acton, your daughter Kathy... REPORTER 2: Why did you kill her? (gruffly): Tom Acton did not kill his daughter! When are you folks going to understand that? REPORTER 2: Then who did? (gruffly): I did! I did it! (reporters quiet) (softly): Tom? (shouting resumes) REPORTER: Mrs. Acton? REPORTER 2: Mrs. Acton? REPORTER 3: Mrs. Acton? Dr. Miller will be conducting several interviews with your husband, some under hypnosis. Although M.P.D. is rather rare in men, I think we can plead a case. What's that-- M.P.D.? Multiple personality disorder-- it's as if there are several different people living inside the same body and... and they don't always know what each other's doing. Yeah, I... I think I've seen something. What? Well, I... I didn't know, you know, exactly what you'd call it, but... yeah, I think I seen him. Didn't you tell anybody? Tell them what? Mrs. Acton, I am trying to... Mr. Brandon, sir, my guess is that you come from a fine family, an educated family... Ma'am. Well, things are just a little bit different this side of the mountain, and when you're afraid that you... you can't feed your family and... and keep a roof over your kid's head or when you can't make that bill to keep everybody warm, you know, you tend to get a little upset, you get a little jumpy. I am talking about something else... No, no! We're talking about the same thing. I've seen his changes. I... I seen him turn into a little boy when he's playing with my son, and I... I watch his body go all stiff-like and heard a voice come from somewhere else, I don't know. Well, why didn't you...? Well, what would you have me do? Call the police because my man's moody? That man has kept the fear out of my life for the last 20 years. You look at us and you just see poor people. But you don't understand, sir, we're a success story. My kids got clean clothes, and we got decent food on the table, now-- something you can swallow. I'm sorry, sir, I just... I'm a mother and that's my job. I'm here to provide a life for my children, and I'm just trying to tell you, I couldn't have done it without my husband. Well, ma'am, your husband killed your daughter. I... I don't know who killed Kathy. I'm just telling you that I don't have a husband anymore, and I can't support the family I got left. I can't even see them. Now, when do I get my kids back? Until it is proven that you had nothing to do with either your daughter's murder or any abuse that might be found, Social Services won't have anything to do with... They think I was involved? Maybe I was. I was supposed to keep my kids safe... and I didn't do that. (knocking) Excuse us. Mrs. Acton... Please. Excuse us. You okay? No. It's... it's cold. You should've wore a coat. Maybe it's warmer sitting where you are. It don't matter, Tom. We've got to talk. There's a whole lot of things I don't understand. Kids okay? They're fine. And Kathy? How's my little princess? Please don't do this. I told her everything was going to be fine once we got home, and then you started... (quietly): Stop it! Do you know who I am? Do you know who you're talking to? Kathy's dead, and you killed her, and I want to know why! Why do you have to...? You listen to me! Don't talk to me like that. It scares me when you do that. You listen to me, now. You don't do this. You're in trouble, and you got to let these people help you. (gruffly): He's not going to get help from nothing. (gruffly): You sniveling bitch! Stop. (gruffly): Let me tell you something. All your sniveling at him ain't going to get you nowhere. It's your fault, you know? No. You let him get away with murder. No. I told him, "Hell, she don't care what you do, Thomas. She can't see past her nose." You stop that, now! You deserve each other, you know that? You're disgusting, both of you. Weak, sniveling... bitch! Bitch! GUARD: Hey, stop it, you! You bitch, I'll kill you and your daughter! Bitch, I'll put you with your daughter! I'll put you with her! (laughing insanely) (yelling) (sobbing) (police radio transmissions) (Tom shivering) BRANDON: This is her sixth session. He's under hypnosis. Yes. Any insights you can give me would be greatly... Shh. HYPNOTIST: Are you cold, Tom? TOM (meekly): Cold. It's very cold. Where are you, Tom? (shivering) (meekly): It's too cold. I could get you a jacket. I'm not supposed to have one. Why can't you have a jacket? (sighs) You don't understand nothing! How old are you, Tom? (meekly): I'm 13. I just turned 13. I got me a baseball mitt. (shivers) HYPNOTIST: But you're shivering. TOM: The grass is wet... from the frost. It's wet and it's cold. I'm supposed to cut it but I can't. You'll cut it tomorrow. You don't understand nothing. Yes, sir. Tom. Tom, what's he saying to you? Oh, God, he's mad now. Daddy! (gruffly): You dumb, stupid, ignorant boy. DADDY: And from now on, you're going to do exactly what I say. (screaming): Is that clear, boy? Maybe you just deaf and dumb. (meekly): No, Daddy. (mockingly): "No, Daddy." Well, you got to be... because nobody could be as dumb as you are unless there was something wrong in there! Please, Daddy. "Please, Daddy." Please what? (sniffs) Look at you. You know I'm embarrassed to be seen with you? Now, you get down on them hands and knees and you're going to cut this grass all night. And you ain't going to eat and you ain't going to sleep until every blade of grass is cut. You understand me, boy? Huh?! (clippers snipping) It's so cold. You stupid little bastard. Ooh, boy, come on. Come on, boy, you want to kill your daddy? Come on. Come on! Whoo-hee! Go ahead, boy. You got the guts? You got the guts to kill your daddy? Come on! You're a bastard. You're Mama's bastard! You ain't no son of mine. Make me want to puke. I'm fine, Mama. I'm fine. There's no problem. I'm fine. Aw, Tom, I... I'm fine. Daddy's right. I ain't worth wasting any time on. Daddy's right. (videotape pauses) HYPNOTIST: The boy spent the entire night on his hands and knees crawling through the wet grass, soaked to the skin. The boy that was Tom Acton ceased to be and someone else took over. Previous to this, I had witnessed several personalities emerge from Mr. Acton-- six, to be exact. I hadn't clearly understood the pecking order, however. Pecking order? Which personality was in charge. And this particular session? Oh, I found out all right, loud and clear. You have it on the tape. Your Honor, if we may continue? HYPNOTIST (on tape): When you drove Kathy to the river... I tried to warn her-- "Don't go with him. He's going to hurt you." HYPNOTIST: Then, who drove her? TOM (gruffly): Aw, hell, he drove her. But I had to do the work for him. Did he bring the gun, too? He always kept a gun in the car-- afraid of being robbed. Okay, so I drove her out there. I told her somebody was going to show us a car, but I... I just wanted to get alone with her, you know, try to talk some sense into her. Look, Jim and me, we just like each other, that's all. It don't mean nothing. Well, if it don't mean nothing, then you put an end to it like I say-- now. You're just jealous. Honey, that's foolish. I can't take this anymore, Daddy. I'm moving out. Honey, you're my baby girl. Don't touch me! Wait a minute, honey. No. No. No more. You know something, you embarrass me. You're always around-- around my friends, at church. You're always hanging on me. Don't say that, please. How the hell else am I going to get you to listen to me?! Sometimes I think you're deaf and dumb! Aw, please, honey... Deaf, dumb, stupid bastard! (gruffly): Don't call me that. Go to hell, you bastard. (gruffly): Bastard. You're a stupid bastard. (meekly): Daddy. DADDY: Whoo-hee! Go ahead, boy. You got the guts? You got the guts to kill your daddy? Come on. I should've killed you a long time ago. Keep away from me. Keep away! I'm warning you. No! No! No, no, no! No. (sobbing) Daddy. Go ahead, boy. Go ahead. ■■ Come on, you got the guts? You want to kill your daddy? You ain't no son of mine. You're a bastard. (shouting): Daddy! (gunshot) (gunshots) (gun chamber clicking) It was Daddy. Don't you see? It was Daddy. Our Kathy's still alive. It was Daddy. (whispering): It was Daddy. CAROL: Jim! Hey, Jim. Jim! Carol. What are you doing here? We got to talk. Look, uh... I'm sorry about what happened-- with Kathy and me... you know. Yeah. Well, right now I got other things on my mind, and if I'm going to get my kids back, I got to show that I can support them. I got to be able to feed them and clothe them. I got to keep my house, Jim. So, like it or not, I'm going to be your boss. My boss? Well, yeah, I guess from here on out, Acton Salvage means me. Now, how long is it going to take you to teach me how to work that? Hi, honey. I talked to Kathy yesterday. She's all right. She says she's sorry for all those horrible things she said. That's fine, Tom. That's just fine. I'll get it all straightened out. I'll take care of everything. I know you will. I come here today, Tom, to say good-bye to you. I'm getting the kids back for good now, and they got to know that they're going to be safe and I'm going to take care of them and that they still got a family. Well, sure they do. That's what I told Kathy. I said, "Honey, we each have our place in this family." And I told her Mama's going to need some help with the kids, getting supper on. Kathy's dead, Tom. She ain't ever coming back-- ever. Well, if she's late for supper, then there just won't be no supper. And there'll be no more talk about a car, either-- not till she proves she can be trusted. Good-bye, Tom. She listens to me. She knows that whatever I tell her, I have her... her best interests at heart. My little princess. I do believe she really does love me. I can remember when she was a little girl and I used to take her in my arms and carry her around the house. Ah... my little princess. Mommy! Mama! (laughing) CRYSTAL: Mama! Oh, God! Oh, God. (children yelling) Mama! (children laughing) (kissing) (laughing giddily) Stand back. I want to look at you. Why? You know what we look like. (laughing) (laughs): Yeah, I do. But you're never going to look exactly the way you look right now, and I want to remember this. (laughing): Mama. (whispering): I love you, babies, with all my heart.
