Please leave your message. Hey Aaron, um-- I'm just finishing up here at the storage. Just want to give you a heads up, um-- I'm gonna start heading out your way. Ehmmm-- Yeah...yeah man uh, thanks again for-- you know-- letting me-- stay with you guys. Um, hopefully I'm not-- you know intruding, or-- causing any kind of-- trouble with the lady friend or anything. Um-- but, uh-- yeah looking forward to it man, uh-- you know I haven't seen you in a while so it'll be good to-- hang out again-- maybe like old times. Yeah...that'll be good. Alright buddy well uh...um-- I'lll see you soon, alright. Oh and if you need anything just let me know, um-- I can,,,pick something up. Okay. Cool. Alright bud. Bye. Toiletries-- Laptop-- Bare essentials-- Anthing else-- Uhhh. Numbing anxiety to the point where it feels hard to breathe. So how many people are going to be there? I don't know-- A couple. A couple not a few? What's the difference? ; Oh, okay, no no no, don't play that game with me-- You know there's a difference-- Is it a "couple". Or a "few"? A few. A few, okay. So that's including us. I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? Don't lie to me. I'm not lying-- Don't start. I'm not starting anything-- How many people? Go. Ahh, I honestly don't know-- All I-- I don't. How? How can you not know? Well...because-- Okay, I don't know. All I know is-- - I don't. - Got that part. All... I just know that we're gonna over to her house, were gonna have drinks-- Okay? I don't know who else she invited-- As of right now I know that it's us-- And her boyfriend-- - And... - And the truth comes out. What? It's a fuckin' double date-- - I knew it. - I didn't say that. I knew it. I didn't say that it was a double date. Okay you didn't have to say it because I knew it. You didn't know anything. At any point in time-- did she ever use the words "double" and "date" in-- the same sentence? - the same sentence? - I don't remember. I don't remember. How convenient-- And I call bullshit. I really don't. I think you'd remember something like that. I really don't-- I don't. You're good-- - You're good at this you know. - I don't...just-- it wasn't one conversation-- it was many conversation-- You know, I feel like a jerk I've been dodging out on her invites for a while-- - Alright. - I feel like a jerk we're going. Well why are you even dodging out on her-- do you not like her?-- Because if you don't and we go to this-- - thing, it's just gonna make it even more fucking awkward-- What is she, some kind of annoying person? No I like her-- I do like her-- I think she's really cool-- I just-- I don't do well-- transitioning from-- co-worker to buddy. So you're bringing me along as a buffer? I'm bringing you along because-- her boyfriend Mike is going to be there-- and in case other people don't show up-- I don't wanna be the third wheel. Because it's a fuckin' double date. Maybe-- like what's the big deal? You wanna know what the big deal is? Mmh hmm. Double dates are awkward-- You know what kind of people double date?-- hmm? Swingers-- And last time I checked we don't swing. You're so stupid. Wha', I'm serious here-- Okay, maybe not about the swinging thing-- but definitely about the awkward thing-- Look we're gonna be sitting there on their couch-- We're gonna be-- gauging eachother-- Eye-balling eachother-- Being awkwardly polite-- Until we find some kinda common ground to riff on-- And then that conversation is going to be short lived-- because you can't base an entire conversation off of-- one, small, thing-- So that's going to lead them into -- prying into our business, asking about-- our family, or even how we met-- and I'm sure at one point in time-- you and "Vivi"-- Are gonna go-- Dude don't put her in quotations. Shush! Don't put her in quotations. Shush-- You two are gonna go off on a tangent-- talking about the "chisme" at work-- "oh did you hear what that person did--" "oh my goodness can you believe what that other person said"-- And, I'm gonna be sitting there with Mike-- trying to figure out what the fuck to talk about-- and huh-- grrh, I don't wanna-- I don't wanna-- - I don't wanna be there with these people. - Val these are...stop that-- stop that. These are real people-- like they're real people-- why do you keep using quotation marks? - They're bunny ears. - And when did I become a cliche. Okay, I'm almost done with my point-- I don't wanna be sitting there with Mike-- trying to figure out what to talk about-- because what if he likes sports, alright-- eh, I don't like sports-- I don't think people should get paid millions of dollars-- to do something they learned how to do during recess-- What if I say that?-- I'm probably gonna say that and it's gonna be fucking awkward-- I'm probably gonna say that and it's gonna be fucking awkward-- and I'm just trying to avoid-- and I'm just trying to avoid-- Okay. - having an awkward encounter. - Uh huh, okay, okay, okay-- I get it-- I understand-- But we're still gonna go-- Okay? We're still going. Gay 'ol couple time. It's gonna be good. Gay 'ol couple time, alright-- Gay 'ol couple time. - My favorite time. - It's gonna be fabulous. Gay 'ol couple time. Viv. - Hi! - Your friends are here-- hey hello. Hi. Hello. - Don't mind him he likes to talk tough. - He's good. He's- He's good. He's crazy. HI. Hi. So good to see you. Good to see you. Hi.

Wow...well if you think about it, I mean ss-- you start kinda feeling bad for her, it's like "oh man" all that build up. - I don't feel bad for her at all. - Oh man. It's gotta be rough after a while. You know what I'm saying. so it's like, man, it's almost like I understand why you-- why you hate everyone and yourself. Okay. You suck...everybody else can do it. So-- No I can't. on a more serious note I didn't want to be that guy-- but um- Oh, here we go. Uh oh. how did you meet? Oh shnap...she went there.

What the fuck did they say? They just-they're just being pervy. They're being pervy, disrespectful... - What do they say to you? - Being annoying-- To me? You know, it's not what they say to me, it's what they say to the other girls, like-- And they just fucking take it, like-- I mean which is like their own fault to some degree, but like-- I don't take their shit like-- They push me-- I push'em back-- like-- I'm not-I'm not gonna play victim. I'm not gonna succumb to that nonesense you know. Good. Yeah. Do you ever like-- say something to a manager about it? They don't, the managers don't care.

Ok-if you're so concerned with money then-- sue that place for sexual harassment-- and there you go-- money problems solved uh-hmm-- because it's easy to sue-- and it takes no time-- what-so-ever-- to do that-- - and... - Look, I get it's not practical-- that wasn't the point-- the point is-- it's not worth the fucking money for you to be-- putting yourself-- in that kind of environment day in day out-- you know it's like-- it makes me feel really uncomfortable knowing that you feel uncomfortable being there and-- at that point, like-- - why? - I mean like-- I-it's annoying, like it's annoying to see-- - as a female, as a latino like yeah. - Right-- - yeah, look... - but like-- I know, look I get you-- I mean-- I get where you're coming from-eh-ah-trust me-- like-you're not,like- You are hav-you're hearing it-- on your perspective, like you're listening to my story and like-- making it your thing.

No, I'm not gonna kick you out of your own room. Y-you-you can stay here don't just-- t-don't try anything funny. Pshhh. Mickey please-- what are you trying to say? Good-nite. Good-nite. We never held hands. What? We're gonna sleep in the same bed and-- we've just never-- held hands-- I just think it's kinda funny. We're not gonna do it. Oh-what? We're not gonna do it-- I-- So don't-- Na-I heard you, I-- I didn't say-I know we're not gonna do it I'm just saying that there's like an order of doing things and-- you know, we're just skipping steps is all. Okay...okay. We can kill two birds with one stone-- alright. O-kay. You know we've also have never made out. Dude...you have to kill it-- you have to kill it...every-time don't you-- - you kill it. - It was a joke. - No. - I was kidding. Good-nite man. - Can I have your hand back? - No-o. - Please. - No. Why not? Because I'm afraid of what you'll do to it. That's terrible-- Why would you say such a terrible thing? Mickey-- - baby? - Hmm? It's late. Let's go to bed. Hmm? Come on let's go to bed-- come on-- come on...come on...come on come on-- come on...there you go-- there you go-- there you go...let's get you to bed. Hey, can I ask you something without you taking it the wrong way?-- I mean in-- all seriousness, can we like enter this cone of trust type deal where we-- can just discuss this topic without bumming eachother out? Whoa... It's nothing bad. Ya sure? You know what, nevermind, just forget it. Just ask. Well I don't wanna ask if we can't talk about it properly. Well then-- ask, and we can find out if that's a possibility. O-K-- In the last five years do you feel like much's changed other than our living situation? A lot-- has changed. Specifically what? I don't know...like-- our living situation is a really big one-- like it changed a lot of other things in our lives-- I don't feel suffocated by-- our environment anymore, I-- don't hate my jobs as much as I hated my old job-- We're not obligated to family drama-- anymore, so that's-- those are all big things that have changed-- You don't agree? I mean-- yes, no, like-- for as positive as those things sound-- I just don't really-- feel like I'm seeing any kind of real progression-- And honestly how positive is-- "oh I don't hate my current jobs as much as my last job" shouldn't it be-- I don't hate my job at all?-- I just remember us having all these goals and stuff-- before coming out here, and then all of a sudden somewhere between-- now and then it's like we just said "Fuck it" and stopped trying to achieve them. I didn't, stop trying. Really? I mean, wha' have you been doing? Wow. Look, don't take that the wrong way alright, I'm not trying to attack you. Why do you do that? Do what? That was a--fuckin' dick thing to say. Well I didn't mean it that way alright-- look I'm sorry if I have trouble wording things properly sometimes-- Yeah-- you do, you do maybe you should-- so don't take offense to it. fuckin' think before you speak. Oh my god, okay, let's just-- put the breaks there for a second 'cause uh-- we're getting off the track really fast and I do not want to fight with you-- so--can we-- No, I don't want to fight with you. Okay, good...Perfect-- well then can...you-- just hear me out when I... when I say-- like what have you-- done, it's more like-like what have we done as individuals you know to try ah-- get to where we wanna be, I mean why aren't we where we wanna be-- to begin with. I don't know how to answer that dude, like-- I feel like we've had this conversation before. No we haven't. We haven't had this specific conversation. Well I mean we've had conversations like it-- whenever you...start-- feeling like "I'm not living up to my potential" like you start going into existential crisis mode-- you start coming at me-- you start asking me why I'm not working on the things that I should be working on-- or why I'm not helping you work on the things that you should be working on-- and it just goes on and on like- I'm not trying to blame you for my actions or lack there of-- Oh really-- okay--I acknowledge that yes I'm not fu-I'm not living up to my own potential-- and that's my own fault-- I'm not putting that on you, I just want to know that we still-- have these goals and we're still working towards them, that's-- - the bottom line. - But like-- how can I tell you-- if you still have your goals, how can I do that? Oh-okay. uh-uh fine, well I mean do you still have your goals? Yes. Good-- cool-- I mean wha'-- If you don't mind me asking like what-a-you what-a-you still trying to do? I'm-- I want to do my photography. Really?-- But you like haven't done your photography in like forever. Yeah I'm aware of that-- and I still wanna persue it-- as funny as that is. Um-I'm sorry again-- As hilarious as that might sound-- Okay look no, it's, you-- - you know? - look, look, look-fuck-- That's cool I-my bad-- Why, don't you, instead of like-- you know, try'na do-- you know two jobs, wha-- Okay-- why don't you focus more on photography then. Why don't you do that. no, no, no, why don't, why don't you-- not tell me how'd ah-- do things, why don't you...stop telling me how to-- oh I could do it this way or I should do it that way or... maybe like-- why do you do that?-- Like I don't need you to do that for me-- I know what I want to do for myself-- I want to do photography-- I wanna do it!-- I have my camera-- I have my laptop-- I have my certificate in cosmotology I don't have to depend on other people-- to supply me with looks that I want for my shoot-- I got my bachelor's degree-- in business management-- I can work out-- a business plan-- for myself-- so I can be properly self-employed-- Like I've thought it through. I've lined things up-- Right, I've heard that before-- I've made an effort-- - I have made an effort. - I've-I've heard that before and-- you know I'm-forgive me for caring-- like everything you just said-- just shows that you have every- thing at your disposal to-- be doing what it is that you wanna do-- but you're not doing it and that's my whole thing-- it's like when is it gonna happen? It-- When it happens-- It's my thing. Okay, but that does- that's not-- getting us anywhere you me anybody like-- "when it happens," what the fuck does that mean? Okay-- so like-- are you concerned-- with what I am not doing?-- Or are you concerned with what you are not doing? Both. Eh, am I not... I don-i don't know what to tell you...we're-- I don't know what to say-- what can I say, what can I tell you?-- Like wer-we're gonna have to figure it out-- Like that's it, that's all there is to it. Good, alright, well let's figure it out. Okay-- Well we're gonna have to do it some other night-- because I have to go to sleep! -- No, no, come on-- I have to go to sleep! don't do that, don't run away from this-- don't run away from this, look-- - I am not running away! - I don't wanna end the night like this-- you are being a dick about it!-- I am not running away. Oh my god, oh my god why can't we just have discussions without them turning into this kind of shit. Well maybe it's the way that you fuckin' approach shit you know-- Maybe you shouldn't come into things asking me-- "Um, can we enter a cone of trust-- where we don't bum eachother out?"-- like you decided-- you were bummed out already before it even started-- And then you go around and you ask me-- "what's changed in the last five years?"-- Like why don't you just start the conversation by saying-- "I want things to change"-- Don't worry about what I'm doing worry about what you're doing. Work on youself, I will work on myself-- support me-- I will support you-- Like what the fuck! Look I am gonna work on me, and I hear ya loud and clear-- and I am trying to support you, but I just feel like right now all I'm doing is-- supporting your procrastination and it's not really get-- I'm sorry look-- our procrastination, I meant our procrastination-- I heard you, like-- just...just good-nite, good-nite. That's probably best, good-nite. And where are you going? I'm gonna go to the office, and I'm gonna try to do something productive. Is that alright? So-- presents? Yes-- but I wanna go first, give me, give me, give me, give me-- - give me... - Okay, okay, okay. ] I thought you disappeared. Okay...so-- there was something I originally wanted to buy you but I figured that you already had it, so thought I'd-- try to be a little more original and just make something. I'm excited. And thus I drew your pretty face. Awe. I've never been drawn before. It's really cool. I'm gonna frame it-- or it's framed already but-- Ah yeah, I was gonna-- I meant I was gonna hang it up-- just so everybody can see it, and that way when you're famous-- - they'll be jealous. - Oh nonesense. Oh shut up. - Oh no, my turn. - Whoa, huh? - My turn. - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah that's right. - Hold that. - Okay. Oh-- Keys. Oh. - Tada! - Oh shit! Woah. Do you like it?

We'll just, have it later, it's fine. - Sure? - Yeah. Cool, okay. Come hither. Come and have a seat-ah. Oh, haw-haw-haw-- Yeah that's right-- We have a fire going. I figured that you know it's been awhile since we had a date night and everything-- and uh, oh wait actually hold on, hold on let me-- let me get that-- You wanna turn down the fire? No, no no, no let me-- let me-let me get this for you-- So...please hav-have a seat. Yu-got-epp-epp-- epp-- There ya go-- there ya go, kinda-- gentleman about it. Mmmm-- - Well that's nice. - Cool. I thought I'd ah-- you know set something up-- to the point where you can have-- a date-- and-- be in your p.j.'s at the same time. Yeah, uh-- So-- I don't think I'm a bother with that right now. Alright then...well I mean... - Oh uh would you like a beer? - I'm sorry, where are my manners. Sure. Good answer. Now-- I don't think you've had this guy before-- So I'd hope you like it-- I like it-- Oh-- Oh-- Look at you-- Ah-- So thoughtful-- Catching yourself. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Mmmh. - Yeah? Uh-huh. - Yeay? - Yeay. Yee-ay. Yee-aay. Um-- So...uh shall we? - Uh-mm, yeah. - Ladies first. You get...you get the pickin's. Except for that one. Joking, yeah you can have that one. - I'm gonna grab this one. - Okay good. I will grab this one. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Pizza cheers. - Pizza cheers. oh. - Oh, eh-for our homies. - Nice piece of garlic. Hmm. - Mmm-huh. - It's good. Oh yeah I made sure there was plenty of garlic on that. Good job. Mm-huh. It's really good. So we're definitely gonna make-out later. - Oh yeah-- Mm-huh. - Hard. - ah-huh. - Uh-hmm. I went on a...jog earlier today. And um-- I was doing a lot of thinking and-- I had totally forgot about that one time when we ah-- planned that "unbirthday" for eachother-- - Mm-hmm. - Remember, and I drew that picture for you? Uh-huh. Yeah, that was a nice night wasn't it? I mean I love the picture. But-- that wasn't the greatest night. No? Nuh-uh. Why? What happened? I killed it. - You did? - Pretty. much. Mm-huh. Yeah. Remember I got drunk, I acted like a jerk. I love moments like these. Hmmm? Like when you're just hanging out with someone and-- you just-- bullshit and talk about random stuff and-- all of a sudden there's a-- quiet-- moment-- but not like an awkward quiet, it's just-- more like-- still an'-- peaceful an'-- I try to store those moments in my mind like a picture-- so i can draw'em later. And I think it's those pauses-- they're like the defining parts of those moments too you know. Not really. Let me put it this way-- it's like if I were gonna-- draw-- a comic strip-- of this moment-- like on the first page I would dedicate-- at least three to four panels of-- just how I view the moment before actually like implementing any kind of-- characters in action poses. There aren't a lot of comics that do that kind of stuff. I think everyone's just afraid of-- embracing the stillness-- just slowing things down-- I wanna have a lot of-- those still moments-- in my comic. Don't you think people might find that kinda boring though? Uh-- sure I mean-- Maybe...but-- I don't think that really matters 'cause-- those kind of people-- who'd find it boring aren't gonna be the type of people that are going to be into my comic book so-- fuck'em...I don't think it really matters. Why is your comic gonna be like some sort of hipster exclusive or something? Uhh-um-- sure. Oh fuck-- I'm sorry-- that came off mean-- Sorry. Hey it's cool-- don't worry about it. It's fuckin' not-- cool-- It's not cool-- fuck. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fuckin' fine can we just call it a night?-- I'm...just-- over it. Are you alright to drive? Yeah I'm not fuckin' stupid so I think I can fuckin' drive. Yo I didn't-- I mean, mean anything by it-- I was just-- checkin' wit' you. Yeah-- can you jus' get in the fuckin' car-- so we can-- I just wanna get out of here now. You know what I'll just walk. Why do you fucking wanna walk everywhere? Just get in the fucking car! I just think you should just go straight home-- rather than have to drop me off first is all. Jus' get in the fucking car-- so I can take you home, let's go. Fine whatever. I was drunk, I acted like a jerk-- like can we change the subject?-- we don't-- I thought we were supposed to be having a good time like-- We are you know I'm sorry...no, um-- let's-- you're right-- Ah-- I-- Why are we talking about that? I-I just-- I don't know, I just ah I-I-- I didn't remember exactly wha' happened and I guess I was you know I'm sorry-- you're right, you're right- pizza, pizza time-- What time is it? - Pizza time. - Right-- Perfect. Pizza time. Good. You know, don't get me wrong like you are a really-- you're a great guy-- You're my favorite person in the world but lately it's been-- difficult-- being around you-- like working two jobs is hard-- Mickey you don't have to work two jobs-- But I kinda feel like I do-- - though. - Then why do you feel that way is what llike-- what I contribute not enough? It's n-- It's not that it's not enough I just-- I mean you're freelance you know like it makes me nervous-- having a question mark on your next gig. Wait so like-- hold on I mean like-- So ev-even if-if I was doing what I wanted to do then-- it would still be the same issue because-- ye-- all artists have like a high probability of-- of inconsistent income so-- wa-- oh my god-- you know what Mickey?-- Ah-I think you're biggest issue is me-- I'm your biggest problem. Huh, that's not what I'm saying it just-- it would be different-- if you were doing what you really wanted-- How would that be different, it's the same thing. It wouldn't because you'd be in a different head space and... like-- that changes everything-- Like I'm really sensitive to the energy you put out. But ah-- you know isn't that kinda of ah-- double standard...I mean-- like ah, the other night, though-- ya know ya-ya come home from work venting about it in a not so positive fashion an-- then you snap at me because it was stressing me out. Yeah but that had nothing to do with me ah-- I walked in you were already in a bad place you were in ya head you were being negative. Alright-but I mean tha-that's besides the point, you know, it's not like you yourself were-- talking about the-- tales of-- of happiness-- and joy that you get from the two jobs that you adore with all your heart-- Mickey? Is-is that why you're not doing your photography, like ye-- you're just-- you're scared of-- of inconsistency? Hey I know you don't want to hear from me right now-- but you forgot some stuff-- just got home and I'm a bit tired-- but you can get it whenever. Cool. Thanks. Yo? Yeah. Cool man. Okay. Yeah, i-I'm just a few blocks down. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sweet. Alright buddy, well I'll see ya in a bit okay? Cool thanks man. Later.
