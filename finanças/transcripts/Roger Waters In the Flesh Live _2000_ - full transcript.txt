Brezhnev took Afghanistan And Begin took Beirut Galtieri took the Union Jack And Maggie over lunch one day Took a cruiser with all hands Apparently to make him give it back Maggie, what have you done They disembarked in '45 And no one spoke And no one smiled There were too many spaces in the line And gathered at the cenotaph They all agreed with hand on heart To sheath the sacrificial knives But now She stands upon Southampton Dock With her handkerchief and her summer frock Clings to her wet body in the rain In quiet desperation Knuckles white upon the slippery reins She bravely waves the boys good-bye again Maggie what have you done And still the dark stain spreads between Their shoulder blades A mute reminder Of the poppy fields and graves When the fight was over We spent what they had made But In the bottom of our hearts We felt the final cut If you didn't care What happened to me And I didn't care For you We would zig zag our way Through the boredom and pain Occasionally glancing up through the rain Wondering which of the buggers to blame And watching For pigs on the wing You gotta be crazy You gotta have a real need You gotta sleep on your toes When you're on the street You got to be able to pick out the easy meat With your eyes closed Then moving in silently Downwind and out of sight You gotta strike when the moment is right Without thinking And after a while You can work on points for style Like the club tie And the firm handshake A certain look in the eye and an easy smile You have to be trusted By the people that you lie to So that when they turn their backs on you You'll get the chance To put the knife in You gotta keep one eye Looking over your shoulder You know, it's gonna get harder Harder and harder As you get older Yeah, in the end you'll pack up Fly down south Hide your head in the sand Just another sad old man All alone and dying of cancer And when you lose control You'll reap the harvest you have sown And as the fear grows The bad blood slows and turns To stone And it's too late to lose the weight You used to need to throw around So have a good drown As you go down All alone Dragged down by the stone Gotta admit That I'm a little bit confused Sometimes it seems to me As if I'm just being used Gotta stay awake Gotta try and shake off This creeping malaise If I don't stand my own ground How can I find my way out of this maze Deaf, dumb and blind You just keep on pretending That everyone's expendable And no one has a real friend And it seems to you the thing to do Would be to isolate the winner And everything's done under the sun And you believe at heart everyone's a killer Who was born in a house full of pain Who was trained not to spit in the fan Who was told what to do by the man Who was broken by trained personnel Who was fitted with collar and chain Who was given a pat on the back Who was breaking away from the pack Breaking away from the pack Who was only a stranger at home Only a stranger at home Who was ground down in the end Ground down in the end Who was found dead on the phone Found dead on the phone Who was dragged down by the stone Who was dragged down By the stone Welcome, my son Welcome to the machine Where have you been It's all right We know where you've been You've been in the pipeline Filling in time Provided with toys and scouting for boys You bought a guitar to punish your ma And you didn't like school And you know you're nobody's fool So welcome Welcome To the machine Welcome To the machine Welcome, my son Welcome to the machine What did you dream It's all right We told you what to dream You dreamed of a big star He played a mean guitar But he always ate at the Steak Bar And he loved to drive in his Jaguar So welcome Welcome To the machine So, so you think you can tell Heaven from hell Blue skies from pain Can you tell a green field From a cold steel rail A smile from a veil Do you think you can tell And did they get you to trade Your heroes for ghosts Hot ashes for trees And hot air for a cool breeze Cold comfort for change And did you exchange A walk-on part in the war For a lead role in a cage How I wish How I wish you were here We're just two lost souls Swimming in a fish bowl Year after year Running over the same old ground What have we found The same old fears I wish that you were here Oh, how I wish you were here How I wish How I wish you were here Running over the same old ground What have we found The same old fears And I wish that you were here Remember when you were young You shone like the sun Shine on You crazy diamond Now there's a look in your eyes Like black holes in the sky Shine on You crazy diamond You were caught in the cross fire Of childhood and stardom Blown on the steel breeze Come on you target For faraway laughter Come on, you stranger you legend, you martyr and shine You reached for the secret too soon You cried for the moon Shine on You crazy diamond Threatened by shadows at night And exposed in the light Shine on - You crazy diamond - You crazy diamond Well, you wore out your welcome With random precision Rode on the steel breeze Come on, you raver You seer of visions Come on, you painter You piper, you prisoner and shine Nobody knows where you are How near or how far Shine on You crazy diamond Pile on many more layers And I'll be joining you there Shine on - You crazy diamond - You crazy diamond And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph Sail on the steel breeze Come on, you boychild You winner and loser Come on, you miner for truth and delusion And shine Shine Shine Shine Shine Ooh, shine Shine Shine Shine Ooh, shine Shine Shine Ooh, shine Shine Shine Oh, shine Shine Shine Little by little the night turns around Counting the leaves which tremble at dawn Lotuses lean on each other in yearning Under the eaves the swallow is resting Set the controls for the heart of the sun Over the mountain watching the watcher Breaking the darkness Waking the grapevine One inch of love is one inch of shadow Love is the shadow that ripens the wine Set the controls for the heart of the sun The heart of the sun The heart of the sun The heart of the sun The heart of the sun The heart of the sun The heart of the sun The heart of the sun The heart of the sun Witness the man who raves at the wall Making the shape of his question to heaven Whether the sun will fall in the evening Will he remember the lesson of giving Set the controls for the heart of the sun The heart of the sun The heart of the sun The heart of the sun The heart of the sun The heart of the sun The heart of the sun The heart of the sun The heart of the sun The heart of the sun The heart of the sun Breathe Breathe in the air Don't be afraid to care Leave, but don't leave me Look around Choose your own ground For long you live and high you fly Smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry All you touch and all you see Is all your life will ever be Run, rabbit, run Dig that hole Forget the sun And when at last the work is done Don't sit down It's time to dig another one For long you live and high you fly But only if you ride the tide Balanced on the biggest wave You race towards an early grave Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown Waiting for someone or something to show you the way Tired of lying in the sunshine Staying home to watch the rain You are young and life is long And there is time to kill today And then one day you find Ten years have got behind you No one told you when to run You missed the starting gun And you run, you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking And racing around to come up behind you again And the sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older Shorter of breath and one day closer to death Every year is getting shorter Never seem to find the time Plans that either come to naught Or half a page of scribbled lines Hanging on in quiet desperation Is the English way The time is gone The song is over Thought I'd something more to say Home, home again I like to be here when I can And when I come home cold and tired It's good to warm my bones beside the fire Faraway across the field The tolling of the iron bell Calls the faithful to their knees To hear the softly spoken magic spell Money Get away Get a good job with more pay and you're okay Money It's a gas Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash New car, caviar four-star daydream Think I'll buy me a football team Money Get back But I'm all right, Jack Keep your hands off of my stack Money It's a hit But don't give me that do goody good bullshit I'm in the high fidelity first-class travelling set I think I need a Learjet Money It's a crime Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie Money So they say Is the root of all evil today But if you ask for a raise It's no surprise that they're giving none away Away Away Away Away Away In truck stops And hamburger joints In Cadillac limousines In the company of has-beens And bent-backs And sleeping forms on pavement steps And in libraries And railway stations In books and banks In the pages of history In suicidal cavalry attacks I recognize Myself In every stranger's eyes And in wheelchairs by monuments Under tube trains and commuter accidents In council care and county courts At Easter fairs and seaside resorts And in drawing rooms and city morgues In award-winning photographs Of life rafts on the China seas In transit camps Under arc lamps And on loading ramps And faces blurred by rubber stamps I recognize Myself In every stranger's eyes And now From where I stand Upon this hill I plundered from the pool I look around I search the skies I shade my eyes So nearly blind And I see signs Of half-remembered days I hear bells that chime In strange, familiar ways I recognize The hope you kindle In your eyes And so So easy now As we lie here In the dark Nothing interferes It's obvious How to beat the tears That threaten to snuff out The spark Of our love Stop, Dave. Will you stop, Dave? Stop, Dave. I'm afraid. I'm afraid, Dave. Dave... my mind is going. I can feel it. I can feel it. My mind is going. There is no question about it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I'm afraid.
