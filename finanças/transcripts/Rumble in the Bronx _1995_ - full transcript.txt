She has all kinds of jobs. Well, that just means she loves you. Just be good to her. Sometimes when I go to the park and I see other kids playing with their sisters and I can't, I really get mad at myself. That's not your fault. You can't blame yourself. You're a pretty smart kid, looking after yourself. I wish my legs were like other kids' so I could take care of her myself. And I wouldn't have to worry about her. Because I really love her. Nancy, you're home. Why are you crying? What's wrong? Oh, this is my best friend, Keung. And my sister, Nancy. Isn't she pretty? Oh, well, not right now. I'm sorry. Shh! Never mind. Forget the past.

But you weren't, as you should have been. Because you were out on a date with the neighborhood gang-leader's girlfriend. And that's the problem. They were looking for you, so they came here for revenge. I shouldn't blame you. It's all my fault. You don't live here. You came for your uncle's wedding. I wanted your help. Perhaps I should thank you. I just don't know why I thought this would work. And why I thought I could depend on you. KEUNG: Nancy, where's Tony? I think I know where he is. [THUGS LAUGHING] MAN: Oh, man. Hey, how's it going? Hey, Nancy. Hi. Who's that? Oh, no one. Just a friend of mine. Go. New squeeze? [LAUGHS] Yeah, sure. All right.

MAN: Some guys in a limo. It was terrible. Hey, what is that, man? Oh! Who would do this? Keung, a friend of mine got murdered. They said if we don't return the stuff Angelo took, we'll all end up like Lance. Where's Angelo now? Where is he? I don't know! What do you mean you don't know? [GROANING] Where's Angelo? Where is he? I don't know. I don't know! I think I know where he is. Let's get him. No, I think we better call police. I don't deal with cops. They are not cops. They are FBI.

Thank you, Danny. You're welcome. Move! MAN: You'll be sorry. You're gonna die. What's the difference between these diamonds and my sister's? I think about $7 million or so. Whoa. Did you get through? Oh, the police put me on hold. [PHONE RINGING] Yeah? WHITE TIGER [OVER PHONE]: Are you there? What's happening? Have you got my diamonds? [IN DEEP VOICE] Yes. Make sure you get rid of the Chinaman and the kid. Leave no witnesses. [IN NORMAL VOICE] You want to kill me? Who the hell is this? I'm the Chinaman! I have your people. I have your diamonds. What do you want? I just want my friends back. Did you call the cops? Did you? No. You better not if you want your friends back alive. Keep this phone and wait for my call. I'll tell you what to do. Hello? Go to school and wait for me. Take care of him. Thank you. Take care of my sister. Okay. Be careful. DANNY: You too. Listen, tell me where the Chinese guy is. All I know is he's the owner of the Wah Ha supermarket. LISA: Hi, Keung. Hi. ELAINE: And I want you to deliver to me every week. Elaine. Hey, Keung. Look at this. Didn't we do a great job renovating? We've been working 24 hours a day. Pretty impressive, huh? Oh. There's no reason to quit now. I'm determined to make it even better than before. Yeah. It's very nice. What's wrong? Do you have someplace quiet? What do you mean, "quiet"? Look. Wow. Glass doesn't sparkle like that. Can't be. Don't tell me these diamonds are real. They're real, all right, but stolen. [GASPS] Okay, everybody, lunchtime. Go upstairs. Lisa, lock the door. All right, let's go. KEUNG: You have to help me. Why should I, huh? Those fellows can die. They did so much damage to the store, I'll take a few as payback. Please don't do that. I need them for ransom. That's serious. Well, call the police. I did. That's why we're in trouble. I don't know what to do. No one will notice if I took a few. [CELL PHONE RINGS] Hello? Mr. Keung, where are you? You don't need to know. Where's my friends? You'll find out. Just come down to the supermarket. What? Just come down. Hello? Now what? He said to go to the supermarket. Ha-ha. He must think you own the supermarket. Hey, what can he do to you? He's bluffing. Just trying to scare you. Where are you going? Bathroom. You don't need diamonds in the bathroom. Hey, come on. This is no joke. [SIGHS] Women. [♪♪♪] MAN: Hurry up. Get in the cab. Go on, move. Come on. Start it up. [ENGINE RUMBLING] Elaine, open up! Go away. Open up first. Leave me alone. [TIRES SCREECHING] [SCREAMS] Hey, Elaine, are you okay? Are you okay? Oh! I'm ruined! Now I have nothing left! I'm finished! Hey, don't do that. Hey, I can see you. Of course you can see me! So can everyone on the street! What does it matter? Hey. What is the big deal? I'll pay you back for everything. I'll kill you, you devil! It's all your fault! It's all your fault. You've ruined me. You wrecked my home. What are you trying to do to me? Are you trying to kill me? No, I'm trying to kill me. I'll show you. I'm jumping. Hey, don't jump. Don't jump. I'm jumping! Just relax. Relax. [CELL PHONE RINGING] It's the phone. The phone. Hello? Mr. Keung. Yes. So how do you like my style? [SOBBING] Hey, quiet down. No one bargains with me. Where's my friends? If I don't have those diamonds in my hands in one hour, you'll never see your friends alive again. Yes, yes. Give me the address. 100 Beach Avenue. 100 Beach... H-hello? What? [SOBBING] Quiet, please. I have to figure out how to save them. Figure out how to save me! I'll give you a big diamond, okay? You promise? No excuses. I hope I call the real cops this time. [DIALING] Maybe they're in here. What are you doing? Looking for diamonds. Hello? Hello? [POLICE SIRENS BLARING] Police? DETECTIVE: Look, Keung, we think these guys work for a syndicate run by a man named White Tiger. You gotta find a way to get to him. So I want you to just show them this one diamond. Try to get them to talk about the murder and the robbery. And try to get them to name names and places. If you don't, we don't have any hard evidence here. I only care about my friends. Don't worry. We will get your friends back. How is he? Good. Okay, testing, testing, testing. Here comes Ahab the Arab. How is it? Good. Okay. Try to say something. [SPEAKING IN CANTONESE] Okay. Good, let's go, kiddo. Keung, listen. Don't worry. They won't do anything in a restaurant. Not in a public place. HOWARD: Not really. What about the last time they threw a grenade into the crowd? You better be careful. Don't worry, we'll back you up. What the hell is wrong with you? Is that smoke affecting your brain? What are you, stupid? Good grief, don't you understand anything? Keung. Keep the change. Oh, thank you. Don't worry, we got you covered. Code 4, got the Tiger by the tail. There they are. It's good. Okay, where's the rest of our diamonds? The diamonds are part of the robbery. When they sold them, people got killed. How can you say they're yours? Smart, very smart. It's none of your business. Look, if you want to see your friends again, just give us the rest of our diamonds. I want to see my friends first. No, I can't do that. I don't think you guys can make that decision. I want to see your boss, White Tiger. Stupid! Don't mention White Tiger. Our boss is not White Tiger. KEUNG: If your boss is not White Tiger I think I'm talking to the wrong people. Stay here. Just hold on. Hey, boss, you've got a call. Boss, this is Jordan. I think they're onto us. He called you White Tiger. He shouldn't know my name. He does know it. Maybe he went to the cops. Well, search him to see if he's wired, you idiot. Okay. My boss would like to see you. That's it. He's got it. Come with me. Birds are flying. Let's go. Check. [♪♪♪] Your boss stays in the boat house? Hey, which one is it? He stays here? In number... [GRUNTS] What number? What number? [MUFFLED SCREAM] Hm. [STATIC CRACKLING] Ah! [GROANS] Yes? Boss, he was wired. He's working with the police. Kill him, kill the hostages. We don't want any evidence. JORDAN: We didn't find the diamonds. To hell with the diamonds. We don't want any more trouble. Don't worry about it. We'll take care of it. So, what'd the boss say? Kill him. Kill the hostages. Leave the diamonds and move on. Hey, I know where the diamonds are. You... You guy want the diamonds, don't you? It's too late. Come on! There he goes! [♪♪♪] Come on! Move! Go on. Hey, Jordan. He's here. He's not going anywhere. He's stuck. Hey! COP: All clear! Hey, go after them. You okay? Yeah. What do we do now? Boss says kill the hostages. Quick! They're gonna kill my friends. Ah, they won't kill your friend. Help's on the way. What? On the way? [POLICE SIRENS BLARING] Come on, quick. Get out of here. Let's move! Shit! It's too late. Come on. Howard, are you okay? HOWARD: I don't know. COP: Where the hell do you think you're going?

Yes, thank you. You guys want a ride? Sure. Let's go. Unit 3, what's the official reason for this ride? Because White Tiger's hoods have control of the thing. [LAUGHING] Unit 3, copy.
