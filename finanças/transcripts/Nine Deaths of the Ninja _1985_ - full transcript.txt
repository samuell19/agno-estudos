Time to do a little dancing. Gentlemen, you had just observed the combat exercise conducted by one of the world's best anti-terrorist teams. From Japan, the captain of the DART Team, Spike Shinobi. Hello. How you doing? His US counterpart, Captain Steve Gordon. Good work there. Yeah. Right, right. In charge of communications and control, Lieutenant Jennifer Barnes. DART flight 78 Zulu here. We are planned for immediate departure, range condition yellow, routine dust, but I'm able to clear the zone. Contact Jackrabbit Four S.O. 2667... * Don't know how or why * This whole thing started * Is it worth a try * From one outsmarted? * I've been here before, but the feeling's new * * With the same smiles I wore * * And second hand lies too * Don't know when or where * I missed my chances * Maybe it's unfair * To skip your fine dances * But I've danced before and the song had to end * * You bring music once more * Can this be our song, my friend? * * So take me high * Lead me to every twist and turn * * So take me high * I won't stop until each step I learn * * So take me high * I'll close my eyes * While you're gone * And keep on dancing * Even if the music's gone * Don't know which or who of us * * Must be blamed * Maybe too late, too soon * The simple me came * I've been here before, but the feeling's new * * And I'm dancing once more * The scale is cast too, my friend * * So take me high * Lead me to every twist and turn * * So take me high * I won't stop until each step I learn * * So take me high * I'll close my eyes * While you're gone * And keep on dancing * Keep on dancing * Keep on dancing * Even if the music stops * So take me high * Keep on dancing * Take me high * Keep on moving * Take me high * Take me high * Keep on trying * Take me high * Keep on dancing * Yeah, take me high * You gotta keep on moving * Take me high * Keep on, keep on, yeah * And keep on dancing * Keep on dancing * Keep on dancing * Even if the music stops * Welcome, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. Welcome. Thank you. And you must be Congressman Morrison. That's right. We're honored to have you with us, sir. Thank you. And this must be Mr. Perkins. Yes, my dear. It's nice to meet you. Delighted to meet you. Mrs. Garcia? Hello. Hi. And who do we have here? This is Amanda. Hi, Amanda. Hi. It's nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. You're in for a big treat today. You'll see. That's Shane and Kane, the sons of Dr. Yamada. Why don't you go and play with them? Nancy, nice to meet you. Go on, go on. Yuck. All righty, Ms. Woodman. Thanks, Ed. Everyone, you may board the bus. We're about to begin the tour. * * This morning's tour will take us to one of the most active volcanoes in the world today. We will view Volcano Island which is in the middle of Lake Taal. It was once the home of 140 families. * They have an escort. Move your men in position. Now, a major fault zone runs across this area. And most of the peaks you see are volcanic in origin. Archeological studies have traced human habitation to some 250,000 years ago. The first settlers from Borneo landed on the western shores of Batangas. They were a Proto-Malay people, slight of build with light brown skin. The fertile volcanic soil and abundant rainfall have combined to produce a rich and very plantlike. * * Our Lady of Pillars was erected in 1812 by Father Sabrino. I am Colonel Honey Hump. And you, my dear, are my prisoners. You will remain calm and quiet until the time comes for your release. The first one of you suckers that gives me a problem gets turned over to him. And this is Dr. Wolf. He likes to cut people open to see what they had for breakfast. Move it. Move it. Mr. Rankin's office. Yes, sir? Just one moment. It's Major Quirino of the constabulary's office. What? A highjack? We're in deep trouble. Alert my men and have them ready to roll in five minutes. I'll inform the ambassador. * Yes, sir. Sorry to bother you. I have a priority one. Uh-hmm. Commander, I just spoke with the president about the Philippine situation. He gave his approval to send in the DART Team. We will exercise red option four under NSD directive 138 immediately, got it? * A band of warriors from the Iga Clan is now approaching from the south. You have been chosen to meet the challenge. * * Kill me, please. Let me die quickly. A ninja does not allow himself to be swayed by emotion. You are not worthy. You must follow a different path to true insight. Go. The fruits of a vigorous meditation. Yeah, I had a sharp vision. And what did you see? Watermelon. Ah. DART 10 Alpha, this is JSOA operations. You have a red option four active. I repeat, you have a red option four active. Here they are fresh from the lab. See that these get distributed to all barrio captains and police units. Yeah, I'd say the timing of our bus security man's disappearance is the most peculiar, don't you think? Most peculiar. It hurts. Not nice. Is everything in place? Yes! Except for the costar. Come on. What are you guys doing to me? Hurry up or you'll be late for that. We're going to make a star out of you, put you on TV. It's working? Yeah, go. I, as a commander of the forces that took control of the embassy bus, as you can see, the passengers are unharmed at least as of this moment. This, your cooperation, there will be no more bloodshed. It's unnecessary. Our demands are quite simple. First, I will require the release of Mohammad Rahji from the government prison. Instructions on his release will be forthcoming. Second, all American drug enforcement personnel who have been harassing my operation and jailing my people, they'll be withdrawn from the Southeast Asia. A list of these personnel will also be forthcoming. If you fail to comply with these demands, all hostages will be executed. To demonstrate my serious intentions, I offer you this example of my commitment. * Don't fight it. Consider yourself lucky. You're prettier than the other woman. Now, I'll see to it that you live longer than they will. You should be sweet to me, baby. I got the power of life in just over you. Nothing's going to stop me from getting what I want. So, Dr. Wolf found you too hot to handle. Mineral pigs, you should learn to let a woman satisfy you. That's the only way to fight his kind, huh? Yeah, sure. Put all the choppers you've got on this search. I don't give a crap what your problem is. We have a US congressman in their party. Damn. * To demonstrate my serious intentions, I offer you this example of my commitment. Oh. So you can see what we're dealing with. This is the boss that they want to release by noon, Monday or they'll shoot the hostages. Mohammad Rahji also known as Rahji the butcher. Yeah. He and his men tried to blow up the embassy. A suicide mission just like Beirut, but we stopped them in time and took Rahji prisoner. Hmm, the butcher was once the leader of the South Yemen terrorist group. That was before he got into the drug trade. He was also in on that massacre at LOAD airport. They say Alby loves him. Albert Brent, German national, known by Interpol as Alby the Cruel. He was involved in that Munich massacre. He once got careless and let a firebomb go off in his lap. He's known to the Southeast Asian drug trade in a big way. I've been keeping an eye on them for the Drug Enforcement Agency. And this is the pisser. It's the DEA personnel in the Far East. Yeah. Look who's name is at the top. Yours. Well, we better find Branham and ask him a few personal questions. Is this Branham an art connoisseur? Not that I know of, why? Well, according to his phone log, he calls the Museum of Asian Culture frequently. Let's take a look. * * That was his last jump. Okay, all clear. Hump, get them off the bus. All right, line them up. All right, hurry up. Move your butt. Come on, hurry up. Keep going, yeah. Move it. Move it. Keep going. Oh, little girl. Oh, my. Mama, mama, I'm not feeling so good. You take one of your pills now. You know what happens when you don't get a chance to take them. Hey. What do we got here? Yellow jackets. Give me those. That's my daughter's medication. Boy, we got some heavy stuff here. Oh, please give it to me. It's for daughter's heart condition. Tough shit, bitch. Bravo. How entertaining. I've never seen such a pitiful group of hostages before, most amusing. What? Who's it? You little faggot, I'll kill you, you son of a bitch. Mom. Mama, I'm really sorry, mom. Oh, it's okay, honey. It's okay. I'm so sorry. I don't know about you two but this jetlag has finally caught up with me. I think I'm going to take a hot bath and go to bed. I'm going to buy some lollipops. What are you going to do? Having lunch with Ms. Lee. Got to keep moving, you know. Yeah, I know. Well, hello. Ms. Lee is so beautiful. If you like airheads, maybe. Look, by the way, the coroner reported needle scabs on Branham's legs. Evidently, Alby kept him supplied and it's been exchanged for inside information. And the people at the museum? Alby's drug runners. Look, I'll see you later. Well, Alby ain't going to like hearing this. Did you get their pictures? Don't you dare touch one hair of sweet little Bobby. You understand me, Hump? Sure, Alby, is he that good to you? You better address me as Mr. Brant. Don't mess with me, chump. You shoot me and my girls will snuff your monkey ass. No need for all this hostility. We must stick together. Yeah. So keep your squeeze off of my tit. What tit? Listen, I talked to Fu and he said Braham has been nailed because Rankin sent in some experts from the States. Neutralize them. Coordinate with the informer. We must render retribution. Find me a volunteer. Yeah. So you're the geezer. Huh? Here's your geezer. He'll make a nice corpse, won't he? Sure. This geezer is fine. Yeah. You're going on a little hike. It's only a matter of time before the authorities located this camp. By then, we will be safely in the mountains. * To a long and exciting friendship. Like the friendship you have with Ms. Barnes? Yes, but even better. That remains to be seen. Uh-hmm. A lot remains to be seen. Oh, I see, your boss comes here too. Yes, he has lunch here quite often. Excuse me. * I see you like Asian girl. You nasty American, I no like you dark meat. Dark meat, yeah, good. You bitch ass. Hey, let's get out of here. Very impressive. See you at the office. Cute, huh? How did you know they'd hit us? I saw these guys at the hotel. Nice disguise, huh? How did you find us? Well, I got a um, tracking beacon taped to my leg. And using my radio, I can home right in. Driver, you can take him to the American Embassy and then you can take us to, uh... My place. * * Cream and sugar the way you like it. I see you're still playing with your balls. Here, you want to play with them? Gentlemen, I have some new information for you to consider. While most of you were sleeping, Spike was interrogating the prisoner. And he's obtained some delightful news I must say. Alby has issued an execution order. He wants the DART Team eliminated. This guy doesn't waste any time. Rankin. Jeez. Not a damn thing. We'll have to release Rahji. Okay. Stay on his ass. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. * * Now, move. He abandoned his car inside Intramuros. I see him. He's heading for Chinatown. * * I want a clean girl. No crap. Are you kidding? My girls are sterilized, sanitized and lobotomized. But first, you want to show me a little money? Fifty bucks will buy you a short time. * Oh, you want Trixie, huh? Well, that's a good choice. She has very clean thighs. You'll be in room four. It's our cleanest room. She'll join you in a minute. * I lost them in three dragon alley. Yeah, I figured you did because I got them in sight. * Lollipop, this is control. Let me know when you're airborne. Yeah, on my way. You sure are. I see boss first, then he slit your throat. * Air prompt, this is the voice of Mohammad Rahji. I am now free. Praise Allah. Excellent, Rahji. I-- for you, I have arranged rest and rehabilitation aboard Madame Woo Pee's floating boat palace. I am look forward to be seeing you again. Enough rest. Get this shwein on her feet. The quicker we get rid of them, the better. Wow. * Macho Man, this is control. I have confirmation on a SATCOM red. The quail is inbound your position, do you copy? Roger that. Switching to delta one. Lollipop, this is the Macho Man, do you read? Roger. Sorry for delay, I had a little problem. Standby for pick up. All right. Listen up. He's got something to say. From this base camp, we will go on defense. Mohammad's release was a great victory, but an even greatest one of it, when we attack and destroy the forces that are searching for us. When that is done, successfully completed, then you will have your reward, but you must earn it. Foxy, this is Lollipop, we're on our way to Madame Woo Pee's floating palace. * Hi! Hi! Nice welcoming committee, wouldn't you say? * Listen, you swim out to the barge and I'll keep an eye on the girls. * Where did they go? Ladies, let's have a chat. * Well, they're taking their damn sweet time. My sister Woo Wee warned me about these creeps. This Rahji's a deviant. A seven-foot pervert. Don't worry. The girls take care of themselves. I mean love, it's the rarest of all things defined and it can't be purchased. Sometimes, I just get choked up when I think about it. I just wish I wasn't so filthy rich. We could clean out your pipes. You answer my question or you will join your ancestors, do you understand? This nazi keeps sending me these goons to entertain. If he didn't pay so well, I'd blow his scrawny ass back to Berlin. The camp is here, I don't lie. Good. Then, no bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm busy. I have-- I have-- Hi there, handsome. Looking for something? I uh, was looking for the madam. Oh, so you want to make Woo Pee? Get the bastard. * Suppose to keep your mind on business. This is business. You always were a sucker for violent types. Let's go. We got a probable LZ in the two zero niner, radio of the Jamalic VOR, forty-five nautical, BME, outbound. Our plan of approach is to take this road and go to the ridge. Over the ridge and through the east. Right. Thanks, Lollipop. We're on our way. Ms. Lee, please inform Rankin that the DART Team has located the terrorist camp. This is Marisa, I have something important. Tell Fu-- You tell me direct. She'll tell you nothing. You die, American bitch. Not likely. You murderer! Save your strength, scumbag. It would take a tougher man than you to pull apart industrial epoxy. So, what kind of junk they got you hooked on, huh? What do you think? The good stuff. * The camp should be a mile due west... here. * Oh, my-- Don't touch him. One false move and this is going to go sky high. Move back. Let's blow up the camp. * Lollipop, this is control. Are you under attack? Over. Negative. We cleared some booby traps. Come on in. Oh, I do hope that was painful for them. Hump, are your men ready? They're ready. And if they ain't ready, cats will be pulling my slugs out of their asses. Karen, Sherrie, Berry, get the squads up here now for a briefing, and I mean move it quick, fast. Come on, move it. Now, ya'll are going to get your chance, hmm? I'm talking hair. I'm talking heads, pig heads, hmm? Anybody brings me back a pig head gets one of my girls for half an hour, huh? You like that? Yeah. Do you understand? Pig head. They took the trail up the mountain. They've had a four-hour start. No problem. I'll scout ahead. Bring me the dancer. Ambush, 12:00. Hey, where are you going? You guys, you dirty guys, come back here. Cease fire. They are gone. Okay. Roger. I'll cool my tubes and sit out this dance. Oil. Oil. Oil. Suds. Suds. Suds. Okay, boys. Help yourself. Yeah. We need a shield. Bring up the congressman and the-- the beauty queen Wolf have the hots for. * Careful there, Wolf, she's just a little lady. She's all yours now, Wolfy. Oh, boy I ought to be charging admission on this one. Don't let that one get away, Wolfy. Tell me about the cave. Shhh, shhh, we're here to help you, okay? You crawl back to those trees and there's going to be somebody there to get you. Oh, thank God. Okay? Hey, Wolf. Wolf baby, how was it? Was it worth that long hard wait, Wolf? Just walk ahead of me. Hey, you ain't Wolf. What's happening? That's mine. Give me your spider. Not my spider. Give me it. Oh, shit. Nobody gets in here, do you understand? Snuff them out. There is to be no more retreating by my people. They took the congressman and the girl right from under Wolf's nose. Nose my ass, it was his big loaf. I have marvelous news Colonel Hump. We have a surprise guest. Someone has joined us by way of the rear entrance. Good, good. From Mohammad. The government forces are not likely to attack until well after dark. We have plenty of time for dinner before we have to leave. Shit. What? The trail should be clear. Mohammad saw no sign of the enemies troops in the back side of the mountain. This cave will be their death trap. The US authorities must pay a hefty toll for the harassment of my business operations. I have something to give them. Oh, Mohammad, you hunk. My hunk cowboy. Oh, my hunk. Oh, hunk, hunk. Oh, Rahji, you hunk. Rahji, Rahji, Rahji, Rahji, oh, you hunk Something's freaking biting me. Oh, man. God-- bit me. Too many drugs this time, boys. Too many drugs. * Right. Yeah! Hey, good work. Jolly good show, my boy. Oh, Kane, thank God. Thank God. * Hang tight Lollipop, I'll get my way through to you. Hey, Foxy, bring up my grenade launcher. * Hey, Slanker, come on, we're snuffing these people. Actually, I think the gentleman has decided to remain with us. You rather like it here, don't you? Fire in the hole. You made short work at these guys. No problem. Watch out. * All right, Ready? Here, One-- No, I hate needles, no. It's going to hurt. Oh. * All right, Its bedtime for you, bonzo, come on. How did you get out here? A bomb. Look out. * Over here, over here. Yeah. yeah. We'll get back Yes, God. I can't believe it, I thought we're never going to get out of this alive. Oh, you know, it was good of Vijay Rankin to lend us the house for rest and debriefing. Yes, it's lovely. God, I am so nervous. I hope it doesn't show. No, you're doing fine. It won't be long now. You know I heard from the president today, he offered us his-- I will slit your children's throats before your very eyes. You have predictable habits, Mr. Brent. I have kept this house under constant surveillance. Oh, I know. Oh, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. I have never killed women before, but in this case, I just might make an exception. Jennifer, my dear, you're right on target. The trap was perfect. If you ever decide to leave DART Team, remember, I have a position opened for you on my staff. Thanks, Vijay, I'll keep that in mind. Over. That's for saving my ass back there. Oh, its worth saving. You know, some things are difficult for young boys to deal with. Women can be challenge in any games. Uh-uh. And so can boys at any age. Tell me Steve, how do you deal with it? Well, as a DART man, I'm trained to take advantage of every situation. It's open. * I don't know when or where * I missed my chances * Maybe it's unfair * To skip your fine glances * * But I've danced before and the song had to end * * You bring music once more * Can this be our song * My friend? * So take me high * Lead me to every twist and turn * * So take me high * I won't stop until each step I learn * * So take me high * I'll close my eyes * While you're gone * And keep on dancing * Even if the music's gone * I've been here before, but the feeling's new * * And I'm dancing once more * This feeling's got to do * My friend * So take me high * Lead me to every twist and turn * * So take me high * I won't stop until each step I learn * * So take me high * I'll close my eyes * While you're gone * And keep on dancing * Keep on dancing * Keep on dancing * Even if the music stops * So take me high * Keep on dancing * Yeah, take me high * Keep on moving * Take me high * Keep on flying * So, take me high * Keep on dancing * Yeah, take me high * You got to keep on moving * * Take me high * Keep on, keep on, yeah * Yeah, keep on dancing * Keep on dancing * Keep on dancing * Even if the music's gone
