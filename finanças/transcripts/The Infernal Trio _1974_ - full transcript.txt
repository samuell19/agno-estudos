Georges Sarret, Captain of the 8th mountain artillery battalion, Medal of Honour,11 reputations, Knight in the Legion of Honour, in the name of the president and due to the power of attorney, we nominate you "Officer of the Legion of Honour." -But Philo, I... -The street is my future. I have nothing, no money, no flat, nothing. But you know, I can't marry you, I explained it to you. My wife disappeared. And we were not divorced. -Go away. go away -Philo, I love you... and don't make any noise, we have a dead person in here. -Philo, I love you... -Go away. -Death came and took her home. -But well, she was nearly ninety-two. She loved you a great deal. At your service. Maitre Georges Sarret, lawyer. Come, come... -Little French officer, come on. In German, please. Why is Villette not going to marry you? His wife disappeared, He never saw her again. It's war... War... is guilty of everything. If there can't be adduced a proof of his wife's death, a divorce is impossible. The man isn't foolish. Do you love him? Georges, I have to marry to become French. Marriage is a good idea. With your Villette, of course. Everything will be fine. I found your wife, Madame Villette. Worried? As expected, Madam Villette née Leoni Galone is dead. She doesn't exist any more. Dead, as you wished. I would like to hear it in your own words. Are you well? Yes, she is dead, it's very sad. I don't know what to say. Death certificate, registry office Mühlhausen. Conveyance deed to the grave. Public cemetery. Thirty years. I had the inscription renewed in gold. I was treated very courteously there. -We will bring her flowers, dear. -My Darling. Attention, no talking. Please don't move How are you? Correct? My little sister. Don't touch it, not my hair. Perhaps I killed your father, as I was a soldier. Odd, isn't it? A visitor. It's me. Can I come in? Just a moment, Madame Villette. Catherine, your sister is here. See how fine she looks in white. Have a seat. Something to drink? I'm bored downstairs. I leave you two on your own. You both have a lot to talk about. I'll spend time with your husband. Get up. -Get up. -Why. Slut. Be kind to each other. Come on, Philomena, give your sister a kiss. Catherine, give your sister a kiss. Philomena, kiss your sister. My medicine. Are you going out? Come, get in there. Put it there, please. No, leave it... leave it alone. -Could you please move the beds next to each other? -Yes, Monsieur. Wait, I help you. Come here, my sweet. Here, take it. Here Paris, here pleasure, here young lady. Would you like to be French? Want to be rich? Very rich? Want to marry? Do you know about a white wedding? -With you? -With me... A white wedding... Simple. - Monsieur Georges? - Have a seat. Tell me, what are you living on at the moment? - Very little? - It is enough for me. You are going to marry a beautiful young girl. It's a small order from a German client. War damage. -A girl in her best age. her name is Catherine. -Marry? I like being alone. - Definitely not. - Yes, Monsieur Georges. You don't know her, she is twenty years old. -Is she blond? -Dark. A dark-haired German girl. Very beautiful and hard-working. Yes, but my Manie. What is about my Manie-game? You will play Manie every day. The young girl wants to be French. We will help her. It's our obligation. She will be French, because she will be Madame Detreuil. May I see her? When can I see her? -Isn't the big sister there? -My poor, if you only knew... Lucky? -Very lucky. - Here is the money. I'm glad that you weren't there. It was gruesome. -He was sympathetic. -Very. We should have insured him. A life insurance. And now? We insure the next man. Did you have any heart trouble? Lung? The stomach, the kidneys? The sensory organs? What? The sensory organs? You've explained that you haven't concealed anything from me, about your present and past health? - Yes. You are a real friend. Tell it your doctor tomorrow. -Which doctor? -The doctor of the insurance company. Of the insurance company? Why? Detreuil would like to have an insurance, now he has a family. -A life insurance? -A life insurance. -In favour of his charming wife. -Charming. No company will insure him in his condition. He's a ruin. You go through the customary examinations and under-sign the contract. Instead of Detreuil. -How much? -Five Exercise, please. The signature is simple. A childish handwriting. No sense at all. L, no double L. Entitled in case of death? My wife, Catherine Detreuil. Detreuil. In your condition, you will live to a hundred. Payment in a case of bereavement, will give you peace, perhaps luck for your future. The world is a sorrowful place, but the fund will help you to pass through without fear.

Please notice that. And how do you call such little financial transaction? -General expenses. -I call it theft. 132.600 Franc remaining,I divide in two parts. 66300 Franc for me, 66300 Franc for you. What will you two do... with this money? We are going to Paris. We will send you a picture postcard. Come on, let's go. Noemie, may I take off my jacket? The meal warms me up. Feel free. Do you know, the Suez-stocks at the stock market are recommended? They are stable. Could be a little bit more saffron in it. -No. -Not at all. Haven't you been a missionary in Cambodia? Yes, I met him during my return trip on the ship. Love at first sight. Exactly on the equator. He had a problem with god.And the younger Chinese at the missionary school. But with my help he outgrew that. -How much do you want? -500, Madam. - 250. - That is poor. -You collect antique objects? -She lends small amounts against a deposit. Perhaps we should use some dealings of our friend, Maitre Sarret. No. Gold. I'm like Saint Thomas. I only believe in what I see. Gold doesn't lie. I'm here. You're here. -Was it nice in Paris? -I don't know. Come here. -I'm delighted to see you. -Kiss me. Come on. It is not the right moment. Just kiss me. Aren't you pleased to see me? - I am delighted. I told you before. -Then kiss me. -I'm delighted. -Kiss Me. What a nice hat. Nice hat. Kiss Me. Everything expensive... very expensive. A tall, pretty, high-class whore. You're mad. -No. You're mad. -Do I blame you? -Aren't you happy to see me? -Get out, get out of here, do you hear? - Go out of my sight. Get out. -You embarrass me. You mad. Insane. No, come here, do you hear? Come here. Undress. I'm waiting. I don't want to, I'm embarrassing you you miserable ponce, you ponce... Father. Are you there? -She's obscene. -Yes, isn't it? -And he's not exactly ugly. -If you think... Do you know how big her fortune is? Accurate to francs and centimes. I even know how they acquired it. I like you, you always act so confident in what you say. With a man like you, even a murderer have a chance to save his head. It was worth a look, wasn't it? Money disgusts me. It kills love. These thoughts are not my doing. My dear. So, 50-50. -Don't tickle me. -No, stop it now. Get down. Put your head down. It is not working this way. Sit up. We need two bathtubs. Philomena, Catherine. Help me. Do something. Let's leave it there for now. Be careful. -Not everything. -Come on, lend a hand. How do you spell "Merry Christmas" in French? Don't, Noemie. Let's do it now, we'll have tomorrow off. Catherine, Stop that tinkling. I can't hear myself think. Let her amuse herself. It's not every day we celebrate. I enjoy life, I take it by the horns. The Father always sees only the bad, he has no talent for happiness. Father always says happiness is for fools. Let go. Go away. Leave it. Take the legs The legs. Father Christmas arrives in the evening. Tomorrow at 2pm at my notary, Maître Perrin. Practice all night if necessary. Tomorrow at 11 o'clock you will be Chambon... You will be Chambon. A Monsieur Chambon is going to sign a letter of attorney to lawyer Sarret. Present here. Try to appreciate my faith in you. The lovely Chambon. The parting is on the right. -Perfect, Monsieur Chambon. Rest assured, we know lawyer Sarret very well. Beautiful. Isn't it a little eccentric? I must be mad. I'll buy it. I'll leave a deposit. How much Monsieur Chambon? I am not Chambon, Madame. I am a colleague. I don't negotiate with colleagues. I would like to speak to the owner. -He's in Switzerland. -What is he doing there? A unfortunate love story. An false ardour. A jealous husband. Flee. Escape. Italian lakes, clouds, danger. Love, Madame. -I have to know this man. Couldn't you make him return? -Difficult. Secretly. Without money. Perhaps we can... help him with a train ticket. Including return journey, of course. - Monsieur Chambon has arrived. -Welcome. -How was it in Switzerland? -Clean, very clean. Monsieur Chambon, A little signature, please. I'm coming. Don't speak with your mouth full. Stupid cow. Up here and wash it off Yes, something, but I don't know what. But what? That is, what it is about. What is it? That's why I called you. In Marseille are these kinds of smell... Yes, Marseille. That's right. But we are in Akes. I am sorry, but I don't smell anything. It smell a little bit like... like a pigsty. Don't talk nonsense I don't have a pigsty. This is an insult. You can't deny the smell. The man who leased this house is known to be very honourable. Maître Sarret bestows a great deal of money to the diocese and you want to accuse him? What do you want to do? A trial? Against Master Sarret and his relations? Besides, I assure you, I smell nothing. That's easy for you to say. You don't have to live here. Well Monsieur, don't be alarmed. To sell now is not the right moment. To sell now is not the right moment. Falling trend in the stock-market. - For you there never is the right moment. Georges, do you think we are beginners? I'll bring you the dessert. Jewellery? Come on, that's not real. My ladies. This is the future. There. If somebody would help me... a man who has a year to live. If that. One year? I'll make him a gift to you. Good evening, Monsieur. Can you repair the heel? -Are you feeling better, today? If a beautiful woman showed concern... like now. I would always be in good health. I have your documents with me. And a rosary. -It will help you. - It isn't that bad. Really? -Name? -Delorenzo. -First name? - Alberto. -Profession? -Shoemaker.. -Legal heir in case of death? - Maître Georges Sarret. Do you have any heart, lung, stomach, kidney disease or disease of the sensory organs? Of sensory organs. You understand that you conceal nothing about your actual fitness, as well as your fitness in the past? Except smoking. The world is a sorrowful place, but due to the Fratanelle the sun will shine eventually. Always at your service, Monsieur. Don't hesitate to engage us again. Faster. Have you thought about your future? About your children? About your parents? A life insurance will let you be free from such problems. This is an excellent idea. Imagine, Catherine would subscribe 5 insurances. -Why not ten? - That's too much, five are enough. five contracts in five different cities. Why me and not philomena? The younger the insurant, the fewer the bonus. Five contracts signed by Catherine Schmidt, in favour of Philomena Schmidt. -But I don't want to die. -No, in due course... At the right moment, Philomena will find a hopelessly sick girl... ready to die. Let's say, from tuberculosis. We'll wait for her to die a natural death. And who we pass off as Catherine Schmidt. -Well, ladies? -Hats off. Hats off. My husband died and left a remarkable fortune, But alas, no child. No heirs. So I decided, to use my fortune to benefit someone. To find a poor girl. For example an young orphan. God prescribes us our tasks, doesn't he, Doctor? Can I rely on you? Good. It's expensive. The movement does not depend on me. This scandal does not affect them. I withdraw my candidacy for the May elections without bitterness, so I can fight better, you'll thank me for it. -But I insist on your nomination. We vote. ...in my place, my friend, Georges Sarret. Who is best placed to bear this heavy responsibility. Chest out a little. Maître, the telephone. I beg your pardon. Maître, I am afraid, it is a little bit too much for us. - Am I good here? -Yes this is good. These bonuses each quarter... plus the pensions the cost of everything. -Do you have a problem with the due date? -Due date? I beg you. Beginning, middle and end of a month. Did you at least find Catherine's future cadaver? I'm tired of paying premiums. Find the rare little bird if you're so great. -Do I seem like a charitable lady? What should I say? Catherine signed the insurance in your favour, it's perfectly legal. You find a body to take her place in the coffin. I never had any problems with insurances. I'll pay somehow, like always. Or I'll kill my sister to get the money. You're a monster. I notify you immediately. She was admitted eight days ago, and I'm sure I'm not mistaken. She is very, very ill. malnourished, neglected, lungs like rags... A very ragged heart, a miserable life. She would be too much work for us. She needs dedicated care. -Is she alone? -Of course, no family. An orphan. I can guarantee. How kind you are. It is... forgive me, Lord, but this is a miracle. I think philomena... has found her. -Is it true? -I hope so. How nice it would be, if it were over. -Not bad? -Very good. It inspires... confidence. People don't elect just anybody. I shouldn't have come back. Tell me your name today, will you? And here. Nice, isn't it? Am I getting on your nerves? Fine. I'll go if you want. And I will never come back. Stay. My name is Magali Herbin. Finally. My child. I just want to help you, do you understand? Try to thank the good Lord. Get your clothes on. You are shameless. I'm sad. You remind me of your sister. There is the new Catherine Schmidt. Widowed Detreuil. Hermine, this is Magali. Hermine will look after you. Exclusively for you. Splendid. I'll get the camphor. Stay here, Catherine. Stay with her, Hermine. Do you remember? He was a brave man. We will dine out wonderfully with her. Much drinking, much smoking, much sleeping. -Then kill her. -Can I go out with you? Consumptives are strange. Deep despair and depression, but also a enormous hunger for life. It has a strong effect on sexual behaviour. Maître Sarret has his midday tantrum. What kind of tantrum? Catherine, my dear, your sister has fulfilled her mission spectacularly. Now it is your turn. You are going to seduce the young girl. Spend your nights with her for several months. But I'm not interested in women, Georges. It doesn't matter. What does Philomena think? If Catherine agrees... I will, of course, agree to this arrangement. You're coughing? Here. Give that to the man and ask him... to change the money, and he will give you tokens. Then you can play. You won. Are you happy? Hermine, get chips. You're late. You old pig. Was he good, your kanake? One thousand and one nights. Here... For your cravat. I'm hungry. Sugar? Take a seat. And when Madame comes home? I baked the cake myself, Magali. Blow them all out at once. -And if one remains... -Then you are going to get married this year. - May I have another try? Very good. I'm tired. How pretty. Do you like it? I'm going to bed. Hermine, it's me. You can't even waltz. -It's Catherine. -I'm not to blame Such an idiot. You're to blame. They'll pay. The insurance companies pay. -To whom do they pay? -To you. philomena Schmidt, widowed Villette... and wife of Sarret. Isn't your little sister here? Danger. Don't move anymore. Don't move. And a little smile.
