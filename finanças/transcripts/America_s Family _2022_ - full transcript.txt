She believed the best way to safeguard his spirit was to keep him close. And when she couldn't, she made sure he was safe and tucked away. [baby cooing] -[slaps] -But she was less protective of herself. -[baby fussing] -[bus engine starting] ["The Andes Groove" by Raul Pacheco] [Valentina] My father is from San Salvador, El Salvador, and he began looking out for our family long before we ever came into this world. [speaking Spanish] He likes being useful, working hard. It didn't matter that he started at the bottom... because he always had his eye on the future. [music continues] My mom came to the US hoping to find a new life. But to hear my father tell it, she really came to find him. Together, they believed in the American Dream. [laughs] [Valentina in English] I always felt trapped as a kid. -[ringing] -Valentina! [Valentina] Having epilepsy was hard on all of us... but Koke found his escape in the waves. [upbeat surfing music] Koke is a nickname for Jorge. When my mother met my dad and found out they had the same name, she took it as a sign that he was destined to be Koke's true father. -[record scratching] -Again, with the surfing. You should have been in school. [Valentina] But they didn't see it that way. You're wasting your time with the surfing stuff. [Valentina] Trouble always seems to find Koke. Are you wasted? Get out. [door shuts] -[engine revving] -[siren wails] Shit! [Valentina] My brother Emiliano is like the opposite of Koke. He works hard like my dad... and yet it never seems to be enough. -Hola, Emil, good morning. -Good morning! I finished the Creighton discovery doc you needed last night. Can you go to that CHIRLA meeting? You don't have to be there very long. Just go talk about our pro bono work, all right? That's good. Okay. Okay. I know this is frustrating, but nothing is happening overnight. I have three friends who've lost their homes. If we get pushed out of our homes, we have no protection from ICE. Don't say that. You have us. You have your communities. Some of your churches offer Sanctuary programs that can protect you. Not if you have your deportation order. Sorry, and who are you? Hi, I'm-- I'm from Hillman Meyers, an attorney. So you're an immigration attorney? -No. Um- -[people clamoring] But if you're worried about getting deported, you need one. -Obviously! -[people chattering] [Valentina] Koke and Emiliano have always been kind of competitive. -[giggling] -You know, it's not that hard to get an apartment. Get a second job cleaning surfboards or something. [water splashing] You're a dick, Milo. We're gonna get our own place soon, I promise. It's me and you against the world, baby. Me and you. [Valentina] Koke's only had one girlfriend his whole life. And he loves her. -[knocking] -Hey! -[woman moaning] -Really, really loves her. And that's how we got Esperanza. [woman] Happy Thanksgiving, America! The fourth Thursday in November kicks off the holiday season and the biggest shopping day of the year, celebrating gratefulness by eating, eating, eating, watching the parade or American football, and honoring the pilgrims, European immigrants who after nearly obliterating the lives and culture of indigenous peoples declared America home. -[family chattering] -Thank you. [Jorge] Let me get some of this Turkey. [Valentina] Ah, you did so good. [Jorge] Some turkey here. [chattering] -Where are you going? -We go in tomorrow. Sit down, sit down. Dinner. Pass me that wine. Sit down. -It's Thanksgiving, Milo. -Pass me the wine bottle. We were an American family, like any American family... until the day that we weren't. [device powers off] ["El Invento" by Jose Gonzalez] [bus rumbling] [cell phone rings] Good morning, Mom. Hi. Oh, thank you! Sweet dreams. [door closes] -Okay, see you! -Bye! Pick her up at six!

[phone rings] [officer] You know you've had a final order of deportation in 2005. You failed to show up for a court hearing due to an underage driving charge, and the judge ordered you to leave the country. I went to court for that. Those charges were dropped. I want call my family. Well, maybe you went to county court. You should have also gone to immigration court. [dialing] [rings] Sorry. Where I am? Downtown federal building. B18. Time's up.

Every week, right on time. Thank you for not forgetting about us. [chuckles] Even on the holiday, which is more than I can say for my receptionist. -[phone rings] -Oh, excuse me. -Hello? -Mom was picked up by ICE! Did you hear me? [car alarm disarms] [Emiliano pants] [in English] Do-- do you mind if I use your bathroom? Go right ahead. Everything okay? [knocking] -Can I help you? -Can we come in please? What do you need? We're looking for someone. You have a warrant? Can I speak to your supervisor? [chuckles] Who do you suggest? God? Without a warrant I can't give you permission to search this building. Is there anything else? Then I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. [footsteps receding] [knocking] I am not a criminal. That didn't even cross my mind. My son just called, my wife has been arrested, and she's not a criminal either. I'm looking for Marisol Diaz? Um, we're heading into Shabbat. You can stay here. For now anyway. -Thank you, Sister. -[chuckles] Rabbi. Oh, that's right. Rabbi. They took her to Mira Loma already. The bus just left. The board is gonna to have some questions. Mira Loma? Where's that? Do you mind if I ask you, what is your immigration status? I am from El Salvador, but I've had temporary protective status for over 25 years here. But the administration just took that away. It's Koke, leave a message and I'll get back to you. Call me, Koke! [phone rings] -Hello? -I've been trying to call you all morning. Yeah, I just got the messages. Have you talked to Koke? I only talked to Angie. She's on her way over here now. Mom is already in a detention center. Is she okay? Yeah, I'm trying to find out. I'll call you back. No Milo, Milo, please don't hang up. ["Camino a Mira Loma" by Roberto Hermosillo] [phone rings] It's Koke, leave a message, and I'll get back to you. [car rumbling] I'm looking for Marisol Diaz. Do you know her A-number? Her-- her what? Her A-number. -Marisol Diaz? -Mm-hmm. A-number 0-6-9-1-2-6-0-6-4. Yeah, can I see her? -You have an appointment? -I'm her lawyer. There is no G28 form on file. I'm also her son. You have to make an appointment. Call them on Monday. Monday?

Holy shit. You're already out of the country! -Are you okay? -I'm fine. How's Mom? I saw her going out as I was walking in. -B18 downtown? -Yeah! I was there, where were you? They said I had a final deportation letter. And they put me in a room and they said to wait there for the bus. I wasn't even there long. What? A final deportation order for what? Joyriding. When we were kids, Koke? Yeah. They said they sent a bunch of letters, but I never got anything. I don't have shit, Milo. I don't have my phone. I don't have my wallet. [Emiliano] Where are you? [Koke] At the border they said that I could go to a shelter. I could be on my own. It's this place called Casa del Migrante. I'm only allowed one call. Can you please call Angie? -[Emiliano] Yeah, and Koke? -Mm-hmm? [Emiliano] Please take care of yourself. [melancholy music] [people chatting] [music continues] -Your brother got deported. -[sobs] [pigeons cooing] [Bob] Your father's in physical sanctuary, right? He should be safe for now. Look, I'm sorry about your mother and not our department, you know that the firm only works with institutional clients. Family immigration is not-- I know. But I need help. Can you make a referral? I'll make a few calls. -Thank you. -Hello, Emily? Can you get Father Patrick? No, no, no. His home is good. Thank you. [traffic rumbling] [Angie on phone] Hello? [Koke] Hi. Hey, hold on one second. Let me walk-- I'm walking outside right now, hold on, -hold on, hello? -[Angie] Okay. Hi. Hi. -Hey! -[Angie] Hey! [Angie] Hello? Yeah, I can hear you, hi! [Angie] Oh, thank God. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. This guy here is letting me use his phone. Milo tells me you're in a shelter. Baby, here, color. -[Koke] How's Esperanza? -[phone rings] Confused. She misses you, and your parents, especially your mom. [Angie] Baby, here. -[Esperanza frets] -[Angie] Baby, please stop. -You're at work? -Yeah, I had to bring her. -How's my mom? -They can't see her until next week. Fuck. I miss you. [Angie] I miss you too. I think we should get married. Are you seriously asking me to marry you, right now? Yes. [Angie] We're in two different countries, Koke! Milo said he's gonna get me out. -When? -I don't know. Jail? Okay. [computer keys clicking] The temple is in no position to harbor people. We're talking about one person, right? His son is a lawyer and suggested that he stay here. From what I understand, Jorge has had temporary protective status for over 25 years. What was he doing here? Delivering Challah for the services. He comes every Friday. So he's working here illegally. You want me to be the bad guy? Fine. I'll be the bad guy. He's probably a very nice person. But our responsibility is to the synagogue. There are synagogues participating in the Sanctuary Movement all over the country. We are not joining the Sanctuary Movement overnight. That would require full board approval. The building doesn't even have a shower for God's sake. Actually, there is a bathroom in my office with a shower. [speaking Hebrew] "We shall not wrong nor oppress a stranger for we were strangers in the land of Egypt." I'm not gonna dispute liturgy with you, Leah. He's already here, Max, and he needs our help. Do you want to make a motion? Yes. I want to make a motion that we offer this man physical sanctuary here in the synagogue. -Second. -Wait a minute. What about the rest of the board? I think that we should decide what we are going to offer for the short term, now. All in favor? [bird cawing] -Oh, Ms. Garcia. -You got five minutes. Bob tells me that your mom is at Mira Loma? Yes. I have an appointment to see her tomorrow morning. My brother has been deported. My father is in religious sanctuary. I'm an American citizen. Can my mother immigrate through me? That depends. How did she get here? -The desert. -Then no. Now your father, on the other hand, if he has never been deported, and he got here lawfully, then you can petition for him. -You're 21, right? -24. Okay, so then you can file for the I-130 Family Petition. Has your mother ever petitioned for relief? I think so, years ago when the notary got my father the TPS I think they tried to get her something because of my sister. She's 17 and has epilepsy. Okay, then you can file for a cancellation of removal for caring for a citizen minor. I can see your mother... next Friday. She's already been there a week. Listen, I have court. So if you need this done sooner, you're gonna have to do it. -Do what? -Represent your mother. I-- I'm not an immigration attorney. You won't be the first lawyer to learn on the job. I'm barely a first year associate. I've been doing document review. Then you will have no problem doing the research. I wouldn't even know where to start. Talk to your mother. And file that I-130 Family Petition for your father. And don't forget the I-485 Application for Adjustment. The forms are on the USCIS website. Now go. You don't have a lot of time. [phone rings] I know, Dad, so does she. [sighs] [grunting] [wind howling] [Emiliano] [sighs] [tapping] Yes, she's with Angie. [people chattering] [crowd chanting] We are boycotting the conditions of the detention center. -My mom is in there. -We're trying to start a legal clinic. Most of these people don't even have attorneys. -[chanting continues] -Thank you. Nice to see you again. Why didn't you tell that woman you were a lawyer? I'm not an immigration attorney, Tina. You're gonna have to take the bus when we get into LA. -What? -I'm already way too late for work. You want me to hit my head and wake up in another city? You haven't had a seizure in over a year. And if you're worried about it, your helmet is in the trunk. I'm not wearing that thing. Okay, fine, Tina. Do what you want. [chanting continues faintly] Honey, drink. Surely, it's good for your stomach. [protesters chanting] Oh, ah, let me help you with that, Rabbi Oh, thank you. I'm just taking it to my car. -Got it. -Thanks. [police siren wailing] You know what? I want to show you something. We used to use this room for our temple daycare. [keys jangling] [door creaks] Some of our congregants donated stuff from their homes. This should be more comfortable than the conference room. [chuckles] Oh, we have a lot of bubbes here at the temple. -A what? -Jewish grandmas. Oh. Expect some home cooked meals. [both chuckling] Okay. Um, there is the fridge, there is the microwave. There's utensils in the drawer. Jorge, I'm so sorry. I have to officiate a wedding. Okay? Make yourself comfortable, all right? Thank you. [door creaks and closes] [sighs] [drawer rattles] [plastic crinkles] [cars honking] [sighs] Hello, Emil! I just got the email about HLS assignments. -Oh? -I'm not on the list. Oh, well, you've got other cases. Is there a problem with my work? No, no problem. It's a tricky case though. -Lots of reading. -[Emiliano scoffs] There is always a lot to read. Well, why don't you focus on the cases that you've got? If I don't get new assignments, I won't advance. Well, it's not always about you, Emil. You're responsible to your clients and you're distracted. I don't blame you. I told you something about my family in confidence. It's not right for you to hold it against me. Everyone here has a vulnerability. You just happen to know mine. Nobody's holding anything against you, Emil. I had hoped that someone like you would appreciate that. -Someone like me? -Yeah. Well, don't take it that way. Well, what I mean to say is, you've had plenty of opportunity at this firm. Scouring contracts that screw workers while billing hundreds of hours for the firm for it? Those kinds of opportunities? -Emil! -Bob! I have always put this firm first. Always! You know what? Don't worry about pushing me out, because I quit. [melancholy music] [music continues] [sighs] [papers rustling] [phone keypad beeps] [phone line rings] -[Diana] Hello? -Hey. Uhhh, are you still looking for lawyers? [keypad clicking] [front door shuts] -Hey. -Hey. -Did you finish your homework? -A while ago. What about dinner? I ate something. What was I supposed to do? It's a long drive to Mom's hearing. -Valentina? -I know. Okay. Get to bed early, please. Okay. [judge] The request for a bond is denied. No, no, no. The human rights violations that Mrs. Diaz has experienced: no drinking water, no recreation, no sanitary protection or doctor attention, despite repeated requests. These are not problems I can resolve. And it doesn't make her any less of a flight risk to join her husband in sanctuary. I don't believe in sanctuary, counselor. And for this reason, I'm denying the bond. She'll have to wait in detention until I adjudicate the cancellation for removal. You promised she was getting out! I can't control the judge, Tina. I'll just have to try again. -When? -I don't know. Six months, maybe. She's gonna be in jail on Christmas? I can only appeal it Tina. I-- I'm trying to get her cancellation of removal by proving she has to take care of you. You don't know what you're doing. Do you have ten grand to pay a lawyer and send money to Koke and pay every fucking bill in this house? Right now I'm what we've got, me, I'm it. Won't you let me help you? Oh, please, Tina. I'm serious. What do we have to do? I have to prove that she has good moral character so I can file a waiver. -Okay, and how do you do that? -I don't know. By-- by getting letters from everyone we know... [voice distorts] ...to see that she's a good person. [engine starts] [office phone rings] This is the legal services unit? Why not? [cheerful music] -Have a little vision! -Okay. I have a BA in psych and a Master's in education. I know I'm just a restaurant hostess. It's just tough to get a job without papers. I'm not at Hillman Meyers anymore. That's why I am calling actually. Do you have any recent grads interested in public interest law? I'm waiting for my Bar results. I'm interested in the private sector. In between firms. Great! -Work here in the meantime! -[dings] [traffic rumbling] [sighs] [woman singing] -[Marisol] Excuse me? -Newbie! Thank you for drink. You're welcome. It's better, eh? -Yes. -[chuckles] Good. What in drink? Vinegar and starch root. It's good, right? Yes. I have friends in the kitchen, my people. -This is good. -What is that? Dinner. Can't eat the food they serve here. It's-- it's not good. [speaks in Haitian Creole] I make my own dinner here. Try. -Ah, no. -Newbie, try, believe me. Good. Eh? Eh, newbie! [singing] I like you newbie. [chuckles] [singing continues] [procession music] [bus door hisses] [music continues] [Koke] [music recedes] [car radio playing] [music continues] [singer vocalizing] [singer sings in Spanish] -[players chatter] -[song continues] [speaks in Spanish] [taxi driver] [dog barks] [car engine starts] [hands slapping] [birds cawing] [footsteps falling] [dog barks] [Tacho] [waves lapping] [chuckles] [traffic rumbling] [keypad clicking] [beeping] [Valentina] My name is Valentina Diaz and I'm an American citizen. ICE came to my house looking for my brother to deport him. He wasn't home so they took my mother and now she's in detention. The only thing that we can do is to submit letters stating that she has good moral character and hope that it helps get her a bond next time. They found my brother and deported him. My father is in sanctuary because we're afraid that if he comes home that he could be arrested or deported too. [soft guitar music] I have something called Doose Syndrome. When I was a kid, I could have... more than a hundred seizures a day. I have been on this medical Keto diet, which seemed to have really helped. Only they-- they've been coming back. And if the seizures go back to the way that they were before... I'll probably have to have surgery. And I'm asking you to please help. [music continues] [messages pinging] [bird cawing] [waves lapping] [relaxing music] [waves lapping] [Tacho] ["Soy Pescador" By Lila Downs] [boat motor roars] [waves gently breaking] Hey! [greeting in Spanish] Wow! [surfer hip-hop music] ["Asi Son Mis Dias" by Control Machete] [prison door buzzes] You make this? Marisol, this is good. I like to cook. You're good at it! Can you believe they canceled all of the orientations? That was my last hope to get a lawyer. Hmm. My son is my lawyer. Your son is a lawyer? But it's my fault. I open door for immigration. It's always my fault. The father of my first son said to me, "Everything's going to be better here. We are going to be so happy here." But it's not true because when we come to this country, he beat me more than he beat me back home. But one day it is not enough that he hurt me. He hit my son just to get to me. When I see my son of five years on the floor... finally I go to the police and they help me. So when the police come to my house, I thought something really bad had happened. I don't trust the police. Never, never, never. You see me? Before I come here, I'm a nurse. A really good nurse. I work hard. All I do is work. I go home, I go to work. I go home, go work. One night after work, I go to the store to buy some food. Store manager, look at me. Everywhere I go, I think, "Ah, this guy is crazy." I have to go. I go to leave and he stop me and he says, "Hey, you, you steal something from my store." I said, "Me steal? No, I don't steal." He says, "Yes, you steal. I called the police." The police come. They search me. They don't find nothing. The store manager tell the police, "You don't find nothing because she eat the food." The police don't search the camera. They don't search nothing. They don't ask questions. They arrest me. They ask me, "Where you from?" I said, "I'm from Haiti." They say, "You have paper?" I said, "Yes, I have TPS." They say, "Oh no, TPS is no more." They bring me in front of a judge. The judge tell me I need to pay $35,000 to get out. All my money I sent to Haiti for my family. The judge says, "Well, go back to Haiti to your family." I say, "I can't go back to Haiti. The earthquake took my house. And if I go back to Haiti, surely I will die." So I tell the judge, "No, I have to appeal." Marisol, you say you have a son that is a lawyer. You are lucky. Tell your son to prepare everything. And when you get your day in court, you be strong. Don't say, "It's my fault, I'm blame." No, fight, Marisol! [speaking Hebrew] [congregation speaking Hebrew] Max, may your mother's memory be for a blessing and let us say, Amen. The Weisenberg family will be sitting Shiva all week. All are welcome. Our service continues on page eight. [birds chirping] Is everything okay? Is Esperanza-- Esperanza is fine. She's with my parents. I'm going to Tijuana to see Koke. He wants to get married. -What? -Milo? It's going to be a least ten year bar before he can come back. Yeah, I know, but I figured if we get married then you know we-- It doesn't matter. I wish it did, but it doesn't. All I've ever wanted was for us to settle down to start a family. Angie, you are part of this family. Believe me, you are the best decision that Koke ever made. But could you please just wait? Just give me a little bit more time to figure something out? [sighs] [phone rings] ["Xue Xua" by Dana Maman and Robert Easton] -[boat engine drones] -[birds chirping] [guitar plays] [Koke] [Grandma] ...in detention. [Koke weeping] [Koke sniffles] [fast-paced guitar music] [girl giggles] [traffic noises] [phone rings] Ma'am, please, here-- Sorry, I tried to tell her you were busy. God bless you and your family. Oh, thank you, ma'am. [chuckles] [envelope rustling] [woman] While I do not personally know Marisol Diaz, from what I have learned, she is a good person. [message beeps] [Valentina on video] My name is Valentina Diaz and I'm an American citizen. -ICE came to my-- -[door slams] Where were you? Out with my friends. You're too young to be out like that. Why didn't you text me? You don't text back half of the time. And you're never home before 11 o'clock anyway. Why do you care? Have you been drinking? That's too much sugar, Valentina! I haven't had anything to eat all day. I have to get my blood sugar up. So are you trying to trigger a seizure or what? -Too late. -What does that mean? What does that mean? I had a small one after Mira Loma. I've had a few while sleeping. Why didn't you tell me? They were in the middle of the night, when would I tell you? -[door slams] -You're not a little kid Valentina. You could have said something. You need to go to the doctor. Who's going to take me? You're never here. I already went to the doctor anyway. What did he say? If it gets worse, I have to go to the hospital, get evaluated for medications we can't afford. Have you been posting online about the family? You told me we needed to show that Mom's a good person. Letters are coming in, Milo. From people who don't even know her. I'm trying to show the judge that Mom has a real case and you're turning it into a fucking circus. I have just as much of a right to help my mother as you do. Okay. Fine, Valentina. [writing pad rustles] When was the last time you even talked to Koke? I text Dad every day. He says you don't even call him. I told him we're in the same house and you don't even talk to me. I'm dealing with a lot of shit you don't even know about. Well then why won't you tell me? Talk to me. Look, you know that I can take anything you have to tell me, right? -I ac-- -Whatever you think you know, Valentina, I'm not talking about this right now. Of course. Just ignore me as usual. Why don't you just admit that you're scared? That you're just as freaked out as the rest of us instead of screwing everything up? You don't think I remember those 49 minutes every single day? 49 minutes when I could have gone to B18 and made sure that she never went to Mira Loma. That I could have warned my brother. You don't think I feel like shit that I never filed to adjust Dad's status before now? You think I don't know I fucked up? I know I fucked up. -[buzzing] -Valentina? [gasping] [Valentina moans] [Emiliano breathes heavily] I got you. [melancholy piano music] ["Una Dulce Canción" by Raul Pacheco] [Angie] Oh, my God. [both laughing] -[Angie] Let me see you. -I'm good. These aren't even my clothes. I got you something. -Oh, what? -You like it? -Thank you. -You're welcome. [kiss smacks] In case Milo didn't send enough. I got something for you too. -[Angie gasps] -My birth certificate. Finally. This is great for you, Koke. It's great for us. It's great for us. Now that we're together, I want to do this properly. [music stops abruptly] [Koke voiceover] I wish our reunion would've gone like that. It didn't. [both chuckling] You spent a lot, huh? It's the same as a room in LA. -That's a lot here. -[Angie chuckles] Yeah. You want a shot? -Uh... -A toast to us? No thanks. [liquor pouring] ["Moving On" by Raul Pacheco] [Koke swallows] [glass bangs] ♪ Are you ready to move on? ♪ Since when did you started drinking like that? Since I can no longer see my wife and kid. Right? You never got back to me about that. Koke... They don't let you drink at the Casa. I just bought it on the way here. Okay. -Come here. -[Angie laughs] -I missed you. -I missed you too. So much. [Angie whimpers] Koke, no, stop! We'll just get all wrapped up and distracted. And that's how we ended up in this mess in the first place. What are you saying? That you regret that I'm Esperanza's father? Of course not. Why didn't you bring her? She's still little, Koke. Does she ask about me? All the time. Your parents wouldn't let her see me huh? Your family? Milo didn't think it was a good idea. What the fuck does Milo get to say about it, huh? He says it'll be at least ten years before you can come back. That can't be right. -Or maybe never. -Well I don't believe him. And if that's the case, well, why don't you come stay here with me? Here? Yeah. Until we figure it out. We can't afford to live here, Koke. Well I'll work. I got my birth certificate now. I could get a job. Two jobs. It doesn't matter. -You could work here too. -I don't speak Spanish. Can you please try to make this work? I practically begged you to marry me for years. Well, I wasn't gonna marry you living at home and broke. Your parents already think I'm not shit. Your father can't even look me in the eye. Well, what do you think they think now? It's humiliating. Humiliating for you? I was trying to save money so we could get a house so we can do things right. So I can show your parents that I can take care of you. Well, you took too long. ♪ How very you ♪ [singer vocalizing] [zipper opening] Got you a phone. Here's some cash. -I don't want your money. -Take it! [singer vocalizing] [Koke sniffs] [music continues] What are you doing telling her not to marry me? I didn't tell her not to marry you, Koke. I just told her that nothing is going to change legally, even if she does. She was coming to you as a brother. She wasn't looking for legal advice. What about Esperanza? Have you thought about her? -She's all I think about! -It's a ten year bar, Koke. You've committed a crime. They have your prints. I was a kid. Everybody fucks up as a kid. No, everybody doesn't. And even if they do, we are not everybody. I'm so sick of you and your self righteous bullshit. I don't remember you working a goddamn day when you were in law school. I never asked you for shit. Oh, yeah. Well, who was the one paying the mortgage, huh? Who was the one busting his ass every day in the kitchen next to Dad? Don't blame me for your bad choices, Koke. I was a great surfer as a kid. I could have gone pro, man. Not everyone got your opportunities, Milo. You're mad at me for becoming a lawyer when being a lawyer was the only way I could think of to get us out of the shit situation that we were in? And I've made just as many sacrifices for this family as you ever did, including for your daughter, who forgive me if I'm not gonna let you fuck her up like you have fucked up everything else. [people chattering] Can I get out please? [in Spanish] Can you please open the door? Please! Please! Hey, mail just came in. -You okay? -Mm-hmm. -[footsteps receding] -[melancholy music] [envelope crinkles] [chuckles] [sighs] [traffic rumbles] -[knocks] -Yes? Rabbi, do you have a minute? Yes. My son called. The letter came in documenting my case file. I can go home. Oh, that's great, Jorge. Rabbi, thank you for everything. It's my pleasure, Jorge. [chuckles] Jorge? Um... I noticed you praying at night behind the screen? Yes, I know it's a little strange. No, um, not so strange. My grandmother used to pray in private. Oh, I got it from my grandmother. Huh... Did she used to shuckle, too? Shuckle? Yeah, um, you know. Ah, I guess yes. I guess she did. Huh? You said she was from El Salvador? Oh, everyone originally from Spain, but that was way, way back. Wait. Um, have you ever heard of the Crypto Jews, also known as the Marranos? The what? Well, hundreds of years ago, Jews were forced to leave Spain, or else convert to Catholicism. You know, only the very religious Jews shuckle the way that you do. You think I'm Jewish? Well, you do make the best challah I've ever had. [both chuckling] I mean, this is largely an Ashkenazi community, but, you know, Jews come from all over the world. I think it might be worth looking into. Whether you're Jewish or not, Jorge, we're really glad you've been with us. Rabbi... I've been reading the English prayer book. Oh, yeah? What does the Torah say... about a man who has failed his family? Well, there's something called Teshuva... but I'm not sure that applies to what you're asking for. Things are very polarized right now... and our immigration system is very broken. This kind of division is not something that Jews really believe in. "Sh'ma yisrael adonai eloheinu adonai ehad." What does that mean? It means we are all connected... and God is in every one of us... and we are all one. [Rabbi Tova praying in Hebrew] [birds chirp] -[knocking] -Yeah? [door opens] Someone wants to see you. Dad! [Valentina whimpers] I missed you so much. What are you doing? Oh, we just got a letter for Mom from the mayor. -What? -That makes 1,463 letters submitted. 1,400 what? 1,463 letters submitted!

I read the motion, but do you want to repeat it? We are asking for a reconsideration of bond for Marisol Diaz due to an extraordinary change in extenuating circumstances. Marisol Diaz's daughter, Valentina Diaz's epilepsy has worsened due to the stress of family separation. I sent you a letter from her doctor calling for a lengthy evaluation and the need for family stability and support. Marisol Diaz's husband, Jorge Diaz, is no longer in sanctuary at Temple Tarfon. In addition, I submitted almost 1,500 letters on Mrs. Diaz's behalf attesting to her good moral character. These included signed letters from Congresswoman Karen Bass, representative Maxine Waters, representative Hilda Solis, and one from Mayor Garcetti. The government objects, Your Honor. The sanctuary-movement is ongoing. Just because Mr. Diaz has left sanctuary doesn't mean he couldn't go back whenever he wants. Now we're going to hold it against her, for what her husband might do? The family petition for him. We've received a receipt. But she could go, Your Honor. He's not going back. I understand this is personal for you, counselor, but you need to calm down. -Please. I want talk? -Mom. No. I worry for my son because he is deported. He is not with his daughter. He is no with the mother of his daughter. I know my children. And my daughter need me. She no survive without me. Please. -[car rumbles] -[inspirational guitar music] [Marisol ululates] [music continues] [uplifting music] [Esperanza coos] Let's call Daddy!

[Emiliano] All right, let's go everybody. Let's go, we're late. [Festive music] [phone rings] -Hello? -[Emiliano] Hey, we're at the march in downtown LA. Are you in downtown TJ yet? Yeah! I'm on my way! [drums pound] Come on, we're waiting for you! -[upbeat music] -[crowd cheers] My name is Valentina Diaz and I wanna introduce to you my family. This is my mother, Marisol Diaz. She survived in a detention center. And this is my father Jorge Diaz, who came out of being in sanctuary. And next to him is my sister-in-law. The kindest person I know, Angie Pak. Next to her is my brother Emiliano. He's an attorney that is fighting with everything that he has, to keep our family together. And that little munchkin right there, that's Esperanza. She's the hope of our family. [sighs] And next is my brother and Esperanza's father. Koke Jorge Diaz. Koke now lives in Mexico where he was deported more than six months ago. But thanks to technology, he will be marching along with us today, with all of the other deportees from downtown Tijuana -towards the border. -[crowd cheers] My family is brown, Black, Salvadorian, Mexican, Korean, American, old and young, male and female. We are undocumented. We've been deported. We are citizen able and disabled. We are strong, we are proud. And we have the most important thing that keeps families together and that's love!
