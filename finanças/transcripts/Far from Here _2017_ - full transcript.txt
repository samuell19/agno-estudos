I need you here on this project. But I need your undivided commitment. Don't worry about last night, alright? I'm writing it down. Give me a sec. I've got a ton of stuff here. Listen... Grant! Where is the table? I sold it. Why? What do you mean why? We're leaving. Not tomorrow. Grant! -How dare you sell my table? -Your table? Yeah, it's my table because I bought it with my own money, you know? Yeah? Who did you sell it to? -I don't know. -OK, what's the number? I don't think I have it. Yeah, I don't have it. Grant, you're a fucking child. I am a child... Yes, you are! At least I am not a liar. What's that?! I've said at least I am not a liar. You said one year and we go home. -I said that because we have a project. -Fuck the project. -Fuck the what? -You and this goddamn project. -I wanna go home. -What are you saying...? I am home!

What are we doing here? -What are we doing here? -Yeah. You see this building? Look at the state it's in. Well... We've been contracted to supervise the design and development of a new maternity hospital. And I was thinking... Would you like to be my second in command? Excuse me Hello. Hey, brother, man. There's not much time left. That is why we're all here together. We win together or we lose together. There's no reason to get upset if... Even with the budget constraints we've continued to move in the right direction. Ana left because she wasn't able to do her job. We simply won't let these problems get the better of us. Okay? Let's focus. When will you be finished? -A little. A couple of hours. -A little. -Good. -Excuse me a second, sorry... Okay, let's get to work. Iena... hello... Ienachi....God damnit!

Can you do it for me? And do something with that bird's nest on your face. I'd like to talk to my son. Has Catalin seen these specs? No, not yet. They're not making sense. When is the electrical inspection? I don't know. I'll check with Adriana and get back to you. -That's your responsibility. -Excuse me. Sofia. Are you okay? Yes, it's just a stomach ache. You don't look too good. Take the rest of the day off and go see the doctor. No, I'm fine, I can... No. Go see the doctor and get some rest. You can send me a revised budget tonight. Okay. The results are negative. We found no trace of infection. That's good. I've just been pushing myself a little too hard. My boss sent me here, otherwise I wouldn't have come. Of course. All normal symptoms for early stages of pregnancy. There must be... Have a seat. I propose we run some more blood work. A beta hCG test. So that we know for sure. Miss, this things happen...
