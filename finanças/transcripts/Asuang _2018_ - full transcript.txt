--== McEphie ==-- [lively music playing] Good afternoon, Albay! You know, I am so happy we are together this afternoon. And we have a very special guest for today. But before we meet him, we prepared a video for all of you. Here, watch this. Believe it or not, Asuang is Gugurang's brother. Back then, they still lived in peace and order. But Asuang got jealous of his brother's power. He wanted the power of the Sacred Fire into his own mountain. [Haliya] My enchanted mask is gone! Asuang ruined my reputation! He stole my moon! You know why he did that? Because that is what the demon really looks like when the moon shines on his face! [Damiana] So using his power of invisibility, he took the Sacred Fire away from Mayon Volcano, spreading darkness and chaos all over the world. Good thing Gugurang was able to take it back and punish Asuang. Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time ever, we will meet the God of Sins. None other than Asuang! [applauding] Welcome to the show. Come here, come here! Don't be shy, now. Hello! Asuang, I am very happy you could join us this afternoon. But I am just very curious, I just want to know. Asuang, how does it feel to be on the show today? -Because it is your first... -[laughs evilly] [both laughing evilly] Are you making fun of me? Of course not, sir. Sorry! Have you interviewed Fernando Poe, Jr. here? Yes, sir! -How about Dolphy? -Dolphy... Yes! -How about Ina Raymundo? -[Janet] Ina Raymundo. Uh... Let's proceed to our questions, Asuang. What can you say about your relationship with your brother Gugurang? Why must you mention that name? It's time you learn the truth about that god of yours! [spits] Here's how it goes... Ladies and gentlemen, also with us this afternoon, none other than the God of Good himself! Gugurang! -[applauding] -Welcome to the show! [chuckles] -Ah, you're looking good! -Hello! Yes, yes. Welcome to the show. Please, sit down! [Gugurang] Thank you, thank you, thank you! -Isn't this fun? -[Gugurang] Uh... -[clears throat] -[Janet chuckling] Are you really the God of Good? Or a god who steals the spotlight? [chuckles] [yells] Ouch, ouch, ouch, big brother! Let's get on with the show. Get on with the show. -[laughs] -Ouch, ouch, ouch. I'll get straight to the point. We all want to know, where is Bulan's moon? Is this an ambush? You brought me here to embarrass me in front of everyone? Then stay together, all of you! You fools who believe in this god! You are a good for nothing brother! You will never ever see me again! Oh, please, you can't even go invisible properly. -[Janet] That's right. -[Gugurang and Janet laughing] [screams] [both laughing] [Asuang] You find this too funny, huh? You will all pay for this. You will all pay for this! He turned himself into balls! -Quail eggs balls! -[both laughing] [eerie music playing] [eerie music intensifies] -[Jomar] Are we ready to start? -[Aica] Is everything set? -[Mike clears throat] -[Chelsea] Alright. [Asuang] It doesn't work. -[dog barking in distance] -It doesn't work. [grunts] -[whirring] -There we go. There. After we have blended the ingredients, it's now time to cut the chicken. Here, let me show you the chicken. There, right? Whoops, see? [laughs] Whoops, whoa! [laughs] It's still alive! Whoops! Do you want it hard or soft, sir? This should be lean. And keep the skin in place. -[dog barking in distance] -This is a bit tough. Ouch! [hisses] Uh, Director Ai-- Aico, can you switch on the stove for me? -[Aica] It's "Aica." -Right. Director Aica, can you? I don't know how to switch it on, you see. Do you know how? That's not really my... [chuckles] I'm no techie. -[stove knob clicks] -Whoa! You are good, director! Could you put the pot on the stove, too? [sniffles] Is that okay? There. Perfect. And then click the record button, too, please. -The nerve. -Never mind, I'll do it. Okay, we're all set! Now it's time to taste it. Okay, so let's try the ingredients. [groans, gags] Delicious! [coughs] Tune in again next week for another edition of Cooking with Asuang! Um, don't forget to like the video and subscribe! [retches, coughs] Whoo! -[water splashing] -Are you still rolling? I can still taste the... spices. Cooking Videos are popular right now, you see. Even Judy Ann has one. And there's this new guy, [stammers] Erwan, right? He's okay, but he's not that good. Nobody uses cookbooks anymore. Whoa. They just collect dust because everything's online now. But cooking videos like these are big hits. Because people can see how it's done step by step. [retches] [Aica] So how many videos have you done? Um, I've made about ten videos. My first one, I made Bicol Express. Then I've done the usual Filipino favorites like adobo and sour stew. [retching] Eventually, I'll try international cuisine too. Like caviar, uh, foie gras... And Asian dishes like bac pho... Uh, I'd reach a wider audience that way. Actually, I sent Chef Boy Logro a message. Chef Boy Logro, right? I said, "Chef, let's collaborate! "Let's do something... you know, fusion." I haven't heard from him yet. Tikboy! Could you-- Come here. -[gasps] -[clattering] -[rustling] -[playful music playing] The key to creating content is your branding. Other social media influencers focus on just one thing. Uh, just food, just travel. I'm not like that. I'm versatile. Just like a convenience store. I got it all for you. [Aica] What's your favorite content? [ukulele playing] I'm a-- Actually, I'm an avid fan of rapper Shanti Dope. Um, I think he's one of the best musicians in this generation. And I think, uh, he's the best. He's the best. For me, it's like-- I'm also a fan of Mozart, so it's like Mozart and then Shanti Dope. So like just three notches down. Uh, for this video, I will, um, cover his song, uh, "Mau." "Mau" as in Maureen. [plays ukulele] [inhales, exhales] # Come here # # Your smile is the reason # [rooster crowing] Hey, KitKat, he has a new post. He's eating roasted chicken. [chuckles] Come on, hurry. I want you to see what will happen to you if you piss me off. # My pet Yao Ming # # Will water Your grassy garden # [Asuang] You know, I read an article once. It said one of the most trending videos right now are the toy unboxing ones. So I buy toys that not many people know about and I unbox them and teach my viewers how to play with them. Just so the kids know how they work. See? Then I rate the toy in the video. If it's okay, I give it a thumb up. Just one thumb. # But why is that # -# Her nipple is so dark? # -Psst! Hey! I don't really give anything a thumbs down. Just to support the toy makers and those who came up with the idea. [Mike] There's a chicken in the frame, director. So? What do you want? [Asuang] Back in my day... I'm as old as time, you know. Uh, we didn't have such toys back then. So today's kids are so lucky to have these. [rooster crowing] You're so noisy! We're recording here. Ignore KitKat, she only wants attention. She has no followers, you see. Unlike me. The Asuang. -[Aica] Mike, roll the camera. -[Mike] Okay. [Aica] What's he up to? What is that? [Chelsea] I think he's stalking someone. [Mike] Wait. There. [Aica] See that? What is it? Who is that? [Jomar whispering] My eyesight is so bad. -[Aica] Are those abs? -[Chelsea] Why is he into abs? [Jomar gasps] He is watching... [Aica] Is he gay? [chuckling] -[Jomar] I don't know. -Oh. I didn't know you're here. Come on in! Come in, come in! [clears throat] Come over here. Hi, hello. -[Chelsea] Hello. -[chuckles] -Hello. Hi. -[Aica] Hi. Come in, come in. -Have you been here long? -[Aica] No, not really. -Just in time. -[hisses] -[screaming] -What's that? [Jomar whines] Why is there a snake here? [laughing] You son of a bitch, Jomar! Oh, that's just KitKat. Why are you even here? -[Jomar] Her name is KitKat? -Yes, KitKat. [Aica] He said her name is KitKat. [Jomar] So that's why the bitch has highlights on! [sighs] My bladder almost exploded. -[laughs] -[Asuang] Come on in! This guy's with you, right? Come in! [Aica] It's okay, Mike can stay there. [Jomar screaming] Is the snake angry? So this is KitKat. It really likes attention. [Jomar] That snake looks way better than me. Hi, I'm KitKat. [Aica] Why do you like Harry Prince? Harry Prince used to be so fat, you know. He was too fat. When he was a kid, he was so big, everybody laughed at him. One day he decided, "I'm not going to be fat anymore." So, he exercised a lot and lost weight. Then he would post his workout every day, how much effort and dedication he was putting into it. But I'm not gay. I'm just a fan. Gonna flex this! Watch this! Whoo! This is Juan Mig! He has a hype man right there, see? That's someone who supports and compliments him. So that's what I'm doing at my party tomorrow. I'm rebranding my image. [Asuang] Oh, my! That was fun! Uh. So, how's it going with this indie film so far? Uh, we're good. We got a lot of good footage today. -Really? Really. -Yeah. Here's a tip, director. Each shot should have a story. Bet you haven't heard of that one. Just like Harry Prince, right? When he traveled to Greece? He met Zeus and Poseidon, right? You mean at sea? That Poseidon? Are you guys sure you don't want to eat? You didn't eat the whole time you were here. -Let's eat before you go. -No, it's okay. We still have to edit today's footage. How about you, Chona? You really should eat something, Chona. It's Chelsea. Oh, it's Chelsea? I thought it was Chona. -[chuckles] -[chuckles sarcastically] So you're Chelsea, he's Jomar! Yeah, but can you call me Shomar instead. Just to soften it, because my face is so hard already. -[laughs] -Shomar sounds better. I see. Do you want to eat? Come on, guys, let's eat first. No, I have this thing with my partner. -We're going out on a date. -Oh, date. -Yeah. -[chuckles] I get it! Uh, maybe Mike wants something to eat. How about it, Mike? You've been holding that camera all day. [Mike] Next time, sir. I have a lot to do. -Yeah? -Maybe next time. Right. You're all busy. Yeah. Next time, Asuang, we promise. -That's a promise? -Yeah. If you guys need anything, let me know. If you want, I can help you with editing. I can edit! What do you use? Is it iMovie? -What do you think, director? -Yeah, we have to go. -Okay, thanks, guys! -See you next time! Wait, director. Can I talk to you for a bit? -Oh, sure. -We won't be long. Wait for me there. Uh, director, I just want to ask you if... you want to be my hype man. What-- what do you mean? This film you're making... it's going to restore my good name, right? -The New Asuang. -Right. -Right! You get it! You get me! -Right! Fist bump! -There. Whoosh. -Whoosh. Okay, okay! Director, I can't thank you enough! -Thank you too! -You're the best! You're the best! Thanks again! -Yeah! -Thanks, guys! Take care! Bye! What did he say? -That I'm his hype man. -[Jomar] What? [sniffs] Hype man, my ass! [rumbling] [screams] There it goes again. -Not another earthquake. -It seems stronger this time. Is it over? Mike, Mike. There's a cockroach on your shoulder. -[Mike] Where? -[Aica] Wait, wait! Come on! -[grunts] -[Chelsea] Hey! Gosh, It's just a cockroach. Come on, let's eat. Let's go, guys! [Jomar] I could eat that cockroach. [Bert] Hey, guys! How was the shoot? -[Jomar] Hi, babe. -Hi, babe. -Hey, man. -[Chelsea] Hi, Bert. I'm sorry, I had a prior commitment. Prior, really. -[Chelsea] Okay. -You could've... Fine, okay. -Bye, Mike. -[Bert] Let me do that, bro. Mm. Yeah, take over. [Jomar] Sit beside me, babe. [Bert] Slow down, director. They're beer nuts, not rice. I'll turn you into a beer nut. Mind the camera memory. Turn it off! Look at these stupid folks, stepping on lava. If I pour Mayon Volcano's lava on these people... [laughs] ...it'll burn their nuts off. [both laughing] -What a waste! -[Jomar] Mm-hmm. -[Bert] Director. Aica. -What? [Bert] Tell me again why we're doing this? Is this some trip you're on? I just think that once and for all, Asuang must be exposed, you know. People deserve to know who he really is. I mean, just like what we do in our other documentaries. But I think... Asuang has changed. -[Bert] I think so, too. -[Chelsea] Seems like it. No, my point is... He's already deceived and manipulated you guys, along with many other people. But if you look closely, you can see right through him. [Bert] So what happens after you expose Asuang? [scoffs] Why are you even on my team, Bert? [chuckles] You're only after the awards, you see. Don't you want a sense of... -Full... Full, push, pull... -[Aica] What? -[chuckles] Fulfillment! -Exactly! Sorry, my tongue itches from the peanuts. -Sense of fulfillment! -[Bert] Ma'am, I want two orders of laing with principles, two orders of conscience... and a glass of speed too. Thank you! [Jomar] Ma'am, do you have... [woman] Wait, I'm getting the laing! Hey, we said it's for dine-in, not to go. [laughs] Gosh, you're fat but you got no brain. [Asuang] Come in, guys! -[Aica] Hi. Morning. -Hi. Good morning! Do you want breakfast? I made pancakes. Ah, no, thanks, we're good. -Are you sure? Okay. -It's okay. Yeah. -Hey, put the buffet table... -Roll it, Jomar. ...in the center so the guests see it as they come. Are you-- Are you getting this? Did you feel the earthquake last night? That was strong. Yeah, and it's happening more often. Yes, because Mayon Volcano is erupting anytime now. So get ready, there'll be lots of death. So are you sure you don't want pancakes? -They're good. -[Aica] Are you serious? Of course, they're good. I made them myself. -Two thumbs up. -[Aica] No, no, no. I mean... about Mayon erupting soon. [chuckles] Oh, yeah, seriously. Come on. You mortals probably delayed it by offering gifts to my big brother, but I don't think it would still work this time. You made him so angry. But don't worry. I think he's only going to kill the bad people. -[Jomar sighing] -But I'm not sure! [chuckles] What the fuck? -[Asuang] Uh, guys! -[Aica] Just a second. Uh... [coughs] So how's the foods coming along? [chuckles] It's just fine. Four more dishes to go. We're making the dessert later. -There. She's Nilda, my friend. -[giggles] Come on, Asuang, it's embarrassing. I'm so disheveled. You're always disheveled. [laughs] -Oh, you! [laughs] -Now that Nilda has retired, uh, she's now just a regular housewife. That's it. She cooks... There she goes. Make sure that's delicious, Nilda! Of course! [chuckles] Nilda is a great cook! Hey! What's the matter with you? Don't throw it away, wash it! There's more over here. [Asuang] The food has to be special because we have a lot of important guests coming. [Nilda] I don't think we have enough. [girl] Are we done? [Nilda] Of course, we're not done! We have four dishes to go! Hurry up! Move back some more. Your belly is in the way. There. See? ATM. I'm posting this later. [groans] This is all burnt. No, it's not. It smells just like your armpits. -I'm going to the bathroom. -Go ahead. I'll get this done. Hey, where is the chicken? -[faint music playing] -Hey, KitKat! Give us a wave! [chuckles] What a snob. KitKat is a longtime friend. Uh, she's an aswang. Uh, I'm sure you see her around. Uh, the other day she was a wild boar. Sometimes she's a goat. It depends on her mood. But let me clear this up. We're not related. I'm not related to aswangs. Our names just sound the same. It's like "vlog" and "blog". Their aswang is spelled with a W. Mine is with a U. Uh, sometimes I live with aswangs. And... that's how I learned that their culture is really misunderstood. The movies showed different images of them, so people don't look at them in a positive way. My brother don't like them too, because they eat people. So a lot of them died and some are in hiding. [Aica] Chelsea! Chelsea! Move away! Ew! -What are you doing? -[Aica] There's a cockroach. -Don't! -[Aica] Why not? -It's not doing anything to you. -[Aica] But it's flying. When it lands on you, you can decide what to do. Can you move back? [chuckles] You're too close. Oh, boss? What is it? It's the roast chickens you ordered. -What's that? -The roast chickens? -All those? -[man] Yes, sir. There's more downstairs, you got freebies. [chuckles] Okay. Uh... No, it's okay. Uh, KitKat? KitKat? -KitKat. -What is it? -You ordered roast chickens? -You said to order lechon. Uh, can we cut first? -Sure. -We're done, right? Let's take a break, okay? Uh, everyone relax. You want a drink, director? Have some drinks first. Come here. When I told you to buy lechon, I meant pork. A roasted pig. Why did you buy roast chicken? But you didn't say what kind to get. When I say lechon, it means roasted pig. Why did you buy roast chicken? And 20,000 pesos worth? But that's still lechon. That's not fit for a feast. You buy that when you don't have food at home. Okay, maybe even for a graduation party. But this is my party! Harry Prince is coming, and you'll serve him roast chicken? -I can't send it back. -Shh! Shh. Stop explaining. Get in there, make it look like a roast pig, I don't care how you do it. Just do it, or I'll roast you. Hmm? All right, go on. -Oh, she'll show you the way. -Okay. Okay? Thank you! Thank you, sir. That's a lot of chicken! [chuckles] [sighs] Sometimes it's, uh... [chuckles] it's really difficult to delegate responsibilities. You know, you have all these things going on. You're busy. [tongue clicks] Well, you have no choice. You have to let other people do these things. Sometimes, you give the simplest instructions, and they just don't get it. You know what I'm saying? [tongue clicks] It makes you wanna... [chuckles] [laughs] -[Kapitana] Asuang! -I love exotic... Who's that? Oh, the barangay captain! Just a sec, director. Uh, Kapitana. Good afternoon! How are you? It's nice to see you. What brings you here? You don't have a permit. What? What sort of permit? You had the street cordoned off. The police cars can't pass through. Uh, so my guests can have parking later. -I see. -Yes, yes. And what's all this? Uh, they're shooting an indie film. It's about me. They couldn't think of a better subject. [both chuckle] You still don't have a permit. Oh, you. She's so funny! Have you seen my hibiscus plants downstairs? I have a lot of new plants. You love plants, don't you? -I didn't notice. -Well, let me show you, then! -You have new plants? -Yes, I've just bought them. [mouths] Let's cut filming. -[Kapitana] I do smell Jasmines. -I know, right? -You grow them, right? -Oh, yes! -And you sell them? -Not anymore, I lost money. Hang on. [grunts] Here you go. Uh... I'm sorry about all this, Kapitana. This is all last minute, you see. [chuckles] -I'm really sorry. -Oh, sure, sure. -I forgot to tell you. -Nothing to worry about. But this is just for tonight, okay? -One night? -Yes, yes. And remove the cordons when you are done, okay? -Of course! -They can't get through. -You know how it is. -Of course, my apologies. Oh, wait. Uh, KitKat? -KitKat! -[KitKat] What? Give ten bags of your roast chicken to Kapitana! -[KitKat] Here you go. -No, this is too much! -[Asuang] Oh, no, just take it! -No need for that. Don't be shy. There you go. [Kapitana] Grab them, boys, quickly! And if you need anything else, just send word. -Thank you, Kapitana! -Okay, enjoy your party! -Yes, we will! -We'll be outside. Just call me if you need anything more. -No, I'm fine. Bye! -All right. -[Kapitana] Thank you. -Close the gate behind you! [Kapitana] I'll take care of it. Okay. Whoo. [chuckles] KitKat. Send 20 more bags of roast chicken to Kapitana. Okay. Oh... Is the camera rolling? Wait, I'm just putting on my black contact lenses. Okay, it's straight. Now the other eye. -All good. -Okay, get out. See? It looks natural, right? Excuse me, there's just something I have to do. -Can one of us go with you? -No. [Chelsea] It doesn't look so good, director. [Aica] It's okay. That's still raw material. Come on. KitKat? Keep me out of your indie stuff. [Aica] Roll it. Uh, hello, uh... Is this Harry Prince's publicist? Uh, I just want to ask if he got Asuang's invitation? Uh, yes. [mic feedbacks] Uh... [Jomar] Follow her, follow her. Asuang is expecting him, you see. He is the guest of honor. Is that so? All right then. You don't want to annoy me. [snarls, hisses] What are you doing? [growls] Stop it! That's the trouble with Asuang. He's so impulsive. He'd get an idea and I'd go crazy putting this instant party together. [Aica] Why are you doing it? Why do you care? [phone ringing, beeps] Hello? Sun God? Uh... Did you get the invitation to Asuang's party? Ye-- Hello? Hell-- Hello? [man] Mic check. -Check sound. -[mic feedbacks] -[Aica] Are you getting paid? -No. [Aica] So you're not getting anything out of this? I am. Meat. God meat. [Aica] What's that for? [sighs] It's supposed to taste really good. Hello? Hello? Where are you? Is that so? All right then. Gosh. [Aica] What's it for, that god meat you mentioned? [sniffs] Uh... Your meat... [chuckles, sniffs] ...smells good. Uh, can you repeat the question? Uh... You were talking about god meat? -To-- -[growls, whispers] I'll answer your question, but... [sniffs] I'll chew on your arm first. -Is that all right? -No, stay here. There, right in front of the camera. -[man] Check. Check. Sound. -Right there. [clucks] Here. Right here. Stand back a bit, okay? You know about Mayon Volcano's eruption, right? Yes. Why? You're scared, aren't you? But when your kind were killing off aswangs like me, you felt absolutely nothing, right? [phone ringing] Hello? You're annoying, you know. Go away now. [man] Check, sound check, sound check. Check. [mic feedbacks] Mic check. Sound check. -[clattering] -[KitKat snarling, hissing] [grunts, snarls] # Here's Asuang # # The brother of Gugurang # # Here's Asuang # # The brother of Gugurang # # Here's Asuang # # The brother of Gugurang # # Here's Asuang # # The brother of Gugurang # # Really, really # # Really, really # # Really, really # # Really, really # Hey, hey. Do it right. Oh. [chuckles] # Really, really # # They're so happy Aren't they? # # Really, really # One, two, three, four, five. # They're so happy Aren't they? # # Really, really # [snarls] -[Chelsea] Are we all set, Aica? -[chuckles] [mic feedbacks] "He was the ruler of everything evil. "The king of mischief and deception and bad. "The-- The destroyer of peace. "But he is not that anymore. "Asuang is gone. "But the death of a great god "is the birth of an even greater god. [chuckles] "Let's give a hand to the forever god of social media! -[drum roll] -"None other than Ash-ang!" -[crowd applauding] -[upbeat music playing] [cheering, applauding] I'd like to thank everyone... Can we dim the light a bit? It's too strong. That's how it should be when you're onstage. -[Asuang] What? Really? -Yes. [KitKat] It makes your skin look lighter on camera. Turn it down a little. Who's handling the spotlight? [man] It's Dindo, sir. -Dindo! [grunts] -[upbeat music stops] There. [groans] I couldn't see anything. [chuckles] Uh, first of all, I would like to thank... [dramatic music playing] [Asuang] Psst! Hey! Who are you people? KitKat? Come here. Come over here. What happened? Where is everyone? Where are my guests? They're not coming. And you didn't tell me to tell you if something like this happens. Right? [hisses, groans] Get out! But why? I thought we were going to help each other? Damn it, KitKat, just leave. [moody percussion music playing] [Asuang] They're late, that's all. Well, of course, we're in Albay, right? The flights were delayed. Yeah, that's it. [chuckles] The flights are delayed. That's normal. You know, they want to be fashionably late. [chuckles] Um, I'll just repeat the program later. Then, Director Aica, you can introduce me. [Aica] Ah, okay... [utensil clinking] -[Mike] Cockroach! -Hey! [Mike] It's a miracle! You didn't step on it. [rumbling] [Jomar screaming] What the hell was that? [clinking] Did it erupt? [sniffs] [Aica] No. Not yet, I think. Will you get up, Jomar? What time is it? -[Aica] Uh, 4:38 in the morning. -Right. [tongue clicks] Damn my brother. The jerk's grabbing the spotlight again. He does this all the time! -[thumps] -He always does, damn him. That Gugurang? That jerk Gugurang? He's always been that way. He always wanted to be the star. He's got the fire, he's got the scepter. He's got the fans. While me, his brother, only wants a simple party... He wouldn't even give me that. The guests wouldn't come. How could they? How could they when they think that this damn volcano could erupt any time? You, take this, and this! And this, too! Just erupt already, damn you! I don't care. We can all die! -Jerk! -[door slams] Damn you, volcano. You know what? Just leave. All of you, just get out. [door closes] -[dramatic music playing] -[Asuang] Get out! Stop shooting already. You won't get anything out of it. Asuang? Asuang? [knocks] Talk to us, please. [knocks] Chelsea. Give me a pen and paper. Asuang, you're better than this. Why are you giving up so soon? [mouths] Don't do it. Just go, please. Let's talk, please. We're friends, right? [knocks] Jomar, roll sound. You're going in with me. I'm out. You take care of that shit. [Aica] We're coming in. [moody music playing] Are you okay? What is this? Poison? [bottles clinking] Does poison work on gods like you? [Asuang clears throat] Give me that. Ouch. That's steep. You're so nosey. Here. No, thanks. Um... I don't drink. Not really. -[bottles clinking] -Why? I mean, yeah, I drink, but nothing that strong. Okay, fine. -Finish it. -Really? [Asuang] You don't want to? Then get out. Get out of here. Here goes. [Asuang chuckling] Are you okay? [Asuang chuckling] I see you're tough, Aica! -Drink up, everyone! -Cheers! -Let's drink! Cheers! -Cheers! Come to think of it. All gods have weapons. -Mm-hmm. -All gods except me. What is my power? -To make myself invisible. -Which is cool. Cool? Because I can go into the ladies' toilet? -[chuckles] -Damn it. Think about it! I committed just one sin. Just one. All right, let's say two. And that makes me evil? Damn it, can't I do good deeds? No, Aica, you got it wrong. You're just like my brother. No, actually, you and I are alike. I hate my sister. Sometimes... Sometimes, okay? You see, -she'd always... dominate me. -Dominate. That's it! [chuckles] I think she's doing those things because she thinks she knows what's good for me. Damn you, brother. Damn you, Gugurang. If he doesn't like you, -he'd burn you alive. -Mm-hmm. He doesn't care if you're a god, too. This isn't ever going to heal. -I want to be powerful too. -Mm-hmm. You know what I'm saying? -Mm-hmm. -And... I want the people to love me too, to make monuments of me. You know what I mean? People would take selfies in front of my monument and post them on Instagram, and... I want them to respect me, too, you know. -[rumbling] -[screaming] Ouch! Ouch! [groans] -Earthquake again? -[groaning] That sobered me up. [Aica] This shaking is happening often. [breathes heavily] I told you, Mayon is about to erupt. -[Aica] For real? -[groans] -[chuckles, laughs] -[Aica] Psst. Hey. I got it! [laughs] I know the perfect content-- Hey, director! You will cover this hero content I'm creating. Just give me the raw files so I can upload to social media. But think about it, it's going to be your story. "Ash-ang saves the world "from his grumpy big brother!" This is so good! -Too risky. -Risky? [chuckles] Sure it is, but... you've done risky projects before, haven't you? That one in Mindanao. That documentary about the rallyists in Manila that were beaten up by the police. And the extrajudicial killings in Pasig. Hold it right there. Are you doing this to clean up your image? You know, I like you better when you don't talk. [scoffs] Well, then, I'm out. Let's go, guys. Let's pack up, hurry. If you don't create my content... I wouldn't save mankind. You will all die. [scoffs] Is that so? He's gone crazy. He's lost it. Asuang's gone insane. Let's go, guys. Come on, let's pack up. Director? -How much time do we have? -Time. Me, I've got lots of time. The earthquakes are coming more frequently, right? Let's say two to three days, tops. Don't listen to him. Asuang is lying. Mortal! I steal. I do evil deeds. But a god never lies. [Jomar] Come on, director. Why do you want us to cover this? Because, Director Aica... Because I want you to! What's the problem? Don't you want to do this? Director, you're my hype man, remember? All right, have it your way. The lives of billions are in your hands, that's all. Don't believe him. Fine. If you really want my help, I'll go with you. -But leave my team out of it. -[Chelsea] Director... It's okay, Chelsea. This is the fulfillment we're looking for, anyway. -Right, Jomar? -[tongue clicks] But... [Chelsea] Fine, fine, fine. But if something goes wrong, -we turn back right away. -Yeah, sure. -We'll go home. Promise. -Promise? I'm excited to try that laing with principles. That sounds good, Bert! Oh, here, let's go live! Live video, there! Hi, guys! Yes, I'm with my crew. There's Director Aica, there's Chona, there's Shomar. And we're going to eat some special laing, and you can't sit with us. Because we're gonna save the world through the fire. # Through the fire # # Through the fire Through the fire # -Oh, sorry. -Turn it off for now. -Am I too loud? Sorry. -No. Why then? Be careful about posting such things. We don't want to be found out. What do you mean? They won't... The gods won't find out, they have all blocked me. They are snobs. Don't worry about it. They might see it on someone else's profile. -Right. -They don't know that. They don't know anything about that stuff. -So stubborn. -Tell him to stop posting. -I'll take care of it. -What an attention seeker. Guys, the food's here! -[Aica] Put that away. -There you go. Put that aside. Let's eat first. -[Chelsea] Oh. -[utensil clinking] [Asuang] Come on, eat! -Here we go. -[chuckles] I'll go ahead. This is really good. Albay makes the best laing! [Bert] Be careful, sir. Don't share your food with Jomar. His profundity might rub off on you. Get over it, will you? -What was that? I don't get it. -I'll have some of this. It's nothing. Never mind. This is what I'll do in my next cooking video. I bet I'll get a lot of views and likes. -Probably. -I really like-- -Good evening, Asuang. -[gasps] Adelaida. What are you doing here? Can I talk to you alone? [Asuang] No, you can't. If you want to speak to me, -[chair scraping] -you may do so in front of them. -On camera? -[Asuang] Yeah, tell them. No one must hear. No one would because there's no one else here! Very well. [indistinct whispering] We know that you know all about the prophecy. That Gugurang will destroy the world. And we know of your plan. What plan are you talking about? I don't have... I don't have a plan! All your posts are public, you know. Why? Isn't that allowed too? Is posting not allowed by your god? It's called freedom of speech, you know. We want to help you. I know what this is. This is an ambush, right? Where is Gugurang? Is he out there? Gugurang! We know you plan to steal the fire. I think you're suffering from dementia, Adelaida. You come up with such crazy ideas. Are you an idiot? "Through The Fire?" It's my favorite song. Do you have a problem with black artists? Fool! It's all over your Facebook page! You post everything, even taking a crap. Hey! People are eating. Besides, I never said anything about our mission. Gotcha! So there is a mission! -I knew it. I knew it. -[Adelaida scoffs] But you can't do it alone. Mayon Volcano is heavily guarded. And they can smell your evil scent even if you're invisible. You need a cover. Creatures who can match your evil ways. [scoffs] No thanks. My film crew will get the job done. They're sinners, too, anyway. I'll just count their sins. If we need more, then we'll do more. You need people with real skills. So this is your crew? What would they do? Record you while the God of Storms hurls lightning rods at you? Could you not scare them? All right, fine. I'll just call my old gang. They're cunning. They're all sinners. Uh, I will just hold an audition. I would suggest that you include the most famous thief in the world today. [tongue clicks] Sure, sure. You know what, Adelaida? Do what you want to do, but thanks for your help. I'll decide on who I want to take along on my mission. [chair legs scraping] Thank you, Asuang. You should have thanked me a long time ago, Adelaida. After all the bashing I endured from you, and all the... Where'd she go? [rock music playing] How about this one? That Tom is a drug lord and an addict. Crap, he's busy. Damn you, Tom, you got no balls. Let's find someone else. [hisses] What's this one's name? I'm Ashley Tiffany Bianca Anderson. What are your skills? Well, I can sing, I can dance. I don't know, I can be flexible. Whatever you need, I will do it, legit. The worst thing you've ever done in your life. I didn't return my mother's change. Do you know who I am? Not really, sir. Sorry. I'm a god. -Don't I look familiar? -[man] God... Sir, the only god I know is Gugurang. Oh, my god, Gugurang! Shit! I worship you with my fam everyday. I idolize him. Before an exam, I pray to him... Bro, bro, bro! Uh, we'll just text you. -Really? -Yes. And call in the next one, will you? -KitKat? -What? I'm not KitKat. I'm a male criminal. -KitKat, what are you doing? -I wanna come! You're messing up my auditions! Go away! But you promised me the meat of the gods. You want meat? Here, start with this. -[growls] -Chew on that! Damn. You know, it's easy to find sinners. But a sinner with balls? Damn. Hard to find! Not like Aica here. Right? She's cool. Okay, next! Hmm. Please tell me your na-- Asuang! [giggles] I thought you joined the priesthood? I did. Why should I hire you? Because I want to save the world, Asuang! I want to help people. -Mm-hmm. -[scoffs] I want Filipinos to change! Get rid of all criminals! I want to help with global warming. -Mmm... -And with Dengvaxia. Spell Dengvaxia. I want to eliminate dengue! Ekis, I want to know the real reason. I want my life to have meaning, Asuang! The truth. I want... I want to make money. That too. You said... in your message something about a million. Is that still a go? Yes, it is. So there. And the mission. I am a priest after all. And I'm not busy right now. What's even better, I brought my brother with me. [tongue clicks] Big brother, what kind of trip is this? This, my brother, is a miracle. I'm sorry for not visiting you lately. I've been too busy serving the god Gugurang. Hey, hey, hey, baby shark! -What's your name, sweetheart? -[chuckles] Don't look at me like that, my gosh. Are you a cage? Because I want to lock my... -Back off! Damn it. -[chuckles] How are you, Ompong? -Asuang? -Yes. What are you doing with Asuang? What are you up to? [Ekis] Let me explain. Damn, is this some kind of networking? Hold on. He's taking us on a mission where our holiness will match Gugurang's! We need your help. -[chuckles] Guys, guys, guys. -That's it. [scoffs] I have retired. I no longer go for such trouble. Not anymore. I pass. Look at me! I'm an action star now! -You're an action star now? -Yes! -Like FPJ? -[laughs] Yes, exactly! People are starting to notice my moves. -Show me. -Like this! [grunting, laughs] -[cell phone ringing] -Someone's calling. What? [Asuang] Is that your cell phone? Damn it. Hello? What is it? [woman on phone] Damn it, Ompong, where's the tweezers? Damn it, I'm in an audition! [woman] Oh, is that so? Go home now! Just look for it! It's right beside the Hello Kitty mug! Damn it. What a pest! Guys, what exactly is this job? Can you... let me join you? Big brother? [laughs] Okay, guys, here's the catch. No one can touch the Sacred Fire. Only Gugurang can. Well, even he has to endure it. -Interesting, huh? -How? Ask me how. This is where I put the Sacred Fire. This is what I used to steal it. This time... Oh, yeah. I, Ash-ang... Ash-ang will emerge victorious! Yeah, I can feel it. Let's go, guys. Come on! Uh, Bert, can you do... video montage? Just shoot from different angles, then we'll drop some nice music during the edit. Something organic, right? Keep the vibe light. Can you see this, Mike? Now, here's the problem. Mayon Volcano is going to erupt any time now. It really is, okay. Now, this is where we go. There's a lot of high, coarse grass there. But don't worry. I'll take care of it. I know the way. [Bert] So, this is the way. [Asuang] Are you okay there, Bert? [Asuang] Are we all set, Chona? [Chelsea] We're all set. This is the sin meter. I stole it from Sitan. He's the Tagalog counterpart of the God of the Underworld. He uses this to tell him if someone goes up to heaven or down to hell. It's not on the level, though. Commit a sin for me, Ompong. [Ompong] Is it a sin to love? I heart you. Here's a sin. Here you go. -Is it level now? -Sweet! Gugurang has killed almost every criminal in the world. It's going to be tough to find sin anywhere! My lord Gugurang, I do not condone the sins of my brother. Forgive my ears for hearing his words! [Ompong] It's your fault! Will you kill someone already to get the meter right? Stop that, Ekis! Do it right. Who are you? My name is Miguel. I was sent by Adelaida. I know this guy. It is him! He's the one who stole the gods' bracelets! Hey, director! The meter's level now! I'm happy with this team. It's a good team. We have a good bond. I'm not sure about Miguel, though. I know his clan. We have a history, but I won't share that with you. You know, being a good thief runs in the blood. Listen up, guys! The mission is simple. We will go up Mayon Volcano and search for the passageway that leads to Gugurang's home. The only challenge is Gugurang's hired men. Remember that area with the huge boulder? It's hard to forget. There are crows there. Huge crows. Really black crows. Now these crows can smell an approaching evil entity. [mimicking crow] The only way to distract them is for us to bring a lot of maggots. We will scatter the maggots around and the crows will get distracted by eating them. Then they won't smell me. Then we can pass. You wanna see the whole thing? You can see, right? Here, look. To get a better look. So you'll remember better. This is our map. Do you understand? Who knows karate? I've known Ekis since he was a kid. His loud mouth always got us in trouble with the police. Go on, show them your moves! How? But Ekis is really talented. I have no idea how he ended up that way. Must be something he ate. [Aica] So, how do you feel? Uh, right now? I'm excited, of course. But... a bit nervous, you know. Because this is it, right? In the words of the great Harry Prince on his Instagram-- Is it true that you've been scared of fire ever since Gugurang punished you? Me, scared? Of fire? [scoffs] Hey! [groans] -Don't you dare! -Okay. Okay. They're nothing but trolls. Don't listen to them. Let's play some music! ["Mau" by Shanti Dope playing] # It'll make you say "Fuck shit" # Is there another song we can listen to? Stupid, it's Shanti Dope! It's the best music in the world! # Like she sunbathed On the roof at noon # # Or she took after The color of tires # # She's smooth and fair But why is that # # Her nipples are as black As coal, coal, coal? # # Come here # Off to Mayon, guys! Off to Mayon! Team Ash-ang! Team Ash-ang! Team Ash-ang! Hold, guys, hold! # Every time I sleep # # I want your dirty smell # # Maureen Give me your attention # Baby! Babycakes! Baby Shark! Aica! Come on, big brother. [Ekis screams] # Hold on to me # [Aica] Stay away from me. # It'll make you say # Okay, guys, let's go! Let's go! Hello! # But why is that # # Her nipples are as black As coal? # KitKat thought I wouldn't recognize her. There she is! Just hanging around. Go home! # She's smooth and fair # [Aica laughing] -Flowers for you! -[jeering] # Really, really # # Really, really # # Really, really # # I still want you even more # # Really, really # # Really, really # [song fading] # Really, really # Hero... content. Move it, man. You're too slow. -Okay. Uh... -Right here. Guys. [clears throat] You okay? Bert? Uh, Miguel, move a little. You don't want to move? I just want to let you all know that I can really feel it now. That I'm finally going to be a social media god! I can feel it. So this is my time. [groans] [shouts] Invisible time! [Ekis] What's Asuang up to? -What? -[Aica] We can see your head. Really? Where am I facing? -Now? -Here. -Point to my head if you see it. -There. -Now, where is it? -There. -[Asuang] You can still see it? -Yes, we can. Okay, I'll work on it later. Here's the plan. If anyone asks you, tell them you're hiking and you're documenting the area. -[crows cawing in distance] -[shushes] The guards are coming! They're here! The maggots! Where are the maggots? -Where are they? -The maggots. [Asuang] How did the crows get here? They should be at the foot of the mountain. I already gave them to Ekis earlier! I stopped eating maggots a long time ago! -I don't have them. -They're not in my pockets! So, where are the maggots? I have them. I have the maggots. You got them? Give them to me! Why didn't you say so? My Lord Gugurang! -It looks like fish food. -[rustling] -Oh, my, they're here! -[crows cawing] -[Ekis] It's the god Okot! -[shouts] Kneel! Kneel! How dare you not kneel before a god! Unbelievable! Back in the day, all it took was one look and everyone would be on their knees! What is that? Turn that thing off! Uh, we're just shooting a documentary. [Okot] I think I smell something rotten. [sniffing] -I know you. -My god-- [stammers] Who are you again? I am a mere shepherd serving our god Gugurang. -Shut that thing off! -We need to record all... I know you, too. [stammers] Maybe you've seen me on TV, Mr. God. I'm an action star, you see. -[stammers] Uh, what show? -Uh, it's... Terror of Albay. [chuckles] Oh, I watch that! The one with Coco Martin! -[chuckles] -I'm actually just a stuntman. But I'm going to have my own show soon. -You're a stuntman? [chuckles] -[Ompong] Yes. Then show me a tumble! Sample! Sample! It's too rocky, sir. But I can do this! [grunting] Yes, I may not know you. But if you're in this wanted list, then I have to let Boss know right away. But for now, I'll keep you here with me. [chuckles] Uh, Lord Okot, can we talk about this in a more civilized manner? Didn't you hear the crows cawing earlier? That means one thing. Asuang is among you. He's with you, isn't he? Lord Okot, I am a shepherd and servant of lord Gugurang! I spread his word amongst men! [Asuang groaning] Who is that? [sneezes] It's me. [sniffs] I get a rhinitis attack in the morning. Do you take me for a fool, mortal? -Who is that? -[Aica] I said it's me. [cell phone vibrating] Ompong, I think you dropped this earlier. [stammers] How did you get my phone? [Miguel] That's brand new, isn't it? It's nice! -Yes, dude, it's the P20 Pro. -[Miguel] Wow. -Leica lens. -[Okot] That looks good! It's so good, when you take a selfie, -your soul shows in the picture! -[Okot] Nice! Who's this? -Who's that? -It's nobody, just my wife. But look how clear this is, Mr. God. Beautiful. "Huawei P20 Pro." [Miguel] Maybe now you'll let us through to Mayon? [Okot chuckles] No can do. We cannot break Gugurang's laws! Hey, stop it with the video! I might go viral! [chuckles] I don't know how I can help you but hand that over. -Give that to me. -[Ompong] This is expensive. [Ekis] We'll get you a new one. [Okot] Careful, we don't want Gugurang to see. No thanks, that one's ugly. [giggles] [Ompong] Brother, he took my phone! [Ekis] It's okay. -[Ompong] That's my wife's. -What? -[Ekis] We'll get a new one! -[Ompong] But it's mine! And we'll get you a new one! Seriously, Ompong. -[Ompong] But that's mine! -[Ekis] It's just a cell phone! You're acting like a kid! Don't be a brat, Ompong! That'll put us in trouble. [Ompong yelling] Asuang! This wasn't part of the deal! -Come on! -[Okot] Asuang? [Ompong] Damn that-- -[Ompong] He took my phone! -[Ekis] Hey! [chuckles] Well, look who's here! [chuckles] Welcome back to Mayon, Asuang! -Hold my glass. -[Jomar] Glasses. -[Okot] Ready for me, Asuang? -[drum playing] I'll take care of this. Keep rolling. [Okot] I've been waiting for this moment for a long time, Asuang! [chuckles] So long, I see you got pregnant! Damn you, you son of a whore, you crazy-ass monster! That's too personal! -Come on! -[ominous drum music playing] Let's get it on! [screams] [both grunting] -[screaming] -[Aica] Jomar! [Bert] Help him! -[Asuang] Hey, hey, Jomar! -[grunting] [Jomar groans] -[Ekis] Hey! -[Aica] Someone help them! -Give me back my phone! -Hey! [Ompong] Ekis, help me, brother! -[Ekis] Hey, that's my brother! -[groans] [Ompong] Help him! That's what we get for trying to fight a god! -[grunts] -Ouch! -What? -[Okot] Game? -Ready? -Hurry! [both screaming] -[grunts] -[groans] -[yelling] -[groaning] Tie him down tightly! Alright. You'll pay for this, Asuang! [groans] Are you the one they call the brave one? This is Gugurang's general? My ass! [spits] [grunts] [Miguel] It's Okot's weapon. It's warm. -Leave it. -Wait. But we can use this when we fight Gugurang! Our mission is to steal. Not to fight a god. Leave it there. -[dramatic music playing] -[Bert sobbing] Babe, you can keep my share of the money. Your shoes... the Jordans are under the bed. [sobs] Asuang, make sure my babe comes out of this alive. [sobs] [Bert] Joms, don't close your eyes. Don't sleep. [sobs] You idiot. I'm dying. [Bert] No, please. [Bert sniffling] -Damn you! -[groans] -Okay? -Baby? Ouch. Baby. [Ompong groaning] [Ekis] Can you do this right for once? [Ompong] Big brother... Thank you. Come on, let's go! [Ekis] Wow, damn it! Shit! Damn! -[Ekis groaning] -Move quickly! -You're overacting, Ekis! -[groans] [groans] Damn. Where did the director go? -[Ekis groaning] -Chelsea, come on! Lord Gugurang, we ask you to cleanse the soul of our friend Jomar and grant our request for his eternal repose. Sitan's men are coming and they might see us. They're going to report to my brother. Let's go. Damn you, Gugu--! Oh, sorry. [grunts] This outfit is such a waste! Come on, Chelsea! What's taking Ekis so long? Director, let's go. I don't want to die here. [Bert] She's right. You promised, didn't you? You said if something goes wrong, we will turn back! Even I don't want to go further, really. But if we don't film this, Asuang won't... [Bert] They can do this without us. If not, I'd rather die with my family. Hey, come on! We don't need the money or this movie! [sighs] It's not about that anymore. I want to... I want to help. Not for Asuang but for... But I get you. If you want to leave, then go. I told you I would do this alone. [Bert] You know we're going to follow you wherever you go. [tongue clicks] Then don't. [Bert] Come on. All right, then. We're sorry. Jomar is right. This is our self-fulfillment. All right, we're safe. Safe? Jomar's dead and that's safe? Safe? If you want to stay, then stay. But me... I'm leaving. I'm out of here. [Bert] Hey. Hey, Chona, where are you going? This is the right way! -Director? -[Aica] She's going home. -What? -She's going home. Let her be. It's a wrap for her? Okay, then. Let's go. Come on, Ekis! You're taking so long! Where the hell are those two? Damn this! They should have gone down the mountain. For the record, if we don't do this before the volcano erupts, it's Ekis' fault! -Damn carabao! Whoo! -Watch your mouth, brother! Gugurang will get mad! Shut up or I'll make your mouth bleed! -Damn jerk. -We don't have time. -Let's go! -Five more minutes. You should have gone back down with Chelsea. It's easier to go down than to climb up! -[coughs] -You hear? You should have gone down and go to the hospital. Why do you want me to leave? Do you think this is easy? I can see my bone marrow, you jerk! You're turning pale, you should go to the hospital. Why are you rushing me? If you want to go ahead, then go, you monster! Go ahead. Gugurang won't wait for you. The volcano will explode any time now. It won't wait for you, fool. Come on, Let's go! Let's go. Wait a second. Where did you get the enchanted hemp cord? You mean this? I've stolen from so many, I can't remember who I stole this from. Dimalacap. Yes, I remember. I know you, and your grandfather... and your grandfather's grandfather. I know. You put him under your spell, didn't you? You used your hands to make him do evil acts. To help you steal Bulan's moon. Am I right? You're right. [scoffs] There you go. And why did you want to steal the moon again? Oh, yes, to shield your ugly face! Hey, kid, watch what you're saying. Stop it! You're the reason why everyone looks down on my family! Whoa, hold on. It's not my fault that your family never changed its ways. Only one of you was under my spell. Did I make you do anything? Did I tell you to steal? Damn you, Asuang. [groans] Damn you. I'm going to kill him when I'm back on my feet. What if we poison him? Bert, hold on to this for me. [Aica] Can this Falls of Light really heal? [Asuang] No, it's a lie. That's all my brother's piss. Asuang, I know a shortcut to Gugurang's home. It's safer and faster. What shortcut is he talking about? -There is no shortcut, kid. -Yes, there is, stupid. When we pass the Brook of Light, we'll see the passageway. Um, correction. It's called Falls of Light. It's called falls for a reason, young man. And, come on. Even before your ancestors were born, I've known this place like the back of my hand! [groans] Have it your way. But if I were you, I'd bring Ekis here right now. So his wounds can heal. And it's great to swim in this Brook of Light. The water is so clear. Falls! Stupid. He's right. Let's bring Ekis here so we can move forward. Here? You think this will heal Ekis? Um, excuse me. I've been here. So where are they? Ompong! Whoo! Bert, put that down and go for a swim! Asuang! Wanna go for a swim? You're stinky. Come on, it feels so nice! Asuang! Come down here. You're getting smelly! -Stop it! -[Miguel] You stink! -Hey! -Hey. What took you so long? -It's my brother. -What happened? Where is he? Go on, give him mouth to mouth resuscitation. -You want me to do it? -Yes, you. -Don't you know CPR? -[Miguel] Why don't you do it? I told you it won't work. It's my brother's piss. It's a scam. [whimpers] Brother.... [grunts] Damn! Damn! [groans] Brother! Good. The moon's behind the clouds. -[rumbling] -Whoa. -[Asuang] It's really coming. -[sighs] So we have to move fast. [Asuang] Tomorrow morning, we continue the climb. It's not safe at night. The guards are on the prowl. I know that. But we're running out of time. We have to take the shortcut. Where exactly is that shortcut? [sighs] It's past the brook and into the woodlands. There's a passageway there. That leads to the house of Gugurang. What you're saying is impossible. My father told me about that passageway. I believe him more than I believe you, Asuang! Hey! It's Ash-ang! Here's what, Asuang. We're a group anyway, so why don't we vote on it? All in favor of my shortcut? [Asuang] Fine. Have it your way. [Aica] Ash. This is my mission. Then that Dimalacap takes over. I was only forced by the priestesses to take him along. Chill, chill, chill, chill. And that enchanted hemp cord? He had it all along! Why didn't he share it with us? We're a team, right? He's too brassy for his age. You're pissed at us? I thought we were allies. Let's just get this mission over with before we all die. [shushes] [whining] -Help. -[both gasp] Can you spare me a piece of bread? -Here. -Sorry, I've eaten all my food. Is that what you do to keep hunger at bay? -What? -You keep it all in your belly? [all chuckling] By the way, did you pass through the brook? Yes. I was scared to drown. [scoffs] No reason to be scared. Remember, blubber floats in water. [all chuckling] -Are you happy now? -[chuckles] [Asuang clears throat] Uh, is it true? What? Is it true that fat guys have small dicks? [laughs] Small dick! Thanks for the food. -You can have this. -Thank you. -Here's more. -Thank you. -Here. -Can I have yours, too? -Sure! -Thank you. You're all so kind. Why don't you come with me to Onos' party? -No, thanks! -We're good. Thank you! -We're fine. -Thank you. -Are you sure? -We're fine here. I can get you in. [party music playing] [Asuang] They're all here. [Aica] What? I said they're all here! Aliyah, Bulan. All the gods are here. Even the social media personalities. Everyone I invited to my party, they're here. [Aica] Isn't that KitKat over there? Let her be. Harry Prince isn't here anyway. [chuckles] He's not here, see? Damn! Is that Harry Prince? [Aica] He's wearing the same clothes as the fat guy back there. No, it's probably a similar design. Or maybe that guy is an avid fan, you know. [chuckles] Hello, hello? Is this thing on? -Yeah! -[crowd cheering] -Thanks for all your support! -[crowd cheering] Just keep drinking that potion so we'd all look beautiful and handsome! [crowd cheering] Who throws a great party? -[crowd] Onos! Onos! Onos! -[Onos] I love it. -I love the energy! -[crowd] Onos! Onos! Onos! I lost you. Where were you? [Asuang] I got us these. -Why do you always steal stuff? -[grunts] When you have nothing, you want what you don't have. Instead of feeling envious, find a way to get it. Is that bad? -Of course, it is. -[groans, chuckles] Be careful, Aica. This stuff is strong. [laughs] Cheers! You were so mean to that guy. That fat guy who's as big as a wall? [chuckles] -Why? -That's so mean. Why don't you go ahead and call me darkie, or KitKat skinny? -I would call you arrogant. -I didn't say anything. You know, when I was younger, my skin was even darker than your soul. -[muffled party music] -Wow, -you know how to dish it. -I learn fast. -Phone. -Why? Add me. -I want to show you something. -Where? [laughs] -This is you? -Yeah, that's me. [chuckles] You're so light-skinned here. Don't tell me you've been drinking Onos' potion too? Don't ever do this again. -No, not ever. -You looked like espasol. -They might sell you in Laguna. -[chuckles] -[rumbling] -Whoa, whoa. -Bert? -[Bert] Yes, director? Come here for a second. [Bert] What is it? Don't tell anyone, okay? I wanna show you something. -[distant crowing] -[Bert] Whoa. Whoa. When was that? [Aica] Earlier, before Asuang and I stepped out. [Bert] Mm. What is she doing here? She could have come with us. I don't know. Hey, you two, help us wake up Asuang! [Ompong] How are we going to do that? He's sleeping like a log. [Miguel] Let him be. He's sleeping like a log. -[chuckles] -[groans] -[screams, yells] -Hold this. Wake up! Wake up! -Stop it! Help! I can't anymore! -Wake up, Asuang! Brother! -Hey, jerks, help me out here! -[wails] Wake up! Wake up! Breathe, breathe, breathe. Are you okay now? Let's turn back. It's okay to abort this mission. You might not be well enough to handle the Sacred Fire. -[dramatic music playing] -Or control it. You might have to go through all that pain again. It might be worse for you. Thank you for your concern. -And I'm sorry. -That's okay. After all, the fate of billions of lives rests in your hands, right? -[chuckles] -Wow, really? -That's good. -[both chuckling] -Are you this way all the time? -What do you mean? Are you being nice only because you need a story for your movie? Or is this really how documentary filmmakers are? [Bert coughing] Have you been there all this time? [clears throat] -Hey. It's him, the fat guy. -Yes. -Hey, you! -Oh. My dick is not tiny! It's as big as a gourd! -This is HP. -[Aica] Huh? -Him! It's HP! -[Aica] How do you know this? -Because I have a big dick. -[Aica chuckles] Harry Prince posts shirtless photos of himself. I have every one of them saved. For-- for research purposes, of course. Oh, he has a mole on his armpit. Here. -That one! Exactly that! -[Aica chuckles] [Harry Prince] I have a big dick, man. I don't care! You had us all fooled! You jerk. [sarcastic chuckle] Wow. Wow. [yells] Wow! Wow! You jerk. You know what? You only look good because you keep drinking Onos' potion! [Harry Prince] Fool, I go to the gym! Where in that body does it show you go to the gym? [Harry Prince] See that? Ew! Yuck! I saved all those pictures! And look at this jerk's stretch mark-ridden body! [wails] Damn! Idiot! [groans, grunts] Idiot. It was a scam, dude! Wooh! That jerk. He had me fooled. How dare he post those abs! Harry Prince is a fake! [bongos music playing] A big ass faker! I'm unfollowing him. Hey, Bert, come on up here! Be careful. [spits, yells] Gugurang! Fuck you! [chuckles] He can't come to me! Yeah, oh. Fuck you, Mayon! Oh, oh, fuck you, Mayon! # She has fair skin But there is something wrong # We're running out of time. It will be dark soon. We have to move quickly. Where is Director Aica? [Bert] She's over there, taking shots of the others. You know, during this season, my brother hires a crazy woman to organize the ritual. [KitKat] Asuang! Asuang! -Aica? -[Bert] Director? So anyway, there's a ritual. Then, the slaughtered animals are given to my brother as offerings. We have so much food in the house. [KitKat] Asuang! -Who is that? -[Bert] I can hear it, too. -You heard that? -[Bert] Yes. [KitKat] Below you! Hey. KitKat? What are you doing here? Go away! You're going to cause trouble here. [KitKat] Keep your voice down! Beware of Miguel! I overheard them at Onos' party. [KitKat clucking] They're going to offer you to Gugurang! [KitKat clucking] KitKat, if this is still because of our fight at the party, you're going to get it from me! I'll turn you into chicken soup! [whispers] No! I'm telling you the truth! He planned it all along with the old priestess. You have to leave now! Are you making this up? [Bert] Uh, sir, she might be telling the truth. You see, Aica showed me a video of Miguel and Ompong talking to Adelaida at the party. And when they went to take a piss, we heard them sort of planning something. [Aica] Miguel, why did you join this mission? Why? [Aica] I need it for the documentary. -I need money. -[Aica] What for? Should there be a reason to want money? -[Aica] How about you, Ompong? -[snarls] -[Ompong] I want... -Let's go. Come on. -[Ompong] Okay. -[Asuang snarls] [Bert] Careful. Uh, Director Aica, -I've seen the materials. -What material? Bert showed me some videos. -What video, Bert? -[clears throat] Wait, I'm confused. What-- what video? [Bert] Director, I'm sorry. I was previewing the materials then he looked over my shoulder. -You made me look like a fool! -Wait, what? Your shots were bad! I thought you were my hype man? What are you trying to do here? [stammers] We're trying to help you! You're helping me look stupid! Wait, okay, uh, let me explain. People already see me as the God of Sin. They already think I'm evil. What more are you trying to prove? Are you serious right now? Why would I joke about this? I thought you were a good filmmaker. [chuckles] What the hell? Turn it off, man. Just turn it off. No, no! Do not turn it off! Record all this girl's foolishness! You're an amateur! Bert, let's go. -Let's leave them. -No, Director Aica. You leave. You're the one we don't need in this mission. So get out of here. You know what? I thought people were wrong about you. I hope you die up there. I'm done. Bert, let's go. Robertino! Come on. -Where do we go, kid? -Here. This way. -Hurry up, Bert. -[Ompong] Go slow. [Miguel] Just go slowly. We're almost there. Which way do we go? -Why don't you go first? -[Miguel] Straight ahead. -This way or that? -[Bert] Why are you rushing? Hey! [grunts] Who supplies you with hemp cord, Miguel? Why do you have so much? Let me go! My apologies, god of sins. Just doing my job. [grunts] [Miguel] It's Lord Gugurang! [Gugurang] Well done, well done! Very well done! Bless us, Gugurang. Please take our offering and spare the world. -Do not destroy mankind. -Asuang! I've missed you. Asuang! He's unconscious? I've been shooting my mouth off! -Pompom, go get some water. -[Ompong] It's Ompong, sir. Pompom, I said go get some water! -Yes, my lord. -Don't talk back to me. Is this camera on? The priestesses asked us to bring Asuang to you, beloved Gugurang. [Gugurang] Will you please stop calling me beloved? You don't love me. Do you really love me? You, put that down. I'll speak to you two first. Miguel, thank you for your offering. You, Pompom, and the priestesses have my thanks. -It's Ompong, sir. -[Gugurang] Pompom. Magindang has been looking for you, Miguel. He knows it was you who took his trident. Guard. Wait! Wait. What is the meaning of this?! [Gugurang] Oh, Miguel, thank you for your offering. Go on. -Take him to Magindang. -Wait, please. [Gugurang] Go. Take him out of my sight! Get out! Now, it's your turn, Pompom. [singsongy] Pompom. Have mercy on me. [Gugurang] I sentence you to death for several cases of thievery! No, have mercy on me! You are truly the most powerful god. Please forgive me. [Gugurang] Please, can you speak to me naturally for once? All I ever hear are your memorized prayers! Is this language week? -Throw him into Mayon's crater! -Wait! [groans] Ouch, ouch, ouch! Ouch! God, please! Have mercy on me! [gasps] Whoa, it's raining! Gugurang. [Gugurang] Welcome home, brother! [yells] Let us go! [Gugurang] What? Do you think I'm stupid? [snarls] Is this what you mean by "equal"? [Gugurang] This, my brother, is called justice. If you are really the God of Good, then why do you have to kill mankind? People can change! [Gugurang laughing] What change? Sinning is man's nature! Even the aswangs, you killed them all. [yells] They did you no wrong! [Gugurang] Why? Why this concern for mankind? And even for aswangs? Haven't you seen "Shake, Rattle and Roll"? They eat people! Even the priestesses who offered you to me are cunning! Gugurang... Don't destroy the world. Please. [Gugurang] Why, Asuang, what do you think of yourself? A savior? [chuckles] You're the god of uselessness, and now you're a god who'll rot in that cage forever! Along with your friend. What's your name again? I'm Bert. Well, then, bye for now. I have to prepare myself for the destruction of the world. [snarls] That son of a whore. People were right about him! He's evil and a user! He's only nice when he wants something from you. He is very narcissistic! He's a narcissistic, motherfucking son of a bitch! [laughs] You missed me, didn't you? -Ouch, that hurts! -What are you doing here? -Wait. No, no. -Give me that, I'm going home. Aica, that wasn't me! It was KitKat you were fighting with. -KitKat? -Yes, we had to do it to get you away from Miguel and Ompong. Where's Bert? Just help me. We're going there to get them! It's siesta time, you know. So all the lazy people in Mayon are taking a nap! -What's siesta? -Procrastination time. Don't you have that? Aren't mortals lazy? -Let's go! Come on! -You're really a basher. It's action hero time! Come on. It's a miracle! You got my instructions right, KitKat! -Hey. -I know you so well, Asuang! -[Aica] Bert! -Director! I was so scared to death! I thought you weren't coming back for us! [Aica] I told you not to come! But we were talking about that sense of fulfillment. This is it. [Aica] Pipe down, Bert, they'll hear us! Director, if I didn't go with those traitors, they would know we were on to their betrayal. And if we try to escape then, they would surely catch us right away. Here we go. [grunts] Enough of that! Wait, I'll get the card from the camera. -[Aica] Where is it? -[Bert] Gugurang destroyed it. -[exhales] -Aica, sorry about earlier. [Aica chuckling] That's okay. You were so good. You looked exactly like Asuang. -[chuckles] -I believed you! My grandmother taught me how to act. -[exhales] -And I've gotten so good at it! Especially when the victim is pregnant. [Aica chuckling] Do you have everything? [Bert] I'll take that, Director. -Hurry! Let's go! -Okay, what do we do now? Okay, this is my final instruction, KitKat. -Take them down. -What? Let's not argue about this, Aica. Take them far away from here. And your meat? Okot is tied down at the foot of the volcano. -Chew on him all you want. -[chuckles] Sure! But... Director, I owe you so much already. So, please, just go. I shouldn't even have brought you here. What are you going to do? Uh, hello, I'm stealing the Sacred Fire. -That's the plan. -What about your content? [Bert] She's right. I can still film you with this camera. No, that's fine. Take whatever you have, edit it, and air it. And if it's not enough, then just discard it. -Aica. -Hmm? This is for you. Call your sister. But before that, I think you need to load up. You can't do ATM posts anymore. [chuckles] Just go. Just figure it out later. Wait. PIN? It's Ashang#1. A-S-H-A-N-G-#-1. Small letters only. No space. -Okay? Go. -I'm going to change this. Change what? A new PIN. -With what? -[sniffles] Asuang. A-S-U-A-N-G. Small letters, no space. Go, before I change my mind. [tongue clicks] Wait. We should take a picture. Oh, I never refuse a picture. Come on, let's do it. Look at the camera. You're still going to tag me, right? Right. Three, two, one. Cheese! Ashuang! -Ashuang. -Ashuang. That's great. You might go trending with me. Caption it with hashtag Asuang, the last groufie. [laughs] That was a joke! I would never trend. -Go on, go. -You're being dramatic. Go on already. You're moving too slow! [mystical music playing] [Aica shudders] What? That's enough. [folk music playing] Good evening, Albay! We're here at the University of Berbania where it is said that the Lord Gugurang will come. The question that is bothering us will be answered. The question that we're all longing for an answer. He's here. Come on. Uh, good evening, Lord Gugurang! Mankind has a question for you. It's been three months since the Sacred Fire's gone missing. Can you give us an update about that?

Sorry, director. Tikboy has a lot of questions. Just sit, keep still.

You can play with my ex 'cause she played me too. Oh, I remember it again. They said if you reverse your clothing... you'll find your way back. I'm still here!
