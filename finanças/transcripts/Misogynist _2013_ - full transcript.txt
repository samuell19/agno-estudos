I TOLD YOU TO WEAR THAT BLACK SUIT. YOU LOOK SHARP IN IT. LIKE I SAID, LONG NIGHT. LOSE THE GUM, TAKE TWO OF THESE. PERK YOU RIGHT UP. DO I EVEN WANT TO KNOW WHAT THESE ARE? NOT REALLY. JUST TAKE 'EM. AH. YOU THINK THEY'RE PISSED? WHO? THE GUYS? YEAH. JESUS, HOW MANY TIMES I GOTTA TELL YOU? KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE. IF THEY'VE WAITED THIS LONG, THEY'LL WAIT LONGER. SUSPENSE AND ANTICIPATION ARE POWERFUL WEAPONS TO HAVE IN YOUR ARSENAL. YOU GOTTA LEARN TO USE THAT. I'll TAKE THE LEAD ON THIS. YOU JUST KICK BACK AND LOOK DAZED. DON'T HAVE TO DO MUCH. YOU GOTTA BE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT TO LOOK AS FUCKED UP AS YOU DO RIGHT NOW. YOU WANT ME TO BRING CHERYL IN? LET'S PLAY IT BY EAR. SHOOT HER A CALL, HAVE HER ON STANDBY. I TOLD HER TO BE FREE TONIGHT. YOU WANT HER IN THE RED OR THE BLACK DRESS? LET'S GO WITH THE RED. LET'S GO WITH THE GREEN ONE. THE GREEN ONE SHE HAD ON LAST TIME. OH, RIGHT. PERFECT. YOU KNOW, I MET THESE TWO GIRLS LAST NIGHT. I COULD GIVE 'EM A CALL. I THINK THEY'D BE INTO IT. NO. I DON'T WANT TO OVERLOAD THESE BOYS JUST YET. IN FACT, HAVE CHERYL IN HERE. HAVE HER IN THE GREEN DRESS, BUT BRING A COUPLE OPTIONS. STRAIGHT HAIR, EASY MAKEUP, AND WHATEVER PERFUME SHE THINKS WILL DRIVE THOSE FUCKERS CRAZY. PERFECT. LAST CHANCE ON THE GIRLS. IT'S OKAY. CHERYL KNOWS WHAT TO DO. I DON'T LIKE SURPRISES. YEAH, BUT THESE GIRLS, LIKE THEY'LL DO ANYTHING I TELL THEM TO. HARRISON, HEAR ME. IT'S OKAY. FOCUS, MAN. FOCUS. KEEP IT IN YOUR PANTS. AHH! BUT YOUR ASS BELONGS TO ME TONIGHT. LET'S DO THIS. ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO YOUR MIND WHEN YOU SEE THAT WORD, "WOMEN"? COME ON, GUYS. IT'S NOT A TRICK QUESTION. ANYBODY? PUSSY. GOOD. WHAT ELSE? BITCHES. BITCHES. HMM, NOW, YOU SAY THAT, BUT ARE THEY REALLY BITCHES OR ARE THEY BITCHES 'CAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO CONTROL THEM? FUCK THAT. I KNOW HOW TO CONTROL THEM. MM-HMM. I HAVE NO DOUBT YOU KNOW HOW TO CONTROL SOME, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE REALLY ATTRACTIVE ONES, THE ONES THAT SEEM UNATTAINABLE. WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? HMM. YOU ALL CAME HERE THROUGH A REFERRAL. IT WAS ALL YOUR CHOICE. WHY'D YOU COME? CURIOSITY. THAT'S RIGHT. CURIOSITY. YOU HEARD YOUR FRIENDS RAVE ABOUT WHAT I TOLD THEM AND YOU HAD TO COME MEET ME FOR YOURSELF. THAT'S ONE EGO YOU'VE GOT. YOU HAVEN'T PROVEN SHIT. NEITHER HAVE YOU. NEITHER HAVE ANY OF YOU. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? YOU'RE TELLING ME THIS IS THE PICK OF THE LITTER WE HAVE TO WORK WITH? THIS IS WHAT WE GOT THIS WEEK. OKAY, FUCK YOU BOTH, MAN. THIS IS BULLSHIT. LET'S GO, GUYS. THIS IS A JOKE. COME ON, GUYS. LET'S GO. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE? HMM? WOMEN. YOU WANT TO CONTROL WOMEN. AND I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR REASON IS, WHETHER SOME HIGH SCHOOL GIRL BROKE YOUR HEART AT PROM OR YOU GOT MOMMY ISSUES. I DON'T CARE. YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE WHOEVER REFERRED YOU IS A PRODUCT OF MY TEACHING AND THEY'VE APPLIED IT SO SUCCESSFULLY THAT YOU HAD TO COME AND MEET THE SOURCE OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE-- ME. NOW WE ALL HAVE OUR PAST DEMONS OF WOMEN WHO HAVE FUCKED US UP, RIGHT? IF YOU'RE JUST LOOKING FOR PUSSY, I'M NOT SOME FUCKING PUA. LOOK THAT SHIT UP ONLINE. WHAT I AM GONNA DO IS TEACH YOU A SCIENTIFIC APPROACH TO CLAIMING WOMEN FOR WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT. NOW SIT THE FUCK DOWN OR GET THE FUCK OUT. SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA TEACH US THAT WE DON'T ALREADY KNOW, HUH, CHIEF? THIS BETTER NOT BE SOME KIND OF CAREER SCAM HERE. CHIEF? THAT'S GOOD. IS SHE HERE? I'M GLAD YOU ASKED. (HARRISON) CHERYL! OH, YEAH, SHE'S HERE. COME ON IN. GO ON, HONEY, HOP ON UP THERE AND KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT. NOW, WHY DID I DO THIS? WHY DID I BRING HER OUT HERE? YOU WANT US TO FUCK HER? (LAUGHS) YOU SHOULD BE SO LUCKY. BUT THAT'S EXACTLY THE KIND OF JUVENILE RESPONSE I EXPECTED. I DID IT BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT YOU DO TO WOMEN WHO LOOK LIKE THIS. DO WHAT? PUT HER ON A HIGHER LEVEL THAN YOU. WHY? HMM? BECAUSE OF THE WAY SHE LOOKS? THE WAY SHE ACTS? BULLSHIT. YOU DON'T KNOW US. WHAT, YOU THINK YOU'RE THE FIRST PEOPLE I'M HELPING? WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU? EVERYBODY'S GOT THEIR OWN SELF-INTEREST AT HAND. WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME IS TO ELIMINATE YOUR PERCEPTION THAT THIS CHICK IS ANY HARDER TO GET THAN SOME FAT-ASS BIMBO EATING PORK RINDS AT THE COUNTY FAIR. FUCK YOU, TREVOR. SHUT IT! I'M TRYING TO MAKE A POINT. ALL WOMEN ARE EXACTLY THE SAME. OKAY, THERE ARE SOME UNDENIABLE TRUTHS. ONE, EVERY WOMAN, FROM A CATHOLIC SCHOOLGIRL TO A VICTORIA'S SECRET MODEL WANTS TO GET FUCKED. TWO, ALL WOMEN WANT TO BE HURT. NOT PHYSICALLY ALL THE TIME, BUT EMOTIONALLY. WHATEVER. THEY LOVE THAT STING. AND THE THIRD UNDENIABLE TRUTH IS THAT ALL WOMEN WANT TO BE CONTROLLED, AND I'M HERE TO TEACH YOU HOW TO CONTROL SO ABSOLUTELY THAT THEY WILL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. IT GOES WAY BEYOND ROMANCE AND LOVE. IT'S AN ADDICTIVE NEED TO PUT US, THE MAN, BEFORE THEIR OWN NEEDS, NO MATTER HOW SICK AND TWISTED IT IS. SO WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY IS YOU THINK ALL WOMEN ARE SPINELESS, FUCK-HUNGRY BITCHES THAT WANT US TO CONTROL THEM? I'M NOT TRYING TO SAY IT. I SAID IT. YES. HOW CAN YOU JUST STAND THERE AND LISTEN TO THIS? I MEAN, DOESN'T IT OFFEND YOU? OR IS SHE JUST A PAID ACTRESS? (TREVOR) PAID ACTRESS. DOES THAT LOOK LIKE ACTING, DIPSHITS? SHE NEVER ANSWERED THE QUESTION. THAT'S 'CAUSE SHE'S THE HIRED SLUT. HIRED SLUT. THAT'S A GOOD ONE. NEXT TIME YOU OPEN THAT SHIT HOLE OF YOURS, I SUGGEST YOU THINK ABOUT IT FIRST. IT'S ONE THING IF I CALL HER NAMES, BUT WHEN YOU DO IT, IT JUST SOUNDS DOWNRIGHT DEGRADING. (GRUNTING) YOU GOT THAT, YOU FUCK! HEY! FUCKER! ASSHOLE! YOU GOT THAT? DUDE, HOLY SHIT. ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND? NOT AT ALL. JUST WATCH WHAT YOU SAY AND THAT GOES FOR YOU AS WELL. YOU'RE IN MY HOUSE HERE. OKAY. YOU WILL SHOW ME THE RESPECT I DESERVE. ALL RIGHT, DUDE, YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH. I'M GONNA BOUNCE, MAN. NO, NO, NO. YEAH, YOU'LL MISS THE FUN PART. FUCK OUT OF HERE. COME ON. COME ON, BROTHER. COME ON. HOW DO YOU FEEL, HUH? LIKE SHIT, YOU ASSHOLE. COME HERE. HEY. ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT, OKAY? IT WAS OUT OF LINE. I HAD TO MAKE A STATEMENT. A SIMPLE "SHUT UP" WOULD HAVE WORKED. IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE THE PANACHE. YOU MUST THINK WE'RE FUCKING NUTS FOR NOT CALLING THE COPS OR GETTING THE HELL OUT OF HERE. NOT REALLY. IT WOULD JUST BE ONE PERSON'S WORD AGAINST THE OTHER. UH, NO, IT WOULDN'T BECAUSE WE ALL SAW WHAT YOU DID. DID YOU GUYS SEE IT? I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING. OH, FUCK, DUDE! YOU GUYS ARE NUTS, MAN. YOU KNOW WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA ANSWER HIS QUESTION, LADY, HUH? (CHERYL) WELL, I-- (TREVOR) SHE DOESN'T HAVE AN OPINION ON THE TOPIC. YEAH, OF COURSE. I NEVER SAID THAT, TREVOR. JESUS CHRIST. DUDE, I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WERE DONE-- STAY BACK. DON'T TOUCH HER! (CHERYL) WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO THAT FOR? "CAUSE I CAN. FUCK WAS THAT ABOUT? SHUT UP. WATCH. SHH. DOES IT HURT? WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK? (GASPING AND WHIMPERING) (MAN) HEY, TREVOR! STAY AWAY. DON'T TOUCH HER! ALL RIGHT, JUST WATCH. SHH, SHH. ARE YOU GONNA FUCKING HELP ME? SHUT UP, CHERYL. SEE THIS? THIS... THIS IS WHAT YOUR APPROACH TO WOMEN SHOULD BE. THEY ARE LOWER THAN YOU. THEY ARE INJURED. AND YOU ARE THERE TO HELP THEM. HEY, HEY. (PANTING) AND THEN SCREW THEM OVER. SIMPLE. GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE AND ICE THAT SHIT. YOU SEE THAT? THAT'S RESPECT. SHE MAY NOT SHOW IT, BUT SHE'LL BE BACK. AT THE END OF THE DAY, ALL WOMEN WANT A MAN TO PUT THEM IN THEIR PLACE. IT'S A SUBCONSCIOUS DESIRE THAT GOES BACK THOUSANDS OF YEARS. TO THEM, THEY FEEL PROTECTED. YOU GUYS NEED TO LEARN HOW TO HARNESS THAT AMAZING GIFT AND USE IT TO YOUR ADVANTAGE. AND NEVER LET A WOMAN THINK THAT SHE CAN CONTROL YOU. SIT DOWN. SIT BACK DOWN. THAT'S RESPECT? A WOMAN SPITTING IN YOUR FACE? YOU'RE FUCKING CRAZY. IT'S A LOVE/HATE THING WITH US. DID YOU REALLY KNOW HER? SIT DOWN. WOULD IT MATTER IF I DID? UH, YEAH. THAT'S ASSAULT. I MEAN, USING A GIRL IS ONE THING, BUT HURTING HER? CUTS AND BRUISES EVENTUALLY HEAL. EMOTIONAL SCARRING DOESN'T. WHETHER SHE WANTS TO ADMIT IT OR NOT, A WOMAN'S BRAIN IS LIKE A FUCKING SPONGE. THEY WILL REMEMBER EVERYTHING FROM THAT PIMPLY-FACED HIGH SCHOOL BOY THAT REJECTED THEM ALL THE WAY TO THE ALPHA MALE THAT FUCKED 'EM ON A DRUNKEN ONE-NIGHT STAND. AND FROM THE LOOKS OF YOU, PRETTY BOY, I'M SURE YOU'VE BROKEN A FEW HEARTS, SO DON'T PLAY SAINT WITH ME. YOU'RE JUST A FUCKING ASSHOLE. YOU ASSAULT A WOMAN IN AN ALLEY AND IN THE SCUFFLE, YOUR WALLET FALLS OUT, YEAH, SHE'S GONNA REPORT YOU. BUT YOU BUILD RAPPORT WITH THAT WOMAN FIRST AND SHE'LL BE BACK. PRETTY WEIRD, HUH? (SIGHS) NO, IT'S THE VALIDATION OF KNOWING THAT DEEP DOWN YOU STILL CARE. EVEN IF HE IS BEATING HER ASS. GOOD. HMM. YOU GUYS LEARN QUICK. I LIKE THAT. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY? WHY? "CAUSE YOU'RE STILL HERE. YOU DIDN'T BITCH OUT LIKE MOST. YOUR FRIENDS CHOSE YOU WELL THEN. I'M PLEASED WITH THAT. NOW I'M GONNA ASK YOU AGAIN. WHY DID YOU COME HERE, BESIDES CURIOSITY? WHAT DID YOUR FRIENDS TELL YOU ABOUT ME? PROBABLY SOMETHING I TOLD THEM THEY SHOULD KEEP QUIET. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, YOU STILL SEEM LIKE A PRETTY SICK FUCK. WHY? BECAUSE OF THAT? TELL ME YOU HAVEN'T FANTASIZED ABOUT TRULY OWNING A WOMAN. HAVING TOTAL CONTROL. YOU JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT YET. WHY WOULD I WANT TO DO THAT? IF YOU DON'T WANT TO, IF THIS IS TOO MUCH TO ASK, NOW'S THE TIME TO GO. NO HARM, NO OFFENSE TAKEN. I DON'T KNOW YOU, YOU DON'T KNOW ME, AND WE WON'T TALK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IF YOU DO AND YOU TRY TO TAKE ME DOWN, I SWEAR TO GOD, I WILL GET SOMEBODY TO LITERALLY FUCK YOU UP YOUR ASS. AM I CLEAR ON THAT? NOBODY'S HOLDING YOU GUYS IN SHACKLES HERE. YOU'RE FREE TO GO. I'll HOLD NO JUDGMENT. CAN WE HAVE A SECOND TO THINK ABOUT IT? TAKE ALL THE TIME YOU NEED. (MAN) AND, DUDE, THIS GUY'S A TRAMP. (MAN 2) THAT GUY IS A SOCIOPATH. HE IS A SOCIOPATH, HUH? HE'S LOST HIS FUCKING MIND IN THERE. BUT HE MAY KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. ARE YOU SERIOUS? YEAH, I'M SERIOUS. HEY, THAT WOMAN COULD HAVE BEEN AN ACTRESS. YOU'RE RIGHT. SHE COULD HAVE BEEN. OH, SHE COULD HAVE BEEN, HUH? NAH, I DOUBT IT. I SAW HER FACE. TRUST ME, SHE WAS IN REAL PAIN. JUST LAYING RIGHT THERE. WHAT IF SHE WAS A METHOD ACTRESS, HUH? STRASBERG! METHOD? (LAUGHTER) (ALL TALKING AT ONCE) WHO INVITED YOU TO THIS? A FRIEND. WHO INVITED YOU? A FRIEND, BUT JUST BECAUSE I SHOWED UP DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE TO STAY. I MEAN, |-- I DON'T KNOW. OH, YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. WHAT? YOU'RE PROBABLY WORRIED, HUH? MAYBE YOUR MOM'S GONNA CALL TO SEE HOW YOU'RE DOING. MEANWHILE, DUDE, WE'RE GONNA BE LEARNING SOME SHIT. LEARNING HOW TO TAKE IT. HUH? HUH? YOU'RE GONNA LEARN HOW TO SODOMIZE WOMEN. THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT. OH, SODOMIZE. YOU NEVER KNOW, HUH? IT DOESN'T LEAVE THE ROOM, THOUGH, HUH? MAYBE I'll JUST WATCH YOU GUYS. LIKE A FLY ON THE WALL. SUCH DOUCHES. DUDE, YOU'RE AS BIG A DOUCHE AS WE ARE. WE JUST ADMIT IT. DID YOU GUYS SEE THAT HOT PIECE THAT CAME IN? OH, MY GOD. YEAH, I'VE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT HER FOR 18 YEARS. EIGHTEEN YEARS. YES, SHE WAS LIKE THE UNICORN. SHE DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT-- SHE WAS LIKE THE UNICORN! SHE DOESN'T LIKE HIM, OBVIOUSLY. LOOK HOW HE TREATS HER. SHE'D LIKE SOMEONE WHO WOULD TREAT HER WITH SOME RESPECT. OH, YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU SHOULD PROBABLY PUT ON THAT LITTLE SWEATER YOU HAVE WITH THE BUTTONS, MAYBE PART YOUR HAIR. THIS GUY! (LAUGHS) FUCK YOU. PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE NOT LEAVING, DUDE. PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE NOT LEAVING. YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M GONNA STICK AROUND "CAUSE I'D LOVE TO SEE YOU LOSE ONE MORE KIDNEY AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU BENT OVER ON THAT LITTLE PODIUM THAT SHE WAS ON. SO PLEASE, JOIN ME.

YOU GUYS AREN'T DOGS BEGGING FOR A TREAT AND I'M NOT HERE TO JUMP THROUGH HOOPS FOR YOU. I'M JUST HERE TO OPEN YOUR EYES TO SOMETHING MEN SHOULD ALREADY BE AWARE OF. WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT GIRL, BY THE WAY? SHE'S STILL HERE. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT. SO WHEN DO WE GET TO MEET YOUR LITTLE HELPER OVER THERE? HE'LL MAKE AN INTRO IN A BIT. WE'RE ALL STILL GETTING ACQUAINTED HERE. NOW YOU, TRAVIS, YOU SAID, WHAT ELSE DO WE HAVE FOR YOU? WELL, I'M GONNA TURN IT AROUND AND ASK WHAT DO YOU HAVE FOR ME? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHY ARE YOU HERE? HMM, ALL OF YOU. I TOLD YOU I WAS CURIOUS. AND YOU'VE KEPT MY INTEREST SO FAR DESPITE BEING A FUCKING SOCIOPATH. (ALL SNICKERING) YEAH. WELL, I KNOW IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE [T, BUT I'M LIKE DRANO, CLEANSING YOUR SYSTEM OF ALL THE PC BULLSHIT YOU GUYS LEARNED THROUGHOUT THE YEARS GROWING UP. GREAT, SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA POISON US ALONG THE WAY. YEAH. ACTUALLY, HE'S NOT THAT BAD. I WILL GIVE YOU PROPS FOR PULLING A WOMAN LIKE THAT, ALL RIGHT? MAD RESPECT, DUDE. GEE, THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAN SUCK MY DICK AFTER. (LAUGHS) SHUT UP. I'M TALKING ABOUT WHAT YOUR FRIENDS TOLD YOU ABOUT ME THAT WOULD MAKE YOU WANT TO COME DOWN HERE INTO SOME STRANGER'S PLACE AND GET ENLIGHTENED. WELL, I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR ALL OF US, BUT I'M PRETTY SURE WE ALL HEARD THAT YOU KNOW HOW TO FUCK WOMEN, ANY TYPE. HMM. WOMEN DON'T FUCK ME, GUYS. THEY FUCK THEMSELVES. EVERY TIME THEY LET ME GET INSIDE THEIR HEAD WITH WHATEVER MINDFUCK BULLSHIT I SAY TO THEM AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT. THAT'S THE TYPE OF MENTALITY YOU NEED TO HAVE TOWARDS WOMEN. ALL WOMEN HAVE A SELF-DESTRUCTIVE GENE THAT MAKES THEM WANT TO GET FUCKED OVER. THAT'S WHY IT HAPPENS SO OFTEN. WHY ARE YOU SHAKING YOUR HEAD? "CAUSE THAT'S HORSESHIT. THEY'RE NOT THAT DUMB. NO? NO, THEY'RE NOT. DID YOU NOT SEE WHAT HAPPENED EARLIER? TO THE GIRL? WHAT YOU SAW IS WHAT IS POSSIBLE IF YOU SHUT UP AND LISTEN TO ME. I DON'T WANT TO HURT 'EM. FUCK 'EM, YEAH, BUT NOT HURT 'EM. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO TO 'EM, AS LONG AS YOU CAN USE THEM FOR WHATEVER YOU WANT. IT'S TIMES LIKE THIS OUR GENDER'S BEEN CASTRATED THROUGH PROPAGANDIST BULLSHIT RHETORIC THAT EMASCULATES US. AND WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU'RE FEEDING US RIGHT NOW, DUDE, HUH? WHAT I'M FEEDING YOU IS SOMETHING TO SATISFY YOUR, YOUR DESIRE TO USE WOMEN FOR WHAT EVER THE HELL YOU WANT. DOES ANY OF THIS CRAP YOU'RE TALKING ACTUALLY WORK? I MEAN, SEEING YOU PUSH OVER THAT BITCH DOESN'T EXACTLY CONVINCE ME. LET ME PROVE IT TO YOU THEN. WHY DON'T YOU GUYS TAKE A SEAT? WANT TO TAKE IT FROM HERE? MY PLEASURE. THOSE PILLS DID HELP, YOU KNOW. I WAS ENJOYING THE SHOW YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN PUTTING ON. HEY, FUCK YOU, MAN. PROVING MY POINT. WHO THE FUCK IS THIS GUY? WHY DON'T YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP AND LET HIM TALK?

WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. YOU'RE NOT GONNA LET SOME LITTLE SCUFFLE MAKE YOU LEAVE NOW, ARE YOU? ARE YOU GUYS SOME FUCKING CULT? YOU LIKE RECRUITING PEOPLE AND JUST FUCKING WITH THEIR HEADS? AND IT'S NOT ONE SCUFFLE. HE'S A FUCKING LUNATIC AND HE'S LOSING IT. I'M NOT GONNA CALL THE COPS, I JUST WANT OUT. SETTLE DOWN THERE, CUPCAKE. OKAY, HE'S NOT GONNA MAKE YOU-- OKAY, WELL, IT WAS TREVOR'S FAULT. HE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I TAKE IT AS A COMPLIMENT, YOU KNOW. HE WAS TRYING TO PROTECT HIS FAVORITE PRODIGY-- ME. YOU'RE JUST AS FUCKING DELUSIONAL AND NARCISSIST AS HE IS. YOU GUYS FUCKING BELONG TOGETHER. LOOK, JARED. I GOT-- HEY, HEY, HEY. DON'T.

YOU APPLY THAT SHIT TOWARDS CONTROLLING WOMEN, THERE'LL BE NO STOPPING YOU. HOW DO YOU KNOW I DON'T DO IT ALREADY? YOU DON'T KNOW ME. THAT'S EXACTLY THE KIND OF ANSWER I LOVE. (SNAPS FINGERS) YOU THINK SHE'S ATTRACTIVE? I THINK ANY MAN WITH A STRAIGHT DICK WOULD. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO WITH HER? OR TO HER? I'M NOT INTO FUCKING WHORES, MAN. JESUS CHRIST! I'M NOT A FUCKING WHORE, ASSHOLE. LOOK, FOCUS, JARED. FOCUS. SHE'S NOT A WHORE, OKAY? I CAN ATTEST TO THAT. NOW, THE REASON [I'M ASKING IS BECAUSE, HONESTLY, YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE OF THESE DICKWADS HERE THAT CAN ACTUALLY GRASP WHAT I'M TRYING TO TEACH. I THINK I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE. NO, JUST STAY ANOTHER FEW MINUTES. WHY? BECAUSE IF YOU LEAVE NOW, YOU'RE GONNA BE WONDERING ALL THE WAY HOME WHETHER I WAS SERIOUS ABOUT LETTING YOU FUCK THIS SERIOUSLY HOT CHICK. I THINK I'M DOING JUST FINE ON MY OWN. WHAT DID YOUR FRIENDS TELL YOU ABOUT ME, HUH, THAT MOTIVATED YOU TO COME? THOSE OTHER DICKWADS, THEY JUST WANTED TO FUCK, BUT YOU, I SAW THAT TWINKLE IN YOUR EYE THAT TOLD ME YOU WANTED A LITTLE BIT MORE, HMM? YOU CAN SELL THAT BULLSHIT TO YOURSELF, BUT DON'T ASK ME TO FUCK-- WHAT DID HE TELL YOU?! WHAT DID YOUR FRIEND TELL YOU? IT WASN'T A FRIEND! IT WAS MY BROTHER! HE CAME AND SAW YOU WHEN HE WAS GETTING A DIVORCE. FUCKING WHORE CHEATED ON HIM. AND HE SAID AFTER HE SAW YOU, HE JUST FELT LIBERATED AND HE HAD A CLEAR PEACE OF MIND. AND HIS OUTLOOK CHANGED FOREVER, FOR THE BETTER. SO I CAME TO THE SOURCE TO SEE IF IT WAS TRUE. I WAS FUCKING WRONG. NO, GOOD. JUST... DO YOU LOVE YOUR BROTHER? OF COURSE I DO. YEAH? WHEN SHE DID THAT TO HIM, DID IT HURT YOU? YEAH. YEAH? WHAT'D YOU WANT TO DO TO HER? FUCK HER. YEAH, EXACTLY. WHY, HMM? BECAUSE OF WHAT SHE DID TO HIM. DO YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH? THE TRUTH IS IT WASN'T HER FAULT. IT WAS HIS. HOW IS IT HIS FAULT? SHE WAS THE ONE WHO CHEATED AND TOOK ALL THE MONEY. IT WAS HIS FAULT BECAUSE HE LOST SIGHT OF WHO HE WAS. HE LET HIS BITCH CONTROL HIM, WHICH IS THE FIRST CARDINAL SIN. WHAT? WHAT? YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME? YOU COULD ASK HIM, HE'LL BE THE FIRST ONE TO ADMIT IT. I'VE SEEN THIS SITUATION ALL TOO OFTEN. THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ME! BUT IT WILL IF YOU DON'T LISTEN TO ME AND LEARN! BE ONE OF THE FEW THAT CAN BOAST THAT NO WOMEN WILL EVER AFFECT THEM BECAUSE YOU ARE THE ONE IN CONTROL. YOU'RE FUCKING NUTS. HMM, I KNOW. I'M JUST ONE OF THE FEW THAT HAVE ACCEPTED IT. NO. HUH-HUH. I LISTENED ENOUGH. I'M LEAVING. OKAY, WAIT. COME BACK NEXT WEEK, OKAY? WE'LL FINISH THIS DISCUSSION. I'll HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT. AFTER ALL, YOU DID BEAT MY ASS. EVERYBODY CAN USE A LITTLE ASS-KICKING NOW AND THEN. CONSIDER IT TOUGH LOVE. IT'S BEEN INTERESTING, TREVOR. I'M LEAVING. WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING? I TOLD YOU I WAS LEAVING. THE FIRST THING YOU SAID TO ME TONIGHT WAS "PUSSY" IN RESPONSE TO WHAT WAS THE FIRST THING THAT CAME TO YOUR MIND WHEN YOU SAW THE WORD "WOMAN." NOW YOU GOT A WOMAN IN FRONT OF YOU. I SUGGEST YOU DO SOMETHING. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? JESUS CHRIST. IT'S NOT WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO. IT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO. I'M NOT EXACTLY BUYING THIS MORAL DILEMMA BULLSHIT YOU'RE TRYING TO SELL ME HERE. YOU GOT A WOMAN IN FRONT OF YOU. USE HER. PRETEND SHE'S YOUR BROTHER'S WIFE. MMM. PRETEND SHE'S YOUR WIFE. MM-HMM. SHE'S OUT LATE. MAYBE SHE'S FUCKING SOME OTHER GUY. BAD. YEAH, BAD. IF WE DON'T CONTROL THEM, THEY RUN WILD LIKE BEASTS, JARED. DON'T BE THE ABUSED, BE THE ABUSER. USE HER BEFORE SHE USES YOU.

WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE ANYWAY? IT'S FUCKING FREEZING. WE'RE HAVING A MAN-TO-MAN DISCUSSION, CHERYL, SO WHY DON'T YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE? MMM, SUCH AN ASSHOLE. HARRISON, TRY NOT TO END UP EXACTLY LIKE THIS GUY. NOW. GOD, I LOVE FUCKING WITH THAT CHICK. SO EASY. SHE PUTS UP WITH EVERYTHING. DOES IT EVER BOTHER YOU? WHAT? CHERYL FUCKING RANDOM GUYS. WHY WOULD IT? I FUCK OTHER WOMEN. YEAH, I KNOW THAT, BUT IT' S LIKE YOU ALWAYS SAY, THE MAN SHOULD ALWAYS BE IN CONTROL. DON'T LET THE WOMEN RUN WILD, SO... I AM IN CONTROL OF THE SITUATION. I CREATE THE SITUATION. PROVED ANY POTENTIAL GUY THAT NOTHING'S OUT OF REACH FOR US. DOESN'T MATTER. MARRIED, DATING, Bl, DYKE, TRANNY-- DOESN'T MAKE ANY FUCKING DIFFERENT. IT ALL WORKS THE SAME. I DO IT TO MAKE A POINT. YOU DON'T THINK SHE DOES IT WHEN YOU'RE NOT AROUND? NO. WHY? BECAUSE I CONTROL HER. OKAY, SHE DOESN'T DISRESPECT ME. WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING, MUCH LIKE YOU AND APRIL, I'M SURE. COME ON, MAN. COME ON. I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN WEEKS. WHAT'S GOING ON? ARE YOU AVOIDING ME? IS THAT IT? NO.

YOU'RE LUCKY SHE DIDN'T GO FOR YOUR HEART. YEAH, MY HEART. PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE FELT IT. (CHUCKLES) WHAT HAPPENED AFTER IT? IT'S A BIG CITY. I DON'T KNOW. SHE-- YOU KNOW, AFTER THE LITTLE SPAT, I WAS ABLE TO CALM HER DOWN THROUGH MY INTENSE POWER OF PERSUASION. WHICH WAS? MY COCK. OH, FUCK! (GASPING) FUCK! GOD. (GRUNTING AND PANTING) FUCK. OH, FUCK.

YEAH, SERIOUS, YEAH. YEAH, LIKE DITCHING A LATE-NIGHT DINNER WITH THE IN-LAWS SERIOUS. TWENTY MINUTES? DON'T FUCK ME OVER, ALL RIGHT? I OWE YOU. ALL RIGHT. (HANGS UP PHONE) JESUS CHRIST. A BODY LIKE THAT, I'M SURPRISED I'D FORGET ABOUT YOU. (TREVOR) LIKE I SAID, I DON'T KNOW. I HAVEN'T SEE HER. IT'S A BIG CITY. I'M SURE SHE'S SPREADING HER LEGS SOMEWHERE. BUT ENOUGH ABOUT THAT BITCH. HONESTLY, SOMETIMES I DON'T KNOW HOW I'VE PUT UP WITH YOU THIS LONG. I REALLY DON'T. LISTEN, SERIOUSLY, LOOK AT ME. I WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME SOMETHING, OKAY? I'M SERIOUS. YEAH. PROMISE ME. WHAT? WITH APRIL, ON THAT BEAUTIFUL WEDDING DAY, I WANT YOU TO ENJOY THE RECEPTION, OKAY? I WANT YOU TO ENJOY IT. I WANT YOU TO EAT THE MARVELOUS CAKE, I WANT YOU TO DRINK THE DELICIOUS WINE, I WANT YOU TO DANCE YOUR ASS OFF. BUT WHEN THE SMOKE'S CLEARED AND YOU'RE ALONE WITH HER, I WANT YOU TO FUCK THE SHIT OUT OF HERE. YOU HEAR ME? I WANT YOU TO FUCK THE SHIT OUT OF HER. I WANT YOU TO OPEN THE GATES OF HEAVEN AND FUCK HER SO HARD, I SWEAR TO GOD, SHE'LL WISH SHE WAS ALREADY THERE. YOU GOT THAT? DUDE, WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT ALREADY? NORMALLY I SEAL THE DEAL IN ONE NIGHT. THIS HAS BEEN THREE FUCKING YEARS IN THE MAKING. YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME, OKAY? YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME. I'M SERIOUS. I WANT YOU TO TEAR THE BITCH UP. MAKE HER PAY FOR MAKING YOU WAIT THREE YEARS LIKE THAT. YOU'RE MY GOLDEN BOY. FINE. ANYTHING ELSE, MASTER? WELL, NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT... OH, FUCK. COME ON, LET'S DO IT. REALLY? ONCE AGAIN WE'RE GONNA DO THIS? WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME WE SPARRED? COME ON! WHEN YOU DRUNK AND I DROVE YOUR DRUNK ASS HOME AND YOU PUKED IN THE BACK OF MY CAR. I WAS FUCKED UP, MAN, BUT YOU SUCKER-PUNCHED ME. YOU LOSE EVERY TIME. IT'S NOT GONNA END WELL. FUCK OFF. YOU'RE JUST TOO SLOW. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. MY FUCKING ARM, YOU... BITCH. (MAN ON TV) WOULD I EVER PUT YOU IN DANGER? (WOMAN ON TV) EVERY TIME YOU GO OUT AND DO THIS, YOU DO. WHY DO YOU KEEP DOING THIS TO YOURSELF? I GET IT, SHE WAS YOUR SISTER. I GET IT. WE SHOULD GO OUT... WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? MIND YOUR OWN FUCKING BUSINESS. HARRISON KICK YOUR ASS AGAIN? SIT. SOMETHING GOING ON BETWEEN YOU TWO? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? ARE YOU FUCKING HIM? UH, YEAH. YOU ASKED ME TO ANYWAYS. THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR. (UNZIPPING) NOW, GET DOWN. (GROANING) MY MOUTH HURTS. I DON'T WANT TO. WHY DON'T YOU WATCH ONE OF YOUR VIDEOS? I GET TIRED OF WATCHING YOU FINGER FUCK YOURSELF. (GRUNTS) SIT DOWN. HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. I'M GONNA DRINK THIS BEER, WATCH SOME TV, AND YOU'RE GONNA CHOW DOWN ON MY COCK. AND I DON'T CARE WHO YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT OR FANTASIZE TO GET THROUGH IT, BUT YOU ARE GOING TO DO IT. AM I PERFECTLY FUCKING CLEAR? YES. I DIDN'T UNZIP THEM TO FEEL A BREEZE. I MEAN RIGHT FUCKING NOW. GET DOWN. BE CAREFUL, MY BALLS ARE KILLING ME. FUCK YOU. HOLD ON. HOLD ON A SECOND. WHAT NOW? ARE YOU SERIOUS? I'M NOT DOING THIS FOR YOU. I WANT TO SEE ME. OH, FUCK THAT. SIT DOWN! STOP MOVING AROUND. SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. YOU WANNA WATCH YOURSELF WHILE I GO DOWN ON YOU, WHY? JUST HUMOR ME. (SIGHS) (GRUNTING) ACTION. (PHONE RINGING) (RINGING CONTINUES) OH, FUCK. HEY, BABY, WHAT'S UP? YEAH, SORRY I MISSED YOUR CALL. I'M JUST WAKING UP. (GROANING) OH. UH, NOTHING. THAT'S NOTHING. THAT'S JUST, UM, THAT'S JUST THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO WAKE UP THE DOGS, YOU KNOW? NO, I KNOW. (LAUGHS) I KNOW. WELL, YOU SHOULD TRY TO COME TO DINNER WITH ME TONIGHT WITH MY FAMILY. UH, TONIGHT? NO. I, UH, I DON'T THINK I'll BE ABLE TO DO THAT. I PROMISED AN OLD FRIEND THAT I WOULD, UH... THAT I WOULD GO TO HIS EVENT, SO... OKAY, NO, NO. IT'S-- NO, IT'S FINE. WE'LL DO IT ANOTHER TIME. YEAH. SO... OH, YEAH, TOMORROW, TOMORROW? TOMORROW SOUNDS GREAT. YEAH. DINNER? YOUR TREAT? (CHUCKLES) OKAY. OKAY, WELL, I HAVE TO GO "CAUSE THE FOOD'S HERE. ALL RIGHT. I'll CALL YOU LATER, ALL RIGHT? I LOVE YOU. (CHUCKLES) THIS LOOKS DELICIOUS. THANK YOU. DID YOU REALLY HAVE TO DO THAT? OF COURSE I DID. HARRISON, I ASSUME? OF COURSE. WHAT'S WRONG? YOU NERVOUS? ABOUT WHAT? I MEAN, YEAH. A LITTLE BIT. BUT THAT'S NORMAL, RIGHT? I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAD TO BUY YOUR OWN WEDDING RING. OH, MOM, COME ON. CAN WE DROP THIS? I'D SAY YOU INTERROGATE HIM ENOUGH. YOU KNOW, MAYBE I SHOULD BE INTERROGATING YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE. HONEY, HE SKIPS CHURCH, HE NEVER PAYS FOR A THING, AND YOU NEVER GET TO SEE HIM AT HIS SUPPOSED WORK. NOW, I KNOW MEN. AND THAT DOES NOT ADD UP. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I TOLD YOU, I HAVE TO GO. YOU BETTER NOT HAVE GIVEN ME ANY MORE HICKEYS. I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO WEAR A SCARF FOR ANOTHER TWO WEEKS. DON'T WORRY, YOUR BEAUTIFUL SKIN IS FINE, HARRISON. HE WANTS HIS SPACE, MOTHER. AND | HAVE TO RESPECT THAT. HARRISON HAS STOOD BY ME FOR THREE YEARS. I MEAN, THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST AMAZING TIME IN MY LIFE. AND ONCE WE'RE MARRIED, I PROMISE TO YOU THAT HE WILL PROVE THE TYPE OF MAN HE IS TO YOU. HE BETTER OR I'll CASTRATE HIM. OH, MOM, COME ON. ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY. I WENT TOO FAR. I WILL BACK OFF. YOU ENJOY YOUR FOOD AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT SOMETHING PLEASANT. HARRISON IS PLEASANT. SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOUR SISTER FOR ME, OKAY? BYE, ASSHOLE. BYE. (MAKES KISSING SOUNDS) (GIGGLES) DON'T WORRY, I TOLD HER. HUH. (SIGHS) YOU REALLY THINK I DON'T KNOW WHO THIS IS JUST BECAUSE THE NUMBER'S BLOCKED? OH, GOD, YOU ARE RELENTLESS. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU KEEP GETTING IN TOUCH WITH ME, BUT YOU DO IT AGAIN AND I'M GONNA HURT YOU WORSE THAN I DID THE FIRST TIME. AND YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT GETTING NEAR APRIL AGAIN AND I WILL BURY YOU! DO YOU HEAR ME? YOU DON'T TALK TO HER, YOU DON'T TRY TO GET TO HER. SHE-- HEY! DON'T YOU CUT ME OFF, DO YOU HEAR ME? I AM DEAD SERIOUS. AND DON'T YOU TEST ME. BECAUSE WITH YOUR TRACK RECORD, THEY WILL LOCK YOU UP SO FAST AND YOU WILL FINALLY BE GETTING FUCKED THE WAY YOU DESERVE. NOW FUCK OFF! (SIGHS) (HARRISON) TREVOR SAYS THERE'S NO END TO THIS CYCLE. I DISAGREE. IT ENDS WHEN YOU FEEL THE WORST PERSON IN THE WORLD IS THE ONE YOU'RE LOOKING AT IN THE MIRROR. I HAVEN'T HIT THAT YET. EVERY SINGLE WOMAN I SEE IS NOT AN OBJECT OF SEXUAL DESIRE. THEY ARE A TEST. A SIMPLE OBSTACLE TO DEVOUR AND SPIT OUT LIKE MOUTHWASH. EXCEPT THEY DON'T CLEAN ME. THEY ARE VENOM. AND THE ONLY ANTIDOTE IS TO GO ON TO THE NEXT ONE. AS FOR APRIL, WELL, SHE HASN'T GOT A GODDAMN CLUE WHAT'S WAITING FOR HER. I I I (APRIL MOANING) (MOANING CONTINUES) OH, HARRISON! WE HAVE TO STOP. THIS REALLY HURTS. JUST BE QUIET. IT'LL GET BETTER, I PROMISE. (GRUNTING) OH, I JUST-- CAN YOU JUST HOLD MY HAND? THIS REALLY HURTS. SHUT UP. I NEED TO FOCUS. OKAY. OH, OKAY, I'M GONNA SPLIT IN HALF, WE HAVE TO STOP. HERE. (GRUNTING) ow! HOW'S THIS? HOW'S THAT, HUH? OH, OH! HARRISON, WHAT ARE YOU-- OW! WHAT ARE YOU-- OW, THIS IS WORSE! GET OFF ME! OW, SERIOUSLY, GET, GET, GET OFF! WHAT? WHAT?! WHAT IS IT? (GASPING) YOU WEREN'T EVEN LISTENING TO ANYTHING I WAS SAYING. YOU WERE HURTING ME! THAT'S HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE. IT HURTS AT FIRST AND THEN IT GETS BETTER! STOP YELLING AT ME! YOU KNOW, FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS THE SAME EXPERIENCE AS ME, YOU CERTAINLY KNOW A LOT ABOUT THIS. WHAT? WHAT? I CAN STILL KNOW ABOUT THIS STUFF. JESUS CHRIST, IT'S OUR WEDDING NIGHT. I WANT IT TO BE SPECIAL. AND IT CAN BE SPECIAL. I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE RIPPED IN HALF ON THE FIRST NIGHT. YOU WEREN'T LISTENING TO ANYTHING I WAS SAYING. I TOLD YOU TO SLOW DOWN, YOU SPED UP. I TOLD YOU TO STOP, YOU WENT FASTER. IT WAS UNBEARABLE. APRIL, I DON'T KNOW IF, MMM... I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS FOR US. WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU-- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? I'M SAYING THAT I WANT TO BE ABLE TO FUCK MY WIFE ON MY WEDDING NIGHT WITHOUT HEARING HER NAGGING BULLSHIT ABOUT, "OH, IT HURTS, STOP, IT HURTS, STOP IT, STOP IT!" I MEAN, JESUS CHRIST, I OWN YOU. OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, NOBODY OWNS ME! WE ARE AN ENTITY TOGETHER. SECOND OF ALL, THIS IS MY FIRST TIME AND I WANTED IT TO BE SPECIAL. OH, DON'T GIVE ME THAT SENTIMENTAL BULLSHIT. A WIFE'S ONLY OBLIGATION IS TO PLEASE HER HUSBAND WHENEVER HE SEES FIT, THAT'S IT! AND A HUSBAND IS SUPPOSED TO RESPECT HIS WIFE JUST THE SAME. WE'RE NOT LIVING IN THE DARK AGES, HARRISON. YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT! WE'RE NOT LIVING IN THE DARK AGES! THEN WHY DO YOU HAVE SUCH A DARK-AGE MENTALITY WHEN IT COMES TO SEX? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? DO I HAVE TO SPELL EVERY FUCKING THING OUT FOR YOU? DO I? NO. WHY AREN'T WE FUCKING? HUH? WHY AREN'T WE FUCKING? WHY HAVEN'T YOU FUCKED ME YET? I MEAN, JESUS CHRIST, YOU'RE 283. YOU SHOULD BE FUCKING BY NOW! DAMN IT. FAITH IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME, HARRISON. AS MUCH AS IT IS TO YOU. WE MADE A PROMISE TOGETHER THAT WE BOTH KEPT. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT. OKAY? THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN WORK AT. IT'S A CHALLENGE, BUT GOD CHALLENGES US EVERY DAY BECAUSE HE WANTS TO SEE US GROW BECAUSE HE LOVES US. OKAY? I CAN'T BELIEVE WE DID THIS. ANY OF THIS. WE ARE TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PEOPLE. WHO ARE YOU? YOU CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT ME, CAN YOU? YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN THREE YEARS THAT I'VE KNOWN YOU THAT I AM ACTUALLY QUESTIONING YOUR SINCERITY ABOUT EVERYTHING. IT'S LIKE YOU'RE A DIFFERENT PERSON. WHAT IT IS, HARRISON? IS IT BECAUSE I CAN'T HANDLE MAKING LOVE? IS THAT IT? NO. IT'S EVERYTHING. THIS WAS A MISTAKE. IT'S NORMAL TO HAVE MIXED EMOTIONS. I MEAN, WE'RE MARRIED. THERE'S A LOT TO QUESTION. WE JUST HAVE TO CALM DOWN AND THINK THINGS THROUGH. WE DON'T HAVE TO SEE ANYTHING THROUGH, APRIL. I'M A MONSTER. DID YOU MARRY ME FOR MY MONEY? I MEAN, ALL THOSE TIMES THAT MY MOM WARNED ME. I KNOW IT'S HARSH, BUT YOU SNAPPING AT HER FOR THE MENTION OF A PRE-NUP? YOUR AMBIGUOUS ANSWERS WHEN IT ALWAYS CAME DOWN TO MONEY? GOD FORBID ME IF I'M WRONG AND I BETRAYED THE TRUST THAT I SHOULD HAVE FOR YOU. I PRAY WITH EVERY OUNCE OF MY BEING THAT I'M WRONG ABOUT THIS, BUT IF I'M NOT, HARRISON, YOU NEED TO TELL ME. NOT TOMORROW, NOT IN 10 MINUTES. NOW. PLEASE, HARRISON, JUST TELL ME. YOU OWE ME THAT. DID YOU MARRY ME FOR MY MONEY? YES. (SOBBING) OH, MY... OH. HARRISON. I JUST WANT YOU TO GO. PLEASE LEAVE, HARRISON! JUST GO! I POISONED MY LIFE. I'M NOT REALLY UPSET ABOUT THAT. I'M JUST SAD THAT I TOOK YOU WITH ME. YOU DIDN'T POISON ME, HARRISON. YOU JUST MADE ME SEE THE WORLD CLEARER, THAT THERE ARE EVILS OUT THERE THAT I COULDN'T EVEN IMAGINE. TO HAVE FAITH WITH ME... HOW CLICHE, THOUGH. THE EVIL MISOGYNIST GROWS A CONSCIENCE AFTER COMPLETELY CORRUPTING AND USING THE VIRGINAL GIRL. JUST GO, HARRISON. I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN. (RING CLATTERING) (SOBBING) WHO AM 1? FUCKING A. WHO ARE YOU? (LAUGHING) YOU'RE A GUY THAT'S ABOUT TO GET FUCKED UP WITH ME IN CELEBRATION-- THAT'S WHO YOU ARE. UNLESS YOU DON'T HAVE THE ENERGY LEFT IN YOUR BALLS. JESUS CHRIST, HARRISON, WHAT HAPPENED, MAN? YOU LOOK LIKE SHIT. COME ON, HOW'D IT GO, HUH? DID YOU GET INTO IT, MAN? DID YOU FUCKING TEAR THAT SHIT UP? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? WHAT AM I DOING HERE? I CAME BY TO TELL YOU I QUIT SMOKING. WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK I'M DOING HERE? I WANT TO KNOW HOW IT WENT. YOU DIDN'T INVITE ME TO THE WEDDING, SO I THOUGHT I'D CRASH YOUR NIGHT. (LAUGHING) DUDE, I'M JUST KIDDING. CHRIST. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU SAW A DEATH OR SOMETHING. WHAT HAPPENED? I FUCKED UP, TREVOR. (EXHALING) WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU FUCKED UP? HOW DID YOU FUCK UP? HUH? THREE YEARS. THREE-PLUS YEARS, AND IT TOOK ME THIS LONG TO REALIZE IT. THREE YEARS. YOU BETTER START MAKING SOME SENSE HERE. THREE YEARS FOR WHAT? THREE YEARS OF BEING WITH APRIL? HOW DID YOU FUCK IT UP? NO. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT APRIL. THEN WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU. FUCK. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME. THREE FULL YEARS OF BEING SPOON-FED THE MOST LUDICROUS MINDFUCKING BULLSHIT THAT I HAVE EVER HEARD. I DRANK THAT SHIT UP, AND YOU POISONED ME. YOU POISONED ME. I WAS NAIVE AND I WAS HORNY, AND I DRANK THAT SHIT UP, AND FOR WHAT? TO IMPRESS YOU? IS THAT IT? SHUT UP. SHUT UP AND LISTEN TO ME. NO, YOU LISTEN TO ME! I HAVE SAT THERE AND LISTENED TO EVERY BULLSHIT LECTURE AND SEMINAR AND STUPID FUCKING SPEECH THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN OVER THE YEARS. I HAVE WATCHED YOU DO EVERYTHING. I HAVE SEEN YOU SODOMIZE AND MANIPULATE NAIVE MEN SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE THE CONTROL, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU CONTROLLING WOMEN. IT'S ABOUT YOU CONTROLLING EVERYONE. I MEAN, GOD DAMN, I AM SO FUCKING STUPID THAT I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT, THAT IT TOOK ME-- IT TOOK ME SEEING SOMEONE THAT I COMPLETELY CORRUPTED FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT. I AM SCUM, BUT I AM NOTHING LIKE YOU, BECAUSE I MAY HAVE FUCKED HUNDREDS OF WOMEN. I MAY HAVE-- I MAY HAVE GOTTEN CRABS FROM YOUR BITCH CHERYL. I MAY HAVE EVEN VIOLATED EVERYTHING THAT IS MORAL, BUT SEEING THAT GIRL TEAR UP, SEEING HER TEAR UP, THAT WAS THE ICING ON THE CAKE. FOR WHAT? FOR THE INHERITANCE? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT HER FOR? FOR THE MONEY, FOR HER MOM'S MONEY? IS THAT IT? YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE SITUATION. I KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THE SITUATION! I CREATED THE SITUATION! YOU DO NOT HAVE PERMISSION TO GROW A CONSCIENCE RIGHT NOW. OH, WHY, 'CAUSE YOU'RE THE FUCKING BOSS OF ME? HUH? IS THAT IT? YOU'RE THE BOSS OF ME? YOU BETTER KEEP YOUR WORDS CLOSE TO YOUR VEST IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU FUCKED THIS UP FOR ME. FOR YOU? FOR YOU? WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU GET OUT OF THIS EXCEPT THE PLEASURE OF SEEING ANOTHER INNOCENT GIRL CORRUPTED? I HAVE EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THIS, YOU BACKSTABBING LITTLE SHIT! HOW DO YOU THINK HER MOM GOT ALL THAT MONEY, HUH? I HAD IT ALL PUT TOGETHER. ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS GRAB IT. WHY DO YOU THINK I INVESTED SO MUCH TIME MAKING YOU A POWERFUL, APATHETIC MACHINE? I MIGHT BE A FUCKING MACHINE, BUT THIS MACHINE HAS A LITTLE BIT OF FUCKING HEART. THAT'S WAY MORE THAN YOU HAVE. WHY? WHY NOW? WE HAD THIS! FUCK! WHY DO YOU WANT THIS, TREVOR? WHY ARE YOU EVEN FUCKING HERE? WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO-- WHAT IF I WASN'T ALWAYS LIKE THIS? HUH? WHAT IF THERE WAS ANOTHER TREVOR IN A PAST LIFE WHO WAS SUCCESSFUL AND CHARMING AND HAD IT ALL TAKEN AWAY BY SOME FUCKING BITCH WHO SOUGHT TO BRING ME DOWN FINANCIALLY, EMOTIONALLY, EVERY WHICH WAY? AND WHAT IF THAT TREVOR HAD TO GO INTO HIDING, HUH? LICK HIS WOUNDS, AND COME BACK A RESURRECTED BEING WITH A PROFOUND IDEOLOGY AND A PROMISE THAT HE WOULD MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN TO MAKE SURE HE NEVER HAD TO GO THROUGH WHAT HE ENDURED BEFORE-- OR ANY OTHER GUY I COULD SAVE. WELL, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT. EVERYBODY HAS THEIR DEMONS, INCLUDING YOU. I JUST HOPE FOR YOUR SAKE, YOU FUCKED THAT LITTLE CUNT GOOD. I HOPE YOU GAVE HER SO MUCH PAIN, EVERYBODY IN YOUR IMMEDIATE FAMILY COULD FEEL IT. GOD DAMN IT! (LAUGHING) OH! (LAUGHING) COME ON. YOU FUCK. WE ALWAYS DO THIS FOR PRETEND. LET'S DO IT FOR FUCKING REAL. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH MONEY YOU FUCKING COST ME, YOU LITTLE SHIT? REALLY? A KNIFE? THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GONNA USE? GOOD POINT. COME ON! (GRUNTING) (LAUGHING) (GROANING) DO YOU WANT TO SUCK MY COCK, LITTLE GIRL? COME ON. (LAUGHING) YOU LITTLE BITCH. (GRUNTING) (LAUGHING) (COUGHING) (LAUGHING) COME ON, BITCH. (PANTING) (GRUNTING) UHH! GOD DAMN IT. (GRUNTING) (CHOKING) STOP! (CHOKING) FUCK. UHH! GOD DAMN IT. SHIT. UHH! (GUNSHOT) (COUGHING) (COUGHING) (PANTING) SHIT. STOP! DON'T MOVE. I'M SERIOUS. OKAY. OKAY, LOOK. WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS, OKAY? SURE. WHAT THIS GENTLEMAN GOT, HE DESERVED, OKAY? I'M JUST A GUY IN THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME. WHO ARE YOU? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? WHAT WAS HE SAYING? I-- I KNEW-- I KNEW HARRISON. WELL, I-- I DIDN'T KNOW HIM. HE WAS AN ACQUAINTANCE. |-- I COULDN'T MAKE THE WEDDING. I WANTED TO WISH-- AT NIGHT? HERE? BULLSHIT! I OVERHEARD YOUR CONVERSATION. WHY WAS HE TRYING TO KILL YOU? OKAY, MISS, GUNS MAKE ME REALLY NERVOUS, OKAY? HE WAS THE BAD GUY. HE TRIED TO KILL ME FOR NO REASON. YOU SAW THAT. WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS, OKAY, HONEY? WHO ARE YOU? LOOK, IF YOU WOULD-- IF YOU WOULD JUST PUT THE GUN DOWN, WE'LL JUST-- WE'LL HAVE WORDS, BUT JUST... GET IT OUT OF MY FUCKING FACE. JUST PUT THE FUCKING GUN DOWN, YOU LITTLE CUNT! HOW'S THIS? AH, FUCK. OKAY, LOOK, WE-- WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS, HONEY. I WAS NEVER HERE, OKAY? HONEST, I DON'T KNOW YOU. LOOK AT ME. FUCK. YOU DON'T KNOW ME. I SAID, FUCKING LOOK AT ME! DAD?
