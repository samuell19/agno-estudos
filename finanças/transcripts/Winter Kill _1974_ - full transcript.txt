[GIRL] IT WILL BE HARD, BUT WHO ELSE CAN I GO TO BUT ELAINE? SHE'S OLDER, MARRIED, AND KNOWS MORE ABOUT LIFE. AND SHE KNOWS HIM. I NEED HER ADVICE, HER HELP. I KNOW SHE'LL UNDERSTAND. CYNTHIA, YOU COULDN'T HAVE BEEN THAT FOOLISH. THAT WAS DOWNRIGHT DUMB. YOU DON'T TRY TO TRAP A GUY INTO MARRIAGE BY DELIBERATELY GETTING PREGNANT. I WASN'T TRYING TO TRAP HIM. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN LATELY? THIS IS THE AGE OF LIBERATION. SEXUAL BLACKMAIL WENT OUT WITH THE PILL. BUT IT WASN'T BLACKMAIL. IT WAS LOVE. WITH DAVE MICHAELS? CYNTHIA, HE IS AN ATHLETE, A BEDROOM PRO. HE ONLY CARES ABOUT A SCORE. LOOK. EVEN IF YOU DID GET HIM, YOU WOULDN'T LIKE TO LIVE WITH HIM. OH, CYNTHIA, IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD. THERE'S AN ABORTION CLINIC IN LANCASTER, AND IT'S PERFECTLY LEGAL. ELAINE... THAT'S NOT THE POINT. I LOVE HIM. WELL, OBVIOUSLY, HE DOESN'T LOVE YOU. EAGLE ONE TO EAGLE CENTRAL. COME IN, PLEASE. EAGLE ONE TO EAGLE CENTRAL. COME IN, EAGLE CENTRAL. I--I REALLY-- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT, BUT-- DORIS! HOLD ON A MINUTE, MRS. YOUNG. I'VE GOT YOU, SAM. I'LL BE BACK IN HALF A MINUTE. I'LL GET HIM RIGHT ON OVER THERE. NOW DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING. DORIS! JUST WAIT RIGHT OUTSIDE. COME IN, DORIS! I'M BACK, SAM. O.K., DORIS. I'M OUT ON 126. SOMEBODY SPRAY-PAINTED OUR EAGLE LAKE SIGN. SAM, SOMETHING REALLY TERRIBLE HAS HAPPENED. WHAT? WELL, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT, NOT IN EAGLE LAKE. THAT WAS MILDRED YOUNG. SHE LIVES BY MRS. WILLIAM CARTER. I KNOW. WHAT'S HAPPENED? SOMEBODY SHOT HER. MRS. YOUNG? MRS. CARTER. MILDRED YOUNG FOUND HER THIS MORNING. DEAD? YES. DOES MRS. YOUNG KNOW WHO MIGHT HAVE DONE IT? WELL, NO. WHERE'S BILL CARTER? OH, I FORGOT TO ASK. NEVER MIND, DORIS. I'M ON MY WAY. FIND JERRY TROY. CALL DOC HAMMOND. ALERT OFFICERS CARLSON AND MANUALS. SHOULD I CALL THE MORTUARY? WE'LL WAIT FOR BILL CARTER. MORNING, SAM. MORNING, MILDRED. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH. DOWNSTAIRS. WHEN DID YOU COME OVER HERE, MILDRED? JUST A FEW MINUTES BEFORE I CALLED YOU. HOW DID YOU KNOW ABOUT IT? ABOUT 5:00 THIS MORNING, I WAS GETTING PIES READY FOR THE OVEN. YOU SURE GET UP EARLY. AT MY AGE, YOU DON'T WAIT TO GET UP FOR FEAR YOU WON'T MAKE IT. I PUT THEM IN THE OVEN AT EXACTLY 5:30. THEN I TURNED ON THE NEWS AND WENT TO WASH MY TEETH. THAT'S WHEN I HEARD IT. JUST ONE SHOT. WITH A COUPLE OF ECHOES MAYBE. IT WASN'T A CAR BACKFIRING. MY JAKE PULLED THE TRIGGER ON ENOUGH SHOTGUNS FOR ME TO KNOW WHAT THEY SOUND LIKE. I STEPPED OUT ON MY PORCH TO FIGURE OUT WHAT DIRECTION IT MIGHT HAVE COME FROM. DID YOU SEE ANYTHING? ONLY THE TREES AND SNOW, BUT I HEARD SOMETHING-- A CAR WAY UP THERE BY THE HIGHWAY, MOVING SLOW AND SOFT AS IF IT DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE ANY ATTENTION. AND THEY WENT ON TOWARD TOWN, OR AT ANY RATE, TOWARD THE LOCKHARD PLACE, WHICH IS BETWEEN HERE AND THERE. UH-HUH. THEN WHAT? WELL, THEN I CAME BACK IN, CHECKED MY PIES, AND THEN I SAT DOWN, LISTENED TO THE NEWS, WAITING FOR A DECENT HOUR TO COME OVER AND ASK ELAINE IF SHE'D HEARD IT. THEY DIDN'T ANSWER THE DOOR, SO I TOOK A MOSEY AROUND. WHEN I SAW THE HOLE IN THE BEDROOM WINDOW, I KNEW I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO WASTE, SO I LET MYSELF IN. DO YOU HAVE A KEY? NO, BUT THEY KEEP ONE UNDER THE PORCH RAILING. I WENT DOWN TO THE BEDROOM AND FOUND HER, POOR THING. UH, WHERE'S BILL CARTER? HE ISN'T HERE. HIS CAR'S GONE. OH. MILDRED, THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP. IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE I CAN DO, JUST LET ME KNOW. HI, DOC. THERE'S SOMETHING REALLY WEIRD. SOMEBODY TOOK A SPRAY CAN AND WROTE "THE FIRST" IN THE SNOW. THE FIRST? I SURE DON'T LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT. THAT COULD BE SOME NUT FROM THE OUTSIDE. I DON'T KNOW. EVER HEARD OF A CRIME OF PASSION? STRANGERS AREN'T PASSIONATE ABOUT OTHER STRANGERS. [SIREN] [TURNS OFF SIREN] I'M HERE, SIR. I KNOW. GET YOUR CAMERA. TAKE THE BEDROOM, THE VICTIM, THE BROKEN WINDOW, THE FOOTPRINTS, AND THE WRITING IN THE SNOW. WRITING IN THE SNOW? IT'LL EXPLAIN ITSELF. WELL... OH, YES, SIR. JERRY. YES, SIR? YOU'RE OUT OF THE ARMY, SO JUST CALL ME SAM. YES, SIR. HAVE YOU REACHED BILL CARTER? HOW DO YOU KNOW HE WASN'T HERE? HE STOPPED BY YESTERDAY, SAID HE WAS GOING TO L.A. THEY NEEDED SOME TRANQUILIZERS. ANY IDEA WHERE HE STAYS? YEAH. THE CENTURY CANYON HOTEL, USUALLY. BILL CARTER MADE A RESERVATION AT THE HOTEL, BUT HE NEVER SHOWED UP. IS IT ALL RIGHT IF I GO OUTSIDE? SURE. THE AIR WILL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER. TAKE PICTURES OF THE SPRAY PAINTING. YES, SIR. I'VE ALREADY SENT FOR THE AMBULANCE. I'LL BE AT THE OFFICE. THANKS, GIL. WELL, I SEE YOU GOT YOUR COLOR BACK. SORRY. DON'T BE SORRY. SHOWS YOU HAVE FEELINGS. AIR PERKED ME UP. IT'LL DO IT. DID YOU GET PICTURES? YEAH. TAKE THEM OVER TO MONAHAN'S. TELL HIM WE NEED PRINTS RIGHT AWAY. GET BILL'S DESCRIPTION, CAR MAKE, COLOR, PLATE NUMBER TO THE L.A. POLICE AND THE HIGHWAY PATROL. TELL THEM TO PUT OUT AN ALL-POINTS. THEN SUPERVISE THE BODY'S REMOVAL. PETER. GOOD MORNING, SAM. WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE CARTER HOUSE? YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO USE BINOCULARS. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? FROM THE WINDOW UP THERE. OH. WELL, THAT WAS PROBABLY GRACE. SHE'S UP TO HER EARS IN AUDUBON. SOMEBODY BREAK IN? WITH A SHOTGUN. WHAT? ELAINE CARTER'S BEEN KILLED. OH, NO. I KNEW SHE WAS ALONE, BUT-- HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT? I WAS AWARE THAT BILL CARTER WAS GONE. YEAH? SHOULDN'T I BE? HE STOPPED IN YESTERDAY AND ASKED ME TO DO A TITLE SEARCH. HE MENTIONED HE WAS GOING TO LOS ANGELES. GIL HAMMOND TOLD ME THAT. THERE'S NOTHING SINISTER ABOUT THAT, IS THERE, SAM? I DON'T KNOW. ALL RIGHT, PETER. YOU CAN BRING DOWN MY LUGGAGE NOW. YES, GRACE. RIGHT AWAY. WELL, GOOD MORNING, CHIEF McNEAL. MRS. LOCKHARD. HAS SOMETHING HAPPENED? DID YOU SEE ANYTHING THROUGH YOUR BINOCULARS? OH, BIRDS, MR. McNEAL. PURPLE FINCH, CHICKADEES, FOX SPARROWS. OH, BE CAREFUL WITH THAT MAKE-UP CASE, PETER. WELL, WHY DON'T WE STOP FENCING? WHAT'S THE BAD NEWS? HOW'D YOU KNOW IT WAS BAD? I CAN REASON. BESIDES, I HEARD YOU TELL PETER. DO YOU HAVE A REPORT ON THE HIGHWAY CONDITIONS? I'M CATCHING A PLANE. DOESN'T IT BOTHER YOU? IF IT DID, I WOULDN'T GO. I'M TALKING ABOUT ELAINE. YOU MUST THINK I'M COMPLETELY INSENSITIVE. IT'S JUST THAT WE WERE NOT... PARTICULARLY FRIENDLY, THAT'S ALL. YEAH? NOT THAT IT'S ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS, BUT I DIDN'T CARE FOR HER LIFE STYLE. WHEN YOU PUT THE LUGGAGE IN THE TRUNK, TRY NOT TO SCRATCH THE LEATHER. IS THE INTERROGATION OVER? WHILE YOU WERE BIRD-WATCHING, DID YOU SEE ANYTHING THAT MIGHT HELP US? OR DID EITHER OF YOU HEAR A GUNSHOT OR SEE ANYTHING ABOUT 5:45 THIS MORNING? I DON'T SEE WHY EITHER OF US-- I'M A VERY SOUND SLEEPER. PETER... IS A SOUND SLEEPER, TOO. RIGHT, PETER? YEAH. NOW, BE SURE TO TURN OFF THE LIGHTS WHEN YOU'RE NOT USING THEM. DON'T FORGET TO LOCK THE FRONT DOOR. GRACE... I'LL REMEMBER. YOU WON'T IF I DON'T REMIND YOU. I'VE GOT TO HURRY NOW. HURRY BACK, DARLING. I'LL MISS YOU. OF COURSE YOU WILL. HAVE YOU DISCOVERED WHO THE MURDERER IS YET? NO. OH. WELL, DON'T WORRY. YOU WILL. THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE A POLICEMAN FOR. BE SURE TO DRESS WARMLY. I WILL. MY WIFE LIKES TO CONCENTRATE ON THE MATTERS IMMEDIATELY AT HAND. I COULD TELL. I MIGHT WANT TO TALK TO YOU LATER. I'LL BE IN MY OFFICE. IF YOU THINK OF ANYTHING, WELL, LET ME KNOW. I NEED A LITTLE GAS, GEORGE. HEY, SAM. HELLO, CLINT. WHAT WILL WE DO ABOUT THIS MESS-- THE SPRAY PAINTING, THE SENSATIONALISM? THE FIRST THING IS TO FEEL SORRY FOR THE VICTIM. WELL, OF COURSE. WE ALL DO. THEN YOU FIND THE MURDERER AND LET JUSTICE TAKE ITS COURSE. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, SAM. IT'S WINTER CARNIVAL TIME, OUR BIGGEST FINANCIAL SEASON. THAT'S WHAT MY JOB IS ALL ABOUT. WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT? COULDN'T YOU PLAY IT DOWN, KEEP IT OUT OF THE PAPERS? I COULD TAKE THE BODY DOWN THE BACK ROAD. INTIMATE IT WAS SUICIDE. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, CLINT. WE'LL HANDLE IT REAL POLITE, LIKE IT WERE YOUR OWN MURDER. SAM, I'M A 47-YEAR-OLD TOWN MANAGER WITH NO PLACE TO GO UNLESS THEY REAPPOINT ME. NEXT SPRING, AT THE TOWN MEETING, THEY'LL JUDGE ME ON THE BUDGET ONLY. THIS BUSINESS OF ELAINE CARTER WILL BE LONG FORGOTTEN. NOT BY ME. CLINT CATCH UP WITH YOU? YEAH. IT HASN'T BEEN MY BEST MORNING. THERE'S STILL NO RESPONSE ON THAT APB ON MR. CARTER. I HOPE IT DOESN'T MAKE HIM FEEL LIKE A CRIMINAL. DIDN'T JERRY TELL THEM BILL WASN'T WANTED FOR THE CRIME? NO, HE FORGOT. I CLEARED IT UP. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'D DO WITHOUT YOU, DORIS. HE'LL GET USED TO THE JOB. WHO WILL? HI, CHARLIE. YOU GOT YOUR HANDS FULL WITH ELAINE CARTER. WHAT YOU GOING TO DO? I WISH HARVEY WOULD STOP REVVING THAT ENGINE. SHE FINALLY PLAYED AROUND WITH THE WRONG MAN. I'D LOOK FOR A JEALOUS WOMAN. IT'S NOT A WOMAN'S CRIME, CHARLIE. WHY NOT? SHOTGUNS AND SNOW BOOTS, WANDERING IN THE WOODS AT DAWN. EVER HEAR OF ANNIE OAKLEY? YEAH. WELL? LETTER FROM YOUR SISTER IN BOULDER. I GOT THAT ENGINE TUNED TO SUCH A DELICATE PITCH, I CAN'T DECIDE WHETHER TO PUT IT IN THE INDIANAPOLIS 500 OR THE SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY. DID I GET ANYTHING, CHARLIE? NOTHING MUCH, HARVEY. BOOK CLUB NEWS, MOSTLY. HEY, SAM. I WAS THINKING. MAYBE SOMEBODY WAS AFTER MR. CARTER, MADE A MISTAKE. WHY WOULD ANYBODY BE AFTER HIM? WELL, THERE'S CONSIDERABLE FEELING THAT HIS PREFAB MOBILE HOME DEVELOPMENT IS A BLIGHT ON THE LAND. MAYBE SOMEBODY TOOK AFTER HIM. COULD BE. YOU KNOW THAT NOVEL I'M WRITING-- I GOT A CHARACTER A LOT LIKE ELAINE. I'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT THAT NOVEL FOR THREE YEARS. I'D LIKE TO READ IT. THE PURPOSE OF WRITING IT IS TO SELL IT, NOT GIVE IT AWAY. ANYWAY, THIS WOMAN-- FRANCINE-- SHE HAS A LOVE AFFAIR WITH A GOLF PRO. IT'S ONE OF HER MANY, AND IT GETS TOO SERIOUS. HOW DOES IT COME OUT? WELL, FRANCINE REALLY IS ELAINE, AND THE GOLF PRO IS A SKIING INSTRUCTOR. WHICH ONE? DAVE MICHAELS. DIDN'T YOU KNOW? THAT WAS OVER A LONG TIME AGO. I HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN ELAINE CARTER IN OVER A MONTH. I'M AS SHOCKED AS ANYBODY AT HER DEATH. WHO CALLED IT OFF? I DID. SHE BECAME TOO POSSESSIVE. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT MARRIED WOMEN. THEY'RE SELFISH, SPOILED BRATS. DAVE! DAVE, HURRY UP! WE'RE GETTING COLD. I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU, DIANE. LOOK, SAM. I DIDN'T KILL HER. I HAD NO REASON TO. IF ANYBODY WAS MAD, IT WAS HER AT ME. DID HER HUSBAND KNOW ABOUT YOU? YEAH. SURE, HE DID, AND WE HAD A FEW WORDS. HE KNEW HE COULDN'T TAKE ME ON. AFTER IT WAS OVER, WE GOT TO BE GOOD FRIENDS. HE SHOULD HAVE JUST KICKED HER TAIL. WHAT WAS RIGHT FOR YOU WAS WRONG FOR HER? NOW, I WASN'T MARRIED. I HAVEN'T TAKEN AN OATH TO BE FAITHFUL TO ANYBODY. I'M JUST DOOMED TO PLAY THE FIELD. I'LL PROBABLY END UP A LONESOME, BUT ENVIED OLD MAN. DAVE, WE'RE GETTING COLD! FOOLISH TO WASTE SOMETHING LIKE THAT, HUH, SAM? YEAH, I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD AGREE WITH YOU. SOMETIME WHEN YOU'RE OFF-DUTY, STOP OVER AT MY PLACE, AND I'LL SET YOU UP. EAGLE CENTRAL TO EAGLE ONE. EAGLE ONE. WHAT IS IT, DORIS? MR. CARTER'S BACK, SAM. THE HIGHWAY PATROL STOPPED HIM. HE WANTS TO SEE YOU. WHERE? AT HIS HOUSE. PETER LOCKHARD CALLED AND SAID HE JUST REMEMBERED THERE WAS A GIRL WHO LIVED WITH THE CARTERS BEFORE. THANKS, DORIS. SEE IF DOC HAMMOND CAN COME OUT TO THE CARTERS'. I'VE ALREADY TALKED WITH HER MOTHER. SHE WANTS THE SERVICES TO BE HELD IN RIVERSIDE, WHERE WE WERE MARRIED. AND THE BURIAL WILL BE AT... THE FAMILY PLOT AT WOODBINE. YES. THAT'S ALL RIGHT WITH ME. NO. A MAHOGANY COFFIN. AND FLOWERS. SHE LOVED FLOWERS. YELLOW TEA ROSES. ALL RIGHT. IF YOU HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS, I'LL BE HERE. HELLO, BILL. SHE NEVER HURT ANYBODY IN HER WHOLE LIFE, SAM... EXCEPT MAYBE ME ONCE IN A WHILE. SHE GAVE EVERYTHING SHE HAD. SHE...YOU KNOW, SHE TOOK IN STRAY CATS, DOGS, PEOPLE. AND THAT PAINTING IN THE SNOW-- "THE FIRST." WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? I DON'T KNOW. SHE WOULDN'T EVEN KILL A SPIDER. SHE'D TAKE IT OUTSIDE FIRST. WELL... WHERE DO WE START, BILL? THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE TO BE ASKED. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING YET? THE SIGN, SHOTGUN SHELLS, BOOT TRACKS, TIME OF DAY, SOUND OF A CAR. WELL, THAT'S NOT MUCH. NO. WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOW UP AT THE CENTURY CANYON HOTEL YESTERDAY? WELL, IT SURE DIDN'T TAKE YOU MUCH TIME TO GET ON MY TRAIL, DID IT? I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU. I JUST CHANGED MY MIND AND STAYED IN A MOTEL. I'LL NEED THE NAME AND ADDRESS. SURE. CHARGE SLIP'S IN THE CAR. STAY ALL NIGHT? OF COURSE I DID. YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD. I LEFT BEFORE ANYBODY WAS UP. IS THAT A SHOTGUN MISSING FROM THE RACK UPSTAIRS? YEAH. BOY, YOU SURE DON'T MISS A THING, DO YOU? HASN'T BEEN GONE LONG. YOU CAN TELL FROM THE DUST RING. WHERE IS IT? BOTTOM OF THE LAKE. HOW DID IT GET THERE? I THREW IT THERE AFTER I MISSED MY THIRD DUCK WITH IT ABOUT A WEEK AGO. IT'S PROBABLY BURIED UNDER 10 FEET OF MUD. DID ANYBODY LIVE WITH YOU AND ELAINE RECENTLY? NOBODY. NOT A GIRL? NAH. OH, YEAH. YES. THERE'S MRS. HOWE'S DAUGHTER. THAT WAS ABOUT A YEAR AGO. WHY? SOMEBODY MENTIONED IT. MRS. HOWE? SHE USED TO KEEP HOUSE FOR US HERE. LIVED ACROSS THE LAKE. SHE WAS A WIDOW. SHE DIED. TYPICALLY, ELAINE TOOK THE DAUGHTER IN UNTIL SHE FINISHED SCHOOL. YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS NOW? NO. L.A., I SUPPOSE. I DON'T KNOW. WE LOST TOUCH. WHAT'S HER NAME? CYNTHIA-- CYNTHIA HOWE. WELL, BILL, I'M SORRY. SAM, HOW'S HE DOING? NOT BAD, UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. DRINKING A LITTLE. YOU EVER KNOW A GIRL NAMED CYNTHIA HOWE? THE NAME SOUNDS FAMILIAR, BUT I CAN'T PUT A FACE WITH IT. I'LL CHECK MY RECORDS. BETTER FIND OUT WHAT DUCK BLIND BILL CARTER'S BEEN USING. GET SOME GUYS TO SEE IF THEY CAN FIND HIS GUN. YES, SIR. WHAT DID THEY SAY IS WRONG WITH YOUR CAR? POINTS, CONDENSER-- SOME KIND OF IGNITION PROBLEM. THEY DON'T KNOW. WELL, IT GIVES US A CHANCE TO RIDE TOGETHER. YES, SIR. I BELIEVE I HINTED I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO CALL ME SIR. FIVE YEARS OF MILITARY POLICE IS A HARD HABIT TO BREAK. YOU WERE A LIEUTENANT. IN A WORLD FULL OF CAPTAINS AND MAJORS. YOU ARE THE CHIEF OF POLICE. TO ME, THAT REPRESENTS A SIR. IN THE CITY, I MIGHT BE A GENERAL, BUT THIS IS JUST A SMALL TOWN. WHEN I FIRST GOT OUT OF THE SERVICE AND DECIDED TO BECOME A COP, I THOUGHT I'D START OUT IN A SMALL, QUIET TOWN. YOU PICKED THE WRONG TOWN AT THE WRONG TIME. HOW YOU LIKE YOUR PLACE? OH, IT'S FINE, SIR. GOOD. GOT A VIEW? YES, SIR. WHEN I LEAN WAY OUT OVER THE EDGE OF THE BALCONY, I SEE A TINY PIECE OF THE LAKE. I HOPE YOU LIKE IT WELL ENOUGH TO STAY. THANK YOU, SIR. WHAT DO YOU WEIGH? 190. 190--WHAT, ARE YOU ABOUT 6' 2"? 6' 2". IF WE EVER GET IN A POSITION WHERE WE HAVE TO FIGHT, YOU DO THE FIGHTING. YES, SIR. I HAVE TO TRY AGAIN. I'LL TELL DAVID WHAT ELAINE TOLD ME TO DO WITH HIS BABY. I HOPE HE'LL TALK ME OUT OF IT. I KNOW HE LOVES ME. HE TOLD ME SO. HE TOLD ME OVER AND OVER. HE SAID I WAS THE ONLY ONE HE EVER REALLY LOVED. PLEASE, GOD, MAKE HIM LOVE ME NOW. I DON'T HAVE ANYBODY ELSE, AND I'M SCARED. PLEASE HELP HIM UNDERSTAND I NEED HIM. I NEED HIM SO MUCH. CYNTHIA, HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU NOT TO COME OVER UNLESS YOU CALL FIRST. NOW, I'M BUSY! [GUNSHOT] DAVE WAS MOVING. WHOEVER HIT HIM IS SURE SOME SHOT. COULD SOMEBODY LIKE THAT MISS THREE DUCKS IN A ROW? HUH? NOTHING. I WAS JUST THINKING OUT LOUD. CHIEF! SIR! OVER HERE! BETTY! SAM. WELL? WELL, WHAT? AREN'T YOU GOING TO SAY ANYTHING? ABOUT WHAT? YOU DIDN'T COME BY LAST NIGHT, REMEMBER? OH, I'M SORRY. I FORGOT. OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I JUST HAD EVERYTHING SET UP FOR THE BIG PLAY-- MUSIC, DINNER, CANDLELIGHTS, FIREPLACE. WE WOULD HAVE BEEN A SMASH... EXCEPT FOR ONE THING-- MY LEADING MAN NEVER SHOWED. I WAS WORKING ON THE ELAINE CARTER BUSINESS. YEAH, YEAH. EXCUSE ACCEPTED. CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING? A HAMBURGER. ONIONS? NO. JERRY? CHEESEBURGER, PLEASE, AND COFFEE. I GOT EVERYTHING ON HOLD. WHAT TIME ARE YOU COMING BY TONIGHT? WELL, BETTY... SAM! I MEAN, WHAT IS IT? JUST TELL ME! DID I DO SOMETHING? NO. NO. DAVE MICHAELS WAS KILLED THIS MORNING. OH, NO. SHOT THE SAME WAY ELAINE CARTER WAS. SAM, WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND HERE? I MEAN, WHAT'S HAPPENING? OH, NO. I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE. EVIDENCE? I'M NOT SURE, ROGER. I JUST HAD A CALL FROM THE STATE EDITOR OF THE L.A. TIMES-- PERSONALLY, HIMSELF. THEY'RE CRYING FOR COPY, MORE THAN WE'RE FEEDING THE WIRE SERVICES. A FULL FEATURE-- PICTURES, COLOR, BACKGROUND. THE CONTRAST BETWEEN A SLEEPY LITTLE RESORT TOWN AND THE SUDDEN SHOCK OF VIOLENCE. [SAM] BLOOD IN THE SNOW, FEAR STALKING THE ONCE-QUIET STREETS. I'M GOING TO USE THAT. I HAVE THE FACTS AND SOME PICTURES. I NEED WHAT'S GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES AND HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS. CONFUSED, FRUSTRATED, MAD. IS THAT ALL? ROGER, I CAN'T DISCUSS IT PUBLICLY. JUST WRITE WE'RE WORKING HARD. I NEED MORE, SAM. THIS IS MY BEST CHANCE FOR A BY-LINE, MAYBE GET SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD. I'D LIKE TO HELP YOU. YOU WERE YOUNG ONCE. I WAS TILL A COUPLE DAYS AGO. WELL, SUPPOSE SOMEBODY HELPED YOU. YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL. ROGER... LISTEN--EXCUSE ME. [HORN HONKING] CLINT. SAM. WHAT'S BEN RAVITCH DOING HERE? I SENT FOR HIM. YOU SENT FOR HIM? YEAH. YOU DIDN'T WANT POLICE CRAWLING ALL OVER THE PLACE, IF YOU REMEMBER THE EAGLE LAKE IMAGE. THAT WAS BEFORE DAVE MICHAELS. THIS IS MASS MURDER. YOU'RE NOT EQUIPPED TO HANDLE IT. WHAT WILL HE DO? BRING IN MANPOWER. BRING IN 20 MEN-- 100, 200 MEN. THE KILLER'S GOING TO GO TO COVER, RETURN AFTER THEY'VE GONE. DO I UNDERSTAND YOU DON'T WANT HELP, SAM? NO. TWO PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED. I'LL TAKE HELP FROM THE DEVIL IF HE CAN GIVE ME ANY. BEN. SAM, YOU FINALLY HIT THE BIG TIME-- TWO MURDERS IN TWO DAYS. IT'S GOING REAL WELL. BEN, THANKS FOR COMING. SAM'S DONE EVERYTHING HUMANLY POSSIBLE TO SOLVE THIS, WE JUST NEED HELP. WOULDN'T YOU SAY SO, SAM? WHAT HAVE YOU GOT? ALL RIGHT, BEN. WE GOT PICTURES OF THE FIRST CRIME AND VICTIM. THE SECOND SHOULD BE HERE ANY MINUTE. PICTURES OF BOTH SPRAY PAINTINGS IN THE SNOW. PICTURES OF THE SNOW BOOT TRACKS, BOTH THE SAME SIZE. 2 SHOTGUN SHELLS-- 12-GAUGE, HIGH BASE. NO FINGERPRINTS OR REAL CLUES AS TO THE KILLER. I HAVE NO IDEA WHO'S DOING THIS. WHAT GOOD WILL IT DO TO HAVE BOTH OF US HERE WITH NO IDEA WHO'S DOING THIS? DIDN'T YOU SEND FOR ME? NO. HE DID. WELL, THE RIDE UP WAS NICE, ANYWAY. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? BACK DOWN THE HILL. I CAN'T DO ANYTHING HERE. IF I CAN HELP LATER, CALL ME, SAM. YOU'RE A STUBBORN MAN! I'VE GOT SOME STUFF IN MY CAR FROM DAVE MICHAELS' PLACE I'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH. HE SHOULD HAVE LET BICKFORD TAKE OVER. HE'D BE OFF THE HOOK. WOULD YOU LET SOMEBODY PUT OUT YOUR FIRE? SAM, I'M ON MY WAY TO THE FUNERAL. LET'S GET IT OVER WITH. YOU KNOW YOUR WIFE AND DAVE MICHAELS WERE FRIENDS ONCE. THAT'S WATER UNDER THE DAM. WELL, SINCE THEY WERE BOTH KILLED, THERE MIGHT BE SOME CONNECTION. WITH WHO? ME? YOU'RE STILL HUNG UP ON MY ALIBI AND THE GUN IN THE LAKE, AREN'T YOU? THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I COULD HAVE KILLED ELAINE AND DAVE, BUT I DIDN'T, AND I WOULDN'T NOW. ALL RIGHT. WOULD YOU SEE IF YOU KNOW WHO THIS PERSON IS IN THE PICTURE WITH DAVE MICHAELS? HOW WOULD I KNOW? YOUR WIFE'S IN THE PICTURE. THAT'S CYNTHIA-- THE GIRL WHO LIVED WITH US. YEAH. CYNTHIA HOWE. AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS NOW? I HAVEN'T SEEN HER IN OVER A YEAR. LOOK, SAM, I'M LATE. I'VE GOT TO GO. SAM! SAM, THEY NEVER LEARN, DO THEY? WHAT? COMING DOWN A NOSE-DIVE IS LIKE DRIVING A CAR AT 50 MILES AN HOUR WITHOUT STEERING WHEEL AND BRAKES. THEY THINK THEY KNOW, AND THEY DON'T KNOW. THAT BOY IS GOING TO BE SIX MONTHS IN A CAST WITH THAT HIP. I'VE GOT SOMETHING YOU MIGHT WANT TO SEE. WANT LUNCH? SURE. THANK YOU. I WAS LOOKING THROUGH THE HOSPITAL RECORDS LAST NIGHT, AND "HOWE, BERTA F., "DIED OF AN AORTAL ANEURYSM "2 1/2 YEARS AGO. "SURVIVED BY DAUGHTER CYNTHIA, HUSBAND UNLISTED," LEFT BLANK. ANYTHING ON CYNTHIA HOWE? CYNTHIA... YEAH, HERE IT IS. SHE WASN'T ONE OF MY PATIENTS, AND SHE HAD A DIFFERENT ADDRESS. I FOUND THIS IN DR. LITTLE'S FILES. HE LEFT THEM WHEN HE MOVED. HE TREATED HER ONCE. WELL, NOT TREATED HER. HE SAW HER. FOR WHAT? PREGNANCY TEST. WAS SHE? VERY. SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE BABY HERE. LOOK HERE. "FATHER OF CHILD-- DAVE MICHAELS." HOW ABOUT THAT? I THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE THAT. CYNTHIA LIVED WITH THE CARTERS, YOU KNOW. DID SHE? YEAH. MAYBE ELAINE CARTER TOOK DAVE AWAY FROM HER. MAYBE SHE WANTED REVENGE. MAYBE THE KILLER I'M LOOKING FOR IS A WOMAN. THAT'S AN AWFUL LOT OF MAYBES, SAM. YEAH. LOOK HERE. "MOTHER DECEASED. FATHER NONE." FATHER NONE? SHE HAD TO HAVE A FATHER. SHE COULD HAVE BEEN BORN OUT OF WEDLOCK. DIDN'T KNOW HIM. WHY NOT LEAVE IT BLANK OR PUT DOWN UNKNOWN? SHE PUT DOWN NONE. THAT COULD SHOW DISAPPOINTMENT OR ANGER. MAYBE. IF THESE MAYBES ADD UP, I BETTER FIND THAT FATHER. IF HE'S ALIVE, HE COULD BE THE THIRD. WELL, LET'S GO. I THINK THEY'RE HAVING FRANKS AND BEANS TODAY. HAVEN'T HAD THAT SINCE YESTERDAY. HA HA HA! NONE. AUGUST 23rd-- WE WERE ALL TIED UP IN SUCH AN EMOTIONAL KNOT. NOBODY ACTED NORMALLY, INCLUDING MYSELF. I THOUGHT MAYBE SOME THIRD PERSON, WISER THAN THE THREE OF US, COULD HELP UNTIE IT. I WENT TO SEE REVEREND PHILLIPS. HE HELPED MAMMA WHEN SHE WAS IN TROUBLE. HE PROMISED TO SPEAK TO DAVID AND TALK WITH ME TONIGHT. HE DENIES IT. HE MAINTAINS IT COULD HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF YOUNG MEN, INCLUDING MR. CARTER. IT'S NOT! THERE WAS NOBODY ELSE! THERE SHOULDN'T EVEN HAVE BEEN ONE. YOU CAN TAKE HIM TO COURT FOR A BLOOD MATCH-UP AFTER THE BABY COMES, OR HAVE THE BABY AND PUT IT UP FOR ADOPTION. HAVE IT GROW UP NOT KNOWING ITS PARENTS. I'LL DO WHAT I HAVE TO. TO ME, ABORTION IS MORALLY DISGRACEFUL. BUT IT'S LEGAL. ONLY UNDER TEMPORAL LAW, WHICH BENDS TO SOCIAL PRESSURE. BUT UNDER DIVINE LAW, IT'S MURDER! THAT MAY BE YOUR INTERPRETATION, BUT YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT, AND YOU'RE NOT A WOMAN! YOU CAME FOR MY ADVICE. WHY DON'T YOU TAKE IT? BECAUSE I CAN'T TAKE IT. I CAN'T TAKE IT AND LIVE WITH MYSELF. [SPRAY PAINTING] [GUNSHOT] [SIREN] OTHER SIDE! JERRY, HERE IT IS. SHE HAD AN APPOINTMENT WITH HIM. "AUGUST 23rd, 8 P.M., CYNTHIA HOWE." SHE'S THE KEY TO THE WHOLE THING. IF WE CAN JUST FIGURE IT OUT. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] YEAH! [KNOCKING] I'M ON MY WAY! COME IN, JERRY. YEAH, SAM. YOU KNOW WHAT-- GET ANY SLEEP? ABOUT TWO MINUTES IN THE SHOWER. CLINTON BICKFORD CALLED AN EMERGENCY MEETING OF THE TOWN COUNCIL. GOOD. IT'LL KEEP HIM OUT OF OUR WAY. IT'S NOT GOOD. THEY CALLED PETE LOCKHARD FOR LEGAL ADVICE ON WHETHER THEY CAN FIRE YOU. WELL, CAN THEY? CALL DORIS AND TELL HER I'LL BE LATE. EAGLE CENTRAL, THIS IS EAGLE ONE. COME IN, PLEASE. SAM, BEFORE YOU START SPOUTING RULE-BOOK CLICHES ABOUT LAW AND ORDER AND CITIZEN WITCH HUNTS, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT THIS TOWN COUNCIL SITS HERE AS ONE--UNITED. UNITED ABOUT WHAT, CLINT? HUNTING DOWN THAT KILLER. TELL ME WHO, AND I'LL GO. YOU'VE HAD YOUR CHANCE. YOU EVEN REFUSED THE SHERIFF'S HELP. THAT'S NOT TRUE, FRANK! WHAT DOES THIS GROUP OF VIGILANTES PROPOSE? WE JUST CAN'T SIT HERE DOING NOTHING, WATCHING YOU DO EVEN LESS. NOW, HOLD IT-- I'VE HAD OVER 20 PHONE CALLS FROM NEWSPAPERS, WIRE SERVICES ALL OVER THE STATE! THEY'RE CALLING THIS THE MURDER CAPITAL OF THE MOUNTAINS. OUR COMMERCIAL SEASON IS ALMOST HERE. CANCELLATIONS ARE POURING IN! WHAT WILL WE LIVE ON? LET'S KEEP CALM. PANIC WILL ONLY MAKE THINGS WORSE. I'M NOT QUALIFIED TO RUN THE GROCERY STORE, THE NEWSPAPER, THE DRUG STORE ANY MORE THAN YOU'RE QUALIFIED TO RUN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. WHY DON'T YOU-- JUST SIT BACK AND WONDER WHO'S NEXT? HOW MANY MORE BODIES DO YOU NEED? YOU'RE THE SECOND-HIGHEST- PAID OFFICIAL IN THIS TOWN. FOR ISSUING PARKING TICKETS! COMES DOWN TO THIS-- WE HIRED YOU. WE CAN FIRE YOU. TEAR UP MY CONTRACT AND KEEP MY SALARY. I'LL WORK FOR NOTHING. WHETHER YOU BELIEVE IT, I'M MORE FRUSTRATED THAN ALL OF YOU! BUT I'LL NOT RUN SCREAMING DOWN MAIN STREET FOR YOU. I'LL NOT ALLOW ANY AMATEUR POLICEMAN TO TAKE THE LAW IN HIS OWN HANDS. IF YOU TRY, I'LL SQUASH YOU. I'M SORRY, SAM. I DON'T HAVE THE TIME NOR ENERGY TO LOSE MY TEMPER THAT WAY. IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO? OH, THAT GIRL WHO LIVED WITH THE CARTERS-- NAME WAS CYNTHIA HOWE. CAN YOU TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT HER? NO. WHY? EVERYBODY KILLED SEEMED TO KNOW HER. THERE'S SOME CONNECTION. GRACE MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING. ASK HER WHEN SHE COMES BACK. I'LL DO BETTER THAN THAT. IT'LL GIVE ME AN EXCUSE TO CALL HER. YOU THINK I HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO THAN SPY ON A CLEANING WOMAN'S DAUGHTER? I PROMISED SAM I'D ASK YOU. NOW YOU'VE DONE YOUR NEIGHBORLY DUTY. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT? I WANT TO KNOW WHEN YOU'RE COMING HOME. WHY? WELL, I MISS YOU. PETER, WE'VE BEEN MISSING EACH OTHER FOR YEARS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WANT ME TO SPELL IT OUT? YEAH. I WASN'T GOING TO DISCUSS THIS ON THE PHONE, BUT SINCE YOU FORCED ME-- I WENT TO SEE A LAWYER TODAY. WHAT FOR? WELL, I'M COMING HOME, AND I'M GOING TO START PACKING. GRACE, YOU CAN'T. I LOVE YOU. WHO ARE YOU KIDDING? YOU MARRIED ME FOR MONEY. NO! I TOLD YOU, I DON'T WANT TO DISCUSS IT. IT'S OVER, O.K.? IT IS OVER. THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT WITH A REPORT ON YOUR QUERY. THEY'VE LOCATED 2 CYNTHIA HOWES-- ONE 59, THE OTHER 7. THERE'S NO RECORD OF A CYNTHIA HOWE DEATH. THERE ARE MANY JANE DOES THAT COULD FIT THE DESCRIPTION, BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO GO THERE TO SEE THE MORGUE SHOTS. NOTHING SEEMS TO BE GOING RIGHT FOR US, DOES IT? NO. CLINTON BICKFORD WAS IN TO SEE YOU. YEAH? HE'S SETTING UP A CITIZENS' ACTION COMMITTEE AND PUTTING COLONEL MOONEY IN CHARGE. TO DO WHAT? PROVIDE ARMED ESCORT FOR WOMEN AND ANSWER PROWLER REPORTS. IT'S TO KEEP THE PEACE. HOW DOES BICKFORD FIGURE HE CAN KEEP THE PEACE BY SPREADING FEAR? WHAT WILL YOU DO? I'VE SHOUTED AND THREATENED ALL I CAN. COLONEL MOONEY'S IN CHARGE. MAYBE HE AND CLINT WILL SHOOT ONE ANOTHER IN THE FOOT. WELL, THAT WASN'T BAD. IT WAS O.K. I COULD HAVE DONE A WHOLE LOT BETTER. SAM, YOU NEED TO RELAX, YOU KNOW? SOMETIMES IF YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING TOO LONG, YOU DON'T SEE IT ANYMORE. GET AWAY FROM IT, AND YOU'LL SEE IT DIFFERENTLY. I HAVE NO PLACE TO GO TO COME BACK AND SEE IT DIFFERENTLY. YES, YOU DO. YOUR PLACE? MY PLACE. I'M BACK. I SAW YOU. HEAR YOU GOT ANOTHER ONE SINCE I LEFT. THAT'S RIGHT. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN. MM-HMM. THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. I'M DOING WHAT I CAN. AND I TOLD YOU, THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR WHOEVER DID IT, INSTEAD OF FOOLING AROUND IN A LAKE LOOKING FOR MY GUN. I'M GOING TO GO HUNTING, MYSELF. YOU DON'T KNOW WHO TO LOOK FOR EITHER. HALF THE TOWN'S ARMED, AND YOU KNOW IT. I KNOW ABOUT BICKFORD AND HIS CITIZENS' COMMITTEE. DON'T LET ME CATCH YOU FOOLING WITH ANY GUNS. WE'LL SEE. WE'LL SEE. BILL... WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME CYNTHIA HOWE WAS PREGNANT? OH, COME ON, NOW. I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS PREGNANT. YOU GOING TO SAY I DID THAT, TOO? NO. DAVE MICHAELS DID THAT. HE WAS KILLED. SHE CONFIDED IN YOUR WIFE, AND SHE WAS KILLED. SHE VISITED REVEREND PHILLIPS, AND HE WAS KILLED. I DON'T KNOW WHO COULD BE NUMBER FOUR. TAKE IT EASY, BILL. I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET. I AM, TOO. YOU DIDN'T LOSE A WIFE THAT YOU LOVED. I DID. I DID. I KNEW CYNTHIA HOWE. YOU DID? YEAH. JUST CASUALLY, BUT I KNEW HER. WHEN DID YOU SEE HER LAST? SHE WAS HITCHHIKING DOWN THE HILL TO L.A. I PICKED HER UP. SHE CHANGED HER MIND AND SAID SHE WANTED ME TO DROP HER OFF AT DESERT CITY MOTEL, AND THAT'S THE LAST TIME I SAW HER. WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING? BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU. YOU LOOK WORRIED. I AM WORRIED. YOU DON'T THINK THAT BECAUSE I...JUST... I DON'T KNOW. LET'S GO. WHERE? YOUR PLACE. I'M SCARED, SAM. I MEAN, I'M REALLY SCARED. IT MAY BE NOTHING. WE MAY BE WORRIED ABOUT JUST NOTHING. I'LL HAVE SOMEBODY WITH YOU AT ALL TIMES, O.K.? O.K. MORNING, DORIS. MORNING, ROGER. HOW YOU FEELING TODAY, SAM? FINE, CHARLIE. NOT MUCH MAIL. A LETTER FOR YOU. OH, I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THAT. HEY, CHARLIE? CHARLIE? YES, SAM? HAVE YOU HEARD OF CYNTHIA HOWE? ROBERTA HOWE'S GIRL? YOU KNEW HER? I DELIVERED MAIL TO THEM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LAKE. NOT MUCH MAIL. GO ON. ROBERTA, THE MOTHER, WAS QUIET... POLITE... INVITED ME IN FOR TEA AND COOKIES. SHE WAS LONESOME. MR. CARTER SHOULD KNOW. SHE WORKED FOR HIM. THE GIRL, CYNTHIA, YOU KNEW HER? SAM, SEEING'S ONE THING, KNOWING'S ANOTHER. SHE JUST CAME OUT TO THE MAILBOX. ANYTHING ELSE? NOT OFFHAND. IT'S BEEN A WHILE. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE SHE WENT? DID SHE LEAVE A FORWARDING ADDRESS? NOT THAT I RECALL. DID SHE EVER MENTION A FATHER ANYWHERE? YOU EXPECT ME TO RECITE EVERY CONVERSATION I'VE EVER HEARD? NO, I GUESS NOT, CHARLIE. THANKS, ANYWAY. I SUPPOSE AFTER I FINISH I COULD GO THROUGH THE OLD FILES IF THEY HAVEN'T BEEN THROWN OUT. I'D APPRECIATE IT, CHARLIE. I'LL BE AT THE DESERT CITY MOTEL IN 45 MINUTES. I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK. JUST GET MY BAGS OUT. I'VE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT US. WE CAN WORK THINGS OUT. CAN'T YOU FACE THE TRUTH? I COULD IF YOU LET ME. WHEN I BECOME COUNTY ATTORNEY-- WHICH YOU NEVER WILL. THAT TAKES CHARACTER AND MONEY. YOU HAVE NEITHER. CAREFUL. THERE'S A POINT BEYOND WHICH YOU CAN'T PUSH ME OR BUY ME. BEEN REHEARSING THAT SPEECH LONG? THERE'S MORE IF YOU'LL LISTEN. SURE. IT'LL GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DO WHILE I'M PACKING. YEAH, I REMEMBER HER... WELL. SOMETIMES I WISH I COULD FORGET HER. HERE IT IS RIGHT HERE. "CYNTHIA HOWE." COMMITTED SUICIDE IN ROOM 12. WHO KEEPS IT UP? SAME FELLA THAT BOUGHT THE STONE. YOU KNOW HIS NAME? HE SAID HE WAS A RELATIVE. COMES HERE SOMETIMES AND PUTS DOWN FRESH FLOWERS. COULD YOU DESCRIBE HIM? I'LL MAKE A STAB AT IT. STRANGE TIME FOR YOU TO CALL. I'VE GOT TO DELIVER MAIL LONG BEFORE ANYBODY IN TOWN'S UP. I KNOW, BUT IT'S IMPORTANT. YOU BEEN DOING MUCH HUNTING LATELY? NOT LIKE I USED TO. YOU'RE STILL A GOOD SHOT, THOUGH? I CAN STILL GET MY LIMIT. WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT? WHY IS THE KILLER USING A SHOTGUN? I'D SAY A PERSON USES WHAT HE'S GOT, WHAT HE'S USED TO. YOU CAN KILL MOOSE WITH A SHOTGUN. I CAN'T WASTE SLEEP ON THESE QUESTIONS. I'M NOT FINISHED, CHARLIE. SAM, I DON'T HAVE TO TALK TO YOU IF I DON'T WANT TO. WHY DO YOU SAY THAT? YOU AFRAID OF SOMETHING? [BUZZING] PETER? [DOORBELL BUZZES] PETER? WHERE ARE YOU? GRACE? GRACE, IT'S ME OUTSIDE. I LOCKED MYSELF OUT. I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN. [GUNSHOT] CHARLIE, I THINK I'M COMING PRETTY CLOSE TO FINDING THE KILLER. I FOUND CYNTHIA HOWE. YOU FOUND HER? I FOUND HER GRAVE. SOMEBODY MUST STILL LOVE HER. HE BRINGS FLOWERS REGULARLY. YOU CERTAIN IT'S A HE? POSITIVE. DO YOU KNOW WHO HE IS? I DON'T KNOW HIS NAME, BUT IT'S SOMEBODY WHO'S CLOSE TO HER... IN DEATH, IF NOT IN LIFE. WHAT? SOMEBODY WHO'S REPAYING A DEBT TO HER WITH FLOWERS. SOMEBODY TOO AFRAID TO ACKNOWLEDGE HER WHEN SHE WAS ALIVE, ASHAMED OF HIMSELF IN HER, REFUSING TO GIVE ONE SIMPLE EXPRESSION OF LOVE, EVEN PRIVATELY. IMAGINE SOMEBODY LIKE THAT, CHARLIE. YOU'RE MAKING HIM SOUND LIKE A TERRIBLE PERSON, SAM. I'M GOING TO GET HIM. I'LL NAIL HIM FOR EVERY CRIME HE'S COMMITTED. WHY TELL ME ALL THIS? SO HE KNOWS I'M LOOKING DOWN THE BARREL AT HIM. IF HE'LL GIVE HIMSELF UP, HE'LL GET EVERY RIGHT IN THE BOOK BECAUSE HE'S GOT THE BEST DEFENSE THERE IS-- INSANITY. SAM? GOT A CALL FROM LAKESIDE SECURITY PATROL. SOMEBODY KILLED MRS. LOCKHARD. SHOTGUN, SPRAY PAINT-- SAME PATTERN AS ALL THE OTHERS. GOOD LORD, NO. CALL CARLSON. GO TO THE LOCKHARD'S. TELL DOC HAMMOND. RIGHT AWAY. I'M SORRY, CHARLIE, I THOUGHT... YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP. I'M SORRY. THANKS, JERRY. YOU'RE WELCOME. HEY, GIL. SEE SOMETHING, SAM? HE HEADED FOR THE LAKE. LOOKS LIKE HE WAS RUNNING. THERE'S YOUR KILLER, SAM. HIS WORLD JUST FELL OUT FROM UNDER HIM. SURE LOOKS LIKE. I GUESS WE'D BETTER GET HIM BEFORE HE SLIPS UNDER. WE'D HAVE TO WAIT TILL SPRING TO FIND OUT WHO IT IS. AUGUST 29TH. I LOVE DAVID MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD, BUT HE DOESN'T LOVE ME. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I FEEL SO DESERTED AND ALONE. I JUST DON'T SEE ANY FUTURE FOR ME. I DECIDED TO GO TO THE CLINIC IN LANCASTER. BETTY WHO WORKS AT THE DINER PICKED ME UP. BETTY? YEAH? I DON'T WANT TO GO TO LOS ANGELES. COULD YOU JUST DROP ME OFF AT DESERT CITY, SOME MOTEL? I HAVE TO THINK. YEAH, SURE. WHY NOT? LISTEN, I... I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU, BUT MAYBE IF YOU HAD A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP, HUH? SOUNDS SILLY, BUT I THINK YOU MIGHT FEEL BETTER. THINK MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO TAKE SOMETHING? I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING. LOOK IN MY MAKE-UP BAG, THERE IN THE GREEN BOTTLE. TAKE ONE OF THOSE. ARE THEY SAFE? YEAH, SURE, IF YOU ONLY TAKE ONE OR TWO. I'LL JUST...I'LL JUST TAKE ONE FOR TONIGHT. THIS IS THE BEST EXCUSE I'VE HAD FOR A NIGHTCAP RECENTLY. EVEN EDITH CAN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS. HERE YOU GO, SAM. HARVEY. JERRY. THANK YOU, DORIS. SAM, YOU KNOW YOU AND I DON'T ALWAYS SEE EYE-TO-EYE. BUT I'D LIKE TO PROPOSE A TOAST. TO SAM McNEAL, THE BEST POLICE CHIEF IN THE WEST. YOU WON'T FIND THE TOWN COUNCIL LACKING IN APPRECIATION. WE MIGHT EVEN PAY HIM. PETER LOCKHARD... IT DON'T SEEM POSSIBLE. YEAH? WHY? HE JUST DOESN'T FIT THE MOLD. FIT THE MOLD OR NOT, SAM FOUND HIM WITH THE GOODS. NOW MAYBE THIS TOWN CAN START LIVING INSTEAD OF DYING. I'D BETTER GET BACK TO THE BALL-AND-CHAIN. I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW, SAM. WE'RE ALL VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU. I'LL WALK ALONG WITH YOU. GET SOME REST, SAM. YOU NEED IT. GOOD NIGHT. NIGHT. SAM, I'M GLAD THAT'S OVER. I WAS GIVING UP HOPE FOR YOU. I KNOW. WHY DON'T YOU COME IN ABOUT NOON TOMORROW? YOU MIGHT FIND YOU CAN GET ALONG WITHOUT ME. BESIDES, I'M PROUD OF MY COFFEE. THAT'S WHAT DRIVES YOU INTO THE STREETS. NIGHT, SAM. NIGHT, DORIS. [TELEPHONE RINGS] HELLO? I HEARD THE NEWS. IT'S TIME TO UNWIND. THAT SOUNDS GOOD. I'M JUST FINISHING UP. DON'T TAKE TOO LONG. WE SHOULD RELAX AND CELEBRATE. I'M ON MY WAY HOME. SEE YOU IN A FEW MINUTES. BYE. SOMETHING'S REALLY GNAWING AT YOU, ISN'T IT? EVERYTHING HAPPENED SO FAST. LOOK AT THESE PICTURES OF THE SNOW PAINTINGS. THE FIRST, SECOND, AND THIRD-- ALL CAPITAL LETTERS. THE FOURTH IS BOTH UPPER AND LOWER CASE. MAYBE HE WAS IN AN AWFUL HURRY. PICTURES OF THE SNOW BOOT TRACKS... DO THEY APPEAR TO BE DIFFERENT? YEAH, THEY DO. MAYBE HARVEY HAD SOMETHING. MAYBE LOCKHARD DOESN'T FIT THE MOLD. IT'S A DIFFERENT SIZED SHOT AT THE LOCKHARD KILLING. COULD WE HAVE ANOTHER KILLER? I DON'T KNOW. WHAT DO WE DO? GO OUT TO BETTY'S HOUSE. PARK HALFWAY DOWN THE ROAD. STAY TILL I ARRIVE. RIGHT AWAY, SAM. MISS PRITCHARD? SAM McNEAL. CHARLIE EASTMAN, PLEASE. YOU HAVEN'T? WELL, MAYBE HE'S AT WORK. SORRY TO HAVE CALLED SO LATE. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [RADIO] REPORTS OF A SUNNIER POLITICAL CLIMATE DROVE THE STOCK MARKET HIGHER ON WALL STREET. [CYNTHIA] DEAR DADDY, OH, HOW I'VE WANTED TO WRITE THOSE WORDS. I KNOW YOU'RE MY FATHER. GOING THROUGH SOME OF MOM'S THINGS, I FOUND SOME LETTERS FROM YOU DELIVERED WHEN I WAS BORN. THERE WAS A PICTURE OF YOU FROM A NEWSPAPER. MOM MUST HAVE SAVED THEM FOR A REASON. I KNOW YOU'RE THE REASON. DADDY, I'M SENDING YOU THIS DIARY BECAUSE IT'S ALL I'VE GOT LEFT. EVERYBODY I'VE TRIED TO TALK TO OR ASK HELP FROM JUST HAVEN'T BEEN THERE FOR ME, AND I FEEL SO EMPTY. THERE'S ONLY ONE PLACE I WANT TO GO TO NOW, AND BETTY'S PILLS CAN HELP ME GET THERE. I COULD HAVE CALLED YOU DADDY AND LOVED YOU, BUT IT ISN'T POSSIBLE NOW BECAUSE OF THEM. GOOD-BYE. CYNTHIA. [RADIO] ...SNOW COMING EASTWARD IN THE NORTHERN ROCKIES. NOW FOR THE LOCAL WEATHER. [TELEPHONE RINGS] 74 IN LOS ANGELES UNDER SMOG-LADEN SKIES. A WARM FRONT JUST OFF THE COAST WILL KEEP IT PLEASANT FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.

I'M GOING TO MAKE UP FOR WHAT THEY DID TO HER, AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME. THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING, CHARLIE. YOU DID. THAT'S NOT TRUE, SAM. YOU NEVER ACCEPTED CYNTHIA. I COULDN'T. I WANTED TO, BUT I COULDN'T. DROP IT, CHARLIE. DO LIKE HE SAYS. CHARLIE? SAM... IN MY COAT... RIGHT SIDE... THIS? IT'S ALL IN THERE. ALL OF IT. I HAD TO DO IT.
