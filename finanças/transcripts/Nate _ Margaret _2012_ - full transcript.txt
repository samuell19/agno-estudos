ACTUALLY, I THINK THAT'S HOW MY PARENTS' FIRST DATE WENT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] RELATIONSHIPS ARE HARD. I WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO BE IN ONE. GUESS THAT'S WHY I'M STILL SINGLE. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK I SHOULD TRY AND FIND SOMEONE I LIKE AND HAVE HIM KICK MY ASS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN IF I STILL LIKE HIM, MAYBE THERE'S POTENTIAL. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHAT MY DAD DID, AND MY MOM DIDN'T SEEM TO MIND. [ LAUGHTER ] IN MY FAMILY, BRUISES WERE LIKE KISSES. A BLACK EYE NOT ONLY MEANT THAT DAD LOVED ME, BUT HE LOVED ME RECENTLY. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S NO BIG DEAL. DAD HIT MOM, MOM HIT ME, AND I KICKED THE CAT. THE CAT'S OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ] HE LOVED HER SO MUCH THAT SOMETIMES HANDS ALONE COULD NOT EXPRESS THE EXTENT OF HIS AFFECTION. ONE DAY, HE HIT HER IN THE FACE WITH A COFFEE MUG -- A LITTLE MUG-ON-MUG ACTION.

HE OWES ME A FAVOR, AND, WELL, I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE OF YOU IN A BIGGER VENUE. GIVE ME A CALL. CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING? THAT LADY WHO WAS WITH YOU THE OTHER NIGHT. IS SHE, LIKE, YOUR MOM OR SOMETHING? [ Laughing ] NO. THAT'S MARGARET. SHE'S MY FRIEND. SHE'S ACTUALLY MY BEST FRIEND. WE LIVE IN THE SAME APARTMENT BUILDING.
