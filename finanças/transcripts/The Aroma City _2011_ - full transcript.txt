No hatred No jealousy No depravity No evil Long, long ago among the Hengduan Mountains there existed a place called the Aroma City People there communicated by singing and passed message with aromas Many, many years later some variegated clouds sailed to the distant lands that were desolate and bleak To the hard and jagged rocks the earth woke gradually The sky was engulfed by wild flames When the Aroma City was almost annihilated the King and the Queen put the princess in an ark which would be drifting down the river May our god protect our princess from this calamity Are you Mr. Jiang? Yes I'm Chen Songhua I've gone over the plan Some questions on behalf of the directorate Why do you choose us? I've sent inquiries to several hundred persons but only you replied This project is not profitable at all You wouldn't have come if you wanted money Does the Aroma City exist? Without proofs neither you nor I can give a definite answer But I'm sure you'd like to do it Up to now no one would finance your plan Not profitable with no supporting facts either Why do you believe that I will? Because you are wiser You're wrong. I'm not better than others If only you can show me a reason One year ago I was a only cocky crude fop Son of a rich man As an indifferent singer I indulged myself in singing aimlessly My father was rich but I didn't like at all I was adored and surrounded by girls all the time Your mobile phone is off again.

Sue, hold on Hold on Book... That book... I can understand the book now Long, long ago there was a place called the Aroma City with no pains no sorrow no depravity, no jealousy no hatred or evil All the people there could sing well And their bodies sent forth aroma, just like yours To die for my love is what I wish most But one day... the sky was engulfed by wild flames When the city was almost annihilated the king and the queen put the princess in the ark which began to float around ever since May I have a look at the book from the Aroma City? Have you fully understood the book? Then the fire and her birthday you mentioned... I only hope she'll be in her happiness when her death comes Then you have cheated her But I believe all these are true You have only a backpack and a motorcycle and a legend you've imagined But you should know that snow mountain from ancient time till today has never been conquered No climber has ever returned To die for my love is what I wish most Anything else? If I fail to return promise me that you would according to the plan renovate the church help build the Aroma Hope School and keep the book and the secret in it I haven't promised you You have already done Would you buy some flowers, sir? How fragrant they are! At that moment I became widely known not for fame and gain but to meet you again That day I pray to gods not for happiness but for your safety during journey back That night I listen to sacred songs not for apprehending but for a delicate scent That time I travel far and wide not for the sceneries but to reunite with you on the way Have you found him? I saw only his motorcycle at the foot of the mount Get contact with Mr. Zhang We need to talk about the building of the school
