- Hey. - Hi. Didn't know when to expect you. I got here as soon as I could. - It's good to see you. - You, too. The tree isn't as bad as I thought. Joey worked on it. He'll be back this afternoon. I'm making lunch, you hungry? No, I'm good, thanks. We, uh, had to move him to the study, so... Okay. Okay. I made up your room. Thanks. Oh, Cal, this is Ace, from the hospital. Hello, Cal. I am very sorry about your father. I will do all I can for him. Okay, thanks. Um... I'm gonna drop my bag. Yes, of course. Just let me know when you're ready to come in to see him. Yeah, I will. Okay. My cousin Bambi was in a coma once, she was in this head-on collision. Anyway, she said that while she was in the coma, she could float through the quarters of the hospital, and that she saw this one nurse... Hey, Mr. T. Hey, beauty. How you doing? Yeah. I missed you. Oh, Cal. I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. It's okay. I found the puzzle in a closet, I hope you don't mind. No, make yourself at home. What are you listening to? Oh, uh... Brahms, I think. Classical music is what most people ask for. My father hated classical music. Okay. No, I mean, uh... Listen to whatever. Ah. Okay. - Thank you. - Hmm. Please, sit. Be with your father. You should probably wear a mask, just to be safe. I can wait it in the kitchen. Okay. Thanks. Hey. Hey. Mom told me about the tree, so... Yeah, thanks, I heard. Yeah, no problem. Almost done. You, uh, seen him? Yeah, just now. It's a rough deal, huh? Painful to watch. - Yeah. - Hey, Joey. Let me help you. Thank you. This is stuff for the Goodwill. They're gonna come for the treadmill tomorrow, and the other stuff. Okay. See you Wednesday? Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Uh, I'll come by later and finish up. Be strong, huh? Yeah, thanks. Hello, Cal. Uh... Oh! Uh... Sorry, just a sec. Oh, no. Take your time. How was dinner? Uh, you know, dinner. So, uh... Ace, is that your real name? Is Cal your real name? Sort of. It's short for, uh, Calvin, after Cal Ripken, who broke the record for consecutive baseball games played the year I was born. Oh, so you have a famous name? Well, to my father, at least. Ace is short for Apiyo-ma-ka Nyadimo. Because nobody in Montana, USA, can say Apiyo-ma-ka Nyadimo. Is your family here, in Montana? Uh, no. They are at home. In Nairobi, Kenya. Well... Have a good night, Calvin. Good night. Apiya-ma-kan Wadimo. Not too bad. Didn't think I'd see you 'till tomorrow. Ow! Cal! I'm sorry. You okay? Thought you were in bed. No, I can't sleep. I was just looking for this, for the store. Mmm. If you're hungry, there's, um, some fresh eggs. I just brought 'em in. So, um... Were you able to talk to the store about going full-time? Yeah. They said maybe after the beginning of the year, but not now. Everyone wants extra hours now, for the holidays. So, I think, more than likely, uh, when we finally sell the ranch, it'll still leave enough to cover the new medical bills. Uh, depending on how much we get. And how long he lives. I'm assuming Medicaid's kicked in for the in-home care, now? Most, but not all. And there's still household stuff, Valentina's still coming three days a week. You have enough to cover that? I can sell some things. Remember, proceeds from anything you sell technically belong to the bankruptcy court. Yeah. What about my mom's car? They were never married. Still, a good idea to keep it quiet. You don't wanna give his creditors anything to squawk about. You thought more about that old horse? Gotta deal with it, sooner or later. Um, yeah. I only ask, 'cause the big animal vet from Butte came over to my place this morning. Said he'd come by and take care of it tomorrow morning, before he leaves. Wait, tomorrow? Okay, yeah. It's the right thing to do, he's an old horse. Lived a long life. Any other animals left out there, might need looking at? Uh, no, just the birds. Hell, I'm real sorry about all this. Crying shame, Wade going out this way. Especially after what he's been through, the last couple of years. With losing your mom and all. Most important thing though, he's home. You got him home, where he wanted to be in the end. Hey! Saw your car. Got a sec? Sure. What's up? Uh... My, uh... My mom talk to you about hours? Yeah. She said they weren't gonna give her more time at the store. Yeah, well, it's actually less time. What do you mean? I mean, business sucks, so they're cutting back. You know, with the holidays. Yeah, she mentioned. Any chance she could go back to... Joey, with the bankruptcy and everything, even at three days a week, it's a stretch. You know, whatever people say, he always did right by her. Keeping her on. What happens to the ranch when he dies? It gets sold. I mean, he borrowed against it. It's not gonna be up to us. You know, she lived on that ranch a long time. Before Wade bought it. Before you and Erin. It's a part of her. I know, but there's nothing left now. For anybody. Mama. Fuck. Oh, God. A federal judge has ordered the shut down of the Dakota access oil pipeline, pending an environmental review. It's a major victory for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. The pipeline crosses beneath the Missouri River, where the Tribe gets its water, and has raised concern about pollution. The head of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, insists that the pipeline is safe. There has been a lot of back and forth. Erin? I just wanna see him one more time. Okay. How did you know what happened? Valentina called me. You're in touch with Valentina? How long's that been going on? Since you left? The whole time? Yeah. She doesn't know I'm here. But she's known where you live? Where you've... Where you've been? Your phone number? Like I said, I just wanna see him one more time. I'm leaving tonight, okay? Um... Give me a sec. Erin? Erin? He's not up here. He's dead, isn't he? No. He died before I got here. No. Erin! Oh, miss. I'm sorry. Who are you? Erin, this is Ace. He's taking care of Dad. So, where is he? In the study. Alone? You can leave him alone? Uh... He's not going anywhere. Take a breath, all right? It's okay, you can go inside. You'll want to wear a mask, just to be safe. Right. Would you like some - privacy with your father? - No. - I can wait just here... - No, please. Don't leave me alone with him. Yes, okay. Is he completely brain dead? No. Not brain dead. The stroke has left him unconscious, in a coma. Can he hear me, right now? Probably not. His brain continues to function to keep his body alive. But it is very badly damaged. He looks asleep. Like he might wake up. No, he will not wake up. Erin, are you okay? Yeah, I... She's been away a long time. It's never easy, Cal. Yeah. I just wasn't expecting him to be so not himself, you know? Shrunken and pathetic. Yeah. He's definitely not himself. But it was the car accident too, with Connie. You know, so he had kind of a two-year running start, even before the stroke. God! How is it that I'm feeling pity for him, right now? I think I should go. Yeah, I'm gonna just wait at the airport. It's just a couple hours, so... Really? You just got here. No, no, this is better. Stay the night, at least. Damn it. Damn it. If you're not Verizon, you won't get much of a signal. You're really leaving, just like that? Really? Here, just use mine. I can Venmo you. Don't worry about it. You're still doing business with this sleazeball? He was worse than Dad. Hey. It's fine. Yeah, tomorrow's still good. Hey. Um, I'm leaving, so thank you. Sorry about before. It was very nice to meet you, Miss Erin. Um... I'm sorry, what'd you ask me? His regular vet is Dr. Preston. Yeah, 4:00's fine. Bye. Who's the vet for? Um... For Mr. T. He's still alive? Yeah. Erin! Hey, yeah. Hi. Hi, it's okay. It's okay, Mr. T. Hi, beauty. Hi. Been a long time, hasn't it? Yes, it has. Hi. I can't believe he's still alive. He must be... Twenty-five. Same as you, remember? You're still such a lover, aren't you? Hey. Hi, Mr. T. Hi. - Hi. - Hey. Erin, why don't you stay? Really, cancel the ride. You just got here. No. I should go. What was that about, the vet? Is there something wrong with Mr. T? Um... No. No, nothing's wrong with him. We're gonna put him down. What? It's just what has to happen. He's old, and he doesn't have so much time left. And there's not gonna be anywhere for him after the ranch gets sold, I mean... So, you're just gonna kill him? Well, what do you suggest? He's not living a life here, anyway. I mean, he's... No one's around to exercise him. His arthritis is getting so bad, that... Right, yeah, so I know. Let's just kill him then. Fuck, Erin. He's at the end of his life. It's the right thing to do. The big animal guy from Butte happened to be around, so... He's coming by tomorrow. Erin! Erin! Yes, that sounds good. Shit. You're breaking up, but yes. Same flight, same time tomorrow. Sure, fine. I'm fine with the change fee. Hello? Hello? - Damn it! - What are you doing? I'm changing my flight. Why? Because if you're gonna kill Mr. T, I'm gonna be there with him. Erin, there's no point. Yeah, well, I've made up my mind. I'm gonna be there with him. So, really, there's no service anywhere? Um... Up by the gate, that works sometimes. Hello? Yes, I was just on the phone with another operator. I'm trying to book a flight for tomorrow. It's the exact same flight that I was on today, but I just need to book for tomorrow, please. Valentina's gonna be here tomorrow. Have you told her? About Mr. T? Uh, no. Um, it only came together this morning, after I met with Don. Maybe you ought to? Not everyone can handle this sort of thing as well as you. Okay, I'll tell her. I mean, what is all this still doing here? You know, I'm good. I can finish this, thanks. Okay. Um... You can use the bathroom in the hall, I'll use Dad's. Okay. Good night. Hi. Hey. Hi. You're okay. What happened? What's wrong? I'm taking Mr. T back with me. Back where? To New York. You live in New York? Upstate, yeah. Focus. I'm not gonna let you kill him. I'm taking him home with me. Erin, I'm not killing him. Yes, you are. That's exactly what you're doing, it's murder. How would you even get him there? I mean, can you afford that? Boarding, feed? I can figure it out. You really think this is right? It's exactly what it is. It's right. It's the right thing to do. For him, to be there for him. Right? Good night. I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm sorry. I know I said I wouldn't come. It's okay. I'm sorry. I don't understand. I gave her my word, I wouldn't tell you. But you knew what I was going through. How much I missed her, how hard I tried to find her. It broke my heart. And yet. All those nights you stayed up with me. I promised. She wants to take Mr. T back to New York with her. I heard. It's insane. Maybe. You don't think so? I think she doesn't know how to make the pain go away. But maybe this, she can do. Hey. Can you hear me? Great, okay. Yeah, I'm just trying to... It's... It's a family thing, so I kinda have to be here, you know? Yes, I'm aware. Okay, don't yell! Thank you. No, I... Yes, I'll try to cut it shorter, but, I figure probably a week. Yeah, yes, so, uh, the baby carrots and the radishes, if you still have them. Both the red and the golden beets, and everything else is the same as last week. Yes, great. Thank you, bye. I tried getting on the Wi-Fi, but there's a password now? Oh, yeah. And? Um, it's Libby, capital "L." Libby, for real? He chose it. Of course he did. You can use my computer... No, it's fine. You called off the vet? Yep. Good. Okay, yep. - All right. - Good. Just place it there. Okay. About half of the 200 acres go south from there. The eastern boundary's the river. It's quite a piece of land. Yeah. We used to raise cattle, but not really. My dad liked the whole idea of it, but he was a lawyer, so you know, we had a foreman. Still a couple dozen apple trees in the orchard, back there. You want me to take you? Yeah, that'd be great. My mom used to keep bees back there, too, but I don't think there are many of them left. Wait, wait, you're kidding right? Well, I have like three other options that are way cheaper than that, so... - Need a hand? - Uh-huh. Yeah, you know what? Um, actually, just forget it, thanks. So, three bedrooms, three baths... Yeah, I get it. I just... Um, yeah, bye. And with a new roof about five years back. Oh, that's meaningful. That's the garage. It only takes one car. More than a lot of ranches. There is still blood circulating, and neurological activity. The muscles and the tendons, they feel and react. And perhaps communicate something to whatever being still resides in your father's body. Would you like to help me? Here. Uh... No, um, I don't know how. Trust me. No training required. Um... Should I? No, no mask. You've been here long enough, it's okay. Okay. Place your hand right there. Okay, place this one here. Can you feel his pulse in your hands? I don't think so. Hold him lightly here, around the ankle. Yes, like that. Okay. By the bone, as lightly as you can. Good. And now, can you feel your own pulse there, too? For me, when a person who has come to a place like this, alive, but in a way we don't understand, that rhythm you're feeling, it can be like a conversation. What are you doing? Um... Helping Ace. I need to talk to you for a minute. Please. Um... I found a truck and a trailer, but it's up north near Browning, at the reservation. Valentina hook that up? Nope, Craigslist. You're buying a truck and trailer? - Mmm-hmm. - To take back to New York? - Yup. - Why? Because you wanna kill Mr. T, and I don't, so, I need to figure out a way to get him back home with me. And I just need you to drive me there, tomorrow. It's fucking freezing out there! Jesus, Cal! Okay, fine. I'll drive you. Thank you. Did you hear all that? Not all. Mr. T is the old horse in the barn? Yeah. He must be very special to her. She wants to take him back to New York. Her horse, I understand. No, not hers. I mean, Mr. T was ours. Hmm. Erin had a horse called Pepper. Pepper and Mr. T. Yeah. Pepper died the night she left. Seven years ago. You must have been thinking something was up with her, yesterday. Yes, I... I could see she was agitated with your father. Yeah, she was agitated. It was our father who killed Pepper. I don't think I can do that anymore. Uh, yes, no, of course. No problem. Thank you for your help. I just can't believe she came back like this, now. She didn't just leave here... Seven years ago, she ran away. From him. She wrote this article in the school paper, about what a slimy lawyer he was for helping cover up the toxic mess at the mine. And then this TV network got hold of it, and everything just went nuts. I mean, she... She probably shouldn't have done it. It was humiliating for him. But what he did to her... I mean, he'd hit us before. Not like super violent or anything, or all the time, but he was that kinda guy. And the thing is, she's sort of like him. Not the violent part, but, temperamentally. All that fire in their bellies, and how smart and quick they both are. Could you, um... Yeah. Thank you. We have different moms, Erin and I. Hers died while she was being born. And that was kind of it, for him. He hired my mom to help take care of Erin, and then... you know, I came along. But it wasn't the same with Connie. My mom. Not like it was with Libby. And Erin could feel his distance too, you know? Everyone could, it was obvious. Maybe that's why she held me so close. I mean, we were always together. Inseparable. I saw what happened that night. What he did to her. Coming home from cross country practice. As soon as I came into the house, I could hear it. Right here, in this room. I looked in, and he was just... Just whaling on her. Really bad, like a crazy person. And I just froze. I didn't know what to do, I just stood there. He's screaming, and she's crying. And I'm just standing there, dumb. And then she looks up at me, and she's not crying anymore. And I knew what I should do. What was right. That I could stand up to him, that I could stop him. But I didn't. And then, I ran out of the house, and I tried not to think about it. I thought everything would be okay. Next morning, I found Pepper in the barn, lying in a pool of her own blood. Bullet in her head. That part had to be the worst for her, just knowing what he'd done. I tried finding her any way I could, but, you know, she didn't wanna be found. And... After a while, her phone stopped working, and I... I stopped trying. Your father, you have spoken with him about what he did? No. No, never. I mean... I was 15, I didn't know how to do that. I guess I still don't. Hey, it's Erin. Um, we're... We're getting ready to leave, and I just wanted to call and check in about, like, the payment situation. Yeah. Well, I was thinking I could just... My bank's out of state, so I can... It'd probably be easier for me to wire you the money, or... Yeah, I'll just get out however much I can, and then the rest, I dunno... Do you have a Venmo, or something? Okay. Okay, cool. See you then, bye. You know, there's a phone inside. You don't have to stand out here. I'm good. I can't believe you still drive this thing, it smells like high school. Suits me. Hello? Oh, yeah, this is Cal, hi. Um... Yeah, well, it's a 2013 Lexus RX-350. Well, it's original paint. Um, it's in great shape, and the seats are leather. Tan. It was my mom's, she barely drove it. Um... Wanna come take a look? Well, I'm gone today, but, um... Okay. Yeah, sure. All right, thanks, bye. You good? The Lexus you're selling, that was Connie's? Yeah, why? She bought it a little while after you left. They were in his car when she died. It'll be two years in March. Oh. I live in Cheyenne, now. Junior year, I did an internship at the city planning department. I'm a civil engineer. I will be, eventually. Um... And after I graduated, they took me on. It's mostly ADA compliance stuff, but I like it. And we're building some, too. A big library next year, and a pedestrian bridge downtown. You know how I love bridges. I live by myself. Little house on the south side of town. Not far from where we saw Kid Rock that time. You remember, uh, Cheyenne Frontier Days? I have a cat. Oscar Wilde. Souvenir from my last relationship. Do you wanna check my phone for reception? You don't have any, I just checked. He said to make the second left after the trailer, so... Okay. So, this... Yeah, turn left. He's got a red pickup. Is that it? Yeah. Yeah, that must be him. Mukki? Sure am. I'm Erin, this is Cal. Welcome. Sorry if you were waiting long. Oh, I'm used to it. We're just gonna head up this way a bit, and round the corner. Well, let's go then. Take a left here. Drive must have been beautiful, innit? Yeah. Day like this, you could drive forever. Yeah, it was nice. You need to take a right, here. Must be a little cold up here for you guys, huh? Yeah, a bit. Uh, right here. What's this, a '93? Uh, '94. - Nice! - Yeah. And you're gonna take a left, here. Pull up right there, that's it. Well, there she is! Give me a sec, and I'm gonna go fetch the battery. - You wanna pop the hood? - Sure. - Is that the trailer? - Yeah, it is. I like to keep it fresh. Right. Um, so, I'm just wondering when the last time it got moved was? Like, since you ran it? Hmm... A month or so ago, maybe. Maybe less. Nah, maybe more. I can't remember. Funny thing about not remembering. Sometimes you're glad for it, other times it gets you into trouble. Well, let's get her humming for you. Sorry. Like I said, keeps it fresh. - What's that? - Shit! The alternator belt is loose. Give me a second, I'll tighten it up. Okay. Um... Erin, have you really thought this through? It's just an old truck, calm down. What? Two seconds. Sorry. You got a phone to shine a light down here for me? Oh, yeah. Are there spare tires in the truck and trailer? Sure are. You might wanna check the pressure. But, yeah, that ought to do it. Sorry. Purr like a kitty cat, right? Nice. So, you got the cash? And then we'll go take care of the Venmo? - Yeah. - Erin. Um... Maybe you wanna take it for a test drive, first? Just make sure you're comfortable, right? Okay. I mean, you don't mind, do you? No, go ahead. Road loops around. She your girlfriend? Sister. Ah. Right. Taking this right back down state? Yeah, just for a bit, just to get the horse. Where then? New York. New York, really? Your horse don't like Montana no more? He's a very old horse. Twenty-five. Oh, you're one of them sentimental horsey girls? He's a special horse, so I'm bringing him back home with me. Home? Where you planning on keeping an old horse in the Big Apple? I'm upstate. You got other horses at home? No. What, you think I'm being stupid? Of course not. I've done way stupider things for animals than drag a horse from Montana to the Big Apple. Hey, why don't you jump in? We'll test the lights. Okay, uh, left now! Now, right! Now, tap the brakes! Eh, we're good to go! Easier than I thought. The heater should be working fine. I left a blanket in there for the horse, but they're usually good for some cold. Cool, thanks. You know, my family came from there, back in the day. Yeah, from New York? You're a New Yorker? Mohican. My people wandered to Wisconsin, that's polite company for "got run off." Grandfather went to Montana, got married in the '30s. Now home is here with the Ampskapi Piikani, the Blackfeet. Just like your old horse is gonna be home upstate. You got bars? Yeah. Just straight up that way, 100 meters away. Okay. Nice to meet you! You, too. What do you think Mukki does for a living? I don't know. Did you see his keyring? Yeah. He's got a lot of keys. As Yellowstone Public Radio News reports, buckthorn is now pushing out native vegetation by the Yellowstone River, in south eastern Montana. McConnell: Eventually we would end up with dense shrub layers, rather than the iconic Yellowstone River cottonwood forests, that we have currently. McConnell's concerned that if left alone, this insidious invasive could overtake the entire park. McConnell: Once it gets in, it literally chokes out everything else. What's up? It just started losing power, and cutting out and sputtering. Let me look. It's probably the fuel line. Okay, wait, let me help you. Just stop, back up. Let me... Cal? Hey, what's going on? No. Are you two okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm sure he can help. Okay, I got it. Thank you, you're a life saver. Ah, don't worry. Yeah, I'll keep you posted. Here's the number. Oh, no. I'm not doing that. He'll like hearing from you better. What do you mean? Just stuff about the ranch. What stuff about the ranch? Nothing. Just call him. Hi, Joey. Yeah, yeah. It's me, hi. Um... Yeah, so I'm just here for, really, just a bit, just to see Dad, but... Well, that was awkward. But I mean, he seems happy to help, so... Well, I mean, help me. You're dead to him. See, I told you. It was a joke, he sounded fine. He's just gonna be a while, so... Well, it could be worse. Thanks. This rig is a piece of shit, isn't it? Yup. You mind? Not good for the palate, but cooks all seem to smoke. It confuses people. You're a cook? Mmm-hmm. This little farm-to-table place, near Red Hook, called Sinew. In the Hudson Valley, in New York. Right. Upstate. Right. Supposed to be ironic. "Sinew." Tough and strong, not something anyone would actually wanna eat. Get it? Our thing is that we use the whole animal, snout to tail. You heard of that? Mmm. So, we kill it. Cook it. Serve it. All of it. When I first left here, I went out and stayed with my mother's sister in Albany. You know, Deena? She got me a job at this... ...diner near her. It was a shit-hole, but I liked it. Loved cooking. So... Saved my money... ...and got into the Culinary Academy, and that was that, now I'm a cook. You know where we are? Um... MT-69, the middle of nowhere. Yeah, that. But, no, we're 15 minutes from Copperhead. Yeah, I guess we are. Let's go. Really? In for a penny... Come on! What's with this state, and phone service? Oh, yeah, I remember where we are now. That's it, just pull up right over there. I didn't think I'd ever be back here. Somehow, I always thought I would. Wow, you sort of forget... And then, there it is. This place always seemed like a miracle to me. Like they were building something into the ground. Not just digging a hole, but actually making something. Carving one shape out of another. I see now where the engineer in you was born. Yeah, from the belly of the beast that our dad helped shield from government oversight. Reminds me more of Dante's Circles of Hell. What? Inferno, you read it? The unbaptized are in the first circle. Then there's the gluttons. The avaricious, the wrathful. The heretics. And our people, the plunderers, the hypocrites. You have this memorized? Yeah. Then the barrators... The counselors of fraud, my fave. Wait, counselors of fraud, really? Yeah. I mean, in translation, yeah. That could have been his business card. Hmm. You'd think they'd have filled it in or something, by now. Nah. Cheaper and easier to leave it alone and keep everyone away. Just another crime scene out in the Old West. Yeah, there should be caution tape. Growing up, we were so indoctrinated with the whole Big Sky thing. The field trips to Yellowstone, endless horizons. I really bought it. Then after I left, and being in New York, I started wondering if it's just so big that... you lose any sense of perspective at all. If it's so big that you... step outside and feel like you're inside of something. And now? Have you found your way out of it? You know what the final circle of hell is? The very bottom of the pit? It's reserved for the... betrayers of special relationships. Like, community... Kin. We should go. Okay. Yeah. When did you read the Inferno? Cooking school. What where you doing with him yesterday? With who? Dad, when I saw you. You and Ace. Um... Ace was explaining to me how a body can still react, even after the brain stops functioning. Did you talk with Ace, about us? About me, what happened? Why does it matter? Just curious. I was just explaining to him what was going on... Never mind, there's Joey. Erin, jeez! Hey. It's so good to see you! Yeah, good to see you. Thanks for coming, Joe. Yeah, sure. Is this Mukki's old-ass truck? You know Mukki? Yeah, I know Mukki. Okay, well, um, I'll ride with you, yeah? Okay. All right. Uh, Cal, do you wanna follow us? Yep. Cool. My mom said she's known where you've been this whole time. Yeah. You always had a way with her. I think she just understood, that's all. Uh-huh. Man, you've been missed around here. I mean, Cal, you know, but me, too. The three of us being together. I had to go. Yeah, I get it. You know, it's just... It's just not the same place. It's not the same place without you home. You know, I can fix this, uh, old-ass truck for you if you want? Oh, yeah? I think so. Yeah, that would be great. And if I can't, you know, maybe you outta let me drive you and Mr. T out east. Why would you? Why not? Why wouldn't I help you? It'd be fun. And it's what's right. Thank you, Joey. I'll think about it, okay? Okay. You think about it. This is very beautiful, Erin. Well, there wasn't much other than the bird, but, the orchard still has apples and honey, so... Erin's a cook, Ace. Ah, yes, I can see! Some things are clear without explanation, Cal. Bon appetit. - Mmm, that's good. - Mmm-hmm. I remember noticing the orchard when I first arrived. Makes the house so beautiful. Yeah, and I'm okay with that. Takes forever getting anywhere. Which is fine. What I will never get used to is the cold. No one does. You know what they say about Montana. You don't like the weather, just wait five minutes. So, um... Ace. I hear you've gotten a little taste of our family history from my brother. Ah, yes. This is true. Pretty rough, huh? Well, I mean, I'm glad you know. Right? You should know, you spend a lot of time with him. You should know whose asshole it is you're wiping. Our asshole. I can tell you, to a nurse, one asshole is very much like another. Your father is a man whose past is complete now. Nothing more will be added to his story. He is the sum of his days. Excuse me. This still happens? I guess, I don't know. Okay. Ace, is everything all right? The ventilator backup power isn't working. I have to bag him. Uh, there used to be a generator in the garage for when this would happen. Go, quickly! How long can you do that? Uh, if the electricity doesn't return, we'll have to get him to the hospital. Over there. Fuck! What's going on? Erin, I need you to come over here. Put both your hands on this, do what you see me doing. I can't. Erin, now. Erin, please, we don't have time! Watch your step, watch your step. This one down here. Okay, and then your left hand. Okay. Okay. I think he may be having a heart attack. Please, just be steady and consistent, as you squeeze. Please try and squeeze more firmly, just a little. Well, I guess we don't need the generator anymore. What happened? Erin? Erin, what happened? I should never have come back here. What happened? I should never have fucking come back here. Erin? I should never have come. I mean, what the fuck? Why did you just leave me alone with him? Erin, I'm sorry. He had a heart attack! What? He had a fucking heart attack! Are you deaf? Why did you just leave me alone with him? Ace needed to do the chest things, the compressions, so I had to keep that bag going with my hands. I'm, like, breathing for him, keeping him alive with my fucking hands! I just saved his life! I feel sick. I feel sick. Why did you leave me alone with him? Erin, I thought I could get the generator. Not tonight, seven years ago. You saw what he was doing to me, but you left. You left me alone with him. Why? How? I saw you there, and I thought, he'll stop this. He's gonna do something, he'll save me. I'm so sorry. But you didn't! What more did you need to see? What did he have to do to me to push you into that room? That fucking room, right there? I don't know. I... I couldn't. I was afraid. And I didn't think that he... That he'd kill me? He almost killed me. He broke my nose. Separated my shoulder. Cracked my ribs. And it went on. And it went on, and I couldn't get him to stop! And at the hospital, they wanted to call the police, but I wouldn't tell them what happened. I loved you, so much! So much! How could you just walk away? I don't know. How could you abandon... I don't know! I've been asking myself that for seven years, and I don't fucking know! Am I a coward? Is there something wrong with me? Every night I close my eyes, and all I see is your face. That look on your face, pleading with me to make him stop. And every night I wake up, and I think that something must be wrong. That can't be what happened. I couldn't have walked away. But I did. That is what happened. And that's how it's always gonna be. I didn't stop him. I didn't even try. And I am sorry, I really am. I missed you. So much. Yeah. Yeah, me, too. Okay. Why don't you go get some rest? You can use my room, I'll sit with him. That is okay. I'm good, Cal. Really, I'd like to. It has been a trying night... I need to be alone with him, now. Okay. I'm going to go for a walk. I see the rain has stopped. Good night, Cal. I would have liked to have known Erin's mom. To see how happy she made you. But maybe that's just a story, right? That you told yourself. And us. Your great love for Libby. Your great sadness when she died. It was something my mother always took in stride. Being less for you. An afterthought. Much like she accepted your anger, and your distraction. All just... part of the package. But Erin was different. It hurt her, and you couldn't see that. You couldn't see why she did what she did, how much she needed you. I used to think to myself, how can someone so smart be so dumb? Now I wonder... how could someone so loved have been so cruel? You lived as if life were a sad burden. Maybe being dead will be better. During the power failure, he may have experienced a cardiac event. But after, yes, he was stable. For a time. Did you call the hospital? No, the storm had not stopped, and, his vital signs were strong. Our decision, my decision, was to wait until morning. But most sadly, then, he passed. They're taking the body away. Hey, Mr. T. Hey. Hey, beauty. Hey. Hey. Did you get a hold of Joey? Yeah. And? He likes the idea. Are you going to be okay? Yeah. Thank you. Ace, how many of these have you had, your patients? Um... I don't know. I guess it's not something that I like to count. No. Of course not. The curbside is for immediate loading and unloading only. Violators may be ticketed and towed. Thank you for driving me. Yeah, sure. Of course. Thank you for coming home. Okay. Call me. Yeah. Soon. I will. You, too. I will. Okay. Okay. Drive safe, back to Cheyenne. Okay. What kind of cat is Oscar Wilde? He's an ornery gray tabby. He would be. Okay. Bye. Bye. I'm comin'. I'm comin'. All right, come on. Easy, boy. Yeah, I know. Beautiful, innit? All right, here we go Mr. T. What do you think? It's all yours. Go on. Go on, now! Hey. Hoka hey! Montana horse still wants to run, innit? Sure seems that way. Maybe you ought a try running after him. You'd be surprised. I'll give him a head start. We have plenty of time. Yeah.
