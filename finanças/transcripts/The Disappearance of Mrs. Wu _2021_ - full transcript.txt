[theme music] [♪] [electricity buzzing] [♪] [no audible dialogue] [girl] Grandma, where's your red sweater? Where is it? In the bottom drawer. Open it. There's something for you. A tape. VHS? -Wow, this is older than me. -[chuckles] I was asked to give it to you on your 18th birthday. That was last month. -Oh, it slipped my mind. -Nothing slips your mind. Old age. It is from your father. My real father? Who else? Your mother doesn't know about it, so not a word. Why? I thought he was dead. Mom... are you ready yet? -That's a good question. -Let's go. Everyone is waiting. This party, it's all for you. No, it's not for me. It's for you, Mary, to look like a good Chinese daughter. Grandma, that's not very nice. But it is true. The truth is I'll take what I can, seeing how many I've missed. [girl] Ah, here is the red sweater. -Okay. -[grunts] Uncle David is here. This really is for you, Grandma, to celebrate you. Emma, you didn't come home last night again with Karen? Why? I don't see a problem. Oh, let's go, let's go. Where's Charlotte? She's busy. I'll push you. With your bad hip? My hips are fine. Come on. Let's go. [Mary sighs] [group] ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday Dear Grandma ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ [Emma singing in Mandarin] ♪ Happy birthday Dear Grandma ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ [cheering] Grandma, close your eyes and make a wish. [pensive piano music] [Mary] Come on, Mom. Just one wish. Then you can open all your gifts. I wish for this party to be over. [nervous laughter] I guess that counts as a wish. -[blowing breath] -[applause] Now my brother and I will cut the cake. [clown] Ooh, ooh-ooh. Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh! Born in the year of the dragon? -[balloon pops] -[group gasps] O-kay. -Let's go. -[Charlotte] Okay. [David] Mom. Mom. Mom. Um, stay. [laughs] Mary and I were just trying to... Oh, you two know what I want? You can't live on your own. Why not? I have-- I have a friend. For a few hours a day. Why can't you just accept we are trying to do the right thing here? Well, enjoy your party. -Let's go. -Oh, Grandma. Selfie. Come on, guys. -Good. -[chuckles] Get inside. [camera clicks] [♪] [Charlotte sighs] You could have stayed a little longer, put in some effort. That was so rude. You don't even know the difference between rude and honest. Oh, I do, and honestly, you can be a real rude bitch. -[Emma gasps] -Emma, take me to the garden. You two, go get some iced tea. -[Karen] Oh, but I hate iced tea. -I don't. Come on. Mom just hates this place. [chuckles] You could have moved her into your place. [Mary] So easy for you to say, living in Seattle. I am the one here who's taking care of everything. David, we've asked your mother to move in with us. She flat-out refused. -Because she hates me. -No, she doesn't. Well... [scoffs] I'm not you, the golden boy. Mary, you know full well David offered to move her to Seattle, and she said no to him too. You make such a drama out of everything. Me? Make a drama? Says Miss Taiwan from another century who still thinks she wears a crown. -[woman clears throat] -Better a former pageant queen than a current-- Okay, okay, okay. We have company. Hello. Ah, I buy my cakes from Costco too. It's not from Costco. [woman] Well, my mistake. May I have a word with you? I'm so sorry to take you away from the party, but there's just a couple of things that I need to discuss with you. Your mother's health is fragile. The last infection took a toll. What are you saying exactly? -Just that-- -Did you bring my sanitizer? With congestive heart failure at her age and in her general physical condition, it's just hard to predict how much time she has left. Then why do you have her eating in the cafeteria with all that noise and all those people? Well, at her age, isolation is unhealthy. What about the germs? -[chuckles] Germs? -Germs? You had me eating rotten eggs when I was ten. -That was in China. -[sighs] Can we please stay focused on Mom? Sometimes you're just impossible. [woman] If you have any other questions, you can please feel free to call my office. -[David] Thank you. -Mm-hmm. [sprinklers hissing] What about my birthday gift? You know, I don't have much time left. Well, I can't just get you out of here. Oh, so you'd rather leave me here and die with regret? Well, now that you put it that way... You know, I want to see the beautiful beach, the waves, the sunset. [chuckles] And my special rock. And there's something we have to do for Friday. Friday? The day after tomorrow? -Yeah. -How are we gonna get there? With Karen's special plan. We have to leave tonight. [Emma sighs] -[Mary] Mom? -[David] Mom. We're sorry if the party upset you. I hope you know Mary and I meant well. We're leaving tomorrow, so... -Oh, take the gifts. -Uh, but they're for you. Give them to the charity you run. It's a charity for girls. Don't they have grandmothers? Got a terrific golf charity that would love the money. Brian, she gave them to me. It's a cultural thing. You're not Chinese. Angela, how many times do I have to tell you don't talk to my husband like that? What? I'm just telling the truth. The truth-- just wait till the next time you're in my dental chair. [chuckles] [Karen gasps] Oh, it's like a spy movie. -I love it. -Stealing your dad's van? Stealing? I'm not stealing. I'm just borrowing it. You don't think he'll get upset? -Maybe, maybe not. -I'm not sure about this. Maybe we should just ask Mom. [Lily] Oh, no, no. Don't tell your mom. Listen to your elder. That's Chinese. -[laughing] -[Emma] But Carmel is so far away. What if something happens to you? If something happens, something happens. Can I rely on my granddaughter? Yeah, sure. Of course you can count on me, Grandma. Mm. [Karen laughing] Oh, remember, Charlotte doesn't know. Charlotte doesn't know what? Oh, Charlotte doesn't know how to make Irish soda bread. You love my soda bread. It's the best, not too dry. Eat it, grouchy. Hmm. -Oh, it doesn't look so awful. -[laughter] All right, what are you three plotting? Mm, you know my plan. I call it "Operation Songbird." -Would you help? -Songbird, huh? All right, I'm in. -Okay. -[laughter] -[Karen] Oh, my gosh. -[Emma] What? Your grandma and Charlotte, what a pair. Uh-huh. -A lot of history there. -Yeah. Charlotte's gonna be lost without her. What about you? I don't know. Feels like everybody's leaving, including you. Okay, okay. Look. I'm not even leaving town. UCLA is awesome. I don't know what I want to do. Architecture? Act? Sing? Oh, Mom says, "Be a dentist." -Boring! -[chuckles] Emma, your life isn't boring. Well, high school is without you. No more hanging out on the bleachers, making fun of cheerleaders. -What about Rick? -He likes cheerleaders. Okay, I wasn't talking about cheerleaders. You should ask him to prom. No. I can't do that. It's up to the guy to ask, and he's not going to ask me. [Emma] Rick is too... gorgeous. [scoffs] And you're so ugly? [chuckles] What? [laughing] [Karen] Okay, see you later... Operation Songbird. Karen, do you really think that's a good idea? [Karen] Sure, it is. But just remember you can't tell your mom. 'Cause this mission is top secret. [both laugh] Hey, you should reach out to Rick 'cause you are gorgeous. [kisses] [Emma and Karen giggling] -[vehicle door closes] -Bye, Mrs. Carter. [engine starts] ♪ Someday when I grow up ♪ And it's only like number four. Not too many. Emma Lillian Carter, stop. -I saw that. -So what? No big deal. No big deal? Oh, so the two of you do that all the time? What else do you do with Karen? What's that supposed to mean? Karen's a lesbian. She's not. Oh, you sure about that? -Ben. -What? My hockey coach is a lesbian. She's awesome. So what if she is? That was a best friend kiss, not a kiss kiss. -What is a best friend kiss? -[laughter] -Ben, hey. -[Mary] Ben, Henry. This isn't funny. What if neighbors saw what I just saw? What will they think? Who cares? This is West L.A. But do you know how much this would upset your grandmother? [Emma] Oh, now you care about her? Really? [speaking Mandarin] And so why did you put her in that prison? I did not put her... That is none of your business. I am your mother. You will respect me and do as I say. This isn't China. We live in America. Oh, listen. Why don't we all just take a breath? Emma, you are not going to see Karen anymore. You understand? I won't allow it. Know what you are? Control freak. Unfair and judgmental and way more of a dragon lady than Grandma. Why did I bother coming back here? [stomping] [door slams] This is actually like that one game between the L.A. Kings and the Vancouver Canucks, when everyone was fighting so much they forgot why they were there in the first place. Why? To play hockey.

A kidnap? We've called the police, but purely as a precaution. Emma, something's happened. Emma? Brian? -Ow! -Oh! Honey. [David grunting] [David shouting] Please. Men. Okay, thank you. Emma? Oh, God. She's run away. Honey, let's not jump to conclusions. I mean, who would make the bed before running away? That's Emma, total neat freak. I can't imagine where she gets that from. [knocking at door] -[door opens] -[man] Mrs. Carter? -Yes? -Detective Martinez, LAPD. I'm here about the disappearance of Mrs. Wu. -Come in. -[door shuts] My daughter's also gone, probably because of the whole lesbian thing. Well, that must be my mother in her wheelchair. Okay, what about the person pushing the chair? Is it possible that that's your daughter? No, that is definitely not Emma. -You sure? -Of course I'm sure. You don't think I would recognize my own daughter? Wait. Wait. What? Our home surveillance system. Maybe it'll show us what happened to Emma. That's Karen kidnapping my mother. -No way. -How do you know? Well, Karen wouldn't do that. Ben thinks she's cute. I thought you said she's a lesbian. -Doesn't mean she's not cute. -Oh. -I told you wait upstairs. -But I wanna know where Emma is. [Brian] We all do, bud. [Emma] Hi, this is Emma. You know what to do. -If you don't, well... -[phone beeps] Emma? Where are you? I'm worried. And I'm sorry. You have reached Lily Wu. -Leave a message. -[phone beeps] Mom... whoever did this is going to pay. -Show me that footage again. -Let me have that back. There you go. Charlotte. That's Charlotte. Who's Charlotte? That person. I was here at 6:30, and it was gone by then. I don't know, it just... Eddie? -Where is Karen? -Brian? -Eddie, how are you? -Uh, Karen... I would assume she's at school. School? Seriously? Does she drive there in a Magic Dumpling van? I-- I don't know what this is. Um... -If you're covering for her-- -[Eddie] Covering? What are you talking about? I think she's talking about the Magic Dumpling van. Oh, damn, that, uh... that's Karen. Uh, no stolen van. Sorry. Obviously a misunderstanding. Sorry to trouble you, Officer. -Thank you. -I know Karen. She's probably cooked up some scheme and dragged Emma into it. Wait, hold-- hold on. Hold on. Karen's my daughter. Whatever she's doing, I'm sure she has a good reason. A good reason? Then why didn't she ask you about taking the van? I guess she didn't want me to know about it. So how good a reason could it be? Okay, can we all just pump the brakes, Mrs. Carter? Let's just think this thing through, okay? You got your mom, you got her former caregiver, your daughter, and her best friend. They're driving around in a dumpling van. That doesn't exactly sound like a kidnapping. It sounds like they needed a van for the wheelchair to go somewhere. -Carmel. -[Brian] Carmel.

Mrs. Carter, if your mom is competent to manage her own affairs, we don't exactly have the authority to stop her from taking a road trip with her granddaughter. I have power of attorney. What if she isn't competent? Mary. [chuckles] You know, your mother would never forgive you if you... She won't forgive me if she's dead. If you think you know where she's going, Mrs. Carter, have you thought about-- just considered maybe going there and talking to her? Talk? To my mother?

They built their American dream in Carmel. Some of their happiest memories were on that beach. But Mom says she hates Carmel. By the time your mother got to the States, your grandad had already moved the family to Los Angeles. [Emma] Grandma's tired. We should find a place to stay tonight. Oh, look at that cute little bed-and-breakfast. Do you want to stop there? [Mary] Can you drive faster? [Brian] Relax. Want to hear some music maybe? [Mary] No, I don't want to listen to music.

[Karen laughing] [Emma] Do you think it's funny? Oh, come on. You know Jane. She loves to gossip. [Emma] I didn't think we kept secrets. Okay. Let's not fight about Jane, okay? It's not about Jane. It's about you. Best friends tell each other everything. You should have told me first, but coming out is a big deal. Why should Jane be the first one to know? You don't... you don't even like Jane. Or-- or do you? Emma, wait. Okay, no secrets. I like girls. Okay. So, why not tell me before? Because... I... you know, haven't actually done anything about it. Wow. I've always seen you as the experienced one. Yeah, well, inexperienced real me. Then how do you know for sure? Well... [sighs] ...how do you know what you are? I just know inside. There's your answer. I did not say a word to Jane, okay? You are the first one that I'm telling, Emma. Here and now. I will be back. Later. [door opens] [sighs] [owl hooting, insects buzzing] [videotape sliding] [man speaking indistinctly] It's me, your baba. Xiao Wei, your name. It means "precious." Happy 18th birthday, Xiao Wei. Sorry... no present. Just this old videotape. I wish I was there all this time to see you grow up. Because when I look into the camera, I think I can almost see you, so strong and beautiful. Xiao Wei, Baba is sorry to make you wait all this time wondering what really happened. Maybe now you're big enough... [sighs] ...to understand and for me to tell you everything. Me and your mama, we were arranged to be married ever since we can remember. Your mama was only 18 when your grandparents left her in China to go to the U.S. She was so upset and lonely. Lucky I was there. I let her take it all out on me. So I was so used to her píqì. Do you have a píqì too? [Emma chuckles] Actually, your mama, she's the kindest, most loving and giving person I know. She gave me a gift more precious than I can ever imagine. You, my daughter. Because of you, a piece of me will always be by her side. Because of you, she will never be alone again. I'm sure you're with her right now, right? Make sure you give her a hug for me, okay? Thank you. We went to the U.S. six years later, but a piece of my heart stayed with somebody else back home. [man speaks Mandarin] This is my special one, Huiliang. [sniffles] When I told your mother about Huiliang, she just nodded like she always knew. So when the doctor told me I only had a little while left to live, she gave me another gift I never expected. She gave me my freedom. She knew this meant I would have even less time to spend with her. And I realized this also meant that I could never see you born, daughter. I still don't know if I made the right choice. Xiao Wei, you need to know that your baba loved you very, very much. [sighs] Because... even if my story ends... [Emma sniffling] ...that is when yours will begin. [sobbing] When I saw your father the day he was born, I knew he was special. And I couldn't just leave Mary there all on her own. But you did when she was no older than me. You should watch the tape with your mom. [Lily sighs] I'll be right back. I'll be right here. [dialing phone] [phone ringing] Hi, this is Emma. You know what to do. -If you don't, well... -[phone beeps] Emma. Hey. Um... Listen, we're worried about you. All of you. [phone ringing] [phone chimes] I just wanna say I think what you're doing for your grandmother is a beautiful thing, a gift, really. When you get this, I hope you'll reach out to your mom. That would be a nice gift too. I love you. Good night. [phone chimes] [♪] -[♪] -[birds chirping] [water running] -Hey. -[Karen] Hey. Breakfast first. Then we go. So, you didn't come back last night. I stayed with my grandma. Oh, is she okay? She's fine. And, um, are you okay? [Emma chuckles] I-- I just figured maybe you weren't comfortable -spending the night with me anymore. -Karen. We are best friends, Karen. That hasn't changed. It's just this... It's from my dad. Oh. Well, what did he say? A lot of things. Grandma said I should watch it with my mom. Guess I'll have to find a VCR someplace. [zipper zips] -[classical music playing] -[chatter] -Morning. -[Emma] Good morning. Where's Karen? Said she had to go do something. -Pancakes? -Yes, thanks. Thank you. [phone ringing] -Mmm, that smells good. -Where have you been? You'll see. But first, pancakes. This is for you. A VHS player. Bob said he saw it in a thrift shop up the street. So you can watch the tape with your mom. [♪] Oh, Garlic World. Let's stop. [Emma chuckling] Really? You want to stop and smell the garlic? Garlic is always very good for the blood. You always say that. Don't you? [laughter] [Karen] I love garlic. Clearly. [laughter] Charlotte, you have to eat something. If you smell like garlic-- [burps] [chuckles] Emma Carter, did I not to teach you anything? Ew. -Okay, we'll share. -Grandma, let's go look around. Wait, wait, we should finish these fries. -[Emma] Bye. -[Karen] Bye. [Emma] You watched the tape. That's why you didn't give it to me on my birthday. It didn't slip your mind. I didn't want you to hate me or see me as selfish. You know, leaving your mother behind almost broke me. You didn't break. And my mom suffered. When we first came here, life was very hard and it was such a struggle. It was doing her a favor. Okay, okay. Don't get so defensive. We are not going to Carmel only to watch the sunset, are we? [Lily laughing] It's got something to do with Mom. You're counting on Mom going there too, right? Right. Who else knows about my father? Oh, just your mother and I. Perhaps Brian too. Keeping secret takes a toll. Maybe I have a secret. Oh? Some things are private, you keep to yourself. And some things are secrets. And secrets are no good for families. So what is yours? There's a boy I like. [chuckles] His name is Rick. He's Black. I'm not sure how Mom's gonna feel about that. Oh, don't worry about your mother. How do you feel? Well, when I see him, I get, um, I get these butterflies in my stomach. [laughs] Got butterflies? But he thinks we're just friends. Does he know how you feel about him? No. Is he supposed to read your mind? Well, what if I'm wrong? What if he doesn't like me the same way? Have you not heard your father's tape? You know, he was doing everything to please others at first, and that's how I got you. And I'm very grateful because I'm a selfish woman. [Emma chuckles] But later, he was very brave and he did what he wanted and be really with the one he loves. And I'm very glad he did it. Aren't you? Yeah. Just follow the butterflies. They always fly to the right direction. I don't want you to die. [laughs] You think I have a choice? [Lily laughing] -Oh, will you look at this? -It's so beautiful! -It's just as I remember. -It's so cool. -[Charlotte] All right. -[Emma] Isn't that beautiful? Are we ready for our picnic? -Oh, no time for that. -What? What are you talking about? Are you not feeling well? Of course not. I'm 88 and I have COPD. All right. We're gonna go to the hospital then. Oh, no, no, no. We go shopping. That outfit of yours just won't do. [chuckles] Won't do for what? We'll get something in town, yeah. -[Emma laughing] -Let's just go shopping. Stop blathering. Come on, go. -It's a seal. -Oh, so beautiful. -I guess we're going shopping. -Oh, we're go-- -Oh, let's go shopping. -We are going shopping. Ah, shopping. [laughs] -[Charlotte] Come along. -Okay, we gotta go. We gotta go. [Charlotte] Karen, I can drive. [Mary] Here, here. Try here. [Brian] Okay. [Mary sighs] Not here. They-- they have to be here. My mother told me again and again that she wanted to come here one last time. Maybe they're just not here yet. But what if... Oh, God. What if she took a turn for the worse? -What if they were in the-- -Mary. If anything like that had happened, Emma would've called us. I'm sure of it. Don't worry. Where are they? [chatter, laughter] [Lily] Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, look, look. That dress would look good on you. On... [chuckles] Oh, please. Where would I wear something like that? For your audition for America's New Voice. It's happening here tonight. What? [Lily] You always said you always want to sing in a live audience and life never gave you the chance. So, life finally came through. But how? [Lily] I signed you up online. Oh, come on. You don't even know how to use a smartphone. -How could you do that? -[chuckling] Oh... Alice, the 80-year-old geek. Die, alien scum. Ah, I got ya, I got ya. -Alice. -There you go. My application, have you did it or not? Almost. Don't get your boxers in a bunch. Can't you see I'm working here? Ah. Oh, there goes my retirement. Oh, and the Bitcoin's gone. What? You remember her. At Paradise Corners. [hiccups] Oh, this is silly. I-- It's impossible. I can't. Oh, you always said life never gave you the chance. Now you have a chance and you are not singing? You're a coward? Oh, maybe you are not as good as you said you are. -Hmm. -Mm? -Mm? -Hmm-hmm. All right. All right. -I'll do it. -[Karen squeals] What-- What's with the hiccups? Uh, it's the garlic. Oh, look. Emma. That dress will look good on you. I don't need a new dress. I'm your grandmother. If I say I want to buy you a new dress, I'm buying it, and you just say thank you. -[Emma] Oh, thank you. -[laughter] [woman] ♪ Silent night ♪ ♪ Holy night ♪ -♪ All is calm... ♪ -Two minutes. Oh, Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. [sighs] -[hiccups] -Water. You need water. My dad says try holding your breath and taking ten swallows in a row. No. [hiccups] Maybe we should try scaring her. -[Karen laughs] -Sometimes it works. Charlotte. I'm dying. Stop it. I'm already scared. None of that will work. This is why I didn't try it for a career. Because every time I walk on to the stage... [hiccups] Why didn't you say something? Oh, it's too embarrassing. Okay, it's time for Charlotte Kelly and Emma Carter. [Emma chuckling] What? Emma Carter? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A duo. You signed me up too? That is so manipulative. You should take a risk. Karen, did you know about this? Um, maybe. Maybe not. I didn't know any about this, but come out there with me. We sing so well together. [Lily] You always say you don't know what to do with your life. Remember what your father did. [applause] [woman] Charlotte Kelly, Emma Carter, why do you two think you should be a America's new voice? Because this is Charlotte. -[applause] -She's from Ireland. And my grandmother and my mom are from China. My little brother, half and half. Tonight, Hollywood comes to Carmel. [Mary] This martini is the biggest ever. -Look at this glass. -[Brian] Huh? But, you know, I think the bartender, I think he's watering down the vodka. Okay, hon. -[Emma] I've got... -[bartender] One more? ...a crazy family. But we are a family when it counts.

[siren wailing] -Mom? -[Mary] Emma? I'm so sorry I-- She'll be okay. Shame on you, Charlotte. Allowing my mother to manipulate you like this? Manipulate me? We came up with this plan together. Sort of. The singing part was a surprise. You should have informed me. You should have listened to your mother. [woman] Excuse us. She loves this place. All of the memories, that rock. You don't know the whole story. Hi. I'm Dr. Conrad. Are you Mrs. Wu's daughter? Yes. Well, your mother is stable now. Oh, thank God. Vitals are good considering her condition. Looks like a pretty clear case of dehydration exacerbated by her running out of supplemental oxygen. [Charlotte] She ran out of oxygen? I'll check on her later. Will you give us a second? Thank you. Honey. This is what your mother wanted. She lived a good life. Who are we to disrespect her at the end? What about my time with her? What if this is... What if I hadn't gotten a chance to say goodbye? It's okay. It's all right. You have some time left with her. Make good use of it. I'm gonna call David. -I'm gonna check on my mother. -Okay. Are you gonna be okay though? -They're gonna take care of her. -Right. But are you gonna be okay with them? Okay, look, um, my dad is meeting me at a hotel. -Oh. -But it's only 10 minutes away. Mm. [Mary] Once she's stable, I want her home. No more hospitals or facilities. -Okay. -Not so fast. Mom. It's all my fault. Oh, it's my own fault. You know, when I ran out of oxygen, I thought-- Oh, never mind what I thought. You're gonna feel better, Mom. You just need more rest. Oh, I can rest when I'm dead, but I don't want to die in this kind of room full of machines. You do know what I mean? [ringing] [phone ringing] Oh, hey, you. [laughs] Sorry to wake you up. Oh, no, no, don't be. Um, I'm just glad to see your face and know that you're okay. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm good. I really am. Just been a crazy couple of days. -[chuckles] -I saw you on TV. That's-- Whoa, that's-- that's awesome. Was that part of the whole mission? A part of it, yes. And there's a lot more. Okay, well, I want to hear all about it. What are you doing tomorrow? Uh, Saturday? Nothing planned. What's up? I want you to meet someone special, my grandmother. She's a big part of this mission. Sure, I'd-- I'd love to. And you'd have to come to Carmel. I can do that. That's cool. And there's one more thing. Rick, do you wanna go to prom with me? [Rick laughing] Wow, you-- you know how long I've been waiting for you to ask that? Well, the guy's supposed to ask. Oh, no, but that's so 2015. [laughs] So, is that a yes or a no? Um... -That's a yes. [chuckles] -[chuckles] So just text me the details about Carmel, and I'll see you tomorrow. You have a good night. You too. Night. [phone beeps] Yes! [woman on P.A.] Dr. Roberts, two, seven, four, four. Dr. Roberts, two, seven, four, four. Come. We need to talk about what's next. What's next? After I'm gone. [sighs] Do we have to talk about that? Come. You know, you have to forgive your mother. I already have. Good. No matter how American you are, you're still Chinese. In our culture, the bond between mother and daughter is profound. Okay. Then what about you and mom? Oh, I love your mother so much it hurts. -Does she know that? -Of course. That's why she put me in the best, best place to stay and she didn't want me to come to Carmel because she's afraid of losing me. Losing me will break her heart. She's not as strong as you are. I'll take care of her. And also, about Brian. You must be an ally to Brian when it comes to dealing with your mother. But you just said my mom needs me. Oh, you know how your mother could be. And Brian isn't from our village. [Emma chuckles] I'm gonna miss you. Butterfly, that's what we are. Here for one season and then gone. Butterflies. Mm-hmm. [parking brake clicks] [man] Excuse me, where's the emergency room? My mom's... [Ben] Wow. I don't blame Grandma for wanting to come out here. It's way nicer than L.A. Don't let her catch you saying that. That's a whole other drama. -[Eddie] No! -Uh-huh. Yeah. I can pay to fix it if you want. My van! Yeah. And this and this. -Don't forget this part either. -[laughs] Do-- do you know what this means? Uh... no. Emma's grandmother had me write it. It means, more or less, uh, "Let me go. Let me be free. Let me be me." [♪] Why didn't you tell me the truth about my dad? [Mary sighs] -I was trying to protect you. -By lying to me? It wasn't totally a lie. He is dead. Mom, that's not what I meant. Okay, I'm sorry I didn't tell you the truth. Can we not fight about this? But why? Were you afraid I'd turn out the same way? Then maybe I should be a lesbian in his honor. [chuckles] I'm joking, Mom. Sometimes I find your sense of humor quite odd. Well, I think I get it from you. Mom, your hands are clean. Trust me. I'm sorry I called you a control freak. And I'm going to prom with a Black guy, Rick. I like him. A lot. I hope it's not a problem for you. Why would you think such a thing? 'Cause you're so complicated. Emma, I want you to be happy. If Rick makes you happy, then I'm happy. Is that so complicated? A woman of grace, loving and giving. That's what my dad called you. When he told me, I was devastated. I thought I had done something wrong. He gave me a beautiful gift. You. Hearing his voice, seeing his face, meant the world to me. When we get home, let's watch the tape together. I would like that. I would like that very much. Okay. Now it's your turn. Tell me why you don't like Carmel, why you don't want Grandma to be here. Could you ask me to do something next time, Grandma? [chatter, laughter] [Charlotte] Now we know where Karen gets it. -[laughter] -[Karen] I agree. Do you want to have another singing contest? Emma. Mary. [Mary] Here. Come. Grandma says this rock, they had it brought to the beach from your property, a special place. "Victor loves Lily Lee." My Chinese name. It means "beautiful." I think that's romantic. So, why is that complicated? [Mary] After they settled in Carmel, your grandmother spent a lot of time on this beach. For six years. Blaming herself for leaving me behind. Your grandfather would find her taste the ocean water saying it had my tears in it. With her fingernails, she tried carving my name on this rock until her fingers bled. Your grandfather pretended not to notice. Then he secretly finished the carving for her. Why would I ever bring her here to relive all that pain? Mom, Grandma wants us all to be here. It's not about pain. It's about love. I love her so much. It hurts. That's exactly what she said about you. I wish I could hear her saying that. [both laughing] So maybe we should turn this rock into a happy place, make it our rock. Put my name on it, Mom. [Brian] You remember when we met? You were just six years old, little girl. All you spoke to me was in Chinese. Yeah. Mom only wanted me to speak in Chinese. That's a really cool thing though. She taught you her language. You speak your parents' language. -That's a real gift. -I guess so. [woman] Excuse me. She taught me how to say "baobei." Her treasure. -Remember that? -Yeah. I remember what I did to you the first time you called me that. Yeah. You spit on me. Twice. The next day too. And then you threw up in my car. [chuckles] Yuck. Sorry. It's all right. It was my fault, really. You know, I gave you too much chocolate cake. Who was I to say no to you? Honey. You know how proud of you I am? You helped me with my homework, corrected my English, made me pancakes, taught me how to drive without actually running people over, taught me how to floss the correct way. You know what that makes you? My dad. You never called me that before. Is it too late to start? [clears throat] As long as you keep flossing correctly? [Emma laughs] No. -[Emma laughing] -Yeah? [chatter, laughter] [Rick clears throat] [Charlotte] Look. Someone's here for you. Hello. Hey, I'm sorry I'm late. Traffic was crazy. No problem. So, guys, this is Rick. And, Rick, here's my crazy family. That includes Charlotte, Karen, and her father. -Wow. -And, um-- Hello. Nice to meet you, crazy family. This is my dad. Hey. -Hey, Rick. -Nice to meet you. You too, sir. Join us, please. -Thank you. -Yeah. -Come on. -[chatter] Dumpling for you, chopsticks for you, good sir. You've got to have some of these. This one has been sitting here all day. [♪] [Mary exhales] [speaking Mandarin] [Mary chuckles] [both laughing] [Emma] What's so funny? We were just talking about who is more of a dragon lady, me or her. [chuckles] That's a tough one to answer. This is Rick. -Hi. -Hi. Rick? -Oh, you can play that thing. -Yeah. Yeah. And you know, I should have signed you up for the audition too. Grandma. [laughs nervously] [laughs] I'm just joking. [Rick and Lily chuckle] Nice meeting you, Rick. Oh, it's an honor to meet you, Miss Wu. Emma here has said a lot of great things about you. When it comes to her grandmother, she's a little biased. [laughs] [Rick laughs] Go on. Have a nice time. Follow the butterfly and don't stay with a dying fossil. [Lily chuckles] Okay. You know, Mary... [speaking Mandarin] [kisses] [Mary] Dr. Conrad, may I speak with you please? [Dr. Conrad] Yes. I want to remove my mother from the hospital. No more tests. Can't allow that. Her medical directive gives me the right to make that decision. It's my duty. It's my duty to take care of my patients in case anything happens to her. What's happening to her is that she's dying. -Ma'am, I-- -Doctor. Is your mother alive? -Yes. -Do you love her? Of course. Then when it's her time, remember this conversation.
