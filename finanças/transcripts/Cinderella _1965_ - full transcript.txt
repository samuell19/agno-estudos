( overture playing ) We are in sight of the towers of home and your father's palace, Your Highness. It hardly seems we have been gone an entire year. I've sent messengers ahead to tell of your arrival. I am dying of thirst. Let us stop at that cottage. ( music playing ) What do you suppose is wrong with yon wench? Doubtly she's overwhelmed at the sight of Your Royal Highness. In my present dusty and exhausted state, I doubt that I could overwhelm anyone. Aide: She is peering at us through the windows. Come out, lass. Prince: Come out, lass. Come out. We will not harm you. I dare not. Why not? No one is at home and my stepmother will beat me if I speak to anyone while she's away. Where has she gone? She has gone with my stepsisters into the town to welcome the prince who's returning today from fighting dragons and rescuing princesses and... finding his true love. Ahh. Is that what he was doing? Now, would you be a kind lass and fetch me a dipper of cool water from your well before I die of thirst? Oh, of course, sir. And, uh, you need say nothing of it to your stepmother. The poor slavey does not recognize Your Highness and she is terrified of her stepmother. But her kindness has overcome her fear. Here you are, sir. Thank you, lass. More? No. Thank you most kindly. You are most kindly welcome, sir. What is your name, lass? I am called Cinderella. Cinderella. Why are you called that? Because I sit among the ashes. - And why do you do that? - To warm my feet. You see, sir, I sleep in the attic where it is always cold. Then why do you sleep in the attic? The other rooms are occupied by my stepmother and my stepsisters. Where does your father sleep? In Heaven. Shall we go on, Your Highness? Yes. Good-bye, Cinderella. ( horse hooves departing ) G-good-bye... Your Highness. ( horse hooves fading ) "Fighting dragons, rescuing princesses "and finding his true love." But I have not found my true love. That is unfortunate, Your Highness. It is not for lack of seeking, you will grant me that. Perhaps Your Highness did not tarry long enough with any of the princesses you rescued. There was no need to tarry. When she appears, I will know.

Well, couldn't you find anything else to do, child? - No, ma'am. - Here. Take care of these things. Oh, dear. I'm exhausted. But it has been a wonderful day. Simply wonderful. Oh, yes, it was so thrilling to see the prince return. - He is so handsome. - And so gallant. - And so polite. - How would you know? Oh, I've heard it said. Now, my daughters, I want to talk to you. Not you. My own daughters. Yes, ma'am. Now that the prince has returned from his travels, it'll be time for him to marry. Esmerelda: I wonder who will be the lucky girl. Prunella: Imagine marrying the prince. Well, there's no reason why it cannot be one of you. Yes, why not? Did you see the way he smiled and waved at me? I was under the impression it was I he smiled and waved at. You were always a little nearsighted. - But I was never fat. - I am considered pleasingly plump! And I have been told my eyes are dreamlike! Now, now, there is room for improvement in both of you. You, Esmerelda, simply must learn to stop batting your eyes. It was quite all right up to the age of six. I keep forgetting. Watch it! And you, Prunella-- - Yes, Mother? - Your knee creaks. - I cannot help it, Mother. - Yes, you can. Rub some unicorn oil into it. Whoever hopes to marry the prince must be perfect. So upstairs, both of you, and work on yourselves. Perhaps some day, if you are lucky, Cinderella, you too may catch a glimpse of the prince. Oh, I hope so. Did anyone call while we were away? - Yes, ma'am. - Who was it? Only a traveler who stopped for a dipper of water. And you gave it to him? Yes, ma'am. I told you never to open that door while we were away! He was so thirsty... and his smile was so kind. Go to your corner! And stay there till you are called. Yes, ma'am. ( orchestral music playing ) I don't mind staying in my corner.

I am ready to do my duty, Father, but whom shall I marry? There's not one maiden in my kingdom who wouldn't be happy to be your bride. Many of them are very lovely. We should give a ball, my dear, and invite all the young ladies of fashion so that you may make your choice. - A splendid idea. - ( bell rings ) I would really rather wait until I fall in love. - Love? - Yes, sir. But we cannot leave a matter of such importance to mere chance. Your father is right, my dear. It is quite possible that love will follow. Perhaps. Your majesty?

Well, at least I hope you prepared some fascinating opening remark for the prince. Something that will attract his attention and make a striking first impression. - Yes, ma'am, I have. - What is it?

Oh, Fairy Godmother, I am wishing it so very, very hard that if all the wishes of all the girls who ever wanted to go to a ball turned into one big wish, it would not be any harder than my wish. That's hard enough. Now... you will need a coach, four horses, a coachman and a groom. But is it possible to get those things by wishing for them?

Let's take them out to the garden, shall we? Yes, Fairy Godmother. Come. Put them by the pumpkin. Now, we still need a coachman and a groom. Let me see... ooh! There's something peering at us out from under that shrub. ( giggles ) It's a fine, fat rat with whiskers and his brother. They'll do very nicely for the coachman and the groom.

And here are your slippers. Oh! They're made of glass. They fit perfectly. Now you are ready for the ball. But there is one thing you must remember. You must leave before the stroke of midnight for the magic will last no longer.

Oh...uh... very nice weather we're having for this time of year. You really should not make such very personal remarks, you know. Oh, dear. Forgive me, Your Highness. My mother told me to say something personal to you. I shall send you back to your mother for further instruction. I'm pleased to see the ball is such a success, my dear. It is indeed, my dear, with everyone, except the prince. Except the prince? He does not seem to be enjoying himself very much. Why not? With all the fairest young maidens of my kingdom here, he has only to choose among them. Ah, there is the rub. If only he did not have to choose.

Thank you, my dear. Uh-- uh... Your Highness. Yes? Uh-- uh-- Are you preparing to say something or are you just clearing your throat? I'm preparing to say something, Your Highness, something personal. I have already been told about the weather. That was my sister. Ah, yes. And what personal remark do you wish to make?

I am fatigued. Yes, Your Highness. ( creaks ) Your Highness. Madam. May I say, Your Highness, that I've never seen a finer-looking couple than Your Highness and that young lady you were just dancing with. Which young lady is that? My daughter Prunella. Ah, yes. May I say, Your Highness, that she's been brought up with no expense spared, having received instruction in etiquette, lawn croquet, heraldry, and pomp and circumstance. Ah, yes. I noticed the pomp. Oh, did you really? But, madam, she has a circumstance that I cannot abide. What is that, Your Highness? She creaks. Your Highness. Madam. My other daughter. Which one is that? Esmerelda. Ah, yes. She bats her eyes. Well! There's simply no pleasing that prince. ( fanfare ) ( ballroom music in distance ) Coachman: Cinderella. Remember what your fairy godmother said. You must leave before the stroke of midnight. I will remember. Why have you left the dance, my boy? I am fatigued. Fatigued? At your age? I am certain it is not the dance that has fatigued him, my dear. That is the truth, Mother. I am discouraged. Discouraged? With all the fairest young maidens of my kingdom here? It would not be so bad if I saw them as fair young maidens. How else do you see them? As contenders for a prize. And I am the prize. ( fanfare ) Who is she? I do not know. My, she is beautiful. Carries herself well. Do you not think so, dear? Dear! ( music playing ) Who on earth is she? I never saw her before. The prince has a foolish expression on his face. He never looked that way when he danced with me. No. Thank you most kindly for the dance. You are most kindly welcome, Your Highness.

Yes! Thank you, dear Fairy Godmother! Your highness! Your highness! What is it, miss? You have traveled far. You are sad and weary and thirsty. Here is a dipper of cool water from the well. Thank you, lass. More? No. Thank you most kindly. You are most kindly welcome, Your Highness. We have spoken these words before. Yes, Your Highness. Not only here, but in a moonlit garden. Yes, Your Highness. Cinderella! What are you doing? Silence!
