All right, class is over. You finished first. Why'd you take it twice? I am and the... Hi. Whoa! Slow down. You don't gotta run. You are all good. Have a seat. You are good. As I was saying, I'm Coach Pete. I'm the novice rowing coach, and I presume you guys are all here for the Wellington Novice Rowing Program. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay, so, let's hear why all of you came to fly with the Ravens. Yeah? All right, we'll go from the top. You, "caw." Uh, some lady coach emailed me and asked me to try out. Said something about scholarships if you make it to sophomore year. Okay, well, it's traditionally very hard to move up to varsity, but, I mean, I personally would love to see all of you guys move up, but in the meantime, I think we should all... probably learn how to row, and just have some fun, yeah? Okay. You, "caw." Caw. Like that? Good. Kidding. Um, I thought it'd be like, a good way to, like, make friends. Friends. Why are you here? - Um... - Oh, here they are. Say hi, everybody. They're here to help us today. The captain, Highsmith, and the powerhouse of the 1V, Janssen. All right, so most of you guys have been to the gym, right? And you've seen how the bros row. Show 'em. That's a bro row. All right? That's a one-way ticket to a herniated disc. We don't want that. Janssen, show 'em how it's done. Look at that. You guys see the difference? She's using her legs. So most people think rowing is about arms. Those people are wrong. It's legs and back, right? Correctamundo, Brill It's 60 to 70 percent lower body. Look at her rhythm. Same way. Every time. See that? Legs, body, arms, arms, body, legs. Legs, body, arms, arms, body, legs. In rhythm. Legs, body, arms, arms, body, legs. You see that? It's the same every time. - Body, arms... - Say it with me. Legs, body, arms, arms, body, legs. Legs, body, arms, arms, body, legs. - That's it. - Legs, body, arms, arms, body, legs, - Legs, body... - And you. Hit the lost and found. I'm sorry, you can't row in that. Yeah? Okay. Let's go. Good. Let's go! Step by step. Row. Good. Posture. A little desperate. Loose. Raven claws. Raven... Legs first. Body then legs. Body, arms. Line up to the bra strap. Legs, body, arms. That's groovy. Backwards. Arms, body, legs. Legs, body, arms. Arms, body, legs. Golden. Weigh enough. Weigh enough. Weigh enough then stop. I mean, there's a better way to do that, but, you know. Okay, guys! It's 10,000 hours to be an expert. Right now we'll focus on 10,000 strokes, yeah? Cement it! Legs, body, arms. ...body, arms. Yesterday, I just woke up and I had this epiphany. Like, everyone here was the top of their high school. We're all, like, the same, you know? Like big fish in a small pond. Mm-hm. And I know your mom's happy that we're rooming together. And, I mean, I'm so excited, we've been dreaming about it since, like, sixth grade. Body, legs, arms. Body, legs, arms. Welcome, novice. This is your boat house. These are the eights over here, fours over in bay five. We got the singles, we'll get into that later in the year. But dive right in. ... cox. I get it. It's funny. That is your one laugh. You used it up, guys. There are a lot of funny words in rowing. There's cox. Shaft. Crab. Excuse me. There's crabs in the lake? No. Catching a crab... is rowing's version of a fumble. It's, uh, you lose control of the oar, it could knock your teeth out. It could literally fling a girl off the boat. It's no joke. Okay. Erin is the 2V cox. She'll be with us today. She is your eyes out there because you are literally rowing ass backwards. She steers the boat, she does the race plan, yada, yada. She's the furthest thing from just a cheerleader. Up to shoulders. Ready? Up. Walk down. Watch your step. And the tree. Watch the dock! All right, feet to the edge. Sorry, excuse me, it's just... it's raining, - so maybe we could... - Novice, I just said it's a water sport, so you will get wet. Up and over head. Ready? Up. Down and into water. Ready? Down. Careful. Graceful, novice. Don't put a hole in the boat, it costs 50K. Sure you don't want to go back to the novice stand? Fifty fucking K for a boat? Fifty K's, like, their allowance. They don't even give a shit. It's raining again. Ports, get the oars, starboards, the oarlocks. What? Just the seat? You just do it on the seat? - Hands on the dock. - Oh, I got it. Lean away. Push. Oars! Arms, body, legs! Legs, body, arms! Arms, body, legs! Okay, that... that's my fault. No... No baggy clothes, people! Okay? It's like meant to be. Also, those IV girls are, like, so nice. Don't you think? You mean 1V. Yeah, yeah. Well, that's what I said, 1V. Well, if you make the 1V, you get a full scholarship, so better watch out because I'm comin' for it. Right. Yeah. - But I'm... I'm serious. - Right. I made starting varsity in two sports in high school. I mean, you're like the best novice out of all of us, so you probably have the best chance out of all of us. Yeah. Also, did you know Coach Edwards was novice and she, like, became an Olympian, so... I don't give a shit about the Olympics. - Look where it got her. - Right. Yeah, she's coaching a third rate team. At a school where no one even knows we have a rowing team. Right. Yeah, I don't care either. I need a scholarship, so I'm staying. Yeah, I mean, like, you're like the best novice. I mean, you're like the best novice out of all of us. Scholarship, scholarship, scholarship... The best novice. So you probably have the best chance out of all of us. Rhythm, rhythm, rhythm. Last 30 seconds. Let's go! Nice, Brill. Smooth. Steady. That's what we like, ladies. Steady. Steady, steady. Rhythm. Rhythm is everything. Having fun, Zucker? Making friends, rowing boats. Nice, ladies. Timing... ...is everything. Good job. Hey, guys, take a walk, grab a drink. Take a break. Sit. Jamie. You played volleyball or basketball? Both. I knew it. You're a natural. High 1:30s, low 1:40s. - You did pretty good, then. - Put it this way. Over the course of a 2,000 meter race, if you get a 2 flat and they get a 1:59.2, they've beaten you by a full boat length. Races are won and lost by 100ths of a second. Technique wins and loses races. - Uh... - You don't have to raise your hand. So the varsity, they do this workout a lot? Today they did the same workout as you. Six times, and then they hit the weights. Okay, guys, next Friday is your first 2K ERG test baseline. What's a good time for that? What's your name again? - Alex Dall. - Al... Dall, yeah, um... take the average of your 500 meter time, multiply them by four, and then just add... ten to 20 seconds. How well do you think I did today? - Well, you did great. - Okay. 'Cause I could do better. How well did you think you did? I think I did... Arms, body, legs. Legs, body, arms. Arms, body, legs, Legs, body, arms. The party looks kinda shitty. You sure it's supposed to be good? - They seem nice. - What, a nice frat? Okay, we can still go back. - No, we're not going back. - Watch out, watch out. Excuse me, excuse me. Party up! - There's not much left. - Okay. Drink the rest of it. More. One more. One more. You're good. Let's do it. Oh, my God. Slow. Slow, slow. - Shit, I think the condom slipped off. - What?! I literally had to fish it out. Probably the worst I ever had, so over eager. Well, was he like bigger... or, like, less so? You know the cliche. It's not about the... size of the boat, more about the motion in the ocean. Well, maybe the second time will be better. Are you kidding me? I just wanted to get the drunk college one night stand out of the way. Check. Done. Next. Okay, well, positives. You got to sleep in your own bed. I slept on the floor of some sorority girl's room. What? Nothing. - You're processing. - I'm not processing. I'm just trying to figure something out. Yeah, that's processing. Mindfulness. - Okay, relax. - I'm relaxed. Okay, 'cause you really shouldn't be stressed about school. You were the smartest in our high school. I'm not stressed about school and I worked the hardest. - There's a difference. - Whatever. Just remember, a 90 and 100 are both 4.0s in college. Okay? I was worried about you senior year. Speaking of weird. Sorority, really? I mean, they were kind of cool, actually. Now, I think I judged them before really getting to know them. Hey. Jamie. What's up? You took it three times today. Find any mistakes? - Always. - Here's your last quiz. See you next week. - Where are the answers? - Please don't argue with the grade. - I'm not arguing with the grade. - Office hours are Monday. after fall break. Do you want me to email the professor for the answers? - 'Cause I can do that. - Well, maybe I should thank you. Thank me? why? All this time I spent waiting on you, I finished my applications early. To the school of rock? Doctor programs. Astrophysics. Top choice is U. of Chicago, led by Dr. Friedman. She calculated the age of the universe. Do you want me to pretend to be impressed? It's freshman year. Take if from someone who's been in your shoes. Overdoing it. Physics is my worst subject, so I... I kind of have to overdo it. Aren't you a physics major? Okay. I just need the answer key. 13.7 billion years. - What? - Age of the universe. I think it puts your meaninglessness into perspective. - I'll see you after break. - You know, let me take you out sometime. Make it up to you for all of the time of yours I've wasted. I'm a TA, I don't go out with my students. What are you doing? Getting the answer key. Thank you! - Late! - I know. Hey, Brill. What are you looking at? See what time I have to get to make varsity. You're not gonna do the time that coach recommended? No. I wasn't really trying that hard, so I don't think it's very accurate. 7:59 seems doable. 7:59, 7:59. 7:59. 7:59. 7:55, Dall. Not bad. 7:49, Brill. You two are on a roll. Good job, novice. Up, ladies, up! In the words of Unk, "walk it out." Shit. Good job, Dall. Just take your time. You earned it. See you in the weight room. Let's go, ladies. - Okay, thank you. - Okay. We learned a lot. Thank you. Bye. Leave your sweatshirt. Dall. Rowing is not for everyone. It's a big time commitment. Not everyone is willing to go the extra mile. But I am, so if you could just give me a chance on anything. I mean, I... I could even maybe stay after or later... No, no, relax, relax. My point is, uh, Regatta in one week. I thought it was three... three weeks. No, no, the novice Regatta in three weeks. The varsity is in one week. We are making a fresh four and I don't got enough varsity to, uh, fill it, so you'll start practicing with the team in the mornings, if you want, every day for the next week. - Me? - Yeah, you. If you want. Look, it's twice as much work as you're doing now, you gotta be there at the lake at 5 a.m. every day. And plus, the Regatta overlaps with fall break, and frankly, that pisses a lot of girls off. - so I don't want... - I don't care. I don't care, I can... I can do that. I can to that. I... I'd love to do that. Awesome sauce. Good. Get outta here. Scooch. The only novice to get moved up to varsity. Yeah. Well, double. They practice at 5 a.m. 5 a.m.? I thought practices were in the afternoons. Varsities do, uh, two days. - Okay. - When are you supposed to, like, sleep? Yep. Okay. I love you. Bye. Hey. What's up? Yo, um... I'm gonna go to bed soon, but do you want to carpool tomorrow? Um... I... I actually am gonna be practicing with the varsity tomorrow. Duh! That's what I mean. Me too. Coach Pete told me you're the other novice moving up. You wanna, uh, meet outside Turner Hall at 4:30? Yeah. Okay. Cool. Cool. Maybe we got the time wrong? The email definitely said 5 a.m. What if they're fucking with us? God, this better not be some hazing shit. You and me have to stick together. Um... why would they be fucking with us? Uh, because varsity does not want fresh meat nipping at their heels. And all the other novices, they're just like, "Oh, yeah, a fun intramural. Ooh, ducks. Ooh, friends." We actually need this shit. God, when Coach Pete reached out to me and basically said I was gonna get a scholarship, I mean, I'm not religious but, like, fuck. Also, Rachel's such a little bitch, she didn't give a shit when they offered her the spot. She just booked a flight for fall break. It's probably first class, too. Silver spoon bitch. Honestly, your lucky break, though. They offered the spot to Rachel? Yes. But, honestly, it's her loss. And you try way harder than her, so... Sure as shit need it more than her, too. These novices are gonna drop like flies. I know it. I just... know it. Try-hard? Gone. Rachel? Gonna be gone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah? It's so much better doing it with another person. You know? Way more fun. We got this. You know? Oh! Let's go. You're late, novice. Yeah, sorry, we were just... Freshman four, over here. All right, we're doing novice sandwiches this week. Moore, four. Dall, you're three. You've rode starboard before, right? Yeah, I've rode starboard before, and port, so I can do both. Whichever one you want. So, Dall three. Mitchell, two. Brill, you got bow, okay? All right, hurry the fuck up and grab the boat. I'm stuck with you dumbasses this week. Don't piss me off. Anyone see lightning? No? Well, friggin' tell me if you do. I'm not getting electrocuted for a freshman boat. Stern pair, pick drill. Ready? Row. Whoa, wait up. All right, novice, pick drill. First arms, then arms and bodies, then quarter side, half side, full side. Got it? Okay. Ready? Row. All four, watch your hands! - Jesus Christ. - ...in full. And two. One. Two. Jesus, novice, you're turning the whole boat. Light strokes. Lightly. You know what? Fuck it, fuck it, wait up. Check it down. Lightly. All right, enough of that. Bow pair. Get ready. Row! Get that up. That is what I'm talking about. That's what it looks like. See, she's a natural. The other one isn't. Three seat, set the boat. Novice in the back, behind the freshmen. Let's go. And then back, all the way. All right, no more shits on the bus, people. Thelma, I'm talking to you. I don't want to smell it. No. Novice in the back. Fuck you, we're a team. Am I right, guys? Come on. Come on! Let's go! - Water? - No, no, hold on. How'd it go today? Heard you caught a crab, huh? It happens. How was it, though? Today? Your first race? Well, considering it was my fault we lost, I... It's not the fault of the person who caught the crab. It means the technique on the entire boat is off. Not one person wins or loses a race. I think I just got tired and my oar slipped so... I couldn't frickin' feel my legs and, uh, just need to get stronger. Can you give yourself a break, please? When you focus on your technique for a bit, it'll come. And remember what I said. It's 10,000 hours to be an expert. You literally just started. Relax. Will you? I'm just gonna go to the bathroom. Right. Jesus Christ, move. Little people freeze faster. All right, bitch. Welcome, novice. Your first practice with varsity. Well, for most of you. Varsity, the novice will be practicing... - Hey, listen up. - Sorry. Please. Thank you. The novice will be practicing with us until the new year. I want you to set an example for them. All right. I want you to set an example for them. Show them how hard you work. Show them what it's like to fight for a 2K PR, and keep in mind, some of them might be moving up one day. They'll be part of your team, and your competition. It's a good motivation going into the new year. For everyone. All right. Put your stuff away, grab an ERG and warm up. Brill, do we got an issue today? - No. - Good. - Whoo! - Ready? Oh, my God, I was born ready. Long time, bro. Yeah. You ready? Yeah, I think so. That's my ERG. Novice in the back. Novice, in the back. Sorry, I... I didn't know. Just take some time, all right? - Pete! - All right. Fuck. We're going to the trainer, novice. Earth to Dall. You don't have to kill yourself in the last 2K of the semester. Coaches know everyone sucks this time of year. Still wasn't enough. You're never gonna get a seven minute 2K if that's what you think. You're just not built for it. Besides, you fuckin' PR'ed at 7:45. The best novice time. 7:45.5. And there are only five novice left. Well, assuming we do seat races, you'll probably end up in the 2V, anyway. A what? Fugh! Technique doesn't matter on the ERG, but it matters in the water. Hence, a seat race to tell who's actually making the boat move faster. Okay, so? Okay, so two people race against one another in fours, do one piece, then the people seat racing swap, but the rest of the crew stays the same, go again, run the numbers, blah and blah. So you're saying I need to seat race. Weirdo, chill. It's drama... Ew! Don't get piss on me. Seriously, it's drama fucking city. This girl in my high school got kicked off the team for trying to throw one. So, should I ask Edwards? I could ask for, like, next week. No, you don't demand shit from Edwards. Besides, I heard she does them every spring break to finalize lineups. - So that's my shot. - No. 2K ERG tests matter. The seat race, the dumbass around-the-lake rows. Edwards takes these tests really seriously. Just keep doing what you're doing. But, like, relax. Seat racers swap, rest of the crew stays the same... Seat racers swap, rest of the crew stays the same go again, run the numbers, blah and blah. You went through it three times. You've been here two hours and 44 minutes. I'm going home. I still have six minutes. Hey! You gotta know when to quit. Fuck! - Dall? - Hey, coach, hi. - I was just... - You were... Shouldn't you be stuffed in a library somewhere - studying right now? - Yeah. And there's a reason we don't have practices during exams. NCAA reasons, but, uh, I don't know, we care about you, too, at least I do. - Yeah. - You're a student athlete, Dall. Student comes first, so would you repeat after me. Student athlete. I'm a student athlete. I just did a 2K and a PR. Awesome sauce. Yeah, I'm just... I'm trying to get better. Before you do that, why don't you... Don't leave me hangin'. Weight adjusted, I guess it's, uh... - it's okay. - Weight adjusted? What? Where'd you learn that? Well, I figured... the force generated by a more powerful rower might be offset by their weight if their boat gets pushed into the water more by their weight. 'Cause the more surface area of the boat in the water, the more friction causes the boat to slow down. If there was a weight adjustment... Weight adjustment calculators. Look, don't focus on the numbers, okay? That is enough to drive me crazy. I... Um, yeah, well, I'm taking a winter mini-mester, so at least that way I can at least use the ERG room. I want to get stronger. Uh, I've got a tip for you, Dall. It's not all about strength. And are you using the ERG room 'cause you're taking a winter-mester, or are you taking a winter-mester just so you can use the ERG room? I don't even want to know if that's the answer. I... I want to do 2Ks every day this break. I will chain the ERG room shut. There's an ERG in the gym. Oh, my God, you're... a lot. Okay. Um... Maybe... Maybe you can spend some time on the single, work on some technique. I didn't know I was allowed to row during break. - I'll do it. - Well, usually, it's meant for experienced girls, and it's usually done in the summer, 'cause the boat's easy to flip. Okay, well, I'll be careful, I'll stay close to the dock. It's not me you gotta convince. Coach Edwards. She has to unlock the boat house. - Can't you do it? - No. I have in-law visitation duty, which is my own thing, but, anyway, no. She's the boss lady. And, uh, she lives walking distance to the boat house so, I don't know, why don't you shoot her a text. I'm sure she'll let you right in. Why am I not surprised to see you here during break? You're here. What are you doing Saturday? Why? Playing a little school of rock set at the historic Red Dog. You should stop by. I thought you don't date students. Who said it was a date? Yeah, Mom. Well, the plan is... is to drive in on Christmas Eve, and then I'm gonna go back on, uh, Christmas Day. Okay, well, the day after. Well... No, I'm good. Yeah. Well, why have you been talking to Winona? No. I'm going to bed right now. - ID. - Hm. Go. - Hi. - What can I get you? Um, can I get a vodka soda, please. Well, aren't you full of surprises. Are you of age? Uh, I'm in here, right? I invited you expecting you to get turned away at the door. Okay, then. Hey. Hey. I was just kidding. Just kidding. Well, kinda. - Five minutes. - Okay. - I'll see you after? - Okay. Thank you. All right, guys, so this next song is actually a new song we wrote. I hope you guys like it.

Thanks so much for, um, meeting me so early. I've been up since five. I just wanted to get some extra practice in since other girls are so much bigger than I am. No. Those. Okay. Look, have you even rowed a single before? 'Cause if not, you're gonna wait until we take 'em out as a team. No, I have. - I have. - Good thing. Water's cold. Shoot me a text when you're done. Let me know the boat's back safe. Cool. Mm, 'kay - You're late, Dall. - Yeah. You know, the girls who row in summer usually come later. Yeah, well, I have class at 9:30. So... Have you seen my umbrella? - No. - Okay. - Come in if you see lightning. - Okay! Late again, Dall? I'm here. You know, you could just give me the key. You don't need a key. Just slam the door. Look who's on time and dry. Shit. Sorry, I just thought it would be quicker if I came here. Opens the boat house. You're lookin' good out there. I didn't know you were watching. That's the point. Six a.m., Monday morning. I mean, why's he interviewing a whole bunch of deans at a dinner table or something. I can't get a word in edge... I don't know what I'm... - Hey. - Hi. How you doin'? Um, Alex, this is Dani, my TA. - It's a pleasure to meet you. - Hi. Nice to meet you. Yeah, you're both pursuing physics, right? I'm actually underage, so... Oh. Underage. Did you, uh, TA for my class last semester? Oh, the class was so big. And it's been so long. Well, the two of you should get acquainted. Alex is, uh, one of our presidential scholars. And Dani here just actually got into her top choice school. You did? Congratulations. Thank you. That's a sweet cardigan. Is this the line for the bathroom? Right. It's warm in here. What, do you like me now that you know I'm leaving? I'm just waiting for the bathroom. You don't date your students, so... there's also that. You're not my student anymore. Oh, you said you were good at this. So freshman year of high school my mother said that I should enroll in some honors classes so that way I could challenge myself, which was a huge mistake. Yeah, sure, Miss 4.0. You've seen what I have to do to get an A. - Valid. - Great. Okay. So I was about to transfer out, but there was this smart ass douchy future frat bro who was always talking about me. He would always finish first, and then humble brag about how he never studied. So obviously, when he asked me out, - I turned him down. - Oh, no. This one class, we got our grades back, and he saw mine, which was a C, and he goes, "If you took the regular class, then you would probably get an A." Oh, no he didn't. I decided, fuck him. I was gonna beat him on the next test. I was gonna turn it in first and I was gonna get the better grade, - so I studied my ass off and... - And beat him. Well, I got a C but I did turn it in first. And it hit me, like, if I was rushing and making all these mistakes, then surely he must too, because there's no way, no matter how smart this guy was, he didn't miss one. So the next time, I took my time. - And you beat him. - Uh, no. Well, I got... I got my first B in that class. Okay? But the next time, I double checked my work, I re-did the test, - and then... - You beat him. I tied him. The time after that... - You beat him. - Yes, I beat him! - It's your turn. - I know. Now, everyone knew that this guy was gonna graduate valedictorian, but he only took the minimum classes needed to graduate. Well, I took a full load of honors classes to weight my GPS. He didn't study, but I did. He was smarter, but I worked harder. - And you became valedictorian? - Still no. Some girl transferred in junior year, beat us both. But I did graduate salutatorian and he was third. Bumped off the podium entirely. So that's how it all began. Somebody pissed you off and you got revenge. You don't know how many people gave me high fives during graduation, okay? This guy irritated everyone. So it was about the high fives and standing at the podium? No? Come on, give me something. Well, why did we go to the moon? Oh, God. No, no, really, tell me. Why did we go to some lifeless rock? Come on. Don't break my heart. Wasn't it just some huge propaganda factory and ego trips, that way, we could prove as Americans that we were superior to the Russians? - Ooh. - Who even cares that we got there first? We had bigger shit to worry about. We had people starving, civil rights, wars. Okay? All we got out of it was a bunch of dead astronauts and huge deficit. It was totally pointless. I can't believe you're a physics major, and you're shit talking space travel. - Mm-hm. - The advancements of technology because of that. - Okay. - The sense of national pride. Mm-hm. Not that I give a shit about that. - Oh, no. - To test our limits as a species, to see if we could. What was it Kennedy said? We do it not because it's easy, - but because it's hard. - Yes! Wow. Just wow. - No, it's my turn. - No way. - Let me show you how to... - No. All right, ladies, welcome back after your winter break. And I don't care if you've been sitting on your asses for the last two weeks, you are about to get moving. Welcome to hell. All right, Janssen... You okay? Yeah, just, uh... just this little thing, no big deal. Hm? I said, nice to see a novice move up. Hey, Groundsman, Dall, what are we waiting for? It's practice. Let's go. Nice work, Groundsman and Dall. Everyone, this is the work ethic I'm after. Okay? The schools we're going up against are bigger, they've got more money, more rowers, but we can work harder. When you're doing it right, the oar will make a V from the back splash. Push before you pull. Guys, more of that. That's it! Alex. Okay, bring it up. Time! That's it, ladies! Move! Move! What do I do with this? All right. Let's go! Push it here! Yes! Paddle! Paddle! We won this one. Weigh enough, girls. Their silver spoon asses got soft, I guess. Coach is gonna have to seat our asses. Shut the fuck up! Who the fuck are you talking to? We just lost to 2V boat. Do you realize how embarrassing that is? Do you realize that? You know, my roommate's probably waking up hungover at her all-inclusive right now, and we've already worked out six hours. Anyone can party on spring break. Not us, apparently. Also, it's been four days and there have been no mention of seat races at all. That's fuckin' bullshit. Erin said that they'd be later this week. No. Coach can't accept that our reject boat beat her recruited stars. Also, Janssen said the only reason we won was because the cox charted a shit course. That's why we need a seat race. That way, we know for sure. Mm. Shut up, Janssen. Still here. Nice work today, stern pair. We were actually hoping that we'd get to seat race. Crews are always changing, so just, uh, keep up the good work. Get some sleep, eat well, and we'll see you dark and early. We beat the 1V in the scrimmage. Yes. The 1V had a few technical difficulties. But, uh, you two, you rode a really good race. And if there are technical difficulties on race day, then what, we lose? Why don't you keep your head in your boat where it belongs, and, uh, we'll worry about the rest, all right? Good? Fuck. It's bullshit. She fucking scouted me. She promised me that scholarship. - We'll get our chance. - No, I fucking need this, man. Like, I really need this right now. Don't know what the fuck I was thinking coming here. I'm a fucking idiot. If I don't get this, I have to transfer to a state school. I can't fucking live with my dad. I fucking can't. I should have tried out for basketball or something. And now there's no fucking time, and I thought this was a guarantee. And now some entitled bitches and fucking seniority bullshit are ruining my shot. Our fucking shot. I'm gonna say something to Highsmith later. Do you think that's a good idea? Why the fuck do I care? What have I got to lose? Absolutely nothing. She fucking graduates in a couple months. She doesn't need the 1V, we do. This one is my favorite. - Can we post it? - Yeah, if you want. Which one's your favorite? Um, I like this one. Larry looks great. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. All right, everyone, we have some news. Groundman is out. Whoa, what? That pain in her shoulder? Turns out, her collarbone's broken. It's been hurting her for weeks. This thing has been broken this whole time? Yeah, it's fucking insane. So, listen to your bodies, people. Where's Edwards at? All right, those of you who are not on the board, y'all are doing 60 minute run. The rest of you are in fours. Hands on. Hey. How are you? They were supposed to row the same in both races. There's no way to know if... They rowed hard for Brill, they rowed light for me. They wanted me to lose. - Fuck this. - Dall, come here. - I heard them all talking. - Dall... - They were all in on it. - Get over here, novice. Be careful. You have years of rowing left. That's years of a lot of these girls. You'll make the 1V a year, maybe two. - This isn't fair. - No, it's not. But life isn't fair. That's so easy for you to say. Is it? Where's my seat race? I was in the boat that won the scrimmage. I charted the best course. You don't see me throwing a fit. You have to decide if this is the hill you want to die on. Trust me. It's not. Hey, I know you're late but your name's on the list. - Okay, I... - See you at the Parkhurst. All right, all right. Be there in an hour. So sorry. Please accept my apology. But love is blind, and I was too blind to see. Shit. You good dude? Dall, that's my ERG. Dall! You're kidding me, right? You couldn't let Highsmith row next to me? - We're gonna be a pair. - I know. Congrats, man. Great. What the fuck is wrong with you? Why'd you do it? Do what? Wait, you're pissed about the seat race? Yeah, you could have beat me fair and square. So... Yeah, I'm sorry you lost, but at least you could be cool about it. Yeah, you should have beat me fair and square. I don't even know what the fuck you're talking about. Can you fucking stop? You know, the difference between you and me is that I actually put in the extra work. You have all this talk about silver spoon bitches, and look who's Audi you're riding in right now. You know what? Fuck you! - I do what I have to. - Oh, my God. Something you wouldn't actually understand. This whole time, I thought you needed this. I really did. But you're just another silver spoon bitch. This is you. Yeah? Alex Dall. Presidential scholar. I actually thought they were fucking with me. Trying to put a wedge between us, but... there it is. Oh, and I checked. Presidential scholars, they get a full ride. I never said I needed a scholarship. Sure as shit let me think it. You know, this whole team thinks you're fucking insane. I was your friend. I had your back from day one. And you were supposed to have mine. You were my friend until I actually became a threat. - The second I'm your competition... - Fuck you! You turned on me! You don't fucking need this. You don't need it. So what difference does it make if you're in the 1V or the 2V? We can't be psychotic like you. Some of us have lives. Yeah, your mistake is that you always stick to what you're good at. You could have fucking earned it. You know, the funny thing... about teams... which you actually wouldn't understand seeing as you've never been on a team... is that you don't have to like each other. But you do have to respect each other. And no one respects you, Dall. I won that seat race. You've got to start taking care of yourself. You'll ruin the scholarship you do have. For what? My grades are good. - Are they? - Mm-hm. I spoke to your new TA. You... What's your problem? My problem? I don't know. What's yours? You're majoring in your worst subject, Alex. - Mm-hm. - Okay, you like a challenge. Taking tests four times Overkill, right? But for you, it works. I get it. Now you're trying to apply the same obsessive logic to rowing. It just doesn't work. You've got to let it go. Look. I'm not wrong here. Beating yourself to a pulp trying to get your team to say, "Good job, you earned this." Just like in high school, all for high fives and a podium. - No. - You gotta relax. Oh, my God. You know, I am so sick and tired of everyone in my life telling me to relax. Okay? Relaxing should be a privilege, not a fucking standard. If everyone sat on their asses and did nothing all this, this would cease to exist. If you didn't practice with your fucking band... I mean, maybe if you practiced more, you would be more than just an opener. You think you know things about me? I haven't told you shit about me. You don't know anything about me. I didn't go to graduation and have high fives and a fucking podium, okay? I didn't even go to graduation. Because I was 51/50'd by all the people in my life, yourself included, who kept telling me to fucking relax! I'm not gonna relax! You don't know how hard it is for me to be the best. How hard I have to push myself to be the best. Second best. Wow. Just... Okay. - You think I don't see you? - Just stop. Just... Dani, stop. Stop. No. Don't. Just stop it! You're self-immolating on a loop. Just quit. Don't. It's just... You don't under... I don't think you're ever gonna feel good. You don't understand. You don't understand! You'll never understand. I can't keep watching you do this to yourself. Don't watch anymore. Don't. We always knew this had an end date, right? All right. Next week, we will have our spring around-the-lake row. Okay, we'll knock it out in four days, There will be a sign up sheet, first come, first served. Now, this will help determine championship line-ups, but more importantly, let's have fun. Bullshit. Why do seniors have to do this? - It's our last week. - Shut up, Janssen. You know I'm coming for your record, Highsmith. Yeah, we'll see. So there's a record? Look, it's meant to be fun. Okay? - What is it? - So... What's the record? I, uh... I... I don't know it off the top of my head. Do you know it? Do you know what it is? It's your record, Highsmith. Do you not know your own record? Does anyone know Highsmith's record? You know, it's not actually even important... Fourteen minutes flat. Right. Thank you, Erin. Yeah, that sounds about right. Excuse me. Thanks. - There's a line. - Oh! Okay, sure. What the fuck, dude? It's supposed to be fun. I'm not rowing against you, psycho. It's your last week, and you already beat me in the seat race so what do you guys have to worry about? Fucking stupid. Piece of shit. Janssen, Mitchell, and Dall. It's gonna rain. Say it with me, ladies. We row in the rain. Not in the lightning. Any signs of it, head in. Otherwise, I will see you at the finish line. Ready? Row! This is bullshit! I'm motherfucking freezing! Fuck! Watch your point! What the fuck! - There's lightning. - There's no lightning. - Fucking lightning! - Shut the fuck up! - Fuck you! - You're gonna hit my oar! Fuck off! Fuck! You rocked my boat! Fuck you! Lightning! Lightning! There's lightning! Look! Yield! You fuckin' yield! Yield! You're gonna fucking hit me. Fuck! Ahh! Fuck! Fuck. It's lightning! Keep rowing through! Lightning, we have to go in! Keep rowing! Alex, we're going in! Keep rowing! - Alex! - Keep rowing! Keep rowing! Keep rowing! Keep rowing.
