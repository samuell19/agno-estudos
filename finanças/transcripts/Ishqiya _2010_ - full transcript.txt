"I linger no more." "I linger no more." "Those tears hold sway no more." "I linger no more." Emperor. Oh, emperor. Since you've built this mausoleum... ...your slave is ready to die for you. The army is off on a holiday, my queen. An entire army to kill an unarmed queen? I want to die at the hands of my emperor. Really? Not a chance. Why? Because... ...I have promised my new queen. -Who? -Don't trouble me. My new queen in the city. And this... ...mausoleum is hers too. Come. Take it. Jealous, are we? Go for it. Come. Here. Stop. Please surrender. What? Surrender. They have no witnesses to charge you under sections 302 and 304. And section 396 will get you only four years in prison. You went to the cops? Krishna. -You hear me? Did you? -Yes I did. Three days in three years. That's all the time I've spent with you. Lonely nights kill me each day. I lie on the bed like a dead body. I can't take it anymore. Now I get it. I'm such a fool. What do you mean? It seems like... ...my Krishna has found another lover. Look, I'll do as you say. If we don't come to power in the next three months.. ...I'll cylinder for sure. Not cylinder, you idiot. Surrender. Yes. Smile. You worry needlessly. So, can I go now? Rolling 1, 2, 3, 4.. "What a strange tale this is." "Where does it begin, how does it end?" "What are these destinations?" "Neither of us can comprehend." -Why, brother? -What, brother? -This gentle breeze. - And the hued skies. My heart soars. And my life too. So let's fly. -Where to? -To the heavens above. Do I look like a dog? A eunuch then? Or maybe you are? Brother-in-law, please forgive us. Desperate measures in desperate times. All your money is still here, Brother Mushtaq. Rs.2 million. All of it. Count it if you like. You think I have the guts to doubt your honesty? I lost ice worth Rs.15000 in my cold storage. 15000. If you wanted to steal the money... ...why did you blow the light fuse? We would be caught in the bright light. Anyway, the cold storage is to freeze your money. -Not the ice. -It's three-feet-deep, boss. Dig another two. The deeper the better... ...for this rotten uncle and nephew. They'll start stinking in no time. Show some mercy. Forgive! I'm like a brother to your wife. So, I am like family. Your brother-in-law. Please spare us in the name of God. Brother-in-law. -Hello, my love. -What's this commotion there? -Where are you? -It's nothing. It's just some family feud on the street. When are you coming home? -I'll come after the mausoleum? -Pray for me as well. Allah be praised. Any last wishes? Want you to hear a joke. A priest was fed up with his female parrot. She was ruining the piety of his household. Even I would be ashamed with the abuses this parrot blurted out. He consulted a judge. He advised him to bring the parrot over to his place. He owned two parrots. What better cure than good company? These parrots sang praises of Allah all day long. Overjoyed with this offer, the priest agreed. The priest brought his parrot over to the judge's house. Female parrot was caged there. The two male parrots smiled after looking at her. One smiled and turned to the other and whispered.. What did he say? I'm feeling shy! What? Khalu, you tell him. -No. You do it. -What did he say? Whisper it to him. -Can I say it in your ear? -Come. Sorry, brother-in-law. Let's go. Khalu. I think we should kill him. No. How can I shatter my sister's home? I consider him my brother-in-law. ...even if he doesn't. I hope the ropes are not too tight. I forgive you. Now set me free. Brother Mushtaq, maybe we erred a little too early... ...and you apologised a bit too late. Sorry! Next time, you'll dig your own grave. Get a priest along for a proper burial. Scoundrels! Scums! Rogues! "Ibn Battuta" "Carrying his shoes" "Ibn Battuta" "Carrying his shoes" "Slips 'em on, and it goes.. Churrrr.." "Flies in, picks on scattered grain" "Flies in, picks on scattered grain" "And the bird takes flight again" "Furrrr.." "Ibn Battuta" "Furrrr.." "Death waits around the corner" Greetings, saint! "Oh! What's the rush instead?" "Sound the horn, enter my garden" "Better late than dead" "Come.. let's fly away.. "Furrrr.." "Ibn Battuta" "Carrying his shoes" "Slips 'em on, and it goes..."Churrrr." Brother Feroz, greetings. Babban here. You've gone too far this time Babban. No. No. Don't even dream of coming to Bhopal. What are you saying? Where will I go? Mushtaq's men are tearing Bhopal down to find you guys. But brother...listen. I don't want to get killed. Sorry. Brother, listen. Hello? Scum, hung up. Iftekhar? Oh, Khalujaan? I am in jail right now. Same old case from 1984.. ...keeps re-opening every ten years. So you want to hang with me here? Hello? Khalu? What do you want.. "It plays from both the sides." I helped you last year.. ...and your nephew made my girl pregnant. What are you saying? And you have the guts to call me for help? Shameless. "It plays from both the sides." Is there any other number left, Khalu? Not in my list. All right then. Let's settle down in this car. You're talking to the king of Nepal. Asif Nepali. Just come here. Got it? Forget Mushtaq, even Musharraf can't bother you. It will be safe to cross the border via Gorakhpur. Gorakhpur. Verma. -Vidyadhar Verma? -Yes, him. Let's just barge into his house. He'll help us cross the border. "He's a speedbreaker." "Come...let's fly away. "Furrrr." "Ibn Battuta" Rs.263. -I don't have change, madam. -Okay. Sonu... Hello. Don't disturb.. "It comes flying for the food grains." "And the bird takes flight again Furrrr.." Those rogues stole it. Which one is Vidyadhar Verma's house? Do you smoke? No. -I've a cheroot. Want one? -No. I want a light. -But why? -Because I'm thirsty, you fool. How do I light this torch without a match? Fool. Krishna! Krishna! Have you burnt yourself dead? You have guests. Krishna! Who are you? Bandits? -No. -Then? -Thieves? -No. No. -Then? -Fools. A gift for Mr. Verma. His favourite rum from my town. 'Power horse rum!' According to myth, five pegs down.. ...and you'll snigger like a racehorse. We had become like brothers in just three months. He took shelter with us after killing that politician. Right, Babban? So is he in the unclothed or behind the veil? I mean, is he behind bars or on the run? I'll make some tea. But it's time for rum. He's just a funny guy. The bathroom's at the back. The towels are here. I'll fetch some ice for your drinks. Food is on the plates inside. No. We'll dine with Mr. Verma. When is he getting back though? Never. "The night burns ever so slowly" "The haze seeps into my eyes" "The night burns ever so slowly" "The haze seeps into my eyes" "Through the nights, bit by bit!" "I've unraveled each new dawn." "My eyes have, bit by bit.." "...seen the break of a new day." "Moist eyes hold..." "...the mist no more." "The night burns ever so slowly." "The haze seeps into my eyes." "My vision holds the fire of my dreams" "And with this fire..." "...I've illumined these eyes" Nandu! What is going on here? What happened? What did you break? Khalu? I hope you haven't ruined the jaggery again. Taste it for yourself, ma'am. Have you tasted it? I was fine with it the last time too. -Can you please taste it for me? -Of course, why not. Allah be praised. -Can I have some more? -Sure. What about you? I don't like sweets. Then how do you sing so sweet? Sorry, I ruined your plant in the morning. Doesn't matter. -Ma'am, please check the sugarcane. -Okay. I'm sorry to hear about Mr. Verma. We thought it has been sorted out. Then what happened suddenly ? But he was always there for his friends. The house is witness to his friendships. If you're friends with fire, you can't escape death. Cheers! You guys are as apart as chalk and cheese. Worse. As apart as a Hindu and a Muslim. Do I look so lowly to be friends with such a person ? He's my nephew. Who are you? Put that gun away. Not a gun, a pistol. It's trigger is twisted. If you fire, you'll blow your face. Give it to me! How old are you? 20 minus 5. How do you know so much about guns? In our village, we fire a gun before learning to wipe up. Something else is loose. Give it to me when I go to the forest. My father will fix it in a minute. Got it? Bye. Hey, listen, listen. Wait. What is it? -What is your name? -Nandu. Nandu. You want to ride with me to the city? After I'm finished cleaning. You know the way to the red light area? It will cost you. Obviously, I won't go to a brothel to beg. I'm talking about my money. But I'm not doing it to you. But I'm not doing it with you. Bye. "One look at you..." "and I feel this way..." "...that I've known you forever..." 'Tumhare Liye' (For you). I'm sorry? It's from the film 'Tumhare Liye'. Music composed by Jaidev. Beautifully sung by Lata Mangeshkar. -You seem to know a lot about music. -Yes. My uncle was a tabla player. Ustad Shakoor Hussain Khan from the Indore school of music. Then how come you... Destiny. Even so, I can play a little bit too. Keep humming, lest the food becomes too spicy. -Can you peel garlic? -Yes, of course. We need to cross the border into Nepal. Now, without Mr. Verma's help.. ...It will take two to four days to find a new workaround. Is there a safe house where we can lie low until then? You can stay here if you like. But... And the safe house will have no music to hear... -...nor any plants to ruin. -Yes. The garlic, please. Look...that's my village across the forest. And across that lake, the landlords'. Our army earned six landlords last month. Earned? I'm a fool! A caste war has been on since decades. Each caste has its own army. Even I will join very soon. You owe me 92 Rupees after deducting the fare. Here is Rs.500. Tell me. What will you do in your army? Go down this road and take a right... ...and return here when you're done. Got it? I'll give you Rs.100 daily. Work for us. First do your work. "There's kohl of night in Dhanno's eyes." "The moon kisses her." "There's kohl of night in Dhanno's eyes." "The moon kisses her." "This night looks poisonous without you." "The moon is on fire. You'll get a blister if you touch it." "This night looks poisonous without you." Hey! I will get hurt. Brother-in-law... Brother-in-law, forgive us. Do what? Forgive us. Just do what he's saying. Where's the money? -Inside... -Spent. It was here. Where did it go? What? I took 500 from it just this morning. Where did it go? To hell with this, Khalu. And you are? How about an introduction? Shall I go first? Brother-in-law Mushtaq. Leave her out of this. If you like, I could bury her with you. But with us dead your money is buried too, brother-in-law. Forever. One last chance. Please. -Hello, darling. -Sister. -Iftekhar, here. -Yes, brother. Tell me. -We are in big trouble. -What happened? One little goof-up and he wants to bury us alive. What do you want from me? It's brother's day next month. Please save us. -For God's sake. -Give the phone to him. -What? -Give the phone to him. Okay. Right away. -Yes, my love. -Look. He's your culprit, of course.. ...but he's also my brother. If you like, you can let them live. ...or just kill them. It's your decision. Goodbye. I... ...want my money back. Before brother's day next month. With interest. You can run if you want. But where will you go? Dubai? Qatar? Kuala Lumpur? Nepal? I'll get you anywhere. But not before I bury one half of her... ...in each of your graves. He wore shoes of steel. Crushed my bones, I guess. Keep your hand straight. It's just a small bruise. I'll just get you some turmeric milk. Where is the bag? Don't act innocent. Where have you hidden the money? -Babban, have you lost it? -You're the one who's lost it. Where could the bag disappear? It was here yesterday. No one came here except us. Someone did. Nandu. When? When you were busy enjoying yourself... ...he was busy cleaning your room. Where are you going? Where are you going, Babban? And they rape our daughters and sisters. But, we are not impotent anymore. These guns are not merely... ...to hang on our shoulders. But to barge in their houses... ...and shed their blood. If we have the courage! Which one is Nandu's house? Get him over here. Come on. Stand here. Who the hell are you? Tell the truth. I'm from Haliya village. That's very close to the landlords' village. Who told you the way here? What's your name? Razzaq Hussain. -Muslim? -Yes! Spill your real name and village. I'm originally from Bhopal. I'm staying as a guest in Haliya at Mr. Verma's house. Honestly. So, what's this, Mr. Guest? My pistol was damaged. Nandu told me to come to the village and he'd have it fixed. Listen, boy. Nandu has joined the army. -Get it? -Yes, sir. Don't even try looking for him. -Okay? -Yes, sir. So, how's Mr. Verma doing? He's no more. Don't you know? He... Khalu! Khalu! Khalu! Have you run away? Oh, Iftekhar! Old man, have you gone deaf? -Can't you hear me shouting? -What happened? What happened? My foot! Let's pack up and get out of here. This place is very dangerous. We only have Shias and Sunnis. But here, every other caste has its own army. And Mushtaq? We'll slip away so quietly that he'll grow old looking for us. And we'll grow old running. So, do you plan to lay a golden egg sitting here? Mushtaq has to be killed this time. Let him come. Wonderful, my heroic soldier. Mr. Iftekhar. Get up... ...and switch to top gear and let's get out of here. You go. I'm not coming. Why not? What's the matter? I can't have an innocent killed because of me. Innocent? Who? It's getting romantic here. Stop trying to be a hero. Why do you want to be a martyr when there's no country? You taught me. Save yourself first, remember? Let the girl die if she has to. -Why do we care? -You may not, but I do. I didn't give you shelter to put my life at stake. Nobody is running, fighting or doing anything else... ...without my consent. Always knew that you were a scoundrel. But you seemed smarter. As it turns out, you're the biggest fool. Innocent, isn't she? Why do you need firewood... ...when there are gas cylinders in the house? You shoot well! Where did you learn to shoot like that? Probably she won't talk to me. I thought you stole my money. Sorry about that. Let's stop fighting. Look... ...my tongue isn't quite poetic. So, what's a good tongue to make you understand? So, whose idea is this? Why care about the tree? Tell me how's the fruit? You may choke to death. You're angry, Khalu. You're no fool just because she called you one. And Khalu, this girl's nothing like what you think she is. Nothing like what? Like candy floss, rose petal. Fairy queen. Khalu, she's a firecracker. Thanks to Verma, she knows all the tricks of the trade. Trust me, Khalu. She has a brilliant plan. Yes. Much obliged, Krishna. Thank you so much. You let losers like us in your gang? But we're small fry. Laptop, mobile phone or at best, a car. We've not yet dared to abduct even anyone's pet. And she wants us to kidnap a millionaire. Why all the generosity? We're fools, aren't we? Are you listening? Fools. Sorry. He's had a bit too much. "This night, the weather by the river." "This lively breeze." "Said two hearts in one voice." "That once we meet, we will never part." You're upset with me... ...then why punish yourself? Go away! Just go away. Go where? Fine. You don't have to listen to me. But next time don't beg for mercy at Mushtaq's feet. It's not a pretty sight. With Mr. Verma death, my will to live was also reduced to ashes. A lone woman like me... ...is easy prey for lecherous men. Add to that, the emptiness of this house. I've often thought of killing myself. But somehow, it never bothered me... ...that all I actually have are two old saris. One bracelet and a few bindis. But since you've come... ...these things have begun to matter. Once again, I've found the desire to live. Why didn't you share the plan with me? "I linger no more." "I linger no more." "Those tears hold sway no more." "I linger no more." "In the pools of my eyes." "Dreams swirled in at night." "With a touch, they flowed." "With a whisper, they said." "Trust not such flights of fancy." "So...I linger no more." Target is the plan. The target will tell us what to do. Mr. Verma used his contacts in the Income Tax Department... ...and put together this list of targets. He was a true artist, Mr. Verma. -But who among these? -What's the ransom? -50 million -5 million. Why 50 million? 2.5 million for Mushtaq. Isn't the rest enough for us? You think small, Khalu. It's time for the big kill. Is 50 million enough? Not too little? 'There's no dearth of rich people in Gorakhpur.' 'Ram Prasad Gupta.' 'Din Dayal Trivedi.' 'Prakash Maroo.' 'Jaikishen Kedia.' 'Or Dr. Agarwal.' Mr. Verma would say, 'Throw a stone in the air..' '..and it will land on a millionaire's head.' 'But the bigger the catch, the greater the danger.' No. No. Krishna, greed will kill us all. Let's try something smaller. So that we get the money, without risking our lives. Okay, 50 cancel. Let's make it 20. Is there a smaller fish in the ocean? -What happened? -Nothing. I said let's fish for somebody smaller. What do you think? 'Kamal Kant Kakkar.' 'The small fish we are looking for.' 'He has a small iron factory. But his house is huge.' What do I do? I told him, we've got a 10 year visa, learn to eat pizza. 'Somehow, he's gone unnoticed by the kidnapping mafia.' 'But Mr. Verma was sharper than that.' 'And we will do what he had once planned.' Who do I do? Kukku! Kukku! Your ad is playing on TV. If you're bothered too, so why wait! 'Because there is none like KK steel.' 'Once we get him, Kakkar can arrange 20 million in two hours.' 'My steel.' 'Your steel.' 'Our steel.' 'K.K. STEEL.' Don't talk of these trade unions... 'Weapons.' 'Phone. Cash.' 'And the right time.' 'Where Kakkar was, is and will be.' 'We study every move he makes.' All I've earned till date. Will be enough to buy a used car. We won't need that. We'll be tracked down if we buy a car. We will steal one. I'll lift one tomorrow morning. "I'll lift one tomorrow morning." No way. If we steal tomorrow, we'll be arrested day after. We'll steal the car a day before the kidnapping. And we'll steal it from Faizabad, not Gorakhpur. Why? So that we mislead the cops... ...by placing hotel and petrol bills from Faizabad in the car. So they'll keep looking for us in Faizabad after finding the car. Some tea for you? Why, dear ? Yes, dear? Flying too high, are we? First draw a plan to take Kakkar. We have only 12 days left. 'Monday.' 'Tuesday.' He's here. Now tell me the car number. 538D... 'Wednesday.' 'Thursday.' Four days left. But brother's day is six days away. But your funeral is four days away. My niece gets married day after in Lucknow. -I'll look you up right after that. -But, Brother Mushtaq. Hello... 'Friday' The Chinese have taken over the market. How much? Only Rs.55000. Now the retailer... Fill up the tank. Go quickly. Go on. Liaqat, look after the rest of the work. Come back soon. We should've just run away... ...but your common sense was on a stroll. Doesn't look like we'll ever find Kakkar alone. And your brother-in-law is dying to give us a funeral. Kakkar goes to the temple at 8 o'clock and reaches the factory by 11. Considering it's just a half hour drive. What keeps him in the temple for so long? -Hello, Babban? -Move forward. Brother...brother, my phone fell down. One minute, Stop. My phone fell down. Kukku. Kukku. Who the hell is this? Where're you Mamta? Where're you Mamta? "Come my beloved." "I have reached the prime of youth." "I'm waiting for you come soon." Say something please "Come my beloved." "I have reached the prime of youth." You're my slave. Let's put your strength to test! So, can you quench my thirst? No, no. I can't be unfaithful to Mamta. -What about now? -No way. -Now? Now? Now? -No, no, no. Mamta, it's you! You win... I lose. Your love for me is eternal. Now will you quench my thirst? Sweetheart! My darling! -Sweetheart! -Sweetheart! -Kukku. -Kukku. This feels good. The world thinks he visits the temple... ...but the rituals take place in the beauty parlour. We couldn't have found a better place for our job. Babban, let's head to Faizabad tomorrow for the car. Was there anyone else there? Who? The lady with the whip. Lady, who? What happened? What's so funny? What happened? -I can't be unfaithful to Mamta. -Mamta, who? -Uncle, is this your phone? -Yes, it is. Thank you, my friend. It fell down inside. Thank you very much. Babban. It's been an hour. Are you laying eggs in there? Counting chickens. Khalujaan, breakfast. Please don't call me Khalujaan. Why not? It's such a nice name. Khalu means maternal uncle. I feel old every time you say it. My name is Iftekhar. That sounds even older. So then... ...let's cut out the Khalu... ...and stick with the Jaan (Beloved). What? Khalu, I can't go. Why? I've indigestion since last night. This was the 4th time already. You're an expert in stealing cars, anyway. It's too risky alone. Should I come along then? I'll be ready in two minutes. I'll give you a pill and you'll be fine. Feeling any better? You'll soon be better. If Krishna has said it, it will be true. Just a few more days... ...and we'll be back home. We can do whatever we want behind the banyan tree and riverside. It's so cool out here. Should we ask Krishna to come along? To the riverside? No, to the village. Better than being alone here. There she'll have me and you. And soon you'll be married too. We'll tell her, "Live with us." "Live with me." What happened? Are you alright? -It hurts too much. -Where are you off to? Can't control it. We'll miss the bus. Babban. Babban, we don't have time for this. Our bus is about to leave. Things are way beyond my control. Hang on to it. You can continue in Faizabad. Come out. Hey Uncle, hurry. It's time to go! Hang on, just a minute. Our bus is leaving you idiot. Come on. - I'm coming. Come and sit. "The sight of her binds me and I can't look away." "This silky strand I can't tear away" "It's been years since I've turned grey." "Yet the color of youth refuses to fade away." "Oh! And now my heart beats faster" "My face is losing its colour." "I fear those lonely nights." "My heart is but a child." "My heart is but a child." "Innocent but naive." "My heart is but a child." "The sight of her binds me and I can't look away." "This silky strand I can't tear away." "It's been years since I've turned grey." "Yet the color of youth refuses to fade away." "Who knew I'd given shelter.." "...to such a roguish heart." "Forever I imagined it would be..." "...as virtuous as me" "Oh! And it pulls at me." "It makes such a racket." "It gives undue importance to trivial things." "Nothing's more devious than the heart." "Someone stop me." "Someone hold me." "Or else at this age." "I will be deceived." "And now I fear I'll fall in love." "My heart is but a child." "My heart is but a child." "Innocent but naive." "My heart is but a child." How do I look? Like a fool. You like this better? "My heart is but a child" "My heart is but a child" "Innocent but naive." "My heart is but a child" Get dressed... Khalujaan will be here any minute. Screw that... I'm not going anywhere. You will have to. I'm staying right here. Here? Forever? And what will you do here? Marry you. Marry me? No, the lady with the torch. "I saw you girl and played my heart's guitar." "I saw you girl and played my heart's guitar." "Love-drops from your eyes.. ...and played my heart's guitar" "Drunkenness is all around" "Life is fun fun fun" "Hey hey here I go" "And my heart goes with me" "Hey hey here I go" "And my heart goes with me" Listen, I'm going to town. The shop will be closed. When will you be back? -In a couple of days. -Okay. I didn't realise when you got back last night. You should've woken me up. Couldn't sum up the courage to interrupt your dream. You're so silly sometimes, Khalu... ...Jaan. "Disco of pain." Cut it out. "Disco of pain." "That beautiful damsel." "Do it. Do it, India." "Do it. Do it, India." Nowhere to run. Nowhere to hide. Once more. Here on, my name is Doctor, yours Painter. And I'm Farmer. You've told us the plan ten times over since morning. Let's move now. Move. Ice-cream! Pogo Ice-cream! Pogo Ice-cream! Icy cold! Pogo Ice-cream. Icy cold! Pogo Ice-cream. From the film 'Anupama', right? Yes. Composed by S. D. Burman. Hemant Kumar. Wrong. It's SD. -Hemant Kumar. -SD. All right. Hemant Kumar. Now tell me why you've been sulking all morning? -What happened? -Nothing. You're such a bad liar. Because I'm a man. Really? And if you were a woman? Then you would never know if I was an angel or a whore. Kukku. I'm a goner. Yes. What gives you the right to abuse me? Are you my husband? My lover then? Or my pimp? Where are you coming from? License? Not bad. Thank you. What about the license? What precinct are you from? Kavva Bagh Colony. I see. Kavva Bagh Colony. Why do you want my name? Are you going to name me? Inspector Omveer is posted there too, right? Yes. -Convey my regards to him. -Sure. Khalu, what are you doing? Stop, you fool. There's an accident. There's an accident. Let's check it out. What did you do? Have you lost it? We were to kidnap, not kill him. Crowd will gather soon. Let's put him in our car. A car there... An accident took place there. What went wrong? Did the tyre burst? -Is he dead? -The brakes must have failed. Tyre is stuck in the drainage. What's going on here? Back off. Give the man some air. Mr. Gulati? I know him well. He does this quite often. Nothing to worry. Is there a hospital nearby? Let's get him out. Come on. Give me a hand. Come. Come out. Very good. You are civilized men of this country. "There's a strange attitude in your breaths." "It has made my heart fly like a kite." -Stop braying like a donkey. -No way. "There's a strange attitude in your breaths." What's wrong with you, Khalu? Truth is a bitter pill. Takes time to swallow. What truth? Sorry, Khalu. By the time I knew of your intentions. I had already slipped. I was wondering whether to tell you or not. In a way its good you know. Fate has sorted it out. Now just get us married. If not Krishna, you can at least play with her kids. What are you doing? Don't annoy me. Hey. Is it hurting a lot? So sorry. You deserve to be in the gutters. Your father had eloped with the priest's daughter. If I hadn't raised you... ...you'd still be a dog in the streets of Aligarh. And you? If not for me... ...you'd still be licking Mushtaq's feet. I've raised you like my own son, you rogue. Like your own son? You couldn't even get me married. You couldn't raise enough money to the wedding. The wedding party had to turn back. Nobody wanted a Casanova for a son-in-law. They figured both of you out quite early. -Who both? -You. -And? -And your mother. I warn you, Khalu. Don't drag my mother into this. I'm dragging nobody. The whole world says it. Says what? The whoring son of a flirtatious mother. I said don't drag my mother into this. Don't drag my mother into this. You don't listen to me. Where's Vidya? Who? My beloved husband. Vidyadhar Verma. Krishna? You immersed his ashes in the River Ganges yourself. I've told you before that he's dead. You're delusional that he's alive. Call him. Come on. Have you gone mad, Krishna? 'Dreaded criminal Verma dies in gas cylinder explosion at home.' Krishna! Krishna! You're free to go now. You can catch the evening train to Bhopal. Where's Kakkar? It's about 2.5 million. Perhaps, not enough for you. But enough to repay your debt. Please count it. We used to count it. Everyday before it was stolen. That's all we did day and night. I could've run away with the money. You would've never found me. -But I don't want the money. -You want more money. She's turned out to be the mother of all. Still want to marry her? And have your kids play in my lap? The sooner you leave this place the better. Better. Before we leave... ..may we know your reason for doing this? Love has no reasons. This bag is torn. Is there another one? Can I take that one? Where's Kakkar? Where is he? Where is he? Must be in the house somewhere. Let's go look. You go, Khalu. You're making a big mistake. Kakkar is a dangerous man. His steel business is a cover... ...to smuggle arms from Nepal. Really? -Kakkar is Verma's right hand man. -Is? You mean Verma is alive? Yes. And they tried to kill me. And they failed? Awesome. There's very little time left. Leave with the money or you'll get killed with me. Verma will be here soon. And why have you called him here? Last night, as you slept... ...I sat watching you all night. You're the first woman I've loved. And you whore... You were playing games with me? Babban! Don't know where she has hidden him. I can't find him. Babban! I knew her husband rather well. He was a big time crook. He would try to extort money from me too. But, sir... ..even he never asked for so much. I mean, I have money. But I can't just snap my fingers and get 40 million. 40 million? Didn't we fix on 20 million? But I've myself offered 25 million. Vidyadhar Verma was your business partner? Business? What business, sir? Arms smuggling from Nepal? Sir, I don't know what relationship you all share. I have nothing more to say in my defence. Sir, just tell me what you want me to do. How long to arrange 25 million? Hello. - Mamta? But I... Sister's hands were busy, so I... -Put it on speaker. -Okay. No, no, Mamta. Don't. Yes, Kukku? I need some cash urgently. Why? You've been kidnapped? No, no. Income Tax. Understand. Listen carefully. Take 15 million from the fridge. And 10 million from the microwave. Get to the factory quickly with the money. Men from the Income Tax Department will come in an hour. Kukku, you're.. - Don't worry about me. I'll be home by evening. -Let's go. -And Kakkar? Have locked him in the temple. They'll find him. Khalu... She knows everything about us. She might tell the cops. What do we do? What else? Kill her. -Khalu, you kill her. -Why? What do you mean why? Kill her. But why don't you kill her? Why don't you? Because I've fallen in love with her. This is great. When you do it, it's love. When I do it, it's sex. Nandu! At least count it. No, it's fine. You're just like family. It'll be fine. -Mr. Verma. -I'm no longer Verma. I'm Kulshreshtha. Shyam Prasad Kulshreshtha. I swear to God, Mr. Verma... I mean Mr. Kulshreshtha. If we had any idea, we would not get involved. If it wasn't for Mushtaq's sword hanging over us... ...we would've left long ago. -Right Babban? -Yes. All right. I'll go meet her myself. -So we'll take your leave? -Why? Don't want to see her one last time? Let's go. Come. Where are you taking us? Where? -Have we reached? -What's going on? Yes, yes. Please. -Where are you taking us? -Come out here. I've talked to Mr. Kulshreshtha. Where have you brought us? Not another word from you. -Babban, you're here, right? - I'm right here, Khalu I'm scared. It's time we start praying. How far is it? You want to kill us by making us walk? Sorry for raising my hand on you, Khalu. No. No. It's okay. I apologize too. -What are you doing? -Stop pushing. You wanted to know what I would do in the army. Check this out. Chinese pistol. Verma sent you to kill us? I was to dump your bodies in this river. It was my first solo job. You always knew that Verma is alive? No. I saw him when I went to the forest to meet my father. I thought I'd seen a ghost. Then later, people told me the whole story. What did they tell you? Emperor. Oh, emperor. When they got married... ...Verma had promised Krishna... ...that he'll leave his criminal ways. Forever. But he didn't. He loved her for sure... ...but not more than his weapons. Her stubbornness began getting in his way. 'He wanted to be free...' '...from the police and Krishna.' 'And for his rebirth, Verma orchestrated his own death.' Verma did a lot for our caste... ...but for what he did to Krishna... ...I can never forgive him. That's why I'm letting you go. No conflict is deeper than the one between husband and wife. It's by God's grace that she survived. Will He help her again? She's alone against Verma and his goons. You have her all tied up. She can't even escape. Darn it. What's it to us? Kukku. Kukku. Kukku! Kukku. Kukku. Where are you? Kukku. Kukku. Kukku. Kukku. And I slapped her twice. You are a woman, behave like one... ...else go sit on your father's head. We've to put them in their place. Hey you, stop. You dare attack cops? Hey you, stop. Come on, get the vehicle. Soon! I... ...was happy to hear that... ...that night you survived. How did you find out? Moustache? You look like a girl. How did you find out? You stubborn girl. You never understood. The army depended on me. Isn't it? I couldn't have run away like a coward for your sake. And you? Surrender. Surrender. Not surrender, but cylinder. That night the gas cylinder was empty. The cops insisted that I'm mistaken. But when I searched the corpse... ...your corpse. Then I was certain. Ask me how. You hated me so much? I hated you? So you think whatever I did that night... ...was because I hated you? I couldn't live with you or without you. -You could've taken me along. - As if you would've come happily? You could've abducted me. Abducted you? You're my wife. You should've come along on your own. Abducted you? Come on. Now come with me. We'll go, we'll go together. My emperor and his queen... ...will be buried in this mausoleum together. -No, Krishna. -No. -No, Krishna. Krishna! -Leave me. You! I'll peel off your skin. '13/24 come in.' 'Shots have been fired in the village.' 'The situation is out of control.' Mr. Kakkar, there are gas cylinders in the house. Let's get out or else we'll be dead. 'Get to Haliya quickly. Over.' 'Get here quickly.' - What are you doing? - 'There's a shootout.' 'Get here quickly. Over.' Krishna listen to me. You scoundrel! Krishna! Now you're scaring me. Open the door! Put it on speaker. Hello. Hello? Yes, my love. I've been trying to phone for past two days. Where are you? What are you up to? Thinking of you, what else? Shut up, liar. And your sinners? -Are they fine? -They've ditched me again. Oh, God. You are a kid at heart. You just like to play cops and robbers. This time, show no mercy whatsoever. First let me find them, my love? First let me find them. "Ibn Battuta." "Ibn Battuta." "Carrying his shoes." "Ibn Battuta" "Carrying his shoes."
