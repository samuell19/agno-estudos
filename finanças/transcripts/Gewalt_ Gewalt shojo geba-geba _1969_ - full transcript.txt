Sorry...it was a secret. lt's a lie! lt's a lie! lt's a lie! l'm sure it is a lie. What shall we do if it is true? Don't do it noisily like a horse, asshole. Did you hear a voice now?

Hanako! lt comes out! l left you in the lurch, so l should be punished. Amazing! Lots of.... me! Hey, what's going on now? l'm lost. So. l'm sure there is a lake somewhere, there is a fish in there, a water bug and a water spider. That boy has quite a backbone. He is brave to walk alone at this time of night. Exactly. Will you try? -What's wrong? -Don't you like shooting? What did you shoot? l got it! l felt the recoil! Hey, look after the customer. Boy, this is the president's garden. don't be a peeping Tom. l am looking for a pond. There isn't one. So, would you like a photo as a souvenir. Demon comes! Beast! Quickly, do something! -Don't come here. -Shut up...be quiet! Asshole! You are alive? You are still alive? Can you see? Can you see everything from up there? l just wanted to go for a walk. There was nothing. There is no lake. Everywhere is dried up. there are no fish, no birds,... no bugs, no beasts, no snakes... nothing lives here. l don't know why. Maybe everywhere is poisoned... the whole area. Can you see? Can you see everything from up there? Where l walked? Where l went for a pee? Where l went for a crap? Can you see, Hana-chan,... from up there? You saw it. You saw it all from the beginning? You're laughing, Hanako. Hanging around looking for a lake is stupid. You idiot. Yes, l understood... why didn't you tell me! Hanako. Here is the scar of a dead town. Hanako, you were right. Here is no sunshine, no sign of life. The darkness of a basement floor. Chilling to the bone. Getting so cold, like a big underground room. Enough talking in your sleep! You would not know that she has had a terrible experience. l don't know how many times to kill her. l pity her. We had a nightmare, and so felt like going mad! She cried and yelled all night. Kill me, kill me! She didn't mention you anymore. Just said, kill me. Her voice is scarcely audible at last. We listened to her all night! We didn't...see. At midnight... from faraway... bullets come at us. lt was only one bullet, but she got hit. lt intentionally missed her heart. Still alive! Still breathing! lt's such a cruel murder. lt must be one person to carry out such a cruel murder. Boss. Boss shot her. Yes. l felt the recoil...l felt the recoil. l shot her. l am the boss! Devil! Demon! Don't kill me! Help me! No, don't kill me! Help me! Please don't kill me! Next! Why are you looking at me that way? With that disgusted face? lt's better to die than have sex with a beast! lt came out...lt came out...see. At the front of Fujiko. -Where? Where! -Shut up! Calm down! Why don't you kill him! One girl finished, two more to go. He needs two more girls to have sex with him. -Untie me! -l'll kill him when the girls are finished. Why don't you kill him right away? Boss's order. Where is the boss. Where? Over there. -l don't want to! -ls he boss? -Are you sure? -He is the boss even if it's a lie! -Which is it? -Either or! Don't yell! He is the boss! -Hurry up! -Somebody rip off the tail! Hurry up! -Come on! -No! No! Hurry up! Rip off the tail! lt came out. lt came out. Help me! Don't die. Don't die Hanako. l'll show you good things soon. No! Please stop! Hurry! Next! Boss, it's not possible anymore. lt's not possible boss, it's bad for your health. Give me a break! Please!

At last you've gone to the lake. lt's like l see you. Hoshi's swimming. No l'm not, Hanako. l'm really... in the basement room. -You're lying. -l'm telling the truth. Blood is dripping. l can't see anything. l can't hear the wind. lt smells so bad. Can you hear... what l am saying? l can hear you, but... please speak louder. No, l can't... because l am dying. lt's okay. You are dying. l am watching over you. Hoshi, you are really here. Come here quickly. Help me. l want to come, but l can't. l'm not human anymore. Why? l'm... dead. lt's horrible. l am still alive. Hoshi, is dead before me. lt cannot be helped, forgive me! l want to see you soon. We can see each other soon. But...l am ashamed. -About the tail. -Yes. A very big tail came out. l have a big tail even if l am dead. Bite it! Even if l bite it, l cannot rip it off. Use a knife to chop it off. Even if l cut it, it will not come off. lt keeps growing back. Disgusting! l don't like you with a tail. Are you sure you don't like me. l think so. lt's natural. lt's a lie, Hoshi. lt doesn't matter. You are angry? Please say something. l'm not angry. Do you love me? Yes... l love you. Me too. Even with my tail? l love you... l feel awful. lt hurts! Quickly, please help me some way or another! ''Hoshi's... tail why did it come out? ''Falling star. ''Hoshi's... tail why didn't it disappear? ''Falling star''. Hanako! Are you dead? Oh, it smells like crap! Slackers! Shame on you! l feel disgusted that l raised such cowards. The boss's estate is not broken just because sometimes we have a big house cleaning exercise. Young men with steady nerves.... -All together! -Everybody's watching your back. Boss, let's take a picture. Wait! Dammit! Hana-chan! look at him! ''Hoshi's... tail why did it come out? ''Falling star. ''Hoshi's... tail why didn't it disappear? Falling star. Symbol of the dog. Symbol of the beasts. Why is Hoshi's tail scary? Falling star. The End.
