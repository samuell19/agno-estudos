It's much colder than last year. And it'll get worse. - I've brought more information. - I know, but we can't do anything. - Tell Mr. De Carmine. - But I don't know him. He's already here, you see? It belongs to the man we saw earlier. Wakey, wakey! You're so vulgar! Get to work, Carmine! I feel great today! - Good morning. - Good morning. Breathing is important when exercising. - Stationery! - Here! - It's arrived at last! - I want some pencils! Give me an eraser. - Good morning, sir. - Bye, darling. Bye, daddy. I'll be back for you at midday. Hello, general. Good morning, Mr. Mayor. - Good morning, Mr. Mayor. - Good morning. - Good morning, Mr. Mayor. - Let's take a look round the offices. The Mayor! For His Excellency's arrival, I thought of fireworks and music. Luminous fountains, fantastic fireworks! I've thought of everything. No petitioners for three weeks, we've got other things to so. It's the Mayor! I just want to say a few words. Just a few, which will be more than enough. Let's see what my staff can do. What day is it today? Sorry, Mr. Mayor. At your service. Good! - Very good. - Thank you. - You did all of these? - Yes, Mr. Mayor. But the "L" is difficult to make round, because... - It's tricky. - I know! Gothic characters are difficult. Good, very good. I want to congratulate you on your work. I wanted to say... of course! I'm not happy with how this office is being run. You have to work harder. Especially now, on the eve of an event, a unique event, which you will be informed of in due time. Good day to you all. Having fun, eh? Get to work! - Mr. Mayor, we got it! - Really? We found a new fragment of cipolin marble, there's no doubt! Good! Get a notary, a photographer. Record the minutes. - Call the registrar. - He's dead. - He's dead? - Dead. Stand in for him today, tell the others too. Good work, professor! You, De Carmine. Come with me and bring some writing material. - Pen, paper, ink and a table. - Yes, sir! Quickly. - Get your commas right. - Yes, thanks. - Mr. De Carmine... - Me? - Quick, hurry! - Yes, sir. - I have to go. - We'll wait here. Excuse me! Dear professor, your dream, I mean, our dream, is about to become true. Happy? - Write this down. - Yes, sir. It's a bit chilly today. Good, fresh, Northern wind! It refreshes your mind. I'll just illustrate to my colleagues your discovery. Here. We are standing exactly in the centre of the city, with its great buildings and temples. To the south there's the forum, what we call the Hall of Justice, in other words, important buildings destined for public use. You see? A city! And they say ancient civilizations didn't pass through here. - 2,000 years before Christ. - No, 2,000 years ago! It's the same. This was all reconstructed thanks to the discovery of the fragments you have seen. Gentlemen, let us take a minute to reflect... No, half a minute is enough. - Pass the fragment round. - Look. - It's truly magnificent. - Very interesting. Here you are. What the hell are you doing? - Just keep writing! - Yes, Mr. Mayor. It's such a valuable fragment! - Idiot! - Yes, sir. It must be ready for His Excellency's arrival. - But we only have seven workmen. - You'll have 70, 700! Isn't 700 too many? - We might find nothing. - Nothing? - In this sedimentary area... - The die is cast! We're at war, we must fight. We too shall have our noble licence that factitious historians wanted to contest. The remains of the ancient city will be kept in the obelisk. This large marble exedra will block the unsightly view of the suburbs and a large marble area will provide a worthy frame. We perfected this project behind closed doors. You can approve it today. We must get ready for His Excellency's arrival. - Is the band ready? - Yes. - Record the approval. - What? - It was approved! - That thing? Write it down! Now for the second part, gentlemen. We shall begin work as soon as His Excellency gives official credit for the enterprise. Gentlemen, we will be praised from those in high places, I promise. Sit down. Let's talk briefly about the financial problem. Before... You'll have your say, sir. We can't all talk at once. The rough estimate, which needs amending, is a total of about... - 175 million liras. - 175 million. - Get up. - But... a hundred million! - 175, that's what he said! - But that's a lot! - Let's hear the accountant. - The sum isn't unreasonable. Because in relation to our budget... We need to cut out all expenses which are unnecessary and increment the income with taxes. We've already sent the new taxes file, according to your plan. And then there are the fines too. Right! Colonel, we've prohibited many new things. - Do your soldiers sleep? - No, sir. So we're agreed then. You got that? - Yes, sir. - Over to you, sir. Before continuing with this interesting debate on art, I must inform you that there are no new developments in the health sector. I'm pleased to hear that. The public hospital is still waiting for the blankets to be returned. They were publicly donated to the poor during His Excellency's last visit. As an example of solidarity, but this topic isn't on today's agenda. - You got that? - Yes, sir. Don't, it's not on today's agenda! We also need to discuss the drainage problem in the housing estates. Let's keep to today's agenda. We'll see to the housing estates, you think of a solution for now. I can't think of everything! From the moment that the second part of our project has been brilliantly resolved... - Did you write that down? - No. Write it down! The financial estimate is approved. - And the 75... - 175, get it right. Good. Read out the minutes. Yes, sir. Four, three, two... no. One, three... - No, two comes after one. - Well, what's the problem? You know, you make notes but... "Dear professor... "Dear professor... your dream, I mean, our dream or your dream..." What dream? "Good, fresh, Northern wind! It refreshes your mind. Here is the cipolin for you to admire. Seven workmen? No way! You'll have 700 or 700,000 B.C. Yes. Are we agreed? We're at war and must fight. Especially as His Excellency is arriving. The die..." P.T.O. It's one of my notes. I missed a word. "The remains of the ancient city and the large exedra, along with the splendid view of the suburbs, will provide a worthy frame. Make a note that it was approved. The officer's approval will arrive from high places. It's around 175 million, so... and the fines will raise the income... so that... Colonel, what do your soldiers do, in general? They sleep, colonel." - Stop! - "The hospital needs blankets. The drains smell and the stones speak the language of centuries. The smell's not so bad in winter, it's not on today's agenda anyway. The suburbs are never on the agenda!" Stop, you're an idiot! You've got it all wrong! - Get out! - The interesting dream... Get out! Hurry, come on. Get out of here! Go to hell! Out! Gentlemen, this meeting has been very useful. Good day to you all. At your service, general. I don't want any interruptions, I'm very busy. - Today's a historical day. - Indeed. This project will take you to the Senate. You think so? - You think I give a damn? - That's what'll happen! We'll oblige you, you'll see. All in good time. You may go. Your Excellencies, citizens, the Senate I have the honour of belonging to... No! Stop! I won't let you speak! You threw away the cipolin fragment, you broke the chair, then you criticized the mayor's work by changing the minutes. You need to smarten yourself up. You go around like a tramp, with a hole in your coat, offending the honour of the Council and don't forget... It may not seem that way, but I know everything. - I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor. - Flattery won't work. You're no good. I can't save you from being fired. Try apologizing to the mayor. I'll call him. Make a good copy of those minutes and add the information from the land register. - It's in the archive. - Yes, Mr. Mayor. Right away. Well, commendatore? My dear friends! - It's all set. - Great! The building contracts will be signed next week. - Great! - We've launched our ship! - And what a great ship! - We're all aboard! Darling! I woke you up. Tell them I'm in a meeting. You're still in bed? At this time! What have you got on? My darling, you know I always sleep like this! I dreamt a lot! I can't tell you what about. Yes, I dreamt of you too, Cicci! No, I don't believe you. Tell me... What are you doing, all alone? Tell me. I'm thinking! I'm here with Chicca, she's very restless! She got married yesterday, poor thing. What a dear! - What about the ink? - No one comes here. - Are you going to the archives? - Yes. - They're closed. - Good. I've come, Mr. Mayor, to apologize for the terrible mistake... the terrible mistake I made. Yes, darling, I know. Go on. Go on, I said! You know I'm very busy. His Excellency's due and my head's exploding. Darling, please! No, I'm having lunch with my wife. No, darling. Calm down! You again! Are you spying on me? Go away! Thank you. - Bye, De Carmine. - Go ahead. - No, you go ahead! - No, no. Go ahead and have it, it's for you. - You've got a hole here. - Yes, I know. Goodbye. Don't take any notice, it's a tiny hole. Its tiny, but it's still a hole. I wrote it all down, from the battle onwards. You have to help him, he's waited 40 years for his pension. Young men like you should know what really happened. So... That's how things went after the battle. This bit here is when I said, "Third platoon, bayonet!" You know how many men were left with me? - I don't know... - Just take a guess. - Twenty-four. - No, three, my dear man! - You poor thing! - Read it then let me know. Can I come by tomorrow? You can come here whenever you like. - All right, friends? - We'll be back tomorrow, thanks. Read it! Don't think you can hide! There are more taxes to pay! - What for? - Don't be such a hypocrite. Look at your great Council! Read it. "Supplementary drainage taxes." Go on! "Complementary taxes for the city's beauty spots." What are these beauty spots? - Bloodsuckers! - We'll have your eyes out. May I? Come in. Who's is it? I'm an old client of yours. Five years ago, remember? You repaired my coat. - Just tell me what you need. - Well, you see... This coat is still in good condition. There's a tear, but it's a small job. And then it needs some invisible mending. It was an accident. You know, women... There was a woman and... - There's nothing to mend here. - I know, it's in good condition. I'm just being fussy. - It just needs a patch. - Says who? Who's the tailor? You or me? - You. - So? A patch! I wouldn't know where to put. There's nothing left to cut here. You call this a coat? It's a jacket, and it's too short. Good morning, sir. You could use a patch of a different colour. I'm an artist, you put a patch on it. It's impossible, you need a new coat. - New? - New. Brand new? Who'll give me it? - Give you what? - The money. Just keep these rags and stop wasting my time! To think I came from the capital to live among rags and shabby fabric. Any spare change? Your whims and fancies ruined me If I cheated at the game It was for you I go down the steep hill My hand forces me To strive desperately for you Woman! Oh, woman! You were born to make me suffer. Woman! Oh, woman! You will be the death of me This music programme is courtesy of the Lanetti store. "Lanetti coats, perfect coats," I'll have a coat made, I'll have one made! I'll have one made! Make me one, make me one... I'll have one made. Teresa! - What is it? - Quick, bring me some grappa. What's happened? Come on, tell me. You can trust us. - I'll have one made. - One what? A coat... a new one. - Here's some grappa. - He's crazy. Make me a new coat. - Here, sit up. - It's grappa, you'll feel better. I don't like it. I raced here! I've made up my mind, that's it. Great! Turn the light on. Let's get to work, my friend. What a great physique! Get me my measurement book. I'll show you the model - This one? - No. This one? No. This one. No. - This one! - Good, you're a man of class. - Ready? - Yes. Right... shoulders: 16. You don't need a fur trim. Lift your arms up. Chest. Chest: 38. You're well-built! If you groom an old cat... it looks as good as new! Sleeve. Sleeve: 24. Crotch... we don't need that! Height. Height... Height: four foot two. - Four four two? - That's the coat's length. Then they are your legs, head... You're average height. - What about the price? - Hold on, let's see... 35 minus 10... Plus 20, plus 19, minus 37... 50,000 liras. Fifty... - That includes the fur. - Give me some grappa! That's too much. You can pay half now and the rest in instalments. I don't want any bills, my savings aren't enough. You'll find the money, just skip lunch like I do. I'm in great shape. With a new coat, you'll be a new man. Your career will take off and women... Women love a good coat. - Really? - They do, believe me! - Put it on my bill. - Put what on it? - My word. - Your word? - Get out of here! - Won't you mend it at least? - I'll pay you right away. - Go hang yourself! All right, I'll mend it myself. First he wants a coat, then he doesn't. Carmine, they want you. - Someone rang the bell. - The dwarf wants you. - Mr. De Carmine! - I have to see the secretary. Listen to me... he always runs away! At last! We're almost there. - Yes, but we mustn't give up. - Of course. - I know you wanted to fool me! - What? Even the kids know about your dodgy contracts for the excavations! - Excuse me. - We're talking. False papers, fake auctions... I wasn't born yesterday! Wait! - We can't discuss this here. - Yes, we can! I want to talk and I want everyone to hear me! - I'm going to the Mayor. - You want to cause a scandal? I'll give you a scandal! They called me... - Why didn't you say? - You wouldn't let me talk! That's all right then! - We're all gentlemen! - That's all right then. I was really furious. Come in. All right, don't worry. Yes, yes. All right. At your service. You must come right away when I call you. Yes, sir. You're my worst member of staff. You don't care, do you? All right, we'll take action then. As from today, you're fired. - But I... - You're fired, now go! - This is a place of work. - Damn! Don't use vulgar words in my presence. No, I said "damn"... I thought... Keep your thoughts to yourself. And next time I call, come quickly. - Yes, sir. - What was that racket? - They wouldn't let me through. - Who? The men who came to see you. Another one came along and said, "I'm going to tell the Mayor". "I'll cause a scandal." But he wasn't going anywhere and he wouldn't let me past. Go on. - Go on. - That's it. - What were they talking about? - Nothing, it was all a game. Even the children knew. The auction game, false papers... You know, papers... Then they made an agreement and shook hands. - You saw them, you're sure? - Yes, they wouldn't let me past. Then they went off hugging each other happily. You know this is confidential information? - Yes. - Don't say a word. - No, sir. - What? I mean, yes, sir. Listen... I want to give you one last chance. I'll talk to the Mayor and try to persuade him. I'll also try to get you your bonus. You don't deserve it, but I'm feeling generous. How much is the bonus? Ten thousand, but don't say a word. - May I ask you something? - Go on. - When? - At the end of the year. You can have it now, if you need it. - What did you say? - You can have it now! - I'll give you a money order. - At your service, Your Excellency. A money order for 10,000 for the fabric for my coat. It was here, I'm sure! Help! Thief! I've been robbed! - What? - My money's gone! - I'm ruined! - What money? My money, I'm ruined! No, I'm not. Had I put them there, I would be. But I'm not stupid. Where would thieves look? No! I found a good hiding place... A great place! No, no. Because... - It's here. - This is my room. Right! You wouldn't look here. - What are you insinuating? - No offence meant. - Help me. - What are you doing? - Where are you taking it? - Just bear with me. Let me show you. My floor! You're breaking it! Of course! How stupid of me! Here it is. I knew it! Yes? We'd like some nice fabric, for a winter coat. We have some nice combed wool, but it's expensive. - Let's see it. - Yes. It's 100% wool. - How about 90% or 85%? - Yes. - That one looks warmer. - It's heavier. I'm terribly sorry about these feathers. I'll get rid of them. Sorry. - Look. - Nice. - Have you decided? - One moment. I need to look... - This one. - This one. That's great! Look in the mirror. It's a masterpiece. Everyone who sees it asks me who it's for. I said it's for a big shot, a friend of mine. Shall we try it? No, I want to do it. Commendatore, look in the mirror. It's wonderful! Good morning, sir. You look like a new man! It's perfect. It's a masterpiece! Shall I send it to you? I have to pass by the Council. Good morning. Did you see that coat? Nice, isn't it? I made it! It's fabulous! - Sir, would you like a table? - No, I'll have it... there. - Yes, sir? - Good morning. Water and...? A coffee. An espresso for the gentleman. Here's your espresso. - Excuse me, that's mine. - It doesn't matter. Look! Holy Mary! You're Mr. Carmine. - Hello. - I didn't recognize you. - Here's your coffee, sorry. - You drink it. Your espresso. Have you read it? I haven't had time, I've been very busy. I've got more proof, here. It's all true. - You know what this letter says? - It says: - "I, Mohamed Vassari, the Turk..." - You know what they say about Turks! "I declare before Allah..." That's... "That Officer Luigi Baldini was dying when I found him." Dying, you heard that? It's all true. When I woke up, I thought I was in heaven. You know what he did? He ran away to meet the others. You know what they did when he got there? They put him on trial. Excuse me, but I have to go. Don't forget what we told you! Time's running out for him. He's waited 40 years for his pension. Tell them I didn't run away. I was dying. - How are you now? - Better. But I won't die unless they give me my pension. Don't worry, leave it with me. Now I've got this, everything will be simpler. - I have to go. - Thanks. Hurry, they're all up there. - It's great! Let's have a look. - Andrea made it for me. We'll have to christen it. - What on earth is this racket? - Good morning. Well, well! Did you inherit some money? My compliments. Sir... I've been saving up for the past 15 years. - I treated myself. - What was that racket about? They wanted to christen it, it's new. Before you go to wish the Mayor a happy new year, I'm informing you that you're invited to my house tonight. Thanks! The Mayor will also be joining us. You will appreciate this gesture. That way, we'll christen Mr. De Carmine's new coat. We are a family not just colleagues. Let's go. - Will it be quick? - Yes. - What if I'm late for the party? - It'll only take a minute. - What do you want? - The gentleman wants his photo taken. - Where is he? - Here. Comb your hair and take off your coat. - That's no good. - We want a photo with his coat. Over there. - He's an artist. - What him? Yes. Is he good at photographing new coats? - Keep still. - This one won't do. It's an elegant coat and it needs an elegant pose. - Show me an elegant pose. - I will! I've got an idea. No, don't do that! You'll ruin the pockets. I know, allow me. Not like that, hold it between your index an middle finger. Like that. One moment. There. I've looked for that all day! Hold it, but let's be quick. - Come and look. - Right away. Go under. - Can you see? - Not very well. - Now? - He's disappeared. - Great! - All right. - Now leave, you can't stay here. - But I came especially. I don't want anyone around and magnesium's dangerous. Good luck, Carmine. - But... - Keep still. Keep still, smile and don't be scared of the bang. Keep still, smile... I'll count to three. One, two... - What time is it? - It's ten thirty. When it rains, it's easy to make friends with people. - Can I help you? - No, goodbye. Well? - What have you got? - Soap, razor blades, wallets. - The ones... - Yes. - What else? - I've got razors, pipes, gold plated pendants, cigarette holders. - The ones... - Yes, those ones. - What else? - Dolls, plastic buckets... - Toy trumpets! - The ones... - Yes, those ones. - What else? Brushes, tape measures, coils... perfume... - Combs. - Only these ones? No, I've got ones made of bone, turtle shell, metal. They're sturdy. Will you buy it? It's so easy to say: "Buy it!" These decisions, even though they determine the purchase of the item itself, can't be taken standing still, let's keep walking. - Which way are you going? - Straight on. I'm not, here. - What about the comb? - Keep it aside for me. - What? - The comb. What a cheek! - Sorry. - Damn this umbrella! Won't it open? Let me try. You see? It worked for me. - I have to go that way. - I know, but we're testing it out. If it closes again, I'll open it for you. - You got that? - Really! - Here. - I have to walk back now. I know, but your umbrella's open now. - You'll speak to the mayor tonight? - Oh... it's you. - Yes, I'll try to have a word. - Thanks, sir! - But I can't promise anything. - Where there's a will, there's a way. - Off you go. - I'm unemployed. I have 5 kids. - I know. - Please! - I'll see what I can do. - Thank you! This might be our lucky night. Thank goodness! - It's marvellous! - My compliments. Congratulations! Let's shake hands. Would you like a drink, sir? It'll be perfect. When His Excellency arrives, the music will start... On the other side there will be the fireworks. The whole city will be celebrating on the bastions. I'll say: "Your Excellency, this is our history at your feet". - Wonderful. - A great idea! Great. So everything must be ready. Congratulations. A drink, sir? A drink, sir? Gentlemen, it's midnight! Happy New Year! In our big family, we have a motto: Close ranks and go forward. - Mr. Mayor! - Be quiet! Mr. De Carmine will make a toast. Yes. Mr. Mayor, close and distant citizens... I came to this party to christen my coat. It's a nice coat. The secretary, who works and sings all day, said to me: "Won't you come to my house? Everyone's invited." - What are you saying? - Let me finish. Now I remember what I wanted to say. - The officer didn't run away. - The officer? The Turk said so. You know what they say about Turks... You know how many stamps are on the request? - No. - Take a guess. - I don't know. - Go on! He doesn't want to say. 295! - Have you finished? - No! There are plenty of problems. Outside, it's snowing, it's cold and they get wet. Pensioners and young unemployed children. This is their request, read it! If no one reads the requests... Sorry, Mr. Mayor... If they don't read them... You're an embarrassment. You're drunk. Get out! May I? You don't mind, do you? You're great! All right, forgive him. He's drunk, but it's New Year's Eve. - Good night and Happy New Year. - Goodnight, thanks. - Goodnight, miss! - Great coat. Happy New Year and sweet dreams! I'll give you ring sometime. Happy New Year! Mr. De Carmine! - Did you speak to him? - Tomorrow. - What? - Tomorrow. Happy New Year. Happy New Year! - You want a light? - I want your coat. No, not my coat... My coat! Stop, thief! Help! Police! Police! Help! Stop, thief! - My coat was stolen! - Really? It was new, with a fur trim. It cost me 50,000 liras. - Where was it stolen? - Right there. If you go after him, you'll get him. My shift's over, I've been pedalling for seven hours. - And I've got arthritis. - But... - Go to the police station. - You have to catch him! - It's not that easy, my dear man! - Aren't you going to do anything? You call yourself a policeman? Maybe you don't know, but I'm a night warden. Go to the station, it's down there on the right. - What about my coat? - Go to the station. My coat! Help! My coat! My coat! Where are you going? - I want to talk to the Mayor. - Who? - The Mayor. - He's busy. Can I write him a note? MY COAT'S BEEN STOLEN DE CARMINE CARMINE What does that mean? Write a proper reason. "For reasons that are personal and confidential." The celebrations will be great! Fireworks, arcs of triumph. You'll see. By the way, what about that chap? That oafish lieutenant... what's his name? Franceschini! - Fabio. - I don't remember him. It's been so long! - How long has it been? - Years. - It's time I went. - No, wait. Wait. Not now, can't you see I'm busy? - Who is it? - An employee. - Make him wait. - Yes, sir. What did he say? Must I wait long? ORDER AND PARAGONS ARE THE BEST FORM OF AUTHORITY Yes. Right. Come in. I... Mr. Mayor and Mr... Sorry, I sent that note... I need to speak to you for a minute. What do you want? Remember me? I was at the party, I made the toast. The toast? Well, my coat's been stolen, my new coat. Yes, the one with the fur trim. If you could write a letter to the police... If The Mayor writes it, well... Be quiet! Firstly, you came in without asking. Secondly, you've ignored the hierarchical order. Thirdly, you insulted an important organ of the State. Who do think you are? What do you take me for? This sort of request is dealt with by the relevant offices, who, following the usual procedures... the usual procedures... send it to my secretary and only he is allowed to give them to me. But Your Excellency, I... Your Excellency, I took it upon myself to come because secretaries are not trustworthy people. What? My secretaries are untrustworthy? Sorry, I shouldn't have come. I didn't follow the procedures... your secretaries are honest, but I can't live without my coat. You have to help me, I want my coat! I want my coat back! - Your Excellency! - Enough! You came into my office like a thief, while as you can see, I'm busy. All right, come in! Don't sit down! The Mayor is at your service. But what for? For a letter of recommendation! Don't the police arrest thieves? I'm the first citizen who would never dare conceive such an awful request. Go now, I don't even want to remember your name, just as long as you say you were treated with kindness here. Do you understand? Get back to work. Go! Thank you, Your Excellency. It's character building. As from today, that man will open his eyes to reality. He'll become a lion, I want to see what happens. Let's see what happens. Thieves! You're all thieves. Thieves! No! You heard that? He's coming... he's coming! Here he is! Stop! No! Let go of me! My coat! My coat! Mrs. Flavia! Call the police, the army, the carabinieri! - He's gone crazy! - Call the doctor. TO MISS CATERINA Good morning, Caterina. You see, Caterina? I'll get it back. Don't cry, I'll get it back. And we'll be able to go walking together. You with your little dog with its coat and I'll have my coat too. I'll put a trap inside it, in the lining, so when the thief tries to take it, he'll get trapped. My coat! My coat! Stop, thief! My coat! - My coat! - Mr. Carmine! Arrest him! My coat! Arrest him! - You see, doctor? - I want to go out! - Poor man! - Be quiet! - Don't you feel well? - No. - You've got a fever. - He's a bit crazy. Let me try this side. What happened? I'll be right there, Your Excellency. - Do you understand me? - Don't talk, keep quiet. I'm not sure, you listen. - Is that all right? - No. He's dead! It's a last minute celebration, a modest welcome. Your Excellency, look how beautiful that building is. It was made by our... Correct me if I'm wrong. Down there on the right, there's the Sant'Anastasio church, a gem of Romanesque architecture. You've got a great memory! But we've arranged a tour! I remember it well! In the dome on the left, there's a famous painting, "Piet?", by a very famous painter. - Well... - Let me finish. It's on the tip of my tongue. Don't move, wait for orders. I'm going to have a drink. A drink for the driver! Same again. This fortunate and ceremonious day underlines a decision that will bring our city new and unexpected prosperity. But there are other reasons for our happiness. Material values are worth much less than the immortal values of art and of the people! Ever since the day when Professor Filippi published his eminent passage, everyone in the world has looked to our dear city. And its aims, that I... as speaker for this city, express to you in this moment, as its humble speaker. We want to revive, we want beauty, we want to give back... Who could class such an enterprise as unproductive, when it has the support of all citizens? Nobody! And so, citizens, I say to you; "Close ranks..." Who dares ruin this celebration? An employee from the Town Hall. They stole his coat when it was freezing. His name was De Carmine. The entire project entails a great financial contribution, but the allocation of the budget has been approved. It won't be the money that holds us back... - Sir. - What? - I want my coat. Thieves! - Who said that? - I don't know, what did you hear? - A strange voice. Give me my coat. Where's the Mayor? What Mayor? - I want my coat. - Who was that? - Was it you? - No! - Give me my coat. - Help! Help! - My buttons! Was it you? - Me? - You pulled my coat! - It was you! No, it wasn't me! - Who was it? - It's not true! - Us? - It was you! - It was you! - It was him! Gentlemen, thanks for your cooperation. Thank you, even if you wanted to speak of trivial topics at the end of this day. Ghosts, spectres! As if everything in the world wasn't clear, real and visible. If someone's playing around, the police will find them, because I'll get to the bottom of this! - There was some truth... - Nonsense. - May I? - Go on. Someone ripped my buttons off. - Mr. Mayor... - One more word and you're fired! I'll get the police to deal with it. That's it as far as I'm concerned. - May I? - No! You're all free to go. - You! - Me? Yes. You could have avoided all this trouble today. - How? - You let the hearse go through, you sabotaged my speech with those speakers and you assisted the others in creating panic. I worked very hard to prepare this ceremony. I worked for a whole month, you're so conceited! - You never let anyone speak! - Be quiet! I'll see to everything from today. Bring me the building contracts. - You think you can profit from them? - Yes. - Unbelievable! I want to resign. - All right. - I really will resign. - Go on. - This won't end here, you'll see! - Go! Darling. Cicci! I've thought about you all day. Your mouth... - Who could that be? - Who? Someone's at the door, go and see. - You're wrong. - Please. - Go and see. - All right. No one's there. - What's the matter? - I want to shower you with kisses! - What's wrong? - Someone's at the door! - Go and see. - No one's there. I'll go then. - My darling! - What's the matter? Slow down! - My darling! - You're excited about your medal? No, not at all. I'm perfectly fine. You don't understand, you don't hear a thing! You heard that? Leave Chicca alone! Excuse me, my dear. I have to go. What? My thing! - My coat! - It's here. Are you leaving? What's the matter? I've never seen you like this. It's nothing. I've never felt so calm. What do you want at this time? Nothing, Mr. Mayor. I came for my thing. You don't believe in ghosts, do you? They're all lies! Why are you laughing? Why didn't you come to the ceremony today? Who do you think you are? Mr. Mayor, I couldn't be there, but I came. Don't you remember? You said hello to me. - Me? - Yes, I went by, on the carriage. Or rather... in it. While you were making your speech. Everyone took their hats off. That was me. So you're... Right, the doctor said so too: "I'm not sure." And then, you know... You just end up... What are you saying? Are you trying to scare me? You? Help! You're a ghost! What do you want, Mr. De Carmine? Tell me! - You want my coat? Take it. - No, Mr. Mayor. You want yours? I'll call the carabinieri, the police, the army and the tanks. No! I see. Here, look. I thought this was very important. But instead... I got it all wrong. - Forgive me, Carmine! - What are you doing, Mr. Mayor? Nothing. I'm no longer the Mayor. I'm an ordinary man. I was wrong, but I'll make amends. I'm still in time to make amends. No excavations, I'll read the requests. I'll see to everything. You'll be pleased. I'll do everything. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I'll look for your coat too. I'm going home now, goodbye. Goodnight, Mr. Mayor.
