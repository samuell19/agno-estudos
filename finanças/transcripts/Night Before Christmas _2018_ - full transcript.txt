♪ ♪ - Elizabeth, are you ready? - Yes, Caroline. - Green binder, we have all the logistics for Senator Green's Christmas party. Red binder is the museum's annual "Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer" Gala. - Okay. And the white binder? - Oh, this is for Lambton's annual Christmas Festival next week. It's snowy and white for Christmas. - Hmm, you are something else, Elizabeth. Christmas is not here yet, ladies. Holiday cheer on your own time. Lambton, now, your friend is the mayor? - Yes, George. We met in college. - You pushed hard to get me to agree to let you do this under Elite Events' banner. Is there something I should know about this George? - Oh, no, he is just a friend. - And do we want something more? - With George? No. Although I did just write a letter to Santa asking to meet my true love. - You what? - My five-year-old niece didn't want to write a letter this year, so I said I would do it if she did. - You're good about getting people to do things they don't want to do, aren't you? - I've been known to get my way on occasion. - Well, this is the first time you'll be taking the lead on an event like this. I know you're tenacious when you sink your teeth into something, but you're really more of a behind-the-scenes binder type. Are you sure you're up for this? - Yes, I am. I have learned so much from you over the last few years, and I'm ready to take the next step. - Okay, just know I will be busy with my own events. I don't have time to worry about some small-town holiday party. - I've got everything under control. - Good, but if anything goes wrong in Lambton, it will reflect badly on me. - I understand. - I hope so. Your job depends on it. - Merry Christmas to you too. - And we have to set up a call with the department heads about the Christmas bonuses. - Yes, Mr. Darcy. - I told you, you can call me William. - Okay, sorry, Mr. Darcy. I'll write that down. - Travis, stop. Relax. Take a breath. It's your first week as my assistant. No one expects you to know everything. You're doing fine. - Thank you. It's an honor to be working for you, sir. - You say that now. Wait until I have you working through Christmas. - Oh, it's not a problem. I can video conference with my family to open presents. It's just like being there. - Timing's not ideal, I know, but I have to complete the sale of my late uncle's estate before the first of the year, otherwise-- eh, I might get it done before Christmas. - It's Pemberley Manor, right? - Yes, Lambton, Connecticut. - I saw pictures of Pemberley. It looks like a nice place to celebrate Christmas. - It is. I spent several there as a boy with my aunt and uncle. It's always very-- it's always very nice. - A big Darcy family holiday? - No, my father was usually traveling on business. - Well, what about this Christmas? - I always work on Christmas, Travis. Morning, Matt. What's wrong, Travis? - I've never been in a helicopter before. - Relax. It's only scary when they fly upside down. That's a joke. - Oh, it was very funny, sir. - Yeah, that's usually the reaction I get when I try to make a joke. That's why it doesn't happen very often. Come on, Travis. Pemberley awaits. [cheerful music] [helicopter blades whirring] ♪ ♪ - George, you're the mayor of Lambton now. Can't you talk him out of selling Pemberley Manor? - I've known William Darcy since law school. Once he makes up his mind about something, it is virtually impossible to talk him out of it. - Tearing down a place like that to build condos isn't right. I remember when they used to decorate it for Christmas, and we'd all go caroling up there. Pemberley Manor is a huge part of Lambton's history. - Jane, it's been empty for years. I mean, there's really nothing we can do about it, okay? Anyway, we've got to focus on this year's Christmas Festival. It's my first one as mayor, and I want this thing to be the biggest and best yet. That's why I hired Elizabeth to do it. - Yes, her plans are ambitious. A tree lighting on the night of the 21st, Santa's Village on the 22nd-- - That's Elizabeth's best idea. It's a great addition to the festival. - A concert on the 23rd followed by a traditional reading of "The Night Before Christmas" on the 24th and ending with a toy giveaway. - Did you hear, Elizabeth got Stan Findlay, the anchorman from the news? I love the way he says, "Action News." - Hopefully he'll leave that part out of the Christmas reading. George, we usually just do one night, a tree lighting and the story. - I know, but I campaigned on making big changes in Lambton, and this is a way to show that I'm actually serious about that. - Are you sure your friend can handle all of these events? - Yeah, I'm sure. She's great. She's, uh, she's pretty amazing, an amazing friend who's gonna be here soon, so make sure she has whatever she needs and you can be her right-hand, so to speak. - I will be happy to help. - It's gonna be a great Christmas.

Oh, my God, it's good to see you. - It's so good to see you too. - You look fantastic. - Thank you. - This is Jane Lucas. She pretty much keeps the town running. - He's just saying that because he doesn't know where we keep the takeout lunch menus. - Hi, it's so great to meet you. - Hi. - George, this is so perfect. I'm already seeing it. I can see the Christmas tree over there, Santa's village over there. - Elizabeth, take a breath. You just got here. - Well, you know me, once I get my mind set on something, it's impossible for me to stop. - You have not changed a bit. - You two met in college? - Yeah, in the classic literature section of the campus bookstore. We bonded over our love of British authors. He actually asked me out. - No, no, no, no. - He asked me out by writing a dinner invitation inside the front cover of a copy of "Jane Eyre." - You two dated. - Just once, and then we decided we were better off friends, right George? - That's right. Well, why don't we go get some coffee and then we can take you on a tour of the town. - Sounds great. - Ah, I should know this already, but how do you take your coffee? - Black. - Okay, I won't let you down. - Good, because your job depends on this. Travis, that was a joke. Oh, Darcy, just accept the fact that you're lousy at jokes. - Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm in a huge hurry. Can I just get one cup of black coffee? - Um, excuse me, sir. There's a line. - I know, I'm so sorry. It's for my boss, and it's my first week, and-- - Hey, it's okay. I know what it's like to have a demanding boss, but you really shouldn't let him get to you like this. - If I don't get this right, I'm gonna lose my job. - He threatened to fire you over a cup of coffee? - Yeah. - Wait, is that him in the Town car? - Yes. - Elizabeth? - I'll be right back. - No, no, no-- I'm so fired. [knocking] - Hi, excuse me. - Hello, can I help you? - Did you really tell your assistant that his job depended on a coffee order? - Yes, but I wasn't serious. It's his first week, and he's still adjusting. - Well, do you know how you can help him adjust? - Hmm? - Don't threaten to fire him over a cup of coffee. - Right, but you see, it was a joke. - Well, clearly, he didn't get it. - No, he didn't, because he is young and new, and perhaps I have a reputation that precedes me. - As being a demanding boss? - Of caring about my business. - Well, I know what it's like to work for a boss who says things like, "Your job depends on it." - Wow, if your boss said that to you, shouldn't you be talking to them through a car window instead of me? - Okay, I'm-- I'm merely suggesting that with holiday spirit upon us, perhaps we could all be a little kinder to our fellow man. - I'm sorry, is this just at Christmas or is this all the time? I'm just wondering if I can ask for a cup of coffee in January or if I'm out of luck all year round. - You know what, I think I've proven my point. - To recap, I should be nicer. - Precisely. - Duly noted. - Good. Merry Christmas. - And to you. - I am in so much trouble. - I can't see who she's talking to. - William Darcy. - Don't worry, Travis. I'm not going to fire you. - Okay. I didn't tell her to do that. I don't even know who she is. - That's too bad. - Do you know who that was? - No, but I'm really glad I don't ever have to deal with him ever again. - Yeah, but, Elizabeth, that was-- - George, I feel really good about what I just did. Is what you want to tell me gonna ruin that? - Probably. - Keep it to yourself. - Now, I know why you want her to plan the Christmas Festival. She gets things done. - Hello. Welcome. - Hi, there. I'm William Darcy. - Yes, yes, you are. It's so nice to meet you, young man. And who's this? - Travis Payne, Mr. Darcy's assistant. - It's nice to meet you as well. - Tell them no. - Welcome to the Pemberley Manor. - I'm sorry, and you are? - I'm the caretaker. You can call me Kristopher. - I thought the caretaker was a Mr. Willoughby? - He was for many years, but when he retired I was more than happy to take over for him. - And why are you putting up Christmas decorations? - Because it's Christmas. - We're only going to be here for a few days until the sale is final, and after that the new owners are going to tear it down. - I know, but that doesn't mean it can't be cheerful while it's still here, does it? She's a grand old lady, she is. - I'll take a look at it and call you back in 40. - How long has it been since you had a visit, Mr. Darcy? - Not since I was a kid. I spent a few holidays here. - That must have been very special. - It was a long time ago. - Why did you decide to sell it now? - My uncle left it to the Darcy Corporation, so it wasn't my decision. It was the Board of Directors'. It didn't make sense to hold on to a house that's been empty for so many years. - Why don't we go inside and let you have a look around? Oh, we could use some light. - Yeah, that's better. - It's quite a staircase, isn't it? Well, I guess this brings back fond memories. - Well, many more fond memories will be made by the people living in the condos they're gonna build here. - I'm sure that's true. Let me show you to your rooms. - I'm so proud of you, George. Mayor? You always wanted to get into politics. - I mean, I would have done it earlier, but my law practice kept me too busy. Then the previous mayor announced she was retiring, and here I am. - Today Lambton, tomorrow the world? - I think mayor is enough for me right now. What about you? What's it like working those fancy, New York parties? - It's not as glamorous as it sounds. I do logistics, so I'm usually in the back making sure everything runs smoothly. - You were always the most organized person in college. The color-coded binders. - Oh, I still use them. I've always believed that life would be so much easier if you could color code everything, family, work, love, although that one would be pretty thin right now. - So no one serious? - There was, but we broke up, so no, not right now, but you never know what might happen. - But you like your job. - I love my job, actually. My boss can be a little-- - Demanding. I mean, at least that's what you told the terrified guy at the cart today. - Right, but I'm learning a lot from her and, hopefully, one day, I'll be able to have a company of my own. - I wish I would have just hired you directly instead of going through Elite Events. - Well, having Caroline on board, even if it's just for her name, is a good thing. Thank you so much for giving me this opportunity. It's going to be great. - With the two of us together, nothing can go wrong. - What happened? - Water main break last night right underneath the town square. - What town square? All I see is a big hole. - Where's the gazebo? - In the big hole. - This is a disaster. There is no way they're gonna get this fixed in time enough for the Christmas Festival. - Well, is there somewhere else we can do it? - Yes, I have spent the last few hours compiling a list of places that have the adequate space and requisite infrastructure to accommodate the festival. - Bowling alley parking lot. - Mr. Dudley's cow pasture? - We would have to move some calves to use that one. - There's no way that anything on here comes close to the magic that the town square creates at Christmas. - We could put some lights on the big hole. - Come on, in a town as charming as Lambton, there's got to be a better place than the field behind Chester's Bait and Tackle Shop. What about the beautiful estate I saw when I drove into town with the white fence and the huge lawn? - That's Pemberley Manor. We used to have events there all the time, but it's being torn down. - When? - After the first of the year. They're putting condos in its place. - Well, if it's not happening until after Christmas, maybe we convince them to let us use it for the festival. - It's worth a shot. Come on, it's this way. - [sighs] - It's perfect. It's so beautiful and there's plenty of room out here. George, imagine it all done up for the Christmas Festival. - Sure, we can string Christmas lights on the big wrecking ball that's gonna be here any day. - I thought you said it wasn't being torn down until the first of the year. Who owns it? - It was Fred and Edith Darcy's house, but they passed away a few years ago, and now their nephew William Darcy is selling it. - Wait, Darcy, as in Darcy Worldwide, that Darcy? - As in the hotels, the airline, and a bunch of other things. - Yeah. - That's the guy I saw earlier. I'm gonna go talk to him. - Aren't you gonna tell her that William Darcy is the same guy she was yelling at in the limo earlier? - What's the fun in that? - George. - Okay. [doorbell chimes] - Elizabeth, there's probably something you should know about William Darcy. - Don't worry, I'll turn on the charm. It won't be a problem. [door opens] Okay we have a little problem. - Yeah. - So sorry to keep you waiting. - Oh, it's all right. Hi, Mr. Darcy, I'm Elizabeth Bennett. - Yes, we've met. And, of course, you know my assistant Travis. - Can I get anyone anything? Coffee? Or, no, maybe not coffee. - We're fine, thank you. - So what can I do for you, Ms. Bennett? - I'm planning this year's Christmas Festival. Are you familiar with it? - Yes, of course. I remember it from when I was a kid. It was very festive. - Yes. Well, usually, it's held in the Town Square, but there's been a water main break, and now we're desperate to find a new location. - Okay, how can I help you? - We were hoping that you would let us use the front lawn of Pemberley. - I'm sorry, that's just not possible. Pemberley's being sold. - And being torn down to make way for condos. I heard. - You don't approve. - [chuckles] I mean, look at this place. George and Jane said it's a really important part of Lambton's history. How could you approve tearing it down? - No one's lived here for a very long time. You prefer it just sit empty? - No, but it's so beautiful. Why not sell it to someone who'll preserve it, or you could donate it and turn it into a museum. Do something that will benefit the community. - Like host a Christmas Festival. - It's not being torn down until the first of the year, right? - Yes, we're hoping to close before Christmas though, if everything goes according to plan, so we don't want to do anything to jeopardize that, and having the entire town traipse all over the front lawn, I'm afraid that creates liability issues. - Well, I'm sure we could figure out something with insurance, right, George? - Elizabeth, I know the festival's important to you, but-- - Yes, it's my first big event, but it's also important to you. It's your first impression as mayor, and it's important to Lambton. - I am so sorry. I'm afraid it's just not possible. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a conference call that I'm late for. - Do you remember the part where we talked about Christmas spirit? - Vividly. - You refusing to save Christmas for the entire town is going to get you on one of Santa's lists. I just don't think it's the right one. - I can't believe this. My first real event on my own and it's ruined. Good thing Caroline's not paying attention to any of this. - It's gonna be fine. Look, we can still make this special. - You're mayor, isn't there some way you can make Darcy do it? Eminent domain or something? - Making him host the Christmas Festival on land that his company owns? I hardly think that's eminent domain. I'm so late getting a tree. What about this one? - No, too scrawny. You're a lawyer. We could sue. - [chuckles] On what grounds? - I don't know, lack of Christmas spirit? - I don't think there's a law for that. - Okay, well then, now, we're back to you being mayor. Have the town council pass a law. - Elizabeth, you got to let this go. How about that one? - Ugh, too fluffy. George, we are not doing the Christmas Festival in a bowling alley parking lot. - Chester said his field's still available. - No, Christmas is supposed to be magical. It's the time of year where people believe anything is possible. It's visions of sugar-plums, not a bait and tackle shop. - Yeah, but isn't that the thing about the magic of Christmas, you can find it anywhere as long as you believe it exists? - Okay, you know what, you did the same thing in college. You would take my arguments and then you would throw it back at me to make a point. - Look, I appreciate your tenacity, I do, but I just don't think we have a choice on this. - Do you know the company that's buying the place? - Yeah, they're based out of Seattle. - Oh, so that means they're still open. - Once Darcy makes up his mind, it is impossible to change it. - Nothing is impossible at Christmas. - Well, apparently finding a perfect Christmas tree is. - That one. - How do you do that? - I have a gift. So about this company in Seattle? [jazzy version of "Deck the Halls" playing] ♪ ♪ - Kristopher. - Oh, Mr. Darcy. I hope I didn't disturb you. When I was puttering around, I came across this record player and a bunch of these old Christmas albums. I just couldn't resist. - I remember these. My aunt used to play these at the holidays almost non-stop. - That must have been very festive. - It was. She taught me how to dance. - Really? - She was a very patient woman. I wasn't very good. - Well, I doubt that she minded in the slightest. - No, it didn't bother her. She loved Christmas. - Who doesn't? Now, if only we could find a way to help out the town and have the Christmas Festival here. - I agree, but as I told the mayor today, my hands are tied. - Well, there's always hope. What we need is something of a Christmas miracle that would untie your hands, so to speak. - Mr. Darcy, I'm sorry to interrupt. - That's okay, Travis. What do you need? - This email just came in for you. It's from the company that's buying Pemberley. - What does it say? - They received a vociferous complaint about their plans to tear down the manor. They'd like us to try to engender some good will with the town before the sale goes through. - Make it seem like they're not just a bunch of heartless land barons. - Well, there is a way to engender good will. [doorbell chimes] - Miss Bennett. - Mr. Darcy. Come with me. [upbeat music] Okay, over there is where we'd have the Christmas tree, with as many lights and ornaments as it can hold without toppling over. - Miss Bennett. - And then over here on this stage, this is gonna be Santa's Workshop. This is where the kids can tell him everything on their wish list. Oh, imagine a choir singing "Deck The Halls." - Yes, of course, but it-- - Okay, and then right here, right here with Pemberley Manor all lit up in the background, this is where Santa will hand out toys to the kids, and they can listen to the reading of "The Night Before Christmas." Doesn't that sound amazing? - Yes, it does. - So, Mr. Darcy, can we please have the Christmas Festival here? - Yes. - I don't understand why you won't save Christmas for an entire-- Did you just say yes? - Yes. - We can have the festival here? - At the risk of sounding like a broken record, yes. - Well, I had a whole speech prepared. - And I would love to hear it at some point, but it's awfully chilly outside right now, and so I'm gonna give you my one condition before I head back inside to get warm. - What's that? - Assuming you're the one who logged the vociferous complaint with the company who's buying Pemberley? - I prefer strongly worded, but... - It's one thing to have them on board, but Darcy is more than just my name. It's a brand, and I don't allow my brand to be used for things that I don't personally oversee, so I would appreciate it if you kept my name out of it. Deal? - Deal. - Maybe this will get me on the nice list. - You know, I'm not actually in charge of that, but I'll put in a good word. - I appreciate that, Miss Bennett. - You know, since we're saving Christmas together, I think you can call me Elizabeth. - Good night, Elizabeth. - Good night, William. ♪ ♪ It's taken us a few days to get all the I's dotted and the T's crossed, but we're finally ready to get started setting up the Christmas Festival.

Good night, Mr. Darcy. - Good night, Kristopher. ♪ ♪ [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ - Elizabeth. - William. Oh, I'm so sorry. I hope I'm not keeping you up with the lights. - No, no. What are you doing out here? - The tree lighting is less than 48 hours away, and there's still so much left to do. - Are you gonna do it all by yourself? - No, but running through the to-do list helps me relax. - Hmm. - See, you're not the only one who rarely takes a day off. - When there's no to-do list, what relaxes you? - Well, there's always a to-do list. I don't know, I, uh-- It's the week before Christmas, so I'd probably baking Christmas cookies or something if there was a kitchen out here. - Pemberley has a kitchen. - I can't believe you had all of these ingredients just laying around. - Kristopher went shopping.

You never fantasized about being a cop or a cowboy? An astronaut? - No. It was impressed upon me from a very early age that the choice of what I wanted to do when I grew up was already made for me. I would take over the company for my father, so... - Well, what about now? If you weren't William Darcy, captain of industry, what would you do? - Bake cookies.

Everyone knows it's at Pemberley and not the Town Square, right? - We put up signs, newspaper ads, TV ads, social media. - Great, so if anyone shows up at the big hole, they have no one to blame but themselves. - Right. - Oh, hi, Elizabeth. - Hi. - Jane? - Right, you have your meeting about Pemberley. Sorry, we'll get out of your way. - Oh, no, that's okay. Why don't we go get some hot chocolate? - Wonderful. Ladies. - Bye, Jane. - Bye, Travis. - Travis is kind of cute. - Is he? I hadn't really noticed. - Really? I saw the way you guys smiled at each other. - It was just a smile. I was being friendly. Do you think he smiled at me? - Definitely. - I don't know, we're very different. I'm very organized and he's not. - You know what they say, opposites attract. - Is that what's going on with you and Mr. Darcy? - No, he's not just opposite, he's like a different species. - Mm-hmm. A very handsome one. - Well, there's nothing going on with me and Mr. Darcy. - Well, there's nothing going on between me and Travis. - Okay, then. I'm glad we got that settled. - Me too. - [chuckles] Okay, so, here we are. [cheerful music] - I got the draft of the final documents from the bank. There're here somewhere, sorry. - Relax, Travis, you're doing great. - You're just saying that 'cause you don't want Elizabeth coming after you again, right? - Probably, yeah. That was a joke, that was a joke. - Jane is trying to teach me how to be more organized, but I don't know. - Jane, she seems like a lovely young woman. - Oh, she is. She's-- She's very nice. - So, yeah, I have to review the final draft and then the sale of Pemberley will be complete. I should have it all wrapped up by Christmas Eve. - You sure you want to go through with it? - Of course.

If this doesn't go well, I'm gonna have to find a new career. - You just need to relax. - What do you suggest, making more cookies? - No, but I may know something else that could distract you for a few minutes. May I show you? - Sure. Okay. - Okay. - Can I open them? - Yeah. I thought it was something else we could offer at the festival, horse-drawn carriage rides around the property or even the town. - This is incredible. - We're gonna have to fix it up a little bit, you know, some paint, maybe add some more Christmas decorations, that is, if there's any left in town after you bought them all. - I'll go see what I can find. - I can't remember the last time I took a carriage ride. - I do. Kind of wish I didn't. - Wasn't a good memory? - It was just my ex-fiancé Jeff. - Oh, well, I'm sorry I brought that up. - No, it's fine. I mean, we loved each other and that's not a terrible thing even if it doesn't work out, right? - How long were you two together? - Two years. I wish I could say that there was something big that made us break up, or something dramatic that I could point to and be like, "Yeah, that, that's the reason." Like, he loves pineapple on his pizza, and I can't stand it. - Oh, yeah, that would be grounds for a break-up, as far as I'm concerned. - Yeah, really, we just-- we lost each other and we couldn't seem to figure out our way back. - I'm familiar with that. - One of your models? - No, she was a teacher, and it was a similar thing. It was great until it wasn't. - But you want that again? I mean, the great part? - Of course, you? - Yeah. I actually--you're gonna think it's ridiculous, but one of my nieces didn't want to write a letter top Santa this year, so I wrote one to convince her it was worth doing. - What did you wish for? - Okay, you promise not to laugh? - I promise. - I asked for true love. - Why would I laugh at that? - Well, hopefully, my niece has more luck with her wish than I did with mine. - It's four days left until Christmas, so, you never know. - [chuckles] You never know. - Elizabeth, the reporter for the Mansfield press is here for you. - Okay, great. I'll be right up. - The Mansfield Press. Fancy. You've hit the big time. - Anything for publicity. Hey, thank you for this. This is a really good idea. [indistinct chatter] - Oh, there you are. Just look at all those people. - It is quite a crowd. - The water main break may have been a blessing in disguise.

The headline was right. You saved Christmas. - Oh, hardly, no. Regardless, I don't need that kind of credit. - You allowed the festival to take place here so that the town felt better about what was happening at Pemberley. What's wrong with taking credit for that? - Well, that was more for the company buying it than for me. - William, there's nothing wrong with people knowing that you're a good guy. - Elizabeth. We have a problem. - Oh, good. I was wondering what else could go wrong. - The man who was going to play Santa Claus has come down with the flu. He's not going to be able to make it. - What are we going to do? We have a line of kids out there waiting to talk to Santa. - Well, we're just gonna have to find a new one.

Would you like to tell Santa what you want for Christmas? Bicycle and a doll. Nice choice. Merry Christmas. - Are you sure you don't want to go out there, join in on the fun? - No, I'm fine.

But I can't help wonder what it would be like if she would have said yes for a second. - What happened? - She wanted to be friends. You know, and I wanted her in my life, so at the time, that was good enough for me. - What about now? - Now? I can't help but wonder what she would say if I asked again. Maybe it would be different. - Okay, so we're making some good progress, and we found almost everything that the kids asked for. - Good, good, good. How much do we have left? - I think half the list? - Stop it, half? If we put anything else in this car, we're gonna have to sit on top. - It worked for the Christmas tree. - Do you always see the bright side? - I mean, it's three days until Christmas. It's a beautiful night. It's a beautiful town. We're buying presents for kids who don't often get presents. It doesn't get much better than that. - Point taken. - What do you want for Christmas? - I have everything I need. - Okay, what do you want? You can't possibly have everything you want. - The same thing everyone else wants, to be happy and satisfied in a job well done. - So family, friends, love? - Of course. - Well, maybe you should put that in your letter to Santa. - Perhaps. - Oh, hey, do you think George would like this scarf?

Do you know how long I have been trying to plan an event with his company? - Yeah, but it's not with his company. It's with the town of Lambton. - Elizabeth, your picture is in the paper as Darcy's event planner. - That was a mistake. - Oh, I'll say. Do you know what that picture makes me look like? - Smart for hiring such capable people? - It makes me look irrelevant.

Well, over here, this is where we'll serve hot chocolate and people can sit and relax, mingle with their neighbor. - Hay? No, Elizabeth, people can't sit on hay, no, no, no. We need tables, silver tablecloths, white chairs--it all needs to be much more elegant. Are you writing this down? - Yeah. - Okay, great. Moving on. - What are you doing? - Wrapping the kids' Christmas gifts. - Are you angry at the gifts? - I've just never done something like this by myself, but there's nothing wrong with the way these gifts are wrapped, provided my intention was to frighten the children. Are you going to help me or not? - I need to tell you something. - Oh-oh, what else did I do wrong? - No, it's actually something that I did wrong. My boss Caroline is here. - Why? - She's a little concerned with the extra attention the festival's getting. - Because of the photo of us in the paper. - Yeah, so she's gonna be taking the lead for the rest of the event. She's outside making changes and talking to George right now, and then I'll introduce you to her. - But you've been doing a great job. - Oh, thank you for saying that. I mean, I'll still be here, I just will be a little bit more behind the scenes where I belong. - I don't think you belong behind the scenes. I think you belong out front. I'd be happy to tell her that. Perhaps I should knock on her car window and remind her about being kind to the people who work for her. - William, no. Don't, okay? Let's just focus on making Christmas wonderful for everyone and it'll be fine. - Mr. Darcy, there's someone here to see you. - Mr. Darcy, I'm Caroline Bingley. Such a pleasure to meet you. - Hi. Likewise. - Let's chat about this amazing festival and how we can truly make it spectacular.

I'll just radio the driver to come back. - That's all right. I'm happy to wait. Do you mind, Elizabeth? - No, not at all. - Okay, let me know if you change your mind. - Thank you. So how do you feel now that Caroline's taken over the festival? - I mean, she knows what she's doing. I'm actually surprised she hasn't changed more. How was lunch with her? - It was good. She tried to get me to be more forthcoming about my involvement about my involvement with the festival, but I made it very clear that I don't want any publicity. - Hasn't that ship already sailed because of me? - Any more publicity. - Right. How did she take it? - She can be charming when she wants to be, but don't worry, I didn't say anything about her taking over the festival. - Thank you. - But you should be very proud of what we've accomplished. Here we go. - Oh. - All right. A special ride for a special V.I.P. - Thank you. - Okay. - I think we can take it from here. - Of course.

I'll head to my parents' house right after we wrap up. - Christmas morning with your family. - Mm-hmm. - That sounds perfect. - Mm-hmm. What about you? Are you still working that day? - I don't know, maybe I'll take the day off for once. Possibly. We'll see. - Really? - Maybe one last Christmas at Pemberley. - Well, is that why you decided to come here personally instead of sending someone who works for you? - I guess it is. Pemberley has a lot of powerful memories for me. I couldn't let that go without at least saying good-bye. - Why are you selling it at all? - The Board of Directors decided that our company needed to sell it. - Yeah, but I'm sure you could talk to them and change their mind. Why not tell them how important it was to you? - Well, the board has been there forever, and my father-- [chuckles] he would never have let something like fond childhood memories interfere with a business decision. - You're not your father. - But sometimes I need to be. - Well, maybe a Christmas at Pemberley will change your mind. If it doesn't, I don't know what else will. - Me neither. - Welcome back. How was your carriage ride, Mr. Darcy? - It was lovely. - Oh. Excellent. Well, perhaps, I should give it a go.

You don't have time to put it back together all by yourself. - I won't be by myself, I called some friends to help. [cheerful music] Caroline, look, I know that you said that I belong behind the scenes, but this festival is more important than the both of us. It's about making sure that this entire town experiences the joy of Christmas, and I can make that happen, as long as you'll let me. - What can I do to help? - There you go. - This is getting ridiculous. - Where are you going? - I'm gonna go talk to the pilot, find out what the delay is. - The weather, remember? - It's barely even snowing. Helicopters can fly in the snow. - I'll do it. I can do it. - I'm gonna go get an update. - I'll do it. I can do it. - No, it's fine, I got it. - It's not the weather. - It's not? - The helicopter's ready. It has been for a while now. - Well, why haven't we left yet? - Because you're not supposed to leave. - I'm not? - No, you're supposed to remember that it's Christmas, and that anything is possible at Christmas, and that you shouldn't sell Pemberley, and that you love Elizabeth, and she loves you. So I had to pretend that the helicopter wasn't working and keep you here until you did remember all that. - You think Elizabeth loves me? - I know she does. And I know I don't know you very well yet, Mr. Darcy, but I know that you could really use someone like her in your life, especially at Christmas. That's what it's all about, right? - We're going back to Pemberley Manor. We have a Christmas Festival to get to. ♪ ♪ Thank you, Travis. - Have you seen Kristopher? I can't find him anywhere. - Well, he's our Santa. - Yeah, bad news. Stan Findlay, the anchorman who was gonna read "The Night Before Christmas," his wife just went into labor. - Okay, nobody panic. George, you hand out the toys to the kids, and I'll read the story. - I don't have a Santa suit, and they're expecting a celebrity to read to them. - I know it's not perfect, but unless there's a Christmas miracle, it'll have to do. - Still no luck. I can't get a signal. The snow must have knocked out all the cell towers. - I'll try mine. [bells ringing] Kristopher, is that you? - Yes, William. I've come to give you a lift back to Pemberley. - Did you drive your car out here? - Uh...[chuckles] something like that. You'll see. You know, I thought it was all set up. Elizabeth wrote her Christmas letter looking for true love. The two of you should have been able to figure that out on your own, but here I am, it's Christmas Eve, needing to drop everything to make sure that you understand that Christmas is not just sitting in a big house watching the festivities through the window and that she gets her Christmas wish. - What are you talking about? - Well, it's a long story. Come on, come on. [indistinct chatter] - Elizabeth, we can't wait any longer. - Okay, let's do this. [bells jingling] - William. - It's Kristopher too. - So sorry we're late. We had a little, uh, car trouble. Right, Mr. Darcy? - Yeah, car trouble. - But we're here now, ready to read "The Night Before Christmas" and hand out some presents. - Well, the guy that was supposed to read it never showed, so I'm taking over. - Actually, you know what, Elizabeth, may I do it? I think it's time that I partake in the Christmas festivities instead of just watching them from the window of my house. - Your house? I thought you were-- - I talked to the Board, the sale's off. [laughter] - Okay, well, everyone's waiting, so are you ready? - Remember what Kristopher said, "The things you love are never too far away." - Okay. - Ladies and gentlemen, reading "The Night Before Christmas," William Darcy. [cheers and applause] - All right. - "Twas the night before Christmas when all through "the house not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. "The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, "in hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there. "The children were nestled all snug in their beds, "while visions of sugar plums danced in their heads. "And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap, "had just settled down for a long winter's nap, when out on the lawn there arose such a clatter..." - Thank you, Kristopher. - It's my pleasure, Elizabeth. And I hope that you get what you wanted for Christmas. - I already have. [both chuckle] - "He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, "and away they all flew like the down of a thistle. "But I heard him exclaim, ere he rode out of sight, Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night." [cheers and applause] - All right. - Merry Christmas, everyone. [gentle music] - Merry Christmas! Who wants some presents? Ha! Come on up. [indistinct chatter] How 'bout you, my friend? - I thought you didn't like speaking in public. - Had to try and make it onto the nice list. - Well, I think you did. ♪ ♪
