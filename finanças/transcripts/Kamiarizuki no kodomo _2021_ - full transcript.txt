That hurts. Kanna. Mom. Are you okay? I'm fine. Do you want to stop? I am fine! Sorry. Then... you can still run? Yeah. The race isn't over yet. And I wasn't even trying that hard. You really hate losing. I don't know who you take after. All right! Let's go! On your marks! - Get set... - Go! Kanna, come on! Uh-oh, you're gonna get left behind. Hey, tagger, this way Follow the clapping hands Come on! Look who's smiling now. What? Hey, Mom! Wait! Hey! Don't leave me! GODS NO GODS "Kanna month." Wha... Here! What? What is it, Hayama? - Feeling self-conscious? - Sorry. Or are my classes really that boring? Kind of? Honestly. Okay, back to it. September is Naga month. Page 125. October is Kanna month. Kanna month? That's not what my grandma says. Yes. It's apparently different in the Izumo region in Shimane. I believe... it would be Kamiari month. Kamiari month? In Izumo legends, they say that the Yaoyorozu gods gather at the Izumo Taisha shrine and hold a matchmaking gathering called Kamihakari. Nowadays, you might call it a holy summit. - A summit? - That's weird. - Off topic again. - Yeah. Kamihakari is held in October of the old lunar calender. Most places in Japan lose their gods at that time. Thus "Kanna month." At the same time, the gods gather together in Izumo. - On your marks! - In other words, there are gods. That's why, in Izumo, they refer to October as Kamiari month. That's why. Get set! The boys are slow. - Yeah. - Don't run so sluggishly! At that rate, you won't be able to finish the race next week! Why is he making us run now? Seriously. Practicing now isn't going to help. But I heard a typhoon's coming. - Really? Let's pray for rain. - Oh, that's me. Rain down Rain! Ooh, rain! Honestly. Boys are really stupid. Oh, dear. Kanna? What's wrong? I'm out of shape for the race. Maybe I should pray for rain too. - Really? - Rain Make it rain All right. The girls are next. First group, your turn. Yamamoto, Ogawa, Hayama, Murayama. Where's Ogawa? Hey! Ogawa! Here! On your marks! Get set! - Teacher. - What's wrong? I've got a leg cramp. Kanna, are you okay? I'm fine. I must not be exercising enough. - I'm going to the nurse's office. - If you must. Kanna, I'll go with you. I'm okay on my own. All right. On your marks. It is now the end of the school day. To anyone still at school, please be careful on your way home. Look at this, Shiro. Shiro. Must be nice. I can't imagine you worry about much. Shiro, I haven't told anyone how I really feel. Hey! Whoever gets to my place first can choose which game we play. All right! I think running just isn't... Kanna! Let's go home! On my way. See you. I was looking for you. Sorry. You really like rabbits, don't you? They're cute. Is your leg better now? It still kind of feels funny. BUNNY HOUSE Goodbye. Goodbye! Those pigeons are scary. Hey, Kanna? You don't have to force yourself to run in the marathon next week. I said my leg is fine. That's not what I mean. It's only been a year. - I'm sure the teachers would... - Look. My dad said he's coming to watch. He's all excited about it. So I have to do it. Kanna. Plus, none of the boys are even trying. At least we girls should! You're right. Anyhow, let's go home. Why don't we have some of your favorite zenzai first? Good idea. My mom says I have to hurry home. Okay. - I'm really sorry. - It's nothing. Now that you mention it, I have something to do too. See you tomorrow. Till tomorrow. Okay then. I'm so... PARK FRONT APARTMENTS Then An got angry. Oh, my. And then what? Then Tae had to apologize. Mama, what's for dinner? What should I make? Maybe curry? What, curry again? I want something else. Bye-bye! Bye-bye. KANNA'S MARATHON HONORABLE MENTION - MARATHON KANNA HAYAMA I'm home. What's the matter? The lights aren't on. Welcome home, Dad. I just got home too. I see. - Kanna. - Yeah? It's next week, right? The marathon. Thank you. You didn't have to. What? These are too small. I'm a size five now. You are? I messed up. Five... Five, right? - I'll go exchange them. - That's okay. - I'll wear the ones I always do. - Kanna. Next week, will you really be able to run? I'm fine. I'll hurry and make dinner. Yayoi. SCHOOL MARATHON Your rain song did nothing. - My kids don't study at home. - Mine neither. Please rain The boys are chipper, aren't they? Yeah. Kanna! Miki! - How are you feeling? - Not too bad. Hi, Kanna. Hello! Miki's mom! Thank you for being so kind to my daughter. Not at all. Likewise. - You gave her cake the other day. - Hey, knock it off. - It's fine. Really. - Let's go. Your dad is so funny. He's so enthusiastic. It's so embarrassing. Well, everybody, unfortunately, it's a cloudy day. We can go from here, right? I think we'll be okay. - Let's go for it! - Yeah. All right! On your marks! Get set! Kanna, good luck! Kanna's going to be fine. That's right. The lead has returned! - You can do it! - Go! Miki's fast! Kanna made it too. - Go for it! - You can do it! Amazing! She passed another runner! Kanna! - Are you okay? - I'm fine. - Miki, you were so fast! - Kanna! You can do it! You can do it, Kanna! Kanna! Kanna! Keep going! Kanna! Kanna! Kanna? What happened? Are you okay? You don't have to push yourself. I'm not... pushing myself. Look. You remember what your mother always said? Crossing the finish line is more important than being the first to cross it. - Don't say that. - What? Stuff that mom said. Don't say stuff like you understand! Kanna. Kanna. Wait. Kanna, wait! Kanna! - Kanna? - Kanna! Kanna! Everybody go to your classrooms! Hey, you! Kanna! Mom! Why? Why? I want to see you. What... is this? I'm sor... No! Leave this to me. Thank you. That amulet. Is that Yayoi's? You know my mom? - Who are you? - That's nothing you need to know! Remove Yayoi's amulet, human. What? Amulet? Take that off your wrist! A demon? Stop it! Just hand it over! Shiro? Be gone, demon! You spoke? You must not remove that bracelet! Damn it, here already. Even without taking the amulet from you, I can still take over the task of the Idaten! I won't let you. This child is Yayoi's daughter. We don't need a replacement! No matter. You will soon be exposed anyway. You're Shiro, aren't you? How do you know my mother? That's because I am a messenger of the gods and because your mother was the previous Idaten-shin. What's... an Idaten-shin? A fast runner. Something like a god of running. My mom is a god? A descendant of gods, to be accurate. That guy back there is a descendant of demons who hate the Idaten. It's okay. I was sent to protect you from bad types like that so that you can complete your task. So you're not Shiro then? It was an emergency, so I took Shiro to use as my yorishiro. - In other words, I borrowed its body. - What does that mean? As soon as the descendant wearing the Idaten amulet appeared... in other words, you... I came as soon as I could. You're telling me, out of the blue, that my mom was the god of running. I'm also a newcomer who has been sent as a substitute, so I don't know much about Yayoi. At any rate, I'm glad I found you! Now let's go to Izumo and carry out our task. What? Wait a minute. What task? The task of the Idaten is to bring the chiso for the gods' feast. We will deliver it for the festival that will be held in Izumo this evening. That's why we must hurry! Deliver? Tonight? Isn't Izumo in Shimane? How will we get there? We'll do it with that amulet. Look. Take a good look around you. It's moving, but really slowly. Yes. When a descendant of the Idaten wears that, the flow of time around them slows down. That amulet gives an Idaten the special power to run fast enough to alter space-time. Normal humans are not aware of us. Wow. Even though I said "tonight," that refers to human time. As you can see, in Idaten space-time, time moves slowly. Is that... For example, five days here are only about one hour in the human world. - That's all? - Yes. So by those calculations, if we go now, we can make it. That makes sense. Do we take a bus or something? Or the bullet train? Come on. We're running... with these legs! We're running? To Izumo? Why would we get on the slow bullet train? Well... But I'm sorry. I can't go with you. You have to. If we don't make it to the festival that begins tonight and they don't hold the Kamihakari tomorrow, then the fate of next year... Kamihakari. That is... We have to hurry! Otherwise, we won't make it! It's impossible! - You can't just tell me that! - Why? Why? Running? To Izumo? Impossible. It's far away. Also, I can't really run anymore. Don't you want to know how your mother felt when she ran? What? If we follow the road your mother traveled to Izumo, see the scenery she saw and come into contact with those she met, surely we could also make it to your mother's! Maybe. I see! It's a festival where the gods gather, isn't it? Then surely Mom will be there also! - What should I do? - Well, no. - In Izumo, the country of the gods... - I can see my mom! ...there is a legend of a place where the two worlds connect... - It's true, right, what you just said? - Well... I can see her once again, right? I can see Mom once again? If it's fate. I'll go! I'm going to see my mom! DOUGHNUTS - NOODLES The task of the Idaten is to gather the autumn bounty that grows in every region... in short, the chiso... and to carry it to the gods who gather in Izumo. - What's a chiso? - A banquet. You know, food. We're not only running, but also gathering food? Yes. That's where the word "chiso" comes from. Seeking bounty and running through the regions. It is the most important task of the Idaten. In October of the old lunar calendar... in Kamiari month... all the gods in Japan gather in one place in Izumo and hold a matchmaking gathering, as well as the Kamihakari. But in their absence, there are caretaker gods who watch over to make sure no disasters occur. They are called Rusu gods. So we go around getting the food from all of those gods and messengers and bring it to the Yaoyorozu gods who have gathered in Izumo. That's why we must make it in time for the festival tonight that welcomes them. At what time do we need to be at the festival tonight? We need to get there by 7:00 tonight when the festival begins. That soon? But it's still afternoon. I see. Until you get used to it, I will be sure to properly warn you about the flow of time. Warn me? I'm kind of like the timekeeper in a marathon, if you will. Now then. Allow me to guide you to Izumo. Yes, please! Dad. He was looking for me. He was worried about me. What's the matter? Let's hurry up and go! Okay. You'll catch a cold. I'm going now. I'm going to see Mom. - Now let's go. - Okay. A gourd? No. It's nothing. Come to think of it, how do you gather chiso anyway? That's right. We should stop at that shrine from before first. What? We're going to see that monster again? It is not a monster. It is a god. Fearsome god! We have come to gather chiso to deliver to Izumo. This is chiso? Mochi? That's right. That's the specialty from around here. We get something that is related to the land and to the god. This god wards off evil, so you want to take this at the beginning of your journey. - This god wards off evil? - Yes. There is a god of weather, a god of entertainment. There's even a toilet god. There are gods who bring a variety of benefits to this country. I see. I came here every day, but I never thought about that before. Is that so? What? It says it has been watching you ever since you were a child. It also knows you cried here by yourself. I don't remember anything like that. Well... I'm sorry I didn't notice you until now. It says, "When you get tired from running, walk." We will be on our way. Shiro. What about this? Oh, yes. Here. Awesome. It's like magic! This is the power of the gods. With this, we can carry a lot of chiso, and gourds rarely break. It protects the delicacies. But be careful. There are entities that want to steal the gourd. Like from before? That was Yasha. He is from a clan of demons who've held a grudge against the Idaten for generations. A grudge? Anyway, it absolutely must not be stolen. So always keep it with you. Okay. I'll be looking out, too, so we should be fine. Shall we go then? Yes. I humbly accept! USHIJIMA SHRINE No matter how much time slows down, if you keep on dillydallying, we'll run out of daylight. Being able to see life in the city slowed down this way is like a dream. That's true. This journey might be a lot of fun. Don't say that. It's not going to be that easy. Why? I told you. There are many kinds of gods. ATAGO SHRINE I'm going to burn up! EBARA SEVEN FORTUNATE GODS RITUAL OF PURIFICATION RUB THE WHITE SERPENT KO SHRINE STORK SHRINE Wait. Stop! Stop it! Are you okay? I am good. You're lying. You're not all right, are you? That's right. I'm sleepy. We've been running all day long. Can you actually make it to Izumo? It hasn't even been ten minutes. You're talking about real time. I thought an Idaten had more strength. I'm still just a sixth-grader. Then why don't we take a break under the bridge over there? Hooray! I get to sleep! DON'T GET IN AN ACCIDENT. YOUR FAMILY IS WAITING FOR YOU! It says "Kanna River." That's my name. "Kanna" because you were born in Kanna month, right? Yeah, that's right. Being named after your birth month is too plain. Is it? I don't think so. I can't sleep. It's too bright. You have no choice. Even the sun has slowed down. She fell asleep. Shiro? You slept too much. Good morning. We have to hurry up, or we won't make it. I'm not that tired. Perhaps that is an effect of the amulet too? That's amazing. Where's the gourd? Underneath my blanket. - What? - It's him! What are you doing, you ragged demon? That's valuable. Please give it back. No way. Didn't I tell you you'd be exposed? You don't have what it takes. You're a mere human and, on top of that, a child. You're not an adult either. If you really want this back, have a footrace with me! A footrace? Do you remember what I said about the demons? They've held a grudge against Idaten for many generations. That's right. They always challenge you to a race. A mere messenger like you should not speak of our history! My ancestor was Sokushikki, the demon god that was a swift runner. After they obtained the bones of their beloved Buddha, your ancestor, Idaten, chased after them. Then, captured, our clan was deposed... no longer the gods they were. "Beloved Buddha"? What you mean is that you stole them! Such insolence! Since then, his clan has held a grudge against the Idaten for generations, and they keep challenging Idaten in order to regain their status as gods. I see. Come on and face me! We don't have time for that! That's right. I'm not even that fast. - And I don't feel like run... - Here! Don't you want it back? Ready? Whoever reaches him first wins. Get ready, Kanna! On your marks, get set, go! Yeah! Finally! That'll teach you, you Idaten-spewing child! You did it. Yasha wins. Did you get your revenge for your clan? You must surely feel better. You don't need the gourd anymore, do you? No. Wait a minute! Are you really going to go to Izumo running like that? You're just too fast, Yasha. Yeah, I gu... That's not what I mean! Enough. We had the race. I'm taking the gourd! Why? We raced like we were supposed to. Aren't you happy? Yayoi was faster. I knew it! You've met my mom, haven't you? So what if I did? Tell me about my Idaten mother! Not mischievous like you. She was... She was unmistakably Idaten. She ran so beautifully that I was enchanted. That's right. Messenger rabbit, take me with you. What? Why? There's no point in beating you unless it's in front of the gods. Excuse me? We'll have a legitimate race, and I will take over your role. Then I will return to the seat of the gods and restore my clan. No. Absolutely not! Shiro, say something! It actually might not be a bad idea. But, Shiro... To be honest, you were faster by far when you ran with Yasha than when you ran by yourself. Really? Having someone to compete against might not be a bad idea. Then it's decided. Thanks for having me, Idaten... human! CENTRAL MOUNTAIN ROUTE Kanna! Wake up, Kanna. Look, it's already morning, Kanna. Just a little longer. Here we go! One, two, three! It's so bright! We're grateful for this meal! Hey, Shiro. Wake up. I've finally won. I've finally beat the tortoise. I said wake up! What's the matter? All you did was sleep before. Let's hurry up. We don't have time. Come on, hurry. Wait a minute. What's gotten into you all of a sudden? What's wrong? Just now... I felt like somebody was watching us. There's nothing here. I don't sense any gods either. Is this the Suwa Taisha shrine? That's right. There is a god who is the child of Okuninushi No Mikoto, the greatest god in Izumo. The chiso here is exceptionally important, so be careful when receiving it. Got it! SUWA SHRINE Excuse me? No. The sacred object is farther back. In the back? Face that way and introduce yourself in a loud voice. God of Suwa, I have arrived. I am Kanna. You think he'll hear you like that? Yell louder. I have arrived! I am Kanna! Louder! Make it echo to Lake Suwa! God of Suwa! I am Kanna! An earthquake? No... way. Are you the one who is calling me, tiny human? What on earth do you want? This is the first time I've made your acquaintance, mighty Dragon God. We have come to receive chiso on our way to Izumo. Might this even smaller creature be the White Hare of Inaba? If that is true, then that one must be an Idaten. Yes. Come on, greet him. Okay. I am Kanna Hayama. Pleased to meet you. But I thought you would not come this year. Yes, there were various matters. However, we thought we might still make it. Although this is abrupt, might we obtain some chiso? No. I will not give you chiso. Well, why not? Is it because we were late? Human, do you really have what it takes to be an Idaten? Why don't you have a look at the amulet on her wrist? I'm being impertinent and rude. What's stupid is a lowly messenger like you. The road ahead to Izumo will be even more treacherous and severe. Are you prepared to go through with this and carry out your mission? Of course! You stink. You stink of deception! You are hiding something. Dragon God! Please! Give me your chiso. I'll get to Izumo. I have to go on! Tiny human. If you say such things, then I shall test your resolve. Down this road, there is a sky shrine called Hokuto. I have prepared the chiso there. Go through this raging path and make it to Hokuto. With all due respect, is this not a trial for gods? This would be reckless for a descendant, much less a human. And certainly for a child! Shiro. In that case, I guess it's my turn. Another complication. I'm not half-baked like this kid. Half-baked? Dragon God! Let's say whoever completes this trial will be deemed ready for the task and gets the chiso? Descendant of the demon god, is that the task you seek? Wait a minute! Human, if you don't want that to happen, do it even if it costs you your life. If your resolve is true, that is. All right. Here I go. Kanna! Be careful! I can't bear to watch! No matter what, I'm going to see Mom. There it is. Excuse me! I've been trained differently than you. Yasha! The path! You have to hurry! Otherwise, we won't be able to get the chiso! But... Kanna! Climb up! Quick! Why did you... I have to go on. Look out! Kanna! Mom. Wow. It's lovely. Your trial ended in failure. Yes. However, I have one question for you, tiny human. Why must you go to Izumo? For the feast for the gods. Your true reason! Because I want to see my mom in Izumo. Can you see your mother in Izumo? Yes. Then why did you throw that away to save the life of a demon? Because I don't want to see that. I don't want to see anybody disappear. I see. I shall entrust the chiso to you. Why? For I, too, am a child of Okuninushi No Mikoto. However, because of an ancient oath, I entered into a contract to pay for this land. OKUNINUSHI SHRINE Since then, I have not been able to see my parents. Not being able to see one's parents again. It's a feeling I understand very well. It hurts. Even if we cannot meet again, our bond will never cease to exist. You must get to Izumo in time for the matchmaking gathering. I will. Kanna! Are you okay? Shiro! Idaten. Here. - What is it? - It is the chiso from this region. Thank you, Dragon God! There will be trouble If you do not arrive in time for the festival tonight. What will happen if we don't make it? Then the Yaoyorozu gods will not be able to be in Izumo for that month. That means... Kamiari month will become Kanna month. The matchmaking gathering won't be held in the years to follow, and this island country will be greatly shaken. Go, Idaten! Hurry! I was really worried. That took a lot of heart. I'm sorry. But the result turned out all right. Hey, human! Yasha. Why did you save me? What do you mean why? My clan loathes the Idaten. And I'm also trying to steal your role. I don't know. But... I know that if you weren't here, it would have been even harder for me to run. Running this far was kind of fun. Okay, we're off. You are a blockhead! At this rate, you'll never make it to the festival. So I'll teach you the proper way to run. What? So... I'm saying that I'll teach you how to run on the road to Izumo. Yasha! He'll find any excuse to go. Let's hurry. The sun will be setting soon. Come on, hurry! Hey! Don't pull! More like this. SUGA SHRINE CHIE NO YU HOT SPRING You don't have to see me off! Let's go already. You've come a great distance. It's been such a trying journey. However, I can't believe this little kid is an Idaten. You're almost out of time. Will you be okay? No need to worry with this one. That's right! Kanna can do it! Is that right? Well, I'm counting on you. This last chiso is exceptional good luck! Thank you! And thanks to you. Now we've gathered the chiso! - Finally. - Yeah. You're not alone. You don't have to do it all yourself. Take care of yourself. Okay. Let's get moving! Right! It won't mean a thing if we don't make it! It's just a bit further to Izumo. Let's take a break before the final spurt. We have a bit of time before the festival begins. It's beautiful. This is the first time I've seen stars in the sky like this. It's great. I'm glad I came. Just a little longer. Yasha, are you awake? I'm not asleep. Thanks for before. "Before?" What you said to Ebisu. I said something? You said there was nothing to worry about with me. It kind of made me feel happy. I thought maybe you came to feel that way because of this journey. Yeah. You kind of remind me of Yayoi. What do you mean? You have similarities. The will to win, the inability to give up. We're not alike at all. I thought I wanted to be like my mom, to run like her. But... You're still a kid. You're wrong. If I could have run faster, that never would have happened. "That"? My mom died because of me. So, at first, I wanted to see her. But also, I didn't want to. But as I've been learning more and more about the role she played, I hope I can be helpful in taking her place. I wonder if she'll see me if I can run all the way to Izumo. I loved running with my mom. Come on! You'll be left behind! Wait, Mom! I was proud of my mom. I always wanted to run like my mom someday. But... Mom! What's wrong? Are you okay? I'm going to get Dad! It's okay. I just got a little dizzy. Mom, you don't have to come to the marathon tomorrow. Don't worry. You have an early day tomorrow. Off to bed. Come on. You won't be able to run if you don't get enough sleep. You're winning first place after all. Yeah. SCHOOL MARATHON I knew it. I knew she wasn't well. But she said if I tried my best, she would try her best. Kanna! You can do it! She made herself come see me. But I... HONORABLE MENTION - MARATHON Mom. Mom. Mom. Mo... Kanna's so brave. She didn't shed a single tear. It's tough on the husband too. I heard she was actually supposed to stay in bed, and yet she went to the marathon. What? In this weather? Why did they let her be so reckless? What do you know about me and my mom? USHIJIMA SHRINE It's my fault. It's my fault Mom died. What will you do when you see Yayoi? I'll say it. I'll tell her. That you're sorry you couldn't help her? That too. Also, I'll ask her if I can stop running. What? I don't have talent like my mom. I think I always knew, but I missed the chance to say it. I won't ever win, and, when I run, it's painful. I wanted to tell her that, that it wasn't for me. Like the gods would say, it wasn't my fate. - Are you serious? - What? Do you really want to quit running? Can you say that is what you sincerely want? Didn't you just put in all that work to run this far? You're going to quit running? Are you saying that you ran all this way just to do that? On top of that, what about when you used to run with Yayoi? Were your feelings a lie back then too? Yasha, have you been running since you were little? What? Yeah. My parents are clan leaders. I was training day in and day out. I've never done anything else. No way. Haven't you heard about my ancestors? When my clan lost its status as gods, it had no place to go. We've been in a feud with the Idaten for generations. But we've never beaten them. So my clan wants me to win. They keep pushing me. If I can beat an Idaten, then... Then? Nothing. When we complete this journey, you must race me one more time. Okay, I will! I won't cut you any slack, so you better be ready. The same goes for you! Big words coming from a blockhead! By the way, how are you going to find Yayoi? Actually, how is it relevant to your task as an Idaten? Don't you know? In Izumo, there is a place that leads to that other world. Who told you that? Shiro did. What's wrong? I see. Well, that will be fun. Yeah. Go to sleep now. If you keep dawdling, you'll never make it on time. You're right. - Good night. - Yeah. Kanna. Kanna. Mom? Kanna. Kanna. Kanna. Kanna. Mom? Kanna. Mom. Mom! Mom... I've missed you so much, Kanna. Hey! Wake up! - What is it? - Kanna isn't here! She and the gourd are both gone! What's wrong? Shiro and Yasha are probably worried. It's okay. Don't worry. There's no need to be concerned about that. But what about my task? You always stuck it out. - You were always pushing yourself. - What are you talking about? You just wanted to see me. You pretended to take on the task of an Idaten in order to do that. Didn't you? Deep down, you didn't really care about the task, did you? It's okay. You don't need to think about others. You don't have to put up with it anymore. You don't have to push yourself anymore. It's fine to only think about yourself. Because that way is much easier. - Can I stop running? - Of course you can. If you don't want to run, you don't have to run. You don't have to put up with it. From now on, you can live with me here. I can? Really? Yes. You can do what you wanted to do the most. What did you really want to do? Seriously. Where did Kanna go? I'm worried she'll be targeted by somebody. I didn't sense any other gods nearby. You must have missed something. No! I learned about all the gods, except maybe some new gods that never existed before. Ever since Tokyo, Kanna's been looking over her shoulder. She said she felt like we were being watched. What if that wasn't her imagination? Kanna's in danger! Hurry! SCHOOL MARATHON Kanna! You can do it! Mom, I did it! Congratulations, Kanna. Now you're sure to get better. Yes. I can draw strength from you too. Your hard work has made the gourd even heavier. Here? Kanna! Kanna! Kanna! Open your eyes! Who are you people? Oh, no. She's lost her memory. Kanna, don't let what they say confuse you. Mom! Remember! You have an important task to carry out! Is this where you should be? Yeah! Remember the gods that have entrusted their valuable chiso to you. Ebisu and Dragon God and Cow God too! Silence! This is Kanna's world. This is the real world that Kanna wished for. It is not a place that you can set foot in! Don't interfere. I'm finally with my mom again. I'm going to stay with my mom forever. No. The Yayoi I know would never do anything to hinder her daughter! Also she would never, ever act in a way that would hurt you! Kanna, you should be able to tell that she is a fake! Yes. Kanna, are you okay? I know! That is a god impostor! - A god impostor? - Yes. Something that was born in present times and wanted to become a god. Gods are born from the relationship between humans and nature and actions between people. But now those things have worn thin, and now we exclude and envy others. Lethargy, unawareness, indifference and ruthless feelings attract it. It is trying to become a new, modern god of calamity. A faithless thing like that isn't a god. It doesn't even exist. You could say it is simply nothing. What on earth was it trying to do? It must have followed Kanna on her journey and was going to steal the gourd once we gathered the chiso. I see. It thought it could become a real god if it ingested it? Yes. It wouldn't be out of the ordinary for such power to reside inside chiso given by the gods. Steal it, then ingest it. What a pathetic plan. Either way, I'm glad we defeated it. No, it won't disappear. Look. I think that as long as humans have the same feelings, that thing will be reborn. It enters into the empty spaces that all people have in their hearts and in due course drags them down. In the end, it's up to the humans. Anyhow, we do not have any time to waste. The gourd is safe. Let's get out of here, Kanna. What's the matter, Kanna? Where's Mom? Where is my mom then? Shiro. Yasha. Tell me the truth. I knew it. I can't see her. I quit! I don't care about Izumo! Kanna. How do you think the gods who trusted you with their chiso will feel? I don't care. It has nothing to do with me. That's right. Yasha, you should carry out the task! You wanted to, right? Kamiari month? Kanna month? Matchmaking gatherings and all that. What does it matter? What is fate anyway? It doesn't make sense! Fate is irrelevant. It's not important at all. I've lived a normal life without problems without it. Everybody's living normal lives... going to school, studying, playing with friends, going home and watching TV, eating dinner. That's fine. Why do I have to have such a hard time? Why do I have to run for gods I didn't even know existed, who have never even helped me? - Why do I have to do... - Shut up! What's wrong with you? Stop griping! Don't you like running? That's why you've been running this whole time! You're the same as Yayoi. Don't you love running through nature? Don't tell me who I am! Stop talking to me like you understand! Please, just leave me alone. Meeting you, Shiro, and traveling with you, Yasha... it was all meaningless. Thank you for saving me. But even if it was fake, I wanted to be there. If I can't see my mom, I'd rather stay there forever. Running means nothing to me anymore. - Kanna! - Hey! What are you doing? USHIJIMA SHRINE And now more typhoon news. Out-of-season Typhoon 22 that is traveling over the sea... I see. Not over there? - ...is likely to touch down on land... - Yes, thank you very much. We are on the scene. The rain is getting stronger. Kanna, where did you go? I'm sorry. I'm not fit to be a father. Kanna! Come on, Kanna! Hey! - Kanna! - It's a waste. Let's go. But... It can't be helped. She's a human. She pushed herself... Rather, she has been pushed too far by us. Let's go. The power of the Idaten isn't working anymore. Hurry. You're injured. There's no way you can run like that. Be quiet! Stop yammering at me. Saving one child over the destiny of the clan despite being a demon. My ancestors were gods long ago. I wonder if it's seven o'clock. The festival's going to begin. Not like I care. That hurts. Kanna. Mom. Are you okay? I'm fine. Do you want to stop? I am fine! Sorry. Then... can you still run? Yeah. The race isn't over yet. And I wasn't even trying that hard. You really hate losing. I don't know who you take after. All right! Let's go! On your marks! Get set... Kanna, come on! Uh-oh, you're gonna get left behind. Hey, tagger, this way Follow the clapping hands Come on! Look who's smiling now! That's because I... I love running. Cherish that feeling. Okay! What? A sun shower? Looks just like you do when you're laughing while crying. That's right. That's who I'm supposed to be. The race isn't over yet. I haven't seriously tried hard either. I have to go. If I carry on like this, I'll develop a dislike for it. I want to believe in what I love! Hey, Shiro. Isn't this Inasa Beach? Yes, but it looks like the ritual is over. Damn it. We came all this way. If we deliver it directly to the Izumo Taisha shrine, we can still... Yasha! There's so much blood. It's just a scratch. Hey! I'll do it! - Kanna! - Kanna! Shiro. Yasha. Can you hear my voice? - Yes! Kanna, can you... - No, she can't see us. But why? I don't know, but I heard your bell ringing. You tied it back together! But I can't see the two of you. It doesn't look like there's any power left to change the flow of time. Kanna? I honestly don't understand much about the task of the Idaten or the festival. I can't comprehend the gods or matchmakers either. But I want to run! I want to run all the way to the end. So leave it up to me once again! Damn it! I lost again! It shouldn't be such a letdown for you. It's the same every year. Shut up. Oh, yes, Yasha. I had a daughter. An Idaten like you has a daughter? Yes. I have a daughter. And I gave her a name. Even though I'm a descendant of Idaten, I'm also a human woman. - I can't do it anymore! Shut up! - That girl carries my blood. Nice to meet you. I'm your daddy. She grabbed my finger! Kanna. I want her to grow up able to create her destiny with her own power and not because she does or doesn't have the power of the gods. Kanna! That's amazing! Daddy! It's amazing! Kanna did it! You're overdoing it. Then what? Then I gave her a name. "Kanna." I see. I see now, Yayoi. It might not be so bad to entrust it to a human child. Hey! There's no more time, Kanna! Okay, I'm going now! - Go, Kanna! - Run! We're counting on you now! Hang on. You can't stand there. - You can't come through this way. - It can't be. Wait! Hey, you! IZUMO TAISHA SHRINE Hello? I've brought it! It's the feast for the gods. Hello? I'm sorry. I didn't make it in time! Kanna! You made it! Still a blockhead though. Shiro. Yasha too. Is this allowed? Okuninushi has given us special permission. That's great! That's really great! I'm not in the right place here. I'm not comfortable! The truth is that you like it though. Now, Kanna, bring the chiso here. Let the Kamiari feast begin! IZUMO TAISHA SHRINE Idaten. No. Kanna. Thank you for running such a long way. Please rest from your fatigue to your heart's content here. Thank you. But I will go home. My dad must be worried. Okuninushi! I understand that what I'm about to ask is improper. - Shiro? - What's he doing? Please. Somehow, with your matchmaking powers could you allow Kanna and her mother, Yayoi, to meet? I truly understand how selfish of a request it is. I also know that our world is different from that other world. But Kanna has carried out the mission despite being so young! I don't care what punishment I have to face. Please, somehow. As the exception of exceptions. Fate is like that knot that connects origins to results. We do not create fates. We connect them. Humans create the causes and effects. Each and every human takes actions, making the cause. And then they usher in the effect. Shiro, it's okay. I feel like I did get to see her. This journey was a chance to properly get to know my mom. And also myself as well. And also? And also, of course, the two of you! That hurts! - Yasha, are you crying? - He's crying. No, I'm not! I'm going out. GOOD MORNING! GOING FOR A RUN. BREAKFAST IS IMPORTANT! - KANNA All right, let's go. Honestly. Bad form as always. And yet you lost to her. What was that? I never lost! The race hasn't started yet. Yeah. Subtitle translation by: Noelle Marie Hollister
