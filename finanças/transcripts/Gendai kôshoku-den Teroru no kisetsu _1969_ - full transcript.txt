He was the principal suspect in the embassy arsony. He remained free for lack of evidence. After the affair, he disappeared. He has hidden himself away in that fiat. - Excuse me. - Thank you! Your work is really hard. Sorry. I overheard your conversation. Is he such a dreadful person? In the housing estates, there aren't any relationships between the residents. I don't know what sort of people live around here. Never reveal anything about us, please! I understand that very well. If he were to find out, it would be terrible! - Please. - Thank you.

I'll eat it. - Take off your coat at least! - Wash your hands! - All right. Delicious? Meat is so expensive these days. How about replacing it with our buttocks? - You cook curry and rice with them? - Curry and rice? - What are you saying?- - Curry and rice. Oh! No! - I want a baby. - Me too, Let's give birth at the same time. - We have to buy clothes for the winter. - How much will your bonus be? Maybe 7 or 8 months worth, I wonder if mine will be as much as yours? We have to buy a sweater or a coat, for our sleepy cat. By the way, the chief of our company has got divorced. They married because they were in love, He looks very lonely these days. { like a man like that. In that case, he would probably have made love very poorly. "A female student waiting in a hotel. Prostitution: you can enjoy fresh skin, "Women entertain more than men recently. That's why in Osaka, 'taxi prostitutions' "are increasing and young whores earn a lot. "How about a group of prostitutes who are all female students? "Try to play with them at least once!" No! I'm afraid the ear pick might go into your ear too deeply. Stop, please! Not Stop it - Chieko isn't her sister. -No. - What's the situation? - I wonder. No! Wait a moment! No! The defectives are in the next room. What's happening? Surrounded by walls, it's the only fun he can have. They're making fools of us. - Where are you going? - The toilet. I want to piss. Ah, Excuse me, I'm satisfied] It's really him? The man arrested recently confirmed it. There's no mistake. That man who was nearly beaten to death? Yes. Tonight nothing seems to be happening. Let's sleep. Good morning! Wake up! It's time for breakfast. No! Quickly! - Good morning. - Good morning. - Newspapers. - All right. -Hey! - What? - Railway fares are being raised again. - Really? Disgusting! 1 buy a season ticket for six months. From here to Shinjuku, it costs 760 yen a month, 1200 yen from Shinjuku to Marunouchi. They're going to increase more? -Hey! I've finished. It's cold, From next time on, you pay the fare when I go to the toilet. Why? - Shit. - Shit? Fare for seat... « Unpleasant! - Unpleasant! Isn't it time for you both to go? - All right. - There's no sign of him moving? -No. Don't things on the housing estates ever change? Look around! if enclosed in such a place... It's normal? I won't be able to bear this for long. Excuse me. Your work is really hard. Here are some newspapers. Don't hesitate if you need something! That is the duty of a citizen. Don't bother, Madam! It's nothing! Attending to you like this is the duty of the nation! If we need something, we'll call you. In that case, I'll leave. She's meddlesome! Every night, she has nothing else to do but make love, 80 she wants to interfere in everything. In her dreams, she's received the reward from the Commissioner and become famous. My sleepy cat! Your lunch is in the pot on the electric oven. Be docile until we get back. All right? Al right - Chie, hurry! - OK. - We're going to be late. Hurry! - Wait a moment! We only have ten minutes left. - See you. - See you. They're leaving. Man dies for certain. Try imagining that you're dead! { want to cry while being pulled by a dog. Damn it! { want to go to a nearby bar. Happy or happy again? Nothing beyond the bar. He's mocking himself. A failure is always like this. He's pitiful, though a failed reactionary activist. He'll do something before long, as if it was completely normal, I cannot understand that, We'll exchange your wastepaper with toilet paper. I'm getting impatient. Almost anyone will confess if they get beaten five or six times, I doubt it. This kind of man can be intractable. What does my neighbour do in the fate autumn? In the late autumn, your neighbour smokes. What on earth is attractive in such a thin man? He's easy, that stallion! In fact, my sterility may be due to my fear of the visitor whom my life depends on? The commissioner general, at the inspection of each team, said that he'd give rewards to the successful ones. I'd like to outsmart the other teams. I want to arrest him and make him confess, regardless of whether he's guilty or not. Don't be in such a rush! - He's simply going for a walk? - He might exchange some information. -Damn it! I's harassment! - He's guarded. - He may have nothing to do with this. -We don't have to conclude hurriedly. What on earth is he doing? I don't understand. I don't either. A failure cannot help but act so. Compassion is useless! We cannot succeed in life with such defeatism. We'd better torture that man who confessed once again? Wait a bit! Excuse me. Have some noodles, if you like! Thank you. We're back, our sleepy cat. You're a bad boy! Day after day, today as well as yesterday, waking up, eating, then sleeping, then eating and making love, what is he doing everyday? Does he have anything worth living for, like us? I wonder... 1 no longer know what we're watching. That's worth living for? It seems foolish to me. Always... - I'm going to Albania, without any aim. - Albania? That far? I you're lost in the forest? He'll never be lost, for he can make maps. - Maps? - His maps are so precise. Chie is late. She's got a boyfriend, perhaps? - That's better. - Of course, for I can only be with you. No. We're doing fine with the three of us, Why speak of just us two'? That would mean a restraint to you? I don't like sex between just two people. Why? I's too normal, and not at all interesting. Marriage is meaningless, unless one can do 'that' for free. - You think so? - We mustn't think of betrayal! I wonder if that's really the way it is? What's wrong, Chie? - I was nearly raped. -Raped, really? - Are you all right? - He beat me about the head many times. -What did he do? - The man pushed me over and - squeezed my breasts. - Like this? Then he bit my thighs and tried to pull down my panties. No! Stop! My sleepy cat! Rape me too! Once you've been raped, you won't be afraid any more. Hey! - I'm off. - See you! Damn! They flirt day after day! This must be bogus information. Don't be so emotional! But after more than four days, we haven't learnt anything. He does as he likes and, moreover, he flirts! A man with such rotten balls can really be an important person? I want to run up there at once and beat him to death! But we can't do so. Yes, I am. I'm an insignificant person. I'll be happy if you overlook me. What? Development of SST also in Japan, in 1972, What is this restlessness after women have left? Nothing is better than to sleep. Doesn't he have anything else to do? I've also become restless. - He's too lonely. - And in the next room, too... Don't complain! This is also our work. Nothing seems to be happening today, either. No. Who is it? - Hi! Imai. - I haven't seen you for ages. Come in! - You live in a nice fat. - Yes. Sit down! - OK. - Do you want some alcohol? - Good! How did you find me here? In fact, when Saito was arrested, I happened to hear of you. A reactionary activist. Is that his associate? - We can get some evidence at last! -Yes, It'll be hard, as it's winter. H's very cold there. We're back now. - Good evening. Hello! - A guest? You're welcome. Go and buy some snacks! - All right. Which is yours? - Which? Both. - Both? Then you do everything together? - That too? - Of course. You're doing well! You've hidden yourself in a fine place! Drink! They don't fight each other over you? This is the best place to hide oneself in. The police will never find it. - Are you still an activist? -Of course! -So. - I'm glad to see you. - When do you go back? - Where? -To the front! - I'm never going back there. -What? - I've deserted. - You're joking? - It's true. I'll never return. Hey! Are you betraying your comrades? Have you lost that tough passion of yours? To hide yourself in this way, in the midst of the armed enemy, is your response to your fellows fighting, at the cost of their lives? That's nothing to do with me any more. The armed combat you'd passionately insisted on, and we'd adopted, wasn't a solution that we'd attained in under- standing the complicated and difficult situation caused by the reformation and re-establishment of imperialism? Armed combat? Stop dreaming! Those who can't distinguish themselves from Che Guevara could do something? What? The movement for revolution is nonsense. -You confuse even its meaning. - No, with our backs against the wall we... You're passionate about pointless things. Don't be a hypocrite! Bastard! You've forgotten Bolshevik solidarity! The evolution of armed combat of our troops, organized with all our efforts, in preparation for the final fight in '70, and for people to rebel with resolve... I've deserted! Bastard! What's become of your Marx? Trotsky? Where's your Paris Commune? I've made up my mind not to have any more fantasies. What did that result in? Only exhaustion, tiredness, fantasies and supporting the gendarmerie!! I'm fed up with confused fights, which escalate without any hope of victory. Bastard! It's the fallout of justice! You're aiming at the realization of Utopia? No. Rather, it's the future itself which is exerting pressure on us heavily. 1 much prefer living with women. You've betrayed us completely. You've been degenerated by those women. Say what you like! Return now! What? I'll beat you! I'll have nothing to do with you any more! You retreat? You flee when faced with the enemy? You're the worst! 1 become ashamed, to think you were a fellow I bled with! Degenerate bastard! Rotten balls! - He really has deserted. - It looks like it. We'll report to headquarters tomorrow. Here we are. Where is your guest? He's gone back. Let's drink. I have a headache, I'm not going to work today. Miyoko, telephone the company. I also drank too much; I have a headache, You're not going to work? I'm not going. Without permission? I don't care. I'll say, “I'm having my period. " - Breakfast? - Sorry. Wait a little longer! Al right. I'll sleep for days, till it's ready. - It's very likely to be false information. - Yes. My sleepy cat, you'd better go to the cinema today. All right. Yes. For almost a week, there's been no sign he would make a move. Yes. All right. Goodbye. What do they say? They say to keep watching until the day he leaves for the U.S.A. It's strange. They do between three what people normally do between two, though they look like ordinary people. They aren't as dangerous as those who carry bombs to kill. It was worth marking him so as we could determine whether he was suspect or not, - Our sleepy cat is late. - Something has happened to him? - Hi! - Hit -You're late. - Supper is ready? - What did you watch today? - A pink film: "At the Risk of Life". -Was it interesting? -Yes, There was a funny episode in it. The elder sister was twenty, and the younger sight. When they tried to get over a fence one meter high, the elder could, but not the younger. Why? -Why? - Tell me the reason! I'll tell you: the younger hadn't yet had a menses. Menses? It's normal! Menses... Fence. Menses... Fence? Ah! I made that out. No! - Beer! - All right. Good! Good night. Good night. Wake up! If's time. I'm sleepy. - Newspapers? - Here. The Prime Minister leaves for the U.S.A. tomorrow. Conclusion to negotiations for Okinawa's return. Today, in 176 places across the country, extremists plan to attack Haneda. -Hey! I've finished. - All right. What's for breakfast? Toast and carrot juice, plus fresh garlic. - My sleepy cat, I want a baby. - Me too, - I don't want one. -Why? Anyway, I don't want one! Prime Minister Sato leaves for the U.S.A. this morning. Guerillas mainly around Kamata There's no sign he's going to start moving. He may be sleeping. - How about going back to headquarters? - All right. I want to go home and relax. I've been really annoyed by this man on the blacklist, Yes. This time we've really been put out, The End Translated by quaisnord for ADC Revised by Lord Retsudo for ADC
