Look what I’ve got for you You want more? Do you have a light? I'm afraid you'll have to do it this way, Sir You seem like a dog whisperer How come? I saw you playing with that dog over there My youngest would also find dogs, cats, all sorts of animals and would spend the whole day playing with them I haven’t seen you here before This is my first time here And you, Sir? Who do you have here... I mean... who is missing... Don't worry, I know what you mean My two sons My brother and his sons Six people - How are you, Uncle Musa? - So so - Have some tea - No, I'm alright - It's nice and hot - No I can't How are you? Alright Are you cold? A little, I guess Uncle Musa, Bekim is my fiancé Congratulations Thank you May you be blessed with kids Best wishes Thank you Hell of a man Listen to me now Once you are married, fill your house with kids You can never have too many Don’t be like today's youth, worrying if you can afford it or not When it comes to kids Make as many as you can Do you know if they’re near? They said they should be here in an hour I heard they’re bringing one hundred today No, no, 92 Come now, everybody. They’ve arrived Make some room. Move aside Move your cars You, move! This way. Move on Come Move to the side Make way for the truck Look at me Get out of the tent. You shouldn't be in the tent How many are you missing? My fiancée's parents are missing Sorry, why were there so many children's bones? What? Weren’t they children? No, this is how they bring them They're never complete Sometimes it's just an arm or just a leg Sometimes it's the skull What, the family ends up burying only half the bones? What can you do? Hopefully your fiancée finds her own Hopefully Any news from them? No When are they supposed to let you know? Well, if they don't inform me within a couple of months It means they haven't found them this time either Let's see I really envy my sister being abroad Why? She only cares about her own ass While I deal with everything on my own She looks after her kids, her husband - that's it After these gatherings, I'm completely useless I'm totally drained I can't concentrate on work or anything else I don't want to pass this feeling onto you I want to look forward from now on We'll get married and have kids I don't want my kids to grow feeling they're waiting for someone they have never met and will never see My sweetheart - Have a look! - Uh-uh - It’s Arben - What's he saying? He has sent some kitchen designs Any good? Not bad I mean... I don't know Give it here! You drive! Give it to me Easy! Where do you think you’re going? - Don’t get mad - That brat He's saying the first models can be done at once It's a month's wait for the others - Let me see! - They look OK We'll see them at the bar. Drive now! - Hey - Long time no see When have you arrived? How are you? - Wow, what a surprise! - How are things? - Didn’t expect to see me, huh? - Not at all You're looking great. How are you? You’re not introducing me to your friend? We'll introduce ourselves. Hi, I'm Anita - I'm Nol. Pleased to meet you - Likewise Come on, let’s have a beer I don't think we can, we wanted to... Are you kidding me? We haven’t seen each other for two years It’s OK with me OK then What do you want to do? You want to go or... Should I go? No, I just thought you wanted to leave - I'll leave, no problem - No, no, have a seat Bekim, come Alright? You've done a great job with the place We had a makeover. It got a bit dull What are you drinking? - Beer - Oh no, no Dren, change it. Bring three house beers You’ve finally brewed your own? - Yeah - No kidding? Well done. You did it, at last - Is it any good? - You'll see now Dren, bring us some mezze - What brings you back? - Some things to take care of - When did you arrive? - A couple of days ago Your passport must have expired Something personal OK Not that I want to hide anything, it's just not the right moment It’s cool Don't tell us you came looking for a wife or your inheritance Where do you live? In France Oh great - For how long now? - A couple of years Great, what do you do there... except drink wine? I eat cheese Seriously, what do you do there? - Music - Really? I recognize you now I read a lot about you Why didn’t you tell me you know him? I don’t know, it never came up We were war buddies But Bekim didn't fight True, but we were in hiding together He was the landlady’s son, I was the student lodger He still is the landlady’s son Ah, the eternal Sadie. Does she still wrap you in cotton wool? Mm, the beer Stop it now, you’re embarrassing me - Don't worry, it's cute - Stop it You’re sweet - Do you want to hear a story? - Yes, yes Enough already, Nol! - You don’t want me to go on? - No OK then, let's go No man, I haven't touched it in two years Two years! All the more reason to play - Nah, not this one - Yes, yes Wait That’s it Anita! Anita! Don’t come in Open the door! Hold on a minute, Mom Open the door - Why did you come in? - What were you doing? Why did you leave work so early? What's this smell? You touched my perfume. You know I hate it when you touch my stuff - Aw, great stuff! - Good or bad, they're mine Your dress and perfume are more important than me - Why are you shouting? - If you caught Arjeta wearing it... you'd probably let her have it - Do you want the dress? - No... it's stupid This is my wedding dress. It means a lot to me I'd rather you didn't damage it Are you planning to wear it again? It won't fit you anyway Shut up and take it off I can’t, it's tangled Careful, it might snap. Wait... let me do it for you Careful with the button - Let me remove your lipstick - I'll remove it myself I was just about to call you Sorry, I got held up at work - How are you? - Fine and you? I’ll take it in a bit here Look, Zana Have a look in the mirror I want a really tight fit I’ll do a tight fit, don’t worry. Any way you want it Otherwise, it looks gorgeous. I love it so much - You’ve done a great job - A genuine vintage look Exactly how I wanted it. Not too flashy… And it looks really great on you - Really? - Cross my heart Listen, I’ve got an idea for the collar Why don't we add some crystals? - On the collar? - Yes, it will look beautiful I don't know, I love the way it looks now It's plain... so nice It looks good on you and you like it but this will make it look trendier I don’t know, Zana. I'm afraid it might look too busy You know I prefer it plain? - I know you do - But, I prefer to leave it like this You know what? I will add the crystals... and when you come for dinner on Saturday you try the dress first and then decide What dinner on Saturday? - Didn't Bekim tell you? - No, he didn't mention it Typical! Do you know of my aunt who lives in the States? Yeah She wants to meet you and congratulate you on your marriage since she can’t come to the wedding She wants to congratulate me before the wedding? But you’ve set the date and it’s not a big deal if she congratulates you two weeks in advance - You know what? - Tell me Keep an option... to remove the stones, as I will probably go without them Just be careful not to leave any marks Of course not. This fabric is very sensitive Very well then What about the kitchen? Have you decided already? No, we didn't order it yet You’re moving into a new apartment It might take you years before you settle in completely We were about to choose a design the other day But we ran into Nol and didn't get a chance to decide Which Nol? Nol, the musician who used to rent a room at your house - When did he return? - A few days ago, he said - How long is he staying? - I don’t know, I didn't ask When Bekim hangs out with Nol He drinks and gets in all sorts of trouble Why the hell did he return? It's not a big deal if they had a boozy night We get drunk sometimes, too. Nothing bad happens to us We have a blast Hey, what's up guys? Not much - Bekim - Huh? Where's your phone? Don't know. Why? I called you so many times, you're not answering Ah, I forgot it's on silent. Was it urgent? No, it's just that we didn't decide on the kitchen design yet - The guy was expecting us - Ah shit, the kitchen! Nol, how are you? Fine Did something happen? Why? Something must have happened Nothing happened If you don't want to say that's another matter but it feels as if somebody just died Bekim, please! Say something, this is freaking me out! I'll tell you later Not later - tell her now! Why later? What? Tell her now! He broke up with his girlfriend I didn't break up with my girlfriend I broke up with the love of my life. It's not the same thing Why did you break up? - Or maybe it's not the right moment to ask - It's not... Remember Romeo and Juliette? Impossible love Why, is Juliette a Serb? What is it? I'm not feeling well - Look at me! What's wrong? - Fuck Bring me a glass of water! What's happening with you? Don't touch me! Hurry up, Liki! Sorry Nol Sit up and down it! - No, he shouldn't! - Stay away Sit up and down it. You'll feel better in no time I don't know the details of your break up and I don't want to know It's actually not important at all What matters is that you love each other Fight for her, man! Since you say it's true love Go after her No one can resist love You will see that she will leave everything and come after you I guarantee it What if the feeling is not mutual? How can you tell without trying? When it comes to love You must drop everything else To love To love I'm glad you're saying this It's such a fucked up situation You have no idea But I agree I must fight for it till the end Of course Huh Bekim, what do you think? Ah no, I don't know "I don't know" is not an answer Yes, Nol, yes. Fight for it Fight till the very end Romeo must know that I cannot live alone Romeo I must tell you a joke, too Go on I don't know if I can tell it right It's a bit stupid. Don't mind me Don't worry, we will laugh anyway Let me catch my breath See, it's already funny A husband and wife were doing it And the husband was really into it "Oh honey, oh baby, oh sweetheart..." "Turn around, I want to take you from behind" Just as he's about to take her from behind, she says: "As if you nailed it from the front and now you want the behind, too" It reminds you of Bekim, huh? No No, not really Oh dear God We'd better go, before I nail it myself Come on then, let's go - Where are you going? - We're leaving - Stay a bit longer - No, it's enough Let's have another drink No, let's go. If I could get up Sit down. She needs a few more drinks Let's go. Stand up Let me finish my drink. Where do you want to go? You care only about yourself But it was your idea to leave It was not my idea. Get up and get us another round I cannot get up How were you planning to go home then? Get us another round, don't be a dickhead Why? Why "why"? Why do you insist on going home? Please - I beg you - Get off! I will do anything you want Bekim, stop the car, please Bekim! She's about to throw up Stop the car! I can't. Let me find a spot first She found a spot Are you alright? I feel much better Fuck, if I could feel better, too Stick your fingers in and vomit Yeah great, turn my car into a vomitorium I meant, once he gets home There's a lump in my stomach, it's killing me It will be alright, Nol. Don't worry If it's true love, you will get back together But in case it's not, fuck it You'll find someone, who appreciates you And who will fight for you, against the entire world, if necessary Will you shut up already! Alright! I hear you shushing right here What's got into you? Say what you have to say I have nothing to say I feel you staring, analyzing me the whole time Can you tell me what's got into you? Staring, staring, staring What am I supposed to do, according to you? You must leave me alone and not stare at me non-stop Look at her, still staring Stop the car! Why? Pull over at once! No, I won't - I want to get out - I will take you home I will go by myself. Pull over! No, I won't Don't touch me Let me go Let me drive you home Go away, I'll walk by myself It's too far I know how far it is - I said go away - Wait, listen Leave me, I want to go by myself You can't even stand straight Let me drive you Don't touch me! I got out of the car to get away from you - You can't get away - Watch me! I'll follow behind to make sure you get home safe And then you don't have to see me ever again What are you doing? Huh? Are you doing this to spite me? You're free to go You're fucking with my mind But you're not to blame. This is all my fault Why should I care if you stay here or not Do whatever the hell you want Don’t you worry sweetheart. One door shuts, another three open Cheers now, to my three future boyfriends Right... not bad at all Doesn't the saying go: "one shuts, another one opens"? Three open, sweetie: door one, the boy is very handsome But he’s full of himself, selfish and won’t satisfy you But anyway you’ve gone out with him just to spite your ex So the result is - zero - And then? - Then comes the second one The second one is... nice He’s uglier than the first, but he's a wizard in bed Oh how I miss it... You mean Sokol, right? I completely forgot about Sokol, wherever he is I'm not talking about me, I mean in general Not Sokol, but Krenar Oh, excuse me! I want to go straight to the second one You cannot do that without going through with the first The second one won’t call you, even if you're dying to go out with him... Ooh, the motherfucker! And after that, separation grief hits you You don't know if you’re crying over the ex, or the first, or the second... ...or all of them together, or some uncle. Is anyone you know sick? I know this story all too well - Me too - Me too I know, my sweetie By the way, there’s a guy over there checking you out big time Someone is watching me?

Yes and he keeps looking at you Pretend we're talking Be discreet... oh God - Nah - What, is he ugly? He’s not my type - Whoa! - What happened? My God! Look over at the bar Not that fast. Turn slowly, like this... Hey, he’s coming, he’s coming You have a future together... he’s jug-eared! He's not. Why are you saying that? All your exes were jug-eared Bite me... eat shit You’ve got a future with him. I can see you together It's the story of your life... Jug Ears Name one - Dardan had jug ears - OK, Dardan Carlos I don't care, he was fit What about Mili, Mommy's boy? Mili was Mr. Jug Ears - Excuse me, ladies - Yes? These are on the house Thanks to "the house" Who is "the house" in this case? - The House is that guy - The one with the green eyes? That’s him The jug-eared one? That's how we call him, too Can you tell me... Which one is Pea? Which one is Nut? - I don't know - Guess Can I eenie, meenie, miny, moe it? Yes, you can Can you hear me? Eenie, meenie? OK, you can Eenie, meenie... This one is Pea... this one is Nut Don’t eat my Pea Can we arm-wrestle? Arm-wrestle now? Sure, why not Just let me get these out of the way So we don’t get hurt But take it easy. I have to win Don’t humiliate me in front of all these people - Oh God - Don’t go too hard! No, really, I’m not joking I have a lot of self-confidence Bravo I thought you’d pull out The bathroom is over there Nol Hey, Nol! Hey What brings you here? How are you doing? Yeah, just going out for a bit What’s happening? Nothing. Work. Home. That’s all How's the wedding planning coming along? A little slower the last few days Really? And Bekim? How is he doing? Haven’t you seen him? No, not since the night we got drunk Why do you ask? No, no reason... What about you? What’s going on with your girlfriend? Oh never mind – it’s stupid I get drunk and talk nonsense and always regret it the next day Please forget about it Of course At least you get drunk to fix things. Better than Bekim and me What do you mean? We get drunk to mess things up Why, did Bekim fuck up? We both fucked up Why, what happened? If you don't mind telling me I don’t know What happened, Anita? - I don't know - Where is Bekim? I don’t know It's stupid. We had an argument I don’t know how or why He left me out on the road like some piece of shit He didn't even call to apologize or nothing... Well I haven’t seen him since that night - No? - Nope I thought you might know something Go to the bar and see How can I? I don’t know what’s wrong with him To tell you the truth, Anita... I am the last person to advise you on this If I were any good at this, I would sort out my own stuff I know Look... I got to go. I have some friends waiting for me I have to... I’m late as it is Go, sorry to keep you Sorry... bye Bekim - Two guys want to talk to you - About what? They just said they want to talk to you Here's the stock list. Everything's in order The total is at the bottom Only the kitchen fridge is on the other page OK, great Can you talk to those two guys? Yeah, right away - Bekim! - Yes, what? Those guys are throwing a party and want to book our place But they want to talk directly to you Why the hell me? Did you tell them you’re the manager? I told them, man, but they insist. What can I do? What am I paying you for... if I have to do everything myself? - We will be somewhere around... - 80 people And we wanted to know the price - For when? - For tonight Tonight tonight? We had a booking at "X", but they called just now and apparently they had a double-booking, so they cancelled Tonight is difficult Can’t you do anything for tonight? - What time? - Around 6 or 7 Whenever it suits you We can sort something out Talk to the manager and arrange it with him Thank you...sorry, one more... Yes? - Sorry - Tell me Can we possibly have it with doors locked? It's very important to us! - A lock up? - Yes It would be expensive on a Saturday Money is no object. We don’t want our party to fail The thing is... This is a very special event What’s the story? Well, our organization deals with human rights... It’s for the LGBT community Ah no, it won’t happen Not here Talk to me Mom It’s not a big deal if Aunt Remzije doesn’t see the bride today I’m busy. Should I worry about your lunches and dinners now? Fine... I’ll call you later. I’m very busy No need - There’s a duvet instead then - No need Have you ever done homework under the duvet? Bekim I understand you very well, but you have to understand me too OK then It’s not as simple as you say: What's done is done and it's all in the past... now let’s live happily ever after I was drunk, I'm a bad drunk and sometimes I lose it So now every time you get drunk I must forgive you because you were drunk? - No, no - But what? OK, listen I promise I will never get so drunk and lose myself like that Mark my words. Never! OK Couldn't you call once at least to say sorry? You left me waiting for 4 days like some piece of shit - How do you explain that? - I have no explanation The explanation is... stupid Tell me, even if it's stupid Go on, tell me I was too proud to call you - Proud? - I was too proud - Too proud to call me? - What can I say Wow And now? - Now... - What? When you sent me the pregnancy test... it completely changed my perspective so pride and grudge made no sense anymore I got the photo from the internet You did what? I downloaded it and sent it to you What... Why, for what reason? I just wanted to know If your grudge was real That’s all So, what's your conclusion? That it wasn’t that real What now? Are you insane? Are you feeling OK? But I really am late Don’t fuck with me! Are you fucking with me? What do you mean you're late?

We'll go now OK Zana doesn't seem to like Nol When did you two get to talk about Nol? It came up... I told her he had returned and she went completely pale She said, "Nol makes Bekim drink... makes him do silly things... I don’t like him" She was trembling as she spoke. She was so upset Fair enough, she doesn’t like him. It's a sore point Bekim Don’t tell me... there's something between Nol and Zana Don’t let anyone hear you say that Wow But did I guess right? You musn't talk about it Of course not... Are you keeping it secret from me? - You musn’t say anything, ever! - Don't worry Promise you’ll never tell anyone! But I guessed it, right?

Will you have mine, too She is so well mannered and so graceful She speaks to you so kindly I love her like my own daughter But she's been through so much When she talks about her parents, you'd think they're still alive It’s so sad And our kids have us right here, but don’t appreciate us Yeah, right And those with no parents think we are having a ball You devil They've brought some corpses from Serbia recently And I fear they will find them this time At the most inconvenient moment... Ah no. I told them to inform her a month after the wedding Well done What have you done? Well... not to ruin the wedding What have you done? Take it easy, don't shout Why do you interfere? Are you crazy? Calm down first They didn't find them in 15 years... I called them just in case Are you insane? Don’t get upset. Take it easy This is how it works Fine, I’ll make sure they inform her When you calm down you’ll understand They are dead anyway. It makes no difference And if you asked her I don't think she would say: "bring them right now" Are you two mind-reading experts or what? When you're older you think differently... Come! - How did the dress fit? - Very well It turned out extremely nice Zana? She’s putting the kids to sleep - You? - Nothing Where's that box gone?

Everyone? The children, too Damned if you do, damned if you don't Exactly, what do you do? It's tough If you go to the police and register, they will know where you live They have you listed and can come and execute you If you don’t go and they catch you without papers - That's even worse - And me with my broken leg It's like suicide How to explain I haven’t been fighting I'm not from round here, she's pregnant Tomorrow, we’re going out You have decided, huh? Don’t worry about us Whatever we have left we can share May God provide for you But it's up to you It’s better if we left. You have the kids to worry about I hear you but somehow... I really don’t know what to say It’s better if we leave Come, help yourselves Mom, where did you find cheese? - I went out and bought it - Really? - Didn’t you see me go out? - No Of course not, how would you? They could come and slaughter us before you realized it All day on your computer You play cards, we play computer games, same thing Leave the kids alone At least they have that I'm glad they have a distraction But how can they sing and laugh in times like these - What can they do? - Be a little afraid And take to the hills? Shut it for God’s sake Mom, you’re driving us crazy I'll have some more cheese Lights out, lights out! They must've hit them on the road to Mitrovica Yeah, when they hit the Police HQ, I thought the entire house would crumble Indeed Be quiet for a second Close those curtains See anything? It’s far - you were right, Uncle Nevzat - What? - It's farther away, he says Yes, it’s farther away. The Post Office is still standing I hope they flatten them They'll only flatten the buildings. They can’t kill anyone with air raids The army and police are hiding in people's homes It’s useless, the war won't end without the infantry Either that or The Apaches - Why don't they send in Apaches? - I don't know - How long do they think we can last? - Shut up for God's sake Please, close those curtains Really, close the curtains! You know what would really be delightful right now? I know Besides that Besides that? I don’t know... Cigarettes? Wow We’re missing so many things I meant chocolate Chocolate? Craving it badly, huh? Yeah No man, what chocolate! I don't need anything at all I’m doing great I’m loving it so much Unbelievable There's a war, you know? Fuck, people are dying all over. I feel so guilty sometimes I’ve never been so complete If the Serbs weren't killing us I would always want to live like this Our people would kill us, too, for that matter - Our own? - Yes Why our people? War or not, my mother would execute us first Yep You're right It seems... the only thing that could unite Serbs and Albanians is that: eradicate us They can all suck our dicks No, no - not now - Come on, why not? - Not now, man Everyone is asleep Don’t get paranoid, come on Easy, it still hurts Those motherfuckers A bit lower Hey How are you feeling, boy?
