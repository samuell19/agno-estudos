THE RESTLESS What are you doing?! Dad? I'm swimming back, you take the boat. Go on, you know how. Be careful with your hands. Good job! Are you happy? Yes. - Yes? Were you afraid? - No. No? A little? Damien! All OK? Leïla! Amine! - Come. Shit. Damien? Do you have to do that now? What are you doing? Hey? - What? What's going on? - Let me fix this and I'll come in. It's 2 o’clock, Damien! - Yep. And you can't do it tomorrow? You're not exhausted? - Not at all. Tomorrow you'll be happy to be able to ride it. Yeah... I'm right behind you. Stop that, Amine's asleep! - So...you see? I'll fix the other one too. Here. Where are you going? - Shopping, for Serge. Call him, see if he wants to go sailing? No rush. He's arriving at midday. I'll just get some fish. Ask him about sailing. - Damien, it's 7 am. Hey, Amine. - Hi. Hello! - Hi. You good, Leïla? - Yeah. How are you, Amine? She been asking non-stop: "Where's Amine, Amine, Amine?" All day. - Same here. Good to see you! How are you Damien? - Glad to see you. Me too. - Hi, Léa, good trip? Ready for a swim? - Yes. That's all she's been talking about. Let's get your bathing suit. - One... two... Are you okay, Léa? There's too much gravel that way. I'm going to paint the move. I'll paint the chaos. Create some order. I'm going to do 40 paintings. 40 paintings that we exhibit in Metz. We go and see Berenbaum. Berenbaum's a sure thing, he'll buy straight away. You can call all your clients to announce the next exhibition. "The Move". 40 paintings, 40 days, one exhibition. Damien, stop it. - Stop what? You're being a pain. Look at me. You're a pain. Relax, it's all cool. Just relax, calm down. What's stressing you? Some 'cata' will do you good. Catamaran? - To clear your head. The sea air, you'll see. No catamaran now. Oh really, watch me... Jean-Loup? It's Damien, you good? I have friends here. I thought I'd take them sailing. Can you rent me your boat today? Leave it, Damien. - Stop. Give me a sec. Yeah, two, three hours... - I don't want to go sailing. Good. I'll see with him and call you back. Yeah, thanks. Let's get going. Come on. Stop! I've stopped. You okay, Damien? You've got to try and sleep at night. I have to finish. No, no. Rest a bit - We'll do it. Rest in one of the rooms. It's too hot out here. You rest and we'll take care of everything. Yeah, okay, I'll go take a nap. This one annoys me. Everything's fine. I'm not tired, I feel great. Damien, talk to me. Let's enjoy... I want to finish preparing that lovely meal. No, finish it later. Rest now. - Later? And when do we eat? I'm going. - It's a holiday! Exactly, that's why I'm going to finish. Damien, stop this... - Come on, get off my back. Let us do it. So, you're both ganging up on me? Is that it? I'm fine. Everything's fine. Go onto the terrace. I'll bring you a drink. I'll finish prepping my delicious meal and I promise to sleep after. Shit, no ice cream left. Know what? Keep an eye on this. I'll go get some ice cream at the port. You're in no state to drive. - It'll take 5 minutes. You haven't slept in two days. We can get ice-cream tomorrow. I'll be right back. I'll go after him. Tell Léa I'll be right back. Hello? Yes... So, where are you? Which hospital is he in? OK, I hear you. Yes. Okay, see you in a bit. When's Dad getting here? Soon. He won't be long. psychiatric ward Mrs. Feki? Come in. Kids, kids! Take the groceries inside. And do your homework. Take all this. Hi guys, all good? - Hi. So? - I like it. You OK? You look rested. - Yep, great. It's really good. - That's not finished yet. Let me show you another one. You've settled in nicely. No, stay there. So? - Oh yes. Good, right? - Very good. Here's another one. - Let's see. This one too. Got any more? - Yes. Yes. - Any news on the dates? They're confirmed. - Great. But, Damien, stop selling to your friends. You're screwing us over. Okay, during lockdown, but now... I'll stop. - We have an exhibition to prepare. It's really great. Don’t give up on this series. Yeah? - Yes. They'll sell. Trust me. I'll finish this one, and do two or three more. There has to be a shortage. To create the desire. Look... Let me give you an advance. No. - Oh, yes. Serge, I'm fine, I... - No. Here, take it. But... You stay focused until November, okay? Trust me. The buyers are out there. I don't know, we'll see. - They are. I'm sure of it I'm confident. Want some coffee? No, we have to deliver these to Stettner. Bye. - See you. Later, guys. This fabric is the closest I've found. Here it is. This one. Yeah, it's not bad. Yeah? - Yes. The upholstering won't be easy. I can't do you a discount. 800? 1,200. Or I order it, and you do it yourself. I'll come by this afternoon? - Fine. OK, great. Excellent. - Thanks. Bye. - See you. We're done working with antique dealers. They'll try anything. Crazy. - You didn't give in, well done. Thanks. Right, I'm off. How many pages left? I'm on page 83 of 110. You want us to finish it together? - Yeah. Can you hand me a piece of bread? With raisins or the other? The other. Amine! Come on! Amine? - Coming. No, no, no! - What?! Should I do it? - Move, I'll manage. It's not that hard. The other way. Yes! Stop! Fuck's sake. You call that helping? Here, Dad. - No, keep it. Dad, come on, so we're even. - Pay me back later. Take what you lent me! Just take it! - There's no rush. Stop, just take it. I prefer it this way. Jesus! Unbelievable. Here. What did you do? Oh Damien! It's gorgeous. Where did you find it? I asked Luc to keep an eye out. Are you okay? Yeah, why? - No reason. It's just that... It's expensive, Damien. Yes, but I've been paid. Everything's fine. Are you happy? - Yes, it makes me happy. Does it make you happy? It makes me happy. It looks great on you. It's gorgeous. I have something to show you. Just feel it. What will you...? - Nothing. It should be kept as is, so as not to damage it. Just freshen it up, that's all. I only changed this. They asked me to paint it, I said out of the question. It's perfect for a TV. Come on. - I mean it. Seriously, look. - I know... Kids, kids! Who can do a 360? Dad, we're playing. - No-one. Can you do a 360, or not? - No, but... Want to see a real one? - A what? A real 360? - What is it? I'll show you, come on. A 360 like you've never seen. - Is it dangerous? Yeah, a little. We're about to find out if I can. Dad's by the pond. I don't know what for. What? - He went to the pond. To the pond? Yeah. To do a backflip or something. Where are your friends? - They went with him. A backflip. Okay, that's great, you've made them laugh. Damien! The idiot did it. The water's perfect. Damien, really! It's warm. Come for a swim. Enough! The water's filthy! Stay here, the lot of you! Move sweetie...and you, here... Come on. And the fish? - I forgot the fish. Leave the fish! I forgot the fish, - Damien, seriously! Get the fish, get the fish! How many fish? One, two, three? Come, honey. - I think they're deep down. Fuck. Boo hoo, no fish... We'll eat something else. A lot less fun. Pasta? Go rest a bit, you're too high. Ooh, this little knife's new... Leave it, Damien. The fish! Give us the fish! - There's no fish. Enough kids. Yes, there are. - Yeah, there are fish. Kids, stay here. Honey, you need to rest. Right? No, hands off. You're filthy. Stop it! Show me. - It's private. It's my horoscope. - Show me. Want to hear yours? I'll read you yours. Aquarius... So... Listen up. "'After making a fool of yourself hundreds of times, "'you end up understanding what works', "says singer Gwen Stefani." Ever hear of Gwen Stefani? - Nope. Me neither. "I made a fool of myself so many times "before understanding what works. "I still don't understand everything." "Rest assured, Aquarius. "Looking a fool never killed anyone "but the fear of looking foolish can stifle creativity "and wring the neck of imagination. "Over the next few weeks, "open yourself up to the whackiest of experiences, "without fear of being seen as foolish." Get it? - Yeah. What do you understand? - Everything. Meaning? That you shouldn't... Shouldn't what? You shouldn't... Shouldn't what? You shouldn't feel... Feel what? Ashamed. Yes, you shouldn't feel ashamed. Never feel ashamed. Never. Never be ashamed. Aquariuses aren't ashamed. Aquariuses never feel shame. Stop, Dad. Aquarius feel no shame. Stop, Dad! - Go, I'm tired. Go tell Mum I'm resting. I need to sleep. And shut the door. Shut the door and never feel ashamed. And tell Mum I'm resting. - Yes. Don't forget. Dad, what are you doing? What are you doing, Dad? Look how beautiful it is. Beautiful, isn't it? - Yes. Stop, Dad. You stink. Stop. We can have some fun, right? No, not until you've showered. Come on, stop. Amine? Go to bed. It's still early. That’s nice. Get some rest now. Damien? You need to sleep. Don't worry. It's starting again. - Everything is OK. Damien, I want you to take your pills and go and sleep. OK? If you go back to hospital, I may not be here on your return. I'm fine. I'm on to something. Five? Go on. Do 8...no... 8 plus 5. What's 8 plus 5? Leïla. I'm sorry. No, but... I'm sorry, OK? I heard you. You heard. - Keep going, times 9. How the fuck else can I put it? I'm sorry. It's no big deal. I put everything away, it's fine. Let me get over it, that's all. You are turning things around. That's what you're doing. It's disgusting to turn the tables like that. Disgusting. Damien, stop. Not in front of the kid. You stop! Spare Amine! - You belittle me. Not in front of Amine! I'm warning you! It's nothing, sweetie. Come on. Focus. Can I do some sanding? - No. Is Dad asleep? No, he's in his studio. Go play with Antoine, I'm busy. He just won't get it. He doesn't get it. Call the hospital ? - No, I won't. I'm not his nurse. He has to learn to feel when it's starting. I can tell him? No, he has to decide to take his lithium! I'm not his mother! Don't get all... There's more to my life than constantly nagging him... Fuck this! I'm sorry... Give me a moment, please. Amine. Amine! So? - Yeah. Come, it's late. Let me finish. -Yes, let him. School tomorrow. Let him live a little. He's drawing. Look how beautiful it is. Look, it's you. It's me and you. You're beautiful! No? Oh, you're ashamed? Oh, I see, you're ashamed, Leïla. You always were ashamed. I'm not even allowed to look at you anymore. We're going to die in our stifled little life. No one's ashamed. - Censored lives, nothing allowed! Take your lithium. - We're dying! Amine has school. Don't screw everything up. We need to change. We have to act, it can't go on. Things have to change. We have to leave! We take the kid and make a plan! I need to work more! In New York! New York is where it's happening. Take your lithium, go to bed. I'll call De Corte. Look how beautiful you are! Look! Look! Look at yourself! Take it now and you can avoid the hospital. The second I feel good and have fun, you start telling each other you need to worry. Can't I fucking feel good just a little?! Just a little! Without all of you panicking. Is that possible? Amine. I can't do a fucking thing. It's the legs. The legs are heavy. It's bulky. Stop it... Stop. - It was better over there. You have no problem with this table? - Nope. No problem with this table. Because you never see anything! Not a thing! Amine, what do you think of this table? It's fine. You like it? - Yes. You're sure? - Yes, he likes it. Breaking news: this weekend we change tables. You don't want a new one? - No, I don't, I want you to sit. I'll sit when I feel like it! And I won't be sitting at this table. Definitely not. No desire to whatsoever. Damien, calm down. Not with your hands, my dwarf! - Lay off him! What? Come on, I'm kidding. Just kidding. You're too high. It's starting again. Dad... - I'm fine. I don't want you back in the hospital. There's no reason for me to go back, sweetie. Everything's fine. Mum and I disagree, that's all. What's going on? What is it? Relax. Hey. Sweetie... Come by the studio to give me a kiss. But you need a code now. And don't forget it! The code is three short knocks, wiggly knees, no wolf in sight. Stop it. Don't you worry. It'll be fine. I'll take care of him. Go brush your teeth. I'll be right there. Go to sleep. To be in shape tomorrow. Good night. Can you leave the door open? - Yes. Turn it down a bit, I just put Amine to bed. Here. Take it now. Do it for Amine at least. For fuck's sake... Damien? Damien, I'm tired. Damien, I can't keep this up. Damien? Take it now. This isn't a joke. I can't keep going. I can't keep this up, Damien. Where are you going? I'm not running after you. Fuck! Better, much better. This is an episode, take your lithium! Stop it. Oh, fuck... What are you looking for? I'll take it when I'm in the studio. You need money in the studio? Take it here, in front of me. What's the difference? I said I'll take it. I don't believe you. You don't trust me. - No, I don't. Take it now. So, you don't believe me? - No I don't. So... So, neither of us trusts the other. This isn't funny. - Yes, it is. You're funny. You laughed, look. You're laughing. So... Happy now? Yes, I'm happy now. No way. - Yes, yes. No. No. No... Where is it? You kidding me? I swear. Swallow it now! Stop! Calm down, relax. Fuck! I took it, it came back up. Not my fault. You saw me take it. Go see a shrink. Learn to relax. How can you act so crazy? You're sick. I tried all night long. Yes. He needs to go to the hospital. Can you come and help me? OK. I'll take Amine to the hospi... to school. And we meet back here. Does that work? Thanks. See you in a bit. Where's your bag? - My room. Amine, listen to me. Go to the car and wait for me, okay? Make no noise. Okay? I'll be right there. Go. Here... - I'll take him. No, you rest! Get some rest. You can't drive. Who would you like to drive you, Dad or Mum? Dad, I'd rather Mum drive me to school. Why do you repeat what she says? Go on, get in. Damien, you're not taking him to school! Buckle up. The keys! Stop turning him against me. You're in no state to drive. - Give me the keys! Damien... - I'm fine. Don't I look it? Don't drive in this... - I can take my own son to school! Fuck! Stop, Dad! Dad, stop! Fuck! Wait for Mum. Dad! Stop, Dad. I want Mum to drive me. You're not well. You're sick. Stop, Dad. Here we are. At school. You're OK. Go to class. Wait, wait, big guy. Come on, give Dad a kiss. Give Dad a kiss. Wish Dad a good day. Okay, sweetie? Let's go home. Alright, mate? It's Damien. How's Yohan? You got big and handsome! So handsome. You're shaking him. - You're big. Yohan's off to class. I'll take him back, thanks. Come with me, Damien. Damien! Sir, madam, your masks, please. We don't have them. We're leaving. - Sir, please... Yes, and... can you wait a second, please? I was taking... - They were taking my order. Damien, stop that now! Masks are mandatory in the shop. We don't have masks. Just stop. We're sorry. They're beautiful, really. I'll take this basket. This basket and... Are those cupcakes? Damien, stop! - What's that? Is this nice? - Yes, homemade jam. You've tried it, so you buy it. Fuck! Madam, please. - Delicious. I'll take it all. The basket is just decorative. Doesn't matter, that's fine. Here. This is too much. - Beautiful. I'll come back. The virus isn't Covid... I'm very sorry. Think about Amine, dammit. Look, I've bought for everyone. - You okay? What are you doing? - I bought... What are you doing? Cupcakes for everyone. It's nice out. I suggest we all go to the lake. André can teach the lesson on the way there. No, that takes organisation. Come with me. Stay seated. - They can all swim. Who's on for the lake, kids? Stay here, while I talk to Damien outside. We'll organise it. Amine can teach the non-swimmers. He's the best. Aren't you, son? Gather your things so we're ready to go. Damien, you're not well. - I'm fine. I'm doing great. I bought cupcakes, it's nice out. Why stay inside? Go home. Go with Leïla, get some rest. Damien, please. But... - Damien! What about the lake? No lake, Damien. Drop it, please, Damien. For Amine... Off you go. - He adores you. He really adores you. Go on. I'm sorry. Amine. Mum's taking Dad home. Everything will be fine. You're coming with me. You can't drive in this state. I'll see you back home - Stop, stop. Please stop. Let go of me. You can't drive in that state. Keep your hands the fuck off me! Get lost! Get lost! He almost got them killed. I can't take it anymore. You've blocked the account? - Yes. Tell him Amine is at Antoine's. - Yes. Amine?! Put all this away. Hurry! Put it all away! What's this bike? - Nice, isn’t it ? Don't leave this room, okay? No noise, you hear? Amine? He's at Antoine's. He's at Antoine's. You okay? - Yeah. You? You seem sad. No... - Enjoy yourselves. You're grey, both grey. It's weird to be so grey. It's a shame. You know what? Let me do your portrait here, now. It'll be amazing. Don't move. I'll call them. Hello? Yes, an emergency. 5 rue des Prés. Hurry up, please. Patrick, he's coming. Let's do something big. I'm finished with austerity. I need warmth now. Cold colours depress me. Right, Leïla? Leïla, come. Sit here. There. And Dad... You're good there. Sit down. You're the cupcake God. Hold these. Hold them up like this. That's great like that. This plant hides your knees. We must see your knees. My father's knees. You're beautiful. Show your arm. No, the other one. Show your watch. Cupcakes not too heavy? - No, it's fine. I didn't ask for help. Stay away from me! He's inside. - No, it's him! Damien, listen... I'm perfectly fine. Get out! This is my house! Step back! Calm down. - Step back. I won't go. You won't sleep there. Step back, Dad! Get back in your ambulance. Calm down. No, no...! Damien, stop! You too, get lost. Stop it! - Out! Damien, calm down. Damien, you won't sleep there. - Yeah, right. You won't sleep there. - Your eyes lie. Look into mine. I'm not going back there! - Look at me please... Calm down, look at me. I see it in your eyes. - Look at me. Listen. They'll take you to see De Corte and you come home. A round trip. You'll be home tonight. - Yeah right... You'll come right back. - Will I? Yes, I promise. - I come back? I'll be back here tonight?! I promise. You'll come with me? - Yes. I'll come too. - I swear. Trust me. Trust me, Damien, dammit. I promise you'll come back. Just calm down. Just there and back, I promise. They'll fill me with meds. - No, come. Are you ready? Shall we go? Come the fuck back! You're not going after him? He's sick! But it's not our job, madam. Not your job? Leïla, they don't do that. It's not their job. Thank you, gentlemen. It's not their job. - Not their job... OK. Great. Come here. Where has Dad gone? - I don't know. Don't worry, we're dealing with it. Okay? Damien's not with you? No, no. No, he needs to go back to hospital. If you see him, keep him there and call me. OK? Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. Thanks. Bye. He's not with Serge. Did you call your house? You never know. Yes, Jérôme. No, he hasn't seen him. Okay. Thanks. Kiss. Hi Andre, it's Leïla, can you call me back? Dad? I'm tired. Dad, what are you doing? I'm tired. Dad's in my room. Dad's in your room? Lie down here. Patrick? Patrick? He's in Amine's bed. Call them. Isn't that too tight? - No, it's fine. Have you got his things? - In the car. Madam.... - Goodbye. Aren't you sleeping? Come here. How did it go? - Great. Homework? - He said he had none. Amine! You don't have any homework? No. - Yeah right... Go do it now! No, Mum, we're playing. - It's the tie-break. Finish your game after. Homework first. Get moving. Did they let you see him? - No. Does he get up? - No. He's totally out of it. But it'll be fine. I wanted to see De Corte but he'd left. Don't worry. I'll take care of that. - Thanks for Amine. Let me help. - I'm fine. Thanks. - See you soon, Leïla. Sorry, I didn't see it coming. Yeah, I noticed. What will you do? - Prolong Corinne's exhibition. Piet's ready, the problem is Lyon, that’s screwed. Is he at Saint Luc? - Yes. Tell me when I can visit. You're okay? - Yeah, I'm good. Don't hesitate to call. Goodbye, Serge. You think we'll be done in time? - Want me to call? Can you? - For tomorrow? No, the day after. 6 pm? - So we have time to wrap it. I'll text him now. - Great. Are you selling this? - To a big client. For more than you can afford. And this one? No, I'm not selling you that. I'll find you a better one for less. I find lots of them...Yes. - Really? Look here. This, for your couch. Colette, what shall we bring tonight? Nothing. We can’t come empty-handed. - Everything's ready. But no masks tonight, right Colette? Amine! Amine! Amine! It's in here. Ah, my love. Come here. All night! Thank you, Colette! And thank you, Pascal! Got it? Here Dad. - Thank you. Go brush your teeth. Here. - I'll let in some fresh air. You can't spend all day alone in the dark. Here. I'm off...Bye. - Yep...Bye. Can you help me? - Yes. Sit up. Come on, one, two, three... You OK? It's easier on this side. One, two, three. OK? Yes. Thanks. It'll do you some good. Thanks, I'll finish. - OK. Yes. You good? - Yeah. What's wrong? I'm bored. Well... go read a book. I don't have a book. Are you kidding? You have no books in your room? Amine, please, I can't make any mistakes. They're important accounts, go find something to do. Go on. Amine? Come on, Dad. - Stop. Don't jump on me. - Come on. Get up, Dad. - No. Get up! Put one foot on the floor. One foot. I can't get up. - Come on! Dad, get up! Start with one foot. One foot on the floor. Did you put one on the floor? Now, you get up. Get up. Stand up. Come on, get up. Stand straight. You look like a zombie. Like this, nice and straight. Walk to the door and I'll make you an orange juice. Come on. Come on, Dad. Make the juice. I need five minutes, close the door. Go on. I need peace and quiet. See you tomorrow. Did you have fun? Yeah. So, Amine, was it fun? Hey, Amine, I'm talking to you. You didn't have to come along, Dad. Mum could have come to pick me up on her own. Thanks. That's fine. - But it's three drops. I called, I can go down to two. Since when are you down to two? Who did you speak to? They're okay with it. I told them I was too... Who "they"? Who did you talk to? - Kleber. And De Corte? I couldn't reach De Corte. He's the one treating you. Kleber knows my file...They talk. - Not like De Corte. He's not worried. And he agreed three is too many. We're not obliged to talk about it now. Surely, I can manage my own medication? Dad, you could take one more drop. No, honey. Have you had enough? You can go now. Humiliating me won't make things better. You want to try lithium? See the state you're in after three drops. Stop the 24-hour surveillance. - I can't. You want to end up back in the hospital? I hate this too. What do we do if you hate this, if we're all fed up, you're fed up, I'm fed up. what do we do? I don't know. Don't give me that look. Not that look. If I can't even look at you anymore. What should I tell him? What should I tell him? Not to be ashamed of me like this. He's a child! Put yourself in his shoes! You could talk to him. - That's not my job. It's not! He's just there! Go on, go talk to him! Yeah. You're ashamed too. - Stop. Stop with that. Fuck. Listen, until you recover, try not to add more pressure. Fuck. Put yourself in his shoes. This is hard for him. Everything that's happened! Imagine your dad comes to your class, with all your friends there, acting crazy like you did. What would you do? How would you react? Stop, it's not easy for me. And it is for us? Is it easy for us? Do you think this is easy for us? If you'd taken your lithium, things would've been different. Forget me. Tell everyone I'm dead. Less shame for everyone. You will be less ashamed. You know what? You forgot me. Do you look at me? Do you ever look at me? No, because all I do is look after you! All I do is watch over you! Just look at me! Look at me, goddammit! I've put on 15 kgs in two years! I don't take care myself, I never think about myself! Don't you... Don't ever say that to me again. I swear, don't ever say it again. See you later. - Where you going? For a drive. - Can I come? No, I told you to stay with Dad. Where's Mum going? - I don't know. Bedtime, bedtime. - It's only 9 o'clock. It's late. Where's Amine? Waiting for you. Where were you, Mum? I was at Colette's. Go to sleep. I'm going to leave. I'll stay at my dad's. Okay. And what do we tell Amine? That I'll be back once I'm better. Did you go on the tractor? Amine? - What? Did you ride the tractor? - I told you I did. You didn't. - Did too. Go to sleep late? - No. About what time? - Nine. And what did Dad do? Nothing. He watched TV. Where did you sleep? - Dad's room. And Dad? - I don’t know. You're a pain, Mum! Did he take his lithium? Yes. Did you see him take it? Mum, leave me the hell alone! Dad!... Yeah. - You okay? Put your bike in the trunk? Go on. I'll go get a few things. Happy? - My bike. All good? You look good. Yeah, I feel much better. I checked, the forecast is good. Want to come to the lake with us? You're not going to the lake. Why not? - I don't know... I didn't prepare anything. He has a presentation Monday. And it's a three-hour drive. Come with us. - No, it's not a good idea. Not the lake. Spend the night at your dad's. He can work at the lake. Nonsense. Yes, I can. I know my presentation by heart. Can we still do stuff together, or...? It's too early. You can go to the lake later. And... You're not ready yet. I'm not ready? First I look good, now I'm not ready. Are you crazy? I'm saying no to the lake. Sorry. Mum says no to the lake. I'll come tomorrow. I didn't say you can't take him, I said no to the lake! See you tomorrow. I'll go help Grandpa. You're not taking him? Seriously? - See you tomorrow. You said I'm not ready, right? Why no lake? - Because I said so! You're a pain in the ass! What now? Amine. Amine, open the door. Open up now, or tomorrow no... Amine, open. Why couldn't I go with Dad? Because Dad's sick. The lake can wait, okay? Calm down, Amine. You're the sick one, dumb bitch! Don't talk to me like that! Apologise. Apologise immediately! You won't apologise? Dad has a great excuse with his damn illness... All I do in life is take care of both of you! You think it's easy for me? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. How was it? Did the presentation go well? Amine, how did your presentation go? I forgot everything once was in front of the class. I have to do it over. No big deal. We'll go back over it. It'll be fine. Magma is molten rock that leaves by the chimney and forms lava. The heat of lava... is 200... No, 1200 degrees centipede. Celsius. - No, centipede. Celsius. - Centipede. Good, you know it. I don't want to hear you say you 'suck' anymore. Just don't panic when you're in front of everyone. All right? So, I officially declare that you know your stuff and it's fine. Dad? - Yes? Can you stay? Grandpa's waiting for me. Please, Dad! - Yes, do. You don't mind? - Nope. Thanks. What's up? It's no good. What isn't? - Not good. It's no good. What's no good? No good at all. Breaking news, this weekend we change tables. The legs... They're vulgar. No good. Really? So what do we do? Get a new one. Really? Come sit down. I'm not sitting at this table. Really? And can I stay at the table? Even if it's ugly, yes? - That's fine. Thank you. Dad? When you coming back? - Tomorrow. Sleep well. Do you mind me coming back to work in the studio? What for? Serge gave me an advance. I need to start working again. We'll expose when I'm ready. No pressure. No working nights. I'll structure myself. You're both completely irresponsible. What was Serge thinking? How can you start again with him? He's my gallerist and I need to work. Each time you start calmly, but you know what always happens. It's so obvious. I don't need to explain. Enough. I checked with De Corte. He says it's fine if I take things slow. I won't stop my therapy or my meds. I'll be careful. I'm sick of being at my dad's. You're fine, until you can't take it, then you let go. You know you can't paint without pressure. This time I'll manage to. I'm vigilant, Leïla. I'm careful constantly, all the time. I'm a painter. It's my job, it's my life. During my episodes, my work sucks. Who will believe you now? De Corte... and Serge. They trust me. Do they live with your episodes? Do they take care of your kid? When you go berserk? And come back from the hospital a vegetable? Are they there for you? Sorry, but you see... I... I knew it. I told you I couldn't anymore. I can't take it. I hate being in this state. I'm sick of always being like this. I'll pick him up from school tomorrow. Hey Benoit. Is Serge upstairs? Yes. What the hell? Starting up again, when he's only just got out? There's no date. He chooses his pace. You know how frail he is. He'll relapse immediately. Don't pressure him! I don't. - You do! No. - Yes! He came to see me. I'm not going to refuse. Don't profit from him. - He profits too. You can't wait for him to get better? At some point, he needs this. You know that. For him, painting... - Let him get better! Why now? Leïla, I know this is hard... You know jackshit! Don't you see he's doing well? If he relapses, you take care of him. I'm over with this. We both know that he needs to paint! So sorry... - Hey, Leïla, you good? Can you tell Amine I'm here? Amine left 20 minutes ago with Damien. Yes. - You okay? Yeah, yeah, great. See you tomorrow. Is Amine here? Hello to you too. - Is he here? Yeah. - You tell me when you get him. Never again without telling me! Are you crazy? I told you yesterday. I said I'd go get him. What do you want? You prefer I never see my son again? His father's too sick, too scary. - I never said that. It's simple, tonight, he sleeps here and you leave. Excuse me? You don't have any of his stuff. We'll manage. Well let me see him, give him a kiss. Lay off! - I want to kiss my son. Tonight's my night, so leave. For two months, everything I say or do, I'm crazy. So, now, leave me alone. Leave us alone. Two days. Two days, before he's back in the hospital. You'll see. But he's taking his meds... - No! Of course he's not taking them. Stop. And even if he does, you think bipolarity is curable? It's a psychosis. There's no cure. Ask any psychiatrist. Any psychiatrist. I'm the idiot. I am. I'm the idiot for believing every time. Is Damien here? They took the boat to the lake. Why did you let them go? He's starting an episode. No, he's fine. He's well rested. Didn't he tell you? - No, he didn't. Is he taking his meds? - Yes. I mean, that's what he tells me. Call De Corte. Tell him. Immediately. You bloody fool. Fuck! Amine, get in the car. Get in the car. Get in! - No. Get in. - No Mum. Get the lifejackets. - You're completely reckless. You're not well enough yet. - I'm well, he's well. You can't take him boating without telling me. Stop. It's too soon. - Stop with that. I won't stop. - Stop. Leïla, I can promise to pay attention, to be careful, but I can't promise I'll cure. Okay. Amine! Go with Mum. No, I want to stay with you. - Go with Mum!
