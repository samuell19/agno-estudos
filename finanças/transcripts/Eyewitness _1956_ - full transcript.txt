Hello darling. - Well you're late. l know. l'm sorry, l stopped in at mothers for a cup of tea. Well come on in l've got something to show you. You can wait until l get my things off. - lt won't take a minute. Now come on. Well, how do you like it? Where'd you get it? From Tom. lt's a new twenty-one inch job. Is it pais for? -The first installment. We've got eighteen months to pay the rest. l thought we agreed, we wouldn't take on any more commitments. Oh, l know but, uh, well, uh, this is different. That's right, this ones going back. What's the matter, don't you like it? - Well of course l like it but we can't afford it. You know that. Buts it's only just over three pounds a month. l know and the building society is only eleven pounds a month. And the cooker and the refrigerator, the installments on the furniture. Nothing we've got really belongs to us. Supposing you were ill for a month or two or l wanted to quit my job, then what would happen? We'd manage somehow. Oh, darling, l don't want us to manage somehow. l want us to pay our way. - That's what we are doing. No we're not. We're just running into debt. Everything will be worn out long before we've finished paying for it. Your just tired darling. - l am not tired. l'm serious. Take it back! - l told Tom we'd have it. Then tell him you've changed your mind. Well what will he think of us? - l don't care what he thinks. Well he's your brother. He's got to make a living just same as everybody else. Well he can do it without running us into debt. l mean it Jay either that set goes or l do. l promised Tom. l can't go back on my word. All right. Where are you going? - Out! Anywhere out of this house. Now your just being silly. Maybe, but l'm not coming back until that's out of the house so you can please yourself which it's going to be. Lucy! He wanted to give his wife all those little extras which he present can't afford. The result has been disastrous. And now the wife has written to me for advise. She still loves him very much but she can't bear this financial nightmare any longer. Should she leave him for his own sake? By that she means, would perhaps the shock bring him to his senses once and for all? Hello baby, going dancing? Don't look like that. Okay. - One. One. One. Merry mints, merry mints, too good to hurry mints. Why make haste when you can taste the hint of mint in merry mints. Merry mints, merry mints, too good to ... Excuse me. Thank you. Please, where's the phone? Oh, it's in the passage madam. l'll show you. Thank you. Look, you go through those doors, down the passage and halfway down you turn left. The phones right in front of it at the end. You can't miss it. - Thank you. Oh! l've dropped me gloves. - perhaps in your pocket. No, no l had them on my lap. l know l did. Well look in your bag then. No there not in here. l ... l know there not. l'll have to go back for them. - Where was you sitting madam? Oh, on the second row on the right. - Third row on the left. Well come inside and l'll see if l can help you find them. Hey, what do you think you're doing? Oh! - Get out. Ah! What's the matter? What's happened? - Ran straight into it.. ls she dead? - Looks like it. Call for the ambulance. Cigarette? Light. Aren't we going to get started? Not yet, l want to see what happened to the girl. What for?. - She saw us. She can indentify us. Well she's dead, isn't she? - Did you go to her funeral? Sorry l can't hear you This thing must of got bumped when l was running down those stairs. What'd you say? Did you see her buried. No but ... - Well, then lets not jump to conclusions. Good evening Mr. Church. - Hello Tom, half a bitter please. You're quiet tonight. - Yep. Harry Waters been in? - Nope. l haven't seen him this week. Huh, well what about the rest of the boys, uh, Jack Stewart? Moved up north. Didn't you know? - No. Oh well, old Bill Right sure to turn up. - Not him. Got married last month. Oh! -Don't usually see much of them after that. Quite a stranger yourself you know. Same again Tom. - Oi. Can't we go now? - All in good time. l don't know what you're worring about. You don't know when you're well off. Well off. - Yeah. You say you want to go to New Zealand but you can't afford the fare. All right, l see you want the fare, l'll get it for you. Here it is. lf we ever get the chance to use it. You'll use it all right. Nobody's got anything on us. Aaaah! Aaaah! - Come on snap out of it. lt's all right for you. l've never done anything like this before. And you're not going to again. - You're dead right l'm not. When l get to New Zealand l'm going to settle down and work at my trade. Well, you do that. - lf l ever get to New Zealand. Just open the safe you said. You're a locksmith, nothing to it. You never said nothing about clocking the manager. l didn't know he was going to walk in like that, did l? Well you said he never came up to the office before ten. And he never did before. Not for the last three weeks anyway. Well, l still don't know what you wanted to clock him for. l don't see what you wanted to clock him for. That's a fine way to talk isn't it. You know you ought to smarten yourself up a bit. Look at me. l used to talk like that but not anymore. The trouble with you is you haven't got any ambition. You ought to be like me, l'm going places. lf they don't catch up with you first. Nobody's going to catch up with me because nobody's got anything on me. Nobody can stop me because l know what l'm doing. Do you hear, nobody! Do you see there. l bet they've found him. So what. Nothing to do with us. l reckon we ought to blow. - All in good time. Ah. l've been having a bit of a bad time just here recently. Have you? - Oh terrible. You see, one of the things l cannot stand is sulks and bad temper. So, when she starts snapping at me, l snap right back. l said, l know exactly what you want my girl. l said, l said, you need a pill and no food till tomorrow. And did it work? - Did it work. Blimey, like a charm. Mind you, l had a bit of trouble getting the pill down her, you know. Oh, struggling like a mad thing she was. And of course she started crying when she realized she wasn't going to get any supper but l knew how to deal with that. You see l've always thought that a touch of the old whip is much kinder in the long run. And l was right. l was right. The next morning she was right as rain and as loving as you could ask for. Yes, l had a Cocker Spaniel once like that. Well, there you are. Cheerio. - Cheerio. Better give them ten minutes to take a look at her. You think the police will be at the cinema yet? l expect so. - Well, what will they do? Well, look for fingerprints. That's all right, they won't find any. And then they will be telephoning headquarters. Stopping all cars leaving the town, setting up road blocks. Well then, what's going to happen to us? Nothing. And you know why, because l'm smarter. Anybody else would have used a stolen car but not me. l hire one. Self drive, all above board Anyone else, you for instance, would have gone tearing out of town straight into the arms of the police. But not me, l attend to more important things. Well, what are we going to do then? They'll see you. Wake me up in about ten minutes. Well that's it, sir. - All right. Patrol car reports all roads out of the city blocked, sir. Good. - Chief constable is on his way over. Right, and this is his? l haven't traced her yet sir, she's out with friends. Babysitter doesn't know which friends or where. Whose the babysitter? Oh, just a young girl. - You didn't say anything to her?. Oh no sir, of course not. - Well good. Nothing here sir. Everythings been rubbed off. Clean as a whistle. Uh-huh, anything in there? - Nothing at all, sir. lt's an unusual job. Looks more like a locksmith. This chap must have known what he was doing. Get on the blower to the Yard. l want to talk to criminal records. - Right sir. Hello. Any luck sister? - No doctor. Lipstick, powder compact, bunch of keys, handkerchief, mm, a bag of bulleyes. l hope you're keeping count sister. Jolly interesting but it doesn't tell us who she is. No name on any of the clothes? No, there's just laundry marks and makers labels. There is this. lt's got an inscription on the back. L with love from J. Poor J. He's in for a bit of a shock. She's the one with the concussion. Well, we'll just have to wait until she comes around or somebody claims her. She's a pretty little thing. l wouldn't mind claiming her myself. - Come in. The accident case is ready in casualty. - All right. Thank you nurse. Half a bitter please Joe. - Coming up. Hello Mr. Church, your quite a stranger. Yes sir, l suppose l am. Hello Jamie boy, where have you been hiding yourself? l haven't seen you in here for months. - No, l've, uh, l've been busy. Oh, want to play snooker, there'll be a table for you tonight? All right. - How's Lucy? Okay. -Everything going according to plan l hope. Uh-huh. You're very talkative tonight. Sorry, not feeling to bright. How's Doris? Oh, don't ask me dear boy. l don't know and l don't care. She's gone to her mothers for the weekend and as far as l'm concerned l hope she stays there. Hum. - lf she were home do you think l'd be here enjoying myself getting pleasantly whistled with my pals. Oh no. No, l'd be sitting there listening to her and her mother and that poppy nosed sister of hers just talking. Yakety yakety yakety yakety yakety yak. Until you think it will drive you around the bend. Still let's not talk about unpleasant subjects. Hey come on, drink up. This ones on me. Hey. Hey! lt's ten minutes. Oh. Right. Coppers. - Where? Oh you clot, have you got any coppers, pennies? Oh, well, how many do you want? Three of course. How many did you think? Hello, Barrow Hospital, press association here. l'm checking on the report about a girl knocked down by a bus in your area. Yes, in the High Sreet, we understand. Well, you'll have to ring back later on. She's only just been brought in. No. No, she's not dead. l'm afraid l can't tell you that. - Oh. Well, no identification at all? l see. Thanks very much. Good bye. Are we going now? - Not yet. You find out about the girl? - Yeah. ls ... is she dead? No, not yet. l can't help thinking the girl wasn't the only one who saw us. What are you talking about? Well the manager, he saw us too. - Oh no. No? - He only saw you, not me. And you won't be here will you. You'll be on the boat to New Zealand. You better have your fare now. How much was it? Was it one hundred and twenty? There's a hundred and fifty. Keep the rest as spending money. - ls that all that l get? That's what we agreed, isn't it. - l thought l was going to get half. Did l ever say half? Well you did when we was ... - Well who planned the job? Well you did. - And who paid all the expenses? Hiring the car and things like that. - You did. Well all right. l'll put it away for Petes sake. What are you worring about? l can't help thinking about the manager. - What about it? You didn't ought to bit him like that. That's robbery with violence. You can get ten years for that. - Oh, cut it out. l didn't want to come in the first place. lt was you who talked me in into it. Just opening the safe you said, nothing to it. Even if you get caught, first offence six months, maybe only three. But robbery with violence. l didn't want no part of that. Shut up. Do you hear. Shut up. Shut up! - She shouldn't have been there. You ought what you're doing. You might have broken it, then where would l be? Listen, can you hear me? - Yes. Now listen to me. Listen. There's nothing to get steamed up about. We're okay as long as you can keep your trap shut and stop behaving like a frightened baby. There's nothing they can do to us, unless the girl talks. Even if they pick us up they haven't got enough evidence to get us on it unless the girl talks. So we'll just wait and see how she makes out. Got it! lf she dies we're in the clear. And if she doesn't? - Then we'll have to think again. Where we going now? - You'll see. Ha. There you are, another nice lock for you to pick. What you want to get in there for? You'll see. Try to be a bit quicker this time. Well, l was a quick as l knew how. - l'm not blaming you. l'm not saying if you'd been a bit slicker opening that safe, we'd been out of there before the manager walked in and then l shouldn't have to hit him. Oh, uh, a bit stiff. lt's a bit rusty. Can you move the car so that the lights shine on it? No, l've got things to do with the car. You'll have to manage with this. What you doing? - Can't you see? ls the gate open? - Not yet. We'll get on with it. Where you going? Put the car down there in the side turning. But how am l to know that your not going to er ... Don't you trust me? Of course but ... Look chum, if you want to park a car for a bit, park it outside a house with the light on. Doesn't look so conspicuous. Get it. Yes. - Then get a move on with that gate. What's the matter?. Did you think l'd run out on you? No. No. - Then what are you running for? l was frightened. Look Wade, l don't want to go in there. l want to get out now while we can. And run right into the police. - But they got nothing on us. The car's not hot, you said so yourself. Listen Barney, there's a girl in there whose got us both right there in the palm of her hand. l want to know what's happened to her and l'm going to find out. You can pull out if you like. l'm not stopping you. But you'll have to walk. Now make up your mind, which is it going to be? l'll stay with you. - Sure? Yeah. - Then we'll have no more argument. What about the gate? Well, it's open. - Nice work Barney. And l'm glad l brought you. The boy's all said l was a mug to touch anyone with one of these. But l wasn't. You're all right Barney. - Am l? Your as good as the next one. Come on. She'll be in casualty, l expect. l'm going to take a look. You stay here, all right. Nurse. Nurse, that lights shining right in my eyes. Am l supposed to go to sleep with all the lights full up? Oh, talking can be so oppressing darn gloomy. l'm supposed to have some attention too, you know. That's what l pay my National Health for. Nurse! Oh, there you are. No granny, do be quiet and go to sleep. How can l go to sleep with the lights full on bleeding in my eyes. There's only the one extra light on. - Well it hurts my eyes anyway. Well you'll just have to turn over the other way, won't you. l can't, you know if l lay on my right side, it hurts my leg. Well you'll just have to try. Oh. - Now come on, turn over. Nurse. Oh, why can't you leave me be. My goodness, what a mess you got yourself into. Your comfort come from squared off pillows. Oh, what is it, casualty? Go to sleep and don't ask so many questions. Mm, is she bad? Oh, l thought so. Uh-huh, come to finish her off, eh? Doctor, how is she? ls she going to snuff it? You go to sleep granny. Oh ... - You heard what the doctor said. Go to sleep. Whew! She'll do sister. - l wish we knew who the poor thing is. l alway feel so sorry for the relatives on these occasions. We'll hear soon enough. Keep an eye on her nurse. Let me know if she regains consciousness or starts talking. Yes, doctor. - Thank you, sister. Nurse! There's a man out there. Out there! Outside those windows, a man. - Sssh! You'll have the whole hospital awake. - l just saw a man. Now granny, if you don't keep quiet and behave yourself l'll put you in an observation ward. And you would to if you got half a chance, l know you. Guinea pigs, that's all we are to you. Just guinea pigs. My neighbor says your lucky if you get out of one these places with all of your inside left. All right. - You better give her a sedative sister. She's starting to see things again. All right, you can roll out the dice, l saw him right enough. He was outside that window looking in. l saw him and l saw his shadow. Now just to put Mrs. Hudson's mind to rest nurse, go out and see if there is a man there. All right, but l'm quite sure there isn't. All right sister, l'll go. ls anyone there? Sorry granny, nobody there. - Huh! Of course not. Like the frogs you saw last night, we turned the whole ward upside down. There were frogs, two of them, under her bed. l never saw any frogs. Of course you didn't, there weren't any. Now keep Mrs. Hudson quiet nurse. Some people are really ill and need to sleep. Doctor. - Yes, granny? l think you'd better move me to that observation ward. l might get a little sleep there. Now that's quite enough, Mrs. Hudson. There. There comfy? - No, l'm not. l'm missing my feather bed and my hot water bottles gone cold. What the hell do you think you're doing? - l'm tired of waiting. l didn't know you had a gun. - There's a lot of things you don't know. Was it her? l don't know l couldn't see. - Well, they saw you, didn't they? No, l was to quick for them. What are you going to do now? Give them five minutes to settle down, and then go and have another look. l think she's dead. You mean, you wanna go? - Well couldn't we? No, when l start something, l see it through. Right through, till the end. The nurse is still there. Well, she'll go off in a minute to make some tea or some smores or something. They always do. Well we might have to wait an hour. - Then we'll wait an hour. Two hours if we have to. Or three. Or four. Office ... the safe ... Well, you won't be seeing the office for a week or two. The safe ... Hitting ... Hurting him ... l'm not asleep. - Well, you ought to be. Nurse, may l have a drink of water? - Yes, all right, just a minute. She's gone out. Quiet Strike. Hello. Strike, l've got something for you. There. You're late this evening, aren't you? Yes, they just brought in a mortuary job. Oh, who? - Manager of the Coronet Cinema. He's got three bullets in him. A couple of chaps broke in and emptied his safe. When he tried to stop them they filled him with lead, just like that. Oh, that's awful. l was there the night before last and l can remember seeing him. He's got a wife and two kids they tell me. l'd like to get my hands on them fellows. They wouldn't be so tough when l finish with them. Well, l'll fix you a nice cup of tea next time you come around. Thank you very much. - See you just after the hour then. We'll be there. What did he say? - l couldn't hear. l could. He said the manager was shot. Did he? You've got a gun. You shot him. While l was running after her, you shot him. You catch on fast, don't you? But if he's dead then ... Well go on, say it. A six letter word beginning with M. And you know what that means. - No not me, l didn't touch him. That won't help you. You were there. Keep back. l want to go. l want to get out of here. You go and you'll walk right into a murder rap. What are you worring about? l haven't let you down yet, have l? - You shot him. l had to because you were so long opening that safe. But nobodies got anything on us. Nobody, except that girl. We can't, we ... - Now you sit down and have a nice quiet cry. But keep it quiet! Do you want a dog to get you? - No. Now leave thing to me. l know what l'm doing. l've got it all worked out. Nurse. Bad night? l can' sleep. Oh, go on, of course you can if you try. Let me tuck you in. Mom will come tomorrow, won't she? Yes, she'll be here at nine o'clock in the morning and she'll take you home in a nice big taxi. Good. Good night nurse. - Good night Molly. Nurse! Nurse! The place is full of men. Nurse! Nurse! Was that you calling, Mrs. Hudson? - Of course it was me calling. There's men out there, all five of them. Granny, really! - Now don't you granny me. Now l've seen them, l tell you. - How many? Well, two. Mm, perhaps three. l can still count you know. Nurse, l'm frightened. Well, there's nothing to be frightened of Molly. The patrol man went by five minutes ago. Well he didn't see anyone who didn't have a right to be there. What! ln seventy acres of land. What's he got, eyes in the back of his head? Oh, now come on Molly, you mustn't cry. Aren't you a girl guide? - Yes. Well, l thought girl guides were supposed to smile cheerfully in the face of all difficulties. Well this one don't. Why does she keep saying she sees men and doesn't? Because she does! Be quiet Mrs. Hudson. Now don't take any notice of her. She goes to sleep and has a bad dream and then she wakes up and thinks it's real. lf your so sure l'm dreaming why don't you go outside and have a look. Because l'm far to busy. You mean your afraid someone's waiting to put a black sack over your head. Oh don't be so silly, Mrs. Hudson. Oh well silly or not, they're outside there cause l've seen them. Nurse. Nurse. Lucy? Lucy? Hello, Elspeth. lt's Jay. Fine thanks. How are you? Good. Look, l just wondered, is Lucy with you? l see him. lt's got to stop. Stop it ... Stop this. No, no! Ah, they're coming for me! Jay ... Jay! l can see you in the office. Now it's all right. There's nothing to worry about. Ah! Where am l? Your safe. Quite safe. Now lie down. Nurse! - That's right, l'm a nurse and l'm looking after you. l must get up! l must get away! No, no, come on, lie down. Now, what's your name? Stop it. No! No! Ooh! Hello, Dr. Brad, could you come down to Elizabeth Ward. The emergency regained consciousness. Yeah. What are you doing here? l saw you through the screens. l saw you pick up that pillow. You were going to kill her, weren't you? Suppose l was. - l won't stand for it, see. Oh, you won't stand for it. - No. l didn't want you to kill the manager. lf l'd have known what you was going to do, l would have stopped you. Well it's too late now but your not going to touch her, see. Did you hear what she said? - No. Then l'll tell you. She was saying the cinema managers dead. He's been murdered. And l can pick out the boys, the two boys, who did it. Just bring them in and l can identify them. - l don't care what she said. l just want you to leave her alone, that's all. You want! Since when have you been giving the orders? l'm the one whose running this show and what l say goes. And the sooner you get that into your thick head, the better. l don't like people who get in my way. l won't stand for it! Look Wade, l'll ... l'll do anything you say, only let's get out of here. Please. Take your hands off me! lf you've lost your nerve you can go but l'm staying! Please! - No! You've got to come. Please. Oh! Oh! Get out! Get out! - l Can't hear you. Where is it? Where is it? There you are. Help yourself. Did you get her name, nurse? No, she just keeps talking about the office and how she must get away. lt's almost as though she were frightened of something. Yes. That bus, l shouldn't wonder. Come on Strike, steady. Hey there, stop! Get him! Stay, Strike, stay! Now man, what are you up to, eh? Come in. Found Mrs. Hayes, sir, she's outside. Mrs. Hayes? - The wife, sir. Oh yeah. - Bring her in Sergeant. Right sir. Will you come in please? lt's lnspector Reardon, isn't it? - Good evening. What happened? Where's Harry at? They ... they wouldn't tell me anything downstairs. Won't you sit down Mrs. Hayes. - Thank you. Mrs. Hayes, your husband has been a victim of an attack. Victim? - There was a robbery here tonight. He surprised the thieves. Yes, but ... l rather you told me straight out please. ls Harry hurt? He was killed Mrs. Hayes. No! No ...! How am l going to tell the boys? They worship him. What's that! Aunt Edith, is Lucy with you? She isn't. No, no, no, there's nothing wrong, l ... l just thought if she was with you l could run around to meet her. Well she ... she usually leaves a note if she goes out but she must have forgotten. Yes ... yes l expect so. Yes ... Yes l'll tell ... Good bye. Come in. Now Gabriel you know we can't have that dog in here, take him out at once. l wanted to see if you were all right, sister. - Of course, l'm all right. What did you expect.

What's he doing with all that money on him, that's what l want to know. lnto the dogs, l expect. What in the middle of the night in our kitchen garden? All right, sister, l'll be just outside if you want me. Now, uh, l'm afraid this is going to hurt a little. Sorry about that. l'm nearly finished now. l expect you could do with a glass of tea, couldn't you? l'll get a nurse to make you one when we're through. Your not very talkative are you? l thought you weren't coming. l got held up by the police, this side of the camp. By the police? lt's all right honey, they weren't looking for me.

Oh! l'll have to get matrons permission first of course but she'll be all right. She's a romantic old thing. And your not, l suppose. Me! l'm just dizzy. l've got it all figured out. We can take the car and go up into the Catskills or someplace. l figured on taking you to Rome or Venice but there isn't time for that l guess. l don't mind where we go. l suppose you know that as the wife of an American Officer serving overseas your entitled to transporation to the station where your husband is serving.

The whole ward's seven sisters are on the warpath. Did l upset them? No of course not but l'll have to be there. Well l could come back later or l could just sit here. No you can't do that, sister might come in and catch you. She's quite likely to. She pokes her nose into everything. Well what do l tell he CO. You tell him ... tell him the girls crazy about you. On the level. - On the level. When do l see you? Well, l'll go to see matron directly l've come off duty. Then l really ought to sleep for a few hours. Only l know l'll be to excited. You call for me at twelve. - Okay, then we'll be married at one. Uh-huh. - Are you sure you can make it by twelve? Yes, l think so. Four hours sleep, two hours to dress and pack. Oh! Oh gosh, what shall l wear?. Anything except that uniform. What's a matter, don't you like it? lt crackles every time l kiss you. You want to know something, so do l. Oh, darling, you have to go. Okay, if l get back now l can catch the CO before he turns in. He's playing poker with the boys. l'll phone you as soon as it's all right. Okay? Yes, the only thing is we're not allowed phone calls at night. lt's against the rules. - To hell with the rules. This is a special occasion. Good bye. Sister!. What are you running for nurse, is there a fire? Huh! Oh no, they want you in maternity. Mrs. Harris is beginning. Very well nurse, they want me in maternity. Please tell them l'm on my way. - Yes sister. And nurse. - Yes sister? There's still no need to run - Yes sister, l mean, no sister. Now Mrs. Hudson, off to sleep with you. l don't feel sleepy. l feel funny. lf you've poisoned me, l'll have the law on you. See if l don't. - Come on. You go to sleep now and stop worrying. - All right. Who's there. lt's me. - What do you want? Are you Mr. Sugdon? Yes. - Well, l'm Jay Church. Are you, well, what of it? Well ... well, my wife knows your wife. They used to go to school together. Now look if you came around here in the middle of the night and woke the baby up, just to tell me your wife went to school with my wife, then you ought to be certified. No, no you don't understand. You see, l thought my wife was here with you. Well she isn't! There isn't anybody here except me and my wife and my baby. And if it's any interest to you it took three hours just to get the kid to go to sleep and now l suppose it will take another three. Well l'm sorry, it's just that l thought Lucy was here. Look chum, if you've lost your wife, the best thing you can do is go to the police. Oh, l'm so sorry. Now, who are you and what do you want? The names Cammon, Henry Cammon. Husband of Mrs. Cammon. Well Mr. Cammon, what are you doing here? Well, Mrs. Cammon's having twins. They won't tell me how she is and l've been waiting for hours and l am suffering. So l was looking for her. Nurse, where do they do maternity here? l want to see for myself how she's getting on. Mr. Cammon you won't be very welcome in maternity if your wife's having twins. Now look, you go right back to the waiting room and someone will make you a nice cup of coco to calm you down a bit. And as soon as she can, sister will tell you how your family is. Family! Yes! That's what we'll be now, won't we nurse? Well, l ... l'm sorry if l made a nuisance of myself but ... well it's the first time and Mrs. Cammon's nearly forty. Well that's nothing now days Mr. Cammon. - Mrs. Cammon reckons it is. Now look, you got right along this path until you get to the main building. ln through the double doors and the waiting room straight ahead of you, got it? Yes, thank you. - And mind you, stay there. They're probably looking for you already. Well, do you think they might be? Well, thank you nurse, thank you. Yes sir, what can we do for you? Uh, l've lost my wife, l think. No wives in the lost and found tonight. Just a couple of lost dogs and a buggery guard they took of the Chapel Hill bus. What's the matter son? Didn't she come home? - No. l ... l wondered if there been an accident? - Just a minute. Do you know what she was wearing? - Yes, a blue dress and a yellow coat. Fair or dark? - Fair. Age? - Twenty-two. Now look son, there was a girl who answers to this description knocked down by a bus outside the Coronet Cinema tonight. Where is she? What happened to her? She isn't dead? No she's not dead. She's in the Barrow General Hospital. Only nobody knows who she is on account there's no identification on her. You best go out and see if she's yours. - Thanks Sergeant. Now just a minute. Give us your name and address. Church, Jay Church, a 127 Madison Road. Er, how did you get here? l walked. - That's what l thought. Just a second. l may be able to get you a lift. We've got a car going out on patrol in about ten minutes. Get you up there quicker than walking. Hello. Nurse! Mr. Cammon, l thought l told you to stay in the waiting room. Yes l know and l did, but l have to tell you, it's happened. All ready? Well that's wonderful. How's Mrs. Cammon? - She's all right. She's had three. - Three! Oh, congratulations. - Yes, the x-ray said it was only two. Doctor reckons one of them must have been hiding. Oh, Mr. Cammon, l'm so pleased for you. Are they boys or girls? All girls. What's your name, nurse? Me? Marston. No, no, your christian name. - Oh, Penny, Penelope. Then it's Gladys, Emma, and Penelope. You don't mind, do you? - Mm, no of course not, l'm very flattered. But you know, l really think you ought to be going back. l'm sure they're looking for you by now. Come on. -Yes right nurse. Thank you for everything. Nurse. Nurse. l'm sorry. Oh Jay. You know what to do. l'm sorry. Excuse me. Have you seen nurse? l've been ringing for ages. No, l haven't. Wondering where l am. Nurse. l must tell. Must tell him. l must get out. Where are you taking her? To the operating theatre. Are they going to cut her up? Only a little bit. You're going the wrong way, you know. When they're going to cut them up, they take them that way. lt's quicker this way. - Oh no, it isn't. l've been all along there. l had to take exercise before they'd let me go out. And l went right round. Just quicker that way. Now you get back to bed or you'll catch cold. No l shan't. Your new here, aren't you? That's right. - l'll show you the way if you like. No l can manage. You get back into bed or you'll get me into trouble. All right, only you just go through there, it's the third block along. Yes sister. Okay. Er, your to go along to the main building and sister will meet you there. You see that door?. - Yes. Straight through and wait just inside until she comes. Okay. - Let us know if you identify her. l ... l'll ring you. Thanks a lot. Can l help you? Where you for? Operating theatre. Straight down the corridor, through the main hall, and on the left. Well good evening. Mr. Church, isn't it? Yes. - Then come along with me. Oh, yes of course, the coat. Nurse. - Yes, sister? Do you have to run? - No, sister. Then don't. - No, sister. Oh no, not another one. Well l hope they brought somebody else to do the anesthetic. l should have been off duty two hours ago. Emergency, l suppose. l think so, l was just told to bring her in here. Whose doing the op, do you know? Dr. Bright, l think. - Oh, just my luck. lf l hadn't stopped to fix this damn flanger, l should be in at home and in bed. Now l suppose l've got to stay and put her to byes byes. - They're after me. Both of them. l can't get away. l can't. Jay, stop them. Stop them Jay. Oh! - Talkative little thing, isn't she? Quick! Stop the man. l can't ... You'd better wait here for a moment. Nurse? Nurse! Oh. Oooh. Here, grab hold of this for a moment, will you? l wan't you to steady it while l get the nozzle free. No, not there. There. That's better. Now we're in business. What on earth happened to you? Oh, l don't know. l went down there l went to put the light on and someone grabbed me. Get me police. lf your looking for the lady, they've taken her away. Mr. Church, you souldn't be in here. l told you to wait outside. W ... Was this my wifes bed? - Yes, why? She isn't there. They've taken her away. - Nonsense. Who took her away? - Well ask her. lt was a man in a white coat. He pushed her on a trolley. - Was it Albert? No, it was a new man. l never saw him before. He wanted to go the wrong way. But l told him the operating place was that way. Sister, please come quickly, they want ... - Just a moment. Do you know anything about a patient in here being moved? No, sister. Unless she was the case for the operating theatre. They took one in just now. - Come along Mr. Church. And nurse l want a house surgeon immediately. Tell him l want him in the operating theatre, emergency. Yes, sister. - Oh, nurse. Yes, sister. - Run. Yes, sister. lt's no good. Look if Dr. Bright comes down, tell him l'll be back in a few minutes. l must get a new flanger. Jay! Don't let the catch me, Jay! Aaah! Aaah! Your to late. lt's all over. What do you mean? What have you done? l didn't want to kill anyone. l only wanted to go to New Zealand. That's all. Lucy! Jay. Oh, Jay! Take me home.
