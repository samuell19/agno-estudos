THE JUDGMENT Floris: Ada, you won't believe what I saw those fisherman do in Taprobane... Ada: Yes? Tell me, Floris! Floris: They used a flambeau and the craziest fish just jumped on board. Ada: Did you see sirens too, Floris? Floris: Oh yes and sea snakes and whales... Ada: Did you eat them too? Sindala: No, Ada, they wouldn't fit in his pan. Ada: Haha! But it was a great journey, Floris! Floris: Yes, and when I came back... They keep walking towards the fishing water when suddenly... Floris: Step back, Ada! ...a big tree falls right in front of them. Ada: Heavens! I got such a fright! Floris: Can't that wretched lumberjack be careful?! Where is he? Floris: I'll teach him a lesson! Ada: Floris! Please! While Ada follows Floris, the little girl bends over the picnic basket. Floris: I'll get that fellow! Ada: Floris, he'll have an axe and you only have a fishing rod! Linda: Mmm...! Cookies! Linda: Thank you! Floris: What? Ada: I was expecting a big lumberjack, but... Linda: Thank you! My daddy always wants me to say that! Ada: That's sweet. Here's another one. What's your name? Linda: Thank you. Linda. Douwe: Good girl, you said "Thank you"! Floris: Are you the lumberjack? We almost got that tree on our heads! Douwe: Is that all? Douwe: I'll drag it to the side. Linda: I want to go home. I'm hungry! Douwe: Let me remove the tree for the gentleman, then we can go home. Douwe: Anything else, mister? I'll work while you fish! Floris: What? I won't accept that! Ada: It's all solved, Floris. And did you move that tree on your own? Douwe: It's nothing. I started with Christmas trees and slowly grew into it. Douwe: Well, goodbye. Linda's hungry and so am I. Not much later, Floris, Ada and Sindala arrive at the fishing water. They swim straight into the pan here. Here's some bread. The coat of arms of Guelders. Silk. This belongs to an officer. Go! It's Barend Van Hakfort. Oldenstein! Villains! Let me introduce Barend Van Hakfort, Charles of Guelders' commander-in-chief. Ada, you go back to the castle. We have something to finish here. Be careful. I'm not done with you yet. Floris and Sindala start walking back with Barend Van Hakfort. Sindala: Ada didn't understand what you meant, Floris! Floris: But you did, Sindala! Floris: I'll fish with this prisoner as bait and catch Rozemondt Castle! Sindala: I hope you'll succeed, but you haven't got it yet! Charles of Guelders uses Rozemondt, Floris' inheritance, as a tollhouse. Duke Charles: If Philips of Burgundy will leave for Spain, we'll have free reign. Duke Charles: Who will be able to help us then? Captain: My Duke, in the south the French, in the north the Frisians... But Captain Van Rossem doesn't finish his sentence... ...an arrow lands in the map, right in front of him! Charles of Guelders and Van Rossem immediately drop to the ground. Captain: An attack! To arms! Duke Charles: Close the gate! They carefully look outside... ...but then they have to dodge a second arrow. Duke Charles: I saw them! Floris of Rozemondt with a prisoner! Captain: Yes... Barend Van Hakfort... Damn! Duke Charles: Talk to them, Van Rossem. I'll have them shot! Captain: Floris, release the Captain and I'll let you go just this once! Floris: Haha! You can get Van Hakfort back in exchange for my castle! Captain: Herman, shoot that man and don't let him see you! While Van Rossem negotiates with Floris about Rozemondt Castle... Floris: Barend Van Hakfort in exchange for the castle! Captain: Hm...! ...Charles' guard Herman gets his crossbow ready. But Sindala sees it. Sindala: Floris! Let's go! They're going to shoot! Sindala: I saw a crossbow. Van Rossem wants to kill you, Floris! Captain: Don't go. We accept! Duke Charles: Never mind, Van Rossem... Floris: Come to Averenduur the day after tomorrow, with the title to the castle. Floris: Then you'll get Barend Van Hakfort back... Floris: ...at the Mayor's! Bye! Guard: I can't hit them anymore... They're too far away... Duke Charles: Yes, you can go. Captain: We lost them. Captain: Why did that stupid Van Hakfort have to get caught by them? Duke Charles: Take it easy, Van Rossem! Duke Charles: Read my lips: I'll never give him this castle! Duke Charles: I want to keep this castle and I want Van Hakfort back. Arrange it! Captain: But it's not that easy, my Duke. Captain: It's in the hands of the Mayor of Averenduur. That town is powerful! Captain: And that Mayor's quick to take offence! Duke Charles: Offend him if you have to! On the agreed day, the Mayor of Averenduur enters Town Hall... Van Rossem enters Town Hall... ...where the Mayor takes control. Mayor: You have asked our impartial town councillors to act as mediators... Mayor: Well, Lord Van Hakfort, you are free... Mayor: Lord Van Rozemondt, here is your paper! Captain: Bring the paper to the toll house and it will be evacuated. Floris: Look, in writing and sealed... Finally, I have Rozemondt back! Mayor: The town of Averenduur guarantees that all agreements reached here... Mayor: ...are carried out. Mayor: Anybody who is within our walls is under protection of the town! Mayor: And now, to table! You'll all stay for dinner, won't you? Captain: Uhm... yes, please! Floris: It would be our pleasure! After a big meal, Floris and his friends go outside. Sergeant: Empty their pockets. It should look they were robbed. Sergeant: Let's go! Mayor: These are my guests. They'll pay for this. Mayor: I won't let them make a fool of me. The Mayor quickly brings Floris and Sindala to his house. Mayor: You were robbed, right? Where's your title to Rozemondt castle? Floris: I lost that too, of course. Mayor: That was their plan! They assaulted you in my town! Mayor: I won't let them get away with this! Captain: My Duke, the title to this castle! He didn't enjoy it for long! Duke Charles: Haha! Very good, Van Rossem! Then a servant comes in. Servant: A visitor, My Duke! The Mayor of Averenduur! Captain: Hmm... I'd better leave. Duke Charles: Yes, and take that piece of paper with you! The Mayor doesn't beat around the bush. Mayor: I think you were expecting me! Duke Charles: Why? Mayor: My Duke, a knight was assaulted and robbed in our town! Duke Charles: I see! You should organise better security at night! Mayor: Right, my Duke, it happened at night and the town guaranteed... Mayor: ...their safety. It seems they fled to Guelders. You benefit from this. Mayor: If you don't find the thieves... Duke Charles: Well? What then? Mayor: We're free citizens. We don't accept robbery. Mayor: Not from a Duke or from anyone. We want a judgment. Duke Charles: Haha! A couple of salmon smokers and bricklayers challenge me? Duke Charles: Me, Duke of Guelders? What are you thinking, fatty? I refuse! Mayor: Then no merchant from Guelders will be allowed into the town anymore. Duke Charles: Damn! Who says my servants are the thieves? Mayor: We don't know for sure. The town wants a judgment to decide who's right. Duke Charles: What, a judgment? Herman! Come here! Duke Charles: Herman's my champion, the best wrestler of Guelders. Bring it on! Mayor: In one week, on neutral ground! Duke Charles: Herman, in one week you'll fight the champion... Duke Charles: ...of a bunch of barley growers! Herman: I'm the greatest! After his visit to Charles of Guelders, the Mayor goes to Oldenstein... Guard: You wish to speak to Lord Walter? Come! ...where he explains his plans for the judgment. Mayor: We will send a message to our Lord, Philip the Handsome. Mayor: He'll want to be at the judgment. But who'll fight for us? -Can't I do it? No, we already have a champion. Who is it? -Douwe, the lumberjack. The one with the little girl? -Yes, let's go see him. I'll give you a doll for her. On the way to the lumberjack's cabin... Sindala: A doll for Linda and a bag of cookies... Ada did well, Floris! Douwe: Yes! Floris: Good evening, Douwe. Mayor: Good evening, Douwe. Douwe: Hello, Mayor. Sindala: Hello, Linda. Douwe: Say "Hello, Mayor". Linda: Hello, Mayor. Mayor: Hello, Linda. Mayor: Douwe, in 14 days, you're fighting Herman, the champion of Guelders. Mayor: It's a judgment. Douwe: Herman? I don't like that creep. Floris: Shall I do it then? Douwe: You fight Herman? He'll do this to you. Sindala: see what I have for you? Sindala: Here. Sindala: What do you say to that? Linda: Hello, Mayor. Mayor: Douwe, we all count on you, so practice well. Two weeks later the judgment takes place between Douwe and Herman... ...the champion of Guelders. Linda is kidnapped. If Douwe wants her back alive, he has to lose the fight. Floris and Sindala are able to save Linda at the last moment. Douwe wins after all and Floris gets his castle back. Ada: Finally, Floris! Floris: You can say that again!
