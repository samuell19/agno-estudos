My name is Alicia. I'm 40 years old. People expect me to cry all day, to be sad, not angry, to keep going. They tell me that time heals all wounds. Life goes on. Everything passes. Keep your chin up. So, this is it. It's 5,608 square feet. Why don't you take a look around, and we can go over the details later. Thank you. The bedrooms are over there. Have a look. - I call the big one. - No! Don't run! Kids, kids. It's all an act. I want to scream. I want to scream, but I can't make a sound. Looks like it's going to rain. I'm dead. I'm dead inside. I'm just going through the motions. Parking! Parking! You're in good hands! VIP parking spot? You're in good hands. Don't worry. - Where? - To the left. Come on. Come on. Good evening, boss. It's in good hands. - Thank you. - You can trust me. - Let me help you with that. - No, that's OK. - It's no bother. - No, please. Leave it alone. It's three bucks for the parking space. I live here. I'll give you one dollar. Here. It's three dollars. Who knows what might happen to your car otherwise? Are you threatening me? Just a warning. There's a difference. If something happens to my car, I'm blaming you. If somebody scratches it, steals something, or breaks a window, it's not my problem. That's the trouble with you gringos. - I'm not a gringa. - You're all the same. Boss! You forgot to lock your car! Let me do it for you! Throw me the keys! It's dirty. I'll wash it for you if you like. - I'll make it look nice and pretty. - No. Thank you. OK. Check it out, boss. Clean as a whistle. Clean enough to see your face in it. Don't you ever sleep? I can't sleep until the last customer leaves. - Look how clean it is now. - I told you not to wash it. Boss, just give me something. Look how clean it is. Just a little something. - How much? - Whatever you feel like. - How much? - Whatever your heart tells you. - How much do you charge? - Whatever. Go with your heart. Here. The minimum is five dollars. What's this? It's what I have. You're stingy... ...fucking gringa. Alicia. - Yes? - Jack's looking for you. Mom (Please, call me) Give me a minute. I'll be done in a second. How did it go with the penthouse? Fine. Did you close the deal? Not yet. I think they'll be making a deposit this week. You have to close the deal. Don't leave things up in the air. Just get the money. The money! What about the Italians? They loved it, but they're worried... Here are the contracts. ...about the families still living in there. What's this? From the clients you met with yesterday. How many families are we talking about? Four or five, but I really don't see how they're going to leave. I'll talk to González. We can fix that. Thank you. Well, I'll see you later. Hold on a second, Mexicana. Come here. Time for a drink. It's ten o'clock in the morning, Jack. Ten thirty by my watch. How are you doing? Fine. I'm fine. What's going on with the apartment? Have you moved in yet? Aren't you a little scared about living there on your own? No. Why? Well... You hear stories. So, everything's OK? Everything's OK. Cheers. Ma'am? I'm so sorry, but the señor called and says he's on his way here for lunch. Thank you, Edilma. I'm leaving now. Standing takedown. Grab them hard by the lapels. Posture! So, how are you doing? I'm fine. Awful. I mean, alright. I don't know. You need to go out, have a few drinks, clear your head. I don't want to clear my head. Fine. Don't clear your head. But let's go out and grab a couple of drinks tonight. Hey, gringa, it's three dollars. You know that. I'm not paying to park in front of my own house. I told you already, I'm no gringa. I don't care what you are. How am I going to get paid? This is my job. If you don't pay, who will? Your job? This is illegal. You want me to call the cops? Call whoever you want. No one can touch me. It's people like you who are ruining Panama. It's Lucas's turn. Come here! Parking spots! There's one right over there. Just three dollars. Parking! To me, he's a little... Compared to you he's a bit of a monk, isn't he? But we get along. We balance each other out. That's important. - What does he do? - Musician. I think this guy has his eye on you. Hello. - How are you? - Hi. How are you? Hi. I just waited a minute. I didn't step in right away because, I mean, how many times am I going to bail him out, drunk, in the middle of a fight? Cheers. Up, down, center, and down the hatch. Alicia! Where are you going? I'm going home. Come inside me. Come inside me. Come inside me. I'm coming. I'm coming. Come inside me. I'm coming. Stop. Stop. What's wrong with you? What's wrong? I'll call you an Uber, OK? Sorry. Whatever. Got any cigarettes? Thank you. Go to hell. My God. What happened? My God. Shit, shit, shit. Help me. Come here. Come here. Shit, shit, shit. Hold on to me. Take it easy. Get in. Lie down. Are you OK? Chief? Chief, just breathe. Wounded! Come on. Come with me. - What's the boy's name? - I don't know. One, two, three. Hang in there, kid. What happened to him? What's the boy's name? Ma'am! Ma'am, what's the boy's name? Ma'am! She came with the boy. Ma'am! Oh, my God. What happened? Shit! It's blood. What happened? Nothing. A friend of mine got hurt. Nothing serious. Sorry. Are you sure? Everything is fine. - My God. - Let's go. Thank you. I'll clean it up. Let us know if you need some help. Alicia. What are you doing? Nothing. I just came to pick up some things. I'm leaving now. I told you. You can't come here whenever you want. How are you? Not good. What about you? Not good. It doesn't look that way. You're playing golf again. Go to hell. What are you doing here? - Please, open the door. I'm begging you. - No, I can't. Open it, quick. - What are you doing here? - Please, open the door. What are you doing here? Why aren't you at the hospital? - I can't stay there. Open up, please. - Why can't you? - I had to get away. - Why? Because they arrest everyone with a gunshot wound. Open up, please. Listen, tell me where you live and I'll give you a ride home. I don't have a home. Open up, please. I'm begging you. - Are you carrying a gun? - No. If you're lying to me, I'll throw you back out without a second thought. No. - Raise your arms. - What? So now you're a cop? - I'm an architect. - What? Raise your arms, please. You mustn't talk to anyone while you're staying here. - I'm keeping this. - That thing is going to explode. I don't know what kind of trouble you're in and I don't care, but while you're in my house, you'll do what I tell you. Don't look out the window. You can't go out to the balcony. You can't answer the door, the telephone, or the intercom. Is that clear? Wait a second. I'll get you something for the pain. The anesthesia must have worn off by now. Hang on. Hang on. Let me see. Take this. Can you manage? Boss. Ready? Can I come in? Yes. Flush, please. Next time, lift up the toilet seat. Come here. Let's check that wound. Careful. Careful. It hurts. Let me see. My God. Careful. Looks like a 22 caliber. The doctors said I was lucky it wasn't a 9 millimeter. It would have pierced an organ. Well, I don't know anything about guns, but it might get infected. I need to take you back to the hospital. No. No way. Let me see. Let's take this off. So you're allergic to cops? How old are you? Thirteen. I'll be fourteen in December. Are you in a gang? No. What about those tattoos? Anyone can get a tattoo. That's normal. Careful. Take it easy. You think I'm an idiot, don't you? So, tell me. You were just minding your own business, and suddenly a gun went off? It was an accident. An incredible coincidence. You've seen me yourself. I take care of cars. Liar. I used to be in a gang, but I got out. How did you get out? You can't leave a gang just like that. Why not? People say all kinds of things. You can get out. This bandage needs to be tighter. This is the way I do it. If you don't like it, you can go to the hospital. You can be really mean, you know that? There you go. Let me see. Wait a minute. Who's Yulitza? She's my sister. Hold on. Why did you leave the gang? It was dangerous. Can you tell Jack that I'm not going to the office today? Please, cancel my appointments. No. It must be one of those twenty-four hour bugs. So, I'm a bug now? I appreciate it. Thank you. Bye. I won't steal anything. Don't worry. Why did you come here? I didn't have anywhere to go, and you seem like a good person. - Don't be a smartass. - I mean it. Well... I'm going out for a while. So you'll be on your own. Please, don't touch anything. Don't worry. I'll take good care of your house. Hey, boss, I took good care of your car. - It's three dollars. - Yes, I know. Thank you. A pleasure. I took good care of it. Hello? - Hello, doctor. This is Alicia. - How are you, Alicia? I'm prepping for surgery. This'll have to be quick. Yes. I'm sorry. Just a question. A kid in my neighborhood got shot, and I wanted to know how long it'll take him to recover. Well, if he was shot, you should call an ambulance. Stay out of it. No, no, he's already been to the hospital, and they've let him out. This is just a hypothetical question. Like, how long would it usually take him to recover? Is everything all right, Alicia? Are you in any trouble? No, doctor. Everything's fine. The truth is that this street kid showed up at my house. He'd just been shot. He ran away from the hospital. I had no choice but to help him. Where is he now? - He's in my house. - Listen to me carefully. Get that kid out of your house immediately. The younger they are, the more dangerous they are. Believe me. Promise me you'll get rid of him. Yes, of course. Are you crazy or what? What's wrong with you? Show some respect. You locked me in. So? Are you afraid I'm going to rob you? I always lock up when I leave. Force of habit. If there'd been a fire, I'd have had to jump off the balcony. But there was no fire. Don't move. What's that photo for? A friend of mine's a doctor. I want him to take a look. Not my face. I left your face out. Who shot you? I don't know. - How come you don't know? - I don't know. Didn't you see his face? No. It was dark, and it happened so quickly. It felt like I was on fire. Burning. Careful. Why were you shot? I don't know. - What kind of trouble are you in? - None. I used to be. What were you into? Everything. - What's "everything" mean? - You know. I don't. That's why I'm asking. I used to run errands. What? I'd deliver packages, or they'd put me on a corner to watch for the cops. What? Who made you do that? The bigger ones. Cops don't arrest kids, but they do arrest the older ones. Why did you leave? Because I had a friend called Dumb Face. He'd kill someone and then stand on a corner sucking his thumb like this. The cops would walk past him like he wasn't even there. He killed more than three people. And... They never asked you to kill anyone? Yes. That's why I got out and started taking care of cars. What happened to Dumb Face? They called him just Face. Now he's dead. The doctor says your wound looks fine. We just need to make sure it doesn't get infected. Thank you, boss. Don't call me "boss". My name's Alicia. Thank you, boss... Thank you, Alicia. - What's your name? - Alexis. Alexis? That's a lovely name, Alexis. We're done. Stop looking out the window. Sit down and have some dinner. Don't you have any normal food? What do you mean by "normal food"? What do you want? French fries, chicken, fried rice, rice with chicken. Hot dogs. Do you know what hot dogs are made of? No. You don't want to know. Do you want some butter on your bread? I can do it myself. Do you have kids? No. Who's that on your phone, then? His name was Lucas. He passed away a year and a half ago. He was six. I'm sorry. From Panama, this song is called "Galactic Panama". Doesn't that bore you? Actually, I find it quite relaxing. Do you want to try? Look. Add a little here. Just a little, a few dots. That's enough. Good hands. Why do you live alone in this big house? I got divorced. And it's not very big. When I have the money, I'm going to buy a big house just like this one. With a TV in every room, even in the bathroom. Why would you want a TV in the bathroom? And I'll live alone so no one can mess with me. Do you like jazz? No. What kind of music do you like? Reggae. Reggaeton. Reggae. What's the difference? One's "reggae", and the other's "reggaeton". Here. I'll play something for you. Listen. That's reggaeton. And that's how you dance to it? Show me your moves, gringa. Come on. Don't move your shoulders, just your head. The point is he escaped from the hospital and he's now at my house. That's why. Well... OK, I'll call you later. Storm's comin'. - What? - It's going to rain. Allow me. Dry yourself properly and put this on. You're looking better. I think you'll be able to leave tomorrow, OK? - I'll give you forty dollars and your phone. - I don't need your money. I need to talk to you. About what? It's... I'm in trouble with my family. You told me that you didn't have a family. I need to talk to you, I need to tell you the truth. It's just that my sister is pregnant. Pregnant at fifteen, just like my mother. My mother got mad as hell and smashed her in the face with a bottle. So I had to drop out of school, and find a job to help her, to take care of her. - I see. And where's your father? - He's in jail. Now my mother's with a real piece of shit. He doesn't give you any help? He's the real problem. He's a cop. Stop bullshitting me, Chief, please. - You don't believe me? - No. It doesn't matter if I believe you or not. The important thing is that you're OK now and you can leave tomorrow. So I'll leave. If you see me in the street, don't even think of trying to talk to me. We're not friends anymore. We're enemies. Take it easy, will you? If I get killed, it'll be your fault. What do you want me to do? What can I do? Nobody's going to save you. Nobody's going to save me. We're on our own. That's it. I'm outta here. Where are you going? I'm leaving. Like you said, we all need to take care of ourselves. Not now. It's late and it's raining. You'll get sick. Stay here. I'll make you some tea. You're coming down with a cold. - I don't like that stuff. - You'll stay and drink your tea! Can I have some rum? No. Just a taste. You're too young. I've had stronger stuff. Really? OK. Just a sip. That's enough! It tastes funny when it's warm. What? Remember that crazy face you had when you tried to open the door? You were going to break the door down. Crazy face... Why didn't you tell me you could break in whenever you wanted? You didn't ask me. You fool. People don't say "fool" much around here, do they? What do they say instead? Moron. Yes, that's right. Isn't there a nicer word? Idiot? How did your son die? Was he sick? No. It was an accident. A freak event. One of those things... We were at a birthday party for my friend Perla's son. I took Lucas. I was sitting there, talking and having some drinks with my friends. Lucas was playing around with his friends. There was a playground about thirty feet away. And I saw him climbing on a swing. Suddenly, he fell. And he didn't get back up. I was sitting, watching him. He wouldn't get up. He wouldn't get up. About ten or twenty seconds later, I don't remember exactly... I got up, and started walking towards him, I sensed something... Something was wrong. But I didn't run. I just walked. When I got closer, I saw his face. He wanted to say something to me, but he couldn't. He'd fallen into a puddle. Next to it was a socket and some loose wires. Some idiot didn't do their job. When I grabbed him, I felt the shock. He was getting electrocuted. I held him, but he couldn't move. He was stiff. The last thing he said was: "My whole body hurts, mommy." The doctor said his heart stopped pumping blood. His father says I killed him. Do you think I killed him? Then he wanted us to have another child... to kind of... I don't know. I don't know why I'm telling you all this. - Good night, Alexis. - Good night. Turn off the lights, please. Good morning, boss. You're late for work. Try it. Let's see. Good? You learn fast. Boss, is this Lucas? Yes. How old was he in this picture? He was six. Who's this? Lucas's father. Your husband? My ex-husband. Look. This is the one I told you about. Chief. Don't do that. You're going to hurt yourself. I'll be fine. Stop it. It's not good for you. - I'm fine. - Just stop it, please. You'll hurt yourself. Chief. Stop it! Just wait a minute. Let me show you something. Stop it. Let's put that away. Just let me show you something. Wait. Step back. Just step back, please. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten... Catch! No! I didn't mean it. It was an accident. Now you're bleeding. Careful. Let's check it out. Yes, yes. No. Just tell him I'm on my way. OK, I'll hurry. Bye. You were a good mother, weren't you? Apparently not good enough. I'll be back soon. - Boss! Boss! - What is it? - Could you do me a favor? - What? Can you bring me a pizza, please? I'll make you one when I get back. It's healthier. No, I want a real one from the pizza place, and a soda, please. We'll see. OK. Thank you. The thing about this place is that there is no competition. You have a fucking island in the middle of town. Nobody has that. You don't have to go around talking about square footage. This is about lifestyle. This is the sales pitch: A house on an island. That's what you're going to sell. Alright? Barefoot Elegance. - Finally. - I'm sorry. You're late. What happened? I'm sorry. I'll tell you later. Sorry. - Apologies. Good morning. - Good morning. Alicia's our top salesperson. - It's good to meet you. - A pleasure. So, you're selling a lifestyle. You come home with a drink in your hand, with your family, or mistress, or whoever. You have a yacht docked outside. You have a marina. How many slips are there? As many as they want. What do you mean by that? How many slips are there? We can put in as many as they want. Seems like one hundred, two hundred. I think there's around 250 slips. A yacht in front of every house. That's what you have to sell. Barefoot Elegance is a concept that transcends Boho Chic... What's so funny? Are you jealous because it's not your design? Alicia's a little jealous because she's an architect. She wanted to present her design, but we didn't let her. And now she has to sell this one. Go to hell. Sorry? Go to hell! Watch your fucking mouth. Asshole. Where are you going? Where are you going? Good afternoon, boss. I've seen many beautiful women in my life, but you're the prettiest. - With all due respect. It's three bucks. - Thank you. Let me see. No worries, sweetheart. Have a nice day. - Take care. - Thank you. Chief! Chief! Fucking hell. Thank you. How may I help you? - Do you know where Chief is? - Who's Chief? The boy who always works here. He hasn't been around for a while. I haven't seen him for a while, boss. - Do you know where I can find him? - Why are you looking for him? That's not important. Do you know where I can find him? Yes. But what's it worth to you? I'll give you twenty dollars. Ten if you take me there, and ten if I find him. OK. Fine. Just a minute. "Mute", come here. Come here. She wants to know where Chief lives. Let's take her there. Chief, the little one. Let's take her. - What? - He's coming with us. He's the one who knows where Chief lives. Trust me. I'll get you there. Go straight ahead. - This way? - Go straight. - Right here? - Straight on. Pull over here. Right here? Yes. We can't go any further. There's a war going on. This is as far as we can go. - What do you mean there's a war? - It's a war. That's not our turf. Wait, wait. Which house is his? See that green building, second floor, red door. If he's not there, you'll find him at the morgue. He's tame. Don't worry. He won't bite. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. What's up? I'm looking for Alexis. Does he live here? Who are you? I'm a friend of his. He looks after my car. What do you want with my son? - Nothing. I just want to know... - Does he sell you drugs? I just want to see if he's OK. Have you seen him recently? Where are you from? You speak funny. - I'm from Mexico. - You're Mexican. - Do you know where he might be? - I don't know where he is. OK. I'm sorry. Who's that woman? She's just doing a survey. She's just leaving. I'm sick of this shit, I've had enough. Miss. Miss. Meet me early tomorrow at the Cathedral. I have to tell you something. Get the hell away from her! Stop talking shit. She's telling you to move away, but you won't listen! I told you to stay away from the fucking door! Don't be talking to anyone! You always protect your man but not us! Neither me nor my brother! Don't be a little fucking snitch! Don't you respect your mother? Don't raise your voice to me! Stop telling me off! Come in. This way. Take your time. It was all very strange. I don't even know how he got me to trust him. How much did he take? Two hundred fifty in cash. It's strange. He left a pair of expensive watches behind, and a gold necklace in the same drawer. But two fifty is enough to buy a gun. I went to his home in El Chorrillo looking for him. Are you crazy? What were you thinking? You let him in your house, and now you've gone to his? I'm worried. I should have listened to him. Now I can't get him out of my head. Forget about that crook. He's a kid. I need to know why he left like that. You have to accept that nothing is going to bring your son back. Forget it. Forget about him. Stop! Stop! Stop! Let her go! What the hell is wrong with you? Parking spots! It's in good hands! Chief! Chief! What? I'm afraid. I'm afraid about my brother getting killed. Do you know who shot him? He was shot because he wants to protect me. He threatened to kill the guy who got me pregnant. I don't understand. Who's the father of your child? Yulitza, if you don't tell me the truth, I can't help you. My stepfather. You can't live at home anymore. You need to go somewhere safe. I'll stay with my aunt. Good. As long as you're well. Don't worry about Chief. I'll find him. Why do you call my brother "Chief"? That's what they call him, right? They call him "Dumb Face", but he doesn't like it. So they call him "Face". You have to promise me you'll take care of my brother, if my stepfather doesn't kill him first. I can't promise you anything. Enjoy your meal. Good afternoon. Can I take your order? Do you have water? No. I just have hamburgers, hot dogs, soda and chicha. Give me a chicha. Here you go. - Thank you. - You're very welcome. Good afternoon. - What's wrong? - You can't come in. You first have to check in at the lobby. I don't have to do that. Please, open the gate. Those are your husband's orders. Sorry? Those are your husband's orders. He says you have to check in at the lobby. You know me very well. Can you let me in, please? Yes. I know you, ma'am. I know you very well, but those are your husband's orders. - Do I have to check in now? - Yes. I have to announce you're here. Hello? Mrs. Alicia is here. You can go up. - Hello, ma'am. - Hi, Edilma. Is Diego at home? The señor is in his bedroom. I'll get him for you. I'm turning it into a study. I couldn't even pass by the door. I brought you the keys. What happened to you? Nothing. It happened during training. It was all too perfect. Goodbye, Diego. What are you doing here? Get out of my way. - Give me that weapon. - Get out of my way. Give it to me. Alexis. Face! You're not alone. Let's get out of here. Come on. - You came looking for more? - No! Put it down! Put it down! He's just a kid! This criminal fuck dies tonight. - Stay away from her, you pussy! - You want a bullet, too? - Who's gonna save you now? - Run, Chief! - Who's gonna save you? - Run! Fernando Xavier De Casta, the actor who played "Chief", was murdered months before the film's release. In Latin America, children and teenagers die every day, victims of senseless violence. We dedicate Plaza Catedral to their memory and shattered dreams.
