May I stretch for a sec? Yes, sure. Let's take a break! - Hello? - Hello, is this Atty. Ramos? Who's this? This is from the Mandaluyong Police Station. We apprehended your son after a bar fight. What? May we invite you to come to the police station? Alright, I'll be there. Hello, honey! I was told Charles got arrested. He got into a fight at a bar. I can't leave. I'm finishing something. Okay. I'll go there alone. Charles? Charles! Are you okay? What happened? Atty. Ramos! Yes. I'm his mother. What happened? We didn't know he's your son. We caught him in a brawl here in Mandaluyong. There's big damage at the bar. The owner is complaining about the 100 thousand pesos damage. What?! 100 thousand pesos? Alright. We will settle with the owner and pay for the damages. Can you please start with the processing right away? Charles? Charles, can we talk, please? Charles! We need to talk about this! What?! This is getting out of hand. First, the failed grades. And now, getting into bar fights? What is happening to you? Please talk to me! Mom, can you please go ahead? I won't leave until you come with me! Get in the car! Charles! What happened? Nothing, Dad. It's just a fight. That guy at the bar is an asshole! He disrespected the girl I was with. Are you alright? Were you hurt? I'm alright. You should've seen his face! Don't do that again. Your mother is worried sick. Really? She got worried? Don't talk like that. She's your mother. I'll go upstairs. Okay. Oscar, he's getting worse! I just fetched him from a precinct! Hon, he's just a teenager. Just talk to him. He won't talk to me and he barely looks at me. You're the only one he talks to. Alright, I'll talk him out of it. Is your friend still in your studio? It's getting late! Not anymore? She already left. Oh? You're still not going to bed? I'll sleep in the studio. Good night. Do you have an appointment? I'll inform Atty. Atty. Ramos, your 2 PM is here. It's your new client, Olivia Fuentes. Let her in. Okay, Ma'am. You may come in. Mrs. Fuentes, please. Good afternoon, Atty. Ramos. Good afternoon, Mrs. Fuentes. What can I do for you? I want to file a case against my husband. On what grounds? He has a mistress. Have you worked with another lawyer before on this specific matter? None yet. Alright. Could you walk me through your case just to get a general picture? Her name is Beth. A former escort girl. He took her in and even bought a condo in Quezon City. This is their photo together. We will work through it. But, I will need more evidence from you. Like credit card charges, proof of the condo? and anything that could prove she's the mistress of your husband. We will set up another meeting. You could call Gwen when you're ready to set up an appointment. Will that be okay? Alright. Rest assured that I will help you with your case. Attorney, you and your husband have that dinner with the Castros tonight. Just a reminder. Oh, yeah. I almost forgot. Gwen, thanks for reminding me. - No problem. - Thank you. Hello, hon? We have a dinner meeting tonight with the Castros. Should I just meet you at the restaurant? I'm sorry, I can't come. What? Hon, why? We have planned for this. You know that I am finishing a piece. I have a deadline. Oh my god, sorry! Who's that? Is someone there? No one. I'm alone here. Just tell Aira and Ryan that I'll make it up with them. I'm really sorry! No, it's okay. I think I know her. Is she that popular lawyer? Yeah. I'm right. She's Atty. Ramos. Do you know her? She's my wife. So you're the husband who's an artist! I forgot I had something to do. Maybe next time? Are you sure? Okay. Aira. Ryan. Sorry, I'm late. Got stuck with work. That's okay, sis. We just arrived. Where's Oscar? He's not with you? He can't come. He needs to finish something for his exhibit. Having an artist for a husband is not easy, right? Your friend is like that sometimes. There are days she's hard to find. That's how being in the zone works. Knowing Aira, she's really like that when she's passionate at work. I remember back in high school, she's the last to submit a project. She was dedicated to making it good! Well, I'm sorry for being passionate. It's too bad we can't have Oscar today. In college, he's also the slowest to do projects. When is his exhibit? By the end of this month. It's near! Yeah. He sleeps in his studio now. He's agitated! What is he working on? A series of portraits of women. He's been working with a lot of female models recently. Interesting theme. Knowing that he has this strong and influential woman as his wife. That's actually nice. Don't you get jealous? To tell you the truth, sometimes I do. That's fine. You can't help it! As an artist, I know that Oscar sees no malice in it. What's so funny? I'm sorry. I just didn't see you as the jealous type. Why, hon? With all the work that she's been doing, I doubt she even notices her husband working all the time. Well, I do notice it. I'm workaholic but it doesn't mean I don't care about my family. I didn't say that you don't care. I said, you might not notice things? You might not be noticing a lot of things. Knowing you? You spend your every waking time buried in your job. What do you mean? It's why Oscar is like that. Did he tell you something? No. You know, men are designed to be the provider for their family. That's innate in us. Our pride comes in. Imagine how Oscar feels about your situation. Maybe that's the reason why he keeps burying himself in his job. Excuse me? So next is, women belong inside the houses and should just be plain housewives? Is that what you're saying? It's not like that. I get it. It's the 21st century. Women can work. Etcetera. Still, your main job is to take care of the family. Your spouse and everyone else. If I were you, let your man be the provider and you be the nurturer. That's in your favor. You would sit pretty in the house. Wow! You, men, want blind compliance from us just because we married you? You're not looking for a partner but an assistant. If this is how he treats you, Aira? I say, file for annulment and I'll gladly help you with that. Hey, you're overstepping! I'm overstepping? You're the one who told me to quit my job just to make my husband feel good about himself. Many women stoop down just to cater the ego of men like you. I'm way different. I won't submit myself to men who are too proud? Men who bring women down just because they're afraid of what we can attain and do. I will never listen, or follow men like you. Why did you say that? So what? What I said is the truth. Your friend might be on menopause. She's overreacting! Excuse me. Hi. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to stare. It's okay. I like your lipstick. Thank you. My boyfriend likes it too. That's why I use it all the time. I'm Beth, by the way. Rowena. You're really beautiful, did you know that? Stop joking. - I'm not. - An old woman like me? Come on. Come on. I'm not joking. I'm serious! You don't look old at all. Would you mind if I ask? how young are you? I am 45 years old. 45? You don't look old. I hope I'll look the same when I reach that age. I'll go ahead. Bye. Dad! Son. You're here. Dad, I'll go out with my friends. I don't have a car. Why don't you use yours? Mom confiscated my key. We can't do anything about that. Ask her. Dad, please? Tell your mother. She'll get mad at us. She won't let me. That's why I came to you. She'll get mad at me also. Dad, please. Mommy's not the only one to decide. Fine, use mine. Really? Thanks, Dad. Take care. Good thing they lent you the car. Your mother forbade you, right? Don't mind her. I asked my dad, and he let me borrow his car. Looks cool, isn't it? Your fight with your mom isn't done yet? There's no such fight. We're just not on speaking terms. Everything I do is wrong for her. Aside from me being always wrong, She's also too controlling as if everything needs her approval. She used to be like that with dad. Isn't that normal? My mom notices my actions too. As for my mom, she's cool with the things I do. She doesn't care about what I do. Mom used to be like that. She was always busy at work so she didn't mind me. Until such time that she and Dad went on the rocks. Isn't she just making it up with you? Making it up how? You said she was always busy. She might be guilty by now. It's too late! She doesn't have to be a mother to me. Why does your dad have a problem with your mom? She doesn't look her age! You know, man... If somebody controls me like that, it's fine as long as she's hot! Fuck, what did you say? Stop it! Bro, chill! - Asshole! - I'm just saying your mom is hot. Something wrong? If your dad doesn't want her? I'd be happy to tap in! Damn you! Asshole! - Fuck you! - Fuck you too! Pervert! Fuck, just go home! - Fool! - I'll tell your mother! This is you! Yes, son? Hello, Dad? Could you fetch me? I got into a fight. The bar won't let me go. What? Where are you? What happened? Are you okay? Please fetch me, Dad. I'm in Kalayaan Avenue. I'll go to you. You slept late? Yes. Where did you go last night? Last night? I did not leave. I saw you left using the other car. I left? I did not. You might be dreaming? Thanks. Is Charles awake? He left early. That's a surprise! He woke up early? Yes, Ma'am, he was in a hurry. Why? Do you know where he went? I don't. Maybe he went to his school? Don't mind him. Eat up. Yes, Attorney? Gwen. Where is it? I'm still looking into it. There's just a problem with the information you gave. What problem? There's a lot of matches with that name. I'm going through them one by one. Is there any other info to filter it? Mother's name, perhaps? I told you to work with what I gave you. I don't have any other info! Sorry, Attorney. Copy. Attorney, let me remind you of your appointment today with Mrs. Fuentes. She called in earlier. She's on her way. Alright. Please expedite what I'm asking you to find. Yes, Attorney. So handsome! I want the painter! Hold a workshop class, idol! Can we apply as a model? Let's go! Atty. Ramos, Mrs. Fuentes is here. - Let her in. - Okay, Ma'am. Please come inside. Mrs. Fuentes, please have a seat. How are you? My husband continues to cheat on me, if that's what you are asking. I have further proof. How were you able to obtain these photos? Is that important? Of course. I am your lawyer. I should be ready if they have something against us. I hired a private investigator. Alright, I need to ask some questions so we can start some process. Remember, I'm your lawyer. Any statement that you will give- all of it!-will stay confidential. Just between us under the attorney-client privilege. I won't divulge any information outside the legal team without your consent, nor can I force you to. Do you know exactly when the affair started? Last year, around March, when I first caught him talking to a woman. He said she was introduced by a friend when they went out for a drink. The woman approached him. I discovered that they were hiring escorts. He met Beth through a pimp. His friend said it was my husband's idea to hire escorts. How often do they meet in a week? Four times a week. He goes to her condo before going to work and before going home to me. I think that's all we need to know. I'll call you for additional information. Do the same, if you have any other information to tell me. Thank you, Attorney. No worries. Gwen will escort you out. Ma'am. Mrs. Fuentes? Excuse me? Who are you? Come on. Don't mind her. Charles! I already asked Dad. Hold on. Your mother looks angry. She's scary! Don't worry. She's always angry. I told Dad that I have someone here. Sorry, did I scare you? Excuse me. Can I have one mojito, please? Thank you. You know what? I don't do this anymore. Somebody took me home already. Then why did you still come to see me? Curious, I guess? Thank you. Curious about what? You. Why is that? Is it your first time to have a client like me? No. I had a lot of powerful women being secretly gay as my clients. Here in our country, women have high standards. I'm curious about you. Me? Why? You don't remember? You were that woman in the restroom. At the restaurant. Let's talk shop, shall we? The reason why I called you is because? I want you to seduce my husband. Seriously? Wow. Okay. That's a first. Do you usually choose his woman for him? I want you to present yourself to him, then see if he'll take the bait. Alright. I'm fed up with thinking if he has a mistress, or he's gaslighting for feeling bad for all of this, and for doubting my sanity for all the things that I'm seeing. At least, through you, I can confirm my suspicions. I want you to report everything to me. Okay? So? How will I meet him? There's this speakeasy he frequents every Thursday. They seldom meet now. I suppose his mistress left him, since he now comes home cranky and drunk. I will proceed with the case. Attorney? Attorney? I'm sorry. You were saying? I will still proceed with the case. Are you alright? Sorry. I must be exhausted. It won't happen again. It's okay. Being a matriarch should be hard. Me? Matriarch? I don't see myself that way. My husband is my partner. We do things together. We decide together. We see each other as our equal. Don't you hear the rumors? Rumors? What rumors? People look at you as the head of the family. Assertive. Influential. Iron lady of the court. Meanwhile, your husband takes painting for a hobby. Mrs. Fuentes, my husband isn't like that. He's good at his work. And he's quite known in his field. Unlike you. Everybody looks up to you and respects you. You help a lot of people and I'm one of them. Charles. What's on your face? Is that a bruise? Where did you get that? It's nothing. Don't mind it. Don't mind it? What really happened? You make a big deal out of it! It's a big deal, Charles! Charles! Please come back here. Charles! Oscar, do you know where Charles got his bruise? That one? Don't worry. The doctor checked it and it's minor. What? You knew about it and you didn't tell me? Let it go. He wished not to let you know. Not to let me know? I'm his mother. You're his father! Yet you tolerate such behavior. - Oscar, where did the bruise come from? - He got into a bar fight. Okay? - What? - Happy now? Why didn't anyone tell me? You're even covering him up. Because that's how you'll react! Besides, you're busy at work. You won't notice that! We're talking about my son here. Of course, I will notice it! I will react however I want because I am the mother! Why does it seem like it's my fault to feel this? Don't you dare bring my work into this. You know that has nothing to do with it. It has everything to do with it. You know deep inside. Have you ever thought that I'm trying here to balance my life and my work? Why put all the blame on me? I'm giving you the best life so why is it my fault? Oscar. Oscar! Hi! Sorry, am I late? No, you're not. Did you meet my husband? I've actually been thinking? This is a mistake. And I'm dragging you into this. I should be dealing with our problem myself. I did it. What? Your order. I met up with him and presented myself. I did what you asked. What happened? I made a scene, like you told me, for him to notice me. I pretended that I broke my heel, sprained my ankle, and he assisted me. He wondered why I was alone. Where's your table? Are you with someone? Actually, no. I'm alone. Then I told him that I was supposed to meet up with a female friend but, it got canceled at the last minute. If that's the case, do you mind joining me for a drink? You need a helping hand. Sure, why not? I asked him about his work. He said he's an artist. He's working on something for his exhibit. And then, I asked about his family. He said he's single. My gosh, are you okay? I'm sorry. Don't mind this. Go on. What else did my good husband do? He held my legs and? Did he make a move on you? He got closer to my face? slowly. Hold on. Tell me this, did you kiss him back? We started making out. He inserted his hand in my skirt seeking my skin. Do you want me to stop? Will you meet again? Did he ask you out? Yes. The next day, same time, same place. How about this? I will allow you to keep seeing my husband, but you have to report everything to me. One more thing, you can't ever sleep with him. He might be puzzled if I don't have sex with him. It's your job to come up with something just so you won't sleep with him. Are you waiting for someone, Ma'am? I am. Is that a date? We'll see. I'm sorry, I'm late. No, it's okay. Is the traffic bad? Nah. I just finished something. Artwork? You know... It's that I'm quite inspired that we're meeting. You know what? Why not just make me one of your models? Better inspiration, I guess? I'm sorry I'm late. It's okay. We can call it quits. I'm sorry? I was late last time, right? Anyway, have you eaten? Do you want to order? No, it's okay. I need to get back to work soon. So what's new? Well, I asked him if I could model for one of his pieces. What's his response? He agreed. On one condition. What? That we go elsewhere other than his studio. Why not? Under repair? It's not fixed yet? Wow! Amazing! He got sick of fucking his girls in my own house that he needs to go out. How strange! You mean, he always brings his girls to his studio? Ever since he started working on that exhibit. Perhaps he came up with that idea so it could be effortless to end up with his girls. It won't be obvious that he screws them right there and then in his fucking studio! That's why I hired you, right? To confirm if he's really cheating on me. Now I know. I'm okay. Thank you. Well? he did tell me something. He wants to keep seeing me. He said I'm not like any other girl he had. Fine? It's better having you see him than letting some other sluts sleep with him. At least, I control your actions. But you must remember our deal. You can't have sex with my husband. Is it clear? Hi. Hi! Are you alone? Yeah, I'm alone. That pretty face shouldn't be left alone. Wow! What a line. I've been hanging out here all by myself. Can't a girl just drink alone at a bar? She can but she's better off with a guy. You know? to protect you! - Protect from what? - From guys with ulterior motives. Why? Aren't you that type of guy? I can confidently say that I have good motives. I'm just concerned! You're funny. Beth Delos Reyes, by the way. Charles Ramos. Ramos? As in the famous Atty. Ramos? Unfortunately, yes. She is my mother. Wow! I'm a big fan of your mom. You're one of many. You don't seem happy. Don't mind me. Well, Charles Ramos, I actually have to be somewhere. How about I give you my number and you can protect me some other time? Sure! Call me, okay? - Thank you. - Bye. I told you I'd get her! You can't relax! - I thought you lost your magic. - Nah! We thought you changed. Excuse me? Can I help you? Yes, I'm looking for Rowena Ramos. Atty. Ramos? May I ask your name, please. Just tell her that Beth is here. - Are you her new client? - No. I'm her friend. Okay? Excuse me for a minute, I'll just inform Atty. Ramos. I told you I'm her friend. Could you just let me in? I'm sorry but we have protocols. I really need to tell her first before I can let you come in. Atty. Ramos? Someone named Beth is looking for you. She said she's your friend. Beth? What is she doing here? Should I let her in? Let her in. Have a seat. What are you doing here? Next time, don't come unannounced. What if my secretary recognized you? Why? Can't I pay for a visit? Not in my place of work. Tell me. Why are you really here? What is this? Why are you giving me this? I remember the first time we met, you said you like my lipstick? So I bought you one. We have the same now. Thank you, but you didn't have to. I know. I just want to give you something that you want. Thank you, but could you please go? Someone might see you here. Why are you in a hurry? Because I'm being unethical by hiring someone for my own personal gain. It's a conflict of interest for my client. What do you mean? Forget it! - Please. - Wait a sec. How about Oscar? Why? He's wondering now. He's being impatient with me. About what? You know what. I no longer have an excuse. You mean you had sex with him? I had to! I had no choice. I told you never to have sex with him. It's a simple instruction. If I don't give him what he wants, then he'll stop seeing me. And if he stops seeing me, you'll lose control over him. Do you want him to meet with one woman after another? And God knows what the fuck they'll do! You know what? Why not just tell him the truth? Then the three of us could have sex afterwards. What? You know? to spice things up. It could be the saving grace of your marriage. You are already overstepping. I no longer need your services. I'll send your last payment first thing tomorrow. - But I was just- - Just leave! Now. Please! You called, Atty? Gwen, could you please escort her outside? - Right away. - Thank you. Let's go, Ma'am? Hello, Ma'am? Yes, Gwen? Regarding your task. Any news? I think I found it. I just need confirmation. I will give the result at the end of the week. Thank you. The earlier, the better. You have an appointment? Appointment? We're going to the art exhibit, aren't we? Did you forget? We need to be there. Several art critics will attend. Sorry, I forgot. Do I really need to be there? Perhaps I can pass on this one? You can't. We need to be seen together. I'll be done in a few minutes. See you downstairs. Hi! How are you? - Can we take a picture? - Yeah, sure! Hey, sis! Aira! Gosh, good thing you're here. I can see how bad you stare at those girls near Oscar. I just hate it. I really hate it. How can he possibly flirt with girls when I'm here? Am I that low for him? Don't think that way. Then what? Why does he keep on flirting with other girls? Why does he treat me like I'm nothing? Is it because I'm old that he's fooling around? Fooling around? Is he cheating on you? Hello, Aira! - Good to see you. - Hi! Nice to see you too, Oscar! We missed you at our dinner. I'm sorry. I was busy. It's good you came today. I'm about to finish with my work. I still have time to spare. Great to hear that! I'm so excited to see your artwork. Thank you! Let me steal your friend. Excuse us. Where are we going? You need to meet the other clients. They want to meet you. I'm not part of this exhibit. Why do I have to talk to them? We need to build a network. Please? Something's odd. What do you mean? You look different. Maybe it's my new lipstick. I like it. It suits you. Look at this. Isn't it pretty? Hello? Where are you? Are you drunk? How does he do it? What? How did he touch you? How did he kiss you? Was that your first time? First what? With a woman. Why do you ask? I don't think it's your first time. How could you tell? I just know. I've encountered every kind of client. So? Is it? Does it matter? I just wanna know. No. I had a female lover during law school. What happened? It was then discreet unlike nowadays. Is it the reason why you no longer love your husband? Who told you I don't love my husband? I wouldn't act this way if I don't love him. Will I see you again? I don't know. I need to go. You're here. Sorry. You disappeared earlier. Something came up at work. I needed to go. Work at this late? What about you? Why question me when... I don't say anything when you work here with different women at the wee hours? I'm not the issue here. So I'm the issue again? I'm always the problem, am I not? I?m tired. I don't have the time and the energy to argue. There. You're good at avoiding an argument. What for? So you could show that you're always right? That I'm lacking, that I'm wrong? To step on my manhood and prove that you're the one providing for this family? What are you talking about? I'm right! This is the reality. Every time we argue, every time we talk? Right? Even if you're at fault, you always throw it at me. That's why I lock myself here in the studio, so I can pour myself into my work. Why? Isn't it true? You keep on attacking me for being a workaholic? When I'm just doing everything that I can to give this family a better life. Can these artworks provide for us? Do I like the idea that my own son doesn't talk to me? That my husband cheats on me behind my back? There you go! It came from your own mouth. You see me that low. Fuck it, Rowena! I admit? I cheated on you. It's because I got tired of being your husband. I got tired behind your shadow. You're respected! People look up to you. Everyone. Unlike me. I'm this low. I'm just an artist. Even you look down on me. I'm so tired. I'm so tired running after you. Why do you keep on treating me as a competition? We're husband and wife, we're not competitors. Why measure who's the one doing more? Or who's the one being looked up to? You are my husband! You are supposed to be happy for me and my achievements. But everything is about your ego! I won't stoop that low for your pride. I can't let go of my pride. That's all I have. You took everything else already! Fuck that pride! Could that feed you? Could that fend for your family? Do you think I'm not hurting too? I get tired too! The need to always be seen as strong? as someone who holds her shit together. If I show just one ounce of weakness, people will use it against me. Everything I built, they will destroy! Oscar? You were the one person whom I was counting on to be there for me? To support me despite all my weariness. Even when I get tired of concealing my weakness, you were always there to catch me. But ever since Charles was born, you became distant. You made me feel so unattractive, so unwanted. Maybe it's why you opt to be with girls who are much younger, much beautiful. I choose to be presentable, to look pleasing to other people, to always seem strong, even if deep inside I'm very drained. Because I know... Otherwise you would leave me like the others. I married you not because of your looks. I gave up a baby? before we were even together. I was afraid to tell you. I'm sorry. Excuse me. You can't come in. What do you think you're doing? - I'm sorry, you're banned from entering. - Are you kidding me? I'm a friend of your boss. - Atty. Ramos banned you- - I don't believe you! You're making up stories, bitch! Will you stop making a scene? She's not here. She just left. When will she come back? I don't know. Fine. I'll wait for her. Okay. Excuse me. Tastes good. Thank you. It's good, huh? Where's Jun? Wait a sec. Jun? Guard! Did you see Jun? - He went outside. - Call him, please. Thanks. Charles, let's eat! Charles, eat first. Thanks, Dad. I'll just go upstairs. Alright. Dig in. Hello? Hey! Do you remember me? Of course! Why didn't you call? Sorry, I forgot. Why did you call? Are you busy? Not at all. Why? Let's hang out. I want the protection you were offering. Sure. Tell me where. Wait! Don't you want to? It's not like that. Are you a virgin? No. Just not here. Why? I don't like being in public. - Let's go to the restroom. - No! - How about in my car? - I don't want to! Any comfortable place? Let's check in. I'm not cheap! Then where do you want to go? How about in your place? My parents are there. It would be a problem. How about my place? I'm thirsty. Do you want water? Sure. Have some water. You're so parched! Thank you. Good thing you're free tonight. I'm always free. Aren't your parents looking for you? No. No one cares for me at home. Especially now that my parents are on good terms. Come a few weeks, they will bicker again. Do they always fight? I guess? They're both passive-aggressive. They're not loud. But they treat each other badly. They're on good terms, then suddenly, they're angry at each other. My mom would direct her angst to me! Their system knocks me out. - Beth? - Yes? Hon, who's calling you at this hour? Hon? Who's that? Oscar. It's Charles. What happened? Hello? There! You answered. Beth? Wow! You still know my voice. I thought you completely forgot about me. Beth, this is not funny. What did you do to our son? "Our son?" So it's true that you made amends with Oscar? Beth, don't bring our son into this. No worries. He's safe here with me. I just wanted to get your attention. You got my attention. Now, please let our son go. Then what? You won't talk to me again? You will throw me away as if nothing happened? If you still want to see your son, go fetch him yourself. I better not see any police standing outside my window. I'll send you the address. Who's that woman? Beth called me. I don't know anyone named Beth. Let's not talk about it. Let's go to Charles. Beth, what's the meaning of this? Calm down! They're coming. And everything will make sense in just a few minutes. Charles! - Charles! - Charles! Come in! It's open! Charles! Try to come closer! Angel? Angel? Oh, sorry! I forgot to tell you. I use a different name whenever I meet your husband. Beth, why are you doing this? This is for you! What are you saying? You're no longer happy with your life, aren't you? And it's all because of them! We're better off together. Beth, that's not true. I love my family. Why? I'm also your family, am I not? Beth, have mercy. Let my son go, please. You still don't get it, do you? Why would I even use "Angel" as an alias? That's my real name! Angel, please. Whatever your reason is, let's talk about it calmly. Can you just shut the fuck up?! You keep on butting in when you know nothing! She told me everything already. She hired you to seduce me. I'm sorry for turning you down. What? You turned her down? I admit we made out but I didn't sleep with her. I did not let it happen. Your phone! Wait. You just came. Where are you going? If you're another fan of my wife, I have no time for you! By now you know, I lied to you about my family based on what I saw on your phone! But you told me? And you believed all of it. Because that's what you want to believe in. Deep down, you're no longer happy. And you're looking for an excuse to leave your family! Angel, please. Put the gun down. Let's talk about this. Talk about what? Shit! You can't even talk about your family issues! Why don't you let me help you? If it's me that you want, I'll come with you. But please let my son go! Give me the gun! Fuck you! Get off of me! Charles. Come on. Oscar! Go now or I'll shoot! Do you see how fucking useless he is?! And you dare choose him over me?! Beth, please? I'm begging you. Stop this. Your family gets in our way. But don't you say it? That time your father was not faithful to her, your mother leaned on me! I made her happy! Now your father is taking her away from me! What is she saying? Please stop. Stop this. Stop! I learned what your secretary is investigating. What did you learn? I read the files! She's that stupid! It turns out, all along, I'm the one you've been looking for! Aren't you glad?! It's not true. Before they took you as their baby, even before they met, she got pregnant out of wedlock. She gave away that baby. Do you know the baby's name? Angel. I told you. I'm your real family! Not these two! Even if you left me, destiny has brought us back together. We belong to each other! That's why I'll get rid of these two! They're obstacles! My child? My child, stop it. My child, stop? Stop it? Child? No! Your child? Mama! It's music to my ears. I love you, Mama? No! There. Charles, did you pack everything? Yes, Ma. - Are you sure? - I'm pretty sure, Ma! Your mother is just concerned. Drive safely. Don't you want us to drive you? - I can drive by myself, Ma. - Are you sure? - Take care. - Yes, Dad. I'll be there on Saturday. I wouldn't miss your exhibit. Thank you. Take care. Bye! - I'll just be here. - Okay.
