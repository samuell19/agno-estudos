WHEN YOU GET TO THE HOUSE, YOU'RE GONNA SEE HOW MUCH WORSE IT IS. LET'S GO, LUCAS. WE SURE AS SHIT ARE BREAKING SOME LAWS HERE, BIG TIME. PEOPLE GO MISSING, LUCAS. IT'S EASIER TO EXPLAIN THAT SOMEONE'S MISSING THAN TO TELL THEM WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON. LIKE THAT BULLSHIT WITH THE MOUNTAIN LION? THEY'RE NOT FROM HERE. ALIENS? FUCK NO. THEY CAME HERE WHEN I WAS A BOY, ABOUT 100 OF THEM. THE MILITARY CAME IN AND KILLED MOST OF THEM. POISONED OUR FOREST, TOO. MOST OF THEM? THEY'RE LIVING IN THE CAVERNS. SO THAT THING YOU SHOT LAST NIGHT, THAT WAS AN ALIEN, WASN'T IT? YEAH, I'M PRETTY SURE IT WAS. I'VE HEARD RUMORS ABOUT THESE. -I'VE EVEN READ SOME STUFF ON THE INTERNET-- -THE ONLY OTHER PERSON THAT KNEW ABOUT THIS WAS MY FATHER. HE SAW EVERYTHING. HEY, GO CHECK THE FRIDGE AND SEE IF TOM HAD ANY BEER. THANKS. HEY, YOU THINK THIS HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THOSE MYSTERIOUS LIGHTS THAT WERE IN THE SKY BACK IN THE '80S? -WHAT DO YOU MEAN? -LIKE '87.

IMAGINE YOU STOPPED FOR A BEER OR A CHEESEBURGER, NEXT THING YOU KNOW, A SWAT TEAM SWOOPS IN TO TAKE YOU OUT. MAN. THAT IS FUCKED UP. IT IS. THE IRONIC THING IS WE CAN'T EVEN DRINK THE WATER BECAUSE OF ALL THE SHIT THEY SPRAYED. SEEPED INTO THE GROUND. WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T DRINK THE WATER? IT'S NOT FUNNY. NOBODY TOLD ME I CAN'T DRINK THE WATER. DON'T WORRY, LUCAS. IT ONLY AFFECTS WOMEN. LOTS OF MISCARRIAGES. IT'S GETTING SO BAD, THE SIGN LEADING INTO TOWN HAS FALLEN TO DOUBLE DIGITS. HMM. WHAT ABOUT THE ALIENS? THEY'RE SLOWLY DWINDLING, TOO. THEY ONLY HAVE ONE FEMALE. A QUEEN. BUT SHE CAN'T GESTATE HER EGGS. -GES-- -SHE CAN'T HAVE BABIES. OH, WELL, GOOD THING FOR THAT. FUCKING ALIENS. DARLENE, TOOK FOUR BAGS, TOM ONLY TOOK THREE. THAT DOESN'T SEEM STRANGE TO YOU? THESE THINGS USUALLY ONLY EAT SMALL GAME. I THINK THEY'RE DEVELOPING A HANKERING FOR HUMANS. HOLY SHIT. IS THAT WHY THEY'RE SKINNING PEOPLE? I DON'T KNOW. THEY'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE. YOU EVER THINK ABOUT JUST LEAVING, GETTING THE HELL OUT OF HERE? NO. I DON'T CUT AND RUN WHEN THE SHIT GETS CRAZY, LUCAS. NOT LIKE YOU. LIKE FLEEING THE SCENE OF A ROBBERY? THEY HAD GUNS, WYATT. -REALLY? -YEAH, LIKE, BIG GUNS. REALLY? YOU KNOW, THE ONLY REASON I HIRED YOU IS 'CAUSE I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH YOUR COUSIN ANGIE. I NEED YOUR HELP ON THIS, LUCAS. BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA GO, GO. SO WHAT ABOUT BLAKE ANDERSON? WHERE DO WE THINK HE IS? THAT WASN'T BLAKE ANDERSON. WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE GIRL THAT WAS WITH THE GUY THAT WASN'T BLAKE ANDERSON? SHE'S NOT FROM AROUND HERE. WHERE'S THE HIGHWAY? YOU LIED. THERE'S NO HIGHWAY! THIS IS MORE FUCKING FOREST! NO! HOLY SHIT. WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU? I'M SORRY, EVIE. NO. AAH! NO! NO, LET ME GO! I'VE DEVOTED MY WHOLE LIFE TO PROTECTING THEM. 28 YEARS, LUCAS. I JUST WANTED THEM TO DIE OFF PEACEFULLY. WAIT A MINUTE. THAT'S A LONG TIME, BRO. ACTUALLY, IT'S REALLY WEIRD. I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE, LUCAS. YOU'VE GOT A WHOLE WORLD OUT THERE-- ON THIS PLANET! YOU NEED TO JUST GO, GET OUT THERE WHILE YOU STILL GOT A FEW YEARS LEFT. ACTUALLY, WHEN THIS IS OVER, I MEAN, LIKE, WHEN THIS IS REALLY OVER, ME AND YOU? WE'RE TAKING A TRIP TO BRANSON, MY FRIEND. A WHOLE WEEK, JUST ME AND YOU. MAYBE WE'LL VISIT MY COUSIN ANGIE, HUH? SHE'S RECENTLY DIVORCED. ASS A LITTLE BIT BIGGER THAN IT WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, BUT SHE'S STILL PRETTY FINE. SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN. ALL RIGHT, THEY'RE BACK IN THIS AREA. NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHAT'S BACK THERE. HOW MANY WE LOOKING AT? -NO MORE THAN HALF A DOZEN. -GOD. THERE'S ONLY TWO OF US, WYATT! SETTLE DOWN, LUCAS. THEY'RE GETTING OLD. THEY'RE NOT AS STRONG AS THEY USED TO BE. MAN. WHY YOU CARRYING YOUR GUN IN YOUR LEFT HAND? BECAUSE I CAN'T USE MY RIGHT HAND, WYATT. -HERE. -OOH. HOLD THIS. YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF THE FLASHLIGHT. IT'S IMPORTANT. DON'T FUCK IT UP. WE NEED NIGHT VISION GOGGLES. THAT'S WHAT "MONSTER HUNTERS" WOULD USE. LUCAS, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THE TV SHOW. "MONSTER HUNTERS?" TONIGHT THEY'D BE HUNTING BIGFOOT. THOSE GUYS REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. THIS IS NOT A TV SHOW. I KNOW. AIN'T RIGHT I GOT FIRED AT GREENVILLE, WYATT. IT'S A BUNCH OF BULLSHIT. I AIN'T A COWARD. WHAT, YOU THINK I AM? WE'RE NOT GOING IN THERE. YUP. COME ON. WYATT! WYATT! YOU CAN DO IT. COME ON. SUCK YOUR GUT IN, LUCAS. COME ON. WYATT! OKAY.

WHAT THE-- -YOU ALL RIGHT? -NO! WHAT'S WRONG? SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN. ARE YOU OUT HERE ALONE? WHAT THE FUCK DO WE DO, MAN? I DON'T KNOW. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME FOR? I DON'T KNOW, MAN. YOU'RE THE VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER. -WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING, RIGHT? -YEAH, I PUT SOME BAND-AIDS ON SOME KIDS. I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE IT'S APPENDICITIS -OR SOMETHING. -IT'S BITING ME! WE GOT TO GET HER TO A HOSPITAL. CALM DOWN, OKAY? SHIT! CALM DOWN! OH, SHIT! SHIT! WHAT THE FUCK? GET 'EM OFF ME! AAH! EVIE! EVIE! EVIE! WHERE'S EVIE? WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER? SHE'S ALIVE. HELP HER.

THERE'S AN OLD TRUCK IN THE GARAGE I WANT YOU TO TAKE IT AND GO HOME. JUST MAKE SURE YOU TAKE HIM WITH YOU. YOU REMEMBER? YOU SAID YOU WOULD TAKE CHARLIE? YEAH, IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO YOU, BUT YOU'RE FINE. HE WAS ALWAYS RUNNING AWAY. I THINK HE WAS TRYING TO TELL ME SOMETHING. WHAT'S GOING ON, WYATT? THERE'S FOUR TO FIVE DEAD BODIES IN THE WOODS, INCLUDING MY PARTNER'S. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? IT WAS A PACK OF MOUNTAIN LIONS. ONE OF 'EM WAS AS BIG AS YOU, AND HE WAS A HUNGRY SON OF A BITCH. OH, AND BY THE WAY, AS OF TOMORROW, THIS TOWN HAS NO POLICE FORCE, SO IT FALLS UNDER YOUR JURISDICTION NOW. SO YOU'RE QUITTING? THERE'S NOTHING HERE FOR ME. WYATT! MY FELLOW CITIZENS, RECENT EVENTS HAVE IMPOSED UPON THE PATRIOTIC PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY A RESPONSIBILITY AND A DUTY GREATER THAN THAT OF ANY SINCE THE CIVIL WAR. THEN IT WAS A STRUGGLE TO PRESERVE THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES...
