Hey boy, you that new Bison hand? That's right. Throw your shit in the back of the truck and get your ass in here, we ain't got all day, come on. YY Pucketts. Jim McNeely. Good to meet you. How long you been working for Bison? Shit, I've been with these son-bitches since they started. Funded by some old rich outfit up there outta Dallas that don't know shit between goddamn air. Hell them son a bitches I've been doing this still for forever started out just like where you're starting. You a weevil? A what? A boll-weevil, somebody who don't know shit. That's a fella that ain't never been out to an oil patch. What do you reckon I'll be doing? The first thing they're gonna do is they're gonna have your ass out there goddamn diggin' ditches. The next thing they gonna have you do is buckin'up four inch pipe. You get ready to get a dose of that shit. I used to have two nuts, now both of 'em's up my belly. I'll tell you right now, you'll need to the break quarter and lay down. I've seen guys didn't bathe for four days they was so god-dang tired to get in there. Thank you kindly for the ride, YY. You can thank me in two weeks. Do me a favor son, you tell that Cap Bruner that YY Pucketts said to go fuck himself! Oh, wait. Hold up! Hello. Name's McNeely. Hell, I know who you are. Another favor from corporate. Well I'm Dent Paxton, a friend to all men so long as they don't ask anything of me. Well I'm here, what do I do? You can write, I presume? You'll be in bunkhouse 1, bunk number 3, you got that? Okay, now it's time for the free lecture. Welcome to jolly Camp Dead Lake of that great octopus, the Bison Oil Company. Our sole purpose out here is to get that stinkin' crude oil out of the ground and move it on down the pipeline where it can be made into gasoline and dollars. You'll be assigned to Cap Bruner's gang, God help you. That's the connection gang, they do the oil field plumbing. It don't sound so bad. Buddy, I don't know what you've been doing but whatever it is, I guarantee you it's better than this. My advice to you is run like hell because you'll either get run off in a week or what's worse, you'll want to prove you're a real tough character and get indentured for life. Look, I ain't planning on gettin' run off or becoming anybody's slave, I got plans of my own. Well tough titty buddy, all hopes and illusions are blasted to pieces out here. Fair warning, go back to where you came from. I got no place to go back to. Jim McNeely, you better wait for me. I gather you think you are in love with Mazie. It ain't a thinking matter Mrs. Wales, I know I am. Listen Jim, I don't think it's for the best that you and Mazie see one another. What the hell? Who's that layin' up in your best, Buster? Look, he's got his fucking shoes on in my bed. You keep your goddamn dirty clodhoppers off my sheets. Hey, what's the idea? The clerk feller told me to take bunk three. That queer don't know shit. This boll-weevil must be one of them college athletes. He looks like a little two-bit hotshot to me. Ain't that right? Hotshot, you got dirt in those ears? I answer to the name McNeely. Know your goddamn place, you stay down. Get off him. You leave this bunk be, hotshot. Go on. Assholes. I got plans. Face the facts, Jim. You're a checker in a grocery store and that is all you're equipped by background or education to be. Piece of shit. I want you to see my husband. He has important friends, he'll get you a good job somewhere. Perhaps out in the oil fields. Ort! Take that boll-weevil and get to piss-antin' them joints. By God, you'd best keep up today. Just hook your hand in the belt, do like I do. When I say hump, heister-up and take off. Ain't nothin' but back and guts. All right. Here we go. Hump. Step back! Looks like hotshot's eyes gonna bug out of his fucking head. Why don't you go ahead and check him, Peaches? Goddamn you sorry ass boll-weevil. Are you trying to get somebody killed? What gives, you little rat? That's right, I'm a little rat and this little rat'll bite ya. Move your ass, boll-weevil. Come on. Come on. There ya go. All right everybody up, let's go. All right, that's breeeeak! Yeah, not you McNeely. Been expecting you, just didn't know when. You win. I win, do I get a trophy? You said it, nothing here for me. Look. Personally I don't give a damn. It's completely immaterial to me. But I hate to give those Neanderthal bastards the pleasure of running you off. I can't do it. You came here with something to prove. Now I don't know to who but I do see it in you. Besides... you don't have anything to go back to. Sit down. Can I get a raise? All right, puttin' you in pairs today and see if we can't spread out the line. Cotton, you go with Scrap. Buster, you've got Jim. You're going down, hotshot. Buster, can I talk to you? Hot damn, that must've stung good. Somehow you've got the idea that you need to break me. You're gonna leave me be from here on out, if you wanna live. Don't think I'm gonna fight you fair. That I won't do. And you got something to say to me, you call me by my name. That's McNeely. Buster! Shut up, you little rat. ¶ Call my black cat back ¶ Well I get up on Monday and I call my black cat back ¶ ¶ My black cat comes a-running ¶ And the hound dogs, they get back ¶ ¶ Get back, way back Howdy fellas. You a boll-weevil? Nah, I'm Clayton LeMane the Third. Jim McNeely. Damn good to meet ya, Jim. Quit your fraternizing Stabber and get back to work. Just like I was saying Mr. LeMane, there's a lot to gettin' a days work out of a bunch of hands. That sure is good to know Captain, seeing as I'm a hand now too. I'll be sure to put in a word with my uncle for how amiable you've been. Pay up son, them beers don't buy themselves. You know why I'm so poor and measly? Because my daddy was such a tight old son of a bitch, he used to pay me 10 cents not to have supper. Then that bastard would charge me a dime every morning for breakfast. Meanest man there ever were. It's a wonder I growed at all. Pity you did, you old liar. No sir, I ain't lying, that there I know. Oh Lord, here she comes. Hi Dent. Ma'am. Hey ma'am, what can I get? Boy, I am in love with that engineer's wife. You are just a randy old goat, what do you know about love? When you sack up with someone you still wanna kiss her in the morning when you're through, that is it. You better shut your trap. If Clyde Montgomery hears you talking that way about his wife, you'll be outta camp yesterday. I bet she flangs that silly Montgomery around 'til he don't know which way west is. She sure is something to look at. Yeah but lookin' at it ain't getting it, now is it? Which reminds me fellas, I got some business to transact in Odessa. Take the strain off. Adios. If they cut his head open, wouldn't nothing come out but a pile of cockroaches. Ain't that the truth. Excuse me, ma'am. Bye Dent. Ma'am. Mm-mm. Hm. What are you doing out here so far from the other rigs? I'm seeing if this wildcat's worth drilling. The damn lease is about to expire, so I gotta see what's going on underneath. I'm a geologist for Bison, name's Barry Wakely. Barry, Jim, Jim McNeely. We cut the damn hole. Now it's time to see how smart or how dumb we really are. We can pay more money to complete the well or shut her in. Who makes that decision? Me, that's who. Me and this swab test. Oou. It's oil. Yeah, that's oil. Glad I checked. Ever thought about going out on your own? I've thought about it. Well if you run across an oil field nobody's found yet, maybe you and I can grab it. Coker field. As in Coker City? The old codger won't lease it out. Convince him and your name will be known for 14 counties, hell maybe all the way up to Fort Worth. A couple broke bastards like us can't compete with the big boys. Good thing I enjoy sniffin' them rocks. That damn Pluto's as worthless as a one-legged man in an ass kicking contest. Spent the entire day behind a bush and Cap didn't do a goddamn thing about it. Why should he? He's the nephew of the Vice-President of Bison. A blue blood through and through. The luck lands on the sorriest, most worthless souls. Good work out there today, boys. How much we got now? I've got.. $3,221. Oou. Tell you what let's do, let's take that 3,221 and let's go down to old Mexico. We'll get us a big old house with plenty of tequila and some cute little muchachos and man, we'll have us a time. And when we're cashed out? Well then we come back here and save up another 3,221 and do it all over again. Oh goddamn, I like the sound of it. It sure sounds sweet. This here is my ticket outta here, fellas. Indentured for life my ass, sweetie pie. Where you headed? To town, you inquisitive little bastard, by myself. To Mexico. Tell Cap Bruner to kiss my ass, ha ha ha! Hello. Hello. It's a lovely afternoon. I hadn't noticed 'til now. It must be the contrast, it was a real scorcher today. Yeah it was, fella on the rig said he saw a lizard crawl up a steam pipe just to cool off. Really? Fella said it, I can't say about the lizard. I'm headed into town to get some candles. My husband said the electricity's going out for a while tonight? Yeah, they're cuttin' a new pumping station into the power line but it shouldn't be out too long. Is that why you're going into town too? For candles? And razorblades. Do you want a ride? Sure, thanks ma'am. I don't make a practice of picking up strange men in the middle of the road but I recognized you. It's mighty kind of you. Tell me Mr. McNeely, how are you enjoying your stay in Dead Lake? You can call me Jim. But if I call you Jim, then you should call me Lee. I'll call you Mrs. Montgomery like I'm supposed to. I guess it wouldn't be proper, what a world. It sure is. Me being me and you being you. I didn't mean it like that. Thanks Arnie. You bet. Arnie, I'm gonna need another pack of razorblades. Let me get a couple Schlitz to go. Thank you. Thanks for waiting. Mm hmm. How about a cold beer to ease us along? Are you offering me a beer? No, I'm just trying to pay you for the ride is all. Thank you. I had almost forgotten how good a cold beer tastes. If you had a million dollars, you couldn't enjoy it any more. I'll remember that. I'll tell you what, you can call me 'Hey' and I'll call you 'Say' and then next time we meet, you could say "Hey, how you doing?" And I'll respond "Say, good to see you." I like that. Thank you, you should get out here, people talk. Thanks again. ¶ Da, da da ¶ ¶ Da da da ¶ All right, turn it. Come on. ¶ I love you ¶ One, two, three, snap! Come on, get it in. One, two, three. Damn! One, two, three. Snap! ¶ Of all the things that ever lived, I choose you ¶ ¶ To rue me, ¶ ¶ my Roooooosemary ¶ All right boys, let's drink. Just a goddamn minute. You ain't drawin' enough money to be givin' the orders to these men. A man don't live that makes enough money to tell me when I can and won't drink. All right you scraps of nothing... get back to work! Thank you. Razorblades? Yeah. Come on. Mazie's a beautiful name, you might still marry her. I got pretty good instincts. No. All that's over and done with now. Besides, she doesn't bother me anymore, only-- Only what? Say what you're thinking. You should've just dropped me off at the gate. I know. You fill up my whole head, Lee. What? It's true. Don't talk like that. What are you doing? Jim. Oh God, Get off of me. Get out! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, uh... Please get out before I scream! I'm sorry, I just thought... You know, I've got instincts too. You don't love the man you're married to. Stabber, come over here. Jesus Christ. Tonight's my last night. I'm saying sayonara to this shit hole manyana. You'll be missed, Pluto. Hey, what do you say me and you hit the town to celebrate? I got some moolah... They paid me off and it ain't even payday yet. I don't think so, man. Hey the next time you see me, you'll be calling me El Jefe. Or maybe I'll be calling you boss man and you'll be running these gangs. Come on, just a couple drinks, Stabber. Okay then. OK, that's what I like to hear. Don't you think that old Pluto is gonna forget about you. You oughta be Cap's boss and I got a toast to make. Ladies and gentlemen, here is the best, damn pipe liner in all of West Texas. Sit your ass down, Pluto. I give you the one, the only Jim... Stabber McNeely. ¶ Just a little more love, then I'd be dreaming ¶ ¶ I could do, yeah ¶ That's it Jim, you'll feel better now. You're a bonafide drunkard now, welcome to the club. Move it! Get up from there, you gold-bricking son of a bitch. Think you're a little too smart to be laying pipe no more? You're just asking to get your ass run off. You need to get the drain plate off that tank. It ain't bleeding the bullshit out of the bottom. Maybe that'll wake your ass up. - That Cap's a son of a bitch. - Yes sir. Florina, Florina ¶ Where'd you stay last night ¶ ¶ Florina, Flori--na! ¶ ¶ Where'd you go last night? ¶ ¶ Come home in the morning ¶ ¶ And the sun don't shine ¶ ¶ Florina, Floriiinaaa ¶ ¶ Where'd you stay last night ¶ Florina... That swamp gas is gettin' to his head. It'll kill his ass unless we get him outta there quick. ¶ Go home in the morning and the sun ¶ Jim. Jim? Get up, you sorry son of a bitch. Come on, Jim. Come on, get him. Get him son. Come on. Get up. Yeah! That a boy Jim. My boy Jim. You piece of shit. Hey. Say. I heard all about what you did. You know I'm leaving for good. I figured. Where you headed? Dent, I did it. I married her and now you and everyone in this God-forsaken world can call her Lee McNeely. How about that? You always asked what my money was for. Well you'll be content to know I found some use for it. And who knows? Maybe someday I'll need some good, cheap labor if you happen to know anyone interested. Well? It smells delicious, hon. Don't gimme that, tell me something. We are the sole owners of the sorriest, oldest oil field servicing company in all of West Texas. Ooh, I knew it. Oh calm down now. I made a bad deal. I bought out Mrs. Sullivan on the worst layaway plan known to man and maybe, just maybe, if I work 18 hours a day, seven days a week and give up breakfast and chewing gum and picture shows and I get an amazing string of luck, we might just be able to make the payments. I don't care. You will care when we're eating beans every night. I love beans. Oh! You know, the surefire way to get through to an old timer is to get down on his level. Make him laugh. I know what I'm doing. I know you do, big boss man. Shut up. Mr. Coker? My name's Jim McNeely. That road you just come on in on don't lead nowhere but right here. Mr. Coker, I heard it said in Odessa that you'd shoot the next fella that came out here asking about leasing the Coker ranch. I ain't a lease broker and I damn sure don't aim to get shot, neither. What in the confounded hell do you want? Not a damn thing sir, unless you'd spare a little of that Beechnut you're chewin' on. They say you're a fool 'cause you refuse to lease your land. You'd rather let 'em rob you blind than get what's rightfully yours. Shit with what they say. I don't agree with 'em or I wouldn't be here. I just think you haven't been offered a fair deal yet. You need a partner who can help you get the oil out of the ground before they suck you dry. You're the worst goddamn tobacco chewer I ever seen in my life. I never claimed to be an expert in chewing tobacco or anything else. I'm just a poor boy trying to get by. Take a look at it. Driller! Let's test this son of a bitch. Goddamn. Driller, give me two more feet. You did it, you did it. We're in the oil business now, sugar. Barry. What is this? That's your 1 % interest. But Jim, I'm happy to help an old friend. Hell with that. I wouldn't have even known about this deal without you. Thank you, Jim. So you're telling me, you got no geological stats, no geophysics, nothing but a lot of hot air and high hopes? And cheap leases, sir. $6 an acre, can't beat that. Not a uh... deal for the risk-averse, that's for sure. Not exactly my idea of aggressive expansion, Dent. Well I'm no geologist and Scurry County's not oil country. However, it's a shit load of cheap land in West Texas without a hole in it. I'm willing to give y'all until tomorrow morning to consider it. Otherwise I'm just gonna shop it on down the road. Santa Rita, gimme a sign. Hot damn. Hot damn. To bet it all on a stupid horseshoe? Goddammit. Well, how did it look? Hmm, like you said. Cheap lease is for a reason. You know I was thinking we could redo the guest bedroom. Redo what? We already got a bed and a dresser in there already. What else do we need? We haven't even had a guest over once. I don't know, maybe a kids room. You know, someday. Hon, we barely have time for you and I. How the hell are we gonna have time for kids? We make time, that's how it's done. It won't be easy but I will have a son so I can teach him how to be a real cowboy, work the land. Cowboy huh, cowboy huh? You want a son? ¶ Hello walls ¶ ¶ Hello, hello ¶ ¶ How'd things go for you today ¶ ¶ Don't you miss her ¶ ¶ Since she up and walked away ¶ ¶ And I'll bet you dread to spend ¶ ¶ Another lonely night with me ¶ ¶ But lonely walls, I'll keep you company ¶ Ted. ¶ Hello window ¶ ¶ Hello, hello ¶ ¶ Well I see ¶ Bob, Tom. Boss. You know I bought a good lease with a bad title. I got seven days to pay it off. Two of the heirs are in court right now feuding over the block that I want. So renew the lease from both heirs, drill it and the royalty money will go to the court. Then when the suit is settled, they'll give it to the rightful owner, easy-peasy. Hell, I don't even have the money to renew it from one of 'em. Then drill it before the lease expires. In seven days? We need a partner and we needed one yesterday. Mr. Naylor, my name's Jim McNeely, President of McNeely Oil Company, can I have a word with you? What's this all about? Can't you see I'm having a meeting here? Mr. Naylor, I'm about to move a rig on the Turpin section, offsetting your Sheets lease. I intend to be making a hole by Monday unless someone stops me. Hell, I've never heard of whatever the hell company you're supposed to be President of. Sir, would you like to hear what I have to say or not? Guess he liked my speech. Hello. Hi. Just how much money are you drawing, Mrs. McNeely? Not enough to put up with you clowns, that's for sure. You're fired. What? Whaaaaat? You're fired. Oh yeah. I'm trading you in for a full time wife. You can paint up that little room you've been talking about. Consul just bought a piece of our lease and hired us to drill it, we start on Monday. This sly son of a silver-tongued devil walked over to the President of Consul Petroleum and sold him the damn deal outta nowhere. Ah ha. I nailed that son of a bitch. Yes you did. I've got the prettiest girl in the state of Texas. ¶ Cheers, here's to you and me ¶ ¶ Baby can't you see ¶ y Jim, I've been looking at it.. It's a great prospect. Yes Jim! You did it! Yes. ¶ North, south, east or west ¶ ¶ We've got whatever it takes ¶ ¶ We'll make our own lucky breaks ¶ ¶ So clear the decks for action ¶ ¶ Guaranteed satisfaction ¶ ¶ We'll go all the way, stand or fall ¶ ¶ So cheers ¶ ¶ To one and all ¶ So soon, you pass me off that soon? Goddammit. There's only a rare few of these to be found. Now there's one less. They'd offered it to me and I threw it out the window. But you told me not to buy cheap leases. So now it's my fault? So what if you did buy Scurry County? We'd be sloppy rich by now? What would you have that you haven't already got? A title like millionaire? In case you haven't heard, I am a millionaire. Jim. No wait, you add up the value of the oil in the ground and the rig and the new office building and this house that you live in, subtract what I owe, there's a million dollars left. And what does that do? What are you gonna do with more money? Where do you stop wanting, when? When you really get to be a millionaire? I am a millionaire, goddammit! Well yippee for you. Hey. Say. There's something I forgot to tell you. We're moving to Fort Worth. Surprise. I knew we were going, I just didn't know when. My God, the houses just keep on gettin' bigger. Yeah and the jerks that live in 'em too. Tomorrow I'm gonna show you the new headquarters for the McNeely Oil Company. I'm gonna kick my boots up on my desk every day and make like a big oilman. When did this all come about? Dent took care of it. What do you think about this one? It looks like a small castle. They're having a party, there's music. Oh. It's for you. But I don't know anyone here. Yet. This is a housewarming party honey, for you. What? This is your new castle and since you're the queen of it, you get a key. Jim, what have you done? Don't worry about it. We're home. Hey y'all, howdy. You traitorous bastard. Lookin' great, honey. Charley. Jim, Lee. Welcome home. It took y'all long enough to get out of that dustbowl but I trust you'll find yourselves comfortable here. Excuse me gentlemen if I use the powder room. Jim McNeely, welcome back to Fort Worth. You sure have made quite a name for yourself out West. He certainly has. Yeah, I've done all right. A far cry from the days on the schoolyard, right? That was a long time ago, Jim. Charley here was just telling us about your latest streak. Well, Charley tell 'em about our last deal that bought you that new Cadillac. Maybe we'll get y'all in on our Reeves County prospect. Sounds all right to me. Excuse me boys, y'all get a drink or 10. One well, one Cadillac, easiest money I ever made. You still think you can struggle along in this little old bungalow? Looks like a damn museum. Everyone's impressed, repulsed but impressed. But that's what you wanted, isn't it? You done good, Denty boy. I even got you a little something. Well open it, dammit. Are you proposing? You wish. Thank you. For everything. Alright. Don't go gettin' all sentimental on me. I need a drink. Buster? Jim McNeely. Hello Mrs. Wales. You do look wonderful. Why thank you. You look mighty sharp yourself. I'm so glad you invited me. I just wish Dr. Wales had lived to see it. Come on. Let's walk. Yes ma'am. It's a lovely house, Jim. It is, isn't it? I remember it when I was a girl. I remember a lot of things too. Now Jim, the past is a long time gone. You have done so magnificently well. I'd like to think Dr. Wales and I were partly responsible for giving you the push in the right direction. I'd say it was a pretty good shove. Now you know bitterness will suck the pleasure right out of things. How's Mazie? I don't know how much you know. It hasn't been all sunshine for Mazie. I'm sorry to hear that. I figured y'all had it made. Pluto, I mean Clayton, he comes from such good stock. Mrs. Wales, can I get you a drink? A scotch would be wonderful. One scotch coming up. It is so good to see you, I'm so glad you're here. Thank you, Jim. Jim. You old boll-weevil. Ort. Come here, you oughta be mighty proud, son 'a bitch. Save that kinda talk for the field. I just come to congratulate you. I know you did, you look great, I love this tie. Jim. Here she is. Has she changed? Just look at her. Mom, stop. You sound like you're exhibited a registered heifer. It's good to see you, Jim. Wow. Little old Mazie Wales grew up to be even more stunning than I remember. You didn't turn out so bad yourself. Where the hell did everyone get off to? Stabber, goddamn Stabber. Pluto. Me and this man, we had us some times didn't we Jim? I've had myself some bad luck, Jim. Hey, we gots to go and talk somewhere, huh brother? Let's all go get a drink. Pluto, you still drinking, whiskey? I'm never not. I should've sent you a plant or something. But I do have another little present for you. I've been saving it. Don't open 'til Christmas. That Christmas is ancient history. I am so happy for you, Jim and I know that you have a wonderful wife now and I can't wait to meet her and do everything I can to make sure she likes it here. You might as well start now, here she comes. Honey, come here for a minute. I want you to meet a very special friend of mine, this is Mazie... LeMane! Hi Mazie, Lee McNeely, it's nice to meet you. It so nice to meet you too, Lee. Welcome to Fort Worth. Thank you. Sorry to interrupt, there are two gentlemen who seem to have settled into an all night drinking game into what I presume to be our bedroom. Do you think they would mind terribly if I put on my pajamas and slipped quietly into bed? She's funny too. I like her. I'll take care of it, honey. Jim, I think it's time you kicked us all out and I will get to know this wonderful wife of yours soon enough. That's very nice of you. I'll lead you out. All right. I'll be out there in a minute. Good show, old man. Good to see ya. Two diamonds. You gotta beat three, sweetie. This country bumpkin here is used to throwin' dice with cowboys, not playing bridge. Cowboys? Well that sounds fun. You kill me, Lee. I admire you. Me? Why on earth? Havin' the courage to leave your first husband. I mean weren't you worried about people talking? We didn't stick around to find out what people would say or do, it all happened so fast. Way you describe feeling back then, that's the way I feel right now. Oh. Mazie, it was so much different for me. Look at all that you have. You live in a city, the people. Pluto, I mean Clayton, he is such a fine young man from a good family. Look at this pity party. Shake it off, that's what I do and drink of course. Thank you. It's strange to be served dinner. Well get used to it, sugar. I don't know what to do in this big house, Jim. Can I come work in the office? How's your new accountant doing, does he need help? No, my wife's not working at a damn office. Besides, I thought you'd like to be a lady of leisure. Leisure and boredom seem to go hand in hand. Leisure and business, that's how deals are made. Speaking of, Pluto's going to drop by later for a drink, says he's got an ace of a deal to show me. I thought we could have some time alone tonight. For once. He's my old oil field buddy, you know? You get mighty close working on those gangs together. Oh, and Mazie's tagging along too. Oh? I have to say, I didn't know how I feel about Mazie. But I do like her, she's down to earth beneath all those fancy clothes. She's a good girl, harmless. I'm glad you two are getting along. I win again. Hey Lee, why don't you come over here and give a girl a hand taking down these knuckleheads? I gotta say it, I hate cards and I'm going to bed. Don't be so sour, sugar. I'm not being sour, I'm just tired. Hey. Hey. I can send them home, honey. Nah. Y'all are having fun, I am being sour. You enjoy yourselves. Goodnight y'all. Goodnight, honey. Goodnight. All right Stabber, come and deal 'em up you goddamn field hand. Let's beat this girl. Oh please. She's cheating. Hello. Hey sweetheart. Pack your bags, we're going to West Texas for the weekend. West Texas, where, just you and me, what should I bring? Oh hell, just bring a toothbrush. Do some cowgirl shopping over at Lettie's. I'll pick you up at 11. - Are you crazy? That's in an hour. Yeah well, we'll arrive just in time for dinner. Jim! Upgrade us to the Presidential Suite. I mean if you're gonna do it right, you gotta do it right, right sugar? Sounds wonderful. Stabber. What took y'all so long to get here? Hey Lee. I should've warned you. Hi Jim. Jim, this is a business trip? Honey, it's an everything trip. Let's go check out our suite. Gentlemen, we've drilled nine prospects together. Five were dry, four produced. The one in Reagan County is just so-so. I wouldn't recommend drilling any more there. We'll just, we'll farm it out to another operator. What we should all be thinking is looking for something with a little more juice in it. How long you think it's gonna take for that Reagan well to pay out? At current production rates, about three and a half years. Oh, well that don't sound too bad. Why can't we just drill the rest of that lease ourselves? The Reagan well's cuttin' water and history's taught me when you get water, that water's just gonna increase. I don't make money if you boys don't make money. Our oil in the ground today will produce hefty returns. Hell, we might even find another East Texas. Or Scurry County. I'm gonna drill these wells on my own or with other partners if y'all ain't interested. Hold on a minute Jim, nobody said we weren't interested. Good. After this next string of wildcats, we'll take that safari trip courtesy of McNeely Oil of course. All right. I don't know if you gentlemen know this but one of my life's great ambitions is to kill every species that exists. I got about 100 of 'em so far. Let me know when you get around to homo sapiens, so I can hide. My wife's a comedienne. Oh Jim, I have been dying to kill an elephant. Honey, I'll fix it so that you kill the biggest damn elephant in Africa. You could mount his foot for an umbrella stand, paint his toenails gold. Dent, line up a safari. You should come too, we'll need somebody to mix drinks. Yes B'wana. Well boys, this next string's gonna be real nice. Don't worry too much about this circus, little buddy. There are very few people in this jolly new milieu of ours who live lives of any real significance. All our new playmates seem to dedicate their lives to pleasuring themselves. Sybarites, stay up late, drink deep from the laughing waters and burn your incense at sunset to the God of Fun. Count me out. The cabbie's loaded up. I'm too close to home to not go see it and by golly, close that deal. I always do. I got a good feeling about this next prospect. It might be enough to retire on. Wouldn't that be nice? Someday we will, hon. Hey. I know. Drive safe sugar, I'll see you tomorrow. Tell dad hi. This old knee's givin' me a little trouble. But nothing an ice pack and a shot of rye can't fix. Enough about my health. Spill it. What's wrong? You didn't drive all the way out here just to make me dinner. It's an empty life we're living. All these men he used to know now swarming around us just because he struck a few wells. But he's trying to be a part of something that I just don't care about. - Oil men want respect. It's a disease. It makes most crazy and others crooked. Breaks the hearts of the strong and rewards a few lucky ones with wealth and power beyond their deserving. Jim thinks he lost his luck at Scurry. Maybe he did. Help him find his luck, darling. Do that and you'll both be necessary to one another. Oh. Jim. Nothing? What the hell do you mean by nothing? She doesn't want anything. Not the house, no money. Just the divorce. She's got a legal right to what's hers. She said she can work and you'll need all the money you have and then some. What? What the hell does that mean? Listen, you find out what I'm worth and she'll damn sure take half of that. You go back and lay that on the line right now. Why don't you go? I sent word I wanted to meet. What else am I supposed to do? In the spot you're in buddy, you don't send emissaries. You get over there, you get down on your knees and beg for forgiveness. Unless of course you want this divorce. Who is it? It's me, Lee. What do you want? I want to talk. What do you wanna talk about? I didn't mean to hurt you, it just happened. It's just stupid drunken behavior, that's all. You've loved her since she left you. No. No. This is exactly what you wanted and you damn well know it. Just get outta here so we can get this over with. I've suffered long enough, you son of a bitch. It's over now, I'm done with it. Please, I love you. Go away. Leave me alone. I never want to see you again. Goddammit. Shut this son of a bitch down right now, we're empty. This is my eighth dry well in a row and it better be the last. Shit Jim, you say that like I'm a rock-sniffin' geologist. I ain't nothin' but a two-bit pie-playing son of a bitch. I told you all not to eat that bone-in chicken on the rig. Bad luck. Bad luck. You didn't wish me a happy birthday. Happy birthday, Jim. Happy. It's a stupid word, it doesn't mean anything. You measure it by success. - Successful birthday then. A man who owes $3 million and is only 36 has gotta be successful. I wouldn't ride that theory too long. So what if we hadn't found another East Texas, we got reserves in the ground. And our investors are starting to doubt those reserves. Look, I like risks just as much as you do but sometimes I wish you'd let some of these deals pay out before we get in any deeper. Stop being so neurotic. We'll hit a sweet spot soon. I'm just being realistic and I wish you'd take off that tire. It makes me feel like I'm one heartbeat away from unemployment. Ah hell Denty boy, I've had too much fun puttin' it on. Besides, I got a heart that's stronger than bull rhinoceros hide. You know it's Lee's birthday in a couple days. Send her some flowers, see if she needs anything. Already taken care of. Now there's a gift worth the wait. Isn't it lovely to be married to a man who buys me presents on his birthday? Are you boys ready to go? I'm ready. I love my bracelet. The Bison stock's done well. It sounds like you've got a nice nest egg. They don't care a damn about a geologist who put in 20 years. I'll be scratchin' by just to make my retirement. Somebody somewhere must owe you something. I'm standing here with my hand out, waiting for the mana to drop. I got news for you, buddy. Mana don't drop. You gotta reach up and pluck it. I don't know how, Jim. Never been able to. This whole country's riddles with damn holes. Every time they drill a new one, that's one less place to try. I'm tired of drilling blind. I got the rigs, I know where to get the money and I can drill better than anyone in this goddamn state. But... I gotta know where to drill. You tell me where and you will never draw another poor breath again. Am I being too subtle for you, Barry? No. You're not being subtle, Jim. It sounds like you're talkin' about larceny. It's just a little map with a dot on it. Baby, are you okay? Never better. I was beginning to look like a ragdoll, so I had to go shopping. The Neiman's card was declined but I just paid in cash. Buy whatever the hell you need. Jim. This house is a far cry from Bowie Street, ain't it? Jim, what's wrong baby? Good morning, sunshine. This won't wash, Jim. Leave Barry Wakely out of your schemes. You can do whatever the hell you want with Bison but leave Barry alone. It's funny how it comes full circle. You feeling sorry for poor old Bison Oil Company that's got more money than Uncle Sugar. You can't wreck a man like that and get away with it, it will wreck you too. I see you got your preacher suit on, today, ready to give me hell. Well Barry has got a retarded son who's gonna wreck his life is he doesn't get money somewhere. You know you've gotten mighty damn spoiled workin' for me livin' it up. You're a real exotic little gentleman with mighty expensive tastes. But if this outfit goes bust, you're gonna be out on your ass starvin' to death. So quit actin' like a goddamn neurotic woman. I'm trying to run an oil business. Jim, you can still undo what you started. We can go back to West Texas and run our rigs. So what if we've crapped out here? At least we can look in the mirror without throwing up. Get outta here. Hey, don't make a crook outta him. You can be a crook because you don't believe it's crooked. Did you ever stop to think you're a sucker fish who's been living off a mean, mean shark all these years? This is Dent you're talking to. Yes Dent, my pervert philosopher. As far as I'm concerned, you're a useless queer. Get outta my sight. Get outta my life, I got a well to drill. I've had to live with myself the best way I could, but I never hurt anybody so far as I know or corrupted anybody with my own corruption. ¶ How many ¶ ¶ Times ¶ ¶ Have you heard someone say ¶ ¶ If I had his money ¶ ¶ I could do things my way ¶ ¶ But little did they know ¶ ¶ That it's so hard to find ¶ ¶ One rich man in 10 ¶ ¶ With a satisfied mind ¶ ¶ Once I was winning ¶ ¶ In fortune and fame ¶ ¶ Everything that I dreamed for ¶ Jim! Shit. Everything is about to blow. Let's hope so. Your investors and the New York Bank both want certified audits, they're serious Jim. The hell with them, I'm drilling a hellcat. They want you to shut down and not spend another dime. Are they outta their fuckin' minds? I'm drilling a well right now that will pay off everybody. They will force you into bankruptcy. Well how long can you hold them off? Jim, I'm a lawyer. Not a shyster. - Jesus Christ! When did everybody get so goddamn moral? You lawyers will steal and lie for a rich client but you run like chickens when it's a poor bastard who's in a jam. You no longer represent me, that's all Scottie. What the hell's going on? It's just a kink, boss. Then get back to drilling, dammit. Jim has been so damn irritable. I warned him if he kept deserting me for a pile of clanking machinery that I was gonna replace him with something a little more animate. I have to be honest with you, Mazie. You're coming to the end of the line with your pudgy old magnate. He's in trouble, your Jim. It's a funny thing, isn't it? What's that, sweetheart? I guess eventually, we all wash up. You? Oh. I would never say that about you. No, not me. Not if I can help it. I'm... so... Be better today. - Yes sir. Need some tall guys do. - We need new daylight water. What? James McNeely? Who want to know? My name's Michael Arthur, Division Attorney for Bison Oil. You sir are drilling on a lease that doesn't belong to you. You acquired this lease through the defalcation of a trusted Bison employee, a geologist by the name of Barry Wakely. Those leases belong to Bison. In order to save embarrassing yourself, my company is willing to pay any out of pocket costs you've incurred provided you sign those leases right back to us. No charges will be filed against you or Mr. Wakely if you do so. Did Barry Wakely tell you this bedtime story? Wakely disappeared and that is a clear admission of guilt. We know he's been meeting with you. Yeah? Yeah? Yes. I've known him for over 15 years, on and off. He's a friend of mine. We worked together at Bison partnering while you were still making mud pies. I know all about your record at Bison and I know I'm dealing with a pro. But Bison has been unscrupulously looted and we'll spare no time or expense getting back what's rightfully ours. Mister lawyer, you folks are way outta line. So you just draw up your papers and sue me, hotshot. We'll see you in the courthouse. If she's dry, I'll buy you a drink 'cause nobody will give a shit but me. If she comes roaring in like a wildcat oughta, well then we'll have something worth suing about. I hope we both have work to do. Jim! What? I'm running late. It's the crew, we's two weeks late on pay. I got it covered, just keep drilling. Mr. McNeely, how about upgrading your Corvette today? Shit Red, how about buying her back? Never did like the color my wife picked out anyhow. But it's gotta be cash. Cash will cost you, Jim. But I'm sure we can work something out. Put it here, partner. Great. Come on let's go in here, I'll buy you a drink boy. I can use a couple, Red. Dent? Dent Paxton, where have you been you naughty boy? Mexico's changed. The colors have faded and gone. I can't imagine that, how could it? It's true, they were vivid once. Now they've all gone white. So I came back home, home is where the heart is. Isn't that touching? I made it up. Dent, whatever it is, it won't last forever. Life is strange is all. You only need to breathe and to love to enjoy it. But we make it so complicated for no understandable reason. Why? Goddammit. Munson, can I get a goddamn drink in here or what? Mr. McNeely, I seen Mr. Paxton here just a few minutes ago. I thought he was going for fresh air. Where did he go, Mr. Munson? Best man I ever knew. Yeah. Too good for this world. We hit 12,000 feet but we need to pull the bit. We only got 400 feet to go, can't you just keep turning her right? It'll run the cone off if we don't pull the bit up out of that hole. Goddammit, just snake that pipe out of that hole and put the new drill bit on right now. Do it, Ort. All right, Jim. Fuck. Take the drill, you see that bit in there? Yes sir. - All right well pitch it out, pull that son of a bitch off. Yes sir. How long that gonna take? Couple hours. Bullshit, let's move it. Get that bit outta there before noon. Let's go, boys. Ain't got time here to dally, let's go, come on. Move your ass! Shit, gas! Clear, gas! Everybody clear out! Hey Jim. Jim, come on buddy. Jim, you all right? You okay, buddy? He broke his arm and several ribs but that's not the main trouble. He's had a massive coronary thrombosis. He's sedated but he's conscious. I'm glad you're here, you must be his wife. Um... Yes. I thought so, he's been saying your name all night. Lee, right? Hey. Say. I had the worst damn nightmare. You left me and I married that grubber Mazie. It was awful. Dent killed himself. And Ort... I can still smell the swamp gas. Jimmy. Hi. Are you daddy? - Yeah. You a little cowboy? Did you see that? - Yeah, it's a chicken. It's a chicken. Come on, boys.
