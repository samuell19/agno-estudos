(dramatic music) (slow, suspenseful music) (shouting) - Shut the fuck up! (fires gun) - Where was you? - Taking care of business. - All right, that's my boy. You know I hope you bet everything. The money, the house, your car, your TV, your jewelry, cash, your moms. I'm gonna beat the black off this scrawny Nigerian bitch, he looks like your ugly ass girlfriend. - Victor ain't gonna carry us no more. So don't try anything fancy. Just like I taught you. - Don't be taking credit for my success now. - [Jimmy] Looks rough. - Can't beat me. It's physiologically impossible. Plus I'm too smart for him. (crowd shouting) - Shit. (screams) How many fingers I got? - Four. (crowd shouting) (growling) - Grab his head man, hold on, hold on! - What's up? - Bitch. - Just playing possum. Why'd you stop him for? - Damn fucker, you lost. Go see Victor. (distant sirens wailing) - You two have been gambling and losing for as long as I can remember. - Nobody told us he'd be fighting a pro. I mean that guy was serious. - Where's the dough? - Come on. He didn't stand a chance in there. (shouts) How much money you got? - About 50 bucks. - You know, I don't think I like the sound of this. Hmm. Is this a joke? Because I'm not sure I follow. - What's wrong? - What's wrong. Oh, you're light. Looks live over 12 grand. - 12 grand? I bet less than half that. - You did, well, your friend did, he bet more than half that. - Sorry, man. - I think I would like my money now. - You know us, Vic. You know me. We're good for it. - Calm down, baby. Let me rub your shoulders. You're so strong. - Would somebody grab this bitch? (shouting) (screaming) - She's an annoying little piece, but I like her a hell of a lot more than I do you two. So just imagine what I'll do if you get me mad. Get my money, or find out. Get the fuck out of my office, you ass bag. Get out! Bring me my fucking money tomorrow! (laughing) - Was that good? - Shut your stinking pie hole! Look at all this shit, you got it all over my clothes, Yoko. (steady hip hop beat) - [Emcee] Once again ladies and gentlemen, just remember, Victor's Champagne Lounge open seven days a week... (emcee talking indistinctly) - Hey Jim. - Hey. The usual. - Hey Jimmy. How about about a private dance? - I don't think my girlfriend would appreciate that. - That's not what I heard. - Please. - All right, your loss. - Allow me. Keep the change, Deb. - [Deb] Thank you. - Thanks, man. - You're quite the ladies' man. - They get paid to act like that. - Well, they're quite good at it. I heard you mention your lady friend. Is she anything like these young vixens at this establishment? - Why don't you ask her? There she is. - My goodness, you're a lucky man. - Thanks. - If I wasn't a married man with a family, I'd be quite tempted by that young angel. But guilt would overwhelm me. You know my wife and child are away for week? God forbid they should be aware of my desire for fleshy sin. - What the hell does that mean? - Merely that I should be on my best behavior. - There's no law against having a good time, buddy. - Don't misunderstand me, I have high moral standards. Shall we have a toast? - Yeah, okay. - Shall we say to love? - To love. (chuckling) Thanks for the drinks. - You're not leaving. I was just beginning to enjoy myself. - Catch you later. (chuckles) - [Emcee] Oh, what do you say, all you VIP platinum customers? Check it out... (rain falling) â™ª La la la la la la la la (tires squealing) (loud rap music) (screaming) - Get the fuck out. Go. (thunder rumbling) (light music) - Oh, you're soaking wet. Get in the car before you catch your death of cold. Are you injured? - No. Just a little bit upset. (sniffling) Could you take me to a phone? - Yes, of course. Look, who was he? - My boyfriend. My ex-boyfriend. - Why did he do that? - I don't know. I don't want to talk about it. - Yes, I'm sorry. I haven't properly introduced myself. My name is William, but my friends call me Bill. Bill Fontaine. - Hi Bill. I'm Heather. - Hello. Do you live nearby? - No. - Well where were you heading? - Nowhere. I just need to get to a phone. - This is going to sound very funny, but the closest telephone is probably the one at my house. (thunder crashing) Blast. (muttering) Oh, that's better. (laughs) - Nice place. - Oh, thank you. - Who did the decorating? - My wife. - You're married. - Happily. (thunder crashes) (bird squawking) (laughing) - The electricity's very bad around here. - So, where's your wife? - Well she's gone away on a short holiday, with our daughter. The telephone's just through there in the kitchen. - Okay. - I'll be right back with some dry things. (thunder rumbling) Did you get through to anyone? - The phone's dead, I think it's broke. - That's strange, let me see. Must be the storm. I'm really sorry about this. - Oh, it's not your fault. - This is turning into a hassle for you. You're welcome to stay the night, and tomorrow morning I can bring you anywhere you need to be. - What would your wife think? - It's two in the morning, she'd think it was the honorable thing to do. - Well in that case, would you mind if I took a shower? I feel like a pig. - Please, don't compare yourself to so vile a creature. You're very beautiful. - Thanks. You got a nice voice. - Oh, well thank you too. (chuckling) This way. - Okay. (thunder crashing) (suspenseful music) Oh my god. No. No, this is so embarrassing, you see... You were in here such a long time and there was no response. I thought something had happened. (thunder crashing) I never felt anyone so alive. (laughing) - Just just, you're so provocative. - Thank you. - No no. (laughing) Just please, please, don't tease me. Please Heather. It's not funny. - Leave the lights on. Take your clothes off. - Oh. (laughs) Be gentle with me. - Oh, I will. (bird squawks) (yelps) - Did you let the bird out? - No. - Maybe there's an intruder in the house. - Do you think it's your wife? - Possibly. (suspenseful music) (bird squawks) Heather. Heather. Heather, are you all right? - Give me that. - You. - Us. - What do you want? - Where is she? - She? - [Luther] The bitch. - I told you my wife isn't at home. - She called us from here and said that you raped her. - But-- - Said you were doing all sorts of things a man's not supposed to be doing to a woman. - That's preposterous. My phones aren't even working. How dare you enter my home and accuse me. (gun clicks) - That's my girlfriend, man. - What girlfriend? This was a mistake. - [Luther] Yeah, man, you just made it. - [Bill] Felt anyone so alive. So vivacious. (cat growls) - William Theodore Fontaine, MD. Doctor, huh? - A surgeon. - Put it back. - Sure. (glass shatters) Think I need some piece of paper to tell me how smart I am? Quit acting so high on your high horse, huh? - Why? Just tell me why? - You must believe me, I treated her with the utmost respect. - Respect? - Respect, nasty little bitch. - Oh, what have I done? (sobs) Why? Just shut it off, will you? It's embarrassing? - Look, that bitch got a pimple on his butt. - Hey, it was just getting good, what'd you do that for? - Bill. What's your wife gonna say when she sees this? Or better yet, your daughter. Maybe your neighbors! - Please keep your voice down. What is it you want, money? All right. No no no no! I'm just trying to find my money, I keep my money in my jacket. Look. See, here we are. Just leave me alone, will you? That's all I have. - It's a start. Now get me the most expensive liquor you got. Hurry. - All right, all right. Just give me room, will you, give me room. - You watch your mouth, Bill. (thunder rumbling) - Stupid nigger. What? - [Jimmy] What I tell you about using that word? - [Luther] I ain't a racist, I mean, shit, I love spics, niggers. - Keep your... - How could you do this to me? I actually cared about you. - I'm sorry, Mr. Fontaine. - Bill. Don't talk to her. Hey baby. - Hey. - You did good. Give me a kiss. Where were you? - Hurry up over there, I'm thirsty. - I had to use the bathroom. - Oh shit. Yo, there's 95 Gs in this account. We're rich! What the hell is that? Get that shit out of my face, give me the whole bottle, man. - You can do better. - Bill, shut the fuck up, man. God damn. (slurping) (Heather groans) - The hell is this? Sheesh. - Get the fuck off your couch, Bill. (thunder rumbling) - Look, I'm not a rich man. - A Mercedes. A beautiful home. - I work hard for my money. - You don't call this work? - In the morning, go to your bank, withdrew $25,000 from your account, it's as simple as that. - Will I get the tape back? - You have my word. (laughing) (light music) Victor. It's Jimmy. We'll have your money today. - Good. When? - Maybe about two hours. We'll be down to your place. - One hour exactly, I'm a busy man, don't be late. - Not a problem. (speaking foreign language) Fucking asshole. (laughs) - Oh, whoa. Tell me I wasn't right Jimmy, tell me man. We scared the shit out that bitch, man. Shit, 25 Gs? Shit, I can't wait to throw it in Victor's face, man. Go to the bank, get two Gs out in pennies, that's what we're gonna do. - We ain't home yet. - Hey, don't burst my bubble man. - All right I'll tell you what. Why don't you take your turn in the Jacuzzi, I'll go downstairs and watch Bill, because obviously you can't handle it. (laughs) - Nah man, you trying that old reverse Scientology crap again, man. Not this time, bro, not this time. - Just so tired. - Just get me the video tape, my dear. I'd rather pay you the money. I don't trust them. (talking indistinctly) - Stupid bitch gonna try to pull the wool over my eyes? Fuck that. - [Bill] I think that basically you're a good person who's been taken advantage of. - Really? - [Bill] I care about you. - The food's burning. Oh god, I'm gonna be sick. - Heather, come back. (shouts) - Oh, sorry! - Bitch! (shouting) Sit the fuck down, sit down, shut up. Oh, fuck. - Jerk. - You burned the fucking bacon, man. Thought I told you to watch the food, bitch. - Don't talk to her like that. - I was talking to you, bitch. What's up with those eggs, anyway? I thought I told your English ass I wanted my eggs Benjamin. What were you two conspiring about in there? Huh? - Merely having a conversation. - [Luther] About what? - Look, just untie me and let me defend myself like a man. - Don't call yourself a man, you're not a man. - Please, I've got family. - So what? (vomiting) What are you doing? Oh my god, what... Lick it off! My brand new Bruno Mussolinis! What's wrong with her? - She's not feeling well. I've seen a lot of this at the hospital. It could be a mere case of the common cold, or perhaps she's suffering from influenza. - Nevermind that, where's the wash machine in this piece? Banish this stink. - Down in the basement, over there. (whistling) (water draining) - Yo, I can't see, where's the fucking light here, huh? I said where's the fucking light, man? (shouting indistinctly) Shit! Son of a bitch! Why don't you clean your fucking stairs, huh? You fancy prick. - Shit is this? You know what this shirt cost me? What are you doing? - See how you like it. - Psycho motherfucker. (shouting) About to take this whole motherfucking chamber to your cracker ass. - Please, please! - My god, you cut off my fucking thumb! (yelling) Where's my thumb?! (gun fires) (muttering) (whimpering) - Shit. - That motherfucker cut off my thumb, man. I'm in fucking pain, man. - You shoot him? - What about me, man? I'm outta contention, bro. My livelihood, my career. - I shoulda told you this before. I know you know the martial arts and everything, but you never really had a chance as a boxer, man. - What do you mean, man? - Did you shoot him? Oh shit, shit. Move your hand. - That barbarian friend of yours tried to kill me. - Heather baby. Come on. Wake up, girl. Are you all right? - I'm okay, Bill. - Bill? - Jimmy. I've seen her symptoms before. She's showing signs of a toxic infection. - What? - Give the bitch some Vagisil. She was supposed to watch my back. - Shut up, man. You tell me who's gonna go to the fucking bank now, asshole. - You got attitude, man. - Yeah well I can't go to the bank, someone's sure to suspect something. Will you just look at me? - I'll go to the bank. - I'll do what I can. This is not a hospital, I do not have my equipment with me. But just you keep on taking a drink, otherwise this is gonna be very painful for you. (yells) - You fucking bastard! - Keep still, will you? Just keep still. - All right. - Okay. - What kinda doctor are you? - I'm a proctologist. (yells) (light music) - Next. Deposit? - Cash. - Do you have an account here? - Nah. - Do you have any form of identification? (laughs) - I don't believe this. I forgot my wallet. Just call Mr. Fontaine. He'll verify everything. It shouldn't be a problem. - [Teller] Your name is? - Jimmy Best. - [Teller] Excuse me. Jimmy Best is trying to cash this check. He doesn't have an account, no identification. - It wasn't funny. - So? (suspenseful music) - I just tried to reach Dr. Fontaine, there isn't any answer. Are you aware that he terminated his account with us here yesterday? - But he just gave me the check this morning. - Mhmm. Well if you just hang on a second, I'll try Dr. Fontaine's work number. I'm sure it's just a slight misunderstanding. - I think I know what happened. He must've given my company the wrong check. It must be a different bank. Sorry for the inconvenience. - Oh, hang on, just a minute please. This could be a computer error. $25,000 cash? (suspenseful music) (shouting) - God damn! (whistling) Sit down. Sit down. Shut the fuck up. - He's an imbecile. A vulgar human being. - Yeah. Don't worry about him, he's harmless. Bill? Can I ask you a personal question? - [Bill] Of course. - Is it hard to be so smart? - No, of course not. You're very smart yourself. Maybe you've made a few bad decisions. But you're very beautiful. You know that, don't you? (Luther laughs) - You like that, fruity? That's a Benjamin, you fancy English prick, you. - [Heather] You're an idiot, Luther. - Heather. I have to tell you a secret. - What? - I'm in the midst of a bitter divorce. She's trying to get her claws into my money, but my attorneys, they're too smart for her. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. (sniffs) - Look, you know I can't breathe like this, will just untie me? I'm getting chest pains. - I really can't. - But my legs, you know, please loosen me, I can't feel my legs. Just loosen these bonds, please? - I'm sorry, but I really can't. - Please. I've done nothing to deserve this. I've treated you with nothing but respect. I'm a learned man. A doctor. I don't deserve this. (hip hop music) - Look at me when I'm jerking it, look at me when I'm talking to you, look at me. Watch my face. (sniffing) Can't you fucking knock? (yells) You son of a... You crazy bastard! (cracking) - What are you doing?! - Oh, actually this is not what it seems. He attacked me. I had to defend myself. (phone ringing) (beeping) - [Man] You've reached the Fontaine home. - [Heather] What do you mean? - [Man] Please leave a message at the beep. (beeping) - It's Jimmy. And I'm gonna make 500 copies of that fucking video tape and sell them everywhere! Why didn't you tell me you withdrew all your money from your account yesterday, you lying bastard! And now I got a flat! (horn honks) Fuck you! - What do you mean he went to the wrong bank? Is he gonna be okay? - What can you expect from such imbeciles. Forget them. They destroyed me and now that Jimmy person is destroying my car. - I'm going home. - What? No no no no no no no no. Will you just let me take you? I can't have you here when my wife comes back. Do me a favor, just change into something more sensible. For me? Please. (sighs) Good, good. I'll be right back. - Oh, hi there, yeah, I'd like to report a crime, it's very urgent. (suspenseful music) - It used to be a hell of a lot easier to fucking rip somebody off, I swear to god. Son of a bitch. What's next? (chattering on police radio) Typical. (moaning) (siren wails) Oh shit. (chattering on police radio) - What's the problem? - Got a flat. I just need a couple of minutes to fix it. - Well hurry it up, you got a lot of traffic there. - Could you do me a favor and call a tow truck? - For a flat? - I think my front end got screwed up. - Yeah, okay. Let's go. (horn honking) (muttering) - Get lost. - I'll fuck you up. (muttering) - Beat it! - All brothers are the same, once you reach the top. Let me at the jack. (muttering) (whining) - I'm sorry, man. I'm gonna get you to a hospital, I promise. - Yeah, I need for you to step out of traffic. I need for you to get out of traffic. - Cut yourself? - Yeah. It's no big deal. - Pretty nice car. You must have a good job. Make a lot of money, huh? - Eh. - Something wrong? - Tough day at the office. Ah. Could you give me a hand here? My fingers hurt. Could you help me with the jack? - Go get the tire ready. - I'll be right back. (dog whimpers) Scat. Get outta here, you little shit. (horn honking) - Excuse me, sir? You're gonna have to move your vehicle, there's no double parking here please. (dog whines) (dog yelps) - K9 division, 235 Main Street, I have a dog being dragged down Main Street. Driver is unaware in a green Ford Explorer... Forget these? - Thanks. - License and registration. - What for, man? - License and registration. You in some kind of rush? You forgot to take the car off the jack. Step outside the car and put your hands over your head, right now! Step outside, nice and slow. Where I can see 'em, that's it, open the door and step out. Nice and slow, keep 'em up in the air. - Okay, man. - Put 'em up! - Okay. - Turn around, hands on the car. - What'd I do, man? - Shut the fuck up. - Yo man, quit grabbing my dick. - You keep talking, cock sucker, and I'm gonna put this fucking bullet through your head. (horn honking) (yells) (suspenseful music) - They did not show. Make me wait for two hours, do you know what I could've been doing, you know what my time is worth?! - They weren't never gonna pay. - They're gonna pay. If not in greenbacks, then in blood. - We're gonna stick their heads where the sun shines, boss. - Suspect escaped on foot. Can't be far. - Good news, they got it all on tape. Suspect is a black male, bald, last seen headed south on Main. Black serial killer, that's a new one. - What, a black man can't be a serial killer? Affirmative action, it's a bitch. - Found the suspect's wallet. He's responsible for the disappearances of 15 people. (helicopter flying overhead) His name is Jimmy Best, no history of mental illness, no criminal record to speak of. He had three bodies in the trunk. Bill Fontaine, his wife and daughter, all dead. - Jesus. - Yesterday Mr. Fontaine went to the bank, he took out $95,000. He actually closed the account. Then Best went back to the bank trying to get more cash. - Greedy bastard. - That doesn't make any sense. - Who called 911? - The call came from the Fontaines'. But Best had a flat on Main Street at the time and the Fontaines were already dead. - An accomplice? - Yeah, apparently. But he made a lot of mistakes. Fingerprints, blood, hair, and someone's thumb. It's Caucasian, but none of the Fontaines were missing any digits. - [Detective] This guy's a poster boy for sexual deviancy. Drug addiction too, we found crack vials all over the house. Don't expect him to adhere to any set patterns. (cheerful music) (mumbling) (laughs) (singing) â™ª La la la la la la la (coughs) And this, my money. (laughs) And is full of... Nothing. No, no. It's gone. (muttering) My god, why me? Now I know there isn't a god. I always knew. Why! Why! Why! Why! Wake up! (gulls squawking) - Don't you even start with me today, bitch! I work like a fucking slave, I'm tired. Fucking starving, I got no gum, my dick's tied in a double knot. Place looks like a fucking mess. What the fuck you been doing all day hanging around in your pajamas? Another thing I realize, I don't need no goddamn GED to tell me how fucking smart I am. Good Enough Dummy bullshit. Do me a favor, will you make me a hot pot of coffee and some sausage links? - You really need to know how to start treating women. - You ain't no bitch! Why you dressed like Libida for? - Where's Heather? - You got the green? - Where is she? - How the fuck should I know, man? The crazy son of a bitch tried to rape me. - You got the tape? - Yeah I got the fucking tape, man. - Give it to me. - You don't got no fucking manners, man? Say fucking please? - Give me the fucking tape! - Here. - All right listen. Ain't got a lot of time. We gotta bounce. - I ain't fucking going nowhere, you crazy? - Luther. We got people after us. I'm gonna go in the bathroom and change, okay? Why don't you pack your shit and we'll get the fuck outta here. If you had more time maybe fucking clean up around here a little. This place looks like shit. - Freeze, motherfucker! (laughing) I gotcha, motherfucker! Don't motherfucking move! - So what they doing, huh? What's you doing, little anus? Why are you packing? Your little backdoor buddy was supposed to have met me three hours ago, huh? - 3:00, huh? - I don't like to wait! - [Luther] I was just cleaning up. - I didn't get no phone call. No fax, no page. No nothing. - Must've been some kind of mistake, I thought you guys got paid already. There's some kind of a screw up or something. - No, you're the screw up. - You were about to leave, and you were trying skip town, huh? - Don't judge a book by its pages all the time, man. I wasn't going nowhere. - Don't fucking look at me. - Under control. Now I've just about lost patience. Now if you don't produce some money, I'm going to cut off something, and it won't be your fucking thumb. (yelling) We'll check every fucking orifice if we have to. - Fuck. Okay okay, I got a brand new Mercedes, it's worth five times what I owe you. - Where's this Mercedes? - It's just for you. You should be kissing my nuts like they're fucking bon bons right now. (yelling) - I think I broke my hip. - Man, you gotta stretch first. - Jesus. - Dear, who stole my money? - What are you talking about? - Where are we, what am I doing in this car? - How can I trust you after all the lies you told me? - I'm not a liar, you're a liar. - I refuse to dignify that with a response. How dare you say that. How insulting. - Can you take me home? - You've got to understand, I'm under a great deal of pressure. My job, my wife, the divorce. I talked to her this morning. I gave her the house. Everything. Just so I could be with you. - You're crazy. (laughs) - I have money. We're financially secure. Anything you want is yours. - Will you buy me a fur coat? I always wanted a mink. Please? - Oh, you'll never believe this, I didn't bring any cards here with me. - What? You promised. You said that I could have anything that I wanted, and I want a mink. - Well, I'll get you a mink. Why don't we just take a look and pick one out for our next visit. Love, I just remembered, I need to make an important phone call to my lawyer. You go ahead and take a look, would you? (sighs) - [Reporter] Best was dishonorably discharged from the Marines. - Jeez. - [Reporter] He's made his way as a con man. He's considered extremely dangerous. It's believe he has an accomplice. - Look at this. - [Reporter] And believed to be carrying over $100,000 in cash and jewels. What you are about to see is extremely graphic. - I think they should fry that bastard. - I agree wholeheartedly with your opinion, young ladies. But your progressive country has grown too soft in dealing with these humanless beings. Excuse me. - I ain't afraid of no fucking serial killer. Shit. We killed what, 15 people last year? - 12. - Not that bad. Search this shithole. (suspenseful music) (phone ringing) - [Luther] Shut the fuck up. - One fucking word, you're gonna have your shit on their dicks. - [Luther] Yeah, what? - Have you seen the news? - [Luther] Who the fuck is this? - Who do you think it is? - [Luther] You're supposed to be dead. How'd you get this number? - Well, I'm not as stupid as you. Listen closely. Get me that tape and I'll let you keep half the money you stole. Don't forget-- - What money? You got the money, fruity. - Ask Jimmy. He has $100,000 of my money. Find him before the police do. Tell him I'm gonna kill Heather unless I get my money and that tape. - Think I give a fuck if you kill that dumb bitch? Go ahead, kill her. We'll make a deal and turn you in to the cops anyway. - What's my name? Where do I live? Where are my fingerprints? Sorry. I've got no record and no existence. But I do have Heather, and I can kill her quite easily. Just get him here with that tape. I'll cut you in on $50,000. There's a payphone at the corner of Hoyt and Monroe downtown. Be there at 10, I'll with instructions. By the way, I suggest you leave there as soon as possible. The police are bound to find you. I believe you left a thumbprint behind. - I think I left a whole thumb. - Well he seemed like a nice guy. Classy like. And I got a line on this English fag. Key to an easy 100 grand. Where do we find Best? - I know where he is, I can get him. - Good. - [Luther] But I gotta use the bathroom. - Oh, number one or number two? (urinating) - Can I get some privacy, please? - Privacy these nuts. (screams) - The fuck was that? Get in there! (yelling) Nothing better be happening upstairs! - Wow, they fucking played you, pussy. Get back, you fucks! - What the fuck is going on?! - I'll get 'em. - If you guys lose them, you're gonna be on the slow boat to Thailand. You have a fucking problem, you understand me? (screams) (suspenseful music) (tires squealing) - Yoko, it's Victor. What are you wearing? Tell me later, we need a ride. - Freeze! - And call in a lawyer. - On the floor! - So, you've never met Jimmy Best? - Who? - Jimmy Best. The suspect. We found your name in his wallet. - Well maybe I'm his next victim, asswipe. You should get some cops over to my house, I got a family. - Just tell me what you know about him, huh? - Well I've me the black kid a couple times. We gambled together, that's all. He stole 100 grand, right? - Where the fuck is the money? Now why you holding out on me? - I aint' holding out on you, man. - We're supposed to be a team, motherfucker. Let me tell you something man, between me and you, you know I wouldn't stick you wrong, man. But ever since you been banging that bitch bro, you got nothing but trouble. - Slow down man, slow down. - Talking all this crazy shit like you're gonna get a job and this and this and that. Society fucked you up. What's gotten into you? - What the hell were you doing, man? Jerking off? - Get off my back. I was ambushed, man. - You were supposed to watch her. - I aint accessible to no breakfast murders, you hear me? And another thing, that girl of yours is probably fucking that fancy English prick right now. (cheerful music) - Oh yes, hello, Mrs. Peckerwood. Simon Churchill here again. Simon Churchill, from Architectural Digest. - Oh yes, hi, how are you. Please be careful with this china in that box. - Yes I'm afraid my plans have changed, I'll be leaving the country sooner than expected. I'll need to come around tonight. - Tonight? - Yes. - We'd love to have you, yes, but the house isn't done yet. Well of course, anything, anything that you want. We're still renovating. (sighs) Okay. What time? 8:00, we'll see you then. Okay, bye bye. Oh god. Sid! That is an heirloom, please be careful, I want it right over there against the wall. You can do that, can't you? Okay. I need my hairdresser, I'm a mess. - 16 year old girl was raped and murdered. Luther Wright was at that house. You were at his house. That connects you with him. Now just tell me what you know about it, will ya? - Well he asked me to meet him there, I was interviewing him for a job. But if he is a rapist and a murderer, I'm probably not going to hire him. - Did you ever meet Bill or Grace Fontaine? - Oh no, are you going to introduce me? - We would. But they're dead. - Really. - You weren't a cripple I would kick your ass. (speaking foreign language) What? What's that? Huh? - Do you usually trash someone's house when you're about to hire him? - It was just a background check. - You know they don't have much sympathy in prison for cripples. - I think you owe my client an apology. Plus he answered all the questions of his own free will. - Go on, get the hell outta here. Hit the bricks. I want that brick. I think I'm losing my touch. - Hey now. Don't worry about it man, you're not losing anything. We'll get him. (suspenseful music) - Madam, how would you like to pay for that? - I think I want one more look. Wow. You have all this land? - Several hundred acres. - What are you doing? - Nothing. - Is this where you plan on building? - [Bill] Are you afraid of heights? - [Heather] No. - Do you know, I think I'm falling in love with you. - Come on, Mr. Fontaine. - Why do you tease me? And why are you stark naked? - Because it feels good. - I'd like to know if you took my money. I work hard for my money, and I want it now. - Ow! Don't you ever hit me again. And screw you and screw your money, okay? All you rich people are alike, all you care about is your goddamn money. - Let's just be civil here. If you didn't steal my money, how did you pay for the mink? - I used your credit card, you cheapskate. - Where'd you find my credit card? - In your house, where do you think I found it? - I never gave you permission. - Well if that's how you feel about it baby, take it. - No, no. Credit card. I don't need this. (sighs) - I didn't think it was such a big deal. - No, it really isn't. It's just that I care about you. Show the doctor your tongue. Now come on. Don't be shy. Yeah, just as I suspected. - [Heather] What? - You've got acute meningitis. - Is that bade? - Drink some Coke. It'll make you feel better. That's it. Another swig. - Yeah? - Yeah. - We ran a search on the Fontaines' credit cards. Somebody bought a mink at a fur store in the mall. - Break. - Check it out. - Luther Wright's rap sheet came in. Wright's been arrested for illegal gambling, grand theft auto, shoplifting. Oh, here's a nice one. Indecent exposure, pulling his pecker in a Jack in the Box restaurant. - Jimmy, I gotta tell you a secret. I can trust you, right? - Yeah. - I know I can trust you. You know that time I stuck up the Jack in the Box? - Yeah. - Sent my ass back to the pen, remember? This big scary cock monster looking motherfucker named... Coontacunt. Staked me for like his... His boyfriend. You can't tell nobody though, it's between me and you. You know how we do. I mean, X nothing like that. - Yeah. - I ain't going back, man. I ain't going back. (coughing) (opera music) - What a magnificent home, Mrs. Peckerwood. - Oh, call me Gwen. - Gwen. - I'm sorry about the appearance. - Well I'm tempted to steal it from you. Maybe you'd like to sell it to me before you finish up. (laughs) - No. No no no no no. We're gonna retire and spend the rest of our lives here. - Ah. - Simon Churchill. Any relation? - Great uncle. - God, how exciting. - Yeah, indeed. - Say, when did you say this article will be published? - Well not the next issue, but the one after that, if all goes as planned, which hopefully it will. Well, excuse me, so rude of me. - Oh please, don't be foolish. My husband's an occasional pipe man himself. - Oh. Thank you. - That's an interesting blend. - Yes, it's Colombian. (coughs) - Are you all right? - Yes. - Let me get you a drink. - Smashing. (playing Fur Elise) Oh, that's so beautiful. Like the ripples on the surface of the lake. - Look, no hands. (laughs) - You tricked me. Mrs. Peckerwood, tell me, surely you and your husband can't be the only occupants of this huge house. - Oh no. My son and his new bride are living with us. Until they get on their feet. You know how kids are these days. - No, I'm sorry, I don't. It's just that my daughter... Oh, nevermind. - What's wrong? - Well, quite recently, I lost my daughter. I'd give everything I have to get her back. - [Gwen] I'm so sorry. - Nothing I could do, I tried everything. Best money could buy. And you know I can't help thinking that possibly I was the one to blame. - Oh Simon, you're not to blame. Anyone would've done the same in your position. - You're so very kind. You're a wonderful woman. A pip. (laughs) - Would you like to meet my husband? - Yes. I'd be honored. - I'll be right back. Sid! Where are you? Come on down. - Gwen. You actually paid cash for this place? - Excuse me? (screaming) - Gwen? (suspenseful music) Gwen? Gwen, where are you? Gwen? - Hello. Simon Churchill, at your service. (phone ringing) (moaning) - No I don't. This is wrong, I can't do this. Forgive me, Heather, for my thoughtlessness. I love only you. (crying) - Like blood and shit, man. (rap music) (siren wailing) - Let me see that, man. (dialing phone) Oh my god. - Hey boss? (rap music) - Look at you. I love you. - All right man. Come on. - No man. I really love you man. We gonna go down together, we ain't going down one on one man, we going down together, man. - All right man. - We've been together through some tough-- - All right. God damn. - All right. - This is the last shit I need right now. - It ain't nothing like that. (opera music) - Let me inform you of the real reason for my visit here. It's to make a small withdrawal from your bank account. Hmm hmm hmm. (mumbling), Mr. Peckerhead. Now, Sidney, I want the money. I want you to go to your bank and take out all the money you've got and give it to me, it's as simple as that. Any mistakes, and I will not hesitate to kill your lovely wife. (crying) And children, in the most painful way possible. This recent excitement has made me careless. This is a lovely stone. So? Sidney, do we, me and you, do we have a deal? - You fucking madman! I won't give you a fucking cent, you son of a bitch! God damn you! - This one's for you, Sidney. - Kiss my ass, you son... (yells) - You see? You see what you made me do? - God damn you, god damn you... (dog barking) (sniffing) - Mmm, roses. I love roses. Mmm. Ow! Jesus, Bill, there are thorns in these. At least you could've taken out the thorns! - Here, here. Here, here, here, oh no. Let me help you. Is there nothing I can do that will please you? - No. Just take me home, okay? - We are home. - My god. It's like a dream. - Yes. It is a dream. And it's ours. (Heather laughs) Here, give me your hand. I want you to marry me. - Are you serious? - Would I lie? - Bill, it's so beautiful. (playing piano) - And darling, will you love me for long? You know, I wrote this for you. - It's beautiful. How much did this cost you? (piano playing Fur Elise) (rap music) - Hey! You been on the phone for over an hour! Please hurry? - Get that fat ass back to work already, all right? Go suck somebody off or something. - Why don't you go suck your own dick, you little shit. - You know if I could do that, I wouldn't leave my fucking house, would I? (cheerful music) - Bill. Where are my servants? I'm starting to get hungry. - I'm baffled. They should be here. Love, I've got a multitude of logistics to deal with. I'd like to start planning the wedding. (laughs) I'll be right back. (busy signal beeping) - [Luther] Come on, hurry up, I gotta use the phone. - [Woman] You gotta wait like everybody else. - This is my phone, see that? Luther. I would not like to smack the shit out of you right now, but I will if I have to. Can I get the fucking phone, please? (busy signal beeping) - You're not getting the phone. - You one of those like dominatrix types, them Miss FTSS bitches, huh? (dialing phone) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Jimmy? - [Jimmy] Heather. Where are you, are you with Bill? - Yeah, well that's what I wanted to talk to you about. - He's a murderer. Get outta there. - [Heather] Aww Jimmy-- - [Jimmy] Get-- - Don't call him names, I didn't call to fight. - [Jimmy] Just leave, I don't care what you think, get away from him. - I don't want to fight, Jimmy. (suspenseful music) - I'll tell you one last fucking time. - What are you trying to do to my woman, man? - Do me a favor man, tell this bitch to get off the phone? - Just leave, I don't care what you think. Get away from him. - There's something that I really need to talk to you about. I'm really confused and-- - Just listen to me. - You want this down your throat? I'll pistol whip you. How's about some cock up your ass? - You got me all wrong, sir. I was just trying to get a piece of action. - Better go on the other side of town with your balls hanging out, that's more your style anyway. Slut, get outta the car! - Everything about him is a lie. He's not rich, he's not a doctor, he's a lunatic! Don't be stupid! - I'm not stupid, you're stupid. You're just jealous because he can take care of me and you can't. - [Jimmy] Heather, just listen to me. He's a psycho. (splashes) - Asshole. - Heather. I just closed a marvelous deal on a honeymoon in Maui. Aren't you pleased? - I'm gonna count to three. Either your ass is out of the car or you're one dead black whore. Get outta the car! Good. Now-- (shouting) - The basis of any relationship is to be able to trust one another. I'd like you to drink it. It's not gonna hurt you. - Heather called. She's still with him. I tried to tell her he's a nut. She didn't believe me. Well you got any ideas? - Wait for fucking Bill to call. (yells) I got an idea. Star-69. - [Jimmy] Good idea. (beeping) - [Gwen] Hello, you've reached 555-8324, the home of Gwen and Sidney Peckerwood. - They're at some fruity's house, Peckerwoods' house. Hello, hello, hello, I know there's nobody here right now, but we're looking for our money, bitch. (beeping) What you chuppakata looking ass bitches looking at, huh? Come on. Back to work. - They're leaving, they're leaving man! - Get up, bitch! - Relax, baby. - Holy shit. - I had a horrible nightmare last night. I dreamt I was falling and falling, and I thought I'd never stop, but then suddenly you were there to catch me. I see a bright future ahead of us. (coughs) - Oh, Bill. I really like you, and I think you're a great guy. And I'm really sorry about everything. But I... - You know, I really do love you. - I know you do. But I think you should reconsider your divorce. - Whatever for? I left my family for you. I can't possibly go back. I want to do what's right for me. Spend the rest of my life with a woman I love. This is a big home. There's plenty of room for children. - Bill, there's something that you have to know. - Drink this, it's full of herbs and vitamins. It'll make you fertile. - I'm not thirsty, Bill. Look, you're making this really hard for me. - Please, Heather, I insist. - Are you senile? I told you I'm not thirsty! - Now you just watch your tone with me, young lady. I think someone's in need of a lesson in etiquette. I can't have you embarrassing me in public again. Especially as now we're going to be living in high society. - Look Bill, I'm pregnant already, okay? I've been trying to tell you all along, but you just don't listen, and I love somebody else, so I can't marry you, okay? - I refuse to believe that. - Believe it. - God. I feel like such a fool. Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would've purchased a bassinet or maybe even a little doll for you. Here. (shouts) I'm gonna choke you till that little bastard pops out of your ass. (coughing and gagging) (screams) (cheerful music) (drum beating) (screaming) (urinating) (screaming) - Jesus. (moaning) Hail Mary, mother of grace, pray for our sins. (screams) (gun firing) (yells) (crying) (screams) (gun fires) - It's me! God dammit! - Oh my god, Jimmy! - Put the fucking gun down! - Oh Jimmy, I'm so sorry. I'm really happy to see you, I love you. - Yeah. - Oh god. Mommy! - Shh. Yeah. - We got him trapped. - Okay good. Just don't fucking touch him, you understand me? I got something special saved for these guys. - Tell him that we're gonna flush them out. - You tell him. - We're gonna flush them out, boss. - First... Hello? He hung up on me. Yoko, I'm sending your brothers back, you understand me? I'm sending them back. - Be quiet. - What? - I'm driving. Okay? - I'm sorry sweetie. - Everyone freeze, mother fuckers! (coughing) - I'm gonna kill you. You castrated my fucking thumb! (suspenseful music) - Ow! Fuck! - What wrong? - Fucking glass. - Quit fucking around, man. (speaking foreign language) - [Luther] My leg. - Take this gun and put it in Bill's hand. - Jimmy, help me please. I'm gonna die. I'm dying man, dying! Can't feel my legs, man! - I'll take care of the cops. I got the tape of Bill. - [Luther] Listen to me, man. - Jimmy. When I called you that time, you know? I was trying to tell you that I'm pregnant. - [Luther] Help me! - I promise I'll get my shit together. - So, you think you're funny, trying to make us look bad, huh? - Anybody move, and I kill 'em. Drop it slut. Throw it on the ground, slut! - Don't call me a slut! - Slut. - Slut. - Don't let 'em call you slut. Shoot him! - Leave me alone. - Put it down. Where'd you get that ring? (crying) - I told you, man! I told you! - No, shut up, Luther. - I'm gonna count to three. - [Heather] No! - Three. - Shoot 'em! - Just put it down. - [Kam] Two. - You're pregnant. - One. (laughing) All of you are pussies. (laughing) (gun fires) (gun fires) (shouts) (gun fires) (gasps) - Oh god. - Baby, you gotta get outta here. Where'd you get that coat? - I'm sorry, baby, I don't want it anyway. - Just get out of here, just get out of here. I love you. - [Heather] I love you. - Get outta here! What did you guys get fucking engaged or something? Huh? - [Heather] No! - [Luther] Jimmy, Jimmy. - [Bill] Hello gentlemen. - Get the fuck outta here, get the fuck outta here. - I want a house like this. - Why the fuck are you looking at me? (screaming) - [Yoko] Victor! (gun firing) (shouting) (laughs) - Oh, it's my tape. Thank you. You got my money? - No. I'm sorry. - Oh, fuck it. (shouting) (sirens wailing) (Luther whimpering) - Fuck you! (gun clicking) - [Luther] What are we gonna do now, Jimmy? (mumbles) - Victor Jefferson LaQuois, you have the right to remain silent, anything you do and say can and will be used against you in a court of low. - Ray. - You also have the right... Yeah, I got it. You also have the right to consult an attorney before speaking to the police. - Ray. I think he has to be conscious. (suspenseful music) - Kill me, motherfucker, kill me! (dog barking) (knocking) (doorbell ringing) - Oh honey, I'll get it. - No no no no no, I'll get it. You sit down, you eat, you stay and eat your breakfast too. Hello? - Hi, good morning. Let me introduce you to the wonders of the new Corona vacuum cleaner. (gasps) - [Boy] Who is it, Mommy? - Is that the little bastard? (cheerful music) â™ª La la la la la la la la (suspenseful music)
