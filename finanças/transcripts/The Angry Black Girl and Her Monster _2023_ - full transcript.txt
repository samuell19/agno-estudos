Death is a disease. I heard my mom's heart stop when I was 8. My mom's last heartbeat. A few more years and she would have been a doctor. A five-year plan broken with the one bullet. The disease spread. It infected my brother, Chris. He grew up and started banging with Kango. I thought that'd be the last of it. To support us, my dad is a mechanic in the day and security at night. He started showing symptoms after my brother died. Death is the disease that broke my family. I'm sick of seeing it. My hypothesis. If death is a disease... ...then there's a cure. And I'm gonna find it. Fuck. The Mad Scientist! The Mad Scientist! -How'd I get that name? -H! Um... H. Come on. You know it. -H? -Yes. Oh. Hydrogen. - Yes. - Yeah? Co. Co. Oh, that's a -- I don't know Co. Um... -Cobalt. -Yes! Yeah? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hey, yo, V. When you coming through? Uh, this afternoon. Oh, all right. Yo, you tell her to call me The Mad Scientist? I don't know nothing about that. Jada, we got to go soon. Can't you see? I'm busy. Pt. Uh, platinum. Sg. - Seaborgium. - Ti. Titanium. Help me with my homework again. Ca. Calcium. Got you. Aah! Got you! I won! - Little homey. - What's up? What up, though? Champ, what's good? - Cm. - Curium. U. Um...Hmm. Do I have to give you the answer? - Uranium. - Yes. Hey, yo! Kango-head ass. Yerr. What up, Jamaal? Curt, what's good? Yeah. We got that work. Yo, Curt, go grab that. - I. - Iodine. - Fe. - Iron. Cr. Mm. I don't know that one. Which one? -Cr. -Cr. Uh... Can you give me a hint? I don't really know how to give you a hint. The only hint I can give you is -- Oh, wait. I got it. Chromium. -Right? -Yes! How do you know all this? It's because I study great minds like Valerie Thomas. Who's that? Well, she's a physicist that invented -- Shoot. She's a physicist that invented the illusion transmitter, a mechanism that simulates a 3-D viewing of an object using optical illusions with parabolic mirrors at NASA. Tell your sister to tell you about Alice H. Parker, the inventor of central heating. Or Sister Rosetta Tharpe, the inventor of rock 'n' roll. Do you think you're smart 'cause you go to that white school? Well, that white school is smart because I go there. They only talk about Einstein and Edison at school. Maybe that's because we need better schools. It's not like Edison invented shit. Learn from the greats. All of them. Not some dude who just watches people make ideas and then patents them. Test me later. You have ketchup on your glasses. No. No, no. Jerome, no! Open the door. -What's the code? -Go on. No. No. Come on. -What's the code? -So you're not late for school. I'm serious. I don't want your mom tripping. Don't worry about her. And what's that smell? Hey! Hey. Who did that to you? Hmm? Don't worry about it. I'll make his heartbeat stop. You know what happens when a heartbeat stops? He stops breathing? Oxygen in your blood doesn't reach the brain. The brain fails in minutes, resulting in death. Say you hit the head. The brain controls all functions of the body. Destruction of the frontal lobe inhibits all personality, body movement, and intelligence. All sense of touch, vision, hearing, and memory vanish. Who wants to know all the different ways to die? Life is cheap. You know that. Do you really want to know I know all the ways someone can die? Just open the door. I'll tell you. Come here. It's 'cause I have bodies in there. I got living ones...dead ones. I open them up... see what's inside. Then I put them back together again to try and bring them back to life. You're the body snatcher. "To examine the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death." Aah! Jerome, I'm just messing with you. Come on. Hey. Wait. Let me see that. Get off me. Come here. Look at me. The mind and body, they're beautiful things, Jerome. Don't waste or destroy them. Who's stopping someone from destroying minds? Exactly. Now, the problem with the cancer cells is once it begins to metastasize, it's almost incurable because -- There are over 100 different types. That is right, Vicaria. However, if you -- Kill cancer stem cells, we can prevent other cancers from coming back. Thank you. But -- But that won't really work since it adapts under pressure and learns how to survive under stress. -Do you have a question? -No. Okay. Moving forward with the lesson. I mean, but I do have a theory. What is it? Cancer is not a disease. It's a symptom. Symptom of what? Death. That's a little morbid for the morning, don't you think? I mean, it really isn't any more morbid than leukemia. Death isn't a disease. -Care to explain why? -Because it's not. The human body is just as dynamic as any cancer. I mean, if it never broke down, it never died... - Stop interrupting. - ...it wouldn't need help fighting off the cancer cell. I mean, listen to me for like a second, okay? That's why death is the disease. Are you kidding me right now? I need security at Room 10H, please. -Okay. Come on. -Thank you. I gave you a warning. Yeah. That wasn't a warning. I'll tell you what. You can go to detention yourself or you can wait to be escorted by an officer. It is your choice, Vicaria. It is Va-car-ia, not Vie-care-ia. I'll call you Vicki, because it's much easier. If you look right down to the nucleolus, you will see the same exact... Well, if you get to call me whatever you want, I guess I'm just gonna call you Ms. Bitch from now on. Get out of my classroom right now. Stand up. Get her out of my classroom. Let's go. I said let's go. - Let go of me. - Get up. -Let go. -Stop. -Get up! Come on! -Get off of me. Thank you. Thank you for coming in today. I'm sorry if it was any inconvenience. You know, I was thinking. Your last name, it's so beautiful. It sounds European. Where are you from? Yeah. Your daughter has a very disturbing obsession. What obsession? Death. Death. It's all she talks about in my classroom. She's been obsessed with it. She thinks she can cure it. No. I know I can cure it. I am not afraid of my ideas. I just think time would be better spent on something that she could actually do. Maybe an alternative school would be a better fit for her. My daughter doesn't need no continuation school. She's missing tests and assignments, and there is only so much extra credit I can -- She takes the tests, the assignments, extra credit, whatever. She got that. And I will continue to encourage my daughter to think outside the box. Who do we talk to about her college? I believe Mrs. Padilla in the career center can help her make a plan. Ms. Padilla. What I need from you is to not call the goddamn cops on my daughter whenever you have a little petty disagreement. That's the child. Not you. Teach, lady. Teach. Come on, baby. Oh. And since you're so curious, our last name is German because some overseer probably branded one of my ancestors with his last name. Don't ever let them touch my daughter again. Come on. Come on. Okay, Chris. I got you. Come on. It's been a while, but you're gonna be okay. I got you, Chris. I got you. You'll be back soon. Mm-hmm. So, wait. Did he find out about you missing classes? Does your mom know that you're helping me out? No. You already know. I mean, he's using again, so... I told you. Don't even worry about it, girl. He's thinking about your brother. He didn't even have the chance to bury him. Like, he shouldn't have to. -We shouldn't have to. -I know. I just wish I could catch that sick fuck who took his body. You and I both know Chris wasn't the only body that went missing, V. Ooh! Hey. That's a Little Chris move for his Auntie V. You feel him? Boy. Do we know his name yet? Stop asking me. -You know I'm not telling. -Why? I promised Chris I wouldn't say it until the baby's born. You know my loyalty to him. -I don't care about your racket. -Bitch. Freeman! Don't call your sister no bitch. When you call her a bitch, you call all of us one. That's me, Mama, and Grandma. Is that what you want? -No. -Get out of here. Come here. Go study the alphabet. Without an attitude. A. B. C. D. E. F. -She about to get popped. -G. -She know it. -H. Stop playing with me, little girl. -I. J. -Girl, you're ready. L. - Five-0. Five-0. - Get down! Hey, Kango, let's roll. - Shit. - Get off me! - Fuck y'all niggas. - Get the fuck off me! Hey, step back. -Shit! You shot him! -Back the fuck off me, man! -Get the fuck off of me! -Fucking pig! You shot my little nigga! What the fuck, man? Dad. What happen, V? The fuck you do? - Requesting backup. - You shot a kid, man! You shot a goddamn kid! What the fuck he could've possibly did to you? The rest of you, get back! Hey, yo, J, back up. Back up. You pussy-ass niggas don't know where the fuck they at. Seal off the edge of the parking lot. Come on. Let's get the boys, man. They shot Jerome. 117 is gonna move out. Go ahead and make a hole for him. Everybody back. Everybody over here, move back. Give us space and let us work. Hey. Get back. You hear me? Give them space. Clear. All right. You heard him. Everybody stand back. Charge. Clear. Stay with me, little man. Charge. Clear. Come on. Chris? Holy shit! I did it! Oh, my God. Holy shit. Chris? It's Vicaria. I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not gonna hurt you. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I'm gonna show you who killed you. And I'm gonna show you what's killing our dad, okay? Yo, what the fuck are you doing? Whoa. Vicaria? -Who the fuck is you -- -Yo, Curtis. No. You stay. Move, nigga. I said move. No! Chris, stop! Hey, yo, Curt. Shit. Curt! Hey. - Help me! Please! - Hey, yo! Go get them, man! Shit. Shit. Right here. Right here. Go down there and check. Fuck! All right, man. Let's circle back. We need to check on Curt. Come on, man. Let's roll! -Yo. -Walk, little nigga. Man, walk. Get off of me. Who was with you? Where the fuck my shit at? Jamaal said he seen you running away. What, you hardheaded like your brother? Fuck you, Kango. - Hey, yo. Chill! - No, man. We don't know if Curt gonna make it. Relax, nigga! Look here, nigga. Let's just set the record straight. I ain't kill your brother. -You sent him down there. -He his own man, ain't he? Is that really how you feel? You still ain't answered my question. Who was with you? That's all right. You ain't got to say shit. My niggas gonna raise him. But see, now, me and you, we got a problem. 'Cause you know you done fucked up, right? Now, your ass lucky Curt ain't dead. Otherwise, this shit could've went real sideways. But you already know that, don't you? Now, why Jada be running around here calling you some type of mad scientist or shit? - Ain't that right? - Yeah. That's that shit. I mean, I got a lab for you. Whole little chemistry set, too. You can get busy in there, do your little tables and whatnot. And I mean, since you ain't saying shit, I guess you're cutting for me now. Hey, yo! Death come quick around here. Hey. Little nigga. -Come roll with me real quick. -Okay. Wait. Where we going? Time to work. What you mean? Come on. Okay. Can I change clothes first? Damn. Get off of me. Sit. I'm not helping you cut poison. All right. Just tell us where your boy at and you ain't got to. -I don't know where he is. -Ah. So there is somebody. God. No. I'm -- You like rice? Me personally, I love rice. It's cheap, plentiful. It's kind of like synthetics. Cheap and can feed a whole family. Now, too much of that shit, and, I mean... ...it all fall apart. You want to know how much is too much? Just the size of a small grain of rice. See, I'm gonna need you to remember that when you're cutting my shit, yeah? My niggas will find your boy. What are you gonna do if you find him? Shh. How about you just focus on cutting, measuring, and bagging? Keep that little bougie-ass attitude to yourself, yeah? Pick it up. Pick it up. See? Hey! Don't be slamming my fucking door! Hawaiian-shirt-ass nigga. Shit. Stop there and get your ass on the ground! Now! Freeman, Ma doesn't want me teaching this to you because she thinks you're too young. But they killed Emmett Till when he was just two years older than you. And you know what them folks say. You want to hide something from a nigga, you put it in a book. But this. Do you see this? The truth. This is your real history. They out here fighting to keep true history out of schools so they can keep teaching you the fake shit. But Columbus wasn't nothing but a human-trafficking rapist. Now go on. You ready to move on to reading? Can I practice my alphabet a little more? Okay. But this is the last day. Yay. More learning. Can I hang out with my friend after? What friend? Chris. Yeah, but only after you finish. Okay. A. Who's her friend? Girl, I don't know. Probably a new tenant. So, what's up? You helping me out? C. Hello? You helping me out or what? Come on. You can do it. Uh, yeah. Yeah. Uh, look. You keep missing this part about ions. Nigga, what's up with you? I seen you on the block hanging out with Kango. -You know it. Come on. C. -You're not mixed up in that? -No, I'm not. I'm not. -Chris wouldn't want that. -You better not be. -Aisha, I'm not. All right. I just don't want you caught up. -I told my mom about your dad. -What? She wants to have y'all over for dinner. And maybe it's good for him to get around family. Look, I want my kid's grandfather in his life. So what, you coming or not? Yeah. Fine. I'll come. I'll see about him. While you see about him, a girl got to pee -- for two. This little nigga tap-dancing on my bladder. Fucking nasty. Come on. You can do it. L. M. N. O. P. Q. R. S. T. U. -V. -Who is that? You scared him. Jada, scared who? You know who. Jada, who was that? Jada. Chris. You saw my brother? Did you tell anyone? Where did you see him, Jada? - Hey. - Let go of me! Kango been looking for you. Let's go. Come on. You ain't been showing up to put in work, and I'm tired of looking for you. Who the fuck you think you is? You know, Curtis still in the hospital. All he do is scream about what he saw. You know, I didn't believe him until I seen your nigga. Yeah. I seen him. And I would have got him if the cops wasn't there. But he got away. Kango don't believe it, but I'm gonna prove it to him. You better pray that Curtis don't die. Or I'm gonna dead you like I did that cop. You know you're fucking with my family structure, right? Don't give me that shit. You've been messing with mine. Kicking that shit to my daddy. Addiction is an emotional issue, not a substance one. Think about it. If there were more mental clinics around here instead of police precincts, I'd probably be in a different job. Whole different hustle. Like what? I mean, Kango, really. What would you -- What would you really be doing? Huh? What, Kango? Huh? What hustle? Huh? King of the throne. -Fellas. -What would you be doing? Y'all niggas remember when her daddy came to me? I mean, he was practically begging for it. Pleading. Hell, I almost forgot he had a daughter the way he kept talking about his baby boy. Looked like the nigga was about to off himself. So yeah, I gave him that shit. That's not true. I'm the one that's keeping your fucking family alive! You got something else to say? Get to work. See you tomorrow. Follow her. - Boo! - Jesus. J, this isn't funny. I'm serious. Chris isn't in here. How do you know? Maybe he's waiting for you. Okay. Where? Behind you. Okay. Vicaria. V? V?! V?! V! What's wrong? I saw something. It was over there. No, no. No, Dad. There's no one there. I don't know who that was. Whoever it was, you scared them off. They're gone. It's okay. I got to go see if somebody out there. No. No, no. I'm okay. I'm okay. I swear. Okay. All right. Get some rest. It's all right. Okay. Mom, I'm hungry. Me too, baby, okay? Just wait. Have you seen Malcolm X's book, Jada? Chris took it. Jada, enough with the imaginary friend. He's not my imaginary friend. He talks to me. Jada, stop it. You know what? This close. Y'all come to the table. Hey. - Who is it? - Donald. He talks to you? Okay. Stay away from him. -Why? -He's dangerous. No, he's not. Jada, just do it. I'm gonna see a lot more of you around here when our grandchild arrives. Of course. Busting down the door like you're the police. Sorry, sweetheart. Sit down so we can eat. Okay. Ooh. All right. You gonna say the grace? Come on. Lord, thank you for this food and bless the hands that prepared it. - Amen. - Amen. All right, y'all. Dig in. This looks amazing. Aisha, you want some of this? Does anybody want some of this? So, how's school? Ms. K raised my grades after you talked to her. And your other classes? It's good. Even with your truancies? Mm-hmm. You've been taking advantage of your dad working double shifts. And we know you cover for her. Calling into the school, acting like somebody's guardian. Well, um, I'll have a 3.9 before the end of the semester. Yeah. And she's helping me raise my biology grade, so... Mm-hmm. -That's good. -Yeah. Just don't lie to us. He's got another pair of eyes now. -Yes, Dad. -Yes, Mom. I even heard about Ms. Kempe asking y'all where you're from. Negroes been here just as long as them folks, and they still act confused when they see us. Longer than them. We just left after we visited. - Okay. You're hotepping. - I ain't hotepping. We got to know who we are, V, Miss PWI Princess. "I'm gonna bring Jesus back from the grave, cure death." Shut up, Aisha. You want to cure death. Then what? -What you mean? -What happens after that? We get a second chance at life. What's the point when them folks still active? We can't do nothing dead. The system traps us if we're alive. -Fuck the system. -Hey. That system that you don't give a fuck about. Aisha! That system that you don't care about. -Go on. -Been robbing us of our culture, our name, our identity, our history. They got us out here killing each other, V, not knowing who we are. -You got your way. I got mine. -Fine. Then say less. V, you can take in more than one idea. Think about it. What if both of y'all are right? -No. -No. You're doing good. You still got family here. I just want to see him again. I'm gonna get it right. Right. I know it's hard with you working double shifts. You too, Miss Lady. V. Don't worry about that. Jada did that. I know I'm not the same. It's so hard trying to be there for you when I failed Chris. It's not your fault, Dad. I'm gonna get this right, baby. I promise you. I ain't gonna let you down. You never have. He's been watching you, body snatcher. He's here. -Who is it? -No. Freeman. - This is the police. - Oh, shit. Get away from the door. Yes? We're investigating the murder of an officer! Can you open the door, please?! No, we cannot. Have you seen any suspicious activity? No, we have not. What'd I tell you? Don't open the door unless I know who it is. If them folks ask where you're going, what do you say? That I'm going home. - What else? - My name. Man. Hm. -Sorry. -Thank you. You did good. Mm. Don't let them racketeers ruin the meal. What did Chris use to call them? Racketeers, right? I know it's hard to talk about him, but it's good to remember the happy times. Death always got to be so tragic. It's racket busters. Racket busters. No. Dad, don't. Do not. - The racket busters! - Don't. Stop. You sound corny. Hey, don't let the racket busters ruin the meal! You sound corny. You got one for me? Racket busters. No, no. This is for your brother. This is for your brother right here. -Put some on it, now. -Okay. Okay. Okay. Racket busters! All right. You ready? The racket busters. Yay! That's my baby girl. Hey. Can you top that? Racket busters. -You have to get up in here. -Racket busters! You sound like a white woman, but you're all right. -Hit it for me. -Racket busters. She put her neck in it. She put everything. Put her foot up in that one. R-R-Racket! I love you, Dad. I love you too, baby. You know you had to get in there. Hey, pal. Where you headed? He fits the description. Home. See...my...father. You feeling all right tonight, sir? Put your hands behind your back for me, okay? I'm Chris. You're not Chris. You're the monster who kills cops. Hey! Hey, sir! Sir! Stand down! Oh, shit. You got him. You got him. Jesus Christ. Did you see that? I think it's him. I got a -- I have a monster out here. Monster. Man, what the fuck do you want? -I need to see Kango. -That nigga not here. -Little nigga, I swear to God. -Fuck you, Jamaal. Vicaria? Hello? V? Yo. What's g-- What? Hey! Uh-huh. All right. I found your drugs. Now, stay away from my family. I'm done. But what about your boy? Chris? Chris. Where you been? Everybody said you was... was dead. Chris. Father. You ain't Chris. No. You know what I heard on the phone? Curtis is dead. While her nigga gave me this. Jamaal. You said it'd go the other way if he didn't make it. -He ain't here no more. -Jamaal. So why the fuck is she still standing there? Keep your voice down. Now, let her the fuck go. -You heard me. -No. She don't get off that easy. You better remember who the fuck you're talking to. -Her nigga almost killed me. -Yeah. I know that. You won't believe me when I tell you what it looked like. -I told you I believe you. -And it's right here! You get out of here. You're just gonna side with her. Oh, shit! Fuck. No! V! No. No. Dad? Dad. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No! Get away from me. Get away from me! Get away. I said get away! That's him. I told you. -That was him, wasn't it? -Yeah. -Huh? -Yes. Tell me what the fuck that nigga's -- -It's hard to explain. -Nigga, get that -- It's Chris. That shit wasn't Chris. That shit looked dead. Who do you think moved the body? What the fuck are you talking about? Look. I wanted to cure death. I had to get as many bodies as I could to make Chris look like his old self. You used dead Black bodies for that shit? You're the fucking body snatcher! You can't fucking judge me. Look at what you do. I know your ass always want to blame me for some shit, but I'm not out wilding for the fuck of it! I ain't make no fucking monster! I got to put a -- I got to put a stop to it. -Shit. -No. -No. I need him alive. -Are you crazy? I need him alive so I can see what would happen with him. -How the fuck do I kill it? -Him. -It. -Him! That shit ain't Chris and you know it! -Get it through your head. -Okay. You sold my daddy that poison. -You killed Chris. You did that. -Shut the fuck up! This wouldn't have happened if you'd just left him alone. But he had to put his hands on his family. I mean, the gun was never meant to be a tool of death. They used to make beautiful fireworks in China with it. -Shut the fuck up! -When Einstein made his equation to unlock new sources of energy... -Quit the science shit. -...they took that, and they -- -Can you just shut the fuck up? -Let me fucking finish! They took that, and they made death. All I wanted to do was fucking cure it. I didn't mean for this to happen. I didn't mean for this to happen. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck! Come on! Come on! Okay! Okay! Fuck. Okay. Okay. We need to kill this thing. Now. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm thinking. I'm thinking. -Before it kills somebody else. -Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I did -- I did build it. I-I built it, so... so if I -- if I hit it with enough electricity, then -- then maybe its body will go down. -Maybe what? Come on. -Look. Look. It's a theory. There are no guarantees, okay? I just -- I need my tools. Wait? Where the fuck are the tools? -One is in my lab. -Where's the lab? -It's, um... -Come on. It's the other side of the complex, okay? It's through the green alleyway. It's next to an abandoned unit. Okay? And the other one? It's in my room. We got to go the fuck back out there with that thing? Kango -- Kango, we need both. Fuck! Shit! Please. Please. -Come on! -Okay. -Go! -Okay. Okay. You really just cheat death. What? I shouldn't have never sent Chris to kill them niggas. Go prep your lab. -I got the rest. -Okay. Remember. It's on my desk. It's metal. It's wired with antennas. -Go! -Okay. Shit. Come on. Come on. Come on. Shit. Jada, how did you find this place? Okay. No. You need to go home. It's not safe for you to be here, okay? Oh, my God. What happened to you? Jada. Jada, what happened? -I saw Chris. -Hmm? He's coming. Come on. Come on. Come on. Chris showed me this place. Jada, go back inside, okay? I told Chris who his family was. Jada! And when you came over for dinner, I showed him. Jada, I'm serious, okay? Go back inside. I showed him to his father. Something happened when he was out there, because he came back different, Vicaria. What? Okay. Jada, it's not safe. You can't stay here. I'm serious. Oh, my God. Kango. No. I'm...a... monster. My name... monster. No. You're Chris. You're my daddy's son. My mother's child. Who taught him how to talk? I did. Why did he hurt everyone? They called him a monster. Them folks did. And he believed it. They made him one, Jada. Can you bring our family back like you did to Chris? What do you mean, bring them back? Our family. Can you bring them back? When Chris came back, no one believed it was Chris. Not even Aisha. They attacked him. You can bring them back. I know you can. Jada, it won't work. I saw Chris walk again after he died. Because of you. You saw what happened with Chris. Them folks ruined my idea. They... Not just your idea. Remember what your dad said? What Aisha said? Jada...I can't. You mean...they're gone? I'm sorry. Jada? Jada. Jada, look at me. They were just here. What'd you say? They were just here. They're still fresh. What? Jada... ...they're still fresh. No. No. No, no. Can you hear me? Where am I? What's your name? Victor -- Is he okay? No. I-I need to hear your real name. It's Aisha. Shut up. He's alive! He's -- He's really alive. He's alive. Victor. Chris wanted to name him after you. Aisha! It's okay, sweetie. I'm glad you're back. Where's the rest of our family? They'll be here soon.
