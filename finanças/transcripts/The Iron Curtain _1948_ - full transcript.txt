"Carrying three passengers from Soviet Russia." "They had left Moscow about one week before." "Had landed at Fairbanks, Alaska." "And were now on their way to Ottawa, the capital of Canada." "One of the passengers was Colonel Aleksandr Trigorin." "The new military attach? to the Soviet Embassy in Canada." "The other was Major Semyon Kulin." "His aide and secretary." "The third was Igor Gouzenko." "A specially trained cypher clerk and decoding expert." "It was Gouzenko's first time out of Soviet Russia." "As soon as they landed they were taken to the Soviet Embassy." "Interviewed by Ilya Ranov." "Second secretary of the embassy and Chief of the NKVD." "The Soviet Secret Police." I am now in a foreign country and must always be alert against enemies. I must be careful of all manner of acquaintanceship. I mustn't engage in cordial conversation with any foreigner whatsoever. Never borrow money from a foreigner. In my apartment, I must be respectful to neighbors but make no friends. I must never permit myself to be more drunk than either my guests or my host. A sober brain, a firm tongue and alertness. These things must always be with me when I'm with foreigners. Where were you born? - Kovachova. You were in the Red Army? Yes. - What branch? Military Intelligence. Cypher division. I had training in coding and decoding at the Secret Intelligence School, Moscow. I am also a member of the Young Communist League. What is your duty here? Cypher clerk. Military Attach?'s office. What do you know about this idiot? He was assigned to me by Headquarters Military Intelligence. Before you left Moscow, you were given answers to the questions I just asked. Why didn't you use them? Sorry, Comrade Ranov. I thought with you .. You will give those answers to everyone, no matter who. You will think, eat, sleep, breathe those answers until you know no others. Where were you were born? - In the town of Gorky, Steroniv Street. What school? - Economics Technical Institute. What is your duty? I am employed by the military attach? as translator and secretary. Have you ever been a soldier? - No. Never. That's better. I give only one warning. As a cypher clerk you are a fountain of information. No-one, not even members of the Embassy staff. Must know who you are and what you're work is. No-one will know. One more thing. You'll be wise never to forget that even on foreign soil you're a Soviet citizen. And soldier. I could never forget that Comrade Ranov. We will see. Bushkin will take you to the cypher section. That's all. Karanova, come in please. My secretary, Nina Karanova. Colonel Trigorin. Major Kulin. An unexpected pleasure. Will you have dinner with me tonight? Karanova. You will handle this matter yourself. Yes, Comrade Ranov. You haven't answered my question. A cold fish, isn't she. The bell is here. Comrade Lieutenant Vinikov. This is Lieutenant Igor Gouzenko. The new military attach? cypher clerk. He is yours from now on. I hope you like music. Ranov's cypher clerk uses that room. That one belongs to the diplomatic cypher clerk. This is the wash-room. The small incinerator is in the far room to your left. The large one to the right. This is yours. No-one is permitted in this section excepted authorised persons. You will give me all messages for transmission. When you've finished with the code books. Give them to the chief of the cypher section who will put them in his safe. He's the only one that knows the combination. When your day's work is done. Every scrap of paper must be burnt. Every drawer. And the door of the safe must be sealed with the Top Secret seal. And don't ask me why "the church" means Top Secret. I don't know. You will take no papers from this room without showing them to me first. And don't ask to have the music turned off. It is a rule. The music must always play. So no-one can hear what's being said in the other offices. I hate music. "Karanova, Ranov's secretary, was extremely friendly with Gouzenko." "She had introduced herself to him. Offered to help find him an apartment." "On his first night in Ottawa they met in front of the Ch?teau Laurier." "They went to a gay restaurant." "Gouzenko discovered that Canadians were a happy people." "Who even in wartime seemed to enjoy themselves." "They danced until closing time." "And then they went to her apartment." Why, this is your apartment? Uhuh. You live here all alone? Alone. This is good enough for a Commissar. I spend every penny I earn on this apartment. Do you think you could find me one like it? Well I'll try. I'll ask the manager in the morning. Pour yourself a drink. I'll be right back. Living must be cheap over here. It was cheaper in Tokyo. Did you live there? In the Soviet Embassy. Berlin, too. Were you a secretary in Berlin? And in Tokyo. I was trained for diplomatic service. Perhaps we went to the same school. I went to the Economic Technical Institute. Any others? Did you have a drink? I'll have another. And you? No more tonight. Well, you expect me. You must be very tired. It was a long journey. Here. Let me make you more comfortable. Look. I might fall asleep. When do you begin work? Tomorrow. Is your office in the embassy? Yes. Then we'll see lots of each other. Have another drink? You have plenty? - Oh. Here in Canada there is plenty of everything. It's always been very quiet. At the Military Attach?'s office. The arrival of men like you and .. Colonel Trigorin. Promise great changes. Does it? But of course. That's wonderful. It makes the stomach dance. I'm getting sleepy. Well then, rest. Tomorrow you will have to work very hard. There will be messages. Many secret messages. Is that true? I am a very important person. With all kinds of important secrets. I'll tell you one. My wife is very beautiful. More beautiful than I? Hers is a quiet kind of beauty. Soft and warm. And mine? Your beauty is a thing carved out of granite. No body or soul. You are being unfriendly now. Why? You're not very clever. You've been away from Russia too long. Experience has provided new techniques. You should learn them. For one thing, never ask direct questions. And for another. You should never bring a Russian to a place like this for questioning. It might dull the wits of the Canadians but to Russians it means only one thing. It would be better. Not to make an enemy of me, Comrade Gouzenko. I don't want to make an enemy of you any more than I want you make a fool of me. I drink vodka like a true Russian. I love my wife. And I thank you for everything. And of course you will tell the truth about me because if you don't .. I'll have to tell how easy it was to see through you. Goodnight. I was born in the town of Gorky. On Steroniv Street. I was never a soldier. "In days Gouzenko settled down to the job for which he had been trained." "The very first message he decoded ordered Trigorin and Ranov." "To meet someone codenamed .." "Paul." "Paul's registration card was in the secret file." "Surname: John Grubb." "Canadian citizen." "Codename: 'Paul'." "Detailed material on his biography is recorded in files in the Comintern." Get in, gentlemen. I've been expecting you, Trigorin. Welcome to Canada. It is time you know. It is time they sent someone competent. Canada is important. It will be more important when we've won this war. Do you understand that? Did they tell you that? My orders are to build a large organisation. A "large organisation". What's that? A mass of people swarming like bees? Or a few smart ones in the right places? Our requirements are quite extensive. For example. Moscow must know what chance there is to get a man on the General Staff level. They're mad. They'll be asking for the Prime Minister next. Not until his name is John Grubb. Canada is not yet ready for me. You're not dealing with an amateur, Colonel. I founded the party in Canada in 1920. I am a graduate of the Lenin school. For your information. I take my orders directly from Moscow. Not from the embassy. I sometimes need to remind Ranov of that. No. You need people in the right places. The Army, the Air Force, the Navy. The National Research Council. The Department of External Affairs. This is a general list of required information. Stop here. They are asking for a lot. They'll get it. Goodnight, gentlemen. House of Commons. Members Entrance. Good evening, John. "The Associated Friends of Soviet Russia." "One of many front organisations." "Provided a showcase for potential agents." "Here, John Grubb could spot those ready for what's named 'further development'." "Among them was one Captain Donald Class." "A member of the Royal Canadian Air Force." "Stationed in Ottawa." Now, I have no desire. Other than to see the war quickly concluded. With an allied victory. And. The sooner we open a second front .. The sooner we will have peace. Ladies and gentlemen. To our Soviet friends. "In addition to the front organisations, there were small, private gatherings." "Known as study groups." "Here, Communist philosophy and techniques were studied." "And the writings of Marx, Engels and Lenin were read and discussed." "John Grubb knew that Donald Class belonged to such a group." "He passed Class on to Leonard Leitz." "Now it was Leitz's job to see if Class he had been mentally developed .." "To the point where he could be of practical service the Soviet Union." I .. I hope you don't mind my taking you away from Karl Marx, Captain. I know him by heart. - Good. I'm glad to see you never miss a study group meeting. I can't think of anything more important. Still editing the Military Journal? - Yes, sir. Your work must bring you in contact with people engaged in secret war projects. Yes, sir. How many of them would you say are .. Sympathetic to us? I've met several. At various study groups. Anyone in the National Research Council? Yes. Warren Blair. He's in the radio lab. Will Hollis. He's in radar. Sit down, Captain. Captain Class. All kinds of people come to these Marxist study groups. They fall into two categories. First, there are the "talkers". They of course are the loudest, the most emotional. To some, Marxism is a kind of a game they play. To rid them of their frustrations. To others, it's a kind of a fashionable cult. We know them for what they are. Essentially unreliable. Basically, cowards. Then there are the "doers". They never have too much to say. One can feel in them the fanaticism of the true believer. They understand the deadly earnestness of the class struggle. And are ready to make every sacrifice for it. Unfortunately. There are not too many "doers". Captain. You can be of service to our party. Providing your .. Loyalty is great enough. Let the party try me. It will. "Within a few weeks, Captain Donald Class was an active Soviet agent." "Through him, Gouzenko's files were fattened with new registration cards." "Foster." "Ernst. Leader." "The professor. Prometheus." "Eli, Gray, Frieda, Gaia and others." "All Canadians. All party members." "Now they were able to get all kinds of top secret information." "Helen Tweedy." "Code name: Nelly." "Employed as a clerk in the Department of External Affairs." "Through her they were able to invade the most secret diplomatic files." "In that way, getting vital information other governments entrusted to Canada." "The web kept growing in size." "And efficiency." [ Door knocks ] Major Kulin? [ Door knocks ] Come in. Come in, Gouzenko. Have a drink. Sorry, I haven't time right now. I've got some news for you. News. News. The world is full of news these days. But this is something I think .. - Don't get excited about it. That's what's important. And don't believe everything you hear. - This just came from Moscow. Then you must believe it. Every word of it. If you don't, Ranov will get after you. I don't like Ranov. Watch out for him, my boy. These pencil-pushers always make trouble for us soldiers. He doesn't frighten me. Not when I'm drunk. Listen, Comrade Major. Our wives are arriving. The day after tomorrow. Oh no. What time? 11:30. If we're lucky, the train will be late. Very late. Comrade Major. My wife will be on that train. Your wife was never a Captain in the Red Army. I hope you had a pleasant journey. No more until we get to our flat. We have a flat? Three rooms. All our own. No. Yes. Three rooms. Dr Norman? - Yes. I'm Leonard Leitz, MP from Montreal. - How do you do. My friend Dr Vincent wrote me you were coming to work at the Research Council. I took it upon myself to welcome you to Canada. That's very kind of you. And then after San Francisco we passed through Chicago and New York. The buildings, Igor. I was made dizzy by the size of them. Upstairs. Yes. Welcome home, Anna. Igor. There is the bedroom. There. Oh, it's beautiful. I don't know what to say. Don't say anything now. We have lots of time. I can't wait. I've got to tell you something. I've been waiting weeks to tell you. Is something wrong? - Oh no. Very wonderful. I'm going to have a baby. Anna. "The months passed quickly for the Gouzenkos." "It was spring." "Whenever he had time away from the embassy they would go for long walks." "Exploring what to them was a strange .." "Sometimes disturbing .." "Sometimes puzzling, world." The fact is, these people are politically uneducated. They have no leadership to help them think. Either they don't think at all or they think as they please. It isn't any wonder they get confused. But you haven't yet told me one thing. Ask me anything. Do you want a boy or a girl? Here I'm being totally brilliant on what's wrong with democracy .. Somehow, I'm not very interested tonight. Answer my question. Naturally. Everybody wants a boy first. Boys have a better future. They grow up to be men. [ Door knocks ] Good evening. No, please don't get up. I just popped by to ask you to try a piece of this apple pie. Oh, I had such luck with it. It turned out simply delicious. That's very kind of you. Not at all. It was too much for Albert and me anyhow. I've seen you often enough before but we've never met. Oh, I'm sorry. Igor, this is Mrs Foster. Our neighbor. How do you do. Are you feeling alright? I'm very well, thank you. - Oh, good. Now, don't forget to call me if you need anything. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Anna. I can't help it if she wants to be friendly. I'm here all day alone. Anna, you've been told time and time again. We must not fraternise with Canadians. But this is so .. - We won't talk about it anymore. We'll do as we're told. You'll keep that woman out of this house from now on. I'm sorry, dear. But we must be very careful. You know that. I'm old at being careful. [ Telephone ] Igor Gouzenko here. Yes, immediately, Comrade Colonel. That was Trigorin. He wants me down at the embassy right away. Something urgent has come up, he said. Couldn't it wait until morning? Of course. But it's like the army. You hurry here so you can wait longer there. It's snowing out. Put a scarf around your neck. I'll get a taxi. If I can. It worries me. Leaving you here all alone. I'll be alright. Are you sure of that? Of course. The doctor said it would be at least a week more. Doctors are sometimes wrong. Stop worrying, Igor. I feel very well. Get your work done and hurry home. I'll keep the bed warm for you. I'll hurry. Urgent. To the Director. The Professor reported that the director of the Chemical Research committee .. Stacy. Told him about the new plant under construction. The plant will produce uranium. As a result of experiments being carried out .. It has been found that uranium may be used filling bombs. The Americans have developed wide research work. Having invested in this business 660 million dollars. Grant. This goes to Moscow right away. It's urgent. Everything is always urgent. Especially getting back to bed. Someday I'll put a telephone book under my shirt. He'll never notice it. Try it and see. Wait a minute. There is a message for you. It came about an hour ago but I had orders not to disturb you. Your wife is at St Vincent Hospital. She has given birth to a 7 pound, 6 ounce boy. Both are doing well. A boy! "Colonel Trigorin's uranium message got an immediate reaction from Moscow." "This project was given precedence over every other activity." Do you know a scientist codenamed "Alec"? Alec? Yes. We met him when he arrived from England some months ago. He's considered a brilliant scientist. - Good. This just arrived from Moscow. Read it. "Alec is a very valuable source." "And therefore conduct this operation with as great a caution as possible." "He is a co-operant." "I consider it best to establish contact through Paul." "Director." He may be politically confused. He may need re-educating. We can't afford to waste time. The Director has given the uranium project top priority. I'll take care of it myself. What is his code greeting? "Best regards from Michael." Yes? Dr Harold Norman? Yes. Best regards from Michael. Come in please. Who are you? I am "Paul". And you are Alec. You have comfortable quarters here. You can't look at those papers. They are top secret. I wouldn't know what they meant if I looked at them all night. But you do. That's why I am here. - There is nothing I can tell you. You are working in the laboratory of the National Research Council? Yes. You are part of the atomic energy project? What of it? You have a nice phonograph. And Shostakovich. [ Music playing loud: Shostakovich ] Sit down, doctor. Sit down. Let's be comfortable while we listen. Beautiful, beautiful. The first flowering of a true proletarian culture. Or have you gone over to the capitalist enemy? We are allies now. Russia. England. The United States. It's a people's war against the fascists. Don't be blinded by this alliance. The interests of capitalism and communism can never be the same. As a friend of the worker. As a scientist who has dedicated his life to mankind. You would know that. You didn't come here to tell me that. What do you want? Detailed notes on everything having to do with the atomic project. Samples of uranium. Impossible. We are too closely watched. This is the most secret project in history. As a member of the party you willingly assumed certain responsibilities. In the past you never gave us reason to question your loyalty. But you don't understand. This is no ordinary explosive. This is a force as powerful as nature. Uncontrolled. It could destroy the world. - Exactly. That's why we must all have it. Don't you see? Then they will not dare use it. Think of it, Dr Norman. You and others like you. Can help bring peace to the world. Peace. And a chance for decent people to build a new free world. You can't refuse, Dr Norman. It will be your contribution to the safety of mankind. The safety of mankind? "Neutron." "Plutonium." "Chain reaction." "Fission." "These were new words to Gouzenko." "Words of a new atomic age being born in the laboratories of Canada and the USA." "Dr Norman worked at all of them." "Oak Ridge in Tennessee. Hanford in Washington." "Chalk River and Petawawa in Canada." "The new words were in his report to the Soviet Military Attach?." "Shortly after Germany collapsed Dr Norman provided Colonel Trigorin .." "With ten pages of information on the production process of the atomic bomb." "As a sample." "He also handed over a specimen tube with 162 micrograms of uranium 233." "This atomic information, still classified as Top Secret .." "Was considered so important that it was carried by hand to Moscow." Jump in, doctor. I told you I'd call you, when I had some. I have something for you. What? You are being sent back to England. How do you know? We know. Do you deny it? - No. I .. I just heard it myself. I was going to tell you. In a few days you will receive instructions .. About contacting one of our men in London. You will give him any additional information you have. And all the new information you will get. I've done about all I can. This whole business is extremely painful to me. You are becoming a sentimentalist, Dr Norman. You will receive further instructions within the next few days. "Finally it was over." "The tired world sang and danced and laughed." "Perhaps at last there would be peace in our time." There must be no misconceptions .. About our relations with our former capitalist allies. Our interests. Can never coincide. Our roles and aims .. Are quite different. We have no place for bourgeois sentimentalism. Only. Relentless .. realism. The class struggle will continue. Until this decadent .. Plutocratic democracy .. Is as completely destroyed .. As National Socialism. Therefore, you .. The representatives of the Soviet Union in Canada. Will, as always, remain .. Vigilant. Suspicious. And aloof. That will be all. Hello. Did you have a nice time? Yes, thank you. Was Andre alright? Not a peep out of him. That's a wonderful boy you have there, Mr Gouzenko. A real little gentleman. Thank you. Is there something wrong, Mr Gouzenko? Oh no. That is .. My husband isn't feeling very well. Oh. Well if it's his stomach I've got .. No thank you. He'll be alright if I get him to bed right away. In that case I'll run along this minute. You were very kind to put up with Andre. Oh, not at all. I might just as well sit here as in my own apartment. You sure that I can't do anything? If it's a headache .. Thank you. Nothing. Goodnight. Oh, very well. I hope you feel better. Goodnight. Anna. What could I do? You telephone me at the last moment .. Tell me I must come to the embassy immediately for a special meeting. I can't leave Andre alone. Somebody must look after him. Be grateful you have kind neighbors. Anna. You must understand, I'm not the one .. - You know nothing. He sleeps so peacefully. I'm sorry if I shouted at you but .. Poor little fellow. It would be a pity to have him grow up thinking the world is his enemy. By then everything will be better. Are you sure, Igor? Are you sure? Anna. I listened to Ranov the other night. And suddenly. Suddenly I was sick inside. These people are not our enemies. They are our friends. It is we who are acting like enemies. Anna. You must not say these things to me. I can't help it. I'm afraid. For him. For you. For me. Before I came here, I .. I believed everything. Now, I .. I can't even understand. We are simple people, Anna. We can't understand everything. We must have faith in our leaders. We must understand, Igor. We must. If I've learned anything here, Igor. I've learned that no human being should ever be forced to live in fear. Igor. - No more, Anna. You must not talk like that anymore. I won't listen to you. [ Radio: ] "A wave of jubilation and thanksgiving sweeps the cities of the land .." "At the news of Japan's surrender." "San Francisco has gone absolutely wild." "Market Street is jam packed with countless thousands of men and women .." "Celebrating the end of the war." "Thousands of servicemen waiting to be shipped to the Pacific." "Many of them veterans of the war in Europe." "Know their shooting days are done." "And are they tearing the town apart." "And who can blame them because .." "Peace." "Isn't it wonderful?" "To Grant." "Take measures to organise acquisition of extra documents on the atomic bomb." "Present information incomplete." "We must have in detail the technical process." "And drawings and calculations. Director." There is no questioning the urgency of the order. We are doing what we can. - It is not enough. You will contact every agent and alert them for atomic information. That is all. Gouzenko will remain. Oh, Gouzenko. A telegraph to The Director. We .. We have alerted every agent to .. That fantastic mushroom over Hiroshima. I saw the newsreel pictures. I can't get them out of my mind. A beautiful poisonous mushroom. What a weapon. I wish I knew more about it. One little bomb that makes a desert on which nothing can live. What more need you know? Sometimes, I think you're a great fool, Kulin. Gouzenko. Do you think I'm a great fool? Don't look at him, look at me. Consider me carefully. I've blood on both hands and I sleep with dead faces on my eyeballs. You have my permission to shut up, Kulin. Gouzenko, I told you. Look at me. See if you can look into my mind. We are defending Kharkov. It's snowing. There is blood to wade through. I ask for volunteers for a dangerous patrol. No-one volunteers. I shoot ten good Russians between the eyes. Shoot them dead. The eleventh volunteers. I have no more trouble and I have all the volunteers I could use. Kulin! As a man, I am called a "sadist". But what of governments that pile up dead and justify murder as a means to an end? What name do you call them? You. You simple Russian soul. You'll answer me. You are making it very difficult for him my friend. Don't force me to send you back to Russia. You. Gouzenko. Did you hear that? The threat of threats. To be sent back to Russia. Why should it have such an ominous sound? Like the ring of mourning bells or the executioner's volley. Why? Why? Have you figured it out? Why? Why? Go to your quarters. Consider yourself under arrest. Yes. It's about time. I can't stomach it anymore. An efficient firing squad will solve all my problems. It takes too long to drink oneself to death. Too long. Gouzenko. You have a good record, Gouzenko. It will stay that way unless you repeat a single word of what happened here. File this. I've got to talk to you, Comrade Major. Go away. Why do you say you can't stomach it anymore? What is it makes you willing to .. To face a firing squad? I'm drunk. I never know what I say when I'm drunk. Tell me, Kulin. You are the son of one of the great heroes of the revolution. Your father was close to Lenin. You're turning away from everything he stands for. Why? My father was once a great revolutionary Marxist. Today, he pays for a living by saying what he's told to say. Kulin. You know more than I. Do you think there is going to be another war? War is part of a process leading towards a general upheaval throughout the world. That will result in the establishment of world communism. There mustn't be another war. Never again. Listen, Kulin. There must be another way. Tell me the truth. Truth? What's that? I used to know when I was a very little boy. You don't know. You will never know. You were born too late. It is enough to make even a sadist cry. But listen to me. I've got a son. And I want to do what's right. - Go away, you simple Russian. They'll send you back too, if they catch you talking to me. Go away. "The truth .. you don't know." "You were born too late." "I've learned that no human being should ever be forced to live in fear." "Our roles and aims are quite different." "The class struggle will continue." "These people are not our enemies." "Don't force me to send you back to Russia." "Today, he pays for a living by saying what he's told to say." "What of governments that pile up dead and justify murder as a means to an end?" [ Anna: ] "Please understand me .. for his sake." "For his sake. For his sake." "For his sake." Igor? What's wrong? Everything. I was just talking to Kulin. They're sending him home, Anna. That was bound to happen. He drinks too much. He drinks to forget. Forget what? Himself. His father. Once, Kulin had great respect for his father. Now he has only contempt. He's sick. Sick with disappointment. That's a terrible thing for a father to do to a son. I mustn't do that to Andre. I must think now for him too. I must tell him what kind of a world I want him to live in. What kind of man I want him to be. Someday I'll have to answer to him. And I want to be able to face him without being afraid or ashamed. Maybe I'm wrong. But from what I've seen and learned. I've decided there is only one thing for us to do. Anna. We will not go back to Russia. "In the weeks that followed, Gouzenko formulated a plan." "He selected certain key documents from his secret file." "He very carefully marked each one." The Colonel wants to see you in his office immediately. Thanks. What are you doing? Just straightening out my files. Pretty busy, eh? Very busy. - No rest for the wicked, huh? Igor. My old friend, I'm glad to see you. Sergeyev. When did you arrive? - Today. Sergeyev is your replacement. You are returning to Russia. Immediately? As soon as you have shown Lieutenant Sergeyev everything he should know. You will work together from now on. Yes, Comrade Colonel. - That's all. Comrade Gouzenko. I hear you are going home. Yes. Are you happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? You might at least introduce me, Igor. He's not very polite, is he. Comrade Sergeyev - Comrade Karanova. We will see more of each other I hope. You will. "Gouzenko realised that from now on his replacement, Sergeyev .." "Would be continually at his side." "To complete his plan, he needed to take immediate action." "That same night he returned to the embassy." What are you doing? - Cleaning out my files. Good. I hope Sergeyev is as efficient as you. Gouzenko, send this off tonight. To Moscow. Right away. Right away. Right away? What is it, a declaration of war? You get grumpier every day. I need excitement. Then why don't you lock up the place and come and see a move with me? Nobody would know the difference. Except you. Go along now before I report you for trying to make me neglect my duties. Quitting already? - Yes. Come here. What do you want? If I was going home .. I'd take a pocket full of watches with me. I'd be a Colonel in no time, I'll bet you. Good idea. Goodnight. Gouzenko. Well, Gouzenko? All packed and ready to go? Yes, Comrade Ranov. Good. I'll see you before you leave. "Gouzenko went directly to The Justice Building." "Convinced the information he had must go to the highest level of government." "He was determined to see no-one less that the Minister of Justice." [ Door knocks ] Who is it? Igor. I went to The Justice Department. There was nobody there but a sentry. I couldn't tell him anything. How could I trust him? They'll be searching for you at 12 tomorrow. - I know. I'll go back to the Justice Department first thing in the morning. You and Andre will come with me. I won't leave you here alone. We'll come. What are those? Diaries. Cables to and from Moscow. Agents reports on the atomic bomb. High explosives, radar. False passports. Even notes on the secret meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill in Canada. A hundred documents. The whole story in the agent's own handwriting. What they've been doing in Canada. They will surely kill you when they find out. I tell you the minister will not see you unless you tell me what you have. But you must understand please. I cannot tell my business to anyone but the minister himself. Why not? It's a matter of great secrecy. It involves the Canadian and Russian governments. The minister is in his other office. At the Parliament buildings. Perhaps if you go there ..? Thank you. We will go there. Trigorin here. Have you telephoned his apartment? Strange. Call me when he gets in. Hello Ranov? Gouzenko is late for work. Anna, it is after two. Please, we've been waiting for two hours. Time is important. I am terribly sorry but the minister is running behind with his appointments. If you can come by tomorrow we may be able to fit you in somewhere. No answer. I'm afraid there are documents missing from the files. What kind? We are checking now. "Gouzenko was beaten." "His story was too big, too incredible." "If the Canadian government would not listen." "Then he had risked everything for nothing." "Then suddenly he remembered what he had learned about the Canadian newspapers." "Their independence, their freedom." "They were his last hope." Andre. Now be a good boy. Excuse me please. Can you tell me where to find the editor? He's out. It's very important. Try the city desk. In the corner. I have some very important information for you. Sit down. - No thank you. I am from the Russian Embassy. I have some papers here that can prove it. Just go ahead. I can listen to you at the same time. The papers that will prove that Soviet Russia .. Is operating a spy system in Canada. Go ahead. This document will prove that one scientist working on the atomic bomb. Is giving information to the Soviet Military Attach?. There is no time to lose. Already they are looking for me. You must print these right away. Before they kill me. Sure. Before they kill you. Your life is in danger, isn't it? Well, you take the stuff to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. They'll take care of you, and those Russians too. But the Canadian people should know as soon as possible what they're .. Of course they should. But there is nothing I can do with this. You must do something. It's for the safety of your country. Have you been to the Justice Department? Yes. They won't see me. - Sorry. If the government won't touch it, I guess it's too big for us too. Excuse me. Who is the unhappy man? - Some crackpot. What happened? They acted as if I were crazy. They must believe me. They must. What are we going to do then? Go home and pack. You. You worked with him every day. Day and night. Couldn't you feel something was happening to him? Was there no hint of anything? The Secret Police takes care of feelings and hints. He may have gone directly to the police. If so, we demand he be turned over to the embassy immediately as a deserter. We will say he stole embassy funds. And we'll be in the newspapers. We'll be investigated. We'll be arrested. Friends we have developed. Will be frightened away. Organisations that we have built. Will collapse. And the work of many years. My work. Will be completely wasted. We have checked every hotel. We are watching the rail-road station, bus stations, the airport. The main highways. There's no way Gouzenko and his family can leave Ottawa without being seen. What about his apartment? - He wouldn't dare go back there. Where else could he go? He can't walk the streets of Ottawa all day and night with a wife and an infant. He would eventually go home. Realising you are too stupid to believe he would dare go there. We will go to his apartment. They will come here. Any minute now. You must take Andre some place where he will be safe. A hotel in some other city. - You will come also? I must be here when they come. But they'll kill you. - Anna. It's you and Andre I'm doing this for. Please don't make it worthless. You will pack now, Anna. Take this. I'll get you more. Go to the Royal Hotel. Wait for me there. If I'm not there within .. [ Door knocks ] Gouzenko. Gouzenko. [ Baby crying ] [ Door knocks ] [ Door knocks ] Vinikov. Has he gone? - No. Anna, we won't be able to leave now. Come with me. Hurry. You and Andre will go to Mrs Foster's next door and wait there. If anything should happen to me, turn these over to the police. Tell them the whole story. I won't go without you. - Anna, please. There is no time. Come on. Please hurry. This is no time to talk. Come on. Hurry. Hello there. Go in. Go in. [ Door knocks ] [ Door knocks ] Gouzenko. [ Door knocks ] Gouzenko. We know you are there. Let us in. Good evening, Comrade Gouzenko. Sit down. We were worried about you, Gouzenko. Thought perhaps you were ill. You are ill, aren't you. You must be. You've been working too hard. Had a nervous breakdown. Your mind is temporarily affected, isn't it. Have you lost your tongue too? We will help you to find it if we must. Your mind snapped. That's what happened. You didn't want to leave this lovely apartment. This plenitude of food. This easy living. You couldn't face going back to Russia. So your mind snapped, didn't it. Don't be stubborn, Gouzenko. You need only return those unimportant papers you took while you were so upset. It will be all forgotten. I haven't got the papers. Where are they? - Comrade Colonel. We must be patient with a person who is sick. You see, Gouzenko? We don't want to harm you. You understand? Now, where are the documents? Are they here? Search. Stand up! Trigorin, must I remind you that you?re are speaking to a sick man? Help Bushkin, please. Where is your wife and son? You don't really expect me to answer that question, do you? I was just curious. There is no use searching here. It is obvious that his wife has the papers wherever she is. That should not be too difficult to find out. Trigorin is not as patient as I am. Or as understanding. Perhaps it will be better if we all go to the embassy. I'm not going to the embassy, Ranov. I'm not going anywhere outside this house. Alive. You are sick. Aren't you. Sick, maybe. Sick like Major Kulin was sick. You have a father, Gouzenko. You have a mother, a brother and a sister. Your wife has a mother, a father and two sisters. All live in Russia. - They've nothing to do with it. Exactly. They have nothing to do with this. And yet .. You didn't think of them, did you. You didn't think of what might happen to them. We heard them break in! We called the police. What's going on in here? Who are you? We are from the Soviet Embassy. Gouzenko is one of our employees. He was ordered to return to Russia but he decided to disobey orders and desert. Naturally, we couldn't permit that. We came here to .. To reason with him. They came her to kill him. What have you got to say about this? What's happened to you? Why don't you speak? Anna. Go and get the documents. This is a most embarrassing situation, officer. As I say, this man is a Russian national who refused to return to his homeland. Actually I think he is ill. In any event this is strictly an embassy problem of no concern to .. Anna. Give them to the officer. Those documents are Soviet property! They were stolen from the Soviet Embassy. I must warn you. Unless you return the papers immediately I shall report you to your government. This is kinda getting over my head. I don't know .. Officer. Those are not only papers. They are a death warrant. When I gave them to you I sentenced myself .. And my family and my wife's family to execution. We must all die sooner or later so it doesn't really matter. It's how we die and why we die that is important. Take them away with you. And take my wife and child. This man is insane. As a representative of the Soviet Government. I demand that you hand me those documents. You say they were stolen? - Yes. Stolen property must be identified and claimed at Police Headquarters. That's the law. You will hear from my government. We will go now. You must not let them go. They'll come back! They will never rest .. - Anna. Anna. Please be quiet. We have nothing more to say. We'll give you protective custody until the government looks into these things. Come along. Oh, Igor. They are going to listen to you. They are going to listen to you. If you run out you admit guilt. That puts the whole party on the spot. You've got to fight this thing on the floor of the Commons. Use every parliamentary trick you know. You've got to stir up the front organisations. And sympathetic newspapers and periodicals. Stop them howling about forgeries. About witch-hunts. About violations of democratic rights. That's fine. But what if they send me to prison? You will be a martyr. And, by the time you get out. You will be a hero. And will you be a hero along with me? The party comes first. What about Igor Gouzenko? If he goes unpunished. Others might do the same. Don't be too unhappy, Leitz. We'll name a city after you. When we take over. "Moscow. Urgent." "The following members of the staff of the Soviet Embassy in Ottawa Canada." "Will return without delay to Moscow." "Comrade Nina Karanova." "Comrade Lieutenant Josef Sergeyev." "Comrade Colonel Aleksandr Trigorin." "Comrade Ilya .." "Ranov."
