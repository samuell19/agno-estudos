[music playing] I'm ready. We're going to record this conversation. I hope you don't mind. No. No, not at all. It's been done many times before. Would you be kind enough start with your name and age, please? Will Donovan, 32 years old. Wait a minute. Willie Donovan. Aren't you-- Little Willie Donovan. Child star. That's me! Hollywood's youngest millionaire. Has been at seven years old. Haven't worked in 25 years. Why don't you just tell us what happened, Will? Where do I begin? Generally, at the beginning. Wherever you want. It's your story. You just pick a point and go. Well, I guess it all started when I was spending all my time at home. So I'd spend all my days getting lost on my computer. And that's how I met Delilah. Now, Delilah was your lover? My mother? Your lover. No. Well, yes. Oh, no. Not really. It's OK, Will. You just relax. Now, you met this Delilah on a computer? Yeah. We chatted for a while, and-- WILL DONOVAN (VOICEOVER): I've always wanted to be in a room full of candles, the two of us, naked. I would gently touch every part of your body. Delilah, I-- DELILAH (VOICEOVER): I want lots of soft kisses-- WILL DONOVAN (VOICEOVER): Lots of soft kisses. DELILAH (VOICEOVER): Explore every inch. WILL DONOVAN (VOICEOVER): Up and down your body. DELILAH (VOICEOVER): Touch me. WILL DONOVAN (VOICEOVER): I won't miss any part of you. DELILAH (VOICEOVER): Have me. WILL DONOVAN (VOICEOVER): Starting with your neck, down your chest, and across your tummy. DELILAH (VOICEOVER): Supple. Kiss. Neck. Up. Down. In. I want lots of soft kisses. Explore every inch. Taste me. Touch me. Touch me. Have me. I didn't know what she looked like, and I didn't know what she sounded like, but-- but she seemed to know me. I mean, she knew what to say. She just knew how to get to me. And-- just like my mother. Your mother? Did she call you? No, there haven't been any calls for you from anybody. She'll call. Yeah, she'll call. You see, my old man split when I was just a kid. My mother was my whole life. MAN (VOICEOVER): I don't even know if the kid's mine. I'm gone! WILL DONOVAN: I remember I would hide from her on the beach, trying to get her attention, but she never really seemed very concerned about. MOM (VOICEOVER): Willie, not now. Look, I've spilled my damn drink. Go make me another one. WILL DONOVAN: Sometimes I think I see her on the beach, but I-- MAN: You all right, Willie? You can let your feelings out. You're among friends here. MOM (VOICEOVER): The little Willie show. Little Willie's world. Little Willie's life. I had a life before I had you. I didn't even want you. WILL DONOVAN: So I live in a world of erotic fantasies. It's all I seem to have. DELILAH (VOICEOVER): Now, let me tell you my fantasy. [music playing] I want you to break into my house, like a burglar, and find me in my room. I'll pretend I'm asleep. Discover me in my bed. Come into my bed. I want you to envelope me. I want to feel your touch everywhere. Lose yourself in me. I want to feel you surging, bursting open the doors of my passion. I need to feel you resounding in every tissue. Every feeling, every nerve. [whispering] And when I'm there, I want you to shoot me. WILL DONOVAN (VOICEOVER): Shoot you? DELILAH (VOICEOVER): It's only a fantasy, Will. They'll be blanks in the gun. Pull the trigger. Pull the trigger. WILL DONOVAN (VOICEOVER): I can't. DELILAH (VOICEOVER): I didn't think so. I didn't think you were man enough to do it. [waves crashing] It's kind of late. I thought you were asleep. How long you exercise for? I'm sorry, baby. We got to talking. You know Susan. I thought you'd call. I never did before. I knew something was wrong. Nothing's wrong. Come on. Tell me. I guess I'm just a little frustrated. Well, why don't you go out instead of sitting around here all day? I'll be fine if I got a job. What does your agent say? Nothing. You know he's forgotten me. Well, I wouldn't worry if I were you. You're lucky you don't have to work. Believe me. I'd love to be able to sit around the house all day and do nothing. It's not all that great. I'm glad you're here. I wait for you all day. Will, I'm kind of tired. DELILAH (VOICEOVER): Hello, you're back. WILL DONOVAN (VOICEOVER): Is this Delilah? DELILAH (VOICEOVER): What do you think? WILL DONOVAN (VOICEOVER): I think she caught me. DELILAH (VOICEOVER): Did you want her to? WILL DONOVAN (VOICEOVER): I just can't seem to put things together. I mean, I feel like someone is in my head turning it all around. DELILAH (VOICEOVER): Does it make you mad, your wife's attitude, your loss of success, your feelings of inadequacy? WILL DONOVAN (VOICEOVER): I don't feel-- DELILAH (VOICEOVER): Sure you do. I know you, Will. You're like me. Alone, misunderstood, harassed. WILL DONOVAN (VOICEOVER): So what do I do? DELILAH (VOICEOVER): Take control. Fight back. Push your limits. Take a risk. WILL DONOVAN (VOICEOVER): What kind of risk? DELILAH (VOICEOVER): Fulfill my fantasy. Good morning. Hi. You feel better today? What do you mean? You seemed depressed yesterday. You know, all that talk about having nothing to do and no meaning to your life. It was just talk. I didn't mean anything by it. All right. Don't get defensive. Come on. Come down to the beach with me. So what are you going to do today? Go to Susan's. Going to play with the computer? I might a bit. Who do you talk to on that thing? Oh, different people. We swap programs and stuff. Really? It's kind of fun. It's getting kind of boring. Is it? What are you going to do when you get sick of that? Would you ever leave me? What a question. I'm serious. If you ever left me, I don't know what I'd do. I'd die. You're spending too much time in the house. Look, I'm going to go for a walk. You want to come? No, thanks. OK. [typing] WILL DONOVAN (VOICEOVER): I can't stop thinking about what you said. DELILAH (VOICEOVER): I know. WILL DONOVAN (VOICEOVER): What do you mean, you know? Who taught you about me? How can you know what excites me? DELILAH (VOICEOVER): Don't ask questions. I just know. I know what men like you need. You need someone to take control. You won't, and I know just how. WILL DONOVAN (VOICEOVER): Oh? DELILAH (VOICEOVER): Let me tell you about my tea party. [music playing] [clanking] [whispering] [clap] [laughing] [typing] Will? Sorry, I didn't hear you come in. You're really busy, aren't you? How was your walk? Good. Listen, I'm gonna go to Susan's. Tell her I said hello. Oh. Don't work too hard. Susan? Oh, hi, sweetheart. Susan, I have to talk to you. What's the matter? I'm so tired of it. I can't go on. Wait a minute. Come here. Will's driving me crazy. He's impossible. I try so hard, I really do. You know I do. I put up with him. You have no idea what it's like. I have work, and I hate it. And then I come home, and I have to take care of this child. What happened this time? It's everything. I'm with him on the beach, and he's going on about how empty his life is and how he would die if I left him. Then, I go up to the house and he's on that fucking computer of his. I read it, and he's on the line with some woman talking about licking up honey off her boot, which I guess isn't so bad. He's such a child. What about that guy you're seeing? But this guy means nothing to me. I'm going to burn in hell for it. I don't know. Will's been getting worse and worse. I can hardly reach him. I'm worried about him. You ought to be worried about yourself. MAN (VOICEOVER): Dear Willie, I sit alone in this damn hospital room. I need your little hand to hold my old, feeble hands. I have surrounded myself with pictures of you from all your movies, and when I feel my breath leaving me and I begin to choke, I look at your smile, and suddenly I can breathe again. Please respond. I have no one. I need your letters. Love, Herman. WILL DONOVAN (VOICEOVER): I'd like to reconsider. DELILAH (VOICEOVER): Will, I'm tired of talking. WILL DONOVAN (VOICEOVER): You're there? I'd like to do what you said it. DELILAH (VOICEOVER): You'll break into my house tonight. You'll come into my bedroom, force me to have sex, even if I struggle. WILL DONOVAN (VOICEOVER): Yes. DELILAH (VOICEOVER): And when we're there, you'll shoot me. WILL DONOVAN (VOICEOVER): I'll do it. DELILAH (VOICEOVER): I want you to do everything I say. WILL DONOVAN (VOICEOVER): I will. DELILAH (VOICEOVER): I live at 1370 Hillwood Drive. Shoot me. Shoot me. [pot shatters] Jesus. Hey! What the hell are you doing in my house? Hi, I'm robbing you. Listen to me, bumhole. You either get out of my house right now, or I'm going to put a bullet right through your chest. Now! What do you got, cotton in your ears? You asked me to come here. You're some kind of lunatic, aren't you? Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house like this? I'm a burglar. And you're a helpless victim, and now you're mine. What the fuck are you talking about? Get out! Now! I'm sorry. I guess I'm just-- I'm just no good at this stuff. Did you hear me? I said fucking get out! All right. Give me this then! Give it to me! All right. Is that what you wanted? [yelps] Give it to me! That's what I like to see. [struggling] [upbeat jazz] Give me-- give me that thing. Ow, ow, ow. Looks like I found you, huh? Come on, get up. Get up. Come here. Come here. Come here! [struggling] Oh, that's nice. Yeah? Turn over. Roll over. OK, OK. [groaning] [gunshot] [sighing] What'd you think? Hm? Huh? Baby? [heavy breathing] WILL DONOVAN (VOICEOVER): What I need, you need. What I need-- what I need. DELILAH (VOICEOVER): [inaudible] struggle. [moaning] I want you to do everything I say. Come to me. Pull the trigger. WILL DONOVAN (VOICEOVER): Oh, Jesus. DELILAH (VOICEOVER): I want you to shoot. I live at 1370 Hillwood Drive. WILL DONOVAN (VOICEOVER): I need control. I need control. [inaudible] [typing] Delilah, what a game tonight. You got me. I believed it. I feel like I'm walking on air. Reach me tomorrow? So you-- you just assumed this was all part of Delilah's plan? Yes. I felt such an incredible rush from it all. It was so different from the way I thought it would be. And when I saw that she had created this-- this scene for us to share, I-- well, for some strange, fantastic reason-- felt safe, like a kid again, you know what I mean? Make believe? You mean you didn't actually think you'd killed her, even after you saw the blood. That is a little hard for us to accept. You either killed her, or you didn't. I felt that she controlled it. I believed in her. That was part of the fantasy. She allowed me to-- to think that I'd gotten away with something terrible. I mean, that was a thrill in it for me, not the murder. Didn't you ever stop to consider, Will, that this is a very dangerous game? Well, whether it was a game or not, it did something to me. You know what I mean? We know very well what you mean. I couldn't even sleep at night without having some intense sexual fantasy. [echoed moaning] Will? Will? Oh, Hi. Will, what's this? What do you mean? What is it? It looks like blood. It's not blood. It's-- it's punch. Oh, it's not punch. I'm not stupid, Will. And why would you wash it? I mean, you never wash anything. That's right, I washed it. The machine doesn't work, remember? The guy's coming out to fix it. I want to know what you did last night. What do you mean, what did I do? I-- I was-- Will, last night you were almost in tears talking about being violent. I wake up later and you're nowhere in the house. And then I find the shirt that you wore covered in blood! All right. You know what? I am sick of this. Sick of what? Sick of being your fucking babysitter. My babysitter? What does that mean? I can't be stuck like this. You're a child, and I have no time for it. I've tried too hard. Just because of a fucking t-shirt? Oh, Christ! It's not the t-shirt! You're sick, Will! I mean, look at yourself. You're a hermit. You're like Howard Hughes locked up in this box you call a home, playing with toys. You never complained before. Yeah, because I thought you'd change. But no, you just want to hang on to your dead fame. I mean, all you do is brood. You know how depressing it is to come back here night after night when everybody else I know is living their lives? You're nothing. You have nothing. I'm sorry you have to hear this, but there, I said it. You don't exist. [door shuts] [typing] [whispering] [music playing] [knocking] Yeah? Hi, how are you doing? I'm Jack Garner. May I help you? Yeah, I think you can. Really? Absolutely. What can I do for you? Well, maybe I ought to come inside. I'd rather stay out here, if you don't mind. I don't mind. Listen, you know, what we have to talk about-- it's kind of delicate. It's about a woman-- dead woman. [chuckles] I can't imagine how that would have anything to do with me. Oh, I think you can imagine. Can you imagine 2:00 AM this morning out on Hillwood? Can you imagine that? It wasn't real. It wasn't real? Shit, it looked real. And I just left her 30 minutes ago, you know, lying all-- all still and all. I saw her. You saw her? Yeah. Yeah, I saw her. I didn't have anything to do with that. Sure look like you did. I mean, you were, like, standing over her with a gun. That was an accident. It was only a game. It's quite a game. There were blanks in the gun. Yeah? This gun? [mimics gunshot] Looks real, doesn't it? Huh? That's nutty. I mean, let's take a look at this, Will. You killed this woman. You say it was an accident. But are you going to fry for that? Huh? Think about the press. They'd have a heyday with this. I have no choice. But you do. How? I'm the only one who saw. I went back to check it out. I could help you, be your partner, fix the situation. How could you fix it? Keep my mouth shut, could even tidy up that little mess for you. Well, someone will look for her. Listen to me, this woman lives up to block from me. I mean, she's a frickin' recluse. Nobody-- I mean, nobody goes to see this girl. She'll just disappear. Is this a setup? Willie, boy, I wish it was. You killed that woman. I saw. How much do you want? $500,000, cash. Noon tomorrow. Right here. No. Now, get out of my house. This is bullshit! What do you think, I'm crazy? This is a setup. She's not dead. This is a setup. You rigged the whole damn thing! Well, I guess I will have to go to the police. Yeah, yeah, just get out of my house before I call the police! You know, I thought I made a pretty good offer. I mean, Will-- Will, you should see that poor girl lying in her own blood. Disgusting. Yeah, I'm sure it's pretty awful. Making a big mistake, Will. I mean, jail-- pretty heavy thing for a guy like you. Personally, I don't think you can cut it. I'm not going to jail. I didn't kill anyone. [sighs] What do you say we take a look? What? Before you jump to conclusions about me, God forbid. Let's take a little ride. [music playing] She's dead, all right. Wait, where you going? Where you going? Take a look. It's not-- It's not what? Huh? You did that. You. Nobody else. Go ahead, check it out. That's good. Yeah, touch her. That's it? Will, you're fickle. Now, one more time. Jail or money? [music playing] How do I know I can trust you? Well, that's a good question, Will. Let's think about it. I'm in it now. You go to jail, I go to jail. You keep your mouth shut, I keep my mouth shut. See the beauty of it? Like I told you, she'll just disappear. 500,000? What the fuck could you have possibly done that you need 500 grand? It's none of your business. Yes, it is my business. I've had it! It's my money. You're my lawyer, and you work for me! I can't be responsible for half of your liquid assets. Listen, John, give me my money. Now! Shit. What are you doing? I'm leaving. Wait! Wait! Let go of me! Wait! Stop it. Let go of me. Why are you leaving? Look, I've had enough, OK? I thought a lot about this, and I've talked to Susan. I've lost you, Will. You're gone. I tried. I really did. No, you can't go. You can't do this to me. I'm sorry. It just got to be too much. I can't take it anymore. You can't leave me alone. Oh, God, Will. You need help. Please-- please, pull your life together. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. [music playing] WOMAN (VOICEOVER): What is it? It looks like blood? Bullet right through your chest. WOMAN (VOICEOVER): You're a child! I have no time for it. MAN (VOICEOVER): I never wanted the goddamn kid. I don't even know if the kid's mine. WOMAN (VOICEOVER): You don't know how much I loathe being a part of your sick little world, but I have to because I'm your mother. Looks like I found you. Jesus Christ. That's right, Will. You? Me. What happened? Game's not over. [groans] I'm sorry. That doesn't do much for me, does it? You know something, Will? You're a slobbering pig. [whispering] LAURA (VOICEOVER): I am sick of this, sick of being your fucking babysitter. Who the fuck are you anyway? A seven-year-old movie star. You're sick, Will! You're like Howard Hughes locked up in this box you call a home, playing with toys. [gasps] I wouldn't hurt you. It's OK. It's OK. Laura? [music playing] Hi. That it? Yeah. Well? We done? I think we are. You're a bastard. You know what, Will? I never watched your movies. [knocking] Who is it? MAN (BEHIND DOOR): My name is John Beckman. I'm here to discuss the business transaction you made with my client, Willie Donovan. I don't know what you're talking about. MAN (BEHIND DOOR): Oh, come on. The briefcase belongs to me. I'm sure you're willing to discuss the matter. [coughing] How are you doing? Do you mind if I come in? Shit, you're already in. [door closes] Why don't take a seat? Thank you, I'd rather stand. [clears throat] I am curious about this little business proposition that you've offered Will. Well, I think that's a matter between your client and myself. I don't see where that involves you. Well, it does actually. I manage all his business affairs. But it's his money, right? It's not yours? Yes, but I do advise him. I mean, Will is a little naive when it comes to investments. Tell me something, do you play the markets? You play the piano? Because if you do, I feel you should reveal your sources to me. I'm considered quite an expert in my field. Is that right? My concern-- cash in a briefcase is a little odd, don't you think? I just want to make sure that this whole affair is, shall we say, on the level. You're accusing me of being off the level? Of course not. I mean, I don't know you. But it is a little odd, isn't it? I mean, people don't go around passing $500,000 in cash without signing papers or whatnot. But for all I know, you could be backing the horses. The system is designed in order to protect us all from mishaps. Well, you-- you-- you-- you-- you could run off with this money and not-- not produce anything! Papers have been signed. Well, that's terrific. Can I see them? They're in my office. Well, we could go to your office, I mean, if it's not an inconvenience. I really need-- just need to go over them. Well, you know, come to think of it, I'm kind of busy. Yes. Well, I see. Can I use your telephone? Absolutely. Terrific. And-- and about the papers, perhaps we can meet at your office tomorrow to go over them. I think we can work something out. Yes, I have a-- Detective Brannaman, please. Yes. [yells] [groans] [thwaps] Backing the horses. [chuckling] [music playing] WOMAN (VOICEOVER): Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Tommy, Monday would be wonderful. Of course I remember you. Oh, Tuesday-- Steven, I'm still tired from your last [inaudible]. Wednesday's yours, John. And if you're lucky, that won't be all. Not without me you don't. I'm on the phone. Thursday then. [inaudible] Not now, I'm on the phone. [inaudible] That bitch couldn't handle a real man. Willie, not now. How many times do I have to tell you? Sounds good. I can almost taste it. [inaudible] wait until [inaudible].. I've spilled my drink. Go make me another one. Gee, you want more? But I'm supposed to rest on Sunday. Willie, go work on your lines. Well, then [inaudible] what if I don't want to wear it? Go away, will you? Who said anything about wearing something else? Laura? Oh, I'm sorry. That's you, [inaudible]. Is it Monday? Yes, it is. Do you want me to skip today? No, no, it's fine. Just do what you got to do. Are you sick? You should have some soup. I'm going to make some for you. No, I'm fine, thanks. You know what is good for flu? Take a shot of olive oil, and then eat raw garlic, and you'll be fine soon after. Oh, and then-- then rub crushed tomatoes all over your chest, and sit in the bathroom with hot water running. And then the bathroom is hot and you sweat it all out. How about if I just sleep? OK. OK, but if you sleep a lot, you breathe in too much of your own breath, and then-- oh well, then you get poisoned. What a mess! What a mess. I'm sorry, just this last week has been out of control. Well, OK, but I don't get paid for out of control. I'll pay you whatever you want. I have to clean in here. Yeah, fine. Fine. [whispering] [tv theme playing] ANNOUNCER: [inaudible] starring [inaudible],, and Will Powers as Little Willie! [laughing] WILL DONOVAN (VOICEOVER): [inaudible] WOMAN: Take control. Fight back. [inaudible] Push your limits. WOMAN (VOICEOVER): (ECHOING) Willie. Willie. Come to me. [inaudible] Hillwood Drive. Come to me. Don't change that channel. I'm coming to you live. [inaudible] do you want to wear nice clothes, nice jewelry? Do you want to have nice Rolex watches, drive fancy limousines, have a beautiful show? [inaudible] my friend, Rico. Say hi, Rico. Meet my wife. WOMAN: Hello. Do you want to make a living? Do you want to make money? Do you want to be a millionaire? Call this number. Give them the number. 555-JOEY-D. That's right. 555-JOEY-D. Stop working so hard. All you got to do is call this number. Say it again. 555-JOEY-D. How could you? She's not dead three days and you move into her house with a man who almost ruined my life? Will, what are you talking about? Oh, I think you know what I'm talking about. I saw you with him in her shower. Her shower! Will, I am going to call the police! Shut up, Susan! You betrayed me. Will, you're crazy. You're not making sense. She's dead, Laura. And I'm not the only one with blood on my hands. Yours are dripping, too. You took advantage of my situation, huh? That's great. Will, please. I don't know-- Hey! Hey! You're no worse than me. You can't condemn me. I hope you can live with this because what you're doing is unspeakable. Will. MAN (VOICEOVER): Willie, you've let me down. You've been a bad little boy. You're like all the rest. I don't care anymore. I give up on you. Now, I hate you. [struggling] [paper ripping] [clattering] [clattering] [inaudible whispering] [frantic voices] [knocking] MAN (BEHIND DOOR): Washer repair! Oh. Sorry. I'm here to fix the washer, right? We don't need it fixed. Really? How come? Works now. Maybe I should check it because I'm here and-- half the time I leave, the machine stops working and I got to come all the way back. It's kind of-- Yeah, all right, but it's fixed. That would be something, machine fixing itself. What if I fixed it? Oh, you fixed it. You're the mechanical type, huh? Yeah, that's right. You don't have to bother. All right, I'll leave. Do you-- do you smell gas? I-- here's your problem. You got all the burners on, and the pilots are out. All right, I'll put it right back together. It's kind of slippery down here. You know, this is really dangerous, especially when you got the cracks in the windows all taped up. I'll try to be more careful. Maybe I should check out the washing machine just the same. What do you think? Yeah, all right. Follow me. OK. You keep the machines out of the house? That's smart. It's a nice little walk and they don't clutter up the place. [banging] What does a guy like you got the whole world and a view of the ocean-- what does a guy like you got the gas on? I can't see any other way. Go take a swim, man. That's what I do when I'm feeling shitty. Get back in the ocean because in a week, you know, it's-- it'll all be different. Yeah. Yeah, I'll go for a swim. That's a good idea. [waves crashing] [inaudible whispering] WOMAN (VOICEOVER): You make me want to vomit. MAN (VOICEOVER): You killed that woman. I saw. WILL DONOVAN (VOICEOVER): Yeah, I saw you with him in her shower. Her shower! MAN (VOICEOVER): Say it again. 555-JOEY-D. WILL DONOVAN (VOICEOVER): Delilah. 555-- WILL DONOVAN (VOICEOVER): Delilah! 555-- [interposing whispering] You must like the water. Why do you say that? Well, it's not the first time that you've gone for a swim. I mean, according to the file here, you attempted suicide in the ocean, what, seven years ago? And five years before that. I guess I have a thing for the water. My mother used to take me to the beach all the time. She loved it. Has she called yet? You have had no calls. Will, stay with me a second here. Now, you went swimming. You dove under the water, and then suddenly remembered a commercial that showed a young woman that you thought was the Delilah that you killed. Is that what you're saying? No. No, I didn't think it was Delilah. I knew it was her. And I had to find her. What was so important about finding her? Because she was the key to what was happening to me. [music playing] Yeah, I saw your commercial last night, and I need to know the name of the woman who played Joey D's wife. Yeah. Look, I'm a producer, all right? What was her name? Thanks. I need the number for Dana Mills. And her address! And her address! [door closes] [knocking] Can I help you? All right. Come on. Come on. Hey! Come on, let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on! What the hell? What are you doing? Ow, ow, ow. Get in the car. No! Ow, ow, ow. Ow. Listen to me, mister. I don't know who you are, but you are dead! You know who I am. I'm the one who killed you. Oh my God. You're that maniac, aren't you? Oh God! WILL DONOVAN: I'm the maniac? Hey. I got to get out. Leave me alone! Get away from me! [yells] Hey! Hey! I know you're out there. I don't want to hurt you. I just want to talk. I just-- I just want to know why-- why you did it. I'm just glad to see that you're alive. I miss talking to you. I just wanted you to know how I feel. You know, it's all very clear now, you know? It's perfectly clear. I know my wife doesn't love me. I don't love her, but I wouldn't mind getting to know you a little bit better. Even if it wasn't intentional, I-- you know, you're the first person in my life who really made me feel. [door rattles] [beeping] Who is it? Will? Delilah? Look, Will, I know you don't believe me, but-- but all those conversations we had-- I really-- I never intend-- intended it to go that far. I-- and if things were a little different-- if you just open the door, Will. Listen, I really think of you a lot. I do. I think of you a lot. [inaudible] huh? Going somewhere, Jack? What did you do to my husband? What are you talking about? Did you blackmail him? Blackmail him? Took a little money from him. Is that right? You are unbelievable. How? How could you be so stupid? And you were just going to leave with the cash? I thought I could trust you. You're going to ruin everything, you know that? I was this close, this close. The son of a bitch would be dead by now. Oh, he would not be dead by now. He would have if you'd stuck to the plan. Oh, bullshit. All you needed to do was take care of the gunshot. I mean, that was it. You know what? I've been thinking about this. Why did you ever think this guy would commit suicide? I mean, he didn't even know she was dead until I fixed it. What do you mean? What do I mean? I mean, I fixed it. That's what I mean. When he got home, he called the computer. He thought she was still alive. So I found this nice little body. I showed it to your boy. I mean, he was so freaked out he-- It would've worked without all that. I've been working on him for months. I know him. I planned every step of this carefully, and then you go and blackmail him. You didn't think he would get suspicious? You know what? I didn't care. I've got the money. Where is it? Where is it? It's in a safe place. Is that all you care about? I mean, weren't we supposed to leave together? You know, that's another thing. Why in the world would you ever think that I'd go off with you? You're a fucking weasel. A stupid fucking weasel. Why don't you go home? Fuck you. [slap] [slap] Are you gonna shoot-- [gunshot] Oh, Jesus, Jack. Oh, God. Oh, God. [gun thuds] There it is. Wow. What? Blow me right out of Malibu, my man. You really sit up here, huh? [music playing] I want you to tell me something. Was it your idea, or was it Jack's? [struggling] Are we back to that again, Pinocchio? WILL DONOVAN: Just give me that much. It was my idea. WILL DONOVAN: I knew it. I mean, how did he know? I mean, this guy must hate me. I mean, first he sets me up, then he blackmails me, then he steals my wife. I mean, this guy does not fuck around. I'm sorry. Hey. Oh, hi, Will. I have something to say. It's too late. I'm leaving. Oh, I won't stop you from leaving. It's the right thing to do. Really? Why the change? WILL DONOVAN: I've thought about it for a while. Oh, I'm just back for a few things. I have something to tell you. I can't talk about it right this minute. I know you had an affair. He's a criminal. I don't know what you're talking about. Laura, you have to know what I've been going through. And I'm not crazy. Look, not now, will. Laura-- Let me go. --I know what you've been going through. He seduced you. And he's sick. Leave me alone. Really, Will, she doesn't want to talk. Let her go. Who is this woman, Will? Laura, don't be a stranger. Hurts my feelings. Get out of my house! Well, I like it here! Besides, Will and I are a team now. Oh, Laura and I go way back. Shut up! Will, I never saw this woman before in my life. Oh, honey, that is really good. And what about our big plans, schnookems? Huh? Fuck you. Why are you doing this? I don't know. Why are you fucking Jack? Aren't you two supposed to be leading together? I was never going to leave with him. It was bullshit. He was a pig. I just needed him. You know that. It was really cute the way you cut me out of the deal just like that. Will, you mustn't listen to this woman. She's a pathological liar. Isn't she funny, Will? Will, why would I want you to kill yourself, huh? I didn't even know you! Will, please don't believe her. I would never hurt you. I loved you. Loved? That's a strange way to show your love, Laura. She's always doing this. No, I wasn't surprised when she came over and asked me to help her out. You came here just to ruin my life? Listen, missy, he found me. I wasn't going to say anything. Was I, Will? I just couldn't help myself. I wasn't going to leave with Jack. He didn't need to know. It had nothing to do with you. All right, stop. None of this is important to me. Look at her. Look at her, Laura. She was my problem. Look at her. You think I care about that anymore? Huh? I'm through with this, all right? You got it? Good. It's a lie. Whatever she said, it's a lie. It was her. I found out tonight. OK, I was having an affair, but-- but they tried to set me up, too. Will, you have to believe me. I'm your wife, for God's sake. I mean, you're going to believe that trash over your wife? Who the fuck do you think you are, anyway? An out of work, ex-movie star? What a joke. [chuckling] You shut the fuck up. You don't know how much I loathe being a part of your sick, little world. It's so easy, Willie. It's so easy that now I've started, I can't stop. I can't help myself because you're so pathetic. You're so despicable. You make me want to vomit. Just leave, Laura. Just leave. Honey, I feel sorry for you. What are you doing still standing here? Why don't you leave? Why? I'm enjoying myself. Leave. Come on, Laura. Laura! What are you doing? No! [music playing] Everything was almost perfect, and I lost her again. Except, Will, this time she was dead for real. I guess she is, isn't she? What do you know about this man, Jack? I mean, what happened to him? Laura must have killed him, didn't she? She said you killed him, Will. You got to understand, your wife has told us a very credible story here. And yours differs. She's a liar. Ask my mother. Your mother is not here. Did she call yet? No, and she's not going-- Hold it! Would you please listen? Your mother has been dead for eight years. Don't you know that? Did she call yet? Will, look at me. Did you hear what I just said to you? Has she called? She'll call. She'll call soon. She'll fix everything. You sure she didn't call? Wait until my mother calls. She'll know what to do. She'll call soon. You'll see. She'll call. Mother? Mother? I need you. I need you. God, why doesn't she call? Mom! Why doesn't she call?
