Our restaurant "Yagumo", has been taken over by Otaki! Otaki? Is he a member of the Iwabune Family? Yes. I was forced into gambling, and lost the game! so, they took over the restaurant.

How tall was he? How about his face? well, but... - Be quiet! But you don't need to be quiet, little girl! You hate the man who killed your father, don't you? Please be more kind to her. - You! Be quiet! Police Officer! Police Officer! This little girl is very scared. I don't think you should ask her any questions right now. why don't you let me take care of this little girl? Are you from Nihongi? - Yes! I'm owner of Yagumo Restaurant, Kosugi shobei. she is such a sweet girl. Dear, why don't we adopt her? I'm still not well after recovering from my illness, and the doctor told me that I can't bear any more children. well, it was fate that I ran into this little girl today. Her name is Rin, and she is going to be our daughter from now on! Please take good care of her, as well as my son, Ichitaro! Please take care of her. I'm Rin, please take care of me! I don't know my birth mother, and I never had a home. My foster parents loved me so much, and my life in Higo, Kumamoto was like a wonderful dream. However, the more beautiful the dream, the more you face harsh reality when you wake up from it. what are you doing? stop it! sister! They say you're the daughter of a Yakuza! You're an orphan! You're the stray cat of a rotten Yakuza! Go home! Go home! soon we'll be at Kumamoto. Kumamoto! Kumamoto! Kumamoto! Kumamoto-Nihongi How about our guest? Don't worry. He's with Koyoshi. He really likes Koyoshi! I heard that he got ill at Monjin's gambling parlor. At that time, he was drinking too much. He's been drinking ever since he got here. I wonder how he's going to play this time. - He's the famous 'Fudo'noTsune (Immovable Tsune)! when he drinks, he becomes super-human! Go ahead. This game will be very important for the Iwabune Gang. Do you understand? Yes, I understand it very well. This time our guests are all high-rollers. Each bet will be over 5,000 yen. Big Boss said 3%% of the profit would be distributed to us. That's really the main point of the game! Here is a list of our guests for the game. very well. Namba Masa from Osaka, Namba Family. Oh, that will be great! since Namba Masa, the Boss of Osaka, will participate... ...our game will be the biggest in all of Japan! How about the players? Not so impressive. If they face 'Fudo'noTsune, they will lose to his special technique! Good. Young Boss! 'Fudo'noTsune is fine. Koyoshi is doing very well. This is for Koyoshi. Treat her well. Thank you so much, Boss! see you later. I'll see you later, Boss! Koyoshi is so greedy now. That guest is the big player for our game. we have to treat him very well. That's right, isn't it, Young Boss? Young Boss, shouldn't we go to bed soon? why don't you try a little harder? Maybe he'll buy you jewelry or something. I can't stand that woman! why don't you get rid of her? You can't run this place. No. I can do it! Then why don't you fight her? whoever wins the fight, I'll let run Yagumo. Are you sure? I'm serious! sir... I, Koyoshi, would like to ask a favor. Please listen to me! I'll bet on you in this game! I've heard that you're the best player in all of Japan! Now, I've saved 700 yen. I'll use this money as my stake. To make it as big as possible. I want my 700 yen to become 100,000 yen. The 'Premium Bet'... ...has a return of 4 to 5 times! Are you going to give the money to your man? I want to buy back this place Yagumo! Are you going to buy Yagumo back for your man? If my dream comes true, I'll do anything for you. I'll bet my life on this game! Don't walk in the middle, you're a dirty whore! I'm putting my life in this place! who cares about you! Madam, a guest is here! A guest? Yes! May I help you? I'm the Madam. I'm a traveling woman, my name is Jojima Rin. I'm obligated to the former owner of Yagumo. I want to pay my respects and pray since I'm in this town. You look like a Lady Yakuza. I don't believe the former owner had anything to do with your kind of people. wait, please! I suppose the owner should be the Young Boss, Ichitaro-san. The Young Boss is missing. You're supposed to be the Madam of this place, and you don't know where the Young Boss is? It doesn't really make sense, does it? Hey, are you looking for trouble? we have a Young Boss, Otaki-Oyabun in the back. watch your step, or else you'll get hurt! Orin-san! Orin-san, is that you? I'm Yasugoro. The former owner took very good care of me! I'm Yasugoro! see! My hair has become so thin! Oh, Yasugoro-san! Yes! Yes! Don't worry about your money! I'll send it to your hometown! Please work hard, and listen to this Madam! we have a saying, "A decade makes one era", but you became a beautiful woman! Our late Master and Madam would be so happy to see you! Please come! Hey! what's going on here, Yasugoro? Madam, this lady is the daughter of Yagumo! You have to show some respect! Let's go! Let's go! Master! Madam! Orin-san has come back! Look! see what they've done to them! I wonder how do our late Master and Madam see Yagumo from Heaven? In our Kumamoto, we have a lot of great Bosses. But Young Boss Otaki of the Iwabune Family is a murderer. I hate him, but can't do anything about this situation. Father, Mother... the bad girl Orin has finally come home. I can't be proud of who I am, but I have come home. Please don't worry about Ichitaro, he is fine. Orin-san... Our Young Boss? Yasugoro-san. would you do me a favor? - Yes. Are you the one who is a daughter of Yagumo? when I was just a child, the former owner took very good care of me, and at Osaka I accidentally met Yagumo's son, Ichitaro-san. so we came back here together. where is Ichitaro? I can't tell you right now. Otaki-san, I've heard the entire story from Ichitaro-san. I'm a professional gambler called "shiranui Orin". I am someone who lives in the same world as you. I assume that Yagumo is being held as collateral for his debt. I'll be back later to discuss the matter of Ichitaro-san. Excuse me. wait a minute! The rights of ownership for Yagumo expire at month's end! why not ask Yasugoro? wait! wait, please! Can I ask you something? The Young Boss, Ichitaro-san... is he all right? who are you? I work at Yagumo, my name is Koyoshi. Please let me know how he is doing! He's fine. Really? where is he now? May I see him? Please let me see him! Please! I don't know what your relationship is with Ichitaro. But, at this time nobody can see him. Oh, I'm special! Ichitaro-san and I are special! wait! Koyoshi-san, following me won't help you find Ichitaro. Ladies and gentlemen! Our annual playhouse has come to town again! Kumoi Yumenojo Company at Fujisaki Hachiman shrine! This time we'll do "Hyoraku Emaki Tsukigata Hanpeita" by our lead actor, Kumoi Yumenoji... ...I, sawai Kikunosuke, will be... Don't throw your precious daughter into a garbage dump. This isn't much, but it will help you for a while. I'll be taking care of her, so please come back soon. Thank you so much! Thank you so much. Take care of yourself. Yasu-san, you haven't changed a bit. what are you going to do if somebody sees you? Oh, come on! It's too hot and I need a little breeze! Absolutely not! Yasu-san, please let me see Koyoshi! Koyoshi said she'd die with me when I was leaving this town. I know, and I understand very well. I'll take care of it. so, please wait a bit more. Orin-san asked me to watch over you. Please stay here until the game is over. It will only be a day or two more. Boss, your guest is here! so, please don't open the window. Okay? Alright? You just don't know how tough the Iwabune Gang is. so, you have to understand your situation, okay? I don't need a formal greeting. Please be comfortable and show me your face. I'm sorry about this whole situation. well, it's no problem. I've heard the whole story from seino. I'll join the game that you set up. Yes. I replied to them that I'd be at the game as soon as I received your letter. I want to make sure that you'll be my player for this game. Yes, Oyabun-san, if you let me. That's great! Your profit will be 40%% and I think that is enough. Yes, and thank you so much! This is for your from the Boss. It's ready to wear. You've prepared everything for me. By the way, seino, who will be the player for the Iwabune Family? I've heard that it will be Murai Tsunejiro. 'Fudo'noTsune! 'Fudo'noTsune? Do you know him? No... I don't. well, he's a pretty tough player. I've been with you for almost 5 years. I want to make some big money. Tsune-san. Please don't drink before the game. we should think about our futures, you know. Isn't that right, Tsune-san? Young Boss. what? we got this notice from Namba Masa announcing a player. Alright. Jojima Rin? Isn't Jojima Rin the 'shiranui' Orin? Yes. By the way, we found out where Ichitaro is hiding. Do you understand? I didn't even tell Orin-san about this. Don't be long. Our lives could be in danger. Okay? Koyoshi! Young Boss! It's been 6 months... ...I really missed you... ...I've never forgotten the promise that we made. Orin! You think you can take revenge on me. The way you set it all up with backing from Namba Masa. But I'm the one who will fight you in this game! There is no chance that you will win this game! You have to understand the reality, alright? I'll beat the hell out of you and the goddess on your back! Hold on! I don't believe it! A great player like you came all the way down here just to tell me this garbage! Orin, please understand this is the way I am. I want you to really hate me before the game. when you have a great rage towards me, then you'll be a much better player to fight with me. This is my mercy for you. Look, Orin! You'll hate me even more, now that you've seen this! Hey, would you get me some sak?? Yes. Please, can you forgive them? They are really in love! They're young and innocent. Please be kind to them... ...Please... Koyoshi, you'll pay for this! Lock her in the warehouse! Hey, let her go! Help me... I'm being chased! Brothers! Our theatre is already closed. Did you see a young guy? what? I'm not your watchman. Please wait until after the festival has ended for the investigation of this kind of murder. I can't investigate before that. Alright? Pardon me. Is an Orin-san here? Yes. we can't call anybody. so we took care of his wounds by ourselves. Ichitaro! Our leader will be here soon. sister... ...sister... The Boss from Isozaki. Yes. well, Otaki! Osaka's Namba Masa will be here, right? Yes. I've heard that he says "...Coal is Japan's future!" ...and he has a lot of interest in Kyushu! Perhaps by coming to this game he hopes to make some connection with Kyushu. Everyone. Namba Masa-san is here. well, well! Thank you very much! Iwabune, it seems like a great game! we're very proud of this game. Please. Thank you. Everyone, here is my player for this game, Jojima Rin. Let me introduce myself to everybody. Coming across the Kanmon strait, this is my first visit to Kyushu as a professional player. I am Jojima Rin. I'm still immature in this world. But, please make me your acquaintance from now on. Great! Great! Nice introduction! I like it! I look forward to seeing your battle with 'Fudo'noTsune! Orin-san. Our players for this game are all the best of the best. Good luck to you. Everyone. The player is sawamoto Takichi from the Mitsuyama Family! Ready? Go! It's done. Please bet! Please bet! Please bet! we're ready! Ready! Game! 'Peony'! The new player is Jojima Rin from the Namba Masa Family! It's done. Please bet! Please bet! we're ready! - Not yet! Ready! Game! 6 of 'Chrysanthemum'. Get me more money from Osaka, right away! How much did you bet on Orin? I don't know. we're throwing our money into the trashbin! we are having an intermission. The money will be here soon. Not good... He is really different from ordinary players. Boss Isozaki has already withdrawn from the game. we shouldn't press our luck and better leave the game, Boss. Fool! Oh, sorry to keep you waiting. Inazawa. - Yes. He came to see our game. Inazawa Ryukichi is my name. I'm Hashiba shinkichi. Pleased to meet you. Until you came to introduce 'Fudo'noTsune, our Boss had planned to use him as our player. Oh, I'm so sorry. Don't worry about it. Nobody can beat Murai Tsunejiro. By the way, Tsunejiro-san is leading the top. That's great. I'd like to watch and learn from this opportunity. It was the night of this Hachiman shrine festival. I killed the player who was with his little girl. I killed him right in front of his little girl. I could have let him go... ...since he was such a small-time cheat. Maybe he wanted to buy some clothes for his little girl. It's a bad story. I guess I was possessed by the devil. Ever since that night, the devil sits right across from me, every time I play. Aren't you the little girl from that night? Orin. Don't you want to kill me? Excuse me. The devil has been my companion as well, on a long journey through life. I accept everything as my fate, and I've thrown away my past a long time ago! Orin... - Please don't say anymore! The final game is not over yet! Orin! Be more relaxed, as if you were a windmill. Let yourself flow with the wind. The player who is leading the top, will be Murai Tsunejiro from the Iwabune Family! How was it? I thought 'Fudo'noTsune would win straight through, but it wasn't like that! How about Orin? - Yes, Orin! she came back to the game like a tornado! I can't believe that she had lost a lot in the beginning! Now, it's the title match between Orin and Tsunejiro! Orin will be the winner! I, Bushu, guarantee it! Old man! How do you know that? My instinct! Okay, I'll bet on Orin! Me, too! - Me, too! Me, too! - Me, too! - Shut up! I'll bet everything on 'Fudo'noTsune! Ready! Do you want to limit the bet? I'll take it as unlimited. well, what confidence you have to say "unlimited". Now, I'll stake my pride as Namba Masa, and bet another 1,000,000 yen. Game! 'Rain'! 2 of 'Rain'! Everybody! Thank you so much. You read my mind very well this time. I completely lost to you. Orin-san, what are you going to do with Yagumo? well, it will be Kosugi Ichitaro's decision, and I've nothing to do with it. That's great! You really did it for that stupid kid! Hey, I'm also watching this matter. If you cheat innocent people like him again, I won't forgive you! You have to remember... ...you won't be so lucky again! - what did you say? - wait! Orin-san, let's go. Get 10 armed men. Let's do it! Alright, what he really wants is Kurodaiya's business. This is a great opportunity to get rid of him. Don't let him cross the Kanmon strait. what a great thing for you, Young Boss! Don't ever get involved with gambling again, and do your best with the business. sister... ...I can't. Ichitaro... It's my fault that Yasu-san got killed. How can I be happy after that? Please understand me, sister... ...Yagumo is yours. Do with it as you please. I see. I understand, Ichitaro. I'll do with it as I wish. we'll talk after a while. Okay? This gave me good luck. I'll give it to you until we see each other again. Here. Chief, would you keep him here for a while, please? Yes, sure. But how about you? I have more business to take care of. Are you going to deal with the Iwabune family? I'm not going to fight them. But I have to keep an eye on them, at least during the days while they're returning Yagumo. Ichitaro, in time we can get support from the Namba Masa Family. so, hold on. Okay? Don't move from this place, alright? will you promise? Namba Masa is having a good time here! He's going back by boat. Let's kill him in the boat! what about 'Fudo'noTsune? He's been drinking all day long. Oyabun, I'm so sorry! Here is my apology! what's this? You think you'll be forgiven with this crap? Hey, Inazawa! Tsune can play a trick, can't he? No! It's impossible for him to do that kind of thing! At a place like that... ...nobody can get away with anything! Yes, he can. Because he is 'Fudo'noTsune. what do you mean? He read Orin's mind. I was watching his cards all the way through to the end. It's impossible to draw the same cards 3 hands in a row. Yet, that's what 'Fudo'noTsune did in the final game. That's not true! Oyabun! If you believed what he said, why didn't you tell us at the end of the game? Tsune was observed talking to Orin during the intermission! what? Anyway, do you want to live a little while longer? Then, there is only one way. Inazawa, kill Orin! Orin? Both you and Tsune will have your lives spared. Hurry up and go! Orin is still in the area. we can't go back. Otherwise, I'll kill you! Orin-san, was he your father? Yes, he was. But why are you here? well, I want to say thank you. That was a good game. I felt so good upon hearing how you did it. was he a gambler, too? Yes. He taught me everything as we traveled around the country. That's why you can play so well in a situation as intense... ...as that game, right? Are you also a gambler? Once... when I was a young man ...a long time ago... I played. Orin-san! I'm sorry! But I have to straighten things out for my people! Die, please! what do you mean, straighten things out? Did Otaki send you here? shut up! shut up! Don't worry. It was just a fight between bums like us. But, you have to be careful, Orin-san. wait, please! This? Please use it for your own protection. It won't change anything if I turn myself in to the police. By the way, Orin-san... Please take care of yourself, and become a notable person. It's nice to have a woman like you in this world. so long. Oh, Madam. Have you come here to kill me? I came here to help you. Help me? Don't take it wrong. I didn't want to put you in here. They discovered that Ichitaro is hiding in a Playhouse nearby, and they're going to kill him. They shouldn't kill him. Don't you agree? You see... ...I'm not such an evil woman. I just can't stand it anymore! I'm a human being, too... ...you know. Besides, I have no business with Yagumo anymore. This is the address where your man is waiting for you. why don't you go there now? Go! what a big liar! It must have taken a lifetime of practice, to become such a perfect liar. Yagumo is mine, and I'll do anything for it! why don't you shut up? You're just a dirty whore! Don't make me laugh! Koyoshi! Koyoshi! Koyoshi! Oh, Young Boss! Koyoshi... How have you been? why did you come here? How about you? I got a note from my sister to wait here. Koyoshi... ...who told you about me being here? It was Yagumo's Madam. well, thank you for coming! Now, I want the two of you to commit 'Double suicide'. what did you say? I'm so sorry, Orin-san! I'm the one who took Ichitaro to Hachiman shrine Playhouse! If I had known, I never would have brought him to... you know! I... I... The police said it was a typical 'Double suicide' lovers commit. But, there must have been somebody else behind it! Ichitaro. Ichitaro! Please forgive me! You wouldn't have ended up like this, if I had let you come travel with me like you wanted, right? Everything is my fault! I'm the one who brought bad luck to Yagumo! I regret so much that the former owner of Yagumo gave me mercy almost 20 years ago. what is love? what is a family? A fool like me should have ended up on the street! I should burn this deed. Take-san. - Yes. would you get me funeral clothing, please? Yes. Orin! Otaki is waiting for you at Yagumo. He has 10 armed men there waiting to fight you. A woman can't fight alone. You'll be killed right away. Tsunejiro-san, I don't need any help. why don't we just fight each other as murderers? I just made your friend die a little while ago. Ryukichi? very well. I'll wait for you at Yagumo, Orin. Oh, by the way, there is dynamite in the warehouse behind Mt. Bota. You see, a festival needs big firecrackers. Take-san, once I pass this gate, my descent into Hell begins. Good people can't go beyond this gate. what are you doing here? I came to make a formal greeting again. I owed the former owner of Yagumo a great deal, and I brought big incense for him this time. what is that? As you can see, shiranui Orin, who grew up in the south, is now a Fire Devil! Along with Yagumo, which has lost its owners, you will all burn to ashes! I'll pray for you, so all of you go to Hell! As you can see, I took your advice. You! Are you betraying us? That's right. For the first time, I have truly loved a woman! I'm going to die for this woman! Orin! This is for Ichitaro! Tsunejiro-san! Please don't die! Orin-san... ...you did very well... ...You really did win the final game... Because you helped me! I don't think Ichitaro will be happy even if I kill all of them! But at least, I can face him when I die! Don't die! ...Please don't die... ...I think I did very well as a man in my last moments... ...I'm holding the woman I love... ...what a lucky man I am... ...Orin! I'm so sorry about your father... ...Please forgive me. Tsunejiro-san! Tsunejiro-san! I can't believe it. Everything in this world is upside down! why do the people who should live, have to die... ...and people who should die, are left behind to live?
