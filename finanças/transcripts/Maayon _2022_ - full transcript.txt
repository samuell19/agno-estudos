Praise be to Lord Krishna! (Priest utters Sanskrit hymn) O Sacred Eagle! Get going. The temple is about to close, Murthy. Let's go home. You go on, uncle. I'll stay the night to watch what happens. Don't blabber, you idiot! Get going. Why are you scared? I'll record what happens here and put it on YouTube. See how it goes viral! Quit sounding like a lunatic! Do what I say. Do not play around with God. Got it? Murthy? My boy... Has everyone left? -Yes, sire. Murthy is missing, sire! He must have gone home. No! He was blabbering about wanting to spend the night here. What are you saying? Murthy! Murthy! Dear boy! Murthy! Murthy! Murthy! We've looked everywhere, but couldn't find Murthy, sire! "When oneâ€™s doom approaches, their minds fail them." "Deaths continue in the archaeology sector." "Will the mystery be solved?" "The Crime Report!" "Over the past few years, there's been a string of deaths among archaeologists." "All the victims had been studying ancient statues." "That their deaths happened under similar circumstances..." "...and that the autopsies revealed no apparent cause of death..." "...has everyone shocked." "Rumors are spreading among the public that these deaths were caused..." "...by mystical powers emanating out of ancient divine idols." "Archaeologists bring to light the dark chapters of history." "Who will bring to light the mystery of their deaths?" "When will the mystery clear up?" C6 to E5. H3 to G4. F6 to G4. F3 to E5. H5 to H2. Checkmate. Wow! How do you do it, sir? Without even looking at the board... Chess is a game you play in the opponent's mind. Not just a board game. Chess was invented in India as a means to teach war strategies. Warfare is based on deception. Deceit and betrayal. These form the basis of war. Even before meeting the enemy on the battlefield, we must win over their mind. We must appear near when actually far, and afar when actually near. Depending on circumstances, we must be ready to adapt. Attack, when unprepared. Attack the enemy when they least expect it. Many lives have been lost in order to protect war plans. An archaeologist's job is to dig out such well protected ancient secrets. Knowing merely what metal a weapon is made of... ...can tell us the period and dynasty it belongs to. This dagger is from the Pallava era. It was found in Kanchipuram. It was wielded by Nandivarman II. An archaeological site is like a crime scene. Every piece of evidence is vital. Having chosen this field, you must be very passionate about history. Only after getting down into the trenches, knowing the land, researching... ...studying inscriptions and discussing with experts... ...we can learn the true history. So, your work is not just about digging up sand and rocks. It involves even digging up our past culture. But sadly, the antiques we work hard to dig up are sold abroad illegally. So, you have a huge responsibility in society. Bring him in. Okay, sir. Wow! Beautiful statue! Where did you dig this up? That's not your concern. I'm sorry. - I want its market price and other details. Sure, sir. I can do it. My job not only involves digging up that which is buried. But also burying anyone who tries digging up on me. This emergency meeting has been set up... ...because a task that involves multiple departments has come our way. Idol smuggling mafias with international ties... ...have long been operating out of India. Recently, a lot of idol smuggling is going on via Sri Lanka and Dubai. Some in our department are involved smuggling out our antiques. The statues smuggled so far are worth several billions. There is a leader for these idol smuggling mafias. His name is Sans Ferraro. He conducts this business as if he were a wizard. He finishes small dealings through men in his network. Per intelligence reports, he only shows up in person... ...for the most prized artifacts. Every undercover agent we have sent so far, have somehow had their covers blown. Sans Ferraro's network may be responsible for the suspicious deaths of these agents. Many such accidental deaths have occurred in the countries where he operates. We must put an end to these thefts and deaths. If we trap him, we can apprehend his entire network. And we can recover every antique we have lost. So, who'll take the lead? Sir I will take the responsibility. After a long time, it feels like a taste of my mother's cooking. I need to give her something... We don't need anything... -It's okay! No, sir. -This is a gift for aunty... Sorry... it's a gift for my mother! Thank you very much, sir. All this is because of you. Don't worry, sire. Everything is for God, right? Even the statue in there has gotten old. I can make it a new one. Devaraj? -Product will be ready in a week. Okay. But I'll need much more older versions. There's plenty of demand for it. We'll make it happen. Good. We'll do that. Partner! Arjun! The antiques we work hard to dig up are sold abroad illegally. Even before meeting the enemy on the battlefield, we must win over their mind. Take notes! A five metal idol. Nineteen inches tall. Must weigh around fifteen kilograms. Going by the carving style, it must be around 600 years old. Based on its antique value... It'll go for millions in the grey market. I want a duplicate of this. -Sure! Excellent, Arjun! Pulled it off without a hitch! The original goes abroad. The duplicate goes to our temple here. Be it a small or a big job, the risk involved is the same, right? Why don't we try something bigger? I wanted to discuss that with you. One of my contacts is Sans Ferraro. He's an international agent. He's the premier buyer of statues. He's made a strong offer. What's the offer? He's asked for a very ancient statue. If I get it, can you duplicate it? You fix the price, partner. I'll get the statue. "Hello guys. We know by heart since school that the value of Pi..." "...is 22 divided by 7, or 3.14." "But many of us do not understand what exactly 3.14 is." "That's what we'll cover today." "I have a pizza." "I'm going to measure its diameter with a thread." "I place a thread length 3.14 times the diameter around the pizza." "I get a complete circle." "To state it simply..." "The circumference of a circle divided by its diameter, is Pi." "That is 3.14." "Whether it's big or small, a round wheel or the spherical moon..." "...or a cylindrical water can..." "...they all have the same value: 3.14." Partner in crime! Listen carefully to what I have to say. (Maayon Hill) I'm at the Maayon Hill excavation site. 30 kilometres from Pudukkottai. Situated a kilometre from the site, is the ancient temple of Pallikonda Krishna. The town itself is two kilometres from the temple. Close to the site is another temple the ASI took over, despite public protests. Only now has it come completely under our control. In the temple, I opened a door that had stayed shut for long... ...and found palm leaf manuscripts and copper plates. When experts decoded those manuscripts... ...I learned about a huge secret room at the Pallikonda Krishna temple. This is the big project we've been waiting for so long, Arjun! Get ready to come to the site. Who is in charge of the site? Vasudevan. Oh no! That man is trouble. We can't move a single piece under his watch. You move the pieces. I'll handle the rest. But how can I gain entry there? In two days, you'll get good news through an official order. The higher officials are staying in the village. You can stay at the excavation site with the team. The villagers won't disturb you there. Hello! Got no sense? Watch where you're going! It's just a pot. Someone tossed it after a drink. What? "A pot"? As if walking in uninvited wasn't enough... Who let you in here? Can't you put up a board outside, DK? He's the new senior expert, Anjana. You talk without respect, huh? Collect the details captured there. -Yes, sir. Be patient. -I don't care who he is. He doesn't even know to walk carefully at a site. Don't vouch for him. Top of that, those damn sunglasses! Stay calm. -Anjana! What's the problem there? Sir! Why this needless argument? -Quiet! Hello, sir. I'm Arjun. Arjun Manimaran. So you're him! The head office informed me about you. Come! Come on in, Arjun. He's Mr. Devaraj, the Senior Director. -Hello. He's Mr. Madan, the painting expert from Thanjavur University. Hi. -Hi. She is Anjana. The epigraphist. We already know each other, sir. For how long? We just met outside. Saw her outside, huh? Did you see him there too? -No. Don't pay attention to men, eh? Where is that coin, Devaraj? Here it is. Send this coin to the lab, DK. I want the report. How long will it take? If sent today, three days. -Then send it right away. Copper. About three grams. Image of a standing man on one side. A bird on the other. A hairbun on the head. So... a female bird? It hails from the medieval Chola period. I think... the reign of Rajendra Chola. So, this coin is from early 11th century. Applaud, everyone! Arumugam! -Sir? I told you to ready a tent for one Mr. Arjun, yes? Take him to it. Yes, sir. Hello, son. How was the trip? -Hello. A very powerful temple, son. Can we go there now? -We can't go there after sunset. If we do, we will go mad. Even our lives may get in danger. It's not good, son. You stay here. I'll get your luggage. Quite the hype! What would have been the purpose of this thing, sir? A spittoon. I'll hold it away. Even dogs are mating in this cold month of Margazhi. Shall I go break them up? You'll never get married. Cool? As if I ever will if I hang out with you! The smell of jasmine! The sound of anklets! Who is this belle? My dream angel! Who are you? Who cares? Quiet! -A man gets your dinner every day, yes? Yes. Arumugam. -I'm his daughter. So you're the ones who find statues? All these years, we went searching and found statues. Tonight, a statue has found us! Damn... he's proving to be an 80s kid! You'll never get her! Here you go. Not washed your hands? We only just started! How could I already? You're quite the talker! I like people like that! What's your name, dear? Vaani! Here to steal my heart, honey? Chat with you any longer, and I'll laugh myself to death! We'll laugh to death. But we can't laugh after our deaths. I can't bear this nonsense! But I will laugh! I'll return as a ghost and laugh! As a ghost? Why? Are you scared of ghosts? "Am I scared of ghosts?" If ghosts are as beautiful as you, I will happily marry one even! See you! You're making a huge mistake! No. I'm scoring big. Come, Arjun! What's up, partner? -Vasudevan returns in two days. This is the right time to make plans. Look what's written here! "900 years ago, in Vijayanandapuram..." "During the reign of King Achutha Rayar, there was a severe drought!" "People starved, unable to get even a square meal a day!" "The King fell ill and was confined to his bed." "His son, Arjuna Rayar, ascended the throne as king..." "...performed a sacrificial ritual at the temple..." "...travelled 300 miles with his army..." "...and waged a war against the people of Kodugu Hills." "He split his army into three groups..." "...and attacked them from several directions!" "In the six days of war, Arjuna Rayar defeated the local king..." "...and returned home with 1,400 elephants, 20,000 horses and many gold ornaments!" "After the glorious victory, he began to serve his people." "This ancient temple of Lord Krishna, that was instrumental to his victory..." "...he renovated extensively and held a magnificent consecration event!" When Arjuna Rayar was renovating the Krishna temple... ...he built a secret room to stash away all the remaining wealth. Besides gold ornaments... ...coins hailing from Rome and Greece, as well as that of Lord Ashoka... ...are all in there, Arjun! Partner! You nailed it! You're in a league of your own! You need to find out where the secret room is and how to open it. We'll get in! I'm here, aren't I? Come on in! They'll be working with us on this project. Wasn't it just us both, all this time? Don't you trust me anymore? Nothing like that. They were the ones who decoded the details of the secret room. Each of them have contributed to this project from the start. You'll certainly need their help. This is a once in a lifetime deal! If we get it, we're all settled for life! A world just for us, where we reign supreme! We can get whatever we want! Okay. Now on, Arjun is your boss! What do we do, boss? (Deaths continue at the Department of Archaeology) Vasudevan has sent over a list of suspects. Why can't we just arrest the suspect? In this matter, we can't just clip off the branches. We need to uproot it entirely! For that, we need solid evidence. Tap those on the list. Hack them too, if you have to. Okay, sir. I'll do the needful. -Thank you. Hi. -Hey. This is the blueprint we found in the temple. What's that? -A Lidar scanner. Open Lidar's app. Okay. Okay... This temple's architecture isn't as simple as we thought. It's very unique. Look at this. Here's the west side of the temple. The device identifies a tunnel here. That secret room must be under the sanctum sanctorum of the main deity. Holy cow. 'If we keep searching, the truth will come to light' 'The past that has gone by will come alive before our eyes' 'If we keep searching, the truth will come to light' 'The past that has gone by will come alive before our eyes' 'If we keep searching, the truth will come to light' 'The past that has gone by will come alive before our eyes' 'If we keep searching, the truth will come to light' 'The past that has gone by will come alive before our eyes' 'Wherever you go, flowers bloom into a garden' 'The fragrance in the wind, will sing a welcome ode' 'If we keep searching, the truth will come to light' 'The past that has gone by will come alive before our eyes' 'Like the truth hidden in the inner recess of the heart...' '...is there a price to the treasure buried deep under the Earth?' 'Like the truth hidden in the inner recess of the heart...' '...is there a price to the treasure buried deep under the Earth?' 'Like the truth hidden in the inner recess of the heart...' '...is there a price to the treasure buried deep under the Earth?' 'Not all that is buried, is treasure' 'Not all that is treasure, is something new' 'Shall I tell you what lies in the heart?' 'Shall I unite my heart with yours?' 'That which was alone, softly merges with its better self' 'If we keep searching, the truth will come to light' 'The past that has gone by will come alive before our eyes' 'If we keep searching, the truth will come to light' 'The past that has gone by will come alive before our eyes' 'Wherever you go, flowers bloom into a garden' 'The fragrance in the wind, will sing a welcome ode' 'If we keep searching, the truth will come to light' 'The past that has gone by will come alive before our eyes' Give me that. Nothing in the palm leaves or inscriptions... ...gives enough details about the temple's secrets. There are no more places left to search. Where then is the clue to the treasure? The evidence for the secret room must be in the temple's inner sanctum. To enter it, we need permission from the temple's patron. Who is he? -Krishnappa Nayakkar. His family has been safeguarding the temple and its secrets for generations. It's not easy to get his permission. In fact, he runs his own government in this town. We need to deal with this through Mr. Vasudevan. Alright. Let's have Mr. Vasudevan talk to him. But, this permission is just a formality. What the hell is this? -Herbal extract! Don't serve tea or coffee, eh? Sir... Hello, sir. It's a pleasure to meet you. Are you well? Have a seat. -Yes, sir. How goes your research, sir? Very well, thanks to your support. What's up, Vasudevan? We have studied the inscriptions on the outside of the temple. The inner sanctum is all that's left. If you permit us, we'll study the inscriptions in there as well. No one is allowed inside the inner sanctum. This is a government project, sir. How can you say no? We can't change the temple tradition to suit your needs. What era are you in, sir? In an age where satellites are sent to Mars, you won't let us into a room? Divine energy must be felt. It must not be studied. -All true, but... Modern science explains all. From the universe's origin to the smallest atom. "The one who slices up the tiniest atom..." "The one who seeks the soul of the finest particle..." "To them will be revealed, the Ultimate." 1,000 years ago, Sage Thirumoolar proclaimed atoms keep the universe alive. Your modern science just discovered that after spending billions. Even at CERN, which you claim to be the world's finest research centre... ...they keep a statue of Lord Nataraja. Do not underestimate the intellect of our ancestors. We're just here as a mere formality, but you give us a sermon? The sacred offering is ready. Have some before you go. Everyone hypes up this temple, sir. Why wouldn't they? It has a history that dates back 5,000 years. Why do they claim people go insane if they stay back after 6 PM? That's because there are too many loons let loose. Quit kidding around, sir. That's why I brought this out. Just standing idle, right? Hold this. "Thousands of corpses lie battered and bloodied." "Vultures swoop down from the skies to pick at the rotting flesh." "In the inferno, the heaped corpses stiffen, their bravery unquenched." "Jackals, dizzy from the scent of blood, split the air with their terrifying howls." "It is a sight of gore, at the battlefield of Kurukshetra!" "Gandhari, who lost her one hundred children there..." "...curses Krishna that just as she suffers her loss..." "...his entire clan would be annihilated before his very eyes." "Heartbroken with Gandhari's curse, Krishna comes to the Maayon Hills." "In sorrow, he sits under a tree and plays the flute." "The Gandharvas, who were passing across the sky at the moment, hear it..." "...and create music of their own to comfort Krishna." "The music of the Gandharvas fills Krishna with ecstasy." It is believed that every night since then, at the temple... ...the Gandharvas play music that captivates Lord Krishna. The town also believes that the same music makes humans go insane. Arjun What do you think about our team? They are talented. They do as their told. They give me whatever I ask them. The mission will be a success. After that, it will be up to you to monetize it. That's my expertise. Within an hour of mission completion, the money will come in. Who's the buyer? Ferrari or Lamborghini or something, right? I have many types of buyers. Sans Ferraro usually buys only statues. Let him be whoever. I don't care. We'll deliver the goods to those who are good to us. Welcome everyone, who came to watch! Allirani's tale will send shivers down your spine! As Princess Allirani was tormented by the demon... ...she summoned Lord Krishna to come save her. "I am in trouble, O Krishna... Save me!" As she prayed so, Lord Krishna appeared out of thin air! He handed her the Somavalli flowers to give to the demon. The demon felt dizzy and fainted... -Welcome, dear boy! When did you come? -Just now. Have a seat. -What's the occasion? The temple festival happens next week. This entire week is filled with festivities. He is my relative. Works with the minister. Hello. Care for something to eat? -No, I'm good. Have 'panakam'. It's delicious. Bring over some 'panakam'! -Bring it! Here you go, sir. -Thanks. Yes, sir. So... you went to meet the temple patron, right? How did it go? Don't ask! Why won't he give us permission to go in? How would he? It's no ordinary temple, son. Seen the hill behind the temple? It had broke off from the great Mount Sanjivani! Lots of herbs grow there. As Sage Agathiyar meditated there, it is also known as Agathiyar Hills. Thanks to the temple and the hill, no one in town ever falls ill. Then, why do such occurrences happen at night? Leads to insanity, son! Why tell ghost stories, sir? Like it would happen inside a temple! From then to now, such scepticism is what had caused... ...those who went into the temple after dusk, to come out insane at dawn. This is just some fiction! Have you actually seen it happen? A few years ago, without telling anyone, a man went in, wanting to do research. The next morning, he was found at the pond, in a stupor. He had this paper with him. How did you get this? He was my father. He had drawn the last thing he had seen. The mystic events in this temple are beyond imagination, son. 'O Dusky Lord Krishna' 'O Precious One' 'O Dusky Lord Krishna' 'O Wise One' 'Seeking refuge, we surrender at thy feet' 'Seeking refuge, we surrender at thy feet' 'Besides thee, there is no other sanctuary' 'Besides thee, there is no other sanctuary' 'Besides thee, there is no other sanctuary' 'Besides thee, there is no other sanctuary' 'O Dusky Lord Krishna' 'O Precious One' 'O Guardian of Truth... O Eternal Flame...' 'O Guardian of Truth... O Eternal Flame...' 'Can those devoid of honour stroll with their heads held high?' 'Can those devoid of honour stroll with their heads held high?' 'Can those who worship thee bow low and cower down?' 'Can those who worship thee bow low and cower down?' 'Then, now, and forever... Hasn't this always happened? 'Does this seem right? Is this the fate ordained by thee?' 'Not a tiny speck moves without thy assent' 'Do as thine heart says' 'Who will bring to thee our tale of woes?' 'O Dusky Lord Krishna' 'O Precious One' 'Lying on the majestic serpent under the celestial ocean of milk...' 'Thou bring ashore those who grapple in the ocean of worldly ties' 'Lying on the majestic serpent under the celestial ocean of milk...' 'Thou bring ashore those who grapple in the ocean of worldy ties' 'Despite being in a state of divine slumber...' 'Despite being in a state of divine slumber, thou are omniscient' 'Thou embrace and protect us from all worldly sorrows' 'Sinners thrive... yet, thou are at rest' 'As they try to loot thy temple...' '...is it right for thou to slumber so?' 'O Dusky Lord Krishna' 'O Precious One' 'O Dusky Lord Krishna' 'O Wise One' 'Seeking refuge, we surrender at thy feet' 'Seeking refuge, we surrender at thy feet' 'Besides thee, there is no other sanctuary' 'Besides thee, there is no other sanctuary' 'O Dusky Lord Krishna' 'O Precious One' 'O Narayana' 'Krishnaya Govinda Narayana' 'O Narayana' Looks like he might bury us tonight, brother! Don't be scared! I'm here for you! He's broken our leader too! You don't even measure up to my hip. and you want to bury me? Beat it! What brings you to town all of a sudden, sire? There is no task without reason. For every task, there is an outcome. To change the outcome... ...conduct a Sudharshana ritual on the night of the Rohini star. Yes, sire. 'O Handsome Lover... O Dusky Lord Krishna' 'O Handsome Lover... O Dusky Lord Krishna' -They are here to see you, sire. Have a seat. 'O Handsome Lover' -What's the occasion? I'll tell you, son. Since the era of Arjuna Rayar, this festival takes place every year... ...on the night of Lord Krishna's birth star. 'O Handsome Lover... O Divine Flutist' Every year, four pots are hung up... ...and a boy in Lord Krishna's costume is asked to smash the right one. Only one of the four pots contain butter. Not once has the wrong pot been smashed. Only the one containing butter is always broken. O Krishna! We believe Lord Krishna himself descends upon the boy and breaks the pot. O Krishna! 'O Handsome Lover... O Divine Beauty' 'O Dusky Lord Krishna... O Handsome Lover...' 'O Dusky Lord Krishna... O Handsome Lover...' Having not played the flute since leaving Mathura to go to Dwaraka... ...Lord Krishna arrived at the Maayon Hill and played it for the last time. It is our town's belief that he left his flute here. Based on what we could draw from these palm manuscripts... ...we learnt something. Look at this. The snake on this door is the serpent Kalingan. It lived on the shores of river Yamuna during Krishna's time. The myth says that Krishna tamed it by dancing upon its head. The townsfolk believe the serpent still goes around the temple... ...and protects the place at night. This secret door is sealed by the Snake Lock. The palm script says it will open upon chanting the Garudan hymn. Those hymns are known only to Krishnappa Nayakkar's family... ...and a few mystics. Then let's just ask him! Does one ask the owner the key to rob his house? Then let's break the door! No? His damn mouth must be broken! Is there no other way? There is. Look at this. The Strategic Wheel! It is the key! Look at that hollow. That is the Snake Lock. Place the Strategic Wheel upon it, the door will open. This Strategic Wheel is somewhere inside the temple. We need to look for the clue. I'd rather get a bank loan and settle abroad! When are we executing the plan? There will be a solar eclipse in seven days. The temple will be shut all day. We'll enter that morning. We need to finalize the details. We meet here tomorrow at the same time. Okay? What is it, Arjun? Nothing. Remember what I said? It's coming along smoothly. I've confirmed that a 5,000 year old flute is hidden in the Krishna temple. My team believes there's only some buried treasure. Make arrangements to sell the flute separately. If anyone gets in the way, I'll handle it. Understood. -Yeah. Let Arjun recover the flute first. Let it come to our hands. After that... ...we'll finish him. What's up, Devaraj? Have you reached Colombo? I am already here! Cross the sea and come out to Pudukkottai. You can see the sea of wonders! It's just an overnight journey for me. When do you want me there? Very soon. -Ciao! A snake! It's just a rope. Always freaking out over snakes... Just a rope, huh? -You'll die from snakebite some day! Sans Ferraro's sources found out Krishna's Flute is hidden in the temple. He's coming for it personally. You believe these fables too? I don't believe in fables. I believe in him. We're going into the temple, anyway. If it's in there, I'll retrieve it. Not 'if it's in there'. You will retrieve it. 'Hide and seek... Find out where we are' "This is RJ Bhushitha." "You're listening to 'When do we realize this is God's play?'" "But let's not go into the spiritualism vs. science debate." "But this song has a huge connect with this day." "Today is March 14." "The birthday of scientist extraordinaire Albert Einstein." "It's also when Lord Krishna was born under the reigning Rohini star." "A day laced with scientific and spiritual undertones." "If one believes, it's spiritual. If not, it's science. It's that simple." Height is 6.5 inches. Noted it? -Yes, sir. Vasudevan! Welcome, Mr. Minister. Greetings! -Greetings! Please sit. -How are you? You please sit. Please step outside boys. I'll call you back. Step out. What brings you here so sudden... Should I not come? -Of course, you can! How goes the work? It's going well, sir. You've hooked a big one, huh? "Hooked a big one?" Seems you've found a secret room in the temple. "Secret room?" What is this? "Secret room?" There's no such thing. Who is this gentleman? -Mr. Devaraj. My second-in-command. Please wait outside. Oh no! He's a senior officer. So he cannot step out? By all means. -Please step out. I'll call you back. I don't get what you're saying, sir. Mr. Vasudevan... Appears you found a secret room in the temple. We've received a complaint that you intend to steal all the jewellery in there. So, the revenue department is coming to inspect the temple tomorrow. You need to cooperate with us. We are civil servants, sir. We must be loyal to the government! Whatever is in there, we'll give 10% of it to the government. Give me the remaining 90%. You'll definitely get the share that's your due! Don't get caught flying solo, Vasudevan! You may need our support in the future. I believe you understand. Shall I take your leave? See you. -Be well! Hello? Where are you, man? My job here is done. -Uncle! Yeah, they are shaken. -Uncle! I've handled it, uncle. Everything will fall in place. I'll speak to the minister and get you an award. Are you happy? I don't need an award, my boy. I'm content with our town's temple being safe. That's no problem at all. Don't worry. I'll handle it. The minister's leaving. See you. All our hard work will be in vain! After the revenue department seizes it all, we can't do squat! We have only one option. We need to execute the plan tonight! No devotee dares to go into the temple after 6 PM. And you want to risk going in? Do you believe those tales? -100%! Thousands of crores, DK! Does it matter how much? One needs to be alive to enjoy it! You go. I'm not coming! -Damn it, DK! What do you think? Are you scared, Arjun? If we don't risk it all tonight, we'll just be digging up sand for life! I'm not ready for that! I will make sure we go in and safely retrieve the item. How will we trade it? They're all antiques. Should there be any trouble selling it, we'll all end up in jail! That's no big deal. I'll have Sans come in tomorrow. Once you retrieve the item, get it to him. He'll handle the rest. For the next two months, it'll be business as usual. Then, we settle down for good. We have no clue about the Strategic Wheel! We need to head in and get it! Are you kidding? There'll be no one at the temple after 6 PM. It'll reopen at 6 AM tomorrow. We have twelve solid hours. Can't we crack it by then? Do you know how risky this is? You got a better idea? Exactly! I'm in. I'm already in. -Perfect. Once you finish the job, head to the storehouse. I must not be suspected. So, I'll stay with Vasudevan and delay the special team for as long as possible. Once the job is done, I'll come there directly. Okay? My team is going in tonight, Sans. Your package will be ready by tomorrow morning. I'll be there on time. The sound chip you requested is in this device, Arjun. Sans Ferraro will reach the spot at 6 AM on the dot. When Vasudevan and I go to the temple at dawn, the treasure won't be there. By then, you will have finished the job. After that... ...it's my job to finish you. Excuse me? I meant finishing our deal. Okay. Don't worry, partner. I'll leave only after wrapping it up clean. He's trying to fool everyone. Until the goods reach the spot... ...you need to watch him. For his betrayal... ...I will end him myself. The temple map. As always, the temple will close at 6 PM. The public and temple staff will leave by the east exit. To avoid people, we need to go by the western hills. Along the wall there, are stones that function as steps. It'll be easy for us to climb up and down. That wall is 17 feet tall. The rope is vital, DK. Okay. The temple stands on 62 acres of land. This is the sanctum sanctorum. The lidar scanner revealed a basement structure underneath. So, the treasure must be in there. We need to look for the Strategic Wheel in the other halls. High decibel frequency will start coming in from the west side, at midnight. With noise cancelling devices, we can block it out. How? Exactly at midnight, this will turn on. It'll emit negative sound signals to cancel any other sound signal. If no signal is detected, the device will automatically turn off in a minute. An important thing. No one bring their cell phones. The radiation emitted by the phone will produce adverse effects. The map is your responsibility, Madan. -Sure. Photos of the manuscripts and inscriptions stay with me. At 6 AM, the revenue department will enter the temple. No matter what happens, we need to exit the temple before 5:30 AM. Pack your necessary gear. -Okay. (A Sanskrit hymn is chanted) Don't forget to drink this herbal water. Because the Nayakkar family always drink it before they enter the temple. What's up, Mr. Devaraj? Are all the documents ready? Not yet, sir. I'll get to it. "You'll get to it"? I told you to give it priority! We don't know where that secret room is. As if I know where it is. But Krishnappa Nayakkar knows, right? But how will he tell us, sir? With a government order in hand, he has no choice but to tell us! There's a festival tomorrow, sir. -I know. The entire town will be there. -Let them be. Pressing this now will lead to trouble, sir. Aren't you an officer with this department? Sir? -You are taking his side! Random people come up and tell me about secret rooms. What were you all doing for three months? Without finding all this? The minister comes making bloody deals with me! Look at this face. Does it say 'thief' on it? No, right? So, we're meeting Krishnappa Nayakkar today! Mr. Nayakkar is quite an influential person in this town. We're a lot more influential than him! Who are we? We're the government! The revenue department is coming tomorrow, with police protection. They'll handle any problem. You needn't worry. What if that information is fake, sir? Is there a link between you and that minister? Nothing like that... -Then do your job! What's the plan? The photos Arjun captured of inscriptions in the inner sanctum. It means that like one needs to get past the 'Nandi' (bull) to see Lord Shiva... ...we need to get past the 'Garuda' (eagle) to see Lord Krishna. So, we start at the Garuda shrine. Shall we begin? "Swirls all around a plash, wherein golden fish splash..." "...to end, tired in play. Thither, they sway..." "...from the cardinal four on moonlit nights, from yore." "A dip in the pool to savour the cool..." "...and then, lute strings from the pillared hall rings..." "...standing under the rise of a mythical eagle's war cries." "At the flower-strewn Maayon's feet, the Gandharvas sing, bring cheer and retreat." This is Telugu, right? Do you speak it? It means the Gandharvas come to the pond. They go to the Garuda shrine. They play music in the hall. Right? This sounds like a temple myth. Doesn't seem like a clue. Is anything else written there? Give me the torch. It says the clue is in the Garuda shrine. Here's my doubt: What if this is just one part of the clue? True! -Alright. We'll each search one direction. You take the east, Anjana. Madan, take north. -Okay. DK, go south. -Okay. Dear son... Brother Arumugam! How are you? -I'm fine. How come you're here all alone? DK is not here? That's why I asked. They've gone out for some research. Be back in the morning. "They've gone out?" The soul of this town is this temple! You must use your power to protect it! If you don't... ...I may be forced to use the power that was bestowed upon my family! Mr. Nayakkar? Like a lizard that sacrifices its tail to save its head... ...deciding what's important and what's not important... ...based on circumstances, is true intelligence. That is real wisdom too! Who are you? These are my questions! What are you doing here? You must not be here. It's time for them to arrive! Who? Leave! I thought it was the snake! "Snake"? -Yeah! There's a dwarf in there! "A dwarf"? -Yes! The snake! Run! Where are you going? A snake! A snake, man! What snake? There's a banshee! A snake, man! Come on, DK! The dwarf! We've dealt with a damn snake! Like he's any challenge! Don't do it, DK! What kind of game is this? That dwarf is doing it! It's not funny anymore. I didn't hit you! -Then who did? Don't believe me, right? Hold on! Oh no... -Hey! Why do I alone get hit, despite you throwing? He's gone! Look... the snake! DK! Hold on! Stay in place! There is beauty in your fear. Don't be afraid. Come near me! Come... Come closer! What happened, DK? My torchlight is missing. Have you seen it? "Torchlight"? Dunce! -Arjun! What is it? Arjun? Arjun! Arjun! What happened, Anjana? Strange things are happening here! I can't stay here for another minute! Let's leave! If everyone leaves, who'll get the treasure? With all that's going on, you still talk treasure? I'm leaving! I'm leaving too! There's nothing like that in here! Trust me! You said there was nothing here! How do you explain this noise? Quit yelling! The sonic device cancelled the noise. Many things happening here are beyond science! We're leaving! Anjana! Please listen to me, guys! There's someone running there! Recognize him? Nayakkar's son! He's coming back! You've had it! Now do you get it? It was all a show put on by Nayakkar to protect the treasure! I have doubts about the temple myth. Why? -Here's the thing. I've heard Gandhari cursed Krishna after the battle of Mahabharatha. I mean, I've read it. But Krishna is beyond joy and sorrow. Why would someone like him come here in sorrow? Why must the Gandharvas cheer him up with music? Wait! So you're saying this is just a fairy tale? The kings could've fabricated the story of this temple, right? "He split his army into three groups, and attacked from several directions!" We must appear near when actually far... ...and afar when actually near. We're looking for clues in the temple. But the temple itself is a clue! -I don't get it. Repeat the verse, Anjana. "Swirls all around a plash, wherein golden fish splash..." "...to end, tired in play. Thither, they sway..." "...from the cardinal four on moonlit nights, from yore." "A dip in the pool to savour the cool..." "...and then, lute strings from the pillared hall rings..." "...standing under the rise of a mythical eagle's war cries." "At the flower-strewn Maayon's feet, the Gandharvas sing, bring cheer and retreat!" Notice a pattern in the story? This is the clue to the Strategic Wheel! They didn't hide it in one place. It's been split and hidden all over! How'd you figure that? How does the story go? The Gandharvas come to the pond. They go to the Garuda shrine and pay their respects. Then, they play music in the hall. Take out the Gandharvas' activities and just think of the places they've been. The pond. The Garuda shrine. The music hall. So the keys must be in these three places. So... shall we begin? Super! Are you not coming, man? Don't be scared. I'm here for you! These don't fit! Give me that. There must be a center piece to connect all three. Get the map! We got clues for the Strategic Wheel... ...at the Garuda shrine, the pond and the music hall. It's a perfect triangle. So the center piece must be in the centre! "Cardinal four..." -What is it, Arjun? "From the cardinal four..." That's direction. Are they talking directions? East, North, South, West. The Moon Hall! Yes! The center piece must be in there! Got a matchbox, DK? Are you going to smoke? -I'm going to set you on fire, idiot! Hurry up! The camphor's about to go out! All gone! Everything is lost! Everyone will be here soon. All our efforts have been in vain! All is lost! We dreamed so much! A villa in Switzerland! What did you wish for? My mother abandoned me as soon as I was born. It was Devaraj who educated me and brought me into this field. Even if it was for his own benefit, he was the only one who helped me. This job is all he asked of me. I am doing it because he asked. Besides that, I have no desires. Kasi! -Yes, sir? Get our guys and go to the storehouse. Sans Ferraro will come. Stay with him. -Yes, sir. Arjun must not be spared. Got it? -Yes, sir! The Gandharvas are in the Moon Hall. What's the connect between the Gandharvas and the moon? Strategic Wheel... Wheel... "Be it a round wheel or a spherical moon, they all have the same value: 3.14." The moon! Maybe this light is the answer? Maayon. Maayon means Krishna. Feet. The flower. The flower is the center piece, guys! Try pressing it and pulling it. Yes! The conch. The fish. The snake. Here is the Strategic Wheel! Since the era of Arjuna Rayar, this festival has taken place. Only one pot contains butter. No can do! -Don't talk too much, sir! Will you open the door and let us in? Or must we break it open? Who do you think you are? Think you'll leave here alive after defying our leader? Leave, everyone! -Hack him up! Listen to me. You can't move a brick in there as long as I'm here! Then there's just one way, sir. You open the door yourself and co-operate with us... ...and safeguard the sanctity. There is no other option. Like a lizard that sacrifices its tail to save its head... ...deciding what's important and what's not important... ...based on circumstances, is true intelligence. Alright. If I open that door... ...I don't know what the consequences will be. You need to bear responsibility. No matter what happens, we'll handle it. Four locks here! You mentioned only one! I drew it per her instructions. That's what the palm script said. We have no time for that. Just insert it into any of them. It's risky to do that. If inserted in the wrong hollow, poisonous gas will be released. Knowing merely what metal a weapon is made of... ...can tell us the period and dynasty it belongs to. Four metals. Gold. Silver. Bronze. Iron. What do these four metals signify? The four directions or the four Vedas? Or four eras? What does the temple have to do with eras of time? This is a temple of Lord Krishna. Krishna was born in the Dwapara era. That's the third. So it must be the bronze. Give me the Strategic Wheel. Greetings! Greetings! O Krishna... Hurry up! It's time! What gives, Devaraj? Didn't your team take these? Missed it, eh? What's happening? What is this? This is a neem stick. For brushing teeth! Where's the flute? -Take it! Sans Ferraro! If we trap him, we can apprehend his entire network. We need an expert in this field. I will take the responsibility. I'm going to assign this task to the best student I have ever trained. Mr. Arjun Manimaran! Warfare is based on deception. Deceit and betrayal. These form the basis of war. Sans Ferraro has asked for a very ancient statue. He buys only ancient statues or anything related to it. Depending on circumstances, we must be ready to adapt. I've confirmed that a 5,000 year old flute is hidden in the Krishna temple. Make arrangements to sell the flute separately. If anyone gets in the way, I'll handle it. Understood. The play has begun! Good. Let's get prepared. Devaraj! What you were trying to sell, are not temple idols. It is the identity of our nation! Selling out your motherland's identity is the same as selling off your mother! Will you sell her? Take him away and give him quite the treatment! Attack, when unprepared. Get our guys and go to the storehouse. -Okay, sir! Attack the enemy when they least expect it. "Hundreds of idols smuggled from India have been recovered." "The government has engaged to retrieve thousands more smuggled idols." "Sans Ferraro, an Italian, who smuggled antiques and statues on a global scale..." "...has been arrested by the Tamil Nadu Police." "Breaking News!" "Minister Selvadurai has suddenly tendered his resignation." "It is believed his decision is due to health reasons." Good job, Arjun. Your actions have made not just this department... ...but this entire nation proud! -Thank you! "The task force that was launched four years ago..." "...to look into the mysterious deaths in the department of archaeology..." "...has brought to light, the truth." This was given to me as a show of respect. I'm hungry! -I'll give it to you when we leave. What happened last night? Did they all go insane? Not insanity, sir. It's a kind of hallucination. "Hallucination"? A mental state that makes one see things that are not there. It was a group hallucination. A person's word is believed as truth by all. To snap them out of fear, the solution I created is... ...Nayakkar's son. I made them believe the mysterious events were staged by the Nayakkar family. After that, they believed whatever I said. Wood appeared as gold to them and vice versa. Drop that stuff! Why take that? Are all the mystical claims of this temple real? Does that music make people hallucinate? I used a special device to cancel that sound. Not just that. When running a scentography test... ...I learnt the hallucinations were caused by a flower called 'Somavalli'. These flowers only bloom at night and the scent fills the temple. Those who smell it, begin to hallucinate. How come the smell didn't affect you? All thanks to the antidote herb. -"A herb"? I saw the herb at Krishanappa Nayakkar's house. One night, I followed Nayakkar's son to find out where it grows. Some herbs fell from a bag he was carrying. I had it sent to the lab for tests. I found out that consuming it can prevent one from hallucinating. So all of this was to safeguard that treasure, right? That's what I thought, too. There is the symbol of infinity, on the room's wall. I think that points to another mystery. This is where we must compliment the intellect of the ancient Tamils! What happened to Anjana and the rest of them? Devaraj and Madan will be in prison for life. DK and Anjana have turned approvers. The jewellery and antiques found in the temple, are being evaluated. What will they do with the treasure? It is traditional wealth, dear boy. It belongs to God! This tradition... God... Isn't it all for the sake of people? Must it not reach them? You're right. It must reach the people. And it will. The temple's sanctity is lost! Neither is the sanctity lost nor have your responsibilities changed. The secrets of the temple, my family has safeguarded for generations... ...and the music of the Gandharvas, are merely tales? Without Lord Krishna's blessing, nothing can be moved from this temple. What was the reigning star last night? -The Rohini. When moon reigns in this star, the Gandharvas don't play music. Exactly at midnight, this will turn on. If no sound signal is detected, the device will automatically turn off in a minute. So you're saying we need not change the temple's customs? This is not the end. It is the beginning. At the right time, this will show you the way. Nara Narayana! Thank you, Arjun. Shall we go? -Just a minute. At least from now, can you be fully truthful with me? Ask me what you want to know. Is Krishna's flute really in that temple? It was all a sham to lure Sans Ferraro out here. Good God! You could've told me that! Who else would I tell, if not to my life partner? I have plenty of stories to tell you. Quite a tall tale!
