Kaoru's grandfather. Kaoru's father. The village counsellor. Hello, counsellor! I'm late, I'm late! Counsellor. My son's fiancée is coming. Counsellor! I'm late, I'm late! My son is getting married! Kaoru's brother. We've had another baby. A boy or a girl? A boy. His name? We call him Taroko. Your seal. I want to give him up for adoption. I have too many mouths to feed. I want you to keep him, Mitsuo. Mitsuo won't need your baby. His future wife will give him children. Won't you at least see Taroko? Have mercy. I'm going to have to leave him under the bridge. YAMADA VILLAGE COUNCIL. Yours was sold. I've won 300 yen. He buys something for dinner. Kaoru at school. "A New Sister" by Kaoru Sakamoto. Kaoru got a 10! Dear sister, I am waiting to see you. What a pleasure to have you with us. Please be my sister, before being my brother's bride." Kaoru's essay ends up there. My dream sister... The counsellor's son is getting married! Congratulations! Grandpa Sakamoto! Congratulations! I hear you now. How about a game? Hello, sister! It's your sister-in-law. What a lovely young lady! I'm not a young lady, I am Kaoru. I embroidered this especially for you. What a beautiful collar. It has our family's flower. Kaoru, I have something for you too. What a pretty doll! Thank you, sister. Would you be my sister, please? Oh! How adorable! I would love to have a sweet sister like you! I'm so happy. There are so many things I want to show you. A tennis trophy. Photo albums. Do you like cream puffs, sister? We have persimmons this big! You are adorable! The groom is waiting. Stupid. Invest in rice, What's wrong? Apologize. Apologize. What's wrong, Kaoru? Are you going to forgive me for my bad behaviour? Will you keep on playing with me? How could I refuse my sweet sister? Happiness... To keep the maiden on Earth. What's wrong, Kaoru? My brother's bad. He's taken what's mine. Dear child. You are my sister, right? Then don't go back to my brother. I want to be with you forever. But... I can't... If your son has a girl, let my great-grandson marry her. Yes, sir. It's a deal. I think I'm winning. SHOEMON SAKAMOTO RESTS HERE. Oh no! The dog, Taroko, was run over by a train! REST IN PEACE, TAROKO. We had an extra. Another bank run. The farmers are too busy to read the newspaper. TOILET Extra. Towa Bank is bankrupt! Bankrupt! TOWN COUNCIL Cheer up, Mitsuo! I'm sorry, father. The counsellor was good to us villagers. I wouldn't dare go to his auction. The house is locked up. It's a sad sight for us villagers. This is a bad place. It's a pity we can't help the counsellor. Farmers across the whole country are poor now. 50 sen. 1 yen! 1 yen, 50 sen. 1 yen 80. All for 10 sen! I'll let you have this for 80 sen! 85 sen! Can you ask him to sell me the doll? Sister, thank you! DRESSMAKER. Son. Cheer up! Don't let it get the better of you. I'm sorry, father. I'll have a drink with you tonight. If we had gone bankrupt, it would have destroyed Grandpa. Even if our shares hadn't collapsed, medium-sized farms like ours are really struggling.. Is Kaoru going to drop out of school? She will be graduating soon. We'll manage somehow. Don't worry, Miyoko won't leave you. Father is in a good mood. He must be pondering expansionism. May I speak to you, father? I'm going to drop out of school. Miyoko is too sick to work. I can't have her work to pay for my tuition. So I'll get a job. I'm going to work at the post office. A girl shouldn't worry about finances! Kids must play and study hard. Get a diploma and a good job. That will make your sister happy. Today you have a tennis match. If you don't win, I won't let you into the house! Cheer up now! I'm going, sister! I know you're going to win today. Is that good? It seems to me that you work too much. Children mustn't worry about such things. Attention! Handkerchief? Paper tissues? Homework? Turn around! Go! I'm going to win. Miyoko works hard so that Kaoru can stay in school. Too bad her parents sent you a sick girl. Her parents think she can work, if that's what she wants. But they are also worried about their only daughter. They ask if you would agree to send her to a sanatorium. I hope you can understand their wish and let her go for a while. I wish we could take care of her. We didn't sell Miyoko's belongings. We can send them to her parents. We may never meet again... And Kaoru? She's going to boarding school. Poor thing, all alone... Well done, Kaoru! I won! Where's my sister? Where is she? Dear Kaoru, I am going home. I will be back. Miyoko. Alone! KAORU SAKAMOTO, DORMITORY 18. Is my sister so sick that she can't write to me? I don't think I'll write to Kaoru. Because I don't know if I'm going to get better. Oh, the cobwebs. ANNUAL CHARITY BAZAAR. What are you selling? Price: 30 sen. Mine comes to 40 sen. 60 sen. How much for the Pheasant's-eye flowers? 100 yen. What? This is our family's flower. So it's very valuable, it's priceless. Don't bother. It may be valuable, but no one is going to pay that much. Pheasant's-eye, 100 yen. Imagine if it sold! It would be more money than all our sales put together. FOR SALE Maybe the five of us could buy everything and be done with it. Yes, come on. It's all very cheap. Oh, a Pheasant's-eye! Perfect for my living room. 100 yen. 100! I guess some of the girls are playing a joke. I want to buy your flowers. How much are you really asking? Alright, Madam... It will be a pleasure to contribute to the cause. Well then, how much is it? The price is on the label. Mrs. Sakamoto is from the nobility. Why don't you give it to her for free? The honour of my family is at stake. I would like to buy those flowers. Those lovely little flowers! How could I forget them? Sister! How I missed you, sister! My little sister... SANATORIUM. Oh, sister. My little sister. I hope you'll get better. Keep this, as a memento. Kaoru, let me see your face. Read this with your brother when you get to Manchuria. All that I feel for you is in this diary. The perfume of the flowers will remind you of the good times we spent together. The scent of Pheasant's-eye END
