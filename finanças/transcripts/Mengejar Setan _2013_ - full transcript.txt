As far as I know it ... ...there's no problem with the house. I've sold the house ... ...because I need some money for my business. Okay then, Excuse me. Fine. I saw this woman in this painting at the stairs. I feel a very strong energy in this room. And it comes from the painting. What do you mean? This painting has a dark past. I'll find out what is it about. A little kid's voice. It's my daughter, Alia. Have you been to have an accident? How do you know? I'm just given a little gift from the Almighty. Can we see other rooms? Please. Mr. Andika? You don't look very well, Sir. I cannot concentrate. I'm gonna leave first, okay? Don't forget, there will be a fax from Semarang about a design. Please study it. Okay. I'll surely call you about it. I've never been to experience that strange thing all my life. The negative energy in this house is big enough. Have you ever told ... ...what you've experienced all this time to Mr. Andika? Why don't you want to tell him? I don't want to add more burden on his mind. He really cares about me. And I don't want to disturb his concentration on his work. Well ... I understand. I will try to help. I'll come again here tomorrow. I'll have to talk with Mr. Andika. I'll tell my husband. Thank you, Mr. Broto. Just got home, honey? You look so tired. I've just checked the new office. It seems promising. By the way ... ...whom were you talking to? That's Mr. Broto. Friend of Angie's. Mr. Broto? Who is he? What is he doing here? I asked him to come here. To check out the house. Angie said he's a psychic. A psychic? What the hell is this about? I don't believe in such things. He's a stranger, isn't he? What if he's a criminal? A conman? And something happens to this house? Who'll be responsible? But, honey, he's Angie's relative. And what happened last night was ... ... really not natural! I went upstairs today. At first the door can't be opened. Suddenly the door opened by itself. I saw ... ...the 'kebaya' woman in that painting ... Enough. How many times I told you? You're too tired! You need to rest! But honey ... Enough, I don't want to argue! Honey! Abort it? No! I don't want to abort the fetus! My God, why are you like this? Remember! We're legally married although it's just 'siri' marriage! That's not the problem. You must abort your fetus! I don't want to! This is my child! Jamilah? Jamilah! Wake up, Jamilah! My God! Honey. Honey! Honey? My God! Honey! Hello? This is Mr. Broto. Mr. Broto? I'm a friend of Mrs. Tari's. How can you know my number?

Tomorrow night ... ...I will come. You must tell me everything. Hello? Hello, Sir? What? My cellphone. Gone? MORTUARY Here, Sir, sign here. Honey! Open it, honey! Honey! Open it! Honey! My God! That will be all, Ma'am. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I can't stand being terrorized all the time like this, honey. We have to get out of the house. I miss Alia. Don't think about it, okay?
