It's the Californian, Frank Capua, car number 25, with more than one lap to go seems to have this race in the bag. About 150... He's in trouble. He seems to be out of gas. Heads for the pits. What a tough break for Capua who has run this race... Hey, Frank, get worried. You're going to blow $12,000 out there. Go. - Go? You mean out there? - Come on, move! Turns as they go out on the bridge! It's Capua by the narrowest of margins turning right behind number 83 with less than four miles of racing to go in this Redburne 200, a $50,000 automobile race with 12,000 to win! And Erding makes a bid for that 12,000 on the inside. Now again on the outside! You kept looking at my hat. I just wanted to say I'm not a fireman. Well, you look like a fireman. It's the hat. I'm the guy who won the race today. Well, I knew you didn't look like any fireman I knew. I also won $12,000. And a fireman's hat? The fireman's hat was a gift. And I always wanted one of these. Beautiful. - Elora? - Yes. Started out as Ellen Sue until I was 14. No, I'm not married. - It looks like a wedding ring. - It started out to be one too. I'm free and easy. Say, listen, why don't I rent a car? Because you're drunk. Listen, if I wasn't drunk I wouldn't want to rent a car. Well... So... Because I are drunk and you ain't, why don't I...? Why don't I rent it and you drive it? I think you should. I don't think you should every day, but considering the circumstances, I don't think it would be wrong if you said yes today. What's the matter? Just exactly what circumstances did you have in mind? 'Cause I won the race. Thank you. Come on. You know, I've got a son who's five-foot-six and a half inches tall. - How long were you married? - Three years. Summer vacation this lake is full of kids from morning until night. In heat waves the whole town comes out here to breathe. This where you always come? With men? I understood you. - Where are you from? - Santa Monica, California. - Is that a big place? - Yeah, it's big enough. It touches Los Angeles. Well, Redburne's a little place. People in Redburne talk just to have something to do. And I live in a house with my mother and my son. So when they talk about me, it reflects on them. I just wanted you to know I'm not easy. OK. I came out here because I like you, and I just wanted the chance to tell you. Ma? Good morning. I'm sorry I had to wake you up, but I didn't want you to worry about me. Yes, I am. Ma, will you stop scolding me, please. I'm not ten years old. I don't know. Listen, let's just don't argue about it. It doesn't get us any place. Ma... Ma, listen. Charley has a dentist appointment on Thursday. Would you make sure he gets there, please? No, no, no. I'll talk to him later. Mother, I am not leaving Avis in the lurch. I was just putting off my vacation until Mildred got back. Yes, I will... No, I... I will be in touch, I promise. I love you too. And don't forget about the dentist appointment... Thinks I'm five years old. Well, I'm all yours. At least for the time being. Let's go visit an ocean. - Atlantic or Pacific? - Pacific. California, here we come. - What is that? What? - It's a sand crab. Now, that's a free way to live, isn't it? I wish Charley could see that. He'd go out of his mind. - Where'd you go? - What? Sometimes I'm talking to you and you just disappear. I have a feeling I'm talking to nobody. Floyd used to do that. He was the boy I was married to. - Come on. - What? I want to show you something. - Well, what? - I grew up in that house. - Really? - I had this bicycle. They wouldn't let me ride in the street until I was eight, just to the corner. Well, driving in the street is dangerous. - Where are we? - Oh, help. No, no. We are averaging 52.68 miles an hour, and we are exactly 35 and a half miles from checkpoint A. Thataway. No? Oh, dear. Well, back to the old drawing board. What am I suppose to give him? Oh, the... Yeah. You fellas are in the wrong place. This lady says you'd be 35 miles back thataway. Sorry. Oh, wait! You forgot the... I love you. Charley, I am not responsible to you for my comings and goings. I will be home tonight. Well, of course I miss you. Would you please hug your grandmother for me and I'll see you both tonight. You see? Here's why you walk it. You hit one of these on a curve and... They weren't here last year. Why don't you bring him here, instead of going home? What I'm trying to say is that, if I marry you, I think he ought to be here for the wedding. I've been thinking about it. Hey, Frank. - Is that your lady? - That's her. Lou Erding. Congratulations. Beautiful. How are you? - I brought you my oldest and my best. - Your only. My oldest and my best and my only. - How are you? - Pleased to meet you. OK. You'll have a lovely weekend, be nice to each other. And... I'll be out at the beach in case you need a referee. OK, I'll have him back on Monday. Goodbye, darling. I lied about your age. I told them you were 18. Eighteen? He's OK. - That your car? - That's it. It's welded. You gotta get into it like this. Go ahead. - It's OK? - Yeah. All right. What do I call you? I guess you call me Frank. Charley. Charley. The pass has been made by Frank Capua, number 56, for a narrow command, having passed up number 92, the last leader, Jimmy McElreath. Tremendous contention as they come around... - You all right? - I'm OK, I'm OK. Roll me back over. Open the gas tank. Get it clear. Get some air in there! - Come on, Frank. Let's get out of here - Get your hands off me! Does it bother you for me to be here? No, it's all right. Why don't you go to sleep? When I was about nine, or maybe ten, for a couple of years I was scared of the dark, you know? My grandmother used to get mad 'cause I slept with the light on all night. So I finally got a flash light and turned it on under the covers. What were you scared of? I never really knew. It went away, finally. Just like the car lights. They come in and go across the ceiling and down the wall... ...then they disappear. Where's your father? Do you ever see him or hear from him? No, he just took off when I was a kid. When your mother and me get married, I want to adopt you legally. It'll be a whole family, and you won't be left out belonging to somebody else. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Congratulations, Mr and Mrs Capua. - Capua. - Oh, no! That's fine. I think you look great. - Honey, honey! - Thank you very much. Congratulations! I want to kiss the bride! - How are you? - Congratulations. All yours. Check me out? Sport, you gotta learn to drive this thing by the seat of your pants. Charley is as happy as a kid with a new dune buggy. Yeah. That was very generous of you, Frank. You are a very generous man. Thank you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I think this is the nicest one of my honeymoons. Oh, I don't know. On a honeymoon, the bride ought to get out of the kitchen. Yes, but we'd have to take Charley's dentist with us. What about what's-his-name, did he get you out? - Who, Floyd? - Yeah. Floyd took me to Milwaukee on our honeymoon for a week. We spent the week touring breweries because they give you free samples and Floyd thought I might acquire a taste for beer. A hell of a rich taste to acquire on a honeymoon. I never even acquired a taste for Floyd. Oh, dear. Poor Floyd. You know, if the worst problem in your whole life is that you're alone in a bed in a house, and you look around for somebody to solve that problem, that somebody might just turn out to be somebody named Floyd. The name doesn't really matter. Beer's a lot less complicated. Yeah. But it could've been anybody named anything. Well, at least I finally acquired a taste for beer. - You gotta pack? - Yeah. You know the honeymoon is over when the old man has to go back to work, right? What will it be like on the circuit? I'll work on the cars and I'll drive, then I'll eat and sleep, and then I'll work on the cars and I'll drive. And I'll think about you. I'll go to bed and I'll think about you. Sometimes I think it's better not to know what you're missing. You are so lucky. You sit there all closed in by machinery and bolts... ...precise things. There's hardly any room for you. It must be a nice, safe feeling. Well, you gotta learn to trust something. It just as well be the seat of your pants. Lou Erding, in car 17, the East Tennessee Ford, still out in front with Frank Capua, number 47, in the Worsley Ford, right on his tail. Bet you thought I was out on a date. No, I thought you were asleep. I was going to hang up not to wake you. And you would too. I know you. I would've wrung your neck. Hello? Are you there? - Anybody home? - Yeah, I'm here. - What are you doing? - When, now? Yeah, now. Just sitting in my room. - And? - Just sitting. - I can't think of anything to say. - Well, maybe I can help you. I'm just sitting here too. I'm... well, I don't have a dress on, and I don't have a nightgown on. As a matter of fact, I don't have anything on. I'm just sitting here stark naked as the day I was born. Does that open any interesting lines of conversation? Well... Hey, are you really naked? - I just had a bad day. - Well, now we both had one. I just wanted to tell you everything's OK. I worry less when you don't call than when you do call and vanish on the telephone. Are you... ...really naked? I thought you'd never ask. I want you here, but it doesn't make any sense. I'm working on that damn car 18 hours a day. I've got my stop-watch. I could hang it around my neck and figure out the wrong time. I could use it. I lost today. I was about a second behind everything. Crawford's running two cars at Indy. Erding's driving number two. - When are you going to be in Indianapolis? - May first. - That's when I'll be there. - That'll be nice. I'm going to see if I can 't get some sleep. OK? Good night. Good night. Big, huh? Somewhere in there there's a big garage. Well, Elora will be getting up about now. Probably in the kitchen, fixing the kid's breakfast. - The married life. - You were married. A couple of months, once. The beginning of the second week I started thinking, "Man, you have been here before." - You had been. - Never for a whole week. Waking up next to somebody you recognise can get to be too much a good thing. I mean, the Miss Redburnes, Miss Manifold, Miss Lap-Money, they've got something special because they've got different faces. Elora must have something very special to make up for that. She's a very special lady. - I'm out of line? - You're out of line. It figures. I said it. It's out of line. Sorry. Here you are, gentlemen. I give you your automobiles. Well, it sure beats the hell out of my garage. - Running Girlings this year? - Yeah, going to give 'em a try. Boys, I'll give you the cars. All I want from you is to come in first. Both of us? Three in a row. You won me again. Somebody else better win you once. I got a bad back. I teach him a game, and he beats me at it. You win her four times you'll be up for a major medical. - Bartender, go. - Not for me. I gotta go to work. Double or nothing? I don't believe my ears. Did you say you had to go to work? Yeah, I gotta go down to the garage. You didn't make any plans, did you? No, I just thought we might do some strange, exotic thing like going out to dinner together. - Want to try your hand in this? - No, I gotta go. Why not take the rest of the day off? - You make the rest of us look bad. - How? He wins. - Always? - Always. Think about the odds, baby. They're beautiful Are you kidding? I'd scrape you right off the sheet. - Put the cigarette where your mouth is? - Yeah. Go. - We gotta play for something. - Well, I'll think of something. You going to sleep inside the car tonight, Frank, or underneath it? He's part bat. He's been known to hang upside down from the cylinder block. With his head tucked underneath his arm. Two bits, that's the stake. In place of me? He just wants to win. He doesn't care what the stakes are. - She's got a fix on you, Frank. - That's why I married her. Well, it must be nice to wake up next to somebody you recognise. Yeah, it is nice. Look at him. Isn't he beautiful? Tachometers for eyes. OK, Lou, get off the pot. You're a winner. What else? Sorry. Looks like you're going to have that strange, exotic dinner with us. I don't think so. I don't think I'd be very good company. I think I'll go to a movie. The dirtiest one I can find. A movie alone? A beautiful woman like you? - Impossible. - Want to bet? Oh, Frank. Would you leave some money tomorrow so I could pay the motel bill? Is it a week already? Oh, boy, oh, boy. Hey. - Can I have Sunday? - Depends on the car. Frank, even God took a rest on Sunday. I'm not God. That's my problem. I sent your suit to the cleaners, the dark one. You'll have it back on Tuesday, OK? You know what I thought would be nice? To drive out to the country on Sunday and have a picnic. We'll see. Are you going to sleep? I am asleep. - How you doing? - Good. Get everything all right? Wait. Where are you going? - I'm going to give you a hand. - Go back to the motel. You've been working too hard. Go talk to your wife. Yeah, Frank, you stay here. You work. - I'll go home and talk to your wife. - All right, all right. You... Frank, come back tomorrow morning. Get some rest, baby. You gotta qualify. - What's he doing? - He's just sitting in the car. Frank Capua is the fifth man to attempt to qualify on this first day of the time trials at Indianapolis, Indiana. Why the hell isn't he running? It's his concentration, Leo. The car sounds good. 164.379. A rather disappointing, slow trial his first day out here. The fastest qualifier on this, the first day, will start with the coveted number one position on race day. He's flagged off by Leo Crawford and the pit crew. The man does not indicate the chequered flag. ft is not an official attempt. Now it's your turn, Lou. Now leaving the starting line, Lou Erding in Leo Crawford's other racing machine as Frank Capua limps in toward Gasoline Alley. They'll go back and look things over and determine if there's something wrong with the car... He's moving back into the pit area. The car?! be moved to Gasoline Alley. They're going to look it over, and perhaps they'll bring it out later today. Lou Erding on the tack. The pit watches... He's on it! The green flag is out. Erding out after the pole position. Here it is! First lap, 170.378 miles an hour. It's the fastest... that's been turned in today! Erding turning in a terrific speed, lap number two! Just one-tenth of a second... ...170.281 miles an hour. Two more laps to go in the battle for the pole position! Erding's now coming for the white flag. Here it is, a new track record! Lou Erding, 171.657 miles an hour! - Look out! Bad racing luck! - Erding has blown his engine! Smoke pouring from the back of the racing machine. Lou Erding on his way to the fastest qualifying speed, good chance to pole... I'll get myself sorted out by this afternoon. I'm going to put Lou in your car, Frank. - It's your car. - Yeah, it's my car. It's my money, my factory, my reputation, it's my car. What is the matter? I gave you a better car than last year, more horsepower, a better handling car and you take it around four seconds slower. - Put him in it. - I want a crack at the pole, Frank. He can blow two engines in one day. Ought to be some record. That's the way I see it. Now, if you want to put Lou's car back together, you've got the crew. - He's got my wife, why not my car? - I didn't give him your wife, Frank. - Yeah? - Frank. Who is this? Larry? I didn't recognise your voice. - What time is it? - About a quarter to 11. - I fell asleep in the chair. - Frank, your boy's down here. - Down where? - At your garage. - He's with his grandmother. - He's looking for you. Wait a minute. Frank? - What are you doing in Indianapolis? - I want to talk to you. - How did you get here? - I hitch-hiked. - Did you let your grandmother know? - I left her a note. Did you call your mother? No, sir. - Stay there. - Yes, sir. Hello? Charley's here. Where? He's with my mother. - No, he hitch-hiked. - From Redburne? He's fine. I haven't seen him yet but he sounds fine. - What does he want? - I'm going to go talk to him now. Listen, a couple of things. He can't stay with me. I just thought I'd put him in a cab later and send him over. The other thing is your mother must be out of her mind by now. He just left her a note, so she's probably too scared to call you. Yeah. I'll call her right now. - Never know what a kid'll do, do you? - No, I guess not. Are you still there? Yeah, I'm here. I hear you told Leo where to put his car. Something like that. - Can you get another ride? - I might. What can I say. Take care of yourself. I really ought to break your neck, you know? She said there wasn't any fight. You didn't have a fight or anything. She said it was just one of those things. Things happen. - What do people get married for, then? - That's a good question. Nobody can explain everything, Charley. You were married. You don't have to let her walk out on you like that. What do you do? What would you do? Man, if it was my wife, I'd kill her. Just her? Not him? Why not both of them? He's nothing to me. Well, a thing like that is... People stay married 'cause they want to, Charley. Not because the doors are locked. Where's the cab? Maybe it picked up another fare on the way. No, if they take the call, they come. Who gets custody of me? Well, I guess you just stay in Redburne. - Well, Elora wants me to live with her. - We'll see. Maybe I'll split it and not live with either of you. You've got a couple of years before you take off on your own, sport Yeah. But you're not going to kick me around like a piece of furniture. I got something to say about it. Don't you think we'll talk about what you want? I want to stay with you. - We'll see, Charley. - "We'll see"! I don't live anywhere. I stay in motels. I went to court to get you, buddy. That's just paper. She had you. I didn't bring you up, I just came along afterwards. - I'll give you some money. - I've got money. OK. Hoosier Motor Inn. Take care. I'll make some kind of decision. I thought you already did that when you adopted me. You know I'm going to stay for the race. I want to see you beat him. - Hey, Leo, I want to talk to you. - What do you want to talk about? - You want to drive the car? - Yeah. I told you before, it's there waiting for you. OK. Tell Larry the way you want it. Just make it so it fits my can. Mother. What? What is it? What's the matter? What time is it? About a quarter to five. I'm going out to the track. Wait a minute. I'll go with you. I'm going to see Frank. I wish I had some coffee. Charley, just stop right there, OK? I want to talk to you. What for? What are you going to accomplish? You know the way I feel. Yeah, I know the way you feel. But you don't know the way I feel. And I'm not going to explain it to you, either. You don't know about girls past taking them to the movies. You'd be surprised what I know about girls, Mother. Well, I might be surprised, but I'm not interested. What I am interested in, Charley, is your attitude towards me. I think you did a stinking thing. I didn't do it on purpose to hurt Frank. Explain it to Frank. Frank doesn't treat me like a tramp, and you do. Maybe he's too nice to you. lam your mother, Charley. You give me some respect. Look, people earn respect, they don't get it. I'm quoting you. Charley, I didn't do you any harm. You think if you and Frank break up nothing happens to me? I can't live two lives. I can't live yours and mine too. Charley. Be my friend, please? It's a different Frank Capua out there today. Much faster than on the first day of qualifications. And here's the speed now for Frank Capua's second lap. 166.189 miles per hour. It seems that Capua has really regained his touch. 167.921 miles an hour! It's one of the fastest speeds that's been turned in at! day. The short chute... ...onto the fourth turn and going for the chequered flag. And there's the chequered flag for the finished qualification lap for Capua. Fourth lap speed, Frank Capua, 169.182 miles an hour. It's the fastest lap of the day. That puts him 17th. Here comes owner Leo Crawford, a happy man with two cars qualifying. Lou Erding in fifth position and his partner Frank Capua in 17th. Congratulations on a great ride. You're in the field with a speed of 166.392. You're in the sixth row, middle spot, seventeenth slot. How do you feel? I guess I should've gone quicker. Should've gone quicker. Congratulations, Frank Capua. Frank! Frank, look this way. Come on, give me a smile. Leo Crawford. Mr Crawford! How are things going? Pretty well, huh? I am doing very well. I've got two in this race. Frank here and Lou. Frank! You're OK. Hey, Ray, will you let the kid in? You really don't have any room for your feet. Put your foot over to push the clutch and everything gets tangled up. It must get pretty hairy. Put your foot off the brake, will you? - What are you doing? - Looking for something. Boy, you're pretty compulsive. I'm in the race but I got 16 guys in front of me, buddy. - Aren't you hungry? - You trying to tell me something? I'm hungry. Leo trusts everybody. Padlock the hair on his head if he had any hair on his head. You want something? I read that in Germany they got a lot of black eyes from popping champagne corks like that. - Yeah? Why Germany? - I don't know. Yeah, life is getting too dangerous to live in it. Salud. What's that for? When you celebrate, I celebrate too. - Come on, you don't drink. - What kind of a put-down is that? I gotta start sometime. I'm 16. - You wouldn't even like it. - How do you know unless you try? Take a sip. Salud. - Good. - Oh, my God. Hey! - I'm going to get drafted in two years. - You'll drink then. - I won't know how. - You'll know how. Well, what do you want me to do, drink with strangers? Salud. If you get sick, don't say I didn't warn you. - Salud. - Salud. - So how's your love life? - I like 'em. All of 'em? At first I didn't like any of them. Then I started liking just one. And then I started liking all of them. You get going with just one girl at my age, - and it gets serious. - Yeah. When I get married I'm going to keep my wife under my thumb. You say that because you're only 102. Wait till you're 154, like me. - Are you 154 years old, Frank? - Yeah, today. Happy birthday. How do you feel? - Good. - Great. Not great. Good. Frank, you know what? How about a little sugar in his gas tank? That'll fix him. I read that in a magazine about how the saboteurs work. Do you think I'm drunk? I don't need any sugar in the gas tank. I'll beat that son of a bitch anyway. I don't feel so good. That's the price, swinger. You know what you're going to do. No. What am I going to do? You go up the stairs. You do not drop your clothes, you fold them. You jump into a pair of pyjamas and you glide, very stylishly, into bed. Right now. - He's drunk. - He's with me. Good night, Mother. Good night, Father. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, reporting from Gasoline Alley here at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The Weather Bureau reports the skies will be clear and the day beautiful for the running of the 500. There has been frenzied activity all day long here at Gasoline Alley as chief mechanics and drivers have given the final OK to their beautiful racing machine. Good morning, from the greatest course. It's race day. From Indianapolis, Indiana, the crossroads of America, this is Sid Collins, the voice of the 500-mile race... [whistles blowing} Here. I brought you this. I don't know how to use it.

It's a tense moment now at the starting line. You take care of yourself out there, all right? The excitement and tenseness mounting as the hour of the start approaches. Here is the president of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Mr Tony Hulman, with those famous words... Gentlemen, start your engines! The leading white pace car moves into the number one turn. The 33 cars begin to unleash their power. This is the parade lap. The pace lap will follow. Six, seven... it's the most beautiful sight in racing. Everybody up and wave them on their way! The pace car pulls off, the green flag is out, and the race is on! I don't see him. The race is stopped. The red flag! The red flag is out. The race is stopped. What the hell happened? That's him! Did you touch anything, Frank? Hey. I looked all over for you. I'm OK. All drivers, please report to your cars at the starting line. Please report to your cars at the starting line. All cars remaining in competition will start single-file behind the pace car. There will be no parade lap, ladies and gentlemen. No parade lap. A single-file start behind the pace car. Gentlemen, restart your engines! He's OK. Coming on to the straight away. The pace car pulls off. And the green flag is out. And the race is on! Johnny Rutherford, the leader, in car number 18. Les Bottineau, car number 25, challenges for the lead on the number four turn. Takes over! He's number one! Car number 25 on the second lap. Bruce Walkup is third...

McCluskey is fourth. Frank Capua in car number three has just passed Jim McElreath for tenth. Capua now tenth and moving up in the field. Capua started 17th today, has already picked up seven positions and is a definite contender. And Capua goes into ninth place. Here are the official standings. Les Bottineau in car number 25... The drivers now starting to make their first pit stops of the day. Three are required. Frank Capua coming in for his first pit stop. His team-mate Lou Erding, really moving and closing in on number 18, Johnny Rutherford. Erding in second position, and he's moving extremely fast! Erding is now in second, and he's closing the gap on leader Les Bottineau. Looks like there will be a battle right now for the lead between Bottineau and Erding. It's an accident on the back stretch! Trouble coming out of turn number two. Two cars involved! Two cars involved! The yellow fight is on. The starter waves the yellow flag. Here's the report. The accident involves Al Unser in car number 24 and Carl Williams in car number 84. Cars are pouring into the pits. The leaders have now pitted. Car 25, Bottineau, and car 42, Luther Erding, are both making pit stops at the very same time. Second place now is in the pits. Whoever comes out first should be in first place. And Bottineau is out first. He's in first position. Capua signals for a pit stop. Still under the yellow light, Capua taking advantage of this opportunity for his second pit stop. Lou Erding in the number two position begins his challenge of the leader in car number 25. Bottineau still leading. Lou Erding again and again taking chances. He's manoeuvring all over the tack, lapping the slower cars. Pursuing the leader, going into the back stretch. Lou Erding after the leader! He's almost up to him. Alongside! Moving at the end of the back stretch, he's got him! Lou Erding is moving away from Les Bottineau in car number 25. He's lapping car after car, trying to run away with this event. Erding's so far in front ii looks like the thrill now will be the race for second spot. Bottineau's still running second, but Capua's moving up in the field. Capua now fifth. Lou Erding running away from Bottineau, trying to put this race away. He's lapping the slower cars. He's a half a lap ahead of second place Bottineau. Erding moving like a breeze out in front, holding steadily. His team-mate, Frank Capua, is on Bottineau's tail fighting for second. There's trouble on the back stretch! It's... It's the leader Lou Erding! Smoke pouring out of his car! He moves to the infield. He's out of this race! It looked like he had this race won, but his car wouldn't take the beating. I told him to breathe that car. It's a duel between Bottineau in first and Capua in second! Get him! Move it! Go! - Going down to the last lap. - Come on! Moving to the inside. And Capua's. .. got him! Capua gets the chequered flag! I won! I won! I won! And he's still pouring it on. Frank Capua's driving that extra insurance lap as if the race is still going on. Frank Capua drove a classic race out there today, ladies and gentlemen. He nursed that car. Held back in the pack. Other drivers took the chances. And then, on the last lap, he moved ahead to win and won the race in one of the strongest finishes we've seen in years. Charley? Here. ...our 500 winner! At the top of the driving heap now! The crew now moving in around the car, attempting to assist Frank out of the cockpit. There's Leo. He's pulling the helmet off. Frank is out of the cockpit now. ...unopened Coke and an opened bottle of milk. Drinking milk. An assist from Leo. Now the Coke is back. It's been opened. We're trying to move in a little closer now. Following Queen Mimi Littlejohn of the 500 festival now coming up. There's the traditional kiss. The kiss in victory lane has been accomplished. Another part of the record established. Congratulations. How did it feel when you saw that chequered flag? Well, it felt pretty good. A lot of people say when you win the 500, it changes a man's life. - Think that's true? - I haven't got the slightest idea. - How do you win from so far back? - I took a few chances, I guess. No, but the car was just first class. - Leo, that's quite a driver. - Best driver and car in Indianapolis. Crawford Industries built that car... How about that insurance lap? How about that? Didn't you know the race was over? I didn't feel like stopping. It'll only take a second. That's more like it. You're a big hero to my kids, Frank. Hey! Here he is! The winner! My brother-in-law, Sid. His wife Hazel. That's Norma, my wife, the one I was telling you about. Congratulations. - Listen, I'm just going to... - Yeah, thanks a lot, Frank. Hey, buddy, you ran a great race. I was pulling all the way for you. Now you can buy into that real estate development we got near Hoover Dam. - It's a retirement community. - Write me about it. Our aluminium's better than that stuff you're using. Next time you get... - Hello. - Hi. You really got lucky today, Frank baby. Frank, you were just great. You were great. The way you handled those yellow lights... Hey, Unser, did you see this squirrel when he tagged me today? He looks pretty good for an old squirrel. - Congratulations. Looked great. - Thanks, Bobby. Oh, let me see it. Let me see it. Oh, it sure is big. You did it, Frank. You did it. You did it, Frank. - Yeah, I did it. - Yeah, sitting in my car. Where was Lou when he was sitting in your car? You gave him that car? Well, Lou, he hasn't got it. - He doesn't have it. You got it. - Yeah, I got it. Frank, Frank. What are you going to do about a new contract? - With you? - With me, baby! Yeah, with me! Leo, I'm going to come and get your back teeth. You son of a bitch, you can have my back teeth! - Well, listen. - To what? What? Let me tell you something. That's the way it is with us winners. Congratulations, Frank! Come on, I'm on the phone. Hey, Charley! You bet I won, buddy. Come on, I'm on the phone! What? I can't hear you! Hey! Buddy, hey! I can't hear you! Come on! Frank? They won't let me talk to him. Well, you'll just have to stand in line and wait your turn, Charley. Congratulations, again. Yes? Got a cigarette? You going to Milwaukee? Everybody goes to Milwaukee after Indianapolis. I'm sorry. It wouldn't have happened if I hadn't let it happen. You've got a nice kid. I hope you get everything you want, Elora. You too. - Good job, Frank. - Thank you. Nice going, Frank. You really got pushing them. Thank you. How are you, swinger? Good morning. Beautiful, Franklin. You're beautiful. - So how did it go last night? - So-so. - I was looking for you. - Yeah. Well, I saw you. You gotta have a lot of sore hair this morning. I came to tell you that you really did a good job. You set it up nice. Frank, can you talk a little louder, please. - What? - Could you talk...? No, I mean it was nice. Well... ...we probably could've used a wilder cam. - What do you think? - I don't know. Try it in Milwaukee. Well, listen, Frank. You... We all made some money yesterday. You know what I mean, Frank? Oh, jeez. There's gotta be something more than that. 'Morning, Mr Capua. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Oh, by the way, Mr Erding's waiting for you right over there. Frank. You drove a good race. I'd like to get this thing straightened out. We're going to be running into each other and I... I want to get it out of the way. It was wrong. I know that doesn't mean much, but... It was wrong. I pushed. It's... the same way I drive. It's my hang-up. I break things. I don't mean to. Look, I'm not in the picture any more now, so, um... I don't know how you feel about her. I'm out of it. You win. These people are gone. You're supposed to be in Milwaukee, aren't you? Did you come and see Charley? I came to see you. I got the... ...divorce papers from the lawyer. Well, I didn't think I had any right to ask for anything, so I just... ls everything OK? Yeah. - I mean your life. - Oh, that. Yeah, that. I think we could make it now. I'm no good at it, Frank. This the way you see your life laid out? The safest place I can find. That's the way you want to play it, safe? What difference does it make how I want it? I wanted you. When I was getting undressed to get in bed with Lou, I wanted you, but I got in bed with him. You shouldn't have let that happen. I've been married twice. It didn't work out. I don't think you were ever married. I don't think either of us were. - Let's just don't rake it up again... - Hey! I'm trying. I'm trying to reach past the steering wheel. Don't back away from me. I don't need your second chance. Well, maybe I do. I'm driving good but my life is crap. Hell, I drive good. Work on the cars and I'll drive and eat and sleep and work on the cars. But my life is crap. Well, I'm responsible for that. No, you're not. I am. You're to blame, but I'm responsible. Or put it another way. I'm to blame, you're responsible. What the hell difference does it make? I mean, I want you. I don't think I'm as brave as you are. Well, you're going to be. Otherwise... Otherwise, we just went through the whole painful mess for nothing. Now, if you think we can make it, we can make it. -- English --
