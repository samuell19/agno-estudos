(SIREN WAILING) DISPATCH ON RADIO: MPD tech ops to Metropolis City Hall. 207AW in progress. Kidnapping with advanced weapons. Gotta be Intergang. They took out half the reserve with their tech weapons last week. Makes you nostalgic for assault rifles. (POLICE RADIO CHATTER) (SIREN WAILING) (GUNS COCK) (OFFICERS SCREAM) (OFFICERS PANTING) (OFFICER YELPS) (SIREN WAILING) It's a left at Shuster Plaza, Maggie! These assholes are expecting something direct, Dan. Probably with a cape. Lucky me, I know a back way. Get Mr. Mayor and his better half out of here before we get trouble from the man upstairs. Didn't know you was a believer, boss. That ain't the man upstairs I'm talking about. (TIRES SCREECHING) (GROANS) Step away from the Mayor, Mannheim. Don't give me a reason! Then you shouldn't have given me one! (BOTH SCREAM) You. Make sure they're dead. Painfully sure. And you, grab our esteemed Mayor while I call for a ride. It's okay, I'll get you out of here. (GRUNTS) (GROANS) (TURPIN CHOKING) (MECH 1 LAUGHING) Come on, fella, you don't wanna be a cop killer. Yeah, why's that? Huh? SUPERMAN: Hey. Ever wonder what it feels like to fall from a great distance? Let's find out. (MECH 1 YELPING) (GROANS) SUPERMAN: Oh! Looks like it hurts. Be right back. (MECH 2 YELPING) Work, damn it! Stupid piece of crap! You're supposed to transport me on my command! (GRUNTS) SUPERMAN: Don't bother. I fried it with my heat vision. Only place you're being transported to, Mannheim, has got three squares a day and lights out at 8:00. You son of a... SUPERMAN: You know, if there's one thing I can't stand, it's a bully. (MANNHEIM YELPING) (GROANING) SUPERMAN: Guys like you give Metropolis a bad name. (GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) (GROANS) But you should know by now, Mannheim. No one tears my city apart and gets away with it. MAYOR: I feel like I say this a couple of times a week. Thanks, Superman. I don't know what we'd do without you. You sound like a guy who wants my vote, Mr. Mayor. BIBBO: Hey, hey, that's my friend, here. (LAUGHS) Superman! Hey, it's me! Your old buddy. Bibbo Bibbowski. How is the unluckiest sailor in town? Ah, come on, you ain't had to save my bacon that many times. Anyway, ain't no sailor no more. I'm a restaurateur. Ace of Clubs Bar and Grill. How about a picture for the joint? (GROANS) Stupid thing. Never works when you need it to. I got you covered. BIBBO: Jimmy Olsen! You're a lifesaver! JIMMY: Say "Superman." Superman. (CAMERA CLICKS) (LAUGHS) Thanks, big guy. I'll make sure to get this to you, Mr. Bibbowski. See you down at the joint, kid. The ribs are on me! Thanks, Jimmy. I really have to get going. Leaguers, is anyone... available? 'Sup? I have to be somewhere. Think you could help with the cleanup? Oh, again? I swear, you guys think I'm some sort of one-man janitorial crew. Well, while you're at it, my apartment could use a going over. Whoa. What the hell have you been up against? An Intergang crew that somehow got a hold of a Mother Box. (COMPUTER BEEPS) CYBORG: And that's not all... This armor's from Apokolips, too. How do you figure? I'm wearing the same stuff, remember? Oh, great. Leftovers from our war with Darkseid. We need to get this analyzed. Maybe one of the others could help. No. We need someone who's worked with this crap. Someone who knows it inside and out. We need my dad. I can take it to him, if you want. I know you two don't exactly... No, it's cool. No problem ever got better by avoiding it. Well, at least I won't be slowing you down on clean up! Later, partner! I owe you one, Flash! You owe me about 30! I wonder if it's too late to join the Titans. Is there an age limit? LOIS: (SIGHS) He's going to take pictures with anyone who asks. The guy just can't help himself. (AIR WHOOSHES) You said two minutes, tops. Sorry, Ms. Lane. Tech-enhanced gangsters kidnapping the Mayor and other assorted distractions. I know. I saw it live. Are you sure you're not just getting old? You'll have to tell me what that's like. Ha! Super touche. SUPERMAN: Your stories about Superman helped me earn the peoples' trust. Now, it's time they learned about the Kryptonian tech that brought this "strange visitor from another planet" to Earth. And here's the compartment that contained me as an infant. Throughout the trip it was in charge of monitoring my genetic makeup as well as my basic metabolism. Not to mention midnight feedings. How did it do all this? I've only gotten so far studying Kryptonian technology. That's why I handed the job over to Dr. Klyburn and her crew. Which we were more than happy to take on. Only recently have we discovered these super-condensed ionized crystals. We believe they acted as hyper wave acceleration units for transport. Oh. The gas. To put it simply, we pulled it from the main section of the pod. The baby's car seat, so to speak. It can only be activated one way. You might want to look away for a moment, Ms. Lane. Kryptonian tech can be a bit overwhelming. Holy... Your identity genome is confirmed, Kal-El. I am the physical embodiment of a personally-attuned program, designed as a repository for all that is Kryptonian in nature. My sole purpose on this journey is to inform you, assist you, and protect you and all Kryptonian life. During your... Wait a sec, is he... Yes, Ms. Lane. You're looking at the last son of Krypton's nanny. Keep watching. As I have also been entrusted with preserving the history of all Kryptonian bloodlines, we will begin with yours. The House of El... LOIS: Wait, is that... There's your headline, Ms. Lane. I'd like you and the rest of the world to meet my parents. So, what do you think? I don't know what to say, it's... Hey, Superman. Looking good! It's going to be a reminder of just how alien you are. People forget that when you're saving them from falling airplanes. True, but I have faith that... (CAR HORN HONKS) MAN: Hey, you rock, Superman! (MUSIC BLARING) Thanks. You do, too. There's a really smart woman I know who always says, "Daylight is the best disinfectant." Lift back to the Planet? And save me from expensing cab fare to Perry White? You are heroic. You know me. Always saving the day. Uh, thanks for the ride. Gotta go. WOMAN: (GIGGLES) There he is. MAN: Hey, Superman, can I get... Me too. MAN: Oh, man. (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) Oh! You're in a rush. LOIS: Got a big story. I don't want to spoil your day, but you're looking at the guy with an exclusive on Intergang. That's nice. Come with me. (CHUCKLES) What's bigger than Intergang? You'll find out. Oh, right, you had that interview with your super friend. I know what that means... (SIGHS) In here. (CLARK MOANS) You're always on fire after seeing him. Should I be jealous? I think it's the tights. I can pick up a pair if that's all it takes. Perfect. Wear them on our trip to the Hamptons this weekend. Uh, about that... Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Do you know how hard it is for me to get away? I gave up that interview with the secretary of state. I can explain... Really? You mean it's not some secret meeting with some secret spies in some secret location? My parents are in town. Serious? So, you buried the lede. This weekend just got a whole lot more interesting. Um... I don't... You don't what? Want me to meet them? Don't you think it's time? Lois, wait, it's just that... Look, Clark. I'm not gonna waste time worrying if a guy likes me or not. We're both adults. I know it was my idea to keep things secret at work, but I'm really trying here. No, no, you're right. You should meet them. It's just that this is uncharted territory for me, and there are some things I need to get used to sharing. Clark, it's your parents. What am I gonna find out? That you were a huge dork? I already know that. It'll be fine. Just fine. SUPERMAN: Well, Dr. Stone, what's the verdict? It matches what we've seen from other Apokoliptian tech, but not completely. John, can you come here for a moment? I can't remember the last time you asked for help. Dr. Irons is one of S.T.A. R. Labs' premier engineers. If it's about this metal, Silas, I've been... Oh. Yeah. It's him. Have we met? At a construction site, once. I had just quit LexCorp and wanted to get my mind off it. I remember. Nice shirt. I wear it with pride. Uh, can we just do this already? What did you find, John? It's definitely from Apokolips, but it's been bonded with Earth-based tri-formulides at an atomic level. The combination makes this stronger. Incredible. That means it's even stronger than you, Victor. Always got an encouraging word, huh, Dad? You'd need some very sophisticated resources to produce an alloy like this. S.T.A. R. Labs could do it, but it sure didn't come from here. Maybe WayneTech or even... Of course... Cyborg, we'll catch up later. Thank you both for your time and expertise. You're welcome, Superman. I appreciate you bringing me in on this, son. It's been a long time. Yeah, I know. Sorry about that. Doc Irons, you good? Better than ever, Victor. Lose something, Lex? (LEX YAWNS) I'm sorry. What are we blaming me for now, Superman? Those weapons this morning. They're based on alien technology but clearly modified for Intergang here on Earth. Ooh, that sounds scary, but as you can see, I spend my days under house arrest, wearing this crude leash. I've added a little dash of Kryptonite green. Don't worry, it's not real. Oh, come on. Intergang has connections all over the planet. It could be anyone. We'll get to the bottom of it, Lex, and when we do, I'll be back. You know something I don't know? Only that this city's never going to love you just for hating me. (GRUNTS) Senator, the rents on those slums were raised 200%. As the newly disclosed owner, you must have some kind of a comment. (LINE DISCONNECTS) I guess not. CAT: Incoming. I heard something juicy and I had to share. Doesn't Daily Planet Live go on the air in two minutes? Mmm-mmm. I'm not on until the second segment. I'm sure it could wait. (LOIS TYPING) So you're meeting the parents. Oh, God. Make it stop. Lois. You're great. I respect you. I wanted to be you until I found out on-camera pays more than digging through government garbage. Who told you, anyway? You did. Just now. I had a suspicion something was up when you stopped calling him Smallville. I did? (SCOFFS) Sweetie, the women here notice everything about tall, handsome men. And the only competition in this place is Steve Lombard, and he makes me feel like I need a shower. Hello, ladies. Did someone mention the Steveinator? Yes. I think it was Human Resources. You see my point. Hey! Listen, Cat. Clark and I are just good friends right now. You want to spread it around the office? Have at it. Just let me get back to work, okay? Okay, okay. Just be careful. You always said Clark seemed different, like he's got a wall around him. It's like he doesn't want anyone to get too close, you know what I mean? Yeah. I guess I do. MAN: We need you on set, Ms. Grant. (ELECTRONIC BEEP) That's my cue! See you! TERRI: Drop something? As your long-suffering, devoted wife, I'm used to your butter fingers at home, but... Hank, you're setting a bad example for the others. Yeah, Commander, I'm starting to wonder if we've got the wrong Henshaw in charge. Guys, I'm happy to let Terri call the shots, but I gotta warn you, I'm considered the nice Henshaw. (LAUGHS) Yeah, right. Terri, give Houston a call. Looks like they were right about the hydraulic struts. The launch vibration probably knocked some screws loose. Knocked some screws loose. Very technical. Well, I'm sure you can science that up a bit, Madam Engineer. Houston, this is Excalibur. Come in, Houston. Come on, Space Rangers, last looks before we head back in. It's your ninth trip up here, boss. You can't still be dazzled. I'm just looking for a red cape. You can see it if he's above the exosphere. He's been up here twice, you know. Saved my ass, one time. Yes, sir, you can always count on Superman. (STAMMERS) I hated to interrupt your plans. How was your night on the town, Mr. Luthor? Phenomenal, Gregory. But then again, every private performance by the Bolshoi is a little better when it's forbidden. Do you have something for me? Uh... Right. Sometimes I forget which one of us the government has placed under house arrest. I don't. Hank, they need you back online. Important. Henshaw here. What's up? Oh, hell. We've got unidentified debris heading our way! Everyone back to the ship, now! Leave it! LEX: Always happy to walk among the greatest minds of this generation. That's why I bought them. That specimen's clearly porphyritic rock. Read a book, you clod. At last someone understands Euclid's fifth postulate. Too bad it's not you. I do not suffer fools, people. The world is filled with too many already. Obsequious cretins who worship aliens, believing them to be the agents of justice. But I have seen the alien's true face. I understand his threat. In spite of my false conviction at the hands of these vigilantes, LexCorp has stayed on mission, redoubling its efforts to find the next alien Ubermensch and crush it in its infancy. Now. Show me what you've found. Okay. They hacked into Houston's encrypted feed from the Excalibur shuttle, and something's heading our way. HANK: We've got 30 seconds. You need to fire engines now! I'd like to see what they're running away from. Do we have a satellite nearby? (GREGORY TYPING) Enlarge. Does that asteroid look unusual to you? It looks lumpy. Hmm. I was going to say pregnant. (ALARMS RINGING) Tethers still attached. Bay doors open 12 degrees. I don't care! Initiate primary thrusters now! (BOTH GRUNT) ASTRONAUT: Captain, impact! We're breaking up! We've lost starboard thrusters and altitude control! Oh, my God, Hank, we're not going to make it! Like hell, we're not. Superman will save us. Just like always. (BOTH GRUNT) ASTRONAUT: We're breaking up! Stay calm, everyone! He's on his way, I know it! ASTRONAUT: Losing thrusters, we're out of control... Hank! What are you... It's okay, Terri. You can always count on Superman! (ASTRONAUTS SCREAMING) (TERRI SCREAMING) Terri, no! (BREATHING HEAVILY) Superman? I knew you'd come! TECHNICIAN ON PHONE: Mr. Luthor, I have to hurry before I'm missed. The meteorite's impact was in the mid-Atlantic channel. Coordinates 40. 712 north, 74. 595 west. Did you get that? LEX: Your son's anti-toxin will be delivered within the hour. Congratulations on his survival. Time to go for a swim. (BOTH GRUNTING) Clark! Flank me! Seriously, Diana. We need to use code names in the field. You just called me Diana. But that's what you want to be called. (GROWLS) (BOTH GRUNTING) You want to be called Superman? Sounds like even your ego's super strong. I just don't need my real name public. Besides... I like Superman. (GROWLS) Because Wonder Man sounds like we're married? No. Because she gave it to me. You mean Lois? Yeah. Lois. Funny how you use her actual name. But don't allow her to know yours. It's a complicated relationship. Kind of like ours was. It was nice for a while. Yes, it was. It's just as well. I wasn't very good at playing this masquerade of yours. Towel? I don't sweat. Maybe not on the outside. CYBORG ON PA: Guys, Lantern finally made it. We're all in the meeting room. HAZELWOOD: Descending now past 9, 000 meters. 9, 500 meters. I hear something off the port side... Whoa! LEX: I'm paying you for your experience, Hazelwood. Be skittish on your own time. HAZELWOOD: We're already at 10, 000 meters, Mr. Luthor. Dive deeper. I want to find that meteorite. Uh, Mr. Luthor? There's someone out there. LEX: Those are Atlanteans, you idiot. Aquaman's tribe. MERCY: Hold on, Lex. I'm picking up something. (CREATURE BREATHING HEAVILY) (CONTINUES BREATHING HEAVILY) I suppose you want us to find out where that's coming from. LEX: You suppose correctly. HAZELWOOD: They've stopped. (RUSTLING) (BOTH SCREAM) HAZELWOOD: Somethingjust grabbed them! I can't get a visual. (ATLANTEANS SCREAMING) It sounds like they're being torn apart! Mr. Luthor? Are you still there? We've got to get out of here. We've got to... (SCREAMS) What the hell... (SCREAMS) (ALARMS BLARING) (CREATURE ROARS) (WOMAN YELPING) (CREW WHIMPERING) (BANGING) He's gone. Go back. I want to see that thing again. Amazing. A creature who's traveled light years through space and survived a catastrophic entry to Earth. The blue boy scout could have some competition. Okay, next up. The operating budget for the upcoming fiscal year. Utilities are above what the UN cleared for funding, guys. I'll handle it. Move on, Cyborg. Wonder Woman merchandise did very well this year. I can step up when the Wayne Foundation falls short. You're kidding, right? Okay, okay. Let's just agree we have this covered. What else? Just the Excalibur incident. Only three bodies recovered. I've got my guards investigating the impact area. S.T.A. R. Labs wanted some rock samples. All right, well, if that's it, we'll meet next Thursday, same bat time, same bat channel. I won't be here. Why? Yeah, if I can be here, you can be here. Dude, it takes you all of three seconds to get here and back. Two at most, but point taken. I have a meeting with the headmaster at Damian's boarding school. No way! Batman has a parent-teacher conference? That's great. Are you in the PTA, too? Tell me you're in the PTA. (CLEARS THROAT) I'm Batman. We need more chaperones for homecoming. Who has to be convinced to sign up? (LAUGHS) Heh. (CLEARS THROAT) I'm just joking. I think that's great. Is he still glaring at me? Mmm. We could just push the meeting back to that evening? Ah, can't. I've got rehearsal dinner that night. Is he in a play? He's getting married, somehow. Yep. Married the next day. Limos, banquet hall, DJ, the whole shebang. Just immediate family, you understand. Does Iris know? She better, she picked the date. No, I mean, does she know about you? Are you kidding? I told her ages ago. Jeez, Supes, you can't drop a bomb like that on the honeymoon. Aren't you worried? About what? About bringing her into your world. The dangers, the sacrifice... Clark, that's what marriage is all about. GREEN LANTERN: This calls for a toast. We've got some beer in the fridge. I know, milk for you. CYBORG: Congratulations! Where are you going? Fiji? Bora Bora? SeaWorld? GREEN LANTERN: Okay, Flash, there are times when speed is not good. PA KENT: So next thing I know, he's climbed on top of that bull! It couldn't throw off my little Clark, though! The kid was a daredevil! This Clark? The guy who irons his socks? Dad. Come on. TMI. What's that mean? Too much information, Jonathan. I'm sure Lois has heard half these stories before. Not really. Not at all. That's because if my folks have taught me one thing, it's not to talk about myself. (LAUGHS) That's a parent's job. Mission accomplished. Sounds like there's a lot I don't know. Warn me now if I should keep my distance. Well, you wouldn't be the first young lady to break his heart. TMI, Ma. Oh, now we're getting to the good stuff! (CHUCKLES) Well, first there was Lana, lovely girl. Lived next door. She'd come over every once in a while. Not like Pete Ross. I mean, he was there every day. Always wondered about that boy. Then there was the girl on the swim team. Laurel? Laura? Um... Lori. Lori Lemaris. I remember her. She was quite a catch. (LAUGHS) Pa. Clark's right. Maybe we shouldn't talk about her. I am serving halibut. (CLARK GROANS) Come on... Taxi! Here it comes. And there it goes. You okay? You couldn't wait to get me out of there, could you? Well, that's not true. I didn't want you to be bored by all those stories. Bored? Clark this is the first time I think I've ever learned anything about you. To be honest, it drove home how much distance you keep between us. Lois, you know me better than anyone. Then that's a real shame. Nothing is more important to me than you. I just have trouble showing it. There's something else going on, and sometimes, I feel like it scares you that I might get to the truth. Taxi! On second thought, I think I'm gonna walk. I think I'm at the spot where the killer emerged. I don't see any sign of him. I need to get back to the others. I've got the coordinates. I'll let everyone know. Sorry for your loss, man. (SNORING) I'm sorry. I guess we talked too much tonight, didn't we? You were fine, Ma. We're getting old. The secrets... They don't seem as important as they used to. They served a purpose. Still do. She's a nice girl, Clark. You deserve someone special. The problem is the more special they are, the more you want to protect them. I know, but you should have choices like anyone else. We raised you so that you could be yourself. We didn't raise you to be alone, honey. I've never been alone. Not since the day you and Pa took me in. (GROWLING) (BREATHING SHAKILY) (BEAR SNIFFING) (WOMAN GASPS) (BEAR HOWLING) (SCREAMS) (GASPS) Brian? (GASPS) (WOMAN SCREAMS) LOIS: Cat, please, at least let me have my coffee first. Abracadabra. Here. Caffeine. Ingest and go. There's nothing to say. That's never true. Isn't there a Wayne or a Kardashian you could be chasing? You. Kent. The Kansas crew. Was he all nervous and shaky like he gets? I gotta start taking the stairs. Well, you know, he got here early. Clark? Yep, and he keeps finding reasons to walk by your desk. Cat, seriously, can you lay off? Things didn't go quite as expected. Having you press buttons is really not helping anything. (YELPS) Lois. I stopped and got you some... coffee. Should I leave? No. Cat, I was just looking for a background on a Congressman Lois interviewed last year. (SOFTLY) Maybe we can meet for lunch? We need to talk. Okay. I can eat around 2:00 p.m. (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) That'd be great, whatever works for you works for me. There's a place in Hobbs Bay. Get the address from Jimmy, and I'll meet you there. Wow. So what do you think? It's hard to say. He's nervous, that's for sure. It could be nothing. You know how men are. You never know. Mmm. Yeah, you're in trouble. I'm sorry. Don't order a lot for lunch. You don't wanna be bloated when... Mmm. I got the alert, what's up? Just wanted you to know there's action in your zone. Where? I think we're okay for now. Flash and a few others are already headed out. Initial reports are some kind of creature. Arthur spotted something off-shore, might be related. I've got a lunch with Lois, but I'll cancel. We're good with who we have. This lunch wouldn't have anything to do with what we were discussing the other day? Call if the League needs me. Is that your way of saying, "Mind your own business"? Yep. (SIRENS WAILING) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (OFFICERS SCREAM) It killed him. It killed him! Oh, my God, please, if anyone's watching this, send help! This monster's killing everyone! (GASPS) No! (YELPING) GREEN LANTERN: It's okay, kid. We're here now. Flash. Civilians. (HAWKMAN GROANING) (GROWLS) (GROANS) Hawk's still alive. CYBORG ON RADIO: Lantern, we need a perimeter. Like hell. This is no time for a rope-a-dope. I'm a member of the Green Lantern Corps. We eat monsters like this for breakfast. (SIREN WAILING) (ROARS) (GRUNTING) (GROWLS) (ROARS) (GROANING) Okay, didn't see that coming. (GRUNTING) (GREEN LANTERN YELPS) (GROWLS) (GROANS) (FLASH YELLS) (FLASH GROANING) (GROWLS) Alert! Three Leaguers down and we only just got here. Need backup, now! LEX: Dabney Donovan! How's my hard-earned money being spent? Lex! Why, it's all in front of you. Every penny. I'll stay here. I don't do crazy very well. Still carrying the gun? Oh, yes. You never know when one of my babies might break out. They get confused. Any progress? Hit or miss. I expect to have more obedient samples soon, very soon. I don't want samples, I want an army! It's difficult replicating DNA, we need a more durable code. Now, that creature you told me about... We're tracking it down, Dabney. Don't count your chickens. What about this one? This was to be the prototype. It's still growing. Lex! We found it. (BATMAN GROANS) Fall, you bastard. (GROWLS) BIBBO: And then I says to Superman, I says, "Hit him with an upper-cut. Now counter-punch, counter-punch." And that's pretty much how I helped him save the city, more or less. That's quite a story. I got a hundred of 'em. I'll bet you do. How about menus? Do you have any of those? Oh, yeah. Here you go. Try the ribs. Comes with super sauce and a side of super slaw. Um, super. I'm sorry. Jimmy loves this place. Jimmy Olsen eats chili dogs for breakfast. So, what did you want to talk about? Okay. The other day, you said it felt like I was holding back, like something was wrong. You were right. Okay, glad to know I'm not crazy. Well, this doesn't have to be a bad breakup. I'm still going to come to work each day. If that's a problem, it's on you to deal with. I... Wait, let me finish. There's a reason why I'm so secretive, and I think you deserve to know why. And... I'm Superman. (LAUGHING) That's good, Clark. You got me. Look at me. Oh, my God. This is insane! But it makes total sense. You... You always showed up around the same time. It was like you were just there. And you were good. Too good. Oh, my God! This is so unethical. You wrote stories about yourself. Well, yeah, but only a couple of times. I really wanted the job. You never take vacations, you never sweat, you never tan. (INHALES) Are those people even your parents? They are, but, you know, it's complicated. Oh, my God. You're from another planet. My boyfriend's from another planet. Listen, Lois. I'm just a guy from a small town who wants to do the right thing. But doing what I do could put my family in danger. I did this so that they wouldn't have to pay for my choices. And now you want me to live with it, too? I hope you can. Because there's something else I've been keeping secret. (CELL PHONE RINGING) You wanna get that? Jimmy, I'm busy, call back... What? What? Speak up, I can't hear you. Chief wants you on the chopper! I'll be right there! Wait, why? A monster's heading towards Metropolis! He's already taken out half the Justice League. Well, I guess you must've heard... that. (HELICOPTER APPROACHING) (CYBORG GROANS) (ROARS) (AQUAMAN GRUNTING) (CREATURE GROANING) Can you tell what he's thinking? No real thoughts. It's all aggression, all about the fight. A killing machine. (ROARS) MARTIAN MANHUNTER: No! (GROANS) (SCREAMING) (GROANS) Batman! Heads up! (GRUNTS) (GROWLS) Not lookin' (EXHALES) too good, Cyborg. We can take this creep. Come on, let's... (GROANS LOUDLY) Where is that monstrosity? (SIRENS WAILING) South. Heading toward Metropolis. We need you, Clark. (PEOPLE SCREAMING) I call you out, monster! (BOTH GRUNTING) WONDER WOMAN: I compel you to surrender! (GRUNTS) (WONDER WOMAN YELLS) (EXHALES) (PANTING) You may resist the lasso, mindless creature. But, by Hera, you will fall! (YELLING) (GROANS) (WHIMPERING) (WONDER WOMAN MOANS) Diana, I should have gotten here sooner. Not your fault. (GROANS) You wait here, okay. Wait... Take him down, Clark. Don't hold back, or he'll kill everyone. (WONDER WOMAN GROANS) (ROARING) I don't know what hole you crawled out of, or where you came from, but I'm sending you back. (GROWLS) (SUPERMAN GRUNTING) (GROANS) (ROARS) (SUPERMAN GROANS) (BOTH YELP) This creature has not been identified by the government and is rumored to have left members of the Justice League wounded or near death in Carlin Heights. Hey, if you ain't got a place to go, you can stay with me while Superman cleans this clown's clock. I'll be here for you. Just like my buddy Supes is always there for us. The question is, will Superman once again meet the challenge and keep this Doomsday out of Metropolis? You heard her, people. Lois has given this thing a name. Doomsday. Let's get on it. We need a new page one. Yeah, if there's anyone left to read it. LOIS ON TV: Superman may be the only hope Metropolis has. In the past, that's always been enough. Oh, please. Cry me a river. Fascinating. What kind of civilization would produce that? It seems its only function is destruction. LEX: Perhaps it's a weapon. A first strike meant to wipe out all life on a planet for a conquering force. MERCY: That would explain why it's come to Metropolis. It's drawn to population centers. Who, besides me, would send an apex predator here, to kill the strongest thing it could find? MERCY: You think it might kill Superman? It would save me a lot of trouble. LEX: But what if the caped wonder can't bring him down? Metropolis will still need to be protected. Luckily, it's a day I've been planning for a long time. REPORTER ON RADIO: The United States Meta-human Advisory Department is recommending all civilians head to safety zones.

(ROARS) (STRAINING) JOEY'S MOM: Somebody help my child! (GRUNTS) Get back to your mom, son. Everything's going to be okay. (SUPERMAN GASPS) (GRUNTS) Oh, man, Superman's not looking good. (MA KENT WHIMPERS) (SUPERMAN GROANS) (ROARS) (BOTH SCREAMING) (ALARM BLARING) (GROANS) (GASPS) (WHIMPERING) (ALARMS STOPS) Huh? (PANTING) (GROANS) I've got you. You've got me, but who's got you? You need to call in the cavalry. I am the cavalry. (DOOMSDAY ROARS) You can't go back after that thing. It's suicide. So was following in a chopper. (ROARS) I have to get back to work. (LOIS GASPS) (SUPERMAN GROANING) LOIS: Come on, Jimmy. At this point it's impossible to tell who's the victor, though Superman has come from behind before. Huh? (YELPS) Lane. Olsen. Keep the camera rolling. You'll wanna get this. (DOOMSDAY GROANS) You think taking down the Justice League is supposed to scare us? That happens once a week! I don't know where you've come from, you alien scum, but you picked the wrong city and the wrong human. Metropolis is and always has been under the protection of Lex Luthor, you son-of-a-bitch! Now to get a piece of you. (GROANS) LEX: Step back, you freak of nature! No, stay away from me! I am Lex Luthor! I'm supposed to win! No! I'm supposed to win! (LEX WHIMPERING) No! (BOTH PANTING) No!

And I love you, too. (YELLING) (NECK CRACKING) (GROANING) (LOIS WHIMPERS) Stay with me, please, stay with me. Is that thing... Is he... Yes. You did it. You saved everyone. Good. It's all I ever wanted. Except for you. What a lucky man I was... No! No! No! No! (LOIS SOBBING) (LOIS CONTINUES SOBBING) MAYOR: Superman was an example that inspired us to reach beyond ourselves, to soar towards a better tomorrow. He was a hero to Metropolis, but more importantly, he was a friend. Really sorry, sir. Need you to step back a bit. (MA KENT SOBBING) Is she gonna be okay? Yes, Officer. It's just a big loss for everyone. Yeah. Superman was kind of like family, wasn't he? Of course, he didn't act alone. The Justice League also put their lives on the line against this brutal, incomprehensible evil. In many ways, I'm sure they feel the loss of their leader and comrade most of all. And let us not forget the quick action from Lex Luthor, who allowed Superman the time he needed to save us all. Ladies and gentlemen, Lex Luthor. Thank you, Mayor Booker. It's no secret Superman and I had our differences, but this wasn't always the case. You would be surprised at all the times he came to visit. The wisdom he would impart. I will miss those late night chats on my balcony. For Superman! Always in our hearts! BIBBO: Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed are thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners. Now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Why would you let Superman die, when a washed up old roughneck like me goes on livin'? It ain't right, God. It just ain't right. (SOBBING) LEX: I don't understand your hesitation, Dr. Klyburn. If S.T.A. R. Labs' research on the alien corpse is complete, Project Cadmus is perfectly suited to house it until it's ready for disposal. It's fine here. LexCorp just needs to get the payload rocket ready so the government can get this creature off planet before it lands in the wrong hands. You know I've been exonerated, yes? You and your S.T.A. R. bureaucrats can't keep trying me for crimes I've been cleared of. You may have been cleared, Luthor, but no one thinks you're innocent. As far as I'm concerned, Cadmus is a genetic pirate ship posing as a research... (RUMBLING) (CREAKING) Someone track it! Where's it going? Up, up and away... CAT: No one's touched a thing. I know. I just wanted to check in on him. You know, there's still a lot of people missing after the battle. They're being found every day. Clark will show up. He's got the best reason of all to return. Thanks, Cat. JIMMY: Lois! Good, you're still here. Yeah. What's goin' on? Police scanners! Come on! Jim, I'm in no mood to chase a story right now. You will be. Trust me. You drive! Is it true? WOMAN: You tell me. (GASPS) Oh, my God. Superman? (ALARM BLARING)
