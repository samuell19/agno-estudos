Obus. You know Kome is mine, my one and... So you brought me out here to talk about Kome? Common street prostitute? I know she's a prostitute, but I decide who she sleeps with. Tuvi, forget about that, please. Please. Forget about that, please. Forget about that. Okay, it won't happen again. It won't happen again. I know. What are you saying? I beat you. Rest! Don't fall. Mmm. Who is she? She's our new cleaner. Ola brought her. What happened to the old one? She needed a raise, and... Call her back. Raise her pay. We're short of beautiful girls around here. Okay. Femi told me you have a baby. Where is she? Um, it's a boy. He's at home with my friend, Ola. - She-She works here. - Are you married? No. What about your... baby papa? He-He disappeared when I... when I got... when I got pregnant. You speak good English. You can do a lot around here. Would you like to make more money? Um... Good. I'll tell you what to do. Drink. You need to take that child to the hospital. I know. I'm going. I'll see you later, okay? Please, take him to the hospital. All right? All right, goodbye. Brush your hair. Brush your hair. Yeah, huh. Ow! Okay, Peter, try and get some sleep now. But don't sleep too deep. I'll be back soon, you hear? - Mm. - All right, close your eyes. Mum? Why don't I have a daddy like Jude? Peter, your daddy... Your daddy is dead. Dead? Listen... Listen, Peter. You don't need a daddy, okay? You have me, and I will always be here for you. - Okay. - Always. - Okay. - All right? Okay, now try and sleep. Don't think about anything. Just sleep. Okay? Good boy. Close your eyes. You're good? Eugene has a big one for us. The order is for tomorrow night. He's a big businessman with a series of oil wells in the Niger delta. - So I heard. - I think you should really make him happy. He's paying dearly for this one, baby. Yeah, big bucks. Where? Um, his-his guest house. - Room 206. - Yeah. Hailing Father! - Charger! - Father! - How are you? - Father, you know I'm always good. - All right. Go have a drink on me. - Uh... - Go have a drink. - Ah! Tuvi, Father! Hailing Father! Excuse me. You claim to love me, but... but then you make me prostitute and-and traffic drugs, eh? Sometimes a man must do what he must... ...to remain a man. I can't do this anymore. Peter deserves... better. Eh? Is that a request or a threat? - Tuvi... Tuvi... - Shut your mouth! Sorry. - Now. - Jude! - Bye, Peter. - Bye, Jude. Peter, bye. Tonight, you all will be on the road to Libya. - Road? - What? But the agent said we're going by air. Quiet, everyone. You're right, but you did not let me finish. My agent is also right. But there's a little change in plans, hmm? Uh, tonight you all will be given your visas and passports to Europe. - Whoa! - Wow! Buses will be here to take you and other girls that will be joining us to Libya, where my partner is already waiting with your flight tickets across the Mediterranean Sea to Europe. - Thank you! - Yes. Uh, this morning, I personally spoke with the owner of the biggest hospital in Europe, and we have been able to secure nursing jobs for all of you. Uh, take them to their rooms. Yeah, boss. Follow me. Okay. Fools. Look, I know Zinder is shorter, but go through Dosso. It's safer. Hmm? - Yes, sir. - Good. Ah. This is a gift from my friend in Albania. Bashkim. - Wow. - Very, very smart guy. He can smuggle anything in and out of any country. Did you see the doctor? Yep. So, what did he say? - Cancer of the throat. - What? Cancer? Don't worry, I.O. I don't believe in that shit. I believe in Christ. Hey, stop it! Aah! Talking about cancer, you're still smoking. Move! Move! Move! Move! Let's go! Hey. Hey, brother, which network? What? Which network? The usual. Uh, usual. - What-What-What... - Where do you buy your recharge from? Your recharge cards... Where do you buy them from? I don't know what you're talking about! Speak English. Speak English. Brother, have I not been speaking English? I'm not going to ask you again. Where do you buy your cards from? Brother, I don't know what recharge card is. I'm not talking! I need a lawyer. Brother, see, I'm not the owner of that bag. You either want it the easy way or the hard way. I'm not talking to you. This is just a trick... See, brother, don't allow that thing to bite me. - Listening. - I'll talk! Brother, if I talk, my family, everybody dies. We will protect you. Sir, I don't trust you! Okay, okay! So... All right. The young man is not certain where the coke is. We have to be sure where Tuvi is keeping it. Until then, we cannot have a search warrant. And let's not forget who his father was. - Exactly. - Okay? Oh, come on. You need to stop smoking, for heaven's sake! You're right. It's true. It's... It's done. The last stick. Oh! You're really not listening, eh? May I please use your bathroom? Oh, feel free. Mm. - I'm sorry, but I... - Kome! How are you? What's going on here? Who are you? Inspector Dave. Call me Inspector Dave. Inspector Ogbonna. Oh, come on. What is going on here? Cut the theatricals, will you? You have shoes, we have guns. Come on, sit down. Let's talk. Okay. Give me my bag. Give me my bag. You are police. Give me my bag now. Help me. How's your son, Peter? What do you want from me? Where did you get that from? If you know my son, then you know where that is from. Kome, you seem to be a very interesting young lady. And, um... you know that can take you away for a very long time. We had information that 100... kilograms of cocaine was smuggled into the country from, uh... - Panama, was it? - Albania. - Albania. - Ah! It's usually Panama, and, um, we want to know the drop and who. How am I supposed to know that? Eh? How? You should really think before you say anything. Just imagine Peter growing up without you. I don't know. I don't know! I... I-I don't. Now, Kome, maybe you don't. If you help us get the information we need, we will help you. All right? I'm going outside for a stick. Do you know... Do you know what he will do to me and to my son if I snitch? - Do you know? - We will protect you. Please! Protect what? How? Tell me now. How? Kome, you know better than that. The choice is yours. I'm going outside for a stick. Think about this carefully. You don't want to see Peter alone, do you? Don't mention my son's name again. Don't mention my son's name again. I've made my choice. I'll take the option that gives me a few more free days to live. "I remain Wale Coker." Good choice, Kome. Good choice. Call me. Obus was your best friend. Any explanation why you killed him? Obus tried to rape Kome. I made him an example for people who lack respect for this family. Nobody respects or fears you anymore, Dad. Nobody. Even the people owing you won't pay. And you can't... or won't... do shit! Your cancer has drained our family business, Dad. And now we are broke. My son. You don't get away with anything in this life. - Life is like a street, Dad. - Eh? And the street is full of many locked gates and one open gate. You're a locked gate, Dad. And I need to find an open one. The street has two rules. One. Do whatever it takes to survive. Two. Trust no one but your instincts. As you all know, my father was laid to his final rest today. God rest his soul. And that gives rise to a new dawn of power and respect for my family name. So I want you all to go back to work and up your games. 'Cause the street speaks only one language... money. We only used chloroform to make them sleep. But they'll be dead if you don't behave. What exactly do you want? What do you want? Pay me what you owe my father. Look, look. For your information, I am the reason why your father did not rot in jail for all his atrocities in this town, and you know that. You used my father like a dog to help your party win all the elections in this state. And you think you won't pay? I do not owe your father any money. I don't. You can't do that. You can't do that. You can't do that. Please, you can't do this. You can't do this. You can't... You can't do this. No! Oh, God! You will surely pay for this. I promise you. You will surely pay for it. I didn't expect to get paid today. But I'll take all your money. Down! And you'll be too dead to notice. If you look up, I'll blow your brains out! It seems the devil wants to use you. You want to die? Put your head down! Are you crazy? Get up. Jesus. Please sir, please sir, please sir. I have no money, sir. Please. Hey. - Please, sir. - Is there any other money room? It's downstairs, sir. Please. It's downstairs, sir. Please, sir. Please. Please sir, it's downstairs. I don't have any money, sir. It's downstairs. I'm a worker. Please, sir, my father and my mother... Please! Please! Peter. What? Oh, shit. Shit, shit. Peter. I'm so sorry. I overslept. Did you brush your teeth? - I did. - Ah, ah, ah, ah. All right, good boy. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. Morning! Good morning! Peter, you're late again. - See me after the class, okay? - Yes, sir. Why are you not writing? Are you sure she's in? She is. She might have gone out, you know. Peter, maybe we should go to my place. I'll bring you back later in the evening, okay? Okay. Sorry. Sorry... - Kome. - Go inside, go inside, go inside. Wait! Kome. Leave my house! Leave... Leave my... Leave my house! Peter! Peter! Mummy, why are you crying? Is it Uncle Osas? No, no, it's not. Come here. It's all right. Do you want to talk about it? No. Hey, sit down, baby. - So, how was school? - Fine. Peter's mum was here this morning, threatening to withdraw her son if I don't fire you. Do you mind telling me what is going on? Uh, I, uh... Peter is my son. Good heaven. My step-mother was the first to notice that I was pregnant. Then she went ahead to tell my father. He told me to quickly abort the pregnancy before it becomes visible, that it will bring shame to our family name. Her father was a popular chief in Benin. He threatened to kill me if I didn't stay away. I went to Osas' house. Ola, his mother was mad at me, telling me not to kill her son. My mum had to call my uncle who lives in Kaduna to take me to live with him. Since that day, I didn't see Osas again. My own father threw me out of our house. Wow. My aunt brought me to Lagos to live with them. I came back to look for her, but she was gone. Why were you sleeping on the street the first time I met you? Ah! Ola... The first four months I stayed with them... my aunt and her husband were always fighting because of me. Babe, I had to run before people said I came to Lagos to destroy their marriage. - You understand? - What is this? I-I didn't want to leave, but... I didn't have a choice. - This was not my plan. - I know. None of us planned to live like this. It's okay. You can go back to your class. Thank you, ma'am. Aren't you going to fire me? No. What for? I won't want you to lose a school child. If you win her back, we won't have to worry about that. How is that even possible? She still loves you. And how do you know that? A woman's eyes is the window to her heart. Inspector Dave. Tuvi, how are you? You look splendid. What's the occasion? How may I help you? In more ways than one. Obus, your childhood friend... When was the last time you saw him? About a month ago. Were you on good terms with him before he died? My father raised him like his own son. We were like brothers. - So what happened? - What do mean what happened? Did he complain about anyone threatening to kill him? Did you know anyone he had as enemies or anyone he was at loggerheads with? No. I'm on my way out. If you find his killer, let me know. I sure will. Watch your back, Tuvi. It's a dangerous world out there. Fuck you. No, I don't think I would. You know it's because you're a bit educated that Tuvi gives you all the big jobs. Are you trying to say I'm not beautiful? - Of course you're beautiful. - Uh-huh. But you know you also speak good English. Am I not beautiful too? Yet he dumps me by the roadside for bat and rat to eat. Wow! It's good to be educated. If I could, I would go back to school... What? Why are you stalking me? What do you want? I resigned. Please return Peter to the school. Please. See... See... Ola, tell this guy. If you come near me again, I will kill you! Wh-What is this? - Is that him? - It's him! Wow! The guy is handsome! - Your phone. - I'm sorry. - Brasko. - Mm! Kome, my love. Come, come, come, come. Brasko, you know, business first. Business first, eh? - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Junior! - Don't ever call me that name again. What will you do? - Try it. - Hey, guys, please. Let's do business first. Tuvi. Brasko. That was your father speaking. - All right, let's do business. - All right, good, good. - Twenty kilos. - Are you sure? Brasko, you can weigh it. - Really? - Yes. - Do you want to count it? - Ah, no. I trust Brasko. Kome. I wasn't sure you got my text message. And I wasn't sure it was a human being that sent it. How in the world did you even get my number? The head teacher gave it to me when I asked her... Look, I'm not here to listen to your bullshit. I told my son that you were dead. So stay dead and stay out of our lives. I believe we're clear, right? - Kome. - What? What? I slept and woke up with this picture for seven years. Goodbye, Kome. Ma'am, it's not working. And the more I try, the more she hates me. The harder it gets, the closer you are to her heart. Look here. Go and try harder. I have work to do. - Thank you, ma'am. - You're welcome. Peter. Why aren't you ready for school? My mummy's still sleeping. Wow. Oh, shit! Peter. Excuse me. Hi. Who do you think you are to come into my house? Kome, put the knife down, please. Get out of my house. Kome, I came to look for you, - but you were gone. - Hey! Just go! Kome, just... Osas, if you take one more step forward, I swear I will kill you. Let me make it easy for you. Mummy... Do it. I came here prepared to die. At least your face will be the last thing I see. Do it. Release me from my misery. Do it. Do it! - Kill me. - Stop! - Do it. - Stop! Come here. Peter, I'm sorry. What a coincidence. What are you doing here? Interesting question. I can ask you the same, you know. Are you trying to get me killed? Why are you following me? - We had a deal. - Yes, for me to come to you when I had something, and I don't have any information yet. Make it quick. Time is running out, okay? Please stop following me. Please. Hi. Hi. I, uh... I want to take Peter out. No, thanks. Kome, when was the last time you took Peter out to play like every other child on a Saturday? Well, that's none of your business. Kome, Peter is my son too. What? What did you say? Where were you when I had that boy under the bridge? When he almost died of malaria? Osas... Osas, where were you? - Kome, calm down, please. - And you dare stand here and tell me... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Be very careful with this leeway you have. Otherwise you will never see him again, and I'm serious. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. He's inside. Thanks. Hey, Peter. Okay. Uncle Osas is here to... to take you out. What is it, baby? You mean, my father is here to take me out. - What? - I heard him. I trusted you, but you lied. No, wait. Peter. Peter, listen. Listen, I... Can you just dress me up, please? Peter... Okay. This gap between your teeth is charming me. - So how many of you am I going to service? - Ah, just me. Can you finish only me? What's your problem? I'm on fire. All right, go and pay my manager. - Oh, it's pay before service. - Yes, normal practice. - The guy wearing a hard face? - It's all about the money. - Hurry up. Let's go. - Don't you know I'm feeling horny? Kome, look. Sheyi Bucknor. Telecom giant and business tycoon. That will be your man for tonight. I need his money. Can I at least finish my drink first? What are you doing here? How did you find me? Does it matter? Does it matter? Osas, you can't be here. Kome, what are you doing here? What does it look like I'm doing? Kome, you need to stop this. Who the fuck are you to tell me how to live my life? Eh? Osas, you need to just leave. You've done enough already. Please. Kome, I can't let you continue like this. I won't. I said go. - Kome... - Go. - Kome, just... - Go! - Go. - Kome, just... I was just having a conversation. I was just... Tuvi, Tuvi, Tuvi. Please, please. Tuvi, Tuvi, Tuvi, Tuvi! Tuvi, please, please, please, please. Kome! What is wrong with you? Do you want to die? Get out of here! - Give me my money. - Calm down. - What is your problem now? - Give me my money. Are you saying you didn't enjoy it yesterday? What is all this? Didn't you enjoy doing it? I'm not going any... I'm not coming down. Complete my money. You have to complete... - Get into the car. Let's go. - Complete my money. Complete my money now! My bag! Hey! My bag! What is wrong with you guys? Wonderful. They only paid for one person at the club. Getting to the room, I found four boys. If you see what they did to me... like I was not a human being. I'm tired of prostitution. Ola, are you sure you don't want to tell Tuvi this? Ah, no, no, no, please. I don't want Tuvi to kill anybody because of me. Ola, you know what you should do? Just... go into the house, all right? Have your bath and relax. Don't cry. You're strong. You're strong. Just go have your bath and relax. I'll call you and also come back to check up on you. Thank you. Ola, don't cry, all right? Hold on. Kome, what has gotten into you? This is not you. Prostitution? Come on! You don't have any right to judge me! My son was dying, and I did what I had to do. Osas... Osas, you don't know the things I've been through. So don't... Kome. Kome, you don't have to. We can start all over again. We can put all that behind us. Please. Yeah. Yeah. Get out of my house. Kome... Don't make me get angry. Get out... Help me. I can't, I can't, I can't. - Kome, look at me. - No, no, I can't. - I love you. - No, no, no. I never stopped loving you, not for one day. Don't say that. Please don't say that. I can't. He's n... He's never going to allow me to leave. - Who? - He'll never allow me to leave. - Who? - Tuvi! - Who is Tuvi? - Tuvi is... Hey, Tuvi. Good morning. Good... Good... Good morning... sir. Who are you? - I-I... - Uh, this is... This is... This is Peter's, uh, teacher. Peter's teacher. Are you also his nanny? Because today is Saturday. Um, I'm just his teacher. - Mummy... - Go to your room. I don't want to see you here again. - Okay, sir. - Get out. Teacher... did you fuck her? No, sir. It's okay. You can fuck her... if you have big money. But clearly, you don't. So... stay away... or I will kill you. Hmm? Wait. This, your face... It looks like something I've slapped before. It's not me. He's lying. - Are you sure? - I said it's not me. Hmm. Be careful what you do... because you will never enjoy what I will do if this happens again. Shh. I'm hungry. Fix something! Get me the remote. Hey. Check what she's doing. - Steady! - Stand up. I can shout. St... Steady! Don't stain me. Stop bleeding rubbish. Get him up! Stand up! So you think the street dog has no owner, eh? Eh? Brother, please... Brother, please... Name and place of work. Name and place of work! Get him up! Stand up! Steady. My name is Pedro, sir. My name is Pedro. I work with Q-Tech Communications. How much do you earn? One... One-fifty. 150,000. Now, listen. For the next six months, you will be remitting your salary to me. Hmm? Hmm? Get him up! This one is just lazy. Stand up! You know the club where you picked up the whore? Skip one month and die. Are you okay? Um, I wanted to return this. Thanks. Osas... I need you to stay away. Please. - What are you talking about? - Osas, it's for your own safety. Kome... Kome, you know I can't do that. I would rather die. Tuvi... Tuvi is a cold-blooded animal... and I am not ready to put my son's life at risk. Please. Oh! I need to take you to Auntie Obehi's hospital, you hear? - No. - Shh. Don't you want to get better? Hmm? Hello, Auntie. Auntie, good day. I'm fine, thank you. - Get into the car. - For what? What kind of... I said get into the car. Where... Where are you guys taking me? Hey, teacher. Look at this here. My agent, he lost 200 of my beautiful girls to a terrorist group in the Republic of Niger. Why? Because he wanted to make extra cash. Each of those girls cost $12,500. Hmm? He was shipped to me from Abuja last night with his birthday cake... and this gorgeous wine. I guess Kome never told you what happened to the last guy she fell in love with. Eat. Drink. So... let us celebrate with our friend. Come on. Drink. Good. Help me kill him. Wait, wait, wait, wait. One... two... three. I can't do it. I can't do it. Please... I can't do it. Of course. I knew. Jesus! Jesus Christ! You need him more than you've ever needed him before. Go ahead! Call Jesus to save you from my bullet. Please. Please don't kill me. I have a son I just met. Please. Please. Peter. Just as I suspected, boss. - Peter's father. - Yours truly, boss. What do I do with him? Let's still keep him, boss. You might still need him. Tie him up. Good evening, sir. Why are you shaking? Good boy. We'll see each other at the end of April. - Please, sir. - Leave. I have a family. I have... I have a family. You have a family, yet doing something else, idiot. Shit! Yeah. Not on my floor. When you finish, find Kome. - Please stop at the blue gate. - Okay, you've reached? Yes, here. Here, here, here. Thank you. My phone! I thought I told you to stay away from me. What do you want? Tuvi tried to kill me. He wants me dead. - Shit. - Let's run away together. Look around you, Kome. There's no life here. I mean, I'd rather stay here and die than go without you. No, Osas. Listen, listen. This will hurt Tuvi's ego, and he will do anything to find you. Just get Peter and let's go! I can't. He's at the hospital with my aunt. He's feeling ill. - Then let's just... - Okay, okay, okay. Okay, let me just get some of my things, and... Kome! Kome! Kome! - I think we should go to the police. - No, there's no need. Tuvi has his father's connections. He won't stay in jail for long. And, Osas, even if he does, if he ever finds out I'm the one who snitched, he would kill me, and he wouldn't spare my son. He wouldn't spare our son either. Ah, Tuvi. What happened? Where's Kome? Kome? She's the one I came to look for. She's the one you came to look for? Yes. Did something happen? No, nothing happened. Come. Sit down. Tuvi, please. Why are you pleading? I thought you said you didn't see Kome. Tuvi, please. I don't know where Kome is, I swear. Ola... where is Kome? I don't know. Tuvi, I don't know. The last place I saw her was at the club. Tuvi, I swear, I don't know where Kome is. I swear. Ola, where is Kome? I don't know. The last time I saw her was yesterday at the club. I've not had a finger smoothie for a while. Tuvi, please. Tuvi, please. Tuvi, please, no. Tuvi, please, please, please! Tuvi, please! Tuvi! Tuvi please! Tuvi please, please! Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay. I'm listening. Kome called me this afternoon. Yes. I'm listening to you. She asked me to go to her house, get Wale Coker's business card... and text her the number. Wale Coker? Yes. Is that all? Wait, wait! Wh-What's in the bag? Cocaine. - Jesus Christ! - Osas, calm down. I have never seen cocaine in my life except on TV. Calm down, please. Please listen. Tuvi doesn't pay me. He only gives me what I need and allows me to drive his car. So this is the only way. You have to trust me, Osas. - Can you drive? - Yeah, I can drive. Hello? Are you serious? All right, okay. Nice one, nice one. Thanks. Ah! Boss... Kome went to the store, took 15 kilograms of our cocaine. The only buyer I think she can sell to... - is Brasko. - Brasko. Brasko. Let's go pay that bastard a visit. Um, hold on. Let me see if I can call a buyer that might be interested. - Yeah? - Thank you, thank you. Hang on. Um... Yeah, I can hear you. Tuvi. Speed up. Where are they? They were... Okay, Brasko is the name of the man we are going to see. No eye contact. Osas, the man kills for less. Okay, just stand there and be tough. I'll do the talking. No smiling. How can I even smile? We're carrying real cocaine. See, just... Just relax, Osas. You can do this, okay? Just relax. Oh, my God. Let's go. Ooh. One. Don't worry. That's just one. I trust you. Oh, is it not this little thing? It's me. All right, get in there! Beautiful. Beautiful. - Their father. - Beautiful. - Ah. My love! - Brasko. Who is this monkey? I'm not a monkey. I'm the new guy. Um... Brasko, let's do business first, eh? Hmm? - Let's talk business. - Okay. - You and I know how this runs, hmm? - I know. The last one I bought is not finished yet. I know, I know. But I'll do it for you. I'll do it for you, all right? Thank you. Okay, so what are you saying now? 2.5 million. - Two... - Come on. But, Brasko, on a normal day for this, we'll be talking between six and 6.5. Okay, you know what? Let's just settle for three. Brasko, look... three. - Three! - I've heard you. Okay, deal. - Deal? - Yeah, deal. - Thank you. - I'm doing this because I like you. - Hmm? - Yeah. Okay. You see, this is why I like Brasko. - There's no need counting the money. - At all! - No need. - Yes. Uh... Just wait, my love. Wait. I have something to show you. Wait. - Brasko... - My latest invention to the world! Come on, my love. Shift, shift, shift, shift, shift, shift! Shift. - Ah, come on. Come on, my love. Eh? - Brasko. Bras-Brasko. Brasko! All right. - Well done. - Bye-bye. Hold. Kome is still here. Find her. All right, let's move. Did you see anything? Did you see anything? Are you sure? I didn't see anybody. Brasko. Where is Kome? Does Kome live here now? Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah. She's on my bed... naked. Return what you bought from her so nobody dies here today. When you open this chicken vent you call a mouth... don't you hear yourself? Eh? Look, it's just business. We're all in this game to win, and I'll advise you to go back home and count your loss. Kick my ball to me, man. You will pay for this. Shit! Junior! Did your mother not tell you you'll get burnt if you play with fire? Let's see who gets burnt today! Your father! Your father! Junior! Shoot, somebody! Junior! Is this your best? Huh? Is this the best you have? Fuck! Shit! Gr... Grenade. Yes. We are all in the game to win. Do you have the information we need? Sir, did you hear what I just said? Our lives are in danger. That's the only way we can help... put him away for good. Put him a... You really think putting him away would help? Yes, it would, because we need better evidence. I see we're on our own, so... Osas, let's go. To where? What do you intend to do? - You need us. - We don't fucking need you! Let's go. I was expecting that reaction. I think we should have at least told them why we came... the visas. Osas, they don't care about us. Don't you get it? Can I please drive? Drive. I think I know where we should go. Tuvi! Tuvi, wait. Tuvi! Tuvi! Help! Help! Get the car! No, no, no, no. No chasing. No running, please. No weapon. This is all I have. We need your help. It's my friend, Illegal, that was asked to go kill Kome's child. We were together smoking when Tuvi called him. He told him to go to Diana Hospital and kill the boy. Uh, see, brother, this information I'm giving you guys is it confidential? It is confidential. Are you sure it's to the warehouse he took them? Yes! See, brother, I'm very sure of that. Anytime Tuvi wants to torture anybody, that's where he takes them. - How many of them do you think are there? - I don't know. Like, eight. - Then let's call for backup. - That won't be necessary, okay? Oh, my God! There are three things you can never do without in this life... love, trust and help. These three things I have invested in you, Kome. And that's the reason I can never, never, ever let you go. So I will give you one last chance to return to your chain. Kill this parasite. Take it! It's over, Kome. Do it. - Do it! - Listen to baby papa. Pull the trigger and let everything return to normal. - Tuvi, do your worst. - Ah! You have to choose, Kome. Peter or baby papa. - Who dies? - You will never find Peter. Never! You of all people should know that Peter is with your aunt in the hospital. I assumed you would need a little motivation, so I sent someone there pretending to be a friend with a gift. You bastard! Be patient. He should be there by now, waiting for my call. So I suggest you pick up that gun and kill this sack of shit, or Peter dies! You may kill us... but you will never win this fight, Tuvi. Freeze! Your hands where I can see them. Osas! Scorpion, go, go! Osas! Osas! Osas! Let me go! Let me go! Tuvi! Tuvi! Love. What a senseless phenomenon. Tuvi, stay back. Tuvi, please! Fool. I count all my bullets. Hey. Hey! Stay with me. Stay with me. Look at me. Open your eyes, open your eyes. Tuvi! Help!
