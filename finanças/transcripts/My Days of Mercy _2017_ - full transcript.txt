Would you cut that out? Ben, you got your sunblock? It's going to be hot. Yeah, I got it. - Lucy? - I'm trying to tan. You don't tan, you burn. What? Don't blame me. Blame your Scottish forefathers. - I blame you. - Figures. He did not help. I blame that on your computer. You what? At the turn of the last century, children your age worked in coal mines. I'm pretty sure you can do the dishes. - Hi! - Hi! Look at you! Here's my girls. Mm. The Moro sisters. God help the men at the Department of Corrections - for trying to take you two on. - We do what we can. Now, how about you? Two-thirds of a man and halfway to handsome. Come on. I've got work for you. You know what's happening tomorrow, Benjamin? The American Government is going to kill a mentally disabled man. - What do you think about that? - I think it's bad. How much longer you got? - Next week. - Next week? Murderer! Murderer! Murderers! Go back to where you came from. Murderer! Keep to your side of the fence, please. Keep to your side of the fence, please. Stay in your groups. Stay in your area. It's been a long wait for justice. It's taken its toll and we're just glad it's coming to an end. Now, there's been significant public backlash about a mentally disabled man being put to death. Do you have any thoughts on that? He had sense enough to point a gun and pull the trigger. And now he's going to have to pay for it. Hopefully, once he's gone we can all start to move on. Tensions are expected tomorrow between two opposing sets of protesters with a strong contingent of anti-death penalty activists expected to clash with the American Institute of Homicide Survivors. Mr. Bromage is a key member of the American Institute of Homicide Survivors... Hey. Sorry. Sorry. I didn't mean to spook you. Mercy. What? I'm Mercy. That's a pretty fucking ironic name, don't you think? Yeah, you got one of your own? Lucy. Well, that's pretty. How are things with the friends of the gas chamber? How are things at the cop killers' benevolent fund? - Didn't know he was a cop. - Yeah. He was off duty, on vacation, with his wife and kids. Was that your dad getting interviewed on TV? I saw you guys arriving. Yeah, Mike was his partner at the CPD. For 16 years. I'm sorry for your loss. Well... see you tomorrow? Yeah. Mom. ♪ And we gotta remember The Pharaoh's army ♪ ♪ They got drowned In the Red, Red Sea ♪ ♪ Oh, Mary don't you weep ♪ ♪ Tell your sister Martha ♪ Tell Martha not to mourn When we get back you could try at The Grill. They're using my resume as napkins now. That's how many times I've been in there. - You need a job. - I had a job. Note the past tense there. Shall we harvest his organs while he sleeps? How much you think we'd get for a kidney? - What? - It's weird. You sleeping here. You're, like, three sizes bigger than me. It's not my fault you got tiny feet. It's not my fault you've got flippers. Can we get a German Shepard? Why don't you play with the neighbor's dog? The neighbor's dog is dead. Tough break. Just stuff some socks in there or something. It'll be fine. - What time's your interview? - In an hour. Okay, so you'll be home in time to clean the house? I guess so. Why? Weldon's coming over to talk about the case. Which bedroom do you want me to tidy? Come on, Lucy. Just help me out, all right? He said he's got big news. - Why do you want a dog, anyways? - Protection, from intruders. Hey, you need protection? You got me, all right? Hi. Hi. How was the public hanging? An affront to moral decency. How was your weekend? Likewise. Now, what's with the outfit? Just trying to make myself look more employable. Is it working? I don't know. Is it? You want a drink? Beer. - And nuts. - Hi. - Katlin. - Lucy. Is that a resume? Yeah. You hear I'm leaving town? No, I must have missed the announcement. I got a job in Toledo. Two weeks and I'm out of this dump. Toledo. Being Homecoming Queen's finally paying off, huh? Anyway, if I don't see you between then and now, have a nice life. Thanks. It's on my to-do list. Do you remember Al Newbury's Christmas party? I never told anyone, you know. Told them what? That you're a pervert. Good luck in the city. Say hi to your dad for me. How long do I have to sit here before you give me a fucking job? I reckon we're going to find out. So I have good news and I have less good news. We knew it was coming. It doesn't change anything. They set the date. At least now we know. Four months. So we got to move fast. Hey, listen. It'll be fine. This is what I do, this is my thing. I'm good at this. I promise. Okay? The good news is the witness. That's where we need to be focusing our attention. You couldn't do it before. What makes you think you can do it now? I've been digging around. I found an old buddy of his who told me the guy got thrown out of college for smoking too much pot and missing class. That's it? - Lucy. - That's it? - Cases have been won on less. - Maybe in fucking Burma! - Lucy, shut up. - No, it's okay. I'm not pretending this is video evidence or a signed confession, but this is something. Look, the witness is an addict. He's hopelessly hooked on marijuana. He saw the world through a drug haze. How could he possibly be sure he saw what he said he saw when it was dark, and he was high? So you're not trying to prove that our dad didn't do it? Discrediting the witness is basically the same thing. No! It is not basically the same thing! You said you'd prove he was innocent! I got four months before the judge sends your dad to the chamber. So I got to work with what I got to work with. I'm sure you're going to spend the time productively. Lucy, why don't you go check on Ben and see if he's okay? Well, I was right. How'd it go with douchebag? Well, aren't you glad you didn't... Great. How is that the best... We're really knocking it out of the park. That was the worst... We could take you to the best place to spin in the whole forest. I would very much like that. How's the pro-boning? Well, anyway... when this is all over, you'll thank me. I don't want to hear it, Lucy. You don't have to keep doing it. - I like Shane. - He makes me feel ill. Well, you don't have to talk to him. Just let me deal with it. Four months. A little gas money. - Aggie, no, no, no. - No what? I don't get to spend my money how I please? You got friends, girl. Let me help. Thanks. Whose daddy is that? - Hey, Mandy? - Whose daddy is that? Can you make those letters bigger? I want the cameras to be able to read those signs. Okay, honey? You sound like me. Oh! It's funny, isn't it? - It's funny. - Good job. Hi. Hi. One execution wasn't enough for you, huh? Oh, I'm sorry. Am I crashing your party? Technically not a party. Hey, you got any beer or anything? - Uh, got soda. - I guess that'll have to do. Okay. - Here. - Thanks. Nice RV. It's like a million years old. RV-saurus? Basically extinct, yeah. That's it right there. Real good. I've got to get back. I stay in this den of iniquity too long, and the good Lord's likely to strike me down. Come on. It's not that bad, is it? No. Hey, I was thinking about walking into town later. Get a real drink. You want to come? - Sure. - Well, don't sound too excited. No, it's just I didn't... I don't think we're supposed to... - fraternize. I... - Oh. Right. Is there a law against it? An unwritten one. Those are the easiest ones to break in my experience. So just go for a smoke around eight. Okay? - Okay. - Try and muster up - some enthusiasm by then. - Well, I... Ben, stop picking at it. Just eat your food. It's gross. I didn't ask for a review, just eat it. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Rewind. - What do you mean "gross"? - I mean it's gross. This is barely food. Dude. I spent at least ten minutes making this dish. I mean, this is my dish. This is my specialty dish. - I always make this dish. - And it always tastes like ass. Ben! I mean, I can't even believe what I'm hearing right now. I mean, this is the entire extent of my culinary oeuvre, and you're telling me it doesn't even taste good? Yeah. It could be time for you to learn a new recipe. - Et fucking tu, Martha? - Lucy. Mom taught me this. I'm pretty sure it's the only dish she could make. I'm pretty sure it's the only thing Dad would eat. She could burn in drive-through, that woman. - You used to get drive-through? - Sometimes. Anyway, I like it. So... I'm probably going to be out late. For what? I'm meeting a friend. You don't have any friends in Virginia. Actually, the state motto for a while, I think. Can we just get pizza instead? Oh, my God, this kid is breaking my heart. Just eat your ass and cheese. I mean mac and cheese. God. - Hi. - Jesus! So, you got a boyfriend, or whatever? Um, I'm single. What is wrong with the citizens of Ohio? I don't think we have enough time to answer that question. Well, it's their loss. They seem to be coping okay. They don't appreciate a vision of perfection when they see one. Uh, do you have a boyfriend, or whatever? I'm between boyfriends. - That sounds uncomfortable. - Yeah, it is. - Well, I am seeing this guy. - He sounds like a jerk. Ohio. It has a nice ring to it. Spoken like someone who's never been there. - What about you? - Bastogne, Illinois. They don't have the death penalty in Illinois. You can imagine the letters my mother has written. - What do you do there? - I work in a law firm. - Like, as a lawyer? - Junior lawyer. I hate lawyers. Thanks! You seem okay. Two beers. So why'd you come back? Um, I don't know, having those people there for us. It made a difference. I guess I just wanted to give something back. How come you didn't go in and watch too? Wow. You really do just spy on me at these things, huh? Well, you come all that way and you missed the big show. I... just figure that's the best bit for you. I'm glad he's dead. How's that? Kind of scary. My dad will never be the same. Everything will always be a little bit worse. My dad will always be a little bit worse. That man destroyed my world. Now he's dead. I move on. So fuck him. Lady Vengeance. That was intense. So how'd you get into it then? Your mom make you? Martha's not my mom. She's my sister. And that was your little brother? Yeah. You're a little troupe of sibling activists. Where's the parents? My mom's dead. Shit. I'm so sorry. Where'd you get your parents from anyway? A catalog? Hey, now. That's nice. Really. I reckon you're drunk enough to tell me your sad story. What makes you think I have a sad story? You're way too interesting not to. So where's your dad? He's in the state pen. What's he serving? He's on H wing. Sandusky Wood. H isn't... the wing that you want to be on... if you know what I mean. Your mom? When? Eight years ago. I came home from a friend's house and I, uh... I found her in the living room. She had been stabbed and, um... Uh, my dad, he was supposed to be across town that night, but someone... They saw some guy that looked like him, like, a few blocks away, throw something in a bush. A weapon? Yeah. But, you know, there's, like... There's holes in the case. You don't think he did it? He says he didn't. I mean, we have this lawyer and he's got, like, three guys off death row and... But we can't afford him, so Martha's like fucking... Shit! It's okay. And we go to all these, like, stupid fucking protests, like it's going to make a fucking difference. - Hey. - Hi! I'm hungover. I'm sorry. I didn't, uh... mean for last night to turn into such a... counseling session. It's just... booze. I should probably never drink it. So, are you all right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Okay, 'cause... we got to go. I'll be thinking about you, Lucy Moro. Lucy. It's my turn on the laptop. I'm on it. What are you doing? I'm writing the Great American Novel. What? I'm looking at porn, okay? Go away. - You look good. - Yeah? Yeah. You look happy. Did I tell you we were on TV? - No. Get out of here. - Yeah. A news report in Virginia. And you can see Ben in the background with signs and everything. It's on YouTube. - YouTube? - Yeah. Oh. I brought this. He's basically my height already. Martha was saying that she thinks there's a model in the family. I was assuming it was me, but I'm beginning to wonder. He's not giving you any trouble? No. He's a good kid. - He'd love to come visit soon. - Yeah, I know. You know, it's just been a while and, uh... The lawyer was here. He told me about the witness. He seems to think it's good news. Yeah. What? You don't think so? There's got to be something, right? I mean, that proves it, that proves you weren't there. He's just covering all the angles. I just thought you wanted your name cleared is all. I wanna get out of here. Hey. How's the house? It's okay. And the garden? Fine. Your mother loved that garden. She could have planted a cherry tree in the desert. How about that boiler? Did you get it checked? I will. You wait for it to pack in, they'll charge you double because they know you're desperate. You've got two girls living alone... It's not cheap is the thing. People take advantage. In these protests, there's guys there, right? Yeah. 'Cause you need to tell your sister to hurry up and meet someone. 'Cause I know I'm not going to be able to meet my grandchildren, so... I want to know that there are some on the way at least. Well, I'll tell her to put herself around more. That's not what I mean. And you neither. You don't have to worry about me. Of course I worry. I'm your father. Hey. Small hands... give me some affection. - I miss you, darling. - You too, Dad. Hey! What are you doing? Okay. Fuck! - Hi! - Hi. Hi, hey, hello. - Hello. - Hello. I'm sorry. I said that already, I guess, yeah. Yeah. A few times. Hi. So? What's up? Um, nothing. Nothing. I'm just, um... I... What's up with you? Sorry. I hope it's not weird that I called. It's super weird. It's... It's extremely weird. I... I think you're... a freak. No! It's fine! It's fine! It's fine! Um, is that your office, or... Yeah. It's my boss's, but he's at lunch, so... You law types are so fancy. Yeah. I know, right? With our sandwiches and everything. Lucy, I want to use the laptop. I'm on it. I'm playing Warcraft! Everyone's waiting for me. - You said I could have it. - Your dumb game can wait, Benny. It's not dumb! I'm a healer now, shithead! People need me! No! Open the door! Fucking hell! I always wanted a little brother. Well, send me your address. I'll FedEx him over. No, just send yourself. Right. Yeah, I'll just... hop in a crate and wait for you to open it? Better yet, I'll get in with you, we could post ourselves away. I'll get some stamps? Where do you want to go? Well, everywhere, I guess. Look, I was actually calling 'cause I spoke to my boss. He's like a proper lawyer, not like me. And, um... I hope this isn't too forward, but, uh, we work with this lab in Chicago, and they have this new chemical process. And the technology has improved so much that you can sometimes find new stuff on old evidence. And they owe us a favor, so I could put you in touch with them. If you wanted. Wow. Th... Thank you so much. I don't know what to say. You don't have to say anything. Look at you... fighting the death penalty. Only for the innocent ones. Why aren't we doing Indiana? Forty-year-old guy shot his business partner. Who cares? No. We're going to Missouri next month. Fuck yeah! There's that great barbecue place on the way. I do love barbecue. You talk to Weldon about the tests? Yeah. He doesn't think they're a good idea. - Why? - I don't know, he's probably annoyed somebody else is helping out. I told him to get them, though. Should we ask Dad... if he thinks it's a good idea? Why wouldn't he think it's a good idea? Yeah. I guess... I guess if something comes up then that's good, right? Well, obviously. Well, Mercy seems pretty confident that something could come up, and she works at a law firm. Does she work at a law firm? I don't think I've heard you mention that before. So, I guess your boyfriend will come back again then? I guess so. That's good 'cause you like him so, so much. Uh-huh. Dad asked why you haven't had kids yet. Because I'm still looking after his. How you feeling, dude? Not good. Try to get some rest, buddy. Remember the terms. You gotta kill him before he bites you. Doesn't matter if he's our brother. Shut up, Lucy. He can't go to Missouri like this. Will you be okay to stay home and take care of him? Why do I have to stay? I can go. You want to go all the way to Missouri on your own? You've never gone to one of these by yourself. - So? I can't start now? - I know why you want to go. - It's what Dad wants. - It is not what Dad wants. - Martha, come on. - No! End of the discussion.

Mom thinks that God hasn't created anything that can't be improved by a judging panel. So you must have really wanted to see this one, huh? Sure did. What are you thinking about? It's stupid. Well, obviously. Seriously, what? I used to go to the river with my Dad. You see, he loved fishing, but Martha and my mom hated it. So, you know, I'd end up going on my own. But then, like, a few hours later, they would, like, show up and be like, "Oh, we just went for a walk," you know? And then... Martha and I would end up, like, playing in the water or whatever and then we'd... look and see my dad and mom kissing. You know, and we'd just, like... scream and freak out, and they're, like, laughing. You know, I think that only happened once. I think we only went to the river one single time. But it feels like more, you know. We should probably go, huh? Yeah, I guess so. You falling asleep? No. Liar. Yeah. You can stay, you know. Like, if you wanted... to. Like, you could... I should probably get back. I met with the victim's mom. She was... so broken. So sad. How do you ever come back from that? Maybe you don't. You think you ever will? When Mike's killer was executed, my parents felt this massive weight lifted. Like they could finally breathe again. That's what I want for you. We're not the same, you know? I know. I'm sorry your dad's partner got himself shot, but it was my mom. That's my fucking dad that you're talking about. I'll feel better if they kill him? No. That's not what I meant. I mean, it's so great... that lethally injecting a mentally disabled man is the key to solving your grief. But my shit's a little more complicated. - Lucy, I... - Can you go? - Hold on. - Can you just go? Okay. Lucy? You in there, honey? You okay? He didn't do it. - I know. - No, you don't. You don't know. No one does. But I still don't give you permission to stick a needle in his arm and kill him. I don't fucking give you that! What are you doing? I'm driving you home. How are you going to get home? Don't worry about it. You're splitting gas money though, right? And he hits it. Out there at third. - No. - Out at second... Who's your team? The Schaumburg Boomers. Were they named by Dr. Seuss? A boomer is a type of prairie chicken. Oh, okay. Well, that's not ridiculous at all then. Just be quiet. Let me listen to this, dude. So the ball flies... The Gulfside Prison for Women in Alabama. Delmarva Correctional. Uh, the George Reed Facility. That's in Delaware. Uh, Tulsa Penitentiary. And then the Hunters Creek unit in Texas. I've been there a lot obviously. The South Fork Branch Facility... Maybe just list prisons you haven't been to. Yeah? - Grieve? - No. - Girder? - No. Girls? I give up. Well, we have five hours of driving left, so I'm confident you'll get it. - Gas meter! - No. - Grit. - Did you say grass? - Grit. - Oh, no. - Grass. - No. Okay, so tell me about your love life. Um, well, there was, like, a brief relationship back in school. Toby. - Oh. Sounds nice. - Yeah, he's okay. - Still heartbroken. - Well, naturally. Yeah, God, no. I don't know about that, but we went to prom together... - ...and it didn't go well. - What happened? Not my scene, I guess. I would love to see you in a prom dress. I wore a tuxedo. Okay. And then there was another guy. Gary. That was a little bit later. Um, but we only... That was just, you know, like, sex, only once. - And I'm still not sure why. - Did you like him? Uh, well, all the girls liked him. No, but did you like him? Uh... He had a really cool guitar. And he had a really nice English Bulldog named Betty. That is not the same thing as liking someone. - Turns out it's not, no. - Okay, so, Toby, Gary and the Bull Terrier. That's your whole love life? Well, Betty, but... And, uh... No, I, um... There were, like, a few people here and there. When was the last time you were laid? Oh, my God. That is none of your business. Like, two years? Are... Are you telling me? Or are you asking a question? I'm telling you. - You're stating a fact. - Yeah. - Two years! - What? Don't yell at me! I haven't had time for a relationship! Who is talking about a relationship? Two years! - I've been busy! - Doing what? You go on a lot of long bike rides? I don't even... I don't, come on. I... That's enough. We can stop talking about me. I'm assuming by your horrified rant that you sex a lot? What? Oh, my God, it's been so long that you've actually changed the word to a verb! Did you sex her? Do you like to sex each other? No! No, no. You're better than this. - Well, I'm not. - Well, you should be. Just fucking drive. No. No! - What? - This is my song. This is my song. Pull over! Pull over! Pull over! Pull over!

How old are you here? - Uh, thirteen. - Who took the photo? Uh... I don't know. I don't remember that day. Is this the room that you found her in? She was there. We moved the TV cabinet because we couldn't get the bloodstain up. I guess it's still there, maybe. You were by yourself? Well, Ben was in his cot, screaming. Martha was at college, so it took her an hour or so to drive back. Were there any defense wounds? Or any other marks? Yeah. And the doors and the windows? Undamaged. So it wasn't a break in. No. Whoever it was, she let them in. Or... Or they had a key? Was anything taken? Yeah, some jewelry, but they, uh... They found it with the knife. And the knife was? From the kitchen. No prints or anything. You want to ask if she was raped? Some people don't like to ask that. She wasn't, if that helps your investigation. - Sorry, I didn't... - No. It's fine. There were marks by the door. Something had happened there. She hit her head. So the doorbell had rung. So she opened it. Her attacker came in, knocked her to the ground... went inside to find something to steal. She got up, went to the kitchen. Maybe grabbed a knife. Followed him in here. He grabbed the knife from her, stabbed her... ran out and closed the door behind him. Why didn't she run out? If she was knocked down by a guy by the front door, why didn't she run out - to try and get help? - Her baby was upstairs. Would you leave your baby? Well, that's good to know. How was Missouri? Fine. - And you? You enjoy yourself? - I don't go there for that. - No? You just go there to gloat? - Martha... Ben's still sick and I have to work. Can I trust you to stay here and take care of him tomorrow? Did you believe it? What Martha said about the intruder and my mom running back in? Do you believe it? Oh, fuck. No, no. No. - No. - I really have to leave. No, no, no. Oh, hi. Who are you? I'm Mercy. I'm Lucy's friend. Okay. You must be Benjamin. Do you want anything? I just threw up in the hallway. I'm going back to bed. Okay. I'm going to leave you with that. Thanks. Um, I'll see you soon. Feel better, Ben! Oh, man! So you'll be in Georgia? Out in strength. You guys are the worst. Really? Well, maybe I won't come then. No! No! I didn't mean it. I got to go. I've got a hot date at a reasonably priced Italian chain restaurant with my boss. - Lucky. - I know, right? Wait, where are you going? I told you. I got to go get ready. I'll see you in Georgia. Oh, come on. Skip dinner! Is Martha around? She's out. Do you know where? With a guy from work. Is there something you wanted? Got some news about the case. What is it? - Maybe it can wait. - I was joking! She's out with Ben. You're too sensitive. You know that? Twenty-two years old. You're living like a middle-aged divorcee. Well, yeah. You'd know. I know she probably sees other people. I can't actually figure out whether she likes me or not. But you, I know you don't like me. You think I'm the bad guy. You like your hippie friends. How many people have they got off death row? None. Me? I've saved lives. Three of them. But I'm the asshole? It was Martha who started whatever this is. Now, I'm driving three hours to tell you something that could have been done over a five-minute phone call. I'm so sorry this has fucked up your life so much. Think she'll still want to see me when it's over? It might depend on the outcome. I always thought he did it. Your dad. Don't make a difference to me. Just... can't help having an opinion, I guess. You come all the way here just to tell me that? I came to tell you the results of the test came back from Chicago. One of the hairs they got off the crime scene matched a known criminal. Some guy up in Jersey doing a bit for assault. He could be the killer? Your father might actually be the victim of a miscarriage of justice. How's that make you feel? She's relieved! Shame on you. I thought you were a believer. I am. Well, anyway, I just came to tell you that. But I guess Martha's busy, so... She really doesn't see other people. She's loyal. What happens now? If you girls want... I'll go get some more tests done. Take a trip to Jersey, speak to this son-of-a-bitch and see what's what. You could actually prove that he didn't do it?

Huh? - Yeah. - Okay. Ben? These are ruined. Do you have another pair? You bought me another pair? No. Oh, then I don't got another pair. What's he doing here? I don't know. Just sent me out. There couldn't be a mistake? No mistake. They went over it all again, found a spot of blood on your father's shirt they missed last time. It was your mother's. What about the guy in Jersey? Moving guy. Delivered your couch. He was in a bar in Tulsa that night. They got witnesses. So these tests are the reason that they're going to kill my dad? Stabbing your mother is the reason why they're going to kill your dad. At least now we know. Hey... He didn't do it. Just because this happened this doesn't mean anything. It doesn't prove that he did it. It doesn't. - It's exactly what it proves. - No. She could have had a nosebleed. She could have cut her finger. I think he killed her. No, don't say that. Don't say that. Listen, tomorrow we are going to the prison. We're going to go. Me, you and Ben. - No. - And we're going to talk to him. - Yes, yes, yes. - No, no. - This is our family, Lucy! - This isn't a family! No, no, no, please, Lucy? Please, do not give up! Why? Why? I've been doing this since I was 14! I was a kid! And you told me! You told me he didn't do it! And I believed you. And you promised me! I followed you and I would've done anything for you, and you let me! No, Lucy, please? He's our dad. Please? No! No! I'm done! Can I help you? Come and take a seat. - Are you sure? - Yes. Absolutely. Honey, you look pale. Are you okay? I'm fine. Okay. Are you one of Mercy's college friends? Uh, no, actually, I... Well, I know her from the protests. - Really. I didn't recognize you. - She's from the other side. The other side? I'm home, guys! I've got... - Hi. - Hi. What are you doing here? I'm not really sure. Honey, let me help you with that there. Mercy? Aren't you going to introduce everyone? Yeah, um... This is my sister, Sandy. And that's her fiancé, Pete. And this is Grandma. And Mom and Dad. And this is Ian. He's my boss. That's a little formal, Merce. She's the boss of me at home. God only knows how anything gets done in that office. Have a seat, Merce. It's nice to meet you all. So, Lucy, uh, what brings you out this time of night? I'm just passing through. Where are you from? Ohio. Wow, that's a long way to come. You were in Kentucky. You know that guy killed my partner. I'm incredibly sorry about that. Sure. So, you two made friends. That's nice. A tad unusual, but nice. Yeah. Mercy's been really kind to me. Hey, can we talk for a second, Lucy? You have a boyfriend? That's great. And, what? You live with your parents or something? It's temporary. Maybe you and Ian can move in together. Why'd you come here? Because you're here. It's just complicated, isn't it? Why? You know why. Because you're not some fucking dyke? - This is my life, Lucy. - No, it's not! - This isn't you! - How do you know that? You spent a couple of days with me in the year? But this is who I am the rest of the time. Well, who you are the rest of the time fucking sucks. I just met you. I wasn't planning on... I'm just trying to go through it on my own time, okay? You don't get to choose that for me. Tell your lawyer boyfriend that his advice fucking sucks by the way. Thanks. You did everything you could. You can appeal it again. - No. - We can get more tests. Ain't no tests going to change that. - These guys made their minds up. - No. No. No. We can try. We can fight it. You're a smart girl, Martha. Always have been. I thought you'd do amazing things with your life. 'cause you're so smart. That lawyer seemed so sure that he could get me off this thing. Save my worthless life. Give me another chance with you. - You need to hear this. - No, don't say it. You need to hear this, Martha. You need to hear it. - I need to say it. - Don't! - Do you know what a boomer is? - No. It's a type of prairie chicken. - That's good to know. - I think so. There's a baseball team named after them, and they're my least favorite team. My least favorite team is the Miami Dolphins. Why? Because how could a dolphin play football? Great point. - You should write them. - I will. And the Broncos and the Seahawks and, well, pretty much everyone else. - A Bronco could kick a football. - True, yeah. Yeah, we should leave them out of it. Come on. - Why? - Go get Ben. So where you want to go? - What do you mean? - Where do you want to live? We're moving. - Really? - Yeah, really. We're going. We can go anywhere we want to go. Nothing's stopping us. Just our imaginations. - Somewhere by the sea. - Somewhere by the sea. Okay. East coast? West coast? Gulf coast? West coast. - West coast. - West coast. We've got California. Oregon. Washington. - California! - California! California! Okay. California it is! - Okay? - Okay! - Okay? - Okay! - Okay? - Okay! - Okay! - Okay! Okay, buddy. Just a little bit. To California! - California! - California! Hey. I just wanted to be here for you. Well, let's go in then. I love you. I fucking love you. You know that, right? Was he scared? Yeah. Did he say anything about me? He said he was sorry. I would have told him it was okay. Thank you. I'm going to take you home. See you on the bus, okay? Oh, my God. Thank you for coming today. I'm so sorry. So how'd you find me? Hired a private investigator. Smart. Told him to look for a small Ohian. It's Ohioan, actually. I quit my job. And I broke up with Ian. Did you tell your mom where you were going? Yeah. What'd she say? She said, "I'll be here when you get back." That's not a bad thing to say to someone. I guess it isn't. How is Martha? And Ben? Good. Yeah. Yeah, everyone's fine. And you? I can't. It's a normal fucking day and you just show up? Lu? You okay? Yeah. I'm sorry. Just, like, five minutes? No problem. I'm taking lunch orders. You want your veggie burger again? Yeah, thanks. - Pickles, relish and everything? - Sounds great. Don't rush. I am so sorry. I got to get back. Sorry. I just don't think you can come back into someone's life like this. I'm going to stick around for a few more days. So you don't have to see me, but... I'll be here. I get off at six. If you want to get out of here? Do something? Yeah, yeah, that would be nice. Where do you want to go? I don't know. Everywhere, I guess.
