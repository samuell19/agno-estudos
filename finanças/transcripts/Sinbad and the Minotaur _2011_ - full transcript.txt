And somewhere to hide. See how Minos was a powerful man. King of Menons and the Island of Crete. But it was not enough. I wanted more! Crossing the seas would be King of Crete, Rhodes as well ... Ok, Nestor, come on! Around here, Nestor, come on. After defeated by Zanus he was lost ... Rhodes decided to conclude his big victory ... He used everything that was stolen ... In a stone head stuck here ... Gotta be honest, Nestor, we're here for the treasure! They said that this island was uninhabited. Yes, it was! At the time only arrived here King Minos and some Minons, but ... ... Things can change after a thousand years. We found a bunch, right? Timos am the son of Thel. - First of all ... I speak for my people. - I'm Sinbad. And I speak for myself. The trade is over ... Outsiders are not welcome here. Timos Well, son of Thel ... - Maybe we can welcome ourselves. - Sinbad, for!

I promise you that your generosity for us will be well paid. Can have lunch in the lounge. The soldiers of Tanzim! The trade ended. His Highness received here welcome thymus. Sit down. What do you think? - Minons?! - The issue is not that ... The people ... Who can say. - What I say is that I just want food ... - The best. Hello, girl ... walks. What my eyes see is beauty itself. - What else offers this island? - Temple of runes ... maybe. Statues! There is nothing like that here, except ... - I suppose you have heard mention the Colossus. - Colossus? - A mountain near the village. - What a strange name for a mountain. Strange, but it is exactly where we go. Spread out, his loafers. Ruins or brands. Something strange may indicate where the monster is ... What exactly is that we seek? Some great work beyond your imagination. Wait, Captain. Found something! He said, Chief. It smells like a farm pigs burned ... Did you mean it seems. - Stay close. - Why? I'm scared! Follow me. King Minos won the gods or took it. - It looks more like a temple to Helios. - Somebody's been here before. - Beware of a priest. - Maybe. We may not be the only on the mountain. There is only one way to find out. Which way? Let me see. What the prophet says about this place? - We are inside a volcano. - What carries it? The volcano is inactive. - Sinbad - Wait. - What was that sound? - Came from one of the corridors. - The corridors do not give anywhere. - We are paralyzed. It is a maze. A maze! - It seems that King Minos made it difficult to search the head of the Colossus. - Probably. - We are walking laps. - We've been here. Sinbaaad! Help him, Chief. Is closing. One of Gods saved him. In training! What is this? Stay in position. Nestor! Boss! Fast. Volcanic gas. Boss! Boss! Sinbad, stay where you are. Chief, where are you? I do not know! - You are with others? - No. He comes like a storm, Sinbad. The others are ... The others are what? Boss! Sinbaaad! This way. Boss! Your death will be avenged, my friend. Sinbad. You ... This way. Wait. Wait. - What are you doing? - Where Tatum was almost dropped. Stay behind the wall. Come! Come! I found them. This way. Sinbad The monster? Died. At Sinbad, the slayer of the monster! The brothers ... We lost today! That the Gods keep as warriors. Again, again, more gifts. Come, come ... us drink a good wine. Good people become heroes. Heroes! Someone just out of curiosity heard we witnessed this morning? What is this? We did not win completely? He lowers his guard. Tomorrow morning just get the head of the Colossi. - We have yet to find it. - We know the area where it should be. Everything looks good. Where is that guardian? He's dead! Are you sure? You know what? Where did he come from? Details! Friend. Then it came to pass ... The seal of God ... More ... terrible fruit ... He was cursed by the Gods stealing the golden head ... I tell you that after getting this head Golden'll live like a king. - Who wants to be sent for you? - He said live like a king, not a king. No servant or slave. None. Tatum, you are a moron, you know. Maybe I am. Do not make deals with outsiders. Trust me. If you get what I think, will have no service in my palace. - You know, cooks, window openers ... - Wait, wait. - Do you love cats? - Do not think I need it. You know, if you're rich you have be careful. The world that you you mean there. I'm sorry for your friends. It was not your fault. Tomorrow ... Colossus! Will be rich ... eat well ... as a Sultan of Tanzim. Being a prisoner ivory tower? Being married without love? This is not for me. I am free from this prison. And I intend to remain so. How would live if you were a princess? To be honest ... it does not suit me at all. After being captured and enslaved! Escape from prison! Being with you this month! Was abandoned. What matters in this way ... So ... so ... Perfect? Maybe I'll buy a boat. - If someone is messing ... - Kill them! Hello again ... thief! Known as Sinbad. Here ... The Sinbad, is not it? At least that's what your beautiful dancer told me. - Before being killed. - Luna! I'll kill you! You'll shove this sword blunt with me. Now ... Give me the cover ... or I'll kill the rest of your companions. Why not? I do not intend to hide from you. That's good! Now ... Give me the chronicles of King Minos! So? Punctured by daggers ... the child! A child is a monster! First ... a toast! At Luna! Enough of dramas! Where ... are ... The Chronicles! I lost them! - Kill them all! - Yes, sir. You made your choice, friend. What is ... Throw this thing! - What are they? - I'm not sure. This is mine. I thought I had killed! Not so easy! Remember that? Sinbad Master ... help me! Stop, stop. The Sinbad agreed. Where is he? The Wizard? Al-Jibaro! - Where is the girl? - Sinbad, she ... she ... She what? Sinbad Tara? Tara? - Stop, Sinbad. - Get out of my way. - Look! These people er?o monsters! - He killed her? The chronicles say they were killed by the Minotaur ... ... Through the high priest. Do not you see, Sinbad? The princess, the monster, everything is connected. - I'll kill the beast! - It will offend the gods, you know? - What? - Remember what I said? The queen gave innocent his newborn son. - Minos was the father. He was a son of God. - And then? This monster is a God of Sparta! Wants to kill him? All they have is hate. - All I want is to find Tara. - Al-Jibaro took her. Sorry, pal. She died. Listen. We return to very fast boat ... Before these creatures return. He's right, Chief. We must go.
