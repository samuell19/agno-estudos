SUGAR I don't need any help, Zé Neguinho. Thank you. Beautiful. The proposal letter has arrived ! "Kapin Cultureel"... Cultural with two "E's." It's in a foreign language, but the emails are written in Portuguese. Cabo Verde Cultural Center... Bethania, the opportunity is in your hands... Why are you having doubts ? The time is now... You know, Wanderley's Sugar Mill is not in a good situation. There's a lot of workers claiming their rights over the land in court. This agreement would be the best thing for you. Let's make a deal, Bethania ! The time is now ! I got it... Do you know since when my family owns this land ? Do you know ? Do you know how old this manor house is ? Hey ! How much you're going to earn, it is not my problem. I just need one of us there. We need to know our enemies. Mrs. Bethania ? Mrs. Bethania ! Grandma delivered me here to clean up the house. Go through the back of the house. WORLD MAP OF SUGAR INDUSTRY But the price you are asking is too high... The house is not that untidy. This is the price for a house this size. Ok... But I do not want to see a speck of dirt, okay ? You better call someone else to help you... You can start now, Alessandra... You know where the stuff is, right ? In the pantry. I know. I'd like a glass of water too. Is Mrs. Isabel better ? Yes, Grandma is coming around. Great. Do you have a boyfriend ? No... But you had many, right ? I only had two... Hello ? I'm calling to have the electricity reconnected. Here at Wanderley's Sugar Mill. It's 2000... 404527. Alright, darling, can you give me Armando Queiroz, please ? Tell him it's Maria Bethania Wanderley. I'll pay you after the party, Alessandra. I'm here. It can't be this way. You have to do the right thing... You have to take responsibility, damn it ! Why do you think we are growing ? Good evening... Good evening, Bethania, come in please... Sorry to bother you, Zé... I've got a small problem with the electricity back home. Have you paid the bill ? They are not paying the rent for the sugar cane lands, are they ? But I can go there and sort things out for you. Okay. The party was good last night. Will you take much longer to finish ? The manor house of Wanderley's Sugar Mill... I remember this chandelier. It's beautiful ! Oh ! It's full of sugarcane ashes ! The girl didn't clean it properly... You must be tired. I'll take your stuff to the room. You'll stay in the prayer room. If you want to rest a little bit... ...on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us... And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. It's so good to be back here again... Alessandra ! Darling, I don't want these sheets here. Get me the white lace set that's in the drawer in Mom's room. It's alright. Godmother, come here please ! Come down here, I want you to see it up-close. This fruit comes from South East Asia. It's impressive how well it has adapted here in the rain forest. It's good for many things like diabetes, stomach ache, cholesterol... I've been told it's good even for cancer. I can't even manage to pick them all. Look how well they have adapted here. How impressive ! I really have to set up a system here that would allow me to harvest, bottle and do the whole process. Do you know how much a bottle costs in the South East of Brazil ? - Take a whiff. - Bethania, these fruits are hideous ! Dear God ! Yes, it has a strong smell. But it's good. Bethania, tell me something. What happened to the money that Diego and I lent you for the "chuchu" plantation ? What happened was that I planted it close to the sugarcane plantation. And, you know, the process of burning the sugarcane made a lot of ashes and the chuchu plant is fragile, Branca. And did not survive. But the noni is very strong ! I don't know anyone in Săo Paulo who would use this thing, this noni thing. But I know many people from there... By the way, the first person that showed it to me was from there. It's worth a lot even in international markets. I'm sure it will be a sound investment. I'm gonna make juice for you every morning while you're here and later you're gonna tell me how good you feel. Wow, what a treasure. How marvelous. I remember a smile... and a paradise I had by your side... I remember the longing... that now invades my days... To my dismay... I still remember a sad goodbye. I am now a drifting boat... in this sea of life. Where are your eyes ? Where is your smile ? And that place ? What's that ? It's the Cabo Verde Cultural Center. And now we have to deal with that ? What can I do ? Now they have the rights to that piece of land. A mill without fire is dead and will not breath again. No more beautiful views... and what was right has gone wrong... I remember Aunt Martha and Uncle Tonho helped these people. They used to work in this house... There was a lot of work, plenty of food... They were virtually the technology... They were hot water, cold water, and even sewage... Are there still potties under the beds ? There's no comfort in the house, tile by tile has fallen. Yaya is the one who built all of this in the past. Now it's the opposite. And what is left today is the abandon that time has done. They are the ones who make the money. And who wants to see that ? They are getting the money from the Netherlands. With this drumming ? Yes, with this drumming and with the cultivation of tropical flowers... This country is upside down. It's hopeless ! Take a look ! Just a minute. Good evening. Good evening, Zé. Has the electricity come back ? I tried but... You know how it goes. Things take time. The electricity is unstable in the office. We have computers there and the instability can be hazardous. I know, Zé ! As I said before, I've requested it, but it doesn't depend on me. Zé Neguinho... I remember when you were a little boy. - Good evening, dona Branca. - Come in, Zé ! Sit down, please. Is it you who's drumming down there ? It's the Cabo Verde Cultural Center... I love this rootsy cultural thing. Bethania, serve us dessert. Did you know the founder of this city came from there ? From Cabo Verde, in Africa. No, I didn't know that. How funny, Bethania ! I thought it had been the Portuguese. How interesting. Our people were forgotten and massacared. They were forced to forget their culture. We're trying to rescue traditions that our people don't remember anymore. Working with children, teenagers, adults... The project is big and can grow even more. Bethania told me that you are receiving support from a foreign institution. They give us a lot of support. - It's amazing ! - But the work is ours. We'll have a tourist point here to show the suffering of black folks. How they used to live in the slave quarters, how they served in the manor house. How they were forced to work in the sugar mill. We're becoming self-sufficient. And expecting to close some deals. I love this word, "self-sufficient." You know this entire region is called Rain Forest ? But what's left of it ? Nothing. They cut down the trees, there are no more tales, no more myths... The mill still stands. But without resources it will collapse. I understand, it's like a tourist point. A museum here in the house ! Or rather... Here in the mill. I travel a lot... They do everything with technology. It can even have a virtual Pillory, can you imagine ? Fantastic ! Well, it's time to go and close the office. Mrs. Branca, you are invited to see our project. Bethania is already familiar with it. Isn't that right, Bethania ? Leaving already ? You didn't even try Bethania's dessert ! Some other time, thank you. - Good night. - I'll accompany you. Thank you. So, he needs the manor house. We have to know our enemies. I love this photo when I had bangs. This day I cut my bangs unevenly to be like you, Godmother. I told my mother I wanted my hair to be like Branca's. I cut it myself and I had so much trouble styling it. But you got it. - It was beautiful ! - It was beautiful ! You already caught my accent. - It was beautiful ! - It was beautiful ! It was beautiful ! One... Two... Three... Four... and... Jon's slaves, played caxangá... Take it out, put it in... and let Zambelę come in... Warriors and warriors do zig-zig-za ! Warriors and warriors do zig-zig-za ! Good morning, Zé. I would like to visit the sugar mill. - Will you take me there ? - Sure, dona Branca. I'll take you there. This was our Slave Quarters. I know... So much suffering must have occurred around here. Alessandra ! Come here ! This uniform fits you ! And this scarf is for your head. It smells moldy ! After getting dressed, put the port glasses on that table, alright ? It's scorching hot in Săo Paulo, Diego ! You haven't been there lately. I haven't been there for two years, Branca. - Two years ? Good Lord. - Yes, it's been a while. But the climate is changing all over the world, isn't it ? That's right. Is everything alright, Bethania ? He looks more and more like Dad, doesn't he, Bethania ? He resembles Uncle Armando so much as if he were in front of my eyes. Bethania is so sweet, don't you think ? Arranging this party for me. Hey, girl ! Go into my car and grab the good whiskey bottle so we can continue drinking. Shut the door afterwards, alright ? And this house, for instance... It has thick walls... more than 200 years old. For me this place is a shithole ! I beg to differ. Just a small renovation would bring the mansion back to what it once was. Do you remember the time when dinner was served the French way ? Yes, I do. Those were good times. And Mrs. Branca ? Things are starting to take shape. The land is good. There are two dams. And also some springs. But the girl is kind of slow. She already lost a piece of land... What will become of Wanderley's Sugar Mill ? This whiskey is nice, isn't it ? Even better now that more has arrived. Do you remember Mrs. Isabel's grandson ? I've met him alright. That little nigger ! - Although... - I was impressed... He's got a plan ! Have you talked to her ? He's a leader ! Come on, I don't see a leader in that little nigger. He only talks nonsense and dreams about absurdities. This land here is for sugarcane. To grow sugarcane ! And listen to me, the only nigger I swallow is this one right here ! When we buy this place here, I will toss everyone away in a matter of seconds. As fast as a fresh sugarcane juice. Attention, please ! I would like your attention for a moment as... I would make a tribute to my goddaughter ! I gave Maria Bethania her name. Maria Bethania, do you still remember the night of Săo Joao ? My words... fell into your heart... You looked at me with tenderness. And unintentionally I put my hand in your hand. Maria Bethania you're missing all of that, don't I know. Maria Bethania, for God's sake, have pity. Today I confess... bitterly... I did not know... and was inexperienced with love. Forgive me, Bethania. Bethania, serve the guests, their dishes are empty ! Mrs. Bethania, I want to finish things up. I told you already. I'll pay you after the party ! I cleaned three days, total. - How much was it, Alessandra ? - One hundred and twenty reais. You all are so funny, aren't you ? My mother helped you all her entire life and no one remembers anymore. Your grandmother worked here all her life. And you always have food in your house, on your table, because of my family ! My mother taught Mrs. Isabel how to read ! But once it's about doing a favor, that's another story, isn't it ? A favor ? Pay what you owe me and we're good. My dear, you owe me more for your entire life than I owe you for two days of work. Don't get fresh with me, girl ! The land you live on belongs to my family. I gave it to you for Christ's sake ! Who do you think I am ? Did you actually think I wouldn't pay you, you ingrate ? I am a Wanderley ! You think I don't know what's going on ? - We are the same ! - Shut up ! The only difference is that you were brought up in this house and I wasn't ! Shut the hell up ! Shut the hell up ! What's going on, girl ? Alessandra, is this some kind of joke ? Cut it out, Alessandra ! Oh, did Diego warn me ! You can't give wings to a snake. These people will drive you insane. Today it was them, tomorrow it will be someone else. Get out of here. Sell this land ! I am this land ! I began to cry. At noon I began to cry. Remembering my father who had stayed there. At Indio beach where the boat docked. She asked me crying Oh, dear God, where am I going ? I told her, do not cry, my darling. Find comfort in life. You will be with the one you love. At the sea shore where the tide is high. At the sea shore where the tide is high. She got on her knees asking God for her death. This chandelier is mine ! SUGAR Subtitles from Wonder Woman
