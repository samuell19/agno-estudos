(SIGHS) thinking about London. Does your father still say no? He's completely opposed to the idea - says there's no point me going, because when it comes to musical ability, I'l never be first-rank. Do you think that's true? Very few will be truly great. That's what he says. He says the best I could do would only ever be second-rate, and he's not having any daughter of his scratching out a living in atravelling orchestra or slumming it in theatrical boarding houses. Hmm. That is a realistic assessment of what you might expect. It's a harum-scarum sort of life, especially for a girl. Atleast itis a life. This isn't. It's not even a real city. It's just a jumble of tin-roofed shacks 12,000 miles from anywhere. No concerts, no parks, no theatres, no shops. There are one or two shops. (CHUCKLES) Yeah, selling vegetables. A colony will never be able to offer what the great cities of Europe can. Well, then, why did he send me there? Why did he pay for me to be educated in London when all I have to come back to is this? Playing tennis and waiting for a husband - it's disgusting. No more Beethoven today. Come on, let's hear your arpeggios. Anyhow, it doesn't have to be music. If 'm not good enough, - there are lots of other things I could do. Miss Beauchamp, these items - Vignettes. They're not the type of writing I enjoy - the sex-problem story. Your readers might enjoy them. Possibly, but they're not suitable for a newspaper. What about the poems? They're very feminine. I'm hoping to publish a collection. I'm working with a friend of mine. She's doing the illustrations. Yes, well, there might be a market. (CLICKS TONGUE) But again, not our thing. You could try a magazine for those. Harpers, maybe? And if you did want to persist with the other material, you could try the Native Companion. In Australia? Worth a go. They like a sex story. Has your father read those? < Edie, how's this? READS: Dear Mr Brady, I herewith submit for publication three vignettes of Wellington life on the recommendation of Mr Mills of The Evening Post- aleading NZ newspaper. In the event of publication, I wish to use the pseudonym K Mansfield. Yours etc, etc, etc. Have you signed your real name? Of course. So he'll know you're not a man. Why on earth would I want him to think I'm aman? PAPER RUSTLES I'm just being prudent. You know, people we know take The Native Companion. George takes it. (LAUGHS) There you are. What would George think? George would be very surprised. (CHUCKLES) I like alittle fringe. Attack. Defend for Britain. Can you keep a secret? Cross your heart and hope to die. Your sister's going to be rich and famous. Why? Because I have a brain, and I have the inventive faculty. What's worse than finding a worm in your pear? Finding half a worm. (CHUCKLES) Look out. She-yal Kathleen, the Geddis girls are here - Clara, Una and Esme. I did tell you they were coming. When? Make yourself tidy and come down, please. Bugger. There's such an awful lot to do before a wedding. I never realised. Certainly more before than after. I'm sure you have your preparations well in hand. Well, Mother is masterminding the operation. As one would expect. And father pays the bills. ALL CHUCKLE I simply had no idea. There isn't time to tum around - ordering the trousseau and choosing the china.. and the silver and the crystal and the patterns of the wallpaper. Whereas afterwards, dearie me, just managing the servants and enforced childbearing. (CHUCKLES) It's hardly enforced. Really? How does one prevent it? That's enough. Well, at least, it ought to be a paid occupation, seeing as it does appear to be compulsory. If you're not paid for labour, you're nothing but a slave turning out a baby a year until you have a boy and you can stop. (CRUNCHES NOISILY) You may leave us. I've only said what is true.

No, no, I don't know much about that sort of thing myself. Anyhow, I can return them to her now you've done the copies. Yes, sir.

Is there? It looks almost childish, but it's... not. It just wants you to see things in a different way. Life doesn't look like that.

With most of our residents studying for or engaged in the performing arts, there needs to be a freedom to come and go, to be out late and so forth - that's understood. However, in return for this freedom, I do expect discretion. We don't wish to become known as an establishment where men are received in bedrooms.

I mean, if I continue to pay my board, can I keep my room? Thisis a single women's hostel. I've already let the room to someone else. So please remove the rest of your things and bring the key to my office. There's a telegram for you. It's probably urgent. It's been there for ages, but no one knew where you were. I hope it's not bad news. OMINOUS CLASSICALMUSIC I don't understand it. I don't know what you're doing any more. I'm trying to live up to this hat, that's what I'm doing. It's far too expensive. It's for courage. Hold my hand. Why didn't we meet the train? I'm not up to another station. I simply don't have another platform in me. Buck up, Jones. Look fearless. Oh God. Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh God. OMINOUS CLASSICAL MUSIC BUILDS What on earth have you got on your head? Just leave it. Take this away, would you? Keep it. I don't ever want to see it again. Would you leave us too, please? Give my regards to your father. Of course. < DOOR CLOSES What does this mean? This marriage to a man we know nothing about. A man who was never mentioned in your letters - a singing teacher. Singing and elocution. Oh, well, that makes all the difference. We learn of the match not from the bride, but from a cousin who saw a notice in the Financial Times. Would you explain yourself? I didn't think you'd want to come. No,... no, you didn't want me to thwart you. You had a notion, and you didn't want to be stopped. Because you knew we would've done our utmost to stop you from embarking upon this foolishness. That's unfair. You don't know George. No, I dont, but intend to meet him at the earliest opportunity. I need to see that he is decent and welkintentioned and that he can provide for you adequately, and that you're not throwing your life away on a tasteless whim. My husband is a respectable man. Well, I shall judge that for myself, and you will not be present at the meeting. Why? I want honest answers, Kathleen, which, unfortunately, I do not expect from you. < DOOR CLOSES Were you compelled to marry my daughter? No, indeed. I mean,... was it necessary that you wed quickly? I understand, but no. In fact,... the union is unconsummated. I'm not sure how well Katherine was prepared for the physical side of marriage, but she left me very abruptly on our wedding night, and I have not seen her since. That's extraordinary. I agree. Can you think of anything that might account for her behaviour? (SIGHS) This may seem far-fetched, but she has a friend - Miss Baker. Yes. She attended the wedding as a witness and seemed very upset - unusually so. ♪ I did wonder if there was some attachment. I see. I know they went to school together and sometimes at boarding school- Yes, thank you, Mr Bowden. Il see myself out. Aleshian attachment - those were your husband's exact words. But that's completely mad. Ida doesn't even know what a lesbian is. Well, you seem to have some idea! And even if [da is unfamiliar with the term, there may stil be unnatural feelings. There arent. She's a faithful friend. Who appears to be keeping you from your husband. (PANTS) Itisntt that. Well, then, why did you abandon him? Why? You tell me. You- You tell me. (GASPS) (WHIMPERS) SOFTLY: Kass? (GASPS) He said he never touched you. He didn't. It's not his. Look, I can't tell you who the father is. Goon, hit me if you want to! I can't tell you. He can't look after us, but I love him. MELANCHOLY CLASSICALMUSIC DOOR CLOSES ♪ TENSE CLASSICALMUSIC Everything you need and your mother just next door. Ah, the Kaiserin Elisabeth - she will be good company for you. The Jesus Christ with the thorn crown used to hang in this room, but I moved him to the passage, as he was not so cheerful to sleep with. Years from now, when you ask where you were bom, I will say, 'In Bavaria'. Mummy? You should wear your wrap - there are other guests. Will you really go? Well, how can I possibly stay? Vera's fiance has been spoken to. I don't know who did it. He was taken aside and warned not to form an alliance with our family. Because of me? Yes, you, Kathy Beauchamp-Bowden. Nonsense. Nonsense name. It's not the name I want. So, you'll play these games until you find the one that suits you? Other people take these things seriously - they don't play at marriage. Fortunately for Vera, her fiance was not dissuaded by the gossip, and her wedding will go ahead as planned. But there is nothing to keep me here, and I have no wish to stay. What? Nothing? Writer? You're not a writer. You just make things up. < You lie. Have you written one single word since you've been in London? I've been gathering experience. < Oh, certainly. You're very experienced now. Look at you - < the woman of experience. A year - that's what you said, and then you'd come home. I didn't know this would happen. No, you have no idea what this means, what's waiting for you. I'm not afraid. You should be. When we were babies, did you love us? I know you loved Chummie, but... did you love the daughters? You make it very hard, Kass. Oh, curse this button. Icandolit. (SIGHS) I wish... SOFTLY: What? I wish I hadn't married. What would you have done? Perhaps been an explorer. Where? Oh, I... Rivers of China. But you know nothing about them. Nothing. But I can feel a kind of hat I might have wom. (CHUCKLES RUEFULLY) But I didn't - I didn't travel. I still mean to. Child, what you mean to do and what you will do are very different things. Your cousin Charlotte - she had a baby when she was 15in Switzerland. A suitable family took the child. It didn't spoil her life. I can't do that. Then I don't know how you will live... or who will look after you or where you will go. Goodbye, Kathleen. HAUNTING MUSIC ALL CHATTER SOFTLY
