Hold it! Ready, set... Hi! Yo. Been waiting? Been waiting. How'd it go? Perfect! It's getting a bit warm, though. Why do we need that thing in order to find Harimao's treasure? This little bronze teddy-bear statue holds the key to it! Harimao, see, was this great thief during World War II, who committed robberies all over the Malaysian peninsula. The treasure in gold and silver he stole... from both the Japanese and British forces that we know of comes to 800 billion dollars! The hints to finding where he hid the... treasure were left to three statues... A bear, a falcon, and a monkey. But those three statues were scattered... around the world once the war ended. Yeah. They became highly valued as... antique works of art in their own right. Bear, falcon, and cops! That's monkey, I told you! Heh? It's Goemon! Yeah, I hired him as a part-timer. Part-timer? There are some prerequisites to undergoing the training required to attain enlightenment. And besides, we were just wanting another hand anyhow, right? Well, he's far better than some goofy schoolboy, I'll grant you... So tell me, what's your hourly wage? Ұ980. Ah, is that so? Hey, Lupin! Well then, part-timer-kun, shall we have you get started right away? I feel nothing. Pursue Harimao's Treasure!! Executive Producers: Yoshihiro Yamane Hidehiko Takei. Original Story: Monkey Punch.

Producers: Toshio Nakatani Yasumichi Ozaki. Still and all, she's just the way I prefer them! You mean to say you have preferences? Most impure... Executive Director: Osamu Desaki. What can I possibly say? I know this! Walther PPK-the pistol you favored while in the service. Yes, yes! I remember! This car is the one that was specially... converted during that gold smuggling case! Indeed! It's just like a museum for 007 films! Not at all. I was the model for his character, so... it's only natural that some things would be similar. It is a history of my life when I was in the... British Intelligence Agency, in that sense. I see! Well then, this must hold... memories of a beautiful KGB spy, right? The two of you, together in this compartment on the Orient Express, loving each other passionately... She was an extraordinary beauty, but she... cannot compare to your attractiveness. I'm flattered, even if you are kidding! Is something the matter, Lord Archer? My little girl, she has come home. She is a reader at one of the... universities in London. My granddaughter! Welcome home, Diana! Grandfather! They can call it "restructuring" all they want, but it's... us guys at the bottom who are the ones put out by it! And of all things, for them to cut off my travelling expenses...! Sir, we cannot have this. You mustn't... ignite any fires inside the carriage. I am by no means someone suspicious! I am Inspector Zenigata, said to be one... of the great stars of the I.C.P.O.! I don't care if you're an inspector or a president! What is not allowed is not allowed! If you'd just wait three minutes for this! Three minutes! If you can wait three minutes, then please wait three hours! Thanks to the Eurotunnel being completed... here under the Straits of Dover, it only takes three hours now to get between Paris and London! You've already arrived? Yeah! And I've already put one job away! So, how about the falcon and the monkey? Have you found out where they are? He's likely to seduce me before I can find that out from him. How come? He's in his seventies, you know. He's the man who James Bond's character was modeled after. He's more charming than you are! How can you say that? "I cannot do the... job unless it's together with you!" Who was it that told me so through her tears? Why, who indeed? Something I can do for you? You must be the secretary Grandfather has chosen. Such an enchanting woman, after all. Thank you. You'd better be careful, though. Grandfather has fast hands. Diana-san, I understand you teach... archaeology at the university in London. I'm just like a manual laborer. I'm visiting ruins all over the world... more often than I'm at the university. Go on... And so...? What!? How could we let that happen!? Is something wrong, Grandfather? There was an explosion in the Eurotunnel, and it caved in! 87 people dead, and 693 missing...! That can't be! Grandfather...! It's the truth. The cabinet has called an emergency meeting to discuss measures. I'm going to London. I'll have to consult with Lloyd's main... office as to how to deal with this. Grandfather! Being surrounded in pinches such as these... is one of my occupational hazards. This is quite the fantastic turn of events. How come? That old man is the sole underwriter... on the insurance for the Eurotunnel. For now, we head to London. London! Lloyd's Insurance. It's the largest insurance organization... in the world, with 300 years of history behind it. Insurance companies all over the world, fearing for the... worst where they have to make large cash pay-outs, take out contracts with Lloyd's. In other words, you see, they provide... insurance for insurance companies. I guess you could say they're a parent insurance company. The one underwriting the insurance is a... committee of one, a wealthy famous Englishman. So long as nothing happens, he profits, but once there's an accident... Once that happens, then what? That committee of one then has to pay everything. And if he can't pay? Then even if he is stripped down past his shorts and... made to stand naked, he still won't be forgiven! It's starting! Lord Archer, you are the sole person responsible for... insurance obligations pertaining to the Eurotunnel, yes? Are you telling him to go bankrupt? To pay for everything, even if you were to dispose of all... your property, it would still not completely cover the cost. Huh? My, my, my! What? That beautiful girl there! Do you know who she is? You know, she's the one that flew her plane past us! I'll take over this job. If you take it, will you take it? Can you take it? Allow me to quote you the numbers. Assuming you dispose of all your property at a high price, you are still short by $7 billion. As far as $7 billion goes, I once won that much in a poker game. What was the most you've ever lost? Up until now, I have never lost. Well, this would be your first loss, then? You're one of Lloyd's corporate lawyers, aren't you!? Can't you think of anything!? Unfortunately, no. Aren't you the brilliant lawyer? Thank you. It's not as if I have no other means. If my opponent is to face me with four Kings, I just need to put forward four Aces. I didn't want to have to do this, but under the circumstances, it cannot be helped. I cannot see how you have any means to cover $7 billion. The treasure. The one that Harimao has hidden. Harimao? Harimao, you say? The boss of thieves that ran riot over Malay during World War II? Harimao left the whereabouts of the treasure within three statues. If I may, briefly... If I gather those three statues together, I will know where the treasure is. Now that you mention it, I have heard... about the treasure of Harimao. I had thought the story had no basis in fact, however. I received that photo from Harimao. Harimao and I have something of a shared destiny, you see. It's a mere $7 billion. Once I find the treasure, a debt such as that will be easily repaid! However, one of the statues was stolen... from an Alaskan museum the other day. How about it, Russell-kun? Are you interested? I'm interested, Lord Archer. If you are able to carry out your... responsibilities in this matter to the... end, Lloyd Insurance will come to... place a perfect trust in you as well. I will go after the three statues. I would ask of you to take measures to... extend the deadline for my payment. Please, leave that to me. I'll play on your team, Grandfather! This is a lot different from the... excavations you do in archaeology, Diana! Antique artifacts are also my specialty! Okay, then, first we go after the falcon... statue. Our destination is Amsterdam! Understood! Say, this sounds like it's going to... be a fun job, doesn't it Jigen-chan? When women are involved, you get like this right away! Don't say that! I'll rub your beard for you! Stop that! I'm nobody suspicious, I tell you! It's the ones that say they aren't... suspicious that are most suspicious! Why, you rotten... Let me see the chief of Scotland Yard! I am Zenigata, of the I.C.P.O.! Where do you find I.C.P.O. officers that smuggle themselves... into the country by swimming the Dover Channel, you idiot!? Your mama's belly button sticks out! What, have you seen it? Come on! Well, fine! Her feet are cold then! It's YOUR mama whose shins are overrun with hair! Smoking driver! Compulsive shopper! Over-eater! Mother-in-law-abuser! I- Lupin!? Hi there, Pops! Have you been well? Sorry, but we're in a hurry! Lupin, you're under arrest! I believe you're the one under arrest here! All right! Here we are! This is one of Amsterdam's most famous sites, Milreva Castle! We've arrived at Milreva Castle. Copy. How is 007 doing? Burning with brilliance, and still... giving off plenty of male sensuality! Where are you now? On the west side of Alpha Street, right... in the middle of Amsterdam, in the canal. The canal, roger! Well then, I'll contact... you again at the designated time. Bye! Just a sec...! Come to think of it, Lord Archer's granddaughter just left for Milreva Castle. Oh? You're kidding, I don't believe it! Diana-san is coming!? Hold on! Why do you know the name of his granddaughter!? I'm very good at investigating things! You can divide up the treasure, but you can't divide up the girl. I'm only looking! You're telling me to trust you!? Fujiko-kun! Be serious about this! Yes!? Was there something...? Fujiko-kun... Y-yes? I just wanted to see your face. I'm busy, you know! This castle was the residence of Lord... Knight, until he passed away ten years ago. As stipulated in Lord Knight's will, the antiques... being kept here were all donated to the country, while the castle was purchased by the... city and opened as a tourist attraction. Are you following this, Junior? Yeah. It's quite expansive, so please try not to wander off, okay? Say, what's Goemon up to? Dunno. Still and all, how can they put all this crap on display? Judging by the fact it's not in the exhibit, it... must be somewhere that hasn't been discovered yet. It's an ages-old castle, so there has to... be one or two secret rooms somewhere. Gah! Loafing around up here, are you? Hey, you, you haven't forgotten... you're being paid by the hour, right? There is something about this Buddha that is displeasing. Yeah? What's that? That finger. Finger? The form of these fingers is nowhere... among the teachings of Buddha. You don't say. Pardon me! Hey, you didn't have to go that far... Goemon-chan, I'm raising your hourly rate! With paid vacation? For this to dead-end here is pretty inelegant, huh? What is this place, an archaic theme park? Open the red, and don't open the blue, nicely finished! Sensei, which one is the right one? This one. What were you thinking by red!? We almost became hedgehogs there, you know! You careless, irresponsible, lying, multi-level marketer! CUT!! This one. Never mind now. The red one was dangerous, and so we check the blue... Sorry to keep you waiting. Lupin! Are you all right? Lupin! Lu... pin! This is as far as it goes. Are you deserting Lupin? You're certain this is the right room? Promise me before you goes in to not be makin' no trouble. I can't afford to have my rooms gettin' all busted up. As far as that goes, it all depends on the other guy! W- waitasecond here, my livin' depends on the money! Lupin, you're under arrest! Come quietly! Damn! Like I told you, the guests in this... room've been out since this mornin'. Well then, until they return, I guess I'll wait here. In that case, make yourself comefuttable. Just a moment! Bring me some hot water. Make sure it's good and hot! What do we have here? Ah, this is perfect for holding down the top of my ramen! Seagulls flying about on the winds of Delfzijl Haven... To be able to gaze upon the shining canals of Amsterdam while I slurp up my noodles... This is certainly the life! Stay with it. We're already halfway through. Toy with me, will you? This goes here, that there, and there, and there! That should about do it. Good morning to you! This just won't do! How can a beauty such as you be a thief? Who are you? A thief. But unlike you, I'm a first-class one. Now, why don't you hand over that falcon statue? Try taking it from me. You're a pro, aren't you? Perhaps I'll steal you right along with it! You poor man. You won't be able to move... from there for the rest of your life! Let me go! Take care, first-class-thief-san! What's the matter, Lupin!? Diana got here first. Goemon... This is where my part-time service ends. You got it! There isn't time for this! Yoo-hoo!! Lupin! The falcon statue is on that cruiser! Understood. Grandfather, speed up! We're being pursued! What? We'll just see if you can get away. Hey! Don't come any closer with that! Lupin! Hi-i! Which way did the cruiser go? East-southeast. They're headed for the center of the city. East-southeast, dead ahead! Found them! They're closing in at a speed of 33 knots! Understood! Fujiko-san... Y-yes? Move aside! Do you know how to handle a gun? I've never even touched anything like a gun! Well, then at least try not to get in the way, okay? Fujiko-kun! Yes? Yes? I'd like a 17-year-old Valentine, on the rocks. Certainly. Yoo-hoo! You fool! I- Lupin! Rou're runder 'rrest, Rupin! Fujiko-kun, another. Certainly. We made it. Yes, we did. I think I'll take a drink as well. Right! Make it a double, okay? Right. What happened to those guys? They're playing with the fish! That is, if the fish are feeling bored. Lupin III, huh? Oh? Grandfather, you knew who those people were just now? Hey, hey, I was with the... Intelligence Agency for fifty years! Lupin III is one of the men I wanted to try taking on once. Here! Not very pretty, there! Now what are we going to do!? Report your current location! This... is the octopus! This is the octopus! Calling all units! Calling all units! The target is moving west on the Nigier Canal! Assemble at Mahera Bridge! Block their route and surround them! Hey, Lupin! What's all that about? Are there "Bosozoku" hot-rodders that cruise on the water too? This means it's likely we're not the only... ones who are after the falcon statue! Lupin! You miserable punk! Watch out, why don't you!? So, where are we going today? Same play as always! How improper! Don't you want to? Uh-huh! Why, you...! I don't like it when you laugh! Your girlfriend says she doesn't want to go today. I'll trade off driving with you. Hey, come on! There's someone odd coming! Diana, driver change! Okay! Fujiko-kun... Yes? Step aside for me. Right... Why don't I use the Beretta M-1938 for a change? Who the hell are you!? Grandfather! Are you okay!? You'll have to forgive me, okay Fujiko-kun? What's most important is that you're okay! All right, then...! Whoops! There they are, Lupin! There they go. Calling Archer! Calling Archer! Hey, you! Do you realize what you've just done!? You've just destroyed the Grau Bridge, a world-wide cultural treasure! In other words, you've just committed... a serious crime against humanity! Silence! Shut up and listen, Archer! We have, you see, enough missiles to destroy another... ten or twenty world-wide whatever-you-called-them! Unless you want to get blown to bits, hand over the falcon statue! Nice and quietly! We're going to take one of the women hostage as well. Right! Er, which one? You imbecile, it should be obvious! The naive one! Roger! That's you. Come on! How rude!! Wait! Where are you planning on taking Diana!? Damn you bastards! Diana!! Two by three, knight promoted. Seven by seven, attack. Four by eight, bishop. Copper general, silver general. Copper general, rook. Five by two, gold general. Three by three, silver general not promoted. Six by one, gold general. Two by two, bishop. Seven by three, rook promoted. Copper general, knight. Check! Gold general! Mate in one move! Why, you! Hand over the falcon statue! I've had enough of this! My, my, fancy meeting you here. What can I say? It's hard to believe... that we're strangers like this, huh? Hold it! Your right hand, your right hand! How rude of me! But even so... I'm here, able to look upon you up close, and the more I look, the more beautiful you become! Do you not feel that we were meant to be together? No, I don't feel so! You don't say! All right then, first things first... Lupin! Lupin! You're under arrest! This is hopeless. Lupin? I see, so that's the man who got the bear statue in Alaska. That man just now was Lupin? Is that so? Understood. I will be certain to obtain the bear statue! Lady, how long have you and Lupin been together? How insulting! I am not this man's woman! You can't fool me! He's already confessed to it! When did we feel we had something together? That first happened about half a year ago. She is hairy, but she's got a lot of spunk, and she's doing quite well at her job... Who are you calling hairy!? In any case, it's quite evident you two were working together! I'm taking you in to the head office in Paris, where we'll investigate this thoroughly! I am not his partner! Shut up! Say, Pops... As long as you're taking us, couldn't you have found something like, you know, the Orient Express? The smoking seats were all booked, and I couldn't get a reservation. So, there weren't any non-smoking seats then? You two haven't had your supper yet, have you? You know something? This is pretty good! What can I say, there are the red-labeled ones and... the blue-labeled ones, so whichever you may prefer. As for me, I like the one with the red label. Here. Here. Now listen, don't be in a hurry. Wait three minutes! And this will either make or break whether or not it tastes good. Pops, what's this? This? My specially-made ramen lid press. Nice, huh? What's with you? Can I have it? No way! I am extremely taken with this lid press. You know, I originally came across this in the hotel room you rented. Indeed so! That's actually a keepsake, you know... From who? The father of the second wife of my uncle on my mother's side. Sounds like a lie to me. Well, I guess this can't be avoided. Why, you...! Dammit, you're not getting away from me! Hold it, Lupin!! Pops, time out! Truce! Here goes... Where's the bear statue!? Is this any time to be asking about that? You mean you want me to jump off by myself!? You can bruise that springy little butt of yours, or lose your life. Pick one of the two. And what are you going to do!? Me? I have a spot of business with that helicopter there, you see. Oh look, you have a pimple here! You'll never catch a man like that, and turn into a wrinkled old lady. Dammit! Mess with me, will yo...! Lupin! Caution: Intruders! Caution: Intruders! So it's you again, Lupin? Sorry about this, but I've taken the falcon statue. What!? Liar! The statue is right here! See? I've clearly taken it, haven't I? Why, you...! Any punch I take once... I will not take a second time! That's why I'm a professional! Wouldn't you agree? Well, if you'll excuse me...! You have the teddy-bear statue. We have the statue of the falcon-san. Sorry to keep you waiting. Lupin has the milk tea and lemon for Mister Archer. What it comes down to is we split fifty-fifty. No, 70-30. We take the 70. That makes you the thief! I'd like to proceed under a gentleman's agreement. In order to obtain the treasure of Harimao, one other statue, a monkey, is necessary. I am the only one who knows the whereabouts of the monkey statue. That may indeed be true. However, I have saved the life of your granddaughter-san... not just once, but again a second and third time. You also placed me in about as many dangerous situations! Besides which, over and over, you've attempted... to engage in some lewd behavior with me! And don't pretend you didn't enjoy it. No smoking, mister. Heil, Herr Maforditte! I've been looking after you, Goering. Y- yes...? However, I find this mistake to be very difficult to forgive. I beg your forgiveness. Gather up your will to fight once again and go after them! Your destination is Thailand. Bangkok. H- Heil, Herr Maforditte...! No, you mustn't fidget! This won't hurt at all. Have you come all the way here to Bangkok in order to ensure I pay the money? Mister Archer, you have a piglet growing out of your ear. Unfortunately, your liability has grown. Primarily, it concerns the construction expenses involved in rebuilding the Eurotunnel. Due to the strength of the yen recently, the cost in building materials has risen. Even roughly calculating, it is an increase of 5 billion. Very well, very well! Be it 5 billion or 50 billion, it will all be ready once I recover Harimao's treasure! About this... treasure... Things are going smoothly. Everything is proceeding steadily according to my plans. How did it go? Nothing to it! No problem. My, my, my, you've been down at the pool, all dressed up in a swimsuit! Not to worry, these are my men. YOUR men? I will be staying at the Orient Hotel. If there are any developments, please contact me. Who are you calling your men, old-timer? Yours is thirty, ours is seventy. It's clear who is under whom here. So, shall we go? Preparations are okay, aren't they? Take a right at the next road. All right, we stay on this road for the next three hours! Right, right. It's been a while since my blood's been this excited! Adventure is certainly that which men romanticize! Um, is that Agatha Christie? Shakespeare. Is that Natsume Soseki? Monkey Punch. About Fujiko... Why do you suppose she didn't come? I am going to remain in Bangkok. You cannot do that, Fujiko-kun. Without you along, this will be a lonely trip! But you see, I hate to get all dusty, and someone has to stay in contact with Lloyd's, right? Well, that is... I suppose... that is so... I'll be praying for your success! Now don't you go astray on me! That goes double for you! You're still such an active man! Yow! Ow, I tell you! Now that you mention it, that was awful strange, wasn't it? Isn't it? That action isn't written into our little scenario. Yeah. She's even more of a bad apple than we are. About our destination... How about finally telling us where we're going before we get there? It's another hour to a checkpoint. Just get us through there without any trouble! Geez, fine... Your transit permit! Right, here you go, my brother! What's your cargo? A delivery for the 6th battalion command post. How about I give you one too? "Night of the Promiscuous Wife." I- I-is that...!? "Please, Anything But You-Know-What!" These are in Japanese, but the commanding officer likes them! Take them, you thieves! We appreciate your efforts! Don't watch them during the daytime! The mission was a success! That was an indecent tactic! I saved one out especially for you! "The Night and Nights of the Lady Teacher." This is just like the Ginza of ruins! I wonder where the statue of the monkey-san is. The mission begins at 3 a.m. Until then, we stand by. So, why is it that there are so many soldiers hanging around? Recently, ever since it has come to be known as a... world treasure, bandits have started plundering here. And so, the military has taken over patrolling it? In any case, from here on, we cannot use the truck. Here it is. H- here's what!? Here is a place out of my memories! Huh? Is that...? Grandfather, isn't this Harimao's banner? That's correct. It's the crest of Harimao's Bandits. This was Harimao's secret headquarters. I lived for three months here with Harimao and the others. It was right in the middle of World War II... My adversary was the Japanese Zero fighter. My British Spitfire fell just short of the Zeroes as far as top speed and maneuverability went. When I regained consciousness, I had... already been laid down in this room. Yes, just in front of that banner. I knew immediately that the name of... the man who had saved me was Harimao. The name of Harimao had come to be known... among the British forces, you see... Intrepid. Dauntless. Harimao and the bandits he lead were... feared not only by the British forces, but by the Japanese as well. He was indeed free and uninhibited. As if to mock the great war that was dividing the world in two, he seized gold, silver, supplies, food, ammunition, and any other conceivable thing. The Japanese, the British... he didn't care who he was taking from. Then he would share it with the poor folk... who had been adversely affected by the war. Harimao means "tiger" in Malaysian. I have never since seen another man as fascinating as he was. That's a great story! I'm quite impressed! Okay, so, isn't it about time we got to the part of the story that relates to the treasure? The good die young. And the wicked become old geezers. Listen seriously, Lupin! Fine. Unfortunately, Harimao contracted a fever. Even the great king of the jungle, enduring... so many consecutive days of high fever, must have realized that his time of death was drawing near. He handed over one statue to each of his three stewards, saying that if they were to get into a jam, they were to join their three powers together. I see, and those three statues are the bear, falcon and monkey, then. And then, the night following the next night after... I alone had been called out by Harimao. You mustn't be doing this, Harimao. What are you doing here with your fever? I must speak to you as an English gentleman, and a man of refinement, whom I can trust. Those three statues can place the... treasure we have taken into your hands. If, in the future, my three stewards come to you, I want you to tell them the secret of the statues. I will now tell the secret to you alone. Right! So, tell us the secret! The three stewards never did come before me. What about the secret? It's the same old story. They were all blinded by the treasure, and had a falling out. They came to hate each other, and then killed each other, I'm sure. What's the secret!? You've already told us everything else! How am I supposed to tell you so casually... what I've kept secret for over fifty years, even from Her Majesty? I'm going to bed! Wake me when it gets to be 3 o'clock, Jigen. How is it? It will do, I guess. I am most grateful. Look here, not drinking water! I'm asking you for hot water! Nice, steaming hot water! Sir, please accept our apologies, but at this restaurant, we cannot accept an order of just hot water. Afterwards, I was going to order some coffee as well! Only coffee, then? It's Pops... What do you mean by "only!?" This is trouble...! You may enter. Heil, Herr Maforditte! All preparations for Operation "Q" are complete. We are able to mobilize at once, at your command! Very good. I will think about promoting both of you two grades. Thank you very much, Fuhrer! You've changed the color of your rouge, I see. Y- yes... It's quite nice. Not only are you sharp-witted, but you live dangerously. Take it easy. I've come to talk business. Talk business? Driving Lord Archer into bankruptcy to force... him to go after Harimao's treasure... To that end, it was you guys who blew up the Eurotunnel, right? A military cult with 40 branches worldwide... The Neo Himmel. Who are you? You're no ordinary she-rat, are you? There is merit in teaming up with me! I know everything there is to know about Lupin and the others. Don't touch me! I-I hate girls! How cute! When I become a butterfly... da-daga-dan-dan-dan... become a butterfly, become a butterfly... become a butterf... huh? Fujiko...! The monkey statue is enshrined on the highest... floor of that temple, in the "Room of Bliss." However, the Wat Manahat Temple here is one of... the highest, first-class national treasures. There is a special guard posted here, and severe... penalties are in force against trespassers. There are sentences of twenty years or more, or if... you steal or damage the fixtures, you can get life. We're only talking about if you get caught. Well then, I wish you luck. Huh? What about you guys? We'll be standing by at the hideout from earlier. Don't you think you're asking too much? I give the orders, any you guys carry them out. I do not think there is any problem with this plan. Shall we annul our contract? Let's go, Lupin. The old guy and the woman would just slow us down anyhow. Huh? Diana! Diana! I'll be coming with you! I have a personal archaeological interest in this. I won't be any trouble. A 20-year sentence... You'll be an old woman! Hey! All right, I'll become an old man right along with you! So, Lupin, go with the usual method? Fine. Darling baby, hey, hey! Darling baby, hoy, hoy! Yo, brothers! How have things been? What is your unit!? This area is off-limits! Which unit you ask, baby? Let me have you look at this. I'm in the auspicious order of thieves! All right, now! It's started, huh? That's my Jigen-chan! Here. Move aside! Right, right, right, right...! Maybe this way is safer after all! You'll have to hold on to me even tighter! Where is this ' "Room of Bliss" thing? According to my research, it's right around here. This way! That is the Room of Bliss. Miss Diana? What? If we are to succeed, then to commemorate the two of us paired together, would you join me for some chow sometime? Is that okay? Dinner, right? I'll think about it. Goemon! What are you doing in a place like this? Meditating upon bliss and worldly desires, as well as what foolishness mankind exhibits concerning pleasure. You sure are a glutton for tribulation. I need not hear that from an ordinary man. Still, you've done pretty well to have gotten into this temple. The senior monk here has been a friend of mine for twenty years. Thanks for telling me! You could have done so sooner! I've found it, Lupin! All right! Well now, see you later, Goemon! Lupin...! Hand that monkey statue over to me! If you want it, come and get it... Don't worry about me! You want to become like a bird here at the end, don't you? There you go! You become a bird, too! He must be with those looters! Arrest him! Arrest him! You're under arrest! You're under arrest! There aren't too many common men who have... their own personal submarines, are there? I am no common man. This, you see, was something I... received especially from Her Majesty. Er, care for some coffee? Thanks. Leave it there. So, where is it we're headed to? What does Grandfather say? Well, about that, he hasn't told us a thing! Well, I'm not saying either. I deserve something. I risked my life... in order to recover the monkey statue. I risked my own life as well. That's Shakespeare, right? Baudelaire. My Fuhrer, we have new information! An old British Navy T-class submarine has just passed through coordinates 6° north latitude, 93° degrees east longitude. Continue to monitor them! Heil, Herr Maforditte! I knew it! It's the Ricobal Islands that they're headed for! You're sure in a good mood. Of course I am! An estimated $800 billion... treasure is all but within my grasp! Incidentally, would you care to hire a capable part-timer? Part-timer? Of all things, he was driven out of a temple... while he was there practicing ascetics. He took the blame for several acquaintances of... his who caused a disturbance at the temple. Let's see, what about ұ1030 an hour, with tax? What!? You're not content with that? That's right. Since it's quite possible there will be overseas... trips involved, we might be able to pay up to ұ1540. Do you know of an underground temple? A temple, dedicated to the ancient Buddhist deity Indra. It is the only god that Harimao believed in. From one of the esoteric Buddhist religions that flourished until around the 16th century, then died out. The bear, the falcon, and the monkey. It is said that these three are the patron guardians of this temple. And so, as Harimao had told me... The bear statue opens the first doorway. And then, the second doorway is opened by the falcon statue. So that's it! And then, with the monkey statue, he told you to please open this treasure chest here, right? No. Harimao said to offer the monkey to the Lake of God. The Lake of God? There are still more stairs! It's the Lake of God, old-timer. There's something... Look! There's something glowing over in that area! There's something there! Direct the right arm of the monkey toward Heaven, and throw it into the Lake of God! Throw it into the Lake of God! Here it comes! Unbelievable! It's a solid-gold submarine! Look at this! The inside of it is lined with platinum! Incredible! There's enough here that you could by a country or two, let alone the Eurotunnel! Calling all units! Commence Operation Q! It really does run! Any way you look at it, Harimao was on a level way above your queen! They're coming, huh? Here they come! Start submerging! As soon as you can! Hey, Lupin! We've got a really stubborn one here. Hey, Pops! You're gonna die! Dammit! Do you read me, Lord Archer? You have already fallen into our hands! If you hand over the treasure, we will allow you to live. Your only options are a meaningful defeat, or a pointless death. You fool! You really expect us to be... afraid of your threats and stand down!? No good? Lupin, is it? Yeah! You'd be better off minding yourself. Unfortunately, that wouldn't be appropriate! We are holding two of your pals hostage. What!? That's pretty good, Russell. That was dirty, you rat! Exactly who is it that is paying me my wages? What are you talking about, at a time like this!? I'll pay you later! Resume fire! That's done it! The air tank has been hit! We're going up! If we continue like this, we'll be crushed by the water pressure! Here they come! Incredible! How... lovely it is! I want it! Heil, Herr Maforditte! It is fate... That such a beautiful thing should become mine is the fate that providence has bestowed upon me! Very well! We will hand over this ship to you! "Thou shalt expel the female from paradise!" Why, you...! Russell, we get it, already! How did 007-san find his way through at a time like this? Let's see. First, you wait calmly until your chance comes along. That chance will never come. That voice! That's right! This is actually Russell-san, from Lloyd' Insurance! Indeed! It's a terrible thing for you... to have belittled the young miss! Our chance! Out of the way! You bastard! Grandfather! Lord Archer! Grandfather? Get off the ship! This boat is about to sink! Hold on, hold on, if I'm right... That's it! He's the cult maniac on our wanted list! You're under arrest, Lupin! You don't mean Lupin, right Pops? My fault, my fault! Okay, Grandfather, let's us go too! I will remain here. I am the only one who is able to... protect Harimao's treasure after all! You've got to be joking, old-timer! You're taking seven, I'm taking three! Lupin, some time, I wish I could have... played chess with you... Let's go, Lupin! Let's get going, Lupin! Come on, Lupin. Check... mate! Grandfather!! Now listen, you have the right to remain silent. However, if you'd like to possibly get paroled, spill everything you've got like a big boy. That will let me dispose of your case quickly, as I have to hurry and take off after Lupin! Have some ramen? Don't want any! I hate to bring it up at a time like this, but that promise... you made to get some chow with me is still on, right? Can't you call it dinner? Sure.
