(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) WOMAN: Once in our lives, we tried reaching for the stars. Dreamt of the impossible and failed. But this place makes the impossible, possible. Dubai. This place is a paradise for the people who dream. Just like me! All the best things in life are here. Everything! And everything is within your reach. I even reached them myself. This is just me. The things I thought I could never have are now mine. Here, I was never deprived of chances. MAN: Jobs, connections, money, people. Some really reached their dreams. While others are just pretending. Someone once asked me what's my dream. I think the right question is where will your dream take you. Me? It led me here. I hope Dubai makes my dream come true. I hope it leads me to you. (UPBEAT MUSIC CONTINUES) I hope to see her again. (COIN CLINKS) (MUSIC SWELLS) - Hey! - Yes! - (CHUCKLES) - You look good! - JS Prom? - Does it suit me? I just came from a side job, didn't get a chance to change. Stop explaining, I know you're feeling the suit. Come on, we're running late for work. I know, it's my last day today. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) You're such a show-off, this is why I got laid off. Come on! You should treat me for my last day, you're staying. Don't worry, I'm sure you'll find another job in no time. Just keep applying. No one ever replies. Jhim is offering me a job. I'm really considering it. Don't be stupid. Don't work for him, it's too risky. MAN: It's really hard when you're in between jobs here. (SOFT GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING) MAN: Come on, give me something for my last day! MAN: Treat me since you're staying, don't be… Hey! I've been talking to you. What's distracting you? Here, serve it to table four. MAN: This is the last time we'll be going home together. When I'm gone, you'll be by yourself. Sir, I'll go ahead. It's nice working here with you. Yeah. Thanks, kabayan. Thank you. - Is this really goodbye? - Well… Are you heading straight back to the Philippines? Or are you going to find something else here? MAN: Calm down! (WOMAN SCREAMING) I will not calm down! Where is she? MAN: Calm down! You're making a scene out of nothing! Calm down! Stop! WOMAN: I'm not going to stop until I see her! - Excuse me, guys. - WOMAN: Where is she? When I see her, I swear to God, I'm going to have her deported. - What happened? - WOMAN: She will rot in hell! - MANAGER: Please keep it down. - WOMAN: I'm not going to keep it down. MANAGER: You need to keep it down or I'm going to call the police. (PANTING) (UPBEAT INSTRUMENTAL PLAYING) Leon! Hey! Leon! Sorry! Angel? Angel! MAN: Whoa! Angel? Angel! ("ZEBBIANA" BY SKUSTA CLEE PLAYING) (RADIO PLAYING IN BACKGROUND) LEON: I don't even know what's in you. I just know that night, you woke something inside of me. And then I just realized that, shit. It's been a while since I dreamt of something. It feels good to have a dream that you want to happen. A dream that you want to have in life. And that's you, Angel. You are my dream. Good evening, ma'am. Table for? I'm just looking for someone. Ma'am, you're with someone? Babe! ANGEL: I didn't know you were back from Singapore! Since when? - Waiter, my bill. - Okay, sir. Stop. He's not going anywhere. - I am asking you. When did you come back? - Don't make a scene here. Make a scene? Why? What do you want me to do? Celebrate? Throw a welcome home party for you? Why? - You're a jackass! - Hold her! This is why I've been sending you messages and you never replied. Because you're already here! I've been working hard as a promo girl to follow you there! Then this? You're back and I didn't know? - Are you cheating? - Not here. Don't touch me! Do you have another woman? Tell me! You have another woman? - Tell me the truth! - WOMAN: Babe? Babe? Is that Angel? Maybe we should talk to her? Ma'am, please stop. Don't make a scene here. Don't ruin a family. I'm not a mistress! I'm the girlfriend! I am the girlfriend, but he's having a child with someone else! - Wow! You're so cool! - LEON: Ma'am! - You're good at taking care... - Ah! - WOMAN: Ah! - MAN: What happened? - Babe, my water just broke. - (FLUID DRIPPING) I'm about to give birth! MAN: I'm going to be a father! - Don't panic! - (GROANING) - Relax! Babe! - What should I do? Run to the hospital! - Take her to the hospital! - Hospital! - Your wife! - My wife! - LEON: I'll handle this. - ANGEL: Let's help them. - Let me. To the car! - What? - LEON: Which car? - Here you go. - Get in. - Almost there. - Where? - Careful. (WOMAN GROANS) LEON: Careful now. - Shouting is not helpful. - Get in. - Slow down. - ANGEL: Calm down. Careful. - Here. - MAN: I'm going to be a father. - Take care. - LEON: Careful. - Help in the back… - LEON: Sir, go! - I'm going to be a father. - LEON: Sir! Here. Sir, go! MAN: I'm going to be a father! Everything's okay. (SOMBER PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) Ma'am, are you okay? (LIGHT SWITCH CLICKS) (GROANS) (SNIFFLES) Come on! I told you, let's drink! (SOBS) I'm so stupid! Angel Dela Cerna. You are stupid! A fool! Angel Dela Cerna. Leon. (CHUCKLES) (DRUNKENLY) I wish I were as brave as your name. Lion. Rawr! (CHUCKLES) Have a seat. Here. Thank you, ma'am. (GULPS) (EXHALES) You know what, ma'am, you were so brave back there. You were hurt and yet you still gave way. (SCOFFS) How about you rub it in? I'm sorry. You know… I only have a simple dream. To love and to be loved back. Have a family… But why is it so damn hard? Oh, well… Look at me. Who in their right mind would want to marry me? Me. (COUGHS) Damn you! ANGEL: The hell? You're ready? You really have a ring? Hmm! If I give this to you, will you stop crying? (GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING) Angel Dela Cerna… I'll be your BF. Will you be my GF? Why, are you rich? No. For now, this is the only thing I can offer. Okay, fine! Yes! - Yes? - Yes. - We're official? - I said, yes! Oh, you're my GF now! (BOTH CHUCKLING) Yes? LEON: Angel… An angel who came down from heaven. You're like a recurring dream. Always coming back, but also always leaving. I can only dream of you, but can never have you. (STRINGS PLAYING) GF! BF! It's you! You look so different! ANGEL: Come on, let's go! I need more exercise. Wait, I think this is yours. - Yes, but… - Wear it. - No, no. - Come on, wear it. You might hurt your feet walking barefoot around here. (GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING) (MAN MUTTERING) Yes! Yes! Yes! I will marry you! Of course! Super! I will marry the one and only you! Yes, thank you, Lord! Thank you! Angel… Yes! Wow! MAN: Congratulations! I thought you were single! You didn't even mention this girlfriend you have. Hi, I'm… I'm Juniver. Your best man. - Angel. - Angel, I've never seen you. - ANGEL: Huh. - Angel? What is it this time? Why? You proposed, so I said yes! (NERVOUS CHUCKLE) Yay, you're my fiancé now! Woo-hoo! What proposal? What does this mean? You're that foreigner's mistress? Is that why his wife was mad? Hey! You're so judgmental! Watch your mouth. Let's go eat somewhere else. I think you have a lot of questions for me. JUNIVER: Perfect! I'm really hungry. You're not coming. Let's go, Leon. - JUNIVER: Wait. Come on! - LEON: Where are we going? We'll just eat! Takeout food for me! ANGEL: Well, it's important to be with good people here. You will be successful in no time! You know, connections! You need to start from the bottom. When I was starting, I was a receptionist. Then I became an executive assistant. Of course, my boss was really impressed with me. I gave it my all, so he invested in me. Ma'am… why did you leave without a word? I looked for you. I messaged you on Facebook, you never replied. My life was a mess at that time. I couldn't think straight. You know, I was broken. But joking aside, what we had was special to me. I was so sad that night. But because of you, I became happy. Thank you. Here. I never planned to steal this from you. I just didn't know how to return it and face you. Okay, what's your next question? I'm sure you're so eager to know why that woman made a scene. Was it because of me? ANGEL: Am I a mistress? Well, Mr. Boy, first, I just want to apologize to you. I'm sorry if I dragged you into this. But technically, I'm not his mistress. They've broken up, but that woman is still in denial. The divorce is still pushing through, so I can be a legal wife! Yuck! You're with that old man? Does he even love you? (SCOFFS) Love? Does it matter? What matters is that I am expensive now. Enough about me. Let's talk about you. How are you? How long have you been here in Dubai? It seems like you're really doing good here! Look at you in a tuxedo! Does it suit me? Of course. This is not mine. I just borrowed it from my friend. I do side jobs in events. Well, sometimes. But I'm a waiter here. I've just been here for six months. In fairness, you're consistent! Of course, I need to work hard. To save money. If it's just really me, I'm already settled in the province. Simple life. Peaceful. - It's for my dad, that's why I'm here. - Oh, come on! Stop with the simple life dreams, Leon! You're now here in Dubai! You can dream bigger! Stop being in survival mode! Tell me, what really is your dream? The thing that you really, really want. I want to… have a quiet and simple family. And I want to have a restaurant, I'm really into cooking. That's great! You can do that here! I know someone who was a cook in a small-time restaurant here in Dubai. But now, he's a chef in Atlantis! That's Atlantis! You just have to work hard, be patient. Look at me! Who would've thought? CEO! ANGEL: See? I'll give you my card. In case you need anything, just call me. I have Filipino business partners. Tita Faye, she used to work in advertising back in Manila. She's the brains of the company because I lack in that department. What if you are what I need? Oh, please. Not me. I'm already taken. But if you were not taken, would I have a chance? Leon, it was just one night. Move on already. It was not just one night. LEON: To me, it was more than that. (SOFT GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING) - (INDISTINCT CHATTER) - MAN 1: Let's drink! No, I can't drink. I asked for a salary advance last week. MAN 2: There might be nothing left of my salary. MAN 2: You know what? I could work in a call center so I would have double income. I don't want advance payment until I'm broke again. MAN 3: Sir, stop! Hey! Leon! Let's go! We're running late! I know there's a reason why we saw each other again. JUNIVER: Big round of applause for Leon! (CHEERING) Congratulations! I'm so happy for you, Leon! (LAUGHS) This is why you don't want to try Tinder. You could've just told me! That's nothing! This is your fault! - (LAUGHING) - You're so gossipy. Imagine! After three years, you saw each other again, despite how big Dubai is? Oh, my God! If it's meant to be, it's really meant to be! (LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY) So? When is the wedding? I heard there's a ring! What wedding? It's complicated! Wow! Complicated! - Don't play with us. - Ker, thank you for this. We're not teenagers anymore! I hear wedding bells! (LAUGHS) Wedding bells? - JUNIVER: So what happened? - Nothing! I get all fussy. This is so romantic! This is destiny! (LAUGHS) I hope everyone acts the same way. Getting a ring. I'm just fixing some issues. Come on, let's go. You're not coming? No, no. I'm okay. - Are you sure? - Yes. Jhim never learns. People are getting caught. Bro. Here. The answer to your problem. "Angel Flores Dela Cerna?" "Owner, CEO Deluxe Events"? Don't worry, I'll apply with you. Nice one! Thank you, bro. Thank you! This is really the answer! You're going to see her again! - Control your woman. - I'm so excited! (DOOR LOCK BEEPS) (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) - Where have you been? - Papang! I've been trying to call you. - It's late! - No, uh… Look! Look! My phone, it's dead! Died. No more battery. It's killed! - Here, do you see? - Next time, don't let it die. Yes, of course. No. Where have you been? Who is that guy who's proposing to you, huh? He's acting. We're acting. To, you know, the problem, to escape it. He's just a Filipino helping a fellow Filipino. No, no serious. Do you want tea? I'll make you tea! No! No! - I'll give you a massage, come on. - No. It's okay! It's okay! (SIGHS) (IN SPANISH) My love. It's just that I got so jealous with your Filipino. - No, no, don't be. - Just a little bit. Don't be jealous. He's nothing. - No one. - Make sure, okay? Yes. I don't know what I can do if I catch you with another man, huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah. - (CELL PHONE RINGS) - Oh! (IN SPANISH) Yes. (IN SPANGLISH) I am coming now! Yes. I must go home. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Babe! Leon! Hurry up! I'm so excited to meet her! This is it! Destiny reporting, live! Hey, it's too early for your noisy girlfriend. What are you wearing? It looks cheap! Try to be cool! What's the problem with my clothes? And we're not going to ask for her hand, we're going to ask for a job! Why are you even coming? Well, of course, I want a side job too! (SNIFFS) You smell like the streets! Here, so you smell tastier! There! Smells good! - Now she will fall in love. - You're out of your mind! (CELL PHONE RINGS) - Hello, Dad? - Hello? We're running late. - Hello? - Yes? We're leaving now to apply for a job. Wait, son, I'll call them. Allen! James! - Dad! - Come on! Claudine! Claudine! Red! LEON'S DAD: Where are you headed? We're going to apply for a job. Bro, we got your package. Thank you so much for the shoes! It really fits me well! Bro, thanks for the watch and bag. Looks so good! Dad, here are Juniver and Cat! - Hello, Dad! - Hi, Dad! How are you? Hello, lovebirds! It seems like Cat is losing weight! Of course, as thin as paper! Okay, Dad. Dad, we have to go. We're running late and our bus is almost here. LEON'S DAD: Okay, son, be safe there. Yes, Dad. Take care too. I love you! - Bye, Dad! - Bye, Dad! Bye! It was just a one-night stand anyway! So why do you have to give him a job? And his friends are joining too? Tita, I'll just help him because I owe him one. And they will be a big help to us. It's like serendipity. You're really bound to meet again. Stop feeding her nonsense! You know how mad Enrique can get, right? What then? Everything that you have now? Goodbye! Goodbye, Deluxe Events! Goodbye, Ferrari! Goodbye to your house and lots in the Philippines! BOTH: Goodbye, Dubai! - How much? - Best price, sir! Bro, did you forget me? I came here last month and bought everything! Yeah, how many pieces, sir? Forty-five for ten pieces. No problem. I'll give you this price. - Okay, ten pieces. - Okay. - Boss, ten pieces. Thank you. - Welcome. Ma'am Angel, done deal. Excuse me, I have to go now. I need to buy things for my mom. Wait, you're going alone? Why don't you bring Leon with you? His haggling skills might help you get discounts. Leon! - Ma'am? - WOMAN: Go with Ma'am Angel. She's going shopping. Sure, ma'am. I'll go with you after I finish this. (CELL PHONE RINGS) Hello, Auntie? Wait, Patrick wants to talk to you. Sis? I have good news for you! I'm accepted in La Salle! Wow! I'm going to have an engineer in the future! But, sis, you promised you'd get me a condo near the university. Yes, that's why you should start finding one. That's what I'm talking about! You are really the best! Have you seen the new Yeezy? - Yeah, okay, I'll try to find one here. - Hey, me too! Whatever that Yeezy might be, I want one! Of course, Auntie. Yes. Wait, here's your mom. - Hello? - Yes, Mom? I'll be sending... Angel. Come home, please? For my birthday? Mom, I can't. I'm too busy here. So many things to do. But I'll be sending money to you. And actually, I am now in the gold market! ANGEL: I'll buy jewelry and I will send it to you in no time. I have to go now. Bye. - Let me have it. - Let's eat. Ma'am, it seems like they want you to come home. I can't, I'm doing a lot of things here. I'm busy. Ma'am, if I was rich and I had as much money as you, I'm sure I'd always be home. Unpractical. I'll just send the money. Ma'am, it's still different when you go home. Amidst the chaos and noise, it's still a happy place compared to here where your work is your life. Not really. Maybe you have a happy family, that's why you want to be home. You're lucky because you are one of the few with a happy family. What's trending now is having a toxic family. That's why ours is always at the top. Well, it's always been that way. My mom got pregnant early and got stood up. Then she got pregnant again and got stood up again. So, she got into drugs, where she found her true love. She only stopped because she had a stroke. I am literally a teenage mom. I did everything to raise my family. There were times I ran short of money for tuition fees. There were times I had to bail my mom out of jail because of drugs. So, I had to find ways to survive. That's why this life that I have now… I'm totally fine with it. There are moments that I need to look away to endure, but at least I'm done worrying about money. Bye! - Hi, Ma'am Angel! - Ruth! Do you have new collections? FAYE: Be careful with the balloons. - LEON: Yes, I'll handle it. - It might fall and fly over. Angel is coming. Really? okay, okay. Cat! - Give me your perfume! - Oh! Here! - JUNIVER: Bathe with it! - Gargle it! There you go! - Yummy! Whoo! - I'm ready. - Sir Enrique! Hello, welcome! - Hello, thank you very much. - Let's go! - All right, let's go. Have some cocktails, enjoy yourself. ENRIQUE: We are going to enjoy ourselves, okay? FAYE: Yes, yes. ENRIQUE: There we are, thank you. - Ah, shoes, I suppose, huh? - Yes. Oh, Papang, this is Leon. You remember the Filipino who helped me? The… You remember? Thank you for helping my girlfriend, huh? - No, sir. - Is it not enough? No, you take it. - ANGEL: He's just the shy type. - LEON: No, sir. I didn't do it for the money. It's okay. Well, okay. For the job, eh? (CHUCKLES) Remove your shoes! (UPBEAT INSTRUMENTAL PLAYS) I am going back to Spain tomorrow, huh? I will finally settle things with my wife. Finally! You know, that looks really soothing, man. You're one lucky guy, Enrique. I am, I am. I think I'll get myself one of these Filipinas. Yeah. They, uh… They take good care of people. And they look real beautiful. Look at her, she's beautiful. (MEN CHUCKLING) Welcome, everybody! Welcome aboard! And now, I present to you our host, Harry! (CHEERING) - Thank you, thank you! - It's your turn! Thank you so much, thank you. Guys! Thank you so much for coming to my divorce party. (CHEERING) Look at me, I'm really free! But it wouldn't have been possible without you, Angel. - Uh, no. - Come! - No, no, no. - Come, Angel. Come on. Come on. I want you to make a toast. - Uh, no need. - Yes, yes. Because now I'm free, and soon you're going to be chained to my friend here, Enrique. So, have you got any final words, last words? Uh, congratulations! Uh, you are now single, you will be now single, and ready to mingle! - (ALL CHEERING) - ANGEL: To happiness! - (GLASSES CLINK) - Cheers! - Appreciate it. Thank you. - Ooh. FAYE: Enjoy yourselves! There's more drinks and there's food downstairs. (IN SPANGLISH) What was that? You sounded stupid! Everyone was looking at me! - Leon, don't. - ANGEL: I'm sorry. Don't talk to my friends again, okay? You know your place. You are mine. - Mine! - Yes. I told you, I don't like other men meddling in my business! It's very aching, please stop. - It's aching me. - Sir, sir. Don't fight at her. She's pain! Don't shout at her! Who are you, huh? You are nothing more than a server here. You have no right to speak to me this way! - But, sir… - Hey, hey, hey, stop. Come on, come on. Hey, Enrique. Come on, let's go up. Come on, you party, you have fun! You drink! You drink some more, please? Please? I will handle him! What was that? Why are you prying? He was hurting you, I can't just look away! That's none of your business! He's doing that because he loves me! He's just jealous! Love? (SCOFFS) He doesn't even respect you, how is that love? You shouldn't care! - But I do! - You shouldn't! That's not a part of your job! Angel, what happened to you? You were so brave before, now you just let him disrespect you? I know what I'm doing, I'm not stupid. I know what I give, and I know what I'm getting in return. - Okay? Money. - What is it? A good life for my family. Respect from the people who used to belittle me. - Respect? Respect for you? - Yes! For you or for your money? You know what, Leon? If you want to be poor all your life, then so be it! I'll even be happy for you. But you don't get to judge me if I want to be rich. Ma'am, I may be poor, but I will never sell myself to anyone. You know what's wrong with you? You don't even know what true love means because all you care about is money. So what? I'm happy! I'm rich! I can buy whatever I want! But you can never buy love! Who even told you that I want love? Who are you to judge my choices in life? Who do you think you are? What are you to me? Nothing. You are just my employee. I am paying you to work for me. I am your boss, so you should know your place. You cannot go beyond that. Money. What we need is money. Ma'am, money can be earned, it can be worked hard for. But love rarely happens. Money will never hurt you, will never leave you for someone else. Because when money becomes yours, then it's just yours. (SIGHS) But you can't marry money. Money can buy happiness. Money can't buy love. You're really not backing down, huh? A man who's willing to fight for love. Wow. (CHUCKLES) LEON'S DAD: Son? Son? You froze? Dad, I'm still here. Son, you look really tired. Go get some rest. (SIGHS) okay. Take care. (INHALES, EXHALES DEEPLY) (DELICATE MUSIC PLAYING) FOR THE THINGS I'VE SAID - Uh… Ma'am, I'm done. - Okay. Sorry. Take it. Thank you. I'll go ahead. Thank you. (EXHALES) - (SCREAMS, GROANS) - Ma'am Angel! I told you to set aside your feelings, what a waste of a job! LEON: Don't worry. I'm sure I'll find another job. So sad. - Are you resigning? - (CELL PHONE CHIMES) Such a waste. I hoped your story with Ma'am Angel would have a happy ending. I really thought it was destiny. Let it go. If that's what she wants with her life, then so be it. I got a text from Ma'am Faye. - Oh, no. Ma'am Angel got into an accident. - Huh? I need to go, she gave me her door passcode so I can get the documents she needs to sign. She said she can't even walk. Poor Ma'am Angel, she even lives alone. What did she say? Is she okay? Where is she now? I just told you to set aside your feelings! (CHUCKLES) You know what I think? The story is not yet finished. - (CHUCKLES) Whatever. - (TEASES) ENRIQUE: Why? Where are you? Aren't you working? I… No, I didn't go to work. The doctor told me, uh, I have to rest my foot. It's very aching. Very aching? Okay. Um, hey, I'm alone here. I don't have food, I'm hungry. Just get food delivered to you. Anyway, I have a meeting. I have to go. Bye. Hello? Oh, come on! (SHOUTS IN FRUSTRATION) (GROANS) (DOOR LOCK BEEPING) Juniver! Is that you? - Sorry. - (DOOR CLOSES) I was not able to sign the documents. I need to read them again. Can you go back tomorrow? I'm sorry. Hey! What are you doing here? Have you eaten? I'm fine. Your kitchen? There. Why do you ask? Hey! Hey! Leon! I'm fine. What are you going to do? Are you going to cook? You don't have to. I'm not even hungry, I'll get delivery! Angel, you're so stubborn. - I told you not to stand! - I'm fine, I don't need help. I'm really fine. I don't need... (SCREAMS) - Stubborn! Don't stand up! - What's your problem? You have always been so stubborn! What's with the lifting? Stay there. Don't move, you will hurt your foot. I'll be with you until you can stand on your own again. (UPBEAT INSTRUMENTAL PLAYING) Ma'am, this will just be quick. Ma'am. Mmm. So good. (UPBEAT INSTRUMENTAL CONTINUES) Here, eat up. Why are you not eating? Do you want me to feed you? I don't feel like eating. Okay then, just get some rest. Oh, no need. ANGEL: I can handle myself! I'll go ahead. I'm so hungry! So good! (DOORBELL RINGS) - (GRUNTS) - (DOOR LOCK BEEPING) Miss Angel? I'll be in charge of you today as per Leon's request. He still has a shift at the restaurant, so… Whatever you need, I'm just here. Isn't he the sweetest? (CELL PHONE CHIMES) ALL GONE! Sir. Ma'am. I can manage. I said, I can manage. - Ma'am, let's go. - I'm fine. - Ma'am, please sit. - No need. - You'll have a hard time. - It's okay, I can do this. Ma'am. I said, I'm fine. Fine, I'll let you be. ANGEL: No, Tita, I'm already walking. Yes, wait for me, I'll be there. Okay, bye! (GROANS) Whoo! Feels good! Come on, I'll give you a ride. I'm okay. Are you sure? Okay, then. It's so fun to ride the bike. Whoo! (LEON WHISTLING) Wait! Give me a ride. Thank you. There's also a biking place in Manila. - Padyaking. - Padyaking. Ma'am, are you okay? Very much. LEON: This is fun. Holding hands while padyaking. (BOTH CHUCKLING) Do you always do that, padyaking? Whenever I don't have work at the restaurant, this is my side job. No way. Yeah. I've tried every side job you can think of. Like what? Sometimes, I work as an escort boy when I have nothing else to do, just to earn extra money. - Can I call you my boy? - Yes, ma'am! (BOTH LAUGHING) Thank you for cooking for me. And I'm sorry for the things I've said. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS) CAT: Hey! Look at Leon and Ma'am Angel, they're riding a bike together! WOMAN: Wow, VIP! I'm jealous! Let's ride a bike too, babe! As long as you'll drive. - Whatever! - Just kidding. You know what, Tita Faye, if there's no Enrique, those two really go well together, right? But there's an Enrique! You'll never be ready for me! Ah. Oh, I'll put an end to this! This is it! Ma'am Angel? (SCREAMS) Oh, my God! Oh, my good Lord! An exposed body! Where is Leon? He's not yet undressed... I mean, he's still at work. - Are you expecting him? - What? No! I'm about to get dressed, I fell asleep. - I'm always sleepy lately! - I understand. Juniver! Oh, there's Leon! Thanks, bro. okay, just take care of this. - I'll go to the office. - Take care. Why are you late? I exchanged my shift at the restaurant so I could be with you. Okay, join us in our meeting. He will join us? Look at him, he's so haggard! Dirty! FAYE: That is what we requested, right? Yes. WOMAN: Hey, is that Leon? Ma'am. Why did you stand up? My butt ate my panties. FAYE: Oh, I'm sorry! Um, so, that's the view, and this is the food. If you're happy, we can sign the contract, yes? - Yes? - CLIENT: Better. (EXHALES) Thank you. I'll go ahead. Uh... okay. (GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING) Ma'am. Yes? Why are your eyes closed? I'm sleepy. Are you expecting something else? Expecting what? - A kiss from me. - No, I'm just really sleepy. - (SIGHS) - (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) FAYE: Sir, this is the location we're suggesting and my associate, Angel, she will be presenting to you the proposal. Are you ready? Wait, I'm ready too! - Just a second, ma'am. - Okay. So, sir, we were thinking… the proposal, it will happen right here. When she walks in, you will be standing right here. There will be music and then there will be fireworks. Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Bam! And then the picture of your girlfriend will be flashed on the building. And then she will be very touched. She will say yes to you. Right? How… How you're thinking right now? Yes, extravagant. But do you think she'll appreciate that? Of course, she will! It's every girl's... every... It's my dream! How about you? You are a guy, what do you think? Ah! Sir, he's not part of the team. He's actually our driver! It's okay, I want to hear your thoughts. Uh, sir, for me, I don't like bongga. Flashy! Flashy! I like, uh, simple but meaningful. Sir, where do you meet your girlfriend? Here! It was here! I saw her in a beautiful dress. And, oh, boy, she was the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. Love at first sight? Yes! I know that, sir. It happens to me. Uh, sir. This place is very special to you. You should do it here. Come let's show him. ANGEL: Okay, we will pretend. Sir, hold your loved one's hand. You need to hold the hand of the girl you love. And then tell her… that someday… …these hands will be held and will never be let go. And all the pain and suffering... Will be gone? Will be shared. Love is not magic. The only thing it can promise is that, you'll have someone to share your troubles with. In joy and sorrow, in pain and happiness, in nothingness and richness… you will always have someone… …who will accept you, no matter what you've been through. And who will love you… even on days that you feel like you don't deserve love. That's what I want with you for the rest of my life. Will you marry me? Yes. CAT: It's so romantic! JUNIVER: The birds agree! (ROMANTIC MUSIC SOARING) I love it! I felt that real! Oh, my God, I love it! NURSE: You will be able to walk again. Everything's okay. Try to stand up. (GRUNTS) Oh! Leon, now that Angel's foot is healed, you can now finally file your resignation. (GROANS) Ouch! Ouch! - LEON: Are you okay? - She's acting. Your X-ray result is okay. Your foot is not swollen anymore. So, you should walk it out, so it can go back to how it used to be. Doesn't it need a cast? No, no need. - Does it hurt? - It hurts. - I can't even stand up, how can I reach… - (CELL PHONE RINGING) Psst. Angel, Enrique's calling. Papang? Yes, sorry. Yeah, hello! I'm sure you know this illusion has an expiration, right? So, whatever you have right now… should stop. Just like before. Why do you think she left you three years ago? - (DOG BARKING) - (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) (GENTLE MUSIC SWELLING) (CROWING) Angel? Did you see a woman? Fair-skinned? Yes, she left already. Is that your girlfriend? FAYE: I know you're not stupid. And I also know that you can't give her this kind of life. So, if you really love her… don't let all of this… be taken away from her. (SOMBER PIANO MUSIC PLAYS) From her family. Mima. (WOMAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY OVER PA) MAN: This is exactly where I first saw you. And right then and there, I knew we were meant to be, and I knew we would spend the rest of our lives together. Will you marry me? - Yes. - (CHEERING) FAYE: Congratulations! Whoo! - Give those to them! - Yes. FAYE: Take more pictures! - (SHUTTER CLICKS) - Where is Leon? He should be here because this is his concept. Ma'am, he doesn't want to work here anymore. Hey, Angel. Attend to the client. - Yes, ma'am, the client. - Yes, madam. Angel… Enrique is about to come back! This is what you need to do. Relax, chill. Get some beauty sleep! Get a Brazilian wax! Baby beaver! Right? Picture, picture, picture. Here. (BITTERSWEET PIANO MUSIC CONTINUES) (BIRDS SQUAWKING) CAT: Good morning, Leon. Still not in the mood. He's been like that since yesterday. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) - Ma'am Angel? - Hi! - CAT: God! Come in. - JUNIVER: Ma'am Angel! Guys, this is Ma'am Angel, our boss at the events company. Leon! It's Ma'am Angel! Leon! This is too much, ma'am. Those are just supplies that you can also send home. ALL: Ooh! A thank you gift for taking care of me. CAT: Aww. (OTHERS GUSHING HAPPILY) - JUNIVER: This is a lot! - (LAUGHTER) MAN: Get away from me. - Thank you, see this. - Here, bro. Leon. Hey, are you really resigning? We have another event next week. Hey. What are you doing here, Angel? Nothing, I just brought some… Can we stop playing games? I don't know. I guess I just wanted to see you. I miss you. What do you really want? I don't know, I'm confused. How about you? I really don't know. You don't know? Well, I know. I know that I love you so much. But I also know that I am not what you need. You need someone else so you can live, that's why I'm walking away from you. You don't have to walk away. Angel, if I don't stop being with you, I can never stop loving you. I know that I will just get hurt, we will just get hurt, because what we have doesn't have a future. So, please, let's just stop this. Maybe there really is a reason why we met again. I was okay before. I was okay when you were not around, but now… I don't even understand why, all of a sudden, it feels like I can't live without you anymore. Damn it. (CHUCKLES) Damn it, I love you. Shit, I love you. (AWKWARD CHUCKLE) It feels good to finally say it. - (CHUCKLES) - ("MAHALIN" BY TRISHA DENISE PLAYING) Leon, are you sure? I'm not easy to love. Your life will never be the same again. If we choose each other, we need to fight for it because I'm sure that Enrique won't make this easy for us. Can you do it? Can you really love me? Because I'm ready to jump if you tell me you're doing this with me. CAT: Hello! Welcome! Come and enjoy! Ma'am, sir! Hi! Welcome! ("MAHALIN" CONTINUES PLAYING) WOMAN: Hello! Welcome. (SCREAMING) - (SCREAMS) - (LAUGHS) ("MAHALIN" INSTRUMENTAL PLAYING) Is everything okay? ("MAHALIN" CONTINUES PLAYING) (CHEERING, APPLAUDING) (CHEERING, APPLAUDING) ("MAHALIN" CONTINUES PLAYING) I love you. ("MAHALIN" CONTINUES PLAYING) (SONG ENDS) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING) (AUDIENCE CLAPPING) WOMAN: Thank you for this award. You know, being recognized as an outstanding Filipina, is just the cherry on top. Filipinos in Dubai are changing. We are now respected and recognized. We are now achievers who work hard for our dreams. But one thing will never change. We should not forget where we came from. Awards like this feel good, but this is meaningless… …if you don't have someone to share it with. People often ask me, how did I make it? What is my story? HR director, awards, glitz, glamour, success. But I'm telling you, the moment I step inside my house… FAYE: Psst. WOMAN: …it all goes away. I am a mother… - Let me handle this. - WOMAN: A wife, a daughter. I am still the same farm girl from La Union. - Enrique. - (WOMAN CONTINUES SPEECH) I remember him… from the yacht. I thought I told you to fire him. Can I explain? - I'll talk to him. - (AUDIENCE CLAPPING) No, no, no. Please. (ENRIQUE MUTTERS) (ANGEL SOBBING) Who is that man? Are you fucking him? It's not like that. - (GRUNTS) - (GROANS) (SOBBING) - Do you think I'm stupid? - No. You're going behind my back with someone like that? Sorry. (SOBBING) I'm sorry. My divorce is final. I can marry you now. How dare you! (GROANS) You can't do this to me, Angel! This is all you've ever wanted. I love him. Please let me go. Please. You will never be anything without me. You will never be happy! Get out! Get out! FAYE: I warned you! I told you! My God, Angel! You are so selfish! Did you even think about your family? About us? Your employees? How about our families? We are all depending on this company! Tita, we will go through this together. We will help each other. How? You owe Enrique AED 500,000! You're massively in debt! 6.5 million pesos? Where in the world will you get that? Angel and I will work on it together. I will never leave her. And from here on, I will share all her burdens. What are you, teenagers? You're too old for this! You know Enrique very well, Angel. You know the price of this foolishness! (SOFT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) - Angel, where should I put this? - Put it here on the side. - Love? - LEON: GF? - ANGEL: BF! - GF! Look, I bought you something. It's cheap, but I hope you'll like it. This is too much! I was thinking you could wear it. It's so nice! I can really wear it. (SMOOCHES) - That feels great. - Thank you! I will wear this on my online selling gig. I will sell bags. There they are. What do you think? - I'll get big commissions from that. - That's a lot. GF, I have another surprise for you. Take a look. Read it. What is this? My loan got approved! AED 15,000! Wow! (LEON CHUCKLES) - And not just that. - What else? I talked to my boss about me wanting to be a chef. He said he'll refer me if he finds any opening. Someday, we will be able to finally go home for good. We will start your dream of having a restaurant. Simple life, simple family. - Simple dreams for the two of us. - Mm-hmm. (BOTH CHUCKLING) Hey, Leon, I need to speak with you for a minute. Can you please follow me? (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) ANGEL: Just comment "mine," sis! First to comment will get this item. There you go… Who is this? Maki De Vera is the first commenter! Sis, take a screenshot! One, two, three, four. Four, three, two, one. Tugs, tugs, tugs, tugs! Okay! Thank you all very much! That's it for tonight, until next time! Thank you, miners! Bye! (LAPTOP CHIMES) What is this? You went to the police station? Yes. I got a call about Enrique. He is filing a case against me. This is about the events company. It's because we were business partners and I just left without any settlement. So, now, I'm banned from employment until I pay the fine. How much is it? AED 50,000. Um, I need to settle it in three months. The rest of the debt, I will just pay gradually. He'll decide if he wants to settle it in court. Or just have a private settlement. Well, that's just how it is. We've expected this anyway, right? I'm sure Enrique is not stopping anytime soon, but it's okay. We'll fight for this. Leon. Hey. Are you okay? I just lost my job, Angel. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) That's fine. You can find another one. GF. What if we just go home to the Philippines? Maybe our luck is not here in Dubai. What's there for us back home? It's harder to earn money there. And I have a travel ban. I cannot travel back home. You know what, you will get another job. And I will settle all my debts. Trust me. We will get through this. Okay. If that's what you want. We can do this. (EXHALES DEEPLY) (BITTERSWEET MUSIC PLAYING) Dad, I'm sorry. I had problems in remitting money. But don't worry, I will send it right away. Should you need more, I will find another way. This will get us through, son. It's okay. What's important is that you're safe there. Don't worry about me, Dad. I am very much okay here. Okay. Get some rest. Okay, take care too. Bro, there's an easy way to solve your problems. I have a big transaction coming. Easy-peasy, give the cargo and then take the money. Only one big pour of courage is what it'll take to fix your lives. Yes, I know it's scary because this is not our country, but this is what we need. For the likes of us, we only have two choices. Either you suffer or you take action. Think about it. Maybe I need to tell Patrick that he can't go to La Salle anymore. I can't afford it anymore. (COINS CLINKING) Leon, what if… What if I talk to Enrique? Ask him to settle this, I just need to try. You know, maybe he considers... No. The two of us will raise money together to pay your debt. (DOOR OPENS) - JUNIVER: Babe. - Leave me alone, asshole! - Babe… - Don't touch me or I'll hurt you! Just hear me out, please. - Babe, hey! - Stop! We're done! So that's why you don't have Facebook! I should've asked for a CENOMAR! I trusted you too much! Babe, I didn't think that… What? That you'll get caught? That you have a wife and children back in the Philippines! That you made me a mistress! - I've been honest to you! Asshole! - Sorry. - Did you know of this? - CAT: Asshole. JUNIVER: I have a plan. Do what's right, Juniver. Go home and fix this mess you made! I don't want to see your face ever again. - Leave! - Babe, wait. Babe! Bro. Why did you do that? I didn't… I didn't plan this. I didn't plan to hurt anybody, I didn't plan to cheat on anyone. I came here to Dubai for my family. But I never expected that being alone here would be this sad. You work your ass off, day and night, just so you can send money back home. I started questioning if this was all there was for me. Is this really going to be my life? A cash cow? Then I met Cat. I found happiness again. But she's right, I need to fix this mess. I need to fix it. Damn it! But even if I want to start over, I don't know how. I don't have money. I'll go home without anything. (SOBBING) I don't even have savings. What about the people depending on me? How can we survive? I can't just let them suffer, bro. I am a father. Goddamn... It's so expensive to love, damn it. (PENSIVE MUSIC PLAYING) - Hey, kabayan, how are you? Come in. - No. Thank you. Ruth! Hey, Ma'am Angel. How've you been? - I'm good. Um… - Come in. No, no, it's fine. I just need to try because… WOMAN: What happened? Why? Maybe I can sell these to you? Maybe you can help me? Ma'am, we don't usually buy old gold. Maybe you can just try because I bought most of these from you. - And I am a loyal customer, right? - Yes, ma'am, I know that. Okay, ma'am, let me just check. - Give me a minute. - Bring these too. Okay, ma'am, wait for me, I'll be back. Thank you, miners! - LEON: Okay, sir. - Thank you, bye! I will go to the interview next week. Yes, sir! - Okay! - (CELL PHONE RINGS) I'll write down. Hello? Angel! Your mother! She had a heart attack! What? We already called an ambulance! Patrick! Get my bag! Damn it, Patrick! My bag! What are you doing? Get the keys! We're heading to the hospital, send money right away! Yes! Yes! - Hello? Hello? - Annette, what the... Don't die! (PHONE BEEPING) Angel, why? What happened? - (LAUGHS) - Why? What happened? Angel? (LAUGHING) Damn it. What's this? (SOBBING) What is this? Is this a prank? Are we in a soap opera? Why? Damn it, what else? What else? What else? What else? (SOBS) I need to go home, I need to go home! - Angel. - Where is my stuff? Calm down. I need to go home to the Philippines! My mom is dying! She needs me. My mom needs me, she's been asking me to come home. I should've gone home! (CRYING) Leon, I don't know what to do, please help me. We need money, please help me. Help me, Leon. My mom… My mom! (SOBS) Are you sure about this? Yes, bro. Angel needs help badly. She needs the money for her mom's medication. She needs to go home. Jhim. Yes, Auntie. I already sent money. Yes, okay. Leon. - Pack your things, bring everything. - Why? We're going home. How? It doesn't matter. I found a way. What's important now is, you pack your things. I'll pick you up later. Okay. JHIM: Let's go? Are you really not going? Damn it, I'm nervous. You can do this. Just call me when you get the money. Go, go, go. Hey, how about you work on your first day? - Start working. - Sorry. (BICYCLE BELL RINGS) Hey, what happened? Where are you going? I'm going home. - Leon and I are going home. - Huh? How? How about your debt? He found a way. He got a loan. What way? I saw him and Juniver talking to Jhim. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) I think they're here. Be safe. - (KEYPAD BEEPING) - (CLEARS THROAT) (MUSIC INTENSIFIES) OPERATOR: The number you're trying to reach is unavailable. Damn it, Leon! Answer the phone! The number you're trying to reach… - Let's go to Jhim! Come on! - Let's go! - JHIM: Just relax. - ANGEL: Jhim! Jhim! What did you ask Leon and Juniver to do? Easy! They're on their way. What do you mean? What if something happened to them? Why is it my fault? Is it me who wants to go home? Am I the one in debt? I'm just helping! Leon is doing this for you! What they're going to do is simple. (KEYPAD BEEPING) (CELL PHONE RINGING) Oh, here they are! Hello? Hello, Jhim. Leon, don't do this. Listen to me, please. You don't have to do this. Angel, I told you I will do anything for you. This is the answer to your problem. No, please. Please come back. That is not important anymore, just come back! (POLICE SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE) MAN 1: Let's go! MAN 2: Run! Run! (POLICE SIREN CONTINUES) Leon? Leon, what's happening? What's happening? Answer me! What's that? Hello? Hello? Damn it! Jhim, we're coming with you! Don't follow me if you don't want to get involved! (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC CONTINUES) (MUSIC INTENSIFIES) - Juniver! - Juniver! Juniver! Juniver, where's Leon? I don't know, I'm sorry. He's still there. What do you mean? You were together! Yes, the police arrived, I was scared, I panicked. I'm sorry, please tell Leon when you see him that I'm sorry. You were scared? Juniver, what were you thinking? That's Leon! JUNIVER: I didn't know what to do, Cat! I didn't know! Please not now, just let me be! CAT: You're an asshole! So, that's just it? JUNIVER: Please, not now. I'll just call you! (PENSIVE MUSIC PLAYING) (PANTING, SOBBING) (POLICE SIREN WAILING) (WHACK) (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC STOPS) Okay, this looks all right. Sort it out. - ENRIQUE: Fix it. - RECEPTIONIST: Just sign here. ENRIQUE: I'm running out of time now. Let's just fix this old thing, all right? - Will do that immediately. - Enough now. - Okay? Later. - Yes, sir. What are you doing here? Sir… Angel needs your help. Please help her. How dare you come here and ask for my help? Sir, her mother is in the hospital. She needs money. She needs to go home to the Philippines. Sir, I'm begging you. Sir, remove the case. Sir, please. Sir, please help her. No! That woman betrayed me! Both of you! You played me! You made me look like a fool! Sir. I'm begging you. Sir, please help her. Sir, I'm willing to do everything. Just help her, please. I'm begging you, sir. Please help us, sir. (SOBBING) Sir. Please, sir. Please have mercy. Please help Angel, sir. Sir, she needs your help. Please, I'm begging you, sir. (GRUNTING) All the money, all the jewelry, all the expensive things I have given to her are waiting for her in my room. Give her back to me. You don't deserve her! You are nothing!

BODYGUARD: Come here! LEON: Sir, sir, sir! ENRIQUE: Come on! Get him! Sir! Sir! I'm sorry, sir! Sir, please forgive me, sir! - LEON: Sorry! - Give it to him! Sir! Sir Enrique! Take him! Sir, please! Sir! Sir, please forgive me, sir! (GRUNTING) (GROANING) (GROANS) I'll let you know if Leon gets admitted here. Yes, please. I've been calling the police stations. I also went there asking for him, but they also heard nothing. So, please, let me know. - Don't worry, I'll update you. - (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello? Your boyfriend is here. - (BODYGUARD GRUNTING) - (GROANING) The son of a bitch was trying to steal from me. (WHIMPERING) Enrique, please. Don't do anything. If you don't come here now… I swear, you'll never see him again. (SOMBER PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) (DOOR LOCK BEEPS) (DOOR OPENS) Leon! Leon! Leon! Leon! Leon! Damn it, Leon! Wake up! Leon! I'm sorry. (SOBS) Leon! Damn it, answer me! ANGEL: Leon. Leon. Leon! Angel. Angel… Don't do this. I'm not done yet. Come back to me now or maybe I will bury him in the desert. Don't do this, please. Please, I beg you. The choice is yours, Angel. (SENTIMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) No, no. (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) I don't need that. He did let you come here. This is it. Is this really it? (ANGEL SNIFFLES) I'm going to miss you. (EXHALES DEEPLY) (SNIFFLES) (KISSES) I'm going to miss you too, a lot. Take care of yourself, okay? (ANGEL SNIFFLES) Make all your dreams happen because… (SNIFFLES) …that is my dream for you. (SNIFFLES) (DELICATE MUSIC PLAYING) Without you by my side? (SNIFFLES) Yes. How will it be for you? I'm okay. I'm okay that… once in my life, I was loved by someone like you. (CHUCKLES) I've been through a lot. I can survive this. I'm okay because I know you're going home safe and alive. (SOBS) (BREATHES HEAVILY) I can't do this. (SNIFFLES) You can. (SOBS) ANGEL: You can. (SNIFFLES) LEON: I love you so much. (BOTH SOB) I can't do this. ANGEL: Yes, you can. Angel, I can't. (BREATHES HEAVILY) Go on, Leon. Go on. Go, you might miss your flight. (SNIFFLES) (SIGHS) (SNIFFLES) Be safe here. I love you so much. Go on. Walk away and don't look back.

I'll be back with my new boyfriend! (GIGGLES) CAT: But this time, I made sure he has a CENOMAR! Good for you. LEON: So, are you still visiting Juniver in jail? No. I've let go already.
