Be honest. Don't lie. Or else you'll have it coming. Why? You know the baker boy who comes to deliver pastries every day? He came to Shanghai as a teenager. Rowed a boat here on his own. The kid had no one to count on. Later, he started to study baking under his current boss. After a few years, he got good at it. He's a smart kid. The boss had a daughter. He carefully made moves on her, and quietly won her heart. But the boss wouldn't approve since he has nothing. So the girl goes to her mom to help persuade her dad. The boss then asks him, "What is your ideal wife like?" The little smart-ass thought, "Who wouldn't want a pretty and rich girl like your daughter?" But he plays coy and says, "If there is love, I wouldn't mind if she's ugly or poor." Thinking this would gain his boss's trust and would agree to their marriage. But the boss is smart enough to know that he's untrustworthy. So he ends up marrying a poor servant's daughter. An ugly girl from a poor family. He came over this morning to deliver pastries. Mama Wang made fun of him. "What happened? You look awful." He rolled his eyes and left without taking the money. Mr. Lu. Sit. I don't care which side you are on or what your claims are, as long as they are for Shanghai and everyone gets along. I'm fine with workers wanting to go on a strike to get a raise, and I am willing to help them. But now, the water and power are down. Yesterday, somebody lined three tramcars across Xiafei Road, blocking the traffic. It has become a real problem which is not good for anyone. Seeing their families going hungry and their kids starving. Some workers demanded water, power, and traffic to go back, but they were beaten up badly. Thirty of them even got abducted. It was you, right? No. I think you misunderstood. All we want is to help the workers get more rights. We wouldn't resort to an abduction. I had a welcome gift delivered to your missus yesterday. Did you receive it? We did. Thank you. The gift is a token of our goodwill and friendship. So that we can quickly solve this abduction business. I really want to help, Mr. Lu. I respect you very much. I would be happy to do your bidding, but we really did not abduct anyone. How can I possibly help? I swear. In the name of my wife, in the name of my mother... It's okay, I believe you. Tea? Get us some snacks. Snacks. I'm outraged by this kidnapping. This strike got so long and so nasty because bad elements got inside the workers. The workers don't want the problem solved or the strike to end. They deliberately mess things up. These people don't have feelings like normal people. They don't like what we have now. The high buildings, the social order, the good food, the fun, and the nice stuff, they don't like any of that. Or are they up to something? They don't care if Shanghai is destroyed. This is horrible, indeed, but-- Please wait. Clear these away. I'm gonna go. Where are you going? I can't stand it here. I'm off to lunch. What's wrong with you people? Idiots. I'll come here for tea tomorrow, as usual. A nice place like this deserves good care. Don't make a big mess here. Thanks. No problem, don't worry. I apologize. I know she's not your actual wife. So please understand. Mister. Another job done? Thanks for allowing us here. We bought you a train ticket. Now just tell me where you keep those workers. Taking that with you? No. But I'm grateful. I meant the hand. No. Goodbye, Mr. Zhou. Mr. Zhou. Do you need to go back to your hotel to pack? Okay. Let's head straight to the train station then. Please. Where are you from? I'm from Zhejiang. Where in Zhejiang? Xiaoshan. Xiaoshan. What brought you to Shanghai? Tough times. Thought I would come here to learn how to trade and make money. Are you married? Not yet. Girlfriend? There is a girl back home. Sweet girl. I'll go back and marry her once I make enough money. Have you done it? Done what? Bed her. No. We held hands, though. No kidding? He's still a virgin? How old are you? I'm turning 20 next month. Shit, let me tell you something. I've got this cousin, he's a doctor. He said, before you turn 20, you got to take your thing out for a spin. What thing? What do you think? What else? What? Your dick. Or what? Or it won't work very well in the future. Bullshit. No bullshit! My cousin's famous. Ask anyone around Pudong. He's basically pulled the teeth of the entire neighborhood. So he's a dentist? It's all the same. Anyway, he's got a point. It's not like you have to use it every day. Just once before you turn 20 to get your system moving so it'll work in the future. Have you done it? I did it last year. But I'm telling you, it's addictive. Once you do it, you'll want it all the time. I can't do it. I have a girlfriend back home. For heaven's sake. You're almost 20, you can't wait. It's for her benefit in the future. She'll understand. You're useless. Where are we? It's the wrong road again. Are you a virgin, too? What are you doing? Get out. What are you looking at? I have a son. He's the same age as you. Shit, virgin boy. You're good! You're gonna be big someday. All the more reason to help you get laid. What did the old thing say to you over there? He said I look like a virgin. You don't want to mess with Mama Wang. You'll be sorry if you get on her bad side. Nobody messes with her. She always makes fun of that poor baker boy. I feel sorry for him. Of course, you do. Need me to help take a look? Don't rush me. Your people are coming to discuss things tomorrow. It would be good for you to join. My people? You mean the Japanese? I'm not going. The Japanese give me a headache. I'm Shanghainese. What are you laughing at? My wife, your sister, is Shanghainese, right? My sons, your two nephews, are also Shanghainese. I also speak the language, then I'm Shanghainese, too. What are they meeting you for? They want to discuss business with me. These Japanese are up to no good. What business? They only want war. I think it's best if you don't go. They've contacted Mr. Wang, and he didn't want to meet them. How could I say no? Then just be careful. They're the worst. You say that, but if the Japanese are really at war with us, what would you do? What would you do? I would fight for Shanghai, of course. I win! I told you I'm Shanghainese. I beat you all at mahjong. I have to go now. Give my winnings to my wife, as usual. By the way, I told you this morning not to make a mess at the teahouse. You didn't do anything, did you? Not in the teahouse. Good. You guys play with yourselves. You two little monsters. Don't be naughty. Your brother is meeting the Japanese tomorrow. Those people are coming for no good. You tell him to be careful. I don't meddle with his business. So he just won and took off? Call him back. I invited Mr. Mei for dinner tonight. He should come. Mr. Lu, you asked for me? We need a fourth player. I'm busy. Seriously? I have a lot of stuff to do unlike you. What stuff? Making fun of that poor baker boy again? Why do you care who he ends up marrying? Who told you about that? Everyone has been asking me. It's not like I said anything. I just made a comment that he looked awful. He did really look awful. You should see the color of his face. He's a young man who just got married. I want to make sure he's not working too hard. You're mean. His wife is too ugly. He'll be fine. Well, I just made that one comment, and then he glared at me and took off without the money. What was that? What did I do wrong? He comes to deliver pastries and groceries every day. You keep teasing him like that. If he poisons us, it will all be your fault. I dare him. I'll skin him. You're here again. Come. Right on time. Are you hungry? Do you want some meat? I can cook some for you. Just don't take my portion. This is mine. Wait a second. Come here. It's delicious. Here. Hey. What a rare occasion. Are you hungry? Do you want me to cook you something? I just had dinner. Great! Money saved. Mama Zhang is grumpy today. What did she do? I felt her bad mood the moment she opened the door. Ignore her. You all had dinner with Mr. Mei tonight, and you didn't bring me along. So she's upset with you. Is she upset or you? Her, of course, I would never. I mean it. No matter what you do, I would never get mad at you. The Japanese Ministry of Commerce wishes to work with Mr. Wang, Mr. Lu, and Mr. Zhang to establish an East Asia Co-prosperity Bank. The form of this partnership is that we provide all the finances. While Mr. Wang, Mr. Lu, and Mr. Zhang provide us with your networks in Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu. We will honor all your efforts in terms of shares. It'll be a most favorable arrangement to the satisfaction of all of you. Have some tea. We also heard that your son works in banking. Perhaps he can oversee the whole affair. My son is conventional and never gets involved in my business. We appreciate your generous offer, but to be honest, the timing now is too sensitive. We just can't work with the Japanese at this moment. This banking partnership is purely a civil enterprise and has nothing to do with the current situation. Really? Then what's with the army uniform you are wearing? About the shares you mentioned, how many? Have some tea. Zhang seems willing to work with us. We should just kill Lu. It'll shake Shanghai to the core if you do. I just want us to think it through. What is there to think about? You think I don't know? You boy scouts want to hold a meeting again, right? I have decided. We will kill Lu. We need your expertise. Please arrange it. Very good. Today's porridge is too salty. Cook another pot for the Mister. Yes. Mama Wang, anything else? There is another thing, but I forgot it. It's probably not important. Why didn't the baker boy come today? Is he still mad at me? TO MR. LU So the Japanese want war. There is nothing we can do. Who are we after all? But now they have made it personal. That has to be addressed. I know you are sad because of Mama Wang. So am I. But now you can't be too quick with your moves. Didn't they invite you to dinner? Go, then. Sort out the Mama Wang thing first. They have to pay for that. You pick the place. Just don't go to Hongkou. Okay. You and your waiter are Japanese. They will feel more at ease. There's nowhere else? I don't have tables there. Do you want to sit on tatami mats with them? That won't be a problem. I will handle it. It all tastes funny. Mama Wang didn't sleep well last night, or one of you guys pissed her off again. Mama Wang went back home, so she'll be gone for a while. I'm done. I'm off to work. I ate too many meatballs yesterday. I am gaining weight. Buy some fabrics, make a new cheongsam. You look tired. Zhang has a municipal council meeting. He will go straight there. I told him to be on time. He seemed unhappy about the bank offer. After this is resolved, I want to give him the factory on Panyu Road as a compensation. Your feet are so big. Really big. Big feet means a big dick. Bullshit. That's what my cousin said. Do you think of anything else other than your cousin and dicks? Of course. And women. Tonight. No. 38, Sima Street, second floor. Just be there and you'll know. And then what? Then... you'll feel like you haven't lived before. Hey, look at those Japs. Their dicks must be tiny. Like yours. I pulled the trigger. What will you do about it? Here comes our people. You should go back. I said you should go back now. Don't you have a girlfriend back home? You should go back to marry her. I'm not going. Haven't we been through this already? What girlfriend? There is no one else. You've recovered. I don't know why you keep living here. I'm addicted now. I want you all the time. I can't live without you. I'm not a freeloader. I'll go out in a bit to find work, make money. With the war going on out there? What work? There is always something. I should be the one working, not you. You should stop working. I'll support you. Mr. Lu. You really have nothing else to do? Being meddlesome is really not good for your health. He sent you, didn't he? Tell him to come talk to me himself. A bunch of guys bullying a girl... Aren't you ashamed? We're ashamed, that's why we had to get you back. You people know no shame. Everybody knows you've been fooling around. Even Boss knows. Nobody said anything because we know shame. But now you are doing it so publicly. You're making a fool of him. Tell him to come and divorce me. Boss just got a divorce to marry you. Now, it's hardly six months. How will this make him look? I don't care how he looks. Boss is getting old. Have some empathy. Regardless, I still respect you as the Boss's wife, but don't you ever forget who we are. What's the point of living a life like this? All those people. They are everywhere. Is there a place that has less people? Take me away. Just the two of us. I am responsible for a lot of people. I can't just do as I please. How about this? Stop fooling around and you will be rewarded. Don't you want to get the lead part in Love In Bloom? I can arrange it. Don't bullshit me again. Miss Wu already got that part last week. As long as you behave, I can talk to Mr. Dai and get Miss Wu to pull out. Your words... better be good. When are my words not good? When is the audition? Director, how do I die? By suicide or murder? All the director does every day is cry. He just bursts into tears while shooting. Something bad must have happened back home? I have no idea. Nobody does. And nobody dared to ask. After we did a scene this afternoon, I turned to him, he was there crying again. So I went over and said, "Director, I'm sorry. Did I do something wrong? Then how should I do it? Just teach me. Don't cry." Then he wiped his tears off and said, "No, I just can't believe this is your first time acting. You're so good, I'm moved!" Don't make fun of your director. I'm just sharing with family. The day I auditioned, he told me to do the last scene which is when my character is already dead. So what's there to see? I didn't know what to do so I ended up asking him. "Director, how do I die? By suicide or murder?" He has the script, but he thought for a long time and then said, "I don't know. What happens next is anyone's guess. It may not be suicide or murder." Then how do you die? I don't. It's possible I don't die in the end. I suffer a lot, but I survive. Tell us about Mr. Zhao. What's he like? Mr. Zhao? I don't know, I haven't met him yet. He's the star. His scenes are arranged to be shot all together later. He won't be on set until next week. Too much talking and not enough eating. I wouldn't say too much if I were you. We were just complaining about your food. Seriously? They bought a new pan last week. Some steel made by foreigners. I knew there would be problems. You people always make fun of me. Keep laughing, I'm off to sleep. I almost forgot, I have something serious to talk to you about. I'm listening. My old rickshaw guy, who took me for groceries, left to get married. Two days ago, a new guy came. He's really strange. How so? The gentleman who introduced him secretly told me that this guy can help me do anything. Take me to the market, buy fabrics for the Missus, and... And what? And other things, such as killing people. Mama Wang. Now, you're even talking about killing people. I'm not. I just asked for a rickshaw ride. Mama Wang, don't mind her. Go on. No matter what you ask him to do, he would only charge you the rickshaw fare. Like today, if you send him to Nanjing Road to buy fabric, he would go there, come back with the fabric, and charge you for the round trip. If you send him to Xujiahui to kill somebody tomorrow, he would go again, kill the person, come back, and will still charge you for the round trip only. You would think that tomorrow's job is more difficult, and would want to give him more money, but he would say, "I'm a rickshaw puller. I pull the rickshaw. I just help out with other stuff. Buying fabric or killing people, whatever it is, I'm not charging a penny more." So, he's basically always running about with an empty rickshaw? Exactly. Why are you telling me this? He's special. Isn't it a waste for him to just pull an old lady for groceries every day? Don't you want to meet him? Bring him to me tomorrow. Great. Mama Wang. Yes? I'm short of a mistress now. Please keep an eye out for that, too. I would appreciate it. Stop teasing me. Just stand still, don't say anything unless you're spoken to. Keep your face straight. Eyes not too high or too low. Keep them steady, but not blank. Be sharp. And keep your composure. It's just like... an audition, you know? Sure. I'm not just talking about how you treat women. It's not just that. I got used to that a long time ago. I'm talking about other things. I've seen through your so-called "universal love." What you show as tolerance and affection is nothing but selfishness and self-preservation. Also laziness and avoiding responsibility. Universal love is merely the safest and most convenient name for you to hide behind, while living your lazy, selfish, and petty life. Lives are wasted because of men like you. What I want... is a man who is capable of love and hatred. I don't love you anymore. Goodbye. Mr. Zhao. You are such a slut. You'll definitely make a good actress. A big star. You are so vulgar and silly, but so exquisite in front of the camera. So elegant, it's incredible. You're a born actress. So which one do you prefer? To behold, I appreciate elegance. But to play, I like vulgar. People today like to act like players with a lot of dirty affairs, but only you are not acting. I'm an actress. You know what I am. I'm a slut. Talk to the Boss for me. Please set me free. You make it sound so easy. Then let me die. I'm already dead inside anyway. All these affairs and silliness are just ways to pass time. I know you're not going to kill me. You would hate to lose me. So you'll think of a way. Cheer up. If there's no other way, kill her. That slut is not worthy anyway. I'm thinking about what she said. It doesn't feel right. What did she say? Nothing, really. Where are you going? I'll go to Mr. Wang. Do you want some? Sure. If you are so hesitant, don't do it. I'm not hesitant. I'll do whatever you say. Then don't do it. I said it. There is no point in killing for this. It's just a reputation thing. Send men down to the studio and get the negatives back. Let the tabloid gossip about it, and we'll get a bit of reputation back. Either the company wants to remake the movie or make something else. We'll give them money under the table as compensation. It's just a movie anyway. Got it. But those two can never be seen in Shanghai again. Send them away from Shanghai as far as possible and never to return... if they want to live. Everybody will think they are dead, and nobody will think less of us. I'll have my brother-in-law take them to Suzhou and make sure they take a train bound north. That's good. Okay. Make it look real. Slip her some money so she'll manage. I know. This thing can't get out. I don't tolerate big mouths. Stop. I think you should do it with seriousness. You should do it with a sense of righteousness. If you do it as you just said, your hands will tremble when you put the poison in. And you turn to watch me, for fear that I might wake up. It feels that you know you're doing something wrong. Then the whole scene would be different. So, no trembling hands. And don't turn, be calm. What do you think? Whatever you say, you're the star. I'm just a hanger-on. Trust me, you will succeed. Really. Cut. You're trying to poison your wife. How could you be so calm? You should have all these emotions rolling and broiling inside you. They should be reflected in your physical movements. You should watch out for her when you put the poison in. To express your nervousness, your hands should be trembling! Director. All this roiling and broiling, it's too abstract. Miss Wu, you're terrific. It's not you, it's your husband I'm talking about. What do you want to eat tonight? I'll cook for you. Go home first. I need to rest a bit. I'm not going to play mahjong. I'm going to work on the script. It's raining. Can I take your car? Sure. Thanks. It's my husband. The Division Commander caught him... with one of his mistresses. Now, they won't let him go. Can you help me look into it? Whatever it takes, just get him out first. He has my car. It's okay, I think I know the way. Miss Wu. Mr. Lu has already returned. He'll help you. Everything is going to be okay. You don't want to meet him looking like this. Okay. This is the first time you've seen me, but not the first time I've seen you. I've watched all your films. Have some food. We need to go to Mr. Dai for your problem. I will take you to him. Miss Wu, Mr. Lu asked me to pay you a visit. How is everything going? Good. Thanks to you and Mr. Lu. I brought you pastries. You know me well. I love pastries. Have some, then. Sure. Do you want tea? No, thanks. -Please sit. -Yes. Miss Wu. I watched your new film a couple of days ago. You're splendid in it. Thank you. It's just that... I didn't quite get the film. Sorry to hear that. But it's quite normal. I didn't get it either. Really? I've been wanting to ask you about it. I asked the director the same thing. He actually never wanted anybody to get it. He said that it's an art film, for art's sake, made for people of the next century. Wow. We'll all be dead by then, so it has nothing to do with us. Quite right. I almost forgot what I'm here for. This is for you. It's a gift from Mr. Dai. After he met you briefly last time, he has been thinking about you. He really likes you. Miss Wu, please don't get mad. I'm just a messenger. Please hear me out and don't get me wrong. Mr. Dai said these are chaotic times, and there is only more chaos to come. He's buried in work every day, but the thought of a lady like you living in such troubled times really makes him worried. He's so worried that he couldn't even sleep. He is concerned about you and has the ability to protect you. Mr. Dai is a thoughtful person. He'll handle this very well. What does that mean? Isn't this strange? It's nothing weird. Do you dislike Mr. Dai? No, I respect him. There you go, great. Great? I'm a married woman. Mr. Dai knows. So he has specially arranged a good job for your husband. A high position with a good pay. The job is fairly easy and safe. Mr. Dai is going to send him to Yunnan. How is that possible? Why not? Before I came here, the day before yesterday, Mr. Dai talked to your husband about it. About last time, I do thank Mr. Dai. But please show me and my husband some respect. Your husband already agreed to it. He didn't tell you? You knew it already. Why didn't you tell me? I'm still thinking about it. Okay, then don't go. You must know that I'm not actor material, and I'll never become a star. Now these are chaotic times, and there's more chaos to come. It's not easy to find a good job. Whatever happens outside, we can still live our own life. Whatever happens, at least we'll be together. But I want to go. This is a dream opportunity. It's a high position and a lot of money. The job is easy and safe. They brought it on a platter to you. You know, the moment you leave Shanghai... I'll have to move to Mr. Dai's residence. It'll be all right. You know, wherever I am, my heart will always be with you. And I believe you are the same. Wherever you are, your heart... will always be with me, right? Indeed, you're not actor material. You were awful when you were acting. Really. But you pulled off that line... adequately. EAST ASIA CO-PROSPERITY BANK Mr. Dai says the Japanese are about to attack Hong Kong. He has arranged a plane to fly you to Chongqing along with Miss Wu. And... Zhang is coming out of his lair. He's going to Nanjing. He told people that he's going by car, but he's actually taking the train from Shanghai North Train Station. I hear Lao Wu is doing pretty well back in Shanghai. Socializing with all sides. She could be helpful. She just needs to get me a pass. Hello? Mr. Lu? I'm listening. Understood. How are you? What time does the train for Nanjing leave? Why are you here? Go back. Mr. Zhang. Mr. Zhang. To all Chinese citizens, to the people who love peace all over the world. Today, the victory is ours. Right will triumph over might. This great truth has finally been vindicated. It marks that our national revolution... I remember the first time I met you. We were sitting face to face just like this. I still remember what I said. I said I watched all your films. Sorry, I shouldn't have mentioned films. If I stay in Chongqing any longer, I'll starve to death. All the food here tastes terrible. A little spicy is fine with me. I've gotten used to it. Perhaps I just hate this place so much that I have no appetite. I love Shanghai, so I love Shanghai food. I hate Chongqing, so I hate Chongqing food. Perhaps your love of a place makes you love its food as well. Are you okay? Back in Shanghai, my brother-in-law had a Japanese restaurant. Have you been there? Stop. Go back. Go back. Stop the engine. You're back. When did you come back? You should have said something. I just got back. You two were sleeping. He has been good? I wish. He has been stirring all night. I'm exhausted. Take this and eat. You're back. Any troubles? The driver is visiting some relatives in Suzhou, and he said he would be back in a few days. What's the matter with him? So you drove the car back yourself? Yes. Lu won't cooperate. But Zhang seems willing to work for money. We can consider getting rid of Lu first. Do it. I ate too many meatballs yesterday. I am gaining weight. Buy some fabrics, and make a new cheongsam. You look tired. What has come over you? Are you crazy? It's the middle of the day. Where are the kids? Downstairs in the yard. Why did you shoot me? Wait. Why did you let him go? Idiot. I shot you because you forgot to shoot me. I could have killed him just now! You let him live on purpose because you couldn't leave your two kids alone. Tomorrow, you're going to post Ikeda and my obituary in both Shanghai and Japanese newspapers and restore Shanghai's order. Until after we have occupied Shanghai, I will have a new identity and a new mission. There will be a new battlefield. I'm counting on you... to handle things. For Imperial Japan, make or break! For Imperial Japan, make or break! What about her? Kill her off. How did things end up like this? I never wished the war to end. I never wished... to survive it. Yet now, I want to live. Can you help me find my sons? Take them to Yokohama, Japan. I have a house and land there. You can grow crops to live. After all this is over, I'll go find you and the boys. I saw you get into the car. You were supposed to go to Suzhou and take a train bound north from there. Sometimes I think of you. You were supposed to be in the North. I'm going to need an army uniform. Who do you want to extradite? I made the right decision by not killing you. They are big boys now. Leave with me. I can't let you live. You're not going to hurt them. Nobody is going to hurt them. I know you people too well. ALL INTRUDERS WILL BE SHOT Stop crying. There is no time for tears. Listen to me, you have to survive. That camp will protect Japanese. Tell them you are Japanese. Do you understand? I am your dad. You must run over there and tell them you are Japanese. You must go back to Japan. Do you understand? Japanese. Japanese. Japanese. SHANGHAI EIGHT DISTRICT BUREAU Sir, over here. Hat off. Hands up.
