Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Hello? Daph? Daphne? Sorry. I'm in the shower, I'll be out in a sec! Will, I'm good, I'll be out in a sec, just give me just two seconds, please. Okay. Go ahead. I decided I want to be a teacher because I want to help people. People who've had a hard time need help and protection and to feel safe, like kids. It's really scary to be a kid. And I know what that's like. I will work so hard to help people. If you just give me a chance. If it's awful, just tell me. No, it's not awful. Hey, I got you something. It's from a quote I really like. It's for you. Hey, are you okay? What happened to Adriana? Her father died. Oh. I'm so sorry. What's your son's name? Okay. Daphne, you still work at Behemoth as a project manager? Yes. And you have said your parents won't be involved. Still true? Yes, we don't speak to them. Is that your brother? Yes, that's Wilson. And he works as a janitor. Mm-hmm. He's the best. You can totally write that down. Best. You and Adriana had a more informal back and forth, and there were some things that came up on your application. Right. My brother and I, we had a difficult childhood. My 20s were not great. I was lost and angry. It's been five years since I've had a drink. I don't do drugs anymore, I've never missed therapy. I've had a steady job for the past five years, and my student loans are almost gone. It's more complicated than that. The last time you were here. That was in anger. I didn't realize how- - I would like to review. Adoption is very serious, Daphne. I'm not sure what a meaning battery is, but perhaps you could explain? I've heard and learned, and read that people use children to cover up problems with their own lives, with their souls. People think that they own their kids. That they're theirs. They're not, they're their own. You're only there to help them protect them. With your history, what would you do if you were me? Keep up the good fight. Oh, hey. - Hi. - Hi. It's three a.m.. He's dead. Okay, well, can't you make, this is like a mystical thing can't you make them undead? Can I just have it back? You don't have the card to make it undead. Okay, well I, let's, I think you're fucking making that up. No wait, then I trample your devil with my fucking cup knight. - If you do, I'll just block. - No, your devil killed my gorgeous chariot or whatever thing and must die now. Okay. So you attack? Fuck yes, I attack. Okay, so I cast Strength and block with my tower and kill your cup knight. Fuck! I'm fucking awesome at this game. It's all part of my plan, you don't even know. - Okay. - I don't wanna like embarrass you 'cause I know it's like your thing. Will? Are you okay? No no no no. Sit down, sit. - I got it, I just, No, I got it. - Sit down. Sit down, hold my hand. Hold my hand, you're having a panic attack. Okay? Okay, I know this is scary, but it's not gonna last. I know it's scary, but it's gonna pass, I promise. Okay? Just breathe slow. Hold my hand. Just keep holding my hand. I'm not the eye of the tiger? No. Will, that literally makes no sense. I hate the way I am. Well, I like the way you are. You're pretty okay. You're super fuckin' annoying, though. I am super fucking annoying. I'm super fucking annoying. You're super fucking annoying. Just take a deep breath. I'm taking a lot of deep breaths. Just like a slow one now. Can I help you? Wilson Shaw? - Hello, sir. - Nobody called you did they? Did you go to college for four years? Just one year. I got some bad news for you. We reviewed your resume, and given your skill set, I think you'd be better served elsewhere. Hey Daph? Daphne? Daph? I'm here. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Can you hear me? Hey. Look at me, look at me. Okay. Look at me. Come on, we gotta go. You gotta help me. Help, help. No! Come on! It's okay, I know you're scared, it's okay. Come on! Come on! You gotta help me! You gotta help me! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Just wait, just wait! Yeah, someone, someone just murdered my sister. But I just found her. Listen, listen to me! Listen. I just was in the room and I saw someone. I saw someone go out the window. Please just write it down. Victim's name is Daphne Shaw. Found dead in her apartment. I saw a man run out the window. 4-82. Up on the roof, down the fire escape, around the corner. You did see him? Well, how did he get down in the 20 seconds it took you to get up to the roof, for him to get up the roof and down all the way to the street? Once you got down there, did you see him again? Did you see the man after you got down to the street? Deep breath in. Deep breath in. How to act or react. People always trying to engage you Mostly I just wanna be out of there. My sister was a kind person. And now she is dead and gone and will never get to be kind to anyone ever again. She is rotting now. And will rot forever. People have said that drugs did this to her. That it was an accident. This is not true. She was murdered. This is not right. Evil is still out there. And I will find it. I will find it, Daphne. Did you see a guy earlier? He was a guy in a dark coat. Still nothing, man. Okay, thank you, sir. Sorry about your sister. Have you seen anything? Sorry. He could be wearing something different, or like a different- - No, you gotta go to the police Yeah. Sorry. Someone hurt my sister. And I'm looking for him. Hello, Interim Storage. Hello? Hello, did you just say something? Yeah, hi. Who's this? We keep things for the state department, primarily. Who is this? This is Wilson Shaw. Someone gave me this number. They said it was important that I should call you. Have you had a tragedy in the family recently? June 12th. I dreamed that I died and was reborn as the wind. I would love this. I love the wind. It feels like the world softly hitting you in the face saying wake up, wake up, you're alive. I need to tell Wilson about everything. It's getting closer every day now. It's not even at the bars and the clubs like it used to be. It's following me home from work. I was able to cover the bruises this time, but I lost a tooth. I need to tell Wilson. But what could he do? Hello? Hello? Are you okay? Who are you? You know who I am? Wait. It's you. Isn't it? You're coming with me. No! Hello, Wilson. I knew your sister very well. I had a plan for her. And now it's your turn. I have plans for you, Wilson Shaw. Hey. Hey. Hi. Can you sit down closer? Please. Sit. Wait, no, I don't know all the rules. How? I've been trying for a while. It's like trying to wake up. Are you evil? No. That looks like my sister, that's trying to torment me? I am Daphne. You're my brother. You brought home a painted turtle one summer as a pet and you named him Graxor the In fabulous the Turtle, which I told you was too many dangling modifiers, and Mom made you try to kill him with a hammer and I did it for you. Okay? What if you're just my imagination? Paroxetine is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor. Five hydroxytryptamine, five HT. I know that. Do you? Right. So you're a ghost. Don't label me, Will. Maybe I'm just part of another world of collective unconscious, or maybe humans are just ghost dreams and you're part of our collective unconscious. It's not about you. Hey, Daph. Hi. I don't remember at all. I don't remember anything. It's jumbled, it's like someone's fucking with my brain and taking stuff out. I thought I would have left something. I thought there would be something in my stuff. Yeah, the journal. We know you had a stalker, took me to the alley, and we know the enemy now. A stalker. We know it was him. I don't- - The police couldn't help? I don't remember. It's up to me. I'm gonna find him. How? I'm gonna find him, and I'm gonna make him confess. How, Will? You can barely tie your own fucking shoes. What are we gonna do, Daph? I don't know, Will, I'm a ghost. I can't do shit. - But I can. I can do it, Daph, I can become strong enough to fight him. I'm not gonna let you do that. Will, he broke you like it was a game. I'm not gonna let you get hurt. Are you kidding me? - He let me live. He doesn't think I'm a threat. I'm going out there! - Stop! Okay? Will, people can't just be different. Yes I can. Daph. I swear it. I can become someone who can stop the man that killed you. I want to become a fighter. Like you. - Like me? I was five and six. Not that kind of fighter, Daph. In life you were the strongest fighter I'd ever seen. Okay. Okay. You want to fight our stalker. You say you want to become like me. I'm not sure you actually want that. But I love you. And we will try. Get up! Get the fuck up! When Mom and Dad got mad, you cowered and apologized for existing. You cannot do that anymore. Ow! Get up. Don't be fooled into thinking this is only about strength, or toughness, or discipline. This is why you're still 14. You are still a child. The only way to change is to kill that child. This isn't about gaining anything. It's about losing something. Otherwise you will stay a lost little boy, scared of the world, scared of himself, and scared of his own shadow. And when my killer comes back for you, he will kill you too. Daph, I'm sorry. What are you apologizing for? Because I'm failing. What do you think this is? That you read some books, you wake up real early and get a fucking merit badge? I wanted to have a life. I wanted to have a family, a real family, with children I treated like they were the sun. I wanted to make the world a better place and somebody took that away from me, and you're fucking giving up! - No, I can't give up. - You should. Somebody killed my sister and I need to stop him. Give up. But I love her. Then your love means shit, doesn't it? You love like a mewling worm. You love like a fucking dog. Fuck you! What? Fuck you. That is what I need. Okay? There we go. Protect your face. Can you feel it? Can you feel that child inside of you die? Good. Let it go. Let it die. Good. Oh god, get the fuck away from me. Get the fuck away from me. It's me, it's Will, it's Will. Hey, look at me. - You're fucking lying to me! I'm not, I'm not. It's okay. - Fuck you. It's okay, you're on the street? Leave me alone. I'm Will, it's me. I promise. It's me. Daphne. It's okay, you're on the street outside your apartment. I'm your brother. I'm Will. - Go. Who am I? What's my name? You're not him. You're Daphne Shaw, I'm Wilson, this is the street outside your apartment. Go. Look around, what do you see? No, leave me alone, leave me alone. Okay. Okay. Do you want to be inside? - No. Keep looking at me. Stick with me. I swear it's me. Look at me. I swear. All right. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. - Really fucking embarrassed. - It's okay. Hey, don't fall over. My life is fucked up, this is so fucked up. It's okay. You're okay. - Oh god. You're okay, you're okay. You're with me. - Yeah? - You're Daphne. - Yes, yes. - I'm Wilson. - Yes. We're gonna go inside, it's gonna be nice and warm. Mm-hmm, okay. - Okay? - Okay. - All right. - Okay. - Ready? - Yeah. - Coming in? - Okay. - Fine, all right. - All right, I'm good. All right. Thank you. Oh god. Thank you so much. Remember when you came and found me on the street and you took me home? Come on, we've got a busy night. The Red Room, we haven't checked that out, and we need to go east. At four a.m. we'll go across the bridge. We haven't been there this month. When I first brought you to New York, in our basement one bedroom in Queens, the rat king in the wall? I bartended here. Hey, listen. That's him. Are you sure? Yes. With the hood. There are four of them. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck! Pretend to throw up, now. Now! Will, something is not right about this. I thought when I saw him I'd remember. That's him. We need to head back. If you aren't going to help, then get out of my way. Something is really wrong. We need to get out of here, now. You are a coward. Because I don't want you hurt? You care about that now? I don't. Bum a cigarette? Wilson. No. Oh. Look at me. Wow. Yes ma'am. Do I know you? Where did you get that lighter? Over there. Have a good night. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay! I got the lighter in Chinatown, okay? You still want to hit me? You're having a night, aren't you? - Who are you? - So am I! What's your deal? Do you know Daphne Shaw? No, sorry. Hey. If I hold out my hand, will you shake it? Friends? Friends. My name is David Castille. 94th precinct. You're under arrest. You're under arrest! Gah! Fuckin', why can't everyone just be nice? He's fine, come on, let's get a drink. My wife left me tonight. And you just assaulted a police officer. Let's get a fuckin' drink. Come on. Jesus. You're a roped out motherfucker. You gotta tell me your fitness regime, come on. Come on! I'm just looking for someone. Yes! Yes! Yes! Cheers to that! Ignore those chinless fucks! Come on! Will. Come on! I'm serious, I will arrest you. Come with me. Wilson. Faster. Goddamn Frankenstein motherfucker. Woo! What, are you fuckin' scared of me? You think I'm gonna hurt you? Here. Take my badge. Here. Wanna see my fuckin' gun? Here. Keep it if it makes you feel better. It's kinda cool. Just shoot me in the fuckin' head. Who fuckin' cares? My wife did this to me. You know? Don't you feel oppressed? Don't you feel small and pushed down by life? Like who are these fuckers who have everything? Why do they get to live like this and we're here? Like, look at you, you're fucking retarded or something and nobody cares. Are you retarded? Or right, not retarded, but mentally, like a, fuckin' thing. I get it. Fuck! What about you, man. Why are you running around punching people? I need to find someone. Why? It's personal. Is it a woman? Thought you were in love with? Wants you to beat up her ex? She's dead. Jesus. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Did you really love her? Yeah. She was my best friend and someone hurt her. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Wait, you're trying to find the fucker that messed with her? Yes. And did he have this fucking kind of lighter? Yes. Fuck! I just wanted to, I wanted, I should help you. Who's on your case? First. It wasn't drugs. Okay. They said it was an accident, but it wasn't. Someone killed her. Alright. - The man that I saw- - Yeah. - The man that I'm after- - Yeah. - She's helping me. - Who? She's dead. But she's here. And she talks to me. Okay. Okay. You don't have to explain yourself to me. We all have ghosts. We all have demons. We all do strange things when we can't accept the world around us. I'm sure your sister loves you very much. Wilson. I have a daughter. I didn't even want kids. But I would happily burn myself alive if it meant she was okay. I would burn everyone alive. Love is everything. Who do you keep looking for? You okay? I never said it was my sister. Oh, just wait a second. Just wait a fuckin' second. Gonna take you down to fuckin' lockup, they're gonna fist your ass. Wilson. There she is. I made sure your sister didn't remember me. And you thought I was just a stalker. Will, you can't break someone all at once. It's not fair. But all this pain, it's just a part of a process. A cycle. First, you break the spirit. You cause pain. Like this. A fun game. When I kill someone with a broken spirit, that spirit stays behind, like your sister. Her restless soul. That soul is what I eat. Yes. I can see you. Remember me now, Daphne. This is the last thing you will see before I consume you. Your part in this is over now. Oh god Thank you so much. I am such a fucking asshole. Hi. I got you a coffee. I got you a straw so you could drink. Yeah. Careful, it's hot. Yeah. Thanks for letting me stay. Sorry it's really dusty. A few weeks ago, you said that you saw God. And that it's not out there, it's here. Even if we can't see it. Still feel like that? I don't know. It just felt like I could die and it would be okay. But it's silly. I read this book that said that everything is the ocean. And we're all just waves. And we think we're separate things, but actually, everything's the ocean. That's Buddhism. That's probably "The Heart Sutra." That's nice. You're really smart, sis. I wish I was more like you. You wish you were like me? That's ridiculous. I wish I was like you. You're so great, you're the kindest person I know. Wanna try meditating? Okay. The essence of change is suffering. The essence of suffering is change. Pain is not wrong. Death is not wrong. You are not the story of the you that you tell yourself. You are nothing. You are absolutely nothing, and you are perfect. While you are still alive, be kind, for both you and the enemies will soon scatter and die like leaves and, fuck! Fuck, I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die, do you? No, I don't wanna die, I have too much to do. I've wasted so much fucking time. I don't wanna die, no. No! Buddy, you okay? What are you doing here? That's probably "The Heart Sutra." Wilson, if you are reading this, then I fought the demon and failed, and now you're alone and need to fight for both of us. Hidden inside my favorite Buddhist texts I've shoved the secret history of this monster in our lives and how I've tried to fight it. I protected you from it and I lied to you. I'm sorry I never told you. I realize now how unprepared I left you for what lies ahead. That ends now. I hope it is enough. You and I have been haunted by a demon since we were little. I don't know why it chose us. Maybe because it thought we'd be weak. At first it was just eyes in the back of our closet, knocking outside the window when Mom and Dad fought. Then it found me in nightclubs and bars in my 20s. I thought I fought it off and we were doing okay, but it came back, and I couldn't stop it. I went down a dark path, and I found a ritual to become just like it, to become demonic myself, to fight evil with evil. I still lost. But maybe you won't. The demon has destroyed my body. If it has also swallowed my soul, here is how to bring me back. Oh. Hi. Is Wilson Shaw there? Are you Wilson? I knew Daphne. I knew her from work, but also from the help line that she was trying to do? I met you at the funeral, I think. I'm Dani? I brought you... Daphne left this Christmas ornament at my place by accident. It's a bird. She said that you would always decorate together and that you liked the birds. So, here. I don't know what's happening with you, but I loved your sister, and I'm so sorry that it took me so long to get here. Do you wanna, do you wanna take a walk, or... - Leave. - Well, excuse me? - Leave. - What? Are you- - Leave now. Get out! Go! This ritual of yours won't work, Wilson. I have too many tricks. Accept your fate. Prepare to join your sister inside of me. You failed, Wilson. You and your sister have failed. You have no idea what I can do to you. But I do. I've learned. Give her back. Daph. Daph. Daph. Will. Wait. Wait, wait. It tricks you. Let go Will. It did the same thing to me. With the pills. Will. Stop. Finally. Wilson, wake up. Get outside on the street where someone can see you. Get up. Get the fuck up. Get up! It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Hi. - Daph. - Press. - I'm so sorry. - No, shh. You shut up. You shut your mouth. You were just doing what I told you to. That's all. Hey. I never got to tell you that quote. The one from the necklace. "I sought my soul, but my soul, I couldn't see. I sought my God, but my God eluded me. I sought my brother and I found all three." And sister. Yeah, damn right. Good. Oh, Will, I really fucked up, I'm so sorry. - It's my fault. - No. I should've helped you. Will. It wasn't your fault. Look at me. It wasn't your fault. Daph, it wasn't yours either. Hold on, brother. Hold on. Hold on Okay? Hold on. Hold on. It's warmer now in the city. Wilson survived. He's going back to school. He's getting better. He still sees the demon every day. I still dream. I dreamed I had a family. A long good life. Filled with so many sunsets, and songs, and grandchildren. I dreamed I didn't have to leave my brother in the world I finally love. Goodbye. Goodbye. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
