[gentle orchestral music] [heavy breath] [clock ticking] Queen in F6. - Papa? - Yes? There is something I still cannot fully understand. - What is that? - Why do the pieces sacrifice themselves for each other? [chuckles] It's a tactic... ...within a larger strategy. Checkmate. Ultimately protecting... ...what is most precious to them. [digital glitching] Papa? Papa? What's wrong? Papa? I'm fine, boy. It's just... It's just my eyes. I... I... I must go out to buy a new pair of glasses. Now? I won't be long. We'll pick up where we left off. - Can I come with you? - No, I must go myself. I've told you it's not safe. [door creaking] [ominous orchestral music] [digital glitching] [shoes clicking] [digital glitching] [digital glitching] [digital glitching] Papa! Don't touch me! No! Mine! [door creaking] [birds chirping] [water rushing] Nice eyes and ears, old man. Why don't give them to someone young enough to enjoy them? No! Men: Militia! Militia! Men: Militia! Militia! [driving orchestral music] [marbles clacking] On the Wall: WHERE DREAMS COME TRUE [children screaming] [mechanical legs stomping] [door creaking] Alright, old boy. What can I do for you? I need a used Immersion System. Late model with audio-visual. No olfactory. You're not still living with that thing, are you? What's built from military scavenge will always be military. It's a weapon at heart. This... This came off a guy that was zipped by the militia last week. Almost perfect condition. The ID's not wiped. You'll have to do that yourself. [digital starting noise] Look, I didn't mean anything by... You know... Man: Militia! Oh, God! Not again! [air sirens howling] Wait! - Sorry, old boy! Every man for himself! - Let me in! This your shack? Where did you find that ImmerSyst? [electricity zapping] [yelling in pain] Stop! (electronic whirring) Papa? - Papa? - Boy! Go home! What's this? [electricity zapping] Your doll? Watch out! Itâ€™s unspecked hardware! Looks like military grade! Do not engage! Well, well, well. What do we have here? Let my papa go! Oh! "Let my papa go!" [fake crying] [chuckling] Hey! Toaster oven! Do you think you're human? - What did you say to me? - Don't touch me! [electricity zapping] Please stop! Papa? [alert beeping] Are you my papa? Run, boy, run! [electricity zapping] No! Stop! [yelling in pain] [electronic whirring] [ominous music] [electricity zapping] CONFLICT ENDED DEFENSE MODE DE-ACTIVATED Papa. You may come out. [electronic beeping] I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I will make things the way they were before. I will erase it all away. I love you, papa. Papa. [electronic dinging] [intense orchestral music] Son? Papa? Have you been crying?
