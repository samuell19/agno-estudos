Who am I? Where am I going at this time? Why do I feel secured? When I travel at the time where no one comes out and can see me. I understand one thing clearly the world is ending slowly. The world is so different now when compared to in 2020. My name is Aakash. It's been more than six months since I'm walking towards this forest. I'm not sure whether I would survive or die in this forest. The purpose of recording this. Is for someone who wants to know what I went through during this journey. See these empty roads. No single vehicle. No single human being. It's all empty now I had recorded many good and bad things, many happy and sorrow moments. I have gone through many sleepless nights, starving for food. You know what? The batteries in this camera were stolen by me. From an abandoned store many people made fun of WHO when it declared coronavirus as worldwide pandemic in 2020, They thought that this was a hoax to kill people and control the rapidly growing population. But in year 2022, the COVID-19 mutated itself into a much stronger version called COVID-19 alpha. The recovery rate was less than 20%. Many villagers sealed their village borders. And announced self village governments. It was like a killing machine that was unstoppable. People died in every city, every town and in every village on this planet. And were deprived of last rites as the one who were alive were not ready to risk their lives. Due to this Invisible virus, the world population, which was more than 700 crores came down to less than 500 crores countries like India, which had more than 130 crores was left only with less than 65 crores And USA was below 21 crores population. I was living a normal life in Hyderabad working as software engineer. And my parents were living in a small town. in the year 2018 I had an argument with my parents And then I moved to Hyderabad for fulfill my dreams and was living there until the pandemic was declared in 2020. When the pandemic was announced in 2020 by WHO, I decided to go back to my parents But government had imposed restrictions on travel and did not allow people to move from one place to another. A list was being made of people who wanted to leave the city. My name was also registered in the list and due to huge population migration, I was told that I will have to wait for four years. By the time I shall be allowed to leave the city. Authorities were testing approximately 50,000 people every day with 100% accuracy. things turned bad to worse When my test report showed "POSITIVE" on January 1st, 2024. I was asked to remain indoor in total isolation by authorities. The doctor who tested me, told me that they all are going to a secret safe location by evening. because The global virus controlling authority has decided to release the poisonous gas in all the containment zones worldwide, including Hyderabad so that the spread of the virus can be stopped immediately. I ran out of Hyderabad with the things I had at that time. I walked hundreds of miles towards this forest and ate things I saw on my way. doctor who tested me, gave me three doses of vaccine to cure the COVID 19 Alpha. Which he developed without informing the government. This vaccine did not undergo human trails. So, I have huge risk of cardiac arrest. Or brain stroke or any other severe side effects in next five to six days after taking third dose. I may, I may also lose the feeling of hunger and eventually become weak without eating anything. And die slowly. I already consumed two doses. There is no one around here I don't need a mask. Oh God. I miss my parents, my mom, my dad, my girlfriend. I am not in touch with them for so many weeks. I don't know what happened to my girlfriend. No phone calls, no messages, no contact at all. For last six months. My dad, my dad did so much for me. He sacrificed so many things. And I left him, because he wanted me to get a job in my hometown and get married to daughter of his friend. I cannot forgive myself for not listening to my mother and Left home. I should have convinced my dad. Sorry maa, sorry. Sorry mom, I love you. I love you so much. And I want to see you again. I want to meet you soon. I don't know. I don't know how, let me keep moving. Staying in one place for long could be dangerous. Rain is my friend. Air is my relative. Nature is my God now. Finally, I reached Mother Forest water in this canal is not good. I need pure water where Sand is not polluting it. This is a very big forest. I feel happy for being here, but Sad for the reason I am here. I think I'm the first person who puts clothes to dry in rain, but I don't have a choice. How can I forget this? I have to take the third dose. Oh God, please help me please save me I got only five more days. If I survive next 6 days, then I shall recover And have greater chances of being alive Six days, just six days, I have to survive in this forest. I thought it was easy because it was just six days, but Now, If anyone from global virus controlling authority finds me, then they easily understand that I'm infected and will be threat to others. There are chances that.. I, I shall be shot as I did not abide The instructions from health department where in I was told to home quarantine and ran away from the city to escape from the poisonous gas, they have database of all the people who are corona infected. they are tracking people with the help of cameras, which are Highly sophisticated placed all over the places. These cameras send alerts to the health department by scanning eyes If caught the result is shoot at the site, the situation is very bad in the forest. When I was in Hyderabad, I heard that Many people started moving towards forest as their family members did not tell them into the home. When they tested positive, there is no proper food in the forest, other than some fruits, animals migrated to deeper and middle areas of forest due to the presence of these people. People are hungry here. They are angry and violent. There were rumors that due to shortage of food, they're killing other people who are physically weak so that they can eat them. I am going deep into the forest to not to get caught by patrolling choppers and vehicles of global virus controlling authority. After staying a night in this forest, I came to know that poverty is the biggest devil, demon and ghost on this earth. I asked nature to help me It responded with rain. I want to see my mother, my girlfriend, if I survive. I felt scared after looking at this Lake, it is big and beautiful, but looking monstrous to my eyes, I don't know how to swim. If I fall into Lake accidentally, then my life will come to an end. I have a tent cover along with a few accessories. At first, I was scared to sleep alone in places like these, but now I convinced myself that there are animals out here And most of them - most of the time don't care about me. Unlike humans who try to kill me to snatch food and things from me. I wish I could call my parents. I want to apologize for all that I have done. I regret for all my acts I'm sure that they will feel bad if they know my situation now mobile service is available in some cities and towns, but here I have no such facilities. I'm very hungry now I need to search for food! City kids like me don't know the art of fishing. When I had an opportunity to learn how to fish, I refused it because I thought it was useless to me. I can buy anything I want, but now I regret it. Learning swimming and fishing is as important as learning to drive a car. I'm surviving with two bread packets and water. My breathing is fine now, but I feel heavy on my chest. Um, Oo my girl! Where are you? I hope You are fine. I just want to tell you that how much I love you. I should have treated you Well I misbehaved with you because of my arrogance and stupidity. Now, I realize that you are very important and precious for me. I don't know. If I will ever be able to see you again. I hurt my parents too. I'm a bad son. I got no reason to live unless I see you all I'm an idiot. I'm a fool. God, please give me back. My family. I can breath easily know. God. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I want food, I may die, if I did not get anything to eat now Me too there is no proper food in this forest. There are no humans left. We are unable to find animals to hunt. we need to search entire forest so that we get something to eat. If we find a person, we will kill him and eat him. Let's find someone today. Come on. I miss you mom miss you, please forgive me. I love you so much, please. Forgive me. Just One more day to go. I will be able to meet my parents again. If I don't show any side effects I can also talk to my girl I want to know what happened to her god please, please help me.! Forest is not like what they show us in movies. As far as I go, I saw no fruit, nothing eatable, not even animals to hunt because they stay in deep inside and in central parts of forest. But I feel this forest is healing my lungs with it's pure air It was like touch of mother. But it's ambiance is like dad's anger. It doesn't matter whether you are rich or poor, you are equal in forest. This forest is confusing. This Lake is there at end of every path I take. Maa! He is negative, Otherwise he would be dead already.
