OK. Keep driving straight. A crossing. Good. So it's not your first time? It's my third. Well then, third time lucky. Fucking police, fucking police, fucking police, fucking... Sorry. Well... So far so good. Let's go back to the test centre. Okay. Fucking police, fucking police, fucking police, fucking... Fuck. I'm so sorry. - What was that? - He pulled out, I had to go around him. - It's a solid line before a junction. - I'm sorry. Move over, the test's over. But it's his fault. Please get out of the car. What are you looking at? Fucking hell, stop that! Third time! Third fucking time! Don't touch the girl! - Is she a psycho or what? - Fuck off! I'll fuck you up! - It's a test, I'm recording everything. - Great, then I'll have the evidence. - You drove out in front of me. - Leave the girl! I'm sorry. Fuck off! Or I'll call the police. Now! I'm sorry. Get in the car. So the exam is still on? Are you fucking kidding? Get in the car! You can take it in another area. [FATHER - IRELAND] - They must have been pretty premature. - I managed it before my first communion. I work in transport. I drive trucks. Cool. - Goska! - I'd love to go to Brazil. Might be hard by truck. How did you manage? Like a whore in the rain. Fuck. I've told you not to leave the trash there! Why aren't you at school? Olka! Take this. Fuck, bro. What did you eat? Didn't I tell you not to pig out on kebabs? Do you have to talk such rubbish? It's better than breathing in the stink, right bro? I need a hundred and fifty zlotys. For what? For the test. I already gave it to you. But I failed. Why? Because I suck. Ok, pick him up. OK. Will you give it to me or not? Ask your dad. I can't afford it. He can't find out that I failed. Maybe driving just isn't for you. Thanks for the encouragement. Since you've failed so many times... - And you succeed at everything first time? - 1,500 for the course... Four tests... 600. Move. Since when did you get so good at maths? We've managed without a car so far and it'll be an expense, right? Don't worry, it's not your money. We don't need one. We don't! Because it's a car for me! Get it? It's a gift for me. A gift! He promised me. I'm sorry, champ. Relax. Maybe you enjoy being stuck here, but Pawel and I want to see the world. Right, bro? Yes. Fist bump. Move. Our old man isn't going to drive us around, is he? Not â€œyour old manâ€ but dad. And no he won't. He's working hard so you can eat... and smoke! Get it? You have to tell him! I will. When he gets his ass over here! Yo. Hi. Yo. Hi, kiddo. What's up? Shouldn't you be at school? And you? Sasha, you were supposed to finish 15 fucking minutes ago! Lolek! Can I work today? Okay. Get changed, you can help this dumb-ass. Olka! If there's an inspection, pretend you speak Russian. For today. Thanks. Aren't you too young to smoke? And what's the right age? It says eighteen on the pack, but that's the EU standard and what do they know? I need a favour. - Sasha, why are you pissing me off? - Sorry, boss. Pick it up. Sorry. Well? Can you keep it for me a bit longer? How long? I failed the test. My father will only send the cash after I show him my driving licence. That's the deal. How is he? No idea. We have a deal, he knows nothing about me and vice versa. Fair enough. Tell him that if he wants to come back... Fucking police, fucking police, fucking police, fucking... - What's up? - Hello Olka. When will you be back? What's happened? I got a call from Ireland. Father? No. The number you are trying to reach is currently unavailable. Please try again later. Show me the number. Hi. Hi. It's Ola Hudzik here. Somebody have called us from this number. Yes. I'm calling to say that... I'm sorry, but... there was an accident... What? ... and Krzysztof Hudzik... was hit by a container. Ok. Can I talk to him because his phone is not working? No. You don't understand. He didn't make it. He didn't make what? - For fuck's sake. - What's he saying? Is he hurt? Like badly hurt? Can you repeat? Yes. He is dead. Do you understand? Krzysztof Hudzik is dead. SOMETHING NICE FOR YOU TO DREAM ABOUT. WANNA SEND ME SOMETHING TOO? Next! Mum! Your husband hasn't been registered at the Employment Centre for seven years. Because he worked over there... legally. You need to send us the death certificate and the district head needs to agree to receive the body in his area. Then you'll have to speak to the cemetery manager, and then it'll be... fine. And this death certificate... How do I get it? From the place where he died. And... can someone send it to us? Well... the person who'll take care of it. How much will it cost? I'll write you permission and you'll be fine. I have school! And I don't speak English! Mum... I can't, I'm not even eighteen yet. I've never been on a plane! I can't afford to pay a stranger to take care of it. And we need to bring him here. We're not letting your father lie God knows where. You have to bring him home. The funeral allowance will cover the tickets and you'll get some kind of insurance. Or you can use the money he was saving for you. Will you do it? Do it for me. How are you holding up? Ok. Yeah, right. It's fucked up. It is fucked up. He's fucked us all. Especially me. What? My father... with this car thing. Stop it. He's dead. Exactly. All the money he saved up for me will be wasted on his funeral. You're fucked up. He was your father. Part-time. - Wanna share? - Sure. Best to get a carton now, I've heard they're expensive as fuck over there. I'm quitting anyway. I've got no cash. Look. Oh fuck. He's hot! I'm not sure. He's got a sort of potato face. Hardcore. What should I do? Return the favour. - How? - I don't know... send him your tits. Can I send him yours? Yeah, right. One ticket to the airport. No bottles on board. - And now? - Hop on. But there are no toilet breaks. You'll be ok. Don't cry. I never cry. Are you fucking getting on, or what? The number you are trying to reach is currently unavailable. Please try again later. KAROL: WANNA SEND ME SOMETHING TOO? CAN YOU COME OUTSIDE? KAROL: HOT! - Where are you from anyway? - From Lomza. - Where the fuck is that? - Head north-east, McDonald's is on the left. Doesn't ring a bell. - From Lomza? - From Lomza. - My brother-in-law is from Lomza. - What's his name? Excuse me, is this the â€œMazurekâ€ employment agency? Excuse me. Excuse me. - Can't you see there's a queue? - We're all waiting! I'm on a break. It's getting late and I need to get this done. Everybody does. Please leave. How old are you? Eighteen. Soon. - Come back when you are, then. - It's not about work, it's about my father. Can't he come by himself? He's not able to. Why? He's dead. Krzysztof Hudzik, he worked for you. We don't employ people. With an â€œHâ€... Found him. Krzysztof Sebastian Hudzik? Sebastian? I didn't know that was his middle name. We recently found him a job at Dublin Shipping. Right. And he had an accident there. We had nothing to do with it. I know. So what do you want? Help me find him and handle the paperwork. Then go to his work, or the hospital. - I don't know where it is. - You don't know where your father worked? Fine, hold on. - Excuse me... - I'm on a break! - And this lady? - This lady is just leaving. My wife she paints them for me from memory. Identification, utilisation and legalisation. What? Hospital, funeral home and consulate... in that order. And this is the address they've taken him to. You need a map? Four euros. I've already got one. So, welcome to Ireland. Do you sell bus tickets? They sell it in the bus. Cigarettes? Yeah, sure. Which ones? The cheapest. All cost 12 euros. - How much? - Twelve euros. What the fuck? Fifty zlotys for a pack of smokes? What? ... cervical fractures with injuries to the medulla oblongata and spinal cord. Posterior and lateral aspects of multiple ribs show multi-focal fractures, corresponding with reaching frank laceration of the lung parenchyma, secondary to trauma. Trans-pericardial and trans-myocardial penetration... with bone fragments, resulting in cardiac tamponade. Do you recognise him? No. No? Perhaps you should take a closer look. Anything? Maybe you can identify him from his personal belongings? And? And what? Are these his? How should I know? Was he even your father? You know nothing about him. And do you know what's in your father's pockets? Any distinguishing birthmarks? I need to make a call. Hello? Hi, it's me. All good? Yes. I mean... No, it's not good. It is how it is. You'll handle it. Mum... Did my father have any distinguishing marks? Dad. You mean like a mole or...? Yeah. He had a mole on his buttock. - Seriously? - Definitely there. Well? He had a... mole. On his ass. Seriously? Yes. That's him. Guys, do you have a light? Yes. Fuck. What the fuck? Hey, you okay? Hey, try this one. It works. Do you... Do you wanna go for a beer with us? Lads, grab these off me. Grab these off me. You've got my hand there. - Sorry, here you go. - Thanks. - Cheers. - Cheers. So what's your story? I'm a supermodel and I have a photo shoot tomorrow. Yeah? Wow. No, I... I came to see my father. Is he... Is he living here? No, he's just... moving out. Right. Are you drinking that? Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Oh look, she wants to do a dance. Hang on. Thank you. This pub is unreal, so good. - What? - This pub. - This is why they don't bring him out. - Thank you. Brendon, can you just stop moving? Can you stop moving? Oh, you want to carry him? Fucking go on there, lad. Run, Forrest, run! Hello? Jackie, you are not wearing fucking gloves! Come on man, will ya? Come on, the three of us now. There's four of you there, like. I don't know what you need me for. You're fucking stupid. Come on, let's go. Slide it, slide it, slide it. You know the manoeuvre. On three, two, one, and... go. Hello. How may I help you? I need to transport a body. To where? Poland. Polska, pierogi! This way. Where is the body? You are going to need transport permission from the destination country. Ok. How much does the body weigh? How much do you... weigh? Look, we'll just say eighty kilograms. Internal EU shipping, so if you could come this way. This is what we use to ship the body in. The deceased. Will this work for you? We take care of all the formalities regarding the transport, to the airport and the flights. But you need to organise the transport from the airport in the destination country. Ok, but much would all that cost? Taking it all into account... Three thousand euro. What? Plus the cargo flight, and what did we say, 80 kg for the body and the casket. That should be around 500 euro. So that's... 3500 euro. I heard you were the cheapest. In this case, a thousand euros. Hi, it's me. Were you successful? You think it can be done just like that? I'm confused, who's seventeen here, me or you? Be nice for a change. I sent you an e-mail with a temporary death certificate. Why temporary? I don't know, maybe they'll change their minds. What? I'm sorry. You'll need to take it to the office, and get permission from the district head for him to be buried in our area. - Can I hear you smoking there? - No. I can hear you. What? You're breathing loudly. Well, I was running. Don't lie to me. Fucking hell. That was your last one. How do you know I threw it away? I just know. Ok, let me know when you get it done. Hey, what can I help you? I would like to speak to the manager. What manager? What do you want? It's a personal matter. Listen... I work here, for me there is no thing as a personal matter. Go. My name is Ola Hudzik, my father worked here. Come on. This is a Personal Injuries Assessment Board's report. What does it mean? It means you won't get any money. But my father was a legal worker. Do you want a cup of tea? No, I don't want any tea. I want insurance or something. Look, every employee has a card. A name card, that they stamp when they get in and they get out. That's European Union standard. So... he didn't stamp his card? He did, when he left. But then he switched shifts with someone else. He stamped another man's card to work his shift. Turns out everybody was doing it. But still, he was at his work place then, right? Officially, he broke into the site. He was here illegally and he had an accident here illegally. Do you understand? Yeah. So officially my father is still alive? Officially I don't know. - Officially... - I'm not letting it go. I don't know what else you want me to do? Just wait a minute. Be back in a minute. What the fuck? You were supposed to be over there. PLEASE ENTER YOUR PIN PIN code correct ACCOUNT BALANCE: 9.40 EURO Ok, how long will you be staying? Two nights. Maybe longer. Ok, what kind of room would you like? Two beds, four beds, six? The cheapest. The cheapest is the mixed room. Twenty-five euros. Anything else? Could I have a bed next to the... socket? Sure. Adapter? Yeah. Ten euros. He's got nothing saved up. His account is empty. He lied to me. Maybe he kept it in his room? - Where is that? - The workers' hostel. Do you have the address? Why would I? You're his wife, aren't you? I'm sorry. I'll handle it. Hopefully the money's there. Or I'll be coming back with an empty urn. What? He needs to be cremated. How? We have to burn his body. It's cheaper to transport. Out of the question! Mum, it's either that or paying three thousand euro. Can you do the maths? It's over twelve thousand zlotys. The priest won't agree to bury his ashes! I invited the neighbours, what will they say at church? Mum, I don't give a fuck about the priest and people in the church. I know you got used to me doing everything you tell me to, but I am fucking seventeen. Get it? Watch your language, ok? So give me some time to sort out this shit that my father has done for half my life. I should have gone. Bye! Hi! Can you help me? Get out of here. Hold on a second. What the hell is this? I need help. - Get out or I'll call the police. - They told me at the site... that I won't get money because of an issue with the papers. - I can't do this by myself! - I'll tell them you're stalking me. Get the fuck out. Now. Fine. What are you doing? I'll run and tell everyone that you abused me. You see that? Fuck. Fine, shut the door, I'm in a hurry. Fasten your seatbelt, please. - Will you take a look? - Don't get too informal. How often do you do it? What? What? Blackmail people? That was my debut. You could have just asked. I did. Asking isn't only about the words, it's also the tone you use. You act like you're entitled to everything. I'm sorry. Apologising is also about the tone. I'm sorry. He was working someone else's shift? Yeah. Then you're fucked. Can anything be done? Can you read in English? It clearly says the case is closed. He didn't die because it wasn't his shift, but because it's dangerous there. Do you have any proof? - I was there. - So what? You'd have to have your own photos, expert statements, anything. Even if you're right, you can't sue them for damages. Maybe for poor working conditions. They won't release the body because the coroner will reopen the investigation. I can't afford to transport the body anyway, I told you that. Didn't I tell you not to get too informal with me? - Daddy! - Adam! I've told you not to run. He doesn't speak Polish? He does. But my wife insists that English should be his first language so we speak to him in English. How are you? Ok? Aren't you too young to smoke? And what's the right age? To smoke? None. You just die sooner. My old man smoked and look at him. Are you normal? I'm not. And it's his fault. I wouldn't want my kid to talk about me like that. Me neither. So, take care. Call me if you ever need a job. I won't need it. Then don't call. Who's there? Stop right there! What are we going to do with this? Officially Krzysztof wasn't working. I told you that already. The case had been investigated by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and their expert. You won't get any money. They have all the expensive lawyers. I wouldn't fight them, and I'm from here. What do you want? I... I can't even... afford for the funeral. How much? Three thousand euro. Are you building a pyramid or something? Take it. I agree, it's not fair. It's from the bribe fund. That's from me. What was he like? I don't know, he was... he was just like everybody else. He didn't talk much, he worked hard. I'd say he did his best. Did his best? And that's all? I knew him on an employer-employee basis, which means I really didn't know him at all. Like everybody else, they're not really here. It's very hard to get to know somebody when actually they're somewhere else. Why don't you try his room-mates? Where? Fucking police, fucking police, fucking police, fucking... What do you want? Yo, are you ok? What? I'm worried, you've not been at school, so I thought... I'm not at school because I'm in fucking Ireland. - What? - My father died. So I'm not really in the mood for nudes, sorry. Unless you want some pics from the cremation. And a tip: if you want to see my tits, do it in person. Good evening. I'm... Ola? Ola? Krzysztof's kid? That would be me. Careful with all that English, or they'll think you're the manager. - Hi. - Hi. Kiddo! Turn that off! Stop yelling, I'm watching a movie. You don't need to hear the dialogue in porn. - Dziad. - Ola. - Zbych. - Ola. - Hi. - Ola. Kiddo. Nice name. It's his 'stage name'. Have a seat. Hey, Chicken, clean up a bit. How are you holding up? Okay. Terrible accident. It's fucked up. Maybe we should have a small wake, or something? It would make my father happy. Good, I'll go and get the glasses. You look like him. I'm not sure it's a compliment. You have his eyes. Get a fucking grip, Zbych, you're getting all soppy. I told you not to swear. Fuck me, sorry. Did you sort out the body? The paperwork? We wanted to help, but... the board told us not to. Terrible accident. So? I'll just have the one. My wife will kill me, you know. I don't drink at all. - Dziad? - I can't. I'll drink, since such a pretty girl is asking. Let's make it quick though, I gotta get up at four. Don't get any ideas, Kiddo, this is Krzysztof's daughter. Krzysztof liked me. But I'm not sure that I do. Well then... To Krzysztof. Here's hoping that you're in a better place than we are. Look at this. He was a joker. So... another shot? He didn't leave much behind. Where are the rest of his things? - He took them with him. - Took them where? To the place he moved into. Fuck! Where is that? I don't know. He left some newspapers and books that he wanted me to read. Do you know her? She works at a hair salon. Where? Her name's Sara. Where? Ladies' Man - Art and Beauty. - Can I crash here? - Sure. If you get cold, you can join me. I'll think about it. What was he like? You know, my old man. How was it living with him? Fucking police, fucking police, fucking police, fucking... Hiya, do you have an appointment? No. Well, sorry, you'll have to wait then, princess. I'm in a bit of a hurry. That works. Come here, come here. - You wash her hair and I'll cut it, ok? - Ok. So how short would you like it? Very short. It's kind of cold out there for short hair. Where are you from? Here. Yeah, right. Romania. Romania. I'm from Poland. Let's wash your hair. Do you know anyone from Poland? No. Lay back. All right, all right. I'll finish here, princess. I'll finish here. Ok go home, you're scaring the customers. Alright, sorry about that. Are you ok? - Yes? - Yes. Where are you from? - What? - Where are you from? No, no, sit down, sit down. I thought you wanted your fucking hair cut? You're stealing my fucking towel! What's wrong? Didn't I wash your hair right, or what? I'm Krzysztof's daughter. What? He never mentioned his family, right? He did. Well, he never fucking mentioned you. Who are you? His girlfriend? His lover? I'm his friend. His friend? What do you want? I don't know, I just wanted to know. Now you know. - I want to talk. - About what? You want me to apologise or something? I just... wanted to find out something about him. I barely knew him. What's your name? What? I don't know your name. Ola. You're not mad at him? Not more than before. So... You're moving out? I can't afford an apartment alone. Could I take a look at his stuff? Why? Maybe... I could keep something? Something to remember? Sure. Everything's packed, there isn't much. Is... Is that... His? Yes. He likes to draw. Liked. He never told me. Maybe you never asked? So did you choose anything? No. I won't give you the picture. I couldn't do this to Mum. I have a question. Yes? Did he... have any money saved up? No. He had some savings, but he spent it on rent. He paid the bulk of it. So... There's nothing left? No. Not here. Grab these. Oh, look, look, These two are savage. Can I give you a hand, can I? Why so shy? Oh, you speak English, do ya? Come over and say hello, love. Are you going to live here? Yeah. For how long? A year, maybe two. It depends. Depends on what? On whether I finish the course. What course? A driving course? I'm taking a six-stage makeup course. I don't want to sweep hair for the rest of my life. Yeah, especially at that pervert's. It is how it is. How much is it for the course? Why, are you interested in make-up? Are you ok? OLA'S CAR So have you made a decision? Cremation. Oh that's good. That's a good choice. That's um... it's cheaper. It's faster and you can bring the urn with you on the plane. Really? You just need to list it as a 'special item'. Ok. Look, the whole procedure is going to take about four hours, so if you go to the Consulate now, you can get this done. Ok. How do you spell it again? My father's name? Yes. It's K, R, Z... Just maybe give it to me, it will be faster. Thank you. So you have to bring this with you. Look, I'm sorry for your loss. No, you're not. Excuse me? You are not sorry, it's just your job. That's true. But it's sad when somebody dies... you know, a decent guy. How do you know? What? That he was a decent guy? I don't. That's just something that you say. Wasn't he? Mum. I've sorted it. How? He had the money after all. Where? I found some cash in his stuff. How much? He'd put it aside for me. How much? It's all here. 3,500 euros, minus the cost of cremation and other expenses. You see, I told you. Yeah, I know. But I thought he lied to me. So that's good. We can use it to get a headstone. What? But Mum... We'll get one from black marble. Your dad would've liked that. Mum, it was supposed to be for me. It'll look good against the wall, with the trees and shade. - I'll ask the neighbour to play the violin. - Mum, it was supposed to be for me! Can't you just leave me alone? Wait here. What's happened? Where did you get it from? You stole it? My father left it to me. How much? Over two thousand. Enough to transport the body, right? He's already been cremated. I'm taking the urn with me. Will you buy it for me? What? For my birthday. So you figured you'd buy a car with what's left? No, you can buy it and keep it for me. I'll come back for it once I pass my driving test. Why don't you buy a car in Poland? With the steering wheel on the 'right' side? My mum has to think there was no choice, that dad had already bought it. Otherwise she won't let me and she'll spend all the money on the funeral. Leave me alone. My father promised me a car. There's a chance that he will keep his word for once. Once. Can't you see, it's a fucking wreck? That's all I can afford. Do you know that you are a perfect example of a Pole? What? You know why people here are working their asses off? For people like you, far away, who are waiting for the paychecks, who get fucking used to them and then they don't even remember who's sending them. They only remember the amount and date of the transfer. This is your father's money. For his funeral. He owes me something! You don't think you owe him anything? After all, he was your dad. - Daddy! - I'm coming! He would have wanted it. How do you know what he would want if you didn't even know his middle name was Sebastian? Go home. I'm sorry. No. Take it. Dad would have wanted it. It's your money. Finish the course, get a new job. I have a job. Not anymore. Sara, get your fucking friend and clean this up! Don't work for him anymore. Take it, it's from my Dad. Sara, what the fuck was that about? What the fuck was that about?! Get the fuck inside now! Get in there! Sara! So... this is it? This is it. So... till next time. It's just something you say, right? FOREVER IN OUR HEARTS Do you have it? This is a special favour for you. Thank you. Otherwise everyone will bring their loved ones in thermos flasks. I hope it's the last time. Thank you. Is there anything in particular you want me to say about him? What? About your dad. During the sermon? Not really. That he did his best. Should I say that? That he did what he could. Hi. Hey, open the door!
