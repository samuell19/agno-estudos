Massive quantities of radiation have apparently been released in an accident at the Chernobyl Power Station in the Ukraine. In an accident at the Chernobyl Power Station in the Ukraine. The Soviet version is this, one of the atomic reactors at the Chernobyl Atomic Power Plant in the city of Kyiv was damaged at the Chernobyl Atomic Power Plant in the city of Kyiv was damaged and there is speculation in Moscow that people were injured and may have died. The Soviets may have been fairly quick to acknowledge the accident The Soviets may have been fairly quick to acknowledge the accident because evidence in the form of mild and nuclear radiation have already reached beyond the Soviet borders to Scandinavia. Have already reached beyond the Soviet borders to Scandinavia. There are indications the accident could have happened several days ago, it would take that long for radiation to drift to Scandinavia and to make the political decision to announce it. And to make the political decision to announce it. You can be sure that the decision to, to disclose was made at the very highest level, undoubtedly by Gorbachev himself.

The Soviet press is paying significantly little attention to the disaster, newspapers carry only the brief official announcement inconspicuously placed.

The Soviet Union generating 11% of that nations electricity. Most of the larger Soviet plants differ in design to US reactors, the major difference is most Soviet nuclear plants do not have containment buildings, the thick concrete dome structures Americans are used to seeing built around US reactors. When the worst American nuclear accident occurred at When the worst American nuclear accident occurred at Three Mile Island most leaking radiation was kept inside the containment building. If as seems to be the case there was no containment If as seems to be the case there was no containment around the reactor as is the general- Can we be sure of that? What do you- I do not, I do not know. Do you think there's a containment building? I don't think that there is a containment building because the policy of Soviet atomic er, constructors was that the reactor's absolutely safe and so there is no need to have the reactor's absolutely safe and so there is no need to have this kind of precaution because it indicate possibility of disaster which Russian always can, considered er, absolutely impossible. Which Russian always can, considered er, absolutely impossible. So going to be clear about this, you're, you're going as far as to say you think it almost certain or just probable as to say you think it almost certain or just probable there was no protective shield around this reactor which appears to have melted down? No I think that there is no protection, protection shield No I think that there is no protection, protection shield around this reactor's certainly the case because the building as such indicate that there is no shield.

Well obviously if radioactivity got as far as Scandinavia how long, however long it took to get there, a great deal must have escaped however long it took to get there, a great deal must have escaped close to the site.
