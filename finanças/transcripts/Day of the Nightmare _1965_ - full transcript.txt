## [screaming] ## [engine idling] [boy] Bang, bang, bang! [boy 2] Bang, bang! [boy 3] You're dead, you're dead! [boys continue shouting "bang, bang"] ## [man on p.a.] Attention, please. All aboard this Continental Trailways southbound bus. This is your southbound bus to Long Beach, Laguna Beach, Oceanside, Del Mar, and San Diego. All aboard, please. ## [children laughing] ## [girl] Mrs. Crane! Mrs. Crane, Mrs. Crane! [woman] Susie, come back here. Oh, Susie, you know you're not supposed to leave the room without permission. It's my fault. I forgot to tell her good-bye. Honestly, Mrs. Crane, it's a pity you're only a volunteer teacher. The way the children adore you. And I adore them. With my husband away so much of the time, I don't know of another way I could spend my time more happily. Good-bye now. Good-bye. ## [car door opens] ## [house door opens] ## ## [doorknob rattling] ## [woman] There you are! Oh! [chuckles] Dorothy. I thought I heard you in the back. I didn't even hear you drive up. Oh, the wreck stalled as I was pulling into the driveway. You may have to push me out. Honestly, that car of yours. I don't know why Hoppy won't trade it in, unless it's symbolic. You know, he's never quite forgotten that he was born on the other side of the tracks. And poor me, I have to suffer for it. Oh, I feel so sorry for you. Come on, grab your hat. Edith is having a few of the girls over for pink lemonade. ## You have to. Come on, you know Edith's pink lemonade. No, no. You go on ahead. I, I don't feel like it. Jonathan's not back from Los Angeles? You know how long this has been going on. Weeks. Jonathan at his studio in Los Angeles, and me here all alone. Mm, well, that's just the trouble. You been staying around this place too long. You're coming with me. I better not. Jonathan might be calling. Oh, I'll have you back in plenty of time. Besides, it'll do you good to hear some real moaning and groaning. ## [insects chirping] [woman singing on TV] # And all I see is my man walking out on me # ## # This is the house that Jack built # [dog barking and yelping] # The little white house that Jack built # # For the happy young bride he once found... # [barking continues] Can't you stop that dog's yapping? ## Bad dog. Mommy doesn't want you barking like that. Mommy doesn't want you wasting those barks on that bad woman upstairs just because she's got a little dog upstairs that you like. Oh, yes, you do. I know you like that little dog upstairs. [laughing] Yes... I'm trying to watch this program, Bertha. ## Oh, Carl, she has to go potty. ## All right. Come on. Go for a walk with Daddy, honey. Make sure you take her all the way around the block. Maybe you'd like me to walk her down Wilshire Boulevard. Oh... [door opens and closes] [water running] [woman laughing] [man] If you don't keep away from her, I'm going to kill you! [woman] You'll never get rid of me, and you know it. You're trying my patience, Doris, I'm warning you. You can't have us both! It's either your wife or me, and I'm going to make sure it's me! [banging and struggling] [dog barking] [glass and dishes breaking] [barks] [struggling continues] [dog barks] I'm sorry, Doris. You made me. You gave me no choice. [dog barks] [growling and barking] Go away, Queenie, or I'll kill you, too. [thud, Queenie yelping] [banging and rolling] ## [engine starts] ## [song playing on TV in the distance] [trunk scraping] [insects chirping] [song continues faintly] [trunk scraping floor] [music continues on TV] [door opens and closes] # ...The little white house that Jack built # [turns off TV] Sleeping Beauty, I presume. Jonathan... I didn't know you were coming. [chuckles] Awake, beauty, and, uh, find a vase to put these in. They're the last of the season or is it the first of next season? Anyway, they're very rare and costly and not to be sniffed too much. I'll put them in water. [chuckles] Jonathan, are you all right? Why shouldn't I be? I hadn't heard from you and... Oh, just busy, sweetheart. I had to redo most of the sketches that I took in. You could've called, you know. I get very lonely here all by myself and, and frightened. I was only in Los Angeles. I've been going there ever since we were married. For a day or two at the most, but... Bobbie, look... I thought that... Oh, I, I didn't know what to think. It was nothing, sweetheart. Just that this past month or so, it's just, just some business problems. And for a while, it was touch and go at the agency. The new account that I've been working on, always crises. This time, they came all at once, that's all. That's all? That's all. I didn't know what to think. That you didn't love me or maybe there was another woman or that you were tired of our marriage. [chuckles] Just business, sweetheart. That's all. And now it's, it's all over. The office was very happy with the new sketches I took in. Now I'm going to stay home for a while. I'll go put the car away, and I'll be right in... Okay? [whispers] Okay. Don't put any wood on the fire till I get back. ## Bobbie? Here. Darling, in here. In here, in here. Relax, Dave, relax. I'm a photographer, not a magician. I can only be in one place at one time. Lieutenant's on the phone making noises. Yeah, Lieutenant. Where have I been? Well, I've been taking Elizabeth Taylor's picture for the cover of the "Police Gazette." Bless-ed, bless-ed. That's what I am. God has been good to me. Every one of my men has a sense of humor. You want to tell me something special? Yeah. Get me some pictures of the building, front and back. Three-dimensional, know what I mean? Yeah, photomural, sure. Bless you, Lieutenant. Your turn, Sarge. Yeah. Hello, Dave. Yeah, I got the fingerprint report. Nothing clear enough to identify. Mm-hmm. Wonderful, isn't it? First an alleged murder with an alleged victim with the alleged name of Doris Mayes by an alleged lover nobody can identify. I'll be praying for you, Dave. Thanks. That gives me a lot of confidence. Boy, this place is sure a mess. How much coverage do you want, Dave? Everything. Start over here. Who got killed, a midget? The dog. Gee, poor fella. Come in here for a second. Make sure you get a good clear shot of these drawers. Looks like they came out of a pretty good-size trunk. Neighbor saw a man taking a trunk out of here last night. Big enough to carry a body in? Aren't they all? No, her, her nose wasn't nearly that big. It was, um, kind of turned-up, you know, as if she had her nose in the air all the time. Uh, like, uh, this? Or more like this? No, like the other. How's it going? Pretty good. I think we might have something in a minute. Now, what about her hair? Well, she kind of wore it, uh... Wouldn't your husband be able to help us on this, Mrs. Worth? Oh, he doesn't see anything. All he watches is television. Night and day he's glued to that set. Well, what color was her hair? Uh, brown, I think. Carl, wasn't it brown? Well, I, uh... Uh, she wore her hair in kind of a page boy. Oh, I, I wonder what he did with her body. Oh, he was screaming and yelling something terrible at her. Probably hacked it up and dumped it into the river. They do that, don't they, Sergeant? It's happened. Shows you how far a man can go when he starts cheating on his wife. Ahh... Now, what about this, Mrs. Worth? Is that the woman? Well, it looks something like her. Mr. Worth? She was a little more, uh, blousy, but I guess it's her. Get copies of that made, then we'll cover the neighborhood. I'm gonna check the rest of the apartments. Okay. ## Cigar? Flown in from Rio only this morning. No, thanks. I might like the taste, and I can't afford it on my salary. Well, now, you were asking about Jonathan Crane? He's been on my staff as a commercial artist about, uh... why, it's over a year now. Really quite talented. Has he done something? Is he the kind of man that might do something? Sergeant, I run the art department, not the personnel department. But if you're looking for him... No, Just a few routine questions I'd like to ask him. Now, look, Sergeant, you don't come to a man's employer for routine answers. Thanks, I'll remember that when I write the new police manual. Touch?. Your secretary tells me that he hasn't been around for a few days. Have you any idea where he might be? Well, you know, he lives in La Jolla, but he has an apartment here in L.A. for his work. Is that customary? Well, yes, for freelance artists. You see, we have first call on him, but he takes assignments from other advertising agencies, too. Has anything happened to him? Not that we know of. Well, thanks, Miss Devi. By the way, may I have his home address? Oh, of course. [woman] Yes, Miss Devi. What's Mr. Crane's address in La Jolla? Mr. Crane is here, Miss Devi. He just came in. May I talk to him? Here? If you don't mind. No, no, not at all. You can go in now. I won't be long, sweetheart. Oh, Mr. Crane, what are they after you for? What? There's a police detective in there. He was asking some questions about you. Come clean, Mr. Crane. Who'd you kill? Oh, uh, you wouldn't know her. [laughing] You better come with me, Bobbie. Perhaps I'd better wait out here. Oh, come on, sweetheart. A wife can't testify against her husband anyway. [laughs] Mrs. Crane, it's been so long since you've come to see us. How nice. Thank you. We had some his-and-her shopping to do. This is Detective Sergeant Harmon. How do you do? If you'd, if you'd rather I waited outside... Not at all. I just would like to talk to your husband. About what? Look, why don't you make yourselves comfortable? Please, sit down and I have some ad checks that I have to do... There's no need for you to leave, Miss Devi, unless Mr. Crane prefers privacy. Well, I can't tell. I don't know what you're here about. Well, then, please, please sit down. We'd like to know what you did last Tuesday. Worked. Here? At my studio. I do most of my sketches in my apartment. Did you work all day? Except to drop some sketches off here for Miss Devi about noon for her approval. It was noon. It made me 20 minutes late for a lunch date. What about after work? I went home to La Jolla. About halfway there, I realized that I hadn't eaten, so I stopped and grabbed a bite. Then you weren't in your apartment between 7:00 and 7:30? He couldn't have been... he was home by 10:00. Your landlord gave me a list of the tenants. I'm asking the same question of them. Mr. Crane, have you ever seen this woman? No. No, I can't say that I have. Have you, Bobbie? W-why, no, never. I, I'm sure I've never seen her before. I'm sorry. She's your neighbor. Lives right across the court from you. You look into her apartment. Now he tells me. There's a possibility she may have been murdered. They found her with her head bashed in, I suppose. The usual question: accident or foul play? We don't have a head. As a matter of fact, we don't even have a body. But we do have two neighbors who heard her threatened by her, um, her lover. We had a dog, her dog, brutally killed. And we have a shambles of an apartment and we have a witness who saw a man drag a trunk out of the place. I wish I could help you. So do I. Well, thanks, anyway. Mrs. Crane... Miss Devi. No trouble at all, Sergeant. All right, Jonathan, let's see what goodies you've brought me. [clattering] Jonathan? Jonathan? Jonathan? ## What are you doing? Who are you? You sure got a nice collection of used things here. We're from the Good Deed Mission. You called for some stuff to be picked up. ## We knocked on the door, but you didn't answer. We figure we could find the stuff ourselves. You see, we don't get out this way until maybe next week again. Sorry if we woke you up, ma'am. Is this the stuff for us? Yes. There's a drive on this week. Truck that brings in the most gets a commendation. Here's the receipt. Receipt? For income tax. Oh. Yeah, you could take it off for charity. What about this? That's, uh... It's pretty old. Don't look to be much good. Leave this. I want to keep this. You want to keep this, lady, considering what a fancy house you got and all? I am not giving you permission to take the trunk. Okay, okay, lady. The trunk stays. But, uh, there might be some old junk inside that we could have. No, that's not for you. I could open it easy, just takes a screwdriver. You leave it alone. Marv. Don't bawl me out, will ya, Sam? You're not my boss. You make me feel ashamed, acting like we're scavengers or something. Well, thank you anyway, lady, for what we got at least. Sure... thank you, lady. ## [truck engine starts] [telephone ringing] [telephone still ringing] Hello. [Jonathan] Hello. Barbara? Yes. Did I wake you? I'm sorry. You were sleeping so soundly when I left that I didn't want to wake you. Where are you? San Diego. I had to pick up some paints. Barbara, are you still there? Y-Yes. Sweetheart, I have to go over to Coronado Island. The agency wants some sketches of a fishing village for a new sardine account. Sounds fishy to me. [laughs] Bobbie? Oh... yes, yes. Oh, I don't blame you, sweetheart. It was a bad joke. I'm going to be late, so don't wait dinner for me. Okay? Okay, okay. [door opens and closes] Good morning, Mrs. Crane. Good mor-morning, Sarah. Somethin' need fixin'? Not my vacuum, I hope. Oh, oh, no. Everything's just fine. Shall I start with the bedroom? Yes, yes, please. And then maybe we can get around to turnin' those mattresses today. Yes, we'll, we'll do that. [vacuum cleaner running] [vacuum cleaner stops] Oh, Mrs. Crane. Let me do that. Do what, Sarah? Looks like you're about to fix somethin'. You know, I've had three husbands who were all thumbs, so I've become quite a handyman. Wait... I'll come right out. It's, it's nothing important. Later maybe. I, I was just looking for something to do. Well, the beds are ready to be turned, if you'd like to give me a hand. There, all done. Now you run on along home, Sarah. I really shouldn't have let you stay so late. Mrs. Crane, if I didn't know better, I could swear that you've been trying to get rid of me ever since 5:30. Now, how can you say that, Sarah? You know, I really do appreciate you having dinner with me, although I'm not sure I should've let you after you put in such a long day. Oh, it's been fun. See you tomorrow. Oh, uh, you gonna wait up for Mr. Crane? [clicks tongue] No, Sarah. He won't be back for hours yet, and I am tired. Me too. Good night. Good night, Sarah. [door opens and closes] ## ## ## Hi. What are you doin' out here? Oh, I'm just so excited, I couldn't even stop to call and warn you that I was comin' over. I just had to show it to someone. Look. Oh, Barb, isn't it gorgeous? It was a surprise. I guess I complained so much about the old car that Hoppy just had to trade it in out of self-preservation. It's beautiful. Come on, I'll give you a sample. I don't think so. Oh, come on. Finish what you were doing. I'll wait. Oh, I was just looking for something. I, I don't think I better. Jonathan will be coming in a while. Bingo. You've got somethin' special goin' tonight, haven't ya? What is it, anniversary? Birthday. Aha! You're pregnant and you're gonna spring it on him tonight. Go home, you nut. Oh, all right. I'll call you first thing in the morning and you can tell me all about it. Or at least the parts you can tell me about. See ya. ## Missing Persons should be handling this, not Homicide. Lieutenant, you seem to forget. The neighbors heard a violent argument. And what about that trunk that's missing and the dead dog? Yeah, yeah, I know. Anybody that kicks a dog to death has got to be a nut. So what are we supposed to do, round up every nut in town? What bothers me is this... the day after Doris Mayes moved into her apartment, Jonathan Crane rented one right across the court from her. Now, it could be nothing and it could be they were playing house. Bless-ed, bless-ed. God has given me a detective who writes "True Confession" stories. Anyway, I'm going down to La Jolla and have a talk with Mrs. Crane. I may not come back with much, but I'll know more than I do now, that's for sure. Bon voyage, David. [telephone rings] Yeah, Lieutenant Cody speaking. [woman on p.a.] United Airlines Mainliner Sailcruiser Flight 35 to Hawaii for Honolulu now boarding at United Concourse 622. All aboard Flight 35, please. Mrs. Crane. I beg your pardon? Detective Harmon. We met the other day in Miss Devi's office. This is... I'm, uh, Detective Smith. How about a cup of coffee? No, no, thank you. I'm waiting for someone. Flight from L.A.? Yes. It's not due in for ten minutes. How about it, huh? One cup before your husband arrives. I'm meeting my father-in-law. I'd rather not, thank you. Mrs. Crane, please. We made the drive down here just to see you. To see me? That's right. We went to your house. Your maid told us we'd find you here. What on earth do you want with me? When I showed this to your husband, I thought you recognized her. Whatever gave you that idea? Frankly, when you first looked at it, I thought you seemed to know her. Just for a moment, but I, I don't know her. I'm gonna check with the office. How long have you and Mr. Crane been married? Two years, but I don't know what that has to do with anything. And it's your home that you and your husband live in. I mean, your family left it to you. You certainly have done a great deal of checking up on us, haven't you, Sergeant? Your husband's been spending a great deal of his time in L.A., away from you. He happens to work there. Mrs. Crane, have you and your husband ever been separated? Mrs. Crane. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you, but there are a number of coincidences. Your husband hasn't been home from Los Angeles in two weeks. Then why don't you arrest him? Barbara, my dear. Oh, there you are. Am I interrupting something? Oh, no, no. The car's in the parking lot. Right. You recognize him? Yeah, the D.A. brings him in every once in a while on criminal cases. Crane, Dr. Philip Crane, psychiatrist. Do you believe Jonathan's involved? No, of course not. But you're afraid to ask him. I can't punish him, you know. I can't put him across my knee and spank him if he has been involved in an extramarital affair. Frankly, I have no right to cast the first stone. No one's asking you to punish him. He may need your help. Is the trunk in there? Yes. Is this it? Yes. It's locked. Do you have a key? I opened it with a screwdriver. I'll get it. ## [surf crashing] That... that's not... That, that's not it! Did you find them? No. You looked everywhere? I think so. I did see them in the trunk. Sometimes... uh, often we connect two things that are similar but not identical. I know what I saw and I saw another portrait of her in the trunk. Well, not necessarily the same trunk the police claim a man was seen carrying out of her apartment. Coincidence? The police seem to think that her body was in the trunk. Was there a body in the trunk when you opened it? No. Just, just some clothes and a sketch. I always take it black. I guess it's because my father always took it black. You know, most of our attitudes are reflective. Jonathan was upset at my unfaithfulness to his mother. Oh, she wasn't. We'd already agreed that our marriage was hopeless. We only stayed together because of the boy. A mistake that I should've at least recognized professionally, but that's the way she wanted it. Do you really think that's any excuse for Jonathan's conduct? I'm just trying to show you a possible explanation that has nothing to do with Jonathan's loving you. He couldn't love me and... Just as I can show you an explanation for what you saw. There are more explanations than you can imagine. An obviously kept woman, missing or murdered, who lives across from Jonathan. If you didn't make a connection, it would be unusual. Yet whatever you do might jeopardize your marriage, something you don't want. And so I run to you and that's so childish. And so adult. It's almost 5:00. I have to get back. I have a raft of paperwork. I'll get my coat. I, I wouldn't want you to miss your plane. ## ## [shrieking] Ohh! ## Ohh! ## [gasping nervously] [gasping] ## ## ## [woman] Number, please. Long distance. Long... long distance, please. This is long distance. I want to call Los Angeles. It's an emergency. I, I want to call Los Angeles. What number are you calling in Los Angeles, ma'am? The police department. Sergeant Harmon at the police department. Would he be at headquarters, ma'am? Yes... no. I don't know! Would you just call the headquarters, anything, anywhere? Just do it. One moment, please. Oh, please hurry. For God's sake, please help me. [razor buzzing] [intercom buzzes] Can't you let a man shave in peace? [man] Sorry, Lieutenant. Somebody's calling long distance, looking for Sergeant Harmon. Who? A dame... Barbara Crane. Hello? Yeah, put her on. Please, I must speak to Sergeant Harmon. That woman, she, she got into my house. She tried to kill me. Now, slow down, Mrs. Crane. Where are you calling from? Give me the name of the motel. I know... I know she might be following you, but she won't attack you right there in front of witnesses. Now, look, you still didn't tell me the name of the motel. Uh-huh, the Sierra Paloma. Okay. Okay, now listen. You go in there and get yourself a room and wait right there, okay? It was Doris Mayes. I recognized her from the sketch. Then she must've been at the house when you got back from the airport. She came at me with a knife, so I ran, and she ran after me. You know, she knew the house almost as well as I did. Well, that gives us something. She knew the house, so she must've been there before. But that's impossible. I, I told you, she's a total stranger. You think I'm imagining all this? Not necessarily, but she's not there now. We had the local police check the house after you phoned. You can go home now. No. We'll post men all around the house. I'd rather stay right here. What'll your husband say when he comes home and finds you gone? Oh, he'll spend the night in Los Angeles. I've gotten used to that. Your marriage is in trouble, isn't it? I don't know. I'd like to believe that it isn't. See, one minute, he's so, so thoughtful and warm and, and considerate. And, and... [sobs quietly] All right, you can stay here tonight. I'll hang around... you'll be safe. Why? Why me? Why would she want to kill me? It's all so crazy. People go crazy. Every day, people go crazy. ## I told you to leave her alone. You are not to go near her again. I asked you not to. You weren't to interfere. You were to go away. You were dead. Dead. You're dead. Now stay dead. Stay dead. Stay dead... dead. Dead... dead! That's perfectly all right. Any time at all. Send him in, Sally. Dr. Crane. Well, I hope this is a professional visit, Sergeant. Yours, not mine. It's police business. Well, sit down, sit down. What's the problem? I was just wondering if, if you knew this woman. Should I? You might've come in contact with her as a patient or in a state hospital. No, I don't know this woman. I think I can safely say I've never met her. Her name is Doris Mayes and she is missing. Does the name mean anything to you? No, I can't say that it does. Thanks for your time, Doc. Oh, you're welcome. Anytime, Sergeant. [door opens and closes] Your horse ran out of the money. I can see it in your face. Oh, the doc's in this somewhere. The question is where? Well, all we can do is just keep cherchezin' la femme and find Doris Mayes, and we'll have all the answers. Yeah, but will we find her before she murders someone? Well, the La Jolla police will keep their eye on the Crane house, so what do we got to worry? Well, Mrs. Crane is safe enough, but what about Jonathan? That's the worry. [Philip] Jonathan? Good morning, Jonathan. What are you doing here? Well, I was in La Jolla yesterday on business and stopped by the house. Are you all right? Yes, of course. Barbara told me I'd find you here. I thought I'd stop by and see you. It's a bit late for that, isn't it? Oh, I don't think so. Is that your professional opinion? Therapy, cold baths... shock treatment. But never too late. Well, I don't need a doctor. Well, I didn't come as a doctor. Or a father. I don't need you. Do you understand that? I don't need you. Have dinner with me tonight. I have to go home to La Jolla. Barbara won't mind. Call her, tell her you're seeing me. Why? What did Barbara tell you? About the police and the missing woman. Oh. It's just that they, they've upset her. There's nothing to it. They're always poking their noses about. I told her that. Why did you come now? Where were you when I needed you? When I wanted you? It's too late now. We don't even know each other. Perhaps we never did. Here's my address in case you change your mind. Come tonight, any time after 7:00. Please, Jonathan. Johnny, please. [sobbing] I want you. Help me. Help me, Daddy. Help me. ## ## [door opens and closes] [footsteps approach] Jonathan? Jonathan? Yes? Yes, can I help you? [feminine voice] Dr. Crane. Yes. Doris Mayes? Yes. Jonathan? Is Jonathan with you? No. Is this some kind of a joke? You're trying to come between us. ## Jonathan! [grunts] Jonathan is not here. I didn't think it would be you. I thought it would be her. I couldn't let you come between us. Jonathan has always wanted you. Your love. [weakly] What have I done to you, Jonathan? What have I done? ## [Philip, weakly] I, I saw it in his face just before he stabbed me. He needs help. Extreme schizophrenic. My poor, poor... [groans, stops] That's it, Dave. The whole tape. It's a pity Crane didn't hang on a minute longer. He might've told us who Doris Mayes is. I mean, the other half of Doris Mayes. [alarm buzzing] [turns off alarm] [vehicle approaches] Jonathan. Jonathan? What is it? I just heard a car drive up. So? [doorbell rings] Do you want to go out and see who it is? Huh? Oh. [doorbell rings] Yes? May we come in? Now I suppose you've come to search the house. It's about your father. What about my father? He was murdered last night. Murdered? [falls with loud thump] Bring her in here. Would you get some water? What... what... what happened? You fainted, sweetheart. It's all right. Here. There. Jonathan... Please, darling. Please, you'll only upset yourself. It was her. She did it... she killed him. Mrs. Crane, please, don't think about it now. But I know she did it. She was looking for him that day. Mrs. Crane... That's why she was here the same day he was. Please... now try, try to get some rest, huh? D-don't leave. Please don't leave. All right. We better let her get some rest. I'll heat up some coffee. We'll be close by. Thank you... thank you. Sergeant. Thanks. Sergeant... my father and I were not very close. Not for a long time. I'm sorry, of course, but that's all. Your father was stabbed to death by a woman. The other day, your wife was attacked by that same woman. Doris Mayes. Doris Mayes? Your wife also thinks she saw some sketches of Doris Mayes in your portfolio. I think she did. And I think you know her. All right... I do. You sure took your time getting around to admitting it. I met her with my father. Coincidence, I guess you would call it. That he had set her up in a place right across from mine. Met them on the street one day. My father thought it was amusing that we should be neighbors. He had very little conscience about it. I guess he was luckier than most. Anyway, I shouldn't have expected him to be embarrassed. He wasn't when my mother was alive and there's less reason to be now. What about the sketches? Oh. Well, you see, I don't use live models. She has an interesting face. It stuck with me. When I needed a woman's face, it came to mind. Why didn't you tell us about this, even when you knew she was missing? He was still my father. And now he's dead. Yes. Shouldn't have done it, of course, but once emotions are involved, when you're being misused... It isn't being very rational, is it? [slow organ music playing] Friends and relatives of Dr. Philip Crane, this way, please. You may pay your respects in Room 2. It is kind of spooky staking out a funeral parlor. I don't like it. Well, do something. Keep busy. I'm gonna satisfy my curiosity. Killed the cat. Very funny. Friends and relatives of Dr. Philip Crane, this way, please. You may pay your respects in Room 2. Pretty good turnout you got here. I'll thank you to be more discreet. It's too obvious and embarrassing to our guests. Well, sorry. Stick and stones will break my bones, but names will never get you my business. [organ music continues] Jonathan? Are you out there, Jonathan? ## [screaming] ## [screaming and sobbing] What happened? Well, I don't know. I was in there with my mother and, and this girl came in. She must've gotten the wrong room. She became hysterical. [sobbing and shuddering] [gasps, moans] ## She's sedated now. Just let her rest. I'll see her tomorrow. Thank you, Dr. Siegel. Sure. I'll be back in the morning. Sergeant. Stay away. Stay away from my wife. From me. Stay away before you cause more damage. Nobody's trying to cause any damage. I'm just doing my job. Yes... I know. [door opens and closes] ## She's asleep. She's asleep, Doris. What do I do? What do we do now? Doris? Doris... Speak to me, Doris. Please. Doris? Doris... I have to see you. I want to be with you. Doris. Doris. I must see you. You know we must decide what to do. Doris? I hear you, Doris. We'll be together soon. Soon, Doris. Wait for me. I can't be away from you any longer. ## [telephone rings] ## Jonathan? ## ## ## [siren wailing] ## [clattering] Jonathan? [feminine voice] Stop fidgeting. I'll be ready in a moment. Calling in the middle of the night. Mmm, it's so sweet to be wanted. I do wish it was more for myself and less concerned with Barbara. I'm lonely, too, sweetheart. But only for a little while longer. ## I know it's difficult being apart. No, Barbara won't cause any trouble. I've assured you of that... Barbara won't be hurt. I'll... Oh, dear. I wasn't expecting you. I suppose you thought you'd find Jonathan here. Well, you won't. He doesn't face up to things. He's weak. I had a very difficult time winning him away from you. Well, I suppose it's best that we have it out. You look... You do present a problem, you know. You always have. Personally, I was prepared to take some action from the beginning, but Jonathan... Jonathan... You do frighten him. He never was what you'd call happy with you. Jonathan, what on earth is wrong with you? Please don't shout. Why? Why are you pretending to be, to be this way? We are past pretending. Jonathan, stop it! You're becoming hysterical. Jonathan, stop this. Jonathan! Please, Jonathan, stop it. ## Please, please don't kill me, Jonathan. Please! Crane. Crane! Grab him, Smith! What'll they do to him? That'll be up to the courts to decide, but he's sick and the law will take that into account. [sobbing] Come on. Come on, I'll get you home in a squad car. Look after her. She's headed for the amusement pavilion! Hey, lady, we're closed! ## Down the ramp! ## ## [screaming] ## [siren wailing] ## [boat engine starting] Crane! ## [screaming] ## [roaring and snarling]
