So, Take is hi sent you? You, too? I... He's my second. - Kill them both! I requested a one to one duel. Hanada, shoot anyone who interferes. TSURUTA Koji Directed by OZAWA Shigehiro You're strange. Why is that? You're good enough not to have to do other's dirty work. You should have just shot him. I have my pride as a yakuza. I want everything to be fair and aboveboard. Hey, Hana! Hey, Kozue. I'm glad we meet again! - Ma'am! - I'm going into service. I have to go on a trip, too. Oh. Then I won't see you again? You be careful of the water in a strange place. You know how you are. Broiled scorpion is good for bed-wetting. Oh no! I don't need that! Because I'm know I'm the only one for you. Ma'am, here you are. Excuse me. You can take off anywhere you please. But, my boss said I should travel and get more experience. I want to apprentice under you. Please take me on. No. Please take me with you. I'll cook, sew, wash, anything! Please! Kobuchizawa Station! Thank you. You're welcome. You must be tired, Mom. - Thanks. Ma'am! I envy them. IMAICHI CITY, TOCHIGI IMAICHI CITY, TOCHIGI I'm done. IMAICHI CITY, TOCHIGI IMAICHI CITY, TOCHIGI Open the cards! Open the cards! Here we go! I'm done! Are you done? Open the cards! Thank you. I'll be leaving now. You're very good. - So are you. Please deal the next round. Who's she? The innkeeper says her name is Onatsu. She's been staying here with her gambler father. Miss, you shouldn't sleep there. She has a fever! Call the doctor! The doctor told me... This could turn into pneumonia. Where is her father? Ma'am... Maybe she's been abandoned? No... I don't think so. My dad was a traveling gambler. He'd leave me at the inn and go gambling. One day he didn't come back. He participated in a fight... and got killed. In the morning, a stranger came to get me. He was the boss of the yakuza there. Ma'am, why don't you rest? I'll watch over her. I feel sorry for her. Until her father returns, I will stay with her. Dad! Dad... Your father's coming back soon. So go to sleep. Miss Hayami! You know what we want. Come with us. You cut off our boss' arm and killed our second. If we don't kill you, we can't go back! Die! Hey, all of you against a woman?! Thank you for saving my life. I am Hayami Komako. My name is Tsukuba Tsuneji. Pleased to meet you. Where are you going? - To the Nishiura Inn. Nishiura Inn? - Yes. And who is ill? Yes... Onatsu! Onatsu? Her fever's come down and she just got to seep. I see. Thank you for taking care of her. Onatsu. Dad. Don't get up. I'm sorry to leave you all alone. Forgive me. The lady watched over me all last night. I see. I'll be going now. Thank you. Onatsu, I'll see you. Onatsu. I won't go anywhere. TOSHO-GU SHRINE Auntie, quickly! Welcome. What will it be? - Sweet saké, please. Can I go down to the river? Sure, but be careful. Okay, let's go Uncle. - But I... Hurry! She's really attached to you. She must have been lonely without her mother. I hear you're looking for your mother? Yes. My mother had a very hard life. It's been 15 years since then... Ma, where are you going? Ma! Ma, take me with you! You be a good girl and wait for me. I will come back soon. When's soon? If you won't say, I'll go with you. I really will be back soon. Ma! KAMEIDO PLEASURE DISTRICT Otaki's not here anymore. You won't understand but her debt was bought up by a man. The only thing I remember about her is the birthmark on her right wrist... and her name, Otaki. Where and how is she... I want to see her. Too sappy for a yakuza, aren't 1? I wish that one day... you will find your true happiness. Hello. - You're late! Where's our guest? Oh here you are. Come this way. Boss! Sorry, I'm late. There's been an incident, Tsune. Tonight we have to have a showdown with the Kamiya family. Boss, you invited me into your family once. I've been busy with my daughter but I'll help you any way I can. You know attacking first always is the best. I'm thinking of sending out a kamikaze group. Kamikaze? - Yes. We can't win in a fair fight. So when it gets dark, we send six of our best men to try to kill Kamiya only. How about it? What will happen to Onatsu? I understand your position but what about Onatsu? I want to return her to her grandparents. And where are they? In Kakei Hot Springs, 3 miles from Nagano. Onatsu's mother Sugi was the only daughter of Sawatari, one of the 3 hot spring managers. She came with me against her parents wishes and endured many hardships and finally died from tuberculosis. I was on my way to return Onatsu to them. And what is the favor you're asking me for? I'm not sure if I'll come out of this alive. So I want you to take her to Kakei. Take Onatsu to Kakei? Yes. The Sawatari will understand if you show them this. I was determined to send Onatsu back with money. This is what I saved from working in gambling halls. So when I met you... All right... I will take Onatsu back to Sawatari. I swear on my life. Thank you. Dad! Dad? In here. Onatsu... I have to go away on business. So Auntie Okoma will take you to your grandpa's. What about you, Dad? When I'm done, I'll come right away. So you go ahead of me. All right? Onatsu... You do what grandma and grandpa tell you to. Dad! It's raid!! ZENKO-JI TEMPLE I got it from Zenkou-ji Temple. There were lots so they won't miss one. The carriage to Kakei is about to depart! Take this as a gift... Damn you! Oh, it's you! Why are you here? The restaurant I went to work for wanted me to be a prostitute. I got mad so I got the john drunk stole his wallet and ran away. You're really a strong girl! Sure am! I am now the owner of a store. Store? - Yes! See? It's a food cart. Soon I'll have dozens of them and become a woman president. So, why don't you join me? I'll make you vice-president. Vice-president? - Yes, me, president. Hanada, stay here with her. Ma'am, please take me! - Stop it! Let go! Ma'am! Good bye, Uncle! Ma'am, take me with you! Ma'am! Ma'am, be well! Hey, don't look like that! You have a cute girl right here! Shut up! Get out of the way! CONSTRUCTION ISHIWARI FAMILY KAKEI HOT SPRINGS Oh, Mr. Sawatari. Everything was so sudden. My husband's suicide... Our land and fortune taken away. The springs have been around sins the Tokugawa era. I, Narusawa-ya and Shikano-ya made it what it is today. Are you all right? What is this? - The family altar. It must be heavy. There's one thing I'm worried about. Our hot springs rights have gone to Ishiwari. Don't worry. Shikano Yu and I will carry on us before. Okay. You still here? You were supposed to have vacated already. We're leaving right now. Let's go, Shohei. Don't cry! Don't hit me! Stop it! He's only a child! Why you...! - That's enough! If you hurt Mr. Sawatari, the boss will be mad. Shohei! - Mom! Get out of here! - Now! Get moving! SAWATARI INN We don't allow yakuza. Grandpa, you don't have to be rude. I came about your daughter... You have news of our Sugi? Where is she now? Our child... dead? Sugi...! Grandma! No need to cry. When she left, we decided she was no child of ours. Sorry for your trouble. We don't know her. Don't you want to meet your granddaughter? What? Sugi has a child? Yes. I brought her at the request of her father. She's waiting by the bridge right now. Her name is Onatsu, she's a very good girl. Gramps? Although he doesn't want to part with her, Onatsu's father thinks she's better off here. I don't care. Please leave! Please understand her father's feelings. There's no other place for Onatsu to go. Please let her stay here. Your dead daughter would have wanted that. Grandpa? Do as you wish! Yes, I will. How old are you? Eight. What's your mother's name? Sugi, but she died. You won't be lonely. Grandma will take care of you. Grandma? - Yes. I'm your grandma. Such a good girl! Please forgive the stubborn old man. Although he acts tough, in reality... Now that I'm one of the hot springs managers. I want to have a party for the innkeepers. I'd like you to come. Ishiwari, I've heard what you did to get the rights. I hope you won't stoop to such tactics anymore? Sure, sure. I like things to be peaceful. Later, then. Which family do you belong to? Excuse me, but what about you? Oh, sorry. I should have said, first. My name's Ishiwari. Here is my official greeting. I am Hayami Komako, aka Tsumakoi Okoma. I have no parents nor children. I am still traveling to get experience. Please remember my face. That was a good greeting. I like that. Won't you stay with us? I'm sorry but I have to decline. What? The Boss is asking you politely. You haven't taught your people manners. What's it to you? - Enough, let's go! Go! Onatsu! She's such a good girl. Oh, wait! I'm sorry for what I said before. Please, stay with us as long as you like. Please. Please. - Auntie, don't go. Welcome home! The problem is Sawatari. Perhaps we'll need to put pressure on him. By the way, that Okoma is stating with Sawatari. She brought Sawatari's granddaughter back so they're treating her like a hero. Sawatari has a grandchild? - Yes. She's a traveler. She'll leave in a while. But she's a looker. She's out of your league. I'll be leaving now. Ma'am. Otaki, you're the proprietress now. You must do your best. Otaki, I'm talking to you! I'm sorry. You were dying 15 years ago. If I hadn't bought you up, you would be long gone. You good for nothing! Wait! Please stop! Who are you? We reserved your best room by phone. What is your name? Ninomiya Tokuhei. That's my real name. - Ninomiya... Please wait! - Stop! Hey, bring the saké! What are you doing?! Bring saké! It's really noisy next door. - Sure is. Oooh, it stinks! Did you pass gas? - No, must be you. No, it must be you. - No way! Cut it out! - You don't understand. I can't drink cheap saké like this! Bring me something better! Hey! Let's sing! It really is loud next door. Don't worry about it. Why don't we just go to bed? With this racket? Here, drink this. Come on. What are you doing? Hurry! Hey, what the... - Who are you? You? - We're newlyweds. Hey, don't act so lovey dovey! What? I'm gonna give you one. My wife's strong. Are you all right? - I'm fine. I'll just... Oh, he's strong! - Don't say that about another man! Welcome back. - Master... Master! I know who's behind this! Oriku, bring my sword! A moment, please. I'll handle this. Please take Onatsu outside. Who are you? This is a legitimate business. Please leave! - You're kidding! I said leave! You tell Ishiwari. If you're a yakuza, don't bother the townsfolk. Watch out! Okoma, thank you. I can't forgive him! Damn Ishiwari! Idiot! So you just ran away?! Slit your belly! There are only six bullets in a revolver. Seven of you go after her and the last one kills! Don't you have the guts to do that? You fool! That bitch! She has it coming! Dear, please don't touch that girl... Shut up! Kakei Hot Springs is mine. You stay out of this! You go home first. I'll come later. Hello!! Good afternoon! Anyone home? Oh, Mr. Nan the traveling medicine man. You're late. It took longer than expected. I caught a cold and was in bed. None of the medicines worked. Hello, Nan. - I'm glad you're looking well. You have a big daughter. She wasn't here when I was here last year. It must have been a hard birth. A little something for you. - Thank you. You do like this and blow it up... Use one or both hands and bounce it like this... Ooops! How's the medicine supply? Let me have a look. Oh' you're low on some of them. We have a new one this year. Take this and your cold will be gone. This world is changing... Speaking of change, Narusawa-ya has a new proprietress. Hear she's come up in this world. In China we have a saying... woman's life depends on a man. The madam's name is Otaki. Otaki? - Yes. They say you can't stop people from gossiping. Just between us, she was a prostitute. She was sold to Kameido leaving a little girl, where she was living a sad life. Then Mr. Ishiwari forced her to go with him. But you must say it's a huge step up in life. But people are jealous so they talk. In China they say a male gossip is not good... Oh, I'm a man. I have to find a pill for gossips. You wanted to see me? My name is Hayami Komako. Could you tell me your name? It's Taki. Did you have a daughter by Hayami Tatsugoro? No. I don't know any Hayami. I never had a child. Madam, please! I heard your name is Taki. That's the name of my mother. It's the same name and history with my mother. I remember that birthmark on your right wrist. Madam, you are my mother! Isn't that right? I don't know what you are talking about. I have a patron named Ishiwari. I have a very good life with him. Why are you making these wild accusations? I'm not your mother. You must leave this town at once. Swear on this talisman... That you're not my mother. Madam. Listen to my story. I hear my mom sold herself to a brothel for the sake of my father and me. My father died when I was ten. Since then I've made my way by myself. The family boss took me in and I survived to adulthood. But I've always worried about my mother. I resented her when I was little... But since I knew the truth, I pity her. I'm sorry I resented her. I hope she is happy. But if not... That's why I've been looking for her. If my mom is happy... I won't intrude on that. If she's happy... That's all I want to know. If I could see her again... I want to call her mother! And I want her to call me daughter. You're crying! Then you must be... Stop it! It was such a sad story... Now, go. If Ishiwari comes here, there will be trouble. You went against Ishiwari. He'll either cripple you or kill you. Then your mother will be so sad. So take this and get out of here. Please! If I knew my mother was like this... Madam, excuse me. You're late! Where were you? It's none of your business! Ma'am, you're drinking! Celebrating? I should leave this town. Don't say that! Now that I finally have him! You, shut up! Ma'am, let's go on the road again. I really enjoyed our travel together. Water! Here! - I'm dying! What did you do? You just go on that trip of yours! Sure will, damn it! This time she'll take me in. Then I'll get this fancy tattoo, damn it. We can't find Miss Natsu. Isn't she inside? She's not here! The river! She might have fallen in! Please go look. - Okay! Onatsu is missing? Yes, she was gone in an instant. This is Sawatari Inn. What? I'll let you hear her voice. Say Grand pal! - Grandpa! Throw her into the warehouse. I'll exchange her for the hot spring rights. I'll draw up the papers. Just bring the chop. All right. Where should I go? To Matsukawa bridge at 12:00. Someone will be there. Your granddaughter's life is at stake. And come alone. If you call the police, she's dead! Where is Onatsu? I don't know. Mr. Sawatari... If you give him the hot spring rights, what will happen to your inn? Do you really want him to do what he pleases? I know. But there's no other way to save Onatsu. If something happens to Onatsu... Let me go. I promise to bring Onatsu back safely. I have an idea. All right. A Hayami Komako is here to see you. Why does she want to see you? Shall I kill her? Bring her to the living room. We can't have an incident now. Just pretend you know nothing. We'll be listening from the next room. If she knows something, we'll come in and kill her! You know what to do! Madam, I swore never to come here again. Do you know where Ishiwari is holding Mr. Sawatari's granddaughter? When I meet her, she had lost her mother and was traveling with her gambler father. The sight of her waiting at the inn for her father... made me think of me when I was little. I don't want her to grow up like me. Please understand! I don't know! I really don't know where she is. Please go! Please, leave now! Komako! What's your relationship with Okoma? Talk woman! We shouldn't bring Sawatari here. Boss, there's a mill near Matsukawa Bridge. It's out of the way. Okoma won't find it. All right! But just on the off chance, take a lot of men and guard it well. I have to a leak! I'll be back shortly! Madam. - The boss wants you. I'll watch the kid. Hurry. You must be hungry. Eat this. I'll take you home. Let's go. Madam, what are you doing? It's all right. - But this kid is... Hey, someone! Come quick! Auntie! Auntie! Don't cry! Auntie! Give me that! There's something between you and Okoma! How can you use an innocent child? Shut up! Don't butt into my business! Take her with the kid. She's insurance if Okoma ever finds out. Hurry! Tell me where you're holding the child. - I don't know. Where are those men going? - I don't know that either. I'll shoot if you don't talk! I'll talk! The guys went to the mill near Matsukawa Bridge. Ma'am, please let me help you. No, you go home! - But, Ma'am! Come over here! Is the boss here yet? Is everything okay? Auntie! What happened? - She tried to help me. But we got caught. I'm sorry I lied. She was in my house. But Ishiwari was listening next door. Komako, forgive me. Mother! Mother! Komako! Mother, let's go. Boss! Boss! - Boss! Okoma came to the office! - What? She must be here by now. - You idiot! I'm sorry! You...! You think you'll get away with this? Shut up! You'll be ostracized by other yakuza for using such a dirty trick. Mother... Look out! Mother! Auntie! Mother, hang in there! Stay by my side! Go head her off! Mother! Ma'am, I stole the carriage! Take my Mom and Onatsu. Ma'am! Mother! Get them! - Damn it! Mother, are you all right?! Komako... Forgive me. Mother! Mother! Auntie! - Mother! Don't die! I finally found you! Mother! Auntie! Mother! A yakuza's life is hell. Not only are we affected but our families, too. Hanada... You must make Kozue happy. Okay, I understand. We also need to make an example of her. We will help. - Thank you. But, when we kill her, you must obey our orders. Hey, Kurou! Thanks again. That was a fortunate coincidence. Boss, let's use them. We'll make them set fire to the Sawatari Inn. Then they kill Okoma. And have them kill Sawatari, as well. One... Let me try... One... One... - Grandpa, you're no good. Dad! Dad! I saw my father! - Tsukuba? Tsukuba! Tsukuba! Dad! - Tsukuba! Tsukuba! - Dad! Tsukuba! Tsukuba? Thanks for your help. Tsukuba, I'm glad you're safe. I wasn't going to see Onatsu again but I was worried about her and here I am. It looks like she's been well taken care of. I'm relieved. Thank you. I'll go back out on my journey. And I'll make sure to inquire about your mom. You said her name was Otaki? Yes. Thank you. But I was able to meet her. Really? - Yes. Oh, that's great! That's a load off my mind. We probably won't meet again. Good bye. Oh... Yes? Please take care. Thank you. Did you hear? Sawatari's granddaughter was kidnapped by Ishiwari. I know. God knows what he'll do next. If he isn't stopped, he'll ruin this town. God, I hate the yakuza. Mr. Sawatari! - Fire! Fire! Mr. Sawatari! Tsukuba! Mr. Sawatari, are you okay? Take care of him. Grandpa, don't die. Don't die. Don't worry. Grandpa won't die. Until I see you grow up and married. Grandpa... It's time for bed. Onatsu. Onatsu. Before that you must pray... For Okoma's mother who gave her life for you. Could I please pray for her? I'm sorry your mother died for Onatsu, when you had just found her. Tsukuba, please, don't. But why didn't you tell me? I almost left without knowing. Tsukuba. I'm a yakuza to the core. I'll make things right. I thank you for your kind words. But this is my fight, I have to do this. Okoma. I'll go with you. "We're like two fallen leaves "blown together by the wind. "I have no regrets if I die. "But until we reach the River Styx, "I want to walk along side you. "That's the life of a female yakuza." I'll take care of them. You go get Ishiwari. Bastard! Ishiwari! Ishiwari! Ishiwari! Did you get him? - I can't find him! Look out! Ishiwari! Tsukuba! - Don't worry about me! Go get Ishiwari! Quickly! Stop her! Don't kill me! Let me go! - Die! Tsukuba! Tsukuba, don't die! Ishiwari? Thanks to you, I got him. That's good. Tsukuba, you mustn't die! Tsukuba! Okoma... This... This is the way it should be. Tsukuba! "The first wrong step “leads to the next and the next wrong steps in life. "Trying not to think this is my fate, "try to get up wiping my tears “and walk on as the cold wind blows. "Such is the life of a female yakuza."
