(dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (gentle romantic music) Hi. We're here. [Dodie] Hm? I said we're here. Already? Mm-hm. I had a wonderful time. Just wonderful. We're where? Well where we should be. A motel? That's right, a motel. Doug, what do you think I am? Well what were you on the beach an hour ago? Just because I kissed you? Is that what you called it? Oh, Doug. Don't "Oh, Doug" me. Now come on. I said come on. (ominous music) You've got the wrong girl. Uh-uh, you got the wrong guy. (suspenseful music) I'm going home, Doug. Okay. I'm just not that kind of a girl, Doug. Okay. Dodie. Yes? (suspenseful music) No hard feelings. (dramatic music) (Dodie screams) What'd he do it with? His hands, would ya believe it? Who was she? Dorothy Pierce, known as Dodie, Caucasian, age 20. Secretary in a downtown insurance office. They found her body in a motel driveway out on Olympic. Got anything? Nothing much. Nobody at the motel saw or heard anything. How come? They were all sleeping. Here ya are, Sergeant Falin. Where do you want it? Over there. Lemme know when you're through with it. Okay. All we know is the guy is young, good looking, drove a flashy convertible, and this was their first date. How'd you get all that? Her roommate. Appears the girl called her about five yesterday afternoon all excited. Said she'd met this, I quote, "Dreamy guy in a fancy convertible at the beach." He'd asked her out to dinner and a big time. That's the last anybody saw or heard of her until they scraped up what was left of her in the motel driveway. Sounds like some local playboy got handed his hat and forgot his manners. Five'll get ya 10 his lawyer calls in an hour or so, tries to make a deal for temporary insanity. (grunts) We'll hear from this guy again, but not through his lawyers. This guy's not through flexin' his muscles yet. Repeater? - That's right. - What've ya got to go on? Let me show ya. "Assailant continued to beat victim "after all resistance had ceased, "continued in fact until sometime after death." This guy enjoyed it. (upbeat jazzy music) [Announcer] And now for the local news. The brutal murder of secretary Dorothy Pierce remains unsolved. Police report no new clues to the identity of the fiend who beat this lovely girl to death last night. The 20 year-old girl was identified by her roommate, Miss Mary Lee Califano. (upbeat music) (suspenseful music) (bright music) (knuckles tapping) [Alma] Who is it? Doug Gerhardt. [Alma] Who? Doug Gerhardt. [Alma] Who? Yeakel Cadillac. Well why didn't ya say so? Go ahead and put the keys on the table, huh? (soft suspenseful music) Is it okay? Uh-huh. Good as new, it was just a short. (grunts) And that took all weekend, huh? Well the shop was closed. Had to track it down myself. Mm-hmm. I gotta sign anything? No, we sent the bill to Mr. Fencer's office. Oh, good lad. Your first initial A, Mrs. Durant? That's right, why? Well this must be yours then. I found it on the stairs. Put that on the table, too, will you? This is a pretty expensive compact. [Alma] Mm-hmm. You're not very appreciative. Oh, pardon me. (soft suspenseful music) Here. I wasn't looking for a tip, Ms. Durant. Well what were you looking for? I don't know, what do ya got? Listen, you, what I've got isn't for delivery boys, so you can can that poor but honest routine. Look, you're wrong now. I found this on the stairs. You found it in the glove compartment. That's where I keep it and that's where it was. Now do me a favor, Hiram, and put it down. You got me wrong. I ain't got you at all. Now go get in your kiddie car and get lost. (suspenseful music) (phone rings) Hello? Lou, darling. Oh, I've missed you. Tell me, I wanna hear all about it. Wait a minute, doll. Get lost. Get lost. Louise! You still there, Lou? Oh nothing, just a delivery boy. (gate rattles) Come on, hold on, Jeffy. (engine rumbling) (tires screeching) (Marian screams) Baby, baby, it's all right. It's all right, Jeffy. (Jeff crying) Oh darling, it's all over. Nothing happened, it's all over. (Jeff crying) Is he all right? I didn't even see ya. You all right, little boy? What's the matter with you driving like that? You could've killed us. Didn't you see us? I told you I didn't see you. I don't go around looking to run over people. I don't go around looking to break my own neck either. It's all right, darling. The man didn't mean to scare you. It was an accident. Oh, it's all over now. Well Mama's gonna pick up the groceries and then we'll go in the house and have an ice cream cone, a double one, all right? [Jeff] Fine. - Can I give ya a hand? - No thank you. (soft suspenseful music) I said I'm sorry. Thanks for your help. Sure, ya get it all? I think so. I'll take that now. Oh, let me carry it in for you. No thank you. Come on, Jeffy. (soft suspenseful music) (ominous music) [Lee] It's paint. Dug it out from under her fingernails. Okay, so we now know it's a red convertible. A red Cadillac convertible. We picked this lighter up at the scene. Well, at least the kid went out in style. Oh yeah, real style. She was in the cream of the crop, new Cad, one of the flashiest jobs they make. - Where'd ya get that? - Well you saw the body. You remember that bruise on her forehead, the one with the sharp outline? Yeah. Well, this is what did it. She musta hit her head on it when he beat her. Well what is it? It's a medallion. They put 'em on the back of the seats on Eldorados. Guy's loaded, huh? They don't come in Cracker Jack boxes. No, especially red ones. Motor Vehicle doesn't list by color. Guess our best bet is to check out the guys that sell 'em. Anything else, Lee? Nah, that's about it, unless the coroner can fill you in on what kind of a wild night she had before she got it. Some wild night. All she had in her was a couple of beers and some cheap chow mein. Real spender, huh? Sounds typical. Well, so long, Lee. Take it easy. - Hey, Bill. - Yeah? Why do ya figure they'd do it? Do what? I mean, a guy's gonna kill a girl. He doesn't have to beat her up like that. Why do ya figure they do it? Who knows? Unhappy childhood. Maybe his mother got soap in his eye. Hey, hey, come on, come on, take it easy. Off the bed, off the bed, will ya? Come on! Is that natural? Of course it is, dear. You oughta read Giselle O'Neil. Listen, I'm not the one that should read it, they should. (kids giggling) Well you know, as long as you're making like a parent, there is something that you could talk to them about. What? Well I found them on the roof this morning outside their bedroom. They'd unlocked the window and were running around with nothing but their T-shirts on. On the roof? [Marian] Mm. Come here, come here. Jeffy, Josh, come here. Listen. Oh my goodness, you're getting heavy. Now look, in the first place, if you're gonna go in for second story work, ya gotta have on pants. I mean, it's a union rule. And in the second place, the whole idea is kinda passe. I mean, the smart money is in fixin' TV sets and sellin' used cars. So stay off the roof, okay? [Jeff And Josh] Okay. All right. It's after eight o'clock. You better kiss Daddy goodnight. Good, gimme a hug, come on. Bring us something from San Francisco. Now you tell me one thing you don't have and I'll bring it. Mouseke-shoes. Mouseke-shoes? When I was a kid they went barefoot. Hey, what are they tryin' to do to that mouse, make Adolphe Menjou out of him? (boys giggle) Come on, off to bed. Let's go, go on. Come on. Look, I am goin' to Frisco on business for two days, maybe three. I'll be locked up all day with these guys and probably half the night. There won't be anything for ya to do. You don't know what it is, Woody, never being away from the house. Even just two days is seeing something different. (gentle music) You know, the last time I took ya to Frisco you weren't five minutes away from the house before you wanted to turn around and see how the kids were. Jeffy had a cold. Ya know, you're makin' me a heavy? What am I goin' up there for, myself or you and the kids? Why did I break my back to go from a gas pusher to owning my own business? Because I need Mouske-shoes? (phone rings) Hello? Oh, Mrs. McNeal. Just a minute and I'll find out. It's the sitter. Look, baby, I'm beat. I mean, I've gotta catch a plane in the morning. Tell her maybe next week, all right? Mrs. McNeal? No, thanks very much for calling, but we've decided to spend the evening at home. Well I know. Well, maybe one night next week. Bye. (horn honking) Come on, Daddy, it's school time! All right, all right, take it easy. You've got 16 more years of school left. You'll burn yourself out. Look, I get this deal, I'll bring ya back the Golden Gate Bridge, all right? All right. And you'll call me tomorrow and let me know how you're making out. Yeah, first thing in the morning. I'll be waiting with bated breath to find out if I'm a Jag owner. Neither one of us are gonna be owners until we sell a couple of 'em. Talk to ya in the mornin'. Hurry up, Daddy, we're gonna be late for school. All right, all right. Let's go. Lift your legs. Put your feet on top. Ready? (suspenseful music) (knob clicking) (water sloshing) (doorbell ringing) - (dramatic music) - Hi. Hello. I've been sitting out there about 15 minutes trying to get up enough nerve to ring that doorbell. You're not still sore, are you? Well you scared my little boy half to death. You oughta be more careful. Well, it was just one of those things. I was late getting back and my boss has been all over me for a week. All right. Honest, I'm real sorry. Well, I guess it was partly my fault, too. I should've kept him closer to me. It was nice of you to come by. Oh, and another thing. Yesterday after you left, why, I found this. I know what it is for a man to be on the town without his yo-yo. That was very sweet of you. You know he's been looking for it high and low. (water gurgling) Oh, the washer, it's still filling. What's the matter? Oh, it's overflowing again. Here, let me do that. I know about such things. You got a wrench? Oh, in the garage. You want me to get it? No, no. Clean up, here. Probably just clogged. Maybe I can reach it. You're getting soaked. That's all right, it's part of our service. I can lend you one of my husband's shirts. That'll be fine. Fine. Too much in there. Did you do this? It musta shrunk about four sizes. I'm afraid I did. It musta been in with the clothes. Oh, poor Jeffy. You think he'll ever forgive me? Lady, you're gonna have an awful lot of explaining to do. (Marian laughs) A red Eldorado, huh? Just a minute, let me check. Well here's a red one. I sold it to Ralph E. Brooks at 423 Kolona Avenue, Hawaii. Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that one. The car's been in Honolulu for six months. (grunts) Got any others? Oh, there's Louis T. Fencer of 8470 Melrose out in Hollywood. You know it's the Lou Fencer who prints all those magazines. Calls himself The Fighting Publisher. And that's it, huh? Well that's it for the red ones. People think it makes 'em look like a clown. Now, if you wanted black ones, I've got about 15 of those. Just a minute. Doug. Hey, Doug. [Employee] Ain't seen him since morning, Mr. Yeakel. Boy, help is murder. That's it for the red ones. Lou Fencer's the only one. He in any kind of trouble? I wouldn't know, Mr. Yeakel. All depends on where his car was Sunday night. Not a bad sheet, even if I say so myself. I guess ya could say we're all kinda in the same business, couldn't ya? Collectin' the facts and then stickin' 'em to someone. Course some people resent it, but it's worth it. Sells a lotta magazines. And what about your car, Mr. Fencer? My car? Which car? I got a whole garage full of 'em, including one of them that's guaranteed to stop anything up to a bazooka shell. It's the only way I can insured. Your red Eldorado. Now you're talkin' about a car. That's my pet, my baby. What's the problem? Some trouble Sunday involving one. Not too many in the area, we're checking 'em all out. Sunday, huh? You know who was drivin' it? A young man, a good looking young man. (laughs) And you come and talk to me? Are you kiddin'? Just the routine check, Mr. Fencer. Where was your car on Sunday? Under lock and key. This key. I was away all weekend, Palm Springs on a story. You can check if you want to, the Hotel Del Mar. Would any young man have access to your car? I'm the only man that's got access to it, young or old. All right, Mr. Fencer. I guess that's it for now. We may wanna talk to you again later on. Sure, great. Glad to be of help, anytime. Hey, tell me somethin'. In my magazines there's always a dame, ya know, big, blonde and all that. Is there a dame mixed up in this? Well why don't you check your magazine. Cops with a sense of humor, that's a switch. Well, if ya change your mind, maybe if you wanna grill me some more, you can find me here anytime. We'll keep you in mind. Anytime. You tramp, you lousy tramp. I leave ya alone for two lousy days and you're out runnin' around. Lou, Lou, what are ya talkin' about? Save your breath, tramp. I didn't buy ya that car so you could fouled up with some beach bum. Ya think I want the hyenas in this town smearin' my name all over the front pages? But it was at Yeakel's all weekend! What? That's a lousy excuse. You're gonna have to do better than that, Alma, because I'm gonna check on it. And if it don't check out, I'm gonna be tellin' 14 million readers what you did for a livin' for three years before ya met me, and I won't use the rubber stamp over your face! - Eunice. - Yes, sir. Call that Cadillac place and find out if the red convertible was in there for repairs. [Eunice] It was, Mr. Fencer. Huh, how do you know? [Eunice] Bill came in this morning. It was there on the 11th and 12th. It was, huh? [Eunice] I have it right on my desk. Would you like me to bring it in? No, no, forget it. Get me Miss Durant. [Eunice] Yes, sir. Wait a minute, forget that, too. I think I'll just let her sweat for awhile. (soft suspenseful music) Ya got another one, don't ya, bigshot? Saw it parked downstairs. Yeah, how do ya like it? Think you'll fool anybody? Myself. Makes me forget this place for a couple of hours. Look, Ma, what am I supposed to do with this, swallow it? Just because you don't smoke, can't ya have a couple of ashtrays around the place? Eh, I don't like butts all over the place. They make a mess. Ya know, sooner or later Yeakel's gonna find out about it and you're gonna be right back in trouble. You're not gonna find about it and I'm not gonna get in any trouble. You understand that, Ma? Suit yourself. Want some supper? No thanks. I'm eating out. Big cars. Restaurants. (laughs) Makes me laugh the way ya think you're gonna fool somebody. What's the matter, Ma? Can't you stand me havin' a good time? You had your good times, you remember that, don't you? You're gettin' awful excited, Doug. You feel all right? Now don't you start that again. Now you took five years outta my life with your ink blots and your clinics, so don't you get that anxious look back in your face 'cause I know what it means. For your own good. Sure. That's what every kid wants, Ma, to be locked in a hospital makin' raffia baskets. Look, maybe if ya don't feel all right, Doug. Maybe I should call the doctor. You don't scare me. You won't call anybody, you know why? Because if ya do ya lose your meal ticket. And then you'll have to stop stuffin' yourself and go out and get a job. (soft ominous music) Doug. Yeah? 15. I'm gonna tell you something. One of these days I'm gonna find me an angle that's gonna spring me outta here. And when I do, I'm gonna dump you just like the old man did. Ya just don't sound too well to me, Doug. Then why don't you call somebody? Well I'm still your mother. What ya got in the box? A hat. How do ya like it? (upbeat orchestral music) Here, sir. Two beers. Thank you. You know, nothing's changed. Nothing's changed at all. Don't you believe it. I bet I couldn't go nine innings today if my life depended on it. (chuckles) Maybe that's why I don't remember you. I always had a crush on whoever was the football hero that year. I don't think I ever went near a baseball game in school. Nobody did. I pitched two no-hit games that season. I bet there wasn't 12 people in the stands. Well, didn't you go to any of the dances? Who did you hang out with? Oh, nobody. See, we'd just gotten here from Louisville. I didn't know a soul. I was all hipped on being a big athlete, you know, early bed to bed and all that. Do you remember Old Kruger? Do I? What a character he was. He? Mrs. Kruger, she taught English Lit. Oh yeah. Well the years sure are piling up. Here, you want some more? I don't think so. Oh go ahead, it's only domestic. Just a little. Ya know, it's funny. Here we are, two people with the same background and the same memories, and we would've passed each other by like strangers if you hadn't noticed my yearbook at the house. Yeah, when I saw that I knew we had a lot in common. I still feel a little guilty, though. Oh come on, Marian, don't start that again. No, we really should've waited 'til Friday night. Woody would've enjoyed seeing this place again and going over old times, too. I bet he would've remembered you. No, not unless he was one of those 12 in the stands. No, I bet he would. When we were in school he knew everybody. He liked to go every place and do everything. We had the best time. You make it sound like the honeymoon's over. Oh no. It's just that, well, things are different now. Woody's building a business and I'm raising the kids. We have a good life. There are nights, though, that I guess I wish he'd look at me instead of the television set. I'd look at you. (gentle music) You don't know what kind words those are to the mother of two. No, I mean it, Marian. You're a very pretty girl. And you're a nice man to bolster the morale of an old married woman like me. I got a nickel. You wanna go inside and dance? No. I'd just like to sit here and listen to the music and enjoy being a femme fatale. Well lady, if that's what you want, that's what you're gonna get. Doug, what are you doing? Don't do that. Why not? You're the pretty girl and I'm the nice man, remember? Doug, please. I suppose I deserve this. I'm married and I really had no right to be out with you. I was lonesome and, well, I thought you understood. But I never meant it this way, Doug, never for a minute. Oh come on now, Marian. You don't have to put on an act with me. [Marian] Doug, please. Don't do that again. (horn honking) Is there a flashlight in there? No, it's empty. (horn honking) [Man] What's goin' on down there? All right, all right, I'll take ya home. What's the matter? You borrowed this car, didn't you? No, I bought it outta my tips. Did you think you had to take it? Did you think I'd like you better if you had? What'd you wanna do, Marian, hang on the back of my motorcycle? [Marian] It's not that bad, is it? You can fix it tomorrow. It's a brand new car. My boss, he's a hawk. If he spots it, he'll have the cops on my neck in a minute. For borrowing a car? (soft somber music) Yeah, for borrowing a car. What do you need to fix it? I don't know. I don't even know where the short is. I need a place to work, I need some tools. I think maybe I can help you. What? I said, I think I can help you. Come on, Doug, let's get in the car. (ominous music) Get me the desk sergeant. Hello? This is Albert Graves, CP Motel. About that bulletin you sent out, I don't know if it means anything, but I just had a white Eldorado drive in here with a man and woman in it, had some trouble with their horn. [Officer] In the three column, 37R621, 39J768. In the two column, 23W378. [Dispatcher] Standby. Attention all units. Be on the lookout for a white Cadillac Eldorado, last seen westbound on Olympic near Regent. Repeat, this is a white Cadillac Eldorado. Driver of this vehicle is wanted for questioning in a murder case. [Officer] In the two column. - Ya hear that? - 23W378. For two days we're lookin' for a red one, now suddenly it's a white one. I wish they'd make up their mind. It's this key. The lock's right over there, Doug. Where are you? [Marian] Wait a minute, Doug, I'll turn on the lights. Hey, what's this? Oh, Woody's a specialist. He's got a real feeling for sports cars. People bring them in from all over for him to fix. His mechanics, that is. Woody's gotten to be kind of an executive. The only car he'll condescend to work on is his own. Uh-huh. [Marian] He takes it apart and puts it back together again whenever he gets mad. Says it helps him get it out of his system. You mean he owns all this? That's right. You know, it's a good angle. (soft suspenseful music) Expensive cars. Expensive repair bills. Place like this could keep you rolling in dough forever, huh, Marian? I guess it could, but Woody puts almost every cent he makes right back into it. He believes in progress. Ya know, watch us grow and all that. Yeah. I know what he means. The bigger you get the less people can step on you. Oh nobody steps on Woody. He started as a mechanic and built this whole thing by being what he calls a real go-getter. Right now he's up in San Francisco working on a Jag agency. If he gets it, he's gonna put a big showroom up out there. You know, 3,000 feet of glass and chrome. You really got it made, haven't you, Marian? We've got our foot in the door. Yeah, it's a real pretty foot, too. Well. We came here to get you out of trouble, remember? I think you'll find everything you need. I'll be in the office. There may be some mail Woody should know about. Thank you, Marian. (soft suspenseful music) Oh, you startled me. All fixed? It's all fixed. (soft suspenseful music) You know, with those glasses on, you look like you know what you're doing. I do. I was Woody's bookkeeper for a year in the beginning. Tell me, Marian, how much it take to get a place like this started? Oh, $1,000, a lot of credits, a little nerve, and a lot of hard work. Well what's it worth now? That's a question Woody only has to answer for the income tax people. And me since it's a community property stake. Community property, that means it's his and yours, is that right? That's right. I think it's a very fair law. I own half his garage and he owns half my Mixmaster. And you know all about this business, huh, Marian? Oh boy, if you mean could I take off a head gasket, no. But I suppose I could run this end of it as well as Woody. Maybe even better. I'll call ya tomorrow. What? [Doug] I said I'll call ya tomorrow, in the morning. I don't think that's such a good idea, Doug. Why don't we just leave it that we happened to go to the same school, hm? I'll call ya tomorrow. What do you see in me anyway? A chance, chance of a lifetime. I'll call ya tomorrow. [Marian] Come on, Jeffy. (phone ringing) The phone is ringing, Mama. I know it is, dear, but let's go, hm? (phone ringing) Operator, are you sure you're trying the right number? Well this is her husband. She said she'd be waiting for my call this morning. (soft ominous music) I'm alone here, I have two children. You mean you're really not in with him? It's all in his head? Of course it is. Well you don't have to call anybody. He's not as bad as I made out, I was just tryin' to scare you. My husband's away, he won't be back until tomorrow. Look, Mrs. Wood, one night won't make any difference, will it? First thing tomorrow morning I'll call his doctor. No, I really can't. Mrs. Wood, you told me you got two kids. You oughta know how a mother feels. He's all I got. It ain't been easy for me either. All right. Thanks. You won't be sorry. We won't be botherin' ya anymore. I guess I better go. Sure got a nice place. Mrs. Gerhardt, I'm worried. He's been here once today, what if he comes back? He won't, he won't. But if he should, tell him anything. Tell him what bigshot he is. He likes to hear that. Only don't tell him I was here. Ya know how boys are about their mothers buttin' in. He'd get awful mad. All right. Goodnight. (ominous music) (branches cracking) Doug? Doug? Doug is that you? (rocks tapping) (soft suspenseful music) (Doug hooting) (gentle orchestral music) (ominous music) (soft suspenseful music) (rocks tapping) (soft suspenseful music) (rock tapping) (dramatic music) I called you. (rock tapping) Musta been about 10 times. [Marian] I wasn't home, Doug. I know that, came by. You get the candy? [Marian] Yes, yes I did, thank you. Why weren't you home, Marian? I waited all day like a schoolboy. That's no way to treat a man. I went to the beach. I wanted to get the kids out. Get 'em out? Why get 'em out? I like kids. You give 'em a chance, they'll like me. I bought 'em a hat, didn't I? Yes, yes, you did, thank you. "Thank you, thank you," that's not what I want, Marian. What do you want? You. (laughs) (Marian gasps) Honey, I scared you, I scared you bad. Marian, I was just burnt up because you stood me up, 'cause I waited for you all day. Oh, stop shakin', baby. There's nothin' to be scared of now. Look, Marian, I wouldn't wanna scare you. I'd rather cut off my arm first. I just want you to like me like I like you. Oh, I do. I do, Doug, very much. Do you really, Marian? Do you really? Yes, I do, I really do, I... Then don't say another word. Not another word. That's all I wanted to hear you say. It's all I needed to hear you say. We had a good time last night, didn't we? It was fun, wasn't it? Yes, it was fun. (suspenseful music) [Doug] And everything really is okay between us, isn't it? [Marian] Everything's fine. [Doug] Well then smile, baby. It wasn't so bad, was it? No, it wasn't bad. It's after midnight now, Doug. You really have to go home. [Doug] I'm crazy about you. You know that, don't you? [Marian] I'm glad. [Doug] You won't be sorry, Marian. I promise you, you won't be sorry. [Marian] All right, Doug. We can talk about it tomorrow. Now, please go. [Doug] In a little while, baby, in a little while. So, what do ya got? Oh, the cigarette lighter came from Fencer's Eldorado, all right. Scratch marks match all around, and I can put the Pierce girl in that car so tight no lawyer in the country'll get her out. How? Fingerprints for one thing. There were two or three on the door. And blood spatter's type O, same as hers. He tried to wash 'em off with soap and water but they came up like geraniums with a Benzedrine test. It's Gerhardt. What'd you find? Alma Durant, a friend of a friend, she confirmed the fact that Gerhardt had the car out all weekend. If that's not enough, I've got this. What is it? His record. Three years at Camarillo, two at county. He's on parole right now. You got an address? 218 South 6th, apartment 2B. You got your muscle? Yeah, let's go. (phone ringing) Hello? Yeah, Marian. Yeah, I got in this morning. Yeah, yeah, I had a lot of things to do. Uh-huh, well I've got a lot to talk to you about, too. It'll have to wait 'til later. No, I don't want you comin' down here, I'm working. Now I'll talk to ya when I get home. Well I don't know what time. When I get there. What? Yeah, sure, I got the Jag gig. Yeah, thanks a lot. Look, Marian, I'm busy. I'll see you. [Doug] Trouble? No, no trouble. Hey listen, I'm not plannin' to put anybody on for at least a couple months, so why don't you leave your name and maybe later on we can get together. [Doug] Uh-huh. Oh, do me a favor, will ya? Hand me that 15/16th over there on the table. (soft ominous music) Sure. Here you are. Thanks, hang onto this a second, will you? Where are you workin' now? Yeakel Cadillac. Oh yeah? That's right. Pretty big outfit. What kind of service department they got? I said what kind of service department they got? Oh, nothing special. We just try to please the customers. [Woody] You been workin' there long? About four or five months. [Woody] Long enough to get to know everybody I guess, huh? Most everybody. How many guys you say you got workin' there? I didn't say. But we got eight. There's four washers, two mechanics, and two delivery boys. [Woody] Pretty tight operation. No time for goofin' off in a setup like that, huh? It's an eight-hour day, just like any other job. A man's got all night if he's got any other ideas. Yeah. Yeah, I know what you mean. Listen, you got a mechanic down there, a young guy named Doug Ferguson? A fella 'bout 28? Uh-uh, no, Yeakel, he believes in experienced men. I don't think there's a man under 40 in his shop. [Woody] Well, maybe I was wrong about the age. None of 'em named Doug either. Seems to me I know a guy down there named Doug. Maybe it was one of the... The washers? [Woody] Yeah, a washer. He's not your problem, Woody. Well what's your name, mister? Gerhardt, Doug Gerhardt. Listen, mister, we got somethin' to talk about. (Woody cries out) Yeah? What? I'll call the morgue. - How long ya figure it's been? - Eh, let the coroner tell us. I never guess these things right. A real nice boy, huh? Yeah. His clothes are still here. A couple of suitcases. Doesn't look like he's taken off yet. Apparently he doesn't even know she's dead. No. Well, there's no blood in the bed. None around here. Musta beat her up someplace else. She had enough left to make it home, but not enough to stay alive. Boy, he really worked at it. You gonna call the morgue. Yeah. Be good. Just tell 'em to put a stakeout on that place where he works and get out an all-points. What about her? Nothin' gonna help her anymore. If Gerhardt should come back, we don't want an ambulance and 10 cops parked downstairs. Now, let's you and me just sit it out and wait to meet him personally. (somber music) How bad? Pretty bad. But you're going to be all right, darling. It'll take time, but you're going to be fine. The truth? The truth. Does it hurt? Only when I laugh. I love you, Woody. Do you? More than anything in the world. I came home last night. I heard you on the sundeck. What? I know about him, Marian. He was there when the motor dropped. It wasn't an accident. Who was there? [Woody] Doug. The man you called Doug on the sundeck. (soft ominous music) Oh my God. Oh my God. Woody, no matter what you think, no matter what you heard, trust me more. I'm your wife and that's all I ever wanna be. The truth? The truth. Go to sleep, darling. (gentle music) (soft suspenseful music) This is Mrs. Charles Wood. My husband's in room 219. I wanna be connected with the police. Thank you. What's that? Well did they say who it was? Well, yes, if it's urgent, I'll take it. Hello? (dramatic music) Doug. That's right. I heard about it. How is he, Marian, is he gonna be all right? Yes, yes, he's very badly hurt, but he's going to be fine. It's nice of you to call. Well, how did it happen? Do you know how it happened? No, no, I don't. Listen, Doug, I'm tying up one of the hospital phones. One of the nurses wants to use it. Give me your number and I'll call you back. Yeah, well is he awake yet, Marian? Have ya talked to him yet? No, no, I haven't. Look, Doug, I can call you right back. Where are you? Where am I? I'm waiting for you, Marian. Waiting for me? What for? Doug, where are you? I'm at your house, babysitting. And I'm gonna need you, so you better get down here in one big hurry. At my house? Where's Mrs. McNeal? Oh, I gave her five bucks and she pulled out. I'm a friend of the family. Where are the... The kids? Oh, you don't have to worry about them. I'm watching 'em real close. I'll leave right now, Doug. I'll be there as soon as I can. You do that. And Marian, you keep your mouth shut because if I smell a cop within 10 blocks of this place those kids won't get another day older, you understand? I understand. Doug, why are you doing this? (ominous music) Come on home, Marian. Just come on home and find out. (dramatic music) Operator. Give me the police. Is he armed? I don't know. Is there a gun in the house? Yes, there is, my husband's Army .45. It's in the downstairs closet. Overall laid out, except for the roof across the alley. I figured I'd take that. I'll take the front. How many you got? I got eight. Two units on the way. Well, what's it gonna be? I'll give her 15 minutes. 15 minutes? That's right. Well that's not enough. Look, Mrs. Wood, this man's a murderer. He's already killed two women and tried to kill your husband. From out here we don't know what's going on. He could kill you and your kids while we sat around for hours lookin' like a bunch of Humpty Dumptys. I don't care what you look like. I'm not gonna let him hurt my children, and I'm not gonna let you go breaking in there until I've had a chance to get them out. But you don't even know what he wants. I don't care what he wants. Whatever it is I'm gonna get my kids out. 15 minutes. That's not fair. It's 10:15. You've got until 10:30. You're not the only one with kids, Mrs. Wood. If we take a chance on this getting away, it could be somebody else's kids next time. All right. If they come out and you're not with 'em, we have to go in. You understand we can't wait for you. I understand. Can I go now? Sure. (suspenseful music) (ominous music) Hello, Marian. A real great desperado, huh? Next time you see Woody, you thank him for me, huh? Where are the boys? Oh, they're in there. I got lonesome. I wanna see them. Josh, Jeff, wake up. Mama's home. You really burned me on the phone, Marian. "Where are you, Doug? "I'll call you right back, Doug." You nearly cashed them in right then and there. What room is that? [Detective] That's her bedroom. You said you needed me. What do you want? What do I want? Oh, I want a lotta things, Marian. I woulda had 'em, too, if Woody had died like a gentleman. I'da had the business and I'da had you. You're thinkin' you wouldn't have had me, but you would've. You would've. That's all dead now. I've got problems in this town, big problems. I gotta get out while the gettin's good. My car is downstairs, I'll give you the keys. Oh, you're gonna give me a lot more than that, Marian. I need money. Woody's wallet's right here. I brought it from the hospital. 41 bucks. That's not gonna take me very far, Marian. What? I think there's more. These are traveler's checks. If you take Woody's drivers license you can cash them. You're a liar, just like you were last night. Now I can feel 'em out there. You brought those cops back with ya. The minute I stick my head out the door they're gonna blow it off. No, that's not true. You're a liar. You're wrong, Doug, you're wrong. (ominous music) Okay. (suspenseful music) All right, let's get set. You wanna take a chance? No, I gave her 15 minutes and that's what she gets. Then we go in. (suspenseful music) Looks like Woody didn't always sit home and watch TV, huh, Marian? If you have everything you need, I wish you'd go, Doug. Oh, I have almost everything. What else do you want? You're kidding, aren't you, Marian? What do you mean? I mean maybe I'm not gonna get a fancy sports car business but I am gonna get something for my trouble. Or they're not gonna wake up. You understand that? All right, Doug. I understand. Things are sure looking up for Douglas T. I got the time, I got the place, and I got the girl. No, Doug, not with the boys here. Okay, get 'em out. (soft suspenseful music) Lights just went on. Kids' room. Josh, listen to me. Try to stay awake and listen to me. I want you to do something very special and grownup. Do you hear me, Josh? And now it's very important. I'm going to go in my room and close my door, and when I do, you've got to take Jeffy down the stairs and all the way outside. Why, Mama? Don't ask me any question now. Just this once, just do as I say. Take your brother all the way outside. (footsteps thudding) Now, coach? Now. Goodnight, Josh. I'll see you in the morning. Goodnight, men, sleep tight. Wake up, Jeff. (Jeff groaning) Wake up. (Jeff groaning) (lock clicks) Would you close the door? Sure thing, Marian. (orchestral music blaring) That's a little better isn't it? I'd like a drink. Fine. I brought you a glass. Pour me one, too, will ya, Marian? Come on, Jeffy. We have to go downstairs. (door rattling) Did you hear something? It's just Jeffy climbing into the top bunk. What happens now, Marian? What happens now is I finish my drink. Down the hatch. I only got one night, Marian. I'll be right back. Uh-uh. What? I don't trust you like I used to, Marian. So you just stay where I can see you. I'll turn out the light. I said I wanna see you. (gentle orchestral music) (knee thudding) I heard someone. And don't you tell me I didn't. It's just the boys. Don't go, Doug. You don't wanna go now. Not now. So this is married life. Tell me, Marian, don't you get tired of the same guy, same guy, same guy? I can't, I can't. (crying) You make me sick. (ominous music) (Marian gasps) You tell me what's so big and so great and wonderful about women I make 'em sick. You frighten them. You like to frighten them because you hate them. You hate them all! And they're full of hate! (Marian cries out) (dramatic music) (soft suspenseful music) It's the kids. [Josh] Come on, Jeffy, hurry it up. (suspenseful music) [Doug] Josh. I haven't got a shot. The kids are too close. Your mama's hurt. She wants you. What's the matter? She needs you. She wants you inside. I said get in here. (guns firing) (Doug cries out) (Marian sobs) (somber music) You all right, Mrs. Woods? The boys, where are the boys? Go get them. And don't bring 'em back through here. They've seen enough of him. Okay. Guess you have, too, Mrs. Woods. Let's go outside. Murphy'll bring the boys to you. (somber music) Mommy! - Mommy, Mommy! - Mama! - Mommy! - Mommy! It's all right, dear, it's all right. (dramatic orchestral music)
