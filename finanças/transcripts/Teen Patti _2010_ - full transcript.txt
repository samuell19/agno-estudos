Dear Mr. Venkat Subramaniam, I request your presence, for a face to face meeting to discuss relevant opportunities. Anxiously awaiting your arrival. Yours sincerely, Perci Trachtenberg, Chairman, Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Cambridge. Hello, Mr. Subramaniam. Welcome to Aspinalls. Mr. Trachtenberg is waiting for you, upstairs. Please follow me. You must be Venkat Sss... Subramaniam, it's South Indian. Would you believe me if I said I pronounced your name in front of the mirror several times? To be honest, Perci Trachtenberg, took me a few attempts as well. There, you just said it. Any trouble finding the place? No, but these places always seem to find trouble for me. So what Ive heard is true. -Shall we get to it then? -Okay. I must say, I was taken quite by surprise when I received your letter. Ive been following your work for years. Several years. It's great honour to finally meet you. I see Ive got you fooled, along with everyone else. Theres a fine line... ...between madness and brilliance. You just have to choose which days you show what. I hear you play a mean game. Well, I hate to have come all this way to disappoint you, Mr. Trachtenberg, but I no longer play. Well, now my curiosity is piqued. What happened? Logic took the magic out of it. Isnt that a question I should be asking you, Mr. Trachtenberg? It's Perci to you. Alright then, Perci. -May I ask you a question, Perci? -You may. I know that you were a magician in your early years. Right? So tell me. How does a magician transform himself into a mathematician? You know what I find even more interesting. What's that? How a mathematician reinvents himself as a gambler. That, Mr. Trachtenberg, was purely a matter of chance. Purely a matter of chance. It is time for a new beginning in the old institution. From today, I am increasing the security on the campus and students rooms will be regularly inspected. Put electric fences around the campus, sir, and a hidden camera at every thirty meters. Don't take offence, sir. Because the disciplinary measures on the students of this age have always misfired. It's best to leave them alone. Everyone is not like you, Venkat. You are one in a million. Special, you know. I want weekly reports from every HOD. Thank you. Venkat, Id like a word with you, please. I want to talk to you about your research grant. Tell me, sir. Your ideas should also have some applications. But your ideas just don't go beyond being ideas... ...or obscure theories. Have studied my thesis, sir? Venkat, face the truth. All of your papers have been rejected. In three years, you will retire. You are a mediocre mathematician. You should be grateful that you have a job. Yeah. Today is the last day. And the last night too. What a fragrance, mate! It seems the technical institute has changed into an agricultural college. During the college festival, what do these professors do? What? We have investigated through a sting operation that everyone has gone to the deans rave party. What do you mean, everyone? I am here. Speak for the others. Please welcome, Professor Shantanu Vishwas. Vikram, one more fruit juice. Okay, silence please. The heart is naive, but the heart knows... It's always darkest before the dawn If winter comes, can spring be far behind? If you just wait a little longer without a frown... Time reveals the path to your dreams May you find your path Albeit by chance Time reveals the path to your dreams May you find your path Albeit by chance With starry eyes, they dream and their wait is endless With starry eyes, they dream and their wait is endless There are some doubts, but there is conviction too The wait is endless With starry eyes, they dream and their wait is endless Belladonna, will you tolerate me, for the rest of your life, please? Will you marry me, please? Please. Stay away from everyone, but you will not understand. Why would you understand? Listen, you are drunk. Very good, Viku. Very good! First booze, then cigarette, then drugs... Thats what you are here for. Do you know the consequences? What if your father finds out? Perci Trachtenberg is right. What is there is not there... ...and what is not there may be there Sorry, sorry, sorry. Actually, I was waiting, for the congratulations. Since I have become the head of the department, you are the only one who hasnt congratulated me. Sorry, sir. I forgot a bit. -By the way... -Yes, sir. The suggestions that you had submitted to the dean about the improvement of the department, I have read that. Don't feel bad. I have some other plans about the improvement. Regarding the question of relations between the professor and the students... Good morning. Good morning, sir. Please be seated. Come on, Vikram. So today we will study the theory of probability. We will play a game to understand it. The Monty Hall game, you know. So three cups A, B and C. Three cups, yeah. You can assume them as three doors. Now I will keep... ...a car under one cup. Three cups, three doors, behind one there is a car. We will shuffle the three. If you are asked to choose a door then which one would you choose? Yes, Aparna. Sir, I choose the door C. Aparna chooses the door C. The first choice. We will not open this. Monty Hall says, randomly open one door, so let's open A. No car here. According to probability, if you can change the first choice, do you wish to change it or not? -Sid? -Yes, sir. -Daya! -Is it easiest? -No, sir. -Aparna says no. Okay, let's see if Aparna is right or wrong. First choice, no car. The car is here. We should always change our first choice. Because it is always seen, that the first choice is mostly wrong. Confused? Okay, follow me. Come on. Come along. Gather around, everybody. Keep some distance. Are you watching, sir? Hes teaching maths in the tennis court. Mr. Mathur, do you know why there is a department of maths in... -An educational institute like ours? -No. To relieve the mental asylum some of their burden. I didnt understand. Venkat belongs in a mental asylum, but we are keeping him here. And we are... What do you mean? We are going to use a crazy ball. Called crazy because we can't predict it's bounce. So when I say Vikram, what is the probability that it will actually go to Vikram? Alright, ready? Here we go. Vikram... Where did it go? No, it's here with Venkat. You see, the theory of probability. -Do you have cards? -Yes. Playing cards, a deck of cards. Yeah. Some coffee, sir? Yes, strong. Strong. -Hello. -Why don't you pick up the phone? Yes, Pravin, how are you? I was just going to call you. -Yes, I know. -No, I am not joking. You were going to repay the loan of 300 thousand three months ago. 300 thousand! My men will visit you. Give them the money fast. Look, Pravin, three months... -Yes. -I want the money ready. Listen to me. Hello... You cannot have the ace card. -Hey, I told you... -Shantanu, what's the matter? -Sorry, babe. -With whom were you talking? Shivani, I thought it was someone else. -You promised me a ring. -You will get the ring. -But when? -Soon. That's all you're worried about. -Soon I'll be off to New York. -What are you saying? Sir, coffee. I got hundred percent scholarship. Can you believe it? No way! I mean, wow! Great! -I'm so happy. -Yes, listen. To get hundred percent scholarship is not an easy thing. -We need to celebrate. -Really? It's going to be my treat. We'll go to dinner in the evening at Oris. Will have to analyse the influence from the base. Okay, listen, there is someone at the door. So we will meet in the evening at nine. It's a date. -Please be on time. -Bye. One minute, I am coming. Just a minute. -I am Pandya. Do you know Pravin? -I know. He has sent me. Why are you messing with him? Come on, take out the money. You, get in and grab the laptop and other things fast. Yes, you are going down. This can't be your hand. Wait, I had a word with Pravin. Look, I can call him right now. Look, I also have a phone. Shall I call him? Shuffling is never perfect and never random. Trevor, try to understand. It's an emergency, man. Just think of it as a favour, for the benefit of maths. Optimum and exploitive strategies. Yeah, okay. Thanks. I have arranged it. I will repay you tomorrow. -Tomorrow? Yes? -Okay, you may leave. This is brilliant. Sir, what is this? What are you up to now? Shantanu, I will tell you. You get three students and come to me in ten minutes. This could be a breakthrough. Hi, good evening. -Aparna and Sid. -Yes, sir. -Good evening, sir. -Sorry to bother you. Good evening. -No, tell him not to send money. -Please come to classroom nine. There's nothing... Didn't I tell you? Sir. I will call you tomorrow. Show me the cards. Jack of hearts, ace of spades, two of clubs... Now show me your hand. Let's see your hand. Ace of diamonds, queen of diamonds, queen of spades... Yes. Pair of queens you have. You will not win this game. This game will be won by that hand. It has two kings, and maybe three. -Probability. -Card counting. But in this game, you can't memorise all the cards. Yeah, yeah. Sir, doesn't shuffling ruin the predictions? Bravo, Vikram! Brilliant! Shuffling can create a problem. But you know, shuffling is never perfectly random. If I see two games or two hands, I can predict the cards movement to some extent. This is your game. Wow, sir, this is magic. No magic. It's mathematics. This is it. Look at the possibilities. I mean, my mind is racing. If I play some more games then I can crack it. This is my research. Yes, sir. Why don't we try this in a real, random situation? Then we will come to know, if your theory is working or not. But this game was on the internet. Random situation or games cassette... Sir, many such dens are there where such games are played. Very professionally. Slightly underground, that's all. Sir, give me two days. I will make arrangements. Then we can really check out your theory. This is not right. Classes at this time? No, special assignment, sir. -Good evening, sir. -Good evening, sir. Good evening, sir. Good evening, sir. Just locking up. Hey, what's up? How come you are here? Are you here to meet me? What? Good night, sir. What happened? Hello. Don't pretend, Shantanu. Hey, what happened? Seriously, I am lost here. Help me. I don't know what's happening. Oris. What happened to Oris? I waited there for four hours. What's the time? What's the date? We were supposed to go there tomorrow. Not today. I texted you today, check your phone. There is a limit to everything, Shantanu. I've had enough. Look, I have just proposed now. You cannot be so upset, got it? Good morning. How are you? Good thing, I got some snacks to eat. This place hasn't been tidied up for weeks it seems. I will send Laxmi in the afternoon. You've started gambling, professor. No, the house is clean. No need to send Laxmi. There is so much dust here. I don't know how men can live like this. Professor Kale was also like you. Once I remember I had been to Kanpur, to submit my dissertation, and when I returned, I saw dust all over the house. I said, professor, what is all this? He said, what? He couldn't see the dust. I admit that you guys are so busy that you don't pay attention to such minor things. By the way, you were working on your research paper. Have you submitted it? Rejected? Again? I knew, it's not the first time. Professor Kale too went through it. These people, don't understand geniuses like you. Do you know what Professor Kale told me about you? He said that Professor Venkat would have surely won the Nobel Prize if he was in America. Oh no. You made me forgot my schedule with your talks. Yes, Mrs. Kale, the paper which I had submitted got rejected. Because what I can see, the dean cannot see. What do you say, Albert? What I had thought, it was brilliant. Just brilliant. No, no, once again. Just give me a moment. It's a discovery that will change the way we look at things. A definition of who we are... Man is a process not an event. We have to change our names and identities. There are two reasons. One, if we go there like this, we will stand out like sore thumbs. And the second reason is, by any means they should not figure out our real identities. Therefore, we will pretend to be folks who regularly visit there. We'll go separately. All of you will sit on different tables, after that Venkat will come to your table, and you will let him know which cards you are holding. Sir, how will we do that? Okay, good question. Just hold that thought, okay. You will tell Venkat which cards you are holding and after that hopefully, Venkat will be able to tell you who will win the game on that table. Right? Are you certain, that we have to change our identities? Yes, sir. I've figured it all out. For instance, I will be Bhadru and gambling will be my weakness. -Teen Patti. -Sid, you will enter next. After that I will signal you and tell you on which table you have to sit and play. -Hi, Dhaniram. -Siddharth, look at this. -I am taking your uniform. -Hey, where are you taking it? I want it. I will return it. What new drama are you holding? Yes, I am acting in a drama. That's why I need it. Oh, you are acting in a drama. Sir, we have a washer man in our campus. Daalchand, Rami has his exact shirt. So I will wear that. Are you out on a stroll? No, I am here to play cards. I can finish your cards right here. Sure, you got it. Aparna, this is a tough one. The kind of women that come there, I doubt... Sorry, sir, we cannot take her there. It's not her cup of tea. She can't do it. Yeah, I agree with Sid. What do you mean, I won't be able to do it? Sir, this is it not fair. This is an experiment. If Sid and Vikram can do it, then I can also do it. This is risky. We cannot take the chance. -Listen. -Hey, Aparna. -Guys, come on. -Excuse me, sir. Aparna, don't be silly. What's the matter? Do you know what type of girls come to that place? Sid, you always underestimate me. What happened? You know that that is no place for girls like you. Girls have to make their place. Sid, just forget it. Listen, every night we are going to practice signalling. Because the most important thing is that hoWe'ver we prepare ourselves, some things are out of our control. So we have to be alert and we have to be sharp, and we have to be very careful. Sir... What kind of a place is this? This is a social club, sir. All the biggies of Teen Patti will be present here. They are also experts at maths, but they don't realise it. Sir, we are doing all this for your research. It's a perfect setting. Let's try it out. I shouldn't have gone there. But you did. It was necessary to test my theory. I think you can understand best... ...how necessary it is, to practically test a theory. Was that the only reason, Venkat? I didn't know that, you would interrogate me. I was under the impression that this was a friendly meeting. I get excited sometimes. There's a fine line between genius and insanity. You aren't what I thought you'd be. What did you assume, Venkat? No, stop. Don't tell me. I don't want to know. You tested your theory, what then? Get out of the way. I don't like crowded places. Madam, I have never seen you here before. Why are you so late? I've been waiting for you, my lucky charm. Lady luck is favouring you. Come on, get lost. Hey, who are you? I first looked at this beauty. I am Rajesh, by the way. Come on, handsome, we will make money. 800. Show. I won the game. Hey, good job. From now on your role is fixed. Everyone's eyes should be on you, at the table so that we can signal you. Go near Sid's table. He will kill me. Please save me. Boss. Do you know why I'm called Dagdu? I'm as tough as a stone and I always carry a gun with me. -Get up, quick. -Sir Dagdu. Teach him how to swim in the Mahim sea. Let's go. -Give me one chance, sir Dagdu. -Hey. Sir, he is new here. He has suffered a huge loss. Hello, sir Dagdu. Who is the most beautiful woman today? She is private, boss. Let's play. We'll play a high stakes game. Winner takes all. 500 rupees for me. 500 rupees for me. 1,500 rupees. Blind. 1,000. Pack. Blind. Sir, I'll miss my train. May I go? Hey, what are you saying? You leave. -Move. -Sir, I'm sorry. Blind. Uncle, I will leave. You leave. Don't come here again Get out. This is my lucky game. I will only win this. 2,000 rupees. Show me your cards. 4,000 rupees. Here. Hey what are you staring at? He cracked a joke. Laugh. 5,000. 4,000. Fine. I'm going to win this. Put in 5,000. I've seen the cards. 5,000. 6,000. Add 1,000. Pack. -Pack -I'm certain to win this game. Darling, shall I get a bottle of beer? -10,000. -Can you see this gun? Well, put in 10,000. Show. My first card. Here's an ace. I have a king and a queen too. -Yes, we did it! -You scoundrel! I mean, that was a great hand. What are you doing? Hurry up! Take the money and get out of here. Oh! Should I take it? Excuse me. What was the need for you to come there? Who told you to come there? You've spoiled everything. -He is... -Hurry up, mister. Why are you driving the vehicle so slowly? Hurry up. -Sid, this is... -Oh God! Come on, take him out. What are you doing? -Come on, mister. Sing a song -What? -Give us the money. -Sid! Leave him. Hey, beautiful. No. Thrash him properly. Hey, what are you doing? Stop! What are you doing? Leave them. -He was also there at the casino. -What are you people doing here? Do you want to face the music too? Don't touch me, do you understand? Thrash him! What is going on? Hey, he is singing in English. What's going on? Hey, I'm Dagdu Popat. Even I can talk in English. I'm 10th fail. -10th fail? -Leave please. Thank you very much. What do you think of yourself? All you know is to indulge in hooliganism. Leave her alone. How dare you show me a gun! You go, run away. What is this nonsense? I'm just kidding. Is this the way to behave? Get lost! -Get going! -Quick, let's go. Drive fast. Run away, losers! Sir, they didn't get scared of you. They ran because of the police. Come on, sir. We should also leave. I am sorry. This happened because of me. Sir, I would've killed him had he not had a gun. Bloody ruffians. No, we made lots of mistakes. We should rectify them. First of all, we should not travel, in our own vehicles. We'll never do that after today. Sir, don't you know, that we've earned a lot of money? Dagdu took it away. Yes. Sir, the most important thing, if we crack it, we will redefine the probability theory. -No. -Sir... -We can earn a lot of money from this. -No. No. I don't want to do this type of a research. Sir, my dad has taken a loan for my education. Everyday he reminds me about it. I want to pay my fees with that money, sir. Please. Yes sir and Vikram is also on a scholarship, sir. He is also in need of money. If I get some money, even my life will become better, sir. Sir, the game came to an end because of me. Give me one chance, sir. I know I can do it. I just know I can do it, sir. Please. Please, sir Venkat. No! I will conduct my research by myself. -I don't need you people. -Sir, please. Sir, this money will come in handy, after your retirement. We did what we did, as a part of our research. Money was not the reason. I'm not going to do it. They will reject your paper once again, sir! They will reject your paper again, like they've done each time. Foolish people. But I enjoyed playing cards. They were showing their cards. They were talking to me They talked to me. -Venkat. -Yes. There is a call for you. -Hello. -Hey, master. Who is this? -Bilson Ranga Tiger Appu. Rajan. What is in a name, master? You earned a lot of money at the casino yesterday. See, I think you've dialled a wrong number. I haven't. I know I'm talking to Venkat Subramaniam. You people earned a lot of money, yesterday. Come on. Now do some social work. From now on, I'll be needing my share. Listen, who are you? You listen to me now, master. I will tell you where to meet me. You'll have to pay 200,000 rupees from your winnings in the next game. Do you understand or not? Yes...No. Who are you? Listen... Listen carefully. If you don't pay up, Siddharth Bajaj will lose his leg. Do you understand, master? Don't tell anyone about this. Good morning, sir. Who was that man? I hope this isn't a joke. Only the five of us knew about the game. Who was he? -Yes. -Your next game in Victoria Talkies. I want 200,000 rupees. Keep the rest with you. Please keep quiet. Just think about your students. Everything is in your hands. If you act smart, you'll suffer the consequences. I will go to the police. Think twice before you do anything like that. Phone calls? Photographs? So, the danger was rising. Yes. What did you think? What was the motive? I don't know. There could be many motives. So, nothing was certain. Why didn't you go to the police? I didn't want to put my students in danger. What if one of my students was involved in this? So what reason did you give them, for a change of heart? I told them I needed money. They believed me. Nobody knows what this philosophy is Even the unfaithful become loyal with the power of money Gambling earns you money but you need money to gamble Such is the game Aces, kings, and queens rule the game of Teen Patti This game enslaves everyone Aces, kings, and queens rule the game of Teen Patti This game enslaves everyone One does get scared sometimes but one's aspirations are big One's addiction gets the better of ones senses Gambling earns you money but you need money to gamble Such is the game Gambling earns you money but you need money to gamble Such is the game Aces, kings, and queens rule the game of Teen Patti This game enslaves everyone Nobody knows what this philosophy is Even the unfaithful become loyal with the power of money Aces, kings, and queens rule the game of Teen Patti This game enslaves everyone Aces, kings, and queens rule the game of Teen Patti This game enslaves everyone So much money! Show me the money, dude. We've earned 400,000 rupees. 200,000 rupees is sir's share. As a royalty for his theory. Fair enough. I had invested 100,000 rupees. I'm taking that. 100,000 rupees will be divided into four. 25 thousand each. Well done, everyone. Enjoy yourselves. -Here you go. -Thank you. Sir, even I've become rich today. This is just the beginning. After this we will invest our winnings in the game. Okay? And we keep this to ourselves. Bloody hell! what is this? I thought the money will be shared equally. But we won because of sir Venkat. Sid, forget about money. I will crack it. We won't need their help after that. You and I? Why not? Like... Bonnie and Clyde. Do you think I can do it? Because till now... You are a pretty good actress. You sure can act well. Sorry, I underestimated you. I am loving this game, Sid. For the first time in life, I feel like winning. I don't want to lose, Sid. I love you, Chameli. Really? Bonnie, I think someone is following us. It could either be the police, Interpol or the underworld. -We'll have to run right away! -This is so exciting! Nobody will ever catch us. Shit! Now what? It is Scotland Yard's inspector. Oh. Let's go. That was a narrow escape. Scared, I was. I wanted to know who my blackmailer was. I reached the designated place to pay 200,000 rupees. I didn't know who I was up against. Hey master, leave the bag there and leave. The threatening letters and phone calls followed me everywhere. I felt as if I was being followed, everywhere. I'm so rich! I can do anything I want, sir! Listen, everyone! My house is ready! Wow! Richie Rich, is leaving for the weekend it seems. Switzerland? How much will you charge, to drop me to the bus stop? Let's go. -Badriprasd. -He's upstairs. My sleep was disturbed and I opened my eyes... -Who is it? -It's me. I am a friend of Dhaniram. What is your budget? -2,000. -2,000? Get out. Sir, please... Fear... This beauty doesn't know what fear is. -Oh, it is so late! -Good night ma'am. Gulabo knows only love. Good night. -Yes? -Open the door. What the hell! Who are you? Oh my God! How did you come up? Everyone is looking for us. This is it. Are you ready? We are trapped from all four sides, I hope you aren't scared. Don't be scared. I will not let anything happen to you. Sid, there is danger ahead. But we can't go back now. Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me? Don't you? Abbas. -Stop it. -Abbas, please. Sir Venkat is waiting for us. This Vikram is very weird. I thought Sid and... Abbas. Abbas! Will you play? 1,000 rupees for a ticket. There is houseful in heaven now. There is no place for you. Keep quiet, otherwise... -Here is my money. -2,000. Blind. -I've seen you somewhere. -What are you doing? Take him away. I should not see him here next time. Go now. I'm sorry. My name is Billu. -I've seen you before. -2,000. Where have I seen you? Are you Chillam's man? You must've seen someone else. Where have I seen you? You play the game, friend. I've surely seen you before. I hope I havent seen you at Suzie's place. Wow, is sir Venkat gambling? Incredible! What about Aparna? She's dressed like this? Can't believe it. Do you want to tell me, what's happening? You stay away from her. Do you understand? Don't get any ideas. If you try to act smart, I will... Rockstar, your fly is open. -What is your name? -Jyoti Prakash Pandey. -Oh God! -What happened? Actually, my mom's name is Jyoti... ...and my dad's name was Prakash. You're my dad, and my mom. Jyoti Prakash Pandey. He broke it! Don't fire! Don't fire here! Get him! Get him! -Are you Chillam's man? -No. -Who is he? -He is Nikunj. Do the two of you play together? -The two of you cheat. -No. -Thrash him. -Sir. Leave him. -Is your hangover gone? -I told you to leave him. -Is your hangover gone? -I told you to leave him. -I told you leave him. -Have you come in a group? Have you come in a group? Run! Idiot! Who fired the shot? Who fired the shot? Leave it. Give it to me. Will you get my club closed? This is not a toy? -You will get hurt if you get shot. -Dance, darling. Take this and run from here. Go quickly! Sir, you go from here. Hey! What is your name? What is your name? -What is your name? -Subramaniam My name is Subramaniam. Hey! -Come on! Catch them! Go! Let's go! Run. Fire! let's go, sir! Did you lose the money in the rickshaw? Did you get robbed? You've gone mad! How did you come there? -I followed these two. -Every thing he says is a lie! Did you lose the money? -Idiot! -Siddharth, shut up man! You're responsible for what happened there. This guy dropped gun there, sir. Stupid fellow. We can't go there now. Everyone knows us there. They also know that we're together. It's over. I needed that money badly. I had to make a payment... But sir, the game has just started. Or rather, about to start. You know, you should keep out of this! What you know about these four persons? Sir, I know that you've been playing, for peanuts. Sir, I can take you to places where you will earn in a single game, much more than what you have earned till now. Abbas, what are you trying to say? Private parties, clubs, privately operating casinos... You can win as much as you want. And only I can take you people there. However, when the stakes are high, the risk is also high. There will be cameras everywhere. But we just have to be careful. Are you explaining or frightening us? Be patient. I'll tell you everything. I know that there will be rich and influential people in these parties. They have so much money, that they don't care whether they win or lose. Given how influential they are, the security will be tight. But that's the fun it. No! No! You people have gone mad. Enough is enough! You don't understand. -Sir, come on. -No more. Sir come on, it will be fun. The game will get bigger. Fun! Fun! Whose fun? How much fun do you want to have? There is a limit to everything. This is the limit. Sir Venkat. I think Abbas is right. -You also need the money. -No. -But you had told me. -No, I don't need money. We will not play. Enough is enough! Wow, sir! When you needed money, we played for you. Today, when were in need of money, you're backing out. Sir, please try to understand. We need money, especially me. -Abbas is rich man, sir. -Sir, forget about that. Sir, we will win so much money in one night, that we might not have to go back again. Sir. Sir. Are you fine? Sir, there is a big party on Saturday night. I will arrange for the passes. Raja from Dungarpur. Ravinder Singh, from Punjab. Hi, I'm Sandy, from the Sabarwal family. Have we met? Hi! I am Zinat. Bombay is rocking. Really? Do you understand Hindi? That is amazing! Do you know... -Excuse me. -Hey! This man knows how to live life king size. He is the one who has hosted this party. Oh! His name was Tarun Majumdar. But he now calls himself Tony Milano. He is well known playboy. Oh! I would have never guessed. 90,000 to Zinat. 100,000 for Ravinder Singh. 150,000 for Raja. Do you know where sir Venkat is? I don't think he has come here today. You look for him. This is 100,000 on Raja. Let the game begin! Take her for a walk. Show me the card. Sir, Venkat is nowhere to be seen. I think he has not come. What do we do now? Get out or here right now. No exceptions. Let's go. -I have to leave now. -Hey, sit. Where are you going? 100,000. Blind. Belisima. Please get me a drink. Sure. 1 million. Blind. Pack. Zinat, we'll have to leave right away. Wait, Ravinder! Wait! Your place or mine? Let's go, mister. Okay, tell me... I didn't see his car in the apartment. Not even in the campus. I thought sir wouldnt come. No, I think that something is wrong. -But where is he? -Look. -Sir. -What is this? Sir, where had you been? We almost lost everything today. Shantanu! I've finished my paper! I was celebrating! Have you ever sat in the Victoria? Marine drive. Rain. Breeze. Victoria What a celebration! Sir, you did not answer our question. Why didn't you come? -I was having pani puri. -What? A beautiful ellipsoid of fantastic, edible proportion of pani puri. Sir, it was a big game today. We could've won a lot today, sir. It is essential to lose, in order to win. Shantanu, it is very important to lose. But what will you do, after winning so much money? How much more do you want to earn? Have you not earned enough? And you... What are your needs? You want excitement and thrill, but at what cost? Wow! The female mastermind. You're very clever. I always knew that. Very interesting! Sir, are you okay? No, I am not. I have one problem. One small problem. I want to get to the root of that problem. The root cause is standing right in front of me. One of you is the root cause of my problem. But who? Sir Venkat. -Vikram! -Vikram! Vikram, what's the matter? Sir, I got thrashed badly. Who thrashed you? Sir, who knows everything about us? -Hello. -I want to talk to Venkat. -Who knows everything? -Who is this? Sir, he wants to talk to you. Sir, the bigger the game, the more severe the penalty. What I did to Vikram is just an illustration. Youll have to pay me 50% of your earnings henceforth. If you refuse, I'm capable of doing much more. I'll call you again. I got thrashed badly, sir. If all of you are here... ...then who is he? Venkat, have you lost faith... ...in humanity? No. I haven't lost faith. But... ...it is becoming increasingly difficult... ...to keep faith... ...in a world... ...where no rules are followed. When I was young, I'd gone with my father to watch a famous magician perform... ...at the Royal Albert Hall. Half of London was there. Everyone was anxious to find out what tricks he had up his sleeve. When I looked at peoples faces... ...I saw, that they were determined... ...not to fall for... ...the magicians trick. By the way, I was just 8-9 years old back in the day. I was the most suspicious of his tricks. But suddenly, he did something that I could never forget. He floated in the air. Everyone panicked... ...and started screaming. I tried a lot, but I could not understand the logic behind it. That was the time I realised... ...that to trust... ...is a choice. There isn't a lot of difference... ...between mathematics... ...and magic. The journey starts with curiosity and faith takes us to the destination. And anyway, what is the fun of knowing everything? -How did you... -Quiet. Come on. Let me show you the room where Newton deveoped the laws of motion. Ah! Cambridge, lovely. -Till next week. -See you later. I'm so sorry. I didn't let you finish. -What was I saying? -Something about blackmail. Why would any of us blackmail you? This is ridiculous. You know, I think... ...that we should go, to the police station. No sir, we'll land in trouble. He will kill us. See what he has done to Vikram. I say, let's give him what he wants. 50 percent? -Fare deal. -Let him have it. -We'll look for him later. -I agree. I'll go with your decision. He is earning so much money by making one call. Good mathematics. We have only one mathematical genius in our team. Are you sure you want to submit this? Venkat, retirement is near. Save yourself the embarrassment of another rejection. Night classes are banned on the campus, Professor Subramaniam. There has to be a system... ...which you seem to breaking all the time. Against my better judgement and for the safety of the students, we were compelled to give in to blackmailers demand. We started playing again. Hi, K. You've grown taller. -What is it? -Nothing. Damn it! You are flirting a lot. Stay in your limit. Oh, Sid, you are forgetting, that I am Zinat, not Appu. And Zinat does what she wants, understood Raja? Doctor, I am having so many medicines that I feel that my whole body is a chemist shop. Sir, your drink. Doctor, if I die, my ghost will ruin your life. -Mister Ghosh. -Abbas. K, meet my friend, Mr. Indranil Ghosh, from Italy. He runs an ice-cream business. Not ice cream. I've told you, so many times, friend. Gelato! Good evening. Greetings. I am Ravinder Singh from Punjab, the heart of India. I'm London, Prem London. What kind of a name is that? Don't laugh ma'am. I've a special name. Here is my money. I played a game for 4 million in London for the first time. My life changed after that. That fellow hit a six. To hell... I mean, God bless his mom. Ten. Hello, Mannu. I'd like to bet 50,000 on India. -You play your game. -Yes, sir. 10,000. 15,000 for me. Times have changed. What is left? This money. People spend their whole lives trying to earn the amount of money I've lost this far. But now I'm bankrupt. I have nothing left. Family? Wife left me. 25,000. The name's Kasbekar. You can call me K. No, you are a forbidden pleasure. It's in the air and it is a six. Oh God! We're losing. Hello. India is going to cost me the money. This 20-20 format sucks. My calculation didn't work out. Two overs are left. If India bounce back then the probability to win is 5:1. Anything can happen. 60,000 for me. Hello, why doesn't India bounce back? That man has been hitting sixes at will. Anything can happen. Oh no! It's a big one. Nothing can happen. And what shall I call you? Let me think. Biscottino. Yes. You are Biscottino. My Biscottino. 200,000 for me. 200,000. Indian team is going to ruin me.. I'm cancelling my bet on India. 500,000 on Pakistan. Till when will you play? Come on, let's dance. Yes, please go. She is asking you so sweetly. Let's go and dance. I'm not telling you, Mannu. Concentrate on what I'm saying. I want to bet 500,000 on Pakistan. -Yes. -Pack. What? Show. God is great! India wins! What an unbelievable match! Mannu, you have ruined me. This 20-20 format sucks. Are you alright? It is a game. You win some, you lose some. I think I need a doctor. Somebody get a doctor! Call a doctor! Only someone who is needy, can do anything to earn money. What is your problem? You won't understand, rich man. Yes, I badly need money. Keep quiet, poor man. I am talking about the blackmailer. What happened to you? Give his part to me. Even I'll come for the bag drop off, sir. I might recognise the blackmailer. -No. -Sir. Oh! I see. Yes, my phone is ringing. Do you have any problem? Can't I buy a phone? Everyone has one. But nobody has my number. Hello, who is this? Hello. Sir, he called me and told me, that I should not come there. Bastards! Shantanu. How is this? It is reasonably priced. Listen, I've given you my opinion. It's either the solitaire or nothing. Why are you so confused? Why are you putting me under pressure? You can't blackmail me now. Blackmail? How is this a blackmail? Listen to me. Don't you know, that uncle is orthodox? What new business are you into? Whom are you trying to call? Oh! I am trying to call Pravin. I am trying to repay the loan to lead a peaceful life with you. Look, I am sorry... ...but I need a little more time Tisoromiya. I know you understand. You trust me, right? I know it. Come here, it is alright. I am very tensed. I am not able to explain you. I am unable to focus now. But I promise that everything will change. I promise. Don't look at me like that. Pandya. Oh wait, Pandya! -Shantanu. -Pandya! Pandya! Damn! Venkat, you were right. If God exists, He must be a mathematician. Look at the way He set up the world. Look at the patterns of life. They are just like equations. If the God is a mathematician, we should have answer to every question. We should have proof. There should be equations. Do we have proof and equations for everything? Show me who God is with proof and equations. What is after death? Do you have an equation for that? What's money? It's only a number! Wrong! Money is greed. Can you make an equation for it? Now show it to me. Continuous type. Shantanu... Sir, someone committed a theft in my room. Please see me outside. -What is it? -Sir, someone stole all my money. Who took my money? You must know. You know everything. I will kill whoever did this. I have an enemy here. -I will report it. I will complain. -Who will you complain to? Who will you complain to? Will you go to the dean? Or to the police? How you will explain how you earned the money? Think about it. I don't know who took your money. I told him to take a hike. -Sid, I told him to... -Enough! Now you leave this game. Shut up, Sid. We're having so much fun, arent we? Fun! -You are having fun, I am not. -What do you mean? I've seen how you flirt with people. What kind of clothes do you wear? What is this? You know that I don't... You... You are jealous. Yes, you are jealous. I don't believe this. You are jealous, Sid. Siddharth Bajaj, you are jealous. If you don't stop this drama, Aparna, I will... Drama! Wow! Now you think this is drama! Why? Aren't you enjoying it now? Clyde? Hold your spot. I am enjoying it, Sid. I won't quit this game. You know, it was great while it lasted, Sid. Because I loved being your Bonnie. Biscottino. Biscottino, Mr. Iyer. Welcome to Silicon Valley. -Enjoy it directly from Italy. -Hi, Iyer. Ciao, Iyer. May the best man win. 10,000 blind. No! What are you doing? 10,000 blind, that's the way you play. 10,000 blind. 10,000 blind. 10,000 blind. 40, seen. 40,000. Seen. What are you saying? No way! That's so funny! Pack. What was that about? Show. Phase to three. Sid, where did you go? I was looking for you. -Why did you leave the party suddenly? -Come on! Who has my money? Return my money or I'll kill you. You've got a gun again! Crazy? Yes! What will you do? Put the gun down. Abbas, control your girlfriend, or... -Drama Queen! -What will you do otherwise? Tell me what you'll do. We're waiting, Sid. Sid! -Sid, listen to me! -Sid, stop it! Are you crazy? -Sir, don't come forward. -Give me the gun before you hurt anyone. -Let go of her! -Stop it. Enough is enough! I'll manage everything. Give it to me. Will you manage it? What will you do? What will you manage? You've ruined everyone. Give me the gun. Look at yourself! Who are you people? You are so busy impersonating others... ...that you forgot your real identity. This was an experiment. An experiment between a teacher and students. We were a team. You know, a team! But you know something? The reason behind forming this team has changed. That's what it is. Do you think this life is a game? Is it a game? You love to shoot, don't you? Have you ever seen the bullet used in this gun? I'll show you. Here are six bullets. I'm throwing away five. I'll load one. I'll rotate it now. I'm fixing this. Sir! What are you doing, sir? This is what it is. This is the game we need. You enjoy pointing the gun at others. -Have you ever faced a gun like this? -Sir! I was lucky today, Sid. But I will not be lucky all the time. And if you want to know how lucky you are, here, try it. What? What? I am only a mathematics teacher. Goddamit! fJust a mathematics teacher. I can't teach anyone about life. No one can! One needs to live to know about life. You have to live it to learn it. That's what I was trying to tell them. Was I right or wrong? I don't know. I don't know why. I just don't know. I wanted to know who the blackmailer was. That day. I waited for him. I decided to challenge him. Hey! What is this? -Who are you? -Hey! I dare you to come out and face me. Come out! Hey! Look at this. This is last installment. After this the game is over. Game is over. Professor, do you know the consequences? Come on, let's play one last game. -Give us 10 million more. -No. -Then the game will be over. -No. Okay, professor. Then pay the consequences. Do whatever you want to. I will do that what I have decided. So, darling! How are you? -Darling! -Who are you? I don't want to play this game, sir. Who is this man? Yes, I will play this game. You won and I lost. I lost! The game began in a simple manner. But it got complicated. There was no end to our problems. You didnt know the matter would get so far. No. No, maybe, not. But I was the one, who started this. So, I was responsible for the consequences. The consequences were due to their choices, not yours, Venkat. So, don't shoulder all the blame. Yes, but we have to bear the consequences. No matter what you do, but you can't escape them. It's your turn. -You dance. -It's your turn. Come on, dance! -Come on, keep dancing, baby. Dance! -It's your turn. -It isn't my turn. -You'll dance now. You will dance. You can't make me dance. Keep dancing. Hey! Let go of me! Your pants are torn! Don't do it! You tore my new pants! Don't do it! -Go and bring needle and thread. -Okay. Your pants are torn! Where did you get so much money from? My uncle gave me money. I know. What are you doing? My uncle gave me the money. My uncle gifted me these clothes. They are new. Uncle gave them to me. Did your uncle give you the music player too? It belongs to him. It isn't mine. What are you doing? Don't touch these. He has to deposit the money in the bank. He'll come in the morning. -He was asking about you. -Let go of the money. Let go of the money. Let go of the money. -It belongs to my uncle. -Let go of it! He was asking about you. All of this belong to uncle, right? -Answer me. Come on, answer me. -Yes. We have come to study here! We shouldn't get involved into drinking, smoking and gambling. Because these are bad habits. You would tell me the consequences, right? Do you know the consequences of what you've done? Do you know the consequences of what you've done? I will tell you what the consequences are! I hate thieves like you. I'm disgusted at you. I don't know what to say. Before I lose my head, go away! Just get out of here! Get out of here! What are you doing to me? Please help me. Why are you doing this to me? We'll sort out the matter later. We'll discuss it. Please listen to me. Let's discuss it later. Please don't do this to me. Please listen to me. Please forgive me. I can't keep the money in my room. What if it is stolen again? Abbas, I want to send the money home. You are a coward. Wait! -Come on, Sid. -Sid, please talk to him. Let's show him how to hide money. Wait! Come on! Come on! Let go of me! -Where do we hide it? -Abbas, return it. -Let's keep it on the window. -Return it. It's mine. Some bird will steal it from the window. What about the door? -The sweeper will take it. -Return it! -Abbas. -The drawer. No, Rami may steal it again. Viku, my brother! Where are you keeping it? Anyone may steal it from here. Sid! He has a girlfriend! He has a girlfriend! Sid! What is this? This also had child. This is mine. This is my money. -This is mine. -This is not yours it is mine. Your money was stolen. -You stole my money. -This is my money, Sid. You thief! You stole my money! Is this what you've learnt from your parents? Don't say anything against my parents! My dad didnt ask me to steal anything. I am not a thief! Have you packed woollens? It'll be cold in New York. Don't change the topic. Dad was asking me that if we have... ...decided anything about the wedding... Let's have a monsoon wedding. Do you remember? We met in Kolkata during the rainy season. What's the hurry? Really? What's the hurry? Now that we are engaged, we'll get married too. Should we rush into this? I don't understand. What don't you understand? -Even after seven years... -I need some... I need some time. Okay? There, I've said it. I need some time. You haven't completed Mr. Cherian's assignment. Viku, if you don't mind, may I ask you something? How did you get so much money? Don't look at me like that. Yes, I need money. I need money badly. Faces in the unsynchronised... Interesting! They think they are looking at me. Actually, I am looking at them. From everywhere and every angle. Welcome back, Sunny. How are you? I am alive. You're alive! Have you thought why? Cards, drinks, money... Addiction keeps me from going over, from getting on synchronized. Do you think they're looking at us? Who is that? What is wrong? No. I just thought I saw something. So, what are the good things in life? Good scotch, a private yacht and a villa at Amalfi Coast of Italy. Freedom for the noise in your head. -Good sex. -Amen. A closed second would be riding a Harley Davidson on the highway, while wearing a leather jacket and listening to music. -Biscottino, meet Vicky. -Hi. -Vicky is a wine connoisseur. -Oh, hi. Vicky is my escort to Barbados. Wish us a rocking time. I am sure, well meet again. Don't get lost in the crowd. Until then... I think your Italian needs a little bit more work, darling. It's the only give away. What was that about? So, how about a hundred thousands to rev up the engine? I want to be defined by who I am, not by what I own. And for that, I need to find me. I believe you're aiming for Nirvana. -Pack. -Pack. Nirvana, no. Victory. I want to win everything, including freedom from attachment. That's another thing. Just another thing. 200,000. I don't get it. Pack. 300,000. Pack! 400,000. What is your opinion about human brain? It masters the secrets of science and philosophy. It creates music and literature too. But what is the brain? Is it matter? That's why it can be cooked and eaten, 500,000. Do you leave in destiny, Krishnamurti? Double! Not anymore. Double. I like it. Healthy competition. Double! Show! I played that game to lose it. I was playing with my destiny. Your game. Better luck next time. But you aren't lucky if you have to wait for the next time. Yes, you win some, you lose some. God, please forgive me. Please forgive me. God, please forgive me. Now I get it. You are playing games with me. -Okay, so play the game. -Hey! Wait! Just wait! How long will you run? Where will you go now? You want to hurt me! You sinner! Who is this? Viku! Come in. We were in a mess. By the time we realised it, it was too late. I never understood the greed for money. People go to any extent to find happiness. Do you know why people gamble? I have my theories. Tell me yours. It's a survival mechanism. When we gamble, we just stop caring about anything. We can't control anything. Yet, we decide to risk everything and play. By gambling, we try to prove that we can survive despite everything. Viku! My brother! Please help my brother! Why does a student have so much cash in his room? He was on a scholarship. His family belongs to the lower middle class. It's very confusing, because we are quite strict. This is the key to a locker. There are 60 million in the locker. This key belongs to the blackmailer. His share is also in the locker. Who is it? Shantanu, you read it for everyone. "Dear Venkat sir, Dear Sid, Aparna, Abbas... ...please forgive me." "I needed money urgently." "I thought money could help me earn respect and love." Shall we go to your house or mine? -Do you have cash? -Yes. You idiot! You came to a party without any money? You have only 100! How dare you touch me? Get lost! -But... -You want to touch me without any money! "I felt inferior." "That night, I could've killed anyone for money." "That's when I realised the solution to all my problems." You are stealing money! -Who are you? I am not the thief, you are. You are stealing money from Venkat. -You are the thief. -That's our money. "I understood that they were blackmailing you on someone else's orders." "I made an offer to them. They agreed for that." You work for us I'll pay you double. I need money too. 60-40. If you try to cheat me, I'll cripple you forever. You'll beg for life. "I started earning a lot." "I used to pass the information and they used to call you." "Gradually, they learnt everything and they became as greedy as I was." "I became the slave of the people, whom I sought help from." The game will be over only when we want so. -Do you get it? -"It was hard to stop them." "I was worried that they might..." "I saw Pandya at the party the other night." -You'll threaten me! -"I was scared and I killed him." "I couldn't understand anything." "I had only one choice. I couldn't share it with anyone." "Please forgive me. With a lot of love, Vikram Ashwin Mehra." But who started this? Who did Pandya and Jogi work for? This began due to greed, your greed. -We don't need to know... -You do. I must tell you. I began... ...this blackmailing. I didn't know when Vikram got involved in this. I wanted to stop it. I went to Venkat after the game last night. Sir, I'm really sorry. Sir... Sir, I'm really sorry. My debt was increasing. I can't see any way to get out of it, sir. And suddenly, sir, you, had showed me this game. And I thought that now, my problem could be solved, but you had refused to play. Sir, then I become very desperate. I asked for help from Pravin. Pandya and Joginder. But the day when Vikram got beaten up... That day I had not called you. It was someone else. Sir, that day someone stole my game from me. Your game? Sir. Your game? You rascal! You blackmailed me. Threatened me? Who do you think you are? -How can you do this? How? -Sir... You have ruined everybody's life. You are a teacher! A professor! Did you even realise what games you have been playing, with those kids lives? Sir, I tried to stop it. I realise it's all my fault. Sir, please do something before things get worse. I am really sorry. If I'd have done it earlier, Vikram wouldve been alive. All of you go to your rooms. Get back to your studies. I will do whatever it takes. We need to look into, what ledto this unfortunate incident. The police say that there is a story behind this suicide. It seems that a gambling ring is being operated in our institute. Sir, I want to say something. Well... I am the one... ...who is responsible for this mess, Dr Louis. It all happened, because of my research paper. The same research paper... ...which was not accepted by you. And for that... ...someone should be punished, and it has to be me. So, here is my resignation, sir. I am ready to bear any consequences or whatever the board and trustees may decide. And it's my request to the trustees not to drag this matter further. It is a matter of reputation of the institute. Thank you, sir. To save the reputation of the institute, the dean decided to accept my resignation and he closed all inquiry in the case. We had found 60 million in Vikram's locker. We decided to send that money to his parents. I went back to my village. Everything has a price, Venkat. My journey wasn't any less difficult. Maybe, but at least you got recognition. Your fame, your prestige, your contribution to mathematics. And to earn all that, I lost everything, that was once important to me. Did you call me to feel good about yourself? No, I did not. Then why did you call me here? Because I think you are brilliant. -And because I read your paper. -You what? It's the breakthrough of the decade, Venkat. You must be mistaken. I deleted it. The only certainty is uncertainty, Mr. Subramaniam. Tomorrow, we're giving you the Isaac Newton Award. Mathematics' highest honour. My only regret is that I was unable to tell you sooner. Some matters are best discussed face to face. But how did you come to know, about all this? I am sorry, sir. Please forgive me. This was my last theft. I stole the hard disk and papers. But my goal was noble. Sir, others have forgiven me. But I really need you to forgive me. I am sorry. Hello, sir. Hello, sir. Congratulations, sir. You may be through with mathematics, Mr. Subramaniam. But mathematics is certainly not through with you. Dear friends, it is with great honour and deep respect that I present to you, one such man today. A man whose theorem on Randomness and the Uncertainty Principle proves once again that the human mind knows no bounds on its quest for knowledge. I present to you this year's recipient of the Isaac Newton Award for Applied Mathematics, Mr. Venkat Subramaniam. I stand before you today, humbled in gratitude. But I also stand before you, humbled in failure. Venkat pleaded guilty for the misuse of his theory. He believed that after all this, he wasn't worthy of this award. I come before you to pay homage, not to receive it. I pay homage to the truth that knowledge is power. Power comes with responsibility, a responsibility that knowledge must be used for the betterment of all, not against fellow human beings, not for individual gain. Knowledge must bring us together, not divide us. Venkat also requested that his paper on probability should be discarded. I had awaited with great longing the recognition given to me here today. Waited to experience the pride that its acceptance would have filled me with. But I refuse it. I refuse it. I refuse it. And no matter how many times I refuse, it shall never bring back the life of my student. This knowledge I must live with, live with forever. Venkat said he couldn't accept this honour. Because he lost one of his students during the research. And he had to live with that fact. The university protocol did not allow Venkat to return the prize or withdraw the paper. For the sake of the argument that knowledge cannot and should not be destroyed. That the destruction of knowledge means destruction of humanity. It was gaining of wisdom. Venkat continued teaching in his village and also became a visiting faculty at the Cambridge University. 1n2 = P(n)3 and given n1*n2 = P(n)4. Given n1*P(n)5 1, 2, 3... What is money? Only a number? Wrong! Money is hunger It is a game of life. The heart has conspired against dreams. Millions of wishes are burned to ash The wish is so relentless, that it can't be exemplified What kind of a trial is this? What's going to happen? 'Cause life is a game Thats so strange You never know how the rules may change It's an addiction of this game It's the truth of life Play the game Play the game Play the game Play the game What do you think? This life that you are living Is it a game? Do you think it's a game? The blunder may be a small one But the punishment is the same You just have to play Life is all about winning Losing can mean death Why don't you find out what fate has in store for you? Every moment life changes its hues Because life is a game It's so strange. You never know How the rules may change It's an addiction of this game These are the facts of life Play the game Play the game What is seen, it does not exist And what is not seen, is possible! Play the game It's all a game
