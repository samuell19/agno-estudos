- What he did was so embarrassing. I feel like it was an embarrassment. He cast such a dark shadow over these Games. - There was no robbery, there was no pullover. He lied. - Now, it is an international incident. - This really hit a sensitive spot in Rio. - I've basically been out of competitive swimming since 2016. - What does this mean for his future? For his endorsements? - He's probably cost himself millions and millions of dollars. - After the Olympics I read a headline, "The worst person in the world." And everything that's happened in my life, everyone's been well, where the hell's Ryan Lochte? * Yeah * Aren't you tired, hey * Of all these lies - So, what do you remember about Ryan Lochte? Yeah, about that night in Rio. Ryan, anything to say for yourself? - I *รก*รก*รก up. I'm sorry. - Well, that's a start. * And only the truth can set us free * - It's freezing. All right, let's do this. If I thought about like oh, this is my fifth Olympics and thinking about like the end goal, I think it will just mess up my head. It's basically all or nothing now. - Now, if you're asking with all that's going on in the world why should I care about Ryan Lochte? Eh, fair question. The guy had it all, lost it all and probably deserved to. At his age, he's a long shot to even make it to another Olympics. And he knows that if he doesn't, the last thing people remember about him is the worst mistake of his life. - My entire life I've never really had pressure. Any pressure that was brought on it kinda went through one ear and out the other. This is the most pressure I've ever had in my entire life. Yes, I made a mistake in Rio and I need to earn the respect from my fellow swimmers, from Team USA, from everyone in the world I gotta earn that respect. And if I don't make the Olympic Team they won't see the change that I've made. - What do you think about when you hear the name Ryan Lochte? - Olympics bombshell. - Rio robbery. - Conflicting stories. - He lied. - You'd probably remember one night in Rio. - We got pulled over, he pulled on his gun, put it to my forehead. - And the pointless lie that unraveled into an international scandal. - And here comes Lochte. - You might not remember that Ryan Lochte is one of the great swimmers. - Yeah! - One of the greatest Olympians ever. - These games belong to Ryan Lochte. - Here's a list of every American who has more Olympics medals than Ryan Lochte: Michael Phelps and that's it, that's the list. * Feelin' like a boss - But Ryan Lochte chased the kinda fame you can't find underwater and instead became swimming's first reality TV star. * Everybody wants to be famous * I think it could be me - Oh, my gosh. Woo! * Who else to fall for me - What would I do? - Ryan Lochte, everyone. - You're in my world now. Yeah! * Feelin' like a boss - Swimmer, model and sure, actor. - I know she has a sex idiot for uninhibited experimentation. - No, I'm pretty sure we're in love. - And so, this became the enduring image of a great Olympian. - Breathe, breathe. - Ryan Lochte, America's alpha bro. * Everybody wants to be famous - Yes, I wore those grills, I wore those crazy shoes. * Feelin' a boss - What a time to be you. - There's no complains. - Yeah, exactly, no. - You know, as long as I was swimming fast, I could do anything. * Everybody wants to be famous - Jeah, jeah, jeah. * Wants to be famous - The person that I am today, if I saw that 24 year old Ryan Lochte, I would knock his ass out. I would knock some sense into him and be like, "There's so much more to life than what you have going on right now." To wake up. Caiden, your ornament. Did you show mommy your ornament? Look at that? - Whoa. Is this a picture of you? - Are you gonna go put it on a tree? Let's go put it on the tree, buddy. - How cool. - Yeah. That's you. Yeah, what's the other side? Gator colors? What does a gator do? What does an aligator do? - It took a minute, but at last Ryan Lochte is all grown up. - Nice job, Caiden. - Good job, Bud. Yay, look. - That's right, he's a relatively boring suburban dad. That's his wife, Kayla and their two kids: Son, Caiden and daughter, Liv. - We met out in L.A. - Out in L.A. at a club. - Yeah, at a club. - Yeah. - I know, right? I don't even know what that is anymore. - Yeah, we talked for like eight hours straight. - Yeah. - Of just like family goals and everything, I was just like, "What?" - Yeah, we talked about life. - And we both wanted the same things, which I mean, honestly, one night I was like "Dude, she's a Playboy model, she's not gonna want the same things." But she wanted the same things- - Just because you do Playboy doesn't mean anything. - Well- - There's more, there's so much more depth to something. - I know, but that's what at the, in the beginning- - At the time, yeah. - That's what I thought, yes. But everything changed and I was like, "Wow, she's a keeper. I gotta hold on to this one." Come on, bud. Let's go. Let's go. * Let's go, let's go - We obviously didn't know what the future was going to hold and you know, six months in to our actual relationship Rio ended up happening. Are there setbacks? Obviously, but it's like you have your setback and you pick up and you just keep going. - Now, the Lochtes live in a perfectly nice three bedroom apartment, but once upon a time, Ryan was a poster boy for Team USA. - Look here, whoa! - Making millions and picturing a future that looked a little different. - I woulda thought I'd be multi-millionaire. Like, you know, having a big mansion, driving nice cars, just living life- - No worries. - And just having no worries. There is like frustrations, yes. It's been an uphill battle. At the same time, I have a beautiful family, and that's what means most to me. All right, buddy. Hey, you get a good night's sleep, okay? - Yeah. - I mean, as long as we stick together it will be all right. It'll be okay. After whatever happens this summer, I don't know if I'm gonna hang up the swimsuit. I don't know. And I almost quit after 2016. I was just hanging on for dear life. But it's different now. I'm doing things that I've never done when I was younger. - Chin to hands. There you go. - And I'm just excited to see what I'm capable of doing this summer. - Ryan Lochte is old for a swimmer. He's 35. If he makes it to Tokyo, he'd be the oldest American man ever to swim at the Games. - Back over, down, lift, other side. - It would be his fifth Olympics. - There you go. - But first chance to compete outside the shadow of the greatest Olympian who ever lived. - They are one, two as expected. What order is gonna be? Michael Phelps is gonna win, Lochte with a silver. - You know, a lot of people ask me if Michael Phelps wasn't swimming in the same era, you would be the Michael Phelps. That could be true. - Lochte is gonna win Olympic Gold. - Unbelievable. - It's not hard to be friends with rivals, but we're not like that. I guess our personalities aren't the same. - The two best in the world. - But without him, I don't know if I would be the same competitor. - The rivalry wasn't entirely one sided. The 200 individual medley is a defining test of an all around swimmer. One length of the pool in all four strokes. - Lochte trying to break Phelps' world record. - in 2009, Phelps watched as Lochte took his world record. - There is a changing atop men's swimming. - And two years later, Lochte lowered that record again. - Another showdown between Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte. - In a time that remains untouched nearly a decade later. - The the wall. It is Lochte! - That's a new world record! - A world record! - Ryan was a guy that beat to his own drum regardless of who he was going to be compared to. But in the end it was inevitable that the comparison was going to happen. - The always entertaining Ryan Lochte. - I was not your normal Oh, Olympian, eat, train, sleep. I wasn't that person. I don't like being the same, normal guy. I like being different. - The media crafted two very different characters. Phelps was Captain America. A once in a lifetime combination of talent and dedication. - Phelps has embellished these natural gifts with an unnatural machine-like workout regimen. - While Lochte was described as a fun loving party boy, coasting on natural ability. Even on NBC, did Bob Costas narrate one of those warm, fuzzy Olympic stories? No, that's John McEnroe, fellow rule breaker, reporting from a closet full of custom sneakers. - The bad thing about the coverage about me, especially with NBC is it kinda portrayed me as a person that was gifted this ability to swim fast and not actually having to really work at it, which really pisses me off because I train harder than anyone. - 10 yards to go. - I bust my ass. Woo! - All right, back squat, 12 reps. - Ooh, Dad. Dad. Daddy. Dada? - What? What are you doing, bud? Oh, did you go, did you go poopies? - No. - You did. - No. - Shit. I should probably change him now. - Yeah, probably. - I'm here to workout and Caiden took a big ole' crap. The 25 year old version of Ryan Lochte would not believe the 35 year old Ryan Lochte as I am today. Would not believe it at all. He'd be like, "I do not want that lifestyle." Caiden, no. Leave that there. - No. - Yes. Caiden, hey, you go play. Yeah, you can't play with that. - You gotta run, quick. Daddy. - Yes? - Dada. - Hi. Oh, my heart. - Oh, my heart. - Just like I said. Let's see, on a normal day I wake up around 6:40, leave my house at 7:10. Traffic in Gainesville is just crazy. Eight o'clock I get beat up for two hours, some times two and a half. I have to rush to my son's school. Come here, buddy. Is that a ornament? And drive past my house where my weight trainer is. Get my butt whooped. Caiden. All these cars just so I can get on the road. We drive back to our place. You gotta come help Daddy. - Hi-ya! - Hey, let's put all your toys away. No, no, no, no. We're not playing, bud. You gotta put it away. No? We try to put them both down for a nap. Caiden doesn't like taking naps because that means- Hi, bud. Ryan can't take a nap. Okay, okay. - Daddy. - I get back in my car and I drive over to the pool and I have afternoon practice until 7:00. I'm rushing home to change diapers. I am the diaper duty. Caiden, this is your poop. You should clean this up. Caiden, what do you eat? So, once they go down, Mommy and Daddy go to sleep time. Then I gotta do it all again the next day. Whoa. Whoa, let me see. Look at you, bud. - You look so cool. - Honestly, I'm happier now than I've ever been in my entire life. - Oh, you look so cool, Caiden. Oh, thank you. Is this your glasses? - What's he looking at? Are you gonna wear them? - To see him grow from a rascal to a well mature man and dealing with his rascal, you know, it's very gratifying. Very gratifying. Good, Ryan. Yeah. - Steve Lochte would know what - That's why he's in a lane over there by himself. - It takes to raise a rascal. Growing up, he was Ryan's dad and coach. Though that order wasn't always clear. - See his shoulders? - I see 'em. - He's like a water polo player. - The problem- - Yeah or he's been on- - You can't train. - A surfboard too much. I'd bitch at him about that. - Growing up at the swimming pool I couldn't say, "Dad." I'd be like, "Coach, coach." He'd treat me like a normal swimmer. - He'd be happy if he had a 25 yard warm down and breakfast at Denny's. - Him coming to practice sometimes and being able to watch me swim, he knows the mistakes I'm doing. - Separate the feet. Let the water rush through. - So, he does help out a lot. And him just being on the pool deck and him being able to see his son swim, I mean, he loves that. - All right, so you know what you're doing? - I do. - He's got god given talent and obviously being a swim coach, he spent most of his younger years hanging around me on the pool deck. So, what else is there to do except be a swimmer? - To watch Ryan was very frustrating in his younger years because he was all over the place. He didn't take it very serious. Ryan's first swim meet. He would be blowing bubbles underwater, pulling on kid's legs, hopping over lanes. Yay, Ryan! - Woo, nice job! - Anything that was not training he would do. Wow, what a start. Until he was about 13 or 14 years old. All his life, I always told him, you know, you're good. - Come on, Ryan! Come on, Ryan! - Somebody said, "Well, isn't that great?" And I told Ryan, "No, greatness comes when you break a world's record and win a gold medal in the Olympics." - Lochte's got the lead in lane five, and he might get that first individual Olympic Gold and he might get a world record. He's gonna beat Peirsol here and he's gonna do it all; world record and Olympic Gold. - In Beijing, it was the greatest feeling to see him win and break the world's record. - You can't help but feel good for Ryan Lochte. - And when he did the parade around the pool, he got up on the bleachers and I leaned over the railing and I whispered, "You're great." - I could just see the tears of joy coming from him, and how proud he was of me. And now that I think about it, I want my son to have that feeling for his dad. Watching his dad do something great. - That's one. - There it is. Yeah, that was the time you went from being good to being great. - Gonna start crying? - Uh, no. - Oh, my gosh. That was so long ago. - I love you. - I love you, too. - Everybody makes mistakes. I don't think anybody on this earth is perfect. We are continuing to grow, to become better, and that's what Rio did for him. - Have you thought about the fact you'll have to explain what happened in Rio to Caiden and Liv? - Well, yes. When I talk to my family, like I'm an open book. I'm telling 'em everything. I don't wanna lie to 'em ever. I'm definitely gonna tell my kids everything that happened. - So, what happened in Rio? Well, it's one of those stories where the more people you talk to, the less sure you are about what really went down. We do know that before things got really bad for Ryan, everything was going swimmingly. American swimmers won half of the events held in Rio; 16 gold medals! - And Manuel is going to do it! - Oh! - Katie Ledecky was winning races by about half a mile. - Ledecky is on her way to history. - Michael Phelps returned to win five more gold medals. - No way anybody's gonna catch Michael Phelps tonight. - It wasn't Ryan Lochte's best Olympics, he was nursing a groin injury and his silver hair got more attention than his swimming. - And Ryan Lochte, second Olympic swim here in Rio. - But he did swim the third leg of the winning four by 200 meter relay. - They got the lead they needed. - It was the sixth Olympic gold medal of his career. - And the crowd on their feet. - So, on the night the swimming competition ended, he celebrated, hard. This would prove to be a poor decision for Ryan Lochte. - On this Sunday night, a harrowing experience for American gold medal swimmer, Ryan Lochte and three of his teammates who were robbed at gunpoint- - Jimmy Feigen, Gunnar Bentz- - In Rio early today. - And Jack Conger. - This is the first time we have seen... - A man posing a police officer. - Someone this high profile of this caliber. - Stopped the taxi they were riding in. - Who has been the target- - Tonight, Lochte is describing the ordeal. - Of violence here. - I messed up before that night even started. I was representing the United States of America at the Olympics. A night of celebration by Ryan Lochte turned dark and dangerous. - I shouldn't have even thought about going out and getting drunk. - Gold medalist Ryan Lochte, he was robbed at gunpoint. - Robbed at gunpoint. - Lochte robbed at gunpoint. - I shoulda represented my country the way we were taught. - The group was in a taxi heading back to the Athlete's Village. - While returning to the Athlete's Village by taxi. They were at a party, the cab gets pulled aside. - They took his wallet, they took his money. - It just kinda spiraled down from there. - Lochte posted, "We are safe and unharmed." - Obviously sounds absolutely terrifying. Security has been a major issue here from the very beginning. A lot of crime here. This is absolutely the story, Lewis, that Rio officials and Olympic officials had feared. - It was all my fault and I have to live with that for the rest of my life. - So, what happened in Rio? Well, the story begins just a few hours after the swimming competition came to and end. As the Saturday night ended around sunrise on Sunday, August 14th. - Me and a couple guys after a late night of drinking, we went to a gas station to go the bathroom on the way back to the Village. The doors were locked. Us being guys, we went in the back and went outside on some bushes. There was a little metal sign that was kinda hanging off. I kinda just, I ripped it down and it made some big noise. - When we got back in the cab, two guys came out and told us to get out of the car. They had guns. - We don't know who those guys were. Two guys in a foreign country come up and pull guns out on you. No military, no nothing. - I was so drunk, I just got a gold medal at the Olympics. When they told us to sit down, I immediately I got up, and I'm like, "I'm not sittin' down." Like, "You're not gonna do anything." - We had to give 'em money. Now, you can say whether they wanted the money to pay for the sign, they wanted, it was extortion, robbery, like we don't know. All we know is that once we gave 'em the money we were able to leave. Now that I look back at it, something coulda happened that coulda ended my life just like that. And it was because I was stupid. - I was at the hotel, I think he was in a taxi. And I do remember him calling me and I could tell by his voice how frightened he was. Saying that somebody just held a gun up to them, like I couldn't even, he couldn't even talk. - Kayla was with Ryan's mother in a Rio hotel room. At about 7:00 a.m., Ryan called on the way back to the Athlete's Village. - I was still hammered, I was still drunk, and I guess my mom overheard it and then she was on a bus going somewhere and she said it I guess to a reporter. It just went, it went viral. - We do have some breaking news from Rio and the Olympics. - This just came into us, Ryan Lochte's mother said that their wallets were taken, but he was fine. - By 9:30, Sunday morning, three hours after the incident, news is breaking that the swimmers had been held up at gunpoint. At this point, what happened is still just a story, not a scandal. It wasn't too late to set the record straight. That is not what Ryan Lochte did. - It was a Sunday morning, we've got the weekend off and we see Ryan Lochte. Oh, my gosh, held at gunpoint, gas station. It's a day off, so we go to the USA House. And as I'm walking into the USA House I look down the street and I see Lochte just bumbling along down the sidewalk, with the dyed hair and the whole thing. I mean, he was buzzed still. The waft of the vod' was pretty strong. And then, so I said, "Hey, would you mind, could you tell me this story on camera?" And I think we can just do it in my phone. - Go. - So, what happened? You were held at gunpoint last night? - Yes. - Look, it's him. - What happened? Who were you with? What time of night? Who pulled you over? - Well, I was with a couple swimmers. We were coming back from the training house and we got pulled over in our taxi and these guys came out with a badge, a police badge. No lights, no nothing, just a police badge. They pulled us over, they pulled out their guns, they told the other swimmers to get down on the ground. They got down on the ground, I refused. I was like, "We didn't do anything wrong. So, I'm not getting down on the ground." And then the guy pulled out his gun, he cocked it, put it to my forehead. He said, "Get down." and I was like, I put my hands up. I was like, whatever. I mean, he was like four or five feet away, but I told, I embellished the story making it look like it was worse than what it was. - But he left your cell phone, he left your credentials? - He left my cell phone, he left my credential, but he took my wallet and he took all the guys' cash. - Did he mention why they pulled you over? - No. - I felt like we didn't have a lot of time. And the video is one minute and 40 seconds before the USOC saw us across the street, came over and shut it down. - It's unlike anything I've ever seen before. - Ryan Lochte. - The instant Lochte's interview with Billy Bush made air, Lochtegate became the all consuming global headline of the Games. - Ryan Lochte stood up to these guys. Honestly, that was a brave and dangerous thing to do. - Rio's problems with crime and police corruption were major concerns before the Olympics began. And so, Lochte's story of being pulled over by men holding a police badge invited close scrutiny from Rio Police Chief Fernando Veloso. - Police officers, they have a tendance to see a lie everywhere, right? He pointed to Brazil, to Brazilian Police and he said, "I was victim of a crime." Investigators went to see what happened and at the very first moment when they saw the image of the cameras of the gas station, they noticed there was something strange there. - Big questions are suddenly being raised about the alleged armed robbery of American swimmer Ryan Lochte. - The American's account of what happened being questioned by authorities. - Details of the story don't match up. - A big lie like this told to the entire world damaged the image of the whole country. - Lochte didn't stick around for the investigation. He flew home two days after the incident on a flight he says was already booked. But it appeared to be another in a chain of bad decisions to split town with his three teammates still in Rio. - One quick question. - Not gonna interview you. - Did it happen? - Breaking news to report two U.S. swimmers pulled off their flights by Brazilian authorities. - This is stunning, this is American Olympians apparently interrogated for hours, their passport seized. - Gold medal winners boo'd and shamed there in Rio. - I remember watching on the news my teammates not being able to leave. I just remember being like, I should be there with them. Like this is all me, not them. - Gunnar Bentz and Jack Conger were questioned by police today. - Third swimmer, Jimmy Feigen agreeing to donate roughly $11,000 to charity to get his passport back and leave Brazil. - In public statements, Police Chief Veloso said the swimmers entered the bathroom and damaged a mirror and soap dispenser. But, while evidence of the torn poster was visible days later, there was no sign of damage to the bathroom. - Reports say badly damaged, but we can see no sign of that now. - The charge eventually brought against Lochte wasn't directly tied to his behavior at the gas station. - These guys came out- - Rather, authorities claimed that Lochte's interview with Billy Bush- - No lights, no nothing. - Constituted the false reporting of a crime. - Just a police badge. They pulled us over. - The swimmer's taxi was never pulled over and the athlete's wallets were not taken. - What he did was so embarrassing. I feel like it was an embarrassment. - But now, it is an international incident. - In a matter of days, Ryan Lochte had gone from victim to exhibit A of entitlement and privilege. - I have no dog in the fight here, but you guys both seem to be very hopped up that Lochte has done the ultimate, the worst thing. - Yes, I feel like all of these other athletes have had this incredible moment to shine and sadly, we've been focused on this ridiculousness. - The truth is, that bathroom was never broached. There's no broken soap dispenser, there's no broken mirror. It was never entered. So, what happened? Well, I mean, it wasn't a fine moment for Lochte. They didn't get pulled over with guns drawn. They went over to go to the bathroom, and they went back and the bathroom was locked and so they peed outside. What they did do was pull down a loosely attached poster, then they had to pay for the damage of the poster they pulled down with guns drawn. Now, you can call that restitution for damage or you can call it a shakedown. - We got worked up as we were- - Yeah. - Coming on the air. You said, "Well, he didn't quite lie." And I said, "No, no, wait, wait, wait, he lied." He lied to you. - Yeah. - Lied to his mom, he left his teammates hanging while he skedaddled. - He certainly lied... Right. - About some details. - No, no, he lied. No, Billy, Billy. - Some details? - Not some details. - There was no robbery. - Okay, there was no robbery, there was pull over. Nobody cocked a gun- - There was no gun cocked to his head. - To his head. - Hold on, just... He lied. - Okay, calm down, listen. Who amongst us has not gone to the bathroom outside or behind a public facility or something if the door was locked? I don't know if you're the person that would never do such a thing, please stand and be recognized so we can all applaud the wonderful person you are. - He lied. - Sure, he embellished at that point. - No, no, no, no. - Money unwillingly- - He didn't embellished. - Came out of his pocket. - He lied. - Al. - They were not, he said their car was hit. - That's not true, that's a lie. And they weren't sideswiped. - So, he created all of these moments to make himself look like- - Okay. - You know, I've stared them down in the face. It was like you said, the "Dirty Harry" moment- - Look, you look- - I mean, come on. Ryan Lochte should speak out. - I think what the USOC did. - I think he owes the Brazilian people an apology. - In the end, he became the villain de jure and he was perfect profile for it. - What about the people of Rio? You know, they dealt with all the headlines going into the Games and here comes this story with one of the highest profile U.S. athletes saying, "I got held up at gunpoint." What would you say to them now? - How sorry I am. They have my deepest apologies. - Do you think if you stay in the sport and they allow you to keep swimming and you go to Tokyo and you perform well, can you begin to erase the damage to your legacy that's been done? - I think so. I know so. So, when I got back home we couldn't go outside. Every news camera was knocking on the door. People saying, "I wish you were dead." "You should not live." Like death threats, "You're a disgrace to everyone." "You're the worst person in the world." I just remember breaking down and crying and being like, I don't wanna be here anymore. Like, I wanted to leave, go on a remote island where no one could ever see me again and just be gone. But Kayla was the one that pretty much knocked some sense into me. - We all have taken a beating from his antics and he knows that. I have nothing to say. He's his own person, he says all he needs to say. - She started losing job opportunities, fans would send her hate messages. When all this happened we were only dating for like what, six, seven months? And I was like, she's gonna leave me for this, but she stuck with me. I guess she saw something that I didn't even see in myself. And said you're a fighter, you're gonna keep fighting this, and we're gonna do it together. - Excuse me, hey, back off. Excuse me. - Get outta here. - For Lochte, getting back to life as usual meant a return to reality television. - All right, we're gonna, we'll take a break. - But there was no escaping the reality of what he did in Rio. - Get outta here, come on. Get out. - And protestors crashed an early live appearance on "Dancing with the Stars." - All right, we're gonna- - All right. - We'll take a break, we'll get the rest of the judges comments. Take a deep breath. - I couldn't tell you even if there was a gun to my head. Which there isn't, but- - You've just received a 10 months ban by the U.S. Olympics Committee. - There's a lot of people saying that they think the punishment was too harsh. - Do you think that's unfair? - I have no comment. - Rio had cost Lochte his reputation. A 10 month suspension cost him time, and it all cost him money. - Ryan Lochte is being hit in his wallet. - Ryan Lochte is likely going to lose somewhere between five and $10,000,000. - Speedo and Ralph Lauren have announced they're dropping their sponsorships. - I went from making millions to zero. Losing every sponsor I've had. The way I was going, I was just going in a dark hole. I was just going down, down, down. What book do you wanna read? - That one! - This one. - Yeah. Where are you? - Getting pregnant threw us viral. Rio happened in August and I got pregnant in like September, October. It happened so fast. And I was 25, so I was just like, I'm not ready. Like I just, this isn't what I want right now. Like I at least need some years here. - Where are you? Right there, there you are. - Right there. There's Waldo. - Yeah, that's Waldo. - I think Caiden was almost like the thing that we needed to pull us together. - We're married and now we have two beautiful kids. We're a team and we decided like if we're gonna do this, we're gonna do this together and we're gonna get out of it. And we're trying to get out of it. - All right, very good. - I moved back to Gainesville because if I was gonna do another shot at the Olympics, I wanted to do it right. I wanted to be back where my swimming career started with my old coach. Gregg Troy is the guy that got to where I was. Getting 12 Olympics medals and he knows how to push me. - Guys. - Yep? - You gotta stand back or I'm gonna kick you out. - Gregg Troy is about yay high and he is the only person in this entire world where I am terrified of. I'm 35 years old, I've been training with him since 2002, and I'm still so scared of him. So, basically me wanting to come back after 2016 and train here, he was like, "I am not training a 20 year old Ryan Lochte. If you come here, I am gonna train a 35 year old Ryan Lochte. Like you're here to train and that's it. If you mess up, you're gone 'cause I don't have time for this." And I was like, "I'm 100% in." - Nice tight stream lines. Feet separated on the turn. Let's get those knees apart on the turn. I don't wanna deal with a 35 year old college kid. And there's been a few bumps along the way, but the last six months he's been really on top of things. It's really good. It'd be unusual for someone his age to make the team. But by the same token his training's been good, he's in a good spot. - Nothing is set in stone. You can't say, "Oh, well, I'm going to Tokyo." No, you have to make the team. The group that I'm training with, I mean, I'm training with the fastest swimmer in the world, Caeleb Dressel. - Imagine being 35 years old. You're tired from chasing around two kids all day, and then you get to come to practice and compete with this guy. Caeleb Dressel is 12 years younger than Lochte. He'll be a favorite to win multiple gold medals in Tokyo. So, swimming next to Dressel gives Lochte a target, and a chance to test himself against the kind of swimmer he used to be. - I have someone that can push me on a daily basis. Everyday, day in, day out, that is just as hungry as I was when I was a little kid. And I see that fire in him and it brings it out on me now that I'm 35 years old and I love it. - Well, there's no doubt that Ryan's Olympics is going to be the Olympics Trials this year. It's not the Olympics. Every single other Olympics it was just a breeze right through it. So, he is definitely in a vulnerable stage right now. He's no sure shot to make it. - A nice little 3.5 mile run to finish off the day and I'm feeling great. Let's keep this going. Get yours. - Two years after the Rio Olympics, Lochte had started to put his life back together. - A little more straight. - His Rio suspension had ended. - Yay, yay, Caiden. - Caiden was a year old. - You threw up all over daddy. - And he was preparing for a return to competition. And then he posted this photo on Instagram. - Time now for sports and a lesson on oversharing on social media. Everyone does it, but 12 time Olympic medalist Ryan Lochte probably regrets this one. - Ryan Lochte locked out of swimming. - It was another Ryan Lochte stupid mistake. It's another one of my things I messed up. - The photo showed Ryan and Kayla receiving a Vitamin B12 infusion. While Ryan hadn't taken an illegal substance, the volume of fluids he received required a special exemption. He was suspended for 14 months. A harsher penalty than he received for the events in Rio. - I have a statement. I just didn't know this was not allowed. Most athletes do not either. If I did, I never would have done it. It's obvious that I would not have posted a picture. As a result of my violation, I am accepting the sanction that will run through July 24, 2019. Meaning I will not compete during that time. This is gonna make me just more fuel for my fire and I will be there in 2020. - It really did suck, but I felt like he started to gain his confidence back and then he just got like it pulled out from underneath him again. And you're just trying to do better. You're trying so hard and to keep getting knocked down. I mean, at what point do you say like, "I gotta keep going of just F this, dude." You know? - There's people that actually take steroids that are not even banned and I get a 14 month for taking Vitamin 12, but nonetheless, rules are rules and I obey by them, so this year, no suspensions. Knock on wood, still, we're going strong and it's gonna be a good year. Yeah, daddy, woo, woo! - A February swim meet at the Orlando YMCA isn't the most obvious place to find an 18 time world champion. This meet is mostly for amateurs and age groupers. But Lochte needs the reps. He's barely raced in the nearly four years since Rio. - I'm racing against anywhere from 13 to 20 and then you see and then you see my name where it's just 35 and it's like grandpa. - You see him? He's not in the water yet. He's getting ready. He's getting ready. There he goes, in the water. - We've gotta see what we gotta do more of. - Come on. - And get more detailed for the events he'll be racing for the Olympics trials. - Lochte raced four finals. - He's shorting up though. That's not good. - His only win came in the 200 IM. - All right. - Caiden, hey! Did you watch daddy? Yeah? Good job, Dada. - How'd that feel? - I survived. - You survived, yeah. - It was all right. It was, I feel like I'm drowning though. - You're low, everybody- - Everything and everyone is low. - Everybody's low in the water, which is good. That's where you wanna be right now. - I know. - You're in a perfect spot right now at this meet. Perfect spot. - Well, I don't feel it. - Well, you don't feel it. Of course, every time you race you wanna feel really, really fast, but that's not the name of the game. The name of the game is June. - What's up, buddy? - The man, the myth, the legend. - You okay? - I mean, I'm hanging in there. I'm doing more than I've ever done when I was in college. - Sounds about right. - Like more yardage and I'm like, I'm 35, I can't be doing this, but- - I know, but it's gonna pay off though. - I think it's gonna come together. - It will. - I hope so. - Either way and I sincerely mean this, I'm so proud of you, man. - Thank you. - You've been through hell and back and you know- - It's my last journey. - You're on the other side. - I have everything I ever wanted. - Well, that's what it's all about. - So. - Yeah. - Post Rio, he was the most hated person in America. That made me sad, it really made me sad. I'll tell you a story. Ryan Lochte came here to my facility and we had a big meet going on. Dude, we had 1,500 kids here and somebody sees him and for the next three hours he signed autographs and didn't leave this building until 11 o'clock at night. That's the kind of person that I saw Ryan be to younger kids. - Hi. - How's it going? - I don't know if you remember, but I took this photo with you when I was little. - Oh, wow! You were so little. That is amazing. That is awesome. - I was wondering if we could do like an upgraded one? - Yes, of course. I probably signed over millions of autographs. I've never said no to a fan. What's your name? - Nice to meet you, I'm Ryan. Ryan Reynolds. - Ryan, oh! Nice, I like it. - Yeah, Ryans are the best. - After Rio, the thing that hurt me the most was reading social media and having little fans, little girls, little boys that like looked up to me being like, "You used to be my role model and now you're not." Um, I think that was the hardest thing. - In the years after Rio, Lochte became a punchline, abandoned by fans and sponsors. His endorsement opportunities were limited. - Okay then, time to go to work. - When life happens. - But as Tokyo approached, he signed a deal with TYR, a swimwear brand that sponsors some of the sport's biggest stars. - Ready and action. - I wanted to set my goals for 2020, so I needed a swim sponsor and TYR was like, "Yes, of course. Let's do it." - That's good. - This is the fun part. Why do they do this to us? This is the bad part. In between you taking shots, they leave the food here so you just keep eating. I've been actually doing really well. No junk food, no soda. And I come to photo shoots and it's just sitting there and I'm like,. Back to work. I don't know if this is my next shot, but. - What was the most out of shape you got after Rio? - Aw, shit. All right, well. Um, the most out of shape I've gotten. August 1st, I went to 217. - We are about to see the return of Ryan Lochte. First major meet in over three years for Lochte. - At the Olympics I was racing around like 188. I raced at 217 at Nationals. - He's from Gator Swim Club, Ryan Lochte. - I kept on eating everything, but it didn't go off. It just kinda stuck right there. - Says he wants to prove everyone wrong. That's why he's coming back to swim. In his return to the sport at the major level, Ryan Lochte is a winner once again. The National Champion here in 2019. - Welcome back, Mr. Lochte. - Ryan Lochte! - Does winning that National Title feel a little bit differently to you as well? - Hold on. This was a lot easier 10 years ago. Um, yeah, it feels good to be back and racing. To be back in the sport that I love. So, I'm really happy to go out there and get a win, but I gotta lotta ways to go for 2020. - All right, Ryan, congratulations. - I was 217 in August and now I'm 187 and I feel great. - In February, the Lochte's moved out of their apartment and into a more spacious home. - What's this? - New sponsors were calling. - Let me see it. - The Games were coming into focus. 2020 was shaping up to be a great year. - Movers came this morning. So, I mean as you can see, it's chaos. - What are you gonna do right now? - Um, I don't know. Just wander around until someone tells me to do something. - Well, do something. - Honestly, I think we could have all this done by later on this afternoon and then we can start on... What, don't give me that look. It's my wife giving me a dirty look. - I didn't give you a dirty look. I gave you, you're very optimistic. - What, I think it could happen. - Um, okay, then you better get to work, buddy. - Ugh. - White chairs. - Bathroom. I did the counting today, we've moved five times since 2016. This is the fifth time. - Any parent, they wanna give the best lifestyle for their children and my poor choices that I've made in my past have kinda hindered that. But since last summer, everything's been going really good. We're in a very good place. This is 2008 Olympics, Athens, Greece. 2004, London. 2016, Rio. And there's one missing, hopefully it'll be Tokyo 2020. - Breaking news tonight, COVID cases are exploding. Doubling every few days in some communities in this country. - Dire new warnings about the spread of the virus. - No state, no metro area will be spared. - States struggle to contain the deadly outbreak. - The virus continues to spread as the Summer Olympics may be delayed as Coronavirus surges worldwide, disrupting the lives of athletes trying to train. - Ryan is watching the news. We are waiting for an update. Okay, honey, so what's your opinion on the Olympics? - It's uh, honestly I don't know. It's a crappy situation. - Mm hm. - I mean, I don't like it. I was, all my training that I've done, I'm ready. - Yeah. - I'm ready to do this. - The social distancing must continue through the end of April. - Across the world, fresh panic. - This morning, an unprecedented postponement. Olympic Officials deciding the Tokyo 2020 games won't happen until 2021. - So, we are joined now by six time Olympic Gold Medalist, Ryan Lochte. Now, that it's being postponed are you fairly confident you'll be able to pull it off next year and qualify? - Um, well, I'm not getting any younger. So, this is definitely gonna be, it's gonna be hard. But like, everything that's going on, like the main focus is having this entire world like come together and stay safe and healthy. Like that is the most important thing right now. And then when we get through this, which we will 'cause we always will get through this together, and then we can go celebrate the Olympic Games. - Amen to that. It's good to see you again, brother. - Oh, thank you. - Glad to hear you're hanging in. Good luck on Tokyo 2021. - Yes, thank you, thank you. Hello, hello. - Hey, Ryan. Just heard the news about the Olympics. - I mean, I am bummed now that it's out there and the Games are actually being postponed. It's really frustrating 'cause you know how hard I've been working. Everything's leading to me doing my goals. The goals that I want for my fifth Olympics. - The biggest thing about you, Ryan, is your determination. When you have a goal in mind, nothing stops you. - Thank you, Dad. - How are the kids? The kids are doing good? - Kids are doing great. I'm spending so much quality time with them. - Yeah, yeah. - And it is just so much fun like hanging out, like I understand how you feel when I was growing up. It's awesome. - My husband is living his best quarantine life. Quarantine shoulda been his middle name. He's a professional. - There you go. - This should be Making Ryan Lochte nachos. - Whoa. - So beautiful. - Pool's closed and the kids are asleep. Time for a little garage workout. Nothing is ever perfect. So, there's always gonna be something that steers you off track. This whole thing that's happening is bigger than me. It's bigger than the Olympians. If this falls short for some athletes, it's heartbreaking. I have to look at the positive side now. So, you're gonna give me an extra year of training under my belt. I'm just gonna become a better swimmer because of this and I have more fuels for the fire because I was so pumped for this summer and now it's being postponed. It's just a blessing in disguise. - So, should we give her the cake now? - I actually still think how did I get here? In a neighborhood of like just kids running around and just being like the family man. Like look at this boy. Oh, get over here, boy. Get over here. Like I have a beautiful family and it's awesome. * Happy birthday to you * Happy birthday to you - Nothing is guaranteed. * Happy birthday dear Liv - You can't take anything in life for granted. * Happy birthday to you - It's not hard to picture a very different version of the Ryan Lochte story. - The guy pulled out his gun, he cocked it, put it to my forehead. - Before the scandal. Before the gas station. Before the all night bender that started it all. Imagine that Lochte's Rio Olympics ended here. - Ryan Lochte, second Olympic swim here in Rio. This is clear sailing now for the United States. They got the lead they needed. What a night. - With a sixth gold medal and a hall of fame career and a final celebration with Michael Phelps. - Ryan Lochte picks up his 12th career Olympic medal. - You just received a 10 month ban. - He never would have been the most hated man in America. I'm sure it would've saved himself a ton of pain. - He lied. - What he did was so embarrassing. - Would his life be better or worse? Who knows? * Happy birthday dear Liv - But it might not look like this. * Happy birthday to you - Yes, yes! - Yeah. - Yay! Get it. Get it, sissy. I used to care so much about what people thought about me and me trying to always please everyone, and I can't please everyone. My job is to please my family. - Need sissy looking, Sissy! - But all the gold medals and all the world records and everything that I've done my past... Look, look. Was success, but in a different life. * Now I know that I've done wrong * - Ryan Lochte came on like a rocket. * But I'm gonna keep trying, trying, trying * - Jeah! * They have lost so many times before * * I'm gonna keep fighting - Ryan Lochte may always be remembered as that guy who did that thing in Rio. - I keep getting back up and I keep fighting. - Maybe he can change that in Tokyo? Or maybe he'll never swim at the Olympics again. - Ryan Lochte! - And maybe for the first time, that's not what's most important. - Oh, yeah, oh. * I'm just gonna wade through the water * * And let every wave wash the darkness away * - I could sit here and say I'm a changed person, but I don't have any regrets. Everything that's happened, it made me who I am today. This is my life. This is who I am now. - So, now, what do you think about when you hear the name Ryan Lochte? You're not quite sure? Well, that's a start.
