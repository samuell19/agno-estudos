Greetings Mr. Dawood! - Greetings! What have you brought today? This is a plate, and this is a sweet made of gram. And it's to be eaten. What's there to laugh in this? Very nice! Did you prepare it? No, mother! So father said send it to Dawood. Must have lost the taste in his mouth by eating from the market. So, mother said, do make him eat in front of you. There! Time to go to the office. So, shall I go? Of course! Let me dress up. Okay! Tell thanks to father for the sweet. This watch has become my enemy. You go! Go! - Going! Greetings, mother! - Why have you stopped there? Go! Get my dress, quickly, mother! As it is I am late. - Okay, take! - What are you doing? So quickly it's 8 o' clock, now a days. What is this? Easy! Easy! I can never find the right way to this dress. Why are you wrestling with the dress? As it is I am late, mother. If I miss the 8:13 bus, Lala Fakirchand will fire me so bad... ...that I won't feel hungry. Yes! How much do you eat? Will the grain prices fall in the city if you don't feel hungry? Okay, mother, I am going! Bye! Eat something and go! - No! I'll miss the bus. Look, Dawood! If you don't bother about eating, then take out... ...my 6 month's rent, and vacate the room! Look mother! Scold me as much you may want to. But send me away from you. Okay? Who else do I have, in this world, than you? Then eat! Fine! I'll eat on the way. Okay? - Alright! Wait! Wait! What's it, mother? I am getting late! Take this! Take this 5 rupees! Have your lunch too. Take! Why don't you come in line, brother? Everyone will get a seat. You'll just keep pushing. Strange! Brother! - Okay, master! Someone has felt behind. Whose is this? 'Band Darwaza' (The closed Door). Kainat Mirza. Silver beach, 55 Juhu, Bombay. Yes, tell me! I wish to meet Kainat Mirza. I am Kainat. Sorry, I never knew you. But, I still did not recognize you. My name is Dawood. Dawood Ali Khan Yusuf Zaid. Well! You have such a lengthy name at such a young age. Thanks! I am such a mad. I left the manuscript of the novel in the bus. Greetings, Mr. Lala! - Greetings! Greetings! Greetings, Mr. Lala! - Greetings! There is a new edition of Krishna Sopti. Greetings, Mr. Lala! - Be blessed, Fatima! Dawood! Hasn't Dawood come? Greetings sir! Sorry for being late. Say sorry later. First I want the list of... ...books published this month. I'll get it right now! Greetings, uncle! - Greetings! Send Mr. Suleman to me, when he comes! - Okay! Just a minute, Mr. Hafiz! Where's the list? List. Dawood, come here! Come! Come! I've made hot snacks. Come, be seated! I haven't seen my mother. But, even if she were to be.. ..she would never have loved me more than you. No nonsense! Take, have snacks! Dawood, you get married now. Marriage? - Yes. Mother, I'm not able to manage myself in 700 rupees. Where will I keep my wife? - To hell with such a job. What else will I do? I suggest, get married to Nadira. To Nadira? - Yes. Yes, he was saying, "if you find some... ... good boy, go to Haj after giving the girl and the shoe shop to the son in law." Did I do my M.A to be selling shoes? No! You did M.A to be beaten with shoes. By selling shoes your degree papers might spoil, isn't it? Then you keep taking the beatings of people. Mother, what all will you bother about me? Eating, drinking, staying, and now of my marriage too? Yes. Leave this marriage thing to me. One day I'll get you such a daughter in law, you'll be amazed. Really? - Yes. Brother Salim, please make the bill. Okay! You? - Greetings! Greetings! How come here? You had said that... ...you publish books at your place. - Yes. So, I thought why not take advantage of your source. Well! What am I worth? I am just a... At least you'd be worth referring me. Possibly, my novel might get published from here. Com in! - Come! Sir, she is madam Kainat Mirza. Greetings! - Greetings! Be seated! Thank you! Hey, Dawood! - Yes sir. You too be seated! Thank you Sir. Sir, Kainat Mirza is a fantastic writer. Dawood is applauding my handwriting. Whatever you'd be writing would surely be good. Such sense of humor, we only get to see rarely. Thanks! Well! What do you write? Don't know! But I had read somewhere that everybody has a novel in their life. So, I wrote it. But I don't know if, what I have written, is a novel or not. Sir, I have turned it here and there to see. Whatever she has written would not just be a novel, but a good novel. If it's a good novel, then why have we not printed it, yet? That's why we have brought her to you. Look, Miss. Mirza. Please call me Kainat. As per our traditions... Sir! - Yes. Excuse me, Mr. Salim, in the shop... Listen! - Yes, sir! Please tell for the tea! - Okay sir! Dawood! - Yes, Mr. Lala! Pack this and keep it there! Okay! - Yes! Won't you take your salary today? Yes, Mr. Lala! Without a salary how will I eat? My bad days begin right from day one of the month. Who was that madam? She's a new writer. New and beautiful too. Excuse me! What happened? He has kept the novel. He said he would read and inform. That's a nice news! You can say you've won half the battle. Do you plan to offer sweets or not? Sweets? You come to my house.. ..I'll treat you with Lucknow cuisine, made by my mother. Mouth is watering. Surely I'll come. Okay, bye for now! - Bye! Dawood! Mr. Dawood! - Sir! I am going to meet Mahinder Singh Bedi. Okay! - Will not come back to office. Okay! - Anyways, I am busy for few days. You do one thing. That madam Kainat Mirza who had come... ...you know? - Yes! Read her manuscript. Give me your opinion about this. Okay! - In few lines. I'll see the rest. Nice girl! Listen, Miss. Kainat! Listen! What happened? After you left, Mr. Suleiman gave me your manuscript to read. I came running to tell you this. - Thanks! That's a good news. I'll read and tell the good news. Well! What's your subject of your novel? Courtesan! Can I ask why you have taken this subject? Is there anything bad in it? No, nothing bad. Normally, the writer take up issues that are known to them, or understood. I don't think you know so much about Courtesans... ....that you can write about them. Well, Mr. Dawood! It might be bad to hear. But it is an absolute truth. That, every woman in the world is a commodity. Whether she's sold at home, or in the market. Sometimes she's sold for money. Sometimes to make a family. Sometimes she's sold by herself, by her own will. Sometimes she is sold away. So, Mr. Dawood, if you see. Every woman is a courtesan, in a way. I cannot say that your thought is right. But it does carry weight. About the novel, I can only tell after reading it. But I am sure it's interesting. - Thanks! Talking away, I didn't realize. Look, I've reached home! So, good bye! No way! Unless you don't come inside to have a cup of tea, God will neither protect you nor me. Oh no! Never disappoint god! Come! - Okay! Mother! Mother, this Mr. Dawood. Greetings! - Be blessed, son! Be seated! - Please come! Mother, Dawood is helping me to publish my novel. May god bless you, son! If her book be published, if we have some money. Then we can get rid of our bad times. This, whatever you see, is all a show. Kainat's father had made many. But he suddenly passed away. We have this house left. That too a rented one. Forget it mother. Why talk sad things? I had promised tea to Dawood. I'll get it right away! - Just like that. You wait! I'll see! Waris Ali, you come later. I have a guest at home. A guest. So what should I do? Give me the rent, I'll go away! We'll give your rent. Where you've waited so many days, wait some more days. Why should I wait? Waris Ali, we have nothing to give you now. Then you vacate the room! If you don't have money, why don't the mother-daughter stay in slum? You are such ill-mannered man! Don't you have manners to talk to women? Sir, I am not here to learn mannerism. But to take money. What? The money! If your heart beats, then you give it. How much is it? - Of seven months, rupees 350. The house is the subject. If it's vacated today, 2 lakh rupees will come by. 2 lakh rupees will come by. Take this! Your 350 rupees. Get lost! Get lost! Kainat.. Neither can your tears take away the world's problems, nor your worries. If you still wish to cry, then you may. I will not stop you! I had come home, tired, in this worry. Don't worry! I shall read your manuscript today itself. Yes! It was darkness until far away. Black and quite darkness. A tiny bulb, trembling, was begging the darkness for its light. On the other side there was closed door. There was the noise of the anklet coming from behind the door. As though it was telling me.. ..Kainat Mirza, if you really write stories.. ..then, have courage and peep into this closed door.. ..and see the misbehavior done with life. Who? Who is it, brother? Coming! Careful, the door will break! Careful! Careful! Okay! Come on! Who are you? Who are you? - Quite! My name is Raheem Shaikh! Have you ever heard, or not? No! - Then hear it today! I am Raheem Shaikh! Means, Raheem the goon. Listen! This girl will be in your house, whole night. You understood? This girl, in the house? - Quite! If you move your tongue, you'll not see the sun tomorrow. Heard? But, this... - I told you once. If you move your tongue, you'll be buried in this house. What? Right! Listen! I'll come and take her tomorrow morning. Got it? Bloody hell! What problem is this? Who was this man? That was not a man. He was Raheem Shaikh! A goon from 'Jhumma Bhatti'. And I am Sultana. Whoever you are, how can you stay in my house? Why didn't you tell this to Raheem Shaikh? Well! Decency is another name for weakness. I..I.. don't know what to do. Hey, you! I am talking to you. Up! Up! Actually, you are mistaken. Where is the misunderstanding happening? No one can fool constable Pandey. - No! Seeing this kerchief on your neck I knew 'What you are'. Tell your name. Dawood Mohammed Khan Yusuf Zaid. Very lengthy name. Dawood. Okay where do you stay? There, in that dwelling. Behind, there! - Okay! Come on, money! - I did not get the money sir. Not money. Profession. Work. What work do you do? Work? - Yes. Sir, I am a writer. I am a writer. - What? Why did you not tell first? Please sit! Sit! You are from my category. I am a fantastic writer too. - Really? But I don't know to write. The brain is full of stories and ideas. Just yesterday I got such an idea that, I got crazy about it. Let me tell you. Fade in. Draupati is bating in the pond. Why? You need to understand, partner. If Draupati does not bath in the pond.. ..from where will sex come from? Sex! - Oh! We took Draupati as a heroine because.. ..how will the censor people cut it if it's Draupati? So, Draupati is bating with 'Lux' soap. With 'Lux' soap? - Yes. Why? Because we shall take 50,000 rupees in the name of advertisement. Didn't get it? - Yes, yes. There's lots of ideas in this stories. So, Draupati comes out after bathing. After coming out, she ties up a flowery Sari' of brand 'Fille Mill'. Advertisement number 2. Fifty Thousand. - Yes. It's now 1 lakh. Isn't it? After that she wears a sandal, branded 'Dawood'. If we wish we can put some dialogues into Draupati's mouth. She smilingly tells her friend: Friend, I always wear 'Dawood' shoes. This can wear off, but cannot tear off. Cannot tear off. Are these Dawood people your relative? No! No! - Then it's fine! If they are your relatives, we won't get the money for the advertisement. Lese, we'll take off the 'Dawood' sandal and replace with 'Bata'. How will it matter to Draupati? The story. The story is in my hands. Control! - Go ahead! Ahead? Draupati wears the sandal. And, a girl brings 'Cherry Blossom' shoe polish. 'Cherry Blossom' shoe polish? Hey partner, advertisement number 4. Two lakhs, without story. - Free! These days there's more money in the advertisement than the subject. We have lots of advertisement in our subject, where's the story? Okay, partner, let's talk business now, Okay? Let's make a team. - Team? A pair? These days, it's the times of teams. Laxmikant-Pyarelal, Kalyanji-Anandji. Salim-Javed, Bappi Lahiri. Hold on! Bappi Lahiri is one person. Well, this is cheating. If I ever meet him, I will ask him... ..."you being a single person, how could you have double name?" This is wrong! - Okay! We'll see. Partner, our team name will be Dawood and Pandya. Dawood, Pandya. Shake hands! National integration. Even the sensor shall be happy. Come on! There... So we are done. Partner, your talent and my police brains shall make a name in the film industry. That's right! You think of the story, whole night. - Okay! I shall come tomorrow to Ameenabai's place. Okay? - Okay! You have to go to Ameenabai house. I have to go that way. Okay! I shall come tomorrow. Okay? - Okay! What a team! Dawood, Pandya. Dawood, Pandya. National integration. Wow! Dawood, Pandya. Great god! Listen! Listen! Look! It's morning, wake you! Listen! Listen! Oh god! You can't awaken a girl? No! No! - Who are you? I am nobody. Yesterday night, that... Raheem had come to leave you. Wake up! He'll be coming soon. I am going to the bathroom. And you please...Okay? Might be Raheem. Greetings, sister in law! I am constable Pandya, the partner of Dawood, the story man. We've formed a team. These days no one gets a job in the movies without a team. Yesterday night I had told my partner that I have a story in my brain. You might not know. There's a goon here who was caught yesterday night. Raheem, the goon. Got caught? - Yes. And I made a story on the same idea. Well! Where is brother Dawood? He's bathing. No problem! Let him get ready. I shall wait outside. No problem! Has Raheem come? No! It is some constable. Says, Rahim got caught in the night. What? Greetings, mother! - Be blessed, son. Okay, thanks! Are you here to meet Dawood? Yes, madam! I am Dawood's partner. We'll be forming a writer's team. Dawood-Pandya. Okay! Dawood knows that you've come, isn't it? I told sister in law. - Sister in law? Yes, Dawood's wife! His wife! Wife! What? - Inside! Dawood! Leave this marriage thing to me. One day I'll get you such a daughter in law, you'll be amazed. Did you see anyone? - I did see. But, haven't kept. Truly he had said, "you'll be amazed." Dawood! Yes, mother! - Son of as mother! You dare this? You had no shame? What could I do, mother? Lying to me? I did see. But, haven't kept. - Haven't kept, this. You brought my daughter in law, hiding, like this? Daughter in law? - What else? Oh no! Neither did someone do the tradition, nor anything else, no celebration. Have you no shame? - Let me tell you... Please understand me! The thing is that... What should I understand? You shall make me understand everything because I am younger to you. That's not so, mother! - Let me go! Move away! - What are you doing mother? Come here! Come here, look who has come. Listen! Listen! What's happened? What's happened? Have a look! Have a look! What a moon-like bride Dawood has brought! So the good news was about the moon-like bride? "Her hands are colored, someone please come and take the veil up." "Someone please come and take the veil up." "Her hands are colored, someone please come and take the veil up." "Someone please come and take the veil up." Mother, where are you taking? - You come on! See for yourself! Where are you taking, inside? - Be quite! May god give you'll a long married life. Today, you have fulfilled that wish... ...of mine which would have never got fulfilled. It was my desire to see my Wahid's daughter in law come in this room. I made and decorated this room with so much expectation. But when the marriage day neared.. ..without even telling me my Wahid passed away. Since then locked his room. Today, I've opened it after 12 years. Come! Do meet the expectations of this room! What's the need for all this, mother? There is need! This idiot Raheem was to be arrested today only? What trouble is this? It's a crooked job to be a bride. My neck is paining, bending all the time. You hang your neck on that chair and sleep on the bed. I shall sleep here! Forget sleeping, I shall not even touch this bed. Why? I'll be burned. Be burned? Mr. Dawood, this bed is for the marriage night, for a bride. I am not a bride. I am a courtesan! A courtesan? Now you might ask...even I ask... ..."how did I leave the court and reach this room?" Don't know if this room is the result of story. Or, past. But still, I surely know the end of this story. This is not some two or four years ago. It's many, many years ago. The moon was peeping through the door of my room. And I was dancing with a thousand anklet on my feet. "A precious devotee." "A precious devotee." "A precious devotee." "A precious devotee." "Coming to the market, losing the flowers, was sold off priceless." "A precious devotee." "A precious devotee." "Young age, plain mantlet, cruel dance." "Young age, plain mantlet, cruel dance." "There's scrambling in the town of beauty, everything is sold away." "You too bargain, my dear." "You too bargain, my dear." "You too bargain, my dear." "You too bargain, my dear." "Coming to the market, losing the flowers, was sold off priceless." "A precious devotee." "A precious devotee." "Wearing the flowers, the hands coloured, was seated all dressed up." "Wearing the flowers, the hands coloured, was seated all dressed up." "I am not wedded this night, yet I am wedded." "You too say something, dear." "You too say something, dear." "You too say something, dear." "You too say something, dear." "Coming to the market, losing the flowers, was sold off priceless." "A precious devotee." "A precious devotee." "A precious devotee." "A precious devotee." "A precious devotee." "A precious devotee." Fantastic! Fantastic! Very nice! Very nice! Madam, that was fantastic! Fantastic! Fantastic! Fantastic! Fantastic! Do have your say, Rahim! Madam Bilkis, what's there to say? My face has become colourless. What a girl you've readied! Talk about the matter! - What matter? I had given you 2000 before, here is another 2000. The remaining 6000 later! What the hell! Away with this 2000 rupees! In this ten years, the price of ladyfinger has risen from 75 paisa to 7 rupees. And my Sultana's rates remain the same? Even her nails won't come for 10,000. Spending time is a far away thing. You are cheating, Bilkis madam! It's cruelty! If you say, I shall give you back the 2000 also. Sultana is worth 50,000 now. If you want you take 1 lakh, but take this 2000 now. Come on take! Let the girl reach Bombay just once. Then you see, this girl will become a printing press for money. I was sold off to Rahim. And he brought me to Bombay to do business with my body. And my virginity was traded. Sir, the police! But before the auction was complete, There was a police raid. There was total chaos. Rahim took me from the back stairs and ran away. And I came out of my story to be in your story. Hope you've got the answer to your question. As to how this courtesan reached this room. In which, Ameena madams affection is spread like the mats for Namaz (prayer). But, now answer this question! How did I get shut behind this door with a courtesan? Coincidence, bad luck, whatever you may say. But I will have to face this Coincidence, bad luck even after you go. What will I tell people? Say that there was a telegram. I had to go to my house. - Then? Then say that she was unable to bear the happiness of marriage. She died! Are you ready? - Yes. Before the neighbours wake up, we should reach the station. So that we can inquire about your transportation. Keep this! - What's this? Got it yesterday at the ceremony. You got it, so you keep it. Why give me? We are not fortunate to have these ceremonies, sir. This got it for your bride. Keep it! When your bride comes, give it on my behalf. No! You keep it! Will come useful during journey. - Thank you! Listen! - Yes. Not from here. We'll go from backdoor. If someone sees us... Thank you for your generosity! What generosity? First time I know that, there are humans too in this world. Else, a courtesan is just a doll for a night. Greetings Dawood sir! Trying to sneak away silently or what? Who are you'll? Rahim has sent us. - Okay! Okay! Take her, surely! - No! Rahim has said that the girl will stay here only. Stay here only? - Yes! Why will she stay here? Are you out of your mind or what? Nobody questions Rahim, here, in Bombay. Understood? That's okay! - Once said is said! Till the time Rahim does not come out of the jail, Sultana will stay here. Here is the trunk. And your keys. Good bye! This...this... - Listen! Seen this knife? If you try to escape, you're finished. You too listen to this man! Now this girl is your life. If she's not there, you too are not there. Understood? Did you hear this, Dawood? Dawood is lost in deep thoughts, Mr. Lala. You better tell us! Ladies, this is for men. Yes, listen! The police raided Babu Kantidas... ... house in Bandra east and found out his four wives. Forget it, Mr. Lala! Can four wives be found in the house of a Hindu? That's right! When the police asked this, he said his real name was Abdul Rashid Farooqi. Okay! - Kantidas is a filmy name. - Oh! Later it was known that it was not his wives at all. Then? - They were courtesans. This person was running a business in his house. Courtesans at home? Oh god! What's the matter man? You are scared as if your secret has been opened. What's the matter, Brother Dawood? Seem very disturbed. Are you keeping fine? - Yes. Yes. Latif, where is Mr. Dawood? There he comes! Hey Dawood! Dawood! - Yes sir. Did you read the manuscript of Kainat Mirza? I've read a little, some of it is remaining. How is the start? It's got a cyclonic start. Then it should have a good end too. - I think so. Do read it soon, please! - Yes sir. Well! What is the Title of the novel? 'Tawaif'. Sister in law, open the door! Was shouting since long. What was our sister in law doing? Was doing prayers. - Wow! You'll learn something. You'll too start doing prayers. Greetings! - be blessed! Do you read 5 times? Well, I do read. Oh god! Saw that? What's happening? Greetings! - Be blessed! Do you know, our bride prays 5 times? Fantastic! I wish our daughter too was like you. Nadira is, by god's grace, so sweet. Sister in law, come for meal, please! Will he not come for the meal? He'll eat the thorns. Go! Come on! Come on! - Take her. The meal is getting cold. Saw that sister? Such a nice bride in these times. Dawood is a lucky person. Should I tell Kainat about Sultana? She might find a solution. No! The matter might get out of hands too. Possible that Kainat might misunderstand. What's the matter? You are very silent. No! Nothing as such. Then, do talk something. What to talk? Something that happened today, something that happened yesterday. Take! - Thank you! Kainat, some problems in life cannot be shared. Example? You take the example of my life. Such a thing has happened which I can neither tell you... ...nor can I get out from it. - Then? What then? Up to god! Can I help? Yes. Just keep smiling like this! Will the problems be over with it? At least I can forget it for some time. Will you'll keep talking only or have food also? This can get cold too. Come on sit! This is the problem about you educated people. You'll talk a lot. This my girl is very boring. - Mother! Come on, eat, son! Okay, then good bye! God is always there! If you don't wish to tell your problems then don't tell! But keep this holy necklace with you! BY god's grace your problems will be solved. Take it! Dawood's alarm has gone off, to sleep, and he has not yet come. I'm very hungry! Good thing that you are eating! Mother, I was testing the salt. I tell you, "you have your meal." How can I eat without him? He hasn't yet come. Isn't it? Let him come, I'll show him. He's not bothered about the daughter in law. Listen to Ameena madam and have the meal. Come on, eat your meal! Oh no! The same problem, again. God save me! Please come, Mr. Dawood! Come! Food is ready! You eat! I've already eaten. If I were your real wife, I'd break your head. Because I'm a courtesan, I'm being modest. With whom did you have your meal with? Is there any girl or what? Since you are late, there should be a girl. What say? Isn't it? Okay! Leave this dress! Do eat something from my hand. Strange! Where are you going? You change your dress, I'll go for a walk and come. There is no need for the husband to... ...go out when the wife is changing her dress. Sometimes she, herself, undresses him. Please don't talk to me like this! Come on man! I am making you practice being a husband, for free. You are very naughty! You are very naughty! Listen Mr. Dawood Khan Yusuf Zaid! Neither have you called me here... ...nor have I come here, by myself. Both are here because of the fear of Rahim. Destiny is to be blamed. Why should we both fight? This moment can be spent laughing too. For god's sake, don't trouble me! Please, for god's sake! Now go to the bathroom and change the dress! Come on, go there, now! - Going! God, where have you put me, with this problem? Why this theatre partition? Are you doing some drama or what? You won't understand this. I am dividing this room into 2 parts with this curtain. You shall be sleeping on this side of the curtain. And I shall be sleeping on the other side. Understood? Really foolish! - Why? People go to a courtesan leaving their house, family etc. Look at you! The courtesan has come to your house and you are showing your decency. Look! Listen to me and go sleep on that cot! Neither am I habituated of sleeping alone, and neither education. I am not able to sleep! As it is I won't be able to sleep! You have taken away the peace from this house. Go away! I have put life into this. Else, what was there in your life? Ameenabai? At the most, Nadira. Talking! Look! Sultana, there's a limit to misbehaviour. A forceful guest. Add to that, arrogance? I haven't yet got forceful, dear. Oh god, where have got stuck up? Really, a very ill-mannered girl. No shame. Doesn't care for anything. There is a limit to misbehaviour. Stupid! What do I do? God, what do I do? Who, Rahim? Not getting sleep, isn't it? How will I get sleep when you are here? Yes, how will? The youthfulness is creating havoc from within. For god's sake, please go away from here! God! What are you thinking? I am thinking, "how many years of... ...punishment will I get if I murder someone?" Lies! You are thinking of that girl with whom you had dinner. Lie down and think. Good night! Give me the eggs please! Mr. Dawood! Mr. Dawood! - Yes. Here's the tea! I was dreaming about you. Is it? - Oh no! Come on, wake up! Have your tea. Look! Don't touch me. Okay? So, I should touch. But not like this. So, here's the lovely touch. - Oh god! That's mother! It can't be anyone other than mother. She's right on time, sharp at 7.30 am, like a clock. Get up! Go, open the door! This pillow. Greetings, mother! Greetings, mother! Be blessed! Be blessed! Did you'll fight amongst yourselves? No, mother! There was extra sugar in the tea. He was angry at me, and took out on this cup. What is this, boy? Even if you roam about with the sun on your head... ...you'll not find a girl like her. Poor girl has come to Bombay for the first time. You can't even take her out. And add to that you are breaking the cups? Today is a holiday. Go, take her out! Go! - He will not take me out, mother. Why will he not take? - What's there to see, in Bombay? 'Chor Bazaar', Gambling, and what else than this? Is it? Then give me the rent for 6 months. And, the 217 rupees credits. What? - Yes, give it now! Okay, I'll take her! Don't ask for the credit that you had given me. Listen! Oh no! Are we here sightseeing or a 'Kabaddi' match? For god's sake be away! Away! - Why be away? What if someone sees? The entire Bombay has come out to see you only. - Mr. Dawood! Oh no! - What happened? The boss, from our 'Kitab Ghar'. For god's sake, keep mind your language, talk respectfully. Okay? Greetings! Greetings! Greetings! So, how's the walk? Greetings! - Just like that. You didn't tell me who this is. Nigam sir, the thing is... Actually... I understood that you have hid the fact from me that you are a husband too. And I understood the meaning too. You are a miser, don't want to spend on reception. Right? No! No! - That's why you didn't tell. Daughter, what's your name? - Sultana! Be blessed, daughter! He is a miser. Won't you keep a reception? The reception shall be as and when you come. What say? - Yes! Yes why not? Be blessed, daughter! I should be giving the reception. You are my daughter in law. I was just joking! Mr. Dawood! - Yes, sir! Yes sir! Congratulation! I liked your wife very much. She's beautiful and also well mannered. I was...there! Our group has arrived too. These are my 4 daughters. Tina, Meena, Cheena and Beena. And these are her friends. And, son, these are the friends of her friends. We are here for a picnic. You too come with us! No! Sir, we shall leave. - What no? My wife is coming. - Listen, wife! I'll give you a good news. Come here! Come fast! - What's it? Greetings! Dawood has got married. Problem? Told you so many times not to eat grams. But do you listen? You will have problems, of course. - Yes, yes. Mother, not problem but its 'Marriage'. Marriage? - Okay! Do get married! Climb the horse. The children shall clap from behind you. Daughter, tell your mother that a... ...bride does not climb on a horse but a mare. Father is not talking about his marriage but... - why are you shouting? Am I deaf? - Who said so? Who said? Dawood! - Yes. Who is with you? That's what I was saying, it's his wife. Give them blessings, go! Why didn't you tell before? My mistake! Be blessed, daughter. May 'Allah' give you a son. Why can't God give, why only 'Allah'? The thing is that, Dawood, after marriage she.... ...prayed to God for a son. But all the 4 times, only daughters were born. So she is annoyed with god. And praying to 'Allah'. Now it will neither be a son nor a daughter. Come on, daughter! You come with me. No! No! Sister in law will come with us. I was saying that... You sit! Be seated! - You also come! Come! Come! Be seated son! - Be seated! "We come during the winter." "We come during the winter." "Whom do you come to take during winter." "We come to take her during winter." "Whom will you send to take during winter." "We'll send him to take during winter." "Look, my husband is seated shy, with his gaze down." "Look, my husband is seated shy, with his gaze down." "Want to say something but cannot open his mouth." "Look, my husband is seated shy, with his gaze down." "My wife, very cunning, is making me dance whole day after fooling me." "Oh god." "My wife, very cunning, is making me dance whole day after fooling me." "This is an unnecessary problem hanging around my neck, god save me." "My wife, very cunning, is making me dance whole day after fooling me." "One day when I was tired, sleeping in the night." "I was lost in some sweet dream." "When there was knock, I thought it was some guest." "I never knew that it was death coming." "As I opened the door, it was this innocent face." "Seeing the house empty she became my wife forcefully." "What kind of destiny is this? Someone please save me." "My wife, very cunning, is making me dance whole day after fooling me." "Look, my husband is seated shy, with his gaze down." "Yours was an empty house, I made it a home." "I became your wife, made you a human being." "I bore all your naggings yet my lips never complained." "Like a well-wisher who has no salary." "All your problems will be solved by me." "You shall have a name in this world because of me." "I love him but he scolds me, he's got no shame." "Look, my husband is seated shy, with his gaze down." "My wife, very cunning, is making me dance whole day after fooling me." "This is an unnecessary problem hanging around my neck, god save me." "Oh wife, my husband.' "Oh wife, my husband.' How was my acting? Good? To hell with your acting. I don't know what's going to happen to me. The matter is increasing, and my troubles too are increasing. The more I try to come out of it.. ...the more I am getting stuck in it. I only know that I don't wish to put you in trouble. It's all a game of destiny. Whose destiny? Mine or yours? Might be of both. But one day I will have to go away. Even if you go away, my problems will not ease. Who all will I explain that you are not part of my life? You are an incident of my life. I've become an incident in your life. But will never become an unfortunate thing. I'm a courtesan. I'm not an ungrateful one. I'll sleep on the mat today. Doesn't feel good. Whoever you are, you are a guest in this house. Constable? - Greetings! Brother Dawood! - The morning paper. Brother Dawood! Brother Dawood! Greetings, sister in law! - Greetings! Sister in law, why hand this bed sheet? Brother Pandya. - Yes. We thought this part should be the bedroom. - Okay! And that part, the drawing room. Made the house into a 1 bedroom, hall flat. You crack nice jokes. So, let me have a hot cup of tea. Hey, partner! - Welcome Pandya! Thought of visiting my partner since I was passing by. Brother Dawood, hope you haven't forgotten our partnership thing. No! I'm no duty! Remember, I had told you about the goon Rahim? On that, I've got an idea. There was a girl with him, that night. That girl went missing like magic. Sister in law, if I find that girl. Brother Dawood's days shall shine. Brother Dawood, remember one thing. We shall not take anything less than 5.25 lakhs for this story. Dawood-Pandya, Salim-Javed, Kalyanji-Anandji. Mr. Pandey! - Yes. I am in a hurry. Need to go to office. - Okay! We shall sit and discuss this story some other time. Okay! I too shall leave for my work. - Okay! Go! Mr. Dawood! - take it to Mr. Lalaji! Yes, sir. I read your note on Kainat Mirza's novel. You have appreciated it so much, we have to publish the novel. Truly? - Yes. Thank you very much, Mr. Suleiman! Why are you saying Thank you? Mr. Suleiman, you don't know how much of help you are being to Kainat... ...by publishing the novel. Brother, troubles are meant to be solved. It will be done away with. You do one thing. - Yes sir. Tell the printing department to start the books for the Novel. Very nice, sir! Here is the print order! - Okay sir! Brother Ahmed! Has Gulshan Nanda's novel come? I'll go and give her the news now. Hearing this good news she'll go mad, Mr. Dawood. Really, mad. Greetings! - Who is it, daughter? Mother, its Mr. Suleiman, the general manager from 'Kitab Ghar'. Why are you out? Come inside! Come! - Thank you! Since I was passing by, I thought I'll give you the good news. 'Kitab Ghar' has decided to publish your novel. Really? - Thank god, a million times. Please accept this grant on behalf of 'Kitab Ghar'. Please take! As an advance! Three Thousand rupees? Such big advance? Thank you very much Mr. Suleiman! Daughter, do think of it as: the dry plants getting water. Please be seated! I shall get you tea! Happy? Come! - Oh god! Please be seated with manners. The people outside... What trouble is this? Did you have a fight with someone? Who is this Kainat Mirza? - Why? She's a new writer. That same girl? Is she very beautiful? Yes, she is. More than me? There can be no competition between a house lamp, and... ... the lamp in the markets. Okay! I am the lamp in the markets. But, yet I burn like a lamp. Do you love Kainat? Don't know! I might be. Does she love you? Don't know this too. I think she might be. This love of "might be" is not right. If you have loved, do express it too. Hope someone else doesn't take it away. And you standing holding the heart. This is the front cower of your novel, 'Band Darwaza'. This is beautiful! Is it? - Yes. We need a color photograph for the back cover. My photograph? - Yes. Do send it fast! Dawood. - Yes sir. Good I met you. Wife has made it so difficult. Daughters are always talking about Sultana. Come to my place one day. Tell me, yes or no! Sir! Sir! She is Kainat Mirza. We are publishing her book 'Band Darwaza'. This Mr. Nigam sir, the owner of this 'Kitab Ghar'. Greetings! - Greetings! Glad to see you! Thank you. Mr. Suleiman was appreciating you so much. That's his greatness! Tomorrow night's meal is at our place. Okay? And, listen! Not alone. Do get her also along. Okay? - Yes, sir! Yes. Wow! So many receptions happening these days. Who are you taking along? Mr. Nigam was just...was just... Then take me along! Okay! You come along! Come along! I am joking! Why you got so scared? Am I scared? - Yes. Where am I scared? Why should I be scared? My face is such. Did you call for me? - Yes, Lala! Be seated! Wanted an advice from you. Tell me! I wish Dawood's salary be increased. Suleiman too was appreciating him. The boy is very nice. He's worth. He's M.A pass. He should make progress. Increase his salary by 300 rupees! Your orders! I shall go and give him the good news. Listen, Lala! Lala, have you met his wife? Is he married? Even I did not know. But, what a girl. Very nice from all aspects. What we say? Fantastic! Seeing here, I thought that Dawood's salary is less. Okay sir! Hello, Usman! - Yes. Come here! Fatima, Radheshyam, Dawood, you also come here! All of you come here! Congratulate Dawood, please! - Mr. Lala! - About what? This man is so smart. It's height of dishonesty. He got married and did not let anyone know of it. What is this? We want a party! No dinner night. We want a reception! Yes, yes. We want! - Okay! Okay! I am in such a hurry that I'm not yet in my sense. We don't know. We want party. We don't know. We want party. There's no escaping this. Wait! Wait! Wait! There's one more good news. - What's that? Mr. Nigam has increased his salary by 300 rupees a month. Wow! Congratulations! Increased by 300 rupees a month. The bride is so lucky, isn't it? Congratulations! There should be a party now! Yes. Oh god! What happened? My head! Dawood will be beaten so bad that he'll come to his senses. What did you do? I didn't do. It's you. It's you! - Where's the water? People in the office got to know about our marriage, you know? No water here! - Then what happened? They want a party, and wish to come here for the meal. Let me drink water first. So, this is it? You got me scared. Let them come, if they want to. I say, do call Nigam sir and his family too. So that we'll finish it once for all. Yes, you call the entire city. You can even call your goon Rahim, so that it's done, once for all. Okay? Talking! How will we accommodate so many people? Do you know how much money will be spent in feeding all of them? Yes, I know everything! What you know? You know nothing. - Saying "I know everything." God is great! Everything will be fine! You call for the party! Yes! Mr. Dawood! - Yes, sir! When are you inviting for the party? I feel, Saturday night will be fine. I am more interested in meeting your wife, than the party. Mr. Nigam was so full of praises! Just a minute! Come here! - Yes. He has given this money as advance for you. How did I land up in his wrong room? Outside... - Come inside Mr. This is your room! How did you do all this? It's a magic! Those people think I'm your wife. If I don't serve well, they'll feel you've ruined your destiny. Got such a wife who has not even arranged for water at home. Where did you get so much money from? I had that money gotten from the ceremony. The other, I had that diamond ring. It was not used at your house. I sold it. What if Rahim asks' you about it? Did that belong to his father that he should ask me? If he wants he can get a new one made. Sultana, what you did is not right. At least you should have asked me. I did so many things without asking you. I came in this house without a asking you. I dream without asking you. That, I am really your wife. Don't assume that a courtesan cannot love. A courtesan can love. But she can neither express it. Nor she can make believe it. What do I answer you? Don't tell anything. Just keep listening. I forgot. I had to put this picture. This wall is such an old time wall. Careful! What are you doing? You'll get hurt. What is this? Nothing! It's a 'Sari' (dress). Brought it for you. For me? Yes, got an increment at office for 300 rupees. Since this increment is because of you.. ..I should get something for you. - Okay! Paying me back? You cruel! You could have lied that, it's a gift of love. I'd have given my life for it. Well! This is the most beautiful moment for me. And this, most precious gift! Wear it on me with your hands! If not you then I'll embrace your 'Sari'. Look Sultana! Please behave well, and with mannerisms. Hope it does not put me in trouble. What's the time? They haven't yet come. Strange! What could have happened? They've come! They've come! Behave well, please! We've come! - Welcome Mr. Hafiz! Greetings! Greetings! Greetings! - Greetings! - Greetings! Fantastic! May god keep this pair united! Good house! Greetings! - Greetings! Greetings! Greetings! Take, sister in law! Made it good! Listen! - Mr. Dawood! Dawood! - Nigam sir. Welcome, Nigam sir! - Be blessed, daughter! This ring! Daughter, always wear it! - Okay! Good! Made a great house of this one room. - Yes, sir. Come! Mr. Hafiz, shall I sit with you? Not allergic to cold, I hope. Welcome Mr. Lala! Greetings! Greetings! - Be blessed! Be blessed! Take this, daughter! You people made this reception into a business. Absolutely! - Can't come empty handed, either. Could have just blessed. It would have been enough. May God keep you happy! Seen that, Lala? This is called mannerism. It's only found in family circles. Welcome, Bai Amma! (mother). Come! This is our Bai Amma! (mother). Greetings! - Greetings! This is Mr. Nigam! Your son's boss. Please take! - Thanks! You too take! - Mother, He's Lala Fakirchand! Greetings! - Greetings! Come, the food is ready too. - Okay! Please come! Get up! Get up! - Lala, Tell me, what's this? 'Ruhafza'. This is not good for people having cold. You stop taking Ice. Son you take it! - The food is served for you. Please come, Nigam sir! Come! - Please come! Brought that cousin? Get it, keep it here! - Come! Oh great! - Come! Cooked so many things! It's a reception on behalf of the entire neighborhood. Everyone has got something or the other. Fantastic! - Nigam sir. - Heard that, Lala? Saw what a bride has done? - I am seeing that. Yes, yes, doing! Is this rice? - The rice has meat, isn't it? You have 'Mater Pulav'. (rice-peas) You are going thin. Eat more! I'll eat this only. Nothing will happen. I'll take out the meat. Enough! Enough! Mr. Lala, do have cigarettes. - Cigarettes? Yes! Take this! You gave her Ice cream? Bad! He's got cold! - Be quite! Food was great! Stomach is full. We need to have music now, for digestion. Food? You just ate that. How much more you'll eat? Not food, but music. Oh music? - Yes, Sultana sings! Sing a song, daughter. Yes, please! Please sing. "Today's evening in your name." "Today's evening in your name." "In this gathering, my love salutes everyone." "Today's evening in your name." "Today's evening in your name." "This scene, this atmosphere, this love, this sincerity." "Life has jumped up, love has found love." "Let the times not be annoyed, let this love never break off." "Even if life is a dream, let the dream never break." "Let Love never be stained." "Today's evening in your name." "Today's evening in your name." "Let the heart rule, let the fun prosper" "Let this evening be remembered till morning." 'Let the era go on, let the time pass by." "If the heart is excited, let it be excited." "Dance and make merry, whatever be the consequences." "Today's evening in your name." "Today's evening in your name." "In this gathering, my love salutes everyone." "Today's evening in your name." "Today's evening in your name." "Today's evening in your name." Take, minced meat and bread! You like it a lot, isn't it? Thank god, Rahim went away quietly! Else it would have been chaos. I'd not have been able to show my face to anyone. What's to be done now? Seems like it's time for me to go. Look at the cruelty of circumstances! People think you are my wife. Neither can I tell you to go away, and neither to wait. I understand your problems. Don't worry! Leave everything to me. You go to office now! Listen! Your betel! Smile and go! No, Sultana! No! You cannot stay there, you will have to come here. Are you some great, to leave me or call me whenever you wish to? Is Dawood your servant? No smartness, okay? My name is Rahim Shaikh! Stop the nonsense! I'll break your face. Remember that. Won't came. Her father's rule prevails. Come on, make a glass! Listen, Rahim Shaikh! Dawood is a decent man. He helped us in our bad times. Will it look good if I suddenly come here? People will ask: Where's the wife gone? What will that poor guy answer then? Come here! Are you in some relation with him? Don't touch me! I am not your prostitute now. I am Dawood's wife. You are talking as if you are really Dawood's wife. Away! Even if I am not his real wife, I am surely Dawood's wife, for the world. I cannot just go away and dirty his house. Rahim Shaikh, Dawood hasn't touched your Sultana. You too don't touch his dignity. To hell with his dignity. What about my business? Will you ruin him for all the favors he has done? I cannot leave you with him, whole life, to pay back his favors. Understand? When did I say this? - What else did you mean? If I suddenly come, there shall be many eyebrows raised in the neighborhood. There'll be questions asked. By all this he shall be defamed. Rahim Shaikh, I became a wife from a courtesan. You should give me some time to become a courtesan from a wife. What do you mean? I mean, in few days I shall make some excuse and come by myself. So that he's not stained. Without any noise, your Sultana will come back to you. Okay, agreed! Do remember one thing. If you play smart with me, my name is Rahim Shaikh. It doesn't take much time for Rahim Shaikh's... ... hands to reach this neck. Okay? Okay, bye! Listen! You look stunning in this dress. Don't touch this dress. I've carried along Dawood's respect in this dress. Hell with you! Respect. Listen! - What? Till I don't come here on my own, don't come to call me. - Okay! I shall come by myself. Listen! Give my salute to that Dawood. Fantastic! She did like this. The man seems to be a respected person. These days, the prices have risen so high. Greetings Sultana sister! - Greetings Sultana! Greetings! Leave me! What if mother comes? Mother has gone to the market with Ameena Bai. Sister in law! Where's aunty? - Gone to the market. Come with me! It's a new book. Display it. We'll see, then. - Okay! We are trying to, Mr. Lala. Dawood, you gave a nice reception but missed me. Not that, sir. You had gone to Delhi. Mr. Lala put the whole thing on me, what could I do? Everyone applauds your wife, a lot. Do introduce me also sometimes. Yes, sir. Whenever you say. Mr. Hafiz! - Yes. Put these new books on the shelf. And yes. Kainat's novel 'Band Darwaza' has been published. Really? - Look here! Stop here, driver! Take it back! Come! Please come, be seated. I am not here to be seated today. I've come to give something. What? On behalf of 'Kitab Ghar', I would like... ...to take the pride of presenting the first copy of your novel, 'Band Darwaza'. My book? My book has been published? My book has been published? Is it really my book? Thank you very much Mr. Suleiman! I am sorry! Mother! Mother! What happened? What happened? Mr. Suleiman, why is she crying? These are ears of happiness. He novel has been published. Really? - Yes. - Yes. Mother! You did not go? I had gone, but came back. - Why? You were troubled because I had come here. I wish that there be no trouble to you after I leave. I shall, myself, go away after 2 to 4 days. So that you don't fall in trouble. 'Band Darwaza'. (The closed Door). Kainat Mirza. Very beautiful! With love to this universe. Thinking if God's universe is more beautiful, or mine. Good! Why didn't you give her the novel? I got late. Mr. Suleiman gave it first. Beware! Hope Mr. Suleiman is not first in doing other things too. What can I do even if does it? Afraid of him winning? Mr. Suleiman can never win against me. Yes, I can surely be defeated by him. If I say anything more than thanking Mr. Suleiman and Mr. Nigam, I shall cry. This would be my first experience to cry in happiness. Kainat, how was the celebration? - Very good. How do I thank you? Thank Mr. Dawood if you wish to. Because, all whatever happened is because of him. Mr. Suleiman please come here! I'll be back! Should I say thank you? - Please do! Thank you very much! Mr. Suleiman, good party and a good girl too. Mr. Suleiman please give us also a photograph with Kainat Mirza. Sure! Sure! First copy of the second edition of my book. Please look! For Dawood, without whom my journey would be incomplete. With Love. Yours, Kainat. Thank you! Thank you for your book! Thank you for your Love! Thank you for your greetings too. Before this greeting turns into goodbye. Let's go away from here. Okay! - Come on! You have taken a promise not to come to our house. I shall abduct and take you. Surely, take away! Mr. Dawood! - Sir! Are you going? Sir, I shall leave her and come. Take her in my car. The driver too is down. - Okay! Bye! - Bye! Bye! Just stop here! Listen! I want to tell you something. Don't tell. Because I've heard what you want to tell. Listen. Mr. Shakur, what's the chaos? - Dawood, Nadira has run away. Yes, it seems she ran away with the dance master. Very unfortunate happening. Very unfortunate happening. Father is a devotee and the daughter is doing like this? Shame! Sister. - Yes. Where is Bai Amma (mother)? - She is in the house of Umar sir. Excuse me. Uncle! Bai Amma (mother)! Dawood, you know, Nadira ran away. Yes, that... - No whereabouts about her since evening. We've got ruined, son. Never knew that teaching dance would be so costly. Where is Sultana? - She too is not to be seen since long. Did Sultana show her true colours? She might have, possibly, abducted Nadira. Come! You sit here. I shall be back. - Where are you going? Don't we need a priest to conduct prayers? Okay! Close the door from inside. Sister in law! If you wanted to become a courtesan. You should have been born in a courtesan's house. Okay, Tabban! Here is 5000 rupees. The remaining, after seeing the girl. Where's the girl? - Come with me! - Come! The door is open. Where's the girl? Tell! Nadira has come! Nadira has come! Nadira has come! Nadira has come! Nadira has come! She's with Sultana! You idiot! I'll mannered! Shameless! Came back after spoiling your respect? - Get inside! Your daughter has come after blackening her face. Go to hell, you idiot! Look at your face... - What are you doing? What are you doing? Don't beat. Will you kill her or what? Move! Come here! Nadira, didn't you tell aunty that you are going with me? Didn't you tell? No! That's so wrong. Aunty I am sorry! But it was my last day of visit to the 'Garib Nawaz'. Her brother was going to come late, so I took her along with me. There! Hear that! What foolishness is this? Come with me! And you thought something else. You beat her so badly. What's the use crying now, Nadira? You should be ashamed. You did this to such a loving and trusting parents. What face would they show to the world? What would they say? That their good daughter ran away with someone? Forgive me, sister in law! Forgive me! Just imagine, if I had not followed you while... ...you were going with that dance master, do you know... ...what would have been your fate? You would have been auctioned 3 times so far. You would have been behind the closed doors of... ...some madam's customer, and the beds there would be... ...smelling of other customer's crime. Then, you would become part of that odour. You manner less girl, you played with my respect. Leave her, I said! Leave her! No house shouting now. Will you gather the neighbours now? Thank god that Nadira is back safe. I suggest: Find a good boy and get Nadira married. - Yes. Nothing has damaged yet. Nadira has learned a lesson too. Come! Come on, will you? Don't beat her now! Please forgive me! - For what? For having thought so many things about you, all this while. I am not worth someone's thought. It's a favour that you thought of me. Listen! I almost forgot. Here is your royalty cheque of 5000 rupees. Thank you very much, Mr. Suleiman. I won't be able to repay your kindness. At least I can. I shall ask it myself. As you wish. Greetings! Oh! Mr. Anif! You see it. - I'll find it out. What are you doing so early in the morning? Mr. Suleiman had called. I had to sign the agreement. He has also given the royalty cheque of 5000 rupees. Mr. Suleiman is being very favourable to you. All because of you. You've come like an angel in my life. So much of applause is not good. A person gets spoiled. Here is your cheque. Okay, I'll leave. We'll meet in the evening. Mr. Suleiman has called for you. Mr. Dawood, I had some work with you. Yes. You had brought Kainat's novel 'Band Darwaza' to me, isn't it? Yes. You will have to open this closed door for me. I did not get you. Mr. Dawood, the thing is that.. I'm in love with Kainat. If I take the message to her, myself.. ..she might think that I am asking for repayment of favours. If you accept this responsibility.. ..I shall be thankful to you. Now my love is in your hands, Mr. Dawood. If you wish, things can happen. "In the hope of your love." "Under the shade of the sadness of life." "The winds are blowing strong." "Hope the lamp is not put off." "In the hope of your love." "Under the shade of the sadness of life." "The winds are blowing strong." "Hope the lamp is not put off." "In the hope of your love." "Under the shade of the sadness of life." "Ours is a strange story." "Ours is a strange story." "Sometimes you were unable to understand." "Sometimes I could not tell it." "In the hope of your love." "Under the shade of the sadness of life." "The winds are blowing strong." "Hope the lamp is not put off." "In the hope of your love." "Under the shade of the sadness of life." "Neither can I afford a boat nor can I see the shores." "Neither can I afford a boat nor can I see the shores." "Hope the boat of my heart is not drowned in the waves." "In the hope of your love." "Under the shade of the sadness of life." "The winds are blowing strong." "Hope the lamp is not put off." "In the hope of your love." "Under the shade of the sadness of life." Who am I? - Hi Kainat! What happened? Have some annoyance? My destiny is annoyed with me. God forbid. Kainat, our love is about to die. Why? Listen, Kainat. The general manager of 'Kitab Ghar' wants to marry you. What are you saying? Right said. And that responsibility of getting the message to you is given to me. I have sold my novel through 'Kitab Ghar', but not my life and Love. You are not getting me, Kainat. Mr. Suleiman is my boss! My officer! Because of him your novel got published. My job and your life, both, are in his hands. We both are at stake. What is at stake, we'll see that. But you tell him "I am not interested in this proposal." If he asks "why"? Then tell him I like someone else. If he asks "who"? Then tell your name. Kainat, Love alone is not life. The distance between desire and having it is also called life. I also do love. But the reality of life also cannot be forgotten. The house rent, electricity bill.. ..ration card, bus ticket, this is what life is. Bus ticket, electricity bill, house rent, ration card, these are all there. But I don't wish to get married to electricity bill and ration card. If these are the names for a husband, and life.. then, neither do I want a husband nor a life. Dawood is right. Life will not go on with love alone. By god's grace, Suleiman has a nice house, a good job.. ..a new car, a good salary. What else do you want? Mother, I told you, I don't want to marry a house, car and salary. I want to marry a man. Dawood is the first and last man in my life. I shall only get married to him only. Whose marriage is being discussed? Hers, and whose? Don't know what's gone into her head. Says, she'll only get married to Dawood. Dawood is a good man. Will he do a second marriage? Second marriage? - What? I know about one wife, at least. You are lying. Kainat, I am not fond of lying. Nor it is a habit. You may ask the people in the office. Ask Nigam sir. If you still don't believe, ask Dawood. You are Kainat Mirza, isn't it? Please come! So you are Mrs. Dawood? This was not my destiny. I am only Sultana. I am not interested in your name. Not in me too? - No! Then what you want? I just came to tell Dawood that, It was the most unfortunate moment in my life when I had met him. And I can only say that.. You are not trying to understand whatever you are seeing. Isn't it enough to understand that, the... ...one who I loved has deceived me? If you have learned to love.. ..learn to express it too. Whatever the eyes see, may not be true always. God promise, I am not his wife. People like us are not born to be anyone's wife. Neither am I his "keep." You can say that I am one dirty book which Dawood has... ...kept it with him like a Quran. Please believe me, Kainat sister. I have seen may humans.. But I've seen only one Angel. Dawood. Someone who keeps smiling despite having lost a winning battle. This personality has made this small house as holy as a mosque. The atmosphere of which has changed a courtesan into a woman. I didn't understand. I'll explain. I am a courtesan. I am the reality of the character you spoke about in... ...your novel 'Band Darwaza'. You are here? At this hour? What are you doing? Just felt like worshipping you. Worship? - Yes. I am here after meeting Sultana. Met Sultana? Greetings. Kainat is not at home. I know that. I had come to meet you madam. Me? - Can I come inside? Yes, please come! Please be seated! Thank you! Tell me! I have come with Dawood's proposal for your daughter. Why should I send my daughter to be second wife? She's come with a proposal. Who are you, to him? - No one. Then how come you have brought the proposal? Has he divorced his first wife? Dawood is unmarried, madam. Who is the one living with him? That's me. The people in the neighbourhood and at 'Kitab Ghar' think of me as his wife. But I am not his wife. - Then who are you? I am just the result of his cruel condition, madam. AI am an incident! I am the abuse that he gets, I am a curse. Save Kainat and Dawood's life from being ruined madam! They love each other very much. But how can this be possible? Because you are there! I promise you that I shall go away from their lives in 24 hours. Give me Kainat, madam! Where did you go? - Nowhere! Did you meet Kainat? I had the desire to meet her. That too has been fulfilled today. Dawood, your Kainat is indeed more beautiful than god's universe. Kainat too was appreciating you. Tell me, Dawood.. .."will you remember me if I go away?" Sultana, you are not something that can be forgotten. You are a part of my good or bad life. Only after I met you did I know that there is an idol in every stone. It's not an abuse to be a courtesan. It's a compulsion. Despite being a courtesan, there is a woman in you. She is pure. Just like God's name. Enough Dawood! Else I shall start crying. Come, I've set the breakfast. Why did you prepared so many dishes? You praised me so much yesterday, So I thought of sweetening you too. Don't spoil my habits. What will I do after you go away? Kainat will feed you even better food. Time to go now. You too eat! I'll eat later! Okay, bye! Thanks! What are you doing? I have touched and seen your heart. I felt like touching your feet too. Sultana.. Why are you crying? - Nothing! I'm leaving! Where are you going? To leave you till the bus stand. What's happening today? I just can't understand. Nothing. I feel like going with you today. Sometimes I feel that after you go away, I'll feel strange. Won't feel anything. When Kainat comes, you'll forget everything. Like a dream. Some dreams are not forgotten. Okay, good bye! Good bye! It's time to say good bye to this room too. I got a lot from this room. Got lots of respect. Got lots of love. Here, I became a woman from a courtesan. And a wife from a woman... that I could not become. There is so much purity in the word wife. There is so much godliness in this name. Family life is always like a dream for us. I have seen this dream from very close. I am taking this dream with me today. I shall not go to Rahim now. Neither will I go to the market. Where are you going, daughter? Mother is very ill. So I have to go suddenly. Does Dawood know about it? If I had told him he would not let me go. That's true. I shall miss you a lot. Okay! Okay! Daughter, Why do you cry? We shall call you soon. Go safely, and come back safely. Bai Amma. Ameena Bai, taxi has come. Daughter, we shall not forget your favour for life. Come soon! Sister in law, father told me you are going. How are you Nadira? Fine! All thanks to you. Daughter, some food for your journey, and this money. What was need for this? Will a mother send a daughter empty handed? Bai Amma! Good bye daughter! - Good bye, mother! So this was your trick? Rahim Shaikh please let me go, for god's sake! Shut up. This is why you were saying let me live there, it's a matter of his respect? Rahim Shaikh please let me go, I beg of you. No nonsense! Else I'll break your face. You know who I am. Come, let's go. Sultana! Brother, follow that taxi! My Dawood, no one will be so regretful to leave this world, as... ...much I regret going away from your house. But what right do I have over this? Had come without invitation.. ..going without informing. But I am taking away many sweet memories along. The love and respect that I got from here... ...I'll never be able to forget that. You get married to Kainat soon. My love and prayers will always be with you both. If possible do remember this courtesan sometimes. Someone who is taking away a beautiful message from this house. That, every woman is a Koran.. ..if the one reading it is Dawood. Yours, and not yours too. Sultana! The dinner is kept on the table. Do eat it! The dinner is kept on the table. Do eat it! Sultana! Will you not say to come inside? Where did you go away? Wherever I had gone, now I've come back. Never to go back! You didn't have the meal? Couldn't eat without you. Oh no! I'm dead! Sultana! - Yes. Never leave me and go! I'll never go! While you were here, it never felt so. But after you went away, it felt as if... ...I cannot live without you. You have become a permanent part of my life. Really? - Yes. I love you very much, Sultana. But I have always been loving you. Bai Amma (Mother). What are you doing, son? You didn't eat your meal? Sultana had prepared it before leaving. Not hungry! Not just yours, everyone's hunger is dead. No one ate food in the neighborhood today. After Sultana went away, the life here too went away. Don't know whether she has eaten or not, on the way. Won't dance? Won't do business? Even your mother will do whatever I say. No Rahim! I'll give my life away but won't step into your world. Now I won't become a courtesan. Let me see how you won't become! Stupid! Even after being a woman, I felt like a woman only within those four walls. First time I realized that these bangles mean, a sign of a married woman. First time I realized that, the wait to... ...hear the footsteps of the husband after he's left... ...in the morning, is called "awaiting." First time I realized that, only after being called a wife... ...a spirit comes alive in a woman's body. I wasn't a wife, but the misunderstandings about... ...being a wife blew few hearts into this lifeless body of this courtesan. Rahim, I am no more a prostitute. I am woman now. Let me be a woman only! Spending few days with that Dawood... ...has got you out of your mind? You really started thinking that you are his wife? Mahmood, come here! Go and bring that Dawood's dead body from his house... ...and throw it under her feet. Then she will know what I am. - No Rahim! No! Don't do anything to Dawood, I beg of you! Will you dance? Yes, I will do whatever you tell. Now you've come to your place. Get it! Take, get ready! Bloody! You have the promise of Bibi Fatima! Save me from being a courtesan. Gaffur-ul-Rahim, save me! Amen! Who are you? Kainat? Why have you come here? I've come to take you! No, Kainat! No! You go away from here! These people are very cruel. Please go away! No, Sultana! This is not your place. It's Dawood's house. Dawood's house? Whether he has told you or not, but he loves you. I am a woman. I know it well that, you both love each other. And are made for each other. No, Kainat. Now nothing can be done. For god's sake, you go away from here. Tell Dawood that he's got too late. I don't know what's to be done. I'll tell you what's to be done. As a token of my love, you bring Sultana home. Yes. Dawood, the truth is that I can find another Dawood somewhere else. But Sultana will not find another Dawood. No, Kainat. I cannot ask you for such a heavy price. At whatever price you get life, it's cheap. Dawood, you go and get your life back! Kainat, I don't know who life is! Don't lie to yourself, Dawood! You know very well that at this moment.. ..your life is becoming a courtesan at the goon Rahim's place. Strange! You kept her home while she was a courtesan. Now, when she became a woman.. ..you let her go away to become a courtesan, again? A courtesan? Who, courtesan? Tell! Who, courtesan? Sultana! Sultana? A courtesan? "I was waiting since very long." "You took too long to come." "You took too long to come." "I was waiting since very long." "You took too long to come." "You took too long to come." "I was waiting since very long." "You took too long to come." "Savior, you got too late in getting the medicine for this sick." "Got too late getting the medicine." "Couldn't hear few words of love." "Couldn't pick few flowers of honesty." "Couldn't hear few words of love." "Couldn't pick few flowers of honesty." "Oh cruel one, you too had desires for me." "Oh cruel one, you too had desires for me." "Got too late telling it." "Got too late telling it." "I was waiting since very long." "You took too long to come." "You took too long to come." "The desires will die in few moments." "All my memorable dreams shall be shattered." "The desires will die in few moments." "All my memorable dreams shall be shattered." "Always hearing and always taking stock." "Always hearing and always taking stock." "Got too late getting the address." "Got too late getting the address." "I was waiting since very long." "You took too long to come." "You took too long to come." "You took too long to come." "You took too long to come." "You took too long to come." "You took too long to come." "You took too long to come." Sultana! Sultana! Sultana! God, you? If this is a dream, then by god's grace this dream should never be shattered. This is not a dream, Sultana. This is the coming true, of our dreams. I am here for you. Heard this, all of you? Did you hear this cartoon's joke? He shall take away Sultana in the presence of Rahim Shaikh. Sultana! So, will you take her? - Yes. - Is it? Even the military cannot enter our lane, and you will take her away from here? Will you take her? Who are you to look after her? I am her husband! You bloody husband! Courtesans have pimps, not husbands. She is not a Courtesans, but my wife. A wife? In what relationship? In human relationships! In the relationship of Love. Where is the marriage certificate of the priest? When did you marry him? Marriage is the union of two souls, Rahim Shaikh. It's not confined to a piece of paper or a marriage certificate. I have taken her as my wife at heart. You hearty man! Don't talk much about heart. Else, I'll put this knife inside and take your heart out. There'll be a 12 inch hole. Do it! Let there be a competition between cruelty and decency. Rahim Shaikh, let's see if decency is more powerful, or cruelty. Is it? Mohammed! - Yes master! Jaffar! - Yes master! Mahmood! - Master! Show him the face of death! Shut up! - No! Dawood! No! No, Rahim! Rahim, please let Dawood go! Please let him go! Wanted to be a hero, isn't it? Beat him up more! Beat him! - No! Shut up! - No! No! Will you still take Sultana? Rahim Shaikh, even if I die, I'll take Sultana. Cut him into pieces and throw him out! No! No! No! Dawood, no! To save my respect, don't play with your life. A courtesan's destiny only has the courts. Dawood, it is impossible to get out of this court. It is impossible! It is impossible! Did you hear? The girl is right! The entrance to the brothel has fire, once a girl steps on to it... ...her respect is burned away... ...and she becomes a prostitute, and loses her respect. Who builds these entrances of such brothels? Who lights up the fires on those entrances? It's people like you! You bring the decent girls form their families to this brothels. You take away their scarf from their heads and tie the anklets to their feet. This hell is made by you, the fire too is lighted by you. Even if I am to shed my blood to put off this fire.. ..then, I shall shed it, Rahim Shaikh! I shall shed. You talk a lot, really! No, Rahim! No! - Get away! Sultana! What man! What did you say? You'll spill blood for her sake? You'll take her from here? Where will you take her to? To the world of your decent ones? Did you first tell them that you are getting a courtesan as a wife? These keepers of decency, these society people are crueler than us. Within 2 days they'll spit on you and throw you'll out. How will they throws out? Let see who throws out. Who is old woman? I am Dawood's mother! Sultana is my daughter in law. Daughter in law? - Look, Rahim Shaikh! The society has come with respect to take Sultana back home. Yes, we all have come to take Sultana back. Yes, yes, we all have come... - Shut up! What's happening here? What's the chaos here? Son, Dawood, what happened? How did this blood come? Where's Sultana? - There! Hey! What's it? What's it? We've come to take Sultana! Your father's property? You need to have 2 lakh rupees if you want to take her. Do you have? Mr., decent people neither buy nor sell daughters. Hey Decent! Seen this? Keep this knife in your pocket. I am not alone, the entire neighborhood have come... ...to take Sultana. When decent people get into beatings etc., even the heavens shiver. For goons like you, even the graveyards will not give shelter. You people seem to be from decent families. But come to this place of sin, hiding... ...form your wives and daughters to strike deals with the downtrodden girls. To see them being auctioned. Such a shame! If A goon like Rahim Shaikh brigs... ...your daughter, daughter in law or wife, forcefully here, and... ...auctions her body in front of you, what will you'll do? Will you'll sit quietly? Like a stage play? Or, will you'll see her being auctioned, with a glass in your hand? There won't be glass in the hands, sir. Catch! Catch! Catch! There will be handcuffs. Hey! Constable, take him away! His dance will happen in the jail. Take him away! Go! Go! Partner, today our story has been completed! I was looking for a climax for the story. It was a happy ending today. Happy ending? What's all this blood? What's this sad scene? What happened to this Sister in law, Sultana? Open your eyes, Sultana! Look who all have come to take you! Sultana, we have come to take you home. Yes, we have come to take you home. Home? Home? Sister in law, come home, please! Sister in law? Sister in law? Get up, daughter! Get up! Sultana, your awaiting has ended! Your prayer has been accepted! Congratulations to your new life, daughter! Congratulations!
