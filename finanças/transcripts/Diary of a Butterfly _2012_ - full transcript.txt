Hello. - Hi, Gul. How are you? Where are you? - I am good. I am at home. But I am going out after some time. Where are you? What do you mean, where are you? I am busy arranging for your party. What rubbish! When did I say to throw a bash for me? - You didn't say. But I thought I should give you a farewell party before you leave. I don't know when we will meet again. Karan, you are trying to entice me? Sweetheart, I am not enticing you. I like you. I love you. And you know? It's not a crime to love. Karan, you know it very well that I don't have time.. ..for useless things like love. I am focused on my career, man. That's why I am leaving Jaipur and going to Mumbai. Okay. Be focused. Make your career. But reach the party by 9 o'clock. I have called all our friends. I am not too sure, Karan. I will ask my mom and inform you. Okay? No asking. I don't care. You have to come. I will wait for you. Some people are born to wait. I will come. But I will be late. Okay? "Serve me more drinks." "Let me get intoxicated." "Let me see you rock this party and get down with me." "Serve me more drinks." "Let me get intoxicated." "I am young." "Show me the magic." "Give me either whiskey or rum." "Or give me country liquor." "Mix either soda or coke." "Or serve it on the rocks." "I am sloshed, my friend." "The colours of the world got immersed in the bottle." "It's a strong intoxication for this lover boy." "I am in the mood to sing and dance." "The Patiala of love." "Serve me more drinks." "Let me get intoxicated." "Let me see you rock this party and get down with me." "Serve me more drinks." "Let me get intoxicated." "I am young." "Show me the magic." "Give me either vodka or Bacardi." "Or else Jack." "Mix in some love." "Show some moves." "I am ruined. I am beaten." "I am a cool man." "I am in the mood for drinks." "And with that the beauty of your youth." "I am in the mood for drinks." "Let's celebrate and drink." "The Patiala of love." "Serve me more drinks." "Let me get intoxicated." "Let me see you rock this party and get down with me." "Serve me more drinks." "Let me get intoxicated." "I am young." "Show me the magic." "What a trance of youth!" "Do as you please." "Let nights get crazy, beloved." "What a trance of youth!" "Do as you please." "Write a nice saga, beloved." "Serve me more drinks." "Let me get intoxicated." "Let me see you rock this party and get down with me." "Serve me more drinks." "Let me get intoxicated." "I am young." "Show me the magic." "Serve me more drinks." "Let me get intoxicated." "Let me see you rock this party and get down with me." "Serve me more drinks." "Let me get intoxicated." "I am young." "Show me the magic." What are you thinking? You know, Gul. Jaipur will be lonely without you. And you? I have become lonely. It's very late. I have to go home now. Can't you cancel it? What? Going home? Mumbai. - No way, Karan. Mumbai is my dream city. And you know Pia has found such a nice job for me. I can't lose this opportunity. And you can lose me. Karan, path is meant to take travellers to their destination. And not to stop them. Understood? I am just a path for you? You are not my destination too. Fine, Gul. You will meet me once before you leave, won't you? Of course. Go to sleep. Your daughter has returned. Ask her where she was the whole night. Her friends had thrown a bash. Farewell party. She is going to Mumbai. Party is fine. But till 2 o'clock? Her lifestyle here is such. What will she do in Mumbai? I worry when I think about it. Her friend Pia has found her a job. In a fashion house. She will be busy in Mumbai. I don't think so. Well, she is our daughter. She will make us proud. And keep your diary with you. It pricks me the whole night. Shobha. Mother, catch. - Oh, God. Gul. Stop it. Shobha. - Yes. Coming. Sit. Gul, how many clothes will you take? Yes. - Yes. Mother and daughter's meeting is over? - Yes. It's over. Gul. Last night you returned home very late. I didn't like that. I don't like it that you are going to Mumbai. And call.. - And call up as soon as you reach there. Right? Yes. Come on. Let's go and have some breakfast. - Yes, papa. You go. We are coming. - There is still time for her flight. Okay. We are coming. Come on. Come on. - Coming, papa. Coming. Enough. Enough. Enough. - Come on. Okay. - Enough. Enough. Enough. How many clothes will you take? Enough. Come, dear. Whose call was it? Nothing, papa. - You are going to start a new life. I am certain.. - Take this. Thanks, mother. Okay. Yes, of course. Here, baby. Have a banana. It's also good for you. - Thank you, papa. She is so excited to go to Mumbai that she has lost her appetite. Mom, dad, I still have a lot of packing to do. And I don't want to miss my flight. I am going. Bye. - Okay. Okay. I am coming. Sit down. Just pack a sandwich for her. Okay? - Okay. I will do it. And remember one more thing. No late nights. - Yes, dad. Okay? - No late nights. Back home by 12. - Yes. Right? - Right. - Alright. Ram Gopal, done? - Yes, sir. - Thank you. Bye, Ram Gopal. - Bye. Yes, Ravi. 3:30. Okay. I have to go, sweetie. - No. - I am so sorry. I have to go. I will see you in the evening. - Okay. Okay. Okay? - Okay. Bye. See you. Good luck, honey. - Bye, dad. Love you. Yes, Ravi. Okay. One hour. Whose call was it, dear? Wrong number? No, mom. Wrong person. Wrong person. Dear. Your dad is really worried for you. You need to change your lifestyle. Mother, I am not a kid anymore. That's why I am saying, dear. The life that you were leading in Jaipur.. ..you will have to change that when you go to Mumbai. Well. Take this. What is this? - It's a calendar. Read it. And this is a diary. Dear, I just want you to begin a new life. And record each moment of your life in this diary. Okay? Yes, mom. I will write. Anything else? And yes, tell Pia I miss her a lot. Yes, mom. Mumbai, yeah! Come on. Coming, Pia. Two minutes. And how is it going in Jaipur? Everything is fine. Jaipur is still the same old Jaipur. How are mom and dad? - Very well. Very good. Yeah? - Excuse me. Gul, whose call was it? Two hours ago he was my boyfriend. You will never change. Pia, I am Gul. Not the government. Okay. Why don't we go home and talk? No, Carol. We won't go home. It's my first day in Mumbai. It's my first night. We have to go out, get drunk and party. Cheers. - Cheers. Gul. Today's drinking is so much fun. Life is dirty without liquor. Dirty. Stop, Carol. She has got bad. Carol has got bad. Stop. Stop. Stop. Come on. Wow! - Come on. Gul, wait. - Friend.. Oh, God. Why is everyone hushing us? Come on. - It's heavy. We are too drunk. - Pia, it's a very heavy bag. Come on. - Man. Come on. - Oh, God. Come on. - Move. I have the key. Move, Pia. I will open it. Both of you hold the door. The door is moving. The door is moving. Hold the door. Look, I opened it. Gul, we are so lucky. If Gul had not been there.. Are you okay, Carol? Carol, what a house! You have not seen anything. You know? There is a pool. And there is Jacuzzi too. - Wow! Okay. You must enjoy. Okay. Your room is there. Gul. Gul. You don't want to go to office? It's your first day. Oh, no. What's the time? It's 10 o'clock. - Where is Pia? She is sleeping. I am going to my spa. Oh, no. Okay. Okay. Let's get ready fast. Pia. Pia. Pia, get up. Gul, let me sleep. - Pia, it is 11 o'clock. I had to reach office at 10 o'clock. I will be in trouble on the first day itself. Don't worry, Gul. I will talk to Vivek sir. You go. I am coming. Are you sure? Okay. I am taking your car. Okay? Okay. Bye. Excuse me. - Yes. Where is Mr. Vivek's cabin? Are you a model? - No. Mr. Vivek's cabin is ahead. Go straight and turn right. Okay. - Thank you. Hello. I ordered coffee a long time ago. Will you bring it today? Yes. Come quickly. May I come in, sir? - Yeah. Come in. Hello, sir. This is Gul. Yeah. Pia told me about you. Tell me something. Will you come to office at this hour every day? Actually, sir.. - No. No. You don't have to call me sir. I am used to working in a friendly ambiance. So I guess Vivek is fine. - Okay. Come. You got time? It takes you an hour to bring a cup of coffee. Yes, sir. He is the spoilt brat of our office. Delete Singh. - Hello, ma'am. Delete Singh? - Yes. Tell her how come your name is Delete Singh? Ma'am, it's a tragic story. Soon after birth, my father got deleted. On my sixth day naming ceremony.. ..my grandma got deleted, ma'am. - Oh, my God. Wherever I go.. In short, wherever he goes, somebody gets deleted. But he proved to be lucky for our company. Fortunately for us. Okay. - Yes. Now, leave from here. Come on. - Okay, sir. Who will take this? - Sorry, sir. Sorry, sir. Bye, ma'am. Bye. - Go. Go. Yeah. I hope you understand you are very lucky.. ..you got a chance to work in my company. - Yes, sir. Adi, come in. Sit. That's Gul. Adi. Hi. - Hello. Creative director of the company. And this man is also the backbone of the company. - Yeah. Red Chillies' design is ready? I am working on it. It will be ready by tomorrow. I am putting her under your charge from today. From today she will assist you. Okay? - Great. Fine then, welcome. Congrats. My pleasure, sir. - You're on. Come So, if there is anything you need, just let me know. Sure. Sure. Hi. - Hi. So, how are you, Adi? - I am good. Thanks. You? I am good too. So how is your first day in the office, Gul? Going great so far. - Yeah? That's really nice. So how did you find Gul? She seems nice enough. We will see how she does in the office. I am sure she is going to do well. She is my friend, after all. - Yeah. Anyway, you guys carry on. I will see you later. Yeah? You witch.. 'I am writing this diary only because..' '..my mom wants me to maintain a diary.' 'My first day in office today.' Gul. Hi, mom. How are you? I am fine. You tell me. I told you to call me up after you reach office. I am so sorry, mom. I was very busy with office work. You always make excuses. Your papa misses you a lot. Okay. Tell me. How is your office? Very good, mom. Even my boss is very friendly. Gul. Okay, mom. I got to go. Pia is calling me. I am very late for office. Listen. Listen. Listen. Gul, did you start writing in the diary? Yes, mom. I have filled six pages. Very good. Keep writing. You have thrust your nuisance on me. But I am enjoying it. It's going okay. - Gul. Okay, mom. I have to go. - Are you ready? Okay? Bye. Bye. - Okay, dear. Take care of yourself. Bye. - Bye. I am ready. I just have to change and come. - Alright. Okay. - Hey, girls. - Hey. Hey. - I have movie tickets. Let' go. I can't come. This evening I have to go for Umbrella.. ..Creations' press conference with Vivek sir and Adi. Pia, you will come, won't you? No, sweetheart. Even I have to meet my old friends. But you can do one thing. - What? Go with Aakash. - Who is Aakash? You don't know Aakash (Sky)? I know. It's above. - Correct. He is always above her. She is Aakash's ground. Thank you. - Yes, sir. Hi. - Come. Baby, where were you? You said you will come in ten minutes. See this. Whole 25 minutes have passed. You are always late. I have finished dinner. And see this. Bill has also arrived. I am so sorry, darling. You had dinner? - Yes. Let's go. - Hang on. I have to pay the bill. - Let it be. Let it be. Seriously? - Let it be. Sure? Hello. Hello. Hi. I am Xavier. I hope you all know me. You know me. You must also know that for the past 20 years.. ..our company is the leading fashion company all over the world. And for the first time in 20 years our company.. ..has decided to work with Indian designers and stylists. And whichever company's designs are selected.. ..our company will sign a contract with them.. ..for not one, not two, not three, but for 10 years. But you have only ten days for this job. So all the best. But start the work tomorrow morning. Right now, go ahead enjoy the party. Alright? - Definitely. Careful, Mr. Bajaj. Hi, Vivek. - Yeah. Hi. And hello to the pretty lady. Ravi Bajaj. Gul. - Gul? Really nice name. Thank you. - Ozone Overseas. It's a small company. Maybe you have heard the name. Your style of calling a big company small.. ..and thus calling yourself big is great. You are late, Mr. Bajaj. Umbrella Creations' conference is over. It doesn't make any difference. He is a victim of overconfidence. He thinks he is going to get Umbrella Creations' order. Continue dreaming, Mr. Bajaj. This time we will get the order. Okay. Anyway, see you. - Sure. All the best. See you. - Bye. Let's go. - Yeah. 'Because she loves sex as much as I do. Okay?' 'Sex is just an activity to you, isn't it?' Let's utilize our Sunday. Let's rearrange the furniture. Actually. Come on, Gul. Let's do it. Come on, Carol. You have everything. You are so successful. Hire a maid to do all these chores. I can afford ten maids. But one achieves success with.. ..patience, honesty and hard work. That's why I do these small household chores. It's not my job. Even in Jaipur my servants do all this. I have come to Mumbai to be very famous. And in this small life I have many great things to do. I have to go far ahead. Pia, I don't understand Gul's lifestyle. You will understand, Carol. When I will have a bigger house than you, a car.. ..and 25 servants, you will understand everything. Come on, Carol. Let's go. Come on. Let her watch TV. 'And all this on Sunday.' 'Yeah! - Yeah!' "Forgive.." Yeah. Come in. Sir.. - Sit. Sit. Sit. RB is very confident this time. It's RB's habit to tell tall tales. You should never underestimate your competitor. Right? I want only Flora Enterprises to get Umbrella Creations' order. For that we will have to make such designs that Umbrella Creations.. ..signs the next 10 years' agreement only with our company. Don't worry, sir. We will try our best. Not try. Results. Definitely. You are working so hard. It's very late. Go to sleep. Coming. I will just finish this and come. Okay? Hey. - Hey. I will see you. - Yeah. The designs. What is this? Along with your time why are you wasting our time as well? But have a look.. If our company starts working on the sketches made by you.. ..we will even stop getting the few contracts that we have got. Unbelievable! Hey. - Hey. What happened? There is some problem. Where are you going? To have a smoke. Pia. - Yes, sir. Where is Gul? - She must be around in the office. Where is Adi? He has gone for a smoke. - Gone for a smoke. Alright. Thanks. Adi. - Hi. What do you think? By when will Umbrella Creations' designs be ready? It will take another three-four days, sir. The workload is very heavy. Gul is there to help you. She must have also prepared some designs. I have thrown her sketches in the dustbin. She is new. She will learn gradually. We should close Flora Enterprises and start a fashion institute. Along with Gul everybody else will also learn. Hold it. Hold it there. Just stop kidding. If she is not talented, sack her. Throw her out. You know we are short of time. It is better you do this job. Let's see. 'If she is not talented, sack her.' 'Throw her out.' 'I have thrown her sketches in the dustbin.' What happened? You have still not got ready. What is this? Who wrote this? Mom. - Your mom is great. Gul, since the time you have returned from office.. ..you seem very upset. Today was my last day in office. What happened? - What? It's a long story. Come on. Let's just go out for dinner. Are you sure, Gul? - Yeah. I am sure. Come on. Let's just go. - Both of you go. I am tired. I want to sleep. You are sure? - Okay. Let's just go. Alright. Yes. I will show you. First let me.. Yes. Yes. See this. - Show. I was.. Hello. Hi. May I join you? Great. What are you drinking? - How are you doing? That's the wine. - Fantastic. Great! - Yeah. I know I love drinking wine. So we thought.. - Really? ..we will buy ourselves a wine. Actually, yes.. And that's my favourite wine. So how are you feeling in Mumbai? - Yeah. I think it's good. I mean, yeah, you know, as long as I have good friends. Of course. Should we go somewhere else? Yeah. So goodnight. - So you guys are leaving. Yeah. I will see you later. Okay? See you. So Gul, tell me. What else do you do to wind out? I mean, I really like the person.. Wow! Beautiful. Excellent. Fantastic. That's really nice. Adi. Wonderful! Wonderful! Did you make this? - No. Gul has made it. You were saying she doesn't know anything. She knows many things. Okay. - Actually, I was wrong about her talent. Rectify your mistake. She should be promoted. Where is she? Where is Gul? She was toiling the whole night, sir. She is sleeping. Hey, Pia. - Hey. Hey, Gul. Where were you the whole night? Don't ask. I saved my job. That's good. But how? Well, last night I showed my work. I will be promoted soon. Congratulations. So today's dinner is your treat. Okay? Done. Tell Carol as well. Cool. How did you come here? Wow, Carol! It's amazing! I also feel like doing something. Shall I go for a shoulder massage? Very funny. Go out. We will meet for dinner. Okay. Okay. Okay. We will meet for dinner. But what about lunch? I am very busy right now. I can't. Please go. Okay. Okay. Okay. Give me some money then. What? - Yes. I have to pay the taxi fare, the newspaper bill. If I have lunch. I will have to give a tip to the waiter. Enough. Enough. Enough. - After that in the evening we have.. Give me money. I will take all. How much is it? I don't know. I gave you what I had. Please go. Okay, baby. Sweetheart, see you at dinner. Carol should have come. - Yeah. I don't know what she does with Aakash. Hey. Hi. Come on over. Why don't you sit? I will just join you in a minute. Yeah. Sure. Hi. - Hi. How are you? Good. How are you? - Have a seat. Thank you. Would you like a drink? - No. I am good. I know your speciality, Gul. You are handling Umbrella Creations' account, aren't you? Yes, Mr. Bajaj. There is one thing common between us. A hunger for success. I can sense that about you. I see the same hunger in you. You want to be very, very successful. Nothing wrong with that. The only difference is you work too hard. I have a philosophy. Party hard. And work smart. For instance this waiter. How many hours does he work? 10? 12? 14? I mean, I don't know. How much money does he earn? Look at me. I work for three to four hours. And both of us know how much money I earn. That's why I have an offer for you. Join my company. Get my company Umbrella Creations' contract. Salary, whatever you want. A dream house. A dream car. The works basically. What do you say to that, Gul? Thank you. Really. For the offer. I will think about it. So I will see you later then. - Okay. Take care. - Alright. It was him. Ozone's Mr. Bajaj. Really? Was it? - Yeah. You didn't know? No. Not at all. Vivek. - Hi. How are you? Good. How are you? - Hi, Vivek sir. Hi, my mother. - What? Got hurt? I will call you mother whenever you call me sir. Okay. Well, Gul, let's leave. - Pia, two minutes. So how come you are here? I just came here for dinner. Anyway, I saw your designs. Lovely. They are awesome. - Thank you. Thank you. You hid the secret for so long. Well, Vivek, I tried to show you my designs before. But.. I couldn't show it. What do you mean, couldn't show it? I don't understand. Shall we meet tomorrow and talk? Few things I need to tell you. Yeah. Fine. Okay. Okay. I will see you then. - See you. Ma'am, hold on. I will give it. Take this. Sir, here is your lemonade and honey. And towel. You didn't bring today's newspaper? Sir, I am searching for today's newspaper since yesterday. Shall I bring yesterday's newspaper? Yes. If possible, bring a few years' old newspaper. Bring 30-40 years' old. If you can bring it. Sir, I am reading you for the past 40 years. But sir, sorry. You don't look like you are 40, sir. Go. - You look a few months younger, sir. Now, you disappear and bring the newspaper. Come on. Sir, not the newspaper but the news is here. Yes. Mind your own business. Leave. I will say good morning to ma'am. - Leave. Good morning, ma'am. - Delete, you are here too? I follow sir wherever he goes. Have a seat. Sir is coming. - Okay. Okay, ma'am. Hi. - Hi. How did you come here suddenly? I told you yesterday I will meet you today. Yes. Right. Have a seat. - Okay. You came at the right time. Otherwise I was going to leave soon. Well, my mother says time favours those who value it. Does she? - Yes. Your mother is very intelligent. If I get a chance, I would like to meet her. For sure. Tell me. What will you have? I am good, sir. I had breakfast just now. If you will call me sir here, you know what I am going to say. I know. I know. Mother. Anyway. I saw your designs. You seem very talented. But why did you take so much time to express your talent? I didn't take time, Vivek. Those whom you trust a lot, they took time. My designs were ready since a long time. What do you mean? Who? I don't want to take anybody's name. Fine. Don't take names. I understand a bit. But Gul, if I trust someone, I trust him completely. What if somebody breaks your trust? It hasn't happened so far. If it happens, I wouldn't want to see his face again. Can you do that? - Yeah, of course. If I trust my employees, it's their duty to uphold my trust. And not break it. It's your duty to live up to my trust. I understand. It's simple. If I take care of people, they should also take care of me. Of course. So I guess. A hand searches for another hand. I hope you understand what I am saying. I will see you in the office. - Yeah. Sure. Bye. Sir, newspaper is here. Keep it in the car. I have to go to office. Yes, sir. - I am coming. Go. Yes, sir. Adi, come into my cabin. Yeah. Come in. Did I ask you to sit? You have so disappointed me, Adi. It's not funny. I had never imagined that I will have to.. ..hear something like this about you. Let me tell you. This is the last time I am hearing this. I don't understand, sir. Nothing is left for you to understand. Tell me the truth. Sorry, sir. I still don't understand. Fine. No problem. If that's the way you want to play. Let me tell you something. I know everything. When you threw away Gul's design the first time.. ..that is when I understood you have some game plan. Sir, actually then.. Lie remains a lie regardless of how many times you speak it. Please, sir. Listen to me. I don't want people like you who exploit in my company. Exploit. - Don't waste my time, Adi. I don't need players like you. You can leave. You are fired. Fine, sir. It will take you some time to understand.. ..who the actual player is. That too an expert player. Get out of here. It's said it is okay if a man doesn't have a bank balance. But it's very important to have brains. Get out I said. Out. Good day, Mr. Vivek. Gul. From today you will handle Umbrella Creations' account. Okay? Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. - Yeah. I need money desperately, Carol. Pia. Who is with Carol? Who? Him? He is her boyfriend. What is he doing? It's their everyday's scene. She is giving him money. Amazing! Other men sustain their girlfriends. And she is sustaining her boyfriend. Forget it. Thank you, baby. I am leaving. See you. Bye. - Bye. Come on. Pia told me you slept with Adi. Only to save your job. What kind of girl you are? - Talented. You think it's a talent to spend the night with someone? What else? See Pia, Carol. She is working as an accountant for the past five years. She is still at the same place from where she had started. Look at me. In such a short period I have become the creative director. But for that you had to stoop so low. If you are eyeing big dreams.. ..you have to stoop low. Your chemistry is beyond me. You understand Aakash's chemistry. Your darling Aakash acts smugly. He extracts money from you. Is it his father's earning? See, this is my personal matter. I have not posted my personal matter on the net. This is my personal matter too. She is soaring high. She will fall down very soon. Madam, yesterday's movie was just amazing. It had our model. What is happening in this office? Oh God, sir is here. - What's going on here? What are you doing? Come on, get back to work. Where is Gul? Send Gul. Sir, shall I get coffee? - Shut up. Get on with your work. Did you call me? Do what know what happened? I don't know. How did RB get the orders that our company was supposed to get? I don't know. - Yes. Then who is supposed to know this? Who is supposed to know this? You have ruined all my expectations. And I have no place for people like you in my office. You can leave. What are you looking at? Get out. Get lost. Out. Is Mr. Bajaj there? - Yes. Come in. Gul. Welcome. - Hi. Gul, I have told you before. I just love the name. I mean what a beautiful name and what a beautiful lady. Thank you for the compliment. The compliment seems good if the one accepting it is good. Thank you once again. No. Thanks to you. Our company got such a big contract all thanks to you. You did an amazing job. Well done. Thank you, Mr. Bajaj. But as far the information I have.. ..your company didn't try as hard to get this contract.. ..as our company. I mean Flora Enterprises did. Why are you saying so? Before you came after the party was over.. ..for Xavier's party. If you would've need the contract that badly.. ..you would've come on time. I'm proud of you. Brilliant. I am glad that I chose you for my company. Thank you. But now that we are on this, tell me something. The thing that you should've started earlier, you.. That's a different story. That night, Vivek told me that I am victim of over confidence. Only his company will get this contract. Do you remember? - Of course? I wanted to remind him of his place. I wanted to put that arrogant rascal in his place. That's why I gave you this job. Well, I successfully completed the job you gave me. It's your turn. The people who know me also know that.. ..when I make a promise, I do keep it. So here goes. Here are your car keys. And this is your house key. No. no. I mean your bungalow's keys. Thank you. - You're welcome. And there is one more surprise for you. This. The key of one more car. You'll go to work in that car. You need to go around, isn't it? So here goes. Thank you, Mr. Bajaj. And welcome to the organization. See you. - See you in the morning. Alright? I hope and pray that you come to your sense very soon. I am afraid your arrogance might ruin you. I had told you against coming here, didn't I? Carol, your spa is very romantic. There is a spark in here. So I thought of romancing here. What are you doing? Let's go out somewhere if not here, Carol. I am on duty. Go. You work every day, Carol. Sometimes work for me too. Think about me too. I also need money. - I said I am working. Leave. Hello Gul. - What are you doing? What are you doing? Still in the office. I am very busy. The workload is immense. Okay. I got some breaking news for you. I have joined Ravi Bajaj's company with Xavier's order. Congrats. - Yes. Thank you. And second good news. I have got a new house and a new car from the company. You, Carol and me are going to go out and party tonight. Treat is one. Okay. So come home quickly. Okay. You guys carry on. I'll see if I can catch you later. Yes? - Oh. I'll miss you. Okay. Bye. Hey Carol, where are you? I am upstairs in my room. I am in the pool. I have some good news. Come fast. - Okay, coming. - See you. Hey. - Why are you so happy? And whose cars are those outside? That car is mine. This was the good news I wanted to give you. I have joined a new company, Carol. - Right. I told you. I will go places. I am so happy for you. But I am very upset. What happened? Aakash, my boyfriend. He always wants money from me. And I am fed up of giving him money. Oh. Don't worry. We're going to go out tonight and we're going to party. And have fun. "Go, sisters. Go, sisters." "Got to party tonight." "Go, sisters. Go, sisters." "Got to get a new boy. Yeah." "Go, sisters. Go, sisters." "Got to party tonight." "Go, sisters. Go, sisters." "Got to get a new boy. Yeah." "Go. Got to party tonight." "Go. Got to party tonight." "Boys. To hell with boys." "We don't need boys." "We got each other." "Girls. We make the rules. And break the rules." "We got each other." "The boys are naughty. These boys are na�ve." "Who needs boys?" "We are having fun. As it is we are sloshed." "What else do we want?" "We have to live. And drink carefree." "We'll do as we please." "This world is smitten by us." "The evening comes alive because of us." "We'll groove, sing and dance." "What time will you come?" "With whom will you go?" "Why was the phone switched off?" "Why took you so long shopping?" "Why go jogging so early?" "Why the unnecessary fuss?" "Say what?" "Boys. To hell with boys." "We don't need boys." "We got each other." "Girls. We make the rules. And break the rules." "We got each other." "The boys are naughty. These boys are na�ve." "Who needs boys?" "We are having fun. As it is we are sloshed." "What else do we want?" "Got to party tonight." "They are liars as well." "They sleep like a log." "They'll never hear you completely." "They do as they please." They fight like kids. "And then they make innocent faces." "You've been missing since two days in this monsoon.." "..and in the season of romance "All the wining. All the dining." "All the smelling. But you still look for other options." "Boys. No." "The boys are naughty. These boys are na�ve." "Who needs boys?" "We are having fun. As it is we are sloshed." "What else do we want?" "The boys are naughty. These boys are na�ve." "Who needs boys?" "We are having fun. As it is we are sloshed." "What else do we want?" Carol. Carol. - "Go sisters. Go sisters. Got to party tonight." When I asked money from you, you said you don't have. And this party and drama here. What's all that? I want you to earn. Look, I want money. Give me money. Aakash, I can't. You can't? You hit me? Yes, I did. What the hell are you doing? Aren't you ashamed? Look, this is our personal matter. Come, baby. - Oh, just shut up and don't touch her. Don't make the mistake of coming here again. Get it? Get lost. Rascal. Come on, Carol. - Carol. Carol. Go to sleep, Carol. I also have to wake up early tomorrow. I have to do the shifting and packing. You sleep, Gul. I can't sleep. As it is, you have to go from here in the morning. And not me. All I can do is sleep. Carol, why are you sounding so pessimistic? There are only problems in my night. And no one has the solution. Do you know what your problem is? You show your wounds to the ones who don't have a remedy. And they make fun of you upon hearing your problem. My mother says your best friend is the mirror in the house. It doesn't laugh when you cry.. ..but cries along with you. What do I do, Gul? I am at my wits end. I'll tell you what you should do? First of all, throw Aakash out of your life. Carol. He is having fun with your money. Can't you see it? He is torturing you and you are enduring his torture. Remember one thing in life. Tolerating injustice also helps the tormentor. How can someone who can't help himself help someone else? Don't give up. Every dark cloud has a silver lining. You'll see that silver lining. I'll go now. Okay. Sleep well. Good night. Pia, I am going. Where is Carol? Carol has gone for a shower. But why are you in such a hurry to shift? The luggage has reached. The car is waiting. I must go. Come, drop me. - Come. I'll drop you. I'll call you in the evening. - Okay. "You are here somewhere." "I am here somewhere." "But still this distance exists." Here. Here we are. Your Sunday shopping is done. Hey! Gul's phone. One second. Hello Gul. Hi, mother. - Hi, dear. Mother, I have got a new job. And company has given me a new car and a new bungalow. And guess what? My house is bang in front of the race course. Isn't that amazing? Okay. Now you and father come to me quickly. But Gul, how did this happen so quickly? Mother, all is well here. Life is beautiful. Come here. I hope you're not doing anything wrong. - Ramgopal. Mother. - Okay. Fine. You take care of yourself. Okay. I'll see you. So.. It was Gul. She shifted her job. A new bungalow and a new car. I don't like this. It's too much too soon. 'My first day in my dream home in Mumbai.' Carol. Carol. Carol. Oh no. Gul. Yes Pia. Gul, where are you? Come fast. Carol.. - What? Carol. Nothing's going to happen to you. You'll be fine. Carol. Yes. Okay doctor. Pia. Pia, what happened? Gul, Carol has slit her wrist. - Why? You know she is such a big emotional fool. She is crazily in love with Aakash. Last night she had a fight with Aakash. And today she did this to herself. - What? I think we'll have to stay with her today. Sorry, Pia. I can't stay here. What are you saying? You mean you don't sympathize with carol at all, Gul. What has she done that deserves sympathy? He took away her money. Slapped her. If it was me, I would've thrashed that rascal. He wouldn't even dare to look at a girl. But Carol madam. What has she done? She was out to kill herself instead of killing him. Pia, I have no time for an emotional fool like Carol. Now I know how selfish you are. I am ashamed of calling you my friend. Then good luck with being ashamed, Pia. I am going. Good morning, sir. My name is Aditya Singh Rajput. Mr. Bajaj has.. You? I mean madam. Adi, how do you feel seeing me here? I can't believe that you are Ozone Company's managing director. But this is the truth. You wanted to get me fired, isn't it? I got you fired. And today you are standing in front of me. If I knew that you are here, I would've never made.. ..the mistake of coming here. So rectify your mistake. And get lost. I didn't mind what you said because I consider.. ..girls like you to be handicam. You wish to touch the sky by using your beautiful bodies. But one day you drop so hard from their high perch.. ..that even people who are watching learn a lesson from it. You're climbing up the ladder very fast. And you'll drop to the ground very soon. MD madam. Till then goodbye. See you. Mr. Bajaj's new formula. Anyone he gets smitten by becomes the MD. Business as well as an affair. And our MD's formula? She is visiting every flower for the nectar. Her name should be butterfly and not Gul. Pal, this is a well planned successful scheme. 'Her name should be butterfly and not Gul.' 'I consider..' '..girls like you to be handicam.' 'You wish to touch the sky by using your beautiful bodies.' 'Her name should be butterfly and not Gul.' 'If you have ever hurt someone, do apologize to him once.' "Don't try to be ahead of time." 'And yes. Don't ever use shortcuts to be successful.' 'Now I know how selfish you are.' 'I am ashamed of calling you my friend.' 'I feel I have also made some mistakes.' 'And some relationships have gone sour.' 'And now I'll try to fix those relationships first. 'Because mother had once said.' 'Mistake is a single page in the part of life.' 'But relationship is a complete book.' 'So don't lose a full book for a single page.' Here. You look so weak. Here. Eat. You are so weak. Yes. Yes. Eat. Eat. You'll get strength if you eat. You'll work hard if you get strength. You'll earn money if you work hard. And he'll enjoy with your money. Madam, she is my girlfriend. I can eat her or her money. It's none of your business. - Oh, shut up and mind your language. I can't believe it, Carol. I can't even imagine that you'll see him again.. ..after all that happened. Don't make me angry or.. This is my life. And who are you to interfere in my life? He took away your money. He raised his hand on you. Compelled you to die. And you say that.. Shut up. Aakash is my life. He can eat me or my money. It's none of your business. Oh darling, I love you. Why are you still here? Get lost. I am going. But I'll definitely say this before leaving. A person must not make so many mistakes.. ..that he is not able to erase them. I have also made mistakes. That's why I wanted to apologize to you. But you know what? It's not worth it. Pia. Pia. "Get up. Get up. Get up." "Get up. Get up. Get up." Adi, what are you doing here? Who are you to ask me? This is not your house anymore. This is my friend's house. Friend who? Whose friend? You have severed all the ties of being a friend, Gul. Pia, I would've never come here if I wanted to sever this tie. You would've never come, isn't it? Gul, I called you here from Jaipur. I kept you with me. I helped you in establishing your career. And what did you do? She got rid of me. She clipped the wings of the one who taught her to fly. You had also tried doing the same. Remember, Adi? Don't be smart. Just get lost. I don't even want to see your face. Do you think I would like to see your face after today? So why are you here? Actually, I was obsessed with achieving my goal. And the one who have their sights set on their goal.. ..don't care about the path. But today I thought I have hurt many people on this path. I wanted to apologize to you. But now I have realized. You don't deserve this. "Hey, who's hungry?" Hi Gul. - Karan. What's the matter? How come you've called up after so long? Karan, I need you. Can you please come to Mumbai for me? Right now. - What happened? Is everything alright? All is not well, Karan. I am really lonely. I really need you with me. Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll take the next flight to Mumbai. I'll come to the airport to pick you. "My Jugni.." "My Jugni.." "The one who is in love." "My Jugni.." "My Jugni.." "She takes the name.. ." "The name of her beloved." "She takes the name of her beloved." "Like a prayer." "Love is sweeter than honey." "Youth is for a short time." "Your foundation is nothing." "Everything else is of no use." "My Jugni.." "My Jugni.." "My Jugni.." "She takes the name.. ." "The name of her beloved." "She takes the name of her beloved." "Like a prayer." "Youth is short-lived, lets enjoy it." "There is no guarantee of life.' "Don't waste time." "Once youth is gone.." "..it will not return." "My Jugni.." "My Jugni.." "She takes the name.. ." "The name of her beloved." "She takes the name of her beloved." "Like a prayer." "My Jugni.." "My Jugni.." "My Jugni.." "My Jugni.." And that's my house. Wow. Wow. Your house is really beautiful. Thank you. Okay. Why don't you sit? I'll just change and come. Okay? Sure. How about we go for a dinner? Don't worry. We'll go for dinner as well. Karan. Karan. Karan. Karan. Karan. Oh. Hi, sweetheart. So how is the weather in Mumbai? Mumbai's? Where are you, Karan? And why are you disconnecting my call? Oh. I am so sorry. You felt bad that I disconnected your call. And darling, what about the 200 times.. ..when you had disconnected my calls? What? I thought you loved me. Why are you doing this? Love. Darling, the world love doesn't sound good coming from you. Forget it. Do call me if you come to Jaipur. You've showed your true colors, haven't you? And now tell your friends my stories. Rascal. 'This dairy has started to make me uneasy.' 'These pages filled with black ink seem like dark nights to me.' 'And these blank white pages seem like bright lights.' 'I had promised mother that I'll write diary..' '..so that I stay connected to my memories.' 'And but I think there is a slight difference between..' '..promise and memories.' 'Humans break promises.' 'And memories shatter a human.' Now I'll have to stop writing this diary in order to.. ..stop myself from falling to pieces. Hi, mother. - Hi, dear. What a surprise. You've called up your mother after so long. Or it's me who calls you. By the way, what are you doing? You must be writing the diary. No, mother. And I have called you up to tell you that.. ..I'll stop write this diary from right now. But why? What I am saying is right, mother. I want to get rid of this diary now. But what will you gain by if you stop writing the diary, Gul? What did I gain even when I was writing, mother? The pages of the diary in which I would mention the moments of joy. Now they're trying to give me pain. Want to give me tears. And now I am not going to let that happen. Look Gul, happiness and sorrow are two sides of the same coin. History always repeats itself. The pages that are you giving you sorrow.. ..will give you joy in the future, dear. The diary you're writing is not a diary. It's the mirror of your life, dear. How can a lifeless diary be a mirror, mother? A mirror is a person's heart. Good luck with your diary. I will not write. Gul, come back. I can't come back now, mother. I have just made my path that will lead me to success. And the path I have taken will end only once I reach my destination. I have a long way to go, mother. When I was writing the diary, I realized the paths have shrunk. And I have locked up time. I want to release time by getting rid of this diary. Gul, Japanese delegates will be reaching here in a few minutes. Are all the documents ready? Yes, they are. I'd appreciate if you treat office like one. Not like some salon. Well, office means business. And business means profits. And as long as I get you profit, I think you should be least.. ..bothered whether I put on a nail paint or lipstick or I dance. Right? - Right. Right. "There is chaos." "There is chaos." "We gambled in the game of life." "Turned the tables. And changed the scenario." "We got the share of a bit of the world." "The world lost to us when we won." "It's okay if you do it." "But when I did it, it created a storm." "It created a storm." "It created a storm." "It created a storm." "The shadows of glistening conspiracies." "The shadows.. "These heady nights brought with it fragrant and intoxicating colors." "It created a storm." "It created a storm." "So many faces. One of them is mine." "You get envious when it shines through." "Let people talk about me too." "The season of desires will not revisit." "There's merriment all around." "When I tried soaking it all in, it created a storm." It created a storm." It created a storm." "It created a storm." "A storm." "A storm." "There's merriment all around." "When I tried soaking it all in, it created a storm." It created a storm." It created a storm." It created a storm." Gul, come here. Meet our guests from Japan. Kumatsu Hi. - Pleased to meet you. - Hi. Mr. Razumi. - Hi. And this is Gul. Take them to the conference room. Sure. - Please make yourself comfortable. - Come. I'll just join you in a while. Gentlemen. Have you ever been to Japan? Japan. I'll be going there very soon now that I've found you. "My Jugni.." "My Jugni.." "The one who is in love." "My Jugni.." "My Jugni.."
