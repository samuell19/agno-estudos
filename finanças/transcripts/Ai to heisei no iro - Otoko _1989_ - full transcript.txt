Thank you for calling Sorry I can't answer your call now Please leave a message I'll call back as soon as possible Hello... Are you at home? I'll come and clean your house today! I'll arrive in a minute Hello... Hello... Are you having a shower? I'm on the way to your house No problem, right? You're not at home? Why? Hello? Are you alive? You make me worried You called me here? What happened? I promised to come and clean your house today You forgot about it? I came here to purify my soul Where are you now? Somewhere unimaginable Doing what? Practising Saxophone in my car I want you to purify my soul too Just now I thought you were dead I'm so lonely. I miss you. Are you troubled? I want to tell you something important Something important? What? I can't tell you right now This will make me worried I want to marry you I'll say it again I WANT TO MARRY YOU May I think about it for a few days Why? That's why I wanted to discuss that with you at home Somewhere in time Water of Tokyo turned to look like withered Sakura... But I'm too indecisive How many times have this happened? I have to hide at my sister's house I should be more determined! In such an energetic city how come there's hardly any activities in the morning When it comes to the Heisei era Baseball seems to have become more interesting A city that has nothing to do with me Everybody seems to be a stranger I want very much to have a dream But in fact, I can't sleep well at night I look energetic, but am in fact exhausted If there is a pretty woman who can make me sleep tight A girl who can wake me up in the morning... What? You want a pretty woman? You want what? Why mumbling early in the morning... Don't disturb me! Overhearing others is no different from... peeking at their diaries Very bad indeed! You still can't go to sleep? Why don't you take some sleeping pills? I can't sleep unless there is a pretty woman who can make me exhausted You are a freak! It's you who are a freak Already 22 years old and still a virgin Who will approach me when there is... such a freak living here You have your own house Why don't you stay there? I have my difficulties I have my difficulties too I'll make a salad for you as a compensation I won't be happy with such minor thing I better eat cornflakes with milk Of course I manage to do such simple thing I don't understand you at all Sleeping is one of the ways that makes a woman beautiful It is very important to woman So don't mumble and wake me up ever again! To a man... Having a sister like you is a disaster She is the only woman whom I can't understand But at least she doesn't sleep around. That's good You can wash your mouth now I'm wet with the mouth wash That's because I gave you a local anaesthetic so your mouth can't move at your will Why I'm like having a dementia? I have a date today... It's meaningless to kiss my boyfriend with my mouth like this! How long will the anaesthetist last? When will meet your boyfriend? At midnight There should be no problem The effect of the anaesthesia will have gone by that time When my mouth is painful you'll give me pain—killers, right? In general, yes But I don't want you to kiss your boyfriend So it's better not to give you any pain—killers You're bullying me! It has been a hard time for you Go and take your pain—killers at the counter That is? How disappointing! Take care Showing such an annoying face He is indeed irritating Now choose the colour of your false tooth OK Thank you Well... Love affair in office is not allowed Love affair in office? Women are intuitive... That woman likes you That woman? She is my... Your wife? I've told you I won't get married Yes, you can't You're ours Which colour do you like? Which one is better? How about No.1 Isn't it too white? The difference is too obvious, isn't it? How troublesome you are How about No.4 then? I also think No.4 is better I'm like choosing a wedding ring with you False tooth can bite squid But a wedding ring can't even bite the finger Once I have my false tooth fixed I can't see you any more. Is that right? You can come to clean your teeth Can we have a date? I know you belongs to us all But please spare some time with me I'm fully booked these weeks Good night Being able to fall asleep once saying 'Good night'... is perhaps the most blissful thing in this world Look, here is the timer I came to watch your show just now Of course I knew it And my show tonight was dedicated for you Why leave me then? I misunderstood the meaning of freedom I want to talk about our marriage My marriage with you is perhaps God's will God's will? I don't believe it I only believe in our love But marriage concerns not only about us but also my parents, relatives and my troublesome sister I want to meet your sister... Let's go visit her tonight Don't be surprised when you see her If she is prettier than me I may feel a little surprised then Let's meet her another day Why? I want to have it over as soon as possible Who is it? Your brother Ruriko, a guest is here tonight She is my fiancee Fill the glass with water Don't spill it. Hold it with both hands and sit properly Can I give up halfway? Stop complaining! Me too? Of course I can't believe it You can't trust him How can you spend the rest of your life with my brother I won't even think about it We are not like you You need to depend on nothing It seems I've had a nightmare I hope you understand that marriage concerns not only about us It also concerns our parents and relatives My parents are excited about it They said their daughter—in—law must be virtuous My relatives care about nothing but money My sister is a bit better when compared with them She is more superstitious than me I want to get away from all these That's why I play sax Why a couple who love each other can't get married Many social problems will arise If we concern only about ourselves I don't care about the society That's why I can't get married easily It's such a difficult decision for me I decide not to marry you You are miserable Let's find a place and play sax Find a place and play sex? I can't do that right now I want to play the last song for you ...using my saxophone The only audience is you, who are now driving away from me I'm sorry I misheard you I'll take you home Women can adjust themselves... according to different situations In a suite with two bathrooms I think of our first night together We bought a melon from the vegetable shop cut in half in the room and ate together That was the most luxurious night... I have ever had That's enough Don't keep talking about the past If I was a fan of yours we wouldn't have ended up like this Will you continue playing saxophone Perhaps I'll become a dentist Will it be too late to start now I'll remember it for the rest of my life Me too Which song do you want me to play for you? Goodbye. You've made up your mind, right? I'm no good in telling lies Separation is just a phase Good morning Your reward Well done It's time to stop I want to agree with you I want a brother who'll agree with me You have your insomnia cured? Not yet, but I don't feel tired A strong man who never feel tired I'm not gentle to you But please try to be gentle to me sometimes Well... We haven't been to a disco for long There is a new disco in Ginza Let's go together I'll pick you up after work Put on a beautiful dress I'll wait for you She can be easily cheated Good to have such a sister Let's take a rest I've waited for long before you said this I'll take you some food Thank you Though I say so I don't have much expectation on the food and drink here Just don't want the table to be too empty Really? It's troublesome to see a dentist Have to make an appointment, just like the driving school And you can't leave halfway I've tried cold food and drink Perhaps I have a decayed tooth A decayed tooth will smell Oh no, it's intolerable I want to have it fixed Which tooth? This one The tooth here feels a little strange Open your mouth and let me see it You gave me a shock, who are you? I'm a dentist You must be kidding Sorry to interrupt you I overheard your conversation Conversation about your teeth A fresh and healthy topic Are you really a dentist? Then what are the reasons for toothache? Tooth is made up of such materials as enamel ...dentine and bone If there is an infection Pressure will build up as pus and gases are trapped Your nerves are then constricted causing pain in your tooth When you're warm blood circulation will make you feel acute pain Well it's really painful Although I don't quite understand, it sounds like the truth I'm a dentist Please come to my clinic when you need This is my name card I'm Yuka Toki. I've make an appointment at two o'clock Is this your first time here? Did you bring your insurance card? Yes, I did Please come with me Please come and sit here So I'm a really a dentist I don't know yet You can be a dentist or a quack... depending on your skills Certainly, I'm not a good dentist I'm self—willed I do badly if I don't like that patient But I can be good if I like her Come on, open your mouth What? Because we met in a disco It's better than knowing each other... through telephone hotline You have quite a lot of decayed teeth How long will it take to have them fixed? Around three months How many time I have to come each week? Once a week Only once a week? And lasts only for three months I'll be lonely if these are dates that I have Yes, you're right If you're my girlfriend I won't make you feel lonely Are you single? Yes Oh really? How about her? I thought she was your girlfriend Yes, she does have a crush on me but if we become a couple I'll have to spend more than I earn The X—ray of that patient has come out You can't do that This will cause misunderstanding among other patients I'm taking care of several patients at a time I have no other choice You say nothing about this at ordinary times I'm just carrying out my duties It is you who are talking in whispers Mind that You're impervious to reason The X—ray is here For a man who is used to ask about prices what he wants to know is not only the price of this painting but also the value of the women he comes across I don't want to be a man of this kind Sorry to have kept you waiting My boss thought I would be out for long How's work? Interesting? Very much interesting... so many weird people came around Last time a strange dentist came He talked about nothing but teeth Because I'm a dentist I said I wasn't going because it was too far away He asked me to come by taxi and he'd pay for it It's the first time I came across such thing Anyway, I think someone else will be willing to go I didn't accept his invitation in the end Such kind of people coming to the art gallery? Not here I worked in Ginza after finishing my job here I met him there You feel uncomfortable to say you work in a night club? It's nearly dark It'll look more like Ginza from now on Will you come? Not tonight... I'm sorry You have a date? In order to start a relationship with you I'll go and dump my girlfriend now Really? Just kidding I feel lonely at this moment You performance was marvellous I hope a pretty woman will say this to me The red car has gone... No date today My days of insomnia will continue! I'm like a detective who have several identities Don't be surprised! When I work as a dentist I have another identity, which is a Jazz musician When I'm a musician, I'm a dentist at the same time A solitary street makes me feel lonely I wait for some amorous experiences... something romantic and sexy Welcome Long time no see... What do you want? I don't know How about Gimlet? OK Tasty as usual I know what I want to drink now Really? What is it? Same After three glasses of Gimlet I have a feeling that something is going to happen There are two guys sitting with a pretty woman. They look familiar There is also a man I've never met I'm the detective today Taxi! Follow the taxi ahead OK Wow, thank you! Well... I want you to give these to... the guys at No.135 and 136 I got it Sir This is from No. 122 What? Is it Nagashima? What are you doing here? Do you know each other? Are you alone? Yes, I am This is the dentist who gave me 30000 yen as transport fee Forget it! You know Yuka? He is my my friend's brother I remember you have a beautiful sister Let me introduce This is Nagashima, my friend at university This is Shouku, medical equipment manufacturer And... My colleague, Yuri It seems that my insomnia can be cured I feel she is the one The woman who can make me fall asleep happily Both Yuri and Mr Ku heads for Shinagawa You two can take a taxi together Wait... This is the fare. See you. Bye. Goodnight. Be careful I'm sorry. I wanted to escort you home But we live so far away from each other... Thank you See you Please come to my clinic when you have time No need to make any appointment Good night Be careful Thank you Goodbye Will you come? Let me escort you home I don't want to sleep yet Taxi I wanted to see you, and then I really met you We wouldn't have met if the timing was bad We have to wait until next week before we can meet again Give our thank to the tasty Gimlet What? Want a beer after playing golf? Excellent! Go home alone makes me feel lonely Please It's very dark What? It's dark here You think so? The world has turned dark too Did anyone else come here? No man has come here before Very dark To make the world brighter I'm going to buy you something Go another day No, Christmas is near I don't like this I saw a convenience store somewhere near just now I want to give you a deeper impression upon my visit I'm going Light bulb... Light bulb? I have to go back quickly She will certainly be touched Thank you I came back quickly, didn't I? Yes, you did, very quickly I will turn off the light first OK Turn it on Wow, very bright Cheers! Cheers! It tastes good This beer makes the world brighter You want a shower? Yuka I've come only to have a drink You're not staying? If I did I would feel lonely when I wasn't with you later on You can move here and live with me Good night Hi libertine Hi playboy What... you followed us? I want to know how you drive her crazy You're stupid We both are This is a common problem among dentists We have our work done too early and have too much time at night Why isn't there any patient who has to come... in an ambulance because of a decayed tooth? We're so helpless You like Yuka? Yes. Why are you leaving so early? I got a strange feeling once I entered her house In fact I forgot to do some exercises When we're still studying at school, I started to wonder why you're so popular And now I know You're honest Very much different from your appearance Go home quickly. You still have to work tomorrow You're right Will I become popular if I learn to be a honest man, showing something different from my appearance? Good morning I don't know why There are a lot of new clients and all of them are young women Did you do anything? No, I didn't Perhaps it's because I'm skilful I wonder what kind of skill you mean Yes, Nagashima's clinic I'm sorry We're fully booked today Thank you If they are from Saidama, Chiba Refer them to the Kamiyama Hospital My friend at university... welcomes young female clients And he hates male clients a lot Such a sunny Sunday is annoying Hows work going to be? Wow, what a trendy car Whose car is it? Somebody's Don't scrawl on it This is not a parking area Please drive it away You're... I met you at the golf—course It must be someone else That car should have exceeded the parking time I'll go and have a look There're a few cars I have to check. Take your time A policewoman can take up part—time job? Those who obstruct the police in the course of their duty will be arrested It is said that patrolling in a pair... will have bonus credit Let's go somewhere and talk You have to forget my uniform look during the day I see no reason to stay with a girl who... denies she works at Ginza This is against the rule at Ginza I may lose my job because of this Against the rule? You can't approach the hostess... outside the night club Why is there such a silly rule? I can't agree with that I'll have a shower Don't judge anybody according to his appearance or job We should meet each other, naked Ruriko, I slept well last night My insomnia has been cured I don't want to hear anything like that Not in the morning You've already known what I wanted to say? Why? You've told me already No medicine can cure your insomnia Those who don't understand... what you mean are jerks Women have good memories But why aren't they interested in numbers? Are you talking to yourself? I've told you already Don't murmur to yourself when I'm present I asked Yuri if she's interested in music She said she likes orchestral music Especially Nini's trumpet Her interest is different from mine Better not to tell her too much about myself But to be frank, I want to sleep with her again tonight No, not tonight I'm sleepy No, you can't I don't understand what women think sometimes Let's chat a bit We're usually naked when we're together Are you satisfied? But it seems we don't understand each other well Let's talk more What is your interest? The art of sword Oh I see You've asked about that. No need to ask again You plan not to marry in your whole life? You've known it already? Marriage... The one you love can be different from the one you marry If possible, I want to be in love for the rest of my life You don't like kids? I want to put more time in educating myself You don't care even if no one cook and clean the house for you? I manage to do such things myself So I won't get married because of such considerations Great I hate cooking and cleaning I've been looking for someone like you for a long time Will you marry me? It seems to be a request from deep under the sea You didn't make such a decision because you want some memories, did you? I have had only a few memories of love affairs but those on my living are uncountable Love affairs in one's living is what I want Many people suicide because of love affairs in their living I've come to a conclusion You won't marry me I'll consider that Consider... I won't consider it! You're avoiding me You don't even answer my calls I'm waiting for you Bullshit! I better hang around with Kamiyama Go to hell. I don't care any more You sound like we've slept together That's what you wanted, right? You're right Then it makes no difference whether we've actually slept together or not I forgot whose saying it is Consciousness can exceed real experience Must be someone who works in an art gallery You have other things to do after work? Of course Shall we have a date? It is stressful to be a dentist I'm under pressure when I try to relax You're funny - I want to date you - You need not work at the night club? I quitted You're so happy when you heard it Hello, Yuka They said you've quitted your job Sorry, I didn't tell you about that No need to explain too much You must have found a boyfriend As your ex—customer, I congratulate you Congratulations, Nagashima Many young women have come to my clinic recently I'm so busy right now One of them has become my lifetime partner I just want to tell you this I will keep on Kamiyama... Don't worry I'll hang around with Yuri from now on Yuka, don't mind his words Please Kamiyama is a nice guy I admire him a lot I'll take you home Who are you really? There're so many surprises today You can play saxophone And this car... what? If I've killed somebody or I'm in fact a triad member you'll prefer dying, won't you? I'll be very disappointed You want to be the mistress of a gangster? I long for that I would be happy if the man I like... showed her all his strengths Tomorrow is Sunday. Any plan? To sleep all day long I don't have anything special to do on Sunday You'll spend the day alone? If I feel lonely, can I ask you out? Of course I'm not at home Please leave a message It is the 34th time My fingers are so tired Except that I'm mentally tired, it's in fact good for my body I'm not at home Please leave a message I have to imagine the girl right beside me... is the one whom I love most What are you thinking? Can you swim? No, I can't Oh really? Have a cup of tea Better if the drink is good for blood circulation But I only have this with me I see. Tea is good If bits of seaweed left between your teeth You aren't surprised, are you? I feel like a fool How come I brought with me such things Delicious Good that you've brought them with you Let's play cards You have them now? No, I just think it's the right thing to say now I want it today Hold me Sure Show the whole Tokyo how we hold each other Wait. I'm a bit nervous Yuka, what do you think about marriage Marriage? I haven't thought about it And I won't think about it in the next ten years I'll not get married... because I can't enjoy myself any more after getting married I won't consider it unless I become frustrated How about you? I've never thought of it before Let's clean our teeth together before we kiss Will you brush your teeth, dentist? No more seaweed. OK It's easy to be moved and cry A new patient has come A weird girl In fact, she is Yuri You recognise me just from my mouth? Do you miss me? I'm a dentist I called you many times this Saturday I went home Went home? My father's place You made me worried It's natural to meet someone as astonishing as you... in this way It's natural to meet in this way... You don't like this You look troubled I'm too happy that I feel troubled Wait What kind of arrangement is this? What arrangement? A time—clash I won't consider if she's your lover or not... when I make an appointment Sorry about that The client over there needs some more time Please wait for a while OK Let me have a look Where? Forget about the marriage I'm sorry for what I said that day I get tired of all those formalities As long as you're with me, nothing else matters to me Of course You don't have any decayed tooth I'll remove the tartar I wish I could give you a general anaesthetic I saw that in a movie Then the dentist could do whatever he wanted It is that movie that made me... decide to be a dentist There isn't any decayed tooth, really You want to say healthy teeth... is the result of an unhealthy body? You're clever Wait, I'll go check the other patient You can't say the same thing to her I wish I could give you a general anaesthetic A girlfriend who knows so well of what men think is sometimes laughable Sorry to have kept you waiting I was so happy last time Me too I want it everyday If the answer to my question is 'yes', give me paper If 'no', then rock You had a colleague called Yuri... when you worked in the night club The one who has an affair with Kamiyama... Does she like men? Does she have any regular customers? Someone bought her houses and land And of course clothes and cosmetics Someone did back her Not yet finished, need to mould your tooth Please wait for a moment Sorry to have kept you waiting I feel like I've turned into the chair... Now wash your teeth It is rumoured that someone wealthy is backing you If it's true, I'll have to call the police Is that true? Who said that? Am I like that kind of women? My family is rich My dad don't want me to idle so he let me work as a policewoman It's so annoying Is that what you said? You should check if it's true or not Make a phone call So what do you want with such a look on your face? I went on a short trip during weekend and took part in an overnight concert... at a Jazz bar in Miryoku It's an invaluable chance for me to think about... women... and marriage... What is my attitude? Let the saxophone tell me The concert is marvellous Especially your performance Thank you In a strange place I'm delighted when I receive praise like this It's time to go to bed? I can't sleep well these days I planned to buy some wine to drink You want to visit the Morning Market? You should go when you're in Miryoku Delicious There is no exciting life here I saw a picture of Tokyo in a magazine What a pity Perhaps it's too excited, I've become apathetic I want that kind of excitement in apathy Mr. Nagashima, I want to go to Tokyo I think you're the one who has come to bring me there Then let's go and have a look Come back when you become tired of it I will go with you Please bring some changes to me Your expectation will make me feel troubled My name is Nagashima, not Tokyo Please make me change A woman will change no matter... she is with a good guy or a bad guy Only those whose boyfriends... are lacking in perseverance won't change The Tokyo Tower is beautiful Shall we go to the disco? But I dress like this... Come on, I'll buy you some new clothes One day What? In only one day, I've become a fashionable woman See, that's Nagashima's car There're many freaks in Tokyo, right? That's true How is it? Avery nice house These days when I was looking for a house I was scouted by at lease ten people For what? To work as model, hostess or in Lovers' Club Then? I believe among those who approached me... there're someone trustworthy I'm now confident in living in Tokyo At least there're someone who will strike up a conversation with me Of course everyone wants to talk to a girl like you And I talked only to you Because it's you who brought me to Tokyo It is a serious responsibility So please stay here tonight You aim at living in Tokyo And now you've grown maturer Today is the memorial day of this house I won't demand you to be with me tomorrow and the day after tomorrow I just want a memory before I leave This is not my first time Don't worry I'm leaving If I can't sleep alone It's meaningless to come to Tokyo People are a bit too cool here But it is what Tokyo is The more beautiful you think it is the cooler you will find it later It has become the task of adults living in this cosmopolite city... to tell the truth to others Are you alright? A double date is great, isn't it? It won't become a weird habit, right? Both of them are pretty Who is the woman in your car last time? Who is she? Nagashima is not getting married He won't be tied down by a woman It doesn't matter if we keep on like this Although it's disagreeable it's still better than losing you and suffering from loneliness So we have no other choice but to accept it Both Yuka and I think in this way You can fell in love with us at the same time It doesn't matter even if you have a third girlfriend But you can't make a favourite of any of us If you have only six hours for dating Each of us will have two hours A three—day holiday will also be shared out equally Christmas and New Year will be divided... into three sessions: morning, afternoon and night One can enjoy a whole day on her birthday We'll share your time equally in this way It'll be difficult if I have 13 girlfriends Go to hell! It's possible if I'm single But in fact, I'm not I've never invited you to come to my house I've in fact a wife and three children I'm such a bad guy. I'm sorry Why did you lie? You couldn't have had any children I like you a lot I don't want to break up with you Ok, I'll bring you to my house Please come this Sunday I'll go Where are they? My wife Keiko They're my eldest and second eldest sons He is Sanro, my youngest son They're my girlfriends, Yuka and Yuri Thank you for taking care of my husband The dishes are ready Yes Yes Mrs Nagashima, are you living in bliss? Yes You're so happy We want to share your happiness Welcome to my house anytime You're welcome even if your teeth are healthy I made all of the dishes Are they delicious? Yes, honey It's now a hot topic A man who plays sax also plays tricks A bad guy who is a dentist during the day If it's published on magazines It'll certainly become a talking point Thank you I thank you too I'm eager to see how he can cope with it Really? Shall I put it as headline news It'll be over if I say It's OK, right? You don't want to say that, do you? Ok, no one will know it's a false tooth You don't need me any more But we're still friends Don't forget to call me I love you no matter what you've done See you! Take care Goodbye Welcome back You want a shower or have dinner first Which one? You're not going home? I have got used to living here After all, this is a man's house People will talk at your back You won't like a girl who cares such things I'm afraid of loneliness I hate moving here and there I'll stay here Let's get married After all, I've pretended to be your wife I'll give you the rest of my life Tokyo She finally spoke of marriage And she knows where I live What to do? What are you thinking? Keiko, I have to leave Tokyo To where? I'll go to a Third World country... and give dental care to the refugees there I'll work there for at least five years You won't say I'll go with you I'll go with you You said you'd be transferred to Chicago, right? I'll have to sell this house And close the clinic Did you make up your mind suddenly? I wanted to tell you about this a long time ago But I couldn't Originally I decided to leave without telling you this That's cruel! Keiko, you're still young But you hang around only with me You can't see me as the best guy in this world Make a conclusion after you've gone out with at least ten guys I've had over 16 boyfriends Really? Just kidding What else do you need? Yes... what do I need? Good that I can choose the wine myself Thank you I won't come in the near future Travel? Not willingly Come back quickly I'll make you some new cocktails I look forward to that I'll drink one more cup and then go home I got it After a cup of cocktail I walk on the street and start a new story I look forward to coming here again I come to my sister's house I come here whenever I'm upset It would be great if every woman was my sister You're murmuring again Why don't you ask me to help dump your girlfriends? In order to save a ring you have to close your clinic now Yes It'd be much better if I ask for your help You shouldn't regret it now Or you'll end up with a decayed tooth Cheers! I envy you. You're always my sister You're always my brother too. I'll follow you everywhere Thank God I don't believe in God Cheers! It's time to go Keiko, take care Be a even more attractive woman... when I come back next time Understand? He has really left? He gave you a goodbye kiss? If there's anything wrong with your teeth I'll take care of that Don't worry After this six—day trip to Guam what are we going to do? I haven't made up my mind yet I can live anywhere with my skills You have no idea where you'll work at? Leave it for the sunshine and sea of Guam to decide Who do you love most then? I'm not telling you
