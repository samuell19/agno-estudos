[music playing] FEMALE: Oh my god. There's two. -Two? FEMALE: Two. IRENE: Two what? Two heads? FEMALE: No. Two boys. Two perfect baby boys. -They're so beautiful. -Which one came out first? -This one. -He's Byron. The other one-- we'll call the other one Brian. Well done, Irene. -With the Leaves this past week Brian Spencer, and Brian since joining the team, looks like you've come to play. -Oh, that's what I had to-- had in mind when I came up. -Brian, when they came up to you did they say they wanted you to do some thumping, hard hitting? -Uh, not really, but it always turns out that way. This is my style of hockey. -That's your style of game, right. -The biggest fear I've ever had is a fear of failing. Any kind of failing. Failing at school. Failing in human relationships. Or failing on the ice. The fear of being judged incompetent in your team and as a team. The fear of someone thinking that you were broken down and crippled. Of not being able to do it on your own. Fear of getting lost somewhere and being afraid of being lost. The fear of being afraid. But fear isn't a bad thing, you know. If you use it right it can be a real help to an ambitious person. -Hockey is God's game. He invented it. So you can bet it's complex. You've got to be thinking 360 degrees all the time. The only guy that's got more angles to worry about is a fighter pilot. Gotta have eyes in the back of your head so you could feel the whole rink. Because when you're in along the boards you're going to get hammered. But if you can feel the hit coming, you can dust it off. Follow? OK. Byron, I-- I want you here. Brian, go to the far end of the boards, turn around, skate full tilt, hit your brother with everything you got. OK, let's do it. -Ow. -Come on, Byron, none of that. Again. -Again. -What's your problem? -I can't, sir. -OK. Fair enough. And I think you should skate figure eights. -How many sir? -Until I say. -He took me imple-- -Implement. -Daddy. -You angry? -Yes, sir. -Good. Take a run at me. Control your fear. Learn to use it. It'll become your best friend. You follow me? -Yes, sir. -Go get your brother. This guy was a drunk. He was killed in car accident when he was 33. This guy told everyone he was going to do it and he finally did. He put a 10 gauge shotgun in his mouth and he blew the back of his head off. This was a no good son of a bitch. Someone finally shot him. They called it murder but it should have been done a long time ago. This is it. Life at the fort. You could live here and be buried here or you can play hockey. -Good morning, Byron. -Good morning, sir. -I can't tell dad. That's the fourth time this month. He'd kill us. -We'll get by. Let's go. -They say you'll have to go to reform school. Now, when you get out, they don't want you at the house, Brian. You'll have to go somewheres else to live. I don't understand any of this. What was going through your mind? And I wouldn't have-- What are we going to do, boys? -We're going to play hockey, dad. -You promise me? -Yeah, I promise. -You can say what you like about the dad, but what you have to understand is he had this condition, and it was like a poison. Every once in a while it made him crazy. But it's not like he was crazy normally. But if this uremia thing was acting up, he'd kind of-- he'd lose it. And it was during the war he picked up this condition. He was an engineer. Been around the death camps and everything. Anyway, it was during the war he developed this uremia thing. So whenever he went off the rails, it wasn't him exactly. It was this uremia thing. -What is that place up there? -Regina. Where you headed? Regina? -Well, that's the place. You got family there? -No sir, I don't. I'm going there to play hockey for the Regina Pats. -Wow. Then it's a privilege to meet ya. Hope we see ya in the NHL some day. -Oh, you can count on that, sir. Hey, I could give you an autograph right now and save you the trouble of tracking me down later. Hey, just out of curiosity, how many people live in Regina? -Oh, about 110,000, 120,000. -All in one place. -He's got grit. -Yeah, he got that. Not so sure about his depth perception. -Hey, you guys. We gotta stop here. We gotta stop and marvel at the one and only mister perfect deltoid Spencer. No kidding, big Bri, you got us all trembling. -Bugger up, [inaudible]. -Bugger. What a revealing choice of words. Which way to the beach, young swaine. Yeah. -Spencer, what is your problem? -My problem? -You're all right, Greg. Spencer, if you've got a brain inside that skull of yours, why don't you do us all a favor and use it. -Sir, he was accusing me of-- -He called you a couple of names and you jump the guy? I swear to god, in all the years I've been in this game, I have never run across a dumber hockey player than you, Spencer. -Mr. Monroe. I've been in the bush working like a man since I was 10 years old with log camps and lumber mills. You don't talk to me like a-- I'm some little city boy who forgot to bring your paper home. -Well, I got news for you, bushman. You're off the team, effective immediately. Clean out your locker. -[inaudible]. -Spencer! -Spencer! -Hey Spencer! -What? -You better go home. There's been some kind of an emergency! -What? What's going on? -Brian, sit down. -Come on. What is this. -I said sit down. I'm going to read you something. "Dear Brian. During the recent amateur draft meetings in Montreal, we acquired the exclusive rights to put you on our negotiating list and we're prepared to negotiate a contract with you personally for your professional services to the Toronto Maple Leaves for the 1969, '70 season, and thereafter." -You're going to be in National Hockey League, Brian. -That's the top of the mountain, buddy. You made it to the top of the mountain. We made it, son. Congratulations. -Woo! -Hope all your blades are sharp, your legs are hungry, you're feeling mean. There's a lot of you here, and nobody's job is secure. -Skip the intros, John. Let's skate. -For those of you that haven't met him, our team captain, Mr. Davy Keon, and that sounds like a good idea. All right. Two intersecting lines, let's go. -Hockey night in Canada. -Welcome to hockey night in Canada. From Maple Leaf Garden, the Chicago Black Hawks versus the Toronto Maple Leaves. Hello, everyone. Ward Kernel here. The Black Hawk lead season series is tied at two games a piece, typical of the closeness of play between these two great teams, and tonight's game should be another good one. HOCKEY ANNOUNCER: [inaudible] brings it out. going down with Bobbie Hoe, one man back. And the puck goes behind as [inaudible] got back very quickly. Brian Spencer coming out of his own zone to center. He goes to the boards [inaudible]. Spencer, coming over here to [inaudible] and they're taking the line trying to get a shot away. Spencer had him covered. Took him to the board. Wrapped it back for Spencer. He and Magnuson bump together. -Try that again, I'll kill ya. -Magnuson's dirty and sick. Don't be afraid of him. HOCKEY ANNOUNCER: Dennis Hull on the left wing and number 20 is Flip Coral. Up the center ice for Magnuson. Magnuson may have objected to being hit by Spencer. [inaudible] Spencer [inaudible] breaks it up. Magnuson took a run at Spencer. Spencer now gets up on his feet. [inaudible] Now then the two linesmen decide to move in. Magnuson still wants some more action. REFEREE: Toronto penalty for number 15, Spencer, two minutes for roughing. The time, 6:28. -There's a whole lot of ways of going through this life casually, but I never did. I never found those ways. I never have been much of a casual person. I'm a hockey player, almost genetically violent. Playing a violent sport, sitting on a powder keg all of the time. When I hate, I hate. When I love, I love. That's what life's all about on the ice. You protect your goalie, you protect your scores. It's like family. And if anyone crosses that line, you've been violated. Then all of a sudden you're not playing a game. No one's sitting in the stands. No one's watching on TV. You're on the ice with one thing in your mind. You're going to find the guy who crossed that line and you're going to do him some serious damage. -All right, everybody, let's go. -Brian! That thing with Magnuson tonight, that was good work. -Thank you, sir. HOCKEY ANNOUNCER: Around to Daryl Sitler. Sitler gets the puck out. He and Spencer with one man back. Sitler over the line. Closes in, takes the shot and he missed the target. -Give me some [inaudible]. -Come on, talk to me. Does it feel bad? -No, it feels good. -Like good bad? -No, like good good. Like jesus, can that guy hit. -Got your breath back? -Yeah, I'm fine. -You're in for Oman. Go. Go in! HOCKEY ANNOUNCER: And Spencer trying to come out in front still has it. Fights for it along the board. Right front to Sitler. Here's Spencer, [inaudible] score! His first NHL goal! Brian Spencer gets his first NHL goal and [inaudible] picks the puck up for him. -Roy! There's plaster dust falling all over the sofa. -You tend to get that when you drill a hole in the roof, Irene. You tend to get that. -Do you have to do it now? -I want clear reception for the game tonight. This thing guarantees perfect reception. Now, go on. Get back in the house, Irene. You OK? -For god's sake, Roy. -Linda, come on. Stop with the crowbar. I've got a game. -A game? And your wife's about to give birth! -I-- I'm on hockey night in Canada! -I'm dialated four centimeters already! -What do you want out of me? I called the ambulance. -I want you to come to the hospital! -I'm the intermission guest! You get it? The intermission guest! -You are so sick! -I'm sick? You're a lunatic! -Don't get in that car, Brian! -What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? -All right. We're in the second intermission, then the commercial run, the logo, and then you go straight to Ward for the interview with-- Who's the interview with tonight? -Uh, Brian Spencer. -OK, then through the interview and then into second commercial. -Oh my god! Hey Jimmy! Guess what? I'm a father, man! Linda just had a baby girl! -She what? -She's got hair? She's got hair! Blonde hair! What? You're kidding me. Hey, she came out with her eyes open. Listen, uh, hey, Jimmy, you mind clearing out? I've gotta say something here. Listen, ah, Linda, first off, I'm sorry for not being there. But I'm such a bull I'd probably just bust something. And, ah, second, I think you're amazing. I know I don't tell you that enough. Probably because I'm primal or something. But, uh, I love you, OK? FILM PERSON: Back check, camera one. Just a little out of focus. -Yeah, mom. Yeah! No, no, no, no. Nine pounds. Just like a beanbag chair or something. Ah, yeah, she's fine. But listen, listen. You know I'm on tonight. Oh yeah? You all set? OK. I'm playing for you tonight. You tell dad that. OK. Yeah. -Brian! Brian! -Woo! HOCKEY ANNOUNCER: Brian Spencer trying to center it. Trying to get it back, he does. Mike Pellock raps it back for Spencer. And Magnuson [inaudible]. And comes back to Pellock. There's a shot right in front of the net. Now we have Spencer and Magnuson, fighting with Spencer. -I understand that some of the your teammates have taken to calling you Spinner Spencer. Why is that? -Well, I guess on a-- account of my skating style. You see, I never seen a sense of skating around someone when you can just go through them. -Thank you very much, Brian. And I'm sure your family is watching tonight and they're very proud of you. Hockey night in Canada continues in just a moment. -Uh, Mr. Spencer. -Yes. -Can we talk to you for a second? -Yeah, sure. What about? -I'm very sorry, but it would seem that your father has been in an accident. -Spinner, when did you hear your father has been shot? -Come on. Have a heart. Back off. Give him room. -You gonna give him some time off? HOCKEY ANNOUNCER: A [inaudible], Brian Spencer. -My father, Roy Edward Spencer, was a very kind, generous, warm-hearted man. Yup. Sad. Because of the fact that the very country for which he fought and lost his good health let him down. I want to repeat the last thing I ever got from my dad. It's a telegram sent the night he died. "Give 'em hell, son. We are mighty proud." We are mighty proud." We are mighty proud." -Hey, Brian. Are you deaf? Can't you hear her screaming? -Yeah, I could hear. What am I supposed to do? I don't know what to do. -We should go. OK. OK. OK. OK. Are you ready to go? [loud music playing] -Hey, turn down the radio! -What is with these jerks. -Brian, please. -Don't. don't. Let's just see what this guy's gonna do. -Brian. -I don't believe this! Hey moron! Turn down the radio. You're scaring my baby! -Brian! Brian! -Hey! -Brian! Brian! Stop it! Brian, don't do this! Brian! Brian! Brian! What's wrong with you? -I wanna go home. -Did you like it? -It was delicious. -Do you want anything else? -A snooze. HOCKEY ANNOUNCER: [inaudible] is back for it. He shot it right out of Henderson's stick. Henderson-- and the [inaudible] score! And the shot is [inaudible] at the top. He's right in front of the net. Spencer shoots. [inaudible] score! Spencer gets his second in a row. [inaudible] Spencer, Spencer shoots. That's the hat trick. NEWS ANNOUNCER: [inaudible] he was going for that puck from Rickie Lee about five seconds before it came, and that is a big thrill for Brian Spencer, I'm sure. A hat trick in his very first year in the NHL. HOCKEY ANNOUNCER: Goal scored by number 15, Spencer. -I proclaim you the honorary mayor of Fort St. James! -What's the book on Murray? He never changes. He's like the same person he was seven years ago. -He just gets weirder. -Is anybody hungry? -Geez, ma, we just ate. -Oh, Brian, can we talk? -Yeah. -You can go to hockey school or Timbuktu for all I care. The fact is you're leaving me here with your mother-- -So you don't like my mother. -I love your mother. That's not the point. -Well, what is the point? -The point is you're going away for three weeks and you're only giving me $50. -Oh. This is all about money. -What's the problem? -50 bucks is a lot of money. What are you planning on spending it on? -Bottles, diapers, food. What do you think? Well, what am I supposed to do if I run out? -I don't know. Return pop bottles. -Brian, this is your family. -You're crowbarring, Linda. Don't crowbar in on me. -Stop being so stupid! -What do you call me? -Stupid. You're being stupid. -Don't call me stupid, Linda. -What do you want me to call it when you're being stupid? Brian. Brian! Come back! [MUSIC - MOTLEY CRUE, "SMOKIN' IN THE BOYS ROOM] -Can anybody up there tell me what the story is with women? I mean how do they do it? I've been bankrupted by them. Had my career shortened. Been ruined by them, but I still love them. They just got this way of crowbarring in on you, and I'm not being sarcastic. I remember this one time I was playing in Buffalo-- I forget who it was against. But I took this canon of a slapshot, and it buckshot straight up the skirt of some lady sitting in a stands. to this day, I swear to God it's a freak of nature she didn't get pregnant. -Uh, I'm thinking I might pack it in. -Pack in what? -The booze. -Me too. I am Brian Frigging Spencer! -Well, I am a brother of Brian Frigging Spencer! -And I play left wing for the Toronto Maple Leaves! -I am the brother of the man who plays left wing for the Toronto Maple Leaves! -Woo! -You're too late. -Too late for what? Too late for what, Mom? What are you saying? -She's left you, Brian. [MUSIC - TOMMY HUNTER, "TRAVELLIN MAN] -Good night, everybody. Hello, Bill. -Good night, Tommy. The Tommy Hunter show. TV ANNOUNCER: Coming up later on CDC, hockey night in Canada. Most of the country will see the game between the Toronto Maple Leaves and the Chicago Black Hawks. While veiwers in British Columbia will see the California Seals against the Vancouver Canucks. -They're not going to show Brian's game. [MUSIC - THE GUESS WHO, "AMERICAN WOMAN"] -Let's get the ground rules straight, OK? I'm not into the domestics, the rituals, the barbeques. They're not for me. I'm a dangerous left winger who's faster than a speeding bullets, and I leap away from alimony payments in a single bound. So don't even think of crowbarring on me. -Who are you? -I'm a hockey player. -Oh, that's too bad. -Why? -Because I hate hockey players. -You know, when I stop to think about it, to really analyze it, I think I'd be safe to say that I've always been sort of out of culture kind of person. I don't mean I don't read or anything-- I've always got a good book around, Generals mostly-- Hitler, Patton, that kind of thing. What I really mean about this out of culture kind of thing is that it always seemed like I was unprepared or something. I never saw a television set until I was 16. I didn't eat Chinese food until I was 20. And the first NHL game I ever really saw was the one I played in. I've always been from somewhere else. Out of culture. -OK, you ready? -Yeah, sure. -Now don't be casual about this, Ricky. I've been working on this baby for over a year now. I sunk 40 grand into it. You're the first person I'm showing it to. -Hey, I'm honored, OK? So show me. -Brace yourself. My mobile command center! -Oh my god! -I took a Dodge van, I welded it on to a three and a half ton, for a total of 16 tons. Top speed 61 miles an hour. -Gee. -Now look in here! Look in here! You see that? -Wow. -That's a DC-3 cockpit in there. 200 gauges, all functional. Check this out! Fully decked out. Rich, waterbed, wet bar, but there's more. Three TV systems, a two-way radio. Can you see that? -What? -You see it? -What? -Come here. See that machine gun? -Machine gun. -That's a 20 caliber, demilitarized. And I converted it into a video intercom system for surveillance. -Oh, man. -I've got everything in here a guy could want, Ricky. -Oh, man. -You look underneath this baby. See the drivetrain? You see power. You see me. -Man, oh man. Has it, uh, got a name? -The hulk. RADIO ANNOUNCER: You know, Brian Spencer's probably on his way to the rink right now for the game tonight, and let's hope he gets in there to win one for us. And you know what, I know one of Brian's favorite songs by the Bellamy Brothers. So for Spinner Spencer heading to the rink, here's to you, bud. [MUSIC - BELLAMY BROTHERS, "LET YOUR LOVE FLOW"] HOCKEY ANNOUNCER: Into the corner to [inaudible]. Goal! Brian Spencer! Brian Spencer! Oh boy! And it's [inaudible] 6. Spencer throws the [inaudible]. -Oh, god. -Did you win? -Yeah. Terry Harper hit me so hard, he rearranged all my teeth. He's a jippy little bastard. He keeps it up, one of these days I'll get two minutes for man slaughter. How's the kid? -He's an angel. Brian, are you just gonna leave your clothes on the floor like that? -Janet, try to think practical. You do it this way, you get up in the morning, everything's laid out in front of you, and you just put them back on the way you drop 'em. I know what you're thinking. -Oh, you do, huh? -You're thinking of getting up before I do and picking everything up, I know. -Is that what you think I'm thinking? Brian! You broke the bed! Brian! Stop it! Stop it! Because you're gonna wake up Jason! -He's got to learn that sooner or later! Good night, Janet. -Good night, Brian. NEWS ANNOUNCER: The Buffalo Sabers announced a deal today that would send a local favorite, Spinner Spencer, to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for some junior prospects. Brian Spencer will be sorely missed by Buffalo fans. He's provided a lot of hockey entertainment over the last little while. -Penguins.

Settle down. -You lose again? -Yeah. -Need back rub? -No. Where's your mom? -She went out. -She didn't leave a note or anything? -Hey, Spinner. Come on in. Sit down. Have a seat. I'm, uh, I'm glad you dropped by actually. I was-- I was thinking in the last little while that we should get together. You know have a night. So, how's your lovely wife? Janet, isn't it? -How much do these boxes cost you. Hundred grand? -Something like that. -So that would kind of make you like Rockefeller of Pittsburgh, huh? -Well, not exactly, Brian. -I know, you know. I mean I know what's going on. -What do you mean? I don't know what you mean. [recorder playback] ON RECORDER (MALE): Hi. It's me. ON RECORDER (JANET): Oh hi. Hi. ON RECORDER (MALE): How you doing? ON RECORDER (FEMALE): I'm fine. Uh, listen, I, uh, I can't talk with you right now. Um-- ON RECORDER (MALE): Why not? ON RECORDER (FEMALE): Well, Brian's downstairs and, uh, I don't think that-- ON RECORDER (MALE): Why? What's he doing? -It's not what it sounds like, Brian. -You're afraid of me, aren't ya? -What are you going to do? -I'm not sure. I just came in here. I kind of wanted to drill ya. But now I don't know. Now that I'm here, I think maybe it's just enough. -Don't want your face [inaudible]. -(ANGRY) You just don't get it, do you? I wouldn't have an affair on you, Brian. And you want to know why? Because it would only make you feel virtuous, and I am not going to give you that! But I'll make you a promise, OK? If I ever do have an affair on you, you'll be the first to find out because I'll leave you before it starts! -Are you walking out on me, Janet? -Oh don't be so stupid! -You calling me stupid? -You got a different word for it? -Don't. You realize I could kill you right now. Don't you realize I could kill you right now, Janet? -[inaudible], Brian? You gonna hit me? -Don't push me. -Oh, come on, hit me! Come on, hit me! Hit me, Brian! Hit me! -[inaudible]. [hockey announcer] The Chicago Bulls, [inaudible]. -That's great. That's great. Now tell me, how does this team stack up against the others you've played on? -Ah but-- now, I think that the-- look. The whole problem with this club in the name. A team's name should have strength, courage, like colts or tigers. But what do we got? -Penguins. -Penguins! Penguins! Incompetent little birds. They can't even-- can't even fly! Just waddle! -[inaudible]. -Hey, Jason. Cut it out, OK? Can you take, ah, Jerrod out into the living room? Gotta talk with mom. -Dad. -Don't argue with me. -Here you go. You've been traded. -Worse. I've been sent down to the minors. Binghamton Dusters. 27 years old and I'm disposable. -I can't do this anymore. -What are you saying? -I'm saying I can't do this anymore. -Hey, Spence, where the hell are you going? You walking out? You walk out on this team, you walk out on hockey for good! -I read this thing once written by a professor at some university. It's called the retirement of professional hockey players. A process of change in career identity. Listen to this. If a player is limited in his knowledge of the outside world, and if a strong hockey identification is carried to the extreme, a player's perception of his own success and failure as a person may become one in the same with the course and outcome of his hockey career. This has ominous overtones, particularly for those who are not successful. Wild, huh? [music - santana, "oye como va"] -Hey, Brian! After the morning shift, we've got a receptionist needs her car looked at. You mind doing this? -A woman? -Yeah. -Say no more. -So am I gonna need a new engine or something? -I doubt it. It's just your U joint. -My U joint? -Yeah. So your differential's-- -My differential's what? -Hey, you still got that beer you promised? -Uh-huh. -Well, hand it to my feet. -Oh. So, uh, can I get under there? -Why? -Well, I don't know anything much about cars. I was thinking maybe you could, uh, you know, show me what you're doing or something. -Well, it's awful dirty under here. -Oh yeah? -Hey, Diane! Honey! -I'm under the car, pooch! -What you doing under there, baby? -Well, Brian here is giving me a crash course in automotive technology. -Right on. So what's the trouble? -Well, it seems it's my, uh, U joint. -So what's it gonna cost us, Brian? -Oh, it isn't gonna cost us anything, honey. Sometimes these old U joints just slip right out of position, and all you gotta do is tighten them a little. -I really appreciate this Brian, buddy. I really do. [music - santana, "oye como va"] -What y'all doin? -Movies, baby. -You're gonna film it? -You're in the hulk now, baby. -You gave this thing a name? -Hey. Don't laugh at the hulk, babe. It's [inaudible]. It's a way of life. Let me look at the drivetrain on this baby. You are looking at power. You're looking at me. -Um-hmm. -So, why don't you come over here, and sit on my beak. -Oh. Power. [music - santana, "oye como va"] -Good to see ya. -Hey. Breathe, OK? What do you smell? -Diesel. -No, man. Breathe. That's salt. Salt! That's the ocean! No snow! 82 degrees in the shade. -So what's this woman like? -Who? Diane? -No, Marie Osmond. -Ah, Diane. Ah, she's all right. Hey, do you mind doing me a favor and hang out with her while I'm working. -Keep her out of trouble? -Good luck. -So what's the book on it. Long term kind of deal? -I don't know. She's kind of like a stray I took in. Mostly we're together because it reduces expenses, eh. But, uh, we come and go as we please. -Yeah, right. Like Janet, Linda, and god knows else before that. -Hey, at least I didn't marry this one. Woo! [MUSIC - THE BELLAMY BROTHERS, "LET YOUR LOVE FLOW"] -Let your love flow like a mountain stream. Let your love go with the smallest of things, and let your love show, and you know what I mean-- -Welp, what do you think? -Looks like Fort St. James. -Hey, Dan. Come see what the Spin dragged home! -Byron? -Yeah. -Hi there. I'm Diane Delana. -Mid City. [music playing] -So what is it y'all do up there in Canada? -Oh, you know, this and that. Logging mostly. -Uh-huh. Were you a hockey player too? -No. I'm the useless one in the equation. -You gonna be OK here? -Sure. -I shouldn't be too long. I don't know, maybe half hour or so. -No problem. POLICE: Get over here right now! [inaudible] MAN: I'm not doing nothing. POLICE: Back off. MAN: Don't touch me. POLICE: Back off! MAN: [inaudible]. Let go! -You wanna mess with me? -Let go! -Get down. -You want some more of that? Shutup! You're coming with me. -Hey, where's Diane? -I don't know. -It's her car, isn't it? Isn't it? -Yeah. -Isn't this her car? -Yeah. It's her car. -Well, then where is she? -I don't know. She went in there. -Michael! Get over here! -Where the hell did you go? Who is this jerk? Where have you been? -I don't know what you're talking. Brian's brother. -Oh, who's he, another hockey player. You've been jerking me around. -I have not been jerking you around. You know there are boundaries here and my boundaries-- -There are no boundaries here, sweetheart. -Don't you-- -Diane! Diane! -That was a pretty short meeting. -Sometimes they're short. Sometimes they're long. -Listen, I'm not kidding, Brian. I've got it all worked out. And I'm talking big money, not penny anty shit. Check this out. In seven days I felled, skidded, bucked and loaded enough wood to make 25 grand. I used Roy Willock's loader. Paid with a credit of gravel. It costs four bucks a unit, 50 bucks a load. So at 30 loads I owed Roy 1,500 bucks. Gravel comes to two bucks a yard. So I owed Roy 750 yards of gravel. He might not need the gravel for a year or so. My only real expense was the trucking. At five bucks a unit, 75 a load, and 30 loads, that's what, 2,200, plus a grand for fuel and miscellaneous. So for seven days after expenses I made about $20,000. With two hands we could double that easy. -Hey bud. -What? -Can we do this in the morning? -Yeah, OK. Whatever. -Come on, just stop it. Get off her. [BRIAN AND DIANE ARGUING IN BACKGROUND] NEWS ANNOUNCER: The police have identified the body found yesterday on PGA Boulevard as that of Michael Dalfo, a 32-year-old Florida real estate salesman.

Can't you understand that? -I love you, Brian. -I don't care if you love a rat's ass. -Well, doesn't it mean anything to you? -You're like-- you're like a straight jacket. I can't breath! -Don't you love me? -[inaudible], Diane. You're [inaudible]. -Oh, Brian! [glass breaking] [punching wall] He loves me. He really does love me. He just don't know it yet. -You want some free advice? Time to move on. -Why don't you just go back to Canada! -You're dangerous. -What's this? -I bought you a ticket. Why don't you come home with me? -How can I come back? -Easy. Just go through that door with me right now. -What about all my stuff? -Forget it. Just step on the bus and we're on our way. -How could I do that? -Just watch me. I'll show you. -I can't. -I'll see you later. I love you. [music playing] -It's weird how things work out, isn't it? I mean like I was sitting on this beach in Florida one time. I must have been, oh, I don't know, 37, 38, somewhere in there. Anyway, this tire washed up on the beach. It was kind of bashed up, but it was a tire, an old radial. And I was kind of stunned. I was eating a hot dot at that time, and I remember just putting the hot dot down in the sand and looking at this tire. Where did it come from? It could have come from Hawaii maybe or Siberia. And then it hit me like a ton of bricks. It could have come from Fort St. James for all I know. It could have been a tire off one of my old cars. -Taxi. -Yes, sir. -Hey, if you got money for a cab, how about a few bucks for using my washroom as a hotel? -Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's all under control. -[inaudible]. -Hey buddy, where you going? I said I'm on Skis Road. -What's going on, man. What is this? -Brian Roy Spencer, I'm placing you-- -Brian Roy Spencer, you are under arrest. You are surrounded. Give yourself up. Put your hands over your head. I repeat. You are surrounded. Put your hands over your head! -All right, let's try it again. Brian Roy Spencer I place you under arrest for the kidnapping and first degree murder of Michael J. Dalfo. You have the right to remain silent. -Your parole, huh? -Hell, I wish. I put in one year in the miners, baseball, but I got a rotator cuff thing. It never went away. So who'all you play for? -Leaves, Islanders, Sabers, Pittsburgh. -Well, we got an altogether different kind of penalty down here in the Sunshine State. We call it old smokey. -Mr. Spencer. -Hi. -I'm Dick Green. I'm the assistant public defender. -Sir. -This is Dion Wright. He's the chief assistant. -Pleased to meet you, sir. -Listen, why don't you pull up one of these beautiful chairs, courtesy of Palm Beach County Detention. So, how you doing? -Could be worse. Could be playing for Pittsburgh still. -Hang on to your sense of humor, Mr. Spencer. You're going to need it before we're finished here. Uh, the political climate is, um-- well, let's just say it's not a great time to be white for murder one. -What do you mean? -It means they like to fry people down here. For the most part there's been a string of black cons. But the pressure's on the court to cook up some white people-- even the score. -Great. -OK. Well, let's take this one step at a time. You have been charged under Federal Statute 62.3, one count murder in the first degree. Now, you're alleged to have committed this murder five years ago in the early morning hours of February 4, 1982, 3:00, 4:00 AM, somewhere in there. -Now, around 10:00 AM that morning we got a Albert Brin, or Brine-- Brin, I guess. Any case he's a trucker. He's hauling a load of sludge west on PGA Boulevard. He looks off to his left and 50 feet into the clearing was-- Forensics determined that the weapon of choice is likely a handgun, 25 caliber fired at contact range. Paramedics take the body to Palm Beach Gardens Community where he's pronounced dead at 3:36 that afternoon and identified as one Michael J. Dalfo, real estate agent. -You ever own a handgun? -Yes, sir. -A 25? -Come on. That's a purse gun. I had a 22 when I was a kid, but I wouldn't own one now. -Did you know this Dalfo character? -No. -Prosecution says that you did. -According to who? -According to the woman you lived with at the time, Diane Delana. She's married now with a couple of kids. Did you know that? -Yeah. Went to the wedding. Can you believe that? -One small point here. In order for you to make bail, the court's going to know that you got somewhere to live. Now, is that a problem for you? -Nope. My girlfriend's got a place over in Springfield. -That would be Monica Jarobe? -So ice hockey in Florida, huh? -Sure. I-- Why not? It's, uh, it's a fast fighting sport. -Well, no. I-- I'm not cynical or anything. I just think that people who've been raised on football and basketball and baseball probably are going to find a hard time getting into those sports that's played on ice. Um, I know there's a lot of Canadians that will be thinking of home and they'll be happy to see it, because that's what your major audience is probably going to be. -Not at all-- -I went around the trailer the other day and some kids or something had got it. It's been torn to pieces. -What about the hulk? -Yeah, that too. It's wrecked. -(WHISPER) What's happening to the world? There's no respect for anything. That was like-- it's five years I've been living here. -Nice. Nice. Spin around and let's see your butt. Woo! Yeah, Di, beautiful. Woo! Yeah, you'll do. You'll do just fine. Come on, [inaudible]. -No, thank you. -You'll do just fine. Do y'all want a line? OK, I see. Business, business. Let's get to it! I think you know what I want. It's right there between the cheeks, and I don't mean the cheeks on your face! Ah, yeah, let's look at the mouth. Oh, nice lips. Full-bodied lips. Keep the lips, but no teeth, OK? [inaudible], you know [inaudible]. -When I got there, he was, uh, doing all that coke. -Who was doing all that coke? -Michael Dalfo. -Now, you attempted to perform oral sex for him, but he was unable to sustain an erection. Is that correct? -Yes. -After this little part, he wanted you to take a shower with him, is that right? -Yes. -But you refused. -Yes. -Why is that? -Well, I wasn't dirty. -Order, please. Order. -And now Diane, will you please tell the court what happened after you and Brian picked up Dalfo and drove to PGA Boulevard. -Well, they, uh, got into a fight and were yelling at each other and I got scared. So I ran. -Before you ran, do you recall anything being said? -Yeah. Michael Dalfo said something like if you hurt me or touch me then I'll call my lawyer. Anyway, Brian told me to take off and I-- I ran along the shoulder of the road, and after a couple of minutes he drove up alongside me and I got in the car. -And did Mr. Spencer say anything at that time? -Yes. He said, he can't call his lawyer now. -Your witness. -Did Brian ever tell you that he beat Mr. Dalfo? -No. -Did he ever tell you that he shot Mr. Dalfo? -Well, Brian never told me any details because he thought I wasn't strong enough to understand. -Yes or no. Did Brian Spencer ever tell you that he shot Michael Dalfo? -No. -I have no further question. -Mom? -Baby. How much did I miss? -Not much. -Has the scuz bucket been on the stand yet? -Byron! Where's the keys? -You don't have any teeth. -Don't talk to me about my teeth. I'm in this friggin' airport in Winnipeg and an old dope conviction pops up in the computers, and they say I can't come down here. I haven't got that damn witness subpoena thing on me. My teeth are in my bathroom out in Maple Bay. Everybody's on the phone to everybody. So I decide to chuck the whole thing and fly back. I'm in the air going to Vancouver. The subpoenas in the air headed to Chicago, and my teeth are in the air headed for Palm Beach. -Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. This is not like television. Things do not get wrapped up in an hour. Life is cluttered. Sometimes you have to go through a sinner to get to the devil. The defense would have you believe that Diane was lying. What motive? What possible motive could she have to lie? Her testimony is a public admission to prostitution. She is the mother of a proud man. By testifying, Diane loses, no matter which way this case turns out. No, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, Diane has told [inaudible]. -Amazing. Simply amazing. Why would Brian Spencer murder [inaudible]. Not one witness has stated [inaudible] connected Brian Spencer to the scene. Only Diane. There was nothing linking Brian Spencer to this crime, except Diane. Ladies and gentlemen, Brian Spencer's life is on the line here. [inaudible] plantiff is that the state has not proved its case. Brian Spencer is not guilty. -Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Have you reached a decision? -We have, Your Honor. -Baliff, would you read the charges, please? -On the felony charge of kidnapping, how do you find the defendant? -Not guilty. -On the charge of murder in the first degree, how do you find the defendant? -Not guilty. -All my life I've had this feeling that something was chasing me. Fear, maybe. Like I was on a roller coaster, and it was right behind me, and it finally caught up with me. All that time I had my dad running through my brain, you know? Like he was a train running straight toward me, like we were both on the same track. But neither of us could stop. -No, no, no. No. You got it all wrong. You see, Bobby Orr was like a-- don't get me wrong. I'm no fag. But that guy was beautiful. He had hair and he skated like-- I remember this one time we were playing the Bruins, and I really decked him in this game. And the next morning both teams are in the same hotel. And he was walking through the lobby and he saw me and he put up his thumb, like this, and he says, hey, Spinner. You hurt. -No. -Yeah. It was like Bobby Orr talked to me, man. What can I tell you. -You got smokes? -No. No. I don't. No, sorry. -Shit. -Trust me, this thing works. Hands in the air, keeping moving down the hall. Get in the room! Who's in charge here? I said who's in charge here! -I am. -Who are you? -I'm Don Prentice. I'm the station program director. -I was smoking Monica's, wasn't I? -No, you were smoking mine. Wait. Wait. Didn't you have a whole pack? -No, I don't. -All right, this is robbery. -Did he just say this is a robbery? -Come on, man. Give me your money, man. -He hasn't got any money. -Cough up some money or I'll blow your face off. -Wait. Wait. I don't got much, but what I got you could have, OK? -Everybody in the room! Come on! Move! Get in the room! Move it! -All right, now listen up. I've got a serious disagreement with CBC programming, and there's going to be a revolution unless something changes. -Come on, man. Don't give me [inaudible]. Just give me some money! -Three bucks! -It's all I got. I swear to god. -Come on, man. Give me some money, man. -How much do you weigh anyway? -I said give me some money! -Be afraid of me, buddy. -It's a guarantee, Mr. Prentice. -Absolutely. We'll air your son's game. -Thank you, sir. You're a good man. My apologies to everyone. It's just sometimes I get-- I'm sorry. -Hold it right there, Mr. Spencer. The police. Drop the gun. -You all right? -Yeah. I'm fine. -If I miss anything, I miss training camp. Most of the guys hated it. But me, I loved it. It was like spring cleaning or something. Everything was clean. You looked on the season's schedule and say there's my life. You didn't have to think about anything. You knew where you were going, what you'd be doing, what you'd be wearing. Everything was taken care of. All you had to do was skate. That's all. Just lace 'em up and skate.
