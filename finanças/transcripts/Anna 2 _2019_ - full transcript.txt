[woman screaming] [ominous music] [children laughing] [voice whispering] [suspenseful music] [melancholy music] [eerie music] [Shawn] Oh, write this down. [David] It just sorta lashed out, grabbed both my arms. It scratched me so deep that I felt it in my bones. Felt it in your bones? Pretty exciting stuff. Don't act too eager. When you do that, you can't sell him anything. Hey! Been a while. It's raining. Okay, so this is Jacob. He's actually the second founding member of Freaky Link. [David] I thought it was Links. Everybody does. We beat these sticks and draw the ghost right into the cups, and then we cover it with tape. That's spook tape. That's right, spook tape. Here, let me show you. Sit down. You're gonna love this. It's entering the hocus field. Go right in, go right into... Oh, my god. Hold on, hold on. Great job, but did you have to give him the cups? Of course. He has kids. That of course just means repeat customer. They're be like, "Daddy, daddy, we still have a ghost." Boom. Repeat, rinse, both ways. Rinse and repeat. Okay, that's actually, yeah, that's pretty smart. I know. So who's this? Who? The guy with the sticks. Oh! That's Spartacus. He is no man. What's your name? Vincent. I'm interning for you guys. Yeah. We can't pay him. I know. You heard the man, right? Interning. Dude. I know you're still a little bit irked about that whole doll thing. Dude, so Spartacus told me of a haunted amusement park. It's not that far away. I think this could work for us. Only problem, we don't have a car. [ominous music] [thunder rumbles] It is in this room of the house that the corpse of the body of the child appears, trying to find its mother. Music is said to draw him out. I feel the child is with us now. He is in the mirror. Mirrors are so strong. They hold so much. Mirrors keep us grounded on this earthly plane. It's strange that you're saying these things because a lot of people have been... [knocking on door] Are you expecting someone? Not me. Just keep it rolling on her. So tell us, tell us what you feel. Whoever it is, you need to come back later. There's an investigation going on. We're looking for a group called Spooky Links. We heard they were investigating here. Yes, they're finishing a shoot right now. Could you please leave? Lace, can we please come in and talk? You know what day today is. Ryan. Yeah, come in. What about me? I forgot it's Ryan's birthday. Did you go see him today? Yeah, yeah. I went to his grave. I did. So, I'm just gonna get something out of the way. We know that you don't like us, and we don't like, just you. Yeah, Rob's cool. Don't like what? Ever since Rob and I started our new show, you two have done nothing but harass it. Harass? The emails. Oh. Yeah, I did send hateful emails. But I never signed it. Anonymous. You sent them from your Freaky Link email address. Ah, but I never signed it. Still anonymous. Okay, so how are we supposed to react? I mean, you took all the equipment. Ryan left the equipment to me. He left the business to me. Yeah, but you didn't have to kick us out. I didn't! You two were pulling scams all over town pretending that you were the Ghostbusters or something! [Shawn] Who you gonna call? Why? [Rob] Hey, it did get pretty bad, guys. Okay, okay. So you kick us out, you take Rob, and then we have to go by something else? Freaky Link, it doesn't even sound good. Yeah, can't even afford the S. I couldn't afford a crutch, and you two were the crutch. You were hurting the business. You know, back when we formed this team and we let you guys join with Ryan, Shawn and I, we didn't always get along. I mean, we thought that you thought that we weren't taking things as seriously as we should. And we thought you had a stick up your butt. But the thing is Ryan brought us together. We came together as a team. We worked to save people. I talked to the both of you plenty of times. Yeah, well, you could have made sure we knew you were serious. She did say, "I'm serious." Yeah, but did she use the hand gesture like, "I'm serious." You buried us, okay? I mean, is that what you wanna hear? You won. We're nothing. And we're the ones who saved the world. There is no way that you saved anything but your own skin. Jacob, it's like she was there. We have an idea though to help us both out. We're not trying to join Spooky Links again, but we do ask that there be a joint venture for Freaky Link to get its S back. [Shawn] Freaky Links. A joint adventure? Where? An untapped haunted amusement park. [pensive music] Hi, Freaky Link. Supreme Longbottom, McNasty. Supreme Longbottom and McNasty. Hi, I'm Lace. Rob. Hi. I am Alec. Howdy, partner. [chuckles] Y'all here to do some ghost wrestling? And we're ready to wrestle. Is he serious? Shouldn't you be filming? Rob. You gals and guys have got some pretty strange goings on around these parts. I'm sorry. Are you acting this way for the camera? Oh, I'm sorry. Are we not filming right now? Alec! If you're gonna break character, I'm not paying you. We went through this. This is your first strike. Ah, are you paying him to act this way? We are paying him to act this way, no. Well, lemme tell you something. There are some strange possessions happenings around here. You know, there's actually a history of dangerous demons taking over the youths 'round here. [Shawn] He's free balling. [laughs] And you know where these paranormal possessions are taking place? [Shawn] Para? Paranormal, paranormal. You know this. Oh, cool. Let's do that. [Lace] Do you have a schedule to go on one of these possessions? I, I have, far off into the city. We've got many ways to goes to get theres. Well, if we're gonna go to the city, can we at least get some B roll on the way? Yeah, sure. Let's go! Rob, really? You're gonna make up lines? B roll? [Rob] B roll is a real term. Yeah. Leave the technical terms to the pros, bro. But is a technical term. Let's just go. [eerie music] Nestor would like to know why we are gathered around a tiny fire in the middle of his home. Oh, I did not set this up. Oh, mood lighting. Mood lighting? Yeah. Shawn, we're trying to be professional. We are professional. Yeah, professional, like when you brought out those cups. Okay. You told me that we were not gonna talk about the cups. That's a 1,000-year-old whatever. You can't believe everything you read online, Shawn. What do you mean you can't read? I have to. We're told not to understand the media, don't listen to radio, don't listen to the TV, movies. Now I have to take up a new language and read? - Come on. - Reading is not a new language, Shawn. And you can't believe everything you read either. Okay, you've proven your point. [Jacob] Yes, I have. Wait, mine? [Shawn] Yeah. No, that was your point. No, it was yours. [Jacob] No, it was yours. What? All right, I will tell him. Alec, could you have him tell us a bit about himself? Yes. [mumbles] I work, I work. He does the work. Work? Well, can you tell us what kind of work? Tell us [mumbles]. Speak English, you son of a... He says the type of work that he does, he does with his body. Okay. Well, could you just ask him why he thinks there's a possession, or who he knows that is possessed? [Alec mumbles] I know what she said, you little fuck. What I was saying was me and my daughter... Now what he just said was that him and his daughter was traveling down south the city. There, they were exploring. [Nestor] No... Hush now. Now, what they came across was a strange old area near an abandoned amusement park. There they found a hill, and on the top of this hill was a tree. And this tree was made of dead arms and human bodies hanging from it. He said the tree was the root of all evil, and his daughter was taken by the tree and pulled into it! And what came out and what went inside her body weren't the same thing. Don't you mean tree of flesh? Yes, that's the gateway to all evil. Ooh. Can we meet his daughter? 70 degrees. Kinda cold. This, this seems kinda real. Hey, hey, hey, don't break character. This seems kind of elaborate, you guys. No, no, no, we didn't set this up. [ominous music] How did she manage that? So you want me to find out? Uh-huh. Hey! How'd you do that? Okay, she didn't tell me. Good try. Can I talk to it? Her name is Anya. Go for it, McNasty. Rob, keep it on her. Hi, Anya. [Anya speaks in foreign language] I am Jacob. Hi there. Do you know who I am? Seriously, Jake? What? I've never tried talking to one before. Jacob, do you know who this is? Her name is Anya. Anya. Can you see? See what? [Anya grunts] Jake. Jake! The battery's dead on the camera. Anya, do you feel any pain? This item, it looks for electromagnetic disturbances. Jake, do you honestly think she's gonna put off an electrical field? I'm sorry, do you wanna take over? Have you ever fought off a demon? [Anya screams] [eerie music] What happened? I think she was on her period. I've never seen a bed shoot blood before. Am I the only one noticing that she's on the ceiling right now? Just all part of the show. She was on the ceiling. No show. So this is real. Professional opinion, she's on the damn ceiling. Shawn, what are yoU doing? You want things documented? You call any other paranormal show. You want shit done? You call us. Yeah, holy water. Wait, wait, wait. How did you get that? Don't have you to be an ordained priest or a minister of some kind to get that? No. You put a bible in water. Yeah. I don't think that's gonna work. Come on, there's not some kind of like manual, is there? [Lace sighs] Well, whatever. You know what? This is gonna work. I got this. Step aside. Jake, I'm in. Shawn, I'm right outside the door. Jake, she's looking at me. Shawn, Rob's coming in. Rob, go on. Go. You're next. [suspenseful music] False alarm. It was Rob. She's gone. Okay, I'm gonna attempt to establish contact. Oh. Found her. She's under the bed. Hey. What are you doing under there? Are you enjoying yourself? [Anya] I can't wait for you to join me. Under the bed? [Anya screams] [suspenseful music] You okay? Yeah. Huh. I just saved a little girl's life. That's some kind of movie special effects, right? You didn't set that up, did you? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't hear a word you said over all my awesome. Shawn, nothing in the room was done by you, right? No. Did you just hear? I saved somebody's life. I'm a hero. Okay, Alec, how many people have you witnessed actually being taken over? I don't know. How would I know? You guys hired me. Okay, where did you find this one? Just some nut job that comes into the bar sometimes. Wait, wait, wait. You didn't do some kind of character study? What kind of actor are you? Okay, do we think that this is maybe like not some kind of paranormal entity that was inhabiting her body? Maybe it was some sort of disease. Wait, wait, wait. Are you saying I cured a disease? What type of disease flies away from water? You know what? I'm an amazing actor, actually. Thank you very much. Wait, wait, wait. Dollar Mart of actors. Dollar Mart of actors? Nobody cares about your acting. I can do happy. I can do sad. Hey, shut up! That's it, dude. Shut up, shut up! [Lace sobs] Okay, I think we can actually do some good here if what we found was real. So what if it was real? What if it is an epidemic? What, are we scientists now? There's something back in that tree. Oh, yeah? He's such a great actor, he's off script. He's free balling. Shawn, shut up, okay? So what, are supposed to go and find a tree? I mean, what are we, saving the world from some great evil now? Oh, well, that sounds like some kind of cheap indie movie plot. Shawn, it's serious. People around here think that tree has some sort of evil. And if we go and destroy the tree, we destroy the evil. We could remove the mental thing. It really could help. You guys are saying there's some kind of like ghost epidemic going on? Come on. Yo, we're still here. Alec, is it closing time? I don't even have my drink yet. [Alec] No, they usually close a little later than this. [creatures scream] [eerie music] Now this thing's trying to scare us away. Well, it's working, still working! That's the sign we needed. Sign? Those people are still in there. [Lace] Put me down! Where's this carnival? [eerie music] Jake, what are you doing? Jake. What? What are you doing? [Jacob] I'm taking only what we need. It's like you think we're not coming back. What if we don't? Do you know what we're up against? 'Cause I sure as hell don't. Okay, I think we should think all this over. Jake, I'm with the actor. I mean, can we at least stop and think about what we're doing. I don't know about you guys. I'm in I'm tired of just documenting things. It's time to do something. I don't know if Shawn set this up or what, but I'm ready to find out. Guys, this can't be real. How often is a bump in a house a loose door or a creak just a settling in the house. It all has a reasonable rational explanation. Okay, explain what's happened so far. Explain just one thing and we'll turn around and we'll go back home. Uh... [Jacob] That's what I thought. [Alec] Okay, I'll help. Shawn. You know, you're looking at me like I'm some kind of battle-hardened pro, but I'm not. No, I'm not. It's just me. Okay, well, I mean, if that's good enough for you, then all right, I'm in. Lace. Okay, I'll follow you guys. Yes! You guys have like done this before, right? Yeah, we have. We're here. This is a terrible place for a park. Well, it actually looks like somebody beat us to the punch. Tire tracks. It could be teenagers coming to do a little exploration. So that's what they call it here. This could be some psycho killer's place. He's gonna rape Jake, chop up Lace, eat Alec. And I will be the last one to tell the tale. Hey, what about me? Oh, when did you show up? Thanks for coming, babe. Well, let's go. Wow, this place is massive. This place looks deserted. It's amazing watching you work sometimes. It doesn't even work. Hello? What would you do if somebody answered? Have it. Got it. Ooh, want it. We have to find the heart. That's what all the books say. We have to find the main focus point. You were teased as a child. [suspenseful music] [Lace] Nobody wonder off too far from each other. I don't think ghosts are what we think they are. I mean, like yeah, we think that there are people that died and the spirits are still here, but none of the research I've done has actually proven that, you know. I mean, what if there's something else? What if they like can cross over and mimic us so they can pretend to be alive? Then they come here. I mean, it makes sense. [suspenseful music] Do you have to look over your shoulder every five seconds? [Shawn] I'm not the one humming all the time. [Alec] It's something I do when I get nervous. Cool. Open it. [Jacob] There is no way I'm touching any of that without my hand sanitizer out here. Don't know what you're missing. Whoa, dude, that's a head and a hand in a jar! Alec! Alec! Come back over here and touch this! It's like Scooby Doo. [eerie music] [Voice] Alec. Alec. No. Vincent. Vincent. Vincent. Alec. Here. Here. Here. Why don't you meet the tree? The tree is home, home. Vincent. [Alec screams] [radio shifts stations] Shawn, what happened? Alec ran off. He must have fallen? [radio shifts stations] Shawn? Shawn! [suspenseful music] Shawn, I'm coming! [Woman] Run! [Rob laughs] Rob? Rob? [suspenseful music] Rob? Guys? [Lace gasps] [Louis] Mommy. Mommy. Who, who is that? What are you doing this for? [Louis] Mommy. Mommy. Mommy, why? Why did you kill me? You wanted, you wanted to name me Louis. Don't you remember, mommy? Louis? You weren't alive. I didn't kill you. The doctor said that you weren't alive. [Louis] I knew you didn't love me, mommy. See, they tell me things like that. They tell me everything They? [Louis] Hey! You wanna see me, mommy? Over here. I'm in the water with you. Don't you wanna see me, the child you abandoned? Oh, don't worry. I'll just come to you. Mommy, it's me, your long lost baby. You forgot about me, didn't you? Uh-uh-uh. I miss you.

Where's your friends? It's like some kind of haunted Where's Waldo. Back to back. Okay. Here's what we're gonna do. What? Merry-go-round. Why the merry-go-round? It's Jake's favorite ride. Okay. This way. [creature growls] Okay. All right, let's go back the other way. But we haven't even looked yet. He's not here. Okay. Okay, we're gonna go the other way, look for some chips. Chips? Yeah, chips. Don't question me on this. Okay, you can be the Rambo. All right, this way, chips. Okay, I'm gonna go to the door. You stay right here. If you're gonna get taken away, let me know. Scream like a little girl, got it. [Shawn gasps] Okay, it's your turn. A squirt gun? What are you gonna do with a squirt gun? It makes me feel better. [door creaks open] Guess it was the wind. Jake? Jake? Shawn. Jake! [Rob grunts] [suspenseful music] What the hell. Don't pull on the hair. [Shawn] Light feet. Light feet. Light feet. Are you okay? My legs. Shawn, where were you? I swear, if you say you were in the bathroom again... No, Jake, I was looking for you. We were looking for chips. We spent like a minute looking for you. Chips? Did you find any? No. [suspenseful music] [creature growls] Move it! [Jacob grunts] [creature growls] [Jacob screams] Fight it! Hold it tight! Hold it, hold it, hold it! Damn! Hey! Hey! He's out. Look what you do with all your negativity. We're gonna die because of you. My negativity? You're negative. Negative? I'm the one, I saved you! I can go home right now. Ow! You're not serious. This, this, does that hurt? [Jacob grunts] I'll show you serious! [door creaks open] Shawn. [laid back music] [Lace sobs] You okay? Yeah. Look at you, big mess, big strong man. I held the door. Come on, guys. Let's get outta here. Yeah, let's get outta here. Okay, all right. [playful carnival music] What is all this, guys? It's phase two. They're trying to remove us from our flesh while imprinting us on their film reels. What? When we get out of here, you're gonna tell me how you know all of this. Come on, guys. Guys, Lace. Lace, she's over there in the crowd. Lace! Lace! Lace? Lace! Lace! Rob? [Rob] Lace! Rob! Are you okay? Are you hurt? Are you hurt? No, no. What is all of this? It's called ghosts. You believe us now? We are being imprinted. Let me go! [Shawn] Okay. I saw a film on a projector. All these people are from the past. They're being imprinted. The same thing is happening to us. Why don't we just leave? We're right here! Let's go, you guys. Yeah, we've finished everything. Let's just go. No, that's what they want us to do. [Lace] What? That would be too easy. They're trying to force us out. Wait, so are you saying that if we stay, we're gonna be stuck here. But if we go, we're gonna be stuck here. Yeah. [Shawn] Well, that's a conundrum. When did you learn that word? Just an app, word of the day. Well, so then, what are we really gonna do? [suspenseful music] You three ready? Do not lose the squirt guns. Did I just say that? Roger that. It seems quiet. Roger that. It seems quiet. Are you gonna repeat everything we say? I have one job. It's stupid, but I'm gonna do it. Lace wears baby clothes. Sorry, not sorry. I'm not a man, and I don't wear men's clothing. She says she's fat and wears men's clothes. [chuckles] That is not what I said. [Jacob grunts] Okay. Let's begin phase one. Hello? Hello? Hello? I'm a new person who's never came to this place. And I'm all alone. A new body, brand new body. Hello? I'm wearing a dress! All right, guys. I'm done. [ominous music] I think it knows we're here. Shawn! [Shawn] Pull me back! [creature growls] Guys, pull me back! [Rob screams] [creature grunts] Hey, are you guys okay? What's happening? Are you guys okay? Guys? Hey, are you guys okay? No. Come and get me, motherfucker! [creature growls] [film reel turns] [Voice] Allow some time now for you to take a break. Welcome you person who has already been through two of the steps. And now, welcome to step three. At this moment in time, allow for an unhurried thought process and begin to let your body relax. Relax the best you can. Give yourself space from any distractions and just let your mind wonder. Wondering or daydreaming can open your mind to peace and relaxation for your mind and body. Whatever is going on around you right now, let these sounds gently fade and mix in with this meditation. Have no expectations of anything except being free with your mind to drift anywhere you want to go. Each of your souls will now be extracted one at a time. Observe. Guys, are you okay? What's happening? Guys? Guys, are you there? Screw this. [creature growls] [Man] Now, the next to join. [suspenseful music] And another one's joined us. Water is not damaging, so don't worry. Get ready to join our splendid amusement park. [Lace] Do not lose the squirt guns. All you did was put a bible in water. [Shawn] It's not water. It's gas. [Lace] Ryan. Did you go see him today? [creature growls] [suspenseful music] [melancholy music] [Lace] Okay, I'll follow you guys. [Jacob] Yes! I don't think ghosts are what we think they are. I mean, what if there's something else? What if they like can cross over and mimic us? [children sing in foreign language] Okay, I think we can actually do some good here if what we found was real. [melancholy music] [eerie music] [melancholy music] [dramatic music] You guys help yourselves. You guys found what you were looking for? Yeah. Yes. Yes, we did. Oh, can I get some coffee? [sobs] But you hate coffee. I love coffee. You don't like coffee. Oh, my god. [Jacob sobs] I'll just take a... [Waiter] A juice? Or something. I don't care. [sobs] [Waiter] Okay. Out of towners. Jake, I can't do this anymore. Yeah. I mean it. I'm going home. I know. Why do we keep doing this? Two of our friends are dead. Your legs are broken. We hurt everyone we come into contact with. We'll need more gas. [dramatic music] [eerie music]
