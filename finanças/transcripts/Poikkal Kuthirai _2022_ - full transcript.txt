We don't have pesticides for Tape worm only for cockroaches. Hey, don't use your phone when you're on duty. My phone is ringing. Get that for me. Hello, who's calling? - I'm councillor, Thennarasu, speaking. - Tell me, sir. People have been complaining that you've become a nuisance in the area. Sir, they always change their statements. - It's better to investigate in person. - Sounds about right. I'm waiting at the Tamarind tree. Come right away. Okay, we'll be there. Follow me. Hey, what exactly is the problem? What's your problem? Mr. Councillor, I'm the Secretary of this Housing Board. He has tarnished my reputation. As it is he had a little reputation but now it's totally gone! (Song from 'Rhythm') Oh, no, there's no water supply. - Not bad you could reach the pipe. - Everything looks good. The pipes are all in good condition. How come the three pipes are cut and directed elsewhere? Who has hijacked the water pipes? Come on, let's find out. Thanks for the swimming pool. - Come on! - Wow! - Yeah! - Hey! - He has taken all our water. - Dear, is the water not enough? Dad, the depth is not enough. - Let me add two more pipes. - Okay. Why don't get a straight connection from the dam? - Arrogant man. - Good idea. Listen, to teach your daughter swimming... why would you empty all the tanks and turn your house into a swimming pool? - Is it right? - Absolutely right! I just followed his suggestion. What did I suggest? Brother! Please request the association to build a swimming pool in our locality. My daughter wish to learn swimming. If your daughter wish to learn swimming... you build a swimming pool in your house and teach her. Association can't build one for you. Now tell me I just followed his suggestion. Look, he's got a point. She's a small kid. Let it go! She's not a small kid. She's a little devil. It's 'cause of her my sister's wedding got called off. - Please ask your sister to come. - Sure. Gouri...! - Please make it for the wedding. - Definitely, I'll be there. - We'll take our leave. - Great! Sit down! You can't leave without having coffee. Wait for a minute I'll bring coffee. Son, please have some coffee. Gouri, sorry, we have guests at home. - We too have guests. - I need to serve them coffee. Listen, Magizh. Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey. Coffee! You brat! Hey, Magizh! Hospitality! - I meant, ask him if it's fair. - Asking. All this while you had an excuse for everything. - What's your excuse now? - Justice! I'm outraged now. I'll give her a talking to. - Come on, jump. - Hey, hold on! Come on, everyone scram! - Everyone leave. - I'm taking her home. Come on keep going. Hey, you're leaving without listening to my verdict. You called me to investigate instead he did it. What do you think of me? You call this a council? Come on, tell me? It's not a council neither there's respect for me over here. I had enough. All dismiss! Mom! Bad touch! You just ignore it. Come over here. Mom, don't you understand? I said it's a bad touch. Why should she ignore? Your daughter is being clear that it's a bad touch. Instead of holding this rascal by his collar... you're asking your daughter to stay silent. Hey, who are you calling a rascal? 'Hey, come on!' - Are you okay? - Don't spare him. Kill him! Hey! Thanks a lot, sir. Please listen to what your children have to say. Make them believe that they can come to parents with their problems. Don't tell them to ignore or stay quiet. If you do then you'd never know what they're going through. Okay, sir. Thanks a lot, uncle. Awesome, dad! - Did you understand? - I know. Kathiravan, finally your case has been resolved. Insurance company has issued this cheque in your favour. - Here you go. - Thank you, sir. This is the best the Govt. can compensate for your wife's demise and your leg. Had you not compromised... we could've claimed for a higher amount. Also, we could've got the bus driver fired. The driver did not do it on purpose. I don't want to put a family in hardship for money. Let them be at peace. Thanks a lot for your help. Listen, why don't we start a business with this money? It won't work out. Why don't we clear our debts? That won't work too. Let's do this. Why don't we go to the insurance company... and tell them that we don't know what to do with the money... and give them back the money. Does this work for you? I've already made a decision about what to do with this money. So, you've made a decision? I was giving out ideas in vain. Waste of time! This money belongs to Magizh's mother. She wanted Magizh to have good education. With this money I'm going to get her an admission at a reputed school. Magizh, are you happy? - This money is from my mother, right? - Yes. So, let me decide what to do with this money. - Swimming pool? - Go ahead, dear. With this money we'll buy you a leg. What? I saw on YouTube. People with no leg can get a prosthetic leg. Similarly, we'll get you one too. Dear, I don't want a new leg. I'm doing well with just one leg. Good school is important. For me your leg is important. Magizh, I've made up my mind. School is important. - Understood? - Then you go to school. Hey! Hey, she got angry. Go and pacify her. She'll be back in 5 minutes. - Listen. - What is it, Gouri? Check out what your daughter is up to on the terrace. - What is she doing? - Hey, go and check. Look over there. Magizh! Hey, what's wrong with her? Dear, why are you standing on one leg? Because you're not listening to what I have to say. Dear, it'll hurt. If you stand on one leg. - It'll get swollen. - So would your leg. Entire day you stand on one leg. It'll also get swollen. I'm used to it now. Please put your leg down. Let's go home and discuss. I'll come home only if you hear me out. Until then I'll stand on one leg. She's stubborn. Agree with her. Okay, we'll do as you wish. You please put down your leg. "In this universe..." "Who is there for me like you?" "With love..." "My life goes on 'cause of you" "Two wings have to grow on you" "I will have to sit on your back and fly" "Will have to climb up to the sky And jump on to the moon" "You will have to walk on it Like a king" "Your leg is the tree on which I live" "Your leg is the tree on which I live" "Take a birth again Come past the worries" "To take the first step, Get up and walk" "In this universe..." "Who is there for me like you?" "With love..." "My life goes on 'cause of you" "Holding the small hands Come running like the breeze" "As I dance in the clouds Come and dance with me" "The universe is there for you to walk" "My lap is there for you to sleep" "In this universe..." That was awesome! How dare you mock me? Just wait and watch when my father arrives on the annual day. (Spanish song) What happened? It must be an act. Magizh? Hey, let's go and check. Hey, how come Magizh's dad could walk now? I have no clue. Magizh! Hey! Dear, Magizh, please look at me. Dear, Magizh! Let's take her to the hospital. - Dear! - Pick her up. Come on, be careful. Madam, doctor! - Madam, it's an emergency. - Doctor! - What happened? - Doctor, she fainted. Okay, come with me. Where's the duty doctor? Could you please come here. Sir, please lay the kid on this bed. What happened to the kid? She fainted at school. She has been unconscious for a long time. Please check. - Oh, no. - Please hold on. Kathir, hold on, let them check. What happened, doctor? - Ask them what happened? - Wait, they'll let you know. Dear, Magizh. - Hey, what happened? - Just wait! - What happened? - Kathir, let's go. Sir, please take him away. Let us do our job. Hey, come on, be strong. Did Dhana sister inform you? Kathir. Look, Gouri has come. What happened to Magizh? Are you Magizh's father? Your daughter has been shifted to the paediatrics ward. You can go and see her. Hey, she's over here. Magizh? - Magizh? - Dear! When would she wake up? Right now the saturation is stable. In a while she should regain consciousness. - Sir? - Yeah. Kathir, they're calling you. Chief doctor wants to meet you. Gouri, please take care of the child. Come on, let's go. What happened to my daughter, Magizh? I'm scared. It's an anomaly. Aberrant Right Subclavian Artery Could you please explain what's anomaly? Anomaly is something that deviates from what is standard. We could say deviation from normal behaviour. One minute. See, this is human heart. The right side subclavian artery should branch out like this. In Magizh's case, it doesn't separate as two branches from right subclavian artery. One branches out from the right subclavian artery... and another branches out from descending artery. That should not happen. That's why we call it an anomaly condition. Doctor, where does it leave my daughter? We believe nothing should happen. But unfortunately it's a serious condition. But there's a solution. If we perform a surgery and remove the branch. It'll be permanently cured. Doctor, we're worried about surgery. How could a healthy kid suddenly fall sick? It wouldn't have happened all of a sudden. It's an anomaly from birth. For example; a kid with a good appetite... 'eventually would've stopped eating well.' 'While playing she might've trouble breathing.' Thank goodness that you brought her to the hospital on time. The only option left is to go ahead with the surgery. Okay, Mahesh, will explain the other formalities. Take care. - Okay. - Sure, sir. Sir, is there really no other option? - We're scared! - Don't worry about the surgery. We have the best team with us. How much would the surgery cost? It'll maximum cost you 7 million. That's about it. It's an one-time-surgery. After the surgery your daughter will be back to normal. - 7 million? - Yes, sir. Sooner you make the decision better for your daughter. At the most you should get it done in one and a half month. Until then your daughter should be under our hospital doctors observation. Sir, is there no other option? I don't get it. You're saying it'll cost 7 million for the surgery. Moreover you want our child to remain admitted over here. Sir, look at us. Do you think we can afford this? - You're not even giving time to think. - I'm not forcing you. I'm just stating the facts. You're free to take your daughter home. Take a second opinion. It's your right. We have no objection. And we won't stop you. But before you leave sign a release form. What form? We're taking her on our own risk. We're responsible if something were to happen to my daughter. Hospital and the doctors are not responsible for it. Just sign that form. It's just a formality. - Sir, this is absurd. - What else do you expect? Your daughter is in critical condition and needs a surgery. But you're contemplating. I've explained the procedure to you. Now it's up to you to make the decision. - I'll make arrangements. - Okay, sir. Hey, why did you agree to pay 7 million? Even if we steal we can't get that kind of money. How are we going to get it? Who are you going to ask? All these years my son never came to meet me. But now you're here. I believe you're in trouble. Go on, tell me. I was living a meaningless life. My daughter, Magizh gave a purpose to my life. She's just like my mother. Mother indeed! She has a heart condition. They say it'll cost 7 million for the treatment. I don't have that kind of money. If you could give me the stolen money you may have stashed somewhere... I will save my daughter. I believed that life is uncertain and doesn't turn out as we plan. So, I never saved. I have no money. Kathirava, stop. I said I have no money. Never said we can't save your daughter. Nothing will happen to her. One... One minute. I'll be back. Kathirava, this is Shreya. She's going to save your daughter. I don't get it. She's the last heir to RMR family. If you kidnap her you can save your daughter. I think your brain caught rust locked up in the prison. I made a mistake by coming to you for help. Kathirava, we don't have a choice. Only this could save our Magizh! You want me to kidnap this child to save my child? I'd rather beg to people and save my child. Get lost! Kathirava, don't waste time. You won't find the good souls that you're looking for. Because the world has changed. Kathirava- Kathirava, you're asking for a huge amount. I don't have that kind of money. Brother, I can't help you with it. You know my situation. I'm looking to borrow myself to pay the school fees. I don't have money. Kathirava, ask me for anything but money. 'I'll make sure to do it for you.' 'Please for God sake don't call me again asking for money.' Hey, any luck with the money? Kathir? I had asked for a loan for my daughter's surgery. Do you think I'm running a Govt. office? To provide you with PF and loan. Get back to work. Asking for a loan! I paid 2 lakhs for the prosthetic leg. Could you take it back and refund my money? I need it for my daughter's surgery. Sir, this was tailor-made for you. It won't match the others. Please understand, sir. We're of no help. Sorry, sir! Madam, I'm here to pay the bill. - How much are you paying? - 70, 000 rupees. Sir, at least you'd have to make a payment of 1 lakh. Hey, give me that. I said give it! Make it under the name of Magizh. Okay, sir. Did she eat? She just had some juice and got back to sleep. She was asking for you. Dad... when will you take me home? Dad, I don't like to stay out here. We'll get back home soon. I'll make sure to take you home soon. - Okay, dad. - Kathiravan. Could you please come with me. I'll be back. Kathiravan, I checked your account. You have only paid the hospital fee. The surgery fee is still pending. When will you make it? I need some time. I'll make it soon. Don't delay. It'll complicate the surgery. See through it. It's for your own good. Loan sharks threaten to repay the loan. But these people will threaten to make the payment. It's a group that's determined to abolish the less fortunate. Sir, I'm already stressed out don't know what to do. And you're making it worse. Sir, my name is Nandan. I come from an NGO called Helping Arm. I came to know about your situation. - I'm here to help you. - I don't get it. Many people donate money to our NGO. With the donated money we help a lot of poor families. I know that you're in need of help. Sir, this is our business card. Bring your daughter's medical records to our office tomorrow. We'll surely help you. Sir, we've tried every possible option. Sir, please help us out. - We have a crowd funding website. - Okay. On that we'll mention your condition, the amount required for surgery and the doctor certificates. We'll upload all the documents and promote the listing. Hey, Kathir. Is it like the listings we see on social media? Sir, nowadays promotions are the key to everything. Only if we follow this you'd get the amount required for the surgery. But it'll cost you a little. You'll have to bear the cost. How much would it cost? We'll shoot a video with you and your daughter. And we'll share that video on all the social media platforms. It'll cost you minimum 1 lakh. If you're okay with it. We'll begin the process right away. Okay? I am Kathiravan. I work at the pest control. 'My daughter Magizh is 7 years old.' 'She was a healthy kid. But suddenly one day she fainted.' 'When we took her to the hospital...' 'we were told that the treatment would cost a lot.' 'I don't have that kind of money.' 'I'm not in a position do hard work like other people.' 'My daughter doesn't have a mother.' 'I live in an ordinary housing board.' 'I'd be grateful if you could donate and help me save my daughter.' 'For God sake, please help me.' - Hello, sir. - Welcome, Kathiravan. - You had summoned me. - Your video has gone viral. We've collected around 1.5 million. Take a look. Sir, you've mentioned 15 million whereas we need only 7 million. It shows that we've collected 8.5 million... but you say we've collected only 1.5 million. It's a strategy. Only if we ask for 15 million they'd donate 50% of it. This is people's mindset. Do you know why we've listed 8.5 million instead of 1.5 million? As it's close to the target... everyone would start donating money. It's like what the street vendors do. Do you get it? Sounds complicated. If you could give me the collected funds I can give it to the hospital-- Kathiravan, that's not how it works. We can withdraw the funds only after we've hit the target. See, you've waited so long. Wait for another 2-3 days. We'll withdraw the entire fund and make the payment. Okay? That's about it! Here, please sign this form. Okay! Just 2 days. We'll sort it out. Be happy. - Gouri. - You look very happy. It's been long since I saw you smile. We're getting money for the surgery. Wow, that's awesome. I should thank, Nandan, sir. Soon, dad will take you home. Dad, did I trouble you too much? Hey, you were never a trouble, my dear. I was lonely for a long time... you came as an angel in my life. You're my world, dear. You're my only happiness. You're not a trouble at all. Okay, dad. "O' dear, My precious" "Happy clouds above you" "O' dear, My precious" "Who can smile like you?" "When I became lonely And was about to leave this life" "You came as a green parrot And sat on my shoulders!" "You opened your wings Like two leaves" "You brought me back from death" "O' dear, My precious" "Happy clouds above you" "O' dear, My precious" "Who can smile like you?" "Aren't all the walls in the home For you to scribble?" "Isn't it my work to gather all The things that you throw around?" "Isn't the daily sheet calendar here To be torn for making clothes?" "Isn't the phone there To be learnt to be broken?" "Burn the tears with love" "Smile all the days, all the time" "Sadness will engulf one day The next day it will vanish" "When you spread your wings The world will open up" "O' dear, My precious" - Why there's police? '- You frauds!' - No idea. '- They gain trust and deceive.' 'I wonder how they could play with children's lives.' 'These frauds should not be spared.' Brother, what happened? You thieves. In the name of NGO, they raise funds for hospital treatment... they target helpless families and promise to help them and take money for them to post an ad online. But they didn't give the funds collected to the affected families... instead swindled it all and fled the city. - 4th floor? - Yes, 40 million! 'I pity the families who've been struggling to make the payment at the hospitals.' 'If we perform a surgery and remove the branch.' 'It'll be permanently cured.' 'Don't delay. It'll complicate the surgery.' 'It's a group that's determined to abolish the less fortunate.' 'Dad, when will you take me home?' 'It's a strategy!' 'Soon dad will take you back home.' 'You won't find the good souls that you're looking for.' 'Because the world has changed.' As you couldn't find the good souls, you've returned to the evil one. In this world there's no room for, right, wrong, good, or justice. It all comes down to 'need.' It's the need that makes a person choose sides. Now you've picked my side. I don't understand anything. I have to save my daughter. That's why I'm here for your help. Only when all hope is lost... one could drum up courage to do anything. In prison I may not get many things but we get newspapers in abundance. Everyone reads news. But I make a note of the things in the newspaper. I've been gathering information over 7-8 years. When I put together different news... I found a story. A story that'll change your story. Rudra's story! 'RMR Transcorp. Import and Export' 'One of the leading companies in India.' 'Rudra, is the Managing Director of the company.' 'But a few years ago...' 'her father Siva Subramaniam was the Managing Director.' 'Often you get to see the name of RMR Transcorp in papers for being the No.1.' 'Deva was hired by, Siva Subramaniam.' 'Deva and Rudra, fell in love.' 'Siva Subramaniam was against their love.' Rudra, is very strong. She doesn't fear anyone while making a decision. 'Once such decision was her marriage.' 'Later, Rudra and Deva started to live away from her father.' 'Rudra, got pregnant.' 'Deva took good care of Rudra.' 'Her father was angry with the son-in-law.' 'But the news of daughter's pregnancy...' 'brought him back looking for her daughter.' 'On Siva Subramaniam's request both returned home.' 'Listen closely, Siva Subramaniam accepted his daughter and her child...' 'but not Deva.' 'Deva believed after Shreya is born everything would fall in place.' 'But Siva Subramaniam hated Deva even more.' 'That's when there was a raid at the company.' 'Foreign currencies and drugs were found.' 'Siva Subramaniam's name was tarnished in media and papers.' 'Similarly, their treasured RMR Trancorp's reputation was dragged to dust.' 'Not able to recover from the bad name Siva Subramaniam committed suicide.' 'This shocked Rudra.' 'Press and media tore them apart.' 'They didn't spare Deva too.' 'Deva could not handle it.' 'Deva, to save his self-respect made a decision.' Where are you going? Shreya and I are going to my home. Your home? Why? I don't want my daughter staying here. I asked why? I thought you were rich people. But only now I know how you people became rich. Your dad's decision is the result of all your sins. I don't want the sins to follow me and my daughter. Deva, you're wrong about it. Your dad committed so many mistakes but always looked down upon me. I bear it all just for my daughter. The drug deal that went down in your company... I'm not sure who all were part of it. But I'm scared they may be a danger to my daughter's life. It's your family that made the mistake. Why should we suffer for it? - We're leaving! - She's not just your daughter. Shreya is my daughter! She'll stay with me. If you don't like it, you may leave. It's rich people arrogance speaking. I believe in justice. Let the court decide who should Shreya live with. 'Deva, filed for divorce at the court.' 'That's when Rudra became the MD of the company.' 'She started rectifying the issues in the company.' 'The issues in the company.' 'The custody battle for Shreya.' 'All these problems affected Rudra's health.' 'Deva claimed that Shreya will be in danger if she'd lived with Rudra.' 'Rudra hired a bodyguard to save Shreya from the danger.' Shreya is the only reason you've been appointed as a bodyguard. - Okay, ma'am. - I want your focus on Shreya, 24/7. - It's very important. - Okay, ma'am. If you could surpass them and kidnap, Shreya... you can save, Magizh! But if you get caught... My daughter is fighting for her life. To save her I'm ready to face anything. "Go, to find the track Go beyond the sky" "Go, to find the truth Go beyond the lies" "Go, to find the future Go past today" "Go, to find the universe Go past yourself" "As your brain keeps saying It is wrong, it is wrong" "For your heart to go ignoring that It will say it is right, it is right" "You are killing all the obstacles From outside" "To find the answer, You are walking with one leg" Hey, what are you doing over here? My question exactly! What are you doing? What else do you expect me to do? People who could are neglecting to help. Promised to help and swindled the donation. You're already aware of it. I don't know what else to do. I have to save my daughter. So, you've decided to kidnap? Hey, 7 years ago I lost my leg in an accident. I never felt helpless. As a father, what if I'm not able to save my daughter... that thought makes me feel totally helpless. My daughter can cry if I'm not alive. But I should not cry... 'cause my daughter is dead. I won't cry. You better leave. Go! Hey, didn't I say not to come along? Listen, I was with you all this while. So, I'll be always there for you. Don't ask me for an explanation. Magizh is important to me as well. Start the car. "Won't the obstacles break?" "Won't the obstacles break?" "Won't the obstacles break?" "Won't the obstacles break?" "Go, to find the track Go beyond the sky" "Go, to find the truth Go beyond the lies" "Go, to find the future Go past today" "Go, to find the universe Go past yourself" "It might now appear As an endless ocean" "Your ship might sail Through the storm" "As far as you can see There is no land" "Even as the water burns There are no clouds in your sky" "Sharks, sharks and sharks Will be swimming in the water" "Leave the vessel, Jump into the water and fight" "If you get to the depth And win over the sharks" "If the strength of your will Is you anchor" "Won't the obstacles break?" "Won't the obstacles break?" "Won't the obstacles break?" "Won't the obstacles break?" Sending shipments without quality checks at the yard... is bringing bad name to the company. I can't repeat the same mistake. Without my permission or signature no shipment should be authorized. - Okay? - Okay, ma'am. Hey! Oh, no! It's just a cockroach. You're screaming as if you saw a Godzilla. - Ahmed, call for pest control. - Okay, ma'am. - Who are you? - Pest control. You may go inside. - Pest control? - Yes, sir. Let's go. Not sure how but the office is infested with cockroaches. I'll fix it, sir. This is our madam's room. You can start from here. - Okay, sir. - Okay. Excuse, me. Why are you limping? - Prosthetic. - Oh, sorry, sorry! It's okay, sir. "Go, go fearless In search of the evil" "Go like the galaxy That swims in the night" "Go, go into the thick woods Like the hunter" "The end has to come, go!" "There are many paths But the path to the truth is only one" "There are many faces But only one face will speak the truth" "If you believe money is a disease" "If you believe the light will appear" Madam, I went through your health report. Your heart rate has increased than usual. If this continues you may get a heart attack. Sir, work is bound to bring stress. I can't be walking around with a BP machine. I'm not asking you to do that. It'll be good if you could avoid work that causes stress. With my company's current situation I can't avoid stress. I have to take care of everything. Suggest me another option. As a doctor I should not suggest it. With advanced technology at disposal we could try this. Madam, on your iWatch... activate the heart-rate monitor. Suppose if your heart-rate increases... an emergency alert would show up. During that time take the tablets I prescribe. Okay, thank you, doctor. "Won't the obstacles break?" "Won't the obstacles break?" "Won't the obstacles break?" "Won't the obstacles break?" "Won't the obstacles break?" "Won't the obstacles break?" "Won't the obstacles break?" The court order is here, ma'am. The child has to be with her father twice a week. - Actually-- - It was expected. Ahmed, ask him to pick up Shreya on every Friday from the school. And drop her back on Monday morning at the school. Okay, ma'am. 'You don't have to pick up Shreya on Friday evenings.' 'You pick her up on Monday evenings directly from the school.' - Inform the school as well. - I'll inform them, madam. '- Take care of the formalities. - Yes, ma'am.' You were asking when we were going to kidnap the kid, right? - It's about time now. - When? Coming this Friday. We're going to kidnap the kid How are we going to do it? Deva will be at the school on Friday to pick up, Shreya. Deva should not come to the school. That's your responsibility. Hey, where are you going? Hey, stop right there! You're parked out front and where are you headed? Hello? - This is Deva, Shreya's father. - Tell me, sir. I am supposed to pick up Shreya from the school. I'll send my Manager, Mani. Please send her with him. Okay, sir. Ask him to bring along an ID proof. Ma'am! - What is it, Ahmed? - Check this footage. Not sure who's the man in the footage. But he has been tailing you for the last one month. He infested the AC with cockroaches. Later came to the office as pest control... and fixed this bug under your table. Shit! - Hello. - What do you think of yourself? By preventing me from taking Shreya home today... won't make you a winner. You're blabbering! Obviously, there's an auto is parked in front of my car. I stepped out to check... but when I returned all the 4 tires were flat. I know it's you who is preventing me from going to the school. Hello? Hello! Ahmed, he was not following me. He has been following Shreya. Take out the car. We're going to the school. It'll take an hour for Deva to get here. As per our plan... I've informed the school that a man called Mani will pick up Shreya. You may go now. Be careful. Go. - Good evening. - Good evening, sir. I am Mani. I work for Deva, sir. His daughter Shreya is in class 4C. - I'm here to pick up her. - Please show me your ID. Here you go, sir. - Shreya, 4C. - Okay, sir. Please wait, sir. - Hello. - Hi, I'm Rudra. I'm Shreya's mother. Class 4C. I'm on my way to pick up Shreya. No matter who comes please don't send her with them. - Please! - Sure, ma'am. - Yeah, thanks. - Okay, ma'am. Hey, pick up the phone. Tell me. Hey, Kathir, Rudra has arrived at the school. - Are you serious? - I have no idea. Excuse, me. I'm talking to you. Stop right there. Hello, mister! Sir, I looked everywhere in the school. Shreya is missing, sir. - Did he say anything about Shreya? - No, ma'am. Once again he's lying. If you didn't kidnap, Shreya. Then who sent this? Are you going to deny that it's not you? Madam... It's me in this video. I followed your daughter too. But I didn't kidnap her. Why do you keep lying? I'm not lying, madam. I'm speaking the truth. I did follow your daughter. I did plan to kidnap your daughter. But I didn't kidnap her. I have nothing to do with the package you received. The package I sent should've reached your residence. Please check. Okay, ma'am. Madam! - Is this the one? - Yeah. Please open the package. There will be a letter inside the package. Your daughter, Sherya is safe under my custody. But onwards her safety depends on your response. If you pay a ransom of 7 million at the place and time I mention... I'll return your daughter safe and sound. Don't go to the Police. It's a waste of time. This package was sent by me. I did this to scare you. At the same time I didn't want to hurt the kid. I became overconfident and bought a new dress and couriered it to you. Hey, what happened, Rudra? Did you get the information I asked for? Magizh, a 7-year-old kid is admitted at the hospital with a heart condition. The surgery will cost 7 million. If they don't perform the surgery in the next 48 hours, it'll be fatal for the kid. I did it for her. I planned to kidnap your daughter to save mine. But someone else kidnapped her before I could. Please believe me, madam. Even now I don't entirely believe you. Tell me if you have my child. I'll give you 7 million. Hey, have you gone mad? You're nego-- Ahmed, call detective Stephen and make an appointment. Let's stop wasting time. I'm letting you go 'cause of your daughter. Get lost! Madam! One minute. If I find your daughter... will you help me save my daughter? You were ready to pay me 7 million... when you believed I kidnapped your daughter. If I save your daughter, Shreya... would you still pay me? - How can you do it? - I can do it. It's because my daughter's life is important to me. In our country... if it's past 72 hours since a child goes missing then it's impossible to find the child. It has already been 24 hours. To save my daughter and to find your daughter... we're left with only 48 hours. It's not an easy task to kidnap RMR's grandchild. If they plan to kidnap your daughter surpassing your security... they should have been working on this for a month. They must've tailed you very closely. Kidnapping your daughter and risking their lives are the same. Only a person who is determined as me could've done it. I will find him and bring your daughter back. Do you promise to save my daughter? If you bring my daughter back within the stipulated time... I'll fulfill your demands. Rudra, he's ranting some nonsense. And you're paying heed to him. You're playing with my daughter's life. If I go to the Police is there guarantee for my daughter's life. The last chance to save her daughter is to find my daughter. I know what I'm doing. I'm giving 48 hours to save yourself. Like he followed us. At least for next 48 hours follow him. Hey, why did you bring us over to the school? This is where the child went missing. We should begin the search from here. During the 7th period, Shreya was inside the class. After that it was PT period. The kids went to play. Sir, the kids who go to play always return when the bell rings. While playing the other kids noticed Shreya. But Shreya never returned to the class. - Play this footage. - Okay, sir. Sir, please take a look. Shreya. Change the camera. 'Shouldn't the corporation vehicle enter?' Why did this vehicle enter the school? I don't know, sir. You charge a lot as fee but your security detail is poor. Sorry, sir. Play the exit camera. Freeze! Zoom! - Give him the pen-drive. - Here you go. Take a look at this, sir. - Play the next footage. - Okay, sir. Freeze! RTM. RTM. - Hi. - Welcome, sir. - I need to see the Manager. - Okay, sir. I have a few doubts about the bike. Sir, tell me what is it? I'll clear your doubts. Hey, we can't talk to you. We need to talk to your manager. Take us to him. Sir, two men have arrived to buy the bike. They would like to meet you. Send them in. Sir, you both can go and meet the manager. - Excuse, me. - Yes, come in. Take a seat. Leg-- It's my leg! Which model bike are you looking for? - We're not here to buy a bike. - Then? - But we need a bike. - I don't get it, sir. Sir... please! At Annanagar 6th Avenue, lives a housewife, Ahalya. We're going to kidnap her. We need a bike with 'For Registration' number plate. Who the heck are you? You're asking for a bike to kidnap my wife. - I'm calling the Police. - Sir, sorry, sir. Please, please, hang up. We're leaving. Sorry, sir. - Now call the Police. - Sir? - Make the call. - Sir, let's not involve the Police. - Please tell me what I can do for you? - Who are those boys? What's their connection with our daughter's kidnapping? 'The prospective customers that buy this bike are college students.' 'The number of boys enquire about the bike are more than the ones who actually buy.' 'They're our target.' 'We give them the bike to test ride.' 'We pick the boys that suit our needs and assign them work.' 'And we pay them accordingly for the assigned job.' 'They diligently follow the people and collect information for us.' My work is to be discreet and not draw suspicion. I give the bikes for test ride. And collect them after the work is done. I get paid for doing this job. Who orders the boys to follow? And who pays you? Sir, if I reveal that my life will be in danger. Oh, your life, is it? To heck with your life. Sir, I'll confess. Dr. Manohar from BR Child Care hospital at Poonamallee. Manohar! Sir, did you buy the bike? Your Manager got royally from us. I thought they were here to buy. But he says the Manager got it. Tell me! Tell me! You better confess! I'll confess. I'll confess. - I'll confess. - Better tell the truth. Tell us where is the kid you kidnapped? I'm not sure which kid are you talking about? But the kids who were kidnapped until yesterday... I did a check up and sent them for shipment. What do you mean by all the kids? How many kids did you kidnap? Why are you testing them? 'I run a blood test on the kidnapped kids.' 'We match it with the patients waiting for organ transplant.' 'When they match I run a full body check up.' Kids who are eligible for full body transplant... are sent to different counties through containers on the ship. Once the containers enter the ship... no matter what you do you can't save them. Who is running this operation? Durai. It's him who handles the shipment. Where can I find, Durai? When is the shipment scheduled for dispatch? The kidnapped kids will be inside the containers stashed at the yard. Hey, you spoke about Durai! But there's no one here. Sir, he must be around somewhere. Are you okay? Come on! Sir, what's happening out here? Hey, kill him! Buddy! Get up! He's is that traitor. Speak up! Tell me where are the kids? Hey, speak up! Tell me! Hey, I said speak up. Tell me! Why did you shoot him? Only he knows where the kids are. I didn't shoot. He came to shoot you. I was just trying to stop him. I didn't mean to shoot. My daughter must be in one of these containers. Come on, let's search. Come on! - Did you find them? - What happened? Let's go. [children crying in distance] Nothing would have happened to Shreya I'm sure we'll find her. We'll find her... I didn't shoot him on purpose. I had no choice. I'm not asking for an explanation. Why did you go over there? It's been 2 days since our daughter went missing. You're trusting this criminal. But I don't trust him. That's why I followed him. I followed him 'cause I was determined to find my daughter. Only after arriving at the yard I learn the truth. That our manager was the culprit who used our company's name for illegal business. Yes, ma'am. He's telling the truth. The manager is the reason why our company's name got tarnished. We should've trusted your father. In a way we all are a reason for his death. Rudra? Madam! I blame myself for your health condition. Company got a bad reputation. On top of that your father passed away. During this hard time I should've been there for you. But I believed the rumors and left you. And I put pressure on you with court case. Had I not left you the other day... our daughter, Shreya would've been with us. Forgive me Rudra. Please forgive me. Hereafter, I won't leave your sight. Ma'am Asst. Commissioner is here to meet you. - Send him in. - Okay, ma'am. Kathiravan, if you're here in the presence of the Police... it'll cause trouble for you and your daughter. You may leave. I'll take care of my problem. Madam, my daughter is at hospital-- Welcome, sir. Should I thank you for saving the kids? Or should I investigate the murder? Eventually, both has to be done. So, tell me. - What happened out there? - Sir, what happened was-- Sir, my manager was running illegal business under our company's name. My husband and my bodyguard found out about it... and he tried to kill them. In self-defense, my bodyguard shot him with his licensed gun. You can take away Ahmed with you. My lawyer will contact you shortly. Okay, then let's go, Ahmed. So, it happened exactly as you mentioned? Yes. Where's your daughter? She's at our relatives. Relatives? Fine, say hi to her. I understand that you saved me from the Police. But why didn't you inform the AC about Shreya? First, realize what's happening around us? Shreya's kidnappers need something from me. That's why he sent a package to threaten us. Only if we know his demands... we'll know about him and we can decide our next move. "Oh, tear. My dear, tears" "You keep falling despite my warning" "Oh, tear. My dear, tears" "Why are you living with my eyes?" "Oh, tear. My dear, tears" "You keep flowing like An unstoppable river" "Oh, tear. My dear, tears" "Why are you creating images?" "My sky is full of Your smell and your colour" "I've given up my universe for you, Where will I go?" "There is no way I can break Into smaller pieces than this" "There are no fingers to wipe Fall on your own" "Oh tear, why have you also stopped?" "Just like me, at least you step forward!" "Oh, tear. My dear, tears" "You keep falling despite my warning" "Oh, tear. My dear, tears" "Why are you living with my eyes?" "Oh, tear. My dear, tears" Kathiravan! Kathiravan. Sir, I need more time to make the payment. Why do you need more time? Your account has been settled. They've paid the money required for the surgery. - It's been paid? - Yes. Who did it? RMR company's Managing Director, Rudra. She paid off the expenses for the surgery in one full payment. We can schedule the surgery for tomorrow. Be happy! My dear! Magizh! Magizh! - My daughter was here a while ago. - I have no idea. Nurse, my daughter was on this bed. She's missing. Did you shift her to another room? I don't know, sir. I just logged in for the shift. - What if the doctor has moved her? - I don't know, sir. What if another nurse on duty... I didn't notice, sir. What's happening? - Brother? - Yes, sir. A 7 year old child. My daughter. Did you see her going to the rest room? I don't know, sir. Please ask someone else. Doctor! My daughter, Magizh. You too ran a check up on her. She's missing from her room. I asked everyone but no one has an idea. How about you? I have no idea too. Did you pay the hospital fees? It has been paid, doctor. Why don't you check at the reception? - Madam. - Yes, sir. My daughter, Magizh is missing from her room. I checked everywhere but she's nowhere to be found. Did you people shift her to another room? Sir, please don't panic. Let me check that for you. Sir, we didn't change her room. Why don't you keep searching? Listen, do you even understand what I'm saying?! My daughter, Magizh is missing. Kathiravan, why are you creating a scene? Sir, my daughter, Magizh is missing. I enquired but no one seem to give me a proper answer. Listen, there are a lot of patients at the hospital. We can't micro-monitor your daughter. As you're saying that she's missing. Wait we'll look for her. Hey! Will you let a patient step out of the hospital without paying the bill? You do micro-monitor under those circumstances. You don't even permit a corpse to get out without settling the bill. I settled the entire payment. And when I question... you people don't care to answer. Hey! If something happens to my daughter... 'Why are you screaming at them?' 'If you want your daughter to stay alive...' 'come to the location I've shared with you.' Stop right there. You may go now. Hey, Madhan! - Kathir... - Gouri? Hey, Kathir, they kidnapped us all together. But I don't know where's Magizh! Hello! 'Despite making the payment for your daughter's surgery...' 'it shocked you 'cause we kidnapped her right before the surgery.' 'I had kidnapped 24 children...' 'and was about to deliver them in 4-5 days.' 'But you found the container and saved them all.' 'Don't you think that would've shocked me?' 'Hey, you have no idea about the loss you caused me.' 'Now you have to make up for the loss.' 'Now you have to call Rudra.' 'Tell her that you have her daughter, Shreya.' 'And if she wish to see her daughter alive...' 'ask her to pay 100 million as ransom tomorrow at 10:00 AM.' 'She'll definitely pay the ransom.' 'You collect and give me the ransom. After that you can take your daughter.' Hey, she won't believe me. She knows very well that I don't have her daughter. 'Give the phone to the guy in front of you.' 'Hey, take him to the girl.' Okay, boss! Let's go! Hey! - Shreya-- - Hey, speak to him. 'Now call Rudra. She'll believe you.' Tell me, Kathiravan. Thanks a lot for helping me with my daughter's surgery. - Don't mention. - My daughter wants to meet you. Maybe another day. I'm not in the right mindset now. Madam, please say hi to her. Shreya! Deva! Kathiravan found Shreya. Tell me where are you? We'll come right away. Please come, madam. But not now. Because you have no idea about the situation. Come alone with 100 million tomorrow at 10:00 AM to the place I mention. After paying the ransom you can take your daughter home. What are you saying? I'm saying that I'm the kidnapper. As I got caught I was putting up an act for the last 2 days. I'll hand over your daughter alive only if you pay the ransom of 100 million. I'm warning you not to go to the Police. - I hope you understood. - Hey-- - What are you doing, Rudra? - I'm calling the Police. Sit down. He looks very confident as he called from his own phone. I think we should calm down and think about it. Because he's holding Shreya as captive. First, let us make the ransom. And bring back Shreya home safe. After that I'll find him myself and kill him. Please, dear trust me on this. Hello, Rudra has arrived. Hey, Rudra is here. Step out of the vehicle. When will you release, Shreya? Once I safely return your daughter will come home. - Do you think this money will save you? - It'll save my daughter. Kathiravan, this money won't save anyone. Until yesterday it was your daughter who saved you from me. Now my daughter is saving you from me. Your days are numbered. Why is the bulldozer heading towards us? - Hey, he escaped. - Hey, catch him! Come on! Hey, stop right there. Hey, I said stop! Hey, I said stop, damn it! Hey! Sir, where's my daughter? I did everything you asked me to do. Now tell me where's my daughter? How do we know where's your daughter? You better ask the man sitting down over there. Sorry, Kathir. I had no other choice. You did it for your daughter. And I did it for myself. I too need money. You looked for Rudra's daughter everywhere. I'm sure that you never suspected me. You trusted me. You too right? 'RMR Transcorp, 75 years of trust.' 'Due to the pristine reputation of the company...' 'no one check their containers at the ports across India.' 'I found illegal means to do business through RMR Transcorp.' 'I lured his loyal workers towards me.' 'I started making loads of money...' 'by smuggling drugs, trafficking and illegal currencies.' 'Everything was working well.' 'A sudden raid!' 'The company's name got tarnished.' 'Press. Media. Rudra.' 'Everyone started to interfere.' 'I used that opportunity to my advantage...' 'and I killed Siva Subramaniam.' 'And posed it as a suicide.' 'I made him a scapegoat for all my bad deeds.' 'Rudra was shattered!' 'Before Rudra could recoup from the tragedy...' 'I believed I'll be the next Managing Director of RMR Transcorp.' 'But Rudra herself became the Managing Director.' 'She imposed a new rule that no shipment should be scheduled...' 'without undergoing Quality Check at the company.' 'I was not able to carry out any illegal activities.' 'The pressure mounted from the clients to whom I owed my money.' 'To make up for the loss they gave me an assignment.' 'I was told to kidnap 25 children and send them to Africa.' 'And for that we needed Rudra's signature.' 'If Rudra has to sign, her weakest link...' 'is my daughter, Shreya.' 'I planned to kidnap Shreya and make Rudra sign the papers.' 'That's when your friend--' 'Sorry, now your enemy switched sides.' Why did you want to meet me? People have planned to kidnap your daughter. They've planned to kidnap my daughter? Your surprise shocks me, brother. They're going to threaten Rudra to sign the clearance certificate. So, you have planned to kidnap your own daughter. Am I right? Stop talking nonsense. You're a big shot with a meticulous plan... but I am just a pest controller who cracked your plan. You've gravely misunderstood me. Instead of killing me take me under your wing. It'll be useful to you. My friend Kathir has panned to kidnap your daughter to save his daughter. It's not profitable for me to be with him. Because he's a righteous man. You can't surpass him and kidnap your daughter. If he kidnaps your daughter before you do. All your plans will bite the dust. - Instead override his plan. - I don't get it. We will kidnap Shreya. And put the blame on him. 'I decided to make the ordinary man the villain in my story.' 'I started to override your plan.' 'You decided the time and date to kidnap my daughter.' Deva should not come to the school. It's your responsibility. I should not come to the school to pick up Shreya. It's your responsibility. 'I made a small correction in the plan.' 'I kidnapped the child before you stepped inside the school.' Now ask Kathiravan to go inside the school. Rudra, will definitely come to the school. And Kathiravan will get caught. 'You were at the school to kidnap a child who has been already kidnapped.' 'I called Rudra to get you caught.' 'As per plan you got caught.' 'Also Shreya was in our custody.' 'You did something that surprised me.' 'You told Rudra that you'll find my daughter.' 'I suspected that you and Madhan were going to double-cross me.' 'I followed everywhere you went.' 'It was confirmed that you were not going to double-cross me.' 'But I realized you started to play my game.' 'One by one, you started to crack down on my men.' 'You made me shoot my own men.' Sir, he's our man. Let's not do it. Shoot him! Shoot him! - Sir, he's our man. - I said shoot him. 'I could even forgive you for that.' 'But you made me save the 25 children that I kidnapped.' 'But I took advantage of it to get back with my wife.' 'Only when Rudra saved me from the Police I knew...' 'she didn't hate me but was only angry with me.' 'As the child trafficking was busted...' 'my aliases started to threaten me.' 'Asking to immediately return the money.' 'My only asset was my daughter Shreya.' 'I didn't want to lose Rudra's trust.' 'Also I needed the money.' 'For that I needed someone and that's you.' 'I kidnapped your daughter and brought you over here.' 'So, that you can call my wife and demand ransom.' Dad... I overrode your plan and turned you into a bad man and myself into a good man. Hey, enough listening to stories. No one here should stay alive. Including him. Why didn't you suspect that I'll kill you once everything is done? You trusted me, right? Daddy. Baby. Baby, don't worry. No one will harm you. Baby are you okay? Daddy is here to save you. Daddy, you're lying. I heard everything you spoke. You're bad! I'm surely going to tell mummy about it. You shouldn't tell, baby. You shouldn't! You shouldn't tell. Take her away. Tomorrow morning my daughter Shreya's corpse... will be at my doorstep. Rudra and I will be shattered. Rudra will be outraged 'cause you took the money and killed her daughter. Life long Rudra will be looking for you. I'll be responsible and take care of the business. I'll become the new Managing Director of RMR company. Tomorrow onwards all my dreams will come true. But my daughter... you put me in a situation where I have to kill my own daughter. Hey! Die! - Hey, where is he? - No idea, sir. Look for him. Hey, kill him! Hey! Dad! Come on! Dad... Come on! You fight well with just one leg. Now fight me. Come on! Dad! Come on! Dad! Dad! Listen, before you die... you should know why you're going to die. [laughing] I'm holding a gun. How would I die? 'I knew the 1st day I started following Shreya on my father's advice.' 'That I was not the only one who has been following, Shreya.' 'I asked Madhan to follow the boys.' 'Those boys took us to the RTM manager...' 'and the RTM manager lead us to you.' Kathir, it was Deva who has hired those boys to follow Shreya. 'Initially when Madhan said I didn't believe him.' 'Because my father said you're a hero.' 'But I witnessed it with my own eyes.' In your story, Deva is the hero. But actually, Deva is the villain. Then start your game with Deva. 'That's when I started my game.' 'I sent my friend to you and got you webbed in my plan.' 'And you made our plan easy.' When Deva arrives at the school... 'to block his car is not our only plan.' 'Inform Deva that I'll be kidnapping Shreya after school.' 'But our plan is to make Deva kidnap Shreya during the PT period.' 'You kidnapped Shreya.' 'You thought I'll get caught at the school.' 'My plan was to get caught at the school.' This courier should get delivered at Rudra's residence before I get caught. 'Similarly, after I get caught...' 'make sure Deva's men deliver Shreya's original dress at Rudra's residence.' Only then Rudra would believe that I did not kidnap, Shreya. 'I confused Rudra with Shreya's dress.' 'Rudra panicked!' 'I took advantage of the situation.' Madam! One minute! 'You would've never expected that Rudra asked me to find your daughter.' 'But I expected it.' 'To expose you and your gang to Rudra...' 'I played dumb by beginning the investigation at the school.' 'What followed later...' 'was diligently reported to Rudra by his bodyguard.' 'I made you kill your men.' 'Also I made you save the children you kidnapped.' 'I thought you'll get caught and that'll be the end of you.' 'But the next day you surprised me with your commendable performance.' 'That didn't just shake down Rudra but it shook me too.' 'I knew you'll set out to avenge me.' 'But I never expected that you'll kidnap my daughter who's struggling for her life.' 'You started using me to finish your job.' 'You made me demand ransom from Rudra.' 'Your men believed that I was trying to escape.' 'I profusely ran so that you should not escape.' 'The heart beat started racing.' 'Rudra's phone got an alert.' I'm not wearing the watch. How come I'm getting notification? Who's got my watch? 'By now Rudra must've tracked you down.' 'Your men caught me and brought me over here.' Make sure Deva's daughter listens to my conversation with Deva. 'So, you have to untie her before she regains consciousness.' 'RMR company's new Managing Director.' 'You think only your daughter heard our conversation.' 'But I made sure that Rudra too heard our conversation.' Listen to the voice note from your iWatch on your phone. 'Now Rudra knows who you are and what you have done.' What did you say? That you overrode my plan. My plan was to make you override my plan. 'If my calculation is right...' 'Rudra should've arrived.' 'And she must've picked up the gun I left for her.' A father like you don't deserve to stay alive. Die! How are you? I'm doing well. You came to Chennai for Magizh's education. After the incident you've returned to your home town. What about Magizh's education? For me Magizh's happiness is important. You have a point though. Did we entirely get out of the problem? No! I'm sure one day that AC will find and dig out Rudra's dead husband. Even if they find the corpse we won't get caught. It's Rudra who would get caught. Will Rudra give us up? It's 'cause of Rudra madam, my daughter is alive today. She won't get caught. Neither I let her get caught. In Deva's murder case they'd have to go past me before convicting Rudra. That's why... I left a clue behind. Are you serious? I don't understand. The story is not yet over. "O' dear, My precious" "Happy clouds above you" "O' dear, My precious" "Who can smile like you?" "When I became lonely And was about to leave this life" "You came as a green parrot And sat on my shoulders!"
