Thank you, my wife is about to arrive. In any case, thank you very much. Maybe another time. Come on Johann, I want to introduce you to some guests. I hope I don't delay. Doctor Meredith. - He will be your guide, Johann Biari. - Hello. - My wife. - Good night. - Speak English? - something. He speaks it well and will be a good guide. Well, do you think time will help us? - If we are lucky. I would like a simple tour at the beginning, For the first day. then, every day something more complicated. We'll talk about it after dinner. - Can you wait for us? - Sure, sir. Gracias. I thought you would tell her to sit down? That is not common here. then we'll have a drink with him. - What do you think about him? - What do you mean? If you find it nice. How to know? It will be a nice day tomorrow. The sky is clear. - This is for you. - Thank you. - I'm going up. Goodnight. - I'll be right away. Goodnight. Does your wife climb too? She's been rock climbing, but ice is new to her. It is the first time he has come to the Alps. And you? As a student, I made many trips to Mont Blanc. - But without a guide. - Then... Here is the hotel. Tomorrow we can go up and go to this cabin. It is an easy tour. - Good evening, Johann. - Good evening sir. - Peter Van Royen, the Amsterdam. — Douglas Meredith, the Glasgow. Are you going to hire Johann? Yes, we are talking about the tour. He is an excellent guide. there is no better one. I assure you. - Have you ever gone up with him? - More than once. Last year a whole month. He breaks all records. Scale with a stopwatch. I had to run from top to bottom. it cannot be said that it is mountaineering. That's why he pays double the fee. What's wrong? Right now, I am the happiest person. perfectly happy. And in the next instant I'm going to be completely sad. Sometimes I can't take it. I pray to God that I can help you bear it. Douglas! Who is she? - This is Kate. - Kate? Look. - Have you recognized me? - No, it's been 10 years. - You're the same person. - Yes I am, exactly the same. - This is Sarah, my wife. - Dear. What's happening? did i surprise you? Are you thinking of going back to India? It's not about that. Here I am not useful. In the last 3 years since my brother died You have been in front. This is one of the few shipyards that is still making a profit. And it's thanks to you, Maclean. Maybe you won't be able to run the shipyard, but it would be interesting. After all it is a family business. And it would be more profitable for both. I am a doctor. It is all that I know. And that's why I joined the medical practice In order not to interfere here. - That's reasonable, right? - The truth is not. You're going to do it anyway, whatever you want. Half of the shipyard is yours. You must take care of your part. Kate has the other half, does she take care of it? - If it does. - Is that true, Kate? Is it true what your mother says? I'm just a trainee in the design office. That is all. She would like an apple. - Come on help me. - Yes, that's fine. Do you think they are on their honeymoon? She is very young. I'm sure they're newlyweds. - Do you think that is correct, Johann? - What? For an old man to marry a young woman. poor girl. He has no right to do it. Good morning Doctor. Hello. Don't pay too much to the mountain guide. We abide strictly by the rate. That question is for Mr. Brendel who has negotiated for me. I know nothing. I hope it's not too generous. Guides should not charge much. - It isn't true? - Absolutely. - So, happy holidays! - Same thing. Good morning Johann, I have brought the rope. Oh, we don't need it today. We will review it later. Please take her to my room. Thanks. - This is for you. - Thank you. we walked 3, 4 hours. And then we'll eat something. In the afternoon we can be back. Along the way they can practice on a small rock. A small rock looks good to me Kate? Kate? Kate? Kate? Kate, where are you? Come say goodbye to Douglas. I will miss the train. Come on, Kate, otherwise the boat will go without me. What are you doing, Kate? Do not be silly. I won't be gone forever. Don't go to India. This is a small rock? On the other hand, it is much easier. But it is not difficult. Do you want to go up? Yes, why not? Ten. Mrs. Meredith? We are ready. - It's okay? - Yes, thank you. Take this. Now, Mrs. Meredith. Caution! Douglas! Quiet! - I enjoy it? - Not much. Come on doctor. - Do you like the view? - Yes, a lot. It is my pleasure to climb with you, sir. - You do it very well - Thank you. It was also for me. - Is it as beautiful as the Himalayas? - Is different. Have you been there? Yes, in 1924 on the Everest expedition. I thought I had climbed only in Europe. I was mainly as a doctor then as a climber Yes, but it's still an honor. The Doctor is very modest. - What's that? - It could be lightning. A storm. Let's go. - And the peaks? - They can attract lightning. I go for the peaks. As soon as your husband arrives, we will go down. No, thanks. We will probably be the last visitors this year. Who knows? What are you doing here in winter? Not much.

It is a pleasure. Again a doctor. What's funny? Last year I went up with another doctor. That he couldn't climb. I had to carry it to the top. You can't carry a man on the mountain. - Sometimes we have to. - Charge someone? Johann asked me if he had to do it with you. - Oh, that's not true. - It's true. That's common. Yes Douglas. This is a very simple technique. Come here. Douglas! - Douglas! - We crossed to the other side. Douglas, bajame. Douglas, I'm not 10 anymore. Thanks, Johann. We enjoy it. Even the weather. Gracias. We leave at 4:00 in the morning, okay? We will need the crampons and carbines.

Who are these people you are going to go climbing with? Friends of Douglas from Paris. Yes ok. But who are they? Friends from the time he was in India. I don't know them. Are there people your age?

It is an interesting mountain not too complicated. This is why I came. We can go up the west side. Then we will have two routes to go down. The first is the most used. they are good rocks. The other route is shorter, but much more difficult. You have to cross those steep ridges. Then it goes down that rather interesting spire. They call her the maiden. It will cost you 50 francs more. And for Mrs. Meredith it's too heavy. I love these slippers. And what will they do tomorrow? I think, it will be interesting. Really something big. - It's hard? - Unfortunately, yes. - Too complicated for me? - Absolutely. What do you think, Johann? It's pretty tough. It would not be interesting for you.
