I'm grateful for the river that brings all friends to gather here. I, Phraya Decho, want to mark this auspicious occasion to hold an international trade show or widely known to us as "The Expo". To show that we welcome everyone, we will build the world's largest carp! Our Sri Ayothaya Maha Kongka Nakorn known as U-Ta by villagers or "living by the river." This riverside has been peaceful for hundreds of years. Why is it? Rumor has it there is a mysterious elite military force called Uttamart. that protects the kingdom. There have been no invaders so far. Once, Chiang In sent out an army of shaman, hoping to defeat the Uttamart with black magic. Not only did he lose, his eye was gouged out. Nobody really knows if this is true since no one has ever seen the Uttamart. But I strongly believe that they are real. I believe that my father is one of them. People say that I brag. Well, I actually do. I can't even remember my father's face. 'Cause I have amnesia. Anyway, U-Ta has always been peaceful. Everyone wants to build their lives here. They say at U-Ta, you can be anyone that you want to be. I've always had this dream of being someone in uniform. Finally, today, my dream has come true. CHECKPOINT Hold it there. Stop. Stop! Give me 50 bia. The authorities are on high alert for the big gig. You can be arrested for being wasted, you know? Beat it! Hey, Petch. Shit. Have you been drinking? What a weird question! No, I have not. -Then blow this. -I refuse. I didn't drink. There. There. -Ouch! -Is there a problem here? Why don't I recognize you guys? What's the deal? Did you blow it or not? Sir. Sir. Petch, let's go. Are you a human torch blower? Bullshit! I'm not drunk, but arrested. This guy is tricky. He's drinking buffalo's milk, so that he won't get detected. You are not drunk. That one is cunning. Chewing guava leaves, won't be caught. Who's gonna pay us the fine then? Ah, found one! I'll take everything he has. Blow! Whoa. Did you eat shit? Get out of here! Go. Enough! Enough, enough! Where are you going? -My husband's ordination. -Whose husband? You too, granny? All right, just let me check that. Wow. What's this? You said you didn't drink? Sticky rice in bamboo. Whoa, steaming out of your mouth. Just help us out. Hope I won't go to hell. Bye-bye. Let's go. See you, ladies. Where are you going? Why did you paint your face? I'm an acrobat-magician. The authority hired me to perform. What do you have here? Any illegal stuff? You can be arrested. But we can arrange something. How about you? Are you really a policeman? Hey! Insulting officers, that's another offence. -Sir. -Sir. We got mugged. They stole our uniforms, boss. There! Those two. They stole our uniforms. -Yeah. There. Over there. -Let's go, Petch. Go. There they are! Hit the gong, call for the patrol unit. Faster! -Petch. -Hey! Stop! Stop now! Stop or I'll shoot. Shit, Kaew! I have a passkey. Kaew, faster! Hey! If you make it, tell my mom I love her. Petch, you are an orphan! They are shooting! Bastard! How could a dead guy scream? Holy shit! Damn it. What now? Get rid of them. Hey. Help me. Kick it. We have to jump now, Petch. Jump, my ass, Kaew. You first. Let's do it together. Iâ€™m glad I have you, my friend. Off you go, Petch. Damn you, Kaew. What did you do? I nearly had a heart attack. How do you control the horses? Hey. Hey! I can't see anything. To the left. Left. Left. Stop! I said stop. Hey, Petch. Watch out! Hey. You left me! Stop! If you don't stop, I'll shoot! We are screwed! Help me! KHUN PHAEN BEGINS Remember me? Phraya Decho... Look at what you've done. It's time for my revenge. Let's see how U-Ta holds up without you. It's an impersonator. Low level spell from the Uttamart. Let me make it up to you. Please forgive me. I will get the real Phraya Decho next time. There will be a huge celebration. A lot of guests will arrive from many kingdoms. One of them can be Prince Pintong, who is expected to be crowned as the new king of Lanchang. He might come. They are all cowards. The Uttamart only hide. Good. I'll push for the war soon. Rasami-Sichan, Moong Kayong, you are trained to be weapons. If there's no war, we are worthless. Get the Prince. And destroy the celebration. When I have the Prince, we'll use him to ignite the war. I want to see if the Uttamart can still hide then. Here comes a pretty boy Kaew, the elegant Poor as a peasant Trying to build his life Best friend is Petch Joseph Sae Kow Helping me row a boat We come from Suphan Buri To U-Ta to find our dreams Going after our dreams In a civilized place We only live once I'm here to make my dreams come true I won't give up My heart says this is the right place This is the place I dreamed of Is this place real?

Chang, Pim, let's get back on the stage. People are booing. Okay. Well then... Let's go. Come, Pim. -This is better. -What is it? Hey! Where did you get this? I snatched it during the fight. Let's go then. -The prisoners escaped. -Get back. Kaew, since when do you have a celebrity friend? Hey, run. Run. -What's wrong? Hey. Hey. Hey. -Get them! Tell me, son. What do you see when you look at this tree? I see a tree killed by the thunder. Look at the treetop. You see? A young shoot is growing. The thunder didn't cause its death, but its revival. Tri dewa-rung Maha Sastra. Traitor's son! Get him! Traitor's son! Chang! Pim. Kaew, do you believe in ghosts? Speak of the devil... Petch. Don't be scared, but I think we have company. Hey! Take off your pants, pretty boy. Hey, Pee Pleaw. Pee Pleaw, is it really you? I'm so glad you are not dead. -I'm Keaw. -Keaw? My grandmother is from your mom's side of family, but most people think I'm from my dad's sibling's. But never mind... Your mother asked me to tell you she still believes in you and will love you always. I've heard about you from your mom with love and honesty. Mom. Mom. Your mom... Thank you, bro, for bringing me the message. Petch, don't you be scared. I've settled it with my brother already. Those aren't your brothers. Ghosts. Shit! Kaew. Hello. Where did he go? Why are you hysterical? I'm a human being, not a ghost. Don't tell me that. -That dog was you? -Yes. All right. My name is Det. AFFORDABLE AND EFFECTIVE MAGIC AND CHANTING LESSON. The powerful Red Beard Wizardous Det, or Det, The Warlock. Have you ever heard of me? Nope. I saw those three prisoners getting dragged to their execution. You talked to them so casually. I have only seen ghosts trick humans. This is the first time I saw a human trick ghosts. It's you that I've been looking for. -I like it! Like it! Like it! -Hey! Hey. I have come here to find talent, the ones with potential. I have failed so far. You must be one of those outlaw shamans. You are stuck here because you cheated people, right? Don't you want to know who your father is? You know my father? It doesn't matter who your father is. What matters is who you really are. First things first, the basic knowledge. You have to study it yourself. Second, this jail is not suitable for teaching. You have to take me out of here. I can't even save my own ass, let alone helping-- It's just that you can help me. Hey! Kaew, Petch. You can leave now. Someone bailed you out. Petch. Petch. Hey. Let's go. Come on, get up. -Out! -Okay. Go. -Hurry up. -Let's go, Petch. Ohm, I call you to possess. Hey! Kaew. You were already bailed out. Hasn't anyone opened the gate? I heard that Prince Pintong will travel with his closest advisors privately. Infiltrate and try to get close to the Prince. Steal gunpowder to sabotage the celebration. You can go. Kaew. When will you stop getting yourself in trouble? You know we are not like others. If something happened, we would be in trouble. It's hard enough for me to raise you all by myself. Don't cause any more trouble. Mom. -Mom. -What? Who is my father? How come you never tell me about him? Why do we have to live like this? Why doesn't he take care of us? Your father is a good man. Just remember that. It doesn't matter who your father is. What matters is who you really are. Now you want to learn my magic, don't you? "Decha Wittaya Akom." No shit! Welcome to the world of magic. What do you want to learn? Come. Hey. Manao. Manao. Jittung Jetasikang Roopung Nimittang kumarung. Kuman Thong, my son! You should dress properly. We have a guest. You always sneak out. And the good stuff is still here. Why didn't you eat? Always banana, sugar cane, and boil egg. Boring. Who is this kid? Be nice. Now go to work. You have treats? Next time, fatty. Welcome to the room of magic. "Seven world-class magic tricks. by Gandalf, translated by Master Det." Is this genuine? Of course. It's not fake. Please sit. Thank you. Show him, son. Please. Many people have asked what magic is. Let me put it this way. Everything on Earth comes from tiny things put together called molecules. The human body is the same. To enter the state of concentration and to control your mind, you have to cause the vibration of those small dots that creates a force called Pran. Pran is used to create magical forces in the world. Each mantra works differently. If you want to learn about Pran, follow me. Manao, bring me the scripture. And can your magic bring back my memory? I want to see my dad just once. The scripture in your hand is a human skin scripture. It holds spirits and skins of supreme masters from nine different branches. Nobody has ever finished all nine branches. The first spell is teleportation. -Satta rattanapagarung Amma Hakung. -When you cast this spell, -you can go anywhere you please... -Saranung Kacha mi. ...or meet anyone you want. But you haven't learned to control... -Surarachachasoesoe. -...and to focus, so don't cast the spell. -Namo Bhudaya... -Or you will... We are damned. Hey, Pim. That handsome boy from the other day, who was he? Your old flame? What old flame, Saitong? He is my childhood friend. We were very close, but I think he has forgotten me. He doesn't seem to remember me. Are you keeping him for yourself? I thought I'd ask you to introduce me to him. Come on, let's go. BATHROOM 2 Guests at the celebration will go to Pim's Fabric for measurements. The security seems to be flawed. Blend in with the western ambassadors. This is your second chance. Bring Phraya Decho to me. You can't fail this time. What are you doing, young man? Want to bathe together? Sorry, you are not my type. Hi, Kaew. We meet again. Let me get changed, and we can go get something to eat. Hey, don't leave. Wait here. Okay. You are a member here? So cute. Kaew! What brings you here? Wait right there, I'm coming. Welcome, friend. Please come in. Come on, Kaew. Pim. Kaew. -Come. -My son, Chang was sent to study with a family from Holland, so his accent sounds slightly like theirs. Please forgive me for interrupting. Who is this? This is Kaew, Aunt Theptong. When we were young, he lived next door. You poor boy. With a past like yours... You'll jinx yourself by saying that, Sri Prachan. Is it a jinx? I was not thinking clearly. What's wrong with me? You are a traitor's son. Your dad, Kun Krai, was a traitor. He brought shame to all our noblemen. What are you doing here? Don't tell me you plan to steal from us. Mom! As a traitor's son, you can't serve anyone. You're not a commoner, can't even be a slave. But he is my friend. Well, then, ask your friend to introduce himself. Who he is and where he's from. My name is Kaew, sir. Yes, I'm an outlaw like you said. I can't remember my childhood. I must thank all of you for letting me know who I am. This is tomato. That looks delicious. You should try all of them. The sauce looks great. I haven't tried it. You should eat tomatoes every day. It's good for your skin. Chang, come with me. The ambassador wants to talk to you. Yes, father. Kaew! Kaew. Let me apologize on behalf of my mom for calling you a thief. Whatever you are, you are still our friend. You'll never steal from me. Very well then. We shouldn't hurry back home. There's so much to talk about. Where should we go? I'll take you there. Chang seems to enjoy it. You forgot the time when we were kids? Since you disappeared, my family made me get engaged to Chang. But at least he is a gentleman. He asked me if I wanted to be with him and he waited for my answer. After he came back from abroad, he proposed to me. I... I'm happy for you. People gossip that I want his wealth. So he enlisted in the military, went against his dad's wishes to prove that he is just a man who loves a woman. If it were me, I would do the same. Enlist in the military? I'm an outlaw. They wouldn't take me. Let me handle that matter. Sarge Petch, at your service. Since when did you become a soldier? I'm a soldier who protects the kingdom. And I have... always liked a man in uniform. The Expo firework show is coming up. Let's go see it. I'll be back. Kaew. It doesn't hurt to try. Don't you want to protect anything? Nope. Pim! Let's watch the fireworks. Kaew, let's go. Kaew. Kaew. Wake up. Kaew. Mom, I'm going to join the military. Don't worry about me. Krai, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Those with strong bodies... ARMY RECRUITMENT ...will join Fox Unit. Those with stamina will join Wild Boar Unit. Hey, Kaew. I'm losing confidence. You said your friend would help? -He said he'd come. He'll come. -Hey! Stop chatting already. Are you volunteering? And the two of you, which clan are you from? Your clan, master? They are serving in my family. If you vouch for them like this, Chang, everything will be fine. If you've already enlisted yourself, then come. -Right. -Why are you standing there? Five cubits and two rice grains in height. Chest, two cubits and one span width. Wild Boar. Strong. Healthy, strong... Fox. Take your uniform. Petch. Don't look strong. Pretend to be weak, so that they send us to a lousy unit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Next. Step forward. Yes. You seem eligible. Good. Five cubits and one span height. Nice figure. Hey. What's wrong with you? I have chronic cough. Damn it! Get out, you wimp. Next. Thank you. Is this your hair or a steel brush? Damn! It's real. Scumbag. Skinny as a rail! Go. Go. Go. You wimp, go! Take your uniform. Be more energetic! Attention! Welcome, volunteers. We still need more of the young force to support our kingdom. No matter who you are or where you are from, from now on, you will be called only one thing. You are soldiers of Sri Ayothaya Maha Kongka Nakorn. Salute. Attention! Hey. Hello. My name is Ram. My dad's name is Sati. My mom's name is Feung. I enlisted to join the Ordinance Battalion. Never thought I'd meet morons like you. Nice to meet you. -Yeah. -Likewise. Hey. You three morons, do you remember me? I'll see you later. All recruits, focus. Start! Damn. Why are you so brutal? Left, right, left. Left, right, left. It's midnight. It's midnight. It's midnight. Why did you stop? What are you looking at? Kaew. Hey, Meun Jarmon. Shit, what a poser. Uncle. Have you heard of the 35 Uttamarts? The secret unit that gathered the elite warlocks? Why wouldn't I? Do you know them? Do they really exist? I'm just a low-level shaman. How would I know them? Why do you want to know? I just want to know how are they able to live to protect others without being seen. I have no idea. Uncle. How do you think the world will remember me? It's up to you, how you want them to remember you. All right, come and learn. The five subjects are the fundamentals of meditation to develop and control the Pran stream. You must be focused, not get distracted. When your Pran is strong, you can use it with magic spells. INVISIBILITY, MEMORY, MAHA RARUAY, TELEPORTATION This dude is from China. He took a boat all the way here. Did you get sunburned? I see why you look so familiar. I used to see you at the dock. I know that you are a swindler. I prefer to call it cultural exchange. Trading, you know? -Trading? -What the hell is trading? Damn, you guys are simpletons. Here, I have something to show you. A telescope. Wow! You know, you can see the stars above. Wow. I have another piece. The Take-Down-An-Elephant Ant. One bite, and even an elephant collapses. I got this from a westerner's brig. Said this type of ant comes from Africa. What type? It's fatal. Be careful. -It got out! -Shit! Lights out! Lights out! Put out the fire. -Damn it. -Go to sleep. Quick, all of you. Damn it. Wake up. Wake up. Will you sleep until you rot? Soldiers can't be lazy. -Shit! -Hey. These morons wake up late. Wake up! Wake up! Pack up your stuff. Move it! Move it! Falling asleep while standing? -Are you up? -Yes, sir. I'm up. Fifty squats. Now. -One. -Louder! Two. Three. -With harmony! -Four. -Yeah! -Five. -Soldiers must be strong. -Shit. Faster. Keep counting. -Six. -Yeah! -Seven. -Yeah. -Eight. -Faster. Nine! -Sir. -Keep squatting. -Ten. -Want more? -Sir. -Keep squatting. Eleven. -With harmony! -Twelve. -Louder. -Thirteen. Sir, that ant-- Ant? Then what? Shit. Shit. Sir. -Shit! -Hey! Get the ant! Are you sure, Kaew? Release it, Kaew. Privates! Whoever comes late, cleans the toilets! -Hey. Hey. -Quickly! All, stand up! Petch, Ram, I have a secret code. When I say "Mother Yoi," you answer "Cheab Cheab," okay? Then we run. Why Mother Yoi? And why Cheab Cheab? It's the secret code. -Remember it. -Strong. Patient. Agile. Move it. Faster. Climb. Mother Yoi! Cheab Cheab. Kaew. Your "Mother Yoi, Cheab Cheab" plan is very good. -Yeah. -It really works. -So yummy. -Ram. -Share some with your friends. -Of course. You take the wing. Delicious, huh? -Shit! -Shit! Shit! Others are training their asses off. What are you doing here? All three of you, go clean the toilet, now! Yes, sir! Hey. What are the girls doing in the boot camp? They are preparing for the performance at the giant carp show. In two days, the guests will come here for measurements. And I heard that they will assign new soldiers for security. How do you know so much? Why don't I? I smell shit. Here. Three of them. What shit? Shitheads. Losers. Shithead losers. Hey! I can't brush off this piece of shit! -Want a fight? -You want a fight? You want more? -Hey, why did you do that? -You want it too? Really? Take this! Grab him. Sutta Ratana Namo Bhudaya. What is your shitty spell? Kick their asses! Damn losers. Let's go. Seems like you're not ready. Back to practice. Those who train Pran need a strong body. Your muscles are as soft as a baby's ass. Again. Stretch your arm out. That's right. The biceps... -See your biceps? -Master... -Work your shoulders. -Master! -What? -What are you doing? Nothing. Keep practicing. Manao, go play somewhere else. This is Chan's house. A widow ghost. Dead for more than a week. It's high time you use her to train your enchantment spell. Manao. Hurry. Kaew, watch me. I'll show you how. Ohm Raruay Maha Raruay... so enchanted by love and lust. You came back to me now, shit-face husband! Hubby! Ohm Raruay Maha Raruay... So enchanted by love and lust. Sitting, waiting at the entrance by the window, can't sleep from missing Piyang Ma. Ohm Raruay Maha Raruay, so enchanted by love and lust. sitting, waiting at the entrance by the window can't sleep from missing Piyang Ma. Ohm Raruay Maha Raruay, so enchanted by love and lust. -Sitting, waiting at the entrance by-- -Kaew. What spell are you reciting? Ram and I are about to make love. Stop trying to turn me on! Hey! What are you doing? Hey! Please take care of all the ambassadors, Pim. They trust you. Yes, sir. -Hello. How are you? -I'm fine. This is my second wife. This is Phraya Decho. He's in charge here. -Hello. -Hello. -May I? -Yes. -What is it? -A massage machine. Okay. -Are you comfortable? -Yes. -Did I hit the spot? -Very much. Let me rub your ears. What are you doing? Hypnotizing spell. Damn. You see? He is falling asleep. That's great, Kaew. Hey, Ram. How is this tool? Ram, you said they had volunteers here to help. I've been massaging since morning. It's smelly and tiring. I'm pissed off! Bastard. I got piss all over my feet. You asshole. That damn westerner speaks Thai so well. You were too rough with him. Hey! One of you, come help us move stuff. I'll go. Two spans. For ankles, nine. Can I go for a walk? Yes. Hey! Shit! Can we play something else? It's just a pretend wedding. Just for fun. Nothing serious. Or you are serious? No, I'm not. Do you promise to honor and cherish her for the rest of your life? Kaew. Kaew. Now what? When I ask you if you promise to honor and cherish her for the rest of your life, you have to say "I do." I do. -Kaew! -Hey. Pim. How did you get in here? Don't you know sneaking into this quarter can result in severe punishment? So beautiful. Thanks. I mean the fabric. This. Did you draw it all by yourself? I only designed it. It's really beautiful. I like... Fabric? I mean you. Thanks. Right. Check this room. That piece of fabric looks familiar, like I've seen it before. You said you have amnesia. I remember some things. You look handsome in the uniform. Wait until I wear the full uniform, I'll look even more handsome. I heard that training is very hard. Don't you run away again this time. Come on. If I become a Phraya one day, I'll come back and order you to mop the floor. Don't brag too much, Kaew. Will you wait for me? You should go. The guards will come back. Chang. Well, I slept and I woke up... They asked me to find you. Any later than this, you'll be punished. I should get going. Chang. What is it? Do you know that after the training, they give you an honorable uniform for the best soldier? I will take it for you as a wedding gift. Well, I better go now. All soldiers, partner up for sword training. Soldiers from the same unit are not permitted to partner up. Be strong. Focus. Begin! Kaew. Will you be my partner? Come, Chang. You should train more, Kaew, if you want us to compete. Love is always like this, right? What do you know about love? Why not? I like a woman as well. You like a foreigner? What a charming girl. When she smiles, her tongue drops down to the floor. Go up. Go. Shit. Ohm Maha Raruay, so enchanted by love and lust. -Uncle. -Huh? What now? Too naughty. Just let her enjoy the moment, and she'll be reborn soon. Let's go, Nao. Good luck, Kaew. Bye-bye. The camouflage spell will allow you to hide from enemies. Nabangmoyang Bhudana Protect. That is still sloppy. Is this still sloppy, uncle? It hit me right on the head. What you've learned so far is just the half of it. If you want to be the best necromancer, you should be able to control the ghouls. Summon them to us. I'll use the burning eyes spell. Manao, light the candle. Hey, look for it. That's strange. I smell them, but cannot see them. Hey, Manao. Manao? When will you light the candle? Manao! Light them! No candle, what will I light? No candle What should we do? What the... This is not a time for singing. Manao! Light the damn candle! I have a candle, I got the candle Your candle is at my neck You want to test me? I'll lock you in a pot forever. -Master. -Huh? -There is only one pot. -And? -There are two ghouls. -Huh? Hey! Don't get yourself killed. It's safe in here. My husband, come back to me. I've been waiting for you. Hey, I am your husband. -Husband! -You have an affair with my wife, I'll break your neck. But you divorced me. -No, I did not. -You don't own me. What should we do? In this case, we use blessed rice. Maybe it's expired. Dang! Anyway, I'll take Kaew with me. Husband, your wife is really hurt. Come to me. -Get over me. I'm not your type. -Husband... These two are wicked. Manao, let's call for back up. You got it. I can't take it anymore. Husband... I've had enough! Right before my eyes. -Manao, help me! -You flirty ghoul. Husband... Contemplation is the key. It connects the human, Pran, and the universe. So you have to focus. One, two. Make it five. And push! Push! To the front. Push to the front. Is this all you can do after months? -Look! -Here. Look at Kaew. Sutta Ratana Pakarung Umha Hakang Saranang Katchami... Wait! What? Wait for what? Coward like a chicken. Go on, Kaew. Do your best.

Kaew did it! Awesome. Soldiers, bring the horse into captivity. Son! Theptong, this is not your scene. Back off. You lost today, didn't you? I didn't send you abroad to study just to come back and be a low-level soldier. You must become an honorable noble because I've chosen the best for you. Leave now. Because you are Kun Sri Wichai We got lucky! I sang that. Sir. Sir The news about the lost gunpowder is spreading among the ambassadors. Keep this information from everyone to prevent panic. Keep the foreigners confident during this celebration of our kingdom. There must be a mole. That's why the warehouse was plundered. I will find the culprit right away. Yeah, good. What is my son's fate? Your son has a huge threat. His life is about to perish. Kaew. Kaew, my son. Isn't your son's name Fueang? Joi, get me a new bowl. Kaew's fate is the fate of a great man. That means it's good, right? Before becoming a great man, fate will stomp on him. It is up to on your son, if he will stand and fight or stay under the foot of destiny. Congratulations to all the new soldiers who finished the training of the Volunteer Force. Good job. But don't be disappointed. Big positions await you, nephew. Yes, sir. And I promote Private Kaew to chief officer of the security unit in the upcoming expo. Congratulations. Attention! Face right! Salute! Pim. I'd like to show you this. This uniform... I did as promised. This honorable uniform, they only give it to the best soldier. What are you thinking? Chang told me that he wanted this uniform, too. I don't know how he feels now. Namo Puttung, forget about the past. Now there's only you and me. Where were we again? We were talking about this... Apart from military training, I have training in magic as well. You said you'd like to see my Kuman Thong. -Yeah? -Yes. Want to see him now? Kuman Thong, my son. Come. Come here. Why are you so fat? Fat, my a-- Don't listen to him. He didn't say anything. Don't. Little one, what can you do? You'll see. I will take you flying into space There's only you, don't be afraid I will take you flying into danger There's only you, don't be afraid Love won't make you fall Love makes you love Are you tired? Let's rest before I take you flying Love won't make you fall Love makes you love Are you tired? Let's rest before I take you flying I will take you flying into space There's only you, don't be afraid I will take you flying into danger There's only you, don't be afraid It's weird. Why do I think there are only two of us in the world? But I like it. Namo Puttung, forget about everything tonight. Where were we again? I was telling you that I'm about to leave. Pim. Chang. I couldn't keep my promise. I must be just like what my dad said. For something so small, I've already disappointed you. Chang. You are the smartest and the best person for me. Not once have you disappointed me. Will you still marry me? Yes. I love you. Petch, Ram! Private Kaew, can you tell me, before you enlisted, what clan did you come from? Kaew, just admit that you lied. Kun Sri Wichai told me you do not serve in any clan. Admit it. You are an outlaw. You belong to no clan. You don't deserve this honorable uniform. Kaew falsely claimed that he served Kun Sri Wichai and enlisted in the Volunteer Force. He is convicted with a serious crime and is released from the Volunteer Force. Petch and Ram are suspected as accomplices. They are released from the force as well. Take their uniforms. Prohibit them from coming close to the capital at any cost. Cheers. You are not strong enough, Kaew. You better come back with me to continue your training. Uncle. I think... I don't want to learn anything anymore. If you go with the flow, you are just a dead fish. Someone like you should swim against the stream, Kaew. Do you know? Defeating anything else is not as important as defeating the fear in your heart. If you change your mind, just let him know. Take care of Manao. Don't let him go hungry. I better go. Car for hire! Car for hire. Stop, stop, stop. Where are you going? To the pier at Wat Yai. Can't go, I gotta turn in the vehicle. Car for hire! Fine, I'll walk. Ram, I want to pee. U-Ta-Suphan U-Ta-Suphan line is leaving. U-Ta-Suphan line is leaving. That's Meun Jarmon. What is he doing here looking suspicious? Tomorrow, Phraya Decho will come for an official visit at the market around the T junction. The security won't be too strict. You can reach him easily. Ram. Those two look familiar. I will lead the way for you to take Phraya Decho's life. Shit. Did you handle the Expo? Don't worry. I arranged the performances. When the kite tied with explosives flies into the sky, at that time, you can ignite the explosives to kill Prince Pintong. When U-Ta is in Chiang In's control, you will get everything you want. Oh, hey. Are you coming? -Are you coming? -Yes. -Kaew! -Kaew! Wait up. You go ahead. Okay. What's wrong? Something's gonna happen. I'm not going. I'll go back to Suphan. You told me yourself that this is not our place. He is right, you know? Hey, but this is a good opportunity for us to go back and prove ourselves. Who wants to come with me? Fine, I'll go. Today, I wish you happiness, wealth and good luck on your new year. Now it's time to start the celebration. Hey! Stop. It's him. Charge! Protect Phraya Decho! Get the traitor! Get the traitor. He tried to kill Phraya Decho. Get the traitor. He tried to kill Phraya Decho. Stand down. Petch! Put it down. -Petch! -Run, Kaew. Stop, traitor! Get the traitor! Traitor! Get him! Traitor's son! Traitor's son. Get him! -Kaew! Where are you going? -Get him! Find him. He must be around here. Found him! Sutta Ratana Namo Bhudaya. Those mangoes look delicious. All right, Pim. Kaew! Traitor's son! Execute him. Stop! Chang! Tell me, son. What do you see when you look at this tree? I see a tree killed by the thunder. Look at the treetop. You see? A young shoot is growing. The thunder didn't cause its death, but its revival. Ohm Ma-a-oo Atikamurang Tri dewa-rung Maha Sastra Oo-oo-a-a Mama-mantra. Remember, Kaew. Heaven doesn't determine your fate. You yourself have to choose which path you want for your life. One day, the sword will help you find the truth. Then, you will have have to decide for yourself why you want to pick up this sword. From this day on, you will forget all about me. Father! How do you think the world will remember me? You are an outlaw. You have no clan. Someone like you should swim against the stream. Whatever you are, you'll always be our friend. Don't you want to protect anything? Today, you all will meet your demise. -Kaew! -Kaew! Let's protect our motherland. There, the burglars! They look like the pictures. That guy too. -Let's go. Don't follow us. -And that one! And the horse too. THE CELEBRATION You know, Prince Pintong always keeps his cool. He is the best, isn't he? Prince Pintong from Lanchang Kingdom has arrived. Please be seated on your throne up there, Your Grace. Let the show begin. Please enjoy the show from the Japanese community with a samurai sword, forged at the top of Mount Fuji. Whoa, that's magnificent. Please enjoy the cannon performance from the west. Moreover, we have a new invention from the westerners. -It's called... -Present it to him. ...the remote tin can telephone. Hello? Hello? I can hear a voice. Excuse me. Can you bring this tool to the beautiful lady over there? Not that one. No. The beautiful one. That one. That's right. Your Grace. Beautiful girl, where are you from? Why are you so beautiful? Your skin is so fine. It makes me want to meet your parents. Will you join me for tea? If you really love Chang, you must serve Pintong well. If he is unsatisfied, be it physically or mentally, it will have an impact on Chang's future directly. Remember. Beautiful girl, can you move over here? Why, Your Grace? So that our hearts are aligned. So refreshing. Your Grace, can you stop singing for a moment? The show is about to start. Please enjoy the Bian Lian show from Sichuan. Explosives are tied to the kite. Pim. Hey, let's go. Hey, that way! Attack! The thread, the thread! Help me, Kaew. Ram, hold it. -Ram! -I'm losing grip. One, two, three. That's awesome. We did it. Let's go. Let's go! Go! May I excuse myself for a minute, Your Grace? Sure. I also have a personal matter to attend to. Don't follow me. Yes, Your Grace. Pim, how are you? Where are you? Where are you hiding? Beautiful girl. -Honey. -Don't let him see us. Left or right? Where are you? Baby? What are you doing? What should we do now? Go tell Chang and the soldiers that Pintong was kidnapped. I will follow them. No, Pim. It's too dangerous. If anything happens to him, Chang will be dead. Pim! Chang! Chang. We have a situation. Kaew needs our help. Manao, let's go warn him. His love is in danger. Papa, Pim is in danger. -Pim. -Where is she? Pim is in danger. You guys wait here. -Hey! -Kaew. What is wrong with him? Go. Pim! Chang. Kaew! Chang. Pim, run! Let me see how good an ex-Chief Officer of U-Ta can be. Show me your best. Namo Bedazzle. You are sloppy, man. You will die without getting a chance to draw the sword. I'm not good at drawing my sword. But at drawing others', I'm the best. If this is what the best soldier of U-Ta can do, just accept your fate. Never talk too much while fighting. Chang! Pim! Pim! Where the hell are Decho and the Uttamart? Never thought the Yodia would send mediocre people. You'll see. Sutta Ratana Namo move around... Shit indeed! Kaew. Mother Yoi! Cheab cheab! Now, Ram! Pim! Pim! Kaew! Santri Petchkla, you lousy warlock. Didn't you want to find me? Right. I'll get my best revenge, Phraya Decho. Thana Kamola Petanang Attikayekaya Yaya Dewanung Piyatang Suttawa Itipiso Bhakava Yamarajano Lord Wessuwanno Moranung Sukhung Arahung Sukhato Namo Bhudaya You damn bastard! You want a piece of me? Protect the Prince. Secure the perimeter. Yes, sir! Oh, my goodness! Prince Pintong. Are you all right? What happened, Your Grace? This bastard kidnapped me. Damn! So cool! And you defeated him all by yourself? Yeah! That's right. I'm injured a little bit. Where, Your Grace? On my torso. I'm not sure if my liver is still intact. Can you stretch, so we can see? Stretch more. More. Jot it down. On the full moon of the second month, Year of Naga, Prince Pintong, the crown prince of Dan Chang, defeated the wizardous traitor named Santri Petchkla from Chiang In until he perished. It's an event to be archived in history. What will you do with your life? Very well, I wish you luck. U-Ta might need your service in the future. Farewell, sir. I'm sure your dad would be proud. Kaew. Pim wants to meet you at the lotus reservoir tomorrow at noon. You must be there. I NEVER FORGET Namo Puttang, forget everything tonight. I'm here to say goodbye to you. So this is the path you choose? Yes. This is what your dad wanted to give you on the day that you made your choice. Go, Kaew. Go make the change. Yes, Luang Por. Want to know where I'm going? Come with me then. Your son, he will make a full recovery. He'll be okay. If Chang recovers, I think we should have an auspicious ceremony to welcome him and get rid of bad luck. Arrange for an engagement and a wedding ceremony right away. There's one case I cannot cure.
