awesome at least tell me why those men out there want to kill me and why you're going to let them i got no legal right to stop your new arrival any citizen can kill you and get credit for the kill that is if it's a fair fight we know that you started it offered a provocation exactly because you do have the right to defend yourself you kill a citizen first if you can and you become a citizen and you get all the citizen drugs right to kill somebody equal opportunity i just don't understand what the hell you're talking kill or be killed what is it with you people why does everything come down to murder why is everything killed you killed why [Music] who did i ever i never killed anybody someone's got it yeah [Music] what if i don't [Music] i don't need credit for the kill and i'll kill you anyway it's long look i'm sorry i really am sorry figured you had the possibilities if you'd only put your nose clean until you learned which end was up for the last time get out no not that way ronto

mind we ain't going to bother you oh yeah we don't shoot folks for fun just for profit you bet we are nothing against you we was just doing our jobs well uh what kind of work you boys do work now we're body guards [Music] you ought to get out of that outfit for some other citizen makes play for you flint's got some new duds ought to fit you fine yeah everything that poor bastard head is yours now [Music] including the target on the back of this shirt better than slaves rags how about something in between i got shot keeper over there you ain't no shopkeeper boss [Music] that's one coin you're gonna lose not if i can help it happy you know as well as i do it's against principles personal interference that's a foul you have no right to program yourself into this game all i did was to extend the possibilities psychosexual overtones are pre-programmed by the supervisor not me not you don't be so damn silly lyle please don't lecture me about principles you should know by now that everything that happens in the game plan happens for a reason don't suck all right [Music] if you two don't mind restraining yourselves on the department's time perhaps i might have your interim analysis oh well not funny i'm getting a lot of static from the head of the project we are constantly late with our interim reports and they don't like it now really that's hardly fair our team does the most complex game plans does the head expect miracles exactly miracles seriously you two do understand we've got to have results we need survivors we need them desperately if i could get on with my work sir come on this way doc [Music] i killed the dentist you sure did you hit it lucky you drilled the right guy i don't think the last employer would think so [Music] now we was taken by surprise we didn't know you had a shooter shooter oh yeah did you see where that gun came from too busy looking after my own sweet hide to see anything same here what about the woman you see her do yourself a favor forget about that one and he did see her no i'm sorry don't think i did [Music] by the way uh just out of curiosity since you're so good what's to keep you from killing me and going to business for yourselves it's against the law for bodyguard to kill his own boss we're not animals you know no sir we're honest loyal fast on the draw you only take 25 percent of the profits that's fair isn't it [Music] all right miss you want to talk to louis here he is he's give me a shout when you want to get up [Music] tells me that you're a citizen now that you've got citizens right yeah i killed a man so they made me a citizen i'm gonna kill a man too you what geller i don't wanna be his slave i couldn't stand that you can refuse oh come on anything i said he'd take me anyway you know that unless i can stop him might give me your cut no that you can get yourself [Music] shot well if you won't let me help myself then then will you kill geller for you my my face i need some help it's not that easy look we're in a place we don't know where we don't know why we don't know anything except i just had to kill a man for the first time in my life stop him from killing me well if that man that that pig gallery if he touches me it'll be like he was killing me i mean that micah i couldn't stand will you help me mike [Applause] okay i'll do something you promise yeah i promise there you go [Music] cnn [Music] [Music] how come you're so nice to a stranger probably because you are a stranger if i knew you better i probably wouldn't be so nice is that why you threw me the gun listen i am a big fish in a small pond [Music] it's as simple do you ever get sudden urges you're propositioning me are you no i'm not i'm just offering you not only the hospitality perhaps but the best [Music] come on [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] well there goes friendliner oh we didn't see you we're all friends but he likes to think sometimes that we're more than old friends if you get my meaning he's jealous i could say that well what would he feel about you and me being up here together he'd probably kill you [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] look [Music] you are taking this much too personally you realize really it's a kind of pornography [Music] you are jeopardize hello you are jeopardizing the entire project [Music] [Music] um [Music] hey [Music] getting the law to give a new out of the weapon i was just interested yeah well i'll tell you one of these days i just might say [Music] come on we ain't got all day you mind if we take our 25 now just in case they mean just in case in case you're real serious about that little gap more team one old geller's got staked out for himself you better listen to the old man tell me friendliner you can call me miss defend that [Music] tummy you take 25 from every business in town that's right well you're into a good thing well any man qualified for the job is welcome to try for but nobody wants a job there right hell every man jackie wants the job everybody wants to be king or [ __ ] hill but ain't that easy you know that's funny i thought it would be easy i mean after all you've got no bodyguards [Music] don't need it let me ask you oh just for the sake of discussion what would i have to do to qualify well there's nothing to it all you have to do is become immortal now when we say immortal we mean a man who's free of the fear of being killed by another man well uh who do i have to kill to be so lucky get the right automatically after 20 legitimate kills that's 20 fair fights that's all it takes and no man can shoot you that is the law let me ask you another question how do i get the right to choose a woman oh you got it already you're a citizen you mean i can go to a choosing and claim any woman i want you could if there was one to claim martine taken not until the choosing she's now you listen to me hey you go up against old gallery the day that you die and that is a fact you better think about that come on [Music] oh yeah [Music] sent me i want to see over the jail right away oh wait wait wait wait are you okay fine it's so funny to do still okay compared to ricardo i'm alive prepare to martin i'm free [Music] come on you wait up here [Music] i wanted to ask you do you remember how we got here we walked that's how my feet won't let me forget it before that before we started walking [Music] i can remember what all i can remember is that there was something [Music] i can remember [Music] me [Music] [Music] we don't get some reinforcements we're gonna blow the whole project negative repeat negative and do something we're allocating the computer backup facilities priority rating three two one switch on [Music] i don't know i thought i remember oh maybe you might remember i don't know what you're talking about [Music] it's ridiculous we could have lost him right there i thought that it was impossible to break through impossible to remember i never saw it happen before your subject must have a hell of a resistance to suitable realities how about that other subject that guy peter is he all right peter he's fine no danger of him remembering all he cares about is that lewis has boots and he doesn't friend landers in there [Music] hey where you going [Music] why do you play by their rules you played by their rules you got lucky this time maybe next time i'll get lucky [Music] [Music] see you brought your muscle along here yeah sit down you old fart catch your breath maybe getting old i can still run your ass off and i ain't sitting down yeah oh girlfriend's been asking for you you must say you're going to ride into the last moment on the big white horse and savor from that lucky old hog gilly is that what you plan to do don't you think it's funny because it is everyone horse around his mind no matter how bad smelling an ugly old gallery is he's got a right to the woman that's the law around here and that's what you gotta understand yeah i understand you uh want no trouble you understand perfectly [Music] you know where to find her [Music] play [Music] well i uh didn't want to wake you up i didn't sleep the mood was too bright i feed you in here you hungry i could ask i am not hungry i am scared i am scared to death hey i told you something all right you told me but i want to know what you're doing about it wait a minute you're just listening to me all right all right i'm listening brother tell me what have you got to tell me that you don't have anything to tell me do you kill him you've got to kill that love all right all right if you

hey you put a good shine on them boots now boy you're here no reason to get all fancied up you want the girl you choose her she's yours don't see any reason to take a bath how well you want a girl to appreciate she's best not to think too bad again girl don't appreciate you come alongside her head once or twice to see how darn fat she appreciates boy all you know about women you can stick up your nose and you still have plenty of room to bring well i know this much about women you can't treat them too bad but you can treat them too good i hope your hands are clean you put a mark on that hand i'll put a mark on your hide chores the handsome hat that had cost me a hundred dollars what are you gawking at come on [Music] hello i thought i'd just drop in to see if there's any truth in the rumor well there's always some truth to every rumor which particular rumor did you have in mind folks are saying that you are going to challenge gela at the choosing today well yeah i've gone crazy don't you realize there isn't a chance geller's gang outguns you by 15 men how many men have you got well not enough to make any difference then why because i promised a friend that i'd help her out what's the sense in getting yourself killed for a friend i don't intend to get myself killed if i can help her you're beginning to disappoint me really i'm sorry i'd rather disappoint you than be ashamed of myself and if i let a friend down i'd be ashamed [Music] [Music] there's a couple of hours before the choosing time to change your mind my mind i want to change it's geller's gala isn't a man who's going to change his mind well then i'm just gonna have to change him for him [Music] i'm going back to the casino take care of business [Music] bye hang on whatever word is you oh yeah about that martine girl the girl you're fixing to claim oh yeah what about it yeah well i'm afraid there's gonna be a little problem there's another fellow intense disclaimer for yourself now the man's name is mike lewis that bastard who killed dog flint yeah [Music] you tell him about me i told him you told me he didn't give a [ __ ] you tell him i already got 19 notches in my gun yeah you tell him i'm one killing away from immortality yeah you tell him i intend to have that little lady you got locked up in the jailhouse you tell him proper [Music] you belong directly why don't you tell him [Music] it's almost as if you wanted to terminate him i don't want anything except to find out who survives i am not interested in any heroics even if you are i'm interested in finding exceptional men aren't you depends on what you mean by exceptional for our project a man who can lead and kill yet think and act for himself whilst working for the state that's my exceptional man and finding such a man is what this project is all about isn't it exactly and the elimination of those who don't measure up nile it's nothing personal as far as i'm concerned you're feeding the input you're structuring the stimuli it is personal you're setting him up no he's walking right into it [Music] you son of a [ __ ] you're gonna get him killed aren't you you don't need no help from me let me go to the right half of the choosing bus right [Music] we talk about your friend louis yeah [Music] no such thing as later [Music] what's up [Music] i understand you're [Music] that's because i feel like [Music] we're done talking let's get to kill him wait a minute i think there's no need [Music] around here yeah i know how you do things around here yeah life's cheap in blood city i don't want to have to fight everybody but now you should have thought about that before you came up against me you want to play the heroes fine and dandy now let's see you die hero i'm going to count to three and we'll both draw at the same time i don't want nobody saying this one a fair price one hold it now why don't you just tell your friends to stay out of it and then it'll be terrifying oh hell i don't want to be as fair as all that too hold it [Music] everybody smile stand real still unless you want to see what a scatter gun will do to a mess of meat you two old farts are going to get yourself killed slow killed if you fool without only a full fool with a fool you scratch your nose now blow your head off now just wait a minute wait a minute we don't have to have any shooting what do you got in mind let's let's talk you always wanted to talk what's the matter you're scared you're goddamn right i'm scared aren't you scared of one scared of having our assets shot off that's what what is it with you people i just want to survive don't you want to have a good life geez i don't understand all you people you don't want to get killed well late in the game but he's finally catching on i'll kill you what are you doing you're reprogramming the situation no i'm merely restructuring it i've spoken to the supervisor he's given us permission to alter the game plan i told him how impressed you were with this louis guy and the supervisor thought it might be a good idea to let me change lewis's coordinates just to see if he could handle it see if you could kill him kill you mean terminate don't you anyway you're quite wrong i'm only trying to reach a qualified conclusion but you're changing the rules perhaps that's life isn't it [Music] please just leave her alone [Music] [Applause] nobody goes up against me boy and lives nobody now you just turn yourself around we're going outside if i splatted your brains and your guts all over a nice wall you can understand that and get out [Music] son of a [ __ ] you're starting without me maybe mr friendlander wants that girl for himself you know well he can pick her again now you come with me and watch me choose your girl then we let her watch me kill you all fair and square under the law and then if you keep your gun on hand but if this boils even cute you blast them [Music] this one is sold for 150 to 67.43 now give your money to video you get one call up for your new slave and now citizens we come to the highlight of this year she already chosen well now maybe she ain't maybe uh citizen louisiana got something to say about that citizen lewis ain't got [ __ ] to say about anything the cities i'm sorry then you uh you never really did have a chance to shoot god damn it man look i've got me some shooting some scoring to do before the moon comes up get that girl out here let's get on with it [Music] get the girl you should be right along yeah and hurry it up [Music] got yourself all prettied up the old goat [Music] where'd your deputy go to anyway foreign [Music] you're in such a hell of a hurry why don't you just kill mr lewis and get it over that way you won't have to waste any time getting at the girl why don't you just mind your own business and leave me to ten minds [Music] [Music] how the hell did she get away from you tell me that friend lander was right there in your jail how did you get out i don't know yet you know don't call me a liar please you had your eye on that girl ever since you come in here now that your ex-lady friend is done with you thinking i'm getting yourself a new one what was that about my ex-lady friend oh mr everybody in town knows that you've been having it off we miss catherine that cost me a hundred dollars [Music] [Music] [Music] of blood city i am immortal you cannot kill me i get this [ __ ] we'll see how immortal you'll be when i pull this triggy [Music] yeah you're going to tell me where you hit that girl i might defender you know and you'll tell me first i'll take the gun now you're making a bad mistake friend you listen friend i only need one more kill i don't give a damn whether it's him or you now you ease that gun out nice and slow a very big a very bad mistake [Music] than he would have been immortal of course there's something you can't afford to lose are you gonna shoot that fella no reason to not the boss is dead no hard feelings all right get him out of here come on very clear where's my team come on i already said i don't know oh don't you [Music] i just killed a man call me a liar god damn it where are you telling you the truth all right it doesn't know where she is [Music] if you want to know where she is you're gonna have to ask me because i'm the one who took her away i was taking her to the old mine she wanted to hide out until after the choosing we've gotten about as far as here when uh all these men just came from nowhere yeah looks like six seven men the only one writer got away i ought to put you in jail i'm not interested in what you ought to do i'm interested in what you're going to do what is it you would like me to do i'd like you to get back to town and get some men you're fixing on riding up ahead taking a look at the outlaws camp that's right and what makes you think you can find it if i do get lost the uh lady here will lead me to it well i will anyway i don't know the way and even if i did i wouldn't tell you ah damn you come on i'll meet you the old man soon outrageous she has deliberately manipulated events in order to protect the subject michael lewis she has interfered with every possible interfered but that is our job we are trying to find women and men emotionally and physically equipped for leadership i would like you to look at his primary pattern i believe that we have a suitable candidate for kill master in michael lewis yes very promising but we need more than promises we have to get new squad leaders we're losing killmasters faster than we can replace them we are falling behind and of course we all know what happens to people who [Music] fall behind [Music] they urgently need a replacement of the eastern zone why not use friendlando he's already been equipped and trained we intend to use him but not quite yet we have something rather special in mind for our man friendlander now about this uh lewis person if your fellow lewis manages to qualify i want him is that clear no more diversions qualify him or terminate him you know exactly where their hideout is don't you they didn't ambush you in my team you took her right to them didn't you why do your favor that's why she's gonna get in your way every time you turn around you mean she'll get in your way come on believe a horse is here [Music] which is as far as i go [Music] there must be at least 20 men in that camp you're going to take them all by yourself i'm not after 20 men just one girl you think friendland is going to get help he hasn't i know him why are you doing this you're throwing everything away oh [Music] okay start ready to roll [Music] [Music] at your level to find them how many do you think there are not many else they would have rushed us when they had the chance [Music] maybe two three men maybe only one only one have to be crazy to attack us don't think he is attacking us i think he's just trying to keep his pin down [Music] well that can work two ways [Music] so [Music] ah [Music] he's out of ammo we can take him now [Music] [Applause] [Music] ah [Music] ah [Music] dog [Music] now damn you if it wasn't for me you'd be dead now i knew friend lana wouldn't cross the street to help you [Music] um [Music] well seems to pick the winner after all he's managed magnificently i must admit he's managed magnificently i'm afraid mr lewis has not come up to my expectations after all but i don't understand he's achieved everything whatever he's achieved he's about to lose mr lewis is about to be terminated don't you see no i don't see see what oh [Music] oh well i guess i have a
