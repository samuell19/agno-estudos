[♪] Hello, boys. TOGETHER: Jerry. I had no idea you were the men sent out to paper this room. I'm glad to see you. Tell me, Jerry, what are you doing here? Well, this is my house. You must have opened a bank. Yeah, at night. No, I sell insurance. Say, if you fellows want to quit working and collect 500 a month, all you've got to do is take out a policy. How do you get in on this insurance gag? Well, you take out a policy, then you go to the insurance doctor and pretend you're nuts. And the insurance company pays you 500 a month. Five hundred dollars a month. It's a banana. Bonanza. Bonanza, banana, bandanna-- As long as we don't have to work anymore. How much does it cost? Oh, $25 down, 50 a month. I've got an application blank. I'll get it and help you fill it out. Fifty dollars. Fork over. Where's that dollar? Oh, don't. Don't. No. Come on. Get your hands off. That's my favorite dollar. What do you mean? I raised it from a cent. Now, cut it out. Don't. Come on. Start-- [WHINES] [WHINES] [HUMMING] Hey, where's the key? In the purse. In the purse? What's it in there for? Any sap knows that. So I won't lose it. You won't-- Come on. Come on. Come on. You pickpocket. That's what you are-- A pickpocket. That's what you are. [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] Wait a minute. Hold still, will you? [WHIMPERS] Gettin' it the hard way, huh? [LAUGHS] [SNAP] [GRUNTING] Hm. Can't even trust a moth. Give me that. You're next. Shoot the money to me, honey. I don't want to play. Get away. Come on. [GRUNTS] Oh. Oh. Come across with that dough, or I'll tear the rest of it out. Oh, all right. All right, now we'll fill out the blank. Oh, uh, which one do you want to insure? TOGETHER: Him. Well, not me. I refuse. I still refuse. Ow, ow, ow. I surrender, dear. I surrender. All right. Here you are. Sign right on the dotted line. [WHIMPERS] This is the joint. Boy, we'll be in the money soon. Come on, Fido, come on. How do you do? How do you do? [BARKS] What's the matter with him? Bats in the belfry. The insurance company wants the doctor to examine him to prove that he's batty. That shouldn't be hard. Where's your policy? Right here, madam. [HOWLS, BARKS] Mm. Nyuck, nyuck. [BARKS] [WHIMPERS] [BARKING] [PANTING] How about a date, toots? Woo woo. [SCOFFS] Go away. Go away. Oh, hit a dumb animal, would you? [BARKS] [PANTING] Oh. [GIGGLES] [HUMMING] Ah-ah. You're supposed to be a dog, and don't forget it. [YELLS] Get down there. Come on. Here they are, doctor. Hi, doctor. Which one is the crazy one? That one. [BARKS] Hey. Quiet, Bowser. Yowser. This is a very sad case, doctor. Ever since he's been bitten by a dog, he thinks he is one. What happened to the dog that bit him? MOE: He died. Step into the office. I'll examine him. Come on, Hydrophobia. [WHIMPERS, BARKS] Up here. Now, let me see, the heart. Two spades. I double. I redouble. [YELPS] Let the doctor do his stuff. Go on, doc. [SCREAMS] Oh, doc, you'll have to excuse him. He's a very playful pup. [RATTLES] There's something loose inside. Oh, you're wrong, doctor. His head is empty. [LIQUID SLOSHES] Sounds like water on the brain. You mean he may go from mad to worse? LERIOUS: Exactly. I ought to operate on his brain. You can't do that. You'd have to cut through the bone. [KNOCK] Come in. [PUFFS] Oh, ow. Oh. This is serious. He may go violently insane any minute. Oh, he's worse than that right now. [BARKS] Now, be quiet, Fido. Take it easy. Be-- Be quiet. Didn't I tell you he was crazy? Do we get the insurance money? Why, this man is dangerous. I've got to operate immediately. What? On me? Yes. Now, don't worry. It-- It won't hurt. I'm just going to take the top of your head off. [MOANS] Come on, Moe. Not me. Come on. Wait a minute! Call the police. Hey, hey! Wait a minute, Fido! Hey, what's the idea? Get up here. What's going on here? Quick, officer. A madman just left my office. [GRUNTS] You nitwit. If you had played your part like a Pekingese instead of a wolfhound, our plan would have worked. There he is. Hey, you! [ALL GROAN] Come on. [SCREECHING] Quick. The truck. I told them, "I don't care who you are, it'll cost you $2 to get the pooch," and he paid. Telephone headquarters and have them broadcast an alarm. That's a good idea, doc. Hurry up. He's dangerous. Boy, that was a narrow escape. You're tellin' me. That guy wanted to carve me up. [BARKS] [BARKS] [BARKS] [GROWLS] [CHATTERING] [DOG GROWLS, BARKS] I never heard two dogs make so much noise.
