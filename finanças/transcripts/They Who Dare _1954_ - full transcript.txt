[intro music playing] [serious music playing] [narrator] September 1942. This is the eighth army waiting in the desert at El Alamein, poised for the attack which was to drive Rommel out of North Africa. The greatest menace to the success of our forces came from the Luftwaffe based on the African mainland and the Greek Islands. The RAF attacks on these scattered bases with every plane that could be spared were not enough. Something new was tried: night raids by small patrols of special troops, commandos, to strike at these island bases to harass and tie down the enemy's garrisons and destroy his bombers on the ground. This is the story of one of the first of these raids. [crows cawing] - [flute playing] - [goats bleating] [trumpet music playing] - [goats bleating] - [plays flute] [upbeat dance music playing] Been stood up? Looks like it. Who... dares... wins. "Who dares wins"? That's our motto. Well... Well... [night club music playing] I was about to give you up. Yes, I see. Excuse me. This'll only take a minute. What will you drink? - Champagne... - [chuckles] A silly question deserves a silly answer. Champagne. What are you doing here in Cairo? I'm afraid I've come to spoil your leave. Uh-oh. I was afraid of that. Well, what is it this time? HQ have got a job for us at last. This is it, Tom. Is it? They want... They want us to make a small scale raid. If we pull this one off, there'll be a lot more to follow. We're in business. Nice, steady work... What do they mean by "small scale raid"? Ten or twelve of us. And how many are there? Thirty thousand... This is it, all right. Good odds even if we do lose. What's the point? Since when did the Army ever... [exhales] [music continues] Since when did the Army ever tell you the point of anything? You've got the job. What more do you want? Just a little more. [chuckles] Such as what? I want to know how we get to wherever we are going to, and once we are there, I want to know how we get back. Tom, you worry too much. The Navy's dealing with this. What are you doing there? You know, if I'm a pirate, so are you. With this difference: I was detailed to volunteer for brigandage. But you, you chose it, and you love it. Well, go on with the story. We have to report to Lieutenant Stevens at the submarine base tomorrow. But um... that's tomorrow. Excuse me... I don't dance. Do you? No. - Will you? - Mm-hmm. Who dares... wins... Carry on the good work. This will take a little longer than a minute. [slow orchestra music playing] [boat horn blares] What’s that? That's what you’re going on. She's Greek. She looks it. She's a rough looking old number, isn't she? Yes, she's a bit grubby, but she's got a list of kills as long as her hull. Her skipper's got a price on his head. What's his name? Oh. Poppo... Nickers... Nickie... Oh, come and meet him. - Hello, Stevens. - Hello, sir. Yes. [footsteps] May I introduce Captain Nicholaides Papadapoulus. That's his name. Lieutenant Graham, Lieutenant Poole. How are you? - How do you do, sir? - [clears throat] - How are you? - How do you do? - Stevens told me a lot about you. - He's told me lots about you too, sir. And you still want me to take you on this trip? - There and back. - Back... [laughs] And people think I am crazy. Well, there is not a lot of room in my boat but anyway... I won’t be so crowded coming home. Maybe not. But perhaps you've not cornered all the luck in the Mediterranean. See what I mean? Yes, sure, they're crazy. Perhaps you haven't cornered all that either, sir. [laughs] I like that. That's very good. I love all crazy people. - How many are you? - Six... two Greek guides. And we are looking for two Greek officers to take with us. [hesitates] Uh... Um... Oh, Captain George Kounas! Just the man. Where do we find him? Oh anywhere here at the base. Everybody knows him. Better start looking for him now. No. Plenty of time. You come and have drink with me. You will like ouzo. That's Greek for "wood alcohol". [both laugh] What are these flowers? Do you know? I don't know. I've never seen them before. I'm not very good at flowers. [man] They’re Kamparas. Kamparas? [man] They grow in the Greek mountains. [birds chirping] I only wanted to smell it. They're mostly buds. They have no scent. And when they’re in bloom? When they’re in bloom, they have a scent which fills the air of all Greece, and you carry it in your nostrils to the end of your life. Yes, we’re looking for Captain Kounas. Do you know where we'll find him? I'm Captain Kounas. Captain Papadapoulus suggested we come to see you. Come in. - [slow music playing] - I must talk to you. I thought so. George... Oh, I am sorry, darling. This is Captain George Kounas. Mademoiselle de Marais. How do you do? This is the man who drove me out of Greece. To escape his bullying, I went to France to live. Then, after ten years, the Germans had to drive me back, so he could reach me again. I'll get you a drink. Well, what do you think of our boy now? About the same... a man of qualities, mostly bad. A tough soldier... when you can get him to fight... I want to a little talk with my old friend, if you please. Who's that man? I'll tell you later. Keep the drinks going. - [slow orchestra music playing] - [people laughing] If it's a British raid, why do they want Greek officers? It's a try-out raid. If it comes out, there'll be many others that we, the Greek officers, can lead. - I don't believe in gestures. - [people laughing] What do you believe in? - This? - No. I don't believe in leaving a post where I have everything I want. I don't believe in staking my life on impossible odds. I don't believe in anything but the religion of our days. Nothing is more noble than to stay alive. Smell these. Let them argue with your conscience. [man whistles] Aren't you glad Captain Kounas managed to waggle you out of that office job? You must have been awfully bored being chairborne all that time. Yes. - What is your name? - George. Same as mine. Then I'll have to call you George 1 and George 2 to avoid confusion. [whistles] Pleased to meet you, George 1. How do you do, George 2? Very many years ago, a wise men say ♪ ♪ Very many things That still hold good today ♪ Why doesn’t the boy tell us where we're going? Confucius say prizefighter never show ♪ ♪ Where he propose To land the knockout blow ♪ You’d make up a ruddy song about it if you saw me with me head blown off. Hey, there's an idea in that too! ♪ Confucius say Each man must keep his head ♪ ♪ Or enjoy your flipping coin When you are dead ♪ Here, look. Look who's following us. - Here, Brains. You always know everything. - [whistles] What’s Mr. Poole carting those two foreigners around for? Isn't it obvious? They’re guides. He must be going where they came from. Boyd, you'd soon find out where that is if they were in here. Well, my guess is we're going to liberate the free English... in Cardiff. [all laugh] Easy to see why we borrowed you from the Marines, Boyd. Got a nice sense of humor, haven't you? Ah, we're going to need it, Basher and me, slumming with the Army. [both laugh] Tom, get the gear stowed on board as soon as you can. Then get them below to the briefing. Keep the guides here. I don't want them gossiping with the men. I am going aboard to get Stevens. Come on, George 1, George 2. - Sergeant Corcoran. - Sir. - Sergeant Evans. - Sir. Get the foldboat and the two dinghies stowed through the forward torpedo loading hatch. Look after the bombs yourselves. I’m going aboard. [all] Sir. [boat horn blares] - Do you speak English? - Yes. Oh yes. All right. - Where do you come from? - Me? From home. Do you speak English? - Sure. - [Barrett] Where do you come from? My name is Patroklis. I'm Greek. I leave home in 1936. I don’t want to be a peasant. I want to go to America where everybody's rich. - Ah, but where’s home? - I go to Athens one year, scrub floors, wash, dishes, save money. Same thing in Rome, lot of work, save money... - Never mind about... - Then Monte Carlo, then Paris. I am halfway to America now, eh? Then the war and the Germans come... But half a minute. What we want to know... So I run from the German and bump right into the British. And the British take me where? They take me right back where I came from... home. - [Barrett gargling] - Ay... but where's home? - [engine rumbling] - [Poole yells] Boyd! Barrett! Get back to your work! Patroklis, you come aboard! Well, Gabby, d'you find out where they came from? Aye, "from home." - Where's that? - We never found out. Stupid foreigners can't answer a straight question. Hey, these are pretty heavy. We’re carrying five bombs in each haversack. You'll get used to it. Never seen bombs like this before, Sarge. No... Brains and I made them. So soft. That's so they can lie on a smooth or sloping surface... if necessary. - You mean you and Brains made all these? - That's right. - Loving hands at home. - Mm. What makes them go off? These. Brains is carrying them separately. I wish you’d stop all this Brains business. Anyone would think I was in the education corps. Sometimes I think that's where you ought to be... with a nice, little commission. I wouldn't want a nice, little commission in anything, thank you. Too much responsibility. Ah, but you do have a few creature comforts, don’t you? Maybe, but I just don't see myself in the part. Selling gloves in a Cardiff Draper's? I didn't see myself as a sergeant in the Commandoes, but you never can tell, can you? We're all here? Right. I'll put you all in the picture... set your curiosity at rest. Quite simply, the idea is for the ten of us should make a landing on one of the Dodecanese Islands. I'll tell you which one in a minute. There are two airfields on the island. Our job is to blow them both up. [drops map] Simultaneously! This is the island... Rhodes. The Greeks call it Rothos, which means the island of roses. At first glance, this would seem an impossible job, but... with any luck, to coin a phrase, we... we could have roses all the way. Good luck. [dramatic music playing] That was a waste of good wine. [dramatic music playing] [Graham] We land at this inlet at night. They may be waiting for us, but if we get away with it, we can make our way into the mountains. That’ll be our only chance of approaching the two airfields unobserved. We can only travel at night because the whole island is crawling with troops. [dramatic music playing] The first night, we will travel to this stream which is important because it's the last water we'll see. [Graham] The mountains after that will be bone-dry. [serene music playing] The second night, we split into two parties. Mr. Poole will take his party to Maritza. - [airplanes soaring] - [dramatic music playing] The rest will come with me to... Calator. [dramatic music playing] On the third night, we attack both airfields at exactly the same time. On the fourth night, we return to the starting point at the inlet, here. Captain Papadapoulus will pick us up. Those who fail to make the rendezvous will find their own way home. [laughter] All right? Let's have a look. Are we ever going to get there? We have made good time to get this far in four days. How far is that? That only Papa Papadapoulus can tell you. He's made it his pet secret. [unhooks periscope] Could you pass the oil please? - Give me the cheese please. - Cheers. Yup. - Well? - Pass the olives, please. What did he say? We've made good time to get this far in four days. They’ve been telling us that ever since we got on board this ruddy sardine tin. Captain Papadapoulus, once and for all, will you... Oh, don't waste your breath. Captain Papadapoulus and they say we shall get there soon enough. That's right. [chuckles] Much better to eat... than talk. Oh, here we go again. - [mid-tempo music playing] - [laughing] Did you have to make a present of your own gallery? He wanted it... And he has a way of getting what he wants. Yeah, I know... flattery. [smirks] He thinks they're funny. [laughing heartily] [light-hearted music playing] [whistling] [Papadapoulus laughs] [laughing] That's me. Oh, those people... all crazy. [submarine whining] Been hours since the last dive. Are we nearly there? Well, maybe in half an hour. I can get rid of all you crazy people and get on with the war. What are you doing after? Swim up the Danube and capture Hitler? Not a bad idea at that. If we do, we'll take you with us. [Papadapoulus laughs] [Papadapoulus] E-boat. [locks periscope] We lose him and then surface. - Port 30. Group up. Full ahead together. - Port 30. Group up. Full ahead together. They've spotted an E-boat. As soon as they lose them, we surface. - I'll go and tell the boys. - Yes, I'll go too. We sighted an E-boat. As soon as we lose her, we're gonna surface. You'd better get ready. [submarine whining] [Papadapoulus] All right, Number 1. Diving stations. [lieutenant] Diving stations. Diving stations. Stand by to surface. Stand by to surface, sir. Report main vents. Open all LP master blows. [lieutenant] Permission to open lower lid, sir? Yes, please. Do you hear anything? [conductor] No, nothing, sir. Ready to surface, sir. [Steven] You'd better pull these stockings over your boots. It's going to be wet and slippery out on the casing. Surface! [periscope slides] - [first lieutenant] Blow one main ballast. - [air rushing] Blow fours. Blow sixes. Thirty two feet, sir. Twenty-five. Twenty. Fifteen feet, sir. Stop the blower. - [wind blowing] - [water splashing] [dragging tarp] [submarine whining] Come on. - Ready, Basher? - Yes, you come with me. Patroklis, you come with me. [waves splashing] [footsteps] Well, we're off. Thanks for the ride. We'll see you on Saturday at 2300 hours, on the dock. I will give you a big party... ouzo, shish kebab, olive oil, the works, eh, Stevens? Steak and kidney pie, or you can keep your party. - I'll cook it myself. - Crumbs... Steak and kidney pie for ten. Don’t be late. All right. [wind blowing] [submarine blows] [somber music playing] Good luck. You will need it... Crazy people... [smirks] [dramatic music playing] And don’t hide everything in the same place. Plenty of hiding places in the rocks below there. Scatter it round a bit. [Poole] Did you hear what I said, Boyd? Yes, sir! You don't need two bottles. - But it's water, sir. - It's also weight. Corcoran, they have one bottle per pack per man. - We'll be at the spring by dawn. - We hope. [dramatic music playing] [somber music playing] [explosion] Minefield. We'll have to make a detour. [pensive music playing] [dramatic music playing] [wind blowing] [Patroklis] It has never been dry before. Take the bottle out of my pack. Now, collect the others. Sir, the village is not far from here. The sun'll be up soon. We're not traveling in daylight. All right. Thirsty work in the Marines, isn't it, Boyd? - I’m sorry, I... - That's all right. It doesn't always pay to hoard, you know, Evans. - We all regret the drink we never had, eh? - Huh? Oh. Well... that's the lot. Mm-hmm. We’ll have to ration this out to last the day. Soon as it’s dark, Patroklis will take us up to his village. We can get some water there. Correct? Yes, sir. There is a good well there. Catch. - Barrett and Boyd. - Sir? Lookouts there and there. Rest of you, take cover. I’ll give you a hand. The best laid schemes of mice and men, sir. My dear Corcoran, the situation is obvious enough. It doesn’t need comments from you... or Robert Burns. This is going to slow us up maybe. I don't like it. [Poole] Your compatriot's a fine guide! Yes. Oh yes! [Poole] I wouldn’t trust that gentleman to find a beer barrel in a bed. I hope you're a better guide. [Toplis] All right. Yes, sir. [laughs] If he ever heard a joke, sir, laugh himself to death, he would. This'll do us. - [cars pass] - [crickets chirping] [crickets chirping] [whistling a song] I haven’t heard that for years. It's so pretty. [Patroklis] Shepherd's Pipes. I used to play them once... - when I was a boy. - [George Two] I am home. My home is so near... only a few minutes away. I thought your home was in America. My mother and my sister are down there. My sister is grown up now. Maybe I could see her? After all these years? [snorts] What for? I know I say many foolish things. When I am far away, I don't care, but so near, like this... Maybe I could get some water? No. You stay here. [flute music playing] You know, George, I don't think the Englishman likes our country. I heard one of them say "See Rhodes and die". [laughs] I'll stop him. [dramatic music playing] [George 1 winces] - But you're hurt. - No. No, no, it's nothing. Nothing? You're cut and bleeding. - Oh, come on. - No! You stay here. Give me a handkerchief. It's nothing, I tell you. It's just an old wound. It's done this before. Don't be a fool, George. Now, listen, I don't want the others told. But Graham must know that you are... You keep quiet about this! Do you hear? Yes, George. [serious music playing] [child screaming] [water rushing] [running] [dramatic music playing] [children outside talking] [gasps] [soldiers marching] [soldier shouts in Italian] What's the matter? Patroklis... he's run off to his village. - Deserted? - No, he would never do that. Of course not. It’s his home. I suppose he just... had to go there. Lookouts in, packs on, ready to move when I say. Now... If we move in daylight, they might see us. Right. If he runs into trouble and talks, we’re done. I don’t think he'll talk. Better get ready to move. [gulping water] [children chattering] [children yelling] [children screaming] [yelling continues] [yelling continues] [yelling continues] He might not talk, but if they catch him, they'll make him talk. It's dangerous to stay, but it's lethal to move. We'll have to choose between the bad and the worse. Right, we'll stay. But all of you, be ready for a quick getaway. Sergeant Evans, Sergeant Corcoran, lookouts. [children chattering] [chattering continues] [chattering continues] [chattering continues] [commander yelling commands] [commander yelling commands] [soldiers marching] [children chattering] [dramatic music playing] [dog barking] - Marika. Marika. - [replies in Greek] [sentimental music playing] Looks like the boy is getting worried. Plowing up and down like me waiting for the pubs to open. Comes with relying on perishing foreigners. They are all the same, either in a panic or talking about l'amour. He's been a long time. Tell me, Mr. Toplis, what do you think Patroklis will do? Yes. Oh yes. Now listen. Supposing this was your village, you wouldn't have run away, would you? When my village come, yes. That's good to know. I wish it had not been one of us who did this. No one will blame the rest of us Greeks for what one did. I suppose not, but you always feel responsible for your own people in front of others. Come on. Take 'em. Can you see anything? Afraid not, no. Lord. It's a bit of a spot. You're worried about it, aren't you? Course I'm worried about it. Wouldn't you be? I picked him. Yes, you did, didn't you? Well, I picked you too, remember? [chuckles] Do you think he will come back? I really wouldn’t know, sir. Volunteering no opinions, eh, Corcoran? I'm in the Army. [whistles signal] Get down! Come on! You blithering idiot! What do you think you're doing? I saw my mother and sister. They say you must go away. If we're caught near here, they take hostages, burn houses, shoot people. They're Greeks like you and me. They must take chances too. I am sorry. All right. But they saw you. Can you trust them? Will they talk? They will not talk, never. All right. Ease packs. Hold it! - Don't. Let me speak with them. - They're children. They'll talk. Boyd and Barrett, encircle them. Go slowly. Don't frighten them. All right. Leave it, leave it! That settles it. Now we'll have to move. Better pushing the picture. Come on. There’s another village here, not far out of our way. How long would it take to get there? By the road, a couple of hours. But through the mountains, all day. So at the worst, we shall have water by tonight. How much have we got left? [Corcoran] Only three bottles. Suppose we can't get any at this village? What happens? Then the whole operation's a wash-out. My party's got to go across these mountains tomorrow, and they're bone-dry. If there's any water in that village, we'll get it. All right, let's go. [pensive music playing] [crows cawing] [sighs] You all right? [hyperventilating] I think you’re forcing the pace. Yes, I know. How much water we got left? About a swallow each. You'd better let them have it. [dramatic music playing] [baby goat bleating] [baby goat bleats] [dog barking] [dog barking] Come on! Come on! [Poole] Troops. [Poole] One thing about a military map... always tells you where a place is but never who's in it. - [Poole] Or why. - It's obvious. Well? An ammunition dump... or as close to the airfield as this, a petrol dump... Well, whatever it is, it’s too full of Italians for my liking. There's an olive grove. It's the only cover into the village. We can creep through! The olive grove is probably the exact location of the petrol dump. If it is the only cover we've got, we've got to use it. Give me the bottles. Bottles. Tom, you're in good cover. We’ll be as quick as we can. I hope he knows something about water. Don't worry. He won all his badges as a boy scout. Put me in a tight spot, and I'll take the boy every time. Why not? It's his business. [dramatic music playing] [dramatic music intensifies] Keep still, keep still. Don't move. The whole place is mined, and for heaven's sake, don't panic. You crazy idiot! I’ll show you I don't panic. For my life, I don't care, or I wouldn't be here. I'll get the water. Yes, and blow yourself up, which wouldn't worry me in the very least. But what happens to the rest of us? Do you want us caught before the job's done? I don't panic! All right. All right. Keep quiet. Now, look, we're going back. Give me a fifteen feet start... and go exactly where I go... - and keep your distance. - And the water? We can't get the water here. It's no use... whole place is mined. That's the second time you've made a muck of it. - [Patroklis yells] - [Poole] Barrett. Yes, sir! If you're as good as he is in a tight spot, you'll be doing all right. He wanted to go through the minefield alone. Would you like to try it? No, sir. All right then. Anyway, this whole thing is my fault. I should have swapped some of the bombs for supplies in the first place. All we can do now is to go back to the beach. The whole thing is a washout. I'm sorry. We'll have to get there before morning. - There's a party coming up, sir. - What sort of a party? I can’t see. Ambush positions. Tom, take you all on up there. We'll cover this side. Let them pass, but if they see us, scrag 'em. But remember, no shooting. You'd better lose that too. He's all right, David. Come on, chaps. [donkey steps] [soft music playing] [in Greek] Come. - [in Greek] We have brought food for you. - [in Greek] Thank you, thank you. Marika. [dramatic music playing] [in Greek] Father Konstandis, you're endangering your life. What is all this? I don't know. We'll find out. This is my sister, Marika, sir. - Hello, beautiful. - [all clamoring and murmuring] Come on. Break it up, break it up. Sorry, sir. And this is Father Konstandis. - Hello. - Hello. He brings you this food with his blessing. How did they know we were here? They all know, sir. With these shepherd boys, the news travels everywhere in the mountains. That's a happy thought. Can you trust them? [in Greek] Can the shepherd boys be trusted? [in Greek] You need never be afraid, sir, and can always have complete faith in these boys. My people will be with you wherever you are. All right, get the food. It's on the donkey. Thank them, bless them and get rid of them. Corcoran! There's a cave here. Bring the food up, and we'll eat in cover. You want him, eh? - Well, you look after him properly. - [in Greek] ♪ Confucius say Each man must keep his head ♪ Well, you keep your head. Don’t wolf the lot at once. Why not? The boy ordered us back to the beach, didn't he? So he did. And we have enough food there to last us until the sub picks us up, haven't we? So we have. Well then. Why starve ourselves? Cause I've changed the order. We are proceeding according to plan. What? On this mouthful, sir? Confucius say, "Never look gift horse in mouth." I wouldn't look in the mouth save he had a bit more meat on him. Well, it's probably all these people had anyway. They're half-starved themselves. How many instruments do you play in this band? Huh? What do you mean? Well, a minute ago, you didn't like these people. Well, that was a minute ago. [all laugh] You can't beat the British. Their mouths full of water, their hands full of bread and they forget all their troubles. Interesting observation. How's your stiff upper lip? Stiff? Mine's hanging out like a Ubangi's. What's the matter? Look, I've been thinking. You'll have to watch that, won't you? No way. - I've got a feeling about all this. - Hmm? Yes. I've... got a feeling it... won’t go right. Of course, it will. I'll see you on the beach for certain. I don't know. I never had the feeling so strong before. I said I’ll see you on the beach. [Toplis laughing] [laughing] Beetle in sandwich! All right. It will be heavy going to Maritsa. I know. You think you can keep up? The bleeding’s stopped. - Right. - [whispers] Thanks. You'll travel through the night, won't you? Yes, of course. That means you ought to reach Maritza about... what's the time now? 2000 hours. Yes. You ought to reach Maritza about 2100 hours tomorrow. That will give you an hour to play with. I'll attack Calator at 2200 hours. But remember, it's absolutely vital that we both attack at exactly the same time. - At 2200 hours. - Yeah. Right. Well, David, this is it. [sighs] Hey, wait a minute. Hold on. - [metal clanking] - [exhales] Um... [clears throat] before you go, there's a... word I'd like to say. I made a hash of the water, but... I remembered the rum. Come on, Boyd. You're usually the thirsty one. Patroklis, come on in here. [Poole] Well... [hesitates] What I wanted to say, I... I don't know how to say. Confucius say ♪ No time to fret or cry ♪ ♪ He knows the time has come To say goodbye ♪ [all laugh] Well, here's good luck until we meet again on the beach. - [exhales] - All right, chaps, let's get ready. [Boyd whispers] So long, Basher. How many times are you going to say goodbye? Until we meet again. We'll meet again. [howling in distance] All right. You’ve got a nice night for it. Yes... romantic moon. George... You can't let him go. - What do you mean? - He's hurt. He's bleeding badly from an old wound. George... Is this true? Why didn't you tell me? Is it very bad? You’d better stay with us. Sorry, Tom... but we haven't so far to go. Yes. I'm afraid you're right. Come on. - [soldiers marching] - [soldier shouts] [airplanes roaring] [thunder, raining] This is a nice cave. The right place, the right time and plenty of water. I hope Poole is pleased too. - [rain falling] - There it is. We'll stay here. Well, better get all the rest we can. You know, if this keeps up till tomorrow, it'll be perfect. Oh, aye, perfect. I already feel like a flipping frog­man that's lost his flipping flippers. - Never mind about tomorrow. - [soldiers laughing] Here upon the well-armed soil. [Poole] Why don't you shut up and go to sleep? Yes. There's just one thing, sir. What's that? - I snore. - [sighs] - Appallingly. - [Poole laughs] All right, carry on. That’s an order. "Here upon the well-armed foreign soil and only resting on the sea, "we lie far from our country. "Not in faint retreat, "but in our own good arms, our safety lies." What is all this about? It's about people like us. [thunder] Imagine old Basher having to walk out in this. It'll kill him. He might even get pneumonia. - You have to laugh, don't you? - [snoring] What a place to live in. Some people might say the same thing about ten million chimney pots in London. But look what this country's got. Scenery and poverty. When I grew up, there was only poverty. What do you think of this country, Mr. T? Before the war? All right. I not have this. How did you get that? Kick. Boot. Good luck for me. Good luck? Me, in hospital. The others... [thunder] With your luck, you may be able to get even this time. [laughs] All right, chaps. We’ve had our rest. Come on, let's go. [airplanes roaring] They used to live this war, cloth years. Darn foreigners! Came right over us and missed us. A bullet's a bullet in any language. Come here! Now we’re here, we'd better rest. We must be fresh for going on tonight. [sighs] [truck passing] Poole ought to be at his attacking point now. We've got an hour to get to ours. Now briefly, I'll recap. We move from here to the airfield in a semicircle like this. And when the job's done, we come back in a straight line to this church here. And why the church? I thought the church would be the safest place. Happy? [in Greek] Bad luck, Captain. I'm sorry you're not coming with us then. Better wish us luck. George... Here's your route to the church. Put everything in two packs, and then bury the rest. Yes, sir. Good luck. See you in church, sir. [airplanes roaring in distance] [in Greek] We’ll never get through this way. [Poole] What do we do next? All right, we go other way. How much longer will it take? Maybe... one hour? No maybe. Come on, get moving. Every time! What can you do with these people? [airplanes roaring in distance] Now we know they meet every eight minutes. We've got that much time to get through. [Graham] Check your watches. 2159. [howling] [howling continues] [Graham] Right. - Bombs out! - [Patroklis] Take them out! Set your time fuses... now! If our bombs are to go off when the others do, we set the fuses now and like it. Travel with live bombs? Oh, that's different, isn't it? Set the fuses! We'll make it. Or beat the high jump record and no witnesses. [Graham] Come on, Boyd. Come on. Right. Right. - [dramatic music playing] - OK. [Boyd] I feel like the Lord Mayor opening a new bridge, sir. Shut up. Shut up and get on. [Graham] OK. [pensive music playing] Right. - [Graham] Good luck, Boyd. - [Boyd] You too, sir. [Graham] Come on. Remember, it all goes up in 30 minutes. Come on! Remember, you stay here. [dramatic music playing] [Poole] This is a good place. Easy to find on the way back. We dump the packs and change into plimsolls now. - Take the bombs out, Mr. Toplis. - All right. [tense music playing] [footsteps approaching] - How many does that make? - Four. Feels like 44. That one next. [dramatic music playing] Back up, back up. - [Barrett] How long have we got, sir? - [Poole] Sixty minutes. To dump all these bombs, we must take an aircraft each and get back here. Barrett... You too, Toplis. All right, me too. [Toplis grunts] Evans... [tense music playing] [panting] - [thuds] - [footsteps stop abruptly] [dramatic music playing] [panting] [panting heavily] [unscrewing] Two bombs left, sir. All right, stick them in that petrol dump we just passed. I’m going to put this one on that bomber over there. [dramatic music playing] You can't. Too near the building. You wait for me at the petrol dump. [dramatic music intensifies] [soldier in Italian] Alarm! Halt! [flare flying] - [alarm blares] - [soldiers yelling] [alarm blaring] [soldiers chattering] Go! [dramatic music playing] [soldiers chattering] [soldiers scattering] [dramatic music continues] [inaudible] [George Two] Not that way! You'll lead them to the others. [Boyd] Right, sir. This way... - [soldiers scattering] - [dramatic music playing] Come on. [gunshots] [Graham] Wait. We haven't much time. - [all panting] - [shots firing] [shots continue] [dramatic music playing] You shouldn't have done that last bomb. Now, they're caught. You shouldn’t have done it. Now, you’ve spoiled everything. It's done. Come on! [dramatic music playing] We’d better stick here for a bit. [panting] I want to keep an eye on the field. I'll go and get some water from George 1. He must be inside. [Corcoran] Captain George? Captain George? He's not here! [pants, sighs] I suppose he couldn’t make it, the poor devil. Wonder if there's any water here. [Corcoran] You’d think so. They have baptisms here all the time. [Graham] Listen! Do you hear that? What? There's someone in here. Captain George? He was hurt. - Perhaps he's passed out. - Wait a minute! Give me cover. I'll go! [woman screaming] [In Greek] [in Greek] - [woman in Greek] - No, please, please. [Graham] We're friends. Don't be afraid. [in Greek] [Patroklis] It's time, it's time, it's time! Your bombs don't work. Talk to her. Tell her we're friends. We won't hurt her. We won't do any harm. You murderers! You're not friends to anyone here. [Patroklis in Greek] Get out, run, if they catch you, they'll kill you - [in Greek] They'll kill you! - What did you tell her? - I can't hold her much longer. - [woman screaming] [bell tolling] - We’ve got to stop him! - [bell tolling] [bell continues tolling] [bell tolls in distance] [yelling in Italian] He’s right. It's all for nothing. The whole thing's a shambles. Why didn't the bombs work? [Italian soldiers yelling in distance] Well, he's crazy! They're not due to go till now. [explosions] [explosion, alarm blares] [in Greek] I was wrong! They worked! [yells] They do work! - [alarm blaring] - [explosions] - [explosions continue] - [alarm blaring] ♪ London Bridge is falling down Falling down, falling down ♪ London Bridge is falling down ♪ ♪ London Bridge is falling down My fair lady ♪ - [explosions continue] - [alarm blaring] He's gone. They must have taken him... to... Anyway, the job's done. You've only missed a pool's party. Tis well. I've lost three men out of six, possibly four. How well done's that? No one can expect to carry out a job like this without some loss, you know. You're better at telling the truth. You know it's my fault. You told me so yourself. We'd better look inside. How much trouble do we want? We taken enough chance coming this far. Well, take another chance and look inside. He may be inside. [George One] Graham. - [Graham] Is that a way out? - [George One] Yes through here. You’re alone. I thought you'd come here... Patroklis? Where is he? What has happened? He ran amok. They got him. And the others? Taken. George 2? George 2. [thumps arm] - Because of Patroklis. - No, because of me. Everything's because of me. For heaven's sake, let's get out of here. We can put him in the picture on the way. What happened here? The bells brought half the village here. I saw them from where I was hiding. Did anyone see you? Some did. But they are Greeks, and I am Greek. [chuckling] That's our only blessing. Well, so is Patroklis. He's a Greek. Let’s get out of here. We are safe here. There are a hundred pair of Greek eyes watching out for the soldiers. I'm thirsty. I'd like a drink. - [Graham] Here. - [George One] Thank you. [panting] I'm not hungry. - Have you eaten? - No. Darn it, you'll eat! Got enough dead as it is! Take it. [sighs] The war sits heavy on your stomach. I feel sick. I know. Yes. There will be butchery here because of us. [George One] People who live here and helpless may die. Perhaps us too... but we knew that. Maybe what you did here will cause fewer to die somewhere else. Don't cloak a cheap gesture with noble motives. That last bomber... needn't have done it. Fine night. They ought to be here with us now. I did it for the kick. You are in the war, Graham. Don't take the whole world on your conscience. You cannot make up the sum until the end. Yeah. But I can sum up a little of the ugly truth about myself. If it helps you. When you go, you two should go alone, without me. I'll only slow you down. And you can't afford to lose any more men. I don't intend to! You're in this war too. The whole show's a flop unless one of us gets back off this island. And as far as I know, we're the last of the ten. When we go, we go together. And we go now! Leave it. [airplane roaring] [in German] That is the work of an English Commando. [general] You have 50,000 men here. Don't let a single one of them escape. [somber music playing] [man in Italian] Ready. Ready. Italian battalion [dramatic music playing] [soldier shouts command] [dramatic music playing] Haven't seen us yet. Great. Now we can rest. We've no food and no water. We’d better use our strength getting to the rendez­vous. [trucks passing] - [dramatic music intensifies] - [soldiers shouting] [flute plays] [goats' bells clanging] [soldier shouts] [goats' bells clanging] [goats bleating] [tense music playing] [goats bleating] [playing flute] - [continues playing flute] - [tense music intensifies] [playing flute] [continues playing flute] [Italian soldier laughs] [plays both flutes simultaneously] [goats bleating] [tense music crescendos] [playing flute] Thank you! Epharistol! [playing flutes] Come on, come on! Come on! We’ll give him five minutes rest, then we'll... - we'll try and cross the road. - Right. [George] Hey, Graham! Poole's party! [George] Look! Soldiers! - We've got to warn them. - We can't! - They’re gonna walk straight into it. - If you fire, they'll get us too. - We've got to do something. - Hear what I said! - Yes, but sir. - Put down that gun! - [soldier yelling in Italian] - George, you fool! [soldier yelling in Italian] Now they'll get the lot of us. No. They'll only get me. But I walked out of their prisons before. I'll do it again. Save me a place when you go boating next. [soldier shouts in Italian] [soldier shouts in Italian] [soldier shouts in Italian] [melancholic music playing] [soldier shouts in Italian] [soldier shouts in Italian] [tense music playing] It's 2230. We've got to get to the beach in half an hour, or we'll miss the signal. Yes, sir. [dramatic music crescendos] [in Italian] Halt! Lay down your arms. You are prisoners. [in Italian] If you are found with weapons, you will be shot. [guns cock] All right, chaps. We've had it. And we were so ruddy near. [in Italian] Be quiet! Now it begins. [in Italian] [in Italian] [soldier shouts in Italian] [soldier] Come on! [fires shot] - [somber music playing] - [gasping] All right. [laughs] [somber music playing] You forgot the safety catch, Mr. Toplis. [Italian soldier] Come on! - Let's get out of here. - All right. [crickets chirping] [car revving in distance] [soldier] How many prisoners did you take? [in Italian] [in Italian] - Bye. - Bye. [car revving] [car drives off] [tense music playing] [in Italian] [dramatic music playing] How long have you been carrying me? About twenty minutes. You kept coming round and... passing out again. What about the patrols? I ducked them. [chuckles] You're quite a chap, Corcoran. Yeah, thanks to the Army. But you'll never make a soldier. No. What time is it? 2310. The sub was due at 2300 hours. You should have been down on the beach instead of lugging me around the countryside. That's where we are going... sir. [dramatic music crescendos] That's torn it. The E-boat beat us to it. Our foldboat... our dinghies. They've got the lot. Even if the sub is still there, we can't get out to there. [shouts] We can't get out there! Corcoran... Get me down there... Get me down there! - [Corcoran] All right... - [unintelligible] [whistling] [whistling continues] Search the rocks. They may not have found everything. I want some water. But they have. We saw them. - Search the rocks! - We saw them! Where are you going? I'm going to bathe my face. Then I'm going to search the rocks. I'll help you. I can manage, thank you. [whistling] Corcoran! Corcoran, they didn't get it all! Look... Look, I got these. They missed them. What do you expect to find in it? Aladdin’s Lamp? Yes. 2335: 35 minutes past rendez-vous. They'll give us more time. They're bound to. - They'll wait. - Suppose and they don't wait. They haven't waited. This is the end. And now I can give you the truth you've always asked for. And if it's not the end? I hate you. I hate you for never giving up. You don't think. You haven't even the imagination to know when you're let. Well I know when I'm let! Danger is their only kick. Well I’m leaving you here to enjoy it. [whistling] There! I saw something. There's a light out there! I didn't see anything. I saw a light. I saw it. It’s a fish leaping. They often do. I’ve seen them in the Tweed. Down! [dramatic music playing] What will we do now, Beau Geste? Shoot it out? I'm not going to finish in a prison camp. I'm swimming for it. How far do you think you’ll get? I don't know... but I'm not being taken. Well, perhaps I didn't see a light. Perhaps there's nothing there. Then I'm swimming anyway. [dramatic music playing] How long have we been? About an hour. Those mountains... don't seem any further away. [grunts] Listen... Listen! Engines! It’s a sign! It's them! We're not too late. Signal! What are you waiting for? Signal! Stevens! Quick! Come here! Take a look! Take a good look! I... I don't trust my eyes anymore. What do you see? What do you see? Nothing... Nothing... Yes, there's a light flashing a long way off. There it is again! It’s them! It must be them. - [Papadapoulus] Diving stations! - Diving stations. Diving stations. - [Papadapoulus] Stand by to surface. - Stand by to surface, sir. [water splashing] E-boat. Dive! [lieutenant] Vessel circling, constant range, 150 yards, sir. [Papadapoulus] We must dive again. [alarm blares] It'll probably be that E-Boat. Well, we'll give her a few minutes to move on then... try again. And if she doesn't move on? Are you trying to read my mind, Stevens? It's very easy to read, sir. Maybe I am crazy... but I am not that crazy! I am not going to risk my boat to save the lives of a few men. No? [Stevens chuckles] Of course, you wouldn't. No, I wouldn't. Unless... when the time comes... I change my mind. Our signals... brought her to us. Couldn't have done. She'd have stopped to pick us up. If she didn't see us, the Sub won't see us either. We've had it. I'm finished. Is this the finish? Here, like this? [panting] I'm going on. [dramatic music playing] [dramatic music playing] [in German] Submarine spotted! [dramatic music intensifies] [in German] Drop the mines now. [rumbling] [Papadapoulus speaking unintelligibly] Hard to starboard. [submarine whining] [somber music playing] [joyous music playing]
