It affects a lot of relationships, and a lot of times, it ends in divorce. Today. We're talking about infidelity and betrayal. Infidelity has been known to cause more relationship breakups than social media, and anything else, okay? What are we doing today? We are bringing out a couple, Mya and Trey. They've been in a marriage for five years, but they are experiencing some trust issues. There's been a lot of- - Bro, why are you pacing, dog? What's wrong with you? Why? Why are you pacing? Why am I pacing? Cannot believe I'm about to do this. I'm about to go out there, and tell the whole world all my business. What, bro, why are you pacing? Because I'm nervous, Mike! Nervous, dog? What, nervous for what, man? Oh, no matter what happens, you and Sydney are gonna be okay. And that's all that really matters. All I want is my family back. We have our problems, but at the end of the day, we're a family. What if Sydney's not my child, right? Aw, man. No, no, no, I mean, what if she is my child, man? I can't stand to look at Mya, man. I know you may not wanna hear this right now, but you need to think about the possibility that he might not never come back. And if that's the case, then you need to learn how to stand on your own two feet like I did. Like you did? Is that what you remember? 'Cause that's not what I remember. What I remember is you doing drugs every single night while me and Malaya raised ourselves. What I remember is you having a different guy over every single night, and You telling us to leave you alone. I remember thinking you were dead, and calling the police, 'cause we thought you were dead, and you OD'd on some coke! That's what I remember! Are you done? Or do you feel like judging me some more? You right, I messed up, and I can't take that back. I was young and I was stupid, but it doesn't take away the fact that I am still your mother. And no matter what happens, it's over, man. And nothing will never be the same. It's over? Look, man, Trey, you taking this way too personal, bro. Guys find out they're not the father every day, B. My bad. Like she said, five years Trey and Mya's been together, they got a daughter, who's six years old, Sydney. And without us going into their situation, we're gonna let Trey come out, and tell us what's going on. Trey, welcome to the show. Hi, hey guy, how you doing? Hey, how you doing? All right. How you doing, Trey? It's nice to meet you. I tried to do right by y'all, but this isn't about me. This is about you, and what you're gonna do.

Okay, well, Ms. Taylor, we know that you've had a chance to hear from backstage, and obviously, you're familiar with the story anyway. How are you feel about this whole situation? I've watched Mya give and give over and over to a man who did not appreciate her. Trey constantly took Mya for granted. You heard the charges. What did you expect her to do, Trey, seriously? I expected her to be honest with me. I expected her to give me the decency of telling me first, before she tell other people. Oh hey, how's school? - All right. - Sounds good, I missed you. Come here. Thank you. Okay, go ahead and go in your room, and let me talk to Lyndsey, okay? And thank you for picking her up for me, girl. Course, so, what are you gonna do? I mean, this thing with Trey and Mone is getting out of control. And then Sydney? Look, you need to get this under control or it's gonna destroy y'all. I don't know what to do. We were good before this happened, you know? Yeah, I mean, it just seems like all hell broke loose as soon as y'all got y'all new place. He gets laid off, and now all this drama. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to fix this, you know? And I wanna fix this. Trey did he say he wanted you to take a paternity test though, right? Right? Yeah, yeah. Y'all clearly can't be in the same room together right now, right? What is it, Lyndsey? Girl, I don't know. Why don't y'all just go on a talk show with something? What? I'm not going on a talk show. Listen, before you shut the idea down, my cousin went on there before, and she said it was cool. She said that they took care of everything, and they give you the DNA test results there. I can do a DNA test here. I mean, you can, but think about what happened last time you and Trey were in the same room together. How do you think he's gonna react when he finds out about Sydney from you? I can't do that, I can't, I'm not going on a TV show, and putting out my business in front of everybody, you know? Well, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but your business is already out there. You all right in there? Yeah, yeah, I'm good. Where's Reggie? Oh, he's gone. Can I come in for a minute? Relax, I'm about to go too. I just wanted to give you some breakfast and water before I get out of here, that's all. So, do you want me to leave it on the counter or? No, you come in, come on. What kind of girl you think I am? What? Really? Oh, nah, it's not like that, it's just that I'm sick. And so, I wasn't feeling my best, and then, thank you. Yeah, don't mention it. Yeah, don't mention it. What's up, dog? Hey, wait a minute. Hey, you got another breakfast out? You're not the one with a hangover. Wait a minute, so you mean to tell me, now I gotta be drunk and passed out like this dude in order to get a, eh, in order to get a sandwich? - What you talking about, man? - I'll see y'all later. - Man, I'm hungry, bro. - Appreciate it. Yeah, you appreciated something, all right. What, man? What? Look, don't worry about it, brother. Just get dressed, man. Reggie coming to swoop us up in a minute. All right. What? Nothing, man, hurry up, bro, come on. God is our refuge and our strength. A very present help in trouble. Trey? I know you don't wanna talk to me, and I get it, and I totally understand. But I miss you, and Sydney misses you, and I just really wish you'd come home. So, call me, please. Ma? No, I'm not all right. Can you come over? Yeah, I'll be home. Okay. I don't blame you for taking off though, 'cause what happened with Trey last night was just so embarrassing. Girl, everybody's been talking about it. What are you talking about? Girl, you didn't hear about that video on World Star? Everybody's been sharing that on Facebook. What video? When was this? Girl, a couple nights ago. Then on top of that, Mone got shot last night. Mone got shot, what are you talking about, what? Yeah, girl, you didn't hear about this? So you didn't talk to Trey? Bro, I know it's one of these cars. It was a silver, it's like a silver like Hyundai, or a Camry or something. Like, what year though? Was it like old or was it like newer? Nah, bro, it's like, probably like a 2011 or something like that, maybe a '12, I don't know, I don't know. It's a newer car, bro. All I know is she better not lie to me, man. I really wanna just make sure like the car here. Just so, you know what I'm saying? So we ain't here for no reason to get set up or something. Right, I feel you. Sup? Well, all I know is she better not lie to me, bro. She better not lie to me, man, I know she was in the studio. I know for a fact she was in the studio with Reggie then, bruh. Look, we just gotta ask her some questions. She just hanging back, man. Yeah, 'cause I know you. Bro, I'm telling you, she just better not lie to me. Hey yo, you sure she doesn't come out around here? Oh, she get off at four o'clock, we could've took, oh, there she go, right there. Right there. Turn right there, go pull up on her. Hell yeah. No, she going flip-flopping, bro, I'm telling you, dog. All she do is hop the clique, I know she was there with them, bro. She was trying to be with us, now she wanna be in the studio with Reggie, and I know she was there with them, bro. They're giving an opportunity to hos. Yeah, I know that though. I ain't trying to hear that, bro, I'm trying to see what happened. Then don't do nothing unless I tell you. 'Cause I know you. Hey, she don't even see us. Yeah, don't go, let her go to the car. She don't even see us. Oh, she better not lie to me. I mean. Nah, she know better than that. I mean, she better Hey ma, thanks for coming. Of course. I'm here too, but you're welcome. Hey sis. So, what's going on? Sounded urgent. Trey left me last night. Trey left you? I don't think he's coming back. I don't know what to say. What happened? He found out about me and Mone. You and Mone, Mya? How did he even find out about you and Mone six years later? And then he's got the nerve to leave you? This was his fault. He's the one that got locked up. What did he expect you to do, just be alone and struggle? Boy's been a mess from the start. You know, maybe if you were taking your crazy pills, and going to therapy like the doctor told you, you wouldn't be in this mess. Shut up, Malaya. Baby don't need no pills. She does if the doctor says she does. Well, what did the doctor say? Tried to say she has borderline personality disorder. He did not try to tell her, he told her she was crazy a long time ago. I mean, it's obvious, she can't stay in a stable relationship, and she's always making impulsive decisions. You're gonna quit talking about me like I'm not sitting right here. I'm crazy, Malaya, huh? If I'm crazy, then what are you? 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, you were the one out there sniffing coke, right? Okay, we're not talking about me. I'm just saying, you're talking about me like you think- We're not talking about me, we're talking about you. Why don't you stick to your prescribed pills? Not the ones you use to get high? Oh my, I cannot believe you, you're gonna judge me? That's your house right there? It's nice, bro, y'all are really moving up. ♪ I've been tripping ♪ Hey, man, I thought Mya was at work, bro. Man, I thought she was, man. Look like her mom here too. And if her mom here, Lyndsey gonna be here too. ♪ And tripping ♪ Just stop it! There's too much going on right now for all of that. Mya, tell me what happened between you and Mone. When Trey went back to jail, I wasn't working, so I started kicking it back with Mone, so I could get some help. He was helping me out with money, but I told him over and over and over that it was only until Trey got home. And I don't know, I guess he caught feelings or something. Well, why didn't you say anything to Mone? Exactly. He's the one with the money, and was looking out way more than Trey's bros, so. Everything's not always about money, Malaya! Trey's always loved me, and I've always loved him. I'm not trying to mess that up. I don't know what I'm gonna do if Sydney is not his daughter. So Mone thinks Sydney is his. Yeah. But what if he's right? Then she is. It's not that simple! Mone's in the hospital. He got shot last night after getting into it with Trey and Reggie. Sure you wanna go in? Yeah, man, I'mma just run in and grab my stuff. I'll be right back. Hey, hey, hey, Trey. If Lyndsey in there, tell her Mike said, what's up. Yeah, Mike. Good luck. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Everything is so messed up right now. Stop worrying about it. Like I said, this is all his fault. We're here for you. Thought you was gonna be at work. We need to talk, Trey. Nah, I'm through talking, especially not in front of them. Excuse me? I don't mean no disrespect, Ms. Taylor, it's just that this is between me and your daughter. Come in, we'll go in the room and talk. - Yeah, that sounded- - Are you good? I'm good. We'll be right here. Okay. What is it, Mya? I ain't got long. Why you didn't tell me you got into it with Mone at the club? I know you not talking to me about Mone, and keeping things from you. So, you gonna act like none of this is your fault, huh, Trey? Like everything was perfect before you got locked up? You know what? What am I supposed to do? I'm just supposed to be like, oh, it's okay, baby, it's okay, you made a mistake and we good, right? Okay, and what am I supposed to do, huh? Just forget all the times you got locked up, Trey? You don't know what you put me through, Trey. I was the one that bailed you out. I was the one at court. I was the one that put money on your books! So you did all that with my money, right, Mya? Or did you forget, huh? What you want, I took care of you. I took care of us, I stopped hustling, I got a job, and you wanna act like a whole another person, and then you're the one who told me to stop in the first place! I did that for you. And then I get laid off, and you wanna just lose respect for a brother. I know what you want. You want me out there in them streets. You know what? You ain't no different than your sister. Don't do that, do not do that, do not bring my sister into this. What was I supposed to do, Trey? When you was locked up, me and Sydney, we barely had money for food, we barely had money for bills, let alone money for a lawyer! And that makes it okay to cheat on me? That makes it okay for you to go sleep with somebody else, get pregnant, and not know who the father is, and then put that on me? What you need to do is lower your voice when you talking to my daughter. Okay, you know what? I'm sorry, Ms. Taylor, but your daughter is wrong, all right? She was supposed to be down for me, but she'd go sleeps with Mone of all people? At least he has money. That's typical coming from you. You got something you wanna say to her? Yeah, actually, I do. If you wasn't so thirsty, and minded your own business, maybe you'd get a decent man. Don't talk to my sister like that. You wanna know the truth, Trey, huh? Maybe if you wasn't so busy running in the streets, I wouldn't have had to ask nobody else to help me! Girl, don't play with me. Don't play with you, Trey? What you gonna do? - Mya. - What? What you mad about? 'Cause somebody like Mone can hold me down better than you? Oh, what you say to me, Mya? Trey, you better take your hands off my daughter right now! Now! And I ain't even come here for all this. Just came to get my stuff. Well, get your stuff, and get the hell out. Yeah, all right. What's going on, y'all? Hey everybody, aw, man, that's how we gonna start 2017? I was just trying to use the bathroom. Come on, Mike. Where you going? I can't go take a piss? Mike, let's go!

I've watched Mya give and give over and over to a man who did not appreciate her. Trey constantly took Mya for granted. Hello? You heard the charges- - Not much. Not one more time, all right? I expected her to be honest with me. One hour? I expected her to give me the decency of telling me first before she tell other people! Hello? Hello? So let's say if she did, would you have- - What'd he say? Would you still have married her? Maybe, I mean, I don't know, but at least I would've known the truth, all right? Y'all gotta get out.

All right, I'm gonna get that video to my contact at the news. I'll call you as soon as I find something out. Family of Mya Jackson? I'm her husband. Hi, I'm Dr. Fields. I'll need to talk to you alone, please. Okay, so, how's my wife, doc? Well, Mya sustained a head injury, some broken ribs, and her lungs collapsed. It's touch and go right now. This next 24 hours is gonna be very critical. But she's gonna be all right though, right? I mean, you gotta bring it back to me, okay? I mean, you can fix her, right? I mean, promise me you can fix her. All I can promise you is that we're going to do everything that we can for her. Any idea on how all this happened? It appears that she had an overdose of prescription medication, which may have affected her driving. Prescription pills. Yes. We looked through her record, and Mya has a diagnosis of a borderline personality disorder, and she's receiving medication for it. But we also found oxycodone in her system. Wait, wait, wait, wait. So you're telling me that my wife is mentally ill? Well, yes, well, about one in four adults suffer from some type of mental illness. And Mya's no different in that regard. But she's under treatment and she should be okay. Now, we need to focus on her injuries, and then we can look at her possible addiction, and treatment of her other diagnosis. All right, thank you, doc. No problem. Are we gonna see mommy? I don't know, baby. - What's going on, man? - Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey, hang on, bro. It's the pastor, man. What's going on? Hey, thanks for coming, pastor. Hey, no problem, what'd the doctor say? Oh, she got a lot of injuries, and it ain't looking good. Hey, you gotta watch what you say. No matter what the doctor says, we have to believe the report of the Lord. We know that Jesus came, and he died on the cross for our sickness in our infirmities. And no matter what the doctors say, we have to believe that God is who he said he is. He's every single thing that we need in every situation. Yeah, well, pastor, I need him to be a lot of things for me right now. I mean, I can't tell whether I'm coming or going. And I found out something. Some terrible news about Mya that could change our relationship forever. And he even the doctor said that she has a mental illness, and maybe even an addiction. Hmm. You gotta ask yourself, Trey, what's too hard for God? Even though things seem to be going terribly, like the world is crushing down on our shoulders, we know that all things work together for good, for those that love God, and for those that are called according to his purpose. Do you wanna tell me what's going on? Gotta give it to this boy, it's gonna stop. Nah, we about to get these things, dog. Fuck that. Thinking of stunning these niggas up. There's no getting away with that, bro. I don't know what to say. I wish I knew what to do. Pastor, he says, no matter how big the situation, God can take our mess and turn it into a message. I don't know how I feel about that though. You were wrong. No doubt, but I should've been there for my family. Instead of hanging out with my boys and acting all reckless. And maybe what you did was worse. But love keeps no record of wrong. Look, I don't know what I'm saying, I. Baby, I just, I need you to get better, so we can figure this thing out together, please. Just. You okay? Yeah, I'm good as I'm gonna be. Any updates? The most critical thing is her head injuries right now. It ain't sounding good though. Every time I'm here, you're here. Have you been home? I don't have a home anymore, Mrs. Taylor. I know I've made a lot of mistakes, and I know I didn't always do right by Mya, but I love her. That I do. What about Sydney? I know she misses you. I miss her too. It's just that it's, I don't know, it's hard right now, okay? Seeing her, and not knowing. But I appreciate you. You and Malaya watching over her, I do, thank you. Of course, but she needs you. No matter the situation, you're still her father. Hey, excuse me, I'm looking for a Mya Jackson. Mya Jackson? Hey, found the strat. It's about to go down. She is in room 225, down the hall to the right. Okay, thank you. Hey baby. Hey. You okay? You worried about mommy? Yes. Well, mommy, she's just a little hurt right now. But no matter what, we gonna be all right. Do you believe me? Yeah. Gimme another hug. I love you, baby. I love you too. Mya wanted me to make sure that you got this letter she wrote you after the talk show. This also has the results of the paternity test. Thank you. Take care of my girl. If you're just tuning in, here's a breaking news update about the shooting at the Lux. How's she doing? Not so good, but you know. We hope. Hey, you know what I'm saying? She's a champ, man, y'all done been through worse than this. She's gonna pull through, man, she's gonna be all right. Listen though. I know this not the right time. Dog, I need a huge favor. A favor? Right now, bro? Listen, I understand, I'm just, I need you, you all I got right now. Man, what's going on? What you need, man? I need you to hold his bad for me real quick. Are you serious, Reggie?

I got too much going on. Listen- - What's up with Mike? Ask Mike to hold the bag. I can't do that right now, all right? I gotta go holler at Mike about something else. I'm just asking you is my mans. Can you do me this favor? Bro, I just got too much going on right now, I can't- - Dog, you don't think I see that? I understand, Trey, I'm right here with you, but I need this favor real quick. Look, I can't hold a bag. I'm not doing that, not here. Come on, dog, you acting soft. Dog, she got you acting like this? What you mean? 'Cause you don't even know if the baby yours yet, What? I got the results right here, I'll find out, man, if the baby mind or not, all right? But I'm not holding no bag. I'm not doing that right now while my wife is sitting here on her deathbed, man!
