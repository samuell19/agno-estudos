Much more work needs to be done, but it's up to other women with other experiences, younger women, it's up to them to write new books. We clearly need many more books on women's issues. Books written by other women, not by me. Be Beautiful and Shut Up Be Beautiful and Shut Up Never, never. Being an actress is as low as you can go. You wouldn't have been an actor if you were a boy? No, never. I would have thought it's not something you do if you're a boy. It was considered sissy then. They called you a sissy. Yes. So you went into acting because you were a girl? I always ask myself that question. For a woman, being an actress... Why is something considered frivolous for a man but considered less frivolous for a woman? But listen I think that we believe all of this because being an actress can be absolutely wonderful. But what's happening today in film, in theatre, everywhere has got stuck. How do you say stuck? “Coincé."” It's stuck in another century No, I don't think so. If it was I would have packed up my bags and left long ago. It's something I've always felt. When I was small I always regretted not being a boy. In the sense that, because... what I was looking for in the cinema was a reason for living. Something to give me strength, to protect me. I didn't have that as a girl, because there was so much aggression from boys and all that. I felt that boys were free to do what they wanted without being in danger physically or sexually. They could sleep in the streets, which was something I wanted to do. As a girl, I couldn't do that because I was wearing a dress, people would see my underwear. Stupid things like that. How would I go to the toilet? All those kinds of things, at that kind of level. Sex and all that was a pain. I wasn't up to all that. If I was a boy, I would definitely have left to go and live somewhere else. I always wanted to travel, to go off somewhere, to explore. You don't know what you'll find. You can go away from here or explore things here which I did through the cinema. I would have left physically, all on my own. I would have gone off to sea. I would have taken any job as a sailor. That's a very good question. Would I have ...7 No! First of all... Because I... I probably would have been less narcissistic. Although it's not true either. Lots of boys today are very narcissistic. I think I would have been a sailor. Why do you think that? I don't know. I always felt that. I was drawn to the sea. I love... Even today, I still love being on a boat. I love travelling. My life would have been different. A different life? Yes. If I was a man I would never have been an actor. I'm sure. No, because I would have had more inner strength as a man. More strength and less... Do you think you lack inner strength or that your inner strength would have been fully expressed? The reason I think this is that I left home at 16 to go on a dance tour as a dancer, through Africa. I left with the clear intention of hitchhiking around Africa. I thought to myself, my trip to Dakar is paid. I'll do my 2-month contract in Dakar and then I'll head off. I'll finish my 2 months, which will pay for my trip and then I'll head off and travel round the whole of Africa. I was really looking forward to it. And then, since my ballet masters were really tough. When I let it be known that I wanted to break my contract they forced me to continue. I was even beaten. Intimidated and beaten. They forced me to continue. We came back through North Africa. In Casablanca they were withholding my salary. I needed that money but half of my salary was withheld. Knowing I had told friends that I wanted to leave. I had let it be known. So they were witholding money from me. For no reason. In the end, I had to leave without my money. At one point, I realised that I had enough and I would never get out. So I left. My flight was paid by someone who knew about my problem and I came home. To come back to the question, if you were a boy? But if I had been a boy I would never have left with that ballet because I think... In any case, it would have been different. I would obviously have hit back. If I had been a male dancer they would not have tried to control me like they tried to do. I'll never forget the first day I went to Warner Brothers for a... for a makeup test. It was my first time in front of a camera. They put me in this chair all actresses are familiar with this, a chair that looks a lot like a dentist's chair. Lots of lights on your face and all these men standing around like surgeons. Men standing around like surgeons? Yes, you see all these people. The heads of makeup departments of the biggest Hollywood studios. Really well-known people who had created all the big stars. Garbo, Lombard and the rest. They were working on my face. Then they lifted me up. And I didn't recognise myself. It was like I was coming off an assembly line with my eyebrows all over the place. Lips like eagle wings. They were enormous. They said I'd have to dye my hair blonde. That was the way it had to be. And... and also... Oh, they wanted me to have my jaw broken by a dentist To hollow out your cheeks. To hollow out your cheeks. I had lovely teenage cheeks. And... Joshua Logan was the director and was also my godfather. My godfather. One day, he said "You'll never play in a tragedy, because a nose like that cannot be taken seriously!" The word came from on high that Jack Warner, the studio head wanted me to wear false breasts. He didn't like women with small breasts. It was clear that I was a commercial product and they could do anything to make me more commercial. They were to invest a lot of money in me. In any case, they didn't change my jaw or my nose. But I did wear false breasts, dye my hair and eyebrows for 10 years. Which meant that I, Jane Fonda, was here and this image was there and there was this alienation between the two. The only parts I'm offered are schizophenics, crazies, lesbians, murderers, that sort of thing. That don't really interest me anymore. I don't know. I'd like to make less serious films. Less serious? A film like "Céline et Julie vont en bateau". Yes, I would have loved to do that. I'd also like to work with men... If I work with male partners I want them to be my age. Be more... I mean even Nicholson is better than Brando. But it's not great. He's 40, or almost. - How old are you? -23 They're always prostitutes or alcoholics, wasted women, abandoned women, drained women. I made a film this summer. The part of a prostitute. I had to get dressed up in historical costumes. I had to go swimming in a river and came out with the clothes clinging to my body. In the background the sun was setting. I had to use this little girl voice. I didn't want to do it that way and I improved it a lot. But they kept saying, you're too serious. But I wasn't serious. The character was 35 years old. She had a series of lovers. Didn't she ask herself questions? Especially as this was 1837 or something like that. What did she do for contraception? The director thought I was mad. "No one thinks that way." I said, yes, they do. Has she had children? How does she manage? What is her life all about? It won't be in the script but it's important that I know all that. No. "It's what men like". That's what they always say. "Men like dirty women'". That was supposed to sum it up. I was so demoralised by that. By what I had to do. It was horrible. It never stops. They're left-wing, OK and all that. They're good directors. I was chosen for the starring role. My first film as a star in Hollywood. I thought it was so dramatic. It was nothing like what I'd known at the Actor's Studio. The only thing that mattered were my looks. Suddenly, all my insecurities were out in the open again, and took control. It was a big Hollywood film, a comedy. I had to play the part of a riduculous woman. The type of woman who doesn't really exist. It was 1958 or 1959, at a time when... Well, we still do it now but less often, fortunately. Films where girls were looking for a man. Ridiculous Hollywood comedies where I was a cheerleader. How do you say "cheerleader"? It doesn't exist in French. Girls who were fans of a team... Yes, of athletes when they played big... Games Major games. They wear these very short skirts and say... They're the sorts of parts I used to play. If women started writing a lot of things would change. I've talked to people like Truffaut and other people like that. They say that women end up scaring them. They no longer understand women with all the women's movements. They no longer know how to write for them. Truffaut agrees. Women have to take their destinies in their own hands. They have to write for themselves, about what they feel and want. 'What they want to obtain. And it has to come from women. That's the principle he works on. I think there are quite a few people who think like that. So we need writers today. We have to start writing. Annie Duperey, for example, has written a novel. It started off as a screenplay but she couldn't get it made. So it became a novel. It has great female characters. In the old days, in the 40's when the really wonderful women's films were being made with Rosalind Rusell, Joan Crawford, strong women. Women with sex appeal? Yes, but they had masculinity too. They had jobs, they were mayors or bank directors. They were in politics. At the time we had the Hays Office, a censorship board. You weren't allowed to show a double bed with two people undressed. One of the parties had to have a foot on the floor. Not completely on the bed. So with scenes in the bedroom you couldn't really see much. They therefore wrote parts for women outside the bedroom. That's why we had such great parts. Today, we have a different system. Men are running the studios, writing the scripts, directing and producing the films. The fantasies they want to see are the women in the bedroom. The freedom from censorship backfired. Women were back in the bedroom and they never got out. Never, never. I have the impression that I've never played a part that reflects my deeper self. The core of myself. I have never shown my real self on film. Why not? It's because of the directors. I think... They don't... The directors? Directors have no idea of what I'm really about. No idea at all. And you can feel that, subconsciously. Actresses work a lot in other people's productions. I wouldn't say my career has followed a path in the service of directors. They're not interested in me anyway. That's why I often wonder, "Am I an actress?" I've always wondered how you could manage to... It doesn't mean much, it's only show business... To have a name? How could you have a name or even be well-known by simply taking your clothes off? It's important to ask the question. But, for me, it was different. For me, it meant... doing a minimal amount of staging to get into my fantasies. To know what it means to take your clothes off to dance like a sacred Egyptian dancer. Everyone has a childhood fantasy. When I started, the first time I took my clothes off in public, I was 15 years old. So I still had a lot of childhood fantasies. Little by little I improved the staging. I managed to find a form of expression that was important for me. Whenever I'd take a theatre class to learn how to act which was after all my aim I never found what I was looking for. I was glad to be earning a living from something I wanted to do. I was independent. I was even having a good time. It was enough that... I mean I was working. I did the staging, the lights, my costumes. I'd come out on stage and it worked well with the public. I didn't have any hassles with middlemen. I'd go to the cash desk and get my money. The next day, I'd be back. I'd do my show. And it all worked well. Later on, when I was in the theatre it was all so complicated in intellectual terms. It wasn't enough just to be an actress, to try and enter into a character and act well. In so far as you're able, to do the best you can. In a way, they want you to be... To be something that... they want you to be something you're not. I didn't have much, it's true but what I did have, I wanted to keep. I was sure of that. As a result it led to a lot of psychological complications of all kinds. At one point I realised it was always the same old story with the directors, the actors. What they always wanted from me was the game where I say, "Yes, I'm so stupid, I have so much to learn from you." At some point there was a crisis because I didn't know who I was anymore. Everybody else seemed to know because they kept telling me, "This character, don't worry, it's you." But if it was me. They shouldn't have told me. When I saw the film I thought no, don't tell me it's " The Chinese girl ". That's not me at all. You see. Bertolucci created that part. He had me made up with two dark lines here. Knowing that if you put make up on a very young girl who isn't ready for it yet it makes her look cheap and perverse. He knew that. Did you know that? I realised that, during... because... we had improvised certain things but for most of the film I'd arrive for the lighting and then they'd start filming. There was absolutely no discussion or explanation. Whereas... Bernardo, personally worked with Marlon on the film. They made the film together, in a way. You see? They have no idea about women. No idea about life, about love. About what really counts. They never question themselves. They're conditioned by the past. I acquired a certain taste then. That is an enormous problem, in the measure in which women are not... must really... It's not new, what I'm saying, But... there's one small woman part for five men parts. So if in addition one becomes choosy without being a super star... That is to say, without being somebody that brings in money... In France who are we talking about? Who is there? There's Romy Schneider, there's Annie Girardot and then... maybe Catherine but after that, that's it. Then, if one becomes difficult, you ask yourself, how can I keep on doing this job? Or even, if I will keep on doing this job. Men are generally misogynists. They want to bend you to their will so they feel they exist. It's not about education or improving someone's mind. Break them down so that you can feel bigger. That's what I felt. Then I became a stripteaser. The first time I did my act I spent a week changing the whole thing. In the beginning, I was bound by the structure they gave me. So I tore it apart. The fact that I did that suddenly made it much better. I was told it was much better. That's when I realised I was going to be truer to myself to what I feel or want to do. The way I want to do it. After that, I did everything myself. The music halls accepted that. It suited them in fact. You realised that very young! Yes, I was very young. I had this fag ballet master always doing the same things. It wasn't really me. It wasn't the same thing in terms of sexuality. He'd show me things but it wasn't necessarily how I felt. It didn't feel right. But he wasn't going to take me into account. Later on, I created acts for other girls. Whenever I did that the girls were really happy and the acts were a success. The parts are so badly written. You have the body of a 40-year old, or a 45-year old, but inside it's like you're a 2-year old. That's what's so terrible. That's what makes it grotesque. If such parts do exist I've never played them. There are parts written for 40-year old women. I don't mind the way my face is or my body. But what I'm saying also has to sound 40 years old and not like a little girl. The fact that men dominate today could be the expression of an overt homosexuality. In the past, it was much more hidden. But today, it's no longer a bad thing to be homosexual. Even in California homosexuality is not that open. Do you think John Wayne would accept his films being labelled homosexual? Never. So then... Never, no. So it's not that open? No, what I wanted to say was that, in almost all films made today the subject is two men. You always have two men. Two of them! Paul Newman and Robert Redford Steve McQueen and Paul Newman Robert Redford and Steve McQueen There are always two of them. In the past directors might have wanted to make films like that. But they would have been worried. People might say, " Two men together? They must be homosexuals!" But today, you can do that because homosexuality is more in the open. You don't have to worry about being called homosexual. When you say "homosexual” you mean a male homosexual? Yes, a man. It's very different for women. Male homosexuality. Because men dominate everything. In the arts, in business, in politcs, men dominate. The producers are men, the technicians are men, the directors are men, most of them are men. The press is mixed but it's still a majority of men. The agents are men. Those in charge who give you a script, who give you advice are men. And the subjects they have are also for men. The studios haven't shut down but the main problem today is that they're not making any films with women. All the stars are men. Paul Newman, Steve McQueen my brother Warren Jack Nicholson, Marlon Brando. Lately the films have all been men in America. It's been love stories between two men, endlessly. It's been horrible. Charlton Heston maintains a very big career. If he had been a woman would he have maintained the same career? No. Absolutely not. There are very few women who can survive. If you seem to be over 35 years old, you are over, you fall in a category, of very few parts. And there's nothing to do about it. And... very boring parts. First of all, there're no parts for women, or there're parts for "ingénues", always the masculine phantasm. Or... the part of the tired housewife. Pure clichés, only the name changes. What would you say about 60-year old actors that continue to play romantic parts? Romantic parts? I find that funny. But then, why not? Why wouldn't they continue playing romantic heroes? After all, cinema is one enormous masculine phantasm. It's logical for them to continue. What can you do with a 40-year old woman, or 50 or 60-years old? She has no place in the masculine phantasm, so, she is eliminated. It's a show for men, by men, then, forget it! I have a reputation for being someone difficult. Too rigid. With a kind of aura of sexuality that is very disturbing for all those inhibited people. It's not their fault, and it's not mine either. They say I'm castrating just by looking at me. They say that men and women feel castrated by me. It's something I give off. Do you feel castrated? It's really strange. You must have come across this before. You're an actress working with a director who thinks you're right for a part. There's always a point where I forget the situation. I start talking about the script. Thinking how I feel about it, without going so far as to say it's good or it's bad. It's just what I think. But it's seen as being aggressive. By the other. They feel you're saying something that you're not saying at all. They think you're saying it's garbage but it's not that at all. You're just thinking about things that he'd probably accept from his wife or from his sister but not from an actress. Hardly from an actress. I think. Would he accept it from his wife? He probably wouldn't accept it from his wife either. But in any case, it would be much harder to accept from an actress he wants to hire. I also teach at the University of Los Angeles and I had a course just for women on production. We invited women from all aspects of the movie industry. Screenwriters, assistant directors, actresses, camera women. About 3 or 4 years ago the women's liberation movement really started to go into all aspects of American society. They were beginning to rebel. Few women were admitted into film schools. Those who were admitted were tolerated. Don't lift this, don't lift that. What do you know about cameras? It was okay if they wrote or acted, but nothing else. So they rebelled. They needed to identify themselves with other women in the industry other than actresses or screen writers. In our course we had a woman who was doing her masters at directing school. She was teaching directing. We had a camera woman. We had an editor. We had Polly Plait, an artistic director. We had Lee Grant, of course. Eleanor Perry. Gloria Goldsmith, a screen writer. The idea of the course was to help the young women get some courage by learning what it was to work in the film industry. To encourage them by showing these women who had already been struggling. Who had opened up the way. Who were avant garde. An interesting thing happened. Lee Grant's husband who produces and directs commercials. Joe Feury is his name. He came one night, which was very courageous as there were only women there. One girl said, "You'd never hire me as a grip." And he said, "Of course not. You wouldn't be able to lift heavy things and all that." And she said, "Yes I could." They had a heated discussion and he said, "Come along tomorrow morning at 7 and you'll see. And I'll show you." Well, she showed up at 7 o'clock and everyone treated her like a hothouse flower. Don't lift this, don't lift that. And she did everything. And the guys, some of the guys had been working for 30 years. When they saw that they couldn't believe it. The idea of the course was to give them a sense of what to expect. All the tricks to expect. For example, one woman was second assistant director. She was doing a wonderful job but the production manager wouldn't promote her to first assistant director. I don't remember, it was in television. He said, "What you're doing is fine but you're a woman and I don't want women in responsible positions; That's it." He was an old man, part of the old guard in Hollywood. She worked well but he didn't care. Well, you see the way the film industry is set up is for a man's pace. Up at 6 in the morning and in bed at 12. And up again at 6. You work with a male crew and it's tough. Physically it would be very draining on a woman. But as far as the creative side is concerned knowing placements and where it's going how to cut to something, I think they would be marvellous every one of them. You would see different styles. You would see a feminine spirit which is as universal as men's but it would be a different style. A different rhythm. Eleanor Perry and Frank Perry wrote, produced and directed "David and Lisa" which made them famous. And then another film I don't remember the title. The story of four teenagers on a beach and one of the girls is raped. Just a beautiful film. She did all the writing and he directed. Okay. They're not young. They've got grown up kids and they've recently divorced. The sadness in that women is incredible. For all those years, she had the talent and he was getting all the glory. It became clear when they broke up. She kept writing but she has problems now doing what she wants. She was at MGM to produce her film but she was pushed to the sidelines. She was 50 years old with a fantastic reputation. She wasn't a beginner. Because she didn't have her husband to be in the forefront, she was getting pushed aside like she was someone trivial. I think it's very interesting that he hasn't done anything great since they broke up. I've seen all of his films and I can't think of anything that was as good as when they were together. It's something to think about. In the meantime, she's sad. She says she always put herself in the background. She said that openly to the class. That she was a good wife, that she wrote that she discussed his directing while at the same time she was raising the kids. She had two jobs as all professional women do while he was getting all the glory. She worked all day long and then made him dinner at night. I mean, it's ridiculous. It's a series for national TV that's going to have a revolutionary effect. I've seen three episodes and they are so powerful. So powerful. It's called "Shoulder to Shoulder" "Shoulder to Shoulder" about the women's suffrage movement in Britain. How they fought for the right to vote. Who wrote it? Midge MacKenzie conceived it. She wrote the first episodes. Now other people are involved. - Are the writers women? - Most likely. Surely Midge knows what she's doing. It's incredible what she's donel She wrote them and produced them and had a say in the casting. It's beautifully cast and beautifully acted. It's so beautiful and so powerful. You've never seen women like this on film. Never for our own cause. We've seen women be heroic for a moment but always in a male framework. Usually it's for the sake of a man because they're in love with a man. Not because of her ideal or for her conception of what reality should be. It's so well acted and well written and conceived. We see women fighting and they're so powerful. They care intensely about themselves their whole lives that they're ready to sacrifice. You see them in the prisons. You see them being force-fed. When they went on hunger strike they would force feed them for months. They actually reenacted it and it's a pure torture technique. What they were force-feeding them with was so disgusting. The whole thing... I really believe is a revolution. All these signs of ageing are not a problem for me. I want to take control of my career in the future. I no longer accept parts or hardly ever. If I do accept a part I want to be in control. I want to know exactly what it's about. Sometimes I think I'd like to play a character the kind of woman with the type of problems that I've experienced or that other women have experienced. I'm going to write them or have them written by other women. I'm going to go it alone. I'm forced to do that because physically speaking I can't do those films anymore. All those ridiculous women! It's discrimination against myself and against these women who aren't really like that. There's something wrong. Out of 17 films I've almost always played women who curse or were alcoholics. Something's not right with Quebec cinema or with its filmmakers. So I'm going to go it alone. It was also interesting when I directed this film at the American Film Institute. I only did it because I was invited and I thought, why not? When I got on the set after a while I thought, this is terrific! How come I never wanted to do this before? What's the matter with me? I talked with other women in the group and everybody had the same feeling. We realised that it had never occured to any of us that we could be directors. Girls don't say, "I want to be a director when I grow up." They want to be actresses or air hostesses, cooks or dress designers but not directors. It's not in our programming. When the American Film Institute wanted to invite women to their classes they asked a female excecutive at the University to give them a list of names of women who were active in the industry but not directors. After she gave them the list they asked her: "What about you?" And she replied: "Oh no, I couldn't. I'm not a director.” And they said: "Neither are the others." So she thought, why not? When she got in the workshop she said: "I want to be a director.” This is terrific. That's what we all thought. Why have we never done this before? It's the best job in the industry. We all wanted to direct but not necessarily to the exclusion of everything else. I want to talk to them, make them listen. Which never happens, or almost never. Yesterday Chris Marker didn't listen to me at all. He wasn't interested in this woman who was me. I want them to listen to me. I want them to give me something new. Which is very rare. Only women ever bring me anything new. Really. I am very excited by their presence. I'm really buzzing when I meet the women I work with in Montreal. It's very important for me. I have friends. Men, couples, but it's always the same. They always talk about the same things: an independent Quebec, the Marxist struggle. I tell them about what interests me. They find it amusing. But at some point, it feels like, I mean it's like. We're talking for the sake of talking but it's just talk. Apart “Celine and Julie” have you ever had a part that involved a friendship between female characters? No, never. Apart "Celine and Julie". I'm always with other female characters. I made one film that was supposed to be very feminine, "La cavale™ a film about Albertine Sarrazin, which I consider was a failure. They wanted to do a film that was both commercial and artistic. But the film turned out to be a second death for Albertine Sarrazin. What's really awful is that they did it through me which I couldn't bear. I wanted to show her as a rebel and her relationship with the girls. I knew I could play that part because of the psychological state I was in, which was very, very bad. So I asked the director and the producer to bring out that rebellious side. It would have resulted in a film that was unbearable for the establishment, who had celebrated Albertine Sarrazin as a writer. It could have been really powerful but still very real. I wanted to avenge Sarrazin's murder. It could have been extraordinary with all the girls involved who were all drop outs. The sort of girls in my boarding school, except that these were adults. The same type of disturbed girls and I knew exactly what made them tick. But the director refused. Even though I was new to film I wasn't allowed to talk to the other actresses who had so much more experience and talent than I did because they'd all been working for years. He therefore officially cut off any contact between us. I ignored him anyway because no one gives me orders. I talked with them anyway but only on a general level and not in relation to the film. So it was a failure. That was the only time I could have had a relationship with other women. I made other films, but I didn't really understand who I was. In one film... no, I didn't even have any scenes with other women. They were there but, no. Not that I remember. If I did, nothing stands out in my mind. It happened much later. That's when I made "Celine and Julie". We ourselves said it was a women's film. Jacques is in fact a woman in that respect. He's so sensitive, not at all like other men. He gave us complete freedom to create, write, improvise, everything. He was almost like a machine, you could say like a camera. He wasn't there as a man. Except when he insisted that we include other characters. We only wanted to have the two girls. Two girls alone. Just the two of us. We thought that we were going to play all the parts you could think of for a woman, the full range of what was possible for women acting in film. All the different human relationships that were possible. As there were no men involved we played out all that out among women. Jacques insisted on the house with the spirits. That was something that we never planned, and that we didn't want. Absolutely not. It turned out to be interesting in film terms. The film in the film, you could say. But we ourselves, wanted to keep the concept of two girls spending summer in Paris with nothing to do but work with each other. What shall we do? And who were also friends. That was our starting point and we went really far in exploring that on all levels. We had total control of what was going on. That's why the film is so powerful. It all came out exactly the way it was. The way we planned it. In spite of us and because of us at the same time. I've spent most of my life acting with women. I was always in girls' schools and had never even acted with men before leaving college. I did every scene. The play I told you about I acted in it 10 times because of the female roles. At school, I always acted with women. Professionally, I've acted with men. In class, it was women. We played every possible scene "The Maids", "Hedda Gabbier" that we could find with women. In "Othello", Desdemona has a scene with Emilia, a lovely scene. In all 3 films I worked with men as partners. I've never had women partners. I always had a guy as a partner. In "Fat City" Jeff Bridges was my partner in all my scenes. In "American Graffiti", Charlie Martin Smith was my partner in all my scenes. In “The Man who fell to Earth" I worked with David Bowie, Rip Torn and Buck Henry. Did your partners have scenes among themselves? Buck Henry had a scene with a man, Trevor. Rip Torn had lots of scenes with girls because he was a ladies' man. Were there any scenes between men? Yes, Rip Torn had scenes with Bowie. Bowie had scenes with Buck. So they had scenes together but the women didn't. No. Never. You're asking such fantastic questions! I have to write them down so I can think about them more. Have I played parts where I was warm towards other women? Well, first of all, it's very rare to have other female parts. In American theatre, the disproportion of parts between men and women. It's a jokel Let me think for a minute... In that play I was a horrible woman. No, in all my other parts they're always my enemies. There's always this thing between women, sisters. Sister is not a good word. That I live with my sister is quite shocking. Most people can't understand, because we were separated most of our lives that I live with my sister who has a child and is a single mother. That's what they call them nowadays. As I live with my sister and I'm an actress I must be like a father figure. She lives in my shadow, it's a problem since I'm an actress and she's not. It's a problem that frightens a lot of people. But we have a wonderful relationship that I'm going to keep as long as possible. If we're separated, so be it. The fact that we're together needs no explanation. It's natural. We're better together than alone in our current circumstances. If we separate, so be it. But it's a problem for most people. All very Freudian and sick, a very unhealthy relationship. Women living alone. A lot of guys came to exploit the situation. Turning up when they like. A very good friend of mine was playing my sister in a play and it was constantly implied in the writing that we were rivals. That's how we were described. She was the trollop, the tramp. A sex-crazed siren. I was the 26-year old virgin who was totally frustrated. Always rolling around on the floor masturbating or having fits because she was so sexually frustrated. These plays are so misogynist, so one-dimensional and unimaginative. I don't think I ever have except in the TV series by Serge Moati "Le pain noir". It was a love story between two girls who could never get together. There was also a film by Marco Ferreri with Annie Girardot. Which was the opposite. It was about two women who hated each other over a man. It was the end of the world. And I end up killing Annie Girardot. I cut her up with an axe and feed her to my lover. It was really the opposite of what you're talking about. I have two girlfriends who also work in film: Francine Berger and Annie Duperey. We have a relationship that is absolutely wonderful. I hope that one day we'll be able to do something with that. We go out together. We're friends. We act like friends. And yet we end up with completely bizarre situations. Annie is a wonderful photographer. I take photos too, but not as well. The other day, the people at Minolta were so surprised that two actresses could get on so well that they lent us all the cameras we wanted. They thought it was so charming. We told them there was no reason why we should make life difficult for each other. Just because we're actresses? Just because, from time to time, whether it be with Francine or Annie we might be rivals? It was completely crazy! We are such good friends and we have such a great relationship! I don't think we've ever seen that in a film. It's definitely something that would have to be written by a woman from the inside. Do you have friends who are actresses? Yes, my best friend is a very talented actress. Yes. Have you ever had to play scenes showing friendship between women? No, I've never done that. Never! Never! No! What about antagonistic scenes? Yes, I've just done that. It was a spoof. It was a scene that we hated playing. But we did it. A friend of mine wrote it. A small budget film but it should do very well. I had to get really nasty with the other woman. It was difficult for both of us because women don't do that. When they do it's usually very charming, I feel. When women confront each other it's usually comical and charming. Unless you're at death point. It was difficult. At the screening, my best friend who's an actress said she didn't know how we did it. The lines were so difficult but we both came out like able. It was an unlikely scene between two women. - No, I don't think so. - Neither do. In "Rancho Deluxe”, a girl plays my sister. The way it was written, they hate each other. The horrible things that girl says. She hated me. She couldn't stand my guts. She didn't want to hear anything about me. She did everything she could to put me down. It was amazing. I don't have any sisters, I have a brother but I can't imagine sisters would be like that. Not like that. Have you played competitive scenes? Well, you have, with your sister as you said. Have you done any others? In the film I did in France there's a conflict between me and this woman's husband. The woman or her husband? The husband's wife. The conflict is because of the husband. His wife ends up becoming hysterical because I'm chasing him. To answer your question, I've never played a scene with another woman that showed friendship or compassion. - And you Jenny? - Me neither. Have your male partners had warm and compassionate scenes with other men? Love stories? - No. Friendship among men? Between men? Oh yes, men. Of course. In "Rancho Deluxe” the two men are best friends. That was the subject of the film. They go everywhere together, robbing cattle. They have an incredible relationship. Everything the other one does is always perfect. They're best friends and they have this ideal relationship. Whereas my sister and I had a terrible relationship. I can see what you're saying. Friendship between two women is never shown. They always seem much more alone. I have no idea why. Do you think it corresponds to reality? No, not at all. I have lots of women friends. The girl who played my sister is a really good friend of mine, before, during and after the shoot. It was amazing for her to have to say "Little creep, I'm going to kill you." I suppose it's traditional. Men work together, women don't. There's also women competing. About what? Just because they're women. About their attractiveness, their talent. Women are always depicted like wild cats. They're always compared to felines. I guess it's just another stereotype. I think it's more because you don't show friendship between two women. Many films are made about male friendship. About what they do together. But not much about what women do. We'd been filming for 2 weeks and I was beginning to realise that something was different in this film. All the scenes I'd filmed up to that point were with Jason Robards who was playing Dashiel Hammett. So I haven't played with Vanessa Redgrave yet. But there was something different. One day I realised it was the first time that I was making a film based on the relationship between two women. A relationship that was positive. Apart from "A Doll's House". You played in it. Where we had a relationship as friends, but it wasn't the focus of the film. Whereas in "Julia", the crux of the story was their love, their profound friendship. That changed everything. It meant that... it was also the first time. I was playing the role of a woman who wasn't playing a role. Usually in a film you have the relationship between men and women or women against women for the love of a man. That kind of thing. It's always about women who are playing roles, who want to be like this or like that, something that they really aren't. Or else, they're neurotic. Here, for the first time I was playing a character... I don't mean to say that the real Lillian Hellman wasn't neurotic. I have no idea. But the role I was playing in the film was that of an intelligent woman, an intellectual who was strong, who had a lot of rage. Which she liked. And her friend Julia liked it too. She keeps telling her to keep the rage because it makes her strong. Apart from that, she's also very stable. A woman who thinks, who's driven by ideas. She's herself. She's not playing a role. During the whole film even though I have problems with the film, I was so happy. It's so liberating to play that kind of character, in that kind of relationship. There was a scene, my first scene in fact with Vanessa. We were both 16. We were camping in the countryside. She was reading poetry and she was so beautiful and so moving. I was supposed to look at her and say, "Julia, I love you so much". There was no ambiguity about it. She wasn't a lesbian. Even though all close friendships man to man or woman to woman have some degree of physical attraction. Here, it wasn't a sexual relationship. But it was wonderful to say on screen "I love you" to a woman! "You give me such strength.” It was wonderful. It was the first time that we were playing women driven by ideas, not by romance. Not that they're not romantic. Listening to Vanessa tell me, she's a bit older than I am and was at university in England. She wanted me to understand the 1934 workers' movement in Vienna. There was a close up of Vanessa who was radiant. She was so alive with hope, with emotions about what it meant for a whole Viennese neighbourhood of men and women workers to rise up and create their own newspaper, which was Vienna's finest. They built a whole area of the city that was later bombed by the fascists. It's so rare. You forget that women can also be transported by ideas. That women can think, that they like to talk to each other. It was wonderful to be able to ask her, "What are you reading at the moment?" She tells me what she's reading. It's a very small scene. And I can see that everyone on the set is scared that I might touch her too much. In one scene I had to say good-bye to her. She was leaving by ship to attend university, for 2 to 3 years, in England. I'm very emotional saying good-bye to my friend, Julia. In the script, it said that we kissed each other. We then talk a little more and then we say good-bye. But I needed to kiss her again. The director refused. I knew it was because he was afraid that if I touched her too much, we would look like lesbians and he was very nervous about that. So he counted how often I touched her. Whenever I convinced him it was necessary to touch her in a scene the very next day in a scene with Jason the director had changed the script so that I lock at Jason in a more loving way, that was necessary. I would also have to touch him too. It was fine in the context. I thought it was funny. It shows that some of the men on the set those who had important positions were not at ease with the women's relationship. They wanted to remove things that were natural, and deprive us of our normal reactions between women. When we like each other, we walk hand in hand, we kiss each other and there's no ambiguity. As we're not used to seeing that on the screen the men needed to take it away from us. It also came up with the press. I did a lot of interviews on the film. I was with someone from the BBC. At the end of the interview, the guy said "So, you're doing a lesbian film you and Vanessa Redgrave?" I was amazed. I said it had nothing to do with it. It's so rare to see women's friendship depicted on screen that you have to look for a rationalisation. "I they love each other. It has to be sexual.” Things like that were grafted onto the story that had nothing to do with it, at all. I thought a lot about that. Why does it happen so often? It is often. The first article I saw in England from one of the reactionary papers was headed "Reds in Bed"! Because Vanessa and I were both militants and we were making a film together, that's how they headed the article. I was trying to understand why. In France, England, the US, our culture and social context is so alienating. - Alienating. - Alienating. Men are also victims of the stereotypes of what it means to be a man. You have to be strong and all that. So it's very easy to threaten their own identity. If a man is really sure of himself and knows what he is as a man there's no problem if women love each other, whether it's sexual or not. But there are few cases in our countries of men who feel good about themselves, who are sure of them. No, themselves. They feel threatened by women who are close, especially complex, intelligent and strong women. What do we know about Greek or Roman women? We only know what historians have written and all historians are men. All we have is a masculine point of view about women in history and that's the way we've been conditioned. Not to think about being a director. Our computer doesn't have that information. A lot about being a woman is therefore limited by the fact that everything we know has been written down by men. And it's that very being that has been limited and is trying to break out and re-program me itself. It's the most wonderful thing about being a human computer. We have a capacity that machines don't have that allows us to re-program me ourselves. It's not easy but it is possible to see your own mechanism at work. You can see how you're trapped and how it works and then change that. It's very difficult but it's something you learn to do in acting. You begin to see your instrument, as the tutors call it, at work and how it functions. You can begin to catch it functioning in ways that are not use able in the theatre of life or in the theatre-theatre. So you can start to change and develop it. Once you learn to do that on the stage you can start carrying it out in your life. As human beings of the female sex, we are now at this wonderful time of saying: "we're going to change our programming". It's the most wonderful time in the history of the planet to be a woman. I wouldn't like to be a man today. The vitality of this moment is passing to us. It's been with them for a long time and now it's passing to us. I hope that we can really grow in ways that we've been trained to grow. We have the gift for healing, caring, nurturing and now it's our planet itself that we have to take care of and nourish. I don't think it's going to be cared for by all the guys who have brought us to where we are today. Technology, man on the moon and maybe beyond our solar system. Right now, we have to save the planet so naturally, naturally it's time for women to come into their own. It's not just women it's the whole caring impulse, the principle that lives in all of us that wants to protect, it's time for that to come out. It's important for us as actresses to see that the changes in film are a reflection of what has to happen on the planet. Otherwise, there won't be a planet.
