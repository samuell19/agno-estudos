So, you can't even say it anymore? You don't need to answer, I see it in your eyes. I'm sorry... I don't know what you say. I'm so damn stupid. I shouldn't have asked. I should have never fucking asked! So, what do we do now? What the hell do you think we should do now? I love you. But, there's no more "We". I love you too. - Adrian. - Go away. - I just wanted to say that I'm... - Leave! I can't handle... I just wanted to say I'm... off to work now. Have a good... Well... I'll see you tonight, then we can talk some more. OK. I'm sorry. I don't know what to say. You don't have to say anything. I just think it all happened fucking fast. Have you been planning this for a long time, or what? It just happened that A.K. and Helena are moving in together. And A.K. doesn't want to sell her apartment right away. So she asked if I wanted to rent it, until... Until when? Until you've changed your mind and want to move back in with me. Like last time? No, it's not like last time. This time it's different. In what way? You always get depressed when summer's coming. Suddenly you want to break free, make changes, try new things. New apartment, new job, new boyfriend. Am I right? You know exactly what this is about. We can't go on like this anymore! It won't matter, it won't fucking matter if you want to come back to me again... because that's not ever gonna happen. You said it yourself. There's no more "We". Good. It's settled then. How nice that we finally agree on something, for once. How nice that you finally have an opinion, for once. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that. No, you're right. It's not easy to have an opinion about anything while constantly being criticized for how one thinks, acts, dresses, looks and smells. One finally gives up. - When are you moving? - This weekend. Saturday. Let me know if you need any help, packing, or... It's fine. I don't have that much stuff, and the apartment is yours so... And the girls offered to help out. I'll stay away then. I can work on some photos at the office, or ask Jack, or my sister to meet up for a coffee. Do that. Call Jack, or your sister. It could be... good for you to actually talk to someone. Really, another opinion of yours? Hi. I thought you'd be done by now... Ah, sorry, that's my fault. I thought Hampus said 6 p.m., but he really said at 16:00. I always mix it up, you know, in my head 17:00 is 7 p.m. She's such a flake. Six years at Chalmers University, but stuff like that just doesn't stick. But, it's also quite sexy. You need any help? No thanks, we're good. I think that's everything... Is Hampus up in the apartment? We're almost done here. - It's just, the bed... - The bed? But we bought it together. Yes, exactly. So, half is mine. But, as I recall, I was the one who ended up paying for all of of it. Remember? But, the new TV was a Christmas present from my dad... So we decided that settled it. Remember? But, the bed was way more expensive. Remember? Hampus. You need any help? Why don't you go down to see if anything else will fit in the car or the trailer? This is hard for me too, you know. You're not the only one who thinks this is... damn sad. If I can have half the bed, you can keep the TV. You use it more than I do. Hampus... Hampus! Hi... how are you? I'm OK... I almost didn't recognize you at first, you got a haircut... Were you just in the neighborhood or have you been waiting out here for me finish work? I was waiting for you. OK... Here you go. Some books of yours, and your old CD's I found while cleaning out the attic. And the photo album, you know, the one I made for you with photos from all our trips together. OK. Thanks, I guess. You didn't need to come over here, you could have just called and I would have come by the apartment. Well... you don't answer my texts. I just wasn't sure how to respond to your proposition. I don't think it would work. But unless we try, we can't know for sure... I guess I just came here to see if there is anything left. But I see now that everything is gone... You are gone. Maybe we can get together for a coffee some day? I'd be happy to meet up and talk, it's just that... Well, I don't think spending a whole weekend together in Copenhagen is such a good idea. Sure, I get it. It was a stupid idea. Have to get a few hours of sleep now, got the early shift tomorrow. But, let's stay in touch. Yeah, let's stay in touch. Fuck I've missed you. I've missed you too. You just disappeared. I moved in with someone. Is it over now? I'm here now. It was nice seeing you again. Yeah. I really needed this. Wanna stay for a bit? I really need to get home. Next time? Yeah, sure. You're the same. But, let's stay in touch. Good night. OK... Oh, and then there's this... Hey, that's yours. Well, you paid for both of ours. You know my mom chipped in so I could afford to pay for both. All the more reason for wanting it back. I also know she really wants you to keep it. We were happy then, right? Yes. It was one of the happiest nights of my life, when I actually popped the question, and you said yes. For me too. Hampus, what really happened? - Do you need to go through this again? - Again? We've hardly even talked about it... Everything just happened so fast. We should have married, or had kids like we used to talk about. Not just gotten engaged. Maybe we played it... too safe. Oh, OK, so if we had gotten married or had children, then you wouldn't have left me? - No. I didn't mean it like that. - So, what did you mean? I don't really see it like I was the one who left you, it was... ...more you who like... brought this on. I guess I just thought we were going through a rough patch. A rough patch that kept going on for months. I didn't want to live like that. I get that now. I'd be happy to keep it, as a memory, a beautiful memory. Good, that'll make mom happy. And me as well. So, what are we gonna do about Facebook, Instagram and stuff like that? - No idea. Fuck, I haven't had the energy to - Me neither. I mean, I haven't really told anyone yet, and we have so many friends in common so... I can't bear changing it, like publicly so everyone to see, if that's OK with you? So, it's actually happening... - Wait what, or what do you mean? - Well... I mean, it's just so definite when you change relationship status on Facebook... Hampus, I really need to close and go home. A.K. is waiting. Are you guys done? Hi, how are you? Not great... Really not great... What the fuck have I done? I've ruined everything... I saw you've updated Facebook, and it looked so fucking empty and sad. I miss you, so fucking much... I miss you too, like crazy. - Can I come over? - What? Can I come over to you, for one last time? "For one last time" sounds so awful. I don't know... is that really a good idea? No sorry. I get it, if you don't want me to. Stupid of me. Sorry. I do want to, but I just don't get you... Me neither, I don't know what's up with me, I keep leaving... I'm so fucking stupid. Don't say that. You have no idea how many times I've wanted to call you and ask you to come over. And why haven't you? You broke up with me. Guess I need to hold on to some sort of self respect. I was in such a dark place before. I feel a little better now. Good! Don't do anything crazy now! - You're the best! - No you are, don't you ever forget it. Thanks for putting up with me for such a long time. Stop it, it was you who had to put up with me. We put up with each other. We're both really such fuck-ups. Sleep tight now. Let's talk soon. - Good night. - Good night. Kisses. Good night. - OK. What about him? - Who? The blonde with glasses. For real? He's just a kid, and definitely not my type. I keep forgetting you're straight, but now it's really obvious. You're clueless. - OK, OK, shit. Give me another chance. - Yes. What about him? In the Grey t-shirt. Seriously? He could be my dad. - Though I guess he's kinda hot. - Exactly. You're not up for a hot nice sugar daddy? I'm not really interested in meeting anyone new yet. You don't have to meet a new boyfriend. Adrian, just have some fun. I don't think I'm ready for that either. Drop him! You said it yourself that you were sick of him, and that was way before he dumped you. Look at it this way, this was the best possible outcome, and you didn't even have to break it off. I've never said I was "sick of him". Oh really? Remember what you said last winter? I might have said that I wasn't as attracted to him anymore. And that sometimes the sex got a bit... boring. You know, sometimes I couldn't even get hard... Which is pretty normal considering we lived together for 3 years, we just hit a rough patch. It's the same fucking thing. - Only you were stupid enough to tell him. - I just wanted to be honest. Honesty doesn't always pay off, didn't you know? "I'm not that attracted to you anymore". How do you think that made him feel? No wonder he dumped you. I would have done the same, but right away. I cheated on him. What? I cheated on Hampus, the condom broke, and after that, well, I couldn't touch him anymore. I felt so fucking disgusting. What the fuck are you saying. When? And with whom? It's irrelevant, some lousy drunken one-night-stand. So fucking stupid of me. But yes, it happened, and then I didn't know what to do. I only knew I couldn't tell him. I don't know what to say. It's so... unlike you, to do something like that. Is it? Yes, maybe it is. I don't really know anymore. The only thing I do know is that I really regret it, and that I'm such a fucking coward. OK, don't turn around, but he just came in. Are you OK? It's cool. It's not as if we haven't seen each other or spoken since he moved out. You haven't told me that, either. No, maybe not. Anything else you haven't told me? Jesus, you're like a fucking clam, I have to drag everything out of you. Hi. - Hi Jack. - Hey. - How's it going? - Things are great. And you? I'm alright. Are you here with anyone? I was at a housewarming party at A.K. and Helena's... It was packed with boring couples so I left and came here, on my own. OK, cool. - Can I buy you another beer? - No, I'm good. Wanna check out my new apartment? What do you mean? I haven't had sex with anyone since we broke up. I'm so fucking horny. We already know each other, so isn't it a better idea that we fuck than just dragging home some random stranger? Adrian, don't over analyze this, it was just a suggestion... - I'm cumming... I'm cumming now... - Cum inside me! Cum inside me! On your back! Cum all over me! Cum all over me! Wow, that was... really hot. Yeah, that was fucking amazing. Why didn't we do stuff like that when we were a couple? Because you were such a prude and boring when it came to sex. Oh yeah? What the fuck are you saying? I was not. Actually you were. At first, before we got together, we did do stuff like this, remember? Yeah... But later, when we moved in together, it was all just lovey-dovey-sex and vanilla. Maybe you're right... Why didn't you say something? Why did you use a condom, by the way? What do you mean? Well, I told you I haven't had sex with anyone since we broke up. So, have you? - No... - Really? Why does it matter? We're not together. So I'm not really obligated to tell you if I did. Right? Wow, that was a sore spot. - I just didn't think you... - What? No, I just didn't think that you would have moved on so quickly. Seriously, what are you doing? Stop screwing me around. OK! Don't do this to me... again. Stop being so serious and boring all the time. Relax. I'm not gonna screw you around... I'm gonna screw you. All those years, you promised me you let me fuck you at some point. - Do you like it? - Yes. I knew you'd like it. No, no, fuck, stop! It's not gonna work. Well if you weren't such a control freak maybe I wouldn't have... What? You wouldn't have what? Broken up with me? This was a really bad idea. I can't believe I let you talk me into this. You know what? I was also thinking about breaking up... for quite a while... But I didn't have the courage, because I didn't want to hurt you. And I knew you wouldn't have been able to handle it. We can't go on no more. All that we had before. Has broken in two. You know I'm sorry. Wish I could undo. All the things I've put you through. Are we lost forever? Are we lost forever? Damn! That's it. Give me that sexy look! The hair. Nice! Perfect! Nice and relaxed. Thank you! Good work today. I'm insanely happy to be here. I'm so happy to be here. So am I. - Hey! Look at me now! Are filming? - Yes, camera action! - Are you watching? - Nice! - Any good? - Awesome! Very good! 10 out of 10. - I love you. - I love you too. It's you and me now. Forever. "We". Forever! There you go. Enjoy, guys. Thanks. It looks delicious. How is yours? - It's good. - Great. And yours? Really good actually. Actually? I mean it's always good, right? It's not like it's the first time we're here. We could have gone somewhere else, if you wanted to. This good. I mean, why try something different... How have you've been? You look really good, or I mean... you look like you're doing good. Sure, things are good. Busy at work. How about you? Well, I’m fine... I haven't really has as many creative assignments as I would have wanted, but... That's a bummer. Actually, I finally started writing new songs again. Wow! That's awesome... Damn, you're popular tonight. Well... I just wanted to say that I was very happy... and a bit surprised you said yes to meeting me tonight. Perhaps you had other plans? No, it's just... the girls, asking if I wanted to grab a drink later. Oh, OK. You absolutely should. Well, I really don't think I need your permission, do I? - Come on, that's not what I meant. - It kind of sounded that way. Was I that awful to live with? Oh stop it. We had a great... - Hey you... - Anyways... I just wanted to say I'm glad you wanted to meet up... And I wanted to apologize for last time. I want to make a toast. To us. I'll never meet someone as special as you. Come on, of course you will. Well I'm not sure I want to... meet someone new. - Hey... - Yes? There is something I would like to tell you... and I wanted to do it face to face, and not just call or text. Sure. I'm all ears. - I've met someone. - Met someone? What do you mean... You've met someone? I mean, we're sitting here right now. I've met someone new, a new guy. I went with David to the Canary Islands a couple of weeks ago and... What's the matter? Nothing, I'm good. I just didn't expect, you and David to, you two are... No, God no, not David. We were just there on vacation together. I met this guy from Switzerland who was also on vacation and we spent the last two days together. - And now, he's coming here. - Coming here? Yeah, I mean, next week. Great. Wow, I'm really happy for you. What a relief. I was freaking out about telling you. I knew you'd take it well though. Adrian, you're the sweetest guy in the world. Oh, stop it... Shit, I really need to get this. A.K. and Helena seem eager to party. Got for it. It's him. - Ah, OK, "The Swiss Cheese". - Hm, well... Hi! All good? Yeah, great. I could really use some more wine. Of course. Where did your friend go? Friend? Yes, the guy you're having dinner with. Oh him, well, no we're not not "friends". I see. What are you then? - Did you have a fight? - No, it's just, well, what are we really... Are you on a date? That's adorable. And it's not going too well? Listen, you guys just need some more wine, and I promise he'll go home with you. Hi, you've reached Hampus. Busy at the moment so just shoot me a sweet text instead. Later! Hey! Hey! Hampus! Hampus!! What are you doing?! - I want my bed back. - What are you talking about? I want my bed back! 'Cause it's mine. Haven't we already been over this? That was before... "The Swiss Cheese" came along. - What the fuck are you talking about? - I want the other half of the bed back! It makes me sick just thinking about the two of you... in our bed! - Give me a break! Are you drunk or what? - I'm not drunk. I want my bed back! Now! Adrian, please. You and I have to discuss this another day. We really need to get back to sleep. We. Who are "We"? What? He's already here? You told me... OK, I get it. Fuck you! You know that? You're a fucking liar! - Please. Adrian. Go home! - I want my bed back! Our bed! Our bed!! Fuck! Hello? Hi, having fun? How did the performance go? Or, what do you call it, the gig? No... I'm awake. Sure, I mean, we've been doing this for half a year so... I'd love to see you tonight. No, it's all good, I can come to you, it's pretty much around the corner. Well, you'll see. Yeah, I'm excited. I've been... looking forward to meeting you. I'm a bit nervous, actually. Well then, see you soon. Hi. I'm Rasmus. Hi Rasmus. I'm Adrian. I'm glad you still wanted to meet up. The dancers wanted to celebrate after the show and dragged me along. Sorry. It's all good. I just really felt it was about time, being in the same city and all... finally. So, do you wanna come in? Yes. Come on then. There is someone more than you. It is me and I can see. Here is a summer for us to heal again. I'm better off if we were more than friends. I know bad news spreading fast. Let the good ones win at least. For me and for us. Let's try again. Would you believe in us if I said to to you. I want you. Would you believe in us if I said to to you. I want you. Oh, oh, oh. I want you back to stay. Would you believe in us if I said to to you. I want you. Hey babe. Wait, what? The train is actually on time? I'm shocked. I'm already on my way to meet you at the station. No problem. Yes, I know you find your way around town now, but I want to. See you soon. Kisses. Bon appétit. Come, down here. OK... - Cheers. - Cheers. This is really good. - So, you like it? - Yes, I like it a lot. It looks really tasty. Was it OK? It's delicious. - Hi. - Hi. - Long time, no see. - Yeah, it sure was. Oh yeah, sorry. Julian. Julian, Adam. Hi, my name is Adrian, not Adam. But Hampus here often mix up the names. Right, so you've already forgotten my name. - Sorry, Adrian, of course. - No worries. Hi Adrian. I've heard a lot about you. Sometimes he calls me Adrian. You know, Julian, Adrian. Why are you speaking English by the way? - Oh, sorry, I thought... - Oh, sorry my bad, that's not "him". I really need to apologize about the last time we met, last year. I don't know what got into me. It was as if... It's fine. I was an asshole too. I'm sorry. I tried to get a hold of you, I called, texted, and... Yeah... It's a great honor to finally meet the famous screaming Adrian. You know, I would have done exactly the same. So... you're working out here again? Getting ready for Beach-20. - And you've met someone else, right? - I have, actually. I knew it. That's awesome, I'm happy for you. Tell me, is it anyone I know? I don't think so. He's a choreographer, Danish, lives in Copenhagen... It's a small world though. Awesome. So are you planning on moving over there? Or is he coming here? Oh wow, I have no idea really. We've only been dating for 5 months. Same as us. I need to go in and change, or I'll run the risk of changing my mind. - It was nice meeting you, Julian. - Likewise. You too, Hampus. Then that's over and done here. The coast is clear. A bit smoother this time. I remember you. You were here, was it, three, four years ago... And when you saw the tube with the blood you passed out. That's right, I thought you looked a bit familiar. I think I was a bit dizzy then. I see here you wanted these tests done because you have new partner. That's correct. - Congratulations! - Thanks. You've also stated that you always practice safe sex. Yup, safe, always. But, I just want to be completely sure before... - Well you know, new boyfriend and all. - Good. Well, we're all done here. I'll walk you out. I think you were the last one today. Oh hello, here's another one. Welcome. Well, well... We really need to stop meeting like this. - This is crazy. - Yeah. - Guess it's going well with your new guy. - With yours too it seems. Ready? OK, good luck now. Hope the tests come out negative so you guys can... I'm not really worried. Good luck to you too, so you guys also can... By the way, do you wanna come over to our place for dinner some evening? So we can meet... him? - Rasmus. - Yes. Yeah... sure. I need a shower. No, stay here and snuggle. Some sweat and sperm never killed anyone. I hope I didn't get pregnant now. Have you ever thought about how as a gay couple you can't have children of your own? What do you mean? Gay couples can easily have children nowadays. Adoption. Surrogacy... Sure, but it is not the same. Like how straight couples can have children. I mean, a child who carries both dad's genes, so they always will be connected and where they both can see each other in their child. I don't think I've ever really thought about it like that. I can't stop thinking about it, it's really fucking depressing. I can't wait for when scientists figure out how to merge two sperm cells... one from each man... and then but it in a female's egg, making it three parents. At least then the baby will carry the genes of both dads. Right now the closest you get is basically if we took your sperm and an egg from my sister... Do you want kids? Wow, I've never really thought about if to be honest. Never? Why not? I guess it hasn't come up... I haven't had that many long term relationships. Just not really my thing. OK... so you've never even lived together with a boyfriend? What are you getting at? Would you like us to move in together? You don't think it's a bit too soon? I mean, would I move here to Gothenburg, or you to Copenhagen? Living together isn't always the ultimate thing for every couple? No. It sure didn't work out for me the last time around. You've never really told me why you and Hampus broke up? Did he meet someone else? Did anyone cheat? You know, the regular stuff. It wasn't really that dramatic, the usual I guess, on day the love was just gone... For both of you, at the same time? That won't happen to us. We just have to make sure we don't end up like a tired, old boring couple. We'll spice up the sex once in awhile, enjoy a hot threesome. Or a foursome... Oh, I see... bored already? Babe, I was just kidding around. Don't take everything so seriously all the time. - You always take everything so seriously. - That's not true. Are you almost done? Rasmus! What the fuck? Chill out babe, what's the matter with you? At least I've showered. Just give me a minute. There. Done. You know, I was thinking, why don't you wear that shirt I got you for your birthday? But I really like this one. It's my favorite t-shirt. Sure, but you look so nice that other shirt... the same moment my taxi drove off, Adrian come walking up the street... We locked eyes, said "Hi"... And then I basically dragged him into my hotel room, and... Yes... Pretty much sounds how we met, also first through Grindr, right? - A toast to that! - Cheers! How did you two meet? Don't think you've ever told me that. Me neither actually. We'd been chatting for awhile and then Adrian suggested we'd meet up and, work out together. I was actually serious, so we met up and took a body combat class together and then Hampus pretty much invited himself over for dinner at my place the day after. And we ended up having a very nice evening, followed by a cozy night together, but then... Adrian had to rush off to some photo gig in LA, Venice Beach for a whole month, and just left me hanging. But Hampus couldn't wait, so after three weeks there was a knock on the door of my hotel room and completely unexpectedly, outside is Hampus. And it did the trick, cause when we got back home we ended up moving in together pretty much straight away. Wow! What a story. Sounds like the perfect rom-com. Sure does. Hard for us to beat that, huh. This food is incredible. Is everything from your restaurant? Yes. Did Hampus tell you that we are looking into having a baby? Wow, so soon? Together with A.K. and Helena? No, we have friends who've been through that and it always ends up with everyone arguing... And all of a sudden they're in the middle of a custody battle. - Just like all the straight couples then. - Yes, exactly. We're in contact with a surrogate mother and an egg donor through this organization in the US. Julian inherited quite a large sum of money from his grandma so... OK, wonderful. Anyway, A.K. and Helena have gotten their hands on some sperm from Denmark... And it seems like a success so... What's the matter. Are you OK? What? I'm so sorry. I'm thrilled for you, for both of you. I know how badly you want children. It was the first thing we talked about when we met... Do you guys also want to have kids? We haven't really discussed it. Everything's still so new. I don't even know if I want kids. It's not essential, but if it happens it happens... but of course it would be nice. But for us it doesn't just "happen"... We can't just go to the club and stick our dick in the first random guy we see. It takes a shitload of planning, a lot of fucking money, doctors, and... women! Do you remember the last time we were out and that baby hungry woman flirted with us and tried to take us home for a threesome to knock her up? Yes... How about this? One more drink here and then we go clubbing? - Yeah, sure. - Great. Thanks. Cheers to us. Cheers, to us. I'm so happy we can be friends now... that we all can hang out, the four of us, and it's not awkward. I love you, Hampus, and I always will. I love you too, and always will, you know that. But, well, it's me and Julian now. I know, and I'm super happy for you guys. - So, how are things with Rasmus? - It's good. I'm... I'm just terrified it will end the same way... That I'm going to repeat the shitty thing I did to you. So I was right then. It wasn't just all in my head. Was it just once? Or with several? Hampus, I'm so sorry. I am! It's in the past now. I just needed to know. You know, Julian loves me just the way I am. And so did I, I... just had a really bad way of showing it. Come on, are we having a pre-party, or are you guys just gonna stand out here all lovey-dovey and talk good old memories all night long? I wanna dance! Come on! Thanks for the dinner by the way, it was really awesome. I totally get why your restaurant is a success. Adrian, I'm not blind, I get it. What is it you "get"? It's alright, Hampus is over you, he's moved on. You really should too. Take good care of Rasmus, he seems like a really good guy. I mean, if he is the one you love? Also, we can use great babysitters later on. Perfect. Doing alright there? - Let's put it down here. - Yes. - Are you sure about this? - Yes. It feels right. And the TV? Don't worry about it. We don't need another one. Don't give me that sad face. We're only moving to Malm. You're welcome to visit whenever you want... You know that, right? I know. I need to get going... Julian is getting impatient down there. - Take care now, Adrian. - You too, Hampus. You should get going. You've got someone waiting for you.
