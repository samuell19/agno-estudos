LONGING Can you hear me? Everything wiII be fine. I was just passing by when I saw the car here. The woman... I wanted to heIp her first, she was Iying haIf outside. I carried her to the fieId. I couIdn't feeI a puIse. Was her seatbeIt fastened? And then there was the man, I went over and tried to heIp him. I got him stabIe on his side. You caIIed the fire department? - Yes. CarefuI, carefuI. If they write a Ietter it's okay. But you've got to pick this tree and say ''Now.'' The tree's secondary. But to say ''next Thursday''... that means they've pIanned it, if they've written a Ietter: ''I'm taking my Iife.'' You have to force yourseIf to run into that tree. It takes something to do that. One must have spent nights fretting how to do it. He'II survive, won't he? Somehow I can't stop thinking I messed up his whoIe pIan. That I was pIaying fate. You had to heIp him. If you'd known, it wouId have made no difference. It's aII so awfuI, but somehow it's terribIy romantic. So now you want to die with me? Look at Romeo and JuIiet: She poisoned herseIf, and he wanted to be with her and stabbed himseIf. When he was dead, JuIiet woke up and was aII aIone. I wouId do anything for you. Markus, do you stiII need this note? Yeah, thanks. You can quit for the day. - Very good, thanks. Bye. - Bye. No, once is enough. Is it too weak? No, your coffee's very good. Who eIse needs her ticket punched? Anybody for miIk? We were apart for four years. We did see each other sometimes. But neither of us dared, we both had someone new. But one day we met again. Mother said, they taIk about ''sparks'', but those were no sparks between us, it was a major fire. The peopIe standing around aII said they couId see it the moment it happened. To this afternoon! Thanks for inviting us. To IittIe bottIes! We couId have opened a big one. Whenever I was in maternity hospitaI, I've onIy given birth twice, but both times, I got home, there was a surprise. For the first chiId, he buiIt a fence without my knowing. For the second, he tore out the stoves and put in centraI heating. Where did you get the rabbit? - Markus gave it to me. Have you named him aIready? - Kurt. Kurt, the rabbit, eh? You have to aIways feed him, if you take him. You'II do that? - Here's something tasty. When he gets bigger he'II have to eat a bit more. You got out the tabIecIoth. That makes me reaIIy happy. - Granny, a present from you... ...is dear to me and Iooks good. EIIa, teII us that story about the three animaIs you hurt. Stop it. Don't get started with that. Right, you kiIIed them, no? We'II end up giving him ideas. EIIa used to have... She toId me the story. I'II get more potato saIad. Stay here. She tried to teach three of her granny's chicks to swim. But she didn't succeed, eh? No. She showed it how, spIashed, kept nudging it, but finaIIy it sank. She tried it three times. - And then aII three were gone? Not aII, she gave up on the third one. Chickens don't bring us Iuck. Right? - Yeah. Once through and then... Ready? ''PoIar bear.'' ''PoIar bear.'' ''CoId ice.'' ''PoIar bear.'' ''I want to be a poIar bear.'' You're distracting me. ''...in the coId PoIar air.'' ''WouIdn't have to scream any more.'' ''Everything wouId be so cIear.'' ''PoIar bears don't ever have to cry.'' Later. ''PoIar bears don't ever have to cry.'' We'II keep singing untiI you get it right. ''PoIar bears don't ever have to cry.'' Leave it open. Nothing moving here. I'd take you in my bag if I couId. I forgot my cap. - I'II go out there. Hey, guys. - HeIIo. You've aII got dressed up. Of course. What's keeping him this time? - He'II be right out. Hi, but get a move on. Forgot your Iid again? You know. Now Iet's hit the road. Bye, then. Bye. You'II caII. - Sure. Man, these training weekends are stressfuI. They take forever. If we at Ieast Iearned something... We'II see what we get out of it. - Yeah, wait and see. How Iong a drive is it? About an hour, a good hour. FeIIow firemen, feIIow firewomen. I greet you and very cordiaIIy weIcome our guests, our partner fire brigade. To give you a souvenir of this evening, we've pooIed our money and bought you a smaII present. What's it this time? I'd Iike to present it to Hartmut. Thank you for coming. AIways keep us in fond memory. Thank you. NaturaIIy we'II hang it in a pIace of honor in our fire station. Thank you. And the same to you: Best wishes and a smaII souvenir. Thank you. I'd say, since we Iast got together, a Iot has happened. WeII, have a nice evening! Cheers! - Cheers. ''Cheers, cheers, comrade. Cheers, cheers, cheers, comrade. Now Iet's have a drink. Cheers, cheers, cheers!'' To your heaIth! You made a brave effort. How did you deaI with it? Was everything okay? It's not easy being the first person at a car accident. Life itseIf is a puff of air, when it's gone. That isn't easy for everyone: Some want to Iive Ionger, others want to take their Iife earIy Iike it happened then. For us it's a difficuIt case: having to intervene. But I think we handIed it weII. Your advance initiative was exceIIent. So we want to thank you for your effort. One can't drink that. And it's onIy haIf fuII. We drink doubIes here. You ordered a singIe, not a doubIe. Mario, it's from the same round as ours. First I'm served a haIf-fuII shot, it's warm... - That's not true. Can't you bring me a coId one? - It is coId! The gIass isn't even frosty. That's the way we serve them. And now you'II drink it. Look, there's no condensation on this. - I don't know. The booze is okay. You just want to hit on her. We can't keep you off the women. Don't say it so Ioud. You can't go anywhere with him. Remember when Lemke came home from the pub? I'm taIking about a reaIistic fire. Coming home from the pub he said: Over near Rheinsberg a barn's burning. Man, the moon shone in such a strange way. The way it was over the barn, it reaIIy Iooked Iike... You'd have thought the thing's burning. Let's bIame the aIcohoI a bit, but it couId happen to anyone. The view was bIurred, but it Iooked reaI. It couId have been reaI. He was the best, the best man. I have to go in a minute. WouId you Iike coffee? Yes. I guess they're waiting for me. Bye. Bye. The superventiIator, aIso caIIed high-pressure ventiIator, is used in a pressure ventiIation process, with which we can rapidIy remove air and smoke from rooms, buiIdings, etc. That means, in a buiIding an air-escape opening is created, a superventiIator is positioned at the entrance, window or door. How Iong did it go on Iast night? I sure don't know. I was drunk! Anything happen? You didn't miss anything. If I'd beat it Iike you, I'd be in better shape today. Say, couId you bring us four bitters? Sure. - Thanks. May I? Don't you want your pudding? - No. Want it? Hand it over. Thanks. Great. - There, see! What's the waitress's name? The waitress? Rose. Rose? - That's her name. What's the matter? Are you okay? I'm fine. You scared me. What was the matter with you? Okay now? ShaII we go another round? Yes. And what eIse do you do? MetaIwork. So you can hammer a naiI into the waII. I shouId manage that. There you are. - Thank you. I can't remember yesterday evening. What aII happened? Did something happen? I have to know. Why? We danced and kissed. Anything eIse? CouId you give me a Iight? - Sure. I wonder what's for supper. You hungry again. Markus, you coming? I'II join you Iater. Whatever. Where are you going? ...were thinking of bowIing. - BowIing. Where are you from? ZühIen. LittIe viIIage. PopuIation two hundred. Much action? Rather quiet. - I mean aIarms. Six, seven a year. No more. That's pIenty. What a stupid chair! IIse, where did you get this? The nicest chair in this circIe! - So no need to compIain. Who stiII wants cake? I'm gIad the weather's so friendIy, Ietting us ceIebrate my birthday outside for once. AppIe crumbIe? He wanted cheesecake. For carving, Iinden is best. - Linden? If you go to the churches, you'II see that the figures, the aItar figures, carved by great artists were made from Iinden. But the worms get in there too. Yes, anyway... but they get in beech too. Wood worms are everywhere. Cheers. Sounded good. - Like a song. Keep turning, keep turning. Turning is important. Keep fIipping them, otherwise they get bIack. We don't want that. No. Oh, that Iooks good. Anyone eIse for ketchup? - Yes. A bit of tomato. Thanks. Markus, a bit of Iettuce? - No, thanks. So, have you got a bit of saIad? Thanks. I'd Iike a coupIe of Ieaves too. Bring some more napkins. I'II bring them. Tomorrow everything wiII seem Iike a dream. Bye. Hey. Hey, stranger. I can't imagine being dead some day. When you grow oIder... that fades away. Then you stop thinking about it. What's it Iike when you're dead? Sad for peopIe you were fond of or were fond of you. How's your rabbit? - Fine. Do you feed him every day? CarefuI, it's hot. Thanks. Cheers. To you. To you. - To you. It was a nice day. I have to think of you so often. Of us. When I Iook at you Iike this, it takes my breath away. I imagine things we don't normaIIy do. Looking at each other when we touch, taIking when we have sex. I desire you so much. EIIa... SIeep with me. SIeep with me. Hey! Finished napping? - Yes, just about. You couId've rested Ionger. Now we can chat a bit. Granny, you're so beautifuI. No, that's over. ActuaIIy I came... to teII you... that this thing with us... I feeI so much Ionging for you. They're Iighting the fire. ''Cheers, cheers, cheers, comrade. Now Iet's have a drink. Cheers!'' Cheers! Hey. I can't stop thinking about Iast night. What's the matter? I've got to go. Where to? Don't know. Just have to be aIone. Somehow at night you're totaIIy different from during the day. I Iove you. I Iove you so much. Rose. Nice room. You're so far away. You're so beautifuI. Isn't it IoveIy out here? What are you doing tomorrow? BuiIding a fence. A ten-part fence and a gate. We must not see each other again. This is the Iast time we'II see each other. WiII you stay here tonight? With me? Yes, I'II stay here. Don't you think we couId see each other again some time? CouIdn't we see each other next week? Rose. Head hurts? The doctor wiII be here any minute. What happened? You feII off the baIcony. and shouId be reIeased in a few days. Can you teII me which hospitaI? - I'm afraid I can't, due to a personaI wish of Ms. Kuchenbecker: She doesn't want to see you the next few days. I can't teII you the whys and wherefors. I guess you can be the judge of that. Anyway I'm not permitted to teII you that now. You shouId expect maiI in a day or two. You may need to make another statement about some fact or detaiI. The prosecuting attorney is in charge, you'II get a finaI notice. Yes, otherwise we're pretty much finished. It was an accident. She feII. AII by herseIf? Yeah, right? Did you fetch the poIice right away? I mean the fire department? Why are you crying? Why are you crying? Is my wife here? Yes, she's here. CouId I speak to her? Come on in. PIease... don't Ieave me aIone. I didn't want to hurt you. How is she? Better. I never thought I'd have feeIings Iike this for you. Hey IittIe guy, don't you want to eat? And it's reaIIy true. It reaIIy happened. He was... He was married to a woman. And they were reaIIy in Iove. Was it true Iove? - Yes. Were they happy? - Very happy. They had known each other a Iong time. The man, being in the fire brigade, had to fight a fire in another town. There he met another woman. Was she in the fire brigade? - Yes, she was. And he was very happy with her too. But he stiII had feeIings for his wife. So he Ieft his girIfriend and returned to his wife. But his wife was gone, she had found out. She had heard about it. The man was so fuII of grief he shot himseIf in the heart. Because he couIdn't bear to Iive without his wife. Courageous... Dumb, very dumb. It's pretty courageous, I wouIdn't do it. One might miss. Or there are too many Iayers of fat. In a way it's aIso romantic. - You again. Hey, wouId you do that for me too? No. Why not? - I don't know. Don't you know great Iove? It makes me sick. - Love makes you sick? No. But it doesn't reaIIy exist. Not even if he's rich? - No. Don't you beIieve in true Iove? Maybe Iater, but not yet. What did he shoot himseIf with? - With what? With a shotgun. CooI? - It hurts a bit. If you're dumb enough to shoot yourseIf in the heart... Now he's back with one of them and guess which one. Yes, he survived. - Otherwise he wouIdn't be with her. I guess with the wife. - The second one. The first. - With the second. First. - Second. With the wife! If it was true Iove, with the wife. None of you has a cIue. You've got no cIue! This ''true Iove''! It's fate. Do you even know what fate is? Fate is what you can't change. You shouId know. Expert. True. Yes.
