You ready? Oh. Not going. Not dressing up like an adult. Yeah, but we're game-day players. Come on. Let's go. Okay. I put on the clothes, and I feel better for a second like I'm somebody with someplace to go but then I think I'm a complete fraud and they'll see right through me. A fine fantasy object, but useful, too... shitting, sitting, insulation in the winter months. Sam... Not an easy job market but you're the most sought-after graduates in history. Know your value. Sell to the highest bidder. Now, we know your... ...market share of existing markets. Nothing else matters. You can talk about your art history your Derrida, your la-dee-dah, your poetry but in reality, the moment you step outside the magic circle drawn around this institution you are at the mercy of market forces and nowhere will prepare you more thoroughly to harness those forces for your own benefit than McKinsey and Company Consulting. Remember, follow the bouncing ball to McKinsey. You got to get over to I-banking. You won't buy workout clothes for ten years. Somehow I don't see you working in a bank. Thanks. I calculated the odds of getting hired by McKinsey. From Stanford or here, it's about 500 to one. From anywhere else, forget about it. Why do you tell me these things? So... how you doing? I'm fine. That could be the most dangerous lie you tell today. Come on, Bill. I've been back for ten minutes. Just put me to work. I'll be okay. I've got a Missing Persons. Male, Caucasian, 24 years. Name: Embry Larkin. So, when'd this kid go missing? Uh... two years ago, from the university. Rich kid. Dropped out. No family. Some um, lawyer... a trustee... says he hasn't touched his accounts. Now tell me he was on drugs and depressed. Well, there is a drug thing, yeah. Come on, Bill. He drove up north with a couple of rocks in his pocket. He jumped in a lake. Hey, we're not looking to hit any home runs here, okay? The kid had money. It's going to get investigated and you're the right guy today. You going to give me a cruiser? "Boa. B-O-A" My mother's been to a snake church. Did you say, "snake church"? Yeah, snake church. Okay. "Persian religious teacher" Nine letters. Zoroaster. Great. Good and evil. "My book is Genius"... "Genius" capitalized. He's a physicist. I should know this. He had weird hair. "Feynman. F-E.." I can spell "Feynman" "F-U-C. Feynman" I'm sorry. My McKinsey interview is in 30 minutes. Personally, I'm not a dog that salivates every time some I-banker consultant rings his little bell. Hey, um, Katie, um I love being friends in quotation marks. It makes me so horny. Knock it off. We are friends. Hey, Katie. Amanda. Sam. August. So, um, we were just talking about friendship and how... How we'll all be selling out. Sooner or later. Some of us sooner than others. I don't know, you guys. I think it's just really about doing what makes you happy. He's right. Harrison, you're just so... hopeful. Oh, thanks. Sorry to keep you waiting. I already spoke with two officers. I'm not sure what else I can tell you. Right, right. Well, those other two detectives are no longer on this case. I am. So, what makes you think Embry Larkin is dead? Purely account activity. We haven't heard from him in a couple of years. He hasn't used any credit facilities. But this kid was all over the map. I mean, how do we know he's not sitting on some island smoking Thai stick, wearing a sheet? He also had two first-class airline tickets to Athens, Greece, that he never used. It takes seven years for a missing person to be declared dead. Now's as good a time as any to get the ball rolling. Right. Well, who gets the money? The Larkin Foundation. All of it? All of it. Look, his family was a client of the original partners. I don't know this kid at all. Katie! Hi, Katie Burke. There is a message for you. Your thesis advisor, Professor Jergensen's office they said I should find you, so I did. Here's the message. It says for you to come to Jergensen's house. That's scary. How's your thesis coming, anyway? It's almost done. How's yours? Turned it in. Ms. Burke, I'd like to have you meet Wade Handler. He's a police officer. Hello. Hi. Mr. Handler has a line of inquiries... That's "Detective" Professor. "Doctor" Detective. Detective Handler has a line of inquiry that he's forcing upon the college. Force? Oh, no, we don't use force... not in the People's Republic... we ask politely because the college is good for the tax base which is good for the community which is good for everybody. So, um, Katherine Burke... Katie. Katie... I'm investigating a young man who was a student here, Embry Larkin. Something happen to him? Well, that's what I'm trying to find out. What was your relationship? He was my boyfriend. Detective, this college is very proactive about the privacy of its students. Oh, I understand, Doctor. I'll be gentle. So... he was your boyfriend? He disappeared. He left school. He disappeared, or he left school? Which? Both, I think. I... haven't heard from him. Not once? Not even once. Do you have any idea where he might be? No. That's fine. Thank you for your time. Here's my card. If you think of anything else just give me a call, all right? How's your thesis coming? I'm learning so much. You have a draft for me? Close, really close. Let's preserve our older dorms. Go home, leave it alone. Let's preserve our older dorms. Go home, leave it alone. Let's preserve our older dorms... How'd it go? I completely blew it. There's tea and stale pastries. Don't, whatever you do, take one. I got crumbs all over my cashmere sweater. I won't be wearing a cashmere sweater. So, I don't think that'll be a problem. Ooh, working-class hero, good strategy. They hated me. I could tell. They want Vietnamese orphans... and engineers. God, why wasn't I born a Vietnamese orphan? This is so familiar... "I blew it. I'm a loser" and then, "Oh, look, I got an A" No. I lost my concentration. I wasn't supposed to concentrate. It was supposed to be effortless. And then, I started concentrating and becoming earnest and then I started seeing them as seeing me as seeing myself as the type of person who wants to appear earnest which is completely wro... Do you hear what's going on up here? I hate wearing these itchy things. How do I look? How do you think you look? Headline: "Composer of Questionable Talent... ...excoriates Audience for Enjoying His Music... ...in a bizarre exercise in self-loathing" "Senior Embry Larkin... ...winner of the Leonard Bernstein Award for Original Composition... ...stood up before his latest theatrical production... ...Trip-Hop Inferno,... ...and lacerated the audience... for their attendance" He flipped off 200 people and disappeared three weeks before graduation. He was already Summa Cum Laude and he says, "Screw you and your degree" It was exceedingly theatrical and standard Embry. What was standard about it? Dropped out twice... once to work on some archeological dig in Cambodia... once to work in a factory. I expect him to pop up running La Scala or the Berlin Opera. What a guy. 800 math SATs. 3.94 GPA. Thesis? "Emerging Ancillary Markets in the Global Wireless Revolution" I bet that's quite a read. We're actually looking to beef up our Tech Practice but then you probably already knew that. So... "Katherine Burke" who are you? Where do you come from? I grew up in the middle of nowhere. The birthplace of Wendell Willkie is 20 miles away, and that's about it. My mom works in a bottling plant and sells Nutra-Life products and my dad left when I was little. I never really knew him. Hmm. Tell us about a problem you've encountered. My guidance counselor tried to keep me from applying to good schools. I thought she was my friend. She said she understood me and that I would be happier staying close to home... junior college or secretarial school. She hated me. What action did you take? I invited a senator who attended college here to speak at our school. And what was the result? I got a strong letter of recommendation from a U.S. Senator, was accepted early decision and they gave me lots of financial aid. And what did you learn from this experience? Truthfully? Of course. Mrs. Castleman was a sneaky bitch. It was the first time I was betrayed by someone I trusted. I looked up to her. I didn't come close to understanding the depth to which she resented me. I learned that people who help me, who invest in me become my partners, and my success is their success that relationships are symbiotic. I learned responsibility based on others' faith in me. I hope to be able to pay some dividends to those investors. How many pennies do you think it would take to fill this room? With or without us in it? Whoa, whoa, stop! Okay, that was... appalling. Sopranos, this piece was written by monks who believed in God. They're singing not to other monks but to God. They're singing about God to God. And you think I'm a tough audience. Okay, I'd like to hear you, you, and... you. Step down here. From the beginning. And... You and you. And... You. Again. Sing. This is the spirit dissolving in the music carrying up to God... Open up and let her rip. Don't perform... create. Say, "Muse, I hate you, but I hate you on my knees" Scream, "I am the infantile center of the goddamn universe!" Everyone! I am the infantile center of the goddamn universe! Now everyone! Are you listening to this? Water polo or lacrosse? Lacrosse. Word is, you slaughtered it. I talked to Brian whose brother dates that cold fish, Susan. Did you really call some lady a bitch? Slight exaggeration. Yeah, they saw 60 people and liked exactly two... you and a North Korean girl who speaks eight languages. They said that? Ms. Burke? You sure work hard. Listen, do you have time for a cup of coffee? No, I really don't. Steam heat. The best kind. Doesn't dry you out up here. You're not a big one for small talk, are you? I mean, I get it, believe me. A person can really piss their life away talking to idiots. Do you think it's possible this kid, Embry might have killed himself? Nobody with Embry's self-regard would kill himself. Nobody. He would have himself bronzed first. In fact... if you see a statue of him somewhere check and see if there's a person inside. He hurt you that badly, huh? It's none of your business. Well, actually, it's my job, so it is my business. You know, I'd love to just pal around and talk about the past... really, I would... but I'm actually trying to move on with my life right now. Right. I'll see you around. We need to be quiet... ...in the library! Quiet! Studying... Ah, 10:30 on a Friday night. I wonder where Katie is? I thought you were entertaining the lacrosse team. I was being entertained by the lacrosse team. The global wireless revolution will be safe until tomorrow. And the day after. We're leaving. Want a blender drink? No, blender drinks suck. Oh, look, it's a Siberian bear. Who paid for all this? What? Who paid for all of this? His dad was just appointed Governor of Uttar Pradesh. Evening, Mr. Bond. To Russia. What? To Russia. Yeah. Match you. Again. Again. Again. Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Right now... everything is so perfect. I feel so connected. Why don't we feel this way all the time? Maybe I'll always wear a hat. Hat guy. The guy who wears the hat. Are you all right? No. Look, Katie... um... a cop stopped by my room. He left a note. He said he wanted to ask questions about Embry. He probably talked to you first and, uh, you know I was just hoping it didn't upset you. Harrison, my entire body feels like rusting metal. And I'm seeing things. I think I might have a chemical depression. Come on. You are not one of those people. What people? The problem people. You know, "Hey, look, have you seen my new problem? "Hey, guess what? I got a shiny new problem" You're not like that. You're amazing. No, I'm not. Okay, um, you know what? This is what we should do first. Let's get out of here. There is a huge anti-globalization rally. We could camp out. We could get arrested. Just stand for something. I'd like to go to sleep now... and when I wake up, I'll stand for something. Katie, it's not a joke. Yes, it is! Harrison, it's a huge joke. Anti-globalization? You might as well stop oxygen or the sun coming up. You know what? You're really tired. Um... yeah. You're-You're very tired and I am, uh... I'm going to go. Um... you know if you think about it, please try not to forget our plans this weekend. Okay? Let's talk about you... about your yodeling. Level with me. You've never sung anything before, have you? I've sung... in the shower, walking, sort of under my breath. Burt Bacharach. Johnny Mathis. I wanted to meet you. Hey... Uh-uh-uh... You're a virgin. Nobody this organized ever had time for sex. Okay, Katie from Rushville if you have a voice, you sing. Nobody ever said, "If you had a voice, take finance" What now? Whoa. Is this a bad time, or...? No. I-I'm sorry. I thought you were somebody else. That's good for me, not for them. So, we're having a little event at an NBA game kind of a meet-and-greet. It's fun, you know, if you're into pretending you're not under a microscope. Do you like basketball, or...? I don't know. Oh. Uh... Sure. Um, I'll come. I... Thank you. It's exciting. Uh, that's... for you. See you. Inability or helplessness can have serious psychological ramifications. Powerless people become either hostile or passive. Neither is desirable. We need to feel that we are heard and that justice has been attempted when we feel we are unfairly treated. Negotiation for resolution of disputes when your actions prevent another from achieving their goal... is apparently a conflict of interest... If we were to define goals... Where is this? It's not a theater. Embry was interested in non-traditional space. This is under the theater. My final production... Middlebrow For Lowbrows... "but look "we're under the stage, like hell, itself. Isn't that brilliant?" It's derivative. You people are derivative. You haven't produced a real artist in over a decade and I would rather be dead than mediocre. So, one last announcement before the show: Screw this play screw this place and screw you people. And then he vanished, like a magic trick. Where do you think he went? Word is, he had a car waiting. Probably went to the airport. I guess I haven't been feeling like myself lately... whatever that means. I mean, I don't... I don't know what "myself" feels like. It's subjective and changes all the time. Have you been feeling uneasy? I'm having trouble finishing my thesis. Uh... I'm having trouble sleeping and when I do sleep, I'm having these weird dreams. Huh. You're exhausted, yeah? Emotionally mentally and physically? Okay. This should help you with the anxiety, all right? And I'd like to schedule a regular time for us... at least until exams are over. Okay? I just keep thinking that the finish line is right there and if I can just get across it then everything will be okay. We'll get you across. So, I'm going to see him now, I guess, on a regular basis. You just want to do him. I know you. You know you. He is cute. Mm, sort of. He's not my type. Smart, sensitive, wants only to talk about you... how is that not your type? Sam, I can't read, I can't sleep... And I'm sure Dr. Dave will be able to give you what you need. I'm serious. Okay, okay, um, did he sit behind his desk or did he pull his chair close to you? Close to me. Did he... lean over like this? Did he look into your eyes like this? You're going to do him. Sam... Come on, how long has it been, sophomore year? What if it's rusty... or broken? I still feel like I'm betraying him. Embry? Please. What if Embry comes back? He'd... wreck your life just like before. Listen, I want to tell you something. Um, I believe your friend, Embry, is dead. He had two airline tickets for Athens, Greece. Never used. No credit activity. He didn't... he didn't believe in credit. No cash withdrawals. No ATM. Was that other ticket for you? Were you going to Athens? Originally, but we were both having second thoughts. Well, I saw the beginning of that show... his speech to the audience. Look, that was just Embry being Embry. He was going for shock value. He was leaving; I was a sophomore. I mean, I thought that he would call from Europe and maybe I would meet up with him in the summer. I never heard from him. You have unusually kind eyes. See you around, Detective. I'm Wade Handler. I'm a cop. Uh, you don't have to share if you don't want to. I don't even know what to say. Uh... I'd find tollbooth tickets and credit card receipts for bars in towns I didn't think I'd been to. One day I went out to my car and there's a dent in the front. I look closer. There's blood and some brown hair. I still don't know what happened. Maybe it was a cat. There was an incident two years ago involving an undergraduate student and illegal drugs. Right. What do you want to know about Embry Larkin? Well, he got himself arrested. I want to know what he was selling. Was it heroin? Heroin? Embry? Are you kidding? I'm not kidding. No, no, he wasn't into that shit. They put him on Ritalin when he was three... you know, your standard A.D.D. misdiagnosis. Okay, um... Basically, he was taking Wellbutrin which is sort of like having a perfect cup of coffee. You know, it was great for work, great for repetitive tasks. Add in some Paxil which is anti-depression, anti-anxiety... you know, that general sense of well-being. Was he selling it? Look, Embry's dad was rich and Embry's mom was rich and they died when he was three or four, making him doubly rich, so... no. So, what'd it do? Made him normal, you know, when he took it. Katie... I heard my name whispered... "Katie. Katie" There was somebody on the other side of the row of books. I think it was my old boyfriend. I think he's back. I'm almost certain I saw him in his car. I think he's been watching me. And how does that make you feel? Nervous... elated... scared. I want to see him, but... but scared that I want to see him. Why do you say scared? Because I lost a part of myself with him. I just dissolved. He was like a drug. And he was locked inside the library with you? I think so, yes. But you hadn't seen him in two years? I know how this sounds. Katie, you fell asleep in an old library which is terrifying under the best of circumstances. You're facing your graduation, the completion of your thesis job interviews... life-changing transitions. You need to make allowances for the emotions that this will bring up. Yeah? He convinced her she could be an artist. They were going to live in a houseboat in Amsterdam... a sailboat off the coast of Sardinia. He'd compose, she'd sing and tell him he was a genius. Please, I'll have a double order of escape fantasy and a side of running away. He was losing interest? I saw it coming. He'd replaced her in his show. That bastard hurt her. You know, she hasn't dated anyone in two years. Was he a jealous guy? He didn't like her friends particularly the guy friends... particularly, one friend... this guy, Harrison Hobart. He felt threatened by me. Katie and I are close, and one day he was being a bit of a bully psychologically and I said something. He turned on me. He just started poking me in the chest with his... with his finger until, finally, I stopped backing up. You know, I didn't realize he had a bottle in his hand. He put you in the hospital. Yeah, well, it was only overnight. Why didn't you press charges? If you had pressed charges Katie might've held it against you? Yeah, probably. You see Embry didn't want to admit it but Katie and I had much more in common than the two of them did... and he apologized, so... What is your relationship with Katie? Oh, man, I wish I knew. You dating her? I don't know. Well, sort of. Well, either you are or you're not... right? Is this about Embry or is this about Katie? I remember my dad leaving. Almost my first memory. He said, "I love you. You can't come with me" My mom turned the heat down to 55 to save money. I just remember this... feeling of... emptiness... always being cold. Sam... Hey. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. Oh, well... big night. I saw Embry. I think he's back and I think he's watching me. Where did you see him? I saw him outside of class. I saw him get into his car. You want to... you want to sit down? You're kind of making me nervous. Are you afraid of him? Is that why you're here? I'm just afraid. Okay. I'll look into it. Thanks. You know, I'm not really doing anything. You're welcome to hang out if you want. Okay. So... why did you become a cop? Oh, I don't know. I, um... I had some issues. I was screwing up. My uncle had a badge and he cut me a break. What kind of issues? Extreme... extreme substance abuse. Being a cop help? Oh, no. Uh-uh. What do you mean? Well, I got a pocketful of Get-Out-Of-Jail-Free cards and I never changed anything. Then I used up all the cards. Setting the foundation. Recreational logging. Squirrel. Who took all these? Self-timer. Ex-fianc?e. She got tired of The Handler Show. Yeah, when things start going too good I can't help myself, I got to mess 'em up. It's my M.O., anyway. Finished product. Excuse me. Can you take me home now, please? Katie? You scared me. Harrison, I'm... I completely forgot. I'm sorry. You lied. You lied to me. I'm a... I'm a total idiot. I'm just... I'm completely deluding myself! No, you're not an idiot! You're not an idiot. Katie, I got to tell you something and I should've told you a long time ago. I think... you're kind... beautiful... and talented and I... I love you. What? Uh... I'm in love with you. I think I've always been in love with you. Harrison... But, you know, you don't have to say anything. You're great... and... you're kind and organized and one of the smartest people I know and anyone would be so lucky to be with you. Harrison... I go away for a while and look what happens. You let the whole place fall apart. The police are looking for you. I don't really want to talk to the police right now. You've been messing with me for two weeks. More like three. You're proud of yourself? You think this is fun? Katie, look... This... this isn't going to work. What happened to you? Where have you been? I went traveling... India... Asia. I lived and worked. I made my own money. I had to see what was out there to know the value of what is here... the value of this. Do you know what my big goal has been? It's been to stop thinking... to not think to not think that every time the phone rang it was you! To not think that every piece of mail in my mailbox was from you! To not think that every person I'd see approaching was you. I thought about you every bit as much as you thought about me. I don't believe you. Katie I was afraid to say this before. I love you. Katie. Hi, Katie Burke. Do you know anything about somebody being in the tunnel? Because the door was open and it's not supposed to be open and it's to remain closed at all times unless you're maintenance and you haven't been around to ask about it and I'm supposed to ask. No, I don't. I'm busy. That's not very nice. Should I tell you what I know? I was going to, but now maybe I've changed my mind. What are you talking about? Harrison Hobart is missing. That's two, isn't it? Embry is definitely back. I know I should've told you right away but I'm overdue on my thesis which is essentially one long string of endless numbers and finals are coming up and Embry has always had a sort of... chemical aversion to Harry Hobart and I don't... I don't know if he would do anything. I mean, he might but this... this whole experience is so far out of my normal range of things. Okay, slow down. Are you saying that Embry might have done something to Harrison? I don't know. I'm not sure. I don't know why I feel so comfortable with you. I know that I shouldn't. God, what am I doing here? It's okay. No, it's not. If somebody told me this was the rest of my life I think I'd kill myself right now. This isn't the rest of your life. This is right now. Yeah, well, right now my friends are out somewhere else and they're having a great time. Yeah? Yeah. Your old friends. Yeah. I'm just blowing off steam. I'm sorry, all right? So what's up with the Larkin kid, huh? Apparently he had a car waiting... a CTS Limo. It was supposed to take him to the airport. He never got in. Never used the airline tickets. The girlfriend says he's back. What's this girl like, Wade? What do you mean? Is she a nice girl? Yeah. Smart? What do you think? Yeah. What about you, Wade? Are you smart? Harrison is a responsible young man and we know he holds you in high regard. He thinks of you as a confidante. This is so unlike him. We're obviously very worried. If there's anything at all you could tell us... I don't know where Harrison is. I'm as worried as you are. This is difficult for me to ask and in no way am I impugning you. Was Harrison using drugs? What? He missed his father's birthday. Can you think of anyone he might have gone to visit... any new friends... people we don't know about? Uh, Harrison doesn't even drink coffee. He worries about damaging the instrument. We're grasping for anything. I'm sure that there is... some explanation. What do you think you're doing? Finding you. Do you know where Harrison is? The tree-hugger? I don't really keep tabs on him. Have you seen him lately? Wouldn't you like to know. You piss me off like nobody else, you know that? - Yeah? - Yeah. What you going to do about it? I want you to come away with me to the country house. Where is Harrison? I'll tell you at the country house. Sure he was in love with her. Harrison's a good guy. He mooned around, but he was sweet. He got his name on scientific papers when he was about 12. So, what did he know about anything? Do you think it was odd that he still liked a girl who hadn't shown him any real interest in over two years? I thought it was the opposite of odd. Guys are drawn to her like bugs around a bug lamp. For four years, I've had the privilege of watching it. That bother you, Julie? Think you see the horns of jealousy? You got my angle? You might want to ask yourself why you're so interested in her. They think it's a coltish vulnerability but it's just self-obsession. The pea brain says, "She needs saving" and the pea brain says, "I can save her" and then she doesn't notice them. So, they go crazy. It's about the missing dad and... validation. She just needs a friend. Embry. Embry! Detective. What are you doing here? Oh, right. Stalking Katie, I remember. Listen, I'm... I'm looking for her. I think this kid, Embry Larkin, is back. Who told you that? She told you that Embry's back? She's seen him? Do you think she's with him right now? I know. I'll keep asking you questions and you keep not answering them. Look, I'm just concerned about her. Detective, you seem like a pretty good guy... you do, you do... um, but Embry was the love her life. Ouch! He who snatched the maidenhead from the maiden. I shouldn't have said that. Do you want to come upstairs and have a drink? Bad Samantha! Bad Sam! I better go now. You fell asleep. It's been a long time since I've watched you sleep. Where were we? Oh, no. What did you do to Harrison? What did you do to Harrison? What did you do to him? Evisceration. Vivisection. Drawn and quartered. The quartering act. Dismemberment. And set him on fire. You arrogant, preening... bore! Who are you running back to, Katie? Not the tree-hugger. Not the townie cop. You're already the young professional... passionless, desiccated... smug. He slipped that under my door a couple of nights ago. Where's the old place? Suite 408. I'm sorry. I should have told you sooner. Can I keep this? And I saw him again. I went to his country house. I told him I never wanted to see him again. Well, I want to see him. I need to see this guy. Detective, please do me a favor. Sure. I'm done. Everyone's done. I'm not done. Detective! You should arrest that man. It's medicinal... glaucoma. I've got a prescription. Just don't play any Grateful Dead or you're all going in. Okay, we'll try not to. Hey, Jed, what do you say? Hey, long time, no see, Handler. Listen, if you're not too busy dipping into the drug seizures you want to take a look at these for me? Do a little compare and contrast of the handwriting. "My summer vacation. Working for the Supreme Court Justice" I bet he got in. Thanks, Jed. Hey, Handler, are you happy? You seem happy? Last Chance Dance? Yeah, that's where they call the wonks out of their cubbyholes and try to mate them. That would be you. Wonks? I'm a scientist. Pure science. It's sexy. Very sexy. Yeah, you want to go? Did she just ask me out? I believe so. I'll go. Katie! Oh, my God. Look what came! You got the job! I didn't look at this at all. There's a card in it. $10,000? For what, shipping all of your antiques? Airline tickets? Bob? Oh, come on. Don't be one of those annoying people who wins then acts like winning doesn't matter. Are you okay? Yeah. You know, you could've told me that Embry was back. I know. You're thinking about the cop aren't you? Maybe. Okay, visualize this with me. You're down in New York, consulting with Lou Gerstner or the head of GE, telling them how to buy South American countries but on the weekends you fly back up here to hang out with the cop, do cop things, maybe go to cop mixers. I like the cop. Yeah, um, I can see that. How much money do detectives make? Didn't your mother tell you that's a rude question to ask? No. She was always asking people that. If I guess right, do I get a prize? Maybe. A million bucks. I didn't want to insult you. You're not going to insult me. Look, you don't do police work for the money. What do you do it for? I don't know really. Most people do it because that's what their fathers did. Is that what your father did? He was a teacher. Hey. Hey... Oh... I guess I was dreaming. I was... just having a dream. What are you thinking about? That I just woke up next to a girl that I don't really know and I'm not hungover. How does that feel? Like free-falling through space. Can I tell you something and you won't get mad? You don't seem like a cop to me. You don't seem that happy doing it. Can I tell you something? I'm thinking about quitting. What would you do? I'd probably go up to my cabin and hammer some nails, figure out the meaning of life. Okay, I'll come. I didn't ask you yet. Sure, you did. I feel like an anvil has been removed from my ankle. Finishing your thesis? Finishing my thesis, school, everything. That's a good thing. You know, um... I know you're moving down to New York after graduation and... the transition from school can be tough. So I want you to know you can always call me, okay? 'Cause I'm down there a lot, and... I mean, I was actually wondering if maybe, um... ...if I could call you. I was nervous about telling you that I'm feeling better and that I won't be needing to see you anymore. Thank you for making it easier. Hey, Handler. Hey, Jed. You really off the job? I really am. You probably don't care but the samples were a match. The same person wrote the flyer and the college application. Well, that's just aces, Jed. You keep up the good work. See you around. Only thing is... ink tests show that the note was written two years ago, not last week. You people are derivative. You're not viewing a representation of hell. You are hell. You haven't produced a real artist in over a decade. ...screw this play... and screw you people. Uh... the last time I checked, a weekend lasted two days. Am I wrong? Did we switch to a French workweek while I wasn't looking? Oh, look who's jealous. Is there electricity or will you be using the light from the fireplace? I don't mean to pry but when do they want you to show up at McKinsey? I'm not sure. Absolutely not. What do you mean you're not sure? I mean I don't know. I haven't heard. Okay, uh, listen. Don't flip out but I'm thinking of deferring it for a year. What? It's only a year. I'm burned out. I'm tired. What's this cop done to you? He hasn't done anything. Well... maybe a little something. He doesn't even know this is what I'm thinking. I think go with him. So what if it takes up a year up of your life? I mean, God, everybody thinks that everything has to be so planned out you know, like our life is on a rail and one misstep, it all goes away. Basically... who knows? The last time you were this irrational was with Embry. Maybe that was the last time I was happy. Well, so I just said, "The hell with it" Then I went and climbed a mountain but I didn't bring enough water. So I got a little disorientated and the state police had to come and pick me up. It was really more embarrassing than anything else. Oh, um... Whatever happened with that cop, right? 'Cause he was kind of sweet on you, or...? Um... I don't know. I think he's in New Hampshire. Oh. Well, New Hampshire's nice this time of year. Come on... come on. It doesn't like to move the large numbers. Did you ever think you'd be up this late restructuring a media company? I thought I was going to be a rock star. I won't make stupid threats but you're not going to run away with this guy because wherever you go, I can follow you... even if it's to the woods in New Hampshire. Why don't you yell? Come on, I dare you. Hey, hey, are you okay? What's the matter? Let's just leave. What happened? He was here. Who? Embry? Well, where is he? Where'd he go? I'll take care of this right now. No, don't. That's what he wants. He'll hurt you. Just wait here. Why don't you join us? You're going to be great. You shouldn't be in here. I'm coming with you. Well, where do you think he is? He's right there. Hey. Embry, stop! I want to talk to you! Hey, Embry? Hey, Embry? Come on out. I'm a police officer. I've got a gun. I don't want to hurt you. Embry? Hey. I heard what you said up there. It was amazing. It was an incredible performance. I wasn't... acting. But we're... leaving together. Stick with finance, Katie. It's what you're good at. Embry! Embry! Embry, wait! We're leaving together. You think I'd take you to Europe? You'd just stand around awkwardly and I'd feel sorry for you. I love you! Really? We made love right over there. And now I can't get away from you fast enough. Embry! Look at you. You have no grace. What are you doing?! Crazy bitch. You can't come with me. Embry, why are you doing this?! Look at me! Embry! Katie! There's no one there. There's no one. No one. We're not going away together, are we? We're not going to New Hampshire together, are we? We'll get you help, okay? No. Listen. I want to come. I want to go with you. You'll be okay. I want to go with you. Katie, you can't come with me. Look. That's pretty. There's snow on the roofs. Katie, listen. I'm this close to making partner. We both know the rules about interoffice romance. I wish we could keep seeing each other but it's just not worth the risk. I hope we can still be friends.
