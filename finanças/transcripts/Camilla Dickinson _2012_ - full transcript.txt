Good afternoon, Miss Camilla. [piano music playing] Camilla. Good afternoon, Camilla. I bought you a little gift. Jacques came by just to see you. He brought you a present. Your mother tells me you're learning to sew this year, and so I thought... well, please. Why don't you go and open it? Camilla, do you have homework to do? All that Latin. I can't think how you keep it in your head. I never could. Thank you very much for the doll. It was stupid of me to get it. No, it's beautiful. [kissing] I just came back to get the box for the doll. [door opening] Father! Camilla. Evening, dear. Darling. Nissen. Rafferty. What...what time is it? Or are you early? I'm early. Jacques brought Camilla a doll. Wasn't that nice of him? It's in my room. A doll? I just came back to get the box. Really, Rose. Why would anyone buy Camilla a doll? She's not a child anymore. No. She loved it. Fix you a drink, Nissen? Oh, thank you, no. No, I...I must be going. So soon? Yes, I have a rendezvous across town. And I just stopped by to deliver the present for Camilla. I'm sorry if it seemed a bit juvenile. It's beautiful. Good night, Rose. Bonsoir. Rafferty. Good night. [door closing] Well? I have such a headache. I'm so sorry. I didn't know you would be coming home so early. Well, I stopped by Etienne's and booked us a table for tonight. Well that was sweet of you. If only I didn't have such a headache. It's fine. Rain check. [sighs] Seems a pity though to let the table go to waste. Do you mind if I take Camilla in your place? No, she might like that. And you're sure you wouldn't mind? Of course not. [knocking on door] Camilla? Yes? Your mother has a headache, so she's going to bed. I thought it might be fun for us to go out. How about it? All right. Quick as you can then. You have beautiful eyes. Have I ever told you that before? All of a sudden you've changed from a funny looking baby into a beautiful young woman. I wish I could look exactly like you. How would you like to wear my silver shoes tonight? Hmmm? If you wouldn't mind. If...if Rafferty asks you Ready, Camilla? Almost, Father. Except for these. Come on. Thank you. Our first dinner out together. Do you feel grown up? I suppose I must. Pascal I'll have a martini. And I think since this is our special evening, a small celebration is in order. Vermouth cassis for the lady, please. Luisa and I want to go to the planetarium. They're doing a show on Betelgeuse. I love Betelgeuse. It's Orion's shoulder star. You can see it all through the winter and sometimes into spring. Thank you. I think we'll have the filet mignon and yeah, a salad, please. Very good, monsieur. You've always been honest with me, haven't you, Camilla? Of course. Do you like the doll that that Jacques Nissen gave you? I...I don't care for dolls very much. No, I didn't think so. Do you like him? I don't know him very well. We...we don't talk very much. Well, what do you talk about? I...I talk about school. Luisa and I got in trouble last week for writing on the blackboard. We wrote, from Plato, "All learning that is acquired under compulsion has no hold upon the mind." That was why I had to stay after class that day. Do you and your mother and Nissen have tea together? Sometimes. They're more than just friends, aren't they? Aren't they? Come on, Camilla. You're not a fool. You can tell me the truth. It's all right. Excuse me. [knocking on door] Camilla, are you all right in there? [knocking on door] Camilla? You all right? Are you sure? I should never have let you drink. It's all right, Father. There's...there's no reason to tell your mother about this. Okay? So, you had a nice dinner with your father? Yes, thank you. What did you talk about? We talked about school. Did he mention Jacques? He asked if I liked the doll. I love you so so much. I love you too. [phone ringing] [phone ringing] Dickinson residence. Hold one moment, please. Miss Camilla. Hello? [muffled conversation] Luisa? [muffled conversation] Breakfast is on the table. [muffled conversation] Okay, where? [muffled conversation] Okay, I'll get there as fast as I can. [muffled conversation] Bye. Who was that on the telephone? It was Luisa. Would you mind terribly if I met her for breakfast? For breakfast? Good heavens, no. She seemed upset about something. She always seems to be. We have a perfectly good breakfast ready for you right here. Please, Mother. I have just enough time to make it. Will you be home right after school? I dunno. I...I guess so. Morning, Pumpkin. Goodbye, Father. Goodbye? What on earth? At Ashley Hall, they would never allow this sort of thing. [knife scraping] [knife scraping] Ladies. Hi, Jake. I'll have an egg salad sandwich, please. BLT, please. And a chocolate milkshake. It's them again, of course. Mona and Bill. What now? They had a fight last night when they came in. At first they tried to whisper so that Frank and I wouldn't hear. And then they whispered louder and louder and finally they yelled. And Mona ended up throwing an entire Beethoven Symphony at my father. From the number of crashes it sounded like the Ninth. Oh golly. And the worst part was when people stuck their heads out of windows and told them to shut up. How're yours? Oh, all right I guess. That means all wrong. The evil Jacques again? I caught them yesterday. Oh, eww. Were they kissing or something awful? And then he...he gave me a doll. I hope you threw it in his face. Do you think your parents wanted you to be born? What? My dear child, lots of parents have accidental children. Frank and I were planned, but I think it was a great mistake. Were you planned? I dunno. Do you love your parents? Of course. I don't mean the 'of course' kind of love. I mean really, as people. Yes. You're lucky. I don't like either of mine. Thanks. I brought the doll for you. It's really a lovely one, as dolls go. For me? Really? Thank you! You don't think I'm an awful dope still liking dolls, do you? Frank thinks I'm a dope. I wish Frank were back at boarding school this year. I don't think you're a dope. I don't think Frank thinks so, either. You don't live with him. Let's always be friends, even when you're a famous astronomer and I'm a famous doctor. And maybe you'll let me finally psychoanalyze you. You really should, you know. We have exactly six minutes till class. [knocking on door] Who is it? It's me, Mother. Come in, darling. You're home late after all. Be an angel and get me that throw. I think I have a cold. I'm freezing. How was school? And what was wrong with that odd Luisa after all? Not much. Well then why did you have to go racing out like that? Carter was very put out. Please don't hate me. I don't hate you. I love you, Mother. I know I'm not very mature sometimes. But how can you please a person when you seem to be the very opposite of what he wants. I...I don't have a brilliant mind the way he does. And I want so much more affection than he does. What if we have a tea party? Hmmm? They way we used to. Don't you think that would be nice? I have homework. I...I remember I...I left my Latin book at Luisa's place. So I have to I have to get that because I have a test tomorrow. But you just got home, and...and we have this nice tea. And can't you stay for a bit? I'm sorry, Mother. I don't like all this disappearing. It will not do. Why can't you be a little more responsible? Just a little. What am I supposed to cook for dinner, the curtains? Huh? What are you talking about? You! You drank all the food money! And that makes you the Queen of Virtue? How dare you! You What is it? Is Luisa home? No, she's not here. Why don't you call before coming all this distance? I'm sorry. I'll call Luisa later. I'll tell her. Hey! Camilla Dickinson? Is that you? Hi, Frank. What are you doing? I came to get my Latin homework. Luisa's not here. Please let's get out of here. Sure. Sorry about Mona. She gets her moods. It's all right. Luisa's told me. Luisa says you're very close to your mother. We used to be. We...we played like kids. It's different now. Luisa says you're planning to be an astronomer. Yes. What made you want to be one? Well my...my Grandmother used to teach me about the stars when we were up at her summer cottage. You can see so many more in the country. When I was little I decided that all I wanted was to learn more and more about them. Doesn't it sort of give you a shivery feeling to realize that about half the stars we see aren't there any more? It's just their light we see. They're gone. Never thought about it. It's as if God put them in the sky just for us. Do you believe in God? It's the only thing Luisa and I fight about. She always says I'm a dope to believe in God. Yes. Well, you know, oddly enough, so do I. But I very much doubt if the God I'm talking about is the same kind of God that you believe in. I don't believe in an old man in a nightgown and long white whiskers, if that's what you mean. Well, what do you believe? Well, I think God is blamed for a lot of things that aren't really his fault. It's really one of us that's done something wrong. But I...I don't think he plans it when people are good. I think he makes it possible for people to be much bigger and better than they already are. But we have to do it for ourselves. God's not gonna do it for us. You know, usually girls don't want to talk about important things. Poor old Luisa's a bore. And she's ugly as a mud fence, isn't she? She is not! She's...she's the nicest looking person I know. [laughing] Loyalty. Oh, I didn't mean any harm to your precious Luisa. You have to admit she's no glamour girl. I never said she was. I...she's far more attractive than they are, and far less cheap looking. It's getting late. I should go. I'll take you. Please don't bother. I'll...I'll be all right. Taking the subway? I've done it frequently. I know. But you're way too pretty to be going on subways and walking alone this late. How gallant. Oh, here it is. Could we maybe go to a movie or something sometime? Oh, yes please. What about Friday? I'll have to check. Okay. Well, let me know. Maybe meet you here around 7. Okay. Okay. Goodnight. Goodnight. Where have you been so late? I was I was out with Luisa's...brother, Frank. The rules are that you are to be here before dinner. You know that. I have been sitting here, worrying myself sick, wondering if you had been hit by a taxi or [thud] There is a thing called a telephone. Some well-bred children even use it even use it to call their parents to let them know whether they're alive or dead! Now, Rose. There's no need to get hysterical. And you, young lady, don't you have something you want to tell your mother? Hmmm? I'm very sorry, Mother. Father. I...I really didn't really mean to worry you. It won't happen again. Two tickets, please. Thank you. [door opening] Luisa! I didn't do it! Get up! Well, what's the matter? Don't you have school? It's Sunday. I don't approve of people spending the day in bed. Please Get up! let me sleep. Jeez, deaf. Get up! Now! It's an order! [slam] Well, I'll help you wash the dishes. I want coffee. I'll go downstairs and get you some. Can I have some money? (whispering) Turn around. Here. You are not a bad kid. I don't care what everyone says. (moaning) Why do we have these parties? Where is everybody? Your sister's gone to get coffee. Where were you last night? Want some fried eggs? I have had about as much as I can take from your sister this morning. I have tried to treat you both like reasonable human beings, like partners in an interesting venture in living, but all I get from either of you is disrespect and vulgar cracks. [knocking] [knocking] Come in! Idiot. Your arms can't be that full. Is...is Luisa home? Well, how are the chipper Dickinsons this morning? [door opening] Very well, thank you. Coffee! Lord, have mercy. Make it, and soon. Camilla. I'm sorry to keep you waiting, but as you can see, it was an emergency. I'll make the coffee, Mona. [crash] (Mona) Why can't you be more careful?! Get the hell out of my sight! Leave me alone! Both of you! Go! [slam] Sorry about that. It's not your fault. (Frank) See you, Camilla! So you went out with Frank Friday evening. Yes. So spill it. Was he nice to you? Are you in love? I think it's a little early for that. One date More than I've had. Did he try to kiss you? Please. Don't be ridiculous. Well he is 17. We went to a movie. But was it nice? Yes. [both giggle] Very. You look all romantic. [giggling] I've never seen you look this way. [both laughing] I wish I could get my parents to feel like this again. The way they used to. When they first met. Maybe a mooovie! Stop it! This is serious. Okay. Okay, I think it may be time for some lying. Pardon me? Tell them sweet lies, like in the movies. Make them think the other one said it. I can't do that. Look, do you want them back together, or do you want them divorced? Not so loud. Divorce. Divorce. Better get used to the sound of it. So I heard Mother say something funny the other day. Oh? She said that you were her knight in shining armor. Are you certain she was referring to me? Oh yes, she said your name. Mmph. I heard Father say something rather lovely the other day. What, darling? He said that you were his rose, like the flower. He said it all lovey-dovey. So...tell me something about the stars. What's the difference between a planet and a star? How do you tell them apart? Well the easiest way is that a star twinkles and a planet doesn't. So...tell me about planets. Well Mercury is closest to the sun, and then there's Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto. And Kepler thought that there ought to be a planet between Mars and Jupiter, and that's how Piazzi found the first planetoid, looking for a star... planet there, looking looking for a planet. Well I'm glad you know what you want to be. Most girls have no idea. You'll probably discover a new star or something. I hope so! I think I'd like to be a doctor. I used to want to be a pianist, but you got to be a lot younger than I am to really get anywhere A doctor like Luisa wants to be? No. Not like Luisa. What kind then? I hate death. I want to be on the side of life. I want to heal. What do you mean? It's kinda hard to hear. That's okay. Johnny Stephanowski was my best friend. I'd known him since we were kids. His folks own the record store Mona always goes to. Last year when Mona sent me off to boarding school, the Stephanowskis sent Johnny too. It meant a lot to them, being able to do that. A prep school meant that they were opening some kind of door for him. One of the kids on our hall got hold of a gun, a real one. Johnny was fascinated by guns, so he went over to look at this one. But as he held it, it went off. I ran down the hall as soon as I heard the shot. He didn't die right away. He just kept saying my name, over and over. They let me stay with him until he I haven't talked about this to anyone. Not the Stephanowskis of course cuz they miss him so much more. Would you come meet them with me? I think they'd like to meet you. Sure. Franky! Good to see you. And you. And who is this little lady? This is Camilla Dickinson. Very pleased to meet you, Miss Dickinson. Pleased to meet you too. Well Franky, why don't you take Miss Dickinson into one of the booths and give her a little concert? Thank you. Perfect. Camilla? Do you know Holst's 'The Planets?' No. What is it? It's kind of odd, but wonderful. It sounds like planets grinding against space or something. I can't believe I haven't heard this before. So then, my darlings, we worked in a hotel. I was the sous-chef in the kitchen, and I was very good with the borscht. No, she was better than good. She was magical. She made magic. Always. We will talk more about these silly quarreling parents of yours. I know a thing or two about romance. [both laugh] Thank you. Oh maybe the two of you will stay for dinner? Hmmm? Sure. I'd love to. I'll...I'll have to check with my parents though. Make a call. (voice on phone) Dickinson residence. Hello, Carter. It's Camilla. Is Mother there? I'm afraid that she wishes for you to come home right away. Please let her tell me that. Please come home right away. I have to go. Oh, that's too bad, dear. But we'll take a rain check on that. Could you get all your weekend homework done tonight maybe? Sure. Then maybe we could meet? Say around 10? Absolutely. Well, good night. Good night. We do not like you seeing this young man so much. Two dates And you've come home late from both of them. We have heard some things about him. They say he was mixed up in a boy's death. That's a lie! With a gun. He had nothing to do with that! He is a dangerous and shiftless boy with no responsibility. He has a job! He should be in school. He was! But he He was expelled. We know. Not the sort of boy you should be seeing. Besides you're you're far too young for this. You're only 15 years old. Do not walk away from me, Camilla! Camilla! [door closing] How are you this morning? I don't know. I don't know how I am either, so that makes two of us. My parents don't want me to see you. [sighs] They think you're dangerous. What do you think? Maybe a little. Maybe I am a little. Maybe you are too. [laughs] Me? Don't know anyone like you. How am I dangerous? Only in a very good way. And only to me. [sighs] I think I need to explain something to you. Because of the rumors you probably heard. About how I got kicked out of school. Yes, please. We used to have chapel every morning. After Johnny died, the headmaster preached this stupid sermon. He said that it was God's will that he was taken and all of that junk. If I thought God made that gun go off, I would not believe in him. I'd do everything I could to obliterate his name from the earth. But I don't believe it. I'll be damned rather than believe that! I walked out of the chapel while the headmaster was still talking. I slammed the chapel door. The next day I was called to his office, and I told him he was trying to make God in his own image instead of the other way around, like it should be. And he called me arrogant and threw me out of the school. Mona gave me hell about it. It was sort of like Galileo, wasn't it? Only Galileo recanted. He shouldn't have. Well I have to say I'm glad I got expelled, now. Even if I have to go back to school soon. Even if Bill and Mona get that divorce and I never see Mona again. It's worth it. I just wish they could be more well more like the two of you, really. What can we learn from the sages about Camilla's parent problem? Hmmm? "The way to a man's heart is through his stomach?" (Mr. Stephanowski) [laughs] [laughs] Good boy. "If music be the food of love, play on." Shakespeare. Yes. "Love conquers all things." Virgil. Yes, it does. And heals all. Who has the box of Russians? I need some Tchaikovsky right here. Thank you, my dear. Is there anything I can do to help them? Can you cook? No. It's time you learned. [laughs] What are you children doing tomorrow night? Hmmm? Do you have pink roses? Here. Thank you. Okay. They can't have any blemishes. Why? Part of the magic. [bell ringing] Thank you. Cheers. Cheers. So? They're smiling at each other. (giggling) Shush. Shush. This is a fancy restaurant, not the Saturday Matinee. [sighs] Did you have a good day? Same as usual. Work? Good? Thank you. Bon appétit. Borscht. You went to a lot of effort. I didn't do anything. There's no need to be modest, Rose. Hiring the extra help, nice touch. But I didn't. I thought I thought you did. Camilla. That little darling. That little darling. Right? [whispering] Yeah. That was very sweet of her. She must have spent a fortune on those roses. [whispering] Yes. I was truly hoping that you might have What? That it might have been you with the presents. And I thought Never mind what I thought, (Camilla) This has to work. They just need a little more time together. It will work. Start on the whipping cream. It's mousse time. I do want to know what you thought, of course. Really? Thank you. And now dessert. No. I don't think so. I trusted you. And you betrayed that trust. Please, Raff. That little escapade, Jacques. But that's all over now Yeah, so you say. I think we both know better. I've been wondering when we might consider a divorce. [crying] I'll be better. No. No, you won't. (whispering) Rafferty, please [crying] [screaming] No! No! Let me go! Be still. Be still. Rose, darling. Mother? Miss Camilla! [screaming] Let me be! [crying] Let me be. Get her out. Get her out. [crying] Let me be. Okay. Come with me. Oh God. What's going on? Your Your mother needs you to be strong. Sometimes when things are too much for some people, they try to solve their problems by trying to get out of them altogether. It's not a solution Fortunately it doesn't always work. Your mother tried to take her own life tonight. I thought you tried to kill her. Camilla. How can you say such a thing?! You don't really mean that. Look, I realize that you're upset. But Carter found her in time. She's gonna be all right. [whispering] Okay. Your mother is really still a child in many ways. She has loved and adored you, but you've been more like a a wonderful doll than a child to her. I am not a doll. [whispering] I know. I know. She doesn't have a lot of sense. She doesn't think, she merely feels. Like tonight. I'm gonna go check on her. You wait here. Okay? [phone ringing] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] Hello? Camilla? Yes. May I speak with your mother? No. What's wrong, Dear? Is Rose okay? You can't speak to her. I'm sure that you've realized how she and I feel about each other. I think it's time that you and I had a talk. For your sake and for your father's sake as well as Rose's and mine. I can't. Please, Camilla. Come to my office tomorrow. There are things that must be said. No. No! I will keep calling then until I speak to Rose. Don't...don't call. Okay. A ce soir. I love you. Oui, d'accord. Je t'aime. Bye. Hello, Camilla. I'm so glad you could come. This little meeting is our secret? Yes. I won't tell Rose if you won't. You can't. Mother isn't gonna see you ever again. You hate me very much, don't you? Hmmm? I will try to explain things. Your mother I can't stay very long. Your father has always worshipped your mother from a distance. That is not what she needs. She needs warmth and affection and tenderness. Your father your father is a cold man. Father is not cold! Have you ever seen him, I dunno, put his arms around your mother? Of course. You don't hate Rose, do you? How could I hate Mother! Then you you understand her? Children are not supposed to understand their mothers. Mothers are supposed to understand their children. There is a French expression to understand everything is to forgive everything. Mother isn't gonna see you ever again. That is not what she said just now on the phone. You're lying. That...that wasn't Mother. It was. She said If Rose loved me enough to try to do what she almost did the other night, then please. You...you had nothing to do with that! I think I did! Don't flatter yourself. Please, Camilla! You must understand that a woman as beautiful as your mother Shut up! I hate you! If you want to psychoanalyze me do it while the going's good. I won't offer again. Oh! Absolutely. Okay. Lie down. Lie down. Okay. Let's begin. Okay. What is your name, please? Camilla Dickinson. And your age? Fifteen. [giggles] Place of birth? Manhattan. Miss Dickinson, what man has had the most influence on your life in the past few months? [giggles] I don't think a real psychiatrist would start a therapy session like that. But if you must know, his name is Frank Rowan. [giggles] [laughs] I don't think a real psychiatrist would giggle either. What is your very first memory? I remember going into my mother's bedroom in the evening before Carter put me to bed. Mother would be sitting at her dressing table, and her evening dress would be laid out across her bed. It would still be smelling of the hot iron. She would tie a blue velvet ribbon into her hair, and she would be smoothing the tiniest bit of rouge into her cheeks. Strong influence of mother image. What's the matter? Nothing. I don't want to be beautiful. I don't want to look like a rose or a camellia or any kind of flower. I wish that people were still telling me what what a pity it is I don't look like my mother. I think you have to stop repressing everything you feel. That's what Freud would say. I don't think he's right about that. [door opening] (Mona) So the conquering hero returns at last. Where did you spend the night, the gutter? (Bill) Don't be ridiculous. Oh! You stink! Don't you care that your children are out wandering the streets? How can you be so unfeeling? Out, please! Oh, get away from me! Stop! [sounds of fighting] (Bill) [coughs and laughs] (Mona) Stay away from me. Oh! Owww! Just stay away from me, you stinking hobo. Camilla? Frank. What's wrong? I...I can't Come on. My mother, she What? Hello, Mr. Stephanowski. Hello, Camilla. Frank. Is Mrs. Stephanowski here? Yes, she's right upstairs. Pamela! Franky, give me a hand with this box of Beethoven, will you? Angel girl. Come here. I was wondering about your borscht recipe. I just happen to have some beets. Come, let's go upstairs. We'll make some. Madame. [giggles] [both laughing] Good bread, good beets, good God, let's eat! To my bride. As lovely as the day she married me. May she always dance. To my prince. [clink] To young love. Indeed. [door closing] So you're finally home. Sorry to be late. You missed supper. So did your father. He had to work late. Oh. Sorry, Mother. Carter made roast lamb with mint. I had dinner. With who? Camilla, this is unacceptable. Your behavior is completely out of control. I'm not the only one out of control, Mother. Why astronomy? Why not bricklaying or opera? Why that? Because because the stars give you hope, in something bigger than all the nonsense on this planet. What do you know about sex? I don't know. Enough. Well, didn't your mother tell you or anything? Of course. Probably about all the birds and the bees and all that stupidness. Well, sort of. There was this book. Do you know what a man looks like? Naturally. I mean undressed. No. That's too bad. I do think one should be prepared. Hadn't you better get on with psychoanalyzing me? Do you think you'd like it? Doing...you know...that? I don't know. Maybe it's sort of like ripe olives. They seemed repulsive at first, but now I'm mad for them. Mona went through a phase of drinking nothing but Dark Eyes. That's a martini with two black olives in it. Camilla? Tell me about you and Frank. That's really none of your business. You know, if you need analysis, Frank needs it worse. He's just as apt as not to throw you over tomorrow. I beg your pardon Has he kissed you yet? No. Well, I'm surprised. Frank loves kissing girls on the first date. What's wrong with you today? It doesn't sound a bit like him, protecting you like this. If you were five years older, I'd say it was the mercenary streak in him. What do you mean? Oh, just that I might think he'd come to "wive him wealthily in Padua." Clever, aren't you?! You're a dope if you let yourself be at Frank's beck and call, you know. No man wants a girl he can have easily. And how could you possibly know that? Let's just forget it. Let's...let's go for a walk or to a movie or something I can't. Why not? [door opening] Hi. [whispering] Hi. What are you doing home? Got a date with Camilla. You said you would spend the day with me. I just spent the whole morning with you. Well, fine. You two deserve each other. Come on, Camilla. Let's get out of here. [door closing] What's with her? I think she's beginning to realize that we might be a thing. A thing? And she's suddenly jealous. [laughs] A thing? She implied that you don't usually stick with girls very long. I haven't before. Hey, Franky! Who's the new one? Um, Camilla, this is Pompilia. So, coming over to lunch soon? No. I won't be coming over any more. I told you that. I'm sorry. Hey! You'll be back! You know you like the way that I cook! Hey, you don't got to be so mean! Come and see me soon, Franky! (Rose) Forgive me, Rafferty. Soon we'll be gone and it will be better. I...I...I promise. Camilla. You're...you're going away? Where were you this time? I was seeing...a friend. A friend? Don't you mean Frank? Yes, I mean Frank. I am in love with Frank Rowan. Oh, in love. I see. Well, I'm delighted you've finally decided to let us know. Come with me, please. [door closing] Let's sit. I don't understand your behavior lately. I'm sorry. It's not your fault. I blame myself for this. No, you shouldn't. It's...it's not you. You know, after what what's been going on with your mother the last couple of days, it's been less than kind of you, to say the least, to constantly be running off to the Village. And Frank, I mean you're far too young to be so...so serious. Everything's gonna be all right. Why don't you go in there? Tell your mother you're sorry and that you love her. How can I tell her I love her when I don't? Camilla, you don't know what you're saying. I know it's awful. I'm numb. I just...I just can't. I can't. Well, can...can you at least try to say you're sorry? I mean can you do that much? [whispering] Okay. [door opening] Mother Yes? I'm sorry if I've made you unhappy lately. I have to go. So soon? I'll be back as soon as I can. Look, I know I've been a little disagreeable, of late. Too much to do. All right, honey. Mother, what is going on? We're going to Italy. Italy? When? Will we see Grandmother? That's just it, darling. Rafferty and I are going alone. Oh. Oh. We've both felt that you've changed this winter. Luisa and Frank Rowan haven't been good for you. It hasn't been Luisa and Frank. But you have changed. Don't you know why? You of all people? You didn't want to have me, did you? Camilla! You mustn't say such things like that, ever! I love you! Mother You mustn't ever say anything like that. I don't mean you...you don't want me now. I mean you didn't want me then. Of course I...I wanted you, Pumpkin. Do you mind terribly about us going to Italy? Well, I will...I will miss seeing Grandmother. I don't mind staying in New York. Darling. You're not staying in New York. What? We both feel that it would be best for you to spend the rest of the year at Ashley Hall. Oh,no. Ashley Hall was one of the happiest times of my life. You will love it there. It's all decided. I...I don't want to leave New York! I...I like my school! Please get me a a governess or a companion and...and...and let me stay! Something! [whispering] There's nothing Please, Mother! Camilla, you know that I want to give you everything in the world that you want. You know that. But Rafferty...it's all settled. You're sending me away because of Frank and Luisa? That's part of it. But we thought that you would like it. I was terribly excited to go to Ashley Hall. Excited?! Are you serious?! Just because for the first time ever I have a social life, you have to send me away to prison?! Is me being happy so dangerous that that you have to wreck it?! I hate you! [crying and screaming] [crying and screaming] May I speak to Frank, please? It's Camilla. I...I...I need to see you. Camilla! What's wrong? I have to go away in a week. Mother and Father are...are going to Italy for the winter, and so they're sending me to this girly boarding school. Oh, no. I feel like my real life just started. And now it's over. You've got a week. Let's make it amazing. Let's see each other every day. Yes. Well, what should we do? I haven't got much money, so it can't be anything too terrific, but let's not waste time in the movies. You want to ride on the Staten Island ferry? That's...that's one of the classic things. (Camilla) [laughs] "We were very young, "we were very merry, we rode back and forth all night on the ferry." Are you cold? Do you want to go inside? No, I like it out here. Me too. We could be going out into the open sea. I can't see anything, can you? It's like we're in a fairy tale. Under a spell or something. Oh! [both laughing] You know, I can't make sense of any of this. How can God let things like this happen? Maybe what we need is a new God that people like me or you or your parents could really believe in. We need a God who's big enough to deal with things like this. To make it okay. Somehow. Maybe it isn't God who needs to be bigger. Maybe it's us. What do you mean? You might think it's silly. Tell me. Well, I've always wondered What if before we were born on earth we were on another planet where no one could see. We hadn't the slightest idea what sight was. So what if after we die, we move onto a new planet with a new sense, just as important as sight but something which we could never conceive of now. And then after we'd finished on that planet we'd move onto another planet, and...and....and so on and on, planet after planet, learning and growing until at last maybe we'd be ready for heaven. Ready to be part of an eternal being. Part of God. I could believe that. What would you think of someone who tried to commit suicide? What? No, not me. Someone else. They say it's the unforgivable sin. It's murdering yourself. Do you think it's truly unforgivable? I don't know. You worry me when you talk about things like that. It was my mother. My mother tried to... A couple of weeks ago. Oh. I don't understand my mother or my father. If being grown up means screaming at each other all the time and trying to kill yourself I don't want to grow up. I know what you mean. She has scars now. On her wrists. Let's not go home yet. Let's go somewhere special. Yes, let's. We can't go in here. Yes, we can. I know a guy. Come on. If any cops come in, we'll just go out the back. But they hardly ever do. You come here a lot I guess. A time or two. With Pompilia? Once. Oh, and with Mona and Bill. But this time, I want to dance. I don't know how to dance. Come on, I'll show you. Trust me.

I'll be waiting by the school steps to walk you home. Good night. [elevator dings] To understand everything is to forgive everything. Hmmm? [crying] [door closing] [crying] Camilla. [crying] Where have you been? I thought you were asleep. Don't. Don't judge me. You have your whole life ahead of you. Stop! Really, it wasn't as awful as it seemed. Why not? Because I'm never gonna see him again. And I don't love Jacques, not the way I love your father. [door opening] [door closing] Luisa. Where's Frank? He's gone. Gone? With Bill. To Cincinnati. But he Mona and I aren't going to Cincinnati. We're staying here. Oh. Excuse me. So Franky's left, and your little heart is sore. I know, my darling. I just...I don't see why he didn't Oh. He came by this morning to say goodbye. It's a bad thing he's going through. Yes. He left something for you. He wanted to give you this himself. He waited for you, but then he had to go. Thank you. [door opening] Your friend Luisa is waiting in your room for you. I don't want to see her. I think that you do. Here. Frank told me to give this to you. I wasn't going to. I almost threw it away. Frank told me to take the letter up to you at school. He told me to be sure to give it to you before school was out. But you... How could you do that?! How could you? I thought you were my friend! I'm sorry. I guess I just wanted you to hurt too. Well it...it worked. And now he's gone. I'm so sorry. I could have said goodbye. When did you start hating me? When you picked him over me. You're my best friend. Were. And...and then you weren't. I never stopped being that. Well it felt like you did. It felt like you It felt like you loved him more than you loved me. I loved you both, you idiot! [crying] Can you ever [whispering] Come here. I...I have to go back to Mona, now. But I'll see you at school tomorrow? At least for the next few days? [whispering] Yeah. (Frank) Camilla, Bill and Mona busted up today, so that means I have to go with Bill to Cincinnati. Luisa's staying with Mona. Please come to the record store after school so that I can explain, and we can say goodbye. I'll be waiting. Love, Frank. [piano music playing] I need to talk to you. What is it, darling? You know that school you want to send me to? I have something to say. That's already all been decided, Camilla. I know you need to go away, and I know I have to go to school. But not a school for gracious living. Not Ashley Hall. Mother, I'm not you, and...and I would just wither there. What if the school were a science school, somewhere where I could learn more about astronomy? Not Ashley Hall? Camilla I don't think it's such a good idea. You never consulted me when you made these plans. I...I think you at least owe it to me to listen to some of mine. What difference does it make which school I go to, as long as it's a good one? You can afford any school. And Frank and Luisa will not be there. Well, that is true. I am going to be an astronomer. And I'm going to start now. Please think. You will be away in Italy. Let me choose where I want to be. (lecturer) Betelgeuse is in the constellation of Orion, the Hunter. It is the first star whose diameter was measured. It is 215 million miles in diameter, and it is 190 light years distant. (Camilla) I understand why Luisa did what she did. As awful as it was, I'm not sure I could have said goodbye to your face. But what I would have tried to say was that if I had never met you, I wouldn't have been able to stand up for myself. Thank you for that. And for the ferry, and the record album, and the dancing. This won't last forever. Someday I'll be home. And maybe I will see you then.
