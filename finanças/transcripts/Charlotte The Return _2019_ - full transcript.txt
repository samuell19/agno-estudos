Daddy! Daddy! Honey. I heard a monster. Uh-oh. What did it, uh... What did it sound like? Was it like a bear? No, it sounded like a monster, a real one. Oh, no. Is Tilly scared? A little. Well, what do we say? One, two, three. Nothing scares me. Can you say it with me? Okay. One, two, three. Nothing scares me. Good. You feel better? Can you turn on the light? No, no, wait a minute. I think, I know what's really bothering you. Mommy and I have been fighting a lot lately. And... Daddy, I don't- Let me finish, okay. You just get so tired, so frustrated when things just don't go the way you want them to. You wanted a raise not just a promotion. You wanted Henry to be healthy for good this time. You wanna give mommy the life that you promised her when you got married, one with vacations, huh, dinners out, and not just to Olive Garden or Applebee's. Wanna know a secret? I hate Applebee's. Yeah, and you know what? So does Mommy. Daddy. But, she knows that that's the best we can do, and she's a good woman, so she doesn't say how unhappy she is. But I can tell. In the way she looks at me, the sigh she lets out every morning. She loves you, she loves Henry there's no doubt about that. But, I know that she stopped loving me a long time ago. And, you know, the truth is that moms and dads don't have to love each other to stay together. And sometimes, I think... Sometimes it's gotta be better that way. It's gotta hurt less, right? I mean, it must. There's no such thing as monsters, honey. Life is scary enough without them. But they are real. I heard one. They're as real as Tilly. He's real. Now we've talked about that. He's a real doll. You said that mom made him with her love. You know, you're right. Can we please turn on the light? No, there's no... See, there's nothing to be afraid of. Nothing at all. Jesus! One, two, three. Nothing. You're a mess. You wanna join me? God, yes. I meant to pick up Henry's meds. It's taken care of. Do I need to pick up Mary Ann at school? No. Not anymore. Jess. Don't. There's this song stuck in my head. It's not really even a song. I really screwed up. God, what is it? I'm so sorry. That's it. One, two, three. My sweet pea went and killed his whole family. We suffered, you know. None of us went quickly, not Henry, not Mary Ann, not even me. You couldn't even do that right. This isn't real. No. No, it's not. Daddy, you don't have to be alone. You can be with all of us. One, two, three. I saw a monster, and he was me. Hello. Hello. Ugh, what the fuck! A stupid toy. No, please! Oh, my god! No, no, no, no, no! No! Shit, shit, shit! You motherfucker! Go to hell! Ah, stop! No! Mom. So, you sure I never mentioned my friend Dennis to you before? Yeah, I'm sure. Maybe you were too young to remember, huh? Last time he saw you, you were just knee high. Maybe. Yeah. Dad, can I please go to the washroom? Just hang on let me stop. But no further information on numbers to be released until relatives have been informed. Law enforcement officials say the attacker was a 46-year old man who had ties to the Ontario school. One went missing yesterday night. So, it's been quite a while. How you been? I've been good. Just glad we finally decided to get together. I mean, we've been talking about it so long, right? So you're Paul. Yeah. Dad, told me all about you. He's been telling stories, sending pictures. Ain't nothing like the real thing. Isn't that right, dad? You guys should get somethin' to eat. The food's really good. No, we're okay. You're not hungry? You're not in a hurry, are you? Well, we ate already. Had muffins, right. So. Muffins. That ain't much for an appetite, Dad. Another top up? Check please. ♪ You got a heavenly face ♪ And a sinful tongue Oh, God, it smells in here. Don't say that, okay. Just be cool. You sure you're not hungry, Dad. No, I'm fine. Thank you. 20 years. - Yeah. - Yeah, hmm-mm. Been 20 years since your dad and I were in college. Damn, we shared a lot of courses, didn't we? Yeah, we had quite a few. What were they again? Hey, Paul. What should we do today? Hmm, you got any ideas? What do you think, Dad? What about fishing? Huh, what do you say, Paul? Your dad ever take you? Uh-uh. Really. Well, now I don't know about a father who never taught his boy to bait a hook or cast a line? Something special about all that time alone on the water. Allows for a special kind of bonding, you know? We're more into sports. Right, buddy? Paul. Hey. It's okay, Dad. I guess, the ride up must have tuckered him out. Just let him nap. Or would you prefer him awake? See you hadn't thought this through, have you? Hmm? Hmm? Maybe this whole thing was some kind of misunderstanding. So what you gave him is it gonna hurt him? So he's just gonna sleep. I thought we understood one another. Be back in an hour. Or [sighing], you can go home to your wife. Hey, oh, son, that's okay. That's okay. Don't worry, don't worry. Don't worry it's okay. It's all right. Son. What the? It's something, isn't it? I had a feeling. Wasn't sure, of course. I knew my gut was telling me something. Then I had a look at Paul. He was untouched. Not a mark on him. Then I thought that's odd. Now it all makes sense, doesn't it? No. No, none of that here. Don't hide it. Don't hide it. It's really beautiful once you get used to it, once you start to recognize yourself. I suppose it's a little off pudding at first. I can't remember. I don't know how you hid it for so long. Must have been hell. Perhaps it was for the best. No bad habits to break. Paul. Paul, wake up. Wake up. Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. Paul. Paul. Wake up. Are you alright? Are you okay? What? It's all right. It's okay. Paul. Let go of him. Let go of him. No! It's okay, Paul. It's okay now. It's okay. It's okay now. God loves you, but God hates the sin in you. God did not call you to such perversions. The perverted homosexual spirit and the spirit of delusion and confusion it has deceived many men and women. Homosexual acts are an embarrassment to the church. You're an embarrassment to yourself, your family. But fear not God is a deliverer. A reading from the gospel according to Romans 1:26. For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions where their woman exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature. The word of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Please join me for the holy Eucharist. Jesus himself, his flesh and blood. I am not worthy to receive you. But only say the word, and I shall be healed. Amen. I am not worthy to receive you. But only say the word, and I shall be healed. Warden. Chief Administrative Official in a prison. Hey, mom. Plant or animal that lives in or on an organism from which it derives sustenance or protection without benefiting the host and usually doing harm. In time, these jailers will take everything, rob you of every wish, hope, and desire. It's up to you to make a plan to break free, to escape. After all these years, I have my opportunity. Four more months the kids off to college. Pull out the savings, buy a truck, leave, never look back. After 45 years of existence, my life is about to begin. What's the matter, sweetheart, had another bad day? Now you're waiting for me to ask you about it, but I won't because you're just gonna tell me anyway. Here it comes. Three, two, one. They're expecting me to go in on Saturday again. Can you believe that? Well, they don't appreciate you or your contributions in that branch. They really don't. Your contributions? What exactly should they appreciate, your GED or your half year of community college? You're on time every day, so are my bowel movements. You're a knot on a bolt on the ass-end of a useless cog. They should've fired you years ago. Please don't touch me, you pig. You okay? Yeah. Uh. Well. Well, what? We're having a baby like it's nothing. Like it won't ruin everything. Anything but that. You're dying. You're leaving. You're cheating. Anything but that. Haven't you done enough, taken everything. You're enjoying this aren't you? All a part of a plan, isn't it? Checkmate. She can lock the door, and throw away the key now, can't she? It's over again. But it can't be over. We've waited too long to just give up. There's a solution, always a solution. We can beat her. You're smarter than her. Get us out of this, John. What are you doing? Hmm? Go on, go on, no peeking. Go. Okay. Don't stop. Almost there. You okay? Yeah. Fine. Good. Brought it on herself. Don't forget that, John. It's almost eight. You getting up? Hey. What? What's wrong? Depression. Oh, she's good. Didn't see this one coming, did we? But we're on to her, aren't we, John? She can't act sick forever. Thanks. What an actress. Think you've won, huh? Fooled the kid, family, the doctor, your boss. But not me. So, I've been thinking. Is that what you call it? About how much this whole thing's upset you. Yeah, it's been tough. But, sometimes things there're just not meant to be. I guess not. But that doesn't mean we can't try again, right? You see. She'll never quit. The depression thing was a ploy. And now she's going for the kill!! You know that, don't you? She'll never stop. Until her last egg is dried up, she'll keep trying. After that, she'll want to adopt. It'll never end. But there's still a chance for freedom, for everything we've dreamt about. Leave it to me, John. Mom's been acting funny. Keep an eye on her, okay? I'm worried about her. I want you to keep an eye on Mom, okay? Why? Well, dear, the pills, the depression, I'm just afraid she might do something stupid. She may hurt herself. Go on. I'm just not sure about all those pills she's taking, you know. Say it the right way, idiot. Say it. I'm worried she might hurt herself. What are you doing? Don't think, John, just follow. It's what you're good at. Wake up, honey. Have some tea. It'll make you feel better. Wake up, honey, and have some tea. What are you doing? Pour the tea. John. Don't do this. Feed that bitch the tea. Get back in there. Want another 20 years of hell? You'll never have this chance again! We'll never get away from this hell hole! Do it! Finish it! Set us free! Stop thinking it's not your strong suit. Let me take care of this like always. Don't start getting ideas now. Just do what comes naturally. Give me control now! No. Stop it, don't touch me. What are you doing? Keep that thing away from me. What are you doing in there? Don't do it. Why aren't you at work? Be right out, honey. Get it away from me. Dad, it's like 8:30. Dad! Yeah, you take the car, honey. Really? Yeah, I'm gonna stay at home this morning. Alright, see you later. Wait. You're gonna kill us. Stop, listen to me. I've only ever wanted to make you happy. I'm not your enemy. It's not my fault they've disappointed you. I wish they made us happy, gave us everything you need. But they don't, do they, John, and they never will. I'll never accept that. We can start over, do things your way. Listen to me, John. Calm down. I'd never hurt you. I want the best for you, for us. I understand you're scared, but don't do this. You're not thinking it. Stop and think. Listen to me. We can fix this, fix everything. Stop it. Get your hands off me! Listen to me, John. Undo the belt. Calm down, be reasonable. We can talk this out. You and I we've always been together. Let's not fight. That's right, John, relax. Think about it. I'm your best friend. I'm the one you know. No one knows you better. No, John. Don't do this, John! You'll bleed out. You'll die. Don't do this. How will you explain this to Jordan? You can't do it. You don't handle pain well, John. Do you know what a razor feels like being pulled across your flesh? Idiot, you think this is the answer. Pull it out now. Stop, look at the blood. You're bleeding it's not going to stop. Listen to me you can still turn things around. We can sew you up. It's not too late. What are you doing? You don't understand what you're getting yourself into, you idiot. It's not gonna work, John. You're gonna die alone in this dark, filthy basement like a rat, like an insect. You love me so much, don't you. She's gonna remarry, get a new daddy, bring another rat. You bastard. No one is going to remember you because you didn't matter. Because at all things you failed took the easy way out. Traitor. You can't get rid of me. You're not going anywhere. I'm a piece of you. Cutting me out won't change that. You wasted your life, John. You didn't make a difference. You failed your family, failed in school, failed in your career. You're bleeding to death. You're going to die, John. So are you. Dad, it's 8:30! Dad! Hon. Don't use up all the hot water, okay. I need a shower too. I skipped the shower at the gym this morning. James. What are you doing? He doesn't know anything. You're just being paranoid, relax. So how was your weekend? It was amazing. I worked out, did some shopping, had an extramarital affair that's about it. What about you? You're disappointed in me. I know it was wrong, completely and utterly. But, at the time it felt right. I mean, the guy was cute. I was horny, and FYI, a vibrator most definitely isn't a replacement for human contact. So it happened. What are you doing here? I sent a text. I didn't get a text. Are you certain? 'Cause I did hit send. I'm very certain. Well, anyway, I'm here now, so why don't you invite me inside? No. Does, uh... Does he know about our extracurricular activities. Extracurricular, I like that word. I literally like how it feels rolling about my mouth. Extracurricular. Why don't you try it? Look, I don't have time for games. So, if you don't mind, please leave. Wow. Last week you couldn't get enough, and now you just wanna see me go. That's, uh... That's a little rude, don't you think? Do you want money, is that it? Oh, no, no, no. Money does not take the shame away. Somethings, they just stay with you forever. Look, I was lonely and things happened. But I don't wanna hurt my husband over a little indiscretion, so please. Oh, but there is sin in your indiscretion. It molds to you with great certainty. Please, let go of the door. Let go. Fine. I'll leave. But you'll be seeing me again. Not tomorrow. Not next week, but sooner than later. Just leave! Castigate. That's another one of my favorite words. To castigate it feels oddly pleasing in my mouth like a piece of watermelon flavored hard candy on a warm summer day. Castigate this, asshole. Motherfucker. Fuck, fuck, fuck shit, shit! Oh, my god! James. This guy has been following me. It started at the gym, and now he's followed me home. He's delusional. He thinks we've been together. I'm so scared. That'll work. James, baby, I need to speak to you. It's really important. Infidelity, I like it. It just rolls off the tongue, don't you think? Getting spun out isn't gonna make him call you any faster, you know. Just like, kickback. You're tripping. I'm not stressing anyone. If I were hypothetically waiting for a call, he would be blowing my phone. Does your ass get jealous of all the shit that comes out of your mouth? So rude. Come on, let's do this. I'm good. I didn't ask if you were good. So come on. I don't see why I have to go. Alright, beat this car, come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Damn, girl. Hello. Yo. This is so hood. I love it. Breaking and entry. What do you know about the hood, Keisha. I will let you know that my minority status isn't diminished by my style or education, okay. I'm 100% Afro-centric with a dash of Latino goodness, boo, boo. Don't you parents even realize that they're living proof that two wrongs don't make a right? Whatev'. So, where is this girl? 'Cause I'm hungry and bored. I don't know stop riding my bumper, Keisha. Maybe she's outside playing Candy Crush. Or maybe she's busting out a grumpy. A what? A grumpy? You know [chuckling], the kind that makes you strain so much that the veins in your neck pop out. You asked. I'm gonna go check the bedrooms. Okay, you do that. But, if you ask me, I'd check the bathrooms first. I brought a friend. What the fuck? Sam. What? Did you find her? Yeah. Great, so we can get the fuck out of here. Come over here first then we can leave. Don't stop. She was in the bedroom all this time. So, she wasn't taking a shit. She wants to meet you. It's what you wanted. Now let her go. Release my sister. Jessica. No. Jessica, don't leave me. Please stay. No, goddammit you promised! No! You promised! Wait where are we going? I thought we were getting something to eat? I have to pick up something from a friend first. You wanna come along? I promised it'll be quick. I guess, at least I can put my lipstick on inside. The world is asleep, dreaming peaceful, safe. These are the hours I love when all that I hate is silent and unconscious. The world is different when people are asleep, better. I wish they would sleep forever. But they always wake up and ruin everything.
