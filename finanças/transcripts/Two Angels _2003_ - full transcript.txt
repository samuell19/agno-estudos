"TWO ANGELS" IRAN - THE 1990's A HOLY CITY AT THE MAUSOLEUM O Saint, you who can grant all wishes... intercede before God for my forgiveness. I was beside myself. You know well, it wasrt my fault! I will tell you everything. If not to you, then to whom can I speak? O Saint, you know that it was for his own good... to lead him to the right path. I swear I wanted only good for him. Do you remember? I came here to pray for a child. You should never have answered my prayer. Ali, my boy, that's enough! Go and dry yourself. Pour more water. I want to be nice and clean! Is it you getting married this evening? It's a neighbour. What's it to you? Hossein, there isn't a wedding every day! Let the boy have some fun. That's enough! Get up. We'll go to the Mausoleum to pray. Can't he pray here? You always say the same thing! At the Mausoleum, one is closer to God. Get moving, Ali! We're going! Bring the book tomorrow. I need it. I'll remember that. - And I'll bring yours back... - Ali, isn't that your father? I'd better go, he's waiting for me. So my boy, how are things? Come on, I'll buy you some clothes. How come? Is business good? Don't be smart. Come, you'll see. Here is the latest news. We are approaching the end of the presidential term... of Hashemi Rafsanjani. The electoral candidates will be presented... next week. Next bulletin at noon. How much is the jacket? - 10,000 tomans. - 10,000? - It's a bargain. - We'll see. Take it off, Ali! Anyway, it doesn't suit you. Give it to me. Try this one, it's nice. It really suits you. Doesrt it suit him? So does the jacket. It all suits him. It's perfect. How much? 3,000 tomans. 3,000? - 2,500 will that do? - I'm giving it away! We're in a hurry. Here's 2,500 tomans. God be with you! Take it. God be with you. Congratulations, Ali. Go in peace. Goodbye. Greetings. Ali, I want you to attend the Koranic school... so that you'll prosper in this world and in Paradise. Mollah Mohsen, the head, is a friend. Shall I ask him to enrol you? So that's what the shirt was for? Ali? Ali, come back. I just mentioned it, don't get angry. Let's go. How many would you like? Four. - How many, little one? - Four. 40 tomans. Who's this for? And you, how many? Less fire, we're not making tarmac! What will I give my customers? How many do you want? 50 tomans. Dad, I'm late. Deliver the bread. Then you can go to school! I haven't got time! Your books stay here till you get back. Go on! Lower the fire, the bread is burnt! - How many do you want? - Four. - 40 tomans, take them. - I'll be late, they'll expel me. Fine, so much the better! You will work here and be a man! What are you doing? Are you disobeying me? Where's the broom? Come back! Stop! Come back! I'll cut you to pieces! Bastard, stop! Hello. What do you want, young man? Have you never seen a nay? Come here. Come and sit down, I'll make some tea. You see this flock? Each one is loyal... obedient, faithful. I play the nay to them... and they watch me, open-mouthed. What are you doing here? Are you lost? Yes. Can I see it? Do you know how to play? Is it hard? If you have a passion for it, no. Give it to me. Here, like this. Put your fingers here. Raise the middle one. I'm going to teach you. Put your fingers here... and the thumb there. Raise the middle finger. Rest it against your teeth. Blow like an extension of your breathing. While you practice, I'll make the tea. Bastard! Have you no shame? You've turned away from God! I'll smash that thing! You're always beating my son! Look at him, a real clown! - I'll teach him! - He's done nothing wrong! You've always spoiled him! It's your fault! Go and wash your mouth out! And no more stupidity! He'll do it, then he'll do his homework. No! His studies are the cause of all this! I want an end to it! How can I make you see? Do you understand? Wash your mouth out and make your ablutions! I understand you... but he's my child too. Let him breathe a little! 1,200 tomans. - Hello. - Hello, madam, how are you? Thank you for your kindness. Thank you very much. Look, I took a lot of trouble with these. I would rather have kept them. It's true, they're pretty. Here. That's not enough! I'll be making nothing! Here. Are you satisfied? Give thanks to God. Thank you, again. How are you? Are you well? And you, how are you? - Not too bad. - How is Hamid? He's okay, but the university is on strike. He's staying in Tehran. Was that Ali playing the nay? Yes. But, sadly, his father broke it. Ever since, Ali hasn't eaten. He stays on his own and cries. If he's so fond of the nay, send him to a teacher. His father would kill him! Besides, where would I find one? There are music schools in Tehran. If you like, I'll ask Hamid to give me an address. Where are you going? What do you want? - I've come to learn the nay. - "The nay"? I was told I could study the nay here. Where are you from? The provinces? Two hours away by road. - And that's why you came to Tehran? - What's going on? So, young man? I want to enrol. - What is your name? - Hello, Mr. Nahid. - What's your name? - Ali. Okay, let's see what I can do. Your father wants you to complete your studies at the Koranic school? To enrol here, you will need his permission. If my father finds out, he'll kill me. How can I get it? - How old are you? - Fifteen and a few months. Where are you staying in Tehran? Nowhere. I come in the morning and go home at night. Have you been to Tehran before? Yes. I came with my parents and got lost. On my own, I paid attention. Good. Wait here for me. I'll go and see the principal. Maryam, did you see the country boy? - Of course. - It's too late now. It's you who wants to learn the nay? Yes, why? No reason. Where are you going? I told you to wait there. The principal didn't like my face. What principal? He's in his office, I've just spoken to him. Come, we'll go and see him. If my father finds out, he'll kill me. Don't worry. Artists often use false names. You can have one. - What will you choose? - I don't know. Babak, Bahram, Sohrab... Which do you prefer? Sohrab. No! No. It's impossible. The courses have already begun. The pupil would never catch up. I've already told you no. Really. Goodbye. Goodbye, for now. Principal, this is Sohrab, the young man I told you about. His desire to learn the nay has brought him here. You know what it is, a nay? - Nay... - Your "nay", it sounds like a "no". - What's your name again? - Sohrab, Principal. Sohrab? Good, if it's Sohrab, that's fine! Mr. Mogadam, enrol this boy. For information on the classes, the timetable, and so forth... Mr. Nahid will explain everything. Thank you. Good day, Professor! Good, good... Excuse me... You, don't go away. He only has this much for the registration fee. Impossible! That's all he has? Go back home. Not you, Professor! Come back with the full amount, and we'll enrol you. I will guarantee his fees, please don't worry. Mr. Nahid, again? Do your best. Consider it done. That's that. - Name? - Sohrab. Not at all, you're at home here. About what? Yes... No, no, it's not possible. Not at all. You know full well. You're perfectly correct... but it just isn't possible! Not at all. Goodbye, Professor. - Goodbye. - Sohrab, you've forgotten your things. - So how did you find your first day? - Great. Can I come every day? No, the rest of the week is for the tar... the santor, the piano. - Goodbye, till Monday. - Goodbye. Sohrab, next time, you must play on your own nay. - Tell your father to buy you one. - My father? Anyway, you'll need one. Goodbye. Sohrab, what are you doing here? This class is for girls. Havert you gone yet? You're going to be late. Yes, Professor. How beautiful it is! You want to learn the daf, too? It's called a daf? Where have you been? You've never heard a daf? I'm late, goodbye! Poor child, he's crazy! Darling, why have you gone to all this trouble? You spend your time sewing. I want to be useful too. If I sew, it's for you, my child. Thank you very much. If I don't pay in full, I can't keep going. - What I gave you wasrt enough? - No, I'm sorry. If it hadrt been for Mr. Nahid, they wouldn't have admitted me. I need a tape recorder. - What for? - I'll explain to you later. - I never understand what you're up to! - I have to find one! We'll see. I'll ask the neighbours. Your father was looking for you. He's asked twice where you were. He has gone to pray. He wants you to join him there. He left you a little money. I told him you had your homework to do. Do you know what a daf is? Ali, go and find a candle. When are things ever going to change? The roar of waterfalls, the drip of water in caves... the singing of birds, the wind in the roses... all this is rhythm and music. Moreover, we read in Genesis... that when the soul desired to enter Adam's body... she needed an intermediary. Music was that intermediary. But where is your nay? Next time, you'll need one. Right, students, you are all at different levels... but now, we're going to do a special exercise. I will play a piece, you will take it up... then we will play together. Azar, Azar! Stop! What are you doing here, young man? Can't you see this is a class for girls? And you, Azar, why are you laughing? Sohrab, you're in here again! Go before you're expelled. I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself. Forgive him, he couldn't help himself. Of course, he couldn't help himself. So, where were we? Turn it down, young man! Better still, turn it off! Driver, say something to him! What's the problem? He's listening to music. What's the matter? - He should stop that noise. It's a sin! - He's listening to music, so what? We liked it! My God! Stop! Stop. So, are you lost again? No, I came to apologize. Last time, I took your nay without asking. Now you know how to play. Give it back to me. I'm ashamed. It's a long story. First listen to what I recorded. So, that's how it is? What a story, Ali... Sohrab! Your father is surely a good man. I'm certain that he loves you. Try to love him, too. How can you love someone if you're always afraid of him? Don't be afraid. What will you do now? I came to borrow your nay. A nay is never loaned. - I still owe...? - No. Here, my gift to you. But take care of it. It has a soul. You must look after it like a living creature. Thanks very much. Really. O Saint, on the severed head of Imam Hossein... I didn't want it to end like this! I brought him here to pray every day. You know how much I loved him. He was my son, my very heart. I never wanted things to end like this. What should I have done? He came home late at night. He said he'd say his prayers... but he was lying. By God, I knew he was lying! I told him to say his prayers in front of me. He wasrt following the righteous path. He was straying further and further. He was growing up, I could no longer control him. Intercede for me before the Prophet! Ali, my child! Ali, my child! Imam Ali, help me! You know my name. What are you called? Al... Sohrab. Sohrab? But where's Rostam? Rostam? If Sohrab had worn a spotted shirt... Rostam, his father, would not have killed him! Forget it, I'm joking. It's so lovely! It's a timbur. You know it comes from Kurdistan? No. The timbur, the daf, the nay... How magical! Each instrument comes from a different region of Iran. At the end of the year, there's a concert. The best students play. Really? From every class? Yes. From yours, and from mine. What are you doing? Where are you going? I'm going to be the best! You too! Thank you! He's crazy! Look at him! Have you seen that film? Film? Have you been to the cinema yet? Cinema? No. Would you like us to go? Do they play the daf and the nay? No. Hello. How is it going? I can't make it this evening. The signal's really bad. To be honest, I didn't want to go. - Azar, darling! - I'm coming. Thank you very much. - Thank you very much. - Don't mention it. Darling, serve your guest, then both come to eat. No thanks, I have to get back. Out of the question. When Azar told me you were coming, I made dinner. Thanks, but it's a long way, and my mother will worry. You've got time. Can I show Sohrab the photos? You're the mistress of the house, my darling. The mistress...! I went to France with my father. We took these pictures on the beach. Come here. I'll show you. Here, I was just one. I could barely walk. They let go of my hand here. Look at my face in that one! We buried my grandfather. May his soul be at peace! The daf has become a martyr. My uncle played the daf at my grandfather's funeral. My love for it was born at that moment. My grandfather also played it. Only my father didn't. - Is that you there? - Sure, when I was an angel. - Have you never seen an angel? - No. I don't believe in them. But if one existed, it would look like my mother. My father finished his thesis at the Sorbonne. It was about angels in ancient Persian... and Western literature. One day, he told me what angels are made of. Each is made of a different substance. Some of earth, others of water, or fire... Satan was a fire angel. He was the wisest and most intelligent... but he burnt his wings, became smoke and rose to Heaven. But angels' wings don't burn! It's your father. He's calling from Paris. Daddy! It's a beautiful photo! Wait, wait... Do you want it, as a keepsake? Pass me a pen. When I saw the photo of the half-naked girl in his pocket... a fire swept through me! I couldn't stand it any more! I threw it into the oven. I watched it burn for a long time. It burned... it burned... My son, what sin! O Saint, tell me! What sin have I committed? I always brought him here to worship. He said his prayers on time, close to you. Tell me, what have I failed to do for him? I should have asked you for a daughter. May I be damned! It's my fault. No! It's his mother's fault. It was she who wanted a son. She said the firstborn should be a boy. But, of course, you know everything. I too longed for a son. Ever since, you have given us nothing more. Ali, my son... Ali, my son... Ali, my son... Imam Ali, what should I do? The Devil be damned! Ali! Ali, darling! Stop, he's coming! Bastard! If I catch you, I'll rip you to pieces! You're profaning my house! What is this? Don't beat him, he'll listen! He won't play it again! - Idiot! - Don't beat him! Ali! Hossein! O lmam Ali... O lmam Ali... At the last moment lmam Hossein Asked Shemr, his assassin Not to unsheathe his sabre Bastard! Answer me! Before you, I knew peace! Ali! Ali! Hossein, where were you? I looked for you all night, you and Ali. Where is Ali? Why don't you answer? Ali? Ali? Ali! Ali! - What have you done to my child? - Don't cry, wife. What have you done to my child? I didn't understand what was happening. I was beside myself. I was beside myself. No. My child cannot be dead! No! It's not possible! The loved one has found the righteous path once more May it be thus for eternity His heresy has been transformed into faith May it be thus for eternity Night has melted away The dawn has come Sorrow has vanished victory is here The sun shines throughout May it be thus for eternity The ignorant and hideous monster Has been made beautiful like Joseph of Canaan May it be thus for eternity Silence! I am drunk with love! My heart is no longer mine And I lose my mind May it be thus for eternity The feast day is here! The beloved Once fled, has returned And gifts abound May it be thus for eternity The loved one has found the righteous path once more May it be thus for eternity CAPTIONS BY VIDEOLAR
