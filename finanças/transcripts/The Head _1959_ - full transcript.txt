SATAN'S NAKED SLAVEGIRL Who‘s there? It's me. Sister Irene. Good evening, Walter. - Good evening, Irene. Here are the X-ray photos that Professor Abel asked for. You look completely worn out. What's wrong with you? The Professor seems to be a tyrant. No. He's a genius and it's really a pleasure to work with him. But he‘s now beginning some experiments that, in my opinion... ...exceed certain ethical limits. - What do you mean by that? Irene, you know me. You know that I'm not what you might call a very religious man. Not religious, no. But now I'm starting to question certain things. Does man have the right to reveal certain secrets of nature? I don‘t know. I am completely in despair. Walter, has the Professor spoken to you? About what? - About me. He examined me two weeks ago, and don't know Oh, I'm sorry! I really don't know what‘s wrong with me. Yes, yes. He's very satisfied with his findings... ...and he is convinced an operation can be successful. But, Irene, you know my concerns. I have full confidence in the Professor. My God, I'm so happy! Just the thought of walking through the city again... ...and nobody's going to stare at me. On the contrary, I think that men are certainly going to look at you. Walter, where are you then? I need you. The Professor's calling me. I'll be over to see you soon, we'll talk about it then. Goodbye, Irene. - Goodbye, Walter. Excuse me, Sister. I‘m looking for the house of Professor Abel. Yes, that's here. Who‘s there? Dr Ood, at the recommendation from Professor Hartmann. Good day, Dr. Ood. - Good day, Professor. Allow me to introduce Dr. Burke, my assistant. A first class surgeon and an excellent architect. He was responsible for the alterations of the house. That is Bert Jaeger, an engineer of genius. He built all my special operating machines. It permits me to work without assistants. He's a little bit strange. The result of a brain operation. But he's a good and faithful colleague. Yes, that's how we live here Where do you actually come from? I don't know, Professor. I was found alone... ...in a shipwreck in the Mediterranean. I was a few months old. Where does your name come from then? That was the name of the wrecked ship, Ood. Dr. Hartmann has recommended you highly. Why do you wish to work with me? | have followed your recent experiments with special interest. Especially that in which you succeeded in removing the head... ...from a dog's body and keeping it alive for 4 months. But the Russians performed that experiment months before I did. We base all our experiments essentially... ...on the hypothermia of the temperature of the living being. I'm particularly interested in the crafting... ...of healthy organs to replace diseased ones. That is a field in which I‘m extremely interested. So then you are exactly right here. This is my operating room. Here you will find everything you need. Electrocardiograph, electrocephalograph. And these these are my silent assistants, controlled by Bert Jaeger. And up there that is my Serum Z. With this serum I'm able to keep an organ alive after separating it from its body. Fantastic! Why did you keep this sensational discovery secret until now, Professor? Do you think it's so important? I‘m not an ambitious man. What's important for me is the progress of science. Yes, that was the device for the dog's head. Theoretically, one should be able to repeat the experiment with a man's head. But that's absurd, I would never have thought of such a thing. I said "theoretically", Professor. Yes, you're perfectly right. Theoretically everything's possible. Thanks to the advances of modern surgery and my development of Serum Z it‘s... ...possible to consider operations which would until recently have been unthinkable. When you can move in with us? - If you wish, Professor, already tomorrow. Good. Walter, leave us alone. Bert. - Yes? What do you think of the new man? I don't know. But the Professor needs him. Dr. Ood. Do forgive me, but I must call your attention to a most important fact. The Professor has a weak heart. A very weak heart. I value him very much. Any excitement could be life threatening I have come here to work! Good evening. Apparently you enjoy undressing in front of those Iowlifes. Maybe you can offer me something better than... ...standing around naked and freezing for hours as your model. I am not forcing you to do it. ljust don't like seeing you undressed in front of others. Aha! His nibs isjustjealous. We could live like millionaires! If your father, councilor Lerner would finally insist that... ...you finish your law exams and give up sculpting. Your pictures Nobody will buy them anyway. Shut your mouth! You make me sick. I make you sick? You think I need you? Miss Lilly, you‘re on. - Yes, I'm coming now. I make you sick? - Quickly, Miss Lilly, come quickly. Just wait. THE NUDE AND SATAN A martini, please, Franz. One very special martini for Miss Lilly. And a whiskey for you, Paul, right? Come on, let's make up again, Lilly. Oh, leave me alone! I thought I made you sick? We say a lot of things when we're mad. Another martini, please, Franz. Lilly, don't drink so much. - Another one, Franz, please. Don't be angry. Get off me. Always your same old tricks. I‘m sorry. Will you please examine these two X-ray plates. They come from two different patients. One photo is of an old man's heart, the other the spinal column of a young man. Fracture of the vertebral column, with partial rupture of the spinal cord. I see no possibility of a surgical intervention. Who is the man? - Unidentified. Traffic accident. He hasn't long to live. And you, Dr. Ood? Cardiac aneurysm at an advanced stage. Possible rupture of the artery in a very short time. Incurable? We could try... ...to give this man here a new heart. For example the heart of that man. Exactly. We're going to perform this operation. Because this is a photo of my own heart. But Professor! I'm so sorry, but but you can't do that so easily. No discussion, gentlemen. I have no time to wait, and neither does he. Come over here. I‘ve worked out exactly how we shall proceed. The first phase Walter. Here's the medical record. I'm afraid he is a hopeless case. I know, but we're going to try anyway. - Is something the matter with you? Nothing. See you later, Irene. - See you later. Burke, have you examined his heart? Yes, I did, Professor, it is all right. Good. Bert! Listen very carefully to what I say. We will now begin with... ...a very important operation. And it will be very complicated. You must do whatever Dr. Ood tells you, understand? Even if what you do seems very strange. Promise me that. Yes, I promise. - Good, my boy. So, gentlemen, shall we begin? It's now 9:47. We operate in 12 hours. Two hours from now we shall examine both again. I‘ll do that. Dr. Ood! Dr. Ood! Come, quickly! Quick! The man is dead! What are you doing? - I'm going to cover the body. Why? - Because the operation is impossible now! I‘ve told you that the man‘s already dead. What are you doing there? - We'll operate anyway. But how? Are you out of your mind? We have one chance to save the Professor's life, and we will definitely try it! You mean giving the Professor the dead man's heart? I won't let you do it! Get out! I will now call the hospital, so they can pick up the body. Good morning. - Dr. Burke has disappeared! All his things are gone too. - I know. He left last night, he had a nervous breakdown. We shall have to go ahead without him. Bert We must save the Professor's life. Ready? Scalpel. Tampon. Clamps. Clamps. Ventricular fibrillation! Respiration weakening. Respiration has stopped! Death. Serum Z! Oh, no! You should not get upset. Can you understand me? - Yes. I'll give you the facts first. The man whose heart we‘d planned to use died before we could operate. Dr. Burke lost his nerve and ran out on us. I took the heart of the dead man and grafted it in place of yours. Nevertheless your death was inevitable. That left me only one last chance! And that was to repeat the experiment with the dog's head with you! And it succeeded. You have survived your own death. What kind of devil are you, Ood? Do you want to present me as a freak at the fair? You're capable of it. Kill me! No, Professor, you will live. You are a great scientist. And you have to admit that I have succeeded... ...in preserving the only valuable thing about man, the brain. Your brain. So you will continue to be useful for science. You're not human. Are you insane to demand that? Did you have permission from me for this operation? Did you ask the dog‘s permission before you operated? But I had to make this experiment after all, you know that as well as I do. Kill me, Ood. Do you want to call that life? You think! And so, you will live. Yes, perhaps that's right. I don‘t know anymore. Everything becomes blurred. I‘m tired. Let me sleep Must sleep I shall increase the oxygen supply. Is he still alive? - Yes. You may see him. Yes? No, Dr. Burke's not here. Hello? Who's speaking please? No, Miss Sander, we still haven't heard from him. Why do you care? - I haven't heard from him for so long. Yes. Have the police been notified? Yes, of course the police have been notified. I know, at the Santa Maria Hospital. Goodbye. Police? Yes, I wish to report a missing person. All right. Who's speaking please? Dr. Ood. Dr. Walter Burke. Karlstrasse 1. Around 40. One meter eighty-two. Particular identifying marks? None. Since two weeks. Good, we'll see what we can do. One second, please. Hey, weren‘t you just talking about a doctor? This is about a doctor who's... ...disappeared for two weeks. Maybe it is the same doctor? Give it to me. Hello, I'm Inspector Sturm. Who's on the line? Dr. Ood? Another doctor. No, I mean we have another doctor here... ...who would like to talk to you. I understand. I‘ll be there in an hour. As I said, he would like to talk to you... ...but unfortunately he is not able to do so. For a very simple reason. He hasn't got a head anymore. Not a very pretty sight, huh? Looks like he might have got caught in a ship's propeller. But you're a doctor, you must be used to this sort of thing. Yes. But that's not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is about 40 years old. That is the body of an old man. Do you recognise that, maybe? That's the only thing we found on the body. It was the only way we could tell that he was a doctor. A medical school symbol. But I‘ve never seen this ring. I'm sorry. I put you in twilight sleep for a while. It's you again, Ood? So it wasn‘t a dream. Tell me how you feel about your new form of life. I want to evaluate it scientifically. Have you lost your human emotions completely? Just like a heartless robot. - Don't be so utterly childish, Abel! Concentrate hard now. You must tell me the formula for Serum Z. I can't find it in your papers anywhere. I won't give it to anyone. It's here in my head. You will not get it. Irene Sander? I'd like to introduce myself. Dr. God, the new assistant to the Professor. You you've come because of your cousin. I'm very sorry, but we've still had no news from him. Were you here when he left? - Yes. During some recent experiments we were conducting with Professor Abel... ...his state of nervousness has worsened more and more. He was particularly agitated the day before his disappearance... ...and he always spoke of his moral dilemma and of God. He must have lost his nerve and simply fled. That is possible. Yes, he talked to me a lot about his scruples lately. My God! Irene. Everything will be fine. Dr. Burke told me about the problem you have... ...and Prof. Abel shares my opinion. I have often performed such operations successfully. I will operate on you. No. No. - Why are you afraid? Irene, you want an operation, don‘t you? Just think a minute how wonderful it's going to be... ...when your lovely face has a normal and beautiful young body to go with it. No. Ng- You know what the man said to me? "Miss Lilly," he said, "You are so lovely". "So lovely that you could perform on the most famous stages in Europe." And he spoke about some very interesting engagements. Yeah, I saw him. Looks like he is a white slave trader. That's just exactly what you need. Do you think you're the only man for me? Another whiskey, Franz. - No! Another whiskey, Franz, that man has nothing to say. A whiskey, or I‘m gonna wreck this joint! Lilly, you're drunk. Me, drunk? I never get drunk. I can even stand with one leg on a chair. You want me to prove it? Sorry, Mister, I didn't mean to. - Too bad. See, he's a gentleman, not like you. Would you dance with me? — Sure, with pleasure. Are you an undertaker? Why? - You hold me like I was dead. Is that better? - Much better. Don't you think so? Did you know that I am a professional dancer? Yes, I do know. - How? Don't you recognise me, Stella? You impossible. Everything is possible. - Dr. Brandt? Now, please, Dr. Ood. Just as you are now Lilly. But I would never have recognized you, you're so changed! The gray hair and Yes, my illness caused it. Blonde hair suits you very well. I recognized you right away. I suppose you‘ll turn me in now. You poisoned your husband. And as a result of an experiment I have a man's life on my conscience. They have enough evidence against both of us. You mean you're still doing those awful experiments? I'm legally a doctor here. And you're a striptease dancer. I only work here because I earn money more easily. I‘ve got to drink something. One martini for Miss Lilly. — Make it a double, Franz. Stirred? Exactly. Sadly, I must go now. But I‘ll be back. Concentrate very hard now, Professor. Can you recall all the details of Nurse Sander's illness? The vertebral column. - Correct. I have studied her case thoroughly and decided to operate on her. My preparations are completed. I have come up with a brilliant solution. - What do you want to do with her? I will give her a new, perfectly formed body. Are you insane? You have already turned me into a monster, isn‘t that enough? I will perform the same operation which you had already planned. I want to operate on Irene tomorrow. Unfortunately she does not want to be treated by me, she only trusts you. I need your help. You must speak to her. I don't want the girl to see me like this. You must at least spare me that. She doesn't have to see you. She need only hear your voice. Tell her you're very busy, and that she can trust me. Iwill, if you give me your word that you... ...will not perform any experiments on Irene. You have nothing to fear. Your cousin has written to us. May I please see the letter? Professor Abel has the letter, but I've read it. Your cousin is somewhere in Austria. Unfortunately, he didn't give his exact address... ...but he seems to have recovered very well. He expects to return within a few weeks. Is there any message for me? - Yes. He asked Professor Abel to operate on you as quickly as possible. But I don't understand, he was against the operation the last time we spoke. And now all of a sudden — Yes, certainly. He wrote me that after careful consideration... ...he agreed with the Professor's opinion. Can I talk to the Professor? Professor Abel, Irene Sander is here and wishes to speak with you. Irene. - Good evening, Professor. Irene, I can‘t see you personally right now. If you agree to the operation, it can be performed tonight. I have to leave soon on a long trip. You can arrange the details with Dr. Ood. This evening? Professor Abel had a very precise plan. If you agree, Irene, Iwill immediately start with the preparations. But I must tell my landlady, and let the hospital know You can leave all that to me and Bert. Go and rest now, Bert's fixed your room. We've got a lot do do before the operation. This evening there's nobody in the place who wants his portrait done. We can still talk to the city councilor No, tomorrow I will meet at least one customer... ...who wants me to design a tombstone for his wife. You see, someone always has to die before you can live. Very good, Lilly. You really are a born philosopher. Philosophy, my ass. What is it that's troubling you? You're drinking entirely too much. Lately you've changed completely. - I'm so sick of everything! This town, and these men out there I hate this lousy life! I wanna get out of here! Who‘s there? Do you need me any longer? Why? - Because I want to know. Am I interrupting? - Yes, that‘s right. You mean I should leave you with this fella, is that it? This is my dressing room, now get out of here! All right I am leaving. But I‘m sorry for you. What do you want from me? Why did you come back? I'm afraid of you. Why's that, Stella? Back then I changed your face through an operation and saved your life. Why are you afraid of me now? - I don't know, I don't know. It‘s It is as if the past has suddenly come alive again! Forget that now. Come on, we‘ll have some fun. That's a real good idea, this is what I need now, I want to dance... ...and I want excitement, music and people around me. Stop! Don't move for a moment. - Why? You still have a beautiful body. Gosh, it‘s really chic here! I never expected this from this old house. Did you adapt the house all by yourself? My predecessor had amused himself with it. Dead things don't interest me. It's living things that fascinate me. Do you suddenly like me? I‘d really like something to drink. So you inherited all this? Not yet. Are you alone in the house? - Not exactly. What's that then? — An invention of mine. It‘s not poisoned, I hope. - That's not my specialty. Not bad! - You will sleep well after that. But I'm not ready to go to sleep. I‘m wide awake! Miss Sander? Please come to the hall downstairs. Who is this woman? - A patient. She had a nervous breakdown. I've given her a sedative. She'll fall asleep soon. Sleep, that's a good idea. Undress myself Also a good idea. She's a dancer. She has a fabulous body, doesn‘t she? Will you expose your left arm please, Irene? Don't be afraid. Think only of a body, as beautiful as that woman‘s. I want you to follow my operation, Abel. Scalpel. - No. Scalpel! Come in here, Irene. I I‘d like to see the Professor. Idon't know I've I‘ve a strange kind of feeling. As if my body did not belong to me. Like he‘s not doing what I want anymore. Why did you put this on me? This consolidates the position of the spinal column. I think we'll be able to remove it in a week or two. Sit down. The first cigarette tastes good, doesn't it? But I've never smoked before. You‘ll find that many things will be changed in your life. How is that ...? My hands They are completely different. There, the nail It was broken, and now Suddenly it's back there again. — Irene. You've gone through a huge transformation. Your glands were regenerated first. 117 days you were kept in a state of twilight sleep. And during that time, I changed many organs and performed plastic operations. My feet now they're much smaller. My shoes will be too big for me now. You have very lovely legs, Irene. Can I have my clothes back, please? Don't worry about it, we'll get you some new ones tomorrow. But I can‘t stay like this! - Why not? Don't be afraid. I operated on you in such a way as to leave no marks on your lovely body. You are so beautiful now. You don't need to hide from people. Why are you fighting your feelings? You can't run away from yourself! Irene, open up. Don't act like a child, you need rest. What's wrong? All right, I'll go away. You can come out then. Miss Irene! Come in, come in! Why did you disappear without telling me a word? The hospital‘s called me many times to ask for you, but I hadn't heard a word Oh, Iforgot, some strange man called and said you were going to leave for a trip... ...and would be gone for 3 months. I was going to call the police! What is that? That's amazing! It's a miracle! What happened to you, Miss Irene? You've got so beautiful. I was operated on. It‘s wonderful. Wonderful! Come to my room, and tell me all about it. No, no. I'm terribly tired, I must get some rest. Yes, yes, of course, my clear, of course. Good night. - Good night. Good night. I‘m not a cripple anymore. But... What is wrong with me? Way too big! Lilly Is it that dancer? Excuse me. For a moment, I thought you were someone I knew. Is this your first time here? - Yes. Actually I‘m looking for someone, a dancer who, I was told, works here. Who, if I may ask? - Lilly. You can't see her anymore. She's been dead for three months. What? But how did that happen? She was found on the railroad tracks, her body mangled by the wheels of a train. Did you know her, then? - I met her once, briefly. That's weird. The woman you remind me of is Lilly. How strange. Same figure, the same dress. Did you know her well? She was my model for a while. I'm a sculptor. My name is Paul Lerner. Was she really that pretty? Well, she did have a wonderful body. But she wasn't as lovely as you. A whiskey, please. I meant a coffee, please. Shall we dance? I don't know. I've never danced in my life. Please, come with me. You dance beautifully. You must be a born dancer. It is odd. I wonder, where we could have met. Your face is one no one would forget. But when I close my eyes and feel your body moving... ...I'm sure we've met before. Always it's Lilly. - Yes. Do you have a picture of her? - A few sketches and a bust I did. If you ever visit me, then I will show you my work. And I'll make a bust of you too, if you allow. Fine, I'd love to come. Come in. I was afraid you wouldn't come. I promised, didn‘t I? - Take off your coat. Did you make all of these? - Yes. That's Lilly? - Yes. And who would that be? - That is supposed to be you. I‘d like you to model for me. I ask for nothing bad, ljust want you to open your blouse a little. I want to make a torso of you. Fine. - Sit down over on the stool. That's curious - What? That beauty mark. - What beauty mark? There, it has a very particular shape. Lilly had the same. Who‘s there? - Irene. Just before my surgery, I saw a woman here. What have you done with her? A woman? Certainly a patient I have treated. I haven't seen her since. The next day her body was discovered, run over by a train. It was the dancer Lilly. You killed her! And now you think I'm a murderer? - Yes, I know what I‘m saying! I found this woman‘s clothes in the cellar. And her handbag! What kind of witchcraft did you practice on me? You grafted her skin on my body! You don't have enough imagination. But if you really want to know, Iwill tell you. Ididn'tjust give you the skin of that woman I gave you her entire body! - No! No, that's impossible! - Impossible? Come with me! - Leave me alone! I just want to show you that anything is possible! No... So he really did it. Fantastic. It's incredible. It's a miracle that you are alive. I beg you, Irene, don't look at me. I‘m happy about your success. You now have a normal body. So this body isn‘t my body? - Now it is. But I can't live this way. - You will live. You see, Abel, she's still headstrong. I am curious if this body will end up... ...influencing her mind with its desires after all. Don't listen to God! Go, go away. And don‘t ever come back. But before you go, l have something to tell you. Come closer. Tear off the tubes so I can die! - Get back! You'll go on living, Abel, as long as I want you to. I‘ve had Serum Z analyzed, and I now know the formula. The first time I saw you... ...the wonderful clarity of your face fascinated me. It was then that I decided to give you a new body. My operation on Professor Abel convinced me that maybe... ...I could repeat the experiment on you. You are my creation. Bert, is that you? Help me, he has locked me in here. Come, quick! He‘s in the laboratory. Thank God. I knew you would help me, Bert. Taxi! Taxi! Who's there? - Irene! Open up quick! Paul, please, look it, quick! He‘s downstairs! - Who? Dr. Ood! Calm down, Irene. Come on. Drink this. This will do you good. There's no one out there. Lie down for a while inside. Paul, you must help me. I don't know what I should do. I. I think I'm losing my mind. Please try to be calm, Irene. Everything will be all right again. Now, first of all, tell me what the problem is. It's all so crazy, so incredible. I used to be a cripple I was hunchbacked. That's true! Ask the hospital where I worked, or the old woman I'm living with now. It's true, can you believe me? - I believe it, yes. Then I was operated on, and that was 3 months ago. When the operation was over, I hid in the basement, I was so scared! Hid from whom? - From Dr. Ood. He operated on me. And in the cellar, Ifound Lilly's clothes and handbag. He has killed her! And This is her body. My head and her body. But Irene, it's impossible, calm down. - Yes, it's true! And it was my own body that they found on the railroad tracks. It must seem completely implausible to you. I myself do not understand how such a thing is possible. Today I went to 00d and told him to his face that he had killed Lilly... ...and he didn‘t even deny it. And then he showed me something horrible. I saw the head of Professor Abel. Only the head! And this head was alive. And it spoke to me. Irene. - There. Paul, do you hear? Don‘t let him in! Who's there? — I wish to speak to Irene. Go away, or I'll call the police. He‘s gone. Tell me about Lilly. - Why? You loved her. - What does love mean? Love is something completely different. I think the sculptor in me loved her. And who loved especially her body. Which is my past anyway? The past of my body, or that of my head? Paul, I'm afraid! Have no fear. Now that your body is normal and so beautiful... ...all your natural feelings come out. You have no need to feel ashamed. Don't fight against it. - You're so good to me. Your face is so immaculate. Your eyes your mouth. Irene, quick, call the neighbors! It's me. Bert. Bert Where's Ood? - He‘s gone out. Bert, tear out the tubes. I want to die. He killed Burke, and then he buried him out in the park. He‘s completely insane. You must undertake something. He‘s coming! You really prefer that sculptor to me, do you? What an insanity. Who is that man anyway? I know you‘ve told him everything. But you can relax He will forget everything tonight. Yes, I am sick, I know. And you're the first to see it, but I don‘t care. You belong to me, me, me alone! Professor Hartmann has altered my glands. The results were fantastic. I became a genius. Yes! A genius! I also have these seizures since that time. Again and again these attacks. Especially in such weather. That moon And that wind. And that confounded dog! Three long months I have sacrificed for you. For three months I didn't leave your side, day and night. I fought against death. One operation followed the other. Thousands of blood vessels, nerves, glands, muscles... ...they all had to be treated and made to function as they did before! I stood at the operating table for 36 hours. And I have accomplished it. Now you are perfect. I'm not holding you here. When you want, you can leave. You are free, but you can't go. You belong to me. Only me. Irene! Irene! Franz, do you recall one night, about three months back? I was here with Lilly. - You were here every night with Lilly. Yes, but remember how she left one night with a man with bushy eyebrows? Yes, I think I remember now. Yes, he paid for her martini. Do you remember seeing him again? - No, I don't think so. Jeez, you mean that guy there? - Yes, that's him. Good evening. - Good evening. A martini, please. Tell me, does Miss Lilly still work here? Miss Lilly? Haven't you heard then? She was found dead, more than three months ago. On the railway embankment outside the town. - How awful. No, I‘m afraid I hadn‘t heard. I was away. Good evening, Doctor. Good evening. I‘m very sorry about her. May I buy you a drink? - Whiskey. So you were away, you say? Just when did you come back? I I‘vejust gotten back. Oh, I'm sorry, this is your glass. Where is Irene? — Who is Irene? You know quite well who I mean. Sister Irene Sander, what have you done with her? I don't understand you. You are lying! You kidnapped her tonight from my studio! Don't play games with me. I know all about you. Perhaps you would be so good as to tell me what you mean. I know that you killed Lilly! And I know you performed a disgusting operation on a Professor! What kind of disgusting operation then? - You cut his head off! Take it easy, you're sick. Murderer! You stay here, you dirty dog! You murderer! Call the police! You dirty dog! You murderer! Police! He's gone again. You're so afraid of him? Yes. I can't concentrate any longer. Bert ... Don't leave me alone. Here, drink this. It's just water. All right then, Mr. Lerner. Haven't we met before? Your face looks so familiar. Yes, we met once. It was about the death of the striptease artist Lilly. But now I know who murdered her. - What you don't say. And who is the mysterious murderer? - Dr. Ood. Dr. Ood? Another doctor? They are dangerous people, aren't they? - Yes, especially this one. Do you know what he did? - What? He cut off a Professor‘s head. What did he cut off? - A head! There was already someone without a head. - Who? The doctor. We have the body here in the morgue. What Now I'm completely confused. So am I. Anyway, who is this Dr. Ood? A maniac, believe me, a maniac! He murdered the dancer. And last night he kidnapped Miss Sander, and started a fire in my studio. I'm sure he's holding her prisoner in his house! You've got to do something fast! That is the son of city councillor Lerner. Are you the son of city councillor Lerner? Why didn't you tell us this earlier? I have decided to go away. I will destroy everything. I shall leave no clues behind. We'll go together, tomorrow morning. Call the police. But first get Irene to safety. There's a revolver in my desk, take it. Murderer! Murderer! You have to ruthlessly eliminate anyone who stands in your way. That's why I killed Burke. You killed me more than four months ago. But you will not have to wait much longer for your end either, Dr Ood. Mercilessly you have murdered. You are not a human being. Abel, you amuse me. You you use such grand terms. Humanity. Can you show me a single scientist who's working purely for humanity... ...and not just to satisfy his own curiosity? Without curiosity, there can be neither science nor progress. But you, Dr. Ood... ...you have misused your genius for criminal purposes. You, you, you you always talk about the others, but I I‘m much greater than the others, much greater! But you've disappointed me. I had hoped that the separation of the head... ...from the body would lead to new insights for you. A great spiritual clarity. I have failed. I have achieved a scientific miracle, but now the experiment is finished. You can die now. Whatever you start, Dr. Ood this will be your last experiment. I don't need a psychiatrist to tell me that you‘re completely mad. Shut up! I'm not mad! I am not mad! Yes, you are, Dr. Ood. You are mad. - No! No, no, no! Open up, it's the police! Where‘s Irene? Take care of this man. - Will do. Irene. Where's this Dr. Ood, then? I don‘t know. What's the matter, Irene? Nothing. - Come on. It's senseless, I'll never get away from him. Come, Irene. Now you're free of him.
