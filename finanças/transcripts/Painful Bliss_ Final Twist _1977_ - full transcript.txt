Every man looks shabby. I'm not anxious to do business with them. They stink. Bad. That's bad. - I'm bored with the con game. - Is that true? - It doesn't thrill us anymore. - Is that true? Don't talk so sassy. Midori... open up. And keep working hard. Eh? Mister... - Mister... I ran out of money. - What? If you want... Oh? This is your place? - I rent this room with my friend. - Ah? My doctor told me not to do this because of high blood pressure. Are you really a High school girl? How old? -17 - Oh? I'm cold. Bro... - It's showtime. - Yes. Hey, old man! How can I thank you for destroying my sister? Hey, old man! How can I thank you for destroying my sister...? And how are you going to fix the situation? All I hear is panting.

You killed this guy...I Now we can't get money from him. It's none of my business. He killed himself with sex. This bitch! Your bad attitude is caused by pleasant behavior! - What are you going to do? - What is that? You are not allowed to backtalk to me... ever. Eh? Understood? Understood? I want to hear the words. Midori! You bitch! Why do we now have to take care of this old man? Lift him. Quickly. Dig! Keep digging! Keep digging! Bury him. - Midori. - What now? Don't dick with me. Watch your mouth and clean up your attitude. Too snotty...! Show respect. Midori! I didn't like you from the beginning... ...cause of your bad attitude. But I've been nice... out of respect to my bro. Bitch! You bastard! Asshole! Are you attacking me, eh? - You two are awful. - What was that? Stop! All of you! The three of you, listen up! You guys need to know how to talk to your supervisors! Self important jerk! Bad attitude still continues! Unbelievable! Eh? How come you're so fucked up? Eh? Girls... be quiet and obey them. Midori... you still don't get it. You aren't in the position to give them commands. Is that understood? Understood!? Do you understand, girl? - I'm sorry. - All right with me. Listen girls... from now on, be careful who you catch. Unlike Midori... fish for fresh and healthy trout. - And hopefully rich. - Such a thing doesn't exist. What was that? What did you say? Do you need another lecture...? What a mouth against my bro! I meant to say "hard to find. " Are you still talking back to me... this is unbelievable. You will be sorry. Very sorry. This is unacceptable! Every delinquent must obey the rules... ...you must learn the most important rule, respect...I If you aren't careful we will sell you to a Hong Kong brothel. Then we wouldn't have to deal with your big mouths. Know what they do in Hong Kong? They scoop out your eyeballs. A prostitute doesn't need eyes! You think I'm kidding...? This really happens! It's not just a Chinese story! Do you understand? You must learn how to respect! Respect! Congratulations. It's good to have you back out of jail... Did you see him? My bro is related to the YAMASHITA Clan. I just talked to them about you girls. Don't even try to escape... you won't make it alive. Who was that guy? I don't know. He asked me for directions. I don't normally do this sort of things; It's not my style. I don't like to do this to you. But I must follow the orders from my bro. Girls... work hard! - She did it! - Good job, girl... Hey, Midori... you haven't done it! The other two girls did it. Why not you? Come on... Hold your tummy tight and push hard. Do it! Midori!... Hey... what are you doing to my sister? It's you... Everybody out of here. It's been a long time. You never come back to see me. I have never forgotten about you... not for one moment. Is that true? - Hey... close the door. - Yes. I should have tied you up and kept you in my apartment. Stop! Stop! Please! - Madam... watch him for me. - No problem. What a poor boy. I remember the days I had to do this kind of thing... ...with ropes and all. I can't believe it... you have a boner. I wanna have it too. Honey... Honey... I need it too. Come over here. Not yet... I need it sometime. Come over here. Not yet! Go away. Oh... you're disgusting. Swear to unconditional love forever Akemi... What now? A little bit. Little bit. Do me a favor. Can you shave my legs? - Do it yourself. Don't ask me. - What's wrong? - I am not your maid. - Shave my legs. Do it for me. When I ask nicely, you better do it... or this will happen. - Watch your mouth, bitch! - Not Don't! I need to see respect! Come over here! I want you to feel what I felt. Bitch! Is this what you want? What's going on here? She doesn't know how to talk to me. - That's enough. Come over here! - No way! I don't feel satisfied yet... Nobody pays attention to me anymore. Be more careful. Don't move. Damn it... I can't calculate. It's too difficult for a High school dropout - Akemi... did you graduate? - Yes I did. Toshi... where did you go to school? - Me? Tokyo University. - Tokyo University? Which one? The one in Tokyo. - Hey girls... you two can go home. - Work hard. Do your best. Good job. Midori... keep trying... Midori... This time... try it without my stick... You did it! Midori! You did it...! Thank you. Thank you very much. Good evening. Sorry I'm late. Ah... madam. Here. Good girls... honesty is very important for any business. Betraying your own team is the worst offense. Let's go. - Hey... why don't you come with me. - What are we going to do? What do men and women usually do together? - Madam... no way. - Don't say no. Yoshiko. But madam... are you sure you can do this? Rude girl. Come... take a good luck. See how big. You're right. - You have a great dick. - Yes. Now I'm embarrassed. I showed you mine... so now it's your tum to show yours. No way. What? You don't even have pubic hair yet! Maybe I'm a late bloomer. Honestly, I haven't experienced the pleasure yet. - You feel nothing? - Well, it feels ticklish. But I don't think it's the right feeling. Something wrong with you. When my boyfriend touches me, I feel very hot. You're so lucky. You may be a lesbian. Perhaps that's it. Maybe you are right. So how can I cure this? Stupid. It's not something that needs curing. Just pretend I'm a woman and see what happens, eh...? Then you'll have the feeling. Hey... call me "sister. " Sister... No good... try one more time. Do It again. Sister. Convey your feelings. - Sister! - Again. - Sister! - Try it again. Sister. Better. Sister...! Move! Here you two are. Shooting shit? Come with me. Honey. - Listen. - What? I was wondering why our business is down. I found her... not working. That's no good. She still thinks she's a delinquent. Some bad girls like you need constant punishment. No. No, don't. Your supervision is not adequate. Bro... there's a reason for this. I don't like excuses. Midori... straighten out your work ethic. Or I will sell you to a bathhouse. Bro... please listen to me. - Can we go into the other room? - Shut up! We are equipped with everything... candle, rope, whip and this... Stop! I don't like this! Quiet! Be quiet...I Midori... Midori...! I can't be patient any longer! Can't be patient? What are you talking about? I'm in love with Midori. We love each other. - Stupid! How old do you think you are? 297 I don't want to hear a 29 year old saying he's in love. Midori loves me too. Okay. Okay. I will give Midori to you. But only at night time... During the day she has to work her job as usual. Understand? I don't know if Midori wants to do that. If she wants?I It doesn't matter what she wants. You need to keep control over your woman. Smack her face if she doesn't want to work. You lied to me. You said I wouldn't have to work if I married you. You promised. What are you going to do about that? Shut up and do what I say! What are you doing to me? I told you I had a toothache and not to hit me! I don't like when somebody takes too long. Sorry. Just finish it quickly... Do your best... Hold my leg. Not like that. All right. All right... More. More... Hey. Hey. Hey Hey buddy... Hisae... who is this guy? Don't call me by name. He's my brother. - Yeah. - Hey buddy. You have a lot of nerve to fuck my sister. Look at your tattoo. Eh? What are you going to do to make things right...? I expect you to come up with something, eh? Tell me now! But... But... there's mutual consent. What's that? What'd you say? Tell me one more time! I'm saying we both agreed... between us. Hisae... Is that true? No. He forced himself on me. No. That's no answer! Maybe we should call the authorities. Then you'd be in lots of trouble... your tattoo won't help, eh. The best answer is monetary compensation. Huh? Who's that? Hisae... see who's there. -My ID - A cop! Kawasaki... you're under arrest for solicitation and extortion! - Move it... - Let me go! - Hisae...! You fucked up! - I didn't know! I didn't mean to stab him. I never imagined this could happen. This is not cool. This isn't the way it's supposed to go. Everything was going so well for me, Hisae. I was doing fine... using my brain... and penis. I was on my way to becoming a great Yakuza. I could've become the Godfather... boss of the entire Yakuza. Sshhh - Using my brain. - Wait. - Don't tell anybody what happened. -Right. Go. If you understand, then go. Where am I supposed to go? Anywhere. Ssshhh... Shoo. Shoo. Shoo... Who is it? I am HASEGAWA. HASEGAWA? Who are you? I wonder if you know Toshio Kitayama? Toshio? Ha... yes, Toshio is living here. Here? Yes, he's living here, but... Please come in. He's not here now. Where is he? I don't know. What time will he be back? Usually he's back by dark. Let me help you. Sorry but... could I wait for him? Want some tea? Don't worry about me. - It's been very chilly recently. - Yeah. What is the relationship between you and Toshio? A little complicated. That's for sure. What do you mean by complicated? It's none of your business. So shut up. Can I fix this situation with money? I'm confused by your words. Can you leave him? - Leave who? - Toshio, of course. Why are you laughing? I'm sorry. - Do you really want to see Toshio? -Sure I do. What? Stop! - Who bitch! - Who's a bitch? - You are! - Says who? I'm home. Akemi... who is your guest? Here is the lady who took Toshio Kitayama from you. Bad girl! You took somebody's boyfriend away...] Here is his fiance... What do you have to say? Kumiko... have a seat, dear. Toshio! Why are you dressed like this? - I wonder what you want from me. - Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Akemi... I brought a cake for us. I can't imagine what your father will say about this! The store in front of the station was having a sale. You are... so stupid! Eh? Shall we have some tea? And enjoy the cake. Kumiko... have some cake. You have some too. Can you tell my father... ...Toshio won't be back to the office forever. But... You bitch! Toshio is living happily in her new home. Now... Kumiko, I want to show you something. Take a good look. You don't have to run off. Kumiko... Kumiko... look at me. I thought you loved me! - Hey... wow, looks so pretty. - Don't touch, they're fresh. Akemi... Akemi! What's the rush? - We gotta go. Get ready. - But why? We're going on a rip. I am in trouble! What's wrong? What are you doing? Move, Akemi. - Hey, Akemi...I - Going on a trip? Shut your mouth up. I was just thinking about a trip... where are you going? You don't have to join us. Why do you say that? Can you zip it for me? Why not me? Quickly I don't like these spur-of-the-moment decisions. Why don't you take me too? If you came with us... you'd cause too much attention. That's not nice. - What is this? - Hey. You are too weird. Go away! - Honey... - Let's go. Hey... What am I supposed to do here? What should I do here? Shut up! Nobody cares about you! Wait! Asshole! You're a monster! Please. Don't leave me. Please! This is for you. Driver... time to go. Wait! Take me. I wanna go. Pull me. Please... Please take me...I Script: Rokuro Kumagaya Camera: Masahisa Himeda Art Director: Heihachiro Watanabe Asst.
