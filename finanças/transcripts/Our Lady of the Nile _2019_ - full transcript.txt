Grandmother said that when she died, her spirit would return to the volcanos, and her memory would dissolve into the lake. I can still hear her voice... Our Earth is tired, weary of the disorder left by the wandering colonists. Unaware of their destination, in search of their lost innocence. They conquered the world this way, by losing themselves. They went wherever they heard a child's laughter: the breath of peace. A mother's lullaby: the song of dignity. Bewildered, they came from all over. They came through the Land of a Thousand and One Hills, celebrating their ignorance. What arrogance! Can you tell me, did they find their lost innocence? Silence... I hear something... Don't you? Come, let me take you where ingenuous hearts once lived. Come on, girls, get up! I said get up! Wake up! Wake up. Godelive. Come on, wake up. Innocence You just let her, Modesta? She's crazy, that girl. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Bless this meal, Lord, and give bread to those who have none. Amen. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. You may sit. This afternoon will be devoted to our monthly tasks. Listen carefully for your group. I won't say it twice. Virginia. Goretti. Godelive. Gloriosa. You will dust and straighten up the archives. Frida. Veronica. Dorothée. Immaculée and Modesta. You will clean the statue by the river source. Louise. Rose. Odile. Jeanne. Natasha. Gisčle. You will plant vegetables with Brother Auxille. The Virgin that was unveiled resembled a Virgin from Lourdes, but she was different. Her face was black, her feet were black, and her hands were black. The Virgin is happy. I wish I had someone to wash me every morning! Maybe when you're old and ugly. Quiet, you're here to work. Dorothée, what did you do? She'd be prettier white. Modesta. - My God... - Give me some mud. For once, we had an African virgin. Rwandan like us, besides. Look who's coming. Him again? He's looking for a girl for sure. They say that he's... impotent. Mr. Fontenaille, we weren't expecting you. I came to pay my respects. Like you, I honor the mother of the Nile. Our statue. Mr. Fontenaille, please do not disturb the girls while they work. Yes, Sister. Of course. Thank you. Ladies... May the Virgin protect you. Hey, girls! Oh, how pretty! Look what I found. Show us. It's Veronica! It's beautiful. No way! Show me. Godelive, isn't this the inauguration of Our Lady? Yes. It's the ceremony. Too bad we weren't there. Hey girls, look. It's us when the Queen of Belgium visited the institute. She's beautiful. Yes. She's beautiful. But not as beautiful as the Tutsi queen Gicanda. Her beauty didn't keep her in power. You look awestruck by the queen anyhow. Who's that? Our former leaders, I think. Why are their faces crossed out? They're "on holiday." Otherwise, they'd have pillaged the country. Even the sugar. Gloriosa, wait. What do you want? I'm not a thief. The sugar... is for my little sisters. - There is none where I live. - It's not my problem. For the next math exam... I can help you. Frida's not back? She's sleeping over in the guesthouse with her fiancé, Jean-Baptiste Balimba, Ambassador of Zaire! He came from the capital to see her. Again? That's the second time this month. Yeah, I know. This is beautiful. Did you see? Veronica thinks she's a star! Hon, you're wrong. In this portrait, I'm not a star, I'm a goddess. Good Lord! Where'd she get it? - What? - The portrait. - It was Mr. Fontenaille... - The white man? Yes. It's a good drawing, isn't it? - Natasha, no! - "My love..." - Don't read it! - The institute is torture, I'm dying without you! Save me! Free me! Let's run away from here! I dream of living adventures with you, my love!" We'll see next year, ma'am. This year the institute has already reached it's 10% quota for Tutsis. Thank you, Reverend Mother. Thank you, Mother. I'm waiting. Virginia copied my work. No, it's Gloriosa... I want the truth. Virginia is a thief. She steals sugar from the refectory to sell it in her hills. Is that true, Virginia? Yes, Reverend Mother. I took a tiny bit of sugar, but not to sell. I will tolerate neither lies nor theft. When will you two stop quarreling? This is an institute for the elite. You are expected to become good citizens. And good Christians. The two go together. One more incident, and you'll both be severely punished. The sister-in-charge will see to you. Yes, Mother. You may go. Fontenaille Estate Coffee Plantation The white man scares me. He's crazy. Don't be stupid, Modesta. Come on. I'll wait out here. Then don't bother. I want to see Mr. Fontenaille. I want to see the white man who lives here. Follow me. Easy does it. That's good. Oh, what a nice surprise. What brings you to my humble home? I want a portrait like Veronica's. Veronica... - So that's her name? - Yes. With her long neck. Yes. Where is she from? I don't know. And her friend, with the tiny nose. What's her name? Virginia? Ah, Virginia. You, you're different. What's your name? Modesta. Who fears blood? Gods or men? Both, you might say. But if that's so, why do the gods demand it, and men offer it? Sacred Let us read from the Book of Genesis. "The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And from them came the people who were scattered over the whole earth. Noah, a man of the soil, proceeded to plant a vineyard. When he drank some of its wine, he became drunk and lay uncovered inside his tent. Ham saw his father naked and told his two brothers outside. Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it across their shoulders. Then they walked in backward and covered their father's naked body. Their faces were turned the other way so they would not see their father naked. When Noah awoke from his wine, he learned what his youngest son had done. He said: 'Cursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers.' Then he said: 'Praise be to the Lord.'" This is the word of God. The Lord be with you. May the Almighty bless you. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Go now, in the peace of Christ. Modesta, stop daydreaming, mass is over. Modesta! What's wrong with you? Thank heavens. It took you long enough. At last, you've become a woman. Come with me. Come in, child. The smell is bad, but you get used to it. You wash your sanitary towels here after each usage, with household soap. I see this surprises you. You will surely ask "how"? Gorillas and men have a common ancestor. I'm speaking from a scientific viewpoint, a hypothesis. The idea being that gorillas and humans made up one same species. We're from the same family as the great apes. My child, how dare you utter such lies? Mr. Decker told us. Mr. Decker... Yes. Goretti thinks it's just another white man's tale. Her mother said it's true, that gorillas were men before. But then, they fled into the forest. We don't know why, but they forgot how to be men. After years in the forest, they turned into hairy giants. But when they see a virgin girl, they remember they used to be men. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph! Is that the original sin you always talk about? My child... When men became apes? May Decker go to the devil. Have a good vacation, Goretti! - Hello, Modesta. - Ma'am. - Where's Dad? - He has lots of work. He was supposed to pick me up. You'll see him at the reception. - Welcome, madam. - Thank you. What a pleasure to see you. How is Mr. Minister, your husband? He's well. I must say hello to Mother Superior. Have a nice vacation, Mrs. Minister. You too, Mrs. Chief-of-Staff. Be good, Immaculée. Have a nice vacation. Bye, Modesta. Don't forget what Sister Gertrude said. You hairless ape. You're crazy, girl. Have a nice vacation you two. You too. Take care, Modesta. Thanks. What are you looking at? I can't be nice to your half-sisters? That's not it... I'm not like them. I'm different. There are the two cockroaches. You sound like your father! It's true, Mom. My cousins were turned away because of them. The two of them alone exceed the quota. Ask Modesta. We're sick of seeing them at the institute. I'm going to Fontenaille's. I want to thank him. Come with me. To his place? Are you crazy? You know what whites do to girls they lure into their home? They live out their fantasies. That's why I don't want to go alone. Please, come. I don't want to miss my bus. Pay no attention to that stuff. Those skins were for people I no longer see. I regret having killed these animals. That's the way it is. It's a world I don't like. Tell me... You're both Tutsi, right? That's what I thought. I love you. I want you to regain your dignity. Let me show you something. You've always been considered different from the Hutus. You weren't negroes. In olden times, you were aristocrats. You descend from a great ancient lineage. You come from the Empire of the Black Pharaohs. Your ancestors were chased away from everywhere. Everywhere. By the Christians, by the Muslims... And so, they exiled themselves here. At the source of the Nile. Don't leave. I have things to show you. Please. Come with me. The temple has waited too long for its goddess. Come, come. Everything here relates the Tutsi legend. Your legend. Your history. Today, I have one sole mission. Save the legend in order to save the Tutsis. I have a secret to reveal. The pyramid of the Black Pharaohs. I built it over the tomb of Queen Nyiramavugo. - A queen? - Yes. The great queen of ancient times. After months of excavation, I found the queen's bones. She was buried with pearls, pottery, and copper bracelets. I'm no archaeologist, and I didn't want it to end up behind glass in some Western museum. So I filled in the hole, and built the pyramid over it. Queen Nyiramavugo now has a tomb worthy of a Kandake queen. I have found Isis, and my Kandake, as beautiful as the first day. You are the legacy, and the legend. Fontenaille, he's an old pagan. He's not dangerous. He sees a film in his head, with goddesses and black pharaohs. He wants us to be his actresses. It could be fun. I've always wanted to be in a film. Not me. I don't want to play queen. Don't forget, Tutsis have already played in bad white films. Or more like, in their madness. And it brought our misfortune. Wait for me! Where do our tears come from? Why do they mist up our eyes? Some say they are the sap of our suffering, and our broken hearts. Others say our tears are the waters of innocence, to cleanse the Land of a Thousand and One Hills. Our Lady of the Nile Institute Girls! Look what my fiancé, the ambassador, brought me from France. - From France! - What is it? Foie gras. - What? - Foie gras. What's that? You're such peasants. Hey, we're not peasants! Switch on the light. What's going on? It smells funny. It looks like dirt. What animal is it? - I don't know, but it's delicious. - Delicious? - You want to taste? - No, thanks. Come on, it's from France! And so? And so, it's good! Come on, Immaculée. Come on, taste. It's very good. Okay, I'll taste. Can't be worse than caviar. - Than what? - Caviar. Fish eggs. I had it at the embassy. Fish eggs? You guys have to get used to this kind of food. What for? Especially you, dear Chief-of-Staff's daughter. At official dinners, you won't be eating beans and bananas. You'll eat white men's food. Modesta! It's squishy. It tastes like dirt. Because you know what dirt tastes like? In 16th-century France, the monarchy became scared when part of the nobility converted to Protestantism. Catherine de Medici encouraged the men of the Court to eliminate the Protestants. In the night of August 24th, 1572, Catholics massacred over 3,000 Protestants in Paris. Yes, Virginia? Is our history as bloody as Europe's? And why do we only talk about Western kings, never Rwandan ones? Rwanda is a republic now, forget about kings. Africa is Geography. Europe is History. Why? Africans can neither read nor write. What's wrong? Frida! Step back! She's fainted. She probably drank too much in nightclubs. She's been poisoned. There's too much jealousy here. - Frida, how are you? - Better, thanks. - Thank God. - And you? - We're fine. - How was class? You sure you're okay? I bet it was that foie gras. What do you mean? Mr. Decker said it comes from a big white bird. They force it to eat until it's sick. You ate so much of its sickness you almost died! I ate some too. Then you're going to die too. No one's going to die. Not at all. What is it then? I have a big announcement to make. Come closer. I'm pregnant. - For real? - Yes. Really? - What'd she say? - She's pregnant. But they're not married. Girls like her don't care. Will she get married? Who knows? She's always showing off with that ambassador of hers. I just know it's going to be a boy. A girl in our institute got pregnant before the Church celebrated her holy sacrament of marriage. We are as guilty as she. They're engaged, aren't they? It's a sin nonetheless, doctor. We're accountable for the virginity of our girls. You know what to do. I trust you. Since your vacation, I've heard girls speaking Kinyarwanda. Our code of conduct forbids the use of this language within the institute. Even if you are allowed to speak it elsewhere, I would urge you to continue using French even outside of the institute. I remind you that the rules of good conduct have not changed and must be respected. Our institute is devoted to educating the country's female elite. Those fortunate enough to be here must act as role models. You represent our institute throughout the country. Consequently, you must... in no way tarnish its reputation, be it inside, or outside the institute. Father. This is what the Lord Almighty says... The statue's nose isn't right. No dummy, I mean Our Lady of the Nile. Don't you see? She's got a small, minority nose. I don't like it one bit. Go on, shoo! Father, why didn't you take her to the hospital? We must pray for poor Frida. Now go back to class. I'm sure they lied to us. Frida didn't have a miscarriage. What killed her is that white food she loved eating so much. It's not fair. Frida didn't deserve to die. Nothing's fair in this world when you're a woman. Maybe the bird didn't kill her. Maybe her parents paid abarozis to poison the baby. Her own parents? Could be. Here, a pregnant girl can't get married. It's a disgrace. She could bring her family bad luck. They left her blood to rot and dry on the ground. Sacrilege Thank you. Come with me, my dear. It's time you learned the truth. Veronica, come back. I'm waiting for you. Veronica? Are you okay? Where were you? I looked everywhere. Goretti found you on the path to the institute. Veronica, what happened? I don't remember. I think... I was... at Fontenaille's. I can't remember. I told you not to go back there. I had to. But... ever since we saw the queen's tomb, she's come to me each night. Who? The queen. As clearly as I see you now. I had to tell Fontenaille. No. Get some rest. I'll tell the nuns you're ill. Do you know where Nyirimongi lives? - Nyirimongi, the witch? - Yes. - Take me to her. - No way. I'll give you fritters. - Really? - And a soda! - Orange soda? - And some fritters. Let me see. All right, I'll take you. You can have them when we get there. - What's your name? - Kabwa. Nyirimongi? Nyirimo... I came to ask for help. - Help? - Yes. The sun is shining on your face, I can see you well. What do you want? Not me. It's not for me. Then who? My friend Veronica. It all started after we visited the crazy old white man. He discovered the tomb of Queen Nyiramavugo on his land. He opened it. When he uncovered the queen's bones, he awoke her from death's slumber. Now her ghost wanders through our world. Her shadow must return to the land of the dead. If not, her ghost will continue to haunt your friend. The queen is in great suffering. She must be taken back to the land of the dead. If you do everything I tell you, your friend and the queen will be at peace once more. This will ward off the ghost and the white man. It will protect your friend from evil. This pot is carved from a flame tree. Fill it with milk from the white man's cow, not from any other cow. Do you understand? The person who milks the cow must be a strong warrior. Near the queen's tomb, you must gather leaves from the flame trees. Dip them into the milk. Then sprinkle the tree and say... Return without thorns, like the umurembe. For the remedy to work, the pot must never touch the ground. When the pot is empty, bury it among the tree's roots. Tell no one what you've done. - It's too high. - So? We can't get up there. Sure we can! I'll climb up on your shoulders. Lean over. Our Lady, you'll soon have a nice Rwandan nose. A majority nose. I'm coming down, catch me! Modesta! Unbutton me and go rinse my dress. Get up. We're going to be late. Sister Gertrude will punish us. I've got an idea. Stop. We'll say we got attacked by bandits. Tutsis. Get up. Hit me. We have to make it look believable. Hit me! If you want to be my friend, do as I say. Come on, hit me! You're a coward, unworthy of your Hutu blood. Cockroach! We should drain your Hutu blood. You don't deserve it, you're... We were praying at the statue of Our Lady of the Nile. Then some Inyenzis... at least 50 of them were hiding in the hills... ...attacked Modesta and me. Tutsis. They... hit us. They even ripped her dress... Come, my child. Modesta's dress... To rape her. I overheard them talking together. They plan to attack the institute. To rape and torture the students. The nuns too. Even the whites. May the Lord help us. I started screaming. They got scared and ran off like cowards. But before they fled, I recognized the voice of... Jean Bizimana. The son of Gatera. Come with me to the infirmary. The Tutsi who tends a stall at the market. Be strong, my child. - Father? - All's well. We're safe for now. Soldiers are guarding the institute. The girls may go back to bed. Girls, you may return to your dorms. Modesta, stop crying! We saved the institute. We're heroes! What's wrong with her? Get up. Come on. I'll help you get cleaned up. Don't worry, Modesta. I'm here. Is she okay? "On Sunday, May 13th... two glorious and modest heroes from Our Lady of the Nile Institute frightened away dangerous criminals, who'd come to create mayhem at the institute. Remember their names: Gloriosa and Modesta." Gloriosa and Modesta, please come forward. My dear girls, thanks to you, we narrowly escaped disaster. The institute and its students are greatly indebted to you. Gloriosa, you are our Joan of Arc. I wasn't scared. I just... Mr. Minister, go right ahead. Daughter. You were bold and courageous. Your bravery is lauded. I don't believe a word. Look at Modesta. I was only doing my duty for the republic, as should every Rwandan. She takes after her father! At the service of her country. Brothers and sisters, we have decided to step up identity checks. From now on, every rebel who is arrested will be thrown in prison for life. We're here to serve the people. Their security is our priority. - What are you making? - A dress for Dorothée. She doesn't need a heart! Those two really annoy me. Tonight, we're changing the statue's nose. You're already a national hero. You don't need this. It's not about me, it's my duty for the republic. The pilgrimage is coming up. This year, thanks to me we'll finally pray before a Rwandan statue. An authentic Hutu. I don't want to. Dummy, it's the only way to live down your dirty blood. Look. A real Hutu nose. I can't tell the difference. Modesta, come on. Come closer. Closer. Shine the light! Give me the nose. Come on. Shine the light on her face. Here. Impious hands have violated the sweet face of Mary, our Protector. To atone for this crime against God, we shall fast today. I know who broke the Virgin's face. The perpetrators of this crime were Inyenzis. My father says they follow the devil's orders. Like in Russia, they will burn the churches, kill the priests and nuns, and persecute good Christians. Thanks to the generosity of my father, the Minister, we will have a new statue of Our Lady of the Nile. A beautiful statue of a true Rwandan, with a face like the majority people. A statue we can finally be proud of. Let us sing our national anthem. Hello, Alice. You're not eating? - We have to wait. - Why? Gloriosa refuses to eat together with Tutsis. Go sit in her spot. Modesta? What are you doing? Tell me what really happened up on the hill. Why do you let Gloriosa boss you around? My father's ashamed. - He hides her. - Who? My mother. Hutu, Tutsi, Hutu. I don't understand. It's not true. Dad lied, my mom's not Tutsi. I still talk to her. - In secret... - Please... tell me. Not Hutu or Tutsi... She's just my mom. Tell me what happened on the hill! - Please. - I saw the devil. Reverend Mother, I'm sure Gloriosa's lying. There was no attack, nor any Tutsi bandits. Please, Reverend Mother. Talk to Modesta. She hasn't been herself ever since. She's hiding something. Be patient, Virginia. You're a talented girl. Intelligent. Stay out of this. - But... - That's enough! In a few weeks, you'll have your diploma. Don't ruin your life. Hurry up! Come on, let's go. Where do we put it? Go away. Four, five, six, seven... Change! One, two! Higher! This is Gloriosa speaking! In the name of the Militant Rwandan Youth and as president of the Enthronement Committee for the new Lady of the Nile, I hereby address you. With the backing of various authorities, the government and the Party, the enthronement of the new and authentic Our Lady of the Nile will be the opportunity for a rally of the Militant Rwandan Youth elite. One dozen of Rwanda's finest young men will come to our institute. The ceremony will be both religious and patriotic. The Rwandan Youth will pledge before Our Lady of the Nile to remember their slavery under oppressors which lasted so many years. The Militant Youth will continue revolutionary acts in order to fight against external enemies. Nevertheless, may we always remember that our greatest enemy comes from inside! Father. I trust you know what you're doing. But remember, we run an institute for girls. Girls alone. To bring young men here... The committee has thought it through. They will obviously be housed outside the institute. after the ceremony. This rally affects classes and upcoming exams. Is it really wise? Reverend Mother, as you know Rwanda is now an independent country. Of course. Independent. You're right, Father! She's not well at all. Modesta is ashamed to share our blood and be half-Tutsi. No. She's afraid. Stop worrying about her and think about us. We won't be spared, Virginia. We have to leave. I won't run away. I want my diploma. Forget your wretched diploma. We're on our own. No one will help us. Not the nuns, or the Reverend Mother, or even the white teachers. No one wants to get involved. Quiet! If we don't go, we'll be the first killed. I plan to hide at Fontenaille's. Are you nuts? Quiet! Why not? He's good to me. He promised to take me to Europe. Please, come with me. We'll be safe there. I'm not hiding at that white man's place. Sacrifice Don't let them get away! Quick, catch them! Open the door! Open up, please! Immaculée! What? Gloriosa's looking for you. She knows you spoke to Modesta. Hide under here. Under the sheets. Please! Trust me. Found you, cockroach! What do you want? Take your clothes off. Quick! Do it! You can't stay! I'll come get you at the witch's. Don't worry, I'll tell your mom. Go on. Go! I knew you'd be back. I'll show you where to hide. The heavy rains fall and pass, making way for the dusty season. The rain whispered to me that the season of men has changed in Rwanda, but that we must remain on our guard. Those who trust quiet times shall be struck by lightning and perish. Apply this each morning and evening, when the sun goes down. The gods invaded the Land of a Thousand and One Hills and wreaked havoc. They cleaved apart the valleys, and wrenched the waters from the earth, day from night, souls from bodies, dignity from wealth, and hope from misery. Then they departed, leaving the colonists' militants to continue their quest. There was a coup d'État. The army took power and the former president is under house arrest. But who can say it's really all over? I'm scared. I'm scared too. It was sheer horror at the institute. When the militants heard about the coup, they ran off. Everyone turned against Gloriosa. Goretti forced her to leave. What about Veronica? I don't know how to thank you. You don't have to. What will you do now? I'm done with men, I plan to go live with the gorillas. Gorillas? Really? Yes. Now I finally understand why my grandpa used to say that gorillas are a lot smarter than men. He told me that when they saw that their fellow monkeys had become men, and spent their time killing each other, the gorillas refused to become men. And you? What will you do? I'm going back home to my family, then we'll leave the country. We'll go to Burundi, or Uganda, or Zaire. Wherever we can cross the border. Rwanda has become the land of blood. In catechism, they told us that God roams the world by day, but each night, He returns home to Rwanda. Now I think that while God was traveling, Horror took His place. And when He returned, it slammed the door in His face. But I'll come back home. Subtitles: Julie Meyer & Michelle Noteboom
