Yes, Mother. - Thanks. - No problem, bro. - Is there a key? - There's no key. - I have lots of keys. - You save keys? I've collected them since I was a girl. - Think it means anything? - I didn't say that. I think she has secrets. Honey, what a sweet thing to say. Watch out! Guys, not inside. - But if you want to ride, go now. - Cool! Not alone. A.D.? All right, let's go. Okay, here we... Here we go. Let's try that again. - I can do that. - Piece of cake.

Did I know her? Your grandma? No, you didn't. She would have loved you. "Because he was..." "Chapter eight. Margalo." Because he was so small... ...Stuart was often hard to find around the house. His father and his mother and his brother George... - Seldom. - "...seldom could locate him..." ...by looking for him. Usually, they had to Call. The house often echoed... ...with cries of 'Stuart!

"I have a magic cupboard that has a magic key." I put a plastic Indian in the cupboard and he came alive. He is a real Iroquois man. "He talks. He eats. He trusts me." That's very interesting.

And we will cook meat, and we will tell stories. You tell all about me. Little Bear. - Do you keep the men, Omri? - Just the bow and arrow. Can I watch? He is Mohawk. It is an excellent bow.

Do people die here? People die. We just don't see them. How do you not see them? Come down here, please. Can't I just send him back? You are afraid of him? A dead man? You are a child. Yes, send him back. - What if he was alone? - Then he is alone! - Where were you? - Guiding my nephew through the woods... ...to live alone for a season, learn to be a man. You should not do magic you do not understand! Omri, now. Send him back. He would want to be back. Are you mad at me? What did you do with them? - I buried them. - My saw blades? Why? Those are my things. I work with them. I need them now. What do you want me to do? We'll go to Yapp's and buy a set. Come on. I can go alone. It's, like, a block away. You don't need to go with me like I'm a baby. Besides, I've been before. You just didn't know. Okay. YAPP'S HARDWARE What'd you get? Let me see what you got. What is this junk? Give me the money. Hey! You! Come back! You don't deserve that hair! Hey, Omri. Look. I got this guy to go with your Indian. Patrick? Omri. Are you okay? Omri, are you sure you're okay? Patrick? Patrick. - Jeez, this thing's incredible. - Get your hands out of the way. Where do you think he got this? Look at how small it is. - What are you guys looking at? - Omri, this is incredible. How did you make this? Don't bring that rat in here. I found him in here, and my figures and my magnifying glass. What else do you have that's mine? That thing was in here? This is great. Dad should see this. I want you both to leave my room right now! Jeez Louise, temperamental. Hey! You've got to promise me. What? Little Bear, where are you? - Little Bear? - What are we looking for? Little Bear. Little Bear? Little Bear? Here. It's all right. You can come out. I heard them, and I ran. - That was good. - They are enemies? Brothers. "Brothers"? Those brothers took my house! I'm in the dark here. Send me back. I want to go back. But I brought my friend to meet you. Patrick, Little Bear. Another Great Spirit? Make another little man? No. No more men. - Little Bear, will you come out? - No, you come in. This is the plastic Indian? Not plastic anymore. How did you do that? - The cupboard. - Show me. Put a plastic thing in and lock it. If it's a person, the person is alive. They are real people. They can even be real dead people. - I want to make a live one. - Never. It's an enormous, huge responsibility. I'm a responsible person. Omri? I'm down here. - Don't touch the cupboard. - Okay. I mean it, Patrick. It means a lot to me. Thank you. I heard. Can I see your arm? Yeah. You all right? You need to wash that. It's not much. This child has a very strong will. The good ones all have a strong will. Patrick is just plain defiant. - No! No! - Yes. No, it's not a game! Whoa, Darling! Whoa, Darling! Hey! Hey! Hey! God dang it, put me down! Dang. Tarnation. No more. I promise, no more. Bulldog! - Not another drop. - He's mine. Patrick, shut your eyes! Watch out, Patrick! Get back, get back. Come on. He... He shot me! He shot me! Deliriums! Hellfire and damnation, it's the deliriums! That cheap, rotten Kansas sheep-dip. William Howard? Where are you, you potbellied drunkard? Anthony Miles? Come out, you son of a buck's horse's ass! I can't believe it. He really shot me. He doesn't belong here. We've got to put him back. - What the hell you doing over there? - I can't believe it. - This is great. - This is not so great. - This has got to be a delirium. - I want him! - Where's my hat? - He can't stay. - I want to keep him. - Now I've lost my God dang hat! Can we please send him back, Patrick? I'm coming to get you, Darling! - Patrick... - I want him, Omri. Not one more drop as long as I live. Oh, my dear, sweet Lord. I need a drink. This is just getting worse by the minute. What's your name? Boone. What's yours, Mr. Delirium? He is so cool. Step back, cow pie. How will you take care of him? - Patrick, time to go. - I'm coming! Let me keep him. Okay. - Yes! - It has to stay secret... ...or we'll lose him. Let me keep him here tonight. I have this under control. Will you bring him to school tomorrow? School? Everybody's so big. You'll be okay. Don't cry. I always cry. The boys call me Boo-Hoe Boone. - I've got a soft heart. - Patrick! - Bring him to school, promise? - I promise. Don't put them together. Cowboys and Indians. "Indians"? Oh, and Omri? Don't turn him back, please. Okay! What Injuns? Redskins. No! Hey! Wait! You better put me down! Who do you think you are? I'm telling you the truth: I'll lay you in your grave! I don't care how big you are. Kindly return to me my hat, tenderfoot. You said you'd take no more men. You tell blind stories. You better watch out that savage don't scalp you in your sleep. Injun lover! Hey! Wait! What are you...? You're not shutting me up in here. LEGO SYSTEM NO PARKING WEDNESDAY Now we become reconciled as you start away. Now we become reconciled as you start away. Don't you want this open? I'm not scared anymore. You can close it. Okay. - Is she in the dark? - What do you mean? - Does she know of me? - No. I am alone. I need a wife. Darling, you stay. Come on, let's fight! Hey! Darling? Darling! Darling! Darling! Every time I try to... We're supposed to be a team! Hey! Dang! What's the matter with that Injun? No, no! Stop! Behave! Behave! He says I steal his horse. He shoots at me! If that's true, I'll squish him like a bug. Boone, drop it! Well, she's my horse! Drop it! No! Hey! Hey! I'm tired of getting hauled around... Knew you'd take the side of that stinking savage! He smells, Omri, and he calls me a dirty savage. I didn't call you dirty. I called you stinking! Stop it, Boone. Listen to me. Boone is leaving. - You don't have to live together. - Where is my coffee? I like to start my day with coffee. If you'll be good, I'll make you breakfast. Omri cooks like a woman. You are a woman! Oh, please. You guys are so old-fashioned. I'll have you know I am a civilized man. Unlike some! Where did you come from? I come from Texas, Mr. Half-a-brain! The United States of America, comprende? - Omri? "Texas"? - You're from Texas? I'm proud of it. Where did you say you're taking me? - I'm taking you to school. - White man goes to school? - That's right. - Yes. - I go to school. - No, you wouldn't like it. - If he can go, I can go. - It's too risky. - Whiskey? - "Risky"! Dangerous! Good, I like danger. Do you like danger, Texas man? Are you threatening me, Injun? You'll need help to get this scalp. Omri, send him back. Do it. Patrick! Hey, Patrick, come on! Come on! Come on! Bye-bye. You got him? You got him? Be careful, Patrick. He's so delicate. Come here. - Boone's in the front. - Let me have him! - Careful! - Let me out. - I've got to check on Little Bear. - Where's the Injun? - Take it easy! - Let me have him! Quit poking on me. - I can come out too! - Just give me it! Boys? School, remember? Thank you very much, Malcolm and Georgia. Thank you. All right, now let's have Emily and Loretta. Loretta and I... Loretta and I are making a map of the United States. We built it here on a piece of wood. We made the whole country out of flour... ...and water and salt and food coloring. We're using beans for the mountains... ...yarn for the rivers, and rice for the borders. We're making the desert out of brown sugar. I thought America should be green and yellow... ...but Loretta thought it should be beige. What in the hell are these folks talking about? Sounds like they've been hitting the old tornado juice. You ever been west of the Mississippi? Big river? I have traveled to the far North. Land of the Micmacs. Micmacs, huh? Sounds too cold for me. Must be pretty country, though. Yes. Cold. Pretty. Thank you very much. Okay, now let's have... - ...Omri and Patrick. - I'll do it! - We agreed that I'll do it. - I'm the best talker. You know that. Patrick and I are making a volcano. It's made out of mixed-up Play-Doh... ...and it's big and... Smallpox. Yes. Will you marry again, Little Bear? If there is a woman for me. Maybe have another little child. Yes. I will heal when I have another child. Little children are the sun and the moon and the stars. Good morning, boys and girls. Today's lunch is macaroni and cheese and a build-your-own sandwich. Also, don't worry about the library iguana. Molting is a natural process. Origami is canceled today. Damn. Everybody, stay in double line, please. Thank you. Follow Mrs. Cox. Omri, that's a wonderful story that you're writing. - Yeah. - Have you read about the Iroquois? Yeah? What interested you the most about them? There were six tribes that joined together to stop the war. They formed a true government. Our Constitution borrowed a lot from the Iroquois. - Yeah. - So what else? As you know, I have to go to computer class. - I'll show you. - No! Hey! What are you doing? Are you crazy? - I'm having fun. - This is real! - They're two real men. It's not fun! - Shove it! Hello. Excuse me. What's going on here? What happened? What happened? All right. Somebody start talking. We can't resolve this now. - I think we need to try. - I can resolve it. Want to see how? - No! - I could do it! - Do what? - No, no, no! You... - I could show, I could. - Show what? You can't! They're people! You can't use people! All right. Patrick, show me what's in your pouch, please. Please. Show me what's in your pouch. They're just plastic toys. Plastic people. They're just completely plastic. - Plast... - Okay. That's fine, Omri. - Fine. - Plastic. Yes. Thank you. Let me see. Plastic. Let me see. They're just people- All right, you two work this out. But no more fighting, okay? All right. Go catch up with your class. "It's like having a child." Every time I'm away from him, I worry that he is okay. I come home and open the door... ...and worry about what I will find. But he is a man. "I can't treat him like a baby." Good. Sam? "JFK." JFK was the youngest man ever president. "There were little kids in the White House." Mom, can Patrick please spend the night? - Yeah, I think so. - Spend the night? It's a wife. Excuse me. It's all right. Come on. Look at them. I've got to go. Who Will She be? What is that? - It's a wife. - A wife? - My mother should choose me a wife. - But your mother's not here. I've been thinking about settling down my own self. It's gone. The cupboard's gone. Who would take it? - Where is it? - Where's what? - What the hell? - The cupboard, butthead! Who gave you that cupboard? Please, where's the cupboard? Gilly, please. Where's my rat ball? Where? Please? In the crawl space. Man! The key, the key! Where's the key'? There was no key. I swear. You mean we've got to live here forever? Little like this? No new wife for Little Bear, no baby? He needs a baby. I could look for another key. I want to go home. We just got the railroad coming through town... ...and we've got a new doctor, a good doctor. Hell, it's 1879. I'm living at the dawn of a new century. Now I know what you was talking about. God sure do play with men, all right. There is no God here. Come on, Gilly! Bye, Mom! Bye, Dad! - Bye, guys. - Bye. Mom! Disgusting display. And they do this in front of you children? - It's not real. - It's real, all right, son. It's real. Let's change to the Discovery Channel. Roaming the great savannas of Africa. Let me see that clicker. As it relates... Apaches. The ugliest redskins ever to walk the face of the earth. Get them, boys! Hell, yeah! Little Bear? Amigo? He is alive. I wish we had Tommy. We do not have the key. Can you take the arrow out? Blood will flow. Get me husks. We have no husks. Leave me. Boys? Time for bed. - Can you turn out the light, please? - Sure. I feel like I haven't seen you in days. Cartoon day tomorrow. I don't think we'll watch, thanks. - Good night. - Good night, Mom. - Good night, Patrick. - Good night. If you hear noises, it's Gilly's rat. - What? - He escaped. Dad pulled up that loose floorboard under your table, but couldn't get him. - That rat's under my floor? - Maybe. He might have moved on. If we're lucky, he moved out. - Oh, no. - I know. Good night, guys. Do you think he'll be okay? A rat will eat at a wounded man. Now we really can't go to sleep at all. We'll take turns. If you go first, I'll give you a million dollars. Okay. Patrick. Patrick, wake up. Patrick, I hear the rat. Patrick, get up! It's the key! It's the key! Get it! Hold this. Watch out. Oh, no. Let me go. I am too big. I am too big. See if you can get under that loose floorboard over there. There's an animal. A big animal. Move fast. Do you see a way? Is there a hole? Yes, I see one. - Omri? - Yeah? What are also dangers? Everything. Did he take his bow and arrow? Does he have his knife? Little Bear! Where is he? Little Bear! I hear him! Over there! Little Bear. Little Bear! OPERATION - Where is he? - Come back! Oh, come back, come back. - What was that? - I don't know. Please, Little Bear, come back. Why won't he come? Omri. I got him! Oh, it's you again! I do pick my moments to fall asleep, I must say. Thundering great Minnie whining overhead. Thought I was a goner. Perhaps I am a goner. Did I die? No, you're dreaming again. There's two of you now'? Good show. Well, take me to him. The elegant Injun, is it? No, it's another. Oh, that's clever. Hello again. - The bleeding stopped. - Yes. Good. He could use a blood transfusion, but I'm not prepared for that. A bullet, was it? Arrow. Well, lucky it missed his heart and lung. Cotton's damp. So you're a pal of his, are you? Amigo. There we go. That should do it. Look, keep a close watch on him. Plenty of water. He could use a doctor's care. There's a doctor in his town. No. - When he wakes up. - Not yet. It's time for them to go home, Patrick. Good. That will do. He needs to sleep. Well, I best be getting back. We'll all be waking up soon. I suggest a drop of brandy. - Thank you. - You're welcome, mate. Buckles keep catching on me doo-dah. Omri! I'm so ashamed of myself. I hurt you. What are you talking about? Did I hear somebody say something about brandy? No, Omri. She has her life. She has a family... ...a clan... ...maybe a husband and a child. I don't want you to be alone. I will be with my people. Omri? I will be with you when the sun rises? One more time. Hey, son. When we go back, are we going to the last thing we remember, or ahead? I don't know. I hope it's forwards. How about you, Little Bear? Little Bear! Where are you headed? I was on the journey with my brother's son. I think I will wake up in the woods. It is quiet. The nights are getting cold. I can almost smell the trees. Lord, I can almost smell them too. It's like I'm part Indian now. If you were my nephew... ...it would almost be time to walk you through the forest. I would go. It is difficult. You would live by yourself, care for yourself. We would travel for days... ...tell stories... ...hunt and fish. I'd leave you and return to the village. You must live alone for one season. You would learn to live in harmony with Mother Nature... ...the two-legged, four-legged... ...the winged. When the seasons changed... ...my nephew would come home. I would be waiting for you. We would have a great celebration... ...because you returned to the village as a man. When I leave you, Omri... ...I take you... ...as my nephew. Time to go, gentlemen. Easy, Darling. Easy now. Don't y'all forget me. I won't. You look after yourself, Little Bear. And you, friend. Goodbye, my friendly giants. - Great Spirit? - Yes, Little Bear? Tell me about the Onöñda'gega'. Are we always a great people? You are always a great people. But it's not always so good. Things change for us. They will. We go. Now! "I will never know where he is or how he is..." ...but now I don't worry about him anymore. I think Little Bear will have lots of children... ...and he will teach them everything. "He will always take care of his people." That's all. Very nice. That's a good ending, Omri. Sam? "One day, JFK was killed." He was shot on a street in Texas. "My Grandpa says that he remembers exactly where he was..."
