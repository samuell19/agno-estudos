Miz Kellty? You don't need me, Mr. Baring. Just wasting my time again. You know where I am. No square dancing! Do you reckon he ought to be in the hospital? No, ma'am. My advice is, don't go near those places unless they pay you a heap of money. Your father's 87 years old, Janet. Just be there for him. Don't worry. I ain't a-gonna go nowhere. Been lookin' for you all over, Jerry. Take care. See ya. Thanks for seein' Papa. Sure. Billy Fisher found her. He delivers the groceries out there. I guess she's what you'd call a hermit. She talked kinda funny too. She's kinda like, uh... Only one side of her face was working. You try talking out of one side of your face. Oh, so you seen her then? Just the once, when I first moved out here. Seemed to me she was doin' okay. Oh, sure, now, she lived her own life. Didn't know there were folks livin' this far out. Well, there aren't, just old Miz Kellty. God, it's beautiful. Well, look at that. Just laid herself down, folded her arms and died. Don't look like she's been gone long. No. In this heat, you'd know if she'd been dead more than a day. Well, anything I should be concerned about? Not that I can see. I guess she hasn't been outside in a long time. Well, that figures. Last time I seen her in town is more'n a year back. Is this for real? No electricity, no phone, no running water. Wow. She lived here all alone, hmm? Well, that's what hermits do, Lovell. They live alone and they die alone. Peterson to Robbinsville base. Okay-hey-hey, we're outta here! Let's get back to civilization. Billy Fisher found her when he delivered the groceries? Yeah, that's right. I'll catch up with you. Hi, there. It's okay. I won't hurt you. Stay back! Well, what the hell is it? Stay back! - What the hell is it, Jerry? - Put the gun away. Let go of my gun, Jerry. Come on. Get out. She's scared. She's scared? Holy shit! What... Good God Almighty. You ever heard of anyone else living out here? No, never. Are you all right? Did you get hurt? Fine, fine. Jesus. Okay, let's take this one step at a time. Stay here. I'm gonna go back inside. Jerry, I can't let you go back in there. We don't even know what that thing is. It's a human being, and she's frightened. Well, what are you gonna do? Talk to her... if I can. Doana yow Nell. Doana yow Nell. Smi'eva'dur. An ga'inja come an smi'ev... Please, don't be afraid. "The Lord led you here, stranger. Guard my Nell." Nell. "Good child. The Lord care you." Man, did you see this? That crazy old woman owned half of this damn woods. What kind of deal's this? The first stranger who finds her is supposed to look after her? That means you, Jer. Oh, sure. Just what I need. Well, "The Lord led you here." There you go. You led me here. You want the Lord to take care of you or not? The last time I saw the Lord was in church on my wedding day, and look how that turned out. Come on. Well, she's definitely over age, so I guess we notify the Adult Protective Service. She doesn't need a social worker, she needs a padded cell. That is one seriously disturbed lady. Well, I'm afraid that's going to be your territory, Jerry. Thanks. Well, the Lord led you here, stranger. It's okay. All right. The toy's broken. It's okay. Calm down. Calm down. It's all right. Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. No. Calm down. Come in. - Dr. Olsen? - Can you close the door, please? Thanks. They said it was fine to drop by. I'm Jerry Lovell. I've got a family practice over in Robbinsville. Hi. This is my assistant, Diane. So, what can I do for you? Well, I could use some advice. Mm-hmm. It's all right. It's all right. Calm down. This woman speaks an unknown language? Her mother was paralyzed on one side, apparently a series of strokes. It's possible the girl picked up the speech distortions. Speech distortion's not an unknown language. I know. It's more than that. Well, I want to see her right away. How about first thing in the morning... 9:00? Thanks. If you're not too busy, I... ♪ Down came the rain ♪ ♪ And washed the spider out ♪ Well, no known living next of kin. Violet Kellty's just about as lone as a soul can get in this world. Hmm. Except she wasn't. Sheriff's Department. Now, officially, that... creature does not exist. Todd. There. See what you make of that. Right here? Mm-hmm. Peterson. Yeah, hey, Sally. Where is she now? I'll be right over. Yeah, thanks, Sally. I appreciate your trouble. You think that's how she got pregnant... rape? I have to go. Mary, huh? Yeah. My Mary. You'll be all right now, honey. He's on his way. He's a-comin'. Thanks, Sally. It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay. I'm here now. Did you get upset? Hey! Let's go home. Want me to take you on home? Come on. Come on. There you go. Okay, folks. The show's over. You guys okay? Yeah, yeah. We been here before. Hi! You found me. Mm-hmm. Early. Yeah, I'm always early. Not a bad day. What happened to her? Nothing and everything. It hits her once in a while. Is there any obvious cause? You want a list? Life's tough. But she's luckier than some. She's got a good husband there. Ready to head for the woods? The things people do to their kids. Jesus. She's not like that when she's on her own. Strangers scare her. How do you know? - I've been watching her. - Uh-huh. Mmm. She's been completely isolated, almost certainly mentally retarded. Blood tests will pick up childhood disease, any kind of metabolic disorder. Oh. You carry a blood kit? You think she's gonna sit and let me stick a needle in her? I'll hold her. Okay now. Do it! Shh. Shh. Do it! Shh. Shh. It's okay. If you're right... a big if... and she's never left this cabin or this part of the forest, never known anybody but her mother, never encountered any of the images of the modern world, never seen a car, a television, a gun, a Hershey bar, never heard rock and roll music. Now, you said she can talk. Yeah, but it's some kind of language of her own. We haven't had a true wild child in this country for 60 years. She's not a wild child. It's just a shorthand term, Dr. Lovell. - She's not a child. - No. That's what makes this case so unique. This is not your field, I know, but let me tell you what we're dealing with here. Some pretty fundamental issues. How was the personality formed? We don't know. How much is innate? How much is learned? We don't know. Where do gender roles come from? We don't know. Because you can't take a baby and have it in a lab and monitor and control every influence. You wanna have her grow up in a lab? Grow up in a lab? No. Dr. Lovell thinks you're gonna do a Frankenstein number on her, Al. Oh, well, all right. Let me ask you this, Dr. Lovell. Can she survive on her own? Well... I don't know. Well, all right. Suppose she cannot. Who's gonna look after her... you? Me? Why me? All right. So who's volunteering? I can tell you this much: It's gonna be somebody with an ulterior motive. Everybody who cares for someone has an ulterior motive, even Mother Teresa. She wants to know that her life has been of some use to others. And so do I. Excuse me. Oh, shit. Yeah, I'm on my way. Well, Lovell, did I wake you up? Hey, Todd. It's okay. I overslept. What's up? I'm lookin' at a commitment order that's just been issued for Nell. What... What does that mean? It means they're gonna take her away. It's a court order, Jerry. I have to enforce it. When? Now? That's what it says. Can you give me some time? I guess I could hold off till after lunch. Try and make it a long lunch, will you? Well, what do you say there, Don? Not fishin' today? Todd. Sorry about this, Jerry. Hoo! Hi. - Well, we've come to pick Nell up. - Yeah. I heard. I've got the court order. You do know it's in her own best interest, right? Did you ask her? Well, you know that's impossible. Tell 'em, Don. Well, I have a court order here that says... if you don't get Nell's informed consent, you're violatin' her rights. And if you do that, I'm gonna sue you all the way to the Supreme Court. How can she give her informed consent? Huh? She doesn't even speak English! Well, if she doesn't speak English, she has to give her consent through an interpreter. What interpreter? This is crazy. There isn't anybody who speaks her language! Then I guess somebody's gonna have to learn. T'ee an me an t'ee an me. Ressa, ressa, ressa me. Chicka, chicka, chickabee... Dr. Lovell's view seems to be that this woman's natural habitat... is a primitive cabin in the heart of the forest. Well, I take a different view. I see a victim of abuse and neglect. I see a mature woman who's been robbed of half her life. Chicka, chicka, chickabee... Her mother never gave her a choice. Isn't Dr. Lovell doing the same thing... Hiding her away as his own private pet in the woods? We all know what happens to these freak cases, Your Honor. They get a year of celebrity, a starring role in a few academic papers, then they get to spend the rest of their lives in a state institution, abandoned by the very doctors and scientists who claimed to be helping them. Nell has a home. She has a life. She's not asking for any help. So just be sure she needs care, before she gets cared to death. If she's ever gonna leave that cabin, she's gonna need skills... - she doesn't possess. - How do you know she wants to leave the cabin? That's the best we can give her? I don't think her life is ours to give. People can help each other, Dr. Lovell. We don't have to do everything on our own. Okay, I think I'm gettin' the picture. Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna defer my decision for three months, this time to be used for the purposes of observation and assessment. And I hope that by the end of this period, this court is better informed. - Hey. - You sure you can make it, roughin' it like this? I don't see an air conditioning unit. You okay about breathing raw air? Oh. Wow. Who's paying for this floating palace? My department. This project has very high priority. Oh, I bet it does. - So, how long are you staying? - Three months. - Don't you have a life? - It can wait. How long are you stayin'? I don't know. Won't your patients miss you? I've got someone to cover for me. Everybody's replaceable. So I guess you'll make full professor on the back of this case, huh? Sure. Why not? Look, I'm here to do a job. Anything that helps me do that job is fine by me. If you want to be a Boy Scout, go ahead, but I'd appreciate it if you could do your best not to screw it up. Missa, missa, chickabee.

That's "may," me, me in the mirror. You'd think it would be the other way around, but that's me out there, almost like she's displacing herself. Have you run any tests? Only blood work, and no abnormalities there. We'll have to run competency tests before the court hearing, but I'd say it's still too soon. - I want you to hear this language she speaks. - What is this gesture about? I don't know. It's some kind of self comforting. She did it when she was saying "may." Um, you should explain the speech degradation is misleading. Th-That's right. Um, the mother was aphasic, but the idiosyncratic word forms... You tell me. Ah si'fu' naish. Ah peep'u lai' wi' neek'ty. Incredible. Chickabee. Missa, missa chickabee. Nell? Lilten dogies. Lilten sees. Chickabee, chickabee, chickabee-bee-bee. You mind if I talk? I like it here. It's a quiet place. You've got the right idea, Nell. You live with people, you get problems. First they screw you up, then they leave you, right? You ever get lonely, Nell? I never had any brothers and sisters either. Very unusual for an Irish family, Dr. Lovell. Oh, sure, you better believe it. God, there was a family lived next door... the Connors. The Connors. They had seven kids... seven. Always yellin' and screamin', havin' a good time. Me watching... over a fence, through a window. I heard music... a band. This parade was coming down the street. I'm on our front steps. Jamie Connor grabs me, pulling me into the street. "No, no, no, no, no." My heart's going ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom. The band's goin'... Oh, but I was so excited. Jamie's got me by my hand. We're doin' this. Some kid's got my other hand, the band right behind us. You get close to a band, you know about it. I'm marching and with the other kids. I wasn't alone. You know what I'm sayin'? We weren't talking, just... Just enjoying this wonderful spirit. Ga'inja. Ga'inja. Fo'tye Maw waw wi'a law. Ne-Nell, tch, Nell done kee, onakowna Maw bin fearly.

I didn't ask for that. She did. I know. "Ga'inja." "Je'y kine'ey ga'inja." Jerry "kine'ey ga'inja." You know what it means? No! Okay, so, here's what I've been thinkin'. Nell speaks English. English? Oh, come on. Yeah. Most of the time anyway. Look. Come here. Take a look at this. "Af'ah I done go, ga'inja come." There's only one word of pure Nellish there. Sounds like language analysis to me, Dr. Olsen. All right. Okay. "Spee"... speak. "Af'ah"... after. She's droppin' consonants. Yeah, but... what does "chickabee" mean? She says "missa chickabee." What's "missa"? I don't know. When she's scared, she says "tata." - "Tata." What's that? - I don't know yet. "Ga'inja." "Je'y kine'ey ga'inja." Where is she? Oh, chicka, chicka, chickabee. Chicka, chicka, chickabee. T'ee an me an t'ee an me. Look at that. Ressa, ressa, ressa me. - We shouldn't be watchin' this. - Why not? She's naked. So? I think she's beautiful. Mm-hmm. You think I'm planning to abuse the doctor-patient relationship? Are you? No. Just because I think she's beautiful doesn't mean I want to have sex with... I mean, I think you're beautiful, but... Thanks. You know what I mean. It's okay. No. Look, I didn't mean... It's okay. I'm a big girl. What is it with you and Nell? It's like... there's no one else in the world. Like she doesn't need anybody. Can you live your whole life that way, or... does it drive you crazy in the end? Missa t'ee. Missa t'ee. Missa t'ee. Missa... I don't understand, Nell. What's "missa"?

Well, that could be all that's keepin' her from comin' out in the daytime... A deliberately implanted phobia. Why is she more likely to be raped in the daytime? She isn't, but she's more likely to be seen in the daytime. And Violet didn't want anyone to see Nell. Yep. I buy that. So, what do we do with phobics? Get them to face what they're afraid of, neutralize their fear. We could do that. Hey. Uh-uh. Not so fast. - You're a man. You're an eva'dur. - Wait a minute. No, I'm not. Yes, I'm a man.

Well, I'd guess the age of between six and ten. We're lookin' at 20 years, at least. We want her in here, Paula, just as soon as the court hearing's over. Jerry thinks she should be left where she is. Jerry? Dr. Lovell. Ah, yes. You know, Al, Nell has her own way of doin' things. I'd say she can probably handle it on her own. Well, um... Uh, let me give you a little peek into the future, Paula. One day soon, some hiker or fisherman... is gonna come walking out of those woods with a story about a wild woman. And that'll bring the news reporters. The news reports will bring the crowds. The crowds will bring the talk show hosts. Nell will find she's hired a lawyer, an agent, a manager and three bodyguards. You think she can handle that? Hello? Anybody home? Hello? Anybody home? Hi. Mike Ibarra. I'm a journalist. Charlotte Tribune. Um, I heard you were livin' up here. Well, I... I hope you don't mind me comin' by. Look, is, uh... is it okay if I take a picture? Have you ever seen one of these before? It-It's called a camera, see? And, uh, I look at you... through this little window here, see? Now, I'm lookin' at you through this window, and... - - Hey! No, no, no. It's okay. Really. It's okay. You hurt her, you're dead, buddy! I never touched her! All I did was take her picture. You press? Charlotte Tribune. Okay. I'm sorry. I guess I overreacted. Look, I'm her doctor. Do me a favor, will ya? Forget you ever met her. Mike Ibarra. Lovell. Well, it's like this, Dr. Lovell. - I'm a newsman. - Yeah, well, find some other news. You saw how you scared her. Nell, you okay? Nell? She's called Nell? "She's called Nell?" "She's called Nell?" Why can't she just be left alone to live as she damn well pleases? You know, uh, once word gets out, we might as well start sellin' tickets. So what do we do, huh? Build a wall around the woods? Well, maybe she's gonna have to go somewhere else. - Like where? - Somewhere where she can be protected. Like a psychiatric unit, maybe? So, what's your suggestion? Check her into a Holiday Inn? Al Paley's the best man in the field. Let him stay in his field. Nell doesn't need him. So who does she need? You? She could do worse. What have you got to offer? What's your big plan for Nell? I don't make plans. That's your game... Yours and Al's. Go play it somewhere else and leave us out of it. It's "us" now, is it? Jerry and Nell, the happy couple? What would you know about happy couples? Well, what would you know about Nell? I've spent more time with her than you have. Oh, yeah, I noticed. What's that supposed to mean? You ever ask yourself why you like hangin' around Nell so much? - Great. Here we go again. - Not exactly a grown woman, is she? - Not exactly a threat. - You wanna know what your problem is?

She's gonna have to take some kind... of competency test before a court hearing. Those tests don't prove a... I know. It's time to show her the big bad world... and see how she handles it. Uh-huh. Okay. Hold still. Loo', Je'y. Jus' like Pau'. Slow down. Whoo! It's all right. It's just noise, Nell. Mommy! This is it, Nell. What do you say, Jerry? Hey, Todd. You know Dr. Olsen. Oh, yeah.

I believe she wants a little action. Get goin', Billy. Hi, there, baby. Anything I can do you for? Now, you'll have to excuse me. Just correct me if I'm wrong, here, Miss Wild Thing, but... you-you don't understand a word I'm sayin', do you? That's right. You don't understand a word... that I'm sayin', do you? That's right. You know, it's gettin' a little bit hot in here, gentlemen. Why don't you just... light my fire. - - You light my fire, darlin'. That's right. Ah, that's it! What, you want... you wanna show me somethin'? You wanna show me them... Them are titties. Can you say "titties"? Tit... Titties. Titties. That's right. Shake 'em. That's right. Turn all about. Right. That's it, girl. Turn all about. Let's do the titty dance. That's right. Hey, I got an idea. You want to see my body? You... Is that what you want? Huh? Whoo! Titties! Titties!

She still lookin' at it? Yeah. Did your parents do this for you? You gotta be kiddin' me. My mother would die before she'd give me a book like that. No way. Uh-uh. So how'd you learn? Go on. Tell Dr. Lovell. Girlfriends at school. Ah. So what about you? Well... Come on. Don't be shy. Come on. Bathroom walls. - Bathroom walls? - Je'y? Nell. How yo' caw this? Um... Making love. Je'y.

It has to help Nell if we look as if we're gettin' along. That's why I let her identify us with the pictures. I hope you don't mind. Nope. All the, uh, research shows that... children who perceive their parents as havin' a good sex life... grow up to make far better sexual relationships themselves. Is that so? Yeah, that's so. Did your parents have a good sex life? Three guesses. What went wrong? My daddy left home when I was 13. My mom still doesn't know why. She was always laughin' and smilin'. We were all supposed to be havin' such a good time. My dad liked happy people, and so she was happy for him. She was so hurt. Shit. You know what I hate? The way we're all... We're all trapped in these cycles goin' around and around. It doesn't seem to me like you're repeating the same pattern. Oh, sure. I'm just playin' the flip side, right? Nobody's gonna hurt me, so... so I don't... I don't feel that much, even when I want to. Shit. Nell, what... Is anything the matter? An'thin' a' matter? An'thin' a' matter? Doana kee. Mm-mmm. I'm not... I'm not cryin'. Doana kee, missa chickabee. Oh, hell. Yes, I am. Doana kee. Doana kee, missa chickabee. ♪ Lilten pogies ♪ ♪ Lilten dogies ♪ ♪ Lilten sees ♪ ♪ Lilten awes ♪ Paula? Paula?

Todd, get us out of here! Hold on. Whoo! Excuse me. Shh. Almost there. We're almost there. No. Nell. Nell. It's okay. You'll have to carry her. It's gonna be all right. It's gonna be all right. Shh.

Take her to the room. Mi'i! Mi'i! Settle down, everybody! Quiet! No sedatives. We don't wanna set the whole ward off. You can go in to see her... just as soon as you're quiet. It's all right. It's all right. Come on, Nell. It's Jerry. Oh, chickabee. Nay tata, Nell. Nay tata wi' Je'y. Huh? This is not her normal behavior. She hasn't freaked out like this for weeks, Al. You saw the damn tapes. I'm not happy about this, Paula. She's out of her familiar environment. You've had almost three months. I want her in here so we can begin... what we should've been doing from the start. I must have been out of my mind to bring her here. Christ. She needs time, Al. That's all. Come on. Well... We've got the weekend. Maybe by Monday, I'll feel happier. Maybe not. They'll shut you away! Show them how you really are! Please! "My beloved is gone down into his garden..." "to the beds of spices..." "to feed in the gardens..." "and to gather lilies." "I am my beloved," "and my beloved is mine." "He feedeth among the lilies." "Thou art beautiful, O my love," "as Tirzah." This isn't lower level autism. That's for sure. "Terrible as any army with banners." "Turn away thine eyes from me," "for they will overcome me." "Blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof... "may flow out. "Let my beloved come into his garden... and eat his pleasant fruits." I wanna take her out of here, Paula. We can't. One more day. That's all. You think the judge is gonna say he knows better than Al Paley? I'm taking her out. Jerry! Come on. Come on. You're gonna walk. You're gonna walk. Here we go. Come on. I'm taking you out of here. I'm taking you out! Shie alo'lay. Shie alo'lay! Come on. Wait a second! Here we go. Move! Sorry. No, not a word. Yeah, I know. Days Inn. Um, 601 North Tryon. Room 221. No, we're not going anyplace. I never meant it to be like this, Nell. I'm not your guardian angel. Sorry. But J'ey feliss aw tye wi' Nell. But I guess all that's over now. Ahh. Ahh, Mi'i. Thou ah beau'fu, o ma love, as Tirzah... come'ey as Jerus'em. Ahhh. How long she been like this? She's been out for over an hour now. Just laid herself down and went to sleep. Why here? I didn't know where else to go. So what are we gonna do now? I'm gonna have to take her to court tomorrow, aren't I? Yes. So that's it. Shit. I could take it if she'd say something to me. Anything but this silence. Doana kee. Doana kee, missa chickabee. Nell is on the threshold of a hazardous journey. We can guide her on that journey, but what we can't do is turn the clock back. She can never be a child again. But, uh, we're not here to choose... between her new life and an old life. Her new life has already begun. Our task here today... is to determine how we can best help her... as she takes her first steps into a wider world. And in your opinion, Professor, Nell does need help? I don't think that's in doubt. You don't think she's capable of looking after herself? No, I do not. What do you think she's been doing for the last three months? It's my impression for the past three months she's made no progress at all. Your counsel will have the opportunity to put questions to the professor. What do you call progress? Turning into someone like you? - Lovell, I insist. - There's no need to be personal here, Dr. Lovell. I happen to like Nell, Professor. What you do to her is personal to me, okay? Counsel, you want to control your client? You and Dr. Olsen have become emotionally involved with your patient. She is not my patient. She is not sick. She throws fits. She bangs her head against a wall. - It was a glass wall! She didn't see it. - Dr. Lovell, take your seat. She displays many of the symptoms of Asberger's... Oh, bullshit! She just doesn't wanna talk to you! - Does she wanna talk to you, Dr. Lovell? - Dr. Lovell, sit down! Nell. Fro' tye Maw waw wi'a law, Nell done come lone. I-I'm sorry. Dr. Lovell? Je'y? Spee' fo Nell. Fro' tye Maw waw wi'a Lord, Nell done come lone. She says since her mother died, she's been alone. Nell bin tata. She's been afraid. Bu' alo'so tata, alo'lay. Anna kine'ey law, he... He lilten us'kee, us'erna kee. Everyone's frightened everywhere. The sweet Lord soothes our tears, our many tears. Our world has... many people in it, Nell, people who can be your friends. Nell. Alo'so... done go. Reckon? Wanna? But you have many things to learn. Erna t'ang fo' know'n. Don't you want that? Wanna? Yo' ha' erna t'ang. You have big things. Yo' know'n erna t'ang. You know big things. Ma' yo' nay seen inna alo'sees. But you don't look into each other's eyes. Yo' aken af'a lilta-lilt. And you're... hungry for quietness. Ah done pass'a missa lye. I've lived a small life. Ah know'n missa t'ang. I know small things. Chicka'so. I know... loved ones. J'ey... an Pau... an Maw... and Mi'i. An ah know'n tha' alo'so done go. I know everyone goes. Alo'so done go away. Everyone goes away. An Nell... Nell lone. J'ey ressa wi' J'ey, an Nell ressa wi' Nell. Yeah. I guess so. Nay tata fo' Nell. Don't be frightened for Nell. Nay kee fo' Nell. Don't weep for her. No ah'ha erna keena'n yo. I have no... greater sorrows than you. Yo'kay... missa chickabee? Yo'kay? Is Ruthie still asleep? Yep. Almost there. Mm-hmm. Well, has everybody got everything they need? Todd, you gotta tell me where I can find someone who can cook like this. How can she cook and bake in life? You gotta grow up in the woods a little bit. Hey, what'd I tell ya? You just start eatin' and they'll show up. It never fails. We finally made it. I don't believe it. Nell, do something about those hills, will ya? Happy birthday, darlin'. Happy birthday. Hey, Paula. Come on, Ruthie. Isn't she sweet? Here. How are ya? How are ya? Bass ain't hittin' this stink bait today. Well, they ain't gonna hit nothin' if you don't hush up. What you usin', Don? Old spinner. You know Mr. Bass can't resist that. I can't tell you how many times I've seen Myrtle Jean and Clara... and the little baby Harris out there on the sidewalk by the cafe, just a-cryin'. Just a little bit. Try one. Ooh, yeah. Mmm. That's good. See that? And to think... I was the big shot who was gonna change her life. You're not the only one. But you did. Didn't you know? You were the first. The first what? To need her. Chicka, chicka, chickabee. Chicka, chicka, chickabee. T'ee an me an t'ee an me. Thee and me and thee and me. Reesa, reesa, reesa me. Reesa, reesa, reesa me. Chicka, chicka, chickabee. Chicka, chicka, chickabee. You remember that. Whee!
