Elther brother! I remember... My brother's friends stopped by our house. - It was already summer break. - How about this? Very pretty? They were all handsome And they read my cartoons. They took me together. And I sang for them. I was very shy - In our class... - What? I'm... I'm the best singer of KIM Choo-ja's song. - You say... - I'm serious. Should I do? OK. Do it. I wonder what happens at home. When nobody's there. The empty kitchen is pretty lonely. The corner I used to sit on... My favorite spot... How sad it must be without me. The wooden floor warn shiny and smooth... I wonder if it misses me. 14101 arrests in Seoul and 4500 in Pusan. This accounts for 61% of the roundup. In custody are 629 members of 71 gangs and 546ring leaders from 14 organizations. With a tatto you're a criminal. - Really? - Buddy you got to be careful. If you even look at a soldier you're arrested. Arrest a bold man like the president? Even teachers are jailed. People who welsh on their debts? Whose play is it? I'm confuse Let's change the channel. It's too distrocting. I got the Queen! If I get borny, whose fault is it? It's been a long time. I get out of home for one month Get out! You... You're always sleeping... as if you were home. Get out! Get out of here! Get out! Get out! Get out of here! Where are you going? Where? Where? Where! Where are you going? Drink! Drink! No one knew how the girl got to Okpo. People said they saw a girl near the Kum River. But no proof that it was her. I saw a girl who looks like her... where? I wonder if it's her? She's small and skinny. With crooked feeth. # She's crazy. She's loony. # She's crazy. She's loony. # She's crazy. Let's take her bundle. # She's crazy. You brats! Get out of here! Maybe I fed you too much. You'll be alright. You've got to eat. How is she? Can you look after her for a few days? That's the only thing to do. She'll end up a corpse anyway, if we don't. She speaks sometimes. Maybe if she gets some food, she'll remember where she lives. What kind of parents would desert their child like this! On that first night... and till the next morning she just slept. But she had bad dreams She kept flailing her arms. At times I saw the white of her eyes. For the 5 or 6 days after that she was okey. She did my errands, washed the dishes. She broke a few dishes... but not more than 5 or 6. For someone not well, she did a good job. Pitiful creature! This legs is very slim It's like actress. You're crazy? Do you think of her as a woman? A week after she got here, she changed. She looked out of sorts, different. Hue~ What are you looking at? Get back in your corner. For God's sake, brush your teeth. Are they gold or what? Brush them! Brush! Brush! Do you know her? What? What's he saying? He says "You're crazy". Get out! I'm the best singer of KIM Choo-ja's song. You say... - I'm serious. Should I do? - OK. Do it. She didn't go to Jang Hang. Our guess that she followed the workers was wrong. We went back to Okpo to the restaurant where she stayed. # I have a bruise! OK. Fuck! Hey! Who are you? Speak to me! Now! Hurry up! Now! Speak to me! Now! Speak to me! Now! - - Elder brother, brother... Elder brother, brother... Elder brother, brother... - Am I brother? Dammit! I'm not your brother! Dammit! Who'll wear it? Your wife? - Your daughter? - Yes. How old? Maybe 15... It's the latest fashion. ...or is she 19? Asshole! He doesn't even know his daughter's age! Who'll wear it? Put in the bean curd. The onions... but... kids don't like onions You like eggs... Put in the eggs What's up? Are you sick? Why are you looking for her? She's the sister of a friend. It takes such a big group? Where are her brother and parents? Are they, dead? Yes... Who is Kim Sang Tae? Well, he is sort of... He is the nephew of some rich guy. Because of the lady Okpo, I am losing a day's wages. Does this guy know how to drive? Have you seen this girl? Nope There are people who saw you taking her to the hospital. No, not me. Are you going to buy that? Looks like a picture of a school trip. I think... this is a great song A while ago. A strange rumour circulated... that here in this cottage, some time ago a girl moved in. The rumour was that... countless local men slept with her. One story was that she was very young. While other stories had her... as a middle-aged woman. She was here. She like a beggar! Her entire body was covered in bruises. The smell was horrible I thought she must be dead. She is dead! If her finger had not moved slightly, I would have just gone. She kind of scared me. I felt such a sense of shame because she was a human being just like me. She has a strange will to live. On her back and wast were traces of bruises. It's Amazing. The bruises were old. How did she survive? Another amazing thing... She hadn't eaten for a long time but now she's almost back normal. Don't worry. You took her to hospital. Mustn't have been easy. My... My girl was so young and dead before become adult. But, word had been spreaded in town I was blamed to let her die and a little girls in village were afraid of me. They believed that I had a special poison to make little girls die... As time went by, memories of my dead girl fiend were so strong I thought of die I went through hell. Now... i hardly get over it oven though I try to bury the past in my he I don't know... if she was listening to my story or not. I'm not sure if she understood what I was talking about. But, my gut feeling is that she knew. When I asked her "Where are you from?" Mommy was shot and tried to find my brother. She replied She understanded me. How did her brother die? The one she was searching for? An accident in the army. You believe that? He was forced into the army. What do you mean? Forced? He was forced into the army because he demonstrated. Where might she have gone? Isn't that important now? I don't have any idea. I got a call from the nurse, but she'd left when I arrived. I hung around Daechun Station and the bus terminal. For a while... I thought that my dead girl friend had come back to me. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
