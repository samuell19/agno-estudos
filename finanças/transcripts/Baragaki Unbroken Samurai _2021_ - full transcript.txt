Mr. Yong and I have both killed a lot of people We wouldn't have killed so many people without the Shinsengumi Young Aizu feudal lord Katamori Matsudaira moved to Tokyo in an unprecedented manner. There will be no new groups in the world Guardian of Kyoto After the death of Naobi Ii, the important minister of the founding faction Matsudaira Chungaku Appointed as the new chief executive of the shogunate (See the post after the general: refers to the position of the general who assists the current general when he is a minor) The 15th-generation general, Mr. Kiichi Hashimoto, took office after he was appointed general. The guardian of Kyoto is a new official position to govern Kyoto The ronin who shouted for the king and the barbarians ran rampant at the feet of the emperor Also beheaded people close to the shogunate or founding dignitaries If killed, his head will be placed on the Kamogawa beach There is a guilt sign next to it This is the one who is condemned madness Ronin will break into merchant's house at night to rob Threatened to kill foreigners, let the merchants pay and spend the money they robbed The famous night market has never been opened for this reason. It is the Choshu clan who is behind all this. Changzhou tried to win over the ministers to support the court plan to establish a government in Kyoto Both the prince and the emperor are planted in money The nobles of the Tokugawa family have not been involved in the vulgar world of politics for 300 years I am a person who has inherited the blood of the god-kun Ieyasu. These two should be thinking that if they want to step into the quagmire Then bring a few more people together My domain is located in a remote part of Oshu The retainers are stubbornly stubborn and do not understand the situation in Kyoto - Temperament also... - The situation took a turn for the worse. Aizu-sama, please accept the appointment I hope you can become the guardian of the royal city This caused chaos in the Aizu Domain (National elders: family elders who stay in the domain of the feudal lord have a higher status than ordinary elders) The national leader led several people to Edo on fast horses persuade the lord to change his mind I can't accept the shogunate's proposal. If I accept my clan, it will perish. Let's go to Aizu with the determination to die with Kyoto as a battlefield. This is all I have to say The king and ministers embrace each other and cry loudly Because the family motto of the Aizu domain is for the general to put life and death aside On December 24, 1862, the Aizu Army entered Beijing Citizens have put their hearts down and the famous night market has reopened Guanbai Guards Mansion After the arrival of Lord Rong Bao, he immediately began to work in the court. This is the time engraved on the incense timer Things are really complicated in Kyoto After Ieyasu-kun, the ministers are obviously alive But you can only have the treasures that have been accumulated with great difficulty it's not fair I want to make a profit and lend my house to a city gambler to open a casino Only the official position is far above the great names That's the source of the commotion I heard that the ministers who are close to the Changzhou domain can't stand it anymore. Those ministers who were pro-Changzhou even falsely passed on imperial edicts Tell the king to fight against foreigners and say that this is the will of the emperor Caused the commotion of the patriots, but the emperor didn't know it This is too stupid Lord of Satsuma and Lord of Choshu They must have never been to this temple. The minister is terrified The second day of the first month of the second year of the change of years The daimyo were allowed to meet the Emperor Xiaoming Left Guard Lieutenant General Yuan Rongbao has an audience Give him my robe 3 days later, after becoming a general, His Excellency Kiichihashi came to Nijo Castle He was stationed in Kyoto in charge of diplomacy between the generals and the imperial court It's good to see the emperor, but... The curse has intensified Are you being too lenient with the barbarians? As a guardian, I think it should be widely spoken Could it be that you plan to talk to the activists in Tosa, Satsuma Choshu? I will convince them myself persuade? The guards of the royal city should use their troops to drive out the dangerous elements Do you think Aizu can do it? actually actually The task I'm waiting for is only to strengthen the city's vigilance Do not meet with dangerous elements Catching criminals, a 300-year-old practice, has become impropriety I can't take this breath of Aizu Domain's inappropriate job. The day when General Kamao goes to Beijing is approaching - Choose a person with superb swordsmanship in the practice... -The local practice is afraid of the rogue Only dare to come out and pick up the body afterwards We have the strongest samurai There are four or five hundred radical ronin in Kyoto If we tightened the controls, they killed them at the same time may cause chaos Then what should I do Same as assassinating Mr. Ii Let the warriors with superb swordsman leave the domain to form an assassination unit This is not the style of the Aizu Domain In this way, you don't have to ask whether the other party is from Langshi City or the common people. Hire only competent people It's so messy it's unreasonable If you don't want to do so, then tell Mr. Qingxi - wait a minute We were still living in Edo at the time Whether measles or cholera is due to not waiting for the emperor's order The shogunate listened to the foreigners and opened the port You and Mr. Shannan have the same opinion. People who study the best Beichen Yidao Liu in the world think so I think ideas have nothing to do with genre The atmosphere always feels weird we are surrounded Their goal is me, you don't shoot Even if you say so... year three We're here to avenge Mr. Liuche, right? Then we'll be one-on-one you thorn Are you going to fight me - just use that thing in your hand Chief - I don't want I'll go buy a new one later I'm here to avenge my uncle, I won't make excuses But I want to seriously fight with you you go buy the right knife I'm going to go to Kyoto as soon as possible Just came to say hello to old acquaintance Mr. Hijikata See you in the King City in the future next hello watch out If this goes on, the dojo will close down. The number of disciples is decreasing, but the number of professors is increasing The main house also got smaller - good I'm just here to ask what you're going to do in the future - okay From now on, you will sleep, eat and practice at the dojo The main house will be my practice place from now on It's almost time for us to leave for Kyoto together. no money - borrow Go to Kyoto must have the matching sword Mr. Hijikata Yup I heard that the shogunate was going to convene a troupe of rogues to go to Kyoto. As a Yamato Samurai To be the vanguard of expelling foreign enemies and resolutely resisting foreigners Please sign up actively to sweep away the disappointment of the weekdays It doesn't look good like this New eight-where does it look bad The shogunate was to manage the ronin who were bent on fighting against foreigners Just pulled out Aizu-sama - Hijikata This recruitment is because I and Todo's classmates Mr. Hachiro Kiyokawa's proposal was put into action by the shogunate Not surprising Ah Sui, didn't you say you wanted to go to Kyoto? Then what are you going to do? no no no all the same Shannan come and tell me in detail - ok drink it no i don't drink It's okay to have a drink today - Mr. Yuan One person pays 50 liang to settle down, as expected of the shogunate. It all depends on Mr. Qinghe's people. If you go to Kyoto, it will be a battlefield I ask for a famous knife even if I spend all my settlement expenses That would be none other than Huche. Is Hu Che so good? congratulations congratulations congratulations If elected as one of the Langs That would be like half a foot into the ranks of the samurai Here are 30 knives, pick the one you like and take it with you What's wrong I want a famous sword at the level of a daimyo saber Say something unreal Toru Kondo - Ayong leads Tiger Toru... - Going to Kyoto to do things is to rely on skills and swords to decide life and death I want to bring a famous sword that is comparable to Hu Toru How much will it cost - 100 taels A servant's salary is only 3 taels a year Is it enough for your brother-in-law to give you 50-50 taels? I give 50 taels Remember your sister's kindness I heard that you have Izumi Kanesada in your family can you tell the difference If the sword can be seen clearly, it will be more dangerous I want it for the second generation What about the 1st and 3rd gen - not too mediocre Where did you hear about Maruju's name? I ran ten and they all said that Rusted - for three hundred years in deep sleep in a warehouse in the mountains How much Five taels - too cheap If it is polished and polished, it is worth a hundred taels why five taels The sword has its own destiny This knife has been wanting to meet you for hundreds of years That's why you can be pulled from the scabbard so easily This is what I have seen. Five taels is enough. Please help me find a sharpener - I'd be more than happy Will you wake up after three hundred years of sleep? The rogues traveled one hundred and thirty miles Arrived in Kyoto on the evening of February 23, 1863 (Note: This poem is "Song of Righteousness" by Toko Fujita) The atmosphere of heaven and earth is pure Zhong Shenzhou Xiuwei Fujidake Outstanding among the assembled team members It was Kamo Serizawa, who was born in the Mito Tengu Party, and the four they sent. He said that the chief was very much like his dead brother So hold on and refuse to let go The eight of us Kondo sent are the treatment of ordinary team members The fish is also carefully cooked - yes (Countryman: He is usually engaged in farming and joins the army in wartime) We are the local people of Kyoto The Yagi family who is respected as a villager in Roshi Mibu Village Why should you take care of those vulgar people from Kanto? Not only our family is the same It is the duty of the people of Mibu Village to help the general. No complaints - I'm so sorry As expected of the emperor's feet A pickle is also so delicate I feel more and more that our Kanto is a wild land Wilderness is also good when is it now Is this time convenient? really dirty where did you get this stuff The farewell gift from Mr. Jue'an - let me see excuse me Someone is looking for Mr. Kondo Saito, you are here Todo, this is your first time seeing each other - yes (Flag book: In the Edo period, it specifically refers to those who have less than 10,000 stone in the territory of the samurai directly under the generals but have the qualifications to meet the generals) This is Saitoichi who fled after beheading Hamoto in Edo Please let me join this time too - fine fine Pray for the gods to save us and the loners from the pain I hope to chat with you Why did the blue blood of my generation flow? What does bloody mean? Blood shed for loyalty be quiet - i believe You are all warriors not afraid of bloodshed But if you bleed for the wrong path will bear an indelible stigma I'm waiting to form an alliance with the Waves Said to be the escort of the 14th-generation General Shigeru who recently entered Beijing. But that's just an excuse The emperor hates the barbarians Therefore, I am very opposed to the shogunate's policy of opening the port. Why don't I wait for the Langshi group to uphold this righteousness To be a pioneer it is good We don't eat Tokugawa's salary Can freely choose to advance or retreat So we should act as soldiers of the court If the important members of the shogunate want to deviate from the intention of the court Kill and give up After Qinghe released these words, the shogun's vassals left. My offer will certainly greatly promote the prestige of the court So from today onwards, I, Qinghe, will take up the post of Minister Put the thoughts of the Langshi group on the emperor Do you have any objection He's such a bad guy Great Traitor It's so high-sounding on the lips, it's already rotten on the inside kill him Eh? have you ever killed someone have it It seems not You haven't killed yet, have you? Not killed you boy It's time to change your way of walking like a hillbilly Have it Should be like a samurai, right? This is Kyoto If only killing Qinghe would not solve the fundamental problem Let's build a new party There are only 9 of us La Cinze Duck joins he's an alcoholic I heard from the chief Duck Serizawa works at the Kyoto mansion of the Mito Tokugawa family The position is the public side - good skills And he also has a good relationship with the public side of Mitsuhiro Rongbao-sama That is to say We will report the idea of ​​establishing a new party through Serizawa Let the guardians of Kyoto help us good idea I say Can you stop calling me "A Sui"? why ah, is it bad? In the future, please call me Tufang In the future, please call me Tufang I'm not that thorn anymore If you wish, then as you wish Hijikata Hijikata nice Is it to worship the guardian deity? Isn't there a fox cave at the guardhouse of the Hino Inn? really Those foxes are very smart how do I say this There is a shop called Hannoya far from the hotel. they sometimes go there to buy wine Pay well every time Pay with leaves you think so too But they pay for genuine Tongbao with patina I like this Mr. Yuan By the way, do you want to listen to me tell the story of Kappa? I do not want to hear The Serizawa faction lived in the main house with a large eaves We live in the Datong shop in another courtyard. If he persuades us to drink, I'll drink it no perform well You ask me what I think of Qinghe? Yes I will kill that traitor new see It's because I don't kill him The dark and windy night broke into his bedroom No matter the three seven twenty one cut it first Mr. Duck is really a hero it's not worth it What? I have a suggestion for your Excellency after killing him To be the first national scholar in Kyoto The No. 1 Kokusai in Kyoto Serizawa through his big brother He made a request to the guardian of Kyoto to kill the traitor Qinghe. The next day, the public servant of the Aizu Domain, Jibei Ojima, said that he must see us. Drive away all the ships from America what do you think of them are first class What if you have to be divided? Serizawa-sama must be the strongest one But the most dreaded here is Mr. Tufang His cat-like movement was done with effort no flaws then let them try Let's talk to the chief. Just the four of us Qinghe is waiting for the emperor's life Every day I go to the Academy to give lectures to young ministers Even if the road you walk is different every day But there is one place that he must go through Assassination takes place at night If the Qinghe passes by here before sunset, then do not move. Requires one hit kill If you fail, run away immediately Kondo and Shinmi, Me and Serizawa take action in shifts I should have died in the change outside the Sakurada gate Because I blackmail and kill all evil so excluded from action coming I will take Qinghe's life be sure to kill Okay, earthwork be sure to kill I see I will deal with his disciple give it to you don't shout It's so long-winded, Mr. wait for my instructions this fool why shout it's your fault I don't understand what you're saying If I beat it just now, I will definitely be able to take the Qinghe head. That's your delusion Where is the illusion tell me the story One hit kill is our strategy But you didn't wait for my instructions... You are crazy about strategy lack of guts exactly what I want Since it's you who picks things up, don't blame me for being rude so far stop fighting It's the earth's fault Okita, are you alright? You two are running so fast I can barely catch up That cough doesn't sound good Although the assassination failed But we got the office A total of 14 people including Serizawa duck Kondo Isamu and his subordinates The Mibu Rami who appointed you as the guardian of Kyoto I hope you and the Aizu Domain will work together Guard the King City together Please help me too Hachiro Kiyokawa was ordered by the emperor to go to Edo was assassinated there We've killed a lot of disgusting rogues to become samurai Killed some people who could not have been killed It was also at that time that we imitated the Western military system and introduced the squadron organization Several shogunate samurai were familiar with this way Establish a system that maintains the vassal The largest army in the royal city that incorporates Western thinking That's our goal Even to keep Mr. Kondo away from Mr. Serizawa We need this kind of western reform too In my hometown, I have always been running a business of trial knives. There are methods such as stick testing, chopping hard objects, water hitting test, etc. Hit the water? -yes To hit the water is to hit the surface of the water with the blade like this If the blade is not strong enough, it will break Therefore, Mito's swordsmiths will put a lot of effort into it. Although I know he is obliged to write letters to the big men and ladies in the village But are these two getting too close? Mr. Serizawa is very knowledgeable about the Mito Domain. yes? Will Mr. Kondo just become the Mito Tengu Party? It's amazing, I bought my neighbor's house too. Mr. Kondo said that Odori's room looked bad Help, am I help? It is called "Officer" in Dutch. Orpheus? -Officer. Oheser-Officer. Officer. I usually handle affairs as the captain's assistant. In actual combat, he will be the leader of the squad to command the battle. and can assist from outside the camp Hence the name "Assistant" The top director is Serizawa Kondo Shinmi Strange that there is no Mr. Hijikata's name in it. It's surprising. Mr. Shannan and I are vice-presidents Although the "detention" of anti-Ilonians has decreased However, the "seizure" of property belonging to Serizawa's faction is not uncommon. 200 two They broke into the merchant's home to extort money - 300 taels If resisted, they will even bring out the threat of artillery please go back It's even more dissolute to women Even the cannons are out. What are you doing? what what are you going to do come soon sorry hey - please stop Below is Heyue Above is the sun star - I don't want it don't want I got it, got it, wait a minute Can city folks join? The director and I both come from the common people what's your name Soo Yamazaki is the son of an acupuncturist at Koryobashi, Osaka what are you good at stare at the candle I am not a candle I'm sorry, but I'm best at making money Most of my father's patients were from wealthy businessmen. So the information on the rich is clear Such rich people would lend me money Rich people like that won't lend me money But if you look at it from the point of view of the rich People who are stingy with borrowing money will not become rich This time I'll go around it I, Yamazaki, promote the business process and everything goes smoothly and win-win I can also borrow money from it. When our team needs money, I can raise money in Osaka So do you want to bring me in? Next Are you two cousins? I was the first to join the team, this guy came with me But first I said that I wanted to be a samurai Whoever comes first - come on I came first, Mr. Yuan - you came first Are you writing poetry again? Eh, the law in the game? It's team discipline Must not violate the spirit of Bushido what is this For example, if you hurt the enemy but fail to take the opponent's life and let the opponent escape Or turn your back to the enemy As a team member, you must defeat the enemy as long as your sword is unsheathed. If you violate it - cut your own belly and commit suicide It's too harsh I'm afraid I'm going to scare off the players. It also has to commit suicide Article 2 It is not allowed to leave the team without permission Article 3 Don't raise money privately - commit suicide Article 4 Do not accept lawsuits without permission - commit suicide Prohibiting private fights is bound to be a suicide Is this too harsh? The spirit of Bushido is sublime and cannot be violated Zhengfan one piece around the pot The bright moon does not return to Shen Bihai The white cloud is full of melancholy where is Chief Serizawa how about raising money Most of the team members from Edo wore cotton-padded clothes It's time to switch to summer clothes Is it blackmail again? It's ugly Every time I receive the favor of the Marquis of Aizu Mito's gang will feel ashamed Okura and Arakida are so nice dare not - dare not I'm going to have a meeting of directors In the game, I narrowed it down to five That's almost it Okura and Arakida are spies sent by Choshu Are you going to kill them? sooner or later This is sent by the adults of the outer island from the public side, let us return it to others Serizawa extorted 200 taels from Hongchi It reached the ears of Marquis Aizu ashamed Konike was a wealthy merchant who ruled over the merchants in Osaka. I'm going to apologize to him for the future I go with you too This is my job I heard you extorted a lot of money from famous merchants What's wrong with extortion This is what those ronin would do under the banner of respecting the king and fighting barbarians. The leader of the team is not Serizawa-sama, but Bushido This statement is not quite right Kondo. Kondo, what is Bushido that you speak of? Bushido is Bushido Maybe you don't know about it because you came from a family of common people in Tama. The Mito Domain also had its own Bushido new see We were taught the essence of Mito Bushido since childhood. The Choshu Domain has Satsuma Domain and Aizu Domain as well As a samurai, you should die for your master This is Bushido So who is the leader of this team? The leader of our team is Bushido Not to mention that people have shallow eyelids Without the lord, how can we talk about Bushido Why do we need to strictly abide by Bushido if we don't have a master? You should listen to it Defend Bushido for your abandoned Bushido Create a system to maintain the vassal The Bushido that borrowed the organizational system of the Western army This is the Bushido of our Shinsengumi New team? When I returned the 200 taels you blackmailed Hongchi to him he said to me You are the ones chosen by the times, choose your new Bushido the new group I am enlightened after hearing this Hey There are only geisha in this house, but there are no chores at Omi Chaya. what kind of system I'm so sorry I'm so sorry Call the shopkeeper to the shopkeeper I'm going to close your Omi Chaya for 7 days Hijikata Shinsengumi is a good name, so I decided on this. Don't think about killing the enemy with a knife Use the body to kill the enemy use the body continue without rest Hit it, hit it Use the body to kill the enemy use the body Injured people will use Ishida powder collection - stop what's with that coat It is the uniform of the Shinsengumi This dress is too embarrassing Isn't it nice to feel like Ako Yoshihide? Those who want to wear can wear it, those who don't want to wear can not wear it This can't be done. This is Director Serizawa's idea. Organizational rules, uniforms and other rules in the team All need to be proposed by me or Shannan as the vice-chairman. And won the approval of the three directors Then I will apply for the guardianship of Kyoto Did you forget this order? I don't have a proposal to make a uniform yet Then come on continue Yes Yes kill the enemy with the body This Tang paper is exquisite but not as beautiful as Axue. She is a painter Call her for help when she's too busy The earthworkers from the Shinsengumi are here Shinpachi is left to you here Chief, let's go check him out for me There are two puzzles One is Serizawa Duck Because of fear of Serizawa's atrocities Recently, the number of people in Gion Shimabara has decreased a lot. We will take this matter seriously When the time is right, don't be merciless So what's the other conundrum? His Majesty the Emperor what Take advantage of the Choshu Domain, which His Majesty hates foreign countries There are also radical ministers who were prosecuted by Changzhou Your Majesty, you keep saying Then don't just talk about it The general must be ordered to do it The imperial court has now become a hall of words for the ministers sent by Changzhou Guan Bai, who was close to the Satsuma domain, was dismissed from office Your Majesty is in a difficult situation His Majesty gave the edict edict? It's a letter written by His Majesty.

Or use this "Horikawa Kunihiro" straight into your heart? Noguchi, I'll go with you seppuku seppuku,,, I hid for several days in the Aizu Domain's base camp, pretending to be discussing Of course, Serizawa is very sad. He and Shinmi have known each other since childhood. Just like my relationship with Mr. Kondo The biggest difference is Serizawa seals sadness with alcohol and women I can't forgive, I can't forgive Hijikata I'll also let the cut-throat belly come and dance. next It was the era of me, you, and Okita chopped up the earth Mrs. Xiaomei is here Are you here?

Not yet Those guys attacked Serizawa's faction so scary so scary This is to avenge Director Serizawa to let you know how powerful This sleeve is different This is Kondo I am this this is me "Knowing is confusing, but not knowing is not the road of love" Hey Mr. Osawa, it's so nice of you to be so leisurely. Leisurely? Leisurely leisurely - leisurely Is it the Changzhou dialect? Yes please be wrong (Note: Refers to decapitation for suicide by caesarean section.) not yet This guy bit his tongue and killed himself carry away - yes Didn't you say the punishment is pending? Injured in a private duel in the city and let the other party escape According to the law in the game, the abdomen should be cut Can also be forgiven according to the situation The place where he was beheaded was the woman's home The Shinsengumi was originally a mob of Mr. Shannan If you relax a little bit, it will be a mess of loose sand at any time Do you know when it will be a mess of loose sand? When you, the deputy chief, become cold-blooded If as the deputy chief, I imagine you to be a good person Difficult orders will come out of Kondo's mouth Naturally... Hatred will concentrate on Kondo, lose the trust of the team members and become a mess Samurai in Japan are not good looking The new group is different Today, Rongbaohou Songping personally awarded us the flag Eliminate the ronin with a mighty division under the banner of sincerity Guarding the peace of the court is what he taught us I hope you will remember that the roads and roads in Wangcheng are the battlefields of the Shinsengumi. Yes dissolution Hijikata If you look at the edge of the glasses Which is bigger between Mr. Shannan's eyes and Mr. Shannan's glasses? bigger glasses Shannan investigated the details of the woman is a strange woman name is snow do you know her deceased husband no need to know That can't be done, since she's the vice-chairman of the Shinsengumi group. Mrs. Snow used to be the wife of the Kyoto practitioners (Note: Pursuit Office, equivalent to the current municipal government agency, is called the Municipal Office in modern times; Tongxin, refers to the police) Followed her husband to the Kyoto Institute... Mrs. Snow came to Kyoto because she wanted to learn Shijo Maruyama school painting. Not because of a good relationship Reckless man, this is what you think The reason why I didn't return to Edo after my husband died was because Her natal family is the official of the Kuanyong Temple, and the income is very good. What's wrong with living as long as you continue to pay living expenses Her husband is a dog from Changzhou was killed by a colleague It's so nice today - yeah very hot be careful next please be careful After cooking the radishes, I'm going to Honganji Temple to do the cleaning I like snow the most in the scenery of the twelfth lunar month in Kyoto I stared at you for a day Your husband seems to have been the dog of Changzhou You may also be in touch with Changzhou start painting the end of the world Atonement for husband see the remains of the husband what do you think i think It is precisely because I think he is stupid that I put my love on the apocalyptic paintings Winter cherry blossoms are like dyed snow every moonlit night I don't want to get dirty with this Haori inspection. Just be casual. whatever you want - ok well oh i'm so happy The Wisdom of Chief Shannan Vice-Chancellor's Courage With these two generals assisting me, and Miyoshitafu by my side (Note: Taifu, who has a higher status in "Kabuki".) I almost have to say goodbye Just a mascot No command over team members and vice-presidents Organization, like swordsmanship, must be a little more sensitive There is only one deputy chief in the command system, just one person The system of the shogunate and the clan since ancient times No matter what position it is, there will be several people It was the Shinsengumi who had no trouble getting rid of that dross. You are integrated into too many Western military systems. It's not like Shinsengumi not like japanese boys This is Dawenri's banquet, two adults. keep on keep on keep on Ah, come back Shannan... Pour down the bar You don't seem to have seen Mrs. Xue again. It's not your turn to care don't get me why Mrs. Xue asked me to pass a message Send a message? what words She said she wanted to see you tonight did she really say that As far as I know it is "as far as I know"? walk around here After seeing me, I saluted and ran away What kind of message is that? It's cruel to let Mrs. Xue wait for you What do you know I still know that women in Kyoto have a good eye for people, but their character is not good. Mrs. Snow is from Edo, Mr. Hijikata, you... It is "the road of love that is confusing if you know what you don't know" Even so I can't be ashamed to see her why The way I live will make women unhappy I hate the way you look down on women Mrs. Xue cherishes the time spent with you hurry up hurry up close the door Kyoto women have good eyes but bad character Nonetheless actually Depends on how the man on the other side is It's my native please come in I'm here to apologize Just now, I asked Okita to send you a message Did you send me a message?

Well that's good uprising this month Will take advantage of the strong wind to set fire to all parts of Kyoto to kill the guardian of Kyoto At the same time, he rushed into the palace, kidnapped the emperor and took him to Changzhou. What are you thinking about the Arabian Nights? The leader is Higo's Miyabe Dingzo Gui in Changzhou He said "the time has not come", very cautious What is the total number of insurgent groups?

I'm tired of being a spy and want to become a regular member as soon as possible Director General Didn't Zuanosuke say don't kill him? already killed Hayataro - yes found it where is the palace Are there other hiding places for weapons and ammunition? Gu Gao is stubborn and refuses to speak how are you over there meeting place on letter A small hotel between Gion and Sanjo in Shimamuraya Izutsu It is also consistent with our exploration results The palace is in that area Let's go and search tonight Yes Is it Yayasan today?

Gui hasn't come yet, let's have a drink Hey boss, we're almost ready to start OK Let's have a seat OK it's time for a seat - ok borrow it - ok Vice-President-Yitong I was found out by those guys from Tosa and couldn't see Yamazaki It's alright to get dressed. no new information So please sit face to face We're here to prepare the seats Awaited Ah Ju, come and put away everyone's saber carefully-Okay Please leave it to us for safekeeping Sorry, we'll take care of it the music stopped I'll go head to head Let's go, Mr. Hijikata It's unclear if Ikedaya is really their home base or just a trap base camp for sure Todo I will bring people over to Ikedaya Listen, we're splitting into two The director leads Okita Yongkura Todo Sonosuke Takeda Nitta, Asano Hayataro and ten members of Ouzawa You go to Ikedaya the rest come with me The hotels and taverns along the road, let's go north to check each one Yes! Good work - thank you Then I'll go back first Even if Gu Gao is tortured and tortured, he should not let go. But this matter needs to be discussed about the aftermath. That is to say, should we go ahead as planned, right? Do it! Do it! But we can't just leave Gugao alone. Qili and I both came with the consciousness of fighting to the death tonight. Raid the Shinsengumi's station Whoever killed them all set fire to the house Googol is an ally and must save him Mr. Gui has repeatedly told us not to act rashly Mr. Gui is against the uprising. No prospects! That's right! Our Sakamoto Ryoma also disagrees with this. You can't talk nonsense! The road to recovery is still very long We will die on this road and more will die But Mr. Katsura and Mr. Sakamoto will carry this will to fulfill the righteousness 27 people including Miyabe Dingzo They are all planning to rescue Gu Gao on the second floor I've opened the door and the back door The earthworkers are searching along the road, go and inform them Wait a moment Who will take us to recognize the palace when he's gone?

That's right Repelling foreigners is important, but the shogunate is more important A thorn that grows in the territory directly under the general's control After implementing the road of thorns, there is a new selection group We will continue to do so in the future Aya water is coming Thanks for the help with the cotton cloth - ok There aren't enough people here, you need to call someone else quick who are you looking for What about Mr. Okita? Is Mr. Okita okay? The seriously injured are all carried here. There is no Mr. Okita among them. What about Mr. Kondo? I went with Mr. Gen. to the Aizu domain and Kuwana domain of the Kyoto Shodai. Can Todo be saved? Although his forehead was broken, his life is safe Deputy Chief of Earthworks? Feel sorry 45 days after the Ikedaya incident The war with Changzhou begins It was the engagement of July 19, 1864, right? Battle of the Clam Gate Shinsengumi was dispatched to Fushimi Basically they are chasing the enemy and there is no big battle end of that year The battle that split the Shinsengumi began i got the chrysanthemum text Does Mr. Okita want to eat? No need I'll take a look here - Huh? I have a small appetite and like to watch other people eat deliciously I especially like the way Mr. Hijikata eats what's the matter with you Kennosuke Shiori, whose wrist was chopped off by you Escaped from prison when he was about to be executed Is that all there is to it? I might meet him somewhere else. Is there anything else besides that? Mr. Ito and his party from Edo have arrived at Mr. Kondo's residence Is it finally here? Yeah join a bunch of awesome guys Shannan and Tengtang passed by immediately, right? you know After all, they belong to the same family as Beichen. But this news came to me to let me know I'm the one who came to know you They asked me to call you Idiot, you said it earlier Because I'd love to see how you change your face really Can you go right now? I won't go - sure enough Don't say that, get ready Something is wrong with the director recently, right? really Something has gone wrong since I went to Edo to recruit members in September. It seems that I met Laozhong in Edo (Old middle school: The title of the Edo shogunate is roughly equivalent to that of the Kamakura shogunate or the director of the Muromachi shogunate) After returning, as a member of the daimyo travel entourage Go to Nijo Castle every three days Discuss the world situation Do you want Mr. Hijikata to be a daimyo? not Say it again in your native language don't want to I would like to hear more of your native language I am a craftsman no matter how the world I just want to train the Shinsengumi to be the best fighting existence in Japan Are you disappointed in me I feel relieved Then the native said The palace is the battlefield It was said during the Battle of the Clam Gate - so it is I told him that Ah Sui is useless even if he chases three miles away. The deputy chief angrily said that the important battlefield cannot be without the Shinsengumi! It's a woman who wants to go back because she's worried about women I said Ah Sui, calm down and think about it The Battle of Ikedaya is praised for winning more with less But this time is different The shogunate has 40,000 Changshu only 2,000 If Changzhou is defeated, the shogunate will burn down the houses to force out the remaining soldiers The people of Kyoto will therefore prefer Choshu Our battlefield in Fushimi will not affect our reputation Mr. Kondo is really an excellent political leader It's not just Tufang who will take care of the overall situation The moon floats on the sea hare... The earthwork didn't show up till the end I'll see you at the station tomorrow What kind of person is Tufang I'm the one who contradicts everything is a fool how do I say this I don't know the dignity of kings, I don't know how terrible the barbarians are Not knowing the urgency of the times There is only Shinsengumi in this man's world All I can think about is how to strengthen the team He is a person who cannot be persuaded by reason. The most annoying thing is this idiot Compared with him, Kondo is a fighter and is easier to manipulate oath With our power, we will turn the Shinsengumi into a pure King of Diligence As expected of Mr. Hijikata He was able to raise 70,000 taels from Osaka merchants I just mediated the loan application of the Aizu Domain. I really admire you for being humble Oh earthwork do you want to be a courtier Is this a "photography" Don't you think your thoughts are a little weird lately? It is said that when a person is on the throne of honor, he gradually loses his mind. I didn't come to Kyoto to make you such a white-faced monster I get a headache every time you make fun of it in Tama dialect about to shoot please hold your breath It is said that Mr. Yoshihashi Yoshihashi likes photography Mr. Qingxi personally said that Kondo would also take a photo In other words, Mr. Kondo is now a famous name. The Ito faction isn't even here. Those people even feel that the footprints of the barbarians are not clean. If you let them see the photography, they're going to be blind It's so spacious here Ideal as a new station for the newly selected group Why is Mr. Shannan such a bitter expression? If you want to change the stagnation point, there are many options. you are not happy Nishihonganji and Choshu Domain are complicit This time the camp was moved to give them color Mr. Kondo and Mr. Ito are both fooled Living in Kyoto and forgetting about the barbarians Hijikata Toshio, who went to intimidate the monks, was extremely stupid Mr. Tufang has never talked about the rejection of foreigners We came to Kyoto to chase away foreigners what's the matter Mr. Shannan defected Imprisoned in the End of the World he lost his place lost long ago what to do According to the rules of the game, defectors should be cut to the stomach No one who defected would cut his belly Even the accommodation for tonight is clearly written down. Boss, go after you Maybe I'll let him go Did Mr. Shannan run away and come back to cut his abdomen? Keisuke Yamanami is different from us, he is a born samurai You can see the difference from the cut This is the beginning of the split Mr. Shannan, I'm going to start not yet It was January of the second year after Mr. Shannan cut his abdomen Satsuma, who has always been in dispute, hooked up with Choshu The Sakagi Alliance is a major mission for Sakamoto Ryoma-sama. In the presence of a burly man, Mr. Xixiang With the quiet and steady Mr. Katsura Kogoro Shouting "what happened to Satsuma and what happened to Changzhou" "The most important thing is Japan" So the downfall was formed At the end of the year, Mr. Yoshihashi Keiki became the 15th General The system is so outdated, it doesn't matter who is in power 20 days later, the emperor died of smallpox Some say he died of poisoning do not talk That's right Courtiers leaning towards Changzhou suddenly became smoother Then this March Mr. Koshitaro Ito was appointed as the guardian of the imperial mausoleum I left the Shinsengumi It's incredible that even Mr. Saito follows. Saito-san went there as a spy, right? to the opposite Mr. Nori Nakajima, who was investigating the movements of Choshu, returned as a regular member It's going to be a bloodbath again Mr. Kondo, as a flag, should not act rashly I'm really worried about Mr. Okita I have vomited a lot of blood this year. Where is Mr. Hijikata now? Recruiting people in Edo What about Mr. Kondo? in Nijo Castle (Return of the Great Government: In October 1876, the fifteenth general Tokugawa Keiki returned the power to the Emperor, marking the end of the Tokugawa shogunate's rule that lasted for more than 260 years) 300 Years Ago Established the Tokugawa regime for world stability Now for the sake of world stability, I have decided to give up power no more Although he renounces power, he will inherit the legacy of Duke Ieyasu If this continues, Japan will be divided If the Tokugawa family returns to power, then Japan is still a whole does not have to be a whole Probably a whole not necessarily a whole will be a whole Do you have any objection? If not, that's it Will return to power October 14, 1867 Tokugawa Keiki relinquishes the post of general returned power to the emperor I'm recruiting team members from Edo I heard the news on the way back to Kyoto At that time, there were girl flowers blooming by the roadside what's that It sounds like you're yelling, "It's fine, isn't it?" Because of the return of Dazheng, the world has become inexplicable now Mr. Source - Huh? swaying the moon take out all the knives For the shogunate at sunset Xishan The Shinsengumi is the strongest samurai group Such an organization waits there like a woodland is the most dreaded maybe so The leader personally negotiated between the shogunate and the vassal officials chattering about the world It's so ugly Get well soon sir Will do This is called vanity medicine for tuberculosis I made it at home Come I only drink it for you you are such a good man Sounds a little disgusting If I could be reincarnated I want to be as honest and sincere as you are I want to be as strong as you are Strong personality can read Sun Tzu or Wu Tzu's Art of War Live with the sole aim of defeating the enemy You pull out the chrysanthemum character and put it in front of my eyes Knife is more beautiful than any beauty But ironically This knife kills... Only Mr. Shannan The Ito faction is eyeing me This is what Saito investigated Ito can already be said to wear the same pants as Satsuma I want to gain the trust of the Fallen faction by assassinating Mr. Kondo Ready to wait Better to kill them Ito is the guardian of the imperial mausoleum If you kill the Royal Tomb Guard, you will become the enemy of the court. so what This is no different from the fact that the important officers were snatched by the Sachang Alliance. If you wait for them to call Then we are traitors Don't be fooled by politics This is a man's righteousness I've been trampled on by Ito for two years Ah Sui I gave in and fulfilled Kondo Isamu's righteousness if i don't budge he wouldn't die like that I've been thinking this way lately Don't move, it's almost finished It doesn't sound like the pen I used to use charcoal for sketching Axue's feeling is also different from before Yes Ash is going crazy soon the wilderness you live in is the place I've been looking for what did you put in your mouth nothing That is to say Axue's mouth is naturally sweet, isn't it? my husband I've always hoped that one day you could call me that Axue I've always dreamed of one day There can be a person who can call me husband husband Just ask what you want, I won't hide it Mr. Ryoma Sakamoto, who facilitated the alliance between Satsuma and Choshu, was killed I heard it was done by the Shinsengumi It's not us Sakamoto Ryoma, people with existence value three days later Mr. Koshitaro Ito was also killed in the seven oil paths that's what we do Mr. Kondo invited him to his home Ito slams the current situation and denounces the shogunate for being drunk "Green Tree Shadow" After killing Mr. Ito, you used his body as bait "Rabbits also ride the waves" This is the way of the sword warrior Hijikata brother come out faster damn you bastard The morning after the incident I went to the oil road There are fingers everywhere i'm so scared I was scared too at Ikedaya What I'm most afraid of is doing nothing and waiting So I'll help you heal going to war, right? please let me go i want to paint for you I want to paint your fighting heroism for posterity I can't involve you I'm already involved I was the one who compromised last night This time it's your turn The Shinsengumi is ready to fight Move the position to the Fushimi Shrine Is the director going to Nijo Castle today too? He is going to talk to the remaining shogunate army not yet at that stage Then you stopped him - I stopped The chief secretary is sick in bed, and most of the soldiers have fled, morale is low The reinforcements from Aizu are coming in a few days. It's really demoralizing Mr. Kondo i got shot Did Changzhou do it? Ito's remnant bring the stretcher hateful give me the knife The bone in your shoulder may be split If you hurt your bones, you won't be able to hold a sword lift up - lift up It's not enough to just return the regime. The court also asked the Tokugawa family to hand over their territory. In this way, the general and Qiben became beggars A Sui Xinxuan will be handed over to you Carry it away - yes hateful Send Chief Kondo to Osaka there is the general's imperial physician Ogata, please follow him to take care of him - okay When Nakajima went to prepare the ship, he used the special ship of the shogunate. Let the chief also get on board Captain Okita should not go Take him no matter what The guards are back He can't hold a sword anymore How many people are left in Ito's party 15 days later, January 3, 1868 The Battle of Toba Fushimi begins Mr. idiot is dangerous alright alright - hello Mr. Yuan is very dangerous, don't run around When I first met you, you were like a kappa What nonsense are you talking about Suddenly he poked his head out of the river beside the garrison With lotus leaves on his head Mr. Yuan is enough Want to hear something interesting from me? If you can kill ten enemies, I will listen to you I haven't killed anyone yet are you listening Well I already knew what, so you know But today I'm going to kill Mr. Hi Yuan Mr. Yuan Mr. Yuan Deputy Head of Earthworks - Mr. Yuan Mr. Yuan kill me Tokugawa Keiki personally led the unscathed rearguard reinforcements we won the war Are you going to fight the enemy yourself? i'm running away run away? Now hurry up and follow me to Edo why The pennant appeared Sa Changtu defected and became a member of the government army I became a traitor Stop the fight between the Aizu soldiers and the Shinsengumi In order to forcibly stop those who do not obey orders, I have to resort to this I'm going to escape to Edo and follow me How can you leave your retainers and run away alone? Have you forgotten the family motto of the Aizu Matsudaira family? The General and Lieutenant General Aizu are gone It seems to have been successfully captured not attacked I've never heard such a horrible thing Unexpectedly, the lord of the Aizu domain would abandon his domain soldiers This war is different where is the difference You don't know - what do you know of course i understand The sound of our guns is like the sound of gunfire on the opposite side of the storm, but it is sparse yeah sparse Yamazaki After waiting until Edo, you can ask famous doctors from all over the country to treat you I can't hold on to Edo anymore Bury me at sea if I die on a boat I don't want to be salted where is okita He's in the attic - quarantined I hate being salted it's me I am coming we lose The doctor told me to rest more before I lay down I'm actually healthy you stay here today There is no more general, the highest position in the world. What will happen after the new election group? Where to go sounds like a woman complaining Men only find ways to solve problems what are you going to do Even if the entire shogunate army is wiped out, only one person remains swear to defend But women also think about solutions would not Mrs. Plum Snow is still alive She comes to visit me every day Wounded soldiers may now be treated somewhere The survivors of the Shinsengumi will return to Edo on Mount Fuji Did anyone in the test house die? Mr. Yuan died If only I could hear him tell the story of Kappa i listened Only you are intact lively One day I will die in this troubled world Once they returned to Edo, the surviving members of the Shinsengumi were regarded as burdens "Don't turn Edo into a battlefield and fight elsewhere" They treat us as plague gods While waiting for Mr. Yu to recover, we decided to meet the government forces in Kofu Then I went to the Edo Aizu domain to report the matter. Only you who fought bravely in the Battle of Toba Fushimi can be called role models We will no longer be fooled by anyone Aizu Just go in the given direction Everyone, have a drink Sorry for making you all suffer - it's okay Aizu and Shinsengumi who fought bloody battles Probably will be kicked out of Edo It is in line with the usual style of Qingxi that bastard. sorry The Aizu Matsudaira family is different from other clans After the death of the feudal lord, he will not become a Buddha but become a god I inherited such a family As an adopted child, I may follow the family motto more than other people in Aizu It was because of my cowardice that I took over the role of guardian of Kyoto Of the two who escorted His Highness to Kyoto One of them, afraid of death, bowed his head respectfully Another person took a high position in the Restoration government to attack Aizu It's stupid to change identities so quickly Your Highness just wants to cowardly Deputy Chief of Earthworks When did you cut your bun Shinsengumi retreating from Kofu fights in various places From Aizu 1st road north When you meet us in Sendai your bun is gone I chose to cut the bun It was decided when he returned to his hometown to meet with the peasant team organized by his brother-in-law, Hikogoro. I got my sister to cut it My friend said to raise troops in Edo I'm going to meet them Can't go to Edo, the situation is not good Like Saito, it makes sense for them to target Aizu I'd rather go to Edo than Aizu - go if you want I can't say that, Mr. Kondo I'm not your retainer Facing Ah Sui who has cut off his bun, I no longer have the heart to fight with him Here comes the deputy chief There is a government army of about 500 people in the western forest. Brother-in-law, call the peasant team A year old, we were ordered to disband who ordered it - Mr Yong What’s wrong with you I'm going to the base camp of the government army Why go to the base camp of the government army To explain that we, as curtain ministers, will not oppose the pennant Don't worry I'll use a fake name Are you serious This is the conclusion I have come to after thinking about it for days what to end I ask you what to end I told you this war is different tell me i don't understand This war has no plans They don't necessarily want to be rebels The one who gets the pennant is the winner has been around 600 years ago... Are we going to fight for our lives according to the great principles of the ancients? That's right those so-called learned people It's just spreading an ideology that suits its own interests. Whether it is the minister of Tokugawa Qingxi who issued the imperial decree or Xixiang They're all raccoon dogs The country is easy to change, the nature is difficult to change So we can get to where we are today Don't surrender at this time. It's too ugly. The new group is created by you also built by me Just let me go and set me free I can't hold a knife in my hands, I can't even cut my abdomen Just go your own way I won't let you go take me Thank you for all these years Ah Sui Kondo was beheaded 20 days after surrender I heard that there are remnants of the Ito faction in the government army elder sister Soji, we also plan to escape to Edo My husband said he was fighting in Shonai I've cleaned your underwear for you I also said hello to the old woman in Uegiya.
