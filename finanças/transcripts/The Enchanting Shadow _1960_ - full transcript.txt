Most rooms are occupied by the army and refugees Is there any temple around? Not nearby But there's one 10 miles north, the Jinhua Temple Great, thanks But you can't stay there, sir Why not?

Where to, sir? Oh, it's you! Jinhua Temple in the north Sorry, please find another ride Why are you so... Haven't you heard? That place is haunted Whoever goes there dies.

Well then, I'll drop you off just at the front door Alright For money's sake, let's go That kid is crazy, risking his life Hey, hero Who's the keeper of the temple? It's been deserted for long, there's no keeper I wish to stay here for two days Do you mind? I'm just staying here temporarily It's better to stay in an inn Is this an unclean place? What do you mean? I heard this place is haunted Only if you believe in the stories That's right. I'm not scared of anything 've been a forthright person all my life So I'm not scared It's late, if you want to stay here You can stay upstairs in the south lodge I'd like to... I see through the vanity of life I choose to be a hermit I'm not the heroic man I used to be But on a clear night, when l... see the moon resting on a pine tree branch I remember the old days when I was heroic With a sword in my hand The earth shakes, the evil spirits are terrified Bravo Oh, it's you! You have a great voice Corrupted officials & culprits would tremble! Your swordplay can drive out the invaders I'm afraid I don't deserve such compliment Due to uprising of warlords, it's been chaotic With your martial arts skills... May I know your name? Yan Chixia You don't sound like a local I'm from Shanxi ; and your good name? Ning Caichen Mr. Ning, heading for the lmperial Exam, is it? I've studied a bit, but I'm not here for the exam I have no intention of gaining fame and fortune I'm glad to be alive in the chaos I don't ask for more Really?..he-he he-he Now it's a time of turmoil Our country needs able people Do you plan to be a hermit like myself Hiding in the mountains? Our land's been invaded by the Qing Army Deceitful kills and looting; They stop at no evil And traitors like Hong Chengchou and Wu Sangui During the Yangzhou and Jiading massacres... I heard they've killed a total of 1,900,000 innocent civilians It's a duty of all to serve and protect the country Yet my mother's old, and needs personal attention.I feel ashamed for not helping out Then you're saying... there's still hope for our country? Our territory includes provinces like Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi,Sichuan ,Lingui We've got millions in the proper army And then we have heroes all over the country Millions and millions of them We can't rule out the possible potential We have Zheng Chenggong stationed in Taiwan It's a strategic position Country defeated, home lost & the army trounced All the good and able men have sacrificed Only the troop. Have some It's late you must be weary from the journey Good idea -Goodbye -Goodbye I see you're taking a stroll in the candle light Even a shimmer from firefly can light up murky sky Then I'd appreciate this light in the dark Anything else? Have a good early sleep In the still of the night, the sky is clear Leaning on a handrail, I smell the perfumed breeze Mandarin ducks in the lotus pond make me envious I'm growing old by the passing years The full moon in the core of the sky mocks me for lying awake because of loneliness Who is it? Xiaoqian, come quick for grandma to have a look Hurry, Xiaoqian I'm coming Come, hurry and take a look at my cards She's got a good hand Don't know which one to choose This one Two strips Right, ten thousand Who were you talking to? No one No one! Obviously I hear you speak to someone I thought there was someone outside Really? What happened? You know... one of the strings broke No one should be here at this hour อาจเป็นนักศึกษาที่เดินทางไปสอบ Maybe it's some scholar passing by, staying at the east lodge He wouldn't be trespassing into our garden Or maybe our dear Xiaoqian must be man-crazy Auntie, please I think it must be a ghost A ghost? Probably Certainly it's a ghost I'm envious of Mandarin ducks playing in lotus pond The mandarin ducks living in the lotus pond Not falling asleep... insomnia Who are you? Late at night you come rushing in others' courtyard And you're discreetly here in my private chamber Have you got no manners? You look like an educated person Why are you so rude? You act like a scum Please forgive me, lady I heard you playing, and then I spotted this Truly, I got carried away Sorry about it Mandarin ducks playing in the lotus pond, living... Not falling asleep... insomnia Good amendments You are flattering me. Please pardon my rudeness And your name is, sir? Ning Caichen I'm staying at the front Mr. Ning, please excuse my bluntness You know, while composing the lyrics... I thought I could improvise on these two words Yet I couldn't think of any alternative After your amendment... Your original words are alright It's understandable But to illuminate the meaning of these... 2 characters, changes would be appropriate You're right I've not done a good job on the painting It's great, you are very talented I haven't had proper lessons Being idly bored I just casually draw Please don't laugh at my work Not at all Good, it's really great Nothing like a picture which has poetry in it You've certainly put it well But I find there's one thing amiss however What is it? It lacks a poem which has a painting in the poetry Right, a painting within a poem If you could do that honour with a stroke of your pen How can I accomplish that? Well then... Maybe my painting isn't good enough for your poem Not at all If you insist, then I will The large pond is filled with lotus leaves The lotus petals fill up the large pond The jade hairpin secretly mourns my aging The mandarin ducks taking shelter in the rain The large pond is filled with lotus leaves The jade hairpin secretly pities my passing youth The mandarin ducks taking shelter in the rain Who are you? I... What are you doing here? I... He is... Be quiet What are you doing here? Speak up You sneaked into her room at this hour Trying to seduce her, what a shameless man! Lady, you... you're indeed mistaken Oh yeah? You are but a shameless playboy You're simply an obscene rascal Get out now! Granny... Shut up Get out now! Are you asleep, Mr. Ning? Miss, you... Mr. Ning I couldn't sleep for what happened earlier Granny has bad temper, you know I hope you'll understand It's no big deal, you didn't have to come here It's my fault I sneaked into your residence at night I've caused you all the trouble But she didn't care to listen to the facts... before needlessly insulting you Yeah, at times age does that to people Well Miss, if there's nothing else... I won't keep you It's late, and if you linger on... People might gossip Please forgive my rudeness All I meant, Miss... Miss You were going to... Actually I was going to... ask you to finish this poem Since you thought I had another plan It' my fault, sorry. I'll make it up to you It's late, and if I stayed on... People might gossip Please forgive me Let me Thank you On the contrary, I should thank you The large pond is filled with lotus leaves The jade hairpin secretly mourns my aging The mandarin ducks taking shelter in the rain. I only envy the mandarin ducks but not the fairies I just envy the mandarin ducks but not the fairies Good, envy the ducks but not the fairies! I'm scared We can't be like this, you better leave We've been taught the proper manners Gossip is a fearful thing Freeze If we wake up Mr. Yan from downstairs it will make us look bad Go back to your room Don't worry, I won't tell anyone... about what happened here tonight Miss Morning, Brother Yan -Morning, where are you heading to?-To collect rent Did you sleep well? Yes, thanks Heard anything? No Seen anything? No See you later Hi...-Hi... There's a temple up ahead; Could I stay there? Oh, that... You see, because the inns are full I just want a place to put up for a few days There actually is space, you can take a look Okay, thank you Can I help you? I'm looking for someone For whom? The lady who walked in here A lady? There's no lady here And no one walked in just now I could be wrong You're Mister... I'm just looking around Please help yourself... He spoke about a young lady who walked in I told him I didn't see any girl; he didn't believe Sorry to bother you No problem... This painting... did that young lady just bring it here to mount? It's been here for over 10 years You're looking for the painter, is it? Do you know her? No, I don't But I like this painting Who painted it? She's already left this world Poor girl There once was a local governor who traveled pass this town His daughter fell sick and later died It was she who painted this In order to remember her... He took the painting here for me to mount it After the governor had to report for his job. He died soon after! Ever since then this painting has had no owner It's been hanging here for more than ten years What was the name of the governor? His surname is Nie, I think But I can't quite remember his name Then the poem there... The poem? That's strange Brother Ning Come here...Come here This is Mr. Ning Even he is staying here temporarily He just arrived yesterday This is... We've met this morning Please have a seat ช่วยด้วย..ช่วยด้วย..ช่วยด้วย Please help... Master Help What is it? A ghost! He kept running after me Bullshit! Where? Right behind..Right behind Let's see Is this your ghost? Don't be so suspicious I heard that this place is haunted That's why he got scared You're so lame. I also heard about it I didn't believe it, but now... Now what? Have you seen a ghost? No Only the fools will find their own troubles. I never fear ghost. If a beautiful girl shows up... in the middle of the night A ghost or not I'll take a chance What are you laughing at? Unpack the bags Yes, sir He's not at all sensible Where were we? You mentioned about taking a chance Right, a learned man can find a beautiful bride A learned man can find wealth For a scholar the biggest hope... is to become famous and appease the parents Also to have beautiful brides and concubines Otherwise, it would be a waste... for 10 years of studies What do you think, Mr. Ning? It's late, I better turn in Evil prevails when a country is about to fall True. Hey, I wanted to ask you Who lives in the back garden? Nobody lives at the back Hah! See you tomorrow You... What are you doing here again? Granny knows about my visit last night Got a scolding again, did ya? Not only that What then? She hit you? You'd better head back Otherwise you'll be in serious trouble No, I'm not going back I'm never going back Please take me away from here I don't care what I might need to do I can be your maid and serve you Never would that happen Why? It's all my fault If I can help with anything else I'm prepared to do it But leaving with me? I don't think so Don't you have any sympathy? Are you just going to see me suffer here? Please have pity on me Take me out of here I can take the beatings and yelling from her But I can't go against my conscience and do things I don't want to do Young Lady Please hear me out She called me a shameless playboy said that I'm trying to seduce women If you really leave with me... Then I'd be doing exactly that And I mean, it's your own family matter I can hardly be of any help If you refuse to take me with you Then I can't stay here anymore It's not convenient for me to travel with this Please take this, as my gratitude I'm just glad that we could meet No, Miss I can't accept such valuable gift This is a gift for the poem you wrote I can't accept such gifts Writings are priceless; inscribed it as gift for a friend If you won't take it back Then forgive me for being unreasonable I must throw it out You're a loyal and patriotic gentleman Some esteem is expected of a person like you It isn't you! 10 years of studies is a waste Let's go back to bed, and just mind our own When you were here earlier... You asked me a strange question I didn't mean anything by that Have you seen someone over there? No... I haven't Brother Yan You're not being honest I asked you several times You were quiet,... now you understand Don't be scared As long as you're pure-hearted Evil can never prevail over good Absolutely What are you doing here again? I want to talk to you Please get out of here Mr. Ning Maybe you've already found out the truth To be honest, l... I'm not human I'm a spirit In that case, we definitely... have nothing in common to talk about I have no intention to harm you There are some evil human beings And there're some good ghosts I'm here to save you Save me? I only know that ghosts harm humans I've never heard that they'll help humans! And I don't envisage any danger Are you just making up an excuse for my rescue? At 3 tonight, granny intends to take your life I have no grudge against her Why would she try to harm me? She has harmed countless... innocent men already Whoever stays here No one will walk out alive What about Mr. Yan downstairs? He's different, he's a swordsman The granny doesn't dare to harm him Then she really wants to harm me? She asked me to entice and seduce you Then last night, she asked me to bring you... the gold to lure you Yet you turned me away And you also declined the offered gold She didn't get a chance to harm you That's why she's in a rage she won't let you go I know that you're a good man I don't want you to die at the old devil's hands That's why I'm here to warn you Then why are you helping her in harming others? I was the daughter of a governor. I died when I was traveling here, and I was threatened by the old devil I seduce people, so she can suck up their blood I am not at all willing... to be a part of these shameless deeds Then why don't you leave her? I'm a weak soul, I can't fight against her Unless if you can help me... from sea of suffering, Otherwise I'll never be reincarnated How would you like me to help you out? Tell me. If I can do it... I will try my best During the day where you saw the crow cries I was buried underneath the white poplar tree If you don't mind, take my skeleton to my village Then I will serve you with all I can in my next life Miss, I'll comply with your wish It's already past 2 a.m. She'll be here at 3. Old witch will come to harm you Hurry downstairs And ask Mr. Yan to let you stay in his room Then you might be safe Hurry, I've to go now Brother Yan What is it? Mr. Ning Anything wrong? Nothing Have you seen something? No... I haven't You heard anything? Oh, yes... I thought I heard you calling me I called you? No That's strange! Come inside, have a drink Have you seen a ghost? You shouldn't be so superstitious Evil can never prevail over good There's no need to be afraid of ghosts Right If there're ghosts, there will be fairies With your honesty and kindness You'll be blessed Don't be afraid, go back to sleep I couldn't sleep a wink. If you don't mind... I'd like to have a good chat with you tonight It's difficult to come across a good friend And I enjoy to chat with my friends It is one of the pleasures in life Yet every morning l... Then please go ahead and sleep I... I will read a book Sure But I snore... Do you mind? Not at all All I've got here are scriptures Great, they can clear my mind You can rest when you feel tired Sure For the things in here Please leave them alone Otherwise we'll be in trouble Sure doze off then Good night Maybe it's not her time yet What, she's not dead? She's lucky to have escaped With your skills Why don't you eliminate her? Do you know that the buddhists believe in... the co-existence of Humans, Ghosts and Gods? A good man becomes a god after his death A wicked person turns into a ghost But humans can be more wicked than the ghosts At first I didn't want to... ...get involved in this But since the old devil is challenging me Then I've got you into trouble Don't worry I'll always help my friends It's no big deal The old devil is up to no good, I should take her out Yes This way at least we've helped her out a bit Who? I've got a foster sister who was buried here She's been tortured by the old devil I planned to transport her skeleton to her village and find a good site to bury her In the still of the night, the sky is clear Leaning on a handrail, I smell the fragrant breeze I'm jealous of the mandarin ducks ...in the lotus pond I'm growing old by the years The full moon in the middle of the sky mocks me for lying awake because of loneliness Thank you again for your help Please go ahead See you later Goodbye Move The large pond is filled with lotus leaves The jade hairpin secretly mourns my aging The mandarin ducks taking shelter in the rain I only envy the mandarin ducks but not the fairies Sir, the horse is scared, he won't go any further You'd have to alight the cart Anyway how far is this place from the town? Not too far I suggest you should find a place to stay here Okay Who is it? I'm just a passer by You are... Excuse me, old lady I just want to rest here, I will be gone in the morning Sure Sit here, I'll find you a blanket Thank you Excuse me.May I ask you something? Mr. Ning Mr. Ning Shut up, you brat You wretched lass After I've taken care of him Then I'll come after you Granny... Please leave him alone, at least for the sake of... I've always attended you well Won't be forgiven Granny... Let go of me Okay, some guts you've got! No one dares to harm me all these years Who do you think you are? You've got some guts harming me... And enticing my house maid You're brazenly opposing me! Now... Iet me show you what I'm made of Granny... Gramma, I request you to let go of him. Scram off, you smelly wench Hold it!
