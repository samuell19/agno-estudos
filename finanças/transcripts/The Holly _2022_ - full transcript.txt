Try not to get too many street signs, though. I've never been big on letting a bunch of people know where I stay. Come on, man. [distant chatter] He said there's a room back here where the door knob is broken. Sorry, I had to break the door in. That's how bad I want my shit, though. My photo album, Julian. Look. All these kids are grown now. Man, what you know about this, Julian? Huh? Hello? Oh, the battery's low. You know how many events we organized with this? [chuckles] For reals. This was the gun. This was the lifesaving gun. [indistinct protest] [indistinct singing] We're doing it for you, come on! [crowd cheering] Come on! [reporter] Terrance Roberts, he is with the Prodigal Son Initiative and the group helps at risk kids in Park Hill. Thank you so much, Mr. Roberts, for being with us. Thank you for having me. What about this? See, this is how you do development work right here. We ended up putting the gazebo right here. Here's the parking. Here's the Nuggets court. Lot of our kids that live over here, they're joining the street gangs, they're feeling like they don't have a voice, and right now, my heart just feels really big, and it just... I can't believe that we're getting this project done, guys. [kids cheering] [kids cheering] [Terrance] It was the perfect day. In the area in front of our building we have four coolers... I was ready to do my peace rally that morning. It was just going to be a way for us to talk about stopping the violence in the community. I encourage everybody to get out and walk through and have a tour. [reporter] We surely will. And thank you so much for continuing. - After how many years... - [repeated gunshots] Uh-oh. [frantic shouting] Um, I ended up having to shoot Hasan right around here. [operator] Denver 911. What is the address of your emergency? [man] 31st and, uh, Holly. [woman] The Boys and Girls Club. Somebody just got shot outside the club. One guy was... is... is he still laying on the ground? He's still laying on the ground. [woman 2] Oh, God. Oh, Jesus. [reporter] Former gang member turned anti-violence activist is charged with shooting a man in the parking lot of a Boys and Girls club in Park Hill. Terrance Roberts is accused of opening fire at a peace rally he organized last night. [reporter] The circumstances surrounding the, uh, shooting remain cloudy. The victim is still in critical condition tonight. [suspenseful music] [birds chirping] [phone line ringing] [Julian] Hey, Terrance, this is, uh, Julian Rubinstein calling. - [Terrance] Hey, how you doing? - [Julian] Yeah, good. - What's up, man? - [Julian] How're you doing? - Good. - All right. [Julian] When I read about this shooting inThe New York Times, I was working as an independent journalist. I'd grown up in Denver and I flew home. [indistinct chatter] [Julian] Terrance was out on bond facing attempted murder charges. But a lot of the activity is here. Now, you have different drug spots in this part of Park Hill and different killings. That's how my cousin Marla was murdered by some Montebello Bloods. [indistinct chatter] [Julian] I didn't know what to make of Terrance's case. But I was interested in what he had to say about the violence that was on the rise in this community. If I would have gotten caught anywhere in any of these thousands of blocks of city, I could have lost my life. And I still have a ton of support, but it's co-mingled with people who don't support me, who work for the police, that's why I don't trust them. [Julian] I mean, it's... You got a big city. [Julian] I had no idea that I would spend the next seven years trying to get to the bottom of this case or how tangled up in it I would become. [Terrance] This area is where a lot of the gang related and drug related homicides are happening right now. And the Holly is right here. This is where my haters and my supporters are. Go around the block. Go around the courts real quick. [Terrance groans] - [Sherri] Is that Terrance? - [Terrance] Yes, it is. [Sherri] How are you doing, love? How are you doing, love? Hey. Hi. - How are you doing? - [Sherri] Oh, I'm doing okay. We're set up here [indistinct] as offices. And we said it's a damn shame that ain't nobody been in there since you been gone. You know, this is my art right here, man. This is... This is some of my life's work. The youth center. The courts. We did this, man. You know, we built this area up. [man 2] That's Terrance Roberts right there. [Terrance] Oh, what's going on, man? How are you doing? I'm doing good. How's your dad doing? [man 2] Blew it! [all laugh] [Terrance] Come on, man! How you feel about being back over here? [Terrance] It feel good. [man 2] What you doing for the community, sir? [man 3] A whole lot more than what the fuck y'all doin'... [man 2] All you doin' is talking shit. [Terrance] How much money have you raised? [man 3] How much money have y'all raised? [Terrance] We're raising real money over here for kids. These niggas is talking and walking. You talking and walking. [man 3] What you doin' for your kids, homie? Nothing! Man, let's go, man, 'fore somebody else get popped on or something. [Sherri] Look at this grey car. They're shooting over here every day. We love you guys. Okay, I'mma be back. [Sherri speaking indistinctly] Absolutely, Sherri. God bless. [tense music playing] [reporter] Roberts has given a lot of his blood, sweat, and tears to the Park Hill community. It's, uh, just shocking that all of that would disappear in an instant. [reporter 2] Roberts shot known gang member, Hasan Jones, multiple times. Once in the side, once in the back, and three times in the stomach. [reporter 2] Jones is in the Denver Health intensive care unit. His family, though, says he'll survive. [reporter 3] Well-known anti-gang activist, Terrance Roberts, telling police that he felt threatened and fired in self-defense. [reporter 4] Terrance Roberts blames what happened on gang members in Park Hill, saying they forced him to defend himself. Live in Denver tonight... Live at Fourteenth at... [Julian] The local media was full of stories about the case. None of them seemed to give much credence to Terrance's assertion that he'd feared for his life. Some featured anonymous sources suggesting Terrance wasn't the peace activist he claimed to be. Terrance told me a different story. [Julian] I didn't know if I trusted Terrance. [indistinct chatter] But as I began talking to others in the community, it became clear that there were serious questions about what happened and why that weren't being asked. [George] The day of the peace rally, Terrance called me. He said, "Pops, I need you up here." I said, "Okay, I'll be there, son." He said, "Hurry up, because I don't want to be by myself. I think that they're about to do something to me up here." I knew he was in danger the day he started marching. The day he started speaking up, he was in danger. The beauty of it was he knew he was in danger. I think he was making a lot of noise and I think he was stepping on some people's toes that he shouldn't have. [Jason] Some of these people have a lot of power. I don't know where the directive came from, but in my opinion, what happened came down from a higher... Higher source. If I was in his situation, I'd do the same thing. And I'm not just going to shoot one. If there's four or five, I'm going to make sure everybody catches something. That's just it. You have to. [phone line ringing] - [Shaun] Hello? - Hey, man, we're... We're on our... we're on our way. [Julian] I wanted to find Hasan who'd been paralyzed from the waist down by the shooting, but no one seemed to know where he was. Eventually, some of the gang members who were there that day agreed to speak with me. [man 4] Let's get this shit. Clean it from crime and then give it back to the community. And then, um, echo that motherfucker. Back to the community, back to the community, back to the community, back to the community. What up, what up? Yup. Turn me up a little bit. I ain't never scared when the funk is up. Knowing damn well I might not make it home, but I'm from the Holly. Uh-huh. The Holly. [Aundre] I was there, uh, man. I mean, they argued the whole day. I even went up to Munch, like, "Hey, Munch, quit arguin' with Terrance, nigga. You might not know him, but I do. Come on." Right? Terrance is a good dude. I mean, he really... He really got a big heart. And he loves... he... He loves [indistinct]. And he's very emotional about the way he cares about shit. And when he took on that clean up the community, like, type of feel, he meant that shit. Munch is a Blood, and Terrance even respected Munch because Munch was a Blood, a little homie and he probably seen shit in Munch that he seen in himself. - On everything. - [Julian] And that's... He loved the little nigga because he was at b-ball. [Aundre] He took him to basketball games. I'm keeping it real with you. Like, he said, where we come from, we just don't do that to somebody we love. Like, I love this nigga. I called him my bro... [Aundre] You should never bite... I would never, you know what I mean, - I could never... - Walk away from him. [indistinct]. Yeah, I wheel him around and all that, you know? That's my dude. That's my every day, you know, partner. [Julian] How was he doing? [Aundre] He's not doing too good as far as... [Shaun] He's in a wheelchair for life. [Aundre] He's kind of messed up mentally. - [Shaun] Fucked up. - [Aundre] For sure. [Julian] What is... what is Munch like? What is he like? He's just a product of his environment, like we all are. Trying to find a way out. That was it. 'Cause he lives hard, all that. Sleeping in spots with bed bugs and roaches and the homies are taken care of. I mean, hey, he's a good dude. Straight up. [Julian] Hey. Wait. Yeah. [birds chirping] [indistinct chatter] [George] I don't want to die in my sin. I was in Oakland, California. My son Terrance could tell you, he used to come to Oakland to see me. I was one of the biggest ballers. I gave it all up. I gave Oakland up. I came home. Not because I didn't want to be a dope dealer no more, because I was afraid that I was going OD in Oakland and I didn't want to come back in a box. [sparse applause] What is it about me knowing that you love me so much that you stopped me from doing cocaine? I know I'm doing wrong. I know I'm living foul. But my God still keeps me.

You die, die for a reason. All Terrance had was a vision to stop the violence in the community. He said "If I got to be a martyr, I want to build this Holly back up. They just going to have to kill me, but I'mma die for a purpose, for a cause." I love the Crips and I love the Bloods, but I promise you I am not going to be afraid of nobody.

It's... it... it created my whole character. All the energy you see come out of me sometimes. I got that in the Holly Square. The Holly has always been such a central place for Black life. It was a respite for Black people who wanted to socially interact, politically interact. The shopping center was there. There was a church that was there, a daycare center that was there, and there was a whole lot of activists that was there. The Holly was a hub of the Denver chapter of the Black Panther Party. [Hasira] The Black Panthers were protective forces inside of the community. [Sheria] When we were kids, they would feed us breakfast in the mornings before we went to school. And one morning we came to eat breakfast and the FBI had shut the chapter down. [Hasira] External government forces dismantled the Black Panther Party in order to stop the rise of leaders in the Black community. If Terrance was born 25 years earlier, he would have been a Black Panther. But because the Black Panthers were eliminated, there became a vacuum of leadership in the Black community. And Terrance, uh, grew up in that vacuum. Police! Police! Police! [reporter 5] Now, the same big drug money that's made death a common LA street scene is bringing the California street scene to Denver. [Terrance] If you grew up in the late '80s, early '90s in northeast Denver, gangs were movements. We're talking about thousands of kids. I became a Blood because I really loved my community. I didn't become a Blood because I like wearing red, I became a Blood because that was the representation of the community where I was from. [Jason] Them days when he was a younger cat and he was protecting the hood, riding in his car and he had, like, a MAC-11 on the seat and he was doing nothing but riding up and down the blocks, making sure that there wasn't no Crips, no Crabs nowhere. I mean, because he was protecting everybody. [Terrance] My nickname was C.K. Showbizz. C.K stands for Crip Killer. Showbizz had a demon in him to cause him to want to do wrong to people, especially to Crips. Terrance had a spirit inside of him that... You didn't have to be a gangbanger. Just, if he wanted to get you, he was going to get you. Fast murders, a lot of shootings. Lot of people got damaged during those times, too, man. A lot of PTSD. [police siren wailing] [somber music playing] [crickets chirping] [Terrance] I was in jail looking at a life sentence. I was already tired of getting shot, getting into the fistfights, gangbanging. I was watching this documentary about Martin Luther King. [Martin Luther King] That the greatness of America is the right to protest for rights. I literally grew up one block south of Martin Luther King Boulevard. I never had heard the speech. I never knew much about Martin Luther King. We've got some difficult days ahead. But it really doesn't matter with me now because I've been to the mountaintop. [crowd cheering] I don't mind. He said at the end of his speech, like, "When you get to the mountaintop, I won't be there, but God has shown me the vision and all that, like, movement made me want to cry. But I'm sitting here with all these big ol' Crips and Bloods, you know. So I was, like... but I felt, like, tears in my eyes. I was like, man, this is deep. And I was just in my cell and I was just like... It was like... I kind of stayed up all night just thinking about my life. I was just like, you know what? I'm done. I'm just... I like my name. My name's Terrance. I started reading more about activists and I read the autobiography of Malcolm X, of Martin Luther King, I read Soul on Ice, I read Soul on Fire. That started seeping into my spirit that that's the kind of person who I wanted to be like. [children chatting] [man 4] Hands up! [reporter 6] Terrance Roberts created the Prodigal Son Initiative. My organization is mainly preventative. They don't know if they want to play football and be a Bronco or hang out with these local guys with the cool car in the corner who wear red or blue all day. Um, and those are the kids who I reach. We get them before they get involved. Prodigal Son is tight. Make sure when you come to Prodigal Son you bring your homework, okay? 'Cause that's gonna be- [boy] Turn around, show 'em the shirt. I learned perseverance, honesty, respect, and it really changed me and everybody here. I'm just Terrance Roberts, man, who grew up right up the street. We got love for y'all, man. If you all caught up in the gang, you got somewhere to go. We were converting some of the, um, active Bloods and Crips into a new movement to put the guns down called the Camo Movement. And today is our day to show our youth that you do have positive role... Male role models, you do have... He just felt like camouflage was the color of the people. You know what I mean? And instead of wearing the red and blue, we just wear camo. That's basically all it was. [Terrance speaking indistinctly] [Alex] Nobody expected Terrance to come back the way he did after serving ten years in prison. [Terrance speaking indistinctly] And then to come out and then launch one of the most successful, not only gang prevention, but violence reduction programs. That's what it's all about right there. [laughing] [Terrance] Just thank you guys, man. This is just... And then in 2008... You know, retaliation for the murder of a rival gang member or gang leader at the time. Crip gang members burned down the entire shopping center. [police sirens wail] [reporter] So y'all think the Crips did it? - Yes. Yeah, we know that. - We know they did. [man 5] This is worse than 9/11 to me. This is... this is my home. You know what I'm saying? This Iraq, right here. [George] The retaliation is going to be strong and that is going to cause a city-wide war. [police sirens wail] [Phillips] But then behind the scenes, Terrance Roberts had a different drumbeat. He said, "This has to stop." [Terrance] We're walking to love everybody. We're walking to unity. Everybody, Black, white, Hispanic, Christian, Muslim, Jew, Gentile, anybody. We love this community, we love everybody. And I think it's just time that we just start showing that. Yeah. [Alex] It stood for peace. And it stood for community and it stood for prosperity and it stood for uplifting. And it was very profound. [Terrance] No, I don't like what Bloods and Crips are doing to my community. - But I love you, though. - [man 6] Stop the violence. Look at this little girl right here. With all of us here, ten police cars, she still has tears in her eyes because she told me she's scared. So if you're a Blood or Crip or anybody, or if your family members are Bloods or Crips in this audience, we love them, but enough's enough. [man 6] That's right. ♪ [Terrance] When the Holly got burned down, I thought they were just going to shut the Holly down. They almost pretty much did. I literally was laying on my bed and had a... a dream. And it was a semi dream-vison, I don't know, I was half asleep. And I had my friend draw this vision that I had. In my mind, I had this picture of what if we could do these colorful basketball courts and put a youth center here? I'm here in what I consider to be my office. But it's the entire Holly shopping center. And this is the Holly Square Peace Mural Project. [indistinct chatter] Basketball courts are pretty much completed right now. The building is getting painted. We have the playgrounds right here. [man 6] He really kind of put a heartbeat back in the hood. [upbeat music playing] He transformed the future for the entire community. It's sad that the Holly burnt down, but now we have something better and it should live on forever. [all cheering] [Terrance speaking indistinctly] [Julian] One of the young gang members Terrance took an interest in was Hasan. He was a second generation Blood. Terrance had grown up with his father, Isaac Alexander, who was known as Iceman. He was one of the first Bloods in Denver and still an active gang member. About six months before Terrance shot Hasan, another original Blood Terrance knew opened a computer repair shop at the other end of the block. It became a new stronghold for the gang. The Bloods and the Camo Movement began fighting for the allegiance of the younger guys in the neighborhood. Hasan was in the middle. [Terrance] One day I was driving through the Holly and I saw Hasan. So I called him to my car, said, "Hey, I got these tickets to the Nuggets game tonight. You want to come with me?" He was like, "For reals?" [announcer] Let's go! And when we rode to the Nuggets game, he told me he had never been to a sporting event in his whole life. We're driving back, we leave, and I'm about to drop him back off in the Park Hill by the Holly and he almost started crying, he was a little in tears, saying, "One time..." This is how he started, he said, "Bro, you know, I see my dad in the Holly with 30,000 in cash and brand new Benz and I asked him to give me some money and he told me I need to get my hustle up." He got emotional, almost start crying, saying that I've done more for him than Iceman had ever done for him. Why would I want to hurt this young man who I'm mentoring? I think Hasan was manipulated into being... To want to hurt me, beat me up, and run me out. I definitely see Hasan as... as a pawn. ♪ [Julian] I still haven't been able to find Hasan. But I was able to get access to the interview Denver police did with him three weeks after the shooting. [Officer] It's now 4:06 p.m. and we're at Denver Health Medical Center with Mr. Hasan Jones. And now my understanding is you're paralyzed? [Hasan] Yeah. I can't, uh, feel my legs. [Officer] Hmm. I'm sorry to hear that. [EKG beeping] Prior to the day you were shot, were you getting along with Terrance or... [Hasan] Yeah. I never had no problem with him. I thought he was more, like, one of the people that, like, was trying to help people like me who was in the gangs and was trying to get out. And, like, he done took me to the Nuggets game, but something in the back of my head was telling me, like, something's not right. I just remember swerving on my bike down at the gazebo. And he walked upon me. [indistinct shouting] I looked at him. Boom. Jumped off my bike. I ran away. He shot me in the back. [reporter] How many years have you been... - [gun shooting] - Uh-oh. [Hasan] I just remember him coming up to me and hovering over me with the gun. And then about, like, the third gunshot, I just... passed out. [Hasan] One of my friends came in and said they seen him trying to put a knife in my hand. [water running] [Julian] Terrance had never mentioned anything to me about a knife, which I learned police had recovered at the scene. [George] When this happened, they went messing with Terrance Roberts. You opened up Pandora's box, and Terrance might not agree with me, but when they opened up Pandora's box, Showbizz woke up. And Showbizz came out. And Showbizz is a demon. And now I just pray to the spirit that that demon goes back into his tomb, that demon goes back into his grave, that demon dies and goes back. Amen, to the pits of hell from which it came from. And, Lord, resurrect Terrance Roberts. ♪ All they got is a person with a video and they've got someone that says you shot Hasan. Oh, wait a minute, they don't need the person that says that you shot Hasan because you say you shot Hasan. I was afraid of Hasan and if I plea to anything, it takes away my right to a trial by jury. And I'm not going to take a deal to go to prison over what these men wanted to have happen to me, to take my position and take my life. Even the police, possibly. [Marshal] Best we can tell, people have been afraid to talk to us. Best we can tell, people have been told by Munch to not cooperate. We don't 100% know why he's saying that. What we need is to be able to show the jury why your fear was legitimate. I don't know what to say, but let's see if a jury of 12 thinks that I didn't have a right to defend my life. And that's it.

And within the last 90 minutes, Denver police confirming an increase in gang violence in the metro area. ♪ [car honking] [indistinct shouting] [indistinct]. We needed to know about this. Get that on tape, and that's for real. [indistinct arguing] [Michael] We stand here together to announce a coordinated and multilayered approach to halting the gang violence that is plaguing some of our northeast Denver neighborhoods. Immediately, I directed our police department to provide additional staffing and patrols in the affected neighborhoods. Since I've heard about the police, I was five years old hearing about more patrols. I was eight years old. More patrols. [laughs] I was 13. I wasn't even a gang member yet. They're going to do more patrols because this. Then I was a gang member, it was more patrols. It's up to the killers to stop the killing. No... no gang activist or nobody, even the police can't just accredit themselves for stopping the violence, it's the people who got to get the credit for that. Because they stop when they want to stop. And they stop when they believe in something. [Julian] Terrance was an anti-gang activist in the classic mold of the Truce of Nine Deuce, the 1992 LA gang truce whose motto was, "Nobody can stop this war but us." In many African American communities, independent movements were believed to be more effective than law enforcement funded efforts. We marched together down here. We still holding strong.

And we've seen each other a couple of times in that dark alley. [laughs] We both here, so we all right. Straight up. How often do you feel disrespected in your home? Man, Terrance is a good dude, man. And it's, like, his heart is so big and he just want to do right by the people. By, as we always say, by our people. A lot of us are in gangs or in prison and we don't have no resources, so we don't be even talking to kids. We can't stop nobody from banging, but we can set an example like we do with coaching or Prodigal Sons. But how are you going to set an example if you don't have resources? [Gerald] You can't tell them to stop doing something if you don't have nothing to give 'em. So we can start by supporting each other. Having male support groups. You know what I mean? Talking about what we trying to do in the neighborhood and showing them that it does work. [Gerald] Violence is evil and we had to learn that ourselves by doing it and it being done to us. You know what I'm saying? So nobody wants to keep repeating this cycle. Some do. We don't. [Julian] Denver's gang violence was on a disturbing course when Prodigal Sons started in 2004. Terrance told me he believed that engaging the community in the redevelopment was a key factor in reversing that trend. [Julian] But Terrance wasn't the only one interested in redeveloping Holly Square. After the fire, two powerful institutions went in with the city of Denver to buy the site with additional funding from billionaire Philip Anschutz, they began to build a Boys and Girls Club. Or a bunch of politicians to... Terrance initially supported the effort and became the face of it. But he soon found himself at odds with the developers because he realized he had no real say and that the people being hired in paid positions, from management to construction workers, were all from outside the community. He was just out there being explosive. And so that's Terrance, though. But what he was saying in a lot of ways wasn't wrong. You know, it was actually right. And using some of the concepts that were generated by the mind of Terrance Roberts. [Julian] I spoke to the CEO of the Urban Land Conservancy, Aaron Miripol, who is the lead developer of the site. Yeah, I... I would have to say, Julian, I think a lot of folks have moved on. I'm not saying that people don't talk about it. I'm not... But I would say for... For a lot of people, you know, when we're having a [indistinct] meeting that is not front and center, that is not the... It's like, what are we... What's the next piece of work that's happening? [Aaron] We're now at a point where we're talking about what happens here, this is interim space, but this will get redeveloped at some point. And we just put out proposals, um, last week for, um, the next phase of redevelopment here at the Holly. So stay tuned. Terrance was trying to save a neighborhood he came from, and the city wanted to gentrify it. And Terrance just didn't play ball. But if the city was able to control him, would've been great for their agenda. ♪ [Julian] About a year before the shooting, Terrance's funding sources began drying up.

We have to close our after school program because we just don't have enough funds to run an adequate program. [Julian] As Prodigal Son was on the brink, the city offered Terrance a way out by joining its federally funded anti-gang effort, Project Safe Neighborhoods. Our Project Safe Neighborhoods initiative. [Julian] America's biggest anti-gun and anti-gang effort, run by federal law enforcement and local police. In Denver, the initiative received additional support from several of the same organizations that were leading the Holly redevelopment. I was trying to create a pro-social relationship with them. But yet saying, but don't ask me for information. And that's what they want out of their activists in the city. They want word on the street information. That's not my job, man. Why are you asking me about crack houses and stuff? I don't hang out at crack houses. And when I didn't want to play that game, they wanted me out. [birds chirping] [indistinct chatter] [Reverend] Mwah. Yeah. [Julian] The man the city chose to take over the federal anti-gang effort from Terrance was 60 year old Reverend Leon Kelly, who began his career in the mid 1980s when the Crips and Bloods first arrived in Denver. We have a close working relationship with the, uh, police, those who a... Are out there on the streets. The Reverend Leon Kelly! There he is! He's all about that mad, crazy love. - What's up? - [Reverend] Yeah. You know you got me in a lot of trouble? So in the wake of this increase of violence, you know, uh, in the wake of what happened with, uh, Hasan and all of that, we've been concerned about the activities that have been going back and forth over on the east side. The Gang Violence Interruption Program, that's us. A group of OG's who've been established in their neighborhood that will come together and will make decisions, you know, as to what needs to happen and what could happen. [Julian] How do you get them to do that? I mean, do they... do they get paid or why are they- There is one Reverend Kelly here. There's things that I've done personally with a lot of these guys that nobody else knows. I feel like the Godfather. I grant you this favor, but I may never need you in life again. But if it ever come a time that I need you, for whatever reason, you know, I will call you, you know, and I'll expect for you to come. And, uh, we're gonna be housed in Park Hill. [Julian] We're going to be... Oh, you're going to have - an office over there? - Yeah. [Julian] By the Holly? You're gonna be at the Holly? We're going to be at Terrance's old place. ♪ [Julian] I knew all four of the men Reverend Kelly said he had hired to replace Terrance as anti-gang workers in the new federal effort. They self-identified as active gang members. One of them was Carl McKay, who also went by "Fat Daddy." He was the guy who had opened the computer repair shop in the Holly about six months before the shooting. I don't even think Carl McKay knows how to open someone's computer, let alone repair. [Julian] You ever been to Carl's computer repair shop? Hell, no. They ain't gonna get my computer so they can be a... Put no virus in my shit. [Julian] I noticed that Carl's critical views of Terrance appeared in a lot of the news coverage of the shooting. But I couldn't find evidence Carl was working for the police. In fact, suspicion about one person or another working for law enforcement was one of the most common rumors I heard. [Alex] Informants are utilized in our neighborhoods to turn information over to law enforcement. Police can effectively yank in a 21-year-old for murder and say, "Do you want to go to... you want to go... Up to Canyon City for the rest of your life or do you want to work for us and help us out here?" [Alex] In our community, trust is the difference between life and death, for real. [Skipp] Who's the confidential informant? Who's working for the police and who aren't? We all wear the same clothes. We all speak the same language. Wear the same hats. It's hard to tell who is who. Black people are taught not to talk about it in our own communities because of the fear. And the fear that informants come with is the fear of the establishment. Just go back into history. Informants were used by COINTELPRO and J. Edgar Hoover and the head of the FBI to undermine leaders in the Black community. - [indistinct] - Let's go. [Julian] The targeting of activists is once again a concern in African American communities across America. [woman 3] The government has systematically eliminated Black people who have tried to awaken the masses of other Black people. [Julian] Does Terrance fit the profile of someone who is targeted or taken down? He doesn't fit the profile, he personifies the profile. Absolutely, I think he's been targeted. I mean, I've seen people in the activist community get targeted for less. [birds chirping] [Julian] I couldn't figure out whether Carl's shop was a front or not, but it shut down soon after the shooting. I did discover that in the six months before the shooting, when the shop was briefly open, an undercover law enforcement effort, Operation Bleed Out, was running at the Holly. Denver police and federal law enforcement employed Blood gang members as informants. They were wired up with pinhole cameras and given 13 targets in the community. One of the cops involved was Mike Calo, head of the District Two police, whose station was three blocks from Holly Square. Commander Calo had known both Reverend Kelly and Terrance for decades, but he and Terrance had a falling out when Terrance became outspoken about Denver police misconduct. [indistinct speech] [Julian] Commander Calo had initially said he was happy to talk to me. But as it became clear I had developed sources deep in the neighborhood, his attitude changed. [indistinct chatter] [Julian] A camera. [Calo] I know, but what are you filming for? [Julian] I heard this was a public meeting. [Calo] Who invited you? [Julian] Oh, I actually saw it on Facebook. [Calo] Yeah, they usually don't allow that. [pensive music playing] Me and some of my friends, we got down with Reverend Leon Kelly, Carl McKay, Mohammed Radebe, Michelle, Big Riot. We're going to be over here occupying this, uh, building. [Calo] You got to watch, um, [bleep], man, he's still hard. You see this? [Calo] Is it going to be any stress if they do? Mm, I doubt it, man. ♪ [Julian] I'd been avoiding Terrance's calls. I sensed he would not take well to the idea that Carl and the other Bloods had taken over his old office. But eventually, I answered the phone. [tense music plays] [reporter] Tonight at ten, new developments in what is becoming a concerning trend in Denver, an increase in gang violence. Just last night, three people were killed in two shootings. Tonight, city and police officials try and find a way to stop this violence. There is too much violence in our community tonight. What Denver's experienced just this weekend should not be tolerated by any community. Bullets are still flying in the Holly Shop-Shopping center. Why? Why? We're sitting here in the lion's den. They're talking about gangs. When you show up, you wonder why they're not welcoming you in is because when you show up, somebody's going to jail. - Someone is being killed. - [applause] [woman] I'm not saying all cops are bad, but there are pigs, okay? Admit it. There are pigs. Okay? Don't sit up here and say, "Oh, 1%" because I came to a meeting one time. They said 1% was bad. Bullshit! Carl. Your... your thoughts? I'm, uh, from... Originally from Park Hill. [Julian] Carl's the one who opened the computer repair shop down the street from Terrance. [Carl] You know, if you want the solution, you go to the problem. And so what we need and what we're asking for is for everybody to just step out the way and let us solve the problem. [Calo] What we need at this point is for you to come forward, Carl, and bring the young fellows in and say enough is enough. Thirty years ago. [Julian] Then, Reverend Kelly spoke about the conflict that led to the shooting involving Terrance and Hasan. Dynamic... dynamics. We had a situation up in Park Hill, somebody trying to do something for the community. People didn't like that. They come up on him because he tried to do what he tried to do. They didn't like it. - [Terrance] Well say that then. - That's what I've said. [man] Hold on just a second, everybody. - Are you serious? - [man] First, I do want to say. I hate to be disruptive, but we're talking about four murders yesterday. Let's keep going with what y'all doing and it'll be another killing, because it's bullshit. Where's the money? How much money you worth? - Mm-hmm. - [man] Yeah. - Y'all investigate that. - [man] Yeah. [reporter] Former gang leaders meet with Denver's police chief in the community after a weekend of gang violence. Standing room only, full of tension. Former members of the Bloods and Crips saying they're sick of all the violence. That was just about the only thing, though, everyone in the room could agree upon. But no solutions came out of the meeting except call police if you know anyone involved. [chuckles] That's what everybody's saying, no solutions. 'Cause they don't got the answers. [woman on TV talking indistinctly] They don't know what to do. [Julian] After the meeting, I kept thinking about what Reverend Kelly said... about the older gang members putting, quote, "jumper cables" on the younger guys to go after Terrance on the day of the peace rally. I called Reverend Kelly. [Julian] Hey, Rev. - [Kelly] Julian? - [Julian] Yeah. Yeah. [Julian] But do you think that it's possible that these older guys, like Carl, were involved in telling these guys to go after him? [Julian] Well, I mean... [crickets chirping] [Julian] Why would Reverend Kelly know about the surveillance of Terrance? I also had to wonder if the police had something on him. Terrance had been staying off Facebook. But after the meeting, he got back on. [tense music plays] - [man] What's up? - How are you doing, my man? [indistinct conversation] [hissing] [elevator voice] Going down. So pretty much if I lose, I'm getting life. So, um... he was saying that the habitual criminal statute was for actual criminals who were selling dope, stealing money, harming, that's what it was made for. But for whatever reason, they felt like I need to be charged with it. [elevator voice] Going up. And the DA got Terrance's life in his hand right now. Reverend Kelly has the key to this city. And, man, when it comes to politicians and people that are in authority over Terrance's life, he can tell them... Reverend Kelly can tell the DA right now what... what not to do. Did you know that they're about to try to file the habitual criminal on Terrance? [indistinct conversation] [George] Um, I know you wanted to get your voice out there, but, man, the DA and everybody's looking at that and that's what made them charge you because of the Facebook things that you're saying. What did his voice say? I'm charged with habitual criminal, pops. He hasn't done shit. [George] Yes, but he talked to the DA before they post that on you. And you know what he did? He said he backed up from it because you gonna stay off of Facebook. Nigga, I can get on Facebook if I want, my nigga. Okay, but you looking at life in prison, I'd shut this motherfucker down. - [Terrance] Nigga... - And I'm a priest telling you! I should be able to do it, I'm an activist, pops. I should say what I want, my nigga. I can get on Facebook if I want. After the trial. Before the trial, how about that? I'm the one looking at the time, not you, my nigga. Everyone wants to be silent, my nigga. My lawyers are getting me prosecuted, not my criminal actions, my nigga. [George] Then... Just accept the charges. And I'm accepting 'em, okay? [George] So don't take it to trial, just go. I'm not about to go to jail because I'm on Facebook. I'm going to trial, what are you talking about? I'm just saying, man, you called out the DA, man, - that's... that's crazy. - Man... - [George] That's suicidal. - The DA has not charged - these police off this... - That ain't your business. It is my business, these are my people. I care about that shit. I care about Michael Brown getting shot 13 times. I care about Eric Garner getting choked to death and he's saying, "I can't breathe." I care about that shit, pops. It matters to me, my nigga. Black Lives Matter, my nigga. I'm not afraid of these niggas, pops. I'm not afraid of the DA's office. - Fuck the DA. - [George] Don't say that. Why not, nigga? Fuck 'em. - What're you talking about? - See where they got your head... I'm... and I'm charged with habitual criminal. Why shouldn't I say it? Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em. Call in Tom [indistinct] and Mayor Hancock... [dialogue fades away into tense music] If I was white, I'd be Captain America. But since I'm Terrance from Northeast Denver, I'm an angry activist, nigga. [siren blares] Hey. Me and Miss Shirley were sitting right here and we all three looked down at the end of the alley. We see two cars coming down real slow. Two car loads of Bloods. They look at us, all three of us dead in our faces. They didn't have no masks on, no scarves on. They was... Didn't have no gloves on. And, um, I heard somebody say, "Pastor." And next thing you know, they rode by us and soon as they got on the other side of the dumpsters, they was firing. And it wasn't no three or four shots either. I mean, you can just hear, like... like, World War Three. [imitating gunfire] We took off running. Can you see the tree right here leakin'? They hit about right in here. They hit it right there. They hit it right here. And you can see the sap coming down out of it... as if it's bleeding or something. [siren wailing] And God's taking care of me. God put a hedge around me. That's why the bullets are in that tree and in that pole instead of in me. And I heard them. [imitating bullets passing] I heard 'em pass by. I hit my knees right there on that grass. - Lost my diamond ring. - [woman chuckles] Off my pinky finger. Amen. And her and her babies found my ring the next day. And I had to go preach a funeral the next day. I had to go preach a funeral the next day. Yes, sir. Because I know who it was. Yeah, I know who it was. I looked that man dead in his face. And, um, you know, he looked me in the face. Yeah. [Julian] Later, George told me that it was Hasan he'd seen eye to eye that night. I couldn't prove it. But soon afterward, I finally found Hasan in the county jail. He was locked up for a different drive by shooting that happened near the Holly. Hasan had been arrested in his girlfriend's apartment where her two-year-old daughter, Ny'Ari "Ny-Ny" Hines, was found dead. [woman] Coroner's office, how may I help you? [Julian] I'm just trying to find... According to the coroner's report, Ny-Ny's feet had wheelchair marks on them, and there were cigarette burns on her body. The cause of death was listed as homicide. The family invited me to the funeral service. According to them, Hasan was the only one home with Ny-Ny that night. Father God, we come and bow down here on Tuesday night. First of all, giving you thanks, for all thanks, thanks for baby Ny-Ny. Thank you for the life that she lived. Now, Father God, we ask that you touch right now, this mother, touch her in a supernatural way. [George] She's just sleeping right now. She'll wake up in Heaven. This dude, his life gets spared though, Gerald. He gets shot five times, his life gets spared, and then he kills a little kid? [sighs] [Julian] Meanwhile, one of the few people who had witnessed up close Terrance shoot Hasan finally agreed to speak to me. [Kamau] Hey, what's up? [Julian] A DJ, he was setting up to play the peace rally when the shooting happened. This is my career, this is how I make a living, this is how I feed my family. We met 2006, maybe, or something. And that was kind of around the time that we were starting to do the... The camo thing, too. So, you know, he just... I just loved what he was doing for the community. They were waiting for him to slip up, but he just kept doing what he believed in. I don't know, there was, you know, some name calling. You know, telling how he was a snitch and this and that. Yeah, they started coming over there. Four here, five there. Three here, two there. [indiscernible shouting] [Julian] What... what if they ask you to testify? Will that put you in a hard position? I don't know if I really wanna... You know, we ain't really... Don't put that in. Yeah, I don't wanna talk about that right now. I don't even wanna bring that up. [Julian] Well, you can't help the fact that you happen to be standing there, right? Yeah, that word... I don't really wanna... I wanna kinda stay away from that word. You know what I mean? I wanna stay away... I wanna stay away from all that. [phone ringing] [Julian] Hello? [Julian] Carl, who was working under the federal grant to fight gang violence, was pulled over after driving erratically through the Holly. The car had fake plates, open liquor was on the console. Police searched the vehicle and found what appeared to be heroin, cocaine, and meth pipes. Apparently trying to get out of an arrest, Carl also, quote, "stated several times that he worked for Commander Calo." Carl gets caught with three schedule one drugs. Working for Rev. That shit's crazy. [tense music plays] [phone ringing] - [Kelly] Yeah. - [Julian] Hey, Rev. What's going on? [Julian] What does it mean with Carl's arrest? [Julian] Hasan's father had a long rap sheet, including recent assault and gun charges that were dropped. A few weeks earlier, he'd shown up to one of Reverend Kelly's anti-gang events. He wore a red Kansas City Chiefs hat. In the gang world the hat's C and K letters had a very specific meaning. Crip Killer. [Kelly] Yeah, uh, yeah, he's up under my wing now. But he's under... I mean, is Isaac... Is he working actually on this program or... What do you mean he's under your wing, I don't... [Julian] Active gang members, drug dealers, violent felons. These were the men who replaced Terrance Roberts in Denver's federal anti-gang effort. Billions of dollars had poured in to fight the problem, but the violence was sharply rising. [Julian] "Little Crip" was Derek Wilford. Terrance and Gerald told me he had inside information about misconduct in the city's anti-gang effort. Two days earlier, he'd finally agreed to speak to me. Now he was dead. [indistinct chatter] [man] Right there. So now check this out. We're at over 1,000 deaths later. And that's why we thought that this was important. This particular... Gerald. My question is, can we stop the gangs out here? I don't think so. I think we can slow down. But you can't have active gang members working programs out here with these kids. [Jeff] Hey... hey, Gerald. I want you to again focus on this particular sheet. Y'all already discussed that, brother, - that's why I said, man. - [Jeff] Yeah? My heart hurts, because you can't have active gang members working with these little dudes that are gang mem... Gang banging. You know what I'm saying? - It's... it's not gonna work. - [Jeff] Yeah. It's not gonna work. 'Cause some of these dudes, they're still gang banging, still selling dope and all that too. [Julian] A few weeks later, Hasan Jones went to trial for the drive by shooting. - [crowd murmuring] - [engine roars] The courtyard was full of protesters demanding an investigation of the Denver police for a series of excessive force cases. [man] Sergeant Dominick Salinas. [Julian] But it was one particular moment in Hasan's trial that caught my attention. [man] Had you heard Hasan Jones's voice before? [Dominick] Yes. [man] Would you be able to recognize it - over the phone? - [Dominick] I would. [man] Did you have a conversation with Hasan Jones on May 31st, 2014? [Dominick] I did. [judge] Sure. [Julian] Why would Hasan Jones, a gang member, be in regular phone contact with a police officer? I ran a records request on Hasan and was able to find that in the three years before being shot by Terrance, he'd been arrested nearly two dozen times, including for child abuse, two drug possessions, and four assaults. Yet he was never charged for any of those offenses. [phone ringing] It's Marshal. [Julian] Can you put it on speaker? - Hello? - [Marshal] Hello, Terrance? - Hey, Marshal. - [Marshal] Hey, what's up? What's the information you got? So this guy named [bleep]. And around Hasan and them when they were not only saying that they thought I was a snitch, but from what he says, he even knows that they wanted to hurt me and have me killed and they sent Hasan to me. He said he was all in on these conversations. He said he's been really breaking them down and he said he wants to come forward about it. He even told these Bloods this and they're upset with him right now. [Marshal] Okay, so how do we get in touch with them? [Julian] Terrance gave me his number as well, and the man agreed to meet me. When the day came, I waited for an hour and was about to leave when he came in. [Marshal] And so let's just get it out there. Why did you shoot Hasan? Because I was afraid for my life. I felt like, not only was I going to be assaulted, but I was going to get killed. Pretty much verbatim he said, "On Bloods, I'll be over there in a minute to fuck you up." And I clarified with him, I said, "On Bloods, Hasan? This is what you're gonna do?" He said, "On Bloods, we're going to be over there in a minute." [Marshal] Is another option that they would - physically attack you? - Murder me. [Marshal] And then what happened? [Terrance] During the course of I was having this conversation, a truck had pulled up and he beelined to the truck and with a snicker told me pretty much, like, "Yeah, it's on." So I immediately beelined to my truck to go get my pistol. [Marshal] Did you believe that there was something coordinated about the movement of that truck and Hasan? Absolutely. Marshal and Tyrone tried to explain it to me, but I didn't follow it very well, and then you mentioned it again today is the knife. - [Terrance] Yeah. - Where does it come from? When me and KTONE pulled up, it was there by the camera. I had thrown down. Like, kind of on this half-eaten chicken when we pulled up, it was there and I put it in my pocket. And that was another reason why I shot Hasan, because they were leaving notes and then they left a chicken with a knife there. Now we know we're going to have witnesses that say you should have... you should have called the police, you should have done this, that, and the other. And our comeback to that is, under the law, you don't have to. We're not here saying that was the smartest move. We're here saying Mr. Roberts was doing what he was legally entitled to do. All right, all right. [engine roars] [crickets chirping] [Terrance] You would have to start at eight and you only do it for 15 minutes so what you saying to seven? That we start at 7:30 I think that gives me and you plenty of time. And I think that if I focus on my case, there's so much here for me to focus on... - [man] Just the key elements. - Just the key elements of my case of why I think the Denver police are involved and how I feel about the DA's office and these informants. So we're talking about the police station. Are you gonna talk about what's going on between the Bloods and the Crips and the informants, all that? - [Terrance] Yeah. All that. - I think that's important. [Terrance] All that. [Terrance] We're dealing with a youth war in this city, a war that never would have had to happen, had active gang members not worked for the Denver Police Department and plotted to remove me from my position over political reasons. Active gang members should not be able to work for law enforcement agencies. Get ready to see my attorneys. [tense music plays] ♪ [siren blares] The Holly. The Holly is part of the Park Hill neighborhood. It's been in the news for many reasons over the last decade. And more recently it's been part of urban redevelopment. All of the evidence that you hear will tell you that Terrance Roberts pulled a gun, shot Hasan Jones as Hasan was running away. Then walks up to Hasan Jones lying on the ground, bleeding, shoots him again. And then throws a knife down on top. Thank you. But we expect the evidence to show you that Mr. Roberts is very happy to be here in front of you. Pleased to be here, in front of a jury. Because the reality for Mr. Roberts is he expected to die that day. [reporter] Thank you so much for continuing. After how many years have you... - [gunshots] - Uh-oh. [man] Ladies and gentlemen, I do have to ask you to remain in the jury room for a short period. [indistinct] [reporter] Prosecutors in this case say that Terrance Roberts shot the victim in the neck and in the heart area, and they say you don't do that unless you intend for someone to die. [George] If the case come back guilty, you know, this may be God's way of breaking Terrance down and humbling him. As a parent, it's hard, but as a pastor, there's some things you have to go through so God can get the glory and bring you out. [reporter] Roberts has a criminal past and could face up to 100 years or more behind bars. We'll have more on this story on 7News at five. [indistinct] What was the involvement of Terrance Roberts with the location that had been the hub? Is there naturally tension between an anti-gang activist and a gang? And to your knowledge, was Mr. Roberts labeled a snitch by some of the Park Hill... And... does that give license for members of the Park Hill Bloods to do anything against Mr. Roberts? [Marshal] Why? [woman] Thank you, Your Honor, we would ask to call Terrance Roberts. [attorney] Let's talk about the rally. What was the purpose of the rally? [Terrance] Um, tensions in the city had started rising. After the arson at the Holly, we thought that we had tensions between the Bloods and Crips kind of down, gang murders were way down, but then they started some, like, shootings. Fights were happening over... all over town. So, we just wanted to have a community rally just to get people together. [attorney] So at some point, are you setting up for the rally? We started unloading DJ KTONE's car. And the second trip that I made unloading his car, I seen a half-eaten rotisserie chicken with a note on top of it that said, "Bitch nigga, snitch nigga" with a knife on top of it. [attorney] And then what happened? [Terrance] Um, I put the knife in my pocket. Hasan rode past us on a bicycle, and a bunch of us were right there behind him. I started to see Bloods coming really from everywhere. Mainly from the East and the South. [attorney] Why, instead of getting your gun, why didn't you just get in your car? I mean... I mean, these guys were all over. I didn't feel like I could get in my car safely 'cause that's not the best place you wanna be if you're getting assaulted or shot at. [attorney] Did you anticipate that any of these Blood gang members are armed at this point? [Terrance] They were acting like they were armed. And they were... I tried to run, they tried to grab my leg. I thought I could be killed at any second. [attorney] How many times did you shoot? [Terrance] About, initially, three times. - [attorney] Okay. - [Terrance] Maybe four, but I thought it was three times. [attorney] Okay. And then what happened? [Terrance] I seen Hasan fall. And I walked over to Hasan. He was looking up and he was saying, "Blood, you're stupid" to me. He was talking to me, he was coherent. And I shot him. He laid back. I put my gun in my left hand, I threw the knife on him. And he said, "Please, Blood, don't kill me." And I stood over him, I said, "I'm not gonna kill you." Then I walked away from him. [attorney] Why did you throw the knife on him? I don't know. - [attorney] Okay. - I don't know why, I just... - Good morning, Mr. Roberts. - [Terrance] Good morning, sir. Let's talk just a little bit about... some of the choices you made that day, right? That's why we're here, right? [Terrance] Yes, sir. [Henry] Let's talk about some other things that you could have done. You could have done nothing, right? [indistinct shouting] [Terrance] Some of these guys are about your height and weigh about 270 pounds and all 15 of them could have kicked me in my head. [Henry] And you said that it's shooting the gun that scared everybody away. How about shooting in the air? Scare everybody? There's a young girl who was in my program who was just killed on [indistinct] because she walked into a room and she shot a gun in the air and in the end shot her and killed her. [Henry] So shooting a gun in the air to scare Hasan Jones and the others was not as good an option as trying to kill Hasan Jones, right? I have to say, I wasn't trying to kill Hasan. You keep saying that, but I wasn't trying to... I just wanted to make sure he couldn't hurt me. [Henry] And there's absolutely no question that you shot Hasan Jones, he went down, you stood over him, and you shot him again. I wasn't standing over him when I shot him. I was walking up to him and he was talking to me. [Henry] Is that a yes or a no that you shot him - on the ground? - Yes, sir. [reporter 1] Terrance Roberts does not deny pulling the trigger in the September 2013 incident. [reporter 2] He admitted to planting a knife near Jones after the shooting that he found earlier in the day. [suspenseful music plays] - [Melissa] How are you doing? - [Terrance] What's up, Melissa? [Melissa] How're you feeling this morning? [Terrance] I wanna tell you something. I think it's very biased how you guys put in there that I said I planted a knife on Hasan because I didn't say that I planted a knife on him. I said they left it at the scene and I threw it onto him after I shot him. And I feel like it's very prejudicial how you guys have been reporting on me. [Melissa] The prosecutors are saying you planted it. Well, they said I planted it after y'all did your report the day before yesterday. Then he started using that language... - [Melissa] But... but no... - [Terrance] You guys made my day very difficult yesterday for me. It was a very difficult day. [indistinct] Father God, we come, we bow down here, giving you thanks for all things. We ask this and we believe this and we receive this. We receive a not guilty plea. We believe in it.
