MAN 1: Guess what, Milwaukee boys and girls? Winter storm Meghan is here, and she is making a mess of the roads out there. WOMAN 1: Businesses across Indianapolis are having no choice but to close shop and send workers home, due to heavy snowfall and ice. WOMAN 2: You thought Cincinnati had it bad, you should see Columbus right now. And yowzers, look at this storm. MAN 2: Looks like Meghan is headed towards Cleveland next. WOMAN 3: It is official, winter storm Meghan is the biggest snowstorm that the mid‐west has seen in over a decade with below freezing temperatures and icy conditions in cities including Columbus, Detroit, Ann Arbor, as well as Green Bay and Philadelphia. There's no question, it will be a white Christmas for this entire region. Temperatures continue to drop right across the mid‐west as winter storm Meghan begins to make her presence known with an arctic blast that is sure to make this a very frosty Christmas. (cell phone buzzing) Hi, Mom, hi, Dad. Hi, honey, is this a bad time? Actually, it is. If I don't get outta here soon I'm gonna miss my flight, so... MOTHER: Well, that's what we're calling about. Is there any way we can convince you to stay here for Christmas? I wish, but it's our busiest time of year, you know? I just‐‐ I can't take off work. Well, you haven't spent Christmas with us in over three years, ever since‐‐ Ivan and I broke up! Yep, I remember. I was there. Did I tell you that I am the chairwoman this year for the Snow Ball? Only about 1,000 times. Oh, it's a shame you won't be there. I know. We just wish we could all be together at Christmas for a change, you know? I'm sorry, Dad, I know. You know what, maybe next year, right? And send me some pictures from the ball. I'll call you on Christmas morning, I promise. ‐Okay, hon. ‐All right. Well, be safe up there, Nina. Always, Dad. Love you guys. Love you, too. WOMAN: The question now is, exactly how bad will winter storm Meghan be for the Cleveland metropolitan area? Will our city bear the full brunt of Meghan, or will we be able to quickly get back to business as usual? Only time will tell. ♪♪ ‐Hi, how are you? ‐Good, thank you. ‐Right this way, ma'am. ‐Thank you. GUARD: Go ahead. This way, please. This way, ma'am. Sir, excuse me! Sir? Excuse me, sir, sir. You have my suitcase. I don't think so. I do think so. It's my suitcase, I would recognize it anywhere. Oh, why is that? Because it's a Hobson Matador. It's the best carry‐on you can buy. We've been all over the world together, and she is very dear to my heart. I feel the same way about mine. (chuckles) How about a bet? If it's yours, I'll give it back. If it's not... you'll give me your number. Seriously, I'm late for my flight and you want to play games? Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm just, you know, tryin' to have some fun. Your suitcase is waiting for you. ♪♪ I'm sorry. (chuckles) Easy mistake. ‐Safe travels. ‐You, too. Hi. Oh, four minutes late, Rooney, that's not like you. I know, I know. Look, I would've been on time, but some guy tried to ask me out at security. Oh, that happens to me all the time. Some guys just have a thing for a woman in uniform. Or for a man. More guys ask for my number on the airport shuttle than anyplace else. I kinda love it. Well, all I know is we are one flight away from a week on the beach in Turks. Why can't I come with you again? Jay, it's a girls' trip. We're gonna be lounging by the pool, and reading trashy magazines and going to the spa. Right, so why can't I come with you? ‐She has a vision. ‐(chuckles) Stop. You know I love you. All right, fine, girls' trip. Who are you flying with? Someone named Brady Sloane? ‐He must be new. ‐Hm. ‐What, you know him? ‐Mm, I haven't met him yet. But he used to work for Sun Bolt. Only been with Jet Jet for a few months, and already he has quite the reputation. He's a quintessential fly boy. You know, charming, too handsome for his own good. Probably has a girlfriend in every city. And a few in the air. Well, good thing we will not be falling prey to his charm. Because we follow numero uno of the airline 10 Commandments. NINA/TARA: "Thou shall not date pilots." Guys. (chuckles) Nice suitcase. Is that a Matador? Got me. Brady. Nina Rooney. It's nice to see you again, Nina Rooney. You guys know each other? ‐No. ‐Yes. We just met, at security. Our bags got mixed up. It was a case of mistaken identity. (chuckles) "Case," good one. ‐Could I see the manifest? ‐Oh, yes. Thanks. Is that the guy who... Yes. And you said no? Commandments, right? Uh, yeah, sure, whatever. Wow, that looks really nasty out there. We need to get this bird loaded up and off the ground before winter storm Meghan steals our vacation. Amen to that. Everything else looks good. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. This is a service announcement for Jet Jet flight 454 with service to Miami. We're going to begin boarding in just a few minutes, so‐‐ Oh, no. I'm sorry, everyone, but it looks like all flights out of Cleveland have been canceled due to dangerously low temperatures. Unfortunately, it's too cold to load the bags or prep the planes. We have vouchers for those who need hotel rooms. Again, Jet Jet flight 454 is canceled. We apologize for the inconvenience. Hi, step right up, thank you. May I see your ticket? I am so sorry about this. Okay, there you go, thanks. ‐Can you check this? ‐Sure. Unless you guys need me, I'm gonna wheel Mrs. Cheddy out here. We're good, thanks. Hasta mañana. NINA: Okay. ♪♪ BRADY: Hey, Rooney! You want a ride? Where are you going? Does it matter? Come on! Thanks. Could've been there for hours. Co‐workers gotta stick together, right? I'll get dropped at the Skylodge, and then the cab's all yours. ‐Sound good? ‐Hm? Uh, yeah. How'd you get a room? Oh, I didn't. Well, you might want to check the app, I heard a couple passengers saying that Skylodge is booked up. Yeah, I, uh‐‐ I don't use apps. Uh, how old is that thing? I don't know. I've had it for a really long time. Can see that. You can laugh, this thing is indestructible. Well, you might want to call the hotel, Fred Flintstone. I'll be fine. I know a guy. The manager. He always hooks me up. All right. (camera shutter clicks) Problem? No. Just wonderin' if you're the kind of person who has to post every moment of their life on social media. Not every moment, no. But I feel like I'm being judged. Not judging. I just prefer to be present. In the present. Well, I'm present, in the present. Whatever that means. Well, we've been in this cab for what, 10 minutes, and you've barely said a word or heard anything I've said, let alone made any eye contact. I barely know you, buddy. And I'm trying to learn more about winter storm Meghan, which is, frankly, threatening to ruin my vacation. (chuckles) Where you headed after Miami? Turks and Caicos, for a week of relaxation, cocktails by the pool, just doing nothing. Hm. What does "hm" mean? Nothin'. I'm just not a do‐nothing kind of guy. I prefer a little more adventure, personally. Kuala Lumpur, Tibet, Mongolia. You know, that kinda thing. Honestly, so do I, but last year, I dragged Tara to the Galapagos over Christmas, so this year it's her turn to pick and she chose Turks. Which is fine by me, I mean, anything's better than spending Christmas here. Really? I would love the chance to have a real white Christmas. You got snow on the ground, icicles on the windows, snowmen. You do not get that in LA. Yeah, I guess you could say I'm dreaming‐‐ Of a white Christmas? Yeah. Here we go. Thanks. You hungry? It's a well‐kept secret this has one of the best seafood places around. You know, uh, thanks for the offer, but I'm‐‐ I'm good. I mean, it's not a date, it's just two co‐workers gettin' to know each other. On me. You asked for my number two hours ago and that didn't work, so now you're just trying a different angle. Now I feel like I'm the one being judged. Look, I don't know you, but I know pilots like you, okay? What does that mean? It means, thank you so much for the cab, and nice to meet you, and I'll see you at work tomorrow. And if I don't, some other time. Okay. Sounds good. ‐Uh, stay warm. ‐You too. ‐Goodnight. ‐Goodnight. (sighs) ‐Wait a sec. ‐DRIVER: Yes, ma'am? ‐We gotta go back. ‐DRIVER: No problem, ma'am. ♪♪ Come on, I know you got a room in that computer somewhere. I wish I did, really, but we're fully booked, Brady. This storm's got way too many travelers stranded. There's nothing I can do. I'm sorry. BRADY: That's all right. Thanks. ‐How's the wife? ‐Wife's good. Hey. Forgot your phone. Oh. ‐Thank you. ‐No problem. So, uh, is that your guy? Yeah. Turns out the hotel is booked. Oh! Hm. But now that I got my phone back, I can figure somethin' out. Are you sure? Yeah, I'll be fine. Okay. Well, good luck. (sighs) BRADY: Can't get any bars. It's gotta be the storm. Yeah. ‐Sloane‐‐ ‐Look, call me Brady. Okay, Brady, you can crash on my couch tonight if you want. Really? 'Cause a minute ago‐‐ No big deal. We'll share a cab to the airport in the morning. I don't want to impose. No imposition, just come on before I come to my senses. Oh, sir, no, I'm not staying here! ‐I'm going downtown, remember? ‐Not with me, you're not. They're closing the highways, it's too icy. When it's unsafe, I go home. Now, you and your boyfriend, you owe me 18 bucks. No, we're not together. That's none of my business, okay? $18, please, young lady. Okay, uh, where's home? You can't stay with me! I know, I just want to know where you live. Oakdale, it's about an hour west of here.

Bring your boyfriend, come on, let's go. ‐What's at Vernon Falls? ‐Oh, my parents' place. They've got plenty of room and they wanted to see me anyway, ‐so it's a win‐win. ‐Yeah, I appreciate this. Don't get too excited. My mom will give you a third‐degree grilling on your whole life story, and my dad will definitely tell you about his fear of flying and how he thinks I should have a job on the ground like everybody else. It's okay. I'm good with parents. Then tonight will be a breeze. ♪♪ My parents love the holidays, if you can't tell. Festive. I like their style. Oh, no. Wait! What's wrong? We can't go in there. It's my parents' annual tree trimming party. That must be why they wanted me to come by. Am I missing something here? I'm just not seeing the problem. You don't understand, it's all our family friends. People who've known me my whole life. You know, all they ever want to know is "Why aren't you married yet?" And "How's your love life?" Blah, blah, blah. It's why I have avoided coming home for Christmas the past three years. Look, these questions come with singlehood, I get it. Okay, well, then you should also get why I don't want to go inside. Yeah, there's something you're not telling me here. I mean, why three years? Why not five or 10? Okay, fine. My ex, Ivan and I, we broke up three years ago right before Christmas, but our families are still friends, and he's in there, so I am definitely not going inside. Okay, but what exactly are we gonna do? Because it's freezing and we're not gonna get another cab again ‐until New Years, so‐‐ ‐I know, I know, I know. We just need to find a workable solution. Sip a little eggnog, sit by the fire, avoid your ex for a few hours. Or, we go in, casually, no big deal, and if anyone asks, you say you're my boyfriend. What? You're not serious. I'm serious and I'm desperate. You want me to lie? Fudge, a little. No way. No. Do this for me tonight, okay? And‐And‐And I'll owe you a favor. What do you say, come on, please? MOTHER: Nina, is that you? Mom, hi! I thought I heard people out here. What a wonderful surprise! Who's this? Oh, him, uh‐‐ This is Brady. He's‐‐ Well, how should I put this, he's, uh‐‐ I'm the boyfriend. (chuckles) (indistinct chatter) Look who I found lurking in the driveway. My globetrotting daughter and her boyfriend. Hi, everybody. ‐Hey, hon! ‐Hi, Dad. Hey, I thought you had to work? Winter storm Meghan had other plans, so we need a place to crash. Of course. Hi, I'm Bert, Nina's dad. Brady. ‐Boyfriend, really? ‐Yeah. So, can I get you some of my famous eggnog? I would love some, but unfortunately, we're not allowed to drink within 12 hours of the flight. We work together. Ah, another lunatic who thinks it's okay to work in the sky. ‐Suppose I am. ‐Air travel's never been safer, Dad. ‐Oh. ‐The planes practically fly themselves. BERT: Is that supposed to reassure me? I don't care what anybody says, you won't catch me up there again. One bumpy flight five years ago and I am out. Which is why Santa is probably going to be bringing us an RV for Christmas, as opposed to the African safari I was wishing for. ‐NINA: Sierra! ‐(gasps) If it isn't my favorite niece! ‐Merry Christmas, Aunt Nina. ‐Merry Christmas, Sierra. ‐Hi! ‐Hi. (chuckles) Is that your boyfriend? Yep, that's my‐‐ that's Brady, mm‐hm. Are you guys gonna get married? ‐Oh! ‐Well, sweetie, Auntie Nina isn't exactly the settling‐down type. All right, you know, look, things with Brady are very new, so we are taking it slow, step by‐‐ Who cares? You lock it in. That man is cute and then some. And so are you, honey. (laughing) Anyways, how is it possible ‐you've never told us about him? ‐Yeah. Oh, I'm sure I told you about him weeks ago. Potentially months ago. Uh, believe me, I think we would've remembered you mentioning a new boyfriend. And bringing him home for the holidays? It's a pretty major statement there, huh, sis? You know, it just happened, it's no big deal. It's just this thing that happened. Uh, hey, honey! Oh, excuse me. (chuckles) Boyfriend? How long have they been going out? I don't know. This is my brother, Will, and my sister‐in‐law, Marcy. ‐(chuckles) Hi. ‐Hi. So‐‐ So, how did you guys meet? That's a great question. (chuckles) It's actually quite a story. Oh, it sure is, yeah. Why don't you tell 'em? Oh, I'll let you tell it. You tell it so much better. (chuckles) (chuckles) Well, um, we‐‐ actually, we‐‐ we met in the security line at the airport. ‐Of course. ‐The craziest thing happened. I thought that he took my suitcase. So, she yelled at me ‐and rudely demanded it back. ‐(laughs) I wouldn't say‐‐ I wasn't rude, just insistent. Anyway, it turns out we have the same suitcase. You must've been so embarrassed. Yeah, I was, until he asked for my number. Which she gave me immediately. Only because he looked so desperate and lonely. I thought, why not have coffee with the poor guy, right? (laughter) And the next thing I know, here I am in Vernon Falls. It's a great story, it sounds just like a movie. We've been doing the long‐distance thing. Talking on the phone, meeting up when our routes intersect. So, where was the last place you guys met up? Oh, that was at ‐San Francisco‐‐ Diego. ‐San Diego. San‐‐ It was San Diego, we were in San Diego, but then Brady, so sweet, planned a romantic day trip to San Francisco. Oh, that's so sweet. Wow, I'm just amazed that you were able to keep this secret from the family. (chuckles) Well, you know, it wasn't intentional. You know? ‐Gosh, I'm hungry. ‐Starved. ‐Right? ‐Yeah.

Fine, I'm sure I'm gonna have to save your butt a couple times anyway. And what is that supposed to mean? Not exactly too quick with this whole charade. Oh, okay, and you are? Better than you. ‐Nina, hey. ‐Ivan. ‐ Merry Christmas. ‐ Hi, merry Christmas. I didn't expect to see you here. I didn't expect to be here. Oh, this is Brady. The boyfriend. I heard.

I have a really big morning, so... it was really great to see you, Nina. And good to meet you. If you ever need term life insurance, give me a call. Ivan, you are not leaving, are you?

Thank you. Yeah, I don't want to be tagged on Instagram. Oh. Sorry, too late. I just did. It won't happen again. BRADY: Well, growing up an army brat, it wasn't easy to have a Christmas like the ones I saw on TV. I mean, it was just a miracle getting a Christmas tree on a base in Seoul or Abu Dhabi. To be honest, when Nina told me that this was a tree trimming party, I thought, I should bring shears. ‐Or an ax. ‐(laughing) An ax would've made quite an impression. Will you be seeing your family at Christmas? Unfortunately, both my parents have passed, and I'm an only child. Oh. So, usually, when I'm not working, I'll spend Christmas in Encino with my Aunt Sofia and my cousins, but I can promise you, it does not hold a candle to this. Thank you. You're making my wife's night, Brady. You are good with parents. Are you sure you can't stick around for the Snow Ball? What's the Snow Ball? Oh, it's our annual Christmas gala for the children's hospital. You get dressed up, you bring a date. Everyone votes on their favorite couple. It's like prom for adults.

I think it would be nice to live in a town where people actually know each other. Each other and everyone's business. That's why I have a hard time with this place. People grow up here, they get married, they settle down. No one ever leaves. I mean, I moved to the city to go to pilot's school and live my dream and see the world. People here just don't really seem to relate to that, so... every time I come home, I just feel like an outcast. Yeah, I know that feeling. I mean, I'm always on the road.

Ever since her first flight, when the captain showed her the cockpit and gave her one of those little pins with the wings. (chuckles) I still have that, actually. Did she, uh, tell you about her Christmas world tour? Oh, come on, Will, why? Okay, okay, okay, so when Nina was about seven, she had this giant map on her wall, and she had this whole world tour mapped out. I'm talking like, I don't know, 20, 25 cities? So the plan was, she was gonna stay up on Christmas Eve, and then when Santa came, she was gonna, you know, convince him to let her tag along. So, she's all packed up, she's ready to go, but then she falls asleep and she missed Santa. So then the next morning, before anybody else got up, she called a cab and headed straight to the airport. ‐What? ‐(laughter) You really did that? She did. Yeah, the only problem though, hon? She didn't have a plane ticket, or the money to buy one. (laughing) I didn't even have enough money in my piggy bank ‐to take a taxi home. ‐(laughter) So... so when she calls me from the airport, I don't know whether I should laugh or cry, or ground her for a year. You should've grounded Will! He's the one who helped me pack. It was the least I could do. (chuckles) Hey, you know, um, you guys should come out with us tonight. Oh, yeah, to the Elbow Room. It's sort of become like a holiday tradition when everyone's in town. And there is a Santa contest. Oh, that sounds fun. Count us in. ‐MARCIE: Great! ‐All right. ‐Great! ‐Really? Why not? I guess I gotta get a Santa outfit? I got you covered. (chuckles) Fun! Hey, it's so good to see you. Hey. (chuckles) You know what? Let's get outta here. We just here.
