Tell me your name. Tell me your name. Tell me your name. I'm trying to save your life. There's a blood clot forming in your brain. You're not real. Open your mind. You're hearing that man's voice again. You need to see a doctor. You told anybody about this? No. I haven't told anybody. But I will if you don't see a doctor. That's going to ruin everything we've been trying to do. People are gonna talk. I'm not gonna be able to get a job. Mark. I just have to stop being so stressed out all the time. You need to see a doctor before it gets worse. Maybe what's happening to me is something I can beat. I'll talk you you later. Hey it's Catherine, leave a message after the beep and I'll return you call as soon as possible. Catherine, I'm sorry I ran off like I did. Please call. Open your mind. Jesus. This isn't real. Tomorrow. We have to see each other tomorrow. Your life depends on it. Now send me your memories. Now send me your memories. I'm Mark. Catherine. Mark, you won't die. What the hell? This isn't my apartment. I don't know who you are, but you better leave before I call the police, all right? This isn't my apartment. Let me in, I'll explain everything. I'm callin' the police. Mark. I'm trying to help you. How do you know my name? Pretty soon, you'll feel the pain in your belly. And the pain will only get worse. Call an ambulance, please. Call an ambulance. I need a doctor. What's happening to me? You felt that pain because I brought you into a parallel world. What? This world is exactly like the world you left, only you were never born here. You've never been at this apartment. You... Hypnotized me. No. If I hadn't brought you into this world, you would have died of a stroke last night. All of your memories came to me. I know everything about you. That's how I knew you were here. My throat. You need to absorb some of my energy. From your memories, I saw what clothes you like to wear. In a little while, you'll have your spirits back. That man in that house looks exactly like your father. Came here because you have a connection to him. In order to adjust in this world, you have to be near all the people to whom you have a connection. You and I also have a connection. We have to be near each other. Do you understand? We can't be separated... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, go. Open up, it's me. What do you want? I know about him. Who? Don't look. Just call the police. What for? He hypnotized me, made me do whatever he wants. Oh, you're nuts. Dad, please. Please help me. Who the hell said I was your dad anyway, asshole? You're nuts. Get outta here. Dad? Dad? Dad! Look, you better go. I am callin' some buddies who will kick your ass. Call the police! Shit. Leave me alone. No. Leave me alone, leave me alone. I told you, we have a connection. We need each other to stay alive. In their computers in there, there's no record of you. No birth certificate, no nothing. Do you remember your social security number? Yeah. Tell it to them, and if it comes up on their computers, they won't come up as you. I've been able, learned how to create identification that no one can dispute. I can teach you to survive. If you follow my instructions, you'll never feel pain again. Let's go inside. Andrew. This can't be happening, this can't be real. First time I saw proof of all this, I felt the same way you feel now. Like you, I thought I was going crazy. I was 17, heard a voice in my head. Definitely thought I was going crazy. It was the voice of an old man. An old man pulling me into his world. Saved my life. My dad, or... The man who looks like my dad. Will he be in every world I go to? Everyone you've ever known will be in every world we go to. Everybody? Yes, but they won't know who you are. She's exactly the same. Everything you adored about her. Dr. Nelson, you are needed in the emergency room. Dr. Nelson... Hi. Hello. I'm thinking about applying for a job here. I was wondering, could I ask you some questions about the place? Sure. Do you mind if I sit? Oh, go ahead. So what kind of work do you do? I can cook. That's good, our cafeteria could really use some help around here. Is something the matter? I feel like I've seen you around somewhere. I just moved here. Anyway, I think you'd like working here. The people are nice, fair. My lunch break's almost over. Good luck on your job search. Thanks. I'm Mark. Catherine. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. I hope we get a chance to talk again soon. That would be... Catherine? Catherine? I drank too much coffee, I'm dizzy. I gotta get back to work. - Bye. - Bye. Anna Gramly, report to the nurse's station. Something strange happened. When she shook my hand, it was like her mind went blank. Did you hear a humming sound? I think I did. That's weird. My throat, my throat. Beginning to tighten. Who is that? Don't talk. Andrew, please. Tell me who that is. I'll take them off when you fully understand why this has to be done. What are you doin' with the needle? What are you doin' to him? He has to be awake for this to work. Now he's ready... And I'm ready. Ready for what? What are you doin' with the knife? Jesus. You need to absorb this monster's energy. Feel better? I feel... At peace... Like you've never felt before. This is wrong. Just let me show ya what kind of monster he was. How many more innocent people do you think he would have killed if I hadn't stopped him? He even thought he could pay me to let him go. In every world I've gone to, there've been monsters like him. We might not be able to kill 'em all, but even the few we kill will save a lot of innocent people. Don't you think that's a good thing to do? The old man taught me to always have a couple of those monsters tied up where nobody can find 'em. If you don't keep me alive, I can't keep you alive. You're not putting any sauce on yours? It's not poisoned. That's not much pasta. All I need. I've lost the ability to taste and feel some things but other sensations have become even stronger. I can feel the ticking of the second hand like the beat of a heart. Enjoy it while you can. I prepared a room down the hall for you to sleep in. Having trouble falling asleep? Yeah. Music? And something to read always helps. Here, I'll give you somethin' to read. World War II. Japanese soldiers. Killed more than a million Chinese civilians, women and children among 'em. Believing that they were doin' it to protect Japan, to make their families safe at home. We dropped tons of incendiary bombs on Japan, burning more than a million Japanese civilians, women and children among them, telling ourselves that we were doin' it to protect our country. To make America safe. This kinda thing has been going on for a long time. I know it's difficult reading about such things but it'll toughen you up. Goodnight, Mark. Goodnight. I look terrible. No you don't. Yes I do, I haven't put on any makeup. Honey, you're too early. I look terrible. No you don't. Yes I do, I haven't put on any makeup. Honey, you're too early. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. I'm sure when my boss arrives, he'll let me leave as soon as I want. We have to adjust our plans. What happened? It turns out there's more work for me to do than I thought. They're things I need to do now. Andrew. Are you tryin' to find a way to tell me that it's over? No. You don't sound too convincing. I'm not sure of much, except that I love you... More than I can say. I read all of it. Bad times. They were. So, Catherine's gonna be getting off work, off her night shift in a few minutes and I was wondering if I could go see her. Please. Morning. Hi. You got the job here? Not yet, actually I still wanted to see if I could ask you a couple questions about this place. Do you wanna get some breakfast, maybe talk a little? Thanks, but I don't think that's a good idea. Maybe another time? Probably not, that's my boyfriend. - Hey. - What's up? Babe, this is Mark. He's tryin' to get a job here. Oh. How's that goin'? Not too good. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that man. There's lots of jobs though, I'm sure you'll find somethin'. - You hungry? - Yeah. All right, hope it works out for you dude. You too. - Bye. - Bye. I know what you're going through. In some worlds, the one I love wanted someone else. Some ways, it's worse when they love you. The year you have with 'em flies by and... And what? The day you enter their world, an illness starts in them. No. Within a year, they die. There has to be a way to keep Catherine alive. If there was, I would tell you. I've seen it happen, over and over. That's why I told you that you have to toughen up. What's wrong? I'm losing my spirits. You're gonna have to drive. There's the house. The man I tied up is in the garage. Look in his pocket. Check the phone. He killed her. Keep checkin' the phone. He killed her too. Use the needle. He's waking up, you have to do it now. If I die... you'll die. Cut his throat. Andrew. Andrew. You did the right thing. All right, yeah, I'll bring cash. You make sure he gets the best ID possible. We'll be there in about an hour. Okay. What ya thinkin' about Mark? You have any kids? No. It's impossible for people like me and you to have kids. What you gotta do, what people like me and you gotta do, is never stop focusing on the future. Keep your mind on possibilities. If you can stay focused on possibilities, you can hang on. I wanna go see my dad. The man who looks like my dad. Sir, I don't, I'm not from here, I don't know anybody yet. I'd like to talk to you. About what? I'll be movin' into an apartment down the street. So? Sir, you remind me of somebody that tried to help me. I still need help. Advice on all kinds of things. We could hang out at a bar, you know? You pick the place, I'll buy the beer. I don't know con you're pulling but if you're buyin' the beer, I'll play along. Okay, well I'll come by in a couple days. All right. See ya around. Well he's not my dad but he acts exactly like him. When the old man pulled me into his world, I did just what you did. I went searching for the ones who looked like my family. I only found my mother. Of course, she didn't know who I was, got scared, left the shack she was stayin' at. Mark, energy we get from the monsters we kill slows down our aging. What? Yes, yes. I was born before the Civil War. Slave on a Georgia plantation, 1855. Wait, time out... Time out nothing, time out for you. Let me finish before you start asking a lot of questions. Being born a slave on a Georgia plantation... Horrible. Always something to fear. But my mom could always find a way to make us happy. Then the Civil War came and my mother had to work like an animal to keep us alive. And then the war worsened, and she began to have to steal, and do whatever else she could to keep us alive. One day, she found a knife in the burned-out shack we were stayin' in. She told us don't you leave this house until I come back tonight or tomorrow, whenever I get back. Don't you leave. And she left, and she came back the next morning. With food. She kept on going out with the knife until the Civil War ended. Her eyes were always on something way far away, something only she could see. Then I got tuberculosis, and I began to hear the old man's voice in my head. The old man who took me outta my world into his world. Saved my life. I'm tellin' you this because I've seen worse. I've seen wars, I've seen massacres, I've seen famine, but you know what? I've also seen how fiercely people will struggle to stay alive, just for the hope of a better future. The day you enter their world, an illness starts in them. Within a year, they die. No. No. No. You need to absorb this monster's energy. How many more innocent people do you think he would have killed if I hadn't stopped him? In every world I've gone to, there've been monsters like him. No. Morning. You get any sleep? Not much. That's something else you're gonna have to get used to. Coffee helps. Want some? Sure, thanks. Want milk in your coffee? Ah, no thank you. I made it a little bit too strong. Milk's gonna make it taste a lot better. I'd like just a little bit then. Still too strong? No, it's good. Mark, tonight my year will be up. I will be pulled out of this world into another world. You and I will never see each other again. There's somethin' different you have to do to stay alive in this world to make it into another world. Something different? Yes. Sorry, I can't keep my eyes open. What did you put in this? Just something that will help you sleep a bit. Andrew, I trusted you. The old man told me that people like you and me and all the other people that go from world to world are all the same. We have a darkness in us that makes us capable of doing horrible things. When we enter a new world, our dark side merges with the darkness of the monsters we kill. But we're also connected to the energy of people like Catherine. And Gloria. People who don't mean anybody any harm. In order to stay alive, we need their energies. Andrew. Please. There has to be another way. The old man tried to tell me there was another way, but he was lying. He began to love the killing, and when he saw that I didn't love the killing, he tried to kill me. But I killed him first. You're a monster. Maybe. Hey babe, welcome back. I'm glad to be back. You sound tired. Honey? Been working a lot. I really missed you. I miss you too. Okay, I'll see you soon okay? See ya. Baby. What's wrong? Just thinkin' about all the work I have to do. Let's go get some coffee. Okay. Something the matter? No. Andrew, open your mind. This will only stop if you're feeling pain. Don't do this. No, no, no, no. This will paralyze you for about a minute, then you'll get your strength back. Now get up. Don't do this. Mark, there's no other way. What about Gloria? Do you think I enjoy killing the ones I love? I told you, the minute we enter their world, they begin to die, and they die a horrible death! How many times have you seen that happen? It happens to all of them. Pick up the knife. All it takes is a cut across Catherine's jugular vein. That's all you need to do. Time is running out. This is the last time I'm going to ask you. Do it. Okay. I'll do it. The knife is on the floor, pick it up. Okay, okay. I got it. I got the knife. Cut it quickly, and she won't feel too much pain. Catherine. Catherine, listen to me. I'm sorry. Let them go! Let 'em go, let them go. Look at me. Look at me. You're not gonna do this. Andrew. You're dead. You can't feel anything. I am not. Unfortunately, I can feel all sorts of things. Andrew, please, please. The old man could have been telling the truth. The old man was lying. You don't know that for sure. Close your eyes, Gloria. Please close your eyes. Andrew. Andrew, please. I hope that the old man was telling the truth about there being another way. I'm tired of killing. Mark, we're in the new world. You have to wake up. Good morning, darlin'. Thank you for a lovely evening. Let's get you inside and put you to bed. Ha, you should have seen your face. You should have seen your face. We're not absorbing his energy. American Realty, how many I help you? I'm lookin' for a house to lease. Okay, well you've called the right place. My name is Gloria. I only offer the best in quality, so how long a lease are you looking for? Let's start with a year. Can I come by your office tomorrow? Sure. Well what time works best for you? 9am. 9am it is, Mister? Andrew James. 9am, Andrew James. Okay, I look forward to seeing you tomorrow, thank you. What happened to Catherine? I don't know, we're in the new world. I don't know what the rules are here. Is there another Catherine here? Probably, I just talked to another Gloria. I wanna see Catherine. I won't be any trouble, I swear. Do you think it'll hurt her if I get too close? I don't know. I don't know how long she'll live, how long you'll live, or how long I'll live. I don't know. There's someone else I wanna see. Looks like they're all in this world. Yes. So that means those other ones are here too. I'm pretty sure I know why the old man never wanted to try the new way. He would have died, like I'm dying. What? Wait, what? No. Go. Do whatever you want in the time you have left. Beautiful. Thank you. You're not gonna die. I am. If my memories enter you... Write 'em down as quickly as you can, before you forget them. I've already forgotten most of your memories. I always told myself that I had to kill the ones I loved to save many more. Now I finally see the truth about myself. I so loved being alive, even though I could barely feel much of anything. It was the things I'd loved that kept me going. Horrible world. Hold onto what you love, and you'll hang on. I hope you live long enough to see all the things I've seen. All of the beauty. Scott Fletch. Scott Fletch. Scott Fletch. Nice to meet you too. Hello. Is this a Mr. Scott Fletch? Yeah, who's this? Hi, I am calling to see if you'd be interested in an investment opportunity, sir. How did you get my number? Sir, some of my associates recommended you to me as a potential client. Okay, what did you have in mind? Hi. Hello. Mr. Fletch? Have we met? Well no, but actually what happened, I called about an investment opportunity. You said you were very interested. Yeah, I think I remember your voice. Very sincere. Well, would you like to come in? Sure, thank you very much. 911, what is your emergency? Hi, there's a man who's been killing people. I have him in handcuffs. He's being held at the address 232 Sinoma Blvd. Los Angeles, California. And what is your name sir? It's okay, I just gave you the address. Our kind will never die, but we definitely feel pain. In every world you go to, you'll find me there. Let me show you what I've learned. Open your mind. Andrew, only pain is waiting for you.
