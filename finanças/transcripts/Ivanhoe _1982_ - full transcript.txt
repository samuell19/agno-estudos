- You're about to see a story of bold knights and beautiful maidens. - A story of love and hatred and prejudice. - Though our story is old, - the love, the hatred and the prejudice are ever new. Help! Ah! Holy god of Abraham, spare me! Silence, if you value your life! [gasping] Holy, father, I beg you. Silence. Follow me. This way. You see. They've been lying in wait for you. Where is he? Where is this Jew? Well? He's gone, Sire. Gone? Disappeared! Imbecile! You let him get away! They're Normans. Saxons or Normans, what does it matter to me? Do I rejoice because the brave Normans cross the channel and defeat the brave Saxons? What's the difference? They both treat us like dogs. You call them brave knights. I call them thieves. A rich merchant, I fear, is fair game. No matter. You have saved my life, and I am forever in your debt. [horses whinnying; riders retreating] If you keep to this road any longer, sir, no one can help you. I shall be lost otherwise. I know this country. Where are you bound? To Ashby, the great tournament. Why, then, we can travel together. Ahhhh. May I ask who you are, that I may thank for my deliverance? Merely a poor pilgrim returning from the Holy Land. Ah! Come. To waste any more time here would be dangerous. There. There lies Ashby. Ahaaa. The blessings of Jacob be upon you, pilgrim. How am I going to repay you? Oh, I want nothing. You shall have a horse and armor for the tournament. But, how did you know, that I... Ha, ha, I see who that was... beneath your robe. The chain mail of a knight and the golden spurs. You shall have everything that you need. Then, I must warn you, sir, both horse and armor may be lost in the jousting. Ahhh, that's impossible. Your lance's good use will be as powerful as the rod of Moses. [trumpet blare announces the tournament at Ashby] [crowd cheering] [crowds applause the entertainments] [knight's horse neighs] [crowds brawling] [knights suiting up in preparation for the joust] knight Front de Boeuf knight De Bracy My little Pouqant, eh? Ha, ha, ha. knight Brian de Bois-Guilbert [a knight Templar] [arrival of Prince John and retinue] [acting king] [crowd greets the prince] Cedric, the Saxon. [John and Fitzurse, his advisor] [Cedric with son Athelstane] "Norman dogs!" [Wamba in rear] - Careful master. -Huh? - They say Prince John has ten thousand ears. Well, let him here me, then. I'll say it to his face. [Isaac of York arrives with daughter Rebecca] [crowd applauding arrival of Cedric's ward Rowena] Who is that? That's Cedric of Rotherwood, a Saxon lord. I meant the lady. Oh, that's his ward the Lady Rowena from the royal land of Alfred the Great. She's beautiful. If a Saxon can be called beautiful. [trumpets announce to start of the contest] Challengers! Reginald...Front de Beouf! [cheers] Maurice De Bracy! [cheers] and Brian...Guilbert! [cheers] [Brian de Bois-Guilbert selects a lady to honor] [Rowena, Cedic's ward?] [or Rebecca, daughter of Izaac of York?] [her father refuses] [crowd cheers Prince John] [ de Bracy] Listen to the crowd. Prince John is well accepted here today. He would do well to take over the throne now, before King Richard gets back from the Holy Land. Richard dies the moment he returns. [the Norman contenders salute Prince John] Fitzurse. - Yes, Your Grace. Are we ready to begin? Well, there's still the choosing of a queen for the tournament, sire. Um. If it would please, Your Highness,... - Um? - ...my daughter, perhaps. It might appear unseemly to announce you daughter before the tournament has yet begun. Let the gallant knight who conquers the field here today make the choice. These three noble challengers will undertake all comers. Each challenger may be selected by touching his shield with a lance. If the shield is touched with the reverse end of the lance, then sharp points will not be used. But, if the sharp tip of the lance touches the shield... then the combat is understood to be...with sharp weapons. If any knight should break the lance of all three challengers here before me, then Prince John will declare that knight the victor in this day's combat. The prince wants the victor to choose the queen. Prince John has declared the victor will have the honor of choosing our queen of love and beauty! [cheering] Normans. All three Normans. [to Athelstane, his son] Is there a Saxon to meet them? Tomorrow. I fight tomorrow. [Lady Rowena laughs] [challengers to the three Normans] [applause] Are you looking for someone? [opposing challengers each select a Norman shield] Your Highness, no sharp points will be used. [John] How disappointing. [King's retinue laughs] [de Beouf laughs, meaning this will be easy] [cheering the Norman knights] [marshal signals beginning of combat] [Norman unhorses opponent] [general crowd boos. Prince's supporters cheer] [Norman knocks over both horse and rider opponent] [loud cheers] Is there no one here, no one to stop them? Tomorrow. [again the Norman wins] Who is he? - Look again, master. - Huh? Perhaps you should ask, Who was he? A Saxon? Without question. Whew... Have we no better than this? We have, My Lord. His name is Ivanhoe. Your son, master. I have no son. You may have disowned him, but he's still your flesh and blood, and worthy of his Saxon name. He is worthy of scorn and nothing else. [Wamba as jester] Oh, what a disgrace. Oh, what a pity. My son ran off and left the city. [the fighting continues and Normans continue to win] Next! [Saxons reluctant to fight on] Who's next? [No one steps forward] Ahhhhh. [Prince's advisor laughs] Your Grace, there are none left now who will meet the challengers. [an unknown knight rides out of the woods] [Cedric shouts] Is it possible. Will they let these Normans invaders take the day? The very honor of England is at stake. Surely you... [the hooded knight continues to approach] How annoying that we should finish so early. So quickly. And yet our company to know that the three strongest knights on this field, are loyal only to you. Your Majesty. [the stranger enters the lists] [cheering arises] [cheering becomes jubilation] It's him. It's him. The Pilgrim. Ah, Desdichado, the Disinherited Knight. Welcome. You have your choice. However, the outcome will remain the same. I'm disappointed. Would that I trade places with you Front. Never. This one is mine. [horse neighs twice] [Front de Boeuf is knocked off his horse] [wild cheers in the Saxon section] [victor's horse rears] A Saxon. I'll wager he's a Saxon. [Brian] May I hope that you will now give me the opportunity? [strikes De Bracy's shield] What a shame, Brian. Now, you will never get your chance. [horse neighs, then whinnies] [De Bracy falls quickly] [cheers] Who is he? Find out who he is. [Rowena, Cedric, Rebecca and Isaac wildly happy] Have you confessed yourself this morning that you peril our life so frankly? The sharp end! They will use the points. Prepare yourself, then. Look your last upon the sun. [both lances broken] [neither knight unhorsed] [Brian Guilbert knocked off] [loud cheers] [rears horse in salute] [Brian draws sword] [victor draws sword] Hold it! You're allowed the lance only. [Marshal] You're not allowed the sword! You, Disinherited Knight, we proclaim you the champion of this day's tournament! [loud cheering] We shall meet again tomorrow. When there are none to part us! Brave knight, we commend your valor. and we award you this valiant steed to match your courage. [horse brought forward amidst cheering] [Rebecca falls in love] You call yourself the Disinherited One By what other name shall we know you? [silence] As a stranger in our land, you may require assistance in your choice of the Queen. Let us say to you that the fair Alicia is considered the first in beauty as in place. Would you present your lance? You may now indicate your choice. [he rides past Alicia amidst cheers] [he stops in front of Rebecca and nods] [but turns back and presents the crown to the Saxon Lady Rowena] [ heralds] - Largesse! Largesse to the gallant knight -loomed against the Queen of Love and Beauty. [crowd] Long live the Queen of Love and Beauty! [Rowena, too, falls in love] [crowd] Long live the Queen of Love and Beauty! You can't just waste your whole life in bitterness, father. Bitterness? You speak of bitterness? What would you have me be? Our Lord and Master, Prince John, demands twice the contribution I gave him last month. Contribution. [Sigh] It's a ransom. But surely King Richard will return to England and resume his throne. What difference does it make to us, Richard or John, in this... ...wicked country, we shall always be persecuted. No. All Christians are not the same. Think of the gallant knight who fought today. Ah, now there was a brave and noble youth. I'll wager that pilgrim was Jewish. Yes, Thieslen? There's a stranger at the door, sire. He wishes to speak to you. Does he look dangerous? I don't believe so. He wears the garments of the pilgrim. Ahhhh. Veil yourself. My friend. Sir. Forgive my intrusion. I am here to pay my debt to you. Debt? What debt? I owe you my life. Not at all. My daughter, Rebecca. I am honored. You owe me nothing. You paid me back in full today at the tournament. May I offer you a goblet of wine. Nevertheless, I have brought your horse, and I have here the price of the armor. Keep them. They're yours. Why, I feel I must at least pay you something. My father owes you a far deeper kindness than any steeds or arms could pay. Please, let us look upon it as our debt to you. For his life. If that is your wish. Eh, your wine? Forgive me, please. I must prepare myself for tomorrow's encounter. Sir, you've been far too generous. I'm honored to have met you. Thank you I bid you goodnight. [music weaves a spell of romance] [Lady Rowena] [Wamba, the jester] Whoo, whoo!.... Whoo. Oh, you frighten me. - Wait. I will leave and come back again. - Whoo, whoo. There. - Are you frightened, now? Tell me. Tell me at once. Who was the mysterious knight? Who was he? Whoo... Oh, Wamba, please, don't play games with me. What did he say? His voice could not be heard. His face. His eyes, his nose, his mouth could not be seen. Why? He wasn't there! Oh. Gone! Into the night. A good knight. Gone, into the good knight. I think it best. Best? Would not Ivanhoe, if he were here? Would not Ivanhoe be jealous! Reign, you champion. He'd have no reason. I am faithful to Ivanhoe. Ummm? Would Cedric marries you to the noble hog, Athelstane? Never. He will insist. And I will refuse. [Ivanhoe, "The Disinherited Knight" at prayer] Halt! Wamba. Well? What did she say? Did you talk to her? She hasn't forgotten me? Well, tell me, she hasn't forgotten me. My Lady is fair. She would have a prayer. For me? For the brave knight who won the day. [blowing] Are they the same? What's your name? Be gone, you knave! Whoo.... Be gone! [the second day of the tournament] [cheering the arrival of Prince John] [Cedric and Rowena arrive] [herald] The Queen of Love and Beauty shall be guided to her throne by our royal liege Prince John! [cheers and applause] Where is Athelstane? Master, that is a question. Is he getting ready for the combat? He's a guest of the noble lord Gurthog. When I saw them last, they were eating venison, an enormous beast! Be it known, it is forbidden to thrust with a sword. You may strike only. A mace or battle axe may be used at pleasure. But the dagger is forbidden. Any knight unhorsed may renew the combat on foot. Any knight who breaks the rules of this tournament, will be subjected to public ridicule and stripped of his arms! [sides will attack en masse] Glory to the brave! Very well, let them begin. [marshal signals] [a full war combat attack] [Cedric and crowd cheers the melee] [the acting king enjoys it] [the three Normans single out Ivanhoe for revenge] You can stop the combat at any moment. Stop it? By the light of heaven, I will not. He gains the prize yesterday. Let the others now have their turn. [Ivanhoe is struck in the back with the head of a lance] [a new contender knight rides onto the field] [a true Black Knight] [the Black Knight attacks the Normans] [Ivanhoe weakens] [the Black Knight comes to his aid] [Ivanhoe unhorses De Bracy] [and prepares to continue the fight of yesterday] Hold! Stop the conflict! [the Black Knight leaves the field] [Ivanhoe displays the victory sign] [Cedric unknowingly cheers his own son] Honor to the brave! Glory to the brave. To the brave! Glory to the brave! [crowd] To the brave! Glory to the brave! [Ivanhoe refuses assistance] [and kneels for the crown] His head must be bared to accept the chaplet. Ivanhoe! The chaplet, My Lady. I bestow upon you, Sir Knight. This chaplet as a gift of honor for this day's victory. And upon these fearful wounds no worthy wreath of chivalry could ever be placed. Help him. Help him! Your own son! Will you do nothing? My son has left my house. He has deserted my country. He has forsaken the Saxon cause. He is no son of mine! [Rowena sobs] Please, help him quickly, father. How? Take him to our house. But he's a Christian. By our laws we can't deal with him, except in commerce. He is gravely wounded, and by our hearts we cannot refuse him. Think, if he should die in our care. He will not die, unless we abandon him, and if so, we must announce it for his blood to God. Quickly, his enemies are all about. [De Bracy] Wilfred of Ivanhoe, there is more to this than one day's battle! If Ivanhoe has returned from the Holy Land, can King Richard be far behind? Well, let him come. We'll crown his brother before Richard can gather his forces. Then we'll take Richard and welcome to him. I, Brian de'Bert make you this solemn promise I shall meet this... Wilfred of Ivanhoe in mortal combat,... and send him to eternity. Stay there! Get back there, get back. Get back. Who is it? Who is it that bears him away? Someone thought kind of him with your grace. On the road. My Lady. [gasp] [breathing heavily] You. My father and I. We bought you here to care for your wounds. We have special herbs, ways of curing wounds. Though we never inflict them. Herbs. Secret preparations handed down to us since the days of Solomon. You should be able to bear armor again within eight days. You may rest at our home in York, until you health is restored. We leave in the morning. Is there not [gasp] someone else here in Ashby who, who could look after me until I... Not a step forward, today. My dear, noble maiden, I... No, I am not a noble. I am but a poor Jewess. Is it our race, then? Is that why you do not wish to travel with us? I, uh...I, uh...I have no wish to inconvenience you. I accept you service, gratefully. Rest, now. I leave you. Your Majesty. Arise. Did you find him? At the house of Isaac. The Jew of York. They plan to take him to York in the early morning. [sigh] That was a stroke of good luck. I shall meet with Willoughby, Forbes and Willister at York within the week. All my forces will be gathered there to challenge my brother. You're traveling alone? I must for the moment. You may retire, now. - Oh, and Philippe. - Your Majesty. A good night's work. Thank you, Your Majesty. [sounds of festivities at the Castle of Ashby] [Prince John's high festival banquet] [convivial laughter] Well, where is she? Where is our Queen of the tournament? Is she...? Yes. She is your ward, is she not? Where is the Lady Rowena? She is exhausted by today's events, she... begs leave to decline your courteous invitation. We are not accustomed by such a refusal from our appointed Queens. It is traditional that they attend. Your customs are not our customs. Well! Perhaps you'll not object if we drink a beaker to the champion of this passage of arms, to your son, Wilfred of Ivanhoe? I cannot drink. To your own son? He deserted us. He left his house, his country, to fight in foreign lands with your brother, King Richard. Then let us hope my brother holds him in more esteem than you. [laughter] I cannot forgive him. I will not forgive him. A willful youth who refuses the commands and customs of his fathers. I fill my cup. To Cedric...himself. This...ward of yours, the Lady Rowena. Yes? A rose of loveliness. And I trust a jewel of worth. A Saxon of large possessions. It is my intention that she marry this gallant and noble knight, Athelstane. The last of the royal line of Saxons. - Uh. But, then...she is a minor, is she not, and she is therefore at our disposal in marriage. Indeed. Uh, what do you think, De Bracy? I'm told you're attracted to the Lady. Would you find it pleasing to take her as your bride? If her lands are to my liking,... I will hold myself bound to your Highness' wishes. Huh. The day my ward marries a Norman, will be that Norman's last day on earth. Hold. Sit down! Both of you. We've invited these honored guests here this evening and they shall remain honored guests. We've offered a toast to Cedric of Rothrwood and now we pray you,... name us some woman in return. It is a hard task for the conquered to sing the praises of his conqueror. Yet, I will name a Norman, even though he led my only son astray he is still the best of your unfortunate race. I drink this goblet to the health of King Richard the Lion-hearted. [some join in] And now I hope you will excuse us, we have remained here long enough. Up, noble Athelstane. We bid you good night. I'm afraid, Your Majesty, that the Saxon dogs have retreated in triumph. It isn't possible, is it? Could Richard be back in England again? What does it matter. You have reserves, us here of Maurice de Bracy, Front de Boeuf and my own humble sort. Enough for an army! [laughter] Here is my toast and solemn pledge: To Prince John, our next king of England. [all] Prince John! [chanting over and over] Prince John! - Ahhhh. Oh! - Where is she now. Where is the Lady Rowena? - Weeping. - Weeping? [Rowena sobbing] [door opens] Come, we must leave at once! Would you go without your son? Ivanhoe has chosen to go his own way. So be it. - He chose? - He's better fitted now to do the juggling tricks of the Normans, than uphold the honor of his English ancestry. Who was it that defeated the Normans - at the tournament? - Silence! Not another word. We leave at once. [gasp] - Your Highness. - Yes. This arrived this morning... from France. Noooo! What is it? Uh...the Devil is unchained. - Take heed... - Richard? He's escaped from France. He's back in England. We mustn?t lose a moment, Your Highness. Call your troops together at York, and meet, whatever force he has head-on! Your Highness. At once. My friends. My friends, we ride for York. York? We join Prince John within the fortnight. For what purpose? For the purpose of beating King Richard. At last. York is only a three day journey. We have plenty of time. Of course. You shall be my guests at Torquson on the way. Tankards and venison enough to fill even your fat bellies. What do you say? [laughing] Ahhhhh! [Isaac and Rebecca's caravan with the injured Ivanhoe] Halt! Halt, William. Here, what are you doing? Why did you stop? Bandits. Bandits, there are no bandits! Yeah, in the woods, maybe. We're leaving. You can't do that. You can't leave us here! No? We're going. No, stop! You can't take those horses. Those are my property! Thieves! Thieves. [Rebecca checks on Ivanhoe] Here. Drink this. [Ivanhoe coughs] There. Rest now. Rest. [Ivanhoe breathes heavily] They were hired to take us to York! They've got my money. Why should they care? We are deserted. Oh, God of Abraham, what have I done? Why must they smite us so? Father, look! May God make them merciful. Hold. I greet you warmly, sir. I trust you are in good health. Who are you? Speak plainly, infidel. I'm Isaac of York. I hired a guard of men to escort us to York, but they've deserted us, as you can see. Why? They say there were bandits in the forest, but, heh, heh, who am I to talk. I beg you to let us travel under your protection. Dogs if infidels, out of the way! Sir, may I speak, please. We have someone here. An old person who is gravely ill. I beg you to let this sick person be transported with care, under your protection. It is no concern of ours. Wait. If this poor person is truly in peril of life, and if these two kind and earnest people cannot defend themselves, well then we must, in all charity, give them help. So be it. They may travel in the rear. [horn blows a signal] What is it? What's the alarm? No alarm, sir. All is ready for you at the castle. We only wish to inform you, there is a party of Saxons in the forest there below. You know them? Cedric of Rotherwood, the Lady Rowena and the noble knight, Athelstane. How large is the party? Ten or eleven. Servants and all. My good friend, De Bracy, I wager that the hour has struck. What? It's time for us to deliver your wife. Your wife, De Bracy, is awaiting you. What was that? What? Ah, uh, nothing. Huh. [Saxon train attacked by screaming Normans] Forgive the intrusion, My Lady. I am pleased to announce that you are now the guest of my good friend, Front de Boeuf. I would sooner, sir, go with bandits. Much, indeed, that is what you are. De Bracy, are you certain that you want to marry this sharp tongue? [laughing] [de Boeuf] Well,... what have we here? [ Brian] I think, perhaps, that we have caught more than one bird on this occasion. [de Boeuf] An infidel, [Brian] and beautiful beyond belief. We can do you no harm, sir. We have an old woman here, who needs our care. She shall have it, I promise you. [Wamba] [Cedric] Dogs. Norman dogs. [Athelstane] Barbarians. But surely they will feed us. Stop. [De Bracy know the truth about the "old woman"] [first soldier] What is it? What affliction does this old hag have? [second soldier] I'll not go close enough to find out. [Ivanhoe coughing] Set her down. Set her down, please. [Ivanhoe groaning] Well, you may leave. [Ivanhoe groaning] There. It's all right. Shhhh. He's here. Rest easy, Ivanhoe. Don't be alarmed. Don't shout, I beg you. Where? Are we in York? We...we are prisoners. Here ye dog. Help me. Leave me alone. [Isaac thrown downstairs] [Wamba] Lost again. Lost again. What can I do? Taken my master. Left the fool. [Black Knight] Bandit or knave? I am neither, sir. Then, what are you? I am a fool...Wamba, for my master, Cedric of Rotherwood. The Saxon? A noble Saxon, sir. The prisoner. Prisoner? Where? Front de Beouf's castle. His ward, the Lady Rowena and noble Athelstane. There's also.... Would you mind, sir. Thank you. There's also Isaac, the Duke from York, and his daughter, Rebecca. They were abducted? Were, indeed, sir, most certainly. Just as surely as you and I. You? I? What are you talking about? Look about you, sir. The bushes are moving. Welcome, welcome, gentlemen. What do you wish, a fool or a knight? [Robert Locksley's men surround and capture them, not knowing who they are] [whistle warning] Release him. The Black Knight. The tournament at Ashby. You saved young Ivanhoe. You hold that against me? Against you? There is nothing more dear to me than the life of an Englishman. If you are as good an Englishman as you are a knight, then I hold you in esteem. Why do you pass our way? Shortest distance to York. Then you must stay awhile. Taste our hospitality. Please, I entreat you. Mutually loving this one. Help save my master. He speaks of Cedric of Rotherwood. The Lady Rowena. The noble Athelstane. Prisoners, all of them. Prisoners in the castle of Front de Boeuf. For myself, I would join any enterprise to save them. Where's Little John? He's away from Torquilton. And Will Scarlet? He's just arrived. Where's Friar Tuck? Did you call, my lord? - Where have you been? Why, at Vespers, saying prayers for all good Englishmen. It appears you've been drinking. More than usual. Perhaps a pious taste or two of our sacred wine. Do you think you are in suitable condition to give a service in combat? Hmmm, wazzz, a hissing here and a weakness here. I don't know... [splash] [general laughter] Yes, they have good passed away. I am ready! Take shun, my wicked priest! [Robin Hood] Let us be off, Black Knight. The fool will lead us to his master. [Front de Boeuf's castle] You want my life? Do you want my wealth? Is it too much for you Normans, that we Saxons still hold land in this, our own country? Very well, then. Put us to death. I ask only that you free the Lady Rowena in honor and safety. [Front de Boeuf laughs] [he laughs again] Norman swine! My God, who would have thought, that you, the descendent of Saxon kings, should the prisoner of a vile Norman in the very hall in which our ancestors held court. Perhaps, they'll hold us to a moderate ransom. Dogs. Oh, my tongue cleaves to my palette. If they ever gone to send us wine. [door opens] [door closes] Why don't you sit down, my lady. If I am in the presence of my jailor, sir, I will stand. Dearest lady, you are in the presence of your captive, not your jailor. I don't know you, sir. And no man dressed in spurs and wearing chains would intrude himself upon an unprotected lady. It's my misfortune, that I'm not known to you. I hope the name of De Bracy is known to all in deeds of chivalry. De Bracy? I see no deeds of chivalry on this day. You are unjust, Lady Rowena. Won't you allow at least the passion of a man drawn by your great beauty? Sir, you speak the common language of a minstrel. Perhaps bold language best justifies bold action. I tell you now, you will never leave this place unless you leave it as the wife of Maurice de Bracy. Your wife! Oh, I know, you have great pride. I admire that. It makes you even more suited to take your place beside me. When I do marry, sir, it will not be to one who despises the manner in which I have been brought up. Huh huh. [chuckling] Perhaps you dream that King Richard will resume the throne. That is an empty dream. I can promise you that. His fate will be as hopeless as that of Ivanhoe. What? Ivanhoe! Ah. Do I see a touch of tenderness, at last? Where is he? Do you know where he is? I do. Tell me, I beg you. He lies gravely wounded in a turret room above. I don't believe you. You didn't take the trouble to look. You traveled in the horse litter, with Isaac, the Jew of York, Now, were I to inform our host of this, Ivanhoe will no longer breathe, at all. Smile....dear lady. Simply smile at my proposal, and you will have nothing to fear. I can't believe that your purpose could be so wicked, and your power so great. There are others. Cedric, your guardian. The fate of all depends on your decision. Lady Rowena, I would rather you kept your original anger than this. Be assured, please. You have no reason for tears, as yet. I will leave you now. To dwell upon your decision. [door opens] [door closes]
