- Illusion, the art of tricking the brain, distorting the senses, challenging perception, you can't trust what you see even with your own eyes. Meet the masters of illusion. - Hello everybody, good evening and welcome to "Masters of Illusion." I'm Dean Cain. People have been fascinated by magic for centuries and I think it's wild myself to see someone who appears to be breaking the laws of physics and then try to figure out how they did it. So far I haven't done it one time but I promise you, you will make that very same effort many, many times tonight as you watch our masters perform. So are you ready to give it a try? - Yeah! - Outstanding. There's a stranger hiding in this garden, can you find him? The brain can be distracted. Our military men wear camouflage uniforms to blend in with nature, just as this figure is hidden among the flowers. And just like our illusionist tonight will hide their intentions. Time now for the always lovable antics of a magician who has as much fun performing as the people he's entertaining. There's always a lot of trickery involved when you interact with Chipper Lowell. - Thank you very much. This is... - Pana. - Pana and... Give it up for Pana and Ashley everybody. If you would, all right, would hold on to the bag for me? Excellent, and inside the bag we have a soda can. Now you may notice that there's nothing on it, I took all the print off because no product placement on my watch. All right. But we will initial this. Pana, how do you spell that? - P-A-N-A. - P-A-N-A, just like it sounds, Pana, very nice. Excellent, there we go. I notice you have a watch? - Yes. - Very good. Would you do me a favor, take that off and hold it in your left hand, if you would please, okay? Very nice, all right. We can see Pana written on there. I'm gonna have you hold this side of the bag, there you go. You hold that side. Okay, very nice. This can is going in here. With your other hand, reach underneath and just hold the bottom of the can. All right? You got it? Excellent. But big smile up, there you go, there you go. Big, good, good, good. All righty, excellent. Now, let me see your watch. Oo, this is very nice. Oh, wow, did you get it as a gift? - Yeah. - Oh, very cool, okay. That watch is also going into the bag. I want you to hold it as well. All right, very good. All right. Now, hold it just like that. I'm gonna have you guys release the items. On the count of three, they're gonna disappear. Are you ready? One, two, three, release. And they're gone Okay, we're gonna do a different trick. You know what? You know what happened, this is amazing. Your watch has turned into a can and your can has turned into a watch. They don't believe me. Reach in, grab the can. Grab the can if you would please, right? Yeah, show it to everybody if you would. Excellent. And then go ahead, reach in and grab the watch. See they've switched places, absolutely ama, Yeah, yeah, no show it to everybody. No, no go ahead. Are you kidding me? Okay, that's weird. You know what? I vanished one of them. Yeah, yeah. You know, the glass is half full kind of thing. Or maybe the soda can is half full. Yeah. Yeah. Just give it a little shake. Yeah, it's a little weird, huh? It's gonna get even weirder, all right? Cause I want you to see that the entire can all the way through all sides completely solid. Alright, I'll try not to hit the object inside. - Yeah, that would be great. - All right, there we... I'm gonna open this up very, very gently, sort of like breaking open a dinner roll. There is something inside, you can see it right there. Would you please take that out? Show it to everybody. Is that your watch? Yes, there we are. Thank you so much you've been awesome. Thank you, take a bow. - All the way from Stockholm, Sweden and a manic magic world that he has personally created, this is the very deceptive, Hakan Berg. Magic time. Oh, hoo. Hey! In your face. One more time. Oh yeah. Oh no. This is stuck. Hello. I can't hear the music. Gotta believe. I love you. - Next, Shoot Ogawa will make you doubt your senses when we come back. - The Japanese call him a genius. His manipulations are beyond explanation. So can he live up to his name tonight? We'll see. From Tokyo here is shoot Ogawa. - Thank you very much. Well, I would like to show you one of the classic magic because classic magic is a really good stuff. So I wanna show you. This is what I learned long time ago, I was around 10, 11, 12 years old, I don't remember exactly. Magic with four coins and four cards like this way. It looks really fast, but I hope you enjoy it. I have four cards and four coin like that way, okay? So it's very simple. I put card on the coin. You can see it, can't we? One, two, three. It's pretty interesting. When I was around 17 years old, I broke left hand three weeks before the magic competition in Japan. But I really wanted to do magic so I tried to create one magic with my right hand but I was a lefty. So today I would like to show you one magic with right hand exactly what I did when I was 17, okay? But I have two hands right now, why I have to do it. I know, like why we don't try something more, you know like a maybe if I have two hands, why we don't try something more than we think? I know, it's kind of strange because it's not a coin magic, it's like a four coin two cards, right? Four coins, two cards and one hand, and one hand. So now it's very tricky because you know, from center to right, you're gonna see this side, from center left, you're gonna see this side. Or if you want to, you can see just one eye and one eye so you can see really. Okay, let's do this. All right, simple thing is very hard. I Just toss coin and catch, which is very hard. Take coin, just hold it, just drop from here, just like that. So now you can see, it's two and two. - Oh. - Yeah, I know. It's very interesting, okay. Let's try it again. I just throw a coin from here to there, just like that. So now it's gone three and three, right. So now last things is here, I drop coin here. So very simple question, from this side, when I drop coin like that, how many coins there? Of course, you know, it should be like four coin like this where one, two, three, four. And how many coins there? Of course, as you know, it's one, two, three, and... four coin. So this is what I can do, hopefully, you like it. Thank you very much. - Technology seems to run just about every part of our daily lives now. So if you're anything like me, nothing really ever seem to work quite right. Well, our next performer seems to have the same problem. His solution is just as puzzling. This is Chris Funk. - So I've been trying to create the perfect illusion since I was 16 years old. Going a little further back, I've been trying to create the perfect song since I was four years old. And I've realized that writing the perfect song and creating the perfect illusion have a lot in common. So I wanna share a little something with you right here right now. Of course. All right. Gotta plug it in, I guess that would help. There we go, okay. So got a little looping pedal here. I'm gonna lay down some music for you live and we're gonna do the illusion to some live music. I've already taken the liberty of creating a bit of a beat and a baseline, you ready for this? - Yeah! It's coming together. The last one to bring it all together. And once you have that, that's when the magic can begin. But... Hang on. What if... Yeah, okay. - Oh! - Wow! - Next, the amazing card wizardly of Nick Dopuch. - Let's go into the audience right now and try to keep up with the fast paced St. Louis native magician who has never disagreed with himself. Don't be distracted by the very deceptive Nick Dopuch. - What's your name? - Denise. - Denise, pleasure. And you are? - Mark. Mark, all right, we're not gonna pay attention to Mark, we're gonna pay attention to you, right? So here's what we're gonna do, all right? If you would here, you can go and grab any card you want. Perfect, all right, seven of spades. All right, you can go and write your name on the face of that card, if you would. - Oh. - Yeah, you can sign that. And what's your name again? - Mark. Mark, I'm just gonna grab the four aces out of here that are surreptitiously next to each other. Don't worry about that. Which of those suits is your favorite? - The heart. - Do you know what the heart, you just said that. Okay, good. All right now, did you sign your card? - Yes. - All right, fantastic. All right, now here's what I want you to do. Oh, that's nice. Look at that. - It's a good signature. - I know it's a solid signature, ain't it? That's a really good. That's, that's, that's good, look at that, all right. So here's what we're gonna do, we're running back to those in a second. We're gonna use the aces to find your card, okay? Does that make sense? All right, one, you can find it directly, just looking right at it, all right? Two, you can distinguish all the other cards around it, which makes your cards stand out. Does that make sense? - Yes. - Okay, good. Whatever is coming with me on this system. So for instance, if I like, if I want to distinguish the four aces here, if I want to distinguish these four aces from the rest of the deck, for instance, what I could do is I could take those cards and I could put them right, pass them right to my hand like that. And then now we have four blue cards. - Okay. - I know. I know. I know. Don't worry, it's the age of the smartphone. I know this isn't impressive yet. It's okay, we're gonna get there though, okay? But I can find them whenever I want, all right? Now, which suit did you say your favorite was? - The heart - The hearts, okay. So now if we want to distinguish that one for instance. So for instance, we go like this, give a snap. Now we go like this. Now we still have our four aces. But now we've distinguished the ace of hearts by making it a read one. - Oh. - So now I can find it. Face up, face down, it doesn't matter. Whichever way I wanna find it, I know exactly where it's at. Now if I want to distinguish the ace of hearts even further, we waive it across the pack, give it a snap, and we distinguish the ace of hearts by turning it into... - What? - Denise's sign. And it is the only red card, absolutely. I know, right? Science. All right, good, Fantastic, We got that. - Okay, good. - Thank you very much Denise, but we're getting back to that in one second. Here's what I'd like you to do, sir, if you would. Mark, just go and grab any card you want. Alright, good. Fantastic, all right, show it around to everybody. Okay. Do you want to change your mind? - I do not. - Okay, good. All right, it's okay, I can see it. Go and scribble on the back there for me, just sign your name, draw a picture, whatever you want to do. All right, good. Yeah, I know, look at that. So we have Mark's card signed in the back. We have Denise's card signed here on the face. All right now, Denise, take those cards. I want you to cut them, just cut them wherever you like. Okay, good, fantastic, right. Place your card exactly where you cut. Complete the cut please. Alrighty. Now Mark, it's up to you. Let's see if you can find Denise again. All right, say stop whenever you want. - Stop. - Was that, I can go further if you like. - Go further. - Go further. - Stop. - Right there? - Yeah. - It's exactly where you want? I'ma mark it exactly where you stopped me, fair? Is that fair? - Fair. - That's fair, okay, good, fantastic. So now no sleight of hand, no tricks, no nothing. Mark has stopped me at any one of those cards. He stopped me at this card right there. Let's see if Mark found Denise. - No. No. No. - There you guys go, absolutely. You guys found each other for you. Mark, thank you so much. Denise, you take that home, you can frame it, tear it up, whatever you wanna do. Thank you all very much, I appreciate. Thank you guys very much. - Mai Wynn will make you doubt your senses When we come back. - Our next performer brings an extraordinary illusion to life right before your eyes. Please welcome Mai Wynn. - Well, that's all the magic we have time for tonight, but there's plenty more next time. We hope you'll join us again. Until then I'm Dean Cain. See you next time.
