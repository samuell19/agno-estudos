(engine humming) - [Man] What are we doing? - [Man] I don't know. - [Man] Yeah go check what's up. Tanner, what's going on? - [Tanner] It dead ends up there. - [Man] No, we can't go that way? - [Man] What did they say to you about this road right here? - [Man] I didn't ask them for directions to Seattle. - [Man] I think we're lost.

You're an adult riding a scooter with a latex animal mask stretched over your helmet. How can you possibly take yourself seriously? We all started riding together and going on longer and longer rides, it got more and more ridiculous. The idea to ride across the country was definitely not our idea that we came up with. There's an existing ride called the Cannonball Run. - He brought up this thing that happens every couple years where people ride long distances and it's kind of an unsanctioned group of idiots that decided they're going to do this endurance race. - I went home and immediately started checking it out and it had been going on since 2004 and it was every two years they would ride from one end of the country to the other. I had no idea where it was gonna go because we don't have any choice or control over where it starts and ends. - Justin sent me a text with just a single link to the Cannonball and I looked at it and told Justin he was crazy. - Barnes, Barnes sent us a Google Maps image of a starting point and you could see the bar that my wife was working at in the background of the picture. (soft music) - Everybody being just as ridiculous as each other and always trying to one up each other and being super ridiculous, they all said yes. - And I was like that's crazy, I'm in. - That's it, let's just go for it. - And I'm like I'm in, I'm in, let's do this, let's do this. - I'm like yeah, I'm down. - I was like oh, you guys are actually doing this? Add me to the group like I'm in. - Somehow I got roped into it. - It wasn't too crazy of an idea until we actually started really getting into it and then realized how much of an undertaking it would be. - What's the worst that could happen? Well, bad stuff, but we just went for it. (upbeat music) (surf music) - It was July in Jacksonville, Florida. - Our gear was showing up, our bikes were showing up, our riders were showing up, it was like a giant, shitty summer camp meet and greet and all these things were flying in from all over the country. We had an entire bedroom of our house just filled with Amazon packages. We were still putting shit together. Garage was running 24 hours a day pretty much. - [Man] Thanks for making your home our new clubhouse. (laughing) - Yeah, S-O-D J-A-X baby! - So the one thing on this ride that was the most instrumental piece of the puzzle was our Sena headsets. These are amazing pieces of technology and they are so powerful and I can't say enough about these things. - [Man] Barnes, did you turn your camera on? - But when you're putting them together make sure you read the instructions. - Hold the button down and it'll say like pairing, pairing, pairing and then you hold it down and it'll say pairing. - It's already paired. - Hey, listen! - I'm listening. - Hold your button down, hold your button down for six seconds, it'll say pairing mode. Hold your button down for six seconds, it'll say pairing mode. When his says pairing mode you tap your button again. I'm starting to get angry. (laughing) (engines revving) Teams of three, teams of three. (fireworks exploding) - [Man] We watched the fireworks on the Fourth of July, we stayed out way too late. (sirens wailing) (dance music) - The night before I had my own little moment of coming to Jesus where I wasn't sure I was gonna be able to do it, I wasn't sure the bike was gonna be ready, I was in charge of the equipment, I had no time, I had no money. - People didn't think we were going to ever make it. Nobody's ever done a cross country ride on a Zuma successfully and so here we are, 125 CC's, 40 miles an hour, 3700 miles, 11 days. - I hope to God this bike does not die. (garage door closing) (upbeat music) - So when we get to the starting line, we're all sitting around. Everybody is nervous as hell. - I was so nervous and anxious. Like this is two years, more than two years of my life. This is thousands of hours of countless nights of me not being able to sleep because I'm so stressed out about thinking that I feel responsible for everybody. If anybody gets hurt it's gonna feel like I'm never gonna be able to let it go. If we don't finish, I feel like I'm gonna let everybody down that we had hyped this plan up. - We don't know what's gonna happen, we don't know how this is gonna go, we don't know whether we're gonna make it, we're not, and I knew this was coming but I was trying so hard to delay it but we were probably five minutes away from putting our jackets on and riding away from our friends. I'm getting choked up thinking about it now. I went running in, I went running to everybody or by everybody in the lobby who's having a nice breakfast on the beach in the morning and just immediately went into that lobby bathroom with no door lock and just puked. - Justin's in the bathroom throwing up, Daddy is scooting around doing circles with his loud ass exhaust. (engine revving) The girls are giving teary goodbyes to Barnes when he's not throwing up and Joe. Ron is hugging Katie and it's this tearful, joyous kind of occasion. (upbeat music) I still couldn't even barely speak. I was so anxious and nervous that I was, it was just too much and I knew that I was just gonna start crying so we said goodbye to everybody and it was the cameras were on and everybody was honking and it was like this is happening. (horns honking) There's no escaping any of what's about to come. It was completely on me. (engines revving) (lyrics drowned out by bikes) ♪ And I'll forget you anyway ♪ - Drive away, I'm on the comm systems trying to choke out a thank you to everybody for trusting me and doing this with me. Not 10 minutes later, breakdown. - [Big Daddy] I had noticed my bike just spewing oil on the side. - We all stopped and we're sitting around trying to figure out what the hell Daddy did to his bike. - Well, I didn't think it was gonna be me. (laughing) I really didn't think I was gonna be the first one to break down but it just so happens I was I guess. - So we got about 11 miles before we had our first stop to wait for some idiot. - Everyone else was like blowing past us and I'm like great, we're already the laughing stock of this entire race. - Clean. (laughing) - Fuckers. - We just look like such losers. - Watching all the rest of the riders go by, honking, beeping, waving, we were the laughing stock of the entire Cannonball, that's for sure. - Luckily it was just me being an idiot, I got anxious and put to much oil in her. I spent like three days painting everything on my bike and I wanted it to look super fresh. Three days of hard work, done. - It was all back to normal. Bickering started, laughing started and it was like okay, this is exactly what we've done for weeks and months at a time back in Seattle for the last eight years and now we're just in Florida and it's no different and we have 10 hours we thought of riding to go. (twangy music) ♪ Run down motel ♪ ♪ End of the block ♪ ♪ Came all this way now ♪ ♪ You're too scared to knock ♪ ♪ Good times leaving you ♪ ♪ Last train pulling through ♪ And we just went and rode all the way through Georgia, dead armadillos everywhere, it stunk like a carnival. - The bugs were huge and kept hitting us in the face. (squeegee squeaking) - It is the hottest, most insanely humid shit hole that I have ever been through. - It was one thing after, we barely got to get comfortable on the first day, it was hang up after hang up and they were just being thrown at us all day. Somebody ran out of gas, a belt broke, somebody hit their kill switch on accident, actually I did and thought I broke down. We got crazy rain, lighting. - Whoa! - We got separated a couple times, this was like one of our first big breaks in communication and I'm trying to tell everybody to stop and everybody just rode off down the road. - It was like watching a slinky try and go down the road. We got pulled out in front and somebody's like ah, shit man, forgot my oil, I forgot this, it was just a complete catastrophic departure. ♪ Can't take this feeling ♪ ♪ Can't take this feeling ♪ - About five hours in, which is pretty much the most that I've ever been on a scooter at one time, five hours in I'm actually falling asleep. - There was nothing, there was no turns, there was no hills, it was just flat, shitty roads and you're just sitting there like (scooter engine humming) for fucking eight hours. - There was a moment where I was just like if this is what every day is gonna be like I'm gonna die. - We have to do this how many more times for how many more days? That was the worst feeling. I don't know if anybody else felt that. (engines revving) (horns honking) - Yeah baby! - End of that day I was like if this is how it's gonna be for 11 days, I'm just gonna hop off at the next stop 'cause this is fucking crazy. The daunting task of we still have a lot more to go, this is just the first stop, this seems like it's going to be the worst decision of my life. - Every scenario that we thought could've gone wrong short of somebody crashing happened on the first day. - When we started this thing part of our crowdsourcing was if we hit a certain amount of goal we had these challenges that we were all gonna do. - Eight riders, eight challenges, 11 days, the penalty if you decide that you do not wanna do your challenge or you fail at it you have the following consequences, you have the choice of either shaving one eyebrow or you have to cut your hair into a cul de sac and that means shaving the top of your head but leaving the rest of the hair present. - And we just drew a challenge out of a hat and my challenge was the unhappy camper and I had to sleep outside. (soft piano music) I basically slept with my eyes just barely open so I could see and I would hear footsteps coming and would just, don't say anything, don't move and maybe they'll leave you alone and a couple times I saw the footsteps stop and then they'd just keep going. And I was like yes, thank you, thank you for leaving me alone. I don't wanna talk to anybody tonight. I maybe slept an hour, maybe. My alarm went off at five and I was like it's morning. Got up, went into the room, grabbed my stuff, filled up my Camelback and shook everybody awake because I had no patience at that point. Like get up, we're leaving, we're leaving on time today. - [Justin] Starting. (engine revving) We were supposed to be out of here at, I don't have a watch on, at six o'clock. It's already close to a quarter after. - Good morning. (chattering) - [Justin] BD is, I don't know what you're doing. - Changing shoes, bro. - I wanted to get on the road like a half hour ago. I was ready at a quarter to six, like on my bike. - [Justin] Like we were supposed to. - You don't have to keep talking about it. If we're not on time, we're not on time. - [Paul] Well we just need to talk about what the term means and like we were up at a quarter to five in our room. - [Man] That's fine. - You were up way too early, bro. - Managing expectations was a huge part of the trip and one of the hardest parts for me was to be patient. I'm not a very patient person at all. We need to have expectations of if we're having a conversation and we say a certain time we need to at least try to adhere to that time. - Paul was just always pissed about people not being on time so you get that sense right away, it's like, okay, well this guy's got something he's dealing with. - Dealing with people like Joe who also likes to talk back a bit, in the morning was tough. - Yeah, so kick stands up doesn't really matter unless it's like, if you're not down here for the fucking meeting at 5:30... - [Paul] Exactly, but we need to have those conversations the night before. - And then we're eating and then I had to poop. - I told Paul on day two in the morning, I said just leave, go. You don't have to sit here and piss and moan about how we're not on time, just leave if you wanna leave. I was not happy. - So I kind of saw Paul's frustrations and stuff but in my eyes I was just like we need to set a time and stick to it as close as we can because these people, I know how hard it is to wrangle eight different guys better than anybody and it's just not something that happens no matter what you do. - When you get a bunch of guys together like us it's like five dogs in the same room, there's gonna be some barking going on. - Not having that kind of cadence or that kind of system or even knowledge of how each of us work together let alone how we're gonna survive together, none of that stuff had been gelled yet, none of that had been forged. It was the dumbest day of the entire trip because we were not happy and nothing was clicking I don't think how we envisioned it clicking. - [Justin] Next stop, Nashville. Peace. ("Moving Particles" by Sensations' Fix) (lyrics muffled) ♪ So I'll take my walk ♪ ♪ Mile after mile ♪ ♪ All I can see is the blue and the rain ♪ ♪ For the home team ♪ - So as we're going down Highland it opens up to this beautiful view of South Carolina and just the beautiful lush forest and curvy roads and we're full throttle going downhill. Exhilarating, this is day two and I'm like man, if this is how the whole ride is gonna be this is gonna be the most amazing thing. - Big Daddy pooped his pants. That's a highlight for me for sure of that day. (laughing) - Yeah, hey, I asked for a bathroom stop, man, it just didn't come. And then it did and I pooped my pants. - [Interviewer] Do you remember... - Did he take his pants off all the way for that? - Yeah, I left those babies. - [Interviewer] You already planned for it? - Bear in the woods, dude, throw those out. - Yeah, I'm surprised Big Daddy didn't poop his pants more. I think that he was prone to pooping his pants and I'm happy it happened so early on the trip. - This is when, could we just get all the lights off and get that silhouette and I'll just be like I shit myself. (laughing) - Everybody's excited because this is the day that we're finally gonna see some turns, some curves, some really exciting roads and the road as far as we were concerned, the one that we had been talking about since we saw where we were going. - Just growing up I heard about it riding motorcycles and stuff so I was pumped that I was finally gonna get to do it. - And it was the Tail of the Dragon. - Tail of the Dragon, yeah. - Tail of the Dragon. - We were supposed to be going on some road called Tail of the Dragon. - It was 318 turns in 11 miles. - 318 turns in 11 miles. - 318 turns in 11 miles. - It's 100 and something turns or something like that. - Doesn't really need an introduction outside of it's supposed to be America's greatest motorcycle road. ("This Is My World" by Esterly feat. Austin Jenckes) - Yeah, I feel like the Tail of the Dragon might have been the most over-hyped part of the whole trip. ♪ This is my world ♪ (engines revving) ♪ Oh, you took a wrong turn ♪ ♪ Now you're stuck in my world ♪ ♪ Trust me, this is gonna hurt ♪ ♪ Fire it up, and watch it burn ♪ Everything's so snappy and that's the kind of riding I really like to do. - I get it, it's cool but like... - Kind of like in Jurassic Park, it's super forested, you have these sweeping turns. - [Man] I'm riding by and if you look at me I'm all tense and intent and I'm completely focused on the road and what I'm doing. - I was loving it and I made sure I hung back further than everybody so I just had a ton of room to just really rip through there and push it, take it to the limit. ♪ This is my world ♪ ♪ Oh, you took a wrong turn ♪ ♪ Now you're stuck in my world ♪ ♪ Trust me, this is gonna hurt ♪ ♪ Fire it up, and watch it burn ♪ ♪ This is my world ♪ - Oh my God!

("Hometeam" by Chris King & The Gutterballs) ♪ Ain't no cheating way ♪ ♪ The home team ♪ - It turns out that on the Tail we had to have passed this person a minute, two minutes maybe before. Somebody went off the road on a bike and it was a man and his daughter and it was an accident, like a really, really bad accident. - It's one of those things that happen. What we do is dangerous. We do everything we can to mitigate the danger, you can protect as much against, but if it's your turn, that's it. - That was a super humbling, grounding moment where it was, this is fun, we're having a lot of fun but this could end in a heartbeat for one of us. - Dane radio's us and is like dudes, there's a storm, a heavy storm coming. - I felt like I got hit with a paintball. Like a raindrop just hit my arm and we were at a stop sign. We're doing 40, this is gonna leave welts or something, this is gonna suck. - Everybody on the intercom system, and I was leading 'cause I had the maps, everybody's like just go man, we're just gonna ride through it. We're already delayed, let's just ride through it, let's go, let's go. Something felt different, it was like nope, this doesn't look, the rain cloud is coming at us way too fast. You can actually see the curtain of rain in front of us and I saw a barn right off the road. We hadn't seen anything for like four hours before that. Immediately pulled off and it was like somebody just started dumping buckets of water. (rain pouring) - We got out of that literally seconds before that hit. - Look how blistered and sunburned I am and look what's going on behind me, the drastic weather changes in a matter of hours. - We all decide that this rainstorm is the perfect time for me to do my challenge which is the bikini scooter wash. ("Sexy" by Bensound) So I don't know if you're familiar with a women's bikini. If you're a woman then you're familiar with it but if you're a man you've probably never put one on. You don't understand that the front is really, really narrow so in order for me to be able to keep everything contained I had to wear the bikini bottom backwards. I wheel out Elliot's scooter into the rain, torrential downpour and I forgot I didn't have any washing materials, no soap, no brushes, nothing. So I used the best thing I had, my genitals. (laughing) - We're supposed to be on the road a long fucking time ago and I don't understand how people, I don't know what they're doing, I honestly don't. It's super frustrating. - We got a way late start that morning. I was pretty frustrated but I think that just how certain days came together you couldn't really control getting mad at it that day. - Anybody else want a spot of coffee before I throw it out? - So Ron's bike... - My bike is a lot like me. It's big, it's dumb and it tries too hard to be cool. It's not very nimble, it's not very agile. - Not safe, not safe at all. - It's a 2005 Honda Reflex that's lived in Florida most of its life. You can imagine what the condition of those bolts were like. - The skeleton he had put together for this thing the day we left was these pegs that went through the midrail of the bike where the front tire is so every time he hit a bump the front tire would hit the peg. - Big Daddy and Ron and stuff dealt with Ron's bike. What a disaster. - I'm just sitting there having to hacksaw this friggin' foot peg off. - Cut a giant section out of my homemade highway bars which would've eventually killed me. - Hey Ron, you should take a knife to your tire. (laughing) - We had taken a really good look at my bike and decided the back tire had to be changed and there was no way I could keep going on with it. - Because he was on a bigger bike and could catch up to us, I'm gonna hold back and wait for a shop to open and get this tire swapped and I'll catch up with you guys. - And here it was, two days into it, so many blood, sweat and tears already, it was tough, it was really tough. - It's gonna work out, man. - [Man] Be safe - I will. - [Man] Drive safe, man. - We rode away thinking Ron's going back. He's gonna maybe swap his tire and go back to Florida, he's close enough that he's gonna go back. - [Man] Drive safe! - Man, I really hope that we reconnect. I hope the splintering off doesn't turn into something that we can't control. Like somebody's going home. It was a weird feeling but I kept feeling whenever we separated somebody, there was a good chance they might not come back into the fold. - Big Daddy had a spider bite and he wanted to go see his doctor in Nashville. - I wanted to get it checked out before we went any further just in case something was going on. My side was swelling up and getting all crazy. (engine revving) No, dude, I don't know, they just said it was a bug bite and they gave me some meds and were like don't drink too much and I just kind of tossed 'em and was like that's not gonna happen. (laughing) (chattering) - It just ripped? - Oh yeah, blew the crotch out of 'em again, man. Look at this. Just opened it up. Woo, I am burning up, dude. There's no room in this seat for this stuff anymore. Yeah, I'm gonna live they just gave me some antibiotics and stuff, I got my ear cleaned out, that was crazy. There was like a Skittle in there. (laughing) She said I probably should go back to the doctor in like three days but oh well. - Pulled up to this gas station, we knew we had this stretch. Dane, this poor driver is telling us, guys, there's some serious weather coming in. - [Man] Where are we? - This is us right here then. (mumbling) (chattering) - And we all have shields. Do you have a shield you can pull out of the van? So if we do get hail you're not getting paintballed and bleeding and spaced. It looks like it's gonna continue to get bad or get worse or just stay like it is for a long time. So we can stand around here and waste a bunch of time and still end up going through it or we can still be more than three hours behind or we can just put a shield on and try to endure it. - We were like let's just ride through it. - And there was gonna be nothing around. There was gonna be no gas station, there was gonna be no emergency options for us to pull over if it is as bad as we think it might be. - It doesn't seem like it's gonna be that bad but there's this one corner that we turned and all of a sudden the sky is just black and at that point we knew it was too late to turn back so we just went for it. - I just remember coming up a hill and just seeing lightning in the way distance and hearing the thunder and the wind and you see the trees flapping. It was the craziest riding experience I've ever been in weather wise for sure. - Crap was in the road, giant puddles or whatever, and we're just being blown all over the place by the wind. (upbeat music) - I know it's pretty dangerous, we're cruising, we're still full blast and I see these little, you guys remember those little bumps in the road? - There were turtles on the road, big turtles. Where the fuck did the turtles come from? We're talking like turtles! And why are they in the road and where did they come from? - There's just turtles in the road and we're like dodging turtles and you're dodging sticks, you're dodging little creeks of water, it was crazy. - Through a bunch of turtles, it wasn't like a turtle, there were many turtles. - It was very, very wet for a very long time. - [Man] Keep twisting. (laughing) Keep going. (chattering) - [Man] Elliot's are bad. - [Man] Like a thousand year old egg. - [Man] I got like little raisins here. - Dude, there's water in the shoe. - And somebody remembered, it was like Paul, how is your Tamagotchi pet? 'Cause Paul's challenge was he had to keep one of those little pocket pets alive for the duration of the trip. - It's waterproof ability, not great. I opened my pocket and it was no longer alive. It was like well, somebody's getting their head shaved tonight. - It's dead. - I'm not happy about this. - He was so excited because he thought it was going to be so easy. - I really hope I'm not the only one to lose my challenge. - This makes me very scared for my own challenge. - Yeah, I'm shaving a cul de sac, I can hide it with a hat. At least I look like a normal person in a cul de sac with a hat on. This is not cool. Hey, here's the funny thing is that I never knew how to work it and it has been not alive this entire time. There's like a screen before you start the animal that just has a bunny and then you get to choose a different animal and I keep showing people the bunny and then every gas stop bringing it out. - And that's when we basically learned that Paul's a liar and he had been cheating. Never really showed us that the Tamagotchi was ever alive and just basically told us the instructions were in Chinese and I never could read them so I never turned it on so it's never actually been alive. - The buttons don't even make sense. - Just because he lied to us for three days I feel like something else should happen to him. (soft music) - Made it back to the hotel, first thing I saw when I looked up was two male butts pressed against the window. (laughing) So at least my friends were waiting for me. Went inside, drank a bunch of whiskey, Paul got his head shaved. - I got to shave him a cul de sac in his head. It's probably the most amazing feeling ever is shaving the part of somebody's head that is supposed to have all the hair. - [Man] I really want a sexy tuft though. - [Man] Oh my God. - [Man] Go deeper in the back, guys. You need to go deeper. - The deal is cul de sac, it's not cul de sac and tuft. (laughing) Get rid of that fucking tuft. - [Man] The tuft makes it. - [Man] I was into it and then I saw it. - [Man] I need to get one side right here. - It's fucking uneven. You went way more on this side than you did that side. - [Interviewer] Tell us a little bit about how you're feeling about the challenge. - How am I supposed to feel, dude? My friends are idiots and they did this to me. I have to embrace it. I'm not okay with it yet, I just have to be. What are my options, dude, what are my actual options? Look at me, what are my options? Look at me, dude. Look at my head. What are my options? This is me, dude, now. This is awful, dude. But I'm gonna live with it. ("The Death of Mr. Jones" by The Dames) - Jackson, Missouri to Nevada, Missouri. Not Nevada, Nevada, Missouri. - We went to Nevada. - Joe had to wear a ghillie suit for the whole day. 320 something miles of this snow camo sheep dog ghillie suit which is a sniper suit for anybody that doesn't know what a ghillie suit is. He looked so dumb. - The ghillie suit really wasn't my best day. - And it was a constant funny, like, whenever I was feeling down about anything I looked at my mirror and see Joe blasting this ghillie suit back and he looked so ridiculous. - Joe is in his ghillie suit and he looks ridiculous and all of a sudden he comes over the comms, guys, my bike broke down. - Probably my belt, just like dead. - [Man] Oh okay. - Yeah, you didn't see smoke, did you? - [Man] No. - And it turns out by the time we get there he's already got his whole bike taken apart and he's sitting there and can't figure out what's wrong with it. - I had all the stuff laid out. Was checking my belt, checking my transition, and nothing was wrong. So Barnes and I push him up this hill with our feet on the back of his scooter on his muffler and then he coasts down into the gas station, puts gas in, problem solved. - And lo and behold, much to my embarrassment I found out that I basically just ran out of gas. ♪ All right ♪ - We took a long, long grind across a really flat state. It was just get the miles in, get the miles in, get the miles in. - Big Daddy's challenge was to stop at every McDonald's that we passed, if we could see it he had to stop at it. - I was not looking forward to this at all. I kept trying to get out of it before we left. - Fuck all you guys. - [Man] Even when we thought of this we thought it was gonna be a funny thing but we're already so annoyed by how many stops we've been having to make unplanned that this just gonna take so long. (upbeat music) - So we're somewhere in Missouri or I have no idea what state we were actually in and we were all drafting and doing some Blue Angels type stuff. And I'm standing up on my bike with my fly open so I can cool off, it was so terribly hot. - We're going along and I was talking to my girlfriend Melissa on the phone. - I have no idea what happened but I heard a loud bang and I saw sparks right next to me and oh my God. - Suddenly, my back tire stopped. - I see blue smoke, boom, the bike explodes in front of me. It just ducks, twists and then Paul goes flying off the road. - The first thing I thought about was don't touch my brakes, that was first, definitely don't touch my brakes and I don't wanna go down and take my buddies out. I just aimed for the soft grass knowing I was gonna go down. - At any moment now you're just waiting for the end over end over end and Paul like Supermanning off into the distance. - And luckily my clutch actually exploded and the tire broke free when I was in the grass and I was able to ride it out. - [Man] And everybody on the comms are going nuts! They're like, he's riding it out, he's riding it out, oh my God, I can't believe he's riding it out! - As soon as I turn around I just drop my bike and run over to Paul and hug him because I can't believe that dude is still alive and up and walking and like holy shit, that was insane. - Did the belt just jam? - Yikes. - Holy, that scared me to freaking death. - I was on the phone. (laughing) - [Man] Who were you on the phone with? - With my girlfriend. - [Man] Oh no! - [Man] Call her quick. - [Man] Hold on a second, I'm gonna die. - Yeah, I was like I have to go. She's going, "what's happening, what's happening, "what's happening?" I'm like I gotta go. Everything just fucking rocked. - [Man] I thought you were down, man. - [Man] I thought you blew a tire. - I thought you blew a tire too. - I thought I did too. (tool drilling) - [Man] Did you say you saw fluid? - [Man] There's fluid dripping. - And as the cover comes off it's just a mess. - That middle one's out already. That's not good. Oh, torque diverter, look at that. - It's spaghetti and shards of metal everywhere. - [Man] Shit man. How does that even happen? - [Man] It's too hot. - Look at this, this is the thing the belt sits in and I've never seen anything like this before. This is insane. - This whole thing's destroyed. - Yup. - What happened is a bolt came loose and it caught right there, you can see that, and it just locked it up. So this is what spins with the rear tire and that's what caused that breakdown and this is essentially what ended the ride for that bike. - It broke the casting. - [Man] Yeah. - And that seal, you cannot put that back into a bike. - No. - Thankfully we had another one on our support vehicle that we were able to swap a few parts and get Paul going again. - Let's get it off, let's strip down the parts that it needs off of this bike and get that bike running so we can at least... - It needs three arm bolts, it needs the header bolt. - [Man] Let's pull it off. - By the time we got to this accident we already cannibalized a lot of this bike that was supposed to be a backup bike and now we're taking basically its legs. The whole transmission is gonna go, the clutch and everything has to go into the bike that Paul was using for the ride. - God damn it. (grunting) Fucking ranked that thing. (tools buzzing) - One thing that was pretty important to me was how everybody reacted. It was very, very heartwarming to have people that care about you so much and I think that I'd do the same for anybody. But it was definitely, I felt like my brothers were there for me then. - [Man] Big Daddy. - He could not have planned this day any better if he wanted to. We saw like three McDonald's. - And then four hours go by we didn't pass a single God damn McDonald's. - Come on, 350 miles, 12 hours on the road and the man passed four McDonald's, are you kidding me? - Alright, double cheese, here we go. - [Man] Double cheese? - Well yeah. - [Man] You got more than you needed to. - I'm just hungry, guys. This is the first McDonald's we've seen since we left. I didn't eat lunch 'cause I thought I was just gonna be pounding freaking burgers. I hate McDonald's so much. These things are just terrible. I mean they're go-to's. But they're still shitty. I actually feel pretty lucky right now. This is only the second one I've had to do so I might be coming out ahead on this one, boys. - We roll into Lincoln, right as we came into town there's McDonald's, so me and Ron stop, I grab a burger. We kind of came in one side of town, our hotel's on the other, then we waited for him at the McDonald's that was across the street from our hotel hoping he was gonna pass it so he'd fail his challenge and we could shave his head. - [Man] Uh oh. - [Man] Uh oh! (shouting) - When I realized he was at McDonald's Big Daddy just, you just saw him die just a little bit on the inside. (laughing) - Might as well end it on a high note, boys. God dang Happy Meal done. So I pulled in, grabbed a Happy Meal and ended where at least I got a toy at the end. Should've got that extra pickle, man. - And we were thinking about our challenges and this was my favorite point of the challenges because Elliot goes wait, when am I supposed to do my challenge? - My challenge was to hug 100 people in a day which sounded kind of daunting but I was like I can do it, you hit a Walmart, you hit a bar, you hit whatever. I wasn't that worried about it but I thought my challenge was on day eight. For some reason. - All of us kind of looked at each other like your challenge is day three, man, you didn't do it. Looks like we're shaving another head tonight. (clippers buzzing) - [Man] No! - [Man] There he goes! - No. - [Man] Oh my God, looking good. - [Man] Oh my goodness. - This is the most satisfying thing I've fucking ever done in my entire life. - Paul, let me see your do in this too. No, Paul, Paul, I'm trusting you, dude. You know where the part's at. I'm trusting you, dude. It's so painful seeing all of you watch. - [Man] Let's see the back! - [Man] Unbelievable. - [Man] Do a little twist. (laughing) - [Man] That is a solid line! - [Man] Lined him up real good there, dude! (chattering) - Oh yeah, dude. It's not bad. (upbeat music) - After day two I was like Elliot's definitely the airhead. - All this work that Elliot did before the ride, he didn't tighten down a single God damn bolt. - Again, like I really don't work on my scooter that much and we're going into this ride, I was like oh yeah, I gotta do a couple things. All the other guys are busy, I can figure it out. - He just put thing in there and hand tightened it together. - I think I lost four or five bolts from my bike. - Forgetting to bolt his bike back together, that was just genius. - He was like dudes, dudes, my bike sounds loud. And I'm right next to him and I look over and I can see his O2 sensor has popped out. Unfortunately we actually had to stop and fix Elliot's scooter again. - We're ripping along, all of a sudden my bike dies and I'm oh great, probably blew a belt. Derek is pretty good at ripping things apart, comes over with the impact driver and it's off, take it apart, he's like no dude, your belt's fine. - What happened? - I think it's the final drive, dude. - [Man] What? - I guess we're not making that two o'clock lunch. - Well we either gotta Frankenstein two bikes together. If we can't do that then we have to figure out a way to trailer it 'cause we only have room for one bike over there, so we gotta figure it out. (engine starting) - [Man] What happened? - No idea. I think he hit the kill switch. - When he stops and everybody stops we start it up and we try it first before we start ripping things apart. - Get on it, ride it, it's all good. Look down and like guys, I have something to admit. I hit my kill switch. (laughing) Maybe it was the kill switch. - [Man] Next time this happens and you pull off, try to start it. - Ah, damn it. I already felt bad enough about my bolts rattling out, I'm flying off and now. They never let me live that shit down, never. (adventurous music) (chattering) - [Man] They want us to stop right here. Slow down guys, on the right. Oh perfect. - [Man] Oh fuck, look to the right. - [Man] Whoa! - [Man] Damn! - [Man] Holy shit. - [Man] Come on. - [Man] Shit! - [Man] Dude, whoa! - [Man] This is the Badlands, boys. - [Man] Whoa! - Look over and it's just like, boom. Like this crazy, crazy landscape. (wind blowing) - It was almost overwhelming though. How many amazing panoramic vistas can you see of the American west? What was nice was seeing things that our country is known for like monuments and cool, exciting things because we didn't see shit for two days straight and then we saw things that had elevation and things that had some kind of uniqueness to them. - Should I stop this car and ask? - [Man] What? - [Man] If it's dirt all the way to the next town. - I had found a shortcut. I was like let's go this way. Or not a shortcut, but I found a back road. And me and Barnes looked at it at our first gas stop, we decided yeah, that's the way we're gonna go, so we punched in the GPS and once we hit the point of no return we just see the road turns to dirt and gravel and everything and we see a sign and it's like dirt road, 27 miles. - [Paul] When should we head out? - [Joe] Yeah, I like surprises, right? - [Paul] Alright guys, time to make moves. - And it was awesome. (upbeat music) - [Justin] We're stupid, boys. - [Paul] Yes we are. (lyrics muffled) (engines revving) (horn honking) - The whole day was great leading up to it, saw Badlands, saw Black Hills, saw Mount Rushmore and then we just hit this point where we got like 70 miles of just straight highway. - It was actually kind of terrifying. I think that was the part of that day that we knew we had a ton of riding to do still and we just had to bite the bullet and do it. - We're literally getting our faces sandblasted. (slow music) ♪ Oh, I think I need you ♪ ♪ Here in my darkest night ♪ - [Man] We may have to look at Daddy's bike. - [Man] I guarantee we need to look at his bike. - Yeah, that was bad for me, dude. But I was going like 10 miles an hour under everybody so I'm gonna draft the van and it was just no good. - For some reason Big Daddy and I seem to have the slow bikes. - That was kind of the point where my bike, I felt like was starting to tell me she's getting a little tired. I couldn't figure it out, didn't know what it was. Eventually pulled over. (tools drilling) - [Man] Blown, boys. - We got it back up and it started running a little bit better but I've had it for four years and put 20,000 miles on it and she's starting to feel it. - We changed two belts that day. - It was established that Barnes and I were going to be the mechanics on this trip because everybody else couldn't tighten their bolts, they put too much oil in, they were inept with the mechanics of it. - It's testy. (mumbling) - Technically that's three for me. One on the other bike and one when I had my mishap and this. (mumbling) - So I kept thinking that my bike's running crappy and it's gonna blow up at any given moment and we had a couple of near misses with some other people like a belt here and a belt there and I'm like God, this bike is probably gonna die. I also had this sketchy mechanic do the work in Florida so I'm like at any moment now this thing's just gonna go belly up on me. - [Man] Joe's engine light just popped on. - [Man] Who's? - [Man] Joe's. - [Man] His what? - [Man] His engine light popped on. (laughing) - Hey yours actually came off. I've never blown a belt like that. ♪ Won't you tell me your name ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'm feeling so far away ♪ ♪ And it's time ♪ ♪ Oh it's time ♪ - [Elliot] Wa, guys, hold on. - [Man] What? - [Elliot] I just died and I didn't hit the kill switch. - [Man] Are you sure? - And again, my bike just dies. - [Man] At least we found a spot to break down in. - [Man] Yeah, I'll walk it up there, don't worry about it. - [Man] I'll push you, I'll push you. - We're just ripping down this dirt road for like two hours, I don't even know how long it was but I guess at some point my battery terminal had come loose. (mumbling) (laughing) - [Man] Dag gone! - Loose terminal, baby! - It's sometimes the most obvious thing. (upbeat rock music) - [Man] Oh dude! Oh shit! (laughing) (screaming) (chattering) - The whole day it was up, up, up, down, down, down, up, up, up, down, was that the Cascades we were going through? - [Man] No, no, no, that was Sawtooth. - But to be there in that time, in that place, with these people and have something like that put on display for no reason, it just doesn't make sense. - At some point during the pre-process Justin was like hey, do you wanna be part of these challenges that we're doing? And I'm thinking like, I don't have a whole perspective of the fact that I'm so outside of this group but I was like well yeah, I'm gonna be there, I might as well do one of these challenges. - And the next day was Jesse's challenge and it was First Blood. Jesse had to live as Rambo for an entire day. He had to talk in only Rambo lines, he had to dress as Rambo, he had to live as Rambo. - Two people already got their heads shaved in the worst way and so I'm thinking oh no, these guys aren't messing around. - See Rambo? (laughing) (drumming) - I don't even know if the sun was up but I'm working on my bike, I look over and there's John Rambo staring at me. - A 300 plus ride today so probably about 10 to 12 hours of him acting like John Rambo which Jesse vowed last night when he was drinking that he was gonna beat this challenge by just not talking all day. He's a kid so he probably has no idea what John Rambo's character is or has ever even seen First Blood or any of the movies. So it's gonna be interesting. He's gonna be really quiet or he's gonna have a cul de sac or a missing eyebrow by the end of the night. - Well he's quietly honoring his options over there as John Rambo. I think he'll crack. I think we'll have another half shaved head. (laughing) - Rambo didn't say a word to anyone. He was Rambo. - Mute, 'cause he doesn't wanna break character. And that was damn funny. - He's already full John Rambo, method acting. He's not responding to anybody. The only acknowledgements he's giving us is grunt. I'm really excited. We're gonna try so hard to get him off of that. - [Man] He's gonna hate everyone by the end of the day. - I think rubbed real dirt on himself. He didn't have makeup. - [Man] It's grease from somebody's bike. - It's grease? - [Man] Yeah. - Oh, that's even better. - Everybody was just like you're gonna get your head shaved. We're gonna get you. You gotta pick an eyebrow or you gotta get a cul de sac. Neither of which I wanted. - But every once in a while, Rambo would come over the comm systems and be like, "he's dead, you're all dead." - Halfway through the day I would go to Dane and be like, "I got you, gimme the gun." And then I'd get the gun and sneak up on everybody and shoot 'em. - He had this gun that he was carrying and we were climbing another mountain pass somewhere and his scooter was new and kind of faster than ours so he would pull up next to us with his Nerf gun and shoot us all. So I remember being shot in the face at 50 miles an hour with a dart like what are we doing? - [Man] He's John Rambo. - I'm John Rambo. - [Man] He's done! (laughing) - [Big Daddy] I'm impressed, I thought I was taking an eyebrow. - It was terrible but he owned it. It was a funny challenge, I kind of wish it would've been mine. - [Tanner] Was that the loneliest ride today? (chattering) - [Man] The challenge said all day, man. - Man. - At this point we all smelled awful. I hadn't bathed in two or three days. I ran out of socks like states ago. - We were a ragged crew at some point, dude. Everyone's just super haggard. Two of us, just half our heads buzzed, we looked gnarly. - It was just, it had been a long trip. We didn't sleep a lot the whole entire trip. Pretty exhausted. We probably didn't get more than five hours of sleep a night. So it's wearing on us. And we didn't eat well. - Gas station corn dogs for lunch. - [Man] I wanna get a box of mini corn dogs and just cook 'em on my engine. (laughing) - Who doesn't buy corn dogs at the gas stations? You have two options, you have biscuits and gravy or waffles. - They all had the most terrible biscuits and gravy and for some reason it took until like day four for us to realize that this is not a good idea. - Breakfast biscuit? (chattering) (chewing) - [Man] These dudes ordered everything with pineapple on it. - We got some bread sticks for you. - I hate with every fiber of my being pineapple on pizza. - Pineapple on everything. (laughing) - I think I had steak every day. We were in the heart of cow country the whole freaking vacation. I go in, order the T-bone, and it was just shit. - [Man] That A-1 serves one purpose, shots. - A-1, I love that stuff. - [Man] Drinking A-1 is way better than putting it on a steak. Try it sometime. You have to. - It was just shitty steak, dude. It was like four year old cow or something, I don't know. - I'm not gonna eat anything but kale for a month when I get home. - I'm from Montana so I was really excited to see my home state, now I felt like I was done, I felt like I was already home. There's a bar there that threw us this party when we got there and raising money for the Morgan Foundation and the bar was attached to an MMA gym which was like the most Montana thing ever. - [Man] If you wanna jump in let me know. - That's a maybe. - [Man] That's a definitely yes, dude. It's a matter of who is jumping in. - I want a cul de sac versus cul de sac. - And all the dudes were like hey, you're fighting Paul. Cul de sac against cul de sac, this is happening. - [Paul] Elliot, cul de sac versus cul de sac? He said if you guys wanna jump in the ring just let me know. (chattering) - I haven't been in a fight before. It was like alright guys, had a shot and a beer and it was like might as well go for it. - And we both agreed that we were not gonna hurt each other. - We're not actually gonna fight each other, are we? And he was like no, no, let's just give 'em a good show. (bell ringing) - Ladies and gentlemen this fight is scheduled for 12 uncontested rounds. The winner will keep an eyebrow, the loser. (bell ringing) - Punching only. Fight. (cheering) - [Man] Elliot can't see him. (intense music) - Man, I'll be the first to admit when the gloves are on and you're just sparring with another dude, it's hard to hold back. - [Man] Punch his lights out, man! (cheering) - You hit me really hard a few times. Rung my bell once, kind of knocked me back and it's just that moment where your pride takes over and it's like nope, this is not happening right now. - I think I might've actually got a couple of pretty good hits on him. (mumbling) - Both our corners back there, all the dudes are behind us. They're like dude, you're actually holding your own out there pretty good. I was like oh yeah? I was like maybe I could win this fight. - Don't go for the face, dude, you don't need pain, you need throw up. (bell ringing) - [Man] Welcome to Montana! (cheering) - Just popped him right in the nose. Just straight in the opening part and I could definitely tell that he just like, everything stopped. (bell ringing) - He got me good, he got me good. - You okay, you okay? (chattering) - [Man] He's bleeding, he's bleeding. - I looked down there's just like blood gushing out of my nose and I was like alright, first blood, this is time to end it. - [Man] Elliot, let me get a picture! (laughing) - You okay? - Yeah. - Shaved his head and then I beat him up. Woo! No, it had nothing to do with revenge, it had to do with I realized that we were actually fighting. - [Woman] You kicked his ass. - No, I didn't kick his ass, I hit him one good time really after he hit me a couple good times. - I heard that, I heard that. I fought well but it wasn't good enough. Paul clocked me a good one. I got a couple good hits in though. - [Man] Yeah, you did, you did. - I hit more than I expected. - [Man] Good, good. - But Paul... - [Man] He got a sneaky one in there. - [Woman] He kicked your ass! - He came to the, he kicked my ass. - At this point I had spent probably over 100 hours building maps, like our turn by turn maps for our GPS unit. None of this makes sense. - You had some good sleep though so at least you have your wits about you. - None of this makes sense. None of these intersections look the same or at least have the same information. And this day I didn't have one. I did not have our final day's route. - It became pretty clear pretty quickly that Barnes had no idea where we were going. - Do we need to continue to hammer in that Barnes didn't have the maps? - Barnes doesn't tell anybody, we just wake up, get on our scooters and go. (engines revving) - [Man] What are we doing? - [Man] I don't know. - [Man] Are we really having a party? (laughing) I think we're lost. - [Man] Yeah, go check what's up. - [Man] Tanner, what's going on? - [Man] It dead ends up there. No, we can't go that way? - [Big Daddy] No, that road doesn't look like it goes anywhere. - [Man] Daddy, what did they say to you about this road right here? - [Tanner] They said that it's kind of a cool road. It loops around and I don't think it necessarily goes anywhere. I didn't ask them for directions to Seattle. - [Big Daddy] We're probably dipping down into Richland and then going up on that highway. - [Paul] That road doesn't go anywhere, Daddy? - [Big Daddy] Doesn't look like it. We should've taken a right when we went straight back there. - [Man] Oh. - [Justin] My bad, guys. - And we get lost four, five, six times, it doesn't matter. It was probably closer to eight but who's counting, right? - Those are the kind of moments I feel like are actually the trip. It was a lot of stops and it was a lot of gassing up and it was a lot of these moments where we were confused and didn't really know what way to go. - We finally get our bearings right and we are on the road and we are coming up over this hill and there's this hill that drops down out of the city. - You couldn't even tell what it was. There was just like a black line along the side of the road. - We all look over and there's just a line of scooters sitting on the side of the road. - All of our dudes and other people from the city, other people that thought the story was cool and the ride was awesome and wanted to just be a part of it as much as they could and they rode all the way out there or trailered out there and rode the rest of the way home with us. - [Man] Fuck yes! (screaming) - [Man] Take my scooter, I'm gonna fucking pass out! - [Man] Yeah baby! Oh the pig is here! (cheering) - [Man] Holy shit! - [Man] Oh my God, oh my God. - [Man] Oh fuck yeah. - And it was such an awesome feeling, I think everyone kind of got pretty emotional at that point like we had done it. We were home, there's our peeps and we're getting ready to just celebrate. - All of us, I'm getting choked up thinking about it, all of us were like crying in our helmets. Immediately I just lost it. - [Man] Alright, should we hit her back up? (cheering) (uplifting music) - We were about 3500 miles into this 3700 mile ride and finally it hit me that we just crossed the country on a scooter at 40 miles an hour, insane. - We've made it so far on these little, tiny bikes. - I told everybody, I was like do not let any cars pass. We're going up this mountain slow as hell and we just split the road, I remember, all eight of us right in front, just made a wall and the 30 scooters behind us came in and did the same thing. Just wall of scoots, wall of scoots and behind us just miles of cars and it was such a conquering feeling to just stick it to all those fucking people. - [Man] Not that we have any reason to. - We didn't have any reason to but we just wanted to, man. (speakers muffled) - [Man] What about the smoke bombs and the fireworks? - [Big Daddy] Elliot, I need that flare! - [Man] I love how we're rolling up to a ferry terminal. - [Man] Explosives, the Coast Guard is gonna be there in five seconds. - And we just did the classic move of is this thing lit or not and as soon as I point it towards my face just like shoots past my head. And I'm just glad that my ride could've ended right there. - [Man] All these people have no idea what's going on. - [Man] No, came in hot like a bunch of assholes, it's so rad. - [Man] Can we go down this? - [Man] We just did. (chattering) - [Man] We're doing it, we're doing it. - [Man] This guy's like come on, man. (cheering) - We pulled in, it was like the Beatles getting off the plane in New York. Everybody just went absolutely bananas. (speaker voices muffled) - And the one guy who had more problems than any of us on the whole trip when it came to mechanical issues or anything, Elliot, didn't even get to the water and dumped his bike. (laughing) The last four feet was too much. - [Elliot] And I didn't care, I just got off the bike, just let it kind of slide. Guys, we did it. (inspiring music) - [Man] I feel like eight riders took it through the entire country together. It was pretty phenomenal. Whether it's a belt, somebody's oil is flying out of their bike for some reason or they ride off the road, everybody was sticking together. - Do I wanna go back and do it again? I'm not so sure, we'll see. It's a traumatic experience. It was fun, we had a great time, it was awesome but it was like 11 of the most miserable days of my life. - After 11 days seeing that coming to an end and knowing man, I gotta get up tomorrow and go back to the real world, it was a bummer and it was sad but it was happy. It was just a range of emotional feelings that night. - Obviously we did it because we're idiots and we thought it'd be cool to ride 3700 miles at 45 miles an hour. (cork popping) (cheering) (laughing) - For me this was much more than about the ride. At the end of the ride, I didn't know this going into it but at the end of the ride actually becoming a family was a much bigger part of it than actually the 3700 miles that we rode. - We left Fernandina Beach, Florida with 3700 miles before the finish line. Went through rain, went through fights, went through breakdowns, everything that nature had to offer was thrown at us. Had a ton of laughs. (cheering) (laughing) We arrived in Mukilteo, Washington as a real family. ("This Is My World" by Esterly feat.
