(atmospheric electronic music) (electronic swirling) (wind rustling) (birds chirping) (loon wailing) - [Beatrice] Where do I begin? The noted theater actor, John Barrymore, is quoted as saying, "Happiness often sneaks in through a door "you didn't know you left open." I say, madness is when you remember locking that door. (door alarm buzzing) (upbeat choral music) - [Nurse Marlowe] Group in ten minutes. Group in ten minutes. - It's hard for me to pinpoint the exact moment that got me here, but if I had to absolutely name a time, it would the French dip sandwich from Fiorillos. (dramatic chanting music) You know the kind of sandwich that once you've had it, it's hard to be content with anything else? There are few things in life that compare to a well-constructed sandwich. Its simplicity was the source of its genius. Crusted bread, perfectly roasted beef, paired with a salty au jus. It was just, oh, I don't have the words. So you'll understand it when I say that I just had to have one. I told the owners that I didn't have any money. They didn't seem to mind. (phone camera clicking) Later, my mother would say it wasn't the sandwich that was the issue, it was my timing. (upbeat choral music) (atmospheric orchestral music) Ros left today. Before she left, she said, "Beatrice, be happy." I don't think it's ever been happiness that I've felt here. More like a, um, quiet admiration for the consistency of it all. Just like the woman next door to me starts everyday screaming-- - Jimmy Stewart had no anus. Jimmy Stewart had no anus. Jimmy Stewart had no anus. Jimmy Steward had no anus. - 40 times, every morning. - Jimmy Stewart had no anus. (electronic pinging) (atmospheric orchestral music) Jimmy Stewart had no anus. (electronic pinging) - Or how Anne plays chess against herself everyday, and everyday, white wins. (chess piece clacking) And then there's the constant invasion of privacy. (toilet flushing) Lot of toilet water drownings lately? - You'd be surprised. (Beatrice sighing) (urine trickling) - How are the kids doing? - They're fine. Little Jim's in a play. It's about the Lord. - You still at night school? - Yep. (chuckling) - I had a lot of water. Stratford Home for Rest and Rehabilitation. (whimsical orchestral music) The service is bad. The food is, nevermind. And the girls, wait, let's take this one at a time. Viola. Viola and her brother used to sail ships together. (thunder rumbling) Her brother died in a horrible nautical accident, when an expected hurricane hit the Hamptons last year. (hurricane roaring) (atmospheric orchestral music) (wind howling) It was her idea to go out that day. (atmospheric orchestral music) Tonya is by far my favorite person on the ward. Although, she spends most of her time in some other world. She believes unicorns are hiding in the forests of Norway, and whenever someone slips on the overly-polished floors of our ward, she blames it on the gnomes who live in the light bulbs. (atmospheric orchestral music) - You set them free when you turn off the lights. - [Beatrice] And besides the whole, I believe in fairies thing, Tonya thinks she can fly. (dramatic orchestral music) (body thudding against floor) - I'm a fairy, no let me go. (grunting) No, let me go. (grunting) (atmospheric orchestral music) - "Attention to health "is life's greatest hindrance." That was Plato and this is Helen. She used to be happily married, but one day, out of the blue, her husband left, saying that he had never loved her, like he had spent their lives under a spell. Somewhere in the conversation, the word fat was used. (atmospheric orchestral music) And then there's Julie. What can I say about Julie? Julie's just Julie. The three older ladies, who do each other's fortunes everyday, even though every day is the same. - Ooh, tonight you will be blinded by passion. - Ah, boy. (Olga laughing) - Oh, I bet it was that laxative you took earlier. (Olga laughing) (Magda laughing) (Norma laughing) (Olga laughing) - And Ophelia. (atmospheric orchestral music) They found her face down in a river two months ago. She doesn't talk, and she hates water for obvious reasons. - [Nurse Debbie] Ophelia, it's time for a bath. (atmospheric orchestral music) - Mornings in the cafeteria. Where I get to play the fun game of, is anyone gonna talk to me? Good morning, Viola. You're looking very dapper today. - Thank you, Beatrice. - What you got there? - It's a new trap, look. So you pull the string like this, it pops open like that, and so I'm gonna put some food in there, and so when Gerald gets hungry, he's gonna go in like this, and it's gonna trap him. I just need to figure out what kind of food Gerald likes. You know, as bait. - Gerald is Tonya's latest gnome obsession. (electronic pinging) What you thinking? - Hash browns. What? - I thought gnomes liked sweet things? Don't they make cookies? - That's elves. - Gnomes make shoes. - That's elves, too. - Then what the hell do gnomes do? - Exactly. - Well, in any case, I don't think they like potatoes. - I hate potatoes. - Can I have your butter? Thanks. Can I have your butter? Can I have your butter? (atmospheric orchestral music) - The whole meal, Helen. - I don't want it. Pancakes, too. - What's up, bitches? - [Beatrice] Up, I almost forgot about Kate. Kate comes from a wealthy family, and her father was eager (atmospheric jazz music) to get her married, but there was one problem, Kate regarded anything with a penis to be the source of all evil. A guy came along, who claimed he could tame the "wild Kate." His words, not mine, and he did through starvation, sleep deprivation, and mental terrorism, and soon they were a happy couple, but it wasn't meant to last. (man spitting) (man laughing) (man screaming) (body thudding on street) (tires screeching) (body thudding against car) - Scoot. (groaning) - Can I have your butter? - No. - Look, look, Beatrice thought of using syrup. - Hey, you know what would work better for that? Soap and water. (laughing) (Olga slurping) (Magda moaning) (women laughing) - Yeah. (blowing kiss) - Something bugging you, Barry? - I can't deal with it anymore. The old ones won't leave me alone. (women slurping) (women kissing) They're masticating me. - I think you mean emasculating. - Yeah, one of them pinched my butt. (group laughing) - Hey, don't laugh at him. I'm sure he's a sexual force to be reckoned with. Hey, Barry, you lost weight recently? - What? Me? Yeah, I've been working out. Jogging, gettin' fit. I got a diet book. It focuses on complex carbs. Not the white ones. - Barry? - Those just turn into sugar. - I was joking. (chuckling) - Oh. Right. (chuckling) alright. - Barry, is there anymore butter? - Why? - My toast is dry. - Well, then why don't you put some butter on it? - There's not enough yet. - Look at it. (sighing) (Helen laughing) - Come on, Helen. That plate has to be clean. - I don't want it. I don't want it. - Girls, breakfast is over. - [Beatrice] So, Ros, you want me to be happy in here? Alright, I'll be happy. (dramatic orchestral music) - Wait. - Find. - No. (clock ticking) - I think you've done very well, Beatrice. - Thank you, Doctor, I've been trying really hard. - Yeah, you're engaging with the staff, and I think you've been expressing yourself very creatively. - Thank you. - I look forward to seeing what you've done by next week. - Next week? - Yes, at our next appointment. Is there something wrong? - No, um, I just thought with all this improvement, that maybe we could talk about me getting out of this place? - Beatrice, everything you've told me about is from today. - I know, my progress has been rapid and focused. Did you see my dream catcher? So, okay, that didn't work, (atmospheric orchestral music) um, I guess I don't get to tell you about part two. It was pretty exciting, though. Oh, well. (dice clattering) I guess you'll just have to live with that disappointment. (dice clattering) (door alarm buzzing) (dramatic orchestral music) - Greetings and salutations, ah. - [Beatrice] Nick and Will, they're from another ward. They come her a lot. Privilege of being good patients. - Sweets to the sweet, Nurse Debbie. Good afternoon. - Hello, Nick. - Oh. - [Nurse Debbie] Hello, William. - [Tonya] Ooh, ooh. - If she offered me a pansy, I wouldn't know what to say, pansies aren't the type of flower, that make me hope and pray. If she had some columbine twisted in her hair, I'd tell her I'd rather see her dead, then see her standing there. Okay. (dice clattering) If she offered me a daisy, I really must abstain, daisies never have the fun, that a gentleman entertains. But if she handed me a violet, so delicate and new, I'd sweep her in my arms, and tell her I knew you loved me, too. - That's a lily. - Is it really? - It is. - Shame, violet is such a better name for it. - Nick, Nick, don't you think we should be getting on with the show? Ah, we gotta be back by four. - Hello, William. - Hello, Tonya. - Hi. - All in good time, Master William. I am merely warming them up. - But. - Fine. - Okay, what should we do? - Would you like a flower? (William gasping) - No, ah, thank you, no. - Let us do something terrifying. - No, we're not allowed to. - Political? - No. - An abrasive Juvenalian satire? - No, but we probably shouldn't do that, anyway. - Point taken. Well, so lets do-- (dramatic orchestral music) - Little help here? (feet squeaking on floor) (Julie gasping) (Nick laughing) (feet squeaking on floor) - [Julie] Ooh, ooh. - Huh-huh. (feet squeaking on floor) (body thudding on floor) - Ooh, catch, catch. - [William] I got, I got, I got. - Oh, no. I got. - You okay? - No. - Huh-huh? (Barry grunting) (William chuckling) (dramatic orchestral music) - You should have done it naked. - Yeah. - Put that girl down. - You don't want me to do that. She's real slippery. - Butter. - Put here down. Come with me. I don't think I need to remind you gentlemen, that it's hands to yourself when you're on this ward. - My humblest apologies, good madam. I saw the alabaster form of this fine maiden, and mistook her for a unicorn, and like Orion, I was drawn to the hunt. - You're welcome. - Hey, good job, Barry. (sneakers squeaking on floor) (Kate gasping) (atmospheric orchestral music) - [Beatrice] Julie is always trying to get off the ward. Trying to get back to her boyfriend. He's in a band. It never really works out for her, but, um, one thing you can say for Julie, she never tries the same thing twice. (sheets rustling) - So you see, young ladies, we're all donuts. Sweet and delicious little donuts, and we all have something missing inside of us. Do you see that little hole? - Every time one the girls has an incident, they bring in this dude. - That's where your happiness goes. - The Donut Dude. - Do you know where your happiness is? Why, it's right here. It's Jesus. I've got a little song about donuts and Jesus. I think you're gonna like it. (acoustic guitar music) ♪ So when you're feeling kinda sad ♪ ♪ And really kind of glum ♪ ♪ Find the center of your donut ♪ ♪ So you can have some fun ♪ ♪ It could be anywhere you look ♪ ♪ In an nook, or behind your ear ♪ ♪ Just put Jesus in your heart ♪ ♪ And you'll shed a joyful tear ♪ ♪ Just put Jesus in your heart ♪ ♪ And you'll shed a joyful tear, ♪ Yes? - Are we gonna eat Jesus? - I'm not eating Jesus. - It's optional. (intercom beeping) - Beatrice, it's time for your appointment. (knocking on door) - Come in. (atmospheric orchestral music) (pen scraping on paper) Good afternoon, Beatrice. Please. (pen scraping on paper) How are you this Valentine's Day? - Fine. - And how have you been sleeping? - Fine. - Any weird dreams? Any sexual dreams? - Not really. Well. - Yes? - There is this one about a mustachioed man, who bursts into my room, and tells me-- - This man has a mustache? - Yes. - Handsome? - Very. - The frame of 1940's leading man? - That is oddly specific, but yes. But it makes me sad. - Why? - Because Clark Gable has been dead a very long time. - Well, I think I figured out the problem. (atmospheric orchestral music) That's you? (Beatrice laughing) See? It says crazy. - Thank you. - Beautiful crazy. Oh, my, Oh, my God. Oh, my God, so crazy good. - Nice to see you again, Benedick. Beatrice. - Hello. - Benedick, do you suppose I could get my seat back? - Oh, yeah, yeah, of course. - Hi. (lips smacking) - Hmm. - So, Doc, how's my crazy lady doing? (chuckling) - We don't use that word, Benedick. - Oh, no, we use off-beat and socially divergent. - Oh, that's nice. - Mm, isn't it, though? (Beatrice giggling) - Beatrice has been showing great improvement recently. - Oh, you should see my dream catcher. It's really great. - It is gonna take some time before we can really measure that progress. - She seems fine. - Oh, no, I'm going through an emotional crisis right now. - Like right now? - Wait. (squealing) There it is. - That's hot. - Thank you. (laughing) - While humor is an important part of the healing process, though I think it would be good for you two to-- - Come on, Doc. She's fine. I mean, she checked herself in here. I don't see-- (Dr. Hathaway mumbling) - Beatrice signed herself over to our care. She made it my decision to say when she's ready to go. - It's been six months. Six. You wanna be at home, right, Beatrice? We'll start writing again, you'll cook me dinners that make me fat, and then I'll drag you (Beatrice chuckling) on runs that you runs that you hate. - (chuckling) If you mean by runs, staying in bed 'til noon, then yes, I'm in. (chuckling) - John's having his Midwinter Romp, you don't wanna miss that, do you? (Beatrice gasping) (atmospheric orchestral music) - The John he's talking about is John Oldcastle, my cousin. He's the most inappropriate person I know, so of course he throws the best parties. - Look that's all very nice, Benedick, but it really doesn't matter how great the place is she's going to. It's about the coping mechanisms she needs to survive there. - Coping mechanism, activated. (Beatrice laughing) (Benedick laughing) (atmospheric orchestral music) - [Tonya] Even the sandwiches are hearts. - Not hungry? Hey, Barry, nice job intercepting Julie earlier, huh? - Oh, thanks. Yeah, I mean, William caught her. - Yeah, he's real fast. - Is she okay? - Oh, yeah. She was real slippery, though. We had to hose her off. Got her tied up, down. In a bed. Her bed. In clothes, just until she calmed down. - Mm, how gallant of you. - Happy Valentine's Day, Barry. - Oh, yeah, I forgot. These are from the hospital. Happy Valentine's Day. - No. - [Tonya] Helen, just eat your cupcake. They're delicious. - Lunch is over in 10 minutes, girls. I wanna see all of that gone. - But I ate all my lunch. - You have five minutes, Helen. - [Tonya] You can do it, Helen. - Come on, Helen. She's like 10. You cannot be afraid of a 10 year old. - I think she's older than 10, Beatrice. (head thudding against table) - [Kate] Oh, come on. - It really isn't fair. She did eat all of her lunch. - [Kate] You guys are idiots. - Hey. - Cry. - What? (Helen fake crying) - Nurse Marlowe? - What? (Helen fake crying) That's so much better. You just have a little bit more. It's just one more bite. - That's right, Helen. It's just one more bite. (Helen sighing) (dramatic orchestral music) - Oh, hold, hold up, stinky pants. Only people that take showers can sit on other people's beds, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon. - Ladies, thank you for coming. I think all of you can agree, that this place is pretty miserable. - Yeah. - So it's my thought that it is pretty darn impossible for us to get any better, if we're just miserable all the time. - Genius. - Look, it was Albert Einstein who said that, "Insanity is doing the same thing "over and over and over again, "and expecting different results." - Helen? - I don't remember Einstein being crazy. - [Beatrice] He wasn't. - Then why are we talking about him? - Well, I'm just-- - You know what, I think he actually might have been crazy. They say really smart people suffer from mental disorders all the time. - Well, I heard he was addicted to sex. - He married his cousin. - Gross. So he was crazy. Good point, Beatrice. - Excellent point, please continue. - Now, my point is that we do the same thing every day, so of course we're not getting any better. So, I made this list. Yes? - I can't see your list. - [Beatrice] It's really not important yet. - Is it a visual aid? - Yes, but I don't, I-- - I cannot see your visual aid. - That's just a list of our names. - I know. - Why are you listing our names? Maybe you should explain it first, before you show the visual aid. Makes more sense that way. - [Viola] I agree. - Thank you. So, my thought is, is that instead of doing the same thing everyday, maybe we can do something different. Maybe we can try to make this place just a little bit better. - Is that allowed? - I think we'd get in trouble. - Yes, Kate. - Are you a doctor now? - No, I am not talking about anything crazy. I think we can do small things, just little things that could-- - Mm. - Yes, Helen? - I'm not happy. - Huh? - I observed that my name's crossed off the list. - Yes, it is. We already did you. That's where I got this idea. - But I'm not happy. - We ate the cupcake for you, Helen. - Yeah, that didn't make me happy. - You seemed happy at the time. - No, that was relief. - [Beatrice] Oh, well that sucks. - Yeah, tell me about it. - Wait, are we gonna have to eat more cupcakes? - Oh. - Nope, nope, nope, no, hands down. No more hands. Get them down. Look, are you happy? - No. - No. - Would you like to be happy? - Yes. - Mm-hmm. - Will you allow me to help you be happy? - Okay. - Okay. - Yes. - Yes. - Yes. - Yes, yes, good. Okay, Helen we're starting with you. (atmospheric orchestral music) Helen, what would make you happy? - Can I raise my hand? - Yes. Yes, Helen. - I don't know. - Hmm. (knocking on door) - Group in five minutes, girls. - Hey, hey, hey, I got this. - What? - Go ahead, go ahead. - What do you mean, you have - Go in there. - this? - I'll walk right behind you. Let's go, let's go - What are you doing? - Getting Helen checked off your list. - Wait, how? Kate? (atmospheric orchestral music) - Good morning. (book clattering against door) Jimmy Stewart totally had an anus. (Kate gasping and laughing) (Lady B gasping) C'mon. (laughing) - I didn't feel it. (sighing) - Kate, Beatrice, how lovely for you to join us. Group does start at 1 p.m. sharp. (atmospheric orchestral music) Alright, let's start. Julie. Welcome to group. (dramatic percussive music) Alright, let's get started with the share and care. (atmospheric orchestral music) Yes, Julie? - I think someone's blocking my phone calls. - Your calls are not being blocked, Julie. - I think they are, and I'm just trying to go through the proper channels to get something done about it. - Well, Julie, Tonya gets her calls. Helen gets her calls. You're allowed to use the phone during any free time periods. Isn't that right? Yes, that is right. (dramatic percussive music) - Jimmy had no anus. Jimmy Stewart had no anus. - Let's move on to our personal goals for the afternoon. Tonya, you want to get us started? - I'm coming very close to finally catching that gnome, who's been making the light buzz. - There's no gnome, Tonya. - Yes, there is, his name's Gerald. He's a forest gnome, but his passion's in wiring. - This poor woman. - Kate. (atmospheric piano music) Viola? - Well, I don't know. - Well, I think it would be a good idea for you, to give up just one piece of your brother's clothing. Not to throw away, just something we can keep for you. Kate. (dramatic percussive music) - No anus. Jimmy Stewart had no anus. - What's your goal, Nurse Marlowe? - My goal? (atmospheric orchestral music) - Yeah, your goal. - Kate, I don't need a goal. - Jimmy Stewart had no anus. Jimmy Stewart had no anus. - Tonya, Beatrice? - [Lady B] Jimmy Stewart had no anus. Jimmy Stewart had no anus. - But if I did, it would be to give you girls the best care possible. - Jimmy Stewart had no anus. Jimmy Stewart had no anus. - Uh, I wanna write a letter to my love. - Jimmy Stewart had no anus. - That's very nice, Julie. - Jimmy Stewart had no anus. - And then I'm gonna write (Ophelia laughing) a strong worded letter to - Jimmy Steward had no anus. - whoever is blocking my phone calls. - Jimmy Stewart had no anus. - Ladies, face forward. (group mumbling) - Jimmy Stewart has no anus. - I want my phone calls. - Jimmy Stewart had no anus. - There's stealing in the kitchen. - Stop blocking my calls. - Jimmy Stewart had no anus. He had no anus. - I want my phone calls. - Jimmy Stewart had no anus. - La... - Jimmy Stewart had no anus. (group hollering) - Ladies. - Jimmy Stewart had no anus. - Wait, who had no anus? - Jimmy Stewart had no anus. - Jimmy Stewart. - This isn't really what I meant. (group yelling) - Helen, are you happy? - Jimmy Stewart had no anus. Jimmy Stewart had no anus. (group yelling) - You're welcome. Who's next? - Jimmy Stewart...(shrieking) Jimmy Stewart had no anus. Jimmy Stewart had no anus. (pillow thumping against body) (atmospheric acoustic guitar music) ♪ And sigh not so ♪ ♪ But let them go ♪ ♪ And be you blithe and bonny ♪ ♪ Converting all your sounds ♪ ♪ Of woe ♪ ♪ Woe ♪ ♪ Woe, oh ♪ - So what's your plan? - Apparently, I made things worse. - So what's your plan? - I don't know. What does Viola want? She wears men's clothing because she wants a-- - A penis. - Her brother back. - Or that. - But I can't do that for her. - Yeah, you'd have to reach like beyond the grave or something. - You girls are so cute. I remember when we were your age in here. (Norma snoring) - I think I was 21 years old, the first time I got locked up. - Things get easier as you get older. - Okay, so, um, what do you think? (Norma snoring) - What's in it for us? - You get to feel good about helping someone else out. (Norma laughing) (Norma snoring) - I want to watch Ellen. Everyday. When Ellen is on, I want the TV to be on Ellen. - [Magda] Oh, that's good, that is good. - [Chuckling] I like her dancing (Norma snoring) and her general zest for life. - And Castle, we want the TV then, too. - Yeah. - That Nathan Fillion has a nice butt. - (laughing) I wouldn't kick him out of bed - No. - for eating crackers. - Okay. So, can you do this? (Norma snoring) - Uh? - [Magda] Hmm? (Norma snoring) - Bring us (dramatic orchestral music) the confused one. (Norma snoring) (lightning cracking) (Norma snoring) (Magda sighing and hissing) - Uh, tonight, you will be blinded by passion. (Norma moaning) - Oh, that's my favorite card. - What does that have to do with my brother? (Norma snoring) - Your brother? - Beatrice said you had something to tell me about my brother? - Your brother. (Norma snoring) Yes, your younger brother. (atmospheric orchestral music) - No, older. - Ah, your older brother. Just a few years wide. - By five minutes. We were twins. - Your twin, (Norma snoring) Chuck. - Sebastian. - Are you sure? I'm getting a very strong Chuck vibe here. - He was my twin, I think I'd know his name. - The afterlife changes (Norma snoring) all of us in different ways. Some transcend (eerie orchestral music) to a higher form. (Norma snoring) Some just want to silent. (Norma snoring) for all of eternity. (Norma snoring) Her brother wants to be called (Norma snoring) Chuck. - Chuck. - Are you sure he doesn't want to be called, no more Ellen? - That's a really strange name. - Look, doesn't he have a message or something important to tell her? Something more pertinent or-- - It's okay. I didn't really wanna do this anyway. (Olga gasping) (ominous orchestral music) - Viola, Viola, can you hear me, Viola? - Yeah. - You must let me go, Viola. I love you, and I always will. Look into your heart, Viola. (Norma snoring) I will be there. Sail for me, gentle Viola. Sail for me. (Norma snoring) (Olga gasping) - Mm-hmm. - And one more thing. Stop wearing my shit. (Norma snoring) (dramatic orchestral music) (Magda, Olga, and Norma laughing) (Magda, Olga laughing) (Norma slurping and laughing) (dramatic orchestral music) (chess pieces clattering) (dramatic orchestral music) - She's still wearing her brother's clothes. - It's a process. - Who's next? - Tonya. - Me. (atmospheric jazz music) I wanna fly. - No. - Wait, I changed my mind, I wanna fly, too. - We already did you. - But I'm not happy. - You're smiling. - No one is flying, no one is flying. - Well, if I can't fly, I guess I'll never really be happy. (door alarm buzzing) (upbeat jazz drum music) - Good afternoon, my Nymphs and Maenads. - What are you doing today? (dramatic jazz drumming music) - Today, we shall have a play. - Where are the other actors? - We need no other actors. I am Thespis, bravely stepping out from the safety of the chorus. Plus, I have puppets. - Although, there is one scene that calls for three actors. - Ah, a hard feat even for me. I suppose I could use a little help. Lord Barry. Yes, will you assist me in this theatrical endeavor? The role I would ask of you is small, but pivotal to the plot. Lord Barry? Lord Barry? No? Well, alright. I suppose then, I shall require one of you ladies. Gentle mistress, do you mind? - No touching. - Very good. Now, for your part, you shall be playing the wall. - Oh, well she's perfect for that. (Olga and Magda laughing) - Now, all you have to do, is stand here with your arm outstretched, and make your hand like, very good. - What play is this? - Ah, a tragedy in three parts. - Sounds bleak. (chuckling) - Sounds like drama. (whimsical orchestral music) - The tragic tale of Pyramus and Thisbe. Enter, Pyramus. Tall, dark, handsome. - Almost too handsome to be believed, but I beg of you ladies, believe. (Kate yawning) - And observe the wall, the wall that stands between Pyramus and his one true love, Thisbe, the daughter of his enemy. - O, grim-look'd night. O night with hue so black. O night, whichever art when day is not. O night, O night, alack, alack, alack. I fear my Thisbe's promise is forgot. And you, thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall. Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eye. What see I? No Thisbe, do I see. O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss. Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me. These are just the lines. You are doing wonderfully. (whimsical orchestral music) Now will I to the chink, and spy and hear my Thisbe's face. Thisbe. My love art thou, my love, I think. Oh, kiss me through the hole of this vile wall. (lip squeaking) I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all. (Magda and Olga laughing) Let us have a round of applause, for what was the sweetest wall ever played on this stage. (group applauding) you can sit down. Thisbe arrives first at Ninny's tomb, but what she meets is not her sweet Pyramus. - Where is my love? Roar. (Nick screaming) (Kate and Tonyalaughing) What, thy mantle good, stain'd with blood. Out, sword and wound the pap of Pyramus. I, that left pap where heart doth hop. Thus, die I thus, thus, thus. (mimics blood spurting) (atmospheric acoustic guitar music) Now, am I dead? Now, am I fled? My soul is in the sky. Tongue, lose thy light. Moon, take thy flight. Now die, die, die, (body thudding against floor) die, die. (atmospheric acoustic rock music) - That's it? - [Nurse Marlowe] That's enough theater for one day. - These ladies demand to be entertained. - [Nurse Marlowe] The mail just came, you can hand it out. - Hand out the mail? - [Nurse Marlowe] Yes. - Rather than doing a play? - Yes. - Well, it does not seem as culturally enriching, but I shall make it worthwhile. - Good. - Ladies, en lieu of a gratifying theater experience, may I present to you the mail. (atmospheric orchestral music) One for Viola. Most assuredly, a mysterious letter of dark secrets, leading to a grand adventure. For Helen, a letter regaling of her beauty and poise. Uh-huh. One for, not one for Kate. One for, William, could you help with this one? - No, no, that's okay. - No really, I insist. - No, I don't really see-- - You're only making it more embarrassing for yourself. - I believe this one is for you. - Thank you, William. - You're welcome. - That was nice. And one for Julie. (dramatic orchestral music) - [Nurse Marlowe] No running. No running. I said, no running. - And it looks like we are done for today. (Ophelia clapping) Ah. And so my lady, I must bid you adieu. (dramatic orchestral music) Adieu. Adieu. A dieu. Adieu. (door alarm buzzing) Adieu. (dramatic orchestral music) (Julie crying) (knocking on door) - Julie, hello? (Julie crying) (knocking on door) - Hey? Let us in. (Julie blowing nose) What do you got there? - It's from my love. - Is that not a good thing? - It is. (shrieking) - Okay, then why are you crying? - Because he says he wants to visit me, but the hospital won't let him on the grounds. - Why? - Because he's considered a hindrance to my recovery. (shrieking) - Can I see the letter? - No. Ah, it contains private matters. - That was emotional. - You can help Julie first, Beatrice. She's a little bit more, you know, than I am. (atmospheric orchestral music) - No, we're doing you first. - Well, thank you, Beatrice. (atmospheric orchestral music) - [Lady B] Jimmy Stewart had no anus. - Come on, Gerald. Time to go back to the forest. - [Lady B] Has no anus. Jimmy Stewart had no anus. Jimmy Stewart had no anus. - Gerald's having a hard time coming to grips with reality. (knocking on door) - There is no anus. - Jimmy Stewart had no anus. - You have a visitor. - [Lady B] Jimmy Stewart had no anus. Jimmy Stewart had no anus. Jimmy Stewart had no anus. Jimmy Stewart had no anus. - What are you doing here? - Hey, watch it, lady. (atmospheric orchestral music) I come bearing gifts. - Oh? - How are you? - Fine. The food is still awful. - It can't be that bad. - They served us sandwiches yesterday. - [Benedick] But you love sandwiches. - They used Kraft Singles. - Oh, my God. (Beatrice chuckling) We need to get you out of here. This aggression will not stand. We demand Gouda, we require Gorgonzola. - Shh. - We will fight for Swiss. - Is there a problem here? - Yeah. Yes. - No touching. - Is is true you've been serving sandwiches with Kraft Singles? - Excuse me? - Have you been serving sub-par cheeses on these ladies' sandwiches? - Well, I'm sure there are some girls who would like to have different cheeses on their sandwiches, but we have to think about the ward as a whole. We choose something that can appeal to everyone. - Kraft Singles appeal to everyone? - In an unoffending way, yes. - Really? That's a genuine surprise. (Beatrice chuckling) Do you see it? She is a delight. - Shh, what's in the bag? - No, no, no, no. I know you were disappointed with your last appointment. So, if you can't go to the outside world, the outside world must come to you. A crossword puzzle to do bundled up on the couch. - Mm-hmm. - Your favorite mug for hot cocoa. Little cinnamon candies you like from the farmer's market, and something sexy for me. Some nuts to remember this place by. I'm really excited about this one. Look what I found. - Oh, my God, what is that? - It's your doll, I, I found her in the attic. - No, I've never seen this. Ever. - Are you serious? Then I must send her back to hell. - No, I'll take her. - Okay, Mr. Cheese, time's up. - [Benedick] Ah, no, no, no, no, this stuff's for her. - Oh, I know, and it will be in the locker waiting for her. She can use them when she gets to the common room. You can keep this. - Well, I tried. (chuckling) - Yeah. - You can either do a crossword, or hangout with little miss creeps-a-lot. - Bye. - Mm-mm. Mm-mm. - Marlowe, it's been magical. - No touching. (Benedick whistling) (Benedick hissing) (Beatrice chuckling) - Kate? What did you do? I think I figured out Tonya. - No one can figure out Tonya. - No running. - No, I meant that I, I have a plan. - I know what you meant. (atmospheric orchestral music) - I could use your help. Kate? (chair banging against floor) (Kate laughing) (Kate laughing) - (laughing) What did you need? (dramatic orchestral music) (candy clattering) - Ladies and other ladies. I am please to present... - Hey, mister, get on with the funny. - Nick? (light buzzing) - Gerald. (upbeat jazz drum music) (Beatrice laughing) - Hey, ah, girls, wait. - Come on. (papers fluttering) - Gerald? (upbeat jazz drum music) - Come on. - Okay. - Gerald? Oh, no. Gerald? I knew it. Gerald? (laughing) I knew it. (laughing) I knew it. (Helen crying) (upbeat humming music) - I am in control of my own reality. - [Group] I am in control of my own reality. - [Man From Record] I am in control of my own happiness. - [Group] I am in control of my own happiness. - [Man From Record] I am strong because I know my weaknesses. - [Group] I am strong because I know my weaknesses. - [Man From Record] I am beautiful because of my flaws. - [Group] I am beautiful because of my flaws. - [Man From Record] I am unique because of my quirks. (upbeat humming music) We are stronger together than apart. - Barry, you can't take him from me, you can't. Don't take him from me. - Look how happy everyone is. - [Viola] Don't take him (crying) - Barry, put them away. - from me. I hate you. (upbeat humming music) I hate you, I hate you. (upbeat acoustic guitar music) ♪ So put Jesus ♪ ♪ In your donut ♪ Do you know who's missing from your donut? - It's Jesus. - [Tonya] Is it Jesus? - Yes, it is. (upbeat acoustic guitar music) - Okay, ladies. (electronic dance music) Let's take this higher. We're gonna climb beanstalks. We're climbing all the way up to the sky. - Um, excuse me? Is this the Jack in the Beanstalk kinda beanstalk? - [Dennis] Oh, exactly. Oh, yes. Oh, come on, Julie. Like the rest of the girls. Last time I checked, Helen, you can't jump up a beanstalk. - I'm a jumping bean. - That's not an option. Very good, Tonya. Maybe you can help Julie out over there. - No, she's not a team player. - You figured out the weirdo yet? - No, but it needs to be bigger. Much bigger. - Alright, ladies. Now, (exhaling) we're gonna take it up higher. We're gonna reach up out of this ward, and we're gonna take it up to the sky. Reach it up, ladies. - Let's get outta here. - Alright. - No. - I hate this class. - No, with Julie. Off the ward, we will bring him here. We'll take her to him. - No, no. - Beatrice, Kate? Less talk, more stalk. (upbeat jazz music) (stapler clacking) (stapler clacking) - I'm having trouble. You know? - No, I don't know. - Number two. - Are you bowel movements difficult, or have they stopped completely? - That's very personal. - Beatrice? - Stopped. - I'll tell Dr. Hathaway. - Thank you. (upbeat jazz music) (Tonya and Beatrice whispering) - Hey, Barry, how are things going? Yeah, you. What have you been up to nowadays? - I'm doing good. - Anything new? What's going on? - Yeah. Yeah, I got this new tape. It teaches me new words. You know, trying to build up my pronunciation. - Vocabulary. - Exactly. - Well, how very pedestrian of you, Barry. - Well, that's very nice of you to say so, Kate. (group laughing) - I don't think so, no. - Oh, right. - Yeah. - That wasn't very nice. You didn't have to be mean. - I didn't? Well you should have been more specific. - Ah. (keys jangling) - [Helen] We're criminal masterminds. - Okay, well, that'll get us through the door, but how do you plan on getting pass the guard at the front? - Leave that to me. (upbeat jazz music) - Thank you. Julie. Thank you, Julie. Beatrice. - What is this? - That's a laxative. - Nurse Marlowe, you're a saint. Girls, let's raise our glasses to Nurse Marlowe. Patron saint of pooping. - Next. - Is four enough? - No, six. (hand banging shoe against floor) - Lights out in 10 minutes. - Somebody stole my goddamn shoes. Don't look at me like that, Barry. Somebody stole my shoes. Goddammit. - You know what, nobody stole your shoes. (Viola screaming) - Viola, stop it. - Are these them? - Can I help you? (Nurse Marlowe's stomach growling) (Nurse Marlowe sighing) (Nurse Marlowe's stomach growling) (bathroom door lock clacking) - [Beatrice] Tonya, get the door. (door buzzing) Okay, come on. Come on. - Where am I going? - We're taking Julia to her guy. - Oh, I'm not doing that. - But you stole the keys. - Oh, I just thought we were stealing keys. - Ophelia? (dramatic orchestral music) (Beatrice yelping) Nick. (dramatic orchestral music) - Master, Steve, are you a good man and true? - Huh? - Have you seen anything untoward this fine evening? Any shenanigans? - Come on, Nick, now you know you're not supposed to be out here. - Master Steve, you have a seeing eye, but I don't think any of us are supposed to be here, but then again, what is here, really? - Huh? - Exactly. (Nick laughing) - Come on, Nick. (groaning) (upbeat orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music) (keys jangling) (dramatic orchestral music) - Well, holy shit, we did it. - Yes. (chuckling) - It's cold. - Alright, Julie, where do we go? - [Julie] What? - [Kate] Come on, Julie, we're in the street, and it's the middle of the night, let's go. - [Tonya] Where does your fella live? - Oh. Um. I lied. Ah. This letter wasn't from him. - You lied? - I have trouble making sound judgment choices. (crying) (crying) It was the stress. - This is a letter from your mom. Yeah, it says your dog died. Are you serious? Really? (Julie crying) - He was a really good dog. (crying) - That's great, great, what now? (Julie sobbing) - I know. (upbeat country music) - And then after the party, and everyone had gone to bed, I heard something outside my window, but it was him, he was there all along. He waited there the whole time just to talk to me again. - The dog waited outside your window? - Oh, we're not talking about the dog anymore, dumb shit. - Okay, so let me get this straight. This guy crashes your party and meets you for the first time, then he gets kicked out of said party, and not only waits for the party to end, but waits for your whole family to go sleep, all the while staring through your bedroom window? - Creepers. - I'm sure I'm never gonna find love like that again. - How are old are you? - 18. - You sad little bastard. You have no idea. - I need to pee. - We need to pay. - I have some money. - Don't worry about that, I got it. - I only had tea. - How do you have it? - I only had tea. - Don't worry about it. - I only had tea. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. - How was everything? - Very good. - Good. - Don't I know you from somewhere? - I don't think so. - Richard, don't we know her from somewhere? - [Richard] What? - Don't we know her from somewhere? - Yeah, wedding dress. - Ah, that's it. - It's me. - Did you ever get married? - No, I, um, I decided to take some time for myself before taking the leap. - Good for you. Don't feel bad, with this guy, he almost bolted on our big day. Isn't that right, honey? - [Richard] What? - You almost bolted on our big day? - Yep. - I'm glad you're doing better. - Thank you. - Are, ah, these your friends? - Oh, we all work together down at the hospital. - Oh, nurses. I'll give ya a discount. - Nice, okay. - [Woman] $30.29. - Okay, I got it. - [Woman] Hope your friend's okay. - My friend? - Yeah, she's been in the bathroom awhile now. (upbeat rock music) - Do you see what I mean? This didn't mean anything to her. Julie, are you happy right now? - (chuckling) No. (atmospheric orchestral music) - Come on. Come on. - I escaped through that window. (atmospheric orchestral music) (keys jangling) - [Kate] Okay, go. (dramatic orchestral music) (Benedick humming) - Good morning. (laughing) What? - What? (Beatrice laughing) - You're not saying anything. (Benedick laughing) - Give me a sec. (laughing) - Okay. (laughing) Oh, come here. (chuckling) Come here. I have made you breakfast. (chuckling) Um, I wanted to make you a vegetable omelet, but you don't have eggs, you have tortillas and cheese. Um, that's fine. That's good, but I found this. So, there you go. I am sorry (Benedick chuckling) it's not more. It's been a second. - I'm aware. So they just let you go? - Mm-hmm. - Ah, without calling me? - It's the weekend. - Right, yeah. (Beatrice chuckling) How'd you get home? - I swam. No, I walked. I walked for about three hours, and it was just really nice. I just feel really good. If you want, just call the ward. Call them right now. There's no doctors there right now, but Nurse Marlowe is there, and, um, I just feel really good. I just, I just want you to be good with me. - So I guess you need a dress, right? (Beatrice sighing) (Beatrice chuckling) (Benedick chuckling) - [John] Yes, its a big stone house, on the-- - John? - Yes. (Beatrice yelping) Come hither. (groaning) Hey, how you doing, nice tie. - Ah, thank you, sir. - Nice bow tie, Ben. Alright, let's go. Come, come, come, come, come, come. I'll put your coats inside. - Jimmy Stewart had no anus. (group laughing) 40 times every morning. - [Man] (laughing) 40 times, yes. - Well, we're just so happy you could make it. - Well, Beatrice wouldn't miss one of my parties. Even if they'll just drag her back to the loony bin in the morning. - John? - Not, it's fine. It's just, um, we actually do prefer the term funny farm. - Nutso jail. - Whacky shack. (laughing) - And your timing couldn't have been better. You saved us from Portia's tale of the contested parking spot at the local grocer's market. - John? John? - Timing. - You know what I'm talking about, right, Benny? - Don't draw me into this John, I'm smarter than that. - [John] I hear you brother, I hear you. - Timing, oh, God, timing. Oh, my gosh, I don't think I told, oh, you haven't heard this one. Um, okay, um, alright, so, okay. So, it's the wedding day. Our, our wedding day, and, um, I am just sitting around waiting, and I have the dress on, and my hair's done and my makeup, and I'm ready. (laughing) So, um, ah, and I'm not quite sure why I was all alone, but I do remember that I had the worst craving for a French dip sandwich. (laughing) - Beatrice? - No, no, no, it's fine. It's fine, I'm almost done. Um, so I, I have the dress, and then I just go. (laughing) and it was only later when they actually found me, that I told them, I just wanted a sandwich. (laughing) Um. So, ah, so, ah, it was my, um, it was my mother who said that it wasn't the sandwich that was the issue, it was my, um, it was my timing. Uh, 'cause um, it was my wedding day. (man laughing) - Timing. (laughing) Classic. - Benedick. - Dr. Hathaway. Ah, everyone this is, this Dr. Hathaway. I hope you don't mind John, I took the liberty of-- - No, no, no problem, have a seat. - Hello, Beatrice. - Hello. - Well, this is nice, isn't it? Isn't this nice? - [Man] The nicest, huh-ho, big time. - [Beatrice] Have you ever been in a conversation, where the people you're talking to stop seeing you, and only see the crazy? - I need a drink. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. Okay, B, what's your poison? - Just water. - Oh, come on. Doc, back me up here, a little bit of the giggle juice never hurt anybody. - Actually, she's right. Not with the pills she's taking. - Oh, I'm sorry. - No, it's fine. - I shouldn't drink with the medication I'm on, either. - But she does anyway. (laughing) - [John] What kinda stuff they got you on? - Um, just the usual things. - Yeah, Valium, sleeping pills, Zoloft? I bet it's the Lithium. - John? - Or is that a thing that you prescribe off ward? - Yes, we do, but that wouldn't apply to Beatrice. She's not off the ward. Isn't that right, Beatrice? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Beatrice? Beatrice, stop. - [Beatrice] You called. - They called me. I mean, they do a head count. You lied to me. And it's disappointing. - You wanted me to come home, and so I came home. - Not like this, Beatrice. (Beatrice crying) (somber orchestral music) (door buzzing) - Jimmy Stewart had no anus. - Hello to you, too. - Fairy girl, she flew away. - Hi. - Hi. I tried to fly away again. - I can see that. - I don't think I'm ever gonna fly. And Gerald left. He didn't even say goodbye. How was your party? - (chuckling) Disappointing. Ah, so I came back. - Yeah, you did. William wrote me a poem to make me feel better. You wanna see? - I would love to see that. (Beatrice chuckling) (Beatrice laughing) (Tonya chuckling) (atmospheric choral music) I need a new plan. - Group in 10 minutes. Group in 10 minutes. - Viola, I'm sorry. - Why? - Well, um, I just, um, I wanted to make things better for you, and I just... - At least you tried. - [Anne] Mm-mm. (chess piece clattering) (atmospheric orchestral music) (phone ringing) - [Benedick On Voicemail] Hi, you've reached, Benedick. Make me happy. (voicemail beeping) - Hi, it's me. Um, I doing really well here. Ah, I hope you're doing really well, too. I, um,-- (voicemail beeping) miss you. (phone ringing) - [Benedict On Voicemail] Hi, you've reached Benedick. Make me happy. (voicemail beeping) (Lady B chuckling) (Lady B breathing heavily) (atmospheric orchestral music) (book clattering) (body thudding against floor) (Beatrice gasping) (atmospheric choral music) (book clattering down stairs) (group whispering) - Shh. - Shh. - What's all this? - It's your party. (atmospheric piano music) - Is she gonna sit down? This was a shit ton of work. - Helen? - I told you we used too many streamers. - No. This is perfect. - Well, sit down. - Yeah. - Yeah. (atmospheric orchestral music) (Beatrice laughing) (Beatrice laughing) - Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Yes. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Three cheers. - [Beatrice] Three cheers (laughing) (atmospheric orchestral music) Hey, Ophelia. How are you? (finger tapping on book) No, no, I'm not doing this anymore. - She wants you to do one more for Nick. He is leaving tomorrow. - Nick's leaving? - Clean bill of health. (chuckling) Or clean enough. - [Beatrice] I don't even know what I do for Nick. - Well, I think she has an idea for you. - I'm gonna go wait for them to get here. - [Viola] I'm going too. - Come on, Ophelia. What's wrong? You want your wipes. Really? (atmospheric orchestral music) (water flowing) Just a little bit of water, okay? Okay, come on. Come on. (ominous orchestral music) (water trickling) (Ophelia coughing) (Ophelia laughing) (Beatrice laughing) (Ophelia laughing) (Beatrice laughing) - What is going on here? Did you know about this? - I pray you, I have a mind to speak with the Lord Nick. Do you know him? (whimsical orchestral music) I pray you, I have a mind to speak with the Lord Nick. Do you know him? - Do you mean, Master Nick? The one who copied down all the Greek Tragedies just to feel their lofty weight? - Mm, the same. - Do you mean Master Nick, who slew a den of dragons, (Beatrice gasping) (Kate mimics blood spurting) just to save a sweet maid and her charmingly crooked smile? - The very same. - Huh, do you mean Master Nick, who hath played every role upon the stage, that our audience has forgotten the poor character's name, and simply say, huh, play us one of Master Nick's. - It's true. - Indeed, you know him well. - No, in truth, I do not know him. (group applauding) (atmospheric orchestral music) - In case your new place is infested. - Oh. - It's a good compass. In case you lose your way. - Thank you, Viola. - Mm-hmm. - You're welcome. (Nick sighing) (dramatic orchestral music) - [Ophelia] Don't stop coming. (sighing) - I'll see what I can do. (atmospheric orchestral music) You warm my heart. (dramatic orchestral music) (Nick mumbling) - I love cake. I love masticating cake. - Good job. - Really? - Yeah, you actually used that word right. - Thanks. That's very gratuitous of you, Kate. (fork scraping plate) - Did you write all that? - Yeah. (chuckling) - Not bad. - Ah, I did what I could. - I'm sure he will remember it when things get tough out there. (group laughing) I'm really gonna miss that goofy bastard. Our ward is 10 times worse than this one. - Sorry. - Oh, don't be. I break bread with kings who have lost their kingdoms, jesters who have forgotten their jests, the heroes who have forgotten their quests. (Beatrice chuckling) We have one old man, stands by the window everyday, says he's waiting for his three daughters to visit him. I've never seen them. Madness is a lonely place, Beatrice. There is always going to be people in here, and I understand wanting to help, but don't forget about yourself. Don't stay in here, Beatrice. This place is not for you. - Then why are you still here? - Too much good material. (Beatrice chuckling) (dramatic orchestral music) - Has anyone seen Julie? (dramatic orchestral music) (dog barking) (phone ringing) - [Benedick On Voicemail] Hi, you've reached Benedick. Make me happy. (voicemail beeping) - I'm sorry. (knocking on door) - It's visiting hours, Beatrice. Beatrice? - I'm not expecting anyone. - Well, they came anyways. (atmospheric piano music) (group chattering) - That's why you're here, get your mind to right this thing. (atmospheric piano music) - [Beatrice] Hi. - Hi. - I didn't think you were coming today. - I wasn't too sure, either. - I'm glad you did. What's that? - A surprise. (Benedick chuckling) - I'm not hungry. - Wait, wait, wait. I just realized with all this fuss over a sandwich, I never even tried it. Why don't we see what all the hubbabaloo is about? Mm, that's a damn fine sandwich. - Benedick-- - Oh, my God. Shh, don't talk to me. Shit, this is good. - [Nurse Marlowe] Shh. - Sorry. You know, we should totally have these at the reception next time. - Next time? - Well, if I didn't know these were waiting for me afterwards, I'd have left to. - You're teasing me. - Nope. Beatrice, I, I know this me trying to make you laugh. I guess what I'm trying to say with the sandwich, is I wanna be with you. Even if it is a socially divergent you. (Beatrice chuckling) Just not this socially divergent, like I want you home. - I wanna come home, too. It's that, I have plan, and I know I just need a little bit more time-- - How 'bout this? How 'bout we try not having a plan? How 'bout we just see how things go? And I will be here. Eat your sandwich. (Beatrice chuckling) (upbeat orchestral music) (sandwich wrappers crackling) (Beatrice chuckling) - It's really good. - Mm-hmm. - It's better with the dip, though. (Benedick chuckling) - So, is there anything you'd like to talk about today? - Yes. I'd to talk about how I walked out on my own wedding. Happiness often sneaks in through a door, you didn't know you left open. I think I'm starting to understand that now. The hard thing is, if I wanna get better, I think I have to stop talking to you. - Beatrice? (dramatic orchestral music) - And you sir, have you not... (dramatic orchestral music) (upbeat choral music)
