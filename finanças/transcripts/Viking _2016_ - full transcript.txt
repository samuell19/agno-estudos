«HISTORY - IT IS A SYMPTON, OF WHICH WE ARE SICK» MAO TSE-TUNG YEAR 977. PAGAN RUSSIA. THE RURIK FAMILY RULES SCANDINAVIAN LANDS AND COMMERCIAL ROUTE OF THE VAREGUES TO THE GREEKS, [THE LAND OF VIKINGS] A VIKING TERRITORY ALONG THE NORTH TO THE ROMAN EMPIRE TO THE SOUTH. [KORSUN] AFTER THE DEATH OF GRAND PRINCE SVIATOSLAV I, HIS THREE SONS DIVIDED THEIR POSSESSIONS. IN KIEV, THE ELDEST SON YAROPOLK. [KIEV] THE SECOND SON OLEG IN DREVLIANS TERRITORY, AND THE YOUNGEST, VLADIMIR, IN NOVGOROD. [OVRUCH] OLEG ENVY PRINCE YAROPOLK AND NEGOTIATES ALLIANCE, [NOVGOROD] WITH AN OLD ENEMY OF RURIK'S, - PRINCE ROGVOLOD OF POLOTSK. [POLOTSK] When I close my eyes, I see the forest in winter. The cold, white snow speaks about death. What happened here, profoundly changed our lives. POLOTSK From there will go. Have you heard this alone?!.. All my life I served the Rurik house. Why did I choose your son Oleg? Because he was crazy just like his father. Although not so smart. In the forest we were not the only ones. After them! C'mon, C'mon... There were also others. - Here! - Come on... Where's my axe? What's that?.. Drop it. We are your brother's people! This is our hunt and our prey. Take it. Which brother? I have two. Ah? The youngest? Vladimir? Nope. We are from Kiev. Enough, enough! - He serves to Yaropolk. - We can share. - We're not greedy. - Share? - Share... Yaropolk has the best soldiers. The largest castle. And this is still little. What are you waiting for? Stop! It's Yaropolk. Talk to your brother. We'll pay him. A ransom for dead will pay, and that's all. You killed my soldier. How should I deal with you? I have a wedding present. For her bride. - Your men wanted to catch him. - I also came for a wedding present. Yeah... For you. Bring it to me. I did not invite you! We're going to Polotsk. The bride is waiting for us. It's easier to talk outside the wall. We have to catch up. All. POLOTSK Let's go! There are still people on the slopes. I can see for myself. Move faster! Out of the way! Quick! This is their war. Close! Spilled blood calls of revenge. Yaropolk decided to sacrifice me. Right here, in the house of your enemy, Prince Rogovold. So that everyone knew that Yaropolk is not to blame for Oleg's death. But his brother's blood was upon him. Yaropolk! Answer me. Why the hell did he run in front of me? Did I pushed him? - Gives! - Your men were chasing us! You served my father. He is dead. And you live. You served my brother. In here. And you live. Maybe I live. Because you do not come serve to me. Yeah... That's where your place is. Execute him. He did not to save my brother. If you are against the law, he says, We'll leave you at the gate. Is this your last word? Come on. Get off me! - Are you ready? - Wait... wait. Yes. Hold my hair. Not to get dirty while displaying in the eyes of the god of thy father. Tell my father... I buried the god of war! You'll have to say this to him. Hand... They do not twist their heads twice. Stand up! That's right! By law: two times heads do not cut. He has that right. Step back! Varyazhko, we have to keep him back. Come back! Let it go! He's a true. It was not necessary to allow to leave. Remember Yaropolk! You're guilty of Oleg's death! Do you love the law? By law you will have revenge! Vladimir is still alive! You see... > Here is Polotsk. The applicant negotiates on the other side. First I fought for the prince of Novgorod, and then by the Vikings to the north. Now we're here. - Yaropolk is not my enemy. - Neither friend. You wanted to fight for the two brothers. You helped me, too. This is not my war... - Now it's yours too. - Is that why you came? Father! Who's the suitor? I'm, Vladimir! Do not rush. Prince of the Rurik's House. Vladimir? I've heard. It's true that you ran away in fear of your brother's soldiers? To the north, is not it? I was with the Vikings. Huh... And why did you come here then? - You will not find your brother here. - I came to you. It's my pleasure to meet you. I want to unite our homes. Take this, local custom. Will I be happy there? Will I go with you to war? We'll both be happier. Unless you are afraid. Come and bring your subjects. So? Do you accept? It seems that she does not like chickens. - You came for the soldiers. - I want you, not soldiers. Father, is not for me but for you. Wait. Let's talk. - Wait. - The interview is over. None of this will happen. - You do not know me well. - I know all about you! - Shut up! - You know what? - To tell? - Shut up! - Speak. - Still say?! - Well, do it. Do not you dare answer! You are the son of a slave. If I marry you, I'll clean the boots of the slave's son. Shut up! - He's not a Prince? - It's a prince! Your brother, maybe I'll take it. He's a prince. But you, you're nobody. Are you sure? - I love my mom! - Come on. Take your son away. It was his first fight. To his brothers he was not a prince, but the son of a slave. By law he had the right to make war with the older brother, Grand Prince Yaropolk, to become equal to him. More smoke, smokes! The smoke! Vladimir wanted alliance with the Prince of Pololsk, and now we fight against it. Because the offense is not only a coward, or slave. Let's prepare a berserk attack. I'm going with the Vikings. Let's attack the old gate. Look at me. Let along with this cup. The sacred fury and strength of the beast will enter you. Take revenge on them! Kill them all! Kill them all! You came without an invitation. Give him a cup of rage! You can, become one of us. Vladimir! Vladimir! Go! She changed her mind and wants to take off his boots. - Get up! - Leave her! And them, too? They killed them. Are you going to hide here? What did you do? Let me go! Now the whole family together. - Let me go! - Lie down, lie down said. - Leave her. - What? - Come with me. - She wants revenge. Where are we going? - And he too. - He'll go to war, too? There'll be no war. We will go peacefully. Go away from here. - What you mean? - My brother and I'll be equal. Yaropolk must pay for Oleg's death. A ransom, for me and my people. Yaropolk killed Oleg. Have you forgotten? People do not change. Let's go to Kiev. Peacefully. You come with me. You're be my wife. I'm going to love it. KIEV You'll approach the sorcerer. Hey! I am brother of your prince's. I'm looking for Yaropolk. I want to talk with him. Let's go. Where is everyone? Why you so silent. The people fled. Come take a look. It's your father's ax. Looks like the place is occupied. Do you want to know why, people do not change? Because they do not want to. Yaropolk was about a day trip from Kiev. He had recruited a large army for us to defeat with a single blow. Vladimir sent a messengers and proposed a meeting. Jaropek sent a word that, bastard has no right to judge him. Kiev became a trap for us. But fate smiled at us. Is this a toy? - Where did you get it? - I found here. The ship. Their ship is faster than mine! Good sword! We saw Yaropolk's army. We thought it was him. But it was a woman! Who is she? - I am your brother's wife. - My brother. What are you doing here? Does your husband send you? Yaropolk sent me to home. To Korsun during the war. Bishop Anastasius gives me safe passage. - To Korsun? (Byzantine City) - Yaropolk heard about Polotzk. Why did my brother send you? With me. They are Glina rowers. He wants to dunk people there. - He was your brother's soldier. - Yeah. Look at me. Come on, I'm talk with you. Come on. How is it? Let's go. Show me the hand. Sit down. You will not find treasures here. Yaropolk took it all. For what? Recruit soldiers. Not this mean. Why should I save your life, huh? I'll bring Yaropolk here. Do you think he will listen to you?.. You have Irina. She is pregnant. Yaropolk Camp Outpost Enough! I said, Stop! - Enough! - That was enough. Enough! Enough! Ask him... Where is your wife. Is she alive? She's alive and well. How much he asks for it? Nothing. They wait for you. He want to talk about peace. Do not go there. We need to stop in front of the city with the army. Only after this you can talk. Where did you get that? Vladimir sent it to you. Show the army and bring it out of the wall. By Irina. We're according. Why not you, give the name of my son? Huh?! Do not be angry! Hey! He returned! Where is my wife? Irina, you're waiting your husband. You okay? Wait. Where is my brother? Waiting for you. - Be careful. - Are you going without me? Here. They dug the whole yard. Lost something? He's already found it. You come with me. Where did you find it? Where was there is no more. - I thought Oleg had stolen. - He stole. Granny buried him in the courtyard. When digging in my back yard, I found it. Grandmother. What will we do now? We'll talk. No! No! Where are you going, where to? Why? Easy, easy guys! Stop! Rejoice! The Grand Prince Yaropolk sits at table with his father. Rejoice! Yaropolk! Go away! Let him go. Let it go! Let it go! Go away and tell the others. The war is over. Where's Vladimir? Vladimir? Vladimir is the Grand Prince. He is a nobody! Son of a slave! People like him do not deserve to live! Wait! Fedor! Promise me you'll protect Irina! If she is still alive. Hold on. They went to Kiev. Vladimir promised to forgive everyone. Not all are traitors. And we'll... against all? They are right. Many of them. If there are many, they are not traitors? I swear with blood. Revenge against Vladimir. I'll die for the previous life. Only the the bastard's blood will make me turn back. Have mercy, sir. Vladimir stopped the war and people accepted the death of Yaropolk. But Vladimir was adopted and remained like a bastard... a foreigner. To maintain its position, you would have to be more than his brother. He became greater than his father. At night, the city waited for the dead prince will come, to take revenge. Tell me, who? Dead man will take revenge. You. Put your hands down! Did you try to revive him? - He died. - Do not lie! Have you prayed for him? I prayed for... about getting up. You do not know, about the dead? They'll get up and go. Resurrected? Right? That's not him. You should not be afraid. I'll raise your son as mine. Trust me. I will be as strong as our father. The old gods could not protect Yaropolk. So Vladimir dropped them from the hill. He took from the ground the god of his father to gain his strength. So that everyone could see that he the same a great prince as was his father. But the god Svyatoslav's loved a human blood. For this he was buried when his father died. I live. He is hungry and asks for food. Silence, it can still rise. I give my brother to my father's god. He asks for fresh blood. A living body. Are you worthy of the god of your father? Bring your sacrifice! Stay with me. Come on. My father's God is God of luck and glory! He protect us all! Please join me! PECHENIZHYN COUNTRY'S BORDERS If we kill bastard, Irina climbs to the throne. And we will rule together. And we have the Pechenegues. Yep, Pechenegues. I didn't think they would come. This is their watch, they saw smoke. We need your commander. Commander! Yaropolk is dead. We have their treasures. You can be rich. But in return, help me to kill a Russian prince. - Do you remember the fort in the rotten valley? - I remember. Please wait there. We raise. Pechenegues! Pechenegues! What are you waiting for? Quick! Quick! Follow me! No! Dont do that! Call back your people! Do you think Kiev will have another prince? - What? - If you want, I'll give it to you! I can dropped him it to you! At the sun will mature! Come back! Come back! All back! - Help me please! - Take your hands off! Get out of here. Give me back Irina. - It's good. - Give to me and I'm leaving now! You'll save the city. You do not believe me. Believe me for this dead Yaropolk. I have his treasures. I pay and they leave immediately. All. No one else dies! Give me Irina. Vladimir! I spared your life. What did you do to him? If you change your mind, you know where to find me. The new prince chose it a war. Let me go, please. Let me go. You hear that? Save yourself and the city, please. Let her go. Gives us hope. I can protect her. Trust me. Why are you here? Enemies out there! The enemy can be anyone who does not keep his word. We do not fight for free, so I advise you to hurry for paying us. It is not enough! How do we decide? I thought, That you were warriors You are traders! You owe us more! Give the Berserk! Hey! Hey! For your gold we will give you a soldier. But it's the best! The Pechenegues were preparing for the invasion, Varyazhko occupied the entire length of the field nearby Kiev. Then Vladimir decided to put all the soldiers at the gate. To lure their cavalry to the walls. Wheels on the wall. Everyone knew they would not leave, then they went willingly. - On my signal, go to the wall immediately! - Roger that! The captain was Fedor, former commander of Yaropolk. Although confessing a strange faith for all of us, but he was a great warrior. Oh God, save me and protect me. Give this to Ivan, my son. - Good luck. - Everything is in hands of my heavenly father. Are you the son of the Christian god? God's servant. Nothing else. Let him help you. Faster! Quickly! Come on! Move forvard! Push it up! Come on! All ahead! All together! Keep the same pace! All join in a circle! Close all the shields, close together! Shield to shields! Now! Open! Give a signal, signal. Faster. - Keep moving! - Wheels! - It's over there! - Raise the wheel! Berserker, for fortification. For fortification, defend the gate! C'mon! Fire... - Fire! - Be careful not to set fire to the wall! In a dream I saw my mother. This means that, we not a die today. Give it to me. Burn it! Continue to launch! Water. Water to wall! Faster! Quickly! Raise up the water! Quick! - Lord have mercy. - God of my father helped us. God of my father helped us! Thank him for being alive! The pechenegues did not leave! Troops to stay with me in the wall. Well, touch him on the shoulder. You know how to make fire? - Of course. - Can you help me? - My father said to wait at home. - Do you know what to do to the gods to send rain? You can save us. I see my father! I see my father! I see my mother! I see my mother! - I see my Lord! - I see my Lord! They sit in a beautiful garden with flowering trees. They sit in a beautiful garden with flowering trees. They waiting for me! They waiting for me! They waiting for me! Father. All of them was saved. Let's go home! - They said I would save everyone. - They are save. Now You're going home! And then? The chosen boy. He will save us. Where is your husband? Vladimir! Father! Father! Come here! Get out of my way! Carefully. They celebrated. You hear? Why are not you with them? Do not worry. They believe that my father's strength returned. Vladimir! Vladimir! They want to kill him! Bet on your knife? If he survives, I'll give you my knife. Who do you serve? They are not gods! Tomorrow they'll rot! Cut down the pillars. Cut down the pillars! Vladimir! The prince! Over there... Go! Have mercy, sir. - Father? - What? We are going to die? No. I told you, death does not exist. (Praying orthodox prayer) (Praying orthodox prayer) - It's all for you. - What? (Praying orthodox prayer) Stop it! (Praying orthodox prayer) (Praying orthodox prayer) Come to me, my dear. Fedor!!! - Lord have a mercy! - Lord have a mercy! Fedor! What? What? If we do not sacrifice the most precious to the Gods... How do they understand that we love them?.. The offering was made. Gods will save us. He warned you. You are a foreigner. Like a Viking. A misfortune has come with you. You'll still meeting with him. Do you hear me. You'll meet him again. There is no death. But then. Do not let them see you like this. Let me go, please. Please. God of father did not accept our sacrifice. The Pechenegs did not leave. It was clear to all that the city could not be saved. Then Vladimir risked taking his luck by the throat. He agreed with Varyazhko about the meeting. Helmets. When it starts to rain again... Remember me. What is it? Anna. What? Anna. Greek name. Not yours. How do you understand that Anna? In Greek letters. You see: A. N. N. A. What does it mean? A... Anna. It's the grace of Godl They gave me to the monastery. What do you mean, grace? There is a woman's love. There is love from God. Grace is a gift of love. A God's gift. God's gift? Which God? God is only one. And he loves you. It can save you. Remember this. Take it with you, as a souvenir. Can go. Vladimir. Do not let them escape! Do not just stand there! Let's jump. Where is it? I know that you're still here. Are you afraid? Answer me! Hold it! Where are you going? We do not fight against the Romans. What? Where are you going? You promised. Commander! - Where is Rogneda? - Somewhere in temple. What are you thinking about? While Roman's ambassadors are here, listen?.. Pechenegs will not attack. The Romans are much stronger. Accepts what they offer, but do not believe them. You will always be a stranger to them. My father... ...agreed with Romans and Pechenegs did not touch him for many years. Agreed?.. They hired your father! And when he disobeyed... A you listen to me? They killed him, the hands of Pechenegs. We need to stop fearing... ...fearing when Pechenegs will attack. The night will pass, anf day will come. We need a strength of the Romans. These boxes with gold, and the leopard are a gift from the emperor for the prince. Emperor Basil Porphyrogen With the Grandchildren: Constantine VII and the co-regent, Anna Porfirogênito - their sister. God's grace. What? God's grace. The Emperor offers glory to you and your soldiers. If you conquered Korsun for him. In empire a rebellion, the city of Korsun on a side of rebels. The Emperor's reward for his help will be generous. The ambassador wants to know answer of prince. I will help you, but not for gold. What does the Prince mean? What do you want? The grace of God. - He want the grace of God? - Anna. It is impossible. Forget about it. The prince can not marry Anna. They even refused a German emperor. The prince can ask anything to Emperor, except for Anna. Say what you want. I want her. As a wife! You kept your word. Roman's gold strengthens morale. We go to the wall. - Are you going with others? - Where? To the temple. You need to ask Gods for protection from Pechenegs. The Romans are leaving. I already have all my sacrifices. Everybody? Get dressed. I will not give up my own life. You know very well that I will continue to the end. You'll have a son. What? Yes. Are you trying to kill us? Return to Polotsk. What more gift do you need? From which god? Throughout the night the noise echoed from the camp of pechengues. Someone screamed terribly outside the walls. Everyone was preparing for the worst. Yes, Romans agreed to give Vladimir the emperor's sister, Anna. Since they knew that we could not capture the stone city. And going to Korsun would be crazy. But this morning, it didn't matter. Everyone only thought about death, which lurked in the fog. Stop! Hey! - So, dude? - Where are the pechenegues? The Romans said that they had an alliance with Vladimir. Pechenegues do not fight with Romans. A son of captain's is held hostage by Romans, so that treaty of Pechenegs is kept. Does Irina live? Lives. Varyazhko took to Korsun. Prepare the men. Send messengers to all cities. I need a grace of God! How I can continue to live? Let's go to Korsun! KORSUN Give it a pass! Let's get a way! Irina! Come up. You'll translate it. I am Vladimir. I am your emperor's friend! I swear by my father's memory - Sviatoslav. I'll not leave here until I take your city. I want to know who among you. Who is going to open the gate? It will be you, or you. Maybe it's you. I swear by memory of my ancestors. I am not kill anyone. No one will touch them! Save yourself and this city. Save yourself and this city. Save yourself and the city. Tie it along with the bracelet. That he knew from whom it was. Quietly, quietly. What was it? Take a look. Wait, do you believe in him? She told me everything. On water that flows down the mountain to supply the city. Tell me, do you know everything about her or only you? - I'm checking this out. - Where is he? Ah? On the soapstone. So you drew up a plan? And sent? Bishop! Come to me. Irina. It's the same thing. Why? What for? Irina, why? He's a bastard, a slave! Why did you tell him? Vladimir will not spare him. Now he will find a way to leave the city without a water source! You betrayed us all! You betrayed us... Father. Accept my confession. I have sinned. He helped us. And I asked to send an arrow not to save the city. For him. Look at me! Swear... When assassin enters the city you will do everything that he can not find you. Swear... Swear or I'll kill the child. Run away from the city, disappear! Swear to me! Because I'm going to kill the baby! No... You are breaking my heart. Are these two trees? - Where's the tube? - The city is on that side. Everyone understood that the city could not be captured by a long siege. The soldiers gathered to go home. And to stop them, Vladimir ordered to be dragged ships in to mountain. Those who fled the steppe were met by Pechenegs. They stood behind us. The water pipe was Vladimir's only hope. Rejoice, prince! I was a first of the Vikings to come to help you. Where are the others? Others? Sleeping. They mixed wine with beer. Have you been in a Romans city? There are places where water pipe starts even further from the city than here. You've heard about it? Sveneld! It's you? Whenever I encounter, is digging a grave. But not for me. I will bury its bones. Bastard! You see this? That is for you. Hardly persuaded the Pechenegs, they just wanted to kill you. They say that you are a sheep. Woman spoke to you, and you believed it? What're you standing for! Bring shields and spears, quickly. Quickly! Your luck has returned. Ships. - Throw the boat. - Let's go. Follow me! Hey, you bastard! Where did you hurry? We tell the Romans that you and your men killed. Remove the brackets! That ship, fast! Where did you go? Push! Push! Where are the ships? Hurry up here! Vikings always appear at the right time! Push! Push! Wait! Vladimir... That's enough, brother! Go home. And where is my home now? Look old man! The slave was born. And he thinks he is a slave to be saved. Well, you say, here? If you say, you die easier. Without suffering. - And you ask Anastas... - Yeah. - He knows the location. - I'll ask. And bastard thought that Irina told him the truth. He didn't say anything. She just gave it to me. Then betrayed him. Where is she? She swore by God she would not see you again. Where is she? And his wife, Where? Recessed or dismissed? Did you come here for a new woman? Your brother - Yaropolk - he loved you. And you killed him. Not them. You! Who will take revenge? You're only one left. They're all dead. Now you can chase yourself. Take revenge on yourself. I see my master... I see you. Prince! We found water. Here she is! Come on! Do it... You're lying ... You do not see anything. You do not see anything. - Come on. - I did not kill my brother. And I'll not kill you. Where is Anastas? You can't enter here with weapons. Your? Where is Irina? She is gone. Two days ago. But where, I do not know. Lies. In this place you can not lie. Why do you need it? You are the Emperor's friend. You got your sister Anna. Yes, they have. Here immersed in water? Here. But first you have to talk. With me. Speak? Tell me about all bad things that you remember. Those are the rules. If you don't want it now, you can come later. When you're ready. Better now than later. What can I say? Whatever you want. Something bad... As a child, I stole a boat from my brother. What happened then? So I killed him. Because of toy? Really killed him? Really. That is all? Do not. I took my wife by force. And her mother watched. And her father looked. Then I killed my wife's mother and his father. With your own hands? Personally. I killed a lot of people. My best soldier. His son also died. So... It's your fault? Father... Who would it be? Wait. Wait. Do you have any water? Wait. Hold on. Pure water is you. At birth. And this you stole a toy from your brother. This is when you killed your brother. It's when you killed your wife's father. Then the mother of his wife. Then when that warrior died. Also his son died. And now you. Know, God loves you. And he can purify you with his fire. Now you can drink? It can. Just stinks a little. Emperor, right? When you go to the temple with him, tell me. Let's go together. Everyone will be there. - Where? - To the temple. We'll go and say: "We would like to accept a new faith in the wake of our prince". - What? - What would I do without you? How can you do it without me? Where I can go without you? I would have go myself, but I'll not be allowed there alone. They will not let me close. Where will not they let you in? To emperor. You can only talk with him. They say that he is very dexterous. If you strike like this... Here you repulsed the blow. And he will take it. Here's how to hit. Do not worry. I'll make the loop myself. Come to him, smile. You will say to him: "I love you, brother"... ..."I love your God". And the main thing is to strike accurately. And that's all. They will no longer have an emperor. Do you understand? Get revenge for your father. - No. - No what? I'll not kill anymore. You're still your father's son. Death does not exist. You rise from the dead. You believe that? Well, I gotta see. What do you want to see? I'll kill you and then you get up from the dead. Come to me and I'll believe. You said that death does not exist. So that you can be resurrected. Come on, let's go! There is no death! There is no death! I believed in you! And you betrayed me! You are a slave! You will die as a slave and a traitor! You betrayed me! Death exists and you know it! I will not die a peaceful death! You're right! You have to die like a warrior! I don't. I'll not take revenge on you. - Forget it, believe me. - Who do you want to fool, huh? People don't change. Why should they change. Come on. Let's do this! You need to see it to believe it. See what? I'm ready. Come on. Get your sword! You have to die like a warrior! Not as a slave! I am a slave of God not anymore. The sound of the sea tells me about eternity, but when I close my eyes... I see a winter forest. Cold and white snow tell me about death. Why I am not kill him? He became a part of me in this life. But I will not have another life. Follow me! Come into water. Say your names!
