Duoduo! Duoduo! Duoduo! Duoduo. Duoduo! Duoduo! Duoduo! Duoduo! [Lost, Found] We meet again. Why didn't you tell us everything last time? Do you have any clear photographs of Sun Fang? The girl and nanny disappeared during the day. Why did you file the case at night? I work during the day. Were you busy? Then why did you report false information? When a child is lost, our search radius is 100 km in the first hour. Two hundred kilometers in the second hour. For three hours and up, we will expand to 500 km. Right now, it has been upwards of ten hours since the child was lost. What the hell were you thinking? It's your own child so you're not too worried? Can you check every security feed in the city? Every security feed in the city? Do you have any idea how long that would take? All the money in the account was withdrawn. I could hear Duoduo crying, and Sun Fang. The art of illusion, heard of it? You need something? Hey, what are you doing? Enough! Tell me what you did with Duoduo! - Where did you take her! - Calm down! Calm down! Calm down! Where did you take her? This is a police station. Be civil. Calm down. She and that nanny were working together! They collaborated and kidnapped Duoduo from us! I went to their house before. That nanny wouldn't even let me in the door! What's that about? Sun Fang told me she was waiting for me to be gone to take Duoduo away. So I told Sun Fang not to let her in the house. That's why I said they're working together! Otherwise, that nanny wouldn't dare treat me like that! I can't believe you'd do something like this over custody rights! You're her mother! How could you do something like this? I want my granddaughter back! Give her back to me! Give her back to me! Li Jie! How could you do this? I know I wasted time. I made an error in judgment. But please, trust me on this. Sun Fang is the one who took Duoduo. Her blood alcohol levels aren't even 0.2%. That doesn't count as drunk driving, right? We still have to do something. Thanks. That cop, Officer Liu, is particularly annoying. He won't stop asking me about custody rights. I told him everything. What does he want? What do they suspect me of doing? Li Jie, tell me what's on your mind. Get it off your chest so I can at least share your worries. The more you sit on it, the worse you'll feel. So you think I kidnapped my own child? In custody fights, no matter what, you have to hold on to your child. Hiding your child as a last-resort tactic is fine, too. The minute your opponent gets hold of the child, you're in a passive position. You were the one who taught me that. By the way, there's something else. Zhu Min is still in hospital. They said she's not out of danger yet. I need to use the bathroom. I'll go with you. Stay here. [One day earlier] Duoduo, stop crawling. Where did I puke last night? I cleaned it up. What happened to your head? I just bumped it. Duoduo, why did you throw socks on the floor? Be careful. Come here. Let's put your little socks on, or you'll catch a cold. There. Thank you. - Ma'am– - Duoduo, Mommy's going to work. Come give Mommy a hug! Come here! Come here, Sweetie! Come say goodbye to your mommy. Look at your runny nose. Duoduo, that's dirty. It's fine. Toddlers don't understand the concept. I told you not to run around barefoot, didn't I? Duoduo, come here. Now, listen to Mommy. Don't wipe your nose on other people's clothes. That kind of behavior is very rude. Understand? Yes, you do. Say goodbye to Mommy. Bye, Mommy. Good girl. Ma'am. Ma'am. I need to tell you something. Tell me when I come back. Hello? No way. The more she tries, the worse it is for her. Bye, bye. Yeah, exactly. How are you supposed to raise a child without money these days? Of course, I have an idea. It costs over 300,000 yuan a year to care for a child ($300,000 RMB is equivalent to $42,000 USD), and that will be the defendant's potential support liability. The plaintiff filed that she quit her job after marriage. She doesn't have any income. Even if she manages to feed herself, there's no guarantee she can support or educate the child. More than that, I've found something else that should be good for our case. You'll know in a little bit. Regarding the source of income, there are some points we'd like to place on record. First, four years ago, the plaintiff resigned from her job because she discovered she was pregnant, and wanted to focus on raising the child. Second, the plaintiff, Zhu Min, graduated from Jiangcheng University of Technology. She has an advanced degree, and is completely capable of finding another job. There is another point I'd like to emphasize. The parties are divorcing because the defendant committed adultery. Your Honor, I have a copy of the plaintiff's treatment and diagnosis records here from the plaintiff's psychologist. Since 2013, the plaintiff has been treated several times. We have adequate reason to doubt her conduct capability, as well as her psychological stability. What do you know? That was... when I was pregnant, I found out he was cheating on me! No need to thank me, Mr. Wang. I should also remind you to keep the child with you at all times. It's best to send the child away for a period of time. Even if the plaintiff gets a judgment, if she wants to take the child, the courts will have a hard time forcibly removing him. All right. Fine. We'll talk again soon. Okay. Bye. Not here yet. Darn it. Tian Ning wants an extension. I guessed he would. I'll go talk to him. Li Jie, at this point, I think you should try the soft approach. Go see your husband... ex-husband... and try to compromise. There's no need to go to court. Otherwise, it's trouble for both of us. What do you think? Timing and subtitles brought to you by The Viki's Legends Team ツ I'm sorry, I'm in a rush. You're an attorney, but you're also a woman. How could you even say those words? You're overthinking this. It's just a coincidence that your ex-husband is my client. My job here is to win this case. That's all there is to it. For my child, I gave up everything! Ms. Zhu, as an individual, I express my sympathy, but lawsuits are bloody processes. The law doesn't side with the strong without reason or protect the weak without reason. Four years ago, when you quit your job, you should have known this might happen. Just like you, I have a child, too. I have to take care of both my family and my work, precisely because I don't ever want to end up in your position. Please try to understand. [Department of Radiology (Radiation/CT/NMR)] [DR Equipment Resident Office] Is Tian Ning in? He's not here. Come in and have a seat. I'll wait outside. The number you dialed is busy. Duoduo. Duoduo! Duoduo! You're back so early! Mom. I still have things to do tonight. I just came back to have dinner with my Duoduo. Is that good? That's good! We just bought Mommy some catfish today. Here, I'll carry her. No problem; I'll take her. Sun Fang. Must be your period. I can see it on your pants. Don't worry. I'll cover you up. Busy day? What do you want? Don't test me. If we go to court, they'll find you are the guilty party. I'll leave you with nothing but the clothes on your back. I have an attorney, too. Let's just get to the point. You're ready to start your new life, right? I'm giving you a chance. I'll play the villain and say I initiated divorce. Then what about our child? You don't need to worry about her. I gave birth to her, and I can raise her. She's not just your daughter, you know. Since Duoduo was born, Mother has helped in her care, too. Mother said that she can't bear to lose her. Name your conditions. All we want is Duoduo. If you have any thoughts on the matter, discuss them with my mother. Tian Ning. Can you act like a man for once and make your own decisions? Do you think you're acting like a woman right now? Look at how we're acting right now. We're both disgusting people. Do you know why I'm insisting on keeping Duoduo? It's just because I don't want to see her end up like us. A woman's life should never be decided by love and marriage. She deserves more freedom than we got. Whatever. I don't even know what you're talking about. I just have one question for you. With your circumstances right now, are you capable of taking care of Duoduo? We get on just fine. We have a nanny at home. A nanny only takes care of her physical needs. Can a nanny educate Duoduo? At her age, with you changing nannies all the time, do you think she can even tell who the nanny is and who her mother is? Fine. Since you insist on custody, we can discuss this in court. My mother wants to see Duoduo. Don't try to stop her! Hello. Xiao Jiang? I'll be right there. Remember to tell them no drinking at dinner tonight. Good! Good! Mr. Wang, I think the next step in our business is to prepare the contracts. I'll be honest, our attorney here, Mrs. Li, usually works on commercial cases. It would be an under-utilization of her talents this time. I don't understand why you'd hesitate. Mr. Zhang, if your partner is as talented as she is beautiful, I don't know why I'd hesitate, either. Mr. Wang, a toast to you on Mrs. Li's behalf. Thanks, but no thanks. I'd rather take my toast with Attorney Li. I'll take that. I appreciate your trust, Mr. Wang. Of course, you have my trust. But I wonder, as your business partner, if I have yours as well. If you really do trust me, then you'll drink this cup for me, too. Good things come in pairs, after all. To pairs! Nice! Mr. Wang, you still haven't had your own drink. Got it. Nice! - Good drinker. Good drinker. - The rest of you drink too! - Come. - Come. Book a designated driver for me. Sun Fang? Did your mom take Duoduo? Didn't you say your mom was coming to see Duoduo? Then is Duoduo at your house or not? Sun Fang, why aren't you picking up your phone? What's going on? I'm very worried. Call me back as soon as you can. Who were you looking for just now? Sir, I'm from #1201, Unit One, Building Seven. Have you seen my daughter? She's an infant with short hair and big eyes. Usually our nanny carries her past here. Municipal police, the fire department, - and 120 emergency services raced to the scene - Sir. to put out the fire and evacuate the crowd. Sir... Your daughter? People pass by taking their children and dogs out for walks all day. Hard to say. Let's go. Take me to building management. I want to see the security tapes. Stop. Rewind it. Fast forward. Stop. Xiao Jiang, I'll call you later. I'm busy right now. Are you with Duoduo? What? Tian Ning's attorney called me. Nothing happened to Duoduo, right? No. Hey, Jie, did you watch the news? About the gas explosion in Liyuan Community. Zhu Min tried to kill herself. She's still in the hospital emergency room. Who? Our client's ex-wife. She really does have mental issues, doesn't she? Okay then. As long as Duoduo is all right. I was just a little worried. I mean, you're in the middle of a lawsuit. If something happened to Duoduo, that would give him leverage. Everything is fine. Don't worry. Thanks. [Electrical Riser] Hello. She's here. Come in. Close the door. The baby is crying! What happened to her? Don't even ask. The last nanny dropped her. That's awful. I can see why you had to fire her. She's a lot more careful. Is she your niece? Yes, she's my niece. What's her name? Sun Fang. Come on, show her your certificate. If you want to work here, you'll need to get checked for H. pylori (bacterial infection) too. Have you taken care of children before? I've taken care of my own child. Does she have any professional certifications? No. Be good. Be good. Be good... Sit here, okay? Mrs. Liu, let's talk. Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mrs. Liu. To be honest, your niece looks like she's not all there. She raised her own child? Is raising her own the same as taking care of someone else's? She's a lot more reliable than those young ladies. No professional certificates, no training. How is she reliable? She's smart. She learns quickly. Besides, beggars can't really be choosers. What are you talking about? Your daughter stopped crying. How about trying her for a week? Have you tried her cell phone? It never goes through. Why don't you go ask around Shangba Village? That's where all the migrant workers around here rent their rooms. Isn't she your niece? Don't you know where she lives? I only... met her there when I went out for a walk. What? She asked me to find her work. Saying she's my niece makes things easier. How the hell can you just lie to people? It's not that serious of a lie, right? Everyone says that. She promised me half of her first two months' salary. With her running off like this, I... How can you do this? What if she kidnaps someone's daughter? That's enough. Enough. Go call the police! As for you, why did you do that, lying to people? I was just trying to help! What time? This morning, at 10:24 a.m. I checked community security tapes. Once she left, they didn't return. Let's see the nanny's personal details. Calm down. Most of the times people report missing children, they return on their own within 24 hours. Sit down. That's impossible. My daughter is two years and a month old. Sit back down. I mean it, just try to stay calm. I'm looking it up right now. The process takes some time. Listen and don't speak, unless I tell you to. Starting right now, don't hang up the phone, and don't call the police. If you do what you're told, you'll see your daughter again. Find a place without other people. You were right, my daughter went home. Hey! Wait... [Basic Information of Permanent Resident: Sun Fang] Please, whatever you do, don't hurt my daughter. I'll do anything you want. I told you not to say anything! Do you want to watch your daughter die? Do you? No! I won't... I won't say anything. [China Merchants Bank, Account number 157*****1806] I can't. I don't have 500,000 yuan. You don't? Aren't you an attorney? You don't have 500,000 yuan? Is money more important than your daughter? No, look, I... I really don't have it. I really don't have it. How much do you have? A little over 284,000 yuan. Do you want me to cut your daughter in half? Don't! No! No! I... I really, really don't have it! Fine. Transfer it. Okay. When I count to ten, I'll hang up the phone. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. It's done! Huancheng Road, underground walkway. Find her yourself. Hello, 110? (Police) Duoduo! Duoduo! The case is filed. Where is she? In the bathroom. Stop. Enlarge that one. [Tian Ning] [Courier Package Receipt] Is Lin Xiaolu here? What do you want with me? I don't know you. Sun Fang! Hey, what are you doing? Get out! Get out! Get out of my room! Where is Sun Fang? Sun Fang sent you something. You know her. I don't know you. Get out. Sun Fang worked as my nanny. She kidnapped my daughter. That's none of my business. Get out. I just want my daughter back. You don't have to worry. All I need to know is where to find Sun Fang. She... She moved out three months ago. Before that, she lived here. I gave away what she sent me ages ago. What was it? Clothes. Children's clothes. She knew my sister-in-law was having a baby. So she sent me some clothes. She owed me some money. I knew I'd never get it back. Duoduo has too many clothes. She outgrows them before she can wear them. These are all from her grandma. She hasn't worn any of them. Is yours a boy or a girl? Girl. How old? One year, eight months, and two weeks. Then she can wear these. Did she really have a child? I never heard about it. Lulu, is this your relative? Let's go outside. Over here. Try this. I knew she was desperate for money. It used to drive her crazy. Every time I saw her like that, I thought she would do something to end herself over it. Whoever can finish this tray of liquor gets 2,000 yuan. You. Come on, that's not enough! All right, then. Two rows. 5,000 yuan! I'll do it. She can drink! Good job! Nice! Fangfang! Fangfang! Fangfang! Making you proud, isn't she? Yes, she is! Fangfang! Fangfang! Impressive. Darn right, that's impressive! Fangfang! Fangfang! She was borrowing money from everyone, and later on, she met a fool with money. What are you doing? He'll drown like that. Come on! Xiaolu, help me! That guy helped loan sharks do business, collect debts, pimp, and forge documents. A little bit of everything. One hell of a hustler. That hustler ended up falling for a broke girl. Fangfang was crazy, too. She'd disappear every few days just to tease him. They were both sick in the head. Fang. Get out! I'm changing! Fang. What? It's for you. The money... I'm really running a little short on funds right now. I really have to get back what you owe me soon... That's all I have. "Liver tissue activity levels..." Are you seriously that broke? You only have one liver! How can you live if you give it to someone else! Mind your own business. I'm minding this business! That's your liver! I'm not giving it to a man. So what if you're not giving it to a man? Turn right here. She knew someone from her village who runs a breakfast stall. She invited me there for breakfast before. I guess this is paying back the favor. Up ahead. There. This is the stall. This is all I have. Take a taxi back. Forget it. Thank you. Hi there! What can I get you? I'm looking for Sun Fang. Do you know where she is? What happened to her? I hired her as a nanny and she kidnapped my daughter. Then you should call the police. I did. But I can't wait. I don't know where she is. Aren't you from the same village? Yes. She used to eat here not long ago. How could you not know where she is? That was a long time ago! I don't know where she is now. - What are you doing? - You're part of the same gang. What are you saying? Who's part of the same gang? - The same gang. - Don't talk nonsense! Stop recording! The same gang? If I were part of the same gang, would I be standing here? Moreover, Sun Fang has a daughter! If she were to kidnap, she'd take a boy! What would she want with your daughter? Give me back my daughter! What are you doing? Get lost! Mommy! Don't cry... Take him inside! Inside! Inside! Sister. Sister. Sister, you have a child, too. I'm begging you. Help me save my child. Please. Her house is here, but she's gone. Sun Fang is from my village. We're poor. There's no water there. So we came here together. We got used to it here, and so we did not move back. I got married first, and had a son. After that, Fang found a man, too. Hong Jiabao. It's a celebration! Eat and drink all you want! Eat up! Drink up! Here you go! Here, have another drink! Have another drink! - Did she kick you? - The bride is assaulting people now! Are you going to do something about it? Can you keep her under control? She's kicking people! Can you control your woman? The bride kicked him! Her temper is way out of control! That man... Every time he got drunk, he'd beat her. - He gambled, too. - I'll kill you! At one time, he used to have a car garage, but he lost it in a bet. He was waiting for government compensation for demolition, but nothing comes easy in this world. When Sun Fang was pregnant, she had to come work for me. Why didn't she divorce him? You're ready early! What are you sewing? You won't be able to use that blanket now. Why not let our Hutou use it then? How about that? That b*stard! Let's have the baby. It'll all be better once I have the baby. Once I finish this blanket, Hutou can use it first. How about that? Hutou! Hutou, look! A little tiger! A little tiger. Isn't it a little tiger? Sometimes, I think it would've been fine, if she had given birth to a boy, or if her daughter hadn't been sick. What illness was it? Something about the liver. It was rare. Her husband said there was no cure. Do you have any idea what a monster you are? Even dogs and cats know to take care of their young. Didn't you hear the doctor say she won't live long? Why should we squander money in vain for her? Squander money in vain? If you won't get treatment for her, I will! Sun Fang! Get back here! It's the middle of the night! Where are you going? Have you seen her husband lately? He's the last person I'd want to see! Sun Fang came back once, when she brought her friend from work for breakfast. She asked to borrow money. By the way, there's this! There's this! She sent me this. Look. She said she was getting her daughter treatment at a hospital in the city. They were going to operate on her. After that... I didn't hear from her. [Haiying First Municipal Hospital] [Tian Ning] This way. Why are you running? I'm not! Her daughter and mine stayed at the same hospital. She has pictures. She also had my ex-husband's name card. Don't bother going. No one's at home. Her daughter's name is Zhuzhu. The original surname was Hong. Hong Zhuzhu. "Hong" as in "flood." "Zhu" as in "jewel." I don't know if they used that name to check into the hospital. Excuse me, Li Jie. What are you asking me to look into? Is this the person you saw in the hallway yesterday? I can't see clearly. This one? It might be. Unit zero five, come in. Unit zero five copies; over. We are at the hospital. Sun Fang's daughter is called Hong Zhuzhu. She suffers from congenital biliary atresia (bile trapped in the liver). It's a very rare disease. She needs a liver transplant, or she won't live past age two. Sun Fang planned to donate her own tissue. She was tested for compatibility. But she wasn't a match. The father's name is Hong Jiabao. He never came in for compatibility testing. Later, Sun Fang checked her daughter out of the hospital. This disease obviously requires taking medicine at home. But it also requires periodic hospital checkups. After the patient was discharged, she never came back for checkups. She wasn't reported dead. There's also no record of further checkups. I suspect the nanny kidnapped the victim's daughter for her liver. We'll talk about it later. These are all just speculations. They don't have any proof. Thank you. Where are you? I'm on the twentieth floor. Did you find the information? This way. Is it the nearest? Yes. They are in the same hospital room. There are three beds. You have three children in there, and three adults. Sometimes it's overcrowded, and they have to add beds. When children get sick, the adults get frantic. With the crowding, it was always loud and messy. As soon as she started singing to her daughter, everyone got quiet. Why did you stop? They're almost all asleep. The chief resident is here. I think this little fellow can go home next week. Our little friend here has congenital biliary atresia. She needs an urgent liver transplant. Her father hasn't come to take a compatibility test. Since she moved in here, I haven't seen her father even once! How can such an awful father exist? Hong Zhuzhu's family? Come outside for a moment. Your outstanding bills are getting to be too much. Last time, we all pitched in to help you, but we can't every... I know, I know. I'll pay it. Next Monday. Will that work? Monday? Monday, fine. Monday. Thank you. - Zhuzhu's awake! - Wow! You're such a good girl! Mommy needs to make a call, okay? You play with your bear. I have to go make a call. Taking care of one child is the same as two to me. She paid me. But not much. What happened next? Sun Fang! Quick, they're moving her! Hurry! Hey, what are you doing? Listen to me. Don't! We agreed you'd pay on Monday. It's already Thursday. We're overcrowded here. I can't help it. I have the money! I can pay you today! Please, leave her here! No, you'll get the same results treating her at home. Security! Security! Calm down! Calm down! Let go! Let go! Don't! Doctor! Doctor! Li Jie! Hurry up. Thank you. We do the rounds at 8:30 a.m. If you need anything, come look for me. Goodbye. Thank you. Goodbye Where did they go, after they left the hospital? I don't know, either. Tell me. I'll be right there. This looks more complicated than we thought. This is Xia, from our office. He's new. Hello. You're still using this old machine? Yeah, it's got some years on it. It's an antique! We just set up audio and video surveillance. We consider this thing priceless at the station. What have you been working on lately? Lately, I've been working on what you're looking at. What's up? Over at our station, it's all kinds of little things. I'll do it. Let me. I'm sorry. That was my fault. Mom? What are you doing here? Didn't I tell you to wait for news at home? How could something like this happen? My poor little Duoduo... My poor little Duoduo... If I have to wait, I want to wait where it helps. There are police here. Please just go home and wait for news. We're working on a case. Please cooperate. We found the girl. Get some people here! Get some people up here right now! Hello? We found the girl here. Get the forensics team now. Don't stand around like idiots! Seal the crime scene! The hallway, clear it out! It's not Duoduo. It's not Duoduo. Duoduo! Mom, it's not Duoduo. It's not Duoduo! It's not Duoduo! It's not Duoduo! It's not her. Hello? Hello? Sun Fang? Sun Fang? Zhuzhu? Zhuzhu? Zhuzhu, what's the matter? Zhuzhu... I'll take you to the hospital, okay? 120! (Ambulance) Number 7, Lane 4, Bahe Village. Did you get that? I know you can't drive in here. I'll wait for you on the main road. Okay? Number 7, Lane 4! Just wait for me! Can you get here? Number 7, Lane 4, Bahe Village. I'm on the main road. I don't know! There's a therapy clinic here. Where are you right now? Can you get here? Stop! Stop! Help! Can anyone hear me? Are there any taxis? Zhuzhu! Zhuzhu! Zhuzhu. Zhuzhu! Zhuzhu. Save my daughter! Help! Zhuzhu... Save my daughter! Zhuzhu! Zhuzhu. Zhuzhu, are you asleep? Don't be scared. You can sleep. I won't wake you up. Let Mommy sing for you. How is it? Get up! Our priority is to get his testimony. Don't be emotional and don't provoke him. Remember, our goal here is to find the nanny's location. And to find your daughter. You got it? Do you recognize him? Where have you seen him? In my building's elevator. Tell us. Tell you what? Are you playing dumb? Are you playing dumb with us? I'm the one who stole her 280,000 yuan. Don't talk about the 280,000 yuan right now. Where is she? Who? You don't know? I really don't. Where is my daughter? - Let go of him. - Where's my daughter? Where's my daughter? Where's my daughter! - How could you do this? - Where's my daughter? Where's my daughter? Where is my daughter! Where is my daughter! - What did you just say? - Where is my daughter! Where is my daughter? Where is my daughter? Where is my daughter? We all have trouble with our children. Can we get the money on Monday or not? I asked you a question. I've borrowed everything I can. I still haven't dug us out of the last hole. Where am I supposed to find more money? I'll figure it out myself. What am I to you? If it weren't for your child, would you even be with me? What do you take me for? A whoremaster? A pimp? A loan shark? A thief? What exactly do you think I am? I think of you as family. Have you thought about the fact that this child is a bottomless pit? How much longer can you keep going like this? Why don't you think about yourself for once? Darn it! Is she okay? Does she f***ing look okay? Do you f***ing have eyes? Can't you see her walking out of the building? - I didn't do it on purpose! - The f**k you didn't mean to! - Come here and look at her! Look! - What do we do about this? - I really didn't mean to do it! - What do we do about it? Try moving! Let's forget it! Forget it! - She suddenly ran out! - The f**k she did! Even if she did, could you not see her? - Man, my packages are... - The f**k if I care about your packages! Get out of here! I was overwhelmed with guilt. I got some money together to go see her. But by then, she was gone. She was a completely different person, too. They're looking for me everywhere, for the money we borrowed. Plus the runaway interest. I can pay it back. You can? How? I'll go be a nanny, and then give the child to you. Why would I want the child? You can go find a buyer. I found a buyer. We set a date. But she didn't show up. Zhang Bo, I want you to think hard. Think hard before you answer. I did think hard about it. I really don't know what happened to the child. Think again. I've got some crap luck, but she's doing even worse. I've never seen anyone with such crap luck. I told her I could only help her this one last time. You could only help her one last time? What did you help her do? This... I didn't do this! Did I say you did it? I only heard her tell me about it afterward. Who eats the carrots? - The little white bunny loves the carrots, doesn't it? - Hey! It is really not easy to find you. Whose child is this? We're still husband and wife, aren't we? I don't have anything to do with you. Fine, we can get a divorce. Recuperation fees. Husband abandonment fees. Psychological damages fees. Leave then. You might not care about me, but your employer sure will! How much do you want? Are we even now? I brought the wedding gifts from your parents. Let's end it without any hard feelings! You learned to fight, huh? See you later. I'm hanging up. I told her, I can only help you one last time. Give me the child tomorrow morning. If I can't pay back the money, I'm a dead man, too. You didn't kill the man or set the fire, and you didn't kidnap the child. You tell one hell of a good story. Get up! How many times have I said it? I don't know anything about the child! If I knew, why would I go to her house to look for Sun Fang? I f***ing wanted to ask you! She was working at your house. Where is she? Get in! Understood. Get in. We have a clue. The information center just told us. They found Sun Fang with Duoduo in surveillance video at a long-distance bus station last night. What gives you the right to stop me from entering? You're just a nanny! You don't have the right! Let me see my granddaughter! I don't care who you are! You're not coming in! Mother. In the future, if you want to see Duoduo, it's best if you call ahead of time and make an appointment. Don't you try to use your legal tricks on me. I'm Duoduo's grandmother. Why can't I see her? You are only her grandmother. I'm her mother. We'll see who gets custody in the end! Sun Fang, open the door. How many times have I told you? Don't put slippers in the shoe cabinet! Ma'am, I did what you told me and put the slippers on the shoe rack. Stop moving, okay? Or else we'll miss the vein. Where's her father? Have him come hold her down. Otherwise, I can't do it. I'll do it. Let me do it. Calm down. Don't cry. Let's not cry. Once you get your shot, we'll go home. I'll make you wontons, okay? I owe you a thank you for the other day. If Duoduo's grandma took her, it would be a lot of trouble. Did he beat you? Who? Duoduo's father. That wasn't it at all. Then why did you divorce him? Aren't things just fine the way they are now? Here comes the wave! Here comes the wave! Don't be scared, Zhuzhu. What? Let's go look at that one. - You want to go over there? - What? Go over there? - Okay. Let's go over there. - There's a little boat over there. Let's go look at the boat! Come on! Come on. Hurry. Get down and come to Mommy. Come here, Baby! There's a lot of sand right here. We'll make our sandcastle here. - The ocean is so beautiful. - The ocean is so beautiful. I like the ocean so much. I certainly like the ocean. What's on the other side of the ocean? On the other side of the ocean? An island, I think. An island? I'd love to go see the island. Okay. Then let's all go to the island one day. The island. The island! The next ferry leaves for Fenzhou Island at 11:00. You wait here. Wait here. We have to confirm she's on the ferry. Why should I wait? My daughter is with that psychopath right now! The boat is crowded! You'll get in the way. The moment we know something, we'll tell you. If we ask you to wait, just wait. Don't get in the way! How would I get in the way? That's my daughter! Stay off the ferry! The suspect is on the boat. The girl's parent is pursuing. Seal all exits. Send in special duty officers! Keep the ferry here! Get down! Get down! Sun Fang! Give my daughter back! Stay back! Any closer, and I'll jump! No! Don't! Duoduo, don't be scared. Mommy's here. What are you doing, Sun Fang? Duoduo is my daughter! I'm Duoduo's mother! She's not your child! You're not worthy to be a mother! You're not worthy! Now leave! Duoduo! Don't be afraid. Mommy's here. Sun Fang, let's talk after you put her down. We know everything that happened to you. If you have any conditions, let us know. You see how bad the wind is here. She'll get a cold up here. Let's go down and talk, all right? Come on, give me the child. I swear I'll jump! Don't push me! Sun Fang. Stay back! I met your hometown friend! She told me everything about you! That morning, this was what you wanted to tell me, right? Stay back! Stay back. - Nobody move! - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Sun Fang! I didn't take the time to understand you. I didn't know things were so hard for you. You were a good mother. Zhuzhu was a good child, too. She's gone already. She found release. She's not in pain anymore. Sun Fang. Stay back! I love my daughter very much, too. Just as much as you loved Zhuzhu. Duoduo is innocent. I'm the guilty one! Punish me instead! Punish me instead! Punish me, Sun Fang! You love Duoduo too, don't you? Duoduo. I'm begging you! I'm begging you... I'm begging you! Duoduo. You know I love you. You know I love you. I'm sorry, Duoduo. I'm sorry, Duoduo. Mommy! Daddy! Mommy! Daddy! Mommy! Daddy! Mommy! - Please, give her back to me. - Daddy! Mommy! Daddy! Mommy! Mommy! Duoduo! Duoduo! Six months ago, my nanny kidnapped my daughter. The two days I spent looking for her felt like I was trapped in hell. It also made me reconsider a lot of things. I began to deeply doubt the way I treated my child. I felt I wasn't fit to be a mother. I even felt having a child is the most selfish thing on the planet. It's using someone else's life to complete your own. People talk about the nobility of a mother's love. Actually, a mother's love for her child is just bearing the consequences of her own choices. The one who really deserves gratitude is the child. Children help their parents to grow, and allow us to feel a completely unencumbered love that we would even be willing to die to protect. It's a kind of freedom. Our era demands so much from women. If you choose to become a career woman, some people will say you neglect your family and are a terrible mother. If you choose to be a full-time mother, some people will think having children is a woman's natural duty, and doesn't count as a career. The fact is, because I worked hard, I had the right to choose; because I had a child, I learned the meaning of life, and had the courage to face the hardships of life. Once, I blamed Zhu Min for her choice, just as I've never understood my nanny. We three mothers faced different circumstances, and lived with our own problems. Zhu Min's dedication to her family is obvious. But in return, she lost everything, even the right to fight for her child's custody in a court of law. As an attorney, I know that it's impossible for me to make everyone think this is fair. But as a mother, I know what I shouldn't do right now. I hereby request Your Honor for full consideration of my opinion that the child's custody rights should be granted to Zhu Min. Any legal consequences, resulting from my words in court today, will be fully borne by myself. Thank you. Mommy loves you. Mommy wants to give you the best of everything. How much do you think I could get for my kidney? How about you consider the money you owe me as what you'd get for selling a kidney? Fang, keep your kidney for now. I still can't pay it back. Sometimes, I really just want to not care. But I just can't stop myself.
