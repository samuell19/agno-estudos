HIROSHIMA PRODUCED BY TAKEO KIKUCHI & TAKERO ITO SCREENPLAY BY YASUTARO YAGI CINEMATOGRAPHY BY SHUNICHIRO NAKAO & SUSUMU URASHIMA CAST: ISUZU YAMADA, EIJI OKADA, YOSHI KATO, YUMEJI TSUKIOKA YASUMI HARA, SHIZUE KAWARAZAKI, HATAE KISHI, HARUE TONE DIRECTED BY HIDEO SEKIGAWA At 02:45am, on August 6th, 1945, three B-29s took off from Tinian Island. An atomic bomb about to explode above humans for the first time hung menacingly in the bomb bay of the Enola Gay. The bomb carried autographs and jeering messages to the Japanese Emperor. After take-off, the crew got down to work. Colonel Tibbets conducted the routine tasks of piloting a B-29. Captain Van Kirk, the navigator, and Sergeant Stiborik, the radar operator, talked over the intercom, as they took bearings from the Northern Marianas and made radar wind runs. At 04:20, Captain Van Kirk announced that they would fly over Iwo Jima at 05:25. Soon, the reddening sky to east heralded the rising sun. The dark sea began to sparkle, and the sublime majesty of the view overcame Van Kirk. For a moment, the navigator forgot he was in a war and gave himself over to his thoughts. He suddenly remembered what was about to happen to the people of Hiroshima. His mission was bringing doom to those people. The gadget in the belly of his plane was a weapon far beyond imagination. It was an atomic bomb. The 20th century had seen the advent of a bomb powerful enough to kill every human being within a kilometer of its blast center. Worse still, the radioactivity from that bomb would do incalculable damage to all living creatures in the vicinity. Hiroshima would instantly become a city of corpses. That thought led Van Kirk to a feeling of utter emptiness. Overwhelmed by sadness and desperate for something to cling to, he suddenly recalled his mother's face. His mind soon returned to the mission he was on. Somewhere beyond those vast mountains of white clouds lay Japan, the land of the enemy. In about four hours, Hiroshima would be wiped off the map. But at this moment, no one yet knew this destiny. Did one feel any compassion for the poor devils about to die? Not when one thought of Pearl Harbor and of the Bataan Death March. They started the climb to their final altitude at 07:40. It wouldn't be long now. They were now only 25 miles from Japan. They would be there in no time. The bombing of the target would happen in the merest instant... Stop it! Stop it! Please, God, give us the courage and the strength... Her nose... her nose is bleeding. Are you all right? Michiko, are you in pain? I don't want to die. Leukemia... So is it the so-called A-bomb disease? Yes, I think we can say so. Pass this to Inoue. Inoue, this is from Kono. NOT FOR US: LETTERS FROM THE YOUTH OF EAST AND WEST GERMANY "First of all, Truman said clearly at the San Francisco Peace Conference, "'The United States has not forgotten Pearl Harbor and Bataan.' "So, I will speak plainly as a German..." Alright? Next, this tells us what we want to know the most. "I and most German intellectuals think "that in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, "after all about 200,000 unarmed and innocent Japanese "were used as guinea pigs for the testing of a new weapon. "I'm sure it is because the Japanese are a colored people. "Maybe you will be offended by what I say because I belong to the white race. "I can certainly understand this issue "more instinctively and intuitively than you, "just because I am white. "At any rate, this issue is not as simple as Pearl Harbor or Bataan. "Besides, at the end of war, "when it was believed that the Nazis had used toxic gas against Allied countries, "the United States had hysterically claimed "that this violated the Hague Conventions and was a crime against God and humanity. "But the United States itself used a weapon "that was ten times, a hundred times, more inhumane than toxic gas. "Besides, this attack was on the defenseless. "Therefore, this problem must be forthrightly condemned not only by Japan "but also by the world as a matter of common sense and conscience. "Unless God and Justice have disappeared from humanity and the world..." Raise your hand if you were exposed to radiation in the bombing. One third? Recently you seem to be visiting the hospital often. What's wrong? No doctor has told me exactly what my illness is. Do you have symptoms like nosebleeds? No, but my memory is fading, and slight wounds fester, and my eyes and body tire easily. I feel very listless, especially in summer. I no longer have the strength to remain standing. Everyone feels listless in summer, right? What's so funny? This is why we don't feel like talking about it at all! Of course, there are small differences, but everyone who was exposed to radiation is suffering as Serizawa said! And... we never talk about it, but we've always been afraid of dying from the A-bomb disease. But if we say that, you just laugh at us, saying that we're making too much of our experience and demanding attention for it. When Kono puts it like that, there's nothing that I can say. To be honest, until we listened to Dawn over Zero on the radio and Oba collapsed, I never understood how the A-bomb is eating away your bodies. I have heard a great deal about the sickness, but I thought Americans from the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission treated them. But I only found out a few days ago that the Americans are examining survivors, but not treating them. I'm ashamed that I haven't paid more attention to matters concerning the atomic bombing since I came to Hiroshima. I'm so sorry. You're not the only one. Most people even in Hiroshima don't know about this. Lately the media have been warning people around the world about the importance of peace and how terrible an atomic bomb is. But before telling the rest of the world, I want to tell Japanese people about the horror and inhumanity of the A-bomb. No, I want to tell the people of Hiroshima! I want to tell all of you! And you, Mr. Kitagawa, Oba has leukemia, which is caused by an increase in the number of leukocytes and there's no way to treat it. From what I have heard, there are 92,500 leukocytes in a single drop of her blood. LEUKOCYTES I think you've already learned this in physiology. Do you know how many leukocytes exist in normal human blood? Raise your hand if you know. - They're all victims. - Yeah, and it's fatal for them. Is there anyone who knows? Yes, Inoue? Yes, in one cubic millimeter, there are 6,000 to 8,000 leukocytes. And what is the function of leukocytes? Leukocytes are cells that are made in marrow and exist in blood. They defend against infectious disease and foreign materials by eating bacteria. That's right. Leukemia increases the number of useless leukocytes. Moreover, it decreases normal leukocytes. The body loses its ability to fight bacteria and eventually dies. As a consequence, normal functioning leukocytes decrease. Teacher? What? So is that what happened to the people who died when their leukocytes decreased to 1,000 or 2,000 after the flash-bang? Yes, it seems so. So the source of the disease is radiation, right? I'm not sure, but I think so. On the day of the bomb, Oba wasn't injured or burned, but she was exposed to radiation in her house, which was only a kilometer from ground zero. She suffered from radiation poisoning at the time. She lost a lot of hair, got purple spots on her body, had a high fever, and had blood in her stools and urine. Fortunately she survived and regained her health. But seven years later, this happens. Doctors say that the burns caused by the A-bomb may cause cancer, with no way to prevent it. Even if there were, there are few people who can treat it by themselves. However, once you make that public, people will become obsessed with blaming physical problems on the bomb. So if you don't do like Mr. Kikkawa, who survived and was bold enough to show his scars and demand money, or like the Hiroshima Maidens who receive treatment through the compassion of society, or like the tramps at Hiroshima Station who throw themselves on the mercy of travelers late at night, you'll live in the shadows. You'll hide your ugly scars as if you'd done something wrong. Maybe you'll be a construction laborer covering your keloids with towels. We also have a friend who's in a sorry state. I feel bad saying his name, but it's Endo. He was coming to school during the day and working at a cabaret in Nagarekawa at night. Now he's quit school and hangs out at a pachinko parlor every day. He'd been evacuated with his sister to the mountains, so he was gone at the time of the flash-bang, but the bomb killed his parents and brother. Endo and his sister were orphaned. At first, he took care of her by shining shoes, but one day she disappeared. After that, he joined a gang of delinquents and got locked up in the orphanage on Ninoshima. After that, his ex-soldier uncle took charge of him. Living with his poor uncle, Endo started working at a cabaret to make ends meet. He's been changing gradually. It makes me sad to think about him. Many excellent churches were built in postwar Hiroshima, and the sky in Hiroshima resounds with bells of peace morning and evening. The city built a Peace Bridge, a Peace Memorial Museum, and the Cenotaph where we dedicate ourselves to peace and pledge to never allow the mistake to happen again. But it's when I pass by the bank that I think of the bomb. The shadow of death created by the flash-bang, though it's faded a bit now, nobody even turns to look at it anymore. These days, we often hear military marches in the streets of Hiroshima. Every time I hear those, I get scared. Lately, people talk of returning to the old ways. I think it's good to remember Japan's magnificent past, because we are completely miserable now, but I worry that some might be preparing for war again using the cover of popular nostalgia. I'm afraid we'll get caught up in another war, and before we know it, we'll become the victims of another atomic bomb. Hearing the military marches brings all that up, and it terrifies me. Revere the Imperial Palace! Bow with utmost reverence! Eyes front! Today, the even-numbered group will head out for demolition work! You others will practice bamboo lance training at school! Stop looking around, you slacker! The fate of 100 million Japanese depends on the homeland battle! The Emperor deigned to make you his subjects! You must be grateful for this honor, and never allow your spirit of loyalty and patriotism to weaken! Think only of one thing... You must do everything possible to defeat the savage people of America and Britain! First, even-numbered groups, move out for demolition! All others, wait your turn! Dismissed! Round and round, you get dizzy! Round and round, you get dizzy! Akio! Sis, catch that dragonfly! I won't. I feel sorry for it. It's okay, as long as you don't kill it. Round and round, you get dizzy! It's a plane. It's a "B", Akio! Round and round, the plane gets dizzy! Machiko! Michiko! Akio! What are you doing? It's supper time. We're writing a letter to daddy. - That's fine, but do it after supper. - Okay. Air-raid alert. Michiko, turn on the radio. An enemy formation over Hiroshima Bay was attacked by the Imperial Air Force. The planes are now retreating to the southwest. However, the next formation is on its way north. The citizens of Hiroshima are to be on the lookout. I repeat... An enemy formation over Hiroshima Bay was attacked by the Imperial Air Force. The planes are now retreating... Mom, what's the matter with the Air Force? Why don't they quickly shoot down the planes? I'm hungry. Just be patient. What's daddy doing now? Shut up, I can't hear the broadcast. We won't be able to sleep tonight. At 07:31, the all-clear was sounded in Okayama and Hiroshima, by order of Central Command. At 07:31, the all-clear was sounded in Okayama and Hiroshima, by order of Central Command. The all-clear's been given! The all-clear's been given! - That lasted all night. - It was a long one! Hiroshima's not so easy to bomb. I was sure Hiroshima was the target this time. - What's the matter, ma'am? - I heard a baby's about to be born. Oh, that's some happy news. Mom and Machiko, look! The dragonfly's alive and doing well! You're so full of energy this morning. Come on, Akio. Let's go. Okay, sure. - We're going. - See you later. Be careful. Have a nice day! That's a "B", isn't it? Yeah, that's the sound of a "B". But the siren isn't going off. But it sure sounds like a "B". Mom! Teacher! - Mom! - Mom... Teacher... Mom! Mom! Akio! Michiko! Akio! Michiko! Akio! Kimi... Akio... Teacher! Teacher! Mom! Escape! Go without me! I'll get you out soon. Don't give up! No, I won't make it. Go without me! What are you saying? Hang on. Keep fighting! Please take care of the children. Don't give up! Please, go. Think of the children. Go rescue Ichiro! Heave ho! Heave ho! Soldier! Officer! Please help me! My wife is stuck under the house. Please! Officer, please! - Yoshiko! - Go!

Hold on. Hold on. Ichiro! Has anyone seen Ichiro Endo of Itchu Junior High? Ichiro Endo? Ichiro? Hey! Someone check my legs! Are they still there? Mommy... Hey, someone! I feel like I've lost my legs. Point one: it is the soldier's duty to be absolutely loyal! Shut up! Stop saying that! What good is it? Stop it! Stop! I am Command Staff Officer Otani! Are there any soldiers here? Are there any soldiers here? Everybody, follow me! Gather round, students of Itchu Junior High! Are you all here? Come here! Are you okay? Come on! We've got to hold on. Let's sing the school song! One, two, three... Hold on, everybody! Lend me that bag for a pillow. No! These books are very important for my studies. Mommy! Mommy! Lady, it's no use holding that dead child. You've got to burn the body soon. The war isn't over yet. Ichiro! Is Ichiro Endo here? Ichiro from Itchu Junior High! Has anyone seen Tomiko Oe? NAME UNKNOWN Banzai! Banzai! Long live the great empire of Japan! I'm a military general. Hey, salute me! Daddy? Are you looking for your father, son? Where's your house? Son! Son! Burn the bodies! Mommy! Is your child here? Yes, she is. Give this to her. I was taking it to school. Don't you want to eat it? I'm dying. Give this to your child. Stay strong! Stay strong! Stay strong! I'll tell you my name. If you meet my mother, please tell her... Mommy! Mommy... I'm cold. I'm cold... Shut up! Be quiet! Crying won't change anything! Mom! Hurray! Hurray! Hey! Pipe down. Brother!

PREFECTURAL GOVERNMENT OFFICE NOW AT EAST-SIDE POLICE PRECINCT I speak for the prefectural governor: "This damage has been caused "by the enemy trying to shatter our fighting spirit through brutal air raids. "Citizens of Hiroshima! The damage is considerable but not unusual in war. "I assure you that we are drawing up relief and restoration plans. "We will not be daunted by the enemy's attacks! "Our army will provide full support! Return immediately to your jobs! "The war must not stop, even for a day! "Show warm affection to your wounded brothers-in-arms, "nurse them, encourage them, and help them return swiftly to battle! "This disaster unfortunately has caused many casualties. "Don't be stupefied, "pay tribute to their memory and pray that their souls may rest in peace! "Then steel yourselves to the task "of revenging these deaths on our sworn enemy! "Anticipating victory, we will overcome every hardship, "and reaffirm our devotion to the war in the name of the Emperor! "August 7. Prefectural Governor Junshin Takano." How about using that lunch box. You can put more in that. But my daughter's ashes are inside. Ashes? - Is that a chick? - Yes. - Is it alive? - Hmm. Isn't it cute? - It's cute. - I'll give it to you. But I might not be able to keep it alive. - You never had a chick before? - No. ICHIRO ENDO, CONTACT THE YAMADAS. FATHER. ICHIRO ENDO Excuse me where is Ichiro Endo? He's a student of Itchu Junior High. I don't know. Look at all these people. You're right. I'll try to find him myself. Thank you. Ichiro Endo! Ichiro! Is Ichiro here? Endo! Someone's looking for you. Hey, Endo! Endo! Mister? Ichiro... It's too late. You're a student at Itchu, aren't you? - Where's your house? - In Teramachi. It might've burned down. Did he say anything before he died? Thanks for looking after him. Itchu was hit hard. When I went there to find Ichiro, I found bodies of students crushed under the school buildings and burned to skeletons. The swimming pool was full of bodies. Where were you... when it happened? Endo was injured in the classroom. He was rescued by a teacher. I was injured near the swimming pool. I can't remember how we got here. Try to persevere. It's been a long time since I carried him on my back. Goodbye. Take care of yourself. Goodbye... Endo. LONG LIVE THE EMPEROR LONG LIVE JAPAN We must promptly grasp the extent of the damage, restore the health of the civilians and calm the people down. The present estimate of human casualties is 200,000 affected, 10,000 dead, and 100,000 seriously wounded. I agree with the commander. Calming down the public is the priority. We must crack down hard on rumormongering. Especially about the new bomb, we must stress the value of the bomb shelters and give people hope. We must use it to foment greater hostility towards our enemies. - Agreed. - Agreed! I'm Asakawa from Osaka University. The Director General of the Osaka Navy Police asked me to determine whether the bomb dropped was atomic or not. We are of the opinion, like Dr. Nishina, that it was indeed an atomic bomb. How are you conducting your research? I measured the radioactive contamination with a gold leaf electroscope and photographic plate. Now I'm measuring leukocytes in the blood of the injured. Dr. Nishina, do you have any response to Dr. Asakawa? As I've said, I have no doubt that it was an atomic bomb. But to announce that it was an atomic bomb will do no good! Hmm... It'll have a negative impact. But Truman has already announced to the world that the US used an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. An American scientist has made it known that nothing will grow in the affected area for 75 years. That's an enemy lie. And even if it is true, the people haven't heard Truman. I object to announcing that it was an A-bomb. At this stage in the war, that would hurt the war effort. Only the military can judge whether it hurts the war effort or not, but the Americans dropped another bomb just like it on Nagasaki yesterday and announced they would drop more. In short, to give my honest opinion, now that the Americans have this bomb, we need to think carefully about continuing the war. We understand that you're speaking as a scientist, but scientists are also His Imperial Majesty's subjects and his children. The fate of the empire depends on this war. Negative behavior or speech will not be tolerated! The nation must support His Imperial Majesty, and dedicate our lives and everything we have to him! This is a core value of the Japanese race and our military! We must fear neither the Soviet Union's entry into the war yesterday, nor America's atomic bomb! We will defeat the atomic bomb! Japan will not win because of some armchair theory, but because of our fervent will, which burns as brightly as a 100 million stars! Yoko, is this your rice bowl? Yeah, it's mine. - Here's father's. - And this is mother's. This is Ichiro's. This is mine. This is mine. JAPAN ACCEPTS POTSDAM DECLARATION How is it in your neighborhood? Oh... mine? It's chaos there, too. I guess it would be. But is it true that no grass or trees will grow again in Hiroshima? No idea. They say the gas from the flash-bang has seeped into the ground and humans won't be able to live here for 70 years. I guess that's true. But that's what the American scientists say. Well, you know what, I don't even care. The flash-bang left my body like this, and I have no one to rely on. Doctor, please get me out of Hiroshima. Aren't there any hospitals in Kure or somewhere? Don't lie to us. Tell us truth. Nothing but lies! Making us go through all this, and then surrendering unconditionally? Do they want us to live or die? That's right. If we stay in Hiroshima, we'll die! Aren't there any hospitals outside this city? Move us! - That's right! - Calm down, everybody. Calm? How can we be calm? You believe that because of radioactivity from the bomb, for 70 years... Now tell us the truth! - What will you do? - Please hear me out. You're not the only ones in Hiroshima. We doctors are here as well. We would never try to fool you or deceive you. What are you going to do? Tell us the truth! We've done a number of studies. Yes, there is radioactivity in the ground of Hiroshima, but only a little. It's not enough to harm the human body. To verify this, we've planted radish seeds in the hospital garden. If they sprout and the radishes grow, then we have nothing to worry about. Please, just wait a little longer. Look! A dog! Get out of there! How's it looking, nurse? Not yet? You think they'll sprout? It'll never happen. Are you saying they won't? Those seeds? Grow? How could they? You mean it's alright if they don't? How would I know? Ask the Buddha. They've sprouted... they've sprouted! They've sprouted! - What? - They've sprouted! Open your mouth. Where were you when the flash-bang exploded? Near Hijiyama. And? I didn't suffer any burns... ...but I vomited a little bile. When did you start feeling bad? Four or five days ago. - Has your hair begun to fall out? - Yes. - It's gradually getting worse. - Gradually? Miss Okazaki... The Emperor's laughing. The Emperor's laughing! You bet he is. Everyone's laughing at us, because we're vomiting blood and dying one after another from fever. Mr. Endo? I had a dream about my children. How are you feeling? Not so good. They say that vitamin shots cure radiation sickness, but there's no way to get any. Vitamins work, huh? - I heard they do. - Really? I see... We had some vitamins over there. Really? So they're going to waste? I didn't even check whether they were burned or not. I completely forgot about the bomb shelter. Ah, someone's there! It's probably daddy. Ah, you must be Mr. Endo's kids. Your father was looking for you. He's in the hospital. Come on. - Is my mommy there, too? - You haven't heard yet? Your mother and brother died in the flash-bang. Were you both in the bomb shelter? Your father took your mother and brother's bones to the countryside where you'd been evacuated. But you all must've missed each other, and he's been searching for you since. Some relatives were taking care of him, but he came down with the A-bomb disease, and now he's in the hospital. Mr. Endo, your children are here. Your children! Quick! Talk to your father. Daddy! Yoko... Speak to your father, Yoko. He's not daddy! - He is. - No, no! Oh, dear... His face is so changed you can't recognize him. Yoko, come here. No way! Yoko! Yoko! YOKO "Hanguri." You listening, kid? "Hanguri. Hanguri." Try saying it. Idiot. It's "hanguri". Not "angry". Just think "half chestnut" - "han-guri". - What does "hanguri" mean? - I dunno. But if we say it, the "Hello" guys give us chocolate and bread. So we say "hanguri". Hey, kid, don't forget it. "Hanguri." Hey, baldy, you're next. "You gentleman, papa, mama, killed by flash-bang, all us hungry." "You gentleman, papa, mama, killed by flash-bang, hungry, hungry." HIROSHIMA PEACE FESTIVAL ENVOY OF PEACE That's the pigsty. - It was built by Yukio and the others. - Oh, I see. They did it all by themselves. Really? Hello. We try to teach the children skills and help them to get jobs. But not many get to go home with relatives, like Yukio. Thank you for your help. Yukio's happy. I hope you'll do your best for him. Thank you. Yours is a very tough job. Well, I'm new to this... ...so it was a struggle at first. You know, children are great escape artists. They escape from this island? What's the record for escapes from this island, Yukio? Twenty-eight, that was Oshita. - How about you, Yukio? - Seven times. - Do they swim? - Those who can swim, do so. But most make deals with the fishermen who work offshore. Back when cloth was hard to find, if the children offered blankets in exchange for a ride, they had a deal. Yukio escaped because he wanted to find his sister. Hey, are these real? Are you kidding? These are artificial. Yoko! Yoko! Damn. It's not her. What do you think his sister Yoko is doing? Glory to the Mystic Law of the Lotus Sutra... Hello. - Day off? - No... I just came home to change my bandage. Somehow, my leg hurts badly today. But you can't work a sewing machine with that leg, can you? You're right. But where's another job that pays you while you're learning? How about asking for welfare support? Don't be too proud. I'm not too proud. Tell them the truth. Your father's in bed with A-bomb disease. Your mother does nothing but chant sutras. Your fallen brother's son is still in elementary school. And you're handicapped. You're right. I'm going to ask again. Anyway, don't worry. I'll marry you and feed your whole family. Hey, Keiko! I earn 3,000 yen, right? I can't even buy a newspaper. I can go without, but I can't even afford my nephew's lunch fees, and that's only 150 yen a month. You wanted to talk? The other day, you said that you'd marry me. - Yes, I did. - What did you mean by that? I meant... nothing in particular. Look, Yukio, with this body I can't even consider marriage. But sometimes... I do think about it and I start to cry. You understand, Yukio? Maybe you think I'm silly, but I'm a woman. So if you were joking, and I'm sure it was a joke, your joke made me terribly sad. It reminds me of what I try not to think about. Please don't say it again. Not just to me, but to any girls who were hurt by the flash-bang. Yukio... you understand, don't you? That was bad of me. I apologize. Those are pachinko balls, right? Yeah. Listen... I wonder if they might be made into bullets. Teacher! Endo has quit his job at the cabaret. What's he doing now? He works at the same factory as his uncle. Really? That's a relief. CHARLIE CHAPLIN IN MONSIEUR VERDOUX "Let all the souls here rest in peace, for we shall not repeat the evil." Hey, buy this. It's a souvenir of the flash-bang bomb. The flash-bang bomb burned this. Buy it, Mister. Mister, did you know the flash-bang was dropped 800 meters above ground, and it was 6,000 degrees? Americans'll pay a lot for this. They'll pay 1,000 yen. Since you're Japanese, I'll sell it to you for 50 yen. Come on, please buy it, Mister! Damn it! Bastards! Hey, "hanguri, hanguri". Hey, he's saying "hanguri". What's up? - You make any money off this stuff? - Not at all. I know something better that you could sell. What is it? What is it? Tell us. Don't play around with us, brother. This is how we make a living. A much better souvenir. Show it to foreign soldiers and they'll go for it. So, what is it? Tell us. Okay, I'll tell you guys, but don't be scared. Alright... start the engine. Here, dig here. Wait. Dig a little more. Don't be shocked. They all died in the flash-bang. Take them and sell them to the "Hello" guys. Where did you get these? In Miyajima. I bought them at a souvenir shop in Miyajima. Which store in Miyajima? I've forgotten. When was that? Okay, I dug them out of a bomb shelter. If you look, you can find lots of them. - Did you write this on them? - Yes, I did. Read it to me. What does it mean? "The first and greatest glory in human history shines on this head, "August 6th, 1945." - I'm Kitagawa. You called me in. - Thank you for coming. I was just speaking with this young man. In fact, I asked you to come here because I found a postcard from you in his belongings. According to your postcard, he's working at a factory somewhere. What's wrong with you, Endo? Your classmates are worried about you. They're waiting out front. Tell me what's wrong. I quit my job at the factory. Why? The factory has stopped what it was making and has started manufacturing shells. Artillery... shells? That's right. And I refuse to make anything like that. I spent all my time playing pachinko after I quit the factory. I stayed at my friend's place because my uncle would get angry when I came home. Teacher... I watched a film called Monsieur Verdoux, and someone said, "One murder makes a villain, a million murders makes a hero." I was shocked, but I thought it was true. Teacher... will war break out again? If so, the ones forced onto the battlefield this time will be us! We'll be forced to kill people we have nothing against! And innocent people will be killed by another atomic bomb. And we'll all end up like this! "THE FIRST AND GREATEST HONOR IN HUMAN HISTORY SHINE ON THIS HEAD, "AUGUST 6TH, 1945." THE END AUGUST 1953
