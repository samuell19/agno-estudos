HATED SWEATING UNDER MY MAN-BOOBS. I'D JUST BEEN THROUGH AN ARBITRATION, AND I WAS DUE A FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT FOR SOME WORK I'D BEEN STIFFED ON ALMOST A YEAR BEFORE. MY LAWYER SAID, "THEY'LL PAY." IT WAS TAKING FOREVER TO COLLECT. AND I WAS DYING SLOWLY OF STRANGULATION. [CHUCKLES] 85. THAT'S NICE. I HADN'T ACTUALLY, REALLY SLEPT IN ABOUT SIX MONTHS. [SIGHS] I WOULD LATER, WITH MY EYES CLOSED, BUT THAT WASN'T SLEEPING-- IT WAS CHECKING MY EYELIDS FOR CRACKS. I WAS JUST SO TWEAKED ABOUT MONEY. MY DAD. GOD BLESS HIM.

IN THIS WORLD, THERE AREN'T TOO MANY MISTAKES WORSE THAN PUTTING YOUR OWN KID IN THE POSITION OF HAVING TO BE THE PARENT. IT SUCKS PRETTY BAD. FOR MOST OF US, THIS HAPPENS WHEN WE'RE BLISSFULLY DEMENTED IN OUR OLD AGE. I'M JEALOUS OF THOSE PEOPLE. BUT THE DAY WAS YOUNG, AND I STILL HAD WHOLE, NEW HORIZONS OF DICK-HEADEDNESS TO EXPLORE. TO GET THE REST OF THE MONEY, I SAW MY OLD FRIEND JERRY BRAILL. HE WAS THE ONLY GUY I KNEW WHO WASN'T WIPED OUT. JERRY WAS AN OLD SCHOOL COMEDIAN, FROM THE CATSKILLS TO ED SULLIVAN, TO VEGAS, TO HOLLYWOOD, AND THEN LATER, AN ETERNITY IN DINNER THEATER. HE WAS LONG RETIRED, BUT HE'D REALLY BEEN AROUND. THE THING IS, JERRY USED TO BE COURT JESTER TO SOME REALLY NOTORIOUS MOB GUYS. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF THEM ARE STILL AROUND TO ANSWER A CALL. H-HEY! THERE HE IS. HI, JERRY.WHERE THE HELL YOU BEEN? I WAS HALF-EXPECTING A REPORT IN THE NEWS. WHAT? THE NEIGHBORS CALLED, COMPLAINING. THEY FIND YOU WHILE INVESTIGATING THE CADAVEROUS WAFT. THEY FIND YOUR DOG SITTING LIKE HENRY VIII, WITH YOUR DRUMSTICK IN HIS MOUTH. COME ON! WELL, AT LEAST WE KNOW THERE'S NO QUESTION WHERE WE'D FIND YOU. NEVER. MANHATTAN IN THE DESERT. STORY OF MY LIFE. "MANHATTAN IN THE DESERT." OY. SO YOU DISAPPEARED? YEAH, I KNOW. HEY, I-- YOU GOT A MINUTE?YEAH, I'M DONE. SIT. THANKS. YOU MAKE QUITE A STYLISH FIGURE HERE THIS MORNING. HIYA. COFFEE? UH, YEAH, SURE. I'LL HAVE SOME COFFEE. YOU LIKE THAT.WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "WHAT DO I MEAN?" IT'S A SIMPLE QUESTION. YOU GOT DROOL ON YOUR CHIN. YOU MEAN, HER? SHE'S BEEN MY NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION, LIKE, THE LAST TWO YEARS. OKAY? AND I HAVEN'T EVEN SAID HELLO YET. I WANT TO KISS EVERY LAST CENTIMETER OF-- ACTUALLY, WHEN I SAY "KISS," I MEAN LICK. I'M SURE. YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M PRETTY SURE SHE'S SINGLE. SHE DEFINITELY IS. I TRIED. [LAUGHS] YOU OLD DOG. HOW'D SHE TURN YOU DOWN? SHE OPINED THAT THE TIMES HAD NOT YET GOTTEN THAT HARD. TO WHICH I RESPONDED, THAT I HAD. YOU DESERVED IT. SHE HAS A DAUGHTER, YOU KNOW? SO? SO, YOU JUST DON'T INDISCRIMINATELY LICK ON LADIES WHO HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN. READY TO ORDER?UM, YOU KNOW WHAT? IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU, I MIGHT JUST-- JUST HAVE SOME COFFEE. COFFEE IN A COFFEE SHOP. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF. I AM, BELIEVE ME. SO WHAT'S UP? THINGS HAVE GOTTEN A LITTLE TOUGH LATELY, JERRY. HOW MUCH? YOU KNOW, JERRY. IT'S JUST NOT THAT EASY, MAN. YOU'VE BEEN MY OLDEST FRIEND OUT HERE IN THE DESERT. YOU GOT ME MY FIRST JOB. I DON'T WANT TO STEP ALL OVER THAT. IT'S JUST-- I-I CAN'T GET ANYTHING FROM BACK HOME RIGHT NOW, MAN. AND UH... I'M FLYING WITHOUT A NET. I KNOW. THESE ARE TOUGH DAYS. YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS MANAGED TO BE ABLE TO PAY YOU BACK BEFORE. AND I MEAN, I KNOW SOMETIMES IT'S TAKEN A WHILE, BUT... BUT I ALWAYS GOT YOU YOUR MONEY BACK, A-AND YOU MADE SOME, TOO. YOU KNOW? DO I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS? NO. HOW MUCH? UH... WELL, I GOT PART OF IT, SEE, BUT-- BUT BASICALLY IT'S A-- I CAN TURN TWO GRAND INTO SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS AND HAVE ENOUGH TO PAY YOU SOME VIG, AND PAY OFF A BIG PILE OF MY BILLS. NOT ALL OF THEM. BUT I COULD AT LEAST KEEP MY EYEBALLS ABOVE THE FLOOD FOR A WHILE. AND THIS IS SOMETHING I MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO MONTH TO MONTH. WHAT KIND OF VIG? FIVE HUNDRED. FLAT. HOW LONG? TWO, THREE DAYS. TWO DAYS, TO TURN TWO GRAND INTO SIX? I REALLY DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS, DO I? NO. IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT IF I GET DOWN ON MY KNEES AND BEGGED YOU, THAT I COULD GET YOU TO CHANGE YOUR MIND, AND ABANDON WHAT COULD ONLY BE A STUPID FUCKING IDEA?NO. AND ONE THAT'S DEFINITELY GOING TO BLOW UP IN YOUR FACE? I NEED TO DO THIS, JERRY. HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU ALREADY HAVE? 400 DOLLARS. SO YOU NEED 16?SIXTEEN HUNDRED. AND I GET FIVE? YEAH. [SIGHS] JESUS, JERRY. WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' WITH ALL THAT MONEY? YOU JUST ASKED FOR IT. I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D HAVE IT ON YOU. I GOT A COUPLE OF GRAND WALKING AROUND MONEY. COUPLE OF GRAND WALKING-AROUND MONEY? YEAH, WHAT DO YOU WALK AROUND WITH? LIKE TWELVE. TWELVE? IF YOU GOT TWELVE, WHY DO YOU NEED SIXTEEN? I THOUGHT YOU HAD FOUR. NOT TWELVE HUNDRED. TWELVE DOLLARS. LIKE I MIGHT NEED A DIET COKE, OR A TWINKIE. MAYBE A COUPLE GALLONS OF GAS? OH. THAT'S NOT GOOD. NO, THAT'S NOT GOOD, JERRY. THE TWINKIE, I ENJOY. BUT NO, IT'S NOT GOOD. THANKS, JERRY. I'LL BE IN TOUCH. YEAH, UM... HEY, I'LL SEE YOU. BYE, TONY. MY BRILLIANT IDEA WAS SIMPLE: I KNEW WHERE TO SCORE A COUPLE OF OUNCES OF COCAINE. AT LEAST, I THOUGHT IT WAS COKE. IT COULD HAVE BEEN SPEED. BUT HOW SHOULD I KNOW ONE WHITE POWDER FROM ANOTHER? I TASTED IT AT A PARTY A FEW MONTHS EARLIER, AND IT FELT LIKE COKE ON MY GUMS. ANYWAY, WHATEVER IT WAS, I ALSO KNEW A WHOLE POPULATION OF RICH GUYS IN THOSE RESORT COMMUNITIES THAT WERE HAPPY TO SHOVE ANYTHING UP THEIR NOSES FOR GIGGLES. I WAS ABLE TO JUSTIFY THIS PLAN IN MY BATTERED MORALITY, BY FIGURING THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE I'D BE SELLING IT TO WERE GUYS IN THEIR 60s. IT WAS SOMEHOW, TO ME, OKAY TO DEAL COKE IF I COULD BE REASONABLY SURE THAT IT WOULDN'T FALL INTO THE HANDS OF KIDS. THESE FOLKS WERE GOING TO FIND THEIR KICKS FROM SOMEONE ELSE ANYWAY. IT MIGHT AS WELL BE ME SELLING IT TO THEM. IN OTHER WORDS, I WAS A COMPLETE PIECE OF SHIT. I DON'T KNOW WHY THE HELL I PARKED SO FAR AWAY FROM THE HOUSE. I GUESS I FIGURED IF THE PLACE WAS BUSTED WHILE I WAS THERE, I DIDN'T WANT MY CAR TO GET IMPOUNDED. WHAT KIND OF DOUCHEBAG LOGIC IS THAT? [BARKING] I WAS SWEATING MY ASS OFF BY THE TIME I GOT TO THE DOOR. HEY. UH, DOES ART LIVE HERE? - CAN I HELP YOU? - YEAH. IS ART HERE? ART? - ART! - WHAT? DO YOU REMEMBER ME? NO. YEAH, WE MET AT MY FRIEND DON'S HOUSE? AT A PARTY? WE TALKED. - [GLASS BREAKING] - [MOANING INSIDE HOUSE] - SHUT THE FUCK UP! - [MAN] I'M SORRY, MAN! JESUS FUCKING CHRIST! NOT YOU. AND? YOU HAD SOME STUFF? DID I? REGULAR SNOW STORM. [MOTORCYCLE ROARING] CRYSTAL METH. THAT'S DEXTROMETHAMPHETAMINE. WAS IT? SEE, I THOUGHT IT WAS COKE. AND ACTUALLY, I WAS HOPING IT WAS COKE. UH, WHY IS THAT? YOU KNOW, I JUST THINK IT'S A LITTLE MORE UPSCALE. THAN METH. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? IN BOTH MARKETING AND PERCEPTION. I-I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. SEE, COKE IS A SEROTONIN- DOPAMINE REUPTAKE INHIBITOR. IT'S AN ANESTHETIC AND AN APPETITE SUPPRESSANT. IT'S TOTALLY ADDICTIVE, WITHOUT ANY UPSIDE. IT JUST DEADENS AND LEAVES YOU PARANOID. COKE IS FOR ASSHOLES. UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU'RE SOME KIND OF A JUNGLE DUDE, YOU'RE LIVING IN PERU OR COLUMBIA. EATING THE LEAF LIKE NATURE INTENDED, TO TAKE THE STING OUT OF A LIFE AS A PRIMITIVE MAN, LIVING UNDER THE THUMB OF AN OPPRESSIVE REGIME, WHEN ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD IS WATCHING TELEVISION. WE HAVE TELEVISION, DON'T WE?YEAH. SURE DO. I WAS PROBABLY JUST AN ASSHOLE IN THE '90S, HUH? HEY, ART. HEY, YOU GOT A MINUTE? WE COULD TALK FOR A SECOND? [SNIFFS] SMELL THAT. SMELLS GOOD, DOESN'T IT? YEAH. YOU GO WATCH SOME CARTOONS. I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE. WHAT'S UP, BIG GUY? Y'KNOW, I UH. I'M THINKING MAYBE I COULD MOVE SOME OF YOUR PRODUCT. ALL RIGHT? YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE METH? I MEAN, MAYBE, YOU KNOW, NOT A LOT, BUT LIKE AN OUNCE OR TWO A MONTH? SEE, I RUN ALL THE MEDIA AND MARKETING FOR ALL THE BIG RESORTS. SO I GOT A CLIENTELE THAT CAN AFFORD A COUPLE BAD HABITS. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? WELL, METH IS A VERY DEMOCRATIC STIMULANT, YOU KNOW? AND ANY MOTHER'S SON CAN AFFORD IT. YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO TELL ME YOU DON'T WANT TO INCREASE YOUR CLIENT BASE, ARE YOU? LOOK, YOU CAN USE ALL THOSE FAGGOTY MARKETING WORDS YOU WANT, BUT YOU'RE STILL ASKING TO BE A DEALER HERE. YOU UP FOR THAT, BIG GUY? IT'S NOT EXACTLY MY FIRST CAREER CHOICE, BUT I GOTTA DO SOMETHING NOW. WELL SEE, THAT'S A PROBLEM. BECAUSE IT IS MY CAREER AND I'M VERY GOOD AT IT. I MIX UP A MIGHTY TASTY TEA FROM PHARMACEUTICAL GRADE PSEUDOEPHEDRINE, AND I SELL IT FOR A PROFIT. I PROVIDE THE TWEAKERS OF THIS WORLD WITH A VALUABLE SERVICE. NOW, THREE THINGS: A GOOD DRUG DEALER DOESN'T GET CAUGHT. HE DOESN'T HAVE HIS TWEAKERS DROPPIN' DEAD ON HIM. AND HE NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER... GETS PUT IN A POSITION TO HAVE SOMEBODY KILLED. AND I HATE IT WHEN SOME STUPID FUCKIN' MOTHERFUCKER COMES ALONG TO SPOIL IT FOR ME-- YOU GOT IT? YEAH. YEAH, I GET IT. BUT I THINK WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE. SEE, I WANT TO KEEP THIS AWAY FROM THE KIDS. MY CLIENTELE? THEY'RE MORE MATURE. OH, WELL. OH GOD, I FEEL BETTER. THANK YOU! ALL RIGHT, COOL, MAN. ALL RIGHT, THEN WE CAN DO BUSINESS, HUH? [LAUGHS] JESUS-- ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND? WHAT'S THE PROBLEM, MAN? HEY, LET ME JUST TELL YOU SOMETHING, IN CASE YOU'RE WORRIED. I'M NOT A COP. [LAUGHS HARDER] HEY! HEY, I GOT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS, RIGHT HERE. GIMME THAT. SIXTEEN HUNDRED IN HUNDREDS, 400 IN TWENTIES. COUNT IT, MAN! COUNT IT! WHAT? THE MONEY. WHAT MONEY?THE MONEY I JUST HANDED YOU! INSIDE OVER HERE, I GOT A YOUNG TWEAKER WHO'S ALREADY GIVEN ME ALL HIS WORLDLY POSSESSIONS, AND HE CAN'T AFFORD ANY MORE CRYSTAL. NOW, IN A MINUTE, I'M GOING TO WALK IN THERE, AND I'M GONNA TELL HIM THAT IF HE WANTS A SNOOTFUL, HE'LL COME OUT HERE WITH A BOX CUTTER AND HE'LL CARVE YOUR FUCKING FACE UP INTO A DOILY. NOW YOU BETTER FUCKIN' GET OUTTA HERE! ALAN! BRIAN! I WAS BEGINNING TO SUSPECT THAT SOMETHING HAD GONE TERRIBLY WRONG. BUT I JUST STOOD THERE. I DIDN'T KNOW IF HE WAS KIDDING, AND HE'D BRING ME OUT MY GRAMS, OR WAS IT LIKE A TEST OF SOME KIND, LIKE, HE LIKE-- THIS GUY WOULDN'T DO BUSINESS WITH SOMEBODY UNLESS HE HAD THE GUTS FOR IT? OR, IF HE JUST STOLE MY MONEY. I MEAN, DID HE THINK I'D STAND FOR THAT? AND THEN IT HIT ME, MORON THAT I AM, THAT I COULDN'T VERY WELL GO TO THE COPS AND COMPLAIN THAT THE BIG BAD METH MANUFACTURER HAD STOLEN THE MONEY I'D BORROWED AT LOAN SHARK RATES TO SCORE WHITE POWDER FOR DISTRIBUTION! SOMEHOW, I DIDN'T THINK THAT STORY WOULD GENERATE MUCH SYMPATHY FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT. [ART] BRIAN! GET A SHOVEL AND DIG A HOLE! WE'RE ROASTIN' A FUCKING PIG. BRIAN! GODDAMN IT, ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME? [NATIVE AMERICAN CHANTING] [VOMITING] ICE CREAM AND PEANUT BUTTER. AND VODKA. [CRYING] YOU STUPID SON OF A BITCH! WHAT THE FUCK? FUCK! YOU LOSER! LOSER! WHAT'D I DO? WHAT DID I DO WRONG? HUH? WHY? YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST STRANGE. AFTER A WHILE, YOU KINDA WANT TO HIT BOTTOM. YOU JUST-- YOU JUST WANT TO GET IT OVER WITH. YOU GET, I DON'T KNOW, KIND OF BORED. OF, UH, PLUMMETING. PLUMMETING CAN BE A DRAG AFTER A WHILE. FUCK. WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO YOU? AND YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE GOING TO PAY THE ELECTRICITY. NO. AW, SHIT! THAT LADY ON THE LINE TOLD ME I HAD THREE DAYS TO PAY THE BILL, I THINK, YESTERDAY. MAYBE MONDAY. AW... WHY DIDN'T YOU PAY IT?I CAN'T SAY. EXCEPT I GAVE YOU ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY IT. YEAH. I LOST IT, MIKE. YOU WHAT? I LOST IT ALL.WAIT, WAIT A SECOND. WAIT. HOW? HOW DID YOU LOSE THE MONEY? I CAN'T SAY.ARE YOU KIDDING ME?. DAD, THAT'S SO FUCKING MESSED UP. OKAY? YOU NEED-- YOU NEED TO GET SOME HELP!I KNOW. NO, YOU NEED TO GET HELP!I KNOW, MIKE. I ASKED THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHO WOULD HELP ME TO HELP ME TODAY, AND THEY DID! AND YOU KNOW, I STILL SCREWED IT UP. JESUS CHRIST, MAN! OKAY, YOU NEED TO STOP DRINKING. THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. YOU NEED TO GO BACK TO AA. I'M NOT GOING BACK TO AA! I GOT ENOUGH TWO WEEK AND FOUR WEEK CHIPS TO START A POKER GAME, FOR CHRISSAKES! I GOT TO DO THIS MYSELF. USUALLY I CAN. WHEN THINGS ARE NOT SO FROZEN. BUT RIGHT NOW? NOTHING'S WORKING, MAN. YOU KNOW? AND THOSE GUYS AT AA? COME ON. THEY HAVEN'T HAD A DRINK IN 20 YEARS AND THEY'RE STILL BLAMING THEIR SHIT ON ALCOHOL. THEY GO TO THOSE MEETINGS JUST TO-- JUST TO-- THEY GO TO THE MEETINGS TO STOP FUCKING DRINKING! THAT'S WHY THEY GO, NOT TO DO ANYTHING ELSE. AND I DON'T FUCKING KNOW ANYMORE! AND YOU'RE TOO MUCH OF A FUCKING COWARD TO ADMIT THAT YOU HAVE AN ISSUE. BUT GUESS WHAT, MAN, I'M NOT FUCKING DEALING WITH IT ANYMORE. THAT'S ALL. I'M FUCKING OUTTA HERE, OKAY? NO. NO, MIKE--I'M FUCKING OUTTA HERE! DO NOT FUCKING TOUCH ME! MIKE! MIKE! I WAS TIRED. I MEAN, RUNNING AWAY FROM THE RANCH WAS MORE EXERCISE THAN I HAD IN TEN YEARS. I HONESTLY HAD A HARD TIME LIFTING MY FEET TO TAKE A SINGLE STEP. AND I COULDN'T IMAGINE FEELING ANY WORSE IN MY CONSCIENCE. BUT AGAIN, AIMING AT GETTING IT ALL OVER WITH, I WENT TO FINISH IT. I FELT COMPELLED TO FACE IT, EVEN THOUGH MY WHOLE LIFE HAD TRAINED ME TO RUN AWAY. SO? SO, IT WAS JUST LIKE YOU SAID. I LOST IT ALL. I GOT ROBBED. YEAH. HOW IT HAPPENED DOESN'T MATTER. MARIA? SI? WHISKEY, POR FAVOR. SI,JERRY. JERRY-- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? CHRIST'S SAKE, THIS IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU-- I WENT OUT TO THIS PLACE, AND THESE GUYS ALMOST-- NO, TONY, NOT TODAY, NOT IN THE LAST 6 HOURS, YOU FUCKIN' IDIOT. I'M TALKING ABOUT IN YOUR LIFE! WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO YOU? I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE MONEY-- THOUGH DON'T KID YOURSELF, YOU OWE ME 2100, AND YOU'RE GOING TO PAY EVERY CENT, OR YOU'LL WORK IT OFF FOR ME, AS I DECIDE-- WITHOUT FAIL. JUST UNDERSTAND THAT MUCH. BECAUSE I CAN'T CALL A COUPLE OF GUYS WITH BENT NOSES TO COME AND COLLECT FROM A-- I WON'T SAY LIKE A SON, MORE LIKE AN IDIOT NEPHEW! YOU'LL PAY IT OFF BY DOING EXACTLY WHAT I TELL YOU TO DO. I WILL. I WILL. SOLAMENTE UNO TAZO, QUERIDA. THIS IDIOT ISN'T DRINKING. JERRY, I'M SORRY.YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, IT-- IT JUST CREPT UP ON ME OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS, AND THEN ALL OF SUDDEN I WAS JUST SO BROKE-- NO, MAN, YOU'RE NOT LISTENING, AND YOU'RE PISSING ME OFF! I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT RECENTLY, OR EVEN A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN STACY LEFT. I'M TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU HAD A SHOT. BECAUSE I REMEMBER YOU HAD A SHOT. YEAH! BACK IN HOLLYWOOD. YOU HAD A LITTLE HEAT. YOU COULDA GONE UP, BUT INSTEAD YOU WENT DOWN, AND YOU'VE BEEN BUMPING ALONG THE BOTTOM EVER SINCE. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. I'LL TAKE 200 DOLLARS OFF YOUR TAB IF YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH. THE TRUTH. YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT. THE TRUTH DOESN'T HAVE TO BE MANUFACTURED. IT JUST IS. YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T ALL HAVE STORIED CAREERS, JERRY. [CHUCKLES, SNORTS] I DON'T SEE YOU OUT THERE SETTING THE WORLD ON FIRE. DON'T DEFLECT, PISHER. I HAD MY DAY. I'M 72 YEARS OLD, AND I MADE MINE BY WORKING MY ASS OFF. I DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING--FOR OVER HALF CENTURY, EVERYWHERE I WENT, IT WAS A YUKFEST! I MADE PRESIDENTS PISH IN THEIR PANTS, AND WORKED IN THE WORST BARROOM DIVES IMAGINABLE, SWEATING LIKE A DITCH DIGGER TO MAKE A COUPLE OF AFTERNOON ALKIES CHUCKLE. SO DON'T TURN THIS AROUND ON MY SUCCESS. I KNOW WHO I AM, AND WHO I WAS. WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? I DIDN'T MEAN--I WANT THE TRUTH! THE TRUTH?YEAH. REMEMBER WHAT THAT IS? YOU MEAN LIKE, DO I KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE A CONCEPT, OR DO I ACTUALLY KNOW THE TRUTH IN THIS CASE? BOTH, TONY. BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS A LITTLE TOO PLIABLE WITH YOU. YOU'RE TOO WILLING TO BELIEVE THAT A LINE OF BULLSHIT'S THE TRUTH, LIKE THAT STUPID FUCKING THING YOU DID TODAY WITH MY MONEY. YOU BELIEVED THAT YOU COULD DO THINGS A CERTAIN WAY, AND YOU COULDN'T. YOU ACTUALLY CAN BULLSHIT YOURSELF, AND THAT'S THE MOST DANGEROUS KIND OF LIAR THERE IS. 'CAUSE IF YOU BELIEVE YOUR CRAP, IT COMES OFF REASONABLE TO AN OTHERWISE SKEPTICAL AUDIENCE. YOU NEED TO SAY THE TRUTH. I KNOW HOW TO TELL THE TRUTH. BUT WHAT'S THAT WORTH TO ME? 200 BUCKS, HUH? 200 BUCKS TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH? ISN'T THAT KINDA CHEAP? NOT TO ME. I THINK THE TRUTH SHOULD BE FREE. OH, SHIT. TAKE YOUR TIME. SHIT. SHIT. [CHUCKLE, SNORT] WOW. WELL-- IT'S BEEN LIKE, A LONG TIME. IT'S LIKE 18-- NO. MIKE'S 19. SO 20 YEARS AGO. WHAT WAS? REMEMBER THAT-- THAT UH, VIDEO PROMO SHOOT I DID FOR BOBBY DARIN? FOR THE FILM PROJECT? I SAW THE TAPE. YEAH, WELL, THAT WAS LIKE, RIGHT BEFORE STACY AND I CAME OUT HERE. RIGHT BEFORE MIKE WAS BORN. RIGHT. WELL, I PUT THAT PROJECT TOGETHER WITH SOME CASH FROM A FEW DIFFERENT PLACES. YOU KNOW, MY DAD GAVE ME SOME MONEY. AND UH, THIS GUY I WAS WORKING FOR AT THE TIME, HE INVESTED TOO. YOU REMEMBER JOE ROSS? NO. WELL, I WASN'T GETTING CAST MUCH ANYMORE, SO I HAD TO TAKE A JOB AT A PRODUCTION COMPANY IN CULVER CITY. YOU REMEMBER THAT? MM-HMMM. WELL, JOE ROSS OWNED THAT STUDIO. WE SHOT THE VIDEO AT THE STUDIO, AND JOE HAD GIVEN ME SOME CASH AS WELL. BUT THEN, AFTER THE SHOOT, THERE WAS A PARTY AT THIS GUY'S ARTIST'S LOFT DOWNTOWN, WHERE YOU KNOW, CREW MEMBERS, MONEY GUYS AND WANNABEES. I GUESS I WAS ONE OF THEM. WE WERE TRYING TO SCHMOOZE THE INVESTORS TO LAUNCH THE MOVIE PRODUCTION. YOU WERE REALLY GREAT. I'LL BE RIGHT OVER HERE. NOW, JOE ROSS WAS A STRANGE GUY. HE ALWAYS DID BUSINESS WITH HIS MOTHER, AND SHE WAS HIS RIGHT HAND. SHE HANDLED HIM, AND I MEAN, THIS WAS A TOUGH LADY. AND HIS SON WAS ALWAYS THERE, TOO, BUT I NEVER KNEW WHAT HE DID IN TERMS OF RUNNING THE STUDIO. NO, SORRY, GUY. WHAT? AND THEY WOULD ALL OF THEM REFER TO THE FATHER OF THE FAMILY. I NEVER MET THE GUY, BUT HE WORKED IN PART OF THE FAMILY BUSINESS. HE WORKED OUT OF SANTA FE. YOU WANT TO GET A PIECE OF ME? COME ON OVER HERE! I'M GONNA RIP YOUR FUCKIN' HEAD OFF! JOE, HE WAS INTENSE. HE COULD BE TEMPERAMENTAL. HE NEVER YELLED AT ME-- I MEAN, HE DID, BUT NEVER THAT BAD. [SIGHS HEAVILY] BUT I'D HEARD HIM SCREAMING INTO THE PHONE BEFORE. AND I KNEW HE OWNED A GUN. BUT HE'D BEEN GOOD TO ME, SO I DIDN'T QUESTION HIS MOTIVES TOO MUCH. SO THE NIGHT OF THE SHOOT, I GOT TO THE PARTY, AND EVERYBODY MADE A TOAST "TO BOBBY DARIN!" AND WE ALL CLINKED GLASSES. SO IT WAS JUST LIKE TWO WEEKS AFTER WE SHOT THAT PROMO... JOE ROSS GOT KILLED. IN SOME AMBUSH WITH GUNFIRE ON HIS WAY TO LUNCH. WAIT A MINUTE. I REMEMBER THAT. IN THE SAME HOUR, HIS FATHER WAS ASSASSINATED TOO, IN SANTA FE, NEW MEXICO. YEAH! PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT IN TOWN. YEAH. THEY OBVIOUSLY PISSED OFF THE WRONG FUCKING PEOPLE. JESUS. SIMULTANEOUS, IN TWO CITIES? YEAH. THE GUY HAD TAKEN SOME INVESTMENT MONEY FOR A MOVIE THAT NEVER GOT MADE, RIGHT? YOU KNOW, I NEVER KNEW WHAT HIS BUSINESS WAS. I MEAN, ALL I KNOW IS, HE HAD CASH. AND YOU GOT SPOOKED, PULLED UP YOUR ROOTS IN L.A., AND CAME OUT TO PALM SPRINGS? YEAH. THAT'S IT. HMM. HMM! I DON'T BUY IT. [STAMMERING] WHAT DO YOU MEAN, MAN? THAT'S THE TRUTH. THAT'S SOME PRETTY CRAZY SHIT! I KNOW IT IS. BUT THERE'S MORE. SOME DISHONEST PEOPLE GOT MURDERED. YOU HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR DISHONESTY, RIGHT? NO, NOTHING. YEAH. WELL, I COULD SEE HOW YOU'D FREAK OUT, AND-- BUT RUN AWAY FROM YOUR LIFE, FOREVER, AMEN? I DON'T THINK SO. TRUTH. I WAS GONNA BE IN THE CAR WITH THE ROSSES THAT DAY. I WENT TO LUNCH WITH THEM EVERY DAY. BUT WE WERE GOING OVER ACCOUNTS. UH, I DIDN'T GO. SOMETHING HAPPENED. TELL ME. AT THE PARTY, I WAS INTRODUCED TO A GUY NAMED SAL. SALVATORE SOMETHING-OR-OTHER. HE WAS ONE OF THE MONEY GUYS, OR A BUSINESS ASSOCIATE OF SOME KIND, BUT I NEVER SPOKE TO HIM PERSONALLY. I MEAN, I NEVER GOT TO KNOW THE GUY. SO I WAS WORKING THAT MORNING, AND ON MY WAY BACK TO THE OFFICE FROM ONE OF SOUNDSTAGES... THAT I NOTICED A COUPLE OF GUYS TALKING DOWN AN ALLEY BY THE DUMPSTER. AND THEY WERE IN A PRETTY HEATED DISCUSSION. AND THEN I SAW THAT ONE OF THEM WAS THIS GUY SAL. SO I STARTED TOWARD THEM, FIGURING I MIGHT BE ABLE TO PLUG THE DARIN PROJECT AGAIN. AND BEFORE THEY KNEW I WAS THERE, I HEARD THE ONE GUY SAY, "NO, IT'S GOTTA BE DONE TODAY." AND THEN SAL SAYS, "I DON'T MIND WHACKING THE MOTHERFUCKER, BUT I WANNA GET SOME OF THE MONEY BACK." AND THE OTHER GUY SAYS, "NO, THE BOSS SAYS NOW. HE'S TIRED OF WAITING." I JUST BACKED AWAY AND WENT INSIDE. SO I WENT UPSTAIRS TO THE OFFICE, AND I INTENDED TO SAY SOMETHING TO JOE, TO WARN HIM. AND HE TURNS TO ME, AND HE INVITES ME OUT TO LUNCH AGAIN WITH HIM AND THE FAMILY. AND WE JUST LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR A MOMENT UNTIL I SAID, "NO THANKS, I GOT A CLIENT COMING IN FOR A TOUR." I CHOKED. I COULDN'T SAY ANYTHING. I WAS AFRAID THOSE GUYS MIGHT HAVE SEEN ME. THEN THEY'D BLAME ME IF THEY MISSED THEIR CHANCE, OR LIKE I WAS TRYING TO PROTECT JOE, AND THAT WOULD MAKE ME A PROBLEM. STACY HAD JUST GOTTEN PREGNANT AT THE TIME, AND I WAS JUST FROZEN BY FEAR. AND, JOE, HE JUST SMILED AT ME, AND THE WHOLE FAMILY FILED OUT FOR LUNCH. IT'S ABOUT TWO MINUTES LATER, AND WE'RE SITTING IN THE OFFICE, TALKING. I ACTUALLY HEARD THE GUNFIRE. [GUNSHOTS ECHOING] WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? I RAN DOWN, AND THERE THEY WERE! AND YEAH, I WAS SCARED. I WAS SCARED THAT SOMEONE-- THE COPS, THE MOB GUYS, SOMEBODY CLOSE TO JOE'S FAMILY. SOMEBODY WAS GOING TO CALL ME INTO QUESTION, AND I JUST COULDN'T RISK THAT. AND THAT'S THE TRUTH. RIGHT. AND YOU NEVER WENT BACK? I THOUGHT ABOUT IT, I MEAN, LIKE A MILLION TIMES, BUT THEN WE CAME OUT HERE. WE HAD MIKE. AND THEN I GOT ALL THAT WORK, THANKS TO YOU, PRODUCING ALL THOSE LOCAL COMMERCIALS. AND THEN WE GOT THE HOUSE... AND WHEN EVERYTHING STARTED TO SLOW DOWN, BELIEVE ME, I THOUGHT ABOUT GOING BACK, BUT IT WAS ALREADY TOO LATE, MAN. WHO'S GONNA REMEMBER ME? AND LOOK AT ALL THE WEIGHT I PUT ON. WHAT WAS I GONNA DO? I COULDN'T HIT THE AUDITION TRAIL LOOKING LIKE THIS. CHASING ALL THE OLD JOHN CANDY AND CHRIS FARLEY ROLES? OH, COME ON. YOU'RE NOT NEARLY AS FUNNY AS JOHN CANDY AND CHRIS FARLEY. WELL, I'M NOT AS FAT EITHER. NO, YOU'RE NOT. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? WHAT? I THINK THAT THAT'S A LOAD OF SHIT! IT'S THE TRUTH. I KNOW IT IS! BUT IT'S STILL A LOAD OF SHIT. KID, YOU CAN'T LIVE ALL YOUR LIFE A LOSER JUST BECAUSE OF TEN MINUTES OF DIRTY ACTION BACK IN THE 90s! THAT SHIT IS HISTORY NOW. FORGET IT. AND DO WHAT YOU WANT WITH YOUR LIFE. YOU GOT NO EXCUSES ANYMORE. NO EXCUSES, JERRY? I'M FINISHED. THERE'S NO PLACE LOWER THAN WHERE I AM NOW. SO WHAT DO YOU GOT TO LOSE? LISTEN, PUTZ. NOBODY GIVES A SHIT ABOUT ACT ONE. PEOPLE WALK OUT REMEMBERING THE END. THEY REMEMBER THE ENCORE. IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ASKED FOR AN ENCORE. THAT'S YOUR CHANCE: TO SEND THEM OUT COMPLETELY ELATED. SO HERE IT IS. I'M TELLING YOU, THERE'S NOT A REAL PERFORMER ON THE PLANET THAT CAN IGNORE THIS CALL. COME ON. LET'S GO. WHERE? COME ON! COME ON, LET'S GO. JERRY, I CAN'T. I WAS COMPLETELY FUCKED TODAY. I CAN'T GO ANYWHERE. I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE. WAIT A MINUTE. DID I JUST HAVE A STROKE? DID I BLOW OUT MY SHORT-TERM MEMORY? I THOUGHT I WAS TALKING TO TONY DURAN, WHO OWES ME A COUPLE THOUSAND DOLLARS. WAIT A SEC-- I GOT 200 OFF FOR TELLING THE TRUTH! OKAY, 19 HUNDRED. OKAY? I'LL CREDIT YOU ANOTHER HUNDRED IF YOU DO THIS.
