I thought nothing could change the way we felt about each other. I thought we were invincible. Someone once said, "If you want something very badly, set it free." "If it comes back to you, it's yours for ever." "If it doesn't, it was never yours to begin with." I knew one thing. I was David's to begin with. And he was mine. Light up my life... We met in high school. David was a senior and I was a freshman. After glee club, he'd drive me and my best friend home from school. I used to watch him in the rear-view mirror. I fell in love with his eyes. When I was 19 David proposed to me on the pier at Paradise Cove. Our parents were against it. They said we were too young, we didn't know each other. But David said that a life without risk is like no life at all. So we eloped. I graduated from architecture school and got a job at a small firm. Diana helped support us by selling real estate. I spent all my free time working on a design of my own. It summed up everything about architecture that really mattered. It was my dream house. D? Have I ever told you I love you? No. - I do. - Still? Always. We had our differences. He'd take his clothes off and leave them on the floor. It made me crazy. What do you think this is? Leaving your shoes on the table? I don't need to do your laundry. I will pick it up. Don't get violent. What about this? Now, you put that down. You're going to hurt somebody. I am going to hurt somebody? You're out of your mind! OK, now. Fine. Goddamn it! Now, come on. Let's just relax. Did I hurt you? No. I am all right. I am sorry. Really? You were kidding? D, your pants are on fire. You have no idea. We had no money, so for entertainment David showed me architecture he liked. But sometimes I'd have to ask, "Why are we looking at a stupid car wash?" And he'd just say, "No, not stupid." "Don't just use your eyes." He made me look at things differently. David, this is a steal. It just came in. Nobody knows about it yet. It's beautiful. Build a house here. You'd make a name for yourself, because the house will be brilliant, being by David Murphy. I found an incredible piece of property in Santa Monica, by the ocean. It was the perfect site for David's house. We will borrow the money. These leverage stockbroker buyout guys, you should see the junk they buy. They would go crazy for a house of yours. It was brilliant, even though I didn't understand a word of it. We had to economise for the loan payments, but it was our future and I got to build my house. And then the recession hit. The real-estate market dried up. I hadn't closed a sale in six months. Construction fell to its lowest point in years. People were being laid off everywhere, and I was one of them. I feel really bad about this. I don't understand. What happened? The bank has called in the demand note. Can they do that? You don't have any income right now, so they could attach your assets. What assets? Your house. got to keep up those payments. I am sorry. David, I am scared. We don't have any money. What are we going to do? I will wait tables or drive a cab or something. I don't know. I will take care of you. Make it go away. I was desperate. We stood to lose everything: The house I'd been building, even our own home. I swallowed my pride and borrowed $5,000 from my father. It wasn't enough. We needed $50,000. - D... - What? - Get up. Get dressed. I got an idea. - What time is it? Hi! How you doing? - Oh, yeah! - Oh, my God! Oh, honey! That's the spirit! Keep them coming! 50,000 of them, that's what we want! We're winners! Put some money in the kitty! We got a shooter now, folks. A lucky lady shooter. Stack it, don't rack it. And I have a lovely... Why don't you put it on? It suits you. Well, I can't afford it. - That's too bad. - Yeah. I really think you ought to have the dress. Let me buy it for you. You want to buy me this dress? Yeah. - Why? - I have enjoyed watching you. You have earned it. No, I haven't. The dress is for sale. I am not. Roll them now, girlfriend! I can't lose. I am up over $9,000. $9,000 up! This is my wife D. These are my girls. They're going to be moving in. Kiss them. - Yeah. - Bets, please. - Did I ever tell you I love you? - No. - I do. - Still? Always. 5,000. This little pile here, you guessed it. Five more, D. What do you think this is? Five more. Play with it. Roll around with it. Enjoy yourself. Oh, my! And the grand total is... ...$25,040. So we're halfway there, like in an hour. I figure about two hours tomorrow, we will be home free. Come here. What? I love you. I know that. No, I mean even without the money. Last call for wagers. No more bets. Come on, black, come on. Here we go. Yes! No more bets, please. Yes, we won! $4,100. We said we wouldn't go below $5,000. Do you want any more coffee? No, thank you. Tails we quit. Heads we go for it. Two out of three. Last call for wagers. No more bets. OK. I am feeling lucky. I say we put it on red. All of it. Red. I feel red. Do you feel red, D? We can do this, huh? I am going to put it on. I am putting it on red. OK. No, it's black. What are you doing? - It's black. - What are you doing? No, it's red. Go with your instinct. Right? - No more bets. - Come on, man. got to get it. OK, come on red, come on red. Too late, young lady. Place your bets. Bank side, player side. All set? Cards, please. Turning for the players. Passes to the right, please. Player draws nothing. And set. Player side, banker side. - Who's that guy? - That's John Gage. He's a damn billionaire. That's a rich son of a bitch right there. He's down over a million dollars already. You see them little gold things he's playing with? $10,000 apiece. Every time he lays one down, 10,000 big ones. Look how cool he is. He must get more pussy than you can shake a stick at. I am sorry. I didn't mean to offend you. Player wins. It's about time. - You all married? - Yeah. Stick around and gamble a little. Excuse me! Excuse me. Would you mind lending me your wife? Is that your wife? Excuse me? - For luck. - Well, you'd have to ask her. - May I? - Go for it. I don't think it's a good idea. We should go. - Just for a moment? - I will go. Go ahead. It might be fun. What have we got to lose? - Well? - Go and see what happens. Yeah, go ahead. We will be here, backing you up. Thank you. See if you can get a little of that money from him. Do you think she will ever come back? I am just bullshitting you. Have a seat. I have been losing all day long. Then you appeared and I won my first hand. You brought me luck. I'd say that's a sign. Wouldn't you? Would you like a drink? No, thank you. Candy? Place your bets. 100,000. Just like that? Just like that. - Not like that. - Sorry. All bets set? Cards, please. Turning for the players. Now, what we want... What we need... is a nine. We don't like that. Player draws nothing. Cards for the bank, please. Bank's the winner with a natural eight. Pay the bank. I guess I am not so lucky after all. - Do you like cards? - Not especially. Wish I'd asked you sooner. Dice? Yeah, I guess. - Sam. - Mr. G? One. Excuse me, Mr. G. Maybe I should go. This shouldn't take too long. - What? - This. Now... I hope you find this interesting. Pit. Tadross. Yes, sir. It's here now. Goes for one million dollars. It's a bet. Here you are, Mr. G. One million dollars. Bet it all. Coming out. Crap eleven or any seven this time. It is a come-out roll. How much goes, now? Get them down. Pick two. Now just throw a seven. If you want to throw an eleven, that's all right too. Aren't you forgetting something? Winner! Think I ought to quit now? I think I should. Credit my account. Sweetie, that was incredible. Unbelievable. Hi. John Gage. - Hi. David Murphy. - Hi, David. Congratulations. This is my wife Diana. I guess you met. - Hi. Diana? - Diana. Thank you both. Very generous of you, David. Are you staying at the hotel? No. Actually we're just leaving. Yes, we're on our way out. No, don't do that. We got to celebrate. Let me arrange a room for you here. - That's very nice, but... - No, I insist. Please. It's the least I can do. OK? Really, just sign for it. Anything you want. There's some lovely shops off the lobby. Have you seen them? Let's go. How about that? Wow. D, what do you think? Godfather? You won a million dollars today. - He won it. - Honey, you won it for him. This feels nice. Don't get it. Just stay right here. OK. ? P@rM!NdeR M@nk?? ? ? P@rM!NdeR M@nk?? ? ? P@rM!NdeR M@nk?? ? ? P@rM!NdeR M@nk?? ? ? P@rM!NdeR M@nk?? ? ? P@rM!NdeR M@nk?? ? ?

From John Gage. Well, thank him for us. I will do that. Mr. Gage is hosting a gathering tonight in his suite at nine. If you can find the time in your schedule, he'd be most pleased. - Look what you got. - What? Gift from Gage. Really? Well, open it up. That's $5,000. How do you know that? I saw it in the store downstairs. - Lucky for him you like black. - Yeah. No past, no future. Just check in to a hotel and start all over again. I just stick them under the sheets... That's strange, am I right? - In another life, have a good time. - Thanks. Who is that guy Shackleford? Someone who works for me. Someone I trust. He killed someone once. Tell me, where do you see yourself in, say, ten years? Well, I wouldn't mind being a billionaire like yourself. Nice shot. I mean beyond money. What would satisfy you completely, let you sleep well? Are you saying you're not satisfied? Who is? I am. She mean it? I hope so. Well then, you may not have won in Vegas, but you're a lucky man. I got money, I got security, I have businesses, but you have something that I just don't have. I guess there's limits to what money can buy. Not many. Well, some things aren't for sale. Such as? Well, you can't buy people. That's naive, Diana. I buy people every day. In business, maybe, but not when real emotions are involved. What are you saying? You can't buy love? Isn't that a clich?? - It's absolutely true. - Is it? What do you think? - I agree with Diana. - You do? Well, let's test the clich?. Suppose I were to offer you one million dollars... ...for one night with your wife? I'd assume you're kidding. Let's pretend I am not. What would you say? He'd tell you to go to hell. I didn't hear him. I'd tell you to go to hell. That's a reflex answer because your view it as hypothetical. But let's say that there were real money behind it. I am not kidding. A million dollars. The night would pass, but the money could last a lifetime. Think of it. A million dollars. A lifetime of security, for one night. And don't answer right away, but consider it. Seriously. We're positive, OK? Then you have answered my question. And you have proved your point. There are limits to what money can buy. It's late and I hate to admit it, but I have a meeting. May I have one dance? Of course, with your permission. I think you'd better get on to that meeting. You don't want to miss out on your next billion. Understood. I wouldn't part with her either. Goodnight. Can't sleep? No. Me neither. I just keep thinking about it. It's so weird, isn't it? Yeah. David, I think you want me to do it. What are you talking about? Don't be ridiculous. Maybe we should just talk about it. Well, I don't want you to do it. - But you'd let me do it. - No. Why? Do you want to do it? No. But I would. I'd do it for you. For me? I can't believe we're even talking about this. Think about what this money could do for us, what it could do for our future. You could finish your house. You could pay your dad back. Get rid of our debts. After all, it wouldn't mean anything. It's just my body. It's not my mind. It's not my heart. You think we could do something like that? We both slept with other people before we were married, right? Yeah. So we just have to look at it like that. I slept with Bubba Aruzio! If I can do that, I can sleep with anyone. You slept with Bubba? You knew. No, I didn't know that. When? When you were off sleeping with that slut Olivia Daigle. Olivia Deagle. And she wasn't a slut. Excuse me. Olivia Beagle. I do love you. - She wasn't a slut. - Yes, she was. No, she wasn't... ...unfortunately! Thank God we can laugh about it. Yeah. That's easy to say now. After... We just have to forget it ever happened. And never discuss it. Not even once. Because nothing will have happened. Nothing that matters, anyway. We have a brilliant script. Very special. It's a comeback vehicle for Diana Ross. And Billy Ray Cyrus. Kind of "A Star is Born"... So your first screenplay sold for half a million. Should have been two. Except our lawyer caved in on us. That won't happen again. We're going to get a lawyer that's tough. Someone that will step on his grandmother for us. Mr. Green. A David Murphy wants to speak to you urgently. Put him on the speaker. This is an old college buddy. It will only take a second. Jeremy? Davey, I am in a meeting. What's up? Listen, we need you to close a deal. What kind of deal? A very big deal. Big deal. Go on. We're in Vegas at the Hilton. We met John Gage. You know who he is? Sure I know who he is. He's a billionaire. And a major poon hound. He is? Go on. He offered us a million dollars. A million dollars? For what? Your kidneys? For one night with Diana. What do you mean? One night? Like... Yes. Could you excuse me for a second? Let me get this straight. He offered you a million dollars for a night with your wife? Your wife Diana? And you agreed? I don't know what to say. How could you do that? How could you negotiate without me? Never negotiate without your lawyer! For a woman like Diana, I could have gotten you at least two million! Obviously! You don't want to get screwed and then screwed! Stay, please. This is damage control. Two seconds. Eat cookies. No. We have heard enough. You're hired. You're our man. We love your style. Gladys, check the gentlemen's schedules. Call me next week. - Great. - See you then. - Thanks for coming. - No. Thank you. OK, David, before we go any further, let's get the moral issue out of the way. Leave that to us. No, I was referring to my fee. I get 5%. Would you elaborate on the verification clause? Verification. That means you pay, even if the relationship isn't consummated. You mean if I am impotent. It's important for a lawyer to cover contingencies. I can live with that. The "John Garfield clause"? That's if you die in the act. I have no problem with that either. Can I have your pen? - You're pretty good, you know? - Thank you. You should come work for me. We have a deal. A million dollars will be deposited in your casino account in the morning. So... So... So... You can go. Gentlemen, I think it's time for men of good will to take leave of one another. It's all right. I don't bite. So... What, should I go undress? Cheer up. Find a more creative way to think about this, OK? Just look at it like an episode of "The Dating Game" that went a bit awry. - It's going to be OK... - Ladies and gentlemen. Me wish to welcome you to our jamboree. I couldn't believe it. I know we could have gotten two million. Here's your Buddha. Davey, no point getting out the crying towel. You have got a million bucks, buddy. A million bucks! She's an amazing woman. She really is. Couldn't have gotten 500 for my girlfriend. Not that I'd do that... But it's OK that you did. This is a different situation. And she agreed to it, you got to remember that. And it's not like it's hard duty or anything. Hell, he's a great-looking guy. For a million bucks, I'd sleep with him. Maybe not. Hey, buddy! Come on! Come on! What have I done? D, it's me! D! D! Where is she? Where's my wife? Diana! Please! Where did they go? - Up! - Up where? - Helic?ptero. - Helicopter. D! D! D! D! D! They sent for me. They said you were ready. Come here. You missed a button. Thank you. I want to show you something. What happened? Lights went off. I see that. Why? Look. Can you turn those off, too? I am working on it. Who made the decision? - We both did. - No. Do it for your own reasons, or don't do it. You don't know him. I know he didn't stop you. And if you were mine... ...I wouldn't share you with anyone. You have no right to judge David. You're the one who has to buy women. You think I have to buy women? Why me, then? I bought you because you said you couldn't be bought. I can't be bought. We're just going to fuck, as I understand it. You might enjoy it. Don't bet on it. I think I will. Heads we do. Tails we call the whole thing off. Turn the boat around, go home. No hard feelings. What do you say? It's your party. It's my lucky dollar, so I can't lose. Trust me. Nothing's going to happen you don't choose. - I love you. - I love you. I told myself it was over, like a dream that vanishes in the morning light, and in time, enough time, I would forget. ?

P@rM!NdeR M@nk? ? P@rM!NdeR M@nk?? ? P@rM!NdeR M@nk?? ? P@rM!NdeR M@nk?? ? Yeah. All right. Yeah. A little fixer-upper south of Wilshire. It's nothing. Yeah. Look, I have got people here. I will talk to you later. Sorry. I am here for you now. All right. Two acres on Alta Loma... - Alta Vista. - That's right. Murphy property. We have been a little late on the payments. We want to settle up. I don't think that's possible. What do you mean? The mortgage is two months in default... ...and it appears that the property is in contract to another party. To another party? Who? That's privileged information. How can that be? We called specifically for an extension. The extension expired two days ago. If you don't make a payment, the bank can repossess. Without prior notice? Can they do that? They don't have to give us a warning. But, in fact, an attempt was made to call you on the 3rd. A registered letter, return receipt requested, was attempted on the 4th. Apparently there was no one home. We were out of town. Well, I am sorry, but you snooze, you lose. "You snooze, you lose." "You snooze, you lose"? - It's an expression. - That's beautiful. That's bullshit! This is bullshit, man! Don't deal with these people! They sold us out. They will sell you out, too. want to help me in the garden? OK. Our tomatoes are looking good, don't you think? David? What's "Gryphonne"? Gryphon. Where did you hear that name? You have a box of matches. We said we wouldn't talk about it. Yeah, well, now I want to talk about it. Don't you? - No. - D. I thought I could forget about this, but I can't. So I think maybe if we just talk about it, we can put it behind us. "Gryphon" is a boat. He took you to a boat? In Nevada? We flew to Santa Barbara. - What kind of boat? - A big boat. And then what? And then nothing. Where did you get the matches? Were you going through my bag? No! Why? What's in your bag? I am not going to talk about this. I am not going to do it. What? - Who were you talking to? - My mother. And what did Mom have to say? Nothing. She wasn't there. You said you were just talking to her. How could you be if she wasn't there? Well, I was trying to talk to her, but I didn't reach her. She wasn't in after ten o'clock? No, she's not. If you don't believe me, would you like to talk to her yourself? What is the matter with you? What is that? You know what it is. Where did you get this? In your wallet. I have never seen it. It was in the secret compartment. Have you been seeing him? - No! - You can't stop thinking about him. You won't let me. Why did you look in my wallet? I don't trust you. You know, I don't trust you either. Well, then we're even. I had to do something. I wanted to make something good out of all we'd done wrong. I decided to try and buy our land back. OK. Alta Vista. I just need to find out the guy's name. I want to make him an offer. I will get killed for this, Diana. I don't want you to get in trouble. - 543 Alta Vista. - There it is. There it is right there. Back up. Here we go. 543 Alta Vista. This guy's never going to sell, Diana. I just saw this guy on TV! You bastard! You stole our property. I'd like to introduce a friend of mine... I am not your friend. - Diana advised me on some property... - Bullshit! You took it and I want it back. I tell you what. Can we have... That's OK. No, everything's fine. Everything's under control. Excuse me. I am taking it off! Wait a minute... Why? Did you just want to hurt me? No! I think you're wonderful. That was our house! How could you? I got there first. I want you to sell it back to me. You can't afford it. How's a million dollars? The price is two. If I had two, the price would be four. Listen. I saw an opportunity and took it. You had the money and the right instincts, but you were too late. - I want you to work for me. - Go to hell. - Listen, I mean it. - Never. Why not? Because I hate you. No, you don't. You wish you hated me. Hi, D. You look awful. Where have you been? I will tell you about it. I am just going to have some wine first. Do you want some? So where have you been? Last night I stayed up for hours, trying to figure a way out of this mess. And today? And today I saw Gage. Thank you for your trust, David. And for listening. - Did you fuck him? - No! But you wanted to, right? I met him in broad daylight, in public. I don't believe you. David, he bought our property. That's why I went to see him. I just wanted to find some way to get it back. You have no reason to be jealous. I hate him. Tell me what happened on that boat. Don't do this! Tell me what happened! - Why? - because I want to know. All right, I will tell you. The man was a fucking stallion. Is that what you want me to say? We did it all night. Is that the truth? You don't want the truth. You want me to lie and say he's awful. So I will say it, and you won't believe me. Just tell me the truth, D. It was sex, David. Just sex. Not love, just sex. Was it good sex? Don't do this, David. Can you just tell me that, D? Why are you hesitating? Just tell me. Was it good? Yes. David. D, don't tell me it was just sex. You were attracted to him all along. That's bullshit. David, I did it for you. Don't tell me you did it for me. You did it for yourself. You were dying to do it. It's a lie. I would never do this for myself. It was all for you. Don't lie to me! You were attracted to him! I knew something like this was going to happen. I guess you make a deal with the devil, and eventually you pay the price. Thanks. From the man who closed the deal with the devil, that's very comforting. Green. - Hi, Di. - I am not here. Yeah, he's right here. You want to speak to him? No, I don't want to talk to him. Look, sweetie. He loves you. You love him. You got to try and work this out. It's pretty simple. This is a deal even I can't screw up. Tell him he can keep the money. I don't want any of it. Davey? She says she doesn't want the money. I don't want the money either. I will take it. I mean, if nobody else wants it. - Hi. - Hi, Diana. The next few weeks without David felt like months. I got very good at staring at walls. Diana, Diana. The recession has ended. There's a fella out there wants to see $10 million homes. There is a god. Find someone else. Are you nuts? Do you know what the commission is on $10 million? - I can't do it. - You have to do it. You're the best one I have. You're the only one I have. The others are all on caravan. I am sorry, Mr. Langford. I can't. I would never dream of forcing you to do anything against your will. Except this one time. Now move your ass or you're fired. If you think this is going to work, you underestimate me. You are truly beautiful. What do you think you're doing? Looking for a house. There's Bel Air, Benedict Canyon, Pacific Palisades. - Where would you like to go first? - Paris. 1120 Bel Air Road, please. The ceilings are French Gothic. Renaissance paintings, as you can see. Parquet floors throughout. The bathrooms are Italian marble. This is the master bath. Why didn't you return my calls? Do you like it? No. - 30 million minimum. - You think? - I know. - Let's look at it. It's not for sale. Everything's for sale. This is your house, isn't it? Do you like it? Well, it's certainly beautiful. What do you think it needs? Tell me. Honestly. I think it needs a life. I think it needs furniture and maybe a couple of dogs and flowers. It needs you. Just forget it. This just won't work. Why not? Because from where we have started we have got nowhere to go. You don't know that. I have never started this way either. I need you. No. You collect things. Don't you? Sometimes. Yeah. Even if you were extremely rich and smart can you be president? - No. - You couldn't be president? Why not? I took a second job teaching citizenship, just to keep myself busy. Ju, where were you born? I was born in Seoul, Korea. OK, where was she born? She was born in Seoul, Korea. That drug dealer, he is the president. In my country he could be both. Where were you born, Miguel? Sorry. Welcome back. - Where were you born? - Cuba. So, how do we say "Cuba" in America? Cuba. - Hi. - What are you doing here? - Isn't this the citizenship class? - Yes. - Can I sit in? - It's full. - Cuba. - Thank you. OK, um... I have a question for you. Excuse me. Is there something you'd like to share with us? I was just saying that you're an amazing woman. And beautiful. And talented. And I am crazy about her. You're full of surprises, aren't you? I am trying like hell. You should go. You want me to go? No! Nice people. They want the Dream. Well, they saw it in the flesh tonight. You have chalk on your face. I have something I want to show you. I didn't know whether you like big ones or little ones. You're so beautiful. Come here. I didn't have much time to do anything else. But it's a start. Dance? I should go. I remember once when I was young, and I was coming back from a movie or something, I was on the subway. There was a girl sitting across from me. She was wearing this dress that was buttoned clear up right to here. She was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. And I was shy then. So when she would look at me, I would look away. Then, afterwards, when I would look back, she would look away. Then I got to where I was going to get off, and got off. The doors closed. And as the train was pulling away, she looked right at me and gave me the most incredible smile. It was awful. I wanted to tear the doors open. I went back every night, same time, for two weeks. But she never showed up. That was 30 years ago. And I don't think there's a day that goes by that I don't think about her. I don't want that to happen again. Just one dance? ? P@rM!NdeR M@nk?? ? ?

What you don't know is we got a secret, me and Diana. We're invincible. Diana, I need to talk... Tomorrow might be a better time. Tomorrow might be better, you think? Johnny-baby, I got a suggestion for you. You know that emblem you got? The gryphon? The eagle? I don't think it's a good idea. I got a better idea. How about the cuckoo? Because... I am talking to you for a second. The cuckoo is interesting. It doesn't have its own nest, so it moves into the nest of other birds and destroys their eggs. David, stop. You don't love me anymore? Have I ever told you I love you? Have a nice dinner. - Help him. - Here. Go inside. You got him? D. You have done a lot since USC. First in your class. AIA award. - Prix de Rome. - Yeah. Why would you want this job? Well, I want to work. Overqualified. Fine. Exploit me. Great architecture only comes from your passion, and even that won't assure you a job. Louis Kahn. Died in a men's room in Penn Station. For days, no one claimed the body. Look at that. Is that beautiful? The money men did not weep, because the great ones are impossible to deal with. They're a pain in the ass, because they know that if they do their jobs properly, if they just this once get it right, they can actually lift the human spirit, take it to a higher place. - What is this? - A brick. Good. What else? A weapon. Louis Kahn said, "Even a brick wants to be something." A brick wants to be something. It aspires. Even a common, ordinary brick wants to be something more than it is. Wants to be something better than it is. That is what we must be. See you on Friday. A brick wants to be something? I bet it doesn't want to be a lawyer. What are you doing here? I missed you. - I missed you, too. - Thanks. - How you doing? - I am good. I am getting it together. She wants a divorce. She wants her freedom. If you don't contest it, you get everything. The land, the money. Everything. Where is she? Hi, everybody. I am Billy Connolly. Goodbye, everybody. You may wonder what you're doing here, sitting in the blazing sun, as the smell of the zoo wafts past your nostrils. The reason you are here is because you are loaded. May I say how brilliant it is to see so many people with an interest in the preservation of endangered species. Every year, we have this unique way of making money for the cause. We auction animals. We bid as high as we possibly can, and the money goes to sponsor these lovely beasts. Let's start the show with a bang. We have got a superstar as our first animal. Ladies and gentlemen, the hippo. The animal itself is far too big and angry to bring along. Look at this guy. Thousands and thousands of pounds of aggressive, hostile cellulite. Weighs slightly less than the average school bus. And look at that magnificent beastie. To put him in a better light, to relieve you of some serious money... Thank you very much. ...we have a kissy-kissy picture. Isn't that nice? Ladies and gentlemen, I couldn't dream of starting the bid below $10,000. - Now, I know it's a lot of money... - 30. $30,000, ladies and gentlemen! Call me a sentimental old fool, do I hear 35? - 35. - $35,000! - 40. - $40,000! 45,000. - 50. - $50,000. I can't believe it. That's extraordinary. 50,000 once, 50,000 twice, ladies and gentlemen... One million dollars. I am sorry? One million dollars. Did you say one million dollars, sir? Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, one million dollars. Would anybody care to top that, ladies and gentlemen? I didn't think so. In that case, sir, I believe you're the proud owner of a hippo. Congratulations. Hello, Diana. The next animal to take the stand is an ostrich... I really wanted you to have that money. I really wanted you to have that hippo. Maybe you two would like a moment alone. So... - How are you... - I hear you're teaching... - Sorry. - Go ahead. Yeah. I am teaching. You know, it doesn't pay much, but at least I get to talk about architecture. You know how I love to talk about architecture. Don't leave, ladies and gentlemen. It's just a shower. A cheque book makes an ideal umbrella. Do we have a dolphin? Have we a dolphin and an octopus? How about tropical fish? I know. You're running home for more cash. Come on, ladies and gentlemen. You can find the money. To hell. I am gone. I have to talk to you about what happened. - Don't. - No. I have to. Just hear me out. I think the mistake I made in Vegas was thinking that I could forget what we did. I thought we were invincible. Now I know that the things that people in love do to each other, they remember. And if they stay together, it's not because they forget, it's because they forgive. I was just... I was just so afraid that you wanted him. No, actually, I was afraid you were right to want him. I thought he was the better man. And I know now he's not. He's just got more money. I think we should talk. I am very happy. Shackleford, have you ever seen me like this? Can't say that I have. Diana's the reason. Enough for any man. She is the best of them. Absolutely. You are the best of them. "The best of them"? You said I am the best of them? You are. I don't understand. Shackleford, could you explain it to her? What? I could do that, sir. But I feel Mrs. Murphy would rather hear it from you. OK. All right. She's the best of the million-dollar club. Obviously. "Million-dollar club"? Now you have got it. You told me you'd never done that before. How many members would you say there are? - Members? - Yeah. - Worldwide? - Yeah. I think a couple of dozen. Remember the one that wouldn't stop hiccuping? - What? - The waitress from Oklahoma. Every time you came near her, she would convulse in hiccups. Yeah. I had forgotten. Quite a night. The best thing of it is that you know if you're sexually compatible right from the start. Shackleford, would you stop the car? Thank you, John. Goodbye. Goodbye. Here. For luck. - Take care of him. - Sure. What was all that about? I wanted to end it. She never would have looked at me the way she did at him. Seven years ago, David proposed to me at Paradise Cove. I wanted to go there to remember and start over. Have I ever told you I love you? No. I do. Still? Always. # Roy Orbison: "A Love So Beautiful" # The summer sun looked down # On our love long ago # But in my heart I feel # The same old afterglow # A love so beautiful # In every way # A love so beautiful # We let it slip away # We were too young to understand # To ever know # That lovers drift apart # And that?s the way love goes # A love so beautiful # A love so sweet # A love so beautiful # A love for you and me # And I when I think of you # I fall in love again # A love so beautiful # In every way # A love so beautiful # We let it slip away ? ? ?
