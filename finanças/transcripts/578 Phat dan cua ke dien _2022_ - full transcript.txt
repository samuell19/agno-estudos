-Daddy! -Yes! S… U… N S… H… I… N… E. -Sunshine. -Good job! Daddy, are there a lot of friends at school? -Yes, sweetie! -I’m going to miss you so much! I’ll see you every ten days, alright? Every ten days, you promise? Wow! Flowers! Daddy… Woah… flying elephants… Argh… Why couldn't I catch this salamander…? I… I'm sorry. It was my fault. Please allow me… to take care of An. Please stay with An in the meantime. Your daughter still needs more time in therapy. She’s terrified and unstable. So, you should avoid seeing her at least for now. Sweetheart. Sweetie. It's me. I'm Ms. Tam. Don't be afraid. There’s no one here, no one at all. It's me. Don't be afraid. There’s no one here, no one at all. It's me. Your irregular schedule affects my business heavily. From now on, I will deliver more regularly. COLD STORAGE Anyway, where is An? Daddy, Ms. Tam taught me to write three pages of paper. But why haven't you come back after ten days? I want to play “Mandarin Square Capturing” with you. Play with me. -Hello, Ms. Tam. -Good morning. -Sweetie, say hi to Ms. Tam. -Hi, Ms. Tam. Hello, sweetheart. You're going to make a lot of friends here. Come and play with me. I'll leave her with you. -No need to worry. -Thank you! Jeez, missing a punch like that! Mr. Bang, have you seen my father's truck? I don't know who your father is. Have you seen my father's truck at the port? You should stay outside, An is still distressed. I… I just want to see her for a minute. Hey An, Daddy's here. I'll take care of this. An, I’m here, it’s okay, don’t be scared! Sweetheart, don't cry. I’m here, it’s okay, don’t be scared! I’m right here. I thought you changed the route. Do you remember my daughter’s face? There were thousands of people coming in and out. How could I remember? -Have you seen the girl in this photo? -I don’t know! Go ask somewhere else! I haven’t seen her. I haven’t seen her. I told you I don't know about your daughter. What are you doing here, sweetie? I… I'm looking for my father. Oh… I know your father. So… let me help you find him. Okay… let's go! Go away, I don’t know your daughter. She was here. So I'll beat you up till you do. Fuck off, I don't need to know your daughter. Mr. Bang? Mr. Bang? Mr. Bang, please let me in. You agreed earlier. Leave it there. Here. You knew she was here. Because you left her there. Where did she go? Just follow that girl. I'll deal with your later. Sir, please buy some bread. I gave you the big doll last time, this one is her younger sister. Aren't they pretty? They're a pair now. Do you like them? Mr. Thai, there's an emergency. Go play with your dolls. Shh, your father asked me to pick you up. Sweetie… Sweetie… Where are you?… Sweetie… pumpkin pie, I'll give you more dolls… Where are you hiding? Baby… Sweetie… Come here, my little baby! Sweetie… I have no parents. I'm sorry. I live with my blind grandma. Hey, wake up! Damn it! Who the hell are you? You lost two dolls, remember? I'm not playing dolls. Who are you? I'm her father. She's not your child. How do you know I'm not her father? Hey listen, I've got loads of money. Do you want my money? You're going to regret this. You will stay with my fish. Do you have any idea how powerful I am? My family is an ant colony. You can’t kill us all. Then I won't kill you, I'll burn them all. Boss! My son… has been missing. Your bread girl is nowhere to be found. That scumbag also lost his daughter here, didn't he? If my son can't be found, then neither can you. Find him! Yes, sir. Tell me the truth. If I confess to this crime, you will kill me. I'd die for something I didn't do. Whether I live or die is up to you. But I never laid a finger on your daughter. You've got the wrong guy, you psycho. I didn't do anything. I said I don't know your daughter. Let me go, I didn't do anything to your daughter. Hey… I need some help… hey… Hey… I was ignored by everyone except you. I patched up the crack on the hydraulic hose. Couldn't jump-start the truck, and the battery was almost dead. Let me take a look. Jeez another one that's sick in the head. Hey… Hey… Hey… here. I'm Bao Vi. I just changed to this route. Here, some money for the hose. Not for the help. You don't have to pay me. LONG PHUONG Hey! Son. Gigantic Son. I'm in here. I have to admit that you're fast. Dumbasses! You've got some guts laying your hand on the boss' son. Idiot! Bunch of shitheads! You've got to save me. If I die, my father will massacre your family. I can wait till you bleed out… and get rid of your body. You idiot, I'm the one who's bleeding to death, not him Slutty Long, leave it to me. I hear you like setting ants on fire. If you keep scorching them, they will crawl out. All over your face, your ears. Take one more step and fall off the cliff… or join me… I'll spare you. Come on! Come on! Come here! Come on! Join me. I like this feeling. Come on! Join me. Damn it! You're dead, and you won't be hearing this. Your daughter enjoys playing with my dolls. She likes them a lot. She likes them a lot… a lot… My son must have suffered a lot. I will do everything you request. Please help me. Make him whole again! Boss, he is an ex-task force member who has been discharged for seven years He was trained to crawl to you guys. You are nothing but a pile of flesh. Why take his kid? Sir, they're all our items… We thought her father was a silly one. Also, it is for Mr. Thai's amusement. Slutty Long, you're wrong. Come on! Move! An, I'm sorry! Meow, meow… Wake up, sweetheart. The doctor said An's condition is improving. She still hasn't talked to anyone, though. If anything happens… please take care of An for me. Hung, why did you say that? Hung! The most important thing now is that your daughter is still alive. She needs you. Please don't do anything reckless. They must pay for what they've done. Even if they hide under the ground, I'll dig everything up to find them. Tell me again, how did she get away? Boss, she had a fever and suffered a seizure. I thought she was going to die. If a part of the railway is stolen, the train will overturn regardless of the length. You told me everything was taken care of. But I still see fish being sold. You let a piece of him live. He will find you. I'll finish him. Do you know what is more challenging than fighting? Making money, tons of money. Money can't speak for itself. But it holds the power that can kill that scumbag. You guys still up for a hunt? You ran in here… Avoid being crushed under my wheels. Confirmed. I don't know who you people are. Well! Loan-The Winner, such a joke, still a loser! Sometimes the music reveals what the musician has been hiding. The better the musician, the more emotions he shows. Your grandfather once said, "Money is a cure." We have every kind of "cure," but you only have one life. Boss, our people have arrived. You're my only child. And he is still out there somewhere. Hi, I have gifts for you all. Ah… presents. Here you are. Be good. Having fun with the girls? You really are something Let me guess… You're chasing us down. And you're coming to get her. Like father, like daughter, I have no idea how she could survive and find a way back to you. MS. TAM END CALL You shouldn't have hung up on me. The fun is yet to come. You'll be treated nicely this time. And your daughter's life will depend on you. Bastard! An, Daddy's here, don't be afraid! Finally, I have the chance to see you face to face. And you… won't be seeing your daughter. If you can get through these piles of flesh. I will let you reunite with your daughter unconditionally. Any last words? Let my daughter go. There's no such thing in the agreement. Stop! An… I kept my word and allowed you to reunite. But I'm not sure my boss wants to stop here. You coming at us won't end well. Finish them both! Luu Tuan Ly, also known as Poker Face Ly Speed up the shipments. CHANGE OF PLAN. SPEED UP THE SHIPMENTS. Why are you rushing us so hard this time? Are you at full capacity yet? How many can we still harvest eggs from? We've been working nonstop. There are still a lot to retrieve. Take all the eggs, the market price is at all-time high. Others will take care of the remaining work. Crying like that is not very nice. Her eyes are precious. Move! -Stop crying! -Move! Get in! -Stop crying! -Move! Shut up. Hurry up! Hurry! -Shut up. -Hurry up! Move! -Move! -Sit! The boss ordered us to speed up the shipments. Yes, sir. Mr. Thai has arrived safely, sir. You and your daughter are still alive? It was me who took your daughter. So what? What are you going to do about it? So what? What are you going to do about it? You're good at diving, but you can't hide for too long. Your daughter was shouting your name for days. She was screaming and crying. Get out of the water and fight me. No matter what he did to you, he is still my son. You can kill me instead and let him go. You gave him the whole world. And I, I will take everything from you. Please fall back, sir. I will bring him down. He wants me. Open all the gates. YOU CAN CHECK THESE FIVE LOCATIONS Useless! You lured him into the water to beat him. He must have choked on water. I miss him, he will always be my little boy. Save me, Father! When he was small and crying, I stayed up all night to put him to sleep. I like that feeling. Now I'm hearing him cry and can't do anything. Whoever made him cry. I hate them the most. If this is the last chance… I want to ask you something. Do you know that madmen are always the ones who break records? I only hunt. The fact that you had the nerve to fight back is a record in itself. If you're not crazy enough to accept my fortune, that is another record. This is where it ends. If you shoot, your son will die. We're not done yet, even if you get out of this alive. I have to finish this once and for all. I have to kill you. My daughter is everything to me, more than my life. I don't need any records. You can choose to jump or stay in my truck. You can return to your daughter. He's guilty of multiple charges. Justice will take its course. Daddy! CHARITY 115 EMERGENCY CENTER One has many faces to show society. This shall be your last one. If Thai couldn't do it, leave it to me, Father.
