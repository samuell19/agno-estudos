Gentlemen. You must transfer this key token to our off-site security vault. Don't worry, ma'am. We have our best undercover guards on the job. [vault door thuds] [truck door bangs] The diaper is in the hamper. Time to change the baby. [chuckling darkly] No one will suspect anything. [♪♪♪] Whoo! Yeah! [gasping] Spider-Man! [woman gasps] Oh! Don't get me wrong, web-slinging from building to building is great, but now I can totally see why Captain America has one of these! [vroom!] [whoosh] Whoa! What was that? This mochachino-- it's got no kick. Ahh! Mochachino! [panicking and screaming] [Venom cackling evilly] Roxxon security! Back away from the truck! -Have a nice trip! -[shrieking] I'm okay! [Green Goblin cackling] Let's kick things off with a bang! [explosion roars] [citizens panicking and screaming] [Venom huffs] [driver grunts] Finally! -[Spider-Man]: Gobby! -[gasping] [Spider-Man]: Venom! I thought I told you-- I don't like people messing up my neighborhood. [fuming]: Spider-Man! That's the thing about spiders-- hit them right, and they splatter like a bug! Whoa! Come on, Green Goblin! Pumpkins are not meant to be weapons... They're meant to be pie. Whoa! [Venom grunts] I'm gonna take you apart! Hey, Venom! Don't touch the ride! What? I just got it waxed. [Venom cries out] -[Spider-Man laughing] -Alley-oop! Uh-oh. I bet this never happens to Captain America-a-a-a! Ooh! Ah! Oof. Ugh. You were too beautiful for this world, Spidey-bike. Ugh. He's down! Now we finish him. No! Stick to the plan. If we destroy New York City, then we destroy Spider-Man! Destroying the city... destroys Spider-Man. I can still chase 'em the classic way. Whoo! Yeah! [laughs] [chuckling darkly] Fetch the gear. With my tech and this orange key token, all we need is to steal the other key token, then no one can stop our plan to overload and melt down the city. Then revenge on Spider-Man! That's why we're working together. You bring the muscle and I bring the smarts. "Smarts"? A lot of words come to mind when I think of you. "Smart" is not one of 'em. [Venom fuming] Stick to the plan! I'll handle the insect. I don't need Goblin anymore. I just need his tech. I can do this on my own. [Spider-Man]: This place is nice, Gobby! What's the rent on a lab like this? [Green Goblin cackles] -Whoa! -You can't dodge forever! Dude, have you met me? Yeah, I can! Nyah! Whoa! Ahh! I ain't gonna lie-- this is pretty fun! I'm done with you! [Spidey laughs] -Wah! -[thud] Huh? Gobby... throwing those bombs will wreck your lab. I don't want it anymore. It's got a pest problem. Pest? [sweetly]: Moi? Spidey steps up to the plate... ...And he swings! [gasps] Ahh! [groans] Good game, Gobby. I hope you had as much fun as I did. [groaning]: Ugh... I'll take that as a "yes." I know this is Spider-Man's thing and all, but sometimes I wish he would just give the bad guy to us. [sighing] We better go find a stepladder. [Goblin struggling and grunting] [Spidey]: Venom got away, which is not good... and I still have no idea what Green Goblin and Venom had planned, which is really not good. On the bright side, look at all this! Holographic scanners... 3-D printers... Mm! Micro-circuitry... [stoked]: A rotary phone! Man! This place has everything! Wait... Green Goblin's in jail. He's not gonna be using this place for a while... so there's no reason why I can't stay here and use this lab for myself. Everything's comin' up Spidey! High-five! -[thud] -Oh. Your science project will be due in one week. I expect you to show creativity. I expect you to build something high-tech, and I expect you to pay attention to detail. [snaps]: Mr. Parker! Did you hear what I said? Uh... of course I did. What you said was very inspiring. I was moved. Don't mess this up, Mr. Parker, or you will be serving detention for the next 22 and a half years. That seems excessive. And disturbingly specific. -[bell rings] -[thud] Hey, Pete. Mary Jane and a bunch of us are going to visit a renewable energy lab to get ideas for the science project. Wanna come with? Ah, thanks, Gwen, but I-I can't. I have stuff I have to get done. Later. But preferably sooner. [chuckles] You know how it is. Parker out! He is an odd duck. I feel bad I had to skip out on Gwen and MJ like that, but I couldn't tell them the truth... ...that I'm busy turning this lab into my new base. First off, my base needs a name. "Spidey Cave"? Mm, too dark and brooding. "Spidey-Rainbow Happy-Land"! No, no, no, not dark and brooding enough. How about... the Spidey Lab? Yeah. That works! And it's catchy. Hashtag "Spidey Lab." [shutter snaps] This has to be the biggest, most advanced super-computer in the history of the world. I'll install video games on it later. First, I need to get past the security firewall. The perfect job for my latest invention... the encryption spiders! And while the encryption spiders do their thing, I can do my thing. [gasps] With the lab and all this raw material, I can make the best science fair project ever. All I need now is a retro music-video montage. Hit it! [♪♪♪] Whoa... oh, ho... ahh! [thud] [gasping] [groans] [shrieking] Another leave-it-in-the-alley delivery. Once again, no tip. [clang!] Huh? [sighs contentedly] Mm... Ahh! Iron Man was right. This BLT is better than the one down on 7th. [computer starts beeping and whirring] Yes! The encryption spiders have cracked the security. First, let's see if I can use it to find Venom. I'll set up an automated search of the city's networks for the most recent reports of criminal activity and property destruction. -[beeping] -Nice! A lead on Venom's location. But before I take him on, I could use some new tech to give me the advantage, and I know exactly what I need. [Venom grumbles] Hmm? [whirring and humming] [students gasping] What's this for again? It looks good for the tour groups that march through here. [both snickering] [glass shattering as Venom roars] [scientists gasping] What do you want? Rah! I want the key token. Now! We don't have the key token. Where is it? [gasping] It's locked up in the vault. [chortles evilly] [scientist]: Gah! [laughs] [Venom cackling darkly] [Spider-Man]: You better not touch that. You don't know where it's been. [darkly]: Spider-Man! [Venom grunting] Aw, is the evil symbiote rage-monster unhappy? [grunting] [roars] Oh, that can't be good. [Venom laughs] Whoa... oh, oh. Ahh! [Venom]: You got a tech upgrade... but I got an upgrade, too. [Spider-Man]: Oh! Ugh! [grunting] [both grunting] Rah! -Uh-oh. -[Venom roaring] [thud] Ahh! Ugh. [Venom cackling] [Spidey]: You got lucky with one hit. I bet you can't do that again. Just watch me! [Venom roaring] [Spidey]: Whoa! Yeah, I was wrong. Spider-Man? More like... "Pinata-Man"! [thud] I see my quips are rubbing off on ya. [scientists panicking] [rumbling and creaking] [all gasping] This glass wall-- it won't break, will it? [teacher]: It's shatterproof-- although, with all this weight on it, it could theoretically still-- [Mary Jane]: Well, technically, it didn't break! Spider-Man? [realizing]: Spider-Man! Gwen and MJ? This is the science lab they visited? I gotta save 'em! Can Spider-Man come out and play? Um... no. Rah! -[thudding] -Ow! This is why I don't like to play with you, Venom! [Spidey grunting] You're way too rough! [grunts] Whoa-oh-oh! [Venom grunts] [thud] [panicked screaming] [alarm sounding] Someone needs to get these people out. Someone like me. [grunts] Everyone! This way! Come on, everyone, l-let's go! [thud] [crying out] Gwen! MJ! Grab on! [both grunting] [all straining intensely] Ahh! Thank you. Follow me. [building rumbling] Wah! [Venom grunting] [Spidey grunting] Gwen! Come on! Go on without me! I'll catch up. [Venom roars] -Whoo! -Wha--? Rah! [grunting] Ahh! [crowd gasping] Oh, no! [webs whooshing] [grunting intensely] That should keep it from falling on anyone. So then why is my Spidey-Sense tingling? [Venom grunts] Ahh! [crashing] [roaring] Destroying the city destroys Spider-Man! [Venom chuckles darkly] [Spidey sighs] How did my life come to this? Ugh. Venom got away. Again. Not great, Spidey. Not great. [engine whooshing] You're clearly not Spider-Man, because I'm Spider-Man. We haven't met yet. I'm Ghost Spider. I've been... kinda tracking you. Tracking me? I don't owe you money, do I? [rumbling] [citizens gasping] I've got this side! And I've got this side. [grunting] [crowd gasps and applauds] So you're "Ghost Spider"? [scoffs] That's a little unoriginal, don't you think? -Excuse me? -I-- I... I like your outfit. It's a nice color combo. But you know, I'm more into red and blue. I... feel that the combo of colors really are, are, uh, stronger than, uh... I'm just babbling and I'm hoping something will happen to end this awkward moment. [Ghost Spider chuckles] In case you ever need backup, use this. Oh? They used to have things like this called "pagers," from a long-lost era from the past. The 1980s. "A long-lost era from the past." [chuckles] Yeah. I'm gonna ghost. Keep in touch. [grunts] Whoa... [anxiously]: Ohh... Everybody all right? Venom took the key token! I see. Now let's pretend that I don't know what a key token is. A key token is a high-level security key. One token by itself doesn't do anything, but if he gets his hands on two...? Then Venom can override and take over any Roxxon Energy system in the world. Yikes! Almost sorry I asked. [Peter]: Green Goblin and Venom teamed up to steal a key token. I stopped Goblin, but now Venom has two key tokens. He can override and control Roxxon Energy systems. But what would Venom want to take over? [phone rings] Hello? -Hey, Peter, where are you? -Oh, hey, Gwen. [Gwen]: How's your science project coming along? Everyone else is almost done. Y-Yeah, I'm working on it now. Hey, while I've got you, what do you know about Roxxon Energy? [Gwen]: Mm. Big company. They're in the process of building new clean energy platforms just outside the city. Energy platforms... That must be it. Thanks, Gwen! -Peter-- [beep] Bingo. [yawning] Hmm... Heh-heh-heh-ha. [thud] Ahh! Oh... [screaming] Ah! [splashing] [security guards gasping] [panel beeping] [grunts] [energy humming] [chuckling deviously] [beep] [skittering] [beeps and whooshes] [energy crackling] Soon, the generator will overload New York City... [loud electrical humming] [beeping] [citizens gasping] [electricity buzzing] [bulbs exploding] [screaming] -[guy stops screaming] -[coin hits hat] [resumes screaming] Destroying the city destroys Spider-Man. [Spidey]: Venom! Huh? Yoo-hoo! Do you like it? A little somethin' I threw together. I'm gonna have to ask you what that big glowing thing behind you does. Then I'm gonna ask you to step aside, so I can step on it! Destroying the city destroys Spider-Man. Destroy the city first! Are you sure? I mean, I'm right here. [darkly]: City can wait. Destroy Spider-Man now! [Venom roars] You can't destroy little ol' me. [Venom cries out and grunts] [Venom grunts] Whoa... [grunts] Ahh! Yoink! [crashing] [growling] [chuckling sinisterly] [electricity crackling] Hmm... Don't know what it does, but it's probably best not to wait and find out. Spidey-Sense going off... big-time! Like it? Just a little something I threw together. It's a bit much. Rah! [grunting] [Venom roaring] Ahh! The mech is too strong! I'm gonna need some help. [crying out and groaning] Have to stop that generator! Whoa! Going somewhere? [Venom grunts] Ah! Aw, my arm. That was my favorite arm. [Venom growling] Almost out of time. Rah! Uh-oh... Ah! [thud] [Spidey]: Oh! My other favorite arm! Just because I can't move, don't think this is-- [Venom hissing] Okay, that's just gross. [Venom gasps] Somebody call for backup? -Ghost Spider! -Yeah! [Venom roars] [Venom cries out] [Ghost Spider]: And down goes Venom. -[chuckles] Whoo! -Thanks for the save. Cool ride, by the way. I'll stop the generator. You keep Venom busy. [thud] I get to take out Venom? Suh-weet! [Venom growls] [tauntingly]: Ha-ha! [roaring] Gotta be quicker than that! [Venom grunting] You're either really bad at this... or I am just that good! Whoo! [snickering] [roaring] Here goes nothing. [grunts] Wow, that was nothing. Out of time! Have to find some way to disable the tech. Huh? Wait. "Disable the tech"? It's not the tech... It's what's powering it! The key tokens. Ghost Spider, I need your help. You got it! The energy platform is powering Gobby's tech. If we use the key tokens to shut down the platform, it'll remove the energy that's destroying the city. We need to simultaneously activate the key tokens. Three... Two... One... -Go! -[clunk] We're in! I've got control of all the platform systems. Rerouting the power! [humming groans and slows] [beeping] [rumbling] [camera shutter snapping] [energy crackling] The power is overloading! What? [crackling] This whole platform's going to blow! [Venom, roaring]: No! [Venom cries out] [Ghost Spider]: No sign of him. He must've escaped into the water. When he shows up again, we'll be ready for him. What's important is that we've got the key tokens. I feel pretty good about how things turned out. [flames whooshing] Really? [hisses and fumes] Spider-Man! I think I'm gettin' the hang of this superhero gig. I feel pretty much prepared for anything. [snoring loudly] [aghast]: The science project is due today! And I'm the only one who... Uh-oh. I gotta find something... anything! [thud] It's a model of a renewable energy generator. Interesting attempt, Mr. Parker, but this looks like you just glued two table legs together. I know what it looks like. [crash] It is definitely what it looks like. Hey, Pete. Mary Jane and I are putting together a study group. Sounds fun. I'll join you... just as soon as I finish all the detention I got for taking apart school property. [chuckling] See ya later, Pete. Have fun with that. Time to start serving my 22 and a half years of detention. [ominous rumbling in distance] [cackling evilly] [cackling] Correction. Time for your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man! [whoosh] [♪♪♪] ♪ Go! ♪ ♪ Let's go, let's go... ♪ ♪ Let's go, let's go! ♪ ♪ Let's go, let's go... ♪ [♪♪♪]
