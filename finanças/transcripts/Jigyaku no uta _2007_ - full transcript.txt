Thank you so much! It's beautiful.

Directed by Yukihiko Tsutsumi Father! Just when I was feeling a little bit happy... Father! I always have the worst misery... Mother, I've always been so unhappy. Do you want to find happiness? Yeah, even a bit is fine. I want to feel happy. Just leave this town. But you can't ever come back. If you really try, you can change that poor face. Mother, I want to be happy. Really, just a bit is fine. Happily Ever After He's... dead! Good morning. Nice day today. You say that rain or shine. 'Morita' Police car required. He's the third one today! Hey, are you alive? Dead? Which one? He's dead. That's hot! Hello, 'Tobita Rooms.' What?! Yukie! Yukie! Po... Good morning, Auntie. Police called! It's Isao! Isao! Ouch! Don't fall! Darling... Darling! What's wrong? Please, where's my darling?! Who is that? Darling! Darling! Darling! Where are you! Darling! Darling... Darling? Candles? Darling! Don't die! It's alright, Mrs... He's just asleep, he's drunk. Sorry, it was the only room available. Look, somebody punched him. Settle down! This guy did. But he's the victim. It's him! He hit me and extorted money! It's true, then he used it to get drunk. I scare the crap out of you! My boss will shred you, and stick you beside ET at USJ, Universal Studios! Tough to look after such a violent husband. We're not married... You're not married to him?! What do you see in him? Thank you very much. You can't carry him. Take one of those bikes. She can't! - May I? - You can't! Thank you! We're just holding them, you can't, Mrs...! Don't call her Mrs! Darling. Hold on tight. Shall I call a taxi? I'll be okay. It's impossible. No tandem riding. Ignore it. It's illegal. Take them in the police car. You must be joking! Watch out, darling, be careful! It's broken! Thank you so much. It's on our way. Ouch! Take me to the hospital. I'm sure it's broken. Don't exaggerate! We're leaving. We're almost home. Don't give up. Now it's done. First, the main dish, beef... Darling, let's have breakfast. This morning I noticed the pickles are ready. Let's begin! Pitiful... Hello, Yukie? Huh? Take-out order?! Idiot! Don't bother me! Sorry to be late. Yukie? You showed up! Oops... it's closed today. No, just opening now! Hello. Take-out order? Of course! Great machine, what a winner! I just can't lose! Taro... What is it? Let's switch. You can't be serious! Of course. I don't mind. I understand, take it easy... Please, I insist. Leave the winnings. Leave it. - Good night. - Good night. Here's this month's pay. Plus a small bonus. Thank you! Let me know if I can do anything for you. For example.. just an idea... if he kicked you out... I live alone upstairs. One or two more... you're most welcome. If need be... if need be, even from tonight... I'm going now. Another great machine! Real winner! Taro... Yes? Let's switch. Thought so. He'! - Darling?! Welcome home. I'll prepare dinner right away. A grain of rice. What did you do today? Pachinko. How'd it go? You win? Well, you can't always win. I know, take me to pachinko next time you go. Let's go on a date. Pachinko isn't for fun. It's not work... wretched... Is it good? Should be, it cost 4,000 yen. Too expensive! Fatty tuna! He's so late. I've had enough of this. Let's begin. Here, I wish it was more. Sorry, Auntie. I'll pay it back soon. There's no hurry. After all, you're like a daughter to me. Have a sweet. Thank you. What a rotten guy! Even steals your pay envelope. He may win 100 million yen on today's horse race... He won't, you fool! What kind of guy does this?! Yesterday was the 36th time this year. Look! He can't do anything but turn over the table! It's not obvious, but he also has a good side... Yukie! He was great, it was 100 to 1. It wasn't 100, it was 6! How awful. Misery made you crazy! Let's do it. Do it? - Let's do it. - Do it? Hairy! You're a man! You mean no? No? Mean no? Welcome! Welcome! Sir, how about it? Some real nice girls. Not interested. There's no one better than Yukie. Huh? Yukie? If you want Yukie, come on in. Yukie's here?! Yukie. Ouch! - Yukie! - The fee! Thanks for choosing me, I'm Yukie. Stripped down already? You're in a real hurry! Nice to meet you, I'm a 20-year-old college student. Be gentle with me. Lotion, lotion... Could you turn off the light? Here's your order. Let's get started. Yukie... Yes? Come over here. Don't ask why, but I want you to have this. What is this? Well, it's not very much... a special bonus. Not exactly a bonus, a consolation fee. Sorry. Actually, I... in a moment of terrible weakness, I was unfaithful. Forgive me. Money won't resolve it. Yukie, I want you to always be here... Yukie? Yukie? You've got the fever, the fever, the fever, and then it's Travolta! Another win! What a payout! Both of us keep winning! Balls are piling up! Yukie, fried rice, noodles. Okay. Fried rice and Chinese noodles. - Yukie. - Yes? Come over here. Your hand... soft. What is this? It's just a little good luck charm. Ahh! What's this?! What's going on here? You make cockroach noodle soup here? House special?! Hey, pay us 100,000 yen! Then we'll spare you. 100,000 yen?! It's no big deal for us. We'll hang a sign outside, 'CAUTION: Cockroach Noodle Soup.' Good idea. Please stop! Shut up! Out of my way, woman! You know, that customer just... Money. - Money. - Who the hell are you? We get the money! Run for it! Wow, he looks cold. It's not warm in here, it's hot! Coffee shop global warming. Hawaiian! Spaghetti! Hey, there's Yukie. You're right. She looks really cold. She should be Hawaiian, too. Shall I go call her'! Idiot. She's working right now. Don't bother her. Just a few minutes break... Shut up, just shut up. A cop questioned me. I said, "I'm not unemployed, I just don't work.' Yeah! Yeah. He said, 'You don't work, you're trash...' 'Get a job, sweat!' I said, 'I sweat daily in the sauna." Sauna. I really said that. Then what? Cop got mad and said, 'I'll arrest you for obstruction." Haven't seen you much. Were you in jail? I was called "Number 32." No, idiot! I wasn't in jail! Sorry about that! Hey, let's take a day trip to a hot spring'! I mean it. There are some real hot married women... Sorry to keep you waiting. What happened? You're late. Noodles, 750 yen. I'm not paying- That's a problem... Look at it, everything's mushy. Nobody can eat that. Darling! Wh... What do you want? Fight? Darling... Thanks for today. He'! - Yes? Lunch box. Lunch box? I'll work... tomorrow. Really? Yeah. Thank you. Another drink. Darling... Pitiful... “Harmony” Be quiet! Darling! You forgot it. Have a good day! What's up, something good happen? Auntie! Morning. Hey, what are you doing?! Pay attention! Please wait. New guy! Get somebody moving. That stoplight was red, wasn't it?! Hang on! Old guy! Say something! A mannequin can just stand there! Get these ones moving! Hey, go back 30 feet! You, 30 feet! Just back up everyone, 30 feet! We'll take it right away. Thanks. Boss, two rice bowls to deliver. Okay. How's the taste? Oh, a grain of rice. Yukie. Did something good happen? Can you tell? Of course, we're together every day like a married couple. Actually, he started working from today. So I'm going to work hard, too. Welcome! Two of us, noodles... I see, he's no longer unemployed. Well, that's good. That's good. To my dear Mother, why did you give birth to me? Pots are on fire. Huh? Aren't you Hayama? That's right! You are Hayama! It's me, Hanazawa. 'Us guys dropped at Yale's, gonna feed on grill beef at Tsuruhashi.' 'Maybe slurp down ice cream at Universal Studios. This road okay?" Like it? Ain't my Osaka dialect good? If you mean 'USJ, ' it's over there. Huh, is it called USJ? I'm more of a Disneyland type. I heard you quit the job at Koda's, but what are you doing here? Is it for that ugly woman? Why? Punishment? He must like ugly women. She used to be... Hayama! Hey. stop that! Somebody call the police! Army, riot squad! Excuse me! Sorry. Darling... darling... I don't know what caused the fight. He is silent and the two beaten yakuza are too scared to talk. Could be related to being in the same Tokyo gang. - Do you know them, Mrs...? - Don't call her Mrs! No, I don't know. Such an honest wife wouldn't know. Sorry. Don't call her Mrs! He fought yakuza, so we'll ignore it this time. In any case, witnesses said that he could easily have killed them. Darling... Mrs..., he forgot this. So... Why did you get in a fight? Darling, just when you'd decided to work again. You can't just fight all the time. You have to hold back. Darling! Where are you going? Do you have money? You'll come home today? Mother... What is the true nature of happiness'? And is happiness always found in this world that we live in? I haven't been able to find happiness for myself. Ever since that day that you abandoned me... Cigarette? Hey, stop it. It's been quite a while, Hayama. Seems you're doing okay. I heard that recently you almost killed a couple of my brother's boys. Him, mo. What'll we do? You want to come join us? You'll do all right in our world. In five years you'll have your own gang. You won't regret it. Regardless of that adoring woman, an honest life doesn't suit you. Isn't that right, Hayama? This is good, opens the pores. Huh... Huh? Huh?! Yukie... What is it, Boss? Well, would... Well would? Well, would... well, would... you marry me? Sorry it's so sudden, but I'm sincere. This place isn't great, there's not much money, but Yukie, I'll always treat you better than him. I promise, okay? Boss... That guy's not right for you. He's really a... yakuza! That's not true! Now he leads a respectable life. Is that really true? Did something happen? Does that guy... Does he really adore you? Say he loves you? Yukie, you want happiness, right? You will be happy with me. I promise. I promise you happiness. So we'll... So we'll... So we'll kiss! Yukie! The fact is that Yukie is assigned to this man. Hey, you! Hey, you! This Yukie belongs just to me! Look at this, her name card. I don't know who you are, but today I came all the way from Azerbaijan. It's a special day for me so I can choose. My Yukie is reserved for only me. What's with the weepy face? Can you really understand how I feel? Gentlemen, please! You shouldn't fight over me. A threesome! Police! What's going on?! Boss, want a refill? A "refill"? Some more rice. I see, just a bit. Just a bit. A bit, a bit. Just a bit. Where you from? A bit, just a bit. Here, don't spill it. Well, about last night... Yes? I drank too much, so don't remember much. Me too. When I came around I found I'd spent the night here. Isn't the miso soup too salty? No, it's good. But that's not what I meant. When you're done eating, can you leave? It's my place. I'll get more miso soup. Thank you. Good morning. Yukie, you showed up! About yesterday, I'm really sorry, so sorry. Boss, eat while it's hot. Yukie?! Yukie. Eighteen years... What? Yukie! - Stay away! - What's up? What's up! Bastard! Yukie and you... What did you do?! Boss, this man is my father. I'm her father. Her father?! Father. Did you fall? “Closed” Father, why did you come here? I wanted to go to see UFJ. It's actually 'USJ," sir. And I wondered how you're doing. That's a pack of lies. You came here to steal money. Money?! Pi... Pitiless! Don't call your true father a thief. I served my time and got out yesterday. Those are mine. Huh?! Out of jail! Anyway, stay away from my place. I live with someone. That mug hm'? He's nothing! He makes you work so hard in this lousy place. Sunset?! It faces west! That proves it's poor. So poor! Sunset? It's still morning. Why don't you leave that thug and come live here? Lousy little dump. Dump?! - Father! - Yukie. I'm sorry to have caused you so much suffering. That's why... I want you to have... the happiness... that other... people can have. That's what I wanted... what I wanted. That's what I wanted. Like other people. But why... why am I crying... Oh, how beautiful. Congratulations! The first win on machine 316! Sends chills up your spine! Super fever! Really is super fever! You finally hit it big! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! Please stop now, you'll bankrupt us. Congratulations, it's your third month. Look, it's smiling, it's smiling! It's smiling clearly at this stage. It has a mole on the side of its nose, just like its mother. Hey, Yukie! Darling, you're so drunk again! Sorry to trouble all of you. What are you doing here?! Hey, bring me everything on the menu. Huh?! One of everything on the menu. We're closing, but mainly, where's the money? Money? No problem. He won 60 consecutive games at pachinko. His photo will be in the papers tomorrow! My goodness! Customers? Boss, customers are like gods to us, let's take their order. Third crap today, just keeps coming. Nobody cares? You haven't met? It's okay. Father doesn't need to know. You're him? You're Isao, the thug that's taking money from my daughter? What's with those eyes? I'm Yukie's father. Yukie's father? That's great. How nice! - What's with you guys? - Darling, drink this. Sober up real fast, I have something to say! You too, Father, sit down and listen. Listen carefully. What? What? Didn't say yet! I'm going to... have a baby. It's not true! Do you mean it? That's good news. It's a lie! Y Bu! You did it, bastard! Stop that noise! Darling... Nothing to say? Well... aren't you happy? Of course he is! It doesn't show, but he loves kids. He'll be a great daddy. Y Bu! A thug like you isn't good enough to be a father. Come back! He's important, what does he say? I thought he'd be a bit happy... Sorry to say, sometimes women have to decide not to have it, and sometimes it's decided they shouldn't become mothers. But it's an admirable role. Babies can't choose their parents. It's a crime to make babies suffer. Hey, Hayama. Have you decided to join us'! Your old man was a first-rate gangster. Too bad that fate decided he would die young, but if he'd lived maybe his gang would have surpassed mine. Listen, Hayama. There's first-class yakuza blood flowing in your veins. Your abilities don't suit the respectable world. The yakuza world is where you belong. So... you should decide. 'Smile and Give Birth” Welcome home. I was just reading up. There are so many things I don't know. Hey... Why won't you say anything? Have it, or don't have it. At least say something. It's your child. If you won't say anything... I'll leave you. “Father's Role in Birth“ Get out. Don't go. Darling... To my dear Mother... Should I give birth to this child? Morita? Ms. Yukie Morita, are you okay? Ms. Morita, Ms. Morita, can you hear me? Are you okay? Ms. Morita? It's terrible! It's terrible! It's terrible! At this critical time you loaf around?! Yukie fell from an overpass, she's unconscious! Yukie? Your beloved wife and your child are dying! Tamai Hospital! Ms. Morita. Ms. Morita. Hurry, hurry! One, two, three. Mother, is this your answer? Morita. And also there's Kumamoto. What's that?! Both forgot to bring the materials fee again? You both get this month's non-payment reward. Keep on collecting. Okay, until you pay you have to clean toilets. Toilet cleaning again! What a stink! Too poor! Please stop that everyone! They're pitiful. Quiet down! Today I'll tell you where our tuna comes from. It's from Africa, that's far from here... Morita, why are you hiding your lunch? You are too, Kumamoto. It's desperate. Then don't ask. You“ Pour! You“ Pour! You're poor! Let's go. Are you okay? It's okay. Hey, get back inside. See you. See you later. Don't be so noisy. Be quiet! There's a saying that 'All are equal under heaven." So even the poorest people are equal and have rights... If I could be reborn, I'd like to be just like Fujisawa. She's pretty and smart, she's rich and smells like a flower. If that's how you feel, go and join her. Ouch! Yukie, today I have a surprise announcement for you. I'm surprised before telling! Again, my announcement. Your father is getting remarried, to her. Miwako will be your new mother! I'm Miwako! You're Yukiko? She's Yukie, Yukie. Oh, Yukie. I finished junior high, so... What's that?! If you need help studying, don't hesitate to ask me. You really are pretty. Morita, will you eat with us? I'm so grateful. Go ahead! I'm so grateful. Morita is so cute! You're too poor! I'm finished with you. Miwako, don't say such a thing. But ever since I was young I've dreamed about my wedding. You can't even give me a diamond engagement ring. Can't we just register as a couple? Of course not. It faces west! You're so poor! I want a hotel wedding in a wedding dress and three changes of clothes. The honeymoon will be to coconut Hawaii. Hawaii, coconut. Actually, the moon isn't made of honey... We can't afford a house, so a leased apartment is fine. A big, beautiful place overlooking Kesennuma Bay. It'll have a lovely bathroom, with just the two of us living there. Miwako, you mean I have to give up Yukie? Who is more important to you, Yukie or me? Tell me clearly! - But I... - Tell me. Poor! - Don't torment me... - Too poor! - Don't torment me... - Too poor! The money! Hawaii Father! Yukie, abandoned by your mother. No delivery from tomorrow. Too poor! Now what?! you do? Pitiful. She may die. She'll die, she'll die. There's nothing between you, your father and I. Long ago, abandoned by your mother. Too poor! Kumamoto, thank you. We can be friends forever from now on, right? What do you mean, friends?! You betrayed me! That's 15 slaps. You have nothing to say? Kumamoto, I'm sorry. 16 slaps! 17 slaps! Will you say sorry for your whole life? You'll let me just keep hitting you? You think we'll stay friends if you're so weak? I've had enough of hitting, why not hit me back?! Don't run from your fate. Kumamoto?! Kumamoto'! Kumamoto, you've got to pull through. Kumamoto! You can't die! If you die, I'll have nobody! Let's be friends our whole lives. Friends forever! You mean that? I mean it, I'll never betray you. Morita, give me your hand. Whether we are near or far, I will never forget you. Whether we are near or far, I will never forget you. Whether happy or sad, we will remain friends. We'll always be friends. Whether happy or sad, we will remain friends. We'll always be friends. Do you want to find happiness? Yeah, even a bit is fine. I want to feel happy. You can be. Is that true? Just leave this town. But you can't ever come back. If you really try, you can change that poor face. And then you may become happy. Then I'll be alone again. Idiot, we said that no matter how far apart, we'll be friends. I can't stop the bleeding. HP dropping from 10 to 8. Shock from blood loss! Doctor! Next stop, Momoura Station. Ku... Kumamoto?! Morita, eat this. I don't need it, Kumamoto, your lunch isn't good. You don't need to eat it, take it with you. I don't really want to go to Tokyo! Idiot! Kumamoto! Good-bye. Don't give up, Morita. Morita, don't give up! Kumamoto! Don't give up, find your happiness. Isao... “SURGERY” You can't! Yukie! Yukie! Stop now. In utero bleeding... We might lose the baby. Another ultrasound. The UFJ Bank. Is it a good bank? Good deposit interest. Where is it? Come over here! Let's have fun. How about three juicy fruits? Go back to Russia. You make me sick. Addict! Foreigner! Matryoshka dolls! Caviar! Hey... Borscht! Hey, hey! You... You'll do anything for 1,000 yen? I'm not 1,000 yen! I'm 10,000 yen. That's too much for an addict like you. Old jerk! Ouch! Apologize. What?! Go ahead, apologize to her! Let go of me! You're only worth 500 yen! I'll take the three of you. All of us! You again? We Pay your gang fee. You're always interfering. What's going on? Maybe you... want to buy my services? If you're just looking, get out of here! I really... you. Huh? I really... you. What? I can't hear. I really love you. Don't joke around. Think I'm stupid 'cause I'm a hooker? That was great! That was great! You know him? Yakuza? Matrix? I don't know him. Mr. Company Boss! I'm just a clerk... - Come again, Boss! - I'll be back. Give me a break, you are an addict. I can't do it. Enough of this! Stop making fun of me! I'm not making fun of you. I really love you. Is that so? All right... If you actually do love me, you can have me for money. You can have me if you pay. You're my customer. What are you doing? What's good about me? Everything. Everything about you. Let's leave here and go far away. Are you some kind of idiot? Idiot, idiot! Are you an idiot?! Go back to Russia. Stop that, stop that! Ouch! Stop that! Go back to Russia! Stop that! Mother! Mother! Yukie! Yukie! What happened to your finger? I wanted to make myself clean... before meeting you. Let's come again... to the sea. For luck. I talked to your father and we decided on your name. It means 'may happiness be yours.“ Since you're a girl, it? "Yukie. ' You like it? It's a great name! Right, Yukie? Mother'! For a longtime you were not aware of it, but you are loved... by many people. Look, just open your eyes. Bleeding has stopped. Good. Vital signs stable. Doctor... Come... Yukie. Did you have a nightmare? No. I had a happy dream. Father... Yes? I just met with Mother. She was beautiful. Really? Darling... Yukie. I'm sorry to have worried you. Let's go... to the sea, all three of us. You mean...'I I can have the baby? The sea... But don't... steal a car to go. Idiot. To my dear Mother, maybe there is no happiness or unhappiness in this world. Really? You don't accept... Whenever you get something, you lose something. Whenever you discard something, you acquire something. For example, what happens if the one thing that's most precious to you, that important thing becomes lost? We run around crying out loud and are horrified, but does that thing really decide our happiness or unhappiness? What about cleaning and preparation? Our sales fell a lot this month! Hello, sir. I was waiting for you. Come here! Losing that which is most precious means acquiring, totally and forever, that which is most precious. I realized that. My shop is being taken over. Mother, when I was a child I lost your love. Yes. Koharu, you're really beautiful! And then, I became confused and desperately looked for love. I wanted to be loved. Right now it's 243 thousand yen. It's worth 1.2 million yen. A real deal! Name seal, please... But just at that moment, I found it in my own heart. As if I'd simply opened the hand I'd been grasping it in. That's how it seemed... Yukie... Mother, from now on whatever happens, I won't be afraid. I'm filled with courage. Mother, I'd like to meet you sometime. And then, Mother, I'll say I've always loved you. May a healthy child be born. Make it stop! Sincerely, Yukie Hayama. P.S. I loo will soon give birth to a child. The precious life that was saved by everyone... will soon be born. To my dear Mother... Hello, Hayama here. What?! Kumamoto?! It can't be! That same Kumamoto! It's been so long! Really?! Okay... I understand. I'm on my way, just wait. Here it is! Darling, I'm going out. Kumamoto is here. Her husband has been transferred from Dubai. She's at the airport. Sorry, can you skip lunch today? I want Kumamoto to eat this. I'm leaving. Wait a minute. For luck. Thank you. I'm off. Okay. 'FAREWELL ' So many of them! With thanks. Kumamoto? Morita? Long, long time no see. Nothing's changed? Directed by Yukihiko Tsutsumi Happiness or unhappiness doesn't matter. They both have the same worth. There clearly is meaning in life. ©2007 HAPPILY EVER AFTER FILM PARTNERS
