WEDNESDAY 3:30 PM I am so sorry, Mr. Daniels. Forgive me. I shouldn't be texting and walking. - Nothing broken. . Sorry. Again, it was lovely to meet you, Tess. I'm excited to play a part in making history. I'm excited to make it with you. All right, have a great day. You too. Okay, well, I'll see you next week. Thank you. BB, parking garage, level one, please. Parking garage, level one selected. BB, parking garage, level one. BB, what are you doing? Level one, please. Thank you. BB, stop. BB, stop! BB, stop! BB, stop! CROSSWORD MYSTERIES Terminal Descent SIX HOURS EARLIER - Done. - Two minutes and 13 seconds. Okay, not bad. Not bad? That's amazing. But, can I solve a puzzle faster than a super-computer? And that's the question. Kasparov versus Deep Blue at chess. Jennings and Rutter versus Watson on Jeopardy! No wins for humanity to be found. That's why my money's on BB. Well, thank you so much for the vote of confidence, Frank. "BB"? It's XCAL Communications' supercomputer. BigBrain X. BB, for short. I don't know. I think Tess has got something going for her - other people don't. - And what's that? - She's a woman. ! An excellent point. Have you met my brilliant new assistant? I have not. Frank Lam. Frank's the Sentinel's tech reporter. He's writing a piece about the exhibition. Sonia Robinson. Nice Piaget. Altiplano with the alligator strap, right? Yeah. Thanks. It was a gift. Please. That thing's like a Rolls Royce for your wrist. I... I used to work at the jewellery department at Saks. Sonia's been helping me out since Josephine left for grad school. Speaking of which, do you think you'd be able to pull together some research for computer and tech jargon? I feel like it'll be fun to tie in a week of technology-inspired puzzles - to go along with the exhibition. - You got it. Thanks. - Pleasure to meet you. - Yeah, you too. I got to go. Just enough time to see my aunt and go meet the competition. Right. Good luck. You're gonna need it. Thanks, Frank. Did you hear that? Sorry. So you're the youngest of five? - With four older brothers. - Wow. And you came over here from the 112th? Yeah. I was working Robbery the last five years. Good for you. Well, let me be the first to welcome you. Thank you. You know, when they told me we were going to get another detective here at the precinct, I was hoping it wasn't a green newbie. Yeah, you don't seem like the hand-holding type. Patience isn't really one of my virtues. Logan, get in here! Or your father's, apparently. Yeah, yeah. He... he struggles with that, too. What's the emergency, Pop? Trying to order a file from Records. Can't make heads or tails of this new computer system the brass has put in. - Are you kidding me? - No. This coming from you, a guy that can recall details on cases 20 years ago. And you're sitting here telling me you're having problems with a few clicks of a mouse? All right. Well, if you are, move aside. And let the young man help the old man. Is that your file number right there? - Yeah. - Watch this. Boom, done. You'll have it in an hour. - Wait, that's it? - Yup. - Well, thank you. - You're welcome. Used to be a time when you could pick up the phone, talk to an actual human being, and get exactly what you need. Yeah, well, Pop, this is way more efficient. Come on, who says? I don't know, what was her name? Everyone. Maybe, I don't know... maybe I should consider just hanging it up. Old dogs, new tricks, ya know? Remember when you used to always tell me that texting was impossible? Now all I get from you, Pop, are emojis. Come on, are you kidding me? If you retired, you'd be so bored out of your mind, you'd be begging the Commissioner for your badge back. I'd give it a week, tops. - And you know it. - Maybe you're right. You know I'm right. You got plenty of tricks left, believe me. Hey, how was the opera? I enjoyed what I saw. What, did you leave early or something? I fell asleep. The overture started and I was out like a light. I can't remember the last time I made it through an entire performance. You've had season tickets for a decade. I know. I don't know why I keep renewing them. I guess I thought that's what people my age do for fun. "People your age" can do whatever they want. You're right. I need to shake things up. I need to find something new, or try something... Something that doesn't make you fall asleep. Exactly. I feel like I need a bit of fun, too. You know, between all these deadlines, and the Crossword Club newsletter, and the Sentinel's charity gala that I offered to help plan, I... I've just been all work, no play. Well, when you give everything to everyone, you leave nothing for yourself, honey. Yeah. Things will slow down after next week. So what's next week? I'm competing in a crossword exhibition against a supercomputer. You're kidding? - Well, at least your work's not boring. - Nope. Tess! Hey! Thanks again for agreeing to be a part of the exhibition. Absolutely. And reminding me how long I spent on your couch when I first moved to the city, it was kind of hard to argue with. And when I brought the whole thing up with my editor, she... well, she wasn't going to let me say no. Well, free publicity is the best publicity. Yes. Spoken like the true queen of public relations. This is just incredible. And we're expanding, too. Morgan bought the building next door, and we're planning to cut the ribbon this spring. That's... that's really impressive. This is pretty cool, too. Check this out. Coming to work here is like walking into a science-fiction movie. - Hey, BB. - Hello, Viv. Second floor, please. - Second floor selected. - Okay, that is pretty neat. And when you're leaving, P1 for the subway. Amazing. Come on. I wanted to introduce you to our vice president. And there he is. Okay, great. - Tess, this is Paul Redford. - Hi. Paul, Tess Harper. When Viv said she got the crossword editor of the Sentinel to participate, we were delighted. Well, I just can't believe you've created a computer that understands the nuances of crossword puzzle clues. Brainchild of our CEO, Morgan Daniels. Yeah, the guy's a... well, the guy's a genius. And not one of those people you just say is a genius, he's an actual genius. Can I give Tess the nickel tour? Go for it. Tess? I will see you before you leave. Okay, sounds good. So have you been with XCAL long? Almost seven years of blood, sweat and tears. XCAL is everywhere, though. I mean, every time a computer boots up at the Sentinel, - we see your logo. - Yeah, we're holding our own. And if Morgan's right with his design, well, the world's going to be one step closer to having an AI system that can learn, adapt and behave with the same unique subtleties and quirks as human beings. Something our Board of Directors will be pretty delighted to hear. You know, considering the expense and patience they've shown. That's where the sweat comes in, right? Yeah, and the tears. So... how'd you like to meet it? Say hello to Tess Harper, BB. She's going to be your competition. It's nice to meet you, Tess Harper. Hi. You wanna test it with some puzzle clues? And how exactly would I do that? We took some voice clips of yours that were online and input them into the computer's voice-recognition system. - Wow. - Just ask away. All right... Cardiac blaze, nine letters. Heartburn. Okay, very good. Maybe we'll try something a little harder. Deck of cards, major and minor suits. Five letters. Tarot. Is it okay if I back out of the exhibition, or? Yeah, you do and we'll cancel our Sentinel subscription. Okay, well, just promise me if my editor offers BB my job, you'll decline. Deal. Okay. Just try... Morgan would hate to miss getting to say hi to you. - So, I'll be right back. - Sure. Is this a... ficus lyrata? What? Or did I just get that wrong? You know, a fiddle-leaf fig. Yeah, a fiddle-leaf. Right. Well, it's... it's beautiful. It's one of my favorites. Tess? Morgan Daniels, Tess Harper. You have created something so impressive here, Mr. Daniels. Thank you. That's very nice of you to say. - Do you mind if I ask you a question? - Yeah, shoot. Of all the games and puzzle possibilities that you could have chosen, why crossword puzzles? My father. About the only time I ever remember him being content was while he was settled into his favorite chair, the newspaper folded just so, while he filled in his crossword. And I bet he used a pen. He wouldn't think of using a pencil. Morgan? Can I talk to you for a sec? You can't go through with the government bid. Look, they're going to turn BigBrain X into Big Brother on steroids. Please, not now, Jesse. I know that you have to... make sure that the Board knows we can monetize the technology, but this isn't the way. If you'll excuse us for one moment. Let's talk over here for a minute. I hear what you're saying, Jesse... You know, I wanted to ask you, since my voice is in your system, can I do that cool trick I saw Viv do with the elevator? Yeah, you can. In fact, you could also set off the alarm systems if you wanted to. But please don't. Well, only in case of emergency. Yeah, we appreciate you being on board. For what we're hoping will be a historic match between woman and machine. No pressure. I am, um, so sorry, Mr. Daniels. Forgive me. I shouldn't be texting and walking. - Are you okay? - Nothing broken. I'm sorry. Again, it was lovely to meet you, Tess. I'm excited to play a part in making history. Well, I'm excited to make it with you. All right, have a great day. You too. Well, I better take off, because tomorrow's puzzle waits for no one. Okay, well, I'll see you next week. - Thank you. - All right, bye. Hey, Tess. I'll send you an email with all the details. - Thanks so much, Viv. - Okay. Morgan, could you just... Could you... BB, parking garage, level one, please. Parking garage, level one selected. BB, stop. BB, stop! What was that? I don't know. Okay, thanks. So since when did Queens become part of our jurisdiction? Well, the Mayor put in a call in to the lieutenant, requested the detective with the highest clearance rate. That'd be you. And since Winston's out on vacation and Queens is kind of my old stomping ground, your father thought it might make sense that we partner up on this one. Well, lucky me. So I take it our victim had some pull. Tech titan named Morgan Daniels. I'm sure he made more than a few friends Downtown. - Is he the only fatality? - Yeah. All right, was anything... Did anything look disturbed? Wires cut or anything like that? No. But the elevator's a "Smart" elevator, so it's connected to a centralized network. If it was so smart, it should've known when to stop? Yeah. Well, the safety protocols that would prevent something like this from happening were overridden, and they didn't engage, so we got Computer Crimes checking out that system now. Okay, good. Well, let's let Computer Crimes do their thing, check the ones and zeroes of it all. Let's head upstairs and have a chat with XCAL, - shall we? - Yeah. Take the stairs? Well, we're not taking this. Tess. Logan. Hey. What're you doing here? I had a meeting, and then the crash happened. What are you doing here? Well, we are looking into the cause of the elevator malfunction, so. What... It wasn't just an accident? Well, I mean, it's a little too early to tell, but... Speaking of, anything... worth mentioning that you're... Not really. Unless you consider the person servicing the plants not knowing the genus or species of a fiddle-leaf fig worth mentioning. Yeah, no. That's what I figured. All right, I'll... I'll let you get to it. It suits you, though, the... the new haircut. Not that the old one didn't. I mean... Just... You... you look good. Thanks. It's good to see you. You too. Who's that? That is Tess Harper. She's a... she's a friend. Listen, I need you to start interviewing some of these employees, okay? I'm going to head upstairs and chat with the VP? Yeah. Sounds like a plan. So you're saying you've never had an issue with your elevator? Never. Well, all we've determined so far is that the safety protocols, they just simply didn't engage. Well, someone would have to make those changes to the system. It wouldn't just decide to stop. Okay, and how difficult would it be to do that? Only one person had access to make those kinds of changes to our AI system's code. Let me guess, Morgan. It kind of puts your company in a tough spot, doesn't it? I mean, without Morgan... your system's inaccessible. It's something that's going to be very hard to explain to the Board. Morgan valued control. You know, and the power that control gave him. Right. But without him, there may not be an XCAL anyway. Could someone else have gotten a hold of Morgan's password, and made changes that way? I mean, he could've been hacked, sure. But someone would have to physically be at a computer terminal in this office to make the necessary alternations to the system. Yeah? Why's that? After a few attempts to penetrate the network from the outside, Morgan designed a cyber-security barrier. You know, works like a moat around a castle. Unless you were on our side of the drawbridge... You will not have access to it. Exactly. Okay. You think someone may've done this to Morgan on purpose? It's a little too early to say, but, I appreciate your information. Thank you. I should call Patricia. You know, tell her the news. - Who's Patricia? - His wife. Well, Paul, don't worry. I'm sure we can handle that. Excuse me. I know this might seem like an odd question, but... how many people does that company have working in this building? Why do you wanna know? Someone wearing that same uniform gave me some great advice on taking care of my bamboo palm, and I... I... I just forgot to ask how much I should be watering it. Had to be Steve, he's the only one that services the building. - Steve. - Excuse me. Yeah. Thank you. Hey. Yeah, I figured you'd already left by now. I just found something out. You going to tell me or do you want me to guess? This is usually the part where you tell me to stay out of things. - Have you ever listened? - No. Okay, so I've learned to pick my battles. Come on, what is it? Right before Morgan got on the elevator, I had a quick conversation with someone who was servicing the plants. The guy that didn't know the genus and species? Yeah, exactly, and I just thought that was kind of odd considering it's his job. Tess, not everybody knows every minute detail about everything like you do. Well, it's basic information. Okay. If you say so. Anyway, I just saw someone over there wearing the same exact uniform, but the security guard said that only one person from that company services this building. And it wasn't the guy you were talking to? No. And he... I don't know, something was just off. He seemed kind of nervous, and... right when I started talking to him, he was, like, digging around in the soil, like he was trying to hide something. - Okay. Show me. - It's right here. Plant? Is that a bug? Looks like this office has an infestation. "This is Computer Crimes. We've confirmed the elevator's safety protocols were purposefully altered." - What? - Yeah. And that officially now makes Morgan Daniels' death a homicide, Tess. But I thought it was an accident? Well, someone somehow got into your guys' security system and intentionally overrode the safety protocols. But I also wanted to ask you about your voice-recognition system on your elevator. Can your computer decipher between one voice and another? Well, if their voice has been input into the computer's memory, then yeah. So your computer system would have known that Morgan was on the elevator. Okay. Do you guys know if he had any threats made against him? We have had a few emails and calls over the years, but nothing that caused any concern. I'm going to need a list of all your employees here at the company. - I can put that together for you. - Great. Thanks. We also found this listening device in one of your planters. I'm sure there's more all over the office. Do you have any idea who might want to bug the office? Eisner Industries. Our main rival. They weren't above trying to get inside information. Hiring our former employees. Multiple attempts to penetrate our security network. Corporate espionage is a huge concern in the tech world. You think they'd be desperate enough to take out the competition? I'd like to think that they weren't... but maybe. Well, whoever planted this bug, I'm pretty sure had access to a computer terminal. Could've gotten into our network to alter the elevator's safety protocols. Based off of Tess's tip, we pulled a screen-grab from the office's security footage. Let's run it through facial recognition, - maybe we'll get lucky and get an ID. - All right. So you were there when the elevator crashed? Yeah. If Morgan had heard me ask him to hold the door, I wouldn't be here. Anyway, needless to say, they, they've canceled the exhibition. Well, since Reed is knee-deep on a piece about serial robberies in the Diamond District, Delevante has asked me to cover the investigation, so any firsthand details you've got, I'd appreciate it. A person of interest in the case disguised himself as someone servicing the office plants. - That's interesting. - Yeah. And I can tell you, he didn't know the first thing about plants. - You spoke to him? - Yes. And then he kind of disappeared after everything happened, but... Logan O'Connor, one of the detectives, is trying to ID him. Is there anything about him you can remember? He looked a little rough around the edges, you know, longish hair, scruffy beard, and... Yeah, a fiddle-leaf. Right. He had a tattoo on his forearm! I can't believe I forgot to mention that to Logan. Well, what was the tattoo of? It was a wolf, howling. Yeah, it was howling wolf. Could be military, maybe? Any of these? No. None of those match. All right, I'm trying "Howling wolves" now. Maybe it's a sports team? That's it. Howlin' Wolves Motorcycle Club, New York City. It's the same as his tattoo! If plant guy is a member of the motorcycle club... Maybe someone there can identify him. I'm going to check it out. All right, thanks. - Hey. - Hey. No hit on facial recognition. Okay, were they able to pull a print from the bug? No luck there either. Great. for-two, then. Yeah. Hey, Tess. What's up? Hey, Logan. Listen, I... I remembered something about the plant guy. - He had a tattoo. - Okay, that's good. We can run that through the system. That's fine. You know, I looked it up and the tattoo is an exact match of the logo to a motorcycle club called the Howlin' Wolves. Okay, Tess. Please tell me you're not - where I think you are. - I'm at the Wolves' clubhouse now. Okay, listen to me very carefully, Tess. These guys are not choir boys, all right? They're very dangerous people. - I'll call you later. - Tess! That's good. Yeah, just hung up on me. Is your friend in trouble? Yeah. In more ways than one. I'll... I'll call you! I'll be back. Who the heck is that? You lost, honey? - This is a private club. - Right. Well, tell whoever the owner of that Harley-Davidson Dyna Super Glide that they have got a beautiful bike. I mean, that Arlen Ness fairing is just... wow, it's perfection. That's my ride. You know your bikes, lady. Yeah, my uncle used to take me for rides on his Softail during the summer growing up. You know what, maybe you can help me with something. I'm looking for someone. It's a guy who has a tattoo on his left forearm of the club's logo. He's got kind of longish hair, scruffy beard... I know a lotta people match that description. Are any of the club's members in these photographs? Maybe. That's him. This is the guy I'm talking about. That's Eric. Why're you looking for him? I... And then when my aunt gave my uncle the pig she got him for his birthday, he said, "Well, that wasn't the kind of hog I was thinking of." Tess? Hey, this is a private club, man. Hey, Logan. You know this guy? Yeah. He's a friend. She makes them everywhere she goes, it seems. You know what, I don't get to talk motorcycles often. This was fun. Well, if ever you get an itchin' for a ride, you gimme a holler. All right, and thanks for the information, Hammer. Anytime. Okay, see you guys later. - Bye. - Let's go. You know, I really can't do my job if I'm worried about you getting yourself in trouble - all the time. - Logan, I can take care of myself. - Really? - Yeah. And I got the plant guy's first name. - You did? - Yeah. Eric. Okay, you know, that's... that's good, since we didn't get a hit on facial recognition. Amrita, hey. Do me a favor. Run a list of all the Howlin' Wolves MC club members for me. First name "Eric." Thanks. You know, your friend, Hammer, back there? How d'you think he got his nickname? - He works in construction, right? - No. More like felony assault. Yeah. With a hammer. I arrested him back when I was in patrol. - Really? - Yeah. He seems so nice. He seems nice? Real... Yes. You got an address? All right. Bye. I'm leaving now. You're welcome! - Eric Ogden? - Yeah? I'd like to ask you a few questions. Turn around. You know who doesn't run? Innocent people. So we found the plant company's uniform in your van, but when we called the company, they confirmed you don't work for them. As a matter of fact, you've never worked for them. So why don't you tell me who hired you to plant those listening devices at XCAL? You think this whole silent routine is gonna play, pal? I've got you on criminal trespassing, illegal surveillance equipment, and I can even throw in intellectual property theft if I'd like. But here's the cherry on top, Eric. I've got you on conspiracy to commit murder. Murder? - What murder? - The murder of Morgan Daniels. The CEO of XCAL Technologies. You see, Eric, someone tampered with that elevator. And Morgan Daniels dropped 30 floors to his death, around the exact same time you were skulking in that office. I don't know anything about that. Well, you better start telling me who hired you, or you're going to be looking at a few years to a lifetime behind bars. Eisner Industries hired me to get information on the projects XCAL's developing. Okay, how long have you been planting listening devices at XCAL? - A week. - A week? I got bills to pay. Someone wants a job done, I do it. And how much do you charge for murder? You were in the office. It would have been really easy for you to change the computer code, and you know it. I didn't go anywhere near a keyboard in that office. Really? Check the security camera footage if you don't believe me. I will. I will. In the meantime, I'd like you to give me those audio files you compiled from the listening devices. You'll tell the DA that I played nice and cooperated? You start doing that, maybe I will. The audio's downloaded directly to a hard-drive in my apartment. Good, now we're getting somewhere. You ready to go? Yeah, let me just grab my stuff. - All right. - I really appreciate you offering to introduce me to your friend, Viviane. Yeah, of course. She'll get you in front of anyone at XCAL who wants to talk. You know, it's been interesting digging into the history of XCAL. Morgan started the company at MIT, with his friend, Gregory Sackett. I don't think I met him when I was there. Nah, you wouldn't have, because as soon as they launched their first operating system, Morgan booted him out of the company. Right before XCAL went public. Sackett left the tech world behind and went into teaching. So, what do you think caused Morgan to get rid of his partner like that? Maybe Morgan wanted the glory and money all to himself. So Sackett could have a couple hundred million reasons to hold a grudge against his old partner. Security footage just confirmed Eric's story. He never was near a computer. - Not our murderer, then. - Apparently not. Maybe the audio from the surveillance picked up something else. I got unis en route to Eric's apartment to grab the drives. Did you get anything on the XCAL employee background checks? So far, no red flags. What about Tess's friend. What's her name... Viviane Banks? Record's clean. Great relationship with Morgan. Doesn't seem to have coding skills either. This is bothering me, though. Paul Redford said something earlier. He said that Morgan was the only person that would have access to make changes to the AI system. Doesn't that seem odd to you? Yeah. Wouldn't give the company a lot of options - if something happened to him. - Right? I mean, you have this successful company like XCAL, you want to see it last a long time, even after you were gone. It just doesn't... make any sense... Did Jesse Alexander call you? - No. Nothing yet. - Wonderful. I mean, we do know that she's XCAL's lead coder, so, hopefully, when we talk to her, she can tell us who Morgan gave access to. Or if she had access, she definitely has the know-how to alter the safety protocols. That's a very good point. Very good point. Which means I think she's, due for a special visit. What's going on in there? The Commissioner doesn't make house calls. He's been with your dad for the last 30 minutes. It looks serious. What is it? No, I just, Chauncey's floating the idea of retiring. Well, he's put his time in. Why not enjoy the rest life has to offer? Retirement's all my dad talks about. Well, unfortunately, Chauncey would be lost without this job. Looks like your dad's made up his mind. Jesse? It's Detective O'Connor, NYPD. I just wanted to ask you a few questions. Excuse me. Have you seen anyone go in or out of apartment four? Saw her leave a few hours ago. Had a duffle bag with her. She in some sort of trouble? Listen, if you see her again, have her call me. Detective Logan O'Connor, NYPD, at that number, okay? Great. Thanks, brother. Appreciate it. Don't you have an office to work in? Hello there. - Hello. - Hi. I brought Frank to meet Viv, because he's doing a story for the paper, and I have a puzzle due in two hours, and I'm nowhere near finished. Well, that's what I admire about you most, Tess, you always put other people before yourself. Well, my aunt would probably argue that I'm spreading myself too thin. Hey, is there... is there any update on the case? Well, Eric Ogden is not our guy, unfortunately, so I figured I'd circle back to XCAL, have a chat with some of the employees, see if they can guide me to figure out where Jesse Alexander disappeared to. You think she's on the run? It made me pull her credit card records, phone, and she hasn't used either one of them after Morgan's death. We've also got a BOLO out for her, so if she wants to skip town on a bus, or train, or a plane, we'll find her. Maybe she's uneasy about her last interaction with Morgan. What do you mean? Well, she definitely didn't agree with him putting in a bid on the government contract. - Did it get heated? - No. It was just awkward. Well, she definitely left her apartment. With a duffle bag. Now, I don't know about you, Tess, but that's not exactly the kind of behavior, when you skip out of town, of someone filled with regret. So... But it's always nice to see you give people the benefit of the doubt. Now, I mean, if I didn't, you and I wouldn't be friends. What? What are you talking... What do you mean? You saying I don't make a good first impression? I'm saying that you, you know... - you grow on people. - I grow on people! Wow! So, I'm like fungus now. You really know how to flatter a guy, Tess, thank you. Yeah, that's a better way to say it. No, what I mean is, I think you... I think you put up a tough act to keep people at arm's length. You know what... I don't know about you, but I'm a people person. Detective O'Connor? - Yeah. - Hi. Frank Lam, with the Sentinel. I would love to get a quote from you about the investigation, if you've got a second. Yeah, you can just put my usual down. Okay. Which is? "No comment." You know, Tess warned me about you, - and I still walked right into that one. - Yes, you did. Thanks for your time, Ms. Banks. Take care. - Come on in. - Yeah. No, I don't know who he spoke to. Absolutely not. What's all that about? Paul's on with the Board. Apparently, Eisner Industries made an offer on the company. Really? Didn't waste any time, did they? Sharks smell the blood in the water. Let me guess. Paul doesn't wanna sell. It's a hard case to make, considering we had to pull the bid on the government contract. - Why's that? - All the work for the project was on Morgan's personal hard-drive. Took it everywhere he went. It's probably in a thousand pieces at the bottom of the elevator shaft. Which is a tragedy, since that contract could've netted the company a fortune. Well, I don't want to make any promises, but I'll talk to the crime scene people, see if they can keep their eyes out at the scene. Maybe we'll get lucky, you know? - That'd be amazing. - All right. - Sorry, Detective. I've got to run. - Yeah, that's fine. Thanks. Hey, what's up? You got 'em? All of 'em? That's fantastic. Okay, listen, I'm on my way. Someone's stepping off the clutch too quickly. How can you tell? My dad gave me driving lessons on a stick shift, and the sound of one stalling is forever seared into my mind. Viv. Hi. Do you need some help? Morgan's wife asked if someone could drive his car back to their house. Thought a task might be a nice distraction from everything. Didn't realize it would be a manual transmission when I volunteered. Well, I drive stick, if you don't mind the company? You're the best. I'll meet you back at the office. You know, I... saw you with the Commissioner earlier. Yeah. Something going on? Yeah, You remember Lieutenant Hanna? Yeah, I know, of course. You guys came up through the Academy together. Dropped dead last night at his desk. Heart attack. Pop, I'm sorry. You know, Jimmy never got his gold watch. Never got the recognition he deserved for putting in so many years on the job. You know? Last time I talked to him, he was... so excited about spending his retirement spoiling his grandkids. - Listen Pop, I'm sorry. You... - Excuse me, guys. - Yeah. - I don't mean to interrupt, but, there's a problem with the audio files. What are you... what are you talking about? - What kind of problem? - It's empty. Erased, more than likely. Do you think Ogden is playing us? No. I mean, come on, Pop, he told us where the files were. It doesn't make any sense. Our killer's cleaning up after themselves. Yeah. So... You're positive there was audio on those files? Yeah. I checked before I went back to the XCAL offices. Do you have any backup copies? How many people at Eisner Industries know what you were up to? Only the person who hired me. And who might that be? Eric, remember all the nice things I said to the DA about you? Well, they can easily be unsaid. Keith Eisner. The CEO? He and I go back to grade school, man. He needs stuff done off the books, he comes to me. Was there anything on those audio files he might not want the world to hear? It was mostly techy business talk and employees blabbering about the weekend. What about arguments? Anything of that nature that might implicate Eisner? No. You know, Eric, the DA's office is just down the hall. So I suggest you start thinking fast, or you can say goodbye to that deal. All right, you know, hold up. That Daniels guy got pretty heated with somebody on the phone. They were talking about a deal or a contract or something. He was talking with somebody named Patricia. What'd he say? He said he'd sign the papers over his dead body. Hang tight. - You watching through the two-way? - Yeah. Who's this Patricia he keeps talking about? That would be Morgan's wife. Daniels has got to be worth a few million bucks? Yeah, try a few hundred million, Pop. He's threatening to cut her off. Yeah, a pretty good motive to want to see him dead. Wait, does she have a computer background? No, I guess he was a lawyer-turned-socialite. Whoever caused the elevator to crash had to know their way around writing computer code. I don't know, maybe she teamed up with someone. Jesse, maybe? What about the VP. what's his name? Paul Redford? No. I looked into him. There's no priors. His record's clean. Besides, with Morgan dead, XCAL would have lost out on a huge contract, so, he had every reason to want Morgan to stay alive. I'm gonna have Amrita look into a possible Patricia-Jesse connection. Yeah, I'm going to go to Westchester, talk to her myself. Very good. I... Morgan wasn't much for cleanliness, was he? His mind was always working towards the next big idea. Guess he didn't have a lot of time for the little things. The only thing that he seemed to make time for was his standing Wednesday appointment. And what was so important that he couldn't miss it? I have no clue. Well, he certainly spent a lot of time at New York General. Could he have been sick? If he was, I didn't know about it. The only person he seemed to confide in was Jesse. Yeah, and she certainly seemed comfortable enough to give him an honest opinion. When Morgan announced that XCAL would be putting in a bid a few days ago, it took the office by surprise. Everyone was excited. Everyone except Jesse. She was against it from the beginning. She thought Morgan was putting money before his morals. I'm very sorry for your loss, Mrs. Daniels. Morgan was a brilliant man, Detective. But he did not make the best husband. Still, I heard he was pretty upset that you filed for divorce. Refusing to sign the papers. He didn't like that I started seeing someone. Paperwork wasn't even signed yet. Can't blame the guy. I never wanted to hurt Morgan. With the relationship starting so close to our marriage ending, I knew how much pain it would cause him. Despite taking every precaution, he found out about us anyway. So I take it he was going to turn this divorce into a knock-down, drag-out battle? We didn't have a prenup. I wanted what I was owed. So the guy you're seeing, it must have been pretty hard on him to watch you go through the anguish of a drawn-out separation. So you think that he killed Morgan? I don't know. I'm looking forward to the look on his face when I ask. Who he is isn't relevant, Detective. Okay, well, let's look at it this way, if Morgan could find out who you were seeing, imagine how long it's going to take someone with the resources of the entire New York City Police Department at his disposal. Keith Eisner. Your husband's main competitor? It wasn't my choice to fall for Keith. But I did. In spite of how it might look to some people. Okay, when was the last time you actually visited Morgan at his office? A year ago, maybe more. Can you remember offhand if Eisner ever went over to XCAL? You'd have to ask him. I plan to. Thank you for your time. Yes, hi. I've been on hold for Keith Eisner for, like, ten minutes now. I was wondering if... Hello? Hello? Good. Thank you. Nice chat. Tess. Logan. What're you doing here? I don't know. My job. What's your excuse? She was helping a woman in distress. - Thanks, Tess. - Of course. Remember, you just have to ease your foot off the clutch. Okay. - Bye. - Bye. So you're giving driving lessons now? - I thought you had a puzzle to finish. - I did. She was just having trouble getting Morgan's car going. Sounds a lot like this investigation. - Is it not going well? - One step forward, two steps back. - Well, this might help. - Okay? Apparently, Morgan was stopping by New York General Hospital every Wednesday at the same time. - Was he undergoing treatment? - I don't know. But if you give me a ride back to the city, we could stop by and find out. I don't know, Tess. I might have to get you a cab. Logan! Kidding. Come on, let's go. But I gotta make a pit stop. I'm starving. Good. Me too. Might have to make another pit stop, too. I need some gas. You got any extra cash? Can't help you there. Sorry about that. - Patricia and Eisner are dating? - Said so herself. Do you think they could've plotted to have Morgan killed? Well, this is what I'm thinking. I mean, go with me here. You've got two companies, all right? Each one of them are jostling for this big government contract, and Eisner says to himself, "You know what, I don't think I'm getting the upper hand here by planting all these bugs." "So I'm going to go kill Morgan, and then I'll make an offer to buy the company wholesale." - It's a good theory. - Thank you. I try. The thing is... Paul already pulled the XCAL bid. Help yourself. What? You were finished. Well, I am now, because you just took my last fry. So why did Paul pull his bid? Because all the work that Morgan put into the bid is on this hard-drive. The exact same hard-drive he took on the elevator. And it's destroyed? Well, I've got Amrita, actually, on the lookout for it, but yeah, I'm afraid it's toast. All right, talk to me. Was that not the best patty melt you've ever had in your life? I mean it's... it's the most patty melt I've ever eaten. No, it was... It was really amazing. Yeah. Yeah, my dad and I, when we're out this way, we always pop in here, so. - How is Chauncey? - How is Chauncey... Well, I think my dad is weighing retirement. - Good for him. - Really? - Yeah. - I don't know. I mean, if he needs a hobby, he and my aunt could find something to do together. Okay. How about lunch? Well, I don't... I don't think eating is a hobby. I mean, why doesn't your aunt Candace ask Chauncey out to lunch? Why? Because I want to see how serious he is about putting his papers in. - Logan. - What? - Why not ask him yourself? - Because... my dad would never in a million years tell me what he's really feeling. Us O'Connor men play things close to the vest. Besides, I think he would open up a lot easier to Candace. Fine. I will find out if she wants to be your go-between. Thank you. This was really great. Thank you for showing me this place. - Yeah, it's a cool place. - Yeah. And thank you for still being able to drive stick shift. It's a... it's a dying art form. And you know what, it had actually been a while. - Really? - Let me think, the last time... the last time was when I was supposed to go to France. Yeah. I had this theory. Romantic notion of driving an old VW Bug through the countryside. "Supposed to go"? What do you mean? It was going to be a holiday with my fiancé, but I called it off, so, no more fiancé, no more trip to France. I never knew that you were engaged. You know, I just couldn't shake the feeling that... marrying him was gonna be a big mistake. And... he wasn't the person I... wanted to spend my life with. Yeah. I mean, you know... Excuse me. Hey, Amrita. What's up? Really? Nothing? Okay. Thanks. There is no apparent link between Jesse and Patricia. Yeah, and Morgan's assistant said that Patricia hadn't been in his office in over a year. So Patricia probably didn't kill Morgan? No, it doesn't look that way, no. And they didn't have a prenup, so she was going to get - what she was owed anyway, so. - You're right. One step forward, two steps back. Excuse me. Hi, Detective O'Connor, NYPD. I was wondering if you... remember ever seeing this man? Came on Wednesdays, around 2:00 p.m., for the last couple of weeks. Yeah. He came to visit a friend. Good. You wouldn't happen to be able to tell us the name of the patient he was seeing, would you? You know I can't, Detective. Yeah, well... Yeah, you can't blame a guy for trying, though, right? Thanks for your help. Okay, so it must be someone who was really close to Morgan if he came every week. Maybe a family member? Or did he have any kids? No, he had no kids. Hey, Amrita. What's up? Are they sure? Great. Okay, yeah. Thanks. What is it? No sign of Morgan Daniels' hard-drive in the elevator wreckage. Okay, so maybe he... maybe he left it in the office? No, because his assistant said that she saw him put it in his pocket when he left his office. Right. Someone stole themselves a hard-drive that could be worth a fortune. So, it had to be taken between the office and the elevator. Okay, Tess, you were one of the last people to see this guy alive, okay? Do you remember seeing anybody that could've gotten close enough to do that? No. I mean, a... a woman did bump into him while he was looking down at his phone. She could've pickpocketed it off him. Would you recognize her? - I think so. - Really? Okay. Good. You said this woman had a pink streak - running through her hair, right? - Yeah, but I'm not seeing her. Let's check with Viv. See if... Viv. Viv. Do you know the name of a woman who works here, pink streak in her hair? Layla Barnes. Why? Is she here today? She was just a temp hire, just filling in for a few days. Were temps on that list of all your XCAL employees you sent over? No. Excuse me. Hey, Amrita, it's me. Hey, listen, do me a favor. Run a name for me through the DCJS, okay? - Yeah. Hit me. - Layla Barnes. Layla Barnes... She's got a sheet. Larceny, breaking-and-entering, pickpocketing... You got an address? Yeah. Sending it now. Listen, do you guys require background checks on all your potential employees? Most of the time. But... What? Layla came with a solid recommendation. - From who? - Jesse. - Thank you for your time. - Thanks. Well, I think... Jesse's working with Layla. She gets Layla to steal the hard-drive off Morgan, right, uses the elevator crash to cover it up. And then she gets away with a program that's worth a fortune. Right? I mean, Jesse, we know is in the wind, but maybe Layla's not that smart. What do you think? The way that Logan can rush head-first into a dangerous situation, yet, go to such lengths to avoid conflict with his father... is something he should maybe consider working on. He thinks he's more likely to open up to you - about how he's really feeling. - Maybe. Chauncey and I are overdue for a get-together. Well, on behalf of Logan, thank you. What about you? Do you ever... - do you ever think about retirement? - Me? No. It's outside of work that's in need of a reinvigoration. Well, since you've given up on your opera, is there something else that you want to do that you haven't done before? Skydiving. Skydiving? What? - Tess, I'm pulling your leg. - Okay, good. But there is this little Italian cooking class I've been thinking about down the street. That sounds like fun, and delicious. If you need a recipe taster, I'm your girl. You're on. Sorry, just one sec. - Hey. - Hey. Guess who I managed to find? Gregory Sackett. Morgan's old business partner. Yeah, he's in town for some kind of medical treatment. And while he's been denying press requests, a certain reporter was able to convince him to give an exclusive. How did you manage that? Just charm, reputation, an innate talent to make my subjects feel at ease. And it turns out that my father did some business with Sackett's brother. He vouched for me. I'm gonna go see him tomorrow, so meet me back at the office, and we can go together? Yeah, that sounds good. - All good? - Great. Layla Barnes... There you go. - Logan! - Yeah? - You all right? - Pop, I'm fine. Trust me, I'm okay. I just got a splitting headache and a welt the size of a golf ball. All right, talk to me. What do we got? Layla Barnes died from a single gunshot wound to the chest. We're checking with building management about security cameras. And we're canvassing to see if anyone spotted the shooter fleeing the scene. But so far, nothing. Any sign of Morgan's hard-drive? We've got Layla's laptop and a cache of burner cell phones. But, no hard-drive. All right. Good job. Thanks. You sure you're okay? I'm fine, Pop. And you think Morgan was visiting Sackett in the hospital? Well, I mean, it makes sense, right? You said that Sackett was in town for medical treatments. Well, if that's true, that must mean that they patched things up after all these years. Maybe Morgan divulged something to his old partner that he never told anyone else. I just can't believe he's gone. But I am grateful that he... reached out after our 20-year cold war. Do you know why Morgan did that, after all these years? Morgan was experimenting with XCAL's AI program. Integrating a data collection. Perhaps he was feeling nostalgic. Plugged my name in as a test. Wanted to see how much data it would collect. It knew... that I was suffering from kidney failure... how many doctors I was seeing. That's incredible technology. Kind of terrifying that a computer could... learn such personal details about you, isn't it? In the wrong hands, absolutely. Morgan had taken the seeds of our ideas and... created something more powerful than I could have ever imagined. Besides, it brought us back together one more time. I'll always be grateful of that. And was this data-collection program part of the government contract he was about to bid on? Yeah, he didn't talk too much about that. He... he was worried it would bring him bad luck. A man of science. Believing in the phenomenon of luck? Gwen always said... things that make humanity most interesting... contradictions. Gwen? The third member of our little Round Table. Guinevere Rice. She and Morgan were together when we created XCAL's first operating system. Which is named after Excalibur. The sword in the legend of King Arthur. Guinevere was King Arthur's wife. The company's name was a nod to her. Do you know where Ms. Rice is now? After I left the company, I heard they split up. That's a great idea, Candace. I look forward to it. Bye-bye. So where're we at? Well, we pulled some of the numbers from those burner phones we found in Layla Barnes's apartment. Every number corresponded to a different big tech company. Makes sense. Layla stole the hard-drive, she was reaching out to find a buyer. Most of the calls lasted less than a minute, probably thought she was some crank caller. But there was one that took that call a little more seriously. Almost lasted eight minutes. Eisner Industries. Bingo. There's so much smoke around Eisner, I'm starting to choke. You... you think he might've bought it? Or he thought the price was too high and decided to kill her for it instead. I'm heading over to Eisner Industries now. - Keep me posted. - Will do. Where's Eisner's office? Do you have an appointment? Don't need one. What's going on? Someone hacked in and hijacked our entire network. Shut the whole network down. Someone's trying to destroy my company, Detective. Do you think we could do this at another time? No, actually, I think this is the perfect time. Especially if you feel compelled to... confess to something. If you're asking me if I killed Morgan Daniels, the answer is no. And the bugs found in XCAL's office turned out to be an overzealous employee trying to win favor with me. What about Patricia? Patricia is a special woman. One Morgan should've appreciated more when they were still together. - Now, if that's all, Detective... - No, it's not all, Mr. Eisner. You see, a lady by the name of Layla Barnes called you at 10:43 yesterday. - I don't know anyone by that name. - Really? Well, Layla Barnes was an employee at XCAL. She stole a hard-drive off Morgan Daniels right before his death. Her phone records confirm that she called your cell directly. Now, does that ring any bells? I did receive a call yesterday morning from an unknown number. The person never identified themselves. Even used a voice scrambler. I couldn't tell you if they were male or female. But you certainly spoke for a while. I think it was almost eight minutes. Well, I wanted to hear them out. I think you were considering making a deal. No, Detective. I wanted to hear them out so I could give the police as many details about them as I could. The police? Purchasing stolen work product is illegal. I reported the approach to the Robbery Division of the NYPD. You do realize I'm going to check up on that, right? Then you'll see I'm telling the truth. Detective, Morgan and I were rivals, but we pushed each other to think bigger. His death is not only a loss for all he had left to give to the world, but for what those ideas would've inspired in me. Now, if you'll excuse me, Detective... I'd like to try to save my company now. Right. Okay. Thanks for your time. Before I moved over to homicide, I worked in the robbery division. We get called out to a bank robbery, and I'm interviewing a teller who handed the money over. I ask if she can remember any details about the suspect. She proceeds to tell me the guy's name, address, phone number. Wait, how could she know all that? The same guy who robbed the bank came in 20 minutes earlier to update all his account information! No! Come on! He ended up robbing the same teller he gave all his account info to. Wore a ski mask, but didn't even think to change his clothes. I mean, come on. Easiest collar I ever made. If only everything in life were that simple? You know, there's a rumor going around that you're thinking about retiring. - Yeah? - Logan told Tess. I've been giving... some thought to the idea, yes. Logan's having a difficult time thinking about you doing anything else. Well, to be honest, so am I. But that's also kind of the exciting part, isn't it? Have you given any thought as to what you might do when it's time to hang things up? I had this romantic notion of traveling up and down Italy, taking cooking lessons along the way. Sounds great. In fact, I got a jump-start on it today. I signed up for an Italian cooking class. You did? Wow. I could save a fortune if I learned how to make a decent plate of pasta at home. Yeah! Do you think there might be... an open spot in the class? I'll check. Great. Change is never easy, Chauncey. Especially at our age. But with age comes wisdom. Whatever you decide, I know it will be the right decision. Yeah. Thank you very much for your time, ma'am. Thank you. Bye. No luck finding Gwen? Big old goose egg so far. Well, Gwen and Morgan and Gregory all went to MIT, right? Yeah. Their alumni office might be able to give you her current contact information. Tess, you're a genius. Well... I don't know about that. Don't thank me before this goose egg hatches. - MIT Alumni. - Hi. Hi, yes. I was trying to get some contact information for an alumna of yours, Guinevere Rice. We don't disclose that information. You don't give out that kind of information, of course, but, I... I'm calling because... I... I recently purchased a house that Gwen once owned and I found some boxes that she left behind in the attic and I would just really love to give them back to her if you could give me any information that would... Gwen was in a car accident and passed away. I... I'm so sorry to hear that. But I can pass on her daughter's number. Her daughter's number? Yes, that would be... That would be great. What's that? All right, thank you for the help. Gwen died in a car accident in 1993. That must have been right after her and Morgan broke up. They gave me her daughter's number, though. Maybe she has some information on the relationship between Gwen and Morgan. Yeah. It's worth giving her a call. Right. You've reached Jesse Alexander. You know what to do. What is it? I think Jesse Alexander is Gwen's daughter. Hey. Hey, Pop. What's up? have you heard back from Robbery yet? Eisner filed a report right after his call with Layla. So he was telling the truth. Maybe this'll turn your frown upside down. Layla Barnes and Jesse Alexander were in the same work-release program together. What? Jesse did time? "Jesse" didn't, but Stephanie Rice did ten months for hacking into the DOJ, NSA, and DOD. So she changed her name. That's why it took so long to pull her file. Didn't want her record muddying the waters for jobs in the tech sector. Right. Do you think she might've killed Morgan to halt the bid? Come on, Pop. I mean, she clearly wasn't a fan of government institutions, right? And was very upset that Morgan was pursuing a deal. She's been in the... the wind ever since the crash. I mean, come on, I think we have a good case here to get a warrant to search her place? I'll get Amrita to get a judge's john hancock on it right away. - Great. - Son. Yeah? I wanted to let you know... I've given a lot of thought to retirement... and I think it's time. Listen, Pop, if this is something you wanna do, I'm behind you 100 percent, all right? Hey, once we wrap this case up, let me take you out to celebrate. - I would like that. - Okay. I don't know why you're following me, but maybe you'd like to explain it to the police. Please, don't. Jesse? I gotta tell you, hacking into the Department of Defense is no small feat. If she could get past their security... Safe to assume she can get into XCAL's security system and change the safety protocols. - Logan? - Yeah? Is that Morgan's missing hard-drive? Fantastic. One second. Detective O'Connor. Yeah. Really? When did you find this out? Well, okay then. Thank you. That was Computer Crimes. They just went through the whole XCAL security system. Morgan wasn't the only one who had access to the AI system. Turns out that he authorized Jesse Alexander a week ago. - Really? - Yeah. A lot of people are looking for you. I know. Your detective friend came to my apartment the other day. I called Viv to find out what he wanted to talk to me about. She said that you two know each other. You have to tell him that I didn't kill Morgan. Why not tell him that yourself? Because I'm trying to find out who did, and some of the ways that I'm doing that aren't exactly legal. You cared a lot about Morgan, didn't you? I found out your mom and Morgan dated. XCAL's name is a reference to her. Morgan was my father. What? I... I'm so sorry... No one else knew that, did they? No... No, but... I found out when I was a teenager. He's why I got into computers. But he had no idea you were his daughter? No, he hired me at XCAL without any idea that Gwen was my mother. But... a few weeks ago, he pulled me aside, asked me if my real name was Stephanie Rice. Because he put "Jesse Alexander" into the data-collection program. Scrubbing my identity wasn't easy, but Morgan's program, just as it did with Patricia and Gregory Sackett, connected the dots, which is... which is exactly why I think it is too dangerous to sell to the government. I regretted the fact that I hadn't told him myself. He was kind... and supportive. I was just... I was just starting to get to know him. - Detective O'Connor? - Yo? Jesse Alexander's been spotted in a park, talking to an unidentified woman. All right, tell the patrolman not to let them out of his sight. I'm on my way. Do you really think Eisner killed Morgan? Well, he's the only one that makes sense. You have to go to the police. You have to tell them everything you know. I can't do that, Tess. Because she doesn't want to get arrested for the murder of Layla Barnes. Wait... What are you talking about? Jesse, please stand up. You know, you and I are going to have a long conversation about what it means to interfere in an ongoing investigation. Jesse Alexander, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. An attorney will be appointed to you if you cannot afford one... So were you the one that recommended Layla Barnes for a job at XCAL? Yes. Did you also conspire with her to steal Morgan's hard-drive out of his office before he died? What? No. I didn't even know that Layla took it. I just assumed that it was destroyed in the crash. But it's funny, we found it in your apartment, Jesse. All in one piece. Okay... no, no, no, no. Someone is trying to frame me. I have no idea how it got there. Didn't Morgan also have plans to sell XCAL's data-collection technology to the government? Which you didn't like the whole idea even from the start. I mean, I heard you even, you know, let everybody know about it in the office, right? I made my case, okay? But it was always gonna be Morgan's decision. Morgan was my father... And nobody knew about that, did they? You know, Jesse, it must have upset you, hurt you, for that matter that your own father wasn't willing to tell the world that you were his daughter. We were trying to figure it out the best way that we could. I was just beginning to build... a relationship with him, why would I want to kill him? Because, Jesse, if Morgan sold that technology to the government, then he would be betraying everything you ever stood for, now, wouldn't he? No, no. Look, it had to be Eisner. He hated my father. Is that why you hacked into his network, and wrote that whole "Confess" message for him? I've got to be honest, a smart move. It makes you deflect suspicion from yourself. I'd like to call a lawyer. Okay. Okay. Tess. Tess. I'm not sure this is the best place for you to be. I... I just want to explain to Logan what happened. Jesse is a suspect in at least one homicide. As soon as you made contact with her, you should've let us know. If anything... anything were to happen to you, Logan would never forgive himself. And I can't blame him. If whoever it was that knocked Logan out decided to pull the trigger instead, I... Wait, what happened to Logan? Is he okay? Layla Barnes' murderer took him by surprise. He could've been killed. I had no idea. Tess. What're you doing here? Logan, I just... I came here to apologize. You were possibly sitting across from a killer, who could've done who knows what if she was cornered. - You understand? - I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry. How'd it go with Jesse? She lawyered up. I... I just don't think Jesse's the kind of person who could do all this. Well, you'd be surprised what people are capable of doing with the right circumstances. Jesse's too smart to keep a stolen hard-drive at her apartment. That stolen hard-drive, Tess, is worth a fortune. She probably didn't want it out of her sight. Amrita. Have you figured out Layla's password yet? No. We gotta get in there. If we can get in, we can maybe find some communication between Layla and Jesse, proving that they were working together to steal Morgan's hard-drive, right? Computer Crimes was able to determine it's a seven-digit password. I know this sounds silly, but have you tried one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. It's consistently one of the most common passwords people use. Okay. Hey, it's worth a try. Let's go. - No. - What about words? I mean, how many seven-letter words are there? There's over 33,000 in the English language. Words are kinda my thing. Yeah. You know, I keep a list of the passwords I use on a little notepad near my desk. Did we find anything like that in her apartment? Yeah. A list of everything we've collected and bagged out of her apartment. It's all over there. Okay, what have we got here? We've got... A five by three spiral notebook. - Amrita. Amrita, do me a favor. - Yeah. Try one of those seven digits. Try the next one. - We're in. - We're in. Well, it's good to know people under 50 have trouble remembering their passwords, too. Come on, Pop. You're gonna miss this feeling of cracking a case wide open, you know it. I'm not gonna take the bait. I should probably take off. Sure, yeah, right. Bye. Tess! Hey, Tess. Hey, I was just on my way to take Morgan's hard-drive back to XCAL. I don't know if I could give you a lift home? Yeah, that'd be... That'd be great, thanks. Isn't the hard-drive considered... - considered evidence? - Normally, it is, yeah, but your friend, Viv, made a call in to the Mayor's office to nudge the DA for a speedy release, so. They're probably itching to put the bid back in for the government contract. Yeah. It's nice to have friends in high places. I wouldn't know. I only hang out with riff-raff like you, so. - Hey. - What? It's... it's my editor. Go ahead and take it. I'm just gonna be a minute. Hi. Yes, I was actually just about to hit send on tomorrow's puzzle. Hey, Paul. Is... is Viv around? I told her to head out. There's no reason for the both of us to stay late. Guess you're right. Well, this is yours. Thank you for bringing it home. - No problem. - So... Jesse's really responsible for Morgan and Layla's deaths? It's certainly looking like she is, yeah. Excuse me. Hey, what's up? You'll never guess what I found on Layla's computer. Copies of Eric Ogden's audio files. She must've been the one that went in and erased them before we got there, right? Lucky for us, not before making copies. She probably needed an insurance policy, in case someone thought she was a loose end. Yeah, well, I started listening to some of them, and one was a conversation between Morgan and Paul the night before he died. - About what? - The data-collection program. Anything interesting? Yeah. Morgan actually agreed with Jesse. He told Paul that he was gonna inform the Board of Directors that he was pulling out of the bid. Erasing a huge payday for everyone. And after Morgan left, Paul made a call. - To who? - No, not sure. I could only hear Paul's side of the conversation. But whoever it was, he asked to meet them later that night. Do me a favor. Keep going through those files for me, okay? All right, bye. Hey, Paul. You... you made a call the night before Morgan's murder. You don't recall to who, do you? I think I arranged to meet a colleague for a drink, but I'll check my phone. Must be pretty nice to have that hard-drive back? Now you can follow through with that bid. It was lucky someone stole it before the crash. You know, this... thing would have been a lot simpler if Layla just took the money I offered her. Instead, she thought she could sell the hard-drive to the highest bidder. So you killed her, didn't you? Spared your life, though. And that's not a mistake I'm not going to make twice, Detective. Stay out of it, Tess. Just... Yeah. Take your gun out. Slowly. Place it on the ground. Kick it over to me. You're going to walk backwards, slowly, around the corner, towards the stairs. You know, Paul, my boss knows I came here, so. You'll have the whole force after you. You know that, right? By the time they come looking, I'll be touching down in a country without an extradition treaty. While it's not the billions it should've been, the few hundred million I'm gonna make from selling the technology on the black market will make for... pretty decent living. That's it. Keep going. Nice and easy. All the way to the stairs. You don't have to do this. You could even set off the alarm systems if you wanted to. BB, activate the alarm! Hey, BB, shut off the alarm. Nice try. Logan. Give me the gun, Tess. Give me the gun. Now, Tess! - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. So the hard-drive was empty? Yeah, Morgan must've deleted the program before he died. All this death for nothing. So how did Paul change the safety protocols if he didn't have access? Well, he watched Morgan sign in one day and memorized the password. - Human error. - Yeah. Well, I'm glad you two are all right. It was Tess here who came to my rescue. - Thank you. - You're welcome. And I couldn't be more grateful for it. Thank you. Of course. Didn't you say the reservation was at 7:00? Yeah, no, it is, Dad. I just... I forgot my wallet on my desk. No, no, no, no. You didn't forget your wallet. I know what you're up to. - Really? - When you told me it was your treat, I started putting two and two together. Okay? You are throwing a surprise retirement party for your old man. Pop, I'm not throwing you any party, okay? But I agree, you do deserve to be celebrated. Though that may be true, I've had some second thoughts, and I'm... well, turns out you were right. What's that? I'm sorry. I didn't hear you correctly. Can you repeat that? You were right. That feeling of the chase. The whole thrill, rush of putting together a case, I'm not quite ready to give that up yet. Well, Pop, I always knew you weren't ready. What, you knew? I can see it in your eyes. Which is why I'm not throwing you a retirement party. Okay? Come on. I'll get my wallet. Surprise! An "Unretirement" party. Fantastic! To all that lies ahead. To spaghetti pomodoro, linguini and clams, and penne arrabbiata! Hi, Everyone, if I can just have your attention for a moment. A toast to the man of the hour... - No... - You're not going to do this. To your distinguished... and ongoing career. You make the department, the city, and your family very proud every single day. We love you, Pop. To Chauncey! To Chauncey! This is lovely. And... you're very sweet. Well. I mean, when you want to be. Don't... don't let it get out. Okay. Listen, Tess... I know I'm not the most... open person with my emotions. I think it's this job that teaches you to compartmentalize... which can put a lot of strain on relationships. I have... already lost one marriage because of it. - I had no idea. - Yeah. You know, after my brother was killed... my ex was adamant that I should quit. She said, "You know what, I can't cope with seeing you put yourself in harm's way each and every day." And I told her, I said, "Look, all I've ever wanted to do with my life was be a detective. And so... I chose my job over my marriage. I wanted to tell you this when you were telling me about your fiancé. I mean, I did, but I was, like... "The O'Connor men keep things close to the vest." Yeah. Too close, I'm realizing. But I'm also seeing... the upside of letting people in... instead of keeping people at arm's length. And that... is because of you. So, thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers.
