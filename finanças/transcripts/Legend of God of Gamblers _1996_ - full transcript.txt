I came here earlier than you did You are drunk Really? I can't help drinking Since you followed Uncle, my happy days ended I practice hardly everyday And you play with Hing everyday You are lucky, you are gifted Why can't I have a chance to compete with you? Why should I back you up every time? Why can't I have a chance to have fair competition with you? Why should I always be the second one? Come on!

I will win Bastard, you just addict to drinking Hing, would you please go out for a while God-father, what's this? Gun! Each can shoot one bullet It's prohibited to take the gun to the casino tomorrow But I worry that the Indonesians would pull off a stunt So, you and I will carry one each Precaution is better than cure I don't think it's necessary Just put it in your pocket I booked tickets to Italy After the victory, we'll celebrate in Italy Bravo! Thank you for giving us chance to watch a brilliant show! If that three guys didn't boost too much, it would have been a tough job for us to get these VIP tickets Don't forget his consecutive kicks He knocked them out and thus we get the tickets By the way, if they come for revenge, what do we do? I haven't thought of this question When I kick after eating, the guy would wake up 4-5 hours later Ko Chun is great... You will win much by betting on Ko Chun Who is she? My friend That Seven you've mentioned? Chun, just try your best to fix Soto I want you to win as much as you can Remember what I have taught you? "Before winning his money," "threaten your enemy first" The 2nd stance is "A lion can easily get a rabbit" "gesture wins" Scare him! God-father, the last stance of playing showhand is.. "Powerful enemy, retreat;" "And devote him the chance" Why? It means, if your enemy has better chance just pretend to be dummy, retreat Make the opponent think you would lose, then he'll relax How about devote the chance? It's used when a swindler faces another powerful swindler I'll teach you later I won't go this time, play among yourselves One million I'll follow Another five million Don't you think you have more queens? I'll follow You miss the eight 3 million I'll follow, and show hand Good I'll follow Three sevens Very good You're the best female gambler I know. What a pity that... Three eights She doesn't match Ko, don't you think so? No, they are prefect match! You have bad taste! I am sorry! So No preview, I'd say five million I have a king and an ace, it worths ten million Uncle wants me to follow Thirty million more I follow So, how is it? You follow that too! I've got a pair to you it's not fair. Fifty million! He is so cocky Uncle is so confident! I'll follow It seems to be straight flush Straight flush? You don't bet much, I don't think so! If I got these cards, I'd have been rich I despise you. Your bid! (lip-reading) Show hand, you'll win, don't panic You show-hand devil! No one would be afraid of you! I'll follow Only we can be qualified to play I'll bet all on the table Are you so confident? I have a stronger position, like a lion against a rabbit So? Fine! This is a bank cheque from Swiss Bank US ten million Side bet Show-hand, bet all on the table Check it Any more raise? Mr. Ko Ngo, you dropped your cheque this morning $25 million US dollars I'll follow You two are show-hand devils I won't fool with you Soto... You'll lose like a small potato! Go home now! To be slave of your wife! Cover the cards Ko Ngo I don't want to talk to you Chun, I've something to say to you God-father, Ngo can't win, why did he follow? He's got straight flush Impossible God-father, I don't think he has straight flush Trust me He'll raise the bet and show-hand later Don't follow Why not? It's meaningless to get a name Who is the God of Gamblers, you know it, that's enough You forget what I have told you? A best gambler should be in low profile Winning money is all our goal God-father, did you make the underground bet? I am the biggest banker I accept US$3 billion which is bet on you If you win, I will lose one billion Don't you think of my feeling? Let Ko Ngo be the God of Gamblers for few months Few months later, I'll disclose his trick then you'll become the God of Gamblers again Sorry Chun, I am old Don't you want me to go bankrupt? God-father, I promise I will make more money for you for compensation But tonight, I want to win the fame from a fair game This is the world of young men Chun, I understand you very much Just go ahead, I'll make your dream come true God-father I wish Hing to marry a good husband Thank you No problem... Chun, I saw the one who killed your dad He always smiles, but his smiles terrified you You should get this guy Since Ko Chun was shot, the committee decided to let Miss Kent Hing, his fiancee, open this card for him Chun, are you alright? Mr. Ko gets a pair of ten and a pair of nine You can't die Mr. Ko Ngo gets a straight flush Wake up Mr. Ko Ngo is the winner, he is... the God of Gamblers! In the name of father and of the son and of the holy spirits, amen Our father in heaven, holy be your name, your Kingdom come Your word be done on earth as if in heaven Give us today our daily bread... Please bless Ko Chun Bring him good health Hope he would be escaped from hell Are you his relatives? Yes, I think I am The patient is the most lucky guy The bullet entered from his skull on the right, left from the left side, it didn't stay in his brain Most of the nerves are not broken But he will be vegetable within a short period He can't talk clearly, he can't express his own feeling He will get angry, and has inclination to commit suicide He needs more care from his family Any special news? Ko Ngo receives everything from Ko Chun Including his girl So, it's a golden chance for Miss Seven You can never let him read this paper Destroy it Miss Seven What's the matter? This way You haven't slept for days, take a rest first It's alright, I am fine I want him to see my face when he opens his eyes again This is easy Like this Don't wake him up It's just for fun Who is going to play with you? No! I'll get the doctor Stop it! I beg you I know you want to die You nearly became the God of Gamblers But you failed, I share your hard feeling too If I were you, I would have gotten rid of the tubes But I beg you For whatever reason, please live Doctor said you could recover You can get back what you owned before You understand it? Hing... I am Seven Kent Hing... Do you want to see her? I will get her here Hurry up! That is my horse racing paper, I've looked for ages They married yesterday Why don't you cry? At least you can say something The silence scares me! The patient would lose all senses of taste You can try any of his taste bud which is still functioning So he has to eat a lot Don't throw it Try the ginger and vinegar, it's tasty How is it? Nice? Drink more Doctor, if we stimulate his emotion carelessly, what would be the result? See how serious is the stimulation, he may get mad Maybe, he will be mentally retarded, like a small kid Ko Chun, you haven't eaten for days, please give me face, let me feed you It's cooked for a long time, eat something We've tried many food, better buy some chocolates this time We can eat it if he rejects it Chocolate How many days he hasn't taken any food? About three days Ko Chun, you have to eat You must save your life to take revenge Save your life to take revenge Open your mouth Don't move He doesn't want to eat, don't push him Don't move Eat more You don't eat, so how can you take revenge? Eat! He is willing to eat now He feels tasty! Take more to him He likes eating chocolate Eat more He tastes only chocolate with bitter taste Yeah, Miss Seven What? We are informed that, Ko Chun isn't dead Sure! He is still alive It's known by public, that means Ko Ngo knows it too He will terminate Ko Chun So... The patient can go home for rehabilitation But remember, his brain is hurt, don't try to drive him crazy I know, we will be careful But you'd pay $300,000 before leaving the hospital What? You are driving me crazy! Finally I've gathered $300,000, then I took Ko Chun home, I'm so happy in these days, cause I can serve his bathing everyday I rented some video tapes for you to kill time In fact, I love watching Cantonese movies But I think you love watching Hollywood films I've watched this many many times Alan Delon is so smart His image is always copied by local TV productions He gels his hair So smart looking You haven't talked for a long time You've come back for over two months, my mom said, don't let those unhappy things stay in your heart, voice out It'll comfort you better By the way, if I were you who stayed in bed a month, I did want to kill myself too Can't move and can't talk If poorer than staying in jail If I have to lie in bed forever, I wish someone'd cut my tubes But you are lucky, you will recover soon God is helping you too, you should value yourself, right? If you gel your hair, would you be as smart as Alan Delon? It stinks What? The hair gel stinks Did you talk to me? You are willing to talk In these 2 months, I have made up my mind I met my Waterloo But, there are still many many games in one's life Once I have chance, I may not be loser forever Thank you If I were you, I can't go through this hard time You can get back what ever belongs to you If you gamble next time, have Alan's hair style, OK? No, it stinks It's as stink as the salted fish I do want to see you in Alan's hair style I promise, I will gel my hair once for you Why not... Now? Not now! Now, OK? Do you want to borrow money from your dad? Of course, or how can I help Ko Chun to fight back? I am afraid he has no money Why? He owes Mo Kau much money Last time we beated Kau, it brings much trouble to us It's alright Think carefully Seven, why do you come here? Run! Do you want to look for trouble? Your dad owes me money You beated me and made me sleep in hospital Now, I have to make you pay for it You want money, right? Ah So I'm going to get you money from the ETC, let's go Freeze!

Be careful, Mr. God of Gamblers Now you are facing another challenge If you can't do it well, it'll have big influence Last month, I fanticized people in Las Vagas, but... they'll organize an international God of Gamblers competition I don't know what their intention is It's politics Among the casinos, there are many conflicts of interest If they admit an Asian to be the God of Gamblers, God of Gamblers how can they have face? I will win too But, if Ko Chun just pretends to be insane? Do you have confidence to defeat him? Come out Hands off! What are you eavesdropping? I didn't, I just passed by You are lying Hands off! Your hand is as soft as a baby's You feel great pain even I squeeze lightly, right? I tell you, you are my wife! You should stand by my side If you do something wrong, you will know the result Do you want Ko Chun to join the race? I wanna sell my granny's flat to finance him Don't you think you are helping him instead of putting him to hell? Let's think something Only district representative can join the competition We can't help it, so what'll we do? Help! Don't go! Help! Ko Chun... Those foreigners get Ko Chun! You are useless! It must be done by Ko Ngo, let's call the police I am going to Macau tomorrow If they want to kill Ko Chun, they won't kidnap him "Int.

You cheated me too! No more cheatings, I won't cheat you anymore I see, we have been watched! So, how you contacted the Australian?

I try my best No way, I want to know everything Is this house safe? This is arranged by the Australian They want me to have better sleep Do you have confidence? Ko Ngo and that Tony from the Philippines are good gamblers What worry me most is... What stance Kent didn't teach me? I don't think there is any That's shit! I understand him so well If he doesn't think he can win he will kill me tonight Mr. Kent, can we move now? Wolf, not until 1:30 am It's the time people usually want to sleep most Take action at that time Kill everyone in three minutes Yes You fought with Lone Ng in Vietnam, you should know him well He escape in Vietnam, I don't think he'd be lucky anymore Precaution is better than cure Why isn't anyone here? I feel safe to sleep in your room tonight No matter what, we won't sleep in separate rooms tonight Dad Run! Don't kill me, I tell you everything Seven is now staying with Ko Chun in the sitting room This is a flat of two thousand sq feet, it's easy to find them The kitchen is on the second floor There is a roasted goose in the fridge If you want to eat it, just heat it by the microwave oven Lone Ng is now bathing He always wets the floor, beware of slippery floor Be careful I am a part time maid, none of my business I know nothing, let me go please Say something! Wolf, let him go now This isn't Vietnam Chun, don't come out Ko Chun, Lone Ng, come to save her if you can I will count three, if you don't show up I will push her down Help... One two...

You're like being locked up inside a box It's dark, and you can't move But this box... can never be opened I don't want you to be like this I said, I would gel my hair once for you Although you can't see it I promised, so I will do it I remember you said once, if we're lying on bed as I did last time you would have removed all tubes Now I swear to marry you!

I am sorry for what happened last night But I believe that... After the game, you will feel more miserable And I really want to tell you Your hair style is so ugly looking Chun, I have something to talk to you Let's talk later It's important Hing! Now the race starts Kau, tonight you sit behind Chun He has a bad habit, he likes watching the cards by folding one of its corner I didn't advise him about this habit, cause I'm afraid he'd pick on me one day Covered card is four Three hundred thousand Quit Quit Quit... He didn't take part for 20 consecutive games I think he is looking for sure win cards 2 million Now you move, will it be too late? Most of their money go to me, if I act cowardly as you to quit the following games, I will be the sure winner You are the God of Gamblers, how can you be a coward? Sometimes, it doesn't mind to lose face I quit You are right, I am the God of Gamblers Don't blame me of not giving you chance, one million I'll follow I'll follow Now it's my bid, five million Do you want to see my ace with such low price? Ten million more If you want to follow, add 15 million You said I was late, so I have to follow Sure Do the Australians give you much? You have a pair of twos, if you get three twos, just show-hand, you nuts! Alright, I'll follow, ten million I am so sorry, I've got three twos I can't help Show-hand Don't you think you can win by this? I'll follow I have much money! I'll follow God of Gamblers, it's your turn His covered card must be a heart ten Ko Chun has three twos on table, but the Philippino follows too, he must have three kings This is not wise to follow Ngo, when I take out my handkerchief tonight, that means, just forget anything but go ahead I have my own way to fix Ko Chun What stance will you use? You will know it later When I take out my handkerchief, you just go ahead, don't quit Alright, I will join your party! Is flush bigger than trebleton? I'll follow Shit! I am sorry, it's my turn to bid He has no more money, now we are the only competitors left No way, you should give others chance Why don't you ask your boss to raise the bet? Behind me, there is approximately 30 million US dollars, you have right to win by a show-hand I request... ...to suspend the race temporarily All are nuts! They are insane! Mr. Ko Chun, do you have any bet increment? They didn't prepare extra money for me I do Are you crazy? What are you doing? Chun, I wanted to talk to you about this matter Ko Ngo, I've suffered enough, I bring all my money along with me, I just want to wait for this chance, this is a bank cheque of 30 million US$, I wanna finance Ko Chun Hing Chun, forget about me, I wanna back you up with my money I won't tolerate that creep any more I have my own decision, better go back first Check the bank cheque Ko Chun, how dare you seduce my wife! Mind your tongue, anyways, we have to settle everything this day Great The cheque is valid Open the cover I want to get back what belonged to me Show hand! Not that easy You seduced my wife, I wanna bet on your hands Whoever loses should cut his hands off Do you have to go that far? You want a settlement, right? How can I give you chance to take revenge again? Board of justice, is this bet allowed? We won't bother, it's your private matters I won't join you, nuts! I prefer saving my hands for squeezing women's tits I guess you have a flush at least, even I have 3 kings, I quit Are you chicken? Alright, you pushed me! I'll follow Show me your card You can't have a heart ten Cause this is... Chun, I am sorry, I betrayed you I married him, I am his wife I have to help him, I am sorry I can't imagine that, last time I got a straight flush to win, this time, I get a straight flush too Ladies and gentlemen, straight flush! Why isn't it a heart ten? Why isn't it a heart ten? Kent, you asked Hing to change the covered cards of ours This is a wise stance, but what a pity that, when I saw Hing at the first sight, she looks totally different She fell for another man, that makes her do anything she can I let her change my card intentionally You who asked Kau to peep at my card behind me, I know it very well He just saw the corner of a card which I hid inside the ring My covered card isn't a heart ten It's a three club this stance is what you haven't taught me "Devote to your powerful enemies" I used this three club to devote to you You swindler! Judge, he is a swindler I did this cause I find deceiving activity beforehand Isn't it against the regulations? No So, what does that mean? He has three twos, and you get only an ace, he is the winner then Holy shit! Pay your debt now And your hands too Bring me an axe Uncle, save me! I can't lose my hands Don't you understand? If you are worthless to him, he will never save you Bastard, you cheated me! It is a real lip-stick, isn't it weird? You got two guns last time and you used one This time, I am sure you will bring another one So I asked someone to change it for you Precaution is better than cure! Now, your kingdom fell Now, I declarre that the International God of Gamblers is... Mr. Ko Chun Since that day, Ko Chun has seldom been seen by public, many people tell me about the legends of Ko Chun Someone said he has two students, Dagger and Sing Some people said, he appeared in Nepal with Seven, but, no one knows which saying is correct
