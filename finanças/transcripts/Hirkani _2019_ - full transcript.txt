Hoping to see the great king... she's had a sparkle in her eyes. But you... Let it go, Ma. What does he care? He's the king's man. and is Bahirji Naik's aide. If he wanted... he could've taken me to the king's fort. My dear wife! One day, our mighty king will send... a palanquin. He'll say - Bring Jeevaji Rao's wife to the fort. Let's gift her a saree and blouse. She's taken such good care of our soldier.

Why're you crying? Shush now! What happened? Why's my baby crying? Your baby... is too fragile! But what happened, Jeeva? Nothing, Mother. I thought: He's going to be the king's soldier... and bear sword wounds... and so... I pinched him to test him. Give him to me! Ma, you hold him. He's just a baby! How could you made him cry so?! Just like his mother... he's a dainty doll. Jeeva! Look! There it is! Hey, what's going on? Mhadba! Tukya, talk to me! Where do I start, Jeeva - We're being tormented by that beast. Beast? A wolf from the forest. It gobbled hens and goats earlier... and now attacks babies! It entered Ganga's house and attacked little Ithu. And when we chased it, it sped off. We are at our wits' end! Which way did this wolf go? That way. Wait! Where are you going?! Somebody, stop him! Stop! I couldn't find it! I'd have ripped it to pieces! Heera? Heera! Heera... Heera, m'lady... are you still cross? My lovely wife... What's up with you? What happened? You took an axe, ran into the forest. If something befell you... who'd have cared for us? Did you think of that? Does a tiger fall before a wolf? Don't be absurd! With the whole village there... why did you run off alone? It's like this - If our king in that fort... said what you just did... that one shouldn't face danger alone... this kingdom would not exist. I am that king's soldier... and it is my duty to protect citizens... from human foes and wolves. I am terrified of that beast. You know, when it tore off with Anshi's baby... I saw it. Just before entering the forest, it stopped and looked back. And I saw its blood-thirsty, evil eyes. Well, imagine... if, instead of another's child, it was our... Why would you say such a thing?! I won't let anything happen to my child! But, if so, you would have fought... that beast, yes? How would I fight? I'd be filled with fear. I'd say - Take me, not my baby. Rubbish! You're MY wife, and... When it's before you... don't be scared. The animal senses, right away... your fear. Look straight into its eyes. That's how you'll know when it will attack. And as it leaps, ram your weapon into its throat. Game over! Women dole out joy from their homes at dawn... Alms for the needy! I've got your alms. I'll get them. Gosh! What happened? What was I thinking! My hands are all dirty! On your hands, even cow-dung is divine. It's you! You duped me again! My disguises earn me the king's praises. But here... they are not valued! But... Do you have a pretty saree inside? Well, do you? Why? Someone getting married? Yes. I am. Go off, then! Fine, I'll go! The queen's called you to the fort. But what do you care... What?! The queen sent me an invite? Yes! The eldest queen has invited us - you, me and our son. Really? Really. She said - You haven't brought your child to me since his birth... Jeevaji Rao. Wow! She called you RAO? Jeevaji Rao. Clean up your face! Don't wail before the queen. Ok? Uphold my honour. Let's go. C'mon... I've probably done some good in my last birth. That's why I am now... a great king's soldier... your father... and your husband. This blast again! When my baby's playing... that cannon ruins it! There, there. There, there, Heera... Shall we leave? We're late. Let's go. This way. Heera. Heera! When we enter, don't stand and stare at the queen. Remember to touch her feet... - and place our child there. - place our child at her feet. Ok? Ok. Gosh! Now look what he's done! He's wet himself. Leave it. How can I leave it? We're going to meet the queen... with our baby in soiled pants?! - But, Heera... - Wait. Here?! Your father... What? ...says to leave it. How can I leave it? Tell him - Dad... the queen's invited me. Hurry now! I will look so handsome... that she'll shower me with love. Heera. Heera! Wait, almost done. Who was that? Who was it? Our great king. What! Have you lost it?! It was the king? But you didn't... You were changing his diaper. That other time you missed seeing our king... you were mad at me! Now get mad at your son! Jeevaji Rao, the queen is calling for you. Right. Let's go! Let's go. Look there. Heera, come in. Quickly! C'mon. God bless you. What's your name? Heera. Wow! Jeevaji Rao... she's a real diamond, just like her name. And is this our young soldier? Let me see. Give him to me. He's adorable. Today, I've seen your face for the first time. What shall I gift you? Let's ask your mother. Well? Who am I to demand anything... Our little soldier... is crying because of the cannon's sound? It's an everyday problem. Everyday! That pest... I mean... the moment the cannon fires, he starts wailing. Really? If you silence this cannon, I'll be grateful. What's that? You want me to stop the cannon firing? I mean... my child can't sleep because of it. Do you know why this cannon fires? The cannon fires to mark the end of day. My mother-in-law said - This is not a cannon. This is a mother calling out a slogan... which is... 'Having won our independence... we must cherish and protect it'. His generation, which will also protect our independence... should get used to this mother's call. What say, young soldier? Am I right? Bangles, come buy bangles! Move your feet faster! Ladies! Don't dawdle, move on. The old guy's yelling! I'm leaving! C'mon. Heera. I want to buy bangles. He's selling, look! But why now? The cannon will fire now. There's time. We'll rush there and back. Once it closes, the door opens tomorrow... I warn you! See? Ignore that old man. Come with me! Let's go. Deserting your posts, I see! The cannon fired! Run! Chandra, you crazy girl... your immense wisdom almost got us stuck here. How was I to know... the cannon would fire and... Heera! What now? Realise something? What? The cannon fired so close to your son... but he didn't react! True! The queen was right. My baby hears the cannon as a mother's call. Yes? No? C'mon! Let's go. Goddess, where is she?! It gets dark suddenly. In the dark, anything can happen! Aunty! Gosh! Ma! Where've you been? I thought you got stuck at the fort. No, Ma, we were... You get home quickly. It's not good for the baby to be out so late. I'm heading to the doctor. Why? To get some medicine for my aching knees. Ma, listen - Take your grandson home. I'll get your medicine from the doctor. But... No Buts! Why walk on aching legs to get medicine for aching legs... when her legs can walk there instead? Exactly! Chandra. Yes? You go home with Ma. Ok. I'll see you soon. Ma, take him. Let's go, Chandra. Be careful. We will. Who is it? Who... Who are you?! I am the seed of the Evil Spirit... close kin of the Dark One... bred from the Devil Himself. Who are you?! Speak up. The king has a soldier called Jeevaji Rao. I am his wife. I will eat your husband's raw flesh and spit it out... before you know it. Hey pig-face! At the fort is the great king... and at home is my husband. Really? But right here... there's just me. Look! Here's my tiger! What're you doing?! My wife is so unsuspecting. Why're you trying to fool her, Naik? Gosh! Naik? Please forgive me, Sir. Bless you. So, child... did you like my disguise? Why this unexpected visit, Naik? We must leave on a scout of Janjira fort. When? Tomorrow. At dawn. Yes, sir. Listen... don't leave now, please. We haven't had our child's naming ceremony yet. Stay for that. You didn't say 'No' to Naik. You can go to our great king tomorrow, and say - After our son is named, my husband will join duty. Till then, handle your kingdom's safety yourself. I said none of this! No?! Tanaji chose Kondhana's fight over his son's wedding. And you... You will return safely. For sure. I will be back before the special full moon. I promise. Take back your promise! Take it back. - But... - I said, take it back! Ok, I take it back. You are a piece of my heart Sleep now, like the birds in... Who is it? It must be your father. He said... he'll be back before the special full moon. It must be him. I know... it's you. Let me see you. Don't tease, now. You coming? I'm going in... and locking the door behind me. You'll be stuck outside... in the cold. Why're you making these sounds? Our child... Goddess... when we're terrified... we turn to you. I will pray and pray! Please keep that wolf away from us. Keep him far outside the village... forever. Heera! Chandra! What's up? There's a message from the royal kitchen... for the milk-women. What's that? Today, all the milk will go to... the king's kitchen. Say what? Tonight is special. There's a big celebration at the fort. And Queen Soyara... is supervising all preparations. This means... my precious cow's milk will go to the king! Let's go! Saguna, listen to me. Don't take this lightly. Ma! What happened? Don't ask! She was cleaning grain when... husk flew into her eye. O Lord! What now? Nothing! It will come out on its own. How? See how red the eye is? Show me. Saw? Don't neglect this, Saguna... or you'll lose your eyesight. C'mon now, Aunty! I speak out of concern and you snap at me! There's a doctor in a village nearby... who has treated eye issues like this. Now I must go out to get this out? Heera. Don't go back to the fort today. Stay with me, instead. My eye will be fine by evening. Ok, Ma. Hey! What's on your mind? Nothing. Nothing, really. One of my eyes is shut... but I can see from the other. Spill it. The milk we take up today.... will go to the king's kitchen. There's the special full moon function at the fort. And when were you going to tell me? No, no! You must definitely go up today. No, Ma. Can't leave you... Your king is your god, yes? And you have a chance to pay homage to him. And you'll pass up on it for a tiny flake of husk? Don't wanna pass up on it, right? Now do as I say. Heera... you go to the fort as usual. And Saguna... you go to the doctor's village... and get the flake out of your eye. I'll send my son with you. And listen... don't travel back in the night. There is an inn next to the Vithal temple. Spend the night there... and leave at dawn. Got it? And I'm here to watch your child. In the evening... I must attend a family ceremony By then, you'll be back, right? Right? Yes. This way, quickly! This way! Here! Careful, now. There's a doctor inside. Here. Slowly and carefully... Sir! What happened? What's all this? Our men were on a Janjira scout. A couple of them fell into enemy hands. But they were able to escape. It was a dangerous mission. Doctor? Yes, coming. It was an important scout. You saw... how badly hurt they were. They've lost a lot of blood. Janjira scout? Hey! Hey, where are you going? My husband, Jeevaji Rao... was in the Janjira scout. So... Ok, go check. My dearest... Where are you? You were to return by the special full moon. Goddess... please protect him. - Run! - That's the drum-roll! You're way behind, c'mon! Sir, excuse me... Shiva! Yes, sir? Did you bolt the door properly? Yes, it's bolted. Escort all those stuck here... to a comfortable inn. Yes, sir. C'mon. Let's go, lady. C'mon, let's go. Sir! Please open the door. What? Chief! Listen... to this one. Sir! Please open the door. And who are you, my child? I'm Heera. Heera, the milk-woman. From Raigadwadi. Aren't you Saguna's daughter-in-law? Yes. Go... Sopanya will drop you... to an inn. No! I want to go down. Now that's just nuts, ok? At sunset, the door closes... and at sunrise, the next day, it opens. It's the law of the kingdom. But... Don't worry. In our great king's domain, we have every comfort. There's a spacious inn at the fort. The night will pass easy, there. And you know... there's a special full moon function at the fort. Most of these villagers... are deliberately stranded here! Sir... how do I make you see? My baby... is alone at home. He needs me to nurse him. My mother-in-law is at a neighbouring village... and my husband is away on duty. Bheema aunty is babysitting, but... has to leave for a family... I beg you... let me through. At sunset tomorrow, the king may stand outside this door... and say - Open this door. But I won't open it. I won't budge from here. Open it a tiny bit. I'll slip out like a shadow. No one will know. Listen, child: The law of the kingdom is final. If, because of your story, I let you go today... tomorrow, it'll be someone else. He'll tell me a story too. How many stories can I heed? But, my son... Enough! Sopanya. Take her to the inn. Go on. Let's go. C'mon, let's go. If I'd asked my mother-in-law... to let me stay on here... you think the old hag would agree? But at home tomorrow, she'll yell at you. Then, I will say forlornly: I was helpless, Ma. The cannon fired and the door closed. And I got stuck there. She can't protest the law of the land! So you'll enjoy the party... and your ma-in-law will watch your brood of kids! Totally! There's saffron milk for everyone. Let's go, then! Sir! Sir, I want to go down. Down? I'm from Raigadwadi. My child is alone at home. If I'm here all night, he'll starve... O Lord! Is that so? But... after sunset, all doors of the fort close. I understand that... but my baby... Goddess Bhavani will protect your baby. Goddess Bhavani can't be everywhere... so she created mothers. And my baby... Sir... there must be another way. It's such a huge fort. There must be an approach... with no door, no lookout tower. But of course! On the west cliff... there is no barricade, no lookout tower, no door! There is no barricade, no lookout tower, no door. The king didn't make a barricade there... because the Goddess put a natural barrier there. A cliff. The cliff is so steep that... when you look below... your head spins. The valley below is the size of a village and a half. Because of the cliff's sheer drop... only the wind can come up... and water go down. The west cliff. Hey! Who's there? Who is it? Who are you? And what're you doing here? Sir... I'm Heera from Raigadwadi. I want to go down. Down? Yes... down. To my village. My home is there. From here, I'll... From here? From here, if you take four more steps... you won't go down... you'll go up! You know how deep the valley is? All I know is... my baby is home alone... and hungry. Will you leave... or shall I get the security head?! If you risk your life... the king holds us responsible. Sir... Go on, leave! Go to the inn. Off you go! 'I want to go down,' she says! Sir... forgive me... but my baby needs me. Complete Subtitles Exclusively Arranged by:- Samaksh ~ Varsha ~ Pankaj Jain Is this a celebration, Rao? We didn't get any milk. Just duty! Don't worry. Chief Bajaji is here! Yes, there's a celebration tonight... and thanks to our chief's generosity... we will also get... our share of saffron milk What say, sir?

We haven't had his naming ceremony yet. My husband is out on a mission. Once he's back... A brave woman has birthed this baby. There can only be one name for him - Jhunjar Rao. Gosh! Jhunjar Rao!
