- Which station? - The one in piazza sempione... - Under the arco della pace. - When? This morning, around nine. - How many of them are there? - Three. Excuse me. Yes? What? No, I can't right now. I'll call you back later. Bye. Tell me something, are these guys armed? They have a sort of cowboy gun. Actually, two... But they are plastic toy ones. How come you know all this? One of them's my boyfriend. I don't want them to get into trouble, especially him. They don't realize it's classed as robbery. Of course. You see this file? It's full of false accusations by jealous wives and betrayed husbands. You know how much time we waste? You know what a false accusation is? Wait. Listen, at nine in the morning... How much money do they hope to find at a petrol station? 50,000 lira? And they risk 10 years in jail? There's a few days' takings. - How do they know? - Luis didn't know. Blondie told him and everyone listens to him. But he's a good guy too and Joe is as well. I see. Luis, Joe, blondie... I need surnames and addresses. I need to see your I.D., too. Luis what? Luis is Luigi morandi, my boyfriend. Mario farra is the one they call blondie. Joe is Giovanni etruschi. Does Giovanni etruschi live here? Yes, he's my son. Who are you? I'm from the police. - Is Giovanni at home? - No, he went out. He went to study at a friend's house. Come in. Thanks. Are you sure he went to study? Of course. At least, that's what he said. Why? What's happened? Nothing, madam. Do you know this friend's name and address? No. Nuvolari, it'll be shut when we get there at this speed! I'll get blondie to drive. Come on! What are you doing? You're stopping for a pair of faggots? I'd understand if they were women! Are your preferences changing? Get a move on! That's a good idea! You get up, stick a number on your arse and go round in your pants, hey, Luis? And suspenders! Prof. Farra, if you don't mind, I have to wait for your son Mario. - Inspector's orders. - That's the most comfortable chair. I'd ask for a camp bed and some food. Go, Ringo! I'll introduce you to some pussy! Milan is like Chicago! - I do my shit here too. - Yes, let's all do our shit here! Al Capone! Mr. morandi is a widower. He's a salesman. He usually travels between Switzerland and Italy. His son Luigi doesn't see him often. When I've done the cleaning, I'm going. - Do you want a coffee? - Thanks. So I really don't know what he does when he's here. I see. Put the money away. They'll come soon, but we don't know where from. Should I be worried? Let's hope it goes well. Listen. - Are they in their positions? - Yes, two are near the cars. Two are on the sidewalk and two are near the trees. Tell them to stay calm. Guys, get ready. You know your positions. You two go round the back, I'm here. - Excuse me. - De nada, muchacho! - No smoking. - Sorry. Give me the money. - Hurry up or I'll shoot. - Really? How can you with that toy? All you can do is "bang, bang"! Let's go! There's police everywhere! What the hell did you do, you jerks? We're in big trouble now! Shut up and drive! - Get me away from here! - It was like "a fistful of dollars"! You know what your good guys did with their toy guns? They killed four men. Why didn't you stop them? You should've stopped them... I came to warn you. Where did they get those guns? Who do they work for and how many other robberies have they done? Come with me. Bastards! Tell me if you've seen them with these men. This one lives near you. - Have a good look before saying no. - I've never seen him. - This one sets things up, know him? - No. - What about him? - They've disappeared. - What about the road blocks? - This one sells arms. What shall we do about the road blocks? What do I know? They're dangerous in town. If they're caught in a crowd, it'll be chaos. Get after them and say I'm not around. - I'm off to the investigating room. - This one? Sorry, Conti. Nothing? Let's start again. This one hangs out around the petrol station. This one! Listen to this! This is great music! - Slow down. - What's up? Let's hit that bank. What? Are you crazy? He's right. With today's prices, it's better to Rob a butcher's! Blondie, Joe, forget it. You just have to stay here and wait for us. Once we're inside, you can go if you want to. Hold it! Get inside! Hold it, this is a robbery! Hands in the air! All of you! Get on the floor! Don't move. - Move! - Excuse me! I said don't move! What's going on? Shut up! Don't worry, calm down. How boring! We never get followed. Slow down. Close the window, you're sweating. - 95,100,110! - Well? Some loser has signed 50 cheques for 7,000 lira. He must have a broken arm now! Easy payments! Italians, buy today, pay the day after tomorrow! Half price bills! - Bazzardi records. - Hello, bruna? Please tell the boss I won't be coming to work today. No, I'm fine. It's just that... Listen. If Luis phones, tell the others too... If he calls, tell him I'm at home. Get him to call right away, okay? It's very important. Thanks, bye. There's been a robbery at the po bank, another dead man. - How much did they get? - 5 million lira. - They'll try to get out of Milan. - Get the road blocks set up. Yes, but out of the city! Why don't I split these? We'll use them to do our daily good deed. And he'll clear his conscience. We're so kind! Stop it. - Can you smell it? - Stop this bullshit! It's a miracle in Milan! Italian brothers, go shopping! It's on the house! Enjoy, proletarians! Women, buy your washing powder! Find out what gets your whites the whitest! Fulfil your stupid dreams, the recession is over! Maids, don't forget to buy your toiletries! Here! It's good, it's real! Look at them, they'd kill for a bit of money. Stop. Let me see your licence. Stop. Show me your licence. Tell lucio we're on our way. Go on. - Give me the car keys. - No, you'll wreck it. He's driving. We're going on ahead. - What a handsome chap! - He's a heartthrob! Mister, are you wearing your Dr. gibaud belt? Bye, Latin lover! You idiot! - Holy cow! - Can't you see? Look at that I There are a few things I need to know. Who your son's friends are. Where they usually go. Even a small detail can be of help to us. For example, if you remember a phone conversation. Or if someone came to visit recently... Maybe someone you've never seen. Excuse me for asking, but... These kids live with you. They're your children... And you know nothing about them. - What planet are you from? - Your one, why? No, you don't know where you are. You don't know how much it costs to run a house, a maid... To pay for studies... To pay for smart clothes to impress clients. And the car? I either look after them or provide for them. Does one thing exclude the other? Do you feed kids or love them? I've got a kid and a house, too. - Maybe you'll tell me what to do. - No. I can't tell you what to do because it's too late now. But I could tell you what you should have done. In theory, we're all good, but then... I might come across as being rhetorical. But when you choose to have children... You're taking on a responsibility. Not responsibilities like a car, clothes, a maid... Or that bullshit. Sorry. I'm talking about moral responsibilities. The simplest ones like talking are often the most difficult. Talking to your children, listening to them. They need to tell us what they think, what's going well and what isn't... What they believe is right and wrong. When you don't talk, the problems start. The weakest ones use drugs. The more violent and disturbed ones start killing people for no reason. - Are you justifying them? - No. Excuse me. What? - The public prosecutor is here. - I'm on my way. As a matter of principle, I can't justify anyone. No citizen or political concept that forces others to think the same as him. And neither can I justify who creates these monsters. If your son is a monster, it's your fault for not having given him the necessary love and support. I'm in a difficult position now. I have to get rid of him to prevent him from hurting other people. I'm only sorry about one thing... There's no law that punishes parents like you! Lucio! Open up! Lucio, open up! Open up! Move your arse! Doesn't he look great? Your tits are out, what about your bra? At last! Here's the super-stud! I take my hat off to him! Tell the village idiot to stop talking bullshit. You know he hates waking up early. Don't open your windows or make noise. The neighbours are servants. Show that idiot what a toilet is, or he'll piss on my floor! - Get something to drink. - I'll get it. Lights! I'll make something that" knock you out! Thunder and lightening, listen to that beat! This is what I call music! - I bet my bike you'll fall over. - You've already lost it. I'll drink the whole bottle this time! - Alcohol! - It's got two "o" s! - I mixed up ten different bottles. - It's disgusting. I'll tell you where I'll shove it! You've got the stuff and you're not telling me? Are those supposed to be equal parts? Hide it, lucio's coming. What's happening? - Who are you calling? - Lea. You couldn't resist! Say hi. Hello bruna, it's Luis. Is Lea there? Come up, there's food! It's a special food, for cocks! - Stop it. - Why? You're so stupid, collection arms are declared. You're right, sorry. Don't just stand there, give me a hand. I'll kiss you everywhere! Open your legs! Do you want to get down to serious business? Nice boobs, calm down! - I've had enough, stop. - Come on! Let's all come! - I love it! - Leave me alone! - Don't be rude! - You're so good! - Who was it? - How gross, it stinks! Have you eaten rotten eggs? - It was you, wasn'tit? - Stop it, you dirty swine! Get rid of wind, it's good for you! He confessed! You stay at home, I'll call you as soon as I can. I told you, at a friend's house. You don't know them, I'm going now. Please, listen to me. Drop everything and leave. I have to go, I'll call you as soon as I can. Please, wait. There's something I must tell you. I have to go now. No! Where are you going? Who with? Bye. Just in time, inspector. The guy called from here. Petrus, the wank that's really good for you! - Come here! - Don't tie it tight! Come on, ride! Good horsy! Stay still, let me break you in I I'm not coming. If you leave me now, you're a swine. Aml? You never shot and I'd say that. You knew nothing and I'd say that. I don't walk out on my friends. I never walk out on them. She fell! Not now, what a bitch! - Stop, you're hurting me! - Stop, go and get dressed. You give too many orders. Haven't you read Freud? Those who can't get a hard on, give orders. That's enough. Get dressed, we have to go. Hello, beautiful! Tidy up before you go out. Turn off the lights and close the door. Look in the garden, look everywhere. - There's no one upstairs. - Inspector, come and have a look! There's no one here, but it's full of arms. She needs an ambulance. Where have the others gone? - Who are you? - Where have the others gone? To get screwed! The entrance is on the other side. Sorry. Don't move! Get on the floor! Don't move! Move! Get out of the way! Go on, I'll finish off here. Don't run away, you idiot! Go and see why my guys aren't coming out. Yes, sorry. Go on. Is it ready? Washed and greased. The bikes are ready too. I'll come and get them later. How much is it? 5,000 lira. Here. - Thanks. - Goodbye. I don't know the other four. Luis has never mentioned them. - I didn't know of the villa either. - You're boyfriend's a stranger. Do you have to tell you what I don't know? My world is falling apart and you keep asking me the same questions. Ask yourself these questions! Ask yourself why they're angry with the world and behaving like madmen! Why are three well-off guys robbing, killing and risking their lives? But you don't ask yourself that. You can catch them alive but you shoot as soon as you see them, because you're afraid of the answers I! Leave me alone, I've done my duty. Go. - Listen... - Leave me alone. Just go, what do you want from me? If he calls, keep him on the phone. That way we'll catch him alive. But remember that the dead officers didn't have time to ask questions. Let's go to Lea's. - It's safe and you can get changed. - It's dangerous. I want to keep her out of this. Sodol. We're checking all the exits, but there's no sign of them. If you get any news, contact this car directly. - Any news? - Complaints about the road blocks. - What do the papers say? - "The police search in the dark." You stay here and keep your eyes peeled. They'll never come here, it's against all rules. - Can you stay here and keep watch? - Yes, sir. - I'll have a St. Antonio. - Right away. - Give me a token too. - At the till. Are you crazy coming here? Why? What's wrong with this place? The radio said some people were killed, why? He didn't shoot. What about you? Are you murderers all of a sudden? Don't moan! There's enough for a year of the high life here! How? The police is looking for you everywhere! We can go to the ocean and surf like in the carousels! Shall we split it? Yes, once we're in a safe place. We need a bag. Darling, I don't care about them. But you... it's unbelievable, terrible. Please, not now. You're very nervous, did the police contact you? - No. - Are you sure? - They called. - Who? - An inspector. - When? I don't know, about... - Ten minutes ago. - What did you say? Nothing. You said "nothing" to the police? What did he want to know? Where you were. She told him, let's kill her. Stop it! Say the truth. - He came here. - Let's go. It's dangerous here. - What about the passports? - We'll go and get them. She's coming with us. - Why? - I don't trust her. We agreed to keep her out of this. She got herself involved, from the start. Isn't that clear? If the boss says it's clear, it's clear... Even if it's not clear... Is that clear? The police serves the citizens! No more passports. We don't like what you did. Count yourselves lucky if we forget you came to us. It's murderers like you that ruin us. You're right, sorry. Goodbye. Drive. You'd better get caught by the police, or you'll get killed. The gangsters give their orders! What are you doing? Where are you going, al Capone? The sooner you die, the less you'll worry! Stop! - You're mad! - Calm down. Stop it! Grab everything. They can't get out of Milan. Inspector. There's an unauthorised demonstration in piazza del duomo. - What shall we do? - What do I know? Call the police. Come here. There's an innocent girl with those three, be careful. Let's take the by-road. There'll be road blocks there too. - There only big on the motorways. - Let's go to the country. They stop sheep there. Show me your licence. And your wool permit, please. Let's go. Go forward a bit. Let's walk. You go that way. You're coming with me. Luis, come on. Get a move on. Look over there. - Leave me alone. - Stop. Jump if you can. Come on. Stop, please. What an idiot I do you want to kill yourself with my car? What are you doing? Are you mad? What do you want? Get out. Come out, you dirty git. - He's hurt himself I - Don't move or it'll be worse. Gettin. Don't move. The last time you screwed her you left her your balls. Help I police. Quick, they've taken my car. They've stolen my car. Calm down. What car? Who were they? A Ford. Milan, b12337. - They're all young. - Call the station. I didn't see them properly. They pointed a gun at me. Car 24 to 25, Roger. Take the main road. Go on. 40 centimetres on from the box on the right. Inspector. There's a call. They've stolen a car, we have the details. I'm on my way. Police. It's them. The police aren't slowing down. You idiot. Go faster. And now for part two of "the great escape”. Slow down, we're losing them. Four goes, 200 lira I half-price for soldiers and kids. The merry widow's waltz. Missed. Can you stop at a bar? I need to make an urgent phone call. Shit, you're good. What a relaxing day, it's almost boring. You did it, fittipaldi. Well done. We're almost out of petrol. We have to leave this car anyway. But this time, we're hiding it. Stop. Stop. - That should do. - Yes, let's steal a tractor. Is anyone home? Countrymen. Villagers. Hillbillies! Hello. Come out. Hoe workers. Italians. There's nobody here. - What shall we do, boss? - Bring the car inside. I'm taking the carriage into the courtyard, madam. Forgive me, madam. Lea, come here. What do you think blondie's got in his hand? The lady forgives me, right? I'm coming to the swimming pool too. Listen, you have to go. - I'll speak to blondie. - Do you need his permission? I'm hungry. - Let's go. - Where? To the nearest town, we'll get another car. We might have to walk for miles and Lea won't make it. She'll make it. Just imagine you're going to the police station. Why would Lea go to the police station? You don't say? Come on I do you want me to carry you? They're setting up more road blocks. We look like a procession, shouldn't we split up? Come on. - Don't push. - Come on, cute bottom. Come on. Under there. Blondie, have you got your anti-aircraft artillery now? Take your shirt off. Come on. Come on. Hurry up! Let's go. If they won't leave, he'll have to screw her. Let's go. Blondie's not bad. That wasn't the worst thing. I just hope they kill you soon, you're crazier than them. - You're worse than them I - Let's go. We'll spend the night in the woods, the police will back off tomorrow. Obey him. - When did you find it? - An hour ago, I come here everyday. With all these tramps I when I saw the car, I thought it was a couple. You get all sorts here. They come from far away too. I know, it's a bother. We'll send a breakdown lorry to get you. Go with him to give your statement. I hope it won't take long. Yes. Nothing there, either? Alright, thanks. - What do you think? - They didn't pass any road blocks. No other cars have been reported stolen for now. I'm sure they're on foot. Get in the car. Hurry I go this way. On the back seat too. Go. That's it, my beauty. Hurry up, come on. You too, hurry up. Corporal, what's he doing? Are they going for a piss? Let's go. Let's stop here. I'm so hungry I'd eat a policeman in his uniform. A camping honeymoon. Faggots. I'm not going anywhere with you. Don't insist. All you can do is judge. I told you I won't take a cent. - I'll leave him the arms. - Do you think that's enough? You're sick. You thought you were god when you were driving. You felt important and powerful. And I saw how you blondie looked at each other. You love each other. Don't get me wrong, that would be too simple. It's a more subtle thing with you... It's weird, it's a mental game. Darling... I just regret one thing... That I loved you and that I still love you. But believe me, there's no hope for you. Just like them, you're already dead. Do you understand? Dead. It's over. It's two campers cooking. Me and you will go. We'll tell them we're lost and hungry. If they don't give us anything, we'll help ourselves. Blondie, stop giving me orders. Do what you what, but without me. Me and her are going. Well done, you convinced him. But you'll have to kill me first. - That depends on you. - On me? Shit, no I you take part in robberies, but then you feel bad and need comforting. You know how to drive, but you hate being followed. You've come to destroy the world but you won't go through a red light. Do I have to tell you to shoot me? You want an order? Shoot, you dickhead. Shoot I You're more than just sick, you're gross. Let's go. Joe's waiting for us. Let's go. At last I they're eating everything. They'll take the plates away soon. Come on. Good morning, guys. Did you smell the food or hear the music? It was the food, actually. My name's obrawalde and this is my son, David. It will be a pleasure for us to help you, if we can. We don't have much food, we didn't expect guests. I'm a disaster as a cook. But the place is nice. My son and I come into the woods to study botanics and animals. You don't need to steal here, you can take everything, this too. Why do you have to steal? Take whatever you want, don't be a thief. Just ask. Leave him or I'll kill him. You heard me? I'll kill your son. Let him go. Or I'll kill him! Hide them in the bushes quick or I'll kill you too. Drag them. Drag them. These woods are a nature reserve. The signs say no entry. We didn't see them. If you fine us, we'll pay. How will we get out? We're lost. I heard gunshots. - It must be the hunters. - They were gunshots. We saw some campers, it could be them. That father and son are researchers. They have a permit. Do you have your ID.? We've left it at the hotel. You'll have to come to the station and call the hotel from there. Let's go. Are they campers? We've found a tent. You, down there. Spread out. Look around. Come on. Hello, can you hear me? Are you receiving me? Tell them to call the forest rangers. Rinaldi, ask for a list of the campers. It's a mess here, something bad's happened. Yes, I think you're right. Inspector there are some bodies here. Good boy, leave it let's go. Christ, why? Sasha go Leave him, come here - you need a guide to get out. - You have to know the place. It ends up behind the refuge. Let's go. Get a move on. We found three bodies. Mr. obrawalde and his son. 0, b, r, aw. A, I, d, e. The third body's one of the suspects. Giovanni etruschi, called Joe. Now I want road blocks all over the area. Alright, I'll tell headquarters. You know what to do. We'll wait here for you. - I say we can do it. - I hope not. - Listen to me. - I won't listen to anything. And you do as I do, I don't even dislike you. I'll just ignore you. - There's a body over there. - Inspector, come here. This way. Send the dogs away. You go ahead, inform headquarters. He's still warm. Lea, no I This time I'm going to kill you. Well done, you saved her from the monster. I congratulate myself. You've got your balls back. Slow down. Slow down, I want to kill you. He's coming down like a madman, shoot the wheels, but keep down. Goon - go. - Let them through get ready to move Give me a cigarette. Here they are. Inspector, they're coming Where's the cigarette? - Here. - Light it for me.
