- What are you worrying about? It's gonna be great. - Well, what if Stonecipher finds out? - Oh right, like old man Stonecipher's gonna be working late. That's why he own the company, remember. So he doesn't have to stay after hours. Besides he'd never pay himself the overtime. - What if somebody tell him Larr? - Look, the only person in the building that late Is Gus the night watchman, okay. I've already worked everything out with him. I'm telling you, it's gonna be the best bachelor party that you've seen. Don't we have to send Gary off in style? - Well yeah but, you know, I just don't want to lose my job. - Look, if something goes wrong I will take all the blame. "Don't blame Brian, Mr. Stonecipher. "I told him if he didn't take part in the party "I'd show you these polaroids of him and this goat. "Oh yes sir it's a particularly ugly goat "but he was very drunk." - I never did it with a goat. - That's because you could never find one. Okay, let's make sure we thought of everything. Okay? I've got the strippers ready. Mike has the booze. You have the grass. - Shut up! Jesus. - Well, howdy officer. Can we help you sir? - You boys wouldn't be planning anything illegal, would you now? - No sir, we would never do anything illegal. - You just see that you don't. - Yes sir, officer. - You boys stay out of trouble, you hear? - Yes sir, officer. - Yes sir, officer. - Wow, if that's not an example of inbreeding I don't know what is. - Damn that cop was weird. - Brian, you really need to switch to a decaffeinated buddy, he's just messing with us. If he wanted to bust us he could have. - What do you mean? - I mean, you have marijuana in your briefcase. - Shh! Now, he would not have known that had you not told the entire world, Larry. - Of course he would have. Cops can smell that stuff from a mile away. - Really? - They take a class in it. Smelling 101 it's taught by a German Shepard. I'm just kidding, chill out, take a chill pill or something. Get yourself out of your hair all right. - I just wanna know why the hell he was acting that way. - Because he's an anal retentive cop who takes his job way too seriously. He's gone now just relax, okay. - Larry. - What is it now? What is this, the walking police? I don't think we're speeding. See that guy over there, he's going faster than we are and so is that guy. If anybody gets pulled over it'll be him. Uh-oh illegal U-turn, oh officer, officer. - Keep it down, I think it's the same cop from the donut shop. - Who, officer inbred? - He's following us. - I don't think so. - He is. - Okay wait a second, let's see. This is silly, I'll ask him. - No no no. Hey, officer! - Jesus. Oh officer inbred are you following us because you smell my friend's illegal doggy bag? You know, I don't think that's very funny. I dumped the pot. You mailed the dope. To who? I don't know, Grandma Moses. - Aw, goddamn, come on let's go we gotta get a move on. I can live without the weed, it's never done much for me anyway. Come on. Good morning Dolores. Good morning. - Good morning Dolores. Good morning. Hey hey hey, you all ready for tonight big guy? - Oh yeah, I'm all set. I already told Ingrid I was working late tonight. Hey, you got the girls? - Oh yes. We are sending you off in style partner. - This is great, this is great. Ingrid darling, I love you. And in two weeks I'm gonna be all yours but for right now there's a few thing you shouldn't see. - Michael, my man, I believe you're in charge of refreshments for tonight's little get together. - Funny, I don't recall being given that assignment. Let me check my files. - Whoa, you think you got enough there Mike? - You can never really have enough. - Oh yeah. - Larry, it's Stonecipher. - Ah, thanks Brian, this is just the file I was looking for. Morning Mr. Stonecipher. - Coffee. - No thanks. What a nice man. Yo Tony, are you staying for Gary's bachelor shindig tonight? - I don't think so. I mean I'd like to. But I sort of had a prior commitment. - Oh Tony say it isn't so man, it's gonna be a blast. We've got strippers, we've got refreshments filed under B for booze. - I'd like to but I gotta do something. Next time. - Okay, next time Gary gets married. - Stop it. - You know, we can still work late tonight. - I don't enjoy having an audience. - The party's gonna be upstairs. I mean, we can't do it on Stoneciphers desk like you wanted. But we can do it down here. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. You know, we can make some interesting copies. - You are so kinky. It's a date. - Yeah, do you have cherry chapstick? Can I call you back please? Larry. Larry, don't look now but you know that gorgeous girl from accounting? She's right over there. You know with the niceness. You're Sharon Wells from accounting. - And you're Norris the Veen from the land of Obnactigon. - Wait a second, aren't you from Ohio? - I see that my reputation precedes me. My friends call me Larry. - Well it's nice to meet you Lawrence. - May I be so bold as to say that you look absolutely lovely today. - Well gee, thanks Larr. That's awfully sweet of you. Why, you don't look half bad yourself. - Mike, you idiot, I was talkin' to Brian. What are you doing for lunch? - I thought I'd eat. - Ah, what a coincidence, me too. Why don't we do it together? - Well actually Lawrence, I already have plans today but why don't you take Brian here he does look lovely today, if I may be so bold. Excuse me, thank you. You know you can act all cool and everything but you know something? You're gonna be thinking about me, I can tell. - Is that so? - Granted, they may not be nice thoughts but it's a start. I'm not gonna let you forget about me. - I'll take shock treatments Lawrence. - All right Big Tony, way to go buddy. Hey, do you mind? I just need to make one copy. Al right. Thanks guys. As you were you two, have fun huh. - Just, what are you doing Larry? - Here we are, Wells comma Sharon accounting third floor extension 3333. Just sending our Miss Wells a gentle reminder. - You know, you might wanna watch yourself Larry. She's quite the jock from what I hear. - Oh yeah? - Yes. She's the leading scorer on the softball team. She might break you in half Larr. - Ah, but what a way to go. Maybe I should check that number. How are you today Mr. Stonecipher? - Stop kissing my ass. - Oh God, another long wonderful romantic evening. - Goodnight Mr. Stonecipher. - Goodnight Mr. Stonecipher. - Goodnight Mr. Stonecipher. - It's quitting time and I don't pay any overtime. - Well that's okay Mr. Stonecipher. We just have a little work to finish up. - Suit yourselves. Goddamn assholes. Brown-nosers. - Come on. Yeah! - All right Mikey party time. - Okay, okay, okay, okay. - Wait a minute, let's make sure. Ladies and gentlemen, Elvis has left the building. Party time, party time! - Larry! What is it? Come take a look at this. What, Is he coming back? No, I think it's that cop. - Officer inbred, no way. Who and what is an officer inbred? Just this cop who hassled us this morning at the donut shop before work. And he's down there? I don't know, where is he? He's right there. What that car down there? What makes you think that that's officer inbred? - Look, he followed us earlier. He might have followed us to work. Followed you, why? - He didn't follow us. Brian just has an over active imagination. Some cop car parks behind us today we we're walking, right, so Brian decides that it's the same cop and he's got some personal vendetta against us. So Brian gets so excited that he takes the grass we had and he mails it to somebody. We just don't know who. - That cop was acting really strange in the donut shop. - Brian, he's a cop. He shoots at people for a living. Chances are he's a little bit strange just forget about him. - What's he gonna do Brian, roll down his window, shake his fist and shout up at us. - "Hey you kids up there. "You're having a party after hours aren't you? "Okay, come one down we're gonna take you to jail now." Now, if you'll excuse me I'm going to procure us some feminine entertainment. Mikey. Women, women, women, women, women, women, women! Yay, women yeah, yeah! This is great. Come on, loosen up will ya? Come on you guys. Oh my God. Holy, check that out Gus, what do you think huh? Shame on it. We are gonna have some fun tonight, oh yes. All right, all right, time to rock and roll. Hey, thanks Gus. - No problem. Just don't burn down the building on my shift. All right, yeah. Are you lovely ladies ready to party or what? Oh always ready to party. We'll see. - Which floor? To the top of the shaft - Oops silly me, now it's gonna take forever to get all the way up. Oh, I wouldn't bet on that. - Are you sure they're only going to be on the top floor? - Of course baby. Maybe we should go down a couple of floors. - Okay - Just to be safe. - All right. Howdy officer. Can I help you? - Got a call about some disturbances at this address. Is everything okay? - Oh sure, everything's fine. It's been quiet as a graveyard. - Ah, well. Probably just a crank call. Sorry to have bothered you. - Ah, no trouble. - Is that the game? - Oh yeah, it's the bottom of the ninth. - Would you mind? I can't seem to get it on my radio. - No no no, come on in. - It's time to party old farts, let's go. - Ride 'em cowboy, ride 'em baby. - Do it baby, do it. Oh you are beautiful. - Oh this is great. You guys are the best, I love you. I love you guys, you guys are the best. Mikey, love you man. - Yeah baby, all for you Gary, all for you. - You know Gus, I saw you let those girls in here. - Oh sure, well a couple of fellas up on seven are having a bachelor party. - I don't think that would be in company policy. - Ah, how should I know? I don't write company policy. I don't even read it. - Hey, turn that back on. - I for one am sure that taking bribes is not in company policy. - What are you talking about? - I saw you take money from that kid. - Oh. He owed me a few dollars, so what? Now come on, turn that back on, I'm serious. - Well I'm serious too. I could run you in for contributing to the delinquency of a minor. - What minors? They're all over 21 up there. Now Jesus, relax will ya. They just having some fun. - Fun, fun? Oh yeah, it's all fun and games isn't it? Until someone loses an eye. I'll be right back. Why don't you keep an eye out while I'm gone? Seventh floor, going up. Linens, lingerie, eviscerated women. Who's that? - Hey man, did somebody call the elevator? - Larry, none of us were anywhere near that call button. - So someone called the elevator, so what? Can't you see I'm busy over here? - What if Ingrid found out about the party? - Hey, if Ingrid knew about the party she'd come up herself. You guys know who it is, it's Gus the night watchman. - Sure scared the poop out of me. - Yeah me too. Very funny Gus! Now, where were we? - We were right here. Hey, you know this gag's getting a little old. - Enough with the elevators already. You guys are starting to sound like a bunch of old women! I'll go down and talk to the guy and see what's going on, okay? - Hey, thanks Mikey. - No problem. Only, Larry, when I get back I don't wanna hear no more about elevators and I don't wanna hear this guy crying about his future ex wife showing up. We are here to party! - You're not going anywhere big boy. - Baby, let me go take care of this and when I get back we will have no more distractions. Hurry back. - Oh God. Hey Larry, what's this guy's name again? - His name's Gus. - Gus, okay no problem, I'll be right back. And don't do anything I wouldn't do. Then again with these girls I would do anything. Carry on men. What if Ingrid finds out about the party? Idiots. Oh. What the hell is this? Oh come on. Oh that's really funny. Come on. I got beautiful babes upstairs. Fuck. I really gotta lose some weight. I think I'll take the stairs. Yo Gus. Excuse me. Excuse me. - Oh, I'm sorry I didn't hear you come in. Is everything okay up there? - Yeah everything's fine. Well one of the guy's a little paranoid about his wife finding out about the party and they were wondering if it was you that sending the elevator up and down. - Well not me and I think I'm the only one down here. Wait a minute. Was it the one on the left? Yeah it was. - Well there you go. See, that one's been acting screwy all day long. Those assholes in maintanance forgot to put an out of order sign on every floor. I hope you didn't try to come down in that one. - Yeah well I did and I got stuck between floors, I had to crawl my way out. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Well just remember that, try the one on the right when you go back up it's working fine. And don't worry, I'm gonna get all over those assholes tomorrow. I got stuck in there myself last night. - Oh good, now I don't feel so bad. Okay well, thanks a lot buddy, see you later. - Ah. How's the party? - Oh the party's great. Ah, I'm sorry, I didn't ask you. Can I get you anything? Whatever you want, we got blondes, brunettes. - Got any booze? - We got booze. What's your poison friend? - Scotch. - Scotch, you got it. Guess you need a little something to get you through the night. It must be pretty boring the whole night by yourself huh? - Oh no. I've always been good at killing time. - Be right back. Hey, hey Mikey's back. Where'd you go? What'd he say? - Go, what'd he say? It wasn't him. The left elevator's all screwed up. It stopped between floors, I had to crawl to the fifth floor. - Brian take a note of that. Elevator on left bad, elevator on right good. I'll type up a memo. - I promised I'd bring him down a bottle of scotch. Don't worry baby I'll be back. Shit. - Sorry, this is a no stopping zone. - Man, am I glad to see you. Here. - Thanks. Going down straight to hell. By the way kid, thanks for the booze but I never drink when I'm on duty. - Man, Mike should be here to see this. - Yeah, where is Mike though? He hasn't been here for a long time. - He's probably watching the game with Gus. - Man, does he have his priorities screwed up. - Mmhm. - Wait a second, Larry. He might be stuck in the elevator again. - Then we got a better boy girl ratio. - I still think we should check. - Brian relax he's just fine. - Larry. Larry come take a look at this. - What is it now? That is weird. Who the hell would be sending us their chest? - Larry, I think it's that cop. - I doubt if officer inbred has a fax machine in his car. - His car. His car's still there. - Oh. Brian don't hyperventilate okay? I mean, think about it huh. Who wears a badge and coincidentally knows that we're up here? - Gus the night watchman. - Bingo, give that man a cigar. They probably were finishing that bottle of scotch and they decided to mess with your mind. See, what did I tell ya? - Look, you two guys are too damn serious. Now, here's what's gonna happen. Miss Lisa, that's her, and I are gonna go out and spend some quality time together. Besides, it's my party and I can do whatever I want. Isn't that right? - That's right. - Hey, knock yourself out big guy. Brian and I'll take care of these two lovely ladies. - Well you do that cause in the mean time Miss Lisa and I, that's her, we're gonna go out and spend some quality time together. - Hey you've already said that part. - Well, it's my party and I can do whatever I want. - Take him away, get him out of here. - You know, I'm beginning to suspect foreplay. - Oh my God. Ah. - It's not what it looks like. - Oh. It doesn't look like anything really. - She tripped, she fell and I was trying to help her up. - No, it was my fault I should have knocked. I was just looking for a stapler. Anyway, carry on. Have a good time. You know what I mean. - She tripped? - Oh great, the stapler. - Wait, wait. - What? - I got an idea. - What? - Let's go up to the roof. The roof? - Let's go up to the main roof. I'm so damn funny. - You're a genius. Sorry, you startled me. - Well hello there officer. Very nice night we're having tonight. Sure looks pretty out. - You little punk. You're drunk and disorderly and we can't have that. - Hey, hey, I may very well be drunk occifer but I am not-- - And what would Ingrid say if she could see you now. - Ingrid? - You're under arrest. You have the right to remain dead. Anything you say can and will be considered extremely strange because you're dead. You have the right to an attorney. Not a lot of good it'll do ya because You're dead. Do you understand these rights? Are you even listening to me? You're not being very cooperative. I hate to kick a man when he's dead they just don't put up much of a fight. Please, put me down. - Well, it is your first offense. So maybe I should just let you go with a warning. - Oh my God! - You act like trash you get treated like trash. - Oh my God, oh my God! What the hell is it now? - I'm pretty sure that I saw a body fall passed the window. - A body? - That's what it looked like Larr. - I don't see any body down there. Perhaps it bounced back up. - Listen, I'm pretty sure that that's what it was. - There goes your over active imagination again. You probably saw a pigeon. - A damn big pigeon. - It was a mutant ninja pigeon. - What about Mike, where's Mike? - Who gives a damn? Are you actually upset that we have these two beautiful creatures to ourselves? - Well Mike could be stuck in the elevator again you know. - Perhaps your priorities are out of whack. Wait, that could be Mike right now. From Gary. - What the hell does this mean Larr? - Maybe he's trying to tell us not to drive drunk. - Shit for brains. - Well, now we know where Mike is. He's down in the copy room with Gary and Lisa. Do you feel better now? - Yeah, I guess I do get a little paranoid sometimes Larr. - Yeah, and the Pope is a little Catholic. Hey tell you what, since we know where they are why don't you run down there and we'll really get this party started? - Okay. - Don't be such a nene Brian. It's okay Brian, okay. It's okay. Get a hold of yourself Brian now you're getting freaked out by bad Rococo art. Is everyone decent in there? Well I guess that's a bit much to ask from you guys. Is everyone dressed in there at least? Mike. Gary. Anyone. Oh, terrific. Oh, where are you guys now? Oh, I got a really bad feeling about this. No. - Hey, welcome back Brian. Hey, what's wrong? Hey, are you okay? - What's wrong? - You look like you've seen a ghost. - I feel like I've just seen a ghost. - Well what's going on, where's Mike and Gary at? - I don't know but there's something really wrong. - Really, what is it? - You better come with me I'll show you. - I don't see anything Brian. I mean, the place could definitely use a little bit of tidying up. - Oh come on, look around. You notice anything strange? - Hey Mike has freckles, you know I never noticed that. - I'm serious Larry. - Brian I'm sorry. I don't know what I'm supposed to be looking for. - How long does it take to make this many pictures? - I don't know maybe five or ten minutes. - And look at these pictures, now does Mike look any different in any of these? I don't know. Is he wearing a funny hat or something? - He hasn't moved. - Yeah he hasn't moved, he hasn't moved one muscle. - What are you trying to say? - Yeah what are you saying Brian? - Look at the pictures, he looks dead. - Oh my God. - Wait a second, you're getting too excited about this. Look, I'll show you how he did it, okay? - Okay, yeah. - What did you do with my undies? - Tore them off in a fit of unbridled passion. - No I mean where did you put them? - I don't know, were you wearing any? - Oh no, I remember, you took them off in the copy room. - Oh yes, I remember now. - Well, will you go and get them for me? - Why me? - Well because you're the guy and because you're already wearing your undies. - All right, all right. A man's work is never done. Tony give me my underwear. Tony give me multiple orgasms. Work work work. - Well, I certainly didn't hear you complaining. -I didn't say I didn't love my work. - You know, adultery is still illegal in a lot of states. I'll bet that smarts doesn't it? Now, now. Wouldn't wanna have to separate you two. Now that's what I like to see. You're stuck together 'til the very end. - See. - The grain is different. - What? - The grain is different. When you make a copy of a copy the grain is different there's lower resolution. And look at this, look at this smear. - What smear? - Right there. - Look, there's something on the glass. - Oh my God. - And I suppose I'm imagining that? - It doesn't mean anything Brian. It could be strawberry jam. - And it could be blood. - Oh come on, yeah maybe if somebody got a paper cut or something. Come on, reality check time here. There are no bodies. If Gary and Mike are dead then where are they? - Oh give me a break. This is not Friday the 13th part infinity here. If there are any bodies in there they're not gonna fall out on me. - Then open it! - Okay, I will. - No no wait wait, I'm scared. - Oh come on, this IS ridiculous. Watch, I'll show you. Are we satisfied yet? There is no psychotic murderer running lose in the building. Get him off of me, get him off of me! - Oh my God I was right! I'm never right but now I am right! - Get him off of me! - Shh! I think I heard something. Oh God. Wait! Here, get in here! - What the hell are you doing in my-- - What the hell are you doing here? - Shh! - I'm working late. Who are they? And why aren't they dressed? - They're dressed, they're just dressed scantily. - Oh my God, you scared the shit out of us! - Well I'm glad I could return the favor. What's going on here anyway? I mean, you look terrible. - I was going um, how do I say this? - Mike and Gary are dead! - What? - Shh! The Killer is in the building. That's what we're doing in here. We're hiding! - Christ man, Mike and Gary are dead! - Oh no, oh no no no, wait wait. And the fucking night watchman Gus is dead. - Gus? - You remember the fax with the badge. - Oh shit! - What about Lisa? She was with Gary. - We're just gonna have to hope that she's okay. - Wait a minute, you guys are serious aren't you? Yes. - We found Mike and Gary in the copy room dead. - I'm calling the cops. It's dead. - Oh big surprise. That's a big surprise. - Okay, let's not panic. Let's just stay quiet, stick together and get out of the building. - Okay, let's go now! - Oh shit, I almost forgot. What? - Chloe Wilson and Tony Michaels are here too. - Oh shit. - No no no no, no Tony had something important to do tonight. - Yeah, Chloe. - Tony and Chloe are? - You didn't know that? - No, Tony's married. - So is Chloe that's why they're doing it at the office. - I walked in on them a while ago upstairs. We have to warn them. - Okay but if we do that we do it together. - No no no I don't wanna go upstairs please. - Wait, do you wanna go downstairs alone? - Can't we just call them or something? I mean they must have an extension or something. - The phone is out remember. Oh God. - Okay, okay okay okay, let's just go find Tony and Chloe and get the hell out of here now. - Okay, let's go. - Wait, wait wait wait wait wait, where the hell are we goin'? - I think it was room 10403 or something like that. Look, I'll lead, watch our back. Just one floor up, right? - I don't know. - Get your clothes on guys we're coming in. Oh my God. - Oh shit, man. - I said it before and I'm gonna say it again let's get the hell out of here. - Is everything okay up here? Oh, thank God, the police are here. - I never thought I'd be glad to see this guy again. - Oh, we got a call about a disturbance at this address. - Disturbance, disturbance! You can say that again, look! - Oh man. It's a sick fucking world. Who were they? - Chloe Wilson and Tony Michaels. They work here. I mean, they worked here. - And we found two bodies in the copy room. Plus, Gus the night watchman we think. - Well that would explain why he wasn't at his post when I came in. - And a friend of ours is missing. - A girl? - Yes. - She's probably the one who called the report in. She's okay. - Thank God. - Can we get out of here now? - Well, we don't know where he is right now. So the safest place for your folks is to be with me. - Do we know who's doing this? - Joe Vickers. One of the most twisted psychopaths we've ever come in contact with. Notice the pentagram. Vickers is a Satan worshiper. Must make him real strong "cause the last time we had to deal with him he got shot six times and stabbed in the stomach by a long wooden stake. And I mean all the way through. Kinda like your friends here? - And that didn't kill him? - Barely slowed him down. The kids that did it to him left him for dead and went for help and when we got there we couldn't find a body. We assumed he was dead. "Til the killing started again. - When was that? - Oh, just this evening. We found the body of your friend in the dumpster outside. - Our friend? - The brunette. I'm assuming she's your friend because all three of you are dressed a like. - Wait a minute. I thought you said she was the one that called this in? I thought you said she was okay? - How the hell should I know? What have I got crystal balls? - But you said that-- - I don't care what I said. Are you trying to impede my investigation? - No sir, I just wanna-- - Shut up! None of you is above suspicion. - I thought you said it was this Vickers guy. - No. You're confused little lady. Police officer Joe Vickers, at your service. Now, where was I? Oh yeah, I was gonna show you my scar. - Now! The cop's the killer let's get the hell out of here while we still have a chance. - I shoulda told you, I'll never take a desk job. - No! Larry! - Burn in hell you little nini. - Go! - Hurry, he's coming. - Oh girls. What are you running for? I'm just gonna read ya your rights. - Look out you guys, look out. Break the glass! - Dammit it's bulletproof. - Oh God. No. Oh no, oh no. - All right, come get it you asshole. - Where is he? I don't know, he didn't come out. - How are we gonna get out of here? - I think there's a fire exit somewhere. - Where? - I don't know, there's never been a fire. - Oh God. - We're gonna have to go look for it. - We don't know where he is. - I know he's not in the lobby, I can see the lobby. - Did he shoot the guys? I heard some shots. - I don't know. - Oh my God, he's gonna shot us, he's gonna shot us. - Not if we can get a way out of here. I'm going to look for another exit. You wanna come with me, you guys wanna stay here? - I don't wanna stay here. - Me either. - All right, all right, follow me. What do we do now? Let me think. - Oh sure, like, take your time. - Shut up Cindy. - We're gonna have to go back up to the third floor and try to get out through the garage. - Terrific, does that mean we're gonna have to take the stairs? - That or the elevator. Personally I think we'll do better on the stairs. Come on. - Let's go. - Come on, this way. What about here? - There's no way to get to the garage on that floor. - How do you know? - Trust me. - Drop it. Drop the gun. - Like hell I will. Let her go. - Oh my God. - Now I'll splatter her brains all over this wall if you don't drop that gun. - Oh my God. - You're repeating yourself dear. - Don't kill me, please don't kill me. - Look, I'm not putting this gun down. You let her go and we'll let you walk out of here. - You'll let me, will ya? Oh that's rich. Al right. Just to let you know that I'm a serious guy. Cindy! - Now, I will splatter her brains too if you don't put the gun down. But if you do I promise I won't shoot her. I've already reached my quota today. - Okay, let her go. - Kick it over here. Thank you. - Now let her go. - You got to listen more carefully to what people say. I never said I'd let her go. I only said I wouldn't shoot her. How's the party girls, having fun yet? Nice chaps. Come out come out wherever you are. Olly olly oxen free? You can run, you can't hide. Ah. Assaulting an officer, that's a serious offense. What are you gonna do now, call the cops? - No, I'm gonna send you back to hell you twisted shit. Whoops, silly me. I forgot to reload. Oh yes, this is going to be fun. - Oh God, I'm gonna have to do it. Oh God, oh God. - I'm here. Ding dong. Avon calling. Candy gram. Here's Joey. Come on out, I know you're in here.
