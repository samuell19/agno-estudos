Please for give me, Señor Mallek, but I do not agree with you. You idiot. I won't allow anyone to disagree with me. I shall arrive in Richmond tomorrow. I expect you two meet me in Tuca in a week. We will, Señor Mallek. You have your instructions to follow. If you don't obey them, Jack, you'll answer to me. Get a move on. Giving orders riding around in his fancy carriage. One of these days, this Mallek will answer to me. Take a room at the hotel. Get yourself some rest. I'll be with you as soon as I find Mac. Now, you got everything? Please let me go with you. Oh you're tired, Mercedes, and I have a long way to go. Come back soon, Clayton. All right. See you in a while. Well, look at that. Hey, let's have a beer over here. They ain't got any rooms left here. What is this? Did you talk to Mac? I was just sayin' to my friend here that a pretty little girl like you shouldn't be left all alone. No! Hold it right there. Throw them bags down. Nice and easy like. Don't do that again, Mac, not to me. If it weren't chewin' tobacco, I might not have recognized your voice. Clayton boy, you're a sight for sore eyes. How the hell are ya? I didn't think on seein' you for another week or more. Well you know I didn't have much time, so I took the shortcut up from Laredo. Well, you save your dollars? Yep, $4,000. Confederate? Yeah. Well, they're dollars, aren't they? Yep. They sure are, but they ain't worth nothin'. Pretty soon you won't even be able to buy a glass of beer with that stuff, much less a piece of land. Sit down over there. And the way this war's goin', that day is comin' soon. You must put in a lot of saddle time to get that money together. Three years, Mac. Workin' cattle trails from the Rio Grande to Houston. 20 hours a day in the saddle for three years through the territory of the Apaches and the Mescaleros. And so that's how they paid you. In Confederate money. I want that land, Mac. We already agreed on it. But not with those dollars, they just ain't no good. Clayton, listen now. Your best bet is to go to the bank and have 'em change that pile of paper into pesos, or those union dollars. Then come back here, and you got your land, all right? Mercedes. The only reason they wanna set the slaves free is so they can work from the factories up north. Those Yankees ain't no fools. I just wonder what they're gonna pay 'em, eh? I mean it's all the Yankees' fault. The whole war. Barrel, send someone for the sheriff. And a bottle of whiskey. Sure, what's going on? Mercedes, someone killed her upstairs. Who's dead upstairs. His sister's been killed. People get killed every day. I suppose you want us to stop our drinkin' just because your sister's dead, hm? Well. Self defense. Had to fire, he was goin' for his gun. You're mighty good with yours. Clayton, please, no more gun play in here, all right? I know you had reason to shoot. But that there Logan is, or was, the sheriff's brother. Seen this before? Yeah, it's Jack's. Jack Blood, one of Mallek's men. Hm, must've fell out of his pocket. He was here a little while ago with Harry Dunn. What's all this mean? You say, you found this pouch of tobacco right near the body of that, eh, girl? Yeah. Stop it! Now mister, you hear me good. I don't give a damn about what happened to your tramp sister. It don't mean a thing to me. The only thing I know is, you killed my brother, and I'm gonna see that you're in the ground before he is. You can count on it. Hold it. Hold him down. I wanna take a good look at him. I wanna see his face. If you know any prayers, you better say 'em now. Stay where you are! Get in the cell. Now listen. Your brother was drunk. He drew on me, and he's dead. You just forget about the rest of it, sheriff. And I'll find Jack Blood myself. Look who's here! Harry, Jack, eh, you two still livin'? How you doin', boy? Hey, you haven't put a year on since I saw you up north. Hello, Jack. How's it been, fellas? Just fine. Well, we're all here except Alan. Have you heard anything about him? Like always. He was in trouble the last time we saw him in Bridgeport. Had it out with the sheriff. When the sheriff got hasty, Alan got his feelings hurt real good. Eh, what you got to tell us, huh? We will wait till Alan comes, so we don't have to say everything twice. Yeah, he's gettin' old, he left all his strength in the last town, eh? A woman, huh? He ain't never gonna stop. Gets too much pleasure outta their hollerin', eh Jack? That's half the fun, boy. But you wouldn't know about that. Now like old times, I'm leading this bunch. Anybody want to argue about that? No, that's fine, that's fine. You're the boss, Jack. Ain't nobody ask me what I think. After all the time we spent in jail together. Ya'll got no gratitude. So, you're all under arrest in here. One of these days, he's gonna get killed. Come on inside, Alan. Well Berger, I see you finally deserted. Now just how did you manage to do that? I just told General Sheridan I didn't like the way he was runnin' the war. Well, the chickens have come home to roost, so let's get cacklin'. - Go on. - Let's do it. $50,000. That's gold dollars. We're gonna split it up even. That makes 10,000, boys, for each one. What do you think of that? No argument here. But what do we have to do to get all this money? Ah, just what I'd like to be told. How do we go about it? Shh, let the man talk. Well first, there is a man who needs a favor. He wants a man taken care of. And for this little job, he's willing to pay 50,000 gold dollars. Now as far as I can make out, it'll take about two days. - You sure that's all? - Must be damn important man. With that much gold, it could be my brother. When do we start? There's about three days to prepare a good plan with no mistakes, naturally. We hole up at Tuca, over at Mallek's. Soon as the works' been done, we all get our money paid without a bit of waiting. $50,000. ♪ Glory, glory hallelujah ♪ ♪ Glory, glory hallelujah ♪ ♪ Glory, glory hallelujah ♪ ♪ And his truth goes marching on ♪ Ready, aim, fire. Lieutenant? Yes, what is it? A man to see you. Afternoon. Here you are, sir. - You're a guard, eh? - Yep. They're in order. I'd advise you to be real careful. There's a lot of Yankee spies around here, just keep your eyes open. Thanks. Say lieutenant, did you see a couple men, one riding a gray? Must've passed down stream late last night or early this morning? Why are you looking for him? To kill him. Killin' seems to be the pastime around here. I ain't gonna ask you why. Garrett? Yes, sir? You seen two men, one ridin' a a gray? Well, I ain't sure about the color of the horse, but I did see two men, said they was goin' to Richmond. One wearin' a doe-skinned jacket? Yeah. Pretty sure he was. Thanks, lieutenant. Duke. What have we invested this year in explosives, munitions, and other implements of war? Three, 400,000. The balances tell a different story. Well, let's see. 30,000 rifles with two million rounds for sayin'. And 200 field guns with three types of ammunition, and... And more uniforms, tents, tent pegs, and other items. Well, I say we've invested more than a million dollars, not 300,000, but just look at that. General Harris retreated out of Savannah after making a deal with the North. On the front in Virginia, the commanders want armistice right now. Lincoln passed a bill and they started peace talks, you know what that means? Well, with this combat material bought at a million dollars, we stand to make a profit of 10% of the amount we invested. You think money is all we invested, you idiot? I've stuck my neck out to the limit this time. If the Confederates and the Northerners decide to sign a truce, we're ruined, you hear me? We're finished. What do we do? This war has to continue until every single item in that arsenal has been disposed of, and I mean sold, sold! Even the smallest item. But how do we go about getting rid of everything on such short notice? Somebody has to buy it, Duke. Maury. Maury, dinner's just. Jack Blood and the others'll get here around dawn. Don't be late. I won't. Good night. Don't move. And don't scream. I won't hurt you. What do you want here? Who are you? Doesn't matter. Help me get away from here. You could've kill me before. Why didn't you, mister? That's it. I want you to prepare something to eat for the gentleman. She's afraid of everybody. Come in, you're safe here. It's all right, Marisa. Listen. The Ross brothers are at it again. They'll probably keep it up all night. Hey, I'll bet the army's lookin' for you. So you're not a deserter. All the rest of 'em around here are. Well, here's a little supper. Yeah, we get Rebel and even a few Yankee deserters comin' through here now and then. What about Mallek? Mallek? This place belongs to him. Course he lives in Richmond. This whole place is run by Steve and the Ross brothers. Those two outside. But we used to have slaves here. They always did most of the work around the place. They all got away. All followed the soldiers. What about you? Housecleaning and plus that, I'm sent with the men that... That are friends of Mallek, to amuse them. Very nice, hm? Ever hear of a man named Jack Blood? Rides a gray horse? Yes, he's one of the men who works for Mallek. Why do you ask? Why don't you two run away? What for? Mallek is not one to fool with. Marisa even got as far as the border once. Just look at that. See what those filthy beasts did. Listen. Please say you'll help us. Help us get away. Wait. We'll give you $83, look. Now and then these pigs get good and drunk and pass out and we pick their pockets. Take it. And please, say you'll do it. Do it, and I'll even throw myself into the bargain. It's not Mallek I'm looking for. Not pretty enough for ya? Got enough complications. One thing at a time. Got something to do hereabouts. But I'll be back. Thanks for the food. Please be careful, señor. I'll try to. Goodbye. Here's your advance. Where are we supposed to meet? Outside of town, there's an old abandoned house. You won't see anyone except a column of soldiers every now and then. When do we do it? On Saturday morning, the fourth of April. That just gives you two days to get ready. It's not much time. 50,000 gold dollars says it is. Who are these men we gotta kill? Two generals, a Northerner and a Southerner, they're getting together to discuss the terms of the armistice. Two generals? Exactly. We got these things here. The boys look real happy out there. With them two women, I can see why. Maybe I ought to go out and... Leave the women alone, Jack. When you're finished what you're hired for, you can go to Durango or even to El Paso and have all you want. Pay attention to your work. All right. These generals are gonna be awful busy trying to talk and dodge bullets. I give you my word, Mallek. I never did like uniforms. Here it is, cold cider. Hey! Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Oh yeah! Stop that, oh dear! Let go of me. You shouldn't be doin' that. Bullets make deeper marks than whips. What's going on? Who's shooting? My gun, sir. It's kind of a habit. Who are you? My name's Clayton. I've known her for a long time. What do you want on this spread? Shut up, Steve. He asked you a question. What do you want? I just escorted 100 horses up to Richmond, bought for the army in Mexico. It's an opportunity to see Aloma. You know him, Aloma? From a long time ago. Yes, Mr. Mallek, that's the truth. When he came back last night... Quiet, Marisa. Get in the house, both of you. So you're a horse driver, are you? Good. I won't ask you whose side your on, doesn't make any difference here. A guest is a guest in my ranch. But I'll ask you to keep that gun holstered. As it is, good men are hard enough to find with this war goin' on. Where are you going, Clayton? Didn't wanna disturb you, sir. Sir. No formalities please. Robert, Frank, take him to the kitchen, and see that Aloma feeds him. In here. You trust him? - I've seen that man. - Sir. Nothing. He just looks like someone I saw, I don't know where. Don't worry about it, Jack. Get on your horse, and let's get the job done. Let's go, boys. Keep an eye on that Clayton, Steve. And get him off the place as soon as possible. I'll do it easy. A lot depends on it, so be real careful. It'll be as easy as fallin' off a log. Sorry, we haven't got much time. Hey, do we have to wear these hats? Yes, hurry. Here. Hey, how's this one look? You're too young for a lieutenant, get another one. Eh, try this jacket on. Come on, let's hurry with the uniforms. Hey, this oughta fit me. Eh, this looks like a pretty good fit, eh? Here, here. Hey, how do I look? It's tequila and water, it'll go a long way. Thanks. Will I see you again, Clayton? Oh, if I get another guide trip up this way. You found the one you're lookin' for, didn't you? How do you know? I saw your eyes when you were talkin' over there. Jack's the one, isn't he? So long. Let him drown, Frank! What are you waitin' for. Nah, let's have some fun, all right? It's been a long time since I've had some fun. That's one real good idea all right. He almost broke my hand when he shot my whip out of it. How about it, Robert? We're gonna give a good old baptism for him. I'm gonna take all your sins away. Kill him. We ain't got time to fool around here all day long. Now fess up, sonny. Can't go to heaven with sin on your soul, eh? Oh! Drop that gun if you want him alive! I'm warnin' ya. Let go. Let go! Well, who is it? It's me, Steve. Good. What'd you find out? Just what you thought, boss. Lee and Grant have finally decided they're gonna start peace talks. In about two days, they're gonna meet and set the plans down for the armistice. We better get our plan going right away. Jack Blood will have to leave immediately. Jack's at Red Horn now, Mr. Mallek. He's almost ready. He should be already on his way now! If he thinks I'm gonna pay for him to have fun, he's got another thing coming. This isn't a party, this is important! We've lost enough time. If those two generals don't die, I've lost a fortune. Every solder, whether Rebel or Yankee, means $500 to me. This has gotta work, no ifs, ands, or buts about it. Extremists on both sides will blame it on each other. The guns'll start again, we can sell the equipment we have on hand, and no one'll be the wiser. What are you doing here? Two idiots understand that. What the hell do I? And don't try to tell me you were cleaning. What did you hear? Nothing. Nothing. I caught her at the door, sir. She was listening to you. A little spying, eh? No spying. I didn't hear anything. A little listening. - I'll teach you to listen... - Just doing my cleaning! You spying slut! Stop her, Steve! Burn her tongue out! Come here! They're going to kill me! They're going to kill me! Come outta there, I said come outta there! Get out! Get out! Spyin', eh? Pity. Better for you to be deaf and dumb. 'Cause you might decide to talk some day, eh? No. Marisa. He's in there! And I want him brought out dead! Get him. It was Steve and Mallek, were talking. Said Red Horn, going to do something. Plan to kill, plan to murder two generals. Jack Blood is. Murderers, murderers, murderers! I hardly knew anything about her. Only that she was treated bad. By everyone. Murderers! Where are you going? Came back to warn you. Sorry about your friend. I asked you where you're going. You know, Aloma. For me to kill Jack Blood. Blood's a murderer. You don't have an idea where that man's hiding. Listen, you take me with you, or you'll be killed by those renegades. And to tell you the truth, Clayton, I'm scared. You gotta take me with you, please. Oh please, take me with you, you must. All right, come on. Let's go. Go back, go back! Don't be a fool, go back! Tired? Why'd you do it, Clayton? What? Why'd you save me? Why'd you do it? Guess I had to save somethin'. Why, sorry I did? Tell me, why do you wanna kill him? It's a long story. He killed a woman. A girl a lot like you. Did you love her? What? This girl, did you love her? Yeah, I did. Then she got killed. But why? I don't wanna talk about it. Look at those soldiers. Yeah. What branch of the army are they? Southern cavalry. You stay here. Take these. I'll have a look around. Explosives are loaded, Jack. They'll hear the blast clean up to Baltimore and back. Uh, it works, don't it? You bet it does. Once this explosive is set, you got 10 minutes before it goes. That's good enough. That's plenty. After this, I'm gonna have a good time with all the money I'm gonna get. You think we'll be able to get away with all them guards there? Don't worry so much. We escape in all the confusion it causes. We'll be gone hours before they get started after us. They'll never catch us. We will take a boat to New York and get lost in the crowds. There, nobody would ever find us. Well I'll be glad. This uniform is cuttin' off my wind. You'll get used to it. Get a couple of bottles. I need a drink. All right. And now, we'll go over the plans once again. Tomorrow morning, an hour before dawn, we'll be mounted and on our way. I want you all to listen to this, so there won't be any mistakes. This here, is where the two generals are. Understand? Right behind that is the front lines of the Southern soldiers, 50 yards away. There. We will come in from this point. Now once we finish off the generals, we will meet at the bivouac at Stony Creek. It is on the road to Charleston. This should go off like clockwork if everyone does what we plan, so if you got any questions, now is the time to ask them. How about you, Berger? You sure everything is... Good evening to you, gentlemen. Keep your hands in sight. I'm gonna kill you, Jack Blood. Who told you that we were at Red Horn? I'm talking to you. Speak up! Wanna be hard-headed? All right, boys. Loosen his tongue. Get on there, you. Do you wanna talk? Ha! I think that may have helped. Get on that thing! Get in it! Bring him over here! Come on! You gonna talk? The lantern. Outside, all of you. We've wasted enough time with you, Clayton. Now I'm gonna give you a little taste of what hell is like! Move it. Clayton! Here! Knife, on the floor. I thought you were finished. It's all right now. This isn't a courthouse. I know. Where are you goin'? Come on. Come on. Wait! What is this, eh? It's a safe place. You stay here. I'll be back. Clayton, I'm afraid to stay here, I wanna go with you, please? You can't come with me. I'm going after Jack Blood, and I'll need a gun. Go get the girl. Fancy meetin' you here. I swore I'd hunt you down. No one escapes from me, and you ain't gonna be the first, mister. Remember, I promised you a funeral. Well, now you're gonna get one. Just a minute, sheriff. I'm only after Jack Blood. I don't wanna kill anyone else. It'd be a lot better if you just let me go on my way. It'd be a lot better if you get what my brother got, mister. Remember what we're here for. Every one of you, make like soldiers, no mistakes. Yeah, don't worry. Are you the courthouse guard? Captain Mendez, 50th Calvary Charleston reporting as order for courthouse duty, sir. Very good, captain. How's things at the front? See much action? Enough, I guess. Howdy, fellers. How do you like your outfit? Fine, thank you. Well, if everything goes all right, I guess we'll have a home here at last. Ho, ho there. Now. This way, sir. General Carlson. President Lincoln has expressed the hope that General Grant and General Lee can bring this war to a swift and just conclusion. I've been authorized to present you with the terms of surrender. Major, the document. Yes, sir. Terms of surrender dated January 20th, 1865, Washington. First, the Confederate States of America will immediately disband all army and naval units. Second, all soldiers now held will be granted complete amnesty, and will be allowed to be return to their homes. Third, the Confederate States of America shall cease to exist forthwith, and a military governor shall be appointed by the president with full authority to enforce the terms of the surrender and to maintain law and order until such time as the normal governmental functions can resume. Sixth, in accordance with the Emancipation Proclamation, all slaves shall be freed without delay. They should be granted all rights and freedoms ensured under the Constitution. Seventh, all belligerents should be allowed to keep their horses, mules, and other beasts of burden for transport and agricultural purposes. Eighth, all persons military or non-military, North or South, should be treated with respect as citizens of the United States of America. General. I have the authority to present this document to you with the hope that. First, let me tell you, my superiors will receive the these conditions for referral to General Lee. The dates set for acceptance of the terms will be five days from today. That way, General Lee and President Davis will have sufficient time to examine, in full detail, all of the conditions. We feel that it's necessary for the meetin' place to be located near the front lines. Yes, I completely agree. That'll be left up to you. In Virginia. Shall we say, between Richmond and Washington? That belong to you? All right, Jack. Give me your gun. Your gun! The other way. Put it to your head. Fire. Fire! Again. Again. Again. Once more. Jack should be here any minute, Mr. Mallek. 10:10. Don't you think Jack should've gotten here? It's been long enough. Now have any of you heard an explosion? Something's wrong. You'd better talk. Well now, you tell me what's gone wrong. Can't you answer? Haven't you got one thing to say? So you won't answer a simple question. I should've never troubled with the likes of you. Dirty renegades! But if Jack doesn't live up to his word, I will personally see him dead, believe me. First he'll pay, then all of you. You won't get anything, not one red cent! We're takin' those dollars! Stop! Wait, stop! Don't, don't do it! 3,900. 4,000 Yankee dollars. Well, you went and done it. Why don't you tell me how you done it? How you get the money so quick? The wind brought it to me. Well it's all yours, Clayton. As far as the eye can see is yours. And the wind brung it to him. Some coffee, Clay? Bet you ain't seen this. Now I figure the war'll be over real soon. And every man can get on with his life. Did you read it? Can't read it, and I don't much care. Can't read, well I'll be.
