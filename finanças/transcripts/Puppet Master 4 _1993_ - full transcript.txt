It is known that those in the upworld ... ... are close to discovering our secret ... ... the secret Andre Toulon stole from us those many years ago. We must send our children to protect it. They will punish those who try to uncover our world ... ... our secret ... our power. Those who discover our secret must be stopped. The power is ours ... ... and ours alone it must remain. Well, I'll be damned. It did it. It works Yes? Dr. Piper, I have a delivery for you down here. It looks important. You want me to bring it on up? Sure, Stanley. That'll be just fine. Thanks. Okey-dokey. Advanced technology. Dr. Baker, Phoenix division, please. - Baker. - Carl, it's Leslie. - I think we've got a breakthrough on the Omega Project. - Really? Well, I've been running some tests based on our newest data ... ... and, Carl, it works. The robot's actually solved the problem. Guess I should've expected this. Jennings was ecstatic with the results his division has been getting. So, when can we see the completed prototype? We're working on that now. Any news from our boy wonder? - Not since he handed in that last set of data - Well, it would speed things along if he could have the sequences to the next level. He's working on it, buy you know how Rick is ... ... unless he needs some feedback or some little piece of equipment, we won't hear from him till the problem solved. - Must be nice to be a wunderkind. Me, I'm just happy being a garden-variety scientist with a job. You and me both, Carl. Goodnight. Thanks, Stanley. Just put it, I guess ... right there. I'll be closing up soon. Come on, doc. You say that every night. Ugly little thing, aren't you? Where'd you come from? Come on. Great, just great. Stanley? Stanley! Stanley! Come on. Yes, take her power. Draw her energy into us. Hello? Hey ... Wonder Woman ... How you doin'? What a coincidence. I was just sitting here with the hot air in my hand thinking about you. No, no. Just a minor surgery in Hermes. So, what time are you coming over? You know, if the storm comes in, you're gonna have to spend the night. You know that. Good. I'll see you later. Yes! All right, gentlemen. You know the rules. I want a good, clean fight. Standing eight counts aren't mandatory. No sucker punches. Now go to your respective corners. Let's get ready to rumble! All right. No more kiddin' around. Gentlemen, this will be a random numbers sequence test. Based on the gamma pi code series 000/3 Gentlemen, don't fear you might kick your butt. Go! Come on, guys. This is too easy. And we're down with less than 30 seconds to see which of the players continues to dominate the field. Wake up, boys. That was pathetic, guys. I mean, I'm not a track star or a basketball player, for Christ's sakes I'm a scientist. Not a good one. Using a random number sequence, generated by the gamma pi code series 000/3 has met with the same results as in previous trials. Once again, although the robots reacted with speed and efficiency ... ... their behavior was utterly predictable and stayed within the perimeters of their programming. They showed no signs of initiative or original thought. We're left no closer to the creation of artificial intelligence that could stimulate life. - Yes? - Sorry to disturb you, doctor, but you have a package here. What is it? I can't tell, sir. It's in the shipping crate. Bring it up. He shoots ... ... he scores. Hey! What the hell is this? - Hello? Bodega Bay Inn. - Rick? This is dr. Baker. You didn't send me anything today, did you? No, sir. There wasn't anything worth sending today. Why? I've just received something unusual, that's all. You know, everyone in the Phoenix division is awaiting you results, Rick. When do you think you'll have something? Sometimes I feel so close, I could just taste it, but ... ... whatever's gonna make the robots transcend their programming and think for themselves just isn't happening. Listen, doctor, I've gotta go. There's some clown outside ringing my doorbell. - I'll call you back. - Ok, Rick. How'd you get here? - What?! - Rick? - Susie? - Who were you expecting? I don't know, sorry. Some guy was screwing with my buzzer before. Never mind. I'm glad you're here. Rick, this is my friend, Lauren. - Oh, hi. - Hi, nice to meet you. - You don't mind that I brought friends, do you? - No. Friends? Rickster. Hug, no kiss. So you two know each other? You bet we do. We go all the way back to the institute. Susie, how can I begin to thank you. What's a place like this doing out in the sticks, anyway? Doesn't even looks like it's open. Actually, it's off season ... and I'm the caretaker. So, Mr. caretaker ... ... I'm starved. - Where's dinner? - Haven't changed a bit, have you, Cameron? - No, that's fine. - Let's take a vote on it. There I was ... pointing at the highest grades in this course's history ... ... and what happens? Along comes little Ricky Myers. The kid's got this mega huge IQ and in two months he's blown away every record I ever set. - Great dinner, Rick. - Thank you. I didn't know I was gonna be cooking for four. Sus, you've barely touched your food. Are you training again? I'm always in training. Susie's incredible. She's placed in the last three ironwoman competition. - Rick, Lauren's field is metaphysics. - Really? Who with? I've got a grant from the Hus Foundation for psychic research. This must be a good offer. What do you specialize in? I'm a channeler. How interesting. And, naturally, I'm working on something that may change the course of modern civilization as we know it. Naturally. - Dare I ask who you're working for? - I doubt you've ever heard of them before. I'm working with the Omega Project. Sounds interesting. - Care to talk about it? - Would love to. Classified. I mean, I can't tell you much, but ... I'm working in what's called the Phoenix Division. My team logs in data that's sent over by some hotshot over at Biotech ... ... some broad named Pepper. Piper. Her name is Leslie Piper. And how would you know that? Because the work she's testing is mine. Great wine, Cam. Cheers. I am here. I am with you. So if you're working with Baker and Piper, what're you doing up here? I needed some place private where I could spread out and ... not have anyone looking over my shoulder. I'd go crazy working in a lab. And when I can get him to come up for air, this place has the most heavenly view. Well, then ... how about ... showin' me your set-up? I mean ... we're still ... colleagues, right? Sure, why not? Rick, I don't mean to be rude or anything, but I know Baker and Piper are paying you money. Maybe you can take some of that money and we could ... Guys, wait. - Where'd you find it? - Cute. It was down there, by the table. What is it, Rick? I don't know ... ... some kind of mechanical doll. I found him in my room, when I moved in. Come on, come here. How can you pull enough amperes in this place for your set-up? It's so old. I've got my own generator. This is terrific. Okay. Mind if I sprint through your program here, Ricardo? I'd rather you didn't. Come on, it's not like I'm going to steal anything. I'm sure of that. What's this? Just one of the robots I've been running tests on. Hermes. Rick ... ... you saw the box this probably came in? Yeah. Actually, it's over here. I found it up here when I moved my equipment in this room. No, this can't be right. This isn't what the puppet came in. That's where I found it. But that's not where it belongs. There's a storage room down the hall. Knock yourself out. Hydraulics, maybe ... or an old-fashioned wet cell battery. - Actually, I took it ... - Oh, my god! Lauren? Lauren! - Do you think she'll be ok? - She'll be ok. She just fainted. Has this ever happened before? Yeah, every time I give her a hot oil massage. So she's ok? Yeah, she'll be ok. - Stay away from it. - What? The trunk. Stay away from the trunk. What's wrong with the trunk? No, don't. Shit. - Cameron. Cameron! - What? Give me something to bust open this lock. Do I look like Bob Villa to you? How about this? Will it help? Hammer? Guten idea. Any plastic explosives? Yeah, I keep them right next to my Scud missiles. What're you doin'? Would you stop it? Hey, it's a fifty-year-old trunk. He's not gonna ruin it. - Please. - Lauren, what happened to you? Now let me take a whack at that. Come on. Stop it, Cameron. Not until I see what's inside this fucking thing. Lauren's terrified of that trunk, Cam, or don't you care? Yes, of course I care. Lauren ... What the fuck are you so scared of? I just can't stand here and watch you guys do this. Hey, people are afraid of the unknown. When she sees there's nothing bad inside, she'll be fine. You guys play macho. I'm takin' Lauren into her room. Suzie! Women - can't live with 'em, can't shoot 'em. I am here. - Concentrated muriatic acid. - What do you want me to do with it? - Don't touch it. Jesus. It should be loose now. - Voila. - Ok. Ok. Let's open it. Wow. Look at those. Cool, huh? I'm a little disappointed. I was hoping we'd find L. Ron Hubbard. Well, we found something. - Jesus. - What? Look at who owned this. The Nazi? I hate those guys. This is some kind of a game board. The trunk's not evil. It just belonged to some evil guy. It looks like Ouija board. I used to have when I was a kid. Except the markings are a little different. Maybe there's something about it in this diary. Listen to this: With the death of Krauss ... ... the murder of my beloved Elsa has been avenged. For the moment, the secret of my magic and my puppets is safe. I must escape Germany before the Gestapo finds me, and the formula falls into the wrong hands. Von Kersting, the printer, will forge me a passport. So this Toulon wasn't a Nazi. The Nazis were after him. They wanted to know how he animated his puppets ... ... and he was afraid of what they'd do with that power. Duh. There you are, Uncle Fester. Looks like you, Cam. His name is Pinhead. That's Tunneler. He's Six Shooter. Appropriate enough. It's cute. What do you think this is? Maybe that's the formula Toulon wrote about. Wait a minute. How can liquid animate these guys? Maybe they just need a little gas. Come on, come on. This is so stimulating. Somebody pinch me. Let go of me. Cameron, wait. Don't! Don't! Don't! I warned you, guys. Let's just wait. Just wait. They're amazing. - Shit. - Cameron, don't do that. - I don't think they want you getting personal, Cam. - Easy there, Tex. He wants me to pick him up. Hi, bud. They're responding spontaneously. No. No way that a toymaker 50 years ago figured out how to do this, no. You realize what this means. That puppet master guy may have had the answer to the entire Omega Project. Everything we've been working for could be standing ... right here. What Toulon stole from me ... ... we must recover. Everyone around him must die. They must die. Listen to this ... ... I'm making that which is inanimate - animate. The metaphysical ramifications of this stirs my soul. To be as a God, a creator of ... This is a personal journal. There's no formula in here. It must be in there somewhere. Ok, here you go, little guy. It's not. I'm telling you. I've looked 50 times through this whole thing, and it's not in here. Come on, just use your imagination. Look for something that might be a code ... ... a clue. Think about it ... ... the secret to artificial intelligence. If you're so sure that the formula's in here, why don't you use your bigger-than-huge, mega-superior imagination IQ to find it?! Will you guys grow up? Dammit. Not again. Swell. Mood lighting. The lightning knocked off the power. It'll take a while before it comes back up. Don't you have a generator? Yeah. It's hooked up to my computers. Wait ... ... you're telling me this is the only light we have? What'd you mean, "we"? Your room is downstairs. Guys, why don't we call it a night? Yeah, okay, fine, good. Lauren, honey? I think you need your rest. Goodnight, you guys. - Goodnight. - They got awfully sweet all of a sudden. I should be so lucky. - Dammit. - Just don't worry about it, ok? Besides, you always take everything so personally. Personally? "Use your imagination"? Fuck him. We all can't be child-fuckin'-prodigies. Some of us have to settle for being ordinary, typical run-of-the-mill type geniuses who have to work for a living. - Cammie ... - Who does that little prick sack of shit think he is? He thinks he's so fucking smart. I don't think he means it. He won't let me look at any of his data. Practically accused me of planning to steal it. He never said that. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna find the secret to those little swine puppets. The answer's gotta be in the formula. Then, I'm gonna take it to Omega. And then, Baker and Piper and all the rest of them are gonna have to kiss my ass. - But those puppets don't belong to you. - Bullshit. Rick's had them lying around here for months. He's hardly even touched them. I mean, you're the one that kept asking about them. You're the one that found the right box. If it wasn't for your gifts ... ... he'd still think they were just ... dolls. He's been laughing at you, all night ... ... and me too. - Don't you wanna help me get what I deserve? - How? This. Ok, guys, let's see what you can do. What're you doing? Not every scientist adheres to standard methodology. Oh, really? And what is your methodology, Professor Myers? The standard test ... ... tends to be ... ... is it fun? All, right. I can hear you, guys. Stop your mumbling. No ganging up. Every man for himself ... or puppet. Ok, guys. Ready? On three. One ... ... two ... ... three! Not bad! Lauren, you can do this. I know I can. I just don't want to. All I want is to talk to this Toulon guy. And I don't. Look, you don't know the forces we'd be summoning here. If you could've felt the intensity of evil I sensed here Lauren, the only evil is in your mind. I thought you believed in me. I do believe in you. I do. That's why I want you to do this thing. Come on. Por favore. Por favore. Ok. Ok. Fast, huh? Get the door. Someone's at the door. Damn. Hello? Lauren? Lauren, what's going on? Talk to me. Shit! Sweetie, you all right? Whom do you seek? Whom do you seek? Toulon. Andre Toulon. Ah. Puppet master. And what do you seek to learn? The formula? The elixir. Yes, the elixir. The secret is within the pyramid. What does that mean? Listen, and you will learn. Shit! What the fuck is that?! Lauren, honey? I think it's working. Fuck! You guys give up yet? Rick. - What's wrong? - Listen. What? - That. - Shit. You guys, we gotta get out. There's something evil in here. - Fucking-a-right, there is. - Yeah, I'm terrified. Where you going? I'm gonna go see what's up. Psychic. Next. Did you guys come here to protect me? Thanks. Shit! Fuck this thing. - Wait! Will you just tell me what happened? - I'll fax you, when I'll be able to. Yeah, I can't stay back. - I can't make him leave. - Then it's his goddamn funeral. If you wanna come with us - that's fine, let's go. If not, I'm taking the goddamn keys. Hey, Cam, when did you start carrying a purse? Fuck you, Myers. You wanna commit suicide, that's okay with me ... ... but I am gone. Sus, come on. You guys are in real danger here! Thanks for the warning. Sorry about the evil spirits. Nice girl ... for a psychic. Go! Get out and push. What? - Get out of the car and push! - No! Lauren, get out of the car and push. Let's go. Come on! Fuck. Open the door. Open the door. Cameron! Open the door. Cameron! What in the fuck is this thing?! - What the hell is this? - Oh my god. I didn't open it. It was downstairs at the front door. I brought it up when you were working on the puppets. Susie! Susie! It got him. It got Cammie. What're you talking about? - It was in the car with him. - What got him? - He locked the door. - Sit down. - He locked it in with him. It got him. It got him. It got him. I'll go check it out. It's all my fault. Cameron! Cameron, can you hear me?! No! My friends, I am with you. The magic must prevail. Decapitron - his time has come. A little rumble, huh, guys? Way to go, Tunneler. He shoots. He scores. Susie, can she walk? I doubt it. Where's Cameron? We gotta get her out of here. What happened to your arm? Come on, we gotta go! Look. What are they doing? Exactly. The storm. They're using the power from the storm. Susie! Lauren! Lauren, don't! Go! Go! Go! Go! Come on. I am with you. The magic that gives my puppets life was stolen from the tribe of ancient Egyptian sorcerers ... ... who pledged their allegiance to the demon lord Sutekh. He and his watchers - his followers - will stop at nothing to guard their secrets. They are committed to your death and the deaths of all your followers. Project Omega. You've discovered the magic. Use it to protect yourself. - Guard the secret. - What secret? - The frequency. - Wait, wait! What frequency? Numeric sequence. The energy of life. You are very close. The magic is in the formula. Where is it? The vial! With the rest of the formula! Have you guys seen it? Cameron. Lauren? Lauren! Stay away from me. - Oh god! Oh god, you're ok. - Yes. - What happened? What happened? - Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. - Where's Lauren? - Rick, I'm really scared. I can't find her. She'll be ok. I got the sequence! - What'd you mean? - The sequence. The numeric sequence. Toulon spoke to me. Ok. Go up to the attic. The puppets are there. Ok? - Wait. Where're you going? - I'll be back in a minute. Get off her, you little bastard! Come on! Come on, you little bastard! Come on. Come on. Come on. What happened? Is she hurt? No, but she was attacked. I had to kill it. How many more could there be? You're bleeding. I'm ok ... but I'm not so sure about Lauren. Rick Myers, you must animate the Decapitron. Lauren? Who are you? Puppet master. Is this the answer? The Omega Project. This is what I've been searching for, right? Only the Decapitron can defeat the beast. Create an electrical field. The formula will generate the projections. Projections? You mean ... you mean linear projections? My god, that's what I've been experimenting with. You must transcend linearity. And that's the fifth button from the top. Ok. Let's boost the generator Come on. Come on. Come on. Back. Puppet, don't hold back. Showtime. Come on! Yes! All right, guys. On your marks ... Ten, nine, eight ... ... seven, six, five ... ... four, three, two ... ... one. Lauren! Stay back. Come on. Shit! I thought you just killed that little shit. - I thought I did. Shit. Yes! - Come on! - Do it! - Come on! Susie? Susie! Lauren, answer me. Let's get her out of here. The power of the magic has been set free. It now needs a wise master to channel and control it ... to keep it from evil. You have been chosen, Richard Myers. Protect the magic from those who seek to abuse it. It is time to begin anew. I am with you, puppet master.
