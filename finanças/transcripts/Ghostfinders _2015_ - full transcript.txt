Ghost sightings number in the hundreds of thousands every single year in the United States alone, yet it's a subject no one wants to talk about. Most of these sightings are inconsequential, but what happens when a ghostly presence threatens you or your loved ones? Who do you tell? Where can you turn? The Ghostfinders. Jared Baum Franklin Jacobs And Kat Evers. Together, they have decades of experience investigating paranormal activity. If you're experiencing a haunting, if you've got nowhere else to turn... when no one else will believe you... If you're experiencing paranormal activity or unexplained phenomena, call us. If there's a ghost in your house... we'll find it. So what do you have for us this time? I hear it's going to be a real challenge. It certainly looks that way guys. Here's the scoop: this one's right here in Austin - a beautiful old house out by the lake. So what's the story? Well, apparently the owners bought the place at a foreclosure auction a few years back. They started experiencing paranormal phenomena almost immediately. What sort of phenomena? You name it. We're talking sounds, visual manifestations, objects moving... They actually saw these things taking place? That's my understanding, yes. Have they attempted to do anything about it? Well, that's why they've called us. I don't have all the specifics yet, but the current owners are a husband and wife. From what I understand, they bought the place hoping to retire there... But the ghosts have made it impossible for them to do that... Exactly. Are they staying in the house now? No. My understanding is they didn't even make it a single night in this place. Well, if they've got a home like this out on the lake and they're not living in it, something must've really shaken them up. Most definitely. So we're going to need all our wits about us for this one. We've been to plenty of haunted places, but if the stories they're telling about this place turn out to be true... A whole other level. Precisely. So what's the plan? We're going to head out there and meet with the family. They'll fill us in on all the details and then we'll have the place to ourselves for the night. Sounds like it's time for a roadtrip! I'll pack up my gear. Let's do it! So any idea what kind of manifestations we're talking about here? Well, we'll get the full scoop when we get there, but from what I've been able to gather, I think we're looking at a potential class one phenomenon. Are you thinking Poltergeist? I'm most definitely thinking poltergeist. Yes. Are you picking up anything? There's definitely some pretty powerful negative energy going on... I didn't realize this was going to be so far out in the middle of nowhere. Oh yeah. Old, troubled history, isolated... it definitely has all the earmarks. Well, hopefully the owners can help us get a clearer picture of what's going on. - Harold Lawson? - Yes! - I'm Jared Baum. - Nice to meet you Jared. - This is Kat. - Hi, Kat. - And Franklin. - Franklin. - This is Mimi. - Hi. All right, well, we should probably get right to it. So why don't you start off telling us a little bit about the history of the house itself. Well, I'll be real honest with you, I don't really know all that much about it. It was built in the fifties, I think. I got it at a foreclosure auction myself. I see. Normally Mimi and I couldn't have even afforded to get a place out at the lake like that, but they were practically giving the damn thing away. Any idea why? Oh, yeah, they mentioned at the auction that the house had some sort of... trouble in its past. Trouble? Yeah, they didn't go into specifics and I didn't ask, but I got the impression that whatever had happened there was the reason it was going so cheap. People were killed there. That's right. Is that true? Yeah. Like I said, I didn't have all the details when I bought the place, and honestly I didn't really want 'em. I kind of figured the less we knew about whatever bad things might've happened there the better. But you found out? One of the neighbors told us. Yeah, well, apparently there had been an artist living there before us with his family. His paintings are still hanging on the walls there. Yeah, the place is still set up exactly like they had it. I was going to ask you about the artwork... it's... haunting... Yeah, all of that stuff was there when we bought the place, the paintings the furniture, the whole deal. That was a big part of the appeal for us. It was just ready to move in to. So what happened with this painter? All I can tell you is what the neighbors told us, but apparently it was some sort of murder suicide. Killed his whole family and then himself. Right there in the house. I figure that's gotta be why all this is happening, right? Exactly what kind of things did you experience there? Well, we only stayed there that one night... I didn't actually see anything myself, but I heard things... like someone standing right behind me, whispering in my ear... I saw something. After we went to bed, I was lying there with my eyes closed and I just sensed this... presence in the room... What happened? I opened my eyes and there was this figure standing right over us. A figure? Like a woman in a white dress, just... standing there, staring at us. I woke up to her screaming. It scared me to death. Then what happened? I don't know, she just kind of... wasn't there anymore. And she didn't return? Hell, we didn't give her a chance. Mimi refused to stay the rest of the night there. And you haven't gone back since? I've gone back once or twice just to check on the place, and we've tried renting it out as a vacation home once or twice, but no... I know it sounds crazy, but the second you set foot inside that place you can just feel it... Something's wrong in there. You said you rented it out as a vacation home? A couple of times. And how did that go? It was a disaster. I ended up having to refund the money. Hell, one lady threatened to sue us. She thought we were trying to harass her! Is there any way we might be able to talk to some of the people you tried to rent it to? Uh, yeah, I think I've still got their information around here somewhere. So tell us about the experiences you had at the house. Well, man, it was crazy See, me and this chick I was dating, We decided to rent the place out for the weekend. We figured it'd be a nice weekend. You know, just the two of us, we'd have some good food, some good beer.. You know, have a good time. Sounds like a good weekend to me. Yeah, well, that's what I thought. But? Well, as soon as we pull up she start complaining... she's not digging the vibe and she's kind of creeped out. You know, I'll be honest with you, everything seemed fine at first but as soon as it got dark she started really creeping out on me. I mean, with all the shit on the walls and what-not it is pretty scary. But it wasn't until it got really dark that we started to see them. See what? I don't know, like shadows or movement or something. Movement? Yeah, like - I don't know, like something running past me like the wind. I really don't know. But you never saw anything more substantial? Not at first. But then after a few moments we started to hear things. Like what? I don't know. Kind of like whispers or voices in the wind. I don't know. I know it sounds kind of crazy. Not at all. So it never escalated beyond that? Well, yeah it escalated. That's when we started to hear... like scratching sounds. Scratching sounds? Yeah like scratching sounds or something, I don't know, but she started really freaking out. With good reason. I'm not gonna lie, it was pretty damn creepy. See, she tells me to go in there and check it out. Like, what am I gonna do about that? So I go in there like three or four times. Every time I go in there, the sound stops. Finally, I go in and I look up in the window and I see in the reflection this woman behind me. She's got... something around her neck. A rope or a leash or something. A rope around her neck? Well, yeah. A rope or something. I don't know. Because as soon as I turned around, she was gone. And so were we. I ran in and said pack your stuff. We grabbed everything headed out in the middle of the night and never looked back. Worst weekend ever. Oh, yes, I've definitely seen ghosts there before. Really? Absolutely yes. With my own eyes. There is no doubt in my mind. What happened? From the moment I walked in, I knew that something was not right with this place. It felt... you don't have the word in English, but it just felt... wrong. Immediately I was seeing things in the corner of my eyes, like shadows only more... substantial. I don't know if that makes sense... Then after I had been inside for a few minutes I began to hear these noises... first it's like whispering or something... then a few minutes later, I hear this scratching, kind of rubbing noises all coming from down the hallway. Did you check it out? Of course I did. I assumed that someone had gotten inside - kids or something. I went down the hallway to where the noise was coming out of and I followed it directly up the stairs toward the master bedroom. The closer I get, the louder it gets until it sounds like a bunch of those same noises, all coming from this same place. Then the second I walked into the room, I saw it... It was just for a quick moment - one blink of an eye, but I most definitely saw it - it was not my imagination. What was it? I saw people. Several of them. They were all hanging from the ceiling in the bedroom. Sorry - let me make sure I understand you. So you actually saw people in the house? That's correct, yes. And they were... hovering up in the air? No. They were all hung up there from the ceiling. Such as with a noose... like the wild west. As I said, it happened as quickly as you can blink an eye and then it was all gone, the people, the sounds - everything. Then what happened? I immediately grabbed my things and left. I've never gone back. And you're sure about what you saw? I'm as sure as I am seeing you right now. Fascinating. Is there anything else you'd like to tell us? Actually, there is something else I would like to say, yes. You would have to be a complete fool to set foot inside of that place. And if the three of you know what's best for you, you will never go there. I've never come across anything like it before. It is very bad news. So what do you guys think? Well, these are certainly some pretty extraordinary claims. That's for sure. What do you make of that woman saying she saw people hanging in the master bedroom? Do you know if the incident they mentioned involved a hanging? I'm not sure. Didn't that other guy say he thought he saw a rope around the woman's neck? That's right. Interesting. We'll have to see if the owners can shed any light on that. Definitely. So, what about you, Kat? You picking up on anything yet? Well, it's really hard to say until we actually get out to the location, but I'm definitely feeling something. Well, I know this much - if we can substantiate any of these claims - the sounds, the visual manifestations - we could be looking at one of the most severe cases we've ever encountered. I agree. Okay, I think we've got a pretty good idea of what we're going up against. Are you guys ready to check out the house? I'm a little nervous, but excited. Yeah. Let's do it. Let's go. Well it's definitely isolated. A perfect place for a haunting. We must be getting close. I'm feeling something. Wow. Guys, look at this. The electromagnetic frequencies are all over the place. We're here. Well, here we are. This place gives me the creeps. Even from out here. You guys ready to go in? Lead the way. It wont open. Are you sure you have the right key? The key's not the problem, dear. I can turn the lock.. But the damn door wont budge. Maybe someone doesn't want us to go inside. It's probably just stuck, we haven't tried to open it in a long time. Damnit! Sorry guys. Maybe we could try a window. We're not here to hurt you. We're just here to help. Can you let us in? Please? You know, I may have something out in the car. Guys? I think were in. Here we have the living room. Like I said all of the painting, decor... it's all from the previous owner. Wow. These painting are amazing. So you have all this... Out here we've got the patio. There's a small guest house out back. I'm thinking I can set up the control center up there. So, here we have the kitchen area. Over to the side here we've got the dining room. Now, this is where some people say they've seen the woman. He comes from over there... in a white dress. Well, yeah. They see her come from over there and head in this direction. Yeah. Well, over here - upstairs... Now, this is where people hear the noises. I've actually heard 'em myself. What do they sound like? I dont' know. It's kind of like the house is groaning or something. Like the wood is kind of, I don't know, rubbing against itself or something. Kat, are you picking anything up? Everywhere. It's hard to make anything out, there's so much negative energy in here. It's almost blinding... I'm hearing a name... it's... Does the name Cy... Cyril... Cyrus! Does that name mean anything to you? Cyrus? It's like I hear that name being called over and over. Cyrus. Doesn't ring a bell... You know, I probably shouldn't leave Mimi sitting outside by herself for too long. You guys want to go upstairs? Lead the way. Okay. Up here - What was that? I just saw something move over there. Did you guys see that? I thought I saw something moving in here. Uh... Whatever it was, it's not here now. Over here, we have the master bedroom. And that's supposed to be the main hub of the activity, correct? Yeah. That seems to be the case. It's where they found the bodies. Lead the way. Oh god! Oh my god! Are you all right? What's going on, Kat? So strong... so much pain in here. Look at these readings. This is nuts... How do you explain that? I don't. I don't know, maybe it's on the fritz. Over here in the corner, we've got this strange guest bedroom. I don't know what the original owners used it for, but - Shh! Listen! What is it? Probably nothing. Let's get out of this room. Well, that's it for us, guys. We'll leave you to it. Do you think you can help us? If what we've seen so far is any indication, you've definitely got some paranormal activity occurring here. With a little luck we'll track down whatever's doing this and hopefully get them to leave this place alone. I sure hope so. Well, good luck. You guys be careful. Before you go - some of the people we interviewed reported seeing something like rope around the neck of the woman. Does that or hangings or anything like that have any significance to you? Hangings? I don't think so. Huh. Well, okay then. We'll check back in with you in the morning and let you know what we've found. You guys be careful. Don't worry. We will. So what do you guys think? There's definitely some crazy stuff going on in there. Yeah, I've checked the meter three times. Those readings I was getting were for real. Well, it looks like the sun's going to be setting soon and I think we've got our work cut out for us so let's get going. Okay, I think we're good to go here, guys. I've got a camera and microphone mounted in every room where they've reported activity. Living room... dining... kitchen... stairs... back yard. Upstairs we've got the master bedroom... as well as the guest bedroom and a few other areas in the house. Great. Here are your communicators. Once we cut power to the main house, you two can head out to explore and I'll be here in the guest house monitoring both of you at all times. If anything comes up... anything out of the ordinary happens, let me know immediately and I'll monitor the video and audio feeds for evidence. Great. Good work Franklin. Kat? You got everything you need? I'm good to go! All right! I think we're ready for lights out. So you guys ready to get started? Absolutely. Kat, why don't you and I split up? You can head into the dining room, I'll head over to the living room. Works for me. Franklin, use your resources and see if you can find any more information out about the history of this building. I'm on it. Great. Let's get to work. Great. Let's get to work. Let's see... Okay, we're in position. Got you loud and clear. All right. So here's how I'm thinking we'll do this... Let's see... You want to position yourself over there. Back up some. Over here? Yeah, to your left a little bit. Okay. Yeah. So if you'll stand over there by the curtain I'll kind of wander around for a second, try to talk to the ghosts or whatever. Then I'm going to see something over there. So, okay, grab the curtain. And kind of pull it up a little bit. Okay, so I'm going to wander around the room for a second I'm going to see something. When I chase off after it if you'll pan, like, follow me with the camera. And let go of the curtain. Off camera, obviously. Right. Oh yeah, that works really well. Yeah. Okay, so we'll do that... that'll take us right out into the dining room and we can just cut over there. Got it. All right. Cool. So, ready to shoot it? Uh. Actually let's wait until Kat's in position. Whoa, whoa! What are you doing? Don't ever turn the camera off. They should've told you that already. You're just supposed to shoot continuously, okay? Anything they don't want to use they can just cut out later. Okay. Sorry about that. Yeah, that's cool. All right. So, what do you think about that Kat, huh? She seems nice. Nice? Right. Nice. Okay guys, I'm in the dining room. Okay, sounds good. I'll let you know as soon as we're done. Sounds good. Wanna go ahead and do it? Yep. All right. Here we go. We're in the living room. One of the rooms in the house that's reported to have activity This is also one of the rooms where supposedly people have seen the woman in white. We haven't seen anything yet ourselves, but... I definitely feel like there's something going on in here. There's an unbelievable cold spot right here. Is there anyone here in this room? If so, could you give us some sort of sign? Just something to let us know you can hear us. We're not here to harm you, we just want to help. Is there any way that you could... Oh my god! Over there! Well, there's nothing here now, but I definitely just saw something come past here. Creepy. How'd that look? Yeah, that was awesome. All right. Sweet. I want anyone to know who might be listening to me that we're not here to harm you. We're only here to help. It's important that you understand that. I'm your friend, okay? You can talk to me. Can you communicate with me? Give me some sort of sign? Let me know you're here? It just got really cold in here. I know you're here. I can feel it. Can you communicate with me? Is there anything you want to say to me? Whoah... Let me know you're here. Uh guys? I think you're going to want to come check this out. Kat, did you happen to see or hear anything when you were in the drawing room? No, I don't think so. I experienced a cold spot and I felt... a presence, but that's all. Well listen to this. Can you communicate with me? Is there anything you want to say to me? Did you catch that? A noise or something? Here. Let me isolate it. Is there anything you want to say to me? What is it? I'll bump up the volume and loop it. Help us... Help us. Whoa. Yeah. Uh... Uh... good work. That's a good catch. Yeah. There's more. I did some research on the history of the house. Turn anything up? Oh yeah. Take a look at this... This is Cyrus Blackweather. He's the painter that used to own this place. Cyrus... That's the name I got, when we first came in here. That's right! Did you find out what happened to him? Oh yeah. Harold and Mimi were right, it was a murder suicide. Cyrus killed his whole family and then offed himself. Really? Yeah, but wait till you hear how he did it. Let me guess. He hung them. Bingo. His wife and two kids. Then he hung himself. Right out there in that master bedroom. Why'd he do it? No clue. Everyone that knew them was completely shocked. Apparently he just went crazy. Strange. That's not the half of it. Check this out. Jonah Jameson, the original owner of the house. Lived here from 1958, when it was built, until 1964 with his wife and two kids. They found all four of them hung in the master bedroom. You're kidding me. After that the house stood vacant until the early 70's when it was purchased by another family. Whoa... All dead. All by hanging. This time only a few years after they moved in. That can't be a coincidence. And neither can this. They were the last ones to live in the house before the artist moved in. So since this place was built, every single family that's lived here has died. All by hanging. That pretty much sums it up. Amazing. Good work, Franklin. So how does this change the investigation? It doesn't, other than confirming that we're dealing with a pretty powerful presence here. We'll have to proceed with extreme caution from here on out. Okay, well, based on what we've seen so far, I think the dining room is definitely one of the hubs of activity in the house. I agree. All right. So we'll continue our investigation there. Kat, you go back to the dining room and make another attempt at talking to the entity. Franklin, you monitor the audio and video feeds and let us know if anything else turns up. That's what I'm here for. Maybe we should go together? Just in case, it'd be better to have two eyewitnesses. Sure. Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. All right, so Kat and I will go back to the dining room and make another attempt at establishing some sort of communication. Let's do it! Did you and Franklin work that out ahead of time? That sound? You didn't do that? Uh uh, that was a complete surprise to me. Me too. Huh. Well, maybe he mentioned it and your forgot. Maybe. Okay, Franklin, we're back in the dining room. I got you - proceed when ready. So, how do you want to do this? All right. So I'm thinking you can take a minute, try to talk to the ghosts or whatever and then I'll see something over there. We can follow it and that'll take us directly into the living room. Does that work for you? Sure. So, yeah, just stay on us and when we follow the ghost out toward the living room, Got it. Okay. Here we go. We're back in the dining room the room where we experienced a strange voice previously. It seemed to be asking for help, so Kat is going to see if she can make some sort of contact with it. I'm back and I've brought a friend with me this time to help. We heard you speaking to me... asking for help. What can we do? We're here to help you. Whoa! You guys hear that? What was that? It sounded like it came from upstairs. Hello? Franklin, where are you right now? Right here in the control room. Hello? Is there somebody up there? There's nothing there. All right. Just take it again from after my intro. Okay. All right. I'm back and I brought a friend with me this time. To help. We heard you speak- What the fuck is that? Hello? Hey are you picking up those noises? Loud and clear. It kind of sounded like the ropes... Like they talked about. Right... She's right. It did kind of sound like that. Oh, really? Did it? So, what, are you gonna be helping us hunt ghosts now, or...? No, I.... You know what? You're new here, so I'm going to clue you in on something. All right? This is our sixth season - over a hundred episodes And in all that time, you know how many ghosts we've seen? No... I don't know. Zero, okay? Absolutely nothing. We've been to every supposedly haunted place in this entire part of the state none of us have ever seen a goddamned thing. So whatever that noise is, I can guarantee it's not a ghost hanging from a fucking rope, all right? All right. Now let's - You know what? Fuck it. It's an old house, they settle. All right. Let's just knock this out. Kat, you try to talk to the ghosts, I'll see something over there we'll rush out into the living room. If the noise happens again, just use it. Go ahead. Okay. I'm back, and I brought a friend with me this time. To help. We're here to help you. We heard you speaking to me, asking for help. Can you communicate with us? Let us know you're here? Is that you making that noise? If so, can you make it again? Let us know it's you? We need to know if you can hear us. If you could just do something. Give us some sort of- Whoa! Over there! - What is it? - In the living room! What the hell, man? Someone just pushed me! What? I swear someone just shoved me right into you. Are you sure? Yes! All right, there's gotta be somebody else in here. Hello? Hello? Hello? Holy shit! Right there! Hey! Hey son of a bitch! It's locked. You saw that, right? Yeah, I definitely saw something. What the hell? Guys - can you come back here? You're going to want to take a look at this. Did you catch what just happened right now? Could you just come up here, please? All right. We'll be up in just a second. Kat didn't follow us? I don't think so. Kat! Kat? You out there? She probably went back already. All right. Boy you picked a hell of a time for your first night on the job. You ain't shitting me! Kat's not in here? I thought she was with you. Kat? Kat! Come in! You're not gonna believe this... You said you felt someone push you down in the hallway? Well look at this. Here it comes. Did you catch that? Play it again. I'll slow it down. What the fuck is that? Holy shit. You guys realize what this means? I think we've actually got a real-life haunting here. It's beginning to look that way. I mean, we've got a real life fucking ghost on camera! This is huge! It's probably premature to say that it's a ghost, but... Are you kidding me? What else could that possibly be? I mean, you saw the footage, that thing pushed him to the ground! Guys? I just think it'd be wise not to jump to any conclusions, you know? We can't rule out the fact that someone could- - Hey guys! - What? There's Kat. Rewind that. Weird. Do you have a camera in there? Yeah, just a second. That's strange... That's the master bedroom. It's turned off? No, I'm still getting a signal... it's just not showing us anything, like there's something blocking the camera. Kat, are you there? Kat, if you're there come in. Kat, do you read me? Come in? Okay, we need to stop filming and go find Kat. Whoa. Just hold on a second. We'll go look for her right now. I think we need to just turn on the lights and go find her, Jared. There could be something seriously wrong here. Are you fucking kiddng me, man? The first time ever we actually have a chance to film something real and you just want to shut it down? Kat is missing! Her walkie-talkie is probably just dead. I'm sure she's fine. Look - we'll go search for her, you watch the video feeds and see if she turns up. We'll find her. It's not a big deal. Well hurry up and do it then. All right. Come on. You know what? You should lead me. How's this? All right. Here we go. So, we've just recently had a direct physical encounter with an entity, and now it appears that Kat has gone missing. She was last seen heading into the master bedroom which is the final room on our agenda for tonight. It's the one where all the hangings took place, and it's supposed to be the location with the most paranormal activity. We're on our way there now. I just hope that Kat's okay. - Door - Thanks. All right, we're here. I've got her flashlight. I got you. Any sign of Kat? Nothing so far. We need to see what's going on in the master bedroom. We'll check it out. See if you can figure out what's blocking my camera. Check. I'll keep you posted. Did you hear that? What? It sounded like Kat's walkie-talkie. Up there? Yeah. Kat? Kat, come in. I think I hear it. Kat? Hello? Kat? Jesus! Hello? Kat is that you? Hello? All right. Whoever's in there, we're coming in. Jesus. It's freezing. Do you feel that? The temperature just dropped like 30 degrees in here! Hello? All right, whoever it is, we're coming inside. Hello? Kat? Where's your camera located? It should be in the upper right hand corner if you're standing at the doorway. I see it. There's nothing blocking its view. What about Kat? Nothing. There's the door to that weird little room on the other side, though. Well, she didn't leave through the door she came in... All right. We'll check it out. Hey Kat! Kat? Hear that? You hear that, right? Yeah. Kat? Hello? Holy shit! You saw that right? Hello? Obviously we've got some pretty severe activity occuring here. Kat is currently missing. We came in the master bedroom to try to find her and someone or something just put all this stuff in our way. There was absolutely nothing here. I turned away for, like, one second and when I turned back. This is what we got. Is there some sort of presence in this room? If there's someone in here, can you please let yourself be known to us? You put all this stuff up here, right? Are you trying to communicate with us? Do you have some sort of message for us? Is there something you want to tell us? GET OUT! Go! Go! Go! Oh my god! Did you get that on camera? Oh yeah. I got it. Holy shit! That was nuts! Franklin! Man, you're not going to believe what just happened up here! Franklin! Franklin! We better get back down there. You know what? I should be narrating this. All right. Here we go. We're on our way back to the control room after a pretty severe encounter with something in the master bedroom. We were unable to locate Kat and now Franklin isn't answering his communicator. It's probably just some sort of electrical interference, but with the kind of stuff we've had going on here tonight, we need to be sure. You're right at the stairs. Here we go. Shit. Franklin! Franklin! Come in, man! You gotta be kidding me. So what now? Uh.... Yeah, I guess we should get some footage in here. Okay. We're back in the control room after experiencing something in the master bedroom. We were unable to locate Kat and now it appears that Franklin has gone missing as well. That's my entire team, gone. Other than my cameraman, I'm completely alone. - We don't know what's going on- - Jared! Franklin! Franklin! Come in! Where is that? Um... isn't that the fireplace in the living room? Franklin! Hello? What the hell? The power must've gone off... hold on... Here. Over here. Over here! Quick! While Franklin's still out there! The door won't open. I think I broke it! Franklin! Franklin! Come on! He's not here. Franklin! He couldn't have gotten far. Aw, man! Right there! Right there! Franklin! Franklin! What the hell? Franklin! Kat? Jared! We're getting closer. Kat! Up here! Kat! It's coming from in there. Hello? Hello? Hello? There's no one here. There! That was a woman in a white dress. Did you see that? Yeah, I saw it. Ah! What the hell is going on here? Help me! Did you hear that? That's Franklin. Franklin! Crap. Light's dying. Shit. Oh god! I can't see anything! What is that? Sorry, it's just me... hold on a second. I've got night vision on this camera. Okay. I can see now. What now, man? What are we gonna do? Aw shit! What're we gonna do? We need to get out of here. Franklin has the car keys. Shit! What is that? Is there something over there? Hello? Yeah, sorry. You're right. We have to do something whatever it is. Let's go back to the control room, maybe he left the keys in there. That's a good idea, let's do that. Okay, I can't see anything! I'll guide you. Just keep going the door's right there. Straight ahead of you. Okay. Almost there. Okay, where? Through the door and to the left. The stairs are right there on the left. Right here? To the left. Good. Straight down. Just keep going. All right. Here we go... Keep going. Good. Just a few more steps. You all right? Just keep going. You're almost there. I can't see anything in here. All right. Where am I? Turn to the right. Okay, okay. Two steps down, you'll be on the first floor. Just keep going. Almost there. All right. All right. Okay. We're going to go to the right now. Here? Down the hallway there. Where do I go? Door's right in front of you. What am I doing? Just keep going. Reach out. The door's right there. Okay, I got it. Once we're outside, turn to the left. Where am I? What do I have here? What is this? Just keep going. You're good. Just go straight. The stairs are right there. All right, all right. Good. Where? What am I doing? Reach out. The hand rail is right there. Okay. Good. Let's go up. Just try to go a little faster. We're getting close. We're getting closer. Just keep going. You're almost to the landing. You're going to turn to the left. It's just a tree! Keep going. All right. Which way? To the left. Right there. A few more steps. Right there in front of you. Good. Almost there. Door... Just reach out. You've got the camera, see if you can find them. Okay. They're not here. All right. We just have to go, then. Let's just go. We're out in the middle of nowhere. So we'll walk. We can't stay in here. Please. We can't stay here. Okay. Yeah, you're right. Let's get the hell out of here. Thought the door. Stairs right there to the left. A couple more steps to the landing. Then turn to the right. Okay. It's just the tree. Where to? Wrong way! Back the other way! Okay. Just keep going. A couple more steps. Jared! Kat? Kat! Is that you? Come in! Oh, come on, man! Let's just keep going. Straight ahead. This way? To the left. The door... To the right. Good. Right there. Here? Yeah.

Where the hell have you been? Shhh.... Where's Franklin? Kat! Kat! Where the hell are you going? Damnit! - Kat? - Jared! Oh come on! Shhh! He'll hear you! Jesus christ! Oh shit! The patio! Help! Franklin? Somebody help me! Franklin? Is that you? I'm coming for you buddy! Hold on! Aw, shit! All right you sons of bitches! Help me! I'm coming Franklin! Franklin? Franklin! I hear you, pal! I'm coming! I don't know what's going on here, or what's about to happen. I just hope this camera is picking up everything that I'm seeing. Maybe I'm just going nuts... I almost hope that's true. I'm completely alone now. Everyone else has disappeared. But I'm hearing Franklin's voice... ..at least it sounds like Franklin, calling for help. From in there. I don't know what's going to happen to me, but no matter what happens, you'll have this tape. This tape is important. All the other stuff we've done, all of our shows... they were faked. Everybody probably already knew that, but it's true. But not this. If this tape makes it out, no matter what the skeptics say, no matter how the network tries to spin it, this isn't a joke, it isn't scripted. It isn't part of the show... This is real, and it's really happening to me. I just.... I think it's important that people know that. So, I guess wish me luck. All right... Here I go... It just got freezing cold in here.
