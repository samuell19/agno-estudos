â™ª What is this thing â™ª â™ª Called love? â™ª â™ª This funny thing â™ª â™ª Called love â™ª â™ª Just who can solve â™ª â™ª Its mystery â™ª â™ª Why should it make â™ª â™ª A fool of me? â™ªâ™ª Einstein was then celebrating, uh, the 70th birthday anniversary, and there was a colloquium given for him. And he said, "God doesn't play dice with the universe." No. He-He just plays hide-and-seek. Learn to write screenplays, television scripts, plays andâ€’ Jesus, they're so full of it, you know? You-You can't teach writing. It's not something you can teach. You can only expose the students to good literature and hope it inspires them. The ones that can write can write when they come to my class; The others never learn. You lose patience if the student isn't Dostoyevsky or Joyce. - No, that isn't true. That's crazy. - Sure you do. But what makes it worth it is that every now and then you get a gifted pupil. There's this young girl in my class who wrote a fabulous short story called "Oral Sex in the Age of Deconstruction," and it's full of insights and romanticâ€’ There they are. I guarantee Jack is gonna want to take us for Chinese food again. I think Sally's getting a little tired of our pasta places. Hi. Is it supposed to rain? - Rain? No. God, Iâ€’ - Hi, Judy. Hi. How are you? Can I take your coat? I opened some cold white wine. Do you want some? - Was it okay on the highway? - No, they're doing something at 80th. - Jack, do you want someâ€’ - They're always doing something. - I'm sick of it. - You want some white wine? Every time I go up to your place, it's murder. So, uh, theâ€’ it's the Chinese restaurant, right? I can't talk you into the Italian restaurant? No, no, let's-let's do this. Listen, don't get crazy, you know? Now, before we go out to dinner, we want to tell you something. - I was just about to serve Jack. What? - Oh, yeah? - Well, do you want to? - No, no, go ahead. - What, what? - Somebody tell us. Jack and I are splitting up. - Oh, I see. It's just nothing serious, soâ€’ - What? Gabe, we discussed this for a long, long time, and we both think it's for the best. - Okay? - You are joking, of course? It is a joke. Do me a favor. Don't make a big deal out of it. Because we're both fine. - Are you serious? - No, we are. We're fine. We're fine. - Yeah, no, no. We bothâ€’ We discussed it. - It's mutual. - It's-It'sâ€’ - What do you mean? Hey, uh, let'sâ€’ I got a great idea. Let's go talk about this at dinner. - Yes. - This is gonna turn into a bad thing. - I'm not going out to dinner. - Since when has this been decided? What are we talking about here? Youâ€’ She's right. It's something we've discussed for a while now. Don't be worried. - Why? - There's no hostility. - Nobody's angry here. We're fine. - What is the reason? - Don't turn it into a tragedy. - It's none of our business. - Guys. Don't turn this into a tragedy. - I'm going to get a drink. 'Cause it's a very positive step for both of us. How can you get aâ€’ you know, break up? That's insane. You're Jack and Sally. You got two kids. Hey, our kids are grown up, for Christ's sake, you know? They're in college. And we don't want to bore you with the details. I can't get my mind around this. You guys get along so well. She's right. I mean, have you met other people? - What is the story here? - Gabe, Gabe, that isn't our business. - I'm fascinated by this. - I just feel sick. Hey, we didn't want to ruin anything, okay? We want to see what it's like to be, to be, you knowâ€’ - Apart for a while. Don't not support us. - To be apart, yeah. We've finally gotten the nerve to do this thing. This is total insanity. You'll be back together in one week. I justâ€’ She's gonna keep the place in Riverdale, and I'm looking for a place in town. - Oh, I just feel shattered! - Oh, come on, Judy. - I do! - Hey, come on. Let's eat, hmm? What do you mean, "Come on, let's eat"? "Come on"? I can't eat. - Well, don't get angry. - I'm not angry. - You are angry. - I'm not angry! I knew it. I told you. You march in here and announce you're-you're breaking up. You-You have two kids together! Why are you doing this? - Why are you doing this? - This is not our business. Why isn't it our business? They're our closest friends. Hey, you're looking for one little answer. There is no one traumatic event. You know that. People grow apart. It's a lot of little personal things. Now, stop it. - I don't want to hear this bullshit. - Judy! - What's she so upset for? - Judy, whatâ€’ - She cares about us. - I care about you too. Hey, hey, we're fine, okay? We want to do this. Judy. Judy? This is crazy. Listen, Judy, what are you taking this so personally for? - I'm upset, all right? Can't I be upset? - Yeah, but, you knowâ€’ Judy, I've discussed this with a therapist. Really. You have? You've never said a word! You said this was none of our business. What is happenâ€’ Well, we were all so close! Or I assumed we were. - She's upset. She's very upset. - Hey, hey, hey. Will you guys please not turn this into a wake? You know, what-what, whyâ€’ what is this such a personal thing for you? I don't know what to say. Let's just go out to dinner as planned and forget it. - Judy, come on! - I knew this would turn into a big thing. So, why were you so upset? I don't know. I really don't know. - It was a total shock? - Yeah, completely. You know, they-they-they were so casual about it. They didn't seem to be appropriately upset. Well, were you hurt because Sally never mentioned anything to you? Well, I think, you know, if I really look hard, you know, searching over the time when we were alone together, I think she may have made an occasional remark about, you know, just wondering what it would be like to be singleâ€’ Now, with all she knew, all she'd experienced, that kind of thing. But she never said anyâ€’ anything negative at all about Jack, you know. Listen, before we go on. Excuse me. Just tell us something about yourself, you know, so we know who you are. Okay, um, my name is Judy Roth. I'm married to Gabe. Mm, we've been married about ten years. Um, I work for an art magazine. We don't have any children. Um, I do have a daughter from a previous marriage. I was married when I was very young toâ€’ Excuse meâ€’ to an architect, and it just didn't work out. It was nobody's fault. Judy told us she did finally go out to dinner that night. She said she was tense and nervous, although the others seemed fine. After dinner, they walked home from the restaurant together. While she tried her best to participate, she found the atmosphere strained. All in all, she said, for her it was a very peculiar evening. It's amazing, isn't it? You know, you think you're so friendly with people, and so close, and then it turns out that you really have no idea what they're thinking. Do you ever hide things from me? Me? Wh-What kind of things? I don't know. Feelings. You know, longings, complaints. No. Do you? No. Sometimes, maybe. Really? Like what? I don't know. You know how you're always so critical. W-We've had this conversation. You know, you are definitely in a strange mood tonight. I'm fine. I'm sorry. So Jack never, never gave you an inkling, huh? That's so strange. You guys are so close. Actually, I do remember one incident he mentioned at his office. Jack, you have to trust me on this. This girl is to die. Her name is Shawn Grainger. She's built out to here. You will have the greatest time of your life. And for 200 bucks, believe me, it's a bargain. Hey, I'm not gonna sleep with a whore. What about AIDS? She's not a streetwalker. She's a high-class call girl, and she will do anything you want. And on top of it, she's got friends. Hey, I'm not gonna do that to my wife, all right? It's dangerous. Look, who was the guy who told me that your sex life wasn't so terrific, right? Oh, come on. At a two-martini lunch, I'll say, uh, anything. Shawn has got a mouth like velvet. Believe me, just like velâ€’ She was a former Miss Something or other. - Oh, she's gotâ€’ - Listen, what exactly did I say at lunch? You said that Sally was cold, and you would, uhâ€’ You were dying to fuck your aerobics trainer. I should never, ever drink at lunch. Look, I'll tell you what. I'm gonna write down the number, - and I advise you toâ€’ I advise you toâ€’ - What are you doing? Lookâ€’ - Hey, what are youâ€’ Get out of here! - Have I ever steered you wrong? - I've never steered you wrong. - Get out of here. All right, there it is. Use it. He called me. Um, I got the impression it was about a month or so after he got my number. Uh, he was very polite on the phone. A little tense. You know, I can always tell the ones who haven't had experience. He wanted me to meet him at the Americana Hotel. And when I got there, he was very polite, very gentlemanly, very nervous. He couldn't go through with the sex. He couldn't get it up. While I was there, he experienced some terrible pains in his chest. And, uh, I thought he was having a heart attack, but they passed. And that was the last you saw of him? No. He called me a couple months later. Um, I met him at the same hotel. This time he slept with me. And, um, then I started seeing him fairly regularly. Every two, three weeks. He said he'd seen a psychiatrist and worked out his problem. One time I couldn't make it, and I sent my girlfriend. And then he started seeing the both of us. You know, alternating. Uh, then neither one of us ever saw him again. So he never called her. At least he had the decency to throw the number away. Well, to the best of my knowledge. But, you know, Jack is not a hooker guy. Jack is very straitlaced. And Sally's cold in bed. Sally's coldâ€’ Well, that shouldn't come as a surprise. - She's very cerebral anyhow. - Am I cold in bed? No. Why would you say that? Of course not. But I am inhibited, right? I remember you said that yourself. Amazing. You can't forget that. We had one minor, little argument years ago about that, which you blew up into a major confrontation, and I can't get it offâ€’ Do you ever have the urge to sleep with a whore? - Me? No, definitely not. - No? - Yeah. Yeah, when I was in college, I did. - Yeah? You-You're in an odd mood tonight. I can see it. You know, I think Jack and Sally's breakup has definitely affected you. You thinkâ€’ You think we'd ever break up? What kind of question is that? I'm not planning it. Are you? - No. - Okay. But I don't know how I'm gonna feel ifâ€’ If you continue to not want to make me pregnant. Hey, are we gonna have to go through that conversation again? - You know, you have a daughterâ€’ - Yeah. - She's a wonderful girl. - I want another. I want another. - Why? What is so important? - Why? It's cruel to bring life into this terrible world, you know? It's notâ€’ Oh, don't glorify your refusal on philosophical grounds. You know, if you could see the angry look on your face when you say that. You wanna make love? Okay, but Iâ€’ You know, if we can get into it in some way. - I-I can't just do it on command. - We can get into it. - We can get into it. - Okay, so put your diaphragm on. Okay. Hey, you wouldâ€’ you would never tell me you were putting your diaphragm on and then not do it, right? What? What a thing to say! That's a terrible thing to say! My God! You really trust no one, do you? No wonder people accuse you of cynicism. Jesus! Okay, I'm sorry. I apologize. I'm tired. It's 1:00 in the morning. Well, we don't have to do it. - Are you still attracted to me? - Yes, I'm attracted to you. - Truly? Because we do it less and less. - Yes. Of course. Well, you know, our schedules are not exactly conducive toâ€’ Oh, that's just bullshit. You know, when we wanted to, we found time. Hey, come here. Come here. People's parties, in other people's bathrooms. - Wherever. - Sit and relax for a minute, will you? If you remember clearly, when we used to do that-that, that spontaneous sex, you, you were very, you knowâ€’ you never really liked it. You were always tense. You always heard people in the next room, eating or making noises in the dining room. Remember that? Now you remember it, you know, in a glorified way. - Are you ever attracted to other women? - Who? Like who? Well, like all those women that you have in your class, who are so talented and insightful. You know, I'm sure they totally worship you. Can I tell you that they don't want an old man, all right? I think an old man does better than an old woman. Well, then we're definitely stuck with one another. Now, come on. You're-You're reallyâ€’ Come on. Some time later, Sally had a dinner date with Paul, a colleague at work who had always liked her. - Hi, Sally. Come on in. - Hello. Thank you very much. Come into my rent-stabilized den. Can I take your coat? Oh, it's lovely. I, I love it. - Thank you. - Just, umâ€’ I thought we'd have a drink. And I was able to get some tickets to Don Giovanni. - Great. Great. - So, you all right? - Yes, yes, I, Iâ€’ - What would you like? Anything. Uh... white wine? White wine. Oooh. I hear the staging of this opera is not to be believed. Oh, really? How fabulous. - Oh, that's lovely. Oh! - Oh, hey, don't worry about it. - Excuse me. - Don't worry about it. I'll get it later. - Can I use the phone? - Yeah, sure. Uh, you all right? - Yes! Yes, I'm looking forward to it. - Uh, it's this way. - Through here? - A good friend of mine did the sets. - Oh. - Uh, you wantâ€’ It's me. You're living with her, aren't you? You've moved in together. Don't lie to me, Jack. You're living with someone. Because I know. Because I do. Yes, I heard. Don't give me that shit! It's been three fucking weeks! How did you meet someone so fast? Oh, bullshit! You had to have known her before. Bullshit! Don't give me that shit! Oh, you're in love? So fast? I don't fucking believe it! You were seeing whoever it is all along. Well, of-of course I expected things to happen. But not so fast! Are you that sure? No, I'm not. Oh, God, it's just fucking dishonest bullshit! Hi. You, uh, youâ€’ I'm fine. I am fine. Listen, if you're having some kind of personal thingâ€’ Really, I'm okay. I'm looking forward to tonight. What are we seeing? - Uh, Don Giovanni. - A Don Juan story. I can only think of it as Mozart. Fucking Don Juans. They should've cut his fucking dick off. Uh, can I, can I get you some more wine? Please. You know, we don'tâ€’ we don't have to go. No. No, no. I'm not gonna put my life on hold. I've been dying to see this opera. - Excuse me one second. - Sure. Hello. Me again. I know who she is. Bullshit! It's Gale. Of course it's Gale! She's been after you since she joined the firm. You two like that sports bullshit. Don't lie to me, Jack. Of course it's Gale! She's exactly what you like. She's got that dark look, and she's bright and all that fucking Princeton bullshit. No! No, no! I, I thought it was anâ€’ it was an experiment! I didn't think it was final. I didn't realize you were having an affair! Yeah? Well, that's bullshit! I don't buy a fucking word of it! What time do we have to be there? Listen, uh, I-I don't really think I can do this. I'm feeling upset. What are you upset about? Fucking men! A woman gets to be over a certain age, it becomes a different ball game! - Oh, no, no. Not really. - Don't defend your sex! It's true! You're great till you start to show your age. Then they want a newer model. Sally, Sally, Sally, you'reâ€’ You're a very attractive woman... for any age. Hmph! It was a terrible blow to my ego. You know, I thought he loved me, that we were experimenting, you know? What if you had met someone first? Tsk. Probably right. Probably would have done the same thing. I had fantasized about being single many times. You know, it's hard to keep a marriage going smoothly with all the frustration and baggage. I don't know. I don't know. Gale came to work in his office the year before, and I had met her several times. Look, what can I say? She's-She's cultivated, intelligent. It's what he likes. She'd been over to the house a few times. She loved my taste in everything. She even dressed like me a little. What can I say? She's me, but she's younger, you know? Hey, listen, your short story was absolutely fabulous. - Really? - Yeah, yeah. I was very, very impressed, I must say. And I thought it was probably the best thing that I read this term. - It was really wonderful. - Oh, that's great! Yeah. The insights were great, and I thought the prose was very graceful. And, you know, in general, I was, I was impressed. - Oh, God, I'm blushing, right? - Well, don't. You know, Iâ€’ My face gets all red. I may just cry. Umâ€’ Don't take it that, that badly. I meant it as a compliment. - Well, I know, butâ€’ - It was great. The insights were wonderful. It's just, your approbation means more to me than anybody's. I mean, you're the reason why I wanted to start writing. - Really? - Yeah. My family and I, we used to quote, you know, "The Grey Hat." - Oh, God. How do you remember that story? - Yeah. Where it goes, "Giving up his hopes, compromising one's dreams, is like putting on a grey hat." We used toâ€’ I loved that! I meanâ€’ You remember that. That's great. Listen to me. You can hear my heart beating. Ohâ€’ H-How'd you get the name Rain? Uh, my parents named me after, uh, Rilke. - Did they? - Yeah. That's my mother's favorite poet, and, um, so that's how I got it. Are you folks, you know, writers orâ€’ Oh, no. My dad's an investment banker, and my mom works at Lincoln Center. Uh-huh. Are you an only child? Why are you asking all these questions? Oh, I'm justâ€’ I'm just interested. You know, I was so impressed by the, by the story. I gave it to someone else to read, and she was also very, very impressed with it, so Iâ€’ - Oh, really? - Yeah. Are you from New York orâ€’ - Yeah, I'm from East End. East End Avenue. - Are these too many questions? No, it's fine. It's just the "only child" one. Yes, I was an only child. - You know. Yeah. - Mm-hmm. So how did you manage to write something so, so deep? I mean, I-Iâ€’ Have you had aâ€’ Have you been married and divorced? Or, Iâ€’ Is your whole family stormy and tempestuous orâ€’ What? I didn't know I was stormy and tempestuous. - The writing was veryâ€’ was very intense. - I don't know. Yeah. It's-It's just a trick, you know? It's like, um, when I was ten, one time I wrote this whole story on Paris, and I'd never even been there, you know? So it's, like, you don't have toâ€’ It's just a trick. You don't have to know orâ€’ Can you, can you just turn it out? I meanâ€’ There are a number of very, very good professors who are notorious for seducing their female pupils. This goes on, and, umâ€’ because it's a cinch. You know, they-they look up to them, and they're, you know, they're older men, and their students are flattered by the attention. It's not something that I've ever done. I'm not saying that I haven't had daydreams in class at times, because some of those women are very attractive and very interesting, but I've never, I've never acted on it, and I've, you know, I've never cheated on Judy, um, or any other relationship in my life, really, 'cause that, that has not been my style, um, toâ€’ But once, many years agoâ€’ One time, many years agoâ€’ I was, uh, living with this fabulous, interesting woman named Harriet Harmon. I'm ashamed to say this, but Harriet Harmon remainsâ€’ was the great love of my life. You know, it was a very passionate relationship. You know, I loved her very, very intensely, and, you know, sheâ€’ We just made love everywhere. She was, she was sexually carnivorous, you know? She-Sheâ€’ We did it in stalled elevators and in bushes and people's houses, at parties in the bathroom. And, I hate to tell you, in the back of cars, she'd-she'd put a coat on our laps and then suddenly grab my hand and stick it between her legs. I mean, she was really something, and sheâ€’ You know, she wasâ€’ she was highly, highly libidinous. You know what I mean? She used toâ€’ She wanted to make love with other women, and she used toâ€’ she got into dope for a while. She would break that thing you sniff when she'd have her orgasm. And, you know, I wasâ€’ For me, I was getting a real education. And I was, you know, fascinated. I was just absolutely nuts about her. And, um, you know, ultimately she wound up in an institution. I mean, it's not funny. It was a very sad thing. She was, you know, great but-but nuts. See, I've always had, um, this penchant for what I call kamikaze women, because theyâ€’ I call 'em kamikazes because they, you know, they crash their plane. They're self-destructive. But they crash it into you, and you die along with them. Now, soon as there's a challenge, as soon as there's very little chance of it working out, or no chance, or there's gonna be hurdles or obstacles, something clicks into my mind. Maybe that's because I'm a writer. But some dramatic or aesthetic component becomes right, and I go after that person. And there's a certain dramatic ambience thatâ€’ that's almost as if I'm inâ€’ I fall in love with the person, in love with the situation in some way. And, um, of course, it has not worked out well for me. It has not been great, and, umâ€’ Anyhow, a few weeks after Jack and Sally split, you know, he and I didn't speak much. And because I, you know, found him elusive at the time, and we spent much more time with Sally. And she was depressed, you know, and we'd try and cheer her up all the time. I would be scared to live by myself where you live. - It is scary. It's really scary. - Yeah, I can believe it. And there's been a series of burglaries. - The house next door to mine was robbed. - Really? - And nearby, the people were at home. - Excuse me. Really? - It's lucky for them I didn't wake up. - I would die. I-I'd never close my eyes at night if I had to. So do you want to get something to eat or what? Sure. Hey! - Sam. This is Sam. - Hi. How are you? - Gabe and Sally. - This is Judy. - Hi, Judy. - Well, look, I have to go. I'm sorry, butâ€’ - Oh, don't be silly. - No, I have an appointment. I really do. - Really? - No, don't be crazy! - Well, I have an appointment. - We're going to get something to eat. I just wanted you guysâ€’ Oh! Oh, God! - Some coincidence, huh? - Oh, whaâ€’ I didn't get your name before. - Sam. - Sam. Right. Okay, Sam. So-So you guys are just walking around down here? I mean, whatâ€’ - We just had lunch across the street. - What do you do, uh, Sam? - Aerobics. - She's great at it. - And I'm a trainer, and some nutrition. - Uh-huh. Uh-huh. - This isâ€’ - Hey, what are you guys doing later? You want to come and have dinner at the house? She's an unbelievable cook. - I am. - Oh, I don't think it's possible tonight. - It's totally vegetarian. - Well, we can't. We can't tonight. - You don't eat meat, do you? - No, no, I don't. She eats it a little. I used to eat red meat every day, and then I gave it up. Then I had some again recently, and I was totally bloated. Look, we can order out. There's a little Mexican place around the corner, if you don't like this vegetarian stuff. Oh, yeah! I flip over couscous! You feel like cookin'? Let's do it. Come on. Whatever you want. - We're gonna stay in, watch the Grammys. - I can't, you know, becauseâ€’ I'm not watching the Grammys. She watches all these dumb-ass shows. I have a bet with Jill over the best single! - I'm not watching the Grammys, okay? - My mother is in town. Yeah, his mother is gonna be in town for the rest of the week. Well, you know, maybe later. I've been meaning to call. - You know, I've thought about you guys. - I wanted to call you last week. While we're down here, I'd like to pick up some decaf. There's a great store! I need some ginseng! Okay. She is really something. She is so great. You know, she's got a degree in psychology. - She's really into this, this fitness. - You're fucking nuts. Hey, she is terrific. She's in this fitness thing. She's a nice girl. Her family's from Delaware. Her father's in police work. I can't get my mind around this. This is what you leave Sally for? - Hey, that's not yourâ€’ Be careful, man. - I'm shocked! I'm serious about her. But, you know, you're my friend. I love you. I mean, we've been friends for years. It's like your IQ is suddenly in remission. Oh, please. Please! - It's like a mini-stroke. - Don't give me some moralizing discourse. - You're not my rabbi. Quit it. - I just can't believe it. You know, you're married to this woman for years. You raised a family. You know, she's wonderful. Yeah? - So she's a ball-breaker sometimes, butâ€’ - She's a ball-breaker. Don't you give me that bullshit. I lived with her. You didn't. - You don't know her. - I don't know her, no. So tell me something terrible. It better be incriminating. There's nothing terrible to tell you, okay? I care about her. She's great. I don't want to hurt her. That's not what this is about. Then suddenly out of left field, you take up with a cocktail waitress. - And I'm supposed toâ€’ - She's not a cocktail waitress. - She's an educated girl. - I'm thinking of you and Sally. She's terrific. She's warm, and she's nice. I can relax around her. I can breathe. Sally was hyper. You know that. She's great, but she's cold, and she's-she's-she's difficult. - You're telling me that. - Her Radcliffe friends and all that crap about her interior decorator. Hey, you wanna know something? I was bored at the opera. - Shh. - I was bored at the opera. She would never go to a Giants game with me. We would never just sit around and relax. If I put an ashtray down in the wrong place in the houseâ€’ So suddenly youâ€’ It took you 15 years to understand this, right? Okay, so I should've done it a long time ago, but, you knowâ€’ I mean, there were kids, and we're all scared of being alone. Hey, listen, I love Sally, okay? Don't get me wrong. What's wrong with aerobics? What am I, a snob? - What's that got to do with aerobics? - So she's not Simone de Beauvoir. I want to enjoy the rest of my life, okay? I want somebody who digs her nails into my back and screams when I fuck her. - She's a fucking cocktail waitress. - Or at least moves. Hey, I said stop it. That's not your business, man. You don't know what goes on between two people. I'm tired of being corrected and criticized. That's all I ever did with Sally. I was always auditioning. And your mother is not in town, Gabe. She's in Florida. I really think no matter how hard we worked, the marriage wouldn't have lasted. How long were you and Judy married? Um... five years. Why did you split up? At the time, I thought I wanted out. I felt I had just run out of gas. But as I look back at it, I think it was really Judy who wanted out. Oh, so she left you? No. No, she'd neverâ€’ That's not her style. Don't let Judy fool you. She-She's what I call passive/aggressive. Everything is, "Poor me, give me a break." But she gets what she wants. I remember the day she met her current husband, Gabriel Roth. My husband's staying out here for the rest of the week with my daughter. But I have to take the train in tomorrow night. I have some business in town. Let me give you a lift. I'm gonna drive in tomorrow. No, don't be silly! - No, why should you go in on the train? - The train is fine, really. I was just gonna get something to eat. Would you like something? Me? No, no, no. I'll get you something. What do you want? I was just on my way. Just tell me what you want. No, I'll get you something. Pasta salad. You want anything to drink? - Just pasta salad? - Yeah. And I can easily get a cab from Penn Station. - No, don't be silly. - See what I mean? He winds up getting the food. He changes his schedule, drives her to her door. And all the time, it's, "No, no. I'll be okay. Don't help me." What my ex-husband doesn't say is that for the last two years of our marriage he was virtually impotent, when it came to me. Um, he was just raging because I didn't turn out to be what he thought I'dâ€’ He thought I'd be one thing. His mother, to be exact. And I couldn't take the fact that he was totally unromantic in every way. He was the kind of guy that gives you an appliance for your birthday. I-I never got her a Melior Coffeemaker for a birthday present. I got her a camera once and an enlarger, uh, for our anniversary. But she wanted it. She asked for it. What are you thinking about? I don't know. I was, I was just thinking about that manuscript you're reading. Oh, geez. It's just a terrible novel. - It's very autobiographical. - Well, what else am I gonna work on? - Should I be insulted? - Why should you be insulted? Your description of the way we metâ€’ that party in the Hamptons. "He spotted her from a distance, and Harriet leapt to mind. It was that simple. He was drawn to her instantly, because she reminded him of his only genuine passion. His sixth sense told him to move on it. But she wasn't Harriet. The minute he met her, the dream evaporated." - Yeah, right. So she wasn't crazy. - Oh, no, just boring. Oh, no. She's the best woman in the book. - That's why he marries her. - But he pays a price. This is just junk anyhow. I want to throw it away. No, you're wrong. Listen, it's full of vitality and wit. It's good. - You're prejudiced, 'cause you're my wife. - Your dull wife. I don't know why you ask for my opinion ever. You know? You don't care about it. - That's not true. - It is true. Mm-mmm. I happen to think it's a mediocre novel. Because you have no respect for my judgment. If somebody else came along and-and said that, you'd accept it totally. I would not. After a little time passed, Judy and Sally had lunch. Sally made a surprising announcement. I like being single. You do? I had the opposite impression. Well, that's all anticipatory anxiety. When you calm down, you realize it's not as bad as you fantasized. It's like pulling a bad tooth. All the festering wounds of your marriage, the disappointments, the resentments, they're gone in one clean yank, and you're free. - Boy! - You can't imagine. After years of accumulating problems and swallowing one's anger, to have the chance to begin again. Yeah, I-I can imagine. The clock ticks faster for a woman. You have to do it while you still have some allure left. The one advantage of being a little older - is you have a lot of experience. - Yeah. I have a much better shot at making things work out... if I meet someone. I've often thought that if Gabe and I met now, knowing all the things we know, we'd have a better relationship, no question. Would you still marry him? God, what a question! You know, for me, I justâ€’ the thought of breaking up is just so painful. You can't stay together out of fear, because then you know what you become? - What? - My mother and father. Well, Iâ€’ I've pictured myself free. I know you have. How do you know? Because you got so angry that night when Jack and I said we were splitting. I thought about it later. I realized we must have touched a nerve. - No. - Yes, it's like Hamlet and Oedipus. You were angry that night because I did what you really want to do. No, you're overdramatizing. Gabe and I are okay. Nobody has it perfect. I know. I know. Listen, when it's good, nothing's better. Hmm. Listen, so I think maybe I have a possibility for you. - Tell me. - Michael Gates? The one you said was attractive in your office? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. He's only been there a few months. I know he had a girlfriend, but now they've broken up. I do think he's attractive. He's-He's-He's charming. He's bright. The timing's perfect. What more could you want? I just think if you'd come up to the office now and meet him and see how you feelâ€’ If you think you're interested, we could all, I don't know, arrange something. We'll all go out together or something. Michael, this is my friend Sally. - I'm finding some back issues for her. - Hi, Sally. Sally's with the Landmarks Preservation Committee. Oh, Preservation Committee. Well, I'll tell you something. I don't believe in capital punishment, except for certain New York builders. It's not just New York, though. There's always just a blind passion for the new, the young. - Nice to meet you. - Oh. Hello. You two wait here, and I'll go and Xerox those copies. I'll be right with you. - Uh, fine. - Take your coat off. - Make yourself comfortable. - All right. Throw it anywhere. Sorry about the clutter. We're in the middle of putting together a full issue of German furniture styles in the '20s and '30s. - I hate that period. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I did my college thesis on Bauhaus architecture. - It was called "Function and Fascism." - Mm-hmm. This was years ago at Radcliffe, you know. I got so much flak on it. It was very unpopular. Not that it won't make a good magazine subject. Well, go on. Have a look at that chair. Do you remember that? - Yes, I, I truly dislike that chair. - Isn't it wonderful? - Okay, what about this one here? - I hated that chair. So, what do you think? Isn't he sweet? Well, yes. He seems nice. Yeah, I think he's sort of great-looking, don't you? - And he's single and not gay. - Oh, I'm telling you, he just broke up. I don't know him that well. You know, he-he's kind of quiet. But I like that about him. He's got a great sense of humor. And he's a very charming drunk, because it was somebody's birthday party up here, and he had quite a lot of whiskey, and he was quoting Yeats' poems and he was crying. - He was? He weeps? - Yes. But in the sweetest way. So, what do you think? Shall I get us all together? Oh, you don't have to. He already asked me to lunch. - He did? - Mm-hmm. Oh. It came up that we both took courses at Cambridge. Uh-huh. Well, he suggested we both have lunch next week, so, you knowâ€’ That would be great. I'd be the matchmaker. I, I took an instant liking for Sally. God, I was immediately attracted to her. She spoke her mind, she spoke her thoughts, which I really liked. And she's, she's very sexy, you know? Um, now look, remember, I wasn't looking for another relationship, because I'd just split up with Amy, and I'd sworn off gettin' involved. But with Sally, God, there was, there was something that just hooked in at once. So you were grateful to Judy for introducing you? Yes, I was, very. It's funny, you know, when Iâ€’ when I first got to know Judy, I had the vague impression that she was flirting with me, you know? And I thought she must be unhappily married, you know. But I met her husband, and they seemed fine. But that seems typical of Judy, you know? She's very giving, and she did me this big favor by introducing me to Sally. Your second story was every bit as interesting as your first. - I just thought it was wonderful. - Oh, great! - I was knocked out by it. - I'm thrilled. I'm so glad you like it. You're so encouraging to me, you know? I want you to know that. No, don't beâ€’ Oh, don't be silly. I'm just one opinion. - And I was impressed. - I know, but you're the opinion. I thought your line was great about, uh, "Life doesn't imitate art; It imitates bad television." - Because it is completely true. - Right. I can't tell you how much your opinion means to me, you know? - Oh, you knowâ€’ - Listen, you wanna go for a walk? - Or I meanâ€’ - A walk? - You're busy, right? - No, no, no, no, no. Wha-Whaâ€’ I just meant for a walk, like to discuss theâ€’ - You want to hear more about your story. - Yeah. Well, noâ€’ You know, it was great. I thought the way that you structured the storyâ€’ Because the tension built up so, so beautifully, and you released all the energy in the last paragraph. - I thought that was very sophisticated. - Oh, thanks. I spent five days searching for the perfect word to describe the husband, and that's when I came up with "appucious." "Appucious," yeah. I looked that up in the dictionary, but I couldn't find it. - Yeah, I know. I made it up. - Oh, really? - I thought it described it perfectly. - Oh, youâ€’ Tolstoy is a full meal. Uh, Turgenev, I would say, is a fabulous dessert. - That's how I'd characterize him. - And Dostoyevsky? Dostoyevsky is a full meal with, um, a vitamin pill and extra wheat germ. "I fall upon the thorns of life. I bleed." I used to think that was so romantic. Oh, to write, to fall in love and to experience real passion. Really? You-You think that passion could actually be sustained? Oh, I don't know. Time magazine, they said you lose your sexual attraction for the other person in four years, I think it was. Well, you knowâ€’ - And Time must know, right? - Yeah. I sometimes think of living in Paris, you know, or Europe in general. I just find that very romantic, you know? 'Cause I like cafÃ© life. I would like to write, get maybe a small flat or something. That sounds great. Yeah, well, just walking the streets is fun in Paris. Listen, let me tell you. Until you've been kissed on one of those rainy Parisian afternoons, you've never been kissed. - I promise you. - And were you kissed in the rain? Well, I-I wasn't kissed, but I was the kisser. Okay, I was wondering if I could read your novel. How'd you know I had a novel? Um, you mentioned it at lunch, when we had lunch that time. Ah. You know, it'sâ€’ I'm very disenchanted with it. I'm reallyâ€’ Yes. I know. And I'm only asking you because I think I could learn a lot from it, and I just would like to know what you like and what you don't like and why you're so critical of it, you know? - Let me think about it. - Whoo! - Are you okay? - Yes. Well, let me think about it. I-I'll think about it, you know, andâ€’ - Oh, I shouldn't have asked you. - No, no, no, no, no. - L-L-Let me think about it. - Okay. Oh, Gabe. He's always picked the wrong women. Except for Judy. She's the firstâ€’ you know, she's the first sane woman he ever fell for. He's always attracted to the crazies, the nutcases, for some reason. I got a couple of theories about it. One is that, deep down somewhere, he knows it's not gonna work. So he suffers, and that, that kind of atones for some sort of early-on guilt he's got. Over what, I don't know. Another is, like, you know, all of us, he grew up on movies and novels where doomed love was romantic. Well, what about you? How are things going with Sam? Great. Absolutely great. You know, Saturday, we got up. We had a run down by the river. It was a beautiful day. The light was great, you know? It was just terrific. I'm down to a good weight. She's got me exercising. It feels, feels incredible to get in shape. I eat great. That's the other thing. You know, salads, no meat. Never touch meat. Later in the day, we rented aâ€’ some kind of a video, you know? It was some sort of dopey, funny, stupid little thing. Something Sally would have never let me bring in the house. I want to tell you something. I laughed like hell. I had a terrific time, and I didn't have to feel guilty about it. Like I said, she's not Simone de Beauvoir, okay? We argue sometimes. Trust me on this, will you? It's Lear. King Lear. Shakespeare never wrote about a King Leo. Well, Mr. Intellectual, Shakespeare wrote in English, not Japanese. That's wonderful. Mm, I was just gonna make some cappuccino or something. You want some? - Nope. - You're sure? I'm positive. Absolutely. Mm. Listen, don't start getting all excited. I don't have my diaphragm in. Tonight I want to make love to you without your diaphragm. What are you talking about? I'm serious. I was thinking about it, and I, you know, I thought maybe, you know, maybe I've been resisting having a child too strenuously. What? What are youâ€’ Since when? I don't know. I don't know. I just was, uhâ€’ These are just some thoughts that I've had, that's all. I thought maybe, you know, maybe it would be helpful in some way. What kind of help were youâ€’ did you have in mind? - I don't know. - Are you unhappy in our marriage? You know, Iâ€’ to tell you the truth, I don't think about it that much. Which is probably a good sign. You know, it's late. It'sâ€’ I'm tired. Do you really want to talk about this now? All I said was I thought it was a good idea to have a baby. I don't think it's such a good idea. Why? Why not all of a sudden? Because I think that we have some straightening out to do before we have a baby. You wanted to have a baby. Why are you in such a bad mood? Do you want somebody new? No! Who? Like who? I mean, do you? Certainly not a baby. Okay, so forget it. I was bringing it up because I thought you wantedâ€’ - Okay, fine. - Are youâ€’ You're in a bad mood, or something you want to say to me and you're not saying. We should be careful. We don't want to get into one of those things you can't get out of. So you don't want to have a baby, right? I mean, that's what I shouldâ€’ You know I do. Okay, so then we have to work on it. But not tonight. Tonight, any thought of sex is now, you knowâ€’ I'm sorry. It's not your fault. You know, this is crazy. I'm begging you to have a baby that I don't even want. - I knew you didn't want it. - I don't mean it that way. I mean it differently. You know, it's late, and I'm, I'm confused. You know, we have a perfectly fine marriage. I don't know what all this talk is suddenly about. Excuse me, Michael? I brought you a wonton soup. - Since you were too busy to come to lunch. - Oh, thanks, Judy. You're a sweetheart. Thank you. You're going to Carnegie Hall, I see. Yes, I'm going to see Mahler. Mahler's Ninth. Really? Oh. - Jesus, I hope Sally likes Mahler. - Of course she'll like it. God, it's my favorite of all of his. - Let me give you some napkins. - Thanks, Judy. I've got this great place to bring her to after the concert lets out. A little supper joint run by an Italian family. It's very intimate. Got a courtyard, trellis, little fairy lights. - Sounds beautiful. - Yeah, it is, it is. It's funny, you know, seein' someone who, you know, who's just left a long marriage. I bet it's been a while since she was courted, romanced, so to speak, you know? Yes. I'm sure. I'm such a square, Judy. You know that? I'm so old-fashioned. I eat all that stuff up, you know? Music, intimate restaurants, candlelight joints and stuff. I'm from a different era, I think. Amy used to say I should've been born in the 1800s. I think she found it all a bit corny. Oh, no, it's not at all corny. It's very sweet. Ah, but it's great, isn't it? I mean, you go in for that stuff too, don't you? - Oh, sure. - Yeah. - Oh. - Wellâ€’ Tonight was fun, Sally, eh? - Yes, it was good. It was good. Yes. - That music was fantastic. I usually hate Mahler, but it was good. The last movement was too long. I think he should've cut it down. The second movement was good. Well, you know, it began well. - Yeah, it started a little bitâ€’ - It gets sentimental, don't you think? - Yeah, butâ€’ - The conductor fought his way out. Oh, dinner was wonderful. Although I should teach the chef how to make an Alfredo sauce. - It didn't quite make it. - Oh, I'm sorry you didn't like it. - You want a... coffee? - Yeah. I mean, is it okay? I'd love to. Oh, no, I'm only yawning because I'm hyper-oxygenating because the car ride just made me a little bit sick. I'm sorry, Sally. I know I'm not the greatest driver in the world. No, your driving was fine, for the most part. It's not your fault. I shouldn't have had that last margarita. Three's my limit. I couldn't even finish the second. Ah, this is, this is lovely. It's very homely. English pine. That's myâ€’ That's the finest. I prefer French. My decorator screwed me. Anyhow, it's too big for one person. I have to get a place in town. It's funny how your whole life changes. - I'm scared here alone, you know? - Oh, it must be terrible. - There's been robberies. - Yeah, I bet. Uh, do you want to get married again straight away, Sally, or do you like being single? I love being single. Because, you know, I think certain personalities just need to be married. - I disagree. - Well, that's what they say. Not me. I thought I did. I do. I do. I think it's time for me. Uh-huh. So why have you never gotten married? Oh, I don't know. I'veâ€’ I got close, uh, in my 20s once, but it didn't work out. - Is-Is wine okay? - Oh, lovely. Thank you. I want to be alone, for a while at least. I want to have a few experiences. Then if it happens, great. If not, that's just fine. Well, I'm-I'm sure you'll get what you want. You're a veryâ€’ You're a very beautiful woman. Oh, thank you. - I can't. I can't go so fast. - I'm sorry. It's just, you know, - metabolically, it's not my rhythm. - I understand. Thank you. I haven't been in a social, social situation, you know, that's meant anything to me in-in-in a very long time. Well, thank you, Sally. I'm really glad to know you care. Well, I would not be here with you if I wasn't at least interested in exploring it, you know? Well, cheers. - Cheers. - Uh, tonight's meant a lot to me, Sally. - Thank you. - Lovely. That's nice. - Okay, okay. - What's the rush? I'm sorry. I apologize. I'm justâ€’ I'm overanxious because I like you a lot. Oh, dear. Michael, what can I say? I haven't made love, you know, in aâ€’ such a long time. - Mm-hmm. - My marriage, I told you, was, was dead. - Sure. - For years. I don't know why. Oh, yes, I do. It's the second law of thermodynamics. Sooner or later, everything turns to shit. That's my phrasing, not the Encyclopaedia Britannica. That is strange, too, because often one doesn't even see it happening. I did. That's the part that kills me. I was in town working. Jack was supposed to be out of town on business, in Chicago. All of a sudden, by sheer accidentâ€’ - Hi. Hey. - Hi. Hey, how was Chicago? It's, uhâ€’ It was good. I mean, it was, well, busy. It was busy. I mean, uh, he, the old guy doesn't want to settle. He's a tough old bird, boy. I couldn't bring it up. I was so hurt. And so full of rage. And scared. For weeks, you know, I waited for him to say he'd met someone, but he never did. Although I was always suspicious, I never found another incident. So I chose to overlook it, and I hoped it would go away. But it didn't because I began thinking. of getting rid of him and being single. And things just got worse between us. We put up bigger and bigger fronts. Now I'm single and I realize I'm one of those people who needs to be married. - Hey. Hey, come here. - Oh, hi. - Where are you going? - I'm just going home. - Come on. I'll give you a lift. - Oh, great. Come on. - I have a surprise for you. - What? I don't know if you'll think it's such a surprise. - I'm gonna let you read my novel. - Oh, great! Oh, that's great. Thanks. Now, you have to really go easy on it becauseâ€’ you know. Oh, of course. - So you wanna come up? - Now? Come on. Yeah, meet my parents. They're so in love with you. - Don't you wanna see how I live? - Wellâ€’ Richard, what are you doing here? So this is why I don't see you anymore, huh? What are you talking about? That'sâ€’ You're mistaken. I'm mistaken. I just wanted to see what he looked like. No. You're not what I thought you'd look like. - Yeah, becaâ€’ this isn't even my boyfriend. - Oh, really? - Yeah, he's my professor. Yes. - Your professor? - This is your professor. - I'm professor Gabriel Roth. Ah, nice to meet you. Yeah. Columbia? Columbia? Oh, stop. - Yeah. How interested are you? - Barnard. Excuse me. I wanna ask you, Professor. Do you seduce all your students? - Stop it. - I don't know what this is about. - I was just taking her upstairs toâ€’ - I see. Just go, please. I don't even know why you're here. - What are you doing here? - Because you led me on! I did not lead you on! I told you from day one I didn't want to marry. When you have her in your arms, what does she say to you? Oh, stop it! - I don't know what to say. - Why are you acting childish? - I ought to take you apart. - That's ridiculous. - You're acting like a 15-yearâ€’ - I'm sorry, okay? - You're sorry? - Yeah, we were never meant to be. What do you think I am? I just know you're going through one of your phases. - Why don't you just go in? - I am. What, I'm trying to help you out here. - All right. Fine. I'm sorry. - I'm getting cold. I'm getting cold. This is my mother, and this is Professor Gabe Roth. It is such an immense pleasure to meet you. - That's my father. - Oh. - It is an honor, sir. - How do you do? - Now, what can we get you? - Me? Nothing. I'm justâ€’ I'm fine. Just a, you know, sedative, if you have one. Who was that character downstairs? - I'll tell you about it later. - Oh, it's just youâ€’ - It got so sunny all of a sudden. - We're tremendous fans of yours. We wish you'd still write those funny, shortâ€’ funny, sad stories you wrote. - Let me take your coat. - Oh, sure. So what were you gonna tell me about that guy downstairs? Who is this? Oh, God. I better start from the beginning then, if I'm going to tell you. Um, my father, he had this, this colleague. It was his business partner, and, umâ€’ This guy was your father's business partner? No, no. This is why I have to tell you way in the beginning. - It leads up to him. - Mm-hmm. Um, and thisâ€’ my father's business partnerâ€’ He'd come by the house fairly often, right? And one day he told me that he was in love with me, right? And I was very flattered, to say the least. He was, he was real bright and single. And we started having this affair. Naturally, we told nobody. So now I have this friend Jane. And her parents, they were divorced. And her father Jerry developed this mad crush over me, right? Um, and before long, I was seeing both these men. And instead of being happy, I was, I was just miserable. And I couldn't get my feelings straight. And so I went to an analyst. And... I tried for a few months to work things out. And then, one day, my analyst said thatâ€’ that he was gonna stop treating me because he felt it wasn't the thing to do since he was falling in love with me. I was taken with him. I mean, you can imagine. He's, he's quite brilliant. And I started seeing him. And I did. I broke off from the other two. But something inside me told me that he couldn't be a very stable person, I mean, let alone a good analyst. So, I never really let things get too far with him. Um, then one night I met Carl, and he was very sweet and he really came on with me. And I came to my senses, and I said to myself, "What am I doing with these older men, "you know? So I, I cleaned up my act. And I've been dating Carl. But, as you can see, Richard is so unstable. He really took it badly. My God. You've got material for your first novel, and the sequel and, and an opera by Puccini here. - This is incredible. - Yes, but don't you think I'm right? I mean, Carlâ€’ he's fun. And what the hell am I doing with the mid-life crisis set? I mean, they're all, they're all wonderful, rather accomplished men. But, in the end, I just felt like I was some kind of symbol of lost youth or unfulfilled dreams. Or am I being too dramatic? Gabe. Gabe, now Rain's birthday party's coming up soon, and we'd love you to come. Gee, I don't know if it'd be possible or not. - He doesn't want to come to my party. - Oh, come. Please. Please. We would love you to come for a drink. You and your wife, huh? Mom, he isn't. He's not gonna come to my birthday. You know, I think you've been a wonderful influence on Rainâ€’ almost inspirational. Well, she's great. I'd consider it an honor if you'd come for a birthday drink. Just as Gabe gave his manuscript to Rain, Judy also presented some of her writing. Listen, um, I finally got around to reading these lovely poems. Oh. Youâ€’ Oh, you can be completely honest. Iâ€’ - I am. - You know, i-it's just a hobby. Iâ€’ I was amazed. They are so full of feeling. - Really? - Honestly. What does your husband say? - Oh, no. I'd never show them to him. - What? He'd be much too critical. You know, he has very high standards. - He'd be right too. - Come on. No, no. Listen. The two of you wrote about, uh, new England. Oh! There's a little graveyard on Martha's Vineyard where I'd love to be buried. I know it, I know it. I used to say to Amy that's the place I'd choose too. - Do you want to have lunch outside today? - It's so nice. Sure, I'd love to. - Gosh, are you soaked? - No, I'm not so bad. - What about you? - Oh, I think just my coat. Your hair's wet. - Is it? - Thank you, Annie. Thank you. Oh. That was fun, wasn't it? Yes. My hair's a mess. Listen, umâ€’ Judy, can I speak frank with you? - Sure. - Thank you for introducing me to Sally. Oh. Oh, yeah. - I think I'm in love with her. - Gee, that was quick. I mean, not that she shares my feelings or if she ever will, you know? - Well, she hasn't been single that long. - Yeah, yeah. I realize that, but it's, like, I've finally met someone I care about, and I keep waiting for the other shoe to fall. Well, you, you probably hadâ€’ you know, you're just a little gun-shy from, maybe, some bad experiences. Yeah. Is she as terrific as she seems? She is. She is. She's wonderful. She's honest and decent, and I, I can't say enough good things about her. Oh, thank you, Judy. I'veâ€’ You know how much I respect your opinion. Listen, do you mind if I just, umâ€’ I'm just feeling a little funny. It's probably that run down the block, you know? - I think there's some in the drawer. - I'm fine. I-I don't know why I introduced Sally to Michael. Why did I push them together like that when, uhâ€’ You know, when obviously I had feelings for him myself? So, you know, I was just very confused. I didn't know what I wanted. You look good. You don't get any older. You have to work out, huh? You know, since Sally and I broke up, I'm single. - I gottaâ€’ gotta watch it, you know? - I saw Sally the other night. She's dating some guy. She introduced us. Seemed nice. Nice looking. Claire could tell you. Yeah, I think thatâ€’ What was he? He's an editor. - Hmm. - Ah. - Hmm. - So, so, I mean, so what's the deal? I mean, are theyâ€’ I mean, isâ€’ Are they seeing one another, or what'sâ€’ No, I don'tâ€’ We don't know. I'm drunk so don't hold me responsible, but, Jack, you gave up a great one when you gave up Sally. - Ken? Ken? - Yeah, yeah. - He's just having a good time tonight. - No, he's right. He's right, he's right. I know, I know. Look, we were together a lot of years. She's a great lady. I know. I mean, not to worry. She'll be all right. - This guy Michael something seemed fine. - Ken, let's go home. Don't tell me I'm out of line. You're okay, right? That blonde girl Samantha, Sam. She should be in the Olympics. Hey, what do you think? I mean, are they serious about each other? - No, we don't know. - Did she say she's serious? What did she say? Jack, we didn't talk but for a few minutes. We just had aâ€’ She looked great. Has she had face work? - Face work? - Ken, we have to go. - It was good to see you. Let's go home. - Hey, where is Sam? If astrology were true, twins would have the same fate. It is true. It is totally, totally, totally provable, you know? - From gypsies? - It is totally logical, right? Why wouldn't the position of the planets have an influence on our personalities? That's easy to refute. Do you know who believes this? My baby-sitter. They know there is more crime during a full moon, right? Well, who knows? Well, you know, it's like who? The universe knows this stuff. You are all so smart. But it's like you just don't get the fundamental basicsâ€’ I'd love to get you together with my baby-sitter. - I would love to meet her. - Hi, sweetheart. She's been with me two months. Her father's not around. We were solving the secrets of the universe. - My ex-wife was a believer. - You should listen to your wife. What can I tell you? I'm just making a point. Because, you know, the positions of the planetsâ€’ it's, likeâ€’ It is crucial to your life. I cannot stress this strongly enough, you know. - And your body andâ€’ - Yeah, but be logical. I'm totally logical. I would not put a Sagittarius with a Libra, right? Sam, we gotta go. Come on. Come on. - Butâ€’ - We're just getting started here. - We were having a perfectly nice time. - Come on. Come on. - It's early. - Come. We'll see you later. - Come on. Come on. - It was really nice meeting you. - I can't believe you did that. - Jesus Christ. If you don't know what you're talking about, why don't you try not talking? They don't know what they're talking about. What do you mean? You feel so goddamn obligated to make conversation all theâ€’ - How about listening? - I listen! That's a novel idea for you. Oh, you are soâ€’ you are so rude, Jack. - I can't believe you just did that to me. - Right, you're the expert. Embarrassing. That is the most embarrassingâ€’ Come on. Let's go. Let's get out of here before you make it any worse, for Christ's sake. This bullshit all the time about astrology. It's so stupid. I've told you. - There's nothing stupid about it. - It is. I'm so sick of listening to your crap about soy beans and Zen foods and the fuckin' Zodiac. - Leave me alone. No. - Hey, get in the car! - Who do you think you're talking to? - Hey, listen to me. You wanna embarrass me in front of my friends? They're trying to make an intellectual conversation, and you're jerking off about tofu and crystals or something. Believe me, they're just stupid. There's nothing intellectual about them! - Get in the car. - No, I'm not going. - Yes, you are. - Help! Help! Shut up, will you? Shut your mouth, will you? - What are you, crazy? - I want to embarrass you. You want to embarrass me? Are you coming with me or not? No! I hate you and your stupid fucking asshole, asshole, asshole friends! Get in the car. Get your ass in the car right now. - Where's my bag? - I don't know where it is. It doesn't matter where it is. Here. Get in the car. Goddamn, I must have been out of my mind. Crazy. You're totally crazy. - You're too drunk to drive. - Oh, bullshit. I'm not drunk. Just shut up and let's go, for Christ's sake. Stop. Jack! - Goddamn it. - Look what you've done now! Just let me out of here! Let me out of here! No. Hey. Come on. - Will you just stop thisâ€’ - I'm not stopâ€’ - Get in the car. - You maniac! - You trying to be cute? - No! - Get in the fucking car! - No, no, no! - Oh, I don't believe this. - No, no. Help! What am I doing? Get in the car, you infant! Get in the fucking car! Christ Almighty. Jesus. Why were you able to have an orgasm with Michael and not with your husband? I didn't. I was trying toâ€’ Trying very hard to go with itâ€’ but I was tense. - I came close. - What makes it so difficult for you? My mind just gets racing with thoughts. You'd laugh if I told you. I get so mentally hyperactive. Like what? I thought that I liked what Michael was doing to me, and it felt different from Jackâ€’ More gentle and more exciting. And I thought how different Michael was from Jack and how much deeper his vision of life was. And I thought... Michael was a hedgehog and Jack was a fox. And then I thought... Judy was a fox and Gabe was a hedgehog. And I thought about all the people I knew and which were hedgehogs and which were foxes. Al Simon, a friend, was a hedgehog. And his wife Jenny was a hedgehog. And Cindy Salkind was a fox. And Lou Patrino was a hedgehog. I had the impression that, at times, you weren't, you weren't quite into it. - Oh, no, no. - Mmm? I meanâ€’ You know, Iâ€’ I told you the problems I had with Jack, butâ€’ No. It was wonderful. Oh, God. I've hurt your feelings, right? I don't want you to get the wrong impression. I loved it. Me too. I used to get really excited when we first got married. Then, somewhere along the line, it slipped away. Hey. It's okay. What? That I'm not responsive? We had a really nice experience. Yes, but we had two separate, nice experiences. - O-Okay, but they were nice. - They were separate. I'm beginning to see why your husband got a bit crazy. - Very funny. - Oh, come on, Sally. - Are you hungry? - He said, trying to change the subject. Oh, stop it. What was that? - There's been a series of burglaries. - Have you got the alarm on? - No, no, no, no. - Well, call the police. - No, no, no. - Call the police. I'll take a look. - Who are you? - Who are you? Jack! My God! You changed the lock on my own goddamn house. - Who's this? Who's this? - This is my husband. It's none of your business. Please leave right now. - None of my business? - Are you all right? Am I all right? What the hellâ€’ Who are you? - Is he living here? What's the deal? - Don't get upset. Don't get upset? What's he doing, fucking in our bed? Hey, hey, listen. Let's not get ugly here. - This is my house. - I can talk to him. - Please, go upstairs. - Where's he going now, huh? - I'll just be up there. - Yes, I know. - Is he going to our bed? Is that the deal? - It's not our bed anymore. You need some black coffee. I'm gonna make it. Then just go. Wait a minute. Sally, listen. I wanna come back. - Oh, tsk! You're drunk. - Oh, please. Oh, man, my life is such a fuckin' mess. Jack, this is not the time and place to discuss this. - Please go. - This is not the place? This is my house! - Hey, this is my fuckin' house! - No, it's my fucking house. My house now. - I wanna start over. - No. That's not possible. - Too much has happened. - Oh, God. I made so manyâ€’ - Sally, can I help? - Please. Hey, would you get lost? What is it with him? Do you mind? What is he, the guardian here or something? This is ridiculous! - I can handle this. - Oh, man. I don't believe this. I don't believe it. Well, you don't have to believe it. Go. Youâ€’ Listen. Iâ€’ My God. Iâ€’ Lookit. This was not all my fault, you know? Okay? It takes two of us. Both of us screwed up. I never said it was your fault. You don't know how hard you are to live with. Oh, please. Have I heard this before somewhere? That's it. Perfect. See? She's got an answer to everything. Everything. What do you want me to say? Our marriage was full of problems. Yes, I know that. You know, some were my fault, some were yours. But you lied to me. - Go ahead. Hey. - You deceived me. You cheated on me. Why don't you just run upstairs and tell him there's a stranger in the house. - He knows. He knows! - He knows. Swell. That's perfect too. Hey, you show me one couple that doesn't have problems, you know? It's not that unusual. Everybodyâ€’ It's tough. Everybody has a tough time, you know? What happened to the one you moved in with? That's bullshit. It's total bullshit. Well, I met someone I like. What? You what? I met someone I like. What about all theâ€’ What about all the years we had together? Well... you know, you had no problem wiping them out when it suited you. But Iâ€’ I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what else to do. - I didn't know what to do. - Oh, no, no! I can't discuss this now! Please! Go! You know, you'll feel better tomorrow. I'm gonna feel like shit tomorrow. That's what I'm gonna feel like. Oh, shit. Hi. Um, I need to... speak to Jack. How long are you just gonna leave me out there, right? I told you. I have never, never been treated like this in my life before! This is really perfect how you ruin a life. - Then go see a psychiatrist. - My life! God, I need to see a shrink, dating a slime bag! Oh, please! Hey, come on in. Come on in. Why don't you join us? This is about all of us, you know? - We don't have any secrets. - Bullshit. - We have nothing but secrets. - What do you mean? I never met a Scorpio who wasn't secretive. Will you stop with that shit? Scorpio shâ€’ I'm going to bed. Get out. Both of you, get out. What's the big deal? I mean, so I did a couple of things wrong. I yelled, I misbehaved. Does it have to be irreversible? The heart raged and demanded, grew melancholy and confused, and toward what end? To articulate what nitwit strategy? Procreation? It told him somethingâ€’ this business of how mind-boggling numbers of sperm competed for a single egg. It was not the other way around. Of course men would make love at any time and place with any number of women, including total strangers, while females were more selective. They were, in each case, catering to the demands of only one small egg, while each male had millions and millions of frantic sperm screaming wildly, "Let us out! Please, let us out now!" It was like those desperate ads in the personals column with a dozen requirements and, if they were not enough, there was added, "Must be a nonsmoker." Feldman longed to meet a woman who attracted him physically and had the following personality: a quick sense of humor equal to his, a love of sports equal to his, a love of classical music equal to his with a particular fondness for Bach and balmy climates. In short, he wanted himself, but as a pretty woman. Pepkin married and raised a family. He led a warm, domestic life, placid but dull. Knapp was a swinger. He eschewed nuptial ties and bedded five different women a week. Students, housewives, nurses, actresses, a doctor, a salesgirl. You name it, it held Knapp between its legs. Pepkin, from the calm of his fidelity, envied Knapp. Knapp, lonely beyond belief, envied Pepkin. What happened after the honeymoon was over? Did desire really grow with the years, or did familiarity cause partners to long for other lovers? Was the notion of ever-deepening romance a myth we had grown up on, along with simultaneous orgasm? The only time Rifkin and his wife experienced a simultaneous orgasm was when the judge handed them their divorce. Maybe, in the end, the idea was not to expect too much out of life. So, the book was wonderful. It wasâ€’ Oh, it was entertaining and imaginative and moving. You don't have to say this. You can be critical and honest. - Oh, I know, of course. - Really? All this suffering and how you make it so funny, you know? All the little lost souls running around. That's funny, you know, 'cause I've had so much trouble with this book. - I can't tell you. - Have you let anybody else read it? Oh, not exactly, you know. Uh, listen. I'm so thrilled that you feel this way. I can't tell you how encouraged I am. It means so much to me, really. Your feelings about it are reallyâ€’ I'm glad. You are a sucker for my work, so I shouldn't get excited. Oh, no. That's not true. I mean, I'm objective. I mean, yes, I do love the way you write and everything. I had some criticisms, but overall the thing was justâ€’ I'm sure you must have had criticisms, obviously. You know, what were they? N-Nothing serious. I mean, the whole thing was just a delight. - Ah, really? - Uh-huh. Yeah. I can't tell you. I've had such a love/hate relationship with this book. - Oh, no. Oh, my God. This can't be. - What's the matter? Oh, I think I left the, um, thing in the cab. You're kidding. - In a taxicab? Are you sure? - Oh, my God. I'm gonna cry. I can't believe I did this to you! - Okay, he was Indian. - You left it in an Indian's cab? No. He was Armenian. I can't believe this. That was the only copy. - I know. Wait. - You must be joking. Doâ€’ Couldâ€’ Was it Hargopian? Could that be possible? Hargopian? Yes. Mr. Hargopian? Or Swami Hargopian? Or what? I was totally crushed. I absâ€’ You know, I wanted to die. This was, you know, this was the worst thing that happened. But you put up a false front for her. Right. I had to 'cause the poor girl was wrecked. I mean, what was I gonna do? I was trying to bail her out. So this book was very meaningful to you, despite all your carrying on about how you hated it. - I guess so. - And the young woman? Rain? Her approbation was very significant to me. I mean, it was, uhâ€’ Well, why was her praise and encouragement for your work so pleasing? Judy, your own wife, had liked it very much, and you gave her such a hard time. I don't know, but there was some kind of rapport I felt here that I thought was, was meaningful to me. Hey! Hey! Somebody found your envelope! He's waitin' at the house now. Come here! It'sâ€’ It's so Freudian. What is? Uh, oh, the whole thing of leaving the novel in the cab and everything. No, don't be silly. You know, it could happen to anybody. - You misplaced it for a moment. - No. I think m-maybe it meant something. - Like what? - Well, I don't, I don't know. I think, maybe, I could have been threatened. - Threatened by my book? - Yeah. - That's absâ€’ - I mean, I'm very competitive by nature. - That's absurd. - Why, because I'm a young female? No, don'tâ€’ You know, don't get angry. Because I'm in your corner. You know, I'm, I'm your biggest fan. Yeah. I just think that, maybe, I could have been threatened by certain things in the book. Like what? You know, wh-whâ€’ Um, some of the attitudes towards women and your ideas on life. - You told me you love the book. - I do. I do love it. Yeah. - What were your criticisms? - Um, nothing. No, tell me. Tell me what your criticisms were. Uh, I was a little disappointed, I guess, with, uh, with some of your attitudes. Like what? What attitudes? With what? The way your people just casually have affairs like that. - That'sâ€’ - The book doesn't condone affairs. - I'm exaggerating for comic purposes. - Yeah. I mean, but are our choices really between chronic dissatisfaction and suburban drudgery? No, but, you know, that's how I'm deliberately distorting it. I'm trying to show how hard it is to be married. Well, you have to be careful not to trivialize with things like that. Well, Jesus, I hope I haven't. Well, the way your lead character views womenâ€’ It's so retrograde. It's so shallow, you know? What are you talkâ€’ You told meâ€’ You told me it was a great book. Yeah, it's wonderful. And I never said "great." I said it's brilliant and it's alive andâ€’ You know, that's not what I'mâ€’ We're not arguing about whether it's brilliant or not. I'mâ€’ You know, Triumph of the Will. It was a great movie, but you despise the ideas behind it. What are you saying now? You despise my ideas? No, I don't despise them. Iâ€’ That, that example wasâ€’ Okay, isn't it beneath you, as a mature thinker, I mean, to allow your lead character to waste so much of this emotional energy obsessing over this psychotic relationship with a woman that you fantasize as powerfully sexual and inspired when, in fact, she was pitifully sick? Look, let's stop this right now because I don't need a lecture on maturity or writing from a 20-year-old twit. You asked me if you could read my book. I said okay. You told me you loved it. And I do. Then you leave the fucking thing in a taxicab. And you're weeping, and I'm consoling you. And suddenly you turn on me. Okay. I must have hit a nerve with you. Well, yeah. Iâ€’ You knowâ€’ Boy, I'd hate to be your boyfriend. He must go through hell. Well, I'm worth it. - Did you have trouble finding the house? - None at all. I'm glad. Please, step this way. Thank you so much. You know, I can't tell you what this means to me. - This is so nice of you. - That's all right. You just found it in a cab? Yeah, I jumped in the cab, and I wound up sitting on it. I opened the door and there's this envelope. - Let me give you something. I wannaâ€’ - Oh, okay. No, no, no. - It's okay. - Really. I can'tâ€’ Please, I want you guys to stay for coffee. - You've been too sweet already. - I won't take no for an answer. - She won't take no for an answer. - She won't. Trust me. - Fine. We'll have coffee. - Good. Great. - A quick cup of coffee. - I'm sorry for everything that happened. - No, I'm sorry. It was my fault. - No, it was totally mine. Excuse me, Mr. Roth. If you don't mind my saying, you got a beautiful daughter yourself. Yes, I admit it. Her, herâ€’ You know, our, our argument in the cab was, umâ€’ I found attractive and it attracted me to her in some way. You know, that she was not just a, sort of a passive, little, worshipful pupil or something. You know, uh, something in me sensed that, uhâ€’ Not that I was gonna do anything about it. I certainly wasn't. Though... I had, you know, certain daydreams about it. Less than two weeks later, Jack and Sally got back together. This turn of events was celebrated over dinner with Judy and Gabe. Listen, you know, you can'tâ€’ You just can't wipe out years of closeness. I mean, you think you can. You don't see the roots, but, boy, they're there. I think some people are just not constituted to be single. Hey, look. Everybody screws up, you know? Nobody's perfect. The question is, do you learn from it? What do you do then? I think the true test of a relationship is how you weather it in a crisis. Yes? Yeah. Everybody looks great, you know, when everything's going smoothly. That's great. If you can be that mature, it's great. It's not that. It's justâ€’ I think youâ€’ You start finally thinking about priorities. It's a question of priorities. Yeah, I mean, how long can you discuss physical fitness and the Zodiac? Mmm. Hey, this Michael character was no bargain. Come on. Oh, my God. - How was Michael? - I don't know. He was sick. He called in sick. So I gave him a call, and he did sound very terrible. - But, I don't know. He had a cold. - Oh, dear. He's so sweet. I guess I really pulled the rug out from under him. Although, you know, his real crush is on Judy. - Oh, no. - Not to offend you, Gabe. I'm not. Iâ€’ You know, I love it when somebody thinks highly of Judy. Mmm. G-Gabe needs confirmation of his feelings. - Especially when it comes to me. - That's a terrible thing to say. - True. That's true. - No, no. No, butâ€’ No, really. - I'd watch it if I were you, Gabe. - Excuse me, please. He always talks about Judy in hushed tones. I think those poems you wrote impressed him. Hey, hey, hey, come on. Here's to a good marriage, huh? Mmm. Finally, the best two people can hope for. Absolutely. I didn't know you were fooling around with poetry. I didn't think you'd be interested. - Well, why not? - Because. I'll tell you something. I'd be embarrassed to show you my stuff. - Why? - Because you're so hard on everything. - I am not. What are you talking about? - You are too. - You're very, very judgmental. - I'm not judgmental. I like poetry. You know, I'm crazy about Shakespeare and Byron and T.S. Eliot. You knowâ€’ Uh, yeah, well. My stuff isn't quite that good yet. Well, I would have given you an objective evaluation. I don't want an objective evaluation, you know? I'd like something a little more supportive. A little more generous. You mean like from that character in your office? He's not a "character." - Are you in love with him? - No. Why, b-because I've shown a few poems? I saw Dr. Ritchie today. - Oh, where? - I went back into psychotherapy. Jesus, you're kidding! You don't need psychotherapy, and certainly not with her. You're just threatened by her because she's postmodern. Anyone who writes a paper suggesting the Sabine women had it coming to themâ€’ - That's not it. - Jesus. - I do not flirt! - Don't tell me you don't flirt, because I've seen you do it at parties. - You put on a whole other personality. - Oh, you're crazy! Of course you do. You get all soulful and pretend to want things you really can't stand. - Like what? What are you talking about? - Like moving to Europe. That's a flirting technique. You couldn't survive off the island of Manhattan for more than 48 hours. You're the one that misrepresented herself when we got married. - What do you mean? Like what? - Like what? Like you had one child and you didn't want any more. That was the way I felt then. People change. I'm not the same person I was all those years ago. - That's why relationships go sour. - Yeah, you hate change. - Sure I hateâ€’ Change equals death. - What kind of bullshit? It's death. Maybe you're fooling your 20-year-old students into thinking that's some kind of an insight or something, but it means nothing. Change is what life is made of. If you don't change, you don't grow. You just shrivel up! I don't want to make love. You always get sexual at the oddest times. What are you so tense for? You use sex to express every emotion except love. Yeah, you were attracted to me because, in some wayâ€’ And I never figured out howâ€’ but in some way, I reminded you of Harriet. But then I disappointed you because I was too normal. I was attracted to you because you were solid and decent and you were not crazy. - Yeah, and you found that too boring. - No. As it turns out, youâ€’ In your own quiet way, you're as crazy as Harriet was. - Oh, see? I did remind you of Harriet. - No, look. My sixth sense told meâ€’ Some kind of sixth sense said that you were not stable. But on the surface, you were. But now that we're having all kinds of problems, youâ€’ You're not stable. You were on the surface, but not really. This whole thing is becoming very clear to me. Uh, w-w-we both couldn't sleep one night, remember? And we found... the movie of Wild Strawberries on the cable station and we stayed up all night watching it? - Remember that? That was such a greatâ€’ - Yeah. For some reason, a great moment for me. Or when we were going to the faculty dinner andâ€’ I'll never forget this. We were on Fifth Avenue, and it was just an icy, black night. We were walking downtown. You remember that? - Suddenly we decided not to go to dinner. - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. We said the hell with it. It was such a beautiful night, We walked into Central Park. It was so snowy that night, and you could see every star. Mmm, remember how cold it was? You were so beautiful in that black dress. Really. - Mmm. - Don't do that. Wh-Why not? Because it's over, and we both know it. Do we? Yeah. You know, all that stuff thatâ€’ Those memories. They're just memories. They're, they're, they're from years gone by. They're just isolated moments, you know? They don't, they don't tell the whole, the whole story. Several days later, Gabe moved out of his apartment and into a hotel. No, I wasn't being completely honest with Gabe because I didn't want to hurt him. But, but I did know what I wanted. Um, I was in love with Michael, and I justâ€’ I wanted to be free to, um, pursue that and not have to, not have to lie or cheat or sneak around or anything. How could I be, you know, a hundred percent honest with Judy? Iâ€’ You know, I felt that I loved her. And Iâ€’ I didn't want to hurt her. So what am I gonna say? That I feel myself becoming infatuated with a 20-year-old girl? And that, you know, I see myself sleepwalking into a mess and I've learned nothing over the years? Then why didn't you stop yourself? There was something in my marriage that I craved that I was not getting. And Rainâ€’ You know, there was a certain excitement there for me. I don't know. - Rain had a boyfriend. - I know. Believe me, everything about it was wrong. I know. But, uh, you know, that did not deter me. That, if anything, made me, as usualâ€’ You know, th-there was something interesting. So what is it? You have a self-destructive streak? You know, I don't know. My heart does not know from logic. You know, it justâ€’ I'll get myself one of these. - Go ahead. - I'll get it. Hello? Oh, Michael, please. Look, Iâ€’ Weâ€’ I can't keep discussing this. I mean, it was a decision I felt I should make. No, I wanted to. I'm sorry. Look, I can't. I've said sorry many times now. I can't keep discussing this. No, I don't want to have a drink. I have to go. Well, you make it hard. I have to go. A week or two passed, and Judy helped Michael get over the loss of Sally. Here we go. - Oh, heavens, Judy. - Pretty good, huh? That's, that's mine. Where's yours? - I am so hungry. - Okay. - Here. - Thanks. - All right. Shall I be mum? Hey, cheers. - Cheers. - It's a real treat, Judy. - Oh, you're welcome. - Where's your wife? Did she come? - Uh, no, no. To tell you the truth, we're not together anymore. Oh, you writers! - Happy birthday! Hi, how you doing? - Hi! Did you meet Jessica? Her daughter and I used to be best friends. No, I met Angela, though. - Gee, did you see that? - What? Incredible this time of year. It's so beautiful! - Oh, I love storms. - It's great to look at it from up here. The television said we were supposed to get the tail end of that hurricane off Carolina. - Really? - It's really coming down heavy now. Oh, it's very fitting. I was born during a hurricane. I really was. - It's dangerous out there. - Wow. Wow! - She looks so lovely, doesn't she? - She's having a great time. My God. She's 21. You know, it's absolutely incredible. - Our little Rainer, hmm? - I'm gonna be 55. Well, you know, it's our 25th wedding anniversary in June. Don't worry. We got some light in here. I know I paid that bill. Take some of these candles out in the other room. - Actually, we'd better justâ€’ Can you guysâ€’ - Here we go, here we go. All right. I can't believe this. I know I have a flashlight. Oh, this is just my luck on my own birthday. It goes black. Hey, you look very, very pretty in the candlelight. Oh, God, did you see the lightning flashes? I'm completely drunk. - Mmm! - It's great. It's great. And the wind is supposed to get worse. I just don't know how everybody's gonna get home now. Happy birthday. I've been carrying this around all night. I didn't want to give it to you in the other room because I thought that, you know, it mightâ€’ people might think it was funny or something. It could be misconstrued, so I've been hiding it under my jacket forâ€’ Mmm, yeah, yeah. Oh, God, that's lovely. That is so pretty. - Happy birthday. - Why would it be misconstrued? I-I don'tâ€’ you know. 'Cause I-I-It would just look funny, I think, 'cause you have a boyfriend and I give you this very romantic music box. You know, I just didn't want anyone to get the wrong idea. No, it didn't look funny at all. It's beautiful. You know, umâ€’ You know what I'd really like? What? A nice, um, birthday kiss. - You want a birthday kiss? - Yeah. Birthday kiss. Happy birthday. - That's all? - I'm really drunk. This is not funny. I know. Mm. Soâ€’ What, why? What do you mean, "That's all"? That was a birthday kiss. What do you want me to do, bend you back and stick my tongue down your throat to your shoe tops? No. Come on. You know what I mean, don't you? I can't give you a birthday kiss. You're nuts. - You got a boyfriend in the other room. - I know. That's not serious. You know, it isn't serious. Listen. It's insane. I can't even have this conversation. Not that I haven't thought about it. - I have thought about it. I have. - Oh. But Iâ€’ You know, Iâ€’ It's just too crazy. Iâ€’ - That's so disappointing. - Mm. Why is it disappointing? You gotâ€’ You got a boyfriend. Because, it'sâ€’ You couldn't ask for a more romantic moment. I mean, it's my 21st birthday, and we're in the middle of a storm, and the lights are out and there's... the wind and rain sweeping the New York skyline. Oh, Jesus. Don't do this to me. Why do I hearâ€’ It's magical. $50,000 worth of psychotherapy dialing 911 now? Okay, I'm sorry. - I can't. I can't. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'mâ€’ - I've had a little too much to drink too. - Me too. - I had aâ€’ - Yeah. I'm justâ€’ So what do youâ€’ You want a kiss? I mean, you want a real kiss? - Yeah. - You want aâ€’ You want an actual, professional kiss, right? Yes. Both lips, upper and lower, simultaneously? Yeah, I reallyâ€’ been really thinking about it, I gotta tell you. Come here. All I could think of was I hoped that lightning can't come into a penthouse because I had never been in one before and it was tumultuous out there. It was crashing all around, and the scene just cried out dramatically to be played. I mean, she was adorable, I wanted to kiss her and, you know, it was pouring rain. But there was lightning bouncing around the terrace and I figured, any second, it's gonna come right through the glass or come right into the apartment, and, um, and that I would die. Judy, leave me be. I do not want to spend Sunday together, because I need some time alone! So be alone! I'm certainly not pushing you! Yes. Yes, you are, in that, that quiet, steady way of yours. You're always there for me. "Supportive" is your word. "Understanding." God, stop being so bloody-well understanding. - Thanks. - I'm sorry. I still think a lot about Sally. I still have feelings for herâ€’ feelings I don't think I could ever have for you. Oh, God! Where are you goâ€’ Oh, shit! Judy! Judy, I'm sorry. I'm really so sorry, darling. I never want to see you again! Okay? Don't say that. I need you. I need you. It's good to know how you really feel! But I don't feel that way. I was just upset. - You are so selfish and self-centered! - Please. I am. I know. - Nauseating! - Don't give up on me. I didn't mean those things. What did you say them for if you didn't mean them? Because I'm confused! I'm upset. Lord, I never want to hurt you again in my life. - It's just bullshit! - It's not bullshit. I don't deserve you. I'm sorry. Please. - Did you close all the windows? - Yeah, I was just thinking that. It's a good thing we fixed that leak in the den. We'd be swimmin' now. Geez. It's crazy, but after all these years, I'm still scared of thunder. Any loud noise. We would have been absolutely nuts to use those theater tickets, you know that? We would have been swerving all over the road. - It's a damn good thing we stayed home. - I'm glad we stayed home. Me too. You know, when we were separated, this is exactly the kind of night that would have terrified me. And I was scared enough sleeping alone. You know, sometimes you can be a lot more alone when you're with somebody. Uh-huh. Do you think we should have given those other tickets to Gabe or Judy? I mean, we did buy them for them. Yeah, I know, but the situation's completely different now. Right. A year and a half later, much had occurred. Judy was divorced and married to Michael. So, you happy? - Go on. - Yes, yes. Yes, I think things have gone pretty smoothly. - Michael puts up with my idiosyncrasies. - No, no, no. It's youâ€’ It's she that puts up with mine. Look, I told you. She's passive/aggressive. Somehow, she gets what she wants. She wanted me, she wanted Gabe, she wanted the job at the magazine, out of her marriages. She wants Michael. I disagree. No, when Sally went back to her husband, I made a big play for Judy. I mean, not at first, but, but... when I decided, I went after her. Yeah, gee, I hope I didn't push. Yeah, I-I wanted it to work, it's true. We're, you know, we're doin' fine. We really are. We're doin' good. We've learned to tolerate one another's problems more, I think. - Don't you? - Mmm. Andâ€’ well, I've learned, anyway, that, that love is, is, is not about passion and romance necessarily. It's, it's also about companionship and, umâ€’ You know, it's like a buffer against loneliness, I think. That stuff is really important. It reallyâ€’ You know, somebody to grow old with. I think the thing that's so tough that kills most people is just unreal expectations. Mm, absolutely. What about things that can't be talked about? Like sexual problems, for instance. - Well, that'sâ€’ - Unresolved. Unresolved? Well, there-there's some things you can't solve. And then you have to live with it. You construct some kind of patchwork thing and, um, it's, uhâ€’ - But sometimes they flare up. - They do, and when that happensâ€’ They do.They justâ€’ It kind of gets tough when that happens. You know, they're gonna do it. But you learn to deal with the problem and push it back down. It's not bad. And, you know, it works. That's the weird thing. It works okay. It's not bad. I mean, you can't force yourself to conform to some abstract vision of love or, or, you know, marriage. It's, umâ€’ Every situation's different. See, whatever works is the deal. I mean, everything is gonna be different. Ours is one way, somebody else's is another way. It's funny. You know what's funny? Last year when we were at Gabe and Judy's that night. And we announced so flippantly we were splitting. - Ridiculous. - I wasn't feeling that confident inside. I sure as hell wasn't either. Stupid. I remember envying them so, thinking they were so lucky. They had such a great marriage. Yeah, it's ironic that, you know, we're together and they aren't. - Yeah. - Weird. I experienced a very romantic moment with Rain at her 21st birthday party, and... I could feel... the old pull coming back. You know, the old attraction coming back and some feelings that I sensed from the past in my life. It was very vivid to me. That was a, that was a... a great moment there, but I don't really think that we should follow up on it. Oh, wh-what do you, what do you mean? Well, you know. I justâ€’ Myâ€’ If things were, you know, were differentâ€’ If I was younger or, you know, if you were older or anything different, but I justâ€’ Somehow I-I just feel I know how this is gonna come out. You sure? I am. I, you know, I really am. Okay. Okay. Um... mmm, I know how i-it would end. And... I left and I walked out into the pouring rain. You know, first I, you know, just headed instinctively back to my apartment 'cause, you know, I wanted to hold Judy and kiss her and say things to her. And, you know, and thenâ€’ Then I realized that, you know, I really blew it. So what's your life like now? Uh, you know, I'm, I'm out of the race at the moment. I-I-I don't want to get involved with anybody. I-I, um, I don't want to hurt anyone. I don't want to get hurt. I just, you know, I justâ€’ I don't mind... you know, living by myself and working. Iâ€’ You know, it's temporary. I mean, the feelings will pass. And then I'll have the urge to get back into the swing of things and, you know, that seems to be how it goes andâ€’ But, as I say, I'm, I'm writing. I'm working on a, uh, a novelâ€’ A new novel, not the old one anymore. And, um, you know, it's fine. Absolutely fine. - Is it different? Uhâ€’ - My novel? Yes, it's less, uh, less confessional, more, more political. Uhâ€’ Eh, eh, can I go? Is this over? â™ª What is this thing â™ª â™ª Called love? â™ª â™ª This funny thing â™ª â™ª Called love â™ª â™ª Just who can solve â™ª â™ª Its mystery? â™ª â™ª Why should it make â™ª â™ª A fool of me? â™ª â™ª I saw you there â™ª â™ª One wonderful day â™ª â™ª You took my heart â™ª â™ª And threw it away â™ª â™ª That's why I asked the Lord â™ª â™ª In heaven above â™ª â™ª What is this thing â™ª â™ª Called love? â™ªâ™ª
