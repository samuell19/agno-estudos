Hey, hey, how are you doing, gentlemen? Isn't it a great day to be alive? Hey, I betcha every day looks good to you, Roch, with all them beauties. Baking bread, no less. Oh, listen, my friend, you come down with a grader some day, you know, do a little road work, this and that. And I promise you, I'll give you a fair exchange. Ask Rod over there, he'll tell you. You know, he brings a load of gravel. I supply him labor for his fencing. I tell ya, bartering, eh? It's the way of the future. All good things, organic, very delicious, sir. Me, I bet you can charge double what I ask from you. You with that bunch living out in the bush by Church River. Yeah, yeah, oh, we're working very hard to make a paradise. You should come and visit sometime. There's nothing funny in the bread, is there? Funny? Yeah, you know, dope or something. Oh, my god, no, never. So sorry... sorry, I didn't mean... Ahem. Sure, hey, I'll take what you've got. And if they sell, we can work something out on a regular basis. Thank you, sir. Oh, thank you. So when did you bake these? At 3 o'clock this morning. There's two dozens here. 3 o'clock? Yeah, in the morning. That's when we wake up to make bread. OK. Two dozens, and it's $4 per dozen. And these bread here are $0.50 each. They're really, really good. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Morning, Paula, can I get you anything? Just a coffee today, thanks. One rooster to a hen house, ah. It's plenty. I've got a few chickens here and there myself. We put them in the same house together, I figure they'd peck me to death in no time. Yeah, right. Hey, blue eyes, blue eyes, smoking is very bad. You know, I used to run the clinic to help people quit. I had a big success rate. It's going to kill you. Well, we're all going to die one day. No, no, no, no, no, not me. I'm never going to die. I just want my kids back, OK. I know... I know I'm not good for much, but I can take care of my own fucking kids. This is crazy. Can I bum a smoke? Yeah. And Ginger, she's the sweetest baby ever. Hug me, mom, harder. Come on. Fuck off, you fuck off. Your children will be returned to you when you stop using drugs. But I did. I quit. I've been rehabbing, 12-stepping, fucked over a thousand times. Just give me a chance. It's not for you to say, Irene. A blood test once a week for six months. If you're clean, you get your kids back, simple. You know, I've to go. No, no! No, no, I'm not going without my kids! Give them back this minute! No! No, no! Let go of me. I'm not going. No, I'm not going without my kids. Let's go outside. Let me go! Run! Get out! Run! They'll take your kids! It's going to be OK. It's going to be OK. Suzette, Lise, my colleague Paula Jackson. Hi. Paula here is from Children's Aid. These are the last in a long line of women from the commune out at Church River to come in asking for assistance. I have explained again and again ad nauseum that Toronto has designated them an institution, and thus they are not eligible for welfare benefits. Is it because we're French? Good God, no, it's because you call yourselves a bloody church. Madame, winter is coming. Children need boots, warm clothes, food. How many kids are there out there now anyway? 17 children. We're nine women and two men. Well, two men besides Roch. We have a contingency fund for emergencies. But it's a one-time only proposition. We only get involved on an ongoing basis if you abuse your children. It's an upside down world all right. I'm sorry. Don't worry. God will provide. What? What? Hey, hey, hey, hey, welcome, my friends. Welcome, welcome to our humble domain. Say, Roch, I hope you think... Or you folks don't mind us barging in like this. We brought up some blankets and some canned goods, so, uh... We've got a few bags of clothing for the children, snowsuits, some mitts. You know, winter's coming, eh. All highly unofficially but, hey, wanted to help you out however we could. No, no, no, it's a pleasure. It's a pleasure. You know, we're not that foolish that we would look a gift horse in the mouth, even an English gift horse. You know, we were starting to think that maybe, you know, you people, you turned your back on us because we're ignorant French-Canadians. Oh, that's ridiculous. Why would you think such a thing? Where is the check? I'm just joking with you, Blue Eyes. Everybody knows money is shit. The best things in life are free. Oh, I want to show you the school room, nice school room. Come, come with me. Tomato, potato, tomatoes, potatoes. Voila. See, the schoolhouse is one of the first things we built. Hey, we may be savages who live in the bush, but education is very important to us. And here is Marie-Claude. Come, come, come. Marie-Claude has a very, very special gift for teaching children. She worked for a long time in a kindergarten in Quebec. And there is Alinne... She's my daughter from Marie-Claude. Will you show our guests into the house? - OK. - OK. Come. Well, let's eat. This looks fabulous, quite the feast. Thank you. You're welcome, my friend. Oh, this is my wife, Suzette. She's been all over the world. She's a professional nurse, invaluable to us. Please, please, my darlings, please, please, sit. Sit, my sweets, come, come. I want to introduce you properly. These are my concubines. What about Alphonse and Danny? Well, Danny is with Jeanette, and Alphonse over here, he's married to Marie-Claude. But, um, Jeanette and Marie-Claude are still your concubines? Well, yes, why not? You can't get too much love, eh? We came here to create a new world, to make it our own. We work hard, yes, but we work with our hands, and we create beautiful things. We love God and, of course, we love one another. It is a Garden of Eden, not at all an institution, eh. Marie, Marie, come see Papa. Come, come here. I want to show you my babies. Marie, Marc, Jacques. Jacques, go get my guitar. These are my babies. They are the love of my life, the eyes of my soul. Give me that, give me that. You have any children, Blue Eyes. No. You married? Not anymore. Oh, how long have you been divorced? Not long enough. Listen to this. I'm sure you never heard this one before. What are they trying to say? What is it? What does it mean? Guys going off to war. Uh, both of you are under arrest for attempted singing. It was really bad. Oh, look, we went out to the commune today doing all good works, and Terry will start singing that song. Come on, Paula, the guy's pretty good. I mean, at least he didn't start singing "Michael Row the Boat Ashore." He makes my skin crawl. Oh, she's full of shit. If half our clients was half as industrious, we'd have half the workload. I mean, maybe they've got the answer. Maybe they will make it a better world, huh? How come it gives you the creeps? I don't know. It's the whole set-up. It sort of reminds me of the Waltons. Yeah, that's... That's creepy, Paula. Look, the Waltons is TV. But I see something that plays like TV in real life, it's... It's... it's bullshit. Shut up, shut up, you, run. Paula? Paula? You OK? Yes, um, daydreaming. One of the babies out of the commune has died. What? I thought since you've already been out there, you might go out again, talk to the mother, see how she's doing. The coroner's done an autopsy already, crib death apparently. Lise, how are you? I heard about the baby. Who's the mother? I just want to see that she's all right. Uh, um, me, I don't know. You don't know who the mother is? I must ask Moses. Moses, what are you talking about? Who's Moses? Roch, Roch is Moses. Lise, I just want to talk to her. This way. Danielle, this is a worker from the government. She wants to talk with you. Me, I'll take care of it, OK. I'm so sorry, Danielle. What happened? Can you tell me what happened? It's all for the best, Madame. Guillaume is with God now. Yes, yes, of course, he is. It didn't seem so cold when we put him outside. You put Guillaume outside? He was crying and crying. And he would not stop, not even when Moses tell him to be quiet. We are mourning the death of our dear baby, Guillaume. It's not a good time for you to call. Take her to the house. Mourning his death by making his mother scrub the floor, hm? Sometimes work is the best medicine. You know, you have to look to the future and let the past go. You get the fuck off my land right now. I can repeat myself till I'm blue in the face, Mrs. Jackson, but my findings won't change. That baby died of SIDS, crib death. There's not a shred of doubt in my mind. Yes, but in light of what the mother told me, maybe you'll want to reconsider. Were there any signs of hypothermia, for instance, that you might have overlooked? Are you questioning my expertise? No, of course not. I was only... I have a lot ahead of me today, please. Good day. Pompous old fart. Crib death, yes, of course, that's what happens when you put a crib outside in freezing weather. That's hearsay. Well, it's hearsay from the horse's mouth, Gayle. What more do we need? We need a horse who would say it in court. God, I'm sorry to be such a nuisance. I was really afraid, you know, of Roch. Such malevolence. And the worst thing was, I knew in my bones that none of the others would help me, no matter what. The thing is you can't help them either, Paula, not until they want it. Excuse me. Hi, Gayle. Quebec police have a file on him a mile long. Roch Theriault, also known as Moses, lived in relative isolation in the Gaspe with a band of dedicated followers, nine women and two men, ranging in age from 25 to 34. Five of those women had born children while in Quebec. After one of the infants, a boy, had died of a beating, questions were raised about Roch's role in his death, and he served 18 months in jail for criminal negligence. After which, he was released on probation. At this time, he and his followers disappeared into thin air. Thin air, being Church River. He broke the conditions of his probation, Vern. Can we pick him up on that? Not a chance. Quebec's a different jurisdiction. They don't seem to be interested in him anymore. They're probably glad to get rid of him. But now that we have this information, surely we have the right Togo out there and investigate. Not without a complaint. Or evidence of some kind, a doctor or teacher, anyone who witnessed anything. Well, they don't see a doctor on this. They're dead apparently, and the teacher is part of the commune. But they have neighbors, huh, don't they? Hi, how are you? Pretty good. I'm Paula Jackson from Children's Aid. I'm just doing a little background check on the people over at the commune. Have you noticed anything peculiar, anything disturbing about the kids? Piss off, all right. So you want to know how things sit with me and those freaks, eh? Well, I'm particularly interested in the children, of course. Have you seen much of them? Do you have any thoughts about... Rod, that's my husband. He's something of a big shot around here. Only lumber mill worth its weight in gold for 100 miles, big shot, busy man. Of course, any free time, and he's hauling wood to the commune for free. Why would he do that then? I mean, haul lumber up there for free? For all the French pussy that's on offer. That's why, lady. And don't be thinking that my old man is the only bastard sniffing around up there. Roch's got them all coming and going. Anything he wants for services rendered. And the kids, anything? Kids, who needs 'em. Fought the first war, I want no income tax, no passports, nothing. A man could come and go as he pleases. Yes, he must have been wonderful. But do you have any thoughts about the people over at the commune? Ah, no government handouts for welfare bums. No government interference either. Eh, a man worked hard, by his wits, no how, looked after his own like God intended. Oh, you should quit with them, little lady. You should spend some time up in the commune. I had that ignorant habit for 52 years and Roch, he got me to quit, yes, sir. Yes, but do you have any insight into the goings on at the commune? You come up to the house when I'm done here, I'll show you. I got lots of reading material. I know who's behind this mess. It's the international and the multi-nationals, and the Jews with their banks. Senior men's hockey is coming to town, OK. I mean, this is big, lots of excitement. I mean, these guys had actually... they'd been something in their day. We're talking N-H-L, all right. Now Bruce and me'd been separated for what, like about... I don't know... two years at this point. I mean, I was so horny. I'd find myself fondling the cucumbers at Shop Easy, OK. So the game is a one-up kind of thing. And I say to myself, I am going to get me one of them big strapping hockey players, you know, the kind who knows a thing or two, you know what I mean, ladies. So I get myself all dolled up, right. I'm looking real good. I go to this stupid game. I get invited back to the bar and the party. And suddenly I'm getting down and serious... you know, not too serious. You don't want to scare them off... With Mr. Big, OK. The guy has shoulders out to here. His forearm is the size of my thigh. So he buys me a drink, buys me a fucking rose. So I take him home. The girls are at my sisters for the night. You know, you've got to plan these things. So we have another drink, start to dance, a little necking. The next thing you know, we're tearing each other's clothes off. We get buck naked. The guy's dick... I kid you not... His dick is this big. Anybody home? What did you do? What are you going to do? You don't laugh at a guy's dick, never. I fucked him and pretended it was the lay of a lifetime. And then I went back to the produce department. To big dicks. Ooh, yeah. So, Paula, you've been out to the commune. What's your guess? Roch got a big dick. I've seen it. - You devil. - No. Full of surprises. It's not what you think, Lana. Wayne and I went down there, and he was waving it around. I was too embarrassed to really look. I'm sorry. I wouldn't care anyway if it was a foot long. I think he's a pumped up moron. Hey, Blue Eyes, how are you doing? You know what? I hear you've been asking all around about me. I've got to tell you, Blue Eyes, there's always space in my heart for one more. I could bring you back to life. Oh, come on, give us a smile, or give us a dance. They're playing our song. You see, she's very sweet, but she breaks my heart all the time. Would you ladies mind if I should sit with you for a minute? No, not at all. Thank you very much. Can we get another glass over here? Whoa, ladies curling, you ladies celebrating tonight? Win or lose, we always celebrate. That's good. I like that. Celebrate life, no matter what. You know you have a very beautiful face. No, really, it's very strong. You have a lot of strength. You must take care of a lot of people, but you're lonely. You're carrying too much weight on your shoulders. How do you know that? It's in your eyes, Miss. It's in your eyes. Excuse me. Well, what's the matter, Darling. You seem to be in terrible pain. You got that right, buddy. You know what? I can help you. What? You going to do my shift tonight? Well, no, no, really, really, I can help you. People say I have a gift with my hands. Can I try? I mean, you have nothing to lose, like humor me, indulge me. I'll just try, two minutes. All right. OK. I have to get my hands warm first. Now I have to put my hands directly on your skin. Is that all right? Show me the pain, where it is. OK. Just relax. It's OK. Good, just breathe. Relax, it's OK. Now look at me, look into my eyes. Give me your pain. Give it to me. I'm open. Give it to me. Give me your pain. Give it to me now. It's gone. The pain is gone. Phrum. Isn't that great? Tonight, all your drinks are on me, OK? That's good. I like that. That's a good idea. He doesn't look like a moron to me. Looks aren't everything. You stupid fucking bitch. See, I think that we all have a gift. And our job in life is fairly simple. It is just to try and become what we already are and to share that gift with others. Anyway, that's what I think. Hey, Blue eyes, how come you left your home to come and live so far away? Not because I was breaking the conditions of my parole. To remember me by. It's big. Jesus. Ma'am? Ma'am, you OK? Oh, man. Ma'am, it's all right. We're here to help you. It's OK. You're OK. Take a deep breath. Who did this to you? Nobody. I told them already, nobody did this. I was lost in the bush. It must be I fell and cut myself like that. Sometimes when you love somebody and they hurt you, it just seems like part of the deal. But it isn't. Love isn't about being hurt or hurting someone else. How many children do you have, Lise, out at the commune? Baby Maria, Yvonne, and Marc. Well, maybe you don't care about yourself. But how do you imagine they must feel to see their mother so hurt? What effect do you think that's going to have on them their whole lives? - I don't know. I don't know what to think. Well, the hospital is going to discharge you later today. There's a place at the women's shelter for you to stay, to recuperate. Do you understand? Yes. Will you go there? You need to sleep, some good food, time to heal, to think. Will you go? Yes, I'll go. Thank you. It was Moses who did this to you, wasn't it? No. Moses is a good man. Don't say such a thing. I'll see you tomorrow. There you go. Lise, I can't understand. You're a beautiful and bright woman. You don't deserve to be treated so badly. I mean, he keeps you a virtual prisoner out there. No, we are not prisoners. We can go any time. Marie-Claude left a week past to her parents in St. Felicien. Good, I'm glad to hear that. But you understand, Lise, it's not right for one man to control and manipulate. Roch is not a man. He's the prophet Moses. No, he's... he's just a man. Oh. How did they find you? They are my family. They will always find me. Lise, Lise, what's her last name, Marie-Claude's last name? Gauthier. So what I need from you is permission to drive up there and meet with her and find out what she's got to say. - No. - What do you mean, no? No means no around here. Is there some ambivalence about the word where you come from? No, I do not give you permission to go traipsing about in Quebec, outside our jurisdiction, to find somebody who is unlikely to talk to you anyway. We have got cases up our yin-yang, Paula, not enough hours in the day, not near enough money to do our job properly. Roch's harem isn't even a fucking case. Where's your head? Did you see the photographs of that woman's back? I have seen hundreds of photographs, hundreds in the flesh. I don't think that there's an atrocity that you could name that I haven't seen. And what's more, I've managed to keep my professional wits about me all these years. You're too involved, Paula. You're going to get hurt, and you're going to hurt the people that you most want to help. Think about it. Fine. Perhaps you're unaware of the fact that I've not taken any leave from this job for 22 months. This is in flagrant disregard of my rights as a member of the public sector service union. So I'm taking one week of the six owed me, and I'm taking it out. Then fuck off, you pretentious English... Oh, fuck off, yourself, you ignorant bohunk. Bohunk. Fuck off, then, and good luck. They were a sight for sore eyes when they'd come in. The seven-year-old, he just crawled around on all fours, made noises like an animal. My granddaughter, she didn't even know how to eat, Papa. I'd like to kill that bastard. Hello, Marie-Claude. I'm Paula. Do you remember me? She was very badly beaten, whipped by the looks of it. And there were old scars as well as new. Do you remember such beatings taking place? What do you want from me? I want you to come forward and tell me and tell the police what you saw at the commune. I want you go to court and tell the judge, tell the truth about Roch and what he did to you and what he continues to do to the others. No, I can't do that. That would be the end of me. What are you afraid of, Marie-Claude? You're safe. Your children are safe. My children are not safe. Alinne, my daughter, is still there. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know. - Didn't know. I can get her out. How? You have to press charges against Roch. I'm afraid it's too late. She's almost dead. Do you understand me, Marie-Claude. I can get her out. I can get them all out, but you'll have to testify in court. OK. OK, I'll do it. I don't care. If I don't get her out, that will be the end of her. Roch's children were the privileged ones. The others fathered by Danny and Alphonse were the slaves. Roch is like god, you see. The slaves, they had to do whatever the others tell them. Suzette wanted to run away, but Lynne and Magdalene told Roch, so Roch gave them some of his beer, and he made love with them in the kitchen. And he asked them to beat Suzette with the chairs. And would the children be there when he made love to the women in the kitchen, when he beat Suzette? Yes, of course, the children were always there so they couldn't leave. And was there anybody else, Marie-Claude, who wanted to leave and was punished? Almost everyone at one time or another. One time, Lise, she was making plans to go to her grandparents. She didn't tell anyone except Marc. He's her oldest. He's only seven. So Marc went right away to Roch to tell him. Marc, I want you to stand in front of your mother. Now your mother's been bad. And you know what we do to bad people. I want you to punish your mother now. Now! Again. Harder. Harder! I'm so afraid. If I see him again, he will pull me back. He's so strong. He knows everything. Where are we going, Mama? Now this is very important. You can keep your children with you if you agree to leave the commune. Do you understand what I'm saying? As long as you agree to have nothing more to do with Mr. Theriault, we will not take the children away from you. Lise, what are you thinking? Name. Suzette Gillman, Jacques, nine, Silvie, eight, Fredrick, seven, Martin, two. Suzette, you know you can keep them with you. What are you thinking? I'm thinking you have a worm's eye view, Madame. For us, the picture is much bigger. Moses shows us the way to God, to our higher selves, if you like. You and the others, the bureaucracies and the governments, are blinkered by your own fear of life. That's what I'm thinking. Name? Leah, four years old, Emily, seven years old. Take my children away from me? Mother fucker! Damn you! Damn you. Ah! Mr. Theriault, I'm Rene Juneau. These are my colleagues, Colette Plamondon. Very nice to meet you. Marcelle Martin. Well, Mrs. Jackson has shown us the way here. But we are independent assessors, and we have nothing to do with Children's Aid. We're here at the demand of the court in in order to evaluate the situation. Yes, yes, of course, I know, I know. I understand. Please, meet everyone. Come, come, come. Let's go in. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, bravo, bravo, my friend. Hey, tonight we will feast on your labors, eh. Hey, looks like it. Oh, it's a nice one. This is how God intended a man to live, to fish, to hunt, to grow your own food, to be close to nature, respected by our women and our children, free, not like a slave to a machine of bureaucracy, petty office politics, eh? Free. Yeah. You know, like the English, they're not bad people. But a lot of the time they treat us like shit, no? They're prejudiced. They make us out to be stupid, simple-minded. Yes, yes, my grandmother, she had to work for Anglos. Yeah, yeah, you see, and it's not really different today. They don't understand our language. So they can't be bothered trying to understand who we are, you know, what we dream of, how we want to change the world for the better. It's a damn shame, you know. People can't make a go of it without two paychecks anymore. And even so, the government takes half of it in taxes, no? You see, I think and God thinks that the job of a woman is to take care of her children, take care of a man. Nobody's got a proper life anymore. There's no time. Everybody's tired. See, we live in an age where to be a good citizen, we have to give up our rights, not like in the '60s, eh. Oh, my, those were the days, for sure. Paris, '68, my sister and I lived in a commune just outside. Nearly 200 people, everything was possible. Everything was allowed. Yes, exactly as God intended. See, you're very lucky, Marcelle. Most people, you know, they're afraid of what's most natural. Ashamed of their bodies, ashamed of their thoughts even. Yet, nature herself is sexual, the life force, Marcelle, the life force. Those government workers, you know, they're like eunuchs. They're afraid of what they've never experienced. They think I'm a bad man, that I'm a monster because I make love to so many women. But I love my wives. I don't lie to them. I have the deepest respect, the deepest affection for them. You know, not like those upstanding men, you know, with the ties. And they have one wife but plenty of mistresses. I have to hand it to you, Roch, you're not a hypocrite. What is it... What's it all about? Ross Johnson, assistant therewith the deputy minister's office in Toronto. This has just come in from the independent assessors. They are unanimous in their report. They find that the children should be returned to Roch and their mothers without delay. Are they all mad? All right, everybody, please. I'm sorry. I mean to cast no aspersions on the court-appointed assessors, but I am surprised by their findings, that's all. Paula Jackson is the head of our Children's Aid division. Ah. There's something else. Would you mind repeating what you told me? Certainly. We have decided not to proceed with the judicial hearing. The children shall be returned to their parents. I beg your pardon. What did you say? Mrs. Jackson, never has a judge overturned a unanimous report from an independent assessment team in this province ever. To proceed would be a waste of taxpayers' money. As a matter of curiosity, have you watched any of the 30-some odd hours of videotape that we've compiled of the children currently in care, or read the transcripts to Marie-Claude Gauthier's testimony? What would be the point? Well, the point would be that our findings contradict the assessor's unanimous report. Our unanimous findings are that the children from the Church River commune were... Are victims of systematic physical and mental and sexual abuse. The point would be that in washing your hands of this particular case, you would, in fact, be throwing innocent children back into the jaws of hell. And I'm not being overly dramatic. Mrs. Jackson. Just one more point to make, sir, Mr. Johnson, isn't it? Yes. Should these children be returned to Roch Theriault and his followers, I guarantee that the abuse will continue and will eventually come to light in the press and in the courts. And I will see to it personally that blame is laid where it most belongs, on the government, on the department, on the minister, and you, both of you. No. Mrs. Jackson, you've made a very strong case. Therefore, the hearing will go forward. The slaves, they had to do whatever the others tell them. Many times, they didn't get enough to eat. Sometimes when he was drinking, he was taking two of the babies by the legs and holding them over the fire. The mothers, me, I was one, wept and begged him for mercy. Did he ever drop a baby in the fire, Mrs. Gauthier? No. When a baby cried too much, he... He would take them by the feet and throw them in the snowbank. All the babies, they learned real fast not to cry. Please go on. Sometimes he was crucify the children by hanging them in the bush with nails through their clothes. Then he would call everyone to come and throw stones to them until they're dead. And did he ever follow through? No, nobody ever got killed, like he said. Thank you. Over this past week, I have, of course, read the report of the independent assessors. I have also read the written testimony of the foster parents of those children currently in care. And I have watched many, many hours of videotape of the children in question, compiled by the Children's Aid workers in this district. Have you by any chance watched these tapes yourselves? No, your Honor. We'll give you a taste. No, no, no! No! No! No! No! No! No, no! I don't understand, Marie. Why is it that you and Richard have such wonderful manners, and your brother Leon won't even sit at the table for lunch. Leon is a slave. Why is that? Why is he a slave, and you and Richard aren't? Moses isn't his Poppy. You just tell us in your own words what went on. You're a very bright, well-spoken girl. Sometimes the adults, they'd dance in a big circle with their pants off around a fire. Next, us kids would join in the dancing. Then, a whole bunch of adults, they'd like naked on the ground and touch each other. What about you kids, Alinne? Did the adults ever touch you in funny ways? Or did they ever want you to touch them? Poppy likes me to pull on his penis. Everybody's doing it, including mom. Mom and me would take turns. And when white stuff came out, Poppy would get up. But Poppy likes the really little kids to play with his penis. He thinks I'm too old now. He's ready. It's time. It is extremely rare for the court to find against the unanimous recommendation of an independent assessment team that the court has itself appointed. In this case, however, the court finds the submission to be the most deplorable it has ever seen. Their findings are both disconcerting and illogical. The finding of the court is clear and unequivocal. Roch Theriault is a calculating dictator, who has taken over the lives of his followers and controls them like sheep. There is no doubt in my mind that the children, should they be returned, run a substantial risk of being sexually molested or exploited. And I hereby order that they be made permanent wards of the crown with no parental access. The exception is Alinne Gauthier, who shall be returned to her mother Marie-Claude on condition that the two accept any form of therapy or psychiatric care that might be recommended by the CAS. Furthermore, any future children born to members of the commune will be apprehended at once and placed into the permanent wardship of the state. This court is adjourned. I just can't believe that you're not going to proceed. Look, can you try to lighten up, please? I mean, tonight we've got a... we've got a real reason to celebrate here. Tomorrow's another day. I'm such a bore. I just, uh... I can't help thinking that things are going to get worse for the women out there now that the kids are gone. I mean, there's over 100 documented offenses that you could charge him with, physical, sexual, mental abuse, abandonment, neglect, each one worse then the next. Look, the guy should be drawn and quartered, as far as I'm concerned. But that's not going to happen. I mean, to charge Theriault would be nothing but a nightmare. The only adult witness we've got is Marie-Claude. She's a complete basket case. Want to drag those kids through months of court dates and contradictory evidence, huh? I guarantee you, the only upshot is going to be increased trauma for those kids and nothing else, Paula. Yeah, but it's not right. It's not fair that Roch should go unpunished. Of course, it's not fair. Life isn't fair. - But? What is it that you want? I want the women... I want the women safe, too, dammit. Leave it alone, Do you hear me? Please drop it. You can't help people that won't help themselves. But that's what we're here for, isn't it? Isn't it? Hello, Lise. Takes all of you with him wherever he goes now. I'm surprised you're not shackled one to another. Where's Suzette? Suzette? Oh, Suzette. She's having a little holiday with her parents. She's... What the fuck more do you want from us, eh? What? All of you, come here. Now! I want you to look at this. She's the devil's bitch herself, always looking for trouble, always in heat, eh, Blue Eyes. Get in the van now. Get in the goddamn van. Now, faster, shit. Get in the van. You stupid bitch. Huh, you stupid bitch. You stupid fucking bitch, stupid bitch. You'll be back. You'll be back, you stupid bitch. You'll be back. I'm sorry, Paula, I'm sorry. I love you so much. I'm sorry. Please don't be frightened. There's no one else, only me. I just want to talk to you as a woman. Perhaps we could have a cup of tea? I'm here because I worry about you, all of you. I can't stop thinking about the situation you're in here. And... and I know something about you all that perhaps the others don't. I know that when you met Roch, each one of you separately, you felt completely in love with him because he saw who you really were. He saw your loneliness and longing, your lack of direction, your sorrow, anxiety. He saw you, and he loved you because of and in spite of who you were. He promised to cherish you and protect you forever. He promised to show you the way with only one small condition, that you give yourself over to him completely. You surrender yourself to his love, his vision, his genius. And even only on, before the physical violence, he could look at you with such cold contempt. It was like a knife in the heart, always judging you for what you wore, a contrary opinion, the way you put butter on the toast in the morning. And so the fear begins, doesn't it? Fear that he'll stop loving you, throw you out of the safety net that he's wrapped you in. Fear that makes you walk on eggshells, watching and listening for the slightest hint of disapproval or annoyance. Always tense, afraid that you're going to say or do the wrong thing at the wrong time. And the first time he actually hits you, oh, it's a relief. And afterwards, he's so sorry, and his declarations of love are so sincere that, yes, you love him more than ever. Loving him is your life's work. So it goes on. The beatings get worse. His odd sadistic pleasures, he hurts and manipulates your children, and he turns them against you. And he keeps you underfed and underslept and overworked. And some days, you don't even know your own name. Paula, how do you know all these things? Hm, I know because I've been there. I was married to a man like Roch. I was beaten senseless more times than I can remember. And through it all, I still thought he loves me. He really loves me, this I know. And then, one day, I understood, he didn't love me. He didn't know me at all. He was just in love with my fear of him. And without it, he was nothing, no one. And I realized then that I'd rather be dead than spend another second with him. I wasn't afraid anymore. I was free. Speak of the devil. You stupid bitch. I should kill you. You're trespassing on my property, trying to steal my things. These aren't things, Roch. They're human beings. They're not things. I will kill you. And nobody's ever going to find you. Well, what's stopping you? Go ahead. Look, kitchen knives over there, take your pick. You see, I'm not afraid of him. I'm not afraid, so he can't hurt me. He's not Moses. He's not God. He's just another fucking asshole. Please, get out now and go, go, for us, please. It looks bad. I think the arm has got to go. It's a good thing I'm here, no? Oh, my god. What happened to you? Oh, oh! Gayle! Clear the way, please, clear the way, please. Please, back up. OK, please give her some air. Let us deal with this. Just back away, please, back away. It was Moses who did this to you, wasn't it? Come on, Lise, you must tell me. It was Roch, wasn't it? Yes. Call Vern. Oh, my god, what have I done? Let's go. Hello? Hello? Anybody? Anybody in here? Anybody home? Hello? It doesn't look like anyone's been here for a week. Police officer. Hello? Stove's still warm. They can't be far. We're going to need more men. Over here. Mr. Theriault, come out now. Mr. Theriault, come out now. Remove your belt. Remove your knife. Let them drop. But I'll do that, Officer, but if my pants fall off, you'll soon learn that my eyes are not the best part of me. You are under arrest for the aggravated... I'm guilty. I confess. I'm guilty. Guilty, guilty, guilty. Hi. That looks terrible. What is it? I don't know. But if I eat, they promise to take this out. You won't believe this. I don't believe this. But Roch pleaded guilty to aggravated assault at the preliminary hearing. He's being sentenced to 12 years in prison. You're free now. He can't hurt you anymore. It's a mystery, though, why he would forego a proper trial. Well, I suppose we should just be thankful and leave it at that. At least you don't have to go to court and testify against him. I've got something for you. I'd better go. Oh, by the way, I did manage to contact Suzette's parents. They said they hadn't heard from her in years. Any thoughts on where she might have gone? Paula, is Rochy... He's really going to jail? Yes. He's really gone for a long, long time. I must tell you then. Roch, he killed Suzette. We've been digging along time, but it's weird. A lot of bones are missing. Hi. Hi. We've got Lise's testimony, and we have a dead body, what's left of it. It'd be nice to get some corroboration. Come on. We found Suzette's body. We know that Roch killed her. We need you to come forward and tell us what you witnessed, what you saw that night. Please. You're free now. Roch's in prison. He can't hurt you anymore. What are you frightened of? You are my sisters, everyone. I love you. I'll love you always, no matter what happened. What Moses teach us, he was wrong. Love is not to hurt people or make them do what you want. This is not the will of God. Love is a better thing than that. Suzette was made to work very hard with a wheelbarrow and a shovel. She was working so hard it was affecting her breathing. Roch was mad at her. He thought she was too outspoken. She had stomach problems for some time. He didn't like this either. Roch thinks nobody should be sick but him. He asked me to prepare a solution of molasses and water. He had a red rubber bag made for enemas. He, erm... he put the enema tube in and moved it in and out. It was very rough. After that, he cut her with a knife and pull out some intestines. She never cried out, not once. She died the day after. We buried her. But after, we dig her up three times. Roch was mad. He was crazy for missing her. He made a necklace from her rib, so she could rest on his heart. Some of the others made necklaces, too. He slammed Marie-Claude on the floor when she was six months pregnant. He poured boiling water on Danny's back. He shoot Magdalene on her shoulder. He belt the Belgian workhorse to death with a chain and made. On his arm with a broken bottle. He cut Lena's finger off with the wire cutters. Well, good day, my friend. Please sit down. I'm sorry, but I can't offer you anything, not even a glass of water. I'm not here for the hospitality, Roch. I'm here to charge you with the murder of Suzette Gillman. Suzette? Yeah. Suzette was my wife, my beloved. I wouldn't have hurt her for the world. What kind of sick country is this when you can fabricate lies and... That's mine! You want to tell me Suzette's walking around minus a rib? Please, please, it's all I have left of her. Please give it to me. Please, please, it's mine. It's mine! It's mine! It's mine! I loved her, you understand? I loved her. I tried to save her by giving her an operation. But please, please, please, let me hold her. Let me hold her, please. Please. OK, look, just try to relax, OK. Like I said, because of the plea bargain, you won't have to testify. You don't have to do anything at all. I don't know, I'm... I'm afraid just to see him. Tell you what, if he looks at you, just do this. Hey! You did the right thing. Everything's going to be all right. Mr. Theriault, you have anything to say to this court before sentencing? Ahem. I do, your Honor, I do. I do come before you in good faith. I realize that the justice system did its duty by placing me behind bars. Over several years, I have made an odious character of myself, a cruel master, undetectably compelled by my own will, by debauchery, by the oddities of my way of thinking into which I mixed love, hate, religion, alcohol, and violence. I have inflicted on myself and others mental wounds which have left invisible scars that I will carry inside forever. Some of these scars will remain vivid, such as the ones created when I carried out the folly of my fury, traumatizing, mutilating, inflicting pain and suffering on the members of my entourage and, more specifically, the events that led to the death of my beloved wife, Suzette. I have made a criminal of myself, but please, please allow me to plead clemency for those who may have put themselves at risk before the law and before society by coming to live in the slavery of that hell. I, and I alone, was the leader of that commune, and I take full responsibility for any and all misdeeds that were committed during its existence. With dignity and I think a new sense of integrity, I will serve any sentence this court deems suitable. This court sentences you to life in prison with no possibility of parole for 10 years. What's wrong? Nothing is wrong, Vern. It's all over now. They're back in the land of the living.
