[dramatic music] (man over P.A.) 'All military personnel to Silo A4 immediately.' [music continues] 'Code-9 alert.' 'Defensive procedures are now in effect.' (male #1) Alright, let's go, let's go! (male #2) 'Take that, stand back.' 'Civilian personnel, evacuation done.' 'Civilian personnel, evacuation done.' 'Group 9, alert.' 'Defensive procedures now in effect.' 'Defensive procedures now in effect.' 'Murphy, report to level S6' (male #3) 'Told you, Simms. We've run outta time.' (Simms) 'Try database D.' (male #3) 'It's useless. This equipment is useless.' (Simms) 'I don't wanna hear your bullshit! Just keep trying.' [music continues] This is insanity. The President will never go for this. Stop, Bryant. Get this through that thick skull of yours. 'There is nobody else.' This isn't gonna work. [beeping] - 'Bryant, come here. Quick' - What've you got? (Simms) 'Shit!' [firing] [firing continues] (Simms) 'Goddammit. What is he gonna do?' (Simms) 'Damn, this equipment is outta the dark ages.' Can't do shit with this. I've got something. I found 11 long range S-S-20's. - Where? - Ukraine, just South of Kiev. Goddamn bastards kept it hidden from us for all these years. - Thank God for that. - You guys crazy? - The President will never-- - Forget the goddamn President. Anyway, we don't know whether he's dead or alive. [siren wailing] [firing continues] [music continues] They're getting closer. We're all gonna die. Simms, if we can re-route the computer uplink. - We may be able to launch them. - We can use the space station. We've gotta get through to Captain Raynor. (Bryant) 'They're under attack.' They haven't responded to any of our transmissions. We've gotta keep trying. Without Raynor, we're history. [firing continues] Caroline! [alarm blaring] No-o! [indistinct] - I'm gonna be gone. - No. You're gonna be alright. I'm gonna get us both outta here somehow. I love you, Michael Raynor. I always have and I always will. You're our last hope. [siren wailing] [explosion] [firing continues] [dramatic music] [music continues] [engine revving] [indistinct chatter] Dr. Withers, I got your preliminary data. (man over P.A.) 'Radioactive alert no longer in effect.' 'Radioactive alert no longer in effect.' - Hey. - Karen. What've we got? A UFO, possibly.. Electromagnetic readings are low. Checking for radiation. I've put it into an isolation field. - Any little green men? - Not tonight. Did you check with NORAD? Any unusual courses, unusual behavior? Nothing. Came down like a rock. Oh, God. Why does this stuff always happen at night? They always happen at night. For the past six years we both have been playing cat and mouse. So, it's always been in the middle of the night. Did they find any excess debris? Nothing yet. Look at this. 'It's not what I expected.' [softly] It's not.. Oh.. It's charred. It's organic matter. It means there's an oxygen base to whatever this thing is. Let's get this thing scanned. [equipment beeping] [beeping continues] [dramatic music] [machine whirring] [beeping continues] Maybe this is something we're not supposed to know about. Like an escape vessel? Yeah, but who escaped and from what? Something nasty. We've gotta get this thing outta here. I'm on it. - 'What've we got?' - Micro objects. Very advanced. 'Let me see.' - 'It looks standard.' - 'Super conductors on diamond.' I've never seen anything close to this. Chips are in my area of expertise. We checked the pod. Spectral emission show nothing unusual. But take a look at this. Even with our most advanced technology we're still fooling around with 32-bit buses. This is something I've never seen before. So, what you're saying is, this is advanced technology.. ...but the blood type, it's human. You think that's weird? 'Electrodyne Industries.' Indiana. I just crossed referenced through our second data bank. Electrodyne Industries, doesn't exist anywhere in the U.S. [helicopter whirring] We've got company. I thought this was a secret operation. So did I. [dramatic music] [whirring continues] [music continues] [music continues] Colonel Freeman, Intelligence and Security Command. I know who you are, Freeman. I.S.C. Very impressive. What's with all the man power? Donaldson, have your people packed up and outta here in one hour. - You know the procedure. - What procedure? We'll be taking over from here. My authorization, Ms. Donaldson. From the top. I want you people to secure all the data immediately. And nobody, I mean nobody leaves this site without being searched first. Yes, sir. You two men, come with me. I want confirmation for this authorization. I'm not giving up my investigation. Your investigation is over. You've got one hour. We'll see about this. Donaldson, don't screw with me. Up to now, you've been a good, little girl scout. Don't blow it. I've got my orders, now you've got yours. This situation is not for publication of the Air Force. Nor to any other cell members. Do we understand each other? (male #4) 'Hey, you. Over there.' 'Nobody leaves the area without being searched.' - What should we do? - What the man says. So we just forget about all this? Walk away from it? It doesn't sound like you. No, it doesn't. Does it? [dramatic music] [wings flapping] [crow cawing] [insects chirping] [horses galloping] [cow mooing] [crow cawing] [birds chirping] [door creaks open] [clock ticking] [fire crackling] [dramatic music] [swishing] What the.. [music continues] Who the hell are you? - Whe-where are you from? - You just relax. Nobody's gonna get hurt. - I'm calling the sheriff. - Sit down! I want some answers. Like, where the hell am I? Jackson County. Close to Wheaton. United America? I don't know what you're talking about, but.. This is Washington state. - What day is it? - Day? Wednesday, but.. October 6th, 1992. The wormhole. Jesus. This can't be happening. I don't know nothing about any worm whatever. You mentioned a town. Wheaton, a mile or so south on the main road outside there.. A wind. The Air Force base, of course. I'm gonna need some clothes. Call it a loan. [sirens wailing] This isn't gonna work. Without Raynor-- Forget about him. He doesn't exist. If he got through the wormhole and survived there'll be a better place than this if we don't do something. Murphy, what if he went into the past? - Suppose he did-- - He might be able to-- Give it up, Bryant. [crow cawing] [vehicle approaching] The pod. What's happened to the pod? [crow cawing] My only link. [wings flapping] [eagle screeching] [xylophone music] Where the hell is that sheriff? I must have called over an hour ago. [intense music] Who the hell are you? Colonel Freeman, I.S.C. Where is he? What are you doing here? Where did he go? - Search the place. - Yes, sir. What are you guys doing? Where is he? How the hell should I know? He's some escape lunatic or something. What did he look like? Blue eyes. Medium height. He took my jeans. Stole my brown leather jacket. What did he say? I told you. He was nuts. Talked about worms or something. Worms? 'Yeah.' What are you guys doing? You can't just come in here and-- Oh, yes. Yes, we can. [grunting] [bones cracking] [grunting] [country music over radio] [door opens] [music continues] [intense music] You're not from around here, are you? - Do I know you? - Oh, I'm afraid not. You wouldn't have the scan, uh...telephone number of the.. ...Air Force base, just outside town. It's over here. I'll get it for you. [dramatic music] Afternoon, Mabel. - The usual? - Yep. (man over radio) 'In other news another meteorite was spotted last night.' 'Military sources say that most of the meteorite' 'was destroyed on impact.' Could you put a shred of rye in that? Of course. You! Come here. Have you seen anyone.. '...unusual this morning?' (Mable) 'You mean, besides you?' Don't try my patience, lady. (male #5) 'Mabel, your Number 6 is ready.' 'Mabel, your Number 6 is ready!' I expect an answer. Hey, take it easy. I don't know nothing. (man over radio) 'This, I promise to you, the people of this great..' [ringing tone] 'God bless you all..' [screaming] [sobbing] It's him! Get down! [screaming] [screaming continues] [screaming] [grunts] [glass shattering] [tires screeching] Come on, get in! Hurry up! [gunshots] [alarm blaring] (male over P.A.) 'Battle station.' - 'Alien enforces.' - 'Advancing on position.' 'Battle station.' [alarm blaring] Sir. Anders has been completely destroyed. Along with Neradin Sac. We could be overrun at any moment. Just make sure we've got enough time before the party begins. Yes, sir. [alarm blaring] 'I think we've lost Freeman.' Who are you? Karen Donaldson, Special Projects. Astrophysics, Washington State. Special Projects? Yeah, like you. And what would someone like you know about me? Well, I know that you came down in that pod. And I know you're responsible for the advanced technology. Technology that doesn't exist. What about our little friend back there? He's in the military. I just wanna know why you're helping me? I'm curious. About me? Yes, and about why Freeman is so hot on your trail. [flinching] 'Argh!' Oh, Jesus. What are we gonna do? I don't know. But no hospitals. [dramatic music] They'll find me. 'Well, I know where we can go.' [dog barking] Carl! 'Carl!' - Karen. - 'Carl, help me.' - Who's this? - Electrodyne Industries. - You look bad. Holy shit. - Yeah. [groaning] [grunting] - Where should we put him? - Take him in my bedroom. - Be careful. - Yeah. [grunting] Oh, man! Ah! (Karen) 'Ugh!' Oh. It looks like the bullet went right through. My pouch. Dermaplast, in my pouch. What? Spray it on. 'Aah!' What is it? It...stops the bleeding. Regenerates cells. 'Who the hell is this guy, Karen?' [heavy breathing] Raynor? Raynor? So much for my interrogation. This is crazy. 'What are we gonna do with him?' [Karen sighing] We're gonna let him rest. Okay. You better hide your car. I'll be right back. You stay inside. Okay. Carl. You don't have to explain anything. - If Freeman catches us-- - I never liked Freeman. Gives me the creeps. [door shuts] [dog barking] [engine revving] [barking continues] (Karen) 'He said, it carried him 30 years into the past.' (Carl) 'A wormhole.' Theoretically, they exist. - Nah, but that's incredible. - Well, that's what he said. And he was trying to escape some kind of alien invasion. An alien invasion of earth. Either he's out of his mind or...we're in very deep shit. But we need proof. And so does he, if he wants anyone to believe his story. Maybe that's why Freeman's after him. But Freeman wants something more. Like the flight recorder. And I know where they're hiding it. You! You're one of them, aren't you? Aren't you? You didn't even know you were hit. (Carl) 'What's going on in there?' It's okay, Carl. So the invasion's already begun. I don't know what you're talking about. A trap. And I was stupid enough to walk right into it. This is the way it all started, isn't it? Freaks like you, infiltrating. Scouting out the lay of the land and then you move in for the kill. I'm seeing history in the making. There is no invasion. That's not why we're here. I was there. I saw it. I know how it all turns out, remember? I saw a million ships out there on the edge. [buzzing] [grunting] Shit! Raynor.. [screaming] [dramatic music] My flight recorder. [buzzing continues] What was that? I don't know. It happened before, this morning. So vivid. It was a look at my future. I have to go there. But if you go there, you'll die. I don't have a choice. [dog barking] [crows cawing] I think we have a serious problem. Freeman just showed up with a couple of his goons. - 'We've to get going.' - We've gotta go. Look, I'm on your side. Let's go. I'll keep our friends busy. Take these. 'Can't use your car. They'll be looking for it.' 'I'll stall Freeman.' - Colonel Freeman. - Yeah. I know who you are. - What do you want? - Where are they? - Where's who? - Don't play games, Withers. Where are they? Get down! Uh! Oh! Get 'em! Look out! They're right behind us. [gunshots] [gunshots] [gunshots] Come on, step on it. [gunshots] Arnie! Turn that shit down and go get a lube job. 'Arnie?' Ah, go fuck yourself, turd brain. [intense music] [gunshots] 'This guy's crazy!' [country music over radio] 'Are you sure you know what you're doing?' (Raynor) 'I'm doing the best I can.' That was close. [gunshots] Right there. There's the airport. Hope there's a plane. Oh my God! Come on, hurry! [engine revving] [intense music] I hope Carl's alright. He's a good man. - Do they know about you? - 'No.' That bastard, Freeman. He knows something's going on - 'and I'm not in on it.' - Must be someone you can go to. We operate in blind cells. I've never known who our authority is.. ...but obviously Freeman does. 'Raynor, what was that?' 'Was that actually a look into our future?' Possibly. It's got something to do with the effects of time travel. It centers around me, but affects anyone near me. See, the first time it happened was this morning. In the vision the waitress was killed, but I saved her. That means I can affect 'em. You look worried. There could be two of me. Oh! See, in this time, right now, I haven't been born yet. It was the wormhole that brought me here. (Karen) 'A time anomaly.' We've gotta get to that flight recorder. - Stop this before it starts. - 'In the vision, you died.' I know. I just hope I can stop that too. [gasping] Aliens, right? - 'Who the hell are you?' - Your hostage, man, what else? Arnie Hawksworth. So, uh, you two gonna fill me on what's going down here? Do you know where the old hanger on the air base is? - Uh-huh. - 'Can you get us there?' Look, forget it. I took a joyride ride in this crate once flew over the place. We're talking major military camp. But.. ...I do know a place nearby. Get your truck, maybe take the back roads. - And you'll take us there? - Why not? I'm what you might call adventurous. By the way, you're almost outta gas. Heard a shot. Your tank's probably got a hole in it. Shit. (Arnie) 'We're losing power.' [engine spluttering] (Raynor) 'We're going down here, folks.' (Arnie) 'Just land this thing! Will you?' (Raynor) 'Leave the flying to me, will you? I know what I'm doing.' (Arnie) 'Look, there's-there's a barn!' [alarm blaring] [engine revving] (Arnie) 'Oh, God!' Nice landing, Raynor. This is the right place? You bet. Truck's right over here. Don't tell me. This thing runs? You bet. Three fifty four barrel. My friend, Harry, runs the odd late night load in it. Oh! What kind of a business does your buddy run? Hey, you don't wanna know. You'll need these. [engine cranking] (male over P.A.) 'Rear guard to Main Level 3.' (male #6) 'Mr. President.' We're glad to see you still alive, sir. Just what do you people think you're up to? We've found some missiles near Kiev. We're tracing the launching code through our data bank. It's near impossible to find. If we do that, we'll be able to blow those bastards back to where they came from. You will do no such thing. I have not devoted my entire life.. ...every ounce of my being.. ...to maintain some humanity, some sense of reason.. ...to see it all destroyed in one impulsive stroke by you near-sighted fools. Mr. President, it's too late for that. I will tell you when it is too late. Don't you presume to know what is the greater good. We cannot hope to defeat their armies. To defend ourselves further will lead to genocide. Our salvation leaves us with a single choice. And in the end, it is I who will choose. You see, I have contacted the aliens. Treaty has been negotiated. They are prepared to stop the invasion if we end our resistance now. - You are jeopardizing-- - ...the blood of our people. - You expect us to-- - There will be no missile fire. You will stop this insanity. 'Now.' [alarm blaring] Now! Go, go, go, go, go! 'What is that thing?' Go, go, go, go, go! They're closing in on us. [machine gun firing] [firing continues] 'Move it! Move it!' Get that thing! 'Fire! They're closing in on us!' Stop those bastards! Fire! [screaming] [coughing] (male over P.A.) 'Internal security breach.' 'Internal security breach.' This is an act of treason. Mr. President, let's just agree to disagree. Ah! Uh! Please, sir. Don't make me do this. Arnie, you stay here and keep an eye out. Wait, I thought I was going with you guys. We may need to get out of here in a hurry. Okay, I'll hang out here. You know the way up. Lead on. [gasps] Jesus! Arnie! You were supposed to wait in the truck. - Thought I heard something. - Quiet. This way. [distant chattering] 'Cargo Dock Level 1, receiving.' - Hey, Raynor. - Yeah? If those aliens you told me about look human.. ...how do we know the difference? They don't feel pain. - Yeah, but how do we-- - Look. If they shoot at you, they're probably aliens. Now, keep it down. I've got to find that flight recorder. I'll try this way. [dramatic music] [indistinct chattering] - What have you got? - I got something. [equipment beeping] [beeping continues] [clattering] Ah! [timer beeping] Uh! (man over P.A.) 'Intruder! Intruder on premises.' 'Intruder! Intruder on premises.' Ah! 'Save the pod!' Come on! Come on! 'There he is!' 'There's only two of them.' I got it. Now, let's get out. We've only got a few minutes. 'Down to your right!' 'Hurry, hurry, hurry!' Come on, come on, come on! Move! Oh! Hurry! [machine gun firing] This way. Hurry! 'They've gone out the back side.' This way, this way. Go, go, go, go! Down the rafters! Come on, come on, come on! Only a few seconds. Come on! Hurry, hurry, hurry! Hold on! 'Getting out the back!' Let's go! Come on, come on! 'Don't let 'em get away!' 'Move!' [machine gun firing] [explosion] Come on, let's go! [men shouting] I think I'm on to something. There are millions of others to consider. I can guarantee your safety. They will listen to me. [firing continues] [engine revving] Karen, you say you're not really human? Too bad. You're better looking than Mrs. Carol back home. Thanks, Arnie. You're more human than you think. [car honking] Okay. (Arnie) 'Seattle, everybody.' 'Found it all by myself.' Thanks for helping us back there. Ah, it was nothing. 'I think the street we want should be the next right.' [dramatic music] [typewriter keys clicking] [machine beeping] [clicking continues] This stuff is so complicated. And this system is so outmoded I'm having trouble breaking the security code. 'It's not interfacing properly.' What if it got damaged, coming through the wormhole? Hold on. That's it. I got it. [beeping] I wanna know how we can use this. I think I can transfer it to laser disc. But we need to convince somebody. Somebody who can handle this information. Someone we can trust. [dramatic music] - Neila. - 'Neila?' John Neila. First senator. In my time, he's world president. He knew something was wrong. He's the one to see. And he's been hitting hard at all the money spent on the S.D.I. space station. If we had that when this all started 'we might have had a chance.' No, we've gotta get to this guy Neila. He's having a rally tomorrow. We'll be there. [scoffs] Well, that's the final irony, isn't it? 'What is?' Tomorrow is my birthday. Literally. Oh! Happy birthday, Raynor. [scoffs] I'm gonna finish this tomorrow. [footsteps] I love you, Michael Raynor. I always have and I always will. You're our last hope. I'm sorry. It's not your fault. I just wanted to let you know. I appreciate what you've done. I feel as though I've betrayed you. No, no. If anything, you were betrayed.. ...by your own people. You know.. ...for the first time.. ...I feel like I'm here for a reason. Maybe it's fate. If I can live in the past maybe I can change the future. I hope so. [siren wailing] [indistinct chattering] [guns firing] [indistinct shouting] [firing continues] [siren continues] [screaming] They're almost on our asses. Just get off mine and maybe we'll get somewhere. - 'I need more time.' - 'I'm afraid we don't have it.' [screaming] (Simms) 'It's here in the system. I know it.' 'It's some obsolete code.' [groans] They sacrificed their own lives for the sake of some impossible scheme. We're dead anyway. [siren wailing] There are millions of others to consider. (Simms) 'Make it happen, Murphy.' 'They're almost here.' I can guarantee your safety. [indistinct shouting] They will listen to me. Seems like they've made up their minds already, Mr. President. (Simms) 'The satellites have been linked up.' [firing and screaming continues] (Simms) 'Come on!' It'll just take a couple of seconds to kick in. Dammit! This stuff is 20 years old, Simms. You can't expect miracles. It's all we've got. Make it fucking work. They're in the next corridor. [screaming continues] (Simms) 'We can't let them destroy us.' I've got it! I've completed the dial uplink. We've got the launch codes. Don't do this. You'll destroy us all! Shut him up, Bryant! It's too late, son. [beeping] (Simms) 'Press the fucking button, Murphy.' Press the fucking button! - I'm almost. - Come on, come on! There! (woman over P.A.) 'Manual Launch sequence engaged.' - 'Ten, nine..' - Help me. '...eight, seven, six, five, four..' '...three, two, one, zero.' 'Manual launch sequence aborted.' 'Launch aborted.' (male alien #1) 'It's over now, sir.' [imitating alien] Your timing's impeccable. 'It is too bad.' [gunshot] [crowd applauding and cheering] Thank you. (President) We are a nation striving for a world without chaos. A world finally at peace with itself. 'I will do everything in my power..' - Arnie. - Yeah, I know. I'll wait here. '...like food for the hungry.' 'Shelter for the homeless..' Hey, buddy. Let's get this heap outta here. [crowd cheering] We must begin at the beginning. At the very grass roots.. '...of greed and gain..' ...that are rapidly choking the life out of this great nation. 'A world that is self-sustaining.' 'A beacon of hope for future generations.' 'Projects like the space station..' A bastion of fear at the expense of starving children. [cheering] It will be the goal of my office to ensure a world united without war or weapon. 'This, I promise to you.' [band music] God bless you all. God bless America. Thank you. God bless America. Thank you. [instrumental music] [crowd cheering] [music continues] Sir, we have to talk. This is urgent. Your life and the lives of millions depend on it. I know the world's a mess, but we have some time yet. I know everything about you, Mr. President. That's why we have to talk now, and in private. Future of the world, our very existence depends on it. Bring them along. [intense music] You won't need that weapon here. 'Why did you call me, Mr. President?' Sir.. I know you'll find this hard to believe. But I'm not of this time. I'm from the future. A future where you become world President. You say you're from the future. Can you prove it? [chuckles] You can either write me off as a lunatic.. ...or you can hear me out. I'm from the year 2022. We were under attack. My shuttle escape pod went into a wormhole. (President) 'A wormhole, what is that?' It's a.. ...a time displacement which brought me here 30 years in the past. Tell me more about becoming the world President. In 2021, all nations unite under a single ruling body. You became chairman. The world President. That's very interesting. We were just discussing that possibility. Weren't we, Mr. Freeman? [dramatic music] It's a setup. To bring me here. (President) 'Miss Donaldson, can you explain your traitorous acts?' - She's with us. - 'That's right, you moron.' You've been trying to kill him from day one. We could learn so much from him. He can help our plan. Further our cause. What about the flight recorder? You betrayed me. You are not of this time, Captain Raynor. Your presence here, it's inherently dangerous. We cannot allow, how shall I put this.. '...a second coming.' I think we've heard enough. [Michael grunts] Mother. No! [dramatic music] [tires screeching] Christ! I'm getting tired of this guy. Miss Donaldson. What is your first name? 'Karen.' Karen. Can you explain the killing of our people? I felt it was priority to keep Michael Raynor alive. At any expense? Yes. (Michael) Nice timing, Arnie. 'Get us outta here!' [tires screeching] Take it easy, will ya? There are enough guys trying to kill me already. (President) Perhaps you can shed some light on what just happened. I'm not sure exactly. It's like a dream. It's a vision of the future. A vision of our future. [car revving] Today is Captain Raynor's birthday. It must have something to do with his birth. The mother. We've gotta get to my mother before they do. - Your mother? - Yeah. If they kill her, I can't be born. If that happens.. ...well, I couldn't be sitting here next to you now. Ah, man. Look, this is really getting weird. Tell me about it. No Raynor and the world is ours. Eliminate the mother and all of our problems will be solved. Karen. I have a job for you. No, mom. I'm fine. Yes. I'm getting ready to go to the hospital now. No, I'll be okay. I'll meet you there, alright? Alright, bye. [car approaching] [dog barking] [kids screaming] [intense music] [footsteps approaching] - I think you missed the turn. - Oh, shit! That's alright. Take a right here. [screams] [gunshot] Oh, my God. Arnie, get rid of the body. Mrs. Raynor? I'm here to take you to the hospital. What's going on here? Who were these men? Don't worry about them now. We've gotta get you to the hospital. Look, I'm not going anywhere with you. I'm gonna call the police. [groans] You've got to trust me. Please. Please! Who are you? I'm here to help. Arnie, we're gonna need an ambulance. - Come on. - Okay. - You're gonna be okay. - Yeah. Come on. Yeah, look, we need an ambulance right away. Uh, the address. Oh, God. It's, um.. 531, East Roth. Yeah, yeah, I think. You got that? Great. Take it easy now. Here we go. [grunts] God, no! (Karen) 'Oh, Michael.' What happens now? [ambulance siren wailing] [groaning] I know it's hard. You can just keep pushing. [moaning] Hold on. Just hold on. [siren continues] Calm down. If you push a little more, we've almost got it. I can't. It hurts. (female #1) 'Keep on pushing.' I've got it. I've got it. Hand me those scissors. [baby crying] Is it okay? It's fine. What is it? It's a boy. [sobbing] His name is Michael. I know. [siren wailing] [groaning] Frank, you better hurry. We're losing her. How much further? How much further? Who are you? I'm...a friend. You rest now. You'll be alright. (female #2) 'Something wrong. The baby's not breathing.' - Michael. - 'He's not crying.' Nurse. Can't you do something? [beeping rapidly] I've lost you again. [tires screeching] What the hell are you doing? It won't matter to you. Now give me your gun. Get out of the truck. 'Come on, let's go.' Let's move. [machine beeping] Well, Captain Raynor. You certainly put a wrinkle or two in my campaign schedule. But no matter.. [imitating alien] ...I want the baby. 'I'm looking forward to see' what'll happen to you, captain.. ...when I kill the child. Give me the child. [guns firing] - Okay, Michael, be careful. - I will. Let's try this way. Go! [whispering] Arnie, where the hell are you? [alarm beeping] [screams] Arnie, think you can handle this? I think I can get 'em to follow me. Take risks. I'm going to find Karen. [dramatic music] [grunts] I saw you, Bank, corner pocket. [grunts] [music continues] Come on! I'll tear you apart, you little bag of shit. Eat my shorts! [grunts] God, I hit him. [grunts] [dramatic music] Karen. You alright? Yes, I am. How's he? He seems alright, but we need to get him to the hospital. We gotta go now. How about a picnic, ladies and gentlemen? Hello, Karen, my dear. - You're not getting this baby. - Yes, I am. I'm gonna deal with both Raynors today. The future and the present. You could've been part of our new world 'but you defied me for the last time.' I'm unarmed, Mr. Freeman. You wear your heart on your sleeve, don't you? We are the stronger and we will dominate. Are you gonna shoot me.. '...in cold blood?' It is my destiny. It's a long way down. No! [grunting] [screaming] [thud] I think your alien visa just expired. Are you alright? [grunting] [baby crying] - Michael. - Stay away. [baby continues crying] He did us all a big favor, didn't he, Karen? More than he'll ever know. (Michael narrating) If I can live in the past maybe I can change the future. [drums rolling] [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues]
