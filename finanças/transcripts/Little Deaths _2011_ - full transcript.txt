Homes Richard ... Shit. Jesus, Vee. - I warned you. It is no good, you're my wife. - Do not be boring. I saw her today. At the park. We must be careful after what happened last time. Caution? You want it just as much as I do. Everyone has needs, Richard. Only some have a different taste. I'm hungry. - Yeah, me too. There will be something soon. That guy is watching us. - Where? Over there. I saw him hanging around here earlier. What do you think? Cop or pervert? Tweedledum and Tweedledee. Jesus, what is cold. You have a decent meal is needed. Then you can put some strength back. Even rats eat better than us. - They are not picky. You have expensive preferences. Eat something decent. - I ate a sandwich at the club. Who were there? - Charles and a few of the boys. Any news? - There is never anything. What have you got pulled? I've been in the park. And? - She was there again. He also. He is always with her. - In the afternoon, they often hike alone. Things go better, I think. So it will be tomorrow? I would rather my work. - What do you want for dinner? Never mind. She eats all your hair attachments. They always do. That one girl did not eat fish. Took me hours to prepare the tongue. Pearls before swine, hell. If she has many strings to her singing, we'll send her to bed without food. I go to bed early. - Good night, Vee. Greasy. - That if I look a bit. Do not stay too long. I do not want you isturbing my sleep. I have come across a couple of minutes. - Good night, honey. Cattle ... - Yes? Do you sometimes it's wrong? It's just a pleasure. They have a meal and some money on. Besides, they remain unharmed. Mostly. I can not change. - You do not need. What do you want from me? I am not a whore or anything. - I should hope. What do you want? I am Richard. Richard Gull. I only have one question. Do you know Jesus? I've never met him. He knows you well. - I am everywhere and nowhere. I can not remember everyone. Listen, my wife and I want to do what we can for the needy. A meal, a hot bath, a few pounds in his pocket. Maybe even some optimism. We like to think that we give some hope to those who cross our path. It is not much in such a cruel world, but it is something. You and your wife? - Victoria. You may be her. Everyone does. Nice car you have. - The Lord is good to me. It shows. Was it a gift or do you repay him? One thing: My wife and I summarize our faith seriously. I would appreciate it if you respected. Yes, yes. Sorry. Not required. Let's just enjoy his generous gifts. Treasure ... I'm Victoria. - Sorrow. I was 'smart' are not normally welcome in my house. In your case I'll make an exception. Thanks. Come on you all the food? - Yes, you know. But maybe Sorrow to get cleaned up first. Richard will guide you. Good. Then we talk later. I am very glad to meet you. Please. - Thank you. Just relax and have fun. Use what you want. Do not hurry. The food will take a while. Do you eat lamb? I think everything is best. - Enjoy it from your bath. Oh, we thought you might be an aperitif before dinner would. A glass of wine. Yeah, thanks. Is it anything? - Too good for its type. Sorrow. I ask you. It is most suitable? - She is perfect. You are so cunning. I feel like a little girl on Christmas morning. Naughty girls like you then get gifts? Sorrow? I'm going to serve dinner. - I'll be there. Great. I can not wait until you taste it. For what we receive, make us truly grateful. Our thanks to our doors that He Sorrow came. Jesus is a shepherd caring ... even the most stray sheep from his flock guards. This looks delicious. - Hopefully it's nice. I'm not hungry. - Eat what you can. Richard, pour some wine for her. You do not like drinking? - We do not drink. But we are our guests sake. You do not know what you're missing. - You know what, Sorrow? Help yourself but. Tell me, Sorrow. How did you come up on the streets? Trust me to hesitate. I've heard many sad stories ... some rather shocking. - That's true. It grabs Richard sometimes a lot. I admire a man who dares to cry. My father thought him rather a weakling. But men must change with the times. There is not much to tell. Probably. It will give you relief when you can pour your heart. What was it? Drugs? Or a bad dad, who came every night to sneak a quickie? I bet it is. - Naughty girl you are. Take another drink. It rises a little to my head. What gives? You will not just to drink on the streets of this quality. Do you drink a lot, Sorrow? - No ... I prefer to stay clean, you understand. No artificial substances. Clean and pure. Fall guys there also? You know, men. That'm there anywhere you want to stabbing. That certainly often do you get? Tempting as they provide money for the privilege. If you can call it. I have a boyfriend. - Oh yeah? And how are you from? Uncomfortable, as in parks and back alleys. And dirty too. How to become clean again afterwards? What filthy. Someone has too much to drink. - She has barely touched her food. Ungrateful little bitch. You know how long I'm sure uitgesloofd? That was damn time. Richard, discard it and open one that is nothing. I yearn for it. Have fun but then that slut of yours. Why not go on, Richard. Wonderful. You're beautiful. Look what you do to me. You're crazy, right? I notice to you. You little bitch. You beautiful little bitch. You see how wet you are. How good you are. A bitch in heat, are not you more. A lake of perdition. Filth. You deserve it. I saw your face you had a dirty slut that you'd want. You spend your life down by sucking and fucking ... and yet it is not enough. It's never enough. You want more. Always more. Christ ... Wonderful. Look. She tries to sweet things in your ear, Richard. If you're gonna scream, my wife pressed her cigarette out on your eyeball. Got it? Look at that. - That little slettebak enjoy it. I know them to choose or not? Listen to me. I'll rip your dick off and push him down your throat until you choke it. Watch her. What a vuilbekkerij. Rinse out her mouth again, Richard. This child freed from original sin. I baptize you in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Clean burning. Go shower. That gives us the chance to know each other better. Okay. But do not get carried away. I want nothing missed. Hurry up. You will not mind playing with me? I thought so it's just for fun. We work hard for what we have, so we deserve some fun. Because we do useful work. What are you doing? You're scum, nothing. You go through life begging. We take what we rightfully. We do not wait until someone gives us, we have earned. You ... You're disgusting. You're a tough, huh? Since I have respect for. You must also be. I can of myself, but Richard? He is nothing without me. Without me, his mother every evening to massage his back. I have to save myself. You know what I mean. I see it in you. We have much in common, right? Remarkably much in common. You're actually a good girl. You just need to be housebroken. Would you like that? Probably. You want your mommy coach? Look at this. You have to be devoured. You really enjoy, eh? Are you laughing now? Sometimes find this funny? How long we can keep him alive? I do not know. If we keep him drugged and bleeding under control ... a few weeks maybe. Then we have a couple of weeks of fresh, hot meat. For what we receive, make us truly grateful, O Lord. Mechanical Mutants When people touch me, I see things. For example, what they do. So I hit people anymore. There's a man in the sky, but he's not human. What they do to him is ... terrible. But he's dying. He wants to die. I feel his pain. Tell me what you see. We lost him. - Feed him off. Put him with the others. The weather has been to no avail. He was so encouraging. He could not meet the high dose. Not strong enough for transplant. I'll keep looking. There will still be slightly ahead. Hi, Carla. Listen, you know I can not. No, not anymore. Okay. Take care. Who was that? - Sara. They are looking for a babysitter. If you can be there to nine hours ... The hash is Moroccan, very good stuff. But cocaïïne is too much cut, give the regular customers at great speed. Be careful this time. Forward. Same as last time. Is that alright? - Yes, yes, fine. It is not too strong. Enjoy. Please. Agreement. Take it easy. What is happening to you? Did you use? What happened? Why did you take risks? I'm surprised. My bag was stolen. I have a headache, Frank. Do this now? - It is so no longer. It is open every week to touch you. I know you've tried. But it is nothing like that. I just want a painkiller and go to bed, okay? I need the door. Hi, Frank. - Dr. Reece. Fresh? - Very. That is important. We need twice as much. Difficult. - This is a crucial period. We will pay well. Okay, I'll do my best. I can in my profession are resourceful men use. Dr. Reece ... I need to talk to you. It ... It's about my girlfriend. I am a recovering drug addict. I try to get rid of it. It is hard. I manage one week or two to stay clean. Then I have a bad day and ... Frank is a tremendous support. But sometimes ... Sometimes I get such pain from within and it's the only thing that helps. Is that all? I have ... I lived getippeld. How long? - A while. I do not remember exactly. A couple of years. Frank would know. - Were you pimp Frank? He applied to me initially. But when we got some, he was no longer behind. So did you quit? - I did it less often. I went through an agency working. So Frank was not involved. And now? - I'm trying to find a job. But that is not easy. I'll give you some tablets. They are new but promising. They are strong, so keep up the daily dose. And there is a blood test is needed. There may be side effects. Occasional mild hallucinations, sounds, lights, possible headache. Nothing to worry about. But the choice is obviously yours. Jen, when we work together, we can really mean something. You've already been through so much. What do you know Dr. Reece? Do you trust. I'm his cousin. - Nader is my skin, eh? Course in first aid? Beautiful, that you need. You have the night shift. He must now be guarded 24 hours a day. So make sure he does not die. Uncle Reece would not be annoyed. It stinks in there. Not good. Not quite. The Nazis had already discovered that these guys special. Cut them to pieces and transplanted their dick and stuff. Evil mess. They brought them even with regular guys. Sometimes it worked. Than those poor suckers still lived for years. Anyway, the Nazis discovered that this stuff certain characteristics. It healed the other prisoners ... it messed with their minds in a very special way. The field of interest of our Dr Reece. I thought this was all about drugs. That is true. Kind of a damn powerful. One that opens the third eye. You know what that is? The most intense trip that a person can experience and still survive. A whole new level of tripping. It is more addictive than crack ... and wipe your memory clean so that you even forget what day it is. But oblivion is king. Dr Reece long as his money, who cares? Allow them to have health. That I will not stand waiting. It is not a street drug. This will be very exclusive. But now I'm out of here. He is not long. You have to constantly keep in mind. So stay awake and do your job. Call me when a problem occurs. But only a real problem. Holy shit, say. Carla, I told you that I no longer do. He will be satisfied with Paula. How much? Of course I need the money, but no ... No, okay? You okay? Yes. Best. Nothing happened. Cafeïïnevrije organic coffee with milk. I have allergies. What is this? - A guy has this issue. Stupid. No, this dose is not correct. Where's Reece with b. .. Listen. We make the stuff here and send it to you. You send it to the lab. The lab makes tablets. Can you follow me so far? Nice. When you sent it to Reece. Not back here as you continue to do so. Come and get your kidneys before Reece leaves away. Hey, Dr. Reece would like to keep his toys sterilized. He has big plans for our guests and that time comes. I have therefore taken his toys. For some reason this keeps him going. Hold this for a while. Wake up. Brave lad. Here we go. That has always followed. Cool. Why that light before his eyes? - Nothing 'his'. It is not human. That load it up, makes it not fall asleep. Keeps neurons active. That's it. Are you okay? Yes. What time is it? Nearly eight hours. You were deeply sail tonight. I have one of those new pills. Strange dreams. Must have been a salutary nap. Your eye looks better. I need to arrange a few things. During the afternoon I am home. Let's pick an evening meal, right? Did you like that, huh? Who needs to shake your cage? You were out cold. I do not pay as much for a bag of potatoes to sew. I'm sorry. - Here I call the agency. I'll give you half, okay? Damn booze barge. I felt better for a while the pills. But now I get headaches and weird white flashes before my eyes. Anything else? How strange, too. I see a man hanging in a cage. It's like I can feel how he feels. He wants to die. These hallucinations are normal. Your body gets used to the medicine yet. You should watch your health. How do you go? Well ... Good. I have worked again. - Need a job? For my old desk. They kept calling. Why did you do? The money? - Yes. No ... Previously for drug money. But now ... I can not explain. I feel a ... desire for sex but not in a normal way. It's like I'm constantly hungry. And yet I feel good. I am so confused. - I am just trying to understand. How would you do that? I can not even understand. - Of course. Hi, Frank. Yes, the previous delivery was fine. Very fresh. They are really different donors? Very nice. I am calling about Jennifer. It is very important that they keep taking the tablets. She comes at a critical phase of her treatment. They may behave strangely. Distant. This is normal. You touch her, she can withdraw. It is hypersensitive. Let me know if she seems to feel unwell. I'm worried about her, she has endured much. Honey? Okay? - I'm tired, I have a headache. Where have you been? - I was on stage. Looking like this? So dressed up? - Fuck you, Frank. I had a job interview. You had not told. - So? Here you'll get a headache. According to Dr. Reece is just a side effect. I feel way better already. You will work for the agency? - Stop it. Answer. - I knew you did not previously? I said I had a headache, leave me the hell alone. Let me go. - First answer. Go ahead. - You think I do not? Why should you be different than the rest? Weak. That was always al - Do not. It can not care. - That's not true. For you march was allowed. - There is the ecessary changes. We're together now. It's fine. You do not have to do. What is it? - Oh, god ... Stay away from me, Frank. Do not come near me. Here we go. Your favorite time of day. Michael? - Yes. And you Karen? Yeah, come on. - Thank you. Make it simple. Oh, I need some "Bolivian marching powder" brought. Can I tempt you? Great idea. I just came from a conversation. I got the promotion on. And it's my birthday, so I thought ... Can me. I go into town and treat myself to a nice lady. I am not a heavy user, more an occasional lover. My first time at this office. Nice guys, I guess. Yes, they are best suited. Oh, God ... Holy shit. Oh, Christ ... Oh, damn ... Where have you been? Jen? Jen, what ... Please say something, sweetie. I'm not angry, I just want to help. Jen, please be open. Let me help you. I agree. Frank. You Frankie ... Christ, why can I not help you. Jen, open the door. Fucking door. Oh, shit. - Hold him now, but under control. Pick up the cattle prod. I'm with you, honey. I'm with you, hold on. I'll come help. Listen, that you have outbreaks. I will get you salt water. I'll get some drinks for you. Perseverance. Dr. Reece, Frank. No, please. Listen, you must come. It's Jen. She has already taken the pills from you. Your uncle will flip when he hears this. You tell him. Is it to her again? Yes, thank you. I can not thank you enough. If they but out of danger. When can I see her? That would be great. Yes, here they are. Should I bring anything? Okay, I gotta go. Thank you, Dr. Reece. It's excellent. She is ... Of course. It was ... It was no trouble. Yes. I will do, Dr. Reece. It is hard. I manage one week or two to stay clean. Then I have a bad day and ... Frank is a tremendous support. But sometimes ... Sometimes I get such pain from within and it's the only thing that helps. Sometimes I feel trapped. In a trap made by myself. I need a way out. I need a fresh start. Very different. But how do I go about it? How do I go about that, doctor? Can you help me? Carrion Rumlet & Baker, hello. Rumlet & Baker, hello. Rumlet & Baker, hello. Rumlet & Baker, hello. What is it? - Hello. Do you eat without me? - I did not know what time you'd be there. Get me ready for what? - Can not you make some for yourself? I've worked hard all day. First let me eat it here. I'm not as dumb a Snork stand idle. Then go watch TV. - I will not, I'm hungry. Well, then ... You can share this with me. - I'm nothing with you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Pete. I'm not in the mood, Claire. - You do not know where I want. Not in there. I do not feel, I said. Please ... Why do not we just go to the bedroom? Keep your hands off me. Claire find sexy? - What is that supposed to be a question? Well? - That I can not answer. Why? I ask you do yourself. - No, because I can not win. If I say yes, I your horny girlfriend. If I say no, I insult you indirectly. It is never good. No, I want to know. Do you find her sexy? Since I can not answer, I said. I can not win. Bullshit. Just say yes or no. Is she sexy or not? You're an idiot, you know? Ready? - You went out with Al anyway? Yes, but you had objected to, so it's off. Go along with you, see you at home though. - He's gone. Call him. - What about you? I go with the band. They took me to a party afterwards invited. Can I come? - Call him before he reached the subway. He has always felt like in beer. You're better without me entertained. Jesus Christ. Fucking bastards. Stand up. Little brat. You dirty, dirty bastard. Put on your mask. Put that damn mask. You're good for nothing. Hurry. Disgusting man. Follow me. Come see what you did. You're disgusting. Come on. Look what you did. Do not piss in my ondergoedla, do you understand? Otherwise, angry mom. And you do not want, do you? Put your face in it. I am not you. Bloody idiot. What is it? - I did not expect that you would come. Why not? - You made it late? I was early to the laundry. How was your day? Quite relaxed. - That's good. The usual, and a gin and tonic for Lucy. You must pay this time. - I have 50 pounds until next week. Jill is on the warpath. Maybe in a few weeks back, not now. That is 6.25. - Thank you, darling. Do not do that again, Claire. I need the money now needed. I mean it. - I'll pay you later. No, you pay me now. That is 6.25. I give it up at home though. - You give me the money now ... or I smash your glass with your face and let you bleed to death on the spot. Take one yourself, honey. What are you doing? Please do not. Then at least let me do it. Claire? - Shut up. Should I dress? You can do whatever you want with me. Still, I try to concentrate. Damn. - Do not run away. Pete, let him not touch me. - Do not panic. Claire, turn around. Just turn around. Let's go. Calm down. Let him not come near me, Pete. We have to go through. There is nothing. Keep your head. I got you. - Make ... make sure they leave. I'm with you. Is the weather? Sometimes I think I do not deserve. - Yes, I think sometimes. Brutal flail. Why have not one friend, Al? - I've had Sat. I have never met. - It is always of long duration. Why not? - My dick is too big. Really? - No, I make a joke. He's probably bigger than Pete. - Claire ... Shut up. Yours is cute, but not great. - Keep your head up now? Yes, I saw him. - Fuck up. Watch your words, Peter. Now you have a girlfriend? - At the moment, no. This is unfortunate. - Not really. Want another beer, Al? Thanks. Yes. - Get a few beers, Pete. Do it yourself. - I maintain our guest. Do you get them. I have not yet up. And you've had enough. I asked your opinion? I want another one. - I am not going to get. It's okay ... I do get them. Want another one? Yeah, thanks. - I will show you where they stand. Hello. - Can? Thank you. Your beer, buddy. - Thanks. Al just told me that he never had a threesome. Typically a man. That is your imagination. - Not with another guy. It's give and take. Lucy likes you. I doubt it. - I think they would like. She's not. - I can bring her tomorrow. And we all now? I do not the balls in my face to have. Why would they hang on your face? What a strange comment. Come on, Al. If Pete does not want to do ... Put in another joint. Are you serious? - Of course. Take as much as you want. Perfect. Pete? What are you doing? - What does it look? I do not get it, Pete. This is ours, I can not share with one another. Maybe with Al. - This is for both of us. It's for you. Let's face it. - But you enjoyed it also. Maybe earlier. I still think it's fine. - That's just it. It was always about you. It was never about us. Come to bed, Pete. I am reading. - Please ... I am reading. - Can you not read in bed? Not really. - Why do you act so? Hello, darling. - Bye, handsome. Long time no see. I know. Would you like to sign here? Where do you want to have?
