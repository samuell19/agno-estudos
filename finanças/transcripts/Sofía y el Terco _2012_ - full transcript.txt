Beach, breeze, sea... don't think about it anymore, come to paradise with El Palmar Tours... Take advantage of our spectacular promotion... The news is about to start... Travel now... What are you waiting for, pack your suitcases... call... Colombians perceive the high cost of food in stores and on occasion eat out... That's why grocery store owners have seen the need to increase the sales promotions. Hell, you look gorgeous! Compadre... And do we know what it's going to be about this time? No idea. MISSING Thanks Mr. Alfredo You're definitely never going to learn... See how it improves? Bam Bam here baby Bam Bam, shake it, Come! If you'll allow me I'll wet you, I'll make it red, I'll slowly touch with that loose bikini Let's go to the beach where I'll pay for everything, let's go without friends, just you and me. So let's go to the beach, and I'll come get you, Put on the loose bikini that I'm going to take off Your feet and your legs, I'm going to shave and then... MISSING It was an accident, God's will, don't get all sad on me... Look, I was the one who wanted to go the most... besides, the trip is not cancelled, it's just postponed for a bit until the kid can take care of the business by himself. Do you agree? Sofia, are you listening to me? No! No! No! Sofi! Old folks like us can't make long term plans, what we have the least of is time... Or is it that Alfredo is going to die because that shack is shut down for a week? Oh? Or are you going to go broke because you don't open every darn day, every darn week, of every darn month of the year? No! Sofi, you're plain dumb... how many years has Alfredo been making up some excuse to cancel the trip to the sea.. No! No! No! Don't you dare give me the same story again... I know that Alfredo is a good husband, but he's too cautious and stubborn. So much so... that he chews five times more than any human being, before he swallows. Did something happen? No, sir. This time it is different because the trip was just postponed. Excuse me. Flake! Dummy! No, Sofi, your husband turned out just like my Alberto may he rest in peace. His entire life working like a mule... Not capable of ever indulging in anything... What for? To end up here? No... Oh I didn't bring anything to cut this with. I'm going to go find something. Mr. Alfredo... I wanted to tell you something... Tell me. Let's see, Mr. Alfredo, it's that I... hmm, it's that, considering that what happened to my hand is nothing serious, well I, how can I say it... What's happened is, the hand doesn't hurt me anymore at all, right? So I was thinking that... if you and the missus still have plans for your vacations trip, well I can stay here... Put on the brakes, kid. You're talking without thinking. If you get tangled up with everything that has to be done around here, when you're all whole, imagine how it would be now that you're half of what you usually are!!! This is no big deal, Mr. Alfredo, look I can put... Enough! There's no substitute for experience. Do you realize what you're proposing? That we go, both of us, alone? You've gone mad? Right Sofia? Do you want to have a cup of coffee? I'll make it right away... All right! We'll do it, but under one condition: It has to be a secret because I don't want Alfredo to find out and make you feel guilty and then everything will be spoiled. Approved. And for it to be secret we have to make up a secret escape route. I knew that one day I would find use for this. Ready. OK. Let's see how much we have spent up to now. What does it say here? Wait, wait... Oh! I pushed the wrong button. Oh, Sofia... we're going to have to go back to... Sofi? Sofia? Let's go Mercedes!!! Ok! The forest of the headless Priest... If we want to carry out this plan, we have to cross right through there... But not today. We'll cross it when we have to cross it... Thank you. See you later. - Who is it? - Manuel Ricardo? No! Don't shut me out Manuel Ricardo, please don't shut me out!!! Get out of here! Please, I just want to talk to you... I don't want to see you woman!!! Is it that you're never going to forgive me? I just want to forget you Maria de los Angeles... It's so hard for you to understand it, but I... in the acquired lands there would be streams acres of natural forests, lagoons and water springs. This does not exist in the national and international markets. And let's say that the sales of oxygen are being formalized. We can't pass out there. No! Wait! Do you think she is capable of keeping our secret? Do you remember if I turned the stove off? I could have sworn that I left it on. But, oh well, these things can happen to anyone... and it's better to make sure because otherwise you can't travel in peace... Should we have some coffee? We'll leave tomorrow. We'll leave tomorrow. Oh, a cigarette... Where are my cigarettes? Sofi... Sofi... Perpetual light shine upon her. May she rest in peace. Perpetual light shine upon her... Do you want to be alone, dear? Beach, breeze, sea... don't think about it anymore, come to paradise with El Palmar Tours... Take advantage of our spectacular promotion... Travel now, two for one, very economic What are you waiting for? Pack your suitcases! Call 333-5522... Then? Should I erase it and star over? Well, no, I'm not going that way. But, I can leave you here, and there you can take a bus, that can take you where you're going. What do you say? OK, we're leaving! OK. We'll talk later. Sofia? Sofia!!! INSTRUCTIONS FOR EVERYTHING Instructions of how to prepare frozen food. Instructions of how to pick everyday clothes. Instructions of how to feed the birds. WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY. You don't like to talk a lot, right? Do you know how I realized it? Well it's that I know how to read people. For example, I see someone and right away I know who that person is, what he or she is like, what he or she likes... What's more, I've gone so far as to get right their zodiac sign. It's clear that you're a Gemini, right? You sure are. There are people that really talk too much, right? What do you say about attorneys for example? Those attorneys that are always talking of the norms, the decrees... I don't know what about the law... Or the hairdressers... those are talkers... That's why I don't go much to the hair salon. Or cooks, cooks talking about their recipes, Asia this or that... Or what about laborers... it's that this broke, and the pipe opened up over there... and then we have to open up over here... No, no, no, that's talking and talking, let's see.. And how about mechanics? That's why I fix-up my own car. I don't take it to the shop... And that's why I don't like... people who talk just for the sake of talking. I like people like you, or like me... I like singing more than talking... Little Creole road so flowery and sunny, with a lined handkerchief you saw me pass through. While friendly pastures that know of my longing, like sweet relief, that greenest of greetings I did get. Crossing mountains and valleys, as with wings rode my poor wagon, with its cargo of hopes its wheels let it dribble the wind... And when it crossed the depth of the valley a slow current... OK, lady, you'll have to excuse me because I have to make a technical... stop. I won't be long. When time stopped going by for me... when the sun finally set for you... when I finally understood that this is over... You went by and I saw you, you were another color... What are you doing here? Please don't tell anyone that I'm here and... let me continue being... missing. Yellow memories... that come back, when I feel cold... I miss you more if I don't see you shine... I'll wait for you, behind the window... When time came back, it counted the seconds, when the sun hid in this bedroom... Mr. Alfredo! Goodness, be careful not to kill yourself! I was worried that maybe something had happened to you! - To me? - Yes. No! What happens is... oh! Adult stuff that you don't understand. Juice? We're going to make a stop for dinner. No one can stay in the bus. I'm coming! I'm coming! Let's go let's go ladies and gentlemen! Hurry up, let's get out, Puerto Burro this way! Hello? Hello? Sofia? Sofia Those who are going to Loma Linda this way... Let's go, let's go... We're leaving, we're leaving, we're leaving... The police are also reporting restricted transit in 263 roads, most of them state and local... the worst one the way to the coast... That's how we treat potheads in this town! Well, I think you're going to have to relax, because things are going to get quite difficult today... My town. My town is the best thing for what you are looking for. I'm going over there, why don't you come with me, uh? Do you have any change so we can catch a bus? No? That's alright, we'll come up with something to get there... Bam Bam take it baby Bam Bam, move the dial, shake it momma, Bam Bam, take it baby Bam Bam, move the dial, show off momma... If you'll allow me I'll wet you, I'll make it red, I'll slowly touch with that loose bikini, Let's go to the beach where I'll pay for everything, let's go without friends, just you and me. So let's go to the beach where I'll wet you, put on your bikini that I'm going to take off, your feet and your legs I'm going to shave and then I'm going to have a taste, bring your sunglasses, you look real bad, you have the bucket and I have the shovel, we'll do it on the beach on top of a towel, you look at me I look at you, evil looks. Take off your jeans, I'll take you to my boat to listen to reggaet√≥n. Look, I want you to know that I'm an honest person, you hear me? Not a thief or anything similar. I do like a little marijuana from time to time, but nothing else! Hmm? I'm not hurting anyone with this. Mr. Alfredo... Yes? Your... your buttons... How about that...? Wake up, Sofia, wake up! Jump in there momma, that's what's up, rhythm bye bye, mount my style Navigating until we reach and find and shake the random waves, This is where it is in our interests to make you wet, The breeze holds me, just show off and renew yourself... Beautiful, swimming on by, comes floating directly my way... Let's make love, you're going to get wet, you have no way out... Well, and you're not going to talk about your trip? Tell me all about it! I leave this city, and I look back at things, they could all celebrate that I'm not working again you saw I was not doing well, I was never going to finish, now I'm going to sing until my time runs out and my destiny will be to travel without a body, without a stirrup and not have my breath sucked out of me... River boat and more to myself... I have to thank you, I had a great time with you, I saw you grow when you saw me grow... we stood on our feet, played games until ten, we saw the sunrise and nothing will happen for a while... And my destiny is to travel through time, without a stirrup, and not have my breath sucked out of me... towards the void without open eyes, Riverboat...
