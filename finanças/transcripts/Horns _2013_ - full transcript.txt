The only thing that mattered was her. She was my Garden of Eden, and God knows how beautiful it was until that night. No, no one is born evil, the Devil himself was a fallen angel. But sometimes, when you go through hell, the only way out is to walk deeper into the fire. Are you horny? Yeah, I'm getting warmer. Oh, fine! - No. - Yes. I'm gonna love you for the rest of my life. Just love me for the rest of mine. ♪ I ♪ ♪ I wish you could swim ♪ ♪ Like the dolphins ♪ ♪ Like dolphins can swim ♪ ♪ Though nothing ♪ ♪ Nothing will keep us together ♪ ♪ We can beat them ♪ ♪ Forever and ever ♪ ♪ Oh we can be heroes... ♪ Hey, Ig, what does it feel like to get away with murder? Want to comment on the fire at the lab in Tacoma last night? Have you heard that the police have a new witness? You should ask God to save your soul for what you did to her! I should ask the Devil to punish whoever the fuck killed her. Hi, this is Lee, please leave a message. Hi, Lee, umm... please, can you meet me at my parents' house in half an hour. I really need to talk to you. Start picking up the phone, man, come on. Are you proud of me, mom? I'm so famous, people follow me everywhere I go. Come inside, sweetie. You just can't talk to those reporters. They'll take whatever you say and just twist it around. But if I don't talk to them, it looks like I have something to hide, right? How's Lee working out for you? I mean, you still think he's up to the job? Yes, he's keeping me out of jail, at least for the time being, that's some kind of triumph. Look, I know he's an old friend of yours but you don't have to settle for a public defender. I've got the money, I will hire you the best lawyer in Seattle. Every other lawyer we talked to wanted me to take a plea. Lee is the only one who believes I'm innocent. Just don't talk to any more reporters, please. And don't admit anything. I don't have anything to admit to, dad. Look, honey, We don't care what happened. You're our son. That's all that matters. - Oh, Sit back down, Ig. - If you think for a second that I might've killed her, then why are you protecting me? Because if I did anything to her, I'm a fucking monster. I got to go. Ig, look, I, uh... I don't have to go back on the road next week if you don't want me to. You got to earn a living. I'll sort things out. Except I need you to stay, Terry. The whole family needs to put up a united front for Ig. Hey, buddy, - how is it going? - Lee. Lee, if you want some food, we've got lots of leftovers from lunch. I grabbed something on the way, thank you. - How are you guys doing? - Yeah... umm, Lee, what happened at the lab in Tacoma? One of the reporters this morning told me it burned down. Yeah, all the samples from Merrin's body were destroyed. ??? couldn't recover and blood or DNA at this point. That, that's a fucking disaster for us, right? That means there's no evidence anybody else killed her. It's not ideal, but there's no need to panic at this point. And who... who is this new witness? What is that? I'm trying to figure that out today and I'm also gonna get your confession to the police thrown out. Yeah, good. You know I never confessed to them. They're just looking for any way to put me away for the rest of my life. It's okay, Lee can fix anything, right? We'll see about that but you know, you don't have to convince me. Ig, I believe you. You don't think I'm capable of murder? Just put me in a room with the guy who really killed her. Little early for you to start drinking, ain't it? They put me on leave at the station. Apparently, most commuters don't like it when their DJ is a murder suspect. Yeah, so maybe you should take your business elsewhere. No offense, but you make the other customers uncomfortable. You're telling me I make these guys feel uncomfortable? Alright, come on, Iggy deserves a drink as much as anybody. Thank you. More than anybody. Sorry you've to... stand up for me all the time, now that I'm all grown up. Listen, if you're looking for a friendlier place to grab a drink. - I get off at five. - Um... I appreciate... the offer but I... probably better off... like, drinking alone. Thank you all for coming tonight to pay tribute to our dear girl Merrin. I know that Dale would like to say a few words to welcome you. Well, uh... It's, uh... it's real good to see you all here. The truth is I haven't felt much like... getting out of bed in the morning since Merrin... Ig Perrish, he murdered her and he's still walking the streets. I treated him like a son practically all his life, and then he killed my little... ...my little girl. As long as he's free, there's no way that her soul can be laid to rest. So let us all bow our heads in prayer. - Thank you for coming. - Thank you, everybody. - Christ, Ig! - Leave me alone, - Glenna. - What are you thinking, coming out here? They could've seen you. She went to church every fucking Sunday! She wore a cross around her neck, and did it make any difference? No! God turned a blind eye and let her die out here alone and afraid. - Come on, oh come on, Ig. - Fuck God! For whatever reason in this crazy fucked up world, I was being punished. When they looked at me, they saw a devil and maybe I did too. And now I had to look apart. What... Ah! Jesus! Ha! Ha! Ha... Let me have him. Send him now! Give him to me now! You were in the bathroom for a long time. Are you still drunk? How do I look? Did you notice anything, unusual? You mean the horns? Shit, so they're real? Fuck! Ig... Can I... Can I have another donut? Why are you asking me? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. You think I'll be OK if I eat 6 more donuts? Yeah, do whatever you like. Thank you. I don't like it. My stomach hurts. Should I have another one? Why would you have another one if your stomach hurts, Glenna? Because I want to get really fat. I'm worthless anyways. Nobody will... screw me without being totally drunk. Everybody in this town thinks that I'm trash. Come on, Glenna, that's not true. You wouldn't have screwed me if you weren't blind drunk. - Well... - And I know you were thinking about Merrin the whole time. Glenna, I'm sorry, I've no excuse for last night. I just need to know if I can eat the rest of this box? Yeah, go ahead, pig it out. Uh... I think I... I'm just gonna go, Glenna. - Yeah, thank you. Alright. - Hi. - What can I do for you? I need Dr. Renald now to look at... something. Well, that sure doesn't look right. We're gonna need you to fill out some forms. You know, for what it's worth, I'd like to kick my daughter right in her spoiled ass. - Do you think I should? - No, of course not. Why would you even ask me that? Maybe I should just... leave her here and drive away, divorce my husband. Ah... I could fuck my golf pro again. Excuse me? I've never been with a jigaboo before. But it's true what they say about black cocks. I call it my five-iron. Here you go. I feel like I have to yell at that girl's mother. I know it's not her fault that her daughter is a screechy puke, but really, now. Go ahead, why not? Ma'am? Do you think you could show some fucking consideration and take your daughter out of here so that we don't have to listen to her screaming? What did you just said to me? I said you should take that shrieking pig of yours by the hair and drag her the fuck out of here! Fuck you! Shut the hell up, you dried-up old twat! Hey, you don't want to do this in front of your daughter, come on! I hate Mommy. I want to burn her in her bed with matches. I want to burn her all up gone! You may want to stop pumping that now? Sorry. My boyfriend is seeing this girl on the side. She works at the Bradly's down by the Marina. I'm thinking on my lunch break, I should drive over there and key her Saab and put dog shit on the driver's seat. Or maybe I should just take a dump on the seat myself. Ignatius Perrish. Long time no see. - Hey. - So, what brings you in here this morning? Well, can you see anything that might be wrong with me? You mean besides your horns? No, that's exactly what I mean. So you can see them? Shouldn't you both be shocked or something? I think if I saw someone with horns, I'd piss down my leg. Well, they're kind of hard to remember. I mean, every time I look away from you for a second, I kind of forget that you even have them. OK... but what are they? Do you think... Could they be cancerous? Could they be some weird tumor or something? Well... they're definitely cause for concern. They look inflamed. Do they hurt? Yes, like hell. Ah! Shit! Um... all right. - You know how I think we should proceed? - How? I think I should grind me up some Oxycontin and have a little snort. I mean I can share, we could get fucked up together. No! Please, can you just focus on my problem for a second? OK, I'm gonna try... but it's hard. I keep thinking about this girl, Nancy. - Oh, God! - That my daughter hangs out with. God, I want her ass so bad. Christ's, can you... how are we going to deal with these things on my head? You fucking patients. All you care about is yourselves! Listen, Doctor, just saw the goddamn horns off. Um... you're sure this is gonna work, right? Uh... not at all, actually, - but it'll be fun to try. - What? Now, just breathe normally. - No, doctor, please... - Shh... If you're not sure, we can just, uh... - It will be okay. Just breathe, just breathe... Everything's gonna be fine. That's right. Have you seen that girl before? What is she doing? I think it's Morse code, just telling you to stop looking at her legs or she'll give you a black eye. Go forth in peace. - Here we go! - Go! Go! Go! Yeah, spread its legs. - Put them in one by one, guys. - I'm telling you, she was doing Morse code. She was sending me a message. - I didn't think you even liked girls, Ig. Always thought you were a fag. - Shut up, Meatbag. - What's so special about her? I mean it's like you all never saw a girl before. You guys are gonna want to find cover or else you'll all be wearing turkey dinner. What's wrong? Shit. Ah... maybe it got wet. Gimme the lighter. Sometimes it messes up. Now, you're literally meatbag! - So, what are we gonna blow up now? - We're not blowing up anything else today. I'm saving my last cherry for something special. Come on, Eric, don't be a dick. The only way I'm giving up this cherry bomb is if one of you homos climbs in that shopping cart and rides it down the log ramp. - I'll do it, Meatbag. - Naked. I'm gonna to do it, Eric. Sure, you are. Ig, don't, don't! Don't be ridiculous, you don't have to do this. You'll get a cherry. Come on, now. Watch out. Don't do this, please. You're gonna kill yourself. Dude, if you get hurt, mom is gonna fucking me! Shit! Ig! Ig! Oh my God, he's gonna get stuck under the logs! Do something, do something! What... he should be up by now. Oh my God! Ig! Ig! Hey, Terry, your brother here is a total fucking lunatic. You fucking idiot! If Lee hadn't been here to pull you out... Did you do mouth to mouth, faggot? - Shut up. - Now give me the cherry. - No way. I said ride down naked. You wore tighty-whities and sneakers. Eric, give him the fucking cherry. So... you like that new girl in church? - I don't know her yet. - I like her too. She's not like all the other girls around here. She's not like Glenna. She gives hand jobs to her brother Eric because she thinks that's the only way guys will like her but they just think she's trash. Maybe I should give her the cross. I mean, I'm the one who fixed it. No! You can't do that. OK, what will you give me for it? Do you want my cherry bomb? You fixed my cross? Yeah. Did something... ...you know, happen to your mom? She died last year, - that's why my dad and I moved here. - Really? How did she... She had cancer. Is it okay if we don't talk about it anymore? Yeah, yeah I understand. Thanks again for... fixing my cross. Ig! Did you give... - ...the cherry bomb to Lee? - What happened? - It blew up in his hands! - What? Where is he? He's in that room. Hey, look at the bright side, I still got eight fingers. I'm sorry. I wish I never gave you... You're not going to tell your mom who gave you the cherry bomb, right? Don't worry about it. Everything is gonna be fine. I'm glad one good thing happened today. - Where are you taking me? - Come on. Can't wait to show you. Come on, come on, come on! Don't fall off. Come on, come on! Don't trip on any roots, OK? Are you sure you know where you're going? - See? - Wow. How did you find this place? Just walking through the woods one day. Come on. This is where I come when I want to be alone. So now I'll know where to find you. We got a great hiding spot where we can hide food, blankets, anything else you want to hide. - So you're a Bowie fan too. - Yeah. I didn't tell you the truth. Lee's the one who fixed your cross. He wanted to give it back to you, but I... traded him the cherry bomb instead. So it's all my fault. How is it your fault? Because if he gave it back to you, then he would've been the one who... You think you traded me for the cherry bomb? You think that's how things work? I left it there for you. It wasn't an accident. I... I wanted you to find it and give it back to me. I wanted to give it to the one who...

We asked you if we could have sex instead - and you said it was okay. - How could I possibly say it was okay? - I was under anesthesia! - You sort of nodded your head, Father Mould? Get away from me. Leave me alone. No, no, no... I'm not here to hurt you. Please, tell me what can I do to stop this? How can I make them go away? You killed that innocent girl, Merrin. There's nothing I can do. So please, leave me alone! - I didn't kill her, father, and now people are telling me all these things I don't want to hear. There must be some prayers you can say? I'll try anything. - You did this to yourself. - What? - You turned away from God. You cast yourself into the darkness. - But I didn't do anything wrong! - Every devil used to be an angel and now you've fallen from grace, forever. When Satan was banished from Heaven, he was cursed to crawl the earth like a snake! There's no hope for you. What? So, that's it? There's nothing you can do for me? I've got a rope in that shed over there. I can take you out to that tree where Merrin died and I... I can string you up. Unless you'd like to do the decent thing and hang yourself. What do you say? Lee. Everyone in this town is going fucking crazy. The town's always been crazy. I think it's because of me and these god dam horns. Yeah. The what? The horns. These horns. What are you talking about? Wait, can't you see them? Are you high right now? Have you been hanging out with Terry? So maybe... Maybe the horns just don't work on good people. You've been under an inhuman amount of stress recently. And maybe you're just starting to go a little, you know... a little cuckoo. And if I'm this crazy and I can imagine all this, then I could easily have got so drunk that I blacked out that night and killed Merrin and just forgot all about it, right? Mom? Mom? Why, I didn't know you were coming. I didn't know where else to go, mom. Something really bad is happening to me. Oh, sweetheart, why couldn't you go somewhere else? What? What do you mean? I don't want to hear about all your problems. - I don't want to know. - Mom. Sometimes, when you talk, I just want to sing. ♪ La la la la la ♪ What are you doing? Mom? I want to hold my breath until you just go away! Jesus Christ, mom, don't... don't... Stop it! I'm gonna write you a letter... a really nice letter about how much dad and I love you, and how great it would be for both of us if you would, just go! But where? Where can I go? I don't know. Didn't you always want to go hiking in Alaska? Didn't you want to go to Vietnam to teach English? Those were things Merrin and I were going to do together, you know that. I don't care where you go just as long as I don't have to see you. Because every time I see you, it just makes me so... unhappy. I just want to be happy again, sweetheart. Oh, I understand. And I don't want you to be my son anymore. Oh. Are you going to go away? Ig. I thought I heard you coming. Yeah, OK, let me... walk you through this, dad. This is the part where you tell me something awful you've been keeping to yourself. Just say it and we'll get it out of the way. I don't know why you turned out like this. With your brother, it's easier. We can always just play music together. But with you, I never know what to say to you. Well, that's not bad, all things considered. I think about Merrin. What a beautiful girl she was. I loved her, you know, in a way. I envied you. I was never in love with anyone the way you two were in love with each other. You couldn't hear her laugh without smiling. It was like music. And when I think about what you did to her... And you never thought, maybe, just maybe, that I didn't do it? Of course not. You're trying to get away with murder. And the worst part is, I'm helping you do it! What? What do you mean by that? I went to call to the guy who runs the state's forensics lab. Dad, are you telling me you got your friend to set that fire to the lab? When the world comes for my son with the knives out, it's my job to stand in the way! Dad, the evidence you got burnt up could've saved me! How could you do it? She was one of the best people I ever knew! She was my favorite thing about you. Yeah, me too. So if you knew how much I loved her, then how could you ever believe I'd kill her? Isn't that why you killed her? Because you loved her so much and you lost her. Way more people kill out of love than out of hate. What's going on, Ig? Did you go home like I asked you to? Yeah, I did that and it was very enlightening. Did you know that my dad got his friend to start the fire in the lab? Uh... Hypothetically, if I did know, I would legally be required to tell the police. But maybe the fire was a blessing in disguise. How? How was it a fucking blessing? If the lab hadn't burned down, that evidence would've cleared me, Lee! OK, I know it's rough for you staying at your house, so why don't you just take the keys to my place, you can crash on the couch. No, I'm fine. I actually got a lot to do. I got to figure out who really killed Merrin - and get him to confess. - How are you planning to do? Lately, I can be pretty fucking persuasive. Hey, Ig, nice look for you. Showing your true nature? You know, I'd really appreciate it if you guys would fuck off. Come on, Ig, admit you killed her, it'd be such a huge scoop for me. Oh, good to know your journalistic integrity is fucking unimpeachable. Hey, if you confess to me, I could get you out of the stupid local news. - You know what, I got an idea. How about you guys beat the shit out of each other and the winner gets an exclusive interview with me. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! I thought I told you I don't want you coming around here no more, Ig. Jesus Christ! Al, you don't want to do that, you'll get arrested. I don't give a flying fuck if I get arrested. Why don't you just get me a whiskey? You know you want the money. What I really want... is to burn this place down and collect the insurance. - Look, can you not burn down the bar right now? I need your help for something. If anyone knows anything about who killed Merrin, you're gonna have to tell me now. The only thing I ever killed was a couple of dogs. I run a dog-fighting ring out of the supply room back there. - Jesus, Al, I don't want to know that. I've been unemployed for three months and I hate my life, so, Yeah, I can sure understand wanting to kill someone. Rob, that's not what I meant. I really want to show everybody my dick. Oh, don't! I want that all the time. - I want that all the time. - The only thing I know, is that I got a cousin who's a cop and he knows who the new witness is. This waitress who served you the night Merrin got killed says she saw you drive back to the restaurant and drag Merrin into your car. Thanks a lot, Stan. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Hey, my interview? Hey, my interview? OK. OK, guys, so, uh, you're gonna come tomorrow night to the diner at about nine? I'd hopefully have done the deed by then - and then we can go out celebrate. - Fuck, yeah. You want me to bring any goodies? No. I think me and Merrin are going to be happy enough tomorrow without stimulants, I hope. Yeah, well, I'm a musician and we always need stimulants. - I can understand that. - And I'm a state employee, subject of random drug testing. Sure you're not rushing into this? Rushing into it? Dude, how am I rushing into it? We've been going out since we were kids. - Hi. - Hey. Hey. Oh, is everything all right? Hey, what's wrong, Merrin? I, um, really don't know how to say this, so I'm just gonna go ahead and say it. I'm moving to Los Angeles. You think? That's great! I can get a leave of absence from the radio station easy. I want a change of scene too. That's not what I'm talking about. I think we need to stop seeing each other. - Hey, lovers! You guys, uh ready to order? - What? Oh, I don't think we're quite decided yet. OK, I'll come back. I don't understand. I thought everything was going great. It's just we've never had a chance to be apart. I've never had a chance to think about what I want for my life. OK, but I know what I want. I want the life we've been dreaming about since we were kids. That's the problem. We've been dreaming about that since we were kids. And we're adults now and we need to start being practical. I don't know what you mean by that. I don't want to ever be the reason for any of your regrets, - Ig. - How many times have we talked about getting married? I mean how many time have we talked what we're gonna name our kids? - I'm not even sure if I want to have kids. What? You sounded pretty into it the last 8000 times we talked about it! How many girls have you been with? You know the answer to that. - Just me. - Yeah. No one does that, Ig. No one on the whole planet does that. You need to see other people so that you can figure out if I am the one that you want to be with. I don't want to see other people! Is that what you want? Are you in love with somebody else? How far has it gone? Answer me! How far has it gone? Have you fucked him already? Please, Ig. No, tell me. Tell me everything that happened! I need to know. Have you fucked him already? - Why are you asking me this? - Because I want to know. I want to know everything. It'll make it easier for me to hate you! You deserve better. Finally, something we agree on. Please, I'm gonna be lost. I'm not in love with you anymore. Come on, please. We're not done talking about this. Please, Ig... please. - Yeah, what are you looking at? - Sir! Sir! Sir! We gonna have to ask you and your wife to leave. She's not my wife. - She's just someone I used to fuck! - Hey! Easy! Hey, Ig, whoa, how'd it go? You already proposed? - The party's over, Terry. Go home. - What the hell are you talking about? Hey, hey, I thought we were going to celebrate tonight. What's going on? Ig, what the fuck are you doing? Ig! Merrin, you all right? Morning, Ig. Roll down the window so we can talk? Hey, Meatbag, what's up? When was the last time you saw Merrin, Ig? What's happened to her, Eric? What makes you think something happened to her? Oh fuck, it's all my fault. Anything that happened to her, it's all my fucking fault. Oh, I gotta go. You can sit wherever you want. Oh wait, you're that guy. Ig Perrish. Yeah. I heard you've been telling lies about me to the police. Yeah, I have. And you know, I don't even feel a little bit bad about it. - You want to tell me exactly - what you said to them? - Oh, I told them that your girlfriend forgot her jacket, so I followed her to the parking lot and I saw you drive back and scream - that you were gonna kill her. - But you know that's not true! And that I saw you drag her into your car and you drove off. Why the hell would you say all that? Because I want to be in all newspapers and on TV! I want to be the star witness at your trial. I'm pretty enough to be on TV, right? Especially if I get my tits lifted the way I want. You're just a fucking crazy liar! I know I am. I'm so bad. I'm bad. Sometimes when people ask me what you did, I said that after you beat her brains in, then you turned her over and you fucked her in the ass. You should see their faces when I say that. Everyone loves a good sex murder. You're insane! My brother was here that night and he saw me leave alone. I'm gonna release my own sex-tape and I'm gonna be on reality show. I'll be in US magazine, smiling. Hey, Glenna! - How's it going? - Oh, how do you think it's going? It's going... worse than that. - You alright? - Oh, excuse me. I think I had too many donuts this morning. Yeah, you did. I was there. Oh, you mean last night? No, this morning. You don't remember any of that? Wow, no. I must've been really drunk, so... Why don't you let me suck your cock in the men's room? I'd really like that. And I bet it'd make you feel better. No, Glenna. Thanks, but not right now. The thing is, Ig, I've always... been in love with you since we were kids. But I guess you know that, right? I guess I did kind of know that, yeah. Sorry. I just wish that I could leave this town and... What's stopping you? - You! - Me? No, it can't be me. Right? No! Put this shit whole town in your rear-view mirror and do something good for yourself. Hey, go! Ig, I didn't know you were here. Jesus Christ, what the fuck is on your head? They're horns, crazy story. - Listen, Terry. I need you to help me. - No. Listen to me, Terry. The waitress from the diner, OK, she's going to the cops and telling them that she saw me drag Merrin into my car and drive away from the diner that night. I know for a fact that's not true. You know that, and I know that, but how the hell we're gonna prove that? I mean, Merrin left the diner with me that night. What do you mean, she left the diner with you? You told me you never saw her that night at all. I didn't kill her, Ig. I would never hurt her. - What you talking about, Terry? - I was just too scared. Tell me, Terry! So, uh... What just happened with you and Ig? I don't want to talk about it. You sure? I mean you're shaking, look at you, you're a mess. Hey, hey, hey, why don't you take, take one of these? Just take one, they're fine. - Take the edge off. - I don't want pills. I need to feel what I'm feeling tonight. God, you're beautiful. You know that? We need to pull over. I need to get out of the car. Wo, wo, wo, I didn't... Look, it's the end of the world out there. I want to go for a walk! Are you trying to get yourself killed? Hang on! - Thanks for the ride, Terry. - Come back! I'm fine now. I promise, OK? Merrin! Don't be ridiculous, where are you going? I'll wait for you! Fuck... Fuck! Merrin? Merrin! Merrin! Merrin? How could you? What did you do to her? Do you even fucking remember what you did to her? I didn't kill her. I loved Merrin too. Well, if you didn't kill her, then who did? Oh, fuck! We got a call on the radio about some kind of altercation going on out here. We got a pretty good idea who's responsible. Listen, Eric, this is all my fault. Maestro, break time is over. Let's go! Go on back inside, Terry, none of this concerns you. Yeah, go back inside, play a fucking song! You better calm down, Ig, you don't want to be resisting arrest. We'd be inclined to use force. What would you arrest me for? 'Cause I got in a fight with my coward brother. Is that a crime? The thing is, this club is across the county line. Which means we caught you - fleeing jurisdiction. - For God sake, talk about the most obvious kind of trumped-up charge. Go back inside. - Fuck you, Eric. - Fuck me? - Fuck... - I wish we could bring you in for worse. I wish I could plant something on you. Like maybe a piece of her dress. That way I could put you away for good. For God sake, Eric, you've known me for my whole life. You know I'd never hurt her! Bullshit, Ig, you confessed to me. Everyone in town saw you fighting with her the night she was killed! That's not what happened. I said whatever happened to her was my fault because I ran off on her, I left her alone. Whatever that waitress told you is lies! You listen to me, asshole. I'm gonna make sure you get punished for everything you did to her, even if I have - to beat you to death with my own hands. - Do it, beat him to death. That'll give me something to whack off tonight, only I'll be picturing both of you naked. Yeah, I like that. I like to think about you naked too, Sturtz. What the fuck! Lee might have sprung you for now but we're not gonna let you out of our sight. Hey, Meatbag, leave my client alone. Trying to make my life as hard as possible? Lee, I know who the new witness is. It's the waitress from the diner. She's lying about every... - Do I have to keep a leash on you? - And Terry drove away from the diner with Merrin that night. They drove off together in his car. You're saying Terry was the last person to see her alive? Yeah. I don't think he'd do anything to her, but he can't remember anything. Why, why is he confessing to you all of a sudden? - Because of the horns, Lee! - Oh, my God. Ig, I can't talk to you when you're like this. There's no horns. You're going crazy. Go home. Why are you wearing Merrin's cross? It's not Merrin's. It's mine. You think I'm an idiot? You think I don't know what Merrin's cross looks like? Yes, it's hers. She gave it to me. Why would she do that? - Ig... - What? There's things about Merrin you don't know. There's things about Merrin and me that I haven't told you. What are you talking about? I'm sorry, I didn't mean for anything to happen. You're the one... Ig, come on. - You're the reason she was gonna to... leave me. - We didn't want to hurt you. - If you didn't want to hurt me, - you did a fucking lousy job! - Ig, come on. Ig. Ig, I'm sorry. Fuck! - Fuck! - You like that new girl in church? I don't know her yet. Ig, you like her enough to get me to fix her cross. I like her too. She seems, you know, pure. Ha! Ha! Ha! Get the hell off my property. I know I'm the last person you want to see right now, but you're the only person I can ask about this. I got nothing to say to you. I should shoot you right in the heart. No. If you really wanted to kill me, you'd have already done it. I know that. These days, I bring out the worst in people. What I want is for you to tell me the truth about what you did to my daughter - and then I want to kill you. - What I need to know is, did Merrin say anything to you about leaving me, or about being with somebody else? You got some kind of nerve, coming out here and asking me if my daughter was unfaithful to you? Are you out of your goddamn mind? Look, you're the only person she would've told, you're the only one who loved her like I did. Don't you fucking dare say we're the same! When I was watching the cancer devour my wife's insides, the only saving grace was I thought that was the worst thing that'd ever happen to me but boy, was I wrong! Dale, please, you have to believe me, I loved her but now I, I don't know if I really knew who she was. You think there's a chance in hell I'm gonna say one word to you about my daughter? If you're looking for forgiveness or compassion, or understanding, go talk to a goddamn priest! I know you killed her and I hope you die. I hope you die scared and helpless in the dirt, just like my Merrin did. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I shouldn’t have come. Get off my porch or I swear I will shoot you. Fuck this! Fuck. Sometimes God works in mysterious ways. The horns that reveal so much already, now I can use them to find her killer and set things right. See, vanity doesn't pay and it's gonna be a long time for you to even try and look pretty again. You know, you guys really want to stop following me around. Telling us what to do now? No. I mean, wouldn't you rather just suck each other off right here? What the hell makes you say that? Oh, ever since we were kids, I kind of assumed maybe you had to act so tough because you were ashamed of yourself. Was I right? When I was a kid, I used to shoplift gay porno mags from the drug store. When my dad found them under my bed, - he cracked me with his belt. - You see, you both have been brought up to believe it's a sin but it's just being human. That's why I always wanted to be partnered with Eric. I think about him all the time when I'm whacking off. I want to kiss you on the mouth when you talk dirty like that. Have fun, officers. - Oh, Wallace! - Come here. Hey, Terry. Ig. I didn't know you were gonna come by. How's it going? What's that snake - doing around your neck? - I made a new friend. You want a drink? Maybe something a little stronger? No. No, I want to keep my head clear tonight but don't let me stop you. Do as much as you want to do. Jesus Christ, Terry, how many drugs have you been doing lately? If you want to know the truth, I've... I've had a hard time staying sober, you know, ever since Merrin died. I've actually been on kind of a bender myself tonight. I've been having a very good time. That's, uh... that's great. I'm glad to hear that, Ig. Shit, look... I know things have been tough for you lately, OK, but... well, understandably, but I, I just... But here's where the fun ends. This is gonna give me no pleasure at all. What you... what're you talking about? Um... hmm, well... You're my big brother, Terry. I've always depended on you to look out for me. I've always tried to do my best by you, Ig, you know that. Except when you saw Merrin lying under that tree in that dirt. You didn't call an ambulance and you didn't call the cops. You just ran off and left her there. Fuck, Ig, she was already dead, OK? There was nothing I could do, the cops would've thought that I killed her. Even when I got arrested, you didn't go to them and tell them the truth, no. Now, why would you? Why would you do that unless you were guilty? Unless you actually killed her? Because I'm your fucking brother, that's why! You understand, if I... I mean, they would've just thought I was helping you. But you didn't even try to help me! All you wanted to do was save your own skin. You are a selfish motherfucker, Terry and I hate you. You know what? You're so fucking right. You're right, I'm evil and... and you should kill me, Iggy. That's what you should do, you should fucking kill me. That's what I deserve, right? I mean, after what I did, that's what I fucking deserve. The way I see it, I have every right to kill you. But I'm gonna let you live and make you suffer. Why don't you just finish all that off? What, all of it? I think I made myself clear. Now there's nowhere left to run. You're going to see everything she saw and feel what she felt and the worst part is, you're going to live through all of it. Ig... Iggy! Fuck! Iggy! Iggy! Terry... No, no! Terry! Terry! Terry! No! Iggy! Where are you? No! Help! Help me! Stop... Stop! Punishing Terry was the hardest thing I've ever done. But forcing him to face his demon was the only way I could help him. Jesus Christ, Ig, I looked for you everywhere. Go get out of here before I do something we both gonna regret. You got to move pass this. This is not what Merrin wanted. So you're the expert on what Merrin wanted now. I was never going to tell you anything. No. So how long was it going on between you two? - You don't want to know any of that. - No, I need to understand. Just a couple of months. She's moving out to California. We wanted to figure out if it was real before we told you. So when she got killed, did you think it was me? Like did you think that I found out about it, you would lost control? If I thought that you had anything to do with this, I wouldn't be helping you. - OK, I don't want any more of your help. I'm the only one who can help you. I'm gonna prove that waitress was lying and I'm gonna get Terry to confess to the police. Fucking go, Lee, leave me alone and don't fucking touch me! Give me your cross! Oh fuck, no! Are those horns? Damn right they're horns. I'm glad you can finally see them. Now you've to tell me the truth. Merrin's cross can't protect you anymore. Why should I tell you anything? You're not gonna be able to help it. I never meant to kill her. I didn't mean to do it. I loved her just as much as you. I'm the one who fixed her cross. She should've been with me. You sure as shit fooled me. I always thought you spent your whole life trying to be good! - I'm trying to control myself. - But you saved my life when we were kids. You pulled me out of the water right here! You're the only reason I'm alive! That's the stupidest mistake I ever made. I should've let you drown - and I'd be with her now. - That's a fucking lie! Thank you for coming to see me. Listen, I think Ig is going to propose to me. Do you know anything about that? - Maybe. - There are some things that I've learned about myself recently and I... I know now that I can never marry Ig. Why are you telling me this? Will you come by the diner later? I really think it will help if you're there when this is all over with. Of course. Thank you. Terry? - It's me. - Oh, Lee... ...you frightened me. - What are you doing down here? Come on, get some dry clothes on you. - I'll drive you home, come on. - No, Lee. - I want to be alone right now. - You're gonna be sick. No. You OK? Here... Hey, hey, Everything will be okay. I got you, I got you. What... what are you doing? There's nobody here except us. Are you joking? I mean, you don't have to pretend anymore. It's fine. No, no, no! Stop it! Don't do... do that! Get off me! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I just... I've been waiting for this for such a long time. I can't believe this is finally happening. - I need to touch you... - No. ...to feel you. No! Listen, you're Ig's best friend. You're my friend. You're my friend. Please, don't you understand anything? I understand everything. I understand everything. Every time the three of us hang out together it's like there's this... elephant in the room. Because we are so clearly suppose to be together but nobody says anything. You know? And, and um... ...we stare at each other, Merrin. We stare at each other. No, let go of me! Don't! You don't know the first thing about what I'm going through right now. What the fuck are you talking about? What about all the signals you've been sending me? What? Signals? What.. Merrin. My God, you thought that I broke up with Ig so that... No, no! I know you love me. I love you, I love you. - I love Ig so much! - Ouch! I love him more than the world! That's the last thing she said? She loved me! You want to know what happened, Ig? - Shut up! - I love... No! Please, no! Damn it! Help, daddy! I gave her what she asked for. Uh! Jesus... Please! Please! It's me! It's me! I fucked her tight little pussy... No, no! - ...and I bashed her face with a rock. - No! You know what? Love made devils of us both. The way I see it, you confessed to me, and were so overwhelmed with guilt that you killed yourself. I've always wanted to try this. It's gonna be fun. It's gonna be fun. OK... Mr. Perrish committed suicide earlier today. We've recovered his vehicle. Perrish's lawyer Lee Tourneau was the only witness of the scene. Mr. Perrish confessed his crimes to Mr. Tourneau and then killed himself. Is there any validity to a report that his body was found in the vehicle? Any reports originating outside the Guinea PD should be considered hearsay conjecture at this time... - ...nothing more. - I got one more question. Breaking news this evening from the police force in Merrin William's case. It occurred tonight that Ig Perrish has... One thing I'll say in my favor, I'm fucking hard to kill. Why the hell aren't you dead? The truth is I don't know the answer to that question myself. I have prayed for so long for you to die but when I saw the news on the TV, it didn't help one bit. I didn't kill her, Mr. Williams. But you know who did it, don't you? You got to tell me. - What will you do if I tell you? - You know what I'll do. But this is my job. If people say you should always do the right thing but sometimes there is no right thing. And then, and then you just have to pick the sin you can live with. Why don't you come inside? Yesterday, I was wondering around the house and I... found this. I thought maybe I should give it to the police, but... that didn't feel right. She wanted you to have this. Thank you. There's something... ...I would like to give you. Here. Merrin's mother gave this to her just before she... You know, son, I think... I think you need this even more than I do. I think you need her to keep you safe. Well now, I guess maybe that's some kind of blessing after all. The horns weren't a curse, but a blessing. They guided me this far. And when I put on her cross, I could feel her protecting me again. "Dear Ig..." "...you'll never read this while I'm alive." "I'm not even sure I want you to read it after I'm dead." "I think you're gonna ask me to marry you soon" "you don't know how much I want to say yes." "But I can't." "The thing is, Ig, I'm very sick." "The sort of cancer I have, it's the kind that runs in families." "I saw my mother go through it." "And I saw what it did to my father." "If I tell you I'm sick, you'll just want to marry me even more," "and I'll be weak and say yes." "And you'll give up your future" "and be shackled to me as I go through hell" and die anyway." "I won't put you through it." "I love you too much." "My plan is to hurt you" "just enough to push you away." "And hopefully, one day, you can forgive me" "and then move on to someone else." "You'll have children, grandchildren" "and great-grandchildren." "You'll go for long walks in the woods." "On one of these walks," "when you're very old," "you'll find yourself at a tree," "a house in its branches." "I'll be waiting for you there." "I'll be waiting by candlelight in our tree house," "shining the light of my cross into your eyes," "the first message I ever sent you." "Us." "I love you, Iggy Perrish." "Your girl, Merrin." Ig. - You're alive. - Hey no, don't. Ig, we have to clear your name. We need to figure out who really killed Merrin. It was Lee. If you are going after Lee, then I am coming with you too. You're not strong enough for that. I'm not leaving you. I made myself a promise, never again. Anything happens to me, I need to know you're all right, for mom and dad's sake. I'll be damned. You and me both. What are you doing out here? You don't remember anything that happened between us, do you? You want to come inside? No, actually I was hoping we could go for a walk. Nobody's looking for me. Pretty much everybody in town thinks I'm dead. - No shit. - So, what do you say? - Just a walk? - Yeah. Why do you bring us here? You know why. This is where you killed Merrin. What happened to you? You lost your mind? Things are going to go a lot easier for both of us if you don't lie to me. Ig... I'm your best friend, you've known me your whole life. You think I have something to do with this? Believe me, all I want to do is... kill you. But I'm trying to be human. I'm trying to be the kind of man Merrin wanted me to be. So I'm giving you this chance to do the right thing. We are going to go down to the police station. - OK. - You're going to turn yourself in. - Keep your hands where I can see them, Lee. Don't do anything stupid. Terry, what the fuck are you doing here, Terry? Terry came to talk to me just now, told me some things about the night Merrin died. Anything he said, he's just trying to save his own ass. - Go fuck yourself. - Yeah, fuck you too. You told everybody that Ig confessed to you and then killed himself. At least one of those things isn't true. So now I'm wondering, what else were you lying to me about? Fuck! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. OK. I didn't mean to hurt her. It was a mistake, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - I want to do the right thing. - OK. OK, I'm gonna fix all of this, OK? - You're doing good. - OK. - OK. - That's right. We've been friends a long time. Fuck! Lee, just put the goddamn gun down! Back the fuck up! OK, OK. OK, OK. Whoa! I'm so sorry, Merrin. I'll see you soon. Aah! Aah... No! Please, Ig... Iggy... In the end, I embraced the horns. Like an angel who fell to earth, I became a devil one last time. The revenge is all consuming, and my time has come to return to you, so we can be together again. I mean, if this isn't paradise, I don't know what is. Are you horny? Um, I'm getting warmer. Oh! Right. No! -Yes. No! I'm going to love you for the rest of my life. Just love me for the rest of mine.
