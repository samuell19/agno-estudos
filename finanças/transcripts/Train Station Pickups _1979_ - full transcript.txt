[MUSIC PLAYING] -That sign says no entrance. What's the matter with you, honey? Can't you read? -I've got to talk to Doris. She said she would tell you I was coming. -She's working out on the [INAUDIBLE] right now. You'll have to wait until she finishes her number. -Don't you get change anymore? -Hold your horses. [MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKING] -What? -What the hell do you want? -I've got to see you, it's important. -Sorry, Petra. There's no way I can lend you 100 marks. We get our salaries once a month in this dump. And mark is my new boyfriend. He's in charge of the bread for both of us. We're saving up to open a new fashion boutique. -100 marks isn't that much money. I've always paid you back. -You got an hour or two to kill? I know a way. You can earn your money for a change. -Doris, I just couldn't. Oh come off it. Nobody's going to screw you. I play funny games with this weirdo. He pays money to have people watch him. [BUZZER] That's where you come in. It's easy money. There he is. Here we are! There's no reason to get uptight. What's the matter with taking money for it if it's the best thing you got to paddle? What's the point in doing it for love? You just have to pay for your own abortions. Believe me, you've got to take it where you can get it. Chubby, what do you think of my friend? Would it turn you on if she watches? -I'll say. Ridey cock horse. [INAUDIBLE] -[NEIGHING] -Come on, get up! Up! Up you go. -Come on, Petra. Give me the whip. -Go ahead. -Come on. I can take it. Go ahead. -You heard him. -I think I'd better do the whipping. She's so new at this. Come on, Missy. Get up. Come on! -[NEIGHING] -Come on, get up! Got to hit those [INAUDIBLE]. Go on. [INAUDIBLE] Come on. It's time to slip those furs where they'll do the most good. Come on. -Don't stop! -I can't keep this up all day, Trigger. Come on. Keep going. Let it happen for you. There! Come on. That's more like it. [GASPS] -Oh yes. -Well, what have we here? A little schoolmate. That's the first time that ever happened. Don't tell me you're suddenly getting fond of school. What did you say you watch [INAUDIBLE]? -I didn't feel like staying outside. Anything wrong with that, Ms. Bauer? -Something is the matter, isn't it Mick? Your face is covered in sweat. Are you ill? -No. I'll feel better in a minute. -I'm worried about you, Mick. There's something you want to know. I believe there's a good deal more to being a teacher then giving lectures and marking my pupils' homework. Now if there's something troubling you, and you think you can use my help, all you have to do is ask for it. What do you say? Some other time, then. -You start by dropping acid and smoking grass. And before you know it, you're shooting up. -When I was about 15, I wasn't getting off on the stuff anymore. So I switched to H. -So I take drugs, big deal. Nobody gives a shit about you, anyway. -I just couldn't hack it at school. Maybe I started because I couldn't communicate with my parents. --[INAUDIBLE] fancy vacation, and they tell me they're too busy to talk to me. -If I had any character, I wouldn't hustle down here. [INAUDIBLE] -Oh hi, Petra. -Have you seen Freddy anywhere? -The dealer? -Uh-huh. -Hong Kong on the rocks. Freddy's hanging around back there, as usual. -Thanks. [MUSIC PLAYING] -What's on your tiny mind, eh? -I need some stuff. But I need two quarters of dope. -OK. Can you afford it? I'm not about to give anybody credit. -I don't believe in credit. Here. -OK. Follow me. Keep it cool. It's the best stuff on the market. [MUSIC PLAYING] -You don't need to do that number. It's top quality H. Hong Kong on the rocks. -OK. But I get 10 marks change. I thought the stuff cost 20 a quarter. -Yeah, it did last month. I get extra for the delivery and handling. It ain't all that safe down here in a subway, hm? -Hey, there's a dead man in there! -Help, please! -What are you staring at me for? He didn't buy it from me. If he'd got the stuff from me, there's no way he would've crapped out. You'd better know it. Let's get the hell out of here. -Now if [INAUDIBLE] can manage to tear himself away from the yellow press, we can continue with 19th century literature. -Your word has always been my command, Ms. Bauer. It's always the same dumb headlines anyway. [LAUGHTER] Love and guts. The paper is full of it. -Well I must say, you do have some very original ideas. I wish I could see a few of them in one or two of your compositions. -Good afternoon, Ms. Bauer. -Better late than never, Petra. Go ahead and sit down. But you can't have it both ways, you know? First you want to be transferred to the afternoon session, and then you come late anyway. Yesterday, we discussed a development which came around at the end of the last century or shortly before that. What was it called? Petra? -Help me. -(WHISPERING) Symbolism. -Symbolism, Ms. Bauer! -Very good. Symbolism is certainly the most significant new thing-- -(WHISPERING) Well, did you get the stuff? -(WHISPERING) Yeah, careful. Don't shoot up more than half of it. Double strength. -Not to mention the wealth of dramatic literature of which-- is there anything wrong? -May I be excused? -Very well. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I hope nothing happened to Mick. I'm starting to get worried. -You should have started before you got involved with an addict. -You know how it is, he's so helpless. -Well what are you? His girlfriend or his mother substitute? -By tomorrow's class, I'd like all of you to have read the first five chapters of Madame Bovary. All right? Class dismissed. -[SHRIEK] -Remember those two quickies I picked up in the station yesterday morning? Easiest 200 I ever made. -What guarantee do I have you pick up two chicks in the station every morning? No honey. At that rate, it'll take us 10 years to scrape together the money for our shop. I'm not going to have you peddle your ass all that time. -Got any better ideas? -Efficiency. That's where it's at. -That's the only way to run any business, no matter what you're selling. Take my word for it. I only want the best for you. After all, you're my special girl, aren't you? Eh? Money always did grow on trees. You just have to know where to pick it. [ENGINE REVVING] [CHATTER] -Sorry boys. Here it comes! [CHATTER] -Bet you thought I wasn't coming? Well I keep my promises. And look at the nice surprise I brought you. [INTERPOSING VOICES] [WHISTLES] -Nice, light skin European girl? Smile at him, you moron. Screws like a bunny. Can't get enough. Bet you never had a piece of anything like this before? -Mark! Is this some kind of joke? -Hand's off! Everybody's going to get a turn. 40 marks is all you have to pay up. -I don't want to! -Shut up. Nobody gives a shit what you want. Now shut up and get your ass in the truck. Just pull down your pants. That's all you get. One at a time, fellows. One at a time. Easy does it, fellows! Everybody's going to get a turn. All right. Get in there. You've got ten minutes, so get it over with fast. Cool it, fellows, give me a break. Now line up. Have your money ready. 40 marks? That's right. Yeah? Thanks a lot. [PANTING] -Jolly good, Gabby! Now come along, Tina. Don't fall asleep. There's a good girl. Petra? Look alive, girl. Come along! [INAUDIBLE], Tina. That's it, that's it. That's it! Tina, I don't think we'll ever get this right. Now, stop! I've had enough of this nonsense. What do you think this is, a circus? Now girls, time for your wall barre exercises. Hop to it. Come on boys, over here. That's it. Keep it moving. Very good. Good. Fine. Oh, just a minute. --[INAUDIBLE] beginning of the game, then? -I hurt my foot, so I can't ride. -You don't say? But you could climb up this pole here. Your arms seem in perfect condition. -No can do Mr. Steinberger. I'm afraid of heights. -And I suppose you expect me to believe that? -What do I have to do? Get sick to my stomach? -Are you coming to the party on Saturday? -I will if I can get Mick to come along. -All right, then, girls. Up with your legs. Nice and straight. Good time. Very good indeed. Knees nice and straight. That's it. No one told you to stop, young ladies. Come on, keep moving. Keep moving. Don't want the joints getting rusty. -Don't want the joints getting rusty. What a crock. -Now then, Gabby. Try to lead with your hips. Come on. Through. Nice. That looks like the washing hanging out to dry. I'm sorry, it's impossible. Absolutely impossible. -I've got a feeling Mr. Steinberger's got a crush on me. -I'll say you've got a feeling. Every time he [INAUDIBLE] he feels you all over, all in the [INAUDIBLE]. -That still won't stop him from flunking in math. -And you as well. -If Mr. S has got hot pants for you the way we think he does, we ought to be taking advantage of it. -What are you talking about? -I'm hatching a plan. Just listen to this! -Your water's hotter than mine. -[INAUDIBLE] dummy. [SHRIEKS] -Do you suppose we can grab ourselves a peek of the girls in the shower? -Can you jump that high? [GRUNTING] -Watch out. I think I've got it. You stand down here and hold out your hands. I'll go up and have a look. [GIGGLING] -Hey, what are you? Squirly? I'm not going to scream like that so you can get a look-- -All right. All right. That's all I ever asked you. I'll find some other way to do it. [LAUGHING] -Now, watch an old master at work. Maybe you can learn something. Here goes. [GRUNTING] -Hey, hey, hey! Come on, that's cold. Hey lay off. Don't. Hey, cool it. You couldn't do this to me. [LAUGHING] -[INAUDIBLE] -But my name's Bill! [LAUGHTER] -Oh. [LAUGHTER] -Where does it hurt? -In your ass if you don't cut that out. Ha ha ha. Damn girls. -Hey, are you going to the soccer game Saturday? -No way, man. Can't afford a ticket. I got one extra. My old man's got to work that day. -Far out. -Hey, what do you say, Petra? There's a real groovy disco around the corner. Want to go? -Sorry, [INAUDIBLE]. See you later. -Oh, so I'm not good enough for you, huh? -[INAUDIBLE] storm, is that it? I'm not interested in that act. -It's no act. Let's go dancing! -Want to go over to the Zine Club Petra? -Not really. Why don't we go up to my place? I know my mother's out. She's got a new boyfriend. [KNOCKING] [KNOCKING] -Good heavens. What's the matter with you, Gabby? -I'm so glad you finally found me. I tripped and fell on my way to the locker room. Now, I can't put any weight on my foot. -Oh my goodness, that's terrible. Now don't try to get up. Don't move at all. I'll deal with it straight away. Now then. I want you to tell me exactly where it hurts the most. -Here. -Down here? -Right. -And what happens when I move up here? How does that feel? Does that hurt as well? Does the pain go up into your hip? -No. It's up here. That place really hurts a lot. -Does this hurt? -No not really. That feels all right. -Really? This is very confusing. What do you suppose we ought to do now? Do you have any idea? -You know what I think? -Yes? -I think the best thing would be for you to carry me into the locker room. -Of course. Why didn't I think of that myself? -Oh! -There we go. And what now? -If you wouldn't mind helping me get dressed, and then go upstairs and call the doctor in the teacher's room. Absolutely. You're absolutely right, Gabby. I can't imagine why I didn't think of that myself. -That was super! Perfect! Really far out! And wait until teacher gets a look at these snapshots. His eyes will pop right out of his head! -I think we ought to be a little ashamed of ourselves, don't you? -Well, can you afford to fail mathematics? -M-mm. -Neither can I. What else can we do? [MUSIC PLAYING] -Don't tell me that's another one of your girlfriends? -I'll say. Would you believe the poor thing's been all night banging on my door? But I wouldn't let her out. -Honestly, I don't think you've got anything else in your head. -Only it isn't in my head, it's somewhere else. See what I can do. It's rum. Let's mix it with a little Pepsi, get things started. OK? [MUSIC PLAYING] -Petra-- -Don't say anything, Mick. We really like one another. That's what counts. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Look at that one. -Mm. How about her? -What is this? Senior citizens night in the red light district? They look like somebody's grandmother. -So what? How about May West? She's got to be almost 90. -It says in the paper she's got hot and cold running men all over the house. Compared to her, these chicks are all teenagers. -Yeah, but she isn't one of these hookers. Tell me, how much does it cost to do it with one of these broads? -I don't know. About 20 marks, I suppose. -That's a real bargain when you think of all you'll learn, Chub. It's like going to college. Hey, here comes one. [MUSIC PLAYING] [RAINDROPS] -Dirk, please don't. -What's wrong with you? -I've had enough. -We were having so much fun, and then all of a sudden this. -I just don't want to. Not with you. -Oh please, Petra. I-- -My name's [INAUDIBLE], not Petra. -I'm sorry. Anyone can make a mistake, hm? -It depends. I'm afraid that mistake gave you away. That's why I'm just not interested in making love. Let's face it. You couldn't get Petra so you figured at least [INAUDIBLE] is better than an empty bed. -Oh come on. You don't believe that. -It's the truth, Dirk. You better start looking your facts in the eye. Petra's the one you want. And I'm not going to play substitute. Why don't we forget about this whole discussion? And how about giving me a ride home? -OK. -Thanks. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Tell me, Mick. What's wrong? -I just can do it. -There's nothing to worry about. Give yourself a little time and-- -It's not what you think. It's that I'm so disgusted with myself. -Withdrawal symptoms. We've got some more stuff. -The hell we have, Petra. I shot that stuff hours ago. I'm starting to need more and more of it. And when I think what you have to do to get it for me-- -But you've got to have it, Mick. You can't go cold turkey until school is over. And I don't want you hustling anymore. I can't stand the thought-- -Come off it. Is that any worse than what you're doing with those filthy old men? -How else are we going to scrape together the 4,000 marks we need for your habit every month? -I swear it. I'm only doing it for you. I love you so much. -When you're not making it with those bastards. -They don't mean anything to me. I've never let one of them lay a finger on me. I've promised you that. -Stop it. Stop it! I can't stand it. I'm not worth it. You deserve better. You're ruining your whole life for a miserable addict. I'm really not worth it. -Mick, listen to me! That money I gave you last week, you remember? The 750 marks? I didn't earn that money. I got it from my mother. I'm telling the truth. -Fine. Now you're stealing for me! -Please, Mick! Please come back here. [DOOR BELL] -I could have sworn that was Mick running down the stairs. I guess it wasn't. I hope you had a nice evening, dear. We had a wonderful time. Oh yes, this is Udo. Remember? I told you I'd met this charming gentleman at the office. And this young lady is my beautiful little daughter Petra. -Glad to meet you, honey. You know, you're just as sweet and pretty as your mama. -There has been too much wine with dinner. That's why I invited him up for a cup of coffee. Don't mind us. You'd better get some sleep. Goodnight dear! -Don't forget your prayers, honey! -Udo. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Now then, which of you two handsome studs is going to be the first to take the plunge? (IN UNISON): He is! -Hey, the whole thing was your idea, Bill. -Yeah, but I had to borrow the money from you. After all, Ms.Hooker, I mean it's only fair that the one who coughs up the cash gets the first shot. -You're absolutely right. You come first. -No, wait a minute. I thought-- -Up and at 'em, trailblazer! I'll be right behind you. -Hey listen, Bill. I have a-- -You're on. Coming through. -Excuse me, sir. -So long. -So long, Mary. [MUSIC PLAYING] -No way--! Come on-- [INTERPOSING VOICES] -She's a he! -Bastards, look at this thing. My wig was [INAUDIBLE], this was all afternoon. I ask you, sir. What's a poor girl to do? -Do you have any idea where Mick could be? -No. -Something serious must be the matter. You know as well as I do that Mick can't afford to miss this exam. -What's the big discussion, girls? One more word and you can hand in your papers and fail the course. What is it, Petra? -May I be excused? I'm finished, sir. -Very well then, but hand in your paper first. -Just put this in the examination book, and-- -Quiet back there, Tina. I thought [INAUDIBLE] equations with two unknowns would be a topic for conversation. -You want to bet? -Hello? -This is Petra. Could I please speak to Mick? -Oh, Petra. I'm so glad you called. Something terrible has happened. We found out Mick is addicted to narcotics. My husband found a silver spoon and hypodermic needles in his room. There was a terrible brawl, Mick's father threw him out of the house, just like that! I don't know what I'm going to do. Mick is all I've got. How could children make their parents so miserable? -Let us start finishing up. Time's running out. -This time I know for certain that I got an A in mathematics. -And so did I. -I certainly hope so for your sakes. But that's highly unlikely, considering the quality of your classroom work. -Wait until you see the quality of our own work. -Have fun marking this examination. Revenge is sweet. [BELL] [MUSIC PLAYING] -All right, I heard you! I'll be right down. What are you doing ringing the door bell in the middle of the night? -I'm looking for a boy named Mick. Does he live here with you? -Yeah, I think so. Come on sweetie. He's probably crashed out somewhere. Is Mick there? Wake up! -What is happening? -You seen Mick around? -He's out hustling. -Sorry about that, sweetie. Those junkies are all like. You've got it bad for that kid, ain't you? -Mhm. -You shooting up horse, too? Don't be a fool, girl. Forget that turkey ever lived. Trouble is always their middle name. And the damn squares all keep wondering why the kids today never feel like laughing. -Is that you, Petra? She's a friend of mine. -Well, there's no time for that bullshit now. What you need is a stiff shot and a hot bath. The next date's in two hours. You dig? -Doris! -What's the big hurry, teacher? -Did you have a chance to look at our test papers yet? -Surprised with our equations, huh? -I most certainly was. But don't think for one minute you're going to get away with this. -Get away with what? -Mr. Steinberger, you look like you could do with a ride. -Hey teacher, where do you think you're going? I thought we had a little something to talk about. What's the story? -I do want to discuss this unfortunate matter, but not now. -[INAUDIBLE] -Haven't seen Mick anywhere have you? -Nope. He wasn't down here today. Sorry. You might try checking down the street in a bar. The Salambo. The joint's full of queers and bull dikes. He's usually there peddling his ass to some fag. [MUSIC PLAYING] -So I said to him, anyone who could suggest that [INAUDIBLE] is the best [INAUDIBLE] on the stage today, has obviously never heard [INAUDIBLE]. But it only stands to reason, hm? Cheers! [MUSIC PLAYING] -Well, what do you say? Shall we go? You go on ahead. -Looks like two lonely people just found each other. Stuck up. -Now then, I hope you weren't planning to run away. A bargain is a bargain in any business, isn't it? Oh by the way, I'm not planning to use the whip. Unless you're a very naughty boy. And now, time for some fun. What is it? I've already paid you. Now go to work. Don't be afraid now. -So it wasn't a rumor. You brought home another hustler. -Now don't start behaving like a jealous old queen? Get out of here. You're in the way. Leave us alone! -So you think you can order me out? -Come in or go out. Suit yourself. You're perfectly welcome to stay and watch if you want, but keep quiet. -You can do better than those filthy boys in the station! -Either get the hell out of here or shut up! -I'll get out all right, if that's what you want. But someday you'll be sorry. -He makes me sick. Come here, you. -Please don't make me do it. I don't want to! -You don't want to? What kind of talk is that? -Please? -You should've talked like that before you took my money. You better do what I said. I told you what happens, naughty boy. -No! -Not so fast. -[INAUDIBLE] [PANTING] -Hey, hi Petra. -Hi Dirk. -Well aren't you going to ask me what I'm doing here? -All right, I'll bite. -I've been waiting for you. What do you think of my new bike? Hot Wheels. A present from my mother and father. -Super. -I've got a good idea. Why don't the two of us go out for happy hour in Discoland? -Not today, Dirk. I've got much too much homework. -Well some other time, then. See you. -Do I have to go back to the trailer? -Sweetheart, that chapter of our life is over, thank God. I've got another set up all worked out. Rich dudes with good manners. Less work for more money. I met this real nice guy the other night, a gentleman. Vice president of some electronics company. His old lady hasn't been giving him any lately and he's only human, after all? -Are we making a house call? -Where do you keep your brains, honey? In your purse? I just told you the cat was married. No, I got you two a real nice room in a hotel out in the suburbs. It's nice and secluded out there. Nobody will hear a sound. I only want the best for you, you know that. -Yeah, sure. -You're a lady with expensive habits, if you know what I mean. We spent 800 marks on your shit last week alone. Now get in the car. [MUSIC PLAYING] -How's it going? -I'm all right. -Lily, this is Doris. -Hello. Always happy to see a new face in this dump. There there, Grandpa! Now why don't you go home and take some of those nice little liver pills? You'll be feeling better in no time. And when you feel up to it, you know there's always an empty bed for you at the old homestead. This way out. Now off you go. Tell Grandma to make you a nice hot cup of tea. Have a nice day. See you! Let me out of the old folks ward! I thought he was going to have a heart attack right in the middle. Well enough of that, says I! He has himself a beautiful [INAUDIBLE], and I'm up to my tits in coppers! Mark says a gentleman won't [INAUDIBLE]. -You don't say. What did I tell you? More pay for less work. Now you know who loves you. -Come along, Doris. Well, I see the fashion boutique routine still works. -How'd you like a fat lip, mousie? -OK. Forget I said it. -You ordered some champagne? Here you are. -You don't expect me to drink that mouse piss? -You can have the imported if you'd like. -Well then. Let's have a look at that seat of satisfaction. -There's just nipple pleasure. -Certainly. It's business as usual. -Here's your French champagne. '75 Veuve Cliquot. That'll be 400 marks. -Right. -Thank you. No wait! I'd like to do that. That was part of the bargain. This makes me feel like Columbus discovering America. -Columbus? -Yeah, 1400 and-- I was never any good with dates. -I'll say. -Mmm. -You buying a new car, again? -Yeah. Tall cylinder job. -All right. -Got to keep the old pistons going. Make them happy, Doris. Think about that nice boutique. -What's this? Don't tell me that's mosquito bites? I won't buy that. I was in the medical core. I know a needle mark when I see one. -If you really want to know, I'm a drug addict. -Drug addict? High stuff? Hm? That makes it even nicer. I'm told drug addicts never get enough sex. I don't drink champagne out of glasses. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Udo, cut that out. Oh-- -Don't mind me! -You're home early, dear. Why don't you come watch television with us? Have a seat. -Sit down, kid! -No thanks. I've got a composition due tomorrow. -Have a sandwich first. It's in the refrigerator. What in [INAUDIBLE] is wrong with that child? I kill myself working to see that she has food on the table and a roof over her head. -Uh huh. -And she treats me like the dirt under her feet. -Maybe she's noticed something. I mean about the two of us. -That child is as innocent as a newborn babe. I'm sure she hasn't caught onto anything. -I hope you did tell her we are going on a trip together. When could I? By the time she gets up in the morning, I'm already at work. And then in the evening, something always comes up. -Like me. -I'm entitled to a little private life, too. That still doesn't mean I'm a neglectful mother, does it? -Don't be silly. -Want something? -No daughter, not a thing. I just wanted to ask you-- your vacation starts pretty soon, doesn't it? -Oh mother, you know tomorrow's the last day of school. -Yes of course. Well, Udo is taking a couple of days off from work. And I've got some time coming, two more weeks in fact. I thought it would be nice-- that is, actually, we-- but of course, only if it's all right with you! -Mother, you don't need my permission to go on vacation with your boyfriend. -I know that. But we won't be away very long. A week or so, that's all. But only if you're sure you don't mind. Petra, darling. I'm afraid I feel a little guilty about all this. If only I-- -You're a grown woman. I don't know why you should feel guilty. I can manage a week on my own. -You're growing up to be a real lady. I'm so proud of you. And I'm glad we can discuss things. -We ought to discuss things a little more often, if you know what I mean. How about it, mother? -I know it was there this-- Petra? Petra! [RUNNING WATER] -Well, where is it? -What? I don't understand. -You understand, all right. You helped yourself to my money. I saved 750 marks for my vacation. Where is it? You are a criminal! Nothing but a common criminal. I give my child everything that she needs. And what thanks do I get? She steals my hard earned money! What kind of a person have you turned out to be? -I didn't take the money for myself. I'm really not a criminal. Somebody was desperate. A friend. Somebody who would've been totally destroyed. I had to help them get that money. Believe me, mother. -Hey, what's wrong with you two? -Nothing. It's none of your affair, Udo. -OK. OK. I can take it. -Very well. You've got exactly two days to go out and recover that money. Or else you go to a children's home. It's up to you. -Take me along, Mick! -No, I'm late as it is. -Then why don't we get together later this afternoon? Or tomorrow? We can't just split up like this. -Yes we can. It's better that way. For both of us. -Mick, what am I supposed to tell my mother now? -Let him go, Petra. Who needs him? He's beyond help. -Maybe you're right. -What's the problem with your mother? -I helped myself to 750 marks of her vacation money. And if she doesn't get it back this evening, she's putting me in a home for girls. -Is this the Steinberger residence? One moment. -What do I say to him? -That we have to see him and discuss things. -Hello sir, this is Gaby. I think we ought to get together and discuss this little matter. -As soon as possible. -As soon as possible, sir. Tomorrow at 3:00 PM? At your home. Very good. Come on. [MUSIC PLAYING] -One more Coca Cola, with rum. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Move that pretty little ass of yours, and get me a brandy, all right? -Hey buddy, how do you like those broads? -You need [INAUDIBLE] gloves before you can lay a finger on them. -You must be one hell of a stud if you can turn these chicks on. I can't get them to look at me. -Nothing to it, Val. Anyone can do it. Hey, you got a stick? -You bet I do. And ready for action. -Not that one, you ding dong. A weed. -Oh, a cigarette. -There's got to be some kind of [INAUDIBLE]. You can't just walk over and-- -Why not? Just march over heavy. If you see something you like, just lay a little sweet talk on her, and before you know it, you're making [INAUDIBLE]. -I don't know, it all sounds too easy. How about you show me how you do it? -It never fails. You can take my word for it. -That one. How do you make it with her? [MUSIC PLAYING] -Ow! -What do you think this is? A boxing arena? You keep your filthy hands off the lady, or I'll make a necklace out of your molars. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Do you think you'll be all right? -Of course, that was just a trick. I make believe they knocked me out. That throws them off their guard. -I'm just glad somebody's gentleman enough to protect your girl from a bully. -Don't make a habit of it. By the way, my name's Billy. What's yours? -Bebe. -You know something, Bebe? You're too nice a girl for this dump. When we find a place with a little more class, all right? -Mhm. -This must be the place. -Is this the classy disco you were talking about? -Well, it isn't really a disco. It's my pad. But it's just as classy. -Afraid not. -There's really no obligations involved. Stick with me. I just wanted to have a quick drink before we go somewhere else. -All right. One little glass of wine and no more. -Bottoms up. -Well I suppose I should be getting home. -What you mean? You just got here. -If I hurry up, I might still make the last subway at midnight. I don't know how to express my thanks. -Thanks for what? -For everything. I appreciate you getting rid of that awful bully. -Oh yeah, him. Those guys will do anything. You've got to be so careful. -What else do you suppose that awful man might have done? -If I hadn't just come along at the right minute, he would've taken you home to his bed and slammed you down on his bed, for starters. -Oh! -Like this. -What then? -And then he would have covered your sweet little face with kisses. [BEDFRAME SQUEAKING] -Then what? -Then? Then he would have ripped off your dress, like this. Then he'd be stroking you lightly here, like this. -Oh, [INAUDIBLE]. That's wonderful. Have you had many girlfriends? -No. You're the first one. Honest. -I'm afraid I never made love before either, Bill. Please don't stop. -What? You've never? I think I'd better look this one up. I don't want to make any mistakes. "Hello Young Lovers". That's the name of the book. My Uncle Gus gave it to me as a confirmation present. Why don't you hold it? An adept lover will put all his skill and imagination to work arousing his partner in the foreplay phase. This phase will include tender, passionate kisses on the various erogenous zones of the body. Right! His fingers will play lightly on her torso. OK. Oh yeah, I did that before, didn't I? As she becomes increasingly aroused, entering into the so-called intermediary phase, her breasts will take on the appearance of little doorbells. So they do! Ding dong. Come in, and I will-- The male will also notice his reproductive organ is erect and-- better check that. It's down here, right? Really. This book is terrific. -I think we can improvise the next part. They weren't so tight before! -Ah! -Oh no! -Oh. -Hello, what are you waiting for? We'll never get it over with this way. Steinberger said to be here at 3 o'clock. We don't want to be late. -I don't know why I listen to you. You're always getting in trouble. -Oh stop the grousing. We started it. Now we're going to have to see it through. -That's the last time I ever take a shower with a friend. -OK. You just sit there a duchess who doesn't know how to talk. Is that clear? I'll do all the talking. All right? [DOORBELL] -So it's you two, is it? Come in then. I will lead the way. In there. I'll be right back. Let's go! -It's too late to turn 10 and run now. Sit down. You didn't reckon on this development, did you? -We had a date with Mr. Steinberger. This is a private matter between him and us. -Don't get fresh. You two girls wouldn't even be sitting here with me if I hadn't convinced Mr. Steinberger to change his mind. You'd be in juvenile court. -What for? We're not criminals. -You're both blackmailers, and there's more than enough evidence. -And what happens if we show those pictures to our parents? -Not so fast, Tina. You're not that clever. You slipped a note in that test in your own handwriting. It proves that the whole thing was a complete fabrication. Care for a cigarette? -M-mm. I admit what we did to Mr. Steinberger was pretty miserable. But we couldn't afford to fail math. -What? -Just 1,000 marks for these wheels? -That's what it's worth. -My parents paid 2,500 three weeks ago. I haven't driven it that much. -Don't waste your breath arguing. 1,000 marks is my final offer. I'm not in business for my health, son. Take it or leave it. You're broke. Not me. -I think we've reached a sensible agreement. The negatives will be turned over to you, and we'll pretend the whole thing never happened. -Here. -Is that all of them? -Just a minute, sir. What do you think we are? -I think that has already been established. -And what about our grade in mathematics? -You didn't have one single problem right. So naturally, you fail the course. You'll simply have to repeat it next term and do a little studying for a change. -Try using your intelligence for your school work. -We could use a little tutoring after hours in math. -Lord spare me. I'm not taking any chances with you two after hours. -All right. [DOORBELL] -Hello, Dirk. What brings you here? -Nothing special. Listen, I'm in a big hurry. So long! [DOORBELL] -Hi. -Hi, aren't you ready to go yet? -[INAUDIBLE] a miracle happened! Mick returned the 750 marks! I can't tell you how happy I am. -What, Mick? I hate to spoil your illusions. He didn't give back the money. It was a gift from Dirk. I caught him sneaking out of the house. Homosexual murder, killer still at large. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hey, you get some money back. -I don't want it. Keep the change, man. -Why, if it isn't Freddy. [GRUNTING] -Ain't going no place, Fred! Just wanted to see how you're-- -You can't do this to me! I-- -Open up, there. Police! Identity check. We know you're in there. Police identity check. Come on, open up! Go ahead. You better give us that [INAUDIBLE]. Easy now. -You bastards! Why did you have to come now? -That's it. -I'll kill you. Let me go! Please let me go. -Do we have to go to Rida's house? I'm not in the mood for party. -Stop talking nonsense. What else are you going to do? Sit around here brooding? I'm not going to let you. -Do you suppose Mick might still show up? -You waste so much time worrying about that boy. And what if he does come? It would serve him right not to find you here for a change. After the way he treated you this afternoon, he's really got it coming to him. -How do you like my blouse? -Super! You'll be a real knockout in it. You'll have all the boys fighting over you. -You don't believe that yourself. -I'll tell you this. If I were a boy, I'd be crazy about you. [MUSIC PLAYING] -We'd better get started. We don't want to get to the party late. -What is this shit? Why are you locking me up here? -I really don't know. Normally your kind are held in protective custody until they can establish a permanent residence, -But I've got a permanent residence. All right, then. They must be holding you for some other reason. -What am I accused of? What do they want from me? -You'll find that out from the magistrate first thing tomorrow morning. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SHRIEKING] [GIGGLING] -This is my brother, Garrett. He's a graduate student at the university. This is Gaby. -Well, I've been waiting for someone like you to come along. Let's dance. -All right. [MUSIC PLAYING] -All the best to you. Come on, Petra. Just try to cheer up! -Who gives a damn whether I do or not. -Hey, what's the matter with you two beauties? What do you say we go do a trio out there? OK? Then the two of us. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] -Oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh. [MOANING] [WATER DRAINING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Anybody want to chase on Meg? [INTERPOSING VOICES] -Tina's up to her old tricks again. She's going to get somebody in trouble. Just watch. -Don't you think it's time to teach her a lesson? -Such as--? -That's brilliant. Serves the bitch right. -Hey, come on over here, Tina! -OK. -Honey, you're drinking too much. -Come on, you're not used to the stuff. -So what? Anybody can get used to anything. Oh, by the way. Thanks. Thanks for the money, Dirk. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Oh, far out! The two of them are really making it. -Let me see! [LAUGHTER] -What's going on out here? -Want to get yourself a liberal education? -I don't understand. -Take a peak in there. -All right. -Here it goes. -Hey, let me out of here! -See you in the morning kids. Have fun! Come on girls, this isn't funny! Let me out of here. Gaby! -Oh shit. Well I suppose that's a breaks. Looks like we really feel for it. -What's that supposed to mean? -You know. They want us to make the scene together. -What a joke. -Of course you're right. -So, you don't think the two of us could get it on with one another? Is that what you mean? -I've always wondered what you looked like without those dumb glasses. -You know, you look kind of like an owl yourself. After all, if they're going to leave us in here, we might as well make the scene. What do you think, Tony? -Sure. Say, where did you get that pretty little amulet? Hm? -Cut it out! -OK. OK. Well, sac time. -What are you doing? -Nobody's going to let us out, and I can't make it with you. I might as well take advantage of the situation and get myself a good night's sleep. Goodnight. -I'm ashamed of myself. He loved that bike. And I'm not worth that mind of sacrifice. -Gah. -Oh go away! I want to get out of here! -Oh cut it out. You're making no sense! -Let go of me! I said let go of me! -Come on, Petra. -Let go-- -Off we go. I'll manage. I guess I better take her home. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Are you asleep, Tony? -Mhm. -I'm kind of cold. Would you like to warm me up? -I'm tired. -You want me to freeze all night? -Hm. -Hey, I don't feel like going to sleep yet. -Try. -Come on. Tony. Don't start snoring! Tony! Keep me company. Tony. -Mm? -Isn't anything happening down there? -Mhm. Sure is. -Well what do you know? Come on! This way down! [SHRIEKING] [GIGGLING] -Oh. Oh. [AIRPLANE NOISE] -Mother? -Sorry, she left on vacation yesterday. -Dirk, I don't get it? -Oh, I'm the new maid. -How did you get in here? -Well, somebody had to get you home last night. Just a minute, don't you remember anything from last night? -I must have really [INAUDIBLE]. -You tied on enough for a regiment. You were feeling no pain. -And then you took me home? Is that what happened? -Right. I'm the one who took you home, and then I got you into bed. And then I slept in the living room. -Oh man, have I got a headache. -I think the best thing you can do is forget the whole business. -You're right. -I've got an idea. My folks have got a little place out in the country not very far away. Why don't the two of us spend a couple of days there together? It'll help you take your minds off things, hm? -I don't know, Dirk. -You've got nothing to be afraid of. I'll keep my hands to myself. -Juice, butter, bread. Teacher, your breakfast's ready! -Coming! Well, I must say, you do make a very good case for getting up early. -The defense never rests. -Tell me, do you have to go to court today? -I wouldn't think of it. I told them they could hang all my clients. I wanted to take advantage of your school holidays. [BUZZER] -Not that telephone again. Don't even answer it. Hey! -Hello? Why of course not, you're not interrupting anything! -Lies like a rug. -What did you say? What Mick? I don't believe it. Yes of course. I know a very good lawyer. Of course. I'll have him go down and see Mick at once. We'll ring you back. -No. No more calls, please. Why don't you take the phone off the hook? Come over here. -Of course, this is an emergency. I'm afraid you're going to have to go right down to the prison. It's that boy I told you about. You know, Mick? He was arrested in a drug raid down at the railway station. -They just give those kids a slap on the wrist and send them home. -They won't this time. He's been accused of murder. Horst? Remember the homosexual who was killed? [MUSIC PLAYING] -They only had two dozen tulip bulbs left, but the florist said they might have some more in next week. -That's more than enough. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Look over there! The daffodil bulbs are beginning to sprout. -Tell me. Are you sorry that I took you out to the country? -Oh no, I'm enjoying it! I'm glad I came here. You know, you've been wonderful. I never thought I'd feel good again. I just need some time to get it together. Now, unpack those tulip bulbs for me, and let's get them planted. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Here. -Thanks. [MUSIC PLAYING] -At least there's one good thing about jail. I'm off the needle. I'm clean again. I couldn't have done this anywhere else. But my first few days, I've never felt that miserable. I didn't think I'd live through it. -OK Mick. I'm glad to hear that. But it's still going to be a job getting you out of here. -I wish I knew if I did it. I felt so miserable. So ashamed of what had become of me. That man was a bastard, tried to choke me. That was when I felt the candlestick. -Don't forget, you were still on turkey. You remember how miserable you felt? You said so yourself. Do you really think you had the strength to hit a man hard enough to kill him? I mean, did you really-- -I wish-- I wish I knew. That man was disgusting. He was choking me with his whip. I hit him with a candlestick, and then I ran away. -Now there's one more thing. Was there anything unusual about that house? Did you see anyone else there? [MUSIC PLAYING] -OK, dinner's almost ready. I made us a real feast. After all, it's our farewell dinner. -I wish it hadn't gone by so quickly. -Yes, so do I. -Was it fun being with me, Petra? [MUSIC PLAYING] -Please, please Dirk. -Yeah? -Wait a minute? What's that smell? -Something's burning! -The souffle! Oh-- -Oh man. -You see? It wasn't meant to be. -What wasn't? -Our farewell dinner. -I must say that's my favorite kind of acquittal. The case didn't even have to go to trial. -And just in the nick of time. One day before school starts again. -I sure am lucky I got such a good lawyer. -You see, this case got special attention. I wouldn't have been able to come home if I hadn't won this one. -So he was the one? -Yes, he was brought in this morning. He signed a full confession. I knew we'd find something if we checked the inheritance records. -The garden never looked so good. -One of these days somebody's going to have to explain to me why school is so long and vacations always go by so quickly. -After school, we can go back out to the country. OK? -Sure. -Mick! [MUSIC PLAYING] [BELL] [MUSIC PLAYING]
