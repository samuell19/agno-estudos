Upon the discovery late last night of several dismembered bodies. Local police believe we may be dealing with Hereford's first serial killer. Do you want to drive? No thanks. Oh, too much light. What are you doing? I don't remember. Being so much noise around here. Not in the morning. Come to bed. What is it? Nothing. Nightmares again? Just thinking about things, that's all. You think too much. Ken. Ken. Is everything alright? You seem a bit embarrassed about something. Nope, not me. What was that about? Counting on me reading your mind with my super powers? What is it? We've been given a month's notice to quit. We're being evicted? Yep. My God, is it because I complained about the stair carpet, isn't it? It's got to be. It's too much of a coincidence. It's thread bare. - I know. One complaint in four years, and he goes and does this. Jesus, Connor, we're being evicted and you're laughing. No, I'm not laughing at you. It's him. He's nuts. He'd rather get rid of us than buy a new stair carpet. He's a cheapskate twat. Okay, well, might not be funny now, but, you know, in the grand scheme of things. Or not. I'm so sick of living like this. We should have our own place. We'll find somewhere. We will. Somewhere with even tackier carpets. I can get on to the letting agencies. I'm free this afternoon. We'll be okay. Yeah. Here will do. Don't be daft, I'll drop you off. No, it's fine. Don't want you doing that to your car. You want your mates to take the piss. No? I'll see you later. Love the car. I thoroughly enjoyed the chocolate biscuits. Every time. Why not? There you are. Oh. I'm so sorry. Is everything alright? I was gonna say, it's probably cold by now. No, no, it's fine, thanks. I'm awash with tea. Jess says I drink too much of the stuff. Oh, she's only looking after you. And your bladder. Take care, sweetheart. Thank you so much for being so understanding. Oh, well. Been a tough couple of weeks, what with bills, the car needing four new tires. It's all those bloody potholes. Back to normal next month, though. And like we said, we'll give you a bit more. Talk about 200, much appreciated. - Take care. - You too, love. Bye. That was bizarre. The hunt for international superstar and south lake billionaire, Jean Claud Miraud, continues with a recent Sighting of him off the north coast of France earlier today. It is understood he was trying to cross the English channel in an attempt to evade French authorities over his recent To Hereford now, where concerns are growing for the welfare of three missing persons. Detectives released a statement that the three were last seen leaving the Lutt Cinema in West Street at approximately 11:55 pm on Saturday. They are eager to speak with the owner of a black transit van seen parked in the street right of the disappearance. - Hello! God, you scared the shit out of me. Did Mike give you a lift? Yeah. How'd you get on with letting agencies? That bad, eh? Yeah. Well, we'll find a solution. We always do. Worst case scenario, we'll have to put you to work on Castle Green. I'd do it myself, but, don't look that great in heels. Shut up. What? Quite rather fancy myself as a bit of a pimp. Oh, my god. Have you called your mom lately? No. You should. I know. But... I know, I'll call her at the end of the week. Leave it. Okay. You sure about that Castle Green thing, though? Ken. Is that you, Ken? Of course it's me. Who else do you think it is? Here, darling. What's up? Nothing. Nothing. Just glad you're home. Everything alright? Fine. Just been one of those days. We're out of beer. Oh, I'm sorry. I'll get some in for tomorrow. How was your day? Uh, so-so. Still haven't finished that flaming battle job, cowboy installation. Christ, you should see it. They have massive pipes all over the place. Bloody nightmare. Visitors? - Sue and Jeff. On the cards again. What do they want this time? Ah, they just called in all the way back from town. Seemed very grateful about something. Water's still hot. Why don't you jump in the shower? Yeah, in a minute. What were they so grateful about? Oh, nothing important. You know what they're like, full of themselves. I stopped listening after a while. Just as long as they weren't trying to squirm their way out of paying back the cash. What have you done? They just asked if they could defer this month's payment. They've been having a bit of a hard time. Oh and you said yes. I knew this would happen, I knew it. Shouldn't have lent them four quid, never mind four grand. The sly bastards knew better than to call in when I was here. No wonder they were grateful. And you gave them cake. Oh, they'll be back on track next month. They will be. - Better bloody be. You have to stop being so nice. They ask you again, you say no, okay? Okay. Remember, that's our holiday fund. They don't get it back in time, it's bye bye Las Vegas, and hello Blackpool. I won't be happy. Me neither. It's alright to say no. Want some tea? I thought takeaway tonight, yeah? You up for that? Always. Thank god. I love you. I love you, too. Ken. Do you ever wonder where all the time went? Frequently. Nobody warns you about that, do they? Nope. Not your parents, school. Life, eh? It should carry a good until forewarning. Do you see the beauty of it? Now, do you realize what we've done? Look at them. No, please. Look at them! Why are you doing this? We will be forever dancing. Thank you. We've got to talk about horror slightly. Halloween eve. So, what better day than to turn to modern heritages most- Do you want a hand? No, tah. I'm alright, Frank. I'll be done shortly. You sure about that? Hey, you got a minute? Yeah, come with me. They were later discovered by a local group of ramblers last Sunday afternoon. - Get on the bus. Forensic investigators are now looking to determine the age of the remains. And their detectives are confident that they are related to the recent disappearances in the area. The investigation continues, and we will report on any further information as it comes through. That's the way to do it. That's the way to do it! So you like puppet shows? Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. Fine, it's fine. I just hate those things. What, puppets? So you like dragons. I don't think we're supposed to like dragons, are we? No, they're just misunderstood. The bad boys of mythology. But they're not, really. They just want to survive. You talk about them as if they're real. They are. They're also magical, powerful, and as old as time. He hasn't said anything to me or his mother, who has actually known him all his life. Has he ever said anything to you about Nashville? I don't even know where it is. And he doesn't like country and western. He said Dolly Parton is an abomination. I wanted Hawaii, and he knew that. Is this supposed to be a heart or a bum? I wish he'd stop booking things without talking to me about it first. Am I wrong here? Am I being selfish? It's not for me to say. Hawaii is a special place, and I've always had my- It's just a fucking holiday. Go or don't go, I don't care! Beth. Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean it. No, you're right. It's not important in the grand scheme of things, and we're very lucky. No Ally, please, it's me. I haven't been sleeping well. Don't know how to explain it. Try. I've never felt like this before. It's like I'm losing myself. Fading away, I can feel it, and it's getting worse. I think you're being a bit hard on yourself. It's only been a few months. We all miss Ken. And if we feel like that, then what must you be going through? What do you mean? What are you talking about? All I'm saying is, you need to give yourself time to grieve. You're bound to be forgetful. - Stop! Just stop. Where are we going, Frank? I want to show you something. What do you think? Is this somewhere you could see yourself living? No, I don't know... Are you okay? I have to go. Beth, wait. I really need to go. Alright, but let me come with you. I forgot. I forgot that he was dead. He isn't here anymore. I see him, Allyson, all the time. As clearly as I see you now. Last night, this morning... Oh Beth. Tell me I'm not losing my mind. Oh God! Don't be on your own. Ken? It's only me. Hello love. This is a surprise. Yeah, I was just down the road. Chest and back wax. Body builder, big baby. He blubbed all the way through it. I'll put the kettle on. Oh I'm okay, actually. Why don't you come to ours for dinner? Do you fancy a curry? You've been talking to Ally. She's worried about you. What's up? Mom? - Nothing. Just adjusting to being on my own. Your dad's still... He's still a presence in the house. I know. How's Connor? Yeah, he's good. We've been given notice to leave the flat. You know, you can always move in with me for a while. Both of you can. If you don't find somewhere. Oh thanks, mom. Something will turn up, it always does. We were offered a place today. It's way out of our price range. I'd help out, if I can. Oh, it's cool. We already turned it down. What's wrong? Needs a lot of work. Yeah, I suppose. Do you see yourselves living in the country? Maybe. I don't know, really. I don't really care where it is, as long as it's our own place. This will be all yours one day. Don't talk like that. Well none of us are here forever. Stop. Set, 9:30. Oh, bollocks. - How's that? - That's good. Oh, so is that. - That's it. More pressure? - Yeah. Oh you have some nasty knots there. Yeah. God, I needed this. - Oh that's it. That's it, you're done. Don't stop. Sit up, I want to talk to you. Oh, this don't sound good. I don't know if it is. Or at least, I think it is. Or, it could be. I think I may have found a way for us to afford that house. I told you before, we're not offing your mom. Would you just be serious for one second? Okay. This is my serious face. Oh I'm being very serious. I'm listening, tell me. Okay, you might not like it. But hear me out. Sweet dreams, eh love? Ken, do you believe in the coincidence between dreams and reality? No. I only ever used to have pleasant dreams. Why oh why do you always start to make conversations when I'm about to drop off? At least, I only remember the good ones. I was a happy kid, had a happy life. Oh yes. I did have one recurring nightmare. Kept coming back for a while. Goodnight. You don't want to know. It's stupid. I was chased by a Mr. Punch puppet. Sounds stupid, but it was really scary. It was. A great big hand, and red mottled face. Big nose and chin, grinning at me. That's what comes from eating too much cheese late at night. Go to sleep. I'm trying. Oh, mom. Oh, I'd wish you'd knock. Is that Earl Gray, with milk? See you tonight. Don't overdo it. Not a lot to do. Make sure she remembers to have some lunch. Yeah yeah yeah, look. I think you should unpack some boxes later. I'm beginning not to notice them. That's not good. What's your hurry? Won't be long. Where are you off to? A little exploring. Don't worry, I've got my phone if I get lost. Do you even know how to use that thing? Oh... It's quiet? I mean, the venue itself lends itself to it, but we'll be right in, sir. Different locations, aren't they? To be honest with you, it's totally up to you what you do with it. There once was a girl called Maude. We need to stop meeting around dragons. Have we met? Sorry, my memory's not what it used to be. Dragons are misunderstood. That. That was you. Although technically, it's not a dragon. It's a Wyvern. A Wyvern? I thought Wyvern House, where we live, I thought it must have been named after the river. You have a house named after a dragon? Impressive. I don't know about that. There's something about this place, this village, it's, it's like I've been here before. Maybe you have. It's possible. I've forgotten so many things. Why is that, do you think? Fuck you. Beth? What's wrong? Alright. Easy, yeah, I can't hear you too well. Where are you? Alright, look. Don't worry, I can find my phone you, okay? Just stay where you are. I'll be there soon as. Oh, fuck. Next time I expect you to be here to show them around. Yeah, I understand that. But you'll be making the best part of a tidy sum when they sell. I do not expect to have to do your job for you. Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. I don't know what his name was. He said you turned him. Well didn't you? I don't know. I don't know. Maybe he read a blurb in your window. Yeah, I'll tell him. Okay, yeah. Bollocks. Is that you, mate? Just been on to Prescott's Estate agents. They want you to get in touch. Probably... Hello? Beth? Come on, Dorothy. I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore. You walked all this way? Through fields? Suppose you didn't fly. Ass. You'll be hiding your own Easter eggs soon. Hilarious. You alright? I'm fine. I just lost my bearings. I feel very silly. You're a bit out of the way. I know. I was never very good at geography. Geography. Right. You know, what you did for us, we're so grateful. - Oh no, no. No, if you hadn't come in with us on the house, we'd never been able to afford it. I know you didn't like the place at first. It was just a bit strange at first, that's all. It's okay now. We all miss him, you know. Do you remember that summer? We did that barbecue. He made his famous burgers. God, they were disgusting. Yeah, proper rank. It was good though, wasn't it? It really was. It really was. The church. Connor, please, I need to check on something. - Anybody home? - No, no one's here. Yoohoo, Beth? We did say one o'clock, didn't we? It's 20 past. Maybe she thought we weren't coming. Where's the bedroom? More like she's forgot. Either way, where's the bloody money? Maybe she's locked herself in the attic. Like Anne Frank. Have you tried calling her? Straight to answering machine. It's bigger than I thought. It will look lovely when it's finished. Have they got a cat? There's a slash. I'm gonna piss myself. Here, kitty kitty... I couldn't believe it when I saw it. Isn't it amazing? Yeah. Hello. You took your time. Oh, tell me you didn't do a number two. I see you're interested in our dragon. I assume you know the tale. The creature was found when it was very young. By a girl called Maude. She fed it. She loved it. It grew up. Got fed up on a diet of milk and vegetables. Started to steal local cattle and sheep. It got a taste for meat. It angered the farmers, who attempted to destroy it. But of course, inevitably, they sealed their own fate and marched to their death. Some say the local squire's son killed it. Others say, That it never left. It stays, hidden, waiting patiently, in the darkness of Wyvern Hill. Oh, wet feet. Ham and coleslaw Sammy and a cuppa? Yeah, I'll do it. No, let me. It's the least I can do. Okay, thanks. You know. It's great waking up to a mug of tea on the bedside table every morning, but you really don't need to do that. Point taken. You're not here to look after us. Yes, but, I hope you don't mind me asking. But who are you? Fair one. You do think we did the right thing moving mom in with us, don't you? I think so, yeah. Thanks. You know, not every guy would agree to move in with his girlfriend and his girlfriend's mom. Well, she's a good egg. She really likes you. She needs to see someone, though. Well I told her about the morning tea business. Oh, what did she say? Yeah, she got it. Oh, brilliant. You'll be making the tea from now on. Oh will I, now? Know your place. Mom, what's wrong? What's the matter? It was walking across the bed, it was on me! What was? Nothing. It was nothing. I'm so sorry. What did you see, mom? What was your nightmare about? It was silly. It was a nightmare I used to have as a kid. You'd laugh if I told you. I want to help you, but I don't know what to do. I should see my doctor. I'm frightened. We'll be here for you, okay? Whatever happens, we'll get you through this. Ah, for fuck's sakes. Oh! For fuck's sakes! No no. No, it's not that sort of emergency. I've already explained. It's for my mom, not for me. That's the best you can do? Really? Yes. That's fine, yeah. Thank you. 27th, 9:00 am. That's the earliest we can get you an appointment. Two weeks. It's fine. I can wait. It doesn't look like we've got much choice. Are you gonna be okay? I'm not completely dotty yet. Oh, well don't say that. Well, you know what I mean. Look, have some rest today. Love you. Daft girl. I love you, too. In a paper kit, going in and making it different colors. And you know, even though you've got that- Fucking hell. Kill me now. Oh, what the hell? Oh, oh... Oh god! Hi, it's Sue. Leave a message. Hi Sue, it's Beth. This is awful, I don't know how I could've missed you. Please call me when you get this message. Thanks, I'll try Jeff. - Hi, it's Jeff. - Oh Jeff. Please leave a message. I've just left a message with Sue. I'm coming 'round in an Uber. Please, please call me. Lots of love, Beth. It's Beth! Hi, it's Sue. Leave a message. Sue, it's Beth again. Please ring me. Not in. Oh, hello. Do you know where they've gone? I don't, sorry. I haven't seen them since yesterday. What? Yeah, I've been in all the time. They left around 12:00, half 12:00. Haven't been back since. Poor old George, bless him, he's been barking all night. I was actually going to go check in on him. Have you got a key? Oh George, there you are. There's a good boy. Hello? Hello? They're definitely not in. You can tell when a house is empty. What did you just say? You can tell when a house is empty? Yes. Yes you can. We were just... You were just having a conflab about me. You're worried about me, I get it. Beth, we were just having some us time. We need to talk. This is important. You think I'm in the early stages of dementia. Well, I might be. That I probably am. I forget things, I imagine things, but I'm not mad. I don't make you cups of tea in the morning, I never have. Fruit bowls don't smash by themselves and sweep up their shards. I found a piece of glass on the kitchen floor. It cut me. I didn't imagine that. Slow down! Something very strange is going on. Somebody's determined to make me think I'm nuts. - Of course they are. - Who? I don't know. I haven't thought about it. Sue and Jeff are missing. - What? Yesterday, God, it must have been when we were out. I found an envelope with some money in it. They're repaying a loan month by month, never mind. Sue had written on the envelope the date, and sorry to miss you kind of thing. They haven't been back home since. What are you saying? Something's happened to them? - Yes. No, I don't know, but something weird is going on. They haven't been back to their house. The dog was left alone overnight. They love that dog, like a kid. There could be any number of reasons why that might have happened. Yes, and none of them good. And Connor, I would never just barge into your bedroom without your permission. Least of all to leave you a cup of tea. Even if I was losing it, I wouldn't do that. So what are you saying? We've got a ghost butler. Hey, you can cut the attitude, no. Something is going on. Hi, it's Sue. Leave a message. Night night. Connor. Ken, Ken! Hello, sweetheart. Come back to bed. Who the hell are you? You know who I am. That's the way to do it. That's the way to do it. That's the way to do it. That's the way to do it. Connor! You're going to miss the finale, Beth! Where's your phone? I left it in my room. We can't leave Connor! - We have to! We need to get out of here. - Who are they, mom? - I don't know! Where's the key? Where are you? He's coming, Beth! Hey. Rectal reject. That's the way to do it, Mr. Punch. Isn't that right, Beth? That's the way to do it. Listen to me. Just run, don't worry about me. I won't be far behind you. Get to Frank's farm, call for help. I'm not leaving without you. I said go! Beth. Beth. I'm ready for you. Who are you? There once was a girl. Called Maude. There once was a girl called Maude. Who picked up a strange creature. And brought it to her home. You need to be strong now, for our daughter. Open your eyes. Finally, you are awake. Beth. My Beth. See, Beth. See. Now, now we dance. That's the way to do it. That's the way to do it. That's the way to do it. No, no! That's the way to do it. That's the way to do it. That's the way to do it. That's the way to do it. That's the way to do it. That's the way to do it. That's the way to do it. That's the way to do it. That's the way to do it. Nice work, Mr. Punch. Surprise! Oh! You have front row tickets. Why are you doing this? Now Beth. Don't you just love the randomness of it all? We did all this for you. We've listened to everything. You like dragons. I don't think we're supposed to like dragons. So lost. So perfect. The one we had always been looking for. The raw material that artists can only hope for once in a lifetime. You see, Beth. We did all of this for you. You, Beth. You are our masterpiece! Now. Smile for the audience. Take your bow. It's alright, love. Let go. You don't have to see this. Let go, come home. Beth. And now, for the grand finale. Please don't do this. No! Yes. Yes. Remember that Summer, Beth. Poof. And she's gone. Truly, beautiful.
