Can you see it? Take your time. Congratulations, Father. Uh huh. A week late, but there she is. Eight months in the African ports but, he's come back to you now. Thank you. You see him, Mercedes? Monsieur Morrell. Yes, dear girl. The flag's at half mast. Fernand, what can it be? Edmund, my dear boy. I am glad to see you. But what does the flag mean? Where is Captain Leclere? We have had a tragedy at sea, monsieur. The captain died off Chiba Dubeki, sir, Of brain fever. Leclere? Dead? Buried at sea, sir. And the cargo? All safe, sir. I think you'll find Everything to you satisfaction, Monsieur Morrell. You've done well. After the misfortune, who took charge, you? You know, sir, scarcely was the breath out Of the good captain's body then Monsieur Dantes assumed command without consulting anybody. As captain's mate, it was my duty to take command, sir. You did well, my boy, very well. Next to a death at sea, Edmond, do less is insignificant. But were there any other incidents which should Be brought to my attention? Yes, sir, one. Bring the prisoner forward. Caderousse? Four days ago, during the burial ceremony, he was Caught pilfering stores in the forecastle. True, Caderousse? Have you now added petty thievery to your Other accomplishments? If the almighty, Monsieur Dantes, says so, then I'm a thief. Shall we turn him over to the police? I wouldn't imprison any man used to the Freedom of the seas, sir. But, I’d not have him on my ship. Your ship, young man? - I spoke... - As acting captain, I know. And as such, what are your orders. You're free, Caderousse, but don't show your face to me again. You must stop being so generous to the world, Monsieur Dantes, God will get jealous. Father, Danglars tells me that on the way home The ship put in at Elba. Elba? Why Elba? My ships have no business at Elba. Captain's orders, sir. And the captain was the Only man to go ashore. Why? Could it be that he had some business with Napoleon? He didn't tell me the purpose of his visit to the island, sir. Strange. Very strange. Did he leave any papers behind? A will? A testament? On his deathbed, sir, he gave me this. There's no address on it. He told me where to delivery it, sir. I have his full instructions. Well, the matter will take care of itself. - Edmond. Huh? Ahaa. Well, we must talk to you no longer. Go, my boy, a far more important personage than old Morrell is waiting for you. Go. Mercedes. Hey, another member of this club. What club? The society for the destruction of Edmond Dantes. You would like that, wouldn't you lieutenant? Wouldn't you like a clear path to Your pretty little cousin, Mercedes. Don't mention Mercedes name in your pub. Sit down. Please. Hold it. Be quiet. Listen to me. Heh. I think I see a way to remove this impediment From the lives of all of us. Question: what is the fate of a Bonapartist In these marching times? He's a...Bonapartist? On the way home, our ship put in at Elba. The captain went ashore. Two days later, before he died, he handed Dantes an envelope. - So? - So use your imagination. I'm suggesting that captain Leclere went ashore to consort with Napoleon Bonaparte himself. I'm suggesting that Envelope contains secret orders. I'm proposing that we take advantage of the possibilities in this situation. Wake up. Hey paper, ink! One moment monsieur. Please, just a moment. Edmond. Yes, father. I'm an old man without manners, but I must ask Miss Higgins a question. What is it? That young lieutenant, your cousin, Fernand Mandego, I'm told he loves you, too. Fernand Mandego has loved and lost. The way of the world, father. Fernandi is a fiery young man. A Spaniard. I do not want you coming at you one dark night, With that long knife. My blade is a match for any Spaniard knife. But... Father, this is no time for bad thoughts. We have good news for you tonight. Yes, tell him now. Now, Mandego I think you'd better write it. Mine is too fine a hand. Ha, ha, this requires Something a little rougher. Uh, address it, uh,... The Prosecutor, the Port of Marseille. The Prosecutor, uh, begin as follows, uh, Monsieur. A captain? Yes, I’ve been made captain. With a hundred gold sovereigns paid per voyage and a share of the profits. My boy, my boy! Tell him the rest. With the first money I touch, i mean you to have A house of your own, with a garden, To plant your larkspur, your roses, your flowering vines... - What do you see? Oh, nothing. Nothing. May I now pronounce you man and wife. Now, when I say those words, tomorrow, The groom will kiss the bride. Oh, not now, tomorrow, I said. At wedding tomorrow. Now, the organ will began again, And you will take her by the arm And lead here up the aisle, out of the church. Do it, do it, do it. Now then family and friends will turn and follow them up the aisle. No, no, tomorrow, I said. Not today. Tomorrow, tomorrow, i said. ...tomorrow. For the wedding. Don't forget! Ha, ha, ha. Edmond Dantes! That's my name, monsieur. You're under arrest! What's the meaning of this? What is my offence? Edmond! Oh, what is happening. Take your hands off her! Don't touch her! You are the mate of the Argus? - Yes, Monsieur le Prosecutor. You don't seem to be dressed for a conspiracy. Conspiracy? I was arrested at the rehearsal for my wedding. Tomorrow, I’m to be married. Have you ever served under the usurper, Bonaparte? Bonaparte? Bonaparte, what are you saying, monsieur? I don't... It is reported that your political affinities are extremist. Affinities, Monsieur De Villefort all I know Is my work. I love the sea. I love my fiancé. I love my father. These are my affinities. If they are political than They are, as you say, sir, extremist. I believe that. Do you recognize this writing? No, sir. Are you sure? Is it true? No sir. Did your captain give you an envelope? Yes, sir. Where is it? I carry it with me. Give it to me. I gave him my word, sir. I order you, in the name of the king to give it to me. In the name of the king, of course. What does it say, monsieur. Had you known the contents of this letter, You wouldn't be carrying it on your person. You would have denied any knowledge of it When I asked for it. As you actually surrendered it to me, It clearly establishes your innocence of any Complicity in this affair. Then...if I am innocent, monsieur.. You may go back to your bride-to-be. God bless you, Monsieur De Villefort. Oh, one more thing. Yes, monsieur. I see no address on the envelope. I was told when and where to deliver it. When? Tonight, sir. To what address? 15 Avenue Montaigne. To any particular person there? Yes, sir, a Monsieur Noirtier. Say the name once more. François de Noirtier. Is that all, monsieur? May I go... No, no. There are a few more questions. Do you know this person? This Noirtier? Oh, no sir. Have you spoken his name to anyone? To no one but you, sir. Good. I am sorry to tell you this, but I cannot dismiss you right now. Why not, monsieur? Yours is a political arrest. I must detain you overnight. That is the law, unfortunately. You will be dismissed in the morning. I guarantee it. You see, the principal charge against you Is this letter. Without the letter, there is no evidence against you, whatsoever. Monsieur De Villefort, you are a good man. Now listen carefully, should anyone interrogate you, You don't speak a word about this letter. No, sir, I will not. And you have never heard the name of Noirtier. Never! Splendid. You will be taken to the Palais de Justice Just for the night, so don't worry. It is only a formality. Take him. Noirtier. Noirtier. Must that name pursue me like a demon to my grave? Pardon, monsieur, this is not the way to the Palais de Justice... Monsieur, in the name of mercy, where are you taking me? I'll give you in the name of mercy good advice...close your mouth. Monsieur De Villefort told me we were to go to the... Young man, always follow good advice... Good evening, Monsieur Noirtier. What the devil... You were expecting a messenger. But not you. That's impossible. Me, no, no. To put the circumstance In a nutshell, your messenger was intercepted, father. And the message. Destroyed. Sit down. The paper was destroyed. The message is now written In here...written in fact, names, dates, places. All the little details of you precious little Emperor's intended escape from Elba. I have no intention of telling it to you. Nice to see you, my son. Nice to see you, father. I know you would never betray your comrades, But betray them, you will, if you don't do exactly As I say. For I will then reveal all their names To the police. Always the cunning devil. Ever the selfish little beast. You have been my secret embarrassment ever since I started my public career. My own father, a follower of Napoleon. I have lived with the fear of discovery long enough. Your days in this foolish cause are now over. From now on, you will never be out of my sight. Indeed, you come with me to Paris, tonight. To Paris? Yes, yes, it seems I have news for his majesty's government. Uh, don't worry, I will give no names involved in the escape. Only the facts. They should be enough, I think, to astonish The bureaucracy of Paris, and bring me to the attention Of the king, himself. You will soon be the father of an important man. Doesn't that...please you? It should. You're not taking me there! Help! Help.....! - You there, keep quiet! Where am i? Tell me where I am. - My friend, you are now in residence at the Chateau D'if. There's been a mistake. I was ordered to the Palais de Justice. It was Monsieur De Villefort orders. Send for Monsieur de Villefort. - Would you like me to send for the king as well, or the queen? Come back. Monsieur De Villefort is my friend. He will be very angry. Come back! At least take a letter... To my wife. What have I done? What is my crime? Breakfast. Listen to me a moment. Just one moment. Tell me, how can i arrange to see the warden? Someday. Someday? But I’m to be released today...today! M. De Villefort's orders. - And who is m. de Villefort? Mercedes. Ha, ha, ha. Hungry yet, monsieur? Are do we starve one more day? Wait. Wait. Ahhh. Nasty little stomach. Winds over to night lite once again? Very well. Hello! Hello. Are you a prisoner? Can you hear me? - Who are you? Edmond Dantes. - Why are you here? They said I was a Bonapartist. - How long have you been here? I don't know. I was imprisoned on 28 Feb., 1815. - Ten years. How long have you been here? - I will push the stone from this side. I am the Abbe Faria. Born in italy. Raised a priest in Italy I've been in this place since eighteen hundred and ten. Fifteen years. The glorious wisdom of the political world, Monsieur Dantes, you're here because they said You were with Bonaparte, I was imprisoned for being against him. Five years ago I laid my plans for escape. My calculations took me a year. To make the necessary tools took me a year. I've been digging for three years. Three years. I had but one mathematical instrument, this one. Now I find it was guilty of an inaccuracy. I took this wall for the sea wall of the prison. I calculated 40 degrees instead of 50. You were digging for the sea wall? Uhh. Come with me. Ahh. My mallet. Chisel. Where did you get them? I made them. What is this? In simple terms, it means a quarter past 12 o'clock. A clock. A clock, a calendar, an astronomical chart. Here, I will show you. My book. My....needle, made from a fishbone, Like my chisel made from one of the irons in my bedstead, Like my pincers, and my knife and my lamp. - A lamp needs oil. - Which I make from the suet from the meat they give us on holy days. How do you light your lamp? Oh, I claim to have a skin disease. I sometimes ask for sulphur. To relieve the pain. From which i replenish my match. Haaa. Um. Now. All this talent for my hope and salvation. Now my dead hope. Five years spent on a tunnel that leads not to freedom, but to another man's cell. Abbe Faria, listen, your tunnel runs in the same direction as the outer gallery. Yes. The sea wall is here, I can just glimpse it from my window. Half your tunnel runs in the right direction. From the center point we turned, you call it 50 degrees. I say two points more north by northeast, and dig to the sea wall about a hundred meters. Half my tunnel runs in the right direction? How long will it take? Two of us, four years. And while we work, will you teach me, All the things you know? Yes. Mathematics, theology, philosophy, living languages - And dead languages. The history of the world. I give thanks to heaven. I'll be able to teach once more. - Edmond, for today's lesson in philosophical logic, - Let's ply our brains in some deductive thinking in the case - Of Edmond Dantes. First, to whom could your imprisonment, your disappearance, have been of some benefit? Consider, you were about to be appointed captain of the Argus. To whom would that position go - if you suddenly vanished? Danglars. Item: who would Mercedes turn to were Edmond Dantes - suddenly to vanish? Mondego. Item: one night you saw Danglars and Mondego in a - Cafe writing,... with? - Caderousse! Could they have been writing the letter that accused you, - these three? - Danglars, Mondego, Caderousse! You were examined by the prosecutor of the port, who was very sympathetic. He burned the letter which was addressed to a Noirtier. Noirtier. Noirtier, I knew a person of that name at the court Of the Queen of Etruria, an ardent disciple of Napoleon. Edmond, what was your prosecutor called? De Villefort. Duh! Hah! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. What did I say? You have unlocked the whole mystery. My friend, at the court of Etruria the most ardent Bonapartist I've ever known. His name was Noirtier De Villefort. His brother? No, my age. His father! I presume so. His own father a Bonapartist? So, he destroys your letter,... And me. - And you. Pray God! Mondego! Sometimes I regret that I helped him discover the truth. I see too much in his face that was never there before. Mondego. Mondego! Vengeance belongs to the lord, Edmond. Turn away from such unholy thoughts before they destroy you. Caderousse! De Villefort! Danglers! Ummm. Ummm. Edmond. Edmond. Dear God, what is it? Edmond, Im ill. I'm dying. You must live. I'll finish the tunnel, myself. Edmond, you must finish the tunnel and escape. Find the treasure. Treasure? A map. Of the Island of Monte Cristo. This is the lost map of Chezure's father, with who's death in 1498 vanished one of the great treasures of the world. This fortune has been buried on monte cristo for Three and a half centuries. Oh, Edmond, I wanted us to find this treasure together. Now it is for you to find alone. Do great charitable deeds with this. spend this fortune, which God has been hoarding for you, in good and holy ways. Edmond, you must escape and find the treasure. My profession forbade me to marry, so you are my son, the child of my captivity. Make thy works of goodness a memorial to me. What is such treasure to me? My real treasure lies here. You have enriched me beyond... Ah! Ohhhhhh! Yeah, he's done all right. The poor old lunatic. I'll get the sack. Well, now we wait for the tide to change. Come on. He's heavy Here. - He's half dead. - No, he's half alive. - Wake up, old man. - How do you know that, Isolde? Look at him. Where am i? Aboard the good ship Lagorna, out of Corsica. I am the captain. Bertuccio, is my name. This is my mate, Jacopo. Haa. What are you? Huh? What is you name? Where do you go? The island of Rheon. With a top two current, it should take us there In two hours. You know these waters, eh? Bertuccio, Jacopo, what are Italians doing in these waters? I think you already guessed. How is the smuggling these days, good? Terrible. We need a navigator. A navigator who know his way in this jungle of waters. Would you, would you join us? Now, tell me, who are you? What is you name? Where do you come from? There's no sign of a ship wreck. There's been no storm. The cannon of Chateau D'if. - You? - Jacopo. On this boat, a man's business is his business. You have a young man's face. How old are you? - If this is the year 1829, is it? - Of course Then I am 33 years old. And I will be 34 years old. Only because of you, my good friends. The priest was there. Well. He said she is married. To Mondego? To Fernand Mondego. And? Tell me. I don't know why i must be the one to tell. Your father is dead. And Edmond, this burns in my throat, of starvation. Your father died of starvation. Danglars! De Villefort! Caderousse! Mondego! God had delivered me into the hands of two smugglers, who breathed life back into me. Befriended me on faith alone, asking no questions, until the day I was strong enough to fulfill my promise to the Abbey Faria. The entire part of fortune is buried on Monte Cristo. It's been there for three and a half centuries. Oh Edmond, I wanted us to find this treasure together. Now it is for you to find alone. Do great and charitable deeds with this. Spend this fortune, which God has been hoarding for you, in good and holy ways. Was I only humoring fancies of a beloved madman? By coming to the island of Monte Cristo Was I simply laying the spirit of the Abbey To eternal rest? Or was there a hope in my heart of hearts, That his map would truly be the end of the rainbow. Oh, Abbey Faria, dear priest, dear saint! I promise you by the God I had for so long forsaken. I promise you we will build your hospitals and house your orphans. I promise you there will be a flood of good things in a hundred abandoned corners of the earth, and all in your name. And I promise you, Edmond Dantes, imprisoned in the prime of life, banished from the world for fourteen years. I promise you, Edmond Dantes, you shall have your revenge. Jacopo! Bertuccio! The world is mine! Hooray! (Years later, Edmond Dantes had been transformed) He did say a quarter after the hour? He did, Baron Danglers. Such panache! He takes the most splendid castle in the whole of the landscape of France. Such abandoned expense. Ho, ho, my word. How the man spends. Such mystery! All these rumors of a hareem on the top of his castle. These whispers about a fleet of pirate ships drowning the Mediterranean. How did he contact the bank? I was approached by his equerry, sir. A rough looking fellow with a terrible scar. Nerve! Ha, ha, typical. An equerry with a scar. He has all the trappings of the exotic. Mystery clings to him like scandal. What an aura of legend he's spread around Europe In the last five years. His own intelligence network, with tentacles around the world. A whole army of agents, ceaselessly questing, Questing, Questing, questing for what? Earth? Nobody knows. And this Pasha of mystery, this Mycenus from nowhere, Is coming to see me? Ha, ha. What time is my appointment with the prosecutor? Not until eleven, monsieur. What is it? The Count of Monte Cristo. What, show him in! My, dear Count. I am the Baron Danglers. Sit down. Do sit down there, Monsieur de Comte. Baron Danglers, I came to Paris intending to stay only a month. I've since decided to stay on another two or three. - Paris will be proud... - I've been banking out of my pocket, thus far. Now I wish to open an account with your establishment. As an opening account shall we say,... 5 million. Oh, the power of little pieces of paper, my dear Baron. - He, he, he, he,.... - As marvelous any Creation of man, including his poetry, music and painting. Who handles money properly, is also an artist. Yes...yes. Five. - Well, monsieur, I shall take, uh... - The balance I leave to my staff. I thank you, Baron. Monsieur le Comte. I am impressed by your head of Imhotep, sir. A fine specimen. Im...uh...Hotep, yes, oh, and this one, sir. A most ingenious fake. All right, thank you. Oh, thank you, thank you, indeed, sir. Is there any other service we can render in the meantime, Some convenience, uh... In point of fact, Baron. Whatever the count of Monte Cristo may desire. I make my home in the country, monsieur. Yes, I know. But, now, for convenience, i've taken an apartment On the Champs Elysee. I'm told there have been random robberies in the neighborhood. For police protection to whom does one apply? And all papers in the case should be consigned To the king's attorney. - At once, Monsieur de Villefort. - Thank you. The Baron Danglers. Danglers, you are late. Monsieur de Villefort, i have the honor to present The Count of Monte Cristo. The Count of Monte Cristo, my dear count, Welcome to my house. Monsieur. Please, sit down. I hope i'm not intruding on the business of the day. Intruding? Not at all. A minor matter. All dispatched with. Surely, you've been reading About this cutthroat, Hacques Bienoir, who killed the brother of senator Gallimar. Yes. Has a judgment been reached? Indeed, the guillotine. If a man tortures and murders your brother or you son or your father, kills one of those beings who leave an eternal emptiness, and a bleeding wound when they are torn from your heart, do you really think society has given you sufficient reparation because the blade of a guillotine has passed between the murder's trapezious and his occipital bone? Because the man who has caused you immeasurable suffering has endured a few seconds of physical pain? My dear count, are you suggesting the medieval way, Torture? I am suggesting the holy remedy. An eye for an eye. Yes. Yes, indeed, indeed. Very interesting. Ha, well, uh, when the count mentioned to me that he was seeking police protection for his residence, I took the liberty... This office it at his service of the Count of Monte Cristo. We can post police officials on both streets of his residence, front and rear. As many as you may desire. Monsieur de Villefort is too generous. Paris must do its very best for distinguished visitors. Father, you promised to come and see grandfather, this morning. The morning is half gone. You know his rest. Good morning, Baron Danglers. Good morning, sir. How long will you... you know he must need a nap. When do you have such visitors, father? This gentleman doesn't look like a criminal or a lawyer. I'm afraid my daughter is outspoken to a fault. And slightly ill-mannered. Please, forgive her. - Father. - Valentine, I have the honor to present the Count of Monte Cristo. Monte Cristo! Oh, sir, i shall be the envy of every girl in paris. What they're saying is true. You are handsome. Are you as rich as they say, monsieur? Rich in experience, mademoiselle. Rich in years. And growing richer by the moment in my appreciation of the loveliness of paris. Monsieur, are you busy? Do me the greatest of favors. Will you come to meet my grandfather? - Valentine, will you stop this nonsense? He will brighten like the lilies. Come. Mademoiselle honors me. The Count of Monte Cristo. How extraordinary. But how did you manage to bring him here? As a matter of fact, it wasn't easy. Grandfather, I bring you the Count of Monte Cristo. Here, you see how he smiles. Amidst all kinds of ..... And I bring him to your room. Monsieur le Comte, my grandfather, Monsieur de Noirtier de Villefort. Honored, monsieur. My grandfather is paralyzed, monsieur From an old would at Austerlitz. He can speak only with his eyes. What is it you want, Grandfather? Another pillow? Some water? A, b, c, d, e, f, g G. Valois, he wants his glasses. He's delighted to see you. Are you not, Grandfather? What other man which do we need? Valois, is it time to start his meal? My grandfather is a prisoner of his body, monsieur. But his will is like his mind, unconquerable. He possesses what few men can boast of, the devotion of one loving heart. That's a lonely statement, monsieur. Monsieur Albert is here, mademoiselle. Albert! Oh, monsieur, please. I shall return immediately. You must excuse me, sir, if I seem to stare. It doesn't often happen that a man can gaze upon the one great nemesis of his life. Don't strain for explanations, monsieur. It is now my turn to leave you with a mystery, Until the day I explain myself to your son. Monsieur le Comte, may I present Albert Mondego. Monsieur. It is a great honor. You honor me, monsieur. All Paris speaks of you, monsieur. Good morning, monsieur. All Paris yearns to shake the hand of the mysterious stranger. And here you are shaking that hand straight from his arm. The city's on fire, monsieur, with talk, talk, talk, about The Count of Monte Cristo. Now control yourself. My father, monsieur, even my father's caught up in the game. Um...he says you're an oriental. But he says he met you in Turkey. Because..Um..Because my father was ambassador to the king of Venir. Uh..Surely you have heard of my father? The Count Mondego. Who has not heard of the great general, Fernand Mondego? A man i've always wanted to meet. My dear count, I'm the father of Albert. General. My son astonishes me. I had not idea he had reached so high in the social scale. It is I who am scaling the heights, monsieur. Who has not heard of the great exploits on the battlefield of general Mondego? My dear count. Monsieur le Compte, may I present my mother, the Countess Mondego. Oh, monsieur, my son is still a child who plays childish games. He tells me we have a visitor and he refuses to give me his name. He says I should be delightfully surprised. We have not met before, have we, monsieur? Who do I have the honor of addressing, monsieur. Your servant, madame. The Count of Monte Cristo. You saw her? She knew you? She thinks she knows me. But she refuses to believe what she thinks. And when she does believe it? It will be too late, Princess. We shall move like the Sword of the Lord, With a terrible swiftness. Do you love her, still? No. She cannot influence you? She cannot dissuade you? Answer me, please. No power in heaven or earth can dissuade me. No angel, no demon, could keep me from my revenge. Good, my lord, good. Remember, your revenge is my revenge. Allevo Mondego papers. Villefort. We have only to hear from the doctor. Danglers. We have all the documents, master. Good. The public sees Villefort as the loving father, devoted son, the faithful watchdog of the law. Danglers, is the financial wizard, advisor to great fortunes, the lion who guards the nation's wealth. Mondego is the great war hero. Favorite of the boulevards. Affectionately called the peacock for his many decorations. Well, we know Villefort is a wolf, Danglers a pig, Mandego a hyena, And we're finally ready to go hunting. Good, very good. The wrist, the wrist. Good, very good. You are the master, now. I am the pupil. Put it back. We've had a devil of a time finding you. People usually do. Six years ago, you were sentenced to the galleys The charge was smuggling. Escaped from the galleys. Caught. Sentenced to life in the galleys. You escaped again. Read on. I find myself fascinating. You've been a thief, smuggler, embezzler, possibly an assassin, During the course of which you've learned to speak fluent Italian. Perfecto, seigneur. From now on you are Andrea, the count of Cavalcante. Am i? You are the son of Major Bartolomeo de Cavalcante, A descendent of the Cavalcante whose names are inscribed In the golden book of Florence. You are very rich. Good! I spend a lot of money, of course. Of course. You will take apartments, which I have selected for you On the Fauborg. You will have three servants. You will purchase a carriage. Go to Batiste for it. The horse is from Debideux. You will pay court to a beautiful young girl. I wish you to do it expensively. For the next few weeks, when you are not with her, you will be seen everywhere with me. Ah, the count accompanies the count. Precisely. Now, what is your name? The Count of Cavalcante. The Count of Monte Cristo. So glad you could come. It is a pleasure to see you, dear count. May I present my friend, the Count of Cavalcante, Whom you were gracious enough to include in your invitation. Any friend of Monte Cristo. May I present my daughter, Valentine. Mademoiselle. Monsieur le Compte. Cavalcante's in Paris on family business. And leave his wife in Italy? He's unmarried. Oh. Have you known him long? But a few days. He came to me with letters of introduction from my brokers in Rome. I know his family, of course. All of Italy knows the Cavalcante, who were rich when the Medici were peasant stock. ...Signorina, I would be deeply grateful... Your daughter's fiancé does not take exception? But, my daughter has no fiancé. She's not engaged to Albert Mondego? Not at all. Not at all. They are only friends. My dear count. M. Danglars, I wish to purchase a newspaper, Le Journal de Globe, I am told it's for sale. I rather fancy owning a newspaper. Please arrange for its purchase. Very good, I approve, every man of affairs should own a newspaper. Second, I wish to buy some Spanish government bonds. In what amount of purchase, sir? One million. I...in...uh...Spanish bonds? Can the purchase be effected immediately? Eh, immediately, sir. And confidentially. With the utmost discretion. It would not be wise for anyone to follow my lead in the market. I'm a gambler, not an investor. Good day, Baron, tomorrow i leave for London on business. Give my regards to that fascinating city. Though the English will never learn how to eat. - There are places. As you and I know, my dear, Baron. Money can buy anything. Anything. - Girard! Girard! Make out an order for a million in spanish bonds For the Count of Monte Cristo. Spanish? And for myself one million. For my private account. Baron, Spanish bonds... When Monte Cristo buys, I buy. Have you forgotten the result when we followed his lead the last time? Does he know that you... Contact our most important portfolio, sir, inform them De Livier, and...uh.. Beaufort, that the house Of Danglars recommends heavy investment in Spanish bonds. Well, do it! - Now! the Count of Monte Cristo. Is this your semaphore station? Mine? I work it. I've done for many years, but I never have any visitors. How does it work? There's another one on the far horizon. That's my right-hand correspondent. And there is my left hand. When I receive a message, from right I transmit it to left. thus, our messages from Spain transmitted all the way To Paris in a matter of hours. A modern miracle. Three thousand francs, five years pay, if you relay This message to Paris. But...this is...not official. You insult me, sir. It is an insult. Impossible. It is the official telegraph service, sir. King Don Carlos has invaded spain through the Catalonian frontier. Civil war is in force! Civil war! What will happen to Spanish bonds? If I may suggest it, sir. Suggest! Suggest! A quick sell-out, the quicker the better. That's it. Yes. Sell every bond, now! The moment the exchange opens, sir. My reputation, the reputation of my bank! I invest my clients money in civil wars and cataclysms! I'll not have a client left tomorrow. You have another suggestion, have you? Yes, make good all losses. Yes. From the banks reserves. From your own. You're insane. I can place the order to sell now, monsieur. What is it you want of me? A little of your time, for which you'll be paid. I am your servant, sir. You name is Caderousse. It is my real name. How did you know? You spent seven years of your life in his majesty's galleys. You made one attempt to escape. Yes. And if it were not for - A certain person... - You had a companion in your escape. He played you false. Faustino. My life is dedicated to one purpose, Find him, and kill him! Revenge is a sweet thing to live for, or die for. Sir, I have other pressing business, which should take only a moment. Would it inconvenience you to wait outside? I am you servant, sir. - Monsieur. - Monsieur. Faustino! Faustino, God is sometimes good. From what black hole in hell, did you come back to life? From the Cul-de-Sac in which you let me die. Oh! Oh! Aw! Did you see? He attacked me. What could I do? Take him to the police. You know this man? Who are you, Monte Cristo? Who are you? Take him away. One. He is not of the house of Cavalcante! - His name is Benedetto. His most recent name, that is. - He is a notorious escaped criminal. And he wants to marry my daughter. He doesn't lack nerve, I must say. He is an escaped galley slave, among other offences. Duped! He has duped us all, sergeant including the infallible Monte Cristo. A Cavalcante indeed. This upstart, this rabbit. He has insulted my very person, which compels me to prosecute this case myself. In fact, it becomes a moral duty. Last rites, huh? I have not been tried, yet. Please, go away. Andrea de Cavalcante? Go away. Faustino. You? My blessed protector. Will you protect me From the guillotine, huh? You won't be convicted if you do as I say. Memorize the first page entirely. Familiarize yourself with all the other documents. I will be in the courtroom. Keep your eyes on me. So this man, Andrea Benedetto, Faustino, he assumes a new name for each fresh transgression, - is no simple rascal, no petty scoundrel. - He is a serpent of subtlety. A giant of cunning. But now, this murderer, has been caught in the act, With the weapon in his hand. Gloating over the fallen body of his victim. So you can pass only one verdict on the disposition Of this miserable creature. Death! Order in the court. Order. Order. Accused, rise. Accused, your name and surname. Monsieur le President, i will give my name last of all. Let's proceed. - Your age. I am 21 years old. I was born on the night of the 27th of september, 1817. - Where were you born? At Autoreille, near Paris. - Your vocation? Oh, I am a professional man, A forger, thief, on occasion an assassin. - Have you a request, Monsieur de Villefort? - Questions from the bench have been completed. - All but one. - Now, prisoner, now. Will you consent - to say your name? - Your true name. I do not know it. But I know my father's name. - Then repeat your father's name. My father is the king's prosecutor. - What did you say? His name is de Villefort. Order, order. Silence. Silence. In the year, 1817, M. de Villefort rented a house, at 28, Rue de la Fontaine in the village of Auteuille. His purpose, to keep there, hidden from polite society, a young woman. After a year of secret residence in Auteuille. the young woman, to Villefort's exasperation Gave birth to an infant son. Hours after the birth, the mother died. That very night, Villefort took the son, wrapped it in a cloth and buried it alive in the garden of the house. The burial, M. Le president, was witnessed from an upper window of the house by a servant. It was he who disinterred the body, discovering it was still alive. He fought with Cadmille to a foundling home. At the age of 13, I ran away from the home, and embarked upon the distinguished career which has finally brought me, M. le President, to this court. The lease on the house in the Feuer, signed by M. de Villefort. The death certificate of the mademoiselle of the League of Cours signed by the politori of Auteuille A certificate from the same doctor testifying that M. de Villefort was the father of the child. The physicians, testaments court statements, etc., etc., etc.,.... Two In this morning's paper. It might be advisable, sir. No. - What is it there? No. No. No. No. No. No. No! Listen, monsieur, I... it is without foundation That the Journal de Globe yesterday announced a revolt in Spain. A telegraphic signal, improperly interpreted, owing to the fog, was the cause of this error. There was no invasion. There is no war. Spain...is at peace! Danglars, ah, you have seen the paper. You know what's happening. Is that why you so magnanimously made good our losses? So you could buy up our bonds. But, gentlemen, I've sold my bonds, too. I swear it! - You lie. - I don't believe you, Danglars. Danglars, do you know what you have cost me? You've read the paper, haven't you? But, gentlemen, you've lost nothing... I lose when I do not make. I want to know what this is all about. I've made good every penny. I demand to know. - I will take the matter up with the chamber. - The bonds on governments. - Confess, Danglars, confess, you are a scoundrel. - Be advised, Danglars, - I am taking you to court. - After me, I am taking him to court, first. - No, after me. On charges of false representation. - Misusing of funds! Embezzlement. - I begin by withdrawing my account from this bank. - Yes, so will I, before the run begins. The run! - If you can't trust the biggest banker in Paris... I shall go now... Three. Albert. What a pleasant surprise, Albert. I'm not here to exchange hypocritical expressions of politeness, but to demand an explanation. For what, my dear boy. Oh, I spotted a story in the paper this morning. the one casting terrible aspersions on my father. On his integrity. On his military accomplishments. On his honor! Yes. And it's in the journal de globe. The newspaper you so recently purchased. You are in my home, Albert. I, alone, have the right to raise my voice here. You're responsible for that story. Do you deny it? No. I consider the glove thrown, Albert. Tomorrow morning, sir. Field of Mars at dawn. The Field of Mars. Why? - You would not kill my son. He challenged me, madame. And what would you expect from a proud son? The general is his father. I had a father, once. Then you know how the boy feels. You can understand how zealous he is after the general's good name. What general? My business is with a lieutenant I used to know. What business? Revenge, madame. For what? A man even going in love. He does not deserve your vengeance. It was I. I was weak. I could bear my loneliness no longer. I married him because they told me you died in the Chateau D'if shortly after your arrest. But why was I in the Chateau D'if? Why was I arrested? I do not know. I presume you recognize the hand? How did you come by this? With bribery, madame. I cannot believe... For 14 years, because of that letter, I lived in the dungeon of the Chateau D'if, So near to you, and I never knew that you’d married, or that my father had died, Of hunger. Hunger! Oh, I did not know. We had moved away. Ask me to forgive a man for stealing my love with a lover's deception, very well, since you ask it, I forgive him that. Ask me to forgive him for stealing 14 years of my life. Very well, forgiven. But forgive him for destroying my father. Never, madame. Never! In my dreams I have seen you dead. Thrown to the bottom of one of those pits where jailers throw their dead prisoners. And I awake from this incessant dream with a cry, shuddering cold. Have you ever dreamed your father dead of hunger? Have you ever dreamed of the one you loved giving her hand to a rival, While you perish at the bottom of a pit. What! I have seen him I loved on the point of murdering my son. Oh, Edmond, please. What good has it done for me to mourn for you eternally in the secret recesses of my heart? When I thought you dead, i should have died, too. But foolishly I went on living, and for nearly 20 years compared all men to you and found them wanting. Missing you has been a day after day, year after year torment to me. And in all this time my one consolation has been my son. My innocent son who should have been ours. Our son, Edmond. Ready. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 She told you. Everything. I offer you my apologies, sir. You have every right to expose my father. Providence, again. I am the emissary of God. I've been spared to carry out his will. General Mondego, This special committee of the house of deputies Is well aware of your illustrious past. - We salute, with profound respect, the decorations - you bear as testament to your extraordinary military career. - It is then a great disturbance to this committee to read the - revelations in the news paper, Le Journal de Globe. - Starting yesterday with a threat of disclosures, Le Journal de Globe - continues today with a long list of definite accusations. It is written here, in the Greek War when you were French emissary to Court of Ali Pasha, that you betrayed him to the Turks. - It is written here... - M. le President, May I proceed immediately to my own defense? Proceed, monsieur. Document. A signed letter from the Ali Pasha, himself, proposing the expressions of the utmost confidence. So complete was his faith in me, that on his deathbed he resigned his wife and daughter to my care. His wife and daughter. What happened to that wife and daughter? I searched for them, M. le President, in the midst of the battle. My life was in constant danger, but I searched for them until I found them. They had been slaughtered by the enemy. Can you produce testaments to the truth of what you have asserted? Monsieur le President, if the signed proof of Ali Pasha is not enough, I offer my word of honor as a french officer. Last, but not least, this. You ask for witnesses of proof, I ask for a show of witnesses against me. What is the evidence? Some article in a scurrilous journal. Who gave these lies to this newspaper? Where is he? Let him come forward, And throw a glove in my face! Monsieur le Compte, your defense has the ring of validity, Your points well taken. You will therefore be gratified to learn The contents of this note i have just received. As follows: I was present at the death of Ali Pasha. I know what has become of the wife and the daughter. I claim the honor of being heard. Who wrote those words? The note is unsigned, sir, but the witness can be summoned on your approval. Only on your approval. Let him appear. Let him appear. Will you identify yourself, please? I am the daughter of Ali Pasha. In front of you, sir, is a register of my birth and my baptism. There is also in that packet a record of the sale of my person and that of my mother. A sale, you say? A French officer sold us into slavery for the sum of 40,000 francs. The name of that officer. Fernand Mondego. You were trusted by my noble father. You were loved by him as a son. He had trusted you with the safe conduct of his wife and daughter. But you're a liar. A traitor. An assassin. Assassin! It was your sword that killed my father. Monsieur le General, will you reply? Lies. Lies. They're lies. You take the word of an infidel foreigner against the word of a general Of the army of the king? The woman is an imposter! Who is an imposter? She is truly the daughter of ali pasha. Those documents will prove it. They'll verify themselves soon enough. And when they are verified, General Mondego, Count of Mondego, hero of Yannina, What, what is your connection with this woman? Ask first, what is my connection with one named Edmond Dantes. Edmond. So, the light begins to break. Old sailor boy. Back from the isle of the dead, huh? Heh. Insisting on his revenge and getting it. I begin to see, yes. Caderousse dead, Danglars dead, Villefort confined to an asylum. Is it my turn, Edmond? It is. You've done exceedingly well. They way you expose us one by one. And then you'll strike. You ruin a man with exquisite finesse. But, before you kick this dog to death, beware. He barks. Barks! By having ruined me you now give me cause for revenge. I now claim the right to send the dead back to the dead. Can you defend yourself, Edmond? Or do you stab only in the dark? Gentlemen, gentlemen, please! I beg you, please listen! Don't say your prayers. You won't escape prison by the simple trick of dying. You'll serve you sentence in this world, before you go to hell. General Mondago, you are under arrest. Four Mercedes. Mercedes! Mercedes! Why is the house empty? Where is the Countess Mondego? She has gone to Marseille. When? Yesterday. Mercedes. Where are you traveling? To Africa, to find my son and be near him. He's joined the army. Albert, a soldier? He wants to expiate his father's sins. Let me join you on your voyage. I can be of help to you both. My son would never permit that. What you said, he should have been our son. Should have been, yes. But he has a father, and he has his father's name. A name you so thoroughly destroyed. That was simple justice, madame. And believe me, it brought me no joy. And now my task's accomplished. I've no particular place in the world, No strong desire in life, but to make amends where I've hurt the innocent. Avenging angels may not ask forgiveness of their victims. I am no longer the instrument of God. I've been plunged back into nothingness. I'm searching for... I'm lost. My soul, my self. For Edmond Dantes. You will never find him. He died a long time ago in the Chateau D'if. And much of me is buried with him. But I celebrate the Count of Monte Cristo’s return to the world of men, and I wish for him, from the depths of my heart, that he will find the peace for which he earned. But, no, Never will he find that perfect love, Which two young people lost, irretrievably lost so many, many years ago. Bon voyage. Countess Mondego. Goodbye, Count.
