Original Subtitle: Manvagtoo Retimed by Nicksden Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES LATE WINTER Mr. Yanagida... Let me move you. It's 110. Hello. May I speak to you for a minute? Michio... Here is your lunch. Will he pull through? It's a miracle that he is still alive. Down to 97. Over 80. I'll get the doctor. What was that? I can't remember. What...? 'What was it?' Tomiko! Call the doctor! The time of death was 03.47 a.m. May he rest in peace. He woke up and spoke, just before he died. Didn't he, Michio? Yanagida Photo Studio. See you again someday. Your dad held it out for a while. Take a deep breath. Do... do....p.....people see flashbacks when they die? That's what is said. S....so....p... people see their life p... pass before them. Not again. The bus drivers are on strike. Shall we walk? What did.... What did your father mean when he said: 'What was it?' DOKURITSU SHONENGASSO DAN (BOY'S CHOIR) Dokuritsu Orphanage Junior High School This is the Holy Bible. Have you ever read it? It contains the Word of God. Please, treasure it. Michio. Please think of this school as your home. Let us say a prayer. Oh Lord God. We thank You for Your many blessings. Today you have brought a new member to our community. May his stay here be blessed with Your Love Is that warm? Sorry. Yasuo... what are you doing? Go to the clinic....now. Yes sir. I'll go later. You'll go now! The flu is going around. Get into line. Straighten the line. Next. Open your mouth. Today we have a new classmate. His father died recently, so he is an orphan. It takes time to adjust to life here, so be nice to him. Go ahead. Introduce yourself. H....how do you do? He got a stutter! What is your problem? Both of you! Stop it now! What's going on here? Neither of you knows a single thing about the other. How can you hate each other, when you have never met before? He gets on my nerves. Go on. Sit down. Why can't you all get along? Where have you been? Did it hurt? Pastor Seino. When will it be finished? Sometimes I think I'll be better off teaching in the city. I thought I could get closer to the kids here. I have no idea what's going thru their heads. I'm losing my confidence. You are probably just homesick. No... It's not that. How long have you been here? This is my third year. Is it not lonely here? I like being here. They are much better to handle than the city kids. You really think so? Looks like they are going crazy. Radicals bomb four police stations. I hear that you were a radical during the student riots. That was a long time ago. Now I am a carpenter. You can't be both a christian and a revolutionary. Wait here. This shows that you are present. This way. Hello. Your dormitory. No. 7. Yoshinori Abe. Present. No. 11. Katsutoshi Sakata. Present. No. 23. Hajime Miyata. Present No. 32. Michio Yanagida. 'When a new doctrine is espoused from a fresh new idea, ' 'we are bidden to appraise such doctrine highly.' Who will I select to read from here? So... How about Yanagida? Yanagida? Oh... the newcomer. Good. Would you like to? What's wrong? Sir. I will read it. Okay. Go ahead. Aren't they so sweet? Yasuo's got a little sister! Alright Sakata. Shut up. I'll wash you, Yasuo. No pubes yet? You'll never get them. The succession of Japanese emperors... Emperor Kousho, Koan... S... Stut... S..s... stutterer... Stutterer. Stutterer... Stutterer... Hey... Running away? They'll see you. Go out by the back. The station is that way. The first train is at 05.47. Don't do it. You will only get caught. The stationmaster will call the school. Where will you go? I have a house. My name is Yasuo Ito. I was born on March 30th, My address is 208, No. 5. Steel Housing, Sakamachine 306, Inamura City. Blood type is AB, which is rare for Japanese. My dream is to join the Vienna Boys' Choir. Don't forget about me! Don't go. It is not so bad here. I promise you. This way. Hurry! Sir! Here he is. Hello son. What is your name? Mi....mi ....chio Yanagida. Try exhaling first. Michio Yanagida. Sorry. Let me try something. Sing me a song. Huh? Anything. Just song me a song. The ties of our friendship are stronger than blood. So very, very strong. Okay. That's enough. Did you notice anything? You don't stutter when you are singing. Do you know why? One, two... Open your mouths wide. Nice and wide. Make it come from the top of your head. More, more. Now louder. Louder. Make your mouth into an 'O'-shape. Hold the note! Your voice is something that has to come out. It is only your mind that stops it. The human body is like a musical instrument for the voice. Your head, throat, belly.... Everything resonates. It is called 'singing'. - Yasuo! - Hai! Take the kinks out. Okay. You are so stiff. Someday you will end up as a rock. A song is born out of silence. Let us close our eyes. Beyond the darkness of the night fog, The brave lad has to leave home, fighting for his country. The lights flood from the window of the house. A maiden is at the windows, bidding him farewell Stop! To reach that note, you must open your mouths wide. As the note extends, you must open your throat. Especially bass and tenors. Remember... It is a song about war. Hai. The brave lad, leaving for war, parting from the maiden. So don't emphasize just 'then night fog'. That has to be sung softly. The tone rises, but you maintain the softness. The night fog, nice and smooth. Picture him walking in the fog. The brave lad. The brave lad. The brave lad. The brave lad. The brave lad. The brave lad. The brave lad. The brave lad. They say that man began to sing before he could speak. To live means to breathe. To sing, you must breathe deeply. So for real living, just sing. MID SPRING GOOD CONDUCT WEEK Hey! Stop there. It is all crooked. Look at the curve. I'll carry that, ma'am. No, I'm alright. I insist. Thank you so much. TUBERCULOSIS SANITORIUM We can't go in. We might be infected. But we can sing in the courtyard. We are the Dokuritsu School Glee Club. We are here to sing our humble songs for you. Thank you for your attention. The stream of the river Volga stretches far away. The worthy vessel, Stienka Razin, glides through the river. Harken the sweet lips of the princess of Persia. The sumptuous gathering is so filled with cheer. Aboard the good ship Don Cossack. They asked for something more cheerful. What's that? A request. Do you know it? As long as I live, I will be searching for my love. Even when in pain and sorely tired, I want you to love me, right to my bones. That's what I want from you. Maybe they don't like choirs. We need more good singers. Only Yasuo is good enough. We need more than one. We need to practice harder. Why did you sing such a stupid song? Good evening. Hello there. Hello there. Good Evening. Do you mind of we get some of your scrap wood? Dear Lord. After completing a day of honest toil, we turn to You again. All comes from You, ends in You, and lives within You. Be quiet. Let him begin. Tonight, I would like to read something from Matthew 5. And seeing the multitues, He went up the mountain. And he opened His mouth, and taught them, saying, blessed are the poor in spirit: Pastor.... You can't paraphrase the Bible. For theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn: American soldiers pray as they drop their bombs. Enough! Everyone is with sin. Yeah, right. 'Blessed are the poor...' 'while the rich are in heaven.' What else have you got, besides poverty? That's enough. Blessed are the peacemakers: For they shall be called the children of God. Senpai. Not seen you for a long time. You have a tough life. They are here to mix and having some fun. There is more than just the Bible. What? I need your help. Satomi. I heard about the bombings. We get newspapers here. Manual of Hiking. Very careless, Satomi. What if I called the police? Yara got arrested, comrade. He said you would help me. Don't call me 'comrade'. That's all over for me. It will be soon dinner time. Go on ahead of me. Are you Yasuo? This is for you. I heard you wanted it. Give it back. Stay away from my students. Won't you help me? You can't make a revolution by bombing. Yara would hate to hear saying you this. No commitment, no change. It will never happen. Japan has not come to terms with the last war. Yet you expect a revolution? Nothing will happen, except that we will slowly go crazy. You are hiding behind a religion! You certainly don't believe in God. What are you doing? You are pretending that you're dead. You're a coward. And a hypocrite. I am at loss what to do. My mother took me to see the Vienna Boys' Choir once. 'They begin training from the age of seven.' 'At ten, they try out for the choir.' 'Only one of thirty is selected.' 'When their voices change, they must retire.' When I went to the concert.... I met one of them. This boy here... His name is Andrei. I asked him of I could join. He said that my voice was good enough to get in. They tour all around the world. Did you speak Japanese to him? -Good Conduct Week Results- You saved Isobe's life? Indeed. He had no heartbeat. You saved his life? Yes. I gave him artificial respiration. I saved him. Is what he says true, Isobe? Yeah. You fell into the pond? Yeah. What were you doing there? We were collecting angel weed. What? Angel weed? That particular variety only lives in clear water. Its white flower bloom only three days a year. Its stem grows from one to two meters. This is Mt. Daicho, and here is the pond. The pond fills with snow-melt from the mountain. It goes underground and comes out at the pond. It never hits the air, so it's icy cold. Never swim there, not even in summer. Understood? Answer me! Hai What did you see? Tell us. It was like a border between this world and the.... It is very hard to actually putting it into words..... Come on. Tell us! My late mother was waving at me from the far side of a garden. On the other side, I could see my father waving too. I was so happy, but I could not move at all. There was a gentle breeze and the sweet smell of flowers. It's freezing! It is really cold. If my heart stops, you better resucitate me. I mean it. I can't. It is too cold. No... Don't go in. You'll die. I'll be okay. I'll come back. No. You must not do it! This is bad. It's really bad. I'm scared. He lied. What in hell!!! I thought I had get some kind of flashbacks. They say that your entire life is passing by before your very eyes. Still it was silly. You could have died. Did you get a flashback? We are only fifteen. Not much to flash back on. Right. Of the things you forgot and those you remembered, which is the most important one? My father... as he was dying, he said something very strange. He asked: 'What was it?' A flashback? He ended his life with a question. Put your caps on. The Soviets have been testing their H-bombs again. You don't want getting bald! Sir... My hoe is broken Hey Yasuo! (Hai) Go to my toolbox and bring me a hammer and a wedge. (Hai, Hai) Who's there? Yasuo? Sorry. I probably shocked you. I have to get some tools. Sure. I am just an intruder. I have nowhere to go. Do I smell bad? Did you find them? You are from the orphanage, isn'it it? Give this poster to your administrator. Post it somewhere prominent. 'Wanted for bombing policie stations' Thank you. Once you're finished... leave. Please. Sir... Let's enter the competition this year. The eighth note, 're'. Eight note, 'ti'. (Hai) Go on to the next measure. (Hai) A full note 'do'. (Hai) Include the previous measure with slur. (Hai) Follow that up with a full decrescendo. (Hai) And a bar. (Hai) Piano. (Hai) Dolce. Pay attention to the meter. 'The thunder of hooves on the never-ending plain' 'Warriors all, of a manly men' It celebrates the Red Army during the Russian Revolution. It's a wordplay. 'Steppes' and 'manly men'. The Red Army is advancing across the great steppes. He was a famous Russian composer. He served in the Red Army for five years. 'History of the Russian Revolution' You are breathing wrong. Don't stop here. Continue to here, then breath. Shape your mouth to an 'AH'. Start on my count. (Hai) One, two.... Close your eyes. Okay. Polyushaka Polie, the horses hoove as they race across the steppes Ridden by men, sitting high at the saddle Oh fair maidens, you who succor them, don't cry. We see, in the far beyond, a shining path open to us. And in the heaven's dark clouds do sit in majesty. In the shadows of the forest All can sense the impending doom We shall fight on, fair maidens, our men will go forth in battle We menfolk of yours will pit ourselves against the enemy Blood Pressure Temperature Pulse For a moment you were dead. Your soul at one with all. Pure harmony. Are you alright? Y... yes Ready to practice? Yes. Pastor.... The railway guys are on strike. They won't turn up. Shall we start? Go on. What a drag. Is that the Bible? Yes. We are a Bible-reading class. Who are you? Let us join you. Bible-class, eh? Sure. Your first time? (Hai) Start reading the first page. Me? Read? Yes. Go on. Read. In the beginning God created heaven and earth And the earth was without form and void. And darkness was upon the face of the deep.... She is here. You are under arrest! Get back! Don't move! Satomi!!!! No.....! Sorry for all the trouble. Looks like you got the third degree. I guess, I'm not clergy material. MID SUMMER -School is out until August 28- The Johoku Girls' Choir is honored to join you. Into formation. Looking winning again this year? We expect to win. Then it is on the finals in Tokyo. No... I meant winning in Tokyo. Girls.... Practice on the boy's bellies. Begin! Too hard. What a weakling. By the way.... Your voice really has improved. Maybe better than Andrei's. - Are you a fan? - Yes! Me too! But your voice will soon change. Boy's voices are best just before they change. I am looking forward hearing how you will sound. In the bosom of mother earth Our joy in being human does live on Love the earth, live with the earth Children of the earth Children of the earth Give thanks to our mother earth Will you go home to see your family? Let's go see Adamo. You are from Kubokawa, right? He is giving a concert. Who is Adamo? What's the matter? A Belgian miner's son! I hate him! -Adamo Recital- It is too hot to work. Thank you. Come on son. -THE SECOND TERM- It is spooky. I went to his mother's bar, but he had not been there. Did he tell you anything? His father works at a foundry in Kawasaki. Maybe he is there. I thought he worked at some autofactory in Aichi. Yasuo does not have a father. Michio... Do you know anything? No sir. What's that for? He is back. Where have you been? We became sick of worrying. School started last week. Where have you been? Hi there. Where were you? I'll see you in office after class. What happened? I've... 'I have lost my voice.' 'Be my voice.' Yashuo. Have you really lost your voice? - It's true. - You will never sing again? Let me have a look. Why now? - 'Let me be the...' - What? 'Let me conduct the choir.' He did some study over the holidays. Starting today, we will wear these bandannas at all times, for keeping us focused on our goal. Your throats belong no longer to you alone. These will not come off... until we win! What? Around the neck? 'I was in Tokyo.' I went to Satomi's university. I met her comrades who had worked alongside her in the revolution. I told them how Satomi died. They wept. 'There is a war going on in Tokyo.' 'The revolution is coming.' 'Young people are pitting themselves against the might of the state.' 'People are waiting for worldwide revolution.' 'In China, children calling themselves The Red Guard, have completely overturned the system.' 'A new world is within our grasp.' 'Even students must join the revolution.' 'They have asked us to join them.' 'Let's win this round of the choral heats and go to Tokyo in full voice.' One, two, three! We chose our songs carefully. A song to spur the masses to rise up in revolt. Work hard! On to Tokyo! We'll go by train. Kamikatacho station. This is a technique from the Viena Boys' Choir. If your vocalization is correct, you won't blow it out. If it is wrong, you'll blow the candle out. Let's not blow out our candles! You kids are hard at it. Has Yasuo really lost his voice? It is true, Sir. I see. Michio. You are no longer stuttering. Yes. That's right. You have changed. Yes. The sound of horses hooves as they race across the steppes Ridden by men sitting high at the saddle Oh fair maidens, you who succor them, don't cry. His thoat was raw, his voice a hoarse mockery. Not one among the crowd noticed, he had arrived. I'm sure one of you would like to finish the story. How about Yashuo? Do you, Yashuo? I will read it, Sir. If you don't stutter! Shut up. Go ahead Michio. The gallows were in place, the noose being hoisted ever higher It was then that he realized. He summoned his last ounce of strength to fight thru the crowd. It is me! I am the one who should die! I have allowed him to suffer in my place! His voice hoarse, he fell at the feet of his good friend. That was very good. What? That's no fun. Asaka station. Tsukasa station.... Kagami station... The soldiers are marching courageously into the town. That is pathetic... No, I can't. I quit. Wait! Come back. Don't walk out. What are you doing? Stop it! I said: 'Stop it'. Take those scarves off. Take them off now. Michio. Yashuo. Are you so eager to win? Then sing with your own voice. I can't. I have lost my voice. I don't believe that. Your voice is only changing. You are just growing up. If you can't sing, then you can't go. With this voice, I will never sing. It does not matter if it is falsetto, or if it's hoarse. You will sing! If you don't, we won't go. Sir... we want to sing for the revolution. We must go to Tokyo. There will be no revolution! It is just a dream. Then for what Satomi died? Because we hit the wall! Much to my despair. That's why I am here. Yasuo... Can't you understand? No, I can't. We don't sing for a cause. That's why just singing in itself is important. It has no special significance. That's exactly why it is so good. There will be no revolution. There will be no overthrow. I never should have started singing! I have a bad voice. That is okay. I can be you, you can be me. It does not matter. If you can't sing, I will be your voice. I wanted to sing. And to talk too. Let's go to Tokyo. Bang and beat until it breaks! 23rd NATIONALE CHORUS COMPETITION PRELIMINARY HEATS Okay... Gather around. Hello! I waited for you at Adamo's concert. We are going to win. We are going to Tokyo. That's enough. They are really strange. Take it off. Don't think of anything else. Just sing. You are ready to go on stage. Okay. Everyone... Give your best. Yes. Close your eyes. Good. In the preliminary heats, of the 23rd National Choir Competition, we won the third prize. BEGINNING OF WINTER What do we now call the terms which cemented the rule of the Emperor Meiji in March 1868? - You answer it. - Yes The Five-Point Imperial Convenant. Yes, that is correct. In the same year, the name of the erea was changed to Meiji... Pass me that clamp, Yasuo. Sir. When will you finish? Next winter I guess. It is hard to say. She had a baby. Last month? It's a girl. The spitting image of her father! Is she really? What's that? Who would be her father then? A good question! Could be anyone! Good day. Can we get some scraps? There is plenty at the back. Yasuo!!!! Yasuo!!!! Yasuo? You are alive! Sorry I crashed the truck. I am sorry. Forget it. Are you alright? I must go. I am sorry. Forgive me. Forgive me. That's enough. 'What was it?' It is dark. No. It is light. I'm under the sea. I have drowned. Can you see the ocean? I went to the beach when I was nine. To the sea. I was a bad boy. Yasuo. Am I within you? Are you...? My name is Yashuo Ito, born on March 30th, 1957. My address is.... Stop. That's enough. Don't go. Michio... Sing with me. Let's sing together. Yes. Let's sing. The End Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
