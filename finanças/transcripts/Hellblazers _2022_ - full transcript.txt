Time has come, my friends For a long time we have struggled, haven't we? Starving for what is to come. For tonight we quench our thirst for the manifestation of our beliefs. A perfect subject approaches. A perfect subject approaches. A perfect vessel. Throw him in. Steve didn't dig a hole to hell for nothing, put him in there. Lorna. I really miss you. I'll try and get ya a fresh one every day. Who the hell is on my property? Hello!? We have brought you forth in good faith and great effort. You must feed and transform further and become stronger. My loyal subjects are but your servants and are here to help you with that task. Be free, but not just yet. Be free and let chaos reign. All right, cool. Now, see that the beast is fed. No. Now, now, now, now. Holy shit. Lorna, we got a big problem. Morning, Timmy. Damn it, Timmy, what? Damn kid. Poncho! Hey, Poncho! Come here, boy. Where the hell did you run off to? Poncho, come here, boy. Hey! Hey, Sheriff! Rick. Getting all settled in, are ya? As much as one can, I guess. Not much to get settled into now, is there? Yeah, I know. She ain't much to look at, but we have a close knit community here, it's been that way for 50 years. That's what they told me. I get it. You big town folk aren't too keen on small town living. We don't got your supermarkets or your Radioshacks. I like the quiet, actually, Rick. Oh, well that's good 'cause we got plenty of that. Chiggers and snakes, too. Rick. I'll leave ya to it. See ya. Ooh, that's nice. - Look good? - Yeah. - Come on, coffee. - Where? - Right here. - All right, get ready. Yeah. All right. - See if it works? - Mm hmm. - Oh! - That's a real good one, - that was real close. - I know, pretty close. Morning, everyone. - Morning. - Morning, Sheriff. Anything new to report? Yeah, um. Oh, somebody stole Frosty from the Teegan's front yard yesterday. Really? I swear, who steals a plastic snowman? That's it? Uh, there might be a rabid coon up in Fox Tail Canyon. Again? Yeah. Raccoons, what do you... I don't know how to deal with raccoons. How do you guys normally deal with raccoons? We have to shoot 'em. Especially if it's rabid, yeah. I guess that makes sense. Not many raccoons in New York, boss? Lots, just never had to deal with any rabid ones. Is that a normal thing around here? What? Rabid animals. Sometimes. Yeah, especially the cows. Ooh. Cows. Oh yeah, a lot of vampires swooping around. Vampires. What the hell are we talking about here? Bats. Bats? Yeah, rodents who fly. Yeah, they carry rabies, boss. Bite the cow's legs and transfer it over to the damn things. - It gets real bad. - It gets weird. Like that movie. What movie? The movie. The one with the mother and the son, they're in the car, the rabid dog just... The mother, the son, they're in the car with the dog with rabies and trapped. Really? No one here? No, I can't say I've ever seen a movie like that, Sheriff. Yeah. Have you? - Uh, no. - No. Are you a big fan of movies, boss? Yeah, I guess you could say that. All right, well, I'm gonna go make the rounds, so... You hold down the fort? See you later. He's got a crush. Oh. Hi, Teddy. Morning. Um, can I get you a cup of coffee? That'd be wonderful. So, how's the new sheriff? Oh, he's quiet. That makes sense. Does it? Sure. He doesn't really know any of us here. Yeah, I suppose that's true. Sure is. He moved all the way out here from a place half a world away. Big city, all the lights, all the people. I wonder what that must be like. What's that? That I wonder how that must feel. Probably pretty lonely. Oh. I guess I hadn't thought about it. Don't give him too much grief. Who, me? I wouldn't dream of it. Hey, Deanna. Mornin', Harry. Ah, Teddy. How you doing? How's our little fledgling town doing this morning? Oh, well, the day's just started, sir, so... Yeah, I suppose it is, I suppose that is true, I suppose so. Uh, Teddy. Let me ask you something. He's a nice fella, Harry. He hasn't really begun making his rounds around here yet, so a whole lotta people think that he's a bit cold. Lonely maybe. Yeah, I guess it takes time adjusting to a quiet place. Uh, Teddy, um... How's your mama doing? Is she liking it down in Dallas? She is. She does, likes it just fine. It's a change of scenery for her, so it oughta do her some good. There are some things about home she misses, though. Yeah, make sure to give her my best. All right, well, I better be off. Thank you for the coffee, Deanna. Harry. Teddy. What you waiting for, huh? That's a good kid. What's wrong with you? Let me have a glass of eggnog. Fine. This kid doesn't know what he started. Only one, though. Only one. There's nothing in it, right? Ooh, look at you lookin' busy. You doing all right? Yeah, I'll live. Streets are clean. All right. Mornin', Bill. Anything I can do for you and the 12 gauge you just slammed on my desk? I wanna make a complaint. Okay, about what exactly? On my property last night something happened. I had a group of visitors. Trespassers? Visitors. What... I don't understand. Visitors, what do you call 'em? Trespassers. Oh, okay, well that must be a big city word. I don't get it. Actually, it's just English, Bill. Do you know who these individuals are? No, sir. Did they take anything? Did they destroy anything? Well, they were dressed in sheets. All kind of like, I don't know, Purdue University sheet-looking things, you know, with that color. They had that horrible Purdue color, you know? The team never makes the final four, but when they do, they wear that awful, I don't know, yellowish kinda thing that they have. Sheets that color. Faces covered, scarves over their nose, and act like like they were in Afghanistan or some fucking place. They started dancing around. Moving, swaying, doing all that stuff, and started with all that hippie stuff only it wasn't Na Merengue. You know, the bald guys, and with the orange on. And they all start holding hands and made a ring. There was about a dozen of 'em. They were dancing around, then they joined hands, then they danced around in a circle like old hippie girls or like, you know, the Hare Krishna people. And then they started chanting. It was in rhyme and they were altogether on it. And then they started chanting words in a gibberish kind of a language. And then, all of a sudden, they drag a guy out of the bushes over there and he's laying down right here and next to him the earth started to open up. The earth started to open up. And I'm way over there watching and I look down and I can't see down in the hole but it goes way down. And it's a door to hell. And out of that hole. Hey, bud, look at me. Out of that hole comes a thing. And as it gets higher and higher out of the ground and I see the whole thing it's the most terrifying horrible looking beast you've ever seen in your life. A being. Some kind of, you know, thing you couldn't imagine could ever be put together. Frightening, terrifying! And then you know what the beast says? He goes into the body of the guy on the ground. And he's gone, but the body is there. And he's in the body, so he now is in this body. This horrifying thing. Who is capable, I'm sure, of anything. Anything else? I'm sorry? Is there anything else? Uh, yeah. I was in 'Nam and I saw a lotta shit. You're from the big city. Mmhmm. You've seen a lotta shit. But neither one of us ever saw shit as scary or frightening as this and you gotta do something about it. All right, let me get this straight. You got a whole buncha people on your property- Yeah. They're wearing Purdue uniforms? Yeah. They're dancing around and singing. - Right. - And wearing - funky pants. - Chanting, chanting. Chanting. A hole opens in the ground. - Yeah. - Okay, so something- And the hole was deep. - Okay, so deep hole. - Yeah. Something comes out of the hole... - Yeah. - Goes into the body. - Yeah. - Where does the body go? Got up and ran off that way into the woods. - Of course it did. - The other folks all just took off. Let me ask you a question. You know if kids like to come on your property and they like to party, - any of that stuff? - Speak up, asshole. What? I'm trying to help you - and you call me an asshole? - Yeah, but I can't hear you. Okay, am I allowed to be deaf? Yeah, you're allowed to do whatever you want. Okay. What's the question? You got a lotta kids that come on your property - and they like to party? - Never, never. You've only been here a couple weeks, you don't know me. They know who I am and they don't come on my property. And after three minutes with me now you also know who I am. I'm a raging asshole, but I got game. - You got game? - And I saw something - bigger than game last night. - Okay. Are you a drinker? Does Pinocchio have a wooden dick? Hey. Y'all seen Poncho? I can't find him anywhere. - Again, Bernard? - Jesus Christ. Can't you put a leash on your fucking dog one time? He doesn't need a leash in this town, Bill. Of course he needs a leash, he's a dog! He's got a dog named Poncho. The dog is never on a leash! You know, there are signs out there that say every dog should be on a leash. He's a dog, he's mangy, he's a critter, he bites people, and the dog is a bit of an asshole. - Plus he's a Mexican dog. - What! - Okay- - Never call my dog an asshole, old man. - If you ever call my dog- - I said he was a Mexican dog. All right, come on, come on, let's go. - Let's go. - Are you saying Mexicans are assholes? Okay, all right, Bill. - Let's go. - Thank you, Teddy. I just told you you were worried about some fucking guy who can't keep his dog on a leash? I'm listening to you. - I'll go check your property- - Please. Don't call me an asshole anymore. Uh, did I call you an asshole? You did. But I also tell you before that I'm an asshole? - Okay. - In 'Nam communication was the whole thing. So look for the phone lines to go down at some point and then be talking on short wave radios and you'll hear the chatter back and forth and that's the first warning. That's when you know. Hello. Yeah? Um, Bill, give me a few minutes. I'll go take a look at your property, okay? You don't need to worry about it, I already prepared for it. What's that supposed to mean? You'll see. I get shit done. This is bad shit, get it taken care of. Because if you don't take care of it, all hell's about to break loose. I'll take care of it. First thing on my list, Bill. Thanks for coming in. Bill, your gun. He's very creepy. Is that normal? Um, he's been a little off lately. I mean, he's been seeing weird things, he once claimed to see like an alien landing, but that was just a couple kids screwing around, so... - Charlie. - Good morning, Sheriff. Morning, Sheriff. Where are you two headed off to? Uh, we're just gonna go look at some eagles. Oh, be careful. Yes, sir. Oh, Timmy. Timmy, do me a favor. Stop delivering papers on your bicycle. They're blowing all over town, okay? - Okay, Sheriff. - All right. Are you counting the days? 'Cause I am. It's less than a week until jolly old Saint Nick comes to visit Hope Valley for the 22nd annual Christmas Giving Celebration and photos with Santa. So, bundle up the kids, bring 'em on down, and have a good one. Thanks, sweetie. And now here's the latest hit from The Midnight. Uh, morning, Sheriff. Bobby. Um, I'm gonna go open up the store, Mom. Okay. Did you get anything new down there? "Elvira" and "Killer Clowns from Outer Space". I was hoping for "All the President's Men". Yeah, next time. - I'll see you later, sweetie. - All right. Sheriff. What can I do for you, Joe? You have time for some questions? Yep, I got about three minutes. Do you get many listeners out here? Lots of farm folk from miles around. They gotta have something to listen to while they fix their trailers and milk their damn cows. You get any chatter on the other channels with this thing? Uh, I don't switch channels too often. Too much religion and not enough rock n' roll. But on occasion I do, especially if there's a disaster in the area. You might could say I use it for news purposes. Why do ya ask? You listen to anything last night? Yeah. Anything sound a bit unusual? Not that I can think of. Okay. There was a wreck up by the junction and a man was reported missing near Abel Station. Missing persons? Yeah. That's not unusual. A lotta guys up and leave their wives for younger legs. The way of the world, Sheriff. The way of the world. Okay, thanks, Georgia. Hey, do me a favor. Let me know if anything strange comes across these channels, okay? Anything I should know about? No, just wanna keep my ear close to the ground, that's all. I hate to tell ya, Joe, but nothing too exciting happens around here. Yeah, that's what they keep telling me. Can I give you some advice? Sure. Not all places are bad. Some places attract bad folks, but don't go looking for trouble if there's none to find. Thanks for the advice. Have a good day. Teddy, you copy? Go for Teddy. Where the hell did you disappear off to? I'm looking for Bernard's dog. He said he might be out here on MacDaniels Road chasing jackrabbits. So, then where are you? MacDaniels Road, Liz. Copy that, see you when you get back. Y'all ever get rid of Bill? Yeah, he finally left, but not before having some Vietnam flashbacks. Any more prophecies from the end times we should be worried about? He did say something about them cutting the phone lines. I don't know, his usual crazy stuff. Does Bill even have a phone? That road is bumpy as hell, Teddy. Don't go breaking another car. Good lord, I won't, Liz. All right, well don't stay out too long. Teddy out. Come on! So much for spotting eagles. There's a ton of 'em out here, I promise. What was that? I don't know. Probably one of those eagles. Come on. It's nothing. Okay, no, someone's out here with us, come on. Like... - All right, I'll take a look. - Go check. Go see what it is. You mean who it is! It's probably a hitchhiker trying to mess with us. Relax. Please, open the door! Open the door, unlock the door, unlock the door! Please, please, please, - hurry up the door! - Charlie, I can't! Charlie! Lorna! Take a look at this. Here they come. Here's the first asshole dressed like he went to fucking Purdue. Oh, look, he brought a little partner with him and he's got some kind of peculiar shit in his hand. This guy's got a knife, that guy's got, I don't know what he's got. Oh, and there's a third guy. Figures. Three assholes. You know, three amigos. Well, I'll tell ya what, boys. Or girls, whatever you might be. Did you ever play Teacher, May I? in school? Well, it goes like this. You can advance toward me only if I give you permission, so why don't you take five giant steps toward me. Come on down, son. Surprise for you. I did three tours in 'Nam. You think you're gonna sneak up on a crippled old man in a fucking wheelchair? Let's go, boys. Come on down. Let's get on with it, don't waste the whole fucking day. Now, why don't you come on down unless you're a chicken shit. Oh, what a fucking shame. Right in the grizzly bear trap. Does that hurt? Oh, yeah, that's a bear trap, son. You're not getting out of it. Are you trying to cut me? What are you slashing at me for? You're never gonna touch me. Look here, bud. Happy Hanukkah! How was the lunch, Joe, hm? Still got the best burger in town, Mary. It ain't saying much now, is it? - Mary! - Oh. I am so sorry I'm late. Honey, does it look like we're overflowing here? No, it does not. Cindy, have you met the new sheriff here? - Afraid I've not. - Delightful. Well, this here is Joe Anderson. Pleasure to meet you, Sheriff. Pleasure's all mine. Joe here's from New York. Oh, is that so? Afraid it is. And what brought you all the way down here? Change of scenery. Not a big fan of all that concrete, huh? Not a big fan of all those people, Mary. Thanks for the lunch. Don't mention it. Sheriff, just got a call into the office. What about? Loud noises coming from Bill's place. Loud noises? Yeah, neighbors said it sounded like explosions or something. Well, God knows what he has stashed out there at his place. Okay, where's Teddy? He's out looking for that missing dog. He's on his way back now. All right, we'll go take a look. Teddy can man the office till we get back. Cindy. Hope to see you around! Hope to see you around? What is wrong with me, Mary? Oh. It's called butterflies. I don't like butterflies. Yes, you do. - Sheriff, Sheriff, Sheriff. - Not now! He seems like an interesting fella. Hell, Bobby, all men are interesting if you look deep enough. What can I do for ya? About that timing belt. Let's do it up. Do it up? Does that mean you want me to order it for you? Yeah, how long do you think it'll take to get here? Well, I have to order it up from Ingram, so... But it usually only takes a couple of days. Come on. They usually have those in stock. Usually. Don't play with that. Hey, Terry. It's Rick here in Hope Valley. Yeah, yeah, me too. Uh, that's a very interesting story, Terry. Listen, Terry! How long will it take to get a timing belt delivered? A timing belt. Hello? Hello? Terry? What's the matter? That's odd. What? The phone went dead. That's strange. Are all the lines down? I'm not sure. Is your mom around? Should be. Mom, you here? Mom! Georgia? This one's dead, too. - Hey, boys. - Jesus, Joseph, and Mary. She got you, Bobby. I've been scaring the socks off that kid since he was two. Hey, well, it's not funny you gave me a heart attack. What's going on? The phones are dead. Yeah. All of 'em? Every single one of 'em. Georgia, what is it? The sheriff was in here this morning and he was concerned about something, but I couldn't put my finger on it. It could just be a technical thing. No need to work ourselves silly about it, right? Well, sure, Bobby, but we just saw the sheriff squeal outta here like a bat outta hell. Here off the 112 headed to Bill Unger's property. Copy that, Liz. Everything okay? Not sure. What'd you find out about the dog? You know, I'm not sure I wanna discuss that till we're back at the office. I'm pulling into town in a few seconds, so I'll see you both when you get back, okay? Copy that, Teddy. All right, Teddy out. Well, he's here right now. Hey, what are y'all doing here? You okay, Teddy? Yeah, tell us what's going on, Teddy. Uh, I'm not really sure I can explain it right now. Do the best you can, son. Okay, Rick. Well, I went out looking for Bernard's dog, I didn't find it, but I came across Timmy's bike and... And what? Yeah, I don't know, look, I need to make a phone call. I need to call Timmy's parents and make sure he got home safe. Rick says all the phone lines are down. All of 'em? All of 'em. I've seen that look before. Bill. Unger? Yeah. Yeah, he was in town this morning spouting his usual crazy nonsense. This time something about people on his property doing some weird stuff. Weird stuff? Yeah, he said to look out for the phone lines. What does that mean? Uh, the phone lines. He said... He was going on about communications. Teddy, where are the sheriff and Liz headed to now? Bill's place. That looks like blood. Yes, it does. What is that? He mine the place? It would appear that way now, wouldn't it? Where's Bill? I don't know. Sheriff? Sheriff? Give me a second. Joe! This is Teddy for Joe. Come in, Joe. Liz, do you read me? Liz, give me a read here. Anything. Maybe they're talking to Bill. Sure, maybe they aren't by their radio. No. No, a big city cop we're talking about here. He ain't dumb. He done do things the way we do here. What's that supposed to mean? He just means Joe's a skeptical guy, that's all. I can clarify that. Even with Bill's crazy ass stories he still wanted to investigate. I guess it takes somebody from out of town to think that guy's not totally off his nut. I wonder if Timmy's folks have a CB. All right, so what do we do? Why the hell you looking at me for? There's your new leader of the pack right there. No, no. Joe will be back. All right, he'll be back. We just stay put. And what do we do if he don't come back? All right. I'm gonna drive my rig over to Bill's, see what I can drum up. I'll stay on the short wave and listen for anything that comes in. All right, I guess I'll make the rounds and make sure that everybody's staying calm. And I guess I better go make sure Bernard's not out looking for his goddamn dog. Just stay calm, I'll go over and check on Harry and Deanna and I'll fill them in on the situation, Teddy. All right, Bobby. Hey, Rick. I thought you were leaving. Look, I got a problem. - Somebody ran off with my... - Somebody lifted my battery. How much you wanna bet every other vehicle on this block is inoperable? Bet you $5. Someone don't want us leavin'. Um, hello? Though I could pretty much guarantee that I got nothing in the shop that's gonna fit in that cruiser. But if the lines are back up I can give a call into Ingram tomorrow morning and that's the best I can do for you. I appreciate it, Rick. I've seen enough weird shit in the last 24 hours, I don't wanna wait till tomorrow morning. Okay. You have somewhere secure to hole up? I'm right here. All right. What do you want? Harry! Teddy! Someone! Help! Rick, you stay here. Harry! Teddy! Teddy! Somebody help! Where's the other one? What other one? Come on. Die! All right, you stay put, Bobby. Okay, you guys. I want you to get inside! All right, come on you sons of bitches. Close the door! Harry, no, come on. - No, no, no, no. - Come on. Shut the goddamn door! Harry! Show yourselves! Come on! I ain't in the mood for no hide and seek. What's with all the gunshots? I'm not so sure I know what's going on. It's better we stay here. Gunshots from Rick's place. Can you see him? No, but Rick's a smart fella. Yeah, well smarts don't matter if they get the jump on you like these fellas have. We've seen that. How the hell do they move so fast? Who are these people? I don't know. We have any guns in here? No. Harry's always hated the damned things. Yeah. All right. Wanna dance? Let's tango. Son of a bitch. How many of you fuckers are there? See ya, kitties. Shit. Holy shit. Oh, my God. All right, I gotta get back to the station. You can't go out there. Yeah, she's right, Teddy, you can't. No, there's no other option. Why? I got another revolver in the office, ammo, and I'm pretty sure I have a shotgun in the back of the cruiser. Shit, it might be in Joe's cruiser. Come on. Think, Teddy, think. Teddy. Here. Take that. My god, what is this thing doing in here? Harry always made us keep it in case anybody ever tried to rob the place. Yeah, right. Yeah, as if. Okay. It's only about 100 feet to the station, all right? As soon as I get in there I can try and hail somebody on the short wave. Hang in there, okay? All right. Hey, y'all, there's something moving in there. What the hell? Is that one of us? I think it's Rick. Yeah. Bernard! Bernard? Bernard! What happened? Come on, come on. - Hurry, come on. - Come on. Come on. Where's Rick? He didn't make it. We watched him go into Bernard's and... Oh, my God. What is going on? Georgia, have you been keeping an ear on the radio? Yeah, but there's nothing. Nothing? Nothing. Nothing from Joe or Liz? Nothing. Mom, do you think we can call out? Best we could do is broadcast out and hope somebody driving by has their radio on. Yeah, that's a hell of a long shot. But it could work. You got any more shells for that? The two shells I just spent have been sitting in this thing for seven years. Why the fuck would I have any more shells? Okay, Georgia. Well, I have more shells but they're back at the station. Yeah. Mom, you got here with no problem, so maybe Teddy can get back down a few doors without issue. How many of them are there? We don't even know, do we? Do we even know what they want? There was something else. What do you mean, Cindy? There is something in those trees. It got Rick. What like another one of those people? No, no. It was like something inhuman. I'm gonna have to go to the station. Teddy, you can't. It's okay, Deanna. It's my job. All right, y'all are gonna have to stay here. Hold this place down. As soon as I leave you lock this place up, you understand, Bobby? All right. Deanna, you still have that radio? Yeah, okay. All right, I can use this to call you guys from the station but you won't be able to respond. Take this. Do you a lot more good than us. Georgia, what the hell am I gonna do with an empty shotgun? Look, I got another pistol in the office. I'll get you some more shells for that and then I'll hustle back here. And then what? As soon as the sun comes up I will walk us outta here if I have to. Okay. What are they doing? What are they doing? What the hell? They're feeding whatever's in there. I'm not so sure going out there is the best. Must've gone out back, I'm gonna make sure it's locked. Come on. Okay. Come on. Come on. Get the hell inside now! Come on, come on! Jesus Christ! Joe, you're alive! Oh yeah. Here. Anybody comes through that door, you kill it. Where's Liz? What the hell's going on here, Joe? Oh, haven't you heard? Some asshole said some fancy words and raised a goddamn demon outta hell. What the hell do they want? Ain't it obvious? We saw them feeding it. There you go. Serving us up like dinner on a goddamn silver platter. Shit. They're even feeding it their dead. You saw it, didn't you, Joe? Up close and personal. How'd you get away from it? I wined it, dined it, and then I claymore mined it. Where were you? Bill's front yard. Joe. Look in the evidence locker. Holy shit. Where the hell did you get this? We caught Bill using it a couple years back trying to get rid of a mole problem. The sheriff before, he had to wrestle it away from him. Thank you, Bill. Where the hell are these guys? Who's left? We've got Cindy, Georgia, Bobby and Deanna all locked in at the grille. All right. You gotta make sure that they stay alive, and when the time is right, you're gonna get them outta town. How am I gonna do that? Oh, we're gonna level the playing field. Where they feeding him at? Uh, last we saw it was over at Bernard's tree farm, but shit, it could be anywhere by now. Rick told me you were a good football player. Is that true? I was back in high school, why? I want you to run straight up the middle, draw as many of those Michael Myers wannabes with you as you can. Okay. Who's Michael Myers? Oh, for Christ's sakes just holster this thing up. What are you gonna do? Oh, I have a date with a big toothy horny monster and it's about to get fucked! Okay, okay. Georgia. I'm over at the sheriff's station and Joe's here, he's, he's alive. I'm on the way back to you, Georgia. God, I hope you can hear this. You better be ready to get that door open. Mom, Mom. Bobby, no! Oh, my God. Go get some towels! - Bobby, Bobby. - Here, here, here. How did he stab him? Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, look at me. Duct tape or any other kind of tape. I don't see any. Breathe, Bobby. Breathe, breathe. Breathe, Bobby. - Bobby, look at me. - Really tight. It's gonna be okay. You'll be okay. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - No, no, no, no, no. Don't say that, don't say that. There's nothing to be sorry for. Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby. It's okay, it's okay. Just breathe son. Deanna, put some pressure on him. Bobby, stay with me. Look at me, look at me. Look at me. Bobby. It's all right, you're gonna be okay. Bobby, Bobby, come back to me. Come back. - It's okay. - I'm okay. Just breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe. No, slow, slow. It's okay, it's okay. It'll be okay. You're gonna be okay. Bobby. - Teddy, come here. - Get in, get in! God damn! Okay, come! - You're okay. - Okay. - Yeah? - I'm okay. I'm okay. Yeah. Is he? Yeah. He died just a few minutes ago. I'm sorry. It's not your fault. - I'm sorry. - It's not your fault. I was just... Help me. Joe. Joe's still out there. Come on! Is that all of 'em? Yeah, I think so. How's your night going, Sheriff? I think it's gonna be okay. You all right, deputy? Yeah, I think I'll be all right. Good. What now, Joe? Well, I think we should get the hell out of here and find the next biggest town, do we all agree? Sounds like a plan. Yeah. We gotta find a car that has a battery in it. Well, then let's go do that. So, how do you like small towns, Sheriff? Think we could take the subway? Wow, what's going on in the next town over? Seems to be a lot of police action. No one cares about us small town folks, Sheila. Hell, that's why I moved to Ingram. Couldn't stand the crowds and tourists and all that capitalism. Not for me. You're just such a sourpuss. That's what they say. Uh, what can I do for ya today? Well, you can tell me about your quaint little town here. Thank you. Pretty interesting story, miss. Well, it's all true. Have you talked to Teddy? Or Joe? Sheriff Anderson? Yeah. Yeah, we have. Then you know everything. Well, it's a rather farfetched story, certainly you can understand that. But not untrue. Do you know where the bodies are? The tree farm. Have you checked the tree farm? Yeah. Yeah, we did. Yeah, there was nothing there. Miss, to be honest, there's no evidence that anyone was there other than your own townsfolk. What? We know something happened, that you got missing people, that's a fact. What about Georgia? She would never of left her son's side, she had to been there when you got there, right? Georgia's missing. We don't know where at. Dead. So what you're saying. Let the truth be told you all have the same story, but there's no real evidence of what happened other than a bunch of you small town folk going a bit crazy coming up with a very bizarre account of events. So, help me here. What is it you're not telling us? It doesn't matter what I tell you, you won't believe what we saw until you see for yourself.
