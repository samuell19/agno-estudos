I dedicate it to my mother present Starring - Good morning Mr. Marek. - To Gdansk? Uh-huh. Have some fresh cod! Introducing ALL WILL BE WELL Written by Edited by Sound If we had the money, she'd have the surgery, yes? - It's not about money. - But what? Someone older should come. Like who? An uncle, aunt... but not a minor. - I don't have any... - Hello. So nothing can be done? Everything's in God's hands. This means that mom... Sometimes things turn out contrary to medical logic. Miracles happen, then? Yes, but very rarely. Executive Producer Co-producers Director of Photography Producer Directed by - How's Mom? - Fallen asleep. No, I haven't! Come here one of you! Don't shout. Here I am. I don't shout. What I'd like is howl rather than shout. I have to conk out because of you here. Fill these at the drugstore. But be quick. Fucking asshole! Well? - What did you shit do? - Sorry. Sorry? Say it to them! They spit their lungs out and you screw up, but want to go to Germany. - Never again, sir. - Very good. Never again. You're right. But you aren't going. - Fill in for him. - No! Please. I want fucking blood and sweat... rather than tears. A gift from the druggist. A bonus. - What's this? - Shark extract... ...especially for you to make you stronger. Step on it... till the end! Good! - Well... - Not bad... 3:25. Could've been 3:20 but I had to run in the morning. - Why? - I had to. What you must do is practice not fuck around. If you clock less than 3:20 no Kraut will catch up with you. I may be a repeater. - How's school? - History's OK, but math, poor. If you defeat the Krauts, I'll take care of it. You will? - Mom's worse. - That's the doctors' concern. They're experts. Your concern's the meet. Get it? Tomorrow at 10. Don't be late! They're even worse. - Am I to watch a gator? - Then what? Turn it off. Be quiet. Don't make me repeat it! Go in Christ peace. Thank the Lord. Father, could I stay awhile? I want to pray for Mother. - For Mom? - Sure. All right. When you're over, lock everything and fetch the keys. Watch out for the scaffolding. There... Thank you. Mother promised a hundred times to walk... ...to the Black Madonna shrine on her knees. If Father drank himself into his grave at last. She's never done it though. It's just worked out that way. If You could help once again and have Mother recover... Mom, that is... I'll do everything that Mom's promised. Just make her recover. I know You can. So help me God and the Holy Trinity. Amen. - We've finished already. - So help yourself to some fish. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - What do you think? - I don't know. - A good idea or not? - I don't know! - If I decide, will you help me? - Yeah... A fine piece of ass! - Samantha... - Yeah. - There's money here. - We don't take that! Off we go! Coming! Parole officer! Another summons. Mr. Henio, come on... For the love of God. - Come on in. - Greetings. Come on in, please. What then? So... Sons of bitches. Well, it's vacation time. I may have left. Sure thing. - I haven't seen you for a month. - Well... Your health. That's right. So long. - Hi, cunt chasers! - Hello. - So you'll repeat class. - Mother's more important. - They won't take you to Germany. - I know. Let's run at last. - What is it? You all right? - Yeah. Oh, fuck it! The jars! My boys have run away from home. So what? They're sure to be back. See what they've left me? Mom: We're gone to ask the Black Madonna to help you recover. We'll be back. Paulie and Peter. Smart asses both. So what? Why don't you do something? Why worry? They haven't gone far. They've taken away half the number of jars. - The asphalt's melting. - Yeah. - Name? - Kwiatkowski. - That's your brother Peter? - Yes. Get in the car. Quick! Never do it again. Promise! It's to no avail. You hear? You pulled a fast one on the Virgin Mary. I heard you wish Father'd drink himself into his grave. You pity him? You forget how he'd harm you? He chucked your fish tank out the window. - And who'd beat up Peter? - Father was ill. - It's me who's ill. - In school they said alcoholism is a disease. Nobody tried to help him. Everyone shouted at him. And Granny the most. Don't pick on Granny! At night I'd hear you say you'd walk on your knees to the shrine - if he drank himself into his grave. - Just a way of speaking. Blathering nonsense while the Virgin is listening! That's rubbish. Didn't She help us? She did! And you turned your back on Her. - Don't blaspheme! - I'm talking about you. She'll help us anyway! The priest said the pilgrimage would be passing by in 2 days. Join in if you like. - You hear? - I do. Mother thinks you deceived her. When she talked about the pilgrimage, I said nothing. That's all. Why don't we join in? The pilgrimage walks slowly and her strength is ebbing away. I'm scared. You think I'm not? - Hi, cunt chasers! - Hi! So little? It's taken you half a day! I'll go along with you. No, that's a stupid idea. She'd be left all alone. The old Marczak would help her. What if something happened at night? All right. What will you do? I'll manage. I'll get some food and off I go! Peter! Hello. Paulie's missed the training again. What's up? Is he running again? - Yes or fucking not?! - No... er... yes, that is. That fucking shit! Paulie! Paulie! - I know you're there! Come out! - I won't! - I won't run after you. - You wouldn't catch me anyway. That's cigarettes for you! You'd like to light up two at a time now, huh? You know what you can lose? The meet, repeat exams... Everything! - Get your ass into the car! - Mother's most important. - I'm calling the police. - Didn't you have a mother? All right! I won't! Tell me why the hell you keep running? You'll fuck up everything and make Mom worried. - I want her to recover. - If she worries, she'll get worse. She's as ill as ill can be. So I'll take you along to ask her, dammit! You fucking asshole! Yes? Anka? Hi. It's me. Hi. Wait. - You sober? - I beg you, please. - I got interesting copy for you. - What's in it for you? Something's bizarre happening, so I thought about you. I can't remember you acting with no interest in mind. - So you want to know or what? - Then tell me. - Was there enough beer? - Exactly. Four cans of beer and chocolate bars... Also four. A Band-Aid or something. A Band-Aid... - Peroxide too? - Uh-huh. A paper perhaps... - Which? - A cheapo. Promotion gift. From the basilica. - Why have you stopped? - I'm not going back. Who says? All right. - Why're you following me, then? - You can run and I can drive. You won't take me back? - No. - Word of honor? Why staying put? You are supposed to run! New shoes for such running? The old ones have worn out. What you need is use your noodle. You'll run from 6 till 9 am. With breaks every 20 min. Same in the evening. I have to hurry. If you hurry, you'll run out of steam. - Where will you sleep at night? - In barns along the way... And food? - I got some. - To last you how long? Why are you following me? I don't know. I must've lost my mind. - Want a chocolate bar? - Sure. Here. - We'll sleep in the car tonight. - Cool. I've never. But I'll still run a little. Distance is distance. Must you quaff the beer all the time? Sleep, OK?... To feel rested. Father started with beer too. And later... everyone knows. Nothing's started with me. Everyone says so. One was so sure of himself they had to have him tied. Yeah... Will you manage two days without beer? Sure. That's what Father used to tell Mom. And what? All he endured was one day. - Am I your father? - No. Then sleep. - Yes? - Hi. This is Anka. The boss OK'd it, but not earlier than in 2 days. - Thank you. - Don't let me down. - Me? How? - You know it well. That young kid needs care. Don't worry. Sobriety is my credo. Yeah? Then I'm a Bolshoi Theater ballerina. - Could you pull over? - What's up? Turn into that dirt road. What're you doing? We're going nowhere. You're completely drunk. - Gimme the keys. - No. You're as drunk as a fish. You stupid? I'm beat. It's the heat. I'll rest alwhile, because I won't manage... Fuck it! Paulie! Paulie! Nothing to drink? Where's the beer? - There's none. - How come? Where the hell have you hidden it? I've poured it out. You freaked out, weirdo? Nobody's gonna beat me. Stop! Where are you running? I'm sorry. That's what I thought. You didn't endure, like Father. Don't you recall anything? You were so soaked... that I had to snatch the keys out of the ignition. You could've killed someone. You're a teacher, not some lowlife. You won't drink anymore, OK? Or else we'll have reached the shrine by December. You promised not to drink... not at the wheel at least. I promise not to drink on the road. - Swear to God. - A lesson of religion, this?! So swear on your mother. I swear to God. Remember, this pledge is no rubbish. - Been to the drugstore, Peter? - Not yet. Dammit... I asked you 2 hours ago. I'm dying of pain and he can't get there for half a day. I'm making you breakfast. For so long? When he's back, I'll let that damned shit have it. To leave his ill mother with a twerp. Mind your talking about him. He's run there because of you. He could not stand it here. That's why. Not at all! And you know it well! Well, not so bad given such a distance. Now the calves. That's what I thought. We'll have to get salve, magnesium pharmaceutical, carrots, bananas... I'll manage. I'll endure anyway! Breakfast. You've lifted them? - Necessity. - Thievery. Call a spade a spade. But they're sweet. Yes, indeed. But thievery is thievery. Stretch-out exercise. Nothing will happen if he misses some veggies. They're not yours! So hands off! - Hello. - Anka... - Where are you now? - Wait a minute, please. Let's decide where we catch up with you. At a motel maybe? Still 4 km and we call it a day. What? Hold on to the wheel or you'll fall out the window. It hasn't gone? There are these tablets. When Dad had the shakes, Mom would go to the drugstore and they disappeared. No more money. About $5 left. Enough to buy them. - Stop it! - As you please. Look at your hands shake. Let's try another way. You have to tire a lot. When Father'd cut firewood, the shakes would go. Worry about your cramps, OK? Wait here. Gdansk Regional TV A shot. And another maybe. Cigarettes... I see you've already met. Hi. Hi. Let's have a coffee and talk. Coffee's a problem. We're nearly broke. On me, then. Come, kid. No. When Mother sees me, she'll kill me. Why, you're running for her, no? When this material goes national, someone may happen to help you. We'll open a bank account so money could be donated for her treatment. Only the Virgin Mary can help her. The doctor said nothing could be done. We can only wait for a miracle. First, doctors err very often. Second, if one of them doesn't know what to do, there will be others. But let's give it a try, OK? Well... Then think it over. All right. Come, then. We'll talk outdoors. I'll wait here. - Your order, sir? - One more coke... ...and a shot of inexpensive brandy. Paulie is incredible. He really believes he has a deal with the Virgin Mary. That's what it looks like. Something's odd here... Why you doing this? Miracle. The Virgin Mary must have worked hard. If I look for a press spokesperson, I won't hire you. Right you are. Back to the motel. Right, but we sleep in the car. Paulie can move in. I have two beds. Unlike me, he likes to sleep in the car. Then you have a problem. You've never did it before. Man, it's the power of TV. All right. Off you go. Ready! Paulie! Here! The last one, dammit! - Where did you get it? - She gave it to me. - Wow! Then we live! - And how! We got food and medicine. A spray medication, salve... Swedish, so it must be good. They sold you beer too? Yeah... To fill my prescription not to let me freak out with you. Good. Show me your legs. - You promised not to drink. - Not on the road. Now we go to sleep. She asked me about you too. What did you tell her? I wouldn't manage without you. You said it right. ...to the Black Madonna. Still there are miles of struggle and pain before him. When it's tough, he repeats, "I must run". Will Paulie save his mother. A lot depends on your good will. That's why we've opened a bank account... ...whose number you'll see with the credits. You've bowed down your head, like a horse. Rather than join in the pilgrimage, he's running by himself. I don't know. Prevaricating, huh? I see it. I'll kill you both some day, hotheads. Give me tea. Carry on! What's wrong? I don't know. No more strength. - Legs? - A stitch. Come on. Just trot and it will go. Breathe regularly. Wait. Here. Better? - Are we running or not? - I can't. You've bought it for me? That's mine. Family heirloom. After your mom? Better now? So let's run. Let's run. When my wife watched it, she cried like stupid. What did he say? I only saw the end. That he's running for you to recover. That's his deal with the Virgin Mary. And his coach follows him in the car. Who? That alcoholic? Who doesn't drink in this country? It's nice of him to be following your son, no? Once, on a mountain hike, he nearly lost the kids. - Drunkard! - But this is a flat land. Flat? It doesn't mean a thing yet, but we've been receiving calls to air the reportage again. - This time on Channel One. - Wonderful. How's Paulie? Fine, he keeps on running, the others are singing. You squandered away a hundred in two days? One third for the salve and spray. And the fruit... - And for the beer? - Yeah. Four grand. Don't shout. Wait. Chief... I have this car radio... - What? Only $17? - It's seen better days. - Gimme. - Why? You'll drink all of it away. And we'll have shit. Here. Fuck it! What have I stepped in... You'll shit your pants rather than make it. - I will. It'll hurt at the most. - Yeah. When infection sets in, I'll drive you to hospital... If you soak so much, who will drive whom? If this doesn't help by tomorrow, we go back. I can't. Neither can I. Why not? I wanna make it with you, no? I see. How are you? I'm fine. - It's the worst then. - Why? When dad said 'fine', he'd go on a bender. And was back a week later. How are you today? Praised be Jesus Christ. You scoundrel... you. Nothing doing. - You know what? - Yeah? Oh, nothing. Finish what you start. You hand everything to me. My father never did that. I had to pick everything myself. Once, I asked him to give me cocoa. He wouldn't either. Sometimes he was quite nice and would muss up my hair. You're dressed? Then run. Where did you get it? - Don't be scared. Not for the money. - Stolen again? Once more and I'll make you puke it. - Get it? - I was hungry. - We have money. - But little. So you have to steal? They're making a film about you for TV. Runs for his mom and pilfers what he can. Just chocolate bars. When Father was thirsty, he'd batter Mother. To make him stop, I'd run to the store to lift beer, or denatured alcohol. At the end, he was only on the latter. But you don't have to now. - And what if they'd caught you? - Don't worry. They won't catch me. You know how hard it is to lift beer? The salesman always keeps it close at hand. And chocolate bars? Piece of cake. Be quiet. Careful now. Drive to her to suggest a surgery in his clinic. It's metastatic. but she'll , be operate on anyway. Don't tell Paulie anything. Got that? He'll try his darned est when he hears that. Have it your way... Good. Thanks. Be hearing from you. If I know anything more,I'll call you. - Bad news now. - What happened? The superintendent of schools called. One Adamski is going to visit you. - You know him? - Sort of... Very cross with you. - Yeah? - Uh-huh. He'll pick you apart. - Everyone picks on me. - I wonder why... Bye. Bye... Look, Ann... Paulie! - What? - Stop here. Good news now. - What? I don't know anything. - Our foundation opened a bank account. It was on TV. A lot of money has been donated. We turned to a clinic. The lady doctor has cooperated with us for years. Good morning. And what? We'll take you to our clinic... ...for a detailed examination and we'll decide then. - Remember everything? - I do. - You'll manage, son? - I'll manage. Right. You're a big boy now. Go to Mrs. Marczak if you don't know something. What's the matter? Fuck it! You realize of course that you jeopardize the boy's health. That's not so. He's so dead-set on it that he'd be running even without me. All I do is help him. Without you, he'd be driven home by the police at once. Though the mother agrees, your superiors don't approve of the idea. None of their business. It's vacation time. Let's say it's a sports camp. But if we don't accept it, it's illegal then. What if something happens to him? Who'll answer for that? I have my coach license, been teaching for 13 years. Please trust me. Let's stop pulling wool... You're the last one I could trust. Everyone knows you're alcoholic. But for your headmaster's dreams of those cups from Leipzig, you'd have been fired long ago. So what? Get the boy in the car and drive him to his mother. But she's in hospital thanks to that TV program. - To take him to the hospital? - Home! The party's over. Get it? It's over. - Will you tell it to him? - You'll do it yourself. You know what I think? You can fuck yourself. That's what you think? If I hit you in that fat snout, you won't do a thing to me. Two million people have watched it. If you want to fire me, TV will make such a program that you prick will be fired not me. Good... I'll wait. In a few months, everyone will forget the boy and we'll talk then. Hey, you! Pay your check. We've decided to operate, which won't be easy. If you agree... naturally. I'll die without the surgery? I agree. Now I know why your son is so brave. I have this request, doctor. I want to confess. All right. I'll tell the priest. Paulie, wait! The car's broken down. What now? The battery's died too. I have to run. - We must do something about it! - We have no time. Let me see where we are. Somewhere here. This big village some 12 km away should have a mechanic. I'm running. - Leaving me fucking alone?! - I must! Wait there for me! There's no mechanic here. - You've asked around? - Sure. Thanks. We can't leave her here. We'll leave her with the village council chair... I'll ask where he lives. - Cold? - Sure. - What's this? Stolen? - No. You'll puke it out now. Throw up or I take you back there to return what you've lifted. In a pig's eye. Didn't I tell you not to? All you say is rubbish. The superintendent told me. He talked to you? - He did. - What did he say? You're with me or else you'll be fired. - That's the truth. - Now it's the truth? What do you think? I've come along because you're so beautiful? - I thought nothing! - So what's the point? I do my thing and help you at the same time. All right. Let's go to the council chair. Don't steal any more, moron. If they catch you, no more donations. Got that? - Do you happen to have a bike? - Sure. - Could you lend it? - Why? I don't know you. I can sell it. Worth ca. $ 70. How would I know? Wiesio! Come here! The man wants to buy the bike. Enough? Too little. Plus my cell. Wouldn't you rather run than ride that? You crazy? I can't remember the last time I ran. They say you used to be a champ. So they say, but then many untoward coincidences cropped up. Vodka and smokes. Those are untoward coincidences. Let's go. But slowly. Not to have me spit my lungs out. - We got to go the distance. - Sure, sure! You poison yourself again, huh? I thought it was the chief nurse. Your son... So skinny. No wonder he runs and runs. "... in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the price". What? St. Paul wrote that in 1 Corinthians. He wrote about running? Yeah. Could you help me read that saint? Everything is written here. Yes, everything's written here. Don't burn holes in it. - What's up? - Nothing. What if I'm imagining all of this? What do you mean? You crazy? Maybe miracles don't come true? Why all this then? You begin to doubt, having run 2/3 of the distance? - You made a vow, no? - To the Virgin Mary. So what's the point? - Your mother ever deceived you? - Many a time... But not the Virgin Mary. Well! I understand... but I'm her husband. Her ex. My cell has been stolen. I know that you... Just tell Ann... that Andrew called. Yes, Andrew. We're going to Turkwia. To Turkwia. "T" as in twat! Thank you very much. Don't be afraid. Some wait for months to get here. You know that Paulie is running for me? He knows what he's doing. I guess so. I have everything marked here. But I don't know where exactly. Dammit! "Let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us. " St. Paul wrote this. And Paulie says this. He's never read the Holy Bible. Just rang the bells as an altar boy. But he knows. That's wonderful. I'll tell him about you if you want. No need really... Thank you. Why not? Everyone does. Something's the matter with you. Dark circles under your eyes the wedding ring on the other hand. Everyone could use the Virgin Mary. Maybe so, let's get back to you. As Paulie is running for me. I don't need anything. - How's Mom? - The surgery's soon. And how's Peter? No idea. Here. All right. OK, I'll ask someone to visit him. I promise. - You're Peter, yes? - Yes. I'm Viola. - May I? - Sure. Viola, Viola... Must be Samantha! Yes? Good. Yes, sir. Andrew. Visitors tonight. And some money to earn. Virgin Mary, I'd like to help, but I can't. I'm too stupid. A stupid one needs more help. Yes! Dear Sir... No. You don't understand the offer. But I do. You'll run in a T-shirt and a cap with the word Burstar - and will get $ 7000 for it. - Mr. Andrew said those drinks are rubbish. Just a teaspoonful of salt, soda, and some vitamins. That's all. It's wheedling money out of the people. Mr. Andrew does not mean our drink, right? Ours different. It really helps. But the ingredients are the same? The Mother and Child Institute endorses us. Is something the matter? I've caught a cold. Hence the shivers. I run for Mother to get better, not to earn money. I have an agreement with the Virgin Mary: When I make it, she'll recover. Excuse us. You flipped out. It's loads of dough. Tough luck. - You won't take it? - Would you? Well... I would. Here's our hero! Well? - Deal? - Well? No. - I thought you'd persuaded him. - So did I. What now?... Excuse me? Nothing. - What? - When the kid says no, it's no. Get out of here. Let him be. Yeah? We won't build Poland in this way. - $8000? - Please! $ 7000 wasted! - You've got pissed? - No... I just wonder at myself. But you feel why I can't take that? Yeah... I must've flipped out too... The face he made, huh? Yeah. - How long on the wagon? - Almost 3 days. Great! Here. The tablets. I've bought them. Thanks. Water, Paulie? Yes! Sir. I'm Peter Kwiatkowski. ... Paulie's brother... My brother's running, to beg the Virgin Mary to make Mom get well. He has these repeat exams in history and math. I'd like you to put them off. When he makes it, he'll pass them. I'll rake the playing field and do whatever you want. My regards, Peter Kwiatkowski. Peter, I know who you are. Yes. Don't worry about those repeat exams. We're all proud of your brother. - You agree, sir? - Yes! Of course. We're flying! - May I call to him? - After the surgery. Right. I don't even know the number. I didn't run and exert myself in vain. Excuse me? What's the matter? Something happened. What? I don't know. - Something happened. - To whom? If so, they would've called us. Really? For sure. You look much better. It's the exercise. Yes? Wait... What?! You've really turned a somersault! It'll heal in no time. - Paulie? - Yes? Your mom has had a surgery today. Is that so? - We're going home. - I must run like I promised. - But it's pointless. - I must run. You've made it. You didn't get it and never will. Maybe I should have run faster? Or much earlier... in July or at the end of June, right after they gave us the report cards. Or was it a test? Yes? A test for sure. When the 3rd day's over, Mom will rise. It's a test to see if we believe or not. Just a pop quiz. You'll see. Mom fell asleep at 2 p. m. Three days will have passed in an hour. Then she'll rise. Look... I heard what you told your brother. And? Er... It's not so. - What do you mean? - Miracles. Impossible. How do you know what's possible or not for the Virgin Mary? You have the faith? The Resurrection happened only once when Christ walked about the world and made miracles. So it's possible. Well, no. Why did I run then to the Virgin Mary? To ask her for a miracle. No? You knew it all along. Yes, a miracle to make her recover. - A miracle... - What's the difference? You believe in some miracles and not in others? A miracle is a miracle. The top of the coffin should be unscrewed. All will be well. Smile please. It's 2 p. m. It may have been a moment later... So now to the orphanage. She promised we'll be in the same one. Why don't you say anything? Look! He may not be breathing. We must do something. The Virgin Mary won't help him for sure. - Where am I? - With us. We've brought your bag too. And my clothes...? What about them? It's a shitty idea, gentlemen. And so am I. It tallies. Cast of Characters
