C.S. Lewis once said, "Since it is so likely that children will meet cruel enemies, let them at least have heard of brave knights and heroic courage. Otherise, you're making their destiny not brighter, but darker." [LIGHT MUSIC] Another great man of faith, John Bunyan, penned these words. "As I walked through the wilderness of this world, I lighted on a certain place where was a den, and laid me down in that place to sleep. And as I slept, I dreamed a dream. I dreamed and behold, I saw a man clothed with rags, standing in a certain place, with his face from his own house, a book in his hand, and a great burden upon his back. I looked, and saw him open the book and read therein; and as he read, he wept and trembled; and not being able longer to contain, he brake out with a lamentable cry, saying, 'What shall I do?'" [LIGHT MUSIC] I'm Kristyn Getty, and my husband, Keith, and I have the privilege of making music. We write and perform hymns that remind us of what it is we believe, and who we truly worship. Songs such as "In Christ Alone" and "Facing A Task Unfinished" connect us with the generations that have gone before us, and stir our affections for the right things, while giving us the strength to walk the straight path. John Bunyan, over 300 years ago, was in prison for twelve years because of his faith. While he was locked away from his family in a cold, dark place, his imagination was stirred to write the allegory of "The Pilgrim's Progress." Imagination is what gives us the ability to visualize the things that we cannot see. It is how we see, hear, taste, and smell things that make up our world, even when they are nowhere near us. To see the creativity of our God, one only has to look around at the world in which we live. The changing colors and leaves, the way the sun paints the sky when a day begins and ends. God is creative and created us to be, as well. Reason, knowledge, and logic are important. We need to be inquisitive, ask questions, and seek to understand. But logic and reason alone are not enough. To know about Christ is not the same as to know Him. Our faith is not about what we know. It's about who we know. Facts set a foundation, and our imagination makes those facts personal to us and leads our hearts to sing. As Christians, we need vivid imaginations. From Genesis to the final Revelation, the Bible paints pictures, makes analogies, and uses parables. It engages our imaginations to help us understand what our King wants us to know about Him, about us, and about our journey from this life to the next. God gave us an imagination and teaches us with it and connects with us through it. Now, children have the ability to tap into this gift in a way that we often lose as adults. We must encourage the use of imagination in understanding our faith and in connecting with our Creator. You, child of the King, you are a brave knight walking this path through a world that is full of troubles, and you have a King that always sends help when needed. Use your imagination. Allow yourself to be lost in the story of "The Pilgrim's Progress" because this is actually your story. It is the journey you began when you chose to leave behind the City of Destruction and make your way on the King's Road. Let your imagination explore this story in a new way, because its lessons will give you the strength to fight the very real troubles that your journey through this world will bring. Things are not always what they seem, and sometimes life's tumbles can lead you to the most interesting of places. [HEAVY DRAMATIC MUSIC] Many years ago, in the realm of Apollyon, past the garden of four rivers, and in the region of Abaddan, there stood an old city. Its name in the ancient tongue was Noit Curtsed. But time and speech and a brilliant mind named Lux soon set upon the more pleasant name of Not Cursed. Though some would have thought it wishful thinking, for the city was indeed cursed with perpetual decay, leaving the inhabitants no choice but to labor perpetually for the very sake of their existence. Years, decades, and centuries passed, and the city grew in number and labor. Ruling over it were the Supervisors, descendants of Lux. Brilliant organizers, they kept the city in existence by the oversight of endless shifts and schedules. Obstinate Heady. Next. Christian Pilgrim. Next. [CHRISTIAN SIGHS] [GASP] Oh! Work was paramount, which is why such a commotion resulted one day when it was discovered that-- A man has gone missing! What? Stand back, now. [THUD] Once more and-- [CRASH] [SOFT MUSIC] Whoa. Oh, my. Tear it all down, and burn it. All of it. Hurry up, now. Supervisor 6 will be here any minute. And I'd be very careful if I were you. You want to avoid any contamination. [SOFT MUSIC] So, that's him. Right, you are. Faithful Pathfinder. Yeesh. What a madman. [SOFT MUSIC] [CHRISTIAN SIGHS] Well, you can't really blame a man for dreaming, can you, Obstinate? Even if he is a madman. Was a madman. Only a madman would be foolish enough to venture beyond the borders. Nothing good ever comes from veering from the rules, I always say. Nothing at all. Beyond the borders? Is that where he went? Yes. And everyone knows there's nothing but death beyond the borders. Isn't that right, uh-- what is your name? Christian, Supervisor. I mean, Christian. You're the supervisor, obviously. And you don't want to catch the same thing Faithful Pathfinder did, do you? Whatever it is that drove him to this deviation. No. No, surely not. Of course not. Never. No. Good. Do not fail to collect every last scrap of paper. Every sketch, any notes. And you. Yes, my superior? I have a task for you. Right away, my superior. [LAUGH] [GENTLE MUSIC] [INSECTS CHIRPING] [WHOOSHING] [EXPLOSION] [GASPING] [SOFT MUSIC] [DOOR CREAKS] What was Faithful Pathfinder thinking, I wonder? It has been said that no one just finds the Book, but, rather, the Book finds them. And so it happened that Christian began to read. And read. And read. And read. Unable to pry himself from its pages, he read the Book all through the night and all the next day and the day after that. And the more he read, the more his concern for right things grew until they became, as it were, a great burden to him. Christian read about things he had never imagined, about kindnesses he had never known existed, about wrongful things that needed to be put right, about the origins of his city, and about a coming-- War?! We have to get out, Christiana. It says so in this, and I believe it in here. And the war will destroy the entire city? So we must flee and get to the-- Celestial City, the City of Light. The City of-- [LAUGH] It's a book, Christian. If you'd only read it, you would understand. It all makes-- [GROANS] Sense? You're asking me and the children to follow you beyond the borders? [SOB] No, Christian. It doesn't make sense. None at all. Ever since you started reading that Book a few days ago, you have gone on and on and on like some lunatic. "The city is going to be destroyed. The city is going up in flames." It's hard for me and for the children to see you in this sorry state, all bent over and-- It's this weight. Weight? What weight, Christian? You've gone to nothing but skin and bones. The more I read, the more it weighs on me. Don't you see? Oh, Christian. I know. This all seems crazy. I do. But I love you. And--and I only want what is best for us all. If the city is destroyed-- Oh. If the city is destroyed, I don't want you, the children, or anyone else for that matter to perish with it. I love you, Christiana. [SOFT MUSIC] Then, choose. What? Choose, Christian. The children, I, we can't take seeing you like this day in and day out. You're going to have to choose what you want to do. Stay here with us or leave. Because we're not going with you. We're not. [DOOR CREAKS OPEN] [DOOR SHUTS] [GENTLE MUSIC] [SIGH] [FOOTSTEPS] My superior. Any signs? Signs? Oh, lots. Why, there's one right here, you see. Of the missing man, you fool. Oh! Oh, oh, yes, yes. Of course. Well, uh, yes and no. Yes and no? We followed his footsteps beyond the borders, you see, to, um, to the Swamp of Despondency. So that's where he ended up. [LAUGHS] The swamp. Well, that's where the, uh, "no" part fits in, my-- What do you mean? Well, you see, his footsteps, they sort of led in and out of the swamp toward the, uh, outer realms. It seems that Faithful is alive. [GASP] [HEAVY MUSIC] Alive? Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. The Master won't be happy, will he? When I need to hear the obvious, I shall let you know. Oh, right. Of course. Mmm. We cannot afford to lose any more fools, certainly not before the war. But the Master must be told. Return to the city. Spread a rumor that something too horrible to recount befell Faithful. The less you say, the more their imagination will fill in the blanks. Ah! Brilliant. Yes, a brilliant plan. Go. I won't be long. Right away, my superior. Right away. [HEAVY MUSIC] [EERIE WHOOSHING] [GENTLE MUSIC] [GROWL] [OMINOUS MUSIC] Master? What is it? Master... I do not need to be reminded of my position. Yes, of course. One of your subjects, a man called Faithful, he has gone missing. Well, he hasn't really gone missing since we know he's gone to the outer realms. I see. I knew you would be understanding, Master. We do try our best to-- [SCREAM] What gives you the impression that I am understanding? I-- I-- I-- I-- I-- Get out! It won't happen again, Master, I can assure-- Creature. Master? Be vigilant. One fool has a tendency to engender another. [WHOOSHING] [GENTLE MUSIC] What am I doing? All I have is this--this map. What if I don't get back to the city in time to rescue them? What should I do? What should I do? I believe I can answer that question. I didn't see you there. That's because I just showed up. My name is Evangelist. Now, "What should I do?" you were asking. And I shall tell you. Flee. Flee? Don't hesitate. Don't waste time. Do what you know you must. You'll soon see with your eyes what you believe in your heart, and you'll get rid of that thing on your back. You can see it? Well, of course, I can, and I daresay a heavy and sickly burden it is. Oh, it seems to grow more by the day. As your sorrows do, dear lad, so does your burden. But you'll never get rid of it on your own, I guarantee you. Now, do you see that gate over there? [LIGHT MUSIC] Gate? Where? Come, come now. Don't wipe away your tears. Look through them. Sometimes tears have a way of bringing clarity. I still can't-- Look past your sorrow, good Christian. I-- oh. Wait. I think I see it. There, I do. Near the light. Good. Good. Now, listen to me. Keep that light in your eye, and go straight towards it. Do not turn to the right or to the left. Keep-- --on the straight path. Very good. Now, soon enough, you will come to the gate. The gate. And there, you will be told what to do. Now, go. All right. Quickly. Don't waste any more time. Run. Run? But why? Because the well-intended may not know what's best at all! That way! I think I hear him! What? Come on. Run! Right behind you! [TENSE MUSIC] There! I think I see him now! Christian! Christian! For goodness sake. [BOTH GRUNTING] Get over here. [BOTH PANTING] Obstinate? What are you doing here? Trying to keep you from making a greater fool of yourself than you already have. Your wife told me what happened, and-- I need to get to-- No, I will not let go until you promise to listen to reason. I must. Nope. Not budging. All right. All right. Finally. [LIGHT PLODDING MUSIC] Well, Pliable, thanks for being my backup. You got him. Well? Ready to go back? No. All right, then. Have a good trip. Get back here. Sure. And where are you going? I said I'd listen. I didn't say I'd stop. Oh, bother. Wait for me, Christian. And why on Earth would we leave all we love? Yeah. Why? Because it pales by comparison to all that the King of the Celestial City promises to his subjects-- fullness of joy in the presence of the King. Oh. No more sorrow. Whoa. Streets paved with gold. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! The city I leave behind is filled with evil and misery. He's got a point there. Will you be quiet? You're really not helping. All right. The city I seek is all goodness and joy and lasts forever. I want to find that city and come back to tell others how to get there. You can read about it all right here in the Book. See? No, I don't see. And quite frankly, I don't want to. That Book, which you should never have taken in the first place, has done nothing but set you on a journey to a dream. Speaking of which, it's getting late, and I miss my pillow. So, will you go with me or not, you stubborn-headed man? I was going to ask you the same thing. Well, I see you, too, are obstinate, though for all the wrong reasons. Come along, Pliable. Let him go on. We tried. Did you not hear me? Did you not hear him? Streets of gold. No more sorrow. What? Don't be a fool. All right. Well, then? Endless work. Things falling apart. Streets of gold. No more sorrow. Hmm. See ya. Well. I find no harm in changing my mind. Obviously. Are you sure you won't change yours, Obstinate? Do I look like I want to? You fools, walking to your death. Oh. Your poor wife and the Supervisors shall have my full report. So streets of gold, no more sorrow. Tell on. What else? Life unending. Peace of heart. Joy forever in the presence of the King. Shining garments. Oh, what bliss. What are we waiting for? Let's get there as soon as possible! [BOTH SHOUT] [HEAVY MUSIC] What is this? Oh. Mud? Mud? Pliable? Are you all-- take my-- I knew I shouldn't have listened to you. Here. Streets of gold. Shining garments. Shining garments. If this is what it's like to follow you in the beginning, how could it possibly be any better in the end? So much for your Book. I have no problem changing my mind. No, sir. Please! Help me! [TENSE MUSIC] [TWINKLING MUSIC] You called? Huh? I called for help. I didn't know what else to do. And I have come, for that is my name. Oh. Thank you. Better? Why didn't you use the steps? Steps? [GENTLE MUSIC] Covered again. The King placed them there to help people like you. But no sooner is the swamp drained that it fills to overflowing again with the fears, doubts, and discouragement of those that make it this far. So this is-- Yes. Looks like mud. Sticks like mud. And it'll keep a person down like mud. But it isn't. It's a mess of fears, the Swamp of Despondency. The place where people like your friend there give up before they even start. But it was right, you know. Right? To go back, I mean. But-- This journey you're embarking on, not for the double-minded. No, no. Not for the wishy-washy. Not at all. And this swamp, it's nothing compared to the trouble that's ahead. Let me ask you a question. Do you know the Celestial King? He sent me here. Have you seen the Celestial City? I surely have. Then step aside. I know the way will be rough. I've read about that in the Book. I can only hope for the King's help as I continue on my journey, which I am determined to complete. And I need no convincing, Christian, for I have no doubts that you have turned your face to the light and are not looking back. Continue your trek. And do not forget. Help, in some form or another, is never far away. Thank you, again, for-- [GRUNTS] It's mud. You still had a little bit of mud on you. [CLEARS THROAT] Farewell! Remember-- help, in some form or another, is never far away. [HEAVY MUSIC] Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Another man has gone... Oh. You've heard already. Yes, I did. And so has the Master, obviously. He has gone beyond the swamp into the outer realms. So there's nothing we can do. Oh, but there is. In the outer realms, we cannot impede him. But we can dissuade him with fear, with doubt, with pride. There are many, many persuasions. [LAUGHS] [BOTH LAUGHING] [SOFT MUSIC] What I wouldn't do to get rid of this thing. I'd give anything in the world to-- [LIGHT TWINKLING MUSIC] Whatever is the matter, dear boy? And what in the world is that awful thing on your back? I'm actually on my way to-- Where are my manners? Worldly's the name. Worldly first, Wiseman last, of course. Don't ever mix them up. You were saying? That I am on my way to the Celestial City by way of the gate, where I hope to get rid of this burden which is getting bigger by the hour. Oh, and you would do well to do that, dear boy. But-- Yes? Well, who told you you could get rid of that over there? A good man that came upon me in my hour of need, Evang-- --gelist, of course. Oh, dear, dear, dear. [TSKS] What is it? And you've already come all this way. Oh, dear, dear, dear. Well, what? It's just that this Evangelist-- Yes? Well, he's a little-- [COOING] So he's-- Yes, he is. Loony as a bird. The poor chap has his head in the clouds. Oh, no. So what on Earth was this Evangelist thinking, sending you in that direction? Full of nothing but trouble and danger, which I can see by the scratches and the tears and the mud, you've already experienced. So don't go that direction, which is silly nonsense. But you go in this direction, which is not. But-- No "but." Do not argue with me. You listen. So you keep going that way. [LIGHT PLODDING MUSIC] Good boy. You keep going that way, and do not stop. No matter what things begin to look like, just go in the direction I tell you until you get to a village called Morality. There, you will find the Hill. You will know you're at the Hill because the signs will tell you. There, not at that silly gate you were telling me about, you will be told how to get rid of that ugly thing. [HEAVY MUSIC] Who goes there? I say, who goes there? My name is Christian. I was told to ask for a gentleman by the name of Legality. A man, I am, of sorts. But gentle, I am not. [LAUGHS] I was told that you could get rid of this-- Stop your blubbering, and get on with it. I've haven't got all day. That you could get rid of this burden for me. Indeed, I can. Oh. Well, then, please. Will you? Well, I can't very well come down to you now, can I? I am a mountain! You will have to come to me. But how? Follow the instructions. Which ones? All of them, of course. Which ones? [LAUGHS] But there are too many. Too many? Too many? Why, can there ever be enough? [CHRISTIAN WHIMPERS] Come now. You want that burden off, don't you? Come to me. But-- Do as I say. Come, now. You're still too far away. I can hardly see you now. Keep up, man. Keep up. I can't do the work for you. You missed a sign there. You missed one, I say. I can't. [CHRISTIAN SCREAMS] You expect me to help you when you cannot even help yourself? On your feet. Oh. What am I going to do? [FOOTSTEPS] [GASP] Uh-oh. How is it you've turned out of the way so quickly? I don't know. Ha! Oh, dear. Ow! Come on. Let's get you out from under all that. Commandments cannot give you what you seek, Christian. They will only be a reminder that you are not able to keep them all. Legality can never rid you of your burden, you know. Say what? I said-- I'll show you what I can do. Prepare to see my power, you wretched man. Christian! Run! Bury you are under the weight of my power, I will, and rid the world of your burden and you. [LEGALITY GRUNTS] [CHRISTIAN SHOUTS] [LEGALITY LAUGHS] [TENSE HEAVY MUSIC] [COUGHING] Here we are. When Legality comes toppling down, we are catapulted to the way, the way that you left off following. It wasn't really my fault. Oh, I see. A man I met, a Mr. Worldly-- Ah. That scoundrel. Well, he said there was an easier way to get rid of my burden. And I-- well, I-- Was led out of this way. I thought-- You thought the King was leading you down a wrong path. Well, no. I-- You brought this misery upon yourself by rejecting the very instructions the King sent to you, Christian. You're right. It is my fault. I had no business listening to Worldly Wiseman. It's no one's fault but mine. And I'm sorry. I'm-- Forgiven. What? I'm-- Forgiven. If tears are any indication of regret, yours are. The King has said every misstep will be forgiven. Now, stand up. Continue the journey, for you have no time to lose. But learn, Christian, that there are two things this deceiver caused you to do. The first is that he caused you to so easily go out of the way and, second, that he made the difficulty of your journey something you wanted to avoid. Now, off to the gate with you. And remember, good Christian, do not leave the path again. [LIGHT MUSIC] [OMINOUS MUSIC] You failed miserably. But I got him to go out of the way. And then you left him. In the hands of Worldly Wiseman and Legality. I was certain he would be caught in their maze. He was ours. He was ours. And now he is not. [RUMBLING] [SHOUT] [GROWLING] What would you have me do? Get the others. Send out the legion. Do what you must. Yes, Master. Yes. Do not let him near that gate. Stop him. Stop him! [INTENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC] [SOFT FOREBODING MUSIC] [RUSTLING] [SOFT GROWL] [PANTING] Oh. Calm down. [INTENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC] [SCREAM] [GROWL] [CREATURES GROWLING] [SCREAM] The gate. [LAUGHS] At last. [LIGHT MUSIC] [HEAVY DRAMATIC MUSIC] [CREATURES SCREECHING] Help will come in some form or another. Help will-- help! Help! [ETHEREAL MUSIC] Knock, and it will be-- [CREATURES GROWLING] Open the door! Yes? My name is Christian, and I-- Yes? Let me in! Ah. The very words. I made it. I made it. For a moment, I thought I wouldn't, but I did. Ha! I did. No one gets turned away here. [OMINOUS MUSIC] What are you doing? Well, I was told this would come off once I got here. I believe the words were, "And there, you will be told what to do." Oh. Very well, then. I'd say you'd better run. Run? And by the looks of it, the sooner, the better. Come on. But I thought my journey was over. Over? Oh, no, dear boy. Your journey's just beginning. And if I were you, I'd-- [GROWLING] --make a dash for it now. But-- Go, quickly! But how will I know which way to go? The straight path. Always the straight. It will lead you to the Interpreter. Now, go. [INTENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC] [MAN SHOUTS] Come and get it, you winged rats! Slime bags! Take that! [CREATURES SCREECHING] [MAN GRUNTING] [POWERFUL DRAMATIC MUSIC] [SOFT MUSIC] Ow! I could sure use some help about now. [TWINKLING MUSIC] [LAUGH] What is this? [LAUGH] You want me to follow you? [LAUGH] [CHRISTIAN LAUGHING] [GRUNT] [LIGHT GENTLE MUSIC] [DOOR CREAKS OPEN] Who are you? My dear, dear boy. Why, I am the Interpreter. I've been expecting you. And I was expecting a house of some sort. Things are not always what they seem, dear Christian. And sometimes, life's tumbles can lead you to the most interesting of places. The Gatekeeper was right to say you would be helped here. Is there something the matter? The light, it seems to follow you. [LAUGHS] As it should. I am the Interpreter. I bring light where there are shadows. I see. Do you really, Christian? Do I really-- See and understand? Well, now I'm beginning not to. On your way here, you walked in darkness. I am here, Christian, to give light to the rest of your journey. [ETHEREAL MUSIC] Who are they? We are the followers of the King who leads us by way of the light in His book. The King's promises are ever at their side, and their gaze is to the things which last forever. Keep this in mind, Christian, for you will meet people who will pretend to lead you in the right and will only lead you into-- [BABY CRYING] --misery. And this? This is-- Passion, who throws a horrid tantrum because he wants things. No! No! No! [INTERPRETER TSKS] Won't you be a dear when you grow up? Patience, on the other hand, [LAUGH] is happy to enjoy things as they come. You are learning to look and not just see, Christian. Very good. And the interpretation here is that... I must be content to wait in patience for the things the King has promised me and not be tempted out of the way. The things you have seen will help you on your journey. And, lastly-- No! [SOMBER MUSIC] If you are wondering why he remains in the cage, ask him. Sir, why are you in such despair? No hope. I beg your pardon? Sir, I cannot hear you. No hope. No hope. No hope! No hope! No hope! No hope! No hope! No hope. That last one, it was very unpleasant. As despair can tend to be. But what did it mean? That is for you to interpret when the time comes. My gift to help you on your way may be summed up in these words. Look. Do not just see. Listen. And-- And do not just hear. You are ready to continue your journey. Ponder the things you have learned today, that they may prod your sides and lead you to that place your heart so longs for. [MUSIC - "BE THOU MY VISION"] (SINGING) Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart. Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art. Thou my best thought by day or by night. Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light. Patience Path. Passion Passage. Which one? Look. Do not just-- See. [SIGH] This doesn't make sense to me. But I have not gone wrong to follow the King's Road, no matter how difficult it may seem. (SINGING) Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise. Thou mine inheritance now and always. Thou and Thou only, first in my heart. High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art. If I am to go forward, the King shall give me strength. And if He wills to ease my load-- [LIGHT POWERFUL MUSIC] What? [WHOOSHING] Oh. Joy! What am I nearing that my burden is finally being loosed? [LAUGHS] Oh, I was right to follow the King's path, for with each step, He is setting me free! (SINGING) High King of heaven, my victory won. May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heaven's sun. Heart of my own heart, whatever befall, still be my vision, O Ruler of all. I'm free! I'm free! [GLASS SHATTERING] Do you understand what just happened, Christian? Who are you? We are the King's heralds. Do you understand what just happened? My heart, it has been cleansed. My King did for me what I and no one else could do. He has rid me of my burden. And He has given me new life. Indeed, He has. New garments for a new life. The King has made you one of His own. You walk as a prince before Him, Christian. My heart is overwhelmed with thanks, for my filthy rags and the heavy burden have been taken from me. And in their place, such blessing, such great blessing beyond compare. For now, continue on your journey until you reach the Palace Beautiful. There, you will be refreshed and readied for what lies ahead. [MASTER GROWLS] [SUPERVISOR GROANS] [HEAVY OMINOUS MUSIC] There was nothing we could do. We tried. But not well enough. We--we have failed you. [MASTER GROWLS] Perhaps--perhaps he will simply be forgotten. Perhaps we should just let him be. Let him be? Let him be?! The fool is a greater threat to us now than he was before. Threat? But how? He will not be forgotten. Others will try the same thing. No. He must be stopped. But, sire, he bears the seal. Do you think me that helpless? Have you not seen how many I have caused to turn away even this far into their journey? By the time I am through with this-- this Christian, he shall be lying in a pool of his own blood. [FOREBODING MUSIC] At last. [GROWLING] What was that? [GROWLING] What-- what is that? Just forest animals. [INTENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC] [GROWLING] What should I do? What should I do? I must go forward. Help. Help... Come. Come, good Christian. [CHRISTIAN SHOUTS] Come. Now, now, good Christian. You've shown great courage. You have passed a trial of your faith. Barely. But, well, my name is Watchful, and this is my home, and yours. My heart is still pounding. I fear I have almost lost my newfound joy. Well, you'd have to be dead not to feel some fear. Do not let that perturb you. Now you are here with me and my daughters, Discretion, Prudence, Piety, and sweet Charity. We welcome you to our family, good Christian. Thank you. Thank you for your hospitality. I've never seen anything like this. The King of the Celestial City built this house for the purpose of refreshing pilgrims such as yourself. It is now your house as well as ours. Others have taken the same path you now journey on. Let their example be an encouragement to you, for you are now part of their glorious company. You no longer walk alone. Now, please. Come to the table. [GENTLE MUSIC] And that's what set me on this path. But I must say that every step has taught me something new, and every hardship strengthened me. I have learned that the King wastes nothing. And, well, here I am, still in one piece. [LAUGHTER] And your family? [SIGH] Sister. I only ask because I see them in your heart. It is my one regret. I wish I had been better at convincing them. There is no need to hide your tears here, dear Christian. You are among family. I love my wife, and I love my children dearly. It does me good to speak of them since I carry them in my heart, holding on to the King's promise that they, too, may understand and follow or that I might have peace if they choose not to. Be assured. The King is aware of your sorrow. And not one tear shed for them is lost. Be at peace, good Christian, and lay your burdens at the feet of your King, for not one hair of your head falls without Him knowing. Now, come. There is a special place for you tonight to rest your weary head, your heart, and your soul. I think it suits him. Of course. He's fitted for a purpose. It's not as comfortable as my other clothes. But more in keeping with the next stage of your journey. Now, let's accompany him to-- Oh, no need to bother yourself-- oh! Oh, dear. Oh, my. I'm fine. I guess it's just as dangerous going down a hill than climbing up. [SHOUT] It is difficult for anyone to go down to the Valley of Humiliation. And when they do, they must walk alone. The what? It sounded like you said the Valley of-- [GASPS] [FOREBODING MUSIC] What is this? Where am I? So, a sword, a shield, armor. They were preparing me for battle. [HEAVY MUSIC] Courage. Courage! Why, Christian. What are you doing here in this horrid place so far away from your comfortable home and loving family? Who are you? You don't recognize me? [LAUGHS] Why, I am your prince. My prince? Now, really. A sword. As you can see, I am unarmed. Now, let's go back. Back? Christiana and the boys. You have no idea how much they miss you. Father, come home. Come home. If you'd only return. You miss them, don't you? I do. Father, where are you? Come home. Oh, Christian, why? But I am on this journey for the King, and I will not be dissuaded. So noble. Believe me, no one admires you more than I. But think about it. Even if you reach your destination, what will become of those you love? Perhaps you'll save yourself. But what of them? No. I think it's best you return with me. Now... [EERIE MUSIC] Put down your sword. [TENSE MUSIC] And their gaze is to the things which last forever. Keep this in mind, Christian, for you will meet people who will pretend to lead you in the right and will only lead you into-- Misery. What? The King has never failed me. And I will not fail Him, you deceiver, you liar, you usurper of all that is good-- Silence. --and true. I served under you and found nothing but misery. Silence! My allegiance is with the Celestial King. Is it? You heard me. How many times have you already failed Him on this journey? You are a disgrace to this King of yours. Which makes His mercy and forgiveness the sweeter. You are a deceiver that binds your subjects with invisible chains. The King has broken mine, and I am free. I follow Him. Then prepare to forfeit your journey, for I swear you will go no further. [TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC] [CHRISTIAN SHOUTS] [MASTER GROWLS] [GROWLING] [CHRISTIAN SHOUTS] [OMINOUS ETHEREAL MUSIC] You're mine! Do not gloat over me, you fiend. Though I have fallen, I will yet arise! [INTENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC] You will see me again, Christian, when the waves overpower you, when death's cold arms wrap themselves around your wretched soul, I will be there! [SCREAMS] Be gone! Be-- be gone. [SOFT MUSIC] [GASP] Faithful? And you are? And so you found the Book. By them, I learned about the coming war, the origins of our city. A cursed city, a city so opposite in nature to the one you and I journey to. One that will last-- Forever. Evangelist. [LAUGHTER] It's good to see you, Christian. This is the man who showed me the way. And a treasure he is to me as well, for I also am indebted to him. But tell us. What brings you this way? The joy of your company. Now, how about some food? Ha. A double blessing. Oh, and it could not have come at a better time. [EVANGELIST LAUGHS] Come then, friends, and rest awhile. I am glad not that you have had to face so many challenges, but that you faced them with such faith and continued in the way. A crown, dear Christian and Faithful, awaits you both, and it will last forever. But be advised, my friends, that you are not yet out of the reach of evil. And-- And? [SOMBER MUSIC] What more do you have to tell us? You-- You didn't just come here to sip tea. There's more, is there not? You cannot expect to continue without hardships. But we've already proven ourselves capable of that. And we have the dents to prove it. [CHRISTIAN LAUGHS] No. I mean severe, more difficult hardships, hardships from which you might not escape. Meaning? You will soon come to a town where you will be arrested. Arrested? And one or both of you will seal your testimony with blood. [OMINOUS MUSIC] The town you will go through is unique. Welcome to Vanity Fair. It was constructed by the evil Apollyon on the very path that leads to the Celestial City. A pie, I say. The town hosts a fair that never ends. [LIGHT PLAYFUL MUSIC] [CHATTER] And in it, you will encounter everything that tempts a human heart. Look, Fortunata. I've never laid eyes on these before. Through this town, you must go. Come now, strangers! Try our spirits! But be warned. Do not be overly confident, and heed to this warning. Settle it in your heart what you will do before you enter the town, for many have fallen who walked in with one eye on eternity and the other on the present. I would keep my eye on those two. --and, well, just about anything you like. Or the vests. Have you seen the vests? You can't be here without playing a game. No! [GASP] No? What we wish to obtain, you do not sell here. That, sir, is impossible. Did you hear what he said? What is going on here? What is the meaning of this disruption? These strange strangers insist that what they need is not available here. And as a result, they have disrupted our fair. Well, then, to the Judge. Out of my way. What? But we have done nothing. Excuse me. Make way. Make way. Yes. Make way, I say. [LIGHT PLAYFUL MUSIC] This is preposterous. Put the scoundrels away. What is the meaning of this? What is this interruption to our fair? What? These strange strangers. What did they do? Nothing. Nothing. Nothing? Exactly. They won't take part in anything. They won't buy anything. They are doing nothing. Well, by doing nothing, you have interrupted our fair. There's only one thing to do. Call the jury. Jury! [WHIRRING] [BELL DINGS] All present. Right. Do we have the witnesses? Envy and Gain Glory. Do you know these prisoners? Yes, at least 15 minutes. And what do you hold against them? They said that what they wanted we did not have. And what could that possibly be? Peace, joy, love, unselfishness, patience, contentment. And a crown that never fades away, among other things. Do we sell that? [ALL CHATTERING] Quiet in the court. Quiet in the court! Come, come. Do we sell any of these things? Of course not. This is Vanity Fair, not La La Land. I wouldn't even know where to get those kinds of things. Well, I have been informed that such things as you speak of cannot be sold, else you would find it aplenty in our fabulous fair. And that you say truthfully, for they can only be obtained by the King who gives them to all who desire them. Though they come not at the price of any coin, but of the surrender of the heart to His better ways. [COUGHS] You have proof that these wonderful things even exist? By the King's grace. Well, then, show them to us. They are not such things as you can hold in your hand. But are most excellent things which are held in the heart and are the most valuable during hardships, for it is then that their worth is most evident. Well, then, may I suggest just that, my lord, that we may see what we are so missing out on? Suggest what? Why, hardships, of course. Hardships? Hardships. Cruelty, approach the bench. What are you thinking? The fair has been disrupted. Is that not cause enough? I am ready for judgment. But not the townspeople. What are you talking about? Did you not see how they reacted to the comments of these two men? I say punish them harshly and openly that our people have evidence that these two fools possess nothing of this-- this peace, love, unselfishness, and blah-blah that they so boast about. And therefore, that our townspeople are not missing out on anything at all. Oh, I see. I do, indeed. Very well, then. I will postpone my judgment until evidence has been submitted. Commence the hardship, and resume the fair. What are you doing? Unhand me. Well, that's over. Let's get back to some fun. [LIGHT PLAYFUL MUSIC] And away we go. [LAUGHTER, CHATTER] So you got something better than us. Right in the head. [BOTH GRUNTING] This is better than the fair. Need more rocks. [LAUGHS] Look at them now. They what? Took every blow, every rock, every insult. And not once did they retaliate? They even tried to smile back at their attackers. No. How vile! How very unnatural of them. How purely evil. I say the sooner we get rid of them, the better. It's unanimous. Bring in the prisoners. [CROWD SHOUTING] The evidence was not to our satisfaction. Our behavior was in keeping with our-- Order! [HEAVY OMINOUS MUSIC] I sentence you to death. What? Starting with him. You can't. Well, I just did. No! All right, everyone. Back to the fair. Faithful. Faithful! Do not worry, my dear brother. This is what Evangelist came to prepare us for. Today, I seal my testimony with my blood. Faithful. No! Do not weep that I am sent ahead of you, dear brother. Stay true, and I shall yet see you. No! I shall yet see you! Don't worry. You'll have your turn tomorrow. Put him away. Faithful. Faithful! [HEAVY SOMBER MUSIC] [PEOPLE SHOUTING] Oh, Faithful. My dear brother, Faithful. Give me strength, and help me. Help me, please. Please. Drat. The fair is resuming, and here we are guarding this one who's as good as dead. You took the words right out of my mouth. And I've got an idea. You go along and enjoy the fair. I'll stay guard. No use both of us missing out. You come back later, and we'll switch. I don't know. Look. No one will know. You say nothing, and-- Say no more. Whoopee! I'll see you soon! [TENSE MUSIC] Huh? [FOREBODING MUSIC] [FOOTSTEPS] [TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC] Ah! No! Please! You're one of the guards from that city, and I am not going back. Neither am I. I'm not here to apprehend you. I'm here to go with you. When I heard what your companion-- Faithful. Yes, when I heard what Faithful had to say, it made sense to me. I'm not the only one in Vanity Fair that feels this way. There are others. Perhaps that's the reason the path leads through the city. So other sojourners can help people like you. You see that I've left everything. I cannot go back. And so you shall go with me. But I just realized, I do not yet know your name. Hopeful. Hopeful. Then, rest tonight, as your name implies, brave Hopeful. For tomorrow, we journey on to our King. [GENTLE MUSIC] My dear brother, Faithful, you did not die in vain. The path is a little rocky here. But look! What impedes us from walking that side of the path? But what if it leads us out of the way? How can it? It runs parallel. Look-- side by side as far as you can see. I am sure if we cut across there, we can then climb back over the wall and avoid that entire trek. Follow me. [HOPEFUL LAUGHS] [CHRISTIAN LAUGHS] [THUNDER RUMBLES] I can't even see the path anymore. We'll have to turn back the way we came. I never thought-- [THUNDER] Oh, no. [HEAVY MUSIC] I don't know, Hopeful. I really think we need to head back. But we can't even see which way to go now. Look. Let's shelter there for a while. We can wait it out here. It should be over soon. [THUNDER RUMBLES] [OMINOUS MUSIC] [BOTH SHOUT] And what do we have here? [TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC] (WHISPERING) You're never getting out of here. [VOICES WHISPERING] (WHISPERING) How many are your errors? How wrong you have been. How stupid. How long has it been? Six days. No food. No water. This is all my fault. We've discussed this so many times already. But it was my idea. And I agreed to it. You must really try and get that out of your mind. (WHISPERING) Just one slash. [VOICES WHISPERING] (WHISPERING) You're doomed. We're doomed, you and I. What? (WHISPERING) Doomed. Have you seen the bones down there? I honestly don't want to. We're dead. Let's just hope he doesn't come down again. Oh. No. (WHISPERING) Just die. [VOICES WHISPERING] I don't think I can take this much longer. What? Are you still alive? I gave you everything you needed to do the job-- knives, clubs, rope. What more could I do? Why didn't you do yourselves in? And now you've got me very up-- [GROANS] [SNORING] What happened? Did he just faint? Not again. Oh, dear. I should've listened to me mum when she warned me to marry you. Could've have me pick of any eligible giant being the beauty I was. But no. I had to pick the pretty one, I did. Now look at you, fainting like an old woman any time you get the slightest bit worked up. Why, I oughta-- [SCREAMS] [HOPEFUL AND CHRISTIAN SHOUT] [FEMALE GIANT GRUNTING] [INTENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC] All right. Why didn't she just kill us, just get it over with? (WHISPERING) How many are your errors? How stupid. Because she can't. What? Did you see her hands? She could crush us with her little finger. That's just it. She-- they can, but they can't. Why didn't I see it before? I really have no idea what you mean. Look, up there near the ceiling. What do you see? Skulls. A big skull, a bigger skull-- No, in the middle, the coat of arms. It's the name of this realm, this castle. Desperatio. The Castle of Despair. That's why they want us to kill ourselves. That's why we can't get out. Wait. I don't think I understand. What did the giant say? "I gave you everything to do the job." Don't you see? They can't kill. They can only make the situation so miserable that you do it yourself. There's always been a way of escape for you, hasn't there? That's got to be some way out. There's got to be. No hope. No hope! No hope! No hope! No hope. That was me. That was me in the cage. Now I'm the one in the dark. What is the opposite of despair? I don't know. Hope. [THRUMMING] What is that? [LIGHT TINKLING MUSIC] [GASPS] The way out. [POWERFUL DRAMATIC MUSIC] Shh. Quiet now. Just a little more, and-- [DOOR CREAKING] [BOTH LAUGH] We did it. Hopeful. [CREAKING] Hopeful! [TENSE MUSIC] [FOREBODING MUSIC] What was that? [GASP] Oh, you good-for-nothing. Be calm. Be calm. Don't get him worked up. Poochie-poo. Oh, whisker-pants. Huh? The prisoners, they're escaping. [TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC] [SHOUT] Quickly. You get them, cherry lips! Or I'll wring your neck. Get back here! [HOPEFUL AND CHRISTIAN SHOUT] That's good, dear. You're doing very well. Really, very well, you good-for-nothing oaf. Oh, dear. [GIANT PANTING] Quickly. Get them, you blithering fool! [PLODDING MUSIC] [GROAN] [HOPEFUL SCREAMS] This way. This way. I should've listened to me mum. I should. But no. Could've had me pick of any eligible giant. But no. I had to pick the pretty one, I did. Pretty stupid. Pretty smelly. Now I got to go down in me nightie to pick you up off the ground, you good-for-nothing. [SOFT MUSIC] Can you imagine the trouble that giant will face from his irate wife? He'll despair, that's for certain. [BOTH LAUGH] What happened? I have no idea. The path seems to have vanished. And yet you will still be guided. Welcome to the King's Delightful Mountains, a taste of things to come. [SHEEP BLEATS] Thank you, kind Shepherd. My name is-- Christian. And you are Hopeful. You are known and loved. Tell me. Do we know you? In part. You will be delighted to hear that you are within sight of that city which you have so diligently sought and for which you have also suffered. That is, indeed, good news. And the rest of the way, is it very dangerous? Let this knowledge suffice for now-- that you do not walk alone, for the King guides you as a shepherd does his sheep. He always goes before, even if out of sight of the sheep. I give you a map for the rest of your journey. Beware the Flatterer. Do not sleep on the enchanted ground. Keep the light of the city ever before you. We shall do as you say, kind Shepherd. Now, if you please, is this the way that leads-- where did He go? He spoke about a map. Did you give it to you? I was going to ask you the same thing. Alas, it could have come in handy just about now. I don't know what direction to take. Well, isn't this a sight? I daresay it's not every day that one finds other pilgrims this far along. I-- well, I'm just beside myself with joy to meet you. I'm Christian, and this is my good friend, Hopeful. Such names. They can only reflect your goodly character, I'm sure. You're going to the Celestial City, I suppose? Indeed, we are. Then we shall walk together. But the light of the city seems to be coming from over there. Or so it seems. Come, come now. I know exactly what I am doing. I am a great judge of character, you know. I only accept the company of those with the same dedicated inclinations as I. Well, we have tried to be faithful, though we have had our stumblings. Christian, however, exceeds me in both virtue and courage, having begun his journey much earlier than I. I admire him completely. And upon hearing that, so do I. Oh, come now. I'm hardly a model of virtue. Tut, tut. You are too modest. Share with me even a snippet of one of your brave adventures, and I shall be forever in your debt. Well, I don't know. There are so many. Ah, such humility. He survived the Swamp of Despondency. That despicable mire. And the Valley of Humiliation. In which so many have gone mad. We escaped the Castle of Despair. Which so few seem to have done, judging by the bones scattered there, I might add. I should fall at your feet. Oh, and I fought Apollyon, you know. [GASPS] Well, aren't you the greatest-- [HOPEFUL AND CHRISTIAN SHOUT] [MAN LAUGHS] The greatest fool, I should say! You. Surprised? Do you think we give up that easily? Get us out of here. See these strands? They were woven by your own boasting. And judging by them, I fear your own pride has kept you from your destination. Let us go. [TSKS] A pity you will not be able to get word to your wife or, shall I say, widow. [LAUGHS] [HEAVY MUSIC] No! A Flatterer. What? He was a Flatterer. We stepped right into his trap. When am I ever going to learn? Let's not despair again, Christian. But now I won't be able-- Stop, please. Let's not give up hope. We've got to think back on what the Shepherd said. "Beware of the Flatterer." Before that. "You do not walk alone." [SOFT ETHEREAL MUSIC] And you are not alone now. [BOTH GRUNT] That was painful. Sometimes, Hopeful, a rescue means wounds. Did you not meet the Shepherd of the Delightful Mountains? We did. And did He not give you a map? He only counseled-- And warned us. But the map, He didn't give us. The King's instructions are a map, Christian. Did they not indicate where to go and where not to go? They did. I can see that now. Be vigilant to your last breath, for you are very near your journey's end. How will we know when we are there? When you stand at the brink of the last shadow, the border beyond which evil has no power, where the old is left forever and newness of life begins. Do not fear to cross, for your eternal city lies beyond. You will find your step deeper or shallower as you believe in the superiority of the King. Where are you going? Can you not see the city beyond? I'm looking for the crossing. Christian. Christian. I don't understand. There doesn't seem to be any way to get across. No way around it. No way over it. Only through it. What are you talking about? There's no way-- Can't you see what this is? This is the last shadow, the borders beyond which evil has no power-- Death. Death? Where the old is left forever and newness of life begins. We can go forward. But we can never go back. [SOFT HEAVY MUSIC] I'm going. Hopeful? I am going, Christian. And I-- I'm not. You have to. You've come this far. To make a way for others, Hopeful. To make a way from my wife, my family-- to save them. And that, you cannot do, for the way has already been paved for others by the same one that paved it for you. Your part has been to follow. And, believe me, it has caused no lack of talk among the people of your former city. Others will follow. Including my wife and children? That question, dear Christian, can only be answered by them. But if they do, would you lead them to this point only or to a new and everlasting life in which evil has no part? I'm going. I must. Hopeful. All through our journey, you told me that the King's ways never failed you, that His promises were true. I know He will not fail me now. Goodbye, dear brother. Hopeful! He's gone. To the Celestial City, to all that has been promised, to what you both sought so diligently. Well? I'm afraid. And there is nothing wrong with that. You have trusted the King with your life, Christian. And I, dear friend, I shall trust him with my-- [POWERFUL DRAMATIC MUSIC] You will see me again, Christian, when the waves overpower you, when death's cold arms wrap themselves around your wretched soul. I will be there. No! You will find your step deeper or shallower as you believe in the superiority of the King. Help! [HEAVY DRAMATIC MUSIC] [GROWL] [SCREAM] I'm bleeding. [ETHEREAL MUSIC] [FOOTSTEPS] [GASP] You. [GENTLE MUSIC] You're the Shepherd. I am. I am the Good Shepherd. I saw the blood. I was bleeding. It was not your blood, Christian, but mine. And you needn't worry any longer about wounds, for you have arrived to the place where the old is passed away and newness of life begins. Welcome, Christian. Welcome to the Celestial City. [BRIGHT POWERFUL MUSIC] Haha! Welcome, brother! Christian! Welcome! Christian, my dear brother. Hopeful? Faithful! [LAUGHS] My friends! My brothers. Oh, that my dear ones could see this, that they, too, would come... that they, too, would come! [LIGHT MUSIC] [MUSIC - "BLESSED ASSURANCE"] (SINGING) This is my story. This is my song. Praising my Savior all the day long. This is my story. This is my song. Praising my Savior all the day long. [GENTLE MUSIC] I know this will break your heart, as it does mine. But I am going because I have no doubt the Book speaks truth. I have taken a promise from its pages, which I will carry near my heart. "Eye has not seen. Ear has not heard. Neither can anyone imagine the wonderful things the King has prepared for those that seek Him." Christian is alive! [POWERFUL MUSIC] Boys? Boys, wake up. Your father's alive. Your father is alive! [CREATURE SCREECHES]
