What sparked the origin of a human from an ape was… The fire in him. Man has fulfilled the need for food by lighting a fire. Also spreading light by converting it into a lamp. From time to time, he adds fuel to the flames of desire within him… Thereby kindling a blazing fire. This flame that burns with emotions like lust, anger, greed, pride and envy… It turned him into ashes. A gleaming beam of light has become this blazing flame of fury. This fire doesn’t mark the beginning of this film. In fact, it calls for the end. And the reason behind it is… "Desire is the root of misery" "Desire is the root of misery" "Desire only leads to greed" "And avarice follows greed" When desire intensifies, it’s greed. And when greed intensifies, it’s avarice. Desire is the foundation of misery. This desire that’s the root of all misery… lies in the deepest layers of our heart. When you have a baby… You desire to distribute sweets. And when it’s a baby girl… You desire to find her a suitor. In case it’s a baby boy… You desire to find him a beautiful woman. After marriage, you desire for them to have kids. And if it’s a baby girl, you desire it should’ve been a baby boy. Hey! Sit properly. Desires keep popping in our heads all the time. Is it possible to survive without desires? Is it? You tell me. Is it possible? No. Exactly! Not possible! No creature on Earth can do that. Because… The God who created us also created desire. Hey! He’s so engaging and you’re falling asleep? He’s doing it ‘cause he’s getting paid for it. Ask him to do it for free. I bet he wouldn’t talk shit. Shut up! It’s not like we’re paying him. He manipulates the well-off for money. And people like us for attention. Such a despo! Yeww! Stop it! Don’t just blurt disgusting things. I was born with disgust. Can’t help it. Shut up and listen. We all decide to shut up and move on. But, the heart wants what it wants, right? Lust sees no divide. Desires see no threat. Lust is the origin of birth. Desire is the origin of lust. Desires are as common as lust. But, ‘cause we’re living in a civilized society… We should have control over lust and desire. Otherwise, how are we any different from animals? Common, huh? We should have control, is it? I dare him to look into my eyes for 2 minutes. Let’s see if he’s got his lust under control. Or if he’s got his tool up. Shut up! Don’t say whatever comes to your mind and embarrass me. Let’s go home. Venkayamma… we’re heading back. Okay. Let’s go. Hmm. Where did you find that? It was staring at me from the tree. Pleading to come closer. So I went ahead and plucked it. I wish I got everything I wanted this easily. You know, I don’t get you. Your dad would be waiting for us. Your alcoholic husband would be waiting for you. Not me. If I were lucky enough to find someone who cared… I would’ve had 3-4 kids by now, like the rest of my friends. Malli, it should be in your destiny. Your time should come. If you stand and stare, house is not coming any closer. We should only walk to it. Same goes for time as well. Instead of being hopeless about it… We should change our own destiny. What are you looking at? You wouldn’t get my pain. What kind of a mother are you? You’ve been my age once. How could you still not get my pain? Let’s go. We have 3 more miles to cover. Walk and think. Come on. Malli, I hear some vehicle rattling outside. Go take a look. My life is depressing anyway. Now I can’t even get a good night’s sleep? Just go! We're here. Endure for some time. I can't walk, mom. Mom, it’s Mr. Raju’s vehicle. Oh! Mr. Raju’s daughter Sarasu is carrying. Maybe she went into labor. I’ll go and heat up some water. You go and get a knife for cutting the umbilical cord. Go! -Bear it a little longer. Subbaiah, wake up! Subbaiah! Go take a look. Go away! Come in, dear. Be strong. Sarasu, we’re almost done. Just for a little longer. Calm down, Sarasu. We’ll be done. I can’t do it. Stop screaming so much! I won’t drink from tomorrow. Sarasu! Push a little harder. Malli, hold her hand. Sarasu, it’s almost over. It feels like I’m dying! Oh, god! You could die if I drink again tomorrow. Sleep for now. Malli, tell your dad to shut up for some time. If he just listened, he wouldn’t be my dad. Mind your business. Just a little longer. It’s almost over, dear. What the hell! Why are you crying like a baby? Go to sleep. You’ve been a blessing. It all went smoothly because of you. I’m just like a Messenger. My job is only to deliver the almighty’s Creation to you. Baby looks so cute! Goes after his mother. If the son looks like his mother… He is said to be lucky. “Go to sleep, my love” “Go to sleep” “Go to sleep, my dear” “Go to sleep” “I’ve given birth with love” “I lay here with hope for your life” “As the wind sways towards our tale” “I just hope for a better future for you” “Go to sleep, my love” “Go to sleep” “Go to sleep, my dear” “Go to sleep” “This poisonous world tries to spill venom” “I hope you reign and conquer your life” “The world is at your feet” “Be one in a million” “Mother’s love is always with you” “Go to sleep, my love” “Go to sleep” “Go to sleep, my dear” “Go to sleep” “I’ve given birth with love” “I lay here with hope for your life” “Go to sleep, my love” “Go to sleep” “Go to sleep, my dear” “Go to sleep” Who’s there? Who is it? They left their footwear back here. I don’t think they’re anywhere nearby. Is anybody out there? Sir! Oh, no! Did they lose hope on life and jump into the water? Help! Somebody jumped into the water. Help! Somebody help! Oh, no! Sir…! Somebody jumped into the water. Help! Hey! Hey! Why are you yelling? Oh, you’re alive! Thank god! I’ve been asking you to get out. I thought maybe you were dead. How can I respond from underwater? Oh, yes. For me, there’s not much difference. Anyway… Why did you leave all your stuff out here and go underwater? I was doing a procedure where you hold your breath underwater. I was practicing. Even Duryodhana from Mahabharata used to perform yoga underwater. You seem to be his disciple. Nice! You know a lot of stuff. God didn’t give me eyesight. But he gave the art to learn. By the way, you sound new here. Where are you from? I’m not from anywhere. Yet, I belong everywhere. I travel from place to place to enjoy Nature. You could call me a wanderer. How do you afford your means then? I’ve earned more than I’d need. Thought it was high time that I started travelling. Oh. I hope your journey is a smooth one. Your name? Srinu. Srinivas. And you? Kannappa. I get it. You’re wondering if my parents gave me that name or I did? It’s the name I gave myself. Lord Shiva gave Kannappa’s eyes back to him when he offered them. So, I named myself after him in the hope that Lord Shiva will give me eyesight. Your hope will be answered. I see you’re holding flutes. Is there a good artist in Kannappa? Most definitely. The flutes on my shoulder are for making a living. The flute in my hand is for practice. Well said! Play a nice song for me. Let me see. Will you see or listen? I’ll listen while I see. Just play. Alright. [gibberish chanting] 'Goddess of Wealth is bestowing you with grace.' Hear me out, sir. Tell me if it’s true or false. There’s no way it’d be a lie. No lie would come out from this mouth. I am the manifestation of Lord Shiva. I was born with a purpose. We don’t have the time to get to know you. Or the patience to fulfill your wishes. Move on. Find someone else. Don’t say you’ve got nothing. I can see that the Goddess of Wealth is in your favor. Stop it, man! What do you see? Goddess of Wealth, huh? Yes. Come inside. Come on. Hey! Search the entire house. If you find a single penny… I’ll give you 5 pennies. If you don’t, just give me 2 pennies. What say? Goddess of Wealth, my foot! Don’t say that, sir. I’m definite when I say that Goddess of Wealth is in your favor. But if you’re not quick to act, she will leave before you know. But it’s quite late in the day. Curses can’t kill us. We’ve been dead for 15 years now. Goddess would never curse you two. In fact, she’s going to grant you a boon. I’m just here to tell you not to turn it into a curse. She’s going to grant us a boon, huh? Yes. Is she going to fill our house with gold? Yes. There’s going to be a shower of gold in your house. It’s your responsibility to protect that treasure. We don’t have a locker to keep it safe. We would need to dig a pit. How deep do you think it should be? Depends on what goes into the pit, sir. Watch out and dig. Come on! I’ve had enough of you two. Didn’t I ask you to leave? Dear… Hey! Who are you? Shut up and leave when you’re asked to. If you cross your limits, I’ll feed your tongue to my dog. It’s Wednesday. Meat day for my dog. Don’t do that, dear. My tongue is my bread and butter. You know… Hey! Shut up and get out of here. You could gloat all you want. But eventually, we all end up in the soil. True. In the soil. But, it’s not ordinary soil. In fact, it’s sacred. You could make a playing doll with it or an idol to worship. It’s in your hands. The dirt you’re going to get your hands on… It will improve the quality of your lives. You’re not just cursing anymore. Now you’re trying to terrify us. Get out of here! If you make me furious… I’m going to burn you under a mountain of cotton. Cursing us, is it? Excuse me. Hey! I said get lost! Who are you? What do you want? Can I get some water? Come in. Thanks, amma. Are you coming from the city? Yes, amma. You look educated. What brings you here? My name is Srinivas. I travel across several villages and write articles on my experiences. I also draw cartoons. What are cartoons? Cartoons are comical pictures. Oh! Those extremely animated pictures in the newspaper. Oops. I totally forgot. I went to the temple here. They gave the holy offering. Please have it. Priest gave you the holy offering. You should keep it. Holy offering is meant to be shared. We’re destined to be in this moment. Please have it. Amma, please don’t mind. I’m feeling rather weak. It will be night by the time I reach the next village. Can I spend the night here? Whoa! Don’t you think you’re taking advantage? You’re too fast. Please don’t get me the wrong way. Listen, dear. We’re a poor family. If you walk through the night, you’ll reach the next village. You’ll have all kinds of facilities there. You won’t be able to stay here. I travel across villages hoping for some food, water and shade. Even a rich house has a roof. But my roof is beyond all roofs. And that’s the sky. I’ll not cause any trouble. Just feed me some of what you eat. I’ll sleep out here. All I’m asking for. I get it, amma. You have a young lady in the family. So you’re scared to let a stranger into the house. Am I right? What did you say? We’re scared? There’s not a single house until a couple of miles. Even if somebody yells, not a soul will hear. Do you know what I’m known for around here? This isolated house. We don’t fear ghosts. Humans can do us no harm. We’re not scared or anything. Just hesitant ‘cause you’re a stranger. Am I right, Malli? Due to God’s grace, we can afford to feed another soul. We’ll just cook some extra rice for you. Am I right, Malli? Come on, guys! Not fair! Don’t you two put this on me. Do you want him to stay or leave? It’s totally up to you. Alright. Come inside, dear. It’s okay, amma. I’ll sleep out here. It’s okay. Come in. You can see the sky from inside our house as well. [singing randomly] Oh, no! Why are you doing this work? ‘Cause this is the only way I’ll get to drink in the evening. You want to join me? No! No! I don’t drink. I didn’t mean alcohol. Do you want to have coffee or tea? Oh, that would be nice. Dear… Yeah? He wants a cup of tea. He just said he’ll eat whatever we give him. Now he’s making demands. What’s with him? It’s not his demand. It’s your dad’s. Dear, we’ve got milk. But there’s no tea powder. We’re poor. We drink jaggery tea only. We can’t afford sugar. Come on! He is tired and wants some tea. You didn’t have to talk to him like that. Give me money and I’ll go get tea powder. Make tea for him. I know who wants tea here. You’ve got money, right? Buy your own tea powder. I’ll make tea for you. No way! I don’t want your tea then. Oh, no! It’s okay. I have money. Here you go. No. You’re our guest. We can’t take your money. It’s okay. Come on. Shall I tag along? No. My cycle can’t pull the weight of two. I’ll be right back. Alright. Dad! Get me orange candy with the change. What are you looking at me for? Don’t you want me to milk the cow for your tea? Your name is Malli, right? It’s Mallika. Mom and dad call me Malli. Oh. Then what should I call you? Huh? Malli or Mallika? Call me whatever you like. But first, let me milk this cow in peace. Alright, Mallka. What’s this? What’s what? This. Oh, that. It’s like a dumbbell. Who works out here? My dad used to. You know, to be good in bed. What?! He used to do it for strength. You’re from the city, right? You wouldn’t get it. Forget it. Hey, dear! What? I bought tea powder. Hey! Orange candy. Give it to Malli. Hmm. Tea. It’s yummy. Thanks. Thanks to you too. Why? Dad bought me orange candy with the change. I also love orange candy. Want me to get it? Uh-huh. No. If I eat anything sweet now, I can’t enjoy the tea. Not bad. Looks like the city lad works out. People who work out shouldn’t drink tea and stuff. Then? You should drink milk. Let me know if you want. I’ll milk it for you. I’ll milk it for you! I knew it! I knew it was all cock and bull stories. Somebody’s yelling. It’s some crazy guy. Doesn’t sound crazy. Not everyone can see how crazy some people are. Finish the tea. It’s cooling down. Malli! Hey, Malli! Veeranna is here. You stay here, son. Where did she go? Hey! Do you have any sense at all? I asked you to water the crop last night. What were you up to, huh? It was a no-moon day last night. Pandit asked me not to step out of the house. You get all superstitious when you have to water my crop. But when you need money, there’s no such superstition. You’re not at loss here. I have to bear the damages if the crop dries out. Money is more important to me than time. You know me. I’ll tolerate this only as long as I do. If you keep this up, I’ll rip your skin off. Mind your tongue, Veeranna! Don’t go on and on about your crop. We mortgaged it to you ‘cause of the debt. We’re not your gardeners to take all your crap. Don’t just blurt whatever comes to your mind. Sister, what did I say now? I swear on my curly mane, I said… ‘You can’t be like ignorant. You have a daughter to take care of.’ Stop it! That’s enough advice for a day. Take a look in the mirror. Everybody knows the kind of person you are. We don’t need a moral lecture from you. It’s not like that, sister. I know how much you’re struggling ‘cause of his mistakes and debts. That bothers me. There’s a way to end your struggle. Only if you change your mind about… But he’s not ready to do that! Stupid! Stupid dog! Just drink your milk. Why are you licking my hand? Look at your face. You’re a dog. Better act like one. Just ‘cause you have the liberty, don’t act all mushy. I’ll chop it off. Your tongue! Mr. Veeranna… Huh? I’ll make sure dad goes to work from tomorrow. You can go now. It’s rather humid these days. I wouldn’t suggest you to step outside. Go home, have buttermilk and take a nap. The heat in your body will subside. Hey, dog! Drink it. Dad! Hmm? You’ve been pounding that thing for hours now. Like you’re the only one working here. You can’t live without making mistakes. Or get a work done without any noise. I’m very well aware of all the things you do in silence. Hey! I loved your tea, amma. It was filled with love and affection. Mm-hmm. You could sense all of that in a cup of tea? I’ve never had the fortune of my mother’s love. Even a small greeting feels like a shower of love. Excuse me... I could see that the man who came earlier really bothered you. Who is he? Loan shark. Hold this. A farmer’s life is really tough. I own this house and the 9 acres surrounding it. We were really well off at one point of time. So much so that maybe even God got jealous. He started troubling us. First, he damaged our crop. Then, he went for our health. So much money went into hospital expenses and medicines. We were helpless. I had to take a loan. We slow down for a second. And the debt keeps piling up. Interest kept on increasing. We couldn’t afford to pay it anymore. We had to mortgage the house and land to the loan shark. Our misfortune took a toll on us. We had to put our self-respect aside and take the insults. This is a sad way to live. We can’t just die either. Consider it passing with the stream. Forget it. Now we’re the labor in our own land. Our family was one to aspire for. Now we’re a token for misfortune. When will our problems go away? Soon, amma. All your problems will go away. When? After I become old? Amma, how much money do you need to pay your debt? Let’s not talk about that now. It’s okay. Tell me. 25,000 rupees debt. 35,000 rupees interest. We told you that we’re in trouble. But we didn’t ask for your donation. It’s not like that, Mallika. I’m an orphan. I’ve worked hard and earned this all by myself since I was a kid. There’s three of you. You guys are strong. Good-hearted. Money is not permanent. I have it today. Tomorrow, it will be yours. Man can make anything possible. What matter is trust and hard work. You took me in, though I’m a stranger. Good happens to the good-hearted. I’m not saying I’ll give you all this money. If I could earn so much alone… Imagine what the three of you could do. If you think I’m being unreasonable, forgive me. That’s not necessary, dear. We can see that it’s hard earned money. Oh, no! It’s bad omen. Malli, go take a bath. Hmm. Dear, keep all this inside and take a bath. Why? You should take a bath when a lizard falls on you. It’s a superstition. Go! Alright. Hey, Malli! I asked you to bathe for the sake of it. What’s taking you so long? Almost done, mom. Coming. Me and your dad are going to the field. Okay. Come back fast. Ask dad to stick to work. Shut up! You’re becoming a loose tongue day by day. Keep an eye on the house. Be careful! Got it. You don’t have to stress so much! You know me! I do! But it’s my responsibility to tell you. See you. Hmm! If I had known about the lizard… I would’ve heated some water for you. I don’t think you’re used to cold showers. Of course, I am. I don’t get hot water every place I go to. Be it a river, lake or well… I dive into whatever I can find. You believe in all this stuff? You know… bad omen, etc. You shouldn’t look for logic in ancient sciences. Everything our ancestors said had a reason to it. I believe in that. On top of that, amma insisted. So I had to oblige. You look tough on the outside. But you’re good at heart. You too. You sound harsh. But the get the image of Goddess Lakshmi when I see you. Stop lying! Goddess Lakshmi is decked in gold. She doesn’t have a bare neck like me. If gold is all that’s missing… I have gold with me. Let’s adorn you in that. No way! I want to try it on once though. Shall I? What’s wrong? Stepped on a thorn. It hurts. Where? What do you think you’re doing? Aren’t you ashamed to do that in front of a guy? What did I do? Are you seriously asking me that? I’ve been watching you ever since I came. Your glances are deceiving. You look at me with the wrong intentions. When a young lady acts like this… That makes me a whore, huh? So you’re calling me a whore now. Am I right? My leg was hurt. So I pulled my clothes up to take a look. That was it. I wasn’t trying to flash my thighs and seduce you. I wanted to try on the jewelry, right? So you think my character is loose. It’s true that I’m not married yet. But I never once thought of throwing myself at someone. So I never did. Mallika… Hmm? I’m sorry if I was hurtful. It’s okay. That made it pretty evident that you’re a good man. You can’t obviously be with someone you don’t like. Forget it. What did you say? Nothing. Your parents aren’t back yet? Any minute now. Hey! Playing snake and ladder after sunset brings misfortune. Keep it away. Is that going to make us lucky? You’ll never change! Enough! Mind your business. Dear… Amma… I’m making steamed rice balls for dinner. You’ll eat, right? Yes, amma. Don’t worry. It tastes good. I know, amma. Alright then. Amma… Yes? I initially said that I’d eat whatever you give me. Please don’t mind that I’m asking differently now. I wish to eat your chicken curry. Can you make it for me? What did you say? Chicken curry? You can’t just wish for chicken curry and have it served. This is not a hotel , dear. It’s our house. Not possible. Oh, no! Don’t let the idea baffle you. Tell me what the expenses are. I’ll pay. How much will it cost? Around 20 rupees. No big deal. Take 200 rupees. 200 rupees?! Buy what all you need for the curry. With the rest, buy what you love. Hey! Return his money. Right now! Why are you insulting us by giving us money? Oh, no. That was not my intention. I feel like eating chicken. That is why I gave the money. It’s alright. He wants to eat chicken. Make it for him. She’ll make it. Don’t worry. Tell me what all you need. When have you ever listened to me? Well, we’ve got garlic and ginger. Get masala spices and onions. Hmm. Okay. You chop the chicken and marinate it. I’ll be right back. Malli, come here. Hmm. Excuse me... Listen! Yes? You want a bottle? No. My stomach is upset. I don’t know where the washroom is. Can you show me? There’s a small lake in the back. Do it there. Be careful. There might be bugs. Take a lantern with you. Alright. Go. Go. Quick. I asked for 20 bucks and he gave 200. He might’ve given 1000 bucks if I asked for 200. Of course! He has loads of cash and jewelry in his suitcase. Goddess of Wealth is going to present you a boon. There’s going to be showers of wealth in your house. It is your responsibility to safeguard that treasure. The dirt you’re going to get your hands on… It will improve the quality of your lives. Why do you look lost, dear? Are you angry that I yelled at you earlier? I don’t take such petty things to heart. Yeah, right. You put on a good act. Done grinding the spices? Hey! Don’t make it too smooth. Mom, have you ever given 200 rupees when they only need 20? I’m not crazy to do that. I know, right? Then why did he give 200 bucks? I have a feeling it’s not his hard earned money. But he said that it was. If it was his money, he wouldn’t spill it like that. That money belongs to somebody else. He’s just having fun with it. It’s not his hard earned money. He stole it. Hey! He’ll hear you. He’s not home. He went out. Why do we care how he got his money? If we don’t care, our lives will never get better. What? What if his money and gold became ours? How is that possible? If he’s alive, it belongs to him. What if he’s not? He said we’re destined to share the holy offering. I say we’re destined to take his wealth. You chop the chicken for the curry. And the guy who eats the curry… You’re acting insane. You’re right. I’m tripping on desire. You don’t have the right to talk. You enjoyed your youth. Nobody cares about my pain. None of you have any idea what I desire. I can’t be any honest than this. It will make the both of us uncomfortable. There’s only one solution to all our problems. And that’s… killing him! Hey! No! If you still can’t get it into your head… I can’t help it. Veeranna has a thing for me. To repay the debt you guys took… I’ll go sleep with him. So, you’re saying we kill him? You heard that fortune teller this morning. Goddess of Wealth is going to present you a boon. The dirt you’re going to get your hands on… It will improve the quality of your lives. That’s not it. A lizard fell on my left shoulder and his right palm. You always said that… When a lizard falls on your left shoulder, you’ll get wealth. And on the right palm, it’s death. He’s fated to die in our hands. And that’s his destiny. Malli… I’m… I’m somehow scared. Hey… Dear… I bought 100 grams of coriander powder. You know what she’s saying? A bunch of coriander and curry leaves. Are you even listening to me? I also bought cloves, cinnamon and poppy seeds. She wants to kill him. Let’s kill him. It’s not so easy to do it. It’s like an opportunity came knocking. Why miss it? Even I want be done with Veeranna. Sweetheart, as a father, I never fulfilled any of your wishes. If this will do you good, I will go to any lengths. As women, you do what you have to. As a man, I’ll do my part. Feed him chicken curry, you also eat some and go to sleep. By dawn… Excuse me! Looks like you’re absorbed in the conversation. You didn’t forget about my curry, did you? I was just telling her how much the spices cost. And the change… I asked you to keep it for later. You were going to get something for yourself, right? Didn’t you? I’ll go now. Go fast. Chicken curry will be waiting for you. You guys do your thing. I’ll be right back. Amma… What is your opinion on killing? I mean, we’re killing this hen for chicken now. I want to know your thoughts on that. You only asked us to kill it. Of course. But I feel it’s wrong to kill another creature to feed ourselves. Aren’t you going to eat the curry now? Of course, not. Just trying to make conversation. Wouldn’t starve myself. This has to die if you want to eat curry. You’re right. But I wish we could relish that taste without having to kill the hen. If one thing has to survive… Something else has to die. That’s the Law of Nature. The bigger creatures feed on the smaller ones. Man is also a creature. Man doesn’t feed on man. Those times aren’t here yet. That is why we’re feeding on chicken or mutton. If it makes you so uncomfortable, don’t eat it. No. No. I wouldn’t make that mistake. Just thought I’d say a prayer in that poor hen’s name. Will you keep talking? Or will you let us cook? Curry is important. You carry on. Subbaiah… Huh? Me and my dad had a small bet. You should tell us who will win. Dad bet that you will not drink from tomorrow. I bet that you will. Who’s going to win that bet? Me or my dad? Are you father-son trying to mock me? No, listen. A guy in pain has a reason to drink. Why would a happy guy do, tell me? I say a drunkard needs no reason to drink. Stop it, you two! You can choose not to sell liquor to me. But you have no right to stop me. Oh! Now I get the twist. You want to confuse me… So much so that I don’t feel the kick anymore… Eventually making me drink more. It’s not going to work out. I have to do something important tonight. Really important. In order to do that, I need to drink less. I won’t drink. Raju, get me another bottle. Annapurnamma… O’ Annapurnamma… We have to harvest the crop in Mr. Naidu’s field tomorrow. I’ll get you a good wage. Will you and your daughter tag along? Yeah, sure. At what time? Venkayamma, we won’t come to work from tomorrow. Oh, is it? But I’ve promised to bring you both. What do I do now? Find somebody else. We’re not available. I get it. See you later. Amma, I won’t be here tomorrow. Maybe you’re cancelling work assuming so. You will not be here. There will be no need to work either. That is why we’re not going. Err… We’ve got work in our own field. That is why we refused to go. Oh. That’s alright then. I just don’t want to bother you. Then you should definitely die. Amma... How long until the chicken is ready? Just a little longer. It’s almost cooked. I’m damn hungry. Then you’re going to die hungry. He’ll be here. I don’t think so. Your husband is not coming home tonight. He’s got money in his pockets now. He must’ve gotten drunk and puked till he dropped. What do you want to do now? Malli…!!! Oh, it was a dream! What did I tell them? Just cook and serve. They wouldn’t dare to go beyond. No chance! Raju! Amma, looks like it will be dawn before the chicken’s ready. If you boil it too much, it might just come back to life. Be careful. I’m straining the rice. Will serve the dish in some time. Sure, amma. You seem to be growing soft for him. What do I do? You said we’d just have to feed him. And your dad will take care of the rest. You mean my drunkard of a dad? You seriously think he’ll show up? He’s not coming home until he spends every penny he has. We can’t depend on him. What do you want to do then? If he’s really destined to die in our hands… Nobody can stop it. Whatever it is, we’d only have to do it. No, Malli. Don’t say that, mom. We can’t solve our problems without getting blood on our hands. I’m not saying you shouldn’t do it. I’m saying, don’t get blood on your hands. You mean? Poisonous herb. "Want to hear a tale of atrocity?"

Err… I was sketching earlier. Must be the ink. I’ll go wash and come. Are you out of your mind? Have you lost it completely? It’s pretty dark. Watch your step, sir. I don’t need your advice. Let’s go. Mom, cops are here. Listen! Amma… Stay where you are. Don’t come out till I tell you so. What happened? We have guests over. You can’t be seen here at this time. You know how corrupted people’s minds are. Try to understand. It’s okay. I get it. I’ll stay put till you call me. Okay. I don't think I'll get to eat chicken today. What brings you here, sir? A thief snuck into Mr. Naidupeta Shetty’s house. We got information that he’s hiding in this area. We’re looking for him. Have you come across any new face in this area? Annapurnamma, it smells delish. Is it meat? Sir... I made chicken curry. That’s amazing. Aren’t you going to let me taste some? Can I also…? Why are you barking? It doesn’t bite. Who knows? It might. They says a dog that barks doesn’t bite. My sir does both, you know that? Let’s go. Come on. Let’s eat some chicken. "Trust has been broken" "Manipulation has dominated" "Fake smiles mask the evil intentions within" Oh! It’s already served. Perfect! Oh, no. Don’t eat that. I’ll get you a new plate. Why? I’m not an outsider. I don’t mind. Wow! Chicken is piping hot. Let me eat in this. Get him a different plate. This is defiled. It’s not good manners to feed defiled food to the guest. I’ll go get a new plate. Malli, get two plates. Get some curry as well. Annapurnamma, why are you rushing? Hand slipped, sir. Malli, clean this up. I’ll get the curry.

But you’re a wonderful cook. Hey! Ramu, no! Go away! Let it eat. It’s on the floor anyway. It was delicious. You fed us as soon as we asked. God bless you! Sir, I’m feeling drowsy already. Shall we take a small nap and go? Shut up and come. What is this? It was barking till now. Now it’s already asleep. That’s how it is. Sleeps immediately after eating. Bloody dog! Heard that? If we sleep here, that’s what she’ll call us. Let’s go.

Amma… What is this? I wanted to get your blessings in the afternoon itself. So you didn’t add the poison. You don’t care about your daughter’s life. You just want to keep some stranger alive. So you don’t really care even if I have to sleep with someone to repay the debt. Malli... Why do you say stuff like that and make me cry? When I saw the dog die, I got scared. I couldn’t get myself to kill this man. Of course. Why would you do anything for me? I should drink the poison for being born as your daughter. Hey! Don’t worry. I won’t kill myself. No matter what, I will do what I want to. Hey, Raju! Get me another bottle. Enough, Subbaiah! You’ve had way too many already. ‘Cause you won’t be coming from tomorrow… My owner and his son are provoking you deliberately. But by the looks of it, I’m afraid you’ll drink your way to death. Shut up, you fool! I drank yesterday. I’m drinking today. And I’ll drink tomorrow. If you want, I’ll pour you a glass. I’ve got money now. It’s not about the money. If you hear this, you’ll forget all about alcohol. In fact, you’ll run home right away. Tell me. Go ahead. Come on! A guy visited your house today, right? What? You know, that guy who came in the afternoon. Do you know who he is? How do you know that somebody dropped by our house? Wondering who I am? Subbaiah’s son Chinni Krishna. You’re Subbaiah’s son?! The kid who ran away years ago. You’re that kid? Yes. Your mom weeps every day for you. And your dad, he drinks here every night. Your sister isn’t married yet. Alright. You’re home now. Things will fall into place. They should. That is why I’m here. I ran away due to some fight. My parents should think that it was for our own good. Mr. Kasi... Don’t tell them about me until I do so. Why? Please don’t. So you’ve decided to do it your way. Goes with your name, Krishna. You’re sly. Go ahead. See you around. "It's all an illusion!" "An illusion that makes you kill your own" "An illusion that leaves you dazed" "It's too late before you realize it" "It's all an illusion!" "An illusion that turns human into evil" Hey! This knife is used to cut the umbilical cord. It was also used to cut that hen tonight. Let go and he’ll die. Otherwise, I’ll die. "It's all an illusion!"

Subbaiah must be at the toddy shop. I should meet him. Hey… Listen! Where is he? Chinni! Chinni! Chinni! Chinni! Chinni! It’s our Chinni. It’s our Chinni. Chinni! "It's all an illusion!" "It's all an illusion!" Money is not permanent. I have it today. Tomorrow, it will be yours. Our Chinni! Chinni! Chinni! It’s gone! It’s gone! Mom, Chinni cut my hair. Oh, no! How could you cut her hair? What’s wrong with you? Idiot! Why are you laughing when I’m hitting you? You idiot! You’re still laughing? You’re so dead! I’m going to beat you up. Stay here. Where is he? Hey, Chinni! Stop! You think I’ll spare you? Hey, stop! Chinni! Stop right there! Go away! Don’t come back! I’ll kill you if you do. Don’t touch him! Don’t touch him. None of us have the right to touch him. No. It’s my fault, mom. No. It’s my fault! It’s my fricking fault! My fault! Giving birth to him was my fault. My fault! Chinni! "It's all an illusion!"
