It's okay, once in a while. Here, can you guess? How many marbles do I have in my hand? You have four! Hey! You’re right, four! Rara. Isn't that too much? Honey! It's for her own good, Honey. It's her growth period. Let her be. Sis. You want some? Lulu... are you eating chocolate? Uh... No, it's mine, Mom. We’ll have dinner soon, don't eat snacks. What’s the matter with you? Giving bad influences to your sister. Rara? What are you doing? Hey. You don't have to be like this. You don't have to be like Mom. Hmm, my little girl. Keep pouting. Listen to me, okay? I know... that you have a good heart. That's what’s important for me. Hm? That's more like it. High five. - Ugh, Dad! - Gotcha! Hello? Huh? - Our condolences. - Thank you. Dad! MULTIPLE-VEHICLE COLLISION AT JAGORAWI HIGHWAY, 8 KILLED Rara. Don’t eat so much rice. Rara! Thank you. HOUSE FOR SALE Gosh. I don’t know what else to say, seeing you like a stranded whale. Get up, take a shower. And put on some make-up, okay? They’re gathering downstairs. IMPERFECT CAREER, LOVE &amp; WEIGHT SCALE Rara! You look a bit fatter, huh? It's okay, you look fresh. Do you have a boyfriend? I do, Auntie. She does. She actually has one, Sis! - You do, right? - Ra? It’s Auntie Magda. Hi, Ra. Hello, Auntie. You still work at... Where's that? Um... That local make-up company? - Yes. - Yes, she is. Research department, but still just staff. Not a manager yet, Sis. Mom, I ordered the ice cubes. - Oh okay, thanks. - You're welcome. - Hello, Auntie! - Hi! You sisters are so different. Lulu, gosh! You always look so beautiful. Sorry, excuse me. Oh, Dika. I thought you were an ojek driver. Sorry. Hi, Lu. Hold this. You’re late. Only five minutes. Five minutes is torture for me, you know? Where are you going, Ra? Teaching. Ma’am. Use sunblock, okay? Yeah. Come on, come on! Use sunblock? Hey, hello. Hi. - Hi, Georgie! - Hi. Congratulations. Two million followers. Wow! Thank you, Auntie. It all thanks to work hard, stay humble. Oh, right. Not bad. Are you wearing this outfit? Uh... What’s wrong? Babe. You wore this outfit before, remember? Last month on my Instagram, remember? Oh. Um... Alright then, I'll go get changed first. Yeah, I think so. Babe, by the way. The coffee shop has a white background. So maybe you can wear something not white... or you know, off-white. The color won’t look good. - Okay? - Okay. He’s so smart, huh? - Yes? - Yup. Ah it’s nothing, Auntie. LENTERA SCHOOL Come on, come on in. Today we’ll learn about the islands in Indonesia, okay? This is the island of Sumatra. And this is the Java Island. Now, we are here. Precisely in the city of... Jakarta! Smart. A lot of people can donate money. But those willing to spare their time and effort... that's rare. Thank you, Dika. Why me? It’s Rara, Mom. I just tag along, taking pictures. Yes, yes. Thanks, Ra. Yes, you're welcome, Ma'am. Anything else that we help you with, Ma’am? There is something. What is it? Find me a husband. I bet you’re too picky. Do you believe in the zodiac? I don't believe in the zodiac. Oh. Chinese zodiac. Chinese zodiac. I'm a Water Monkey. So I'm compatible with Earth Rats. Water will be absorbed by Earth. Mm. I’ve been meeting with... Ha ha! Fire Rat, Metal Rat. It won’t absorb. Bounce back. You know anyone? Yes, if I see an Earth Rat, I'll let you know. Okay, Mom? Arial Awesome, Man. - Just a minute, okay? - Yeah. - Looking for an Earth Rat? - No! Vina? Hey. What’s wrong? Sis Rara, Gugun and Edo won’t let me play the game. Oh. Come on, come here. Gosh! You guys, couldn't stop when you start playing. We’re doing “mabar”, Sis Rara. What is "mabar"? "Mabar" is playing game together. “Nobar" is watching movie together. “Bubar” means the crowd disperse. Alright, enough playing game, okay? - Aw! - Take that! Hey, look here. I have marbles. Why don’t you try to guess... how many marbles do I have in my hand. Um. Ah, I know! One! There are two between her fingers. It's hard when you rarely eat vegetables. Whatever! Come on, how many? Maybe five. Seven! Are you sure? Tadaa! Smarty pants! Eat those vegetables! Alright. Sis Rara, again. Okay, look here. - Uh, Dik? - What? It seems like the colors are too much. Just replace them with brown. - The color will look bad. - It's okay, just change to brown. - Change to brown? - Yes, just change to brown. Cha, replace their top with brown! - Both? - Yes, both of them. Dik? The colors are not good enough. That jacket is too brown. - Well, you replaced the red one... - Cha, please get the red one. There, the red one. - Which one? - Here, this one. I like this one. - Okay. - This one is too brown. Let's change, girls. Dika? Acting smart, but so stupid. You saw it yourself, right? Giving me a headache, really. If I didn’t need the money, I wouldn’t have taken this job! I would have left him! So annoying! I love you. - Sorry, okay? - It’s okay. Okay, let’s get this done. - You can do it. - Yeah. Dik, we’re going to go hang out. It’s Kayla's birthday. Come with us. Gosh, I need to take my girlfriend home. That’s your girlfriend? Yes. Bye now. Oh, okay Fixed, I’m sure she put a spell on him. - Aren’t they beautiful? - Gosh, here we go again! They are. Slim, fair-skinned. - So? - Well, nothing. How come you're not embarrassed taking me with you? I am embarrassed. But what else can I do? - I'm serious. - Yeah, I’m kidding. Ra, in my line of work. Always meeting people like them. You will see a lot of interesting things which are not visible on the surface. Finding a beautiful girl is easy. The hard thing is finding a suitable one. You are beautiful and suitable. - Oh yeah! - What’s with you? Ew, Dika! That’s gross! - Whatever. - It’s dirty, you know! Don't ever change, okay? Yeah. Okay, so what’s up, guys? A lot of you asked in my DM. "George, who exactly is this Lulu?" Well let me tell you. Alright. Lulu and I, we're actually a couple. We are? Come on, Babe. She’s so old-school, guys. She wants formal, I give her formal, okay? Here we go. You’re ready? Lulu? Do you want to be my girlfriend? You see? That's it, Man! Easy, so simple, guys. The important thing in life is we have to work hard and stay humble. And everything else will be good. Alright? Bye bye. Look, look! We have a lot of viewers! Oh my God! You’re quite profitable, Babe. Don't touch my hair. That was good. Look at my skin. So bright and radiant, right? And I just applied it once... Sis, wake up. Mom’s calling for breakfast. Gosh! Your skin! So bright and radiant! Ow! What’s with you, Sis? You're white since birth! “Do you want to have a bright and glowing skin like mine?" “Use Pearl Cream..." Public deception! Lin, please hand me the knife. Yes, Mom. Here, Mom. Lin, when you hand a knife... point the handle like this. Right. Sorry, Mom. Won’t you be late, Rara? How do you know it's me? The stairs tremble differently. That thing I forwarded to you yesterday. Have you posted it yet? All done, Mrs. Manager. Good girl. Remember your thighs, Ra. Sorry. What's your salad today? Dragon fruit, strawberries. Lanzones. You are strange. - Morning. - Morning. Whew, porridge again, huh? Ra, remember your fat. Uh, but that's okay. Nutrition for pregnant woman. You just gonna let them call you pregnant? Ugh, if I protest, they’ll call me sensitive. It's the same either way. Come on, Ra! What’s with the nuts? Extra toppings, to keep you busy. Thanks for the new design. These are great. So many! Many? Only two. These nuts! Oh. Maybe it’s the season. So, what should we give as a gift? For who? For her child. Whose child? Who? She’s pregnant, right? Wow, you're weird. You’re weird! Eating salad with lanzones! After eight exciting years. Together with Malathi. I have to say. That today... is my last day here. Isn't that right, Kelvin? Thank you and success to you all, friends. Read them right. If you get asked by the reporters... just repeat my answers. Okay. What about Sheila? It's done. Good. Bye. Excuse me. Can we share the table? Uh... We're waiting for a friend, right? Yes, waiting for a friend! Okay, let us sit here for now. When your friend comes, we’ll move, it's okay. Yes, but our friend is already near. Yes, very near. - There! - There! Yes, that one’s our friend too. We have two friends. But we’re not too close to that one. But still a friend. Ra. There. Eating Padang rice with a spoon? So what? That’s not exciting! Like you’re on a wedding night. But your room is next to your in-law's. So? You can't "oh, oh". "Oh, oh"? Oh! Oh! Are you crazy? But it’s not fun, right? Moreover if the air con is shared. There’s a hole on the wall like that. Can you imagine? More difficult for you to, oh! Okay, okay! I’ll eat with my hands! That’s more like it. Good! You! Fey. What’s with Ms. Sheila? So sudden. Maybe it’s your good luck. I'm happy in Research. Aw, pretending you don’t want to be promoted. Yet I know, actually your heart's beating fast, right? Manager, manager, manager. Manager, manager, manager! What’s with you? I’m fine. Gosh, Ra! My bra smells like rendang. That’s why you eat Padang rice with a spoon. - Hi, Ra. - Hi. Your shoes are cute. Thanks. But try to use high heels. You’ll look more attractive. She’s afraid of getting tripped. Leave her alone, Marsha. Excuse me, Sir. Is the table still in use? Oh the table. We’re not using it. This chair isn't used either. Please use it. Please. Come on. Just sit, don't just stand. You’ll get varicosis. Come. Come on, it's fine. Come on, we still have enough seats. - Thank you. - Thank you You're welcome. Like a Ki-Pop girl band. Ki-pop? K-pop. You bumpkin. Hey. Do I look fat? No, you're pretty. Please. You’re prettier, Ren. You’re prettier, Sha. You are! - You! - Gosh! Please, I’m prettier. Right? Hey, by the way ... some say that Ms. Sheila didn’t resign, but was fired. - How come? - Budget saving maybe? Because she's a senior, her salary was huge. Maybe it's true? Our company is going bankrupt. Hey, stop saying weird stuff. Well anyway, that means now the position of Marketing Manager is available. Now, get ready to replace Ms. Sheila. Gosh! I don't think I'm ready. But I’ll be with Mr. Kelvin more often. Oh. Marsha. See, eat salad for lunch like them. Not Padang rice. No way. Salad has no bones to nibble. Let me have some, Ra. Is it good? Are you done? Patience, Maria! You can’t rush a good result. Actually you can do it faster... if you use two eyes. - Just open your bangs! - Ah, I’m embarrassed! My mole will be everywhere! Your mole just stays there. There is no mole in this world that goes everywhere. You talk too much, shut up. This will take longer. Your head is wasting electricity. Morning. Morning, Bro Dika! Bro Dika, morning! I’m going. Be careful, Bro Dika! Bro Dika, be careful! - You just flip my words. - Ouch! I only ask for two more weeks, Mom. Alright. But massage me stronger. On it! Don't worry, Mom. Ouch! Ugh! Are you trying to crack my skull? Sorry, Mom. I thought if I massaged you harder... you'll give me more time for the rent You’ll give me concussion! Why are you closing your eyes? Oh, nothing, Bro. Your smell is enough. I bet you can’t pay your rent. Hey, Bro Dika. Who says I can’t pay? I’m just... waiting for the right time, right Mom? Yes, Dika. It's alright. Hey, Rara will come by later, right? - Do you plan to cook? - A little. - Okay. Bye, Mother. - Mm. Bye, Neti. Bye, Love. Bye, Bro Dika. Bye, Mother. Mom, don’t you want one? A daughter-in-law who is good at giving cream bath? Do you know someone? Please introduce her to me. What the heck? Ouch! Ouch! ♪ Endah, will always love you! ♪ Are you okay, Endah? I’m okay, Bro Dika. I need to go, okay? - Be careful, yeah? - Yes. I told you, right? Don't harass the girls in my mom’s boarding house. I didn't harass her. I was just... asking her to sing together. Featuring. A duet. Duet, Stupid! He doesn't understand. Bumpkin! Bro. How come you didn't hit him, Bro? - Mm? - Hit him! I just hit him, but so fast! - You hit him like that? - Yeah, pay attention! He’ll be in pain tomorrow. That’s the side effects? Not side effect, sick effect! So, that's my version of campus make-up tutorial. And I hope you don't get bored watching me. See you on the next video. Bye! CAN ANYONE GET BORED WATCHING YOU? TELL ME HOW. - YOU’RE SO PRETTY. - THANK YOU FOR THE TUTORIAL. SO CONFIDENT, MISS. YOUR ROUND FACE IS COVERING THE SCREEN. Yes, five, six, seven, eight. Three, four. Good! One, two, three, four! Woo! Okay. Hi, Lu. Tell George to come here. I’ll be embarrassed. It’s just us. What are you embarrassed about? I’ll be embarrassed of you, not of George. You want to ask him for a selfie, right? Selfie? No way! Boomerang. Alright, we’ll be going. Bye, see you. Lu, let's go home. Mom, is my face that round? Quite round. Bye! Her body doesn’t make sense, huh? Rumor has it, she wants to enlarge her butt. See what I mean? I can’t understand netizens with their hashtag body goals. These celebrities go to the doctor. This is not body goals. But money goals! Well, not all of them. Yeah, not all of them. But a lot of them. Okay then. I need to go see Mr. Kelvin. See you. Can I finish this? Save half for me! - How long is the period? - A month, Sir. Come in, Ra. Our campaign idea is good. But it uses too many circling words. So it’s not going anywhere. - So what should we do, Sir? - Well, it’s your department. Have another meeting with our agency. Okay. Thank you, Sir. Come, Ra. Our FGD results are okay. It’s good, Sir. In the 18-24 range, our approval rating is stable. In 15-18, it rose significantly. So this new design is worth a try, Sir. Okay, good. Since Sheila is no longer with us, you can report straight to me, okay? Okay, Sir. Um... If I may know... who will replace Ms. Sheila, Sir? Look, Ra. Hey, what’s wrong? What's wrong with you? You look stupefied after meeting Mr. Kelvin. You got fired? Or proposed? If not, then what? [Mr. Kelvin] We both know you’re the most capable. But the problem in our industry, what's inside your head is not enough. Appearance is also important. Because we have to represent Malathi brand when we meet the media, investors, all sorts of people. I will recommend Marsha to my mom. She’s not as senior as you are, but I think we can guide her. Gosh, why can’t you two just merge? Your brain and her look! What the heck? That's not fair, Ra. You’re the most suitable candidate to replace Ms. Sheila. Well, that's your opinion. Huh? Then what’s this? Whose award is this? Yours, right? Never mind. Maybe it’s not my luck. What else did Mr. Kelvin say? Mr. Kelvin is so charming, huh? He said our campaign was good. Nice! Wise. And smart. Of course. How else could he be a boss at such a young age? This is his mom’s company. Nice! Sha, you're new, but skyrocketed right away. I'm sure you can replace Ms. Sheila. How can Rara be worthy of leading us? Lead us? How about she learn to wear make-up first? Come on. Sorry we have to walk. This is why you shouldn’t date a street boy. It’s okay. This street boy is nice. Why are we walking? It’s unusual. The neighborhood chief’s wife is sick. I don't want to disturb her. Hey, Dik. Ms. Sheila suddenly resigned. Really? And then, Mr. Kelvin said to me. He actually wants me to replace her. But he said Marsha is more worthy. Because what's inside the head is not enough... Appearance is also important. He said that? Seriously? Then he also told me. He wished the two of us could be merged. My brain... but with Marsha’s looks. Why did he talk crazy like that? If he doesn't choose you for that reason, that’s his loss. - Really? - Yes, that’s his loss! You have nothing to lose. You have me. Oh yeah! What’s with you? What about your new workplace, Mar? It's nice. My boss is fun. She doesn’t have a problem with you being a Christian working in a hijab store? She’s fine with it. But actually I’m the one who’s worried. Huh? What are you worried about? Worried about the temptation to wear one. At first, I was just trying. Looking myself in the mirror. I looked kind of pretty. Well, praise be to Allah, Mar. Congratulations! Hold on a second! Ugh! My name is Maria, you know! Mother of Jesus. - You know Jesus? - I know. The one with the long hair? Well this is His mother. Oh. The burden is big. Neti's burden is bigger. Hey, you just envy me. Hey, just so you know. Guys these days... they prefer girls like me. Thick. Take Bro Dika for example. Just look at Ms. Rara. If Ms. Rara is not with him, I’ll definitely be the one he’ll choose. Is that so? Right, right. I'm dead! Ms. Rara, Bro Dika. Hello. Why didn’t you tell me? You're toasted. Miss, she was insulting you. Hey, don’t provoke! Says who? I’m proud of being the same type as Ms. Rara. Right, Miss? Aren’t you girls cute? Dika's Rara is cuter. Aw! Ah! Ah! - Control yourself! - Ask forgiveness, Girl! Is your mother cooking? - Apparently, just a little. - Oh. Yes! Just a little! Aw, just a little. Neti, you're so messed up. So we eat noodles again? Is the variety of dishes not enough? Ma’am, where are the bride and the groom? You two are! - Amen! - Oh yeah! This is what I want. Mother. Take more rice. Oh, sure. Enjoy your meal. - Let’s eat, Mom. - Yes. Is it good? Of course, look at her eyes rolling. I want to hear it from her. Do you mind? Really delicious, Mom! - There. Satisfied? - Thank you. Very satisfied. Ha ha! Try the vegetables and the others. Now, these photos were taken using this camera. One of the inheritance from Dika’s father. How come he never use it, Mom? Is it broken? It's not broken. It’s just that the results... are somewhat less perfect. Mother, normally inheritance makes you rich. I apologize. This kid is rather insolent. I’ve been planning to curse him into gold. Stone, Mother. Why gold? - Stone! - Gold is better! It can be pawned, right? Yes, yes. [Mr. Kelvin] We both know you’re the most capable. But the problem in our industry, What's inside your head is not enough. Appearance is also important. [Sha] Lead us? How about she learn to wear make-up first? [Mom] Yes, Research department. [Mom] But still just staff, not a manager yet, Sis. [Fey] That's not fair, Ra. You’re the most suitable candidate to replace Ms. Sheila. This works best with your skin color. It's nice. When you eat chocolate... usually you’re having a lot of thoughts. If you have a problem... find a solution. If you’re like this, things won’t get better, and you’ll get fatter. What’s wrong, Sis? Had a fight with Dika? No, office problem. Never mind, Lu. Why don’t you tell me first. Maybe I can give you some advice. This is an ugly people's problem, Lu! You will never understand! My boss resigned. I should be the one replacing her. But they choose someone more beautiful. More cool. All this time you must have thought that I treated you badly. People out there can be more wicked, Sis. I told you to watch what you eat. Taking care of your body. That's all for you. Not for me. It's proven now, right? Actually, ability-wise, you are more worthy. But you can't compete. Anyway... don’t you want to be loved more by... Dika? Even though he said he likes you just the way you are. But well, if you look better... wouldn’t he be happy? Right, Lu? Rara? Rara? Rara? You forgot to turn on the alarm. Get up. Gosh! Are you sure? Yes, if you give me time. One month. If you can change in one month... I'll give you my trust. Thank you, Sir. Yeah. You’re done? Alright! Now what? You’re confusing me. Well, it's not that easy. Within a month, I have to change my appearance. Getting slimmer. This is your chance! You've been wanting to get slimmer. No, I don’t. Says who? Gosh, this belly. I feel like cutting it off, you know? These models are insane. What do they eat? Tissue papers, I think. That’s hard to swallow. Wet wipes, maybe. Rice. And fried. Double the sin. When will I be thin? Are you going to finish that? Okay, okay! Then what should I do now? Don't stare as if I can help you! Well, at least give me some ideas where I should start. Eating tissues, maybe? Fey! Okay okay, sorry. Easier to swallow. Get lost! You’re useless! I want to help. I apologize, Mom. Yes, Mrs. Tuti. All this time, you have been... very kind to our family. Actually I don't want to bring this up. But because of necessity... I need you to... pay off the remaining debt. I understand. Well then, I'll take my leave. Come on, Ali. What's wrong, Mar? This. My hair is so dry. Ugh! Mm, you straightened it too often, “mereun”. Maroon? Are you color blind? My hair is black. "Mereun", Maria! "Mereun" means “possible”. Oh. Or perhaps you rarely wash your hair. Ah, that’s not “mereun”! Hey, that's not how you use it! "Mereun" means... “maybe”, not “possible”. Besides when it comes to shampooing I actually do it frequently. Sometimes in a week I can do it... “mereun” three times. Sometimes “mereun” four times. That’s how you use it, right? Awesome. Ah, you're lucky... Curly hair can be straightened. I have curly teeth. They're hard to straighten, you know? Use dental braces. That’s expensive. Dear God! This kid is such a bumpkin. They have a lot on Instagram. You can buy one for fifty thousand Rupiah. Are they good? I guess they should be. Because they’re colorful. What kind of braces are those? Hoax. I bet they use old wires. From where? From... Your bra, Neti! Gosh, why do you hang it like this? Taking up space! Gosh! It was soaking wet, Emprit! If I hang it like this... it will get stretched! Do you want my bra to reach down here? - Ugh! - Hey! Your bra isn't stretched because of the way you hang it! Its workload is too heavy! Well, they are heavy. I just don’t get it. Why do people want to enlarge them? I want to reduce them. They’re heavy, suffocating. If possible, I’ll share some for you. Ugh, no way! My back will break. Anyway, I'm comfortable like this, cost-effective. Ah, cost-effective my butt! - Move away! - Hey, look! I never changed my bra since junior high. Is that a bra or panties? A beanie! Give it to me! No way, don’t you dare! - I need to dry this! - Morning, what are you doing? Hi, I’m testing the strap. It’s quite strong, import quality. Even Bro Dika likes it. How is this possible, Mother? Well, what can I say? The cost of your father’s medical treatment... we borrowed it from her. Yes, but the loan was paid off. But not the interest. When Father died, didn’t she say she'd write off the interest? She didn’t write it off. More precisely... she didn't have the heart to collect it. Next month, she will need the money. How much, Mother? No, Son. I don't want you to think about it. - I’ll try to... - How much, Mother? Forty million Rupiah. Alright, don’t worry. You don't need to get stressed. I’ll try to get the money, okay? Don't worry about it. I’m leaving. Okay, Mother? All done, the client is happy. That's good. You look so stressed, like you're being chased by debts. I am being chased by debts. My mother. Oh. Sorry. Actually I need to make a more money. Photo shoots like this... you know how much they pay. Well, you have to take a risk, like me back then. In a competition? Yes, it is annoying. All the effort, and it’s not certain that you’ll win. Well, okay. But to add my income, just in case you refuse some job. Pass them to me, will you? - Yeah? - I can’t promise you. - Alright! - No. I can’t promise you. - Promise me. - Don't burden me! - No, you're so kind. Thank you. - You're burdening me! Don't, no promise! Ouch, Dik! Wiwid, don’t get drunk, okay? As if. I never get drunk. You just don't realize it, Wid. Really? Record the video please. Hey. You girls want to go hang out? Can I come along? Let's go. - What? - Are you sure you want to eat like this? Uh’huh. Why? Well, who knows, if you become thin... you can be... my crew. Hey, Ra? Why are you taking my plate? A crew has to eat a lot. Just kidding! - Give it back. Ouch. - I’m upset! DIK, THERE’S A CONTEST. THE PRIZE IS NOT BAD. TOTAL PRIZE: 25 MILLION RUPIAH Hi, guys. If you want to have thin face like Korean artists... - SIS LULU IS GETTING PRETTIER. - SAY HI TO @king-george FOR ME. - THIS IS @king-george’s NEW GIRLFRIEND? - STANDARD WHITE GIRL, NOTHING SPECIAL. Lu? Yeah, Sis? What’s wrong with you? Huh? Lu, these people are just attention seekers. They want you to notice them. Lu. Hey. Why do you have to think about people’s opinion? They don’t even think before they comment, Lu. Hm? It’s unusual for you to be this nice. - Mm? - Do you want something? Let’s try using eye shadow. Wait! Not on me, you try it. It's okay. See? You’re actually pretty. Not bad. You've got something to make my face thinner? I do. Want some? No! - Here you go. - Thank you. Won’t you starve just eating apples? No. - Hi, Lu. - Hello, Ms. Michelle. - Rara - Hello, I'm Michelle. Miss, don't forget to torture her. Will do. Let's take your weight. If you want to reach 60 kilos in a month... it's still possible. Your body’s water percentage is high. So you can lose weight faster… if you watch what you eat and do a lot of cardio. What’s wrong? Too fast? Uh, just feel a little rushed. Okay. Let's slow it down. When was your last treadmill, Ra? Um... It's been a long time. A month? A year? Um... Elementary school. At the gym? No, at the mall. There was this fitness equipment exhibition. Okay. Alright then, I'll come back later, okay? What’s this? Too slow like a snail. It's my first time! Lu, enough! Hey! Lulu! Goodness! Sir? Miss? Help. Gosh. Hello? Now, I know you need more job. - Alright! - Hold on, hold on. I have to ask you first. Just take it! No, the problem is this client is a bit weird. How weird can it get? Err... Anyway, I want it to be totally glam. We’re celebrating 100.000 followers. Your followers? Nope. Jaden's followers. Jaden... Um... How should I pose him? Well, it's up to you. You said you use to direct models. Yes, human models. They can stand. You think Jaden can't stand? Jaden! Jaden! Stand up, Boy! Up, up! See, he’s not in the mood. Because of your negative aura! Go on, handle him! Uh, one more thing. Take his left angle, okay? Okay. Stop, stop. Hey! Don’t stand there, Boy. You're ruining my background. Jacob, eh what's your name? Jaden. Ugh, making my life complicated! You should’ve select your work. How can I be selective? I'm in need. Whatever. Hey. Malathi will soon celebrate its one decade birthday. I can recommend you for documentation. It'll be a relaxing event at the office. - Deal? - Mm. - You can do it. - I can do it. Are you really going to eat like this for a month? - No. - Oh good. I’ll eat like this until I die. Better not. Really. You’ll get stressed. - Stressed? - Mm. What is stress? Hm? Wow. It’s fixed, you’re stressed. Can I go now? You’re scaring me. - Sir, can you call the security? - Dika! Hey! What is "White" in Indonesian? "Blue"? How about "black"? Hey, your face is black! Better than your slanted eyes! Hey, don’t do that. It's called "body shaming," embarrassing other people about their body. Please don’t, okay? That Gugun, Sis. Why me? You always mock my buck tooth. Hey. Anyway, you can't insult people like that, understand? Ma'am, I want to tell you something. Eh? Have you found an Earth Rat? No, it's not about rat. - Later, I'll let you know. - I’ve been waiting. No, Rara will have her birthday soon. Oh, so? So, I have a plan. How’s your contest preparations? The backdrop is finished. Just need a model. Um, the model... Hey, why don’t we just ask Rara's sister? Oh, right. You're smart sometimes. Only your look is stupid, huh? What was that? You just look stupid, but smart. So is that a compliment or not? - A compliment. - A compliment, huh? Um... Thanks. Why are your eyelashes so long? Huh? Whatever. George likes them. He said they distract attention from my cheeks. Hello. - Hello, Ms. Tari. - Ms. Lulu. - How are you? - I’m good. I’ll leave my sister to you, okay? Is this really you sister? - Yes. - Oh. Biological? Yes, Miss. Same womb? Yes, same womb. She resembles our late dad. - Oh, I see. - I resemble our Mom. You two are cute, no? Like stripes. Miss, can you please hurry? Yes, calm down. Just relax. Lu, it won't hurt right? A little. Like an ant bite. Oh, an ant bite. Doggone it! What kind of ant is this, Lu? Uh, Sis Rara, Dika is calling. Uh... Maybe later. What the Devil! Can’t you wait? I’m talking here! It's better when you’re not ready, Miss. Hello, Dika. Huh? Lulu? Where’s Rara? Have mercy, God! What’s wrong, Lu? Uh. Everything's fine, Dika. It hurts! Hey Lulu, what’s wrong? Where are you two? What's going on? Sis Rara and I are at the, uh... Ah! Hot! Hey Lu, seriously! What's wrong with Rara? - Wait, I’ll take a picture, okay? - I can’t stand it! Gosh, she's getting waxed! - Goodness. - Don’t let her beat you. Your hair is so crowded, like a labor factory. - You jerk! Gosh! - What is this waxing? Treatment for removing hair, Auntie. What hair? Any hair! Ah, interesting. What the heck, Mother! Dika, my hair is my business. Why are you upset? I’ll take you there. Hey Teddy, no! - No. - Don't do anything weird. I mean not you, Dika can take me there. - Ah, nice! - No, don’t! Why would you? It hurts, Mother! You need this, you know? How come I need it? Let’s do it together, side by side! Auntie, Mother's Day is coming. Take a Mother and Child package, buy one get one free. - See, buy one get one free. - No, no need. I'm so weak whenever I hear "buy one get one free". Ouch! Gosh Mother, it hurts! - Gosh, Mother! - They’ll do that to you! Mother, seriously! You pulled a lot! Gosh, it really hurts! The concept for the contest, Dika will explain it to you, Lu. Okay. Okay, please help him out. - Will do. - Thank you, Lu. - Mm. Bye. - Bye. INSTANT DIET STRICT JUICE DIET Okay, let's try ten, okay? Lift it steadily, don’t let it shake. Ugh! Good, keep your hands straight. And one. Good job! Please make her hair neat. Make it look more beautiful. Sis, I think this one is cute. Yes, that one is really pretty. That's awesome. Good luck to all of us. Are you ready? Yes, I’m ready, Sir. Because honestly, your task will be heavy. Our sales keep dropping. So try to evaluate our campaign for the past year. Also try to think about what strategy we can use... in the future, especially online. Mm okay, yes. Auntie, I need to go. To an orphanage. I’m having this giveaway event. Also I’ll be giving motivation to the children. Let them work hard, stay humble. Gosh, George is awesome. Secretly he likes to do charity. No, Auntie. Not secretly. I’ll bring reporters. Bye, Babe. He is great. Still young, but independent. Yes, but George likes to tell me how to dress. It's alright, Lu. It's normal for men to be like that. If you're with George... it will boost your career. You will gain followers fast. Endorsements will come to you smoothly. Nice indeed. Huh? George, why are you back? The reporters canceled, Auntie. Alright, maybe some other time. Wait for the reporters. Miss? One manicure-pedicure. Excuse me, Ma'am. May this servant come in? You’re annoying. What's up, Fey? Nothing, just visiting. Your office is quite big, huh? Like a district office. And you have a sofa. Ra, come here! - Draw me. - Huh? Like in “Titanic”, Jack and Rose. You mean Feni Rose! On Monday, my price will go up. Hey Fey, according to you... which one will make me look more charismatic? They’re the same. If you want to look charismatic... wear a mustache. - You’re useless. - Ra. You don't need lipstick color to make you look charismatic. You just need to prove that you deserve to be there. The important thing is the brain, Ra. And mustache! In fact, wear Mr. Raden's moustache. - You wear it! - I’m sure people will respect you. "Pardon me, Ms. Rara. Excuse me, Ma'am." Okay, next question. “I prefer George with his ex, Manda.” “Manda is much prettier.” No! Lulu is on a diet. She will lose her weight, don't worry. I'll make sure. You want to say hi? Chubby. Now, say hi. - Hi. - Hi, Cindy! Alright, we got to go, yeah? Thank you for your questions. And always remember. Work hard, stay humble. Uh... George? Do you really have to answer questions like that? If I don't answer, they’ll think I’m arrogant. I’ll lose my followers, then what? That won't be cool. - Right? - Yeah. What is it? Nothing. I'm just amazed at your efforts. - You don't like it? - See? You’ve changed this drastically, and you’re still insecure. I’m not. Alright, let's cheers. For Ms. Marketing Manager who will have her birthday soon. - Oh, I am? - What do you mean? I forgot. Wow, you're too much. What a mess. Gosh! Always straightening your hair like a career woman! Look at the bathroom sink. Full of your hair. See, Mar? What did I told you? Stop straightening your hair, okay? You’ll become bald! Well, what to do? I'm embarrassed with my broccoli hair. No. Broccoli are green. Well, who said broccoli are purple? Just wear a hijab, Mar. You're not helping, Endah. Mar. Just let it go, it’s okay. If your hair is originally like that... well, just accept it. Good or not good, it depends on you. If you're confident, you can look cool. Just look at Ronaldinho. Why are you bringing up Ronaldinho? The point is just let it go. You don't need to feel "insesure". - Hah? - What? You know, like in that online trend. Today's women tend to feel "insesure". Insecure. Yes, "inseksure". Not like that. - In. - In. - Se. - Se. - Cure. - Cure. - Insecure. - "Insexcure". No need to use "sex", Neti. Insecure! So what exactly does it mean? Endah, tell her. Insecure means you don’t feel confident. Always feel like something is lacking. That’s right, Baby. So, instead of feeling insecure... we should be grateful. True. You’re clever today. Did you take fish oil? Yeah. Huh? Do fishes have oil? They do, after getting massaged. Fish massaged. It got sprained? What was it doing? Running around. - Fishes swim, right? - Yeah. - Hi, Ma'am. - Yes. What were they doing, Mother? Nothing. Threatening you? Nobody’s threatening me. Then what were they doing? I’ll let you have my motorcycle’s certificate. I’ll pay the rest. Gosh. Hey! Photographer! You better print money instead of photos, Stupid! Ali! Yes, Mom! A minute! Punishment? Hello? With Dika’s Rara? Yes, Dik? Are you busy now? Pretty much. Why? It’s nothing. I just need to tell you something. Okay, maybe later. - Really? - Yeah, it's fine. Okay, bye. Let's travel! What’s up, Dik? Fey, Rara is really busy, huh? Ask her yourself. Why using the middleman? Am I a land broker? No, I just don't want to disturb her. Well, she is really busy right now. But I think she's happy. Oh, good then. Hey Dik, she’s coming. I need to go. Ok, bye. Let's eat at the food court. What for? You don't eat rice anymore. You only drink plants. - Huh? - This grated plants. You mean blended. It’s the same. A blender is a grater, just uses electricity. Fine. Come on. Just a second. Fey, don't you want to try to dress more feminine? What are you saying? Hey, seriously. You’ll look good. No! This is the lady from that time, right? Huh, so slim! A diet, maybe? Must be diarrhea. My girl’s treatment is expensive, but a diarrhea is better. She should have a diarrhea. Ra, come here! Sit with us. - Come on. - Are you sure? Yes, it's hard to find a table. Fey, just pull a chair. Fey, there's an empty chair. Gosh, your shoes are so cute, Ra. Thanks. Turns out it's not that hard once you get used to them. Right? Fey, you hear that? Don't you want to try wearing high heels? Just try it, Fey. You’ll feel more... dignified. That’s right, Fey. It's also good for your posture. Okay, uh... I’ll sit over there. Can I sit here? - Hey... - Hey, Ra. What juice do you have today? Yeah, it’s kiwi and cucumber. Is it delicious? It's delicious. Such a unique combination. Ra, by the way, we’re sorry for talking bad about you all this time. Yeah, forgive us, Ra. Yes, Ra. Please forgive them, okay? Huh? You too! Yes, it's alright. But it’s true. All this time, Wiwid is the kindest. Wow! - She stands up for Wiwid! - I never do anything to her! Wow. The color concept will be like this. About the model or fabric, it's up to you. As you see fit. - Okay. - Yeah? Sorry, guys. Is this going to take long? I have to wash my hair. - Wash your hair? - Come on! I got endorsement from this shampoo, Babe. You said you’ll record the video. Come on. Do we have to do it now, George? Babe, the person already sent me the briefing. See? Little ducky is not happy. Little ducky slaps with its shoe. If your hair suddenly gets droopy... just use Pantun Shampoo. Can we go? It's okay if you want to leave first. If you wash your hair late at night, you’ll catch a cold. - Is it okay? - Yeah. - Oh yeah, thank you. - Yes. - Come on. - Really sorry. It's okay, I'll just email it to you later. See you later. It can be emailed! I could’ve washed my hair earlier. What the heck? Vin, where have you been? Well, the usual, Chelle. - Mr. Kelvin. - Huh? Yes? Why do you look so confused? I'm so hectic. I need vacation. How is it, Ra? Hm? Being the new you. Anything different? Ah. It's different, Sir. I was really insecure. Now... I’m more confident. Guys turning their heads now, huh? Pretty much. What about before? They also turn their heads. But in the opposite direction. - Hi. - Hi. - I'm really late, huh? - No. Wear this now, okay? What is this? It’ll make you look cooler. - Quickly, I’ll be waiting here. - No need! It's okay. Okay, one, two... - Dika, let me introduce you to Marsha. - Oh right. - Dika. - Marsha. - You’ve met these two, right? - Not yet! - Oh. - Irene. - Wiwid. - Dika. Okay, Ra. We need to see Mrs. Melinda. - Bye. - Bye. Dika, I better go see her too. Wait a minute, please? - This was... - Yes, wait a minute. Gosh, you look neat today. New outfit? She suddenly gave it to me, I don't understand why. Just wear it. Turns out I'm not the only victim. Hang in there, Dik. Yeah, I can't help it. What are you busy doing? I want to take your pictures. Come here. - Seriously? - Come, hurry. - You look cool. - I'm not a model! It's all right. It should be okay. - All done? - Uh’huh, just watch the wash effect. There’s a large window there. No, I'll close the window later. Okay. If I have more jobs, you won’t refuse? Take it. I'm actually happy. What else? Snake, lizard? Come on. Why are you addicted to reptile photos now? It's fun, not complicated. Less talking. - No, this is a family event. - Uh’huh. But I need to help around, so please take the pictures, okay? Okay, let’s go. Where? Ballroom? Garden? Uh... It's a home. At home? Done. Okay. Great. PELITA KASIH FUNERAL HOME You said it's a family event. It is a family event. Family events are weddings, social gatherings, birthdays... Things like that. So if someone dies, my family can't have an event? You’re talking nonsense. Okay, I leave it to you. Donation box, put in an envelope. Just a formality, not too much Buy an envelope somewhere, okay? - All good? - All good, done. But I can't buy one, a pack. Why did you use that envelope? This is the Year of the Pig, right? - It's not about the animal, Dika! - So? You use white envelope for funerals. Red is for good luck. You want to celebrate other people's grief? What’s with you? I'm not Chinese, how should I know? You didn’t say anything about which color to use! I just bought them! I didn’t know! Just take the pictures! Wait, what pictures should I take? All of them! Including... Of course! - You... - Yes. Don't ask him to pose. All good? Damn it! Goodness! What's with you? You have butter fingers or something? I was about to take the picture! Well, you should've hold it right, hold it tighter! Why did you drop it? Well, take it. Well you take it! You want me to take it? What's with the camera? Oh, that. Grandpa's hobby was photography, Auntie. His favorite camera. Since when did he start to like photography? Don't know. Even his selfies were blurry. Grab it! My camera, Teddy! I was afraid of him when he was alive, moreover now that he's dead! - Now what? - Well, you grab the camera! You were the one who pushed me! Ladies and gentlemen, the priest is here. Soon we will begin the casket closing service. What is this casket closing? Well, closing the casket. There's the lid. What about my camera? - Grab it, I don't care! - I'm scared! - Grab it! - I don't need that camera! Well, I need it! - Shoulders. - Shoulders? Yeah, do the chopping. Like that. Anything for my future mother-in-law. No way. That's how I like it. It feels so good. Excuse me, may I speak with... Mrs. Ratih who is known for her delicious cooking? What are you saying? I'd like to order complete tumpeng rice. For my girlfriend's birthday. Excuse me. Awesome. Alright! We're going shopping! Goodness! Rinse your hair first, Mom! Let's do it on the way. I'M HERE So this is the thread lift procedure? Why didn't you just use Botox? Sis, Botox will make your face stiff. I won't be able to laugh. I can laugh freely like this... With Botox, I'll sound like this. Scary, isn't it? Sis Debby, why don't you try? Using creams will take forever. Sis, you should do the thread lift. It will fasten your facial skin! Like a motorbike! The cost is quite high, Nora. You're right. Hi, Auntie. Mom, I'm going with Dika, okay? Okay, Dear. Rara? Are you... Rara? Which doctor did you go to? Did you do a liposuction? No, Auntie. Just exercise and eat healthily. I'm going, okay? - Bye, Mom. - Take care. How? How did she do it? Hi. Sorry, have you been waiting? We're going to the school, right? Of course. What's wrong? You sure you want to wear this? Why? It's not good? I knew I shouldn't have worn this. It makes my arms look big, huh? Oh no, not that. I have no problem. I'm just concerned that you might be uncomfortable. Oh, I'm comfortable. Oh, okay then. Hey. I called a taxi. Let's go there in a taxi, okay? You can leave your bike here, okay? It's rush hour. And you haven't come for a few days. It will be alright. It's so hot today. Fine, I'll go on ahead. - Huh? - I'll go ahead, it's fine. Let's go together. No, it's okay. - Really? - Yeah really, it's fine. I'm sorry. - Careful. - Yeah. We'll make the most delicious dishes. - Alright! - For Rara. That tempe, bring it here. On it! More eggs. Boil them as well, will you? After you're done taking notes... don't forget your homework. See you next week. - Thank you, Bro. - You're welcome. Thank you, Bro Dika. I'm sorry. The traffic was awful. I told you to come together. What about the good values you taught these kids? One of them is being on time. Yes, Dik. I know. I said I'm sorry, okay? Just forget it. On weekends like this I want to have fun with you. I'm tired from all the office work. Hello. Sis Rara, you're getting thinner. Are you sick? No, I'm fine. Sis Rara, are you going to a wedding? Your dress is so nice, like a celebrity. No, I'm just learning... to improve my appearance. What's wrong with your old appearance? Hey, kids. What are we going to celebrate soon? - Sis Rara's birthday! - Yes! How old are you, Sis? 28. That's old. Hey, 28 is still young, Gun. Even my Mom's still 25. Hey, your Mom got married at young age. Smarty pants! My Mom wasn't married! - Hey! - Take it slow, Man! Somebody's having her birthday! Make a wish! Yeah! Happy birthday, Rara! I pray for your health, success and happiness! Happy birthday. Mom already mentioned all the good wishes. I love you. Ra. Alright. Excuse me, Mom. I gave you a position here so I can have time to develop our new company. I left you for a while and look at this mess. The competition is different from back then. See for yourself. I sent you to school all the way to LA. How can you give up this easily? Well, you sent me to school, but you never trusted me, what's the point? How can I trust you... when you're incompetent? I know you're still new, Ra. But I expected a lot from you. Yes, Sir. I'm sorry. I almost picked Marsha to replace Sheila, but you're the one asking for a chance. Now convince me that I didn't make the wrong decision. Focus! Cross check! Those numbers can't be right! Right, I'll check them again, Sir. Hey. Where are you going after this, Ra? Uh. It's my boyfriend. He planned a birthday party for me. Wow, it's your birthday? Okay, it's fixed. We have to celebrate it together. Let's go have some wine now. Gosh, so sorry. But I think... I won't make it in time. I have to be there at 8.00... There's still plenty of time before 8.00, Ra. The place is near. Just a quick stop. Besides, drinking wine will make you more relaxed. And happier. You're going to see your boyfriend, right? Right? Come on, let's go there! Fine. But I can't stay long, okay? Yeah. Is that the tank? Whoa, slow down. Use your scissors slowly. Spray from a distance, one at a time. One, two... Three! Yeah! Careful. Yeah! To Rara. Success to you always. Thank you. Happy birthday! It's good, right, Ra? Yeah. Don't tell me this is the first time you drank wine. Oh, no. It's been a while. It's okay if you don't like it, Ra. Because not everyone can enjoy fermented beverages like this. Mm. Here we go again. Don't be confused, Ra. When she's drunk, she becomes intelligent. - Oh. - But... .the history of wine is very interesting. According to research... people started to consume wine... Ra. Wake up, Ra. Ra. Uh... Sorry. You said you have to go. It's 8.30 already. Huh? Huh? Right, right. Excuse me! Happy birthday. Thank you, Mom. Please give me a chance to explain. Do you know how my mother prepared all this? She went shopping, cooking. Look at these kids sleeping. They've been waiting for you! Yes, I know I was wrong. I'm sorry. And I know you're helping your mother to pay her debt. I'll pay you back for all this, okay? What more, Dik? I said I'll pay for all this. Not everyone in need of money... will throw away their dignity, Ra. Happy birthday, Sis Rara. Thank you, guys. Ra! Rara! Yes, Fey? Dika told me about last night. How could you? Never mind, you wouldn't understand. About you drinking wine with Marsha? I understand. - I saw her IG. - Yeah, so? You upset we didn't ask you? What's with you? What's with what? Seriously, I ask you. What are you after? I'm going after things that I never had all this time. Is it wrong? You can go after anything you want! But remember, Ra. You can also lose everything you've had. Yes, Lu? Hi, Sis. I need to borrow your red shoes. Is that okay? Yeah, take them. Awesome. It won't be long. Just for Dika's contest photoshoot. Oh right, it's today? Yeah. Yeah, okay then. - Thanks, Sis. - Yeah. - Bye. - Bye. Compared to previous quarters... we're losing 21% income. This is terrible! If it stays like this, this company will go down. We've made maximum effort for our campaign. But if our sales stay low... perhaps we used the wrong strategy from the start. What do you mean? Well, I'm not saying that our research is flawed. It's just that we have to consider all possibilities. If our research is flawed... I wouldn't be sitting here right now. Well, maybe you shouldn't sit there at all. I know. Rara. Me? Rara told me, she was insecure. She wanted to be the center of attention, but she couldn't. Of course, who would be interested in the old Rara, right? But look at Rara now. The keyword is "insecurity". We have to make all females feel insecure. Always lacking something, always not beautiful enough. That way, they will need a change. A change to become more beautiful. With Malathi. - Rara, hey! - Take her. Wow, you're so pale. A diet is fine. But not too extreme. Your blood pressure is so low. In the long run, it might affect your heart. You have your period regularly? It should be last week. Carbohydrate deficiency... may cause hormone imbalance. Okay, I'll write you a prescription. Have you done her hair? - Get it done now. - Yes. What about her eyebrows and lashes? They're good. So, you're ready? You okay with your hair like this? Yes, this is fine. Are you okay with it? Oh it's fine. What's wrong? I'm not too confident. I have an acne. Acne is nothing. I'll delete it later. It's easy. Yeah, but my face is so round. Says who, Lu? People on IG. George, Mom. Everybody calls me chubby. What's wrong if you're chubby? I like it. Like the old Rara. Sorry, may I? Wait. Sorry. Okay. See? You're pretty. Okay? Wow. Uh... Hi, Sis. Why didn't you tell me you're coming? - What are you doing? - Well, what does it look like? This is my own sister, Dika. Yeah, I know she's your sister. So what's the problem? Sis, Dika was just trying to-- Stay out of this! Go climb the social ladder with your famous boyfriend! Hey, Lulu has done nothing wrong. Of course, Lulu has never done anything wrong! Lulu is the kindest, prettiest. Most perfect girl! Right, Lu? - What's wrong with you? - You just don't get it! Yes, I don't get you at all, really! You never understand how it feels to be me! Always being compared, always feeling like I'm lacking! Now I'm like this, and still I'm the wrong one? What, you feel small that I'm more successful? Hm? Those kinds of words would never come out from the old Rara's mouth. What do you mean "the old Rara"? Who's blaming you? - I know you're not blaming me. - I never blame you for anything! But you also never appreciate my efforts! I've gone through all this shit to become like this, Dik! Really, I don't know you anymore. Please, I'm tired! - Enough, Mother. - I'm not done. Son, please have more self control. I'm worried that something bad might happen to you. If you're not here, what will happen to this house? How can I give it to Neti? She'll turn it into a salon. What are you saying, Mother? It's been a while since you lost your temper like this. Usually there's Rara to calm you down. I'm like this because of Rara, Mother. What do you mean? Well, Rara has changed now. Yeah, she's slimmer, prettier. So what's wrong with that? Now she prioritizes her outer appearance. Her make-up, her dress, her hair. Yet for me, the old Rara is perfect enough. You shouldn't be selfish. Why am I selfish? Well, perhaps right now she's searching for her identity. You should stand by her. Whatever the outcome... it's still her life. Not yours. Do you still love Rara? Don't give up. My boy is so weak. Let me kiss you! Arial Come here, I can't reach you. What's with you two? Why did Lulu come home crying? Rara, enough with that chocolate. What about your diet? You care more about my diet than my feeling? Calm down, Ra. What's with you? Go ask your beloved daughter! That prettier, slimmer and flirty daughter of yours! Who do you call flirty? No need to deny, it was obvious! Obvious? What's obvious is that Dika is too good for you! And you don't deserve to be with Dika! What do you know about deserving? You've been a golden child since birth! - Rara! - Well, don't blame me, blame Mom! Enough! I love you both. No, Mom! Only Dad loved me! Everybody knows since we were kids! That you only proud of Lulu! A black and fat kid like me is nothing but a step daughter! I didn't choose to be born like this, Mom! You gave birth to me! Yes. When you were born your weight was 4 kilograms. And that... was something that changed my life forever, Ra. My career as a model was ruined. This is why I... Women are highly valued by their appearance. That is why I asked you to change your way. I love you, Ra. Forgive me. Perhaps my way was wrong. I'm sorry. I miss Dad. I think Dad would be proud seeing us like this. Thank you, Ra. You've helped me accept this. Dad would be glad. And I'm sure Dad would be glad if you stop talking about my thighs Gosh. And my cheeks, Mom. Okay. Hey, you want your cheeks to look less round? I do. Make your body fatter to balance things. Excuse me, are you done fighting? Annoying! What is it, Lin? Here, Miss. A courier delivered this, from Mr. Dika. Come on. It's hot and dusty here. Why do you enjoy being here? Since I was a kid, my father used to take me to places like this. Gosh, what for? As if there's nothing better to do. Damnit! Hey, pick it up. You dare? Pick it up! You're littering. Pick it up. What littering? This is a dump yard! Pick it up! See, you got this one wrong. This is some crap. Edo, can you solve this? How's your progress? Edo, you always make the same mistake. You work in a rush, but not thoroughly. If being perfect can make you happy... please give me time to accept that. Because I'm already in love with your imperfection. Aw! How lucky you are to have Dika. Morning. Morning. Whoa. This one's for you without nuts. Fey, this is so good. - You got possessed, Ra? - Yeah. These past few weeks. Now I'm sane again. What's the occasion? The occasion is... an apology. And I'm asking for a favor. A bribe. Please? Help me out? Come with me now, okay? What about this? Your work? I asked Mr. Kelvin's permission. - Okay? - My porridge! You should've eat it right away. Don't just stare at it, here. Say "ah". Did you get me iced tea as well? Oh, taking advantage? - It's hard to swallow. - That's... If you don't drink after you eat. Ugh! So demanding! Ra. - Your tea. - Yes. Thank you, Mom. Dika is getting his camera repaired. How are you, Ra? Mom. Please forgive me. I've disappointed Dika. It's alright. He's a boy. He has to be tough, right? Um. Actually I need to ask a favor. But before that do you know where your boarding house girls are at this hour? I'm so upset! What's wrong, Ma'am? I went to Rudy's salon. You know? I know. Rudy Hadisuwiryo, right? Yes, I had a cream bath there yesterday like this. I was enjoying it. And the stylist left me! - Crazy! - Gosh! Neti! That place used to be fine. Auntie, don't run! - What is it, Ms. Rara? - Help me out, okay? Come with me now. - Of course, Baby! - Okay, get in. We go to Maria, Prita, and Endah. Let's go. Miss, the door handle is missing! Maria! Gosh, why are they here? Hurry! Ma'am, I'll take a short break, okay? What's this? What's going on? - Just get in. - Get in, come on! - Here it is! - Prita! Come here already, hurry! - What's wrong? - We need to help Dika. - Come with us, okay? - Bro Dika? CLOSED CHECK THE STORE NEXT DOOR Endah! - Hurry, Endah! - Now! - What is it, Ms. Rara? - I'll explain it to you later. - Everybody's inside. - So cramped! DIKA, CAN YOU COME TO MY HOUSE? MY MOM WANTS TO SEE YOU. My head, Neti! Everybody ready? - Ready! - We're going! What happened? It's nothing. I bumped my head. I'm sorry. For? For... being unpleasant? And for ruining your photo session with Lulu. That was unpleasant. What to do? Should I forgive you? Forgive me please. I forgive you. Now, come with me. Is this for real? For real. Okay. What did you bump into? I bumped... into your Mom's blessing. Oh yeah! This way. What's this? What's with all this? Wait here. - Can I open this? - Open it. My father's camera? You want me to take pictures with this? The results won't be perfect. You're the one who taught me to love imperfections. Now... go and show everybody. That it's okay to be not perfect. Surprise! Oh, you're behind this too! Come on, I want to be a cover girl! Come on, let's take the pictures. I like your concept. But this is highly risky. But I think it's worth the try. - Are you sure? - Absolutely not. But in times of crisis like this, we need the courage to try. Okay. We'll give it a try. But you take full responsibility. Yes, Mom. Good luck, okay? I'm sure all departments will give maximum support. Isn't that right, Marsha? Definitely. If you ask me, the key to success the most important part is to do a lot of charity. We have to remember that living in this world we coexist, work hard and stay humble. You wore this outfit before, Babe. Go get changed. After this, guys, Lulu and I are going out. So we'll continue our next Q&amp;A… on the next session! Say bye for now. Say bye. Cheeks! Your cheeks! Goodness! Bye bye! Hi, guys. I'm Lulu. George's ex. Bye! It's a prank! Okay, guys, see you again next time. On the next Q&amp;A. Peace out! Babe! - Congratulations. - Thank you, Ma'am. Being a woman is not easy. A lot of expectations that burden us. Beauty standards that often make no sense. Beauty is slim. Beauty is white. Yet women are so diverse. When this company was established... Mrs. Melinda chose the name Malathi not without a reason. Malathi is a Sanskrit word. It means "a good friend". And that's what we aspire to be for Indonesian females. A good friend. Who doesn't judge. A good friend. Who doesn't corner you. And a good friend. Who helps us know who we really are. And here they are. The new faces of Malathi. That's my picture! Yeah, Rara! That one's adorable. LISTEN TO YOUR HEART DEFINE YOUR BEAUTY They're all so delicious. Perfect. - I'm speechless. - Ra. You're awesome, Ra. This time I'm serious. Congratulations. Thanks. Okay, I need to go over there. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Wow, Ms. Manager. - What's with you? - So awesome! When you were up there giving your speech I was so moved, I almost shed a tear. I'll be embarrassed if I cry in public. My son is awesome. You take great pictures. The important thing is our debt is paid off. - Thank you, Son. - You're welcome, Mother. Hey, take my picture like this. Make it huge. Yeah? Yeah, I'll print you one. Really? Promise? I promise. I'll make it as big as a wall, okay? What did I told you? Open your bangs, you look pretty. Yeah, Mar. Now that I see it, my mole is cute, huh? Yeah. I want to add one. Right here. Make it a twin. Check it out. My picture... if you look at it, I look like a celebrity, huh? A celebrity? Who? - Adul. - Adul? Right! Congratulations. Thank you, it's okay! Thank you! But Net... look at mine. Turns out that my teeth are not that curly, huh? Not really. More like a perm. - Wavy. - Right! It's a trend in my salon. Oh! Hey, Maria! You look so pretty in your picture. Ah Endah, you're prettier. No, you're prettier. No, Endah, you are! You are! Smarty pants! I know you're the smartest, but really, you're prettier! You're prettier! So your compliments just pass me by? Nobody's calling me pretty? Fine, you're pretty too, Prit. - You're pretty. - Hey, Neti! What are you doing? Come here! Can I take this picture? I want to put this in my salon. Girl, you're embarrassing us! Hi! Hello, Ms. Rara! Ra. Dika's Rara is so awesome. Aw! Ah! Ah! Control yourself. This is rich people's event, Fool! Happy? I'm happy. Lin, did you make these? Yes, Mom. I like to slice stuffs. Nice slices. "Rise again with bold breakthrough." Thanks to the photographer. Rendang, Auntie. Wow, this is what I want. I hope everybody likes it. - Everybody? - Well, yeah. I thought this is for me. - Oh! - Why should I share? Remember your thighs, Mom. Leave me out of this! So that's how it feels being ridiculed. Dik, Mr. Kelvin wants to meet you for Malathi's new campaign. What to do? My schedule's so tight, so busy, you know. - Oh yeah! - I think you need a manager. - Am I right? - Great idea. - Auntie? - Huh? Alright. But I charge huge commission. Oh bad idea then, cancel it. Let's go separate ways, Auntie. It's okay. Hi, Sis! Hi! - Hello, Auntie. - Hi, Ra. Rara, why are you fat again? - Are you stressed? - You got fired? - Pregnant? - Sis! Sorry, too spontaneous. I know. You've stopped exercising? - I'm still exercising, Auntie. - Really? But we exercise to get healthy, Auntie. Not to get slim. But you're prettier when you're thin, Ra. Turns out that being pretty doesn't always mean being happy, Auntie. Before, I was afraid to get on the weight scales. Afraid that the numbers shown will make me feel worthless. But now I've learned. That the scale only shows numbers. Not values. I learn to be the best version of myself. Because the truth is, we don't have to be perfect. To be happy. People started to consume wine... since 4.000 years B.C. How come you're so smart? So cool. Aw! - Mr. Kelvin! - Ouch! How is it? Satisfying? Of course, Neti is fabulous! - Thank you, Miss. - Thank you. It's okay! Ma'am, come to my salon? Maybe tomorrow, okay? Waiting for pay day? Ew, penniless! Let's call the septic tank cleaner. Septic tank cleaner! Give it to me! Hello, septic tank cleaner! Please come! I have some shitty friends here! We have floating shit. We have leaning shit. Floating, relax. We have one like this too. What's that? Tai-chi. What is this, Mom? While the shits are gathering... I'll just flush you all.
