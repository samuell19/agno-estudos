RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM That's perfect. Alexa, just have your leg a little bit... a little bit straighter. There you go. That's it. And it's like, it's just a little bit of... That's it. I love the smiles! Gorgeous smiles! That's it. Mom! - Look at my arabesque! - Yes, please. Oh, my goodness. It's the best one I've ever seen you do. You're gonna be amazing in the Christmas Eve recital. Are you sure you're not just saying that because you're my mom? No, I'm saying it because I'm your teacher. I love you 'cause I'm your mom. Dance, dance. When I could still get out there and teach and not need a week of physical therapy after. You're gonna feel so much better after your surgery. I am so sorry to miss the recital! Don't worry. Just worry about getting well. Carrie and I can handle it. I know. I know you can handle anything that comes your way. Are you okay? What? Nothing, nothing. It's all fine. Okay. You're smushing me! No, it's not a mom hug without the smush. Go get your stuff, let's go home. Is Maggie okay? She seems off. I think she's worried about her surgery. Yeah. I wish she could feel like she used to. It's almost Christmas. Make it an official Christmas wish. I think you're confusing Christmas with birthdays. No, it's a thing. Do I need a candle? - Stop overthinking it. - Okay. I wish that Maeryn has a beautiful and happy and healthy year and... And since you're always using your wishes on other people, I'm gonna use my Christmas wish on you. You're Jewish. It's symbolic, and Santa knows I'm a big fan. 'Kay. Dark hair, - blue eyes... - Carrie. ...great sense of humour. And, it's done. Well, you just wasted a wish 'cause that's not what I want. Olivia, it's been eight years since Nathan died. No one should wait that long to find love again. I love my life. I don't need anything or anyone else. And make him very good with kids. Stop! Here you go. Have some cider. Thanks, sis, but does everything we eat and drink have to be holiday themed? Yes, it does. Especially because you came home for Christmas. I came home because I have work here. It just happens to be Christmas. Well, you know we like to make it a big deal, so spirit up. - I will try. - Just make sure that you're here when we decorate the tree tomorrow. Oh, Beth, I can't promise that. I might have meetings tomorrow. Uncle Eddie, come on! You have to be here for the tree! What are you doing up, Connor? I have to practice staying up so I can see Santa. Will you stay? Of course, buddy. Absolutely. Now, come on. Let me tuck you back into bed. - Night! - Night, Mom. - How did you get so heavy? - I don't know. It's Hanukkah. It's early, right? Better than a few years ago when it was on Thanksgiving Day. Now, that was confusing. I'm sorry. I always get you a gift first night of Hanukkah. You don't have to get me anything. But I need to go out, to a place where they may or may not have gifts. Bye. Happy Holidays! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas! Are you all right? Let's go inside, where it's warm. - Thank you. - All right. I'll get the door for you. - I'm Olivia, by the way. - I'm Gertrude. - So, it was $80 total? - Yes. I saved all year with the bank's Christmas Club. It was for my... my grandkids' gifts. And now it's gone. I'm gonna go out and look for it. I will help you. - Okay? - Okay. - Let's do that. - You stay right here. Well, thank you. Who are we kidding? Those twenties gotta be long gone by now. I know. So, what should we go? Well... I've got two twenties? That's really thoughtful. Okay, that's funny. I have two too. Should we really do this? I mean, maybe it's a scam. You mean that little old lady was lying in wait to scatter her fake money into the wind on the off-chance that two random people would give her their money to help her? Maybe. I mean, even master criminals have to get old. I'm Edward, by the way. Olivia. - Nice to meet you. - You too. Okay. - So... - Should we do this? - I think we should. - Okay. Let's go. Yeah. Gertrude, you're never gonna believe this. We found all of your money. All $80, there it is. Ooh! What? You Did? How? It was pretty darn amazing. You know what? Listen, you tell it. I think you should tell her. You're gonna tell the story so much better than me. Oh, no. He's amazing at it. He is. It's really important. I think that you should tell it. I think you should. Fine. I mean, it's... it's so good. So, what happened was the bills went up in... in the wind. Yes. Yes, and then they blew and apparently they blew really hard and... and... and they went right into a... Christmas tree! Straight into a tree. You saw the trees. They're all over the place outside. Yeah, so when we went out, we looked and there was this Christmas tree and it had $20 bills. Like little green ornaments, right there in the tree. That's... Unbelievable. Isn't it? I guess. I guess we really all just got lucky. Luck has nothing to do with it. It's Christmas. It's a magical time of year. Yeah, like my credit card magically getting maxed out every year. You're so funny! He's got a sense of humour. But think about it. Would you two have ever met if you didn't come together to help a little old lady? Now, that's... ...magic. Or... fate. Call it what you will. Excuse me. I, I've gotta get back to work. I just wanna make sure you're all set, Gertrude. I am. Thank you so much, both of you, for everything. - Merry Christmas to you. - Merry Christmas! Thank you. - And Merry Christmas to you! - Okay. Have a good one. Okay. - Christmas tree. - Yeah. Really. - That was good. - Was it? How did it stick? Sap, obviously. I thought maybe like, the wind just blew it and it just stuck on one of the needles. But then the needles woulda had to be sticking straight out. Yeah, but the wind blew from the side, I mean... I'm just glad that we were able to help her out. - It felt really good! - Yeah. Yeah. I should get going to where I was going before all of this. - Yeah. Same here. - Yeah. - Do you... - Whu... I thought you were gonna say something. No, I thought you were gonna say something. - I didn't see you... - It's totally fine. No... Great. Good. Well, you take care of yourself. Yes. You take care. - Okay. - Okay. Merry Christmas! Here you go, dear. Merry Christmas! I'm so sorry! I'm sorry. - You okay? - Yeah. Okay. - Which was are you goin'? - This way. Couple blocks. Me too. Wanna walk along with me? - Sure. - Okay. I wonder what Gertrude ended up getting her grandkids. - If she even has grandkids. - Oh, stop it. I'm just kidding! Maybe. Oh, come on. It was kinda weird how she went on and on about fate, though, wasn't it? You don't believe in fate? Well, no. Don't worry. Neither do I. If you believe in fate, it's like saying that you're not in control of your own destiny. - Exactly! - Yeah! Don't even get me started with the whole Christmas magic thing. Oh, no, I totally believe in Christmas magic. - You do? - Yeah! I'm just not a big Christmas guy. Why not? Well, my parents were divorced and the holidays were just always strained. I'm sorry. No, I am. Christmas shouldn't be like that. Why did I just tell you that? Because, I'm a complete stranger and you're never gonna see me again, so it's safe. You're probably right, actually. Are you gonna fix every tree? 'Cause there's like ten more. I might. I like to help. So let me guess, you're a decorator? - No. - Social worker. - No. - Therapist? No! No? Dance teacher. That was my next guess. Right. I will say, you have a certain grace about you. Thank you. I mean, for some people, dance is therapy. So maybe you weren't so far off the mark. You're not gonna make me do a therapeutic dance or somethin', are ya? I might. Is this on your way to work? It can be. Me too. I didn't realize they started the Christmas Festival again. It's the best! Oh, man. I have not been here in a long time. I do vaguely remember my parents standing right over there having a big fight about a bag of roasted pecans. That doesn't sound like fun. Yeah, well... it was a long time ago. So, you live in New York? Well, I... it's more of a home base, really. I travel a lot so I don't technically live anywhere, really. What? You all right? Look up. What? The snow? So beautiful. You're not from around here, are ya? Actually, I've lived here my entire adult life. - Really? - Yeah. You're so enchanted by this snow! I'll never get tired of snow at Christmas. What about snow in April? No, that's the worst. Hey. Do you want some pecans? No. No, thank you. I've kinda got a thing about pecans. Since that day, I haven't had any. Really? We should change that. Pecans are delicious. - Let's... - I don't... - Yeah. - Okay. May I have two, please? Well, no, no. I'll pay for it. Except I can't pay for it because I gave all my money to Gertrude. Yes. Me too. I'm so sorry. There was this little old lady and she had her Christmas savings and then this crazy wind came up and all the bills flew away... Yeah, and then we gave her our money and we told her it was her money that we found outside in a... - Christmas tree. - Which makes zero sense. But it worked, kind of. Know what, guys? The nuts are on me. Thank you. Thanks! Because our story was so good? No. 'Cause I'm a sucker for romance. No, no. No, no, no. - No, we were talking... - I mean, we were... that... Seriously, guys. You guys have yourselves a merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Thank you. When was the last time you were on a swing? Probably the same day I last ate a pecan. It's safe? Maybe we should chance it. Okay. All right. No, wait... No! It's got us. It totally has us! I know! Surprisingly good. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Hey, Lizzie! - Hi! - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas. That is one of my students. Who will ask me, why I was on a swing in the middle of the day. Well, you just gotta tell her that sometimes adults need recess too. What kind of dance do you teach? All kinds, but... I have a soft spot for classical. I used to dance with the City Ballet. Really? That's an incredible accomplishment. Yeah. Thank you. It was, a lifetime ago, and... things change and I needed something with more stability, more long-term. Okay. Well, what do you prefer? Do you prefer teaching or do you prefer performing? No one's ever asked me that. Teaching, absolutely. There's nothing like helping kids reach their goals. That's kinda how I feel about my clients, too. I know you're very busy but what do you do? I'm a consultant. I... I help people open their businesses. Cool. How? Well, basically, I give them the tools that they need to succeed. And they take those tools and they succeed. And I have to say, every time I help someone, I feel... That you made a difference? Exactly. I have to get back to teaching. Yeah, I'd better get to my meeting, too. It was lovely to meet you, Edward. The pleasure was all mine, yeah. Happy Hanukkah. You didn't have to! I love it! Thank you so much. It's from the boutique next door. I saw you lookin' at it. Wait, if you only went next door, where have you been this whole time? Well, that's a long story. Is Maggie here? She's in her office. Hey. Are you okay? No, I'm fine. I wanted you to be the first to know. I have decided to retire and close the studio. I'm... I'm sorry, what? It's time. I mean, it's... it's past time, really. Well... Maggie, you don't have to close the whole thing. You can bring someone in to run the financial part of it and I'll continue to manage the creative part. I'm selling the property, Olivia. When? It's going on the market in a couple of days. December 13th. The kids... you'll have to notify the kids. I'm gonna send the parents an email so they can find a new studio. And... me? And... and... Carrie? Carrie can find an administrative job anywhere and every studio in the city would kill to hire you. I mean, no one's gonna let me come in and design the curriculum like I have here. I mean, we've... we've built something really special in the past eight years and... That was mostly thanks to you. - No. - Yeah. You poured your heart into dance when things were tough, and I know you can do it again. It's two weeks until Christmas. I know. But this is the best time to sell. With the surgery coming up, I don't wanna miss my chance. And maybe this is a chance for you too. I promise, you're gonna be okay. Are you free? - Yeah, hop in. - Thanks. Keep the change. It was a $10 ride. That's found money. That 20 practically flew into my hands just on 7th Avenue. Merry Christmas. Thanks. Merry Christmas. Olivia? Well, Maeryn was already asleep. Yeah, she seemed really tuckered out. Yeah, it was a... it was a long day. So... you wanna talk about it? I do, but I can't. I mean, I can but I... I don't know. Well, I've got all the fixins for my family's egg nog. I love how you say "fixins" like you're from the South. Well, I am. I'm from the south part of Minnesota. - Okay. - Okay. And... ta-da! Ta-da! You like? They're really cute, Mom! Little scarves! Here you are, my sweetheart. - Thank you. - You're welcome. My favourite Christmas tradition ever. Okay. So... tell me what happened today. Okay. It started out great. There was this little old lady and she lost her Christmas Club money, like, it actually blew away. And so I, I helped. Well, I mean... Edward and I helped. Well now, that's wonderful. I'm really proud of you! It was really just 40 bucks. Oh, no. I'm proud of you for speaking to a man long enough to actually get his name? So funny. So, okay! Tell me everything about him. Go on! Mom, there's nothing to tell. We walked, and we talked and then we... went on our way. And you exchanged numbers? No, there's no point. He doesn't live here and I have more important things to think about. No, sweetheart. This is important. Miss Maggie's retiring. Well, okay. Well, that's... you know, that's good for her. Absolutely. I mean, so, so great for her, right? But not great, for me. Because when she retires she's planning on closing the studio which means that I'll be out of a job. Liv, I'm so sorry to hear that, but I'm not the least bit worried. You know, the entire dance community loves you and when you are ready... you're gonna find a new home. I don't want new. I want things to stay the same. I know, but maybe, you know, just maybe... this is gonna be good for you. Well, that's what Maggie said to me. Do you know what's good for me? Because I do. It's egg nog. You'll be fine, Liv. You always are. Thank you. Well, I think that just about does it. - Whoa! That's impressive. - Looks good. Guys! Green bean casserole's ready! Oh, man! That smells exactly the same as the one Mom used to make every year. That's because I kept her recipe. After all these years? Yeah, some memories are worth holding onto. I would've made a pecan pie too but I know you have a thing about that. Actually, not anymore. Okay. Come and eat! Can we eat over here, please? Yeah, we're building Connorberg. Connorborough! Forgive me. You can have one of these of your own, you know. All you have to do is stay put long enough to have an actual relationship. Been there, done that. I'm good. Are you, though? Yeah, I got everything I need right here. Except for maybe a green 4x2. - You got one of those? - Right here. See, of course you do. Thanks, buddy. Mom! It snowed! It did. What should we do? Okay. I was at Evergreen Park yesterday and they were setting up for the Christmas Festival so, let's go there! Maybe we'll run into some friends. - Let's go! - Okay. Merry Christmas. Mom, can I go play in the snow? Have fun. Connor, go play. Don't hit anyone in the face. It's not a video game. I know, I know! He's lovin' it! Hi! Hi. Do you two know each other? Yeah, this is the woman who helped me with Gertrude yesterday. - Olivia. - Yes. - You're Olivia. - I am. This is Olivia! Hi. Sorry, didn't catch your name? I'm sorry. This is, this is my sister Beth... - Hi. - ...and her husband Matt, and my nephew is out there building an ice laser or something like that. I'm staying with them while I'm in town, so. Did you guys make plans to get together? No. This is a coincidence. Well, there's no such thing as a coincidence. Yes, there is. Otherwise they wouldn't have invented the word. Okay, well what are the odds you guys run into each other again? Yeah. Yeah, it's actually the third time, sort of. I saw you in a cab yesterday. Pulled off before I got a chance to say hi, so... Hi. Again. Hi. Again, again. Hey, Matt? Matt? - Yeah. - I'm gonna go look at something for sale over here. Do you wanna come with me? No, I'm good. Thanks. Matt? Actually, you know what? I'm gonna come with you. I'm in the market for a, a picture of Santa Claus. Great, yep. Yeah. Hey, Jimmy! How's it goin'? Christmas punch? Hey! How are ya? You know, I've never randomly bumped into the same person so many times. It's pretty incredible. I mean, you do have family here, so maybe it's not that crazy. - Right. - Yeah. It's probably not fate, just statistics. Right. Excuse me. I'm sorry. I really gotta take this. Of course. You're so important. Greg. Hi. No, I knew you'd be delayed with all the snow. Absolutely, we can see the property whenever you get here. Bye. Hey, Maeryn! Your snowman is awesome. Thanks, Mom! Connor helped. Nice work, Connor! Really well done. Thanks! That's Maeryn. My... my daughter. You're... married. Widowed, actually. I'm so sorry. It was a long time ago. Maeryn was just a baby, and we're okay. Mom, they're doing a huge Christmas mural on Camden Street! They said kids can help. Can we go? Yes. That would be great. Hey, Maeryn, I want you to meet my friend Edward. Edward, this is my daughter Maeryn. Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Maeryn. You have a very beautiful name. Thanks, except I have to spell it for everyone. Well, some day you're going to appreciate having an interesting name. Take it from a guy named "Ed". Ready to go? Yes. Thank you. It was nice to meet you... again. - Bye, Maeryn. - Hey. So, what happened? Nothin'. Just... They just left to go to Camden Street to work on a Christmas mural, that's all. Connor would love that. And Camden Street is so gorgeous right now. All the shops put up their Christmas decorations. Come on, let's go! Edward, you're coming, right? I don't think it's a good idea. What's the problem? I mean, I'm leaving for New York soon and I don't get the feeling that Olivia's really up for dating any time soon, so there's just... there's just no point. There is always a point, Edward. Maybe this is fate telling you to just slow down. I don't know, maybe make a home somewhere other than your one-bedroom apartment in New York City that you never set foot in. I tried that with Hannah, remember? That didn't exactly go very well. Just like Mom and Dad. Around Christmastime it all got that much more intense, so just... That is why I make Christmas extra special for my family, to undo all that. You can too. Come on. Come on. - Yeah? - You're good. - Come on. - All right. Come on! Just a little further. - I almost had it. - You can do it. I really do. Thank you so much! You again! And again and... again. - Yep. Yep. - Yeah. And yep. - Okay! - Okay. - There we go. - Hey, guys. Mind if we join? - Hey. - Of course! Fine! Go on. So... - What are you doin'? - I'm... I'm trying to find the one that goes right in here. I wanna finish this little... Yeah, see that's not how it works. You have to pick one randomly and then you throw it up there and all of a sudden it comes together. Yeah. I love when that happens. You trying to get up there? Lemme help you. Right... there. - Nice! Okay. - Okay. - So just random? - Just random. - Well then, there you go. - Yeah. Ooh! - Yeah. - I-13. Hey, it works. How 'bout that? I-22. That one... no, that's good, that's good! We did it! High five. - That was amazing! - Good work, good work. What do you think it's gonna all become? I don't know. Guess we'll just have to wait and see. Mom, can we go can we go to Baked Expectations and get one of the Christmas Cocoas? Can we go too? How 'bout we all go together? Sure. - Great! - Sounds good. Okay. After you. I am gonna get some Christmas cookies. - Sure. - Okay. So, Olivia, Ed says that you own your own dance studio. No. I just work at one. Miss Maggie's, actually. Down the street. And, not for long. The owner just told us that, she's retiring. I'm so sorry to hear that. Thank you. It's all right. As long as the kids can have their Christmas recital, I'll be okay. I know you're gonna pull it off. And how do you know that? Because when somebody cares about something as much as you do, they make it happen. What a lovely thing to say. Okay, I've got some hot chocolate for you guys. - Thank you. - Yes! - Whoa! - This was a huge mistake. Yeah. Thank you. I don't even know where to start! First eat half the whipped cream. Okay. Then? Then sip an inch of the cocoa out. Okay. What happens after that? Then stir the rest of the whipped cream into the cocoa. All right. Interesting choice. There. Is that what that's for? I mean, maybe. Now all you have to do is let it cool for a minute. Just be cool. Sit back and be cool? Got that. Okay. I look cool? You know, you've got a future in hot cocoa tech support. I appreciate that. Thank you. You're welcome! I think you missed a spot. - Did I? - Yeah. Feels like I got it. - All the way up there? - Yup. Hey, we should head back to the festival soon because I think Santa's gonna be there. Yay! All right, so let's get these to go and we'll all head over. I'll go get some to-go cups and maybe a couple more napkins. Yeah. Mom, can I go see Santa? Yes, of course! Go stand in line. Connor? More sugar. - Here, lemme help. - Thank you. - There we go. - Thank you. You're welcome. I bet the kids love taking your classes. What makes you say that? I don't know. You just have a way of making everything seem fun. Well, so do you. I mean, the cocoa. Usually Connor is the only one who sees me get that goofy. It's not goofy. It's, sweet. What? I wonder what Gertrude would say if she saw us sitting here right now. "I told you so"? Oh boy. - Okay. - Sorry. It's okay. Everything okay? Yeah, everything's fine. I just... I've been putting off work all morning and I probably should get to it. Definitely. Look, Maeryn's almost to the front of the line. Hey! Do you think it'd be all right if I gave you my phone number? To... you know, in case you wanted to call and have Maeryn and Connor spend some time together? They would love that. Great. Okay. Do you... Yeah, I have a pen. Great. Here. Okay. There we go. Hope you can read this. Is that okay? Edward. Awesome! I... guess I'll talk to you later. - Okay. - Okay. Ho, ho, ho! - I'll see what I can do. - Thank you. Are you ready? Okay. - Hey, come here. - Good job! And what would you like for Christmas, young lady? More days like this. That's a good wish. And how 'bout you? Oh, no, I'm... I'm too old. You're never too old for a Christmas wish. Just close your eyes and make it. I'll hear you. Done. I loved your wish. I thought your wish was... was beautiful. - What should we do? - Games. Games? Let's do games. Let's go this way. Bye, guys. Okay. - Did you have fun? - Yeah. Me too. And... what was your favourite part? Santa. I loved your wish. That made me really happy. I also loved all of the designs, like everybody's stuff, and, I loved the... the crafts and I think I'm gonna go back and get some Christmas presents. What do you want for dinner? Spaghetti! - I got it, I got it! - No, it's okay. - I got it! - No, no! I got it, please. It's okay, I got it. Okay, I'll trade ya. Trade ya. It's been three days. I don't understand. Why hasn't she called? Probably because she realizes that going out with a human tumbleweed is a colossal waste of time. Romance... Romance is never a waste of time. Why don't you just call her? - I don't have her number. - Why not? Because I wanted it to be her decision. I was trying to be a gentleman. She told me the name of her dance studio! What is it?! I don't remember! Seriously, Beth? I'm sorry. There was so much going on. Let me just do an internet search. Just a sec. Olivia dance studio Minneapolis. You know what? No, Beth, don't. Don't. This should be Olivia's decision to make. Really, just... Hey, Greg. Yep. Yep. I'll be right there. Do you think Connor would like that? Because it's really annoying. Just like his uncle. And touch and turn, and light on your feet, And smiles on your faces and touch and turn. That's it, that's so good! Touch... ooh, I like that leap! That was kinda nice. Maybe we'll put that in! Here are the programmes. Okay. They're great. They're really great. Well done. I just don't understand why he hasn't called you. I didn't give him my phone number. What is wrong with you? What is wrong with me? It's nine days until Christmas and our careers are in limbo and I can't find that jewelry box, the one that Maeryn wanted, so, if you'll stay here, I'm gonna run to the toy store on Grand and see if they have it. - But... - Thank you. I'm not gonna talk about Edward. Do you see how I'm not talkin' about it? Not gonna. And touch and turn, and touch and twirl and... Touch and twirl! Beautiful, ladies. Is it really this much? Yeah. I'm sorry, Ma'am. We have a law-away program if you want. I only have so much saved. I'll find something else. Would another $20 help? - That's not necessary. - I insist. I found it right on 7th Avenue the other day. I was waiting for the right moment to pass it on. I think this is it. Are you sure? I'm positive. Merry Christmas. Same to you. You have no idea how much this means to me. Thank you. You made my Christmas. You know what's crazy? I know where that $20 came from. It's so funny, so do I! Beth! Olivia! I'm so happy to run into you! - Why? - Because now I can find out why you haven't called Edward back. I'm sorry. That's too pushy. Don't answer that. Could you answer that? Yes. I wanted to call him. I lost his number. Well, then, here you go. And while I'm at it, can I have yours too? I'm sorry, that's too pushy! - I'm sorry! - No. Warranted. Yes, please. Do you think it was one of Gertrude's? I kinda do. That would make all of this... Meant to be? It's just not right. Okay. Well, I got another one to show ya a few blocks away. I think this one is gonna have everything that you're looking for. Then let's go. We're running out of time, Ed. You know I need to find somethin' before the end of the fiscal year. I know. I haven't failed a client yet and I'm not about to start now. She's just down the street. "She" who? I'll explain later. Can I just have five minutes? I'm gonna grab something to eat. Okay. And twirl, and twirl. All right, everybody. Arms up. And hope back over here. And arms up. Ar... - Carrie, can you take over? - Sure. Come over here, girls! - Hi. - Hi. I lost your number. I mean, I really actually lost your number and... I ran into Beth and I... I know. She just texted me. And... and... as soon as I figured out where to find you, I just... I didn't wanna take any chances, so. Did she tell you about the $20? I mean, it's crazy. I mean, it's completely crazy. It's Gertrude's 20. I mean, it had to be. And it just keeps showing up! Unless it's what Gertrude said, just a little bit of Christmas magic. I thought you didn't believe in Christmas magic. Well, I'm getting there. Yeah? Maeryn had a... a great time. She was so happy. So did Connor. He really did. We should make plans to get together again! You... so the kids can... Why didn't you show me this space? What? The guy next door says it's on the market as of this morning. It's perfect! Let's make a move before anyone else gets down here! Hey, how ya doin'? Hi. Good thing he made this stop. I think we should put in an all cash offer and get this thing done in a week. I'm gonna call the bank, get the funds ready! Who was that? That was my client. And he wants to buy the studio today? I am just as surprised about this as you are, Olivia. Well, you're his advisor, right? Can't you advise him not to do it? No, I can't. Why not? Because for everything that Greg's got going on, this space is absolutely perfect! It's way better than any space that we've seen so far, and I really wouldn't be doing my job if I just let it go. Can we at least have, the Christmas Eve recital here? I don't know, but I'll try. I... I will make something happen. Why did he even come here? 'Cause he was standing right there when I got the text from Beth and then when she said that one of Gertrude's 20s showed up again I just... I took that as a sign that I had to see you. I... ..thought maybe it was fate. Yeah. I thought so too. Just for a second. Maybe all that $10 has done is make things worse. I need some air. Excuse me. Olivia, wait. Olivia, please. Please, please, please, wait. I'm so sorry that it's happening like this. Not sorry enough to stop them. I'm really not the bad guy here. I mean, your boss is selling the property no matter what, and if Greg doesn't buy it then somebody else will, just as fast. You know that. I know. I just wasn't ready. And the recital. Well, I'll talk to Greg and maybe you can still use the space for the recital. Well, that'd be great. You know, this is your chance. A chance! For what? To start at the bottom at a new studio? No, this is your chance to start your own studio. No. I'm a... I'm a teacher. I'm not a businesswoman. I wouldn't know where to start. But this is what I do. I help people like you. And I know a good bet when I see one. Please, I'd love to make this up to you. Let me help you with this. You're just offering because you feel bad. Yes, I am. I'm not gonna let you fail on this. And who knows? Maybe your boss isn't even gonna accept the first offer anyway. She accepted the offer! What? So quickly? Come on! Really? Kidding me right now? Okay. I'm gonna go inside. Hold on, Olivia, wait. Beth invited me to the Christmas Tree Festival tree lighting tonight and I won't go if you don't wanna see me. Or if I do go and you do see me, then... you can ignore me. How do you even know I'm going? Because you love Christmas. True. Okay. Ignore you later. Is Edward coming? No idea. Doesn't matter to me whether he's here or not. Okay. Hello! Hey. Edward! Is Connor here? Yes, he sure is. He's back by the apple cider booth. - Wanna come see him? - Yeah. Come on! Hello, again. Again, again, again, and again? It's one too many. - Is it? - Yeah. I thought you were gonna ignore me. Oh no, I am! I'm starting right now. All right. You know, I don't believe we've met. I'm Barb, Olivia's mom. You are? I'm Edward Taylor. And it's such a pleasure to meet you. This... is Edward? You didn't tell me he was so handsome. Really? 'Cause usually that's the first thing people say. Okay, Mom. Remember? I'm upset with Edward and we're not talking to him. Well, like I told you before, he doesn't owe you anything. It was his job to take care of his clients. Whose side are you on? Yours, sweetheart, forever. Barb, thank you very much. You're a smart woman. Good evening, everyone! I am Mayor Parker and welcome to the 45th annual Evergreen Park Christmas Festival Tree Lighting! And my Christmas gift to you all is me not giving a long speech. How 'bout we get all the kids up here for the countdown? Mom, can I go too? Well, aren't we gonna hold hands like our thing? I'll hold your hand for the rest of the night. Please? It's okay. Have the most wonderful time. - She's growing up. - I know. Pretty soon she's not gonna wanna hold my hand at all. And then some day, she will again. I'm gonna go find Carol. I'll see you a bit later. - Aw. Love you, Mom. - Love you too, sweetie. Okay, here we go! Five, four, three, two, one! Mom, come on! All the stores on Camden are lighting up too! Well we have to go see them! You're comin' too, right? If it's all right? Well, I think Connor would be really disappointed if you weren't there. Connor, wait! - That is adorable. - So cute. - Almost done. - Man, it's comin' together. It really is! Hey. Any idea how long this space has been vacant? A couple of months maybe. Why? It would be perfect for your studio! I... I... I can't rent property, Edward. I don't have that kind of money. Olivia, if anybody can get a small business loan, it's you. Trust me on that. Just... picture it for a second! What if that's why Greg was meant to buy the old studio, so that you could have this incredible chance? And maybe that's why I was right there when it all happened, when you made the best decision of your life! Man, maybe it really is fate. I don't know anything about the business side of it. But that's what I'm there to help you with. Okay. What if I fail? What if you don't? And you won't! You gotta trust me on this. I know what I'm talking about. So I... I could hire Carrie, and I could hire... a couple other dance teachers with different styles than mine, and... There's so many things that I couldn't do at Miss Maggie's, and I... How long would it take to renovate? A month, tops. You know, when I was just a teacher, I always knew that I would be all right no matter what. This is... - Okay. - Okay. - Follow me for a second. - Sure. Worst case scenario, everything here completely falls apart. That is the worst case scenario. - It won't happen. - Okay. But if it did, you just go back to teaching, which is exactly the same position that you're in now, so... what do you have to lose? Maybe now isn't the time. If not now, then... when? Yeah? How was your day? It was the best day ever, Mom. And it looked like you had fun too. I did. You know I love you more than anything, right? I know, Mommy. I love you too. Sweet dreams. Perfect. Goodnight, goodnight. Goodnight. You ready for lights out? Yeah. Hello? I'm in. Let's see the inside tomorrow. Great! Who is this? I wish we didn't have to take all of this down, it's gonna be so empty for the rehearsal. But there just isn't enough time before New Year's. It will be fine once everyone's in here. I'm just glad the new owner is letting us keep the space for the weekend. I don't know where else we could have done it. Have you heard back from the loan officer? No, Edward says not to worry, but, I'm me. I'm so proud of you, I knew you could do it. Well, I haven't done anything yet. Taking the first step, that's the hardest part. Taking a chance, trying something new. Yeah, it's been a long time since I tried something new. Knock knock! Hi! Hi! Do you have a second? - Yes, I do. I have a second. - Okay, great. - Thank you. - Hi. - It's looking very good. - Thank you. You're welcome. It's good. So did the finance person call? No, not yet, but I'm sure we're gonna hear by tomorrow. Meanwhile, I'm here to meet with the contractor who is going to transform this space into a gallery, so... Once we, remove everything, there should be lots of nail holes, so you could just use them right from there. Wait a minute. It's the contractor. He said he threw his back out shoveling snow, and he wants to push the meeting until tomorrow. It's always the snow with us, isn't it? It is. And obviously I feel horrible about his back, - obviously, but... - Obviously. But it's kind of good news, 'cause I can spend some time brainstorming your project now, because if you want to open in January, you've gotta do a pre-launch. Gotta get the word out there. May I help with the brainstorming? No, I was gonna do it by myself. - Good. - I'm teasing! I thought you had to teach and you were busy, you had to take Maeryn home, all sorts of stuff. Maeryn's with my mom, and the kids won't be here 'til tomorrow night, 'cause that's the big dress rehearsal for the Christmas Eve recital, which starts in five days. I know. Thank you for getting Greg to let us use this space. You're welcome, I know it meant a lot to you. Yeah. So, you wanna... maybe grab a bite? - Yeah... I mean... - Yeah? - Yeah. - I'll wait for you outside. Okay. Where are you going? I'm going for a walk. - A walk? - Yep. - That's it? - Yeah, I love to walk. Okay. See you later. Have fun. So, where to? Let's just start walking. And see where we end up? Exactly. Aw, look at these guys! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Nice. Hey, you hungry? Yeah, but the lines are too long. Hey! Let's go old school! A hot dog? That's not very Christmassy. No, it's not a hot dog. It's Santa's ho-ho-ho dog! You get extra points for marketing. - Thank you. - We'll take a couple, please. - Sure. - Thank you. Every time I look at a 20 bill, I wonder if it's one of Gertrude's. Me too! You know, what's been happening with us, that it's just one big coincidence. I thought so... but I gotta be honest. I kinda like living in a world where fate and magic exist together. I didn't expect that. Me too. You want these hot dogs or what? Thank you. Here you go. You take this, and whatever's left over, just put it towards whoever's next, okay? That's funny. Someone did the same thing a few days ago with a 20 they found over on 7th Avenue. Thanks. So, do you think it was... I really do! I haven't been on one of those since Maeryn was a baby, and then I was too worried if she was too cold, and I don't remember any of it. I mean, none of it. I don't remember any of it either, 'cause I've actually never been on one, so... Really? Let's fix that. Merry Christmas, guys! I can't believe I've been missing out on this all these years. - The holidays? - Everything. Thank you for... for bringing Christmas back to me. You're welcome. Well, I gotta say, this has been the all-time best business meeting I've ever had... And one of the best days I've had in a very long time. Me too. I'm home! Well... Thank you for walking me home. Well, it was on the way to Beth's, so... You have a beautiful home. Well, I love it. It's tiny, but it's charming. And it's walking distance to the new studio. So now I'm just worried about the loan. Don't worry about that at all. Final word comes down tomorrow, okay? You'll be good. All right, I'm gonna go back to Beth's, and I'm gonna get all of Greg's work out of the way, so tomorrow morning we can go full force on the pre-launch plans for the studio. How does that sound? - Awesome. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Thanks for a great night. - Yeah, it was fun! - It was. - Edward! - Hello! Is Connor with you? He's not, actually, he's at home, which is right where I'm headed with a very nice business meeting with your mom. Don't leave! It's Christmas cookie baking night! You can help if you want. I mean, Edward might be... might be busy. So, do you have a... do you have a little time? Actually, there is nowhere I would rather be. Grandma! Look who found the Christmas spirit. - Yeah, don't tell anyone. - I might. - Are you on decorations again? - Yeah. - Awesome. - All right! That's what I'm talking about. Okay. Okay, okay, I switched over the... Edward! Hi, Barb. Well, how nice to see you again. Nice to see you, too. So did Olivia invite you to bake Christmas cookies with us? Technically, it was Maeryn, but Olivia agreed, and as long as it's okay with you... Are you kidding me? Okay, who's gonna do the eggs? Eggs are up. I'll do the eggs. I'll do the eggs. You guys don't mind a little eggshell in your cookies, - do you? - Gross! I'm joking! I save the eggshells for the frosting. Here we go. There's technique to this. Ready for this? Just drop the egg! That was amazing. With some eggshell. Oh, no! Hey, wait for Santa! She's been doing that since she was little. Really? It was shaped weird. It was shaped weird? And look, oh no! Oh, this is terrible. - There's a thing in the icing. - Liv! I don't know if you could even fit more cookie in there, but you know what, truthfully, I gotta make a point. I don't even know what this shape is, so... I'm just gonna help out a little bit here. Well, I guess this one's burned, so... All right, okay. There, I don't need an excuse. I'm old. First of all, no you're not. But you're right, you're allowed. Cheers! Cheers. - Cheers! - Cheers! So this is what Christmas is supposed to be like, huh? I think I like it. Thank you for inviting me to stay tonight. I actually had a really good time. Yeah, it really was. You should have these. You worked so hard. Yes! Have I said thank you for everything you're doing for me? You've done just as much for me. - Goodnight. - Goodnight! Four more days 'til the recital and you all look ready right now! I am so proud of all of you! So... when do you hear about the loan? Today. And I'm so excited about the space on Camden Street. We can do everything that we've always dreamed of... but it all depends on the loan. No, I'm not worried. This is exactly how everything was meant to happen. You deserve this. We deserve this. Hi! Did you see? Olivia, I have some bad news. Okay... For the sale to close, we have to vacate by this weekend. No, we talked to Greg, it's fine to use the space. No, it's the insurers, it's a liability thing. They won't give him coverage if we're here. What? No... Greg... Greg said that it was... I feel terrible, this is not how I wanted everything to end, but we can't have it here. - But we have to have it. - I know. Okay, 'cause the kids depend on it, and the parents. I am going to find another place. Me too, I'm sorry... me too. We'll find a place... Thank you. Olivia! Hey! Carrie told me I could find you here. I'm sorry about losing the recital space. I tried to do a work around, but it's not gonna happen. Thank you. I... what if we used the new space? We can't use it until the loan clears. Okay... I'm going to the bank. You want me to come with you? Nope. Absolutely not. I need to do it on my own. Long story. And like you said, it's important I believe in myself. I know you're anxious to get a decision. Normally, we would get a response with a couple days, but since there are so many people out for the holidays, I just... don't know when we'll hear back. But I am certain you'll get your answer between Christmas and New Year's. Well, I... that would be too late. - Olivia? - Yeah? You just gift-wrapped our salt shaker. Merry Christmas! Sorry, Mom. Okay. Sorry. Still nothing? Nope. At this rate, I think that we're going to be having the recital in the parking lot. You know it will all work out. Where's Edward for all of this? I told him I wanted to do it myself. Well, he clearly believes in you. Or he's just doing all this to make himself feel better. By helping me. You don't actually believe that, do you? Mom, it can't be the other thing. He doesn't live here. It will never work out. So that's it? You're just going to cut yourself off from love before even giving it half a chance? I'm protecting myself. No. You have put up walls for years, Liv... At least... come on, give him a ladder. Tell him how you feel. Give him a reason to stay. Ma... What? Okay, it's from the bank. Okay. What?! - Okay, what?! - I got the loan. - Sweetheart! - I got the loan! Okay, and... And look, no, it says that we can use... we can use the space! We can use the space for the recital! I'm so proud of you! Thank you! Okay! I'm gonna call Edward. - Call him! - I gotta call Edward. Okay. Hello?! Come on in! - Hi! - Hi! I... I got the loan! I know! I came over as soon as I heard! Must have been something I said at the bank. I knew you could do it. Mom... Mom made... Man, she's good. - Egg nog? - Yeah! Cheers. To... new beginnings. To new beginnings. - Yeah. - Yeah. Look at this! It's perfect! I mean, people will be out there, they'll be shopping, and then they'll have some cocoa, and then they'll come in here, and they'll just watch the show! I can't believe this is all mine. Thank you. Well, you're welcome, but you should be thanking yourself because this is all you, you made this happen. Okay... there's so much that I have to do before we can do anything. Like what if the electrics don't pass inspection? And then there's paint, like, I have to choose the colour. Which of course I've chosen the colour, but I have to put it up, and there's lights. Like, I think we need more lights! Olivia... Yeah? You don't have to do any of that alone. I'm gonna be with you. We can do it together. Okay, and you're gonna get it done, and it's gonna look fantastic, and people will come in here, and they'll just see how incredible you are. Everyone will see... Do I see an idea forming right here? Yes... yes. Yes. Okay. So if it goes the way that I think it could go, then we won't have to change the routine. I mean, a little bit, but... but not much. I'm so proud of you. I'm proud of me, too. Just so you know, this is gonna be the best studio in town. I'm so excited. That's it. - That's everything. - Look at this. Okay. I think I'm going to head down to Baked Expectations and get more baked goods for everybody. Then I think I'm gonna go to the bank and get Lynn a treat. As a thank you. Hold down the fort? - Will do. - Great. Thank you! This smells so good. I'll see you at the recital? This too, please. That's great. Keep the change. Merry Christmas. Thank you! Merry Christmas. Olivia! What... what are you doing here? What am I doing here? I... I didn't know that you knew anyone at the bank. Lynn and I just have some mutual friends in the industry. Did you know Lynn before I applied for my loan? I am just gonna give you two a minute. Lynn, I... thank you. These are for you. - Thank you so much. - Thank you! Merry Christmas. We actually met after you applied for the loan. Edward, did you do something to push my loan through? All I did is I put in a very good word for you, and I made it clear that you would be a very good investment. That's it. Are you okay? No, no. I feel like you went behind my back, and I... You let me think that I got my loan on my own. Did you think that I... did you think that I could do it on my own? Of course I did! Of course. I just gave it a little bit of a push so that you'd get through the finish line. I was just trying to help. Well, that's not what I needed. I never wanted to feel as helpless as I did when Nathan died. I had to figure it out all over again. I needed to know that I... that I could do it on my own after you left. I would never leave you hanging like that. You're going to have to leave eventually. Not if I have a reason to stay. Well, I can't be that reason. Not if you don't believe in me. Maybe you're just afraid of what would happen if I did stay. Because you'd have to open your heart again, and maybe that's just a bigger risk than even the studio. I can't think about my heart. Not right now. Okay... Okay. I... I can't believe this is happening right now. I mean, I should have known, because every time I put my emotions into anything like this, it just completely falls apart on me, and... And the fact that it's Christmas right now is perfect. I guess I'll never learn. Edward, I'm so... grateful. Thank you for everything that you have done. I think maybe you were right. I mean, maybe all of this, fate everything, it wasn't about us. It was... it was about the studio. Okay. So if that's the case, then... I guess I'm just going to head out to my next client, and, I wish you good luck on your recital. And I wish you good luck on, everything. Olivia... you're going to be a huge success. Pecan, dear? Gertrude? What are you doing here? Well, my husband works here. Are you okay, dear? You seem upset. I'm fine. You know, I could've sworn I saw you with that nice young man from the toy store yesterday. Is he here? I'd love to say hello. No. He left. But you didn't want him to, did you? No. Did you tell him that? I was scared. Of what? Of being heartbroken. You mean... the way it is right now? This wasn't your Christmas wish, was it? How do you know that? Gertrude, I'm sorry. I have to get back to work. It was... really lovely to see you. Merry Christmas. You too, Olivia. Nothing a little Christmas magic can't fix. Hey, there you are. The recital is going to start in like half an hour. What's going on? Change of plans. I gotta head to Flagstaff tonight. But what about Christmas? I wasn't originally going to stay that long. You know that. I know, but things have changed. What about Olivia? That's not gonna work out. Let me guess. You had a disagreement. - Yep. - You even try to work it out? You know how things go with me. Once there's a fight, that's pretty much it. That's because you haven't found someone to fight for. Until now. Instead of giving up, just try. When it's with the right person, you end up even closer than you were before. Please don't go, Edward. Don't give up on fate. I wish I still thought fate was real. Hey, guys. What, really? Were you even gonna say goodbye to Connor? I was, I was gonna wait for you guys to get back from the recital. Which Ed isn't even going to now. What? Where is Connor? He's helping Olivia's mom hand out programs. And so was I until this lady came up to me and asked me to give you this. You know what it is? No... no idea. "To remember the most romantic business meeting of my life. "Merry Christmas, Edward. Love, Olivia." Who gave this to you? Just some old lady in a red scarf. It's going to be so good. She's doing so well! - Here she is. - Okay. Everything's ready when you are. I am so proud of you, Liv. - Thanks, Mom. - I love you, I love you. I love you. I just wish that it... I know. - Okay. - Here we go. - All right. - Let's do it. Let's do it. Ladies and gentlemen, first performance! Snowflakes and Reindeer! And have fun! She's so happy. It's better than we could have imagined. Bravo, bravo! Wonderful! Oh my, there she is! There she is! You were wonderful. Wonderful. Thanks, Mom! I love it here. Well, this is just the beginning. Maeryn, you were fantastic! Thank you! Mom, can I go get gingerbread cookies - with everyone else? - Of course. Olivia, it was just stunning. Thank you. I wish Edward were here. - I know, sweetie. - Merry Christmas. You came. I couldn't leave without saying thank you for... For this beautiful Christmas present you gave me, which I love, and I love that you put the $20 bill inside, too, because that was... all the sign that I need to stop what I was doing, turn around, and come find you. How did you get the box? Matt said that a little old lady found it, and gave it to him to give to me. Gertrude! No, I just.. I just, I mean, I saw her today at the festival. She... - She knew. - She knew what? My Christmas wish. It was to be with you. That was mine, too. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry about what I said. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I should have realized what it looked like from your eyes, I should have realized what I was doing. Well, I know what you were doing. You were trying to make my dreams come true. - And did they? - Well, that depends. Are you staying? Yeah. After all these years. I'm finally home. What about work? I worked remotely from New York, I can work remotely from here, it's no problem. I still get to do what I love. But now I get to be surrounded by the people that I love. The people that you love? Hey, the mural is done! I'm not even going to say what I'm thinking 'cause it's insane. Yeah, it's completely insane. Yeah. - Oh... okay. - Yeah. Hi! Maeryn, you were so wonderful in the recital. Thanks! Mom, are we gonna see them tomorrow for Christmas? If it's all right with Beth. Yes! Yeah, we would love to see you. There's nothing I would love more. What's that? This is a beautiful ornament... Should I go get it? No, let's let this one go. Yeah, we don't need it anymore. Why don't we go and get us some cocoa? Come on. Merry Christmas, Olivia. Merry Christmas, Edward. RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
