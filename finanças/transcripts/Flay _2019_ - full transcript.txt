They left their old world. Left everything behind in search for a land to call home. But this land does not belong to us. We belong to the land. They called us savages, demonic creatures who must be tamed. They cut off our hair, abolished our language, stripped away our faces, our oneness. Kill the Indian, save the man, they would say. A new suit for every native to be worn at all times, even in death. They captured a medicine man, a powerful shaman from the Hawea Tribe. They chained him, they tortured him, they flayed his face. With his last breath, he placed a curse on those chains. A wicked curse. A curse that spanned through the ages. A curse that sent forth his spirit to act in vengeance upon those who held its chains. I can't think you enough, Billy. Anything else? Oh, that's off limits over there. That's for buyers. It's just. This is your stuff over here. Thank you, Billy. Have you talked to Moon? I'm not there yet. You've had plenty of time. I have to be 100%. You'll never be 100%, trust me. Never stops ringing. Steve. Hey. Yeah, it's a good one. Its a nice piece, I know. 1939 Washman, I think. Yeah. You'll have to string it up and find out. I think she'll be good to go. Okay, well, I guess let me know when you want to come, and I'll make sure it's all out for you and ready to go. You're welcome. Hey, what's up? It's River, I can't get to the phone right now. Just leave me a message. I was gonna make something that you really like for dinner tonight. Call me, please. I need to talk to you. Ow. River? River! Work is a distraction I need. Work is a distraction I need. Ow. What is wrong with me? Focus. What are you doing? I live here. Not according to our records. There was no mention of a sexy... What, sexy what? Listen, sister, you are spreading God knows what over a very sensitive area right now. And I would happily cuff you and take you down... Hey, you know, have some respect, gentlemen. She just lost her mother. Hey, Moon. Will you come with me please? Hey, Bearman, remind me again why you got suspended? Was it when you broke your suspect's collarbone, or was it the two DUIs? Or was it both? It's not worth it. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Control yourself, Officer Forman. I'm sorry, sir, they were just harassing her. You must be Moon. The way you found the body was... Everything about this is very unusual. There is nothing unusual about finding a junky face down, dead. I'm done. River, please. I swear to God, if you touch me again, it'll take everyone in this room to keep me from killing you. Will you please just tell them what they need to know? It'll make things easier. I really need you to keep an eye on her. Absolutely, sir. Detective. What is it? It's probably nothing, but there's something that reminds me of a case from 20 years ago. Just keep an eye on her. Make sure she doesn't go into to the garage. - Yes, sir. - I gotta take this. Forman, when I get a chance, I'm gonna take a look at the files from that old case. Let me know if you need anything. I could look too. Stay on this for now. Yes, sir. I hope you still like it with three sugars. You don't have to do this. Yeah, well, according to Gutierrez, I do. Thanks. Everyone's cleared out for now. I'll let you know if anyone's gonna come by later. Should I call your house line? No, that line's disconnected. Okay. Well, seeing as how I know you won't give me your cell phone number, here's what I'll do. I'll drive up and down with the sirens on, and then I'll use the horn and beep Morse code. You know Morse code, right? Hey, you know I still have that ring that you... 646-555-0470. What's that? It's my cell. That's only for emergencies. That is all you. Is there anything else I can get you before I go? Cleaning lady? Yeah, I'll send mine over. Hey, Moon. It's good to see you. Yo, what the... Nice to meet you too. You are unbelievable. I'm just with my friends. Have some respect for Mom. Whoa, whoa, whoa, you have no right talking about respect. Okay, I'm not getting high with my friends and acting like nothing happened. I'm not high. There is a law from like 1800-something that protects you if you smoke weed within like 24 hours of when somebody dies. I need to talk to you. I'm right here. Alone. My friends can hear what you have to say. Don't act tough around them. I'm not acting. - Maybe you should. - Really? - Yeah. - How? Like an adult. She got you, man. You're not gonna take that, are you? No, he's not. I'm not wasting my time with you. Look, can you please just come out in the hall with me? Don't let her control you. You listen, little girl. You might be the flavor of the week, but if you say one more thing to me, I will kick your teeth in. Oh, damn, is that how they do in New York? I thought you told us she was like a poet or something. I don't know what she is. Well, I'm gonna grab a drink. Anybody want anything? I'll go with you. Yeah, man, me too. All this family time is making me kind of thirsty. Are you coming? Let's give 'em a minute. These are your friends? Oh, I don't know, maybe I didn't have a role model around to help me figure that one out. Oh, this isn't about us. Nothing is! Come with me. - Where? - Out there. You can't, that's a crime scene, man. No crime occurred there. All death is a crime, think about that. So deep. Come on, let's go see it. No, why? It just happened, and we knew her. And I wanna see, come on. I'm okay here. The two of you suck. Your problem is you think everything was bad when you were still here. It was Candyland! Every day I came home expecting to find her dead! I'm sorry you had to find her. Who else would have? Didn't you ever think about that? Look, all I'm asking is that you help me clean the house so that it can be ready for the wake. After that, I won't expect anything else. Everything's garbage, just push it to the curb. That's fine. I still need you to help me do it. I've got driver's ed, are you coming? I'll drive. Hector and Chrissie need a ride too. I'll drop them first. Let's go. River, please. She's so lame. Come on. Come on, pick up the phone. I figured you didn't eat. No, I... It's not much, it's just rice and black beans. My famous tortillas. Okay, okay, okay, it's just a little food. People start crying after they eat my beans. Usually they're fightin' for their lives, sittin' on the toilet. It smells incredible. That was your mom's favorite. I can see why. Thank you, I'll make it up to you. Your being here is enough. Listen, she was clean. I don't think so. I mean, maybe she was trying, but not the way they found her. She was trying. Done. When's the wake? Tomorrow. I just want to get it out of the way. I figured so. I can't make it. I got some buyers in Amarillo, and I'll be gone for about three days. But when I come back, you, and me, and River, we're gonna go out. It might just be me and you. He hates you now, but he'll do what I say. At least he respects someone. Respect, he just knows I could kick his ass. Don't worry about him, he'll come around. It's actually harder for him. Thank you. I love you, kid. You call me if anything comes up. Everything's gonna be fine. Now that you're here. This is ridiculous. It's not you. I don't get why she thinks she can come home. You're not the only one whose mom just died. How could you even... I know she's a bitch, but she's going through the exact same thing you are. But. You got a class. In five minutes. Do me a favor? What? Hold my bag. I've got something in there I don't want anyone to see. You included. Thank you. Try to learn something. Yeah, right. Come on, where are you? Whatever. Once I saw the truck jackknife, I realized I had two seconds to decide what I was gonna do. So I hit that black ice, went into an insane 720 spin, narrowly avoiding being splattered by that truck. But that truck driver wasn't as fortunate. He snapped his neck right when he hit that divider. Any questions? Miss Wright, am I interrupting your work? No, I heard everything you said. And what was that? That you were a stunt driver or cab driver or something like that. You better clean up your attitude, or you will be repeating this class. And I am the only one who teaches it. You can't do that. There's no test. All we need are the hours, and we don't sign in with you. So tell me, how could I possibly repeat this? This is mine. You can't take that. My room, my rules. And I say you can't have this thing in here. Douchebag. Quiet! What was that, Miss Wright? River. River, hey, wake up. What'd you take? - Huh? - What'd you take? Nothing. You can be honest with me about what drugs you're taking. I didn't. Then why were you passed out on the floor? I think it might've been the paint fumes. Is this yours? Yeah. It sucks. It just. I don't know. It just came to me. It really sucks. It's good. I'll show you something good. Hurry, come on. Come on. - Why? - Shh. Hey! Hey, hey, I saw you two! Stop right now or you'll spend the rest of your day on in-school suspension tomorrow. Come on, guys. I know you went down here. The building's about to get locked up. I know you're in here. Hello? Hello, hello? If you guys are in here, give yourselves up now. Come on. Okay, open your eyes. Great magic trick. After you, sir. What are we doing here? Get inside. Have a seat. No, stupid, there. So you're still not gonna tell me why we're here? Winning a bet. Okay, that doesn't tell me anything. Put that on. Here, really? You're the boss. I heard you two come down here. Look, if you come out now, I won't report it. You just gotta go home. I heard you two laughing. Look, I swear, if you two jump out on me and give me a heart attack, I have no choice but to kill you. Cut it out, guys. What the hell? Look. I don't know who you are, but you shouldn't be down here. And the building's about to close, so you should... Are you hurt? Sweetie, it's all right. Really, everything's gonna be okay. Just come with me. Please let me help you. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. What was that? The voices in your head. Can we get out of here? Sure, but first that thing I gave you. I'm gonna need it back. What thing? You can't be serious. It's all yours. Where did I put it? River? River, are you? God. Ugh, what is that smell? Weird. Oh God. Oh, I can't believe I'm doing this. I will deal with you later. Do you have a warrant? Yeah, hold on. Look, it's serious. I tried calling. I turned my phone off, and then I lost it. Oh, I'm so, so happy you gave me your phone number. Hey, I'm actually really glad that you're here though. Really? Yeah, I need you to help me clean a mouse out of the workshop. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No, nope. What do you mean no? That's not in my job description. Pretty, pretty please. I can't. I have a mouse thing. But you're paid to carry a gun. Yeah, that's unrelated. Look, it's just a mouse. It's already dead. And it's going to remain dead wherever you found it. Well, I know who not to call when I'm in danger. You don't even keep your phone on you anyway. Look, I need to speak to River. - Is everything okay? - I'm sorry. I need to speak to him. He's in his room, come on. In his room, was it? You two dating again? Where the hell have you been? I was robbing a jewelry store. - River. - Moon. River, it's... Do you love the sound of my name? You're just like Mom, always saying my name. Why weren't you here? I could ask you the same thing. I'm talking about right now. It's, what time is it? It's 1:15. That's way too late to be out. I have no curfew. Had no curfew. What, you're staying? If that's what it takes. If that's what it takes for what, me having a curfew? Hey, I hate to interrupt this family reunion, but I really need to ask him about his whereabouts earlier tonight. Ask away. Have a seat. I'm good here. Have a seat. Have a seat. Where were you at 6:45 tonight? School. Specifically. The locker room. More specifically. What's going on? Moon, please. You know, there's cameras in the hallway, so I suggest you don't lie. I was in the boys' locker room. Look, it was stupid, but whatever. I didn't do anything. When was the last time you saw Mr. Hamilton? I didn't. No? No, not really. I heard him because he was chasing after us, but he didn't catch us. He... He almost caught us in the boys' locker room, but he didn't. So I guess I technically saw him about five minutes after he dismissed driver's ed. What were you doing in the boys' locker room? Changing into my gym uniform. Answer him. I was having sex with my girlfriend in the gym teacher's office. If you need proof that I was there, check the file cabinet next to the door. Top drawer, behind the folders. It was a stupid bet Bethany made with some girl. What'd you leave there? Something that would prove I was there. I don't know if you can test semen for time of ejaculation, but I'd say it was around seven or so. What'd you do afterwards? Went to Hector's house. Hector Solanos. No, immediately after you left the locker room. You checked the cameras. Look, officer, my little offense of mine may be punishable within the warped context of school, but I don't think you need to involve yourself. Mr. Hamilton was found dead in the girls' locker room around 7:30 tonight, face down in the shower, similar to how your mother was found. You think I killed him? I hope it's just a coincidence. I didn't kill anybody. I have to ask these questions. I have no reason to kill anybody. Something is going on. Feels that way, but I'm not so sure. I need you to just lay low for the next couple of days. Does this mean I can cut school? Yeah, but you didn't hear that from me. We have the wake here tomorrow. I know, I'm gonna clean. You should help her. It's not my mess. Hey, River. Look, you gotta watch out. You don't want people to get the wrong impression about you. This? All this for that organic food project for health class. She did not believe you. I swear to God she did, man. Oh my God, I wish my mom was that stupid. Yeah. There were like Doritos all over the place. Isn't it crazy how there's like a funeral going on outside? It's a wake. Yeah, man, same difference. You mom was a special soul, man. Like an angel without wings. That was beautiful. I have something for us. Okay, close your eyes. Everybody. Okay, open your eyes. What do you think? Cool, man. What is it? Wow, you made this? We needed something that bonded us together. For sure, man. I'm never taking mine off ever. Even if I take it off, it's gonna be on, you know? Here, will you help me with mine? The clasp is kinda tricky. Thanks, Beth. What do you think? It's nice. Just nice? Really nice. What's wrong? I don't know. Maybe I'm just thinking about my dead mother. Thanks. Can you arrest all these people? That bad, huh? I don't know any of these people, but I hate all of them. Technically, it'll be over in about an hour. Yeah, they're not leaving. Sorry, everyone. I never figured out the whole walking thing. Where is the casket? Come on, Hector. Hey, you can't go. I can't be here. I can't let you leave, not in this condition. I haven't had anything. What time is it? A few minutes past four. I was out the whole time? Yeah, pretty much. Well, you screamed, you flew backwards, and then you passed out. - Great. - Yeah. Worked out perfectly. Everyone left once you passed out. Except you. You know, I was just thinking maybe we could go get some dinner somewhere. It doesn't have to be anything formal. It's just a meal between two old friends who haven't seen each other in seven years and are still officially boyfriend-girlfriend. I'm breaking up with you. That's good, that's good. So what time am I picking you up for dinner? You're a stalker. As far as the law's concerned, I'm not. How about nine? Gotta make sure it's okay with my wife. Hey. Can I tell you something and have you not think that I'm crazy? Well, I already think you're crazy, but I won't think you're any crazier. Something really strange has happened twice since I've been back. Strange. Strange like your living room being turned into a rehab clinic. That kind of strange. Those aren't even the worst of her friends either. No. I've been having visions. Like what? I don't know. It happens so fast, and it's not very clear. But I saw someone being dragged and tortured, or at least it seems that way. Well, it may just be a combination of jet lag and stress. I've been hearing noises too. Well, you probably shouldn't stay here. Do you think that my mom's death and that teacher's death were too similar to be a coincidence? Well, if they're not a coincidence, unfortunately your brother's the prime suspect. He didn't do it. Well, then they're just a coincidence. Look, I think the best thing for you is just to relax for the next few hours. We'll go, we'll get some good food, take your mind off things, and then we'll figure it all out tomorrow. Have there been any other deaths like that? I don't know, but I could look into it for you. Thank you. Is there anything else I can do for you before I go? No, I'm fine, thanks. Well, give me a call if you need anything. I will pick you up at nine. Wait, Tyler, sorry about earlier. No, it's totally cool. I'm happy it's officially over. Now I can finally start dating again. Do I like this color? So you're talking to me from now on? I gotta go. Hello, can I help you? The wake was a couple hours ago. You speak English? Hello, hello? This is private property. This isn't funny, whatever you're doing. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on, come on, come on, don't die! Oh yes. Oh yes, yes, yes. Yes, come on, come on. Do you need anything? Water, coffee, milk, juice? Shh. Oh, I got it, I got it. It's not that bad. You sure you want a Band-Aid up here? No, I guess not. You're pretty good at this. I had to learn. Mom was always hurting herself. I'm good with any cuts, sprains, burns, or bruises. Thanks. What happened? I don't know. I think I saw something that wasn't there. It's all foggy. It's gonna be for a while. You hit your head pretty hard. Yeah, I know. Have you seen anything? No. I'm going crazy. You're not. I thought you were dead. Wishful thinking? No. I mean, I still hate you and I will never forgive you, but I didn't want you dead. I'm sorry. I was a terrible sister. You had to almost die to realize that? - I just... - I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I get it. Honestly, I would've done the same thing. In about a year, I would've shown up at your apartment and squatted on your couch for about 10 years. Really? Maybe. 10 years? Undergrad and medical school. Your grades are good enough for that? My friends are stupid, I'm not. Speaking of which, I gotta meet them soon. We have a project in US history, and if it is a second late we drop two letter grades. But I don't want you to go. I don't want them coming here. You'll be okay? I'm going out with Tyler. What? I didn't say a word. Just be careful. I don't have to worry with him. Never trust a guy who always carries handcuffs. Hey, just 'cause we talked doesn't mean we're friends. I know. Hey, keep your phone on. I don't even have your number. Yes, you do. Your code wasn't that hard to figure out. Don't worry, I didn't look at anything else. See you later. Keep it on. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey. I called a lot. And I'm early. No, I'm sorry, my phone was on vibrate and I was out cold. Oh. It's meaningless. Thank you. And we're not going anywhere fancy, so you don't have to get too dressed up. Okay, just give me one minute, okay? And I mean it, the flower means nothing. I know, I already flushed it down the toilet. Excellent. So how's it goin'? - Almost done. - Good. 'Cause I need you for something. Give me a couple minutes. That thing man. I've got that thing. This is like some other world right here, man. Something beyond everything that you can't get in stores. And how'd you get it? Divine intervention. You'll know what I mean when you have a taste. This stuff takes you to the next dimension. What is it? I don't know. It's got a couple different names. Well, can you tell us one of them? Like tequila but more, so more, man. Look, even the worm can't handle this. This needs something deadly. Just like the first time every time. It will JFK you. I don't think I wanna ask what that's supposed to mean. It will blow your mind. Tasteful. It is. Who's next? Done. I need to type this up, can I use your computer? Yeah, man. Just put the right password in. 420God. Live that motto, man. Live that motto. I'll help you. Oh, I'm gonna make some brownies. Oh, they're gonna be so good. Hey, man. So everything on the menu's good, except for the apps and entrees. But if you're in the mood for liquor and dessert, this is the place. I got three semesters, but I don't know. I wasted everything while I was there. You going back? You know, I can finish school anywhere. I might stay and let River finish here. I mean, he could go with me, but I just don't think it'd be fair to him. Yeah, well, if you do, maybe we could eat again once in another seven years. Don't push your luck. Yeah, wouldn't even think of it. So I did some snooping around for you. Yeah? Oh, come on. What? No way. You almost done? 20 minutes, tops. That's a really long time. It'll take longer if you keep interrupting me. Don't you want a break? Don't you want a good grade? I mean, you've been working so hard, you deserve a break. I just wanna get this done. There's other things that need to get done too. I should probably... Take a break, I know. So there have been some instances? Right, right, right. Okay, a few pockets of these deaths. It goes all the way back to the 1930s. Now, like I said, I can't say that any of these deaths are related in any way, but there was a small burst of explainable sudden deaths, usually with people that either knew each other or were affiliated somehow. Well, okay. Okay, but the only problem is they weren't crimes. But they could've been. Well, we can only go off what we know, and none of 'em point to someone. If the first reported cases of these deaths were over 80 years ago, then it can't be the same person. It's probably just a coincidence. I mean, there's just strange things that happen that you just can't explain. But what if it's not a person? What would it be then? A ghost. Moon, I'm trying to help you, but we gotta go off facts and reality. I think someone tried to kill me tonight. Hey, little scorpion. That's not good. Wish I had a straw. What about you, man? What the? I'm not saying I don't believe you, but you got to admit this is pretty far out there. Did River see anything? I don't know, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen. Why don't you tell me about the first time you started believing in ghosts? This isn't funny. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm just trying to make you feel less stressed. By making fun of me. It's just spilled milk. I get so crazy. I have to go pee. Stay. And pee in bed? It's not my bed. That's so gross. What if I'm into that kinda stuff? Pass me your shirt. Don't you have work to do? Just gonna let Hector finish it later. I'll sign up for summer school now. Hey, I said you're taking a long time. It's okay if you're pooping. I know girls do that stuff too. Fine, don't talk to me. I'm getting a snack. Oh my God. No! Bethany. No, no, no. Everyone's gotta go through it, especially me. They think my dad pulled strings, which he doesn't. Hold on, excuse me. What's up? They're dead! Hector, Chrissie, Bethany, they're dead, Moon. I don't know how it happened! I don't know! Wait, hello? Hello? - No! - What's going on? River? What's wrong? River. This should cover it. - Sorry. - Okay, good luck. Moon, Moon, let me handle this. It's locked. I'm going around the back. Just like old times. River? She's dead. I told you something was happening. I'm gonna call this in. Let's find River first. And do me a favor, stay behind me this time. Is it him? No. You don't wanna look in there. Oh no, this can't be happening. The chain. Get the chain. You okay? Are you okay? Just check him. He's alive. He's trapped. What? I have to get him out. What are you saying? Look, I'm gonna call this in. We'll wait for the... No, I'm the only one that can save him. He's stable. He's stable, but he needs an EMT. You don't understand. He's not here. Please just help me carry him. Okay, Moon, you don't understand. This is a police matter. I'm gonna call this in, but if I leave the scene of a crime, I could lose my job. Please. Please. This is Forman, badge 1740. I'm in pursuit of a suspect on Hartford Street. There are two, possibly three, DOAs at 2455 Hartford Street. Send backup patrol and EMT, 10-18. Come on, we gotta get him to the workshop. What are we doing? I mean, is he... He's fine there. Okay, this is where I saw it, right here. Okay, what are you talking about? The thing that's been killing everybody. It's because of this. How do you know that? Because I've seen it. Look, can we just please stop, okay? Look, we have to get help for River right now. Come and get me. Okay, just stop, just stop, just stop. Just sit and stop. Stop for a second. Look, you need to be here with River, okay? I'll take care of it. No, you can't. My God, how do you know that for sure? You can't. Please just trust me. I'm not gonna let you kill yourself. You're all he has. It has to be me. I don't want you to go again. I won't. I'll take care of everything, I promise. I promise. Why won't you just let me take care of this? It has to be me. Mom? Mom? I'm sorry. I tried. What? To stop. I know. Where's River? I just wanted us to be us again. Mom, where's River? It's all I wanted. We can't be together without River. I tried, but nobody believed me. You tried to what? To warn you. To warn you. No, Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Moon, Moon! Bethany? Oh God, Bethany. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, Moon, come on. Come on, come on. He didn't get you. You can snap out of this. He didn't get you. There's something that reminds me of a case from 20 years ago. My God. Doesn't make any sense. Hello? No, I don't think I'm gonna be able to get to it tonight. Nah.
