Barakah, delighted. Please sit there. Leave us a bit alone. As you know, everything was going well. Two families, marriage, community service. Life, travel, trips. I was young. I did not, at first. At this age, you think you have all the time. You know, here, larger families become institutions. They represent wealth and prestige. Everything is anchored. These are the foundations of our society. Bibi is too young to emotional ties. We protect it. I said, I want my fishing equipment clean and in place. I must tell him how? My domestic workers are animals. Hamza, falling tone. We have guests. I count not lower tone, darling. It is for you to take care of the house. - Hamza! Hamza, my ass! Sorry. He drank. Aliens just outside. It is so nice. You know, I like enormously Biblio. It's the apple of my eye. My one and only. I did it. Who is this barbarian who you disrespect? Bibi is in transition. It is at this age. ... And then there's the celebrity and all. It's hard. Who is the man who yelled at you? Ah, Hamza, my husband. No, you do not imagine things. He is a good man. It has a pure heart, inside He suffered a lot of pressure. The family, the house, the ... inheritance. He would love to have a boy. A son who transmits his name. As in any family. Alas, I have a concern. A fertility concerns. Fertility? I can not have children. You must see the midwife Sa'diyya. Move the speaker to the right. A bit more. All right, that's enough. And up, get the lights! Upper! You're at it. Do not move from there. Lord, it will come out We leave for the first time. What you're scared, asshole? Of not having enough time? That time escapes us? Be strong, if ston. Relax. The night is long. Stop biler you. So what do we do? You take her where counted, big guy? I feel like "Shawarma Shaker". Two sandwiches with lamb and a fat juice. Banana and cane sugar. You know what? I'll stick to my coffee. Should not spoil these "Hips Divine." We eat in like at the time? No family area "Shaker." We eat on the sidewalk, then. Bibi, you think you're in Paris? Can not. We eat in the car, right? It's sad. That's life, I know what to tell you. And if we ate watching a great show? A show? where? There is no light? The whole neighborhood has turned off electricity to give more volts to the head of the marriage. Solidarity among neighbors. It's nice. Yes. Mate that. It's not giant? It is clear that this is not the best view. I'm used to the first class. But I appreciate the effort. Da'ash a hit. A real artist. Looked. The group is not yet complete on stage. It's too giant. That's art. It is surrounded by art. Barakah. I was joking. You could not find better tonight. It's so spontaneous. I do not get how this country has become so narrow. Narrow, but we can always escape from a roof. That is true. Bibi. Barakah. Yes, my sweet and tender? I Barakah. My name Barakah. I've always been Barakah, from birth. This is the name on my passport. But as I was loose and embarrassed, I did call Biblio. Impossible. It's a girl's name, I know. But it's weird. - Bizarre, yes, but ... That's weird ... As soon as I knew your name was Barakah I felt as if the cosmos united these two weird names. It's a blessing, right? Come come. Go, go. Really you, you did not bowl. This old skin ended to your date on your own roof? It was about touching, Da'ash. I never touched or held the hand of a girl. Must Sa'diyya, I have always defended, come to screw the ground? I repeat, this is a real torture. Shame on you. Everything you offer ASA and you're still a virgin? Me, at your age, I had to whistle, and Women flocked. I had my own harem! This will be his birthday. I want out. Why the world is against us? You do not chickweed. Let it be your uncle. Should you harden a bit. Without offend you, your advice, it's agony. I'd rather not. - Be hair is present. Be brave and let me do. Must find a solution. If the concern is the Face ... Put a burqa. It would be eccentric. And if it's one of those golden emirates, it will be divine. - have believed you there? A cream Face. Must See His Face! And if we created something Instagram kind large scale? Cool clips. No, it should be present, the parent company requires. We will find. We have to. What if we used a hologram? A scene, public, lights. It's a little expensive, certainly. But it will be recorded and seen as direct. - As direct. The media give you top rankings. They think you hesitate because of money. They offer you two million , and a 3-year contract. That's six million riyals, Biblio. The catch? If you refuse their offer, this golden opportunity in smoke leave. This is the maximum. It's time to say yes. Money is not everything. Bibi, I'm in this business for over 20 years. I created three quarters of the stars of this country. This offer is by far the best you do aurasjamais. Six millions, to be their ambassador and appear in public. You think it's me they want? They want my followers on Instagram. They are interested only in "likes" and fans. Where they come, these "likes" and fans? You have an original thing, that's why. I will delete my Instagram account. Bibi! Bibi! - My family requires. Do not tell me you have believed in your independence. At this lie of the art anti-consumerist worthy and anti-materialist? It makes no sense. Even Mayyada advantage of you, financially too. And you know she was selling your body. You got a chance to show your face and become a celebrity. a leader Not just half of a public body, and the other half, who knows what. Bibi, if you sign, it's perfect. Otherwise, sorry but I'll have to take legal action, which will be extremely challenging for you. Where are you taking me tonight, Barakah? It is a surprise. A suprise? Yes, but I have to cover your eyes. Do not. - Yes. A real surprise, then! For a surprise, it will be one. barakah, when do you gonna take me? I feel we are on a boat on the water. Stop being so dramatic, I take it off! Oh, are you crying? - No it's nothing. A dust in the eye. I missed my shot? Are you afraid of water? No, it's the opposite. Thank you to bring me back to that life. This freedom, the air, the smell of the sea. If only we appreciated most. Fuck the beaches of the rich. The barriers that separate and divide. The new ethane God is mere soft. We can not, Barakah. It is in public. I care about the people. I'm here because I want to be with you. I do not care of others. What I mean… I do not know how to say. Say what you feel. Te unjustified. Say what you have in you. You, you know how to say what you feel. That's what I love about you. Not always. I often feel alone in this world. Your phone keeps ringing and you feel alone? You think I have nothing to do? I feel even more alone. Later we will do? Mayyada was painful in recent days. What time is it? Midnight. Midnight folds?
