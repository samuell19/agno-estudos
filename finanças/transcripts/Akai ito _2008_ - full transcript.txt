Everyone's great, though! It's all great! You're high Your pupils I'm fine What's this? Nothing This is how they push their drugs Mia! Mei? Atsushi... Chill out ljust tried it, that's all It's not you. Maybe it is. Who cares? I do, Mia! You're too late I was in pain! Mitsu dumped me I thought this would help me forget I'm sorry I couldn't be there foryou But drugs won't solve anything It'll ruin you, Mia! I'll quit. I promise Okay. I trust you I've only done it a few times I can give it up easily No, she can't They all say that It doesn't matter if you trust her Atsushi... you've changed How can you be so sure? You don't know what she's been through orwhat she's capable of She can quit if she wants What Mia wants doesn't matter There's a lot in this world you just can't control I know that But even so, I believe in Mia She says she'll stop Fine Taka, sorry How many times did I call you?

This doesn't concern you Taka was there for me when everybody wanted me dead Taka rescued me, not you! So don't interfere! Bye bye! See you tomorrow "From Taka" Atsushi! Welcome home! Mom? Why? Rehab's over I worked real hard so we could live together I found work, too Work? At a supermarket I start tomorrow But you just got out Don't worry I've got a lot to make up for I'm making a fresh start A festival sounds like fun Who're you going with? Taka, a friend from middle school You going out with him? Yeah He's real kind and caring And fun to be with He gets a bit paranoid sometimes but he really cares for me Did you hurt yourself? This bruise I fell during sports I'm off! Be careful! Thanks forcoming You should've told me you were back Sorry I'll forgive you I wanted to ask you something Why'd you break up with Mei? Gotta be a reason Break ups usually follow loss of interest You lost interest You're a lame liar. I'm not lying The other night... Mei said I rescued her when she was down, remember? If Mei heard me say this she'd say I was wrong but she's tried real hard to fall in love with me And I thought I could replace you But I can't I overheard you two talking way back at the school festival Since then I've felt like there's something you and Mei Like what? I don't know An invisible kind of fate A thread When you hit me, I realized... This guy still loves Mei! I don't know what happened but... I'm guessing only you can make her happy She's here, you know Even if you're right some things can't work "Mei" "Connecting to voicemail." "Leave a message at the tone." "You have one new message." "Playing first message." "Mei," "I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused you." "My lack of confidence made me selfish." "And abusive." "Stupid, huh?" "You at the shrine?" "I figured out something." "The person you need to see right now is not me, but Atsushi." "Being with you was the best." "But I'm not the one who can make you happy." "Mei, thanks for doing your best to like me." "Let's all go back to the way" "we were in middle school." Welcome back How was it? Mom? Taka is gone He said he'd never leave my side He said he'd protect me Mei? Mom... Taka is dead! "Happy 16th Birthday, Mei" "Happy Birthday To You..." "Happy Birthday DearMei" "Happy Birthday To You..." Congratulations, Mei! Thank you Let's eat! Where's Mitsu? I called him But he's probably too embarrassed to come Hey He came Happy birthday, Mei Thank you You're late! Sit! How've you been, Mia? Wonderful I'm seeing a total hunk right now Really? No. But what do you care? When did we last get together like this? Taka's funeral? Yeah, it's been 6 months Remember how much fun our middle school festival was? Taka's band. And the Goth-Lolita dancers Don't remind me But Sara's dancing was atotal trip! She was possessed I wonderhow she's doing Hey. I'm with my friends from middle school So, how're you two doing? Soccer gets in the way Soccergot you into school Maybe it's just right. You two are so mature Welcome to high school Hey, Atsushi didn't come You invited him? Are you stupid? That's okay. Let's eat! Time to eat! We're all leading separate lives now but let's do this again Yeah! Let's eat it Welcome back I'm home Going out? The late shift We're low on staff So they asked me to come in That's right, it's your birthday! You thought I'd forget? No way. It only comes every 4 years We'll celebrate when I get back Thanks But why tell Mei now? Because we owe it to her Our marital problems have nothing to do with that There's a right time... The time is now I know our kids best What's the problem? Mei We need to talk What is it? Your father and I have decided to live apart Why? We haven't seen eye-to-eye on many things And those differences became too big to overcome I'm sorry Dad... There's one more... one more thing we need to tell you No, Sachiko It's okay They're both old enough now Mei... Truth is... I'm not yourreal mother Your biological mother was a childhood friend of mine She died when you were little So your father and I raised you as our own Nishino "This is the Futaba Recovery Center." "Is Natsumi Nishino there?" She's out "I see. Could you have her call us back?" "We'd like to talk to her." "Her doctor is very concerned." Didn't she finish her rehab? "No. She left due to an emergency back home." Is Natsumi Nishino here? Nishino? Part-time worker? Yes Manager, do you know a Ms. Nishino? Yeah, she quit soon after starting She just stopped coming You are? Nevermind. Thank you Atsushi Nishino... and you were neighbors in the same apartment building Your mom's name was Machiko She and Atsushi's mom were friends who helped each otherout But Atsushi's mom Natsumi, started seeing a man A man involved with drugs Mom? Atsushi, what a surprise? Come to take me home? Your mom was really worried about Natsumi Then your father was suddenly arrested Arrested? Fordrug possession But your real mom and dad were not the types to get involved with drugs But yourmother... was devastated and grew ill She died, leaving you alone Afteryourfather's arrest Natsumi disappeared... with a terrible man Your mother would still be alive today if it weren't forNatsumi That's why I still can't bring myself to forgive her Let's go Don't get the wrong idea. Your mother called me Let's go She'll be back You destroyed her... and the lives of everyone around her It was destroyed from the start The drugs just let her forget You're a child who's sacrificed much for his parent But her life would've been easier without you Stop it! That's what you always say Stop! Still don't get it? She wanted to be with me, not you Oh my God! I asked Atsushi to stay away from you He didn't say a word but just nodded I'm so sorry for not telling you Do you love him, Mei? "With Atsushi, good is great, and bad is bearable." "On our 16th birthday, I pray for snow." Mommy, hurry! You're late You remembered our promise Been well? Not really Why didn't you tell me? No matter what you said no matter what happened... I should've trusted you Will we... meet again? Listen, Mei They say one meets 30,000 people in a lifetime About 3,000 at school and work About 300 friends We were all in there Taka and Sara... you and I Amazing, don't you think? You taught me something important So no matterhow we part... I believe there's a reason why we met Atsushi... happy birthday Bye-bye "That's enough for me" "I'll settle for the love we shared" "Though I know you won't return I'd like to think we're bound" "To a fate that keeps us close as we're apart" "Even though life disallows a brief and bittersweet reunion" "You kept your promise" "That's enough for me" "Happy Birthday, Mei! Feb. 29, 2000" "As I wish for what can never be" "That you may fall in love with me again" "I can only hope, I can only dream" Ah, I'm sorry "That you could be with me right now" It's all messed up. "That you could be with me right now" Sorry "That you could be with me right now" Are you all right? Oh, what a shame "That's enough for me" I got a new one "That's enough forme" Is today your birthday? Yeah, February 29th "I'll settle for the love we shared" Comes once every 4 years "I'll settle for the love we shared" I know. It's my birthday, too "Even my hope in someday" I know. It's my birthday, too "Even my hope in someday" Really? "Has been forbidden" Wow! This is like a miracle! "Has been forbidden" I guess we're both having birthday parties today, huh? I don't know "Leaving me alone with my questions" "Could I have forgotten you back then?" "There tears provide the answer" "My heart can bear no lie" Here.Huh? "I rememberyou so well" Happy birthday "it's almost frightening" Thanks "Your smell, your gestures everthing" "If you think it funny, laugh and tell me so" "But since we parted all I do is think of you" "I never knew that love could be so painful" "I never knew that love could be so sad" "But this is what I've come to feel when I think of you" "I remember you so well it's almost frightening" "Your smell, your gestures everthing" "Though you cannot return to me" "It's just you... and only you" "Forme, there's only you"
