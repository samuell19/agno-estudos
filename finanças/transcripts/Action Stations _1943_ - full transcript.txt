Action stations! Action stations! Action stations! The Royal Canadian Navy. The Royal Canadian Navy, since the outbreak of war, has grown into a powerful force, designed especially for escort duty, for the task of escorting the convoys of the United Nations to fronts of a world in arms. From Canada's coasts move convoys of Canadian war supplies. Pitted against them, the wolf packs of Hitler's U-boats. Cruel is the realization of heavy losses at sea, each sinking a toll in arms, medicines, food, robbed from a regiment in the field. Charged with the task of combating the U-boat is the corvette, fastest-maneuvering weapon of attack. The convoys carry to the Mediterranean front the tanks, planes, and guns vitally needed in the campaign. Arms to force the surrender of lands overrun by Hitler. Convoys are moving to Britain and the new fronts, 200,000 men transported, not a single life lost by enemy action. Action and waiting for action in the isles of Britain and four million men under arms, to be supplied, fed, and clothed for the day when they drive deep into Nazi-held Europe. Hulls loaded down to the pencil line, and the baleful eye of the enemy turns upon cargos intended for Soviet Russia, Africa, the near-east and the South Pacific. For every cargo lost, we must bring one more. Sea lanes are lifelines to Asia and China and supplies must be flown across Tibet and the Himalayas. In China, what weary fighters say, we need trucks, yes, and tanks and planes. Give us these and we will drive the Japanese into the sea. North to the Arctic, Murmansk, and the White Sea. The bridge of Allied shipping spans frozen latitudes to our Russian ally. Seamen wonder sometimes, driving North in the cold watches between enemy attack, do people back home know what it means? Storm and fog, even the elements are enemies, with death like an armed man standing guard. Was there ever a house in a quiet street where I once lived? Do children still play in the sun? Here only, is the enemy, the horizon, and the sea. Only men who have fought through ice packs know it's hard, tough going on the road to Russia. Premier Stalin said "Artillery is the god of war." These Russians say, tomorrow we attack with Canadian tanks, fine tanks, but we need more and more again. Weapons for men fighting for freedom. Diving out of leaden Atlantic skies, Nazi planes flying from bases in Norway continue the ruthless campaign to cut Allied supply lines, no matter the cost. Seamen of the merchant navy are the infantry of the battle at sea. On them rests the heavy responsibility of manning the convoy ships, and then fight best to have seen survivors of the battle at sea, struggling and dying in the hell of flaming oil. The work of Canada's navy never ends. Convoys do not retreat when the enemy attacks or withdraw to new positions. The convoys sail on, having no choice and wishing no other. History is in the making through Canada's growing sea power. As Canada's sea power grows, new ships and new men are training in the coastal waters. Men who will sail the ships built and building in Canadian shipyards. Captain of our new corvette. He's 27 and was formerly an interior decorator in Victoria. Number One was a lawyer in Edmonton. Our navigator pilot is from Toronto. And our asdic officer, from Vancouver. Asdic, that's the new submarine detector device. With it, he can hear the beat of a sub's engines deep in the sea. Somewhere in the ancestry of these new seamen are men who sailed the uncharted North, made the long haul with Frobisher, dared the St. Lawrence and the Grand Banks with... New seamen from the farmlands, from the mines and factories and offices. Seamen fighters for our new corvette, the Port Arthur. Roll along, Wavy Navy, roll along, roll along Roll along, Wavy Navy, roll along If you don't know who we are We're the RCNVR Roll along, Wavy Navy, roll along Oh we joined for the money and the fun, and the fun Oh we joined for the money and the fun Of the money we have none, but the fun has just begun Roll along, Wavy Navy, roll along Gunnery drill develops teamwork. - Load SAP! - Load SAP! - Stand by! - Stand by! - Fire! - Fire! Cease firing! Gun loaded with SAP sir. - Unload! - Unload! Training takes place at sea, even PT, although this has gone recreational training. Session ends on deck with an old schoolyard game, Buck Buck. Not so easy when the ship is rolling. Steady, steady. The ship lurches and not so steady. Training is endless routine, harder than the long wait for action. But training, no matter how long, how endless, fits us for the dangers of the sea. - Slip! Sailor men grouse about training, but always we remember that this can lead to this. The price of safety and survival is men's hardihood. Abandon ship! Abandon ship! Over, ya go! Training ended, the Port Arthur heads out to see under the traditional signal, being in all respects ready for sea and to engage the enemy. At ports on east and west coasts, fleets of U-boat hunters are gathering, ships light, fast, maneuverable. The corvette is trim, almost yacht-like, sleek lines cunningly camouflaged to blend with sea and sky. Packing a punch potent beyond proportion to size, the corvette is a highly-mobile weapon of destruction. With her speed and sturdy construction swinging into attack, the pattern of depth charges rolled off the deck will crush the hull of an enemy sub like an eggshell between sudden terrifying blasts. Each new ship is another weapon in the battle of the seven seas. Already the Canadian Navy escorts nearly half of all Atlantic convoys of the United Nations. Since 1939, ship-building in Canada has grown amazingly. In 1942, 500 ships completed, 37 times the total for the first year of the war. As ship-building has grown, enlistments have kept pace. 48,000 now in the service and the Canadian Navy is the only navy with a waiting list. To follow the thousands already at sea come replacements, taken up from the volunteer reserve. Leading seaman Joe Turner, a machine gunner, has an ambition, to get a sub. Image of the lucky wanted, the U13. The U13, our natural prey to be added to the toll of enemy subs sunk. Today, that toll, four times the number sunk in 1940. When the ship's in port, everyone knows what a sailor likes to do, but only the fortunate men catch the liberty boat. Most of the ships companies have duties, even in port. Stores must be loaded, supplies renewed, working watches maintained. Of course, seamen hate to leave their mates at work on the ship to sit in a coffee house spinning yarns to landsmen. The navy sets no limit on those tall yarns except where security enters, and no seaman in this complex war violates the closed lips order. 12,000 ships handled 65 million tons of wartime shipping, battened it down, and carried it safely through the danger zone. Only by sea routes can we feed and supply our fighting men. There are no safe subterranean tunnels to the front lines. The planes to bomb Berlin, tanks to crush Hitler in Russia, must be ferried from arsenals an ocean's-width away. And the men who drive those tanks and follow in the transports and trucks of mechanized war. Nurses, doctors, technicians, men to fly those planes must be convoyed with all the speed safety will allow. In the harbor, the convoy ships ride at anchor while the captains meet in a secret conference to receive last-minute instructions. Each movement must be planned and exactly coordinated. For the first time, the navy reveals how carefully convoys are organized. The roll of ships is called. Each captain answers for his vessel. - Gentlemen. Has every master his sailing orders, please? Look out, as much as you can afford, at all angles as laid down there and if you see anything that doesn't belong in the convoy, please report it to the commodore in escort immediately. And repeat immediately under 500 kilocycles any information indicating the whereabouts of the submarine, which might be a value to the commodore or escort, so please be sure that that is understood. Now, gentlemen, I introduce you to your commodore, Admiral Sir Francis Austin of the steamship Salacia. - Good morning gentlemen, I'm very glad to meet nearly all of you. Captain has... with me. Now this is a great opportunity for us to come to some general conclusion about what we're going to do and how we're going to do it. My instructions from the admiralty and my responsibilities are to take the convoy safely to our destination. Overseeing the safety of the convoy. Anbody who breaks them endangers the whole convoy, not only himself, but all the other ships in it. No chance of protecting us. They may avenge somebody's death, but they've got no chance of protecting us. I'd rather be protected, myself. I'm all for protection. I think the escorts are all for revenge. I hope that you realize that the signals I make are not made for my own pleasure or for fun, or because I have nothing better to do. Every signal I make guided to an individual ship or General of the convoy is an effort to ensure the safety of the convoy and I'll, just once more, ask your cooperation. Happy returns to us all. Now gentlemen, I introduce you to the senior officer of your escort, Lieutenant Holencastle, HMS Witherington. Thank you gentlemen. I've got very little to add to what the commodore and LCSO said. If you see any of the escorts hoist a black parent or a red flag and a black parent, that means they're about to attack or they've got a contact. See if you can keep out of their way, and you'll know there's probably a depth charge is coming fairly soon, a black parent or a red flag and a black comb. - I can't hear, excuse me, I can't hear. Listen to the escort, you have a good escort. We ask to keep up, in station, in a compact body and I'm sure that they'll give you the proper protection. And we wish you bon voyage and happy landings. Morning of the convoy sailing. The laden ships are waiting, steam is up, ready to stand out to sea, protected by their escort. Goodbyes are casual. Goodbye, good luck, bon voyage, see you on the other side. And just before the convoy sailed, our new corvette Port Arthur was inspected by Vice-Admiral Lellis, chief of the naval staff. Captain, officers in ship's company of this new corvette, in a very few days you will be taking this new corvette to sea. You have the same chances as they have had to distinguish themselves. Don't forget too that you and they are making the tradition in sea power of Canada. Remember, the U-boat is your prey. Destroy them or they will destroy us. And this is where you are carrying out the common task of all the Allies in that whenever or wherever or however we meet the enemy, we knock them out. And I wish to say now, good luck to you all, and good hunting. Goodbye, Port Arthur. Goodbye, sir. Best of luck, and I hope you have even better success than you did in your last ship. Thank you very much sir. For three years, the armadas have been gliding past the citadel of Halifax, city of war, front door to the battle of the Atlantic. From Halifax have gone the convoys loaded with the products of war. Ships of every type and tonnage fit for sea are used, thrust into service in the struggle for survival and liberation. These are combined convoys, the escort vessels may be United States cruisers. Dutch, Norwegian, British, the ships are all registry. Liberty ships now building in U.S. yards at a rate of more than one a day. Even a whaler, through its stern whales were once hauled. And sailing in separate troop convoys are the faster ships, the giant liners. The senior ship leads the escort vessels. Hovering above the laden freighters are the Catalina flying boats. On the Grand Banks off Newfoundland, across the grey wastes as far as Iceland, patrol planes precede the convoy, ready to swoop on the first U-boat to thrust its snout above the surface. Our training has fit us for the appointed task, bringing this convoy safely to its destination. We will zigzag off the convoy quarter in steady, methodical sweeps. As we take up our station, bearing is checked on the leading ship. Signals come in continually. Reports on enemy movements, weather reports, warnings and instructions. Communications bear heavily on the safety of the convoy. Our convoy carries its own eye in the sky. Elaboration between air force and navy provides us with our own emergency reconnaissance. But the eyes of the ship are the lookouts. On each lookout depends the safety of the ship, perhaps the fate of the whole convoy. At sea, the task of the lookout is endless, intensive, constant, vigilance. The slow searching of the reaches of the sea for the feathery wake that means submarines. Always the alert, patient scanning of the horizon, watching for a sign that will send us running to action stations. Up spirits! Once a day, grog rations are issued. Up spirits is a traditional call inherited from the British navy. And the early watch is cold today. Gales in the North Atlantic rise with sudden elemental violence. Speed is reduced, we move only as fast as the slowest ship. The convoy plunges on. Campaigns do not wait on weather. While the storm lasts, hazards and dangers double. Ships must be kept in line by the escort vessels, lest they drop behind, lashed into isolation by the turbulence of the sea. Wavering, pounding, from the heart of the ship, the engines transmit the power to drive us on against the battering weight of the waves. And then after a long night and a day, the force of the gale drops. The convoy moves on, ships in order and lines unbroken. Life at sea means learning to live together. In the rough democracy of the foxhole, feuds are forgotten before the face of common danger and a common foe. Machine gunner Joe still nurses his ambition, getting a U13. Foremost in our minds is the threat of submarines, on watch or below, sleeping or waking, and the slower the convoy, the more present is the danger. From the senior ship comes a signal, fog moving up. Fog, deadly enemy and sometime friend, on occasion a means of escape during attack but more imminent still is the possibility of collision. The danger of crashing into another ship grows ever more real. On the commodore's ship, Sir Francis Austin, who said at the captains' meeting that he does not make signals for fun, sets his officers to the job of keeping the ships closed up. Almost we prefer storm, at least we can see. Now we edge along by dead reckoning. A distance indicator, our only means of checking position, and we check again and again. We wait, trying to pierce the gloom for the signal light that will come as the fog begins to lift. Flashing light ahead, sir! And then, suddenly the signal. Light, dead ahead. Speed increases, the engines rev up. Contact established. The fog is lifting and the message passes down the long lines of ships. Fog clearing. Bright weather and the convoy plows on. Through the fog that might have meant disaster, the ships have kept station. It is a tribute to well-nigh-perfect navigation. The little while between storm and attack, we can stretch in the sun. For seamen off watch, this is life at sea at its best. Clear sailing follows in the wake of danger. But for the navy, reality has little of the romantic. Every stray sign means menace. Floating wreckage is the silent evidence of disaster. The convoy ahead has been attacked. Come on lads, let's get a can ready for these sons o' guns. Stand by, depth charges. Subs are known to cruise around a drifting lifeboat. Steady. Fire away, that'll do. All right, all right, secure. Twilight is the time best suited for attack on a convoy, when the chances are heavily in favor of the submarine. Between watches, the ship's company relaxes during what seamen call make and mend sessions. But above the deck, the lookout stands his constant vigil, on guard for that telltale wake, the glint in the sea that will send us to battle stations in 25 seconds. At night, we steam on, running without lights under the order darkened ship. You've steamed for thousands of miles, for days and nights, on the alert in wet and darkness, hundreds of middle watches, weeks of eye strain and dirty weather, but you have to get that sub. You want to be in on the real thing. At dusk, in the half-light of closing day, a ship stands out in bolder silhouette against the sky, against the sky, easier target for a torpedo launched by a lurking submarine. Danger, danger all about us. From the senior ship, a message flickers. Submarine in the vicinity, carry out a sweep. That sound on the asdic detector, the engines of a submarine. I have a contact, sir. Our officer has picked up the beat of a sub cruising under the surface. If we locate the sub's position, our corvette will swing directly for it, hurling depth charges as we go, even try to ram the raider if possible. Hang onto it, follow it, don't lose it. We're coming about. Change course, port 10 amidships. Steady she goes, steady. Closer now. Definitely a sub sir, quite close to us. That's it, keep after it. We'll swing right over and start blasting. It's time to break through our lines to the convoy. Action stations! Action stations! For the gun, quick, quick! Flip the covers off, open the breach, break out ammunition. Depth charges ready, port door is closed up. Sub seems to be surfacing. Enemy in sight, star shell, star shell. There it is, on the surface. Enemy in sight, on target, on target. The sub is escaping on the surface. Out of sight, no target. It's fading, running away from us, I can just make out the sound. We're losing it. It's gone, got away. Contact lost, sir. We can't get them all, but we can make it hunt for them once we pick up the trail. That's the way it goes. That's what happened to me when we met the U15. I was below when the warning came. Action stations! Action stations! Lower leg in the hammock. On the double, on the double! I stood to my gun, I couldn't see the sub yet. All around me, men were running to their positions. Port doors were closed up. Number one all ready sir! We must be almost on top of it now. Submarine off starboard deep, this is it. Attack pennant, the warning. We're closing up. There go the guns, the sub has slipped inside the line of ships. Emergency speed for attack. And the engines pick it up. Number one gun on target. The sub's got one of our ships, stand by depth charges. Fin out, first depth charge ready. - Stand by! - Stand by! - Fire! - Fire! We're going right over it now. Fire two! Roll charges in order. There goes the underwater blast. Now the surface explosion. We drop 'em above and below the sub. Fire three! From side as well as stern, we're slinging the charges until our pattern covers that sub. He got away, no. Did we get it? Or did it get away? Was the setting right? She might sink and we'll never see her. If she blows I'll blast her to hell. Sure, those charges must 'o got her. Sub surfacing off starboard beam. Above surface, bearing green 9-0. Open fire, independent! Fire! - That's funny. - What's wrong? They don't return our fire. Number one gun, bear on target, gun loaded. What's orders, sir? Stand by, hold your fire. They seem to be surrendering, keep them covered. Fire across the bow. Well that one's right across their nose. They're quitting, they're quitting! They're giving up! I don't know, they could be faking but if one of those babies makes a false move, we're ready. Number One takes over the boarding party. Start the falls, flip! Row at the base head. His instructions, take as many prisoners as possible, shoot if you have to, get their code books and above all prevent scuttling, we want that sub intact. Steady, this may be a trick. Watch yourself, she may try to crash-dive. All right, get them aft. Push them back toward the stern. Give it to them if they resist. Herd 'em back, go on, get back you. One man's keeping outta sight. The sub commander? No, we got him with our first burst. It's the first officer. Hey, you, come here. Get up on that conning tower, go on. Up with ya, come on. No, no, she blow up, she blow up. Set a time bomb to prevent capture. She'll likely blow any minute. Number One is going down. They didn't take any chances. They've scuttled her as well. Hurry Number One, hurry. We keep 'em covered, Number One's still inside. He'd better come up, there's not much time left. She's beginning to sink, you'd better come up, sir. She's settling fast. Swim for it, get to the boats, quick. Every man, jump for it. We swing in to pick up our men. Some of the Germans seemed afraid to jump. The Nazis still want trouble. And he got it! Our men are safe, all but Number One. He's got to get away fast or the sub may drag him under. One minute to get clear before she blows. She's down by the stern and sinking fast. And there she goes, with another Nazi who hung on too long. That's one you'll never see again! We count noses when the boarding party returns. No casualties, five prisoners taken, and one sub sunk. We didn't get the U13. Instead, we got the U15. Good news flashes out to all escort vessels. Successful attack, submarine captured and sunk. One more enemy U-boat lies at the bottom of the sea and from the senior ship comes the signal rewarding successful attack. Well met and well done. On all the oceans of the globe, fighting seamen are bringing the convoy safely through. Doing its part in keeping those sea waves free. Canada's young navy stands at action stations, ready for sea and to engage the enemy.
