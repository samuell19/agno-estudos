The Great White Shark is known as a man-eater. I grew up hearing tales of its murderous strength and tenacity. But I truly didn't understand its full power until... until today. Alyssa? Alyssa? We should talk some more... about what happened... Hello! Put your pants on Grandpa, because the fun's arrived. Haha!! This place is small. Plenty of room for what I've got planned. What, The others are going to be here soon. No, they're not. Why do you think I drove so fast. I also gave Pamela the wrong directions too. Oh, you're bad. I told you this class would be fun. Ya but, There's all that... science stuff though. And the salt water messes Up my skin. We've only got two boat trips and otherwise we're here, miles from the ocean, OK? Why do you think I got my dad to rent this place? You're so smart. Let's go... Haha! Yep. Bryce and Marcie are already here. I wonder where they are... I can take a guess. Oh by the way.. Thanks for the lift up here by the way, Jess. Oh... Tyler... it's no problem... anytime... I figured Ms. Vansen would be here by now with the others. I'm really excited to the oceanic field trips tomorrow? Aren't you? Yeah... sure. It'll be fun. I say we go explore the house. Do you think we should? Maybe we should wait for the... others... Huhhh!!! Now that's what I'm talking about. I know.. I think actually almost finished. Oh, you finished. I did? Of course. You're with me. Oh... nice. Oh, no... I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I didn't know anyone was in here. Join in, if you want. Oh, no... I... no...sorry... Hey, could you bring our bags up here? Um... sure... That was mean. What? I offered her sex, what more does the nerdling want? Oh, Bryce. You're funny. I know... Noises! Hello? I know someone's here. Hi. Hi, Ms. Vansen... And what have you two been up to? Just checking the place out. Making sure it's up to snuff. Wanna tell my Dad it's all good. Right. You know this is a working field trip? Over 50% of your grade is based on the work you do here. Of course. I love the ocean... I'm sorry I'm late. Got lost on the way up here. Are Jess and Tyler here? Jess is here somewhere. I think she's taking in all the big things there are to see here. The others are just grabbing their things. Get settled and we'll meet back in the living room in a bit! Super. We have our room all picked out. The sheets are dirty though... Bryce... you're terrible. No, I'm the awesome. Speaking of not awesome... Yay, the weirdo is here. I'm not telling you again. Get your stuff go up to your room. I'm sorry, Alyssa. I'll make sure they're a little less juvenile. It's OK. I am weird. Huh, We're all weird. Oh, Is Denny still out there? In the car! He's getting the bags. Why don't you get settled and find a room and We'll meet up In the living room in a little bit. That everything from the car, Denny? Yeah. Great. Thanks for all your help. Oh, It's no problem. You looking forward to this weekend? Yeah. It'll be good. I just hope I don't get sea-sick. Oh you'll be fine. Come in. Hi, Alyssa... I have your bag. Oh... thanks. You want me to put it somewhere? Wherever is fine. Oh... right... I'm looking forward to this... I was glad are school made it an elective... I mean, I would do this even without the credit, you know...? I 'spose so. Yeah... I heard your dad was a pretty famous ocean explorer. Yeah... what about it? Oh... nothing... I mean I read some of his articles online... really fascinating... oceanic anthropology seems really cool... I just... I'll just go... Haha!! Haha!! Bryce, Marcie, I'm not going to tell you again. Keep your hands off each other . I want to thank all of your for signing up for this elective class, Oceanic Anthropology. Do to some sizable donations, we're not only spending the weekend in this beautiful home... You're welcome, everybody. Cause this is one of my dad's places. Don't steal anything or I'll know. ...as I was saying, we'll also be going on two boat trips to study the various sea life and its corresponding impact on the native people through time. Any questions! Um, my folks have a place in La Jolla, so I was wondering if for that term paper thingee, If I can interview them or something since they live near the ocean... and they live in time... don't they? Yes, Marcie, your parents live in time, but we're going to keep the topics to slightly older indigenous cultures. Oh, cause my folks have been members of the yacht club for like, 20 years. No. Oh... OK. Any other questions? Is there extra credit we can do? Oh, my God, Did you really just ask that? The syllabus explains all the assignments and all the opportunities for extra credit. so there's a list of approved topics. It's all pretty simple, really. Any other questions? Can I do a film instead of a term paper? I want to go to film school and they let me do it in some of my other classes. Well... see me after and we'll discuss some kind of compromise. Whatever Spielberg. Hey, Don't bug me, Bryce. I'd also like to mention our own Alyssa. Why? Because her father Scotti is one of the most.. Was one of the most important people in are field oceanic anthropology. Isn't that right, Alyssa? Yeah... I... I thought you could help some of the other kids since you were on the expeditions quite a bit! Yes... but... I was little... Her dad made a lot of enemies. How do you know that? I read. My dad loved me. Not saying he didn't. Just that he had a history of exploiting native populations in order to sell their artifacts to wealthy art collectors. That's not true! It is I read it on the internet. From reputable news sites. Awesome, it's a nerd throwdown. Bryce... My daddy love me... Jess, please.. . I mean there's still a mystery about how he died... Jess, was that necessary? What did I do? I was going to ask her for help on my paper. I just was hope she was better with her dad passing. I'm guessing that's a big, fat, dead 'no.' Haha!! Just be nice. That was awesome, keep that up. Let's go to the hot-tub. Oh Ya! Rurrr.. What are you looking at! I didn't do anything wrong. she shouldn't get a better grade because her dad died... that's not fair. Alyssa, I'm really sorry I didn't mean to upset you. I just figured because you were taking this class... That you were feeling better about what happened to your dad. I'm sorry... I am. No... wait. I'm sorry. I'm not sure why I took this class... I haven't thought about the ocean... or much of anything since he disappeared five years ago. You're right... I need to move on. I thought he might come back one day... Mom says he died in the ocean. Disappeared on one of his expeditions. She won't talk to me about him. People will deal with pain differently. My dad is not coming back, is he? No. All I know about the ocean is that I know he's gone now... I just feel it inside of me. I haven't I know he's gone now... I just feel it inside of me. I haven't went anywhere near the ocean since he disappeared. Maybe that's why you took the class, because you're ready to move on. To go back to the ocean... Write about your dad that will really help you.. You're probably right... but I don't think I can go out into the ocean tomorrow... I just can't yet. You don't have to! Your OK. Just stay here! But I do hope you finish the class! And write about your dad? It will really help you. I think you're right. I'll do it, Ms. Vansen. Thank you. I'm glad I could be here for you, Alyssa. And call me Pamela. I'm your friend. I know. And if you need any help on your paper just let me know. It'll only between you and I. I appreciate that. You hang in there. And don't let the others get you down. You're time to move on is now. Thanks... Pamela. Yes! I still don't think I did anything wrong. Just drop it already. You're right... sorry. I didn't know all that stuff about Alyssa's dad. I don't know that much... about her at all. So how did her dad die? What's the scoop? He found an indigenous of Indians of the coast of Mexico. They supposedly worshipped an enormous Great White Shark that hunted in the area. Ooh, this is good, go on. Yeah, please, go on. Well, Scotti has a history of robbing the these kind of cultures of their talisman... Like Cortes and the Aztecs? Not on such a grandiose scale, no, Cortes brought down an empire with greed and superstition and guns, where as Scotti just stole objects and sold them. Who cares, get back to the shark. Well, Scotti gained the trust of the tribe and they told him where he could find the shark. So, He organized a hunt for some wealthy fisherman and they killed the tribe's god. Holy cow. They must have been pissed. Scotti disappeared off the fishing boat the night before they were going to head back to the States with the Shark's body. The tribe took him? No one knows. The tribe seemed to disappear after that. effects washed up on the beach a few days later, but that was it. You think they killed him? There's rumors he was cursed. Cursed? Awesome. How? They're just rumors in a part of the world full of strange customs. Was Alyssa with him? I don't know. She went with him a lot, but she was never mentioned very much. Dinner's being delivered in a bit in case you're wondering. Eat where you like. But remember we are leave early tomorrow morning, so don't stay up late. OK. I'll be ready. Can I talk to you about my film idea? Later. I've got to find Bryce and Marcie first, hope they're not doing something that's going to get me fired. Good luck with that. Bryce, Marcie, dinner's going to be here soon. If you could bring it out to us on a silver tray, that would beawesome. I'm going to say this once. If either one of you causes a problem or mouths off or gets in trouble, you're going problem or mouths off or gets in trouble, you're going to spend the rest of the weekend in your rooms and your going to get a big fat 'F' for the class. You understand? Yes ! Yes, Ms. Vansen. I promise. No more screwing around for us. The rest of the weekend in the house sounds perfect. I hate fish. Ms. Vansen? You in here... ...I guess not. Now this is nice... Feeling better, Alyssa? Yes... I am. Thanks. Good. How was dinner? Fine. Tell you what, when we get back tomorrow, why don't we talk some more? I know I should talk about my dad... but... Don't worry... we'll just talk and see where it leads us. I'd like that. Get some sleep. So, Teach, like what you see? I do. Though you have to do some extra credit. Aren't I already? You should be paying me by now! You'll get yours when I get mine. That's always been our agreement. I was just kidding, sheesh... Hey, Don't be like that. Isn't everything OK with Alyssa? Ya. She's going to talk to me about her dad. See, you're halfway to a best seller. I know it. I mean, Jess told me about all that shark and curse stuff... you didn't tell me the story was that awesome. You didn't need to know. Was Alyssa with her father when that tribe took him? Ya. But she's blocked it from her mind... if I can only get her to remember... it's the difference between a best- seller and movie based on the best-seller. Who's going to play me? Well if things works out, you can play yourself. Cool. Oh, that reminds me to get that egghead Jess on our side. I'll have my lawyer to hire her as a researcher; and have her sign away her rights. Sure, see, every things good. All this pretend teacher stuff is paying off! Ya, This book about Alyssa's father is going to make me a lot of money. Hey, Us. Ok... us... Ya right! like I said. We all will get are's . Hmm.. Bryce... You're going to have to sleep in your room tonight. If you don't kill Bryce, I will. Bryce and Marcie are in there. We think they've been drinking. Alcohol. And they broke something. Got it... just go to bed, you too. I'll handle this. OK. Cause they're underage and it's against school rules, to drink especially on any kind of school related function. Jess, I get it. Just go. Shhh... be quiet... I am... but the drawer broke... What are you two doing? Umm.. My dad keeps a bottle in the Cabinet... but it was locked... so I broke it... want a swig. It's so good... Go to bed, both of you. Uh-oh... she's mad... Oh and You can forget about going on the trip tomorrow too. Oh, no... I might not get into college... except for all my dad's money. Crap... Go to bed... we'll talk about what I'm going to tell your dad Principal Washington later! Aww, Oh no!! Ok, come on.. Come on, Bryce... Oh, Your no fun! Just Go! Hey Alyssa... I made some coffee. I figured you could use it after last night. You are a lifesaver. I spoke with Marcie and Bryce. They're going to be sleeping off last night for awhile. I'm sorry I have to leave them here. It's OK. You have my cell phone number just in case? Right ? Ya. It's OK. Have fun. You know Alyssa, you're the only one I can really relax with here... I mean I know its kind of weird to say, but you really remind me of myself when I was your age. Really? Ya I mean I don't like to talk about it in front of the other kids, but I've had my bad times too. I didn't know. Well... I look forward to getting to know each other better. Sound good? It does. Great I got to go. Uh well we will be back sometime this afternoon. Just Takeit easy. Thanks, Ms. Vansen. I told you, call me Pamela. Thanks, Pamela. Marcie... Marcie get up. The car's leaving with everyone else on their stupid ocean trip. So... can't we just sleep? I Thought that was the whole point that we broke into the cabinet last night. Yeah, sure, but Alyssa's here too. And I want to have a little fun before they get back. What kind of fun? You know! Hey, Alyssa. Hi, Bryce... Where's Marcie? Asleep, I guess. I just wanted to get to know you a little better, since we're both stuck here. Why? Cause, you seem cool, I'm a little hungover, I don't know. I thought you always hated me. Oh... no. I'm sorry. I'm a jerk to everyone I like. Ask Marcie. I mean, I can be a nice guy. And you're a nice girl, right? I guess. Of course you are. A pretty one too. You're just making fun of me. Again. Look, I like you, Alyssa. There, I said it. If I wasn't nice to you, it's because I don't know how to act around someone I really like. And you don't have to believe me, but I'm a man, and all I've got is my word. You're pretty. And if you don't want me, that's OK, it's my own fault. Bryce, wait... What? I... like you too. You do? Ya... I think you're handsome. Go on. I watch you sometimes, when you're playing football. Nice!!! I think You're hot... I'm sorry I shouldn't have said anything. No, Alyssa, I'm glad we're talking. I have a confession, I love you, and want you. You do? Of course I do, you're beautiful. Don't you love me? I guess. Tell me. I... love you, Bryce. Oh my god.. That was so awesome, Bryce... I can't wait to upload this. Stupid Alyssa... Stupid... SCREAMS. It's good to finally be back... ...I hope you all had a good day. It was wonderful... I'm so glad it was just us three. So much more rewarding. Yes, thanks Ms. Vansen. It was fun. Ya, Fun... but man, I need to take a shower. Well, you guys just relax , I'll see about getting some food delivered. Tyler? Alyssa? Dammit. Bryce? Marcie? Alyssa? Are you OK? I'm sorry... I didn't mean to scare you. I... I was having a dream... a nightmare... I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. Do you happen to know Where Bryce and Marcie went too ? They were here earlier... but... But what? I can't remember. I. must've been asleep for awhile. Great... they must have took off. This is just fantastic. I shouldn't have left them here alone. I'm sure they'll come back... I mean... you're not going to be in trouble are you? Just A little bit, Alyssa... well, I'm sure it'll work out. Are you hungry? No... I'm feeling kind of full. OK... I'm going to get the others sorted out. Come down when you feel like. Ok I can't wait to upload this. Stupid Alyssa... Stupid Alyssa... Tyler, You are so good... I can't believe you're not on the swim team. I know! Yeah... but there's some other extracurricular activities I like better. Like Bryce and Marcie? I can't believe they just left like that. Oh, I can. Alyssa! Alyssa! Alyssa! Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you. You didn't... well, OK, you did. It's OK, Denny, we quiet ones have to stick together. Yeah... we do... Thanks. Is everything OK? Just trying to find out where Bryce and Marcie went off to, without raising too many red flags. Not having too good a job of it. Oh, I'm sorry. I really am. I'm sure things will work out. You seem to be in a good mood. You look better too. You know... I am. I feel... kind of energized. Wow, I'm really glad to hear it, Alyssa, I really am. And I remembered something... Like What? I was there when my dad disappeared... I mean, that's what the papers said. But I didn't remember it... until now. That's wonderful... I mean, the memories... they'll help you a lot as you find yourself. Thank you so much, for helping me. That's great, Alyssa... So what else do you remember? A shark. A Great White. A big one. Really? Wow. do you remember exactly what happened? No, not yet... just that this shark is powerful... and hungry for food and for... I don't know... I'm sorry. It's ok it will come to you, don't worry. I know... but I feel like it's so close... it's just under the surface, waiting to come out. I'm sure it is. Just give it time. I'm going to make a few more calls. Why don't you see what the others are doing? Ok! Can you hand me a towel? Of course. I had a good time with you, out on the ocean. Me too. I couldn't help thinking, you might like to get a taste. A taste? You know what I'm talking about. I know you're all smart and nerdy, but you also dig me. That's hot. It is? Sure. Especially if you might do some things. What kind of things? Oh, I have a list, don't worry. So, think about what I said. Might be fun to do a few things with you. You're like a shark... How so? When you smell blood, you don't quit. True... see, I knew there was a reason I liked you. I like what you said. About what? About Tyler being a predator... he is you know. Yes... but I want to feel good... and he might love me. Oh, I'm sure he does... That was so awesome, Bryce... I can't wait to upload this. Stupid Alyssa... Stupid Alyssa... Ms. Vansen.. Can I talk to you? Can it wait? I have things I have to get done. But... Tyler, dammit! I've got to get my publisher on the phone. Do it later! I can't...Alyssa is remembering what happened to her dad. She's going to tell me, I know it. She trusts me...this is it. So what's the hurry? Those other idiot kids disappearing act is going to get me fired. I have to advantage of her loose lips. I'd like to take advantage of your ... Oh, just stow it already. the only reason we're here is Prying that story out of Alyssa. Come on, don't be that way... I'm not going to let you hurt her... you bitch. Alyssa. I need to talk to you. OK. I overheard something... I... don't know where to start. I know... you have powers or something. I saw the video on Marcie's phone. I don't know what your talking about! I really don't... I'm scared. Don't be. I'll help you figure out whatever it is. Together. But you have to know, whatever you think Pamela is doing for you, she's a liar. She's my friend. She's not. She brought you here on purpose, to write a book about your dad She only wants to use you. No... she's been nice... Of course she has, to earn your trust. She's sleeping with Tyler. What? She wants to sell your story to the highest bidder. She set up this entire weekend to try to get those memories out of you, no matter how painful it is. Pamela wouldn't do that... Think about it. Ever since she Came to our school, it's been to get close to you and to get you to open up about your life. She was always nice... I got'A's'... Of course you did. And I'm sure she said I was lost and lonely at your age too. But trust me, I heard Pamela and Tyler... they're already planning the book tour and the swanky hotels they're going to stay at. That's... awful... I know. Pamela doesn't care about you. I'm sorry, but it's true. But I do. You do? I love you. And I'd do anything to protect you, you have to know that. I loved you since the moment I saw you. I know, Denny... I always knew. I saw you looking at me all those times in class.... Yes. And you'll help me find out about my past... and whatever is happening to me? Of course I will. I love you and would do anything for you. Oh, Alyssa... I've dreamed of this. Let's go upstairs. Yes... Alyssa, Alyssa... what are you...? What the hell was that? We're in a mansion full of horny teenagers with little supervision; I can only imagine. Maybe Marcie and Bryce are back. Who cares at this point. That's my agent... take a hike. It's your world. Hey, Jerry, what's going on. I've made a breakthrough with Alyssa... yeah... we're going to have a helluva story... Hey, Alyssa. Tyler. You seem... different. How so? I don't know... there's something... sexy about you. There's wasn't anything sexy about me before? Well... maybe... How about I show you sexy? OK... I'm going to open up and say 'ahh...' Sounds good. Alyssa? Tyler? Marcie! ALYSSA! Is anyone here? BRYCE! MARCIE! Alyssa? Alyssa? Alyssa? We should talk some more... about what happened... Alyssa, please. Talk to me. What do you want to know? I remember everything. Is that Tyler in the pool? What did you do to him? My father was killed by the tribe down in Mexico. The one that worshipped the Great White. And they cursed me. How...? They put this necklace on me. It's made with one of the shark's teeth and cursed with blood from my father. What's it do? It changes me. When I'm excited... it changes me. How? My dad used to say when there was blood in the water, there was no hope. He was right. You really want to know, Pamela? ...no... But you do. Don't you? Well...yes... I'll show you. But first... kiss me.
