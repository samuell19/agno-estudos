The day has come When we dream of foreign lands Here where we live Is far too small, I'm told The day has come When we head for foreign lands And soon we'll ask What will the future hold A white ship sets sail for Hong Kong And I long for those distant places But once I reach foreign seashores I long to return home So I tell the wind and white clouds Take me with you where you're going I would gladly trade those new lands Just to be right back at home The day has come When we live in foreign lands And feel like we're Abandoned and alone A white ship sets sail for Hong Kong And I long for those distant places But once I reach foreign seashores I long to return home So I tell the wind and white clouds Take me with you where you're going I would gladly trade those new lands Just to be right back at home A FILM BY RAINER WERNER FASSBINDER FOR ALEXANDER KLUGE He who has no house shall not build one. He who is alone shall long remain so - Why do you only read me sad poems? Poetry is always sad. And why's that? Why can't it be funny for once? Because a poem comes from the soul. And the soul is sad. Is it? And why is that? Nitwit. Because the soul knows more than the mind. - That's why it's sad. - Strange. For me, it's the other way around. For me, the mind knows more than the soul. Zip this up, would you? Schuckert? Oh, hello, Mayor. Keep quiet. You idiot. The entire city doesn't have to know every time I come here. They know anyway. Well, they don't have to know every time. Besides, it's not that often. It doesn't matter anyway. Who's it going to be this time? Gigi? Of course. Tell her I'll be waiting upstairs. Hello, Esslin. Come in. We're all equals here. I would never want to be your equal. That's a wish that will surely be fulfilled. So, you want to face your new boss with clean hands. Has he arrived yet, your Mr. von Bohm? He's not my Mr. von Bohm. He's not even your Mr. von Bohm. At least not yet. And the first thing I'm going to do is let him know your role in this city. You do that, Esslin. Otherwise, I'll have to tell him everything myself. So give my best regards to the new building commissioner. Evening, Mr. Schuckert. Evening, Harry. So, Ren√©, did you hear everything? I never hear what I'm not supposed to, Mr. Schuckert. I would never do that. Never. Well, as long as you're here, aren't you going to go? Or are you afraid of even showing your underpants in here? Thanks. Are you staying? Yeah. Maybe I should wash my hands, too. Lola will be glad to see me with clean hands, don't you think? Your hands will never be clean, no matter how often you wash. Hear how your people treat me? Can't you get them to have a little respect for the free market? That day when the rain first came So long awaited As if fated On the fields so dusty On the forests so thirsty I keep my money at the postal bank. I don't know if that's such a good idea. Our interest rates - Interest! Shall I tell you why I keep my money there? Because no one knows me there. The people there earn so little that it's out of the question that they know me. Well, a very high-ranking figure knows you here, and he's waiting in your room. I know only high-ranking figures. But only one mayor. Who can only come so late! Good things are worth waiting for, as they say. You've got it, Witty - Er, Wittich. Now get lost. We should get together next week. I've got a few ideas about the financing for the Lindenhof. You're getting ahead of yourself. Don't you want to see what the new guy is planning first? I'd rather he sees what I'm planning. There's always room to fall back later. That piques my curiosity. - You'll come to see me? - I always go where the money is. So long awaited As if fated On the fields so dusty On the forests so thirsty That day when the rain first came Left and right Day and night When the bells started ringing And of love they were singing Then you came That looks awful. You should never have given them permission. In a democracy, you have to permit all sorts of things. - It looks horrible. - Your Esslin is in there. Do you know one of them? A little employee of the city planning department. Totally unimportant. Is he even allowed to demonstrate? - He's a moralist. - Aren't we all? But we don't have to demonstrate. And in front of the church, too. We needn't pay any attention to this riffraff. - Come on. - Just a minute. Esslin, for the fight against war. - Thank you. Here. - No, thanks. So, Schuckert, what was that about? I make a contribution here. I give something there. A man of free enterprise should have fingers in many pies. He's a fine man. A proud man. He reminds me of your father. - He was probably an officer too. - A sergeant. Yes, your father was a sergeant. But he would have become an officer if he hadn't been killed. If Father was still alive - Yes, if Father was still alive, I wouldn't need to work as a housekeeper. - Nor would you as a - - Singer. Right. A singer. What was I saying? You always confuse me. What's his name, anyway? The new building commissioner you're working for. Von Bohm. Baltic. Or maybe Latvian? Masurian? Definitely not Masurian. I would have known the name. But a good family. You can smell it. - Smell? - That's right, smell. Even if you make fun of it. And if you want to know the truth... I can see him on a horse. Very clearly, in fact. And he's also well mannered. How do you know all this? You spoke to him for a half hour at the most. A half hour often says more about a person than an entire lifetime. He gave me the housekeeping money in advance. So generous. And he said I can bring along little Marie, as long as she doesn't disturb him. How old is he? In his prime, I'd say. Simply a splendid man. Then why doesn't he have a wife? Building commissioner's office, please. There's no point. What's that supposed to mean? There's no point. He's been dead a long time now. I'd suggest you give precise answers to precise questions. Ground floor, turn right, first door on the left. - Number six. - Thank you. By the way: von Bohm. I'm the new building commissioner. There's no one in yet. Don't you have anything better to do? The reception doesn't start until 11:00. The reception starts at 11:00. Work starts at 8:00. Right? The reception starts at 11:00. Work starts at 8:00. - Right? - Right. Good morning, Mrs. - Miss Hettich. Miss. Good morning, Miss Hettich. Good morning, Mr. von Bohm. After the weekend, the first thing I always do is water plants. Very good. Miss Hettich? I frightened you, didn't I? I apologize. I promise never to frighten you again. You know how you can help me do that? By always being here one minute earlier than me. One minute earlier. I arrive at 8:00. Agreed? Agreed. If you could clear away these things... I've emptied out the drawers. But you might still have a use for one or another of these things. No, neither for one or another. I'd like to make a new beginning, so to speak. A new beginning. Please have the pictures taken down and the plants taken away. You don't like plants? I like plants, but not in the office. I also like pictures, by the way, but not these. I'd rather have a display rail. A display rail? One of those things for displaying plans. That's what this office is for: making plans. Right? And now I'd like the newspapers. Of course. Newspapers. The errand boy usually comes around 9:00. Is that so? Then please see to it that from now on he delivers at 8:00. - Isn't that a good idea? - You mean I should see to it that from now on he delivers at 8:00? That's an excellent idea, Mr. von Bohm. The reconstruction of this city, gentlemen - sorry: ladies and gentlemen - will not be completed for some time. The wounds opened in our community by the war have yet to heal. Some houses in our streets have yet to be rebuilt. But we can already see newer, wider-reaching tasks. The economic miracle of our social market economy has unleashed forces that go far beyond the old ways, literally creating new ground. We, the planning department and building control office, have the task of supporting these expansive forces. This country, here and now, requires from us construction and expansion. That is the mission that will guide us. We must do our best to allow progress to move forward for the benefit of all. In the course of this work, I'll get to know you, and you'll get to know me. Let's drink to that! I was relatively certain I'd made a good choice in you. - Now I'm entirely certain. - Thank you. What you just said was very fine, about how the authorities should not put on the brakes. Mid-level civil servants need a director who tells them, "I know how to interpret the laws narrowly-mindedly. You show me how to make use of them generously." You understand? We have too many so-called "conscientious civil servants." I have nothing against conscientious civil servants. - Don't get me wrong. - Heaven forbid! The sense of duty, so to speak - we're in complete agreement about that. But the other part, about not getting lost in the fine print and seeing the big picture, that's what we need so badly. Our Mr. Esslin will make sure you meet all the gentlemen. He's the right man for that job, isn't he? - Glad to, Mr. Mayor. - And don't let yourself get intoxi - - What's the word, Esslin? - Indoctrinated? Right. Don't let him do that. He can be dangerous. And as they say, "We'll get to know each other on the job." Our new man sounds very reasonable. Perhaps it would be most useful to get to know this gentleman first. Schuckert? You won't be able to avoid it. That sounds ominous, the way you put it. Schuckert is a building contractor. The building contractor around here. Then it definitely seems important to get to know him. - After all, we do deal with construction. - At least I have a good feeling. How can we do our job without building contractors, especially capable ones? Sounds good to me, this von Bohm. He's very capable. As am I. At least, I hope so. Could you please introduce me to the other gentlemen? I'll see to that. This is our chief of police, Mr. Timmerding. Pleased to meet you. I'll be at your side at all times to protect your activities. I hope my activities will not require police protection. Human nature, Mr. von Bohm - Do we know human nature? - Satisfied? - I think so. Schuckert should be especially satisfied. - Here, Esslin. - No, thanks. - I would not see things so narrowly. - Sleep well? I always sleep well, Mr. Schuckert. Do you come from East Prussia, if I may ask? How did you know that? I probably should have told you when we first met: I have two secret weaknesses that will come to light sooner or later: People from East Prussia and tea from West Frisia. I come from Trakenow, near Danzig. I passed through Danzig once during the war. But we were in retreat, so we were somewhat rushed. Was your husband lost in the war? Stalingrad. Now we've had over ten years of peace. God grant it may last our whole life. You're a good person. Marie, you must stay in the kitchen! That's okay. She's more carefree than either of us. Little Marie. Shall I tell you a joke? An old lady is going to church. She meets a man and he says, "Where are you going?" "I'm going to church." "To church?" "That's right, to church." "No, that's not possible." "Why not?" "Because you have a chunk of salt pork under your arm." "I don't have any salt pork under my arm. I'm going to church. I don't need any salt pork - Oh, my God! Then I must have thrown the prayer book into the pea soup!" That was dumb. That was dumb, huh? Yes, I suppose it was. Marie, are you also an East Prussian? No, I'm a girl. And you? Me? - I'm a man. - Then you can marry me. - Maybe later. - Then I'll get married by myself. Marie! I don't know where she comes up with these things. Don't worry about her. I like children. They're so self-confident. Would you like to give me your instructions now? What instructions? What you would like for lunch. What I should buy for the weekend. Those sorts of things. Mrs. Kummer, I don't plan to give you any instructions. Outside this apartment, I do nothing but give instructions, from morning till night, the whole week long. Here you give the instructions, please. I'm entitled to place myself in your hands. You understand? I'm asking you to take care of me. She'll take care of you too, right? What does your daughter do, anyway? My daughter? She's a singer. A singer? How nice. Classical? Or modern? Classical. Actually rather classical. And she's usually away on tour. If I like someone, I like to tell him so. But if I don't like someone, I don't like to let him know. And why do you like me, Madame Fink? Because you buy so much of her champagne. The others booze it up, too. But Mr. Schuckert has a zest for life. That's why I like him. He boozes it up when things are going well. The others booze it up when they're not. You've got it! Then I'd also like another glass... because things aren't going well. What's wrong? I have to listen to your zest-for-life stories. That's what you're paid for, so just listen, because - - You know that big shot - - The little guy. His predecessor, Kleinermans, who I was always having trouble with - because of height limits? - No, I don't know. Well, it doesn't matter. I always snuck an extra floor by him... by sinking the basement a foot and a half deeper. Do you think the old fool ever noticed? But von Bohm, that shrewd dog. He's very modern. He looks right at the plans and says, "Why did you make the basement so deep?" He picked up on it right away. And I think, "Schuckert, now you're screwed." I start blathering on, and he just fixes me coldly. - And you know what he says? - I don't know. Doesn't matter. He says, "Why don't you just go three stories higher and spare yourself this strange idea of deepening the basement?" I can't believe my ears. You know what that means? I don't know! Doesn't matter. Plaisir d 'amour Happiness lasts but an instant I'll explain it to you, my dear. Three stories higher means three million more marks. Can you imagine? Bring your new friend along sometime. Here? You're nuts. I don't know. He'll never come here. Why? Is he a homo? What? That's a good one! Von Bohm, a homo! Von Bomo! No, he's old-fashioned, that's all. How's that? You just said he's modern. He's also modern. Modern on the job, old-fashioned in his private life. Old school. Kissing hands and the like. Doesn't think about screwing, and definitely not in a whorehouse. Oh, sorry. I mean, he's just not the man for someone like you. Kissing hands? What would you say... if he kissed the hand of someone like me? Nothing. He never would. Want to bet? He'd never do it. Champagne! Thirty bottles! It's a bet. Thirty bottles of bubbly for a kiss on the hand in front of witnesses. What do you want here? - Down with imperialism! - No war! Never again! Get out of here! Take it outside! Get out of here, all of you! Tell me, good Esslin Why can't someone build As many stories as he likes? What? Stories? Stories. I said it very clearly. Because there are zoning ordinances, and because regulations dictate the number of stories allowed on a property. I see. Why can Schuckert build three stories higher at Lindenhof? Build higher? Aren't there zoning org - zoning orb - zoning thingamajigs! Why are you interested in that? Why not? Is it forbidden... for someone like me... to be interested in zoning orb - zoning org - zoning stuff? Just tell me that! Because von Bohm said that the zoning ordinance - Zoning ordinance! ...must be changed, that's all. That's all! Do you still like your von Bohm? Now that he allows Schuckert three floors - one, two... three more floors? He's impressive somehow. Captivating. In any case, he's not corrupt. Modern. Old-fashioned. You know what? That guy gets on my nerves. - You don't even know him. - Exactly. Lola, he's no man for you. He's no man for me! Well, maybe... I'm a woman for him! Why doesn't anyone say that? And to ensure that the German soldier is no longer mistaken for the few actual National Socialists, the city of Coburg has decided to dedicate a monument to the German Armed Forces, the German resistance, and especially to the memory of Colonel Claus Schenk, Count von Stauffenberg. Are you Mr. von Bohm? AGAINST REARMAMENT WWI - 9,200,000 DEAD WWII - 55,000,000 DEAD Fine. You're not his cleaning lady. You're his housekeeper. I just want to see how you keep his house. But you've never visited me anywhere else before. You've never swept floors for such a fine man before. Please! Kept house. Who knows? Maybe it'll have a good influence on me to see how other people live. Please don't touch anything. Just once I'd like to know why the whole world thinks I'm a leper. Even my own mother. Marie-Louise, please. It's very valuable. This? It's called Ming and it's from China. He even reads books about it. Every Wednesday he gets new ones from the library. Leave that alone! What for? He's got plenty more. Marie! If you hang around here all day, you'll soon be smarter than your mother. Ming! Ming! You see? Does he ever read anything else? Romances or stuff like that? Naturally he does not. Doesn't seem so natural to me. Seems unnatural. How do you know all this? I just know it. So you've been spying. Marie, what will become of you? Your Grandma's a cleaning lady and a spy, your mother's a leprous whore, and your father is a bastard with a zest for life. What's a whore? Marie-Louise! A whore is something for sale, like that Ming thing there. Except you can touch them, and they're not so rare. What are you doing here? He lives here. He's a Negro. - I can see that. - Besides, he only speaks English. What's that supposed to mean? How do you know how good my English is? And I speak a little German. Good day. How are you? He used to occupy the whole house. Imagine that! Very interesting. Now another old man lives here too. He works as a blind beggar in the market square. Get this: He's not even blind! And this is his bedroom. His bedroom. Hello, Mr. von Bohm. I've been expecting you. I'll mark these as returned. - You already know the way. - Yes, I do. Pardon me. Haven't we met somewhere before? Indirectly. I see you're interested in East Asian art. Indirectly. I don't understand. Directly - Directly, I'm very interested in you. Good morning, Mr. von Bohm. Good morning, my dear Miss Hettich. Tulips, lilacs, and narcissus are for pretty girls, whether miss or missus. For me? Is there some other pretty woman here? Thank you. It's a splendid day today. - But it's drizzling. - So? It's still a splendid day. A day is judged not by how it looks, but by how one feels. The newspapers. Which has reason to stay longer, tea or coffee? Coffee. The coffee has good grounds. The tea always leaves. Did I already tell you that one? The very first week. I'll have to be more careful with my little jokes. So, what do we have? At 9:30 you meet with Mayor V√©lker. You have a 1:00 appointment at the Golden Lion with the traffic department. And at 3:00, the construction committee meeting. First get me Esslin. Who is the second cup for? For Mr. Esslin. I thought - I've got to hand it to you. You learn very, very quickly. - I've been waiting. - I thought - No interruptions, please. Von Bohm's office. Hettich speaking. A matter of life and death. Personal call for you - from a lady. Give it here. "I took a good long look at you And found you altogether nice I listened to you long and hard And found you very erudite Your words were wise, I saw this You smelled so good, quite flawless Compared with others, you have more soul So how 'bout Sunday for a stroll?" Yes? Good. As you heard, it was a matter of life and death. No more calls, please. I assume you're prepared? Yes, I am. Have some tea and then begin. First, the Lindenhof project. Give me your honest opinion without the slightest hint of fear or manipulation. Please be frank and honest. Thank you. The Lindenhof project is a conspiracy. A conspiracy? Interesting. Let me hear your proof. First, the land registry abstracts. Excepting inheritance, no significant change of ownership had taken place since the turn of the century. But in the last five years, transfers have increased dramatically. I know several of the new owners. They're the power elite of the city. Very nice. Power elite. Secondly, property prices. They're now triple the 1952 prices and ten times those of 1938. When the new construction plan goes into effect, profit from speculation will at least double again. Thirdly, the construction committee. Its membership is an amalgamation of the city's so-called "good families." Do you have a list? Not on that point. But you'll be sitting across from the gentlemen this afternoon. That I will. Anything else? What? Proof of conspiracy. How does Schuckert fit into this? You know, if the others are circling, waiting crows... he's a bird of prey. That's what he is. Power elite. Profit from speculation. Amalgamation. Bird of prey. And what about me? HOW do I fit into all this? What do you expect from me? I expect you to impose order. To clean up these - That I scatter the crows and forbid the bird of prey to hunt. Is that what you mean? Do you want to revolutionize our economic system? I reject revolution. I'm a humanist. You reject revolution. You're a humanist. Then you'll have to put up with crows and birds of prey. POWER ELITE. SPECULATION PROFIT. AMALGAMATION. BIRD OF PREY. It's ingenious what that shrewd bastard has done. Simply ingenious. Why do you keep calling him a bastard? Do I ? You're right. He's more of a fox. A sly, cunning fox. And he said I was an eagle! A what? I don't know exactly. I wasn't there. But he definitely said something about a bird circling over the city, a bird of prey, and Timmerding says he meant me. Not bad. He called the others ravens or crows or something. So he said you're all a bunch of pigs. Slimeballs! The scum of the earth. Well, not quite that far. But in principle, yes. Something like that. I agree with him completely. I don't understand why you think that's a good thing. But I do understand this: A greedy pig like you is even happy to be called a pig. - It's fine. - You touch it, it's a move. But that tight-ass Timmerding, and your pretty pal from the bank. - Wittich? - Yeah, him. That they'd let him say those things about them. - I don't get it. - Then let me explain, young lady. It's because you have the sweetest ass in all of NATO. Do I? First they wanted to beat him to death, according to Timmerding. But then they understood what he was getting at. He wants apartments built, of course. But he can't build them himself, because he's just a little planning official. So he needs the pack of pigs and the slimeballs. You see? It's ingenious, and forward-thinking too. He knows what progress is. He ought to get the Wartime Medal of- I mean the Distinguished Service Medal. You can put him on your payroll. No, he'd never allow it. Not that guy. But you're right. He needs to be recognized somehow. You could give him... a chunk of your ass. He could make a pork chop out of it. That's a good one! I have to tell Viilker! A chunk of my - I've got it. Come here. I'll give him a piece of your ass. He gets one night with you. Come here. You really are a pig. His words were "bird of prey." On second thought, maybe that's not such a good idea. He doesn't even go to the whorehouse. I'll think of something else. Here. Tell little Marie something good about her father. Before Mr. Building Commissioner tells her what he thinks of me! But he certainly doesn't speak to illegitimate children. If he knew what you're really like... he wouldn't have said "bird of prey." He'd have said "vulture." A very useful bird. Mrs. Kummer, could you come here for a moment? Did you call me? No, Grandpa Berger. I called Mrs. Kummer. How do I look? I bought a new suit. I see. And what's the new suit for? For strolling. It's a sport suit. I told them I wanted something a little sporty. That it is. It's definitely sporty. It's the finest English fabric. - The cut also looks very English. - Doesn't it? It's definitely very practical for strolling. Be frank with me. You don't like it. I wouldn't say that. It's just that you look so different. Different from what? From the usual. Very good. That's how it should be, because today's different from usual too. A man has many faces. His everyday face, his Sunday face - Today I don't want to look everyday. Tell me, how old do you take me to be? Forty-five. No, not how old I am, but how old you take me to be. Oh, definitely younger. Much younger than you look. You see? Clothes make the man. If I may ask, this lady - What lady? I didn't say anything about a lady. Then this person with whom you're strolling - is this person young? Much younger than I could probably ever look. Evening gently lowers its veil Just the lovely nightingale Sings its song all along Hill and dale Thank you. For what? I haven't sung for so long. So beautifully. Neither have I. After singing a round, you get to make a wish, because that's when the heart is totally open. You're not allowed to breathe. Wish really hard! It will come true. I promise you. Don't look back, or else it's all for nothing. You're very good at magic. Only for easy things. The harder ones I have to make come true myself. Watch your step. Did you love your wife very much? I don't really know. Perhaps. I came back from the war and told myself, "That's the woman I really love. Otherwise I wouldn't have married her." But I didn't feel love. It was just, how should I put it... like a memory of love. Do you understand? I think I understand you very well. But then - Then she told me there was someone else. Then, for the first time since being back, I really felt something. Not love, but pain. I was thankful to my wife for teaching me how to feel again... even if it was pain. And then? The world was filled with unrest during those weeks. In certain places on Earth, changes took place on a grand scale. This city isn't for you. You should move on. Anywhere. Just don't stay here. But I've only just arrived. How can this city be bad, if it's good for you? The people here have a private life and a public life, and the two have nothing to do with each other. That's completely normal. I too have a private and a public life. But you don't pretend to be what you're not. Well, maybe a little tiny bit. For instance? Your suit, for instance. I like you better the way you usually dress. You don't like my suit. No, it's nice... but it's a fake. Your other suits are more genuine. They don't hide what kind of person you are. Now I need a smoke too. What kind of person am I? I don't know. Maybe one day I'll find out. But I know what you're not: You're not a fraud or a fake. You're just not corrupt. And that's why you don't belong in this city. - What about you? - Me? I'm corrupt. You most certainly are not. I adapt Same thing. But before I bare my soul to you any further, I'd better go. What a shame. The bus is coming that will take you to the city. Your city. I'll observe it very carefully during the trip. You won't discover anything. It's covered in darkness. But it's no different during the day. I don't think it's fair to leave me now... when I still know so little about you. Do you want to start a file on me? Or do you want to kiss me? Of course Gigi can wear a white dress. If a woman is going to give herself to her future husband, it doesn't matter how many times she's given herself to someone in the past. It only matters whether they counted for her. None of them counted. But they've all been accounted, right? You're just jealous, Susi. That's all. I had to save up for our gas station. That's just an excuse. And who would I be jealous of? It's not an excuse. It's the truth. That's right. That's precisely the proof that someone doesn't count, even if he's on account. Having to give herself to other men is practically unavoidable for a woman these days. And if she's still thinking about a gas station, then she's nearly out of the woods. What kind of ring did he buy? Eighteen karat? Fourteen. He really wanted 18, but I told him 14 was good enough. Staying together in sickness and in health, that's what's important. Only a jeweler can tell what kind of ring it is by looking at it. Why does there have to be a number stamped on gold? That's like buying a dress and leaving the price tag on so everyone can see how much it cost. Once the gas station gets going, Herbert says I should hire a cleaning lady, because I'll be having a baby. - And a nanny. - A housekeeper. - A maid. - A lover. She'll never find a lover where she's moving to. There aren't any lovers there. Why are you moving there? Why doesn't your Herbert move here? Because no one knows me there. Except Herbert. But if you're quitting here this month, why are you two waiting so long with the wedding? You could marry right now. Herbert wants us to wait a month so that we can get married a month later. Why exactly a month? Because a month is four weeks. What more do you want? You know exactly what I mean. Because that's what Herbert wants, and I want it too. Because then you'll be clean. Maybe. Because then she'll be clean. - Don't you think that's nice? - No. What's wrong with you? I've got a headache. That's all. Headache! Then Lola can get married in three days. Only three more days and she'll be clean. Then you can buy the salon from me, and you'll be the one making the jokes. Are you looking to sell? Right away, if you make me a good offer. No, not right away. But later... maybe. Shall I tell you a little secret now that everything is in the bag? Please. You had me worried at first. Early on in the game. First, I heard a few things about you. Then we got to know each other personally. And I said to myself, "Not with this guy. He's different." And I was right. Excuse me. I don't entirely understand. - Well, it's just that - - Excuse me. I need to - The bathroom? I'll show you. When I have a project and I need someone from the city, I invite him to lunch. Or we go out at night, booze it up and end up at the - Anyway, to have a pleasant conversation, you need the right atmosphere, right? But with you, I said right away, "He does everything at the office. One man behind the desk, the other in front. Chop-chop. No interest in all the other stuff." Right? - You've definitely formed your opinion. - So I have. And I said to myself, "Schuckert, only invite him somewhere once the whole thing is in the bag. And then he'll insist on paying his own way." Right? Not exactly. Firstly, your Lindenhof is far from "in the bag," to use your term. It is, believe me. The construction committee's just waiting for your presentation. They'll all fall in line. I've known those guys longer than you. - And secondly? - Secondly, it never crossed my mind to pay my own way. I assumed I was your guest. After all, you're the one soon to be a millionaire, not me. You're too much. I'd like a gift for a lady. What's the occasion? The occasion? Anniversary, birthday, baptism, engagement - Engagement. An engagement gift for the lady. Don't cry. It's just... because I'm so happy. A thundershower in spring. That's rare. I told you I can work magic, my dear. I have a present for you, too. When I'm ready, I'll give you a sign. Then you say "Please take a seat. Dinner is served." "Dinner is served." Very good. Just be casual and enjoy yourself until I give you the sign. Be casual. Very good. If you'd like, introduce me to her beforehand, before you present her to your guests. I don't know if she's punctual. For a man like you, any woman would be punctual. Thank you. Only because this is a matter dear to my heart... and because I've been taking care of you. And because perhaps in the future - I mean - It's exquisite the way you've set the table. You couldn't have made it more beautiful for your own daughter. I never said you could interrogate me! Is this about Gigi? About Gigi? A whore? Schuckert? Schuckert? A whoremonger? - Is it about me? - You? A nutcase? A nutcase who can't even figure out that it might be about me! Me! Now get out! - May I serve dessert now? - Please. What are we having? Rice pudding with plums. Good God. I'm full. - Dinner was so... inventive. - But good. Good? I wouldn't say that. Inventive. Piquant. Yes, one might say that. Or even "unusual." Your housekeeper is not from here, is she? No, Mrs. Kummer is from - Where was that? Trakenow. Many new dishes have come to us by way of refugees. It's a pleasant enrichment of our usual cuisine. That it is. An enrichment. But unusual - What you're not familiar with - - You don't like. No, I wouldn't say that. I found the menu very inventive. It was just a bit heavy on my stomach. This stupid stomach of mine only knows local cuisine. Then let's get your stupid stomach home to its local bed. Thank you. It tasted great to me. Well, if you must leave. In our city, one goes to bed early. So as not to get home too late. Thanks for a nice evening. - He who sleeps cannot sin. - That's how we see it. It was a sincere pleasure making your acquaintance. After all I've heard about you - - Only good things, I hope. - I'm sure your ears were ringing. But we're not leaving you completely alone now. I don't understand. Surely your housekeeper will be staying to tidy up. Come on. What have you got against the poor woman? You don't even know her. - Exactly. - Shit. The police. In line, please. And of course you're stinking drunk again. I think your lousy luck serves you right. Poor Schuckert. Quit laughing, stupid bitch! Must you draw attention to us? Besides, I had no desire to meet that woman. I didn't go to your famous Mr. von Bohm's dinner party to meet his housekeeper. In our house, the guests never caught a glimpse of the housekeeper. "In our house." That's right. At the very most, when she brought in the soup. But she would never sit next to the man of the house. Where your father's floozy was already sitting. Miss von Gerhard was the housemistress, not the housekeeper. But that's a difference you'll probably never understand. Because I'm a prole. Exactly. Because you're a prole. Unfortunately. If I know you, you'll still be going out. Absolutely. I deserve it! No reason to be so aggressive. Just don't make so much noise when you come home. A prole always makes noise when he comes home - if he comes home. Unfortunately you always do. Pull up, please. License and registration. Oh, Mr. Schuckert. I didn't recognize you at first. - You can go ahead, of course. - See? - Have a nice evening. - Thank you, Officer. Don't mention it. Drive safely. Next. - Good night. - Thank you once again. IT WAS NICE SINGING WITH YOU, BUT EVERY SONG HAS AN END. When in Capri the blood-red sun Sinks in the sea And the crescent of the pale moon Looks down with glee Then the fishermen push their boats Away from shore They know they soon must work With net and oar And the stars that smile down on them From the sky Show the way for the boats That good sailors know to ply And from boat to boat The good old song resounds Listen closely How it sounds Bella Marie I'll be back tomorrow Stay true to me Don't forget me Do you want to go right to your room? Will you give me something as a gift? Something? Everything! Not everything. Just this place here. Does it have to be right now? Later. Now I want to sleep. Esslin, she just wants to sleep. What's the story with your Herbert? Motorcycle accident. He had a skull fracture. And when he came to, he wanted nothing more to do with you? That was entirely my decision. What am I supposed to do with a guy with a busted head? - I'll be going now. - You'll be going now. Very well. It's so late. Good-bye. What is it? I was just passing by. Anything else on the schedule? This late? - I came to see if I could help you. - If you could help me? Very kind of you. But I've got to get through it alone. I see. Schuckert. Giving capital a helping hand isn't so easy. Hence the need for overtime. One man puts in overtime while another puts profits in the bank. To each his own. That's what I always say. What about you? What does the humanist do after work? I'm a member of a group against rearmament. - Is that really of any interest to you? - Very much so. I'm always intrigued by fruitless passions. In another group we're studying Bakunin. He wrote a very interesting essay on land and property. What was his conclusion? That the Earth belongs to everyone, not just a few. I don't understand. It obviously belongs to just a few, not to everyone. Does he really mean it, or is it just wishful thinking on Mr. Bakunin's part? It's reality in a higher sense. Very good. I understand. That's why we complement each other so well: You're busy with reality in a higher sense, while I'm busy with reality in a lower sense. I dream and you act. That's what you mean. You think and I function. That's what you mean. And Schuckert profits. That's what I mean. With your permission, I'll be going now. FASCISM WILL TRIUMPH Personally, I think it's good that there's one who dreams while all the others work. But you won't believe that. No. There's just one more thing I've been meaning to ask you. Do you remember the dedication at that monument? A young lady turned up. Do you know her? Have you seen her since? No. Why do you ask? Just one of those things. She had this perfume. I can't get it out of my mind. A Perfume? Yes, a perfume. Good luck with your dreaming. Best regards to Mr. Bakunin. I'll tell him. - Who are you? - Television delivery. Right at 5:00, as arranged. That is, if you don't keep me standing here any longer. Television set! Did we arrange that for today? Of course. Otherwise, I would have come tomorrow if we hadn't arranged it for today. Please put it over there. Of course. Right you are. Otherwise you would have come tomorrow or the next day. You can put it on the little table. Did you order this? Yes. It's time we had a television. Look! A broadcast! That's not a broadcast. That's just the test pattern. The broadcast doesn't start until 8:00. The broadcast doesn't start until 8:00. And what kind of broadcast is this? I just told you. It's not a broadcast. It's a test pattern. And I don't know what's on tonight. Isn't that amazing? That's just a test pattern, but at 8:00 there's a broadcast, and then you find out what's on. What's that for? You can forget that for now. That's only if there's a second channel. But right now there's only one. That would be for others. You could choose the one you liked best. In theory, like I said. What do you think of that? There might even be a second channel soon. Please sign here. - I'll show you out. - Very kind of you. Give him something for his trouble. - I'll be going, too. - Thank you very much. - Day and night. - Really? I told you to get lost. That peacenik hangs around here for hours at a time. That's none of your business. Shove off. Not until I know what's up with you. - None of your business. - It is too my business. - I pay for you. - In bed! But not here! In bed, here and everywhere! And everything! I pay for your daughter. And if your mother weren't cleaning for strangers, I'd pay for her too. Then the whole family would belong to me. Tell me, how much for an hour here in your room? Fifty marks sound good? I'll pay a hundred. Esslin, you're driving up the price. I thought you could always warm up here for free. A hundred. If you leave the room immediately. You know what? I'll buy you before you ruin yourself. Put your cigar away. What's your price? I wouldn't know what to do with you, but I presume you're cheap. And then I could at least fire you. If only Mr. von Bohm could see the two of us now, haggling over a whore. See? That's not your style. And you're out of money. Give that to your peacenik friends, not to her. She gets plenty from me. Get out! Bastards! I said bastards! Plural! Now do you understand why that broad gets me so hot? She's so high-class. You know what? I'll have her tonight, even if I have to pay double. I've always wanted to ask you: Have you ever done it with her? Do you really want to hit me? She's not worth it. Come on. Let's have a drink, man to man. And I take back what I said about peaceniks. Where are you going? What have you got in mind? I'm going to rip that mask off your face. These will always be associated with the name Erhard and the economic rules he put into practice. All products manufactured in Germany carry the invisible seal of approval of the free social market economy. Ludwig Erhard did not invent it, but he has implemented it. And he has made no secret that those who adhere to the planned economy - Evening, Esslin. What time is it? - I fell asleep in front of the TV. - It's not too late. Come with me. I want to show you our city. The cultural achievements of our people after the war are very apparent. We have succeeded in guaranteeing the security of our state with German participation within the Atlantic alliance. The citizens of our country can be proud. The Federal Republic is the one country in the world that through forward-looking activities and initiatives - Von Bohm! My God, come have a drink! Evening, Esslin. What a surprise. I knew deep down you were a real man. Come, sit down. Have a drink! Cheers! To our loves! Cheers. There's a little sinner in all of us. I knew the path would lead you here one day. Too much work makes you cranky. Leave some room for hanky-panky. - To our sins! - This is unbelievable. We're in the best of company here. - Wittich! - Come. Let's go to bed. This is absolutely unbelievable. You don't have to go upstairs. That's the best thing about this place. If you don't feel like it, stay here and have a drink and enjoy the world. Just look at me: Always can, never have to! Come now. It wasn't that funny. He's just - Ladies and gentlemen, by special request, Lola will sing for you once again "The Fishermen of Capri." Pay attention. Here comes the good part. You never would have guessed, right? Esslin is the drummer here. He doesn't do anything else, you can rest assured. Here she comes. The best broad this city has to offer. And guess who she belongs to? Me. Good old Schuckert. She's all mine! Well? Did I promise too much? There she is. My private whore. If you weren't so incorruptible, I'd even buy you a night with her. When in Capri the blood-red sun Sinks in the sea And the crescent of the pale moon Looks down with glee Then the fishermen push their boats Away from shore They know they soon must work With net and oar And the stars that smile down on them From the sky Show the way for the boats That good sailors know to ply And from boat to boat The good old song resounds Listen closely How it sounds Bella Marie I'll be back tomorrow, be true to me Don't forget me See the light appear Out upon the sea Distant and unclear So far from the pier What in the world could it be Do you know what's there Floating through the air Hundreds of those fishermen Whose song rings everywhere Good morning, Mr. Thiele. Wake up! - Flowers for your boss? - Pretty, aren't they? You're going to need those today. He's already here. What? For God's sake, it's only three minutes to 8:00. When I came on, he was already in. Who knows? Perhaps he spent the whole night here. Good morning, Mr. von Bohm. Where are you? Ah, MS. Hettich. One minute before 8:00, like clockwork. Good Lord. What have you done? I don't know. But I desperately needed a set of documents. We don't want to go to the meeting unprepared. But your presentation went out weeks ago. Perhaps the gentlemen still have questions for me, or maybe I have questions for them. And I can't make tea as well as you. I'll make a fresh pot. That would be nice. But first get Esslin for me. Tell him it's a matter of life and death. - Aren't the flowers for me? - Yes. - I'll put them in a vase at once. - No, bring them here. I want to feel the present up close. It's so rare that a man gets flowers from a lady. Good morning. You know this one? "She loves me. She loves me not." Well, we don't want to tempt fate. When do I have to be at the city council? The gentlemen expect you at 10:30. Good. The gentlemen expect me at 10:30. Then I'd better get a shave for the gentlemen. Get me an appointment with the city council - uh, the barber. I'm all mixed up. And... could you buy me a shirt? A nice white shirt, to avoid embarrassment. But first I have calls to make. The registrar's office, the recorder's office, and the legal department, in that order. The director of each. Registrar's office. Recorder's office. Legal department. Director of each. The directors directly, shortly the shirt. You can remember it that way. Just a minute. Where is it? "It is in the hours between night and day when the decision to revolt is made. From out of the dawn the bird rises up in rebellion... and flies toward the rising sun." Bakunin? No, me! Tell me, Esslin, do you want to be my accomplice? We now come to point three of the agenda: the Lindenhof project. I don't want to anticipate the results of the vote, but I just want to say thank you to our building commissioner, Mr. von Bohm, for his selfless, generous, dynamic and forward-thinking handling of this, the largest construction project in the history of our city. I can confidently say Mr. von Bohm has rendered outstanding service to the future of this city. I trust you sense the agreement with which your presentation has been met. If you'd like to say something, I'll gladly give you the floor. Thank you. In consideration of prevailing building codes, I am unfortunately compelled to withdraw the proposal. I will draw up a legally safer proposal in due time. He declared war on them. Oh, man! It's like that crazy guy with the windmills, the one on the horse. The one called "Quiche" or something like that. Don Quixote. And you're the fool that runs after him. He's serious. And I'm going to help him. That's the funny part. Would you want to live in a world that has lost all morality? Where there's only evil and depravity and corruption? Gladly. My only problem is... they never let me really join in. He hasn't been the same since he went to the whorehouse. We all go to the whorehouse. That's no explanation. But he's a damned moralist. And you hired him. He had good references. References! Do you know how much his references are costing me? Three million. And that's a conservative estimate. All the morality in the world wouldn't cost you three million. You were impressed with him yourself. So I was. You said he had class. - Those were your exact words. - So I did. And so I would again. Think he could have screwed us over like this if he didn't have class? - What can I do now? - Who's the mayor, you or me? I don't know - do something! Maybe I could somehow get... the public safety office to shut down the whorehouse. He has nothing against us having a whorehouse. He doesn't care about the whorehouse itself. He has something against us for going there. Something along those lines. I don't know. I can't just fire him. If he wants to withdraw his presentation, he's well within his rights. - The man's mind is as sharp as a razor. - That's the problem. If you ask me, he's just the sensitive type. You're contradicting yourself. The best thing would be for you to go and talk with him, man to man. Tell him you know he's a man of class, and so on. Then maybe we'll find out what's really behind all this. That's a heavy load you're carrying. Evidence of your guilt. That's not the way to go about this. We should have a little talk. Should we? I wouldn't know what about. What you're planning affects the public at large. Please let me pass. There must be a way. I'll tell you what I'm planning. I'm going to destroy you. Destroy and annihilate you! All of you, and your whores too! That's what I'm planning. He's lost his marbles. So, that's the last three years. Some tea? Any construction order carried out by the Schuckert Company, or involving them in any way, or if any of the men or companies on this list are mentioned in connection with the construction project, then mark it like you did with the other three years. Shall I make you some tea? Pass the files that you've gone through to Mr. Esslin right away. Yes, tea. That would be good. Calms the nerves. Hello. Daily News? I'd like to speak to Mr. Weizmann. The Mr. Weizmann in charge of local news. Mr. Weizmann, this is von Bohm, building commissioner. I'd like to speak with you. I have evidence against Schuckert. It will ruin him. It will destroy him. Where? Tomorrow at 4:00 at the La Luna Bar. Good. Well? You promised me a scandal, but you brought me contracts. Of course I brought you contracts. You think the devil nowadays still stinks of sulfur and has a hairy tail? - No, I don't. - Well, then! He's put on sweet perfume and clothed himself in the finest cloth, but his horrible goals remain the same. This is a pact, a plot, a conspiracy. Call it a contract if you like. This plot... that you speak of- what do you think are its goals? Now we're getting somewhere. You ask about goals. I ask: Cui bono? - What? - Cui bono? Who benefits from it? Look at the names in the contracts and you'll have your answer. They're all respected citizens of this city. Respected citizens? It's the power elite. The ruling class. I consulted an expert in social theory before coming to see you. But the question about goals still stands. What goals could the ruling class be pursuing? The goal of getting rich. But that's why contracts are signed. But at whose cost? I'll tell you. At the cost of the poor. Those without rights. The exploited. They get something out of it, too. If one person gets rich, the others get rich, too. Maybe not exactly rich, but they're not as poor as they were before. That's why we call our market economy a social one: because there's something in it for everyone. Those are the rules of the game. Understand? Yes, I understand. The rules of the game. That's what I told my adviser: that the rules of the game have to be changed. I won't allow you to destroy yourself. You can't stop me. Would you stand in someone's way who has discovered the truth? The whole is rotten, not just parts, so the whole must be tackled. - You'll just look ridiculous. - Me? I'll make the rules of the game look ridiculous, the whole dishonest system. It scars people and warps them, and makes them sick! Aren't you sick, too? Why should I be an exception? And how could I make peace with a world that makes me sick? I'll leave you alone now, and I'll tell no one of your secret. - What secret? - Our secret. What's that supposed to mean? Tell them my secret. Tell them I'll destroy every one of them. You've just lost one of the ranks. I'd like to take his place. With your permission, of course. Well... anyone can join. Then you accept? It's a pleasure. Von Bohm. I need some champagne here. Champagne, please! Oh, this heat. Don't you find that hideous too, Mr. Weizmann? Demonstrations are legal under our constitution, Mrs. Schuckert. Hasn't that idiot given up yet? Are you deaf, Timmerding? Hi, Mr. Esslin. I'm having pork chops with Bohemian dumplings. A double schnapps and a beer, please. A provocation. Perhaps we could say he provoked us. Not if he remains outside. That's the thing about a provocation: You can't do anything about it. Assholes. You're all a bunch of assholes. What about public indecency? Only if he drops his pants. He doesn't even go to the whorehouse. Little hope there. I don't know what you're all so afraid of. Shut your mouth, Esslin. - Who's afraid here? - Perhaps you are. What should I be afraid of? I'm not in the land registry. What do you mean by that? Tell us what you mean by that! Nothing at all. Just that I know all the people in the land registry. There aren't very many. Come to my office on Monday. I'm taking disciplinary action against you. You're all assholes. If only he were a Communist. Then what? Then he could be arrested. Unfortunately, he's not a Communist in the least. Shall I tell you what you are? You're all little, rotten - I already told you. I'm sick and tired of you. Don't go to his office Monday. Come to mine. - Yours? - You need a new job. If you have a moment, we have to talk. Excuse me, please. Take her. Undress her. Throw her on the bed. Do whatever you want to her. She's a whore. The blood-red sun sinks in the sea Then my dreams did awaken Then you came along I was alone in a strange place The sun was scorching on my face Everywhere just pain and raw despair And you, yes, You Would you like to take a seat? One day the wind whispered to me And brought the clouds in from the sea And when the rain finally arrived It was just for me I would like - No, I have to - I want to buy your whore. Gladly. Here you are. Ren√©, a bottle of bubbly. Strip. Naked? That costs extra. Do you have any of that... slutty underwear? That costs extra too. Then put it on. Lie down on the bed. You really love me. We see the white ball lying 400 feet away. Rahn runs forward, while six Swedes form a barrier. Two Germans try to work their way through it. Here's the rocket from Rahn, and it's caught by Svensson. A clean over-the-head shot. But Svensson, who's always in the right spot, nabbed the shot perfectly with the tips of his fingers and made the save. So the Swedish goalie is out of danger, at least for now. Now they're throwing Juskowiak out! Juskowiak has been thrown out! Bohm has found peace. Yes, at least so it would seem. And he'll stay that way. Let's hope so. It would be in all our interest. Especially your husband's. Yes, especially my husband's. I hear Mr. von Bohm is working on the Lindenhof project again. Yes, that's what I hear, too. In a constructive manner this time? - I think so. - Let's hope so... so that everything can proceed along an orderly course. That it Will. Who can guarantee that? - Me. - You? You've impressed me. You're someone to take seriously. Now I belong to you... in a certain sense. Yes. In a certain sense, you belong to us now. I trust you. I trust you. We women have to stick together. We certainly do. On top of that, I'm happy your child now has a father. We can be proud of our social market economy that leaves the past behind and will bring us progress in the future. And for that reason I declare here today: Coming generations will see in this building what their fathers did for the future of their sons. I would now like to ask our honorable building commissioner, our beloved friend, Mr. von Bohm, to break the ground. FREEDOM FOR THE PEOPLES OF ASIA AND AFRICA Don't cry, Miss Hettich. I have to congratulate him! Are we going to talk philosophy again? Only if you give me a kiss first. First you have to buy me pink lemonade. First I have to buy you pink lemonade. She knows the rules of the game, doesn't she? Could I speak to you alone for a moment? - Excuse me. - Yes, dear. Are your problems with Mr. von Bohm completely resolved? Problems? We never really had problems. I thought there were a few disagreements. There always are between different parties. That's to be expected, isn't it, Mr. Weizmann? You're quite right. Hi, Marie. I still have a couple of small questions. Fine. Ask away. I hope you'll forgive my husband for wooing away your best employee. I'm grateful he's allowed to exchange ideas with me. That's something, at least. I still have a few things to take care of. Of course, Marie-Louise. I'll go now. But you'll be back at 3:00. Yes, punctual as ever. Oh, that's sweet. You're so sweet. A gift certificate. No one ever gave me a gift certificate before. Let alone for a whorehouse! What an ugly word. "Salon." A salon for the woman with the sweetest ass in all of NATO. How dare you, sir! I'm a married woman. Your husband is also named as trustee, my dear lady. "Mr. and Mrs. von Bohm hold the assets in trust until the 21st birthday of their joint daughter, Marie." You're so sweet! Little Marie should have it easier than her mother. You're such a sweet bastard. I'm a rather expensive mistress, aren't I? You could say that. And that's how it should be. Naked? Absolutely. But keep the veil on. That costs extra. So, Mr. von Bohm, is everything all right? Yes, everything's fine. Are you happy? Yes, Marie. I'm happy. THE END
