THE SINS OF MADAME BOVARY I had longed for a different life since I was a child. Marriage, that had been the receptacle of all my hopes and illusions, was disappointing me. My husband was totally absorbed by his profession, even though his ambitions didn't outstretch the region. - I'll be waiting for you next week. - Thank you, doctor. - Good morning. - Good morning, doctor. - So, you're hurt again? - I was playing, someone tripped me over and I fell on the ground. - Let me see. Come in, madam. I apologize. Whenever I hear that old man coughing, I'd like to puke. The house is always full of sick people, morning till evening. It's unbearable. Then you shouldn't have married a physician, Madame Bovary. Of course, I know. Especially a physician who won't get paid. Here no one has ever got rich. Those who are born poor end poor. I want to leave! He should understand! I won't spend my best years in this hole. Let's get back to your clothing. You said you can't afford a new dress, but I can't make anything out of these rags that you could wear at the Marquis Landervillette's ball. Just imagine the comments all other ladies would make behind your back. I just had an idea! Let's fix my wedding gown. I had forgotten. Come see. Watch the silk. It would be a crime not to use it. You should like it too. You're not going to tell me these are rags too? It is beautiful. And then it becomes you, with this black hair. Black and white has always been a distinguished combination. - And you, with your magic touch, will sew a wonderful gown. I'm getting downstairs to tell my husband, he was so worried about this matter. He knows this invitation made me so happy, it's been the first party for two years. I haven't danced since my wedding. Wait for me, I'll be back! Darling, can you come upstairs for a minute? There is a beautiful surprise for you. I can't now, Emma, I'm busy. Please, just for a moment. You will have to spare a little time for me, won't you? Please, come. As soon as I've finished here. This time you were lucky. A little lower and your eye would be gone. Goodbye, doctor. You didn't hurt me a wee. - Next time be more careful. - Thank you. Hopefully your husband won't get worked up, we're cutting your wedding gown! Men are strange sometimes. Well, if he can't afford to buy me a new gown, should I refuse the invitation? There aren't balls every day. You're magnificent! Your dressmaker is an artist! Where did she find such a beautiful dress? Some memory men have! It's my wedding gown, don't you like it? - Of course, haven't I just said it is beautiful? Very, very beautiful. Excuse me, my patients are waiting. Charles, why are you always in a hurry? You will certainly be the most gorgeous at the ball. Your husband is very kind, madam, and he loves you very much. But he loves his job more. Don't think I don't get it. But I am young, I have dreams, I have desires... You should have a child, madam, and you won't have to get bored anymore. - Tell my husband. He can't save time for this either. He never has time for me. When he comes to bed, he's so tired he falls asleep immediately. And who ever sees him by day? Good, you're here! The table is set. Thank you. I'm sorry, I'm late. Onion soup! You're a treasure of a girl. You always remember what I like. You're not eating? Is there something wrong? Is it about Anastasia? - What did she do this time? - You ask me? 'With a servant like that it is a shame. I can't stand vulgar people. And especially dirty. You're right, but she's not so bad for the rest. Dad would have sacked her since her first day. But the doctor is a philanthropist, isn't he? Let's drop. Little Josette... The one who had burned herself with the boiling water... She's recovering. She's a brave little child. The surveyor's wife, instead, will take a long time... She has a serious rash, a swollen belly... - Stop it! Is it possible that you offer me the stories of your patients every night? Couldn't you spare me? Just for once, can't we discuss something different, something nicer... I'm sorry... I assumed you were interested... Well, let's discuss the ball, then. Tell me, did the dressmaker finish your dress? Yes, she did. I'm fine. By the way, I cleaned your good shoes. Did you? The good shoes? The party will be very funny. Those shoes hurt me already when we got married, isn't it funny? You're going to wear the same gown I'm the same shoes. We will celebrate our new wedding, only this time we are in good company. Do you remember... I feel like I got a fever. I'm not going to miss one dance. Please don't rely on me, I'm hopeless, I would ruin your party. - This isn't true. - It is. - All right, then you're going to learn, I can teach you Follow the beat. One - two - three, One - two - three... Common doctor, you're already improving Come on, and don't hop, doctor, keep your feet on the ground or you'll look like a bear. I feel dizzy. This isn't for me. - I am too ridiculous when I dance. - Let's try together. One - two - three You see? You're doing good. Now try alone. One - two - three One - two - three I'm doing better. Just a moment. You go on playing- What are you doing? Why did you stop? Go on. I must learn. I don't want to make a poor showing tomorrow You already did. What's the matter with you? You can dance the waltz. Come on, I want to learn, even if we danced till morning. One - two - three... - I'm a little jealous, Gaston. - Of whom? - Your fiance the Duke of Artois? - No, I'm jealous of you, scoundrel. What is there in that provincial woman? She is a charming woman. You may know the Viscount Gaston, Madame... what was you name, excuse me? Madame Bovary. I don't know who you mean. I mean the Viscount Fresnaye. He's now dancing with the fiance of the Duke of Artois. He's the one who has engaged you for two dances. My previous escort, you mean. I didn't even get the name. - He's a very good dancer. - He's a very good Romeo. Did you notice how he looked at you? Be careful. This is a lucky night, dear doctor. What are you doing? Stay with me, dear friend, You bring me luck. This is my moment. Someone bring a chair! You're not leaving. You can't leave in the thick of it. Be seated. You don't have to do anything, just watch. You must stay by my side, dear doctor. I am playing against that gentleman, who is not the kind that leaves the field. So be prepared for along session. Well, if it's so important for you, and you're convinced that I bring you luck... Thank you. Thank you. May I have the honor, madam? I am besieging you, do you mind? I don't, but the other ladies will. And so will your husband. I've seen him at the gambling table, is he a fan? - I don't think so, but he doesn't fancy dance either. I beg your pardon. Please. You're beautiful. You're too beautiful. Someone's there. I am scared. - Too bad. - Let's go back inside. The ball will soon be over, I must see you again. - This isn't possible. - Everything is possible, where there's a will there's a way. And I'm willing. Madam, this is the last dance, may I have the pleasure? I am so sorry, milord, but I am too tired, I've been dancing all night. I apologize. - Viscount - Madam. - Be kind, pick it up for me - 'With the most pleasure. - Thank you. - Your wish is my command. - Did you notice too? - Who didn't, - but it's not our concern. - I am ready to agree with you to a return match, Monsieur Boudribourg. - Of course. - You don't know, darling, but our friend has lost a fortune with me tonight. - Luck is on your side, Duke, as regards both gambling and loving. Goodbye. - Thank you for the beautiful soiree. - Goodnight. Goodnight. - What have you been doing all night? - Don't ask... my legs are aching. - Then you have not gambled. Yes! All night long 'With my toes. Luckily enough, the Duke offered his guests the bedrooms in the palace. What a ghastly night. My feet are still burning. What about you? - Have you had a good time? - Of course! I've been courted a lot, which I didn't dislike. - All the better. I'm glad that at least one of us didn't get bored. Think that I've been sitting at the Duke's gambling table for five hours, and didn't understand a thing! - I couldn't keep my eyes open. - Then why didn't you leave? Because the Duke of Artois didn't let me. He said I was a sort of lucky mascot and he had some luck tonight. - 12,000 Francs. - Really? The Duke has won 12,000 Francs. I'm tired. So lucky. 12,000 Francs. The ball will soon be over, I must see you again. This isn't possible. Everything is possible, where there's a will there's a way. And I'm willing. So lucky. That Duke. Darling! You made me wait so long! I was afraid you wouldn't come at all. You're getting more and more imprudent. I had to wait that your fiance went to sleep. Don't be silly. That one has been sleeping already for some time, I sang him a lullaby. Come over. Do we have to be standing? Sit down by my side. - I am so sad. - Why, Madeleine? Everyone envies you. You're going to marry one of the wealthiest men in France. - But I want you, the best lover in France. Gaston, I love you. Kiss me. Honey, even when I'm the Duchess of Artois, only you can make me happy. You must never leave me, or I'll be the unhappiest woman in the world. But you won't leave me, will you? Still, today is a farewell, and for a long time. - No. - How can we meet? I'll be back in Paris, and you'll stay in your castle. Hundreds of miles will separate us, it may take months before we meet again. - Yes, but you are here now, close to me. My love! My respects to you, Madam. Get up! Are you acquainted with those gentlemen? I danced all night with one of them. 'With whom? The one who greeted you? - Didn't all of them greet? - That's possible, I was only watching the horses. I'll be back. Look what I've found. One of those gentlemen must have lost it. Nice, uh? But I can't use it, with the monogram. I'll keep the cigars, and throw this - No, wait. They might get broken, if you put them in your pocket. You're right. Let's go home. Home! Good girl. Dinner was good. I admit I may not always have been happy at my father's house, but don't you see this is hell? - Hell? Your Anastasia makes me live in the dirt, and the dinner? It is never ready in due time. There's one meter dust in the hallway. - Yes, yes. - She doesn't even know what clean means. Darling, Anastasia must go. If you find someone who cooks, does the washing, irons, feeds the horse, and does the shopping for a small salary... You are too easygoing. You look weak. Everyone takes advantage of you. Charles, nothing's gonna ever change here. If we stay here, our life will always be like this. We need to leave. I'm saying this for your sake. You are a good professional, a good doctor, you deserve to earn more. How are you paid, here? With vegetables, and chickens. You look pale. Are you feeling sick? I don't know. I suppose this cigar is too strong for me. Some fresh air will do me good. Why did you smoke it at all? Were you putting on airs? I just wanted to try it. I apologize! What kicks do you get from doing that? I was stifling. I was even more drawn now to the life, the world I had tasted with Viscount Fresnaye, compared to the awkwardness all around me. I longed to see the viscount again, and at the same time I fought against this longing, because of my condition as wife. I repeat: I must knock before coming in, I must always wear white gloves, and I must speak in the third person. - What are you saying? I haven't made myself clear. I must address you in the third person, and when I take orders I must bow. Good. I believe we'll understand each other. Good morning. I've had enough. These bandits! - And they call me colleague. - What happened? They made me do a poor showing. They treated me like a charlatan. - In front of my patient's family! - Why didn't you fight, if you were right? - Of course I was right, but there were three of them, and didn't let me speak. They believe if a doctor works in a small town, then he must be a failure or an idealist. Hopefully this brings some consequences, at least. - Which consequences? - That you begin to go to Paris. - Without money? - Even without money. We scraped the bottom of your dowry. If we sold the house, we could live in Paris for about two months. And then? - If we had settled in Paris, instead of this dirty hole, my dowry would still be there. Or you imagined you would become famous among these yokels? At the expense of your health, and my money. I'm not going to impose, you decide about our future. Only, hurry up! We won't even have this house in a little while. Emma! Come back, where are you going? Shortly before 3am, last night, I heard the doctor going out, and couldn't sleep anymore. I didn't want to sleep anyway, because I always have nightmares when there's a full moon. I will begin to believe in this story of the full moon in awhile. But it's true! Good morning. Make me a hot tea. - I am freezing. - Are you feeling unwell? - I am a little nervous. - Do you visit your patients at night now? - It wasn't a patient. - I was called for a duel. - What? As a doctor, of course. Who do you think I could fight? I wouldn't even know where to start. The same old story, a young woman. A duke and a young count, Gaston de la Fresnaye With a gun. I could do very little. I just filled out a certificate. 'EH3 I]]I'@ immediately. - I had danced with him at the ball. - Where are you going? Wait. There's a surprise for you. Another one? I was proposed a better practise, in Jonvilles. I agreed. Emma, aren't you happy? Yes, of course. The news of the viscount's death had annihilated me. My hopes died with him. My husband still didn't get it. With our new life in Jonvilles, I tried to devote myself entirely to him. After a year, we had a baby girl who brought along some quiet. - Not for me, thanks. - I'll have some. Cheers. You don't drink, don't smoke, don't have any vice. - I do, doctor. Fashion. Make beautiful women even more beautiful is my weak spot. You found a good customer in my wife. She gives me a lot of satisfaction. After our daughter's birth, she's grown even more beautiful to my eyes. But she works, she's busy with the house, with domestic administration. She unraveled qualities I'd never suspect. You are an enviable man, doctor, Madame Bovary is an exceptional woman. - You're right. - She even helped me appreciate my job. May I show you my painting collection? When there's money coming in, you can make investments. Come on, Lon will be happy to keep company to my wife. Don't you want to come with us, young man? Dr. Bovary - would like to show us his paintings. - Thank you, I'll join you - later if you don't mind. - He must recite a poem by Heine first. So it's a literary session. See you later then. - Come on over. - Dear friend, I'm waiting. - I'd rather have a drink first. - Why? Do you need more courage? Hopefully it is not a too frivolous poem. How could it be frivolous? Love poems always spring - from the heart. - Come on then, now I am really curious. Come on! What is it? I apologize, madam. I can't. Why you can't? If it's by Heine, it can't be bad. - It is not by Heine. I wrote it. Dearest friend, you forgot you were to join us. Weren't you supposed to? Doctor Bovary is waiting for you in his study. Go. Madam, before taking leave, I'd like to utter my sincerest thanks for your magnificent hospitality and your wonderful house. - It wouldn't be without your help. - You know howl admire you. You can count on me for anything. What's up? Don't you like that book? I can't focus. When I am with you, I can't read anymore, can't remember a sentence. Since I've known you I haven't lived on this earth, but high up in heaven. I am always afraid that this is a dream. I love you. - I apologize. - I am too old for you. I can wait for a hundred years. Time is frozen when you're in love. - A hundred years. - I can't wait so long. - Madam, please don't joke with my heart. I've decided I will leave for Verdillon. There's my uncle there, an influential lawyer, who will help me. I want to become a rich and important man, and then come back to you. I admit I will miss you. If you're doing all this for me, I am grateful. You're already leaving? Your visit was very short today. It's my fault. The child is growing, don't worry. I'm coming back with my husband next Sunday. Goodbye madam. I found new suitors in Jonvilles, but I wanted to be faithful to my husband. However, the feeling of dissatisfaction resurfaced again. I began to be indebted to afford luxuries and expenses, which my economic status wouldn't really allow for. A wonderful model from Paris, designed for a country outing. I have spent too much in dresses of late, and my debt to you isn't growing thinner, even if my payments are regular. You shouldn't worry about this. We found a solution in the end. You sign some IOU, and get what you want. All right, then I'll take this. These are the letters. Be careful, don't fall to somebody's charms. - I need this money. - Madam can count on me. I know the tricks now:. The credits Adolphe allowed me too often were now insufficient to soothe my longing. After the summer, the fall: the rains, the long melancholy expectations for something that would never come. Can we come in, doctor? Please, come in, Mr. Boulanger. I would have never imagined that a healthy man like you would need my cures. Why do you want to be bled? - I wouldn't advice this. - I can't sleep anymore, it's as if there were a thousand ants running under my skin, an unbearable itch along my back, there's too much blood, I needless. - Come on, you seem more scared than I. - Alcohol, please. Fetch that basin. Keep it below. Not below my face, below the patent's arm! I can't stand the sight of blood. - What's happening to her? - Yes, what kind of a nurse is she? - Weak nerves, she fainted. I'll be finished soon. How are you feeling? - Very bad. - Please, open the door. I must call my wife. Emma! Emma! Come over, please. - What happened? - Look, both fainted: my secretary and the nurse. - Isn't that bizarre? - That's because my secretary had too much blood, and she too little. I don't understand. I must have fainted. Come on, come take a breath of fresh air. Wait! This young man had better come with you, he'd use some fresh air too. - See, doctor? I told you I had too much blood. The itch is gone, and I'm feeling like new. Thanks so much. I feel so strong I would uproot a tree. - Very good. - Look what you did. A true bloodbath. You will have stained yourself too. - Too bad! Your nice jacket. - Never mind. - Are you a patient of my husband too? - No, I only have a second-hand knowledge of diseases. - The point is, you live a healthy life. Do you practise sport? I know there are many horses in your stables. Enough to make up a squadron. Are you a fan too? In my father's estate I used to ride every day, but there are no opportunities here. - There can be, if you want. A good ride would be good for you. You're both invited. Whenever you feel like. - Thank you. I accepted the invitation enthusiastically. That innocent diversion from daily life gave me back some joie de vivre. Unexpectedly. Please. That was some ride. Your husband would have lost some fat if he had come along. Did you notice he's left us alone for the third time? I did. Do you think he's testing us? Now you exaggerate. He's lazy, that's all. - Won't he be jealous? - There's no reason to be. The thought I could be interested in another man never crossed his mind. - But this must already have happened. - You should know me by now, and not insinuate things. - It's true. I didn't mean to be impolite. But your coldness is driving me crazy. You should have understood that I love you. Let's stop this. You're breaking our agreement again. - Do you remember your promise? - Fine, let's drop. Why are you laughing? What's so funny? No, Rodolphe, my life's funny! My morals. You are unhappy. I can feel it. We'd better be back. It's late. - There's going to be a storm. - It's beginning to rain. - The horses! - They're right there, let's go get them. - I am scared. - You need not to. There is an old cottage nearby, let's hide in there. Here we are! Wait here, I'll light up afire. Come over, you'll be warmer. Whom does this strange house belong to? To one of my farmers. Come on, sit down here, and take out your clothes. They're soaking, you'll get pneumonia! - That won't be necessary, my clothes will dry up like this. Fine. May I at least do that which makes more sense? I don't want to put myself in jeopardy. Come on, don't be so coy, get undressed. Or you'll have to be cured by your husband. It's still raining. It's wonderful. - Wonderful? What is? - That it's still raining. - Drink, it will warm you up. - No, thanks. My shirt is almost dry, and you are shivering. I'll be turned back, is that fine? Do you think I'll be more at ease? Meeting Rodolphe meant the most obvious thing: he said he loved me, and I gave in. That feeling was my last hope. Don't misunderstand me, madam, it's just an administrative formality. A formality whereby I must sign several IOUs. Let's be clear, the question is different. All right. The question is different. You owe me 7,000 Francs. - I don't have anymore. - Emma, you keep on misunderstanding. I don't need any money, and I am sure you'll pay me with the interests, but I need some guarantee. I don't want to embarrass you, keep your savings. Just sign the IOUs, I give you my word I won't put them into circulation. You know I couldn't. - 'With these I'm in your hands - You can do that, Emma. Madam, it's 2am, and the doctor is saddling his horse. All right. Emma! What happened? Where are you coming from? What a stupid question. I was longing for you sol came to visit. Don't you love me anymore? How can you say this? Don't you want me? Look. - Of course I look. - Don't you see I'm freezing? You've become imprudent of late. There will be rumors. Your husband will hear of something. I don't think any of this really matters. I'm not scared. Of course I'm scared, I'm terribly scared. 'Without you I couldn't live anymore. Sleep, honey. I've made my decision. Next week we'll leave together. I didn't care of anything and anyone anymore, nor did I feel any remorse. I felt happy, alive, important at last. The rest did not exist. Here they are, 700 Francs. I can pay for the rest next week. Believe me, we have so many credits. It's difficult to collect them. The same happens to me. You owe me more that 2,000 Fr. Excluding the IOUs I already granted you two delays. You should understand, Emma, I am not a banker. Then I must ask you to pay at least for the clothes I delivered yesterday. - I've just told you I can't right now. - Please don't become aggressive. You owe me, Not the other way round. - What am I supposed to do? - A handsome woman can always pay with a different currency. You are so smart as to understand what I mean. Should I get on my knees and kiss your feet? You shouldn't mine, but I yours. I had understood. But you are a smart man too, and you know that bills are not settled like this. Business is business. No one gives nothing for nothing, and this is true for love too. Emma, when will you show me gratitude for all the generosity I've always had for you? You won't have any worry anymore, and you will make me a happy man, - Enough! Don't become impertinent! I can buy from you, but I'm not on sale. - I don't understand you. You're made for love. Why not make love to me? What's the difference? Six of one lover and half a dozen of another. We already understand each other. And I would be satisfied for the time being. At last Adolphe had disclosed the ends of his generosity. To have me he had made up a stratagem and taken hold of me. I was not scared. Nor I would ever be, as long as Rodolphe existed for me. I don't think I can sleep tonight. Is my baggage really in Paris? You asked me for the third time. Let's sit out here. This is the city map and this is the hotel where we will meet. See? And this will be forever, won't it? I don't know how to express my gratitude, but are you sure that you want to go through with this? And won't get tired? Of me and my daughter? - I am sure. But it's not about me. You know my opinion. We should tell your husband. Listen to me. Why should we run like thieves? - Please, don't. It's true, I don't feel anything for him, but I don't have the courage to face him. All right. We won't tell him. - So... - No farewells. This is a goodbye. See you in Paris in two days. Place it on the table. I'll tell madam. I can't, miss. Mr. Boulanger insisted that I hand it out personally to Madame Bovary. - What's up? Mr. Boulanger sent you this strawberry basket, but this man refused to give it to me. - Thank your master. - Goodbye, madam. - Good morning, doctor. - Good morning. I love you. But I must leave you for this very reason. I don't want you to be unhappy. Emma, forgive me. One day you'll be grateful. I left alone. Please, don't look for me. Oh, my god! They look like painted! They're beautiful! - Mr. Boulanger sent them. - Mr. Boulanger is always so kind with my wife. By the way, where's milady? I heard her going upstairs, I'll call her. Madame! My god, what happened? Doctor, hurry up! Your wife! Hurry up, doctor, come over! What happened? Go downstairs and take the salts, hurry up. Emma! She has fainted. Maybe it was too hot. Emma... Waiter, fetch us some wine. Thank god, I can see you're much better. - How can you see it? - Well, you're reading fashion magazines again. You haven't for months. Tell me what you did. Did you obtain it? Apparently yes, the notary must still confirm, but the practise of my dead colleague should now be assigned to me. It will be more difficult to find an agreement with the house owner. - Is he haggling? - Yes, he's asking for too much. Don't give up. We sell the house in Jonvilles, and we'll borrow the rest. - There's no choice, if we really won't stay in Jonvilles. - You forget you wanted as well. Well, Jonvilles quite suited me. You know whom I met at the notary's? Lon! I told him you had came as well. He'll be here in a minute. He wanted to see you. I found him in good shape, you wouldn't recognize him. Apparently he's made a career. Did you tell him in which hotel we are? I did. He insisted that he sees you immediately. - Doctor. - Sit down. Madame. I'm glad to see you, after such a long time. - Please, sit down. What a nice surprise. My husband told me everything. Certainly not everything. But tell me about you. - What's up in Jonvilles? - Nothing new, Jonvilles is the past. While you talk, I'll pay a visit to the landlord. Lon will keep you company. You are as gorgeous as ever, Madame. Don't feel obliged to compliment me. Then I'll tell you that I admire you like I used to. I was right, Emma. Time has frozen for us. Yes, but not totally, we are a little older. Maybe, but not so old as to live of memories. I must see you again, Emma. I love you as I have always done. All these years haven't changed a thing. Tomorrow at 10 in front of the convent. - You will wait in vain. - I will wait nonetheless. You came in spite of everything. You make me so happy. If you are sincere, I must disenchant you, Lon. - I have been thinking a lot. - But you don't know what I was going to... - There's a letter for you. You will probably be moved, but don't misinterpret it. I'm not going to inspire any hopes in you, I only want to comfort you. - May I at least escort you to the hotel? - Thank you, but my carriage is waiting. - This is what I like in women: farsightedness. Come on - Let's go - Where to, milord? It doesn't matter. Anywhere, as long as you go. A complaisant hotel in Verdillon thus became our usual rendezvous. I found a convenient excuse for my husband, and told him I took piano lessons. I didn't mind pretending: after the setback with Rodolphe, I was attracted by Lon's devotion. What happened? What was the concierge telling you so secretively? - The mysterious gentleman of last Thursday asked about us again. - This doesn't make sense. The concierge only wants to pump money out of you. His requests are growing every week. - Maybe we should change hotel. - Where would you bring me? In a third-class inn? This is the only one possible. - We'd better not meet for a while. - You know I can't. - Why do you keep on saying this? - What if we were spied upon? Who would care? Only your husband. Or another lover. You might not be enough for me. You know how jealous I am. Why do you talk to me like this? Let me go! Do you always have to assault me? Are you interested in this only? What can I say. You've become strange for some time. You don't love me anymore. You speak of love? What do these afternoons have to do with love? - Emma, you know what you are to me, why make me suffer? It's as if you enjoyed it. I feel so insecure. By being close to you, all my complexes came back. I often feel like I'm a toy in your hands. - You've suffered too little. You're much too sure of yourself, my boy. You always put on macho airs, and I don't like it. You don't speak anymore? Just to get back at me. But your eyes betray you. They're begging for me. Come on, lay your pride aside. Here. On the other hand, you had the whip hand. I used to be hungry for love. Now I'm not. You only are pleased when you drive me crazy. It's exciting to be the strongest. When you really are in love, you're always scared you lose your loved one. Kiss me, you're now allowed. I've always dreamed of being loved. The way you do now. To be longed for is the most beautiful thing for a woman. Even when she's not in love. Why this hurry today? The coach is only leaving in two hours. - I'm troubled by the concierge's stupid chattering. I'd rather go now. All right. Then we can have a drink. That's fine. - Good evening, madam. - Good evening, sir. - How could you sign those IOUs? - I needed the money. - And how much do you owe him? - I told you, 20,000. 20,000 Francs? I will never be able to find this kind of money in few days. - I will return everything. I inherited a house in Dieppe, but I need time to sell it. Do you want me to speak to him? It wouldn't work. Your uncle, though. He always keeps hundreds of thousands of Francs in his safe, you told me, and you have got the keys. - What if your husband spoke to him? - My husband doesn't know anything. You only can help me. If I spent all this money, I did it for you in the end. - Fine. I'll come in Jonvilles as soon as I have the money. I'll find it, one way or the other. Don't worry. Ah... the bill please! This is so like him! He sends the bailiff at home, when I'm not there. How unfair! - When is he coming back? - Tomorrow morning he'll submit the IOUs again, that's what he said. And if you don't pay, then he'll proceed to judicial attachment. Lheureus is a crook. He gave the IOUs to a loan shark. These are some bills. Have them settled. Yes, madam. A moment! During the afternoon, go to the post office. If Mr. Lon Dubois arrives, give him this letter and wait for an answer. Yes, madam. Fetch these over there. Am I bothering? Your face tells yes. I wasn't expecting you so early, I thought you would come with the last ride. - I finished earlier. Emma, you look nervous, absent-minded. What is it? That's nothing, I'm very well. I always trusted you. Until today. Why, don't you trust me anymore? What happened in Verdillon? - I had a strange meet - 'With whom? - If I'm entitled to ask. - 'With Madame Volaire, your piano teacher. Tell me about it. What did you two say? Virtually nothing, because she doesn't know you. Are you sure it was Henriette Volaire? What does her first name have to do with anything? It has to do! You didn't speak with my teacher, there are two professors Volaire 'With whom did you speak? 'With your teacher Henriette Volaire, who told me she doesn't know you. Did you or didn't you tell me that you would take lessons from a Madame Volaire? - Calm down, that's what I told you. I said I would take lessons from Madame Henriette Volaire. Let's clear this up, I'll show you the receipts she gave me. I didn't know this side of yours. What do you think I would do in Verdillon every week? I've made a fool of myself as usual. Leave those stupid receipts alone! I only want to prove that you spoke with a different Volaire, not with my teacher, the adorable Henriette. I remember now! Maybe they are in my bag, or among my sheet music. I'm gonna fetch them. I don't care about the receipts. But she was so explicit... Are you sure you didn't misunderstand? What was she like, your Madame Volaire? Like all piano teachers... Now I seem to remember that her name wasn't Henriette. I'm quite sure of that. My patients are waiting for me. You'll find the receipts later, uh? It's 800 Francs. The maid went to cash in some credits, about 2,000. The rest will arrive tomorrow from Verdillon. Madam! I already told you you don't owe me anything more. - Your creditor is now Mr. Lumire - You gave him my IOUs! How could you? I trusted you! I was forced to, madam. The money I lent you were all my savings. I was willing to give them up - on the conditions you know. - Some conditions! I should have sold myself. It there ever was some sympathy for you on my part, you have destroyed it! Adolphe, please have those IOUs returned, and give me two days' time! You can't let our house go under the hammer, and my husband be sacked! Now you beg me! In all these years, you have never even given me a second look. All I had from you was derision and scorn. Nonetheless I've kept on hoping I would convince you that I loved you. - Do not use this word! Don't speak of love to me! You are not capable of that! - My situation proves it! - You made me what I am now! Well, supposing I agree, what happens? Tell me. In the first place, you give up all other affairs. I am no longer willing to pay for your other loves as I have done to date. That's it! I won't allow you to address me like this. I have spoken as a businessman with a woman who speaks my tongue. You know my terms. It's up to you to agree. I would never have imagined you were such a rascal. You are not a human being, you're a ferocious animal. You won't destroy my life, I won't let you! You won't wait outside all night for the last ride. - Of course I'll wait. - Come to my house, you can see it arrive from there. No, thanks, I'll wait until it gets dark and then I'll go home. - As you like. That's it. Put the child to bed, it's late. - She doesn't want to, you know how she screams if she doesn't feel like it. And let her scream, enough with this! I can't stand this strumming anymore. - No, no, I want to play! - Stop it, come on. You see, madam, what am I supposed to do, tell me. - Out! Put her to bed, before I get totally crazy! Come on, don't get angry! - Have you seen him? - No, madam, Mr. Lon didn't show, I waited until the last ride. I saw everyone getting off, but he didn't. - He didn't. - He might come tomorrow - I don't think so. And if he did, it would be too late. Talk to Mr. Boulanger! He can help you, and if you ask, he certainly will! No, Felicitas, I don't have the courage anymore. Please, try to calm the child down. I was on the verge of precipice. My despair came from the awareness I had ruined my family. I must try everything to save it from bankruptcy. I must try. I don't have any other choice. Go to hell! You're a miser. That's what you are. - A miser. - You're funny. Come on, get dressed. Dinner is served in half an hour. I will, but will you give me the check for the fur? - You need it now? - Do you want me to come naked to dinner? - Women are so exaggerate! - Where did you put your dress? - I threw it in the fireplace. It is in ashes now. That's why I need a fur now. Brigitte, listen to me. I never let impose on me. - Is that clear? - You're a miser. You'd rather let me freeze. I'm shivering. Show your mercy and don't let little Brigitte freeze. Sign the check, Rodolphe! But get dressed now. What is it? There's a lady who wants to speak to you. Tell her to come back tomorrow Who's she? - Madame Bovary. - Who? Madame Bovary. I let her in your office. Fine, tell her I'm coming. Madame Bovary? Let her come upstairs, please. Is she as beautiful as rumors have it? If she was your lover, I have the right to meet her. You don't have any rights. Wait for me here, and put something on. Yes, but what? - I apologize for my outfit, but... - I know, there's a visit for you. You look well, you haven't changed. - Thank you. - May I help you? This is why you're here, isn't it? I need 8,000 Francs. It's an old debt I have. It's a lot of money, but I'll help you, of course. - When do you need them? - Tomorrow at noon at the latest. That's impossible, Emma, I should go to Paris to a banker whom I trust, it would take a few days. Thank you anyway. Goodbye. Just a moment, let me think. For a thousand I could help you immediately, but for such a sum - I need more time. - Thank you, Rodolphe, it would be too late. Mr. Lheureus, Madame Bovary would like to talk to you. You don't seem surprised to see me after such a short time. It is always a nice surprise to receive you in my atelier. I'm not here to buy more dresses. I've only come to pay for my debts. Congratulations. How could you put all the money together? You don't understand, Adolphe. I am at your disposal now If you withdraw the IOUs and prevent the auction, - then I'll do what you want - Madame means... That I'll be your lover when you like it. Emma... I hope I can still call you like this. How long I've been looking forward to this. But I don't know what to do now. If you don't know, your proxy will. - I'll tell him exactly what to do. - I didn't mean this. Excuse me. Sir? - Jordan, go immediately at Mr. Lumire's and take Mme Bovary's IOUs. Tell him I'll pay for them later. Madame Bovary has given me the guarantee. I'm going now, sir. Goodnight. Let us begin our collaboration - so to speak, with a toast. Malvasia, an exquisite wine. To the woman I admire more than anyone in the world. I hope I won't disappoint you. I don't expect any gratitude, at least a partner in a better mood. - Then fill up my glass. Maybe I'll get in the right mood. I know what you think. That my way to woo a woman is not the most orthodox. - Maybe it is the only that a woman may agree to immediately. Without all the talk about love, - and broken hearts. - That's a possibility. Not exactly what I have in mind for the future of our relationship, but I've learnt to wait. May I do something else for you? Adolphe, I am woman, a woman who has learned at her own expense. How can I be sure that the IOUs will be returned? - That's right. Now I'll show you that I've always been loyal to you. Here you are. Take this check. You now have a double guarantee, if you don't trust my word. You make me feel ashamed. I'll keep my promise. But be a little more patient today. Please, fill up my glass again. Perhaps I should ask for your forgiveness. I put you in a state where you are compelled to get drunk. I don't want to get drunk, I'm only gathering up the strength. I have good reason to feel ashamed, the agreement we found is a real swindle. The price is too high for me. I am not worth 10 Francs. Please, calm down. You should not get drunk, I wouldn't like our relations to begin like this. I have always felt a sincere affection for you. I wouldn't abuse the word love, but... - No! Don't say that word! How many times they said it to me How many times they swore love. It's an empty word. I don't believe in it anymore. Love only lasts for a moment, and the rest little longer. Please, can you dim the lights? I'm saying this for your sake. Are you still so sure you long for me so much? You don't love me, I know, I feel it from every word you say. Nonetheless, I would be a fool if I didn't kiss you. You're mine, even if just for once. I must put an end to this situation. Only then will I find some peace within myself. Peace. I had reached the bottom. Now I felt the burden of my faults, derived by my silly ambitions of a little provincial. I wanted neither forgiveness nor sympathy. It was now too late to go back I only saw a disgusting life ahead of myself. I knew that if I continued to live, in order to save the innocent victims of my mistakes, that was the price for my redemption. I knew that my punishment was inside me, in my awareness and willingness to continue to live. The End
