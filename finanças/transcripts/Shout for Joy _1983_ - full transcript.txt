(soft electronic music) (exciting electronic music) - [Rick] Surfing, there's nothing like it in the whole world. To have this awesome wave hanging over your head like some giant monster while you're shooting down its side. To hear it roaring and crashing just a few feet behind you. And to hold your own against all that power, with just your speed, agility, and reflexes. Yeah, there's no experience like it in the world. And there's no place to experience it like Hawaii. Now don't get me wrong. Malibu, Huntington, Rincon, they're all good spots. In fact, we surfed there lots of times. But for me, and Joe, and Kimo, it was time to get down to some serious, heavy-duty surfing. And that meant only one thing: the north shore of Oahu. - You got bucks? - I got bucks. I can always sell my car. What about you? - Uh, I'm not sure. - Come on, man. - Well. - [Rick] Come on, Hawaii, man. - I can probably handle it. - All right. That's a great start, man, just thinking about it. (laughing) - It'll be like living in paradise. - Big waves every day, man. - Beautiful beaches. - Beautiful chicks. - Let's go for it, man! - [All] Yeah! (soft ukelele music) (relaxing electronic music) - [Rick] It didn't take too awfully long for us to figure out that the Hawaiian waves were just a little bit different than what we were used to. We must have been out there eight or 10 hours straight those first few days. And it was later that first week when we met Jerry. - You guys new around here? - Yeah, we kinda just arrived. - What do you think of our waves? - Pretty awesome, man. - My name's Jerry. - Jerry, how are you doing? This is Kimo, Joe, Rick. - [Blond Man] Come on, leave me alone. - [Truck] What do you mean leave you alone, what do you mean leave you alone? You took off on my wave on that last one. - [Blond Man] Take it easy. - Look what happened to my board when that wave dropped in on me, man. I feel like knocking your head in. - [Blond Man] Take it easy, man. - Take it easy! If you take off on my wave again, I'm gonna bust your face, you hear me? - Yeah, yeah, sure. - Look at this board. - That's Truck Simmons over there, isn't it? - That's Truck Simmons, all right. He's national champ. - Yeah, I know, that guy's everywhere, man. - He takes his surfing pretty seriously. - [Rick] No kidding. - So, you guys got a place yet? - Yeah, we got a place down at Rocky Point, right on the water, man. If I don't get a job soon, though, I'm gonna have to bail out. - [Jerry] Really? - Yeah. - Hey, listen. We need some help at the place where I work. We need another guy to help shave boards. You interested? - Are you kidding? - It's only three days a week, but the pay is pretty good. - Hey, man, that way I can surf the rest of the week. - We're located right in front of the pipeline. - All right, I'll find it. Sounds great. Hey, thanks a lot, Jerry. - Good, tomorrow, nine o'clock. - You got it, man. All right. - Later. Take care. - Whoo! (exciting electronic music) - [Rick] I was stoked, man. Things couldn't be better. A new place, a new job, plenty of time to surf. And I couldn't ask for a better guy to work with. Seemed like he was always helping out, you know? Like covering for me if I wasn't quite on time, that sort of thing. Sorry I'm late again. - That's all right, Rick, I don't mind doing your work. It's all right, you can start on the board up there. - Oh, wow. - Oh, not that one, it's wet! - I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. - It's all right. Don't worry about it. - There was something different about the guy, all right. After a week or so, I finally decided to find out what it was. You always pray before you eat? - Usually. - [Rick] There's something different about you, man. - Different? - Yeah, I don't know, you're just, you're different from the other guys around here, that's for sure. - Is that good or bad? - No, it's good, it's good. You know, it's just something I've noticed the last couple weeks, that's all. - Well, if there's something different about me, it's probably because of a very special person in my life. - What, your woman, huh? - No, she's real special, but not her. - What, you got a chick on the side, Jerry? - No. - What is it, you got some guy who's dealing some pretty good stuff, right? - Yeah, in a way. - Yeah, I knew it, man. That's why you're so mellow all the time. That's why you never get mad, right? - No, it's Jesus. - Jesus? You mean Sunday school Jesus? - He's changed my life. Jesus has got the power to transform lives. - Jerry, let me tell you something about Jesus. I mean, to me, the guy's just another guru, man. I got into that whole guru scene a couple years back. I mean, meditation everyday, the whole shot. Burned me out, man, led me nowhere. I mean, it's okay for you, man, but it might not last. For me now, all I really care about is surfing, dude. Just surfing, and I also care about my job, and I think I better get back and finish those boards. - Uh, Rick. Before you go, I wanna say just one thing. Jesus never claimed to be one of many equally good ways. He said he is the way. "I am the way and the truth and the light." And that separates him from all those other guys. See, those other guys, they were just men. If you were to go out there and dig up their graves, you'd find their bones. But Jesus resurrected himself as god and the son, and that separates from all those other guys for all time. (chuckles) - Yeah, well, maybe so, you know, but, it's something to think about. - Well, you think about it. - Yeah, I gotta get back. - You, a good credit risk? - Yeah, that's what he said. Because I got that job shaping boards. - All right. - This baby's only got 30,000 on it, man, not bad, huh? - Runs great. (car honking) - Hey, what's happening, man? Hey, you got my board. - Brand spanking new, just like you ordered it, dude. - Totally insane, I can't wait to try this out. - Check it out, Larry. Hey, you going to the party tonight? - For sure, man, I'll totally be there. - All right. - [Joe] Is he always like that? - Talk about a cosmic ranger, man, that guy is totally spaced. See you at 7:30, all right? (hooting and hollering) - I'm always the guy out buying the brews. - Hey, Jerry! - Oh, Rick. - Hey, what's going on? - How ya doing, I didn't see you guys there. - Just hanging out. - What's happening? - Hey, you really read that? - Yeah, it's a great book. You oughta check it out some time. You know, it's unreal how much god loves us. He really cares. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. I'm just gonna go get my wife, we're going to a bible study tonight. You guys want to go? - Uh, no, we're going to a party. Yeah, party time. - Okay, well, take care, see you around. - Hey, Jerry. Hey, praise the lord, man. (laughing) - Wait, I want to talk to him. Where is Rick, where is he? (laughing) (party chatter) (funky music) (party chatter) - Hi. - Hi. - I'm Rick. - My name's Alma. - What? - Alma. - Alma? - Uhhuh. - I've never met an Alma before. - Well, I've met lots of Ricks. - Really? Were they as cute as me? (laughs) Would you like to get together sometime? - Yeah. - Where can I get in touch with you? - Um, well, I can give you my phone number. - Great. - Do you have a piece of paper? - Oh, great. - Father, we just would like to pray for Rick tonight, lord, and ask the lord that you would by the power of your spirit, father, just convict him of his sin, and just show him there of his way, lord. And we pray that you would just draw him into your flock. - For such a skinny guy, man, I think you eat more than Pac-Man, Kimo. - Hey, what can I say, you know? - Hey, Rick! Hey, Ricky boy, guess what I just heard, man? - What, what, what, tell me, what? - All right, man. (cackling) They're praying, man, they're praying over at that bible study. - So they're praying at a bible study. - I know that, man, I know that, but they're praying for you, man. (laughing) They're praying for you. - You're putting me on. - No, man, I'm not, man. They say, lord, bring Rick back, bring him home, lord, bring him back, turn him off his evil ways, lord. Bring back that wandering boy, lord. - That does it, man. I'm going over there. Are you guys coming? - Hey, man, where you going? Hey, Rick, Rick. I mean, where are you guys going? It's a party, man. ♪ The joy of our salvation ♪ And I hope that ♪ Hi-ho, hi-ho, it's off to prayer we go ♪ Hi-ho, hi-ho, hi-ho, hi-ho ♪ Hi-Ho (guys laughing) - How'd you like that, not bad, huh? - Catchy tune. - Say, I got a question for you. I heard that you Christians don't believe in sex, is that true? (laughing) - I'll answer your question, but I'd like to tell you something first. Tonight, you know, you're proof that there's a god to us and that he answers prayer. We prayed for you earlier tonight, and here you are. Maybe not in the condition that we'd like to see you in, but at least you're here. - I guess so. - Rick, I might be able to shed some light on your question about sex. God was the one who created sex, so obviously he thinks it's a beautiful thing, right? If I was the one that made this watch, you would probably agree that I was the person who could best tell you how to operate it. Right? Well, god created our bodies, and they're a million times more complex than this watch. And he says that for sex to be at its best, it should be enjoyed within the framework of a marriage, where one person is totally committed to another person. - Oh, come on, you people can't be serious. (guys giggling) Let's get out of here. - I've had my fill of bible. - See you later. (guys laughing) All right, all right. Say, have you seen Jerry? - He's not here, he's probably down surfing. - [Rick] Of course, the next morning, I wasn't feeling all that proud about what had happened. It's not like I bought any of that religious stuff or anything, but I figured, you know, they probably meant well. And besides, I'd have to work with Jerry the rest of the day. I'd just as soon he wasn't too steamed. Hey, Jerry. - Hey, Rick. How you doing? - Oh, pretty good. Listen, man, I'm sorry about last night. I didn't mean to. - Last night, that's okay. I could tell you had a buzz on. It's all right. - You sure? - It's no big deal. Listen, how are you doing? Hey, you look like you got a hangover, you all right? - I'll work it off. (dialing phone) Yeah, hello, Alma? This is Rick. I met you the other night, remember? - Oh my gosh, it's him! - Alma, Alma? - Hello? Uh, yeah, uh, Rick. Uh, Rick, just trying to figure out who you were. Weren't you that cute little pudgy guy with the cute smile? - Uh, not exactly, I was the hunchback who rings bells for a living. (laughing) - I remember. - So, uh, would you like to get together soon? - I'll tell ya, I'm pretty busy right now. But I think we could arrange something. Aren't you a surfer? - Yeah, I love to surf, yeah. - [Alma] Mhm, well, could I watch sometime? - Sure, um, you just want to watch? - Well yeah, is that okay? - Sure. How about if I see you at 10:30, Saturday? (soft electronic music) (soft orchestral music) - It is so beautiful. - This is it, isn't it, man? This is totally it. I mean, all I really need are some tasty waves, some cool brews, and I'm fine. (soft orchestral music) We still kept hitting those waves, every morning, just like clockwork. At first we didn't pay much attention to this older dude who was starting to hang around the beach. - Hey, do you know who that is? - Un-huh. - I think that's Duke Kaikame. - Really? - Man, that guy's a legend. He used to beat everybody. Man, the stories they tell about him, awesome. - Why is he watching us? - Us, he's not watching me, man. That's for sure. - Excuse me. Aren't you Duke Kaikame? - You'll never be any good until you stop playing it safe. You gotta learn to go for broke, take risks. You wanna be good, I mean really good? - Yeah. - Like national champion? - Me? - Yeah, you. You want it bad enough, I mean bad enough so that it hurts inside? - I don't know, I guess so. - Yeah, well, when you decide, when you decide you want to work, then let me know, okay? - Hey, well wait a minute, wait a minute. I'm ready. I'm ready right now. - Right now you look terrible. You look like some kind of kook out there. Here's what we gotta do, come on. - Oh, man. I don't believe this. (exciting electronic music) (soft piano music) - Alma, you know, there's something really special about you. I really like you. - I really like you, too. - What are you doing the next 70 years? - Nothing special. - Will you marry me? - Rick. Yes, yes, yes, yes, I'll marry you! Yes. - I love you. - I love you, too. - The wedding was everything we could've hoped for. Outdoors, surrounded by a beautiful park. Just a few of our close friends and relatives. Well, maybe Alma put it best when she said, it was everything she'd ever dreamed it would be. - Duke. Hey, Duke, what's up? - What's up? You were supposed to be at the beach at six o'clock this morning. Now what's gotten into you? - I got married. - You what? - I got married. - Are you kidding me? - Hey, I got married, man. - A girl. A girl, that's all you need right now. It's ruined more good surfers. Six weeks away from the nationals, and right now you don't stand a chance. You could work like you've never worked before, and you still don't have a chance. - I could try. - Try, nothing. You should be so stoked on surfing that that's the only thing in your life. No wife, no friends, no nothing. Just surfing, don't you understand? - Just give me time to think it over. - Think about it, but decide right now. - Alma, I'll be back later. Of course, I was feeling pretty lousy about leaving Alma. But I knew Duke was right. To be ready in six weeks, I'd have to eat, drink, and sleep surfing. But no matter how hard I tried, my heart just wasn't in it. At least not that day. (soft music) - Large pizza with everything on it. - Alma. - Rick, please go away, I don't want to talk to you. - Alma, I need to talk to you, stay here for a minute, will you? Alma, I love you. - You don't love me. You care more about surfing than you do about me. I should have known it was gonna be like this. - Alma, that's not true. Look, I just want to try to be the best surfer around. Is there anything wrong with that? - I don't know. - I need you to be the best. I need your help. (exciting electronic music) Now we were a team, the three of us. And with Alma at my side, I knew that nothing could stand in my way. They were six of the toughest weeks of my life, but we both knew it was the only way I'd stand a chance. So we continued to work, and sweat, and cry. But this time, together. (dramatic electronic music) But there was another battle going on. One we weren't even aware of. Seems Jerry and Diane had taken it upon themselves to pray for us, praying we'd begin to understand what they'd been talking about. - And that you would bring them into fellowship with yourself. - I thought you said you could beat anybody. - And then there was Truck Simmons, the current champ. The guy wanted to keep his title so bad, he'd kill for it. And when he heard Duke was my trainer, well, the guy was out for blood. - Duke? Who is this guy? (phone rings) - Hello? Hi. Yeah, hold on. Honey, it's Jerry. - Jerry? Yeah, Jerry? Yeah, tomorrow's the big day. Hey, I really appreciate that. Yeah. All right, thanks. Yeah, take care, bye. Huh. You know, those Christians aren't so bad. At least Jerry and Diane, they seem to really care about people. I kinda like the way Jerry talks about Jesus, too. - [Rick Voiceover] Jerry and Jesus, seems like it'd been years since we had that first talk. But now, now everything had to be focused. My mind, my body, all those weeks of training. If everything went right, then I might stand a chance. With the tiniest slip-up, it would all be wasted. All those months of work and discipline. They'd all be for nothing. - Are you nervous about tomorrow? - I don't know, I need to be alone, you know? I can talk a walk or something, I'll catch you in a while. (soft orchestral music) (slow rock music) (exciting synth music) - [Bob] Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the world-famous north shore of Oahu. We're here today for the U.S. Surfing Championship. (suspenseful music) Joe, could you tell us a little about the north shore, particularly why they call it the Pipeline? - [Joe] Oh, sure, Bob. Basically what we have here are waves coming out of very deep water, with no continental shelf to slow them down. So you have all these tons of water exploding over a very shallow reef. This makes the waves so thick, so massive, that they throw out yards from the top, and create a huge tube, or if you will, pipe. - [Bob] That's hollow inside. - [Joe] Exactly, in fact, they say sometimes the tubes are so huge you can drive a Mack truck through them. - [Bob] Ha, really? - [Joe] And powerful, extremely powerful and treacherous. Imagine an eight, 10, 13-foot wave exploding, with all that energy, into what at times is only knee-deep water, with a razor-sharp coral for a bottom. Well, you can imagine the dangers. - [Bob] Lots of injuries? - [Joe] I'm afraid so. And sometimes, even death. - [Bob] All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're now in the final moments of the U.S. Open. Joe, can you tell us what the point spread looks like? - [Joe] I would say the point spread right now, Bob, looks like it's dead even between current U.S. champ, Truck Simmons, and the young upstart, Rick Irons. These next few moments are definitely going to determine who's going to win the U.S. Open. - [Bob] And on the outside, Truck's moving into position for a big one. Beautiful wave, look at that, it's got to be one of the largest waves of the contest. Beautiful positioning, he's dropping in going down the face. - [Joe] Look at this lip, Joe. - [Bob] Oh, it's gotta be Truck's final wave of the contest. Beautiful, look at him drop in. The lip's throwing out over him. Look at the shadow, the size of that lip, the thickness. - [Joe] Unbelievable. - [Bob] Incredible, he's so deep though, I don't know if he's going to be able to make it out of that, Bob. Look at that, he's buried so far back. - [Joe] Oh my gosh, Truck's wiped out! I can't believe it, Truck's wiped out. - [Bob] Ah, the disappointment. Truck Simmons, wiped out. A tough break for the champ. Such a perfect wave. - [Bob] On the outside, Joe, Rick Irons. This wave looks like it could be even bigger than Truck's. - [Joe] What phenomenal luck, look at the size of that wave. I can't believe it, a second wave shaped like that. Bob, that's incredible, just unbelievable. It's jacking up over the reef, terrific positioning for Rick. He's dropping in on the wave. Now he's doing his body turn. - [Bob] Phenomenal wave, Joe, just phenomenal. And look at his position. At looks to me like he's in nearly perfect position. - [Joe] The lip's being to curl up over him as he pulls into the tube. You're right, Bob, he's in much better position than Truck was in that last wave. It's throwing out over him, he's in the tube. Look at that. - [Bob] Unbelievable, look at the size of that lip. - [Joe] It's gotta be the biggest wave of the day. - [Bob] What a ride, just beautiful ride, beautiful. - [Joe] He's coming out onto the shoulder, the hiss is throwing out onto his back. - [Bob] I've never seen anything like it, Joe. - [Joe] It looks like he's got the contest sewn up. Ricky Irons. - [Bob] Look at the excitement, unbelievable. - [Joe] Look at that confidence, look at the exuberance. He knows he's won it, Ricky Irons, what an upset. - [Bob] Ladies and Gentlemen, new U.S. champ, Rick Irons. (triumphant music) - [Rick] Rick Irons, national champ. It was like my wildest dream come true. Suddenly I had more friends than I knew what to do with. Surf shops catered to me. Everyone wanted to be around me. But inside, there was still this, this dull ache. I mean, I had everything I ever wanted. Everything I'd ever dreamed of. But inside, I don't know, I was still empty. I may have been national champ on the outside, but inside I was a zero. And nothing seemed to help. Not the fame, not the popularity. Not even the dope I found myself getting more and more involved with. Alma was the first to notice. As the days turned to weeks, then to months, we found ourselves drifting further and further apart. It was as if nothing mattered anymore. Nothing had any meaning. - Rick? Rick, what's wrong? - I don't know. I really don't know. - You're not happy, are you? - No, I'm really bummed. There's got to be more to life than this. - You know, all you do is think about yourself. I'm not this, or I'm not that, I'm not happy. Why don't you think about somebody else for a change? - I think about you. - No, you don't. Our marriage has been going downhill for a long time, and you know it. (phone rings) If you really cared about me, you'd ask me how I felt about things once in a while. You don't care about me at all. All you do is sit around and get loaded all day. (phone rings) - Yeah? Yeah, Ernie, yeah, what's happening? Do I want to get high? Yeah. Is it the real thing? Yeah, let's go for it. Yeah, I'll be over in a minute, later. (intriguing music) (funky music) - Yeah. No, I have absolutely no idea. (Rick groaning) Um, look, I'll call you right back, okay? Bye. (giggling) Rick? (burps) Rick! (giggling) Rick, we need to have a talk. Rick, come here. Drink this. You need it more than I do. - Thank you. Oh, yeah. - Rick. It's over. - What do you mean, it's over? - Our relationship, it's over. I just can't live with you anymore. - What are you talking about? Is this some kind of a joke? - Look, I think it'll be a good idea if we separate for a while until we can decide on something more permanent. - Something more permanent? Alma, I love you. - You don't love me. Rick, you don't know what love is. You never talk to me. You don't share with me. You never come home to me. All you care about is surfing and your drugs. I don't feel like I'm married. I feel like I'm all alone. I can't take it anymore. I can't take this anymore. (pensive music) (softly crying) (acoustic guitar and wind instruments) - Rick. Hi, what's up? - Have you got some time? Can I talk to you? - Yeah, sure, come on in. Go ahead and have a seat. - Thanks. Hey hon, you guys want some coffee? - Yeah, bring us a couple cups. So, what's going on? - I'm on empty, man. I just don't understand what's happening. - Alma and I, all we do is fight. She's gonna split, I can't blame her. All I want to do is just sit around and get high and everything, man, I don't know what's happening. I've lost total control. - Well, what would you like to do? - You know, I notice that you, you and Diane, you guys got it pretty much together. And I think it has something to do with Jesus. And I was just wondering if you could tell me more, you know, about Jesus. - Well, sure. See, Jesus, throughout the bible, he gave us a blueprint for our lives. He gave us a way for us to live more meaningful lives, you know, with ourselves, with others, with our wives. But originally, god created us to be in fellowship with himself. Most of us have shined him on. We've wanted to do our own thing. We say, god, you go your way, and I'll go mine, right? - Yeah, I guess so. - But because he loves us so much, he sent Jesus, his son, to take the punishment for the things that we've done wrong. As a result of doing our own thing. Let me read to you here from the bible. From the gospel of John, chapter three, verse 16. "For god so loved the world that he gave his only "begotten son, that whoever believes in him "should not perish, but have eternal life." See, if we accept the forgiveness that god offers us, we can come into a right relationship with him. And then we can experience the joy and the purpose in life that he wants us to have. - That's what I need. Do you think we can talk to god right now? - Yeah, we can talk to him anytime. - Will he listen, though, Jerry? - Yeah, yeah, he's listening right now. - I've never done this before, can you help me out? - Sure, Rick. You know, you've been on our hearts for a long time. I'll pray, and then you just pray along with me, okay? Lord. - Lord. - Thank you for sending your son to die in my place on the cross. - Thank you for sending your son to die in my place on the cross. - To take the punishment for the things that I've done wrong. - To take the punishment for the things that I've done wrong. - I thank you that he's alive right now. - I thank you that you're alive right now. - And I ask you to come into my heart right now. - I ask you to come into my heart right now. - And take complete control of my life. - And take complete control of my life. - Thank you for coming in as you promised, lord. - Thank you for coming in as you promised, lord. - In Jesus' name we pray, amen. - In Jesus' name I pray, amen. (sighing) (laughing) Thanks a lot, Jerry. - Sure. - Oh, Rick. I'm so happy for you. (soft music) - [Jerry] Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. Old things have passed away. Behold, all things have become new. - Morning, babe. How about some breakfast in bed? - Are you all right? What has happened to you? - I've changed. - I noticed. - You know, you were right. I wasn't worth living with. I went over to Jerry's last night. - Yeah? - Well, we started talking, and you know, he told me that he's been praying for me for a long time. And, uh, well I just told him what's been wrong with us. - You did, did you. - Hey, not you, it's me. I've been the problem all along, Alma. But it's different now. I've changed. I mean, last night I prayed. And I became a Christian. And you know, god forgave me, I know he did. I feel clean, deep down inside. Will you forgive me, too? - Yeah. I'll forgive you, Rick. But, I don't know about us. - Can we thank god for the breakfast? - You cooked it for once. You thank him. - Uh, god, I just want to thank you for this food and for what's happening to me. And for my wife, I ask that you help her to understand. In your name, god, Jesus. Amen. Alma had every reason in the world to leave me. I knew that. It's just, I wanted so badly to show her that I changed. To prove to her that it was all real. But as much as I wanted to stick around and convince her, I knew she had to work this one out on her own. I knew it was best to give her some space and hope that somehow god would do the convincing. It was a long shot, but it was all I had. - Just keep praying for her, that's important. And show Jesus to her through the love and the time that you spend with her. Just show her that you care. And trust god. - It'll take a miracle, for sure. - Rick, a lot less of a miracle than it took for you. - Yeah. - Right? Okay. - Diane, I've decided to leave Rick. No. No, I've made up my mind. Um, listen. What are you up to right now? Do you think I could come over and talk to you? - [Rick] Later on, Joe and Kimo wanted to hit the waves. It was the first time I'd been out on a board in weeks. And believe me, man, it felt great. Like I was flying, like I could do no wrong. But always, always in the back of my mind, there was Alma. - I've done everything that, I thought was right to do, and none of it's working. We, uh, I don't know. I mean, just like Rick said, here we are in paradise. He's won the championship, we got married. We have a nice house. And I want to leave, I, I. Rick! Rick! Hi. Here. - Thanks. What's going on? - I just came from Diane's house. - Diane? - Mhm. - Jerry's Diane? - We had a real good talk, and. Well, you know what happened to you? - Yeah. - The same thing happened to me. - What? - I asked Jesus into my heart. - Yes! - Yes, yes, yes! Oh, honey! - Thank you! (laughing) - Rick and Alma's new life began with this joyful new beginning. And with this new beginning came new ways of living. I know and I can testify of Jesus' faithful work in their life, because I'm Rick Irons. And here on the north shore, Alma, and Shannon, and Ricky and I have experienced the faithfulness of Jesus Christ in our lives. And just as the characters of Diane and Jerry reached into our lives, we have been able to reach into other people's life with the message of the gospel of Jesus Christ. And there's been many people who have scoffed at us and there's been others who've said, there's no way it's gonna last. But the truth is that the bible tells me that he who has the son has the life. And he who does not have the son of god, has not the life. As you watch this film, you either know the son of god, or you don't know him. He loves you just like he loves me and my wife and my children, and he wants to come into your life. As Jerry told Rick in the movie, it's up to you, what do you want to do? Jesus was after me to come in, and to give me joy. I hope that you invite him to come in. That you might know the joy and peace of believing in the son of god. (peaceful music)
