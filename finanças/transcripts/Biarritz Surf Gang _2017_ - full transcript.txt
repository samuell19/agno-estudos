THE TRUE STORY OF THE GRANDE PLAGE GANG In the South-South-West of France lived a gang. A gang of pals, the best surfers in Europe. This story is the hidden face of French surfing. The story of Biarritz' Grande Plage gang. They were the group of surfers. There was no competition, they were the only group. In the 1980s, they were unbeatable, untouchable. French surfing reached its place thanks to this gang of lunatics! At the time, Biarritz was far less touristic. Because ETA blew up a few bombs every now and then. In the Mitterrand years, the fashion was to show off, money... We didn't give a shit about all of that. What we liked was to surf. But what we preferred was to fuck things up everywhere we went. My friends were... We knew we lived like no one else in France. La Grande Plage was 60 guys on the wall over there. We felt different, we over-exaggerated to provoke even more. Surfing was very punk here. And the boss was Sammy. We partied hard. It wasn't "no future", but "loads of futures". We had no taboos, we didn't care about the others. We did it all together. Good things, and some less good. We lived surf, drank surf, shat surf. That's all we thought about. And this is me. My nickname is le Nabo. We went very far together. Very far out. Some of us shone, and some never came back. KIKETTE 11 years old, 1978 Kikette appeared suddenly. He was 10, he'd stand further away by the wall. He watched us. We saw the kid was interested in surfing. He wanted to be there. Everyone liked him, he was a star. At the time, there were no little ones surfing. He was so hooked, he was really into the wall, in the atmosphere... He soon became the best competitor. It was almost an honour to let a La Grande guy nick your wave. The atmosphere at La Grande was really great at the time. At competitions, there was always this gang from La Grande Plage. We hadn't planned on doing competitions, but we realized we could make results and have fun. We had fun! When I started surfing, I didn't know competitions existed, nor French Championships. We were the pioneers of the new trend: long hair, wankers. We competed but before that, we were real wankers. It was easier to tell the guys, "Go get some ros√© wine" rather than go stretch on the beach. Those who stretched on the beach got kicked in the backside. We used to go to competitions... We would party! We got smashed. We'd do the contest and win. One of us always won. In competitions, others went to bed at 8 and we'd go at 3 AM. At 7 AM, we were in the water and won. The more wasted we were, the funnier it was. We won. Some guys were a bit gutted. A lot of the others weren't like us, they were serious and tried to win but couldn't. Or not often. Or never. Eric Graciet ! Eric Graciet: "Full throttle" We won all the titles, La Grande Plage was French Champion. Graciet, first leader Handsome and friendly surfers We enjoyed being the best. La Grande: French Champion The rest: jokers. Everyone has his wetsuit on, including the only lady of the team Cathy Monge. These moments are so intense. French surf champion You forget all the efforts to go past the waves. At the time, La Grande pulled surfing upwards. We'd revolutionized things by doing 360s all the time. During a competition, when we did 360s, they didn't know how to mark us. The judges didn't know about surfing. We wondered who judged us. There were generations of judges who'd never been on a board. Our surfing wasn't traditional. The judges were lost and that annoyed us. They knew nothing. How could they talk about surfing? Most of them had never stepped on a board. A federation wants champions, not nice guys. Unfortunately for them, La Grande Plage had the best. Sammy was the first to be French Champion in 1980. We thought, "Why not us?" We went to the French championship in Lacanau. We started to compete, it went well. I was qualified with Michel to go straight to finals. La Mouche and Eric had a second chance. We were sure all four La Grande guys would be in the final at Lacanau. There weren't enough waves. They stopped the competition. We went to see the organizers at the federation, and asked, "When will it be?" "Not right now." Due to a lack of waves today, the judges decided to postpone the competition to tomorrow 8 AM. No worries, we'll go home to Biarritz. Don't worry. We didn't like the vibe at Lacanau, so we went back to Biarritz. We partied at La Canasta, got smashed and went back in the morning, 200 km. We'd ran out of gas, so we went to a gas station at Lacanau. We just wanted gas. I don't know. The guy let his dog loose, it bit Michel. It bit my leg. Misunderstanding, a fight started. I got rid of the dog. The attendant punched me in the face. We get hit, we run off and get to the competition. They'd done the second chance the day before. To be sure there wouldn't be four of us in the finals. The final had started 10 minutes ago. We went in and had 10 minutes of series with Michel. I finished third. It was a huge scam. We were not happy about that. But they paid for it. Shit went down. We smashed everything. Chairs were thrown through windows. Someone came to warn us that the boss of a restaurant was looking for the Biarritz guys with a rifle. They had to get out of there because the guy was mad and could shoot them. I saw these guys who surfed really well. They'd come from Australia, California. We didn't like too many people in the water, and they stole our chicks. We hated the Australians who lived in Biarritz. Things often got heated. Sammy trained us and installed the rebel mentality. Sammy was the leader. At the time, he surfed the best. He could ride tubes. He'd been to Hawaii. He knew how it was done. The vibe. We were newbies. We hadn't travelled, we were young. In 1976, I went to Australia. I was on my own. In Burleigh, no one shared the waves. When he came back to France, and realized the Australians stole the French waves... He showed them what he was made of. SAMMY Australia, 1979 In Hawaii, you watch your step. You don't take all the waves. We were really tame here. The Australians walked all over us. They had surfed for longer than us. All we talked about were the travels, the trips, the waves, the boards. Mexico We had a 16 mm camera and since we went to all the spots, we filmed everything. Hawaii Reunion Morocco The party never ended even during competitions. I had a big mouth. They called me Nabominable. The federation started to have enough. They'll admit it, whether it's Nazerolla, La Mouche, or Sammy. They were difficult to deal with. After the European championship, we'd bought duty-free alcohol, and drank it in the bus. I was wasted and needed a piss. I aimed in a bottle but I was drunk so I didn't fill the bottle. It trickled down to the driver who started to shout. The president of the federation came to see me. I insulted him of course. Three months later, I received 5 years' exclusion from the French team. I saw Nabo piss on the judges' table. He pulled a few tricks. We were carefree, we didn't think of the future or careers. My pals were selected for the world championships in Australia. Everyone except me. I was so gutted. So, I dropped acid for a month and went on a trip. My own trip. We'll always remember the Australia trip because it was total mayhem. We partied hard and didn't surf much. It was a bit messy. Coming from the Basque country, partying is almost our job. There were so many contestants that we'd go to surf and... They said we'd live in a military camp. We didn't like that much. The International Federation president soon saw that the French team were loud mouths. They would not stay there, so they found a house. It was cold, it was in July. That's winter in Australia. The first night, they had a few drinks to warm up. We lit a fire with the cupboard from the dining room. It was still cold, so they started to burn all the furniture. First, the table, then the cupboards, everything. We burnt everything we could, even the fence. We burnt the entire fence. The owners complained to the federation who went before the international committee. We needed the surfers to behave, when we went abroad, the US, Australia or Europe, to take part in contests. It could not be a rat race. The sentence fell. Sammy was expelled from the French team. My thing was to surf stoned. I owed money to the Australians. The little money I had I spent on dope. Sammy didn't like that. I didn't want these guys to ruin 12 year old kids. At that time, Sammy and I didn't get along. We were the yin and the yang. Nabo is a nasty piece of work. The kid with a big mouth. It got rowdy at parties a few times. He called me a junkie. I answered, "Shut up, you alcoholic!" He punched me and the party ended in a fistfight. They got chicks by giving them powder. We banned those guys. Sammy really hated the Australians. One day, after surfing, at the traffic lights, the Australians pulled up. They arrived in a convertible, like a commando. We were not going to be pushed around. I saw a fight. I ran up to it and landed on Sammy holding an Australian by the neck. He told me, "Go on, whack him in the face!" I was like, fuck. I was just a kid. The juniors from Biarritz' rugby team saw this and they came to help. The junkies were there, they liked to fight. It was summer, there were loads of people around. It turned into battle royal on the walkway. I sent a few punches in the mess. A big bash-up. The blows came from all over. The cops arrived, the lifeguards, the riot squad. The Australians left unceremoniously in their cars like in the movies, slamming the doors! They broke our car and left. We didn't see them again. I looked for the Australians but I should never have found them. In the mid 1980s, the Arena Surf Masters came to France. It was packed. The first professional contest. La Grande Plage was packed. People everywhere. Suddenly, we ended up with all the surfing world at La Grande Plage. It changed everything in surfing. It was the beginning of surf business. It became fashionable with youngsters. It was smoothed by Quiksilver. Three time world surfing champion It started to be serious, it was much less fun. Everyone started to... Surfing took itself seriously. 200 companies, 700 employees. Aquitaine is an economic crossroads the most important in Europe for surfing services and industry. The main idea at the start was not just to develop surfing, but to be acknowledged by the Ministry so that surfers could live off surfing. We were too much of surfers to think of making money. We'd never imagined it would take that turn. From something despised by society calling you junkies and hippies, to something fashionable. All the stuck-up assholes are surfing. The Bourgeoisie surfed. Everyone surfs now. I didn't think it would become like this. People said, "Drugs are crap." There were no distinctions between drugs. When you tried weed, you automatically liked it. So you think, those guys are fooling me. They say it's crap, but I really like it. Something's wrong. So, I started to try out everything that came around. I was with Nabo who was rolling a joint. The president of the federation arrived. We weren't hiding. He said, "Can't you do anything better with your hands?" He said, "No, but I can skin up with one hand." He rolled it and lit it in front of him. They were responsible because through their attitude, they got rejected, let's not forget. It didn't just happen like that, we didn't say, "We don't want those guys from Biarritz." It was not an easy decision to take to reject them from the French team. They never came back afterwards. I slipped into the junky world. I went to all sorts of places. I had a double life: the junky side, the guys who did drugs, and my surfing friends. It was never enough for me. I always wanted more. That's it. I scored hash off the Australians for years. One day, they came back from Thailand with blow instead of hash. It was 99 % pure. And, I... I started to take some. I smoked a bong every morning before surfing. It was great! I could surf five hours without feeling tired. So, for two months, everything was hunky dory, I surfed well. And one morning, my pal who had the gear didn't get up. So I went to surf without smoking a bong. When I got out of the water, I started to shiver, I thought I'd caught a bug or something. I was tired, I was shaking and sweating. I wasn't well. I went home. I still didn't know. My pal was there, smoking. I told him I wasn't well and asked for a bong. I smoked my snowy bong and bam! I was cured. I felt fine. I wondered what had happened. There was another guy there who knew this better than we did. He said, "You're addicted, man.". His technique was superior to the others'. So, it made him a surfer who was radical. It changed the vision of surfing. He lived it to the max. He'd join the series that had started ten minutes ago, he rode 2 or 3 tubes and won the series. It drove a lot of people crazy. When he went off to the dark side, it really affected me. He was full of life, and when he left for those trips, it was awful because it was a one-way ticket. It really hurt me because we were at school together. We always surfed together. It was really sad. We saw him destroy himself. We'd seen other guys who died of overdoses. We lost some pals. Of course, we had parties, we tried lots of things out. It's easy to get hooked. I felt that that stuff hit you deeply. Michel was clear-sighted enough to leave. He felt it was taking a bad turn with heroin. We fitted in, in California. We bought a car, there were two of us. We rented a flat. Then, I got an offer for a job in Maui. The Hawaiian Islands. The 50th and perhaps the most exotic state in the US. Set apart from the kitsch of Honolulu, like the fifties, surfing, ukuleles, and swarms of tourists, Maui is the next island over. La Vie en Rose was a restaurant we opened in Paia, a tiny town on the north shore. We built everything ourselves. It was surfing headquarters. All the local surfers came. It was a great experience. Laird HAMILTON Inventor of tow-in surfing QUIKSILVER SURF TEAM CONTRACT I realized the enthusiasm for surfing was growing and how it could generate business. It comforted me in the idea of staying in the surfing milieu because I realized there would be results. I started a family. My life changed. I travelled, I worked as a consequence. I started to make surfboards. I organized everything around surfing. I can live off my passion. It's my whole life. When surf business came to the Basque country, I didn't think I'd get into it. I had the family business. For us, everything changed. Sammy went to Bali. Michel went to Hawaii. Eric worked for his sponsor. In 1992, Borotra was made Mayor of Biarritz. He decided to change everything at La Grande Plage. The work lasted two years. We focused on La Grande Plage, we replaced the car park with gardens. This project gave back to nature and pedestrians a space that had not been well landscaped. That broke the gang up and ended La Grande Plage's story. Only Kikette still competed and went on tour. I had my professional card. I went to England, Portugal, the Canary Islands. It was the peak of his career. He was a great contestant. He had style and was very talented. At a contest in the Canary Islands, I... I stayed there. I decided to stay there. I fell in love with a girl. We had two children. Everything was fine, I surfed perfect waves, I fished. Until the day, he tried heroin. Like a jerk, I got into heroin with my girlfriend's brother. We got into trouble, to get the dope. When you take that, you're full, you don't need anything. You don't need a great car, you don't need anyone to love. You can be by yourself and you're fine. It's a huge trap. That's when my life went upside down. When you're addicted, if you don't have money, you think of a way to get some. You come up with loads of schemes to get money from somewhere. I did some armed robberies. You'd sell your own mother to get a fix. In fact, if I had put all the energy that I put into finding cash for dope, if I'd used that otherwise... Because you use a lot of energy, in your mind, scheming to get cash... Some deals went well and others didn't. I saw some go very wrong. They shocked me. My problems caught up and I ended in jail. What really hurts is to see the sea through bars. I'm a surfer, not a trafficker. I've never killed anyone. I ended there by extreme necessity. What I was looking for was to find the pleasure and sensations of surfing. Find them outside. That's how I got into drugs. Each time I shot heroin, it seemed similar. It was close to the adrenaline rush in a tube. It filled my being in the same way. Michel found the adrenaline in Hawaii surfing bigger and bigger waves. Jaws is Hawaii's legendary wave, it's the biggest one. Laird Hamilton tears through water monsters, sea skyscrapers, waves measuring 10 to 15 meters high. I watched them do it. I found it amazing. That was above it all! We can do that with our sport? It's insane! So, we thought, "We need a jet ski." One day, we met Laird and we told him, "We're going to buy a jet ski with Vincent." "You Frenchies are getting a jet ski!" The problem was we went to Jaws and I'd never done any tow-in. He ate at my restaurant every day. But it was a different story in the water. We're no pals anymore. Laird wanted Michel to go through stages that he had been through. Like rowing to surf Waimea, and so on. That's what created a little conflict between them. Off we went with the wrong rope and boards. We weren't ready. Just making the board, I was sweating, thinking, "I'm building what's going to kill me." Off we went. Vincent driving, me on the board. I started to tow Michel in this inappropriate environment, I didn't know it, it was hostile to me. I took one wave. All good. Two waves, three waves. Wow! This is awesome! I took the three biggest waves of my life and didn't get my hair wet. It was truly exhilarating. Vincent was like, "Wow! Check out those waves!" I said, "Let's take a breather. You're driving, not surfing!" I was in position but didn't want to. But I went for it anyhow. I took the wave, it was rubbish, so I kicked out. And behind that was a monumental wave. Vincent came to pick me up. I thought if I tried to get on the jet ski, we'd all get caught: Vincent, the jet ski and I. Vincent drove past me, looked at me, expecting me to give him my hand or board. I said, "Move!" I paddled towards the wave. I duck dived right under the lip to manage to get through. It was the first time a guy had his head up at the top of such a big wave in the history of surfing. I caught my breath in the drop. That saved me. I wouldn't have survived in that monster. 1995 Michel Larronde takes the ride of the year Nobody saw that I'd managed to get out of it and nailed it. We saw Michel appear in the froth so I managed to go up to him. He got onto the sled and we left. Back on land, the atmosphere was icy. No one said a word. We spoke with Laird and the guys every day. No one said a thing. He wasn't wrong. We did the outside reefs the next winter. We didn't go to Jaws. We learned what tow-in surfing was. We experienced all its bad sides. One year later, one day there was a massive swell. Laird called us and said, "Guys, come up now." First helicopter-towed surfing Jaws, Hawaii While Michel lived the dream, Kikette and I were in a real nightmare. I took heroin because I loved the sensations, the freedom. But after a while, I was completely imprisoned. Imprisoned by dope. I couldn't surf anymore. I was sad. I didn't want to do anything. Not surf, not fuck, not eat. There was nothing I wanted to do. Life seemed dull. So, at that moment, I found a solution. I ran off to Morocco and that's how I managed to get out of it. I started to surf again. I got better there. I had to leave. I knew that if I did, the kids would go to their grandma's. So I went back to France. Every year, when I came back, I saw that and thought, "It's a good thing I left. That could have happened to me." One season, I learned that I had hepatitis C. I started the treatment in January. It takes 6 months. I lost my hair. I couldn't see for six months. I couldn't read. I had a job at Casa Pedro and didn't want to lose it. It was well paid. I decided to do the season. I took my hepatitis treatment, 200 milligrams of methadone. After a while, I couldn't get up. It was too difficult. So, I started to take coke. He relapsed. And he went far out. All summer, the guys on the harbour called me WMS, "Won't Make the Summer". I saw a psychiatrist, I took Subutex, substitute drugs, methadone first, really high doses. I didn't think I'd get out of it. Another tough investigation: the police are currently searching for traffickers who lost dozens of bags of cocaine that are beaching on the Aquitaine coasts. The first parcels were found in January near Spain. Since then, over 700 kg were found on French coasts but we don't know where the drugs are from. We were trying to get out of it. The coke came at the worst time. Loads and loads of people found some. You just had to look for it. Some people brought it to the police station. They didn't know what it was. Some used it to draw football pitch lines with it. Others must have torn their hair out. I'd found a fair amount. Some drug addicts in the Basque region got their supplies from the beaches and dealt a certain amount of cocaine. Biarritz before and after wasn't the same place. It changed entirely. I was like Tony Montana, I'd go to town with a bag and took spoonfuls of it. Party time! He went out in Biarritz, dressed like Clockwork Orange. He was high as a kite, he had a massive military knife. He put loads on the blade, in the clubs, everywhere. Biarritz was insane in those days. Occasional sellers gave up this timely, yet cumbersome, load half its usual price. Worse, this 80 % pure cocaine, degraded by the seawater, can also cause lasting psychological effects. I stuffed my face and became completely paranoid and crazy. With hindsight, it seems surreal. It was crazy. He'd given me 150 grams. I went to the toilet at my mother's house to score. I shot up. My ears buzzed, my heart was racing, I thought I was going to die. My mother banging on the door. I'd been in there for ages. I wouldn't open, I was paranoid, I could hear sirens as if the cops were there. It was total paranoia. After two hours, I came out. He'd got to an extreme state of madness. It was scary. I saw the state he was in: he'd got skinny. He was handsome before. And so... It was sad. I had around 130 or 135 grams left. I took the bag, went to the kitchen, opened the tap, and emptied it all out under the tap. I put it all down the toilet. Otherwise, I'd have ended down the toilet. That gear was so strong, so powerful, that if I'd shot it all, I'd have died. I spent three years partying, drinking, I almost died. I almost died loads of times of overdose, alcohol. I got to a point where I drank three liters of whiskey a day. At the end, when my mother was dying, I didn't want to live. I didn't want to live. The day my mother died, I wasn't able to say goodbye... So that was... That... That day, I decided to get my life together. To do that for her, for me first, but also for her. Either you live or you die. I decided to live. Luckily, I always had surfing. Surfing helped me get out of it. Even if I couldn't walk, I had my board. We surfed together. I came back from Hawaii and tried to give him the right vibe. Let's go surfing, give it all you've got. You're not tired, let's go. He got back in great shape. They did the world championships. When you're French champion, you're selected for the world contest in Panama. Go on, Kikette! Go on! Kikette was qualified. Sammy had won. There was Michel Larronde, Kikette and I. 3 from La Grande Plage. Kikette! Well done, Kikette! We'd qualified for Panama. Kikette had decided to meet us in Madrid. He was flying from Bordeaux. We got to Madrid, waited for Kikette. Here he came. I saw him at the end of the long corridor. I said, "There's Kikette." I asked, "Kikette, what have you done?" I don't know if it was the trip or the fact of going to the world series with the pals, but Kikette went to the contest completely wasted. I said, "No, Kikette, you can't do that here!" Fuck! We took the plane. He was in a critical state, he was wasted. He was plastered and carried on drinking in the plane. That didn't go down well with the hostesses. There was a western movie, he shot everyone, jumped around in the aisle. He was next to me, he was completely out of it. He smoked in the toilet. The hostess had told him not to. He said he'd smoke. She said, "No puedes! No puedes!" He'd sympathized because he's very endearing. What we didn't know was that he'd stuffed himself with hash olives. He'd swallowed them to have his stash when he got there. The next morning, Kikette had not come down yet. We said, "Don't screw up the contest tomorrow!" "Yeah, I'll be there." He got in the water, it was a disaster. He didn't catch a wave. He stopped there but he continued to lose it there. We struggled to get him to come home. It was complicated. Everyone was disappointed. I was gutted. Everyone had given him money to go there. We'd all helped him. And he screwed us over once again. I think that disturbed him a bit. Maybe that was one of the reasons why he realized he'd gone too far and was losing it. He came back to surfing. I made him a board that he loved. He had the willpower to go surfing before all else. Surfing is the driving force of our lives. Without it, we'd be six feet under by now. He'd quit alcohol when he got back from Panama. So I said, "Let's go to Morocco. At least, there, you won't be tempted. They only serve tea in bars and coca cola." It was all good. He was enjoying life again. He surfed, had fun. KIKETTE Morocco, 2013 NABO Morocco, 2013 After two months, he started to say he had sciatica, his leg hurt. But it wasn't a sciatica, it was his femoral artery that was blocked. My arteries were ruined by alcohol, tobacco. I've been messing around for a while. You reap what you sow. To avoid being amputated, I needed bypass surgery. The operation failed twice. Plus, I got a staphylococcus. Everything exploded. Lucky for me, I was in the ambulance. I almost died at the hospital but other times too. I overdosed before that. Heroin, alcohol... I've had three heart failures, in total. I see myself in all the little blond kids. I see myself at that age. I try to shock them with nasty stories, injection stories, with blood and toilet water. I shot up with guys who had AIDS. I knew it but I still did it. You're hooked by that stuff. Nothing else matters. I ruined myself. That shit ruined me. I hurt myself. It's not without consequences. You don't come out unscathed from 25 years of getting wasted. When I see great conditions and Michel is in the water, I'm gutted that I can't go. What a jerk I was to get wasted. I'm gutted. It's a great challenge to surf big waves at my age and enjoy them. I really enjoy being back in my country. There are tons of things to discover. We must say that surfing saved us from a lot of trouble. It could have ended badly. It's the most important thing in our lives. I surf every day, all winter. Winter, summer, spring. For me, it's like a drug. If I don't surf, I don't feel well physically. Mentally, I'm not well. It's another addiction. But this is a good one. My great pride today is to pass on what I live every day, this sport, to my children. We're experiencing great times together. It's fantastic, everything we've done. Today, if we did a tenth of that, we'd all be in prison. I regret many things but I wouldn't change anything in my life. Now we make the most of it. When I see them again, it's like yesterday. That's good friends. Ten years later, it's still the same. Life is beautiful. Of course it is. Make the most of life. I live for surfing. Surfing is within me. When you live with a passion, you're happier. To L√©onard Subtitles: Marion Cole Subtitling: TITRAFILM
