As far back as I recall, the best moments of my childhood were spent speeding over cold, white meadows, twisting my knees by sliding on ice, pretending I was Edgar Grospiron... When you ski, you have to know how to stop, OK? I would fall again and again and then again, absolutely frozen but always smiling. I'd stuff myself with bad spaghetti in mountain top bistros eat snow to make myself interesting, walk with 50-kilo shoes as if it was nothing... It was easy to put up with all this because there was something stronger, more beautiful. More important than anything, were the ski instructors. With them, life was paradise. You're missing an adult pass. - Pardon? You're missing an adult pass. I can't ski, I'm on anti-coagulants. - Sorry? I'm taking anti-coagulants for phlebitis! No need to shout. My grandmother did too but she was polite! 1,256 euros, madam. The photo of the kid didn't work, mad I wish she'd drop the "madam"! One thousand two hundred and...? - 1,256 young man. Jeez. - Get a move on! That guy'd better shut up or... Enough. OK. Give me that. - I'll take them. Hello, Miss! Adult pass, please. - 56 euros. I dream of you naked in the snow Adam, lose the phone! - Yeah, yeah. Did you bring your Ovomaltines? - Yes. Hurry, Mom. - Coming! Let me... - I'll come with you Céleste. I'm not leaving, I still love you. - I love you too. You haven't got your Ovomaltines. Sweetie? The air's pure in Saint-Malo, too. And you don't get robbed there. Hold me. Come here. Right... When does he arrive? - Tomorrow afternoon. Cool. - Damn! I forgot to get him a pass. - Will he be skiing too? Of course. He'll love it. - OK. Shouldn't we have tear gas, just in case? I'm joking, Wanda! Where's your instructor? - Over there. A woman. - Yep. Have a good day, Captain Hook. Hook had a problem with his hand, not his foot! Joke, Wanda. - I'd love to have Captain Hook's leg You look like your Mom. - How old are you, Céleste? 11. - No way, 11 already? She's a real champ. She's got her arr She'll be teaching you soon. But I didn't get my cabri. Never mind. Like wedelling? - Love it! You're gonna be queen of wedelling! - Great! Did you tie your laces? Hup! Aw come on, it feels good. I'll leave her with you, then. - Don't worry. I'm not. Seeing you, I feel like a fish in water. When I was a kid, I felt like a young goat in powdery s A young goat in powdery snow. - You know, gambolling... They're happy, they're... No? - Sure. Everyone ready to go? - Goodbye. Bunch of old ladies! No skating around! There, that's better. Great, Céleste. Smile, it's a great day! Good work. Well done, Céleste. Let yourself slide. Hi, it's your fave agent. Shooting confirmed. You're gonna nail it. Call me. Anne Elodie. Hello, Dr. Mey'neng, I... - I'm in Mauritius... Wanda Sorlin here, the legs model. Ah yes, the phlebitis. I'm calling because you told me it should improve around now... - But it hasn't? It's still swollen. - That's unfortunate. I feel like a pianist without hands. Or with a boxing glove. - It's no joke. After 3 months, it's there for good. Why wouldn't the clot go away after three months? You've had it for a while? - Over two months. I see. - So, not a good sign? No. - Sorry, is it a good sign? No, not a good sign! - I thought so. I have phlebitis, I'm not deaf. - Are you mocking me? I was trying a joke! Hello? Is that Boney M? - Yes. You want my death? I'll have it on my mind all day! You jerk! Also in the news, just as the climate summit is about to start. There can't be many just out of priso who go skiing with their prison visit It's cool, huh? What should he do? Aquabike? - Mom, your agent. Don't pick up, I'll call her tomorrow. If you take every jailbird you meet on holiday... Did you set yourself a limit? There was this homeless guy with his flea-bitten dog... Mom, your agent, Elodie! There are no vagrants in ski stations - Mom, your agent! Yes, there are. - No. I saw him! - Good for you. I'm not seeing things. - Mom, it's your ad! Switch channels, Céleste! Zap! Wanda? And I can't even ski. It's fishy. It's just phlebitis. Relax! You're a bit deformed, no big deal. It's perhaps no coincidence that it happened precisely to me! You're right, it may not be random. - See... Yes! It's because you're so attractive. You have to be special to attract phlebitis. Really? - You bet! Stop it! You're such a pain! Wait! - Did I hurt you? Sorry. Like this. Come here... wait... No, it's me this time... Sorry. - No problem. Now it's me... There! - No, it's stuck! You're beautiful, Wanda. This will pass. That's kind of you. Hello? - Hello, doctor. So sorry to disturb you again. I hoped that with the difference in time... There's no time difference here. - No? So what should I do, to have a chance of it going down? A lot of swimming. - Anything else? No big efforts. That's not likely, I'm not skiing. No strong emotions, either. It's calm here, a family holiday. And watch out for the post-thrombosis syndrome. The vein is totally destroyed. - It is? What is this post-thrombosis syndrome? The leg will collapse. - You never mentioned it, so I... And there's the syndrome of... - Of what? That's bad. - The what syndrome? And all of a sudden... - Hello? Hello? What do you want to do later? - Actress! Yes? Who's your favorite actress? Scarlett Johansson. She's great. - I like her too. She's strong. - Yeah. No, I mean... She's a gifted actress. - Yes. Do you speak English? You'll have to learn. You've got the basics! I know other stuff, but that's the easiest. I can say "skiing" in English: "skying". "Sky" is where clouds are. - Damn. Never mind. Go on, Thomas. Shit! - Up you get! Come on! - This is gonna kill me! Pull yourself together. I hate snowboarding. - Come on, Thomas! Strap it on again. - No way. Strap it on! - OK, let's do it. Follow me! Hello, doctor, it's Wanda again. Hello? Hello? Looking for a stable job Hello, Sami. How are you? Had a good trip? Not bad. I was afraid you'd change your mind. Right, shall we go? Need help with your bag? - No, I'm fine. This way. Well? Like it? - Uh huh. Wasn't I right? - Do you have a light? No, thanks, we're good. You know, Sami, here getting a light is for free. A light is never free. How's the family? - Fine! You'll meet them at last. I'm so glad. What about your daughter? Have you thought it over? Can we change the subject? It's really near here. Chambéry is... I don't want to talk about it. Wanda... if I'm bothering you, I can leave. No, Sami. Not at all. Come on. It's the start of a new life. You can eat whatever you like. Well, you can't... Except when you're skiing. Otherwise, it's... But don't you worry, I'm right here. How's that? PSG-Arsenal tonight. Fancy watching? - I don't like football. They're for skiing, not walking. Can we buy this one, Mom? - Sure. Wanda, he already has one! We're not buying it. We're not buying it Adam! - Mom said yes. They cost an arm and a leg. - Mom said yes. Thomas? Have you seen Céleste? - What about her? She's in love with her ski instructor. The skis Thierry chose for me are so technical. They go really fast on hard snow, so the turns are easier... Céleste, there's more to life than ski instructors. There, a nice cozy bed. You'll be able to come and go here. The kids are fine in the sitting room If you need anything, just shout. Sorry. - Be careful. No worries, my bad. What's that? A lamp stand. Thanks Sami. - We made 30 a day in the woodshop. It'll make a great bedside lamp. Again! - Mom! Enough is enough. - You give it to everyone. It's interesting. It's about... A climber who broke his leg and fell down a crevasse. Don't spoil it! - Tarzan in the snow without a liana. He didn't give up, he made it through alone. Thanks to the songs of Boney M. - Stuck in his mind. But instead of trying to climb his way out, he went right to the bottom. It's a great help to me right now, so I thought you... Thanks. - Let's leave Sami in peace. Sami, wouldn't you rather sleep on top? No, it'll be a nice change. Sami, I'm sorry. - No worries. There's no graffitti, no rats... Come on, let's go. Did your mom's jailbird arrive? Yeah, very shady. - LOL. Look, Mom, it's you! - Shut it, Céleste. Adam, enough! Let's change. Zap! Where's the remote? Céleste are you sitting on it? My cellmate loved this ad. - Really? He went crazy when he heard you were my visitor. Why? - He ate his wife's legs. He'd have had enough with mine, he wouldn't ask for more. I love skiing holidays! It's from Mom... To brighten the place up. Pretty little marmots. Thanks. - Good night. I miss you badly tonight. My parents asked where we want to get married. I told them St. Malo, opposite our pl Gotta go. James and Matthieu invited me to a friend's birthday. But you're there. - But you're there. Thierry wouldn't send you a text like - Obviously, I don't have a phone! Don't agents sleep? I'll call her tomorrow. Don't pick up. Who's replacing you? - I don't know. The most beautiful legs in Paris. Adam, get out of the way! What are you doing? Freezing my balls off in the snow. You? Adam, watch out! Thinking of you. Wish you were here. I'll never leave you. Can I have my glove back? I'm freezin - There. I love you. Surprise me. Adam! We're waiting for you! Adam, lose the mobile! About looking for a job, I checked on Internet. You have to do a skills assessment. Snowplough, a nice V shape. What are your strengths? How d'you mean? - For example, mine is my legs. I don't have any. - 'Course you do! Jeez! - You're doing really well! Well done, you've won a hat... Poor little whippersnappers. If they only knew what they'll get in 30 years! You forgot to turn... They'll all be traumatized. I'll never learn to ski. Of course you will. Not everything is fucked up from the start! Hello. Do you have kids in Thierry's group? - Yes, a girl. Everything going OK? - She seems happy. When I was her age I had great times with ski instructor It's great at the time, no barriers. You don't realize just how... But when you grow up you lose your illusions. Remove the red ski suit and there's no one there! Bruno, I still remember him when I was 15 in Courchevel... It's got nothing to do with sex. What isn't sexual? Her fantasies about Thierry. - No! Be clear! Did Thierry act improperly with your daughter? Why d'you say that? No one's a pedo... - You don't know that! I meant my joy during skiing lessons! The best moments of my life. Best moments of your life? - Yes! It's got nothing to do with pedo... Ah, yes! It's like swimming coaches, or English teachers. No way. Excuse me, but... - Such bad faith. You don't play tennis behind your coach. And English teachers don't slide. See you around, little lady. - I never liked skiing, so... I won't do it, but I'd gladly smash a few heads. You can't do that, Sami! That's what I said. I won't do it. - Wanda. What was all that? Nothing. But I think they got it, huh, Sami - Got what? How I f... - How you what? My problem. - What problem? Are you sick? I have a syndrome. What syndrome? Drop it. - Out with it! I have Ski Instructor Syndrome. Come on, Céleste. Last one down pays a round. Hi, Dad. Did you see my descent? Did you ski well? Was it fun? Don't move. It's such a pain, this thing. - Need a hand? You'll hurt yourself. Thanks. - A little kiss? See you tomorrow! - Yes! It's easy to do, I can... What about Thierry? Everyone loves him. Exactly. She's here to ski. He's always joking, telling her stories, he's got a great face, so that's fine. You must know about this. What? - It stays with you all your life. What? The Ski Instructor Syndrome. - We have a syndrome? A fibroma? - A vibro? You don't get it and it's not sexual. Calm down, guys. We take this seriously, madam. If there really is a syndrome, we'll find a solution. Put her with Sylvie. Kids don't get so attached to her. They like her, but... - Whereas adults... It's not traumatizing. - Someone must be available. There's Guy. - Where's Guy? No! No! Mom, why are you doing this? Life isn't always fries with ketchup, it's also brussels sprouts. I won't go with him, you don't decide for me. I won't change groups and if you keep Dad will leave you! Well, well, miss... Really! Is your Mom OK, Céleste? - No, she has phlebitis. But it's not sexual. So, not a woman, not an actor, not an athlete. Am I a fat Egyptian singer? - No. This game sucks. - No, it doesn't. My turn. Am I a nice guy? - No. Does your tattoo hurt, Sami? - Adam, your phone. Your turn, Céleste. Am I a character in a cartoon? - No, sweetie. My turn. I have a mustache. Sylvester the Cat? - Nah! Am I... idiotic, I mean really moronic. No, but someone with the same name as you really is. My turn. Am I a politician? - Yes! Think Maffia, bear killer, Depardieu. Homophobe. Putin? - Bravo! Inspired choice! To remember Tristan's parents await an answer. Our answer? What is this, Afghanistan? Stop. I won't give you permission to get married. Thomas, he's in love! - Stop saying yes all the time. Why do you always say no? They're only fifteen. - What bugs you? That at fifteen I know who I want to spend my life with? It's what I want, Dad! - That's enough. You're homophobic. - Homophobic? Yes! - That's ridiculous. They love each other. - They're only 15. Fifteen! - Why were you in prison, Sami? Leave Sami alone. We agreed not to talk about that. So, my turn... Am I fat? - Yes. François Hollande? - I've nothing to hide, Céleste. I killed a man, my dealer. What's a dealer? Someone who sells drugs to junkies. Stop it now, Wanda! Your post-it really suits you! - You too! Are you insane? You just said he had a drug problem. Not any more. He killed his dealer. Murder is worse than a little drug problem. Don't get all upset... - What's with the old lady? I don't know how I got lost, I know this resort well.. . He deserves a second chance. He's no serial killer, or jihadist. You don't have to inject, heroin can be sniffed or smoked. I don't recommend it. It fucked me up. And what's with your agent? Did you tell her what's wrong? Of course I told her. What's that jacket? Who are you? The jacket Gestapo? It's new! It's got integrated GPS. - But you don't ski! My lower vena cava is blocked by a clot up to the iliac vein! My future is clogged! You don't get me anymore. - No, I don't. Not for the past three months. Nor your so-called syndrome. - Ski Instructor Syndrome. The best memory of my life isn't when I took judo lessons. It's when you asked me to live with you. Have you seen her? A redhead... Your wife's just gone home! Thomas... This is for you. It's got integrated GPS. Did Mom visit you in your cell? We'd meet in the visitor's room. We would talk. Your mom has a nice smile. - Yes. Can I see your tattoos? - Sure. There's this. Here too. It must hurt. - No. How far have you got? I haven't started. It's when he gets right to the very bottom that he spots a sunbeam. I'm going out for a walk. You have reached Sarah's voicemail. Unless of course, I owe you money. Have a good day. Sarah, it's Dad. I... Got a light? - Sure. Thanks. Look, Sami... Oh, Sami... I'm not against you, and this isn't easy, it's for my children. I think of them and realize this situation is untenable. Could... No, he's not my type. He has fat thights. No, he doesn't! Look! Sure he does. - No! Wanda, look! I can do it! What? Do I look bad? - No, quite the opposite. Opposite of what? Look! What are they doing? What are they? Goats? Chamois? - Goats. They've left the baby! - Its leg is stuck. It's fallen into the crevasse. - Poor thing. I think so. - Like Mom. Are you OK? I'm not sure about this. Could we go tomorrow? If that's what you want. - OK, thanks. It's OK. No, it's not. We can't leave you like that. Oh dear. Not much we can do about that. You'll need tests. I'll give you something for now. - OK, fine. Have you got something mild, plant-based, for palpitations? Yes, what exactly is wrong? I have Ski Instructor Syndrome. But it's not sexual. There must be tons with it round here I have phlebitis. Be careful! That sign is the proof that... Sami! We're so sorry. We're a little on edge right now. Speak of the devil. I can't reach my doctor, he's in Mauritius. Is this Candid Camera? - No. Does what I say sound so weird? I don't want this time bomb to happen to my daughter. Well... - It's the midlife crisis! No way, I'm only 38. My wife's in the same state. That's enough, sir! Don't touch anything else. For the phlebitis, madam, you must swim. The pool is great. - We'll go tomorrow. Huh, Sami? It's not a good idea for him. Well, for others. Sorry, Sami. - No worries. For the Ski Instructor Syndrome, it usually goes away end of April. When the snow melts. - And the bimbos go home. Do you want this? You're not the ony person here! I can't do a whole length! You're right in the middle! Move over! - Shut up, I have phlebitis. Sorry. Hi, Mom! Mom? Can I give you a hug? - Sure! Got your Ovomaltines? - Three. Everything OK? Yeah. You want me to go? The flat's so small. Hi, Thierry. - Hi, how are you? Fine. You? - Yes. What did you do yesterday? I partied all week, last night I rested. Pity, we were at the Igloo! For real? - Yes. Sami? Sami? Sami! Thomas is right. You don't put a mad fox among the hens. You're not a mad fox! Besides, don't forget there's a ladder in the hen house. When you're on it, you make great encounters. Even though it's not easy for a fox to... I'll cluck to Thomas... I mean talk. Stay. You're not the problem. Why? I just want you to stay. - Sorry! Hi, Wanda! - Karine! How are you? - Great. I didn't know you skied here Coming or going? - Neither. This is Sami, a friend. - Hi. Karine, a modelling friend. - Chest model. I'm off, holiday's over. Three shoots in Paris. I have to go! See you soon, then. - Yes, bye! Bye, Sami. Nice to meet you. Shit, I'm freaking out. Bye! I'll be off too. - Wait, don't move. She can't see me limp. We have the same agent. We'll be crushed! She was flirting with you. - No. Yes, she was. She's pretty. - Not bad. She's not an eye model, but not bad. You didn't leave! Back to the whippernapper slope! - I'll take the next bus. You have to practise if you want to improve. Besides, I bought you a bonnet. Thanks. She didn't see, did she? You can't tell. - It does show a bit. Lou! Come closer behind me. Skis further apart. You're good. - I've been skiing 10 years! Quit showing off. - I just copy the instructors. Do you think I show off. - A bit. Take it easy, Lou. - Let's race. You pay a round if you're first back. - OK! Feeling good, you two? Chip 'n' Dale! Where's your new jacket? - I gave it to a homeless guy. Watch it, Wanda. You don't just abandon people. D'you think I enjoy being the jerk? You're walking a tightrope. - What rope? Is there even one? I have my limits. - So I see. Forget it. You don't have a syndrome. You've just lost it. I prefer that to being a coward. What's wrong? There, it's all right... Forget them. Why don't you answer? Is something wrong? You're scaring me. I'm leaving you, Adam. I've met someone. You + me, you weren't really into it. Or you'd've convinced your dad. Have more potatoes, you love them. Fancy some white wine? I don't drink. - I'll have one. Sorry. No problem. Sweetie, Thierry loves you. He told me so. Want me to talk to him? - No! Céleste! Thierry's a wimp, you know. You're so silly! Is it the wedding? You can put it off. That's not it! - Sami? Is there a translator here? I didn't do anything! - It's all your fault. Hi. - How are you? A génépi, please. Hi, Tinkerbell. You're trouble, you are. What? - Fucking up people's lives. What is it with everyone today? Leave me alone. Tinkerbell! Stop, Jean-Luc. He's one of my pupils. Sandy! - Come on. Does it still burn? - Yeah. Wanda, I'm leaving. No, Sami. He was aiming for me. He's clumsy. - I'm going to see my daughter. Don't worry, Céleste, I know a better way. Want to come with me? Of course. Is snowboarding making you aggressive - No. It's gonna get worse. - That's not good! What's it like, kissing an instructor - Relaxing. All good with you? - Yeah, fine. Go to bed, Thomas. You have school tomorrow. Another... Be good, Cyclope. Nutter. Sami's in our bed, he got hit by a red-hot pan. Adam's been dumped by Tristan. He promises marriage and... As for Sami, we'll work it out. Great. I hope that... What? - That she'll speak to me. What kept your spirits up when you were little? Ski instructors. - Really? I'm joking. - Idiot! Sami! What? But... there was a... Almond croissants. What? - That's what kept my spirits up. It will be fine. You didn't say you had grandkids. Are you on the run? Hello. - Is she your bitch? No, not at all. Actually... I visited Sami when he was in... When he wasn't well. A friend. Come in. Dylan, Mattéo, we leave in five minutes. You work from home? Here. Almond croissants, I suppose? Dylan, be careful. - Sorry, mister. No problem. Mom, can I take my football shoes this afternoon? D'you have football? - No. No, then. - Please. But... You have three. Did you get my letters? Since I got out, I feel... You feel what? Like I'm in a crevasse. - What? He means that he feels ill adapted, wounded. Like a baby goat that fell into a... What the fuck? - People change. Your father's different. It's time to make up. Make up? You've changed? You must be joking! You'll never change! I know that. You should too. You need money for drugs, right? I have no money. Ask your social assistant. Why would I help you? What have you ever done for me? Is he your dad, Mom? No. I don't think so. - Yes! It's clear that you love each other. That can't be broken. Like a promise. It can break. Except in Care Bear land. Goodbye. You OK? - Yes. The lame sheep return to the fold! Where is your prescription, Sami? - In your butt! He's not well. Can I have a word? We're the adults here, so let's try to talk normally. The kids are a mess. Adam got stuck with a narcissistic pervert, Céleste with a shitty instructor. Their holiday is ruined and probably their childhood, so their whole lives. What about me I only had female instr with mustaches and dicks! Stop it! It's not that easy. I've looked, and I've found a sickness. Marie Curie... OK, I've had it! "Syndrome", "disease", "Marie Curie", I don't want to hear them again. "Ski instructor" is barely better. "Ski" I can just bear. What're you doing? - Taking a bath. Now? - Don't I have the right to wash? You could wait til we leave. You've seen me naked before. And it shouldn't bother you. You wash with rapists, murderers. Who cares? Does it bother you? You love to trample people who are down, huh? Yes, Mother Theresa. And having a wash. Will you stop?! - No! Stop that! Goddammit! - Stop that thing! It's fucking hot! And you stop it! With your dumb diseases, your rich kid problems. You're busting my balls here. What fucking use are you? She makes your bed when you squat here, that's something Oh yeah? I'm not the only squatter. What? - You have lice. Say that again. You're full of lice. Shit! Céleste. Céleste, show me your hair. Shit, she's got nits. Dad, you have them too. - I'm itchy too. We all have lice. Wanda, we all have lice. Mom! We all have lice, Wanda. Thanks! Got any mayonnaise? You're sure about this? Yes, except in prison we mixed it with rust. Like in fish soup? - Exactly. But you have to use lots. I've lost the knack, but... I asked him to do it. - Are you crazy? Why did you do it? - 'Cos I love him. But son, you're not a tree trunk! She's insane! - Are you OK? What's with you? Are you crazy? - Enough, already. Wow, very skilful! Well done, Lou. International star! - Thanks. Your turn, Céleste. Get those turns right. Don't give up now. Céleste! - I'm scared. Weight forward, and slide over the hole. You'll be fine, I swear. Trust me. Get back up. Come on, sweetie. That's it, nice and slow. There you go! Great! You have the technique, but not the attitude. OK, kids, let's go. It has GPS. If you get lost in an avalanche, they find you right away. Classy! Yeah? Do you live here? I move around, season to season. You? I'm not sure... It's complicated. Want some? No. Sure? - No, thanks. Dammit! Shit, the dog! Stupid mutt! Heel, Cyclope. Dumb mutt's always doing this. Give it back. - He'd better not eat it all. Wait! Don't lick. Don't move. Wait for me. Jeez... - What? I just didn't realize... - Realize what? It's beautiful! Attention all! A child is lost. Why did you leave her alone? - She was right behind us! How can you lose a child? - We'll find her. What's she doing? - Wanda! Help is coming! You'll get hit by a skiier, Wanda. You can't see a thing. Stop this nonsense! Come back! No walking on the slopes, madam! What's she doing? Why did you call me Madam? Do I call you "Grampa"? - Grampa! When I was a kid, you paid attention. It was easy. It was great! Who picks us up when we fall? How do we know when to turn right or left? How do we cope when we can't cut it? When no one's around to tell us? It's not slippy anymore. What do we do with the cripples? Abandon them in crevasses? I just said that the slopes are for skiing. I can't ski! My husband's gonna leave me 'cos I have Captain Hook's leg. I wasted months going to Fleury-Merogis prison to visit a guy who cut the carotid of his dealer in a state of dementia! I may not be much use, but I'm still mother to my daughter! We're not your parents! Really! Everything OK? You? It's hard to grab the ring. What have you done with the ring? She's really going on foot? - No. The glaciers are melting. No one cares! Shit, yes! We won't save Céleste by standing around! What? Him too? I'm going too. - Stay here. Let me go, Dad. - Stay here! Wanda, stop right now! Wanda! Goddammit! I don't believe it. Céleste! Céleste! Why wouldn't he let me go? You'd never find her. You'd get lost too. The old shit makes my life miserable! Would you rather he forgot your name? A father who leaves you on the doorst when taking you to school? Who can't even cook pasta and who gives you dope when you turn 15? Who yells at you for no reason? Who lies naked, as if dead, on your rotten mattress? Would you rather have that? No. So cut him some slack. Is it really our fault your wife is.. - Yes, of course! Céleste! Nothing here. We need to hurry. In two hours it'll be -20°. Got it. We need to decide - L'Aguille Percée or Verdon? I dunno. I don't know! L'Aiguille Percée! My heart is heavy. You too? We need to calm down. Is this the bottom of the crevasse? Yeah, I think so. Which way is out? Are you OK, my sweet darling? I saw Scarlett Johansson. - Really? That's great! How are you? - OK. Are you cold? You're such a big girl, my love. Wait. Oh dear. We can't stay here. This may be more practical. - Yes. Shit, what's happening now? I have no idea. What the fuck? Can I get out? - Yeah, go ahead. Cut the engines! Something over there... What is that? Boney M. Stop, stop! Dad! - Thomas, we're over here. Everything OK? - Yes! Let's go down to the little pine tree - OK. Stay within 2 meters of me. - Yes! Dad! - Yes? I skied with Scarlett Johansson! You did? Fantastic! Everyone's totally nuts!
