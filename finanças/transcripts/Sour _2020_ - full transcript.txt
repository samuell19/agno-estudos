- Hey Deb. James, hi. Good news, I've got a listing for you. - Oh great, I've been looking all night. It's in your email. - Let's see. Now before you say anything, it is in the area that you want. It is at the price you can afford. It doesn't look like much, but it's really not that bad. - Geez, I don't know Deb. Well, look it over tell me what you think. Like I said, I know it doesn't look like much, but that's all you can afford, James. - This place doesn't look very safe. I don't know if I can let Kaylee live in a place, what neighborhood is this, I mean come on. It's in the vicinity. It's near where you would like it to be, there's just nowhere else that is going to go that low. My other suggestion is that you go smaller. Can't Kaylee stay with her boyfriend? - Elliot, no. I don't know about that kid. After everything that happened with her parents and missing a semester of school, I just don't think it's a good idea for her to be away from family right now. Well I'll tell you what, like I said, look it over, it's what you can afford, it's the space you need. The only other thing I can think of is that you can stay with Violet for longer and let me look around some more. - Yeah, Violet is no-go too. She's not gonna let me stay here another night. Well, that's what I have for you. Let me know what you think, give me a call. I've got to run right now. I'll talk to you later James. - Okay, talk to you later Deb. Bye. - Contact Marcus. Here we go. - This is Marcus. Wonderful, ah, no. No, I'm not busy. Yeah, I could meet you first thing in the morning. Yes, will you be by yourself? Perfect. I look forward to meeting you too Detective James I'm sorry. Yeah yeah, nope, I'll see you tomorrow. All right. Well - This looks like the place. - It's Nice - Well, it's what we can afford. Come on. Hi, you must be Marcus. - Yes I am. Gum? Oh, no thank you. - Nice to meet you detective. Good to meet you. - Let me show you around. Is this your niece? Yeah, this is Kaylee. - Well, aren't you stunning. - I have a boyfriend. - Cute. - Hey, can we move this along? - Of course, let's move it along. Like I told you on the phone, I grew up in this house. I moved out when I was 16 and then eventually came to own it when my parents suddenly passed. Kind of weird to live in it now though. Any who, you're going to love it! This is the kitchen, dining room, master bedroom is down the hall actually, follow me. So down that hallway is the master bedroom. It has its own bathroom as well. Hi how are you? - I'm good. - Yeah? - What's What's What's over here? - That's just another bedroom. Careful, it's dark, the electricity is out. lights don't work. Yeah, I've I've been meaning to get an electrician out here to take a look at that. This is pretty much it. - Where is that girl? Kaylee come on, there's more to see. - I'll I'll get an electrician out right away. I know it's dark in there. Yeah of course, yeah. - Any Any questions? - No, you don't know how hard it's been trying to find a rental with a monthly lease. Oh, I understand, I really do. You're welcome to stay as long as you want, or, you know, don't. So we have a patio door here. It opens out to the backyard, there's not much to see out there, but... - What What's sticking out of your sock? - Oh it's nothing, they're just glow sticks. - That's That's weird. - Well, it's not to me. It's really, it's nothing I mean, and we all have our own little secrets, right? Anyway, so the oven does this ticking noise, but I can show you how to fix it. - I know this move wasn't on your list of things to do. - We don't have to talk about this. I... I just know it's been hard for you. You know, I was kind of a rebel when I was your age. Uncle James I'm fine, see? Totally fine. - I can see you are. But I don't want you to sit around this house all day. I think you need to get a job. - Get a job, check. - And I hope you like mac and cheese. The cheap kind. - You mean like the kind from a box? Yeah, well, I'm not much of a cook. - I love it, it makes me feel 10 again. - And how does Elliot feel about the move? - Obviously, he wishes we were closer, but an hour drive isn't that bad. - I like him, I really do, he's a good kid, but I think it's a good idea that you guys won't be seeing each other as much. - I know how you feel about it, I know. - I mean it, I don't want to see him here every day. - Babe, what was that? - I think this house might be haunted. - No really, does your uncle know I'm here? - No he's asleep, trust me. I heard the same noise coming from this closet earlier. - What is it? - I don't know. Kaylee, I don't see anything. - Our landlord said there's some electrical problems in this room. - Maybe it was just an animal or something. - Maybe. Crap, that's my uncle! You have to go out the window. - What? I'm sorry! - What, are you serious? Yes, I can't get in trouble on my first day here. Kaylee? Could have sworn I heard something. What the hell? - Hey babe, yeah I was just about to go in. I can't believe my uncle is making me get a job. I know I need the money, everybody needs money but I just want to be lazy and spend all of my time with you. I know, okay well, I'm here so wish me luck. Okay, I love you, bye. - Where do you want me to put all of this stuff? - Just put it up there. - Everything is up there, that's not putting it away. - Sure it is. You've got a lot of boxes, just put it up there for now. I'll take care of it later. - Ooh, cassette tapes. - Those are classics right there. This is a classic, I love this one. - This seems like a pretty nice place though. - I don't know, I guess. I get a weird feeling about it. - What do you mean? - You're gonna think it's funny but, it kind of seems like things are moving on their own. - Oh, come on, it's probably just Kaylee. - No no, it's something different and that owner, I've got a weird feeling about him as well. - Marcus? - Yeah. Yeah? Oh! Hello friend, may I enter? - Sure. Come in. - Gum? - No, no thanks. - I was just coming by to drop off your extra key. Also to tell you I've got an electrician coming Wednesday for the dark room. - Yeah, you know what, about that. About what? That's as soon as I can get someone out here. - No no no no. I found a trail of nails on the ground it felt like they were leading me somewhere. - Yeah, that can sometimes happen. But why? Oh, I'm his ex girlfriend by the way, it's nice to meet you. - Likewise, Oh, gum? Oh, no thank you. - Oh, all right. Well, it's the house. You know, it's probably just the curse. Okay. - No I'm sorry, yeah someone was murdered here about 13 years ago. Don't you think you should have disclosed that to us, ahead of time? Oh, I'm sorry, I mean I didn't think it was that big of a deal. It was a young male when he was 20 years old or so. What happened? - Oh, Nobody is really sure. Some people think that it was a robbery gone wrong, others say that the family was falling apart and they killed him in his sleep. It was the first family that my parents ever rented to. They were only here for like, a year maybe? The police never solved the crime, so it was just one day the family was gone. You know, I kept their furniture though, which is kind of great. - Don't you think that's kind of disgusting? Oh. I... So, okay, well... So It's why you practically live here for free. Do you not want this key then? - He does, you don't have anywhere else to go and you're not living with me again. - I just, I don't know if I can feel safe here. - No, no. Detective James, no. just don't piss off the ghost. His name is Jeremy. If he leaves a trail of nails, just follow it. He just means he wants to tell you something. No? Wednesday, electrician. - What the hell? Knock, knock. - Hey. - Hey, I thought maybe you could use some help? Thirsty? - Yeah, thank you. So, what are your thoughts? - A little too sweet. - Not about the punch, the house. I know you've just been through so much lately. I wanted to make sure you were doing okay. - I'm still processing, it's a big move. I've been actually meaning to ask you a question. How come things didn't work out between you and James? - Oh, we can talk about that, I guess. You know, it just comes down to wanting different things. - But you get along so well still, I just... It doesn't makes sense to me. - Well don't get me wrong, we still care about each other, but why are you so curious anyways? Oh you know, with the move and everything I've just been thinking about Elliot and we've been together for so long I just don't see myself being with anybody else. Like, four years is a long time. It's not really that long. Where do you want these shirts? - Over there in that dresser, thank you. - The best advice I can give you is to just be honest and open with him about it. No matter what the problem is, you just need to talk to each other about it. - I figured you were gonna say something like that. And we both know I don't like to talk about my feelings. Yeah, and it doesn't get any easier either. Trust me. We'll figure it out, I guess, right? - Yeah, yeah. - Uncle James? Uncle James is that you? Uncle James, what are you doing? What is that noise? Hello? Hello? Ah. What is this sour taste? Ugh, that's so gross. What is that? Gross. Ew. - Sorry, sorry! Hi. - Doing a little shopping, huh? - Yeah, yeah. Will you stop looking at me like that? - Looking at you like what? - You know, like you want some. - I'm not that much older than you. - I don't know about that. - Seriously, I mean, think about it. Might be the opportunity you're missing out on. - You know I have a boyfriend who's a really, really nice guy? - I'm asking for one date. Dinner, a movie, some wine. Maybe we get a little drunk, maybe we get to know each other a little better. - Okay, let me just talk to Elliot first. - Ask Elliot. - We'll see. - So, you and Kaylee are pretty serious, huh? - Yes sir. - That's great, that's great. Hey, will you do me a favor? Do you mind taking that box out to the shed for me? I almost forgot about it. - Yeah, sure thing. Thanks. - Hey James, come look at this! - What is it? - You tell me, you're the detective. - You know what, it's probably nothing. Why don't you go inside and you can help me with the rest of the boxes. - What now? - I'm home! Ugh, My first day really sucked. I'm working with a bunch of bitches. Shit. There's that sour taste again. - Hey love, can I come in for a minute? - Um, okay, yeah. - So they're saying that these storms could get worse, and there's a leak in the attic that I patched. I just want get up there and make sure that my handiwork holds up. I don't want anything to get damaged. - Okay, sure. Yeah - Do you have any candles? Sometimes when it storms the power can go out. Where's James? - He ran to the store to grab a few things. - Like what? - Oh I don't know, cereal. - Cereal? - And toilet paper. - You're acting kinda funny. Did you? Did you tell Elliot about us? No not yet, I'm waiting for the right time. - I understand and I bought you something. Do you, Do you like it? Yeah, it's beautiful! - Yeah okay, try it on. Okay. - Okay Wait, where are you going? You can just change in here. - Right. - Right. - Wow. - Do you like it? - Yeah. - Um, hey, can I ask you something? - Anything. - Um, James found a box today. - A, a box? - Yeah, it contained a letter from a guy named Rob who lived here before us. Nope, no, I can assure you there's a, there's never been a Rob that lived here. - Maybe it's a fake name. - No, it isn't! Just, you know, just forget about it. - I, I don't know why you're getting upset. - Because I'm sick of being accused of things I have not done. Because I thought you understood me. - You're, you're making me really uncomfortable. - Am I? Okay well, just... You think I did it! - I don't know you that well. - You think I did it! - Let go. - I just, you and I could've been so amazing together. You and I... Could have been this beautiful woman on my arm to show off. - Ow, let go. - Let go of you? - God, God! Where? Where am I? What are you doing? - You You. made me do this, I didn't want to. What... - Shh - what are you doing? - Don't speak! Let me just Let me just look at you one last time. - What are you going to do? - Such a shame, you're so beautiful. - You know - Are you? - You know We all have our secrets right? - Are you going to... Are you going to kill me? Are you going to kill me? Are you, are you going to kill... - Shh, I told you not to speak. You know You know the ghost the ghost that lives here? You mean, you mean Jeremy? - Yes, Jeremy, yes, yes Jeremy. Remember one time you asked me when we first met, you asked me why I carry these in my boot? Yeah? - I carry them everywhere in my boot. It's because Jeremy is terrified of the light and he drowned in the bathroom right down the hall, in the tub. - Oh my god. - I told you not to speak! - So anyway, he was my brother, right. My brother and... - You're a monster! - Okay. Right. - I know, I know right? I know. - Please don't kill me. Please. No! Please. - No, no, no, no - Marcus, please. - What would make you think that I would kill you? - Please - No. - You know, Jeremy, he was my brother and he was sleeping with my girlfriend and thought I didn't know! Can you believe it? Maybe I was screwed up a little before that, but I hit him in the head with a hammer and then I nailed his hands to the old wooden cupboard our dad held in the shed. No. - I did! And I told him... Yeah, Yeah I know. - You're crazy! - Fuck! I told you not to speak! - God! You're not. Yeah! You're not a very good listener. I can't talk. - What was that? Shut the fuck up! What was that? I just heard something. Maybe it was, maybe it was your uncle. No, no, no, no! - I'll be back. No, no! No! Please! No! - Kaylee? Kaylee? Jesus! Hello. - Who the hell are you? Where's Kaylee? Oh. She's just down that way. She was just showing me some of her new lingerie. - What did you say? - Her new bra, you've got a dirty girl. - What the hell? Doesn't that car belong to Marcus? - I don't like the looks of this. Just wait in the car. - Like hell I will, I'm coming with you. - Just wait in the car! - Kaylee? Elliot. - You should have stayed out of my business! People have secrets for a reason. You murdered Elliot, you murdered your family! You don't think I'm gonna let you get away with this, do you? - You still don't get it. Secrets require lying and lying requires dedication! I have killed everyone who's ever lived here since I have. I'll let that sink in for a minute. - If you put one hand on Kaylee, I swear to God! Detective James. To be fair, I've put a lot more than one hand on her plenty of times. What, what? She was so scared she was practically throwing herself at me. I could've had her naked in a second. It's all so pathetic. - You son of a bitch. Oh, is that right! Do you taste that? Do you taste it? It's sour, that means he's coming. Jeremy? Oh my god, oh my god. We have to get you to a hospital! Oh my god, baby. - Kaylee, you have to get out of here. - No, I'm too scared. - Listen Kaylee, you have to go get that box. - I'm not leaving you, I'm not leaving you. - Listen, I'm too dizzy to go. Listen, you have to get that box or we have no proof of what he's done. - Where is he, where is he? I'm scared. - Just go get the box and get out of here! Go! - Maybe it's time we all move on. What? You can't be serious, after all of this? - I'm I'm tired, I'm so tired... I'm so tired of feeling guilty. Kaylee, I regret some of the decisions that I made in my life. I think Jeremy has stayed here because I stayed here. - Go. Go. I'm sorry Jeremy. - Where's James? - Get in the car, we have to get out of here! - Where is James? Where is he? What happened? Get us the hell out of here! Are you ever going to move out? - Eventually. But you know what, it's free here and it's not exactly free at the dorms, so. Why don't you say, Thanks Amanda, Thanks for letting me stay here while I figure out where I'm going to go. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, thank you. You know I appreciate it. Well, what about Violet? - Violet, living with her? No, I have her cell phone number so we keep in touch but that's as far as it's gonna go. Oh. I See. So Marcus, tell me all about him. Why do you always go for the crazy ones? - Good question. I have no idea, no idea. You had sex? - No, no. - Amanda, here's some mail for you. Thanks Mom. - Kaylee, I am so sorry about what happened. It must be really hard to keep moving. It's not the moving that's hard. - It's the reason for the move, huh? - First my mom, then a month ago my dad, and now my uncle is gone, it's just... - We're here if you need anything from us. - Thank you. Thanks.
