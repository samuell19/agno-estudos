I'm telling you! Oh god, Angie. You're too funny. What? Okay, that's what it looked like. Oh, I believe you. She just doesn't have the guts to say it out loud. - Hey! - What you mean - is Sam has tact. - Thank you. But I'm sorry, toupees are always a mistake. Hey, we spend all week being tactful. What's a little tactlessness between friends? Which is precisely why we need to make this happen more often. - Mmm-hmm. - I'm sick of a month going by - without seeing you two. - I always see you at work. - (Chuckling) - That doesn't count! I don't get a minute alone with you at work. We barely get a minute alone with her at all. I don't remember the last time we got to see you without Keith. You've been married, what, almost a year? At what point do you stop being inseparable? Seriously, Angie, I mean, it's getting to a point where I feel like I have to pry you two off each other. Oh, please, we're married, okay. We like to spend time together. Uh, don't take this the wrong way, but there was something that we wanted to talk to you about. Right, Janie? I still don't think this is that big a deal. I spend all my time with my family. Samantha: You have a kid, it's different. Would somebody just clue me in on what you... You two are talking about? It's just Keith. You're with him 24/7. Well, we're married and we work together. I mean, are you suggesting I quit my job? Or get a divorce? No. Look, we miss you, and that's it. And we know that Keith is amazing and you two are crazy in love. But... It would be nice if you weren't constantly canceling on us - to spend time with him. - He's a romantic, okay? He likes to surprise me. If I have plans with you and he surprises me with a couples' massage, what am I supposed to do? Does it have to be every weekend, though? The second you met him, it was like, he completely absorbed you. He told you he loved you after the first three dates. I... And you didn't even think it was weird! And the presents and the weekend getaways! There's something wrong with that? No, no. Look, we're just getting a little off track. No, you know what? It doesn't matter if he waited a year to tell me loved me. You never liked Keith. - That's not true. - Mmm. I just think you two are moving so fast. Would you two stop? This is the first time in a month that I've gotten to go out and talk to grown-ups. If I don't get at least one conversation this week that doesn't revolve around allergen-free school lunches, and a cartoon about a talking panda, I'm gonna lose it! (Giggling) I will. You're right. I shouldn't have said anything. No... No, I... I should be making more of an effort. See? Was that so hard? - Yeah, it was a little hard. - Janie: Just come here! - (Laughing) - Just come here! (Laughing) - Can we just go back... - No, not the toupee! - Yes! Yes! - No! ♪ (Sports game playing on TV) Mmm! Babe? It's back on. (Sighing) They just threw the most incredible pass. Sadly the guy just... Oh... - (Whimpering) - Hey. Come here. I really thought this was it. Yeah. It's only been a couple months. It's gonna happen. Yeah, but when? You know... Found the guy, found the house... The baby is supposed to be next. I just... I've been waiting to have a family my whole life. You have a family. We could have a baby this year and next year, or never, you got me. I am your family now, no matter what. Yeah, it's just, I was so sure. I've been feeling off all week. Ah, you're putting too much pressure on yourself. If you're stressed and exhausted, it's not gonna happen. Yeah, I know. Maybe you should take some time off work? I know you've been prepping for this fundraiser, but maybe after that you drop down to part time. - I can't do that. - Of course you can. Cherise is a mother, she'll understand. Honestly, I think if I don't have work to distract me, I'd probably drive myself crazy. Well, how about I make you a cup of tea? - With lemon? - (Laughing) Whatever you want. What did I do to deserve you? I was just wondering the same thing. (Laughing) You've gotta be patient, babe. It's gonna happen. Mm-hm. I know. Now that's my girl. ♪ (Phone ringing) I bought make-up coffee. You didn't have to do that, we weren't actually fighting. It's your marriage. I never meant to overstep. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Is that hazelnut? I thought it was the most apologetic flavour. (Smacking lips) I think it's working! - (Giggling) - Good! Because if I had to sit through this meeting thinking you were mad at me... I was never mad at you, Oaky? I just don't want you to think that I got married and I don't need you in my life anymore, 'cause that's definitely not true. - Good. - Besides, I'm pretty sure this meeting is going to be bad enough as it is. - Is that right? - Oh yeah. The lady leading it has no idea what she's doing. (Laughing) Um... I also, uh, I took a pregnancy test a few days ago. My period's been late and I really thought... But I was wrong. Oh, ang. I'm so sorry. Hey, at least I still have caffeine to console me. Well, you never know. I had a friend that tested negative and took another test three days later, and it was positive. - Really? - Yeah. Something about the chemicals needing time to build up. So you never know, it might be worth trying again. Yeah. Thanks. No problem. There you are. First time leading a meeting. You ready? I think so. Don't be nervous, you're gonna be great. (Chuckling) You got this. - (Blowing kisses) - (Samantha squealing) So those are the broad strokes. If my projections are correct, then this event will mean that we will reach our fundraising foal for the year - two months early. - (Samantha cheering) (Applauding) That was great! Good job! - Well done! - Thanks. You're a natural public speaker. My first meeting, I barely got eight words out between "um's." I practiced with Keith. Oh, he's a great one for that. Very confident public speaker. Do you need anything else from me? I was going to call a few of the donors. Um, actually, I'd like to have a quick chat. - Do you have some time? - Oh, uh, sure. Is everything okay? Sorry, I didn't mean to worry you. I just wanted to have this conversation - without anyone around. - Uh, what conversation? I want to make sure that I'm not putting too much on you. No! No, you're not, I'm excited for this project. You don't need to be a super woman. I promise you, your career will be here for you even if it isn't your number one priority right now. Where is this coming from? Sorry, I thought you knew. Keith came to talk to me this morning. Uh... no. What? He said that you were worried that the stress of work was interfering with your fertility. - He said that to you? - And honestly, I'm a mom. You know what they say. You don't lay on your deathbed and think, "I should have spent more time at work." If being a mom is important to you and this job is getting in the way... I completely understand. I really appreciate that, and I might take you up on that offer once I do have kids, but until then, I'm doing fine. I mean, I love my work, and I’m excited for this project. I'm so sorry if Keith gave you the wrong impression. All right, then. Let me know if you change your mind. - Thanks. - And Angela? I really hope this happens for you. I think you're gonna be a great mom. Thanks. Okay. ♪ - Keith. - Hey, sweetheart. Hey. I'm sorry I missed your presentation. - I heard it was fantastic. - Uh, can we talk? Uh, is something wrong? What happened? - Are you serious? - Am I...? What's wrong? What happened? - Cherise talked to me. - What'd she say? Is she going to let you cut back on hours? She said you went and talked to her about me. Right. About you slowing down at work. Like we were talking about yesterday. I said I didn't want to do that! Oh, I didn't tell her you were definitely doing it, I was... I was just feeling her out, seeing if that might be an option. This is my career! If I need a break, then I need to be the one to have that conversation with her. I've been with the company longer. I thought she might react better if she heard it from me. Cherise is never going to take me seriously if you're fighting my battles for me. I didn't want you to be too intimidated to speak to her. -(Cell phone ringing) - I'm your husband, it's my job to protect you, you can't expect me to stand by! Okay, yes, I can. You're being extremely condescending right now. - Condescending? How am I... - You know what? I... I can't even talk about this. I'm gonna get back to work. Angie, are you... Hey, um, when I need you to protect me, I'll let you know. (Scoffing) Okay. Wow. (Sighing) Listen, about earlier. - It's fine. - No. It's not fine. I was just trying to take care of you, and I'm sorry that you feel like what I did was disrespectful. I did not mean to be condescending. Well, thank you for saying that. Growing up, my dad was, like, Superman. I mean, anything my mom and I wanted, he was right there, didn't have to ask. That's why he bought us the house. That's his way of showing love, and I always swore that when I had a family of my own. I was going to be that guy for my wife. - I mean, my mom... - I am not your mom. Okay, listen. I know... I know this is coming from a good place. But... I'm happy with us just being normal people, okay? You don't have to be a superhero for me, babe. Yeah, maybe it's just old fashioned. I know that you are a smart, capable, strong woman, and I'm sorry that I made you feel like you weren't. I have to learn how to balance work and a home life. And I just think I should start figuring out how to do that now. Yeah, I can understand that. Okay, how about a compromise. When we're at work, I promise not to overstep. When we're at home... (Laughing) Let me treat you like the queen that you are. Huh? I think I can handle that. All right. (Sports game playing on TV) Yes! Yes! Babe? Mmm. Oh, baby? Angie? - Angie? - Okay. Keith: On your way back, can you grab me a beer? (Cheering) (Screaming) Yeah! It finally happened! (Screaming) (Laughing excitedly) Oh! Whoa! We're gonna have a baby! Oh, I told you! I told you! I told you! I told you! I told you it was going to happen. - Oh... - (Laughing) I want to wait. I want to tell everyone together. - Okay. - Okay? Of course. Of course, baby. (Laughing happily) She's gonna cancel again. - I don't think so. - She will. - Should we eat? I... - There she is! - She lives! - Sorry! I know it's been forever. It's this event I'm planning. It's only 50 people, but they are some of the wealthiest and most successful business professionals in all of Minneapolis. - So... - And how long do you have? Just a few weeks. And then you can take a break, right? Here's hoping. (Giggling) Janie: Well, then I think we should celebrate. - Yes! - Two weeks early? Celebrate that you managed to get away from work and Keith for the day to hang out. Plus, if I'm being honest, I've been craving a mimosa all week. Ooh, yes, please. Angie, you with us? I think I'll have to pass. What? Come on! Have a little fun. You've earned it. Uh, Samantha? What? I think that Angie might have a really good reason for not drinking. Wait! Really?! Angie? - Yes! - (Squealing) Yes, yes, yes, but I haven't told anybody yet. - Oh my god, Angie! - This is amazing! - What?! - (Excited squealing) - This is amazing! - Oh my god! (Giggling) - I know, I know. - Okay, so no mimosas. But we're definitely celebrating! But seriously, I haven't told anybody yet, and I don't want to tell anyone at work especially. I just... I want a chance to tell Cherise myself. My lips are sealed. It just... It kinda feels like everything is starting, you know? Like, I've always dreamed of having this perfect life with a perfect family, and, well, it's all happening. - Oh, Angie... - Samantha: Great! (Squealing) I can't wait! Another baby?! (Breathing heavily) (Panting) (Groaning) (Panting) (Pained groaning) - (Rattling) - No! No, no, no! No! Please help! Help! Somebody, help! (Screaming continues) Help me! Hello! Oh, I was just starting to worry about you. Hey, sorry. It took a while to get caught up. - Have a good time? - Yeah. Hey, uh... Listen. I didn't mean to tell them, but they figured out I'm pregnant. They just accidentally found out? They, what, read your mind? No, they ordered mimosas, and the second I said I didn't want any, they figured it out. And you couldn't, what, lie? Say you weren't in the mood? You know what a bad liar I am. They knew as soon as they saw my face. Okay. Well, I guess we can't take it back now. Well, you know what? Maybe... Maybe this is a good thing. You know, 'cause then we can tell your family, and then we can tell everyone at work. Yeah, I guess we have to. Okay, great, so why don't we call your parents, and then I will post something on social media. (Laughing) Everyone's gonna be so happy for us. Whatever you want. ♪ Everyone's gonna be so happy ♪ ♪ happy, happy ♪ Okay. ♪ This one's from Dylan. Pretty sure that's everyone at work. Keith: What did he say? "Congratulations, you're going to be amazing parents." - That's sweet. - (Angela sighing) Angela: Feels like the whole office is having a baby. I mean, I've already gotten 10 offers to babysit, and we're not even going to have this baby - for another six months. - (Phone chiming) (Music playing softly) Huh. Who's that one from? - An old friend from college. - Which one? Tyler. Didn't you and Tyler used to date? Angela: Like a million years ago. He actually used to be my first serious boyfriend. But you're still friends? Well, not real life friends. I mean, we haven't talked in about five years. But he follows you on social media. Well, sure, I mean, just to keep up with each other's lives. Don't you find that a little, uh, strange? Angela: Strange...? I mean, to be in contact with somebody after you break up? Well, it's not like we're talking, - it's just social media. - I mean, still, don't you think you should block him? (Laughing) What, block? No, babe. He just congratulated us, he hasn't done anything wrong. He's married, too. All right. If you're comfortable with it. Well, it's no big deal. Look, he's happy for us. Yeah, I believe you. Mmm! (Giggling) Sam, she's gonna throw me a baby shower at work. That's nice of her. Yeah. Ooh... That looks good. (Giggling) - Here you are. - Thank you.

Yeah, apparently some guy was trying doors and we forgot to lock ours. - That's terrifying. - Mm-hm. Yeah, I was totally freaked out. I was a complete mess the next day. Yeah, I would be too. How are you doing now? Better, yeah, I'm not jumping at every little sound, so... Aww, Angie. I bet you were happy that Keith was there. Yeah. What? Um, it's just...

Just please promise you'll work on things with Keith. You have to trust each other if you want to raise this baby together, and you can't start off keeping secrets like that. Yeah, you're right. No, no, no, that was just, like, a regular Tuesday lecture. But I'm sorry, back to Ellen marrying Donnie Dartman, okay, didn't they hate each other? According to them, they were flirting the whole time. No way, that's not what was happening, but sure. Tyler: That's what he said. So how are you and Keith? - Better, I think. - Yeah? I mean, we haven't had any more fights, you know, in the last two days. I mean, fighting isn't all bad. If you suddenly stop fighting, that's when you should worry. Hmm, is that what happened with you and Brenna? Todd from the gym who can bench 250 is what happened - to me and Brenna. - Oh... - I'm sorry. - It's all right. Or it's not, but you know, it will be. But listen, I do think fighting can be a good thing. - How is that? - Well, because it means you're expressing your feelings to him.

Everyone is going to know what you've done for this company. You... you're gonna leave a legacy. I don't think everyone is just going to forget me after a few months. I mean, it's maternity leave. It's not forever. I thought you said you were going to take your time. Right, I'm not going to set a return date. But I am going to come back. Yeah, I didn't know you already made that decision. - I thought you knew. - I thought... You were thinking maybe somewhere down the line. Maybe when the baby is old enough for school. I don't know what to say. I love my job. So you would send an infant to daycare. You're welcome to quit your job and stay home. Keith: I've been there for a decade, I run a whole branch of the company. And I want a chance to have a career, too. (Scoffing) I cannot believe you would spring this on me. (Stammering) I'm not springing anything on you. I've been saying this all along, if you would just listen.

He really wants me to stay home. Tyler: Yeah, well, it's not his choice. Plenty of women go back to work when they have a baby. - What decade is he living in? - Yeah, he just... He has all these ideas of what mothers are supposed to be. And I know a lot of women want that, and that's great, but it's just not me. Tyler: Yeah, well, if he's so against daycare, he can spend the money on a nanny. I promise, you're not the one being unreasonable here. - Thanks for talking to me. - Tyler: Of course. I love talking to you. Uh, well, I should get home. I've gotta face the music sometime, right? Tyler: Well, it will be okay. Just call me if you need anything, okay? Yeah, bye. Bye. ♪ (Door closing) - Angie: Hey. - I was worried. I know I'm not allowed to be worried about you, but this is ridiculous.

Babe, we can't keep having the same conversation over and over again. I can't just magically turn my brain off. I'm a protector, that is what I do. Yeah, but this stuff, I mean, work, pregnancy, baby, there is nothing to protect me from. There is no danger. Everything is fine. - What about the break-in? - That was obviously different. You're trying to lump everything together. - That was different. - What about Tyler? What about Tyler? (Sighing) You honestly expect me to believe there's nothing to be worried about here? Okay, yes, I... I should have told you that we were in touch, but no, there is nothing to worry about. Why are you talking to him?! Because I needed a friend, Keith! Okay?! I needed to vent. I couldn't have... I didn't want to do it to Janie and Sam or anybody that knew you, because I thought it wasn't fair to you, okay? But I'm sorry, okay? I shouldn't have called him. I shouldn't have done that. Yeah, I believe you. I believe you, I believe you when you say that there is nothing romantic going on there. - I really do. - Oh, thank you. But you have to understand, this isn't just about you? I mean, what happens when he gets it in his head that he wants to get back together with you? Oh my god, that is not going to happen. You don't know that, people do crazy things. (Exasperated laughter) Not everything is something to be scared of. He was in love with you, right? When you were dating? That was a long time ago. Those feelings do not just go away. If you broke up with him and he was in love with you, - maybe he still is. - We're just friends, okay? That's it. But... I understand if that makes you feel uncomfortable. Keith: Just promise me, the next time that we have an issue, you're going to come to me and not some stranger. - He's not a stranger. - Oh.

Yeah, but everyone told me that it was a bad idea to talk to him and I ignored them. And Keith warned me that Tyler was just going to take things too far. Okay. So you lay down the law. You tell him you don't feel the same and he needs to back off. - I did. - Then that's all you can do. Yeah, I just... I can't believe I was so stupid. Hey, you're not stupid. He doesn't live nearby. You're never gonna run into him, so just block him, and put this whole thing behind you. Yeah, I know you're right. What did Keith say when you told him? You did tell him, right? No, I've just been waiting for the right time. I was thinking maybe after the banquet. Angie, you have to tell him! I know, I know. The worst thing you can do is keep this a secret, because if he sees the email or finds out somehow, he's gonna think you were hiding it again and everything will be worse. Yeah. Yeah.

I'm gonna go mingle, I'm gonna hop up front - when Keith gets here. - Sounds good, thank you. - All right. - Thanks. Wow. If it isn't the woman of the hour. Hi. - Wow. - Yeah. Uh, did Cherise give you these? What? No, I thought you did. - Uh, there's a note. - Oh. Who are they from? Hey, uh, there's something... - I need to talk to you about. - Angie, oh my gosh! - This is incredible! - Hi! - You're killing it. - Thank you. Thank you so much. - Oh my gosh, everything okay? - Yeah, yeah. Just a little nervous. I can only imagine. Great work. - I 'm so proud of you! - Thank you. - Keith. - Hi. - Go get your seat. - Thank you. - So, listen. - Talk to me about what? - I was gonna talk to you... - Cherise: Thank you, everyone, for joining us tonight to fight food insecurity - in our community. - (Guests applaud) - Explain what? - Okay, uh, I'm gonna talk to you about it after the banquet, okay? I've just been trying to find the right time. Cherise: ...And architect of tonight's event, - Angela west. - (Crowd applauding) - Tell me what? - Take this. I will explain as soon as I get back okay? I will. Okay? Hi. (Guests applauding) Thank you, Cherise, for that kind introduction, and thank you for joining us tonight. (Applause continues) This year, 10% of households have to wonder where their next meal is coming from. Imagine being a child who is dreading the weekend because it means not getting your one hot meal a day. Or imagine being a mother who has to forgo her own meal so that she can feed her children. But tonight, we choose to stand up for those families. So thank you! Let's have a great night! (Applauding, cheering) I don't think Tyler was there tonight. I didn't see him. I just, I can't believe he did that. I mean, he always seemed so normal. This was exactly what I was trying to explain to you. You just... you can't tell with some people. Yeah, I guess not. It's just... why would he want me to think that he was there? I mean, that's so creepy. Hey, I'm sorry. Ah, it was... it's okay. No, no, no, it's not okay. Baby, you warned me that he would read too much into it and he did, and he just ended up ruining the dinner. No, he didn't ruin anything. That dinner was beautiful, and you raised so much money for the organization. Yeah, but I shouldn't have let him. No, you... you didn't let him do anything. You just... you saw the best in him, that's all. That's one of the things I love about you. You always see the best in people. You're just... You were just wrong this time. Yeah, but you weren't. You told me this is what was going to happen and I didn't listen. I should have listened to you. Well, how about you keep being the optimist that you are, and I will always be there to step in and keep you safe. - I like that plan. - Good, I like it too. You know what? Hopefully it just doesn't happen again, because I told him that I'm not talking to him anymore, and I blocked his number, and I think once I don't respond to the flowers, - then he'll stop. - Yeah. There's that optimism. (Water running) (Cell phone chiming) (Cell phone chiming) (Angie panting) (Whimpering) (Breathing heavily) (Breathing heavily) (Breathing heavily) Okay, okay. Okay. Where do we put this? Where... what do I do? (Breathing heavily) Okay. Okay, baby. (Frustrated groaning) Okay, okay, okay. (Breathing heavily) Janie: Have you seen these Dinosaur feet. Angie:Dinosaur feet! You're making me want another one. (Sighing happily) I just... Three months and she'll be here, and I'll get to dress her up in everything. Did you say "her"? Did I? I'm pretty sure you did. Is there something you want to tell me? Okay, yes. I got an ultrasound a couple weeks ago, it's a girl. Oh, a little girl?! Oh my... Oh, I'm so excited. I mean, obviously, I would have been excited either way, but I mean, she just... She feels so much more real now, you know? I feel like I can picture her and her little feet, her little hands, and little squishy face, and just... ah, anyways. (Laughing) With who her parents are, she is going to be gorgeous. Aww. And I plan to buy her a full wardrobe. Aw, I know auntie Janie would. - Oh, uh, one thing. - What? Just please don't tell anyone. And definitely don't post on social media. We're just, um, trying to keep everything private, you know? - So that's still happening? - Yeah, well... It's slowed down. I only got one text last week. Still, that's messed up. And there's no way for you to block him? No, he uses a different number every time. It must be a computer program or something, 'cause I doubt he's just buying brand new phones. Janie: And he still claims to be in love with you? That's what he says. Honestly, at this point, I think he's delusional. It's really, really creeping me out. Janie: I'm really sorry you're going through this. Yeah, thanks. I just... I wish it would stop. I'm home! Hey. How was your morning? This arrived an hour ago. There's no address. Must have delivered it himself. (Tense music) ♪ ♪ Can I help you? Yes, we're looking to report a crime. - What type of crime? - Uh, someone's stalking me. I'm sorry to hear that. Uh, is detective McCoy working today? We talked to her before. - Yeah, uh, Layla? - Yeah? These folks need to speak with you. Oh, hey. Come on back. It's okay. So what happened? Was it another break-in? Well, um, my ex is stalking me. All right. What is he doing exactly? Well, he won't leave me alone, he texts me constantly. - Do you have the texts? - No, I keep deleting them. Is it just the texting? I think he might be following me, because he sent a picture of myself at an event that he shouldn't have been able to get into. Are you sure he took the pictures himself? Is it possible someone else shared it to social media? I... I guess it's possible. But he dropped off a package at my house. - What kind of package? - A Teddy bear. DET. McCoy: Why a Teddy bear? Well, I'm pregnant, and it was a pink "it's a girl" bear. Keith: No one knows we're having a girl. He must have found out through the doctor or something. Well... I may have told my friend Janie. What? I can't believe you would do that. I mean, it was probably her. No, it wasn't! It wasn't her. How else would he have found out? Because it was today, I mean, it couldn't have been more than an hour until the package arrived. There's no way she could have told him fast enough for him to buy a bear and drop it off at the house before I get home. That does sound pretty unlikely, but still, it's not a crime to mail a present. He didn't mail it, there was no postage on the box. He must have dropped it off himself. Does he live nearby? No, we dated back in college, he lives in Michigan. Okay. Has he threatened you? No, but he keeps telling me he's in love with me, and that we belong together, we're supposed to be together. - I mean... - Look, I sympathize, I really do. I'm sure this is a stressful situation, but as of right now, you do not qualify for a restraining order, let alone to press charges. So there's nothing you can do? Start keeping everything, right? Every text, every email. This is all evidence now. If he starts to escalate or you actually see him, - please give me a call. - Yeah. Thanks for all your help. Wait, so we actually have to wait until he does something? As of right now, I don't believe he's committed a crime. Yeah, but isn't it, I don't know, part of your job to prevent crimes before they happen? I understand you're scared. I wish there was more I could do. Okay, she can't help us. Let's go. I told you they weren't gonna help. Yeah, I can't believe that. Those people are absolutely useless. It's just like after the break-in. A lot of sympathy, but sorry, nothing we can do. Yeah, I really thought she would do something, you know? A restraining order at least, something. Yeah, it doesn't matter. We won't bother next time. If the police can't protect you, I will. I will make sure you are as safe as it's possible for a person to be. Security system, cameras, whatever. Just trust me, okay? Um... This is a prepaid phone. Only I have the number. That way he'll stop bothering you. Uh, but I have to be able to call other people. Hey, well, keep the list as small as possible. Okay. I just... I hate the idea that he could be watching me - at any time. - Hey, hey. We're gonna figure this out, okay? Make sure you don't keep the same schedule every day. I'm gonna be with you as much as I possibly can. Angie: Thanks. (Breathing heavily) It's okay, baby. It's okay. ♪ ♪ - The lunch salads, maybe? - I'm into that. - Yeah. - We should order for the table - and then we'll see. - Yeah. - Hey! - Hey. Hi. It's so good to see you. We miss you around the office. Angie. What? Oh, I miss you guys, too. How's everything going with... You know. - Uh, nothing lately. - That's great. How is everything with you guys? - Good. - Yeah, pretty good. Ryan actually got some good news at work. - Samantha: Nice. - Oh. (Cell phone ringing) Samantha: Who is that? I don't know, nobody has this number. (Cell phone ringing) Maybe you should just turn it off. Yeah, yeah. Uh, sorry, what's...

Janie: He's been working so hard for months, - I'm just so excited. - Samantha: Good for him! - I can't wait. - That's great news. (Gasping) - What's wrong? - I don't see anyone there. - Is it Tyler? - I have to go, I'm sorry. Hey, hey, take a breath. Tell us what happened. Janie: Yeah, we can help you! Keith is coming to get me, okay? I will call you later. - Samantha: Angie! - Angie! I promise I will call you... (Shrieking) Oh, sorry. Janie: Text me when you get home! Yeah.

Hey! Leave her alone! Look, man, she dropped her keys. I was just trying to give them back. I'm sorry, I-I-I thought you were someone else. I was just trying to do something nice. Keith: Thank you. Your girl is paranoid, man. Keith: Hey, what's going on? What happened? It was Tyler, he was in the restaurant. - You saw him? - No! But he knew what I was wearing, and then this guys started chasing me, and then I thought... Oh, you must have been so scared. Babe, babe. Yeah, it was a misunderstanding, but I was so sure - that it was him! - It's okay, I'm here. You're safe now, babe. How did he even get my number? I don't know. I didn't give my number to anybody. Okay, we'll go straight home. No, no, no, I want to go to the police station. I need to talk to that officer again. - Are you sure? - Yes, because he texted me, and she can read it herself now. She's going to have to take me seriously this time. I think this is enough to get you a restraining order, at least. Now it might take some time to track him down, but it sounds like he's in town if he's been following you. Send me all the information you have on him. I'll call you once we locate him. How long will that take? Well, I'll get started on this right now. Hopefully he's staying some place under his own name, but if he doesn't want to be found, - it might take a while. - Thank you so much. My wife and I really appreciate it. It's my pleasure. I'm just sorry you're going through this. Yeah. Well, thank you, detective. - You guys take care. - Thank you. - That was good. - Yeah. You feel up for some dinner? Honestly, I'm pretty tired. I could imagine, you had a hard day. Yeah, I'm just so happy the police are handling it, you know? This will soon be over. I don't want you to get your hopes up. Detective McCoy said it may take some time before they track him down. Will you just let me be optimistic for one night please? You're right, didn't mean to bring you down. I know. But hey, as soon as they catch him, then you don't have to spend every waking minute looking after me. Wouldn't that be nice? I don't mind looking after you. It's my favourite thing in the world. (Sighing) Sorry. I just feel like this day is finally catching up to me. Well, how about you go relax and I go make us some dinner? - Hmm? - Okay. Are you sure you don't need any help? Nope, call you when it's ready. Angie: Thank you. ♪ ♪ Nothing looks different, he didn't take anything? No, I don't think so. It doesn't look like he forced his way in. Wait, do you think that he was here when we got home? He was probably here when you came to see me at the station. No, no! I don't want to picture him in our house. Do we have to do this right now? My wife is tired and upset. DET. McCoy: I understand, and we are doing everything we can to find Mr. Watson. But according to his office, he's out of the country. Now obviously he could have lied, but while we sort that out, I just think it's best if you get out of this house. Do you have family that you can stay with? Do you have anyone in town? No, but, um, we could to a friend... We'll go to a hotel. All right, just call me with the information - once you get settled. - Can't thank you enough. I won't let him get away with this, okay? Mm-hm. Thank you. ♪ Thank you. - We found him. - Who? - Tyler Watson? - Yes, ma'am. Well, that was quick. All right, let's go pick him up. - No can do. - Why not? Well, it's like his office said. He's out of the country. And you verified that? I just got off the phone with us customs. He entered Spain two weeks ago and hasn't left. No way he's the one breaking into their house. What? Lane: I guess the guy could be cyber stalking her, and, I don't know, is paying someone to deliver the packages and what not, but... No, that doesn't sound likely, does it? I also spoke to Tyler. He told me he got a text a couple of months ago from Angela west, telling him she didn't want to talk anymore, and he hasn't bothered her since. So somebody is lying. They didn't call you, right? They never told us where they were staying tonight. No, nothing. Well, when we find out where they're at, I will stop by and see if I can get to the bottom of this. Meanwhile, we need to start figuring out where those texts and emails are coming from. Someone has been sending them, and if it wasn't Tyler Watson, then we need to figure out who. Okay. (Yawning) Hey there, sleepyhead. Perfect timing, we're here. - I don't feel so good. - Oh, that will pass. Wait, what do you mean? Oh, don't be angry, but I gave you a little something to help you sleep last night. Uh, don't worry, it was entirely non-toxic. I would never do anything to endanger the baby. - Wait, what? - You were exhausted, but you were too worked up. I wanted to make sure you didn't get too stressed that something happened to the baby. I don't understand. Where are we? This is your surprise. - (Moaning) - Hey. - (Moaning) - Hey, I got you. I got you. Wait... See? What, you... What is this place? Some place safe. You rented it last night, or...? I bought it. Two months ago! Wait. I've been getting it ready for us. - But why? I don't... - Because of Tyler. Because he wouldn't leave you alone. Now I was hoping we wouldn't need to use it like this, I figured it could be a vacation home. Wait, you... you bought a house without telling me? It's a surprise. Besides, I couldn't risk Tyler overhearing us. I'm pretty sure he was bugging the house. Um... well, we should tell detective McCoy where we are. We don't need anything from her! Besides, there's no reception all the way out here. I don't want to stay here. Just come in, give it a chance. No, I... uh, I want to go home. Hey, hey, hey. Okay, we can... we can go to the hotel, like you said. You think he couldn't find us in a hotel? I'm telling you, if we hadn't left Minneapolis, he would never leave us alone. (Laughing nervously) I'm sorry, I don't understand. I don't... okay, phew. Hey. We can't just walk away from our lives, Keith. -I mean, what about our friends? -Okay, don't you understand? This is the only way for me to keep you safe. There are always going to be Tylers out there who want to hurt you. You think that cop is going to protect you? She is just trying to complicate things. I am your family. You're my responsibility. Oh, come on! Just take a look. Give it a chance. I promise, you're gonna love it. Hey, any word on that stalker case? No, nothing yet. Oh, wait. Lane? It traced some of the messages back to an ip address. Great. Let's go get a bad guy. (Scoffing) The messages were sent from inside the Wests' home. Do you think it was a scam? A scam for what? Well, I heard about this case once where a woman pretended to have a stalker to get her husband's attention. I always got the sense she wanted a little less attention from her husband. What if it was the opposite? What if he made her think she had a stalker so she'd become more dependent on him. So he uses this Tyler guy as a bogeyman to keep her afraid. (Gasping) There never was a stalker, there was just a controlling husband who... Well, he wanted to play Saviour. She has been scared of a stalker this whole time, and now she's alone with him.

It's rustic and it's off-grid. - Lane: How far away? - It's far. - I'm leaving right now. - Are you sure? I mean, it could be a different Tyler Watson.

Keith: There will be plenty of time for that, and I think you'll be surprised. Raising a kid out here in all the fresh air, I don't think she'll be getting sick too often. Angie: What if when she needs to go to school? Keith: We're smart people. I am sure we can teach her everything she needs to know. So you're just gonna keep her here forever?
