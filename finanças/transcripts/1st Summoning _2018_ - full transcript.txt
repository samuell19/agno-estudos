Subtitles by explosiveskull [SCREAMS AND GROANS] - [LESLIE] SHIT! YOU SCARED ME. - WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I JUST THOUGHT I'D DO THE HONORS OF UNBOXING IT AND SETTING IT UP, GET SOME HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE BEFORE THE GUYS GOT HERE. - WHAT MEMORY CARD ARE YOU USING? - IT'S BLANK. I CHECKED. - DID YOU CHANGE THE DEFAULT SETTINGS? - RELAX, BABE. I'M NOT GONNA FUCK UP YOUR CAMERA. I'M SORRY. I'M JUST A LITTLE NERVOUS. IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO THIS STUFF AND I CAN'T RETURN IT, I WILL BE HOMELESS. YOU KNOW THERE'S A SOLUTION TO THAT. YOU COULD GET AN ACTUAL JOB. THIS IS MY JOB. I HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY FOCUSED ON MY CAREER. WHY DO YOU THINK I SPEND SO MUCH TIME TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT FOLLOW-UP PROJECT? FOLLOW-UP PROJECT? WHEN DID YOU BECOME SO PRETENTIOUS? "NO TURNING BACK" WAS GOOD, BUT IT HAD A VERY NICHE AUDIENCE. I WANNA MAKE A FILM WITH A MORE WIDESPREAD COMMERCIAL APPEAL. MMM, YOU THINK THIS IS THE ONE TO BET THE FARM ON? I'VE BEEN DEVELOPING THIS IDEA FOR MONTHS, AND EVERY BIG FILM FESTIVAL DEADLINE IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. IT'S NOW OR NEVER. OTHERWISE I'LL BE WASHING DISHES AT DENNY'S FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. [CHUCKLES] YOU'VE NO IDEA HOW MUCH I WOULD PAY TO SEE THAT. I JUST REFUSE TO COMPROMISE. DOES THAT ALSO APPLY TO YOUR WARDROBE? 'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE... THOSE FUCKING SHOES. I MEAN, AT LEAST GET, LIKE, A NEW SHIRT OR SOMETHING. IT COULD HELP YOUR APPROACHABILITY. WELL, THAT'S WHY I HAVE YOU. HMM, AND TO THINK I WAS HERE FOR MY TALENT. LOOK, YOU'RE GOING TO DO GREAT. THIS FILM IS GOING TO EXPLODE. EVERYTHING IS GONNA WORK OUT. TRUST ME. JUST REMEMBER TO HIT RECORD NEXT TIME. WHAT? [LESLIE] WHATCHA DOING THERE? JUST SETTING UP THE GOPRO TO GET SOME GOOD TRANSITIONAL SHOTS. - [CAR HORN HONKING] - FUCKING MORONS. GUYS WEREN'T THINKING ABOUT LEAVING WITHOUT US, WERE YA? [LESLIE CHUCKLES] YOU WEREN'T THINKING ABOUT BEING ON TIME FOR ONCE, WERE YOU? HAD TO GRAB THE GOODS? HEY, MAN, THANKS FOR JUMPING ON BOARD AGAIN AND AGREEING TO BE PART OF THIS. IT REALLY MEANS A LOT. WHATEVER I CAN DO TO HELP. DID YOU GET THE MICS? YEAH, I GOT THE MICS. [LESLIE] AWW, LOOK AT YOU GUYS GETTING ALONG. IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED THAN POINT AND CLICK, ISN'T IT? [LESLIE] NO, IT'S JUST LIKE PHOTOGRAPHY. I'M JUST TAKING 24 PICTURES A SECOND. WOULD YOU MIND TURNING IT OFF JUST FOR A MINUTE? - WHY? - HEY, PUT THIS ON. - WHAT'S THE CATCH? - THREE BUCKS A PUFF. DUDE, I'M NOT SPENDING THREE BUCKS FOR THAT. COME ON, MAN. JUST PUT IT ON FOR THE FUN. - IT'S FREE. - [LESLIE] PRODUCT PLACEMENT. - SO CLEVER. - YEAH. - YOU GUYS READY? - YEAH. HERE. PUT THAT ON. [LESLIE] WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO YOUR FOOT? [SIGHS] DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. - GOT THE SHOT. - [CHUCKLES] DUMBASS. [LESLIE] AS YOU CAN SEE TO OUR LEFT, WE HAVE THE OZARK MOUNTAINS, KNOWN FOR THEIR RUGGED BEAUTY, MANY UNBLEMISHED CAVERNS, AND A NEVERENDING SUPPLY OF METH HEADS. SPECIES INDIGENOUS TO THESE PARTS INCLUDE MARK, OUR FEARLESS LEADER. AND IF YOU LOOK VERY CLOSELY YOU CAN SEE TWO BUDDING FILMMAKERS IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT. HERE WE HAVE ACE, OUR LEAD CAMERAMAN, AKA THE HUNTER OF THE PACK. AND OVER HERE WE HAVE RYAN, THE OMEGA OF THE PACK, WHOSE RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDE PROTECTING, SCOUTING, AND OF COURSE, SEEING TO THE NEEDS OF THE ALPHA. WHY DO I HAVE TO BE THE ONE WHO SEES TO THE NEEDS? WHY CAN'T IT BE ACE? 'CAUSE I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO HASN'T SLEPT WITH HER. WHAT? 'CAUSE I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO HASN'T SLEPT WITH HER. I MEAN, YOU GUYS USED TO DATE, RIGHT? SERIOUSLY, WAY TO MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A WHORE. FOURTH WALL. HELLO? [RYAN] OH NO, BY ALL MEANS, BURN THROUGH ALL THE MEDIA BEFORE WE EVEN GET THERE. YOU GONNA BE A LITTLE BITCH LIKE THIS THE WHOLE TIME, RYAN? [ACE] OH, SHIT. DON'T WORRY, RYAN, LESLIE'S GOT THE RIGHT IDEA. WE NEED TO KEEP SHOOTING. WE NEVER KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA CATCH. EASY FOR YOU TO SAY. YOU'RE NOT THE ONE THAT HAS TO SIFT THROUGH HOURS OF USELESS FOOTAGE. DUDE, WE'RE ABOUT TO GO SHOOT THE DEVIL IN A FUCKING WAREHOUSE. DOCUMENTING OUR FAILURE IS THE ONLY THING WE GOT. SO NEITHER ONE OF YOU BELIEVE IN ANY OF THIS. [RYAN] I CHOOSE TO REMAIN UNAFFILIATED. IT'S ALWAYS THE, UH, NONBELIEVERS WHO END UP IN THE FETAL POSITION FIRST. [CHUCKLES] OKAY. WE HAVE A BETTER CHANCE AT FINDING BIGFOOT. [LAUGHS] HEY, GUYS, ARE YOU GONNA BE WANTING THIS ALL ON ONE CHECK? - SEPARATE, PLEASE. - [WAITRESS] OKAY. I GUESS DAYS OF MEAL, CREDIT, AND COPY ARE OVER. HERE'S THE MANTRA YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO RECITE. [SIGHS] "DARK FORCES BOTH BLACK AND WHITE REACHING OUT..." [CHUCKLES] WE'RE ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO READ THIS OUT LOUD? YEAH. I MEAN, ONE OF US HAS TO. [RYAN] GREAT. SO ONE OF US HAS TO SUMMON THE DEVIL. ANY TAKERS? - YOU GOT IT, MAN. - NO, NO, MAN. IT SHOULD BE YOU. YOU'RE THE MOST PRAGMATIC ONE HERE. SO, ALL THREE OF YOU ARE TOO SCARED TO DO IT? WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A VOLUNTEER. AH, NO. I WOULD PREFER TO RETAIN OWNERSHIP OF MY SOUL. - RIGHT. - HEY, ACE, GIVE ME YOUR KNIFE. THIS CAN'T BE GOOD. WE'RE LITERALLY GONNA DRAW STRAWS FOR IT? YEAH. I MEAN, NONE OF US WANNA DO IT. SO IT'S ONLY FAIR. ALL RIGHT. â™ª BOW CHICKA BOW WOW [ACE] YEAH. THE CHOSEN ONE. OF COURSE I AM. [MAN] SON OF A BITCH! UH, SIR, EXCUSE ME. NICE TO MEET YOU. - UH, MARK. - JEFF. YES, WE'RE IN TOWN ASKING PEOPLE AROUND ABOUT THE MILLBROOK FACTORY. - [LESLIE] I THINK... IF I KNEW... - [RYAN] WHAT BUTTONS DID YOU PRESS? - CAN YOU HEAR ME? - YEAH. DON'T HIT IT. I'M SORRY. UM... [RYAN] WHAT COULD YOU TELL US ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE WAREHOUSE? UM, NOT MUCH. I KNOW WHERE IT'S AT. IT OPENED IN THE WINTER OF '74 AND SHUT DOWN IN THE FALL OF '79. I KNOW IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR QUITE SOME TIME, BUT IT'S... IT'S BEEN ABANDONED FOR A WHILE. I KNOW IT WAS SOME TYPE OF DISTRIBUTION CENTER - OKAY. - AND I DON'T KNOW WHY IT SHUT DOWN. I ASSUME... I ASSUME THEY DISTRIBUTED THEIR JOBS SOMEPLACE ELSE. - YEAH. - SEEMS TO BE THE AMERICAN WAY. IT WAS A VICTIM OF CORPORATE BUYOUT. YEAR AFTER YEAR, BIG COMPANIES BUYING UP PROFITABLE SMALL COMPANIES TO TAKE OVER THEIR... THEIR BUSINESS, AND, UNFORTUNATELY, HARRISON KINDA LOST IN THAT. HAVE YOU HEARD OF ANY RUMORS OF, UH... SAY, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY, - OR SUPE... - [LESLIE] UH, SUPERNATURAL. - SUPER... - [LESLIE] JUST ASK IT AGAIN. [SIGHS] UM... SATANIC PEOPLE GO OVER THERE TO THAT LAND AND WORSHIP, AND THEN, UH, THEY CAME IN AND BUILT THE FACTORY ON TOP OF IT. SO, THE RUMOR, LEGEND OR WHATEVER IS THAT IT'S... IT'S, YOU KNOW, CURSED. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. I KNOW THAT, UH, WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE BY YOURSELF OR AT NIGHT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, THERE'S A LOT OF SOUNDS. A LOT OF... IT'S KIND OF AN EERIE PLACE TO BE AT IN THE DARK. SPOOKY PLACE. SO... SO, YOU'VE... YOU'VE BEEN IN THERE. BEEN IN THERE, YEAH. THERE WAS STUFF SPRAYED ON THE WALL, AND IF YOU GO DOWN TO THE TUNNEL UNDERNEATH IT, THERE'S SOME... THAT'S HOW YOU GOTTA GET IN, YOU KNOW. I DON'T KNOW OF ANY DEATHS ON THE PROPERTY. UM, THERE'VE BEEN A LOT OF INJURIES OVER THE YEARS. MY DADDY HAD A FRIEND WHO... WHO PASSED AWAY, ACTUALLY, AT THE... AT THE WAREHOUSE. - OH, REALLY? - KINDA WEIRD, TOO. HE WAS FEELING SICK AND WENT TO THE BATHROOM AND NEVER CAME BACK. I'VE ACTUALLY ONLY HEARD ONE STORY ABOUT IT. - [MARK] OH, REALLY? - YOUNG GENTLEMAN, THAT'S A FRIEND OF MINE, WHOSE MOM WORKED THERE SAID SOME... - SHE WOULD HEAR HER NAME BEING CALLED. - [MARK] OKAY. [MARK] DOES THE DATE OCTOBER 6TH MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU? NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE. CAN YOU TELL US IF THE DATE OCTOBER 6TH MEANS ANYTHING TO YOU? DID IT SHUT DOWN ON THE SIXTH? IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING? [MARK] OCTOBER 6TH, DOES THAT MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU? OTHER THAN BEING TOMORROW, IT DOESN'T MEAN MUCH TO ME. THAT'S MY WIFE AND MINE'S ANNIVERSARY, YEAH. YOU SHOULD TALK TO PASTOR YOUNGBLOOD. HE'S BEEN AROUND HERE FOR GENERATIONS. HE'S VERY POPULAR. HE'S AT SECOND BAPTIST CHURCH, JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN. HE'S THE ONE THAT MARRIED ME AND MY WIFE. MIGHT WANNA STAY AWAY FROM THERE. YEAH, I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND. - THANK YOU. - THANK YOU. [PASTOR YOUNGBLOOD] BROTHERS, THERE ARE EVILS JUST BEYOND THOSE DOORS, AND THEY WILL TRY TO PERSUADE YOU, SEDUCE YOU, MANIPULATE YOU INTO DOING THEIR BIDDING, BUT I URGE YOU TO HOLD FAST. EVEN THE PRINCE OF THE POWER OF THE AIR SHALL STAND BEFORE THE ALMIGHTY AND HAVE HIS DAY OF JUDGMENT. BUT MAN ALONE CANNOT OVERCOME TEMPTATION. NO. NO, ONLY WITH HIS WORD IN YOUR HEART CAN YOU BREAK FREE FROM THE CHAINS OF IMPURITY THAT WILL SURELY LEAD YOU DOWN THE PATH TO ETERNAL DAMNATION. [ACE, WHISPERS] OH SHIT! YOU KNOW WHAT I SPEAK OF, BROTHERS? I KNOW YOU HEAR THE WORD. HI. HELLO. ME AND MY FRIENDS ARE MAKING A FILM ABOUT THE HISTORY OF HARRISON, AND WOULD LOVE TO GET A FORMAL INTERVIEW WITH A MEMBER OF ONE OF ITS MOST PROMINENT FAMILIES. CERTAINLY. I'LL JUST FINISH TENDING TO MY FLOCK AND THEN WE CAN STEP INSIDE. - OH, IN THE CHURCH? - YES. I LIVE RIGHT DOWNSTAIRS. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. [ACE] COOL. OOH, I LOVE THIS SHOW. [SNAPPING FINGERS] MY APOLOGIES. I WASN'T EXPECTING COMPANY AT THIS LATE HOUR. [MARK] WELL, WE'RE ALMOST FINISHED SETTING UP THE SHOT, SO IF YOU JUST WANNA TAKE A SEAT, WE'LL GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED. ALL GOOD. ALL SET? [ACE] READY WHEN YOU ARE. [LESLIE] OKAY, I'M ROLLING. [MARK] I UNDERSTAND YOUR FAMILY USED TO OWN ALL THE LAND IN THIS AREA. IS THAT CORRECT? YES, THAT IS CORRECT. MY GREAT GRANDFATHER'S FAMILY MOVED HERE AFTER THE CIVIL WAR. HIS FATHER DIED WHILE FIGHTING WITH BRAGG'S ARMY OF TENNESSEE. THEY MOVED HERE SHORTLY AFTER AND SET THE FOUNDATION FOR THE HARRISON WE ALL KNOW TODAY. [MARK] YOU SEEM TO BE QUITE THE HISTORY BUFF. MY FAMILY HAS ALWAYS KEPT EXTENSIVE RECORDS OF OUR HISTORY IN HOPES OF PRESERVING OUR HERITAGE. [MARK] I TAKE IT YOU'VE LIVED HERE YOUR ENTIRE LIFE. BORN AND RAISED. [MARK] WHICH MEANS YOU WERE HERE WHEN THE PLANT OPENED IN 1974. YES. I WAS VERY YOUNG. [MARK] SO, WHEN THE PLANT WAS CLOSED BACK IN 1979, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAD, UH, SUSPICIONS THAT MYSTERIOUS THINGS WERE HAPPENING AS A RESULT OF RITUALS CONDUCTED HERE ON THE LAND YEARS AGO. LIVING SO CLOSE, DID YOU EVER EXPERIENCE OR SEE ANYTHING THAT WAS UNUSUAL? NOTHING PARTICULARLY NOTEWORTHY. [MARK] NO STRANGE ACTIVITY OR UNEXPLAINED PHENOMENON? MY CHILDHOOD WAS VERY UNEVENTFUL. WHAT ABOUT YOUR PARENTS? DID THEY EVER TELL YOU ABOUT ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY THEY EVER SAW? YES, THEY DID. ONE YEAR AT THE COUNTY FAIR, BILL DORSEY HAD A DOG THAT COULD PLAY PIANO. [CHUCKLES] ALL RIGHT, DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE LEGENDS SURROUNDING MILLBROOK? [PASTOR YOUNGBLOOD] EXCUSE ME? THERE'S AN OLD LEGEND THAT IF YOU GO INSIDE THE FACILITY AT MIDNIGHT ON THE SIXTH OF OCTOBER, PERFORM A CERTAIN RITUAL, YOU CAN ASK FOR WHATEVER YOU WANT AS LONG AS YOU'RE WILLING TO PAY THE PRICE. SURELY YOU MUST KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT IT. IN TIMES OF FEAR AND UNCERTAINTY, PEOPLE TEND TO COOK UP ALL SORTS OF IMAGINATIVE NOTIONS AS A COPING MECHANISM. [MARK] SO YOU'RE SAYING NONE OF IT IS REAL? I'M SIMPLY SAYING THAT THINGS CAN BE BLOWN OUT OF PROPORTION. [MARK] OKAY, SO YOU HAVE AT LEAST HEARD OF IT. THERE WAS A COUPLE AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY, A HUSBAND AND WIFE AND THEIR THREE CHILDREN. THE WIFE BECAME VERY ILL. HER CHANCES OF RECOVERY GREW SLIMMER AND SLIMMER. HER HUSBAND EXHAUSTED EVERY AVAILABLE OPTION BEFORE RESORTING TO THE PRACTICES OF THOSE OF WHOM YOU SPEAK. HE PARTICIPATED IN THE RITUAL AND WAS GUARANTEED HER FULL RECOVERY, BUT IN EXCHANGE HE HAD TO SURRENDER THE SOULS OF HIS THREE CHILDREN. THEY WERE FOUND BOUND IN STOCKS, HAVING BEEN AXED IN THE HEAD UNTIL DEATH. HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL THIS? [PASTOR YOUNGBLOOD] LIKE I SAID, MY FAMILY HAS KEPT VERY EXTENSIVE RECORDS OF OUR HISTORY. SO THESE ARE YOUR RELATIVES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT? DISTANT RELATIVES, YES. I'M NOT SURE OF THE LINEAGE, BUT THEY ARE BURIED IN OUR OLD FAMILY CEMETERY RIGHT HERE ON THE CHURCH GROUNDS. THAT'S GREAT! IS THERE ANY WAY WE COULD GET A HOLD OF THOSE RECORDS FOR OUR FILM? WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME FOR A MOMENT? - [LAUGHS] - [WHISPERS] STOP IT. - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - [ACE] HEY, SHH. YOU HEAR THAT? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [PASTOR YOUNGBLOOD] YOU CAN'T COME OUT THERE. THEY CAN'T SEE YOU. NO ONE CAN SEE YOU. THEY SAW YOU IN THE CHURCH. THEY DID NOT LIKE IT. THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO YOU WERE. THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WE'VE DONE. THAT NEVER HAPPENED. THEY'RE ASKING ABOUT STUFF. [MARK, WHISPERS] WHAT THE FUCK? I'M READY TO CONTINUE. UM, I'M SORRY... WHAT ABOUT THE RECORDS? OH, THE RECORDS. I'M AFRAID THEY'RE PRIVATE. THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN GET A QUICK LOOK? WOULD ANYONE LIKE SOMETHING MORE TO DRINK? [RYAN] THAT IS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF WHY I DON'T GO TO CHURCH. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT GUY IS ACTUALLY IN CHARGE OF THIS PLACE? [LAUGHS] CREEPED ME THE FUCK OUT. I WAS NOT ABOUT TO DRINK THAT TEA. HE WAS FULL OF SHIT. PLAYING IT UP FOR CAMERA. THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO KNOW FOR SURE. - WHICH IS WHAT? - THE CEMETERY. - WHAT ABOUT THE CEMETERY? - WE HAVE TO FIND THE CEMETERY. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK IT EVEN EXISTS? WELL, IF WE CAN FIND IT, AT LEAST WE'LL HAVE SOMETHING TO BACK UP HIS STORY WITH. HE WOULDN'T EVEN SHOW US A FUCKING PHOTO ALBUM. I DOUBT HE'S GONNA GIVE US A GRAND TOUR OF... WE DON'T NEED HIM. WE CAN JUST COME BACK TOMORROW. - WE'LL FIND IT ON OUR OWN. - NO, NO, NO, NO. - IT HAS TO BE NOW. - WELL, IT'S PITCH BLACK OUTSIDE. [ACE] OH, LET'S DO IT. IT'LL LOOK SO CREEPY. COME ON, MAN. FUCK, YEAH. - NO, THANK YOU? - REALLY? - DUDE, TAKE A SHOT. - WE'RE WORKING. - ONE OF US HAS TO KEEP... - ALWAYS FUCKING WORKING. - TAKE IT. - TURNED DOWN A... GUYS, THAT'S FIRST. - [ACE] OH, LAME. - ACE, HOW'S YOUR BATTERY LOOKING? - IT'S GOOD. - TO BE CLEAR, MARK, I WASN'T SUGGESTING TRESPASSING. OKAY. NO, IF WE CAN MAKE IT PAST THE CHURCH WITHOUT BEING SEEN, WE SHOULD BE GOOD. ALL RIGHT, NOW, FROM WHAT I CAN TELL, THE PLACE IS NOT FAR FROM HERE AT ALL. [RYAN] WHAT, DID YOU HIT THE "FEELIN' LUCKY" BUTTON ON GOOGLE MAPS? [MARK] THERE'S A SMALL CLEARING JUST THROUGH THE WOODS. THIS HAS TO BE IT. [RYAN] SO YOU'RE TELLING ME WE NEED TO GO TRUDGING THROUGH THE WOODS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT BASED ON THE WORD OF SOME BATSHIT CRAZY PREACHER AND AN OUT-OF-DATE RUSSIAN SATELLITE? [MARK] COME ON. [ACE] FUCKING HATE THE WOODS. [LESLIE] FUCK! GOD, MARK! [LESLIE] WHERE ARE WE FUCKING GOING, MARK? [ACE SNIFFLING] OH, SHIT. HEY, YOU GUYS. [ACE] COME OVER HERE. I THINK I FOUND IT. [MARK] IS THIS IT? CAN YOU GET IT? COME ON, MAN. [ACE] THIS IS DEFINITELY IT, RIGHT? [LESLIE] HOW OLD ARE THESE FUCKING GRAVES? [ACE] YEAH. LOOK HOW OLD THESE ARE. [RYAN] GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE.

[ACE] HEY, HEY, LESLIE, COME CHECK THIS OUT. LOOK AT THIS. LOOK AT THIS. 1801. HEY, GUYS, LOOK AT THIS. ARE YOU GUYS SEEING THESE? [LESLIE] WHAT THE FUCK? WHERE DO YOU THINK THESE CAME FROM? [LESLIE] WHAT THE FUCK IS ALL THIS STUFF? WHO DO YOU THINK PUT 'EM HERE? THESE THREE DON'T HAVE DATES AND THEY'RE THE SMALLEST ONES, WHICH MEANS THEY'RE PROBABLY CHILDREN. WHAT IF THESE ARE THE KIDS? [LESLIE] OKAY, I AM OFFICIALLY CREEPED OUT NOW. [ACE] COOL. LOOK AT THAT. WHAT? [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] - TURN OFF YOUR LIGHTS. - [LESLIE] FUCK! - [MARK] ACE, TURN OFF YOUR LIGHTS! - [ACE] I CAN'T. [ACE] SHIT! [ALL BREATHING HEAVILY] - [WHISTLING] - [LESLIE, WHISPERS] FUCK! [WHISTLING] [WHISTLING STOPS] [WHISTLING] [LESLIE, WHISPERING] FUCK! WE NEED TO GET BACK TO THE RV NOW! - [LESLIE] WHICH WAY IS IT? - IT'S THIS WAY. COME ON. - HEY. - WHAT? - I HAVE AN IDEA. - NO. NO MORE IDEAS, MARK. - STOP. - THE RECORDS. NO. ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND? WE CAN'T BREAK INTO A CHURCH, LET ALONE FILM IT. HE INVITED US IN, OKAY. SO, NO ONE HAS TO KNOW WE WENT BACK. [ACE] OH, DUDE, LET ME DO IT. SERIOUSLY? [ACE] YEAH. COME ON. HEY, MARK, WHAT DO YOU NEED? UH, ANYTHING WE CAN USE, LETTERS, PHOTOS, DOCUMENTS. HEY, WHAT IF HE COMES BACK WHILE YOU'RE IN THERE? WE'LL SIGNAL YOU TO LET YOU KNOW THAT HE'S COMING. WITH WHAT, GENIUS? BIRD NOISES? KEEP YOUR PHONE ON VIBRATE, ALL RIGHT?
