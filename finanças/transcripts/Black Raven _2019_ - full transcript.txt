In 1921, the outcome of a four-year war that Russia had waged against the Ukrainian People's Republic was decided in favor of the invaders. However, the armed struggle continued for years almost in all parts of Ukraine. The Cold Yar rebels maintained particularly desperate resistance to the Russian forces. Their black battle banner carried the words Free Ukraine or death! THE COLD YAR DOMAIN. PASSAGE FOR CHEKA OFFICIALS STRICTLY PROHIBITED! BLACK RAVEN Based on a novel by Vasyl Shkliar Shoe shine! Come get your shoes shine! Watch your step. Come get your shoes shine! Give me your hand. Watch out! Made it? -Yeah. It?s fine. We need to find my uncle. Hungry? -No. Let?s go. What?s in these pastries? -Apples. -Apples? Young lady, would you care to buy this necklace? -A young lady? Pamper your woman. -We have no money. That?s alright, I won't ask much. Look, what a beauty! I need to feed my kids Citizens bootleggers, are we going to turn moonshine hideaways in voluntarily? Are these your valuables, or are you reselling at a profit? -Off with the looting! Too smart? Your ID! Show me your ID, I said! Besovksky! Enough with the robbery! What robbery, Chief? Just scared off some black marketeers. I?ve taken a note of you, traitor of the revolution. Get ready! Cold Yar, is that a town or a village? It?s hell. Who knows how to say "hell" in Chinese? Off with the laughter! Dress! There you are. And I?m running like a fool around the fair. Why are you standing? Come on. This is Uncle Mitrofan. Hello. This is my Tina. Come on. Right! March! Finally. I thought I won't see you. Meanwhile, new trains, full of the red invaders, were unloading at Cold Yar. The Chekists called it a boiling cauldron of yellow-blue fire. They were unable to extinguish it with their numerous troops. The insurgent detachments numbered over fifteen thousand sabers. They controlled the territory on both sides of the Dnieper. In order to behead the rebel units, a special operation was developed at the Central Political Headquarters to capture the Cold Yar chieftains by deceit and insidiousness. The operation was cynically called Testament, just like Taras Shevchenko?s poem. Chief of Staff Ptitsin? Affirmative! -Plenipotentiary regional GPU representative. Arrived with the 92nd Battalion. -Efim Georgievich? We were waiting for you, but thought you?d be coming later. We wanted to greet you with an orchestra. Not a fan of ceremonies. That's fine. Let's do it the simple way. What?s that? -Some Cognac. Real. From the most noble of cellars. Real it is. Any guess about why I?ve come? Because you can't handle it, Ptitsin. -I disagree. I personally assume the lead in the fight against banditry. Try to be useful to the cause. Have them wash it here with carbolic acid. Any ideas about work? I was thinking of a sugar mill. You?re there, right? Right. It?s better in the town. Quieter. Sorry for such a feast. There is what there is. Thank God, the earth still feeds. And it?s all ours. That?s okay. These are hard times. Well, let's drink to the newlyweds. What? The wine?s no good? Sorry, our food?s simple, nothing exquisite. Dad, pour another one. Let's drink to your future grandson. We still don't know who it?ll be exactly. Where should I make the bed for you, children? In the house or in the hut? In the hut, Dad. I don?t smoke, so I don?t need these Bolshevik newspapers. In a week, I use about a newspaper and a half for smokes. Do they say anything about the hunger? They do. About the one in the Volga region. Right. And over here, you might as well bite the dust. What can we do? The only thing left is patience. Perhaps uncle Mitrofan is right. The town is quieter. I could work in a hospital, and you at a factory. At a factory, they will ask for my ID. We?ll figure something out. Until then, stay with your father. Earth feeds. It?s the best way out, I guess. Right. To sit tight and blend in. You wanted land? There goes your land. You wanted Ukraine? There goes the Ukrainian way for you. You sang a different tune not so long ago. He who fears lives longer. Damn. Help! Did I do well? -You did. Stay put. That?s my daughter-in-law. Lift him up. I'll be right back. Now put him back down. It?s a perforated wound. Hang on there. -The bones are intact. Good enough. Ivan? Ivan... Lift him up again. Do you recognize me? I do. Put him back down. -You did. The boys call me the Werewolf. We served together. Served. Fought. And fought well. Lift him up again. -Wish we had more people like you. Right, Kuzma? This is my younger brother, Kuzma. We fought, we fought, and then we stopped. Hey, let's go have a talk. Let's go. So, did I have to kick them out? Do as you want, just don't make me part of it. I brought you your children and off I went, I saw nothing, heard nothing. Okay? Okay. -Then it?s okay, if it?s okay. Right, it's always warmer under the skirt. Let others fight in the forest. -Enough of that war. I want to live some human life. Under the Chekist?s boot? Don?t make me laugh. Well, some manage to live a sweet little life that way. What?s up? -Brother... He needs a doctor. What doctor? We?ll take him to Motryn. Yavdokha will quickly put him back on his feet. Uncle Yakiv, will you give us your cart? You?re most welcome. Building an independent Ukraine in the forest? Meantime, Petliura?s over there. Who will bring this Ukraine together? Any thoughts? -Petliura has screwed up already. So let him think about it. We?ve got to fight. If you don't know how to win, don't start a war. They used to say. Gee up! Go! Unload faster. Take this one immediately to the hospital. The bandits do everything with excitement. And you, Ptitsin, have none of that. They?re quite some fighters. Bring the captive to me for questioning. -Go! What are you doing here in broad daylight? I told you to come only at night. I come here as if this were a holy water source. Shall we finally get married? Hanna? Why have you come? -Kuzma was hurt. Go down to the cellar, fast! So, what do you say, Hanna? -Who?s that with you? Yakiv, the forester's son. Don't be afraid, he?s one of us. As long as he?s both blind and mute. Okay. Lay him here. -Yeah. Hang on, Kuzma, just hang on. Almost there. What happened to him? -Wounded. He?ll live. I?ll take care of him. But you, guys, will have trouble with him. You. Go around the other side of the house, just in case. Stand up! Three "St. Georges". Are these yours? My son?s. Where is he? He?s no longer fighting, for quite some time already. He?s been living with us since February 1917. Three "St. Georges", and he doesn?t want to fight? So, I take off? Thanks anyway. You know this place isn?t... -I know. Don't overdo the goodbyes. You?ll see each other soon. The war loves you both. It?s not mutual. No one cares what you think. Don't listen to her. She?d just blurt out whatever. I say what I know. How do you know? -I see it, I guess. Where?s he now? Seeing his relatives, will be back tomorrow. Okay. We won?t annoy you. You will come with us. Come. Let's go. Tell your husband if he wants to see his father, to come see us tomorrow. Stand still! Where are you heading? Stand still! Our hero has come. Chernous is here. -Let him come in. Where is my father? -Where he belongs. I want to see him. What else? Let him see his father. Has there ever been an invader anywhere in the world who?d come to a foreign land to do good? There is nothing more insidious than a gift from the enemy?s hands. The more caressing the devil?s grace is, the craftier is the trap he prepares. But what a difficult task it is not to believe promises when they sound exactly like what you want to hear. Don't think of me, son. You need to live. Do you hear me? Think about the baby. I have already lived my share. So? Have you seen your father? Go upstairs! Go. Go. Your tea. What about sugar? There isn?t any. What did he say? How is it possible to understand this man? I'll be honest. Our task is to eradicate banditry in these forests. We really need your help. Let my dad go. Then we?ll talk. Let's do it this way: you have time until nine AM to make up your mind. If you help us, you won?t regret. And if it doesn?t work out? It will. Of course, if you don?t wish to become our enemy. His heart was weak, Chief. You ruined everything! Get lost! What? It's Yakov Chernous... What about Yakov Chernous? He's dead. It ended up in a bad way. It's your... Besovsky overdid it. Overdid. What shall we do? Apologize. Open the gate! Why didn?t you tell us your father had a weak heart? Such consequences were not in our plans. Whoever did this will be punished. It?s all your stubbornness. I advise you not to make such mistakes anymore. A young family doesn?t need it. Think about the future. I'll be waiting for you at my office. Only an old black raven saw him that night. The bird was already 270 years old, but he wasn't tired of contemplating human actions and tried to judge them with reason. Although the raven was already deaf and blind, he could still see through the night a human heart light up with revenge. The raven hears very well this man vowing to fight the intruders to the last breath. Because the battle losses are always inferior to those the man experiences if he is obedient as a slave. I am the Chieftain. Larion Zavhorodniy. And who are you? That?s Ivan Chornovus, son of Yakiv, the forester. I know him well. Or I thought I knew him well. He used to be a good Cossack, but that?s all gone now. Zaliznyak, what?d you say? Not the first one sent here by the Cheka. Derkach, what about you? Did you check his pockets? Here. "Personal attendance is requested for the establishment of all the circumstances of the case. Yakov Chernous. Signed: plenipotentiary Evdokimov." That?s an easy one. Skin him as a goat, and send the skin back to the Chekists. If he were a Chekist, he wouldn?t have come here with this piece of paper. What should I do with you? A bit too quiet, is it? They?re celebrating Gupal's birthday. And this chief of theirs, Zavhorodniy, is he there too? He is. Everyone?s there. Back! Squad, take up defense! Action! Kill the Petliura gang! Down on your knees! We take no prisoners. Wait! Don't kill. Look, I'm ready to eat earth. And is it yours? Why would we need you? Don't you need your own man at the Cheka? For the comrades, I'll come up with something to explain. But these need to be eliminated. Then they?re all yours. I'm not from cavalry, I don?t handle the sword. Hit them with the butt, like rabbits. Lord, Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy... Give me a gun. C'mon! Why waste a bullet? -Quickly! A gun! There. (speaks Chinese) I'm fighting for whoever feeds me. Bitch. Take it. Ivan, you didn?t let us down. Here?s a gift for you. Don?t know his name, though. Wanna be named Moodey? Just be good to your rider. In whose detachment will you be? In mine. -And where is it? I'll be with him. Then I'm with my brother. I'm fighting. We haven't had such a haidamak yet. I'm fighting for whoever feeds me. Will you tell him what?s written on our banner? Let's go. Well, what shall we call you, Chieftain? Black Raven. So be it. Then fly, don't crawl. Let's fly, then! Now it?s more Christian this way. Otherwise it?s like that grave without a cross. What kind of soldier have you gotten yourself! He chose me. Some fight for freedom, others for equality. Everyone?s at war, and you, Mitrofan, keep digging. We are fighting for you. Did I ask you to? They will strangle you all like chickens. Let's drink to that. The Chinese doesn?t drink. Pour one for my father. He doesn't drink, but he eats well. Eat. No need in that light. I don?t care if it?s day or night. How do you know I brought you light? I feel the warm air. And you should go upstairs. It?s better for you. Expecting Ivan?s son? And how do you?? I can see. There's something I can see, and something I can?t. And what is Ivan's fate? What about it? I can see a bird near him. Looks like he?ll be like a bird. You must be hungry. Give me a moment. Aunt Yavdoha, they say you can do anything. What is it, Ivan? Take my fear and grief away. What for? I'm starting a new war. Why have you brought a woman with you? She knows languages. I thought we?d be interrogating some local Jews. Like they don?t speak our speak. You?ll be held responsible for breaking the discipline. Forty bandit collaborators in a single village. Yeah. Even the local Jews would make them boots and clothes. Ptitsin, where were you looking? Amnesty leaflets must be on every lightpost. Let everyone see -Kalyhirka is in our hands now. Will do. And one more thing. I heard, Ptitsin, there is Ukie blood in your veins. There is some. So, wake up that Uke in you. I want you to understand what air the locals breathe. Here and there in the villages, was the sound of shooting, horrified screams, women howling and dogs barking. The sky was ablaze from burning fires. From a distance, it was clear where Moscow?s punitive squadrons were at work. They were taking people?s last crumbs. They called it "working with the local population." So, bitch, where are we gonna put that seal on you? Maybe right in the forehead? Get this shit out of here. I'm not with him, I'm not with him. He?s hauling me everywhere by force. Hold it, guys. What?s your name? I am Zilla Boruch. I have a barber shop in Kamenetz. You can ask anyone, everyone knows me there. And you, too, come for a haircut, your hair?s all too long. Guys, I'm one of you. Let him speak. I'm a Uke too. My grandfather's surname was Ptakh. Do you think I like what's going on here? From Moscow, from Moscow they are sending sheer beasts. They will drown everything in blood. How many prisoners were taken in Mokra Kalyn?vka? A lot. A lot. The war?s a mean thing. There is only one way for you. Amnesty. What about after that amnesty? Will they let us live freely? Sure. Wanna return to your wife and children? You will. Wanna work on your land? You will. Otherwise, men, you will be guilty of the death of your wives and children. Think well. Amnesty. Why did we let him go? Why not just slash his throat? It?s not for you to teach me. I?ve been in the woods longer than you. Have you thought about our women kept as hostages? And where is yours? My father was murdered by the Chekists. Just so you know. "Citizens of the Cold Yar district, lost and deceived, you are given a chance to return to peaceful work. Those who surrender voluntarily..." Stay there. We?ll talk in the camp. We seized half a hundred rifles, fifteen hand grenades, and the police cashbox. We are quits. -We?d be quits if they set our relatives free. I see what you are getting at. Whoever wants amnesty, I will not hold here. Then I?ve had enough of this war. I?d say, go. Fear not, I will not shoot you in the back. Will you let him go? I don't need this in the camp. It?s worse than typhoid. I?ve come for a haircut. Better this way? We took the police cashbox, weapons, ammo. The boys took everything to Motryn. And I dashed right here to you. Well, hello, brunette. Waiting for me? And you? Coming for a flirt or to do the work? Who?s this? -Bartholomew. They say he?s protecting the Haidamaks? treasures. Don?t know about the treasures, but he knows all the monastery dungeons. Your salvation is underground. So that the world won?t see you. Underground, under Motryn. No one will find you here. Yavdokha was right. You will be like a bird. It's time. It?s daylight, go hide underground. Take cover. No reason to hang out here. Salvation is underground. I live in a hole, and so will the baby. God blessed you and Ivan with the baby. And what should I do with this? You didn?t dare to have a child. I can't. What are you looking at? You?ve got Ivan. And no one was there to protect me. Free to go. Yakiv Stetsenko. Semenovych is my patronymic. Free to go. Derkach Ivan Tymofiyovych. Ivan Tymofiyovych. For chieftains we have a special procedure. Stay calm, comrades, stay calm. Keep coming. Bondarenko, Yuri. Free to go. Have a smoke. Don't be shy. Check these out. Papers. Some of them are real. They?ll believe you. For you, this is the only opportunity to justify the confidence of the Soviet authorities. Immediately after the amnesty of the Cold Yar residents, the Reds moved on to the Motryn Monastery. To remove the monastery?s bells, to destroy, once and for all, the main alert system of this accursed Cold Yar Republic, against which they had to fight longer and harder than against the Poles, Germans, and Admiral Wrangel. He escaped, damn it! Move on! Well, citizens nuns, have you finished your liturgy? Now, tell us where the bandits hide the loot. So? All right. Who?s in charge here? One moment. Comrades women, we have come only for the property of the Soviet authorities, which was stolen by the bandits. The monastery is under no threat. By Jesus. Stand still! Remove the gun. Rebel bitch. A woman but all the same. You?d be giving birth, won?t you? -From you or what? -Could be. Quiet, quiet, quiet. Can?t wait to get to the Kingdom come? You?ll have time to do it. You haven?t gotten much longer to trot this land. What? -What you heard. Take her away. Why are you standing still? Everyone to the yard! Come on! Move! Move! Move! Hello. Please. The others, search everything here! Fast! Come on, let?s go. Faster, faster, faster! Move. Here. Good, good. Hurry up there! Hurry up! There?s the cashbox. And these were helping the wounded bandits. Like that. You?ll come with me. Finish the wounded. What should I do with the nuns? Don't even think about it. Well, what was I telling you, brother? Don't rush to live. Witch. One of them has been here already, the UNR emissary. Crack his asshole. Was feeding us fairytales that soon planes would come loop the loops in the sky signaling the start of the uprising. And now it?s only GPU that loops nooses here. Ours are all gone, hurry up. We?ll catch up. Come on. Stop. Ivan, did you see her dead? Don't burry her too soon. Sit down. Sit down. Tell me, bitch, how did it happen so that I mentioned the Motryn Monastery to you, and the Reds immediately came to take it over? How so? Cut. Come on, cut. If you?ve got enough strength. Listen. They?ll catch you all! Troops arrive to the station every day. What are you fighting for? They don't care. And I, for your sake, walk under the threat of death every day. Are we so bad together? Captain Zaviriukha. Do you trust him? -I fought with him in the Kostia Blakytnyi?s Division. Okay, we?ll see. Now or never. The time for the general uprising has come. The earth itself is begging us to unite against the red plague. Here are the orders of the commander of the Black Sea Insurgent Group. You must clearly identify who will operate in which area. In the meantime, stop any small sorties. Sitting in the woods hiding? Waiting for what? Otherwise you lose a great cause. How many sabers can you put up in case the uprising starts? If the fire ignites, thousands will come out. But really, what?s the wait for? Thirty thousand will come out from across the Zbruch river. Meantime, we all need to come together in a single fist. That?s why we call on the chieftain council in Zvenyhorka. That?s right where the Chekists roost. Why don't you gather here? Moscow cigarettes? What, did I have to come to you in a uniform holding a banner? I smoke whatever cigarettes they?ve got here. If necessary, take more time to consult. But give me the answer in half an hour. I'm waiting at the forest?s edge. Raven, what?s your croaking about? Forgot why Petliura?s abroad? I don?t trust such people. There are no other leaders in Ukraine. If you don?t trust them yourself, it?s up to you. And we?ve got one last chance. I support the uprising. I will not go to the council. Nothing destroys a man like hopelessness. The Ukrainian army, which the Cold Yar fighters were on the lookout for, had crossed the Zbruch where Poles, our former allies, threw everyone into camps. If the insurgents knew the truth about the army, the government, the dismay of the leaders, they could have turned things around differently. But they lacked a hetman who?d suppress the anarchy and gather everyone together in one fist. Come in. Quietly. Wait here. Where are the others? -One moment. Larion Zavhorodniy? You are under arrest. Where are you going? It's time. The guys already look at me with a side glance. I told you to stay here. And you?re back to your thing. I can't do it anymore. Open your eyes! All the chieftains were arrested. Who?s the traitor? You or me? And who didn't show up for the council? -That's none of your business. The Cheka took your Raven?s wife. Here's the milk. Why do you refuse to eat? You are pregnant. Do you care? Do you think we are monsters or something? Then why am I here? Because your husband is a traitor. We shouldn?t?ve gone there. We were betrayed. -That's what I'm talking about. How come? The chieftains were all caught and you were the only one to get out? I said right away it was a stupid idea. And yet you let them go there? You sold off the chieftains. Exchanged them for your wife. What do you know about my wife? You started disappearing from the compound. -Don't lay the blame in someone else. You let the chieftains down and you want to do this to others? And why are you, little nothing, opening your mouth? Forgot it?s the chieftain in front of you? He is no longer our chieftain. I don't trust him. Neither do the guys. What about you, brother? Gee-ho! Gee-ho! The old raven saw the ranks of the Cold Yar fighters get thinner. Many were killed. Some went for the amnesty. Others were captured. Someone managed to sneak abroad. And some, out of despair, went on to collaborate with the enemy. In the woods, only the fiercest remained, the most devoted, those true to their motto Freedom of Ukraine or death! to the end. Although there was no more hope of a general uprising or help from overseas, there was not the slightest hope of victory, yet the Black Raven told himself that no catastrophe would ruin the goal. Freedom takes root in their blood, on their graves. And the longer they last in this fight, the greater the hope that their children and grandchildren will pick up their banner. Why are you all wound up? I was doing my job. It wasn?t necessary to sleep with him. It was necessary for the cause. What does the bandit have that I don't have? Carry on working for us, but stay off my eyes. Go away! Would you like to dance? Are you free now? Don't you see? You what? Barehanded? Yes. I was standing by the water, it swam up to me. In China we say, if you can't win, defend yourself. If you want to win, attack. Right. The guys held a council. They want you for our chieftain. Yeah, for some mice, maybe. They think they hid themselves. In hay. But only their heads. The asses are sticking out. We have betrayed our chieftain. No, brother, he betrayed us. You yourself left him. I keep thinking about what Raven said. Really, what do you know about his wife? Nothing. I just said what others were afraid to. And if you don't believe your brother, then go back to Raven. And what got you so unwound? Barely off your mom?s tit and already opening your mouth wide on everyone? Don't yell like that. You?re teasing the dogs. You?ll be gone, and they?ll hang me tomorrow. Please leave before sunrise. Are we not fighting for you? Scum. For whom are you fighting, brother? No matter what you do, they will endure everything. So, for whom? Where are you heading, little chicken? I'm no little chicken, brother. For a long time, I've been trying to be polite with you. Despite the fact that your husband is a bandit. An active chieftain. Do you want to keep your baby? Then all that is required of you is to say a few words at one holiday event. What do I have to say? That you denounce your bandit of a husband. Think about the future. Get up, brother. Get up. I can congratulate you. Zavhorodniy and other chiefs are already on their way to Kyiv. I wrote a report and emphasized your efforts. Then why did they beat me up? To make it look truthful. The Soviet authorities promised to release me. If they promised, they?ll let you go. Let's go! "Arise ye workers from your slumbers Arise ye prisoners of want..." More cheerful, more cheerful. -"For reason in revolt now thunders..." Studying "The International". So far without much success. Should?ve sent these ones to Kyiv as well. I don't get what this whole idea is about. Their singing is bad, and we are short of time. The moral victory over the bandits is important to us. Their singing quality is of little importance. Let them sing. Citizens bandits, let's go again. From the start. Sing. Sing, you, stubborn crum. "Arise ye workers from your slumbers" I don?t get it. Are they singing "The International" in their Uke language? They don?t know otherwise. Okay. Just don't overdo it. We don't need them dead. -That's right. Let's go! "Arise ye workers from your slumbers" -Sharper! Let go of me. Let go. What, Khodia, did you shit yourself? Where?s Kuzma? What am I, my brother's guard? They now behave like masters of the land. They?ve hung everywhere banners for the fifth anniversary of the revolution. And when is the anniversary? The day after tomorrow. At the Sugar Factory club. They want to celebrate. Well, so do we. If you don't know how to win, don't start a war. You told me so yourself. -I did. And if you want to win, attack. Right, Khodia? Eat. Well, that?s it, Khodia. I?ll keep going on my own. The fight was choked, but no matter what, it needed to have a continuation. Leaving the black forest, Raven was thinking about taking revenge for the chieftain council. When there is no hope of victory, there is still a desire for revenge. The desire, which all Cossacks were burning with, it brought most of them to the forest. It was necessary to retaliate to the enemy, remind everyone of themselves, show the boys it was too early to give up. You work at the factory, you should know all the ins and outs. What is on your mind? Uncle, we are preparing for tomorrow's celebration. My soul had a feeling you?d come. You?re the last thing I need now... Are you coming? So that?s why. Hello, comrades. -Hello. Hello. Comrades, I congratulate you all on the fifth anniversary of the Great Revolution! Oh, and here?s the highlight of the show: the repented ones. Tonight, this stage will feature a song and an amateur theater that will show acrobatic stunts. It?s remarkable, comrades, that on the fifth anniversary of the Great Revolution we?re celebrating one more victory. The victory over the Cold Yar gangs! Repent, then sing one verse of the International. Then you return backstage. Put on clean shirts. Don't worry. I'm here. They are well guarded. Ptitsin! -One moment! Brought your woman again? It's a holiday today, isn?t it? -For some it?s a holiday, for others it?s work. Right, I see. Here?s a task along your lines. Guard her. If she gets away, your head rolls. Affirmative. But what for? -You will convoy her yourself. And then you?ll go to see your woman. By the way, did you tell her your previous one was stabbed to death? I forgot. Exit! I?ll be right back. Why are you standing still? Move! I don?t get one thing. What goddamn reason are you here for? Dying is not scary, being hungry is scary. What? -It's not scary to die. Hungry is scary. Will you ever be full, Khodia? You'd better run away from here. Well, goodbye then. Freeze! Don?t move! Don?t be a fool. Or I kill her. Take your rattles away. Keep something for yourself, uncle. Don't worry about me. Today, as a testimony of the triumph of the Great Revolution, comes the reformation of its enemies. Thugs repent for their crimes. They repent for giving up peaceful work for the sake of beastly burrows in the forests. Let them speak. Let the country hear. Get them out of here. It?s remarkable, comrades, that on the fifth anniversary of the revolution we will hear one more... The Petliura bandits will repent for spilling blood on the friendship with the brotherly Russian people. So, Cossacks? -Now it?s the time to repent. Repent and keep repenting. -I'm with everyone, guys. Say your affirmative "Yes!" to the Soviet authorities. Goddamn it. Shoot! To arms! Quiet, everyone! The chieftains will repent! What do we do with them? Damn, we?ll have to let these rats go. Won?t have enough bullets for everyone. Well, let them live. Live, sons of bitches. Remember, you?ll never have a quiet moment on this land. If not us, then our children! Get the hell out of here! Guys, to the windows! These are not much use. To die more peacefully. Peaceful or not, I'll take some of them with me. Quiet! Go, go. It's the end. Little bitch. Go, go. Go. There. It's from Khodia. Damn. Will they ever run out of them? One day they will. Why are you grinning? On February 9, 1923, the captured Cold Yar chieftains started an uprising in the Lukyanivska prison. They seized weapons in the guard chamber and for four hours, in the middle of Kyiv?s city blocs, were fighting with the enemy, all safeguarding the last bullet for themselves. The Black Raven assembled a new squadron from the surviving fighters and carried on the battle till, at least, 1925. THE END
