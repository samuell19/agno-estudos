- Carol? Carol? - Michael? What the hell are you doing here? You thought I was gonna let you do this on your own, did you? (Chuckles) Did you? Is that what you thought? Go get the bags. Hold on, have you spoken to Keenan? Look, forget about Keenan. It's just us now, love. - It's just us. - Do you mean it? Of course I mean it. I mean it. (Sighs) Watch yourself. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. (Moans) (Exhales) Christ. You've got great timing (!) You're the one that's early! (Moans) - My love. - What the fuck is that? Don't worry, I'll get rid of it down south. Oh, yeah. Like that'll be of use in the hospital (!) Weapon sighted. Bandit's heading south. (Car rattles) (Vehicle clunking) Christ! Has this thing got square wheels or what? Don't fly anywhere, love. Just you hold onto the wee fella. I don't want him bouncing out! Oh, it's good to see you. You know I didn't wanna do this without you. (Brakes squeal) What? What is it? Shit. You can lose them in the woods. Carol, I'm not leaving you. - Just go. Just go, please! - I'm not leaving you with them fuckers. I know, Michael, but if you stay, we don't stand a chance, ok? They're not after me. Go on, please, Michael! Go! (Groans) Go! Go! Go! (Groans) British army! O'Hara, do not move! (Panting) (Three gunshots) (Gunfire) Major fucking propaganda victory for the Republicans, tempest. What the hell happened? Intel reported a weapon in the car. Sir, sib's at the gate. - Shall I let them in? - No. You don't expect us to believe that? - The bandit had six kills. - Seven. - Sir? - Ryan didn't make it. But your bandit did. Fuck knows where he is. Go on. British army! O'Hara, do not move! We were tipped off about his location but When we moved in, we found the vehicle abandoned. (Groans) (Three gunshots) I thought I was facing an imminent threat, sir. You thought you were going to be shot? That was my reading of the situation. I was about to be shot. By a pregnant woman in labour? Sir, sib are-fuck off! Well, that's that, then. Glad we sorted that out. This shitshow doesn't end With us hoicking snowy here out in a chopper. We don't have that authority. No you don't but I do. Tempest, would you wait outside? (Helicopter blades whirring) Can I have the room? - This room? - Get out. Soldiers are here in support of the civil power. They have no legal authority beyond that of an ordinary civilian. (Inhales) Any actions they take must be in accordance with the laws of the United Kingdom And are, in fact, punishable by those laws. I'm aware of the yellow card, sir. Good... Because you are about to be prosecuted for murder. There are... two ways out of this. One, we open that door. We let sib in to rip you apart. Your commanding officers, they'll try and protect you but you'll cease to be a soldier. You'll spend the next three years sharpening pencils for a bunch of lawyers and then you'll probably go to prison. Or... You come and work for me. I'm putting together a detachment. I could use a dead shot like you. And what about all this? I'll make it go away. You make it sound easy, sir. I assure you it'll be anything but easy... But you'll continue to serve your country and do what you do best. Where do I report, sir? It's not really... That sort of thing. Do you have somewhere you can stay off grid? Somewhere that isn't the barracks? I do. Good. Good. I'll see you in London. (Exhales) (Sighs) (Three gunshots echo) (Breathes deeply) Carol's voice: Michael, I'm right here, darling. I'm right here. Look. It's ok, Michael. Look, you had to go. (Gunshot) (Seagulls cry) (Sombre music) 'shops and offices were closed as hundreds of people lined the route of the funeral. In the church of the sacred heart, the circumstances of Carol's shooting were referred to by father Joe McVeigh as a day of tragedy that had touched everyone-' (radio off) We're so sorry for your loss. Look... I'm not a doctor. I'm a vet. Cats and dogs. You'll need someone to check those wounds for you. - Thank you. - Michael? There is another way, you know? There was. Not any more. Orla mcshawn, colm mcneish. (Children chatter) What the hell are you playing at turning up here like this? I thought you were dead. I have business with the man that killed Carol. (Children chatter) Brits flew him to London. I need you to get me there. I'm sorry but you wanted out, Michael. - I'll do whatever it takes. - You're not gonna like what it takes. But I could use a man they think is dead. I'm taking twomey. Peadar twomey's got problems. Not with me he hasn't. If we're to do this... There'll be no more talk of getting out until I say so, understood? I need you to say it. Understood. And, Michael? I'm gonna need that ring. Just give me the name of that soldier. Sheila went back with her mother. Didn't like it... Stuck all the way out here. Still... I have the dog, I suppose. Best dog I've ever had. I heard about Carol. Fucking bastards. I'm heading over the water. I want you to come. Keenan's putting us with a unit. I can't. The dog would miss me too much. You know, he'd be lost without me. I'm going after the soldier that killed Carol. I need your help. The papers are coming tonight. We leave tomorrow.
