Time to get up, dad! You'll be late. Yes. Morning. Good morning. You're here so early. Actually, today's the last day for our bakery. Oh, I see. But I'm glad I managed to keep my promise, to the end. Thank you for everything. Happy birthday. Thank you. Yuji? Where's my new toothbrush? I told you yesterday. The miracle... That unfolded during the rainy season that year, started in this forest. The miracle only lasted 6 weeks... Maybe, it was nothing more... Than an illusion we glimpsed beyond the mists. But there's no question... That we saw my mother. Be with you It's been a year now, since mio died. I wonder if takumi and yuji are really all right. You see how takumiis... She never should have gone through with having yuji. It was such a difficult birth. She was just fine before she had yuji. To my little yuji - mommy Where do all the people go when they die? They're on the archive star. Isn't that what mommy wrote in her book? Is mommy really on the archive star, too? That's what I think. Mommy would never lie. That means mommy's coming back for the rainy season, right? Isn't she? Yeah... All right, let's eat. Sorry, daddy messed up again. That's ok, I can eat it. Thanks for the food. Thanks. I'm going first, daddy. Off you go. Daddy, don't be late. I won't. I'm off. I'm off. Alo. Send this, ok? This order... It'll be much more efficient in this order. Thanks. Sure. And... Thank you. Sure. And also... I think that's out of season. It's a winter suit... Oh, sorry. 1lt's likely rain will be heavy at times. Given the fast-moving front, it seems rainy season has finally arrived. The rainy season... Do you like rain? Yes, well... I see... It's the festival this weekend. Does yuji want you to take him? I can take him if you like... Ailo-San. No, um... This is ready. Thank you. Going to the festival? Yes! Aren't you going to the festival? Um, my daddy... Doesn't like to be around lots of people. Oh, I see. You heard the chime. What's that? It's upside down. It'll make it rain! It's aio's fault! I think it's sweet. Time to start our lesson. Maths is next. Doctor... Why can't daddy do things? Is he sick? Yeah, that's it. Let's say your daddy was a car. It's like his gasoline gets stuck. It's not that he's sick in his head or in his heart. Do you understand? But your daddy isn't unhappy. Why not? Because he has you. Yuji. I'm sorry to be late, doctor. Don't worry, take your time. I feel bad for yuji. Why? With me for a father... That's not true at all. I'm impressed that you've overcome local doubts, and turned out to be such a wonderful father. Hardly. I wish I could do things for him... Like a normal parent. It's over a year now, since mio-San's death. Recently, I remember... Less and less about mio. I only feel her when I watch her on video or look at her photograph. But mio's coming back. Soon... In the rainy season? Yes. With her last words she promised she'd be back in the rainy season? She wrote it in yuji's book, too. Do you believe that? Yuji believes it. I see... Is it impossible? As I thought... Well, scientifically, after all, I am a doctor. Yes, it's as I thought... - Alo. - Yes? Do you want mio-San to come back, too? Yes. Because I failed miserably to make her happy... Is that what you think? With my condition, I was only a burden. From beginning to end. Just once, I wish she'd felt happy that she'd shared my life. So if she comes back, I want to make her feel that way. Take a trip on a train somewhere, like a normal couple... I see... Doctor, you don't ask about my condition, even though, you're a doctor. How are you feeling? The same. Lousy, huh? That's not true. It tastes lousy. I'm sorry, yuji. It's ok, I can eat it. I'm all done. Hey, yuji. How'd you like to go to the festival on Saturday? Remember how you went with mommy before? You said you had a great time. But... Will you be ok, daddy? I'll be fine, you want to go, right? Yeah! Aio! Aya-chan. Let's go look over there. Yuji! Yuji! Yuji! Daddy, I want to try this one. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Yuji! Daddy. Yuji... I'm sorry. So sorry. Daddy, you're not going to go away... Are you? No, I won't go away, I promise. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, yuji. Hey, daddy. It's my fault mommy died, right? Isn't that true? Yuji, why would you say that... Because, I heard our relatives say it... That's not right. It's not your fault. Besides, daddy's never going away. Ok. I want to see mommy. What are you looking for? A four-leaf clover. Mommy wants to make a wish. What kind of wish? For mommy to get all better. Thank you. Mio. Are you ok? I'm fine. It's really pouring. Wa-ter. Ter? Ter-mite. What's that? Yuji. Be careful. I'm ok. What are you looking for? A big secret. I promised mommy. Promised mommy? But I can't find it anymore. Better Mark it. Yeah... Mommy. Mio. Mommy! Mio... Is it really you, mio? Mio? Is that my name? Mommy. Mommy? Who are... you? Don't you remember, mio? You're... my wife... And yuji's mother. I'm... a wife. And mother? See, look. It's me... Mommy, what was it like on archive star? Oh, um, mio. You'll catch cold, you should change. Your things are all still there. Still there? Right. Hurry up and change. Yuji, come with me. Just come, come. Listen, yuji. It's our little secret that mommy's back, ok? Why? They don't know about the archive star, so they'll think she's a ghost. Right. And mommy doesn't seem to remember anything. Not about daddy, or about you. Or that she died, once. Why? Maybe that's how it is when you come from the archive star. Why is it like that? How should I know! I'm sorry. Sorry. She doesn't remember me. No. I see. She can start getting to like us... Like you and daddy, too... May I ask a question? Please. Did I used to live here? With you? Yes. Why is this house such a mess? Was I such a slob? Of course not. You're very neat. But you were... In bed, sick... Yeah. I see. But still... What a mess. You're right. What was I doing in those woods? We were on a walk... The three of us were. - A walk? - A walk. Then, you felt a little strange. And you were resting. You were resting. Then it seems... You lost your memory. It seems. Yeah, it seems. I see. I see. You're a cute boy. Yuji? I'm... mio? Your wife... And yuji's mother. I see. Breakfast's ready. Wow! Yeah? You, first, yuji. Morning. Morning. Morning. Morning. Daddy! Look at this perfect fried egg. It's been a long time! You're right. Something's strange. Yeah? Oh, this? Not your clothes. You two. - That's not true. - That's not true. I'm off. Off you go. Mio. I think you'd better not leave the house. Wouldn't want you to get sick again. I'm off, then. Your shoelace. Off you go... Takumi-San. Yeah, I'm off. Morning. You won't believe it, it's amazing, yesterday... What? Oh... a secret. You're just making it up. No, I'm not, but it's a secret! I'm jealous, you have a secret. It's good to have secrets. Good morning. Good morning. Something good happen? Yes. What? It's a secret. Oh, I see. This is better. Yummy. Yeah? It's delicious. Was I a good cook? You sure were. Ok, boots. Was this me? That's right. Then, who's this? Taku-San. Then I'm pink... What a darling... He's your child. Yes, I gave birth to him. We were husband and wife, right? That's right. I can sort of understand that you two are my family... And I think it's true. But... I'm sorry, I still can't remember anything. Take your time, take your time. Tell me about us. About us? How did we meet? How did we fall in love? How did we come together? We met in the spring, as juniors in high school. We were both juniors? That's right. We were in the same class for 2 years. By chance, you sat next to me both years. I fell for you first... You were cheerful and cute, and you got great grades. A model student. But you were moody and it seemed to me that you were always angry about something. I liked that about you. Yeah, I liked that. Didn't I like you back? I think... my love was unrequited. Unrequited? Yeah. I was an oddball. I had no interests other than track and field and I was never one for hanging out. I was kind of aloof... And always alone. I see... were you a fast runner? Yeah, I held the prefectural record. But at the track meet during our first year in high school... I got so mad, after that, I did nothing but train like crazy every day. I was obsessed with running faster and just got weirder. I see. I doubt you could have liked me then. Not that you disliked me, or had feelings for someone else. You didn't... Seem to be interested in romance. But... That's what I liked about you. I was so happy, just to be able to sit next to you. But we never said more than, morning. Morning fo each other, before graduation. I got an athletic scholarship to a local college and you were going off to school in Tokyo. Can I sign it, too? Sign it. Oh, sure. Thank you, I felt so comfortable being next to you. Aio takumi here. Thank you. Sure. And then you took off for Tokyo. Wait a minute. When did we start falling in love? Can you just be patient and listen a little longer? That first summer vacation, I happened to hear you were back home. Hello? Still not yet? It's coming up real soon. Hello? My name is alo. I'm aio, do you remember me? Yes, um, I'm sorry to call out of the blue. Remember when I signed your yearbook on graduation day, I never took my pen back. Could I have it back? Of course, it was just an excuse. I didn't care about that pen. It's just that, I just had to... See you again. Just one more time. Alo. Here. Thanks. I'm sorry about your precious pen. Oh, no, it's fine. Thanks. It's been a while. How have you been? Fine. Oh, I see. See you. See you. Say... Do you have time for a cup of coffee? I do. I couldn't believe I'd found the courage. But that's how our memorable first date took place, two and a half years after we first met. So then, so then? I couldn't stop talking, like water from a broken dam. I didn't dare stop. Because if I stopped, I was afraid you'd say you were going home. I was so scared, I talked about track, about my favorite music, books I'd just read... Even how I'd always watched you. Alo. It's cold, isn't it? You're welcome, if you want. Ok, then... I'll take you up on that. Can l... see you again? I have to go back to the dorm. But... I'll write you. That's how it all started. You and me. I want to get used to you gradually, the way I did back then. I want to fall in love all over again. Sure... thank you. Mommy, I'm done, dry me. Yuji, you can dry yourself off. Ok, arms up. Um. Yes? You're looking sharp these days. Yes. Did you meet someone special? Yes. I wish you could eat neatly without spilling. Doesn't daddy always say the same thing? You, too, takumi-San. Hey, aya. You can't tell anyone. You have to promise. One, two and... Again. Ok, one, two and... Yuji, don't forget your umbrella. Sure. Yuji's birthday Mio, do you think it's a boy or a girl? An adorable boy. How can you tell? A secret. Squeaky clean... I look... so happy. Do you believe me? Of course you don't. Well, what to say... You don't seem like someone who'd tell a lie, but then, I was also at her funeral. You don't have to believe me. I'm sorry, forget I told you. I'm at a loss. I'm sorry. But... Assuming you're telling the truth, if mio has returned in this rainy season, she must disappear again when it is over. Yes. Is that what will happen? Probably... Because mio would never lie. Which means sad times ahead... For both yuji... And youl... The rainy season was over. Time to go home. Yuji. Yes. Why are all the sunshine dolls in our house upside down? You won't go away, will you, mommy? Of course not, how foolish. Say, what's this key for? A time capsule. You and I buried it together, without telling daddy. A time capsule? But I can't remember where we buried it. I see. Let's hope we can find it. Um... sparrow. Row, row-your-boat. Boat? Boat-yard. Yard, yard, yard-bird. Bird, bird-cage. It's not here. Not here. If they don't... Even if I don't get my memory back, it's ok. I love you and yuji, too. As long as I can stay with you, it's all right. If I can be your wife... Mio? What? Can I kiss you? No? What's wrong? Didn't you like it? I just feel... I'm not sure. Like it was my first kiss. You're right. Please check this. Kaneko-San, this is ready, too. The front is moving swiftly, which may prolong this rainy season considerably... Excellent. You're happy about that? Yes, I'm thrilled. Found it! To my little yuji - mommy The archive star? Mommy! I found the time capsule! Look! Wow, so this is it. Shall we open it? Daddy! Takumi-San! What's wrong, takumi-San! Are you ok? I'm sorry. This happens, sometimes... Why didn't you tell me? I didn't want you to worry. Silly. I'm sorry. Can I join you? You're welcome. Ok, then, I'll take you up on that. Tell me what happens next. After that date... Actually, we never had a second date. We broke up once. What happened to us? Because of my condition. Physically, I'd pushed myself too hard in high school, and my body just started to go haywire. In my sophomore year of college, everything fell apart, with a crashing bang. Countless medical exams ultimately concluded that my brain was randomly secreting the chemicals, that control most motor functions and reflexes. In any case, you really can't run... I was forbidden to run. Crowds and vehicles were also put off limits. I gave up on everything and even dropped out of college. Let's take it slowly. You need to take it slowly and learn to live with your condition. Don't worry. It's not necessarily a misfortune. But you... Wouldn't tell me about it? I didn't know how... My condition was hard to define. I couldn't even manage half of what most people could. My future looked bleak. I couldn't ask you to join me in a life like that. That's why... I thought, I'd just quietly disappear... Welcome. Alo. Sorry to show up like this. Am I a nuisance? I heard you quit college... I've got lots of plans... So I can't see you anymore. Why not? Maybe I'll run into you again, at a high school reunion. We might both be married... I hope you'll be happy, enokida-San. But I... See you. What I did was terrible. But I kept telling myself, it was for the best. After a single date and 47 love letters, our romance was about to end. But I still wanted to see you. It was selfish, but I wanted to see you again. Traveling to Tokyo alone, was almost impossible for me by then... But I just couldn't stand it. I just had to see you. Mio. Thanks for this. It really helped. Of course I'm not right for mio... That's what I told myself. I wasn't good enough for you. After that, I left you alone. And you left me alone, too. I'm sure mio feels the same way, she wants to forget about me. That's what I thought. But then... One day, out of the blue, you called. You didn't write, you called. Hello? Hello, aio... Can I come see you? What's that look? Because... Don't look at me like that. I'm right for you. That's not true, how foolish. It's fine... We're just fine. Your conviction overwhelmed me, and I agreed. But you sounded... Almost like you were trying to convince yourself. Eventually, we got married and we settled here, close to Dr. noguchi. And then... yuji was born? That's right. And we lived happily after that? Yeah. And we'll live happily ever after, too? I feel so calm. Holding me. Holding me? This is how you always... Slept beside me. I'm off. Off you go. Taku. Don't rush. Take it slow. Aio takumi. Ok, you try it now. Take your time... Not so hard. Try it again. I said, you didn't have to tap it so hard. - I can't do it right. - Don't be like that. C'mon, yuji. Yuji! That's it! You've got it, yuji! Daddy! Good morning. I made this egg. Amazing, yuji. Morning. Morning. Not like this. You've got to shape it, like this. Spread it and tap, tap, tap. Spread it and tap, tap, tap. Now turn it over. Daddy's shoes are so big, look. I hope there are lots of flowers. I know. A garden full of flowers here would be so beautiful. I wish I could see it. Oh, nothing. You take good care of them. Sure. Sunflower. You're working so hard. Yeah. What a big boy. Yeah, daddy? When the rainy season's over, mommy's going back to the archive star, right? I wonder. But what if she's forgotten all about that. But even if she has, I'm sure they'll come to get her. 'Cause, it's always that way in all the stories. I see. We'd better really enjoy the time we have together. I'm sorry I scared you. Mio... -San? Right? Yes. But... I'm sorry. It's really a long story and it'll just confuse you. Will you just listen to me? Please. I'm asking you. Yes, I will. Thank you. I came here to ask you to do something for me, nagase-San. Ask me? Yes. Can I ask you to look after takumi and yuji? I ook after... The other day, aio-San said he'd met someone special. Was that...? But I'll be gone soon. After the rainy season ends. And so, I want to be sure someone looks after takumi and yuji. Takumi needs help with certain things. So I want him... Taken care of. Can I ask you to do that? I'm sorry. I'm not as noble as I thought. I'm worried about them, but I don't want takumi with anyone else. I couldn't stand, just couldn't stand to have him love someone else. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please forget this. It's fine. You don't have to worry. There's no way that he's going to fall in love with me. I don't think he'd love anyone but you. That's aio-San. Thank you. I'm really talking with you, mio-San, right? Yes, takumi's told me about you. It seems that you're always looking out for him. Thank you. Oh, not at all. It's been a while. I'm sorry. I don't remember you at all. How does this look? Happy birthday yuji I just wanted to check. Yes, what is it? Your bakery isn't planning to shut down, is it? Will you be ok? Of course we will, are you nuts? Oh, good. Then I'd like to order some birthday cakes. Let's see... 12 years' worth. Once a year, until my boy turns 18. Wow! Amazing. It's no big deal. It's a birthday cake! That's right, it's yours. Cool! Yuji's birthday is next week... Oh, never mind. I wanted to celebrate it today. Sit down. Sit down. Smile, yuji. Look this way. Hurry. Mio. You sure? I'm a little scared. I'm crazy about you. I'm crazy about you. I love you. I love you. Alo. What's wrong? I have to go home! I just have to go home now. Teacher! I understand, go on. Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! The national weather service has announced the rainy season is over... Aio-San! Summer's here. Mio! Mio! Yuji? You listen to what I say, now. Ok? Mommy has to... Go away now. I have to say good-bye. Yuji. Mio! I'm sorry, mommy. It's my fault you died, isn't it? You're so silly. Did you really believe that? Because... That's not true. Not even one tiny bit true. Don't you believe me? Yuji... You were born because we wanted you so, so badly. Maybe it's the real reason why mommy and daddy met. To make you, yuji. You brought us happiness. You've made me so happy. Understand? Yui, grow up to be a wonderful man, ok? And look after... daddy. Won't you see daddy? I wonder... If he'll make it. He won't make it. He walks so slowly. He goes so slowly. But you know, yuji... There was a time when daddy was an incredibly fast runner. He looked very cool. Mio... I can't find it, I can't. Mio! Daddy! Mio! You made it... I'm glad. Mio. Yes? I'm sorry. I wanted to make you happy. I couldn't... Make you happy. I'm sorry. What are you saying? You and your son are quite a pair. I was so happy. I've always been happy. Since I fell in love with you. You were my happiness. Being with you was all the happiness I wanted. If I could, I would always be by your side. Look after yuji, ok? Love him for me, too. Alo... It's cold. Thank you. I always felt so comfortable being next to you. Found it! Mommy! Found it! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! I see. She arrived with the rain and departed with the rain. She's like a hydrangea. Doctor, do you really believe me? I wonder... But I... Fell in love with mio all over again. I was so happy. I wonder how many people in this world, can say they've known such a wonderful love. To meet, then be drawn back together again. Over and over again... You were both lucky enough to meet your one true soul-mate. June 24th. I found someone I can't help thinking about. All I do is think about him. I wonder if I'm in love. Sophomore, class 3, seat 1, aio takumi. Go! That was clearly a foul. That's unacceptable. But I surprised myself. Why on earth did I do that? I guess I'm in love with him. But he doesn't know how I feel. It's what they call unrequited love. I used my power on the student council I can't even talk to him. But I'm happy just sitting next to him. It's enough to make me kind of... happy. Alo. I want to get to know you. What books are you reading? What kind of music do you like? What are your favorite colors? What kind of girls do you like? Could you fall in love with me? We have to say good-bye and we haven't even started. What'll I do? What am I supposed to do? Sorry. Sign it. Thank you, I felt so comfortable being next to you. Aio takumi If I'd run after you, I could've returned your pen. But I didn't. Because as long as I had it, I could see him again. I could call him to give it back and I could see him again. I'll call him. Just tell him I'll give him his pen back. But I couldn't find the courage. I'm sorry about your precious pen. I'm sure I'll find it. I was so surprised when he called me about it. I get to see him. This pen brings happiness. Here. Oh, thanks. It's been a while. How have you been? Fine. Oh, I see. See you. See you. I'm hopeless. You wanted to see him so badly. I can't believe I'm just going home. Is that really what I want? Say... Do you have time for a cup of coffee? I do. I've read this book 3 times already... You couldn't stop talking, like a dam had broken. I could hardly get a word in. But I was so happy. Because I was next to you. I wish this would last forever. Your hand... Felt so warm. But in the spring, you wrote me a letter. It was just three lines... But, why? Maybe I'll run into you again, at a high school reunion. We might both be married. I hope you'll be happy, enokida-San. But my... See you. But my only happiness is at your side. I just want to be with you forever. That's all. Are we really over? I want to see you. I want to see you so badly, I can't bear it. Aio? Sorry... Aio! Aio! Aio! Takumi! Takumi! Takumi... Mommy! Mio? Morning. I doubt anyone would believe ft. I can hardly believe it myself. As a 20 year-old, I met you as a 29 year-old, fell in love and made love. I leaped into the future, into a rainy season 9 years later. Takumi and I had married and we had a darling boy named yuji. I was happy. I led a happy life. I fell in love with you all over again. But then I learned... That I had really died one year earlier. I will die... at 28. Leaving my beloved takumi and yuji behind I'm going to die... And I'll promise to return in the next rainy season. Alo, takumi. If I never see you again, will I marry someone else and live a different life? Is there a future for me, where I won't die... At 287? But I don't want that. Because I'm in love with you. Because I saw our future together. I want to meet you and be with you... I choose the life in which I give birth to yuji. I want to bring yuji into this world. I don't want it any other way. Hello, aio? Can I come and see you? No matter how briefly, I'm choosing the future with you whom I love. Ajo. Takumi. Yuji. Please wait for me. I want to be with you. What's that look? Because... Don't look at me like that. I'm right for you. That's not true, how foolish. We're fine... We'll be just fine. You and I will always be together. That's just the way it is. The way it is? That's right. You're my one true soul-mate. I love you. Dad. Shall we get started? Sure. You sure curry's ok for your birthday? Sure, I like your curry. Here. - Hey, have you grown again? - You think? Turn around. I am not. You sure? Like a falling flower petal like a dream it's a miracle to have met you loving each other, fighting each other, getting past various obstacles together even if I'm reborn, I want to become a flower beside you How long will it last... This sun right above me? How long can I maintain... Your smiling and crying expressions? If we were to eventually lose everything, let's be more grateful of our encounter the miracle of that day, that time, that place will give birth to a new miracle getting past hard times by believing in each other what you have left me is still in my heart without losing its brightness I'm happy that we came across each other this smile I regained is my overwhelming feeling of "thank you", now I can move forward like a falling flower petal like a dream it's a miracle to have met you what you have left me is a treasure of reality called "this very moment" that's why I will live my life to the fullest and become a flower Why do flowers wither? Why can birds fly? Why do winds blow? Why does the moon shine upon me? Why am I here? Why are you here? Why did I meet you? To have encountered you was a fate. In a world where people come and go like falling flower petals like a dream, it's a miracle to have met you loving each other, fighting each other, getting past various obstacles together even if I'm reborn, I want to see you to fall like flower petals, I will accept everything in this world what you have left me is a treasure of reality called "this very moment" that's why I will live my life to the fullest and become a flower rain stopped, rainbow appeared, the light was born in the blue sky the firm and important thing is to recognize that "you love me" can I walk on? I can see it I hope my feeling can be heard through eternity your happiness, your pain, and your everything come on, bloom with pride, more and more...
