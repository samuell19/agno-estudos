Where are you? I must go. Excuse me. You rang? Who is she? Who? The woman... Her? I think... President Toyama's wife. The famous dancer. Shizuko Toyama. FLOWER AND SNAKE Starring: Aya Sugimoto Another dream... "And now, the winners... for the National Dance Contest. They are dancers... number 141... Kenji Mochida and Shizuko Kisaragi. President Toyama... will present the winner's trophy." Too much stress, huh? What? You had another nightmare. Sorry. This is a pretty loaded schedule. I can see the need for tonight's dinner show... but a TV show tomorrow, too? Sorry. My former manager arranged it. You must take care. Fame can wear your body down. The driver's here. All right. I'm proud my wife's a world famous tango dancer but... I'll be more careful. Must your manager be a pro? No... There is this macho ex-cop... Isn't that right? Yes! Good morning! Good morning! From the agency we use. Yamazaki. Any good? What? A bodyguard... for me? You need one. What if some creep... with a fixation tries to kidnap you? Even Eguchi here is your fan. Right, Eguchi? Yes! See what I mean... Have a good day! Come in. Minister Tomimoto. Thank you for... I have no time today. You brought someone with you? Right. Hey. Please come in. Mikizo Morita, President of Morita Corporation. This is President Toyama. Pleased to meet you. You, too. I've arrived. You mean Mr. Ippei Tashiro? Impressive! Great building... a prime site! 100 billion yen estate indeed. Well done, "Junior". I've heard a lot about him... from my father. This was sent to Mr. Tashiro. Come in. Excuse me. It's here, it's here! - Good job. - Please investigate. - Morita. - Yakuza? And your support for the project? You have it. What did you pay for the site? 50... no...80 billion? Who?! Kazuo Kawada Him? For this great loss... Kawada is to blame. He must resign. All in favor? One more chance, please! I have a family... Agreed! I'd have never guessed... this company to be so huge. Later... I'll call you back. Why? That bastard's as guilty as I am. Revenge, for firing him. What revenge? His wife left, he started gambling... He's in heavy debt. The thing is, our patron hates people like you. Says the war wasn't fought for idiots like you. Let's cut the crap! Name your price! Are you OK? Let's go! Shit! Are you OK? Look what they've done to you. Mrs. Toyama, right? Yes. I'm Kyoko, your new manager-cum-bodyguard. Sure you're not hurt? I thought you'd be a macho guy. I am macho! What do you want? Several billion yen in timely contributions. There must be another way! Give us your wife... the world famous dancer. Why her? If she dances for him... is that worth that much? What's so funny? What do you intend to do? Hey! Stand back! Unfortunately, she's not worth it. She may look hot and sexy... but in fact, she's an ice queen. |know... from failed ballerina to dance champion. Beautiful and talented. Pure as snow. Then, she married you. And now a world-class tango dancer thanks to you. Like a virgin. What a windfall! Don't get it wrong. This is my idea, not Mr. Tashiro's. He just likes... beautiful things. He himself is one of a kind. So what? Give him the rare beauty of your wife... and you're off the hook. And the minister? Why pick on me? He's of no use anymore. His time is over. Lucky you... to have such a hot wife! Who the hell are you? Boss, I know who they are! Call the cops! Shut up! Motherfucker! Fuck you! Boss! The cops... No! Shut up! This is not a game! This is my job. If fail... I must pay with my life. Got it? Or would you rather... I put this on the web? Wait! Give me time. Come in. Mr. Yamazaki. Found out something? Thank you for using... Get to the point! About Ippei Tashiro... Is he alive? He made a fortune in the war in Manchuria... and at over 95 is still in good health. 95? Yes. Though confined to a wheelchair... he still has great influence... over the underworld. Didn't know he's that old. Spooky. And as for Morita... Enough! We'll talk tomorrow. As you wish. Good night. Good night. 95, huh? Is that it? He wants to see her naked? She'll give him a heart attack. I can be off the hook... and save money. Perfect! Her future is at stake too. I need her help! She must! She'll understand. It's our happiness... that's at stake. I have a treatment. You may go. See you on Monday. I'm tired. Too much work. Please... lay on your back. You're back... Sorry, must've fallen asleep... What's the matter? What? Nothing. Dinner? Or shower first? How about... Yes? ...we have some wine. All right. A masked ball? Great! I'll go! Don't you have work then? I can cancel. The new manager is great. And quite macho too. Thanks. I owe you. Don't mention it. Where's the party? I must practice my waltz. Where's that Dead of Winter CD... Practice? You? Who's the host? Well... Mr. Tashiro, a man with great power... over the political world. A fixer? Exactly. My father knew him. Please... let's dance! Now? It's been a while... Ten years. Really? Since the wedding? May I have this dance? With pleasure. He has a huge mansion... and throws parties for politicians... and celebrities. Always invites me, but I'm usually busy. This time though... I must go. He's an old man... and quite a fan of yours. All right? Sorry. It hurts. Sorry. It's not you... It's my fault. Forgive me. Maybe with another man... you'd feel it too. Nonsense... I don't want another man. I'm pitiful. Honey, I've made a decision. I'll work less... and spend more time... caring for you. This should help you... recover your energy. But... your dancing? I won't give it up. Just work less. OK? What's wrong? Let's skip the party. What? It's such late notice and... I'll be fine. Don't worry. No! Why? What's wrong? Nothing. It's just... I'll get it. Yes? "You awake? The minister's dead. Hanged himself." What? When? "Right now. Watch the news tomorrow." Did you bug my house? "We'll be expecting you..." What's wrong? A friend? No... Perhaps we should go tonight. What? How exciting. Yeah. Our guest of honor... the famous tango dancer, Shizuko Toyama. Thanks. May I have this dance? With pleasure. What's wrong? Let's leave.. Sorry. You! Mr. Kawada? "Give me one more chance! I have a family... One more chance..." Madam... may I cut in? Stop it! Easy. easy! What... Let me go! Please! Stop it! I'll pay. It's too late now! No! Shizuko! Don't! Help! Sir... let me do it! I deserve it. No problem. Really? Stars... what the Colosseum needs is stars... or it's the end! I can finally repay my debts. What debts? Fool! Don't you know... Mr. Tashiro raised the boss like his son... Enough! Sorry. Distinguished guests! Tonight's main attraction: The high-class, world-famous... dancer... Madam Shizuko! What's this? You all know her... but is this really her? Show us, madam. Take off your dress! What? Take off your dress! Take it off?! Madam Shizuko! Do as you're told... or the driver dies. No! Madam Shizuko! Take off your dress or he dies. You give us no choice! Oh... you'd rather... he die? I see. As you wish... he shall die! Music, maestro! No! I'll take it off. Splendid. Then, please, take it off! Is this all, madam? Take everything off! A high-class lady indeed! Too bad for the driver. Farewell! Stop it! I'll do it. Stand up! Don't cover yourself! The audience awaits! Show them... your... everything! Do as he says! Show it all! What're you doing? Stop! Do as they say and it will be over. Do it! For the boss! You! Kawada! Hey, doggie! Shut your yelping! Hold her! No! Do it now! Lady, my ass! Hold her! Can't! Can't get it up. Do it, come on! I can't get it up! I can't... What was it all about? I apologize for this. No, no... it's OK. What? MY, Oh, my! The loyal servant burning for revenge... and the noble lady... Alas, the rape failed! What a sorrowful tango! Enough! Release me! Now! Return to your seats please! Release me! Release me! Release me! Take the chains off! Take them off! "It's me." It hurts. Bastards! Help me. I rule! Don't fuck with Yakuza! It's all a show... to see him killed. Don't resist them. Got it? Do as they say... or you'll never... leave this hell. What's this? Let it be a nightmare. Please... Shizuko... Shizuko! Shizuko! Shizuko! Shizuko? Yes, we were supposed to meet... at 13:00, but... she's not here yet. But it's a live broadcast! Did something happen? Mind your own business! What now?! Watch where you're going. The missus needs you. What the hell... It's no good... They're not stupid. What have I done?! Shizuko! Damn it! Mrs. Toyama! Oh, she's awoken! Next up... sold to the mafia by her beloved husband... in return for his debts... the president's wife's learning... the painful way... of becoming a porno star! Madam! But the chaste lady... is in fact... a frigid bitch... and won't cooperate. So the audience is bored... If she continues like this... we'll have to kill her. Her life is in your hands, Kyoko! Now you see it going in... What could it be? Now it's gone. What are you doing? What the fuck is this? A secret show... for a select audience. You heard him. Some of our guests here... they get their kicks from dead bodies. If she's useless alive... they'd love to watch her die. Hey! Look! Poor little Kyoko! Such a cute fighter! So strong... and tough! Missus... if you don't cooperate... poor Kyoko will suffer. Behold! The master of pain! Trainer Onigen. Who the fuck? Don't touch me! Oh, oh! Poor girl. Poor little Kyoko! What unbearable pain! Do as they say, or she'll die! Poor naked madam! Hasn't relieved herself for 12 hours. Can't if we watch. Why? Coz she's a real lady. But that's bad for the body. Right? A moment ago though... we gave her a diuretic. Pee or poor Kyoko will suffer. Don't listen to him! Don't! Be strong! "Don't! Be strong! Like me! Don't listen to him!" So you still won't? Well, I have no choice. Her clothes... shall be stripped off! Well done, Shizuko! Shall we go on? You're the stars now! Madam Shizuko, sold out... by her husband, and her bodyguard. A tragic lesbian show! Why would he... Why'd he do this? That's right. He sold her for several billion. No! Yes, he did. He's a coward! A weak man turned alcoholic. No! Right. He's useless. Left all the work to us and drank. Jealousy made him an alcoholic. Useless! Liar, liar! Enter Kyoko! What the... You son of a bitch! Stop it! No! So... what'|| be her fate? She'll go mad soon. You're all she has. Will you save her? Really? You agree? All right! Let the show begin! Now... Let yourself go! Let your inhibition go free! Release yourself! Golden rain will fall. In and out... front and back. What will happen when the water starts flowing... what? Mrs. Toyama... They're watching us. Fake it if you must! Otherwise, they'll kill you. Understand? Listen to me! Pretend you enjoy it... and we might get a chance to escape. Sorry for this. It's OK. You wanna get fucked, do you? Want me to fuck you? Bitch! |won't hurt you... just pretend to enjoy it... please. I'm all confused. I love you so much. I always watch you, even on TV. And now, to be able to do this... it's wonderful! If they kill us here in the mountains... no one will ever find us. He sold you for several billion... bought himself out... I'll be over. Get out! Both of you! Run! This way! This place... Is this the way? I think so. That door... Something's wrong! What? Like before... Before? It's a trap! No! Kyoko! Are you OK? Bastards! Welcome back to the Rape & Snuff show... ladies and gentlemen! For your enjoyment... this angelic face and tough body! Stay away! No! Don't kill her! Please! Don't! Please! I'll do anything. Don't kill her. It's me. Promise? If it's a lie, I'll stick needles in you. Please, forgive me! Madam! I'm so sorry! What's wrong? Yeah, yeah! Yeah! Don't be shy... let me see. Were you a naughty girl? Yes! Were you? Speak up! Yes! Were you? Then I have to spank you! I hope you enjoyed our whore show! It's time for the grand finale! She's faking? No way! Onigen's a professional. She came! Gave me a hard-on, too! No, Mr. Tashiro said... she still hasn't shown her real face. Real face? This location isn't safe anymore. Someone might speak. We must use our last resort. The last? Here's one billion yen. It's all I have. Let her go... I mean it! Let her go, or I go to the police. The truth is... What? ...she's having so much fun... and doesn't want to come back. What? She knows how you sold her out. And now... It's all I have! How about... you come and convince her to return. So this is the Colosseum... Annual membership 50 million... and a million per show. There are 100 members. Strictly intellectuals, stars and celebrities. It's their fantasyland.
