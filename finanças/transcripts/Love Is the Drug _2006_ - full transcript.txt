Shakespeare, finally. Really appropriate today, right? Because he writes about all the things that you might be feeling right now. Really good. Really nice choice. Jonah. You did bring something to read, didn't you? - Yes. It's an excerpt from a novel about the Beat generation called The Other Side of Here. It's by Samantha Carabinas. Even those who thought they knew her paint her as a simple girl. The kind of woman who smiled more than she frowned and laughed more than she cried. She was unaware of this misconception about herself, as most people are when it comes to judging how they are perceived by the strangers they call friends. When people think you're an open book, they are less likely to actually read the words printed on the pages, and this was never more true than it was for Jane. She was so simple and so guileless she was a mystery. And such a mystery that everyone who thought they had her figured out were wrong. (clapping) Very nice, Jonah. Always refreshing to hear anyone other than Kerouac or Ginsburg from that school of thought. Now Mr. Cooper, what have you brought to celebrate the final day of your high school career? (upbeat rock music) (moaning) (chattering) (moaning) - What? - Lucas, get the fuck out of here! - On your best friend's mama's bed, nice touch. - Lucas. Get the fuck out. - Hey, you seen Sara or Troy anywhere? - No, now get the fuck out of here! - Oh, you want privacy? - Get the fuck out. - Hey, just let me know how my dick tastes when you're done, all right man? - Close the fucking door! - What's the magic word? - Asshole! (chattering) - Yo. Jackass. Have you seen Troy? - In there, dude. - Oh ya, you betcha. You betcha, baby. (gasps) - Get the fuck in here and shut the door. - Ooh. - Love to play Santa, but there is only enough for three. - Yeah, looks like somebody's had some already. - I do not do drugs, Lucas, you fucker. - The lady is always first. - Yeah well, a lady doesn't suck down four lines that fucking fast, man. (gasps) - I was doing it for you, Lucas. - Really? - Yes, that's what friends do, they look out for one another. - Really, who told you we're friends? - Oh, ouch, ow. (fake crying) All right. We're going to the party. - Mingle. - Yes we must, come on. - I've already been out there, it's not worth it. - It's last time. - Wait, will you hold on a second, I wanna... (upbeat music) (chattering) (steady rock music) - Sorry. - You're Jonah. - Yeah, yeah. And you're Sara. - We were in Miss Waters' English class together. I don't know, it's like this weird coincidence. - What is? - The piece that you read. Well my mom, she played Samantha Carabinas in this cable movie about the Beats. She was an actress, or she is an actress still, kind of. I guess. - Well, I'll have to watch it. - Yeah, don't bother, it's kind of not so good. - I'm sure I'd like it. I'm a complete nut about anything about those guys. - Typical boy. - Me? - Yeah. You know, into all those ultra cool, hipster San Francisco writers. - Oh, so I'm a cliche. - Oh. Yeah, I don't think I'd say you were a cliche. - Well, neither are you. - Thank you. - Water, baby girl. - Oh, thank you baby. Oh, Lucas, Troy, this is... - Jonah. Brand. - You went to Hartwood? - Yeah, we had American history sophomore year, and this year we had trig. - Oh yeah, I remember you. Back seat, third row, right? - Cool, it's great to meet you, man. Put her there. Feel like going for a swim, dude? - Lucas, don't be a dick, just let him go, please. - You hear that man? She wants me to let you go. Yo, what the fuck, man? - [Troy] I'm sorry, I couldn't... (laughing) Very fucking funny. (laughs) - So, Jonah Brand of the Cobra City Brands, how'd you end up at this little shindig, anyway? - Everyone at Hartwood knew about it. - Yeah, but everybody wasn't invited, were they? - I was. - Really? By who? - Myself. - You cold, kid? - Not too bad. - Those are some nice jeans you got there, Jonah. - Thanks. - No, seriously, get yourself a little knockoff top, you'll have a whole fucking outfit. - Shut up, don't listen to him, okay? Everything's beneath Lucas because he's so fabulous and fantastic. - Me and this kid wearing Van nines like what, four days ago we were hanging out, it's not fabulous. - Need I say more? - Whatever. - Fuck this shit, let's go smoke. - Yeah, good idea. Coming, Pee Wee? - No, I should probably be getting home. - But-- - Damn, brother. - It's not even midnight yet, where you gonna go? - I gotta work. - We just graduated, you're supposed to enjoy this last season in the sun. - Exactly. - Where do you work? - At a pharmacy. - Like a pharmacy pharmacy? - Yeah. - Nice job. - It's really no big deal, I just deliver prescriptions for people. Like old people and stuff. - Can you get benzos? Because you know, if you take two benzos and then you drink a glass of Merlot, that's like the greatest thing in the entire world. - Yeah, especially if you do it on the back of an eight ball, it's fucking perfect. - Or a vici-S. That shit rocks. - Yes, I love that, can you get that? - I don't know, I-- - What, dude, like you never dip. - Well, only if you can't get caught. Right? - Exactly. So Jonah, what's your phone number? - Mine? - Yeah, your number, give it to me. - Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, 310. - Yeah. - [Jonah] 555. - [Lucas] 555, yeah. - [Jonah] 4847. - 4847, great. Jonah Brand. Who would've known you were so full of endless possibilities, man? (bird chirping) (dog barking) - Morning honey. - Morning. - [Mom] How'd you sleep? - All right. - Oh. You know they had a bomb threat at LAX this morning? - How would that matter to us? We haven't left this city since we moved here. - Couldn't, it was Hartwood. - Not my idea. Public would've been fine by me. - And you'd be fine with community college. Oh, okay. Then I won't worry about taking a second mortgage for your tuition. - No mom, I want to go to UCLA. Okay? Thank you. - All right. (phone ringing) I'll get it. Hello? Stephen. No no no, it's okay, I'm glad you called. Tonight? I'm working nights all week, but this weekend would be good. - It must be so awesome. - What? - Not having to go to stupid high school ever again. God, it's like the worst part in anyone's entire life. I bet Hartwood was pretty cool, though. - For some people. - Yeah. You have to be really smart to go there. And you're really smart. Know where you're going to college yet? - UCLA. - Oh. - Claire, Jonah has three more deliveries before noon. - Dad, we were only talking. Don't be such an asshole. - Mrs. Hanlin called me twice this morning. Could you drop off her prescription on your next run? - No problem. - Hey, you know I was thinking. After you start school, if you want to stay on that is, we could try adjusting deliveries around your class schedule. Had to work my way through college myself. - That'd be cool. (upbeat rock music) Fuck! (phone ringing) Hello? I mean, (clears throat) what up? - [Lucas] Jonah. It's Lucas. Bring us drugs. So, what you up to this Thursday afternoon? - You know, just chilLing. - [Lucas] Well we're hanging poolside at Sara's if you want to come by, grace us with your latest Cobra City couture. - Right, right. I just got a few things to do around the house and then I'll be right over. - [Lucas] Outstanding Brand, outstanding. - All right. (upbeat rock music) Later. - Think I should get a nose job? - Erin, please, come on, you know your nose is adorable. - Yeah, but this magazine says that a man looks for symmetry in a woman's face. It says that your lower lip should be exactly 20% larger than your upper lip. Which means I need a nose job, because if you'll look at me, please, my left eye is obviously closer to my right eye. - Okay, stop talking, let me see. No, your nose is perfect. - Really? - Yes, Erin, and you shouldn't even be reading that thing anyway, it's biased. A cosmetic surgeon wrote it. (giggling) Go away. - Thank you. - No. (upbeat rock music) (doorbell rings) - What'd you fall into a fucking well or something? - [Jonah] No. - Shut up and let me see what you got, what did you bring? - [Jonah] I couldn't get anything. - Are you fucking kidding me? - [Jonah] No. Well I, no, I think... But I think I found a way to get some. - Good, not a moment too soon. Come on. What do you think of the digs? - It's all right. - You want a beer? I'm gonna grab a beer. Yeah, let's have a beer while our hostess explores the limits of good taste in the garden. - Hey, shouldn't we tell them that I'm here or something? - Heel Rover, okay? They know. The question is do they give a shit. - I think Sara might. - I think she wouldn't. Don't you remember her freshman year, she was quite the wanton whore? - Lucas, they can seriously be so tedious. - Then why the fuck are you out there watching them? - I don't like to watch, Lucas. You oughta know that. I'm Erin. - Oh, right. Erin, this is Jonah, Jonah, this is Erin. - Oh yeah, you were that kid that got thrown into the pool, right? - Yeah, yeah, and you're the girl that was upstairs at the party. (chuckles) - Someone here has a big fucking mouth. - It's not as big as-- - Lucas. - What? - Can you pour me a fucking drink please, so I can leave? - What are you talking about, I thought you were coming to Joseph's with us tonight? - Nope, Darren Zaft is taking me to dinner. - Really. Darren Zaft, huh? He's such a nice Jewish boy, that one, he's a real fucking mensch. - How about just give me the fucking drink. - What do you think I'm doing? Here. - Nice to meet you. - Yeah, nice to meet you. - A barrel of fucking sunshine, right? - Hey Jonah, what's up? - Hi. - How you doing, buddy? Let's smoke pot. - Okay. I don't want you guys to make fun of me but I've been thinking, and I've decided that I am going to do something different and important with my life, like travel to far away places and help needy people. - What the fuck are you talking about? Like you're honestly gonna be able to feed starving stick children with fucking dysentery gruel? - Well, I wouldn't feed them gruel, retard, I'm gonna feed them something good, like strawberries. - Yeah please, the fucking lack of Starbucks alone would have you on the first flight back. - You wouldn't go there in the first place. - Dude, you wouldn't go in the first place either, what are you talking about? - Yeah, no shit, man. Encino's as third world as I'll journey. - My god, you guys are so fucking-- - Smart? - Yeah, smart. No, you're selfish and you're assholes. - Well, my selfish soul, (speaking gibberish) is rescuing you from your strawberry philanthropy and taking you straight to Europe for a year's worth of (whispering) - My white knight. - Yeah, that's all contingent on the fact that you may not even get into Brown, remember? Smart ass? - Yeah, well, I'm gonna get in. If I can impress the hell out of them. - I cannot believe that they are flying you out there for an interview, that's like the stupidest thing I ever heard. - It's fucking Brown, all right? It's not UC Berkley, what do you expect? - Berkley is a good school. - Yeah well, it may be good, but it's not good enough for Troy Daniels of the California Constructions Daniels here. No see, only the most esteemed Ivy league east coast schools are good enough for our boy here. Isn't that right? - Not if I don't get through this interview. - Shh. You are going to be brilliant. - Yeah, he's always brilliant. Brilliant fucking brilliant. Shit yo, it's like nine, we should probably be going guys. - Wait, where are you guys going? - Joseph's. Chevo is spinning tonight. You should come with us. - Whoa, hey, easy, easy fellas, okay, let's not go crazy here. And I'm not trying to be a dick here, but the kid's been smoking our weed, drinking our beer all friggin' day, I just think it's time for a little reciprocation. - Shut up, okay, of course you can come with us. Now, I am going to go get dressed. Jesus. (chuckles) I am all right. - [Troy] All right. - I have money. - Oh you have money? Oh that's great man, what did your mom give you what, a raise in your allowance? Hey look dude, come here, come on. It's all copacetic, okay? But I just think it's time you chipped in a little bit, you know? And I figured you got this job, why not share the wealth, you understand what I'm saying? - Yeah, yeah. - Because we try to help each other out, you know? Friends help friends help friends, and we're all friends, right? - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, we're definitely friends. - Great, great, great. Okay, now, you know I'm not asking for the world here, right? It's just a little taste, a little something something. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. - Great man. - [Troy] See you later, Jone. - Yeah, thanks Troy, later. Hey. - Yeah? - Tell Troy I said goodbye. - Oh yeah yeah yeah, you got it. - No, not Troy, Sara.

(upbeat electronic music) - So I hear this guy Danny's kinda ghetto, but he's supposed to be cool, so. - Where did you meet this guy, anyway? - I didn't. Troy did. Surfing, it sounds like. - Oh god, another surfer. Breeding sounds impeccable. Is he cute? - How the fuck should I know? I haven't met him yet. - Well if he's not, someone there is, and they are going to loan me dick.

Jonah, I seriously think you should probably try and get yourself a little trim tonight at this party, okay? - [Erin] Yeah. - Wait, what do you mean? - He means stop jerking off to Sara and find your own fucking pussy. (chuckles) - Yeah, well I wasn't gonna say it like that, but yeah. - My way's funnier. - And it's probably not a good idea to call her while Troy's at Brown this weekend either. - Seriously. - You guys are assholes. - Dude, I'm not holding it against you man, okay? All I'm saying is that jerking off to Sara is as close as you're gonna get, all right? Buy some tissues. (Erin laughs) - I don't do that. (laughing) - Yeah right. Look at his hand like frozen in the position. (laughs) - Yeah, and this is coming from the chick that fucking fell asleep while using her battery operated. - Lucas. - Didn't you get like a yeast infection from that or something? - I was drunk. Can you shut up? He's lying. - We seriously shouldn't be in the same car with this chick. - Have you no restraint? - Not when it comes to yeast infections. - [Erin] Fuck you. - Yo, Jonah, do me a favor though? - Yeah. - When we get to the party, we're gonna go in first, just wait like five minutes before you come in. You know, so we don't get all crowded, you know, we can have our space. You get it, right? You know what I mean? - Yeah. - Good. (hip hop music) - What the fuck... Who the fuck are you? - Who are you? - I'm the guy whose house you're partying in. - Oh, sorry, Danny right? - Do I know you? - No, no, I'm a friend of Troy's. - Troy? - Yeah. - Oh, yeah, I got you homes, yeah. Dude's fucking dope on a board. - Excuse me? - He's a shredder. - Oh, yeah, yeah. I hear he's very talented. - Hey Jonah. - Hey. You danced really well. (laughs) - Yeah. How come you're not getting out there, Jonah Jone? - I don't know, I don't feel like it I guess. - You're so funny. - Why's that? - I don't know, it's like you're two different people sometimes, or something. Like tonight you're quiet, but at karaoke you were crazy. - Which one do you like better? - I don't know. - Excuse me, excuse me. Hey man, you thirsty? - Thanks. - All right, all right. You having fun? - Sure. - Hey, you liar. - We gotta hit the hay, baby girl. - Okay. - Ooh. See, now that is what I love about Sara. I might not get to bang her, but she's gold about giving it away, you know? Take some notes. (loud rock music) - Lucas. - You okay, man? (chattering) - Come on. Almost to the car. - [Lucas] You need to find you a new boyfriend. - [Sara] I know. - [Lucas] This one's broken. - He's broken. You're so heavy. - Whoa, watch your head, watch your head. (laughing) All right. Here, give me your hand. You take this, you call me if you need anything, all right? Lay back and try and get some sleep, you'll feel better. - All right. - Bye. I love you. I'll see you in the morning. - Okay. - Let's go see if that chick has a friend, man. Try and get you laid. - Well... You think someone should stay with him? - Right. Watch one of your boys sleep or go get my balls licked, that's a tough question. You're on your own. - Hey Troy. Are you gonna be okay? - Fuck you, man. - All right. Hey, watch your feet. - All right. Thanks man. - Yeah. - [Sara] Jonah Jone. Jonah Jone! (steady dance music) (doorbell rings) (crying) (screams) (siren wailing) (banging) - Sara come on, open the goddamn door, we're gonna be late. - I'm almost ready. - Look, I don't care what you're doing in there, all right, just finish it up and get out here, everybody's waiting. - Okay, just two more seconds. - You said that 20 minutes ago, now hurry up. What the fuck are you doing here? - I was just driving by and... - Didn't I tell you we'd meet you at the funeral? - Yeah. I don't know, I saw your car so I thought I'd stop and... - She won't come out. - Hey Sara, it's me Jonah. Hey, listen, you can ride with me to the funeral if you'd like. - What the fuck is that? - Sara, please just get out here, okay? It's not gonna take that long, but we gotta do this, all right? - Hi. - How did you get up there? - I flew. Or I just used your mom's window. - I'm trying to get ready. Lucas is banging on the door and he's rushing me. I'm not finished with my makeup, and I can't find my ring. I don't really want to go unless I have... Thank you. (banging) - [Lucas] Enough already. Let's go, Sara, come on. - Your resourcefulness is fucking annoying sometimes. (birds chirping) - I'm gonna go talk to her. - Sweetie, you're sorry. - No I'm not. - [Erin] Sara. - You know, maybe you should wait. You know, until after the reception. - I'm not going to the reception. (chattering) Mrs. Daniels? I wanted you to know... I wanted to... - Why are you here? - Excuse me? God. I should've listened to you. I can't believe that I talked to his mom like that. - She didn't know what she was saying. - She knew what she was saying. - Lucas. - What? Fuck her anyway, she was (mumbling) - No she didn't. - Sara. In his mom's eyes, Troy could do no wrong, you know that. - Come on Lucas, all parents are like that. - Not mine. - Thank you. I think that we should go over there. - Why would we go-- - I think that we should apologize. - Apologize for what? We didn't do anything wrong. - We didn't do anything? What the fuck are you talking about? We were all with him, Lucas. We put him in the car. - No, Troy did that to himself, you know that. - Well we didn't have to put him in the car. - He didn't have to get so fucked up, now did he? - What are you talking about? He was your best friend. - You don't think I know that? - Well you're not really acting like it. - How the fuck am I supposed to act? - I don't know, but you're not supposed to act like this. - Hey! Hey. (sighs) - Sara, I'm sorry, okay? Just... Don't listen to me, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, all right? - I'm sorry too.

I don't know, they'd all be partying, it's just stupid. - [Man] Sara Weller? - Yeah? - I'm Phil Heckwith, I'm a friend of the Daniels family. Sure hope you girls are using a sunscreen with a high SPF rating. I use 75 myself. At my pool, at a beach. Clarence. Never heard of it. - Yeah, that's 'cause it's from Barney's. - Good. I like Barney's. - Yeah, I can tell. - Erin. - What? - Just come on. - Look, I was sorry to hear about Troy. I didn't know him, but from what his parents told me, he was a hell of a kid. - Well how do you know his parents? - I'm sort of an employee. Hired to find out about his passing. - Find out what? - Oh, you know. This and that. - We already told them everything we know. And we also told the police. - Either one of you know what flunitrazepam is? Date rape drug? - Yeah? - Either of you take some that night? - No, I've never even seen that stuff before. - Yeah, well, Troy did. A lot of it, from what we know. - What do you mean a lot? - Oh, far more than he should. And considering the level of alcohol and cocaine in his blood... You know it's a class A misdemeanor just to possess that stuff? And to sell it? That's a felony, six years minimum. You just give it to someone, and the court considers as if you sold it. But that's hard to prove without an eyewitness, you know. If someone gave someone a roofie, like they did to Troy. - Yeah, wow. What you're saying is just so interesting. But we're done listening to you now, so why don't you just troll your little ass right back out the gate from where you came, okay? - I was just hoping one of you might be able to tell me who gave it to him? - No. - Would Lucas Sutherland know? Jonah Brand? - They never mentioned it. - Ah, you know what? I'll just ask them myself. I'm sorry to interrupt you ladies. Clarence. I'm gonna have to remember that word. - Fucking creep. I'm so sorry. That guy was such a douchebag. (light rock music) - My son is not a druggie. - That true, Jonah? - Yes. - Never tried cocaine? - No. - Never had a puff off a joint before? - He's an 18 year old boy growing up in Los Angeles, okay? Doesn't that question answer itself? - I wouldn't want to meet a saint even if I had the opportunity, right? Would you? You and Sara were quite close, weren't you Jonah? - She's my friend. - Not your girlfriend. - She's Troy's girlfriend. - Not anymore, is she? - My son already answered you, okay? He told you he doesn't know when or where Troy got those roofies, so if you have a question, I would just appreciate it if you could just ask him, Jonah will answer it, and you can leave our home. - Well I did ask a question. - Sara still loves Troy. - Well I guess that's it. - Done now? - Yep. - Okay. - That guy's a fucking scumbag. What the fuck are Troy's parents doing sending around an errand boy for them in the first place? - They can't blame us. - They're totally blaming us. - No, they're blaming whoever gave Troy the roofies. - Yeah, and we're lucky he didn't ask us to take a blood test to see if we'd fucking taken any. - I don't even know what they are. - Well you should've told the golf shirt detective that, Jonah, then you would've completely exonerated yourself. - I'm not trying to exonerate myself from anything, Lucas. - Is that why you told him you don't do blow, Jonah? Huh? Oh, oh, no, Mr. golf shirt fuckhead, no, I don't do cocaine, I'm an angel walking among the fallen, my system is as pure as the fucking snow. - I haven't done anything to you. - Are you fucking kidding me? - I mean it. - Oh, you mean it. Look who's trying to grow some fucking balls all of a sudden-- - Will you shut the fuck up? - This fucking prick, he's driving me crazy. - Well maybe I should go. - Yeah, you know what? Maybe you should. - No. I don't want you to. - Thank you. - Just stop. (sighs) - All right, so nobody knows where Troy got the roofies, right? So why don't we go find out then? - It could've been a million people there. - We didn't even know who threw that party. - Then fucking whatever, let's go over there and let's ask and let's find out who was selling the fucking-- - What good is that gonna do, Lucas? - It could be making it worse. - Fuck that, it can't get worse. - I'm just thinking about his parents. - Well they certainly aren't thinking about any of us, now are they? - Why do you have to be such a prick? - Because it's the primal core of my being. - Fuck you. - Hey gladly, just name the place. - That's not funny. - Sara, I'm sorry, it's... Ah, shit. - I'm gonna go get a beer. - Can you get me a vodka and OJ? - Yo, could you grab me a beer too, if that's cool? - Sure.

Tall kid? - That cornbread looking mother fucker? - Yeah. - That cat is a straight hoover bag, you know that? - What do you mean? - I mean I watched him do a quart of G in five minutes. - Yeah, sounds like Troy. - It's fucked up, yo.

I'm sorry! - Jonah? - Sorry I'm late, I'll get to work right now. - You all right? - Have you ever done something to someone that you shouldn't have? - God, I'm so stupid. I'm such a fucking idiot. - No. I slept with lots of guys when I was drunk, okay? It's not-- - Erin, it's different than that. You know that it is. You haven't ever done anything, ever, like I just did to Troy. - Okay. But it's not all your fault. - It's not like we meant for it to happen. We didn't go down there planning on doing anything. - You didn't. - Don't say that. - Jonah. Get in the car. Get in the fucking car. Guess where I just stopped at, Jonah. Can you guess? Guess who just told me you sold the drugs to Troy? - No. - No? No, don't you fucking lie to me, you little piece of shit. Don't you fucking lie to me. He knew your name, Jonah.

Go work. - Hey, Jonah. Wanna go to lunch? You all right? - Yeah. Yeah, I'll go. - Cool. Let me change real quick. Stupid lab jackets are so gross. - Hey! Your fucking faggot stock boy is stealing drugs from you! He's handing out pills like it's fucking Christmas! Go on you fucking faggot! Fucking tell him! - How about Chinese? - You know it's a federal offense to steal medication? At any level? That boy wasn't lying, was he. Jonah, I'm gonna let you go. Right now, in fact. (steady rock music) - What are you doing here? - Doing what you do in a place like this. Picking up my medication. See you later, kid. (steady rock music) - Well aren't you full of surprises. - I've been calling. - Yeah. I've been crazy busy. - Doing what? - What are you doing in my back yard, Jonah? - I worry, Sara. I just want to make everything right. - What? - Tijuana. I'm really sorry. - It was a mistake. - But I can be better, so much better. - It's not about that. - I know, I know, but see, that's why I want to fix it. Because I know I can, if you just let me. Will you let me? Please? - I think you need to go. - He thought a lot of himself, didn't he? Troy. Everyone at Hartwood thought a lot about themselves. And why shouldn't they, when they have so much and I have... But you. - You need to go. - That first night, the first night you spoke to me. You wanted to be my friend because I knew who Samantha Carabinas was. It was unimaginable. It was everything I ever wanted. Then there was Troy. Touching you, grabbing you, and kissing you. - Jonah. - You remember singing to me? - No. - At karaoke. - I was singing to Troy. - No, no, see, you sang to me. - By all means, man, have one more. - I know you did. You sang to me for a moment, and I knew it then. I knew you cared then. - Jonah, I do care, okay, but I love Troy. - But you sang to me. - So? - Then we danced together. - Jonah. - And we got high together. - None of that means anything. - No, it did, it did mean something! I'm sorry. I'm... God. Sorry. Sara. I want to confront the situation. - Jonah, just forget TJ, okay? - No, no, not that. The night with Troy at the party. - Jesus fucking Christ. Come on, Jonah. Never had blow like this man, look at it. It's practically fucking yellow. You know this night is it, right? When I stop being me and start being some guy that I don't even fucking know. Join the Cig Eps. Just like Pops. What do they call that shit? What do they call it? - Call what? - You know, fucking, a legacy. I'm gonna be a jackass legacy. Pathetic. - I'm gonna go. - You can't go, Jonah Jone. - I'm gonna get home. - Yeah, you know it, man, you fucking know it. Anyway, come here. - I gave him the pills, and I bought them for him, but I swear, I didn't know what they would do. - You gotta have something to take the edge off. - Yo, fuck that, you fucked up enough. - I know, all right? I got three roofies, I'll give you half of one. - I'll buy two off you for 50 bucks. - Fuck that, you'll go down for good. - You believe me, right? - It's not gonna do shit. Fuck you too. - You understand. - Jonah, come here. Do me a favor, all right? Go buy those two roofies off him. - Yeah, but he just said... - I'm sorry about going off like that, all right? The hum's fucking with my head. Do me a favor and hook that shit up, all right? You wouldn't want Sara to see me like this, would you? - My boss fired me today because he found about me stealing the pills. The pills that I've been stealing for you. - Can you hook me up with those two roofies? - So you can go give 'em to hoover bag in there? - No, no, they're for me. And Sara. - If he reports me, I go to jail. But not if you come with me. If you come with me, then we can go to Tijuana, and I can make it right between us, the way it's supposed to be. I can get pills, and I can get money, but you, just say you'll come with me. Come with me please. Please. - Okay. - Okay.

(screaming) - No, it was an accident. - Who cares if it was an accident or it wasn't an accident, all right? - You're the one who said that Troy killed himself. - Yeah, that was before I knew Jonah bought him the pills and fucking gave them to him. - You know, he didn't know what he was doing. - Think about this for a second. The little cocksucker's infatuated with you, all right? And do you honestly think that he was helping Troy by feeding him a bunch of pills a drug dealer wouldn't even give him? - You don't even want to hear his side of the story. - Jesus Christ. - You never liked him. - It's like talking to fucking wallpaper. - You can shut up now. - Shut up-- - We've heard enough. You're harassing her-- - Chill the fuck out, I am chill, she's not listening. - Just leave her alone. God. - Never met anyone with a bigger fucking mouth, seriously. - Uh huh. - Just don't talk.

God dammit. (doorbell rings) Want one? - No. - Come on. - I don't want it, Jonah. I just said I don't want it. - You know I watched you. From the first day I saw you at Hartwood. Our freshman yeah, you wore long skirts, and you brought bagged lunches and you played tennis. And in sophomore year, you stopped bringing bagged lunches and you started wearing miniskirts. And then junior year, no more tennis, nothing. Just Troy. I would've given anything to be him. But I was Jonah Brand. Kid without a car, no friends. Whose mom drove him to school 'til he was a senior. How could I talk to you? It was an impossibility. Until I saw your mom in that movie, a week before graduation. - You lied. - I know. And I'm sorry, and I'm really sorry. - It's okay, Jonah. It's really okay. - But it worked, didn't it? It worked. You talked to me, you finally talked to me after four years of being invisible. I mean, that's all I ever wanted was your friendship. - We are friends, Jonah, okay, we're friends. But that's it. - No. Not anymore. Not after Mexico. - Please let go of my hand, Jonah. - I'm so stupid. - Please let go. Please. - You know Lucas? - Yeah, we met. - I'll go get Sara. (suspenseful music) - It's your favorite.
