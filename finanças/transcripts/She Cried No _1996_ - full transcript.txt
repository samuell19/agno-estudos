Psychology major. - Jordan McCann, music. - Melissa Connell. Math, I guess. - Good, I'm terrible in math. - That must be my stuff. - The guy who brought mine up was a dork. - Hello Melissa. - Hi. - The men of Kappa Pi are always at your service, ladies. If you need me, I'll be around, you have my number. - Trying to steal my job, Baker? - I wouldn't think of it. - Take care, bye bye. - Hi. - Glad you made it. Thanks. - You two know each other? - Yeah, she's my brother's girlfriend. - Actually, he's my boyfriend. Hi, I'm Holly Essex, second floor resident advisor. Any questions? - I, yes, actually. What happens if somebody plays grunge real loud? I can't study to negative music. - Let me guess, only child? - Yes. But I've always wanted sisters. This is gonna be so much fun. - Well, if you have any other questions I'll be down the hall. - Thanks. - Bye. - Bye. - So, does anybody want to go to the gym? - It's the only place I applied. My parents went here, my brother, too. It's family tradition. - I'm the first one in my family to get as far as college it's 'cause I got a scholarship. at school, right? - Oh it's a great school, especially the music department. - Who's that? - Uh, new girl. - Did you call me this morning? I thought I heard the phone ringing as I walked out the door. - Yeah. - Good, last night, what blur, you know? It's all weird and choppy. - What do you mean? - I don't really remember what happened. - Oh. Don't stress, you were great. - So, we'll get together later, huh? - Yeah, sure. Maybe this weekend? - Cool. Bye. - I'll see ya. Hey. - Hi. - There's a kickoff costume party at the house this week, maybe you and your friend, would like to come? - I'm Jordan. - Scott. You know, get some partying in before they load you down on homework. - Thanks, we'll give it serious consideration. - Sounds like fun. - All right, cool. - He's cute. Wanna go? - Oh, no, my boyfriend, Kevin's coming up next weekend. - You and Kevin, you know, serious or? - Yeah, he's the only guy I've ever hooked up with. - Never done it with anyone. You know, it sounds sort of retro but, my sisters went boy crazy and dropped out of high school. Now they're working for minimum wage. So I wanna keep my eye on my goal. Carnegie Hall or bust. - Good for you. Wish I had a goal. - Carry my bag? - And why would I wanna do that? - To take a stand for equality and because I'm just so gosh darn cute. - Nobody's that cute. - Advanced calculus, this is where I get off. - Me too. - What? - You're a freshman. - Advanced placement. - I see, well, after you. Not to psych you out or anything. But, your whole future hinges on the grade you get in this class. - Oh, well if you panic and fall behind just knock at my door, I'll try and explain it to you. - Smart and nurturing. There's gotta be a catch, I'm guessing, hometown honey, am I right? - How'd you know? - Hm, story of my life. Afternoon, ladies and gentleman. - Of course I understand. Uh-huh. Yeah, I know things might change again. Yes, stay in touch. Bye. - Hey. Wanna talk about it? - I just want to be alone. - Michael! Where do I put the jungle juice, buddy? Right there, bro, at the end. - Guys, we are gonna get lucky tonight! Even you, Leland. What are you laughing at, you need some help, too. - The world won't end if she skips one party. - Besides I don't have anything to wear. - Why didn't you say so? Just go plunder my closet, like a real sister would. Here, my mother bought this and it's well, it's just so not me, but I felt guilty to throw it away, here. It's yours, viola. Just tie some rubber bands around your ankles and you're all set. - To be what, exactly? A harem girl, silly. A genie, gypsy, whatever. - Thanks but, my stomach will show. - You could just suck it in. - Starve until the party. What about me? Do I look fat in this? I've been feeling really bloated lately. It's really. - And for their dining pleasure we have chips. Or, jello. - Just because a guy hands you a beer doesn't mean you have to drink it. - If she takes a drink, she wants to party. If she doesn't, try a jello shot. - Use the buddy system. - Get a girl up to your room. You don't want to be disturbed, leave your shoes outside. - What if she still says no? - It's like any negotiation. First no is only a starting point. - Kellie, come on, come on, come on, let's go. - You're fine, let's go. - Beautiful. Whatever you do, don't do anything. I'm not planning to do it at all. According to this survey I read, most people know in the first 30 seconds whether they've got chemistry or not. It took Mike and me a year to realize we were more than just friends. - This party is not about getting a guy. I just want to have fun. - Ow! I want the gypsy. - Sorry, she's taken. - I'm Leland, Kappa Pi paparazzi. - I'm Jordan. What's that for? - Oh, historical purposes. - Hi. Hey, Mel. - Ooh, tough call, let's see, house sit for my parent's lake house by the lake? Or watch your brothers throw up and pass out? - Well if you put it that way. - What's going on, Mike? Hey bro. - Hey Holly. - Hi. - What are you supposed to be? moose. - Gypsy, genie, whatever. - Really, I've always wanted a girl to call me master. - Don't you dare. - Get out of here, you're depressing me. - Are you sure you're gonna be warm enough in that? - Yeah Dad. - Bye bye. - Bye. - Bull race is over, who's up for some quarters? - Do you wanna play? - No, not right now. - Sure, it's a fun game. All right. Feel goofy in this hat. You look really great tonight, you know that? - Thanks. - You want something to drink? - Hey princess. - Here you are. - I really should get something to eat. - Okay, uh, help yourself. - No. - Candy bar? - No. - Jello shooter? They're good, try one. Gotta finish it off with one of these. Tradition. - I really should eat something first. - Okay, uh, tomato juice. Thanks man. It's loaded with nutrients. Trust me. Here you go. Having fun? Good. - Yeah. - Can we talk, Scott? - Just one second. I thought you were gonna be with me tonight? - I am. Later, she's Connell's sister, and he's out, he made me swear to look out for her. - You're looking at her, not out for her. - Don't crowd me, Courtney, or there's not gonna be a later. - I just really wanna be with you, okay? I need to talk to you. - Fine, we'll talk later, all right? I promise, okay? Sorry, she sort of has a major crush on me. - Oh, do you go out with her? - Uh, everybody goes out with her, she's sort of the house mascot. ♪ When I dance they call me Macarena ♪ ♪ And the boys they say it's muy buena ♪ ♪ They all want me, they can't have me ♪ ♪ So they all come and dance beside me ♪ ♪ Move with me, chant with me ♪ ♪ And if you could I'll take you home with me ♪ - Whoa! ♪ Now don't you worry about my boyfriend ♪ ♪ The boy who's name is Ricordino ♪ ♪ I don't want him, I can't stand him ♪ - That's all right, honey, you just hang on to me.

Who's gonna take care of you? She needs to lie down, she's had a little bit too much to drink. - Oh yeah, me too. Slow down, let's go get Jordan. Wanna go? Easy, Baker! - Where's Jordan? - This way. You like this song? - It's okay. Oh wait. No, Scott, really I'm not into this. - You're not into this? You look into it, you'll feel into it. - Scott, stop! Stop! Scott, stop! No! - Hey, don't go anywhere. It's time. Whoa. Party foul, party foul. Party's just gettin' started. I guess, no fights. - Melissa! - Hi. You too wasted to make it to school today? - Where's Jordan? - She didn't make it home last night. She was half passed out the last time I saw her. Hey listen. Did you by any chance see that guy, dressed like a monk last night? He was kinda looking at me and I was wondering if maybe you'd talk to your brother about him for me. You know, you really got the best looking guy at the party. Scott was into you. You know what? I'm gonna go take a shower. - She was a wild thing all right. Leland, check this. Aw, what are you doing? No pain no gain. - Man, I am not into that. - Scott the hot. - Hey, how you doin' man? - How you doin'? - What's up, D-man? - How many times, stud? - Almost went for a hat trick. Courtney was passed out in my room when I left man, she's out of control. She won't leave me alone. - What's up, good party? - Yeah, yeah, you should have been there. - Dug your sister's costume, Mike. - Scott really dug your sister. - That's funny, spare me the details okay? - What's wrong with you? - It's his sister, man. - It's not funny. - Jordan, are you all right? - Fine. I don't want to talk about it. ♪ They say in a love song ♪ - Whoa, hey. What happened to you yesterday? Were you as hungover as I was? Oh by the way, you got the best grade on the test. - Just leave me alone. - Look, Melissa, don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anyone. - Okay, let's pick it up where we left off on Monday. The orthogonality of characteristic functions-- - Hey Mike, Mike, can I talk to you? - Yeah. - It's about your sister. What about her? - Well you know, the other night at the party. She wanted to be alone with me, so I took her upstairs. - I really don't need to hear about this. - We got together, Mike. Look man, listen, everything's fine, she was into it. You know, today she's acting a little bazaar. You know how girls are, they pretend like it never happened. - Wait a minute, I think you're telling me a little bit more than I really wanna know, all right? - It's only because I need a favor man. I just want you to tell her, you know, that I really like her. And I just wanna stay friends. - Yeah, okay, I'll do that. See ya, bro. - You look familiar. Are you in my art class? - No but I should be, 'cause I love art. He's with me. - Whatever. Hey. - Such a snob and I hate her. - Oh yeah? Everyone's got a sensitive side. Even me. Like Chris, sometimes I feel sorry for my friends, like Leland sitting all alone over there. Maybe he wants to be. - No, no, that's not true. Nobody wants to be alone. Look he's depressed. He needs someone to talk to, someone like you. - But I want you. - That's all right, that's all right, we can hook up later. Come on, Courtney, where's your compassion? All right, I wasn't supposed to tell you this, but he has a major crush on you. - No way. Yeah, you want proof? I'll show you proof, okay? Hey man, Courtney wants you bad. - Yeah right, I'm serious. If it sounds like you like her, she'll do anything. If you don't ask her and look scared right now she's gonna be wrecked for life. Come on. Hi. - Hi. ♪ Welcome to hell, it's so good ♪ ♪ 'Cause if it's hell I'm in at least it's understood ♪ ♪ And I believe ♪ - So do you guys ever talk about me? - Uh, yeah, Scott does. So where ya from? - Minnesota. - Minnesota. Is your family still there? - My family broke up years ago. - How? - My dad died, and my mom got real depressed. She tried to take care of me, but, it doesn't matter I don't wanna bring you down. - No, no, no, it's okay. Really, I don't mind listening. - Really? - Yeah. - I actually haven't talked to her for about 10 years. She liked to drink. - Kellie? Kellie. - What are you doing? What are you doing? - Oh, Jordan! - Are you out of your mind, we're just hanging out! - Are you okay? - I'm fine. - Melissa you could have killed him. - Miss Connell, may I have a word with you? There's been a noticeable decline in your school work. Something bothering you? - No, I just need to try harder. - Yes, you do. Hey. - Hi. - Did I leave the wrong message on your machine? This is a pre-pinning party, it's not a grunge ball. I'm sorry, that was rude. I invited you to cheer you up. Melissa, what's wrong? Is it Scott? He told me all about it. - What? - Everybody goes a little wild their freshman year, just put it behind you. Hi Mike. Hi. Sorry I'm late. How you doing Melissa? - Great, I'm fine. - I thought you were gonna come over last night? - I fell asleep. But this is your night. What exactly does pre-pinning mean? - It means I love her with my heart and soul. - We're getting somewhat committed, some day. - 'Cause I had to fall for a hardcore romantic. Hey, Scott. - Hey guys. - What's he doing here? - We invited him weeks ago. - Hey Melissa. You look great. Have you guys met Lauren? - Hi. - How could you do this to me? Give me your car keys. - What? - I want to leave now. - Melissa, you don't have to leave. - Give me your car keys. - All right. - I'm sorry, man. - She'll get over it. - Oh, you know, I really should go talk to her. Excuse me. Sorry, Mike. Melissa, please, just give me a chance to talk to you. What is wrong? I just wanna talk! Melissa, wait, come on. Melissa! Please, just give me another chance. - You're a very lucky lady. - I don't feel lucky. - Would you like to talk with someone? Okay. - I'm scared all the time, scared of everything. - What are you scared of? - I can't concentrate. I don't eat, I don't sleep. I feel like I'm losing it. - Well what happened to make you feel this way? - It was the first week of school, and... I went to this frat party, and things got out of control. - How out of control? - I drank too much. I forgot I hadn't eaten. And then I went upstairs with this guy, and he had sex with me. - Did you say yes? - I did not say yes. - So you didn't consent? - I said, no, I didn't want to. But he wouldn't stop, he wouldn't listen to me! He ripped off my clothes. - Melissa, are you saying he raped you? - No, I knew him, I trusted him, he was my brother's friend. - Just because you knew the guy doesn't mean it wasn't rape. - I was so stupid. - Melissa, if you said no, and he did it anyway, you were raped. - I shouldn't have gone upstairs, I should have-- - All right, it sounds like you're blaming yourself and you need to talk with someone to help you though this. A friend, or your RA. Maybe even your parents. - No. They'd be so disappointed in me. Come on, Melissa, cheer up. It's Thanksgiving. - Sorry about your car. - It's okay. Wanna talk about you and Scott? - No. - I thought you'd wanna raid the refrigerator. - No. - No? You're not on one of those crazy diets are you? You've lost weight. - I'm fine. - Are you studying too hard? You look exhausted. - Yeah, kind of. Can I please be alone for awhile? - Yes. - You know that last score was a lucky shot. - You're an old man, old man. - Tell me, you score that much at school? - I get as much as I can handle. - Good, just don't get too serious about anybody 'cause girls just get in the way. I'm telling you, grades and contacts, that's all that's important in this downsizing economy-- - Dad, Dad, stop stressing, all right. I'm a lock for the dean's list. - You better be if you want to get anywhere in this world. - I know, hey, hey. - Ooh, I'll take you. - You're an old man. - Oh yeah, you think? You think? Scott stop! - Melissa? Talk to me. - I can't. - Is this about breaking up with Kevin? Are you having trouble at school? Oh, Melissa, tell me what's going on. - I don't want you to think any less of me. - How can you say that honey? Nothing, nothing could make me love you any less. - Mom. I was raped. Oh honey. - Mom, I'm so sorry. - I'm sorry. I feel like I should have been able to protect you. Do you know who did it? - Scott Baker. The boy you met the first day at the dorm. - Well, I think that she should press charges. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, mom. Are you crazy, that would make things 10 times worse. - We have to think this through, very carefully. - It's a criminal act. - Well then think like a lawyer, it's her word against his. It happened months ago, there's no way she can win. - Yes she can, in this day and age, I think she can. - Mom, you're not a criminal lawyer. There's no way that she can win. - Do you believe me, Michael? - I believe that that's the way you remember it. Mel, come on. You were totally wasted that night. - I know, I had too much to drink, it was dumb. - Still, that doesn't give anyone the right to rape her. - Why would he do that? Scott is the most popular guy in the house. We never had one complaint about him. - Why are you defending him? - Look, I know that he was drinking too. But why should he be responsible for his part in it when you're not taking any responsibility for yours? - Because he's the one that raped me, not the other way around! He ripped off my clothes, Michael. - You don't have to tell us everything. - Yes I do. - Okay. All I'm saying is I think we should just keep it in the family. - If you talk about this at school, I think you're gonna be stigmatized. It would just make things more difficult for her. - Melissa hasn't done anything that she should be ashamed of. - That's not the point. What does she have to gain, it's over, it's done. Mel, why would you wanna put yourself through the ringer? - Because I can't stand seeing his face in class. It's not fair that he can do that to me and then just go on like nothing happened. I want to stop him from ruining someone else's life. - Is this really about protecting others? Or is it about revenge? Look, man, I don't know what happened between you and my sister, but she is completely screwed up. You should have just kept your hands off of her. - Come on, Mike, so what am I to blame 'cause your sister's delusional? I mean, tell her to get some therapy. - Look man, it is completely out of my control. - Ah. - Scott, she's going to the police. - What are you talking about? Oh come on, Mike, this is totally insane. I'm supposed to go to jail because your sister got drunk and rewrote history? - If there was any doubt in your mind, you should have just stopped. - Where do you think I learned the game, huh? The trick about the dirty room. The drink tickets, jello shooters. The game, Mike, you taught me, you taught me everything. - I never pushed a girl when she said no. - Who are you kidding. - Look I'm not you, Scott. - I didn't rape her. Excuse me, excuse me. What is wrong with you? Why are you bringing to cops into this? - Because you raped me. - The hell I did. We had sex Melissa, and that's all. Now you wish we hadn't, well guess what? I wish we hadn't but I didn't rape you. - I said no. - You were drunk! Do you understand that, how the hell do you know what you said? Don't you understand you came up to my room. You laid on my bed. I thought you wanted me, I wanted you. Why are you acting like this? - Because you raped me. - I'm not gonna let you do this to me. And I swear to God, if you go through with this, you're gonna be sorry. Think about it. - Melissa, I want you to know that I believe everything that you've told me here, but it's very difficult for us to prosecute cases that are reported this late because it's hard to gather all the evidence. Were there any witnesses at all? Did you tell anyone what happened that night? - No. - Well, I can take it to the DA but I doubt they'll press charges, I think your best bet would be taking it up with the university. - But this was sexual assault, it's not an honors violation. - I understand. And I also share your frustration. But the fact is, this rapist may get away with it. It happens all the time. - You have two options. We can take this up at a disciplinary hearing at which both you and the boy you're accusing will testify in front of a panel of students and faculty. Or you can try to resolve this through mediation. Privately. - As if rape can be mediated. - I'm simply giving you options. - Is the hearing public? - No, but you can each bring some support people, and an attorney, if you wish. - And what happens if I win? - He'll probably be expelled. So think it over. It's entirely up to you. - That's all you're gonna do about this? - You know I thought that this was a great school. I've been sending checks to the alumni fund for years, why can't you keep your female students safe? - Mrs. Connell, may I remind you that this happened off campus at your son's fraternity. We will support you in whatever course you choose. But the alleged rapist is entitled to due process. His rights have to be considered, too. - I'm sorry, but don't you think that a disciplinary hearing is just a tad draconian? Talk about killing flies with a sledge hammer. - No, I think a rape calls for at least a hearing. - Scott says that from now on, the guys are gonna have to get a written waiver to kiss a girl. Is that what you want? - No, but I think getting consent before they have sex isn't too much to ask. - My psych professor says that you're setting feminism back by acting like women aren't responsible for their own sexuality. - You're psych professor needs to get his head examined. - I'm not gonna blame myself anymore. - Melissa, what did you expect when you went up to his room? - Not rape, that's for sure. - Maybe you shouldn't have had so much to drink. - Kellie, rape is rape whether a woman's drunk or not. - I just hope you don't regret this. - I just hope you're not on jury. Excuse me. Jordan, where have you been, I was worried. - Staying with this guy for a little while. Just came to get a few things. - But you're coming back, right? - What's the point of making plans? Life happens. - What happened to you? You haven't practiced your music for weeks. I haven't seen you on campus. Are you studying someplace else? - I flunked my midterms. There's no way to recover from that. Just better off dropping this semester. - Oh Jordan, I'm so sorry. - Look forget me, all right. I'm worried about you. The guys are really ticked about this whole disciplinary hearing thing. - How'd you know? - Campus net, everyone knows. Some people think you got what was coming to you. - Who's side are you on? - Yours, of course. But I live in the present now. Why stress about stuff you can't change? You believe her, don't you? - I don't know anymore. Look, she thinks she was raped. Scott doesn't think he did anything wrong. - Oh come on, Mike, my God, the way you guys live. It's all about who drinks the most, who scores the most. Your goal is to turn a no into a yes. Convince her she doesn't mean what she says. Look when a woman says no, she doesn't mean maybe. - Wait it's those maybes that are tough. They shouldn't be a crime. - Your sister didn't say, "Maybe," she said, "No". Michael, your sister needs you now more than your fraternity brothers ever will. - All right, guys, listen up. We've had some bad press around school. Greeks are politically incorrect, everybody's trying to tear us down these days. Look, I love Kappa Pi, I've been here for four years. I just hate to see us tear each other down. Look, what I'm trying to say, is be careful. All right, if a girl says no, she means no. And if there's any doubt in your mind. She means no. Got it? Yeah. - All right then guys, let's party. Scott? - Yeah. - Listen, just for tonight, will you be the designated driver? - Come on, man, get real. Trial starts in four days, I've got the biggest reason to get ripped. - Scott. You don't think she can like, prove anything do you? - You can't prove something that didn't happen. - You sure it didn't happen? - Leland, for thinking the worst or the better, I sentence you to videotaping the party. Huh? - Kellie you shouldn't go to that party alone. - Party's there every Thursday night. Most of them don't result in rape. Not that I or anything. Besides, I can read people's hidden agendas. I'm extremely insightful that way. - Oh and I'm not? - That's not what I meant. Look, Melissa, please don't take this the wrong way but you're definitely getting paranoid. - I'm not paranoid. - Come on, Melissa, even a non psychology major could tell that you're extremely depressed. - I just don't like to go to parties, that's all. - That's just more denial. Look. I'm not gonna leave until I know that you'll be all right here alone. - Just go, I'm fine. - Okay. Okay. Beep me, if you need to. - Hello. - Stop writing about me in the bathrooms. - I'm not the one who's writing about you. - That's a lie! A lie, my life is being ruined! Good! - If you don't drop this thing, I'll-- - You'll what? Rape me again? - I did not rape you, you bitch. I swear to God, if you don't shut up, I'll sue. Or worse. - Tonight's the night. Upstairs in my room, three tattoos and three piercings. Ladies choice. - I'm not into self mutilation. Thanks. - Piercing doesn't have to be painful. - Hi. - Hi. This one's not alcoholic, right? - Of course. It's 90 % fruit juice. Hey stud. - Not bad, huh? - Kellie, Kellie's trashed. - See ya later. - You okay? - She's fine, thanks anyway. - You know where you are? Do you wanna be here? - It's not your problem, Michael. - Come on, bro. Come on, let's go. Whoa, whoa. ♪ With ashes on the ground ♪ ♪ I see this dream ♪ ♪ And I know my loss ♪ ♪ Never gonna be the same ♪ - My head. How did I get here? - You don't remember? - Not much.

Anything could have happened. - No. No, it couldn't, you don't do anything drunk that you wouldn't do sober, I read that somewhere. I'm almost positive. Nothing like that could ever happen to me. - But Melissa. - The hearing's still two days away, it's not too late to call it off. - And let a jerk like that get to you? - Well, what if it's a preview of the rest of my life? Either I'll be remembered as a lying bitch, or the girl who got drunk and stupid and raped. - How about the girl who stood up and fought back? - What if I lose? - Well, you won't be any worse off than you are now. - It's already worse. This could follow me for the rest of my life. - Yeah, it could. - Jordan. - What are you doing here? Don't they feed you for free at the dorm? - I saw you. You work here now? - Yeah. I need some time to get my head together before I re-enroll. - We were roommates. I thought I knew you. - I don't care what you think. - Jordan, what happened at that party? - What party? - The first one, everything changed for you after. - Nothing changed, okay. I discovered my roots. I like to party. I like to have fun. What's so bad about doing what everybody else is doing? - What about your music? - Oh yeah right. Yeah, I was really gonna play in a world class orchestra, right? Look, I'm just a hick on a scholarship, okay? I never even had a boyfriend before I came here. What the hell did I really know about life? - Go over there and show her who's boss. - Did you enjoy your little stay in the library today? - Or at a hotel? Kappa Pi. Kappa Pi. - Oh, you dropped your books. - That was clumsy. - Leave me alone. - You haven't been drinking have you? - I'm not scared of you. Excuse me, those frat guys over there are bothering me. What boys? - Hey. Who are you chasing? - Someone just like me. But I'm through running. - Now just stay calm and tell the truth. - But don't be afraid to be emotional because they need to know what you've gone through. - Mom, Dad, I know you want to protect me. But I have to go through this. I'll be okay. - All right. - Hi, Mark. - Dad, that's Scott's father. - Did you know that Scott Baker is Mark Baker's son? - No, I didn't. - Edward Connell's daughter is making these accusations against you? - What's the difference? - Exactly, you hold your head up high. It's her word against yours. You sure there's no one else who could make these accusations? - Yeah, I'm sure Dad, there's, no, there's no one. - All right. Each of you will have an opportunity to tell what happened as you remember. Remember, you are under oath. Our panel will then ask you some questions. Miss Connell? - Melissa, at what time did you arrive at the party that night? - Around 8:00. - Did you have anything alcoholic to drink before you went to the party? - No. - How much alcohol did you consume at the party? - I don't remember, a lot. It hit me fast because I hadn't eaten much all day. - Yeah, yeah I was buzzed. We had pre-partied a little bit and I had a couple of shots. - Did you force her to drink? - Absolutely not. But in all fairness, I didn't exactly try to talk her out of it either. - Is this picture an accurate representation of Melissa at the party that evening? - Well, pictures don't lie, do they? - When he led you up to his room what did you expect to happen? - I thought he'd let me lie down for awhile, until he found my friend for me. - I always let the girl make the first move. I mean, no way would I push her into anything. - Did anyone see your ripped shirt? I threw it out. - If I had been ripping clothes off, someone would have noticed, right? - Did you in anyway coerce her to have sex? - I told you, she's the one who started, I swear on my honor. - I said no, but he pinned me down, and ripped off my clothes. I was crying. But it didn't matter. I was like, a thing to him. - I didn't rape her. I would never force myself upon anyone. I mean, to me sex is private and special and it only makes sense when you care about someone. I care about Melissa. I thought I really knew her that's why I'm so shocked that this is happening to me. You know what, I would like to kiss someone without being afraid that they're gonna cry rape. And Melissa has taken that away from me. I don't think I'll ever completely trust a woman again. And if you ask me, there are two victims here. - The panel will now retire to deliberate in private. We should have answer for you later this afternoon. - May I say one more thing? I care about Melissa. I hope she gets the help she needs. Thank you, Mr. Baker. You may all wait outside. - Edward. - Be back in a minute. - Mark. You remember Denise? - Yeah of course, still beautiful. - Hi Mark. I'm gonna check on Melissa. - Well you haven't changed a bit. Who would have thought we'd end up meeting again like this, huh? - Yeah. - You know, back when you and I pledged, those were the days, right? - Yeah, those were the days. - Course everything's different now. - Yes, they are. - Back when you and I ran the house. Things were great. None of this politically incorrect bull, we could just be who we were. Everybody new the rules, no blame. No excuses, no misunderstandings. - I know that's what we believed. But it was never really quite that simple, was it? - I hope someday we can put this behind us. - I don't think that would be possible, Mark. - Don't take that self-righteous tone with me, Ed, Scott did not do anything that you and I didn't do. - Speak for yourself. - My son deserves an apology. - Your son? You better just pray that your son never gets what he deserves. He's gonna get away with it. You don't know that. I could tell, didn't you hear them in there? - You can't predict what a jury will decide. And if you don't get justice here, there are other-- - There is no justice in cases like these. It's his word against mine. He assaults me and gets the benefit of the doubt, and I'm the one on trial. - I'm sorry, Melissa. - It's not you that I'm mad at. - And is the decision unanimous? - By majority vote, this panel finds Scott Baker not guilty. - Hey, congratulations. - Excuse me. - Okay, first we'll see about getting you a transfer to another college. - If he drives me out of here, he wins all over again. - He didn't win, Melissa. It's just two people didn't agree, that's all. I'll call our attorney as soon as we get home. - I don't wanna go through this again. - Honey, you don't understand. A civil court not under the influence of the university could see things completely differently. - Dad, it's over. I lost. I wanna move past this. - But Judge Bennett went to school with your mother I'm sure that-- - Ed, she knows what she wants and I think we have to respect that. Let's go. - Bye. - Love you. See you soon. Love you. - I'll move out of the house next week, getting an apartment. I can't live there after what happened to you. - You don't have to do that. - I know. Mel, I am so sorry that I wasn't there for you when you needed me. - All right, they're five bucks a piece, and I can make you a five by seven for 10. You sent to your grandparents for Christmas or Hanukkah. The ones before strip poker started, naturally, right? Hey, Mikey. I got some pictures for the casino night if you wanna see 'em. Holly ordered a dozen. - Leland we're moving in together. I don't need duplicates anymore. Leland. Do you save the pictures that nobody buys? - Yeah, for a couple of months in case some one changes their mind, why? - Do you have the ones from the costume kickoff party? - Yeah, yeah, I think they're upstairs. - Excellent. There. Oh my God. Look. - Hey, Mike. Listen man, I'm sorry about your-- - Get up, get up! Get up, son of bitch! Oh God, my nose. - Come on get up! Get up! - What's going on in here? - You raped her, you son of a bitch. - You're just a sore loser, Connell! - You raped her, just say it. - You're just as mental as your sister. - You're scum you know that. - I gave your sister exactly what she wanted man. She begged for it. - Oh God, let me go, come on! No let me go. - All right, relax. - Brothers, bro, let me go. Let me go. I hope you wind up in jail. You find out exactly what rape is like first hand! Let's go talk it over. - Guys wanna know you're deactivating. The pledges, they want you to stay. - No, I was gonna move in with Holly at the end of the semester anyway. I might as well get a place for us now. - Look, if you go, things'll never change around here. - Like they'd change if I stay? - You were making people think, Michael. Look a lot of us, we're behind you. - Silent majority, huh? - There's a lot more of us than you think. Look, Dylan and Nick, they wanna throw you a going away party this weekend. - You mean Scott wants to throw me off the roof? - Hey, you're still a brother. - Ah. - All right, we had a lot of good times here. What do you say? One more before you go. It'll mean a lot to the guys. - Why not? - All right. You can reopen the case, maybe sue him in civil court. I just wanna get on with my life. I came here for an education Michael. I can't do that with lawyers hanging over my head. - Yeah, but if Mike found that picture, maybe there's more, in the fraternity vault? - Just say the word and they're yours. - I don't wanna see 'em. I don't want to live in the past. I don't wanna be mad all the time. Look if Scott just stays out of my face, I'll stay out of his. - How many were able to multiply the matrices? Miss Connell? - The way I understand it, the problem is-- - I've got it. You see the first terms are simple. - It's my turn, Baker, so shut up. I'm talking. The problem is resolved best by observing that these are unitary matrices. Then they're equal to their own inverses. - That's correct, Miss Connell. - It's me. - What do you want? - You said you wanted to see me? On the mirror. - You wrote those messages? - I wanted you to know that you weren't alone. - Why didn't you come forward before? - Well at first I really didn't know that it happened. When Scott told me we had sex, I just thought it was okay. You know, I did have a crush on him. - Yeah, I thought you two had a relationship together. - Well I convinced myself we did. But then I realized that I was unconscious anytime he took advantage of me. How could I let him use me like that, you know? And pretend that it wasn't happening. I mean, I must be the most dumbest, stupidest, neediest person in this world. - Don't blame yourself. - Come on Michael, take one more shot for the road. Kappa Pi, come on. - Kappa Pi! All right, come on, man, that's it. I wanna save a few brains cells when I leave this place. - This is your last stand as Kappa Pi. Now shut up and suck it up! - Come on man, that's it. I gotta go see Holly guys. Come on. - You'll get there. - Guys, don't you think maybe-- - Leland. Shut up. - Move bro. It's all right, I can take it. - Yeah, Mikey can take it. Mike's a real man. - That's right, Mikey, another buzz bomb for Mikey! - Buzz bomb for Mikey. - Drink, drink, drink, drink-- - Hold on ah! Yeah Mikey! - He always calls me when he's late. - Don't worry, he'll be here. - Oh my God, Michael. Go get help. What's happening? - Is he gonna be all right? - He's stabilized. He could have died from alcohol poisoning. In fact, I don't know how he stayed conscious long enough to consume that much alcohol. - His brothers helped him out. - You can go in now. - Oh Michael. - I thought you were dead. - Can't get rid of me that easy. - This never would have happened if you hadn't stood up for me. - Hey. I wouldn't have done it any other way. - There's something I would have done differently. Remember what you said about those outtakes? In the fraternity house? - Michael. Hey look, I'm really sorry, things got way out of hand. - It's all right, we all get out of hand every once in awhile. - I mean it, Michael. It was wrong. Lately I've been thinking about leaving too. Soon as I can find a place I can afford. - Strong move, man. - Yeah. - Yeah. Listen, there's something really important I want to talk to you about. I don't even know what's on these. - We use these for house memories in the video yearbook. - Thank you, both of you. - Do me a favor, all right, don't hurt anyone who doesn't deserve to be hurt. - I won't. Now get out of here so I can get to work. - Bye. - I know, I'm always putting others first. Listen, I'll call you the first free minute I get. I swear. Okay, bye bye. I love you. - I saw some tape of the costume kick off party. - What's it to me? - You were in it, this guy was carrying you upstairs. You were totally unconscious. - Melissa, it's water under the bridge. Why can't you just let me be? - Fine I'll never bother you about this again. But if you decide you wanna talk, I'm around. - Nothing to talk about. - Your violin's in your room. If you ever want it back. - So, all set for 12:00 Saturday? - Almost. But I have to talk to Scott first. - This is a joke, right? - Remember when this started and you said I was after revenge? Yeah? - I need to know that I'm not. That I'm doing this because there's no other way. - He deserves it, Melissa. - But I need to look him in his eyes. If he gets it. If he really changed, I have to let him walk. - Melissa, you are being way too fair. - I'm not doing it for him. I'm doing it for me. Every time I turn a corner, I hear his footsteps. I need to know I'll be okay. Scott. Scott, stop. - What do you want from me, Melissa, huh? You're gonna charge me with rape again? - I'm giving you one last chance to admit it. - I did not rape you. - Fine, I gave you your chance. - Or what? I'm talking to you! - Was that guy bothering you? - No, I'm fine. You sure? - I know how to handle it now. Okay. Get a loud of this, I just a call from. - That was a good game. - Shut up and watch. - To me, sex is private and special. You're wearing beer goggles at a quarter to four? And the only hag left is a butt ugly beast. I respect women, maybe too much. - You're talkin' total beast? - Dirty. Kind of put women on a pedestal. Maybe, if face and bod average too. - Wrong, she's a minus five. I would never force myself upon anyone. - But a manly man might still make his move. How? By turning off the lights. Why? 'Cause they're all the same in the dark. Kappa Pi. - And it only makes sense when you care about someone. Man, it was like doing it with a pig. Man did she have a fat ass. - Thanks. - But I thought you loved her, liked her, something? - Think I, why would I, I did until she started making plans for spring break. Fat ass. What do you think I am? You're talkin' about love. Fat, that's all I gotta say. I always let the girl make the first move. - Total beast. - Dirty. She's the one who started it, I swear on my honor. She wants to leave. - Want me to turn it off? - Nothing happened like Melissa said. I didn't rip her shirt. Are you 100 % certain? - I'd stake my life on it. - I took this picture at the kickoff costume party. I was shooting the couple, but I blew it up to show Melissa Connell. She's trying to get away without being seen. - Pictures don't lie, do they? Turn it off. Pictures don't lie, do they? I said turn it off! She didn't even know she was in frame. She's trying to get away without being seen. - Pictures don't lie, do they? I haven't done anything the rest of you guys haven't done. And I care about Melissa. I thought I really knew her, that's why I'm so shocked that this is happening to me. - I don't know what to say. - They're revoking the Kappa Pi charter. - 'Cause of Scott? - 'Cause the drinking on video, it's against university rules. - But everyone does it. - Not on camera. - So I'll see ya next semester, roomie? - Yeah. Oh Melissa, I'm so sorry I made things hard for you. - It's over, nevermind. - Okay. - Bye. - Came back for this. Can't believe I left it here. - I was gonna hold it for you. - Saw your show. - Do you wanna talk about it? - You know what happened to me. - Jordan, I know. - I thought if I pretended that it was no big deal it would just go away. But it didn't. What went away was me. I forgot who I was and why I came here. I lost my scholarship. I lost everything. - You can get it back. - I'm gonna reapply for the spring semester. Maybe I'll qualify for student aid. - Good. Because I wouldn't want to get used to a new roommate. - Do you need a ride? - Thanks. Meet ya downstairs. - Okay.
