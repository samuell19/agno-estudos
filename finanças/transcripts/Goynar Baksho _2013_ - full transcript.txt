FF LF The jewellery box lay safe and sound deep inside the chest Who knew that it would tumble out & stir a hornet's nest? Ta ra rum pum pum pum para! In the storm it went asunder! And lo! Behold! There tumbled out some very strange events ! From the jewellery box... ...that all along lay safe inside the chest! But what is there in the box? Oh no! Oh no! Best not to know! Just let the matter rest That box is such a pest! The jewellery box that all along lay safe inside the chest! If it must be told, a chain of gold... ...a 100 grams or more... ...friends & foes and loves & woes... ...& secret tales of yore... ... & rugs in dreams... ...that turn to trees never seen before! In the box there is a story! In the box there is a story... ...bursting to be free! So the magic cat swings wide its tail, runs up the magic tree! The tail is quite a rocker! The old crone grabs her hookah! In a snap, she starts a stream before you can count to three! The magic cat swings wide its tail up in the magic tree But that's not all, three vessels tall come floating down the stream Their sails are all aflutter, but what is this we have here! The sails have turned to sarees! The sails have turned to sarees... ...stairs come down in a flurry! Pots and pails and cats with tails come hurtling with a clatter! Whatever is the matter? If a sail can be a saree, why not a tail a rose? & bloom and turn to letters lost, made up of loves and woes Lost letters full of woes.... Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear! There goes the bell, you hear? What tumbled out must tumble in, scurrying back in fear! Is the box just full of jewels? So all these things we've all been seeing, nothing is for real? Is the box just full of jewels? Oh no! Oh no! Best not to know, just let the matter rest That box of yarns with twists & turns were best inside the chest! That box is such a pest! The box had originally belonged to my Pishi-thakuma... ... that is, my father's aunt. Rasmoni! She'd got it as part of her dowry Rasmoni had been married at the age of 11 By 12 she was a widow She never went back to her in-laws' home again No! No! Don't cut my hair! They say she had been a great beauty in her time And vain too! Her brothers had spoilt her... ...to make up for her early widowhood Rasmoni! Rasu! Come down, your food's been served! C-o-m-i-n-g! Hmph! Food's been served! Just hear them! As though they've laid out a feast! All they'll serve me is that awful widows' fare! Ghastly vegetarian stuff! I'm coming! ...coconut pattern 1 pair... ... so that's that... ... ruby studded - 1 pair... So, 28 pairs of bangles... ...19 pairs of earrings... One can't be too careful! They're all waiting like vultures to get their filthy hands on my box! She was said to have developed a terrible temper in her old age Her brothers' wives were terrified of her moods! How I came to own her box of jewels... ...is a long story We'd have to go back to 1949, 2 years after India's Independence By then Bengal had been divided up between India and Pakistan My grandparents had left their ancestral home in Faridpur... ...to come & live in West Bengal Soon after, my mother arrived here as a bride Sister look ! A real brick house! A mansion! The matchmaker was right! You've married royalty! Rasu! Rasmoni! Chandan and his bride have come for your blessings Ugh! That awful cat again! Get rid of it someone! Unlucky creature! Chandan! Too big for your boots after marriage, huh? Chase the brute away at once! It's gone... Good! Your husband's aunt. Go touch her feet, dear Hey Chandu! The girl's family is penniless I believe? There! You're a jackass, Chandu! Must've been your mother who made the match? No wonder! She too, is from this side of the border! Her own folk are as poor as field mice! What're you standing for? Need an invitation to sit? Now then, let's see your face! Hmm! Natural or make-up? Now for your hair! Nothing to write home about! Before I became a widow, my hair was long enough to sit on! Chandu... ...fetch that photograph! Taken when I was eleven... ...by a British lady photographer Alright...now for the actual... Yes! Yes! I know! I suppose you're expecting some jewellery from me? No, no! Stop acting coy! Too heavy! Here you are! Ever seen the likes of these at your father's? These are Burmese rubies! Belonged to my grandma! Keep them carefully, understand? Now off with you! Wasted enough time! Ruby studded bangles - cancelled! Just look at that! Got him tied to her apron strings already! Shameless hussy! Saw that? Measly gold chain for me & Burmese rubies for her! Let it go... I put up lights wherever you asked! I must at least cover costs, Sir! -Shut up you swine! You and your false accounts! -No point shouting, Sir Clear my dues & I'll leave. - Get out! That's all you'll get! Bring it here! Take this & get lost! If I'd known I'd get a bed in lieu of payment, Sir... ...I wouldn't have accepted the contract! - Oh go on ! Don't flaunt contracts! Have you ever seen a piece like this in your life ? A genuine antique! Real Burma teak! Know what that means? The British hunt for pieces like this nowadays! So I have to go hunting for the British now? They left 2 years ago, Sir. For good! Where do I find them? Silence, you ill-mannered oaf! Rambilas! Rambilas! -Sir? Listen! That antique carpet in the hall... - The big one? Fetch it! - Yes Sir! Go! Useless bunch! Give this swine the damned carpet... ...& throw him out on his ear! Yes! Yes! Give it all away! All our land is in Pakistan now, with no one to look after it! Why keep anything here either? So many creditors still waiting in line! Watch out for potholes! Careful! Don't scratch it! - It's real Burma teak! - Oh no! Gone! What's the din about? Who passes? A bed, brother! A bed? All by itself! No brother... ...a carpet accompanies it! I see! Ask them to pass quietly! Lost my catch because of them! Nuisance! So... ...now you know all! Get your husband in hand while there's still time... ...make a man out of him! Let go, & he'll spend the rest of his days lazing! M-m-me? Who else? You're still a novelty for him; so he'll heed your words But he's s-so much older than me! Supposing he g-gets angry? Stop stammering! What're you scared of? Know how much older than me your father-in-law is? At least 20 years! So? Mustn't give so much importance to men's moods! In any case... ...better an angry husband than a poor one! Your t-tea! How well you p-play! So you like music? -Yes Can you sing? N-no Unfortunate! Anyway... get me my kurta, will you? Will you be going out? Can anyone go out in this? Where's the silk one? You go out almost every evening... ...w-w-where do you go? Why? Do I have to answer to you? No, no! Of course not! I was just... Hm! Any more questions? Only one... ...wh-who provides for me here? I m-mean... ...who bears the h-h-ousehold expenses? I haven't the faintest idea! You are being provided for, aren't you? Indeed! Look... ...it's not me or my brother! I'm sure you know that! And it's not my father either Men in our family haven't worked for generations We're landlords. Landed gentry. Understood? Oh! Then we must be having a lot of l-l-land, right? Of course! I mean, I'm sure we do... Where? What do you mean? I'd...I'd love to see it... Oh dear! Are you a wife? Or an assessing officer! It's all in Pakistan. How do I show it to you? Any more queries? - N-n-no... Thank heaven! Demanding to see land! The absurdity of it! See you! EF There! Your kite's gone! Hello! Remember me? No, you don't! I'm Reba! Dressed you up for the wedding, remember? Our fathers-in-law are cousins I remember now So how are you? Made friends with your husband yet? Why haven't you come to visit us since? Just listen to her! Don't you know anything? There's a court case on! Our families are fighting a case... ...over the possession of this house! It's all right to socialise at weddings and festivals... ...but on a day-to-day basis, we're supposed to be enemies! Got that? What a sweet child! Your son? Good heavens, no! My mother-in-law would have a fit if she heard you! This is Benu... ...short for Banwarilaal! That's his mother there - Etwaari! Yes ma'am? Take him away! Such a whiner! Come baby. Don't you know her? Her husband is your father-in-law's servant! Rambilas...? You're still new here... ...you'll get to know everyone soon enough! You know... ...they say the men in your family... ...killed Benu's grandfather in a fit of rage! So, to atone for their sin... ...they've looked after his family since then! What? M-m-murder! Who knows? It was all such along time ago! But there was no police case or anything! Said he fell down the stairs & broke his neck! It was...something to do with your husband's aunt... ...the old lady with the box of jewels! Quick! Come and see something! Come! Your father-in-law! & there's mine! Guess where they've been? Where? - At court! To fight the case! They travel together because it's cheaper! They can share the carriage fare! Once they reach the court, they go their separate ways... ...& fight each other over the house! Then they come back together gossiping merrily... ...& chewing betel! P-i-ishima - Pishima! Don't worry, I'm dead alright! - Oh my God! Wait! No need to go blabbing to them at once! They'll come rushing up the moment they hear, the vultures! I know what's on your mind! Good riddance, you'll all be saying! Now you'll come & occupy my rooms... ...& divide up my jewellery! But I'll have none of that, you hear? Tell that jackass husband of yours... ...that he'd better not think of living up here! Else he'll die before the week's out! Don't gape like an idiot! Hurry up! Untie the keys from my saree! Come here! Don't worry, I won't wring your neck! Not yet! Untie the keys! Idiot! Can a ghost have real keys on her? Take them from my corpse! Done? Now go to the other room Go! Pricked your foot? Serves you right! Rushing up with that mirror to see if I am good & dead! There's a chest near the window Take the big iron key from the ring... ...the big one! Now unlock the chest! Hurry up! Look underneath the woollens ... ...you'll find a wooden box wrapped in a shawl! Yes! Now lock the chest and fetch the box! Hurry! Hurry! This...? Yes! That's the one they're after, the vultures! Now listen carefully! Hide the box so that not a soul will know! Think I'm gifting it to you? Bullshit! Just making sure they don't grab my precious jewellery! Open it! There's over 5000 grams of gold! A 100 gram g-g-old chain... I'm warning you! Not a speck of gold must be missing! If you ever so much as try on a single piece... ...I'll make you a widow by wringing your husband's neck... ...and sucking his life blood dry! That'll end your hopes of ever wearing jewellery again! Got that, you moron? -Y-yes... Now hurry! Tie my bunch of keys back! No one must suspect that they'd been taken! Quick! I hear footsteps! Goodness! Is she woman or a horse? Galloping off like... Wait! What was that bulge under her saree? What's this? Lata! Where are you? Lata- Lata! Who? Who? Who? What? What? Why are you lying in the dark? What's the matter? Nothing...I... I had a headache. So... Well, listen... ...there's some bad news! W-w-what? Pishima... ...our aunt who lived upstairs... ...she's kicked the bucket What! - I mean... ...she's died. Passed away! Everyone's upstairs. We should go too... Unfavourable planetary position? Yes sir! At that time Saturn was in the ... Found the box? Hunt! Hunt! The jewellery box! I'm trying to find it... Oh, there you are at last! Come on, pay your last respects. What's there to cry so much about? Oh my God! A saree! Not there? - What do you mean? - Why not? Who's that? Nothing here, Sir! Jewellery box! Ha! Nothing at all! Shut up you swine! Look again Yes! Yes! Keep searching! Does he think we've stolen it? - Calm down! Waste of time! - But Father.. Useless lot! Suspecting our sons' wives too? This is too much! Actually Father, I was saying... No use searching this room! I know who's taken it! Wait! Wait! What's that? I'll check... Nothing here! Take the key What do you think you're doing? Trashing the whole house! Don't worry I know who's taken the box even if no one else does! I'll show them! Absolutely useless! Move, I'll take a look... Don't just stand there! Lift the damn lid! I'm lifting it! Don't touch this chest! It's possessed I tell you! Leave it alone Pishima must have hidden her box somewhere Leave it alone? Nonsense! Useless idiots! I will not let it go Here you! Go and call the police at once! My hands... What're you whining for? Come on! Sir, I don't know anything Sir! Let me go Sir! Please! Master! It's not my fault Master! I swear to you... Sir, let my husband go! He's innocent! Don't spare them! A couple of blows and it will all come pouring out! Criminals in the house! Unbelievable! Where have you hidden it? M-m-eaning...? Hope you haven't hawked the jewellery already! Why are you saying this? Don't act dumb! Who else would steal them? Ever seen so much gold in your life? Are you saying that because I'm poor? You're a dangerous one! Wouldn't be surprised if you poisoned the old crone yourself! Anyway, now that you have stolen the jewellery, I want half the booty All of 2500 grams! Got that? I haven't told anyone about you... ...& I don't intend to! If you listen to me, that is! Or else I'll tell the cops that... ...I saw you run down the stairs with the box... The cook is also a witness! You'll be charged with theft and murder... ...handcuffed & dragged to jail! What're you looking at ? Now what ? Why have you turned so pale? Scared... That takes care of her! This is the strangest case I have ever seen! Her paralysis is restricted to the tongue! Just the tongue! Amazing! What on earth is the matter? - What is it, child? What are you saying, sister-in-law ? It's no use, I tell you! It's impossible for her to say anything! I've told you... ...speech is severely impaired! But a sudden recovery may be possible Since there are no signs of any physical cause... ...it must be the result of severe mental shock No, no, I think she wants to say something If she can't speak, let her write it Here, take this - Write it down! J... My God! Paralysis has just now spread to the hand as well! Meaning? No sensation there either! But she tried to write something! 'J!' Mmm! Smells delicious! What're you cooking? Shuntki? (dried fish) M-m-mutton Liar! It's Shuntki for sure! I can tell from the smell! We d-d-don't eat Shuntki! We d-d-don't eat Shuntki! Think you're royalty, huh? Why don't you eat it? But of course! You come from a poor family from this side of the border! They used to make delicious shuntki in our Faridpur home! With onion and garlic... ...& fiery chillies! It's been so long! Can't even remember the taste! What're you cooking it with? Garlic and chillies? Mmm! What an aroma! Will you taste some? I m-e-ean if you're able... Want some? Ass!

Why shouldn't I do what I did to that bitch? She'd have sold my jewellery like a shot! I know her kind! You haven't salted the mutton. - Really? I thought I had... Enjoy it! Enjoy all the fish and meat you can... ...while there's still time! You have only another couple of months! What do you m-mean? You're going to be a widow very soon W-what are you saying Pishima! Why should that happen ? And why not? Pleased as punch because of a doting husband! Now you'll see! Why are you c-cursing me Pishima? What have I d-done? What sin have I committed? And what sin had I committed? Tell me! Are you pregnant? No...I don't know If you are, your child will die too! Don't you dare sleep with your husband! Sleep separately. Got that, shameless hussy? No salt in the mutton. Salt it! Salt it! - Call this cooking? - What's wrong? Full of salt! Is there any milk? What were you doing? Sleeping? Serves you right! So proud of your culinary skills! What happened to you today? The mutton was inedible! You're usually a good cook... ...yesterday's food was fine But...what's wrong with you? Are you sick or what? Listen! Do you believe in g-g-ghosts? Hmm... ...can't say for sure Why? Have you seen any? Yes Oh God! No! What's the matter? Please! Let go! I must sleep separately! Over there...on the floor Are you mad?

Help me God! Oh God! God! God! God! God! God! God! Hey there! Idiot! I'm here! How does it feel? How does what feel? Don't act coy! Do I have to spell it out? What you do with that jackass at night! Pishima please! My! Aren't we bashful! What's wrong in asking? Married at 11, widowed by 12! By the time my body awoke... ...I was living a barren life with my head shaved... ...eating vegetarian fare and fasting! What would you know? Tell me, how does it feel? Good. Stupid bitch! Everyone knows that! Give me some details, woman! Pishima please! So complacent! If I hadn't been a child widow... ...I too would have made a very loving wife! But he was already middle-aged when he married me... ...& consumptive on top of that! Died before you could say hoot! And if he were alive? Ah then! I would have him tied to my apron strings... ...wouldn't have let him out of my sight! Would have cooked & cleaned... ...& cared for him! Come on, girl! Tell me! Bitch!

Any news of Rasmoni's box? Nothing... ...seems to have vanished magically! The cops couldn't get anything out of those two idiots... ...so they let them go! The date for the hearing is close Do you have money for the trial? Or have you decided to give us the house? You're living in a fool's paradise! Not that easy, brother! I'll raise the money all right! Really? I'm selling some property in Pakistan. It's almost done Check! Before eyeing the house... ... you'd better save your rook! Trying to scare me off!

The sarees from the shop... ...were not really stolen, were they? You... know...? Who took them? K-k-amala? Who told you about Kamala? Is that important? Why are you acting so coy? If you l-l-ove her, then maybe you should... ...marry her & bring her home! I'll give you your f-f-reedom & go away! What are you saying! How can you compare yourself with... No question of marriage! Besides... ...I've hardly visited her since you came! In fact... ...never! Listen! You gave Kamala some sarees, fine! If you wish, give her more! But do it with your head held high! Aren't you a l-i-ion among men? Why should you have to hide anything for fear of me? I didn't give her anything, believe me! She just came one day... ...& said "I'm taking these!" I couldn't say no... You do see? Point is, can we get them back? What! Take them back? What kind of person would that make you? Besides... ...you did love her once! If you ever feel like seeing her... ...you might, you know! It's human nature! Then do so... ...but never hide it from me! Promise ? You... ...you don't despise me Lata? Why? Because you loved someone else? Silly! As though love can be c-c-ontrolled! I don't want anyone but you Lata! No one but you! No one! Not any one! Rasmoni Saree Stores! What a name! After our cousin Rasmoni! Such devotion! Who knows... ...maybe it was Chandan's wife who stole the box! I forget her name...? Somlata. But Mother, she's a very good girl! Oh come on! Good girl? Or good businesswoman? Come Puni... ...let's take a look at your cousin's shop! Come - Oh dear! My Aunt from the other side! With her daughter... Puni! If she asks for credit now...? Oh! Aunt! So happy to see you! Welcome! Welcome! Do sit! Sit Puni! Yes, sit down! Let me send for some s-s-weets? Why bother? - Why not? So then Puni... ...when did you come from Calcutta? Didn't see you at the terrace...? Terrace? In her condition? She's due any day! We've come to buy a saree for the expecting mother! B-b-uy! What do you mean? You are family! So Puni... ...what would you like to see? Japanese georgette! Have any? It's high fashion in Calcutta! Are you mad? Georgette! Here? This is not Calcutta! Let me show you some silks! From Bishnupur! Just take a look! Absolutely genuine! See, Aunt? Indigenous from Bengal! Why not a South Indian silk then? A Kanjivaram! What's that? - You wouldn't know! D'you have any? Kanjivaram? No, I'm sorry. Ours is a small outfit... ...we don't stock stuff like Georgettes or K-a-anjivarams So get them from Calcutta! The shops in Hogg Market bring sarees from all over India! Bombay! Madras! Bangalore! Mysore! You should see those shops in Calcutta! Wait Puni! Want to see a Dhaka saree? Design all over! From Benaras! Balasore! (Sarees from all over Bengal) Something in the range of red? Why not? Sunset cloud! (Different colours) Ridiculous! - Don't like any? That's enough! Brought the whole shop down for her! Listen! - No, let me talk! A chit like her! Crawling only the other day! Flaunting Calcutta here! Cousin... - No, no! She talks too big! Calcutta! Bombay! Madras! Hmph! Calcutta... Bombay...Madras Kanchipuram! Mysore! Bangalore! Pishima...? Here - Kanchipuram! Mysore! Bangalore! Sambalpur! Jaipur! Cuttack! Baroda! It was a long tour... ...but I managed to see everything! We must get new stock! - But... ...such distant places! Distant? Fine, sit back & relax! Let the shop go to the dogs! But who will travel that far? Why? What's that jackass there for? Your husband! Can't bear to part with him for a second, can you? Shameless hussy! Always wanting to cuddle! I've only made threats so far,... ...but when I really make you a widow... ...you'll know what's what! Shameless, low-born bitch! Please Pishima! Stop cursing & think about expenses! Don't act coy now! We both know that my box is there to fall back on... ...but before that, I want to check the accounts! 72 sarees were sold in the last two months I've been counting! What happened to that money? Show me the book! Go on! Don't bother getting up. Just push it this way! Cost of tiffin for the salesmen... ...30 rupees! In one month! What do you feed them? Gold? You think Pishima is illiterate, what will she know of accounts? You can hoodwink her? More fool you! I learnt math formulae in my childhood ... ...just hearing the Pundit teach my brothers! Don't ever think you can fool me! You're being very generous with your jewellery... ...but what if he gets ch-e-eated when abroad? I've been cheated all my life anyway! Husband died before I got to know him... ...the government cheated us of our home & our land! So what's new? Rather, see if you can... ...make a man out of that jackass! Pishima! Pishima, you... Damn! The English have left India, but their clothes haven't! Suddenly, I have to leave for Bombay! Out of the blue! Have I ever travelled that far? Leaving Faridpur was bad enough! Let me see? And what about me? I'll have to run the shop all by myself after you've left! Why? Birenbabu, Shajahan, they'll all be here! You're going away for so long... ...won't you m-m-miss me? Chandan! Are you done? Coming, Father! Won't you miss me at all? Don't start all this now! I'm late already! The carriage is here... Father's calling me... Where's my stick now! So much rush! Listen! Rambilas will come up. Give him my luggage See you... - It's getting late! Coming, Father! Salaam, Sir! Haven't seen you in a long time! Come & bless my poor shop with your presence... Not today. I'm in a bit of a hurry! Where are you off to? Don't get me started! My brother's gone to buy new stock The shop is my responsibility now! How can a woman handle business all by herself? You can't farm with a donkey, can you? See you... - Ok Whatever I fail to supervise... Ah! Soumen Babu! Welcome! Welcome! I don't see Mrs. Mitra...? I've sent her home. To eat! She doesn't even get time for meals! What do you want? I've brought my brother-in-law along. His daughter's getting married... ...told him the stock of bridal sarees here is better even than Calcutta! He's shopping for her trousseau! Show him some festive sarees... ...from Dhaka, Benaras, Balasore and so on... Sure! I'll do it. These are from Benaras! Sir...those are from Balasore! Oh, right. Balasore! Wait, I'll show you Benarasis as well... Here you are! Benarasi! Lovely colour! - Ah! Yes... ...what's it called? Peacock blue! That's a Midnight blue, Sir from Dhaka! It's the same thing! Peacock blue or Midnight! Yes, Midnight blue! It'll look very nice on Minu... ...don't you think? Let me see? Nice! How much? Probably Rs.45 Just check the ticket please, Sir! A slight mistake, Biren babu. Not 45... ...but 145! Just a difference of 1... ...otherwise correct! But Sir...? Isn't that a bit steep? Biren babu, would you please check again? Come now, Sir! Surely I know the prices in my own shop? No need to ask employees! This store is very reliable though! I've been shopping here a long time But the prices are fixed, my friend; no bargaining allowed! Now the decision is yours! What decision? It's his daughter's wedding after all! Biren babu, pack this. Here - Your bill... ...your change Drop in again! Of course! Give me the rest of the sarees - Let me correct the prices! You've been working for so long... ...still haven't learnt to price your goods! Heard your multi-talented brother-in-law was at the shop today? You've had it now! Actually he doesn't have much work at present, so... Hmph! An idle mind is the devil's workshop! Why can't he just go fishing like he used to? I'm warning you, your shop will go bankrupt! If you don't like our prices, go elsewhere! What gives you the right to call us cheats? If you cheat, you will be called one! My cousin bought the same saree a week ago for just 45 rupees! How can the price increase by 100 in 7 days? I knew there was something fishy! What a shame! I was so confident of your reliability! You didn't keep my faith! There you are Mrs. Mitra! I didn't expect this from you! Adding 1 with a different coloured ink! Think we're idiots? Be careful what you say! We won't tolerate any rudeness... Oh dear! How embarrassing! It's actually my fault, Soumen babu! My husband's not here you know... ...I must have faltered while working late all by myself! Please f-f-forgive me Soumen Babu! This shop is like your own Tell me, has such a thing ever happened before? No, that's why... - Anyone can make a mistake... ...but the way this gentleman behaved... He's not mentally stable right now His w-w-wife is seriously ill! Paralysed. Completely bed-ridden! We find it hard to bear... ...so you can imagine his state! Really? Tch! Tch! Paralysed...? That explains it! I just couldn't fathom why he... She's in a bad way this morning! Mother's asked you to go back as soon as possible! Yes...yes...of course! Forgive me! Not mentally stable you know... Not stable.. Do sit! So you're Soumen Babu's brother-in-law? -Yes Then you're family for us too! We really can't charge you for the saree! Here! 145 rupees - No, no! What is this? Just because of a small mistake... What's your daughter's name? Minu. But Mrs. Mitra... Let this saree be a wedding gift for Minu from Rasmoni Stores No, no, we won't brook any arguments! Instead, let me show you some sarees as gifts for her in-laws... Here... From Shantipur! See how d-e-ense the weave is? Pishima ? So late ? Idiot! Night is the best time for me! Daylight poses certain problems... ...you wouldn't understand Now tell me... ...your husband's away, your bed is empty... ...so why such pains to dress your hair? Who are you planning to cuddle tonight? Pishima! Please go now! I'm sleepy! Who do you think you are? A queen? Why should I go just because you say so? I don't live off your Father! Who's the boy? Boy? What boy? Acting coy again! Who's the boy who follows you... ...on your way back from the shop every day? Think I don't know! I don't know. I haven't seen anyone! Handsome boy! Have you seen his eyes? Full of dreams! Don't refuse him Why stay faithful? Let yourself be swept away! Disgusting! Even hearing this is a sin! Enough of that crap! Sin! All this hoo-ha about sin & virtue, heaven & hell... ...is just stuff & nonsense! I know that now after death! I'm giving you first hand information! Understood? So just go ahead & ravage the boy! Virtuous saint! I'm giving you good advice, you'll regret not taking it! When your body ages & begins to rot... ...then you can bemoan your fate! What do I care! I've collected a lot of sarees for the shop in the last few months! I'm told sarees are cheaper in Surat than in Bombay! I'm going to Surat tommorrow. Not sure when I'll be back... ... please don't worry! Tell Father... ...that Bombay is a far bigger city than Dhaka! The biggest I've ever seen! I am well! My respectful regards to you and Father! Yours Chandan Has he written only to you? No one else? He must be busy... ...so he's written to us all together! Your brother-in-law has already had his breakfast It's time you had yours too! You'll have to rush to the shop after this! Yes, let her eat now. She's been wearing herself out! By the way... ...until Chandan returns. .. ...why don't I go and sit at the shop now & then...? Please! Don't go poking your nose where it doesn't belong! You're landed gentry. Remain that way! Why bother with the shop? Stupid woman! No sense at all... Etwaari! Go & attend to Benu, he's crying his lungs out! Yes, Ma'am! Your sister-in-law is childless! And all you & Chandan can think about is your shop! If you're not careful... ...you'll get old before you know it! It'll be no use repenting then! Youth doesn't last forever, my dear! There's a time for everything under the sun you know! W-w-hat do you want? Why do you f-f-follow me every night? I don't like it one bit! Delicious, isn't he? What did I tell you? I told him off sternly today! That's the way! Be stern at the start! Cast the net... ...& draw him in playfully! Then bring him home, lock the door and... A husband is boring! Like everyday clothes! Colours faded through use! But a stranger is like an expensive silk saree You need to wear those too sometimes! Why? Why should only men have mistresses? Don't women have desires too? Listen... ...youth comes just once in a life time, remember! Once gone, it never comes back! Oh sakhi! (girl friend) This monsoon (rainy season) holds no charm for me Lightning flashes clutch at my heart The house seems empty, forlorn and dark Which way has my beloved gone No one can tell me that This monsoon holds no charm Listen! Are you listening? You stupid woman! He's come, your lover! Must you sleep as soundly as a buffalow? He's at the gate. Won't you go ? Why are you gaping like that? The rain's stopped! Dawn is about to break. Hear the birds chirping? Hurry! I can't hold on to this form much longer! Let me witness this courtship before I go! Stupid bitch! What're you waiting for? If you don't believe me, go to the terrace & see for yourself! I can't stay much longer! Drops of rain quench the thirst of the earth Hurry up! Let's go! Without you, my love, my heart is parched Go! Don't turn him away! Go! The monsoon goes to come back again Youth once gone, will never return The monsoon goes... ...to come back again Youth once gone, will never return Youth once gone, will never return This monsoon holds no charm You should have left early today Ma'am! The wind is rough, it's going to rain soon... ...you'd better hurry! - It's ok! Should I go with you? The distance is not much I'll manage! I do it every day! Reach home safely! - Sure! Drops of rain quench the thirst of the earth Without you, my love, my heart is parched The monsoon goes to come back again Youth once gone, will never return Youth once gone, will never return This monsoon holds no charm Open the door! Open the door! Take down the trunks! They have to be taken inside! Ah...Lata! What's the matter? Why are you crying? You're flushed! Aren't you well? Why did you go to the shop in this condition? What a beautiful rose! How did you know I would return today? Now what...? What...? Death to you! Stupid bitch! Rot in hell! She's back with that jackass again! Tell me... ...do you still believe in gh-o-hosts? Rubbish! I travelled to so many places; never saw hide or hair of one! Don't tell me you still believe in ghosts! Death to you! Death to you both! Ten months later... ...early one morning, in Chaitra (March)... ...I was born After the month of my birth... ...I was named 'Chaitali' She looks like my sister Rasmoni! After a long time... ...a child was born to this family I was adored by one and all! Even the paralysis in my Aunt's tongue... ...was miraculously cured! I became the lucky mascot! Everyone said I looked... ...exactly like my father's aunt Rasmoni! From the shape of my eyes. to my complexion... ... right to the beauty spot on my lip! Only one person seemed worried by this My mother! Pishima! Pishima? No one else ever saw her again... ...not even my mother! Only I knew that there was... ...someone else who lived with us! Someone I've seen ever since I can remember! Someone who's not human, but a ghost... ...my Pishi-thakuma! In the years that followed... ...I grew up surrounded by love & affection Along with me grew our sleepy little town People crossed over from the other side by the hundreds... ...seeking refuge The other side was then in turmoil! The people of East Pakistan were carving out a new identity for themselves... ...based on their mother tongue. Independent Bangladesh! In the middle of all this, I completed my 18th year Come, have some rice pudding! I made it for your birthday Hurry up! Mother's calling me - Here - Mmm! Take this - What is it? Jewellery! Not a speck of gold is missing! Here! You can tally it with the list! Goodness! What ugly, old-fashioned ornaments! Whose are they? Belonged to a great aunt of yours. Rasmoni She had a tragic life... They're yours now What're you talking about? Do I ever wear jewellery? I have no interest in Pishi-thakuma's jewellery My world is made up of... ...my college... ...my friends... ...and someone else... ...from whom I haven't heard... ...for the past 3 months Come on, girl! Why're you moving at snail's pace? Speed up! How long since you received his letter? The last one came in July From Tangail That too after exchanging several hands! From Tangail But that's in East Bengal! Wasn't he working at some news agency in Calcutta? He still is... ...but he's been travelling to East Pakistan... ...to deliver arms! Really? But he is from India! So? Aren't we Indians supporting their fight for freedom? And Benu feels he belongs there! Haven't you read about the student agitation over Bangladesh? Oh, I forgot! Ghosts don't read newspapers! Stop calling me names! So what if I don't? There are many ghosts who read the news regularly! Hmm... If only we could know Mrs. Gandhi's decision about the Bangladesh war! Tell me... ...you've studied so much... ...go to college everyday... ...read the newspapers... ...have your ever thought about... ...how you will manage to marry Benu? His grandfather... ...Ramkhilaon, was beaten to death... ...by the men of this family! Will they spare his grandson? Do you have the courage to go against them? Why else am I going to meet him tomorrow? Don't keep harping about marriage like a bourgeois! Is that the only goal of one's life? Like who? Bourg...? What kind of ghost is that? Never mind. You wouldn't understand! I don't need to! How many of you live in hiding here? Three right now... ...two more will join day after... ... if they can make it across the border! What a state these rooms are in! I've always heard of Rafiq's house... Who is this Rafiq? Do you know? A poet from across the border Lived here for a while after the Partition Of course it wasn't in ruins then! They say he fell in love with a Hindu woman here... ...& committed suicide Unrequited love is a dangerous thing, Chaiti! Do you think you'll succeed...? What if... ...what if you're killed? I will come back again... ...to the banks of the rice-field river... ...in this land of Bengal Not in human form perhaps... ...perhaps as a gull, or a sparrow... ...or the crow at dawn... ...in this land of New Harvest...

What love, what care! What peace reigns under your banyan trees… …and down your rivers flows! O motherland, my mother-tongue is music to my ears O motherland, my mother-tongue is music to my ears He's gone! When you are hurt, my heart is rent… ...and tears drench the earth beneath my feet Oh golden land of Bangla I pledge my love to you Oh motherland! I pledge my love to you! All India Radio, Calcutta Debdulal Bandhopadhyay with the news The headlines this evening are... ...amidst continuous cross fire at the eastern border of India... ...a delegation of 3 will inspect the area tomorrow This was conveyed by the Prime Minister, Mrs. Indira Gandhi In Pratap-pur, a village of Barisal district... ...in a clash with the Pak army several freedom fighters were killed... ...as reported by our special correspondent The extent of collateral damage is yet to be... Why did you turn off the radio suddenly? Now what? What're you sniffling for? It was in Pratap-pur that my in laws had their ancestral home You're overdoing it now! Mother said you'd been there only once in your life That too over 50 years ago! So why this sudden surge of grief? True! I went there only once... ...but I wanted to spend my life there with my husband! No insight despite all your degrees! So what're you waiting for? You don't need passports or visas... ...go make a visit! I did! You did? Not to my in laws'... ...but to my maiden home in Faridpur! The place has been taken over by Pak soldiers! It's an army camp now! Made my blood boil! Better that it were overrun by weeds! I was roaming around sadly... ...when I came across 2 freedom fighters Poor young things! Just martyred in the war! Ghosts? Shame on you! Never call the blind blind the lame lame & ghosts ghosts ...to their faces! It hurts their feelings! No one wants to be a ghost if they can help it! They won't be able to continue their fight much longer! Why? No resources! The freedom fighters are dying like flies at the hands of Pak soldiers No doctors! No arms! No medication! Just the other day... ...a boy died right in front of my eyes for want of medical help! Come... ...let's go out to the terrace! Have a smoke together! Want to...? - Yup! Come! These cigarettes of yours... how do they taste? Good! Like one? No, thanks I'm not used to it! Better stick to my hookah! Want a drag? No, thanks By the way! What news of your Ramkhilaon? Any lovers' meetings? No such luck! Went to look for him first thing after my death I was told that he'd been reborn a long time ago! Anyway... ...what shall we do now? About what? Weren't you just telling me about those poor boys? Being slaughtered by the Pak soldiers! No resources, no... Chaitali! Now what? My box is still there! 5000 grams of gold! 5000! Really! What do you think I'm telling you? Why don't you give that box to the freedom fighters! Maybe they can save our home in Faridpur... Benu...? Just look at that! Gone off somewhere after asking me to come! My keys...? Mother... I'm taking what's mine... ...and leaving here what's yours How could you have spurned so much love? For Somlata... Shimontinee, (married lady) I called in vain, you did not come By a thousand thorns your door was barred Why then in the forest, Shimontinee Why then in the mist, Shimontinee Did you wander alone, lose your way... Why then in the forest did you lead me astray... ...Shimontinee? Shimontinee, now, in the searing flame of your eyes... ...in the flame of the sizzling red dot between your brows... My nights and days have turned to ash Shimontinee... ...beloved kafer! In my love for you I'm forever lost For Somlata, woman of the mist... Beyond the river, in the darkening night You came to gather flowers of mist Between us the flowing river creates a rift Creates a rift between you and me Creates a rift between our broken lands Is that why you came? Woman from beyond the river, leaving all Is that why you came? To build a bond of mist between us? The train storms past, shattering the night Words sink into the bottomless dark Time stops as you gaze into my eyes Unearthly stranger clad in mist! The bonds of mist dissolve in the wind You break the transient link and flee, ephemeral one In the frenzied wind... ...desire for you surges in my veins Desire for you! Kafer, because I fell in love with you All shadows died, stars went out Seas went up in flames! Comets rained from the heavens overhead All creation shuddered in mortal dread Mountains collapsed in the sea! Such devastation, such annihilation All because I fell in love with you! Kafer, because I fell in love with you Spring arrived before its time Every branch was filled with untimely bloom From the ends of the earth a tempestuous gale arose And in my veins, in the flow of my blood Time began its frenzied dance All because I fell in love with you...
