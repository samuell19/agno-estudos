Hey Kate. What's up? The trees are arriving and I don't have the layout that you sent me. Once they're up, they're up. I'm not moving them. They were supposed to come at 9:30. I anticipate a lot with these tree guys but being early is never something to worry about. Especially not two hours early. They must be motivated by the spirit of Christmas. I'm on my way. Just, tell them to go get a coffee. Ca, c'est pas mal. Merci beaucoup, Jeff, pour le vol. Reposez-vous bien et profitez de ces quelque jours. Vous aussi. Bonjour Monsieur Lucas. Have you arrived at the photo shoot? Apologies Kate. I've been delayed thanks to a blizzard. I've just landed in Montana. I really wanted you to come to the shoot today. We're shooting one of our products. You know, just to observe, see how we work before stepping in front of the camera yourself. Unfortunately, I think I will miss this opportunity to see how your people work. Well even we Fortunes can't beat Mother Nature. Perhaps you'll get there before they wrap. Precisely. The car should be waiting for me. I'll be there as soon as I can. Okay, well you get yourself here safely. And we'll launch right into our fragrance partnership when you arrive. And I'll try to put the shoot back, if I can. A bientot! A bientot. How's my favorite art director this morning? Great. I get to meet Lucas Beaudin today. Yes. Right. Lucas has been delayed. So we're going to have to push the photo shoot back. I really want him to see how we work. Oh. Well people are already working on the set, but I can probably push it back an hour or two. Good. We'll meet with him on the fragrance partnership after that. I want that deal closed. There he is at his nightclub in Paris. And on his vineyard. His life is a party every night. Yeah, but those are solid investments. I mean, in addition to his tech assets, his winery has great terroir. His wines, they win awards. I know, I captured everything in my mood boards. I think he's perfect for you. No, this is just strictly business. First of all, my clubbing shoes are a little dusty. And second of all, my age, I'm more like his... Aunt. Oh well. Let's talk about our favorite subject. Christmas! I've rescued the trees. And I'll have everything in place as soon as we clear out the greenhouse after the shoot. Ah good, yes. About that, I was wondering if you could just stand in? Because our model is grounded in New York. No chance. You helped me put my modeling career behind me. It was time. We agreed. I know. But you still have those perfect lips. And I always will. It's just a few hours. New York. Snowstorm. Grounded. But the Sugarplum Celebration is my priority. December 26th is coming up fast. It's not like I have forgotten. I mean, it's the second best day of the year after Christmas. And you always make that look so beautiful, Robin. Your guests have very high expectations. I have to make this party even better than last years. By the way, thank you for live streaming the whole event this year. No pressure. At all. Well if I can throw a hot ticket Christmas party like my annual Sugarplum Celebration and get social hits for our company at the same time... Why wouldn't I? Pretty please? No. Just no. Not these lips. Okay, fine. Well... Just send everybody home then. Tell them all good bye. Call the photographer, and the makeup artist, and the hairstylist, that we don't need them. Oh, and your inspiration for the greenhouse, you know, it's all for naught. Fine. For the test shoot only. How can I say no to my Boss and my Godmother at the same time? Well you can't. I am so glad that the company, and the lip gloss and I, can count on you. Merry Christmas. Christmas is coming! Lucas. It's Gerald Fortune. I... Lucas! Lucas! Ah, let me guess. A beautiful woman, uh. You should see what they do for Christmas here! Is she a model? Don't... Don't what? Judge you? I judge you because you forget that a beautiful woman... Is also a real woman, darling. I know that. I sometimes just forget. When she's exceptionally beautiful. And I've seen her as the Face of Fortune on a hundred billboards. Wow! Do you still think you will come home for Christmas Eve? I heard that in Montana next week the weather will be well below freezing. You could get frostbite. Ne t'inquiete pas, Maman. I won't be here more than a few days. Don't worry. I know. You are importing wine into the U.S. and the publicity you will get from the perfume will double your media exposure and drive your brand. Apparently, my son's a 'brand'. Apparently, this 'brand' is about to go global. Darling, you're in the city where your biological father lives. This could be a good chance to meet him. I am my own man, Maman. I haven't needed him in the past. I don't need him now. Ah la la la la... All this ambition. I wish you'd gotten it from me. Maman. Allez. Bisous. Bisous. Dressed a little fancy for the weather, don't you think? The Face of Fortune. Former. Former Face of Fortune. Come warm up. Great. We're ready for our last look everyone. Ah, no. Over there. Great. Let's see our test shots. ♪ - Ready? - Yes. All right. So good. Yes. Play with the dress. Show the gloss. Just like that again. Amazing! Ah, yes. Play with it! One more with the shoulder. Incredible. That's the one. Phenomenal. Let's check these out. Very beautiful. Well, I guess. We must have met in Paris? Unlikely. We seem to have run in very different crowds. You are spectacular in your ads. I really like number eight, Jessie. Are you producing today too? Well no. I'm the Head of Art Direction for Fortune Industries. And sometimes pinch hitter model. I used to like modeling but I love the creativity behind the art of advertising, photography, campaign creation, so much more. Impressive. So why were you pinch hitting? Our model's stuck in New York due to weather. I can never say no to Kate. Especially at Christmas. She has a particular way of charming everyone into bending to her will. Especially family. So you're related? Not by blood but by godparent. She was my Mom's best friend. Was? Have they fallen out? No, not like that. My Mother passed away. I'm sorry. I overstepped. I thought Kate was coming here but she must've gotten caught up on a call. I'll take you to her when we're done the shoot. - Thank you. - Okay. All right. We're going to do a couple more. It's right this way. Ah! Bonjour, Lucas! Bonjour. Parlerons-nous francais? Oh, English is fine, Ms. Fortune. Evidemment. Although I really should practice my French more. But it's better than my Mandarin, so... And call me Kate. And we are celebrating! We are celebrating our partnership and Christmas. Stay with us Robin. Merci. Cheers. Enchanté. And welcome. Merci. So, you've read my proposal. Fortune Industries is branching into Europe with its first... Men's fragrance. Very smart. It will help to grow your top line in Europe. You need that. So you've done your homework on Fortune Industries. What can I say, I like research, I like numbers. I know what I need to know about Fortune Family. And I like your personal brand. Your nightclub. Your winery. And your team does social media night and day. And now your business is at the point, were if you to expand to the U.S. market, you either need a major marketing effort here in the States, or voila, join forces with a men's fragrance and let what we plan for advertising do the heavy lifting. True, I want to expand my brand in the U.S. and beyond. And on that note, I need the numbers you're committing to the advertising. Well, that depends on if you'll finally agree that it's your image and not your club that will be what the campaign focuses on. Yes, I understand that will be part of the price I'll be paying. But I have to admit, the deal was too attractive to refuse. And you've turned us down in the past. But I'm not my brother Gerald. The deal works. And I don't go into a business to fail. Neither do I. Ever since Gerald got sick and I took control of this company, I've been expanding it. How is Gerald doing? He's tough as nails. And 100 percent behind this. For Fortune Industries, men's fragrance is the new frontier. You remind me a lot of him. I am nothing like that man. Beaudin for Men. It's all about you. Astute. Savvy. Why the sudden interest? The time is right. Male fragrance sales are skyrocketing. And your personal brand speaks to that mysterious, successful business man that women love and men want to be. We can benefit your core business. And you can benefit ours. It's a win win. But I think we both know that our interest in you isn't sudden. It's purely business to me. I lend my image to my brand every day. Your social media support is pure brilliance. My team is excellent. Ah, you're being humble. It's perfect. Your product blended with a just enough of your personality to legitimize the connection. That's an interesting choice of words. Whether it's my wine, my club, I curate it. And I control it. Yes. Clear. You wouldn't be a successful entrepreneur if you didn't. I need final approval on the creative and the product quality. And I need final approval on manufacturing and the international roll out. Agreed. Agreed! Fastest negotiation ever. So, Lucas, has Robin given you the tour? Ah a little. The greenhouses are enchanting. The greenhouses. Those have been Robin's playhouse since she was a little girl. Her Mother loved flowers. And that's probably why her art direction includes so much lovely greenery and flowing bouquets. Especially at Christmas time. For her Foyer this year, it's been inspired by the 'Magic of Paris'. That magic is close to my heart. And to yours, I'm sure? Oh, not so much anymore. I've discarded all of my Parisian dreams, thanks to not one but two French husbands. Those dreams are all Robin's now. Well, I have to re-schedule the campaign photographer to tomorrow afternoon, so we've booked you at the Hiltshire. Excuse me, I have to go make those calls. I will email you the schedule. Sure. Thank you. Je dois y aller aussi. Oh, thank you so much. And I will have my staff get you a more appropriate winter coat. Oh. Okay. Thank you. - Au revoir. - Au revoir. Gerald? You're my brother and I love you, but - Yes, he's here. I just met with him. And you know the only reason I could have gotten him here so quickly was to jump the gun and set up the campaign photography without the deal signed. I had to give up product and creative. So you're welcome. What do I think of him? I think your apple hasn't fallen far from the tree, that's what I think. Oh, yes. Our tree. I stand corrected. He's a lot like us. I like him. I think I've met my match and then some. Just remember who got him here - me. And who needs to speak with him - you. So, this baton has been passed. Great job today, Jessie. Thank you so much. And I'll see you at the shoot. - Yeah. - All right. You look ridiculous. When in Montana... Kate insisted. You live here. Would you be able to recommend a restaurant for dinner? Ah, Eileen's. It never disappoints. Any chance you can join me tonight. Ha! No thank you. Here's my card. Now that I have creative approval, we need to talk. I reviewed the mood boards. They don't work for me. Not a problem. Send me your notes. Where do I even start? Frivolity. Excess. Portraying my life as pointless, immature, shallow. You're saying I need to re-think the whole direction? Yes, I am. The creative doesn't align with me personally. I'm saying you don't know me at all. I'm saying you should postpone. And I'm saying that nicely. Dinner? Ah, let's make it breakfast. Eight a.m. tomorrow. My hotel. Hey Becca. Come out to Karaoke tonight! I am just looking at what a crack social media team can do. You need to come out once in a while! I miss your terrible singing. Please say you'll come. Next week. I promise. Have fun. Hey there, Prince. Hey. Are you the best Prince Charming there ever was? How's my birdie? I'm fine, Dad. Oh no. You're not fine. Come here. Give me a hug. So. Is it work? Or is it personal? Or just life in general? Oh, it's work. Someone didn't like my vision for a campaign today. No! That's not possible. True, though. "Not aligned with me personally". Oh, okay. So you don't understand this person then? Harsh, Dad. No. He's just pulling rank. Because he can. Well is he right? Maybe. You like to get right to the tough stuff. I do what I can. Well, you might have a point. Possibly he's coming from a deeper level on this. Maybe he's not as superficial as I thought. People thought you were superficial when you were a model. Right? I mean, you're a human being, but people didn't see that. Most people kind of assume that models are a little flaky. And I just did that to a handsome French night club owner. Oh! Yeah, I walked away from being the Face of Fortune because it never represented who I truly was. I think that's where I was going with this. He's not his brand image. That's his team. He's, he's smart. Okay. Now this guy definitely sounds interesting. And I need to apologize. And re-think. Thanks, Dad. Your hugs cure all. Best Dad ever. Oh. Well. I try. You know I'm a pretty good listener. And I've noticed that these last three weeks that you've missed Karaoke night with your friends. Come on! You've got to get there. Go, have some fun. I will. But tonight, I have a date with my Prince. Are you going to ride out to your Mom's marker? Yeah. I need to be there sometimes. It helps me think. Yeah, I know. It's been a very difficult year for us. It's our first Christmas without her. I miss her every day, Dad. I do too. You know, it was the way that she showed us love at this time of year. I mean, she just made us both feel very very special. And she succeeded too. I'm trying to get in the spirit to honor her. But sometimes I still get so sad. Hey, come here. Now, you're going to get out there. I don't care if it's Karaoke or riding horses. But you're going to start having some fun. I'll sing it from the saddle. I love you, sweetheart.

I don't owe you a call. I don't owe you anything. Someone must miss his Maman to be calling me so early in the morning. Oh, desole. I should have checked the time. It's all right. I was up feeding the cat. For our Christmas, family Christmas, do you want me to bring anything? I don't know. Lucas, I know you did not call me at this hour to talk about Christmas plans. Have you seen him? No. I'm sure that you have questions. Otherwise you wouldn't be in Montana at all. And definitely not visiting aunt Kate. Yeah. Maybe you're right. Maybe a part of me is a little bit curious. I'm sure. And perhaps for one moment you could think about where your talent for business comes from. Hmm? It's too little, it's too late. He missed a lot of your life, but it's not too late. He's your Father, Lucas. He's nothing. Maman, I'm sorry. My lawyer's calling. And a very Merry Christmas to you, young lady. Merry Christmas to you, too, Santa. Do the elves have everything ready? Ho ho ho! Good morning, Robin. Coffee? Please. Coffee please. Lucas, I want to sincerely apologize to you for making assumptions about you for the campaign. Thank you. I like the way you start the day. I just went with the lowest common denominator of your nightclub-and-wine playboy persona. I didn't take the time to dig beneath the surface and get to know who you really are. I went with the obvious. I suppose it is obvious. But this is not the full truth about me. I know, it's superficial, one note. There's no depth, no complexity to my art direction. The games room, playing poker, stark lighting. Over-used stereotypes of masculinity. What? Do you mean this man is "a player"? Well. If your social media is to be believed. But there's more to me than that. Passion for business. Drive. I love Christmas. And I can't wait to celebrate with my Mom. I'm happy when I'm walking, out on my land or in the back streets of Paris. I hear you. I know, it sounds kind of strange because I've never actually lived there, but I feel homesick for the streets of Paris. Long walks, observing life. It's very French. I must've been there a hundred times because of my modeling. And my Mom was always with me. We hung out all day and night. But we never had time to actually see the city. It was always airports, taxis, dressing rooms, runways. C'est dommage. A pity? Yes and no. I loved modeling. All work and no play. That is a pity. That was a long time ago. I still dream of finding the time to go back there and wander, explore. Enough about me. It's you I need to get to know if we're going to pull this off. I need to understand what it is you want to represent. Well, I like to know the person I'm working with so let's agree that the best course of action is to get to know each other a little more than what the glossy ads and the insta feeds show us. Fine. We should schedule more time then. Later today? Four? I will have the limousine pick you up. Oh no. My place. We're doing this on my terms. You know what you want. I like it. Honestly? I never lie to anyone I'm dating. Well, we're not dating. Are you seeing anyone? Not at the moment. There are some crummy guys. Some nice ones. But even then, they were just nice. None for the long term. I can't find the right woman to begin with. I feel like women are interested in my public persona not the person I really am. It's not really the winner's circle for either of us. Four p.m. I'll send the address. Oh, and I know what you should get your Mom for Christmas. You haven't even met her. She's a Mom, isn't she? Yes, she'll love it.

And you know the devastating year I've had. The last thing I need is a French millionaire playboy in my heart. And how's it that I even know one of those anyway? It sounds ridiculous saying the words "French millionaire playboy". And what exactly is not positive about that? It's kind of funny. I'm just not ready yet. Back to work. Meet me in the stables. No white dress tonight? Despite what you saw at work yesterday, I don't do formal wear. Somehow you look perfect in anything you put on. Thanks, but this fits me best. You could use another layer or two. - So we're actually... - What? Going out on a one horse open sleigh? One horse. Sleigh. So my favorite place to be is wherever there are horses. Lucas - meet Prince. Prince. My favorite place to be is wherever there are cocktails. I dressed for dinner. I thought you'd like a real Montana experience. A legendary sleigh ride.

Prince, right? I did not see that coming. I'm impressed! Do you want me to harness him or find us some blankets? You're speaking my language. The blanket box is in the back. Merci.

So sweet. When she was two, she was obsessed with chickens, in a weird sort of way. Baaak! So embarrassing! Third, she's kind of a date fumbler. Yeah, I don't know what's wrong with her. - Dad! - It's just so sad. Maybe we could focus on my competitive riding days. Allow me! Allow me guys! Are you seeing this? I'm admitting defeat. I have tried but I cannot find a single fault. Well, please tell me you will not fumble this. I was counting on you to fumble it. At the least, you could give him a hard time! Honey? A hard time? The guy does dishes. That's Robin on a family trip. Oh, and there she is with her braces that she just loved so much, she didn't want removed. Isn't that right? Do you have any with crimped hair? Oh yeah! When will this end? Who is this lovely lady? That's my late wife, Veronica. Oh, elle est tres belle. Yes, she was beautiful. Umm. If you'll excuse me. I'm going to give you two some alone time. Loosing someone is hard. Last year must have been tough on you and your Dad. It was. It still is. You must miss her a lot. I do. She gave me everything. My love for horses. My love for flowers. I am who I am because of her. She sounds like a wonderful woman. I wish I could have met her. She saw the best in people. She made you want to be better. She would've seen right through all that stuff that's out there about you. Unlike me. Hey. It's easy not to see the real me. Sometimes it's convenient for me to hide behind my public image. It keeps people at arm's length. Although I'm getting tired of it. When I saw your impression of me in the campaign... No, it made me think about what I want the next phase of my life to be. I want the campaign to reflect that. To reflect you. I want you to see who I really am. My Mom would've loved you. I mean, she loved France. In fact, it was our dream. We had plans to travel. She will always be with you. Will you stop saying all the right things. I'm really starting to... And I think she would have loved you even more than my Dad does. We were going to go to Paris this Christmas and see all the sights. It's so hard this year... Hey. I think... Yes? We should call it a night. Okay. Robin. Thank you. - Hi. - Hi. Merry day before Christmas Eve! I think Kate's in her office. I already signed the deal with her. I'm here for you. I wanted to thank you for a great time yesterday. And, I brought you a little something. A 'farewell' gift, if you will. You're leaving? Tonight. Back to Paris. I promised my Mom I'd be home for Christmas. Right. It's beautiful. It'll go perfectly on the tree. Well, I should get back to work. After this I have to start on the mood boards for the campaign. I'll be ready to present some new ideas to you as soon as you're back. Great. Au revoir Robin. I could use some help. From a Paris expert, if you will. Avec plaisir. Impressively researched. Ha! Very funny. Oh here. I need you to taste this mulled wine. Thank you. And tell me if tastes like it really does at the Christmas markets. Mmm. Bravo. - Good! - Yeah. You read my mind. This is my favorite part of the holidays. Oh look! I actually found... Macaron decorations. And real candles. Okay, real-ish. They're battery operated for safety, but the mood is the same. I've never seen anyone so passionate about tree garnish.

I think this new venture is going to bring me back here a lot. Did Kate pay you to say that? No, I'm serious. Are you ready for your flight? Ah. I hate to leave. I'm not ready to say goodbye to you but I made a promise I'd be home for Christmas. I don't want you to go either. But family is important. Come with me. To Paris? - Yes. - Well... Because you're right. Christmas in Paris is magical. It would be an honor to share it with you. Plus you can get to know my world. You know, inspiration for the shoot. Just pick up and go? Ah.

No. This is what we always do on Christmas Eve. We celebrate! Well, it's gorgeous. And so elaborate. Plus important, c'est delicieux. Delicious. We always have a traditional Christmas dinner on Christmas Eve. And on Christmas Day is just for presents. Tell me everything! One year, Lucas's Uncle Thomas, dressed up as Pere Noel. Poor Lucas was so afraid of the beard. He hide, he cried. He cried so much that he ended up... What's the word? Umm... Blah! Maman! Robin doesn't want to know that stuff. Oh yes I do! Oh la la. And then my poor boy had an asthma attack. Oh, I didn't know you have asthma. Only when I'm upset or really stressed. I'm good. Each time he wheezed, I would sit beside him and worry. Maman, you're wonderful. Cheers to Camille. Santé! Santé! Santé! Thanks again for a lovely dinner. Oh, thank you so much for coming. Your son can be very persuasive. I have never seen him so happy. You are the first girlfriend he's ever brought to meet me. - Really? - Uh huh. I figured there must've been many. No. Just you. Oh perhaps a little girl in kindergarten named Charlotte. I'm so happy he brought you. Bonne nuit. Good night. Hey Dad. Merry Christmas from far away! Ho ho ho! Your Uncle Jeff says 'Hello'! So how's Paris? I just had to follow my heart. Yeah, of course you did. You know, your Mom and I, we almost got married on our first date. We drove around Las Vegas looking for a chapel but they were all booked. She'd get so embarrassed every time I tell that story. I miss her something awful. Me too. I see her everywhere here. She'd want us to be happy for the holidays. Yeah, I keep trying. Merry Christmas, Dad. I'll be back by the time you get home. Say 'hi' to Uncle Jeff. I will. Merry Christmas, sweetheart. Love you. I love you too. I'm in France, Mom. For Christmas Eve. Hello? Hello Robin. It's Gerald Fortune. I'm glad you slept well. I did. It was so comfortable. Oh! - Merry Christmas! - Joyeux Noel! Joyeux Noel! It smells delicious. You haven't cooked in years! It's about time. It's part of your Christmas present, Maman. Although I'm still full from your feast last night. Oh la la. What do you say if we open presents after we eat? Presents? There's presents? You're funny. When has Pere Noel ever forgotten about you? Hmm? À la table. ♪ Oh! Look at this! ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year ♪ ♪ ♪ Good tidings we bring to you and your kin ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year ♪ We are so grateful for our Christmas bounty. So, what do you have planned for today? I have a surprise for Robin. Are you up for a drive? A drive along the French countryside with you? Sounds terrible. Ah, look at her! ♪ On s'approche. We are getting closer to our wine. Oh yeah. You can see that the whole property belongs to my family. ♪ I can't believe this place! Everything is just so magical. It has its charms. - And it's yours? - Uh huh. All yours? Un plaisir non partagé n'est plaisir qu'à moitié. What does that mean? It means this is a place for sharing. With you. Whoa! Does anyone actually live here? I live here sometimes. But it's far from the city. And it can get lonely. Come, I'll show you the cellars. I bought this vineyard for the old vines. They produce better wines. But growing up not too far away, it feels like home. A stylish country boy. With a vineyard. And his own plane. I can be a country boy sometimes, can't I? - You certainly can. - Mind your head. Let me share one of our favorite vintages. You'll tell me. Cheers. Ah. This is stunningly delicious! You are stunningly beautiful. I'm really glad you brought me here. And I'm glad you came. And I want you to know. You can tell me anything. I'd never judge you. A part of me wants to sell the nightclub and settle down. And just, live on my land. Sipping wine. Watching sunsets. The winery could use a visionary art director. You don't need much art directing here. There's beauty everywhere you look. I couldn't agree more. Lucas. I need to tell you something. And I also need you to listen with an open mind and without judgement. Anything. It is my Christmas present. Gerald Fortune called me last night. What? Why did he call you? He told me the truth about his relationship to you. This man is nothing to me. You have no right to interfere with my life. That man has no right to interfere with my life. Kate told him we were spending Christmas together, so he called. Lucas, the man is very sick. I don't want to hear anything he has to say. I know he's hurt you. He rejected me! I know. All my life I've struggled with knowing my biological father never wanted to get to know me. He didn't show up. Even once. He has never even acknowledged me. Nothing. Lucas, I have known Gerald my whole life. He's not the same man he was back then. He knows how much he's hurt others. It's too late for me. It's just too late. You must be curious too or you wouldn't have done the deal either. You came to see your aunt, your family. I know you think you're helping. But this is my life. Not yours. Lucas, I'm sorry. If this is moving way too fast, I was just trying to help. I never should have said those things. I never should have presumed your feelings. Or preached to you. And, really, when I think about it, I don't really know what I'm doing here. You were right. This is your world. Maybe I should just go back to mine. Maybe it would be best. Lucas? Please. May we talk? You care about her. And she cares about you. She doesn't have any idea. Lucas, she has a point. It might be good for you to find out what he's like. Ask any questions. That, that... He didn't want anything to do with me and now he wants to come into my life? Gerald called me too. That's why you suddenly want me to meet him. People do change, mon cher. Allez. Chocolat chaud. Look. I was young and in love. Once upon a time. I met Gerald when I was working as a nanny in Montana. I thought we were going to last forever. I was going to tell him that I was pregnant with you. But then I found out that he was not going to leave his wife. I was so stupid. Attends, attends. You were going to tell him about me? But you never did? You never told him? I am so sorry. I wanted to so much. All those years, I felt rejected by him. But he didn't even know I existed. How could you? When he didn't want to leave his wife, I was so hurt. He didn't want to have me, so I didn't want him to have you. I came home pregnant with you. And I never looked back. And by the time Gerald heard about you, you were already grown. Maman. All these years. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I let you believe that you were rejected. And after all these years have passed... I was afraid to tell you that it was my fault. And then I realized that depriving you of your Father was so much worse than depriving Gerald of his son. I wanted to protect you. But I hurt you instead. I'm so sorry. How could you keep this from me? Let me think he abandoned me? Believe me, if I could do things differently, I would. I love you. I understand. You hated Gerald your whole life. You are an adult now. You have to let go of this burden or it will destroy you. I don't know, Maman. I don't know. Guilt carries the same weight. It almost destroyed Gerald. He wants to make amends before it's too late. I need to take some time. Right now. Ah. There he is. Ca va, Jean. Merci pour y-allez. What happened? I believe you saw your future slip away and then you passed out. But luckily I had my rescue inhaler. You take it. Robin? Did she come back? No. She's gone. May I offer some motherly advice? Have I ever been able to stop you? You've had more success in business than you could ever dream of. I am so proud of you. You have everything in life you could wish for. Everything except... Love. All she wanted to do was to help. Yes, maybe it was not her place, but it came from the heart. And now you're just being stubborn. Like your Father. Mmm. Mais vous vous depassez, Jean. You're right, Maman. Tu as raison. I just want to meet him on my own terms. What? You thought I was never going to do it? Not without a little push. I hate to say it, but I've been playing the moment I meet him in my head for my whole life. Will he recognize what I've accomplished without him? Understand that, I don't need him. Will he be proud of me? It's so much easier to push him away than to open myself up to rejection. I have never seen you take the easy way out. I won't be able to stand it if he rejects me again. Lucas. He did not reject you then. He won't reject you now. And Robin... She won't refuse you either. So, go. Get her. She's the one. She's the one. Merci, Maman. Fuel the jet. I'm on my way. There's one right there by the window. Hey Robin. Hey Becca. What are you doing tonight? Washing my hair. Walking my cat. Want to go to a party? The Sugar Plum Party? Yes! I'm going to the Sugar Plum Party! That's right. That's exactly what I want. And I want it today. She doesn't want to see you, Lucas. Nothing personal, at least not from me, anyway. You have every right to want to keep me away. But I came here to say I'm sorry. Look, I'm sure that's genuine. You don't mind me saying so, I'm not sure that you deserve my Robin. All she wanted to do was help. I know. She didn't deserve that. I had years of anger built up and I unleashed it on her. Well she's not here right now. She doesn't want to see you. I actually came here to talk to you. Come on in. ♪ Hi. Thanks for coming. Okay, Lucas. Let's do this. On y va. Becca! You made it. I thought you needed a few hugs. More than a few. I need as many as you can spare. What would I do without you? Sing Karaoke in tune, maybe? My Mom packed you some of her homemade Christmas caramels. Seriously? What would I do without you and your Mom? And the caramels? Let's go eat some in the back. Cool. I want you to talk to Mark because... Please excuse me. There's my best-selling face! Bon soir, Kate. My handsome nephew. Welcome to the family. Officially. Is Robin here? Ah, you know she'd rather be anywhere else. But yes, she's here under protest. She says it's jet lag but I know it's something more. But before that... Come with me. There's someone who's been waiting a long time to meet you. I'll let you two get acquainted. Play nice. Gerald. Lucas. It's good to finally set eyes on you. You have your Mother's eyes. Camille! Her name is Camille. I haven't forgotten her. Never will. I suppose you're angry with me. Of course I'm angry with you. You lied to my Mother, and then you threw her away and went back to your family. And you expect us - what? To suddenly have a relationship now? Because you say so? I really don't. I'm just an old man who wants to meet his son and apologize. I apologized to Camille, and her heart was big enough to forgive me. I'm here because I realized that I'm tired of resenting you. Good. Resentment is a wasted emotion. It's certainly wasted on me. I've been following your successes. And your life from afar. And for what it's worth, I'm very proud of you. Thank you. Look, I don't want or need anything from the Fortune family. This isn't about money. If I thought it was, do you think I'd try so hard to track you down? I just wanted to set eyes on you, see what kind of man you are. So what kind of man am I? A much better man than I am. That's for sure. I wasn't expecting that. I hear you may be spending more time in Montana with this deal that Kate's cooked up? That, and, Montana has its charms. That it does. You know you and I are quite similar. Successful, and ambitious... Unable to commit. I'm sorry for what I did to your Mother. And you. Didn't you love your wife? Oh I did. I just didn't appreciate her the way I should have. But that's where I believe we are different. I hope so. I know so. You're too smart to make the same mistakes I did. Maybe not the same mistakes. But I've fallen head over heels for someone and I pushed her away. I assume we're talking about Robin. I saw her downstairs and she looks as beautiful as ever. But she seemed to be lacking that spark. Do you want her back? Oh, absolument. Pour le reste de ma vie. Alors, jamais laissez partir. I've known Robin ever since she was little. And she's always had an infinity for the color purple. This... was your Grandmother's. My Mother's. I think you could put it to good use. I, I couldn't. Besides, I have my own. It's beautiful. But what does it mean to you? That means... That I know the top jewelers in New York. This means I know my family. Thank you. Do you think that I'd be able to see you again? Yes. I think so. Thank you. That's more than I expected. More than I deserve. How'd it go? Better than I ever expected. I want to thank you for everything. I solve problems. That's what I do. And this family has a lot of problems. - Sorry. - Oh sure. Here he comes. Robin! Don't. I don't want to hear what you have to say. I'm sorry. I behaved horribly. Well, you're not wrong. But I had no right to be angry with you. We should have talked about it. I'm just not used to being so open. Well, I'm sorry too. I'm sorry that I forced you into a situation that you weren't ready for. I'm sorry that I went to Paris with you... Je suis fou de toi. I'm crazy about you. That's all I know. Oh, please stop. I'm here for work. There you are, Robin. How about you show us your new vision for the campaign? Ah, I'm so excited! Sure. Oh good. Sorry to take you away from all the fun. It'll just be a moment. Come on. It's crisp, clear-headed, real. It's just you and your world. It's about fresh air, and moving through the world exactly the way you want to. It's inspiration for how you curate your life. That's the most beautiful thing ever said about any human being. Well. What do you think, Lucas? I mean, this campaign is so genuine. Like the real you. I think you're the first person ever to see the real me. Thank you, Robin. So then, you approve? Robin can set up the shoot? Not quite. First, I want to shoot at least some of the campaign in France for authenticity. Second, having Robin, the face of Fortune, in these ads will join our brands and family. I want you with me, Robin. And I won't move forward without that. I've just given you my best creative vision. And now you want my image, too? You know I'm done with modeling. And with a lot of other things. You two are part of the family that I care about. I want to bring together. That's beautiful. But it really is up to Robin. Me? I'm done. So things are not okay then. I'm fine. He just that he has a lot of positive qualities. You're on his side? I'm not on a side. It's just that he wanted to let you in. You know, he showed you his home, his country. Well, he didn't try to stop me when I left. Well, maybe you should look at this from a male perspective. You know, guys, we need help sometimes. Oh by all means. Please. Explain it to me Dad. It's just, you forced Lucas to face something that he wasn't ready to. Maybe it's easy for you to face your feelings, but a lot of guys, we have a hard time with that. Oh poor men. Look, I'm just saying - he got angry, you're upset. That's a huge mess. I can agree with you on the 'huge mess' part. Thanks, Dad. I meant what I said, Robin. I want you with me. So we can pick up our public personas again? And I can be forced to pretend I'm a part of your world? No. Not just in the photos. That would never be enough. I want you to be with me. In my life. I want you to be with me. Forever. I love you, Robin. I knew it from the minute I met you. You... you love me? I love you. You came into my life and you brought happiness and hope. Please, with you I am a better man. Will you marry me? I'm sorry. But the answer is no. 'No'? You don't love me? That's not the point. You can't just buy me with gifts and flowery words. I need you to know who I am. I want you to know what I like, what I fear, what I dream... You wear purple because that was your Mother's favorite color. Your work is not just your work, it feeds your soul. If you don't want to be the face of Fortune anymore, that's fine. I'm not asking you to be. Your new campaign reveals the real me to the world, but it's not complete, I am not complete... Without you. I am in love with you. And whether we're sleighing through Montana or walking alongside the Champs-Élysées, you are where I want to be. Lucas... This ring... is a part of the history of my family. The family you helped me to know. And, it would be my honor if you will accept. I already asked your Dad and he gave me his permission. At least I took his bear hug as a yes. Yes!
