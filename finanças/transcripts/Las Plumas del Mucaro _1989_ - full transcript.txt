Boricua Animation Presents The Feathers of the Múcaro (Múcaro : Type of owl) Excuse me, Mr.Woodpecker. A little bit higher. No, no, no, sorry. To the right. Son, make up your mind. No, no, no, to the left. To the left a little bit Blessed. There, there is where th sun comes in. If I make it bigger it will be a door instead of a window. I want it big. I love light. Besides, this is my house. I know, I know, it's alright. Hey we've been looking for you. We need some music To organize a bembé in the Two Waterfalls pond. Oh no, oh no, he can't right now... He's making me some work Meeting at the Yunke! Go there! You guys go to the meeting. I... ...will stay here. What's the problem, my brother? The Guaraguao said everybody should go. Come on little Mucaro, don't be shy now. Don't make us beg you. I'm too ugly to go to an international celebration. Look at my feathers. Hey Múcaro. You look like a telenovela character with all that whining. Look, I'll finish the window after the celebration, meanwhile i'll go party. To the Flowerly May celebration I'll go party... Well, Chango. Chango, have a good time. You can be sure of that, my brother. I wish I were like you. Look at these feathers... What are you complaining about? Three colors, I only have one, black. Black but shiny. If you want to shine... ...soak in oil Ha ha ha! Boy, so what? I'm what I am and you're what you are. Let's go to the meeting for a while And then to the party! Each one will bring the best nectars the best fruits and the best grains from their regions. And the best fishes. The Cotorra and the Zumbador will be in charge of the decoration. I bring bad news. The Múcaro says The Múcaro says he's not coming because he feels ugly. So if we don't get him some feathers there will not be Mucara representation That's not possible I organized this celebration and everybody must come. Even by force. Yes, for sure. By force? The Múcaro is our friend and although he's insecure we all want him to come to the celebration. Each one of us gives a single feather so he fells good. Give one feather? No, I don't go there. In tha case I want some purple feathers for my plumage. For my pretty neck. Misters, this is serious. Stop it. Here, the only one with a problem is the Múcaro So each one give one feather and be done with it. No, I won't give anything. Me neither. It's not a gift. We'll only lend it for a few hours. I won't gift nor lend. Actually the little Múcaro could use some color. The black one here could too. What is it Cuca? Are you a racist? I don't need foreign feathers. I am what I am, and proud I am! I want you all cleaned up after the party. Hey where are you going, give it here. I've always loved volunteers like you. If you ask me. This little Múcaro will look like a Tincaya. But since nobody asked you, shut up. The Alcatraz should take them in his bag. No. I will keep those feathers. Nothing will leave this place. Those feathers won't arrive, let's go to the pond. Look! Look! There comes the Guaraguao, Vulture. Ready. And look who's coming there. The Chango. Let's go distract them. Yes. Now with a rumba we'll fix everyting. Flowery May, May Give me the flowers, flowers Today I salute you, salute you With a thousand loves, loves The feathers! Look, this is my feather. We fell into a trap, apparently. Yes, and there could be more. Now I can go to the party With all these little feathers And even if they're borrowed. I will party till sun comes up I will be the most beautiful bird of the party. Here comes the Alcatraz Pelican. And he's loaded. Here I bring A snapper, a balbo, a grouper A mackerel. Wow. And what are we going to eat? Grapes! Hurry up Cotorra, here he comes.

The Cuban representative. And the one from Hispaniola. Welcome friends. Here's the islander rhythm. The representative from... ...from... The representative from... ...from, from, from... It's me Mañito, the little Múcaro What's that? Who's the little one? The Múcaro from Borinquen! Is that a joke, Cuca? Is that a Múcaro? How can I explain? I present Mañito, the Múcaro Hi. Who looks horrible today. Chango, play. In my island, we've never seen a bird like this. Hail Mary! see how they look at me! The Guacamayo from Colombia. The Lord from the Andes The Quetzal from Central America. I don't have that kind of feather. If I could borrow some... Dance, tiger. Come on Múcaro, come on! Jow I enjoy with my little feathers. I actually dance better with these. Hey Cuca, attention, we're gonna start a fight. - We're... - Shhhhh - We're starting it... - Dance Come on, tiger. Forget those feathers and enjoy it to the fullest. The little Múcaro's rhythm! Play Those aren't your feathers... Take care of mine! Give them back now! You're ruining mine too! Give them back! You can keep mine! You people are crazy. Bye! these feathers are mine. So crazy! Hey look, he left! Stop it! The Múcaro has left with the feathers. He's escaping. You go over here! Cotorra, go upwards! Vulture, over there. Over there, over there. That was close. Vulture, don't be stupid, it's me, Cuca. Let me go. We lost him. He's quite smart. Let's cancel it, I can't see at night. Me too. Now, that Múcaro is going to stay alone cause if we see him he's gonna regret it. For having stealed my feathers. No, my feathers. Our feathers. I am what I am. You are what you are. How's life when you have more and more... There is no need to live of what is not ours Even though one must give and share But I am what I am. And you are... what you are Ok, Ok. I'll give them back. Every one of them. Give back what? Oh, but that's the Múcaro Why are you hiding there? They're looking for me. Looking for who? You? They lent me these feathers but after going to the party with them I will keep them and am not giving back anything You're leaving Borinquen? You're going North? Are you gonna hide forever? No. I will fly at night. But birds can't fly at night. You'll be left alone Without your friends I don't care The beauty of these feathers compensates for any sacrifice. Hear what he says? That the beauty of the feathers... YOUR feathers are so pretty! Eh? Blessed. It is worthy! In that case, fly with us. Yes Yes! Why not. Let's go Let's go up. Wait for me, wait for me! I am...
