Enemy has started showing his colors. He knows that the chains of law are in my feet. He wants to finish my sport. Boss, should we also start our game? Look dear, in our business there are only two types of.. ..sports which keep us steady in this business. First is money and the second is the politician. Chiman has minister on his side, that's why he is jumping so much. I will definitely avenge Shah's death. You know the boys, who have killed Shah, don't you? - Yes. Find them out and tell this to honest policemen. Yes. Now Janardan will play his game keeping the cops in front of him. Hello. - Sir, I know those guys who have killed Shah. Who are you? They are hidden in the Golden Club. Kiss my lips. Krishna, Krishna, say, my love. Open your inner eyes! Let the juices flow in your veins! Sway in high spirits! Just listen to me! Keep puffing! Keep puffing! Keep puffing! Keep puffing! Krishna, Krishna, say, my love. Open your inner eyes! Let the juices flow in your veins! Just listen to me! Keep puffing! Keep puffing! Let the world say anything. Let the world say anything. Do not worry. Enjoy yourself and do not sigh in desire. The more the bad name.. ..the more is the fame. Relief comes from the feeling of pain. All his works will be done successfully. Listen to me. Keep puffing! Keep puffing! Keep puffing! Keep puffing! Kiss my lips. With the heat of desires.. With the heat of desires, the youth comes. The one, who doesn't enjoy this, repents all his life. Life of a man can't be trusted. Thus leave all your attachments of life! This moment you've of happiness, enjoy it. Listen to me. Keep puffing! Krishna, Krishna, say, my love. Open your inner eyes! Let the juices flow in your veins! Sway in high spirits! Just listen to me! Keep puffing! Keep puffing! Keep puffing! Keep puffing! Keep puffing! Keep puffing! Keep puffing! Keep puffing! Let's go. I am giving you half an hour. Think and tell me. Will you give your statement here or in the hospital? Inspector, I keep people like you in my pocket. Vikram, what are you doing? Cool down, Cool down, I say. Behave yourself. By apprehending these people you have done a big job, Vikram. By killing Shah openly they tried to mock the police. After their confession, the curtain will lift from this crime.. ..and very soon we will be able to crush this mafia. Now only they should speak! I can get their mouths to open up, anytime, sir. I'll thrash them so much that they will dissociate from crime, forever. The honesty and enthusiasm, that I see in you, for your job.. ..it makes me proud of you! - Thank you, sir. Just keep your anger in control. You know that you are not a mere junior to me.. ..but something else too. I understand, sir. I am not enjoying it. Just show some hands. Massage hard. I will make your life! C'mon. Chiman Bhai, we are here to discuss. That Inspector, who arrested two of our men.. I heard, they have arrested the two boys who killed Shah.. ..I heard. Brought from the factory. Show me. - But due to these boys, what problems will crop up in future.. ..that we have to think, right? ..come to know that these were the boys who killed Shah? Chiman Bhai, if you don't feel bad, shall I say something? - Say. The police have been informed by one of your men. Lokhande, Chiman Bhai does not keep chameleons in this gang. Don't say something incorrect. This is definitely the handiwork of our enemies. One minute. This problem erupted after Shah's death, right? Who did Shah give his financial support to? The J Company. Janardan! If Shah is killed then who will feel the heat? Janardhan. - Right. But Chiman Bhai, he is in jail, you mean from jail.. He is a bastard! When he was in his mother's womb.. ..he was planning his first wedding night. What is this nonsense about his being in jail? His men only informed about our guys. Saw, the same game which I was afraid of has started. First only I was saying that enmity with Janardhan is not good. Now we don't know what turn this game takes in future! Chiman Bhai, Janardhan is not an ordinary person. If he is not ordinary then we aren't insects either. Rascal, creating bad omen! Chiman Bhai he.. I gave him a warning earlier too. While discussing something good.. ..he shouldn't create a bad omen. Throw him out. Osman Bhai's call! - Sit..sit. Yes Osman Bhai, greetings. Won't we trust for a few millions in relation and friendship? The goods will reach you. Do not worry. Osman Bhai, in my factory, my men have made some pistols. Yes, so I am sending you 5 - 10 pieces. No, they are fine. I have just used one. Jerk is also less and so is the noise. Fine, I will send you some. Okay. Once he takes them on remand, it would create all problems.. Only if he could take them on remand! What's happening here? They've been granted bail. See the papers. Release them. Oh! So you have brought their bail papers? - Yes. Very good, what will you drink, tea, coffee or cold drink? No nothing, I saw you and my stomach is full. Chimanbhai Kathiawadi is my name! My name is among the few decent people of Mumbai city. I have heard your name too, that you are very strict. But how much time will we hear each other's name and do.. ..our work, so I thought I see you today. This helps in creating a better understanding later on, right? To understand you, I do not have to listen to your rubbish. When you abuse Gujarati people, you know what they think? They think the other person gave something and didn't take. Say whatever you wish to say. Now Chiman Bhai, it's like this that I am also very much.. ..bound by law, otherwise I would show you everything.. ..Gujarati, Marathi etc. That you can do later. Right now you see the court papers. C'mon, sign here. Have you come to police station for the first time? And these two boys are not hooligans, they work in my factory. When Shah was killed, these two were on duty. The reason I am telling you this is the next time before laying.. ..your hands on my boys, bring solid evidence with you. Show me whether you have done your homework or not. Yes, we have done. Bunty, you show too. Brother, you have come. Good day, brother. Sister, what happened to brother? Brother is angry and has gone to sleep. Brother, don't act. See, the children are calling. Brother, please come. Don't break their hearts, please come. Come, we'll take the children out. Please come, please. - Let's go. Silence. Kids, please come. Please come. Come. Quiet..quiet.. I am not taking you all out. We want to go out to play. - Quiet. You'll sit here and study. I will go and bring icecream for you all. Okay? Yeah! Ice-cream! Ice-cream! Ice-cream! Shucks! The car had to break down here only! No doing any nonsense, you must do what I am saying. I am your husband you are my husband. The root of the problem is we have no children. Had been someone else, I would've had 4 children at least. Tell you father, he was after me for marriage, donkey. Dare not say donkey to my father. Will say many times, donkey, donkey, donkey! I am giving you the last warning, otherwise.. Otherwise what? - Otherwise what? Take. Glass broke? Oh mother! Save me. I am sorry. I am sorry. You look very sweet just like a chocolate. Dolly, she's gone. Thank you, thank you very much. I am dead, she broke it. The girl broke the glass and went and you didn't say anything. Otherwise you keep bossing around. Now where has it disappeared? Who is afraid? Come and I will see to her! Come, come. - What does she think of herself? - See to her. Trying to boss around? I will just show her. Come on, apply more strength! - You too help me. Okay. - Help me. Come on. - Come out. Come out. Yes. Come on. - Come on. Let's go. Oh God! Oh God! Come. Oh God! Look at that. Come on. Hurry up. Wait. - Girl, stand there only. See in our house, besides this there's nothing. Break this too. Do me a favor. Break his head too. - Here. What's the use of breaking a head without brains? Right, first time in life someone has spoken the truth. Shucks! My shoes are spoilt! I will give you one, rascal! Had come to buy ice cream for kids, don't know where I got stuck. Where should I keep them? Here. Hey. My shoe! Stop! My shoe! Hey girl! My shoe! Stop! My shoe! Wait.. Shortcut. Where did she go? Hey, my shoe! Wait..stop, my shoe! Stop! Hey girl! Now, what else happened? Oh, my shoe. I don't know whose face I saw early in the morning! What is left in this car? Hey mister. What is it? What is your life's problem? I was screaming to stop the car but you were not stopping it. See the way I am sweating! - Why should I stop? Because my shoe is kept on your car. Which shoe? - Look at this. This shoe, this dirty shoe, how did it come atop my car? How did the shoe come atop your car? Look this is a very tragic story. I was coming walking from there. I don't want to hear your tragic story. Remove this shoe. - Try to understand me. Remove this shoe. - I was coming walking from there.. ..and I stepped on tar. I was trying to walk but could not. Why are you looking like this? Remove the shoe. If you move aside, then only I can remove the shoe. - Why? Otherwise this time I will fall on you. Shut up. If I made any mistake then forgive me. People like you should be handed over to the police. So you will hand me over to the police?! Right. Will you complain against me? Right. Will you get me inside? - Right. Okay, he's come. Good, you have come here only. See, this man has troubled me a lot, put him inside. Sir, shall I put this girl inside? Oh no, you go, you go. - Okay. I am known as inspector Vikram Singh. Are you an inspector? Yes, I am an inspector. If I would've told you earlier, you wouldn't have fallen on me. Shut up. See, you are wonderful! If you would have informed me then I would come to the airport. I have not come by plane. I would've come to the station. I haven't come by train also. Then? I have come in my personal car, that too all alone. Special style, you know. What? - Yes. What? Jaipur to Bombay by road? That too all alone. And drove yourself? I don't understand anything. What is there to understand in this? What happened? If I hadn't made this trip, how could I have seen a new world? And then how could I have met him! Who is this 'Him'? He is someone, loving, handsome.. Stop here. Take this. - 75 paise more. 75 paise? I don't have the change. Do you have? - No.. From where shall I bring? All the shops are closed. You are here. - I had come to spend holidays with my friends. Do you have 75 paise? Yes, I have 75 paise! Good, the work is done. Here, take. Thank you. This meeting of ours is great. Our last meeting was also great, you remember.. ..you on top of me, I below you. Yes I remember. You did not tell me your name. - Divya. Hi! My 75 paise. - Oh, I forgot. You forgot! - I'm so sorry. Oh God, I don't have any change. So to find change is difficult. You keep this. I want my 75 paise! I don't have change that's why the auto man was waiting here I want my 75 paise. I am an honest Police Officer. How much money I gave that much I take back. I understand that but I don't have change so you keep this. That's your problem. I really don't mind. It's really okay with me. Do you think I'm some waiter or bearer that.. ..you are giving me a tip asking me to keep the change. Funny person you are! - Funny person? Am I a funny person? You called me funny? You are getting me all wrong. See you return my 75 paise. I am asking for my money. Don't show me all big notes. - It's not a big deal. What do you think of yourself? I am giving your money back. - I am asking for my money. Shut up, shut up. You return my money. My 75 paise.. Okay, you wait here only, keep quiet. Go. I am going. Bring and come. I'll give you your 75 paise! See, don't let that man come inside. You can't go inside. Why? - Security reason. Security reason. I can stand on the road and scream, can't I? - Your wish. Thank you. What is it? What do you want? Give three quarters! Give three quarters! 75 paise! Give three quarters! Give three quarters! 75 paise! From when I am waiting! Don't extend the issue! Don't enter into a brawl! Don't enter into a scuffle! Give three quarters! Give three quarters! 75 paise! Give three quarters! Give three quarters! 75 paise! How can you go like this? Remove the money quickly. All the old people and boys are looking at you. Don't be coquettish. Say something. Tell me your decision. Don't put up an act! Don't enter into a brawl! Don't enter into a scuffle! Give three quarters! Give three quarters! 75 paise! Give three quarters! Give three quarters! 75 paise! Have seen many like you. How do I trust you? You are very clear You are a smart girl. Don't go upon getting angry. Don't go after robbing me. Give me my stuff. Don't put up an act! Don't enter into a brawl! Don't enter into a scuffle! Give three quarters! Give three quarters! 75 paise! Give three quarters! Give three quarters! 75 paise! Give three quarters! Give three quarters! 75 paise! Give three quarters! Give three quarters! 75 paise! Give three quarters! Give three quarters! 75 paise! Give three quarters! Give three quarters! 75 paise! Give three quarters! What is this? I love you. She agreed. Your doubt was right. This is Janardhan's dog.. He has given the information to police. Please forgive, me Chiman Bhai. See I told you, my brother Janardhan is sitting in the jail.. ..and doing a favour on me. It is not only in your politics that a double cross happens.. In our business too, the same thing happens. Munna, how is your boss? How is his health inside the jail? He's fine. You are always in a mood to kill people! He is talking eye to eye. That too with Chiman Bhai! I will kill him. Chiman bhai, hand this job over to me. When will your friendship with the police be put to use? Mother swear, I will finish him off in an encounter. By killing, the matter will not improve, infact will get worse. Chiman, see to increase the enemity with Janardhan.. So what should I do, send a box of sweetmeat to him? According to my opinion, talk to Janardhan once, if he.. ..agrees that he is not going to give us losses, then we will.. ..forget what has happened. I know that bastard's son very well. Nothing will happen. What's it? See brother, whatever happened, we must forget.. ..and shake hands and compromise. Tell Chiman that Janardhan doesn't compromise with the enemy. He removes him from the roots.. I knew it, I knew it! That minister talks all rubbish! I have been humiliated, haven't I? ..Chiman Bhai has sent a man for compromise! You fool. One and a half hour has passed. No consideration of time! Just don't know how such people do a police job? Oh God! Let him come, I will teach him such a lesson! Oh God! I don't believe this. Vikram, today you are going to get thrashed! Sorry, I am one and half hour late. I had to go to the Commissioner with a file. After that I went home, had a bath and came here. See, I didn't comb my hair even. - It's okay. It's okay. I understand your problems very well. What's there if I had to wait a little, its all right. You understand? Of course. You are not angry at me? I am not like those foolish girls who get angry at.. ..every small thing. It's okay. I don't believe it. You are so nice, see what I have brought for you. That's so sweet! Thanks. Divya, do you know the colour of this flower.. ..is absolutely pale in your comparison. Really? - Really! You look very tired, drink something. Fell down. I'll just make a phonecall and come. - Fine. Listen, the boy sitting there has thrown a flower at me and.. ..he is laughing too. That boy? - Yes, see. Threw a flower? - Yes. What's the matter? Have you become too young? Why are you teasing other people's wives? What happened, Sardarji? What happened!? You threw a flower at my wife or not? I threw!? I just managed to avoid a thrashing by my wife - to - be! Where is your wife-to-be? There she is. Divya. Divya. Come I'll introduce her to you. Tell these people that you are with me. Divya. Divya, tell them. Who are you? I did not recognize you. He says you are his wife - to - be! Wife? Looks like he's gone crazy. Divya, what are you saying? Listen, you teach him a lesson and break his bones. My name is Mahinder Singh Shera from Patiala. I've been a Punjab Wrestling Champion. You teased my wife!? Sardarji, see, don't move. Try and understand. She is my wife. Don't do this! Try to understand! - I won't spare you. Divya, tell him. He will hit me. Easy. - Stop. Look, ask sister that I had not thrown it at her! Stop! You are under oath of Patiala! Don't come behind me. Oh my God! - Divya, I will deal with you! I won't spare you! Run! - Stop! Hey big Hooligan, escaped! Punjab Kesari's wife, he is teasing! What your wife!? I'll tease your father, I'll tease your family! Catch me if you can. The heart is crazy! The heart is crazy! The heart is crazy! The heart is crazy! Wishes are flowing! Weather is romantic! Come in my arms, come, O come. In your love! Like in the fights. You have troubled me so much. I was naïve and innocent. You had not told me anything. Just forget whatever happened before. Punish me as you wish. Just see how ignorant he acts! See how he is making me suffer. The heart is crazy! Wishes are flowing! Weather is romantic! Come in my arms, come, O come. Come, I will take you in my arms. You will never be angry, promise me! Rob me from myself, O dear! Write with your lips, now this love story. You are my flame, I am the kite. The heart is crazy! The heart is crazy! Wishes are flowing! Weather is romantic! Come in my arms, come, O come. Sir, your tea. Someone gave this letter for you. Weapons' Factory, Null Bazar, 3rd Lane. This is too much. First cut that inspector and put him in the well. No, Chiman Bhai, we must not put our hands on him now. All of us can get stuck. He is not alone. Good thought in bad times is to deal with Janardan first. He must have given the information to the police. Chiman Bhai, in my opinion, this matter. No, I don't want your opinion, don't even talk about your experience. See Chiman Bhai, talk softly to me. Now whatever has to be done about this.. ..we must discuss it among ourselves. See, see, this discussion and solving problems by talking etc.. ..it all takes place in the Parliament. Here, everything is instant! He has given me a loss of crores. Since so many days I am demanding to finish off that Janardan! Even a small connection with this matter.. See this party problem is yours. I supported you, not your party. Fine, now what has to be done? What has to be done? Have to put some of my men in the jail.. ..and inside itself we have to finish him off. No, no, this method is absolutely wrong, the matter.. ..can get complicated, your men can get caught in jail. Chiman Bhai, Bad Time, good thoughts. Yes, you speak. I am fed up with this political person! Suppose we bring Janardhan out of the jail? I mean we convince the warden to bring Janardan out..then? This is good! This is good! What will happen? Poor government officer will also.. ..get some work. He will get some money too. Call both of them to the Minister's farmhouse, to meet.. My farmhouse!? Come on children, go. Go and sit in the the bus. Aarti, come back soon from picnic. - Yes Brother. Shall I leave? - Okay. Bye. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Sister, I made fries for kids. Just see how they are! They are good. Dear, did they like your fries? They liked a lot, you go quickly to the market and.. ..bring the foodstuff. - Okay. You take care of the children. - Yes, yes Oh my kite. There it is. - I will climb the trees and remove it. Okay..fine. Look Janardhan, Shah is dead now, he cannot come back to life! Then by continuing with this enmity.. ..and putting each other in losses, what will we achieve? Mr. Minister, Chiman had killed Shah and broken my one leg. Without compensating the damages, I won't agree to any handshake! Sir, please settle this matter quickly. I have only one hour. I have brought him here on the.. ..pretext of taking him to the hospital. Jeevan. - Yes. - If anything goes wrong, my job will be gone. Janardhan Brother, come here, come here in the shade. He has taken a lot of risk in fixing up this meeting. Remove all the bitterness from inside and drink this sweet. You have tied the knot of enmity so tight that to open.. ..it now is impossible. The game you have started with.. ..Shah's murder I have to bring it to an end. What's happened, forget it. Take care of what is left. I will not forget it. ..Chiman Bhai would've gone back to his native village as a pauper!? I am not afraid of your threats! What have you done, Chiman Bhai!? Keep quiet, don't eat my brains! I trusted you. You killed him and got me trapped! What was the use of killing him? I am telling the truth, Chiman Bhai. I will not spare you all. I will hand you over to the police! Listen Sharma, this way the matter will become worse. Whatever happened has happened. Forget it. How can I forget it? How? - Leave me. Hey Sharma, you are not going anywhere. No need to get so heated up. Some solution for this will come out. I have been told this meeting is for discussions. But you killed him. Deceived me! You are killers! Oh, this is the same minister who comes to our school. Minister has killed two people! Two people he has killed! They have identified me, Chiman Bhai! Identified me! Come come, we'll go and tell sister. They ran away. Chiman Bhai, do something. They are children, what will they say? What children!? They have recognized me. I had gone to their school. Two murders were committed on my farmhouse! Come. Sister, one policeman and one man have been murdered. Yes sister, the minister was also there, who had.. ..come to our school and given me a prize. They have told their teacher also. That Minister Jagat Narayan? - Yes sister. By tomorrow this news will be spread in the city like fire. My chair is gone. Your lives will also be ruined. This is no more restricted to kids. They have told that girl too. She will tell the police. Sister, we are afraid. Children, run! Run! Hey Vilaiti, bring weapons. Come inside. Come here. Children, lie down, lie down. Quick! Lie down. Quick! Run! Come on children, food is ready. Who is this Anjali? Hey Vilaiti, catch her. Oh Chiman Bhai, she has seen us killing the children. If she tells them, then we will die, we will get destroyed! Oh, shut up. Hello. What? Oh, my child. My son! I am badly stuck Chiman Bhai. ..to go there. Anjali must have met the police already. What if she recognizes me? The girl got a bullet in her leg, right? If she is alive, she will.. ..go to the City hospital, won't she? But, I don't want to go there. No, no, you must not be afraid, you are a Public Servant.. ..people's sorrow you must share! First make them cry and then wipe the tears. But, but, Chiman Bhai. Put ifs and buts in some hole! Go and see what the police are doing. For the public keep a tear in the eye and for the police.. ..keep your ears open. Go and be victorious! Go. See minister sahib, our children have been killed so mercilessly. This accident has shaken everyone. Even I am not less sorry. Move back! Move back! Mr. Minister, the court and the law will not punish these killers. We will mete out punishment to them. They should get much more severe punishment than simply getting hanged! Any information, commissioner? Any clue of those killers? I want fast progress in this case. The deftness with which they have done this job.. ..it seems they are professional criminals. And the most difficult thing is that, sir.. ..there is no eyewitness to this incident. Anjali! Anjali! - Anjali! Anjali! Let me go! Anjali! My daughter! Let them come. Let me go! Let me go! Sir, my daughter Anjali was with these children. Anjali. - Anjali. Anjali. My child. Listen to me. - Anjali. Listen to me. - She is my child. But who are you? I'm the caretaker of the place where these kids had come for a picnic. My daughter had arranged for their food, sir. Listen..listen to me. Try to understand what I am saying. - She was with them. What was your daughter's age? Twenty! Twenty? - Yes. No girl of this age is among these. - What? You keep patience, keep patience. But why will they take that girl? No such motive can be seen behind this massacre! It's possible, that the girl has run away. If it's like that, then that girl can recognize those people. My daughter is no where. You just keep patience, everything will be all right. Your Anjali will be found. Can you tell how does your daughter look? There is no photograph, but she is fair. Very good looking. My lovely daughter is soft like a flower. She is nowhere. Everything will be all right. Please sit there. Ashok. - Sir. Search the entire area. She must be somewhere. Go. Sharma. - Yes, sir. Bring all the well known hooligans to me. - Okay sir. Listen, you were in Goa? Yes sir. When did you come to Bombay? - Today morning, sir. Close your button, close your button. Stand here. I know that two among you.. The longer time you take.. ..the bigger will be the difficulty that you will face. Tell me who killed those innocent children? Tell me or I will finish you off. That officer, how brave he is, even you know that. In that shootout his sister was also killed. He can prove to be very dangerous to us. Yes and even her corpse couldn't be found as yet. What if she comes out alive? Here our experiences are similar. Tell me, what has to be done? The trouble is, we can't get him killed even. He is working on this.. ..case is known to even the children of this city. If something happens to him.. ..people will throw me along with my chair too. Oh yes, when will Lokhande be of use to us? Don't worry, your work will be done. Those kids who don't know Vikram as yet.. ..will also come to know of him by tomorrow. A man of law should be trapped by law only, right? It will be done, Chiman Bhai. It will be done. Leave that to me. Listen. - Yes. In which lockup has Vikram kept all those whom he had arrested? Okay sir. During interrogation, who was there with Vikram? None of us were there, sir. Actually inspector Vikram said that he did not require anyone. He alone interrogated them. Inspector, call the ambulance and send the bodies for postmortem. Sir. Lokhande, take everyone's statement. - Yes, sir. I know you are innocent but the way you have thrashed them! Sir I..- Duty officers are the witness to this. Do you have any evidence to save your skin? Do you have any evidence? Now it is more necessary to get some evidence against those killers. Only after they are caught, can this conspiracy be busted. My advice is, don't invite any bigger trouble. I am trying my best to find Anjali out. Understood it well? Sir. Our people are searching that girl in the jungle? - Yes. Hence check all the cars properly before letting them pass. Okay sir. I want police..police! I am the police. What happened? I am Anjali, they killed the children. Killed them. Who were they? Do you know their names? No. If you see them, will you recognize them? - Yes. See Anjali, nothing will happen to you, don't worry. Come on. Get in. Don't worry, don't worry, Anjali. Everything will be all right. Nothing will happen to you. See the hospital has come, try to remain conscious. Try to remain conscious, try to remain conscious. Listen to me. Anjali! Divya.. I know you are also thinking wrong about.. I don't want to listen to anything nor do I want to say anything. Oh God who has come! Ghost! Ghost! Ghost! Dingdong, sing a song. Dingdong, sing a song. We got scared? Come and face us. Dingdong, sing a song. Dance! Laugh! Smile! This is the occasion, enjoy! Dingdong, sing a song. Dance! Laugh! Smile! This is the occasion, enjoy! Watch this. In the lanes and roads, in the arms of fun. In the lanes and roads, in the arms of fun. We will dance and sing, we crazy people. In the fair of colors or all alone. This world will watch us in amazement! Everyone loves us. It is better than both the world. Our heart is still innocent. There is no one like us. Dingdong, sing a song. Dingdong, sing a song. Dance! Laugh! Smile! This is the occasion, enjoy! Hey you! Whatever we wish to do, we will do and show it to the world! Be it a heroine or a hero! They all appear to us as zeros! Be it a leader or a hero! They all appear to us as zeros! This is our world! This is our song! We dream for a golden tomorrow, that is ours. We will walk on swords. We will walk on fire. But we will not break this friendship. We will not leave each others' side. The whole world will see this. Dingdong, sing a song. Dingdong, sing a song. Dance! Laugh! Smile! This is the occasion, enjoy! Dingdong, sing a song. Dance! Laugh! Smile! This is the occasion, enjoy! Dance! Laugh! Smile! Vikram. ..this place is no good. Hey, why are you creating a ruckus? Listen. - Yes sir. Stand straight. - Yes sir. Sir, why have you called me here? All this was happening with you and I was helpless. I was surrounded by the boundaries of the law. But now I want to come out of the boundaries and fight. I have only one goal. Sir, did you get any information about them? The caretaker's daughter whom we were searching for.. ..I found her in an injured state. Our doubt was right. She had seen children being killed with her eyes. She could recognize the killers. And due to that fear, they fired at her too. May I meet her once, sir? I will kill those rogues, sir. I will literally kill.. That girl is dead. Anjali died? Anjali died..she died! - Vikram. Sorry sir. Vikram, I have thought of a plan. That Anjali is dead is known to me.. ..Anjali's parents and now to you. Anjali is still a threat to those killers. They're still in her search. That's why we will keep Anjali alive. And we will spread the news that the police have found her. Has the Commissioner sir explained everything to you? Yes. What have you thought? What is there to think in this? I am ready. Divya, you know this is a very dangerous work. - I know. Your life may also go in this. - I know. I have no fear. I am now at Anjali's place. Saw, that girl is gone in the hands of the police? As soon as she regains consciousness, she'll tell everything. That is true! If the operation is done and she'll surely.. ..regain her consciousness. Then she will surely open her.. ..mouth and if she opens her mouth we are finished. To kill that girl in the hospital is not an easy job. What do you think to kill her will I send my own men? Will I make such a mistake. The minister do this work? Me? Come I will explain to you, come. You can go to see her. You are the minister. She is your subject. With a goodwill gesture our job will also be done. Sir, come. Please come. Constable, accompany him. I want to go to the bathroom, please check it. - Yes. Go outside! - What happened? - Go outside. Sir. What's the position? Arrangements for the operations have been made. Senior Dr. Patel is just going to come here. As soon as he comes, Anjali will be taken to the operation theatre. Yes, sir. Definitely. Friends.. ..you all know that Anjali's life.. how important it is for us. To know about those killers, she is the only witness that we have. This news must've reached them as well. And they must also be trying to kill her.. See, there should be no laxity in the security here. She's the only one who can help us reach those killers. Hey, stop! If my foot moves from this pedal, this girl will die for sure. All others will also die. - No..no. Move out of my way. - Yes, Yes. Move back, move. As soon as she is conscious inform me. She should give her statement in front of me. Yes sir. I have put a bomb on this girl. Tell your police officers to move out of my way. Go back, everyone go back, everyone go back. Sir, please. Go back. Sir, please listen to me and go from here. Please sir, I request you. I am requesting you to go from here. Please, please, I request you. You people be with him. Hey! I am telling you the whole hospital will blast. You all will die, this girl, this Anjali will also get killed. If my foot is lifted from this pedal, the bomb will blast. In one way it has been good and if has been bad too. What good has happened? That inspector searching for killers of his sister and children. That means he's looking for us ..and now they have that girl who recognizes us. What's good in that? See Mr. Jagat Narayan, the police knows means the public knows. Police we can handle, public we cannot. Now he has become an enemy to the law. Now he will try to fight with us alone or not? See Chiman Bhai, what use is it to wait for the enemy to attack? Spread your net all over the city and kill both of them. Yes, this is what I am saying from the beginning. And at such times you too take advantage of your chair. Call the Commissioner and tell him to give you every report of Vikram.. As soon as we get a hint of his hideout.. ..we will reach there before the police and will finish him off. Now go and make the phone call. Hello Commissioner, I am Jagat Narayan speaking. What is your police doing? Why have you not found out anything about Vikram and that girl? Sir, we are trying to trace them out. Do not worry. What? Such a big incident has taken place and.. ..you are telling me not to worry. Do you have any idea that how.. ..much anger is there in people's heart? See the arrest of that inspector and the safety of that girl. I want the report of all your progress about these matters. For my selfish reasons.. Nothing will happen to you. Divya, I love you. I love you. I will not let anything happen to you. Divya, I love you. I love you. Sweetheart, come I will give you love. Sweetheart, come I will give you love. I'll keep you in my heart and love you only! Give my life for you. Sweetheart, come I will give you love. I have become a madcap! - Don't love me so much! Look in my eyes! - So much love is hidden! I have become a madcap! - Don't love me so much! Come I will take you in my arm.. ..play with your lips and make up your tresses! My love, your image is more loving than God. Sweetheart, come I will give you love. Now the shades are same. - Of our dreams. Now the shades are same. - Of our dreams. My love, this life of mine, this heartbeat is your sign. Sweetheart, on my lips is only your tale, all the time. Sweetheart, come I will give you love. Sweetheart, come I will give you love. Keep you in my heart and love you only. Give my life for you. Our this plan has forced them to take this step.. ..but they are cunning and clever. Sir, this shows their fear. Don't know whether they will commit the mistake of.. ..coming out in the open or not! Since fear in them will make them commit a mistake. And their mistake will be our victory. Now they must know our address so that they try to kill us. For that I must go to joints where illegal trade is carried out. Like red - light areas, liquor joints, gambling dens, etc. Since they usually frequent these areas.. ..if anyone spots me our work will be done. Divya.. ..nothing can happen! Nothing. Everything was planned properly. Even put your life in danger but nothing happened. We thought that we will take you out from the hospital.. ..so that they will follow and attack us.. ..that they will try to kill us, but nothing happened. Until they take any action what can we do? Vikram, you cannot torture yourself like this. What can I do? What can I do? Those small kids were my friends. I used to play with them. My sister used to teach them. Hello. Listen Lokhande, my boys have found out the place where they both are. Take your men and finish them off. What happened? Everything will be fine. "I am lonely, beloved. You are also lonely, beloved." "I am lonely, beloved. You are also lonely, beloved." "I am lonely, beloved. You are also lonely, beloved." "All vows break at such a time." "I am lonely, beloved. You are also lonely, beloved." "The marvel of the lovely night is torturous." "I am lonely, beloved. You are also lonely, beloved." "I am lonely, beloved. You are also lonely, beloved." "My breaths are hot." "Make an attempt." "Eyes are mischievous." "My body is smoldering." "My breaths are hot." "Make an attempt." "Eyes are mischievous." "Wonder what intoxication is this." "Let us err." "Wonder what intoxication is this." "Let us err." "I think this fervor won't ebb." "I am lonely, beloved." "You are also lonely, beloved." "I am lonely, beloved. You are also lonely, beloved." Hello. Listen Lokhande, my boys have found out the place where they both are. Take your men and finish them off. "My beloved." "Take me in your arms." "What desires are these!" "Play with danger." "My beloved." "What desires are these!" "Play with danger." "Tease me a little." "Relish the youth." "Tease me a little." "Relish the youth." "Have a close look. Don't be heartless." "I am lonely, beloved. You are also lonely, beloved." "I am lonely, beloved. You are also lonely, beloved." "The marvel of the lovely night is torturous." "I am lonely, beloved. You are also lonely, beloved." "I am lonely, beloved. You are also lonely, beloved." This..why has this police come here? Vikram ,come out in the open! Fast.. ..or else I'll shoot this girl. Come on. Fast. On whose action do you want to kill us? Who has sent you? Police wants Anjali alive, then why did you shoot? Speak up. Who wants us dead? Who wants us dead? Speak up. Even if you lose your consciousness a 100 times, still.. ..I will bring you back into consciousness and will ask you.. ..only one question, who wants us dead? Speak up! Lokhande, death is here also and there too. Better commit suicide. Jump from the window. Leave me Vikram. - No. Who were they? Let me die. - Tell me, who were they? Tell me. No! No! No! No! With great difficulty we found one man and he also died. Now don't know rest of them will come in front of us or not. - Vikram. Vikram, please. Please. Lokhande is killed. What is happening, Commissioner? Only for one Vikram, your police force is falling short? Lokhande didn't give me any information about this operation. You are the Police Commissioner of this city. And you are not in the know of anything!? In the hospital, under your security Vikram took away Anjali. Today he killed Lokhande. Tomorrow he will kill me. Do anything. Deploy your men all over the city.. .and kill them wherever they are spotted. But we want Anjali alive, sir? Yes, yes, when will we get her alive? We are trying our level best. First of all the minister knew Lokhande very well. When he saw Lokhande's body he was afraid.. ..as if his own life was in danger. Afterwards, in nervousness he threatened to kill Anjali and you. One minute, when in the hospital they tried to kill Divya. That means, that the minister is also involved with those killers.. ..and he had sent Lokhande to kill us. Sir, Divya is correct. This minister is also one among those killers. We've to do something immediately.. ..otherwise they will find many avenues to escape. This time we cannot do anything against the minister. Because we don't have any evidence. And we know one thing that there are other people.. ..who are involved in the massacre. And the minister is the way to reach him. And now we have to think as to how to use this minister. Sir, we will one thing. Hi. Sorry minister, I disturbed you in this place. Help! Someone help! Police! No..no.. You bastard, you have killed those children. Let go of me, leave me, you bastard. Sir, you don't know, he is the man.. ..who had killed those innocent children. See, the crime has to be decided by the law and the court. Take him away. Yes. Take me. You can't harm me. I won't spare this man and his accomplices. I won't. I won't spare them. Sir, fear and the color of your face shows me.. ..that what Vikram says is the truth. And the trouble in which this truth can put you and.. ..and your accomplices is very well known to you. For you and all your accomplices.. ..if you want.. ..I have a solution to come out of this problem. How much money do you want? 10 lakhs, 20 lakhs? 50 lakhs! I want 50 lakhs for this work. I agree for this amount.. ..but give us Anjali's information and hand her over to us.. ..and also that Vikram.. I will kill him in the lockup itself. I understood. But Vikram will not disclose about Anjali easily. He'll definitely tell. Just watch. Speak up, where is Anjali? - I won't tell. Tell us, where is the girl, inspector Vikram. By being silent why do you want to give away your life? Tell us about that girl. I will not die. My life will not go so easily. Before dying.. ..I want to do some good work. Very tough! When he regains consciousness, thrash him again. Then only will he tell where the girl is. I am saying it again. This was the girl who was in the hospital. One minute..one minute. You mean to say that the girl.. This can happen, what's a big deal in it? I can't understand that for the girl for whom Vikram is being thrashed.. ..the same girl comes to meet Vikram in the lockup! Why are you pressurizing your mind? Oh, you confused me too! We'll go point by point. When Vikram attacked you, who came to save you? Commissioner. How did he come to know that Vikram was going to attack you? Means Commissioner knew that Vikram was going to attack you. Who will come to know such secrets? But how did you come to know? You know when Commissioner saved you, it struck in my mind. I asked two men to follow him. As the commissioner will meet the girl.. ..and this will be known to my men to. Then we would pick up the girl. Simple! Hello. Commissioner, uncle. - What happened to you? Commissioner, uncle. Divya. Come on. Hello. Divya. Divya. Hello. So commissioner, got bowled over? This happens when you play a game! Who are you? - If you want the girl alive, do one thing. My man is there beside you. Catch hold of his finger and come wherever he brings you. If anything happens to that girl.. You come here and we'll clear everything sitting face to face. Come here and we'll settle. Bye. Moron. Smile now. The girl is also reached there and I spoke to the Commissioner as well. This colorful program shall be at your farmhouse only. But..- No ifs and buts! Do only what I ask you to do. Nothing can be said about you people. If things go out of hand, you will give a letter of consent. You'll change your party. The main issue is left. The doctor which operated on.. ..the girl, we've to call him too. And the parents of that girl. We have to call them as well. Brother, my work is over. Killing Vikram in the jail is your duty. Who sent you? Who sent you? Jagat Narayan and Chimanbhai. Come. Come. He is the real man! Come. Come. What a game! What a game he has played. Isn't it? And we thought we are the only bastards. But, you, a gentleman, how did you thought of all this? Great! Had you been in our gang, you would've reached places. When he didn't use the law, he used the brain! You shot at her! He played a great trick! That girl was dead, still he spread the rumor that she is alive. So that we have to come out to finish her off. Secondly, when the minister went to kill her in the hospital.. ..you shifted her from the hospital, with Vikram's help. I can't understand from where to start breaking your bones! But one salute is due to this baby too.. ..that she was ready to receive bullets upon the commissioner.. ..asking her to do so! So all this drama was to reach us, right? They wanted to meet the killers of the children. Now your wish is fulfilled, right? You have seen me, right? All this was done by me. Everything was done by me. And this minister too. He was helpless as he wanted to save his prestige. Her sister-in-law, Vikram's sister, we had to kill her as well. And that fellow.. your honest inspector.. ..we got him trapped, got his suspended too.. ..but did he reform his ways? Finally we got him killed in the jail! What? So what else could I do? Even I was staring at the gallows! I too was helpless. But now everything is clear! Everything is clear. ..all the accessories are here only. I'll just see. One by one, I'll tackle them! Give that to me. Throw away your weapons. Move back! You are a bastard.. ..that was known to me. But you will reach such limits of bestiality.. ..was not known to me. Didn't your hands shiver committing such a heinous crime? If not the police and the law.. ..you should've been scared of that God, the Almighty! This is Jagat Narayan speaking. Send a helicopter at my farm house, immediately. Ran away! Let go of me! Leave me. Get inside. Leave me. Where are you taking me? - Sit quietly. What are you doing? - What happened? You know who that guy is? He is the man who killed hundreds of children! And you are helping him!? What are you saying? - I am speaking the truth. I won't partake in this sin. One who takes the name of the Lord is benefited! He is going there..there. Down..down! Faster! Further! Help! Help! Behind that car! There he is..there. Faster! No..no! Hurry up! Leave me. Leave it! No. Faster! That car is going towards the ditch. Divya, jump! Jump! Vikram..help! Help! Come on top! Give me your hand, Divya! Give me your hand! Yes, Divya! - Vikram.. Vikram. Up. Vikram. - Come on. Help! There he is.. running with the car. Look there. Down.. ..there that blue car..look! Help! He is thrashing him! He is thrashing him! He is thrashing him! Leave me.. let go of me! Let go of me Stop him! Stop him! Stop him! Stop him! Take him Take him Leave me! Leave me! He is the person who. ..killed those hundred kids. He is the person! Catch him! Catch him! It's mine! It's mine! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! My son, you aren't hurt, are you? Come on. Come on. Perhaps God too couldn't think of any other punishment for your sins. What punishment has God given you, seeing your crime! O God! Your justice is great! You all right? - Yes. Divya, I want to talk to you something. I need my 75 paise! 75 paise? - Yes. Even now I don't have the change! Give three quarters! Give three quarters! 75 paise! Give three quarters! Give three quarters! 75 paise! From when I am waiting! Don't show your eyes!
