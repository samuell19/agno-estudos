How is he, Doc? He's in critical condition. We recommend you take him to a hospital capable of handling this. - But we get an ambulance, right? - We'll provide it. - Excuse me. - Thanks, doctor. - I want to be in the ambulance. - Okay. Me and Nayla will follow you from behind. - Dad! - Dad! - Dad. - Hold on, Dad. Peace Be Upon You, My Future Husband How is my husband's condition? His condition is stabilizing But his body isn't ready for the operation. Moreover, we need to prepare... ...the equipment for the transplant. And there are still some things... ...that need to be tested and done. - I believe you understand. - Yes, I do. A transplantation requires preparation. We may be able to do it in 3 days. We'll do our best. That's the fastest we can do it. But as a doctor... ...I also have the obligation to inform you... ...that there's a patient with a similar case... ...with the same age as Mr. Husein. They tend to refuse the transplantation. Yes, I understand that. He himself... ...doesn't want the heart transplantation. He's not ready. - We apologize. - I understand. You may also know that it's not easy to get a heart donor. I understand. Fisya. So, you actually knew about all this? That's right. He collapsed after Jidan and Salsya's engagement meeting. I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I don't blame you for that. Mr. Alif, you're a doctor. Tell me the truth about my father's condition. Well, I don't know the latest update. But as far as I know... ...his condition is worrying. But that doesn't mean it can't be treated. But he's going to be okay, right? God willing. It all goes back to God's will. This one is good to be printed on canvas. That's right. The other one is also good. Right, Dan? Dan? Yeah? What's wrong with you? You look anxious. Where's Fisya? I don't see her. She's also not answering her phone. Where's Aunt Mia? I haven't seen her. I'll go look for her. Maybe she's somewhere less crowded. Ouch! I told you not to touch it, or you'll get hurt. You're right, Dan. It hurts. Dan? Are you okay? Dan? What are you thinking about? Nothing. Have you seen Fisya? I saw her earlier, but not now. Dan? You're Salsya's husband now. - What do you mean? - You understand what I mean. Why are you looking for another girl? Your status is clear now. I'm not looking for her without a reason. She really is missing. But she's in your heart, right? Congrats. Sorry I was late. Better late than never, right? Why're you using English? Hey. You want to chase her? Be careful, you'll get beaten up. Creature from Mars: Where are you, Sya? Creature from Mars: 8 Missed Call Sis Salsya: 2 Missed Call Rachel: I'm here. Where are you? Rachel: 2 Missed Call 3 Unread Messages - Fisya. - Mr. Alif. You better go inside and meet your dad. I'll accompany you. Come on. Come on. - Dad. - Sya, come here. Dad. Alif. Dad... Yeah? Don't tell your mum and your sister, okay? What about your scholarship? Have you taken it? Don't think about that now. You have to think about how you need the operation. It's better that the money for the operation... ...is used for you to live abroad. But I don't want to go abroad. I want to be here with you. I want to always be your side. Maybe I'm not destined... ...to let you go to another man. You're forever mine. Dad! But if there's the chance... ...I know to whom I will let you go. Mr. Alif. - You know where the prayer room is? - Let's go together. - Okay. - Come on. Dear Allah, it's been a while since I last talked to you. I was too arrogant to ask for your help. With all my humbleness, allow me to make a request. Dear God... ...allow me to bring happiness to my dad whom I've spent my lifetime hating. Give me the strength to be the place for him to lean on. Make me the cure for his sadness and his pain. I beg you not to take my chance to contribute to him as a daughter. If you're willing... ...please give him good health. Give us a chance to have the enjoyment of a parent and his child. The enjoyment of a family. The enjoyment of togetherness that I've ruined with hatred. Forgive me and my parents... ...love them as they have loved me when I was little. Love my dad, please, God. There's still no word from Aunt Mia? Still no word from Fisya, too. Jidan and Jiad looked for her everywhere but they didn't find her. - Peace be upon you, Nayla. - And upon you too, Mum. I'm sorry I didn't have the chance to say goodbye before I left. Oh, God. It's okay, Nay. No wonder Fisya was also missing. We were looking everywhere for you. Yes, Mum. Send my love to Salsya and Jidan. I hope their marriage is filled with happiness. Thanks, Nay. Send my love to everybody. Peace be upon you. What is it? They already said goodbye to Fisya before they left. Maybe they also said goodbye to me, but I didn't notice. - Where's Fisya, then? - Try to ask her. What's wrong? It's about Fisya? - There's no word from her yet. - You two should rest. Let me wait for her. She'll be home soon, I'm sure. Let me do it. You should rest. It's okay. Let me wait for her this once. You should rest. Go. - Just go. - Okay. Let me do it. - I think it wasn't locked. - It's okay. Anyway, where's Fisya? She's not home yet. You want to go look for her? It's not like that. This is our wedding day. Would she do this just because she hates her dad? It's a happy day for us. I don't think that's the problem. - I'll go change. - Okay. - Sya? - Yeah? Tomorrow is my first day of work. I won't be able to take a leave of absence for a year. What about our honeymoon? We don't need to go to another city for our honeymoon... ...do we? Fisya. Fisya. Mr. Alif. I fell asleep. Sorry. You better go home. It's late. Nayla already called your mum. Where are the others? Kahfa and Nayla are taking care of the hospital administration. Aunt Mia is getting clothes from her house. I'm going to be here, Dad. I want to accompany you. I'll think about an excuse to give to mum. What matters is that I'm here now. Your mum will be worried. Especially since this is right after Salsya and Jidan's wedding. But I want to be here to accompany you. Just accompany me tomorrow. Go home. Think about your mum and Salsya. And find an excuse to stay overnight here tomorrow. Okay? - Alif, please take her home. - Okay. Coincidentally, my shift is over. Your shift is really over? That's right. I don't know how I'll be able to repay your kindness. You don't need to think about it. It's okay. But you've been so nice to me. You're even taking me home this late. It's not a problem. I'm going home, okay? Thank you so much. Where have you been? Me and Salsya just got married and you disappeared. I'll explain everything to mum. Just explain it to me. - I'm the one who asked you. - Can we just talk tomorrow? You're outrageous. Your best friend, your sister... ...got married and you just went and had fun with that professor. I had something to attend to. What? A date? What's wrong with you? Where have you been? He didn't even attend the ceremony. Don't even say it's about your studies. I know it's not a busy time in college right now. Why are you like this. I went after your ceremony! I don't know what's the problem! Remember, I don't have any obligation to explain all my affairs to you! Get it? Sya! You're not lying, right? No, Mum. Why would I do that? There really was a college assignment I had to do. Mr. Alif was the one who took me home. Just ask Jidan, he saw us. Mr. Alif was going to meet you, but it was so late. Okay then. But I won't like it if you do that again. At least tell me. - Okay? - Yes, Mum. It's been a while since I saw you practising this early. You're done? You don't want to practise with me? I practise early in the morning, so I can be alone. When someone's here, it means I'm done. What do you want? You. Isn't it clear? And I don't want you. Isn't that clear? - Can you let me go? - Just try to make me let go. Let me go! Don't force someone who doesn't want you. - What are you doing here? - To practise, obviously. This is still a taekwondo hall, right? Not a place for a guy to pretend to be macho... ...who forces what he wants on a girl. You want me to defeat you again? I think it's you... ...who needs to be prepared to be defeated by me. You should get an award for the dumbest person in the world who acts all tough. He's a black belt and you're just a white belt. Okay, okay. I'll paint my belt black later. "My"? Ouch! - Why are you hitting me? - Don't be whiny. It still hurts. Chel, where have you been? You're that busy? Busy dating? Dating who? That guy. Ido. - Says who? - Ido. He said that he's your boyfriend. And you believe him? You really are stupid. I'm amazed. Jidan? What does he want? Chel, come with me. - What for? No way! - Just come. No way! It's better to come with me than being here. - Come on. - Fine. I'll go change first. Ouch! - You need my help? - No! So, how was it yesterday? Did you find her yet? Where'd she disappear to? Chel. You're Fisya's friend. Do you know what's wrong with her? You're also her friend. And also her neighbour. But I really don't know what's wrong with her. Just try to talk to her. I tried to talk to her yesterday. She got mad. Was it her who got mad? Or was it you? It was her. - I asked her nicely. - Maybe she was just tired. She just got home and wanted to rest, not to be interrogated. What's up with you? I'm curious. I just don't like how she suddenly took a scholarship abroad. As if something happened. And that professor. He makes her misbehave. She goes home late now. - I just haven't told mum and Salsya. - What's wrong with that? I don't know. I just don't like him. Especially if Fisya accepts his marriage proposal. What does that have to do with you? Whether she accepts him, she likes him, she doesn't like him... ...whether you like him or not, what does that have to do with you? - Rachel, what Jidan means... - And about studying abroad. You're so dumb that you didn't realize it. Just think. When did she sign up for this scholarship? Since you proposed to her sister, right? What does that mean? You want me to tell you? It means that she loves you... ...and she couldn't stand to see you being romantic with her sister every day. Use your brain if you have one! Are you satisfied? It's crazy. Annoying. You're the most self-centered human being I've ever met. You want the nicest and most perfect future wife. But you don't like it when someone is close to Fisya. Who do you think you are? You're in doubt? You're sad? Just swallow it! You've made your choice, right? You chose her sister, right? Then leave Fisya alone! Problem solved, right? I told you I didn't want to come! - Dan. I'm so sorry. - Yeah yeah yeah. Just go. Chel! Rachel! Chel! Rachel, you shouldn't have talked to Jidan like that. Then you should be the one talking to him. I'm so mad at him, I want to hit him! You didn't have to be that mad. Why should I hold back? He married Salsya! Why is he still thinking about Fisya? I'm so mad at him! Rachel. Love isn't as easy as you think. It's not like "one plus one equals two". It's not. I don't think it's all Jidan's fault. Fisya is also at fault here. Why is she at fault, too? What did she do? Just listen to me. If she had feelings for him, why didn't she tell him? She had a lot of chances. It's not that easy! It should be the guy who confesses, and the girl just needs to give her answer! - How dumb are you? - I already expressed my feelings for you. But you never answered, right? And you still call me dumb? Who are we talking about? We're talking about Fisya and Jidan. But I'm talking about us. - You want to talk about us? - Yes. About your proposal? I'm not a religious Muslim girl. My parents have different religions. I won't be a good wife for you. I'm not good enough for you! You still want to be with me? Are you sure? You can't answer me, can you? Dan, what are you doing here? I... ...want to talk to you. If it's about last night, I don't want to. - I already talked about it with my mum. - It's not about that. I need to talk about this ASAP, before it's too late. - Okay, only until my bike taxi arrives. - I want you to be honest with me. Is it true that you have feelings for me? - What do you mean? - I'm sure you know what I mean. Please answer me. - Who told you that? - That's not the answer. I just want to hear it from you. Even if it's true, so what? You're my brother-in-law now. - It's not like that. - Nothing can be done about it. My bike taxi just arrived. Hello? Yes, sir. This is good. You're a good cook, Salsya. You like it, Idan? I'll cook for you again, then. Too bad it's dead. I'll buy it again for you. Rachel: there only one thing you need to do now. Forget jidan. Rachel: He doesn’t love you. He loves your sister. I accept this marriage... ...with Nafisya Kayla Akbar binti Husein Akbar, with... What's wrong? You look anxious. Where's Fisya? I don't see her. She's also not answering. You two should rest. Let me wait for her. Let me do it. You should rest. - Where's Fisya? - You want to go look for her? It's not like that. It's a happy day for us. FISYA: Sis, I'm staying at a friend's house tonight. SALSYA: Have you told mum? FISYA: Not yet. Please tell her for me. Okay, take care. Mum? What's wrong? I'm okay. You're married now. You'll be a mother soon. I'm worried. Why are you suddenly like this? I'm always worried... ...that my children would be traumatized of marriage... ...because... ...their parents didn't set a good example for them. Don't worry. There's nothing to worry about. Everything will be okay. If God wills. When I first met your dad... ...he was a very nice man. Just like Jidan. It wasn't hard for me to fall in love with him. Thank God... ...both of our parents... ...gave their blessings for our relationship. But... ...when your little sister was 4 years old... ...Aunt Mia came to us. She brought a child with her. The child was 9 years older than you. She said the child was your dad's. I didn't want to be in a polygamous marriage. Mum. Your dad said... ...it was a misunderstanding. That Aunt Mia was his ex. And that it had been a long time ago... ...when he was still fooling around. But I still didn't want it. I asked for a divorce. Our life right now is all my fault. Mum. I just thought about myself who didn't want him to have another wife. But I didn't think about my children's feelings... ...who would grow up without a dad figure. He didn't want a divorce. I forced him to do it. - Calm down, Mum. - I asked him to marry her. I want you... ...to not repeat my mistakes. No matter how big ...the problems in your marriage ...divorce is not the way out. It's never the way out. The love between you and Jidan... ...becomes more complicated. You're not two kids dating anymore. You have to keep... ...your love alive. And never give up on each other. It's been a while since I last saw you pray. If you were in our house, you would see me pray often. You're lying. You only prayed when I was your Imam. Do you remember? That was back then, when I was little. It's different now. You're an adult now, so you don't want me to be your Imam? So, who do you want to be your Imam? You're so good at slipping that topic in. So, how is it with you and Alif? If you want to accept him, just do it. If you want to reject him, just do so. Don't make him wait. Take pity on him. Do you want that scholarship? Just take it. You don't need to accept his proposal. I'll explain it to your mum and Alif. I'm not thinking about those things. You may not be thinking about it. That's why I'm reminding you. I'm old, darling. If I accept his proposal... ...will it make you happy? My happiness depends on your happiness. One thing for sure, I would be at peace. What's wrong? Nothing. - I'll leave you for a while. - Where are you going? Just for a while. I'll be back, okay? Wait for a while, okay? - Here. - This one? Sir. - You go on first. - Okay. Fisya, I was just going to visit your dad. I want to ask you. Is your proposal still valid? - Stop it. Don't think... - Is it still valid? If it is... ...I will accept it. - Dad? - Yes? I always like seeing the two of you together. - How is your health today? - Thank God, I feel healthy. Where are Kahfa and Nayla? They alternately take care of their kid... ...do their job, and take care of me. - Who is that? - Peace be upon you. There he is. Kahfa. Dad. - Sya. - Hi. If I knew you were here, I wouldn't have come. My kid is being fussy right now. - Dad? - Dad? Kahfa, call the doctor! Call the others! Peace be upon you too, Fisya. What? Which hospital? Okay. I'm going there. - God, have mercy. - Who was that? Your dad collapsed. - He's in the hospital now. - Come on. Have mercy, God. Get ready. - Dad. - Fisya. Come here. - Do something, doctor. - Alif. Excuse me. Doctor, excuse me. Mr. Alif, now. Right now. - Hurry! - Okay. This is as fast as I can go. Shouldn't we wait for her mum and Salsya? What do you think, Mr. Husein? Would you be able to wait? Don't wait. Let's just start. But I don't have any mahr. Mahr or marriage dowry can be in the form of a short Qur'an verse. Okay. I... ... marry you... ...Alif Syaibani Alexis bin Saban Moe chtar... ...to my daughter... ...Nafisya Kayla Akbar binti Husein Akbar... ...with the dowry of a Qur'an verse... ...in cash. I accept this marriage... ...with Nafisya Kayla Akbar binti Husein Akbar, with the said dowry. Read it, please. This is the hardest two weeks of my life. Because you married me? He's immediately living here? You should talk about this with mum. We don't know what kind of person he is. Then just admit that you love Fisya!
