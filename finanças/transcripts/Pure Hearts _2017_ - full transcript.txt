Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop. Stand over here. Stop. Stop, stop, stop. Arms wide. Arms wide. You stole this crap? Got any ID? Got any ID? No. I need to report you, come on. - No! Come on, please... let's go. No, please! - I need to report you, come on. No, no, no! Please! No! Either you walk or I'll push you. Please... - What's it gonna be? What's it gonna be? Let me go... - Move it, come on. Let's go, please. - No! Let me go, please... - Right. Move it, come on. Let me go, please! - Yeah, yeah... Let me go, please. - Move it. Goddammit! Will you move it? I've never stolen before. Please, let me go. What the fuck do I care? Let me go, please! Please, I'm sorry! Let me go. - I have to do this. No! Please... I have to do this. I'm not a thief. - I don't give a fuck. Come on. - Let me go. Please. Please! I'm sorry... Let me go, please. Just take this and go. Go! Why the fuck are you running? Just walk. PURE HEARTS Come here, holy spirit Heavenly strength in my heart Let me be reborn, Lord Holy Spirit Like a spring Come into me Like an ocean Come into me Like a river Come into me Like an echo Come into me Come here, Holy Spirit Heavenly strength in my heart Let me be reborn, Lord Holy Spirit Come here, Holy Spirit Heavenly strength in my heart Let me be reborn, Lord Holy Spirit What do you mean 'it was there'? The apple was there too when Eve took it but who offered it to her? Who gave it to her? Who gave it to her? The devil. - Yes, the devil. So you listen to him? What you did was serious, Agnese. Dead serious. Theft is a mortal sin. Just as a start, you have to take it back. Yes. What on earth were you thinking? It's because my mother confiscated my phone a few weeks ago. How come? She said a boy was sending me inappropriate texts. Was she just saying it or was this boy doing it for real? Yes, it was true. He goes to my school. Can't you see that your mother just wants to protect you? Because she cares about you and loves you. She sets limits for your own good, not just for no reason. Or maybe you don't want any limits. No, I do. - You want everything, like Adam and Eve. No... It's important to have limits, Agnese. Because they're set by someone who loves you, like your mother. Or like God, who isn't the father you imagine, who oppresses you, suffocates you and gives you orders. He's a good father, a parent, like a dad who gives good advice. And if you follow that advice, you'll live a happy and peaceful life. And you won't make these mistakes. Do you understand? Yes. - The same goes for your mother's advice. You have to trust her. You have to trust her. Mom, what are you doing? Nothing, I'm looking for some more clothes. I don't know where to find them. More refugees are arriving all the time. Is this your stuff? - Yes. From when I was your age. I kept them for you. But now... - Was this yours? Yes. - No, come on! Yes, it was mine. I used to wear it. No one would wear that now. This was nice... No, this is nice, I like it. Don't throw it away, let's keep it. I'm not throwing it away, I'm giving it to someone who needs it, right? You're right. But if you like it, keep it. No... - Go on. Listen, try it on. Go on! Try it on! Come on, do it for me. Try it on, go on. Go on, let's see. - Okay. We can keep something, can't we? We don't have to give it all away. It's nice, it looks great on you! - You think so? Yes, look. Take a look. Well? What do you think? Beautiful, right? Keep it, go on. I adore you, dear God, and love you with all my heart. Thank you for giving me life, making me Christian and protecting me. Forgive the sins I have committed today and accept the good I have done. Protect me as I sleep and free me from evil. Amen. I'm sleeping here, okay? Yes, of course. Whatcha doin'? - Hey, bro. What's up? I'm locking the gate. - Why? When the supermarket closes, I have to lock the gate. Wait up... Ah, you're the warden! You must be the new guy. That's you? - Yeah. Listen up, the gate's gotta stay open, there are people there. No, I have to lock it. - We live there. There's others too. - You open it, I ain't your warden. I ain't workin' for your lot. - Why this attitude? I ain't got no attitude. Don't say 'your lot', I'll get mad. You'll get mad? - The other guy was nicer. You're saying I ain't nice? - Yes! My God! I'm sorry about that. So the other guy was nice, right? Yes. - Why d'you wreck his car park? What about the fucking car park? What the fuck're you saying? Move! Who wrecked the car park? - It was you! Me? - Yes. You're paid to be a warden, not a jerk. You open the gate. - I will, idiot! Get lost! What's up? - Can I go to the loo? This ain't no kindergarten! - I need to go. Don't raise your hand. Just go. Get up and go. All right. - My God! Okay, so... the car park... The car park... Stefano... Stefano, where's your work vest? I wear it at the car park. I see, but you can't be bothered to wear it to meetings? It gets baking hot in here. - It gets baking hot... right. Do you guys enjoy being baking hot? Are you different? What's special about you? All right... Fair enough, I'll wear it next time. - Make sure you do. You've been here 6 months but you still don't know the rules? You've already screwed up once, you got fired from the mall. So what now? You want that to happen again? The car park job ain't simple, you gotta be on the ball. Understood? Leave him be. - I know. He just let a pretty girl getaway at the mall! Ivan, cut it out. - He was right too. Shut up, Ivan. I ain't talking to you. Stefano, look at me. People are queuing up outside to get a job. To be a caretaker for the gippos? - Hey, calm down! No, you don't get it... - I'm just asking. I'll answer you then. You don't get it. I ain't paid to spend my days arguing with you, is that clear? If you don't like it here, you can leave. D'you wanna stay or not? Yes! - Yes what? I get it, Giu. I get it, really. Do me a favour, be serious. Stay on the ball, please. Okay. Bye, guys. - Bye. 'Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God'. This Christian teaching has become a movement... You have some leaflets there. An enterprise that supports young people who want to remain celibate until marriage. The symbol of this journey is a ring with which you take a vow in front of the community. Both as a couple and alone. To promise to remain a virgin until marriage. It's an important decision, a difficult one. And when faced with difficult decisions, we ask for help. And who do we ask for help? We ask Jesus. He shows us the way with his words. One phrase in particular is very fitting today: Love one another as I have loved you. Jesus loved us by putting himself in our shoes. By actually experiencing our suffering. He was God, right? He is God and becomes a man. So he loves us by becoming us. Giving up his divine nature for us. So I ask you: How do you want to love? As Jesus taught us to or as society teaches us too? Society teaches us to love like we love things. I'll take you, use you for my own personal pleasure, then, at a certain point, I get bored, I leave you, I replace you. The same way we treat things. Jesus' teaching is different. What does he teach us? The only love that is worth experiencing is the one where you give others your all. Even your life. He died for us. So, this is called 'eternal love'. This is called 'marriage'. Why do you look confused? Your parents are married. You know what marriage is, right? Right, Andrea? Do you know? What do you think? Fr. Luca, what can I say? You're right, but when I go clubbing, and see a pretty girl I fancy, I wanna have fun with her. 'I wanna have fun'! Right? Fun! Isn't that a great word? 'Fun'? You know why you like it? Because you don't know what it means. You know where the word 'fun' comes from? The Latin word for it is 'devertere', to go elsewhere. To turn your back on... On what exactly? On the love Jesus taught us about, on the true love we talked about. But there's a word you don't like at all, which is extraordinary, and which also comes from Latin, it's 'sacrifice'. What does 'sacrifice' mean? No answer... what does 'panificio' mean? You know that. When it involves food, you know everything. What does 'panificio' mean? What do people make there? Bread. Yes, bread. 'Panem', bread. 'Facio', make. Make bread. 'Sacrificio', make sacred, you make something sacred. Now... He sacrificed himself for us. What about you? Are you willing to make your lives sacred? These are the rings. 'Symbol of your decision to lead a life of celibacy'. Shall we get them? What do you think? Now? Sure, we might as well. With one click, we can order them. Have you made up your mind? No, but in the meantime we can get them, then we'll decide together. Right, together... you'll take your vow with Matteo. I need to persuade him first. - Yeah, right... Hey! I do! He does whatever you say. He's your lapdog, poor guy. Well, of course! It took me a year to teach him. He's well-trained now. Exactly. That's why you'll take the vow with him. Yes, I'll take it with him. Yes. It's not my fault if you never fancy anyone. That's not true. - No? No! Well, okay... Can I call you back? Agnese's here. Speak tomorrow. Bye. How are you? - Fine, and you? Fine. - How's Bea? She's fine. - Did you have fun? You did? How was church this afternoon? - Good. When will you take your vow? I don't know. Father Luca said we need to think about it. In what way? It's an important decision and we need to think about it. I know it's important but... Do you still need to think about it? Yes, just like everyone else. Okay, but we've talked about it loads... No, talk to me, Agnese. It's important to me, you know that... It's the only thing I'm asking you to do. I know, but it's my decision. It's your decision. Okay, fine. If it's your decision... Anyway, me and Beatrice ordered the rings. Why didn't you tell me right away? I'm telling you now. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten... Hey there, bro. What're you up to, bro? Ain't you gonna answer? - Who the fuck are you? What the fuck are you doing? Keep going, go on! Check him out! Go on, keep on running! Go on, Heidi! Run! - It's the running man. Piss off! - Go, Rocky! Go on, run along! - What the fuck do you want? Keep it up! - Keep on running! What the fuck do you want? Go on, throw it! Go on! Come on, climb over! Climb over. - Shithead! Climb over! Come on! Come here, you 'piss' of shit! - 'Piss' of shit? Listen to you! You're a 'piss' of shit! - 'Piss' of shit! Learn Italian! I'll bust your ass! Put them next to each other. Oh God! 0h God, help me! I can't lift it. - It weighs a ton! Wait, it's stuck. Wait, watch out... Giovanni, I'm here. Where should I park? I've got some boxes. Wait, there's someone here... Listen... can I go in to the gypsy camp? The gypsy camp... yes, it's over there. - All right, thanks. Okay, I'm coming. There's some stuff to unload. - Will you give us a hand? Sure. - Thanks. Hi. - So, how are things? No one here has any ID, the hygiene situation is disastrous... That car park's used by the staff of a supermarket. You can imagine the tension. - Sure. Come inside, I'll show you round. Are you coming, honey? - I'll stay here with them. What are you doing? Nothing. Why are you in there? I came with my mother. To do what? We do voluntary work. Why are you here? I'm working. And the mall? They fired me, I'm not there anymore. Because of me? Don't worry, it's not... no. Don't worry. Well, get on with what you're doing. Mom, can I ask you something? Yes. Go ahead, honey. Could I have my phone back? No, Agnese, not yet. Change gear, is this second gear? Second gear! No, backwards... Agnese, this is first gear... No, stop, stop. Slow down. Okay, try again. It's been ages. That doesn't matter, what matters is what you did. I know, but I won't do it again. - Well, of course you won't. Stay calm, slow down, Agnese! Come on! Put it in second gear, second gear. Towards you and back. No, this is... Okay, now let's try again. First gear then go forwards. Okay. A bit faster, Agnese, come on. So why can't I have it back? Because I said no. It's not fair. - I know what's fair and not. No means no. You shouldn't check my phone. - Stop here. If I hadn't, you'd still be sending filthy texts to your classmate. He was sending them to me. - Trust me. I've been there. You're too young. We really shouldn't be arguing on your birthday. Come on, get out. Let me drive. Here he is. Hiya, mom. How are you? - Good. Hi. Don't I get a hug? You're skinny! Ain't you eating? - Sure I am. Let me make you something. - No. How about a coffee? - No, thanks. Hi. - Hi. No, I'm good, I don't want anything. - Let me look at you, it's been ages. How are things? - Fine. What's been going on? Let's have a chat. They told me you were working, right? You found a job? Where, doing what? I'm a car park attendant. - Good. So you found something. How about you? Just asking... You talk to him, he pisses me off. - I piss you off. You piss me off. - Don't start. Mom, it's okay, I get it. How much do you need? They'll kick us out this time. I just wanted to know, seeing you work, if you could lend us 100-200 euros. Just to help us out temporarily. Maybe they'll back off and let us stay a while longer. They won't kick you out, there's no point... I'm telling you they'll kick us out, believe me. They've never kicked anyone out. - They will this time. We'll end up like that lot outside, the refugees. We'll end up like them. - Not bad. They'll house you, give you 40 euros a day... You think I don't know? I see them every day. They've even got iPhones, Samsungs... Look what I have... They get 1,000 for doing fuck all, whereas we're getting kicked out. So now it's their fault. It's the tault of those who should help us. So it's a no? You're saying it's my fault. Not yours for doing fuck all. You're a loser, that's what you are. How dare you talk to me like that? - You're lucky I even talk to you. What are you staring at? Sit down. There's a present for you in the living room. A present? Go on. Go and have a look. Okay. Surprise! - Happy birthday! Happy birthday, ol' girl! I've booked the club, okay? We'll go there later. Let me through, let me through... Open it! Open it! Open it! Open it! Open it! Do you like them? Try them on. - Thanks! How about we all go on holiday together this summer? We should go camping in the mountains. - Good idea. But we'll wake up with creepy crawlies. Or with a spider on your face. - Don't be such a girl! Hey, I'm the girl in this couple. May the Lord bless you He made heaven and earth May the Lord bless you He made heaven and earth Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you, Agnese! Honey! Happy birthday! You're all grown up now! What can I say? Mommy's darling! Guys, I... I want to thank you for coming. Thank you for being our family. I'm going to cry now. And thank you, Jesus, for making us part of your life. Thank you, Lord Jesus. - Thank you, Lord Jesus. Darling, hi! My God, it's been ages! Where have you been? You never answer your phone. You're in the money now, right? Yeah, right! Look who it is! At long last! Where've you been? I almost didn't recognise you. - You see? Is it really you? - How's life? Good. Are you blanking me? - You've got a cheek! Don't I get a kiss? - You just disappeared! I know, but gimme a kiss. Come on! Go on, Jessica! You know why they're blanking you? They know what you do. What d'you do? Shall I tell them? Go on. What is it? He's a warden. I'm chief warden. - Really? I'm now the chief of police. - Watch, he'll arrest him now. Don'! be a jerk. How does working in a car park make me a warden? I'm a car park attendant, not a warden. You're a car park warden. Shut up, get stoned. Keep on pulling. Who's touchy now? - Keep on puffing. You kicked it at me. You're a son of a bitch. Don't be like Iris, pass the ball. One, two... to me. - Get off. Fetch the ball. - I told you already, cut it out. What the fuck are you doing? - Dickhead. Cut it out! - Get him away from me! You're a dickhead. What's so fucking funny? You slapped me. Stop it! - Shithead! Calm down. - Get him away from me. Let's go, come on. Come here, jerk. Enough! No fighting. We're all mates, come on! Hi. - Hello. Hi. - Hello. Shall we get some apples? Yes, these ones. How about a banana? They look rank. Want some grapes? - Get some. What drink do you want? - Look on that shelf. Let's get some vodka. How about some vodka? - Shall we get a melon? That's a watermelon, we ain't going to the sea. What are you doing? - Relax, I'm gonna pay you. He's checking the quality, let him drink. He's jealous, he's not allowed to drink. Are you a Muslim? Yes. - That's why! They can't drink. What happens if you do? - They cut your... They cut your throat? - Yes. How much is it? The total comes to 24. - What? The total comes to 24. - 24? Are you crazy? No, that's daylight robbery! It comes to 24. - 24? What did we buy? These are... - Come on, that's too much. These weigh too much. Now? Is it less now? No, it must be the apples. These cost a lot, they're heavy. It's these that are heavy. - It's the apples. Come on! - No, look. Come on, how much? We're robbing you, come on. Don't look outside. You should get CCTV, you need it. Gimme the money. - Sorry... Come on, bro. We didn't come here to shop, come on. I'm asking nicely. - Sorry. No, I'm sorry. Have you gone nuts here? I didn't wanna rob him, but 24 was way too much. What the fuck are they doing? What the fuck are you doing? Get back inside! Get back inside! Get off the fucking fence, get back! Get inside! Go on! What the fuck are you doing? Go on, break it! Drop dead! Drop dead, you fucker! Break it! Fuck you. Giulio, don't leave it there. Park over here. All hell broke loose here. - You're three hours late. They threw rocks at me. - Yeah, right... What's up? - You're no good at this job. What? - You heard. They went nuts, they wrecked the fence, they kicked it down... I told them to stop and they threw rocks at me. Cut it out. What're you doing? What d'you think? I'm fixing the fence. Well? Ain't you gonna help? We shouldn't have to fix it. I'll fix it with some wire. - That's useless. We'll tie it, it's all we can do. - It's wrecked. This is busted. Wire ain't gonna fix it. Listen, let's use that... You got it? Listen to the boss! It's the only solution. One more thing, Giulio. What am I supposed to do when it rains? There's no root on the hut, there's no shelter anywhere. Stefano, just go home. You'll get fired from here too. Find me some other job. - You don't get it. If you get fired from here, I can't help you no more, okay? Hi. I brought you some gifts. Thanks. Guys, let's play! Coloured pencils, great! - Happy? Yes. For you I've got something else. Yes! It's lovely! Guys, you shouldn't be here. - Come on, they're just kids. That's not my problem. You shouldn't be here, stay that side. I've told you a million times. Have this. - Don't bring them here. Bye. - See you later. For fuck's sake! They cause trouble, don't bring them here. They're kids, they're harmless. - They're not kids. They were throwing rocks at me earlier on. Are you following me? Well? I wanted to thank you for the other day. What for? - For the thing at the mall. Why do you visit that lot? I don't know, because they're poor. They need help. - I see, they're poor and needy. You're really something... Shoplifting from the mall, hanging out with gypsies, you're fearless. Did you learn how to steal from them? Come on, I'm just kidding! Come here. I'm just kidding. What's your name? - Agnese. Stefano. Hi. Wanna sit down? D'you wanna smoke? No. What's up? Nothing. I wanted to thank you. Okay, I get it. - No, really... Thank you. It's okay, no problem. Got any gum? Yes. No, I have to go, sorry. Where are you going? - I have to go, sorry. Wait a minute, hold on. Leave me your phone number. Your number, not your phone. I'll give you my number. I'll call my number, so we can... I'll call you, we can go out. Not at night, no. Not at night? - No. Only in the day? How old are you? - Eighteen. Guys, go play over there. Come on, move it... - We're just having a kickabout. Go play over there. - Come play with us. Wait. Come here, small fry. Get the ball off me and I'll let you play. What d'you want? Damn you! What's so funny? Go play over there! Honey! Mom, I'm in the bathroom. Can't you knock? I won't be a minute, I'll just wash my hands. Everything okay? Yes. No, it's not hot yet. - No? No. - Now it is! It's burning my feet! - Run, run! Didn't you bring a towel? Okay. Does it bother you? Shall I help you? - No. Shall we have a swim? I don't know if I'm going in. You don't know? - No. You made me come here but you ain't gonna swim? I didn't make you come. No? It was your idea. - No... I'm going in. You're going in like that? With your T-shirt on? Wait! Use your feet! No, your feet! - I can't. Try! Put your feet on my shoulders, stand up then dive off. I'm too scared! Don't be, I'll hold on to you. - No... Come on! Give me your hands. And the other one. Go on. What's up? Are you ticklish? Are you ticklish? Are you ticklish? - A bit... Are you or aren't you? I'm not tickling you now. Why are you laughing? I don't know. - I'm not doing anything. You've got sand here. Mom. The line's bad. What do you mean 'on the street'? What do you mean 'on the street'? No, no, no... No, I'll call you later. Yeah. Bye. What's up? My mom's been evicted. Let's go. Where? Don't you want to go? No, no... I don't give a shit. If you want, I'll come with you. You're sure you don't want to go? Did you give me a kiss? Maybe. Who gave you this thing? - A friend lent it to us. Want some water? - Yes, thanks. Where d'you find this pretty girl? I'm sorry you're seeing me like this, I usually look nicer. Right? - Yeah, when did you last pay Sandrino? I don't know, maybe a few months ago. A few months? - I told you. Whatever. May I? Rossana! Hi, look who's here. - Hi, Rossana. How are you? - Good. If I'd known, I'd have brought more. - Never mind. If you want to shower at mine tonight... Come, I'll be waiting. Don'! be silly. Bye. - Thanks a million, Rossana. It's a pleasure! I can't bear to leave this place. Sorry... What's up? That's my father. Well, I'll walk home then. What? I'll take you, come on. Start with the cushions. - Easy. Come on! - I'll whack you with this cushion... Idiot! - Who me? You're the idiot! Easy. What about these costumes? - Seen how nice they are? Look. I'm keeping this one. Honey... hey, hi. Hi. Where have you been? I know, I'm late. Sorry. Okay, let's think about tomorrow, it's important. Are you ready? Come on! - How many refugees will there be? Well, around thirty, right? - At least. Plenty. We have to do a good job, we're the first church that hosts them. Not again! We'll do a great job. - Right. Okay. Will you give us a hand, honey? No, I'll go help the others. Okay. Bye. - Bye. So are they Muslims or Christians? We don't know. They might be Christians. They get persecuted there, they burn down churches. Really? - Yes. No, the ones who are fleeing Africa are usually Muslims. Not always. - But will Muslims sleep in a church? Yes, what's the problem? I know plenty of Muslims who'd never set foot in a church. Would you sleep in a mosque? - I would. If you're homeless and have no place to go... Besides, they'll need to pray here. I don't know, but if they pray here, we have to take the pictures down. All of them? - I think so. Even the crucifix? - No, not that. That's the reason we're helping them, we can't take that down. You're right, but can they eat, sleep and pray with a crucifix there? I think it has to come down. I don't know. I'm going outside. - Okay. Look! Nice... It suits you. Yes, it's a bit tight though. - What do you think? Can I come in for a sec? Come on, let me see! Mom, leave us alone. - No, come on, let me see. Let me... you look so pretty! Let me take a photo. Those colours are great. Just one, though. Hold them up. - The rings? BLESSED ARE THE PURE IN HEART FOR THEY SHALL SEE GOD You look beautiful. When will you take your vows? - Soon, before the holidays. We need to speak to Fr. Luca. - Okay. I'm pleased to hear that. See you in church? - Yes. Or do you want a lift? - No. It's fine... Don't forget the pizza. - Okay. Bye. - Bye, Marta. No, well... Listen... do you love Matteo? Of course I do, you know that. Why are you asking me? How do you know? I just know, simple as that. I think about him all the time. What do you do when you're together? Well, we kiss, the whole time. Then I pull away, because I think we're going too far. But then he gets offended so we start again. That's what always happens. But I like it. How do you know when to stop? I just know. God knows when I need to stop. I'm going to the bathroom. Hey... Yes, all right. Bye. Let's go, I've got to do something. - What? Just something, I'll see you later in church. We need to get pizza on the way. You've already forgotten. You're right. Okay, well... I'll come with you. - No, see you in town at two. If I'm hurting you, tell me. Am I hurting you? I like you loads. Is that a bad thing? - Shit... It's a really bad thing. No... Why can't we kiss? Because... we need to get married first. Come on... All right. Let's do that. Can we do that now? No... do you... take as your lawful husband... do you? I do. - I declare you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. Why do you want to kiss me? Because you're pretty. I want to remain pure. You are pure. How are your folks? - Great. They're in pieces. Last night I prayed for them. You're gonna pray forever then. Haven't you ever prayed? Never? I used to pray. As a kid, then I stopped. Do you want to hear it? Yes. My father... every so often he'd go nuts. He used to blow his top. He'd start arguing, he'd beat up my mother and me... When that happened, I'd close myself in my room... and pray. I thought that you could... pray and ask for whatever you wanted. Right? Yes. I'd ask for him to die. You don't like what I said? No. But I prayed to stop suffering. Hey! Where were you? - Where's my mother? She's looking for you. She's at home. Okay, bye. - What's happened? Nothing. Where've you been? - Sorry, mom. Where've you been? Where've you been, Agnese? Answer me! I asked you a question! Answer me! With a friend... - What friend? Who? A classmate, you don't know her. - What friend is it? A classmate, you don't know her. - Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you call me? Why are you bullshitting me? Dammit! Couldn't you have called? I've waited four hours for you! Do you want me to be worried sick? Mom, I'm sorry... - Do you? God! I'm going to church. - Can I come? No, you're staying here. Please, mom... Stay here, you've already made me late for everything I had to do. You may as well take this. - No... Yes, take it. Go on! Emiliano, what's going on? I don't know, we just got here. Looks like they're kicking your folks out. Don't make trouble, go easy. No yelling. What's going on? - Who are you? I live with her. What's going on? - This is my son. By law, you can't live here. We were telling your mother that this has to be a temporary situation. We don't live here. They don't live here, they're not homeless. We found them here... - We're going to go back there. It's just for a few days. - We just came to inform you that this has to be a temporary situation. Can I say something? My son's sorting things out. I don't want to stay here, I want to go back home. Perfect. - I'm going home next week. We'll be back, we're just informing you. - You won't need to come back. You won't need to come back. - We hope so. It's just for now, this situation is just for now. When will you come back to discuss this... You need to lower your voice, there are people resting here. Let's remain calm. - There are young children. Stop creating havoc. - We're just doing a routine check... We're telling you that this situation can't continue. Yes, yes, yes! We got that, it's fine. - You can go now. Don't bother getting up! - You're making enough noise! Don't get up, you might strain yourself. - Why are you talking to them? You should've dealt with this. - You're telling me to calm down? Yes! You should've dealt with this. - I should've? I should've dealt with this? You've got a nerve! You've got a nerve! Am I her husband? Am I the father? - Enough, calm down. You've got a nerve! He's got a nerve, sitting on his chair! Shame on you! Good morning. - Oh, it's you. Wait a minute. This goddamn chain! What's up? - This won't take long. I've come about the house. - Got some money for me? Yes. Take this, but let them go back home. They're outside... Is this 200 euros? - Why? Stefano, listen... they're behind by 3.000 euros. D'you understand? This ain't gonna cover it. Keep it... - No, wait, I've got a job. I'll pay you back monthly. - I'm glad. You've got a job? Yes. - With a contract? All above board. - Take your contract to the bank then... get them to give you 3.000 euros, pay me, then pay them back 200 a month. That's how it works. First clear the debt then prove you can keep paying. Then we're talking. - It's my mother! This is our home, how can you kick out Italians? We should look after each other. - Whether you're Italian or foreign... The problem's the same: You either pay or don't pay. Your folks ain't paid for two years. With all my heart, do what I said then we'll talk about it. I was asking you as a favour. I'm sorry, bye. More, more. Can I have some too? Thanks. Thanks. Is it good? Mom, how did it go? Well. The person you are calling is not available... The person you are calling is not available... Get away from there! Get lost! Fuck you! You're a jerk. What's so fucking funny? What's so funny? Come on! No one wears a balaclava to break into a car! We never wore them for robberies. Has the sun fried your brains? Gimme a hug. Come here, bad boy. Is this where you work? Nice, did you fix it up? Are they your neighbours? Nice! Are they friendly? - Dead friendly. Hey, bro... - Don't start. Hey! - Wait... What the fuck d'you want? - Here we go... They're spiky. - Please! Who you callin' bro? Bro... Lele! Want a smoke? - Lele! If you gimme one. - Here. Want one? He never fucking listens. Come here! Okay... Chill out. - Please, do me a favour... Chill out. I know the gippos, they're my mates. You know what? We'll sell them some coke. They're loaded, we'll make big bucks. Don't look at their caravans... They're all loaded. - Yeah, now just let me work. You can't be here makin' trouble. - I just came to say hi! What the hell! What's up with you? I heard your folks got kicked out, I thought I'd check up on you. See if you need anything. - I don't. That's 'cause you're Superman, right? How did you get in here? Tricks of the trade. You're a jerk! - You're a great vigilante. Idiot, get lost. I go, bro. I go! I go, bro. Good day, bro. Me just kidding, now you mad, dammit! Get lost. - Holy Mary! See you later. - Yeah. The person you are calling is unavailable... No, guys. Keep the ball over there. Go play over there. I've told you a million times. Stop bustin' our balls! - No! Don't play here... Are you deaf? Want me to stick a hole in this? You shouldn't be here! This is part of the car park, go to your side! Do I come and bug you? Do I come and bug you? Gimme that ball! Fuck you! - We're sick of you, piss off! We'll fuckin' show you! We're done with you! Watch when I smash up your car park and all the cars. We're talking to you! You're Agnese, right? Yes. - How can I help? We've come to do a little check-up. - Okay. Seeing that Agnese has never had one. So, shall we have a little chat? Is that okay? Do you mind, madam? No, of course. Is there anything you'd like to ask me? I don't know. - I'll ask you a question then... Have you had intercourse? - No. Lie down please. One here... and the other one here. Slide forward. Okay. Relax. Breathe normally, Agnese. You're doing great. Mom, let's go. - Yes, we're going. Goodbye, madam. You can pay on the left. Thanks. Can I have word? - Of course. Wait here for me. I'll be right back. Can you pullover? I want to walk. - Why? I just do. Wait. So do you trust me now? Sorry, honey. I didn't want to put you through that. Really. But I don't know anything about you anymore. Where you are, who you're with. I'm worried something bad will happen to you, that's all... I don't know... I just don't want... Sorry. Very good! Great timing, I loved it. Well done. Now what? We'll explain the passage. - Okay, let's do that. So, let's try to understand it. The adulteress sinned by being unfaithful to her husband, so the scribes want to stone her, but Jesus... Well, he forgives her. - Your conciseness is very moving. Teach yourself: The Sacred Scriptures. What he said was true. But what's the point? The point is that all of us are the adulteress. Because we're sinners, we commit sins all day long. So what do we want, the scribes' stones or Jesus' forgiveness? Jesus' forgiveness. - Of course. So why then, whenever you screw up, do you torture yourselves? Maybe because we want to be perfect. And the scribes represent that part of us which wants to be perfect and which doesn't want to accept our own weaknesses. Exactly. They represent that part of us which sees sin and wants to destroy it, banish it and punish it because it doesn't accept it. What was Jesus writing on the floor at that moment? He was re-writing the law, based on forgiveness and mercy. Exactly. Because in life you love yourself for the good things about you. We love ourselves for the things that we consider to be good about ourselves. But Jesus goes further than that. He accepts the bad things that we don't like, our flaws. He loves us as we are. Because he knows it's hard, he knows we're not capable. And he accepts that you're afraid. Because you are afraid. Jesus is like a sat nav of a car. You may laugh, but it's true. He's like a sat nav. What does the sat nav do when you go the wrong way? It doesn't say: Idiot! I told you to turn left, not right! No, it recalculates the route. Jesus does the same thing. He recalculates your route. Because he always leads you home. Always. Hi. Go away. Just go. Go on. Why? - You shouldn't be here. Why did you come? I came to see you. - To see me? Do you feel sorry for me? Out of pity? D'you think I'm some poor gippo? Who the fuck d'you take me for? You disappeared! What the fuck d'you want? What d'you fuckin' want from me? Get lost! Don't come back here. Get lost! - I want to be with you. I want to be with you. Just go. What's up? Come on! Come on! Stay here. Get down! Get down! Stop! Stop! Enough! Stop! Leave me here. - Here? Are you okay? Are you okay? - Yes, I'm okay. I've got to get back. I'll call you later, answer your phone. Will you answer? - Yes, I will. Agnese. Are you okay? Hello? - How are you? Are you okay? Are you at home? - Yes, I'm home. I got fired. You got fired? - Can you believe it? I get fired and they get off scot-free. They didn't arrest them? It was their fault. - Of course, it's always their fault. But gippos do what the fuck they want. The cops don't even go after them. I don't wanna talk about it... Can I see you later? Hey... are you there? - Yes. I'll come pick you up. Forget it, bye. Honey, what are you doing here? Nothing. What's wrong? Are you okay? Yes. Are you sure? Shall we have something to eat? Are you hungry? No, I'll get some pizza with the others. Okay. - Can I stay at Beatrice's tonight? Okay. Maybe it's best you go. No. I want to stay. Are you okay? Has something happened? Lele! Hi. Lele... Can I have a word? What's up? Will you gimme some work? You wanna work? - Yes. How come? Things didn't work out. No problem. This is your home. Simo! - Hi, Ste. How are you? - I'm good, you? I'm good. Let me see this bad boy haircut. Let's see. Shaved off at the back... then long at the front. Cool, I like it. What you up to? - Nothing, we're just hanging around. We're bored. - You're bored? Poor kid, sorry to hear that. What can you do? Can you give me half a G? Sorry? - Can you give me half a G? What are you saying, Simo? They told me to come to you. Who told you? - Lele and the others. Go get some ice-cream, go on! - Ice-cream? I'll tell your mom. - Go on then. Get lost! Get out of here. Ste... Come here. Why didn't you sort that kid out? He's 12 years old. - Mind your own fucking business. II you wanna work, do as I say. Who cares if he's 12? He'll get it elsewhere. We ain't no social workers. Get it for him. Half? Don't give it to me, it's his. Was it that hard? - No. Can I get back to work now? Can I? Seems it was the gippos, they'll never catch them. They raped a girl. - What happened? They raped a girl. - Another one? Another one, you said it! - Hi. If no one does anything... - You know who it was? The gypsies, lady. If we don't fight back, we're like sheep. Can I have some water? - You don't need to burn their camps. You pull them up, teach them a lesson that they'll never forget... What's this about the gypsies? Seems they raped a girl. - Who? The gypsies. - No, who's the girl? A girl who lives round here. Ma'am, no. If you don't want to be helped... Who is it? I told you, she lives round here. She's one of the parish lot. She's a volunteer worker, a nice girl, I know her well. She's so sweet, poor girl. What's her name? Agnese. Agnese? That's right... - Agnese? Are you sure? Yes. They're involved with the mafia too, so you can imagine... You can't remember anything because you're in shock. But... How can you be sure that it was a Roma gypsy who attacked you? Seeing as you don't remember anything. Can I talk to my daughter alone for a minute? Please. Of course. Honey, will you tell me what happened? What happened? What's going on? What's going on? What're you doing? What happened? - They raped a girl. Who did? - These shitheads! These bastards! Stop! Come here! What's up? Enough.
