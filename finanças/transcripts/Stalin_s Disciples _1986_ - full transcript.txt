Doron Eran & Nadav Levitan Present: Stalin's Children By Nadav Levitan "The cannons have fallen silent "the killing field is orphaned" "a lone soldier roams the field..." "The cannons have fallen silent" "the killing field is orphaned..." Time to get to work. Starring: Shmuel Shiloh Yossi Kantz Hugo Yarden Rachel Dobson Aharon Almog Ezra Dagan Doron Golan Rachel Woloch David Rona (Toto) Dudik Smadar Atalya Kaplan "The killing field is orphaned... "a lone soldier roams the field..." "In... in... in the field... "The field..." "In... in the field..." Produced by: Doron Eran Written and Directed by: Nadav Levitan Stop singing already, Avreimeleh. What, I'm not allowed to sing? Listen... "During the night of March 5th Joseph Stalin's condition worsened." Worsened? -"His heart function showed serious disruption." Heart function? -"At 8 o'clock his breathing was irregular - "and continued to be for 3 hours." - Three hours? -"At midday - "he showed vascular disruption." - Vascular? -Stop it, be quiet. Shut up and listen. "Blood pressure is down, pulse is rapid, patient is pale. "The urgent measures taken took care of these irregularities." "At 1:30 unconsciousness set in..." Stop, I can't listen any more. See what it says here... "Two American heart disease specialists" "were brought in from Boston in order to care for the Leader." American doctors? Are they mad? They'll poison him. Moshkeh, what happened? Do you understand what he's saying, Leibel? I don't understand Russian. If it's about Stalin... it must be something serious. It's much more than that. Moshkeh, what is he saying? Come on, Moshkeh, translate for us. Moshkeh, I can't take it. What is he saying? We've been orphaned. The people's sun has gone out. It has sunken slowly. "The United Workers Party and all who serve their homeland, "the pioneers of the Jewish nation that gathers its dispersed brethren," "were shocked by the great disaster that befell the Soviet peoples, "the worldwide proletariat and progressive humanity," "as the great leader and lauded military hero" "Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin was taken." "We lower our flag to half mast in memory of this man of revolution, "architect of socialist foundation, captain of a global peace movement. "His historic achievements will guide future generations "as they further socialist and communist regimes around the world." "Arise wretched of the earth, "arise, convicts of hunger. "Reason thunders in its volcano, "this is the eruption of the end. "Of the past let us wipe the slate clean. "Masses, slaves arise, arise. "The world is about to change its foundation. "We are nothing, let us be all. "This is the final struggle. "Let us group together and tomorrow "the Internationale" "will be the human race." - Whoa. - Rivkaleh, you startled me. - You didn't come to the ceremony... - Let them talk, Rivkaleh. You're listening to that jazz again. If the comrades find out, they'll harass you again. - What's in there? - When will you get a haircut? Is it too long? "It doesn't matter to me." But, you know, people talk. Liar! Liar! Surround him! - Leave me alone! - Liar! - Go on, hit him! - Leave me alone! -Harder, more! Stop it, leave me alone. What have I done to you? What did you say about Stalin, what lies did you tell about him? I didn't say anything. I just don't know why everyone's sorry he's dead. Of course you don't, you stinking city boy. - Yeah, stinking city boy. - I didn't say anything. Of course you didn't, you stinking city boy. Leave him alone. Enough! Down, down, take your hand out, take your hand out. Does it hurt? Do you want to go to the infirmary? Maybe you should go home for a few days? Until things calm down. Go change your clothes and I'll write to your parents. Yankeleh, where are you going? You're all dressed up. - May I shine my shoes? - Come here. Take a brush. Shine away, Yankeleh. How do you keep your shoes so... If only the kibbutzniks took such care of their shoes. Come here, Yankeleh, let me see. Ah... A little fancy for my taste. Overdone. Yes. Too refined, right? You don't know if they belong to a woman or a man. They must have cost a fortune, eh, Yankeleh? But its beyond me why, they don't weigh a thing. There's no material here. And labor? A tailor's doing, not a shoemaker's. Spending so much money on one pair of shoes - when so many must go barefoot? - Can I have it back? Where are you going in the middle of the term? -Home. - Home? -And why the bandages? - The kids hit me. The kids hit you? - Kibbutz children don't hit. - Right. -Yes they do. Can I have my shoe back? - And why did they hit you? - I don't know. All I said was - it was good the tyrant was dead. - The tyrant? Who, Hitler? No, him. Is that any way to speak of Stalin? After you've been here for a year? After we have given you the best education in the world? But my father said that Stalin murdered thousands of Jews. - Shut up! Shame on you! - Your father? What other counterrevolutionary propaganda has your father told you? -What? What other lies have you heard from him? -My father's not a liar. Come on, let's hear it. He said that Stalin murdered many Jewish authors and doctors - and also sent millions... - Lie. Say its a lie or I'll rip your ear off. -Ow, no its not. Its not... ow... -Avreimaleh, have you heard this story? - Of course not. -And you, Leibo? - No, it couldn't be true. Hear that, Yankeleh, no one has heard this horror story. Thousands killed without our hearing of it? Maybe one or two, even three... Maybe. We shouldn't bury our heads in the sand and be blinded by faith. But the goal, Yaakov, sometimes the goal justifies the means. Besides, Yankeleh, you're old enough to understand... when you chop wood, chips fly. Right? But thousands, killing thousands of our people? How? When? Where? In Siberia. You little... - I'll get you. - Shame on you. Very cheeky. Who taught you to talk about Stalin like that? Curse you! I'll get you... you worm. I'll show you! - Cheeky! - I'll show you... what? How far have we gone?! -Just see what I'm going to do to you! Stinking city boy! Quiet, quiet, Comrades. Quiet down, Comrades. That's not on the agenda. - We must have a basic discussion. - Yes. The secretariat's avoiding it. We have to decide about the German reparations before Elkeh leaves. - Of course. - A fundamental decision. Comrades, Comrades, enough. Quiet down. We are here to discuss only one thing: Elkeh's trip to Eastern Europe. No more. -Why is he going there? The Party feels that all the countries of Eastern Europe that were involved in the war whose Jewish citizens were harmed must pay compensation, just like Germany. I hear what you're saying, but I still haven't heard what the Party thinks about people here receiving money? What happens then? What will happen to the movement and to the kibbutz? - What will happen then? - But that's not the subject at hand. - Its not on the agenda. - Oh yes it is, Comrade Moshe. - Its on the agenda night and day. - Wait, wait one minute. A Party proposal is in the works, if you want to hear it. -Yes. They're suggesting that the kibbutz file for compensation collectively. - Bravo! -Very good. - Boo, boo. -Why are you booing? Comrades, Comrades, why all the yelling? Ideological collectivism, huh? - Shame on you, anarchist! - Loafer, freeloader! -Sham! Comrades, Comrades... Elkeh, please continue. Just a moment. Listen. Each member will sign a power of attorney in favor of the kibbutz. Anyone who refuses will cease to be a member. - Bravo! - Boo, boo! -Bravo! Bravo! Stop all your yelling. This subject isn't on the agenda anyway. Let's vote today. -Let's bring it to a vote tonight. -Tonight. Comrades, Comrades, I just don't understand you. -What? This is a delicate issue. These are our friends, people who've suffered. It's a serious matter. It must be treated privately and with a great deal of patience. Nonsense. We need a basic decision. Today. -What do you suggest, Leibeh, that we tell our comrades who went through the Holocaust - they must sign tonight or pack up? - It may be best for some to leave... But the decision that we reach will strengthen the kibbutz's common base - and equality. -Wolff is right. - Good for you, Wolff. - German putz. - What did you say? -German putz. Comrades, comrades, settle down. - The noblewoman from Warsaw. - The righteous man from Germany. Why are you talking like that? Don't you understand what they went through under fascism? Don't you give me a history lesson, comrade, okay? - For me it's not history, comrade. - My father lost everything he owned. Yes? What? A beer brewery? Those who should be arguing here... Dora, Dora, where are you going? This isn't fair. You're blaming us for what you went through? I'm not blaming anyone, but its not fair to make - such fundamental decisions for us. - So what do you suggest? That we not accept compensation from those villains. Or that anyone who was there decides for himself. -And your decision? Don't be rude, Moshe. It's none of your business. Nor is it any of yours. Good for you, Dora. Good for you. - We'll bring her before an inquiry. - I want my compensation. Yes, yes, that's right. For me, for myself. For heart surgery in America. Do you want that to go on record? Why not? Write it all down. Word for word. Gita Nibesh, cardiac patient for ten years, wants to live, whether it fits kibbutz principles or not. Heart surgery? What is she talking about? I think something's wrong with her. Write it down. Good for you Gitaleh, good for you. Tell me, Kuba, why are you always in favor of those against? Very true, in favor of those against or against those in favor. Gitaleh's health is more important than your ideology. Stop babbling! Decadent. Abstractionist. Modernist. Shoemakers. You watch it! Comrades, Comrades, quiet, I implore you. Antek? Antek? Antek... I'm here, Gita. - Why didn't you come to the meeting? - It has nothing to do with me. But it has to do with me. Why did you get out of your chair? Why are you coming up? You know you shouldn't exert yourself. Its bad for your heart. That's not what will break my heart. What are you doing here? - You won't believe me. - Try me. You wouldn't understand. Do you think only other women are able to understand you? I recorded bats. Bats? Why do you need bats? - I knew you wouldn't understand. - No, I want to hear. Really? Stop it. I can't listen to that, stop. What happened? They sound so miserable. Poor things. Its nothing, Gita. They're simply warning each other of danger. But why do you need this? I have plans. If we play this in the orchards they won't approach the fruit trees. They'll think the area is dangerous and flee. The fruit will be saved. - You think it sounds idiotic. - No, not at all. On the contrary its a brilliant idea but I... -But. There's always a "but". I'm afraid you'll be laughed at. I thought that I finally came up with something useful. Something agriculturally beneficial, as they say. But you're a wonderful teacher and the children love you. That doesn't count. Only those who do physical labor... and have children are accepted here. We don't do either. Some day I'll go to America. They do revolutionary heart surgery, open heart surgery. Then everything will change. What are you talking about? You'll see, Antek. Everyone will see. Doraleh... How are you? I've missed you. - Not here, Shmulik. - Aren't I allowed to talk to you? And to say that I brought supplies from the infirmary, here. This is for you, a new Swiss drug for your leg. -You shouldn't have. You must fix your heel. Better you should buy chocolate for your children. Look, I was at the lawyer's office, I brought your papers from him, - for you to sign. - Are you crazy? -It's urgent. The movement is pressuring him to finalize a standard contract for all kibbutzim. Everyone will waive their compensation - in favor of the kibbutz. - So what can I do? What you can do is... look, I discussed it with him and he said he can arrange something for a certain percentage, of course. - I didn't know you were a "salesman". - Just give me a chance. He said he could arrange for you to agree to waive a small portion of your compensation in favor of the kibbutz, while keeping the majority for us. For you. - And then what? - And then what... Think about us, Doraleh. We can leave the kibbutz together. Really... We can go to America and start over. You know, Shmulik, I think you love me because of the money, - as banal as that sounds. - Stop that. - That's what you see in me, isn't it? - Please, I'm asking you to stop it. Give me the papers. I have to think about it. No way, I'm not giving them to you. It's better if I hold on to them. Look, I'm not eligible to receive compensation, no one will suspect. I've passed the sick room, I have to distribute the food. Bye, Shmulik. "Sevastopol is weak," "we'll conquer it at once." The heroic battle for Sevastopol lasted 250 days. The heroes protecting the city showed great courage and wrote a page in the history of the Soviet Union. Hitler's bold attacks were halted at the city walls. I think I'll go home, Shmulik. I'm tired. Go. It's a war movie, you won't miss a thing. The defenders of Sevastopol mercilessly crushed the Germans' battle plans in the South. The long siege on the city began. Hitler's soldiers gathered forces. Just then, upon Hitler's personal orders, a huge, experimental cannon was brought to Sevastopol. It was 800 millimeters in diameter. Who is it? "We were exposed this day, we'll arrive and roar: we're here." How were you able to come here? My wife went to bed and I stayed for the movie. - Can you stay for a while? - Until the movie is over. Have you decided about the payments from Germany? -Not now. - Do you have any idea what you'll get? - Not now, Shmulik. You have to decide soon, before they get suspicious of us. -Shh. -Of you. Shh... the walls have ears. How much money can it be? - Good morning. - Good morning. - Elkeh. - Yes. Give me your suitcase, let me help you. -Thanks. - See you. -See you, bye. - See you, bye. - Bye, guys. - See you. -Bye, guys, see you. - Bye, good luck. - Thanks, thanks a lot. - Good luck. - Thanks. -See you. - I'm going now. - Bye. -Good luck with your mission. Thanks, thanks a lot. Thanks. Have a seat. Wait, before you go, I'd like to request something. - I'm not bringing any gifts, Kuba. - There's nothing to bring - from the Communist bloc anyway. - Yes, so what is it that you want? I want to ask you to allow your wife to pose for me so I can paint her. Posing is fine, but don't paint her with her nose on her ear, her mouth on her forehead, like... - that painter Picasso, okay? - Not an abstract. You'll get Rachel with socialist realism. And promise me you won't make her ugly, eh? -Come on, Elkeh. - Even I can't make her ugly. - Don't exaggerate, Kuba. Wait, wait Rachel. Artists can't be trusted these days. They always show the ugly things, - instead of showing the positives. - Don't worry, only great artists do. - You'll be pleased with my results. - Stop, Kuba. Let her be. Go in peace. And you'll see for yourself when your return. - Bye, Kuba. - I'll meet you in the studio. Bye, Rachel. Take care of yourself. Have a good trip. And don't forget to write. "The cannons have fallen silent "the killing field is orphaned "a lone soldier roams the field "singing in the spirit of clouds. "The vulture will soar in the sky" "and pounce on the corpses." Why did he take so many? Did he forget about the austerity? He's just a big knocker. Do you really think he's such a big lover with his wife? Than with who? -What, now wait... The way she looks now? - He did make three children, though. - But that doesn't mean that he enjoys it. Did you see how many rubbers he took? That couldn't be just for his wife. He would kill her. Moshkeh, do you know something? Or are you just saying that? - What do I know about this stuff? - Come on, Moshkeh... Moshkeh... Leave me alone, I'll get you with this coffee. Leibel, do you see that? A fellow worker, kibbutz and Party member, and he doesn't want to tell us. Why are you so quiet? What secrets are you hiding? Secrets? What secrets could there be on kibbutz? -Oho... You know all the secrets, why don't you tell us. Is something of specific interest? I see. Here, let me attach that for you, okay? The heel. - But you'll need a new shoe. - Whatever you say, doctor. -Okay. I see Kruschchev is already here. - Yes? - Isn't Stalin jealous? And what about your compensation from Germany? -What about it? Some members receive compensation and don't tell the kibbutz. - Yes? Which members, for example? - We don't know... But maybe you do know. Try this. Hello, shoemakers. - Hello. - Hello. -Hello. Dora... Are you going to the infirmary? Bye, shoemakers. Don't start the revolution without me, okay? Knocker. - Stop it, Shmulik. - What, I didn't do anything. Did you see how the witch shut up? Do you think they... Really, Avreimeleh, them? What? - Dora and Shmulik? - I'd believe anything about her. - I'm also sure she's hiding something. - Hiding what? Her compensation from Germany. And she must be getting a lot, - judging by the way she's limping. - Oh, Avreimeleh, one doesn't have to be a pig. Even if you're right. Well? -Stop following me. I don't want to hear that nonsense. - Will you listen for just a moment? - Leave me alone, I implore you. If they see me talking to you, they'll think I've gone crazy. Wolff, listen... listen. You yourself said that five percent of the fruit is damaged by bats. So I said that, so what? It's not your expertise, pal. Don't you want to increase the crop? You could be the regional crop per plot champion. Not by using Baron Munchhausen's methods. Set loudspeakers in the orchards? Play bats their own sounds? The bats would tease me. Worse - the members would tease me. You'll thank me when it increases the crop. Antek. Look, if you really want to help me... Why don't you come work for me? Between you and me, you only work with the kids half the day. Come to me, get your hands dirty, prove yourself. And then we'll see. Hah? Kuba, do you intend to give this to my husband looking like this? Elkeh wants socialist realism, no? Don't worry Rachel, its only the base. I'll dress you later. Kuba... Kuba... Really... - Kuba! - Kuba. Kuba? Dora, is that you? I'm sorry to come so late, - but you're the only one whose awake. - What happened? My room was broken into. -Get the security officer or the secretary. No, I don't want to. That's why I've come to you. - Can I trust you? - Can I help you in some way? But it must remain between us. It will remain between us. So will this. - I must see Shmulik. - Shmulik? Can you get him out of the house somehow? - If he's not asleep? - Even if he is asleep. Go home, I'll send him to you. It's a good thing you took my advice and left the papers with me. What difference does it make, if they're suspicious of me anyway? Don't feel guilty. You deserve that money. No, I can't go on like this. We either pack up and leave or give the kibbutz the money like everyone. Don't be such a saint, okay? You deserve that money. Besides, how do you know they hand it over? No, I don't know. And we'll never know. - But I can't keep living a lie. - Don't tell me that you intend to give your compensation to the kibbutz. -I don't think so. Good, good. I don't think I'll accept the compensation at all. What do you mean you won't accept the compensation at all? What? -It means that I don't want any compensation from the Nazis! Not for me, not for the family I don't have and not for the communist shoemakers. Tell me, Dora... what will happen with us? With our plans? - What plans? - The plans... that we'll leave... together, for America... I don't recall having such plans. I don't recall having any plans at all. Besides, I don't even know what it is you see in me. Because of the money... There's no money now. None. Right? Is that what you want? That's what there is. Yes, Gita, what may I do for you? - I need new shoes. - Um, but those look to be fine. Not every day shoes. I need Sabbath shoes. What can I do? Well... I can't object. Each member is entitled to a pair every other year and Gita hasn't used her right in many years. May I see samples? -Yes, of course. Avreimeleh, get the sample. Avreimeleh... In the meantime, let me measure your foot. Hand me that paper. Yes. That's the sample. Is that all there is? -It's a good strong shoe and will last for years. I don't like it. I want something more elegant. Elegant? What can I do? With all respect, Gita, why do you need something more elegant? - To go to America. - America? - Why must you go to America? - Open heart surgery. -What? - Open heart surgery? - What is that? Simple. Its revolutionary surgery that restores you to a normal life. I don't believe what they write in the Western newspapers. They only seek sensational stories. Nonsense. -Its radical capitalism. They just want to take money from innocent people. -What can I do? You'll see yet, I'll have the surgery and you'll eat your words. -Yes, successful surgery, patient died. You took the words right out of her mouth, Leibeleh. - That's exactly what I told her. - You'll see yet. The surgery will be successful and I'll be able to dance and work. So, what do you say, Moshko, won't you make me a more elegant pair of shoes for the trip? I don't know. You're really putting me in an uncomfortable position. As if I were some kind of fanatic. - The kibbutz hasn't approved a trip. - Don't hide behind the kibbutz. Who is the kibbutz, anyway, if not you? And all of you? And me? - Yes, me, too. - No. Absolutely not. I won't do anything that opposes the principles. I'm going to America. Even if I have to go in every day shoes. I'll even go barefoot. What can I do. - Kuba, my arm hurts already. - Do you want to stop for the day? No, you must finish. Elkeh is returning next week. So resume the pose, please. This is where our artist works. Wait, I think she's upstairs. Kuba? Kuba. What is it? -Um... - Good Sabbath. - Good Sabbath. - Say, is Rachel here? - Why do you ask? - She has a visitor. - Who is it? - Someone from the Party. - Um... just a minute. Rachel, the Party is calling you. Rachel. Hello. -Hello. -Please meet Dov, from the Party Secretariat. - Hello. - The External Affairs secretary. - Elkeh send his regards. - Thank you. How is he? - What have you heard from him? - He's healthy and well. - Is that what you came to tell me? - Well, not exactly. We have all sorts of... you see... You're scaring me. -No, no. No need to worry, although... - we have a small problem. - What kind of problem? Regarding his return next week. Please. -Well, as far as we know, he won't be returning next week. We don't know when he'll be back, but it clearly won't be next week - as we had anticipated. - Just a minute, let me understand. - Did you give him another task? - No, no, Rachel. I'm sorry, but it's not us. There must be some mistake, something that will be rectified. What are you talking about? What happened? Why the delay? Well, the thing is, the Czech security forces are... How is Elkeh involved with the Czech security forces? -Relax, Rachel. It's so absurd that I'm certain it must be a stupid mistake. What do they want? What happened? The Czech authorities have arrested him for spying. Spying? Elkeh a spy? They're charging him with spying for the Imperialists and Zionists. - But of course... - I swear, this sounds familiar. Don't tell me this is actually happening, and to Elkeh no less? Comrade, don't rush to hasty conclusions. Really, Comrade? What should I conclude, that he's a spy? Of course not. No one's accusing him of spying, but we must be certain - there's no blot on his character. - I can't believe what I'm hearing. Elkeh must prove his innocence to you? Why, do you have doubts? Comrade, please, you must understand the situation we have been put in. - That you've been put in? - Yes, us, the Party, as well. You must understand that we are on the verge of an affair that may cast a negative spotlight on the entire Communist bloc. The entire Communist bloc's unequal to one hair on my husband's head. Comrade, the Party trusts that you have a firm grasp of class status, as befits a Party activist's wife. And that you understand that the credibility of the Communist regime and of the entire progressive Socialist camp is at stake. That's for the entire progressive Socialist camp. And that's for you. I'm telling you, there's no smoke without fire. Why are you looking at me like that? What have I said? There's no smoke without fire, that's a simple fact of nature. You don't agree with me, hah? - You disagree with me, right? - Right. Elkeh is a friend, - a Party member and a kibbutz member. - The cat's out of the bag. Blind loyalty to a friend. Friendship above all else. Well, I actually respect that. Loyalty and friendship are definitely nice qualities. Heartwarming, even. But spying for imperialism - is a betrayal of the Socialist camp. - Wait, where are you off to? Why are you so quick to judge him? Maybe there's been a mistake - and he's been wrongfully accused? - Comrades, it's either or. - Either or what? - You either believe Elkeh or you believe the Communist Party. There's no other option. - Well? - Well, what? Dialectics, Comrade. Dialectics. Dialectics... Who do you believe? You must choose. It's a difficult question. -So what? If we run from difficult questions... Besides, between us... word of Elkeh's arrest will spread and the whole country will be abuzz. We'll see a battle of the Titans between revolution and reactionism. So what will it be, Comrades? Whose side are we on? Moshkeh, I really don't know. Its confusing and painful. Elkeh has been my friend for a long time. And he's one of the best among us. And this doesn't hurt me, Avreimeleh? What am I, a fanatic? But a person is an immense mystery... You can never really know what and who he truly is. - Dialectics, huh? - Yes, dialectics, Comrade. Moshkeh, please tell me how, according to the dialectics, Moscow is always right? Okay, okay, I heard you. - Yes, you heard. - Don't interfere. When I say I believe something, I'm not just saying it. The Members' Committee was notified that Wolff is leaving the kibbutz. - Wolff? -Wolff? - Yes, yes, Wolff, Wolff. And why is that? Because he wants his reparation payments from Germany. He's been arranging the whole thing very quietly and announced two days ago that he was leaving. Just like that, with his wife and kids. Wonderful native-born Israelis. - Wolff? - Him, of all people? Wolff bowed down to the golden calf. This has never happened here before. And not only that. They're not only leaving the kibbutz they're moving to Germany. - To Germany? - Why would he move to Germany? He's going back to manage his father's beer factory. He's going to distribute beer to the Nazis. In that case, I really will start to believe anything. So next time, don't jump when I say there's no smoke without fire. Look at them, leaving like thieves in the night. Saint Wollf. -They had a home, a country, and they packed up again. Kuba, come here a minute. - What is it? - This way or this way? This way. Can't you tell which way is up and which is down? But you paint brown skies and red earth, which confuses me. What sky are you talking about? This is a composition. Do you think the members will understand? -What's to understand? - Kuba, come here a minute. - Again? Maybe you should hang Rachel? Show them you can paint normally. No, no. That's a personal painting to give to Elkeh when he returns. By the time Elkeh returns, Rachel won't look like that. He'll be back much sooner than you all think. Really? After the showcase trial they put on against him? It's all politics, Rivkeleh, tomorrow the politics will change. The evil one will become a saint and the saint will become Satan. Leave this alone and take the pictures to the dining hall. Bon appetite. Bon appetite, Antek. What crap. For this he receives work days from the kibbutz? Its just a ruse. I can smear paint like that, too. Why don't we ask for smear days rather than working in the grove? Do you think he'd notice if we added a few smears? Of course not. Let's add just a few small corrections. What are you doing? That's really not nice. Forget it, even Kuba himself doesn't know what he's got here. Villians! Vandals! Hooligans! You need art? You deserve cow manure. Bird droppings. - What happened, Kuba? - What happened? Don't you see? They scribbled on my canvass. They ruined by painting, crapped on my creation. Those asses. Where? I don't see anything. God, you gave the painter a blind wife. Shame you're not mute. They don't need art, those hooligans. Magazine photos are enough for them. Stalin, Lenin, Marx, Engels and all the rats. As if he was injured. -He scribbles instead of working, then complains. Antek, darling... I'm back. Gita, Gita. What a change. I'm speechless. What happened to you? Cat got your tongue? No, no, I don't need the chair. But if you don't mind, could you get my suitcases? Thank you. You may take the chair to the infirmary. Shall we go home? I'll tell you everything later. Moshko... Sonia, isn't that Gita? It is Gita. How amazing. - Hello, Gita. Welcome. - How was America? What can I say - it was America! You have to see it to believe it. I'll tell you everything when I have a chance. Bye, see you. What can I do. Did you see the shoes, the earrings. Oh, ho... She looks great. -Great? She looks American, Korba. Actually, its not bad, not bad at all. Tell me, Moshko, open heart surgery, do they already have that invention in Russia? Really, Sonia, do you think they're primitive there? Russia has everything. - Who is this? - Lenin. - Who is this? - Stalin. - Who is this? - Kruschchev. Who is this? Come on, don't you know? Who is this? Come on. Marx. Marx, Engels. Marx, Engels, good. Take the flags. Come closer everyone. In pairs. Asafi and Shaul, you hang one on the tower. Be careful, though, okay? You and me in the secretariat. And you two in the cowshed, okay? One minute, we're not hanging anything, no flags. Give me all the flags. Give me the flags. Give me the flags. What happened? Why not hang the flags? It's a waste of effort, Moshko. I don't think there will be a party. Moisheleh, if you don't want to, don't come, but we're celebrating. - What are you doing? - Stopping your party. Are you out of your mind? Moshko, there will be no party! Don't you understand? No, I do. The entire free world is celebrating the Communist Party's twentieth conference and we have no reason to celebrate? Go read in the newspaper what Kruschchev discovered about Stalin. Horror stories. Forced labor camps, Siberia, executions, informing, false trials. And he portrayed himself as God. You're crazy! Moshko, look what they did to us... Look at what they did to us. - As if we're some sort of traitors. - Stop it, enough. Go into the house, that's enough. Moshe, you are the Secretary and you must find out who did this. - Secretary, yes, but no detective. - I don't care. Investigate. Either you find out who did this or I'll go to the police. Police, on the kibbutz? Come on. Why don't you bring in the KGB? - KGB? You should be ashamed. - Relax, Moshko. The members are simply shocked by what they found out about Stalin. So a few hotheads are expressing themselves this way. - But why against me? Why? - Really, Moshko, a Communist like you speaking out against Russia? What's going on, I don't understand. Until yesterday everyone looked East and now calling me a Communist is an insult. Yes, I'm a Communist. That's right. So what? - I'm also willing to suffer for it. - Okay, then suffer in silence and leave me alone. "Krushchev confirmed in his sensational speech "that rumors which were prevalent in the West for years" "regarding Stalin's regime.." "In his speech, he admitted that Stalin ran a cult-like regime. "His method abused "the principles of Socialism and law." "People were trampled, their conscience broken and honor defiled. "Stalin's regime is stamped "with a seal of provocation, blood, "prisons, forced labor camps," "and suffering of innocent people." Leibel... Leibel... What are these books that you brought here? - You want to open a library, eh? - These are good books, - it's a shame to burn them. - "The Complete Writings of Lenin"... That's all we need, after all that's happened here. But look at the paper, its grade A. We can use them to measure, instead of that paper that always tears. It's good... Alright, let's play a little game before we eat, okay? Good thing we don't have much work. My back has been killing me lately. With the luck I've been having, they'll close the shoe-making shop. Times have changed. Everyone goes into town to buy shoes and all we have left are repairs. Leibel, I want to ask you something. Did you really believe that Elkeh was guilty of something? Did you? The main thing is that its over and he's coming home. -Finally. It weighed on me like a heavy stone. Leibel, do you think that Moshkeh will come to see him? Who knows... He's stopped speaking ever since he broke down. He doesn't make a sound. Our friend has gone silent. Maybe you'll come with me after all today, Moshko? Did you know that Elkeh is back? Maybe you'd like to see him, to say hello. Moshko, Moshko. "Till the morning light, till dawn gleams "shoulder to shoulder, endlessly going round. "Till the morning light, till dawn gleams "shoulder to shoulder, endlessly going round. "We share one heart, "forged together in joy and in hardship. "Till the morning light, till dawn gleams" Welcome, welcome! Welcome, welcome! Say something. Comrades, on behalf of the Party I'd like to welcome Elkeh upon his return from Czech prison as a Prisoner of Zion. We're all happy to see you, Elkeh, undefeated, whole in spirit, and strong, stronger than those who judged, tortured and convicted you. The truth will triumph! Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Comrades, there are no words to express my joy at returning home to you. You see me standing before you healthy and whole in body and mind. I have been through difficult days, but this is not the time to go into details of the torture, suffering and humiliation. With that, I'd like to tell you that I never gave up. There is no doubt in my mind, comrades, I've remained faithful to the Socialist revolution movement. - Go to hell. - Shhh... -Shhh... I am not among those who, following Kruschchev's revelations, went mad and despaired of the Soviet Union and of their belief in Socialist revolution. Yes, comrades, I've remained loyal to the battle of the Revolutionary Workers Movement. I wholeheartedly believe that Socialism will win in the end. Elkeh... - Elkeh... - Good to have you back. - Welcome, welcome. - Welcome. Welcome, welcome. "During the night our song splits the sky "return, our dance, renewed sevenfold, "come and we'll twirl once more for our path is endless. "For the chain is unbroken "for our heart is one now and forever" "for the chain is unbroken..." "For our heart is one now and forever" "for the chain is unbroken..." "Arise my brethren, spin around "do not rest, again and again "there is no beginning or end, hand to hand, don't let go! "Day has set and day will dawn, we'll work side by side "from village and city with scythe and plumb line.

The Russians sent a Sputnik into space. Moshkeh, with a cosmonaut, can you hear me? Moshkeh, with a cosmonaut. Moshkeh, a Soviet man is in space! "Elijah the Prophet..." "Elijah the Tishbite..." "Elijah the Gileadite..." At 8 o'clock he'll pass over Israel. We have binoculars. The sun will set shortly. Let's try to see him. Moshkeh, let's go up the tower. Let's go up the tower, Moshkeh. Okay? "A good week." Elkeh, give me the binoculars. Can you see anything? - Can you see anything or not? - Stars. -What? -Lots of stars. Don't look for stars, look for the Sputnik. - Come on, can you see anything? - Leibel, you take it. Maybe you'll be lucky. Nothing, Comrades. Black, black and more black. Give it to me, Let me try. - Do you see it? - Elkeh, what do you see? - I don't see anything. - What? But I feel that it is there. Moshkeh, take it Moshe. You try. Take it. Try, maybe you'll see. Moshkeh. - Moshkeh, what do you see? - Moshke, do you see something? Moshke, do you see something? - Where? - See... "Stalin's Children" Subtitles production: Elrom Studios
