The verification committee will now look at the case of... Lieutenant Franciszek Mauer. 37 years old, married, parent to one child. Finished law school in Krakow in 1978. With a distinction. In the same year he started work in the department. In 1980 he married Milena Kurzepa, a daughter of the then Minister of Internal Affairs. Promoted immediately in December 1980, 31 reprimands, 18 commendments. Two awarded at the request of the Minister of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation. Thrice dishonorably discharged and hired again, details not provided. Mister Mauer, what did you do about captain Nowakowski? Who, in 1980, tried to form free trade unions in the deparment? I blew his head off. With a 7.8mm Mauser. Could you explain that, please? Nowakowski killed his wife, took his daughter to a roof, and threatened to push her off if they would not meet his demands. What demands? The creation... of free trade unions and a raise of 2200 zlotys. What then? And then I climed a power plant's chimney... and I shot him in the head. What else is there to explain? And they gave you a medal for that. Somebody liked that I hit his temple with a single shot from 220 metres. So they promoted me. And they started to invite me to hunts... Did you know Captain Nowakowski before? We studied together, Witek... Captain Nowakowski was my... He was my colleague. PIGS Cast Guest appearances Edited by Set design by Music by Art director Executive producer Producer Direction and screenplay by Come on, Jerzyk, get up there. What? So many? Are you joking? These are from the last two years. All from just two voivodeships! Hold these. Lieutenant, sir... What will happen now? Nothing. It will be just like before. Or better. Careful, Gramps. Be careful, Gramps! Pick everything up. Every sheet of paper. Oh, I remember. I almost got him. Did you find this? Yeah. In an antique shop in Hamburg. The episcopate bought it back. Through...this guy... Zielinski! Yeah! Hold it well, gramps! How is he? He died of a heart attack. Last winter. Go to hell! The actions of your men are illegal! And let me inform you that today at noon we notified MP Kmida's senate committee, which deals with cases of lawbreaking in your business. My what? Mr Stopczyk, don't make fools out of us. I am not interested in lawyer talk. You must stop burning documents! Soon, you and your men will stand before Senator Wencel's lustration committee from the Christian Union Party. Excuse me, Captain? What about that Otwock case? Just a second, Olo. Mr Wątecki... I take orders from my supervisors. You're a bit too low. Should we continue or close it? Please wait for me in my office, gentlemen. Mrs Irena will lead you there. Mrs Irena... Give me a break. I know the route by heart. I would get there blindfolded! Blindfolded? That'd be the other way! I think you're really sexy and that you want me. Admit it. Stop before I call the police. I'm the police! Hello? It's that case. Priest from Otwock. Close the investigation due to lack of evidence. As it is? Ah, no, you have to interrogate his daughter. I know, but I thought that since we have to burn it tonight... Interrogate the daughter. Then close. There must be order in the documents. No matter what system. And if she testifies something incriminating? Olo, you know this one? A water skier drowned. And the lifeguard does CPR... Yeah, I know it. I need to go to my co-op. They're taking my flat. Huh? Yeah, after my internship I got it as a backup flat, and now it turns out that it belongs to the caretaker. They want me out or cleaning the building. Is the building big? Franz, take it for me. I need to see the president. His son-in-law is... the head of the Środmieście Department. You know, Pekocki. You wanted to smack his face once. Okay, I'll pick her up for tomorrow. Thanks! I gotta go. You better hurry! Be gentle, and close it. We're going to close it tonight anyway. Where is she? Where!? In the orphanage! Not in the presbytery! Andżela! - For what!? - For nothing! Angelika Wenz! Get up! Lieutenant would like to talk to you. Hi, Franz. Good afternoon. Lieutenant. You look beautiful. Listen, Franz. Let's talk about Bazylak later, alright? He's in jail. We'll stop bothering you. Goodbye. Miss. Who was that? A scrap dealer. Okay, I'm full. Now you can fuck me. Hi, Franz. Krawek asked about you yesterday. Hi, I'll get in touch with him. What's wrong? You don't want me? You won't drive me back, will you? I don't know what I'll do. Then why did you get me out? Maybe so that fucker wouldn't fuck you. If so, then you're 22 days late. Do you have a home? A family? They say that my father is a priest. You? I have a wife. In the US. She left me. Stupid bitch. She took my son. I also have a brother in Auckland, in New Zelaland. Then what are you doing here? Are you asking about my wife, or my brother? About your son. I'm cleaning up the mess. Your car is nice. It's my wife's. I don't think a pig could afford it. What else did she leave you? Nothing. She took everything. Why did she leave you? Simply because... she was a bad woman. And you're guilt-free. I'm a saint! It's a pity, because... Do you want anything else? Those motherfuckers sent me a committee... A planning committee! They're taking my summer home apart. They want to check if it really is waste material. They want invoices! Who the fuck keeps invoices for so many years? You said you had them yesterday. Olo, fuck off right now! Cheers. In Łódź the committee fired just 20% of staff. And in fucking Krakow they fired 70%. I always said we should have taken them to a forest. When we still had time. Hear, hear! Companies of compact units, some sand... And a lot of bags. This is inedible. Dog cutlet...worst quality. Minced with the kennel. Minced with a bitch! They won't throw all of us out. They need a secret police. Whatever its name will be...what!? Will they hire Jesuits? Their own men will form the secret police. We will at most walk the beat. If only... You have it well. You're young, and me? Will I even get a handshake? Where can I find a job now? I only know how to interrogate. The Polish Records. Become a headhunter. Well, finish the bottle and go home. There's a fire on tonight. Is there a lot? Well, about three trucks. Captain, Sir. Second Lieutenant Morawiec Waldemar from Szczytno... Okay, okay. You got any papers? Yes, sir. I'm glad you're joining us, and so on, but... I've got enough men. The best. But no jobs to do. Why do this, boy? Start a business. A weapon store... Or a sex shop! His father-in-law was a dictator and a louse! Then fucking do something about it! Welcome to the mafia. Franz, you've drunk the least... You're seeing the boss wih me. The rest of you, to beds. So that you don't complain tonight. Kaniewski, get up! We're the police! The secret police! Tonight we burn our whole bloody past. They carried him on a door Through Świętojańska Against the cops Against the tanks We bravely stood We hit our targets Janek Wiśniewski's down Janek Wiśniewski's down Janek Wiśniewski's down You know each other, no need for introductions. Yes. I have told Captain Stopczyk my surname eleven times throughout the last fifteen years. Stopczyk. What are you lighting up there? Me? Radomskie. But Franz has Camels if you like them better. What the fuck are you talking about, Stopczyk? At the dump! What are you burning during the night? Just some papers... The building will go to the National Health... So we're burning invoices for clothing, for cleaning supplies, office supplies... I know it's supposed to be recycled but who will take all of it? Let me tell you something, Sir- it was a secret. Stopczyk, you're testing your luck here. Stop cracking jokes. The gentlemen are saying that... you're burning files. What files? Major, do you want to convince us with this farce? Hieronim. Waldek. Tell everyone what they've been talking about. Captain Stopczyk, along with the officers present here, made plans 15 minutes ago during a drinking bout in the cafeteria to burn operational files. Tonight, in an unknown place. What do you say to that, Stopczyk? I can't believe it. Me neither. What is your reply? Olo...Do you smell it? Yeah... Doesn't smell like shit though. Smells more like carrion. When a guy starts with snitching... where will he end up? On the cementery. You know what? This is a fucking disgrace! Outrageous. It's a threat to his life! I demand the immediate suspension of those officers! You're going down. And you're shitting yourself. They're gonna fire us. With no mercy. Don't worry, though. We'll open a gun store. You know who'll give us the permit? The bald guy from downtown... Wolski. He had a second heart attack. He's on a sick leave. Then a sex shop. I'll never forget his face, though! Any trouble? I couldn't handle the lock. I need to put stickers on your keys. Let me introduce you two. Olo... Angela. 'Sup, Olo? 'Sup? Angela. Olo is really nice, right? Really funny. Are you old friends? Yeah. He didn't treat me like a brat. Not even once. Even though you're the same age, or older... Oh my...That's not what I wanted to say. You get me? Jesus...You're so beautiful. Franz, let's sleep together. It's stupid that we're in separate beds. Don't make me beg you. You won't be disappointed. You'll see. Come on. At least once. No. Why? Because... I don't really trust you. And I don't really love you. God...It's just sex. Don't be so pious. Woah, calm down! You're disgusted by me. Because I slept with all those guys. No... I would be disgusted with myself if I did it to you. Get it? Then, later? In ten years... Will you love me? You'll be the first to find out. How? Go. Go to bed. Nice gear, Waldek. You got it from the department? No, a friend. I borrowed it. Why? Oh, a friend...You got any? Yes. Hey... Be careful, it wasn't cheap. Wasn't cheap? Jesus...Jesus Christ! You fucking...you! What the fuck? Are you insane? Jesus...you're all fucked in the head! You all cannot be prosecuted! You need therapy! Throwing my camera... What the fuck do you think this is, punk? A joke? That we want some shitty cushy jobs? Huh? This is about life, get it? How old are you, huh? What do you want to do? Kill fifty thousand agents and whistleblowers? Is that what you want? You need blood, you fucking punk? When you grow up... you'll understand that politics is not on the news. Politics is us, here, at this dump! Either we get out, or we stay forever! Get it? You've gone mad. Get it? Get it, fucker, or not? You missed from this distance? Get it? The fuck are you looking at? We're not here! I think I'll go now. No point in me sitting around. Did you witness it when Lieutenant Żwirski used a gun against one of our new officers at the city garbage dump? I don't know anything about that. Ask Olo. He will know best who he killed recently. Do not give me advice. You're the one answering questions. Not me. Times change, but you're always the one asking questions. Are you ready to guard the rule of law of the reborn, democratic Republic of Poland? Absolutely. Until the very end. Mine or hers. What's up? Did I ever lock you up? Took a bribe and didn't follow the request? What did I do that you just sat down as if we were friends? They fired... Yes. They let everybody stay... and they kicked me out. But I still know enough people to have you locked up. Whisky with coke. Do you have a golden watch, too? Then I will have you locked up. You can't. I was your senior. Wait, wait. You're from Lublin. Your name's Gross. Major. We don't have what you wanted. Is vodka okay? I've got a job for you. What kind of a job? You're not asking for money first? Tell me what kind of a job it is, and I'll tell you my price. You'll speak differently after a year of unemployment. I'm a mechanic. I don't have to live in poverty. I've never heard about any of us getting a job. Maybe as a bouncer... We've done worse things, no? And where's Franz Mauer? Celebrating his service for the new masters. So they didn't fire him... Down with the Church. Down with them. The Church and the communists. Down with all. That's pretty, no? I can drink with you for that. Hey. I made us dinner. Tenderloin. But everything's gone cold by now. I'm sorry. I was drinking with my friends. They transfered us to Criminal Affairs. Without Olo. That's bad. Well, just for Olo. You should go to school. Everyone will fuck me again. That's a point against school. You're jealous. Shut up! How do you like my seventeen-year-old body? You're an old hag! Why did she leave you? My wife? Because she was a bitch. I told you already. I don't know why I like you. I think it's your smile. Smile! What is this, listeners' choice? Please. I don't wanna! I will never leave you. Can I finish my breakfast? You're the police, right? And you're from Stasi... You must be mistaken. You wanted to meet the Słaby brothers. With 'Big Marian' and Zenon. To introduce them to a new courier. The other one was killed, after all. Just between us, the same will happen to the new one. Please remain calm. This set-up is starting to make me feel bored, officer. Brothers Słaby have prepared 25 kilograms of amphetamine for you. You will lose the product, the contact, and the money. 200 thousand German marks. Isn't that so? And your friend? Won't he say anything funny? Germany, Germany, above all else. My name is Major Pien, and I'm a major. Since yesterday, you're my subordinates, and I am your boss. You're in the police now. Not the secret police! Do you know the difference? In the secret police, you did nothing and you got a lot of money for it, and in the police you will have to work all the time for nothing. Nobody will have 30 reprimands here! Because after the second one he'll be kicked out. And no general will help. Waldek, put the plan up. Mauer, shut the doors. We're taking down a gang of car smugglers tonight in a motel. They steal cars in Germany and smuggle them to Russia. It's huge money. If any of you takes a cut... I will push it so deep down their throat that it will come out of their ass. Well? What about the doors? I can hold out for a day or two. But will you? He'll be good, right? Listen...when and where will you be collecting the amphetamine? Talk! Talk! Talk! When and where! Talk! When? When and where? When and where? When and where? It would be funny if the chink couldn't speak any German. I'll make him fucking learn! Pretty spot for a house, right? After we kill the courier tomorrow, you'll fucking buy everything. Including the river. Up to those chimneys. You think he didn't lie? Nobody lies with a car battery on their balls. He held out a long time. Tough guy. He won't float up? They never did. Franz? Franz! This is Jerzyk. Come in. Franz, coming in. Over. Nothing's happening. He's on his 10th cigarette. Franz, this wind is killing me. Send someone to take over. Over Ask the new guy. It's his operation. Over and out. I'm not asking that snitch for anything. He can kiss my ass. Guys from high school were the best to take down. You know how scared they were. I said one fucking word, and they packed everything up. Flyers, paint. And it's confiscated. Unless they were girls... They always have big mouths... Guys knew that we would beat them up sooner or later, but them...I don't know... Maybe they thought they could make it? Jeez, the wind is blowing. Were you ever blown in such weather, friend? Like that time I gave backup to Walter in Babi Most... It was just as windy. Mister Franz! Lieutenant, sir! I have your coffee! Lieutenant, sir! Your coffee's going cold! Wow, you really scared me, sir. -What are you shouting for? -I brought you coffee. It's going cold. Thanks. You probably don't remember, but we, in that bloody downpour... took down an antenna on a block of flats on Mokotowska street. In October of 1982. And you transferred to Criminal Affairs? You don't work too much... I used to see my locked up buddies on Rakowiecka. I didn't know what to do with the eyes. Theirs? Poke them out! And if you keep shouting like that... during an operation, they will transfer you to traffic! Nice. Oh fuck... Bastard...Let's get him! You have no right! I'm a professor of political science! And his dick hung to his knees... Oh, don't exaggerate. Yeah! I've never seen a bigger one. Oh, as if you've seen many! Franz! Franz! What a mess! Goddamn punks! What the fuck? The war has ended. Maybe you'll check, friend? Maybe it's a new idea of your bosses... Finally! What's up? He turned off the light, he either left, or he's in the dark! So run, man! Go check! We're taking him down! What the fuck! By myself? We'll catch up, I need to round everybody up first! Fuck this mess! I was already grabbing the drawer... and that bitch fought, because she saw my cap on a hanger! We're taking him down. Maybe more will come? Gentlemen, move your asses, Jerzyk is alone! Student! Student! What's up? Get Mauer! We're taking him down. He's making a call. Then get him here! What the fuck is this, a picnic? Where's Młody? In the bar. Waiting for hamburgers. Ah, there he is. Młody, get rid of that, go look for Franz! Wait until I fucking finish! Right now! That's an order! That punk feels uppity... Even though he's had enough of our booze. Student! Where is Franz? He's making a call! Then get him here! You're closer! Franz! Open up. We're the police. Stop causing a scene and open the door! You want to be embarassed? Want me to wake people up? Open up, or I'll get the key from reception! Are you on a trip? -At work, you wet blanket. -But you can't afford it to find out. Girls. Just wait. Let me do it, son. Police! Open up! Open up, or we'll force the door! Oh God... I just couldn't reach you the whole... day. Mlody! But I don't have a gun! Jesus, it's at the gunsmith! Come on, Mlody, we're going in! I don't have a gun! I don't have a fucking gun! -Mlody, what's the code? -No fucking idea! Give me the gun! I'm fucking having mine fixed! -Jesus, leave it! -Let me go! Shut the fuck up! This is Hotel One. Mlody! The clip! What are we going to do? How the fuck should I know? Where's the room? Wait...In the front, second floor, around the corner. Franz, listen. Okay...kill anyone with a gun. But I've never shot anyone! For fuck's sake, kill every armed motherfucker before he kills me! Got it? Okay. Twenty years...an award... the director invited me... fuck...for outstanding work... I want an office! I can use the typewriter well! I want a fucking office! I could be useful! I know all printers, border checkpoints, couriers... I know the whole opposition! There is no opposition! They're your fucking bosses now! They killed Grandpa. Fuck this. What is going on here? What the fuck is this? What the fuck is going on? Am I supposed to die for 3 million? Fuck that! They shot at me! Get it? What are you looking at? I didn't go to college for this! Not for...getting shot at! What the fuck is this? I don't give a shit! What's going on? You fucking slow down! They're shooting at us! Listen to me! They're coming for me. Over and out. Stop or I'll shoot! Oh God... Well. It's not bad. Not bad at all. Jerzyk has just a broken clavicle, his colleagues donated blood, he should regain consciousness soon. You will be able to talk to him. Ma'am, Kazek has lost a piece of his ear. And, well...it's difficult to communicate, but the doctor, world-class specialist, says it's just a matter of days until he comes out of PTSD. Młody...I mean, Krzysiu, is a bit worse. But the doctors are doing all they can. I'll kill you, you motherfucker. Calm down! Fuck this! I'll be calm in my fucking grave! You know why they're dead? You know? You know why? Grandpa and Student? Fuck! Because that dickhead went away to make a phone call! Get it? He had to make a phone call! And he wasn't on his fucking post! If only you'd seen... Shut up! I beg you, shut up! Don't even fucking try to open your mouth! Get it? Nobody will ever die because of you, Soviet scum! Nobody! Anymore! Nobody! Nobody! I'll file a complaint. I will not accept it. You don't snitch on your colleagues! I'll take care of all of you. Will you stop if it hurts? Stop kidding. -Will you stop? -Let me in. Is that it? All of it? Baby...hold me. Not with your hands, silly... I can't. Hold me. Like so? Love me, Franz... Meow. What? I liked it. Hey there. Sorry I'm late. What's up? Grandpa and Student are dead, Młody will die any moment... Kazek has gone insane, and Jerzyk is gravely wounded. We went to Hotel Max to take some car smugglers down... But they weren't car smugglers. They shot at us as if it was a shooting range. The guy we were watching... They cut him open, poked his eyes out, cut his tonge out.... They knew we were cops... and they still shot at us. As if we were dogs. Olo, they're dead. What's everyone saying back there? Pień is writing justifications for the use of firearms... in a public place. Olo, in every normal country those fuckers would already be dead. Shut up. What's your plan? I'm out. The new guy wrote that it's all my fault. Olo, this is a chance for you to come back. Who was the guy they killed? Some Dutch guy. Apparently dealt amphetamine. There's a rumor that two years ago he was a citizen of East Germany... and a Stasi officer. Do you remember Jaworski? Yeah, some weird guy, always used to go to East Germany. They fired him. I'll ask him. This is the factory, where the Słaby brothers... make the most popular amphetamine in the West right now. They're the only ones since Stasi left the market. Who told you? Jaworski. You know him? Yeah. I head he took huge bribes from amphetamine dealers. It's probably as true as Franz being ordered to shoot the Pope. You'll ask him yourself soon. Olo doesn't believe you took bribes from them. I don't believe it myself. I took 12 thousand bucks a year. Now it's time to take it all. Your mom? This the cost of a portion of amphetamine at the Flohmarkt in Berlin. Pure business, pure profit. Yeah. And they'll just let it go. They've been unlucky lately. Someone killed their courier. They lost the money and the product. The Slaby brothers' clients are very bored. -What bosses? -Why do you care? They are very dependable people. Currently in Moscow. They'll visit us soon. The Slaby Brothers... how much can they make? As much as we need. Ten, twenty, thirty thousand... A dirty business. But a clean profit. It's dirty here. You need a new flat. You will go to Krakow with prosecutor Nawrocki. You will meet with prosecutor... -Zurawski. -Czaplinski! I'm Nawrocki. Zwirski. You will sell a 'Three Elephants' lottery ticket to mr Czaplinski. -For how much? -The normal price. Five thousand. How much will he win? A hundred million. You will ask mr Czaplinski to let the chemist go before the 1st of next month. He will know what it's about. Do you like the flat? Then go. Nice car, right? Mr Gross said he will sell it to me for 40 million. 3 liter engine, a turbocharger, and it's like a rocket! They're in a real hurry with getting the chemist, no? Since they're so generous... Before, they used to let people go for half of that sum. Or the files got lost... And our hearts were too soft! Hey, focus on the road, okay? Why are you so nervous? They're in a hurry because the boss from Moscow is coming. They're afraid he'll do business with the Slaby brothers and not them... Imagine- tons of money! I can't even imagine them lying in a bank. Take me away from those punks... And put me back on the case. Who are you? You and your Soviet friends... Stop treating me as a Soviet, start treating me like a cop! Nobody treats you like a cop. Even the ones who shot at you because nobody shoots at policemen. You're just a snitch. Taken away from his lords. For 30 years people like you and Olo used me! People spat on my uniform! And now, none of you will even clean my ashtrays. Go to bed, Franz! Pien! Me and Olo will be back! -Is there a mortgage on the house? -I don't know. -And where is the mortgage register? -I don't know. Angela! Franz! It's good you're here. They came from America. They want to buy your house. Is this place yours? My wife's. I'll put the kettle on. Do you have any money? About five million. How much do you earn? Three...four with overtime. That's a lot. It's okay for the two of us. Do you want more? No... It's a pity about the car, though. It was nice. Don't cry, silly... I never liked that house. We'll be in paradise here. Fuck, we've been doing so well... Do you want to leave me? Do you love me? Then what is this about? Here are the Slaby brothers. One's shorther than the other, right? You tell us when the chemist will be free. On the 26th. Gentlemen, something is going on. Follow them. The Big Slaby will be easy to convince, but Zenon... He's a tough guy. What are you talking about? I'm saying that Zenon Slaby is stubborn. And nothing can convince him. But if we killed him... Then the Big Slaby wouldnt be so big, either. By the way. Who's doing it? He, who will later go to Amsterdam with the product. How much? 25 thousand portions, 100 each. You want me to do it? Stop next to the bay. Have you ever killed a man from up close? Okay, I'll do it. Keep the car. It's legit. On the 27th, you will pick the Chemist up from the hotel and you will bring him to your place. Understand? Nothing can happen to him. If the Slabys find him, there will be a slaughter. I'm sorry. I'm always late since they took my car. I took Angela to her friend's place too. You're guarding her. Guarding? No. Taking care of her. I never thought that after Milena.... I would be taking care of a woman in my age... See, Olo? I really love her. That little punk. Sorry. Take my Wartburg. I won't be needing it now. Thanks. What's happened? Tonight Jaszczak Stanislaw will check in. His real name is Roman Bluszcz. He's a chemist. A pharmaceutics specialist. You will take him down. But be delicate. Make sure nobody sees you. Hold him for a week. That's a long time. Talk with Jablonski. He will keep him in the jail. Jablonski is a scrooge. He won't do it for free. Besides, I'm... Be careful, Olo. Once they find out who you were, they will kill you. Lock the chemist up. I'll take care of the rest. Olo. Set him up. No. I don't know everything yet. We'll take care of them later. Both of us. Now make the chemist disappear. No. I'm not doing this. Who was your father? You read my files, smart guy. He caught Marchwicki. So what? He was the best detective in this country. Stop it! Do you think I'm a child? You think those sob stories will work on me? There is a guy in this hotel who can lead us... to those motherfuckers. Are you going in, or just holding the door open? Listen, you commie... Okay, I got it. What a beautiful place! When you get bored, you can transfer to the archives. If people find out, they'll fire you. Don't count on me covering for you. The archives! -No, but, you know... -Shut your trap! It's here. Fuck, who are you? A whore. And you? Hey! Get outta here! Police! Bluszcz. What's going on, man? You should be in jail. I have a heart condition. Call an ambulance. Stop lying, motherfucker. You have no heart. You sent your brother to die! An ambulance, please! Franz! Leave him, he's ill. I need a doctor. Franz, let's call the ambulance. It's a heart attack. You'll kill me. Die! Who cares? Stop it! What the fuck are you doing? He's got a fucking heart attack! I'll make it. You won't. Who got you out? Who? If I tell you, they will kill me. If you don't tell me, I'll kill you. Who got you out? Nawrocki. Prosecutor Nawrocki. Ask him. Hello! May God be with you. Could I talk to prosecutor Nawrocki, please? He's ill. He's in a clinic. I think it's a stroke or something... Can you stop smoking? You're scaring the birds away. I'll leave him a notice. When he gets better, he needs to get in touch with us. Are you from the animal shelter? Yeah. We're the animals. You're late. The police have caught the Chemist. You must be fucking kidding me. Fucking hell! The chemist has to be free! You motherfucker! Who brought him in? I heard it was Franz. All of you can go... You'll pay him ten thousand. He may not go for that. He's here. Who is it? The guy with flowers. Neither they, nor the Slaby brothers, can know anything about the Chemist. Get it? Hey! Listen to me! Tell Franz that either the chemist will be free, or he will be dead. Franz is your friend. Nah...we just like each other. The auditor spoke with the Slaby brothers today. They don't know about the chemist. But we can't wait. You know... It's him. Who's the lady? Nobody. Just a whore. Franz...fell in love with her. What do you mean, 'fell in love'? He loves her, yeah? Do you know her well? We met once or twice for dinner at Franz's place. In that case, Olo, talk with Franz. And sort the chemist out. Because otherwise we'll have to sort Franz out, you know? And meet her. Maybe she loves him, too... That would help us. The red ones are gone... the black ones came... and they changed the brothel into a circus. With trained animals running in circles. And then I saw... Student's body... with two bullets in the head... Student had the courage to leave... and become an ordinary cop. Just a little bit more, if I can. Have you ever thought about... money? A lot of money. And about getting them. A million dollars, for example. Olo... If we don't stop those sons of bitches... then it will mean that we really are too old for this. And that our place is at the garbage dump. What are we good for? If we're not policemen, then we're nobody. Why? Some people are born priests, some are born whores... and some people are born thieves. Sometimes it's good, because you can recognize each other. I am not one. Right? Stupid shit. What do you want? A coffee. Hey, buddy... Tell the one one in a grey suit by the table with the bird to come. The one with his back to us. What about Franz? Will he let him go? No, he will not. I'll speak to him a bit more. This time I'll do the talking. Hello? Meow. Hey there, baby girl... Who are you meowing for? You know. No, I don't. Tell me. No, I won't. Just say it. I'm old, you know... I won't get sad. You know. No, I don't. Come on... Who is it? I won't shout. Don't be afraid. I know you won't shout. You never do. Who is it? -You know. -Who? Olo. I don't want to talk to you. Is this something serious, Tadziu? Very serious. Come on, come on. You wanted to speak with me? -I don't have too much time... -We'll make it. Alone. I don't understand. I work for Siwy. Do you understand that? We need to search you. The auditor can't do business with both. He will have to choose... He will pick Siwy. Siwy gives a better cut, the transport is safer... and he has the best pharmaceutist in the world. The chemist? We've been looking for him everywhere, but Siwy hid him somewhere. I have the chemist. How much? A million. For ten thousand, I'll have the best Western specialists working for me. A million not for his work, but for his eyes. My brother won't agree. But I'll try to convince him. I'm afraid you'll have to make this choice by yourself. -I'm sick. -Where's Nawrocki? -He didn't come? -Where is he? In the government hospital. If he didn't come, he has to be there. What are you doing, Franz? I don't know. Why? What? Never seen a dead body before? Put him away! See? They're already talking. Apparently he was important. A long time ago. We're here. Franz, we're here! Will you have some vodka? Huh? I was joking. Maybe we should go back? Why? I don't fucking know, Franz was being weird. Kanieski, drive me home. And if you have hunches, then go back yourself. Drive! Oh fuck. Well, mister Nawrocki? Are you hanging in there? What's going on? A surgery? No. It's not worth it anymore. I will call the nurses. You'll break my fingers! You thug! Definitely not here. I know a better spot. This will be great. Do you know a guy called Bluszcz? I'm not the one who let him free. He wasn't set up by me. It was a coincidence, or maybe the work of someone else. I have a summons from the police. I can show it. You don't have to! I sent it to you! You? You're from the police? I'll file a complaint with the prosecutor's office, mister...? What's your name? Come on, show me your badge. It will be your last time. Know that Brezhnev is dead and your so-called state is over... Who told you to get Bluszcz out of jail in Krakow? I will not testify under such circumstances. -Who? -This is the first time in twenty years... -...I have seen such abuse of power... -Who? -and misuse of public trust! -Who? ...you damn commies! No...no... No! No! Who? Olo Zywiecki brought the money... I was the driver. Ask Olo Zywiecki. I'm dying. Die. On the 30th of the current month... once again, Franciszek Mauer testified before the commision. Our research indicates that he is unable to... guard the rule of law in a newly reborn Polish state and fill the honourable post of a police officer. And as such, he is fired immediately. Mister Mauer... Please wait! I haven't finished, mr Mauer! We are launching a case against you! A present. Thanks. I don't have anything to play it with, anyway. No hurry, you'll listen to it when you get out of here. I'm sorry you lost your job. New guy... Thanks for coming back then. Us pigs need to stay together. Franz. I'll be replacing you. I know. Put me on the other pile. You're late. You look great, Franz. Want some? Sorry to hear you lost your job. Then again, one commie less. I need a gun. Yeah. I had to give mine back. Listen, Franz, why are you setting me up? Calm down! Now I'm just a thug! You're so stubborn. Get in! Fuck off, or I'll call the police. I'm the police! You're nobody. Get in before I break your skull! You've fucking gone mad. You want to kill me in broad daylight? There's a hundred witnesses here. You think you can scare me, you clown? I think I'll kill you if you don't get in. You wanted to have a word with me? Excuse me, but I will be working. It's urgent. I'm making a coffin for my brother. You speak, and I will listen. They have the advantage. They have connections and experience. They can find, track, plan, and kill. They are trained men. They were good secret officers. They belonged to the biggest mafia in the world. It's a typical job for them, but... it's the most you can expect out of your boys with shotguns. What's your advice? Teach those commie officers a lesson. Make them bother someone else. That's why you've brought me the chemist. There is no need to bury him. He needs to be bought. That's impossible. He will be afraid of those other guys. I will take care of them. I will get rid of them for half a mil. By yourself? By myself. How will you do it? I will kill them all. Good evening. Is everything fine? Hello, Sasha. Do you have the gun? And what is that, a hoover? Who is that? A mister with a briefcase. It's probably for his dad. Dad, there's someone with a briefcase to see you! Let's invite him in! Get dressed, we're having guests over! I have nothing to wear. If you don't like my clothes, buy me other ones. What's up? The auditor wants to see the factory. There's nobody here! They're not welcoming us. That's not very Polish. Let's get the fuck out of here. What did he say? That we need to run. This is a trap set by the police. Comrade, we're not paying you this much to have the police set traps on us. Get the Great Brother. I don't have time. The plane leaves at six. Come! You have a guest from Moscow! Great Brother! Don't make me feel ashamed. Get the fuck out. He, who dies... remains dead. Franz...don't be silly. We are friends! We've known each other for 20 years! You think I'm the killer? It wasn't me, it was that madman! I only made the motherfucker pay his dues. I beg you, Franz, calm down! You said yourself that we need to clean the mess up. You think I betrayed anyone? I betrayed no one! Especially not you, Franz! After all...they wanted to kill you a few times, and I wouldn't let them! Franz...What was I waiting for? I was doing the same thing you were! Was I supposed to wait for the judge? I jumped to their motherfucking throats. You're fucking... No, I'm not fucking you! I swear! You're fucking my woman. Why? In the name of rules, motherfucker. Meow. Huh? It's me. Who? Angelika. I don't want to talk to you.
