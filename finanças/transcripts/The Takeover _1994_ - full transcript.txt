You didn't bring me Kathy. I asked you. And you killed two of my men. Probably would've fired them anyway-- anybody stupid enough to bring me the wrong target. Now, you two ladies, you got one chance... To walk out of this place alive. When, uh, Anthony vilachi appears, which should be momentarily, I want Jonathan and, uh, Mickey... To take him out for me. Then what ? "Then what" ? Then what ? Then, you just gather up your little loved ones... And you just live happily ever after. That's it ? That's it. I ever lie to you, Jonathan ? [ Puffing ] Take the girls. [ Imitates gunshot ] It's okay. It's okay. Why's he coming here ? He's worried... About his fishing boat. Drugs. We're gonna need our guns. [ Exhales ] What do ya think ? I think that they're two very determined young men. But, uh, keep the girls ready just in case. [ Stein ] Well, this is it, gentlemen. When it starts, you move. When the containers and the trucks are in here, you shut it down. Nobody gets in, nobody gets out. [ Sighs ] I can't believe I caused this. I warned you. Now you know what I was trying to get away from. How do you know we can even trust this guy ? God ! I say we go back and get that motherfucker now ! Do something crazy like that, Cindy and Kathy will be dead before we get a shot off. Now get it together ! Let's, uh, load this truck. Come on. Over here. Beautiful. [ Gunfire ][ Gasps ] "Be not envious of evil men." Vilachi's time is over. The end of an era. [ Gunfire ] [ Shotgun blasts ] Every one of Danny's guys is out there. - Now's the time. - Give the signal. [ Honk, honk, honk ] These are Tony's guys ? That fuckin' manu ! That bastard's still working for vilachi ! - We underestimated Tony. - Yeah ? You just go get the girls. Tony. Kathy ! Shit ! They're in the middle ! Now what ? I can get a shot.Wait. It's too dangerous. Hey ! Vilachi. This is your last chance. Last chance for what ? You won't get outta here alive. Neither will Kathy. You'll be pullin' your own trigger ! I don't mind. Shoot 'em ! Move out of the way. [ Softly ] Kathy ! Kathy, come on ! No, Tony. [ Screaming ] I guess-- I guess you get your rest-- restaurant back... Like I PR-promised. [ Panting ] Is it over yet ? It's over. Let's go home. Closed-captioned by captions, inc. Los Angeles
