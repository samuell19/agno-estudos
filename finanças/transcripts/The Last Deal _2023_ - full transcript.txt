- What do you know about marijuana? What do you think you know? It's come a long way since dime bags and Cheech and Chong. The starters is becoming a 200 billion dollar industry as well as the number one agricultural crop in California. I'm a dispensary owner in Los Angeles, meaning, I sell weed, and California knows about it. We don't call it marijuana anymore, though. It's called flower, like the plant you give your mother or cannabis. That's Franco, a working-class dude just like the rest of us, except he grows for one of the best suppliers in LA. - Looks good. - I know. You'd be bounded too if you saw the profit margin on this stuff. The demand was so high I had to hire delivery drivers. You show ID, you get your weed. It was that simple. No longer have to feel like a schmuck doing deliveries in my car. The money was just pouring in. It was like the wild west and the heavy one was staking their claims. We even called it, the green rush. Here's a normal day buying wholesale. Flying the Cessna was my buddy, Cada. I'd meet him at Santa Paula Airport at 9 AM and we could either go to Humboldt County or Inland Farm County by 11. Today, we're going Inland. When I started as a grower 5 years ago, I never would have imagined it would turn out to be something like this. Farming technology has advanced immeasurably, and these Inland growers have given the folks in Humboldt a run for their their money. They're harvesting buttloads of stuff in the desert. Think of the sand where water doesn't exist. - Man, the crops are great this year. - Thank you, this is tricom production like donkey dicks. - At noon, I buy a barrel straight from one of the friendly local growers, have it packed into a van and driven down to LA. Why bother growing it when it's as easy to get your hands on this stuff? You see that plastic bag? That's 50 pounds of dried bud and behind me, a 197 barrels full of them. Street value, $19 million. You could fit a small body in one of those barrels. I hop back on a plane, shoot back to LA, buy a couple of bags off the runway just because I could. And then I'm back in time to grab a late lunch at Santa Monica. I had this down to a science. Keep in mind, absolutely none of this was federally legal. I met this young kid, Bobby, at court. He was there for beating up this guy who beat up his little sister. Good kid and he came with some valuable skills. Just the kind of guy I needed. We quickly bonded and after a few months, he started working for me. He also worked in collections. So I asked him to do the job they didn't want to do anymore. On the streets, where there are no rules, it's important people respect you and pay their debts on time. I was never a dealer before and I still don't consider myself as one. It was only after my mother and me moved out west that I started growing vegetables for some sort of therapy. I was pretty good at it so I stopped picking the weeds and started growing them. The money was so good that I stop growing altogether and just sold it. No longer that I need a plan B, this was my only plan. So how could something so right go so wrong? - We want to turn to the historic night here in California. What affects you the most? - Yeah, voters legalized the recreational use of marijuana. Here's a look at the Prop 64 results. - You think weed turning legal would be a good thing. Think again. My sales tank, my drivers are leaving, and I can't get a dispensary license even though the state promised thousands of them. So then, people started telling me, "Get a loan. Try to stay afloat." Not a chance. Cannabis may now be legal on a state level but not on the federal level. Things won't even give you a lollipop for walking through the front door and nonetheless a loan. - Of course, there was money involved in it. This is politics. Politics, pot, money, okay? - Then the big shot politicians add testing regulations which up all the prices for everyone. Look, I get it. California wants to be legit and people want safe weed but the folks growing your genetically modified breakfast cereals, have less red tape to cut through than my industry. So I'm forced to pay off these shady cameras inspectors, back alleys, just so I can stay open. Maybe it's time to pull up the stakes and move on because the end of the green rush was within sight. - I think I need a plan B. - You just got to get your swagger back. - Who said I lost my swagger? - You got this. - Someone had an order? - You're the delivery guy? - Marcus here? - Yeah. Come in. - Marcus, the delivery guy is here. - I got this, ladies. - Delivery guy. - You ordered an ounce? - Yes, I did. - I need a card and ID. - What are you talking about? - ID, I need to make sure it's you. - Here we go like the only company with some shit, man. - Yeah, I do. - Fine, yeah. Yeah, my bad. Hey, Britney! Britney, bring my ID up here. Please. Girls, man. Right? - So this place is yours, huh? - Yeah, man. Yeah. Paid in full. Very sick, huh? Hey, thank you. Lastly, my card. - Got it. - There's that. - Alright. - Appreciate you. Okay, hold on a minute, I have a tip for you. That's balcony for my show tonight. Come through, man. Good times, bring a friend. Lots of girls. - Yeah. - Bye. - Let's get high. - Hey, thanks for meeting up. - You bet. - Just to be clear, this is going to cover all my unregulated products and no bureau coming by for routine checks. - Why do you want to ask me specific shit like that, man? Makes me feel like you're tapped. - Are you serious? - You got the cash? Come here. - Here. - Okay. This will cover you for 6 months. No regulations will be enforced. - Yeah, but I can sell any flower I want. - Yes. Just don't be stupid. I still have to come by for inspections. - But only you, right? I don't want to have to pay off any other inspectors, again. - Only me. - Hey, what about my dispensary license? - What about it? - When's it going to get approved? - You still got your delivery license, right? - Yeah, but my business, it depends on the dispensary license. - I don't make the rules of the state, buddy. I just enforce them. Keep applying. - What's up? - The AC is broken again, Vince. - Get off your phone. - Look, I don't know. - You had 10. You come back with 7 and the money for 2? - It must have gotten lost. - What is going on? - He lost a bag. - How big? - An 8? He's gonna break my arm. - Okay, Jesus, man. Let him go. - Are you serious? - Let him go. - Cumming, go look in your car. See if you can find it. - He smoked it. He's not going to fucking find it, Vince. - Just go look. - Thank you, Vince. - Get the fuck out of here. - What the fuck? He's our last driver. He's probably going to fucking quit. - That was his fourth time. You've got to let these people know who's running shit. - The guy's got a kid, for God's sake. - That's not my problem. We are running the business, right? - Where the fuck is Samson? He quit? - Yeah, he quit. Hey, look, I love you. You know this, right? I brought you in here as my partner to help. Right now, financially, we're getting fucking crushed. Okay? Hey, hey, just help us. Okay? - Fine. - Oh, dandelions. - Yeah, I feel like I've never been there. - Yo, I'm telling you. These regulations are killing us even with the help of the Cannabis Bureau. But I meant these Armenians that have good quality bud that we can buy. Cheap. - That quickly, huh? - I like Armenians. - And we can sell it for triple. I'm trying to set up a meeting. - How long you known these guys? - Not long. But they are all over the street though. - I get the feeling you're gonna set up no matter what. - What the fuck? - What are you looking at? - I've been looking for this motherfucker everywhere. Hold on. - Is he serious? - Here's Ricky. - Who's Ricky? - He's this Junior Agent with ICM. I'll be back. - You want some? - I'm good. Enjoy. - Hide this. I'll text you tomorrow with the Armenians info. - Really? - That was really good seeing you again. - Yeah. Thanks again. - No problem. Go ahead and give me a call. We'll set it up. - I will. Thanks again for helping. I appreciate it. - No problem. - Okay. - Hey, baby. - Hey, babe. What's going on? - I don't know. - That guy looks like he's injured. - Nah, you think so? - Yeah, we should probably get out of here. - That's a very good idea. - So are you going to meet with those Armenians? - I don't know. I got to find out some more information with these guys. - I mean you should. It'd be good for your business. - Don't worry about my business. I gotta handle this. - Okay. I mean I'm just looking towards the future. - Me too. Speaking of, what's up with Ricky with his suit jacket? - Ricky, he just wanted to talk to me, see if I was interested in a part. - A part? - Yeah, he saw my reel and was curious. I mean, what is this, 21 Questions? - No. I'm just curious. - No, you're not. You're probing. - Tab, I'm not probing. - Yes, you are. Fuck, Vince. - Hey, hey. I'm sorry, alright? I trust you. I- Things are just crazy right now. - Yeah, with work? I mean, I can tell. It's taken a toll on you and it's taken a toll on us. - Yeah, I know. - I don't think you do. I mean, why don't you let Bobby take over for a while? - What? No, no no. I think I've worked way too hard for this business. - You've done it all, baby. There's nothing left to prove. - Yeah. Come on. And, by the way. What the fuck was that the other night? - At the club? Silas. He's fine. I got him in the arm. - I thought your debt was settled? - They are. That's the good thing about capitalism. You get new ones. What did you do with the screwdriver? - I threw it in the park trash can. - Nice. - No, not nice. - Your partner brings me all kinds of new business. - Yeah, he's got a unique style. You want some Armenian coffee? - No, thanks. - It's the strongest thing you can drink around here. So, you're looking to buy some Humboldt weed? We can sell you 200 pounds. We don't really do anything less than that. - Okay, how much? - You're looking at about a hundred thousand dollars. - I know a lot of guys up in Humboldt. Who're you getting it from? - Excuse me? The 200 pounds of flowers' a lot, maybe I know the grower. - It's this hippie guy by the coast. - A lot of hippie guys by the coast. There's no buying any less? - My friend, this is a good deal. We can't sell you this for less. It'll cost us money. - Yeah, she's a big chunk of change. - Well, maybe you're in the wrong business then? Hmm? - Nah, I don't think that's the case. - What's your background? - Used to be a grower upstate. - Explains your questions. But what about before that? - I was a dancer. - I used to fight, box. - A boxer? Very cool. I love the barbaric nature of the sport. I hope you didn't get hit on the head too many times, because selling this will make you five times as much as what we are charging you. - So why don't you sell it yourself? - This isn't a negotiation. And you're starting to try my patience. - Vince. You can't do that man. You can't talk to them dudes like that. - What? I can't ask questions? - Yeah, you can. But look, they're giving us non-compliant weed that can't get sold, right? So you got the regulators on our side. Fortune favors the bold. - Yeah, it does. But we don't have that kind of money. - I can flip a hundred thousand in a week. We don't have it in the business? - No. Hey. Don't quit your side jobs. It's all here? - Just bring the bag back. -What? -Don't act like you don't know, alright? The bag. The black bag, no one ever brings them back. You know how much I spent a month on those things? - Is this really a thing? - Yeah, it adds up. So, how's business? - Slowly dying. You? - Less runs, mostly swapping out a legal flower for regulatory. Crazy how things change, huh? Guess it's just a matter of time, right? - I guess so. - I don't know. I think I will go back to growing. Maybe go back East on my own indoor. - Tabitha would move there? - No. I'm thinking, you know, maybe on my own for a while. Find someone more stable, less quincy. - What? Like you? Go marry that girl, Vince. If you are thinking of leaving, I got guys back East always looking to buy. - Really. - Yep. Just let me know. I'll make the contact. - Yeah, that'll be great. - Thanks. - Yeah man, you got it. Oh, wait a minute. Look at this. - I remember this day. Where'd you find this? - Some old box. It's the good old days, huh? - Yeah. - Back when you could kick my ass. - I could still kick your ass. - We're shutting down the business at the end of the summer. I ran the numbers. You sure you can flip this hundred grand? - Of course. I wouldn't have suggested it. - How well do you know these guys? - Pretty well. Known them for like a few weeks. We have some kind of relationship now. - Yeah, we need this deal. - I know. - Look, I want to talk to your guy. - My guy? - The big guy. The guy you collect for. - That guy? No, no way. That's out of the question. We can't do that, Vince. - Yeah, I don't see any more options. - Listen, Vince. You don't want to mess with these dudes. You saw what they had me do. What'd I do on the old what? Two Gs? - What other choice do we have? Let the place go broke? - I mean, it ain't got to be like that. - But it is. Look, I work my entire life. I'm in my 40s and I have nothing to show for it. I still live in an apartment. - Hey, apartments ain't bad. - Not to you, you're a kid. Just setup a meeting with your guy, okay? - This looks awfully suspect. - You said you wanted to meet. This is the meeting spot. Fellas. - I never heard from you the other day. - Uh, my phone died. - I need you to stay in contact with me. - Understood. - This is uh- - Vince. And you're here to borrow some money, ya? - Yeah. Maybe we can go talk about this in private? - You're amongst friends here. How much are you looking for? - A hundred thousand. - Hundred thousand dollars is a lot of money. - Yeah, I know. but we're good for it. - But I don't know you. Him, I unfortunately know. I'm going to need some sort of reassurance or collateral. Just in case you can't pay me back. - Then we're good for. - How much did you business make last year? - A quarter of a million dollars. - And lately? - Slightly less. - I don't like to lose Vince. - We'll get back to you. Bobby. Keep your phone on. - What the fuck? - I really appreciate you giving me time. - No problem. That's fine. But you're paying next time. - I sure hope so. - What's going on here? - Oh, hey Ricky was just telling me by. - What? - We went to the showcase tonight for actors. It was way too far for me to Uber back, so he brought me. - I should probably get going. - Yeah, you should. - I'm sorry, thank you. I appreciate it. Seriously? You just embarrass me like that? - What're you talking about? - He's trying to get me work. - It's not what he wants. - If you would look at your phone like you do for everyone else, you would see that I text you. Vince, I know you have a lot going on, but I want to feel like a priority to you. - You are a prio- - What's going on between us? - Nothing, we're fine. - Are we? - What are you talking about? - I just- Sometimes I just... I don't know. I feel like we're two different people. - Yeah, we are and that's why this works. - I just feel like it should be more. - Yeah, I agree. Maybe we both want things that we don't have right now. I'll be upstairs. - Yo, Vince. This is Bobby. So I talked to the guy, he said he's in. So it's your call if you still want to go through with this. If so, we meet up with him tomorrow. Let me know. - The terms are standard. One week to repay, 15% interest. If you can't pay it back, you put up collateral. - What kind of collateral? - Twenty five percent of your business for the next 10 years. - To recoup the interest. And I want your license. - My license? - Your delivery license. I hear it's worth 50,000. - Somewhat like 80. You want me to transfer my license? - Perhaps you feel like you've been treated unfairly. - Excuse us for a minute. - What're you thinking? - I don't know what the fuck to think. They don't have many choices. - You can walk away. - Fine, go broke? I lose the business If I can't pay him back. I lose if I don't borrow. Either way, fucked. You got the guy that can move this, right? - Yeah. We'll get it back in a week. Rest is ours. What's the problem? Is I see these people living their lives, you know? Nice family, good homes, good jobs, 401ks. Who want that? Tide walked around a few. Fortune favors the bold, right? Fuck it. Let's do it. - Fuck it. - My friends, welcome. I'm glad you came to your senses. Is that my money? - Got our flower? - It's in the back of that truck. It smells amazing. Telly's finest. Check it out. 200 pounds. If we're a little off on the weight, you can charge us. - It's all there? - Whoo! It smells good as fuck back here, man. -It's good stuff. - It's good shit, bitch. - I'll send someone for the truck. Don't scratch it. - You're not going to count it? - I trust you. Con velez. - We're taking a right, right here, right? - Alright. - I've been thinking about what I want to do with the money after we sell, man. - Yeah? What? You gonna have a party? -Oh, man. I want to give it to my sister. - That's kinda new. - Yeah, man. Hey, just give her an edge, you know? I mean, we can run this game for a while, but she needs to go to college, man. They won't be much, but it'll pay for a semester or two. - Someone's tagging along. Head on, Bobby. - This is the right thing to do. But I'm still doing our part. - Sure you are. - Hey, Franco. Thanks, brother. - No worries, man. Hey, I got a hot date tonight. She charges by the hour. - Have fun with that. - Hello. - Alright, we'll see you early in the morning. - 7 AM. 6:30 for you. - Let's get this money. - What's wrong? What's up? - You see the two dudes, across the street? - Yeah. - I don't know, maybe I'm just being neurotic. Probably just looking for hookers or get drugs or some shit. - Sure. - Yeah, it's nothing. - Hey, I'm going to head out. - Okay. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. Are we okay? - Yeah, yeah, we're okay. - Okay. I'll be out in a second. - Yo. Is Bobby coming? - Yeah, he's supposed to. - Alright. Well, let's go. - What? - What the fuck? Where's the truck, man? Is this a joke? This is a joke, right? - No, it's not a fucking joke. The gate was open. The gate was open! - What the fuck, man?! - It's alright, dude. Calm down. Whatever happened, I got it on camera. - Maybe one of your guys forgot to lock the doors. - Not a chance. - How do you know? - Because I'm the guy who locks it. - Okay. - Wait a second. Right here. Got it. Who the fuck is that? Never seen him before. He's coming out the back of the truck, man. It's not one of your guys? - No. - You didn't check all the barrels in the back of the van? - Fuck. I got to call Bobby. Fuck. Pick up, pick up, pick up. Fuck. Hey man, the weeds' gone. We're fucked, call me. Yo, Bobby? - Hello? - Is Bobby home? - Who are you? No, I have not seen him. You cannot just walk in here like this. - Bobby?! - Can I help you something? - No. Bobby! - Jackie, the door! - Oh. - Hey! - Do you know where Bobby is? - No, I don't know. He left this morning. - Did he say where he's going? - I don't know. He got a call when he left. Get the hell out of here! - Fuck! - Did he say you can come over? You just walk at people's houses like you own it? You just going to keep on walking, huh? Fucking white boys. - Hey. - Hi, can I help you? - Yeah, I'm looking for some guys who were doing business out of here the other day? - Oh. Um, whoever was here left. The lease was up yesterday. - Is there somebody else that has their, did they give their contact? Anything I can get? - We're a short-term lease company. So, I wouldn't know. - What somebody else? Like maybe there's another manager or like somebody else in the office? - Look, I don't know. - I mean, I'm sure there's somebody. - I'm so sorry, I can't help you. - Yeah. Okay, listen. I'm sure there's somebody there. - No, I need you to leave. - Okay. Hey, hey, hey. What the fuck is wrong? Hey! - How many days you have left? - Six? - Come on, man. That's crazy! Borrow it was less. - Where'd you get that? On his website? - Come on man, I'm fucked right now. - You're not fucked. You got to think, man. Watch the buds. Watch the buds, man. They get harvested next week. Who owes you money? - Bobby collected whatever little debt was owed. - See that's bullshit, dude. That's why we need safe banking. Growers, dispensaries can't get any kind of bank accounts. No loans, it's bullshit. - Fuck, man. I think I'm going to go talk to him. - Talk to who? - The guy! - And what? Tell him you can't pay him? - No, no. If he's a businessman, he's gonna want to work something out. - Yeah, break your legs. - Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system. - Fuck. - Vincent Spinano, welcome. Where's your partner? - Bobby couldn't make it. - He's a busy guy. What can I do for you? We had some complications, you and I. The exchange went well. We just got crossed and lost the product. - What do you mean lost the product? - It's gone. There's a guy in the back of the truck. We get back to the warehouse, he got out, drove off with it. - Like a trojan horse. - You think it was the guy that sold you the flower? - Yeah, it had to be. - Where'd they go? - I don't know. Went by their place, everyone was gone. - Is Bobby with you? - No. - And you've come here because you can't pay me back. - No, we're going to pay you back. - Well, you have a week. Where's the five days now? Surely you can come up with something by then. Maybe even a bit of story. - We got it on tape. - Should probably go to the police then, huh? - Look, I came by here to meet you face to face. We could work something out. Maybe renegotiate the payments or the terms. - I think you have me confused with a bank. You know what it's like if it gets out that I'm giving away, grace periods and amending deals? It makes me look soft. You know our street critters? - Yeah, of course. - Then stop fucking with me. - How do you know your partner is not involved in all this? - Nah, Bobby wouldn't do this. - He works with a lot of people, that guy. Find the guys, find your partner, you understand? - You have five days. - Yeah, okay. - Hey, Vincent. Plan on seeing Bobby? - Yeah, at some point. - I might have a deal for you. - Fuck, fuck! Pick up, pick up, pick up. Pick up. - No one is available to pick up- - What's wrong? - Nothing. - Doesn't look like nothing. - Just work stuff. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Okay, because I want to show you something but I don't want you to get upset. - Okay. - Okay. So, I've been thinking a lot about us and we're not getting any younger and I just needed some solid ground. So I took a test the other day, when you saw me. I mean, I just think this is a sign. Just promise you won't get mad. - Yeah, promise. - Look, after what happened today everything's downhill. - Okay. So the test, it came back a little faint. So I took another one today. And before I even looked at it I just thought, what is it that I want to see? I don't know if it's right but - Shit! Shit! Shit! Hey! Where the fuck have you been? Are you alone? Yeah. Fine. I'll see you there in 10. - Hey. - Where the fuck have you been, man? - This wasn't supposed to happen. Alright? - Are you working with these guys? - Yes, but not on our job. Alright, they fucked me. But I swear I didn't know man. - You don't know what the guys in the back of the truck. - No. They were rolling over other dealers but they weren't supposed to roll us. That was never the plan. I had to make ends meet Vince. You've been hurting. - Fuck, Bobby. - You know where they are now? - I don't know, man. Armenia, Paris, Italy. I don't know. They got their money and they left. That was their plan. - The girl at your house, she said you got a call. Did you know before me? - You went to my house? A buddy of mine got screwed, too. He calls me. I have to go see him. I can't see him and see you. - So you fucking let me discover by myself?! - I didn't mean for this shit. I didn't mean for this shit to happen, Vince I swear! - By the way, your other boss is looking for you, too. You saw him? - Yeah, I saw him. I couldn't get in touch with you. - Why would you do that? What did you tell him? - I told him we got screwed. Asked to cut us a deal, but that ain't happening. Instead, he tells me I deliver you he'll cut me a deal. - Vince, no. He wants to kill me, man. I screwed up, Vince. - Okay. Look, look, look, look. Hey! - I never fucking found you. Nobody's here. Nobody's going to know. - He's gonna know. He's gonna know, man. I don't know how he just has his ways. Look, he's a crazy motherfucker. He will kill both of us. You know, what? It's not your fault. I'll go meet him. I'll talk to him, it'll be fine. - Hey. Look, we got to stick together. You're too fucking young, kid. We stick together in this, Bobby. - I know. - You've always been like a brother to me, Vince. But you got to trust that I can handle this. I'll talk to him. It's gonna be fine. - Bobby. - It's positive. - Sorry. Yeah. May I grab this? - Okay. - Get in, Vince. - So? how's it going? - It's going. - It's a beautiful day out. - So hey, it's nice out everyday. Some people that suck. - Oh, that's not very nice, Vince. Have you seen Bobby lately? - No. - What are we doing here? - We're gonna need your cellphone. - Give me the fucking phone. - Why? - How about shut your yapper and give me the fucking phone? - I get this feeling I'm going for a long walk off a short pier. - I want to show you one of my new favorite spots. - We had a telling you the last time we met, Vince. - We're going to pay you. - I know you won't. - Get over there. Get on your fucking knees. Go down there. You heard what the fuck I said. - Come on, guys. We've got 4 more days, okay? Don't fucking hurt him. He's just a kid. We got some money, okay? - I don't like being lied to, Vince. - Just give us a couple more days and we will get you your money, please. Come on, come on. No! - It's my turn, hand me the fucking knife. - Fuck! No, no! Don't do it! - Street cred, Vince. - No! - Put him down and push him in the water. Let's go. You have four days, Vince. - 911, what's your emergency? - Yeah. - Ticket, sir? - What's wrong? - Glad you called me. Look, she can stay with me as long as you need. Alright, I got the extra bed in the hangar, it's no problem. - Thanks. - Can't even begin to imagine what you're going through. - I'm so screwed I don't know what to do. - You find the money. Guys like this are twisted and they're not normal. - They're going to come after me no matter what. They want the money and the license. - You don't know that. - I signed a contract. I pay them, they kill me. They have them both. You haven't been to something like this before? - Not to this extent, but something like it. - Whoa, what'd you do? - I hired someone. - Who? - Buddy Houston. - You still got his info? - But you got to contact someone who contact someone to contact this guy. Look Vince, maybe you can find the money. Just focus on that. - I've been trying. It's impossible, man. - It's too much money to raise. This fucking guy, he doesn't have an army. He has a few hired men around him. That's it. Go in there and take them all out. No retaliation, no trace or nothing. - Ah, fuck. I don't know what I'm thinking. - You're thinking ahead. That's good. I mean, come on. You know, we're not accountants. Sometimes we have to do things, other people don't have to. - Yeah. Thanks. - I always got your back. - Alright. - I'll be back. - Are we safe? - Yeah, they don't know about Connor. Or where he lives, so we're good. - Why can't we just go to the police then? - We can't. I'm in too deep and besides these guys, they're crazy. They'll come after me and everything I love. - I'm scared, Vince. - I know. I'm sorry for putting you through this. - This isn't how we're supposed to live. - I'll fix this, I promise. - You have to. - Yeah, I'd like to withdraw my money and close my account. Thank you. - I feel bad. I wish I could have given you the entire loan, but my money's tied up in this place. - It's all good. I just feel a fucking idiot to be leaving that fucking truck here. - How much you raised so far? - Not enough. - Not enough. Well, I want to give you 5k. - No, no, no, Frank. I'm not here to get money. - I got the money all ready for you. - I can't take your money, brother. - Good. Take the money. We'll figure it out. - Thanks brother. - No worries. - Hey Franco. - Sorry to ask for another favor, brother, but I really came by to see if I could get one of your guns. - Come on, man. You don't go mess with no guns. - I don't want to, but I mean, after what happened to Bobby, I just gotta protect myself. You still got them? - I mean, yeah, I still got them. I just can't give you my guns, they're registered to me. Something happens, I'm fucked. Sure someone in your line of work knows someone who has one? Maybe go there. - Yeah, yeah. Maybe. - How you doing, baby? - I'd like to be home but I'm holding up. - I know. I'm sorry. Look at you doing great. - I've been thinking. I don't know if your lifestyle is suited to raising a family. - What do you mean? - Maybe it is. But just not mine. I'm putting an option out there, okay? If you're looking for an out, I'm giving you one. - You don't mean that. - I just wish you were here. - Me too. Hey, I'll see you soon. - Hey. - Hey. - Can I help you? - Yes, ah... - Is Ruth around? - Who are you? - Vince. - Yeah. She's out back. - Ah, good. - So, how long have you been here? - Plus six months. We don't get many visitors. Ruth. [horse neighing - I was wondering when I'd see you. - It's been a while. - Staying for dinner? - Huh, I don't know. Maybe. - So where you coming in from? - LA. - What's in LA? - Ah, my work and my girlfriend. - Why didn't she come with you? - She's staying with a friend. - Same one from a few years ago? - Yeah, Tabatha. - I liked her. She was very sweet. You talking about moving in together? - Yeah, we did. - Oh. - I'm gonna come back out to the stables. - Okay, honey. Clara joined us about six months ago from Minnesota. There's another one in the back house, but he's just passing through. She's been real helpful. Getting the barn things cleaned up around here. - How're the horses, Ma? - Most of them died from the drought. - Sorry. - It's fine. You didn't know. - I tried calling. - I know. Something's wrong? - Everything's wrong right now. - I know. I knew before you said hi. Is it money you need? - No. Yeah, but that's not why I came. - Why did you come? - Just gonna grab your stuff. - Stuff? What's, what stuff? - It's just some stuff, Ma. - There you go. It's the same shit your father used to pull. - Don't compare me to him. - I don't know what kind of trouble you're in, but walk away. - I can't. - This is about that dope you deal, isn't it? I know your father didn't give you kids any direction and I blame him for your brother. - Ma, don't bring him up. - It's true! Don't be like him! Look how he wound up. Know when to say enough is enough. - So nice out here, huh? - Yeah. - You mind? - Where are you going with it? - Inside. - Over here's fine. - Huh. - Um, have a seat if you want. I am gonna go get changed. - Hey, have you seen a rifle around? - Ah, the Bold action? - Yeah, that's the one. - Yeah. Um, we use it to kill the coyotes. - You guys still need it? - Ah, no. I can get it for you. - That'd be great. Thanks. - Sorry. It's so dusty out there. You smoke? - No. - Did you find that a little ironic? - My mom told you what I do? - Yep. I hope you don't mind if I do. - No, that's fine. - You don't know what you're missing. Wanna hear some music? - No, I actually, you know what? That rifle would be great. - We'll get there. - So you know where the rifle is? - Is this what you're looking for? - I see the way you look at me. - How do I look at you? - You know how. No one's gonna know. - Next time, stay longer. - It's awfully friendly around here. - Listen, I'm sorry. I just get a little emotional. I love you. - I love you too, Ma. - Here you go. - No, no. - It's just a couple of thousand. It'll help you. - I'm good. - Just take it. - Please. I'm okay. Promise. - I want you to have some peace. You don't always have to be chasing something. You can settle down. I want some grandkids! - I love you, Ma. - Are you okay? - As best I can be. - I'm sorry. Is Scott around? - He's in the hangar. - Come on. - Talk to the guy. He give me tonight. Sure you want to do this? - Absolutely. - Is that him? - Yeah, that's him. - Thanks for coming. - Sure thing. - Here's the pictures and informational. - Great. Any home security I should know about? Guards? Dogs? - There's only a couple of guys. One large, tatted up guy. I didn't see any dogs. I imagine there's cameras but I can't say for certain. - That's fine. I don't take Bitcoin. Cash only. 25,000. 10,000 for anyone else I have to takeout. - Yeah. - That's good. - Half upfront. Good. I'd be in touch with you guys. - What if we need to get in touch with you? You know? So how do we know where you are? - Only my protégé knows. GPS. And I'll call you guys once the day in check in. - Wow. Fuck. - Who are you working with?! - Hard to refresh some guy, I don't know. - Give us the name or this is gonna last all day. - I don't know, just fucking some guy. - Old man, who are you working with? - Alright, it's Scott. You know this Carter? - Who's Carter? - How do I fucking know? - That answers your question? - Let me go! Let me go! - This is gonna hurt. - No! - Better get your ass moving if you wanna see your girlfriend alive, Vince. - Nice job, Fredo. What the fuck? You missed a spot, man. Cover it up. You know how hard it is to clean that up? - What the fuck. - Where the fuck's my girl? - I'm ready. - Good. - You fucking assholes! Where is she? - She's fine. The boss want to have some fun with her first. - Look, you got what you wanted. Just let her go. - You tried to kill our boss. You tried to steal our money. Look at where you're at. Look around. - The problem with the world today, is people like you think you're owned something. You're not owning anything. You're about to choke to death on your own blood at the hands of this artist. I'm really sorry you didn't get to watch his master work with your friend, Bobby. - Fucking assholes! - It's time to go. - Hey, look. You got what you want. Just let her go. - What the fuck? - Don't fucking move. -Who the fuck are you? - Who's that over there? - Somebody that got in the way. - Did you hire my father? - Yeah. - How much did it cost? - It's 25 grand. 10,000 for anyone else that gets in the way. Jesus. How the hell did you find us? - He keeps a tracker in his belt. Doesn't give me all the details, but may I see how is that? - Fuck. - What are you doing? - Checking their phones. Check the GPS history. See if I can find my girlfriend. God damn it. - There's somebody else responsible? - Yeah, these guys have a boss. What about your dad's tracker? - No, it's just a tracking device. It doesn't have a history. - Fuck. - Try to call her. - I'm sorry. - He knew the game. We all do. Hey. Are you gonna kill him? - I don't know. - Well, if you do, consider us even. boot thumps] - Oh, babe. - Babe. - I'm so sorry. Let me unite you up. - Babe! - Ah! - Funny enough, I think today was your deadline. - It's in our agreement page. - Babe! - Ah. - Are you okay? - I made a mistake. Should I hide you as my Hitman? I love you. Now get me to a hospital. - Oh. In the end, I probably should have just gone out of business. It would have been way easier that way. But it is what it is. The business completely changed. As legalization picked up, no longer did anyone need the dealer, nor are deliveries. running the show. Everyone wanted in on the action. You want a delivery? There's an app for that. You have a problem with the supplier? Call your lawyer. You want to own a part of a cannabis company? There's an overpriced stock on Wall Street. I was squeezed out of business I was on the forefront of. And even worse, no one ever known. Nor paid me for it. But I was never owed anything. Maybe I should have been. When I was breaking the law. I have a family with Tabitha now, and I went back to doing what I do best. Growing. Even better. I was working in what got deemed an essential business. Job security, go figure. I'm making enough money that I paid for Bobby's sister's college education. I know he would have appreciated that. Cannabis, flower, hemp, marijuana, whatever you want to call it, it became the highest revenue-generating agricultural crop in California. And I know how to grow it. I went full circle. That's my story.
