If everything could only start at the beginning again, then I can stop what I've already done. It's terrible to be hated the way people hate me. My life seems like that nightmare which always haunted me. Sabra? Are you all right? That scream you let out sounded like you were being murdered. It's all right, it's all over now. It's all over. Here. This will help. Huh? Every time, every time I take a nap, that same dream. Nobody's trying to hurt you. Stop that. Keep your hands off me. Don't you have something to do? Anything? I only wanted to make you feel better. Why, Ellie? What do you want? Don't tell me you care about me, and you don't want anything. I haven't seen it yet. Look at you. Look at yourself. Look at your hair. What's the matter with it? It's dirty. Oh, stop feeling sorry for yourself. I'll admit I'm not as pretty as you are, but I do try to take care of myself. That is not the point. I just wished you'd do something more and stop crawling all over me. Here, pledge. Want to do something, wash these. And don't come back until your hair is clean. Ellie irritated me, she was stupid. She did anything I told her to. I despised her for it. Hi. Oh, hello. I thought you were going into town this afternoon. I am. You're about the most secretive person I've ever known. What do you mean? That little case of yours, you never leave it open for more than 10 seconds. Always locking it up tight, like an old miser would a safe. Does that bother you? Yes, it does. What's so important that you have to hide so carefully. Makes me feel as if I'm rooming with an enemy agent. It's just some personal things, that's all. It's really none of your business. Okay. Rita, oh Andy's going to give me another tennis lesson. Do you want to join us? I'd love to, Terry, but I can't. Mort wants to discuss my campaign. Politics. Okay then, but next week for sure, after you're elected. If, you mean. But you know the student body can't do without you. It was always the same, everyone else kept together, leaving me alone, even though I had a shiny new car to drive. I would've traded places with any one of them. Goodbye, girls. Have a nice time. Hi, Rita. Can I give you a lift into town? No thanks, I feel like walking. Okay, suit yourself. Which is all right up to a point. I knock on the door and this big blonde comes. Rita. Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please. Unaccustomed though I am to be of all introductions, sentimental testimonials, commercial sponsoring of local beauties, indiscriminate support of women's equality and what have you. I should like to take this opportunity to present to you distinguished members of Yonder Institute of Higher Eradication. Here here! - Not yet. - Oh. The next president of your student body, the new dispenser of political spoils, Miss Rita Joyce. Hooray. Thank you, discriminating voters. Hi, Tina. Missed you at the meeting this morning. I'm sorry, but I had to study for an exam. What happened with the blonde in the door, finish the story. Later, later you guys, got a VIP here. Gotta treat her right. What's wrong with Tina? Oh, miseries, comes from being a pledge. Stop, you know Chi Sigma pledges are treated right. Yeah, you got the speech? Right here. Let me take that outside and read it. You don't look like you're feeling very well, Tina. I'm not. What's wrong? I've got a headache. Gee, that's a shame. You take an aspirin? Yes. If you'd like, I'll take over for you the rest of the afternoon. No, thanks anyhow. Rita? I hope you feel better. Rita? What is it, Tina? Never mind. What did you think? Too serious. Too serious? Much. You know what college kids are interested in? As a group? Two things, beer and laughs. Why do you think this place is such a success? Certainly ain't my paintings. People are interested in a lot of things. Books, events, ideas. See what I mean, beer and laughs. That stuff you got in there about eliminating discrimination at the university level, democratizing the fraternity system, that's all very fine but who cares? I care. You do, don't you? Rita, the secret of life is not to become involved. Beer and laughs. Or maybe the braunschweiger sandwich too now and then, you know they are very good. The specialty of the house, they leave a lump right here all night. I thought you were going to help me. I will. But the speeches you have, baby, now if you want to keep it serious, okay. I'll merely verse you in the practical politics of stuffing the ballot box. Remind me to tell you some time how I won the election. That was in my youth, of course, good old days of Scott University. Gentlemen, a toast. Beer and laughs. Beer and laughs. Terry, that's just beautiful. Where'd you get that pattern? Oh, at McCall? Well, it was three dollars a yard, that's pretty expensive. Yeah, but just think if you bought it ready-made, how much it would've cost. I said the material was expensive. It's all right. You look at this, cost 85 dollars. Now, if I could handle a needle, I'd tear it. The only difference is the styling. Yours is much more sophisticated. Well, that's only a matter of taste. All right, girls, dinner. Oh, Sabra. Your mother's here to visit you. She is? Yes, and she wants to have dinner with you. I promised I'd have you phone her as soon as you returned. She's at the hotel. Thank you, Mrs. Fessenden. Sabra? How does it look on me? Oh it looks fine, but you. How could Ellie ever look good in a dress like that? Someone had to tell her the truth. It's time we drop the charade. What do you mean? You didn't come down here to see me. Well certainly I did. Sabra, what do I have to do to convince you that I care about you? A lot more than you have. I know I haven't been perfect, but I am your mother. I know how to spell it, but what does it mean? It means that there's a very close bond between us. Since your father died, I've felt the responsibility more than ever. Now there's just you and me, we've got to hang on tightly to each other. And to the estate? That too, of course. Most of which will be mine. Why don't you say what you mean, Sabra? More pepper? Yes. You flew down here just to see me? There's something wrong with that? Should I apologize? I rather hoped you'd be glad. Mother, you wouldn't walk two blocks to see me. Maybe you mean that you wouldn't walk two blocks to see me. Now we're both speaking the truth. You're a brat the day you were born, it was in your eyes. Heredity, your genes I guess. Don't kid yourself. The only thing you've inherited is money. Dad's contribution. Except it's not yours yet. For a while, at least, I still control the purse strings. Why did you fly down, mother? I brought your allowance check. I saw no purpose whatever in mailing it. I hope you have enough clothes, dear, because that's what lifestyle tend to right. For now on, you can do without. I hate you. What a pity when I love you so much. Oh well. Someday, mother, someday. Are you leaving, dear? Do you want me to stay? What a fool mother was to think she can punish me. I didn't get money from her, I'd still get it somewhere. Who is it? It's me, Ellie. Come on in. Well? I've got your clothes. Okay. They're all pressed. Thanks. Would you hang them in the closet? The skirt was easy, but the dress took a while. I had to be very careful. Ellie, leave me alone. Hey? Come on, stay a while. Thanks, I will. I've been going crazy in my room. Yeah? It's Tina. She's been crying and moping around all day. What's her problem? I don't know, maybe she's in love with Mort. How's your love life, Ellie? Well, yesterday in the cafeteria... Ellie, you know there's really. Did you do your exercises this morning? I was going to but. Oh Ellie, you're impossible, impossible! I thought you wanted to do something with yourself. Look at you. Well? Well don't you? You know, if you don't help yourself, I'll just have to do it for you, that's all. Here, you can wash these. Besides, it's good for your figure. I've got an exam tomorrow. You're not refusing, are you? No, but... You want to go active? One vote from me and you're out. Fine. I'll wash them. That's better. Hi, Ellie. Hello, Terry. Hey, expensive-looking stockings. They're not mine, they're Sabra's. They're Sabra's? Yes. And you're washing them? Yes, but. You know the regulations, Ellie. Pledges aren't supposed to do personal tasks for actives. I offered to, it wasn't Sabra's fault. I wish I could believe you, but I know Sabra. She's done this before. Hand me these. Are these your stockings? You're supposed to knock. I caught Ellie washing them. So? You know very well you're not supposed to make the pledges wash your personal things. I didn't make her. You're a liar. That's not very nice. Terry, don't you have something better to do than to make a federal case out of every little thing? Don't slam the door too hard. Sabra? From now on, don't talk so much. I just can't get the baby. I can't have a baby. I can't have a baby. I can't. Sabra? What's up? I've got something to tell you, but it's a secret. What is it? Promise not to tell anybody? Well. You remember last night when I told you about how Tina was crying and moping around? So? She's in real trouble. She's pregnant. How do you know? I heard her say so. When? Last night in her sleep, she was crying and mumbling and I heard her. - Are you sure of this? - Positive. She say anything else? No, I listened very hard, and she didn't mention any names or anything. You know, if the other girls find out about this, it'll be a real scandal. Listen, let's get one thing straight. This is a secret, huh? And it's going to remain a secret. Nobody else is going to find out. But... At least not from you or me. Sure, only if she's going to have a baby. It seems I heard something once about sorority sisters and loyalty. You and I are going to help Tina by keeping this a secret, understand? Yes, Sabra. You didn't even tell me about this. All right. Okay. Did you do your exercises this morning? My stomach still hurts from the last time. We'll have a little session in my room tonight, when the others are at the rally. Be there at eight. You hear me, pledge? Yes, Sabra. Eight o'clock, okay? I'd better be getting back, don't wanna be gone too long. How about tomorrow night? Huh, I know, the election rally and you're the first speaker. There'll still be time to catch a show or something. I've got to study some time, Mort. I haven't cracked a book all week with all this election business. Honest, after this week, no excuses, I promise. Promises, promises, promises. You idiot. I'll see you after psych. Hiya, Mort, sorry I'm late. That's okay. What about those signs you said you'd have by tonight? All right, all right, Professor LaGrie, I've been working as fast as I can. Hey look, I've only got two arms, and a half a tooth. Well, if you don't have Rita's campaign signs by tonight, you'll only have half a head. You know it might be an improvement? Never mind. Hey Mort, what's with you and Rita? You're gonna get married maybe? You know me, love 'em and leave 'em. Sure, and then you wrote. Seriously, what's up? How would I look married to a politician? Huh? Hi, Sabra. Hi, Sabra. You know, I'd like to take her out some time. What for? - I don't know. - Come on, jughead. You know, Rita and Mort have been going together for about a year now. They're so cute together. I wonder if they'll get married. Ellie had given me an idea, it'd be fun to take Mort away from Rita. I really wanted to. I wish her lots of luck. Come on, we'll be late for class. Hey now, remember to all spread out, so that when we cheer for her, we won't sound like a clan. Who is it? It's me, Ellie. Come on in. Hello. Hi, feeling limber tonight? My stomach hurts. Well, don't worry about it. How many do I have to do? Let's see, 25. 25? 25. Come on. One, two, three. Ah, ah, ah, let's not stop now. It's only three, got 22 more to go. I can't. Sure you can, come on now, no resting. Ellie, I'll be back in a few minutes. But don't stop. Hi. - Hi. Don't tell me I have a fellow compatriot. Just what is all that fancy dialogue mean? Who are we kidding? Well, I thought the rally was the big thing tonight. How come you're not there? Well, I'm going over just as soon I pick up Rita. Is she ready yet? She left a little while ago. Oh. Was she mad? I told her I'd be here a half hour ago. I got hung up at the bar. Do you usually get hung up at bars? Or do you just like a game of cat and mouse, or hide and seek? Or, tag? A little of each, I never miss an angle. Well, I guess I'll be getting over to the rally. Well, you're already late. I mean, would it hurt if you were a little later? I guess not. Most of the damage has been done already. Why, what's up? Oh, I, just wanted to talk. I wanted to talk to you. Sure. Okay, what can I do for you? Your hand feels so warm on my back. More like. Mort? Don't go. No one could ignore me the way Mort did. I swore I'd get even with him from that moment on. What are you doing? How come you've stopped? Because I couldn't do any more. If it's going to do any good at all, you've got to keep it up. I can't. I'm not going to. If you give up so easily all the time, and keep feeling sorry for yourself, you know where you'll end up? Nowhere. It's for your own good, Ellie. All right. All right. No. Come on. Please, Sabra. You don't really want to do anything with yourself. You wanted me to help you, but you're not trying hard enough. Okay, discipline. My stomach. I do them and they don't hurt my stomach. I know but they're harder for me. They used to be hard for me too. Teach you not to be so soft with yourself. Maybe now, you won't say can't. What a horrible thing to do. Are you all right? You'd better go to your room now. You don't belong on this campus. I knew you'd hang yourself with something sooner or later but I didn't think it would be with anything like that. I haven't done anything so terrible. The Dean will take care of you. She'll have you out on your rear so fast, you won't know what you hit you. All I did was spank her a little. That was some spanking. She's a pledge, she had to be disciplined. We'll let the Dean decide that. Maybe she'll agree with you. Maybe she won't. I never meant to really hurt her. I suppose that's why you used this, huh? Rita, I didn't mean to do it. I don't believe you. Please, don't go to the Dean. I'll try, I'll do anything. No, you said that before. So, your father's been in prison, huh? Seems as though he killed quite a few people. He didn't kill anybody. Some buildings he owned collapsed. Buildings? You mean tenements, don't you? Whatever the reasons are, people died. Died, because of your father's negligence, hmm? Look at you, preaching the right and wrong of everything. Suppose you never make a mistake, huh? Aren't you wearing your halo a little too tight? I'm doing. Never mind, you wouldn't understand. Nah-uh, but I'll tell you what I do understand. I understand you're not going to the Dean tonight. Not the Dean or anybody else. Do you understand? All right, Rita. Because if you go to the Dean, I'll spread this all over the place, and your election campaign will go right down the drain, the sorority and maybe even you. I can't lose everything because of you. I can't lose everything because you, either. I hope we understand each other now. Oh, all right. Yes, but it smells. I want those. Ah, ah, ah, ah, I'll hang onto them for a while. Something kept driving me to go on hurting others. I knew I was sick, I needed someone to help me. Even if it was mother. Thanks a lot, I'll see you, bye. Sabra, what on Earth are you doing home? I drove up from school. Yes, I can guess that, but why? Spur of the moment. Have you been expelled? No. So what are you doing here? I had to I've wanted. Oh for heaven's sake say it, don't just sit there sputtering, you sound like your father. Mother, I need you. You drove a hundred miles to tell me that? I need you. All right, you need me. Such a child. Those things at the restaurant, I didn't mean the things. Oh? I don't know what got into me, I wanted to hurt you. Obviously. Why do I do things like that? There must be something wrong with me. Nonsense. I want to hurt everybody. What's wrong with me? Nothing is wrong with you. There shouldn't be, after all you've always had the best money could buy. And it's time you started demonstrating that fact, it's just a question of making up your mind. Mother. Now, don't do that. It's just your love, it's all I want. You have my love, now stop acting like an infant. If you don't help, I don't know. What kind of help is it you're after? Is it money, you want your allowance back? Is that what you want? No. I am not ready to restore it. Please listen to me! Now really, Sabra, you are much too old for this kind of scene-making. In plain everyday language, Sabra, what is it you're after? What is it you want? That doesn't matter. If you start now, you can get back before dark unless you want to stay for dinner. No, I have some work to do, I'll go back. Well, I've got to run, I promised Anne Tyson I'd have cocktails with her. How foolish I've been to think that mother could understand. She never cared enough to understand. Tina? - Hi. - Hi. Can I give you a lift? - Oh, that'd be swell. - Good. Looked like you need one. What are you stopping here for? I wanted to talk to you. What about? I know you're upset about something. I wish you'd tell me what's wrong. I don't know what you mean. There's nothing wrong. Let me put it another way. I know you're desperate about something. What makes you think I am. Tina, I know. Know what? You're gonna have the baby, aren't you? You're crazy. Tina, Tina? Tina? Tina, stop. Tina, please. Tina? Tina? I know you are. It's not true. You know it's true. Maybe I can help you, maybe we can help each other. How did you find out about this? It doesn't matter. Don't worry, no one knows. Where is he? He left town, I don't know where he is. I just don't know what to do. Well, whatever you're going to do, you need money. I mean, just going off private somewhere to have a baby, well you need money, am I right? Yes, I know. All right, you need money. I'm in a bit of a jam myself. I need money too. - You? - Yes. Tina, what about Mort? What about him? If you can say, well if you can say he's the one. I know it's crazy, but Mort has a name and reputation he can't afford to lose. What's more, I hear he has plenty in the bank. I couldn't do a thing like that to Mort. If you can just write him a letter. That's blackmail. I won't do it, it's not right. I know it's not right, but meanwhile that'll help pay enough for both of us. We can straighten it out later. I can't think of anything else. If you can think of a better answer, I'd be glad to listen. This whole thing's ridiculous. I'm gonna report you to the Dean. Okay. If that's the way you want it. I don't wanna hurt you, but if I have to, I will. Either a letter goes to Mort, or I'll be happy to go to the Dean with you, and everyone will know. You wouldn't. Just think about it. Time's getting shorter for both of us. Hey, this is Mort's place. Where the beer is cold and the crew and is cool, and I'm testing, one, two, three, four. And on the customer's side, one, two, three, four. Hey, this is Mort's place, where the beer is cold and the crew is cool. Oh hi. He just called. He wants to see me right away. Listen, just remember, choose your words carefully, that's all, in case he has a witness listening in. What are standing there for? Be right with you. Come on in. Take a seat. I didn't open any of my mail until tonight. This one took the wind right out of me. That's yours, right? Yes, it's mine. And this isn't somebody's crazy idea of a gag? No, I meant every word of it. When did you find out you were pregnant? A few days ago, that's when I found out for sure. You went to a doctor? Of course I did. And what do you intend to do? Go wait somewhere until your time is up? I don't know yet. But you do know you need money. Yes. Why me, Tina? I mean, haven't I always treated you right? Of course you have. I pay you enough? Yes. I don't work you too hard? No. And you know I'm not the father. You are the father. Come on now, Tina, I never touched you. You're the one that made me pregnant. Look Tina, let's not play games, huh? If you'll level with me, I'll try and help you. Oh, I get it. You think maybe I got somebody stashed here. A witness, huh, is that it? Well go ahead, look around. Take a look in the back too. Well, satisfied? Yes. All right, then, I'm not the father, am I? No, but I'll say you are. And they'll believe me. Who's they? The Dean and the trustees. Oh, so that's it. They'll close this place up so fast. Yeah, yeah I guess they would at that. Look, I want the money by tomorrow night, otherwise I go to the Dean. That's blackmail, Tina. You just admitted I'm not the father. I know you're not, but you've got a thousand to spare. And I want it by tomorrow night, clear? Yes Tina, that's clear. Wonderfully clear. In fact, everything you've said in the last five minutes is clear. And it's all here on this tape. It goes in a safe right now. So you don't need the money now, what you need is a good safe cracker. Now, I'm not gonna say anything about this, but you see to it that you stay out of my way, understand? Now get out of here and get out fast, because you stink. You and your whole lousy scheme. A little help please, huh? Ellie dear, could I speak with you a moment? Yes, ma'am. Thanks, nice throw. Come dear, sit down. What's bothering Tina? I don't know. I've tried talking with her, but she won't open up. I'm worried about her, she's been brooding like this for days. That's not good. If you know what the trouble is, Ellie, and you're keeping quiet about it, you're doing Tina a disservice. I don't know. That child has a problem. Keeping it locked up inside her isn't helping. All right, Ellie, you can join the others now. Thank you, Mrs. Fessenden. What did she want? She wanted to know about Tina. Know what about Tina? What was bothering her. What'd you tell her? That I didn't have any idea. You know, I do those pretty well now. Won't be long, I'm getting thinner. You're doing fine. I'm trying, anyway I'm getting tougher. Sabra? What? Do you think we're doing Tina a disservice by keeping quiet about her? Nobody asked you to think. Never mind, just keep on with the good work. I am. Don't let it go to your head. Hi. Hi. Still in the dumps? Look, don't you think maybe it would be better if you told somebody what was bothering you? Can't be as bad as all that. Maybe Mrs. Fessenden can help. Or your parents, that's what they're there for. Ellie, will you please leave me alone? Okay, okay I was just trying to help. Catch it! Oh, you're terrible! Hey Tina, aren't you going to put your suit on? You'll never get a suntan that way. Let's get a Coke. You're gonna have to give some kind of explanation soon. It's hopeless. My whole life's messed up. That makes both of us. Time sure is running out. Tina! Tina! She's gonna jump! Easy, Tina. Easy there, it's gonna be all right. She made me do it, I didn't really want to. She made me. It's gonna be all right. Everything is gonna be all right, just take it easy. It's gonna all right, it's gonna be all right. She made me do it. What does she mean, Mort? She's pregnant. I called her mom and dad this morning, they're coming up to take care of her. She was trying to blackmail me. Somebody else must've put her up to it though. Sabra, it was her idea, it was Sabra. It's gonna be all right, Tina. It's gonna be all right, honey. You're not human, you're something the sea cast out. Just stay away, all of you. You're like the sharks out there. You don't have any rules, just self-preservation. I suppose everything you do is right! You blackmailed Tina and almost killed her. I didn't see any of you tried to help her! You even tried to blackmail me. Don't think I don't know what you were trying to do. I know you were trying to get rid of me. And you beat Ellie. How you can twist everything. Ever since the first day I came, you and your little clique, no outsiders allowed. So what happens? Everyone ends up hating everyone else. So I had all the breaks, money, a good family. You never bothered to find out what my story was. It doesn't matter anymore. I don't need you. I don't need anybody. Leave her. If everything could only begin for me once more, it's too late for me, I've lived my life. Always afraid, every moment of it.
