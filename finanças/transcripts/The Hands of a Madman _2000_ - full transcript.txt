(intense music) (somber music) (radio interference) (talk radio plays) - [Radio Host] And then once home from school, no teacher's gonna look for it. How are you gonna expect a six-year-old to have it? If there was a plane crashing into the school, that's terrifying at 37, a messy thing to say. Somebody needs to be responsible for that. The captain thought that the plane was falling down somewhere and had to land somewhere, it should aim to get down inside a bullet. (vacuum suction) - [Radio Co-Host] I would be even more concerned. But just having a gun around there and as the kid said, "This is like what I see on TV." What do you do with something like that? Maybe this kid literally thought this is what he sees people do that get frustrated on TV. (pump whirring) (intense music) - Bobbie, if you'd please hurry up and inject that anti viral vaccine, it would be much appreciated. (pump whirring) - [Bobbie] Okay. (crashing) (intense music) - All our research. Our work is loose! If he makes it into the city, we're ruined! How did he get out? - He jumped up and, I don't know how he did it, but, we have to find him. We have to get him before. - Before he screws everything up! His mind's been arranged. Imagine him awakening for the first time. Imagine the rage he'll create just to survive. Oh, Bobbie, my pistol on top of the liquor cabinet. Bobbie, get it now! Hurry! God. (phone ringing) (cameras clicking) - So, Mr. Calhoun, would you mind? - Callaghan. - [Stephen] Excuse me? - Charlie Callahan, not Calhoun. You said Calhoun. - I apologize Charlie. You'll have to forgive me, I'm not the best person in the world with names. Now, if you could, Mr. Callahan, please repeat your statement, this time for the record. - I was taking the dirt road home from my brother's condo in Pine Top. ♪ Would you like to know ♪ ♪ When I think of you ♪ ♪ I just smile, just waiting ♪ (intense music) - So Charlie, it's safe to say that you can't identify either the make or the model of the vehicle you saw? - Yes. It was like something right out of a movie. Scary as can be. - Well, that'll be all, Mr. Callahan. Thank you very much. (phone ringing) - Well, anything? - Not much, same news, no make or model. Just some guy drove down the road right past the killer and didn't see his face. - Either that or he's lying. - No, if he was after attention, he'd have gone straight to the press. - Whatever boys, document this guy's report and move on. If there's a killer in Pine Top, we'll give their department everything we've got. You two shouldn't be working with cases that are outside of your jurisdiction anyway. However, if there was a killer in Phoenix, well now, then you guys can go ahead and worry. (soft music) (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Melissa] Hmm, who is it? - [CTerrin] You better get down here. It's happened again. - What is it hun? - [Stephen] Where are you? - [Terrin] 13th and Washington. - All right. I gotta go. There's been another murder. - Again? - There's been another murder. - You know, it would be nice if you can sleep in every once in a while. Don't you think? - I'll try and get home early. - There he is, let's go. - Okay, there you go. - Detective isn't that three murders now? - No comment. - Could you make a statement for the press? - No comment. - I guess Detective doesn't have a comment for us at this time. - [Stephen] What do we got? - Okay, thanks, oaky. Housewife, mid 30s probably. Seems our killer has a thing for plastic bags. Again, we see him induce pain to his victims, minor cuts, bruises. Still, though, the cause of death remains to be suffocation. - [Stephen] Hair follicles, blood, anything? - Well, we're still looking but so far it's the same story. Nada. - How? It's like we're chasing some kind of a ghost. - It gets better. This makes the third victim now. All of them with the same suffocation style. All of them, no detectable MO. - Four, if we count that girl in Tucson. - That's right, but she was strangled, not suffocated. - She had cuts and abrasions. - It's all yours Detective Kremsin. I wish I had more for you guys but I don't. It's the only evidence we have, shoved halfway down the victims throat, planted. (intense music) - Thanks, we just want to take a quick look around. (intense music) - Jesus. (intense music) - Did she have any relative? - Still checking. (intense music) - Well, she woke up before she died. Look, she grabbed the blade in self defense. - Which means that he was either loud enough for her to hear or. - Or he wanted her to wake up. He wanted to watch her die, which indicates. - Total lunatic. - Our very first. - Nice. Well, everyone's gotta start somewhere I guess. - I just hope our inexperience doesn't get us taken off this case. Let's go. (intense music) (upbeat music) - [Terrin] So what do you know about serial killers? - [Stephen] Enough to keep on top of this. What do you know? - [Terrin] More than they taught in the academy. You got a degree in psychology right? - Yeah. A minor, really. But I did my homework if that's what you mean. - It just appears that we have a history maker is all. - [Stephen] What do you mean? - You know. A skeleter-draining, Ramirez-breathing, Jamer-eating, Henry Lucas, old-fashioned, cityside meat packer on the loose. - Well, he's got a ways to go before he reaches those ranks, don't you think? Besides, that's not the point. The point is, we've got to stop this long before this guy gets a chance to be some kind of a dictionary picture of a serial killer. - Dictionary picture? It's only gonna take so much as five or six newspaper articles before we go down as the detective who put the department to shame. - It has been forever since I researched serial killers, since college. I'm gonna hit the books again, see whether or not we missed anything. I want you to check and see whether or not there's any similarities between the victims. - [Terrin] Like what? - Like the way they piss. I don't know, anything. We gotta start somewhere. - [Terrin] Sure. - See you Wednesday. Compare notes. - Okay. (intense music) (can popping) (keyboard clicking) (knocking) - What do you got for me kid? - [Detective] Files, nothing but files. - Nothing? You mean there's been four murders and you don't have nothing? Oh, I see. You're just getting started though, aren't you? Oh, what do we have over here? - It's called work Phelps. - Brushing up on a little homework I see. Isn't that nice? Well, I guess we don't wanna miss anything, do we? - That's enough Phelps. You couldn't have done any better without hard evidence. If I thought you could've, then you'd be working on this case. Now zip it up. - Give me just five minutes Sir. That's all it'll take, five minutes. - Five minutes to what? Beat up on Brian? Oh, that's cute. Did you hear that Brian? Sounded like a threat to me. - Are you threatening me Steve? - Yes. - Hey guys, break it up. - Taylor's not small enough for us, now is he? - That's enough. Listen, I want a full report on my desk by tomorrow morning at five. - Yes sir. Get out of my office. - Gladly. (intense music) - Overall, our study did, in fact, show that most serial killers intentionally leave clues behind. Reasons for such behavior include personal gratification and/or personal triumph. For a far more severe killer or psychopath, being caught can actually be considered beneficial. This act is considered stardom, which is created by variables such as mass media and looked upon as a kind of trophy. It is for this reason, clues may even be left behind by the killer's subconscious. (intense music) (intense music) - Honey? - Yeah. - Do you think you can come home a little early tonight for dinner? I could go ahead and pick up a couple steaks. - Sweetie, this is a chance to prove that you can handle a really big case and if we don't get something going real soon, they're gonna take us off of it. Sometimes the work, just, it takes all night. - What about developing our relationship Stephen? We've been together for two years. You finally have a steady job. What about taking that next step? What about marriage? Do you still love me Stephen? At least, I still hope you do at least. - Of course I do. It's just that I don't want to rush into anything. - Rush into anything? You call two years rushing? My sister married the guy that she knew for only six months. Forgive me if I'm just a little bit jealous. - That's your sister. Come on, one minute she's a new dancer. The next minute, she's a church-going flower child. - Well, at least she finally committed to something Stephen. {phone ringing) - I promise I will try and get home as quick as I can this evening, okay? - Duty calls. (phone ringing) - Yes? - [Terrin] We have another victim. - Where you at? - [Terrin] South Port Beach, right off the freeway. - All right, give me five, 10 minutes. I'll be there. - [Terrin] Try to get here before the press catches on. - Well, so much for breakfast, I guess. - Look. I'll be back tonight, I promise. - [Melissa] Actions speak louder than words Stephen. - Let 'em, I'll be here. (intense music) - [Woman] I hope you guys keep this crap out of papers. This is a family place, you know? - Look lady, I told you I don't personally publish this crap. Hell, I don't even talk to reporters, so just give us a break, okay? Well, look who finally decided to show up. - Oh well, let's just hope he's the only one. - What is it with you? (gravel crunching) - Sorry. - A little odd, bit unprofessional don't you think? Being late in a case like this and all. - It's Melissa. It's the marriage thing again. (intense music) What do we got here? - A young man, probably around 19, 20. - Killer was as smart as ever. He even went so far as to cover his tracks. Abrasions on the neck indicate, he's been dead, I don't know, five, six hours tops. (intense music) What are you looking for? - Another piece of the puzzle. It's just as I thought. He's leaving clues behind. I gotta go and do some research. Why don't you meet me later for lunch? - What about the body? - Terrin. - Yeah. - Get everybody here. We'll clean this up. - I was just telling your partner here that I don't need the press turning this family beach into a city morgue. - [Stephen] Relax. Terrin, call him on the phone and get me, don't use the police radio. All these freelancers got scanners. - [Terrin] Sure thing. Hey. - Well, I finished my research and I think I got something. You can call it a lead. - [Terrin] Really? About time. - Well, you remember the two pieces of paper that we found lodged in the throats of the first two victims? - Yeah. - [Stephen] One said producers and the other said decomposers. Well, I ran those two words through my web browser. - And? - Well, what I kept coming up with was this biological circle of life. - Biological circle of life? - In the chemistry of life, there's what biologists call producers, consumers, and decomposers. - English please. - Okay, well, producers would be like plants giving off oxygen and providing food. Consumers would be like people. Funny thing though, consumers are the only part of the equation that's optional. All we do is consume or take up, whereas decomposers like bacteria, they recycle. They're supposedly more useful from a biological standpoint. - Okay. What does this have to do with our killer? - Well, it seems that this diagram is used as a logo by some doctor, Roger Carl. He runs a genetic lab. And get this, the lab is located in Pine Top about five minutes from where Charlie Callahan saw somebody stuffing something into the trunk of a car. - Well, let's go. Let's go talk to this Carl guy. - No, wait a minute. It's like a two hour drive up there and hey, besides, I've already got plans for dinner. Some of us have a social life, you know. - Yeah, but two hours up, two back? You're gonna be home by six. Come on, man. Come on. - [Stephen] All right, we're home by six. - Right on. (door chiming) (whirring) (gravel crunching) (intense music) (doors closing) - Huh, doesn't seem like much of a laboratory to me. (intense music) (knocking) (knocking) - Can I help you? - Dr. Carl? - That would be me. What can I do for you? - Detective Stephen Kremsin, Phoenix PD, Homicide. - [Terrin] Can we come in Doctor? We have a few questions we'd like to ask you. - A few questions, huh? - [Stephen] Yes sir. - By all means, come in. Come in. Right down the hall. Right this way. But honestly, I'm not too surprised that you're here. In some ways, I've been expecting someone to show up. Please don't touch anything. It's all valuable. I said, "Don't touch anything." - Sorry, I'm curious. You do all of your work out of such a small building. It just seems rather awkward. - Believe me Detective. If I can afford a big shot laboratory, you think I'd be here? Easy son. This is Detective Kremsin and - Sizeman. - [Stephen] Won't be a minute Doctor. Actually, it's quite simple. - [Dr. Carl] Can we all be seated? Would you like a beverage or refreshment? I assume you will. - We'll be fine Doctor. This is an investigation. It's not a cocktail party. - I wouldn't mind a soda if you got one. It was a long drive. - Bobbie. - [Terrin] Bobbie. - [Bobbie] Yeah. - If you have any pretzels or cookies back there, that'd be great. - You certainly are assertive. - Dr. Carl, there have been five killings in a reasonable period of time, committed, we believe, by the same person. At the last two murder locations, I found a little bit of logo, the same logo under which your facility here operates. - Detectives, I wish not to jerk you around. I know why you're both here. You don't need to explain. I do indeed have information that could be of great value to you. However, I hope you can understand my situation and we can make a sort of deal. It would be for my protection, of course. - Dr. Carl, if you're withholding information from this investigation. - Please Detective. I'm a man of the MENSA intelligence and what I have done has gone beyond all scientific barriers. Now, if I went to the police with my story, two things would happen. Number one, my technology would be lost or should I say, stolen by some public lab or university who would take my work and patent it. It would take credit for what I've created and without credit, I could never move out of this mighty facility. - What in the hell are you talking about? - My technology Detective, G.E.C. 1. You're looking at a scientist who genetically engineered a perfect human being. Perfect eyesight, strength, and best of all, accuracy. - Doctor, that's ridiculous. - I've been more than hospitable to you. I would appreciate the extension of the same gratitude. - What are you talking about hospitality? This is a murder investigation. We did not drive down here from Pheonix to hear this cock and bull story. - All right. Unfortunately, he escaped. He took my car and vanished. And perhaps worst of all, is that while he may be physically perfect, his mind is so young. He escaped before his mentality was able to grow. In time, it'll develop and I'm certain by now, he's quite sharp. But can you imagine how scared he must feel? It doesn't take a genius to figure out what a frightened beast will do for survival. Try trapping a mountain lion in a dark corner. Pardon my cliche, you catch my drift? (laughing) - You honestly are gonna sit there and tell us that a man you created is responsible for the Pheonix murder streak? Come on Doc, what do you take us for? - [Bobbie] He's telling the truth. - How are we supposed to believe such a remarkable story? - That, gentlemen, is exactly what I'm trying to say. My second reason I elected not to turn him over. A geneticist such as myself would prefer not to be made a fool, not many geneticists would. - What proof do you have? - [Dr. Carl] Proof huh? - Please. - [Dr. Carl] Bobbie. - Yes Doctor. - This should be good. - Bobbie, show the detectives the pictures and tissue samples. Please don't ask me to show his complete genetic code. It goes up an entire filing cabinet. - Stephen, I've heard enough, let's get out of here. He'll come to us or we'll just explain. - [Stephen] Now, hold it a minute. Let's see the whole picture. This had better be good Doctor. - Yeah Terrin, hold on. Thanks Bobbie. - So, what does G.E.C. 1 stand for? - Oh, you didn't figure it out Detective? G.E.C. 1 is a genetically engineered consumer. Didn't the logos you find give it away? Producers, consumers, decomposers. - So why is G.E.C. 1 or G.E.C. 1 leaving little bits of your logo laying around? - I don't know. You're the detectives. Run all the tests that you like. I doubt you'll find it to be like anything tested before. - So if his intellect is so underdeveloped, why is he intelligent enough to frame you? - Well, like I said Detective, his witty intelligence could have evolved. That would explain why only your tumulus twin victims had significant clues leading to me. - So what is this, some kind of genetic blueprint or something? - Bravo Detective. You seem to be a little brighter than your friend here. - Now, you watch your mouth. - [Stephen] Chill out. - This is exactly why I created G.E.C. 1. Could you imagine a cop who's always patient and never makes lazy or frail mistakes? Such a vision is probably not too vettable to you now, is it Terrin? You can't truly appreciate the idea of perfection, can you? - You realize we can bring you in right now if we wanted to? - He's just trying to get to you. Don't let him. - Now, I've given you a tissue sample, complete with DNA and blood type. Even the release of those papers puts me at risk of being exposed. And you'll need every one of those papers if you're gonna prosecute. Now, I don't ask for much in return except you keep this information to yourself until you apprehend G.E.C. 1. - Are you honestly trying to get me to withhold information from the department? - Yes, if you consider my testimony in court to be of importance. I don't want my research leaking out on the five o'clock news. - Well, I can guarantee these papers won't go past my superiors. They won't get to the press. But that's all I'll promise Doctor. - Well, damn, that's not good enough. Don't tempt me. I'm giving this evidence in confidence you'll keep it to yourself or risk losing my testimony. Do you really expect a jury to believe this story without testimony from a licensed doctor of genetic biology, who in fact created G.E.C. 1 in the first place? I'd it possible? I don't think so. So if you put me on the witness stand, pal, I'll tell nothing but lies. Do you hear me? Nothing but lies. - All we're interested in, Doctor, is the killer. Your secrets, quite frankly, are of no importance. Good day. - Damn it. Hey, I don't get it Stephen. Let's storm this place right now, come on. We could take this asshole in right now. He's an accessory to murder for crying out loud. At the very least, he's lying to the authorizes. We have perjury. - We don't have enough yet. The way I see it, we stand a good chance of letting this guy get off. There's no way in the world that a jury's gonna convict this guy beyond a reasonable doubt. - [Terrin] Jesus. (soft music) (door closing) (soft music) - That isn't going to make up for dinner. - We got caught up north questioning some geneticist. I'm sorry. - A geneticist? Okay. Anyways, wish you would've been here. (upbeat music) (thunder clapping) (upbeat music) - Ah ladies. (upbeat music) (phone ringing) Hello? Hello? (intense music) There it is. Take the towel off. Take the towel off. (intense music) (doorbell ringing) (intense music) (thunder clapping) (phone ringing) Hello? (intense music) (alarm beeping) (intense music) (phone beeping) What's going on here?

How's Melissa? - [Stephen] What? - Your girlfriend. - It's not important. - All right. (laughing) Anyone happen to see him go to Pine Tops besides his brother? - We're still checking, but the brother's a dead end. - [Terrin] Why is that? - Well, it seems that he was even richer than Charlie. My guess is is that he's on vacation or something. All I can get from his answering machine is that he's away and he won't be back until Christmas. - Oh, that's just great. This just keeps getting better and better, doesn't it? What about friends and neighbors? They had to see something. - No, but a North Scottsdale patrolman did say that he saw a guy walking out of the grocery store wearing a black trench coat. Now, Charlie said he saw a guy wearing a trench coat too. - [Terrin] Cop get any kind of ID? - No, he was busy handing out loitering tickets. - That just doesn't help us very much. What about if we just post the cop in every QuikiMart from here to Pine Top? Finally catch him sooner or later. (phone ringing) - Well, I did interview a clerk at the grocery store. - [Terrin] What did he buy? - Hello? I'm just finishing up here with Terrin. I don't wanna invite him. Okay, okay, okay. You had any dinner? - Me? You wanna invite me for dinner? Well, I guess there really is a first time for everything. - Okay, I will be home soon. - Well? - [Stephen] What? - Are you gonna tell me what he bought or you wanna discuss it over dinner? - A box of plastic baggies. Oh, get this, a package of fat cigars. - No kidding. Perhaps we ought to pay our good doctor another visit. - No, not yet. It's still not enough. What if he's telling us the truth? He did give us genetically altered human DNA. I had the guys at the lab check. - Did the clerk give any kind of description? - No, all he said was that it was a middle-aged white male, same as every other clown he's handed change to and ignored. The sketch artist couldn't do anything with it either. (phone ringing) I hope you're hungry. - Wow. No, don't worry about me. You're just hungry. - When she cooks for two, it's a feast. I don't even wanna thinking about what three's gonna be like. - Hey boys. Still working on that homicide? A solid lead would be nice any day now. I don't wanna get stuck picking up too much of your slack when the case gets handed over to us. - Yeah, that's funny Phelps. You still live with your mom these days? I hear she puts out really good for the guys upstairs. Can you believe this guy? (intense music) (tires screeching) (intense music) - Come on, let's go. It's him.

Hell man. What do you expect me to do? Oh shit. (coughing) (grunting) (intense music) (soft music) - You want some? You want some? Well, you know what? You can have some because obviously, Daddy's not gonna be here to have it, is he? - Well, how long did you guys struggle? - Just a few minutes. It wasn't much of a struggle. - If you two would've called for backup while you were in pursuit, we could've surrounded the place. - Yes sir, but everything happened so fast. - Sir, we can guarantee. - Guarantees are hard to keep Detective Sizeman. You guys have brought in all kinds of information on this case, enough so that we can convict Dr. Carl and I'll give you all the credit you deserve for that. You've got to understand the pressure I'm under here to get some experience on this case. - You call them experience? - [Kyle] I'm just doing what I think is the most even hand. - [Stephen] You can't take us off it now. - [Toy] Hey! - I've got a hunch. It's not so simple and I'm not gonna let anyone else die. I've seen this guy. We've met him. We've seen this bastard face to face. Don't you understand what that feels like? - It's already done. I signed the paperwork this morning. - Well, it's not gonna be my parents who are down here blaming you for the death of their son. Let's see how you feel when there's a knock on that office door and it's the parents of Dr. Carl's next victim. Congratulations fellas. Can't wait to see how you screw this one up. - Well, apparently I'm not the one getting screwed here, now, am I Stephen? - [Stephen] Get out of here. (cars whirring) - What has gotten into you Stephen? All you care about is that damn case. What about me? - We've already been through all this Meiissa. You know that I love you. Everything's just real hectic right now and I almost got killed tonight. Doesn't that mean anything? - Yes Stephen, that does mean something and I love you. That's why all I want is a little ring on my finger to prove how committed our relationship is. I'm beginning to think that maybe you should just marry Dr. Carl because that seems to be who you devote all of your time to. - You won't have to worry about that anymore. Kyle took us off the case. You can have all of my time you want now. - What? Oh okay, so I get the time of day because Kyle took you off the case? So I really am second. Well, that's good Stephen. That makes me feel really good. - Well, you don't understand the kind of commitment this job takes. You don't see the baby getting pulled out of the dumpster in the middle of the night. Or the husband who comes home and beats his wife because she didn't take out the trash. It's hard for me to leave that kind of stuff at work. I lay awake at night thinking about what I'm gonna have to see tomorrow. You think I enjoy a piece of crap feeling like this? - Marry me Stephen because I don't know how much longer I'll be here if you don't. I can't play these guessing games every day. - I'll be back later. We'll go out to a movie or something. - Stephen, don't you walk out on me. We're talking here. - Look, we'll finish later. I can't deal with this right now. - Where are you going? - I don't know. Over to Terrin's probably. - Oh right. - [Stephen] I love you. (jazz music) (knocking) - [Terrin] Ah, company. Surprise, surprise. Melissa throw you out again? - Not exactly. Can I come in? - Yeah, want a beer? - No. It's been hard. She's talking about marriage again. - Well, you two have been together for a while now. - I know, but could you turn that thing down? (jazz music) - Well, if she didn't kick you out then what are you doing here? If you wanted to go shoot pool or something, you should've called. - I've been thinking long and hard about the case. I don't think we should give up so easily. - No, no, no. No, we are not going behind Kyle's back, no way. - [Stephen] We have to. - No, we don't. No. - Look, there's something big about this case. You said so yourself in Kyle's office. We both know that this Dr. Carl is up to something. - Look, I said something in Kyle's office because I didn't wanna get taken off the case. Carl's a killer, but he's a little whacked in the head. You have a degree in psychology. Can't you see that? He probably thinks he's this G.E.C. 1 synthetic humanoid or whatever the hell it's called. The truth is, we got taken off the case and it sucks, but you have to get over it. You can't ponder on this anymore. - If his story is true, then he has pissed off Mother Nature. His little creation is like some kind of a warning that modern science and technology has gone just a little too far. - Let's say the story is true, what are you and I gonna do about it? We can't just go in and blow the place up. - Blow the place up? - Yeah. - Terrin, you gotta sober up seriously. I am not a scientist. I'm a detective. I do my job and I follow my gut, but I do know what happens when you screw around with Mother Nature. Somebody's gotta do something about this. Come on partner, trust me. - All right. All right. Look, if we get caught, you tricked me. - Okay, let's not waste any time. We're going straight up to the lab. - His lab? He's not gonna be in his lab. The guy's whack but he's not stupid. - All right then, we'll talk to his partner. What's his name? - Oh hell, I don't know, Bob, Bobbie. I don't think he's in on it. - At this point, I really don't care. Dr. Carl's the key and we've gotta talk to him and he's the only one that can answer our questions. - Well, we're heading to Pine Top again, huh? Gonna be a long night. - One more thing though, real important. - [Terrin] What? - I'm driving. (keys clanking) (door slamming) (gravel crunching) (wind whistling) (knocking) - Yeah. Hey cops. - Hey Bobbie. - Where's Dr. Carl? - You really think he'd be around here? A couple of your sleazy cop friends, they were here earlier and they wanted to bring me in, but they ain't got nothing on me and I don't know nothing. Do you guys got a warrant or a certificate? - Not exactly. We're not here to search for anything. We just want to know where he is. - Look, I don't know. I got stuff. I got things to do. I'm busy and if you guys know what's good for you, you'll just leave him alone. He's too smart to get caught. - Yeah, he'd have to be to try to kill us. - Listen, I gotta go okay? - Bobbie, where is he? - I don't know. All I do is I share this lab with him and I have every right to be here, every right to keep you out. - Hey, just tell us where he hangs out. Where is he when he's not killing? - Just go. Please, you're interrogating me. Get out of here. - You're damn right we're interrogating you. - What the hell? - Where is he Bobbie? - I don't know. Okay, I don't know. - Bobbie, I'm not gonna be able to hold him back much longer. - I don't know where he is. Okay. There's a club in Pheonix, - A club, good start. - The Blue. The Gate, the Gate. - The Gate. - Wasn't so hard, was it Bobbie? Appreciate it. - You know where that is? - Don't worry Bob. I know where that is. - You're not gonna tell him I told you, are you? You can't tell him I told you. He won't like that. - What's he gonna do Bobbie, kill you? - He'd be upset. You can't tell him I told you. (electronic music) ♪ You said I'm ♪ ♪ You said I'm ♪ ♪ You said I need ♪ ♪ You said I need ♪ ♪ You said love ♪ ♪ You said love ♪ (electronic music) - Oh, excuse me. - Keeping a close eye on me, are we? - Well, I like what I see. You're quite the wild and untamed one. Maybe we should keep you on a leash, huh? (laughing) Oh, allow me. You dropped this. - Thanks hun. - Don't mention it. - Sorry about that. My feet are tripping. Sorry. - My dress, I'm soaked. - You're wet. - I'm gonna have to go to the ladies room and clean up. I'll see you soon. (electronic music) - Sooner than you think. - This is fake. I know fake badges and IDs when I see them. Boys, you shouldn't come around here playing cops and robbers. Bottom line is, you try to cut in line, you can't come in. - I cannot believe this guy. We're detectives already. - Who cares? - If I let everybody in here who said they were something they weren't, the place would be overrun. Back of the line. - Yeah, come on. Get back to the end of the line like everybody else. (electronic music) - Slow down Roxie. Get to know this one first. (electronic music) Hello? There's somebody in here. (electronic music) (rock music) (screaming) - Move out the way. We're in a hurry. If you don't let us through, we're gonna have to arrest you. - Try it tough guy. - All right, I've had enough. - Oh my God. - Terrin, what the hell are you doing? - It's all right, go on ahead. I'll take care of this. - Ma'am, we're police officers. It's all right. - What's this? A colt .45? - You're unprepared for a sawed off shotgun. Take a look here. (screaming) - You just tried to pull a gun on a cop buddy. You're in a lot of trouble. (screaming) - [Stephen] Out of the way people, out of the way. Get them out of here. - All right, look, this is officially a crime scene. Everybody out now, let's go. Move it, come on. Get out. Officially a crime scene, everybody out. Just try to get out of here in an orderly fashion. Go, move, go now. - Carl. Out of the way. (rock music) Freeze Carl. I'll shoot and I won't hesitate, I swear. Carl. - Move it, come on. Get out. (bottles clanking) - [Stephen] Carl, everything's still here. (grunting) - Your plan is too much work Stephen. You don't understand. You don't even understand. I am not responsible for all of this. I did what I had to do. I did what I had to do. My random actions were for the preservation of science. But you don't realize that. He thinks like me, you know? - You sick son of a bitch. - Stop fighting. What are you doing here? - It's all right little boy. I'm a police officer. Just give me the gun. - Daddy, daddy, come quick. - Damn, just settle down little boy. You've got to give me the gun. That's a bad guy and he's getting away. - Yeah, I just wanted to apologize about earlier. There's so many fakes in here. - It's all right, you were just doing your job right? - Yeah, that's right. - Know what though? - What's up? - Sawed offs are illegal. - Oh no. (door slamming) - You really shouldn't be going through another man's personal information. It's not wise Bobbie nor is it very pleasing. - I wasn't looking for anything. I was just trying to find the tissue analysis. - That's not where we keep our notes and you know that. - What are you planning? The cops are here and I don't let them in and they're interrogating me. I didn't tell them nothing, I swear. - I know the cops were here. In fact, it seems that I ran into them. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you Bobbie? - [Bobbie] They just wanted to know where you were. I didn't tell them nothing. - It's funny. I originally got involved in science because I loved zoology. It fascinates me. No other creature has the ability to lie, cheat, and steal like homosapiens do. Well, there's nothing like the black widow though, the queen spider of all. Quite a remarkable creature, don't you think Bobbie? I suppose if there's any organism in this world that can lie, it'd have to be the black widow. She lures her bait in and uses him for reproduction. And then when her mate isn't needed any more, it's disposed of. The males are obviously too dumb to catch on though. They are only spiders after all. I don't know. I suppose a part of me is so obsessed with the idea of another life form, so in need of another at one moment, then at the next it's lights out. Instinct never fails to create the killer inside her. And here we are, creating instinct. Do you ever feel disposable Bobbie? You were an important part of getting this thing up and running. It was harsh Bobbie. Oh, I know the work was harsh on you. Nevertheless, like the black widow's companion, the time your work is needed is brief. (screaming) I didn't need to tail the police. You didn't have to do that. (crying) Life Bobbie, I'll spare you the agony. (gun firing) (upbeat music) (chains clinking) - Show me what you got. Show me what you got. - You ready? Here it comes. (upbeat music) (paper tearing) - Melissa. Oh, I hope I didn't hurt you darling. (laughing) You're going places with me. - Yeah, we'll see you later Kev. - Good team guys. - We'll get you next time man. - See you layer guys. - See you guys. - You hear anything from Phelps and Neally? - Nothing. We're closer to getting Carl than they are, I think. - You never know, man. They could have him cornered somewhere. - Not likely. - I don't know where we're going from here. This guy is a ghost. You know what really phases me? I had him. I had him right in front of me again. That is twice now. I have never wanted to nail somebody so much in my entire life. It's like I'm not trying to catch him anymore. It's like I'm trying to get back my confidence. It's all revengeful now. - Look, this is an important case, man. It means a hell of a lot to me too. It's personal now. We're gonna get this guy and when we do, it'll be a load off everyone's mind, not just yours. - Tell that to Melissa. - She cares, you know. Seems like the most important thing to her is hanging out with you. How are things going anyway? - You always ask me that and I never wanna talk about it. If you really must know, I think she's real pissed off now. - Maybe when this is all over, you should take some time off. She'd like that. - Since when do you keep tabs on what Melissa would like. - I'm not keeping tabs. - Well, maybe you should marry her. - [Terrin] We'll recap tomorrow. - See you later. - [Terrin] If you're lucky. (engine starting) (phone ringing) - Hello. - This is an open channel so I'll make this quick. I've got someone here who would like to say hello. One moment. - Stephen! Stephen! - Melissa! - You'll meet me at my lab in Pine Top in three hours. Just you. You're not gonna screw things up for me anymore. Terrin will have other business. Let him be. He'll behave, don't worry. - He'll kill you. - Why is it some men kill while others create (laughing)? (engine starting) (phone ringing) - Yeah. - [Disguised Caller] Go to 503 West Carrol Drive now, alone. Terrin, Dr. Carl's not the one you're after. - 503 West Carrol? - Quiet. Interference is such a bother. Why do so many people have to try and interfere with the greatest scientific breakthrough of all time? Now. (laughing) Oh, it's time to go now. We are complete here. And you got a hot date with this mountain's edge. A hot date (laughing). - I'm gonna kill him. If he so much as lays a hand on her, I'm gonna kill him. - Look at this, nothing like the mountains. Enough here. from here. You should be quite all right down there now Melissa. Sweetheart, I have to leave you now but he should be along any minute. I've got important business to tend to. Try and be patient. I'll only be a flash. Miss me (laughing). (whimpering) (heart beating) (intense music) - [Dr. Carl] You won't find her in here Detective. - Carl. - Good day Detective. (intense music) That was easier than I predicted. (intense music) (door breaking) (intense music) - Carl? Is that you? What is this, a game to you? - Shit. (coughing) (intense music) - Okay, let's do this right. (intense music) (gun firing) (intense music) (intense music) (gun firing) (glass breaking) - Where are you, you psycho? Come on, show me what you got. - I'm so lonesome, I could cry. Hey, you'll be having company soon. How is it down there, huh? I'm gonna really miss all this sneaking around and stuff. I've gotten pretty good at it, kind of enjoy it. Well, I see your detective sense of detection is working quite nicely, huh Stephen? This isn't going to work. Two men pointing their male extensions at each other? Come on, Detective Kremsin. Why don't you save your energy. If you wanna know where she is, you're going to have to put your gun down. That's a boy. - Now, this isn't going exactly the way I planned. But it's all right as long as I get her back. - Not too close. Why do you hate me so much? It was your own curiosity that got in the way of my genetic plans. What I created was brilliant and beyond any scientific unerstanding. It was remarkable to say the least. Okay, things went haywire at first. They always do. And G.E.C. 1 got loose one night with no pajamas on. But I captured him in less than an hour. He wasn't loose long enough to cause any harm. It was that witness, Charlie Callahan. He saw me stuffing G.E.C. 1 into the trunk of my car. He spoke to you guys. - Doesn't mean you kill him. - I have perfected genetic engineering and I'm prepared to go far with my work. But you don't understand. I had to act on rage. I had to. I had to find the worst possible behavior that a human being is capable of and now that I've perfected genetic engineering, we're not talking about little sheep anymore Detective. G.E.C. 1 was hardly a sheep. And this is the best part, I now have a genetic map on rage and all the way up to their good. I can now. Stay right there. I can now create an exact replica of any man, any man! It's all fixed up so splendidly. You stop right there you son of a bitch. Who's got the gun? - [Stephen] I'm sorry. - That's right. (screaming) (grunting) (upbeat music) Perhaps this is for the better. - No Dr. Carl, this is for the better. (gun firing) (screaming) - Now, can you take some time off? - Plenty (laughing). (birds chirping) You know hun. - What's up babe? - Well, I know you pretty much don't want to talk about it but I really do wanna apologize for getting so caught up like that. - You're right. I don't wanna talk about that today. It's in the past. Just promise me one thing though. Job is number two and your life outside of work is number one. You need to do some more things for yourself. If you wanna keep me around, then make me feel important to you. - I think I can arrange that. There's a situation coming up, though, that's gonna have a lot of my attention. - [Melissa] Oh yeah, what's that? - Our wedding. (soft music) (knocking) Come in. Hey, what are you doing here? You should be at home in bed. - Are you kidding? You didn't think I'd let you take all the credit around here yourself, did you? Who ever said cop life isn't fun? Trust your gut, you get rewarded for it. - I suppose so Terrin, I suppose so. Hey, did they ever figure out who attacked you? - Not exactly. Everybody's pretty sure it was Bobbie though. Haven't seen any trace of the kid. It had to be him. Hey, listen, I just stopped by to say congratulations. Finally gonna do it huh? Tie that knot. Not words anymore partner. - It looks that way. - Hey, congratulations, but you're not out of hot water yet Kremsin. I want a full audio rap on my desk by midday or you'll have hell to pay. - Nothing but the best for you sir. - Hey, I know. - Lunch today? - No, I can't. I'm meeting Melissa. We're picking out the cake. - Make sure you have some of that Jerry's rum cake man. It's delicious. (soft music) - This is Detective Stephen Kremsin. Audio report on the case of Dr. Roger Carl. Dr. Carl was killed two days ago in self defense. (intense music) (intense music) - Ms. Derola, we hold our deepest regrets to you. Dr. Carl must have been very dear. - [Ms. Derola] I need to close his account and collect. - I must say we are truly sorry about the loss. It's quite a claim he's left you. We hope that you yourself will choose First Corporate for any and all future policies. - [Ms. Derola] If you can just wire the money to this Swiss bank account in my name, it would be greatly appreciated. - I'll need some ID. - [Ms. Derola] But of course. (intense music) Good day ma'am. - And good day to you Ms. Derola. (intense music) (upbeat music) - Are you ready Doctor? - As ready as I'll ever be (laughing). They've been closing the file. No one knows who the real you is and who isn't. - I don't know. You're the one who does it. - Well, you do the dirty work and I'll collect (laughing).
