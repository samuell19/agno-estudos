Nothing but bills. I've always made it a rule. Never to open a bill when I know I can't pay it. Telegraph for you, madam. - Oh. Thank you, Fletcher. From my son probably. Martha. Brighton will be home in time for dinner tonight. Edith Gilbert wants him for dinner at the theater tomorrow night. Fletcher. Get Miss Gilbert on the telephone now please. I am afraid, Miss .. What's the matter, Fletcher? I am afraid the telephone is cut off, madam. What? It can't be. Oh, yes it can. That will do, Fletcher. What does this mean? It means Clancy didn't pay the bill today. This wouldn't have happened if Brighton had been here. Oh, of course it would. Neither Brighton nor Clancy have any comprehension of what I go through. How I run this house on nothing at all. Shush. Martha. Clancy hasn't given me one cent this month. And what is much worse .. I haven't given myself a cent this month. For the filthy reason I haven't made one. I told you the telephone would be cut off. I can't cry over a telephone bill. My tailor won't give me my new pants until I've paid for them. Some people are funny that way. London tailors never do that to you. That's one of the important things you got out of your English education. The most important. No cigarettes? And there won't be any heat in the house if the coal bill isn't paid. Who is going to pay it, Clancy? The money Brighton is spending down south would have paid. Very neatly. It was necessary for him to go. He is trying to sell that property. That was a good excuse. I bet a button he didn't sell it. I think he's got a girl down there. That isn't true. Oh, well true or not, mother. You aren't making him marry Edith Gilbert. I'm not stupid enough to let him think I'm trying to force him to do it. Force him? I'd marry her twenty million if she had two heads and a club foot. You let Edith Gilbert alone, Clancy. And both of you, keep your hands off of this. I'm hanging on with everything in me. I know how to manage .. Brighton. He won't fail me. He'll marry Edith. But I want him to fall in love with her first. Glad to see you back. - Thank you. They are waiting for you in the library, sir. Hello. Hello there, mother. - Brighton. Hello, Brighton. - Martha. How are you, Clancy? Oh Brighton. Thank heaven you've come. Why, what's the matter? Very unpleasant things have been happening. And yesterday a summons was served on mother right here in this room. The dressmaker seems to think her bill ought to be paid. He was horrible. I'll never get over it. I wouldn't have had this happen to you for anything on earth, mother. Why did you let it, Clancy? Couldn't you dig up something? What? That's good. And if you don't want it to keep on happening you know how you can stop it. Martha, be quiet. - What would do if you'd been here? Well I can something now. I didn't sell the land while I was down there. I couldn't get enough. We can pay a few bills. Thank heaven. I knew you would, dear boy. You look so well. Did you have a wonderful time? I have something wonderful to tell you, mother. Ahem. Miss Gilbert is calling. Oh .. we aren't .. Oh yes we are. Why not? Hello Edie, come on in. Alright, thanks. How are you, Martha? - Fine. Hello. Brighton, I didn't know you were back. - I just got here. I'm sorry Mrs Lorrimore. I'm afraid I butted in at the wrong time. No dearie, don't be silly. It's always the right time for you, dear. Sure. - And you're in luck. You just caught me. I'm going up near you. I'll let you drop me off. Have to change though. Shan't be a sec'. - I can't wait. You won't have to. I shan't wash behind my ears. I'm so glad to see you. You're just in time for tea. Thank you, Mrs Lorrimore, but I really can't stay. I just dashed in to ask you a question. That Italian marvel wants to paint my picture. Oh yes. And he wants ten thousand for the job. Is he worth it? Nobody on earth is worth that for anything. But you ought to be done by someone who will get your honesty and warmth. Brighton .. show her Martha's portrait. That's the man to paint you. Thank you. - Oh. Sure. Come on, Edie. Awfully glad to see you. You know, my poor old Pa would snort in his grave if he knew I was going to .. Throw away ten thousand dollars? worth of good sausage to have my face painted. Make her stay for tea, Brighton. Twenty millions. And he's got it right in his hands. If he isn't a fool. Don't. Never mind about the picture. I know I crashed in at the wrong time. - That's alright. I can't help knowing it's money troubles. I'm so terribly sorry, Brighton. That's alright, Edie. Things will pull up. It's such a joke, the whole blooming business. I haven't got a doggone thing on earth but money and .. Nothing to do with it but dress myself up and eat too much. I mean. None of this to live up to. It would be worthwhile to save this house. All it stands for. Set things right for you. It's something I'd like to do, Brighton. You don't .. Mean ..? - Yes. That's right. Edith. I just married a girl down south. What? Oh. Yes, I see. Well .. Go on. Tell me about her if you want to. Her father died while I was there and I made her marry me. I've got to tell them now. She's waiting at the hotel. Oh. Is there anything I can do to make it any .. I don't know how to say it, but you know what I mean. I know. Just swell. Brighton. Don't let anyone ever make you sorry you did it. Well. Didn't I tell you I'd make it? Ah well. Goodbye, Brighton. If you need anything, let me know. - Thanks. You can't get away from me. - Don't talk to me, Clancy. I mean it. If you would see that you and I will be a better combination than you and Brighton. We'd be terrible. I'm Kansas. And your Oxford accent gives me a pain in the neck. I'd even cut that out for you, old thing. Well where is Edith? She didn't stay. Why didn't you keep her? I've got something to tell you, mother. I know. You've asked Edith to marry you? I just married somebody else. Phyllis Manning. While I was away. I've known her a year. Are the rooms entirely ready for Mr Lorrimore and Mrs Lorrimore? Yes madam. They are just coming in now. Now Martha, it's done. We have to face it. Just now anyway. There may be a way out. Out? How? What? He's done a terrible thing to us all. He's fallen in love with her. We have to wait until that blows over. Wait with diplomacy. - Oh poppycock, mother. I fell in love once, too. To a man who didn't have any money. And what did you do to me? Fletcher. This is my wife. - Madam. May I offer my congratulations to you both. Thank you. Been paid? - It's all settled. Oh, Brighton. It's marvellous. I never dreamed it would be anything like this. It's a big old boat. It sort of frightens me. Come on now, buck up. Here we go. Phyllis, this is my mother. How do you do. How do you do. And Martha, my sister. How do you do. Hello Brighton. You must be very tired. No, I'm not a bit. I thought you had a long drive. All day yesterday I think you said, Brighton. A day and a half it took us to come up. But I do say that seems very long to me. Sit here by me, my dear. - Thank you. You'll excuse me, won't you. I'm going to market. I do the marketing myself in order to get all I can out of a dollar. I suppose you don't know anything about that? Oh, I've spent all my life seeing how much I can get without a dollar. Oh. Martha manages the entire household. Well, Brighton. So you've fallen in love? Headlong, apparently. It wasn't headlong at all, mother. Phyllis is the only girl I've ever wanted to marry. You'll know why when you know her. I will look after the luggage, Phyl. Do you want everything of yours put upstairs in your room? Please. It's is easy to see why Brighton lost his head and married you. But you look too clever to have married him. A poor man, I mean. Why did you? I only married Brighton for one reason, Mrs Lorrimore. And that was? Because I love him. That's very young .. and very sweet. But my dear child. I'm old. I have seen so much misery and unhappiness because of no money. I am sure you and Brighton are going to be very happy. But I am afraid he didn't tell you just how things are for him. Or you wouldn't have married him. Oh, yes I would. Everything is hard for everybody nowadays, isn't it? It's never been any other way for me. Dad and I would have thought something was terribly wrong if .. Everything had been alright. I'm afraid you don't understand at all. I'm afraid I do. You are telling me that it's a calamity for Brighton to have married me. I'm trying to tell you that I hope it won't be. For you. My son was born into the responsibility of this house and his family. It's an old family and it has been a great one. Now that you are an in-law .. You must know what that means. Now I'm going to let you go up to your room. Fletcher will take you. And then you'll come down and have tea with me, won't you. I can see we are going to be great friends. Fletcher, show Mrs Lorrimore her rooms. Thank you, Mrs Lorrimore. I've put the trunks in the bedroom, madam. Thank you. You will find it all .. Very comfortable when you get a bit used to it. Yes, of course. Well. These are sweet. There is another one here, Miss. Madam. They are white too. I thought that white was most appropriate for a bride. Oh, you put them here? Oh. How very nice of you. Thank you so much. White for a bride. Of course. You can leave some of that on our head if you don't mind. What are you thinking about? Come on, you old married woman. You've been my wife for a whole week. You don't think you can think anything without telling me, do you? Darling. You don't want to tell me how bad things are. But I am so sorry for you I could die. I'm going to help. What? I'm going to work. I'm going to make money. You are great darling, but .. You don't understand. Oh, yes I do. Listen, Brighton. I've always made my own clothes. Every stitch. And I'm good at it darling. I am. And if I can get at it the right way, I can go somewhere with it. There's money in smart clothes and .. I've got something to sell. Phyllis, that's impossible. Why is it? Why the family would raise the roof. - But darling .. I didn't marry your family. I married you. Unfortunately, I'm one of the family. You mean, you believe that stuff about your wife not working? No, I think it's swell that you want to, but .. I can't let you do it, Phyl. What do you mean? I mean I'm going to take care of you myself. I'm in a tough spot just now but I'm going to get out of it. Father and grandfather made money just like that. I don't know why I shouldn't. I've got to. That's all there is to it. But that's not what you're meant for. Why should you be a broker just because your father was? You've got something better than that. You oughtn't to do anything but write. The stories you sold are great. You know you've got the real thing. You know it. Of course, I'd rather write than anything else in the world but .. I can't chuck the family. I know. I know. But if we could only live alone. I wouldn't care where. One room, just so it was ours. Can't we do that, dear? You bet we can. Someday. But why put it off? Why can't we begin now? I can't help myself, Phyl. I've told you. You haven't said anything important. Oh yes, I have. I can't walk out on mother and Martha. Brighton, I can't live this way. I can't breathe. I'm going to work and if I can't work and live here, then .. I must go. That's all. You mean without me? - If you won't come with me, yes. What if I tell you you can't? You can?t tell me that. - Oh, yes I can. You are my wife, you know. - But I am myself too. That's pretty unreasonable, Phyl. I've told you I can't give up. My job is to keep this family where it always has been. And you'll have to stay here until I can take you someplace else. Phyl. Darling. I'm sorry. Me too. Oh you're right. Everything you say. But there is the other side to it, too. - Oh I know, I know. I'm going to get you out of this some way. There is one thing that will do it Phyl, if I put it over. Can you hang on a little while longer? - Of course, darling. Then will you go to sleep .. Believing we're alright. Knowing it. Oh, darling. You don't know how much I love you. Believe in you. Is the house on fire? I was waiting to see if you would do something about it. I take it you don't care for toast. Not the burnt variety. For a slight tax on your intellect you can watch and get it before it burns. I'm sorry. I have no sense of time whatever. Oh! I burn myself up too. Oh, that's rotten. Why in blazes don't you have Fletcher do this? Fletcher is already doing the work of ten men. Well, make it eleven. Let him give us a decent breakfast. Good morning, mother. - Good morning. Did you sleep well, mother? I don't know why you keep on asking me that. You know I didn't. Well .. one must say something to get through this breakfast performance. Could you bear a grape, mother? I could not. What is that? Oh that? That's a little parlor incinerator we're trying out. You don't take toast on Sunday do you, mother? Oh nonsense. Where is Brighton? I never see him anymore. You don't expect to, do you? Martha. I want you to change your tactics entirely towards Phyllis. I want you to be kind to her. You want me to be what? Be kind to her. And let mother slowly and tactfully make her beloved son see .. What a calamity Phyllis is. And get rid of her. Divorce her. Are you capable of thinking such a thing, Clancy? Quite capable. You still haven't given up Edith Gilbert for Brighton have you? Oh stop it, Clancy. Sorry. Morning everybody. I said "good morning". Oh good morning. Where is Phyllis? She didn't want any breakfast. I took her a cup of coffee. I hope she isn't ill. - Not a bit. Mother and I would like our breakfast in bed too. I suppose you would like another maid so Phyllis can have hers in bed? That's enough, Martha. I've stood all I'm going to of that. - Brighton. You've not been decent to Phyllis since she came in the house. She doesn't belong here. And you did a ghastly, unfair thing to all of us when you brought her here. I'm taking here away. - Oh, are you? You can afford another house, I suppose? - Be quiet both of you. You know what you're saying is impossible, Brighton. No it isn't impossible. There is a way out of this for all of us. What? Sell the house. Never. Look, mother. I've had a very decent offer for it for a club. A man's club. It gets us out of an awful lot of debt. You'd have enough to live on .. I absolutely forbid it. I've waited for all of you to do something. Make the right marriages. The right business connections. Go on from where your father left you. You haven't done it. You've failed me. All of you. Now, I am going to do something myself. - What, mother? I'm going to appeal to Martin Deering. You will only humiliate yourself. Don't be afraid I shall humiliate myself. Your father brought me into this house. I'm not going to let you take me out of it. I shall do something myself now. My way. I want to ask your advice about something, Martin dear. If it's the stock market dear, I .. - It's not. It is Brighton. He has a wild idea about selling this house. Well, why not? These old homes eat their heads off. There are only a few of them left. - I'm left. And all that I represent will stay alive in this house as long as I'm alive. You are a grand old warhorse, cousin Emmeline. I've had to be. Things are pretty desperate for us, Martin. Oh, sorry. Don't be uncomfortable. I'm not going to borrow money. Is something amusing going on up there? Mother has always been keen about Martin. He is the success of the family. I'm just going to ask you to put Brighton in the way of something. All he needs is a chance. A chance is easy enough, dear lady. It all depends upon what the man does with it. Brighton is in great luck about one thing. This attractive girl. My grape? - Oh. Thank you. I thought you were going to dig me up. - I wanted to but I didn't dare. Why not? I'm shy. I almost telephoned you once or twice. Then I thought .. Well, why should a happy bride want to see me? You know you lie. And don't forget. - Indeed I shan't. Oh, I left my slipper under the table, Clancy. Under the ..? - Uhuh. Would you be a woolly lamb and get it, darling? Could I be of any help, madam? Thank you, no. Mr Clancy likes doing it. Yes, I'm a woolly thing. Is this it? Yes, How many are there? Just .. just put it on please. Just slip it on, Clancy. - I'm trying to. Clancy, what on earth are you doing? It can't be done. Are you sure you've had this on before? Don't be an idiot. It's so big it fell off. Fletcher, give me something. - Perhaps one of these might ..? Yes, I think .. Careful, careful Clancy. Oh, Clancy. You might at least try a spoon. Spoon. Martin seemed very much interested in you at dinner. Now is the opportunity of your life to do something for us. What, Mrs Lorrimore? Make yourself agreeable to Brighton's cousin. Well, of course. Are you people alright here? - Good, thank you. But where is your four? I'm glad you're not my partner, Clancy. - We're waiting for Brighton or Martin. Oh, I'll go and get one of them. Oh, nice new cards. How gay. Don't tell me there is a new deck of cards in the Lorrimore family. I wish they'd put new faces on them too. I'd play a much better game if the King and Queen were more responsible. Here is a new joker. Will he help your game? No. Horrid. No. He looks just like my first husband. You don't want him to look like the last do you? He couldn't, darling. There is never going to be a last. I see you haven't let this family knock the life out of you yet. It will be my own fault if they do, won't it? You're a good deal of a person, aren't you. I'll bet my hat you'll get up and walk out of this one day. Brighton will. How about you? Are you having any fun? Of course. How? I've only been here two weeks. New things are always interesting. Whether you like them or not. Some new things are very interesting. What's the matter? Is my nose shiny? You let that nose alone. I like it. Well I don't. I'm more tired of my nose than anything in life somehow. Look here. You and Brighton come down to the country this weekend, will you? I'd love to if Brighton can. What do you like to do? Ride and swim? That kind of thing? I was born on a horse. I would rather ride than anything in the world. - Good. I knew we liked the same things. The best horse I've got will be waiting for you. And incidentally, I shall too. Well I .. I wish I didn't have to go now. Why do you? I'm catching a plane for Washington. Business. You know, I thought I would be glad of an excuse to get away tonight but .. I'm not. Lots of luck. I've had my luck for one evening. Well that's set then. This weekend. I'll send a car for you. By the way, I'll be out of town for a few days. Why don't you use the car? - That's awfully nice of you. But if it isn't an old Ford I shouldn't know what to do with it. Don't be so snooty. And you're coming to the country whether Brighton does or not. No. If he does. Here is Brighton now. Oh, you're not leaving? She seems to be still in love with you, Brighton. Still. Well goodnight. I'll go and speak to your mother. See you Sunday. She'll tell you about it. Goodnight. Goodnight. He's fun. Big people are so nice and little, aren't they. I wish you wouldn't hurry off so, Martin. Sorry. Awfully sorry. Got to be done. Goodnight, my dear. Goodnight. Thank you, Fletcher. I know mother has got some sort of a scheme up her sleeve. If she hits Deering for a loan .. - Pull up your socks, darling. There is going to be some way of this. - I'm sick of the whole mess. What's the matter, Brighton? Oh nothing. I was just telling Phyllis she had to come and fill in. She will in a moment. I want to speak to her. Brighton is desperate. Frantic. So am I. Have you no comprehension of what's going on, Phyllis? What? Of what's hanging over him. Yes. Yes. Yes, I have Mrs Lorrimore. I know exactly what's hanging over Brighton. And what you expect him to do and I think it is all terribly unfair. What do you say to me? You expect him to make a lot of money on a big scale. But he can't. Why should he? It isn't what he's meant for. He's got so much bigger things in him than that. You haven't the faintest realization of what it means to have married my son. It means to be told every day, every minute. It's the worst possible thing he could have done. I asked you to do a little thing that would have helped me. To be agreeable to Martin Deering. Bur evidently, you were so indifferent to him .. That he was bored to death and couldn't get away fast enough. What? Why, he asked Brighton and me there for the weekend. He offered me his car while he was away. Is that what you want? - Oh, Phyllis. Thank you. That's just what I .. - Don't thank me. I didn't do anything, I assure you. I say it's very cheap to be nice to a man to get him to do favors for your husband. I wouldn't insult Brighton with that. I wish you were coming. I wish I were too, but I promised the boys to make up that foursome. Bored old married man running away from wife. How about the sporty young wife running away from husband? Don't let me stop you. Oh, you came just in time to protect me. Oh what a day. I did the best I could for you. Well, tally ho. If you don't bring back a 72 in the bag .. No more Sunday foursomes in your married life. Goodbye, darling. - Goodbye. You look pretty jaunty, you two. - We know we do. The view I like best around here is up there. Want to have a look? - Yes, I'd love to. Like it? - Hmm. You ought to have a view of your own. - I think so too. Well, why don't you? - We're going to. We won't have much house but a great deal of chimney. Why so much chimney? So we can collect more house around it as we go. No reason why you shouldn't collect quite a lot of house. No reason why Brighton shouldn't make money. He might have to look around and find something up his street. Would you like that? I certainly wouldn't unless it was something he could do awfully well. He's got a streak of his own. He could go a long way up. Did you ever hear of somebody going up into a higher place? And offering somebody all the kingdoms of the world. For something in return? Yes. For something in return. It was Satan who did it I believe. I see you know your bible. - Yes. But I don't happen to want kingdoms. They don't spell anything for me. Don't be an ing?nue. I'm in love with you and you know it. What are you going to do about it? And you know I'm in love with my husband. What are you going to do about that? Lena, go away. Well I'm not going any place. - Oh, but I am. Not yet, please. She's pursuing me. Oh, alright. I'll be down in a minute. Brighton, where are you? I'm alright, Phyl. Hello, Martin. - Want this? No thanks. - No? It's a beautiful place, Martin. - Pretty good, isn't it. Cigarette? - Fine. Well, how are things going for you these days? You've got a pretty tough load to carry in these tough times. It's not my game, making money. - Oh nonsense. You just aren't in right. You didn't get a light. Thanks. Look here. I have a place I haven't found the right man for. It needs personality and adaptability more than hard-boiled experience. It doesn't pay a big salary. Pretty good commissions with it. Why don't you come in and see me if it interests you at all. Interests me? I'll be at your office at five o'clock tomorrow morning. Right. Well, you look like a couple of lifeguards. Ah, look at that. Are you swimming Martin, or just modelling that outfit? No, at the moment I'm showing off my physique. When I get one of those big drinks maybe I'll have the nerve to go in. Here, take mine. I don't want it. - No thanks. I want a real one. Martin, you must come and dance with me, darling, before you get all wet. You always have been the most divine dancer. Wait, wait. I must have a drink first. Besides, I don't know how I am at barefoot dancing. Well, all you need to do is make up your toes, sweet lamb. Aren't you going in the pool? - Certainly not. It is much more clever to stay dressed. And make people think how wonderful I'd be undressed. Two Highballs, please. How you doing, mister? Phyl. - What? Martin's offered me something. - What? At least he's asked me to come in and talk to him about it. Well, what will it be? Well I don't know but he seems to think it?s something I could get away with. But, is it really what you want, dear? Is it what I want? Is it what I want? Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy? Why did he say that, I wonder. Do you mind? I'm not dressed for this. Why aren't you? I'm an excellent swimmer my friend but I don't look my best in a bathing suit. Well you certainly do, Lena. Why aren't you in? No, I never go in the water. But I adore the air on my body. It doesn't sound quite proper to me. Oh, I love to be in danger. Come on darling. Bounce me. Alright, I'll do what I can. There we are. Oh, I say, look at her. Look at her! There she goes. Do something, will you. It's up to you, Bally. My goodness. Come on, dear. Save her, darling. Save her! Courage. Courage. That's all it wants. Perfectly simple. You silly little girl. Perfectly simple, old boy. I'd like to have you done in marble. Just that way. So you stay there. I feel like my own tombstone. Did Brighton tell you? Hmm. Well you don't seem very happy about it. Of course I am. Only .. Brighton is so happy it sort-of frightens me. You see I never realized before what not making money has done to him. Well, we must see that he does make some. Oh. I haven't had new one in so long. Where are my gloves? Where are my gloves? - Right there. - Oh yes. I think you've made a mistake not to come, Martha. Brighton's first Sunday in his new apartment. Well, I don't. I'm not so keen about the new apartment as the rest of you are. I think it would have been much saner of Brighton to pay off some more debts. Before he plunged quite so much. Oh, nonsense. Shall I wear this up? Or .. down? Down. It makes you look more like Queen Victoria. I'm beginning to feel a little more like the dear old lady again. As if I were coming back into my own kingdom. Thank you. - There you are. Now remember, mother. You've going to tell Phyllis that this flirtation with Martin has got to stop. But that is so childish. Don't try to wriggle out of it, mother. Tell her you'll not go on Martin's yacht this week, so of course she can't go. But I want to go. You are so old-fashioned, Martha. Alright. If you don't do it, I'll get hold of Brighton tonight. People are talking I tell you, and it's got to be stopped. All exaggerated nonsense. Brighton is as pleased as punch that Deering likes Phyllis. It helps to make her a success. Where is Fletcher? Let me out. - Not until you promise. Yes, yes. I promise. The car is here, madam. It is a beautiful car, madam. The beautiful thing is that my son gave it to me. I know. I know, madam. Things will all come right again now, Fletcher. And you will be taken care of entirely. Very soon now. Certainly, madam. Don't think of it. Thank you very much. Alright, Johnson. You're pretty good at skidding over dangerous ground. You can't keep it up for ever you know. How about it, Missy? - Take my hat off, please. Thanks. Cigarette? - No thanks. You just don't want anything, do you. No. But you do. You've got a lot of power in your hands, my dear. Why don't you use it? I've a lot in my hands at the moment, you'd better not talk to the driver. Go to it. You hair is nice in the wind. Well, goodbye. - Aren't you coming up? No. Listen, Phyllis. Do you want Brighton to go to Mexico on the oil proposition? Or not? It's so big, Martin. Can he do it? I have to send him or another man tomorrow. I'm human. And I'm in love with you. Do you want him to have it? Or not? I see. Be a good sport Martin, and let's call it a day. You've given me a grand world and I've liked it. Much too much. But I do want you to know this. I honestly did think that you'd begun to believe in Brighton. But if he isn't good at what he's doing .. If he isn't doing it himself. The sooner he finds out about it the better. He'll have to lose the Mexico thing. And .. Everything else. Brighton is having dinner with me tonight to talk about it. You are a very foolish little girl. No, you don't really think that? Brighton will tell you himself tonight that .. Well, he'll know what he wants to say. Bye-bye, Martin. And thanks for .. Today. It really wasn't your fault that Molly's party was a headache. No, no. Nutty, nutty no. Well, we're off. - Goodbye, dear. I wish you wouldn't go. - We must, darling. The whole apartment and everything in it is too divine. You've been so clever about it. You did a swell job, Phyllis. - Thanks, Clancy. I'd say so. Absolutely. My dear, did you do it yourself? Yes, Brighton thought I'd better do it myself rather than somebody else do me. I didn't quite get that. Don't understand it at all. I can't believe that, darling. What? Where have you been, Phyllis? Been in Greenwich with Martin Deering. - To one of Molly Brown's arty-parties. Glad you didn't go. You'd have hated it. I hope you got what was coming to you for going. Yes, rather. What did he say? Come along, Bally. We're going to Edith's for tea. Are you coming, Clancy? Where is he? - Why, he's .. He is .. I don't suppose he's out there somewhere. I don't know where he is. I hope that horrid little Clancy realizes I'm doing all I can .. To keep you from Edith and her money. I work day and night. But I haven't diverted you. Not for a minute, have I my sweet. On the contrary, you are most dangerously diverting, my dear. You divert me so tremendously, at times I don't know what you divert me from. If you know what I mean. Phyllis. Look, I owe Edith a hundred dollars that I borrowed at the races. If you could let me have it for a day or two .. Why, Clancy. You can't owe Edith anything. Wait a minute. Here is your hat, sir. - Oh, is that a hat? I wonder where I got that. Thanks very much. You never remember anything, do you darling. Goodbye, dears. - Goodbye. Here it is. Now give it to her right away. You bet I will. You're a honey. Well, darling? I hope you've had a better time entertaining the boss than I did the .. Customer from Chicago. Brighton. I want to talk to you. You know, Phyl. Sometimes I think Deering believes in me and sometimes I .. Sometimes you ..? What? A month ago I was sure he was going to send me to Mexico on the oil deal. Now he's cooled off. If he doesn't say tonight at dinner that it's sure, I know he's letting me down. Why don't you tell him you don't want it? Give it up yourself. Why, you're insane. The Mexico thing will either make me or break me. Mrs Lorrimore. Oh. Hello, mother. Good. Glad to see you. - Phyllis. I wondered if you weren't coming in today. Won't you have some sherry or something? - No thank you. Oh, it is enchanting. Some tea, then? Tea? Your granny's hind leg. I've just come from one cocktail party and I'm on my way to another. Pretty gay, I'd call that. - Yes. Pardon me. Mr Deering wishes to speak to you, Mr Lorrimore. Oh. Alright. Excuse me. We really don't need a fire, but .. It smells so good. This glorious Indian summer. By the way, dear. You've told Martin Deering you are going on his yacht this week of course? No, I'm not going. What? I don't want to. Oh well, I'm not so awfully keen about it myself. But I wouldn't dream of refusing for Brighton's sake. Martin wants you. To make his party a success. And it is your duty to go. Now is the crucial time of Brighton's career. You think Brighton's success is the most important thing in the world, don't you? Yes. I do. And I certainly expect you to. You owe it to him. To all of us. To do everything in your power to help him. If Deering pushes Brighton on .. His marriage will be such a .. Say it. Marrying me won't be such a .. Calamity after all. Well, Brighton. I must run along. Oh, so soon? - Yes, really. The car is so beautiful, Brighton darling. Bless you. I'm so happy at seeing you and Phyllis so happy. Dear boy. Goodnight to both of your, darlings. Goodnight. Goodnight, mother. - Goodnight. Thank you. I'm not going on the yacht, Brighton. That was Deering's secretary on the phone. Yes? He's called off the dinner tonight. He's stalling. I know what that means. Would it be an awful disappointment Brighton if you didn't get it? Disappointment? It would mean he's through. Well, what of it? Your life doesn't depend on Martin Deering. Don't talk like a fool, Phyllis. But if another man is better for the job .. You can't blame Deering. No. No, I can't. But I blame him for lying to me. Telling me I made good on all the other .. Maybe I have been a piker at everything. Maybe he's only been decent to me because my mother appealed to him. There is something you can do on your own, out of yourself. Without depending on anybody else. - You mean: writing? A swell job I'd do at that now. I couldn't write a 2-cent word. And what if I did? Do you think that would pay the bills? You think it would get us out of the old dump into this? - Dearest, wait. I'm head over heels in debt. I'm worse off than ever if I lose this thing. You are not if we don't lose each other. That's what I'm afraid of. Ever since you started making money, it's been first with you, not me. You are changing. We both are. We aren't being what we're meant to be to each other. We aren't doing the things we are meant to do. How about you? Haven't you liked it, the way we've lived, the money you've spent? Yes. Yes, I've liked it. I've like it too well. I've spent too much. Let's stop. Brighton. I'm going to tell you something. - Don't tell me any more. Don't be noble. Don't talk to me about living in one room on bread and cheese. We couldn't do it. That's what would make us lose each other. Brighton, look at me. If we can't face this together, losing everything .. Then we are no good. That's all. That's easy enough for you to say. You've never had anything. You don't know what it's all about. Oh, don't I? You all think I'm nobody at all. No, I don't mean that. But you don't know anything about money. Don't I? If money is the most important thing in the world, let's have it. I'll show you whether I know anything about it. Make it. Make it. If money is all you want, it's all I want. What's the use of anything else? - You bet I'll make it. Watch me! Hello? Martin, it's Phyllis. I want Brighton to have it. Yes. Yes. The yacht. Yes, of course I will come. Why not? Be quiet everyone. Quiet, Gladys. Phyllis is trying to tell you something. Of course you all think you're saying something worth hearing but you're not. Oh Billy, say something. Shut up will you. Phyllis is going to make a speech. I only meant just tell and don't say anything. Quick, Phyllis. The most marvellous thing has happened. Brighton flew to Mexico this morning. He has gone on the great job. Swell. Oh, it makes me so emotional. Oh, my dear. Oh Phyllis, darling. I say, we must drink to somebody or something. You're going to make us all cry, Clarissa. Congratulations. - Thank you, Baron. And to you, Madame. - Thank you. I'm very proud and very happy naturally. I want to propose a toast to Martin. To thank him for his confidence in giving my son a brilliant opportunity. To Martin! And will he make a pot of money, Martin? He will, if things go well for him. To Martin, who makes careers. I am drinking to Phyllis and her success. The Lorrimore success story when Brighton married her. I .. I am being awfully honest. I .. I love to be honest. You are much more amusing when you are lying, darling. Of course I am, my sweet. I'm just trying to say you ought to be the happiest girl in the world. I am. Only Brighton is the hero of this hour. He is up in the sky somewhere now. Flying into a great future. I give you Brighton and his career. His glittering, shining, unbelievable career. Brighton! - Brighton! Here you are, Mr Deering. - Thank you. I'm awfully sorry to be late. - You did pretty well for you. Rather, you only missed the first act. - I know. Too bad. Where is Phyllis? Phyllis isn't coming. She got a wire from Brighton. He may land tonight. - Oh yes, yes. The young man pulled off a pretty good job down there. Hello. - Clarissa. Of course I am not speaking to you at all, pet. Why didn't you come to dinner? I absolutely couldn't make it, dear. When I could phone, you'd gone. Which reminds me. Will you excuse me, Miss Gilbert? I'll be back before the curtain goes up. - Yes, of course. I'm sure Martin always accepts 3 invites and makes the choice at the last minute. Don't you think the new singer is marvellous? Who cares if he does make a noise like a flute. I'd rather hear the flute. Jolly good. Well, to be as lowbrow as I honestly am, I prefer Mickey Mouse. [ German language ] No, that's our new national anthem. It's three days since we got off the yacht. Isn't that a long time? When am I going to see you? I don't know. I'll call you. Please understand, Martin. Goodnight. So the husband is coming back, what? Don't husbands usually come back? Whose husband? The fellow that Deering sent away. What's his name now? It is .. I haven't the dimmest idea what you're talking about, Bally. And neither have you, I expect. What? Why talk about husbands unless you have something constructive to offer like .. How to keep them from getting fat or bald-headed. You know, you're usually pretty bright, my dear. Have I got to be obvious and say who the husband is? Mother, I don't believe you've met Major Ballinger. This is Miss Lorrimore, Major Ballinger. Oh yes. How do you do. Oh. Yes. How do you do. Come along, Bally. You're going to need a nice long drink before the next act. You are an idiot, Bally. Yes, I do chatter rather a lot don't I. Is that what you call it? Oh, Barrett. Will you ask my mother to come and speak to me please. Capisce. Please bring my wrap for Mrs Lorrimore. You are not leaving so early are you, Miss Lorrimore? Yes, I am very tired. - That it too bad. The way she cuts loose in the last act is nobody's business. What on earth ..? - We are going home. Why? I've just heard a very ugly thing very plainly hinted at. I told you once before and you promised me you'd tell Phyllis. I don't know what you're talking about. - Oh yes you do. Thank you. I tell you I hadn't the slightest idea. You are coming to Phyllis now. And we are going to get at the truth. [ Doorbell ] Where is Miss Lorrimore? - In the living room, sir. Phyllis. I've got to have 3,000 dollars quick. Can you give it to me? I've got to have it. I've simply got to. - Oh yes? More money. If I don't get it it's the end of me in this own. I haven't got 3,000 dollars. Brighton is in this too. I used his name. How dare you. It is horrible, Clancy. The things you do. The way you live. That's pretty funny. And how do you live? How does Brighton get his money? What? Deering has put Brighton where he is because he wanted you. Because he's got you. Give me the money or I'll tell Brighton. I won't give it to you. Oh. So you're not afraid of Brighton? And he knows, too? I thought he did. You know it isn't true! Everybody knows it is true. What is this? What are you saying, Clancy? - You keep out of this. Both of you. You two .. - Be quiet, Martha. You all know, don't you. What is it we all know? About Martin and me. Phyllis. No matter what you've done, now is the time we must hang together. We will forgive you and help you. If you'll hold your tongue and do as I say. Forgive me? Well, I don't forgive you. When you sat and said Brighton's success .. Was the most vital thing in the world. I knew you wanted it, no matter how. It's what you all want, more than anything in the world. Money, money, money. Well, you've got it now. Don't talk about forgiving me. What you think of me isn't of the slightest importance. Phyllis, don't lose your head. Never tell Brighton. If you do as I say I'll protect you. I don't want your protection. Hello. Oh. Phyllis, my love. - Brighton. What's the matter? Is anything wrong? No, no. Of course not. Dear boy. We left the opera early. Just to see you. Now that you're here safe, why .. We'll run along. - Oh, well you don't have to. Oh yes. Come, Clancy. Come in and see me tomorrow. Tell me about your trip. Did you make good time? Yes, I flew back in 22 hours. - That's pretty good. Phyllis. You aren't going to tell Brighton? I don't know what I'm going to do. Don't. It will kill him. Shall I wait up for you, Mrs Lorrimore? No thank you, Marie. Goodnight. Goodnight, Mrs Lorrimore. Are you glad to see me as I am to see you? I'm so glad, I .. Can't speak. I thought about you every second. Day and night since I've been away. And all the rotten things I shot off the night before I left. Is it .. Is it alright, Phyl? Of course. Let's not talk about it. Why, you're great, darling. I didn't .. didn't bring you anything because .. I want to know what you .. What's the matter? You mean, you haven't got over our fight? Oh no. No, I .. I'm just so glad to have you back. It's alright, Phyl. The whole thing. I put it over. It's bigger than Deering thought it would be. He is going to put me .. What is it, Phyllis? If only you hadn't gone. I'm never going to leave you again. I can tell you that. Don't think of all the things that are knocked off me that you want me to be. Oh, darling. Don't think I've forgotten the little house. And all the rest of it. It wasn't only that the house was going to be little, but .. It was the way we were going to live in it. I know. But we're going to live now, you bet. Listen, Phyl. Deering is going to put me as head of .. - You can't go on! What do you mean? You can't take anything more from Martin Deering. What? He didn't want you. He wanted me. Me! Not you. You're lying. It's true. It can't be. Remember all the things we said to each other that day? Well, nothing seemed to me .. To matter much. So long as we got the things we thought we had to have. Not that way, you .. It all seems impossible that .. And awfully silly now. Doesn't it? If we could begin again. Put all this away and .. And try for the things we meant to. Oh. That couldn't be. Could it. Phyllis. Phyllis. Phyllis. Phyllis. Phyllis! Phyllis! Coffee, please. They look good. They are good. I finally found out .. Where you work. And where you lunch. My hat is off to you, Phyllis. You can put it right back on again. No applause coming for me for doing what I like doing. I wish you hadn't done this, Martin. I'm going to have some of those. You will have to go get them yourself. Oh. Then I won't waste time. It is three months since I've seen you, Phyllis. I must eat my lunch and get back. The three months have made me realize something I .. I was a good deal of a fool not to have known before. Will you marry me? I've been divorced for ten years. I never dreamed of asking any other woman to .. I love you, Phyllis. Oh, let it all alone, Martin. There is nothing that can be said or done about it. Oh yes there is. A great deal that can be said and done. Marry me, Phyllis. That would be the most cowardly thing I could possibly do. What do you mean? Why in the name of heaven shouldn't you marry me? That isn't the way back for me. The way back to what? To myself. You mean, you don't .. Like me well enough to marry me? I love Brighton. Do you .. Expect him to .. Come back to you? No, I don't. I guess I don't know want any more. Look here, the care is out there. Let me take you back to .. - No, thanks. Please, it isn't far. I like the walk. - But I'm not giving up, Phyllis. I'm going to see you again. I am awfully grateful for what you've said, Martin. But. Well, I can come and eat griddle cakes with you anyway. They are a very bad habit. That evening gown is very good on you, Miss Gilbert. Yes, very. This tail train is most effective. I'll probably look like a fish in it, but I'll take it. Ah thank you, Miss Gilbert. I wish a few more of Miss Manning's friends would give us some good orders. We took her on the strength of that. My dad used to say that in his business best friends make the worst customers. But you picked a very clever girl anyway, didn't you, Mrs Hicks. Phyllis Manning is much more than just a decoy. Oh yes, we know that. She has good clothes sense. Well, I took it. - You did, huh? I'll wait for you in here. - Alright. So Miss Gilbert bought her weekly dress? It embarrasses me, she buys so much. You are very foolish, Miss Manning. If you would assure Mr Tompkins that we could dress Miss Gilbert entirely .. It would help you on here a lot. - Hmm. Well, I'm going now. Think it over. And don't make a rash decision. If I can make the Lexington Avenue car, that's all I ask. Goodnight. Goodnight, Mrs Hicks. That will be all, thank you. Here you are. Well. I can't bear it. Me standing here with nothing to do but write checks. And you sitting there with swollen feet for $25 a week. Why on earth won't you let me go in with you and open a little shop of our own? I can tell you something better than that to do, Edie. What? Marry Brighton. Does that mean that you and he are going to get a divorce? Of course. He should have married you in the first place. He'll never think that. Oh yes, he will. Brighton and I were .. an accident. A ghastly .. mistaken .. accident. At least it didn't last very long. You and he will be right. Never mind about me, but .. I hope this means you're going to marry Martin Deering. I'd be a fool not to, wouldn't I. Phyl. I want you and Brighton to be awfully happy, Edie. Tell him that from me, won't you? I'll wait for you downstairs in the car. - Oh, don't wait. Martin's car is probably down there. Really, Phyl? That's grand. I know just how you feel, Suzie. Nothing to do but wear a hat all day. No! I forbid it. I always have and I always shall. I forbid you to sell this house as long as I am alive. It's done, mother. I closed the deal today. Two hours ago. Brighton. It meant selling now or having it sold over our heads. I don't want a dollar of it. You three can do what you like. Oh, really? I resent this, Brighton. You've overstepped your rights. Don't be a fool, Clancy. We would have been put out if he hadn't done it. What will become of me? Where shall I go? Well. You'll give up most of the things you've had all your life. Just as other people do. We'll move into a small apartment. And have one servant and be darned lucky to get it. Cheer up, mother. You're going to live in the slums. You talk like an idiot, Martha. I won't submit. If you had listened to me in the first place. You wouldn't have married a girl who has brought disaster to you. We brought it to her. What? - Yes. We pushed her into it. The things we want, the way we live. What we think we are. Who are we anyway? What are we? Have anyone of the four of us ever taken care of ourselves alone, on our own? Not for a minute. We've been living on what somebody else made. Using it up. Seeing it go. Without having the spine to call a halt and face the music. I blame myself for all of it. Everything that's happened. Not Phyllis. Touching to hear such a noble defence of your virtuous wife. [ Punch sound! ] What was that? I hope it was just what you think it is. Mr Lorrimore. Goodbye, Fletcher. Clancy. What did Brighton do? What did he do? Well .. To put it simply mother, he socked me right in the puss. Miss, can you tell, does Mrs Lorrimore work here? I don't know. Do you, Gertie? Lorrimore? No, I never heard of her. She don't work here. Are you sure? - I don't know nobody like that. Pardon me. Can you tell me, does Mrs Lorrimore work here? Or maybe Miss Manning? What department is she in? Well, I'm not sure. I think she sells hats or dresses, maybe. I wouldn't know her. I'm in corsets. How did you know where I was? I made Edith tell me. I've got a job in a newspaper office. I've been there a week now, so I guess it's alright. That's great. I've got one, too. I've been here three months and they haven't fired me yet. You look tired. Of course. So do you. I'm so tired, every n?ght I could die, but .. I want to live. Are you going to marry Deering? No .. no .. no. You have so much more to forgive than I have. I don't even know how to say ?t. Phyl. You used to say you'd live in one room with me. I think we could have two. Would you? Darling. That would be such splendor. New splendor. That we never knew anything about. * steve d *
