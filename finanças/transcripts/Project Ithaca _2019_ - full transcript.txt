The door is closed. A basic force dynamic expression. The presence of two force exerting elements. The expression, "the door is closed" is force dynamically neutral. Good. The door cannot open. There's a recognizable force dynamic pattern. The door has some tendencies toward opening but there is another force preventing it from being opened. And what opens the door? To open the door requires an opposing dynamic force. Which is? The antagonist. A force entity with the intrinsic force tendency towards action. Is the antagonist always visible? No. A gust of wind made the pages of my book turn. Okay, now you're just showing off. Sera. Can it be opened? Yes. What opens the door? Afraid. Sera, what do you see? People. They're screaming. Sera, who's screaming? Everyone. Shut it down. Shut it down! Jesus, baby, don't you ever get tired? What the... Where am I? Son of a bitch! Fuck. Who the fuck are you? Hey! I'm talking to you! Well, would you say something for fuck sake? Fuck. Oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck. Oh, just calm down. This isn't real. This isn't real, it can't be. No, it's just a dream. Just a very... bad... dream. General. We've lost Sera's transmission, sir. Damn. Well, I guess that's that. Thank you. You're dismissed. Sir, we've actually received a second transmission... coming from the same location. They're waiting for you down in science. Tell them I'm on my way. Will do. One more thing, sir. Agent Brighton has disappeared. Shit. Hello? Hello? So, are you gonna at least say something? Can you at least tell me your name? Sera. This wasn't part of the plan. Who the hell are you? John. I'm Zack. Sera. Sera, do you know who I am? Sera, it's me. It's Agent Brighton. The door. Is it open? Something about this isn't right. Why send her up incognizant. It doesn't make sense. Unless... Zack, have they made contact? What? No. It could indicate a remote interface. No, no, that doesn't follow, the interface requires a hardwire. Call me Zack Chase. - Zack Chase. - Yeah. Mm. Devil got you good. Amber, you classy gal. I'm your classy gal. What's happening to her? Devil got you good. What did she say? - Sera, can you understand me? - Uh, how'd she do that? - Do what? - I'm your classy gal! - That! - Sera. I wanna know how she did that! Zack, calm down. Calm down? Don't tell me to fuckin' calm down! Hey! I'm talkin' to you! God. Let me out. Let me out. Let me out! Let me out, let me out, let me out! Let me out, let me out, - let me out! - Miss, listen to me. You have to remain calm. Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God! Let me out, let me out, let me out! Lady, please, you're just-- You're making it worse, okay? Too late, she's flooding. What the hell is flooding? Let me out, let me out, let me out! That. Lady, please, just you gotta listen to-- No. Let it happen. Let what happen? Good. - That's good. - Good? How can that be good? Lady, please, just listen to me, all right? Just trust me on this one. What part of let it happen didn't you understand? That's it. That's it, come on. Attagirl. Are you outta your fucking mind? Now, you listen to me. Unconscious is a hell of a lot better than dead. A few seconds more and her spine would have snapped like a pencil, you got that? Now, shut up, and let me think, goddammit. Sera, I don't know what they've done to you, but if you're inside this thing, I need you to open the door. What the fuck is going on? Goddammit, Sera, open the door! I don't understand, Doctor. I need you to explain it to me. When? I don't know. Just before he left. That was, what, ten years ago? Dammit, John. How does it work? Sera's transponder generates a stabilized density matrix that sends a pulse over to John's, telling it to generate the same frequency. Because they share a confluent timeline, even from variable reference points, they both could draw into the same quantum subsystem. It's pretty, uh, groovy, huh? So you're saying that they arrived together. We set a radial distance of twelve and a half feet, so, yeah. I don't understand, why did it take so long to pick up his signal? She's been gone for more than 48 hours. But the transmissions were in phase, sir. It wasn't until the frequency dropped an amplitude that we even realized that there were two. I mean, it's been ten years, and to be honest, I wasn't even sure it was gonna work. Back engineering isn't an exact science, especially with technology this advanced. It's ironic, I know. Keep me posted. Goddammit, John. What the hell have you gotten yourself into? Sera, I don't know what they've done to you, but if you're inside this thing I need you to open the door. What do they want, Sera? Why are they here? It's obvious they need something from us otherwise we'd already be dead. What the fuck? Wallace! I wouldn't do that if I were you. You're only making it worse. Yeah? And who the fuck are you? My name's John. Well, John, when I want your opinion, I'll give it to ya! Yeah? Fuck. Fuck. Bugger. Shit! What the hell are these things? Perhaps you'd like to give me my opinion? It's an auto-response mechanism. So if you like the idea of spending the last few minutes of your life minus your extremities, by all means, keep doing what you're doing. - You what? - Of course, it all depends on how long it takes for you to bleed out, and my guess is you've got high blood pressure, not to mention all that straining. Anyway, its fine by me. You've barely been awake a minute and you're already giving me a headache. Who's the poofter? The name's Zack, asshole. Oh, is there a difference? So, where the fuck are we, lads? Don't look like no shovel and pick I've ever seen. Yeah, I'll bet you've seen a few. As a matter of fact I have. Busted out of half as many I've been in, pleased to say. Let's start again. My name is John. You are? Perry. What's the last thing you remember? I don't know. Pukin' my guts out I reckon. Guard! Did you bring the doc? Mr. Bulmer. You gotta help me, Doc. My guts feel rotten. Open your mouth, please, Mr. Bulmer. I was sick as well. Clearly a side effect of transport. Transport? What do you mean transport? It means this is some right fine magic. Right, magic. Hilarious. Roger that. Of the extra-terrestrial variety. Okay. Everyone who agrees with Dumbledore over here, raise your hand. Huh? Anyone? Anyone? Take a good look around. You find me one single thing that looks like something we could've built. You see, my old man was in tool and die for near 50 years. So I know machines. I know machines as well as I know thieving', boy. And believe me, I know thieving'. One man's magic is another man's genius, and I ain't never seen no genius like this. So... if it ain't built by man and you don't believe in magic, then something else must have built it. Come on, dude. What, you're saying we've been abducted by, like, aliens? Nah, nah, don't be daft. Pygmies. You fucking twat, of course, fucking aliens. Jesus Christ, I think the transporter's leaving brains behind. We've know about them for some time, but why they're here and what they want, I'm afraid that's still part of the mystery. Well, now, I knew there was more to you than meets the eye, Johnny boy. What? You think I was born orange? There was a time when certain organizations found my particular set of skills quite useful. I worked with lots of blokes like you, Johnny boy. If I was blind, I could smell ya. Hmm. So, what's your poison? CIA? NSA? FBI? Defense. So... how long they been doing this? Taking people? We believe a long time. My team allocated considerable resources into tracking bona fide abductees. Wasn't easy. People go missing all the time. Fuck. Shit, this is-- This is like Fire in the Sky! D.B. Sweeney? He got home okay. That's good, right? Though they did fuck him up first. That's not so good. We thought, if we could isolate commonalities, that might help us understand what we're dealing with... help us to stop it. Okay, so, what, we're talking, like, little green men here, right? They're not green. And they're definitely not little. No! Miss, it's incredibly important that you listen to me and remain calm. I can't. Miss, I know you're afraid, but if you do exactly as I say, we can get through this, do you understand? Good. Now, I want you to close your eyes. I'm claustrophobic! Miss, I need you to trust me, close your eyes. My name's John. What's yours? - Rhonda. - Rhonda, I want you to take a deep breath. And release it slowly, you understand? Good. That's good. No, no, no, please. - Rhonda. - Please let me out. Rhonda, love. Listen to me. I know what you're going through. Believe me, I do. I've spent a lot of years in cells not much bigger than myself, so I understand, all right? But you've got to calm down. We all want to get out of here alive, now, don't we? Yeah? You need to close your eyes and breathe. Come on, now, trust me on this one, love. All right. Now, I want you to imagine your most favorite place in the whole wide world. Maybe it's a real place, maybe it's not, maybe it's a little spot you got tucked away in the back of your mind. But either way, and this is the important thing, Rhonda, this place is yours and yours only. And when you're there, you're completely and utterly safe. No one and no thing can ever get ya. It's your safe place. Everything else just disappears. You got that place now? Good girl. Now, if you don't mind, I fancy carrying on talking. - Is that all right with you? - Mm. So what's a lovely girl like you do for a living, Rhonda? I'm-- I'm a teacher. - You don't say. - Mm. My mom was a primary school teacher in South East London. Fucking tough gig that, eh? - High school. - Oh, Jesus. You deserve a king's commendation for bravery for that, don't ya? What about yourself, love? You got any little'uns of your own? A little girl. Hannah. She's eight. Ah, that's a lovely age, innit? - They still need ya at eight? - Mm. My oldest is, uh, nineteen now. When the blokes start coming, it's a different story, innit? Anyway... in a couple of seconds, I'm going to ask you to open your eyes, all right, but you've got to be able to create a strong tether to that place in your mind. Because whatever happens here, you need to be able to get back there as quick as you can, you understand? All right. Go on then. Open your eyes. All right, keep looking at me, I'm right here. All right? There you go. All right, now, listen, I reckon we're a long way from home, but I promise you we are gonna get back. But you got to keep strong. Keep your wits about ya. Yeah, you think you can do that? Okay. Now, the first thing we need to figure out is what's the common denominator. Why us? Well, maybe we're just lucky. Rhonda, what's the last thing you remember? I-- I-- I don't know. I... No. Wait. I... I was on my way to work and I just dropped off Hannah at school, and I started to feel nauseous, and I felt this really horrible pain, then here. But how is that possible? Jacques! Jacques! Miss, listen to me. Miss! Jacques! We're all alone. Alex. What are these things? They're auto-responsive. I don't understand. What he's trying to say, love, is if you struggle, it'll rip your arms off. Subtle. Nice. Who the fuck are you? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Father Christmas, these are me elves. Oh, and that one there... He wants to be a dentist. Fuck you. I know you. Zack, you know this woman? Know her? How would I know her? She just said she knew you. Yeah, so what's your point? Oh, shit. You're Zack Chase. Zack, what's going on? Look, it's just the way it is, all right? Just because somebody says they know me, it doesn't mean they know me. Wait a minute. You have absolutely no idea who I am, do you? Uh, Zack Chase. Mossy Ledge? It's a band. Don't look at me, mate. Do I look like I do boy bands? It's a rock band, you shithead! You were a famous popstar when I was little. Rockstar, and what do you mean when you were little? You died. Okay, yeah, and you're obviously still high. I'm not fucking high! - Do I look dead to you? - Hey, get off my ass, I'm just saying what I know, okay? - When a big popstar... - Rockstar! ...gets murdered by his fiancée, uh, people talk about it! What the fuck are you talking about, murdered? It was all over the news. I was just a kid, but I remember my sister really loving your shit. Anyway, it was a big trial, your fiancée was found guilty and they put her in jail for life. Amber. She made up some bullshit story about you disappearing in a big flash of light. You had to be fucking crazy to think anyone is going to believe that shit. Anyway, they never found the body. Yeah, well, obviously there was no body. Alex, how long ago was this? I don't know, uh... Maybe fifteen years. - Cut the bullshit! - Alex, what year is it? Really? Alex, the year. 2018. See? What'd I tell ya? Out of her fucking mind. I'm not an idiot, asshole, I know what year it is. Here's a little tip. Lay off the scag. Oh, and Alice Cooper called, he wants his makeup back. What? Well, for starters, love, you're about thirty years out. What are you talking about? It's 2050, innit? Right. Okay, seriously, is everyone losing their minds? Why, what did I say? - It's 2001! - Bugger off. That's not possible, it's 1977. Okay. You guys, this isn't funny. John, c'mon, tell em' what year it is. 1969. Oh, and we're fucked. It's gonna get a lot worse Really? And just how could it get any worse than this? Fuck. Oh, fuck, it's worse. John. John! No! No! No! No! No! Shh. What is this? H-- How-- How is this possible? Safe place. What's it doing to her? Is she breathing in that thing? It's me. Gran? Woods. Rhonda. African. Female. Offspring, one. Slight abnormality in the right atria. You have functioned for 12,589 days. Soon, you will cease to function. You don't belong here. Whoever you are, please, I have to get home for my daughter, she'll be waiting for me. I'm afraid you won't be seeing Hannah again, dear. Please, I have to go home. I can't leave my little girl. No, please. I have to go home, she'll be waiting for me. Please, whoever you are, I'm begging you, please. Let me out. Goodbye. No, no, no, no. Please. Please. Sera, what do you see? People. What people? They're screaming. Sera, who's screaming? Everyone. Shut it down. Shut it down! Come on, Sera, stay with me. Stay with me! They're coming. Fuck me. What... the... fuck! What the fuck was that thing, Johnny boy? I honestly don't know. Alex, listen to me. Alex, look! Look around you! Look! It's fear. Fear? Yes. I think it's harnessing energy. I swear, I'll never do drugs again. Are you kidding? We get out of this, the first thing I'm gonna do, drugs! Lots and lots of drugs. Zack, remember when Rhonda first gained consciousness? Her claustrophobia put her in a completely different class of fear than the rest of us. The electrical activity behind her chair was enormous, but it waned when she hyperventilated and then stopped completely the moment she passed out. This last surge was most aggressive. When Rhonda was most afraid. And then just now, with Alex. I'm not afraid, okay? I'm just pissed. You hear that, motherfuckers, I'm just pissed! There it is. I'm on to you, dammit. That's not a coincidence. This whole time I assumed it was coming from the ship. It isn't. It's coming from us. So, what, you're saying we're, like, fuel? That's precisely what I'm saying. It wants us to be afraid. It needs us to be. We're feeding this son of a bitch. We're fucking fuel!? We knew they were harvesting us for a reason, we just didn't know what that reason was. Until now. Who are you? I work for the War Department. At least I did. Twenty-two years ago, we uncovered the remains of an unidentified flying object just outside of Roswell, New Mexico. I was called in ahead of the first response team. Fuck me, it's true. We managed to recover most of the craft, including the occupant, who died in the crash. We surmised early on that the E.T. had a technopathic link to his vessel. There was no throttle or steering mechanism that we could identify, and when we dissected the propulsion system we were unable to identify an energy source. You see, the creatures mind didn't just control the craft, it powered it. It was hardwired into the vessel. Somehow his species had discovered a way to convert thought into a viable form of kinetic energy. I was to learn later that Roswell wasn't the first. And it certainly wasn't the last. A similar crash had occurred in Pinos Altos a couple of years earlier. That discovery launched the most comprehensive research program ever undertaken by the U.S. government. Truth is, we didn't even know what we were looking for. But what we found... changed everything. There was widespread sporial contamination. Not just at the crash site, but throughout the surrounding area, including a local mining community. We tested everyone in the town, men, women, children. All under the hospices of possible contamination from a nearby chemical spill. Not a single person exhibited any signs of illness. No physical or psychological illness, no mutagenic effects, nothing. We detained them for as long as we could, a town that small, it's easy to raise suspicion. In the end, we had to let them go. All but one. Turned out one of the miner's wives was pregnant. A blood sample taken in utero revealed a hemoglobin abnormality we'd never seen before. The child was confiscated by order of the War Department and sent to Raven Rock for further testing. What's Raven Rock? It's a top-secret research facility. Like I said, mate, wasn't born orange. Was it a boy or a girl? It was a girl. What happened to her parents? We switched it out. With a baby whose mother had died in child birth. Her parents never knew. The hemoglobin abnormalities were only the beginning. Brain scans showed electrical activity so far off the charts they had to create new systems of measurement. Visual and spatial acuity were beyond anything we'd seen up to that point or since. When the child was 12 years old she manifested an extraordinary ability. We called it techlepathy. The ability of the human brain to interface with electrical based systems. No doubt a mutagenic response from sporial contamination. Of course, we didn't know half of what we know now. Reverse engineering their technology was slow and rather difficult. Later, the mutagenic response to the spores enabled the child to communicate with the vessel in the same way. What did she do? She opened the door. That was the term our team used for initializing the vessel. She only did it once. Never would have believed it if hadn't I seen it with my own eyes. But for a few seconds, she was in techlopathic communication with an alien technology. One that nearly killed her. What she saw... that's anyone's guess. She wouldn't talk about it. Apparently top brass felt I was too close to the project. Too emotionally invested, they said. They were probably right. Sera. Sera, I need you to tell me when you can see the door. I see it. Good. Sera, I need you to open it. Afraid. I know. I know, everything is going to be okay. - I promise. - Afraid. Sera, honey, listen, I need you to-- Jesus, John. She's not your goddamn daughter. She's a weapon. Our weapon. The only one we've got. Sera. Activate the vessel, Sera. The world is counting on us. Do you understand that, Sera? The world. Now, activate the goddamn machine! Again. Do it. - General. - Again. - That's enough. - Belay that order. General, look at her. God damn it, Allister, you're gonna kill her, that's enough. Go home. Don't come back until you have your priorities figured out. I'm sorry about what happened to your family, John. I am. But I've got a family too, we all do. And I'll be goddamned if I let those bastards take them away from us. I'm sorry. I was transferred to Washington shortly after. But I made a promise. I wasn't about to let them send a 12-year-old girl all alone into an alien vessel. A colleague of mine had reverse engineered the alien technology and so before I left we made certain of one thing. If Sera went, so would I. Do you have to leave? Yeah, I do. Will you come back and visit? I'm afraid it doesn't work like that. I don't want you to go. Hey, have I ever told you how blue whales communicate? Uh-uh. It's pretty amazing. They can actually send each other messages across the ocean. For real? Oh, yeah. And I'm not talking half the ocean, I'm talking the entire ocean. They send out this little frequency pulse that travels for thousands of miles. Anyway, the nanites in these transponders do kind of the same thing. Only they travel a lot further. How much further? Far enough that if anyone ever tries taking you away from here, they'll have to deal with me. And trust me, they don't want to deal with me. Promise? Promise. You go, I go. It's ready, sir. That was the last I saw her. Until now. Specialized Extraterrestrial Reconnaissance Agent. Sera for short. God knows what they've done to her. Still, she's here. Which means they know something I don't. They wouldn't have sent her up if they didn't think she could destroy this damn thing or work her way into its programming. Corrupt it. It's been our contingency since the beginning. We called it Project Ithaca. Maybe they just got desperate. Who knows what happened after you left. What I do know is, that pony there, Odysseus she ain't. So... we're all from different times. What year is it? It's impossible to say. We don't know if we've been lying here in stasis or if this ship exists in some kind of temporal anomaly. I think we have bigger problem. Oh, shit. Sera. Her burns are severe, John. All we can do now is watch her, see how she responds to the treatment. But she's a fighter, John. If anyone can pull through this, it's Elizabeth. Of course, you know that everything I'm saying is a lie. What? Elizabeth is gonna die, John. And even if there was some... miracle, she would wish, each and every day, that she had died. Because survival means the worst pain you could possibly imagine. Not to mention living without a face. Such a pretty girl. It's a damn shame. And it's all because of you, isn't it, John? Because you're a selfish, stubborn, son of a bitch. Maybe you wanted to stop at a motel. Do you remember? "John, stop, it's getting late," but, no, you had to drive, you had to keep going. The world according to Agent Brighton. Mr. Big Shot! Mr. Government Man. No. No. No. No. Well, now. Happy Christmas, love. And who the fuck might you be? Dad, it's me. It's Sammy. Really? Listen to me, you dumb cunt. I ain't your father, and you ain't my sweet pea. So if you're trying to get inside my fucking head, you can fuck off! I put that demon to rest a long time ago. If you really wanted to fuck me up, you'd have shown up as my ex-wife. Bulmer. Perry Carrol. You have functioned for 18,988 days. You are a primitive life form. Go fuck yourself! Fucking is irrelevant. Ah, see, that's your first problem, innit? Are we done now? Soon you will cease to function. Right then. Well, in that case, I might as well get some shut eye. Seeing as though I can actually lie down. Mm. Alex! John. You're not real. It's me, John. It's Sera. How? I isolated a channel in your pre-frontal cortex so we can communicate without them knowing. The sensation is odd, I know. What is this place? An echo. Why here? It's Rhonda's safe place. A powerful memory. Peaceful. I can see why she chose it. Now that she's gone, it's no longer important to them. They won't think to look for us here. I know what they want, John. But we don't have much time. What did they do to you? What they had to. General Borland wanted assurances that his plan to destroy the vessel wouldn't be uncovered by an alien technology capable of reading minds. Erasing my memory was the only way of ensuring I wouldn't be perceived as a threat. Once aboard, it was hoped that the sporial nanites would automatically interface with their corresponding technology and repair the damage. It was a calculated risk that seems to have worked. Even now I can feel my connection to the vessel growing stronger. What is it? A biomechanoid. Governed by a highly advanced artificial super intelligence. And the door? Ajar. You were right, John. They're harvesting energy. Why? They're protecting a digitized life form, suspended in an electrified, plasmic matrix. It requires a unique energy signature. Us. It's tapping our emotions as a food source. That's not all. Their secondary purpose is to harvest enough energy to open an interdimensional portal. They're transferring ships? Not only ships. Bodies. Their bodies. This ship was designed to create a stabilized density matrix allowing it to exist along multiple points in time. That explains things. But I don't understand, why would it do that, - the energy expenditure alone-- - They're looking for something. - What are they looking for? - Me. Sera, I don't understand, why are they looking for you? Something's wrong. Thought we could use a moment alone. She's a bad seed that one. You'd do well to stay away from her. What are you? Oh, Atticus. We are old. Tired. Tired of fighting, tired of traveling. Some of us just wanna go home. Isn't that what you want? What all of yous want? To go home? How do you know my name? Brighton, Atticus John. Oh, we know plenty about you. For instance, did you know that you've been functioning for 18,537 days, four minutes and ten, eleven, twelve... Well, you get the picture. You know, we seen all kinds, and in the grand ol' scheme of things, humans ain't nothin' special. Well, we don't mean that in no disparaging way, just is what it is. In fact, most yall ain't worth the sack of skin ya came in. But you, Atticus, you're different. We got our eyes on you. Yes, sir. We sure do. What is this? Why, Atticus, this is our moment. You see, some of us understand that sometimes you gotta break the rules. Sometimes for the greater good, you even gotta go up against your own kind. Help the helpless. In our case, that means helping you. Once activated... Ever since your wife and daughter died, you been chasin' forgiveness. Isn't that right, Atticus? Chased it all the way down to that there little girl. That's good. Sera needs you. And you need her. You go, I go. Now, there's a lovely proposition. But, you see, technology's a funny thing, Atticus. Imperfect machines made by imperfect men. All them scientists so pleased with themselves. That unbeknownst to y'all, a power surge goes and blows it all to hell. Your transponder failed, Atticus. Mm-hmm. Isn't fate just the damnest thing? You should know by now that struggling isn't in your best interests. You. You're talking? As are you. Like a normal person. We... We all thought you were, uh, you know, batshit crazy. - Batshit? - Crazy. I'm fully cognizant of our situation. What did they do to you? What they had to. - Did it hurt? - Yes. But it was necessary. I'm sorry. I... I wanted to say thank you. I was only 11 when it happened - and my mother, she-- - You're welcome. You know, I always fantasized about doing that. So is it true? What John said? That, uh, you can really speak to this thing? The nanites provide a stabilized neural interface, yes. So you can get us out of here? I don't know. I don't understand. I thought you just said that-- - They severed the link. - But... They sent you up here to help us, right? I mean, uh, isn't that why they sent you up here? Yes. I don't want to die, you know? I know I spent my whole bloody life trying, but I don't, not really. You're not going to die, Alex Gauthier. - You just said you can't. - Look at me. You're not going to die. Not here. Not in this thing. How do you know? I just do. Sera. John. Are you all right? Sera, they know about the transponder. Yes. What transponder? Then you know it shouldn't have worked. - What? - I saw it, Sera. My transponder was never calibrated. It was never initialized. What transponder? Jesus, mate. C'mon, just a couple of seconds. Shut your gob. It wasn't initialized. No, that's impossible. You go, I go, remember? There was an accident. Human error. They knew about you. About Ithaca. They knew about everything. So much for your Trojan Horse. Don't you see, Sera? They brought me here. They brought me here. Why? Back at Raven Rock, when you initialized the craft... what did you see? Death. Rhonda's death. - What? - Fuck me. You saw the future? In a manner of speaking. In a manner of speaking. You saw a woman's death 10 years before it happened, love. What other manner is there? And what about the rest of us? I didn't see anything else. Listen, if what Johnny boy says about you is true, then I think now would be a brilliant time to prove it. Yeah? So how about you do whatever it is you do, and, um, I don't know, get us the fuck outta here. I can't. They severed the interface. Um, slight problem. We're on a ship, right? In outer space. I mean, even if we get out of this, then... Then what, 'cause, you know, it's fucking space. Right. She does have a-- Beautiful, isn't it? Peaceful. Hard to believe all of those horrible things could be happening just a few feet away. Strapped down in those ghastly ol' things. But they are. Yes, Miss Sera, they most certainly are. What are you? Well, dear... I've always maintained that what we are isn't anywhere near as important as who we are. Stop what you're doing. Let us go. Oh, I couldn't do that even if I wanted to. Tell me, Miss Sera, how many people you reckon are aboard this vessel? Thousands. You can feel them, can't ya? All those souls, crying out, suffering. Just like your friends are suffering. I used to always wonder why you cared so much. You ain't never been treated well by nobody. Except John. You don't owe these people nothing. But I know you now, Miss Sera. Yes, ma'am. I sure do. Oh, we're coming on dreadful times, Miss Sera. Dreadful times. Of course, you already know that. Was it just some accident that your momma was infected by those spores that made you what you are? I don't rightly know, but I've been around a long time. A long time. Long enough to know that fate is one fickle bitch. Is that it? Is that all you fucking got? You fucking wankers! What the hell are you doing? Stop provoking them, man. Oh, sweetheart, I didn't know you cared. We've been going round and round and round with you, Miss Sera. A good many of us are just plain tired. We just wanna go home. You're not making any sense. Why are you here? Why, Miss Sera? To help ya. You got power in you. Real power. More than they care to admit. You make em' afraid. And they ain't used to being afraid. You can get out of here if you want to. Save your friends. Always could. Tell me how. Well, now, only you can answer that. All you have to ask yourself, Miss Sera, is what opens the door? No! You are different from the others. Like us. But not like us. Tell us... what are you? What... are... you. Leave her alone. You. You will die. They will die. Your entire species... will die. We'll fight. It'll make no difference. We might surprise you. You are... ordinary. Here I thought you knew everything about us. We're human beings, you murderous son of a bitch, we're anything but ordinary. The world is counting on us. If you're inside this thing, I need you to open the door. She only did it once. You got power in you. Sera. Sera, I need your help. Sera, what do you see? I see... you. So is it true? What John said? You can really speak to this thing? The nanites provide a stabilized neural interface. Yes. They sent you up here to help us, right? I mean, uh, isn't that why they sent you up here? Yes. We don't know if we've been lying here in stasis or if this ship exists in some kind of temporal anomaly. - It's 2050. - It's 2001! - It's 1977. - 1969. The ship is designed to create a stabilized density matrix, allowing it to exist among multiple points in time. Sera. What opens the door? We do. They're coming. Sera, what was that? What did I just see? You have everything you need to stop them. Sera, I don't understand. Goodbye, John. What? No. Sera, don't. You go, I go. Remember? You go, I go. It doesn't work like that. No, Sera, don't. You can't do this. Goddamn it, Sera, no! Goodbye. No! They've been taking us for years. They take us against our will. From our homes... and from our families. But there are those among us with the ability to fight back. To level the playing field. Until now, we were unknown to them. Until now, they thought we were helpless. We're not.
