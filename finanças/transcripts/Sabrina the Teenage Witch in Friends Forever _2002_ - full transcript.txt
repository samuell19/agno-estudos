Here's the deal. If you're anything like me-- and let's both hope you're not-- you've probably found yourself wondering, "hey, why can't i be this way "instead of that way? "Maybe i'd have more friends "if i were such and such "and not whatever. Maybe i'd be more popular, more accepted." My name's sabrina, and i'm a witch-- more or less, give or take. Sometimes i don't know what i am. I guess that's what this is about, basically. It's about not knowing... and finding out. This is where it starts-- right at the beginning. ♪ For she's a jolly good witchlette ♪ ♪ for she's a jolly good witchlette ♪ ♪ for she's a jolly good witchlette ♪ ♪ which nobody can deny ♪ sabrina! You're all so nice. Enjoy the party. Have some punch. Mingle. Where is it? Why isn't it here? Our little sabrina, 13 years old. So, we going to get to the gifts before she hits 14? It'll come, sweetheart. Be patient. Here, have some cake. Salem? I'm counting calories. Of course, those kind of calories don't count. Maybe it won't come. Maybe they know about me-- about what i am, about what i'm not. Every witch or warlock gets one on their 13th birthday. But i'm not like every witch. I'm different. I'm-- you're special, sabrina, and don't ever forget it. It's here! Uh, sabrina spellman? That's me. Uh, sign, please. It's here! It's here! Greetings, sabrina. I am enchantra, queen of the witches. It's a hologram. She can't see us. Show some respect. Like this? I've come to wish you a happy 13th birthday and welcome you to witchdom. And tell that pile of fur to show some respect, before i rip his tail off. Huh? Your wand is enclosed. Use it wisely, child. Oh, our little sabrina. My very own wand. I can't wait to use it. But you must--wait! Aah! Sabrina, dear, a witch uses magic wisely. Yeah. Ok, ok. Here goes. Aah! Sure. A little humor at the cat's expense. Ha ha. Ho ho. Good night, everybody. Good night, uncle eustace. Just think--monday... witch academy! I know you'll love it as much as we did. We're so proud of you. Uh-huh, yeah, proud, ditto. Very nice, but too red. Gimme that! Whatcha doing? Just reminiscing. Most outstanding student, class of 1643." "Hilda spellman, most outstanding, class of 1644." Remember the headmistress? Miss hag? Ha ha! Oh, how she loved us. And why not? We were outstanding. Don't forget me, winner of the magic amulet. Given to me by great grey tabby of west forest for wisdom and bravery. Yeah, whatever, salem. And, sabrina, we know you'll follow in our family tradition. Hey, sabrina, i know what you're thinking. "Both my aunts voted most outstanding... "will i measure up? Can i do it? Can i take the pressure?" That's not what i'm thinking. It's not? More like, "here i am, 13, going to the academy. What do i wear?" No, it's not that. No? How about-- what's gonna happen when they find out... i'm not all the witch i could be? Look at the star. I'm only half a witch. They'll know the minute they see i can't fly. Oh, hilda, look at the campus! It's as beautiful as ever. Such a wonderful atmosphere for learning. Hilda, hilda, hilda! There's miss stench! And miss fetid! And miss reek! It isn't so bad, is it? Everybody looks kinda... nice, huh? Greetings. Those shoes are not part of the uniform. Whoa! Who's the ugly brute? I beg your pardon? Uh, lovely beauty. Miss hag! You haven't changed a bit! You remember us? Hilda! Most outstanding student, 1643. And '44! Yes, i remember. You were the only students of '43 and '44. That was us. And this is our niece. Sabrina spellman, your next most outstanding student. Hello. Sabrina, eh? You're not like your aunts, are you? No, there's something different about you, isn't there? I, uh... look over there! Who is it? Quaint. If you'll excuse me... isn't miss hag something? You must be portia. It's such a privilege to have you here. I'm sure it is. Uhh! Excuse me! Hmph! You have to tell us-- where did you buy your clothes? Ha ha! All custom-made, of course. Wow. I'll never be like her. She's so... perfect, so popular, so together, so... so... so so-so. Oh, our little girl... off to witch academy. Study hard. Make us proud. Bye, salem. You're as good as any of 'em, if not better. That would be thumbs-up if i had thumbs. Hey, wait for me! I'm hungry! Good morning, witchlettes. Good morning, miss hag. In honor of our first day, we have a special visitation. You are all, of course, fine young witches. You are all gifted and skilled. You have spent years perfecting the witchly arts. You know many things... but you still have much to learn! And that, my dears, is why you are here. In the weeks to come, you shall learn the 3 principles of witchdom. A witch uses magic wisely. A witch is true to her friends. And a witch is true to herself. So it is written on the tree of wisdom. The what of which? The tree of wisdom in the witches' realm, where all truth and knowledge grows. Oh, that tree. These are but a few of the things you will learn at the academy. The best among you will be rewarded... with the golden wand. That is too cool! I wonder who's gonna get it. Well, portia, for sure. My family always gets the golden wand. It goes so nicely with my hair. But some of you will not excel. Some will not keep up. Some will fail to become true witches. I think you know who you are. I know i do. Hey, watch who's tail you're squishing! What?! Salem! What are you doing here? Uhh, i'm so glad to see you. Well, you've got a funny way of showing it. How many times must i tell you to watch the fur? Wait, whoa, hold. Correction-- not glad. Not glad to see you. You are not supposed to be here. You didn't think i'd let you go somewhere as cool as witch school alone, did you? Well, i gotta admit, i was starting to feel sort of lonely. Yeah, yeah, yeah. One question-- where's my picture? Mmm! Heh heh heh. Ooh. Don't do that! Give me that! Heh heh heh heh. I meant to do that. Clean that off right now! You're not gonna get me in trouble. And don't use your tongue. I don't want slobber on my wall. Tomorrow's my first day of classes, and i want to be rested and ready. No, no, no! Like so. Oh--oh--oh, dear. Oh, now, portia, um, bluebirds? Bree? Sabrina? Oh, right idea, wrong species. Oops. Let me try again. I know i-- no! Will you lose the fish? Oh, my, my, my. Give me one more chance. I can do it. You'll see. Very well, dear. But let's do try for a bird this time, eh? Oh, well, that's different, sabrina. Very, uh, different. Salem, you promised! A cat's gotta eat. Uhh! Frog in the throat. Whew! Saved by the bell. Spell of energy, spell of wisdom, spell of transmogrification. Spell it? I can't even say it. Sabrina, spell of courage! Uh, um... quant-quantum, um... quantum indignito-o-- oh, drat! Nicole. "Quanto, indignatious, "dermina meritorium, ut dunque honorarius." Hmm. Very good, child. What a show-off. The relocation of an object from one point to another. Let's see... portia, demonstrate! Up and across! Good work, dear. Naturally. Britney, full circle! Hey, i'm-- ohh! Uhh! Uhh! Oh, it's a start. I'm so sorry, sabrina. That was so totally embarrassing. Oh, you'll get it. Is that whispering i hear? Sabrina, up, around, and across! Here goes nothing. What's her problem? Maybe she's not all the witch she could be. Let us all remember-- this is a witch academy, and we are all here to learn. Don't worry, we'll both get it. Thanks, britney. You stay here, or i'll call zelda to come and get you right now! Yeah, right, sure. And that headmistress? Bad as she looks? Who's the one with the hair? Her, i could do without. You know, salem, this isn't easy. I don't need you giving me more grief. Oof! Ptoo! Ptoo! Brina! You just made magic! Did i? I did? I did! My wittle baby's all gwowed up. Don't want to be late for cauldron class. Oh. Do not leave this room. Sure. If you need me, i'll be here... starving. Eh. Beggars can't be choosers. Hi. Sabrina, over here! Who, me? Come on! Hmmph. Eye of newt and sumac vine, mugwort, henbane, tamarind. What are the next ingredients? Nicole? The bookworm's gonna know. Touch of nettle, vitriol, serpent's egg, pennyroyal... and? Mantis leg? W-w-what was that? You didn't say "mantis leg," did you? Nicole! Nicole, watch out! Aah! Eww! Eww! You can do a better job ironing that blouse, my dear. Everyone is to look her best always. I'm going to take a wild guess and say... sabrina! Don't just stand there! Do something! Try your wand. I don't know where it is. Ah, very good, uh... i could've done it myself. I was only trying to-- i don't need your help! Could she be any weirder? It's no use. You are now learning the first principle of witchdom. Ohh! Magic must always, always be used wisely. In the weeks and months to come, you will learn the other principles. A witch is true to her friends. A witch is true to herself. When you have learned these things, you will truly be all the witch which you can be. Uhh! Watch where you're tossing that. I really miss home. And zelda and hilda. It's so hard here. Not just the classes, but the girls. I'm trying to make friends, i really am, but hard as i try... i guess it's 'cause i'm not like them. I'm only half a-- sabrina, are you that worried what those other girls think? I don't know... maybe... not really. Sabrina! She'll see you! What'll she think? Quick, hide! Sabrina? Eee! Oh, a stuffed kitty. He's so old and worn. You must've had him since forever! Yeah, heh, gotta be kinda careful. He's ready to fall apart. So, what's doin', brit? I just came to invite you over to portia's room. We're having a slumber party. Wanna come? Me? Are you sure? Sure, i'm sure. Yeah, ok. I'd love to. I wasn't like that when i was a teenager. Of course, things were different 400 years ago. Sabrina, come in. Come on up and try my sparkle braids. Oh, uh, yeah. Hey, just washed my hair, and i can't do a thing with it. Oh, come on up here! Look at you walking around like a half-witch! Uh, i'm a little stiff, that's all... from that accident on the broomstick. Oh, that was too funny. Yeah, hysterical. I'll stay down here where it's soft. I saw that nicole talking to you. So, is she weird, or what? And so unfriendly. There's something bogus about her for sure. Let's fix your hair. Ooh! Wow! Cool, brina! Ha ha! Look at this. "Chapter 13-- love potions." "How to make your fairy tale come true." Should we mix up a batch of that for nicole? Can you picture her dancing at the ball with a prince? Ha ha ha ha! Skating like a princess in a frozen wonderland! Swimming through the sea-- ha ha ha-- like a mermaid. Ha ha ha! "Potions to gain full witch powers." Now, that's what the weirdo needs. Yeah, right. Heh. Yes, yes, good, good. "Potions to gain full witch powers." "Heart of palm, butterfly dreams, morning dew, 2 drops." Uh-oh! Something's wrong! You need quicksilver. Ix-nay on the ess-may. Quicksilver. It's all right now. Mm-hmm. Good, good. Thank you, nicole. They always have the antidote on the next page. Brina, hurry! We'll be late for lunch! Spider smoothies today. Ok! Then let's go. I can't believe that nicole girl was talking to you again. You know what i think? I think she's a half-witch. No! In our school? No, no, no. No way. Uh-uh. It couldn't be. Not a chance. She's always reading, like it doesn't come natural. I bet if you looked at her hand, you'd see a half-star. Can you imagine? A half-witch... right in our class? Eww! Yeah. Eww. Sabrina? Sabrina, are you coming? Uh, yeah, i'm coming. Come in. Hi. Um, nicole? I need to talk to you. Hey, sure. Well, it-- it's about me-- something about me, you see, and, uh, it's, well, me. You're a half-witch. Shh! Hush! Shh! No one can hear. I'm the last room on the hall. Anyway, what's the big deal? I'm a half-witch, too. There's worse things to be. No, there's not! If the girls find out-- oh, promise not to tell. That's why you came? To make sure i'd keep my lips zipped? I won't jeopardize your friendships. Thanks, nicole. You're the best. You care so much what they think. They're my friends. They'd never accept me if they knew. You know, nicole, you could be their friend, too. Heh heh. I don't think so. Sure. They're fun. All you need is a little, well, uh, fixing up. You really think? I don't think. I know. ♪ Da da da da na ♪ ♪ da da da da na ♪ ♪ da da da ♪ ♪ ooh ooh ooh, sabrina ♪ ♪ da da da da na ♪ ♪ da da da da na ♪ ♪ da da da ♪ ♪ ooh ooh ooh ♪ ok, now all you have to work on is attitude. You know, the whole witchy kind of thing. Sort of, um, bubbly-- like this. I don't really have to toss my hair, do i? Just try it. Hi! Uh, you almost had it. More like, hi! Hi. Oh, hi! Hi, you! Bravo. I think she has it. So i said to miss stench, there is no way i can do my homework and my hair all in one night. Hey, girls. Hi! Uh, nicole and i have been practicing zaps. High! And low! What's say we go sit in that tree over there? Well, come on. I told you this was a bad idea. What's the matter? You can fly, can't you? No. I mean, yes. I mean, i-- of course you can. Unless you're just half a witch. Well, well, well. ♪ Nicole is a half-witch ♪ ♪ ...is a half-witch ♪ miss hag? Yes, miss stench? It's about nicole. What about her? She's a half-witch. I know. Is there a problem? Well, i'm afraid the other girls have found out, and you know how they can be. Hmm... salem, how can you sleep at a time like this? 3:00 in the morning? Oh, i don't know-- comes kind of natural. They're torturing her. It's not right, and it's all my fault. They never would have found out if i hadn't made her fit in. She was happy keeping to herself. What to do or how to help her. One question-- who are we talking about? Nicole! Oh, right, right, of course. Ooh. Tsk, tsk, tut, tut. Pity, pity. Now could we go back to sleep? Salem, you are not helping! What do i know? I'm a cat, not the tree of wisdom. There has to be something i can do, something i can-- what did you say? Tsk, tsk, tut, tut, pity, pity. Back to sleep? Thank you. Hey, glad i could help, whatever i did. I really, really, totally apologize. You kept my secret through it all, and you're a completely honorable person. And what's more, i know how to fix things. You tried fixing things once before. This time we go to the tree of wisdom. What?! Even i'm not that crazy. All of our problems come from being half-witches. There's got to be a way to make us whole. The tree of wisdom will know the answer. But the witches' realm is totally out of bounds. We sneak in tonight after the lights go out. Nobody will know we're gone. But we're half-witches, which means half-mortals, and mortals are forbidden in the realm. Nicole, this will fix everything. I know it will. You think? Really? I know. We can do it together. Ok--friend? Ok. Friend. I never had one of those before. One of what? A friend. Now, how do we get to this forbidden place? Well, that is a tiny problem. I'm sure i saw a book. Not this one or this one... what about this one? That's it! Directions to the realm of witches. Oh, brother, not that way-- that way. There's the gate! If we can get that far, i know we can get in. How hard could it be? But how do we get from here to there? Hmm... well, we could... try this. "The incantation for passage to the realm-- "mutatitis grandis ut." Is this it? If it isn't, it ought to be. Pass. How are we gonna get in without a pass? Cauldron delivery. We did it! We're here! And we're polka-dotted. Ew! What was in those cauldrons? Who cares? We are in! Yeah... but what are we in? Warts! Warts installed! 2 for one--today only! Wrinkle cream! Adds wrinkles instantly! No, thank you. You look like a nice girl-- loving, caring, and friendly. Oh, um, well-- i can fix that. Not so fast, my pretty. Jar of heartlessness, just for you-- guaranteed to turn you selfish, mean, and uncaring. Um, thanks, but, uh, no thanks. Get your delicious apples-- golden red. The last apple i had didn't agree with me. Let's get going. Potion palace, unfair to newts! Potion palace, unfair to newts! Union now, union forever! Have you ever been any place like this? There is no place like this. How will we find the tree of wisdom? I don't know. It could be anywhere. Look! Hello! Anybody home? Hello! Excuse me, tree of wisdom? Hello? Anybody there? Guess we're barking up the wrong tree. And we can't find it for the forest. Looking for something, dearies? The tree of wisdom. Do you know how to get there? A magic portal can get you anywhere. Care to try one? But which? That's for you to discover. What have we got to lose? That's what i'm afraid of. Wrong door? Wrong door. Yikes! Whoa! This is pretty cool. But how do we get out of here? That was close. Ow! Ok, buster! Aah! That was close. Wanna try another? You pick. Yes? What is it? I'm quite busy, as you can see. Ouch! Oh--oh, yes! Well, i'm sorry, i'll--i'll go. Uh, just wanted to mention 2 girls are missing, that's all. What?! Oh, um, you're busy. I'll come back. What did you say? I was just doing the bed check, you see, and, well, 2 were empty-- the beds, that is. Except one had a fur sort of thing, sort of snoring. What? How? Well, sort of like a... not that-- the girls. Where are they? Oh, them. Well, they're gone. Uh-oh. Yeah! Hey, watch it, buster! Um, nicole? Yeah? Nicole, look. Shh. Phew. Well... let's do it. How? Who? Well, sabrina, i'd say, and nicole, i guess. Where did they go? Well, i found this, and it was open to this. A map? There-- they went there. Not the witches' realm. You got it, sister. But sabrina, nicole-- they're just students. W-well, yes, they certainly are. Who knows what might happen to them in the witches' realm? G-g-get me the phone. Cool! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! More to your left! No, no, your other left! I'm surrounded by incompetents. What is it?! Oh, that tickles. Quiet, will you?! I'm so sorry to bother you on a weekend, your awful highness. Get to the point, miss hag. Well, funny thing-- ha ha-- you're going to have to laugh. It seems 2 of our students have, uh-- have what?! Left the academy and entered the realm of the witches and-- what?! She took that well. She lost them?! That fool! She can't even control a couple of 13-year-old half-witches. Tsk, tsk. Don't those children understand what this means? Oh, yeah, it's a shame, but, uh-- it simply isn't safe for half-trained students to be in the realm. Both, straining: yeah. Speaking of safety and such-- i can't hear myself think. Yes, of course. I have that problem, too. Come here, you fools. And put down that rock! They went through the magic portals! Typical. Stop lying down on the job and get them out of there quickly! Then bring them to me! Love to. Useless! Aah! Go! I want them here within the hour! Ow! Ow! And find another rock to replace the one you broke. Nicole, i'm all for dancing with princes, we ought to be looking for the tree? Mind if we cut in? Half-witches around, have you? About your height, your age? Hey, sorry--midnight. That's when i turn into a frog. That was the last door. And no tree of wisdom. If we're gonna be back by breakfast. Do you-- do you see anything? Lots of trees, b-b-but none of 'em look too w-wise. Just an old owl-- nothing to be scared of. And that? Only a crow-- nothing to be scared of. Th-that was something to be scared of. Is it coming? We're ok now. Do you really think so? Do you really think we're ok? 'Cause i'm thinking maybe i was wrong. I know it was my idea to come here, but maybe it wasn't such a good idea. We should have stayed back there and faced our problems. 'Cause when i brought us out here, i got us in over our heads. Yeah. I'd have to say you did! Quicksand! We gotta work some magic and get ourselves out of here. We're half-witches, sabrina. What are we gonna do? The vine! Concentrate! Together, nicole! Just a little more, nicole. We did it! Whoo! I can't believe it! We're safe. We're all right. Yeah, but i kinda wish we had a shower. Next time, be more specific. Come on, we gotta find that tree. If only we had some sort of sign. "Tree of wisdom, 500 feet." What are we waiting for? Let's go! "Tree of wisdom"-- straight ahead. "You're almost there." One wish per person. No mortals. All transactions final. Next! I didn't know the tree was so popular. Come on, come on, the tree doesn't have all day. Next. Name. Sabrina spellman. Nicole candler. Sabrina spellman? Salem's sabrina? Uh, yeah. Hey, flat-ears, get your tail over here. It's salem's housemaid. Housemaid? Saley told us all about you. How you wait on him hand and foot, obey his every command. He told you that, did he? Next! Oh, w-what do we do? I don't kn-know. State your wish. Uh, hiya. Um, uh, yeah, hi. Well, hurry it up, will you? I got leaf blight here, and it's itchy. Oh, is it itchy! Wanna help me out with a little teensy scratch? I guess. Ok. Here? Oh, that's nice. Ah, that's nice. Thank you, thank you, thank you. So, what can i do for you girls? Well, it's like this. We, uh-- my friend and i-- spit it out! Well, let's say we have these friends, right? Right, a couple of friends with a little problem. That's it. They're sorta half-witches and-- half-witches? Do they know their witchcraft? Uh, sure. If they want to get out of the realm... alive. We better go. And fast. Stop right there! Y-yes, sir. Come back here. I know who the half-witches are. You do? The half-witches are... you. Yes. I got 3 out of 9 lives left. I'm not throwing away any more. I only got 2! Good help is hard to find. So, what's the big deal about being a half-witch? I got a cousin's half-beech. Got another's half-oak. Well, as long as we're confessing, i'm part pigeon, myself. W-we were wondering if you could... if you could make us whole. Hmm. You sure about that? You don't wanna be a half anymore? You're 2 halves who want to be a whole? Exactly. All right, if you're sure you're sure. Stand back a little-- right there. "Quod era dimidius, nunc sum universus." What once was half, let now be whole! I'm--i'm whole! Nicole? Nicole? Nicole? Wh-wh-what happened? Two halves make one whole. You became a whole witch, leaving her mortal, and as you know, there can't be no mortals in the witches' realm. Turn her back! Fix her! Please! No exchanges, no refunds. All spells final. Why didn't you tell us? Why didn't you stop us? True wisdom cannot be told, only earned. I'll change her back myself. I'm a full witch now. You'll need more magic than that! Only a magic amulet can overturn a wisdom spell. A magic amulet? Where do i get a... salem! There she is! Oh, no, no, no! I'm a whole witch, aren't i? Idiot! Fool! Uhh! Little miss half-witch flew the coop. Guess she couldn't take the pressure. Aww, poor thing. Well, no way she was ever going to be accepted here anyways. The only one who's unacceptable is you, portia. Ohh, that really scares me. Ha ha! Then how about this? Hey! Or this? Or this? Put me down! Put me down! Ok. My ha-a-a-air! Hey, take it easy, portia. Uhh! What's wrong with her? She could just zap it back. Oh, i don't know. Maybe she just not all the witch she could be. Salem! Nicole was turned to stone, and it was all because of me. Sabrina. And you know why? Because all i cared about was what those horrible, awful girls thought. I wanted them to like me. Sabrina-- to accept me! Sabrina! I'm trying to tell you-- i know! You do? Why didn't you say so? Spike and flat-ears told me. They said my amulet... would save her! Oh, salem, thank you! You don't know how much this means. This whole thing was my fault, and-- all right, let's not start that again. We gotta get going. Excuse me. Sorry. Closed for the night. Come back first thing tomorrow, 13 o'clock. I'm not here for wishes. I'm-- she's gone! I'm-- they took her. Who? Who took nicole? And... i've got to-- save it, honey. Enchantra's castle. Then that's where we're going. You can always find a new friend. Salem! Just kidding. Boy, this is some castle. Ah-ah-choo! You hear that? Uh, you're imagining things. I got a horrible allergy to bats. Think. How can we get in? There's gotta be a way. Nobody's getting in or out of there except for those... ugh, those bats. That's it! What's it? I'm a whole witch now. I'll transform us. Not into-- bats. Sorry. Do you have any idea how embarrassing this is for a cat? One more try. I'm sure i can get it. Forget it! I'm outta here! What if you make us into liver bits? Salem, we have to rescue nicole. Please? Ok, ok. Oh... go! Of all the things we could've been... ah-choo! Why'd it have to be bats? Ah-choo! We have liftoff! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-choo! Uhh! Uhh! Aah! Ohh! After them! I'll sound the alarm! You sounded it last time. It's my turn! Is not! Is too! Is not! Is too! Is too! Is not! Uh, they're not here. Come on! Hold on. What do you bet they're hiding in here? They always hide in armor. Ooh, good thinkin'. You know, you're gonna have to pay for this. Me? It was your idea. Was not! Was too! Wasn't! Was! See? I told you we shouldn't go for the obvious. Only one thing-- i'm allergic to caterpillars! Ah-ah-choo! Come on! Salem, we're trapped... like rats! Speak for yourself. Mama! Whoa-oh-oh! Hey! Uh, craven, i'm stuck! You go, girl. Thanks. Whoa! Aah! Get outta the way! I ca-a-a-an't! This is all your fault! Is not! Is too! Is not! Uhh! Oh, no! Nicole! Over there! I see them! I saw them first! The amulet! Salem, i need the amulet! Aah! Aah! Wait. Please, let it work. Yaah! It didn't work. Oh, man, am i gonna get that spike. I paid 20 bucks for this, and nothing, nada, zilch! You bought it?! Is he gonna get a piece of my fur! Good thing i wrote him a bad check. It's a fake? The whole thing? The award? The great grey tabby of the-- none of it is real? Well, not in so many words. Oh, what have i done? I'm so sorry. Nicole, you were the best friend i ever had! And i lost you because i wanted to be a full witch. I wanted to be accepted. And look what it got me. Well, i don't want the powers! I don't want to be a witch! I'll turn myself to stone. Sabrina! Sto-o-o-op! There is another way. Nicole? Wow. That was the strangest thing. Sabrina? Nicole! You're back! It's you! Nicole! Your star-- it's still half. And yours, too! Isn't it great? What happened? I feel awful stiff. Hey, long story. First you were stone, then you weren't. Enchantra reversed the spell. But how? Why? Why? Because you learned a very valuable thing, one which some witches never learn. You learned the 3 principles a witch uses magic wisely, a witch... is true to her friends. And a witch... is true to herself. And honestly, some of the girls around here never figure that out. At least, not truly. They never understand it deep inside. But you do. My young friends, you have something far more powerful than mere magic. We do? Like what? A friendship strong enough to last forever. And whether witch or not, that's a thing most anyone would love to have. Friends? Forever. What can i say? I'm a very emotional cat. Oh, brother! Did you ever think we'd make it here? Not for a second. I'm so proud, i could bust wide open. You know what a mess it makes. And the golden wand-- for being all a witch can be and more-- goes to... sabrina spellman! Me? Did i hear wrong? Did i hear her not say my name? Sit down, portia! Well? Go on. Atta girl, brina! Thank you, ma'am. Some of us treated one of our classmates very poorly. We refused to accept her because she was a half-witch. But there's no shame in that, and i ought to know because... i'm a half-witch, too, and proud of it! I'm proud and honored to be witch and mortal. That's why i want to share this with someone who earned it as much as me-- nicole candler! What? Oh, my! Hilda! Brina! Brina! Brina! You da one! You da one! Do the wave! Do the wave! Yesss! Sabrina! Yay! Go, sabrina! Yay! Whoo! That's it. That's how i found out who i was and who i wasn't. That's how it happened for me. Maybe something like it has happened to you, if you're anything like me. And let's both hope you're not.
