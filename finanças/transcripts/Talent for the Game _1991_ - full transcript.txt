You know we all appreciate this, Mr. Sweet. Virgil. Working the hours we do, wasn't any other way. Management isn't gonna give us any time off. Not for something like this. I hope he's good. You aren't claustrophobic, are you? Well, I've been having a reoccurring dream about being buried alive, but other than that, I'm okay. Lester, this is Virgil Sweet. Glad to meet you, son. How you doing? A little nervous, I guess. Not as nervous as I am, son. I don't know how you guys live down here. You must be part mole. Right? You get used to it. Not me, kid. Not me. I could never get used to it. You ready, kid? Yep. Start walking. Real nice. Okay. Put some heat on it, son. Control it, kid. Control it. Give me all you got, son. All right, kid. That's enough. Good job. You did good, kid. Real good. Thank you, sir. You got the good breaking stuff, son, but your fastball is a little short. Do I have what it takes? Maybe. It all depends on how hard you work on your mechanics, son. "Maybe" ain't no kind of answer. "Maybe" is powerful stuff, son. The road to heaven's paved with "maybes." Look, you got a dream. You hold on to it. Everybody needs a dream. Hello, gentlemen. How are you? Hi, Virgil. Virgil. Virgil, how you doing? Hey, Cal, how are you? Nice to see you, Virg. Great jacket. The circus is in town, right? How you doing, Virg? Pretty good, Ray. How are you? Strike one! I heard about a kid in Boise. He's never been struck out. Rumors. He ain't it. He ain't it? He ain't it. Ain't what? The phenom. What's that? The player that just rises perfect right out of the earth. He don't have to learn like you and me. He's born to play. Every guy out here, I'll swear to you, even though they won't admit it, every scout that's out here right now, is looking for him. That's our dream. That's why we haul ourselves all around the country, going from town to town. Do you think this guy really exists? He exists, all right. Hard part's finding him. Gentlemen. How you doing? Nice of you to make it. You too, Virgil. Very good, Frank. Very quick. The junk man has arrived. Virg here is a great teller of tales, kid. Now, there are two sports in which a man has got to be able to tell tall tales. Baseball and fishing. You see before you, kid, is the last of a dying breed. The guy actually believes in magic. He won't even use a radar gun. Now why is that, Virgil? It releases very dangerous radio vibrations, Frank. It makes you wear very weird clothes. Ball. I take that about 82 miles an hour. How about you, Frankie? I'll be damned. Eighty-two exactly. Better watch where you stick that. You'll tweak your tweeter, buddy. You'll warp your fungo. You're gonna back up your plumbing. Definitely. Okay, that's it. It won't back up my plumbing. Strike two! You did all of the troubleshooting stuff? I checked everything. - California Angels. - Bobbie Henderson's office. Yes, operator. I'll accept the charges. I got your number from an outhouse wall. Somebody who got your number from an outhouse wall. I told you to stop doing that, didn't I? Troubleshooting, troubleshooting. Try that. Hello? Weaver sent me a telegram. He says, he wants me in LA day after tomorrow. How come you're the only guy who calls collect from the field? Do you have any idea what he wants? You know Weaver. He always plays his cards close to his vest. Yeah. Would you take me away from all of this? Wilson. Got all he's going to have. Couple years, strain's gonna shoot right up the arm. Let somebody else pay for the sling. Pass. Kerriker. He's got a seven curve, but his heater is a foot and a half short and he ain't getting any stronger. Pass-adena. It's the bottom of the ninth, two outs, one man left on base. And who's coming up to bat? Trouble. Trouble focuses in, sets his feet... Licks them a little bit. Ladies and gentlemen, the tension mounts. Here's his 0-and-0 pitch. First pitch... Swung on and missed. Strike one. Pitcher winds up. Here's the 0-and-1 pitch. Ha! After 63 days, honey, welcome home. Ahhh! Woo! Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry. I didn't mean it. It's freezing. I know. Why did you do that? Because I absolutely wanted to do it. It's funny. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Come on. No, no. Ah... Aw, shit, Virgil. I forgot. You okay? Gotcha. You okay? Yeah. Hi, Nicky. How are you? Hi, Virgil. How are you? You been good? Great. Good to see you. Ba-boom! How are you? How you doing? How's it going? Wonderful, where's Bobbie? She's in the powder room, hiding. Oh, wait, look. I've been practicing. Watch. Get out of here. You need more practicing. Hello, Steve. Hi, Virgil. Ha, ha! Hey, watch this. Safe! You're looking good, Timmy. Come here, you! Hot dogs. I own your ass. You wish you were with me, don't you? I miss you, Virg. Not too much? No, not too much. Don't change on me, man. A lot of water under the bridge since '71. Christ, you were getting good. If that son of a bitch hadn't hit you... Hey, that's hardball, man. Come on. What am I doing here? All right, this is for your ears only. Nobody on the floor knows yet. This team has been sold. This one? Right. Wow. Who bought it? Gil Lawrence, the advertising guy. Yeah, Linda. Comprehensive farm system report. You got it there? On Lawrence's desk by noon, all right? Right. Noon! Man, does he know anything about baseball? He's got a billion dollars, beau. He doesn't have to know anything. That's dumb. Dumb? Yeah. A billion dollars is dumb? Virgil, we got to talk. No, man, that's not what I'm talking about. But, yeah, let's talk. Well, the man's got his own ideas. He's going to take a broom to the whole front office. For a while, I didn't even know if I was gonna get the ax. But somehow you survived, huh? That's good, kid. Lawrence isn't happy with the scouting program. He thinks it's too expensive. Thinks we don't need guys in the field anymore. You're kidding. We're going with the bureau's scouting reports. We'll get comprehensive statistics on every eligible player out there. You're not kidding. How much time do I got? I can stall for a little while. What kind of an answer is that, Tim? I don't know. Virgil, baseball is changing. It's a business. It's profit and loss. Yeah, there never was any security in scouting. You're goddamn right. What about coaching? I always thought, maybe, you know... Lawrence wouldn't buy it. Convince him. You're good at that. Virgil... He's got no reason to promote you. Have you got one single good prospect I can throw at him? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Got a kid, a sleeper. He's great. If he's ready, do I got a job? Well, it can't hurt. Can't wait any longer, Riggs. I got to see the kid now. He can't pitch in the damn rain. I got an idea. All right, Riggs. Give him a dry ball. Tommy, I want you to give me your best fastball. Just turn it loose. Show me some magic, kid. Give him another one. Let it go, son. Just let it go. One more. Let it go, son. Let it all go. Come on. That's it, son. So? He's not fast enough. Not yet. Work hard, kid. See you next spring. This must be Virgil Sweet. It ain't working, Bobbie. I'm coming up with zero. Hey, you'll think of something. I don't know. I just don't know. I'm running out of time. Why don't I come out and see you this weekend? Ahhh! No! Mmm. Where am I, Sweet? God's country, honey. And you're looking beautiful. You're not so bad yourself. However, I must say, your ride is an automotive slum. Look at this. I just had it cleaned. The outside. The inside hasn't been touched. I'm hungry. Where are you taking me, Sweet? Pocatello, honey. Pocatello. No! Watch the road. Ahhh! We're going to go see some long-ball hitters. Shit! What? It's dead. It's dying like everything else in this car. It's too old. God! We're overheating. Must be the fan belt. Oh, man. And we're in the middle of no place. I got it. It's not the fan belt. It's not? It's the water pump. Do you have a water pump? Well... Sweet. You got two choices. We can either sit here and sweat or we can start to walk. We could dance. What? We could dance. We're out of seeds. You know what, Sweet? Huh? I always knew exactly where I was going with my life. I always knew what I wanted. And then... Then one day you walked into my office and you introduced yourself. I knew I was in trouble. I mean, I never knew anybody could look so battered and be so damn attractive at the same time. I love you, Sweet. Come on. Git.Wait. Stop. Ah, shit. Ah, this is stupid. What's the matter, your back hurts? No. You got a mind. Hell, you got a master's degree in psychology. I got nothing. I'm a scout. Pretty soon, I won't even have a job. I haven't got an ounce of security. Aw, it's boring already. You're starting to piss me off, Sweet. Wait a minute. This is what I'm trying to tell you. You don't get it. You just don't get it. I know you're not getting it. Get what, all right? I don't need that kind of security. I have that kind of security. Look, I love the fact that you're a scout and you do what you want to do. Don't you see that? Aw, Sweet, I believe everything happens for a reason. I mean, that's why we're out here getting sunstroke because this is exactly where we're supposed to be. Okay? You don't really believe that garbage, do you? You know what your problem is? You got your head so far up your ass feeling sorry for yourself... That you can't see that everything you need is standing right here in front of you. You're such an asshole, Sweet. Bobbie! It doesn't fit! Keep trying. Baseball. Yeah. Ho, ho, ho! You can do it! Throw it in there, kid! Strike! Strike! You're out! Strike! One more, Sammy! Strike! Ow! You're out! Game's over! You all right? In this town because we're supposed to be. Is that what you said? You're lucky it's my left hand. I got a date tonight. Way to go, man. Good game. Good job! How's the hand, son? It hurts. Better ice it. Listen, my car broke down up the street a ways. Do you know where there's a pay phone I can use? Sure. There's one over at the grocery store across the road. Thanks. My name's Virgil Sweet. Toby Curry. Glad to meet you, Toby. Who's your pitcher? Sammy Bodeen. Man, he's really good. He's better than that. Hi, Sammy. Hi.Virgil Sweet. Hi. Nice to meet you. It's a pleasure meeting you. You got a great arm, son. Thank you. Listen, I used to catch pro a few years back. You caught pro? Yeah. I'd love to catch you, son. Sure. Tobe, give him the mitt. One's a fastball? Yeah. Two's a curve. Three's a split-finger. Thank you, son. Can I borrow your mask? Sure. Thank you. Come on, son. Thank you. Sure, Sammy. You throw that way to him, but you burn my hand off. You holding back, son? Let her rip. Let it go. Argh! You all right, mister? You okay? Yes! Does it hurt? Yes. Son, I'm a professional scout for the California Angels. He's a scout for the Angels? Yes. They're not doing too good this year. Well... I think Sammy's been wasting your time here, Mr. Sweet. I'm sorry about that. Mr. Bodeen, I don't think Sammy's been wasting our time. Dad! Customer here. I'll be right back. Hi. I need some fuel and I need to check the batteries and hydraulics. Oh, sure. We can do that. How's Ann, Frieda? Real good. Tell her hi. Mr. Bodeen, I was... I think I can make this easy for you, Mr. Sweet. I'm the minister of the Genesee Community Church right here in town. That's it right over there. Do you see? And my daddy was also a minister to that church, and his daddy before him, and that's the way it's always been. And I hope to goodness nothing ever happens to change that. But Samuel's the only one that can follow me into the pulpit, so he's pretty well got his future mapped out for him, and that doesn't leave too much room for baseball. I don't want you to get me wrong. I got nothing against baseball. I think it's a wonderful sport. I really do. It helps build character and all that stuff, but it's just a game. I think you should really hear this. This is about your son. Is there something wrong? No, not at all. Not at all. What is it that confuses you? Well I'm not gonna stand here and try to pull your leg and tell you that I know your business. Because I don't. The only thing I know is baseball. I've lived it all my life. A shortstop told me a couple years ago that his family came from Greece, and in old Greek, the word "sin" meant missing the mark. I guess you must have a point to that. When somebody has a God-given gift like Sammy and he doesn't use it, I think that's kind of like missing the mark, don't you? I feel really bad for that kid. What are you going to do? I don't know. We could kidnap him. That's an idea. I'm only joking. I just find it difficult to leave him here. How good is my son? Mrs. Bodeen, I've spent my whole life in baseball. I don't know anything else. He's the best I've ever seen. That good? Yes. He should get a chance. Would you like to sit down? Your husband really doesn't want your son to play. Who knows? Our Sharon is a very devout girl. Maybe it's time the church ordained a female pastor. It may take a day or two, Virgil, but I believe my husband will relent, and Sammy will go to Los Angeles with you. I just ask one thing in return. Yes? He may be a gifted ballplayer as you say, but in all other respects, he's still a child, and I want you to look out for him. Would you do that? You have my word. Sure. Sure. Do you remember what I told you? Yeah. I just don't know why you don't call Weaver. He'll take me right out of the loop. Plus, I promised the mother I'd take care of the kid. Do this for me. Sure. Love you, Sweet. Oh, Sammy. Come on. You have the most wonderful adventure ahead of you. Promise me something. That you'll listen to Mr. Sweet and always do what he tells you. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. I got one for you, kid. You got two out and a man on first. Darryl Strawberry up to bat. Do you hold the runner? Nope. I pitch to the hitter. Why? Strawberry's a home run hitter, likes the ball low and a little outside. So where do you pitch him? Give him fastballs outside, but up a little bit. Why? Make him hit down. You're smart, kid. You learn quick. Who's that? Used to be my coach, son. His name's Iron Jack Kelly. Full-blooded Blackfoot. One of the smartest men in baseball I ever knew. His eyes are weird. Not weird, son. Magical. He could take a look at you, snap his fingers and hypnotize you and make you believe in yourself, do things you could never do on your own. Once I was in a slump. He walked up to me, looked me in the eye, snapped his fingers and said, "You're gonna hit a double." Yeah? What happened? I hit it out of the park. Whew! Only joking. I got a double. Nobody could resist him, son. You got to believe in yourself, son. I want you to discipline yourself. To concentrate. I need total concentration. Put this target... right in your mind's eye, and let your muscle memory take over. Visualize this target. Okay, kid. I want you to relax now. And I want you to look at the target, son. Visualize it. Now close your eyes. Let it go. Aw, jeez! Don't worry about it. Concentrate, kid. You can do it. Don't you think we ought to move the car? Got to believe in yourself, kid. The only difference between you and a Major League ballplayer is that they believe they belong there. Great. That's enough for today. You and Bobbie going to get married, Mr. Sweet? Something comes into your mind, and you just let it right out, huh, son? Well, are you? Well, a man's got to have a lot more going for him than just a scout's salary in order to get married, son. I don't know. Why do you ask? Well, I was just thinking. If you weren't, I... I was thinking about asking her myself. You were, huh? How come you couldn't play anymore? I told you, kid. I got hit. Yeah, I know, but what happens if you try? I can't run. When I run, I get dizzy. Everything else is okay. I just can't run. You know, when I was a little kid, I used to watch... Used to watch Nolan Ryan on TV. And I used to pretend that I could be like him someday. You will, kid. Someday there'll be some kid watching you on TV saying the same thing. Try to get some sleep. We'll be in LA by the morning. Yeah. Hey, kid, who taught you how to pitch? Nobody. Who taught you how to play ball? Nobody. Good night. I don't like games, Miss Henderson. They're a waste of time. Strange thing for a man to say who just bought a baseball team. Don't you think? You want to tell me what's really going on here, Bobbie? Hey, fellas, my limo's here. Eighty nine. Eighty-nine miles an hour. That's pretty good speed, Mr. Lawrence. Kid's name is Miller. He's out of USC. He had pretty good stats. This what you dragged me down here for, Bobbie? Uh, not exactly, Mr. Lawrence. Dick Bortner. He's leading the league in homers. Do you know him, Virg? Yep. So will you. You got five minutes. Couldn't resist the old bone yard, eh? Nice to see you. How are you? Pretty good. How do you like our kid? He's got all the tools. You're going to be real proud of him in a couple of years. Excuse me. Hey, hello there. How does he look on the gun? Very good. Eighty nine. Stay down. Stay down. It's just a ballpark, kid. Let's get out there. Hello, gentlemen. Hey, Virg. There's the kid. Sammy Bodeen. Virgil Sweet, one of our scouts, found him. Mr. Lawrence, I knew nothing about this. There's no authorization. Try and relax, Weaver. It's okay. Bring him in. Fred. Yo, Sweet! Looking good. Just have a good time. Hey, Burnsy. You don't mind if I catch, do you? Nah, it's no skin off my behind. Let me borrow your helmet. You got it. Hey, listen, buddy, who's the new slump meat out there? Sit back and relax, Burnsy. I think you're gonna enjoy this one. Oh, yeah? Yep. See you later, Virg. Here you go, kid. Okay, kid. Warm up. Real nice. Just relax. Yes. Attaboy, kid. This boy do anything besides warm up, Sweet? Let her rip, kid. Come on, son. I was wondering what you wanted for dinner tonight. Huh? Yeah. You ever had sushi? No.It's great. You'll love it. It's very LA. Don't try so hard. Yeah. Ninety eight. Let's see what he can do against a hitter. Bortner. Get a bat. Bortner. Get in there now, come on! Man, oh, man. Show him the fence, Dick. Look funny in that uni, there, Sweet. Name's Richard, isn't it, Bortner? What if I just call you Dick for short? Call me whatever you like. Come on, kid. Whew! What are you doing, kid? He's crowding the plate. So back him off. Throw him a slider. Make him respect you, okay? You know what sushi is? No.Raw fish. Can you believe that? Human beings eating raw fish? Tell him to quit while he's ahead, Sweet? Nope. I told him to bean you. To what? I told him to hit you in the head, Dick for short. Come on, kid. I let my bat do the talking, Sweet. Whoo-wee! Wanna know what he's gonna throw in next, Dick for short? Hey, screw you, Sweet. Throw him a fastball, kid. Yes. Faster. Yeah, that's right. Throw it a little faster, Sammy. Ow! What was the velocity on that? One hundred. Throw it as hard as you can, son. Damn. I can't believe it. One hundred and two. That's a good record.Yeah. Yes. How you feel, Dick? Fred, you better sign this kid before somebody else does. What did you say this kid's name was? Bodeen. Sammy Bodeen. What's his name? Come on in, kid. Virgil Sweet.Virgil. Sign him. Wow. Look at this place. How many people live here? One. One very rich one. Sammy. Sammy, thank God you're here.Ah. Welcome. We have to get upstairs right now. Uh, Mr. Sweet, would you excuse us, please? Where are you going? Mr. Lawrence would like to see Sammy right away. By himself? Yes. Yes. Would you excuse us? Go on up there. Beau! What a space. Unbelievable. God help me, I do love money. Well, you got it here. I haven't seen craftsmanship like this ever. You don't think much of me, do you, beau? What are you talking about, Timmy? You tried to cut my balls off. Took the kid over my head to Lawrence, you and Bobbie. No, gracias. Think I was going to cut you out of the loop? Something like that. It was a beautiful move, Virg. I would have done the same thing myself. Thank you. You're getting to be quite a piece of work. Oh, Timmy, so are you. Listen, uh... Listen, forget it. Kid's got the good face. Yeah, he does. He really, really does. Folks. Can Mr. Lawrence have your attention? May I have everybody's attention please? There's an announcement to make. Good afternoon. Every once in a while, a talent rises up and burns so brightly that, uh, it redefines the limits of the game. From Genesee, Idaho, nestled among rolling fields of wheat, comes such a talent. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you our newest Angel... A gift from heaven. Sammy Bodeen. He's making a cartoon out of this. Sammy, how does it feel to be so celebrated? This is Sammy Bodeen, our newest Angel, and he's the starting pitcher for the Angels on Saturday night. Did you know anything about this? Jesus Christ, Virgil. Where did you play ball, Sammy? Uh, Idaho. Uh, Sammy doesn't have any actual pro experience, Al. He's a phenom. What kind of experience does he have? What's your name? My name is Greg Rossi, Gil. What kind of experience does he have? Greg, as I've said, he has no actual pro experience, but he was born to play the game. Don't you think you're jumping the gun on Saturday night? Really. No. I don't. Isn't this just a publicity stunt to get a lot of people in the stands? Next question. Isn't this putting an awful lot of unnecessary pressure on a young kid like that? Well, Al. It's a game of pressure. He's not ready for this, and you know it. It's a game of inches. With all due respect to this terrific Peter Pan act... if Mr. Bodeen is as good as you say he is, why won't you just let him work his way up through the minors? Do you have a point? I think Eddie Bane might have had a point when he worked for the Minnesota Twins and he was gone in a year. And what about David Clyde? He was gone in the Rangers in about a year. These were all phenoms. You remember Clyde. All right, Virgil. I remember Clyde, yeah. I think you'll be surprised and I think it's safe to say that you will be amazed. Now, everything you need to know is in your press kits. Please pick them up on your way out. In the meantime, relax, enjoy the party, and, uh, we'll see you Saturday night. Go, Angels. Come on, Paul! What are we supposed to go to press with? I think you're making a mistake. You're going too fast. Look, I understand your concern, Virgil, but that's why I need your help. I'm aware of the danger here, but, uh, you got to admit the possibility. I saw what the kid can do with your help. Yeah, but Saturday's too quick to pitch this kid. Yeah, but it's our best available option. The Angels are in the toilet. Now, I want you with us on this, Virgil. Tim's gonna talk to you about it. I got some people in my office right now, but we'll talk. All right? I love it, William. It's wonderful. We're going for an association with the wheat fields. I love the association with wheat. Oh, I feel so great about that. I was trying to capture the field... I have one problem. His face. It's too benign. It's too... Benign. His expression, you mean. He needs to look more dangerous. More, uh... Dangerous. Pardon? A lean, mean pitching... Machine. I'm afraid I don't understand the connection with... Every guy in the country is going to identify with Sammy Bodeen. A stranger from nowhere who shows up... Unannounced. You're Virgil Sweet, aren't you? Yes, I am. Hey, I'm Greg Rossi. Nice to meet you. I don't drink. Oh, here you go. Listen, you're just the guy I want to talk to. You found our young sprout, didn't you? Huh? Well, listen. Why are you starting him on Saturday? What's the big rush? Uh, I'm really not starting him. No, come on, come on. He barely fits his uniform. You're putting him in, up against Kansas City, which is a good team. And you guys have been living in the basement. So what's the story? Listen, I don't know, you know? What? What do you mean you don't know? You're the guy who found him, isn't that right? Yeah, I found him, but I have nothing... Hey, Greg, how you doing? I got to talk to Virgil. We'll be right back. Tim, buddy. Tim. And women like dangerous men, too, right, Miss Henderson? Ah. Mr. Lawrence, I really don't know what women find dangerous or not. I do know that Sammy Bodeen is a very wholesome, open, and honest young man and that men and women will identify with that. You have a point. You may have a point. I have a point.Okay. Let's go with this. That's it. We meet tomorrow morning in my office. You're looking at the new General Manager of the California Angels. You? I'm making you my assistant. Me? Your salary's 60 grand a year, you get a two-year guarantee. Bonuses are included, and I got you on a retirement fund. Wait a minute. What? Wait a minute. Oh, that's really generous, man. You deserve it, Virg. You really deserve it. How about some champagne, eh? Can we have some champagne over here? Yes, sir. Here you are. Here's to Mother Baseball and the talent that keeps her young. What about the kid? Rossi's a reporter. Everything's a scam to him. Are you a reporter, too? You are so sweet. No, Sammy, I'm not. I'm a lawyer. You must be so excited, everything that's going on. Yeah! I can't believe it's real. Well, it is. I mean, come Saturday, you're gonna be pitching in front of 50,000 people, maybe more. Yeah. Look, Virg, you send that kid down to the minors for seasoning, that's no guarantee. He could throw his arm out just as easily in some bush league. Sammy could spend the rest of his days sitting in the backseat of a bus drinking whiskey out of Dixie cups with the rest of the might-have-beens. You know that, Virg. We've been there. So just don't interfere with the plans Lawrence has for the kid. He'll be fine. You and me will take care of him. Guys like us, Virg, we get this kind of chance once in a lifetime. You do this job right, you get a leg up. And nobody's going to get hurt. Hey, hey... All I want you to do is keep Sammy happy. Try not to make any waves, all right? Oh, yeah. You and I are going to go out and get you some clothes something that fits a man in your position. They want me to watch the kid. They want me to stay, Bobbie. They want me to move up to the main office. They want me to be Tim's assistant. We won. Is that what you really want? For $60,000 a year, two years guaranteed, unless I want to quit, yes. Let's warm up. You know, he's just loosening up and he's popping the glove. Look at that. Hey, I don't care how hard this kid throws, man. He don't belong here. Hey, Lawrence doesn't care about that kid. He doesn't care about us. All he's trying to do is make some money off this deal. The kid's got to pay his dues just like everybody else. Hey, look. I expect the kid to fall on his face, just like you guys do. I don't like the idea. I think it's a joke. He's going to make us look bad, too. Come on, kid. Great hit, man. Uh-oh! Check him out! Hollywood! Is he sweet or what? My goodness! I see someone finally got you in a suit, huh? Come on. Get your back into it. How you doing, Fred? Hey, Sweet, where's your boy? He ain't here? Jesus, I was afraid of this. I usually pick him up and I called the hotel. But he didn't answer, so I thought he'd already come out here. Does anybody know about this? I don't think so. All right. I'll find him, Fred. By the way, Lawrence wants to see you up in the club restaurant. Right now? Mmm-hmm. Does he know about this? I don't think so. All right, Fred. I'll find him, all right? Thanks. There's the man. Don't choke, okay, Tim? Hey! You look like one million bucks there, Virg. How do you like him? How do you like our boy's dress, huh? Tell him what you were telling me. Well, we have Sammy's photo session. It's scheduled right after practice today, but Sports Illustrated called. They want an exclusive interview with Sammy for after the game on Saturday. And depending upon the outcome of the game, he can be on the cover next week. I love it. How do you feel, Virg? Huh, great white hunter? How's his arm? Oh, he's doing real good. He's... We're just resting him right now. He's a little excited. Well, the kid looks great. Could we bring down some photographers to see? I think it would be really a good idea instead of always these posed pictures. Actually, it's, uh, best that he rest, I think. He's pretty excited. Virgil knows best. Virgil, I want you to know you're doing a great job. Excuse me. I have some more things to take care of and, uh... Have a good lunch. You look good. Go ahead. Jesus, kid. What are you doing to yourself? What if I fail? You can't think that way, kid. Did you know they were going to pitch me Saturday night? No. No, I didn't. Well, should... Should I pitch? Should I be there? What about Eddie Bane? What about David Clyde? Should they have pitched? They've got nothing to do with you, kid. You're a scout, Virgil. You know more about baseball than anybody. Am I ready? All's I ever wanted to be was a big-league baseball player. Now I don't know anymore. If you want something, sometimes you got to take a risk. And if you really want something, then you got to be willing to risk everything, and that's the scariest thing in the world, son. A bit much, huh, kid? Yeah. How you feeling? I'm all right. ♪ Gave proof through the night ♪ That our flag was still there ♪ O say does that star-spangled ♪ Banner yet wave ♪ O'er the land ♪ Of the free ♪ And the home ♪ Of the brave? ♪ Hi, everybody. And welcome to tonight's ball game between the California Angels and the Kansas City Royals. I'm Ken Brett. And the big story tonight right here at the stadium as young right-handed pitcher Sammy Bodeen takes the mound against the potent Kansas City Royals, who lead the division with two weeks to go in the baseball season. And now, here's our first look at the young phenom that everybody has come out to see this evening. And you've got to be wondering, what is going through the young man's mind as he takes the mound here at the ballpark for his professional and his Major League debut against the Kansas City Royals. And now a little background on the young right-hander, Sammy Bodeen. There he is! He is going to start. 175 pounds and he's only 20 years old, a very young man in a Major League debut. He played no professional, in fact, no organized baseball that we can find. Because we went all the way back to Little League. Hi.Hi. How you doing? Oh, you know. Play ball! Go get 'em. Umpire Hank Robinson signals it's time to play ball, and we're under way here with the professional and Major League debut of Sammy Bodeen. The first batter he faces... Sean Collins, who has very good speed. Bodeen ready to make his first Major League pitch. And here it comes. It's a bunt down the first base line. A very good one by Collins and nobody covers first. And he's gonna be safe. Another look at the bunt in slow motion here. Just a perfectly placed bunt between the pitcher's mound and the first base bag. Bodeen, as you can see, the pitcher, a little late covering. And Collins is on first after one pitch. And that will bring up Rudy Law, the center fielder, a .325 hitter, nine home runs, 61 RBIs. Bodeen checking Collins, who's got good speed at first base. And here's the pitch. A swing and a liner to center. Law has a base hit. Collins rounds second. He's on his way to third. He'll make it with a head-first dive. He'll be all right. He'll be all right. Runners on first and third for the Kansas City Royals. Hitter now, Garris Touson. A .291 hitter, 19 home runs, 81 RBIs, as we start to get into the power guys in the Royals line-up. The pitch as the runner on first goes. A throw to second by Burns, is cut off. The throw back to the plate not in time as the double steal is perfectly executed by Kansas City, as Collins scores. It's 1-0, Royals. And moving on to second is Rudy Law. Just a perfectly executed double steal by Kansas City. Law on second. Count of 1-and-0. Now to Touson. Check to Law, the runner on second. And the pitch... A swing and a grounder up the middle past Davidsmeier. Son of a gun. Okay! Coming around from third to score is Rudy Law. It's 2 to 0. And time-out is called already! Manager Fred Lunney on his way to the mound to talk. Well, they're hitting him. Now, you can't let these guys intimidate you. Okay? You settle down. Kansas City leading 2-0. Nobody out. Runner on first in the top of the first inning here at the ballpark. The batter's going to be Mark Webb... Webb has 30 home runs, 109 RBIs. The pitch, a fastball, a little high for ball one. 1-and-0 to Webb, a .285 hitter. Runner on first. Still nobody out. 2-0, Royals. It's a swing and a line drive... Base hit. Bodeen does not look comfortable on the mound. And you would think the butterflies definitely in evidence in the young man's stomach in front of a sellout crowd here at the stadium. Here's the pitch. Look out! Down he goes! Did it hit him? Did it hit the bat? Umpire Hank Robinson now deciding to award first base to Phil Lombardi and to complicate things here, bases loaded and nobody out for Kansas City. Virgil. Do you think he can turn it around? He's got a lot of heart, Bobbie. Ontiveros still waiting on Bodeen. There's the swing. And a high fly ball to center field. I'm afraid we're having a lot of problems with our friends in the press. What are they saying? Well... They get the feeling they've been duped. They think this is all a fraud, Sammy's just a publicity stunt. Hank Marshall particularly is upset. He, uh, gave me a message for you. He said, read his column tomorrow, and it will not be on the sports page. Front page is where it will be found. I'm sorry. It's been a rocky start for Bodeen, but he has recorded his first out. And here's the first pitch to Lacy. Low and inside for ball one. Kansas City, up to this point in the ballgame, three runs on four hits, and we're still in the top of the first inning. Runners on first and third. Bodeen checking with the catcher, Dan Burns, gets the sign. Check of the runners. Here's the pitch to Lacy. Grounded past the mound toward short. Davidsmeier cuts it off, throws wide to the plate. And diving... Well, I've seen enough. Weaver. Get on the phone. Get him out. You can't do that. What? You can't take the kid out. Take it easy, Virgil. He got him into this. He's gonna have to stand behind him. Virgil, can you hear the crowd? You should have thought of that before you started this. Look, it's my team and I'll do what I want. You got a kid out there that's pitching from sheer courage. He's out there on the mound all by himself and he's got to know that we believe in him. If you take him out now, he may never be able to pitch another batter again. Oh, shut up. Tim, get on the phone to Fred. Get the kid out. I thought you were a baseball man. You're the sorriest chump I've ever seen take a dump between two shoes. Call security. You're fired. You can't fire me, buddy. I got a two-year guarantee. But you know what? You can take that guarantee and shove it where the sun don't shine. I quit. Get out! And take the kid with you. He's a fraud. Now get my lawyer and tell him to tear up the contract. Now, get on a phone. Any phone. I don't care. You call the dugout. And get that kid out of there. Now. What are you looking at? What am I looking at? Your lawyer. Manager Fred Lunney pacing that Angels' dugout, and he's got to be saying to himself, "How much longer can I go with the young right-hander?" It's his confidence. I think I'll fire myself, too. What? Making his way up to the plate now, left-handed hitting Damon Farmar. The first pitch. And it's a swing and a grounder to second. Randle bobbles, tags McQuade throws to first, and they get him. He did it! End of inning! Double play! And Sammy Bodeen is gonna make his way into the Angel dugout. But the damage has been done. For the Royals, in the top of the first, four runs, four hits, no errors. As we head to the bottom of the first, 4-0, Kansas City. Who is it? Weaver. What does he want? Yeah? Hold on a second, Fred. Yeah, Freddy. No. No. Let him start the second. Look. Don't worry. We'll survive. Just get the bullpen up, keep them ready. Anybody makes it to second base, you yank him. Derrel Thomas, the leadoff hitter, a .244 hitter this year, six home runs, 19 RBIs. Here's the first pitch in the bottom of the first. And he swings. It's a high fly ball to center field. Excuse me, dear. Hey, watch it! And Law makes the catch. One pitch, one away in the bottom of the first inning. Quite a change from the top of the first. Lenny Randle, the hitter. Lenny Randle swings at the first pitch. Bounces it right through Giapistol's legs and into center field. So the Angels get their first base runner. And the Angel fans finally have something to cheer about in this ballgame. Charlie, I got to see the kid. Virgil, you know the dugout's off-limits to suits. Runner on first, as the first pitch is swung on and missed by Davidsmeier. And it's 0-and-1 as we get our first look at the Angel third base coach, Mark Budaska. Giapistol working quickly. Another pitch, another swing and a miss. It's 0-2 to the Angel shortstop. Hey, Virg. How you doing? You look sharp, buddy. Good luck today, Frankie. And the throw. The pitcher's swung on a miss. The throw to second. And that's a double play... Let's get that first hitter. Forget them, kid. Just go for it. He's going to leave him in. What the hell's he doing? Where the hell is Weaver? Weaver! Come on, kid. Come on. Bodeen just now finishing up his warm-ups. The catcher is Dan Burns. And due up as the lead-off hitter for Kansas City will be the catcher Chuck Fick. Dan Burns making his way to the mound with some last-minute instructions and to try and settle down the young right-hander, Sammy Bodeen. How you doing, kid? Virgil? Shh. Not so loud. I'm very incognito, son. What are you, nuts? They catch you out here, they'll kick you out of baseball. I'm here to tell you that I was wrong, son. I'm not doing so good. That's why I'm going to hypnotize you, son. What? Remember the first time you ever threw the ball to me? Back home? Right. I want you to go back there in your mind. I want you to forget about this crowd. I want you to forget about everything... Except me. Then I want you to throw the ball to me the way you did that one day in Idaho. Yeah... But... Look at this. No buts. You got no choices, son. It's magic. You're hypnotized. Very long meeting just taken place on the mound between Dan Burns and Sammy Bodeen. And it's finally broken up by the plate umpire, Hank Robinson. And we're set to start here in the top of the second inning. Chuck Fick's gonna start it off for Kansas City. Powerful catcher. A .275 hitter, 25 home runs, 92 RBIs... Breathe. Come on. Come on, son. Come on. Come on. Strike! Strike two! Yes! That's it. Sammy, that's it. That's throwing that pill. Yes. Strike! You're out! Strike three called and down goes Fick. Three pitches and he gets his first Major League strikeout. And it's one out here in the top of the second inning. One down! That's the kid I saw the other day. That's him. And the next hitter will be Tony Tarasco. Tarasco, left-handed hitter, asks for time out, getting settled in the box. Strike! Attaboy, Sam. Tell him, Daddy. When I'm right, I'm right. All right, kid. Two down, Sammy. You're out! Two down! One more. One more. Sammy! Sammy! Sammy! Sammy! Sammy! Sammy! Sammy! Sammy! Sammy! Strike! Come on, kid. Strike two! Time out, ump. Time out! You're doing great, kid. Having fun? I am now. Just one more strike, and this guy's history, and so am I. Mendoza will be in next inning. Do me a favor. He's a rookie, so take care of him. My whole life, the only thing I ever wanted to do was play in the big show, catch one inning of a Major League pitcher. You made my dreams come true, son. You're one hell of a pitcher. Now, do me a favor. Throw me a fastball that knocks my socks off. You want me to close my eyes? No. I don't ever want you to close your eyes again. Sammy! Sammy! Sammy! Sammy! Sammy! Sammy! Strike three! Yeah! Yeah! That was you out there, wasn't it? You could tell? Mmm-hmm. How did it feel to catch a Major League game? Fantastic. Well... You got a big problem now. You can't tell anyone. I want a million dollar bonus, non-refundable upon signing my new contract. I want one million dollars a year, guaranteed for six years, and I want to be paid whether I'm injured or not. Oh. And one more thing, Gil. I won't play on artificial turf. Do it with me. You're so silly.
