[music playing] [ominous music] [movie reel whirring] [ominous music] (SHOUTING) Police! Stop! [grunts] Drop it, or die. OK, OK, I got you. I got you. Get your hands on your head. You good, Jeremy? Yeah, I'm good. Lucky for him, you came when you did. He's all yours, so is the paperwork. Next time, I'll just let you have the collar. Life's all about choices. Hey, you use my words against me. Hey, yo, would you really have shot me? Always ready. Always there. What does that even mean? [grunts] Use your imagination. Hey, yo, would she really have shot me? Not my sister's keeper. You got the right to shut the hell up. Now let's get to step up. [music playing] Hi, chief. Hi. Nice collar on that carjacker last week, Forest. Thank you, sir. You're welcome. You should have let me have that collar. Choices. Ooh. [chuckles] So are you going to the bar? First round's on me. I think I'm going to head home, grab a six. Mm. Drop it, or die-- [laughs] what was that? [laughs] You like that? I did. I liked it. It's all yours. OK. OK. Ooh. I think I'm going to play the number. Sucker. [chuckles] Say that when I'm sipping drinks in Maui. Hope you take better deodorant. Ha, she's kidding. Whatever you say. Hey, what isle is the deodorant? First isle. Mm. [chuckles] I'm a police officer. How nice for you. And what do you do? I work at the DA's office. Oh, that kind of makes us, like, colleagues, right, co-workers a little bit. Yeah. OK. Give me a pack of lamb skins. Extra large. It isn't Christmas. Check your research. Jesus was born in August. We're closed. I just need to get-- Closed. OK, wrong store. Yeah. Hurry up! Buckle up! Hurry the fuck up. OK. It isn't my money. You got that right. Don't forget the lamb skins. Want a receipt, too? Do you want to keep both eyes? Police! Drop it, or die. [music playing] [gunshots] Oh. Come on, mother fucker. [gunshots] [grunting, screaming] [gunshots] [groaning] Megan? I'm good. I'm OK, too. Drop your weapon now! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Just wait. We're cops! [gunshot] Oh, my god. Oh, god. [grunts] Oh, oh. Call 911. Oh, my god. Call 911. Stay there. You're not going to die. Stay with me. Come on. Oh, god. I thought he was going to shoot. [sniffing] Come on. Come on. Stay with me. Stay with me! Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Push. You're OK. You're OK. You're OK. I'm so sorry. [crying] Oh, my god. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. [gunshots] I'm Olivia Dahlly, and I'm running for re-election as your representative in Congress. You know where I stand on the issues. Together, we can make a difference. [gunfire] Welcome back to the Justice Jenny Show. Crime is on the rise in America, but it is our Second Amendment rights that are under assault. I am-- Turn this off, will you? You don't like what she has to say? --and stand-- I come here for booze, not news. I like what she has to say. I keep a cannon under my bar. It's kind of early, isn't it? What did you do, put out an APB? No. Found you all by myself. You should be a detective. You should check your messages. I'm busy. So I see. It's a nice place. At least no cops come here. So Russet says you can come back to work whenever you want. She turned your resignation into a leave of absence. You're killing my buzz. I seriously doubt that. OK, have you-- have you spoken to anyone, a priest or-- A shrink. I was going to say, your father? (WHISPERING) my father-- no, I've not spoken to my father. Why not? Because he's a cop, like you. I'm your partner. Not any more, you're not. Then I'm your friend. Look, either way, I'm worried about you. Don't be. I'm old enough to take care of myself. right, Billy? Yeah, I [inaudible] myself. Look, I'm going camping this weekend with a few friends. You should tag along. It'll do you some good to get you out of the city. Friends with badges? Civilians. He teaches high school, and she's a social worker. Kumbaya. They're good people. You'd like them if you just give them a chance. Call me if you want to go, or even if you just want to talk. Hey, I'm still your rabbi. Don't drink too much. [gunshot] Hey. Good morning. Megan, Blake and Gabriella. It's nice to finally meet you. Same here. Jeremy talks about you all the time I bet. Couldn't have left the work clothes at home? Come on. Hey, once a cop, always a cop. That's what you think. [grunts] All right, say goodbye to all the bad guys. I already have. [fast-paced music] They've been in there all night, doing the devil's work, no doubt. All right, gather around. Everyone stay alert. These are bad hombres. Barry, you stay here. If we get in over our heads, sound the horn. No smokies. Right, Preach. Bow your heads. Dear Lord, protect us from evil and give us strength in our war against your earthly enemies. Amen. Amen. Amen. Everybody comes home, got it? Got it. Let's roll. [suspenseful music] On you, long night. Well, you going to be bitching we unload this shit. I ain't bitching, just tired. We'll get some sleep when we're done because we're going to Philly tonight. I ain't driving. Hector can drive. I like to drive. All this hard work is about to pay off. [garage door opening] Baby, are you coming to bed soon? How many times I got to tell you to knock? We almost smoked your ass. Are you coming to bed? Can't you see I'm working here? You're always working. Well, that's because I'm a businessman. Go back to your horse, or something. I'll be in when I'm ready. [scoffs] That bitch can't get enough of my stuff. [laughs] What are you laughing at? You're supposed to be standing guard outside, eagle eye. [man speaks spanish] [music playing] Beautiful, isn't it? I love the mountains. Those are hills, city girl. [chuckles] Like you'd know. Tell her, Blake. They're mountains. You teach history, not geography. Well, the study of mountains is orology. Whatever. You just made that up. Hills, mountains-- it's all God's country. [suspenseful music] Don't move, chico. Throw your gun on the ground. Get down. Drop it, pigs. [gunshots] Gun! [rapid gunfire] Shit! [grunting] Eduardo Sanchez? Sure, why not. You came to the wrong county, ese. Smell that? Smell that fresh air? [laughs] This isn't exactly a designated campsite. Oh, you don't get the full experience at those designated campsites. We're going to rough it out in the wilderness. What if the wilderness is private property? It's Gods country, remember? Yeah. Do you think it's safe to leave your wheels here like this? I think so. Cooked right under our noses. This is worth a fortune on the streets. We're not the animals. We found $80,000 in the house. You know where to put that. Wait, where's your warrant? I don't like warrants. They leave a paper trail. Well, now I want a lawyer, man. That's not how we do things here. I know my rights. See if I care about your rights. What about this evidence? Burn it. [fire crackling] Ah. That was good, Blake. Gabby, now I see why you married him. [laughter] Thanks. When are you joining the team? Me? Oh, no time soon. I'm still in my prime. Who's going to want you when you aren't? That's a long way off from now. What about you, Megan? My only plan is to go for a hike. Want company? No, thanks. I'm going to try to find some of that peace and solitude I keep hearing so much about. Enjoy. Hey, don't get lost. Are you sure she's OK? Got to take the social worker out of the city. Yeah, she's good, just needs a moment to unwind. I'll talk to her in a few. [music playing] [birds squawking, chirping] Hey, wait up. Are you tailing me? No. Blake and Gabriella wanted some alone time. Mm. I guess I'm some stuck with you. Ooh, I'm feeling the love. Thanks for inviting me. You were right. I needed to get out. The job was getting to me before the shooting, and the city was getting to me all along. Yeah. They both can do that. Maybe I should move out here, get a cabin, or like a teepee. [chuckling] Somehow, I don't think that that's a good idea. I need to do something. I wish you'd reconsider resigning. I miss you in the streets. And the truth comes out. [chuckles] Chief. [spade digging in the ground] Just let me go. [spade digging] Come on, just let me go. [ominous music] Where are you from, Eduardo? Colombia, Mexico? Try the Bronx. I'm as American as you. I guess that depends on your point of view. This ain't right, man. Keep digging. What the hell? You know, I can't be the only one cooking meth around here. Are you working for someone? Maybe we can do some business. We don't work for drug traffickers. They attract too much federal attention. Did you bring your off-duty weapon? It's back in the car. Listen, if you want me gone, I'm gone. Just let me go. Sorry. Too much went down this morning, amigo. What, do you mean them? Listen, I didn't see anything, so I can't be a witness. So just let me go. Sorry, I can't do that, Sancho Panza. All right. Then dig your own damn grave. This man just threatened my life with that shovel? [ominous music] This is bull-- [gunshots] Hey. Where the hell did you two come from? [grunts] Barnes! Double time. [tense music] Barnes? Get those fuckers. Barry, you help me get him to the vehicle. Rest of you know what to do. [grunting, heavy breathing] This way. No, no, no. I don't want to lead them to the camp. Come on. Oh, whoa. What's going on? Guys, we need to get the hell out of here right now. Were those gunshots? Leave everything behind. What are you doing with that? Go. Hey, come on! We can't explain-- Here, you lead the way. I got the rear. [grunting] What do you want me to tell the ER? Nothing. Leave that to me. [vomiting] I bet he's got a concussion. We lost them. There's only one road out of here. Down. Down. Down. Down. Down. Down. Down. [car engine roaring] What's going on? Everybody in. What the hell is going on? We just witnessed the homicide. Why did you flag down those cops? Because they're the killers. They're after us because we saw what they did. What did they kill? An unarmed man, with three other bodies. Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy-- dammit. [gunshots] They're coming your way. My gun's underneath the seat. I don't see any extra ammo. This was supposed to be a quiet weekend. Shit, shit, shit! [gunshots] Come on. Everybody out! Everybody out! Let's go! Come on! This way! This way! This way! Damn them to hell. They're using the trees for cover. Do you want to us to go after them? They have Barnes's gun. It's too easy to ambush us going uphill. We don't catch them before nightfall, we'll never get them. Call up the reserves. Tell Barry we need food and water for an army. On it. Hey, Preach, you better come back here and look at this. Just what we need. [grunting, heavy breathing] Did we lose them? They know I have this gun. By now, they know I'm a cop. That's good, right? It doesn't make a difference. Look, I know I said, no phones. But did anybody break the rules? Really, guys? What the fuck? No service. We just got to talk to them, make them understand. Understand what? We just witnessed them commit a murder. They're never going to let us out of here alive. You don't know that. You don't know what those people did. They were drug dealers, OK? It doesn't matter. They were executed. [siren wailing] What's that? Fire horn. Oh. It's a call to arms. They're bringing in reinforcements. Oh, no. Look, when there's enough of them, they're going to surround us. We got to try to make it difficult for them. Why couldn't you two just have minded your own business? Look what you've gotten us into? We didn't do anything, just wrong place at the wrong time. OK, so what can we do? We're going to split up. What? She's right. We have to split up into two teams and head in different directions. Then we can double our chances of getting away. Wait, wait. Why two teams? By your reasoning, we'd do better splitting up as four individuals. Two guns, two teams. Blake, you go with Meg. Gabby, you go with me? No. You can't expect us to leave each other. Have you ever fired a weapon in your life? I don't suppose video games count. How about you? There's nothing to debate. Try to stay parallel to the road so you don't get lost. I'm not leaving without you. Honey, they're right. This is our best chance, OK? Look-- Look at me. We need to go right now. Like I said, thanks for the invite, partner. When we get back home, first round's on me. You're on. Hey, be all you can be. He's been with [? nicole ?] City PD for 10 years. A month ago, his partner shot and killed a fellow officer. She's on leave. Maybe she's the one that was with him. Maybe all four of them are cops. That took longer than a New York minute. Not by much, it didn't. You could be damn sure we were locked and loaded inside 60 seconds. I don't know which is twat out here. What's the big emergency? I'll give you the rundown when everybody's here. [fast-paced music] The Latinos running this farm were using it as a meth lab. They opened fire on me and my men, and we did what any one of you would have done. We don't need the feds or the media sticking their noses in our business. Unfortunately, we were seen. Seen by who? Outsiders, two men and two women. One of them is Black. They're hiding in the green, and they're armed. Look what they did to poor Barnes. We didn't know if he was going to pull through. I don't have to tell you what will happen if they make it out of here. It's not just me and my men whose necks are on the line here. It's our whole way of life. Either we handle this now, or we start the damn revolution when the feds move in. Revolution sounds good to me. We're not ready for that yet, Vernon. Were supposed to be preparing the next generation for a war they can win. Do you expect us to kill these people for free? The council is offering ten grand in cash for each target. Shit. You don't have to pay me. I'll hunt these motherfuckers for free. Shut up, Darcy. We ain't doing this shit for free. Cocksucker. Blue team will run this command post. Block the main road, and coordinate all activity. Our Minutemen will be red team. We're the only team you need. Yeah, we are. Our militia will be green team. We'll get those four for you. You got that shit right. Not if we bag them we'll you're all having a pissing contest. Our Betsies will be the orange team. At least you didn't make us pink. I'd never make that mistake, Annie. At least I don't piss standing up. No, you do it on all fours. You want to go a few rounds? I bet you'd like that. You're playing for the wrong team. Save it for the enemy, ladies. We know these woods better than any of you. Oh, I didn't see you arrive, Cletus. Because we didn't want you to know we were here. Sister fuckers. What did you say? Oh, we're just admiring your outfit, Claudette. It better be I you're admiring. Oh, relax. We know you're with your brother. Come again? Sorry, Cletus. I meant to say, cousin. You girls watch yourself. We want to be shadow team. That's fine, Wade. The Wagners will be shadow team. Our targets are outnumbered and outgunned. We have to find them before dark, promised my wife I'd be home for dinner. Yeah, I told mine the same thing. [laughter] Leave your beer behind. I don't want you shooting each other by mistake. Bring them back warm if you can, but cold suits me just fine. Good luck, and good hunting. Make no mistake, this is war, maybe not the one we wanted, but the one that landed in our backyard. How do you plan on explaining all this away? We won't have to. These people were never here. We just have to cover our tracks. Sounds like bullshit to me! Dead or alive! Dead or alive! Dead or alive! Dead or alive! Dead or alive! Dead or alive! [ominous music] They have all the fun. You forgot to mention one of our targets is a cop. I didn't forget anything. Remember, the Firearms League is honoring you on Tuesday. I'm so sick of those Rust Belt luncheons. Are you sick of the press they generate? Dust off my usual speech. You got it. [cell phone buzzing] I told you, never call me on this line unless it's an emergency. We have a situation. Pull over. Get out. Excuse me? You heard me. Wait on the curb. Lay it on me. [helicopter whirring] Down! We should be out there waiving our arms. No one good is looking for us. Keep it together, Gabby! [sobbing] You good? I think so. Let's go. Green team to blue command. Go ahead, green team. Found their campsite and a couple of IDs. We got a high school teacher and a social worker. Bunch of damn do-gooders. Good work. Torch everything. One cop, two civilians. One question mark. [heavy breathing] Oh, no. [ominous music] Keep moving. What do you see, Caleb? Two of them up ahead. That's $20. 5K each. What am I, your squire? There's five of us. That's 4K apiece. Whatever you say, Mr. high school graduate. [grunting] Come on. We've got to keep going. [heavy breathing] I need rest. Look, they're gaining on us! You go on without me. No deal. I can't keep this up. Here, take this. Take it. [grunts] Keep both hands on the gun. Squeeze the trigger. Don't pull it. You only got six shots, so don't waste any. Now go. I told you I can't run anymore. Then walk fast, but go. What about you? I'm going to lead them away from you. No. Look, I'll circle back and catch up as soon as I can, all right? Now get going. Come on. Go. Now these two have split up. Then we'll split up, too. [tense music] [helicopter whirring] [gunfire] [grunting, heavy breathing] [suspenseful music] Stay back! [sobbing] Put the gun down, miss. You don't want to hurt anyone. You surely don't want to kill us. It's all a big misunderstanding. Stay back, you redneck sons of bitches. I'll shoot if I have to. No you won't. No you won't. That a girl. That a girl. Easy. Easy now. Don't you ever point a gun at someone unless you intend on using it! [sobbing] [heavy breathing] [grunting] [groaning, grunting] [screaming] [neck cracking] [ominous music] [gunshot] [gun cocking] [gunshot] [ominous music] I call dibs on any women. There's no calling dibs, Darcy. I fucking call dibs anyway. Jesus, would you stop being a pain in my ass? I'm sick of you given Darcy a hard time, Coyle. She's arguing with me. That isn't how I see it. Hey! I thought we're all supposed to be on the same fucking team! Yeah, we ain't out here hunting each other. It's OK, Mojo. We're just messing around, right, Coyle? Yeah, fine. Can we please just go make some money? Just don't piss me off. Fine. Come on! [gunshots] Martin, Wilcox. Don't make me shoot you in the back. You fucking-- [gunshots] You-- you killed them like they were nothing. You better be ready to do the same if you want to see your wife again. Ranger, it's Vernon. Go for me. Darky killed Bowen, so Caleb killed him. We captured a Latina. Bitch was packing a 38. Good job. Bring her in. Roger that. We have to go back. If we do, we'll be killed, just like Jeremy. How could you be so cold? He was your friend, too. He was more than a friend. He was my partner, and he would want us to keep going. I can't leave Gabriella. Her only chance is if we make it out of here and bring back help. That could take hours, days. Do you really believe she'll still be alive then? No. Then I'm going back, with or without you. You don't even know where they are. I'll find them. If they don't find you first. Either way-- Nothing you do is going to change what's going to happen to Gabriella. She wouldn't want you to die for nothing. Good luck. You too. [helicopter whirring] Dragonfly, it's [? wolf ?] man. [? go for blue, ?] wolf man. I see you finished your blow. They're all dead. What? Your survivors didn't survive so well. That makes six casualties on our side. We have to get this bird back to base. We only promise you one pass. Affirmative. Thanks for the assist. Let God sort them out. Amen, brother. [distorted sighing] [heavy breathing, grunting] [ominous music] [gunfire] On the boulder! Ma, Cletus! Leave them be. Can't do anything for them now. Blood for blood. [fast-paced music] There she goes! You two, after her. Come on. Come on, [inaudible]. [rapid gunfire] There she goes! Hey! [gunshots] [gun clicking] [rapid gunfire] Hey, Grizzly Adams! [rapid gunfire] [heavy breathing] [ominous music] What is it, Annie? Nothing. Let's get that bounty. Hell, yeah. Let's do it. Caleb's still in the wild. Wait outside. When do we get our money? When this is over. Welcome to Eden, Gabriella. We found your idea at your camp. You killed Jeremy, didn't you? Only after he killed one of our men. Is my husband alive? For now. But you can help us bring him in safely. I'm not helping you do shit. You weren't even there, were you? There was another woman that ran away, but it wasn't you. The people we shot were criminals, not embezzlers, not tax dodgers, real bad guys. That's none of our business. Let us go, and I swear we'll never say a word to anyone. We both know better. That's a beautiful cross. Are you a believer? Jesus Christ is my Savior. That makes this more difficult. We're a Christian community. Christians don't commit murder. Who's the other woman? Tell me her name, and I'll make this as easy for you as I can. What difference does her name make? I like to know who I'm hunting. You're police. You're supposed to protect people. We protect our own people. You're the one that needs protection now. [ominous music] Oof. [grunts] [sobbing] I've known you most of your life, Barry. I brought you into this department because you believe in our cause. Are you ready to take the next step into a larger community? Yes, sir. Then send this bitch to a better place. [crying] Preach? I understand your hesitation, son. But it has to be done. Shoot her in the head. [crying] What are you waiting for? I'm sorry. I just never shot anyone before. That's what our movement is all about, shouldering responsibility others are too weak to bear. Don't listen to him, Barry. This has nothing to do with strength. He's nothing without you. She's trying to confuse you. I'm trying to save you. Shoot her now. Make him do his own dirty work. [crying] God forgive me. [gunshot] Where are you? [ominous music] [groans] Incoming! Gabriella! Blake! Yes! [gunshot] Let go of me! [screaming] [rapid gunfire] No! [crying] Oh, God. Do it. I can't. [gunshot] I hope you get a chance to redeem yourself. Grab a shovel. [ominous music] You just drop that gun. And the side arms. Rise and shine. [tense music] Now turn around. I don't know you. I'm not from around here. All you need to know is that there are people trying to kill me. But that doesn't tell me a whole lot now, does it? What are you doing here? I witnessed an execution. Hmm. That explains the shooting that I heard today, thought it sounded livelier than the usual tomfoolery. Get inside. I would feel safer with my weapons. Well, I'd be safer with them out here. Their camp was here. She took out green team here and is moving in this direction. Frances is out there. Frances won't help her. She'll shoot anyone that sets foot on our property. Crazy bitches stick together. Says the man who was drummed out of the army on a Section 8. Oh, you're looking for a beat down. Squash this. I have enough problems to deal with while you two nitwits going at it. Orange team to blue command. Go for blue command. Wagners are dead. She took him out a close range. I like her style. So John Preacher killed some folks today. My god. The fools have finally gone too far. I need a phone. The radio I took won't reach far enough to do me any good. Yeah, well, you came to the wrong place. What about a car? Oh, I just got a daughter in town with a car. But she only checks in on me every few days. It's a lovely little town you got here. Yeah, well, I live here because I always have, not for the company. Why is everybody following this Sheriff? Well, I'll tell you. You know the Revolutionary War? Well, there was a battle that was fought in these hills. A handful of farmers, Minutemen-- they held off the red coats until the militia arrived. Now the folks that live around here-- well, they're descendants of those brave souls. So you see, tradition-- it's important to us. It's in our blood. That tradition include murder? Oh, those Billy Bobs-- they're prepping for a war against the government that they can't possibly win. I mean, mostly it's just a show so they can play with their damn guns. They got a bunker not very far from here, some kind of a training camp. I wonder if there might not be some kind of a radio set there that you could use to call for help. [car approaching] Stay still if you want to stay alive. [suspenseful music] What are you boys doing on my property? Now, hold on, Frances. We don't want any trouble. Well, get in your vehicle, and there won't be any. We're looking for a woman. Try a whorehouse. This one's dangerous. And I'm not? She's armed. You don't say. We have to look inside. You do, and I'll shoot you. Nobody comes inside without an invitation. And I'm not feeling very hospitable right now. This is a matter of law, Frances. Who's law, yours or mine? There's only one law. On my land, that's me. Is she here or not? You missed her by 20, maybe 30 minutes. She asked for directions to the highway, so I gave them to her. Did she give you her name? No, she didn't mention that. She did say that you idiots killed some folks today. She killed some herself-- good men. [laughs] There hasn't been a good man around here since my husband died, God rest his soul. Have a blessed day, Frances. Keep your door locked until this is over. Hey, you go looking for judgment day, you may just find it. [car engine starting] Go uphill for about a mile till you come to a side road. That'll take you to the bunker that I told you about. If I had had my weapons just now, I could have finished this. Well, first of all, I just saved your life. And second, you're welcome. Now get the hell out of here before somebody else gets killed, namely me. Thank you. Hey, if they pin you down, give them hell. Why aren't you back at the station? Walter said that you needed this force woman's jacket right away, so I ran it over myself. That's her. Her father was Buffalo PD Brass, and her brother carried a gold shield. She's only been on the job for two years. A bitch and a rookie. Nice language. You can go now, Kayleigh. Guess I'll go file my nails. She served in the National Guard, and spent two years in Alibaba land. Combat? Motor pool. She trained for a war she never got to fight. So did we. [suspenseful music] Hello? Hello? Fuck. [suspenseful music] Whatever you're thinking, forget it. Drop your hardware, and raise your hands. Nice and slow, darling. Step forward so you're not tempted to do anything stupid. We can take you back with your face or without it. Thought most of you yahoos around here were men. Freedom fighters. Domestic terrorists. Annie, I'm tired of her mouth. I like her mouth. [laughs] It isn't smart to antagonize us. Cuff her, Jo. With pleasure. You don't have to do this. You could walk away or help me. In the name of sisterhood, we've got 10,000 reasons not to roll over for you. A bounty. 3,300 apiece, not bad for an afternoon's work. We didn't even have to fire a shot. Fire! [rapid fire] [gunshots] [suspenseful music] Hey, good looking. Why did you 86 them? You're on the same team. You capped those broads, not me. Now I kill you, collect $10,000. I've already got 10 coming to me for killing your Black friend. What about my other friends? You're the last of the Mohicans. It was boring around here until you showed up. Pick it up if you want to dance. Ooh, fight back. I like rough. [grunting] Ah. Ah. [growls] [grunting] Body shots, huh? [grunting, groaning] [thudding] [grunting] [grunting, groaning] [screaming] You fucking bitch! [gunfire] [screaming] [gunshots] [breathing heavily] Orange team, come in. Preacher for orange team. Come in. Go for orange. What's your 20? I'm at some old training camp. Annie? Annie's dead, so are the rest of them. Some asshole with long hair got them before I got him. Caleb. Turn yourself in, Megan. There's no escaping. [laughs] I don't want to escape, Preacher. You started this. I'm going to finish it. I'm going to finish you. You triggered the wrong bitch today. Out. Hello? Hello? Son of a whore. Vernon, don't go to that camp. It's a trap. There's a debt to be paid for Caleb, and I [inaudible].. I'm in charge of this operation! I order you to stay put! And I thought you was about personal freedom. Come on, boys. Let's go break out the big gun. What now, Preach? Circle the wagons. Pull all of our other people off the roadblocks. Mom, Dad, I got myself into a real jam. And I couldn't save my friends. I wish I could. I'm going to take a record of everything that goes down today. Before that, I want you to know how much I love you and how much I wish I could see you again. I-- [crying] I'm sorry. I'm sorry I couldn't save them. I'm sorry. I just wanted to be good for you. I just wanted to make you proud. But I'm going to make things right. If it's the last thing I would do, I'm going to make things right. [car aproaching] Padlocks off the door. She broke in there. [rapid gunfire] Take over. Keep your finger off the trigger. I don't want you perforating me prematurely. I ain't no idiot. [ominous music] [gunfire] [tense music] [screaming, gunfire] [ominous music] Let's go! Hurry up! Let's go! Come on! Let's go! No screwing around. We take this bitch out. We go home. Everyone goes home. Let's do it. [ominous music] [suspenseful music] [gasps] [knife stabbing] [gunfire] [metal clanging, squelching] [screaming] [gunfire] Get the hell out of here! Do you want to get shot in the back? [gun clicking] She's out of ammo. I wouldn't count on that. [whizzing, squelching] [groaning] [metal thudding] [military music] Oh, good god. Here comes the crazy train. Well, who's that? She who must not be named. [chuckles] Park it somewhere safe. Congresswoman Dahlly. Get out. Welcome home. Mm. There is no way I was going to miss this. Only the female cop is left. We lost a lot of people today. You just tell me where to find the bitch. [music playing] Red team, come in. Vernon, are you out there? How about my strike team? Damn it. I think it's time we packed it in. Have you lost your mind? I think we all have. Are you going to spend the rest of your life in prison over one woman? Beats being dead. What will the council say? Think about your family. I am thinking about them. Pick up, Preacher. Are you going to get that, or am I? Go for me. I handled red team and the other deputies. The rest of you are under arrest for murder and accessory. You've got 30 seconds to lay down your arms. You're out of your jurisdiction. You're not even on active duty. Call it a citizen's arrest. How many people did you kill today? Ask me again when I see you. I'm done. Screw my pension. You want to leave, be my guest. Time's up. [ominous music] We're in the shit now. I didn't sign up for this. Well, man the fuck up. Yes, ma'am. [gunfire] Shit. Ah. [gunfire] We're going to need a bigger gun. [gunfire] Walter! [gunfire] Hey! [explosion] Hallelujah. [gunfire] [gunshot] Preacher! Drop your weapons now! [gunshots] [music playing] Recognize this? Please, I have a wife, a son. My friends had families, too. Jesus. I don't even know if Blake and Gabriella had kids. I had a brother and a brother-in-law until about two minutes ago. You have a knack for killing lawmen. What do you know about the law? I know how little a street cop makes. I have $80,000 from those traffickers. It's yours if you let me go. Give it to those families if you want to. Get on your feet. Up. Where is it? Do we have a deal? Show me the money first. You have me at a disadvantage. You got that right. Speak now or forever hold your peace. It's in the glove compartment. Keys. You are a disgrace to that uniform. Take it off now! Take it all off. Eighty grand. Was it worth it? Takes money to build an army. Did Gabriella beg for her life? How about Blake, hmm? Mistakes were made. I'll give you that. But if you pull that trigger and shoot me in cold blood-- I'll be no better than you? You already pushed me over that line. -You wanted to be pushed. -You think you know me? You only became a cop because of your daddy, but you couldn't handle the shit. Now you're trying to prove you have what it takes. You murdered my friends. If you were going to kill me, you would have pulled that trigger already. [ominous music] No, no, no, no, no, no. [gunshot] No! I don't want to put you down. I want to put you away. Get your hands on your head. I'm taking you in. You have no idea what you're getting yourself into. I think I do. You guys aren't all that hard to figure out. We just might surprise you. FBI is going to love your ass, so is gen pop. You don't want my friends for enemies. [scoffs] They don't want me for an enemy. You just assassinated a Congresswoman. I'm probably going to get a book deal on a TV show. You know what to do. Tighter. We have chapters all over the country. They'll find you, no matter where you hide. I'm not hiding. That a girl. Daddy would be proud. [siren wailing] What is that? [laughs] What the fuck is that? [chuckles] We were just the first responders. Do you realize how many men there are in this county, how many guns? Well, it's a good thing I have you with me. Too bad you just killed my hostage negotiator. There won't be any negotiating. You'll never get out of here alive. And neither will you. We'll see. Get moving. [MUSIC - ARMAND JOHN PETRI AND JOE ROZLER, "WILL I EVER BE THE SAME?"] (SINGING) The wind is full of lies. A flying bullet cries and searches for the mark to kill and cool a burning flame. Will I ever be the same? A carnival of fools. The master steals the jewels. Hiding from the flame that goes beyond another name. The wind is blowing cold, telling stories never told. I'm screaming for the final life. Who will take the blame? Will I ever be the same? The wind is full of lies. The final bullet flies, searching for another life, a sole, a prize to claim. Will I ever be the same? Searching for the truth to tell, when will I decide? I can never cry and hide.
