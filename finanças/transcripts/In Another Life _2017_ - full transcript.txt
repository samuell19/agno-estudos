Say this city has ten million souls. Some are living in mansions, some are living in holes. Yet, there is no place for us, my dear. Yet, there is no place for us. They call this place "The Jungle." But The Jungle is for animals, not for humans. In Calais, we are treated like we don't exist. We are ghost people. Before I came here, I had never broken any laws, never stole anything. But now... I'll do anything to get out of here. To escape. Mima was my first friend on the camp. Found me a tent, got me a sleeping bag, showed me the church. When you have nothing at all, small things are magnified. He may be small, but he's one of the strongest people I know. He's my brother. And you have, what, like, police and everything? Of course, the police will need to stop you when they catch you, they drop you very far from outside the train station. And then we're gonna come back again. But when you are at the train station, you tried to, to, to get into the train? Yeah, yeah. Okay, so you never tried to jump into the tracks? Yeah, oh, I've tried. We tried to cross every two days, one day to rest, one day to fail. Rest, then try again. The days blend into one another. ♪ That man ♪ ♪ From the Middle East ♪ ♪ Sometimes treated as a human Sometimes as a criminal ♪ ♪ This world with no mercy Of which we are all part ♪ ♪ Not everyone has mercy ♪ ♪ Politicians ♪ ♪ Luxurious shoes ♪ ♪ Counting until ten ♪ ♪ And they want more ♪ ♪ Airplanes, watches ♪ ♪ Full wallets ♪ ♪ Treaties, laws, walls And condemnations ♪ ♪ Nothing to lose I will see you tomorrow ♪ ♪ Nothing to lose ♪ - Go on, fuck off! - Damn you! If the police catch you, they drive you far away. Make you walk back to The Jungle. They want to break your spirits. But they can't break what is already broken. Most of the people living here are trapped. We cannot go forward, we cannot go back. So we must stay here. In another life... I was a teacher. Now, I'm a refugee. A Syrian. My name is Adnan. You know, the boat is very small. Did you have life jacket? No, we don't have. -We didn't have life jackets. -Oh, okay. Just, we are wearing normal clothes. And we are almost 250 something on a small boat. So before reaching the international sea, the military, before they came to saving us, almost, their boats has break down. So, I remember the one... woman, she had a crying baby and then she was sitting next to me. You know... like, if you don't know how to swim, you cannot save your life, you know? And then the woman, she don't know how to swim, but she tried to push the baby to see if, if I can help her. I try. But I can't hold the baby, you know? Because when I go to get her, the other people they just, - they pull me down in the sea. - Yeah, yeah. So I have to save my life, you know. So... Honestly, it's like, it's very painful. And... Finally... the baby like... I'm just asking myself, I'm a very selfish person because I cannot save her. She died on the sea. I hate myself. That woman, I'll never forget in my life. One day, if I get a better life, that makes me always... There is something painful in my heart, you know? So our life is not, like, safe. Anyways... Assalamu alaikum. -Adnan? -Yeah. -Take a seat. -How are you, man? -Good. -Where have you been, Adnan? Can I see your hand, please? I mean... - Could be worse. - Jesus Christ. My God! Adnan. It's okay. Why don't you go to clinic, please? - No. - Please. I say please. -Mima, no. -Your hand is... -already is bleeding. -Mima, it's okay. - Oh, no, no. - It's okay. -Please, my friend. -Mima, it's okay. All of us, we try, just, please, my brother. Take care, man. I know, all of us, we need to go to Britain but you have to be careful. Are you still going to go cross? Yes. We have to get out of here, okay? As long as I have my legs, I will keep trying. The more people that come, the worse the sanitation gets. Some days, the filth in the toilet overflows. We have no status. When it happens, it happens so quick. You don't even notice your life being erased. If it can happen to me... it can happen to you. Yousef moved to Syria from Palestine, he was unlucky. We all have our ways we try to get out of here. Yousef is getting friendly with the traffickers. In here, we have two choices. Do nothing or do something. Hmm. I don't know, my friend. What? All the rain. It's getting really cold. You know, I have no boxers. I have no jacket. I have no socks. My shoes have holes in them. -Take this one. -No! -Yousef, take it. -I can't. I can't. Yousef! -Thank you. -Take it. I'm freezing my balls off here, my friend. -Come on. -Come on. Give me one minute, okay? Otherwise, there's no food for you tonight, okay. -No fire, no food. -That is not fair. It's 50 euros. We don't have it. I'm sorry. I can think of another way you can get it. You take my friend in a camp, I give you 40 euro. The refugees in Calais stick together for protection. Eritrean, Sudanese, Ethiopian, Syrian, Kurds, Iraqis. Different nations, different reasons. But, we are united by one thing. A desire to escape. You know, Adem isn't the only one who can get you stuff. - Who else? - Sami. -Sami isn't to be trusted. -Well, what trafficker is? Hey, Adnan. Back home, we have a saying, people like them, they will fuck their mothers and salute their father. I want it. - Hey. - Kevin Hart. James Dean. - How was your day? - Okay. -What's wrong? -Nothing. -You haven't found socks yet? -Huh? You haven't found socks? How's your day? Good, I went to have some food. -What did you get? -Same as yesterday. Uh, listen. I think I found someone. For really cheap. How much? It's good enough. Let's talk to him first. Because I'm not sure exactly. But, he seems that he want to help us. -But did he told you how much? -No. He said let me talk to you guys. We'd meet up. Uh, we'd have to talk to him. It's probably because I've heard from Hamed... and he only paid 500 euros. Which is very good. I don't have the 500. It's okay, I have it. My family's gonna send some money over in, uh, two days' time. In Syria, we have a saying, "With the lack of horses, we saddle the dogs." Yousef always had a story. If he said things often enough, he started to believe himself. My parents will be sending me money in two weeks' time. -Where are you from? -England. Well... Well, I'm going to England. In two weeks, my parents will send me the money. There are a few ways to escape Calais. There are the trucks, you can risk your life on the train. Or you can buy a fake passport. If you have the money. -It's magic. -Magic of pen. -You are a magician. -One, two, three. -One, two, three. -One, two, three. -Where is it? -What do you think? -Walaikum assalam. -Walaikum assalam. Walaikum assalam. I'm Yusef. -I'm Adnan. -Adnan. Five hundred? Five hundred euros? And say "Hi" to Sami. Damn. It is getting harder to reach the UK. So the refugees are taking bigger risks. And all I can think about is Bana. Where are you? Bana. Bana. How's it going? -I'm tired, man. -Yeah. I'm trying to cross again tonight, you want to come with me? Yeah, why not? Yeah, we'll go, my friend. We go. We must. How do you make money in The Jungle? Like when the journalist and other people, when they come from Europe. I'm gonna try to... I'm gonna try to guide them about "The Jungle" life and then I will tell them... how's Jungle. So I'm gonna charge that when I speak, someone who is journalists, it's not free, my friend. And you're not scared to be on... TV or on-screen or Internet? You know, whether, if I'm on the TV or not, already my family, still they are suffering, you know? See. It's not because, you know... From the beginning, when I left my country, the government, already, they arrest my mum, also my sister, they're not even going to school. -So... -Why, why did you leave there? I'm a journalist in my country, I'm just... working on the free press in the magazine. The government accused me then they put me in the jail, and then they tortured me. What they did to you? You know, in our prison, the government when... they catch up to you, they did this called, like darkroom, you know. So, they will tie you on the chair and then they shock you in electric, you know. -They did that to you? -Yeah. And then like, there was putting your head underwater. I have to find a way to make money. In here? Ay! As long as you if don't give your face for camera, you'll never get any money, my brother. There are 9,000 people living in this camp. This isn't how we imagined we'd be welcomed to Europe. I remember the first day I got here. I saw a truck driver slamming on his breaks to make the cargo in the back fall on the refugees. Breaking hard. When the truck stopped, they stumbled out and were beaten by the police. Eventually, they made it back to their tents. But one of them died from internal injuries that night. A 22-year-old Sudanese man. When you die, they put rocks on your tent, and wait for the burial. I can't look across this camp in the same way, knowing that there are dead bodies. That truck driver who went home, and he may never know... he killed a man. Bana. Bana... we have to go. Over here. Over here! Mima. Mima... I checked Mima's tent this morning. He wasn't there. Maybe he crossed. I have a bad feeling, Yousef. You know, the best survivors in the camps are the Afghans. They have the shops, they control the economy, they're very professional. Those guys have experience, they know the system. And then, you look at us, we're like the middle class, we don't cheat, we don't know how to survive. It's like the Afghans are the sharks and we're the fish. And Adnan, believe me, believe me, believe me, I really, really don't want to be a fish anymore. So, what you want to start eating the refugees now? No, but I want to survive. -Hello. -Hi. -This my friend, Adnan. -Hi. -How's The Jungle? -Shit, as usual. And the police, they're brutal, eh? I charge normally 500, but since you're a friend of Mo's, 400 each. I don't think anyone should have to live this way. That's why I want to help. My family fled Eastern Europe, so I understand. Inshallah, I can get you to good old England by the end of tonight. Okay, well, we need a day or two to get the money. My truck leaves tomorrow. I am not here this week in Calais. I... Here, then Dunkirk, then Italy next month, I move around. I, I don't stay long in a place but you're lucky to catch me here. Okay, if, if we get the money. Who do we have to give it to? You give it to me. Is there any chance we can meet up with you later this afternoon? Let's meet tomorrow night at the car park of the supermarket on Boulevard Curie. And I will give you instructions there. My truck's all head to Birmingham which is in the center of the UK. It's the number two city, when you get out of the truck you look the first person in the eye and you say you love Ozzy Osbourne, Slade, and UB40 and you'll be fine. It's a great city. -Four hundred, right? -Four hundred. Okay. You think he's serious? I think it's cheap. I know. Do you have the money? I have Bana's ring. My grandmother gave me this ring. Here, take it. No. Take it. It's your ring, I cannot. Adnan, take it. -It is a promise ring. -A what? -A promise ring. -A promise ring? I promised her, and now you have to promise me. I promise you. -What? -You don't even know what you have to promise, yet. It doesn't matter. Whatever you want, I promise you. -Ask anything. -Okay. You have to get us to England. Easy. Gentleman. You have to go down the coast to the children's playground on Digue Gaston Berthe. My driver will pick you up from there. Okay. You have my number, he will be there in an hour or so. -Thank you. -Not a problem, my friend. Good luck and safe passage. Adnan! -Adnan. -Leave me alone, Yousef. Adnan, look at me. What, Yousef? Adnan, we have to get our money back. -From who? -From the two brothers. They're the ones who recommended him. They rather kill you, Yousef, than give you the money back. It's over. We've been ripped off. Accept it. It's over. Fuck! Fuck! I'm gonna fucking kill these guys. -I can't fucking believe it! -It's over. - It's over. - Adnan. This is fucking embarrassing. How could you let us fall for this? It's over, Yousef. Adnan, you don't seem to care anymore, man. You think I don't care about our money? Huh? Of course, I care! Well, let's fucking do something! What the fuck is wrong with you? What is wrong with me? What is wrong with you? It's always you. I'm gonna leave... Trust me. Let's listen to this guy, let's listen to that guy. It's always... You know what? I'm tired of you, Yousef. Okay? I'm tired. Yeah, yeah. I'm tired. You're tired of me, Adnan? I am tired of you! This is all I fucking had, Adnan! Adnan, it's all I had. This is all the money I had, Adnan. Look at me. What about me, Yousef? I had to sell Bana's ring to get this money, Yousef. Bana's ring to pay them. Look at me. I will talk to my parents and they'll send us money. What? I'll give my parents a call and they'll send us money. It'll be here in two days. How long are you gonna keep on saying your family is gonna send you money? You've been saying the same thing on and on. Yousef, "My family is going to send me this. My family is going to send me that." The money never comes. The money never comes, Yousef. Calling me a liar? You're calling me a liar, Adnan? No. I don't know. Fuck you! Fuck you! I will get my fucking money back myself. Fuck you, Adnan! Fuck! I want my money back. -Move away. -I want my money. Go anywhere, and don't come back here. -Yousef. -Yousef, come on. Did you see that? Everybody, take your clothes off. No. No! No! You think this is what's happening? No! This is happening to you. - All of you! - No! You will be the next! No, no. -No! -Shh, bald man, don't cry. Let me see you. Don't be shy. Show your dick to us. - Okay. - Go back to Syria. Fucking monkeys. Fucking monkeys. Go home. The worst thing about The Jungle is the humiliation. We are made to feel subhuman. We know it. It is deliberate. We are not wanted, an embarrassment. The police fire tear gas at us every night. We are abused in the streets. Even the strongest people can lose their mind in here. The camp won't be here long. The aid workers are being stopped from bringing in food and clothes. And slowly, the police are pushing us further from the roadside. How far are we from Calais, Adnan? I think 100 miles. But this is good. It's safe, we can stay here for two days. We have food. When we go to The Jungle... What? What will happen there? I don't know. It's gonna be okay. It can't be worse than what we've been through already, no? And I know there are lots of ways to... how to reach England. How, Adnan? Well, there is the wagons with the train, there is the trucks, there is the ferry. -There are lots of ways. -Adnan. -What? -This is all so dangerous. Yeah, it's dangerous but it's worth it. This is why we left. We knew it would be dangerous, no? I'm scared, Adnan. It's okay to be scared. -Open the borders! -Open the borders! Open the borders! Open the borders! Open the borders! Open the borders! Open the borders! Open the borders! Back, back! Move! Move! I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Go, Adnan! Fly! No, no, no. Do you speak French? -Speak English? -Yes. Little. Oh, good. Okay. How do your eyes feel? A bit better. And your head's better? -It's moving. -Where are you from? Syria. And you've been in The Jungle a long time? Five months. Whereabouts do you, stay in the camp? What section? With the Sudanese and Ethiopians. Do you know The Jungle? Yes. I volunteer there in my spare time. -Where? -In the medical van, my friend set it up by the library. Where are you trying to reach? -England. -Ah. What part? Manchester. -My wife's brother lives there. -Well... I think you're ready to be discharged today. But why don't you come and see me in the medical van in The Jungle? You know that thing about my parents? Hmm. You were right. -It was a lie. -What do you mean? The truth is I haven't spoken to them for over two years. Why? I was sent to jail. They told my parents I stole a car. Two years, Adnan. Two years in jail. Soon the prison started filling up with people, demonstrators, innocent civilians. And then when the bombing started we all thought we were going to die. A lot of us we found a chance and we ran, we ran and we did not look back. What about your family? I tried to call them many times. But they would never reply to me. I'm sorry. The truth is, Adnan... speaking about my parents, it makes me feel less alone, you know? You're not alone. You have me. It's hard not to feel alone in The Jungle. On the way here with Bana, I saw many children. You would think they would be the first to get help. But children are the most at risk. Many of them have gone missing. Adnan, Bana. Adnan Bana. Rosie. - Rayanne? - Rayanne. I don't think you want to stay here. This camp is mostly from Iraq. -From Kurdistan. -I mean we have no problem -with people from Iraq-- -No, no-- I just-- -My wife needs to take a shower. -Okay, Okay. Yeah, there is... there is no showers here. There's just water at the end of the road, but it's a really dirty tap. Sometimes a charity called "Salam," they come, they come maybe three times a day and they bring food and water and things like that. You're from England? I'm from England, yes. - Thank you-- - Is it dangerous here? - Nice to meet you. - Thank you. This camp, yeah, it's dangerous. There's been, um, reports of guns like, some shootings here. There's a problem with smugglers in this camp. Like there's smugglers in The Jungle too, but there's more people there, there's more things, like there are some showers, there are toilets. That doesn't happen here. Adnan. Adnan, wait. What's wrong? I'm thirsty, I can't walk anymore. My ankle is hurting. Okay, come. Come, come. We should go. You're okay? -Okay, go. -Hey, it's okay, okay. What are you doing? Adnan, no, no. Just hide. Hide. -Hide, hide, hide. -Adnan. Adnan. Adnan, wake up. It is my birthday. I am 22 in Syria. In Calais, I don't know what my age, -In Germany... -32. Hi, can we have four coffees, please? No, no. Thank you. Four coffees. Maybe I can meet a nice English man here. Or even a French man, I don't care. -You make me visa, right? -Visa! Excuse me? We would like normal cups, please. Please. There are many good people who have helped me on the camp. Aid workers, fellow refugees, kind people... -Adnan? -...you see it in their eyes. Empathy. So, how is your day going? I've had better. Is it hard, hard for you to visit The Jungle? It's harder for those who live here. This is good coffee. Can I ask you about your wife? -What do you want to know? -Where is she? I don't know. Sorry, I don't mean to be intrusive. It's okay. That's her, Bana. She's very beautiful. She's strong. -I'm sure she's fine. -I'll try and help you find her. If you want to see the imbalance of power in the world, look around this camp. We are forced to live on handouts. No white nations are living here as refugees. They hand out the food, then they go home. An aid worker asked me why I want to reach the UK. I don't. I want to go home. I ask her... "When your home is no longer safe, where would you go? What would you do and why?" Hey Adnan, it's me, Mima. I made it over. I crossed on the train. I have left some Euros in my jeans. I want you to have it. God willing, you will join me in the UK, my brother. Take care. Jane tried to contact me two days later, she texted me. She thought she had news on Bana. I waited by the Wi-Fi hill to hear from her. How are you, my friend? Where is she? Huh? Where is she? This is very good. This is very good, my friend. At least you know she's safe. At least you know she's safe. This is very good news, my friend. Now all you have to do is join her. Huh? All you have to do is join her now. Let's take a selfie to celebrate this day, huh, - to remember it, huh. - Okay. Let's take one with my phone. Okay. Very good news, my friend. Hello. Adnan? Oh, my god. I've been trying to contact you. I'm sorry it took so long. They made me register for asylum. My papers are going through. I miss you, Adnan. I miss you so much. That is the only good thing about The Jungle. The people... the hope that others can give you. One man gave me a lift in the rain. A photographer from the UK. When you're feeling low... a kind gesture, no matter how small... is sometimes all you need to restore your faith with humanity. You know, I wish I could be a bird... so I can go anywhere I want to without passport, money. Just to be free. You know, it's only 26 miles away from here. We can swim it. Yeah. I can't swim. - Listen, Adnan. - Hmm? I think tomorrow the best thing to do is I'll go in and you will be the lookout, okay? Trust me, we'll be fine. I'll be like a rabbit, no one sees me coming. Adnan. Hello, Adnan. -No problem. Yes, yes, yes. -Okay, good. Good. -Hurry up, my brother, please. -Yeah, yeah. Okay. Oh, shit. Come on, Yousef. Yousef, Yousef, Yousef. I hate dealing with the traffickers. They reduce life to nothing... a transaction. Where the strong... expose the weak. When we robbed the traffickers, we came away with 2,000 Euros. The plan was for Yousef to arrange a crossing with someone he knew in Dunkirk. We arranged to meet at 10 p.m. by the supermarket. I went back to The Jungle to pack and say goodbye to my friends. -Where is Adnan? -Who is that? -I don't know. -Don't lie to me. -Where is he? -Don't know, don't know. Sami, is looking for you. -I tried to reach you. -I think I lost my phone. Yousef! Fuck! Come on. Yousef. Yousef. Yousef. Oh, god. Fuck. -Fuck. -You need to sit. Fuck. Let's go, man. We have to go. Mima told me that when his boat sank in the Mediterranean Sea, it sank right on the Libyan border. The Italian coast guards were a few hundred meters away. But because the sinking boat was on Libyan waters... the Italians didn't move. They held their ground. They sat and watched the boat sink. Watched those who couldn't swim drown. A few hundred meters away. Only the strong swimmers made it. How could anyone do that? Look and watch while people die. Rules, regulations. Red tape. I suppose they saw the boats every day. It must get to the point where you no longer see the people. How else do you explain it? We have an abandoned truck under a motorway bridge. Passengers have been left on board. One fatality. All units in the area of Barton's Bridge, Warwick Road, seal off this junction, between Queens Highway. Fatality appears to be from a stab wound to the right leg. We also need ambulances to be sent as soon as possible. We have several passengers in a critical condition, repeat, send right away, over. Divert to junction nine on the M62, over. Okay, roger that. The lottery of life decides your passport. No national boundaries can stop the love that exists between two people. They will be together, no matter what. Or they die trying. In another life, I was a teacher. Now I'm a refugee. A Syrian. My name is Adnan.
