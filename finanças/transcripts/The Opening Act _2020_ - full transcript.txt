Most movies... You ever talk about a movie with someone that happens to have read the book? They're always so condescending. "Oh, the book was much better." "Oh, really? What I enjoyed about the movie... no reading." I'm thinking about getting a pet. I'mma get a dog. You know, that's what I'mma get. I don't like cats. I don't... Cats don't do anything. They don't... They don't have any responsibilities. No, really, come on, you never heard of a guard cat. Or a bomb-sniffing cat. Or a seeing-eye cat. Pop Tarts... Can there be a simpler food item? Directions on Pop Tarts. Like, if they weren't there, would somebody, like, put the box down? "What? I... How do I get that goodness in me?" I told my mother when I was 14 I wanted to be a comedian. And she said, "Oh, maybe it's better if you just die." I like Italian delis. There's just no options. It just says sandwich. And there's a guy in there cutting the meat. "It's going to be good." You know, when you get older, you don't know you older because the old stuff just happen to you. Like, you be pouring cereal and your knee will go out. You'll go, "Oh." I was bullied when I was a little kid. I was bullied when I was in school for being Asian-American. The biggest problem with that is that I am not Asian-American. I feel like I'm a reasonably intelligent human being. And I'd say it probably took me about six years was just William with dots in it. Anyone else have that same... I feel like half of you right now are like, "Oh, my God. It's William with dots in it." It's the little things we miss. Emcee: Alright, guys, we're gonna keep the comedy rolling here. But just reminder, we got 25-cent wings for the next 30 minutes and beer buckets till 10:00. Next up is one of my favorites here at the open mic. Put your hands together for Will Chu. Every time I go to a Chinese restaurant, this is what all of my friends do to me. They're like, "Will, Will, order in Mandarin. It's gonna sound hilarious. Order in Mandarin, bro. They got to hook it up." I'm like, "Bro, we're in Panda Express. Her name tag says Consuela on it. I don't think that's a Mandarin name. Like, what do you expect, if I order in Mandarin some ninja's going to pop up from behind the kitchens just like, 'Poof, here's your Kung Pao panda penis'"? You know? I took this tall girl to a concert, right? I couldn't see anything, so I was miserable. I couldn't see anything. So I just looked up at her. I'm like, "Hey, pick me up." People are using their phone for everything except as a phone. You have to text now. I was okay with emojis because it used to be yellow. And I was pretty okay with that. It should just stay that way. Now they have like five shades of different colors, right? It's confusing. I was trying to text my black friend a thumbs up. I wasn't sure if I should text him my thumbs up or his thumbs up. I never texted him back. Thank you, guys, that's my time. I'm Will Chu. Keep it going. Yeah. Good job. Thank you for waiting it out. I got some jokes for you. You ever notice how long a giraffe's neck is? - Yeah? - Giraffe scarfs. Sore throats. You use that. It's cute. I'll... I'll try it out. Oh, God, I'm full. Thanks for coming. - Hey, Quinn. - Dude. Dude, love your bringer. What retirement home did you get him from? It's gotten so bad I have to invite my neighbors. I'm so sick of asking people to pay to come watch me. I wish I was doing "The Tonight Show," but you gotta keep working to take a bigger shot. - And here we are. - Emcee: Show him some love. Watch me destroy. What's up, what's up, what's up? Make some noise. Keep it going for Will. Your bringer didn't pay his tab. Are you serious? Yeah. And don't run the light again. ...Asian doctor. I've never seen an Asian vet. How was school? Getting them to dissect frogs was fun. Getting them to wash their hands was not. Yo, that's my ranch, right? Yes. They asked if you wanted a side of ranch and you said no, right? Yes. Then why are you using my ranch? I knew you would get a side of ranch so I didn't have to. You are frugal. Like a old Chinese woman. Speaking of which, I ordered us the 42-ounce bag of Cool Ranch Doritos. Why didn't you just buy four 10-ounce bags? - How is that a fun Instagram? - Doing it for the Gram. Mm-hmm. Hey, I just want to say I really enjoy my time with you. You make me laugh. It's nice to know we're moving forward together. I agree. Not only are you gorgeous, but I love that you eat like an eighth grader. - Comedy Cellar. - Hi. I'm calling in regards to auditioning to becoming a regular. You have to have two recommendations from two existing regulars. Who are they? - Two existing? - Look, I got to go. Hello? Hello? Hey, Gary, can I borrow a pen? Boom. What's going on with that windshield claim? I was trying to wrap it up. Wrong. Do or do not. There is no... - T-There is no...? - There is no try. Try. Yoda. "Empire Strikes Back." Looking good there, Gary. Yeah. Getting dirty today. I love it. I just got a six-car pileup in from Indy. It's a mess. It's a mess. So that's been expedited, which means you're getting it expedited. So I'm going to need these folders ASAP. Oh, and, Will, remember I want all this stuff in Times New Roman at 14 point. I'm trying to get my set ready to audition. - Right. So, what's your plan? - I don't know. It's hard to get stage time with no credits. I've been looking for options other than Mickey's. There just hasn't been anything. Sorry, Quinn is texting me. He's at the open mic and he said it's packed. It's packed? You should go. Here you go. Thanks. Oh, great choice. This is my favorite bear. It's nice to see someone happy at work. You know, when I think about my job, the only silver lining is I can't possibly hang myself in the cubicle. - Not funny. - Well, I thought about it. With three walls, you actually can't. - Hey. - Okay, but all I'm saying is I don't think my mother and father came here and sacrificed so I can end up shorting people on insurance claims. I want to be a working comic. Basically I look at the road ahead of me right now and it's in a cubicle selling things I don't believe in. I'd rather see my name on the marquee, something I can get excited about. And enjoy, you know? Something I'm proud of. Oh, for an additional $6, you can get this put in. $6? Does it have Bluetooth? I tell you, my girlfriend caught me the other day. Caught me the other... just, you know what, it's just... She just caught me. I'm secure about it. You just gotta keep your cool. Just do this, alright? "You're next, bitch. You like that? You like that?" Yes, and ladies, I know it's small. Joey. Joey. But it's how the pencil writes, bitch, alright? Mine can write in cursive, alright? Calligraphy. Hey. Thank you. So, Quinn wrote my name down earlier. When can I get on? Well, I'm not making any promises. Sometimes I think maybe you light me just a little early. Well, that's when it's not going well. That's how you can tell that. You're going to get a light at two minutes, and then you're going to get another light. And the second light means get off the stage. Can I go up soon? Keep it going for Quinn, y'all. Good set, Quinn. -Hey, thanks, pal. Hey. Oh, that was so good. Aren't you just the cutest little thing? Oh, well, this cute little thing is a big bad boy. With needs that are adult like a careless whisper - and some booze. - Okay. Do you boys want to come join us for '80s night at the Tavern? Oh, want to? Yeah. Dude, we'd love to. No, no, I got to hang out until my set. - But thanks. - Aww. What a card. Swipe left. Well, nice meeting you. Let's go sit. Are you fucking kidding me? Look at these two. Quinn, I got a girlfriend. Full disclosure, I can't close without you, okay? It's like wherever Laverne goes, Shirley follows. Dude, I need you. Okay, okay, I see where this is going. Why don't you just get one of the Joeys to be your wingman? Go fuck yourself. No, dude, those fucking jabronis? Look at that guy. Dude, dude, neither of them have money, and I'll end up paying for their drinks. Plus I'm pretty sure they do a lot of coke, which I can't afford. So please hang out with me for one beer. - Joey. - Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. - Hey Quinn. - Hey, dawg. Hey. Spot me a brewski? - Yeah, sure, dawg. Sure. - Oh, hey. You girls like blow? Would you rather drink a bucket of human feces or not? Which one would you choose? Hey, Mickey, what time is my... - Hey, Joey? - Hey, what's up, Joey? Hey, a Jew and an Italian go into business together. - Uh-oh. - Who loses? I don't know. Who? - The government. - Oh, come on. Hey, Mick, so when can I get on? I'm looking at this right now, and I don't see that anybody gave your name at the door. You know the deal. Two paying customers to see you, and then you get to do five minutes. Mickey, I'm running out of friends. Not my problem. I'll bring four people next week if you just give me a few minutes on stage. Will, if I make an exception for you, then I have to make an exception for everybody else that wanders in and goes, "I don't have any friends. - I don't have any friends." - Mickey, Mickey, I promise. Four people. Please. To you, this is a show. To me, this is a business. Please? No. You guys ready to rock? This microphone needs Viagra. What? What clubs have you played? Just open mics. You don't have any credits, I can't book you. I can't get credits if I can't get up. Jose. Can you turn down the music, please? Rockview Insurance, may I help you? No, I understand. Yes, Mr. Kominsky. Did you get me these pens? We have all the information we need. Okay, you want to talk to a supervisor? Yeah, that's not a problem. I never win. Don't stop. Don't stop? Believing. Hanford, California, Steven Perry... Journey. Round two of the sushi. Ciao. Yo, fuck faaaaaaaaaaaaaaa... wait for it... aace. Well, number one, go fuck yourself. The Joeys ruined everything, and now they owe me 85 bucks I'll never see again. I am headed up to Detroit to open up for Steven Gold. So that means I can't emcee the Pennsylvania Improv from tonight through Sunday. So the manager asked me if I could recommend a comic last minute. - I said you. He said great. - Oh, wow. This is a major opportunity, alright? If you kill it... Well, I got all these claims that I got to file. Chip Fontaine is a made man. He's the manager, and he books not only the Pennsylvania Improv, but 12 more clubs. He's also a chatty Kathy, and word will get out to all the other clubs. It's just like figure skating. It's a small world. Figure skating? Hey, you got your childhood, I got mine, okay? Dude, if Chip likes you, you're in the rotation and you go full-time. You take this weekend and you get started, you're on your way, man. - I just don't know if I'm ready. - Oh, I get it. No, you are horribly scared and terrified and you fear failure. I-I get it. I get it. I'm not scared. I said I'm not ready. There's a big difference. Okay? I don't wanna just take this opportunity and bomb. I was scared too, but ever since I took the big leap, even on my worst fucking day, I thank God I'm not selling anybody a 2012 Kia Sorento. Chances like this don't happen every day. If you don't take this shot, dude, you might as well quit stand-up and, like, remain in your cubicle and your living Geico commercial. And, well, I didn't tell you the best part. You'll never guess who's headlining. He's literally your favorite TV star of all time. There's one meaningful question. Have you reached your full potential? Don't... Don't think about it. Don't think about what the answer is, I'll tell you the answer. The answer is... Here are a pile of claims from the six-car pileup. Hey, my ace in the hole. I love it, I love it. Look, Barry, I got the work done so I would like to take tomorrow off. Will. Will, Will, Will, Will, Will. When you reach the end of your rope, you... Uh, what are you talking about? When you reach the end of your rope, you...? - You get more rope? - Wrong. When you reach the end of your rope, you tie it in a knot and you hang on. It's Thomas Jefferson. You should know that. I need to take tomorrow off. In our world, as you know, there are accidents. We don't control them, but we can control what we do about them. I'm not asking you, Barry. I'm taking tomorrow off. It's very important to me. Will, what's important to you is keeping your job. So let's turn the beat around, see you show up tomorrow with a little more passion on your face, and knock out some of those claims. Capiche? I won't be back tomorrow. I'm done. I quit. Wrong. I can't do that anymore, okay? Seriously, it's over. I'm done. I quit. Hey, if you think I'm giving you a good recommendation, you're crazy. Hey, cupcake. I'm 100% in. - In for what? - The gig this weekend. Oh, my God. Sorry, dude. I... You made it sound like you weren't coming. You gotta be kidding me, right? I wish you had called even just five minutes ago. I literally just booked the Joeys. Oh, my God. I'm getting physically sick to my stomach. This is going to absolutely cripple me. Quinn, do... do you know what I just did here? Dude, I'm sorry. I can't do this to you, man. Oh, my God. You think I'd book the fucking Joeys? Dude, I was just about to call you. Congrats. You're an asshole, Quinn. Yeah, an asshole who got you a fucking sweet gig. Look, I'll be in contact with the Pennsylvania Club. They'll put you up at the condo. Show time today. You better get moving. You are making the right call, buddy. Billy G? At an improv? That's a big deal. That's pretty good. Knock them dead. Kill them. Is that what you say? Break a leg. Big fan. Huge fan. Nice to meet you, Mr. G. Hi, I'm Will Chu. I'm your opening act. Oh, Billy. Oh, my God, it's so good to be here. I've been waiting all my life for this moment. What's up, Pennsylvania Improv? Hi. I'm Will. Will Chu. I'm the emcee. Actually, since we're talking names, my name is spelt C-H-U. Ah, so you asking me to run up on the ladder and change your name? Wondering, um, can I get the keys to the condo? Is the manager around? TT to Charlie Money. Yeah, Chip will be here in just a minute. Well, this is my house. I protect my house. Oh, hey. Must be Will. Chip. Nice to meet you. Thanks for having me. You can recommended, so if you want to make this more than a one-time thing, I'm going to need you to keep the crowd on track, handle the hecklers, and most importantly make the audience laugh. - Yeah. - Big laughs, okay? Got it. And thank you. I appreciate this weekend. Y-You don't know what it means to me. By the way, you're going to be sharing the condo this weekend with our feature, Chris Palmer. - Awesome. - Well, you say that now. Let's see how you feel on Sunday. Why is that? Look, Will, Chris is going to show you things that you can't unsee. And when he does, I want you to call me. I'm going to give you my number. If you need help or a shoulder to cry on, or even a place to stay, because Chris can get a little rowdy, I want you to reach out. Sure. Here. What's your number? No, I'll put it in. Here. That was easy, huh? Call me. Call me right now so I have your number. Oh. Yeah. Great. I'm vibrating. Must be you. Cool. So it begins. Hello? Hello? Whoa. Don't you fucking knock? What kind of a dickhole barges in somewhere like he owns the place, huh? Huh? I'm... fucking with you. What's up, man? You Will? Chris. How are you, bro? - Great to meet you. - Good, man. We're going to have a great weekend. Your first time here? First time in any real club. So I'm just a little bit nervous. Oh, no, no, no, no. Why? Did Chip start flirting with you? Oh, was that what it was? Yeah, yeah, just don't give him your number. You'll be fine. And over there's the hot tub. Just fucking around, there's no hot tub. Anyway, this is the condo. I took this bedroom, so the other one's yours, alright? Awesome. I'm gonna take a shower. You want to head to the club after that? Fuck yeah, Will. Fuck yes, I do. Hey, yo, don't use that shampoo by the way. Sometimes dudes jizz in it just to fuck with guys for the following week. - You serious? - Yeah. Hey, you ever been to the Warhol Museum? I've always wanted to check it out. Want to go tomorrow? Yeah, sure. Fuck yeah. Dibs first shower. Welcome to the world-famous Improv Thursday night. Make some noise. Who's ready for a great show tonight? Okay, just a reminder to keep your talking to a minimum and your laughter to a maximum. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be starting the show in just a few minutes. - Ooh, long time, Rachel. Hello. - Just letting you know we'd like you to turn your cellphones to silent. There's no video or flash photography during the show. Be sure to sign up for our e-mail list. The cards are on your tables. You okay, bro? Oh, yeah, yeah. I just... just a little nervous. That is like the biggest audience - I've ever performed for. - Dude, don't be nervous. Fuck those people out there. Just do you. - Chris. - Holy shit. I heard Chris. How you doing, man? - I'm good. - I'm still kind of hungover from the last time we chilled out. Oh, yeah, Ricky that's called a bender, my friend. Probably right. Yo, you still fucking with that cheerleader? The blonde one with the half-shaved head? God bless you, Chris. What up, man? I'm Ricky. I'm Will. I'm the emcee. I'm the sound guy, man. Cool. Alright, what kind of intro music you guys want? - Surprise me, bud. - What about you? Something by the Killers? Alright, cool. You know, Chip loves the Killers, man. You know what? Why don't you pick something? - Anything but the Killers. - You sure? - Yeah. Absolutely. - Alright. Cool. What do you want for your intro? You can say clubs and colleges. What clubs? Uh, what colleges? Um... So I'll just keep it plain and simple, just clubs and colleges. Gonna keep it broad, you know. Sounds good. Alright, listen, guys, Will, you're doing 12, Chris, you're doing 25. You get a two-minute light each, and it's a big red light right at the back of the wall. You can't miss it, alright? Is it that wall? Have a good show, y'all. Peace. - Love you, buddy. - Love you too, nigga. - Did he just call you... nigga? - I love it. What do you want for your intro? Oh, same just clubs and colleges. Which clubs and colleges have you done? Oh, let's see, I've done like 28 improvs, Funny Bones, and I did... I did the NACA Conference. That's like 30 colleges last year. - Good... Good for you. - Thank you very much. Thursday night, make some noise. Alright, buddy, here we go. Give it for your headliner this evening, Billy G. - To a great show. - To a great show. And your future act, Chris Palmer. Now, ladies and gentlemen, please give a Pennsylvania Improv welcome to your host and emcee for the evening. You know your opening act from clubs and colleges, please welcome Will Chu. What's up, Pennsylvania? How you guys doing? Alright. Awesome, awesome crowd tonight. Is everybody here from Pennsylvania? Awesome. Lot of pretty girls from Pennsylvania, am I right? Yeah, not... not here but in downtown, you know. You know, dating... dating is totally different now, right? Like, I know... I know where I stand. Like, I am... I'm, like, cute. I'm not like the macho guy. You know, I wish I could be that guy. Like, I'm really good looking... if you're into anime. That's the level that I'm at, you know? I can't even go to the beach with my shirt off, right? Like, look, don't get me wrong, ladies, I'm in shape, okay? But I'm just a small guy with really nice hair. So from the back, I look like a really hot Asian chick. And from the front, I look like a really hot Asian chick. Thank you guys. That's my time. I'm Will Chu. I will be your host tonight. Pennsylvania, are you guys ready for your next comedian? Alright, you've seen him at clubs and colleges. Let's give it up for Chris Palmer. What the fuck is up, Pennsylvania Improv? Make some fucking noise. Oh, my God. Fantastic. Let me... Anybody in here single? Anybody in here married? That is the first time the married people have ever been more enthusiastic. Well, good, so there's some good marriages in here? You guys? I heard you guys are... oh, he did this. He went like this. Not a good sign. Great. Are we ever going to see a good headline that starts with the words "a Florida man"? Hi. I'm Will, and I just want to say what an absolute honor it is to be working with you. And "Oh, Billy." I'm going to ask you not to do that, okay? Okay. Yes. Noted. About my intro. Just say "You know our headliner from his numerous appearances on 'The Tonight Show, ' his best-selling book that's for sale after the show on sale. I got you this time. Of course the TV show, 'Oh, That Billy.' Ladies and gentlemen, Billy G." You got it? - Write it down. - Yeah. "The Tonight Show," book on sale, I got you this time, "Oh, That Billy." I'm sorry. Can I borrow a pen? Thank you. Close that door on the way out. - Thank you so much. - Okay. You have to be careful these days with what you're watching on TV when you're talking to your lady. Okay? A little while back, I was dating a wonderful young lady. She called me on the phone and I picked it up, and after about a minute she goes, "Who the fuck is over at your apartment?" And I was like, "What are you talking about?" And she was like, "Somebody is screaming, somebody is moaning." I said, "Babe, I am watching singles ladies tennis. Maria Sharapova screams like a hyena when she plays. Thank God you didn't call me five minutes ago. I was watching mixed doubles. Would have sounded like a goddamn orgy in here." Fantastic. That's fucking right. Hey, deejay, kick that track. Guys, I'm gonna be selling merch back there. The T-shirts say "Getting Chrissy with it." And a couple of you will have the great souvenir of actually getting Chrissy with it. Thank you very much, good night. One more time for Chris Palmer, ladies and gentlemen. Pennsylvania, you guys ready for your headliner? You've seen him on his numerous appearances on "Oh, That Billy." And, uh, his book... best-selling book is for sale after the show, "The Tonight Show." And, um... And... And of course you know him from his TV show, "I Got You This Time." Let's give it up for Billy G. Couldn't find that pen, huh? What's up, Pennsylvania? How you doing? One, two, three... "Oh, Billy." "Oh, Billy." I was born Billiard Goulet... Those two right there, please. And papa was a rolling stone, was he not? Everybody goes, "Why go by Billy G?" And I said, "If your name was Billiard, wouldn't you?" Nobody wants to be behind the 9 ball... Will, let's go get a drink, buddy. - Well, I'm watching Billy. - Oh, I know. We're not going to leave the club or anything. We're just going to watch him from the back there. Trust me, you're going to be sick of his act by Sunday too. You got kids? I got kids all different ages, man. I got one daughter who just got out of college. And you can applause for that. She didn't... She didn't graduate or anything. She just got out. Oh, my God. Holy shit, you killed it, Chris. You too. That fucking elevator bit's a killer. You know, they do sexting. I tried to do that with my girl, you know? I'll try sexting her. I said the other day, I was like, "Hey, baby, what's up?" You know? "Daddy about to pull up," you know? "I might want to...." She texts me back, "Pick up some bread." Hey, Chrissy, I got Billy G doing four radio stations tomorrow. But one station still wants a comic for their Friday funnies. So I need you to get up at 7:00 AM and do press for me. 7:00 AM? Yeah, if you want to keep working at my club, yeah. Can I bring Will? Yeah, if that helps you get up for a 7:00 AM wake up. Sure. Ricky will pick you up. Will, I got my eyes and ears on you. See you at 7:00 AM. - I've never done radio before. - Don't worry about it. It's easy. You just do a joke or two from your act. Piece of cake. Oh, we're in business, buddy. Hello. Excuse me, I'm here to redeem my coupon. Good for one free drink with a comedian. - Hope it's good for two. - Take a look at that. Yes, it is. Not valid in Hawaii or Alaska. I'm Chris. This is my friend Will. - You guys were so funny. - Like, we're dead. Like sick funny, like we're not alive, yeah. And I tell you what, my own son, on a count of three, he came off the breast and he said... "Oh, Billy.," "Oh, Billy." Hey, that's my time, guys. Thank you, Pennsylvania. Oh, Billy, you killed it tonight. "Oh, Billy." Bro, it is time for the night shift to begin. We, and I mean we, are heading next door to the pub. But don't we have radio first thing in the morning tomorrow? I mean, maybe we should stay fresh and just kind of chill. Dude, did you just rock your first fucking improv? - I think so. - Yeah, you did. Oh, my God, you are, like, so hilarious. So I think we should take a victory lap. Besides, you'd be the first comic I've ever met who wants to go to bed after a great set. Aren't you fucking wired, bro? - A little bit. - A little bit? And, like, comedy, like, for me, like, I'm just going to say, like, I've never even noticed, but comedy is, like, so funny. That's a fantastic observation. These two are very astute. Okay, okay, I kind of just want to talk to Billy for a little bit. Suit yourself. Meet me there, okay? - Hold my hand. - Yes, you got it. Hey, you. How's things? Well, the condo makes my place look like the Four Seasons. That nice, huh? How'd your set go? - I'm still standing. - Give me more. - How's Billy G? - Oh, boy. What? I messed up his intro tonight. I'm going to fix it. I don't know, I don't want to talk about it right now. You'll get it right tomorrow. I still don't want to talk about it. You know? It's just kind of fresh and painful right now. - How are you? - Good. Good. Long day, but still have to finish my lesson plan and grade 32 book reports on "Oh, the Places You'll Go." And throw away 18 macaroni necklaces that have been in my car for three weeks. Nice. You can make mac and cheese out of those. Look, I'm going to head to bed. - Love you. - I love you. Oh, sorry. - Hey. - Here he is. Let's get to work, dude. So just a heads up, I actually have a girl back home. Oh, you know what? Just a heads up, so do I, yeah. Back in Miami. And Indy, Toledo, and Austin. And I've got one right out there too. Mm. Just keep her friend busy for me, okay? That's all I ask. Just be a wingman. Come on. Come on, buddy. How long were you going to make me wait? Oh, I'm sorry, are we having our first fight? - Are we married? - Mm-hmm. I love a guy that can make me laugh. Oh, okay, okay. So actually, I have a girlfriend. That's cool. I have a boyfriend. Thanks, I'm okay. Got you. Not the kissing kind. Oh, okay. That is my cue to exit. Nice meeting you. Bye-bye. Megan. Megan. Hey, shy guy. Where are all the party peoples? Whoo! Will, I'm so sorry to do this. Can you actually make sure Sophie gets home okay? She's way too wasted to take a cab by herself. Oh, and shit, that was funny on stage before with the jokes, so good... good job. You're the best, bud. Second best. He's the best. Where is everyone? Hi. Hello. Hello. So, where to, kids? Where do you live? Um, um, um, um, 267 Wildwood Lane. 267 Wildwood Lane, and we're coming right back here. - So two stops. - We're coming right back here. - Wildwood Lanes. - Whoo! That's a bit of a trip. I'm going to need cash up front. Going to need cash up front. - What? - Yeah. That's what the man said. Más, cabron. - Are you fucking kidding me? - Yeah, más means more. Más. More. Come on, let's go. Let's go! How far are we? Are you sure this is where you live? What even is time? Are we on a dirt road? Okay, looks like, uh, this is it. This place is weird, man. Oh, I'm home. Come on in. No, no, no, I got an early thing tomorrow in the morning. Come on. Hungry? - I have Hot Pockets. - No, no, no, no thanks. Oh, my God. Okay. I got it. Okay. She... Shit. Shit. Okay, I'm just going to help her in. I'll be right back. I have a bad feeling about this. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Getting some bad vibes around here. Stay right here. I'll be right back. My knight in shining armor. No, no, no, come on. Hey, where you going? Fuck, he has my phone. Yes, 267 Wildwood Lanes, okay? - I need to get out of here. - Happy new year! So if anybody can come get me in just under 45 minutes, I'll pay them double, okay? Okay? Haven't seen my phone, have you? Unh-unh. Damn it. You really packing some heat there, huh? Yeah. No, I'm just talking about the guns, but... Yeah. Give me that dick. Psyche. It's not even loaded. - But you are. - Shut up. Just a little. I really need to get out of here. Promise I won't tell anybody. You know what, no, no, I-I've asked you nicely already. Okay, let's just... Holy shit. - What? - My boyfriend's here. - What? - He'll kill you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. Bye. Baby. Somebody call? A really dirty girl? That pussy better be as tight as it was when I left this morning. Christ. That was a long-ass day. 10 hours of non-stop bullshit. I need it. Let's lock and load. I'm on it. Let's do it. Oh, yes. Yes. Oh, God, yes. Oh, baby. Could have been you. What? C-Could you have been you. Like... like, um, like the 50 Cent song because you love 50 and I love 50. And that's just what I always think about when I'm taking care of my man. Oh, baby. Let's get horizontal, then tomorrow Red Lobster. Yay! Get up here. Sorry about that, man. I was a bit creeped out back there. - This is yours. - Holy shit, thank you. Don't thank me. Thank your friend Chip. He called you like 12 times on the phone. - Chip. - Come on, let's go, man. I've got radio in the morning. Yeah, and I'm Jeff Gordon. I'm sorry you had to see this, but a gal's gotta have her beauty routine. Don't look at me, I'm hideous. Night, Chris. Love you, bud. Where's my little guy? Where's my little guy? Will, it's radio time. Come on, you sweet little pea pea. Let's do it. The cop was there the whole time. And it was insane. Just staring. And... Holy shit, dude, that is a crazy story. I'm sorry I left you with her, but that's fucking funny. Fuck you, Chris. Hey, yo, I got to stay back here but I got to handle some shit, alright? Alright. Chris, hey. Hey, baby. Randy's psyched to have you back on the show, man. - We all are. - Thank you. I haven't seeing you since... Oh, my God, last time I saw you, did you end up hooking up with that blonde? - Blonde? - The doctor, the blonde, the hot-ass blonde. - Not sure I remember. - You don't re... Jesus Christ, I'd remember her for the rest of my life. - Who is this? - Oh, this is Will. He is emceeing this weekend. Super funny guy. Is there room for him? Yeah. You got to share a mic, though. It's alright. And we're back from the break, y'alls guys. Our next guest can be seen yuk-yuking it up this weeked at the Pennsylvania Improv with headliner Billy G. For WGHS's Friday funnies sponsored by Kirby's Donuts, please welcome my good buddy Chris Palmer and... Will. Will Chu. Welcome to the Morning Zoo, fellas. Oh, you know, Randy let me just say from the bottom of my heart, you're welcome. Well, Chris, last time you were in town, I went and saw your set. It was hilarious. The ladies really dig this guy. - We love him. - Thank you again. You know, when I came back from that show, I was telling these guys about your Florida bit, and I was hoping you would grace us with it. For you, anything. Yeah, Florida man, so Florida man, are we ever going to see a headline that's good that has the phrase "a Florida man"? You guys know what I'm talking about? It's always "a Florida man claims his wife was kidnapped by holograms." Or "a Florida man set fire to his apartment complex because his landlord told him to stop masturbating in front his windows." I mean, what's next? "A Florida man saves another Florida man from a Florida man"? Love it, love it. I love it. Did you guys know that Ponce de Leon discovered Florida? So he was looking for the fountain of youth, and I don't know if you guys have been to Florida lately, but it's not definitely not in Florida. So, uh, Will, what's going on in your world? Oh, well, this guy had a little adventure last night, right, pal? I don't think I want to talk... Come on, it's live radio. Give us something, buddy. - Dish. - Have at it. I ended up in a cab with a very nice young lady last night. And she was trying to hook up with me. But I have a girlfriend back... Uh-oh. - And then what happened? So I jumped out of a window of her trailer because her boyfriend pulled up and he was a police officer. And let's just say he really knows how to blow off some steam. Like, he... he knows how to blow off some steam. We heard it. Okay, Will, this is the Friday funnies. Why don't you try giving us something funny? Okay, so I'm from Ohio. - Boo. - Come on. - Originally I was from Kansas. - That's not funny either. Alright, let's check in with Bill and hear about this weekend's weather. Okay, this weekend's forecast, going to be a good one, Zoo Crew. - Friday... - What am I looking at here? 'Cause I want to be prepared. Alright, Friday is sunny with a high of 70 degrees. Whoo, cotton T's, capri pants, open-toed sandals, ladies SPF15. Saturday is sunny with a high of 76 degrees. Tank top, cut-offs, flip-flops, SPF30. And Sunday, we got a high of 82 degrees. I'm calling sports bra, no bottoms, barefoot, SPF50. - You rock, Bill. - No, Val, you rock. What's the news? - Huey Lewis. - Huey Lewis. Back to you, Randy. Alright, as you know, Friday funnies is brought to you by Kirby's Donuts and I love them. We all do. Stop by and see them. And as a matter of fact, during the next break I will finally sink my teeth into that éclair that I've been eying for the past 45 minutes. Big thanks to Kirby's Donuts. And a big thanks to Chris and Willie from the Improv. Go see them this weekend. They're performing with Billy G. We will be right back. Boom. Alright. Hey, thanks for coming in, fellas. Alright. What the fuck? Did you eat my éclair? Yes. I'm... I'm... I'm sorry I didn't know it was yours. I can just go get another one. Like... Like, do you want me to go get another one for you? Hey, thanks for coming in, Chris. Always good to see you, buddy. Was it at Wrigley's Donuts? I'm so sorry. I really didn't... - Hey, other comic. - You're on a roll, my friend. - Dude. - Whoa. You had chocolate on your face the whole time he was yelling at you. They got a picture of it online too, dawg. What? Oh, come... That is uncalled for. - Oh, nice. - Yeah. I could look at this all day. Let's get out of here, man. - Okay. - Yeah, of course. - Dude, we got you. - Hey guys. I love Chris Palmer. Great comic, great comic. Comes in, funny. Just funny. I mean, I love everyone. I'll give anyone a shot. Some guys just don't get it. Some guys just don't know the game. - Who? - Who? That douche, that open mic douche. Walt, Willie, Wally, whatever his name was. - Who cares. - He comes in here... - Not funny. - Unh-unh. - Can you just turn that down? - Sure, sure. So he comes in here, stinks up the place with a horrible joke. Every time he talked, it was just, "Ugh, who cares?" You know, he's got no future in comedy. No charisma. Chris has charisma. And then... Okay, maybe just change the channel. - Yeah, of course. - Course. He ate the only thing I wanted in that box of donuts. I looked forward to it all week. And that little bitch ate it. He ate it. His jokes ate it. His jokes stunk. Stink, stank, stunk. - It smells so bad in here. - I feel sick. So if you want to see a great show this weekend at the Improv, go see Billy G and Chris Palmer. But if the show starts at 8:00, show up at at 8:15 after that "comedian" is done. - Ugh. - With his awful comedy. Or if you do show up, matter of fact, if you do show up, boo him. You know why? Because Ohio sucks. Boo that pig from Ohio that ate my goddamn éclair. - Boo. Boo him. - Boo. Checking traffic... Ohhh. Oh, shit. Chris, thanks for waking up early to do press. - Sure thing. - Will. You're on a short leash. Well, I-I didn't know he was going to get... That was live on the radio. The whole city heard it. This is my business. And you made my business look really bad. Well, I thought maybe I was just making myself - look really bad and... - And you're working at my club, hence my club looks bad. That's strike one, Will. That was pretty bad, huh? Eh, just have some great sets. He'll get over it. You think so? Eh, 50/50. Whew. Lunch, Willy boy. My treat, baby. So, look, want to go into the city tomorrow and hit up that Warhol Museum? Yeah, sure. My God. So there's coleslaw and fries inside of the sandwich? How did you find this place? Well, when you're on the road 40 weeks a year, you get to know the spots. Philly, Geno's cheese steaks. Cinci, Skyline chilli. D.C., Ben's Chili Bowl. San Jose, Original Joe's. Plus there's a lot of ass in here. - She is so hot. - I think she can hear you. Oh, I hope so. How about you? How do you write? Well, I think of something that I think is funny, and then I go on stage and I talk about it. And then I talk until they laugh. - That's it. Easy. - That's brave. I-I don't know if I can trust myself that much. I need to plan everything out. Well, look, I got three weeks left on the road, and then I am moving to L.A., baby. - L.A.? - Mm-hmm. Why not New York City? So you make 50 bucks a show emceeing. And then you're going to emcee for a few years to build your way up to featuring like me. And then you do that for a few years, making a 100 bucks a show, which is still shit money. And then you're going to want to headline to make the big bucks, right? Well, nobody's going to book you to headline unless you've got a TV credit. And you don't get a TV credit unless you go to New York or L.A. And L.A. has sunshine. Plus L.A.'s the big show, okay? And I'm ready for it. Get me an agent, be seen, kill it. Then you got fuck you money. It's mailbox money, okay? You get a Lambo, pussy all the time. That's it. What about you? What's your plan? I just recently went all in on stand-up. So that's why this weekend is so important to me. I'm hoping Chip will book me again. Hey, ever work with Billy G before? Once, a long time ago. Look, I liked that dude when I was a kid, but he hasn't done shit in what, 15 years? Well, I think he's incredible. Look, Will, I get it. He's done shit. Great. He's yesterday. We are tomorrow. But he's accomplished what every comic wants. He has an hour special that everybody can quote. He has a TV show that runs 24 hours a day. The guy's a TV star. Was a TV star. Well, he's still an idol of mine. Holy cow, what is it? Planet of the eights in here? See what I did with the title of the movie? Yeah, that's "Planet of the Apes," - planet of the eights. - Uh-huh. - Yeah, that's a good one. - He got it. William, last night, I went to my favorite late-night noodle spot. And I must have butt dialed you five or six times. I-I didn't even notice. You didn't notice that I called you 6, 8, 12 times? Well, I, like, lost my phone for a while. My cat, Tchaikovsky, died. Have a great show. Thank you. Friday night, let me hear you. Who's ready for a great show tonight? It's called duck l'orange. I'll let you make it for me sometime. I'm fucking around. I'll make it for you. Yo, there's my guy. Hey, buddy. Two shows tonight. Let's kill it. I think maybe I should wait until the second show. It's your first weekend, bud. Let's do this. Boom. Mm. Alrighty. Love it. Show your love for your emcee for the night. He does clubs and colleges all over the city. Put your hands together for Will Chu. Hey. What's up, Pennsylvania? How you guys doing tonight? Awesome. What a beautiful crowd, right? I see a lot of pretty girls here in Pennsylvania. Not really here but, like, in downtown, so... But you guys are okay. You guys are okay. But I think there's one thing we can all agree on, right? - Ohio sucks. - What? Friday funnies. That was a good one. Alright, let's try this one more time. I think, as I was saying, I think there's one thing we can all agree on, is dating. Dating is just a little different now, right? Everybody made it out of their cubicle. Hey, Billy. It was awesome watching your set last night. You know that bit about your kids and breastfeeding? That's one of my all-time favorite bits. Thanks. So, hey, um, I was just wondering, tomorrow can I maybe take you out for lunch and just ask you for some advice? You know, like, about stand-up? "Tonight Show," book for sale after the show, "I got you this time," "Oh, That Billy." Thanks. Anybody do some day drinking today? The dude passed out in the back, that's my kind of day drinker. - Hell yeah. - Hey, what's up, man? - Hey, man. - You hanging after the show? - Sure. - Cool. You smoke? - Not really. - Blow? Definitely not. Alright. Try and go to a strip club? - It's not really my speed. - Oh, you pop pills? Ricky, I feel like I'm not a great hang for you. - I'll break you. - Sir, are you guys married? Yep, you don't seem too sure, okay. Hell yeah, Pennsylvania, you guys are dirty as shit, and I love it. Give it up for yourselves, everybody. Yeah. Deejay, kick that jam one more time. Peace you all. Love you. One more time, Chris Palmer, ladies and gentlemen. I can't go to a Chinese restaurant with white people anymore. No, seriously, every time I go to the Chinese restaurant it's... wait, hang on, hang on. Is she... She's seriously on her phone right now. Do you guys see this? Hello? Miss, that's got to be an important phone call. Hang on a minute. Who are you talking to? Who you... Let me get that. Hang on, hang on. Hang on. Hello, sir. I'm assuming it's a sir. No, it's not. Oh, hey, ma'am, how are you? Who is this? This is a comedian that you don't know about. Does your friend have a boyfriend? Yeah, his name is Tim. - And what's your name, sir? - Hank. - Ohhh. Who is Hank? - Who is Hank? Who is Hank? I don't know. Erica is sitting next to a handsome man named Hank. Is she married? Like, should somebody know about this? This getting scandalous, guys. Alright, Pennsylvania Improv, are you guys ready for your headliner? Okay, you've seen him in his numerous appearances on "The Tonight Show," and you read his book, the national best-seller, "I Got You This Time." And of course you know him for his own television show, "Oh, That Billy." Let's give it up for Billy G! - Alright, enjoy that book now. - Trust me, - you can't afford me. - Okay. I would come and strip for your friend, but it ain't going to happen. It's too steep. Hey, Will, come here a second. I'll catch up with you guys. - Yes, sir? - Lunch tomorrow. - Seriously? - Dougherty's at noon. Absolutely. I will... I'll be there. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, noon. - It's a date. No, it's just food and conversation. - It's not a date. - Sorry, that was stupid. It's not a date. But I'll see you there. Seriously, he said lunch tomorrow. Cool. Will, every weekend, God willing, one of your shows will have a bachelorette party. - Will, I'm fucking again. - Good for you. Thank you. Alright, I can do that to you. Alright, see you, bud. Will, where the fuck you been, man? - Right here. - Anyhoo, I'm about to go to Slappy's Mess and the strip club. - You trying to roll? - I'm good. You want some ecstasy? - Is everything okay back home? - I'mma hug you now. Okay. Thank you. Doing the, uh, Siberian tiger thing. You read about this? Mmm. One meal a day. It's supposed to simulate what they do. Love you, bud. Pick up. Hey, Billy. Let me ask you something. Why do you want to do this? I grew up watching stand-up. My dad loves stand-up. And that's all we did. You know some kids, like, they bond with their dads watching baseball, basketball? We watched stand-up. We watched Eddie Murphy, we watched you, we watched Billy G. Like, when I was 8 years old, that was, like, my shit, man. - Yeah. - And, I mean, I've always wanted to be a stand-up. I just... I just love it. How much you work a night? I do like a 12-minute set. 12 minutes? That's it? So how much time do you think that the people who come see our shows work? Every week? What do you think they work a day? - Eight hours a day? - Eight hours. - Yeah. - Five days a week. Alright, so now do you think that you deserve a shot before you go and do 12 minutes? When somebody's been working all week? If you put it that way, no, I guess not. No, you do not deserve a shot. You want to be a party guy, turn up, as the kids say... that's what y'all say, right? "I'm going to turn up." And that's fine. You know, some people come down, that's all they want to do is have a good time, hang out in the green room, get laid, you know? And eat some Cheetos. But you got to respect that audience. Do your job first. Mmm. This alright, right here, man. You ever had some of this? Taste that. Take a little bite here. See, get that up in you. - Mmm. - What? - Oh, my God. - Yeah. Do you have any advice for, like, a young comic? Like, what should I be doing? I'mma tell you two things. - Write it down. - Okay. Be... funny. Funny. I'm fucking with you, man. - I wrote it down. - I'm fucking with you. Okay, look, no, but for real. Two things. Write and get on stage. - That's it? - That's it. Yeah, I'm actually working on this bit. So it's about... Look, I don't want to hear about your bits. I don't want to hear about your bits. Good for you. You got a new bit, great. Keep working on it. Work it out. But don't... don't tell me about no bits. Okay. So you want to know when do you become a comic? Most young kids, they believe it's about when they a headliner, right? Even being a headliner don't mean you a comic. When you find your own point of view, get your own voice, get selfish with that shit. Get... Say stuff that means something to you on the inside and make you laugh. Larry the Cable Guy. Gaffigan. Chris Rock. Katt Williams. When I say these names, you can already envision - their audience, right? - Mm-hmm. That's 'cause they talking to their audience. They audience find them. That's what you got to do. Find your voice. You find your voice, your audience will find you. And that's when you're a comedian. What about you? The funny thing is when I first started this, I used to think that I had to make them laugh so that I could feel good. But over time, I realized that I make them laugh so that they feel good. It's the best job in the world. Give you one other thing real quick. Write this down. Billy is leaving. Yeah. Willy boy. What's up, bro? I'm working out this new joke tonight. So I just want to run it over a couple... Yeah, don't try out new jokes on a Saturday, bud. Do that Sunday or Thursday, not tonight. Good evening, and welcome to the world-famous Improv. Saturday night, make some noise. I said, Saturday night, make some noise. Now, please welcome to the stage your emcee for the night. He does clubs and colleges. Put your hands together for Will Chu. Hey, what's up? What's up, Pennsylvania? How you guys doing? Alright. Are we having fun tonight? Are you guys ready for some comedy? Alright. I see a lot of pretty girls here in Pennsylvania, right? Am I right? Yeah. Not really here but, like, in downtown, you know? Ohio sucks. Ohio sucks. Alright, oh, geez. Sorry. Hello? Alright, Pennsylvania, you guys ready to have some fun? Okay, I want to talk about myself tonight. And my... my... my father... Actually, my... my... my girlfriend... so I have a girlfriend. She's a teacher. And most people they... they usually say teachers are underpaid, right? But I think they're actually overpaid. That's a joke obviously. I don't... I don't... I'm not getting political here or anything. You know, my... my... my girlfriend called me out. I've been a little bit of a bummer lately. And so she said if I was a city, I would be like Seattle. It's... You know, it's... it's, like, rainy and it's dark. And it just... Well, so I was thinking about this. I'm like, "Okay, what if I was to upgrade to a city? What city would I upgrade to, right? If it's not for Seattle, then maybe I can upgrade to Flint, Michigan." - That's... - What the fuck is he doing? - He's dying. - Or, you know, what if I really upgrade, like I-I-I hit it big, and... and then I make it to, I don't know, like, uh... like Cleveland, right? Ohio. I wish you would go back to Cleveland. Even Flint. Okay. Actually, this weekend, I-I was going to go to Columbus with my girlfriend. You should go meet her right now. Please. Just... Just head there now. Well, let's... Light him. Light him. Where... Where is it? Here? I'm doing it. Are you guys ready for your next comedian? Okay. What the fuck happened? - I am so sorry. - On a Saturday night? I was just trying to get personal with my mat... Don't get per... What... It's not "Dr. Phil." That's your second strike. You know what happens on the third. - It won't happen again. - Yeah, it certainly won't. Because I'm cutting your time on the next show. You're getting five minutes, that's it, and bring up the guest spot. Got it. Fuck. - Yo, thanks, man. Thanks. - Alright, how you doing, man? - Big fan. - Thank you guys for coming out. - Sorry. - Whoa. Thanks for the flashback, my man. Well, you told me to write more about myself so I just thought, you know... Yeah. I also said be funny. - Jesus. - You're the emcee, you know? Supposed to warm the place up, you know? Yeah, but I never dealt with hecklers. Do a little crowd work or something. I don't know if I'm that good with crowd work yet. What about the other night? The lady with the phone. That was funny. Well, that actually happened, so I was just kind of reacting. Exactly. Crowd work. Reacting. Hey, Will, come here. Sorry. Hey, guys, how are you? Brooke Bailey... she's going to run her "Tonight Show" set for next week. Don't fuck up her intro too, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Wow, "Tonight Show," congrats. I'm Will. - Hi. Brooke. - Nice to meet you. You too. So is there anything you want me to say for your intro? You can just say the Comedy Cavalcade Tour and then I'm doing "The Tonight Show" - on Thursday. - Okay, cool. Finally sold two fucking T-shirts. Making it rain, baby. Holy shit. - Brooke, what's going on? - Hi. How's it going? - So, you doing time? - I am doing time. She's doing "The Tonight Show" on Thursday. What? Then we got to celebrate. - Oh, wow. - Ohh! The lovely Miss Bailey. - How are you? - Good to see you. Oh, goodness. Heard you got "The Tonight Show." - Yeah. - I called Jimmy, alright? - I told him to take care of you. - You're the best. - Thank you. - Well, I mean, you deserve it. You're talented. You work hard. Come on. Like I told you, I said first thing first... No, what you would always say to me is don't write down jokes in your phone. Always write it on a piece of paper with a pen because it makes it more personal. Doing your thing, super talented. You deserve this. Put your hands together for Will Chu. What's up? Packed house tonight on a Saturday. A lot of pretty girls in Pennsylvania, am I right? Look at them. Ohio sucks. Ohio sucks. Ohio sucks. Okay. How are you guys doing? Mother and daughter? Yeah. - Where's... Where's Dad? - Oh, he's not with us. Okay. Is he, like, fishing? Or bowling? He's dead. Ohio sucks. Nice, uh, pretzels, right? - He is not funny. - Not at all. Father and daughter. Father and son, right? That's cool. Do you like to eat chicken wings? Why... W-What's up with... You know if you split improv into two words, it's kind of like I'm pro, with a V at the end. Are you guys ready for your next comedian? - Yeah. - Yes. Thanks. Hi, everybody. Hello. Hi. Wow, thank you, thank you. Give it up for, Will. It's good to be here. I did not Uber here. I do not Uber. All my guy friends want me to take an Uber whenever I'm scared to walk to my car, take an Uber, it's super safe. For who? Why... Why is it safe? All my guy friends are like, "What do you mean? There's a rating system." Oh, really? Is that what was wrong with hitchhiking? There was no rating system? I feel like all my mother ever said to me was "do not talk to strangers." Now every night I get in the car with one, I show him where I live, and then I eat his candy. - Yeah, of course, of course. - Thank you so much. Oh, yes. - Thanks. - Bye. I don't know, actually, if there are different belts in kickboxing. I just do the YouTube videos. Yo, let's definitely hit up that Warhol tomorrow, okay? Uh, look, Chip, I'm... I'm sorry about... Not now, Will. I think we can both agree that stand-up's not in the cards for you. Can't think of any reason for you to come out tomorrow night, but thanks for coming in. Hey. What? You the comedian? Apparently not. Are you the comedian Will Chu who was on the radio? Look, man, I know Ohio sucks, alright? Will Chu who told a story on the radio where you ended up in a trailer with a girl who had a boyfriend? And you were in my fucking home, drinking my beers? When I found two open beers, I couldn't understand why does my girl have two open beers? I don't get it. Are you that Will Chu who lives at 223 Clark Street in Steubenville? It is too late to say no? Ow! I never laid my hands on her. No shit. And by the way, no one will fucking believe you if you tell them what I did. I've done it a bunch. What's up? You've reached Jen. Well, not actually. I'm not here. You know what to do. Hey, babe. I just got back. Thought I'd give you a call. Things are going pretty okay here. Y-You know what, maybe... maybe it's not so good. Actually, it's a pretty fucking horrible night. Maybe stand-up is just not really in the cards, you know? Maybe I just don't have it. Bye. Hey, Will. Lunch. Hey. Oh. Whoa. Whoa, man, what happened to your eye? Well, a cop punched me in the face because I was hanging out with his girl. That's fucking awesome. That's fucking awesome. Yeah, well, just getting something to eat, then I'm hitting the road. Whoa, wait... wait a minute. What about tonight? There's no tonight. I'm heading back to Ohio. Didn't you quit your job to do this? Yeah, but you saw what I did last night. Yeah, you bombed. Bombed hard, too. Shit, your ass should be on a TSA watch list. Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Will Chu. Chip said I'm done. Chip said? Chip said you're done? What about you? You... You say it's over? Man, you know what? Go on. Go on. Get the fuck out of here, man. If that's all it takes, go ahead on. Bye. Bye. Who gives a damn? You saw me. It went terrible. You actually should be proud of yourself. Y-You going quick. You... You... You actually quit your job, man. Quit your job, drove your ass down here. Been getting on the stage. You're actually doing it. One, two bad shows, and now that's it. That's all it take? Ain't the last no you going to get. You're going to hear a whole avalanche of no's you stay in this business. There's going to be shows that you want going to be a no. You're going to get shows that you're hired on, they're going to fire you. You're going to have things that your friends book that you thought you should book because you believe you funnier than they are. You're going to write a new joke, you're going to be out on that stage, you're going to try it, and that audience is going to be like, "No, I want to hear all the old shit." But guess what is more powerful than all of those no's. Your belief in yourself. You know, what happened to you last night, sure, it's the worst thing that can happen to a comic. You bombed. And in a spectacular fashion. I mean, boom. You in pain? No, not really. Just a shiner. No, no, no, you in pain. You in pain, I'm in pain. That's... That's what the life of a comic is, man. We take our pain. We got to find that stuff. That's what we take on stage. When we find that pain, got to learn to embrace it. Take what's personal and you give it to that audience, and it makes them laugh. But the thing about stand-up, son, you listening? Is that you have a chance to be better today than you was yesterday. It's another show tonight. If he was the one that's, like, doing the... If he's like, "Ohio sucks," first... first and... If you think about it, like, Neil... Neil Armstrong... Hey. I got your message. So you had a bad weekend. You don't give up on something you love that much so quickly. Give me a call. We can talk about it. I'm here for you, Will. I believe in you. I love you. Hey, Will, glad to see you. - You are? - Yeah, you just reminded me I'm supposed to take your name down from the marquee. Okay, about that, is Chip here? Yeah, he's in the office. - Can I talk to him? - Yeah. T Dog for Captain Crunch. Yeah, little kamikaze's here to see you. Yeah. Hey, Chip. I was going to text you. We need to settle up. Before you say anything, I'm here begging you for one last set. What happened to your face? I had a really, really rough night. I don't give a shit, Will. This is all I got, man. Stand-up is all I got. Then you don't got much because you're not good at stand-up. I started off okay, right? Let me just finish the weekend the same way I started. And if I'm really no good, then you'll never hear from me again. Please. I promise. One last spot. Yes, thank you. Thank you, Chip. Okay. Welcome to the world-famous Improv. Sunday night, make some noise. Dude, what the fuck? This fucking cock wad I sold a T-shirt to last night just came up to me in the lobby wanting to return it. Who the fuck returns a T-shirt? I'm sorry to hear that. Anyway, buddy, I'm telling you, that fucking shiner looks so dope. You are going to be like a chick magnet tonight. Anyway, bro, grand finale tonight. I'm pumped to hear what's in that book, buddy. You're going to kill it. - Thanks. - You got it, bro. My "pleazh." Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be starting the show in just a few moments. There's no video or flash photography during the show. Now, before we get started, I got to let you know to keep your talking to a minimum but your laughter to a maximum. Who's ready for a good show tonight? I can't hear you. Who's ready for a good show tonight? Put your hands together for Will Chu. What's up, Pennsylvania? How you guys doing? Awesome. So, as you guys can tell, I got this black eye. The reason is when I went outside the other day... Ohio sucks. Ohio sucks. Ohio sucks. Okay. Ohio sucks, right? Ohio sucks. Ohio sucks. Everybody, why don't everybody do it? Ohio sucks, Ohio sucks, Ohio sucks. Yeah, you know what? M-Maybe these guys are right. Ohio does kind of suck, right? Is there anybody from Ohio? Good, yeah, there's a reason why. Right, look, look, actually, actually, if you think about it, Ohio is where legends are born. Legends, right? If you think about it, we got the Wright Brothers, first in flight... from Ohio. John Glenn, first man in space, from Ohio, right? Neil Armstrong, first man on the moon... from Ohio. So if history has taught us anything, it's taught us that men will do anything to get the fuck up out of Ohio. Right? Right? So maybe it does suck, I don't know. I don't know. Right? So my dad passed away a few years ago. Not to bum anybody out. People die all the time, even Asians. It's okay. You know, we don't age but we die. It's okay, it's fine. So stand-up was like me and my father's thing. We actually grew up watching Billy G, your headliner tonight, give it up for Billy G, right? And I always wondered, like, is he, like, watching me from upstairs? That's what people say all the time, right? Is he watching me work? Is he watching me when I'm just drinking coffee in the morning? Is he watching me when I'm masturbating? You know? 'Cause he's probably got a lot of footage of that. Hey, what if he's here tonight watching me from upstairs and he's looking at me and he's like, "Man, that is my son doing stand-up. My only son doing stand-up comedy. And I must say, I'd rather watch him masturbate." Ohio sucks. Ohio sucks. Ohio sucks. Hey. I just want to thank you for letting me do my last set. Here is your check. This weekend means more to me than any amount of money. So... this is me telling you... I need an emcee in two weeks in Kansas City. - You free? - Absolutely. I'm in. And I think we confirmed that you've got my cellphone number. Let's just do e-mail. It's a little more professional. Okay, but you know you can call me anytime you want. Thanks, sir. Thanks, Chip. So it begins. Whew. So it begins. Deejay: You know your opening act from the Pennsylvania Improv and other clubs and colleges. Give it up for Will Chu. Kansas City, how you guys doing? You know, I used to be a full-time physician. And I was doing stand-up comedy on the side. And, uh, I was always scared to make that next step. I was a waiter. It was the greatest job ever. I officially never quit. I just took a leave of absence. I still have my name tag to this day... true story. If this shit don't work out, I'm going back to Golden Corral in Tallahassee. My first night doing stand-up, I actually did really well. Like, by accident. And then I bombed for like two years after that before I was, you know, able to get laughs again. I was terrible. Horrible. Just horrendous. You got five minutes, and I think I did four at the most maybe. And the second time, I did three. You would have thought I would have gotten longer, but I actually got shorter. I did some editing. So yeah, I guess it was kind of hard. But it was fun because I loved it. And I guess if I looked at it logically, I probably wouldn't have done it.
