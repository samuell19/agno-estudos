It's here. I can feel it. I can feel a presence. A presence bound to this house. Who... Who are you? Yes, yes... It's a woman. No! No! I don't want you, go away! Go away! - It's my poor Daniela. - Don't move. It's an evil presence... No, no... No! No! Go away! I don't want you! Go away, you're hurting me! No! Go away! You're scaring me! You're scaring me! - What's going on? - Be quiet. No! No! I don't want to! Leave me alone! Get out of my body! Pigs... You're nothing but a bunch of filthy upper class pigs. Staring at me with that idiotic expression won't do you any good. This is not Daniela's voice. You're soiling the good name of our family. You filthy, perverted, two-faced whores, you keep hiding behind your good name... but there's nothing but rot behind your masks! You're rotten! Putrified! Darn it! Somebody is touching me. Where? - Between my legs. - Don't be an idiot. - It's true! Whore! What's happening? Make it stop! Andrea, do something! That's enough! Stop it! Enough of this farce! No... No... No... No... No! No! No! No! No! That girl worries me. Perhaps it was a bad decision to keep her isolated in this remote house. At her age she should meet other people. She's never set foot beyond the castle gardens. I'm afraid she'll become an insufferable, problematic girl. You should be proud of your daughter, dear. I would have never expected to have a granddaughter like her. The difficult phase she's going through happens in every woman's life. It's in a time like this that a father can play a pivotal role in a daughter's life. She'll have to get used to a more modest living. I'm going to sell the castle. You can't do it! I'm your mother and I'll forbid you! The Caroli family has lived here for fifteen generations! You forget our debts. How will we pay them this year? There's still time to think about those. You're being unreasonable! You don't realize what we are dealing with. You're still living in the golden age of your youth, so you don't see reality for what it is. I'll handle things. You've always been weak, and this proves it. You won't sell this house, your brother will help us. He has all the money we need. Adolfo is a vegetable, do you really expect to rely on him? All his wealth is in the hands of his wife, and you know it. And unfortunately so does that so called administrator she brings around. We'll never get a penny out of them to save this dump. Why don't you marry her, then? What? Who would stop you from marrying Nais? That way, Adolfo's wealth will stay in the family. Mother, you don't know what you're talking about. Adolfo is paralyzed, but he's still alive. Do you understand what that means? Not for much longer, I reckon. That's the sad truth. You've always been able to astound me. How can you say that about Adolfo? You're talking about your son. I'm talking about our family and this castle. Our family has lived here for three centuries, and we'll keep it like that for as long as I live. Very well, but don't count on me. I'm sorry, Mother. I'm not going to marry again. Not even if I have the chance. Mind my words. But what is so absurd about my idea? I think it's rather clear, Mother. Daniela is dead, but she's still in my life. I'll never fill the void she left. Not for now, at least. And it's very inappropriate of you to suggest me to marry my brother's wife. Besides, Nais was right for him because he was always seeking third-rate harlots. You know I can't tolerate such language! We'll talk again once you decide to speak in a manner fitting your upbringing. Am I wrong or were you talking about me? Mother can be quite unreasonable. You're neck-deep in trouble. Your mother is more clear-headed than you think. She often says very practical things. You still haven't answered my question, though. Since when have you become so curious? Do you think the spirit belonged to one of your ancestors? I've never believed in such things. She seemed to know the family well, though, but she didn't sound very polite. She was much more explicit with you, as a matter of fact. She called me a whore and she was perfectly right. All women are whores, more or less. And what are you? More or less? I'll let you be the judge of that. Well? I don't have enough elements for a proper answer. Perhaps your lawyer could help me with that. Feel free to ask him! Or you could just ask the source. I won't hide any secrets from you. Help! Dad! You and your brother were never much alike. Sometimes I wonder how you manage to bear the dusty, gloomy atmosphere of this place. But you live here as well. Not for much longer, mark my words. Dad! Dad! - Dad! - What's wrong, Bimba? I was walking in the park and I heard noises coming from a bush. It's normal to hear noises in a park. Maybe it was the wind or a squirrel. No, no! I saw snakes! Calm down, now. There've never been snakes around here, least of all in our park. Bimba? Bimba? Oh, excuse me. I heard Bimba calling, and... Nothing to worry about. She got a little scared after hearing noises in the park. Take her upstairs, please. Get some rest, dear. You have to study today, you know. - You don't believe me, but... - Rest, now. Let's go, you can tell me everything in your room. Remember, our Lord doesn't want us to lie. Well, I see you're in no mood for conversation. Nothing much we could talk about, to be honest. I beg to differ, Andrea. And I suggest you to listen to me one of these days. See you later. I wanted to apologize about last night's incident. I believe a violent death took place in this house. The spirit said her name was Lucrezia. Was she one of your ancestors, maybe? I could have taken some precautions if anybody had warned me about this story. Have you ever experienced similar phenomena? We had never done a seance in this house before. I just hoped to put you in contact with your wife's blessed soul. It's clear that Lucrezia's lingering spirit was still in this house. Who knows how long she had been waiting for a chance to speak. Can't you tell me anything else about her? I'd rather change the subject. There's nothing more they're going to tell you, Lucrezia was the black sheep of the Caroli family. Nobody knows whether she took her own life or was killed by one of her many lovers. I'd like you to spare us your cheap sarcasm. See? He won't talk about it. Where is Bimba? Why hasn't she joined us for supper yet? I don't know, Count. I knocked twice but she didn't answer. Good evening, everyone. Good evening, Grandma. Good evening, Dad, Nais and Giorgio. Good evening, Madam. I see that resting did wonders to you. You look absolutely lovely, tonight. Thank you. - What's for supper, Maria? - Soup, chicken and vegetables. Oh, no soup for me. Bring me the main course. You should try the soup, it's delicious. When I was your age, I ate three portions of it. When you were my age, you were already screwing all your father's friends. Ain't that right, Gran? What did you say? Bimba, how dare you! Mind your fucking business, I'll say anything I want. Got it? I want you to immediately apologize to your grandmother! No. Miss, please. You'll make me drop the tray. When will you stop fucking Maria with this dirty cock of yours, huh? That's enough, Bimba! I've had it with your language, go back to your room! - Sister Sofia, please. - At once, Countess. I just don't understand. Who could have taught her such obscene expressions? Come on, speak your mind. - I know you're talking about me. - Nais, please. Keep stuffing your face and don't interfere! I'm part of this honorable family, whether you like it or not, and I've really had it with your insinuations! I remain adamant in saying she couldn't have heard such words from me or my mother. I notice you didn't mention Adolfo. That's how you see the world: your family and a few elected others at one side, all the peasants at the other. I'm so glad that Lucrezia's spirit is taking you people down a notch. I know you see Adolfo as a poor whore-marrying deviant. But guess what, the whore likes to speak her mind. You're responsible for Bimba's upbringing, yet you're trying to blame me for her obscene language. You don't even care that she's going through a problematic phase. You'd be ready to disown yourselves just to preserve the good name of the family. I won't allow you to talk to me like that. You're not only insulting me and my mother, but your husband as well. Is that so? I haven't had a husband for five years! Adolfo has already become another memory in the ancestors' gallery. And how dare you tell me how to treat him? I heard how much you respect Adolfo just this afternoon. All he is to you is a living corpse. A living corpse with a vast amount of wealth. That's the only thing you really care about, but I won't let you have a penny. Then we'll see if you'll keep saying that "A Caroli is always a Caroli". You know, Adolfo, they want me to marry your brother to get all your money. I may be an immoral whore, but you're a bunch of hypocrites! That's what you are! And you stop eating like a pig! - Where are you going? - To see my daughter. Excuse me. Please, stop crying and try to get some rest. Anyone can lose their temper. Everything will be different tomorrow, and much better. Now be a good girl and don't cry anymore. But... Why? Why have you done this? To shit on you, whore! Are you awake, Bimba? I'm sorry about slapping you. I didn't mean to. I just lost my temper. Please, let's forget about what happened. What do you say? Forgive me, Dad, I beg you. Of course, honey. Of course. - It's all over now, stop crying. - Forgive me, I'm sorry. Hi. What are you doing here? My, how rude. Are you going to keep acting like that? A man's bedroom is not the ideal place to respect etiquette. You could be right. But to me it just looks like a way to live a moralistic life. Puritanical, if you will. Alright, let's change the question. Anything I can do for you? Do you have any sleeping pills? I can't sleep. You must admit it wasn't exactly what I'd call a nice day. Indeed. Let me see if I still have some sleeping pills in the bathroom. - Sorry, there's no pills left. - A glass of Scotch it is, then. That's something you have for sure. Here. Do you need anything else? Just to drink it. You could drink it in your room. Don't you think you're exaggerating a little? You're my brother-in-law, after all. I'm not a stranger. Or are you afraid you'd follow your mother's suggestion? Leave her out of this. - Your mother or... - Don't even mention Daniela. Cover your legs. Don't be a fool. Just my legs? What about my breasts? Did you forget about them? Cover both. You noticed. I thought such things didn't interest you anymore. Cover yourself, I said. Take a good look at me, first. Don't you want to touch me? Don't just stand there. Take your whisky and leave. Tell me, when was the last time a woman entered your bedroom? - It's my own business. - Wrong. It's everyone's business. You're strung tight like a violin string. I believe you should relax a little, don't you think so? And you'd be willing to sacrifice yourself for it. A sacrifice I'd gladly make. What do you say? I say no. I've had enough. Get out! You're either impotent or crazy. Who do you think you are, Andrea? Either way, I'll be in your thoughts tonight. Your eyes gaze at my body... You won't be able to forget it when you'll be alone. Take a good look. Long for my body. It can be yours. If you get aroused in bed, try not to masturbate. You'd make me feel guilty. Good night. - Where have you been? - Minding my own business. Who said you could enter my bedroom? You went to see that wimp Andrea. If he's a wimp, then I don't see why this should concern you. Are you jealous? You're a big slut! Right, and that's the way you like it. Come on, make an offer. I'm for sale tonight. Whore... You'll have to do better if you want to fuck me. You filthy masochist! You want more, don't you? - Take this! - More! Hit me! - Harder, you pussy! - Take this! - You're the real wimp, not Andrea. - You like it, don't you? Take this! And this! Can't do it without preliminaries, huh? You like this, don't you? Turn over. That's everything your virility can offer? It's gone with a scream. The thing is, You're just a pansy, the wreck of a typical male. Nothing left for you now but to suffer my nails. Let's see who the real masochist is. Yes, yes, I like it... - Like this? - Yes... Yes... You like this? Please, stop... You're all the same. You're all pussies. What about me, now that you came? There's still a long way before I climax. I want to cum too, asshole. Who taught you how to make love? You selfish jerk. Give me your hand. Let me cum. Like this. I know this is your favorite thing. Like this? Like this? Like this? Deeper... Deeper... Deeper... Harder... Harder... You like it? Are you coming? Go on, come... I'll come again if you go on like this... You're the best whore in the world. Again. Again... Again... Again... - Nice, isn't it? - Oh, yes... Kiss my breasts... What are you doing here? Why are you spying on me? I wasn't spying on you, I'd never do that. Spy! Spy! You're nothing but a damn spy! Spy! Spy! Spy! It's shocking. I don't understand how a child can do something like this. We should have never called that witch. We stopped being ourselves since she stepped into this house! You can stop worrying, the witch is about to leave. How dare you? You're the one who requested my services! My mother didn't mean to insult you. She can't treat me this way! You called me here to work for you and that's what I've done! There's no such thing as witches. I just act as a medium between the worlds of the living and the dead. Let me add that, after knowing you, I fancy the latter to a bunch of snakes like you! I heard you're having a fancy party tonight. I hope somebody will drive me to town. I'll send you an invoice for my services. Goodbye. My opinion is you're all being overdramatic for something totally natural. I guess you don't remember your adolescence. No teenager is a saint. Bimba has just a delayed puberty. That's the reason she's having these morbid impulses. Don't you agree with me? I think she's right, we shouldn't worry too much. We can't just pretend nothing's happened. Bimba knows we took her teddy bear and I think she also knows we're spying on her. Did you hear what I said, Andrea? I'll go talk to her. I want to find out what's going on in her mind. It's the least I can do. I agree with you. Bimba? Bimba? Where are you hiding, little monkey? What are you doing? I listen to the plants breathing. Can you hear their breathing? So you're not afraid of being alone in the garden anymore. You told me there were snakes in the bushes. I made those up, there have never been any snakes here. - Bimba... - Yes? Would you like to talk a bit? I know what you want to talk about. You're totally right. I'm a terrible daughter and I give you a lot of reasons to worry about me. I know, I'm acting weird. I don't know what gets into my mind sometimes. See, Bimba, I... You're the best father in the world, you're the only person I really care about Will you please forgive me? Of course. I've already forgiven you. - Give me a kiss and I'll believe you. Alright. - Two aperitifs, please. - Thank you. - We stayed here this year. - Your drink. But you've always been so active. Oh, I'm no spring chicken anymore. - Mother... - Have you two met? - How do you do? - Have you seen Andrea? - He was here a moment ago. Maybe he's gone out for a breath of fresh air. I'll look in the garden. Thanks. You sure you don't mind driving me to town? Whenever you wish, dear. Let's go now, then. You're so kind. What's wrong, Andrea? You can't disappear like this. - The guests will be offended. - Too bad for them. I'm really not in the mood for formal conversation. I have other things in mind, believe me. Have you worried about Bimba? Did you manage to speak to her? It didn't help. Quite the contrary, actually. I've never been treated like this, believe me. They're horrible people. Thank you. She's leaving. It is about time. Did you notice that sometimes Bimba speaks with that medium's voice? Like when that woman was in a trance, I mean. Do you think she's trying to scare us? I haven't the foggiest. I just can't explain it. Try not to think about it now. I'm sorry about last night. I behaved horribly. I thappens. I was hoping for a sweeter ending. I'm going through a hard time. Bimba is such a nice girl. We should introduce them, my daughter is alone, too. - Yes, this house is... - We could go riding together. Have you met Nais? Pigs! You're nothing but a bunch of filthy pigs! What are you doing here, Bimba? I told you to stay in your room. You hypocrites! Look!Look! Bimba, cover yourself immediately! There's nothing to worry about. The physical development of your daughter is perfectly normal. Puberty often brings some psychological issues... that will disappear with the first sexual experiences. And remember she's sixteen, after all. Her physical health is excellent. What about those melodramatic crises? You've never witnessed those, but she seems a different person. She speaks with the voice of a much older woman. Listening to that is quite shocking. My dear Caroli, her mother's death must have deeply affected her, and that's why she's trying to identify herself with an adult, she does it in order to find some confidence. Stay close to Bimba and have her spend time with other children. Everything'll be fine. - Goodbye, Professor. Thank you. - Goodbye. Well, well. - Nais! What are you doing here? - It looks like times are changing. I should be the shocked one, according to the rules of the game. What a shame, you looked better before. Please, stop. Men usually look better with their clothes on. I guess you must be the exception that proves the rule. This is my honest feminine opinion, of course. I'm in no condition to joke around. Well, you should be! After Daniela's death you've become a shell of your former self. Don't you know that... What I know is that you all think Bimba is Lucrezia's reincarnation, even if you don't have the guts to say it out loud! You'll all get hurt if you don't stop with this nonsense! Stop thinking about her adolescence. Think about yourself, it will do both of you good. Look. And now give me an honest answer. What do you think of my body? Don't think about anything else. You keep teasing me. It doesn't leave me cold, if that's what you want to hear. There's a void in my life, and you're very beautiful. So why don't you desire me? Nais, please. You mustn't. We shouldn't. But why not, Andrea? This is just hypocrisy. You know what I've been through. I can't resist anymore, I'm going crazy. Adolfo is my brother. And I've loved him! But he's been in that state for five years. Imagine, five long years. I'm a woman, don't you understand what it means? We've been staring at each other for months. Months that we desired each other. Our nerves won't hold forever. We can't go on like this. It's not right, Nais. We've got every right to do it! The right to live and to love each other! I want to live, Andrea. With you. Tonight you won't be alone either. I'll keep you company, do you fancy the idea? They say you're like a statue but I'll get you moving, trust me. You're gonna like it. Look. Like what you see? Look... You like it, don't you? Take a good look at it. It's yours. Uncle Adolfo? - Uncle Adolfo, say something! - Bimba! What happened? Whore! You're just a filthy whore! Oh, no... God... Help me, Sofia! I beg you! Of course I will, my child. Try to calm down now, it's not your fault. You must try to forget. Put those at the foot of the bed. I'm still struggling to understand how it could have happened. Bimba must have sensed he wasn't feeling well and went to keep him company. I heard her screaming and rushed to the room, but it was already too late. Please, join your son and don't worry, I'll take care of everything. Thank you, Sister Sofia, you're a gem. Bimba hasn't joined us for lunch today either. We need to send her to a holiday somewhere, Andrea. It's too late for that now, Mother. She's too upset. She's young, she'll manage to forget. Daniela would tell you the same if she were alive. I hope we'll finally leave this house once we sort out the papers about his patrimony. I don't know yet, I have to think about it. What does that mean? Don't tell me you'd like to stay in this catacomb to rot forever. Let me remind you that I'm a fully grown woman. Of course you are, but not that mature when it comes to your sexual behavior. - What do you mean? - You know damn well, my dear Nais. You had that chump screwing you, and he's just looking to get Adolfo's money! Don't you get you fell for it like an idiot? What did you say? I won't allow those sort of insinuations! - Stop fighting! - You shyster! I know your game! Take your hands off me! At least try to show some respect for poor Adolfo's corpse! Besides, it's not up to you. Nais can make her own choices. She'll be most welcome if, as I hope, she'll choose to stay with her family. "Her family", give me a break! You're a nest of vipers, and Adolfo's money is the only thing keeping you together! That's the truth. I demand you to leave this house. You're not part of this so called "nest of vipers", so I ask you to leave now! At once, Madam, and I'm pleased to oblige. You haven't seen the last of me, you'll pay my services to the last penny. I'm sorry to bother you. I wish not to sound inopportune, but I feel I should remind you we are facing bigger issues at the moment. Your daughter is very ill. It is clear that the recent events have taken a toll on her mental state. We need to look after her. Professor Salvi asserted that Bimba is perfectly healthy. I don't see what we should get worried about. There's more than physical health, Madam. Sometimes, it's the soul that can get very ill. Are you trying to imply that Bimba is insane? I was talking about her soul, not her mind. I think we should feel responsible for our negligence... ...and for setting a bad example. Bad example? How dare you? This is a perfectly respectable household! Please, Mother, calm down. Sofia might be right. What do you suggest we do? Unfortunately, my duty as a nurse has almost come to an end, and in a few months I'll take the veil, Jesus willing. I'd like to use this time to heal your daughter's soul, if you wish. And how would you heal her? Through prayer? Through love and compassion. Two qualities that are not of this household. I agree with you. I'm putting Bimba in your hands from now on. Bimba? It's me, Sofia, open the door. Open it. Bimba! Bimba! What are you doing in there? Do you feel sick? Open the door, Bimba. Bimba, what's wrong? - Why are you crying? - I'm sick, I don't know what's happening to me. Come on, put your head on the pillow. I feel sick! Cover yourself or you'll catch a cold. Try to relax. - Help me, please... - I will never leave you. I'm here to make you feel safe. I want you to believe in me. We'll always be together, you'll see. And, one step at a time, your illness will disappear. Try to sleep now. Close your eyes and don't think about bad things. Sleep, little one. Like this, yes... Sleep... Sleep... Bimba? Where are you? Bimba, get away from that door immediately. No. Take a look. - Have you gone crazy? - Absolutely not. I love looking. You should give it a try. Come on. Just for a minute, I know you'll like it. Come on. Come on. Look. - No, I don't want to... - You have to look. You have to. Pretty nice, huh? It's all inside her. No... No, let's go. It'll be better for everyone. Let's go, Bimba. I want you to try to forget what you saw. Now you get why I'm always spying on them? No, I'll never get it. You really shouldn't have. I shouldn't have let you. Don't be silly, we won't tell anyone. It will remain our little secret. Don't you want to be my friend? - Don't you? - Of course I do. It's the thing I want most now. I want to help you getting rid of these strange obsessions. - Do you really worry about me? - Absolutely. You're my only friend. Don't ever leave me. Never. I promise we'll always be together. - You can count on me. - Come here, I want you beside me. I'm too afraid of sleeping alone. Please. All right, I'll stay with you. Thanks. Why don't you take off your veil? All right. The cap, too, it's warm in here. I want to see your hair. Oh, your natural look is beautiful. I wish my hair were like yours. It's so soft. You have such great skin. It feels just like a peach. So sweet. Stop, you shouldn't tell me these kind of things. But why? Well... It embarrasses me. Why does it embarrass you? I can't really say. I can't. Oh, so you don't know? You have breasts, too. Do they look like mine? Yes, of course. I'm just like all the other women. Can you show me your legs? I've never seen them before. Why do you want to see them? It looks like you have wheels under your clothes! Don't be silly. Take a look. You're soft... You like it, don't you? No! No! Enough!Enough! Who's there? I've already felt this wind once before. You rejected me, but you won't be able to save yourself this time. Your god has abandoned you because I've finally showed you the truth. No! It's not true! I didn't sin! I rejected you! I did! And you broke your promise to Bimba. You said you'd help her, but you left her languishing in bed alone! Why did you say those things? That voice... You're not Bimba... You're Lucrezia! It makes no difference until I get out of this body. And you're the only one who can free me. No, don't tempt me... No! I don't want to sin! I don't want to! The only way to save Bimba's soul is to lose your own. You were the one I really wanted to curse for all eternity, but you were so strong. But you can't escape me now. You are at my mercy now. You promised Bimba. Now get up... and take off your clothes. Do it. Take off your clothes. Slut! Yes... Yes... Yes... Yes... At last I'm inside you. I'm in your blood and in your breath. It's as if you were born during this very moment. Everything in you belongs to me. Your mind, your soul and your body. I gave you the knowledge and now you understand what love means. It's the tormented struggle of your senses, it's the subtle joys of ecstasy, it's the wild pleasures of sex. You'll never be able to get rid of me for as long as you live. Sexual lust will corrupt your soul little by little. It'll force you to seek more and more pleasure, each time more intensely, until your flesh will become a vessel of sin. An endless hell of pleasure. An endless hell of sin. Bimba? Where are you? Bimba? Dad! Dad! - Hi, Dad. - Hello. - How are you feeling? - I'm fine. You look lovely today. Let me take a good look at you. Somebody broke my teddy. Can you have it fixed? - I love it so much. - Of course, let me handle this. - Don't worry. - Thanks, Daddy. I'm glad you're doing so well, we were all so worried about you. Sister Sofia did really help you, don't you think? Enjoy life. Your body, your senses... No, don't do it! - Sofia! - Stop! No! No! - Bimba, stop! - Sofia! Don't go! Sofia! Sofia... No... Sofia... Sofia... You're safe now, my child... Get away, dear... Subtitled by Francesco Massaccesi
