This film is freely adapted from real events. History will note: "The dawn of December 22, 1959 saw the Lyons executioner coldly carry out his task. A foul crime has been avenged by justice. In other words, I have been dispatched. You'll agree it's most unpleasant to lose a part of oneself so brutally. Especially if I assert that, on the path that led me here, I was no doubt a little guilty but above all a true victim. Yes, a victim. As I exhale my last breath, allow me to convince you of this incredible truth. It all began as it must... In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. The earth was without form and void. Darkness filled the deep and God's spirit moved above the waters. And God said, "Let there be light." And there was light. God saw the light was good and divided the light from the darkness. He called the light Day and the darkness Night. And God said, "Let the waters be gathered in one place and let the dry land appear." And it was so. God called the dry land Earth and the mass of waters Sea. "Let the waters thrive with living creatures and let birds fly above the Earth in the firmament." And it was so. And God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed life into his nostrils and man became a living soul. God planted a garden in Eden, to the East, and put the man he had made in it. He took one of his ribs and made a woman from it. The village of Albon, please! I'm looking for Albon. - It's that way. - Thank you! He led the woman to the man and the man said, "This is bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh." Come in, Father. The kitchen... Your bedroom is upstairs. I'll show you the dining room first. Come with me. There, that's better. Perfect. I told Mrs Belot the other day, "The new priest's on his way. I'll clean the presbytery." She wanted to come too. She's always meddling in others' business. Mind your head. Know what? I didn't turn her down. The poor thing's always so alone. I tidied up the garden too. Things are growing so fast after all the rain. I found snails. Do you like snails? Don't be shy now. If there's anything you don't like, tell me. You'll be very happy here. Look at this lovely view. Lovely, isn't it? This Christ that my love turns to day and night... His hand will be mine. His eyes will be mine. Through the Lord and with him, I shall be the one who dwells within you. Just as you will dwell within me. I really loved your sermon, Father. Just a few words I said in prayer on arriving at the presbytery to offer to my parishioners. Simple words. Not at all, they were... Thank you. Thank you all. My dear friends, we all agree. Nothing, as yet, justifies my decapitation. So I think it's time to begin my confession. My biblical ambitions misunderstood, I had to leave my last parish. The diocese wished to isolate me. But, in his goodness, the Lord made the arid land to which I had been condemned into a splendid orchard. Albon... Was it not the ideal village for the creation of a divine and carnal terrestrial city? From my first days here, I was sure of it. Within this garden, there was a generous spring that sang sweetly in my ears without cease. I confess to Almighty God, the Virgin Mary and Saint Michael... It's hard to say... How can I put it? No tenderness... Not a word... It was intoxicating to hear their murmurs... Disappointed, forgotten... abandoned by love... Cry no more, my pretty hearts. Henceforth, a king is among you. I saw appear upon the wall that tree, that plant emerging from my breast. On each branch, all kinds of kings, priests, prophets and warriors. One holding a sword or a harp, the other the crown. A single tree, and a whole forest. And, at the apex, oh, such a flower... So beautiful, so radiant, so pure, so dazzling, that I closed my eyes and my heart broke. - Tea is served, ma'am. - Very good. - Well? - I like it. I like it. It's beautiful. Not his best-known play but read it and tell me. This is Armance. A potential first queen of my realm. However, that day of presages saw an awkward incident. I'm sure you have realized that it's not easy to talk literature with the locals. I imagine such inconveniences were rare in Lyons. Certain parishioners shared books with me. Here, we have Miss Desboine, our schoolteacher. A theatre lover, like you. A true spinster but I like her. My cousin Solange has a large library. Her husband even has some rare editions. Unfortunately, I've realized that they... Good heavens! What dexterity! I feel ridiculous. I'm sorry, really, I... It's all so ridiculous. The thing is, sport and in particular football are, I must confess... a childhood passion. There are much worse sins! I'm sorry, I got carried away. - Did you scald yourself? - I don't think so. You're drenched. Let me dry you off. Here... I feel you haven't finished surprising me. Really, come and see the games you want. You know what? It'll be our secret. Our secret... Dear Armance... How I still love the echo of those words in my ears! Riding back, I thought of my awkward acrobatics that could have scuppered my plans. Yet things went differently. Not only did the chatelaine open her gates to me, but my sudden and surprising lack of control gave me a bright idea. On this day of victory for the national team, I decided to enlist twelve young apostles. - Sanchez, heads or tails? - Tails. Tails. Ready, gentlemen... The joy of games at the club I had just founded would be matched by great evangelical efficiency. The thing was, after each training session, my twelve apostles sang my praises, lauding their lord and master's soccer lessons. Victory or nothing. The love of the colours. The warrior spirit. "We'll crush them!" Reassured to see their offspring trained in the ethics of football, their fathers returned to their occupations. A good thing too for, as you have understood, this story can do without them. As for the ladies... The ladies... Here they are. Admiring... Moved... Dazzled by their brood's skills. A high kick here, a flick-on there... My apostles shot, tackled, and lobbed with such passion that it was hard for the mothers to remain cold. From one mother to the next, from one village wife to the next, from one woman to the next, the evangelization gained ground. He's a sportsman who will carry his love of Christ all over the parish. An athletic priest... I should go to mass. If he was less charming, it wouldn't worry me. But how can I put it? I fetched my son from football and the priest praised his playing. He was breathing heavily as he spoke... I feel sorry for you, riding your bike all over our hills. I'm not complaining. I'd like to see you suffer less. Surely not in a sports car? Or, worse, on a motorcycle? Why not? Let's go in. Talking of motorbikes... Do you know the Terrot? The sound of its engine is a dazzling song. I'm very impressed. I'm sorry? I'm impressed to see how the people of the parish have adopted you. With a few exceptions, the football club delights children and parents. You're ingenious. What do you mean? Or, if you prefer, the idea is ingenious. It's even ingeniously seductive. I must say, you've focused countless eyes on you. I'm merely serving the parish. And the parish ladies! After your sermon last Sunday, on leaving church, a woman whom I shall not name confided in me. She spoke of you in rather unfitting terms... In frequenting you, I find myself forgetting that you're a priest. I only see the man. If I were to confess, I would say it's troubling but not unpleasant. I'm touched by your words. But one thing bothers me. Your cassock is horribly present. Perhaps, but it played its part in our meeting. True. And I shall respect it. But not indefinitely. Because, to tell the truth, I'd rather see you near me as naked as Saint Francis in his church. In order, of course, to cover you instantly with love. My tale could end here in the heart of a pleasant parish, at the head of a promising football club, marked by luscious afternoons in the shade of a sumptuous home. But how could I have stopped there? In this realm, everything carried me forward. I was walking on the waters. I'm RÃ©emi Berthon from Les Grives. I know, my boy. My mother sent me to fetch you for Louise. The Berthons lived in a humble farm outside the village. Married to an incompetent, the mother worked their tiny plot of land alone. On arriving there, I felt saddened. After a visit that night, the doctor said their daughter, young Louise, would not live much longer. I couldn't accept it. Have faith. Have faith and pray for her. My God! - What's wrong? - It's Louise Berthon. We must get her to hospital. My God... In the car carrying us to Lyons, I understood the hidden meaning of this trial. I was so moved by this that I had to discreetly wipe away a tear. In his boundless kindness, the Lord, my friend and accomplice, had offered me this sick child. You were so brave, Father. I'm still moved by it. The harvest would be a rich one. The ladies of Albon... My dear ladies of Albon... Your modesty at such praise pleases me. People can be a bit excessive. They must thank the Lord. "The souls of the just are in the hand of God, safe from all torment." That's in the Wisdom of Solomon. A fine Bible text and also a great king. Even so, you carried the child in your arms. That's true. I felt your heroism deserved a reward. You're adorable! You know the priest from the next parish, don't you? I've asked him to join our little conversation. Mantaille is very close and he knows some of your flock. And, moreover, he is a remarkable priest. Now then... We have heard that you travel around by motorcycle... A gift from the chatelaine. You know, I was very happy and proud to hear you saved that little girl. But now you disappoint me. Initially, I refused. But ultimately accepted. You must promise to return it. I'll do it today. I spoke to the generous donor. She sees it as support for the Church. A way to assist her confessor in what she sees as harsh and difficult work. All that is highly debatable, isn't it? Unless I'm a little "old hat", as they say these days. Is it possible to see this machine? I must admit it's a fine piece of machinery. I have no taste for such things. Have you used it much already? I saw every parishioner this week when it usually takes me a month. I felt I was wise to accept but it was a mistake. This is bothersome. We sent you to this parish expecting exemplary behaviour. That is the case, Father. Those sexual matters that you were accused of in Lyons must not turn into another vice, a more... mechanical one. After the unwarranted suspicion of Lyons, I have found peace here... that I shall not endanger with this vulgar gift. Monsignor, receive my confession for being tempted by the sin of covetousness and for being too lazy to travel the parish by bicycle. I'm listening, my son. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. May the Lord guide your words so that you may know your sins. In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. I confess to Almighty God, the blessed Virgin, the Archangel Michael, St John the Baptist... No false confession was ever so sincere. And, by the Lord's grace, so effective. The vicar general allowed me to use my motorbike. The door was wide open before me and I rushed at it! For a whole year, alongside my ministry and soccer, I travelled my orchard to harvest its patiently awaited fruit. Allow me to think of those happy days and to pay tribute to its flowers in bloom. As you know, Armance gave our lovemaking a literary bent. Before her bookshelves, love began as a pastourelle and galloped towards the epic to end in a lyrical ode that left us speechless. Solange... An unsettling steam machine, all Armance's cousin needed was a hot bath for her engine to race and ultimately explode in a frenzied mechanical orgasm. Desire the spiritual, pure milk to attain your salvation, the milkmaid seemed to preach, inviting me to make love in her husband's storeroom. Driven by the animal odour of the precious liquid, I thus quenched my thirst. Odette was very poor. But, on raising her generous behind, this modest Albon woman offered my senses a priceless treasure that enriched every minute of my nights. Armance, Jacqueline, Solange, Odette... How can I not thank Heaven for granting me so much grace? Happy as I was, I saw myself at the dawn of a reign as long and noble as King Solomon's. But, in fact, this golden age would be brief. Clorinde, you are no more! Alas, rather than fight you, when a coward was about to strike you dead, with such ardour I repelled from your breast the foul blow dealt by his hand, I thus saved the victim from his rage only to carry out myself such an outrage. At your feet, your lover beseeches you with tears of blood he dampens your wound. He would lay down his life to obtain your grace. FÃ©elix! Do you have to do that? Forgive me. I like it without the pause. Miss Desboine, who is the director? - You, but... - Thank you. FÃ©elix, you have a lot on your shoulders. One day, you'll be Lear or Hamlet. It's a lot of pressure. But let's be realistic, you're the only man in this theatre group. Maybe that's not a bad thing. But all the same... We must face this challenge proudly. Tell me, FÃ©elix, what's an actress for you? A woman of easy virtue, I fear. Not at all. She's a hard worker. Is it going well? How can I thank you for hosting us? It's a joy to see the barn used as a theatre again. You know Solange? Yes, of course. Your cousin, I think. When we were girls, we'd perform plays here that we'd written for our parents. Great works! And the people of Albon? They need practice, but I hope to perform one day. Armance, with this theatre, I don't think I've ever been happier. When I think of the pleasure you gave me last night, I tell myself the very same thing. Everything changed course one Sunday. The afternoon, the day's sinner was boring me silly. First, it was a man. Second, he was pitying his brother in the Algerian War, a land outside my parish that didn't interest me in the least. The Lord grants you forgiveness and peace and I hereby forgive all your sins. Sleep... Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course, Chief nourisher in life's feast. What do you mean? Still it cried to all the house, "Sleep no more!" Quiet! Stop! That wasn't good? Come in. Hello. - Can I help you? - I'd like to join your group. It's open to all. Have you ever... I'd like to try. She'd like to try. How charming! Very good. We're glad to welcome you. I asked her name. Her sweet lips parted... Rose. The blind little chick explained her grandmother had a farm nearby. She would be back for her later. She had to milk her goats. Milk her goats... Perfect! I offer her a seat: she finds that kind of me. Our small troupe is growing! Rose has joined us. We'll do the introductions later. There's a chair right here. There... Very good. FÃ©elix, let's take it from "Methought I heard..." Methought I heard a voice cry, "Sleep no more! Macbeth does murder sleep." The innocent sleep... Sleep... the death of each day's life. Sleep that knits up the raveled sleave of care... O, divine child... Pure among the pure. Lisette, I didn't see you. Come with me, Father. Garden peas... You're not pleased? I am, it's wonderful, Lisette. They're the year's first. Mrs Belot brought them and I said I'd do them with bacon. Sorry, I should be over the moon, but for some reason I feel... Sit down, Lisette. I feel as if I'd won the French Cup and the euphoria had given way to emptiness. - You had football today? - No, theatre. Afterwards, I was returning happier than ever and, all of a sudden, great lassitude overcame me. I had to stop by the road. It's wiser. I sat there without moving. My strength had drained away. A sign of intense experiences... and a promise of great things to come. Not at all. You're overworked, plain and simple. Mrs Belot says you work too much. On top of football, you have theatre now. To balance the body and the mind. That's no reason. All this activity will wear you down and your health will suffer. Look... You're trembling! It's true, you're right. It doesn't matter, Lisette. It's because, in Heaven, I see a pretty flower about to bloom. As the poor dear couldn't afford books in Braille, it was a joy for me to give her some. For one sight transported me more than any other: my young intended's light fingers caressing the pages. Before such grace, I dreamt of being alone at our theatre with her. I was overcome by the sudden urge to disrobe completely and masturbate while watching her pretty fingers on the page. After all, would my Queen of the Night even know? But no such thing occurred. I had to remain calm, controlled, patient... Need I fear an innocent young girl with such terribly blue eyes? The farm where Rose lived was in the hills. Her grandmother was seen in the village but wasn't very talkative. We simply knew she had taken her granddaughter in. Had Rose's parents rejected her when she lost her sight? Too poor to pay for a place in a home? In Albon, tongues were wagging. As I was nearby, I dropped in to bring a book for Rose. She's in the upper orchard. Go round the house and up the hill. Very good. Thank you. Shall I warm you some coffee? - Water will do. - I'll bring it. Here... It's yours. Victor Hugo. "Ruy Blas". I haven't read it. Thank you. I'm touched by your gifts. We could work on some scenes with the group. Particularly Act III, Scene iii. The queen's monologue. "Listen to me..." Is that it? Yes, that's it. Your grandmother's here. Here, two glasses of water. Thank you, ma'am. Work hard. - I'll leave you. - Thank you. - Shall I read? - Absolutely. You can start at "Duke, Heaven has sent you for such a goal." I'll say Don CÃ©esar's little line. Go on. Duke, Heaven has sent you for such a goal. To save the teetering state and its oppressed people. And love me as I suffer. O CÃ©esar, I give you my soul. O CÃ©esar, I give you my soul. Queen for all, for you I am merely a woman. Madame... In my love, in my heart, Duke, I belong to you. I trust your honour to respect mine. When you call me, I'll come. I am ready. O CÃ©esar, a sublime mind rules you. Be proud, for genius is your crown. - A fine speech, isn't it? - Forgive me. Your reading moved me. You're crying! My God... As she fell into the trap, I imagined kissing her and even guiding her hand to a spot where she would have felt the effect that she had on me. But she suddenly clipped my wings. I'd like to ask you something. I'd like to look at your face... with my hands. Please do. What a strange feeling. Touching me without touching me... Caressing me without caressing me... Seeing me without seeing me... It was entirely new, unfamiliar, miraculous. Something broke within me. Great sweetness filled me. You won't believe me but tears welled up in my eyes. Tears of blissful happiness. This time, my friends, I have to admit, I was sincerely moved. Serge... Serge, congratulations. You'll be the team captain. Thank you, sir! You've worked hard and listened to me. "He who enters through the door is the shepherd of the flock." Congratulations. How was it? Good. Very good. Carry on. We've finished, Father. - What time is it? - 5 o'clock. Do you know why Rose isn't here? Does anyone know? Why would we know, Father? Don't just stand there, carry on. Start again. Will you agree to become my wife? If my aunt wishes it. Obviously, after theatre, I went to Rose's, post haste. But her grandmother had bad news for me. Rose was refusing to see anyone. Since going blind, she went through long periods of isolation. I insisted but to no avail. Just as I was about to pluck my pretty flower, I might have to go weeks without seeing her. So give me a quick kiss. Sir, please wait until we are married. After that, I'll kiss you all you want. I've seen you so little lately. I devote myself with passion to the parish. All the same... I'm surprised to find such an athlete in this condition. What's that? Thyme herbal tea. Lisette. That's a bit grim. Add some pear brandy. It'll taste better. Without lemon and elderflower, you may as well drink water. I can't smell a thing. This is no good at all, you know. Sage. But infuse it in milk. I add a little honey but you don't have to. Thank you, Odette. I'll tell Lisette. Just three cloves. Boil in water, let it steep 24 hours and drink straight down. It'll blow your socks off. Wouldn't it have been wiser to break the fever by inviting my four blooms to join me in bed? I never even thought of it. Unable to understand the workings of my mind, for the first time ever, I let myself be overcome by intense melancholy. Everything seemed dull, lifeless, sad, insipid... I felt my strength had gone. I was becoming fragile. Fragile... What a hateful word. Hello, Lisette. - Hello, FÃ©elix. - How are you? - Very well. - Just one today. Have a good day, Lisette. See you soon. A letter, Father. Coffee's ready. What a letter! And so kindly delivered. Lisette... You're an angel. I wish I was, but you know, Father, the postman is our angel. You are, Lisette. I'll wait for you at home, this Wednesday at midnight. Please come here as discreetly as possible. You'll find the front door unlocked. Walk straight across the kitchen. Quietly. Very quietly. Grandma is a light sleeper. Wait for a second at my door, in silence, and leave again when the door closes. Rose. You are so beautiful, my sweet. So beautiful. The stars gazed down at me but I felt alone in the world. I thus busied myself, happy, still marked by my holy dove's luminous body. At the climax, my gaze met that of the heavenly vault. Up there, Venus shone in all her glory. "Love," I thought as I writhed. That thought struck me so hard that I wanted to see my joy pierce the sky. I felt the sap rise... and the dazzling fire of the goddess carried me off. We'll see next week. - Goodbye. - Have a good Sunday. I never imagined you could write a letter. It's not easy but I so wanted to. I'll be alone at the farm all day on Monday. I wanted to tell you those hours will be ours. Here... Let me put my helmet down... It's very pretty. - It's your hair? - Yes, I cut it for you. I'll be going. Till Monday. Lord, you open your hand and satisfy every living being's desires. In the cool of the day, when the shadows lengthen, I shall go to the mount of incense and the hills of myrrh. You are beautiful, my sweet. So beautiful. Your eyes behind your veil are doves. Your teeth are like a flock of ewes returning from washing. Your lips are like a scarlet thread and your mouth is lovely. Your cheek is like a slice of pomegranate behind your veil. Your neck is like the tower of David on which are hung a thousand shields. Your two breasts are like two fawns feeding among the lilies. Your hair is like purple. A king is chained to these locks. Receive this crown. O Venus, my queen. My God, such rapture. Tell me, is young Rose a good student? I saw her give you a bouquet. As thanks for my work with the group. You were very moved. The word is too strong. She's a minor. Armance, don't imagine such baseness where it doesn't exist. You truly feel nothing for that girl? Yes. I swear. I'm not the monster you think I am. Look around. Aren't people happy? I'm talking about you. Me? I'll come to you after football. I'll dispel these dark thoughts. Nothing to say? I'm no longer your St Francis? Come on, have faith. They'll catch cold. Promises are made to be kept. After training, I went straight to Armance's. In next to no time, I brilliantly dispelled her suspicions. Over the next few days, the bad weather set in. But a few dark clouds wouldn't dampen my high spirits. Sure I was in control, sure of myself, sure of my fate, I accelerated and accelerated... I think it's a write-off. Shall I drive you to the village? Father... I believed I controlled my life's course but I had to face the facts. Here below, perhaps I wasn't the decision-maker, the alpha and omega, the beginning and the end. Mary Magdalene... Who locked you in here? You know... if my little Rose were like you, I'd still love her as much. Hairs, hairs... Little hairs... Hello. Rose... My Rose. I have something important to tell you. Really? I didn't know if I should but I think you ought to know. The thing is... I'm pregnant. Pregnant? I'm sure. The doctor confirmed it. I knew you'd take it badly. Listen... This is a bit complicated. We need to discuss it serenely. I'll come to see you tomorrow and we'll talk calmly. Obviously, that very day, I ran to the arms of an old mistress to forget this tragic moment. Alas... How can I explain this? Alas, nothing worked. Even worse, I had to bear more platitudes... Don't look so glum. I know you, remember. I know what you're capable of. What a tragedy! Want a pick-me-up? See you later. Pica... - Who's there? - It's me. Come in, I'm alone. Oh, my friends... It's very hard for me to tell you what happened there, behind that door. As in some cheap photo story, everything was so hackneyed and heard countless times before. He, striving again to impress upon her that she should abort. She, obstinately insisting on keeping this useless child. He, losing patience with her. She, daring to threaten him. Yes, threaten him. After he gave her all his love. She wanted to denounce him if he forced her to abort. I feel the gesture matched the threat. As for my subsequent reaction, I feel it was less ideal. Sorry, I didn't mean to. - Get out! - I'm sorry. I won't do it again. - Rose! My darling Rose! - Go away! Let go! Kiss me. I love you. I love you. You're hurting me! Kiss me! - You're hurting me! - Come here... Let go of me! Look at this lunatic. Stark raving mad. What can I say, as you see me run like crazy through the woods. Recent images were clashing uncontrollably in my mind. I couldn't understand or believe what had happened. However, it was simple enough. Clinging to my shoulders, the filthy little imp was dragging me to the abyss. Hello, sir, this is for you. - Please forgive me. - I never will. I made the effort to come to you. And you'll hear me out in the house of God. Listen carefully. I'll only say this once. If you try to see me again, or try to approach me, if you loiter near my grandmother's house, if you try to meet me by any means, I'll speak out. Everyone will know who this child's father is and that you attacked me. I was sorry. I'll do penance. - I'll be merciless with myself. - Don't be so pathetic. I never want to see you again. I'll leave the church now, but don't follow me. Don't move until I have gone. Farewell. Lord... with you... we'll go into the wilderness. On the evening of the fifth day, hungry, I suddenly saw a table of my favourite food appear before me. But when I tried to take it, I felt only stones beneath my hands. On the seventh day, I forget if it was an order from God or my empty stomach that urged me to dress again and leave the wilderness. It'll be hard to accept. Especially on a Sunday. It was good to come and act here together. Besides, the death of a theatre is sad. Isn't it? You don't agree? We've finished. You don't regret your decision? It's such a pity. There's something else. We should stop seeing each other. Thank you, but I think I realized that. No, I mean as friends too. It's too painful coming here without the right to embrace you. Please, spare me your lament. - I have work. I'll go. - Listen! Let's just say we need a little distance. I shall not hamper you in any way and you're free to come back to me when you want. That may not be possible. You love another. You're wrong, I told you. Allow me to doubt. There's nothing between that girl and me. Why must we part then? I simply wish to devote myself to my ministry. This sudden seriousness doesn't resemble you. Yet it's the simple truth. I have only one wish. To become an ordinary priest. Do you know what, Mr Priest? Your banality already bores me. That autumn, I resigned as coach. The winter was icy. In my mind, everything seemed to have stopped, fallen asleep... And, with me, the world itself. With the return of spring, I was brought out of limbo. - I woke you. - I was just getting up. If you have coffee, I have a brioche. Come in. Give me a minute to dress. It's been a long time, hasn't it? Have a seat. I'll make coffee. Thank you. Tell me... Did you know Rose and her grandmother were back? I didn't know they had left. Do you know why? Imagine, the girl's pregnant. The baby's due shortly. There's something troubling about all this. Something that bothers me. We don't know who the father is. Do you have a knife? Yes, I'll fetch one. So I was thinking, back when you had your theatre group, perhaps you saw her on her boyfriend's arm. Not that I remember. I confessed her grandmother. The girl has told her nothing. So I went to see her. "It's all over," was all she would say. "It's all over." Would that have satisfied you? I don't think so. Together, we'll manage to find out. Lisette? Is that you? Here they are! Sorry, sir. Now everyone is here, we can go. After these events, the Lord came to test Abraham. He told him, "Abraham, take your son, your only son, the one you love, Isaac. Go to the land of Moriah and, there, sacrifice him on the mountain I indicate to you." Abraham girded up his soul, took his son and left for the place indicated by the Lord. Several days later, they arrived at the mountain. There, Abraham drew the sacrificial knife. Isaac said to his father, "Father, you have drawn the knife but where is the sheep to sacrifice?" "God will provide the sheep, my son." Abraham attached Isaac and carried him to the altar. Laying his strong hand on the fragile face, he bared the neck. And then, armed with his knife, he raised his hand to strike. But the Lord's angel called from heaven, "Abraham! Do not lay a hand on your son and do not hurt him for now I know you didn't refuse to sacrifice your own child. I know that you fear the Lord, your God." Sir... It's raining. Where is that key? It has to be somewhere... Maybe in here... Father, you scared me! The upstairs room is locked, Father. Don't clean it anymore. Don't worry about me. I have enough energy... That's not the issue, Lisette. I don't want you doing that room for now. As you wish... I'll give you these then. - Your meal is ready. - Goodbye, Lisette. Good night, Father. How to mend such disorder? Rose could give birth here any day now. I made myself a promise. If it were to happen, that room would be their tomb. The Lord will perhaps prefer a different outcome. If that is the case, as for Abraham, he must hold back my hand. The body of Christ. Oh, my God... Why have you abandoned me? Dear God! Mr Mayor! Mr Mayor! - My God! - Murdered. Tell him to hurry, we need his help. Father? May I come in? It's you, Lisette. Your hands... The mayor was here. He'd like you to join him down by the Brindille. The gendarmes will be there too. Rose... You know, young Rose... She has been found dead. I'll leave you now. The coffee's ready downstairs. For a second, I tried to understand, but my mind was in turmoil. The path travelled... That foul bird outside her grandmother's house... The silence after the first blows... The smell of the mud by the Brindille... And then sudden emptiness. A black hole. As if returning from nowhere, my return to the presbytery. And this morning, on waking, the images of the night returned. Strange... Unreal... Her open belly... And that thing... That accursed thing... that I had to pull out, baptize, kill, disfigure... The evening of my arrest, a shroud fell over the countryside. And that black veil never lifted. Today too, I don't hear the city awake. No clamour, no noise... Nothing. I shall now fall silent and you who have listened to me so patiently, you'll return home. On your way back, light a little cigarette, walk slowly... You'll have time to ponder my story. I can hear the disbelievers stubbornly making me the ideal culprit. But I forgive them. We all have our weak points. In any case, whatever your verdict, know this at least: I lied about nothing. I take that certainty with me to the grave. Within the darkness, it will be, my dear friends, my precious little belonging. Subtitles by Ian Burley, a.s.i.f. Subtitling: TITRA FILM Paris
